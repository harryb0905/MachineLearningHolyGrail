@antoniogm @harryh @kevinroose @etbrooking ... so to me, the key is to reject the premise of the question and find a way to decentralize FB's offerings so that it's not in the position to make, or be asked to make, such far-reaching content decisions. Then it can make narrow-reaching ones!
@antoniogm @harryh @kevinroose @etbrooking I share the instinct that there's less individuated ethical responsibility for content the lower down in the stack a firm's services can be found (and more, up!).

@marienewhouse This calls for a conversation beyond the constraints of twitter!
@jvagle @SteveBellovin A classic.
@marienewhouse Sure, but it‚Äôs not consistent with risk spreading. (Hence the need for subsidies to ... respread the risk that the well-functioning market just unspread.)
@zeynep Right?!
So there are at least two potential problems to work through with schemes that price insurance dynamically based on social media posts: (1) they won‚Äôt work; (2) they will work.
What gets lost in this is that insurance is about risk-spreading, and risk is about uncertainty. More ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù results in individual insurance prices converging towards the cost of the personal calamities that are said to lie ahead depending on each of thousands of decisions.
This will be the opposite of home insurance being cheaper if you put in a smoke alarm. It‚Äôll be prices that move in arbitrary ways ‚Äî and potentially daily or hourly ‚Äî or a series of seemingly-nonsensical actions recommended by third-party advising apps.  ‚ÄúWear a green hat today!‚Äù
The app won‚Äôt be able to say why it‚Äôs telling you not to post a picture (or, more fundamentally, do what the picture portrays).  Insurance cos will keep their pricing formulas secret so they can‚Äôt be gamed, because the rate tell-tales will be based on correlation, not causation.
... if this really takes off, it‚Äôll be a race to optimize rates by crunching data to surface any correlations, not just what we‚Äôd think obvious like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt post skydiving pictures.‚Äù  The result:  An insurance advising app that previews an innocuous-looking post and says, ‚Äúnaah.‚Äù
If your insurance rates are affected by your social media posts, brace for advice like that of the WSJ, below, to present (and live?) your life not for your Instagram pals but for ... your insurer. The way homeowners insurance helpfully encourages smoke detectors, except ... https://t.co/DGR1dG0fR3

@sivavaid Thanks - and just queuing up your Slate piece!
@ProfJayDaigle Yes, but (1) it wasn't expressly permitted -- the shrug of a FB login was taken as sufficient permissions thanks to the special partnership; (2) giving full access to all msgs so I can send "I like this song" through FB violates the PoLP; and (3) FB doesn't get (1) and (2).
If Facebook can't admit error -- even mere imprudence -- today, and focuses more on its partnerships (and attendant data transfers) than its users, it's Facebook who isn't "getting it." And that this is typical for dot-coms -- "industry standard" -- makes this a systemic problem.
So Will is generous when he concludes that FB's practices here were imprudent, but hardly a scandal. What's telling is how much FB's mindset about it appears not to itself have evolved, even as we've all reaped a whirlwind of privacy and security breaches in the past few years.
Maybe three years ago these security issues and privacy concerns weren't as salient. But they rightfully are now, and FB's defensive, annoyed reactions of today don't wash: "Gosh, you users authorized all this with a click, so you have nothing to complain about."
Facebook does not much follow this, and we've all paid the price for it. The linkages of Facebook Connect meant that a compromise of up to 90 million Facebook accounts (!) also compromised other web sites that users had connected by logging in using FB. https://t.co/peRVCQAd4M
The Principle of Least Privilege says that a process should have "only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function." And that makes sense: it's why one key can open a room but another key is needed for a file cabinet in the room. https://t.co/AAGWPeMxGj
I might trust Facebook to handle my private messaging. But using FB to sign into some other site isn't alone meaning to trust that other site with FB private messages. And putting privacy aside for a moment, it's terrible security. It violates the Principle of Least Privilege.
"Our integration partners had to get authorization from people. You would have had to sign in with your Facebook account to use the integration offered by Apple, Amazon or another integration partner." But that's a red herring. Signing in using FB doesn't mean "read my inbox."
These special partnerships yielded special access to Facebook users' private messages. A typical third party app can't get that.  Did users knowingly authorize this? Another Facebook VP in "Let‚Äôs Clear Up a Few Things About Facebook‚Äôs Partners," says yes. https://t.co/YFciPhgRcG
"These partnerships were agreed via extensive negotiations and documentation, detailing ... what data they could and couldn‚Äôt access." (Of course, that documentation isn't publicly available. The VP points to a Mashable article instead. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø https://t.co/l5IgAoLfdd)
Facebook's VP of product partnerships, responding to the controversy, says this is all totally normal: "People could message their friends about what they were listening to on Spotify or watching on Netflix..." https://t.co/MbqTa0ZcyH https://t.co/8uvKHtKfcN
For example, it appears that by using Facebook credentials to sign into Spotify (using a familiar screen like the one below), a special partnership with Facebook allowed Spotify to be given access to Facebook users' private messages. https://t.co/mtOn1RLtHM
But Will then says that in this particular case (the 21st of 2018, by Wired's count, https://t.co/gwoEeXuNW9), it's actually not a big deal. And I usually share that disposition: breathless news accounts of wrongdoing are often overstated or misunderstood. Here I'm not so sure.
Will says that "what has changed is that Facebook has forfeited our trust to the point that we are primed to assume the worst of it." And I think that's true -- hence pieces like @zeynep's coverage of Mark Z's "14 year apology tour," https://t.co/3LNQreTPmE.

This piece nicely lays out why "anonymous location sharing" is a lie.

@seanwbrooks Well, sure. Secure the basket, secure the eggs. But the Fort Knox approach is at its worst when a single account is used for applications from the sublime (and vital) to the ridiculous ‚Äî and that a real name is demanded, making targeted hacking that much easier.
Years ago Dan Geer warned of the dangers of software monocultures.

Dan was right. https://t.co/ZMfo07gSlW
@poeteguerisseur Appears to be yes, in the sense that the method of attack gained access tokens for already-logged-in accounts, whatever the original method of login had been.

And the marketplace of ideas story includes the assumption that the truth will out - or at least this is the best way to try to make that happen.  Then I think of Twain‚Äôs ‚Äúa lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.‚Äù  Should FB help w/laces?
It‚Äôs been a tough realization for some that the very tools that seemed to broaden and strengthen the ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas‚Äù are themselves readily available to shape it to particular outcomes.
If Gen. LeMay were a private contractor, that is.
As a friend observed, it‚Äôs like we've had the uncomfortable realization that our nuclear arsenal is in the custody of General LeMay and his colleagues, and we're demanding they be confiscated from them.
Perhaps we want a world in which the landscape is fragmented and no one or two entities gets to say what rises or falls - making virality more happenstance? (Bring back the roulette wheel!)
This is a dangerous situation for the flow of speech. And part of the danger is that there‚Äôs no answer that‚Äôs easy to come up with, much less to implement.
True. But Facebook is already finding itself in that position; circulation of information is no longer left as much to chance, because of platform concentration and extensive data crunching to exquisitely determine the platforms‚Äô views of ‚Äúrelevance.‚Äù https://t.co/k8h8gTs1Vq
@IdentityMonk Today‚Äôs example: https://t.co/FnvlIfrsnj
Yes. With a news feed algorithm of even modest complexity, Facebook is kingmaking.  It may do that without judging content itself, either through ‚Äúwhat leads to engagement‚Äù or ‚Äúhow our users or third parties rate truthfulness,‚Äù but it‚Äôs still FB‚Äôs call, and it has few peers. https://t.co/3sI9zOy2BJ

@IdentityMonk Agreed! When an algorithm seizes on a proxy, instead of the actual phenomenon, it can fail in weird and unexpected ways. The hard challenge is when and how proxies are OK ‚Äî since we use them ourselves a lot.
@IdentityMonk Surely the morphine example is a fail. But the other examples aren‚Äôt in that category, I think.  Suppose the algorithm you mentioned judged on the basis of visual tumor size, and *didn‚Äôt* need the ruler. Same ultimate criteria - but now just crude rather than wrong, yes?

@aedwardslevy Foot bull?
I suspect that laws held unconstitutional, but not repealed, will be found to be biding their time for return. Because a Court activist enough to start reversing itself on a bunch of issues will, regrettably, be activist enough to want old laws to see new life. /end
(By one count from the @Guttmacher Institute, ten states have unenforced pre-Roe abortion bans still on their books.) https://t.co/taD4JIZFdq
Plus there might be lots of statutes never enforced or challenged that are clearly unconstitutional thanks to a holding about a similar statute in another state. This happened with Roe v. Wade, which invalidated a number of state abortion laws. If Roe is reversed, are they back?
It seems that then Kentucky‚Äôs statute would be read again according to its original, unedited text. Why, then, should wholly invalidated, but never repealed, statutes really be treated any differently?
Such a law was indeed held unconstitutional. But instead of striking it down, the Court‚Äôs decision simply required Kentucky to allow same-sex marriage too, contrary to the law‚Äôs text. So suppose that Obergefell itself is later overturned by a Court with a new Justice or two?
He pointed out that 2015‚Äôs Obergefell case, in which the Court provided for same-sex marriage throughout the US, didn‚Äôt strike down state marriage laws like Kentucky‚Äôs that explicitly said that marriage was ‚Äúonly‚Äù between ‚Äúone (1) man and one (1) woman.‚Äù
Eric S. Fish, while a doctoral student in law at Yale, made a provocative analogy that backs up this second theory about struck-down laws coming back to life. https://t.co/QbOcHuUVzi
So by this second, narrow theory, a ‚Äústruck down‚Äù law is ready to re-animate should the Court change its mind. And the attorney general in a given jurisdiction could try enforcing the old law every so often, testing whether the Court is ready to reawaken it.
(Here‚Äôs Article I, section 2, with the notorious ‚Äúthree fifths‚Äù House representation calculation helpfully linked by @LIICornell to the 14th Amendment. It‚Äôs still ‚Äúin‚Äù the Constitution, despite that and the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery.) https://t.co/T48xnSr3er
Well-annotated statutes will flag parts of legislative codes that are no longer good law, a kind of scholarly ‚Äústep around the roadkill‚Äù warning when there‚Äôs no legislative clean-up. Edited versions of the Constitution also flag pieces that don‚Äôt make sense anymore.
There‚Äôs another, more narrow theory. This theory agrees that when laws are found unconstitutional, they must stop being enforced. But the theory stops there. The laws remain on the books‚Äîthough inoperative‚Äîunless the legislatures formally repeal them.
So that makes it seem like a law struck down as unconstitutional is gone, and if the Supreme Court later reverses itself and finds that what was previously unconstitutional is now OK, a legislature will have to re-pass the original law for it to come back into effect.
And in McCulloch v. Maryland, Marshall wrote that ‚ÄúShould Congress ‚Ä¶ adopt measures which are prohibited by the Constitution ‚Ä¶ it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, ‚Ä¶ to say that such an act was not the law of the land.‚Äù
In Marbury v. Madison (1803), Chief Justice Marshall said that ‚Äúa law repugnant to the constitution is void.‚Äù
But what happens to a struck-down law if the Court changes its mind and reverses an earlier decision? Does the old law spring back to life, or does the legislature have to pass it again? This might seem like a simple, easy-to-answer question, but it turns out that it‚Äôs not.
It‚Äôs long settled that the Court can rule laws unconstitutional, and unconstitutional laws are no longer enforceable. That‚Äôs because Article VI says that the Constitution is the ‚Äúsupreme Law of the Land,‚Äù and under Article III the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land.
Thread/ There's an unresolved question about the Supreme Court that I've been puzzling over, one which might become relevant with a new Justice joining the court. ‚Ä¶

@jessekblum @sheevanesva I trust that Siri wasn‚Äôt putting a thumb on the scale by autocorrecting the doctors‚Äô oath you mentioned to be the ‚Äúhypocritical‚Äù one.
@jessekblum @sheevanesva Just to nail this down: there‚Äôs (in some cases) ability to choose among doctors. But still a duty of loyalty owed. Would you be in favor of eliminating that duty in favor of market discipline?
@jessekblum @sheevanesva If the facts were to end up pointing in the direction of advisor, would you change your mind?

@jessekblum @sheevanesva We should watch how much they hold themselves out as trusted friends, and also the extent to which their advice is derived from our personal data.  Each militates towards a duty of loyalty that a shopkeeper (and most others in commerce) do not owe, but advisors do and should.
@jessekblum @sheevanesva I think the play for concierges is to be trusted advisors ‚Äî a role very different from a supermarket shelf and the grocer behind it.
@jessekblum Maybe the most different thing here is that a choice of concierge may be made quickly but then become long-term and very hard to switch away from. Even monopoly issues aside, that can make it hard for the market to discipline consumer-exploiting behaviors by the platforms.
@jessekblum That seems ... different ... to me, for all the reasons you can guess.
We need to be able to trust that digital concierges act in our best interests, not their own.  Amazon goes too far when Alexa takes ‚Äúbuy batteries‚Äù to only mean Amazon‚Äôs brand. This should be nipped in the bud.  #informationfiduciaries  https://t.co/veKTXgchYo https://t.co/OYKrAoSBi9

@volt4ire Yes, that'd be written into the terms of the bond.
@BenL Yep, that'd be part of the deal for the bond ...
Agreed. I‚Äôm thinking to start by pricing only the cost of continuing security updates for an abandoned product, rather than the damage caused by exploited vulnerabilities. https://t.co/xVYgB0PjHw
@idokilovaty That's trickier - establishing who was harmed and how much and by whom and through exactly what vulnerability is not easy. So in theory, yes, but in practice, I'd start incrementally.
https://t.co/B7NOkxGAG7
And networked stuff modeled on boring analogs -- like connected coffeemakers or TVs or alarm clocks or cars -- should be able to function without Internet access. Should security support cease, they can fall back to this "Faraday mode" and remain useful without vulnerability.
Insurance companies can price those bonds for those companies who don't want to stake them all themselves. The pricing will nicely vary according to whether the company respects basic security practices.
Companies that end up producing a bunch of connected products should be required to post a bond -- ready to be cashed in to help support the product's security if the company should prematurely wander away.
Security updates evaporate as manufacturers go under or lose interest in a connected product -- even as a loyal fan base keeps a bunch of them installed. Just as Mozilla breathed new life into Netscape, that base can provide for code updates after a maker has moved on.

They don't think it's a trivial problem, but they think the tech community is sitting on its hands b/c they don't want it to work.
@David_Kasten FWIW: https://t.co/0MoKJBXhYS
@David_Kasten I agree with you, though the other side of the debate isn't subjectively concerned with something as trivial as a shorter commute. I have found it less persuasive to minimize rather than acknowledge the general concerns of some LE reps, and to declare no proposal could ever work.
@David_Kasten That's certainly true for ability to stand a once-in-a-XX-year wind or whatever -- I take it the TNB is colloquially "stable" full stop, meeting some kind of bridge standard, but it still might not be stable enough.
@fugueish @rozzie Of course, the real issue - as @StevenLevy also covered - is that OS-accessible data at rest on a locked phone is a small piece of the landscape.  Technology mandates for, say, Signal would require a massive and awful regulatory intervention in the current ecosystem.
@fugueish @rozzie ‚ÄúBack door‚Äù vs ‚Äúnot a back door,‚Äù or secure vs insecure, because auto firmware updates are themselves effective forms of back doors, persuasively differentiated only by scale (MG‚Äôs point) and what‚Äôs unchangeable in a secure enclave.
@saletan @mattyglesias Is it still triangulating if he stands still and moves the corner of the triangle rather than the other way around?
@Arpit_Chauhan @rozzie I imagine so, since he likes products over services ‚Äî owning something and being able to know it rather than having it changed out from under.
A crisp account of @rozzie‚Äôs proposal for gov‚Äôt access to locked smartphones.  While I don‚Äôt think the idea is ultimately a wise move, the analogy to OS updates shows that security here is a spectrum of tradeoffs rather than simple on/off. https://t.co/w0ovbMW2Jk

@ASlavitt @OverlordMarie Is the context that the autism registry is intended to specifically facilitate investigation of the discredited link between autism and vaccines? So much of the statute and amendments seems to concern itself with vaccination and conscientious objection to it.
@irinimalliaraki Poe‚Äôs Law rules all of us!
@irinimalliaraki @Tesla @medialab (And in classes, we‚Äôre all working it through aloud ‚Äî those answers were very helpful in context!)
@irinimalliaraki @Tesla @medialab N.b. This was a role playing exercise, so the ‚ÄúTesla engineer‚Äù was a student!
@HoffProf @joshtpm Heh. Did I end up pinning the tail on the donkey as I clumsily worked it through aloud, or is there more from the listserv?  I confess I teach torts, not contracts. Which may soon be in play too!
@ralphnf1 @joshtpm Yes, I agree this makes it vulnerable. I can also see why S is now saying ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll return the money‚Äù ‚Äî basically she‚Äôd say she had it awaiting T‚Äôs signature to bind him to the provisions only he could agree to, and since he never signed, it never came into force.
@egrassva @joshtpm Yes, I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as a consideration issue, but you‚Äôre right that the contract is promising something that it‚Äôs not clear the signatories can deliver on without DD signing on: Trump not suing.
@joshtpm ... the contract does say the Trump (and his counsel, weirdly) agrees not to sue. I don‚Äôt see how that piece can be delivered upon without Trump (or his designated representative) being a direct party to the contract.  Which I guess is S‚Äôs argument why it‚Äôs not fully consummated.
@joshtpm OK, I just read the contract. Ugh. Agree that the issue isn‚Äôt consideration: she was paid money, and that counts.  And DJT is not agreeing to non-disclosure in it ‚Äî only S is. And weirdly the DJT and EC are ‚Äúand/or‚Äù as parties. But ...
@5DollarFeminist @mc1531 @ArrogantMonkey @ajaxsinger Does someone have a link to the document?
@joshtpm Is there a handy link to the contract? I can‚Äôt seem to find one.
@AnAmericanRiver I think you mean academics. :)
@joshtpm I‚Äôll give the contract a look. Certainly DJT could be a third party beneficiary. If also held out as a party, that‚Äôs confusing ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a misrepresentation (or mistake) that‚Äôs material to the contract. Seems like S‚Äôs central expectation was the payment.
@joshtpm Would it matter to Stormy if DJT was a party? As I try to puzzle this through, maybe the LLC is the party to the contract comprising money in exchange for her silence, not signing on behalf of DJT at all.  I suppose I could contract with you not to say X about Y, without being Y.
@joshtpm Yes, that‚Äôs weird. I realize this is far from a money manager having general permission to trade stocks and then quietly buying Exxon.
@joshtpm Yep, I think that more or less captures my sense of things. Of course a good lawyer would draft more ... general ... language.
@ajaxsinger @joshtpm Oh, I think that‚Äôs reading into a POA. They don‚Äôt necessitate relinquishing control. Just adding an alternative decision maker. (Think of a money manager empowered to trade a client‚Äôs stocks without consultation or even prior notification.)
@AuntSophie1 @joshtpm That‚Äôs one use of a POA. But they can be signed by perfectly competent people and given immediate effect. (In fact the only way signing them works is if he person is competent!)
@joshtpm I don‚Äôt think so. If the client has given sufficient general instructions I think someone duly empowered can take tactical action without consultation.  Plus wasn‚Äôt even a dispute at that point, though, right? It was a payment for nondisclosure. So not a settlement of a lawsuit.
@joshtpm Seems to me that someone with power of attorney can make binding contracts for the person represented without the person having to know.
@therealfitz I confess I wasn‚Äôt ü§Ø when I read the thread. But I see that as part of the point. We are fish who don‚Äôt see the water.

@emptywheel @podehaye TOS between the quiz makers and the users? Would have to think through remedy. In US context, also thin.
@podehaye Anyway, a largely unimportant semantic distinction ‚Äî unless someone‚Äôs wrongly threatening a lawsuit over it.
@podehaye Thanks so much. It doesn‚Äôt look like social engineering in the usual sense, especially if the shutdown were over volume and he was like, ‚Äúsorry, we just have a popular app.‚Äù I think of social engineering as, say, misrepresenting identity. This problem runs sadly deeper.
@podehaye @alexstamos Yes, I did. His account of what happened certainly looked reasonable, but I‚Äôd have to review last year‚Äôs articles to see if it contradicts other reporting. Curious why he deleted them.
@podehaye I see your quote in the Observer, but not word of a phone call. What role does the phone call play in this scenario? I thought the data was acquired by users taking the ‚Äúpersonality test,‚Äù including about their friends, and misused from there?
@davidakaye Surely so.
@podehaye @mireillemoret @RDBinns @1Br0wn @carolecadwalla I just tweeted further about that in light of the links. I had no idea of that context before. (While standing by my view about the term!)
This is nuts if FB‚Äôs quarrel is with the term ‚Äúdata breach,‚Äù and they‚Äôre intimating litigation over it.  I wouldn‚Äôt call it that since it involved a  second-party betrayal of trust rather than an external hack, but it‚Äôs a reasonable metaphor. https://t.co/Jqgx068Ubv
@podehaye @mireillemoret @RDBinns @1Br0wn @carolecadwalla It‚Äôd be nuts to sue over something like that. Can you share a link to the thread?

This is becoming an even deeper problem as AI inches towards accurately inferring sensitive information from innocuous-seeming facts about ourselves that we readily share.  CA may not have cracked that nut, but it‚Äôs where the tech and data environments are headed. https://t.co/mHrHqeq5LK
@mireillemoret @RDBinns Well, speaking as a US legal scholar, I find myself counting on EU regulatory frameworks - including competition ones - to vindicate privacy interests where the US falls short. @1Br0wn
@mireillemoret @1Brown @RDBinns Yes, I did and do agree with these points.
@mireillemoret OK. That is surely a point! Just one separate from first describing what happened, for I think which the phrase ‚Äúdata breach‚Äù is unhelpful/misleading. ‚ÄúUnlawful processing of data,‚Äù sure.  Still confused about the hostility.
@RDBinns @1Br0wn Yeah, my first thought is to get straight what happened. In my view what happened is not a typical data breach. To call it that will likely confuse people who immediately may think this was hacking.  Whether it can be fit in the purview of a ‚Äúdata breach‚Äù law is another Q.
@1Br0wn @RDBinns I don‚Äôt understand your hostility here.  I was not speaking to the country of origin of the journalist (!) when I shared my view, nor meaning to impugn anyone.  If anything, I was thinking of something like SB 1386, which mandates disclosure for data breaches.
@1Br0wn @RDBinns I‚Äôve said it‚Äôs my sense of the common usage. You are of course free to disagree.  But again the key is what hangs on it ‚Äî if there‚Äôs some law you think should apply, but it only works if what happened is a ‚Äúdata breach,‚Äù say so.
@1Br0wn @RDBinns I guess I‚Äôm going off of my understanding of its common usage, both colloquially and as a term of art. I agree it‚Äôs a breach of trust.   Anyway, what hangs on this distinction, in your view? What makes it so important that it be called a data breach?
@1Br0wn @RDBinns When the abuse is coming from ‚Äúinside the house,‚Äù by the intention of the entity you shared your data with, it muddles things to call it a data breach, which suggests outside (that is, third-party) hackers.
@1Br0wn @RDBinns I see it as the difference between second- and third-party betrayals. The most direct bad act here is by a ‚Äúpersonality quiz‚Äù that lied about what it would do with the data users shared with it. There‚Äôs the larger issue of what FB should be doing to prevent bad actors like that.
From a Facebook VP.  He‚Äôs right that the Cambridge Analytica abuse of data shouldn‚Äôt be described as a data breach. It‚Äôs a trust breach.  The real Q is how much this is a design flaw with the whole ecosystem, vs. a bad actor to simply be duly punished. https://t.co/gPqxhzmYgB
@carriecordero @RosenzweigP @lawfareblog Paul, do you see any institutional changes to strengthen the guardrails for situations like this, or do you think the problem is not amenable to traditional oversight?

To visit a Web site is not only to be asked to trust the Web site. It is also to trust every third party ad syndicator whose content is automatically incorporated into the Web site owner‚Äôs pages, and every fourth party advertiser who in turn provides content to that third party.

@little_wow Oh, I‚Äôd think something like endowing (along with other behemoths) a trust that in turns supports librarians where they are ‚Äî in public and private libraries ‚Äî and newly charters them to help assess and explain sources.
Fair point ‚Äî these ad-based models can‚Äôt produce the kind of trust that community- or values-driven orgs can, at least without internal units that aspire to the tenets of modern journalism, like a network news division.

@drs1969 I‚Äôd be concerned almost about the opposite: a real video wouldn‚Äôt much be believed since it‚Äôs so readily faked. But provenance remains key.
@drs1969 I‚Äôm saying that those who find it believable and credible haven‚Äôt been convinced bc of artfully falsified evidence. Does that make sense?
@tdietterich I‚Äôm not as concerned: possible to forge evidence now; chain of custody and other foundation always important to establishing authenticity.

@RichFelker @zeynep Yes. It'd be good to make sure -- personally tailored ads could be shared with a clearinghouse by template. "Hello, %FNAME, buy this!"
@deaneckles Exactly my thinking.
@RichFelker @zeynep You'd have to tell me more. I'm not sure how making public the ad itself is invading privacy, irrespective of who's targeted.
@erikbryn @tdietterich Surely so. At that threshold the ad policy shouldn't allow targeting. If misalignment, weigh value of privacy vs. public ad disclosure.
@deaneckles Hard on Twitter to get the nuance that experts usually dwell in. :) But the clearinghouse I'm thinking of would be only the ads ...?
@tdietterich @erikbryn Right now FB rightly prohibits ad targeting so refined that it can only reach (and therefore ID) one person. Should stay that way.
@jmreagle Usual reason given is that reporters don't want to presume intent, and to let readers decide. Not sure how that's applied to the WP blogs.

@jonst0kes The corollary to "The Internet sees censorship as damage and routes around it" should be: The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
@jonst0kes Yeah, in a way that's what made @Lessig's Code powerful - it was contrarian to the conventional wisdom.

@kragen @metasj ... games by patient and well-paid advocates who can cover obvious tell-tales that they're coordinated with one another.
@kragen @metasj It'd be interesting to think about what tripwires to set to see if it's happening. But a system devoted to earnest discussion can be ...
@kragen @metasj I don't know of any good examples, tbh. I worry prospectively given the ratcheting up of state actor activity in Net propaganda.
@metasj I think there are distinct issues for a community-governed and -edited project w/ (laudably) no boundary between outside and inside.

@alemannoEU @Harvard_Law @Harvard @hlrecord Heh - I think that three bushels trademark is officially abandoned!
@DavidKMagnus @EFF Well, the current model is that ID'ing info is maintained by cos for their own benefit as business records; subpoenas then reach it.
@1337p337 @normative @admrlcrnch @davidfrum @EFF Yeah, something to that -- ppl's opinions depend on their threat models. Also the rare situations when speech *is* an actionable threat.
@DavidKMagnus @EFF I take a back door to be something achieved through a hack, or by a mandate that takes the vendor or service provider out of the equation.
@obarcala @EFF Yeah, I didn't mean my tweet to be the equivalent of that.  The EFF report itself talks about &gt; law enforcement (rather than more laws).
@obarcala @EFF It's a track record of longer writings that would suggest congruence or not. Otherwise the answer slides towards "don't tweet."
@obarcala @EFF It might. I guess a single tweet, necessarily unsubtle and easily misread -- even when "perhaps'd" -- shouldn't be construed as apostasy.
@DavidKMagnus @EFF Tweets are terrible for subtlety, but it's about front, not back, doors, and thinking through app-level access floor and ceiling.
@obarcala @EFF Academics speak in our own capacity, not those of orgs. My own view on backdoors is here: https://t.co/0MoKJBXhYS.

@normative @davidfrum Absolutely. In some instances perhaps pseudonymity rather than anonymity can help. Name not revealed, but guarded path back to author.
Either it's newsworthy or not. To make a moral judgment explictly and publicly part of the calculus makes CNN unduly part of the story.

@dandrezner Well, he did put it in quotes ... :/
@lpfeed For some zones of the humanities, I think of it like a work of modern art that is very well regarded and then artist says: my dog made it.
@willwilkinson Thx. And is it a gestalt? Basically how moved you and other editors feel from having read the poem, what it evokes in you?
@lpfeed The hoax worked, full stop. But I'm not sure its working meant what he and others thought it meant.
@SophiaRoosth first as tragedy, then as farce ...
@SophiaRoosth Thanks!  In his case, not clear who the peers would be, since he was styling the work as so ambitiously cross-disciplinary.
@SophiaRoosth Interesting! How did it decide on what to publish in a time when there were only so many pages per journal? Did it go by author, not paper?
@willwilkinson I'd love to see a typical review for a poem -- I've never seen one before. Does it reference technical aspects, how reader feels, etc. ...?
I'd love to see a more common practice where papers that aren't accepted can still be published, along with the peer review they garnered. https://t.co/mYZM29Xkn4
@willwilkinson Indeed! *Too* demanding, I think. Especially in an era where paper and distribution aren't limiting, why restrict what people might see?
@davidpetersimon Yeah, as @zeynep says, that's a vanity journal issue rather than a peer review one. That vanity journals can "work" indicts academia.
For some fields, it seems like asking whether a poem should fail peer review. There may be better and worse poetry, but why impose PR there? https://t.co/zgsQPGTlTs

@AdamSearles1 @dweinberger I think that covers a big piece of a "pro-human" instinct, yes. Though in many areas we see emotional sways as bias.
@EvanSelinger @rcalo @TAPolicy @BrettFrischmann Excellent!
@ThatAndromeda @jstickgoldsarah @dweinberger Yes, exactly. Did not want to define better in a circular way.
@ThatAndromeda @jstickgoldsarah @dweinberger On the lie detector? I'd remain conflicted about using it even if it were perfect.
@jstickgoldsarah @ThatAndromeda @dweinberger ... even if a machine could hypothetically be better. Would I still want to watch a funny show if script completely machine-generated?
@jstickgoldsarah @ThatAndromeda @dweinberger I'm working through my own conflicting instincts about what should be left to human discretion full stop, for the dignity of all ...
@ThatAndromeda @jstickgoldsarah @dweinberger That begs the question of whether that detector could be built, for the sake of exploring other questions about, say, compelled testimony.
@ThatAndromeda @jstickgoldsarah @dweinberger Yeah, some thought experiments assume what otherwise is in dispute. "Suppose there were a perfect lie detector. Should courts compel use?"
@jstickgoldsarah @ThatAndromeda @dweinberger I'm leading with the thought experiment presuming it's "better" in some definable way, rather than having figured out how to make it better.

@aaronrutkoff @promethea Yes! Do not want is abandonment of journalism as profession. But I don't want FB as editor any more than Comcast.
@TheKevinCasas I'm not sure I'd throw, say, all defamation law out the window. Or assault by threat. But those are tight 1st A exceptions.
@AdamGismondi Certainly efforts to deal with truth and reliability.  Fitful ones to see how to help structure dialogue among people.
@jodikantor Yes, RT'd it from @ryanlcooper earlier today. Missed it when it first went around - very striking, and useful for teaching.
@jodikantor I'd love such a thing. Could even have a way of structuring convos w/strangers on other side - who subscribe to desire to learn.
@liammcgee Some ground can be covered here. But many second-order effects as there are huge incentives to game system.

@HoldernessEU @machinestarts But they don't publish the way artisonal publishers do -- these are huge data flows. Liability should be light.

@stannenb They'd be able to write code that operates on personal data but doesn't see it. Facebook is still the compiler, as it were.
@anotherMikeD Agreed. Though in this case they'd offer up feed processors -- code instead of data/stories.
@TheKevinCasas that's roughly what I'm getting at. (note that even under the 1st A there are circumstances where lies aren't protected.)
@JakeLaperruque I think it'd be similar to the sorts of second-order scrutiny that exists for other user-rating systems.
@bobpoekert @emptywheel I'll revisit the doco. If you're right, many of the building blocks are already there.
@bobpoekert @emptywheel it doesn't give the items that are the "losing candidates" for the feed. It's just access to FB's feed.
@bobpoekert @emptywheel Sad that Facebook bought it -- and then shut it down. Current FB APIs wouldn't allow is successor.
@lieven Well, that could surely be a main feed, or even the default. But weird to think we wouldn't organize. Even email is threaded!
@starkness I guess I'm saying that having a single company decide the truth and "nudge" people that way doesn't solve that problem.
@lieven The FIFO days are behind us, though. We can't straitjacket our feeds into just that format.
@starkness Yeah, I was putting that in the "shallow" category. Much more easily solved. (And will have to be, since it can move markets.)
27 (and last)/ Save the filter bubble for the next problem -- one that a centralized algorithm can‚Äôt fix. [END thread.]
26/ Facebook should welcome this. It lessens regulatory pressure, especially in Europe, and FB can salt externally-sourced feeds with FB ads
25/ Solve Facebook‚Äôs vertical integration among data, friend graph, and feed algorithm first.
24/ But to ask FB to wade in to judge the content of sites that people genuinely like + trust courts a worse problem than the original bias.
23/ There's more beyond "like" and "share" to help people looking more for information than fun help examine their own assumptions.
22.5/ (It's a travesty how little the interfaces of FB and Twitter have evolved over the past couple of years.)
22/ Facebook -- and Twitter -- can and should devise new interfaces for better interactions among disagreeing friends and followers.
21/ For popular ‚Äúnews‚Äù sites that are wildly biased -- a single Facebook feed cannot possibly solve this deep problem.
20/ ... that‚Äôs OK, when they know it‚Äôs hoax (shallow prob); it‚Äôs choosing Big Bang Theory or Game of Thrones over the news or a documentary.
19/ The filter bubble problem is a *different problem* from the fake news one. If people want to look at fake news, ...
18/ People would be able to cocoon themselves even more if they choose feed makers like them.
17/ Note that this does not deal with the ‚Äúfilter bubble‚Äù problem. It might even worsen it.
16/ You could have MITers, Ralph Nader, the RNC, the NYT - or a combo - offer feed rankers.
15/ Facebook should allow anyone to write an algorithm to populate someone‚Äôs feed; people can then choose, including in combinations.
14/ The key is to have the companies actually be the *platforms* they claim they are:
13/ And even if it did it ‚Äúwell,‚Äù there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôd keep doing it the way you want.
12/ It‚Äôs too much for any one company to bear to be the arbiter of what‚Äôs biased or not.
11/ Because there are currently one of them for each format: Facebook, Twitter, Google News.
10/ We ask them to become intentional, agenda-setting meta-journalists at real peril.
9/ In fact, it‚Äôs a danger: they both see themselves as platform companies, not news ones.
8/ Here I don‚Äôt see how Facebook or Google News can be asked to do a whole lot.
7/ The deep version of the fake news problem is tougher: biased stories from popular sites.
6/ The key to the shallow problem is that nearly all users recognize it and want it solved.
5/ Could addtl‚Äôy see a new "Oops, I clicked it again" button for users encountering a hoax.
4/ That problem is pretty easy to fix. Tools against spam and even malware can be repurposed.
3/ When people click and immediately regret it -- "I fell for click bait!" -- that's it.
2/ The shallow problem is found in fake sites that publish anything to gain clicks for ads.
1/ The fake news problem on platforms like Facebook and Google has shallow and deep versions.

@BeccaMorn Eh, I don't know yet. It's not illegal to talk to a Russian, or a Russian bank, or to have a server do so.
@BeccaMorn Yes, but it raises lots of issues with authenticating.  The claims built on the data are very public.
@ljean @DavidNemer Thanks. Any hypothesis on what the servers would possibly be facilitating, beyond general human2human comms?
I'm skeptical, but deeply respect the ppl in the "Union of Concerned Nerds." They should release the white paper they wrote. https://t.co/4YBZWrSHx4
@DavidNemer Yeah, that says something about who but not how! @ljean, are there plans to release the white paper(s)?
@strugglesession @pwnallthethings Which in turn calls the data itself into question, no? Would love to see the white paper the article cites
@pwnallthethings Do you have a sense of how the DNS logs are supposed to have become public, and how the log patterns proved authenticity?
@rascouet Well, @FranklinFoer is the real deal, and in the article he works through his own Qs and skepticism.
@chris0s A typical name server wouldn't share that data, I think, and if it has it certainly hasn't done so publicly ...

@csoghoian I'm going to version up this draft, I think, and if I do I'll devote some attention to this issue.  Thanks.
@csoghoian Yes - I think that leaves the distinction of publishing all the stuff that's compromised. That's the act I worry about here.
@csoghoian is not merely collecting intelligence, but then disclosing it to embarrass, chill and harass individuals. A different box. 2/2
@csoghoian No, and I favor increasing protections for non-US citizens under US law and practice. But the practice I most worry about ... 1/2
@csoghoian You mean as a kind of reciprocity? E.g., why shouldn't they hack us if we reserve right to hack them?
@jackshafer No, certainly not in the normal case. But I thought you were offering it up as an example you thought was a plus.
@jackshafer Conflicted. They were going after gov't info from a gov't office - a different set of issues than private/party correspondence.
@JakeLaperruque True.  I see those leaks as bridges towards today's situation, rather than of it.

@JonStall2009 I think there's a glossed-over difference between public officials and public figures. Celebrity photo hacks were wrong too.
@MaraWilson Thanks for coming out to the Brattle tonight - and for all you do to make this web site wonderful. :) -JZ
@2Twitte39301335 It did, or at least it has now: https://t.co/TXGpzJxmE0. If it didn't have orig. leaks, may not have seen for 1st report.
@Javi31280 it's a guy emailing with his friends about his views of people. Doesn't appear to speak to corruption at all.
@shadream But no claim of that here. This is just Colin Powell chatting with his friends about politics and who he does and doesn't like.
@GroundedLiberal Colin Powell is not (and has never been) an elected official.
@Patchoulimommy Colin Powell is not a public official now -- the email long post-dates his gov't service.
@FayesVision The press sees the email in the public domain, rightly concludes audience will want to read it, so publishes. But not normal.
@Sambasue Unfortunately that's a recipe for living in a surveillance state. It might be true, but it's not acceptable.
@Pinboard dystopian and ultra-dystopian?
@eksith I don't think a stint in government service should make it forever OK to have one's email discussing politics w/friends hacked.
@stephwillerton Yes. But I worry we're becoming inured to it. And media can't help but become an instrument to it.
@NyackTrader So said Col. Jessup! But he was duly under oath ...
@KonciseD But not a free society!  I am free to clunk.
@FrancImperator I don't think there's even any suggestion of corruption here, though, even by the leaker.
@BenDover0306 Yes. So far as I know he's not in government service, nor was when he wrote the email.
@rootlesssports I find this @DanielSolove piece helpful - https://t.co/sUlLkqPk0J.
@FrancImperator No particular narrative with owell. Might be a fitting example because he appears to have harshed on both nominees.
@CorettaJackson Take away the digital places and there aren't many places left for freedom of communication.  :/
@CroftLaurie Where I get stuck is that this is a private citizen, not running for office, expressing his private views about politicians.
@digiphile And to think about difference between government and institutional transparency on the one hand and personal privacy on the other
@BenDover0306 No, I support FOIA and other transparency by gov't. But these are emails by a private citizen.
@pvineetha @vyrus001 A really bad thought, regardless of truth -- since it will cause ppl to keep "risky" thoughts to themselves. Unhealthy.
The routinization of hacking and releasing private citizens' email is deeply corrosive to a free society. https://t.co/YZfYDQdlPM

@isocny @crovitz's view is earnestly held. I don't agree with him, but I enjoyed our discussion.
@jimkillock @OpenRightsGroup @AlecMuffett for better or worse I imagine ISP gets first whack at resolution unless client has changed DNS?
@OpenRightsGroup @jimkillock how about if ISPs gave a warning instead of redirecting, a la Google's badware warnings for search results?
When I talked @ICANN with @crovitz, he worried about US "giveaway," but I think current USG plan is good for the Net https://t.co/6j84eAKXKQ

@mollyali Yea - too often HIPAA is invoked as a reason not to do something, inc. granting patient access. Sometimes right, more often not!
@mollyali I'm not sure what that means.  See, e.g., https://t.co/VrjSrLmdJ0.
@linmart @thegarance compare with this HHS note, ht @adikamdar : https://t.co/VrjSrLmdJ0
@benadida note says: "4. Usually, doctors‚Äô letters released publicly do not include email addresses, in order to avoid HIPAA violations."
@SeanFlaim @thegarance (which was otherwise a powerful pushback on a bizarre doctor's note!)
@SeanFlaim @thegarance could be to avoid using the formal one where patient info sent. Just seemed a strange item to include in HRC barrage.
@benadida so attenuated from having an email address on a piece of letterhead, though!
@thegarance An email address alone doesn't violate HIPAA, tho, and I'd hate for drs to be more remote. (Also not in directory?)Cc @mattblaze
I don't get point 4 about HIPAA. What patient privacy problem for dr to include his own email address in letterhead? https://t.co/vpkH1kZWIP
@chrishiggins Thanks! Probably a venerable videoconference unit's standby light. Fitting if not intentional?

@jordne Could be: the scope of "unfair and deceptive trade practice" is protean. 0th step is to simply know what the company's policy is.
@jordne We shouldn't be left to hunches! Policy should be known.
@erikbryn Possible. I've never seen that by reloading a product page. I'd love to hear from @amazon if that's the case w/@zeynep here.

@lockyear @hunterwalk Or could cause new problems as some people send squirt guns that are received as pistols ...

@joshtpm And Newt just said as much to Hannity -- that Ted was meaning to support Trump.  (Whether Newt really believes that, who knows ...)
@joshtpm And does that mean Newt's Razor too?  Was N. earnestly rather than cynically trying to say "that was actually an endorsement"?
@joshtpm @EsotericCD I really think that when RNC saw it they thought it was a de facto endorsement. Just landed differently in the arena.
@EsotericCD @joshtpm suggests RNC had a copy of the text https://t.co/ZpBWQcjbaH. A la Newt's opener, did they take it as proto-endorsement?

@dick_nixon @JamieRoss7 Scotland can't veto. The cited report is making a different point about the complexities of shedding EU-sourced law.
@GreatDismal I think ppl are misreading what the report means -- tough to disentangle EU law from domestic law. But not a license to veto.
@RichardKay80 @MichaelPlaxton @dylanmatt not exact! But wasn't the parliamentary report simply discussing integration of EU + domestic law?
@RichardKay80 @MichaelPlaxton @dylanmatt not so sure. I think of it like Ecuador adopting the USD as official currency -- USA doesn't mind
@JenaFriedman @NicolaSturgeon Tales of Scots' veto are from misreading of parliamentary report, sadly. But room for bargaining after denial!
@mikedavie @dylanmatt @ezraklein Right, accounts like that are mistakenly reading more into the parliamentary report than was meant.
Scotland doesn't have a veto on Brexit. Report was merely talking abt changing EU-influenced Scottish law @dylanmatt https://t.co/WT5zcBEnXq
@JenaFriedman Or even simply ignored, but for big political risks. I could see a negotiated deal that's then put up for a second referendum.

@azeem @ramonsang just be careful that doesn't prove too much. If always political, than any slanting is OK.
@Jehochman right. But if a platform that aggregates them all and has overwhelming market share slants among them -- that's different
@Jehochman I think spiking people's news feeds on a generic platform to change their views is v. different from newspaper editorializing.
@mrgunn I'd rather have hypocrisy than nothing. Hypocrisy is a starting point for calling ppl to account, esp. if regulators won't.

@dangillmor you mean google groups?  :)
@dangillmor yeah, it got me to try storify for the first time!
@neurodruid @drvox Key escrow etc. create bad risks. But of course Alice still needs to write to Bob! Bob +only Bob "breaks" A's encryption.
Some interesting Qs from @drvox on gov't's brief on encryption. I took a stab at a reply, even as a skeptic myself: https://t.co/QZrULpdjPR
@drvox Oops.  OK, I tried to Storify both your thread and my reply at https://t.co/QZrULpdjPR.
@neurodruid @drvox CALEA for better or worse was pretty much exactly that for the legacy telephone network.
@drvox 15/ My first numbered tweetstorm reply thread. Hope I did it right. (Should I have been replying to myself after the first?)
@drvox 14/ The @berkmancenter report on the issue, https://t.co/CGUVhL5dkz. &gt; security defeats some warrants, but &gt;&gt; vectors for intel.
@drvox 13/ Some references that expand on this: an essay about British PM's proposal for back doors -- https://t.co/gq1ULt4gcS
@drvox 12/ And, whatever the merits, the tech ecosystem is no longer AT&amp;T and friends. How could app developers all have to run compliance?
@drvox 11/ But it's of course more messy. iPhone empowers ppl, but also traps way more of their data to be examined later than ever b4.
@drvox 10/ existing channels open to surveillance were "going dark." So now what they want are means to re-open it and restore status quo.
@drvox 9/ Now that status quo has changed. Mainstreaming of Internet ca. 2000 coincided with 9/11/01. And gov't ready to freak that ...
@drvox 8/ Also, the new tech was from big, stable companies like monopoly AT&amp;T for telephones. Easy to establish rel w/gov't for wiretaps.
@drvox 7/ ...surprising departure from norm of warrentless surveillance that had evolved with the tech.
@drvox 6/ Or public phone booths permitted calls for people who didn't have their own phones. When Katz was decided in the 60s, it was a ...
@drvox 5/ Part of that is because, I think, that tech evolved without much privacy. Phone lines used to be shared among multiple customers!
@drvox 4/ Those broader forms of communications made possible by modern tech also happened to evolve with means of lawful wiretapping.
@drvox 3/ Gov't's point is that chatting in a corner is one thing; talking by phone or otherwise coordinating at a distance is another.
@drvox 2/ Your powerful point is that gov't reasoning suggests no more private spaces, when we have plenty now.
@drvox 1/ V. sympathetic to your pts. Will try to explain gov't position nonetheless. Your argument and the gov't's rest on status quo ...

@jacklgoldsmith True - I'd include US (c) takedowns high on that list, and they've been (uncontroversially?) global from the start.

@jimgreer @podehaye you can guess my answer, which is consistent w French restrictions not applying automatically in US
@podehaye I don't think this answers the Q of whether Google must heed EU edicts in the U.S., to non-EU visitors. + Unconst if a US law.
@murakamiwood @davemustgo because one country typically doesn't get to say what happens on the soil of another country.
.@jacklgoldsmith Don't think so! France decision said Yahoo could geo-restrict elisions to only French citizens. https://t.co/Xmw7LTOdkO

@RichardRubinDC @PaulPage @tmikaelsen Fair enough. Heading writing seems even more lossy compression than tweeting.
@PaulPage @RichardRubinDC @tmikaelsen Right, my Q was a way of asking about RR's semantics of cuts and increases measured only by revenue.
@RichardRubinDC @tmikaelsen Thx. It does seem econ would benefit from addt'l vocabulary if a constant tax can end up a tax hike (or cut)!
@tmikaelsen Yes -- @RichardRubinDC, isn't this misphrasing, then? Would also mean a constant rate could be a "tax increase" if more volume.
@tmikaelsen @RichardRubinDC @WSJ that seems a ... confusing ... way to characterize something, then.
@RichardRubinDC @tmikaelsen @WSJ So if supply side theory worked, would that mean tax cuts were also tax increases?
@rlaattorney @HannahKonnn Mice the world over can rejoice. It'd be good to save the headline until after they try it on humans!

@pmarca so Pulitzer gets to direct his money in the public good as he likes. Even the home of Pravda adopted charitable deduction in 2011.
@pmarca Even a direct one, so long as genuine public benefit. Bonus: when crowd donates to a public cause, it offsets donors' taxes!
@pmarca @philmyth hence "if true"! We could fill in a hypothetical fire/police crowdfunding Q to bypass any breathless Pravda problem.

@Ailish_Campbell Great to spend time with you and the rest of the YGL cohort today.  Hope to stay in touch.
@shady_side Thanks! Very excited about the project.
@ewout I agree that a Patriot-missile-battery approach to bad speech is worrisome.
Thoughtful piece from @amandahess on why universities shouldn't be pressured to restrict YikYak https://t.co/Ztzi3OpYQx
@lynntaliento Thanks! Very, very excited about the project and its possibilities.
@BiIIDutton @oiioxford @msulibraries @berkmancenter Thank you very much! Amazing teams came together to bring it to this milestone.
@tjbliss @nikwoodsreed @lewis_daniel @Harvard Thank you!  We are very, very excited about linking it up to the #OER https://t.co/BA4WVTaYax
@stevemidgley @dweinberger @hlslib @harvardlil working on it!
@carlmalamud For the corpus or subset, once the exclusive period is over, researchers with prior access would be free to release it too.
@carlmalamud Ah, now I get it. Yes, the prohibitions wouldn't amount to limits greater than those of the general public. Limited duration.
@carlmalamud Sorry, don't understand the Q?
@Jago_Kosolosky @doctorow thanks!!
@navybook @abziegler @hlslib @carlmalamud @starkness here's a summary https://t.co/KlpL1dCeYz
@carlmalamud @abziegler @hlslib Thank you!  We are standing on your shoulders.
@carlmalamud @sarahjeong Through negotiations with Ravel. For my part, I knew it would likely take that long to raise the funding elsewhere.
@carlmalamud @sarahjeong Bulk access to researchers immediately (but not free to pass corpus onward); full bulk release in 8 years.
I am so proud of @HLSlib for bringing this amazing project to launch; w/props to @Ravellaw for making it possible! https://t.co/VYeO7gsFdB
@AllisonNECN Cathy Horn at Berklee!
@jmreagle Is the remedy they want for schools to be compelled by the Dept. of Education to disable YikYak via DPI? Or something else?

@GrokSurf if so they'd have to recall the cars. But I haven't seen any indication that's the case.
@anotherday____ Everything I've seen is that the cars clearly behave differently when detecting an emissions test.
@zittrain I mean, part of state inspection for an affected VW car could be to present a certificate that it's been fixed.
How could it be, with VW trickery known, there's no way to redesign an emissions test the car will (rightly) flunk? http://t.co/KqU6IAFaOq

@VolokhC If that semantic difference amounts to discrimination (if...), Clerk Davis's remedy seems diff. from other accommodations. (2/2)
@VolokhC Yes, but then those are different licenses for the celebrants -- a la civil union vs. marriage, a semantic difference only (1/2)
@VolokhC Changing the contents of a universal license seems different to me than changing the requirements of a petitioner's job.
@VolokhC Great analysis. But can an accommodation take the form of judicially changing the statutory requirements for what a license says?
@Austan_Goolsbee thank you! A delight toasting and debating w you
@Ange1oC @EFF True. I think people's ideas are independent of what they wear.

@yminsky And the worst of both worlds: "Chrysler‚Äôs patch must be manually implemented via a USB stick or by a dealership mechanic"
@yminsky I suspect that it started as an entertainment feature that then crept to include other elements with no forest-level review.

@michaelfertik Yes, I'm grateful for the advance galleys -- enjoyed reading it very much.
Looking forward to debating @ericaposner and @paulnemitz with @mcandrew on the "right to be forgotten" http://t.co/HwvuwYRiuW
@dliebelson Hi - is there an alternative link? Twitter gives a malware warning about the one you shared.
@GuptaGankur249 cool -- pls email a2jz -at- http://t.co/BBFq5Yt03W
@MichaelBerner @cspan You're very kind -- glad you liked it!

@RussellProf Thanks for the illuminating piece in IEEE Spectrum. Perhaps OSI gave TCP/IP cover to develop while stakeholders were distracted
I talked to Big Bang Theory writer Eric Kaplan about his new book, Does Santa Exist? Audio here: http://t.co/9H3P2Ddvnl
@ericlinuskaplan "do you own a house? No, I own two."
@ericlinuskaplan touche. Q involving &lt; baseline two eyes perhaps implies "only"; Q above baseline zero murders "at least"?
@ericlinuskaplan but then I'd be telling him that he'd perjure himself to answer People's Q no if A is 3. Prob should be on Team DA?
@ericlinuskaplan if you have three cookies you've already had two cookies

@jdgalarneau like.
Odd that it would be sweeter revenge to involuntarily connect up North Korea rather than DDoS it.
@PamelaSamuelson @CenDemTech @BCLTatBoalt Great pick!
@brittiowa @ajjaffe it's especially weird since there's no "plussed" to be "non" ...
@ajjaffe "nonplussed" -- I always knew this as "baffled to the point of speechlessness" rather than upset or indifferent

@erikbryn my piece on this is at http://t.co/CvJOXcXBjw, linking to @jackbalkin's http://t.co/t2aQRGwuOx
@erikbryn My (inspired by @jackbalkin's) thought is having the companies themselves be the fiduciaries; not to have new third parties do it
@Millsatwork I do, fondly! Can't understand why so many physicists losing sleep over AI gone wild, BTW.
@demandprogress @haighcg True!
@jmreagle Thanks!
@BerkeleyBrett @HillaryClinton @billclinton Good summary at http://t.co/ofG6E2fnD2. I think OK; esp. if he were House Speaker and VP vacant

@NewsBlur Thanks for the update.  What's an IP address we can use for direct access without having to go through DNS?
@nathenson TiVo is your friend :)
@edielush It could be anywhere!
