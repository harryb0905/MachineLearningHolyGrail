My brothers @MarkTremonti @Scott_Phillips @brianamarshall &amp; @IIEROCKII came to tonight's show in Orlando. Meant the world to me:)
The super moon looks pretty amazing. Reminds me of my childhood when my grandma, brother &amp; I used to stargaze. Those were good times.
It's nerd city on the tour bus. Everyone is either reading or playing Trivial Pursuit. We know how to party:)
Sitting in the back lounge of a tour bus. It's good to be back on the road.
Awesome day hanging with my friends at the PRS guitar factory. Picked up a Mira with P-90s for the upcoming tour...sounds amazing:)
@EddieTrunk @todddammitkerns great idea:)
@casey22rolltide @EddieTrunk I agree!
Just did an interview with @EddieTrunk on Q104.3 NYC. It's always a pleasure to talk with someone who is so passionate about music.
Golden Gods Awards was great. Very cool to be a part of it. Best part of an event like this is getting to hang w/ other artists you respect.
Great fun performing on Jimmy Kimmel tonight. It was cool to hear folks in the crowd singing along to the new single.

Had an awesome night hanging with my old friend Ian Thornley @bigwreckmusic and his family in Toronto.
Heading to Toronto early in the morning. First gig back with Slash &amp; the Conspirators on Friday. Hope I remember the lyrics! Goodnight
In a car listening to the Apocalyptic Love master with the guys. Really happy with how it turned out. Can't wait to share this with y'all!

One of my faves! RT @wrock79 @MylesKennedy pls have a look at my first Tattoo, dedicated to you guys from @alterbridge http://t.co/AzOilsJj
Just finished in Perth. Soundwave has been one of the best festival experiences ever. Thanks Australia.
Sad to hear Ronnie Montrose passed away. Rock Candy was one of the first songs I ever learned.
On a plane heading to Australia .....Soundwave here we come!!!!
For the finale all of the performers joined Steve Wonder to sing Happy Birthday to the Champ http://t.co/D41C0NGX
Performed Wild Horses with Slash and Haley Reinhart. So many artists and boxers I grew up admiring were in attendance.
Had so much fun performing at the Power Of Love Gala celebrating Muhammad Ali's 70th birthday last night. An experience I won't forget:)
Flying home! Hard to fathom that we're done tracking this record. Great experience. Everyone involved did a fantastic job.
Tonight's celebratory end of record dinner consisted of chicken, waffles & grits. I'm feeling a little guilty right now but it was worth it.
Played the entire record today and shot it in @MATIvision. Really excited to see how it turns out. Looks like a cool interactive experience.
No Super Bowl party for me. Spent the afternoon tracking the last vocal for the record with Slash & co. Definitely a great day.
@todddammitkerns has been cutting backing vocals in the studio for the last couple of days. He is killing it!  What a talent.
Finished my guitars on the Slash record today. 4 more songs left to sing. Getting close!!
@ClintElowery can't wait to hear it!!!!
Tracked a vocal for one of our favorite tunes tonight. Feeling good right now.
Only a few things in my life are as frustrating as a song that eludes me. Once captured...it's the most gratifying feeling in the world.
@MarkTremonti thanks buddy...Good luck working on the new Creed record!
Great photo shoot today. Winding down by listening to the Bee Gees. I might even start dancing. Definitely a sign the apocalypse is near.
Sorry I've been MIA...working on this record w/ Slash and the guys has been all consuming. We are on the home stretch!
Watching a documentary about how Paul Simon wrote Bridge Over Troubled Water...brilliant.
....I figured these moments were both too good not to share:) I hope you are all enjoying your Holidays as much as I am.
My 2 year old niece brought this to my attention on Christmas morning "Boys have a penis girls have a butt." She is a very wise young lady.
On Christmas eve my Mother in Law said "I have a beautiful breast for you." She was referring to Turkey...it got my attention nonetheless.
The song Fairy just dropped a song in my lap.....thanks song Fairy:)
Los Angeles time...11:37 p.m. Recording with Slash, Todd and Brent officially resumes...now!
Spent the evening working on my rhythm guitar parts with producer Eric Valentine. His attention to detail is amazing. Now...sleep!
@MissScabbia hey!!! Same to you...hope all is well.
Back in Hollywood with Slash and the dudes. Great first day back in the studio.
@MylesLatin_fans I just watched the Birthday Video....wow! Made my day:) Means so much to me...thank you!!!!!!!!
Wembley Arena...DVD shoot...perfect crowd. AB will never forget tonight. Thank you London.
@ELVISLIBERACE thanks buddy!!
Overwhelmed by all the birthday tweets and posts...you guys rule! Thank you.
Still giddy from the gig last evening in Manchester. The crowd was spectacular.
Hope everyone is having a great Thanksgiving back in the States!
Tonight we embark on our 1st string of dates headlining arenas here in the UK. This is an incredibly special time for AB....we are grateful.
The Vienna crowd was off the hook! What a great night. Going to chill here for the next 3 days before hitting the UK.
Last few days in Germany were fantastic! Vienna tomorrow...can't wait!
I didn't realize how great the lyrics to Glen Cambell's "Rhinestone Cowboy" were until just now.
Sitting in the dressing room torturing my band mates with soft rock of the 70's...BRUTAL!!!!
With that said....Gothenburg saved my ass tonight. Great crowd...loud singers.
Why is it that I always catch a cold in Scandinavia? I love it here but my immune system seems to take a vacation every time we arrive:(
Eindhoven ruled!!!! RT @Dennisondrums @MylesKennedy How about yesterday in Eindhoven?
I had a blast with the Brussels crowd tonight. Felt like a big party. I was a complete goofball but it was fun.
@EddieTrunk thanks man:)
@glenn_hughes you deserve a win...BCC2 is such a brilliant record! Have a safe trip.
@AlterBridgeFR  Done! thank you for the support!!!
So much fun! RT @gillesepie @lizzynottoli @myleskennedy last night @citrusetoile for my BDay  http://t.co/hHwQqeJZ
I just had the most amazing evening in Paris. Life really is good right now.
@Stixzadinia uhgg! Looks like we will just miss each other. Hopefully I'll catch y'all soon!
@Stixzadinia towards the end of the month. How long will you be around?
@Stixzadinia will do brother:)
This record is so good! I think it gave my ears an STD:) @Stixzadinia  #BallsOut  by @Steel_Panther is available on iTunes now!!!!!
Last night we had a blast playing Lyon France. Beautiful town. Tonight....Fribourg Switzerland.
Getting ready to play Dortmund Germany. Rockpalast filming the show tonight!!!!
Thanks Italy!! We had a great time with y'all. Off to Germany.
The crowds in Milan & Zurich were outstanding. My jet lag...not so outstanding. Hoping I finally sleep more than 3 hours tonight.
@TheBrentSmith thanks for the kind words:) I was cranking Diamond Eyes earlier today on my ipod. Love that song!
Touched down in Zurich today. AB European/UK tour starts tomorrow!
Next week...AB returns to rock Europe! Mark and I were just discussing which songs to add to the set. Should be a cool tour.
Returned home today from a productive month of preproduction & recording with Slash, Brent and Todd. Back to Cali in December to finish:)
Just finished the first vocal. It's wild singing straight to tape again. Gotta nail each take because protools fixes are not an option.
@tonyharnell thanks brother. Hope all is well back in NYC!
@brucekulick thanks man!!! All the best to you as well.
Things are really coming together here in the studio. Sounds great! I start tracking vocals this evening.
Just watched U2's "One" video. Reminiscing about seeing the Zoo TV tour back in '92 . One of my favorite concert experiences.
@ELVISLIBERACE Thanks buddy:) I appreciate that!
Big fat wooly analogue recording about to commence.... :)
@morj1979 amazing!!!! I am so excited. You are mega talented. Thank you:)
Well into week 3 of preproduction with Slash, Todd & Brent. We start tracking a few tunes this weekend. Should be fun!
Just finished lyrics to a tune that I've chased for months. Some songs take half an hour...some take half a year. You never know.
@PerlaFHudson thanks! Hope you kicked ass tonight. See y'all soon.
@gillesepie hopefully when we come to Paris. Would love to see you both!!
On this night exactly 10 years ago I met my wife. Best thing that ever happened to me.
Today's highlight was watching Cheap Trick rehearse a couple of tunes. They always sound perfect.
Arrived back in L.A. today to continue preproduction with Slash, Brent and Todd for the upcoming record. So many songs in the works!
Carnival Of Madness wrapped up this weekend. Looking forward to getting home in a few hours. Day off tomorrow!
We are all sitting on the bus watching When Harry Met Sally. What happened to this band?
Day off in Nashville. Walking around and hearing all the incredible musicians downtown blows my mind. Crazy talent around these parts.
@DAVIDMDRAIMAN @AfterbyrneA7X @clintelowery @coreytaylorrock .....True.
....tonight was no exception. My knack for embarrassing myself in between songs really is special:)
I interacted with the audience a little more tonight. That usually means that I attempt to say something funny and fall on my face...
....It is definitely more fun...At least for me it is:)
Writing a record can be overwhelming. It's like combining every high school and college term paper into one...
@brianamarshall sorry buddy....I couldn't resist:)
@Stixzadinia LOL! Yeah...you might have me on that one:) Hope you are well brother.
Reminded me of how many incredible musical experiences I had back in my Jazz & Fusion days. Grateful for those memories.
Set my ipod to shuffle and Third Wind by Pat Metheny came on. I always used to listen to this track before gigs...such a brilliant solo!
Should the Pilots, Equestrians and Rock Fans converge later tonight...things could get crazy.
Playing Rock Stock Festival today in Iowa. 100 yards away is a Horse Show and a few thousand feet above is an air show.
....oops I meant Kool Aid...I can't spell tonight:/
Louisville Kentucky was awesome. Great crowd and a beautiful city! They even had fried cool-aid at the fair...explain that one.
Getting ready to do Rockline in a few minutes for the Carnival of Madness.
Great AB gig tonight! Also had a productive day working on tunes for the record I'm doing with Slash. Now I'll celebrate by going to bed:)
@alisiaamourlas Yes it does...
@BaselAnabtawi Slash
@AndersDriftwood very true!
Spent the last six hours trying to come up with a chorus lyric. Writing can be such a bitch....Especially when inspiration eludes you.
Long day of travel that included weather delays had me wondering if I'd make it to tonight's AB gig. Just arrived with 90 minutes to spare:)
@ELVISLIBERACE I am sure I will! Miss you as well my friend.
@IIEROCKII Can't wait to hear what you and Mark have got cooking!
@ClintElowery Thanks buddy! Hope to see you out there soon.
First full day back home since May. Couldn't have asked for better weather in Spokane. Enjoying some family time. Should be a good week.
@gillesepie I wish you were with us as well! Sure could go for some of your special potatoes right now:)
Just had a productive week with Slash, Todd and Brent working on tunes for the new record. Now I am going home!!!!!
Great first day of preproduction with Slash and the guys. Jet lag was no match for caffeine and a little rock & roll.
Back on another plane after 15 hours traveling from Europe. Homestretch to LA!!!!
Just touched down in the good 'ole USA. Good flight except for the strange bug I found in my laptop bag. At least it wasn't a scorpion.
Still buzzing after last night's gig in Belgrade. Going to bed now....long day of flying tomorrow to get back to the States:)
WOW! RT @missyvi75 @MylesKennedy Hey Myles, the tattoo is completed. I hope the blackbird will find its way...  http://twitpic.com/5zhcm4
Congratulations my Wife's parents as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary today!
Last 2 nights in Rome and Milan were epic. Looking forward to returning in October!
Had a great night hanging with good friends in Milan. Gonna try and get some rest now. Hoping to have a productive day tomorrow.
@MarkTremonti That might be the greatest song I have ever heard:) Kidding....
Last night's DVD shoot with Slash and the gang went well. Couldn't have asked for a better audience. Stoke rules!!!!
Wow! Very impressed. RT @AlasdairParr @MylesKennedy Not sure if you've seen this yet.. but this cover is phenomenal! http://t.co/hQbUd1h
It's just my opinion but Amy Winehouse was a very rare talent. So many songs left unsung. Heartbreaking news.
@PerlaFHudson Funny:)
Watching Judas Priest at High Voltage at the moment....school is now in session!
Pretty excited about playing the High Voltage Festival tomorrow in London! Too excited..sleeping tonight is going to be a challenge.
In a Cab driving through London...great people watching. Lots of energy on the streets tonight.
@hellinhighheels I love the Pug Head tilt!!!!!!
Really felt the love from Manchester tonight. Great to be back for sure!!!
Wow!!! That is hardcore...love it. RT @missyvi75 @MylesKennedy http://t.co/Fu2mD8n
@gillesepie I love that shot:) It was so great seeing you both. Hopefully we will see you again soon!!!!
Great job man!!! You nailed it. RT @CarlPavon I wish @MylesKennedy could check my wonderful life cover. http://t.co/ihxRv23
Watching Elivis sing "If I can dream" and realizing just how much our (AB) producer @ELVISLIBERACE looks like him...FREAKY!
@Tourmangler an Irish Pub in Madrid...hmmm sounds interesting:)
Just had my skull crushed by Gojira at Sonisphere. Very impressed...good band.
BTW....many thanks to everyone who came to the shows in Paris and Zurich this week. You made us feel so welcome...meant so much.
Walked the streets of Madrid looking for lyrical inspiration. No luck this time. Still appreciated the beauty of this city at night.
They blew up an unattended suitcase at the airport today. Now my ears are ringing even louder than they usually do...crazy loud!
Really diverse line up of artists at both festivals we played in Scotland and Ireland this weekend. Had a blast!
@MarkTremonti thanks dude:)
@NotthefakeBrett Yes....I am. The beret says "Clark W Griswald." I hope all is well man!
@MarkTremonti thanks buddy:) miss you guys. Have fun at the Birthday Party!!!
....with that said...I can't think of a better place to be stranded.
To my Italian friends who tried to warn me about the trains here in Italy... you were right...we are stranded yet again:(
Nice relaxing boat trip off the coast of Italy. Unfortunately a 10 year old boy is at the helm. Now...not so relaxing:/
On the train leaving Venice. Beautiful city! Enjoying a few days off in Italy before starting with Slash and the guys next week.
RT @NessaShaddow @MylesKennedy do you have a real FB account?  http://www.facebook.com/pages/Myles-Kennedy/140514345999992?sk=info
Thanks..this is a fake FB account. RT @Crimsonvamp7 @MylesKennedy  @alterbridge   This guy is saying he's you!!! http://t.co/2yOpQlQ
OMG...Gelato is so much better than ice cream. I can't believe it took me so long to figure this out:)
Chilling in my room listening to the new Bon Iver. Been waiting for this record for a while. Justin Vernon's voice is beautifully haunting
Tonight's gig in Florence was crazy hot!! At least a 110 degrees in the venue. Thanks to everyone for sticking it out with us.
Lucky enough to have a day off in Montpellier for France's annual Music Day. So much great music and food. Found my happy place today:)
Last few days in Barcelona were beautiful and tonight's show was fun as well. BTW....Happy Father's Day to all you Dads out there!
@GWDrums me too!!!
@JeffreyRouse enjoy Paris! Give everyone my best.
Iggy and the Stooges were brilliant! Fun House...Raw Power...Yes! The Cult were great as well. Billy Duffy is such a killer guitarist.
@JeffreyRouse hey man!!! Wish y'all were here today...hope all is well out there!
The Hellfest gig in France was cool today. Getting ready to go hear Iggy Pop play in a few minutes...beyond excited to say the least.
@ClintElowery funny!!!
@JDurbinAI10 Wow!!! Thanks for the kind words. Your pipes are amazing and your story is so inspiring. Yeah...would love to chat as well!
Loved playing Luxembourg...people are always so polite here! Off to Hellfest in France.
Bummed I didn't get to hear the entire Mot√∂rhead set since we played at the same time. Hopefully we'll be on another festival w/ them soon.
Just stood sidestage after our gig at Nova Rock and watched the mighty Iron Maiden. Bruce Dickinson sounded amazing...what a frontman!
Found a fantastic outdoor cafe in Vienna. Today is starting off great. Recharging before I head back to the hotel to write.
Just watched Def Leppard. They sounded great...so many hits!
Download is like the Super Bowl of festivals...incredible. UK fans are so good to us!! Wish my Wife was here to share the day with me.
On the way to play the Download Festival. Jamming Unleashed In The East by Judas Priest. Rob Halford.....Metal God.
Kind of ironic.... a singer with a fear of public speaking:)
Mark and I presented tonight at the Kerrang Awards in London. I choked like I did at my 5th grade spelling bee.
@TheBrentSmith thanks for going easy on me!
@CHRIS_Daughtry thanks...I'm getting clobbered on this one:)
@realdonjamieson I'll leave the comedy to you:) hope all is well!
@Stixzadinia thanks buddy. Can't wait to check out the record!! Hearing great things. See you in Australia.
@Stixzadinia Hamburg...how bout you?
@Stixzadinia I can't say i didn't expect a response from you on that one...very funny:)
Ok...I realize that last sentence didn't sound very good. I'm a dork. Let the teasing begin!!!
Jonesing for fresh veggies as we tour Germany. Unfortunately this E.Coli outbreak has got me freaked out. I'm having dreams about cucumbers.
@EddieTrunk thanks!!
What the venue looks like...RT @MarkTremonti http://img.ly/4OoK Here's another shot of the entrance.
Very cool!! RT @glenn_hughes BCC ~ Man In The Middle ~ http://youtu.be/3WHO7-uHjeo?hd=1 ~ Tour starts this week! http://bit.ly/mepwlQ
Just played an old fortress called Spandau Citadel. Built in Berlin around the 1500's. Never played a venue with a draw bridge. pretty cool!
@EddieTrunk happy to hear you were rocking AB as you hit the cardio:) Even happier to hear Blue Murder was in the mix!
Seriously...from the audience, facilities, food and other bands on the bill...this has been like rock and roll summer camp. Loved it.
I forgot how fun festivals could be until we played Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park this weekend. Germany knows how to throw a party for sure.
Brent is great! RT @DillonDouglas I would give both my arms and a leg to hear @MylesKennedy and @TheBrentSmith together on a song
We were told that crowds in Poland were great. That is an understatement. Unbelievably good energy tonight:)
Back on the road kids. On my way to Warsaw. Had a great week with the family. Short but sweet.
@DoubleL4 I am actually a cartoon character in real life:) I play a human on stage.
RT @jerryhorton What's your dream car? A 1978 AMC Pacer...with a lift kit:)
I just saw a super deluxe mullet at the Denver Airport! Thank you mullet guy...your haircut just brought great joy to my day.
Met Sebastian Bach today at the festival in Columbus...really cool guy. We also ran into all our buddies from other bands. Good day.
I mean...the production value it would have added to the show would have been HUGE!!!!
Though I'm grateful the world didn't end at 6pm during our ROTR set..I can't help but wonder how it might have improved our live set.
Every time I see Saving Private Ryan it reminds me of just how much has been sacrificed by so many. Everyday should be Veterans Day.
NYC. Great town, great food, great venue, great crowd...What else could one ask for? Now it's sleepy time.
I ate so many bagels earlier today that now my belly looks like it's carrying a giant carb baby.
Waking up in New York City is a great way to start the day. Now I must find a bagel.
Fortunately the Worcester crowd was beyond cool tonight and helped get me back on track:)
I managed to not only sing the wrong lyric tonight..but the melody from a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SONG!! WTF is my problem? Losing my marbles:/
@morgan7d I know...I've been pretty amazed at the response! I'm totally down with the idea.
@grahamelesh Thanks for the tip on the new Bon Iver tune. The Blood Bank EP ruled my world when I first heard it.
@morgan7d that is a great idea!!!!! Let's talk.
@morgan7d lucky!! Great seeing you as well brother:) You killed it tonight as usual.
Spent the last 2 1/2 hours watching Gangs of New York. Bus lost satellite signal for last 15 minutes of film. No clue how it ended. Ugh!!
@ClintElowery you guys were incredible. Looking forward to meeting the rest of your family one day:)
AB going on after Sevendust today in KC...gonna have to up our game. Set will consist of magic tricks and interpretive dance by Tremonti.
Allergies are kicking hard today. Woke up with a puffy face....small children are frightened of me. It really looks weird:)
Stoked to play Nashville tonight. Considered moving here after we recorded Blackbird here in '07. Great place for a musician to call home.
@kitkat0917 Soul Shine is one of my favorite songs ever. @BethHart is an amazing singer.
Word!RT @ClintElowery @MylesKennedy yes!!! Warren Hanyes is out of this world. Soulful cat!!!! I wish I had the talent he has in his pinkie.
Got up bright and early to purchase the new Warren Haynes solo record. Love it! Beyond my grasp how one man can be so talented.
Really excited to be back on Rockline! Show starts tonight at 11:30 EST. 1-800-344-ROCK (7625) http://www.rocklineradio.com/
I can't believe I just stuffed my face with Waffle House at 2 am. Not the smartest move on my part. Oh well...got to live a little right?
After 6 weeks and 7.2 million votes we found out that our fans won the Fuse TV battle of (rock) fans. Incredible! So proud of all of you.
Screw it...I'm just going to admit I'm a massive 70's FM mellow rock fan. There I said it. I feel much better now.
Had a blast playing last 2 nights in Chicago.  Now we're jamming to Little River Band on the bus. Oops...prolly should keep that 2 myself:)
RT @Stigmatyr @MylesKennedy  Of course we do Earthling!
Day off...should be writing and demoing but somehow I just got sucked into one of those UFO shows. I wonder if Aliens like rock & roll too:)
@MarkTremonti played me some of the demos for his solo record today. Killer stuff!!! You are gonna love it.
I totally agree!! RT @IAmJericho You can add Motorhead to  the list of bands that MUST be in the rock n roll Hall Of Fame!!
@NotthefakeBrett really great to hear from you brother!!! Hope our paths cross soon.
Good folks in Salt Lake. They remembered the lyrics way better than me. After a year on the road my brain is turning to mush.
Mark and I are on our way to be tonight's guests on Loveline with Mike & Dr. Drew. Good times!
@Stixzadinia I'm sure HOB is grateful I didn't make it last night. The idea of me streaking drunk through Hollywood is beyond frightening:)
@TheBrentSmith thanks buddy. Coming from you that means a lot. Trust me...I am a horrible drummer:)
Played the Kimmel show tonight. Our thanks to the AB folks who stopped by and showed their support.
Tonight AB played San Francisco for the first time. Killer crowd. Tomorrow...Jimmy Kimmel Live.
@gillesepie can't wait to see you and @lizzynottoli as well!! @CitrusEtoile my favorite restaurant in the world!!!!
Just went to see Steel Panther....my face hurts from laughing so hard:) Hysterical!!! Great musicians as well.
Picked up "Words That Sing Well" by my friend @Clintelowery on iTunes. Grateful for the beauty he brings to the world with his songs.
On my way to Portland to kick off this AB tour.
Today we rehearsed for the upcoming Alter Bridge tour. Tomorrow we are gonna try a few tunes we haven't played live yet.
Productive day working on demos yesterday. At it again early this morning so I can hang with the family later this afternoon.
After 23 hours and 4 flights I made it home. Gonna power down for a few days before starting with AB again next week.
I got to meet so many cool people over the last few months on this tour. An incredibly rewarding experience to say the least.
Wrapped up the tour of South America and Mexico with Slash and the gang last evening in Argentina. Feels like the last day of summercamp.
Thanks for the good time Brazil! Gonna miss all of you for sure...wonderful people. On our way to Argentina.
Getting ready to warm up for our gig in Sao Paulo Brazil tonight. If the crowd is anything like last night's in Rio I'll be a happy camper.
I'm completely deaf from the crowd in Santiago Chile. Our sound engineer had a tough time getting us above 'em. Intense evening.
Just arrived in Chile. They were actually blasting Alter Bridge at immigration. Any fears of a rubber glove interrogation were put to rest:)
Thanks for the good time Bogota!! Off to Chile.
Pretty special gig last night in beautiful Caracas Venezuela. Felt a strong connection with the audience. Really great vibes all around.
The Mexico City crowds have been spectacular for the last 3 nights. I love my job:)
My Spanish sucks.  During a part of tonight's gig my stage banter consisted of a combo of French and Spanish. It was very strange.
The folks here in Mexico City love their Rock & Roll. It's good to finally get to play here.
Just landed in Mexico City after a day off in LA. Back to work!!!!
Getting ready to fly from Hong Kong back to the States. 12 hours to knock out some lyrics and sleep (hopefully). Sad the Asia tour is over:(
Ventured out of the hotel room today to check out the Korean Demilitarized Zone with the gang. Fascinating stuff.
I want to convey to everyone here in Japan that you will continue to be in my thoughts. I admire how you are all dealing with this.
So sad we had to postpone the rest of our Japan dates. Breaks my heart to see what is happening over here.
Grateful to Osaka for letting us share some music this evening. Hope it helped bring a little solace during these tough times.
I appreciate those who've expressed thoughts regarding our safety. I assure you we're taking necessary precautions to stay out of harms way.
We are in Osaka Japan tonight. It's hard to fathom all that this country has endured over the last couple days.
On the way to Bangkok...really excited about this one:)
Note to self...do not watch air crash investigation shows the night before flying.
I dig touring this part of the world but my voice doesn't take to the constant flying. Definitely makes my pipes do some strange things.
Sorry I've been MIA lately. Been down in Australia playing the Soundwave Festival w/ Slash. Oz has definitely been good to us.
Really happy to be back in Australia. I got to meet a Wombat! Goofy little creature. Gonna meet some more furry friends tomorrow at the Zoo.
On the plane....let the rock & roll circus begin!!!!
@ClintElowery actually I'll be giving the safety demonstration as well as serving refreshments on tomorrow's flight:) see you soon!
Last night of the tour with Ozzy. Great experience...I learned a lot. Tomorrow we head to Australia!!!
Almost just got run over at a crosswalk in Florida. Glad I walk as defensively as I drive:) That was a close one.
Heard a preview of the new @hellodemons meet skeletons last night. @ClintELowery is such an amazing songwriter. His melodies rule!!
Productive day off. Did some writing and worked on learning one of my favorite Mississippi John Hurt tunes. Now it's sleepy time.
Why do they call it The History Channel when so much of the programming revolves around the end of the World and future catastrophe? Weird.
Just checked out the new Foo Fighters video for 'White Limo.' Love it!!!! Reminds me a little of early Queens of the Stone Age.
Getting ready to call Eddie Trunk for his radio show on Sirius 19 XM 53. Should be fun!
RT @Clijsterskim @MylesKennedy deep breathing exercises and yoga! Thanks Kim...Congratulations on your number 1 ranking!!!
Insomnia sucks. This counting sheep thing does not work. Any suggestions?
Just arrived in Denver...it was good to be home for the last 2 days.
Proud of Slash. Rocked the Superbowl. Calm, cool and collected. I would have been scared to death!!!!!
Sad to hear Gary Moore passed away. His approach as a guitarist definitely influenced my playing.
I'm totally jacked on green tea...I'm gonna be up all night!!
Tonight's Tacoma Dome gig was a personal milestone. Playing close to home for such a cool crowd did me proud. Pacific Northwest Rules!
Recently I turned my Wife onto the animated series Metalocalypse. To my surprise she loved it! That makes her pretty damn cool if u ask me.
Just watched Buffalo 66 for the umpteenth time. That movie always gets me. Vincent Gallo did a great job with that film.
Tonight's show with Ozzy got postponed. On the way to LA watching concert footage of Hendrix, Marvin Gaye and Kravitz...learning a ton.
RT @Satchel666 @MylesKennedy I had to break my after show cola habit with Jack Daniels and Smack....that is hilarious!
I've started a very unhealthy after show ritual...drinking cola. Sugar is pure evil! How can something be so unhealthy yet so enticing?
@CHRIS_Daughtry that is good to know. There's an army of us out there who have admitted in the last few hours that they feel the same way:)
I may have been the only man in America who wasn't watching football today. Sports and my attention span don't seem to mesh very well.
I love it when Eddie Trunk gets riled up during Stump the Trunk....hilarious!
Kansas City is a great rock & roll town. Always feel a good vibe from the folks here.
The Pandora app on my iPhone has been getting a ton of use lately. Discovering lots of cool music.
Enjoyed seeing the "Lemmy" film tonight. If you dig Mr. Kilmister and Mot√∂rhead I think you'll like this flick.
To everyone who helped get Isolation to #1 at rock radio in the U.S...THANK YOU!!!!!
Just played our first night on the Ozzy run. He is such a great performer and his band sounds great.
Just had an amazing time in the studio with Warren Haynes and friends. Joe Bonamassa was there as well...such a cool evening.
Just left NAMM. Total sensory overload! Heading to the studio later tonight...hopefully my pipes will hold up.
Great last couple of days rehearsing with Slash, Brent, Bobby and Todd. Trying to get my brain to recall all the lyrics..challenging!
I just found out our friend Erin Freriks @echelon122 passed away. This is heartbreaking news...such a sad day.
Amazing crowd in Houston. Billy Gibbons even stopped by! It was a nice way to end this part of the AB tour until we resume in April.
A total stranger just paid my bill at a Cracker Barrel in Texas. Definitely a random act of kindness. Whoever you are... thank you.
The media is buzzing about "golden voice" Ted Williams. This inspirational story about a man who got a 2nd chance in life just made my day.
Just performed Isolation on Jay Leno. Now we're off to play the House Of Blues. Every date on the west coast has sold out so far..thank you!
Got to play the Showbox in Seattle tonight. Brings back fond memories of playing there with Mayfield Four in the mid 90's.

Watching That Metal Show marathon today on VH1 classic...now I'll never finish Christmas shopping!
Just arrived in Spokane...it's good to be home. The Inland Northwest is so beautiful covered in snow.

Listening to Jelly Roll by Blue Murder. After over 20 years that song still rocks. ...John Sykes is fantastic.

Yet another amazing UK crowd...Manchester was so kind to us. They sang louder than me!
First night of the AB tour.. Glasgow crowd was absolutely insane!!

Winnipeg did not disappoint. Amazing audience! I bonked my head with the mic stand. I'm gonna have a nice lump on my cranium:) Such a klutz.

Hitting the road for the next 15 weeks straight. Packing for two tours in a row is definitely proving to be a big challenge. My brain hurts!
