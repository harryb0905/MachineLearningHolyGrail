On Friday I sent a 2nd letter to Gov. Lee asking that he remove the bust of  KKK Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest from the State Capitol. Honoring Forrest in the capitol, which belongs to all our citizens, is just plain wrong. The  bust needs to go. https://t.co/WiIDmn8fiv

Today @rosadelauro and I wrote a letter to XPO logistics regarding the alleged mistreatment of employees. Following the announced closure of the XPO #Memphis warehouse, we are concerned about the timing of the decision and the anticipated 400+ layoffs.  https://t.co/Wjqg3VOHsv

Nathan Bedford Forrest’s bust should be removed from the TN state capitol. I doesn’t matter if he was a “great tactician.” Being a great tactician doesn’t overcome being Grand Wizard of the KKK or the person responsible for the massacre at Fort Pillow. https://t.co/HH6B85iSgN
Proud to join colleagues calling for Sec. Acosta’s resignation. In pursuit of an unconscionable plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein he failed to notify victims. Shame on him. And how did the US attorney in Miami even become Secretary of Labor? https://t.co/FBH6Q6vGG4
Today I sent a letter to the @NBA commending the proposed change to the min. draft age, but questioning the 2022 implementation. Delaying the change for 3 years will only restrict the professional opportunities of players who would be otherwise eligible. https://t.co/ze9uukuPt4
Trump’s Title X gag-rule will effectively de-fund clinics &amp; organizations that provide reproductive health services. This shows a clear disregard for women, the LGBTQIA+ community, people of color, and low-income Americans who rely on #TitleX programs. #NoGagRule #ProtectChoice
In 2009 I wrote a letter to the NBA requesting that they remove the “19 plus one” age requirement. The #NBA has placed its business interests above the interests of young players for too long. I’m happy some progress is being made. https://t.co/mUE9skuUaC
Predominantly white sports like golf, tennis, hockey, &amp; baseball (historically white) don’t have these same requirements. There’s something wrong with keeping kids, who are likely African-American, from pursuing their chosen career &amp; earning money for their families &amp; communities
I’m glad the NBA is reconsidering the draft age. But why wait until 2022? The requirement keeps players who are #NBA ready from pursuing their careers. #KingJames, D. Howard &amp; Kobe went straight from HS, but Zion Williamson &amp; others have to risk injury. https://t.co/bgzKBvSqfX

I’m glad #MichaelCohen will be testifying before Congress. Trump told him things he wouldn’t have told anyone else, especially regarding his dealings with Russia. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/e8GXER233h
If need be, Congress can subpoena Muller and the entire report. I feel confident that Chairman @RepJerryNadler will get to the bottom of this and his committee will back him. We won’t allow justice to be stymied and covered-up by Trump’s administration. #MuellerInverstigation https://t.co/aHwvZC055w
The American public has paid for the special counsel’s report &amp; they deserve to see it. They deserve to know whether or not their president is a crook. However, I fear Trump &amp; Barr may try &amp; stop the public from seeing the report. #MuellerReport https://t.co/DAsrYIDtoT
I’ll be on @CNN at approx. 12:40 CST/1:40 EST to discuss Michael Cohen’s upcoming testimony before the House Oversight Committee and other topics relating to the #CultureOfCorruption in the Trump administration.
The President shouldn’t intimidate people from testifying before Congress. That’s what Trump attempted to do by talking about Michael Cohen’s father-in-law. As @SpeakerPelosi said, any efforts to intimidate family members or pressure witnesses will not be tolerated. #Obstuction https://t.co/vMBEMO5cJT

The deal #Democrats secured doesn’t just #KeepGovernmentOpen, it includes investments in infrastructure, protections for our environment, &amp; a long overdue pay raise for federal workers. Urge @realDonaldTrump to sign it immediately so we can avoid a second #TrumpShutdown.
@Alpha_Cunt @MSNBC William Faulkner wrote,”The past is not dead.Its not even past.” The Scopes trial over teaching of evolution was in #Tennessee about 100 years ago. Neither Faulkner nor primitive, Bible Belt thought are dead. @HRC #LGBTNews

Trump worked in showbiz long enough to know that sequels are always worse than the original. The first #TrumpShutdown was a disaster, and we don’t want another. He needs to take the threat of a shutdown off the table &amp; sign the bipartisan agreement to #KeepGovernmentOpen.
Life can be hectic &amp; unpredictable, which is why all working people need access to #PaidLeave. I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the #FAMILYAct, which would set a national paid leave policy, shift #caregiving norms, and make workplaces more equitable &amp; family friendly.

During the #TrumpShutdown FAA employees, such as air traffic controllers, were forced to work for 35 days without pay. I’m proud to cosponsor H.R. 1108, which will fund the FAA during government shutdowns. If you show up to work you should get paid. Period. #aviation

Whitaker implied he no longer thinks looking into Trump finances would be “crossing a red line.” Access to information that isn’t publicly available changed his mind. What does he know? #Collusion #CultureOfCorruption #TrumpRussia https://t.co/FCve0fi5jm
Whitaker came out of nowhere. He wasn’t in the line of succession. He has very little legal experience, but despite that was chosen to head the DOJ. That raises some serious questions, and it's hard for me to believe that Trump didn’t ask #Whitaker about the #MuellerInvestigation https://t.co/d0g224vvwB
Whitaker came into stonewall us. When #Whitaker was football player he was a tight end, which is generally  a blocker. Today he was a blocker again. He’s still in the same roll as when he was on the Iowa Hawkeyes. He was just treading water and stonewalling. #ProtectMueller https://t.co/dmZlhzQ9SK
If the Trump family owes lots of money to Russian oligarchs &amp; people close to Putin &amp; that effected the actions he took as POTUS, investigating their finances wouldn’t be crossing a red line but would be a red line directly to Moscow that we need to look into. #Whitaker #Mueller https://t.co/9EPMvxzmR2
The #MuellerInvestigation has resulted in the conviction of Paul Manafort; guilty pleas from Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, and Michael Cohen; and dozens of indictments. I don’t think that’s a #WitchHunt. #Whitaker refuses to say what he thinks. https://t.co/AJbh7ErUfQ

When we hear at the #SOTU that you can’t have peace &amp; legislation if you have war &amp; investigation, that’s deeply concerning. I hope that acting Attorney General #Whitaker will choose to cooperate at Friday’s @HouseJudiciary hearing, but, if not, we have subpoenas ready. #Justice
During the Great Depression, when we sat on the brink of financial ruin, Democrats passed the New Deal &amp; saved our country.  Today, as we face the crisis of #ClimateChange, bold action is needed once again. That’s why I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC’s #GreenNewDeal Resolution.

If the President is serious about stopping the spread of #HIV/#AIDS by 2030, I think that’s admirable. But he shouldn’t leverage this for political points if he doesn’t plan to follow through. His past actions (cuts to Medicare and Ron White) don’t inspire much confidence. #SOTU

The #EmmettTill murder &amp; the miscarriage of justice that followed are a national disgrace. I look forward to seeing true #justice done and truth brought to bear as the DOJ reopens the case in a new push for #JusticeforEmmettTill. #CivilRights https://t.co/bcVKlsGewv https://t.co/ZzuHQmMuW1
#CancelTheSummit https://t.co/3Mr2hxrSLG
Following AG #Rosenstein's announcement of #Mueller's newest #indictments against #Russian officials, I call on @realDonaldTrump to cancel his meeting w/#Putin,who has consistently lied about election interference.  They are attacking our country, Mr. President. Enough is enough.
I was a proud cosponsor of the #EmmettTill Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act, and was pleased yesterday to learn that the investigation into his abduction &amp; murder is being reopened. Let #justice prevail. #justiceforEmmettTill. #CivilRights https://t.co/d9prQvgWOz
After chaotic #NATOSummit, #Trump claims victory when his only real action was to bash #Germany&amp; give #Putin a warm embrace.
