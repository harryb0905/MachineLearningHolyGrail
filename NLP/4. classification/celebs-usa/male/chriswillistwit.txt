@PonceCityMarket such a shame that such a well designed place fails each time to provide clean smelling family bathrooms. Otherwise, great.
@united Thanks for your reply @united headed home tomorrow. Looking forward to a safe blissful peaceful trip home.  I'll be watching
@united @Me_In_Dallas part of the joy is being pushed to excel in business and excelling. No harm in demanding others rise to the challenge.
@united @Me_In_Dallas what can I say, Dianne. There are times when not getting the bare minimum on board while everyone else is, stings a little.
@united @united btw, the in flight ent rebooted and worked. Sarah on board crew member made the trip spectacular! More like her. I'll be watching
@united Yes, @united safe travels are ultimately most important. Made it A'Dam for ADE. A great time here.
@united Will let you know how it goes.
@united Will try again.
@united Yes. Immediately reached out. Was assured system would reset. Taxi time makes it difficult to bring it up again. As soon as we are airborne
@united It's the little things that make a long trip a joy. So far the crew is short on joy. Still believing.
@united Trying. Not off to a good start. I get it things happen. But how is my in flight ent the only one on board not working?
Hope @united steps up. Arrived at gate. Cold reception by agents. Strike one. On board to A-dam.In flight Ent. Not working. Strike 2. Ugh
@united Hoping flight UA70 isn't 6 hours of sub par service. The #Delta Airlines bar is high!
