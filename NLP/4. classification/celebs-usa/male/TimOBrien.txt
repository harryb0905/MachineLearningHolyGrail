4/ “Among the most explosive and potentially damning aspects of Mr. Cohen’s testimony will be providing evidence of potential criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president.”  https://t.co/sLKlJ5PHr6
3/ “The fi­nan­cial state­ments were de­vel­oped by Mr. Trump’s ac­coun­tant,” Allen Weisselberg.  https://t.co/ZwkYMXfkbg
2/  Shocking!:  “Co­hen also will make pub­lic some of Trump’s pri­vate fi­nan­cial state­ments and al­lege that Trump at times in­flated or de­flated his net worth for busi­ness and per­sonal pur­poses, in­clud­ing avoid­ing pay­ing prop­erty taxes”  https://t.co/ZwkYMXfkbg

“For over a decade, Manafort repeatedly and brazenly violated the law. His crimes continued up through the time he was first indicted in Oct. 2017 and remarkably went unabated even after indictment.”
Those Manafort duped, per the sentencing memo, included “Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government."

I was reporting from Puerto Rico a year ago — in the mountains and on the coasts — when President Trump was misrepresenting the White House’s disaster response to Maria and lowballing the loss of life. A year later, he’s still at it: https://t.co/dlI9g7Li0m
Trump retweets Lou Dobbs’ unsubstantiated claim that Maria’s death toll in Puerto Rico was inflated. It’s possible that studies *underestimated* the death count. And the exact number is beside the point for now: The relief effort was bungled and a huge loss of life followed. https://t.co/fJ71miVybu

If President Trump had learned lessons from Hurricane Maria instead of just holding a grudge, lying and dissembling, he might be better prepared for Florence - and for solving Puerto Rico’s ongoing problems. My column: https://t.co/dlI9g7Li0m
And POTUS is now debating when and how many people died after his single visit to Puerto Rico (paper towel tossing and all) rather than a constructive conversation about the nature of the relief effort. (A conversation that could usefully inform the Florence response.)
2/2...and...He didn’t oversee relief efforts with nearly the same dedication as he did in Florida and Texas. He tweeted about Steph Curry more immediately than he did Puerto Rico. And the island’s location and logistics were not insurmountable. 3000 died.

Australia's latest bout of political turmoil has a grim undertone, says @davidfickling https://t.co/hsIds4Eg9R
Manhattan DA may charge the Trump Organization “and two senior company officials in connection with Michael D. Cohen’s hush money payment to an adult film actress.” Allen Weisselberg, Trump’s CFO, was mentioned on Cohen-Trump tapes discussing payment.  https://t.co/e7Dsuq8N3y
Cohen is not Rosie O’Donnell. Cohen is not Omarosa. And Trump seems to know it, says ⁦@michaelkruse⁩  https://t.co/IBFvuVrvKk

And Trump can’t say that Weisselberg “didn’t do big deals, did small deals.” (Though worth remembering that most of the Trump Org’s deals were “small deals” over the last two and a half decades.) https://t.co/Nk2HDTYyvN
2/2: ...Weisselberg is now implicated in that fraud, he’s been summoned to testify before a grand jury, and he knows far more about all of Trump’s financial dealings stretching back decades than Cohen. (Adding my July column here, too.) https://t.co/jU5i7csuyN

“Trump’s self-absorption and lack of loyalty may finally come back to haunt him. Hence, the president took to Twitter on Wednesday to remind his team that he still values omerta from his capos even if some of them have already ratted him out.” My column: https://t.co/qtDTePOueG
"In a divided, disbelieving nation, will this really turn out to be the epic moment it looks like? Or will Trump’s intense, years-long campaign to undermine the media — and truth itself — pay off now, in the clutch?" - @Sulliview https://t.co/2T51Qt3x4K
Early innings, even after Cohen-Manafort Day. https://t.co/t1PZv0liIP
“Cohen is saying that Trump was a principal of the crime he admits to having committed. Under federal law, that makes Trump criminally liable as an accomplice.” https://t.co/WPJi9mqDWy
“Never before has someone pleaded guilty in open court and said he acted at the direction of the president. We are therefore entering into a new phase of the Trump presidency — one that will be complex and treacherous for the president and for the country” https://t.co/WPJi9mqDWy
Meanwhile: “The publisher of a website that serves as a platform for white nationalism was a guest last weekend at the home of President Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.” (Kudlow says he was unaware of all of this.) https://t.co/nGu5438uTx
“Sometimes as the plea bargaining negotiations progress, it becomes apparent the potential cooperating witness does not possess sufficient valuable information...Ultimately they might have determined the juice might not be worth the squeeze.” https://t.co/VZ2XzF33OT

Deputy USA Robert Khuzami (Republican appointee) on Michael Cohen: "The essence of what this case is about is justice, and that is an equal playing field for all persons in the eyes of the law—and that is a lesson that Mr. Cohen learned today, and it is a very harsh one for him." https://t.co/xUB1oziAIO
Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami (a Republican appointee) on Michael Cohen: He “worked to pay money to silence two women who had information that he believed would be detrimental to the 2016 campaign, and to the candidate and the campaign." https://t.co/SpoP87d9FQ

Lol. Trumplandia continues to be populated by the best people. https://t.co/vOh3uYEevX
“Fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.” In confirming McGahn’s cooperation with Mueller, McGahn’s lawyer offers a standard that President Trump may find very hard to meet when his turn comes. https://t.co/7XUmCbFIt2
