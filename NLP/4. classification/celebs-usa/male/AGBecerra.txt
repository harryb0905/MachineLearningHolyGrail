@realDonaldTrump Sorry, Mr. President. #California will keep leaning forward. Instead of walls, we've built America's #1 economy and the 5th largest in the world - thanks in large part to our respect for the law and humane policies.

Thanks to a court order we secured, 276,000+ of our colleagues, classmates, &amp; family members with #DACA authorization may continue contributing to our communities. But ultimately, it's up to #Congress to pass a permanent #DACA fix. #Dreamers #DefendDACA https://t.co/ies8Ql7QC0
Yes, in 2019, we "may turn up the heat even more." As the @AP reports, we are ready to do whatever it takes to protect our people, values and resources in #California. https://t.co/02IPsykVgl
Good News: Thanks to our efforts in court, I am proud to stand with the more than 276,00 DACA recipients who have successfully renewed #DACA, allowing them to remain here and work legally. #ProtectDreamers #DefendDACA https://t.co/4BmoG8IvOg https://t.co/OiRcGCvrge

We secured $148.7 M of a $575 M nationwide settlement with #WellsFargo for its systematic misconduct. $WFC exploited customers, signed them up for products they never wanted, used add-ons to increase loan cost, and undermined trust in the banking system. https://t.co/Gk6V03uukD

Wishing everyone a #MerryChristmas and happy holidays! May the holiday be warm and peaceful for you and your loved ones!
In some good news: A court just knocked down @EPA's attempt to dismiss one of our lawsuits, in which we sued over EPA's failure to implement rules reducing landfill emissions. It's time to hold EPA accountable. #CutMethane #ActOnClimate https://t.co/PQb8hnp0hX https://t.co/uewkxUak1S
Dreamers play by the rules. So too should @DHSgov. Terminating #Dreamers‚Äô grants without notice or chance to appeal is unfair, illegal, and hurts our communities. Our coalition of 18 Attorneys General support @ACLU‚Äôs #DACA suit. https://t.co/lZ5dW8Mguz

The clock is ticking, and yet this administration continues to foolishly turn its back on any progress we‚Äôve made to safeguard future generations. #DirtyPowerPlan https://t.co/NDgsuTeWiM
Don't forget: in CA, our economy, climate &amp; health is deeply invested in the #CleanPowerPlan AND the #CleanCarStandards. Together, these 2 policies will cut 2.5 billion tons of carbon pollution by 2030, which = eliminating emissions from powering every US home for 2 years
We've filed comments against the #Trump Administration's misguided #DirtyPowerPlan proposal that benefits corporate polluters at the expense of everyone else. @realdonaldtrump is callously selling out our children's future and I demand he withdraw it immediately. https://t.co/iDTxD86QrS
We have zero tolerance for public officials who abuse their authority to enrich themselves. We just arrested a former #Merced police officer for an alleged $80,000+ #embezzlement scheme. https://t.co/xAN7ytApl8

As I told the @nytimes: Our resolve to protect a woman‚Äôs access to essential #healthcare, including #birthcontrol, has not and will not waver. https://t.co/vO7rcEqxgS #ProtectOurCare #womenshealth
.@BetsyDevosED must stop dragging her feet &amp; immediately provide relief to the tens of thousands of #studentloan borrowers eligible to have their debt forgiven, including those automatically eligible for relief because their schools closed.#HigherEdNotDebt https://t.co/yI9ClNVPIv
An anti-Semitic racist just killed and injured 17 Americans in Pittsburgh, a radical right domestic terrorist is charged with mailing pipe bombs to prominent Americans, and Republicans threaten healthcare protection for 133 million Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
True to form, President Trump is trying to divert Americans' attention from these disturbing challenges by announcing reckless policies that are unconstitutional #BirthrightCitizenship https://t.co/gdF5yje5Ud
California is continuing to support challenges to Trump‚Äôs discriminatory and regressive ban on #TransTroops serving openly in our military. Targeting qualified, capable, and courageous people who risk their lives for us is unpatriotic and unconstitutional. https://t.co/hIDhcOJtb6 https://t.co/sPcxiKsxGH
Truck drivers who deliver the goods that we rely on every day deserve breaks, and CA has a right to require these meal and rest breaks. @FMCSA should wholesale reject @TRUCKINGdotORG's petition to override California law. https://t.co/P6juiuoS6k https://t.co/tSFE2E8TNz

Just filed: On behalf of our coalition of 21 Attorneys General and 5 cities, we have submitted comment to @NHTSAGov and @EPA on their proposed rollback of our National #CleanCarStandards. Their plan is riddled with errors and based on faulty assumptions. https://t.co/fNFFUxCka1
The evidence is clear: we must act now to protect ourselves and future generations from the existential threat of climate change, but instead @RealDonaldTrump is driving us on a collision course with catastrophe. #CleanerCars #CleanCarStandards https://t.co/yCNVzUqoKJ https://t.co/JK0YS3xv3K
In California, we can‚Äôt afford to let @RealDonaldTrump backslide on our #CleanCarStandards. California families can‚Äôt afford to pay more at the pump, or leave their children a more polluted planet. https://t.co/fzyUqpOKg8
.@RealDonaldTrump chooses to ignore the overwhelming scientific consensus that we need to cut emissions to zero by 2050 to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate change impacts.
Our state is number one  #1 in clean energy; we sell more zero-emission #cleanercars than any other state. And we‚Äôve seen the effects of climate change firsthand, from record wildfires to massive mudslides. #CleanerCars #CleanCarStandards https://t.co/EoJSpY9NhF
We shouldn‚Äôt have to go to federal court to make our case. The math‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat a time where we‚Äôre facing a climate change crisis‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshould speak for itself. #CleanerCars #CleanCarStandards #CleanPowerPlan #ActOnClimate  https://t.co/RLAMhi56RW

Backsliding on #CleanCarStandards and the #CleanPowerPlan is a non-starter for California.  Stopping us from protecting our people, our jobs and economy, or our planet would be like trying to stop a parent from protecting a child. Make your voice heard today. https://t.co/0JcGlMvDW8
Watch what Trump does, not what he says.

We recently filed strong opposition to a proposed regulation by the @EPA that would restrict EPA‚Äôs access to critical scientific data. EPA just shelved this misguided proposal. Now they should get back to their core mission of protecting human #health &amp; the #environment
The part of town you live in shouldn't mean opportunities are closed to you.

Fourth, @EPAScottPruitt is depriving the public of the fair process the law requires. @EPA‚Äôs proposed repeal is being orchestrated by an Administrator, who as AG, challenged the #CleanPowerPlan on the very theories that @EPA now relies on to repeal it.
Third, the Clean Air Act requires @EPA to utilize the best system of emission reduction. @EPA‚Äôs repeal discards the most effective solution: increasing renewable and natural gas generation and reducing reliance on coal. EPA‚Äôs refusal to consider the realities is simply arbitrary.
Second, @EPA‚Äôs proposal attempts to artificially narrow its regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act, and runs directly contrary to Congress‚Äôs intent that @EPA have broad authority to address monumental sources of air pollution.
.@EPA‚Äôs proposed repeal of the #CleanPowerPlan is unlawful for at least 4 reasons.  First, repealing the #CleanPowerPlan with no substitute in place would mean that the @EPA is not regulating power plants‚Äô greenhouse gas emissions, as it is required to do under law.
HAPPENING NOW: The California Department of Justice is testifying at the @EPA‚Äôs listening session on the #CleanPowerPlan in San Francisco. Our message: we will not waver in our commitment to defend the #CleanPowerPlan: https://t.co/Yxfp2kentw https://t.co/rqw8m4WcSS

Today, my team, in charge of handling #cannabis implementation, spoke before the CA Assembly.  Our office will continue to:   - Closely monitor the cannabis market  - Work closely w/ #LawEnforcement to ensure strict compliance w/ CA law
Today and every day, grateful for the rich diversity and many contributions of the Asian American community in California and beyond. Happy #LunarNewYear to all who celebrate!
The stakes could not be higher ‚Äì climate change is the most important global environmental issue of our time. Our citizens have a right to be part of the climate change solution.

In #LosAngeles recently, my agents went in to collect two known registered firearms, they walked out with 25, including assault-type weapons, 18 magazines (including high capacity ones), and 2,000 rounds of ammunition #GunViolencePrevention

Here in California, we take the fight against human trafficking seriously. We know that education is key to keep our children out of the reach of labor or sex traffickers.

We also call on Congress to fully and immediately fund preparations for the 2020 Census. California simply has too much to lose for us to allow the Trump Administration to botch this important decennial obligation.
The California Department of Justice is putting President Trump on notice: if a citizenship question is added to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau questionnaire, we are prepared to take any and all necessary legal action to protect a full and accurate Census.
What the Trump Administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is illegal. The Constitution requires that, every 10 years, we accurately count every person in our country, regardless of citizenship status. This is a sacred responsibility. https://t.co/vxQbkB60WK
As this article notes, California would be adversely impacted by an inaccurate 2020 Census count. We will not stand idly by and let that happen. https://t.co/flaVM4pD9f

In just three months in office, Mick Mulvaney has rolled back important consumer protections. Enough is enough. We are today making clear that the Trump Administration is not above the law and that the acting director of the @CFPB should be Leandra English.
President Trump is attempting a hostile and illegal takeover of the @CFPB. He has installed as acting director a man who has consistently sided with Wall Street over Main Street, and hardworking Americans have been suffering as a result.

The @CFPB was created to protect consumers. Yet day after day, Mick Mulvaney, whose position as Acting Director of the @CFPB is under a legal cloud, fails abysmally to live up to this important responsibility.

@EPA The #CleanPowerPlan would reduce coal &amp; gas-fired power plant emissions by 16 percent by 2030, while avoiding 3,500 premature deaths per year. This is what Admin. Pruitt is against. He ought to do his job &amp; protect our environment instead of catering to the fossil fuel industry.

@CFPB President Trump, however, is attempting a hostile takeover of this independent agency by contravening the Dodd-Frank Act and installing as acting director a man who has repeatedly sided with Wall Street instead of Main Street. It is an absolute insult to hardworking Americans.
@CFPB Under the leadership of Richard Cordray, the CFPB set new standards for protecting mortgage and student borrowers, brought landmark actions against big banks, and proposed critical reforms to payday lending practices, mandatory arbitration, and bank overdraft fees.

Our Supreme Court would later affirm that segregation on public transit was  unconstitutional, showing the nation that discrimination would not be tolerated.
62 years ago, brave men and women in #Montgomery, Alabama declared, ‚Äúwe are not afraid.‚Äù The #MontgomeryBusBoycott was a courageous stand against racism and prejudice, towards full civil rights for all.
The California Department of Justice has zero tolerance for this type of egregious behavior. As the former Congressman from the area where Luxy is based, I know firsthand that the surrounding communities are sick and tired of the collective damage lead is causing their children.
Lead and cadmium are highly toxic metals that can cause physical and behavioral health problems at low levels of exposure, especially for our children. Luxy has continued to blatantly violate our laws, and in the process, jeopardized the wellbeing of our sons and daughters.
We are suing Luxy Accessory, Inc., a jewelry distributor based in LA, and its owner Hyun Sook Kim, for selling jewelry with excessive levels of lead and cadmium.   Much of the jewelry is intended for children, and some have been mislabeled as ‚Äúlead free": https://t.co/c4qm8ZPitD https://t.co/tP477WUAjB

Today: asking DC Circuit court to get case back on track in then-#HousevPrice to protect affordable #healthcare! #ProtectOurCare #ACA
Let us applaud the survivors, honor those we have lost, and observe October as #BCAM #BCSM
The #ACA expanded women‚Äôs access to preventive care like cancer screenings &amp; mammograms. We will continue to move forward with our fight
I support those at every step of their #breastcancer fight and vouch for policies that prioritize women‚Äôs health and access to #healthcare
October is #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth. 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over her lifetime‚Äôs course.
The fight for affordable #healthcare moves fwd! The judge made clear in his ruling that #ACA is law of the land. https://t.co/4nTRib177S
This conduct is unacceptable and it is illegal. Banks and financial institutions do not get to play fast and loose with the law.
They manipulated interest rates hoping to turn a quick profit. In the process, they left government entities &amp; non-profits holding the bag.
During the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank wrongly increased its profits at the expense of Californians.
Today, I announced a $220 million multistate settlement with Deutsche Bank for manipulating a key interest rate: https://t.co/Two8SyMqCg

@VP @CFPB As AG of California, I will continue to do everything in my power to protect consumers ‚Äì because doing so is what's right and just.
@VP @CFPB The #Trump Administration simply has no shame &amp; continues to do the bidding of Wall Street, even after the recent #EquifaxDataBreach.
@VP @CFPB His vote is the reason that the Rule, which allows people to seek justice when financial services companies break the law, has been killed.
Let this sink in: tonight, @VP Mike Pence traveled to the U.S. Capitol and voted to repeal the @CFPB‚Äôs Arbitration Rule. https://t.co/mnlBAVXwwh
@CalCourts My view is simple: #bail decisions should be based on danger to the public, not dollars in your pocket.

The Borrower Defense Rule is aimed at protecting students from deceptive loan servicing practices and fraud: https://t.co/CRj8i3A5nn

As parents &amp; guardians, it is our duty to protect our children. Today, that includes safeguarding their personal information.

Americans' call for unity and dialogue must continue to overwhelm the dangerous messages of hate and violence.
They aid and abet Donald Trump's worst instincts.
What is stunningly disturbing is the loss of backbone by too many Republican leaders unwilling to denounce the President's behavior
Last night we saw failed leadership in action. At a critical moment, Pres Trump resorted to tribalistic anger &amp; division at #PhoenixRally
As the state‚Äôs chief law enforcement officer, I‚Äôm committed to ensuring a thriving, competitive and fair marketplace.

The Trump Admin should focus on developing clean energy alternatives so this nation remains energy independent into the foreseeable future.
This decision does not make sense since the oil and gas industry has no interest in exploring and developing off California‚Äôs shore.
As their Attorney General, I will do everything possible to protect our state‚Äôs pristine natural resources.

It‚Äôs time for Trump to keep his promise to Dreamers &amp; protect this lawful initiative consistent with America‚Äôs dearest values #DefendDACA
We can all agree Dreamers who benefit from #DACA are ‚Äúincredible kids‚Äù and that we should treat them ‚Äúwith heart,‚Äù as Trump has said
DACA is an overwhelming success story for DACA grantees, their communities &amp; our states--AND a fully lawful exercise of executive discretion
I led a group of 20 state attorneys general in sending a letter to President Trump urging him to #DefendDACA https://t.co/4W2XXxPHLJ
Dreamers have become military members, law enforcement officials, and teachers educating the future leaders of this country -- their country
As son of immigrants, I find such fearmongering repulsive. As father of 3 daughters, I'm heartbroken when I meet young people living in fear
Yet Trump has sent mixed messages about DACA. Some have taken this as a license to disparage Dreamers &amp; scorned other hardworking immigrants
Over the past 5 years, #DACA has given nearly 800,000 young Dreamers the opportunity to step out of the shadows #DefendDACA #HereToStay
