The best part of this is that there will be a rematch.
This is why boxing is crazy.
Fury looking good for the first half.  Wilder has to get going NOW!!
Freddy Roach is always in somebody’s corner in a big fight.

I think all schools should have a program similar to this one that @frozen1_1906 &amp; FSU has setup for all student athletes.
@frozen1_1906 has implemented an awesome program that I think all schools should have one like this. The pros call it "Player Development".
Topics addressed include: effective communication, values and ethics, conflict resolution, goal setting, time management &amp; leaving a legacy.
FSU's R.E.A.L. Men provide an opportunity for male student-athletes to further develop their leadership and personal development skills.
Thanks FSU,@frozen1_1906 &amp; the R.E.A.L. (Reliable Educated Approachable Leaders) Men program for having me speak to the student athletes! https://t.co/tOyOqBU2YB

Real cool story on nba countdown with @TheRealJRSmith.
Westbrook is a baaaadddd man!!!!
Wow!! I'd be flat out lying if I said I thought this series would be tied at 2-2. I thought it was over. Raptors say otherwise.
Lowry and Derozan tho.......sheesh!! Safe to say whatever was wrong ain't wrong with either of them tonite.
Bizmack has been flat out impressive!!
Great game right now!! Toronto's crowd is amazing!  Kyrie and Frye ballin too
Great resilience by the raptors. New life in series. Would have been tough heading to Miami down 0-2.  Valacunios was huge!
Can't help but LOVE and RESPECK what UD has done his whole career for Miami!! #heart&amp;soul
Just alternate posting up/isolating DWade or JJ.  #toolittle #toogood
Joe Joe and his big body is wearing the raptors down. Starting to get into his groove and comfort zone. Don't let him get his tempo.....

@JT_Money_24 Morris with the way shady been out there. But he gon go crazy one of these weeks real soon. Lol
“@CharlieMack29: @QRich what QB's do you have?” I'm good there......Peyton!!!
@JT_Money_24 I'm thinking Cruz against the Eagles but not sure bcu Edelman has been Brady's fav target so far I think.
“@Phinattic: @QRich You still about that 1-3-5 life?”  Fasho
“@JT_Money_24: @QRich I got the same problem plus Cruz or Edelman? Lol #choices” another tough call
“@billymagz13: @QRich welkers on Denver my dude”. Lol. Correct u are. What I should have said is Welker has been getting more &amp; more snaps.
With the Luck has been ballin Wayne may be the safe choice over Welker. I liked what Brady and the Patriots did last week tho. 💬💬💬
On the fence with Cruz and Jackson still will definitely ask again about them on Sunday.
Glad most of you chose Tate, that's who I was leaning towards.
Must say I'm surprised by how many of you guys said gates over gronk...he's trending up I thought after last week. Gates did have 18 tho. 💬💬
Thanks for the help everyone who replied. Gonna come callin again on Sunday mornings.
Needed those responses to reassure myself.  Lol. Gonna post on Sunday morn who I'm going with this week. Decisions Decisions.  💬💬💬

@R2theickie wow!! Is that the real Gatorade acct?!
Skip hit em with the curveball right there. “”Spurs did close out w/out TP who is their best player.
Gatorade’s stock maybe took a bump up after last night?! Anyone know?
“@lairdy2012: @QRich Held ur video cam draft night w/Butler, Sister, DMiles n other coaches.  Still got the video?” I wish
“@KnicksMemes: I cramped up once playing baseball in the park in 4th grade and thought the world was ending.” 😂😂😂😂
Skip giving his numbers on how he gets it in on the training side. 😂😂😂 marathons are no joke tho. Much respect!
They killing Powerade!  Lol
The look on Stephan A’s face while Skip talks is hilarious!! Lol
And they got Zeke @iamisiahthomas and the homey S.Jackson too. Let’s go!!
First Take time!!! Buckle up!!! Can’t wait to hear what the crew has to say about the big game. #lockedin

@B_Cashin ridiculous Cash Money!! Smh. Not a very like able guy b4 this and after…..forget about it.
@ChicoBonds agreed. Bcuz he could play some ball.

@Cheep_keef lol. I respect that
I wish I owned a big a/c company in San Antonio. 💭💭💭
I would love to see some of these ppl walk around their house with cramps like that, don’t even mention playing in a bball game.
Timmy kept it real. Don’t want anyone to get hurt but they can’t worry about that.
I bet that AC will be on blast for Game 2!!
Nail
@_Michaelinho u a fool for the last one bruh. Wow!

This has to suck!! I don’t wanna get the defending champs in this way. I mean of course the spurs wanna win but y’all feel me.
This is really crazy!
@DaunieDaune lol.
Wow!! Great game!
Great pass!!
Big turnaround since Lebron went to the bench.

“@MalikRose: @QRich 😄 Absolutely.  Would’ve laid 👋 on him. Lol” Facts!! Hahah. Young Chump. Lol
@MalikRose tryin too hard. He’s talented but most definitely has to grow up. U know me Leek and u know how i’d have done him. Lol
@MalikRose bcuz those were two all time greats Leek. This, clearly is NOT!! Lol.  Blowing on ppl ear n stuff. I know his breath was stankin
“@ChrisPalmerNBA: Funniest thing I’ve seen in a while. Bout to play Super Mario Bros 3. http://t.co/tqhOV1ZCIN” doesn’t get much better. Lol
@TherealAdnan stop playin man. Lol. U know I’m rollin wit DWade
“@TherealAdnan: @QRich Best shoot guard you played with?” DWade
Manziel out there at OTAs rockin them Jordan Retro 6 cleats. Browns color way. Mean man!!! Mean!!
“@drich666: @QRich Best point guard you played with?” Prior to nba it would be @cdell112
“@drich666: @QRich Best point guard you played with?” @SteveNash
“@drich666: @QRich Hardest two guard you ever had to defend?” In the league Kobe, hands down.
“@drich666: @QRich Hardest two guard you ever had to defend?” MJ before I made the league.
“@_Michaelinho: @QRich gotta open that lane up so mike can get 60” facts. That’s what ppl sleep on. MJ still gon get all the FGAs. Always!
“@Mike91889: @QRich @MalikRose this is mine: magic, dwade, LBJ, Tim Duncan, and dream” tough
“@MalikRose: “@daaron8: @MalikRose Isaiah, Jordan, Dr.J, Duncan, Hakeem” Zeke and Jordan gonna be able to play together??” Yes they will.
“@MalikRose: Wow… Was having a great morning and the news of Maya Angelou’s passing just ended that. RIP Ms Angelou.” Truth
@_Michaelinho I respect that. I went TD and Shaq bcuz I like the era of classic hoop when it was 2 true big guys on the block. Like dirk tho
RIP Maya Angelou. You will be missed.
@Just4kicks401 @MalikRose niceee
@FunnyNbaGuy I can dig that
@FunnyNbaGuy @MalikRose there should still be a center slot for Allstar tho. I don’t agree with that change.
“@MalikRose: @QRich I think I’m gonna do a list with the same prices but eliminate position. That one will be CRAZY!!” FACTS!!!
“@MalikRose: “@QRich: @MalikRose I like this one Leek” I had two teams. A luxury tax team and a non luxury tax team.  Lol” not surprising

Wake up to Westbrook/Jordan highlights running together on ESPN. Kinda confirms the young boy showed up &amp; showed out last night!! #ballin
@drich666 I hope he does. He’s one of my favorite players
Corey Joseph!!?!?
Uh oh
Westbrook had a couple of knee surgeries?! I can’t tell! Boy still got all his bounce! #IsItTheShoes #jordanbrand #jumpman
The roof mite have come off that building if he banged that lob right there!
If Okc can keep this up, this is a whole new series. And they will have momentum headed back to San An
KD got it goin tonight.
Westbrook has a different switch than almost anyone else in the league. #explosive
“@TrevorAriza: “@QRich: Big game tonight!! Who y’all got?!” #gokingsgo” stop it bro!! U know what it is! #chitown
Breen, MJax &amp; JVG are a great team on the announcing side! I agree with them a lot!

@Peeje24 #facts

Have to respect what Timmy, Manu &amp; Tony have accomplished together. Winningest trio in history! Wow!!! Just wow!
@FunnyNbaGuy agreed
Spurs look tough as usual. Duncan is a mystery, but in a really good way.
@REAL_MRobinson ✊
@CUREHDSAORG 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Just checked Wiggins on First Take. Seems like a hunble, down to earth kid. Wish him the best on taking this next step to league.
Pacers mean business today!
@Doesit_DAILEY lol
I like how DWest plays out there. #bluecollar
Man I hope DWade give Stephenson 50 today!! Kid is a idiot. Competition is competition, never wish/hope injury on anyone. #classLESS
“@JCrossover: There’s enough room for everyone to be successful..” #facts
@JoseBeMe_ all day!!
@Andrew_GD thanks man
@All_Legs22 I wanna see Thunder/Heat but smart money says Spurs/Heat. We shall see tho. This is why they play the games.
Spurs/Thunder &amp; Pacers/Heat. Let’s goooooooo!!
Congrats to the Thunder. Salute to the Clips! After all they got hit with in these playoffs they still fought it out. #WeAreOne
@ajguyton it’s debatable man. But I do agree that the term is used too loosely.
@iamisiahthomas dropping some knowledge on @ESPN_FirstTake ChiTown and NBA Great….listen up kids!
S/O the @jameernelson on @NBATV. Glad they got that champagne for you bro.  Lmao!!
Joe Joe Dancing out there!! #cookin
@Fidusei been good man. Still live here in Orlando.
@mister25eight haha.  Cannot tell a lie, I have had a few cold right out the fridge on the leftovers side. Lol. Preciate the support.
Welp. There u have it.
@Marty2634 I hope not. We need the talent from the city. We have some of the best talent in the country year in and year out.
Kenny Chuck Shaq and Ernie bout to speak some things too.
“@miyukiish: @QRich It was Lawler’s law! Clippers scored 100 first. Under the law Clippers were supposed to win! Damn!!”  It is the Law. Lol
@BunBTrillOG will be understandable tho.
“@BunBTrillOG: Doc Rivers is definitely bout to get that fine in the post-game conference. No way he lets the officiating slide.” I hope not
@miyukiish just good bball.
Can’t wait for @ESPN_FirstTake tomorrow to hear them go at it about this game. “Oh me oh my” in my Ralph Lawler voice.
Tough, hard fought game.  Great series!! You gotta LOVE this!!
Buckle up!
@austenrillo good bball
Wow!!….again!!
@_Michaelinho u bogus fam. Lol
Steve Kerr Classic line “and then all hell breaks loose” lol
Wow
@wilsonchandler was just crackin up by myself. Lol.
Every time Kenny says he’s goin to the board I think about the Kevin hart commercial. Lol. Too funny.
@RealWillEasy lol. I don’t doubt it.
@4whatUtellme @warriorsworld Stan would NEVER be anyone’s puppet. Would not take the job before that happened. Not in his pedigree.
@jonathanhihi my choice would be Stan
@jermaine611 lol. Probably not. He’ll just get the job done.
Never played for a coach that was more prepared than Stan!! We always knew every option the other team had on their plays and knew sets too!
Hated to see M. Jackson fired but I think Stan Van Gundy is easily one of the best coaches available and would be an excellent choice!!
@miyukiish thank you!!! 😬
@JCrossover always love fam!
Congrats to the homey “Young Mal” @JCrossover on that 6th man award! Keep doin work fam! ✊
“@chibbs_1: @stephenasmith @QRich I agree with my guy @stephenasmith ,”  So do I.
Salute to Craig Sager. Get well soon sir! One of the Best!
@KennyHaz check u out pimpin. Lol. I 👀 u
@Moe4nelson yup. U too
@drillsgt2011 fact!!
@Moe4nelson no doubt. I’m coolin too. Preciate it
@drillsgt2011 I agree. I like mark Jackson. Obviously something more to it than we all are aware of. The team def liked him as their coach.
@drillsgt2011 can’t believe that. But that’s how it was at the end if last season too. Look at G. Karl. Tough job these days.
@Moe4nelson coolin fam. How u
Congrats to @KDTrey5 great year dog!! Much deserved MVP.
Lillard is RIDICULOUS!!!! #gameover
Green is a huge key to the warriors.  He does so many different things that help them.
“@nate_robinson: @IAM_NFLKEV @Qrich classic nights” so many!!
“@B_Cashin: @QRich @chasitymelvin 2 years against OAKTOWN got him ready hahah” facts!!
@Jaye_M haha. Machtar!! ✊
@CTownsendTV that would be a DM.
“@dantesobe: @QRich you even fit in that Audi fam? Lol” I can actually fit
“@chasitymelvin: @QRich but then Q you went straight pro so you missed out or did you miss out lol…ha” I did 2yrs of school. Then bounced.
@chasitymelvin lol. I can imagine. That’s why I can’t believe this situation. Just foolishness.
Did I mention I Love First Take? They get it in!
@chasitymelvin lol. Whatever he does, he can’t be out here using the “five finger discount”. C’mon now!
@drillsgt2011 I agree. It sucks, but sometimes it is necessary.
@CurtisBusse we all know the difference to an extent.
@chadwendel lol. Hilarious but I know u feel me. They are good tho.
He is in an unbelievable position of privelege! Heisman winner as a Frosh! He can write his own story from here…totally up to him.
I hope someone close to Winston grabs him and has a real talk with him. Being a Pro is a honor and privelege NOT a certainty. Respect it!! ✊
Some crab legs tho? I don’t know exactly what happened but c’mon man! That’s just some youthful foolishness goin on. Not cool man.
Stephan A just kept it 💯 about Winston from FSU. Kid has to be smarter and try his best to stay away from ANY negativity out there.
@_MWill 😂😂😂 it be like that! I feel u. I’ve won be cuz of it too tho so I can’t front.
@_MWill lol. That’s hilarious dog!! Tyson kinda like that on there too. Lol. Always happens when u ain’t shot wit em in a min and u forget.
facts fam!! Lol. RT@_MWill: u be siiick when u let the button go early as shit when somebody got a long freethrow on 2k
@B_Cashin 😉
Very sincere and direct speech as well as all of his answers for the questions fielded. Adam Silver and the NBA staff handled their business
NBA, job well done! Swift and Hard! Would be pretty sweet if Magic ended up as the next Owner!
✊
RIP to the great Dr. Jack Ramsay!
I hope this situation will truly be dealt with after this investigation concludes. Something has to be done! An example MUST be made!
Sad scenario playing out with Clips. To personally know ppl of diff races that work within that org I feel bad that they have to ensure this
CP3!!
@Jaye_M @LynDotJones @Tony_DixonJr @DexOcean @Rio113 lol. Here u go @Jaye_M haha. He just a tad bit nicer than u bruh.

I gotta ask. Is this the best NCAA tourney EVER!? Huge upsets early on to the GREAT games throughout. Down to the wire games &amp; big shots!!
UConn’s backcourt play is tough!! Offensively and Defensively!

@BigJah22 beleeedat!! Lol. I know what it’s lookin like tho.  Talked to my sister and pops all week about it. I’m chillin tho. 😎
@CTownsendTV I hope he learns from it and comes back better.
@CTownsendTV yea that was tough. Can’t do that tho. No matter what is said. At this point, there has been too many incidents already.
@BigJah22 yea I remember that.
@CTownsendTV it is good fam
@BigJah22 yea man. That was real life right there.
@Kyle_OQuinn was just on showtime bout an hour ago.
I applaud Lenny Cook for being brave enough to share his story. Say what u will but a lot of guys wouldn’t have done this film.
Sure he was just as responsible but he was a kid being taken advantage of by grown adults. Kids can learn ALOT from Lenny Cook’s story.
Lenny Cook story is one that all youngsters should see. Sad but true reality of how TOO MANY kids make choices and get taken advantage of..
@shawnaontheair I’m great!! How have you been? How is reporting going for you?
