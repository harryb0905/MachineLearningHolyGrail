@DolanNed No, they’re being hurt by it but Americans are still paying the tax. The tax is on American businesses and consumers. It’s really not a debate. And it’s not a commentary on the policy. It’s just a statement of fact. The president continually misleads on that point.
@DolanNed Sure, that’s his argument which is fine. It’s just not paid by China.
@DolanNed They certainly don't get it from China. They pay the tax themselves, raising their costs and passing along those costs to consumers in some cases. It's not splitting hairs. It's simply untrue.
Trump also talked (again) about all the money "China" is paying us. As we've said many times, that's not how it works. The tariffs are paid by U.S. importers. #TradeWar https://t.co/FxPFZsahYC

The Dow closes lower by 653 points. Merry Christmas.
The Fed apparently needs to work on its short game. https://t.co/OVVFF1n1GG
The Treasury Department maintains Mnuchin calls were meant to be "preemptive" and should be viewed as "reaffirming good news." We are told @stevenmnuchin1 thought this was a prudent move after last week's market volatility.
My bet is the Mnuchin calls may have been more him reassuring CEOs about Powell than them reassuring him about liquidity. Still, it'll be interesting to see how investors react in a shortened session. Bottom line: it's easy to see how this could backfire.
Good morning and Merry Christmas. I'm in for Neil on #CoastToCoast at 12pmET on FBN and on #YourWorld at 4pmET on FNC. No @AftertheBell today - stock market closes at 1pmET.

That’s what @JackMcShane26 calls a “great loss” for the #Jets. Darnold keeps improving and so does the team’s draft position.

Paul Ryan: @POTUS just told us he won't sign Senate bill.
Mnuchin says Treasury is in "close contact" with the Fed on the normalization of the balance sheet. He says he's "comfortable with the supply" and doesn't see it as the issue some investors seem to.
Mnuchin tells Varney he thinks the market is "overreacting" to the Fed. He adds, "U.S. equities have tremendous value."
This is the real “A Team” right here. Fun times. Happy Holidays. https://t.co/bIfUBULNgy
Powell gives the expected answer when asked about pressure from @realDonaldTrump - he says, "political considerations play no role whatsoever" in any decisions about monetary policy.
Powell: we feel we've reached the bottom end of the range of what might be considered "neutral." The path from here, he says, contains a fairly high degree of uncertainty.
Powell: "We will adjust monetary policy the best we can..."
Powell on 2019 growth: we see growth moderating, which is different than earlier view of a "rising" trajectory.
Powell: We think the economy will call for two rate increases next year (remember: futures market pricing in ZERO).
Breaking: Fed raises rates - anticipates two hikes next year.
Happy Fed Day to @Brady_FBN and all those who celebrate. I’ll be hosting our award winning @FoxBusiness coverage today at 2pmET. Looking forward to it.

If tariffs on Chinese goods go from 10% to 25%, what will the impact be on the economy? Kudlow says it’s “just a fraction of our economy.” He also says the U.S. is better positioned to weather it than China. #TradeWar
Kudlow says the U.S. economy is in “very good shape” heading into #G20. China, he says, “not so good.” #TradeWar
Kudlow says @realDonaldTrump and Xi Jinping will have a “dinner meeting” at the G20. He says @POTUS thinks there’s a “good possibility” a deal can be made, but issues of intellectual property theft, forced transfer of technology and significant tariff barriers “must be solved.”

@GaryKaltbaum good point
The economy grew faster-than-expected last quarter. GDP growth of 3.5%, driven by the consumer, is a solid number. Now investors can figure out if good news is good news or good news is bad news for the stock market.
@hiddenhandsz It’ll be both. As we talked about at the end, the risk for the GOP is more undecideds break against them because they tend to be more anti-Trump than voters overall.

He can find other markets to sell into, but not at the same price. We will likely do a Facebook LIVE later today on all this.
@mmcmaterials @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria He told me this morning this trend is not sustainable. Lower prices eventually mean lower land prices, mortgage defaults etc. We will speak about it in more detail in later reports. That said, as he will tell you, something had to be done about China. So it’s complicated.
Iowa farmer Ron Heck’s dog Lucy joined us live on @MorningsMaria. The #TradeWar is really cutting into Ron’s bottom line. He says he’s down about 15% from last year. With no end in sight to the tensions, he says this path is just not sustainable. https://t.co/9TWAz4Nji5

This Giants-Jags game is unwatchable, which raises an obvious question: why am I watching it?
@sidrosenberg Missed it live - listening to the podcast - sounds great
Good stuff from my buddy @sidrosenberg - will have to make this show a regular Sunday morning habit. https://t.co/LAECXXWQ6v
The Giants just tried an entire drive with Barkley and Beckham pretty much alternating plays. I don’t think anyone else touched the ball. #SettleForFieldGoal
@USA_my_BFF No I’m not saying that. I’ve always thought he was a genius, but appreciate that even more now. And the focus for many has been on marijuana - which misses out on all the actual content covered.
This is 100% true. I don’t know what it means for $TSLA shareholders, but I do know the interview is worth watching/listening to/learning from. https://t.co/Z48NEvfZjE
Whole Foods has given us a statement saying it has an “open-door policy” and already offers “competitive wages and benefits.” $AMZN https://t.co/JX9ZjuSr5W
We’ve obtained an email sent today to Whole Foods workers which encourages them to unionize. Among other things, it says they should demand a $15/hour minimum wage, 401k matching &amp; lower insurance deductibles. $AMZN https://t.co/moNvRrvaF6
Will Amazon have to deal with Whole Foods workers pushing to unionize? The @RWDSU tells us it’s trying to help, providing a statement highlight part-time workers it says can’t get enough hours. No comment from Amazon or Whole Foods. https://t.co/DC3x3W3uQX
This COULD be a big deal. We'll be reporting from Whole Foods today on this story - Group of Whole Foods workers want to unionize, but parent Amazon has resisted past efforts to organize labor at its businesses  https://t.co/YJMXN7Es0d via @WSJ

I’m in for Trish at 2pmET so join us on @FoxBusiness. We’ll take apart the deal with Mexico, look at the stock market rally and remember Sen. John McCain with @SusanLiTV @robertwolf32 @tomborelli @DougWead (among others).
Trump: “We’ll get rid of the name NAFTA. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by NAFTA.”
The market loves the NAFTA progress - some more details here from Reuters. Two hurdles left to clear: Canada &amp; Congress. https://t.co/MGmWJgZxXx
@UCTS01 no it's not. It's routinely been extended in similar circumstances. There was also the option of a Presidential Proclamation. That didn't happen either.
@UCTS01 Yes, the MINIMUM requirement is being met. That's all. It's by no means normal.
After seeing this headline, I had to check multiple sources to see if it was really true. Apparently it is. https://t.co/5MhAnz8Vof

@AshWebsterFBN @Sarge986 @TeamCavuto This was during your "London years." I fondly recall when the window washer would show up behind you when you were live.
@AshWebsterFBN @TeamCavuto let the record show it was Ashley Webster who made the food/weight joke. That's A-S-H-L-E-Y.
This picture was actually taken on 3/9/09. It certainly appears as if I’m trying to convince Neil the market is about to bottom and begin its longest bull run in history. @TeamCavuto https://t.co/ycBzctPG1u

Even tonight, Trump takes his shot at McCain (a regular rally occurrence).
Now a message from Lanny Davis: https://t.co/0aaOWpUOWe
We don’t yet know what happens next, but we do know this is exactly what happened today. https://t.co/jiOb6ALeB3
We started the hour wondering whether Cohen not cooperating with prosecutors was GOOD news for @POTUS. We ended it wondering something very different, as @MichaelCohen212 claims he committed a crime at the direction of @realDonaldTrump.
Tuesday https://t.co/vqmvyTeUJi
Even by 2018 standards, that was some hour. Trump’s former campaign chairman was found guilty on 8 counts and his former personal attorney said he broke campaign finance law at the direction of a candidate (Trump).
Hits keep coming... ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty of 8 charges; mistrial declared on 10 others.
I know Washington can handle busy news days, but adding a Daniel Murphy trade to Manafort, Cohen etc might be enough to put the city over the top.
We will talk about this today on @AftertheBell. Elizabeth Warren wants to ban lawmakers from owning individual stocks (among other things). https://t.co/E5ARlsE00m #FoxNews
Another beauty here on the Twitter flashback scene. This was three days before the bottom - turned out to be a lot more than a bear market rally. https://t.co/i20QGUx5Dj
Here's my genius question on Twitter the morning after the stock market low in March of '09. It turns out we've seen the longest BULL market in history, and the S&amp;P 500 has gained over 300%. Who knew?! https://t.co/3uFTClpzuk

The Permian Basin oil boom continues, but it would be even bigger without the steel tariffs.  https://t.co/bSkTKub8rB
@LadyBleuLady @FoxBusiness We did and you can watch the response during the segment posted on Facebook
Watch this. We had an in-depth discussion on the red hot Permian Basin from on top of an active drilling rig. We touched on all the issues: the West Texas boom, pipeline capacity concerns, environmental questions, impact from the tariffs. Plus, it... https://t.co/q3OcoZOeu7
Tommy Taylor from Fasken Oil: “By the end of next year, 2019, we think we’re going to have enough pipeline capacity but if things work like we think they’re going to, we’re going to bump up against that again.” #OilBoom #PermianBasin ⁦@FoxBusiness⁩  https://t.co/QhDhOjqrWk
We’re in the Permian Basin today where analysts say it’s going to take 12-18 months for pipeline capacity to catch up with demand. But...there’s such a boom here, the expectation is they’ll be right up against it soon after that. #OilBoom #PermianBasin
TV cameras don’t often get a live look at the oil drilling process. We’ll have it today on @FoxBusiness from the red hot Permian Basin in West Texas. https://t.co/FwWLa5agdu

Paul Ryan weighs in - saying ⁦@POTUS⁩ “must appreciate that Russia is not our ally.” https://t.co/DKP4amsM5X
Just a reminder ... this actually happened today. Trump says he doesn’t 'see any reason' why Russia would have hacked the US election when asked whether he believes Putin or the US intel community. https://t.co/KcY1HXF3JJ
The only question I can even think of right now is...will we see any resignations as a result of this? If so, who?
Now we will see how allies of the President defend that performance...
Trump is given another chance to denounce Russia, but he takes a pass. Instead, @POTUS is bashing his own FBI in front of Vladimir Putin. He says Putin has made "an incredible offer" to allow intelligence officers to be interviewed.
When asked about this tweet, @POTUS says he holds "both countries" responsible for the relationship going south. He's says "both side made some mistakes" and then goes on a rant about there being no collusion etc... https://t.co/yOv2i8dE4r
Dan Coats is worth watching ahead of the #TrumpPutinSummit. He says the “warning lights are blinking red again” and warns of a large-scale cyber attack. The biggest threat? Russia.  https://t.co/1iwLkFvVSo

Back at work - hosting @EveningEdit on @FoxBusiness today &amp; tomorrow at 5pmET - then #ANHQ on @FoxNews on Saturday 2pmET, 4pmET.
It’s one thing the Mets are still televised, but quite another that I wasted a perfectly good night watching them. That’s on me.
Have you all had a chance to check out the great Rob Bartlett’s new podcast? If not, see below and subscribe! @TheRobio https://t.co/t6GLxjjdo3
@goingjag @TripGrace3 @comictonypowell People: Michael Porter, Jr. is a basketball player who was not drafted by the Knicks. This has nothing to do with the President.
This Axios poll shows how upside down the world is. We now have protectionist Republicans fighting against free-trade Democrats. #TradeWar https://t.co/0NE0yoBugs
Well, the Knicks pretty much clinched a Hall of Fame career for Michael Porter, Jr.
@jbennet597 @POTUS He did something to stop his own policy. The rate of separation had dramatically increased under the “zero tolerance” policy.
Separation of families did not appear to be playing well even among Trump’s most enthusiastic supporters. I spoke to a number of people at last night’s rally, many of them women, who were not comfortable with it and were happy to see him sign the executive order.
That’s a wrap from Duluth. Trump rally recap: huge crowd, big emphasis on the economy, less emphasis on immigration than usual, a few protesters. And, as he has done many times, the President takes a shot at the ailing Sen. John McCain (without mentioning his name). https://t.co/ppqlBgE5e3
Another Trump criticism of @SenJohnMcCain’s healthcare vote. “Thumbs down...that was not a good thing he did.”
Some protesters have made it in the arena, including one directly in front of Trump. “Get him out of here. Go home to mom, darling. Was that a man or a woman because he needs a haircut more than I do.” https://t.co/BBicVT5D1l
Trump: “Today I signed an executive order. We’re going to keep families together but the border is going to be just as tough as it’s been.”
Trump with a line that plays well here in Duluth: “We’re fighting to protect American iron, aluminum and steel and to protect our very brave miners.”
After his meeting with Kim Jong Un, @POTUS tells crowd in Duluth: “Right now you are so safe...”
.@POTUS introduces congressional candidate Pete Stauber. “Pete, say a few words. He wasn’t supposed to do this.” Stauber pulls out prepared notes from his jacket pocket.
Trump starts Duluth rally by saying he came “this close” to winning Minnesota and it’s going to be “very easy I think” in 2020. https://t.co/SY6tRXZZDG
There are many areas of the country worried about the President’s trade policy. Duluth, Minnesota does not appear to be one of them (which may explain why there’s a Trump rally here tonight). https://t.co/wlI6n8A2JI
As @POTUS is pressured by business groups about the impact of his tariffs, he may find a receptive audience here in Duluth. One voter just told me the steel &amp; aluminum tariffs will “level the playing field.” https://t.co/7uj8O1vtnt
Good morning from Duluth, Minnesota. @realDonaldTrump rallies here later today. He will first meet with workers from the steel mining industry - trying to show the POSITIVE impact of tariffs. https://t.co/ABg6uaHinU

Iowa soybean farmers say there are “no winners” in a #TradeWar. Soybean prices have been falling, and farmers fear that will continue. This statement is from Iowa Soybean Association President Bill Shipley: https://t.co/bXZnwbdNY3
@anvilinvest Yes and it doesn’t. The theory would be people are more likely to “buy American” if the foreign goods are more expensive, but the fear is retaliation hurts other American industries (such as soybeans in the case of China).
I think it’s worth repeating - trade is the one issue Trump actually seems to believe in. He was saying the same thing in the ‘80s. The only difference is the technology has advanced beyond VCR’s and it’s China, not Japan. #TradeWar
Here’s the @POTUS statement on imposing 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. He says the goods being taxed include those related to the “Made in China 2025” initiative. #TradeWar https://t.co/MY8Z76uuuB
Even after all these years, I’m guilty of really only caring about @TigerWoods at the @usopengolf. He’s in a great group today at 1:47pm w/ Justin Thomas and Dustin Johnson. I’ll rely on @MelissaAFrancis for updates on @AftertheBell.

@Lougise That might be true. One solid rationale for content providers to team up with tech companies or mobile phone companies is the access to information about their customers for targeted advertising. Facebook, Google &amp; even AT&amp;T know a lot about people.
Ha...but maybe not. I don’t think they’ve worked that out yet and the @ussoccer_mnt might still have to qualify because there are three countries involved. #WorldCup2026 https://t.co/rY9YSUsR2N

@Lougise That was a horizontal merger. This was vertical. It’s odd they even brought the case, which is why so many people think its political.
@Lougise The case was largely based on them withholding or leveraging their content from other providers (“must have” content) which they don’t have an incentive to do. And the star witness was apparently a complete dud. This was a pretty easy ruling.
@Lougise Lou!! Monopoly? They don’t have one. The government just didn’t have a case here and the judge let them know.

@mike_curd First, the tweet states a fact, doesn’t give an opinion. Second, you seem to be criticizing free trade, which is a traditionally conservative, not liberal, position. Other than that...

This is exactly what I was reporting yesterday - Dems see GOP healthcare focus as a midterm “gift”  https://t.co/Y1RHvvOB4r
@BWest187 That looks good!!
Abby Finkenhauer won her House primary here in Iowa. Fred Hubbell took the gubernatorial primary. Both are thought to have a good shot this November. Key state to watch for Democrats. https://t.co/sU0iy8xNdj
If 29-year-old Abby Finkenhauer wins here in Iowa today (and in November), she would be the youngest woman ever elected in the House. Democrats need wins from candidates like her to have any shot at pulling off a so-called “Blue Wave.” https://t.co/X7UYhPL09n
Is the Blue Wave really going to hit? We talked politics this morning at an Iowa diner. #Midterms2018  https://t.co/tGfd3wc3cP
We just wrapped up a Facebook LIVE broadcast from Iowa. It’s worth watching for a discussion of big issues in play for the midterms. https://t.co/vkVAIlKi0o
@MBCompanyMan Baker!! It was like a CIA operation out here. We even had a drone with us.
We’ve been getting questions about this. The actual tariff is 3%, but there was a 13% value added tax as of last year (hence 16%). That’s been lowered twice, and is now 10%. But, China has threatened to add another 25%, which COULD mean an effective rate of 35%. #TradeWar https://t.co/IIajNy0VAc
The #TradeWar worries are real here in Iowa. Take a closer look, with some great work by FBN’s Pete Regina, flying a drone to bring you these pictures.  https://t.co/MtnpW4aQjz
@KevinSc86173352 It’s time frame. He said they’ve come down over the last few years, but up in recent months
Iowa farmer Ron Heck did the calculation. The named tariff, he says, is currently at 3% with a 13% value added tax. His point is the overall tax is currently 16%, and China has threatened to raise it. #Trade https://t.co/NZ4yDRS0bW
As @realDonaldTrump tweeted right after this report, China does already charge a 16% tariff on U.S. soybeans. Farmer Ron Heck would like to see that lowered, but also worries the Chinese could shift more purchases to Brazil &amp; Argentina. #TradeWar https://t.co/mzuKYcdzWZ
Iowa farmer Ron Heck tells us his worry is China shifts more of its soybean purchases to Brazil &amp; Argentina because of trade tension. But he also says it’s possible he comes out ahead if negotiations are done right. #TradeWar  https://t.co/NHjSzBgRj7
Good morning from Iowa. Farmers here are watching the China trade talks VERY closely. The U.S. exports $12 billion in soybeans each year to China. #TradeWar https://t.co/01VJogKUs3
@mkahrer @badputter58 Most economists agree it would be, especially with our allies. I would supposed the goal is to get concessions, and call it off before it's out of hand. We'll see.
@CGasparino But in the meantime, if you did it, we'd still fire you! You just wouldn't go to jail.
@CGasparino I know - I didn't say it was illegal. I was answering someone who thought it was.
It doesn't appear to be illegal. However, I'm fairly certain the President would have been suspended or fired if he was an economics reporter. Fortunately for him, he's not. https://t.co/s7GtU47rFA

@SwingWhisperer @POTUS @TeamCavuto @TuckerCarlson @larryelder @MariaBartiromo @LouDobbs This is my last response. This is not just you - there seems to be less appreciation by the day for balance and accuracy. I know that if you actually listened the first time, you’d realize the issues were presented fairly and accurately. Have a good night.
@SwingWhisperer @POTUS @TeamCavuto You want me to just spit back opinions you agree with but that’s not my job. I reported on what both sides said. Again, that’s my job. You disagree with one of the sides. That’s your prerogative.
Trump: “I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke. They said, ‘they’re people.’ They’re not people. These are animals.”
Trump at MS-13 event: “We have the worst immigration laws of any country in the world.”
@SwingWhisperer @POTUS @TeamCavuto You might want to try listening since that’s EXACTLY what I said. It’s the protesters who say otherwise. If you listen, you might actually learn something.
In addition to the protesters, there’s also a small group of Trump supporters here on Long Island. https://t.co/4gD79u6TY5

Mnuchin has been able (so far) to put a trade war “on hold” by successfully freezing out internal rival Peter Navarro. Markets like the approach. Dow futures up about 200 points tonight ahead of Monday trading.
Mnuchin also tells Chris Wallace tariffs are “on hold” #ChinaTrade
Mnuchin says on @FoxNewsSunday there’s a “framework” for a deal with China: “The framework includes their agreement to substantially reduce the trade deficit...”
The Chinese phone...that’s made in the USA. https://t.co/Lr6GBK4sWQ

@comictonypowell @POTUS @Wharton Tony!!!
Key quote from @POTUS on #ChinaTrade talks that are happening now: “Will that be successful? I tend to doubt it. The reason I doubt it is because China has become very spoiled.”
Trump: "As the expression goes, when you're losing $500 billion a year on trade, you can't lose a trade war. You've already lost it."
Now this: DELAWARE JUDGE ORDERS LIFTING OF TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER VS NATIONAL AMUSEMENTS INC IN DISPUTE WITH CBS CORP - and shares of CBS are down 5%
Navarro seems to think Mnuchin is going to cut a "bad deal," but so far @POTUS appears to be going along with Mnuchin's process. Lie He gets an Oval Office meeting later today. #ChinaTrade
On #ChinaTrade - the drama between Navarro &amp; Mnuchin continues. Navarro appears to be back in the mix today, but as of a few minutes ago, he still wasn't involved in the talks. From what I'm told, it's a smaller delegation from both countries. Might change later.

Trump says there will be more discussions tomorrow on trade. And... surprise... he says they will sneak out tomorrow to play golf if possible.
Trump says South Korea and North Korea have his “blessing” to discuss an end to the war.
Trump: “North Korea is coming along.”
Kudlow on Japan being exempt from steel and aluminum tariffs: “It will be under discussion. It’s a key point on the agenda. I don’t want to speculate on the outcome.”
More Kudlow on TPP: “The United States trade discussion with China is really in no way related to the TPP.” He has not expressed optimism today about rejoining.
Kudlow on possibly rejoining TPP: “We will have to be convinced it’s worth it. I don’t think the President is convinced.”

Kudlow to Varney: "Just give us another 24-48 hours. You're going to see what I call a trade coalition of the willing." #TradeWar
The Chinese say there can't be negotiations under "these conditions." Kudlow just told Varney there are "ongoing talks" and "constant communications."
In his @bernieandsid interview, @realDonaldTrump talked about how we "may take a hit" from the trade tension with China. He adds, “I’m not saying there won’t be a little pain ... but we’re going to have a much stronger country when we’re finished, and that’s what I’m all about.’’

This is what we reported on earlier. Be careful who you bash. It might come back to bite you. https://t.co/gFrG34wvj4
The testimony continues this afternoon and Turner Chairman John Martin is next in the hot seat. #ATT #TimeWarner
Petrocelli then turned to news and brought up a quote attributed to Dish founder Charlie Ergen. Ergen said CNN was “must have” programming 20 years ago, but not anymore. Schlicting’s response: “I call that negotiating through the press.”
Schlicting was asked if he knew what percentage of sports programming comes from Turner. He didn’t but accepted company attorney Daniel Petrocelli’s assertion that Turner does NOT broadcast NFL, NHL, NASCAR etc. So, it is really “must have” programming?
The AT&amp;T-Time Warner trial is heating up a bit today. The Sling exec, Warren Schlicting, who said Turner programming is a “must have” is being cross-examined.
For those following the AT&amp;T-Time Warner trial, the first part of the morning session will be sealed. That means us “media types” are sitting in the hallway. At some point, testimony resumes as we wait to eventually hear from Turner Chairman John Martin. More later...
Judge Leon threatened to hold lawyers in contempt if transcripts are leaked like this again. He is, however, allowing Sling exec Warren Schlichting to testify.

It's not yet noon. So far today, we have threats of a trade war, the President's lead lawyer has resigned, and Congress is debating a 22-hundred page spending bill that no one has read. The Dow is down almost 500 points. Happy Thursday.

Wage growth not the issue this month it was last month - 313k jobs added - Wages rose 2.6% from a year earlier in February. The annual wage gain in January was revised down to 2.8% increase.

Trump: “We’re negotiating with Mexico. We’re negotiating with Canada.... If we reach a deal, it’s most likely we won’t be charging those two countries the tariffs.” He then goes on to mention the “close relationship” with Australia. #tariffs
Trump: “We’ll be sending something very beautiful to Mars in the near future.”
Trump: “Rich guys, they love rocket ships. And that’s good...better than us paying for them.”
Trump on Gary Cohn: “He may be a globalist but I still like him.“ Then he goes on, “I have a feeling you’ll be back.”

Ok, now I think we can see what's going on. Wilbur Ross says this is all about national security. That's what Sarah Sanders was saying too. It needs to be to justify the action under Section 232. This is cleanup for the President's NAFTA tweet.

Trump to Latino Coaliton: “We’re trying to have a DACA victory for everybody and the Democrats are nowhere to be found.”
Mnuchin: "We are definitely going to move forward with these tariffs and roll this out very, very quickly." He then says there will be a mechanism in place for the possibility of waivers.
Mnuchin did just mention that "we're going to be careful" and said certain "types of steel" might be exempt. That'll be something to watch.

Markets will be interesting to watch tomorrow. The Cohn departure is the clearest sign yet @POTUS is not backing down on trade. In the past, some have predicted a sell-off if Cohn leaves. Now we’ll see if that happens.
That didn’t sound like a @POTUS who is backing off on tariffs. As he just said, he’s been saying this for 25 years (actually longer). That’s a key point - this is not like other issues for him.
Trump: “If we’re behind against almost every country, then trade wars aren’t so bad.”
Trump: “If the European Union takes off some of the horrible barriers...then we can start talking.”

There was no clear message today on trade from the WH. Eventually, @POTUS said he would approve new tariffs next week. Now the new question becomes: can someone change his mind before then?
Many economists disagree, but @POTUS has continually articulated this same argument for protectionist trade policies. He’s willing to trade higher prices for jobs. Tariffs on the way. https://t.co/2hep1YpyGR
This WSJ story mentions protectionism as one of the factors potentially leading to inflation: "Americans can expect to pay more for...perhaps soon anything containing steel or aluminum because of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump." https://t.co/BrY8d9mDLr

@JonathanHoenig @SimonettiLauren @FoxBusinessAM Good stuff this morning, Jonathan
A lot of people are saying @TheImusShow has booked a huge guest for tomorrow morning at 6:35amET. I’m definitely going to listen.
If my math is right (and I asked Alexa to make sure), the Dow would have had to fall more than 5500 points today to match the ‘87 crash in percentage terms. So, there’s that.
Everyone calm down. We are down less than 900...
Well, when you run up this much, you can be down 1000 points in a day on the Dow. Yes, 1000 points.
The Dow is down about 800 points. We are live from Wall St with @TeamCavuto to sort it all out (or try to) at 4pmET https://t.co/JTSlZHduzz
Well played, Sarge. https://t.co/DxO6f4e6bK

Philly deserves some serious credit for the way they’re going for the win time and time again.
This is unbelievable. Brady has 403 yards passing...and the third quarter isn't even over....and his team is losing.
That's a great catch. I don't know what the rule is (nobody seems to), but I'm glad they called one of these that way. It's been brutal watching so many great efforts erased.
Pretty good game unless you enjoy solid tackling or people who can kick. #SuperBowl
You just get the feeling the missed extra point, leading to the missed conversion, will end up being the difference. After all, it’s the Patriots.

Not much hope here in Washington for bipartisanship. Pelosi just called Trump’s infrastructure plan “lame” and “puny.” She says last night’s speech stooped to a “new low.” #SOTU
That does it for the #SOTU. The 1 hr, 20 minute speech will likely be best remembered for personal stories weaved in by @POTUS
North Korea gets a late mention. “I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.” #SOTU
Not much Democratic reaction to infrastructure comments, which theoretically should be an issue they support. #SOTU

The Patriots are credited for having the “guts” to go for it on 4th down. To me, more coaches should be called out for NOT having the guts to make what’s just a solid decision supported by data.
The tax bill looks more likely to pass. Mike Bloomberg thinks it's a big mistake, arguing corporations don't "need" the money. Big question for next year: Will companies invest, hire and raise wages?  https://t.co/Hs5cPDuLQo

Just a note: I'm on TV tonight, which should be fun, so feel free to join in on @FoxBusiness from 6pm-7pmET
Scaramucci is comfortable on TV, which is what @POTUS wants. Can he handle other aspects of the job? That's the question.
Scaramucci: "The President has really good karma, and the world turns back to him..."
Republicans have questions... https://t.co/WZh6nXiEvS
In isolation, a Sean Spicer resignation doesn't seem shocking. But I doubt many people had July 21st because of @Scaramucci in the pool.
Is he ok? Well, that depends on what you mean. I think he's fine. He's on vacation. It's summer. But don't worry, I'm here w/ @TheGunzShow https://t.co/EdN4RibYK6
Happy Birthday, I-Man! We just played this from @officialdelbert for his big day on Sunday https://t.co/aXlkYpT39v
We will get them back up and running today. Perhaps the station didn't want to highlight @TheGunzShow? I'm not sure, but consider it fixed. https://t.co/M2eYrmORBT

The Post's take on Trump's tweet - I promise it's a quick read. https://t.co/KH0AA13WJi via @nypost
I wonder if today would get this number to 80% https://t.co/PiJeTA3Fks
Biggest QOTD: Will the Mets bring back Bartolo Colon? At least we'd get a few laughs.
Yet another Republican calls out the President as the deputy press secretary says his morning tweets did not go too far. https://t.co/9AWfWYvu4K
Sanders: "That would be a change in tone. Policy." Well, that's the point  - @realDonaldTrump's tweets distract from his own agenda.

.@POTUS confirms he's under investigation and seemingly takes a shot at his Deputy AG. Is he setting up the firing of Rosenstein &amp; Mueller?

@JJansen01690958 Pay attention. That's not the question. The potential investigation is the current one by Mueller, possibly about obstruction.

Bigger story than Comey? The WSJ's data-based assessment of @LIRR incompetence.  https://t.co/ytABttYQfi
I'm starting to detect an increase in tweets like this on bad news days for the WH. https://t.co/Yke71Bupyt
Trying my best. I happen to be filling in for Liz again today on FBN at 3pmET. #PlentyToTalkAbout https://t.co/wgS543FgRe
Comey managed to call @POTUS a liar, not rule out obstruction, admit a leak &amp; throw former AG Lynch under the bus. Time for lunch. #ComeyDay
That was weird...
Finally, we get to #ThatThing. "I'd like to know what the hell that thing is..." - @SenJohnMcCain
Manchin: "Do you believe this will rise to obstruction of justice?" Comey: "I don't know. That's Bob Mueller's job to sort it out."
Paul Ryan: he's "just new to this." So, he's not calling Comey a liar. He's saying @POTUS didn't know any better. What will WH say? https://t.co/AASY3DBJnF
And ... Comey says he thought by having the memos leaked it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
That was something we don't often hear - a leak explained. #ComeyTestimony
I say loyally honest. You say honestly loyal. #Comey #Rubio
So far, the live tweeting is coming from @DonaldJTrumpJr, not @realDonaldTrump #ComeyHearing https://t.co/nqzlCD8UXy
"I took it as a direction." - Comey on interaction w/ @POTUS over Flynn. He refuses to rule out obstruction of justice.
Comey: "I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting and I thought it was important to document it."
"Those were lies, plain and simple." - Comey's take on stories about those inside the FBI losing confidence in him.
Comey opens with the firing instead of reading his statement. He was "confused" by the explanation given by @POTUS
We are all now reminded of this: "I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression..." He has the staring thing down. #ComeyHearing
After his commentary earlier in the week, Neil Cavuto called this morning to talk about Trump &amp; Comey: https://t.co/ZZmazO5SnT @TeamCavuto
Good morning. Join us for #ComeyHearing analysis. @TeamCavuto calls in. Plus, @sidrosenberg on the #NBAFinals https://t.co/CC3nS6Grm0
We are having @CGasparino look into "that thing." You know, that thing. #ComeyTestimony https://t.co/pkb3zdvw7G
Comey does confirm in his prepared testimony he told @POTUS he was not personally under investigation.
Comey's description of his January 27 dinner with @realDonaldTrump: https://t.co/7Qz4albO8J
“Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing.”
Comey: "I told the AG that what had just happened – him being asked to leave while the FBI Director ...remained behind – was inappropriate."
Comey: "I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn ... it was very concerning..."
Comey on @POTUS needing loyalty: "I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed."
There's a lot to go through on the Comey testimony but it seems to confirm most of the reporting we've seen the last few months.
To Whom It May Concern: I will be filling in for @LizClaman today, tomorrow &amp; Friday on #Countdown. That's 3pmET on @FoxBusiness

@Tmansthought @megynkelly really? Give one example. I'm a reporter, not an opinion host. Perhaps you're just not having your POV reiterated?
@jphillipsjack @TeamCavuto @FoxBusiness @CNN not at all, just pointing out there's a huge difference between CNN &amp; BuzzFeed.
