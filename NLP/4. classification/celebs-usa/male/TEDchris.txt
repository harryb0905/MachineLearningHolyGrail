We’ll miss you, Emily.  We’ll also forever be grateful for your life. https://t.co/Vr3hvM5cm4
Best antidote to dismal politics?  An awesome Rube Goldberg machine. You're welcome. https://t.co/gkIj10dw7v
Huge thanks for bringing this to my attention, Ayana. There are 25k TEDx talks every year and we have a backlog in reviewing them. Greta is remarkable, and we're proud to be showcasing her now: https://t.co/0oJg3s4jHo https://t.co/TaTI9CKKyt
The @TEDFellow program is celebrating 10 years of world-changing ideas – check out the remarkable TED2019 cohort! https://t.co/MHYf4jGMsO
Anyone agree? https://t.co/UzuBWuzLcS
This segment well worth watching!  Great to see @kaifulee getting this recognition in US. https://t.co/4izBKDu9Ap
@Lauren240324 Happy to hear that. Good luck w your next talk!
Excited to have The TED Interview coming to Radio 4 https://t.co/7GzWEnE4mw
A little serendipity on my Twitter newsfeed. ;-) https://t.co/kT2YlaQ8Tz
Maybe, just maybe, in 2019 our attention can shift a little to possibility instead of recrimination.  Here's hoping.  Happy New Year, y'all.
@vkhosla Not my experience so far. But glad they’re also in the game.
Better health? Check. Easier to lose weight? Check. Much lower carbon footprint? Check. Avoid needless suffering of countless animals? Triple check. P.S.awesome vegan meat substitutes now available (my fave: Beyond Bugers.)
If you're looking for a truly transformative New Years' Resolution, consider going vegan. (I'm trying. Not fully there yet. But will dial up my commitment Jan 1.) To help your motivation, listen to https://t.co/KGeplMjMgI
Fantastic piece.  Powerful idea here methinks. https://t.co/bHYpwZvjnu
Thanks, Morgan. Def some intensely personal moments there. I'm someone who let go of his childhood faith, but I also worry that the world is in danger of abandoning the moral encouragement -- and community building --  that religion can offer. @ezraklein #TheTEDInterview https://t.co/WK7WaNvanb
We're also running this as a bonus episode on #TheTEDInterview.
Honored to be a guest on @EzraKlein's podcast.  He went deep, asking me about religious faith, meaning, curiosity, skepticism, community, and how on earth we can better listen to each other in this partisan age.  https://t.co/1j4WZu4zPf
@jskardzius @SirKenRobinson In fact that is a smart link that will redirect to google podcasts if opened from an android phone.  We can't think of a better way to link... there are so many platforms in podcasting.
He's truly one of a kind. His comments toward the end -- for teachers, parents and students -- I found deeply inspiring.  https://t.co/hqTlqkpJfq https://t.co/iPpR1bubCn
If you've never watched a TED-Ed animation, you're missing a major source of learning and delight.  Here's a great way to sample!  https://t.co/r7J0JCrkXO
Exciting launch this morning. The new episode of #TheTEDInterview features the one and only @SirKenRobinson, most-viewed TED speaker of all time. He's hilarious and inspiring in equal measure. Come join us for an indepth conversation on education. https://t.co/hqTlqkHkE0
We've agreed a partnership with @CBSThisMorning to dig beyond the headlines and highlight big new ideas next year as they emerge.  I'm excited for this: https://t.co/ahbnbCzITA
This should be fun! https://t.co/LLx5Qhvmi1
A stunning new community space just opened in London! https://t.co/x0D3d2PRqM https://t.co/toU4HIwxOg
@DanTGilbert You'd be top of THAT list, Dan. Funny? check. Surprising? check. Massively educational? check.  Happy making? check.  If anyone's not seen this talk, it's a gem. https://t.co/Su8uhkpaTT  In fact, it's a gem even if you have seen it.  ;-)
There's huge room for debate about this, but... here are my picks for the 10 most significant TED Talks of 2018!  https://t.co/pOCqBPhCeE
"Overconfidence is the enemy of good thinking."  One of many gems from the extraordinary Daniel Kahneman in this new episode of #TheTEDInterview https://t.co/4xvSEzWYzL
Well done, indeed. https://t.co/t7SfqTtFbD
So excited to share this episode of #TheTEDInterview featuring one of the greatest living thinkers, Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. His lifetime of work reveals just how weird and wonderful our minds are. If you're a curious soul, you'll love this. https://t.co/4xvSEzWYzL
Just launched: a super powerful new podcast Species Unite. Wow. If you're brave enough to learn what humans are really doing to animals, you have to subscribe. https://t.co/4VE3aFttqK
Why thank you, @tunein editors. https://t.co/2mk3nwoYgz
Good luck! https://t.co/bkW9xXHeLk
This really was an astonishing conversation with Ray Kurzweil, whose track record as a futurist is unparalleled. He's passionately hopeful about where AI can take us. If you're at all weary of the current wave of tech pessimism, this is a must-listen. https://t.co/thJIaIFz9A
This was an incredible experience using the universal language of music to inspire  a global audience.  The energy and passion of 70,000+ South Africans is something to behold. Kudos to all. https://t.co/B9NxKDlMNe
Welcome @trevornoah! https://t.co/6gW4nbX8L8
@GayleKing @GlblCtzn Bravo, Gayle. You rock!
Excited and proud to be attending #GlobalCitizenFestivalSA  a worldwide celebration of Nelson Mandela’s legacy featuring Beyoncé JayZ and many others. Streaming on YouTube in 2 hrs time.  Bring the world together!
@paulbrisk Thanks Paul. She’s amazing.
Amazing women. https://t.co/VFvHQV0tTt
Powerful quote from a fantastic opening talk at #TEDwomen from @TaranaBurke https://t.co/LJ2gO8AsS9
It can be uncomfortable and challenging to talk about race. But I could listen to the extraordinary @MellodyHobson for hours. I loved hearing her make the case for being color brave. Please share this episode with anyone you know who wants a fairer world. https://t.co/93yN347zNq
There's no org more effective at tackling the injustice of poverty. Empowerment, not charity. https://t.co/YrWx9L4TG8
As families gather across the US for Thanksgiving tomorrow... and in some cases nervously worry about their political differences...  here's a wonderful talk to help you make the best of the season. https://t.co/xvuuwh7SIM
Thanks, all. Among many other things, Zoe loved to scuba dive. Her name means 'life'. And the sculpture is inspired by a DNA molecule. So you can read the whole thing as a kind of circle of life story.
I'd like to share a site deeply meaningful to me: an underwater memorial to my daughter Zoe, streaming live from Cozumel, Mexico. The beautiful sculpture by @misssnailpail is slowly growing coral and attracting fish. Just one way Zoe inspires me every day. https://t.co/9kCDqmbz2U
I really, really want you to meet Robin Steinberg, the driving force behind @bailproject. The injustice she's tackling will take your breath away. Check out https://t.co/7vg9ATb2t5
This is majestic, awe-inspiring. Both in its ambition level, and execution.   Set aside half an hour today and watch this with someone you love. https://t.co/1l3AEqkcX4
@mashable Black mirror!
New episode of #TheTEDInterview featuring the dazzling intellect of @sapinker. I challenged him on whether his arguments for progress are undercut by climate, inequality, AI risks, our current political malaise, and more. Have to say, he's persuasive https://t.co/6hZXV3O2X7
P.S. ...to do this, click on 'view in iTunes' and then 'write a review'
I have a huge favor to ask, dear Twitter friends. If you've had a chance to listen to an episode of #TheTEDInterview, would you consider leaving a rating and review here on iTunes? https://t.co/CNkhFf6wQw  It really helps. Thank you, thank you. ;-)
@Apes2Angels Have you tried?  I don't say it's easy.  But at heart, we're all humans. We all dream. We all love. We all bleed. Should be possible to find common ground.
TEDx organizers take my breath away. Here's an image from an event yesterday where 3000 people (out of 31,000 who applied) packed an opera house in Buenos Aires.  And the event was on TV nationwide. Amazing. https://t.co/4hCIyrYtyG
Do you want to see a world where people seek to reach out to each other across divides? Then I fervently urge you to share this talk. It's astonishing.   https://t.co/P42UaUX777  #hope
....and for my nonAmerican friends interested in how to make sense of Islam in today's divided world, I offer the same episode. I was so impressed with how @DMogahed shared her faith and responded to my challenges. https://t.co/bfbdLkkiYy
For my American friends, here's something to listen to while waiting in line to vote. The remarkable, bridging words of @DMogahed in episode 4 of #TheTEDInterview https://t.co/bfbdLkkiYy
This is a big deal. Bio data explosion ahead. https://t.co/6e0L1CteKf
The brilliant animation of @wearecognitive somehow turned these questions I mused over into a TED-Ed blockbuster.  13m views and counting https://t.co/EfZZqyROLI
(Podcast backlog dept.)  Need cheering up? This is a truly fantastic conversation with @LaurieSantos who makes the non-intuitive science of happiness completely approachable... and potentially life-changing. https://t.co/JnBnuCz9i1
Also, the four letters of "four" when rearranged spell "frou" which is exactly 50% of my favorite electronic duo Frou Frou. Their only album was released in 2002. Add together the numerals. And you get... FOUR.  The universe is magic. https://t.co/w6dD5R5wLB
@reasonvalues @SamHarrisOrg I hope not. Might there not be a middle way?  Start with respect... then make your case vigorously.  I'm 100% on board for a reasoned conversation. Just want to give it its best shot.
So glad you enjoyed, Stuart. https://t.co/lxbFkrkA1U
@mitchell_jed I think that's exactly right. In one way it's kind of a hack around our strange human psychology. But it's worth trying.
@mrgump7 Wow.  Thank you. That's what powerful ideas do, I guess.  It's a journey we're all on.
@PaulDerrico They'll definitely have to have some kind of moral code at some point. Or we'll never trust them. Over the next decade this will become a huge issue.
Really thoughtful response, Ernst. Thank you. https://t.co/GP2pHewesN
An amazing talk. Riveting. https://t.co/Hr3LbTw1w3
@Glen_Byleveld @SamHarrisOrg Heh. nice 1.
I'm curious what you make of this conversation. It began with Sam's argument that moral values can be derived from science and reason... and then morphed into an intense discussion about how to communicate across religious borders.  We have to figure this out, right? https://t.co/em20T17A71
Excited to unveil episode 3 of #TheTEDInterview with @SamHarrisOrg. Can morality be as objective as science? A lot hangs on this question. Listen here: https://t.co/sPn2qDBHvK https://t.co/JqFC5S5wuA
Congrats to the speakers and organizers of Zeitgeist18. A really wonderful conference. Have enjoyed every minute.
The ideas of @DavidDeutschOxf  can really change how you see the world.  I LOVED this conversation. https://t.co/x2xGQ6VCeS
Episode 2 of #TheTEDInterview is live. An exploration of the astonishing ideas of @DavidDeutschOxf. https://t.co/2w41wjJeKH
These shoes are unbelievably comfortable.  Wearing them most days. https://t.co/yQ5Bkh92gf
@AuthorSelby Just share why you’re passionate about books. And why books matter more than ever
Here's how #TheTEDInterview differs from the amazing @TEDRadioHour.  Thanks for the Q, @cheddar. https://t.co/mnScp53v5i
I love the format for CBS This Morning. Rapid-fire questioning from four smart &amp; curious hosts.  This was fun. https://t.co/ey0dwoDSyd
Beautiful post. https://t.co/tUso1FOxnq
Surprised and delighted to see The TED Interview at #10 here: https://t.co/Tx9cGx2pg8  Thank you, kind followers. I think you did something there. ;-)
If you know someone creative, the first half of this podcast is for them. If you know someone who's lost someone dear to them, the last half is for them. In both halves @GilbertLiz is amazing. https://t.co/SCFkGO6da6
I love that quote. https://t.co/PAKcuol8WM
@anoureddini From Apple iTunes, or wherever you get your podcasts
@JaZzminesaif Not immediately. Just wherever you get your podcasts.
#TheTEDInterview is an exciting new way for us to offer you a front-row seat to some of the day’s most fascinating and challenging conversations. I’m excited to hear what you think! Now tell me: What TED speaker should I interview next?
Each week I’ll be in conversation with a new TED speaker, including @SirKenRobinson, @SamHarrisOrg, Mellody Hobson, and more. #TheTEDInterview episodes will be roughly 40 minutes, available every Tuesday on @ApplePodcasts or wherever you listen.
So many remarkable people have given @TEDTalks over the past few years. In #TheTEDInterview, we get to dive much deeper than was possible in their original talk, allowing them to further explain, illuminate and, in some cases, defend their thinking.
I’m thrilled to share with you the first episode of my new podcast, #TheTEDInterview. This week I talked with beloved TED speaker and author @GilbertLiz about creativity and courage — and also about grief. Her words really affected me. You can listen here: https://t.co/MsNbJnqSYf
Wow. This is a powerful analysis of the current political divide. https://t.co/LemKd8dWoO  It makes you think a new narrative for the central groups could change everything. Any suggestions for who is best articulating THAT?!
12 hours away: the launch of our new podcast The TED Interview. Each episode is: one hour, one speaker, in depth. I've LOVED recording these conversations.  Can't wait to share...
It's been such an honor to have Paul as part of the TED community the past two decades. Despite being so smart and so powerful, he was extraordinarily humble, and contributed to numerous ideas and projects with zero fanfare. We'll miss him terribly. RIP, Paul. https://t.co/95AF5jwJjG
On Tuesday we're launching a new podcast I'm really excited about. Each hour-long episode of The TED Interview features a single TED speaker, so we get to explore their thinking in much greater depth. Episode 1: the remarkable Elizabeth Gilbert. More here https://t.co/ZTlILi6LNJ
Financial health warning. There are some truly nasty stings out there. https://t.co/8Nj6Lh43sj
Courageous and beautiful.   If you can, watch his speech on the https://t.co/XAl9cQ516F stream. Like nothing you've ever seen. https://t.co/vX7tdUBEIZ
Yusaku Maezawa might just be one of the most creative, generous, visionary and inspiring people on the planet. I'm blown away. However else the next few years play out, 2023 will bring us hope.  Thank you, Yusaku. #spacex
It's not all hate out there. Tomorrow, a global army of volunteers in 156 countries will embark on a day of cleaning up trash. Inspiring. https://t.co/e6mYOgDqE8
This is a spectacular talk, asking a really profound and important question... and delivering beautifully argued answers.    https://t.co/gDKiBei7Af
Neil led me on a long, winding journey through many ideas, both big-concept and intensely personal.  But that's what books are for. https://t.co/uXJ5wobFlF
Two of the most inspirational people you will ever see   https://t.co/4gP2Tqxyuj
Just 12 days left to apply for a program that can connect you with an incredible global community and transform your work's impact. https://t.co/62GKjrFwMh
This such a powerful talk on AI, China vs US, and the future of work. @kaifulee offers an ingenious, compelling and ultimately hopeful way to think about these issues. https://t.co/EHLAa1u1KM
Well played, Croatia. You deserved the win.  For England, this about sums it up... But it was fun while it lasted. https://t.co/gjkXmRnXMf
I admit it, I'm excited for today's semi-final.  Best way to set the mood? This is still the best/maddest football song of all time. https://t.co/RpWdmj0kY6  #itscominghome
There's exciting momentum in all of the Audacious projects unveiled at TED this year. https://t.co/CsWgmsPPd3  When people pool efforts, amazing things are possible.
Caroline and a valiant coalition of public health heroes are working to end the thousands-year-old disease of agonizing blindness: trachoma. https://t.co/RqUbxwQNbG So proud of the TED Community for backing her with &gt;$50m of support. You can join!
You can't overstate the impact Netflix has had -- and will have -- on the world of entertainment. Here's my interview with its brilliant CEO @reedhastings who Barry Diller described as the most interesting man in media today. https://t.co/Sc1cJsiubq
Just finished reading an alarming @NYTimes article on my iPhone about fears of an insect armageddon. The story included 3 different ads all offering, I kid you not, insecticides. Next up, a school shooting story funded by ads for guns?
Simple question. If there were one person you'd LOVE to see give a TED Talk, who would that be?    Bonus question: why?
An extraordinary talk pulsing with laughter, tears, and deep wisdom about life --  and about death. Watch it tonight with someone you love.  https://t.co/rN3ZTr95Ee  Emily, what a gift you gave us all.
Transcript of a stunning commencement speech by @jnovogratz on four steps to build character. https://t.co/DstZT8eQlr  I wish every graduate could read this.  Every human, even.
Beware the dangers of a seductive, new, data-powered fascism! Chilling talk from one of the great synthesizing minds of our time @harari_yuval https://t.co/mijv9dw9YA  Oh, and it was delivered via HOLOGRAM
Do you know someone (or an org) with a truly bold idea for social impact who deserves significant funding (&gt;$25 million). Applications are open at https://t.co/Rw9PvhTZX7   Dream big!
Using biological systems as her reference, @KateRaworth makes an incredibly persuasive argument for shifting away from growth toward 'doughnut economics'. Huge talk. https://t.co/sGvIq6Nf0T
Could one person help save the lives of millions of babies? Turns out, yes. https://t.co/U9O6B4hWhr
Probably NSFW but such a powerful talk. Was a big talking point at #TED2018  https://t.co/JWr2l5pYe0
Nicely done @MrVikas https://t.co/ueeBVryI5U
If only schools could do THIS. It would change everything. https://t.co/aDB2UvCcRy
Captivating talk by Frances Frei, who was hired to restore trust at Uber. She's remarkable. Please share with anyone you know in a challenging leadership role! https://t.co/pA7zj9pyLV
@TrevorFSmith @sapinker So... you don't believe that powerful ideas are for everyone? That good news should be shared, no matter its source? Part of our current crisis has been caused by people worrying about the wrong things. Facts matter.
It's obvious from the news we read every day that the world's in a truly terrible place, right? @sapinker dares to disagree. It's one of the key debates of our age. If we can understand progress, we can figure out how to continue it. Blockbuster talk. https://t.co/JgQxa9y2yv
Kudos to #Homeland writers for a partisan-bridging presidential speech every citizen dreams of hearing one day. Incredible.
Are conversations possible across barriers of identity and outrage? @DylanMarron gave an incredibly important (and hopeful) talk at #TED2018 https://t.co/4k2zgFD7LF
Dream big! https://t.co/grJrwZHuxV
8/8  If you care to understand more deeply issues of race, injustice, incarceration… and hope for the future… I cannot urge you strongly enough to book your ticket to Montgomery. https://t.co/yRgUjvEVQP
7/8 The memorial is accompanied by a museum that uses viscerally powerful images, videos and reconstructions to reveal how the racial injustices of America's past have morphed into the shocking injustices of today’s legal system.
6/8 It’s extraordinarily thrilling to see how quickly that vision has become real. The emotion, excitement and sense of history in a pre-opening celebration last night was palpable.
5/8 Just two years ago architect Michael Murphy of @MASSDesignLab shared his and Bryan's vision of the memorial at TED at the moving climax of this talk. https://t.co/RcCAu6bRhR
4/8 The memorial is the vision of Bryan Stevenson of @eji_org who won the longest standing ovation in TED’s history with this epic talk from 2012. https://t.co/FgKEP9TweG
3/8 The growing gaps in the set of memorials outside will, over coming years, be a powerful marker of progress toward reconciliation. The unclaimed, a shameful reminder of how long the process takes.
2/8 Each hanging column records the lynchings that took place in an individual county. Outside an identical set are available to be claimed by those counties to become a local memorial. https://t.co/gFWBx4kZAQ
1/8 I’m in Montgomery, Alabama for the opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice. It’s deeply moving, and could inspire the healing of ancient wounds in the US, county by county. https://t.co/C4AZ3YX5r2
I got the chance to interview president of @SpaceX  Gwynne Shotwell at #TED2018 a few days ago. The future she's helping usher in is astonishing https://t.co/WBfEboXDip
Courage and wisdom personified...  https://t.co/o92FXiqbhy
Inspiring work. Powerful talk. Thank you, Teresa https://t.co/AQX5h2D7qZ
Bill, your support means a lot. Thank you. https://t.co/BC3naGDgEH
Truly beautiful news. Thank you public health heroes. https://t.co/478udYwx8w
Was really fun interviewing Ray... https://t.co/4Erl6w2xed
57. So many of our public spaces have failed to tap into people's personal experience of race, culture, inequality. By paying attention to those things, we can create vibrant new urban landscapes. @hdhooddesign #TED2018
56. One key to success in media is to understand the difference between people's idealized values and their revealed values. Which will you optimize for? @reedhastings #TED2018
55. Does technology necessarily serve just the interests of the elites? No! Three stories from China show how the masses can be empowered through online education, new business potential and low-cost access to transport. @garyliu #TED2018
54. The key to successful growth for an organization? Set clear objectives aligned deeply with your underlying mission. Then create key indicators to track progress toward those goals. Measure what matters! @johndoerr #TED2018
53. The origins of theater lay in democratizing ideas and building community. We need that today more than ever. The success of Hamilton shows what's possible. Let's encourage an explosion of local theater across America and beyond! Oskar Eustis #TED2018
52. Why do we write off the world's invisible people? Allowing illiterate women access to their own bank accounts enabled them to transform their lives. With empowerment, the world's poor become tomorrow's hope. @chetnavsinha #TED2018
51. Grief is a journey. With time, love, and support, miraculously you can eventually find a way back to experiencing beauty, even joy. Jason Rosenthal, subject of Amy Krouse-Rosenthal's article "You May Want to Marry My Husband" #TED2018
50. Dueling identities are the source of so much discord. Why don't we find a new narrative and embrace our many identities as valid parts of who we are? Then they become opportunities to connect in unexpected ways with others. @rebecahwang #TED2018
49. Smart home devices are sending shocking amounts of your data back to the cloud. Make sure you know what you're getting into. @kashhill @suryamattu #TED2018
48. Illustrations have to be placed at the sweet point of an "abstractometer". Too abstract and they're meaningless. Too literal, and they're ridiculous. In the middle, the possibilities to intrigue and delight are limitless. @abstractsunday #TED2018
47. There's a new generation of prosthetics designed to connect directly into your nervous and muscular systems. This means the new limbs feel like part of you. The potential for human enhancement beckons. Hugh Herr #TED2018
46. In sexual situations, our bodies can betray us. Here's a crucial principle: do not confuse physical response with consent. @emilynagoski #TED2018
45. New life forms can now be synthesized in a 3D printer, from computer code and the basic components of DNA. Hello, bio-teleportation! You could send a printer to Mars and beam up the code for an organism that will flourish there. #TED2018
44. Reproducing life forms have been created from enhanced DNA-like molecules containing SIX base pairs instead of nature's four, a major scientific breakthrough. What stories could be written with those extra letters? @RomesbergLab #TED2018
43. Radical new holography technology, contained in a lightweight skullcap, could deliver hi-res images of brain activity at super low cost. This enables not just a revolution in medical scanning, but the ability to see people's thoughts, feelings and dreams. @mljmljmlj #TED2018
42. Our civilization is built on trust, and trust itself rests on three pillars: empathy, logic and authenticity. When trust is broken, first figure out which pillar needs repair. There are different strategies for each. Frances Frei #TED2018
41. When you pick up the phone and call someone who insulted you online, something amazing can happen. Human connection. Empathy. Vulnerability in front of someone you disagree with doesn't strip you of power. It enhances it. @dylanmarron #TED2018
40. There's art created for spectators, and then there's art that demands full immersion, physical risk and a lifetime of commitment. If we embrace THAT form of art, our bodies — and our spirits — will soar. @dark1run #TED2018
39. Can we take AI beyond the traditional machine-learning architectures? An 18-year-old is trying to build AIs with background knowledge, abstract thinking and imagination, a key step in building machines that think more like us. @kvfrans #TED2018
Here's the first of our five Audacious Projects that I believe our community will fund and execute. An extraordinary response to a shocking injustice: https://t.co/tpUklKuEPQ @TheAudaciousPrj
38. Web services can make all the difference between someone radicalizing and being rescued from that radicalization. It's urgent we understand this so that we can use technology to nurture empathy and aid those most in danger. @yasmind @TED2018
37. By optimizing for sustained user attention, YouTube's algorithms have begun taking people into rabbit holes of ever more radical content. It's dangerous for us and even more so for our kids. A fix is urgently needed. @jamesbridle #TED2018
36. Clinging onto a vertical cliff with just fingers and toes, a free climber quickly learns the difference between mastery and reckless risk. Conquering danger through carefully attained mastery is profoundly satisfying. The other way? Just don't. @AlexHonnold #TED2018
35. There are mind-boggling new ways to use fingerprints in forensic work. It's now not just the pattern of the print — you can harvest actual molecules from it and discover if the crime suspect was taking drugs or had touched something else. @SimonaFrancese #TED2018
34. Organs harvested from pigs could one day end the long waitlists for organ transplants. CRISPR technology is allowing us to edit pig genomes so that this can be safe for humans. @eGenesisBio #TED2018
33. An architect must be a builder, a humanist and a poet. We strive for a universal beauty that will inspire the world, one person at a time. @RPBWARCHITECTS #TED2018
32. Machine learning is now allowing AI to compose compelling music that can be customized to an individual's needs of the moment. Movies have custom soundtracks. Perhaps we will soon add them to our personal lives, too. @aivatechnology #TED2018
31. The key to figuring out how humans will survive the coming AI explosion is to focus on human compassion. This will be the key to redefining what type of human work and meaning will thrive in the future. @kaifulee #TED2018
30. It's time to bring Wizards and Prophets together. Wizards believe human ingenuity means no limits to growth. Prophets demand restraints. But there's exciting common ground they can explore! @CharlesCMann #TED2018
29. There's a huge opportunity for ocean conservation by focusing on the high seas, where new satellite data reveals that fishing serves absolutely no one's interests. Let's make it all a protected global commons! @Enric_Sala #TED2018
28. The tiniest things are the invisible drivers of our world. Newly-discovered micro-organisms in the ocean power much of the world's photosynthesis, converting CO2 to oxygen. We better understand these critters! @ChisholmLab_MIT #TED2018
27. Air travel is entering a new era of local ride-hopping thanks to affordable electric power and sophisticated autopilot. Forget airports. Just use an app to summon your personal flying machine. @RodinLyasoff #TED2018
26. Choking air pollution has given China all the motivation it needs to make bold plans for a shift to sustainable energy. What's happening there offers real hope on climate change, though there's much to be done. @ecoangelhsu #TED2018
25. We're making huge progress in technologies which EXTRACT CO2 from the atmosphere. Synthetic forests could be a powerful new tool in fighting climate change. Jennifer Wilcox. #TED2018
24. Radiative cooling is a new nano-technology to reduce global warming. It converts heat into thermal radiation that can escape through our greenhouse gases into outer space! @aaraman #TED2018
23. Morality evolved in an era of zero growth. We need fresh moral thinking to imagine the greatest good in this era of unlimited potential. One suggestion: focus hard on humanity's long-term survival, or risk switching out the lights on billions of lives. @willmacaskill #TED2018
22. We may have miscalculated the chances that the universe is teeming with life. There are multiple, deeply challenging hurdles in the way of intelligent life developing. A new look at the odds suggests we might be alone. Stephen Webb #TED2018
21. What are we to make of the giant spinning obelisk ‘Oumuamua, the first astronomical object we've seen that clearly came from outside of our solar system? An exciting scientific mystery. Karen J. Meech #TED2018
20. Video gaming can now offer rich, interactive, cinema-realistic stories with incredibly complex alternative narratives. A new era of intense story-telling is upon us. And you are the story creator. David Cage #TED2018
19. Bridges bring together peak engineering with peak artistry. Today's bridges inspire, but just wait for what's coming. @i_firth #TED2018
18. Let's create more imaginative cities by building on new technologies and local history, instead of just rolling out global monoculture cities designed for needs of automobiles, not people. @VishaanNYC #TED2018
17. The art on display at the annual Burning Man festival may offer a clue to the future of human creativity. It's wildly imaginative, stunningly ambitious, and powerfully collaborative. Nora Atkinson #TED2018
If change-makers are encouraged to make truly bold plans, they're capable of transformative change. The spectacular growth in the impact achieved by @OneAcreFund proves it. Let's dream bigger! #AudaciousProject #TED2018
.@GirlTrek has inspired 100,000 African American women to walk together — for health, and for community. What if they could grow that 10x? You'd have an unstoppable movement for change. Let's back them! #AudaciousProject #TED2018
A surprisingly large proportion of the greenhouse gas effect comes from methane. But new technology allows us to spot methane leaks from space. Let's launch a satellite to do this! This single project could cut global warming by 10%. @FredKrupp #AudaciousProject #TED2018
Trachoma is an agonizing way to go blind &amp; has plagued us for thousands of years, impacting millions. But we know how to end it. So let's do it. Here's a plan to eliminate it from 12 more countries, en route to totally vanquishing it. @CarolineAHarper #AudaciousProject #TED2018
Much of the world's biomass exists in the ocean depths, too dark and dangerous for us to explore. New tech is changing that. Let's launch a major scientific research project to understand the alien world down there. Our future could depend on it. @WHOI #AudaciousProject #TED2018
Let's create a national bail fund to prevent the shocking injustice of a system in which thousands of unconvicted citizens go to jail and see their lives fall apart, just because they're too poor to pay bail. @bailproject #AudaciousProject #TED2018
A plan to empower community health workers worldwide has dramatically scaled thanks to bold support from visionary donors. @rajpanjabi #AudaciousProject #TED2018

16. Reusable rocketry is opening up astonishing possibilities including, within a decade, travel to the other side of the world in just an hour via space. Mars beckons. @SpaceX #TED2018

13. We have so much to learn from the octopus! Most of our robots have hard surfaces, but if we built soft robots, inspired by nature, we could enable much better, safer interaction with ourselves and the world. Giada Gerboni #TED2018
12. It's possible to turn any human into a digital model that looks + sounds exactly like them + can be programmed to say anything. Scary, but w/ the individual's approval, this will allow an explosion of creativity + amplification of great voices. Supasorn Suwajanakorn #TED2018

9. It's crazy that we still measure progress by GDP. We should distinguish physical production, which must be managed within sustainable boundaries, from dematerialized growth. Yes to creativity and renewal. No to unlimited consumption! @KateRaworth #TED2018
8. A new generation of bio-sensors + machine learning can figure out our internal mental states and emotions. This could allow technology to be empathetic, to know our needs. What could possibly go wrong? ;-) @poppycrum #TED2018
7. Fascism makes you see yourself and your country as the most beautiful, important things in the world. That's why it is dangerous. But the past won't come back in the same form. Dictatorships of the future will be built on control of data. Beware. @harari_yuval #TED2018
Over the last year, what has been your dominant emotion about the future? #TED2018
6. We've deceived ourselves into a dangerous gloom. When you look at the actual data, the world is showing truly astonishing progress. We need a new narrative, anchored in the Enlightenment. @sapinker #TED2018
5. Politicians muzzle science at their peril. It is not just another opinion. It's humanity's best attempt at understanding the world. @KirstyDuncanMP #TED2018
4. We must stop suppressing the voices of those we deeply disagree with. By listening to them, we will learn how to better combat their ideas. And we may also be surprised by how much common ground we have. @ZacharyRWood #TED2018
3. The dream of a world of free Internet services for all has turned into a nightmare because of technologies that addict and deceive. An anchoring principle for the future: Don't manipulate people. Jaron Lanier #TED2018
2. Re-read your history! The US 2nd amendment sought to allow for well-regulated militias, not unchecked arming of individuals. When will this madness end? Diane Wolk-Rogers, a history teacher who witnessed the shooting of 17 at her school in Parkland. #TED2018
1. The fury that so many women feel in this cultural moment is legitimate and will change society. Men, come and be allies. @TraceeEllisRoss #TED2018
Discomfort is not always bad. You could even say it's a proxy for progress. If you embrace it, you can start to do something about it. #TED2018
We're entering the Age of Amazement. Thrilling amazing... And scary amazing. We can be inspired by the former, and motivated by the latter. #TED2018
#TED2018 has started! There’s truly amazing content coming. Over the next few days, I’m going to try to share with you my quick encapsulation of the big ideas being unveiled. A week of wisdom in a twitter thread. This will be fun.
Exciting news! TED's mobile app is Apple's App of the Day! https://t.co/AroEBhLvH1 @appstore #TED2018 https://t.co/NG68y3E7qI
@felixsalmon @TEDTalks We love that project. It delivers one big winner.  Here five projects annually will be supported.
@JacobsonOleg @TEDTalks Start by joining our live stream next week. It shd be special evening.
Thank you, and get dreaming.
Many thanks to the remarkable partners who joined forces with TED to make @TheAudaciousPrj possible: @SkollFoundation, @VirginUnite, Scott Cook &amp; Signe Ostby, the Dalio Foundation, Laura &amp; John Arnold, @ELMAPhilanthro, @macfound, @gatesfoundation, @BridgespanGroup and more.
We believe there’s a chance that something transformative could happen. There’s a chance that some of the world’s changemakers may be encouraged to dream more creatively and more boldly than ever before, to truly explore what humanity is capable of.
To support these world-changing ideas, or to submit your own, go to https://t.co/8J1a0QXCgf. Anyone is welcome to apply and make their case. The only fundamental rules are: Dream big. And then show us how that dream can come true.
It is not just your money that can help: it’s also your ideas, your encouragement and your ability to spread the word. All of the projects will need a committed community of supporters, cheering them on through thick and thin.
You can watch their talks and the launch of the Audacious Project on April 11 at 5pm PST on https://t.co/8J1a0QXCgf.
Our first 5 projects range from ocean exploration to rethinking bail reform. Their creators will share their dreams as TED Talks at #TED2018, and we invite everyone to join us in helping to make their dreams real.
Does it work? Yes. We piloted this process twice, researching hundreds of ideas and presenting the most worthy to a small groups of donors. More than $250 million was committed to these projects.
3) Present them to the world in a single moment that provides as much visibility and excitement as possible, and invite people to support them… together.
2) Vet the ideas to find those with genuine potential for scale and impact. Select the best and help shape them into actionable, multi-year plans that are both viable and sustainable.
The Audacious Project will do three things to spark change at scale: 1) Invite the world’s greatest change agents to dream like they’ve never dreamed before and create ideas that are truly audacious.
The Audacious Project is our attempt to imagine what an IPO for the nonprofit world might look like, and to create a way for private individuals to pool resources and work together in the service of entrepreneurs who could change the world.
This is why some of the world’s best-positioned changemakers, both doers and funders, feel forced to give up on their biggest dreams, and the possibility of creating truly audacious change is left underexplored. We want to change that.
Nonprofit fundraising has a problem. It’s fundamentally more challenging than raising funds for for-profit solutions. Nonprofit initiatives are often funded one donor at a time, one year at a time. It’s a deeply inefficient and endlessly frustrating.
For the past three years, a group of foundations and individuals has been working with us at TED to design a new model for turning the bold ideas of brilliant social entrepreneurs into large-scale action and change.
I’m thrilled to finally share a huge announcement. Today @TEDTalks is launching a new initiative that aims to revolutionize how we change the world. It’s called The Audacious Project: Collaborative Philanthropy for Bold Ideas.
Today's announcement. https://t.co/FzJCA2Wv45 Let's back big ideas together! Kudos and thanks to our amazing partners Skoll, Virgin Unite, MacArthur, ELMA, Dalio Foundation, Gates Foundation, Bridgespan and more. #AudaciousProject
After several years in development, we’re truly excited to unveil The Audacious Project, a new model for empowering the world’s change-makers.  If you believe in the power of dreams for a better future, please share this! https://t.co/GiwG5CUtOA https://t.co/j86FBE6nC0
In three hours' time, we're unveiling a project some of us have been working on under the radar for the past four years. It's really a dream come true. And its goal is to help make other peoples' big dreams come true.  Check back soon!

@mashbusiness Thanks, all. Over and out!  #BizChats
A8. If you can speak with friends over dinner, you can be a public speaker. Have the courage to raise your voice... and good luck! #BizChats
A8. Always ask yourself: Do I have something worth saying? And be honest! If the answer is no, wait until you do. #BizChats
A7. There’s no product or app that can beat sharing your planned talk with a small group of trusted friends. #BizChats
A6. Making it all about me, my product, my plans...a talk should be a gift, not a take. Lead with your ego, you’ll lose the crowd. #BizChats
@thedavepepper Hmm.. ideas worth sharing, carefully crafted to be understandable, accessible, compelling. #BizChats https://t.co/SrwP401ny4
Nailed it. You win. ;-) https://t.co/2noG9glMAf
@dah_nsi @mashbusiness Here's one @dah_nsi Thanks for asking. https://t.co/ofPyxS0lJa #BizChats
A5. Fear of public speaking is there for a reason: it’s fight or flight! Use that adrenaline to motivate your preparation. #BizChats
@aweyenberg  Refuse. Or sabotage. I know you can do it!  #bizchats
Exactly so. https://t.co/YfTjblxh68
A4. A talk is a journey. That means you start where the audience is. Every step of the journey has to be one they WANT to take. #BizChats
A3. Plan to be yourself. If you’re creative, be creative. If you’re funny, be funny. (If you’re full of ego, be someone else.) #BizChats
A3. Two different ways to prepare: Script the full talk. Or speak ‘in the moment’ from bullet-points. Benefits and traps to each! #BizChats
@nadiagoodman A lot of us get nervous. It's OK. Many of the best speakers are introverts. Check out @SusanCain. #BizChats
A3. The answer is there in the question: prepare! Musicians rehearse, athletes practice… “winging it” isn’t a recipe for success. #BizChats
So true. But introverts can play too. You don't have to fake high energy! Be authentic. https://t.co/4rdOyLgzZJ
A2. The best speakers commit to giving, not taking. Don’t boast, sell or promote. Instead GIVE your audience an idea they can use. #BizChats
A2. There’s only one true essential to public speaking. Have something worth saying. #BizChats
Q2. Anyone who talks as well as @AdamMGrant ?  I mean, have you SEEN his TED Talk? #BizChats
@tyarde @AdamMGrant @mashbusiness  Hi, Tiffany. Here are 3. Rambling (lack of prep), over-selling, and style over substance. Steer clear!
A1. It’s of no use at all… apart from sharing a vision, sparking collaboration, inspiring your team to care... ;) #BizChats
Bingo. Me too. #BizChats https://t.co/8JXuGS1P8b
@mashbusiness Hi all, nice to meet you. As curator of TED, I get to see hundreds of fine speakers in action. Happy to share their wisdom!

@sredlums The families of many of the other 150k who will die today will feel the same grief. We focus on the dramatic over the fixable.

@InsiderThreats "There is a LOT of tragedy every day"  I think that was my point. We tend to focus only on the dramatic.
@webpointzero It is. But I bet there are stories in the other 150k deaths yesterday that also deserve attention. we lean to the dramatic
@getoffyourknees Not intended that way, John. That crash a tragedy. But we ignore so many other things we cd fix because there's less drama
@moneyries Yes, it is. But you think there aren't stories in the 150k other deaths? We lean to the dramatic. And ignore stuff we cd fix.
@mikebrondbjerg you miss my point, pal. it's a tragedy. but there are countless other tragedies we could fix that go ignored. That's all.
150,000 people die each day. But if 100 die in an airplane it hijacks world's attention for weeks. Here we go again... #BrainBug
