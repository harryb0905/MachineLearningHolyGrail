Oh and Michael Jordan never did come out of retirement. Lol
If Michael Jordan, the best to ever play the game, can’t finish his career with Chicago, what does that tell you? Same goes with Pippen, Ewing, Malone and the list goes on
Trades, Free Agencies shouldn’t be taken personal, the NBA is a business
I remember when Bryan Colangelo and Sam Mitchell told me I wasn’t getting traded from Toronto, and Sam saying “if Micheal Jordan comes out of retirement is the only way we trading you”  Literally the next day I was traded to Milwaukee.
There’s no loyalty in the @Nba. I learned this pretty quickly #getyourmoney #itsabusiness

Until a group of players or schools get together and say we are boycotting March Madness, or the season nothing will change.  And the @NCAA will continue to make BILLIONS of DOLLARS while they suspend kids by taking money or gifts to support their families.
I was suspended my first 8 games of the season in 2003- 2004 season at UCONN.  I did something my family couldn’t afford to do.  I wonder how much money the NCAA made in 2004, the year we won the championship? 🤔
Yes take a stand  Players.  If you want change this must happen.  The NCAA is a business, without the players there’s no business to be made. https://t.co/k5SxGj6fLU

The odds are against us but that's what #MarchMadness is all about. UConn needs to come thru strong this 2nd half and get back in this game.
I can't front, Kanas controlled the whole 1st half. They came with a lot of energy. UConn faces its biggest halftime deficit all season.
@_MWill They putting the clamps on us bro. What up doe fam!
Damn! Not a good start for my UConn squad. They've been scoreless for the last 6-minutes. Credit to @KUHoops defense, they're tough.

Wow, why not a draw.  It was a draw
It's been a fantastic fight, Maidana is looking good, this round will decide the fight.
Floyd is winning the fight but very very close
Great round for Mayweather
Maidana looking strong this round, super close fight
Very strong round for Floyd
Mayweather got the 6, very close fight
Maidana is holding his own, Mayweather is rattled, but still poised
Mayweather is bleeding
Mayweather is so fast, age hasn't slow him down at all. Maidana making it entertaining tho
Mayweather got the second round
Good fight thus far, Maidana might punch his way out this fight
Floyd looks poised tho
Maidana throwing good punches, I never seen Mayweather like this in a while
This might be a silly question who you got winning Mayweather or Maidana?
