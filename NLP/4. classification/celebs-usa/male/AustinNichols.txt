I'm so afraid that these black workers did not have proper breathing gear.  Shame on BP!!!!!
The mean white man yelled at me to "get away from his workers.".
They were scared when we approached with a camera and yelled for their "boss" to get us away, Who was a mean white man.
When I was down at the gulf, we encountered many clean up crews, contracted by BP. They were all black and not allowed to speak to us!!!
I just looked at a box of crayons. Plum and sepia???  When I was a kid, it was purple and brown.

Way to go zach and kelly. Slater and jesse. Lisa and screech. Mr. Belding.
#savedbythebell was really ahead of the game. Remember, "STOP THE DRILLING. STOP THE OIL!" And their pet duck died from from the oil spill.
I wonder what it would be like if actors were traded like athletes?  what show should @aus10nichols trade to?
I think lebron wanted to get as close to the oil spill as possible so he can fix it. I think he's planning on running for president of earth
Just left the hardware store. They were selling galvanized nipples and o-rings. What is this world coming to?
I think stephen colbert should take over for steve carell. #theoffice They have the same initials. Dick york/dick sargent. Bewitched!!

#HuffPost  Huff? Post? Sounds like a newspaper to roll your joint with. Or a newspaper for glue sniffers.
It would be the most outrageous #vampire #werewolf foursome the world has ever seen.  And in the end, I would devour them all.  HAHA!!!

@TheRealKDev   YES I DO, DARLIN.
Haha!!  I like messin with yall.  That was a joke.  I think about  a Gabillion people saw it.  Edward makes my heart flutter.
#Eclipse.  ???  Is that the name?
did anyone see the new vampire movie?
That would be like scoring a goal for the wrong team in the World Cup. When I go back to North Carolina, next week, I would be assassinated.
I cant tell. I would get fired. Or sued. Or possibly bumped off. Warner Brothers and CW are like Don Corleone and Tony Soprano combined.
I just read the first script for OTH season 8.  There is a big surprise...  Wanna know?
I don't have a television.  I can't watch futbol or the tour de france.  so so sad
I have worked in Montevideo and Punta del Este.  Me encanta Uruguay.  But my blood is Dutch.  HUP HOLLAND HUP!!!
Also, without an enemy to fight, WE might realize that we dont need them as much as we thought.
If they don't have an enemy, they wont be able to get their legislation through.  The oil is a smoke screen for them to get shit done.
Allowing that pipe to continue leaking does the same thing as leaving osama bin laden alive. They need an enemy to constantly fight
Do they have a pray off?
What happens if methodists and baptists pray together in the religious reflections room at the airport?  Do they try to blow eachother up???

Stop that leak right now if they wanted.
So we can harvest our oil." They will say whatever lies are necessary so they can get their oil.  Be assured, they could
Wouldn't be allowed to drill for that oil. That's why they say they have to dig a "relief well." That's code for, "we are breaking the law
No one is saying this on the news. But the truth is...  Bp could stop that leak anytime they want. But they won't because then they

The government needs big OIL.  They want big OIL.  They are in bed and makin sweet love to BIG OIL.
The politicians are grandstanding.  Acting like they are fixing it all and doling out punishment.  In realidad, they will do nothing.
Tony Hayward hearing.  Prez of BP.  It looks like a guilty guy dodging questions.  But it goes way deeper.
All I see are people trying to advance their career.  They will do nothing.  The taxpayers will be the ones stuck paying for this spill.
It's ridiculous what these politicians are doing.  Acting like honorable policemen.
Mexico vs. France!!!!   AWESOME!!!
GO ARGENTINA!!!  Congrats!!
