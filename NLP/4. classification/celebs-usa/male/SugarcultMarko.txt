@basarath @ChrisShiflett71 @JawbreakerBand Dig in.  The lyrics stand alone as some of the best modern American literature.  The sound is distinctly Jawbreaker w/ an aftertastes of Psychedelic Furs &amp; Hüsker Dü.

Thank you @JawbreakerBand Last night was glorious; loved the set.  You’ve somehow picked up right where you should have left off had the world been ready 20+ years ago.  Aged well &amp; the intervening years have paid off.  I’ll uselessly resist the red wine metaphor.  Vindicated. 🌹
