@brianstelter @whignewtons It's clear why people criticizing this decision would need confidentiality, but why allow anonymity for someone defending the decision? That person is supporting management, and it would make no sense for that person to fear for their job.

@sahilkapur He fails to justify not waiting for an FBI investigation, of course.
@BarefootVoice Let's find out by having one. I'd want to know what an investigation turns up.
.@JeffFlake #EpicFail, but unsurprising. Someone committed to facts and justice would insist on a full investigation first.
@davidaxelrod @ABAesq No.
If I am ever falsely accused of anything, I will personally call for all possible investigative bodies to investigate. That's what you do when you're committed to facts and justice.
@mkraju @jmartNYT @TheOtherKeppler That does not bode well.
@chrislhayes @gsomraCNN And they didn't even have the decency or courage to speak to her. They hid behind a woman they hired for the day and then ditched.
@maggieNYT No
@lesleyabravanel @melinamara @washingtonpost Don't count on her making the history books in states controlled by the current GOP.
.@LindseyGrahamSC when The Shakespearean tragedy of Trump is written, your preposterous grandstanding performance from today, and obvious audition for Attorney General of Trumpistan, will be the end of Act I.
@katiebomhoff @sahilkapur Actually, the FBI can do a great deal and provide the committee and the country with findings.
Attention @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins https://t.co/NnjzhIbXvo
THIS https://t.co/j7peOGBAxx
I expect they'll confirm Kavanaugh. But at least it'll help drive turnout for Dems in the midterms.
@rmayemsinger That question was a performance to appeal to a portion of the GOP base. That's what he's doing.
Wake up, @GOP &amp; @ChuckGrassley: Kavanaugh is weighing in on Dr. Ford's veracity WITHOUT HAVING WATCHED HER TESTIMONY! WTF? This is what a judge does??
Kavanaugh didn't watch Dr. Ford's testimony! WTF
Excellent question comparing him to Gorsuch, @KamalaHarris. #KavanaughHearings
Actually, @KamalaHarris is looking to provide the nation with clarity on this. I'm OK with her going back to the FBI investigation question.
This is from DC bureau chief at The Intercept: https://t.co/zU3HilWcPe
@DaddyFiles IF you learn facts and vote based on good values! Yes!!
Texas: Turn out for @BetoORourke!
Kavanaugh is the one up for SCOTUS, but Dr. Ford is the only one who came across as non-partisan.
Finally. @CoryBooker getting things on the right track. At least trying - Kavanaugh keeps referring to talking point, ignoring whatever the Dems say.
Will Republicans care that the GOP members of this committee refused to address Dr. Ford but are lining up to grandstand and express sympathy for Kavanaugh?
@pbump Yup. They should have focused on his veracity.
Analysis | Mark Judge’s book validates Christine Blasey Ford’s timeline of the alleged Kavanaugh assault https://t.co/Gj2RP1marr
Trump lies constantly. Dems are searching for the truth here. The grandstanding by Republicans in this hearing -- those who didn't even have the guts to ask Dr. Ford questions -- is preposterous.
Pundits: You should all be pointing out repeatedly the Dr. Ford answered every question she was asked, but Kavanaugh keeps performing and avoiding questions. That summarizes a huge part of what's happened today.
@JenniferJJacobs Except that this White House obviously does not value honesty.
@sunny Well said. @abcnews
@chrislhayes @KevinMKruse Yup.
What happened to Mitchell? Now, suddenly, the Republican senators have the guts to actually speak? #EpicFail #sexism #KavanaughFord
Graham trying to blame Dems for the state of things in Washington, and for mistreating people who are up for prominent jobs, is the height of hypocrisy. https://t.co/f9xB0AyFby
OK everyone amid @LindseyGrahamSC's grandstanding, keep in mind that he did not have the guts to ask Dr. Ford a question himself. Shameful.
Kavanaugh is breaking the smug-o-meter by refusing to call for an FBI investigation and refusing to answer crucial questions from Dems.
@maggieNYT @nickconfessore Ask the White House whether they care that he's refusing to actually answer the Dems' questions.
@davidfrum @davequast If only. As you know, Don is now the GOP's dear leader, and he is all about not backing down.
"We got a filibuster but not a single answer" - @SenatorLeahy  Exactly.
Wake up, @ChuckGrassley: Dr. Ford answered the questions. Kavanaugh is refusing to answer the questions. It's. That. Simple. #KavanaughHearings
@KerryPicket @whpresscorps Energized to do what? Ram this nomination through without an investigation?
@KathleenGerson Yup.
@MelindaVInman He did not explain why he has not called for one.
Men and women can be emotional, and we must all accept emotions as natural and healthy. Kavanaugh's tears aren't the problem. His refusal to support an investigation and citing of the Clintons are big problems, for starters.
@maggieNYT https://t.co/xFejvEG9Hh
@Alyssa_Milano Exactly. Good to see you there.
@maggieNYT But the Feinstein exchange is far more important.
@BostonGlobe And he refused to answer.
.@Alyssa_Milano Good to see you right there. #KavanaughHearings
Exactly. @SenFeinstein asking this right now. But so far he's not answering... https://t.co/SOoxsHJiA8
If you want fairness and due process, support an INVESTIGATION, Kavanaugh. #KavanaughHearings
Trump loves anger, but opposes all other emotions as "weakness." There's no way he likes Kavanaugh choking back tears.
Will Kavanaugh fill the seats behind him, and therefore our screens, with women who support him? More of the GOP's effort to use women politically, as they did with Mitchell?
@PreetBharara Like she's trying to rescue her OWN reputation. Hey, she signed up for it.
@lpolgreen Exactly.
@sally_field Millions of men too. Not enough, but still, millions.
The dangerous 'every boy' Kavanaugh defense - https://t.co/s0KKnbamxb
"If anything, the prosecutor has strengthened (Ford's) statements and allegations" - @SenBlumenthal on @abcnews
They keep saying Mitchell is asking questions for individual Republican senators. But there's no indication what questions any individual GOP senator wanted her to be to be asked. So there's no individual accountability. They're all culpable for how this is going.
@Al_Letson @GeeDee215 Ugh. Who?
@GeeDee215 Ugh. Which pundit?
@mrdougfrench @ChrisCoons https://t.co/iZXogBLQQE
Attention @realDonaldTrump @GOP https://t.co/1Y7dHwJnRn
@ezraklein Yup.
The "boys will be boys" argument is bogus, dangerous, misogynistic AND male-bashing. My explanation at @GoodMenProject: https://t.co/bhRgakD7i6 Thanks for bringing it up, @ChrisCoons.
Dr. Ford is providing a powerful reminder of how sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault, can dramatically transform someone's life. #KavanaughHearings
@danpfeiffer Don't look for sense or sensibility in the GOP's desperate flailing.
@SethAMandel @lpolgreen Don't. Trump is the GOP's dear leader, and delusional, and insists on never backing down.
@SteveSchmidtSES Serves them right for supporting efforts to turn the U.S. into The Republic of Trumpistan.
@davidfrum Yup. And the GOP's handling of this is disgusting. On a related note, I finished the #Trumpocracy audiobook. It should be mandatory reading.
@ezraklein @neeratanden And she's there, so those questions didn't make any successful point anyway.
WTF? Mitchell is asking Ford whether she's ever experienced other traumas and about her fear of flying. That's relevant how?? #KavanaughHearings
@JohnJHarwood Don't count on it. Their dear leader Trump is all about never backing down. And in his delusional mind, who knows what this hearing looks and sounds like.
@Alyssa_Milano @GOP YES. https://t.co/SjqQH15gwD
@kylegriffin1 That was powerful. And he is a former U.S. attorney and RI attorney general.
Across this country, there are also male victims of sexual assault. Many must be feeling strength, courage, and hope due to Ford's testimony. All victims, know this: If you speak out, many of us will hear you.
@gabrielsherman @thegarance Exactly. I don't remember everyone I gave a ride to last year, let alone when I got my license in the 80s.
@JesseCharlesLee This. Exactly right.

@peterdaou https://t.co/SjqQH15gwD
Dr. Ford's scientific answer explaining why the detail that Kavanaugh covered her mouth is seared into her memory: priceless. And nice move with @SenFeinstein being the one to ask that.
@rtraister @lpolgreen You mean the woman he brought in for the day so he and the rest of the GOP can hide behind her instead of asking their own questions, even though they've had no problem discussing the case in public?
@christgau_judy @CNN https://t.co/bhRgakD7i6
GOP senators: Ask. Your. Own. Questions. Don't hide behind a woman you bring in for the day to do so. Pathetic.
He's a Republican. Hear that, @GOP? https://t.co/yl2XPv10Mv
Three Kavanaugh supporters reverse course, call for investigation of sexual assault allegations https://t.co/t6j68hIk4s
@lpolgreen Yes. And so important.
@nxthompson No. I don't think he belongs in prison. That would require a criminal complaint, trial, proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I recognize that he previously misled Congress on other issues and cannot be trusted to tell the truth. He doesn't belong on SCOTUS. Many agree w/me.
This. https://t.co/D9Miezfgwx
@Alyssa_Milano @SenFeinstein YES.
@joanwalsh @davequast Exactly.
The inevitable onslaught of misogyny during Dr. Ford's remarks will show how deeply Twitter has been poisoned.
@JRubinBlogger @neeratanden When people study these opening statements in the future, it will be clear how repugnant Grassley's remarks were, and how necessary Feinstein's were.
@ANNELAMOTT At least the alligator's repugnant behavior wouldn't be based on gender.
@CNN Then, he immediately launched into a partisan attack and lied about how he and the GOP have handled this.
@mtomasky @neeratanden Trumpistan.
@robdelaney Yup.
Pathetic. GOP senators who have openly trashed Ford and her story, and defended Kavanaugh, are hiding behind a woman to ask questions for them. If you can speak about her in public, you can ask this witness your own questions.
Grassley is breaking the hypocrisy-o-meter. Pretending to be respectful to her, then switching to a political attack speech. #KavanaughHearings

Also being lost in all this about Kavanaugh: The 'every teenage boy' defense isn't just wrong. It's dangerous, sends a horrific message to teens, and is both misogynistic AND male-bashing. I wrote this up for the @GoodMenProject https://t.co/bhRgakD7i6
"Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, &amp; have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, &amp; in this body who have never met me or spoken w/ me"
