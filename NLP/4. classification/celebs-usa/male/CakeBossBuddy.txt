Isn't it always? Love this competition https://t.co/WO2mLOgcS1
Pro tip: freezing cake actually RETAINS the moisture! #bakersvsfakers
You guys always ask and that just confirmed it: yes, they can hear us (most of the time)! #bakersvsfakers
A mess in the kitchen... ultimate pet peeve #bakersvsfakers
Nothing I love more than a salty and sweet treat. How would you balance the two flavor profiles? #bakersvsfakers
Who guessed right?! #bakersvsfakers
What do you guys think? Who is going to take this round - a baker or a faker? #bakersvsfakers

This a crazy talented and creative group of people. Do you feel confident in your guesses? #BakersVsFakers
Are you in an area with high humidity? The sugar will pull moisture from the air. Leave the meringues in the oven for a few hrs after baking https://t.co/vQ9EQixvjO
Pro tip: weighing out all of your ingredients in baking is so necessary. Take the time, your results will thank you. #BakersVsFakers
Biting off more than you can chew in a competition? That’s a risky game. #BakersVsFakers
Watching how someone cracks an egg in the kitchen is one of the easiest ways to spot a baker or a faker. #BakersVsFakers
Do you think you know who the bakers are and who the fakers are yet? #BakersVsFakers
Who do you think has this round in the (piping) bag? #BakersVsFakers
Pro tip: enhance the chocolate flavor in your recipe with shots of espresso, spoonfuls of a really dark roast, or an espresso powder.
I’m also a big fan of a spicy hot chocolate! Try this limited-run recipe if you are too: https://t.co/BhfY34RlNB #BakersVsFakers

@llexijean Yes! my dog baci is watching with me too
If you want to perfect beautiful presentation Repetition! Do it until you can do it with your eyes closed. #BakersvsFakers
Experimenting in baking isn’t always going to be FRUITFUL. At the end of the day, it’s a science. Every ingredient counts. #BakersvsFakers
I'm over the top when it comes to whipped cream prep. Learn how to make this at home! Game changer. So easy. #BakersvsFakers
Respect those who respect chocolate. #BakersvsFakers
An inspiration. Looks awesome! https://t.co/JnS64sbhAP
@kierstynnnnnn14 Thank you! I love our strawberry shortcake. I have a weakness for fresh whipped cream and really good strawberries
What do you guys think? Who are the bakers and who are the fakers? #BakersvsFakers
I feel attacked every time someone opens the oven door when there’s something in there. What did those cupcakes do to you? #BakersvsFakers
Pro-tip: don’t swap out fats in your baking recipes all the time, sometimes you need it. Be ready for a little trial&amp; error #BakersvsFakers
On a savory note: pepper jelly mixed with mayonnaise and horseradish is an awesome sandwich spread. #BakersvsFakers
Cupcakes are literally a piece of cake. But do you think a spicy cupcake in under 45 minutes is all that easy? #BakersvsFakers
It's time! #bakersvsfakers is starting NOW on @FoodNetwork - who's chatting with me tonight?

Jay's not so clean work area gave me some anxiety, can't lie #cleanfreak #CooksVsCons
A meatball just ain't a meatball without pork, veal and beef - everybody agree ? #CooksVsCons

Did you guess that right?!  #CooksVsCons
How crazy is it there are two cons in this round? These dishes are insane #CooksVsCons
Alright. We're in a heated debate here.. Has anyone completely convinced you they're a cook? #CooksVsCons
Nothing wrong with throwing a little Italian in there in the Valastro household either  #CooksVsCons
I agree with @grahamelliot: it stresses me out! #CooksVsCons
Is Brandon trying too hard to convince us he's a pro right now? What do you think.. Cook or con? #CooksVsCons
