On his old website, Brody Stevens had a pic of him and @davidcrosss with the caption “2 Generations of Laughter” and I don’t know why but that always laid me out. I think Cross is maybe 5 years older than him.

Yeah. It’s a G-rated movie with, perhaps, THE MOST violent murder sequence ever filmed. The way Richard Bennet adds that little harp trill when the blade is removed. UGH. Brilliant but also UGH holy shit. https://t.co/1l5qsr5yrk
That’s also genius directing on Sidney Lumet’s part — assemble a dozen of the world’s greatest actors and don’t allow them to speak onscreen for 1/2 an hour (or for the week it probably took to film that tour-de-force). https://t.co/r2sQndHc0C
I’ve seen that film a dozen times. Notice how often Shirley Temple songs are heard — in the Turkish restaurant, when Poirot is singing to himself, the “cluu-uues” line. The “murder” is motivated by an earlier child’s murder. It’s eerie. https://t.co/XClLc7rmqh

And the GREATEST example of this is @MelBrooks’ YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN — Brooks was OBSESSED with those films and made such a SPECIFIC parody of the Universal Horror “house style” that even out of context everyone got it. Even the actors subtly revert to that 30s style of acting. https://t.co/hJF36o9fqJ
Another good example of this was from last week’s @nbcsnl — @mulaney and Pete Davidson spinning brilliance from talking about THE MULE. I bet 3/4 of the viewers hadn’t seen it and the bit STILL killed. https://t.co/hJF36o9fqJ

Because the cynical will always exploit the idealistic. Karl Rove used to mock evangelicals behind their backs ‘cuz he just wanted their votes. So we have to snuff out cynicism with ACTION. I’m also guilty of cynicism but I’m trying. It’s a hard way but it’s doable. https://t.co/hb1egD5R0f

Could be. I had a visceral reaction to her, and she brilliantly depicted how real violence can hide and then explode out of the seemingly dull and ineffectual. @ashlieatkinson is crazy charming and adorable in real life and man o man did she strip all that away. No ego. https://t.co/MCG8QpMQal
The Best Supporting Actress category for this year’s @TheAcademy Awards is amazing but I REALLY wish @ashlieatkinson had gotten some love for BlacKkKlansman. She was terrifying and pathetic — hands-down the most unsettling villain of 2018. Her monologue in the bedroom...

No they're not. I've never been cooler doing these. That said, I'd also like to say that MC Skat Kat is NOT the future of hip hop, contrary to what I said in my senior yearbook quote. https://t.co/hU3AUKGcBX
Of course it has. But I'm focusing on MY actions, and how I could do better in the future. How I could approach things better. Everyone's looking for a "chit" like this is a zero-sum game, and it's not. There's no "win." Just, hopefully, growth and wisdom. https://t.co/7o0weJzIyQ
No. not at all. I just wish we could do MORE episodes this season. Filming the second season of @NBCAPBio went by so fast -- the scripts were fantastic and the cast is a dream. It doesn't feel like a job. It's a thing I "get" to do and I'm greedy and I wanna do more. https://t.co/UhXRbwyF55

And finally, the all-time champion: Larry Cohen’s IT’S ALIVE. 10-second TV spot that still scares the shit out of me. https://t.co/vVCb50xmVa
INTERVIEW WITH THE ASSASSIN — not even that bad of a film, but it should have been SO MUCH better given the beyond-creepy trailer. Locked-down shot of Raymond J. Barry calmly talking to camera — and scaring the shit out of you. https://t.co/vVCb50xmVa
The trailer for SUMMER OF SAM is better than most movies — and especially the movie it hyped. Amazing use of music (“Fernando” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again”) with dynamic imagery and cutting. Go watch it. https://t.co/vVCb50xmVa

5/ Or? Better yet? Let @LiamGavin choose ANY @cullenbunn or @warrenellis property and give him free, drunken reign.
Do NOT “reward”  @LiamGavin by letting him reboot anything @DC or @Marvel or ANY established “property.” Like @Lexialex, he’s above that. Jam a keg tap into his cerebrum, roll film, get the fuck out of the way, and let some REAL darkness loose. (But let him reboot CONSTANTINE).
3/ And THIS THIS THIS is how John Constantine needs to be portrayed. All due respect to Keaneau and @mattryanreal — but @steve_oram is the ESSENCE of Constantine — pure charm, real sleaze, pathetic heartbreak, ugly addiction and SCARY.
2/ This. Fucking. Movie. Either something insanely supernatural is happening or NOTHING is happening but, based on the behavior of the two protagonists (it’s essentially a two-person film) something INSANE is happening and the authorities need to be alerted.
1/ Dear Twitter: When a movie as amazing as A DARK SONG exists, you need to tell me about it IMMEDIATELY. How am I just now watching it?

No. But that's a good one. "Gray Matter" is a brilliant, beer-and-pretzels retelling of Arthur Machen's "Novel of the White Powder." It's like if Leon Payne decided to write something for Weird Tales. https://t.co/QnITiSjoDY
Also? Of all the film, television and Dollar Baby adaptation of stories in this book. NO ONE has ever touched "Gray Matter." And it'd be a truly disturbing body horror film. Does @panoscosmatos know about this one? https://t.co/GAoOfCXz5N
Yeah, this one. I first read this when I was 11. @StephenKing wrote it in 1970 for an issue of Cavalier. Love thinking of the poor dude encountering this mind fuck of a story in what he thought would be a fun stroke-mag. https://t.co/GAoOfCXz5N
Tonight is the second-to-last episode of this season's @Lodge49 and it is a DOOZY. There's a scene with @GroovyBruce that I can't describe and you probably won't be able to either after you see it. Holy yikes.

6/ Anyway, sorry for the Tweet burst. But @Lodge49 is sublime and I selfishly want it do well so more of @jimatdeltaco's work will get adapted. Just stay put after tomorrow night's @BetterCallSaul and let yourself...drift.
5/ Brent's work in @Lodge49 -- weary, wary, soulful and sad -- will hopefully put him where Bryan Cranston, Ann Dowd and Margo Martindale rightfully find themselves now. HOW has @Honors_Zombie not done a "Murderer's Row" video about him?
4/ But the BEST thing about @Lodge49? It cast Brent Jennings as one of the leads. Brent is an actor who steals movies with a single scene (watch him mop the floor with Schwarzenegger in RED HEAT back in '85).
3/ And the MUSIC on @Lodge49. Linda Osher and Thomas Patterson give Maggie Phillips and Tricia Halloran (from @FargoFX) a run for their money as far as painting a sonic landscape.
2/ @Lodge49 is Pynchon, Lynch and Malick with a sunburn and coffee breath. It's people trying to connect with the cosmic, hobbled by utility bills, repo men and office politics.
1/ Just watched the first 3 eps of @Lodge49. Just amazing. I've been a fan of @jimatdeltaco's writing since reading MIDDLE MEN, and this show is a distillation of his brilliant world view.

I don't 100% agree. I think the SENTIMENT is always there, but this performative, unashamed, entitled&amp;calm public racism is something new. Well, it's something OLD, but it's making an unnerving comeback. https://t.co/ivveUcmzBu
Huh! Weird! Another out-of-nowhere, "suddenly brave" racist. It's like there's someone in power setting the tone for these bedbugs. Making 'em feel like there's someone in their corner. https://t.co/hWSxaVu5s8

7 eps into #LukeCageSeason2. Fantastic. I hope @Theorossi and @AlfreWoodard get some Emmy love in ‘19. A boy toy who genuinely loves his Sugar Mama, and a Sugar Mama who sees him as a liability. A pair of nervy, brilliant performances. Steals the show.
