@chasegravens31 @NitroCircus they are specially built, but I am trying to get someone to make more of them, they are awesome
@KyleRamsey64 straight rhythm was awesome! 500cc 2 stroke, are you kidding #nitrocircuslive
@julia_a__ i didn't, but we coming back to Canada next year, so I want to!
@CassiFinkbeiner @StreetBikeTommy @Special_Greg @chadkagy @Erikroner The front flip is scary, but all the bicycle tricks scare me most
@alexyess596 traveling the World with all your best friends is amazing! #nitrocircuslive
Is everybody ready for #nitrocircuslive on @MTV2 I've got a prize for someone at the end of the episode!

@julia_a__ @StreetBikeTommy @chadkagy @Special_Greg @Erikroner @BilkoFMX Thanks for watching and being a part of it!
@BilkoFMX @kaelagonzalez16 @NitroCircus negative ghost rider! haha. I've done those and I hate them! but it's fun watching bilko!
@iluvracing42 @NitroCircus Not yet! just getting her on the strider!
@Hthomas80 @StreetBikeTommy @chadkagy @BilkoFMX @Special_Greg @Erikroner my parents. It's what we did as a family on the weekends growing up
@JoyLSvoboda @NitroCircus @StreetBikeTommy @BilkoFMX @Erikroner @Special_Greg The guys are good at crashing. surprisingly few injuries..

@julia_a__ no sleep and trying to push yourself night after night when your tired. when one person gets sick on tour, everyone gets sick.

@Bianca_X23 @StreetBikeTommy surprises a lot of people with his trampoline and drift skills.. but i was shocked he didn't roll the car!

From @RedBullLV: What is your favorite #RBEditions flavor? #kobalt400
Did I make it across the line?  Does it count? top ten. WOOOOHOOOO! #kobalt400
From @HenryLorenz: First thing that came to your mind when u slid across the Daytona finish line? #kobalt400
Talk on twitter.. But honestly, we've been going over last years dvd's from this event.  Watching in car and talking about strategy.
Question: How do you kill time during a weather delay on race weekend? #kobalt400
I've always ridden Suzuki and been partial to yellow. That's why my hood is all yellow. Reminds me of motocross #kobalt400
Question from @nascartoons: Of the colors on the no. 60 car, which one is your favorite? #kobalt400
I look up to almost all of the drivers.  It's awesome getting to know them better. Crafton, Bayne and Stenhouse jr are my favorites.
Question: What current or former driver do you look up to? Why? #Kobalt400
I learned that I have to have more patience. I can't learn what i need to if i hurt the car early in the race. #kobalt400
Question from @Therealtjohnson: What did you learn from last week's race in Phoenix that you'll apply this weekend. #kobalt400
Out here in Las Vegas waiting for the rain to stop. I'll be taking questions from the Kobalt Command Center. #Kobalt400
