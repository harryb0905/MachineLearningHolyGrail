Today was so hot I was getting dizzy. Coated entire body in 50spf, still got burnt kuz I had to pour so much water on self it washed away
Unexpected, but really nice to put on a good show for my new @BMCProTeam early in year. Thanx for the bottles all day guys! It was a hot one
Stings to be so close! But it's motivating. He was willing to loose &amp; let the group come back more than I was, good move.
thot about this TONS. 140characters not enuf. Would be willing to interview/publish discussion on it. In short: pros outweigh the cons.
Glad this # talk started something! Bigger # on back &amp; arm 4visibility. Like soccer: only 2 digit. Ok for BMC and Garmin each have rider #21
Easy to implement, more respectable, less waste, easier for fans to follow, better jersey sales? Almost ALL other sports do this, why not us
REALLY hate pinning on #'s. Pro Sport, amateur style. Everyone Ive talked to thinks its a good idea: Jerseys w/ permanent #'s/names on back.
