@Love_MissMilan I agree w you. My point was that when she was asked if it was a racial slur and she said no, she is lying.
@Love_MissMilan it's not a contest to see which racial slur is worst. But it is a racial slur.
@andersoncooper @AC360 she said no. It made it clear to me that she would lie under oath if she thought it would help martin family.
@andersoncooper @AC360 surprised no one has brought up when martins girlfriend was asked if she thought cracker%%xx was a racist remark?
