@LateRoundQB @SigmundBloom Very fair though I will say Guice is a better pass catcher than AP. He never got to show it in college but in practice last year prior to injury plan was to use him a lot more in pass game. But yeah he‚Äôs a fascinating player whose ADP could be all over the place.
@chrizmillr This should be the clip they show at the Oscars.
@LateRoundQB @SigmundBloom Er ATT I mean
@LateRoundQB @SigmundBloom Biggest concern is if they bring back AP which is a possibility. Otherwise I think volume will off set offensive ineptitude. With questions at QB they will go very run heavy again. (Remember AP was 5th in rush art last year).
@Bond_TX Only the two best basketball highlights I have!

@NoExtraPoints Let‚Äôs ask @MikeClayNFL !
I‚Äôm playing @MikeClayNFL in the @ScottFish24 AAF expert league. My Qb is Garrett Gilbert. One of my WR is Charles Johnson. Just gonna leave this right here for, again, @MikeClayNFL https://t.co/P3HZwhfTNm
@MattNel23 @Globies Nice to meet you. Thanks for the love.
@CoachEnglish43 @ScottFish24 would know

Just want to give a shout out to @NoExtraPoints ... I‚Äôm enjoying watching and playing fantasy I. the @TheAAF and the @NoExtraPoints feed does a great job covering the league. No idea who they are - but whoever you folks are - keep up the great work.
@YahooNoise I like that you think it was your opinion on Flacco that caused folks to call you annoying. üòé
@Callenbeballin @TylerGheeNFL Hahaha got our email Callen. Thanks!
@scotteTheKing @Fantrax Congrats on the new gig, Scott. They‚Äôre lucky to have you.

In 1999, I tried to get a freelance fantasy sports job with The Sporting News - no dice. Rotoworld hired me a few months later &amp; launched me in a way that would never have happened at TSN. https://t.co/Un854Kps9D
@FieldYates @Globies https://t.co/dwpc84j9My
As a kid, I absolutely loved the @Globies ... and as a Dad I‚Äôve enjoyed sharing them with my kids. So when they invited me  to play with them this Saturday afternoon in Hartford, I said yes immediately. Looking forward to it! If you come to the game I‚Äôll be the slow short one. https://t.co/PmRiJZFVX2
In Flacco‚Äôs 25 starts over the past two seasons, the Ravens ranked 27th in red zone pass percentage  and 30th in yards per play (4.83, only the Cardinals and Bills rank worse). Same time frame Flacco has completed 35.8% of his deep passes (ranking him 34th of 38 qualifiers).

@V1shal15 Tell me this story beyond what's on the GoFundMe page....
@MikeClayNFL Yeah my thought was assuming they don't get a WR back for AB they would want to re-sign Eli. But that's why I listed Washington first.
Agree with this take. Also, expect James Washington &amp; Eli Rogers to be on a lot of sleeper lists come August. https://t.co/LPFnKAkzFd

@RedskinsCult Yeah will likely have to do that. Thanks
@andrewtabs @PJHughes45 thanks
@PJHughes45 Annoying. But for me it's just people I don't like in fantasy sports. Must be awful for those in politics, news, more serious topics.
@CPatrickNFL @RotoViz @RotoVizDynasty Congrats Curtis! Terrific news for fans of @RotoViz (and I count myself among them)
A tweet from someone I specifically DON'T follow just showed up in my timeline. Like, I have made a concious choice not to follow this person but then their most recent tweet just showed up in my TL. NOT RT by someone I follow or anything either. This happen to anyone else?
As always, Mike doing work. Wouldn't be surprised if Hunt is actually suspended for the whole year, either. Still think Chubb will be a very productive fantasy RB for all of next season. https://t.co/y5th0qpzNa

@Anders157 @ScottFish24 Right or dead wrong I‚Äôm impressed with the effort. Helps you like my team. Although if you are right I need a new TE.
@ZachHicks2 Just how they were drafted. I‚Äôll adjust lineup before kickoff obv. Crowded backfield but always liked him at A&amp;M.

@DanielDopp You're holding up the draft, yo
@MikeClayNFL hahaha. Definitely. This is the most YOLO draft I've ever done.
@MikeClayNFL I like the Woodrum pick. Was between him and Gilbert for us.

@DanielDopp @MikeClayNFL @Jeff_Mans @LetoSal @TheAAF @ScottFish24 @RyanMc23 @LateRoundQB Motto of our TV show
@Jeff_Mans @MikeClayNFL @LetoSal @TheAAF @ScottFish24 @RyanMc23 @DanielDopp @LateRoundQB ME: Wow, this draft is taking much longer than I thought.  My wife, waiting for me to finish so we can run an errand: No S#*&amp;!
With all the starting RB's gone, went Seantavius Jones/WR of the Atlanta Legends at 2.08 and then Charles Johnson/WR of the Orlando Appollos at 3.01. 8 tm lg, 1 QB/RB/WR/TE, 2 Flex, 4  BN. Feel like how I felt drafting in the 1980's....
@LateRoundQB I liked the Bell pick fwiw
@LetoSal @DLF_Kenm @TheAAF @ScottFish24 @MikeClayNFL @RyanMc23 @Jeff_Mans @DanielDopp @LateRoundQB Isn't he hurt?
@nirobi03 @TheAAF @ScottFish24 @MikeClayNFL @RyanMc23 @Jeff_Mans @DanielDopp @LetoSal @LateRoundQB Scott Fish set it up. QB/RB/WR/TE, 2 Flex, 4 bench, PPR. 8 teams
@SWBenson83 @TheAAF @ScottFish24 @MikeClayNFL @RyanMc23 @Jeff_Mans @DanielDopp @LetoSal @LateRoundQB @AafLegends Hahahaha hope you're right. Just snagged Seantavius Jones baby!
@RyanMc23 I thought about him but worried he wouldn't catch that many passes &amp; they have a few other guys there so held my nose and went with volume on T Rich.
Doing a @TheAAF fantasy draft with @ScottFish24 @MikeClayNFL @RyanMc23 @Jeff_Mans @DanielDopp @LetoSal @LateRoundQB ..... Just picked Trent Richardson of the Birmingham Iron with my first pick.... This draft is totally #YOLO

By the way, how can anyone ever argue against Brady as the greatest of all time?
Hate hate hate that a game like that ends without KC getting a chance to touch the ball. OT - at least in the playoffs - should be college rules.
Or no rooting
As someone who would like this game to go as long as possible I don‚Äôt like the fact that Brady gets the ball first.
A great question and none come to mind. https://t.co/dsZEmYpQrl
I have nonrootig interest in this game and I‚Äôm still on the edge of my seat. Insane.
It should be harder than that. Even for the GOAT
Well.... it ain‚Äôt boring. This game man. This game. Wow.
But how many of them did he actually see? https://t.co/G4hIsCrgIi
49 having himself a game.
Wow. Amazed.
Don‚Äôt know how you can overturn it.
If the Chiefs win this game, that stop was why.
What a stop.
Patriots are 6-0 when Michel runs for a TD and have won 18 straight when Brady is not sacked. Both boxes checked after the first quarter. Can Chiefs break the streak?
Wow. Helluva game. Hate to see a bad call be such a prominent part of the game but still. Two huge clutch kicks and Rams are going to the SB! Congrats to Les Snead, Coach McVay &amp; the entire Rams organization.
Being an official is a very tough job, no doubt, but way too many games (and as a result, jobs) are decided by poor calls. There has to be a better way. https://t.co/s9HyCorYE1

Obviously Peterson and Lynch influenced that heavily but still... hard to excited about DET pass game with this move?
Bevell also very run heavy w/ MIN 2006-2010....
Was SEA OC from 2011-2017: During that time, SEA was: 30th in pass %, 25th in RED ZONE pass %, 3rd in rush %, 8th in RED ZONE rush % &amp; had 2nd most rushing yds &amp; 3rd most rushing att in the NFL in that span. This is good for Kerryon, not so much for Stafford/Golladay etc https://t.co/2RFxTVz4qp

@MichaelDavSmith @DavidPurdum We explicitly say "Our friends in Vegas" or we will reference the odds at a specific book.
@MichaelDavSmith @DavidPurdum We do a decent amount of that on Fantasy Football Now &amp; especially on the podcast as it relates to fantasy. "With this game being one of the highest over/unders on the board and XX team being seven point dogs, so and so is one of my favorite streamer QB's this wk" kind of thing.
@DavidPurdum I believe it. I wasn't sure if you meant subtle like Brent / Al subtle "This is a FG that is interesting to some..." or you meant "The line was 2 1/2 so this FG matters..." where you openly discuss but not mentioning it every single sentence. That make sense?
@Sobey1Kenobi @TheEllenShow @tomdelonge @tomhanks @JKCorden @tonyromo @BarackObama @Ninja @ConstanceWu @SteveCarell Appreciate you. Where do you live?
@jasonrmcintyre @DavidPurdum @darrenrovell Many people watch football that either a) don't have twitter b) don't engage on twitter during a game. c) Aren't even online during a game
@BFawkesESPN @DavidPurdum ha. My audience is ALSO not objective
@Sobey1Kenobi @TheEllenShow @tomdelonge @tomhanks @JKCorden @tonyromo @BarackObama @Ninja @ConstanceWu @SteveCarell One of these things is not like the other one. One of these things doesn't belong.

How‚Äôs this for a weird stat? In Todd Gurley‚Äôs career, the Rams are 12-2 when he scores in the 2nd quarter.
Interesting stat from @KyleSoppeESPN .... Chiefs had 297 first half points this regular season. That was more than 5 teams scored during the ENTIRE regular season (OAK, WSH, BUF, JAX and AZ).
Colts are 10-1 over their past 11. Over that stretch, they‚Äôve allowed a league low 15.6 PPG. Chiefs already. have 17. With over 10 minutes left. In the first half. https://t.co/75gDL5ZOFE
Since Tyreek Hill entered the NFL in 2016, he is 1 of 18 players with at least 20 TD receptions. Those 18 players have combined for a total of 11 rush/return TDs (playoffs included).   Hill has 10 of them.  @cheetah

@HeathLuman CAN‚ÄôT. WAIT.
@AJMass Probably
@billbarnwell Mum‚Äôs the word
@realMacNeil Flipping back and forth.
‚ÄúHey Mr. President. We know you‚Äôve kept a pretty low profile since being out of office but would you like to dress as a pineapple and sing on a dumb reality show?‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me talk to Michelle but that sounds like a great idea for my legacy‚Äù - how judges imagined the pitch went.
Kids are asleep. Wife is out. So I‚Äôm alone at home and decided to try the Masked Singer. A guy in a pineapple just sang I will survive and the judges guessed - not as a joke - that it was Barack Obama. And I‚Äôm still watching. Life in the off-season comes at you fast.
Maybe NYJ sign LeVeon but if they don‚Äôt worth noting in Gase‚Äôs last 6 seasons, (16-18 Miami HC, 15 Chi OC, 13-14 Den OC) he‚Äôs had multiple RBs get 100+ carries in 5 of them. And multiple RBs with 120 or more carries in 4 of the 6. Some of that due to injury &amp; personnel but still.
Gase‚Äôs Dolphins (2016-2018): - slowest operating offense - 25th in red zone efficiency (joins a Jets team that ranked 30th in 2018) - 24th in total rushing yards
THAT is cool... https://t.co/YWofC1G5A2
Kubiak, who is rumored to have once babysat Sean McVay, was last involved in an O in 2016. That yr, DEN was top 10 in RZ rush %. (17th last yr.) Not all RZ carries are created equal of course &amp; Lindsay WILL be involved but Royce did score on 29.4% of RZ carries (4th highest rate) https://t.co/YXNgUmAjr0
Since Kitchens took over in Week 9: Nick Chubb was RB6 (total points); averaged 17.7 PPG (would have been RB8 this season) and had 19.75 touches/game (6th). Under Kitchens, both Duke Johnson &amp; David Njoku saw their red zone usage more than double.
Since Kitchens took over in Week 9:  Baker Mayfield was: QB10 (19 PPG); had a 8.57 YPA (2nd); a 69% completion percentage (10th); avg 4.75 deep completions per game (led NFL); had 9.13 deep attempts per game (2nd); had a 52.1% completion percentage on deep passes (5th)
CLE offense under Freddie Kitchens (all stats since week 9) + Led the NFL in yards per play (6.86) + Tied for the league lead in yards per pass attempt (8.72) + 4th in yards per game (395.1) + 4th in passing yards per game (285.9) 23.75 points per game (14th) https://t.co/PQHVvds75L
If you are in college &amp; interested in PR... ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/OwoGmaF44Q
If it helps teams get over the hump, remember, Jeff and Sean McVay coached many of the same players! They have that in common! https://t.co/nPkOCitsvP
Agree with this take. Also just a general thought every time I see @danorlovsky7 he just crushes it. Really glad he‚Äôs with ESPN. He makes us better. https://t.co/JLvk7geJ4b
In his 9 starts last season, Winston avg 4.6 deep completions &amp; 11.1 deep attempts per gm. Both would have led the NFL if he qualified. For reference, Mahomes led NFL with 4.2 deep completions per game and Mayfield led with 8.8 deep attempts per game. Winston is a good fit for BA
@TheJosephBarnes It‚Äôs a shot at front offices being McVay obsessed. I have tremendous respect for Mary Kay.
I‚Äôve heard that among other qualifications, Freddie is Facebook friends with Sean McVay and once invited him to play Candy Crush. https://t.co/ADpKm36xIr
TB had 3 players rank in top 10 in yards per catch in 2018: DJax: 18.9 (1st); Evans: 17.7 (3rd); Howard: 16.6 (9th). DJax &amp; Evans both Top 5 among WRs in air yards per target in 2018. Howard ranked 2nd among TEs last yr. Jameis loves throwing deep-BA a good fantasy fit in TB. 2/2
BA was HC w/AZ (2013-2017) 2nd in air yards per pass attempt. NFL high 25.6% of passes thrown traveled 15+ yards in the air (deep passes). 7th in % of yds that came via pass incl NFL high 71% of red zone yards. 1/2 https://t.co/a2FMkhKPDL
@ScottBarrettDFB So what you‚Äôre saying is he‚Äôs due?
With usual caveats about competition, etc...KK was HC at Texas Tech 2013-2018. Over that stretch, TT ranked:  2nd in pass yds (379.9 per gm) 2nd in pass TDs per gm (2.99) 2nd in % of yds that came via pass (73%) 113th in air yds per pass att (out of 123 schools). #Fantasyfriendly https://t.co/Exeqru5Vmr
@minakimes I still may get a HC job. just depends. All the teams told me they had offered the job to their first choice and were waiting to hear back, but if they don‚Äôt get him.... https://t.co/dCxjF9pcEp
@minakimes I once had a beer with him at the combine three years ago. Related, I‚Äôm at a presser tomorrow where I‚Äôll be announced as the new OC for the Titans.

@BurgundyBlog That's my fear is that the defense will be just decent enough to get them to 6-10 or something and then we back where we always are... lower middle of the pack.
@Fantasy_Guru Congratulations on everything you accomplished with the site, John and best of luck moving forward with everything else you have going on.
@BenCAlamar @StubHub Congrats!!
@BurgundyBlog I'm warming up to the idea of keeping everyone next year, make no major moves in free agency and #tankingfortua.
Anytime sports media lists are generated like this, fantasy sports almost never gets mentioned, despite it's massive audience of young engaged fans and significant revenue generation. Appreciate fantasy sports getting some love here. https://t.co/ZYCovr3laO
Feel bad for Parkey. And not for nothing but the defense had a 5 point lead, at home, late in the 4th quarter. Probably shouldn‚Äôt have come down to a kick. https://t.co/oYHXe8qwl1
@mfuery38 No
@FieldYates Yep! By the way, this is a movie you can see without me or your mom.
Friends of mine just won a massive award for something they spent years working on. I‚Äôm thrilled for them. So... um... no. https://t.co/eZGnn3gw8b
Nice!!!!! Friends of the pod @philiplord &amp; @chrizmillr just won a #GoldenGlobe for Spider-Man: Into the SpiderVerse!! Awesome!!! #06010
I get it, but I hate the ‚Äúicing the kicker‚Äù time-out just before the snap. After they get rid of the fumble out of the end zone is a touchback for other team, they should make that illegal.
@michaelromeo @ESPNFantasy @Eagles Can you send this video to MBFantasyLife @ Gmail? We‚Äôd like to use it on TV. @bryan_rubin

I may have still landed on it by I literally spent 3 minutes on it. Should have given more thought
@MaddJournalist On it.
@bftgpod @ScottFish24 @DBro_FFB @MattHarmon_BYB @JustinLonero @RyanMc23 @LetoSal @liveocgirl @BrandonHerFFB @thekaceykasem @F3Pod @FantasyADHD @TheFantasyMM @EverydayFFB That I should more than 3 minutes coming up with a nickname because ‚ÄúTalented Mr. Roto‚Äù would wind up sticking with me for decades.
@minakimes @bykevinclark "And then I turn the etch a sketch this way..."
@MaddJournalist Did you send it into MBFantasyLife at gmail? I was pretty sure I answered everyone.
@BeverlyHillsC0P Ha. Fair. That was one of my worst calls this year.
I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt you but someone in your league finished last. And whoever that person is deserves this: https://t.co/444M9kP6M5 https://t.co/qOJSODjFey
Just wanted to say I think @Realrclark25 is one of the best analysts we have at ESPN, any sport. That's all.
@philiplord @chrizmillr @ZacEfron Obviously
@coryell_charlie @philiplord @chrizmillr @ZacEfron Trust me as someone who engaged in intense trade negotiations with them.... they ran this team from start to finish, with Chris leading the way. Only celebs who actually play are allowed in the league. No assistants, publicists or friends allowed.
Huge congrats to @philiplord &amp; @chrizmillr. Not only is their Spider-Man: Into the SpiderVerse a huge hit, but more importantly to them I am sure, they won the ESPN Fantasy Focus Celeb Fantasy Football league, defeating @ZacEfron in a tough final. Congrats on a great season!

@john_keim Thank you John for another great year of strong coverage. As always I enjoy your work.
Who would have thought, when this photo was taken this summer, these two would combine to throw for 50 TD passes this season? What a year. Congrats ‚Å¶@PatrickMahomes5‚Å© https://t.co/K9ybnnEP3e
Fantasy heartbreak back to back as Kelce gets a shovel pass that may or may not have been a TD - called down at 1 &amp; Reid doesn‚Äôt challenge. Then Hamilton drops a TD pass against Chargers. Brutal sequence if you have those two players. I do. #bitterberry
And Perriman catches a TD... against the Ravens. How bitter are Baltimore fans right now?
More Josh Allen ... in just over 3 months, he has 5 games with at least 9 carries AND a rush TD. Since 2001, here is the list of QBs that have done that in a season: Cam Newton (2012).... and Allen. Cam has done it once. Vick 0 times. I mean...
@thasch Good question.  @ChampionCauses
Blake Jarwin now has the same number of touchdowns on the year as Rob Gronkowski: 3
Brady came into this game having averaged 11.8 PPG in Week 17 games over the past 5 seasons. 26 points today.
Josh Allen.... have yourself a day. As I was typing this he just threw ANOTHER td...  https://t.co/s4yqnZWHt4
Josh Allen joins Russell Wilson as the only QB since 2001 to have 3 games in a season with 95+ rushing yards AND a rushing TD. In fact, McNabb is the only other QB over that stretch with multiple such games in a season.
Cody Latimer with a SECOND one handed catch today. Unreal.
Josh Allen now up 97 yards rushing and 2 TDS. Only Saquon has more rushing yards among Week 17 players currently.
Blake Jarwin currently with the 7th best game by a TE this season. Plenty of time left. Another 9.5 points would give him the best TE game of the season.
Antonio Brown is OUT
Williams now a great play, obviously. https://t.co/yAdF7HcdW9
Blake Jarwin now with a three TD game because of course he does. #fantasyfootball
Tricky Falcons. Mo Sanu TD pass to Matt Ryan. You read that correctly. Matt Ryan and Ryan Tannehill have TD CATCHES today. Matt Prater has a TD pass. It‚Äôs Week 17.
Still some risk there obviously but great matchup. https://t.co/bCSuHzO1Qt
Who needs two hands?  https://t.co/wZZS8BcCNB
Tricky Dolphins.... Ryan Tannehill CATCHES a TD pass. Dolphins pull within one score at Buffalo
Dak Prescott with his first multi TD pass road game of the season. Apparently all they had to do was unleash Blake Jarwin.
@JonMVoss Yes he does.
Brady is now less than a point from matching his point total over the past two weeks COMBINED. Still 11 minutes left ... in the first half.
Uh oh https://t.co/5RJ6r9CnIA
Tom Brady had 3 more TD passes to RBs than anyone else since 2014 entering today. Two more already. Michel is great, but NE‚Äôs pass catching back will always have value as long as Brady is there.
Players over the past 15 seasons with 5 rush TD and 7 receiving TD in the same season: Jamaal Charles (2013), Kareem Hunt (2018) and now James White
More Allen: Josh now with his 4th game with a rush TD and a pass TD. Only Dak Prescott (5) has at least that many this season https://t.co/3T3gUwTe2X
Josh Allen assumes the QB lead with his 7th rushing score of the season.
Fantasy heartbreak as Janoris Jenkins / Giants D misses an easy pick 6.... (I have Giants D in  DFS). Argh.

@FieldYates Well done. The best tweets are the ones pulled from real life.
Now THAT is #FantasyLife ... https://t.co/rFlrZYytOR
As expected, Spencer Ware, Sammy Watkins and Rashad Penny all OUT tonight.
Has been nothing short of spectacular since coming over from Buffalo. https://t.co/Mi1R5JeQhI
CJ Anderson up to 166 and a TD on 20 carries.  Was sitting on his couch a week ago today.  Unreal. If you had the guts to start him .... https://t.co/slR1hYpQY8
Tweets you didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd see a week ago. https://t.co/EsSdorrFHL
Steelers tried to let Ridley vulture it twice... 0-2... Samuels back in and he scores a rec TD from Ben.
And less than a week after he joined the Rams, CJ Anderson gets into the end zone and now has 84 yards and a TD with a little over 2 to go in the first half. Props to those with the guts to start him.
If this is the last home game for Fitz, nice way to go out....  https://t.co/uLKIUmuNQU
In what might be the final home game of his career, Larry Fitzgerald THROWS a TD to David Johnson....
Wow. What an awful PI call in the PIT-NO game. Haden didn‚Äôt touch him. Result is a gimme TD for Ingram. Just brutal. They need to make PI reviewable.
Suspect you‚Äôll see a lot of this today for LA https://t.co/ZMXynb1xrH
Aaron Rodgers with the first 400 pass yard, 2 rush TD game since 2011 ... when he did it against the Broncos in Week 4.
First carry of the Rams game goes to CJ Anderson.
@BenHeller21 Brutal. I feel for you
And after a disappointing fantasy season Kyle Rudolph gets in for his second score today because fantasy football.
ATTN those that play on @ESPNFantasy ... Todd Gurley has now been removed from the UNDROPPABLE list. If you‚Äôre in a re-draft league that ends its season today, feel free to drop him to grab a replacement.
I would go Damien Williams https://t.co/cR1plFqD34
Ultimately the Rams run game is obviously an unknown and despite the great matchup I hate this much uncertainty, especially in a Wk 16 game. If you have a reasonable other option that‚Äôs the direction I go. None of this ideal of course. It‚Äôs a game of odds - how lucky do you feel? https://t.co/uRDEyDw951
BTW that Hail Mary was an 11.4-point catch for Rudolph. That catch alone would have been his 4th best game of the season. 6‚Äô6‚Äù.... you can‚Äôt teach that.
Respect https://t.co/yPQJqUd9wL
Two big losses https://t.co/p2d8u2adrB
It‚Äôs official. Gurley is OUT. Justin Davis is active - again expect CJA to lead the RB‚Äôs but I‚Äôd expect all to be involved. Also - my concern over Goff‚Äôs volume is no longer there. I expect him to throw more in this one. https://t.co/ir7cDBRpff
I tweeted this yesterday. If picking between Rams RB I prefer CJA over Kelly. But if you have a more solid option (Cohen/Howard/Carson/Ingram/D Williams/) I‚Äôd go that way. Expect CJA to get 12-14 touches. Think Breida vs CJA is a toss-up. https://t.co/Qz4JxThFIb
Wow. Hail Mary works for Cousins.... big Kyle Rudolph comes down with it.
WHOA. https://t.co/xTsINgg6FN
And Marlon Mack is vultured by Nyheim Hines at the GL. #bitterberry
Eli McGuire on pace for a 3rd straight game with 17 carries/3 catches/rush TD. Would tie for the longest such streak since Arian Foster had 4 straight in 2011.
Hey @DanielDopp ... Julio ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù Jones now sits alone atop the receiving TD leaders since Week 9.
As you may have read in this week's column., here's this year's @ChampionCauses list.... If a player helps you win some  in fantasy this year, consider donating a portion to a charity supported by that player. Last yr FF raised ovr 50k for Shriners Children Hosp.

@boxcar_michael @bryan_rubin
Just checked. Turns out I‚Äôm playing against TEN D/ST in every single one of my finals except one. So.... how‚Äôs your night going? https://t.co/AGmwzHDsSi
Agree with this. He hired DC so ultimately that falls on him but that loss is on the defense. And in many cases it was just poor tackling, poor plays, penalties on the defense.... what a gut punch loss. But overall....2 straight years for Gruden to win 7 gms w/ 20+ players on IR. https://t.co/JU8fgsXdqZ
The ending was not only brutal for Skins fans &amp; fantasy players facing TEN D/ST but for those with other interests as well.... https://t.co/y8TvHZoD3V
@JennaLaineESPN If any of Jenna‚Äôs friends are reading this, please someone talk her into going out.
@john_keim Floyd‚Äôs drop at 5 &amp; Ha Ha whiff on INT both back breakers.
Also, I can‚Äôt believe ppl who started TEN D/ST getting bailed out like that. Wow.
Well, that stinks. Gutty game by the offense.  Peterson is unreal and overall Johnson played well.  Line was gutty too. That late pick was tough but that loss is on the defense. Brutal loss. I‚Äôm so bummed.
@JennaLaineESPN Try Die Hard.
Keenan Allen &amp; Melvin Gordon are active.
@jwyattsports @KingHenry_2 And the refs tbh. That PI should have been a no call.
https://t.co/7JQrYcS370
That is so tricky tack. Are you kidding me?
@AaronNagler @swiftsren Congrats!!
Come on defense. You got the lead in the 4th and you‚Äôre facing Gabbert. This is on you. Let‚Äôs go.
Certainly a risk but if Allen is active I‚Äôm starting him. https://t.co/0cCkDnZZyc
Had an interesting convo earlier today with @LindseyThiry RE: Gurley. Concern on Kelly is pass pro. Struggled bad last wk-hence the CJA talk. CJA conditioning may not be 100% at this point so MY interpretation after talking with Lindsey is around a 65 CJ/35 JK split IF Todd sits.
CC @TeamJuJu https://t.co/Pzn79wRBj5
@JPFinlayNBCS I feel like Jay is doing some of his best coaching right now. Win or lose - just competing with this group is impressive. That TD drive was a thing of beauty.
4th string Josh Johnson &gt; 2nd string Blaine Gabbert.
üëÄ https://t.co/fM53GJDhp3
@DhaSickest Truth
Keep letting them off the hook on third down.
@FieldYates Not his proper name
@billbarnwell Don‚Äôt hate Bill.
@john_keim Truly unreal.
Man was that drive impressive. Damn.
.@TeamJuJu gets it. üôå https://t.co/iyHpMBx7rf
@billbarnwell Gotta get the @FantasyLifeApp ... you‚Äôll get it faster.
A possibility. But not a probability. Remember CJA just got there. Davis is banged up so Kelly should def have some kind of a role. Can‚Äôt imagine CJA gets Gurley‚Äôs workload even if he starts. https://t.co/H6id8kcYab
Obviously a massive story. If you‚Äôre playing for a title this week chances are you have Gurley. I‚Äôm not sure I buy the CJ Anderson talk but there are rumors he will be heavily involved along with Kelly/Davis if he misses the game. More to come but start preparing. https://t.co/AeuURTXiJu
Will be the Melvin show on Sunday with some Justin Jackson sprinkled in.... https://t.co/9WuzFG2Qz4
ICYMI: Week 16 #LOVEHATE is up; includes a way too early Top 50 for 2019 and a spotlight on @ChampionCauses https://t.co/rxVKm8DPeJ
@ThirdPrice not bad
fyi... JuJu sounding like on the positive side of a GTD https://t.co/f7gRAKYdTa
@ChaseBrunner Until he got hurt he was.
Gonna be a Ballage Barrage. Gonna stay at the Ballage Mahal. I‚Äôm pulling nothing but 21‚Äôs at the Ballage-io. For us early Kalen Ballage truthers, the time is now. https://t.co/gLTIpm6FiD

Hey @BillSimmons .... we might need to do an emergency pod about this. https://t.co/QFMOxe2u4R
@PaulWoodin1 Yes of course
I‚Äôm always asked ... how did we EVER come up with the name for the researcher on The Fantasy Show on ESPN+ ‚ÄúThe Statapillar‚Äù? A hard hitting documentary tells the tale. https://t.co/XKgo0XlcDG
@spanglerrod Exactly. It‚Äôs just more about where you are comfortable taking a TE vs anything specifically on Kelce.
@bnobach13 @bnobach18 Weird. Didn‚Äôt realize it was sold out. Apologies. There are these socks on Amazon https://t.co/LbL4RCoy2j
This year, vs MIN, Davante Adams had 8/64/TD &amp; 5/69/TD. VS Chicago he had 5/88/TD &amp; 8/119 (last week!). VS Det he had 9/140/TD &amp; plays them week 17. But ok. Just keep calling me names as your argument against Davante Adams. https://t.co/J0t46NgmxP
@ZTS_65 @scott_pianowski It‚Äôs out
@bnobach13 @bnobach18 Yes. Goto https://t.co/Yc1lsWPZwm
@jkTAP26 Goto https://t.co/Yc1lsWPZwm then
@lpeterman He‚Äôs not gonna play. No reason to put a player who is not going to play on hate list
@Chris_Liss @Baloolou @scott_pianowski Since that‚Äôs 100% my job, you are correct Chris. #1 WR for fantasy.
It‚Äôs #LOVEHATE day! Week 16 is now posted, with a way too early Top 50 for 2019 and some info about @ChampionCauses https://t.co/yJn5NaNP2C
@scott_pianowski I am releasing my way too early 2019 Top 50 today. I have Adams as WR1.
Can one of the Mega-cast broadcasts just be me, @DanielDopp and a bunch of angry puppets? https://t.co/ulhwFIb5sI
Here‚Äôs a pic of some of the items available at the store... love the tumblers. https://t.co/5saB4jRV24

Heads up if you have or faced Zeke.... https://t.co/DV4qxAvXYp
In fantasy football news, since that‚Äôs the job, this ups the target share for Hogan &amp; Patterson but I can‚Äôt imagine starting either of them in Week 16 given the unknowns. Edelman is the only NE WR I would feel comfortable starting this week in season long. Hurts Brady as well obv
This https://t.co/4Hoi6kHpzO
@Goods209 @FieldYates @ESPNFantasy @DanielDopp Higher seed in regular season.
@Poolmaster13 Sorry. I would make them one or two more spots than the standard setting. so 8 or 9 bench spots.  Vampire has the same roster settings.
@Poolmaster13 Same as other rosters in the league
@DanielDopp @theholdsteady @julienrbaker Should have stuck with the hamstring joke
@MikeClayNFL Does your league count actual NFL point differential in it's scoring? https://t.co/65cE1Ds4N8
Please watch music lover @DanielDopp's desperate attempt to get @theholdsteady &amp; @julienrbaker to notice him by having us do this segment. https://t.co/IdmvJxrd58
@stu33 @GrahamBarfield if it makes you feel better, I'm pro family and Lakers. Two out of three!
@GrahamBarfield Be honest. This is just a humble brag that you're a) engaged b) she plays fantasy c) she made the finals.
CC @MikeClayNFL https://t.co/6HtZ7j0tV5
@EricStangel Hey congrats!! That's awesome!
@hivehusband @minakimes @diannaESPN Don't disagree. I just used the Skins call as an example of how one random bad call can effect the outcome and perception of a team and/or a coach.
Tress Way got jobbed. Absolutely should be a starter in the Pro Bowl, not an alternate. Has had an AMAZING year https://t.co/Peps8qVD6k
If you follow anyone in the fantasy industry, you have no doubt seen a lot of tributes to our freind and colleague @lawrmichaels .. my friend Joe Sheehan, not surprisingly, wrote a wonderful piece on him. I encourage you to take a few moments and read: https://t.co/fEJBxI1OQb
@AndyHerren Angry Andy is my favorite Andy.
I committed podultery with @minakimes ... much fun. Link below. https://t.co/8HRSQbXxYb
I am so very very sad to learn of the passing of my friend @lawrmichaels...The biggest heart you'll ever meet, great fantasy baseball analyst, better person. Marched to his own drumbeat and always had a welcoming smile. The fantasy industry (and ther world) has lost a legend. RIP https://t.co/VbDbneBX3q
Yes, obviously.  I mean, CMC has more TD passes than Cam does in the last 2 games. In all seriousness, CMC will be even more of a focal point for the offense. I can't imagine benching him. https://t.co/Qzh02WPcnF
Hey 06010 podcast fans: Ever wanted to tell us what your opinion on the show but needed questions to do it? Or just love taking surveys? If you listen to the show can you take 90 seconds to fill out a Swurvey to help make the show better? Thanks  https://t.co/Lvo1iMILRO
Awesome. https://t.co/fG9ek1MuIe
@VinylVoyager Yes
@DPernitsky Well, except if he was your starter.... didn't have him in Week 13, brutal in Week 14, good in Week 15 (relatively speaking)
Not surprising but still sad. Aaron Jones, finally freed! Look forward to next year, Aaron. Meanwhile, Jamaal Williams is the number one no brainer waiver add this week. Seven times a RB has rushed 15+ times va NYJ: They averaged 17.7 FPPG https://t.co/SxXzUQlg8t
It's been unreal the drop-off from regular season to crunch time.... https://t.co/bVYingE0K3

This is amazing, surprising and very very cool. Lots of amazing work on this list.  https://t.co/cp3IjTyalU https://t.co/La6FXiA9N3

Drew Brees now has 3 straight games w/ at 28 pass attempts and no more than 1 touchdown pass or 205 passing yards. This is the longest such streak in the NFL since 2008, when Ryan Fitzpatrick had 4 straight such games.
Factually correct, @JasonWitten. McCaffrey &amp; Kamara were great, but: Cam Newton now has consecutive games w/out a TD (rush OR pass) for the first time in his career. Drew Brees finishes Week 15 as QB26 with less fantasy points than, among others, Arizona backup QB Mike Glennon. https://t.co/7XLIhJsfix
It was a crazy Week 15 to say the least. We are breaking down MNF and the waiver wire before discussing some of the most disappointing performances of the week that was. LIVE NOW https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
Dumbest rule in sports. That said - you have Drew Brees &amp; Alvin Kamara and you try a sweep there? https://t.co/OoeWTCpVH5
Related: my auto correct is awful.
Don‚Äôt like me handing off? Upset I don‚Äôt have a TD pass? Can‚Äôt believe you started me for a third brutal week in a row? Wait till I throw a pick on a 2 point conversion.
@FieldYates I meant to give that to Daniel.
Did the same thing to @FieldYates to get to the lady donut this morning https://t.co/9YKE2WWe3t
Number one. Number 1 QB in fantasy. I hate that there is no edit on Twitter.
What if I told you, from Week12-15, you were the number QB in all of fantasy football? https://t.co/nrxAgXbvLA
Last 2 weeks, Drew Brees is QB26 in fantasy.  Has a total of two points in the first half. https://t.co/20iIfBNssH
This. So this. https://t.co/aDKFpE86ed
There‚Äôs not enough time on Twitter to show you the end of this segment from The Fantasy Show on ESPN+ but it was all I could do to keep a straight face. Hopefully you see the show and see how this ended. Much fun. https://t.co/ypWJKDSDRz

@FieldYates "My name is Field Yates. People call me Field Yates."
We need a name for what happened this weekend. Fant-pocalypse? The Weekend With No Points? The Sunday Where Fantasy Went to Die? Whatcha got?
That is true fantasy heartbreak for those with Goff and/or facing Gurley. Ouch.
Coming into tonight‚Äôs game, Jared Goff: Averaged a league-high 27.6 PPG at home this year. Had just 1 home game this season w/ under 21 points. Eagles allow the 3rd most QB PPG on the road this season. Eagles secondary is basically a bunch of back-ups. This is unreal.
@FieldYates HTTR
And Kelly is back in at RB for LA. On a truly nutty day of football this current game result might be the nuttiest.
Smallwood Henry and Mack. Obviously.
BTW - With Rams heading to the playoffs, wonder if they rest Gurley next week in what should be a relatively easy game at Arizona? Yes Rams have something to play for but longer view ... couldn‚Äôt you see them doing that? Obviously would be a massive story in the fantasy finals.
‚ÄúQuestionable to return‚Äù .... Worst three words in FF? Because if a guy is ruled out at least you know ... but the hope of a return toys with your emotions all game long as the minutes dwindle.
@lmhitman That‚Äôs rough. Ouch.
A team of Andrew Luck, Saquon Barkley, Aaron Jones, Keenan Allen, Adam Thielen, Eric Ebron and then a flex of like Amari Cooper or Corey Davis would have gone undefeated in the regular season. And got destroyed today. Brutal.
Meanwhile James Develin has more catches so far than Edelman and Gronk combined. Sigh.
Text from @all_biz ‚ÄúGreat to see Doug Baldwin blow up two weeks after everyone who drafted him was eliminated.‚Äù
And of course the BACK-UP TE scores. My playoff team with Thielen and Kittle is not enjoying today so far. https://t.co/RiqjUoZk8T
#Fantasyheartbreak as Mullens misses a wide open Kittle on what would have likely been a long TD.... #argh
Congrats, ‚Å¶@ChicagoBears‚Å© https://t.co/Jts0DLHMvU
Josh Johnson undefeated as a Redskins starting QB.
The last player before Derrick Henry to rush for 170 yards AND multiple touchdowns in consecutive games was.... LaDainian Tomlinson (2006)  cc @tunasweasel
Robert Foster over 90 yards in 4 of his past 5.
8.3 point play by Trey Burton. He didn‚Äôt have a GAME with even 5 points since scoring 10 vs DET in Week 10.
@Grn138 Fair
Derrick Henry Weeks 1-13: 95.5 points  Derrick Henry Weeks 14-15: 75.1 points (and counting)  #ofcourse #fantasyfootball
Tevin Coleman Weeks 11-14: 32 carries for 117 yards and 0 TD  Tevin Coleman Week 15: 8 carries for 116 yards and 1 TD.  Because fantasy football. #ofcourse
Derrick Henry having himself a playoff.
@MikeClayNFL Can‚Äôt contact him if you can‚Äôt catch him.
A Ballage Barrage. CC @MikeClayNFL https://t.co/qSL27vngzI
Marlon Mack is 2.5 points shy of totaling as many points today as he had in his previous 3 games. We still have 11 minutes left. In the 3rd quarter. I mean... I know Ryan Kelly is back but come on. #fantasyfootball #ofcourse #wherewasthisallyear
@MikeClayNFL You should watch the Dolphins - Vikings game
Kalen Ballage TO THE HOUSE
Aaron Jones is out for the game. His knee. #Fantasyheartbreak
@BisMishra Ouch
Cohen over 12 points for a 4th straight game. His 5 TD receptions this season are as many as Fitz, Evans and Julio among others. The Tyreek Hill of RBs....
@MikeClayNFL @andyholloway Gonna be a Ballage Barrage
Amazing play by Tarik Cohen - switching arms to get ball over goalline as he is going out of bounds. Touchdown.
@MikeClayNFL Kalen Ballage in against MIN. And looks good.... cc @andyholloway
Derrick Henry with his 10th score of the season. That wouldn‚Äôt have been surprising if you called it in August. But with 6 scoreless games to open the season, this has been a weird year.
Over the last 4 seasons on two players have 6+ rushing scores.  Todd Gurley and....Latavius Murray.
Joe Mixon over 14 points in 4 of his past 5
Matty Ice with his 3rd rushing score of the season. That‚Äôs 3 more than he had the 5 seasons prior.
You can‚Äôt stop, you can only hope to contain Josh Allen. 3rd rushing score in his past 4 games. Ran for 135 yards in the game he didn‚Äôt run one in. And ... #TwoFirstNames #alwaysacrowdpleaser #redzone
Peyton Barber quietly with a rushing score in 4 of his past 5.
More #fantasyheartbreak as Aaron Jones leaves the game and is questionable to return.
Dalvin Cook already has his 4th straight game with over 15.5 points. Been a tough season for those who drafted him at his ADP of 13th overall ... but if you hung tough he is paying off
David Johnson with 55 receiving yards today ... 7 more than he had the month prior. #PassCatchingRBvsATL
Cousins to Diggs TD. 5.6 points on the first drive for Cousins. Already more than halfway to last week‚Äôs total.
I keep trying to tell people.  The team @FantasyLifeApp absolutely crush it https://t.co/9BKYLBNRlq
@FieldYates Agree to disagree
Love @LRiddickESPN https://t.co/ANwN6XitjZ
Love seeing tweets like this https://t.co/Md0Lv674mx
If you were using Lambo as your kicker..... heads up. He is OUT https://t.co/h8JRW9JaQX
T.Y. Hilton is ACTIVE. Since Week 11, he's the 2nd best WR in FF &amp; leads the NFL in rec yards (556). Giddy up.

@clotuscreature Very possibly.
Surprised this is that much in question. Would be an obviously downgrade for Luck. https://t.co/dyQFb6WvSr
Basically makes both Brieda &amp; Wilson unplayable as anything other than desperation flexes https://t.co/WIwrF4ZDJw
@jscott1986 Well, one day after this tweet the Steelers list him as doubtful, so I at least know more than you.
@josehinojosa_5 Easy. Kick him out
@EvilEric_ Cousins was a great fantasy QB last year and outperformed his ADP. What‚Äôs your point?
@Jordyyyy___ This tweet did not age well

So great - amazing cause, amazing community on @FantasyLifeApp https://t.co/mrXYc582It
Cody Kessler vs Josh Johnson. What could go wrong? https://t.co/ZHJcjeLg4u
@ClintonHolmgren @philiplord @chrizmillr There‚Äôs nothing inappropriate about it. There‚Äôs some intense action sequences and lots of bright flashes so if either upsets him that would be the only concern. But it has great heart and a great message. And is a clever re-telling of the Spider-Man story
Would be very surprised if Conner played https://t.co/dwgsjhE96C
Good luck to friends of the podcast &amp; hardcore fantasy players @philiplord &amp; @chrizmillr on the opening of SpiderMan: Into the SpiderVerse this weekend. I‚Äôve seen it - it‚Äôs terrific.
@Kes8514 What's strange about it?
Melvin, we wouldn't be in the playoffs without you and you owe fantasy players absolutely nothing. Your sole focus should be on your health and helping the Chargers win a Super Bowl. But we very much appreciate the sentiment! Look forward to seeing you back out there soon! https://t.co/04sFrZhKms

Crushing blow during the fantasy playoffs.... https://t.co/qVwmXVxyas
We are live now... previewing every game in Week 15 https://t.co/THZvU5OLxz
@FantasyADHD Read through my mentions.  Insanity.
Over 18 points, more than Mahomes plus Tyrell dropped a TD pass that hit him in the hands (Jackson ran in the next play). We can‚Äôt make the plays for them, we can only predict likely opportunity &amp; success. https://t.co/BvcBs0BARO
But at end of the day you got 17 points out of a guy you most likely picked up this week. Almost as much as Mahomes. More than Kelce, Hill, Keenan.  Those that started Jackson should be thrilled.
My TL filled with a bunch of people very angry they started Justin Jackson (my RB13) over Damien Williams (my RB19). If Mahomes rush TD called correctly &amp; Rivers threw a better pass to Jackson on that wheel route, JJ outs have two TD, DW 1. Woulda coulda shoulda - that‚Äôs FF.
@JoelContartese Also brutal. Dropped a TD
(Arnold voice) Go Chargers Go https://t.co/4EIML4Qmer
Unbelievable win. Not the same old Chargers at all. https://t.co/q1EdgZQjYT
Mike Williams out here Derrick Henry-ing playoff teams.
Wow wow wow.
Right? https://t.co/pzi2cCznO1
The amount of shots to the head calls@missed is truly remarkable. https://t.co/Cg51K0yUah
@CarlBasye @JerryBoKnowz I had Williams at 19 - ahead of James White - so that‚Äôs on you. Not my fault you can‚Äôt read rankings correctly.
Really wanted that Mahomes rushing score, for example. Argh https://t.co/yytKenSkkA
This game is nothing but fantasy heartbreak after fantasy heartbreak.
By the way, I went to a screening of SpiderMan: Into the SpiderVerse this week. It‚Äôs terrific. Really really well done. Smart, funny, surprising and clever. If it‚Äôs not a big hit there is no justice.
Good call. https://t.co/ia6odcWSLb

@FieldYates You should start Spencer Ware
Just survive and advance this week and you'll have Melvin next week... https://t.co/i7cFogNQyZ
Just updated my rankings - they should be reflected on the site soon. I have Justin Jackson as RB13 (just behind Lindsay and L Miller) and Damien Williams as RB 19. Both carry some risk, Williams more so. Good luck tonight!
@RossTaylor3_88 I have Lindsay higher
@pizzdaddy would bench Kenny G
@TaylorTwellman I have them ranked Chubb, Jackson, Cohen
@NickRickles Chubb
As expected. Justin Jackson time https://t.co/gxO4UFo700
He's a high end flex to me. https://t.co/kw896pe341
@Langman44 It often makes Christmas movies lists, actually.
@mccord_tim Good argument
@pezloco147 @BillSimmons Love Bill. But we also don't see eye to eye on Lakers-Celtics. That's ok. Our friendship will survive this.
@MSblues601 Don;'t get cute - play Evans
@DeBaugh5 Because sometimes people use the column for DFS - saying you like then to beat a projection helps that
@jdmac999 top 15
@jpizz3 Amazing
@IrishIKnew So It's a Wonderful Life isn's a Christmas movie by your definition? No Santa, no claymation, questionable religious overtones. (An angel, but much more "gaurdian" than religious)
@dadams1616 Should have mentioned that - great point
.@IFC weighs in.... (Note: I will watch at least one showing of this and probably two) https://t.co/QQm6TMZWmm
@TheBoxOfficeGuy JJ and Samuels for me. And thanks!
I have Justin Jackson as a top 15 play tonight. https://t.co/kDqETeqKfb

Williams a legit RB2 consideration. https://t.co/yvVjHL3GCi

Wow. Amazing ‚Äúhook n ladder‚Äù play to get PIT into FG range.... and then FG gets blocked. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.
Damn. Darren Sproles with a helluva move to score a TD. All tied up in Dallas.
Followed by an awful roughing the passer call https://t.co/PQqMyNRC1C
Wow.  Brutal ticky tack offensive interference call on Philly to take a long TD away.
Feels like you don‚Äôt hear that many ppl still complaining about a 1 for Amari Cooper, you know?
Austin Ekeler banged up on CIN onsides kick. Zeke back in the game however.
An unfortunate series of events in Dallas. Zeke and Zack Martin both leave Dallas game with injuries...
Wow. Unbelievable catch by JuJu - think that‚Äôs a TD.
Guy with Kittle also has Pettis. I hate the Broncos defense. https://t.co/hTg1GUy3GG
@tomdice456 Same
George Kittle has 210 receiving yards today. It‚Äôs a SF 49er TE record. And of course... I‚Äôm playing against him. It‚Äôs not even halftime yet. #bitterberry #wtf
In fairness to the Broncos there‚Äôs so many other weapons the Niners have its hard to know which guy to concentrate on. https://t.co/mPTSfTOMMz
Playoff matchup for me where I have Samuels going and I‚Äôm facing Kittle. Kittle with a 85 yard TD. Samuels gets pulled for Ridley at goal line. Tough two minutes for me. #bitterberry
The Miami Miracle  https://t.co/RYV0momY6E
Wow wow wow. Crazy play to end the Patriots Dolphins game. Wait till you see it
Nick Chubb with a rushing score in 5 straight games. He didn‚Äôt have a streak like that over his final 3 seasons at Georgia.
Not only does James Develin vulture a score from Sony Michel he commits a face mask to call back a huge run. Thanks, James Develin.
Josh Johnson baby!
QBs leaders over the past 15 seasons in total number of games with 99+ rushing yards: Vick (11), Wilson (4), Cam (3) and ... Josh Allen (3, in each of the past 3 games).
Julio into the end zone again. All he does is score touchdowns.
And the Josh Joshson era is underway in DC
TEs with 55+ catches and 12+ TD receptions in a season since 2010: Gronk, Graham, Julius Thomas, Gates and ... Eric LEbron
List of teams this season that have allowed 30+ first half points while being shut out:   Redskins, today.   End list.
What an embarrassing performance for the Skins at home. I get they are really beat up but come on.
Brady has already scored more points than in ANY of his past 5 games. There‚Äôs still over 3 minutes left. In the first half.
Gronk scores just to twist the knife of everyone who drafted him early and is sitting at home. Also Brady with 3 touchdown passes for the same reason.
Saquon Barkley with his league leading 5th touchdown of 50+ yards this season. The last RB to do that was prime CJ2K in 2009
His 2 rushing scores today AGAINST the Patriots are double his number WITH the Patriots from 2014-2017 https://t.co/EXPZcZjF7T
Brandon Bolden revenge game! Second time in the end zone today because, fantasy football
A pair of TDs early for Jarvis Landry. Already tied for his 2nd best game of the season with 20.3 points.
Now once every 11.3 touches since. https://t.co/zzUqq93QDc
And Alfred Blue gets one in Houston. https://t.co/O2RMU08j7B
Vultures everywhere. Damien Williams takes one from Ware; Dixon takes one for Gus Edwards.
130+ yards OR a touchdown in 12 of 13 games this season for Davante Adams.
Tyreek Hill on sidelines in a lot of pain. Appears to be his wrist.
Through Week 7, CMC had 1 TD on 118 touches. Scoring once every 12 touches since. Another one today and lots of time left in the first...
James Develin vultures another. #bitterberry
With that catch, CMC now trails only 2014 Emmanuel Sanders when it comes to most catches in a season without a drop over the past decade.

More Sutton: 51.3% of his points this season have come on deep passes. 3 of Denver‚Äôs final 4 games come against a bottom 11 defense in terms of yards per deep pass attempt https://t.co/nZyXXPZzmW
Courtland Sutton is available in 46% of ESPN leagues and would expect him to see an increase in target share.
Just brutal. https://t.co/GXFyV88ouc
Great news https://t.co/xbqFcTk5oN
@4for4_Josh On it. I'll look forward to your ranks.
The power of touchdowns in fantasy football. So, far, Tyler Lockett has 66.1 more fantasy points than Willie Snead. But if you subtract all receiving TDs from both (including the yardage of those scoring catches), Snead actually holds a 16.8-point edge on Lockett this season.

@LateRoundQB @ScottBarrettDFB Can we have a ceremony the day you change your twitter handle?
@hank08088 @Chris_Bird179 @YahooNoise @FranksHouseFTW I would rule before he was on anyone's roster. If he had been rostered earlier in the season I would let it ride. I rule by common sense and most fun - this is a game we play for fun.
Hard to argue with this one.... https://t.co/eCSMgQsi1a
@YahooNoise @FranksHouseFTW I actually agree with Brad here. I don't think he should have been given TE eligibility to begin with - and if I was a commish I wouldn't allow him to be played there - but from Yahoo's POV - once that ship sailed, they can't take away a player's position eligibility mid-season.
Hilarious. Longtime fan of the 06010 podcast, remembering @GabeTheWP's rant about Joe Webb a few years ago predicted a similar situation happening with Jaylen Samuels. On September 6th of this year! Nice call, @AManning85 https://t.co/zadEWEDaEN
Ha. Exactly. https://t.co/zmKA4VYb9C
ACTUALLY...ESPN was the 1st to assign RB eligibilty to Montgomery 2 yrs ago. We did so b/c he was playing majority of his snaps at RB. It was clear it wasn't a 1 time emergency thing. When we did it we actually got tons of criticism from others. Wks later other sites did the same https://t.co/Ll8CgUMTsi
Not on ESPN, no. He's a RB. He was drafted as a RB, he has done nothing but play RB for Pittsburgh all season. He's listed as a RB by the team on their official website. The position he will play this Sunday will be RB, filling in for James Conner, a RB. https://t.co/KbNyDrHecr
I think that is hilarious and an awesome idea that I have actually never heard before. I'll do it. https://t.co/9WudHJwrn3
Taped before the Conner news came out but we still mention Samuels as the #1 RB add. Podcast link below. https://t.co/XjYApKNlrf
Samuels for me. I have Wilson second then Justin Jackson if you need a RB. https://t.co/rIo4nGgUsG
I know it was reported elsewhere as not serious but if he‚Äôs ALREADY been ruled out for this week on early Tuesday, I have to believe the next few weeks are in jeopardy as well. Jaylen Samuels is the obvious top priority on waivers tonight tho you‚Äôll see some Ridley as well. https://t.co/5qyj55ptma
Today on the @fantasyfocus podcast, we are breaking down MNF, talking waiver wire adds and taking an early look at Week 14 projections. We are LIVE now https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI

Kelce‚Äôs third TD is taken off the board as he was down at the 13. But still.... nice day at the office for Mr. Kelce.
#fantasyheartbreak as Chris Carson fails to get in twice from the 1 and then Russell Wilson throws his third TD of the game to Baldwin. If you had Carson and were playing vs Wilson, for one totally random example, that was a brutal turn of events. #bitterberry
Here we go again.  Todd Gurley purposely does NOT go into the end zone on what would have been a long TD
Brutal call at end of INDY-JAX game as a player is called down in bounds when it appears he lands out of bounds. Clock runs out - no chance at a last play to win.
X2 https://t.co/NPYKdz6g3k
65 yarders also qualify. https://t.co/5t9twOuujo
Taylor Decker and Akeem Hicks have touchdowns today. So far Julio has under 20 yards receiving. Because fantasy
Fantasy heartbreak as a 76 yard TD pass from Mayfield to Callaway is called back due to a holding penalty.
Diggs still super risky. https://t.co/8YeI6EK2qu
OBJ the first player with 5 receiving scores AND multiple passing scores in a single season since 2003 Rod Gardner.
Yes, you get points for that Beckham TD PASS.... Footwork needs some work but the ball was on the money. Shepard walks into the end zone.
Kenyan Drake has as many TD catches as rushing scores this season. Still not enough work on the ground to be comfortable with, but his work in the pass game has kept him viable.
From Love Hate this week: ‚Äú43.7% of Lindsay‚Äôs have gained 5+ yards this season‚Äù. That TD run qualifies. Beautiful score from 6 yards out. Broncos up 7-0 with under 2 to go in the first half.
Defensive scores. Lineman touchdowns. Vulture TDs. If you need this week to get into the playoffs.... breathe deep.
#Fantasyheartbreak as Chase Edmunds vultures a TD from David Johnson
Not at halftime yet and 3 D/ST already have scores. Gotta think playoff fates are being determined on the other side of the ball.
Awful https://t.co/COGH6dqByZ
Come on https://t.co/f6HUT1RJrF
All Davante Adams does is produce. TD or 8+ catches in 11 of 12 games this season. How many WRs will be ranked over him this summer?
Brutal https://t.co/XsDPmBEDRH
CMC out here to help. Instead of a 61 yard TD, he gets tripped up. TD reception in the next play, so he‚Äôs worth an extra point and helps Cam as well. In the giving mood during the holiday season.
Lamar Jackson had 10 first quarter fantasy points this season entering today. He‚Äôs already got 8.6 today.
DeVante Parker scores. He had one TD reception in his previous 20 games.  #fantasyfootball
Players with more TD receptions since Week 9 then Adam Humphries ... no one. His 5th score (and counting) in his last 5 games
Sending you good fantasy karma today... Week 13 .... let's do this! https://t.co/W3JisXjRMD

We are moving to ESPN2 at noon for the last hour of #FFNow.. come join
As just discussed on #FFNow, traditionally when Diggs has been on the injury report and played, he has not been great. Even if he plays, he's a very risky start. With it being a 4pm game, I'd start a 1pm option if you have a viable guy. https://t.co/erT49AxzmA

Many questions about Spencer Ware. I have him as RB7 today.   In 2016 Ware avg 97 scrimmage yards per game... In his career Ware has 11 games with over 15 touches. In those games he averages 105 total yards, 5.3 yards per touch, 16.5 fantasy PPG.... OAK is 29th vs run last 4 wks

@dimab549 @fantasyfocus @FieldYates @DanielDopp @Stephania_ESPN I actually love this idea.
With Green off the injury report it‚Äôs worth noting that he has over 110 receiving yards OR a TD in 4 of his past 5 games &amp; over the last 4 wks, DEN has allowed 3rd most WR PPG &amp; are the worst pass defense in the NFL. Risk of re-injury of course &amp; a backup QB but upside is there. https://t.co/p855Iht6nh

In Week 13 last year, Drew Brees has just 14.5 points in ESPN standard scoring. In one of the most crucial weeks of the FF season, another tough game tonight, finishing with 7.3.
Will Drew Brees take the most experienced officiating crew in the NFL off the hook?
Also this https://t.co/0vbYXy8XB2

WTF https://t.co/icf2tNqt2c
Which one of these teams is 10-1 again? Cowboys dominating this game.
@FieldYates I was right. Refs were wrong.
As a Redskins fan and someone with Alvin Kamara on his team, that was an unfortunate turn of events.
That‚Äôs a catch.

@scott_pianowski What was it? Three targets, all scripted, in first half vs DEN and then nothing for a game and a half? And he looks done?
When you see Lamar Miller bust out a 97 yard TD run https://t.co/TcWSjgE7UW
Remember last week when you started Demariyus and he got zero catches &amp; looked completely out of the offense and then you benched him this week? Good times.
@sporer I don‚Äôt enjoy them in the game.
Nice wheels, Jonnu

Some thoughts on Gus Edwards &amp; Josh Adams from The Fantasy Show on ESPN+. https://t.co/N61u61IBOn
@JayFarber Right?
Fantasy Rock Star https://t.co/ZejHbu6IP8
You guys just got housed - at home - by Cleveland. Your defense is terrible. The team should still compete of course but you can compete but be realiatic and smart. All due respect to Driskell I think it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôs Tom Brady. If I was CIN I would shut Green down. https://t.co/AVGjIfAb6d
One other thing ... with CIN now 5-6 and having put their QB on IR, I wonder if we see AJ Green again this year? Why risk your over 30 year old franchise player in a lost year with a back-up QB? Green has played all 16 games just twice in last 5 years (including this yr) https://t.co/hQKaCkhyeE
Driskell‚Äôs mobility will offer some  appeal in 2QB leagues or deeper leagues. https://t.co/hQKaCkhyeE

If you‚Äôd like to share my misery, here‚Äôs the current matchup. It‚Äôs the ESPN Staff league &amp; I‚Äôm playing @_JimmyMcCormick. Have Zeurlein on a bye so Bailey, indoors, high scoring game seemed to make sense as a bye week fill-in. Of course, if his K doesn‚Äôt THROW A TD I already win. https://t.co/RnxWVjcxDT
@aystin43 Correct. He‚Äôs got a zero right now
Heading into tonight‚Äôs SNF, I‚Äôm down 157.7 to 154.4 in a deep 12 team league. Guy I‚Äôm playing is done. I have Dan Bailey left. It‚Äôs minus one for missed FG‚Äôs or extra points. Suffice to say.... I‚Äôm am .... let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúnot happy‚Äù at the moment.  #bitterberry
Great googly moogly Adam Thielen.
@FieldYates Duh
Probably easier if you stop following me. https://t.co/cFWPFQJQxn
Sometimes Field and I subtly shake our heads at each other after a tough podcast. So sames https://t.co/R1FsIzYUrQ
Well this game ain‚Äôt boring
Finally freed a few games ago. Only took us half the year, Aaron Rodgers begging for him to be used more and the Packers losing games they shouldn‚Äôt to make it happen. https://t.co/9D3tvpKRV1
Remember when Mike McCarthy refused to give work to Aaron Jones? Lol.  The next Packers coach will certainly feature him from Day 1.
@FieldYates You‚Äôre the one they hold?
Do we get a point for that? https://t.co/czgBdzGn1a
On #FFNow this morning I discussed how I didn‚Äôt understand how Austin Ekeler wasn‚Äôt rostered in 100% of leagues since obviously Melvin Gordon was. Hopefully you have Ekeler should this turn out as initially feared or worse. Justin Jackson would also see some run if MG is out. https://t.co/z1zrkF7ANG
Stay tuned. Not ideal but obviously could be worse. Fingers crossed. https://t.co/z1zrkF7ANG
Eric Ebron is the bane of my existence.
Holding his arm https://t.co/DLV5aOTOVG
Man is Phillip Lindsay fun to watch. That is all.
Randall Cobb is OUT tonight... Jimmy Graham is active.
Ju-Ju to the house house. 99 yard touchdown catch. Unreal.
Oh man. Melvin Gordon gets hit hard on the knee and is now down....
Rivers is now 20 for 20 with 203 yards and 2 TDS. Unreal.
Christian McCaffrey, obv. https://t.co/wQFgD0GLn4
Props to those of you who shrugged of Melvin Gordon usage concerns due to injury / game flow. Two scores &amp; 19 points with 2 min left in the first half.
Fantasy heartbreak for a Ben TD pass as Grimble fumbles out of the end zone.
Remember in the preseason when people were worried about McCaffeey‚Äôs usage? And CJ Anderson? Lol.
19.4 yards per catch this season for Moore. 5 TD catches in his past 7 games. https://t.co/0tO4ypA8wy
David Moore is something special
Plenty of time left today, but as it stands, Sony Michel is averaging 20 PPG when getting at least 15 carries. #LeagueWinner
Adam Humphries has 4 TD catches in his past 4 games
Josh Adams redemption as he gets in from 1! #joshadamsfreed
4 straight games of over 15.5 points for Julian Edelman.
TD reception in 8 of 11 games for Tyler Lockett this season. Had 9 career TD receptions entering this season

Zach Ertz with a score or at least 9 catches in 7 of his past 8 games. #hesgood. #analysis
Saquon Barkley had a 50-yard run in September. He had one in October. Waited until his final game of November, but he got it
Fournette now with 5scores (and counting) in his 3 games since returning.
4 touchdowns (and counting) in the past 4 games for Curtis Samuel.
Baker Mayfield over 16 points for a 3rd straight game. If you‚Äôre wondering ... he gets these Bengals again in Week 16.
Since he returned, Fournette has a rushing TD in every game.
Fantasy heartbreak as a long run by Sony Michel is called back by penalty.
Antonio Callaway scores. We are less than an hour into today and there are already 4 touchdowns scored by players started in less than 1.5% of leagues. A continuation of ‚ÄúMostly Useless Thanksgiving‚Äù (Callaway, Foster, McKenzie and Kearse score).
Gronk lives! 34 yard TD pass from Brady
Jameis Winston loves his little Cameron Brate. He has accounted for 28.6% of Winston‚Äôs TD passes since the beginning of last season. #makeAmericaBrateagain
Fantasy heartbreak as long TD run is called back by penalty.
Nick Chubb already with 5 touches and a score. Possible to have a 3rd straight game with 20+ carries and a rush TD. Since the beginning of last season, only Hunt and Zeke have had such a streak.
Up to 10 straight games for Saquon Barkley with at least 7 points as a pass catcher.
Just heard me discuss Josh Adams on #FFNOW... we've only been talking about him for 2 months now, but today might be the day he's finally freed.  My RB16 today-avg 7 ypc since wk 8, saw 6 targets last wk, NYG allowing 152 rush yards a gm last 4 weeks. Still avail in 35% of lgs.
@GreggColli @FieldYates @tthasselbeck @ESPNFFNow Gus
Gus Edwards, 50% available in ESPN leagues, is now my RB12 today https://t.co/UTeRb9wK9P
Whoa. Gus Edwards rides again in a significant way. Will be heavily rostered in DFS... https://t.co/PrLsfTXI3i
#FFNow moves to ESPN2 in 2 minutes..... Come find us!
2/2 rookie WR's today ...W/ Adams shadowed by Rhodes + Graham banged up I'm hopeful MVS breaks out of his slump tonight....David Moore had a season high 8 targets last week - does Baldwin play &amp; is he effective? And is today the Courtland Sutton breakkout we've been waiting for?
Could rookie WR's play a big role today? DJ Moore (45% avail) -at least 5 targets in 5 of his last 6... SEA allows 8th most yards after the catch....Keke Coutee is 75% avail (led HOU in tar &amp; rec yds last wk, ran 3 more routes than DT last wk)... 1/2
#FFNOW is on ESPNEWS right now... will be on ESPN2 at 10:30am ET....

I mean... https://t.co/Qx4DjTLYAc
I've been sitting in front of my computer tryin gto do prep for tomorrow's #FFNow and haven;t got one thing done for 30 minutes. This  #LSUvsTAMU game is bat$#%&amp; crazy
I'm sure a lot of the conversation after this game will be about the officiating and I get it but this is one of the all-time great college catches, especially given the stakes at the time. https://t.co/0bxxdMplXH
There are no words for this game. #LSUvsTAMU
@jberry100 This game is unbelievable
Actually, the last 6 minutes of this LSU/A&amp;M game is straight up insanity.
@FieldYates https://t.co/fXGvoURP3E

@chrisharrisbaby @30for30 Highly doubt people would start them in a standard 10 team season long fantasy league, which is the point of the joke.
Mizzell. V Davis. Quinn. Bibbs. Lewis. Carr. Arnold. Kirkwood. Look forward to the @30for30 on today. ‚ÄúWhat if told you there was a day where almost every touchdown was useless.‚Äù
Genuine question @NFLOfficiating .... how is this not a penalty? https://t.co/O7mWQhntjP
I mean.... https://t.co/udwNVHrkX9
Just for the Redskins. https://t.co/lk6aiX4G7I
I mean seriously. How many calls can one ref crew miss? Helmet to helmet on Reed. And Colt got thrown to the ground after he released the ball on previous play. Redskins secondary has been brutal but you‚Äôd still like a game to be called fairly.
@Arod000562 All true. Still PI.
And of course THAT tug doesn‚Äôt get called. Awful.
Skins Secondary has not played well - especially Moreau - but man there‚Äôs been some ticky tack stuff today. https://t.co/jcCcIK5EGC
@TT_Beatz Ouch. Sorry to hear man
Good lord this is embarrassing. Someone make a tackle on this team.
@PDXSween Hahaha. Glad it worked out.
@evansilva https://t.co/XGmnGNyOhi
Whoa. Tre‚ÄôQuan Smith is INACTIVE for tonight.
This https://t.co/PkPBPjojow
We discussed Trey Quinn on the pod this week....they LOVE him in Washington. If Crowder is not back with the Skins next year, a big reason why will be Trey Quinn.
@LS1_Seamonkey I under stand the concept and am aware of it. I just don‚Äôt like it.
Colt McCoy to Vernon Davis! Haven‚Äôt seen a connection like that since Daniel to Mizzell! (I‚Äôll take it tho. Also, I‚Äôm on team Colt is not a downgrade).
I don‚Äôt like the idea of multiple Spidey‚Äôs. Just saying.
.@Tress_Way for MVP
@OrtizzleSD That show and Mad Money with @jimcramer were definite inspirations, as was Avenue Q.
Definitely an upgrade for Skins secondary if Dunbar can go https://t.co/7mQb8yZ9CC
Under 4 yards a carry and two scores. The ultimate LeGarrette Blount game.
Happy Thanksgiving from The Fantasy Show on ESPN+ https://t.co/WEDf8hDuDM
@JordanTChong @minakimes ALWAYS
Just like we all expected, that Daniel / Mizzell stack starting to pay off.

Today‚Äôs 06010 pod: Week 12 preview .... https://t.co/XnGaWs5JPp
As expected. Theo Riddick went 6 rec for 60 last time they played CHI... now no Tate, Jones or Kerryon (17 receptions the last 4 weeks). The way CHI brings pressure, expect a lot of dump offs to Theo. Very viable flex play this week. Avail in 65% of leagues. https://t.co/1GN9PZXxhO
@FieldYates Yes, that is how you should rank him.
Mistakes? You‚Äôve made a few. It‚Äôs the 2018 edition of Don‚Äôt Look Back in Anger. #LOVEHATE for Week 12 is now posted. https://t.co/ktzTBcSd8t
In a week where you face Odell that seems... less than ideal. https://t.co/AJbfqlPYFB
Have to downgrade all CHI pass catchers - we haven‚Äôt seen Daniel play this year &amp; just too much unknown. And while they may try to run more it‚Äôs worth noting since DET traded for Harrison they are a Top 12 rush D in terms of rush yards allowed per game &amp; yards per carry against. https://t.co/nfWNJKlChh
@lawrmichaels Hang tough Lawr!
@jayden_tucker_3 @fantasyfocus @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN Appreciate you. Daniel Dopp‚Äôs nickname is Secret Squirrel. They are the same person. Also the show is called Fantasy Focus Football. Those details are incorrect in your paper.... good luck with it!

So, was it good for you?
Freak
So if the Over / Under had been set at 100, you'd have still hit on the over. Got it.
ARE YOU KIDDING????
I mean.... https://t.co/5O9Ek1legU
Come on Rams. Score quick so KC can get a FG and let's go to OT.
Can Jimmy Pitaro just go hand these guys the ESPY for best game right now?
That dumb touchdown to Everett just clinched me a win in a deep 14 teamer where I have Gronk on a bye and there was nothing on the waiver wire. God I love fantasy football.
Totally thought there'd be 3 defensive touchdowns tonight
Whoa, Tyree---oops. He's already gone.
If you benched the Rams D/ST because you were worried about negative points, raise your hand....
Just a reminder. No matter how the rest of this game goes, you are NOT allowed to complain about Todd Gurley. https://t.co/UuhqWblL6c
That was a dime... and then disappointing
Problem with this game is that every time you go to tweet something about an amazing play or moment, another one happens ...
And we are off. Last one with the ball wins?

@ScottBarrettDFB Well done
Oh good. The Aldrick Robinson score we‚Äôve all be waiting for
This was at end of HOU-WSH game. No idea how this isn‚Äôt PI. Should have been called &amp; then it‚Äôs a chip shot FG to win the game instead of a 63 yarder. I mean - this is pretty blatant. https://t.co/6ETgZe6xjL
Is that good? That seems good. https://t.co/rcdK95aUaB
No one with James Conner is allowed to complain this year. You‚Äôre just not. https://t.co/i9fI8ZEey5
Shocked by how poorly Wentz - and the entire Eagles offense - played in this game.
Fantasy heartbreak as a long TD run by David Johnson is called back by a holding penalty on Ricky Seals-Jones
Crazy https://t.co/GRnpDLCsi5
Stop me if you‚Äôve heard this one before. Drew Brees to Michael Thomas. Beautiful throw. Touchdown.
Awful https://t.co/oqsnFj2DjP
How was that not pass interference in the Skins game?
Cam gets rolled from behind. Leaving the fileld but under his own power.
1/1 for a TD for Colt McCoy!
Just awful. Alex Smith being carted off.
Jordan Reed turned out and then turned back-obvious that Smith didn‚Äôt expect that. Not sure who that INT is on but brutal goal to go turnover regardless. 14 point swing for WSH. Texans up 17-10.
TY Hilton with 100 receiving yards and a TD for the first time in more than a calendar year.
Not a lot of people are talking about it but Tress Way is having an amazing year. Another great punt, this time down inside the five.
20+ carries or a rush TD in 6 of 8 games for Mixon this season. Only exceptions were blowout losses to KC/NO
And there you have it ... the first Buccaneer with multiple rush TDs this season. Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Saquon Barkley didn‚Äôt score in his previous 2 games. But then it‚Äôs my week to play him in the ‚ÄúESPN War Room‚Äù league. Issue fixed. 2 scores already today. #ofcourse #bitterberry
Fine start for Lamar Jackson (46 rushing yards). 23.3 points for Tebow in his first start. Not out of the question at all for Jackson today...
TD in 4 of 5 games for Greg Olsen after Funchess drops a chance.
Saquon Barkley has just 4.2 points as a pass catcher in Week 1. Since then, at least 7 points as a pass catcher in every game. Back at it again today.
Ok, I'm as excited as the next guy on Jackson. I'm starting him in a deep league. But let's not get crazy. You're starting Goff. I have Jackson as QB14 this week. https://t.co/SFZqZhgXUm

Bengals have allowed the second most rushing TD's by QB's this season. They have allowed 500 yards in three straight games. It may not always be pretty but Lamar Jackson is in a position to have a very nice fantasy day.
#FFNow will be on ESPNEWS at 10am ET today. Then we switch to ESPN2 at 11am ET for the final two hours. Come find us! And if you have a trade question, tweet it at us using #FFNow

On ESPN the average difference between teams that drafted Gurley vs Bell?  Gurley: 3rd place, have scored 1187.2, won 5.8 gms.  Bell: 6th place, have scored 1029.9 pts, won 3.8 gms.   In short, Gurley teams have on average 2 more wins, are playoff bound, &amp; have scored more points
LeVeon goes into the fantasy football record book as the worst draft pick in the history of the game. https://t.co/NagYestPgM

Case in point. I care. Interviewed him once. Very nice kid. He‚Äôs a human being with hopes and dreams that he worked his whole life for. And drafted to a different team, a different organization, handled differently, who knows? He played in the NFL for 2 years. He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äústink‚Äù https://t.co/g3FO9RAQkO
Feel genuinely bad for Peterman. Never given any real support or put into any kind of situation to succeed, he was set up to fail. People are very dismissive, especially on social media, but the worst player in the worst team in the NFL-whoever that is-is a world class athlete.

With 7 min left and trailing NE sent in Brian House and waved the white flag. Don‚Äôt often see that.
38 points for the Bills today. With plenty of time left. They had 37 points in the entire month of October.  #ofcourse
And Spencer Ware vultures Kareem Hunt. Good times.
First game with a TD reception and a TD rush in the NFL for Fournette
Randall Cobb and Chris Carson both INACTIVE
David Johnson with 26.9 points. Season high. If all he needed was an explosive opponent, this could be a big stretch run. AZ still has LAC, GB, ATL and LAR on the schedule.
Nick Chubb. First player with 3 TD runs of 40+ in a single season since Adrian Peterson in 2015. He‚Äôs good. #analysis
Nick Chubb has scored in 3 of 4 games since the Hyde trade. This team on a screen pass. Volume and scores. Good combo.
We are in Week 10 ... And the number of incomplete Michael Thomas targets (9) is hardly greater than his TD receptions (7).
Playing @tthasselbeck @Hasselbeck in the ‚ÄúESPN War Room‚Äù league today. They have Brees, Kamara and Ebron. Been a lot of fun sitting next to them today so far. Oh yeah. Lots of fun.
Four touchdowns now to Colts TE. None of them to Jack Doyle.
Eric Ebron has as many multi-TD reception games this season as games without a TD catch (2). Entering this season, he had 0 multi-TD reception games and 45 games without a TD reception.
Talked on the pod this week that we expected Fournette to be the guy immediately. 13 carries already and now a score.
Kamara throws up the X for Dez Bryant after his 10th rush TD of the season. 8 of those rush TDs have come in his last 5.5 games (not to mention 2 receiving scores).
For a player like Julio, crazy that this is just his 3rd career TD catch from the 1-yard line. But, a TD in consecutive games is impossible to argue with from him.
Absolute awful fantasy heartbreak as New England gets in... no Brady, no White, no Michel, no Gordon or Edelman..... James Develin from in close. Arghhh
Hat trick for Eric Ebron. Another receiving TD - his third of the game - there‚Äôs 9:19 left in the 2nd qtr.
Does Matt Barkley go into the Hall of Fame as a Bill?
People with Jack Doyle on the their roster watching Ebron catch a TD and then run for another like... https://t.co/SDgY2rNLnA
Allen Robinson already with a season-high 18.8 points. I thought taking away WR1s was the one thing @DanielDopp‚Äôs terrible Lions could do. Apparently not.
6 scores (and counting) for David Johnson in his past 7 games. No, he‚Äôs not what you thought you were getting, but at least he‚Äôs viable weekly, amirite LeVeon guys?
Brees/Thomas just ridiculous. Fooled no one on that play, still 6 points. Thomas has caught 89.2% of his targets this season.
Josh Gordon now with a 40+ yard reception in 3 of his past 4 games. Finding his rhythm. Watch out.
Tarik Cohen with a rushing score. That‚Äôll work. Well on pace to go for at least 18 points for the 5th time in his past 6 games
Ebron scores. Again. Has found the end zone in 7 of 9 games this season. 8 TD catches this season (had 11 in his career with DET).
Tyreek Hill sets a career high with his 8th TD catch of the season. Reminder ... it‚Äôs Week 10. Also - there less than a minute of the game expired.
And in Week 10, LeSean McCoy scores his first TD of the season.
Some thoughts on LeVeon Bell https://t.co/jTam6tormG
#FFNow moves to ESPNEWS... starting NOW
Seattle leads NFL in rush percentage this year. Mike Davis, still avail in 62% of ESPN lgs, will be the primary RB w/ Carson out. Hehas had 13+ touches 3 times this year: Avg 20.5 FPPG. Had 7 receptions last wk - Rams have allowed 5th most RB receptions this year. Top 15 play. https://t.co/0mk0oMbtnv

Marquez Valdes-Scantling.... + 100 yards or a TD in 4 straight + 40+ reception in 3 straight (longest active streak in NFL) + MIA has allowed 9 40+ yard completions this yr (2nd most) + I expect Xavien Howard on Adams  + GB runs 3 or more WR sets on 74% of plays.
A bit of channel hopping today.... #FFNow is on ESPN2 at 10am ET - stays there for 90 minutes. Then at 11:30am ET it‚Äôs on ESPNEWS until kickoff at 1pm. Life on a sports network with live events. Appreciate you staying with us! Let‚Äôs get you a win in Week 10.

@jjehrmann Fair point.
@AllbrightNFL Sounds about right.

@Mandy_Willard1 Fine, Willard. You take this round. Long way to go.
Maurice Harris once again a desperation flyer. With beat up O Line and scoring from TB‚Äôs side I expect a lot of passes and many of them short. It‚Äôs the Skins so this is high risk territory but for the desperate among you he is a viable Hail Mary. https://t.co/71ALp3CFox
Jets obviously in play as a viable streamer D/ST https://t.co/su1WTZzZnU
@BillyMcLane Stats are taken only from active ESPN leagues (not the auto draft abandoned types) and with literally millions upon millions of leagues there is a wide variety of experience &amp; intensity level. Don‚Äôt judge FF is for fun and to be played by all levels of experience.
@j_allday94 Hear you but I explained why when I wrote about it. FWIW i feel article and TV show are two very different experiences with different analysis (ie - Tedy Bruschi‚Äôs weekly analysis isn‚Äôt in the column, for example but he‚Äôs on the show every Thursday.
Vampire leagues are going well. Split the games last week. Zeke (who I vampired 2 weeks ago) getting no touches in 2nd half vs TEN caused me to lose 1 gm by 5 but won other game easily &amp; was able to steal Mahomes. Both teams are 4-5 &amp; 1 game out of playoffs. Like both tms a lot. https://t.co/ORo8J6Td44
@Shawn_Edwards @KyleSoppeESPN ‚ÄúScott‚Äù has offered to talk to anyone that is struggling and/or has dealt with this issue in the past. Email me at MatthewBerry TMR at gmail and I will put you in touch with him
@evansilva @FanDuel I play in two super flex leagues and love it.
@clintpardue Wow. This might be the kindest thing anyone has ever said to me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true but I‚Äôm honored and touched for it to even be a thought.
TE available in more than 50% of ESPN leagues that could be usable tomorrow if Gronk doesn‚Äôt go (in this order) ... Uzomah, Watson, Vanett, Seals-Jones. Worth noting Jack Doyle still out there in 30% of leagues. I‚Äôd choose him over all these guys if avail. https://t.co/Omf1tgIE2e

Get out of a meeting with your boss and all hell breaks loose. Lamar Jackson was already picked up in a lot of my leagues but if he is out there in yours, very much worth a flier in case Flacco misses real time. Would be a terrific fantasy QB. https://t.co/uaK0Uu1OAp

Bills this week, then a bye.  So not a great schedule. But if you're in a 2QB league, or deep league with severe bye week issues and need a guy, I expect Josh McCown to be ok until Darnold returns. Like in the 13-15 points a game range this week https://t.co/yudcfOMFMC
Falcons D quietly getting healthier and better.... https://t.co/SYU9piTEwT
The Dez I saw last year isn't. But I guess we will see. https://t.co/w0ZrvcFFbn
Big name and a great QB, so I get it, but I think this is much more about WR depth for New Orleans and not much else. Not rushing out to pick him up. BEST case scenario is he's 4th option in passing game after Thomas, Kamara &amp; TreQuan. And you've got Watson there.... not for me. https://t.co/VRZhNWQYMY
AWESOME https://t.co/1DUAjtkz5S
ICYMI, @fieldyates did a whole BTS video of his magazine cover shoot. It was, ahem, something. So of course #TheFantasyShow on ESPN+ decided to do a shot for shot remake. At least that was the intention. https://t.co/bLWH7CdVGC

Some news before you hit the waiver wire tonight. Cordarelle Patterson has added RB positional eligibility on @ESPNFantasy, which means he is now eligible to play at both WR or RB.
This is an excellent way to frame it. https://t.co/bipWXQodko
@CryptoSteve88 @TomScibelli @BSSAdvisors Please. I‚Äôm a fan.
@EricRey90 @YankeeSoccer1 @TomScibelli @BSSAdvisors 100%. I totally cop to Pee-Wee‚Äôs Playhouse being an inspiration. Mentioned it all the pre-show publicity.

@TomScibelli @BSSAdvisors Also it‚Äôs one of the reasons Daniel says ‚Äúnot again‚Äù in the bit from today. BTW - no spanking in ours though. Liked yours better.
@TomScibelli Hey Tommy: I HATE ppl who rip off stuff. Someone did it to me last wk so I get it. We originally did horse bit a week ago on our Tues Oct 30 show (notice the Halloween decorations), so obviously before Sun‚Äôs @BSSAdvisors.

Redskins injuries are a huge loss, especially for Adrian Peterson's fantasy value, who is also without Trent Williams for 3 more games.

We are recapping all of the Week 9 action now LIVE on the @fantasyfocus podcast. From Nick Mullens‚Äô performance to Josh Gordon‚Äôs best game with New England, we are touching on everything you need to know NOW: https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
Bump https://t.co/tf7ryU1Gi8
I mean.... #freeaaronjones https://t.co/PqEtm9Xnw3
When you have Brady, White, Edelman and Gordon going in various leagues &amp; Cordarrelle Patterson scores a rushing TD up the middle... because life is unfair &amp; fantasy football reminds you of that every single week.
Julio Jones finally gets into the end zone. And of course, it‚Äôs against my Skins.
Adam Humphries (over 95% available) had 9 targets in Week 7, 10 in Week 8 and scored his first two TD‚Äôs of the season today.
And just like that he‚Äôs back. Of course. https://t.co/h3psdyGN2K
New coaching staff, new results for Duke Johnson. 28.7 points (and counting) today after being held under 6 points in 6 of his first 8 games this season.
Big Ben tackles hard in BALT... still down on the ground. Looked bad.
Kareem Hunt over 29 points for the 3rd time in 4 weeks. Only RBs with 3 such games ALL OF LAST SEASON: Kamara, Gurley, Ingram and Bell. #rideordie
Kelce with his 5th game of 19+ points this season. List of TEs with at least 5 such games in a season since 2016: Gronk, Kelce and Kelce
Melvin Gordon, Chris Carson are ACTIVE... as expected Royce Freeman is OUT.
Nathan Peterman entered this week with 108 passing yards and a TD for the season. After the first half today, he has 108 yards and 2 TDs to his opponents this season.
It‚Äôs been ugly but that‚Äôs now 9 rush TDs for Jordan Howard in his last 11 games.
Duke Johnson TD.... He LIVES!
I actually feel bad for Peterman. https://t.co/Ws9jKzj997
Remember in the preseason when folks were worried about C.J. Anderson? CMC now has 4 in the last 6 quarters as he punches it in from in close.
On the podcast this week, @FieldYates and I bet who would account for more TD‚Äôs this week. Nathan Peterman (FY) or the Bears D/ST (me). I‚Äôm up 2-0.
Ito Smith has scored in 4 of his last 5 games. This looks pretty close to a split so far ... CC @FieldYates
Mahomes came into the week averaging 1.3 more first half PPG than any other QB. 2 TD passes and 14.6 points already. Just can‚Äôt stop him.
Rush TD in 3 straight games for Jordan Howard. Still not efficient, but we‚Äôll happily take it.
James Conner is now halfway to a 4th straight multi-TD effort. Would be the first RB to do that since Steven Jackson at the end of the 2006 season. #leveonwho?
Kareem Hunt with more TD receptions than rush TDs this season. At this moment, he has as many TD receptions this season as Adam Thielen (6). #rideordie
And when CMC isn‚Äôt getting vultured by his fullback. Argh.
And now it‚Äôs being ruled a Murray TD. Weird. https://t.co/2QgXNYfrhL
It‚Äôs Rudolph‚Äôs first score since Week 3 and puts him less than 2 points from his best fantasy game since Week 5. Without a catch. This could be a fun Sunday https://t.co/26fb0wHXDR
Wow. Fantasy heartbreak (or miracle?).... Latavius Murray appears to get over goal line but fumbles....recovered by Kyle Rudolph. Rudolph gets the TD.

@alexrkonrad Treadwell. Just no idea what we get from Enunwa... He got one limited practice in this week.
On a bye this week but obviously this is very concerning - start thinking about alternative plans https://t.co/JWl8ncgmHs
Kenny Stills is ACTIVE https://t.co/A0ytFTZLka
Alex Collins is IN; Ty Montgomery is out for BAL
I've never been the biggest Treadwell fan but if ever there was a game for him to do it....(Personally would only use him as a cheap DFS GPP play) https://t.co/TOC9tdFVXv
Diggs and Allen Robinson are OUT
Falcons have allowed 3 receiving TD's in 5 of 7 games this year... 3 different TE's have scored at least 12 points vs ATL... is this Jordan Reed's week? Kinda think it is.

FWIW... In the 14 team PPR celeb league we do for the pod (my only team with Gronk)... I'm benching Gronk and playing Herndon today against @AnnaKFaris @SimSarna ... There's nothing on waivers so I prefer Herndon than trying to replace Gronk tonight or Monday. https://t.co/fpXrjMstq4
@builtfordtasty Bench McCoy
@dmdm22 Ingram &amp; Crow tho I also think Cooler has a nice game
That's a lot of articles, but you have to balance your Fantasy lineup selections objectively. Probably a good thing you're consulting @IBMWatson since Daniel is ahead of you in this league! #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner #ad https://t.co/uC4r8NKlav
@TheOnlyJenSmith Congrats and good luck with it

@minakimes Thanks for the heads up. Don‚Äôt have an up to date depth chart. Who‚Äôs his handcuff? Do you have, like, a goldfish or something?
Entirely a gut call but no, I do not think he plays. I‚Äôm also really worried about Gronk. I would have other options ready. https://t.co/HPS6arkUpC

This is ‚Å¶@MackNova‚Å© who has been the primary researcher on The Fantasy Show since we started. Today was his last show as he‚Äôs taking a job w/ESPN in LA. He‚Äôs an AMAZING researcher &amp; better person. A huge part of the success of the show. I will miss him greatly. GOOD LUCK!!! https://t.co/GnOyqH4ybK
The opposite. At least he got an actual carry in a NFL game. Like he has every game this year. #exceptone #onestupidpoint https://t.co/6Kks2yBJDQ
Yeah they will! Mullens for MVP! Trade Jimmy G! How many jerseys has @Stephania_ESPN ordered? https://t.co/uQ4XxZeOQw
All Garcon needed was a third string QB, obv.
@drturkelton51 @The_real_Jobby @Nike Now see... why does Josh have to slide into your DM‚Äôs? Make it EASY for someone to help you. You contact him. Ask what is best way to contact him. Etc etc. Make it EASY.
@justjoemorose @ryanspoon Should also hit up @themikefoss
Hahaha. Thanks. Love the initiative. And as a matter of fact... I do. My buddy @The_real_Jobby does a great job @Nike ... Yo Josh, will you talk to this guy? https://t.co/JmatioLFZZ
@FantasyFBStoner Halftime
He's RB21 for me but man oh man is he risky. Just depends what your other options are and your tolerance for risk. I have a weird feeling Mullens won't be terrible tonight but obv well within realm of possibility. Here are my current wk9 RB ranks: https://t.co/otjlOoon9F https://t.co/FokJ28HNwr
Lots of Breida questions in my TL. Here's the thing: It's a total crapshoot. He could be awesome vs OAK's 29th ranked run D (last 4 wks). He's also really hurt, playing on a short week, for Kyle S (watch Morris get 20 carries), they could get down big, he could get hurt again...
@_jonathanmejia Brieda is such an unknown. I'd go Mark Ingram
@TheDrewMelton I do, yeah

Eric Hipple https://t.co/ALZRDvLb0J
Mullens has never thrown a NFL pass. Vs OAK that may not matter but, FF is often about limiting unknowns. Kittle the only 49er I feel comfortable starting tonight given the position. The SF RB's, Goodwin...could be great but too much unknown for me to risk unless you are stuck.
Awful news. RIP https://t.co/UrLZuZvkEC
Look alive, Louisiana! Let's get this done. https://t.co/U13PXl4xE3
"Pessimism about Thompson." It'll be the Adrian Peterson show but with 6 teams on a bye and the Falcons brutal defense, Kapri Bibbs could be a viable bye week desperation play for deeper leagues. https://t.co/PeJNgA0JHe
Do you know what month it is? On #TheFantasyShow on ESPN+ .... we do. https://t.co/N3fUBUU0q3
@OsheaJacksonJr @Goolie64359096 But given your RB depth, you‚Äôre definitely not crazy.
@OsheaJacksonJr Nah. I always like getting the best player in a deal and you did this here. Boils down to Fitz. If he‚Äôs the guy we saw last week, you gave up too much. If he‚Äôs the guy we saw all yr long before  last wk I love the deal for you. AP is amazing but there is the fear of wearing down.
@WillBrinson @Port88 Hahaha

@MikeClayNFL @FMLKevin @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @DanielDopp Us too! We drove by a cop with a rifle and we were like... uh, that seems excessive for making sure kids stay out of the street... and then we got the alert and we were like.... oh.
This and the little "headless" girl costume win Halloween this year. https://t.co/TTIyeqtEFR
@joeinthealtima No. DJ's sked gets much easier in 2nd half
More info on Diggs' injury... sounds minor but what do I know? https://t.co/LueyEm3eXl
Fun idea, guys. https://t.co/LYYmIAEeCU
@ChrisFalco1126 Totally makes sense. Figure I'll be a little blocky. Good luck in Week 9!
@TommyG Exactly. Never said he was a good NFL QB. But in that game, that offense, with that matchup, he should have a huge fantasy day. He just played awfully. Cincy did nothing on D. Winston just missed people badly. All day. Fitz was a top 10 QB in 1.5 QTRS. Just JW worst day as a pro
Even being pulled he still outscored Brees. Wk 8 Was it a mistake to start Brees? Threw for 276/TD + almost had a 2nd but Humpries down on 1. Yes he turns ball over but that helps lead to junk time. What in that video is wrong BEFORE the fact? So weird ppl keep harping on this.
Yeah ppl keep throwin this one in my face, It's weird. I make plenty of bad calls but this wasn't one of them. Didn't pan out of course, but before this game, as a starter (Wk 6+7) he was QB2 in FF. Vs a bottom 4 pass + scoring D.? 71 pts were scored in that gm. Process&gt;results. https://t.co/JlZ0wHjjfC
@ChrisFalco1126 @ESPNFantasy It's from last week.
Whoa. Dalvin back to tease us? Hmm.  Let's see what rest of week brings. But a good sign he's out on a Wednesday. Not worried about Diggs until we get later in the week.... Good stuff, @CourtneyRCronin ...now if you'll excuse me I have to re-write my Latavius Murray write-up. https://t.co/bhNmXaMiVq
@ClintDeHaven Assuming there was no collusion then trade should stand. That's ONLY reason for a veto. ONLY.
@FieldYates Yes but only if your homework is done.
This is a great list. 100% agree w/ all. Would add: Seahawks committing to run (&amp; doing it well!), Thielen's emergence into best WR in NFL convo, CIN O turnaround - esp Mixon &amp; Boyd and, of course, MAHOMES. Knew he'd be really good, didn't expect HISTORIC. https://t.co/GwephFu2uh
@FieldYates Remember - you have to be back by 8, you're only allowed to eat five pieces tonight and we're brushing your teeth twice before bed.
@GooseGrinder Well, @MikeClayNFL is the WR/CB matchup creator and guru so he can correct me if I am wrong here but my belief is that, so far, Howard rarely travels to cover the slot and that's where Enunwa has played the majority of snaps.
@GrahamBarfield Good context. And agreed.
@DBro_FFB He has been but I'm banking on volume here and them moving him around. Six teams on a bye - gotta lower expectations!
@NoiseGateStudio @garbagemandave You didn't have to like it, but I assure you notihng about my rant was manufactured. Wasn't written, wasn't planned, just came out.
In a week with 6 teams on a bye, this is actually reasonably big and good news, especially against Miami - would not expect Howard on Enunwa, assuming he plays. https://t.co/MqN4dPRcjw
@awfulannouncing Thanks for the love.
@FFHitman @jasonffl @LateRoundQB Well, if you do anything else with "Jeff" feel free to use if you like.
@FFHitman @jasonffl @LateRoundQB Very fair.
@jasonffl @LateRoundQB Pitch for you guys: Not sure if you guys are still doing your pod or doing anytthing else with Jeff but "he" totally should have left halway through the pod. "Well, it's clear this job is done." And then let Andy/Mike carry it rest of way.
@friscojosh My fave line of Olbermann's
@friscojosh we are all.... day to day.
@jasonffl @LateRoundQB https://t.co/30T1nlgl1b
By all accounts, he is a great "locker room" addition as well. Think that is an under reported aspect of this Redksins team (though @john_keim) has definitely written about it).... Feels like a strong locker room, full of guys who take their job seriously. https://t.co/3WRCPkTqBT
@GrahamBarfield I'm definitely buying positive regression for Wilson - concern for rme is the rushing and the volume. Where do they compare on volume?
ICYMI: MY Week 9 ranks are posted: https://t.co/0FIoV5uQyJ
Good stuff from the smart guys @FantasyLabs https://t.co/ZxwDbpGyEZ
If the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù is correct, LeVeon won‚Äôt report today.... https://t.co/Y9qCEGMg05
@Michael_Fabiano I‚Äôm going to ignore this and I‚Äôm going to delete all my tweets about this. I believe in everything I‚Äôve said to you but it‚Äôs clear we don‚Äôt agree here and that‚Äôs not gonna change. I also don‚Äôt believe this serves or will serve the larger fantasy audience in any way shape or form.
@StephenQLane Exactly.
@NoiseGateStudio Thank you.
@DanielDopp @FFHitman Agree with Daniel here, obviously.

It's not me - the @FantasyLifeApp team deserves all the credit - glad you're enjoying! https://t.co/n0wZY5pdkM
@ShaskoSante I assume very soon. There was a delay because of the trade deadline
@friscojosh Ha thanks
@JCWonka We all want to win but at end of the day this is supposed to be fun. Since he called within minutes of making the mistake and it's an obvious mistake (I'm surprised Hill isn't undroppable)....I would have done the same thing. (Reversed the move &amp; given Hill back). Come on.
@JCWonka Yes.
@EatCookCryptos Ha. Normal jeans. Just looked that way because of the costume.
@JayyBiggs Sigh. Appreciate the support.
@JayyBiggs I didn't. I don't follow him. What did he do?
Every single day on #TheFantasyShow on ESPN+, we do something where I think "Well, there's no way we'll ever do something dumber than that!" And then, of course, the next show comes and says "Hold my beer." https://t.co/xOIIkpW1vP
Does LeVeon report tomorrow?
@GiantBallofOil @DraftKings I assume it's they haven't changed his team designation but Tate doesn't play this week - PHI on a bye - and DT does (HOU @ DEN)
@BrandonHerFFB @WillBrinson I'm sure I'm terrible at it but feel like doing this is low on the list of offenses
Love seeing tweets like this. @RotoGrinders is part of https://t.co/xImiAf1tzX, where you get full access to DFS tools &amp; analysis for all sports from them, @FantasyLabs @DailyRoto @RotoWire ESPN+ and a Bronze+ sub to @RotoTracker  - the best deal in DFS! https://t.co/xImiAf1tzX https://t.co/pjX1DAdbj1
@WillBrinson Very fair. I used to just RT people until I was told by a social media expert (in theory at least) that the best way to amplify / drive engagement for a tweet is to quote tweet it to YOUR audience as otherwise ppl just scroll past tweets from ppl they don‚Äôt recognize.
Yeah I don‚Äôt get why GB fans in my time line are so excited. https://t.co/cZSzVkMh2d
That‚Äôs actually kind of amazing. https://t.co/N2HlpFGRI7

@grosenstein @MikeClayNFL Co-sign!
Kinda wanted a WR but I‚Äôll take it! Nice to see the Skins as buyers at the deadline. https://t.co/T3cue72EGh
@WillBrinson I am by no means a social media expert but I have been told that, especially if you RT someone with a smaller audience, the tweet gets more engagement if you quote tweet it (a tweet from someone your audience recognizes) vs just RTing a tweet from someone they may not recognize.
Agreed - Powell could certainly get a look. Would expect TJ Jones to get most reps initially however. https://t.co/tc6PHxBpSX
No stand alone value for Montgomery but hurts Collins a bit and mostly Buck Allen. https://t.co/R5Hbbpck5X
Tate leaving DET opens up 9.7 targets per gm. Obviously helps Golladay and Marvin Jones but deeper leagues could look at T.J Jones, who has run 38 slot routes this year and I wonder if they play with Riddick there with Kerryon‚Äôs emergence? Theo‚Äôs run 10 routes from slot this yr. https://t.co/Q1x6spnobQ
Some quick thoughts on the Golden Tate trade .... https://t.co/iKhg1pZptw
Also - from a divisional opponent / Redskins fan / we are 5-2 but need some WR help POV... this is very disappointing. https://t.co/zIFXXBLkzy
If you don‚Äôt stash him last week, Courtland Sutton becomes the obvious #1 pickup at WR this week. https://t.co/83ygVviOpA
Wow. Tate now on a bye this week - so 2 bye weeks for those that have Tate - deep dive on all trades coming up on The Fantasy Show on ESPN+. (I‚Äôm currently on set now) https://t.co/C7Z6sID9RD

@billbarnwell Great line
And now, a message to those with Todd Gurley on their roster from #TheFantasyShow on ESPN+ https://t.co/1tP7PlsqL1
I‚Äôm starting Gordon and hoping for the best. Three quarters of Gordon vs BUF, even with a shadow by White, is better than any other option that is potentially out there. https://t.co/x3BeIdZUfu
@Stringmellow Golladay is currently available in 11% of ESPN leagues (10 teamers) and my guess is after his recent struggles and 6 teams on a bye there will be some impatient teams.
ICYMI: Today‚Äôs pod recapping all of Week 8‚Äôs Action: https://t.co/OBtY2sIyAP
Golden Tate for a 3 or a 4? Many team should do that ASAP. Also don‚Äôt drop Golladay! https://t.co/YIHsYNF3uR
Over Winston's 1st 2 starts, he was the 3rd best QB in FF avg 25.4 points per game. In his brutal Cincy game, he still threw 276 yards, a TD and almost has a 2nd but Humphries was down on the six inch line. Good fantasy QB's are often different than good NFL QB's. https://t.co/IsEniDXbFk
https://t.co/VvZxhrY87U
Also, never ideal to have multiple QB's on the roster, especially in a big 6 team bye week, but if you can afford to hold Winston, I would. I don't believe we have seen the last of him as a starter this year. https://t.co/A57fnz6nDt
The Tampa Bay QB's average 26 fantasy points per game this year. Only Patrick Mahomes has been better on a per game basis this year. My guess is a short leash and certainly risk involved but FitzMagic should be a popular pick-up this week. https://t.co/k3EQybpUa9
Things are fine. Everything is fine. https://t.co/kq5jWpzvQ2
You know who has championship experience as a head coach, lives in Cleveland and is available? Ty Lue.
We are live now recapping Week 8 https://t.co/THZvU5OLxz
Gonna see a lot of these. Hard to complain about what Gurley got you but still.... losing by .4 - that‚Äôs a tough one.  #FantasyLife https://t.co/ORszqSMioj
Also - line closed at Rams -7.5.... https://t.co/5gh8DozGYg
Wow wow wow. Shades of Brian Westbrook.... Todd Gurley refuses to go in for a score so Rams can keep ball and not let Rodgers get another shot. Massive fantasy swing / implications. Crazy.
After Morris-Gate I‚Äôm as anti-Kyle as you get but this is an insane take. No he is not. And nor should he be. https://t.co/7wTM1zBKeB
FREE AARON JONES!!!!!!
I have no thoughts on players that are dead to me. Who is this player you are discussing? Is he in the league? What position does he play? https://t.co/p9yf3o5BpI
@MikeClayNFL @SigmundBloom Jets are a mess.
@kevsez68 Yeah he tweeted it to 12 people
The week after everyone starts Josh Reynolds... now he goes off. #ofcourse
And he converts the 2 pt conversion to Godwin. Tie game in Cincy, 1 min to play https://t.co/x9pR5tpdMm
Fitzmagic happening in Cincy. TD to OJ Howard. 1:05 left.
Patrick Mahomes over 300 passing yards for a 7th straight game. Forget a streak, no QB had more than 6 300-yard passing games ALL OF LAST SEASON. #rockstar
This is the Hunt TD I mentioned earlier. https://t.co/6VTukdykXF
That‚Äôs not good https://t.co/AATkRDJiXN
Mike Evans with a 72-yard score. His first since Week 3 ... you know, back when FitzMagic was calling the shots https://t.co/gbQvtTGPxM
Cam Newton‚Äôs now has 21 career games with multiple TD passes AND a rush TD. More than twice as many as anyone else has had over that stretch.
Winston was QB10 last week, so... you‚Äôre welcome. And this week, against the 31st ranked pass D and 28th scoring D the last four weeks I stand by the call. He played poorly. It happens. They‚Äôre human. https://t.co/Oq4YH5BuSu
And mercifully Winston is pulled after interception number 4, this time a pick 6. Fitzmagic in for some garbage time.
He‚Äôs been brutal today. https://t.co/pwo63H6SnP
Kareem Hunt has 10 scores this season. And it feels like he‚Äôs still. not being talked about enough. The Golden State Chiefs are in full effect. https://t.co/kHirQBn34L
Meanwhile fantasy heartbreak as a Winston TD pass to Humphries is overturned and rules down at the one and Peyton Barber gets in. Argh
Kareem Hunt with one of the all time great touchdowns. Wait till you see it. Ridiculous.
Antonio Brown now has 16 regular season games with multiple TD catches in his career. That ties Gronk for the most such games over that stretch.
@FieldYates Yes. Officially ruled dead to me.
Mack and Doyle are ACTIVE
TD or a 40 yard reception in 5 straight games for Courtland Sutton. Definitely looks the part....
Now 3 straight games with 3+ TD passes ... 1 of 4 QBs that have done that this season. https://t.co/TSqXyn8EV3
Mixon now goes over 18 points for the 3rd time in 4 weeks.
So not exactly how you draw it up in the playbook, CMC makes a great play and Cam now has 6 straight multi-TD pass games. CMC now has twice as many TDs today as he had entering play.
Travis Kelce with a TD or 95 receiving yards in 6 of his last 7 games. First TD reception since Week 4 ... also against these Broncos.
Greg Olsen has now scored in consecutive games. Ran a route on over 78% of Newton dropbacks during the previous 2 games.
Slow starting Russell Wilson appears to be behind us. 7/7 with 86 yards and 2 TDs. 3 TD passes in both games prior to the bye.
Tyler Lockett has now scored in 6 of 7 games this season. Has already matched a career high in TD receptions ... we are in Week 8.
Adrian Peterson with his first TD reception since September 8 ... 2013. The Breaking Bad finale had yet to air at that point. It‚Äôs been a minute, as the kids say, but very happy to see it #HTTR
Last 3 games + less than a quarter today for Tarik Cohen as a pass catcher: 23 catches for 350 yards and 3 scores ... Has scored in 4 straight games overall
Hasn‚Äôt always been pretty, but Alex Collins now has 6 scores this season.
3 straight games with a 40+ yard catch for Emmanuel Sanders (tied for the 2nd longest streak this season). Sets up a Phillip Lindsay TD, his second in as many weeks.
@scott_pianowski @friscojosh Scott
Agree with John here. I'm nervous about my Skins here https://t.co/hgajvkd7oB
Allen Robinson and Robby Anderson OUT.... Taylor Gabriel, Anthony Miller and Jermaine Kearse with improved fantasy outlooks. Gabriel a top 20 ish play today

Your call -   Phillip Lindsay feels like a top-10 play today. He's got a great matchup vs. the Chiefs and most importantly, I'm playing against him in the War Room League, so you KNOW he‚Äôs going off. https://t.co/k0oPCjfFUN

@MikeClayNFL Why didn't you project Marvin Hall over Julio?
Touchdown, Not Julio!
@FieldYates Dad used to tell tales of it when he put me to bed, but I always thought it was made up
Here‚Äôs some thoughts on Amari Cooper. Not mentioned in this clip is that Dak Prescott, QB4 over the last two weeks &amp; available in 70% of ESPN leagues, gets a nice boost from Cooper being there and being able to stretch the field. https://t.co/ifLcnVooeN

@jasonrmcintyre Should be serious junk time in second half. Gotta hope for that at this point
The Browns have really gotten jobbed by the refs continually this year. https://t.co/TLkmA5TM3A
@LateRoundQB Yeah but I bet you didn‚Äôt know Marthew Stafford and Clayton Kershaw grew up together.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Andy Dalton used to look at Tyler Boyd
I am not proud of that win but damn will I take it!!!! #HTTR
Why would you not slide in bounds Alex????
Wow. Justin Tucker misses his first extra point EVER. After Ravens go down and score with a Flacco to John Brown TD pass with 24 seconds left. 24-23 Saints
No, they actually don‚Äôt. Feel for Chargers fans too but this isn‚Äôt close. Browns fans have had it worse for longer than any other fan base. https://t.co/elgQJoYcxJ
I feel so so terrible for Browns fans.  Every time you think they‚Äôve found every way to lose, they come up with a new way. https://t.co/118NJNHXzs
Oh sure... NOW Kapri. Ibbs does something. But I‚Äôll take it. Skins into the end zone first.
Starting with last postseason, James White now has 11 TDs in his last 10 games.
A pair of rushing TDs for Latavius Murray should soften the blow for those who drafted Dalvin Cook but handcuffed him with Murray. Since 2015, only Todd Gurley has more rush TDs.
For the first time as a pro, Brock Osweiler has thrown multiple TD passes in consecutive games. You can‚Äôt stop him, you can only hope to contain him. #HappyBrocktober
Consecutive games now with 5+ catches and a TD reception for Devin Funchess. The second time he has done so in his career.
TY Hilton had 4 touchdown catches last season on 108 targets. He has 4 this season on 42 targets.
On a day full of surprises, there may be nothing more surprising than the Bucs have 3 rushing touchdowns and no passing scores through 3. DJax, Winston and Ronald Jones have all run it in.
Michael Roberts now has 4 catches this season. 3 of them are. touchdowns. #efficient #wheresgolladay
3 straight games now with a 25+ yard rush for Trubisky. Making him only the second QB over the last decade to do that.
And the Cody Kessler era is underway in Jacksonville. Bortles is pulled from the game.
Actually tied with the Titans after today. https://t.co/WMK83GNA3d
James White with a TD reception for the 4th time in his last 5 games and 5th of the season. He has more TD receptions this season than the Titans or Bills have as a team
Oh yeah. Working his way into the Triangle of Trust. https://t.co/wBfU5uceY0
Can only guard for so long. Andrew Luck buys time and finds TY for a score. Hilton with a TD or 115 yards in 4 of 5 games this season.
Weeks 3-6, Lamar Miller was NOT one of 49 players with a 50-rushing yard game and NOT one of 52 players with a rushing TD. He‚Äôs done both today. Against a defense we think is good. #OfCourse #wth
34.2% of Luck‚Äôs career TD passes have gone to the TE. Erik Swoope aka NOT Eric Ebron - catches the most recent one.
Alshon Jeffery with 12 TD receptions and counting in his 17 games with Carson Wentz.
Oh man.... Sony Michel needing help to walk off the field. Looked bad.
DeAndre Hopkins is really really good at the football. #analysis. #onehandedcatch
Julian Edelman with a TD reception in consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 8-9 of 2015
Adam Thielen scores for a 4th straight game. On his way to joining a select crew of players with 100+ rec. yards and a TD reception in 4 straight. Only Beckham (twice), Josh Gordon and Calvin Johnson have done that over the past decade. #stud
@FieldYates @sagesteele @Ravens @Redskins Agree with Field. Tough matchup but Brees is the play. Redskins allow 7th fewest rush yards to opposing QB's.... Lots of Dak's value is from his legs
Wow. That is a helluva play by Mariota
Wind is expected to be a big factor in CAR-PHI and MIN-NYJ. You're downgrading the passing offense a little and I'd be wary of playing a kicker in those games.....
Dwayne Allen... a desperate TE nation turns it's eyes to you. #howluckydoyoufeel? https://t.co/iPe0ugInfH
The @FantasyLifeApp continues to crush with alerts, last minute advice, chats &amp; so much more.  Love getting all these tweets. https://t.co/mSmKsZmCz8
On #FFNow Sal Pal reporting from Philly they are expecting winds up to 25-30 mph. Downgrade to the passing offenses... Sal Pal expects a lot of Corey Clement out of the backfield today.
#FFNOW at 10am ET on ESPN2... come join us. @MollyQerim @Stephania_ESPN @FieldYates @tthasselbeck
Gronk officially OUT. Best TE's available in more that 50% of ESPN leagues for today only (&amp; their ESPN projection in PPR):  Uzomah (8), Watson (7), Clay (7), Everett (6)... I also have a gut feeling about V Davis w/ so many WSH pass catchers banged up https://t.co/7dXkC9Yn4C
Austin Ekeler now my RB10 this week. Ranks will update on the site soon. But get Gordon out of your lineup. https://t.co/Hd39Lf643C
Gutty win. Well done @CuseFootball https://t.co/4CIUm5u874
Ruh-roh. Stay tuned and make sure you have a back-up plan... https://t.co/PyQMSf3Oq3
@FieldYates Stupid. One STUPID point.
Well that‚Äôs not good. As @Stephania_ESPN always reminds us - never a good sign when the designation moves in the wrong direction as the week progresses. It‚Äôs a 9:30am ET game (London) so make sure you‚Äôre up to swap in Ekeler or someone else. Ekeler would be top 20 if MG can‚Äôt go. https://t.co/TIMvLNuP8V
Someone send me a screenshot of this actually being on air. So great. We have the best fans.... #06010 https://t.co/4WLo4IdThs
Two moves, same person, around 10am Friday morning. Carried them all season till now. Ouch. #FantasyLife https://t.co/P9sUvGMnrq
Exactly https://t.co/uUDTNw0jOh
Would be tough to trust Hyde this weekend however. Can‚Äôt imagine him getting significant work a day after joining the team. Yeldon still the guy you want Sunday among JAX RB.
Finally, Wks 14-16, CLE plays CAR, DEN, CIN. All of whom rank bottom 10 in YPC against. Nick Chubb could be a real factor during fantasy playoffs. His value obviously skyrockets with this trade. RB2. And Duke Johnson should see an uptick close to last yr usage. https://t.co/Xz3BBmHfV1
Also, per @KyleSoppeESPN From Week 12-15, JAX plays 3 games against opponents that rank bottom 10 in terms of goal-to-go defensive efficiency https://t.co/kG18C8hwhc
Hyde‚Äôs ROS value rests on when/if Fournette returns. Once he is back, obviously hurts significantly. But if he is out a while? From Week 12-16, JAX plays 4 games against teams that rank 16th or worse vs fantasy RB‚Äôs. https://t.co/aEFdo3DoH5
More Hyde: have to assume JAX is worried @ Fournette &amp; want to get back to what worked last season: They led NFL with a 45.8% rush rate. Hyde is coming from a team that, under Baker Mayfield, ranks 5th in pass attempts since he became the starter. Hyde is a RB1 until LF returns
Chubb https://t.co/1Ps00chgBh
I get a ton of these after every major news story. Keep crushing @FantasyLifeApp https://t.co/b1qPrGXPeA
If you didn‚Äôt get Nick Chubb it‚Äôs because someone else in your league has @FantasyLifeApp ... their alerts are second to none. https://t.co/7zqegPeCVu
Carlos Hyde jumps from the 28th offensive line in terms of yards per carry BEFORE first contact to the 9th. Hyde currently ranks 43rd of 46 RBs in the metric. If he is even just average there and everything else remains the same, he adds 1.03 yards to his YPC average.
Whoa. Nick Chubb is available in about 80% of ESPN leagues. Huge uptick in value for him and Duke Johnson also gets a lift. Would grab Chubb ASAP https://t.co/bxOjvGCvJV
Martin could be a useable RB3 while Lynch is out though I actually prefer Jalen Richard in PPR. Raiders will down and throwing more often than not. Both are widely available in ESPN leagues. https://t.co/ellUOvBY7h
@LopeWill421 We‚Äôve definitely talked about it
Already officially ruled OUT for Week 7: Jack Doyle, Ryan Grant, Dalvin Cook, Jamison Crowder, Leonard Fournette.
@PaTiSpHaT12 Many, many people do, yes. They even pay for it.
@ScottFish24 Happy Birthday!
Things are going well over on The Fantasy Show on ESPN+. https://t.co/nRCjQfzGmA
Tough year for Cook continues. Latavius Murray a viable RB2 at the Jets. https://t.co/Hnx6fzvWpT
ICYMI: #LoveHate for Week 7 is now posted. Now with the correct link! https://t.co/J45MRHcxsN
@Rob_Dibble Crap. You‚Äôre right. Sent the wrong link. Thanks.
Yeah that‚Äôs not gonna look good on the resume. Nowhere to go but up for David Johnson, Fitz, Kirk, Rosen. https://t.co/j2BXlD4RJa
Well done https://t.co/WtXJl98Fsx
Hopefully it‚Äôs nothing but heads up. Every person with Melvin hopefully already has Austin Ekeler rostered. https://t.co/thUx2k8C1w

Depends on the size of the league but in a vacuum? No. What in the last five weeks gave you any confidence in this passing offense? https://t.co/jMRcEySrx6
And with that score, Larry Fitzgerald puts points on the board for the fantasy benches of America. #ofcourse
Worth your time in keeper leagues? Peyton Manning gives you insight into everything you need to know about Josh Rosen here. Full episode is on ESPN+. https://t.co/S3r0Fhmnao https://t.co/rVGafo0clq

@PFTCommenter Shooting the sketch was much fun. Never have I stared straight ahead without moving my head for so long.
ü§£ https://t.co/1oSerFXm4f
@nykwins @FantasyLifeApp interesting idea, @YouFoundYasin
@adamzavala @Moonwalker619 You're probably right. Be well and good luck in Week 7!
@Moonwalker619 @adamzavala Getting a lot of "why did you start Morris when you had CMC/Michel/White questions." Wasn't clear on format in the rant ... I was too budsy frothing at the mouth, ha
For those asking, it's a 12 team super flex league with 22 man rosters. Can start up to six RB.
@mattbarrows @ChrisBiderman Why do you say that, Matt?
@jay_price15 Email Support at RotoPass dot com and they will get you set. Thanks
@charlie092474 @cpumplun I didn‚Äôt want trades because it was all strangers - worries about possibly colluding to beat the Vampire. Tempted to do the free agent thing. Vampire gets waivers but once they run it‚Äôs a free for all. Gonna see how season plays out first. It‚Äôs fun and competitive.
Ahem. I have some thoughts on this. https://t.co/qHk3CKHM2B
Been a minute. My bad. You are correct! https://t.co/TBdXDRM7gN
Hahaha love seeing stuff like this. @FantasyLifeApp team crush with alerts. https://t.co/XZrvwKoG3O
Brock around the Brock. Brockin‚Äô in the USA. Stop, Brock &amp; Roll. Brock-a-doodle-do. Brock and loaded. Brock it to me. Sitting by the Brock of the Bay. Brock, Stock and Barrel. I just brocked a guy on Twitter. This is when we Brockets. Building Brocks. It‚Äôs another week of puns! https://t.co/owE483ZM8U
I don't think so but I'll look into that. My Vampire teams went 2-0 this week. One team tried... I stole Julio away from them for Sterling Shepard. Another team purposefully tanked, so I took Gostkowski away from them - the only player they started that had any value. https://t.co/QtLWStlr5L
Awesome news. Hearing Peyton break down NFL games in Detail - the way @kobebryant does for hoops - will be very very cool. Pumped. https://t.co/3EV5LZFkro
@ChicagoKnow 12 team super flex league w/no kickers, no D/ST and 22 roster spots. Fairly deep league where you can play up to 6 RB in a starting line-up.
It‚Äôs a ranking Wednesday on the @fantasyfocus podcast. You can find all the ranks on https://t.co/B59CVviUvd, but swing by the @fantasyfocus podcast for the live discussion.  https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
@_CrazyPaul @HowTheProsDo @FantasyLabs @DailyRoto @RotoGrinders @RotoWire @RotoTracker Well, considering Labs is $70/month, DailyRoto $60/month and RG is $40 a month, I'd say getting just those 3 alone is worth $119 a month. But you are correct - it is for a serious DFS player.
@lakergreat1 @FantasyLabs @DailyRoto @RotoGrinders @RotoWire @RotoTracker Everything except at RotoTracker - that's a bronze plus sub. But yes, at every other site you get everything
@Skip1_4 Article says Mostert will be behind Morris and they would only turn to him if Brieda can't go.
Not mentioned in this video... every beat writer that covers the team every day in practice had no idea about Mostert's usage... and Brieda was listed as DOUBTFUL all week.
@FieldYates I just keyed your car
Before you make your waiver claim tonight... some thoughts on Ito Smith https://t.co/ez81pOe566
@amber_kevin Damn that's cold. And sadly correct
@ScottFish24 not your fault my friend!
Just in time for the start of NBA, I'm thrilled to announce the launch of https://t.co/xImiAf1tzX - full access to great multi sport DFS sites like @FantasyLabs @DailyRoto @RotoGrinders @RotoWire...plus ESPN+ &amp; bronze+on @RotoTracker. Code: LAUNCH gets you 15% off!
@ScottFish24 Olsen and Doyle in that league. Wentz. LeVeon. Conner went in the 14th when ADP for that league had him in the 19th. Slowest draft EVER. It‚Äôs....been a long year in that league.
@CPatrickNFL Ha. If we weren‚Äôt live on Twitter I would have cursed like a sailor.
@friscojosh @FieldYates Ha. Thanks Josh
@The_Mooch_ Yeah. Was planning on it. Draft was in mid July for this league. ADP in this league type had him going in 19th round then. (Its a 22 round league). He was drafted in the 14th round in that league just before I was to take him.
Deep 12 team 2 QB league with 4 super flex positions. That team is still waiting for LeVeon so my RB I started were CMC, Sony, James White, Lynch, and Morris. https://t.co/WbpCvaMcUo
I've played fantasy football for over 30 years. Last night, I had my worst loss ever. https://t.co/gNkcptCrHa
Today‚Äôs 06010 pod! Waiver wire pickups, MNF reax, injury updates, Week 7 projections and I, ahem, have some thoughts on the 49ers RB usage last night. https://t.co/0zVe4g94dS
After we recap MNF on the @fantasyfocus podcast, we are taking a look at some tough spots for fantasy managers (PIT RBs, IND TEs, OBJ and Gronk) and ranking the Week 7 waiver wire finds - we are live now https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
@NAAndrews Wow. Congrats.
Meanwhile, not since his father has a head coach screwed fantasy players with running back usage in a game. #shanahanagins
Mama there goes that bad bad man
Good lord
Aaron Rodgers vs the entire 49ers.
@MichaelHustad @jkranzley @MarcusHumpsAndy We‚Äôve never met. I get 1000 of tweets a day. How is a tweet that says ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù clearly all in good fun? There‚Äôs so much vitriol &amp; anger on social media, what is the joke in spreading hate? And before you mention my column name, I am clear it‚Äôs about the matchup not the person
Brutal. https://t.co/Jsr3sEI8lW
Ha thanks. His lack of usage is shocking and even people who cover the team every day have been taken by surprise with Mostert‚Äôs usage. But I‚Äôm also owning the call. If I celebrate the good gotta own the bad. https://t.co/0cBtSKY7Tv
Duly noted. https://t.co/7uD6y3myVM
An Alfred Morris appearance. Gets the first down but of course there‚Äôs a penalty so still no points at all.
Even people who cover the team every day are surprised by Morris lack of usage. https://t.co/xfNn12spLb
FML https://t.co/izNqaVLhog
And there you have it. As someone who literally needs 1 point from Morris tonight to win this is very depressing. https://t.co/XF7tBYLsVj
Mentioned in my #LoveHate this week that coming into Week 6 CJ Beathard had 101 drop backs over the past 2 weeks (5th most)... and in that time he was QB14 ‚Äì more fantasy points than Brees, Ben, Dalton, Stafford...This is a fantasy friendly offense that will have to throw a ton.
@FieldYates Yep. Reading that to you was a moment I‚Äôll always treasure.
Remember the kids story ‚ÄúTortoise and the Hare‚Äù? Just mentioning in case anyone is looking for a nickname for the Packers RB rotation.
THAT... is disappointing. https://t.co/nbtE9ZRMsG
I don‚Äôt write the player notes but yeah, when that was taped Fri morning I didn‚Äôt think Brieda was playing. This morning he was still ‚Äúgame time.‚Äù Given what I heard about his injury I‚Äôm very surprised at the work he‚Äôs getting &amp; how good he looks. Bad call on my part. I‚Äôll own it https://t.co/8VmN2mzDDS
#FreeAaronJones
I‚Äôm starting Morris. Brieda is the better back of course but given he was a game time decision I am expecting limited snaps. Especially if game gets out of hand. https://t.co/GgcVCikafG
I hate that Twitter has no edit button. As usual @AdamSchefter is dead on. All 3 officially active tonight. https://t.co/Bo2D4aU1fS
Last 3 seasons the Patriots lead the NFL in rushes from inside an opponents 10 yard line. https://t.co/Pw52DhsnIT
@realharrymonk What are you talking about?
@sflcomm Smart. He should have backed his guy up.
Adams will eat and I expect a nice game from Graham as well https://t.co/vk2Bh05Scg
@JonSmoker Bad take then, bad take now.
Blinking eyes guy gif. Like, a million times in a row. https://t.co/hcgCDlpRN6
@ScottFish24 It is disappointing that so few can ruin something for so many, but my best advice to not bother reading the comments and take full advantage of your filters. And yeah, mute button is your friend. I find the less I engage the more I enjoy.
Today‚Äôs pod! Week 6 recap pod is now posted: https://t.co/AAm54OTBem
@Jonbads @JoePequenoTV Yeah, then Bell should be yours
@JoePequenoTV @Jonbads Would have to know why he was released and when he let commish know it was a mistake. If it didn't happen within a few minutes of dropping him than he should be yours. Not knowing he was coming back soon is not a good enough reason.
What Stephania said. Very well deserved congratulations, @brendanroberts. Brendan edited a lot of Love/Hate's back in the day when a version of it ran on Sporting News.... Was proud to call him a colleague for many years at ESPN as well. Great writer and editor, better person. https://t.co/3mdt5KA9Pj
Breaking down all of the Week 6 action and spinning it forward. What is real and what can you believe?  Discussing it LIVE now on the @fantasyfocus podcast. https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
Ooofa. #FantasyLife https://t.co/0qhl1yYJOT
@chrizmillr I am sure you and @philiplord did. Brutal loss. Congrats to you both.
You know what's awesome? When a game lives up to - and then exceeds - the crazy hype.
They finally get a deep one to work and of course it's Hogan.  #arghhhh
Really really needed that. Ugh. https://t.co/GG3sOncRxp
Playing a team that had Saquon on TNF. Clawed my way back. And now, coming into tonight we were tied. I have Gronk left. They only have Butker left. Off to a bad start. #sigh #fantasylife
Yes, given their talent level and previous production and the Dolphins low volume offensive production to date plus a back-up QB... I stand by the call. Didn‚Äôt work out but would do it again. But feel free to coach your fake football team by yourself. I won‚Äôt take it personally. https://t.co/opusaDlYXD
Cooper Kupp is our there to start the second half. #mylittlecooperkupp #ironman #indestructible
Chad Kelly now in at QB for Denver....
Noooooooooooooooooo https://t.co/nBr5SXLu6A
After what we saw last Monday night... that‚Äôs a helluva win, @Redskins #HTTR
Cam Newton matches a career-high with his fourth straight multi pass TD game. This game is taking years off my life.
Remember Melvin Gordon‚Äôs 217-touch 0-TD rookie season? Lol. 2nd game this year with 3 scores.
Adam Thielen now with a 3rd straight game of 110 yards and a TD. The only WRs with a longer such streak over the past decade: OBJ, Josh Gordon and Calvin Johnson....
My Little Cooper Kupp and Brandin Cooks - both officially active.
Tyrell with a 29-yard TD. He is one of five players with multiple 29+ yard TD receptions in the same game this season https://t.co/eCeiHspqhc
22 TD passes since the beginning of last season for Jameis Winston ... 13 of them have gone to the TE position.
Another score for Tyler Boyd. Up to 17.5 points today. The 4th time in his last 5 that he has reached that number. #fantasyrockstar
Devin Funchess has the catch of the day so far. And at least 14.5 points in 3 of his past 4 games
Entering today, Jordy Nelson was the only player with multiple 44+ yard catches in a game. Tyrell Williams does it on consecutive plays.
First 6 regular season games for James Conner (two first names!) this season: 6 TDs. Le‚ÄôVeon Bell‚Äôs last 6 regular season games: 6 TDs.
Now three straight games with a TD for Ito Smith.
Every other game for Alex Smith. 2 TD passes in his first game. Then 0. Then 2. Then 0 (trust me, I was there). 2 first quarter TD passes today.
TD or 100 yards in 4 of his last 5 games for Tyler Boyd.
Less Sanu? NO - I want MO Sanu. Sanu was one of six WRs with at least 15.5 points in each of previous 3 weeks. 35-yard TD puts him on track for a 4th straight. #06010 #lovelist
#FantasyHeartbreak as Chris Carson scores a rushing touchdown. But... false start and called back. Two plays later Russell Wilson throws a pass to Jaron Brown. Related: I have Carson in many leagues and am playing against Wilson. #bitterberry
Cameron Brate with a score. Targeted in just 12.3% of routes with FitzMagic this season. That number rose 20% with Winston in his debut this season (22.1% last season).
With Dalvin Cook OUT I have Latavius Murray as RB16 vs a AZ team that has allowed 9 RB TD's this year and is 31st vs the run. The rest of my updated ranks post inactives: https://t.co/otjlOoon9F
As everyone who has @FantasyLifeApp is well aware this morning, the app CRUSHES it on alerts. Such a great community - easy to get quality feedback on your team. The team there is killing it - love seeing tweets like this! https://t.co/O82oaLsEv9
As expected. I have Kapri Bibbs as a RB3 (RB28) - flex play with PPR upside. https://t.co/tGMPxwOEBE
Dalvin Cook is OUT.
BROCKTOBER IS UPON US. (I want no Dolphin today. None). https://t.co/dhXfitPN7G
With Le'Veon Bell's return imminent, James Conner's value is in question.  How should you approach it moving forward? https://t.co/tq3vcW94V8
@mikedatiger Chester Rogers avail?
LOTS of huge injuries we are tracking... bad weather in DEN....Should you start Josh Gordon and every ther question you have will be answered. FANTASY FOOTBALL NOW starts 10am ET on ESPN2. #FFNow
Bears D/ST suddenly on 100% of rosters on DFS sites.... https://t.co/KjiRKcKgnt
@AlZeidenfeld I feel like he can, especially as he got "older" - his scars and injuries took longer to heal - like in Logan - so figure he can't be drunk for a long time, but can definitely get there. Especially if he does, like, a ton of shots.
@katienolan Kapri, assuming it's PPR. Ito will need a TD to pay off. Which is certainly possible but Bibbs should have value in PPR regardless of TD. CAR struggles vs pass catching RB
LeVeon sits again https://t.co/wPVZisKkiT
@AlZeidenfeld The healing helps with the hangover
@DFSbrew Correct. He‚Äôll be a popular play.
@Flyest826 No
Was worried that might happen. This is why I was advocating Kapri Bibbs earlier in the week as a stash. He has some solid PPR appeal in a good match-up with CAR. https://t.co/43OK7Zy9Rg
Just got this alert from @FantasyLifeApp ... the fastest alerts in the industry. Great matchup but if they‚Äôre talking pitch count IF he‚Äôs active? Risk reward RB2. How lucky do you feel? https://t.co/s8w6eAwAEg
You believe or you do not believe.  I‚Äôm in. https://t.co/4r5Oa2c6Ro
Last yr in Week 12, a home game vs TB without Freeman active: Tevin Coleman had 19 carries for 97 yards and 2 TD. Avg 13.3 PPG for his career when getting 15+ touches. TB owns the least efficient defense in both the red zone and goal-to-go situations this season.

The only weather I significantly downgrade players for is severe wind or crazy blizzard like conditions. I can't imagine not starting Cooks or Cupp if they're active https://t.co/zFbEnBvvOf
Bilal Powell would be a strong RB2 if Crow misses the game https://t.co/diIWM5iI3o
As in that he exists? https://t.co/7kgNXJfmNB
Giddy up https://t.co/cALdr9SADF
@joe_sheehan @billbarnwell @robertmays https://t.co/YFidDUYtzG
Heads up Louisiana! https://t.co/HkrXtSDCQ6
Tweeted this earlier this week. With Chris Thompson &amp; Adrian Peterson both now listed as questionable and as game time decisions seems like there‚Äôs an even better chance Bibbs gets real run on Sun. If either guy is out he‚Äôs worth a flyer in deeper leagues and DFS tourneys https://t.co/RtTXLo5doP
@robertmays @billbarnwell Well it‚Äôs better than 0.7 so you know, maybe give Eli some time. Amirite?
@FieldYates Yep, had to start saving for your college.
@SanguineBlaze @fantasyfocus @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @DanielDopp
And Paul Richardson is banged up too. So basically, every Redskins offensive weapon is hurt except.... Jordan Reed. https://t.co/UTmn0uMl7v
Still prefer Brate this week even if Howard plays - figure limited snaps for Howard and based on 2017 (all we really have to go on) Winston has more of a connection with Brate than Howard. https://t.co/SYpF4vgFtl
@FieldYates I hate you
Two good offenses, two bad defenses. Fantasy goodness. https://t.co/q3dkJZeJx1
Tevin Coleman becomes a top 15 play this week and Ito Smith on the flex radar. Updated rankings as soon as we have the practice reports. https://t.co/xenWGySsMw
Still think Hines is the INDY RB you‚Äôll want to start this week but very interested to see how Mack looks and how they use him. Good stash if you have the room. Marlon Mack available in 75% of ESPN leagues. https://t.co/4ONVlXzTBG
@OneMoreRoundFF @NFLfantasy @adamrank @bryan_rubin
@RyanMc23 @TomDegenerate I‚Äôm in too many leagues as is but I could possibly be talked into it
@thegreenzamboni I often mention wrong calls, especially on the podcast &amp; I've certainly referenced them on twitter as well. The Enunwa miss is specifically referenced in this week's Love/Hate. But feels like you should unfollow. Many great fantasy analysts out there that will suit your needs. GL
Continuing our Week 6 preview LIVE on the @fantasyfocus podcast with @FieldYates and @Stephania_ESPN. You‚Äôve got lineup calls to make and we are here to help! https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
@YusefGaiter Also good.
Well that was fun, @MattBowen41. Good times. #sigh #whatareyougonnado? https://t.co/X6IjczOTKM
@joey_kalchuk Yep. Stand by that.
@KyleLeith Ha. I‚Äôm not claiming I was the only one high on him. Many were. But it definitely was not universal. And I got questioned by a lot of fans on it. The hammy also hurt his preseason ADP a little.
@KyleLeith Touts
@KyleLeith I don‚Äôt play high stakes. But there were definitely some tours that had him in the 9-11 range of RB and as a back end RB1 or high end RB2, arguing the rookie  angle
Sexy Field Yates https://t.co/xroGYm8S63
Early this year I wrote about Travis Anderson  @tma2112 - the 37 year old FF Commish who is a Dad of 3 &amp; has recently been diagnosed with brain cancer. Many of you were touched by his story &amp; asked how you can help-his family has set up a go fund me. https://t.co/6D5jDbn8aD
@thegreenzamboni You mean I loved a guy w/ a massive target share who came within six inches of a long TD and only b/c Chris Harris held him didn‚Äôt get anything? Yes. I remember that. Stand by that call. Darnold threw 3 scores in that game. Odds he wouldn‚Äôt have 1 of them given his target share?
100%. @LRiddickESPN put his money where his mouth is too. He took him first overall in the ESPN ‚ÄúWar Room‚Äù league. https://t.co/YJ5gVrpUSH
@bengalblaine Many folks had him lower
Remember when people were asking why I had a rookie RB behind a bad offensive line as a top 6 overall pick? Lol.
Great work by @Stephania_ESPN on getting exclusive access. What goes on in the tent? https://t.co/ATcCLKD0uC

Totally get why but really sorry to see you go, @ESPNKenD ... you did great work for us and you will be missed. You always have a home with me. Much respect. https://t.co/9mYhSQIoO5
BTW - here's a super deep sleeper this week, especially for DFS if some combo of Richardson/Crowder/Doctson can't go.... Harris should get some decent run this week https://t.co/IhKZHr8zuu
@Cleatus2121 Ah you had a good team - should have tried instead of "taking a knee".... see you in Week 9
FYI for those desperate types looking toward Ellison as a TE streamer. If truly desperate at TE, look at Erik Swoope in INDY. Ebron banged up and Doyle won't play https://t.co/UUZsC7J9T8
This was much fun, @TedyBruschi https://t.co/vJ6KpNGvlV
@CDCarter13 @JohnLitzler I am 100% against using the phrase.
Ha, thank you. Credit for my typo free columns goes to @KeithLipscomb https://t.co/M5jKl4FGTT
Today on #TheFantayShow on ESPN+, @TedyBruschi and I talked Patriots and whether you should start Josh Gordon this week. #triangleoftrust https://t.co/Tg2ThM7tfy
@Talent_Finder85 @Dealed_Up The 50 Facts column was one of ESPN‚Äôs most read columns every single week. Read last week‚Äôs Love/Hate column for an explanation.
@CDCarter13 Co-sign.
It‚Äôs #LoveHate day! Week 6 is now posted with some info one of one of the most interesting leagues I‚Äôve ever played in. https://t.co/w0vAhsC0tL
Today‚Äôs pod! TNF preview, is LeVeon going to be in a RBBC, injury updates, who‚Äôd you rather have rest of year questions, injury updates &amp; much more: https://t.co/NlkxpV71RQ
It‚Äôs #LOVEHATE Day. We are diving into some news or noise, breaking down TNF and then getting into Love/Hate on the @fantasyfocus podcast. Live now: https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
@DStang22 @LateRoundQB Yeah, not only did I never say that, I appeared (proudly and happily) in an episode of the show.
Highly recommened following @MBFantasyLife for fun facts, trivia, specials and more https://t.co/FtBqNgcauN
@LateRoundQB For the record I've also written this exact request many times. Fully support you. It's an ugly awful phrase in this context and the people that use it casually have clearly never experienced it or had someone in their life that has.
Deeper leagues he‚Äôs absolutely worth a flyer. Think it starts as a RBBC on a pass first team but he‚Äôll get a chance. And Clement/Smallwood no guarantee to stay healthy. Like what I‚Äôve seen so far of Adams. https://t.co/O8bkPxXjvK
With Chris Thompson and Adrian Peterson both banged up and traveling back home on a short week, I just picked up Kapri Bibbs in all my deeper leagues. Could be dead wrong but gut call that we see him in a decent size role this week.
On behalf of The Fantasy Show on ESPN+, @TedyBruschiESPN &amp; I have a public service announcement for all you defenders out there. https://t.co/WBG7zg0uiy
@canesfanjd @DanielDopp @fantasyfocus @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN Hate vetos in general and specifically in this case. Your fault for even allowing vetos. You should only veto in case of collusion. Your league members suck.
Today‚Äôs 06010 pod! Week 6 ranks, can you trust Evan Engram, Josh Gordon, PHI RB and much more this week: https://t.co/tegRG639Fl
It‚Äôs Wednesday and that means rankings talk. @FieldYates, @Stephania_ESPN and myself are discussing our value of Andy Dalton, confidence level in LeSean McCoy, belief in Sammy Watkins and much more! Check it out LIVE @fantasyfocus : https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
You want me to start where on the hoop? Yeah, I;m out. https://t.co/C559qaU6rk
@glenncolton1 Happy Birthday sir!
He‚Äôs been brutal. No way around it. https://t.co/7wpTxELyTD
This might have not been the game to come to.
@SonofWashington Sometimes?
While you‚Äôre watching the game you should DVR  @happytogether tonight at 830 on CBS. Super funny show that my brother executive produces... give it a chance.
Wow. Eagles have placed Jay Ajayi on IR. Would expect a true RBBC going forward with Clement and Smallwood seeing biggest uptick .... Wonder if Josh Adams gets a real shot.
Take what? That he had under 50 yds rushing? That despite avg over 7 yards a carry they only gave him SIX carries? That he had just 1 more total touch than Gore? He caught a 22 yard TD pass, ok great. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre hanging your hat on? His 1st gm in 5 w/more than 18 yds rec? https://t.co/BcM7qK2ETx
#FreeAaronJones https://t.co/eNKn6eD94c
No one circles the garbage time like Blake Bortles. 21-yard TD rush nearly doubles his fantasy output up to that point. #Bortling
Golladay with a TD for the 3rd time in 4 weeks. At least 74 receiving yards in 4 of 5 games this season. #Babytron cc @lateroundqb
166 rushing yards and counting for Crowell. That‚Äôs 166 more than he has last week. First player since Week 14 of 2015 to have multiple 50+ yard rushes in the same game. That player you ask? Crowell with the Browns.
Not a shock - Dalvin Cook officially OUT
Brutal turn of events for Jets. Refs miss a bad pass interference call on Harris (he grabbed Enunwa on what would have been a long TD pass - should have been ball at 1)... Darnold picked next play.
@LordBrently Gotta be. I played him in a few DFS lineups. Gotta believe Junk time is coming
Discussed on #FFNow and now updated.... Marvin Jones now has 6 TDs in 4.5 games against the Packers as a member of the Lions and counting...
Bortles is Bortling hard today. Ugh.
Mason Crosby entered today 10/11 on FGs this season. Started in 57.6% of leagues. Playing indoors. 0/3. All under 45 yards. Yikes. CC @tunasweasel
Fine, I‚Äôll do it myself! Beckham THROWS a TD pass to Barkley. Nice throw.
Sitting on the fantasy bench of America, Kenyan Drake catches a 22 yard TD pass.
Since 2016 the RB with the most TD carries of at least 50 yards is....Isaiah Crowell.
In a league where I have Stafford  and am facing Rodgers this game is going poorly. Two short vultures for Blount as Detroit goes up 14-0. #arghh
JuJu now has a 35+ yard reception or a TD in every game this season and in 9 straight overall (including the playoff game).
Tied for the lead in QB rushing touchdowns with 3 right now.... Cam Newton and... Josh Allen.
Nowhere to go but up for Kenyan Drake ... Would be great to see them commit to it. We'll see. I can't imagine starting Drake until you see it, however. https://t.co/EnVPenmK4Z
Mentioned this earlier on #FFNow but Hayden Hurst, who is active today, is a sneaky pick-up. 1st round pick of the Ravens, good pass catching TE, I know they like him a lot there... Think he has a nice role in this offense sooner than later.
If you have specific last minute questions about your line-up you can post in @FantasyLifeApp &amp; get immediate feedback from a great, smart community of fantasy football players. Also the alerts are ridiculously great. Download it now &amp; then you'll be tweeting things like this guy https://t.co/fZTyxZGCAX
Randall Cobb + Geronimo Allison are OUT - Davante Adams is IN. Expect more workload for Jimmy Graham, of course... I expect more run game work (Free Aaron Jones!), and I bet we see more work for Ty Montgomery. M Valdes-Scantling gets an opportunity as well....
.@MollyQerim says Julio is wearing a "belt bag" and it's a thing now. Thoughts? https://t.co/jbGDpeBiud
Interesting nugget from @JosinaAnderson on #FFNow... She's reporting no "pitch count" on Devonta Freeman BUT... the expectation from her sources are a 40/40/20 RB split between Freeman/Coleman/Ito Smith. Ito has carved a role out for himself these last few weeks.
Should you trade for Le'Veon Bell?   Here's what you can expect when he returns in Week 8. https://t.co/OOMERPTG8E
Just discussed Kenyan Drake on #FFNOW on ESPN2. Didn't get a chance to mention that he has lost yardage on 24.2% of carries this year (Non-Drake RBs avg 10.3%).....  LAST TWO WEEKS RUSHING:  Kenyan Drake: 8 carries for 6 yards rushing Brock Osweiler: 1 carry for 7 yards rushing
.@FieldYates will keep you looking sharp. https://t.co/6P0zyuhi0B
Yep. Could definitely see Gillislee back in NE https://t.co/nwJZ4n1z2U
Both interesting players and at least one of them is likely to go off. But  being cautious until we see it on the field. https://t.co/S1kw7RAXcc
Peterson off the injury report - not a great matchup but if you need him he‚Äôll be out there on Monday https://t.co/JaJr6ljqpw
Flex? No. Still too much risk. But he is now on the acceptable 4/5 dart throw radar for deeper leagues. But for a 10 or 12 teamed I‚Äôd want to see more production before I immediately  start him. But definitely a big opportunity for him to get more PT with Saints https://t.co/47v6gD6CF6
Better late than never. BTW - Everyone says this. ‚¨áÔ∏è. https://t.co/Xk7ZWfX2ji
@billbarnwell I remember when Gase gave that interview and so many ppl on twitter were very excited about it.... until I showed them the interview where Gase said the same thing about Ajayi getting tons of work.... a month before trading him.
@NicholasIvanoff @LisaKerney Lisa is talking DFS. I‚Äôm season long. Massive target share vs west coast team traveling east for 1pm start on short week-Harris won‚Äôt be on him whole time. Den allows 3rd highest CMP % to slot when targeted. He‚Äôs a WR3 for me-I just think he beats his ESPN projection-hence ‚Äúlove‚Äù
@MikeClayNFL I am expecting more work for Jones, yes, especially given their WR situation. I think they run more in this game than they typically do.
Congrats @tunasweasel! https://t.co/ZaKgHropzc
@sms101481 I‚Äôd take Hill
Those knees make me nervous. We‚Äôve discussed on pod before. Think it‚Äôs an issue he‚Äôs going to have to deal with all year long. https://t.co/zZZmSi5pBW

@A_Chalms2 Are you starting Drake this weekend?
Today‚Äôs pod! Who is in, who is out, who should you play, who should you not. A massive Week 5 preview pod with @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @DanielDopp https://t.co/yVgnWTD99a
Love hearing stuff like this. The team @FantasyLifeApp absolutely crush it. https://t.co/CsDgUc99Ip
I got so much grief in the preseason for having Drake as a bust. ‚ÄúBut but but Gase said he‚Äôs gonna get 25 touches a game!‚Äù https://t.co/gOUXvWJ37x
Wow https://t.co/0ZL7twPm48
Previewing all of Week 5 and getting you set to win this weekend! We are live @fantasyfocus https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
@MatthewHolder35 I‚Äôve watched a LOT of Mariota over the years. Stand by the statement. Not convinced he‚Äôs not, but definitely not convinced he is.
@BearcatNeal Ha I ranked him top 10 this week
Eric Ebron &gt; a healthy Gronk tonight and this season is everything you need to know about why this game we love drives us crazy.
A one TD plus an almost 2nd TD? The gif still stands. https://t.co/CmbMjV97oB
A two touchdown game for Erik Swope. https://t.co/hPaM6YQyHf
I‚Äôm telling you. As this offense gets rolling.... gonna be a league winner.
@SMITDAWG79 @espn I like your Twitter bio...Thanks for following me! https://t.co/LJB7Bi8cH0
@Stephania_ESPN You‚Äôre back, baby. Congrats. CC @DanielDopp
And that is what Josh Gordon can do.
@SooperBlondee It‚Äôs an obvious joke. Good lord. Blocking you for being too dumb to realize that.
I don‚Äôt know if the Colts can come back but I do know Love / Hate came back. Wait, what? It‚Äôs not dead? Not anymore. #LoveHate 2: Electric Boogaloo is here for Week 5: https://t.co/2Ng040Hqdx
Since Week 14 of 2011 No QB has more rushing TDs from the 1-yard line (or closer) than....Tom Brady
He just got two goal line carries, one of which he converted but it was called incorrectly. Whoever out there is in Jason‚Äôs league‚Äôs, please trade for Michel ASAP. He doesn‚Äôt deserve him. https://t.co/QqMcgiRSev
When your RB scores a TD but it‚Äôs called wrong and then the coach doesn‚Äôt throw a challenge flag and the QB keeps it instead. https://t.co/LWgovFN5kx
@Big_Problems_ Prefer Jones side
On The Fantasy Show on ESPN+ I spoke with Nyheim Hines in the preseason and we discussed his role in the offense. He was right and then some. And with Hilton, Mack and Doyle out tonight I like his chances as a PPR flex with upside tonight. https://t.co/KmNBiXSgGt
In honor of #NationalVodkaDay you can use promo code: MB10 for 10% off a tumbler that tells it like it is ...  https://t.co/pj9RwLccWW https://t.co/qGBXIfPmmg
With Edelman back and Gordon increasing snaps, now that we have all bailed on Chris Hogan, why do I feel like he'll have three touchdowns tonight?
@ShadowSandrock Need to ask Aunt why she wants to make that trade. If she can't adequately give a reason that she prefers Hurns to Zeke (even if you don't agree with it) gotta veto. I agree - tough to justify
@PizzaMaker18 Hahahah. Go for it.
@ArmchairQBacks Sony
It‚Äôs #LOVEHATE! Wait, what? Thought that was dead? Love Hate 2: Electric Boogaloo is now posted. https://t.co/2Ng040Hqdx

Good question. @Stephania_ESPN ? https://t.co/uYIvhdRKDH
@FF_DownUnder @FieldYates Well done
@FieldYates And 1965. Don't forget 1965.
@bombasticatol1 @Stolda4 Well we can solve that issue
@bombasticatol1 In my BOLD predictions fantasy football piece you mean? What's your point? That four weeks into the season my unlikely but within the realm of possibility bold prediction doesn't look like it will come true? Is that your point?
Please Davis Don‚Äôt Hurt ‚ÄòEm https://t.co/BcYMT8W2um
@FieldYates I thought you were taking the bus after school. Do I need to come pick you up?

@ScottBarrettDFB @strayer00 @daverichard Defense is another place to save  dollars by targeting strong matchups. Try to pair (‚Äústack‚Äù) your QB with a pass catcher or a RB with a defense if playing in a group format. Good luck - love that you are teaching kids!
Today on #TheFantasyShow on ESPN+ @JFowlerESPN joined me to talk LeVeon Bell‚Äôs Fantasy stock. Odds he could be traded still? To where? And if not what will his role be once back... How much work does Conner get? https://t.co/I4O2V9QfEs

Hey @KyleSoppeESPN when was the last left handed pass by a QB in a NFL game before that? Vick?
Damn
@ZShaath Pretty good
Another one. Unbelievable. #FantasyLife https://t.co/2z9LCZUFje
As much as I like Lindsay, I don‚Äôt get the usage on Freeman. That‚Äôs a guy that needs get a ton of work, wearing down defenses. Type that gets stronger as game goes on. By constantly rotating in and out you hurt that rhythm and lessen his impact.
THAT... is brutal. Come here friend. Let me give you a virtual hug. There there.  #FantasyLife. https://t.co/jBZOUSi3JW
Nice work @JFowlerESPN https://t.co/iMy15kfHjO

THERE‚ÄôS THE ROYCE WE‚ÄôVE BEEN WAITING FOR.
@FieldYates @B52Brewing I won‚Äôt have any of that fresh talk young man. Go to your room.
@FieldYates @B52Brewing Picture isn‚Äôt fuzzy enough.
On today‚Äôs Fantasy Show on ESPN+ we recapped Week 4, including what to make of Hogan, the Bears, Fournette‚Äôs injury status w/@Stephania_ESPN, what to do w/McCoy,Henry, Drake &amp; as shown here - what to make of Winston starting in TB. Today‚Äôs show: https://t.co/7semHxmXwe https://t.co/mkLUCwW4DH
Big difference between ‚Äúfit in‚Äù and a full blown time share. Carson when healthy is still the SEA RB you‚Äôd want. https://t.co/xxQJ1B05of
And there it is. https://t.co/LhY0jUiTfr
Winston is available in 90% of ESPN leagues. On a bye this week BUT - one of the most talented pass catching corps in the NFL, fantasy friendly offense that throws deep, bad run game and brutal defense. Winston will be a very good fantasy QB starting Week 6. https://t.co/ApWU9k1cGz
@CDCarter13 Pretty good
Today's pod! Recapping all of week 4, including the Bears, NE RB, Kerryon, more Boyd and Ridley, injury updates and so much more https://t.co/TO3OQCp2eh
@RobbSilverstein @DanielDopp @fantasyfocus @DanielDopp Make this happen if you can please.
And Jared Cook is balling. https://t.co/YOQCsvJHMP
First 4 games of 2016 for Matt Ryan (MVP, QB2 in FF): 1,473 passing yards, 11 total TD's, 107.6 fantasy points. First 4 games of 2018 for Matt Ryan: 1,316 passing yards, 12 total TD's, 109 fantasy points Next 3 games: @PIT, TB, NYG https://t.co/lCNdPX4cWX
Breaking down all of the Week 4 action LIVE on the @fantasyfocus podcast. Is MVP Matt Ryan back? Are Andy Dalton/Joe Flacco more than streamers? Is the Bears offense that good or the Bucs defense that bad? Tune in! https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
At his current pace, Julio Jones will finish 2018 with 2,008 receiving yards and 0 touchdowns.
Wow. Two brutal early whistles in CLE-OAK. One takes away a long likely TD by Lynch. And now a fumble by Carr is called off. Man that‚Äôs tough.
Much respect. https://t.co/JnfW368Vst
How do Saints fans feel about Ted Ginn right now?
Correction. He‚Äôs the back-up to the back-up. https://t.co/XGg1H38AqX
As Mike Davis scores again, thinking about what could have been with Chris Carson today. https://t.co/Ob1dQceXF0
@Swann12 @ESPNFantasy That‚Äôs awesome. Can you email me more details about the league and everyone involved? MatthewBerryTMR at gmail. Thanks!
Tons of brutal drops today. Ben Watson in the end zone being the most recent....
The alerts on @FantasyLifeApp crush it https://t.co/OocJlEmfP0
Calvin Ridley: multiple TD catches in consecutive games. Julio Jones has one multi-TD reception effort over his last 47 regular games.
You can only hope to contain Calvin Ridley
@FreedBryce That seems excessive.
Nyheim Hines with at least 4 catches for the 3rd time this season. Scores for the 2nd time in 3 weeks. Over 85% available in ESPN leagues.
2015-2017, we had 2 instances in which a QB had a 6 TD pass game. Mahomes and now Mitchell Trubisky.
Wow. Chris Carson OUT. Rashad Penny gets his chance. https://t.co/viGHd7p0AD
It‚Äôs been more than a calendar year since the last time Zeke didn‚Äôt rack up at least 115 total yards or a TD in a game he played.
Still time left in the first half this week, but QBs have 923 passing yards and 10 TDs in first halves against the Bucs this season. Trubisky with his 5th TD pass of the half (not to mention a team high 53 rushing yards).
Alvin Kamara scored his first TD in his third game last season. Aaron Jones gets in ... it‚Äôs his 2nd game. IF there‚Äôs a 2018 version of 2017 Kamara (bigggg IF), as I‚Äôve said all summer, he remains my pick.
I will not tweet about Cordarelle Patterson. I will not tweet about Cordarelle Patterson. I will not tweet about Cordarelle Patterson.
Will Fuller has scored in every game he has played this season. Was WR3 last season when playing with Watson #top10guy
It‚Äôs TE TD day apparently. Jimmy Graham gets in as does Eifert.  Since the beginning of 2015, 19.6% of Tyler Eifert‚Äôs catches have finished in the end zone.
After an uneven Week 1, Trey Burton has caught 9 of his last 10 targets with 2 TDs.
Oh man. TY Hilton to the locker room with a shoulder injury.
Factually correct https://t.co/Tuhh5hfP9e
As @JeffDarlington mentioned on #FFNow ... the ultimate risk/reward. How lucky do you feel? https://t.co/vzQqNCwYyI
ACTIVE: Josh Gordon, Alshon Jeffrey, Gronk, L McCoy  OUT: Randall Cobb, Corey Clement
Should be a big game for Geronimo Allison in a good matchup. Allison has two scores in 3 games, doble digit fantasy points in all 3 games and is available in 60% of ESPN leagues. Remember, Davante Adams likely to be shadowed by Tre'Davious White (a tough matchup) https://t.co/5uyyRcrwOf
Sal Pal on #FFNow talking about what @mortreport reported earlier - Alshon is expected to play today. WR3 for me with TD upside.
F1 ended early which means E:60 is ending early which means #FFNOW is on the air at 10:12am ET.  See you soon on ESPN2 - let's get you a win!
If you have a last minute question this is a great resource ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/GTI6319sX9
ICYMI - @AdamSchefter reported late last night / early this morning that the following are likely to play today: LeSean McCoy, Keenan Allen, Matt Brieda and Alfred Morris, Doug Baldwin and Larry Fitzgerald.   A reminder: #FFNow starts at 10:30am today due to programming on ESPN2.
I agree with John here. We discussed this on the pod this week as well. https://t.co/QqsGYucO36
In addition to what Adam reports below, given the match-up with the Chargers (and production of Brieda &gt; Morris) sounds like Morris is going to be a risky touchdown dependent low end flex for PPR. Breida should get enough PPR run to return RB2 value https://t.co/MziUQkHcnb
Former Mayor of College Station, yes. Re-elected twice. She got term limited out. She is now the County Commissioner for Brazos County in Texas. https://t.co/RoSzHiUgTb
If Breida or Morris can‚Äôt go, a sneaky deeper PPR play will be Kyle Juszczyk in a game where SF will be trailing. When Beathard played last year he targeted RB‚Äôs at a high rate. https://t.co/3uzao03r6n
I grew up in College Station, my parents still live there &amp; my father is a professor at Texas A&amp;M. I am a proud graduate of  @SyracuseU ... so those are my two college teams. https://t.co/EaBczgJBye
@kiphenry88 Different schedule. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.
Tough tough loss for @CuseFootball - that 4th and 6th... ouch.... but really proud of them. To go into Clemson and take them to the wire is no small feat. Program is heading in six a great direction. Future is bright. #gocuse

@jimcramer My sincere condolences Jim....
Recorded LIVE in front of a sold out crowd last night @CarolinesonBway it‚Äôs the #06010Live pod: https://t.co/NADDog2msy
Among the alerts Ive gotten from the @FantasyLifeApp today.... Doug Baldwin returning to practice this week. Matt Breida, Julio Jones and Devonta Freeman are NOT practicing today.
@ChRlesLeeRay @SPORTSbyBROOKS Um how am I ‚Äúflip flopping‚Äù? I‚Äôve been consistent on both players all year. Obviously I don‚Äôt view their situations alike at all. It‚Äôs your team man. Do what you want.
Make an offer to whoever has him in your league if they think he‚Äôll struggle because of poor performance last week. NE will get that fixed. He‚Äôs gonna be a Fantasy rock star this season. https://t.co/4y0RvXKTDc
I‚Äôve gotten 4 different offers for Sony Michel in the last hour (I have a lot of Michel this yr) in various lgs. I have turned them all down. Anyone is available for the right price, of course, but I think Michel is a league winner this year.
@SPORTSbyBROOKS https://t.co/8d3EhY59ez
Awesome news. @tthasselbeck is a great analyst &amp; a better person. Have loved working with him for many years &amp; I‚Äôm excited I get to do so for many more.

Today‚Äôs pod! A huge Week 3 recap and what‚Äôs it all mean with @Stephania_ESPN @FieldYates @DanielDopp https://t.co/RdVgGGMpAy
Giddy up. Super small sample size but Baker's 9.52 air yards/att was similar to Tyrod's (9.99). All Browns players get a lift here but in terms of actionable items, Antonio Callaway should be a popular pickup this week. He'll be a factor sooner than later. https://t.co/2QjIs3uqYP
fyi https://t.co/uilRXGcYKe
Death, taxes, Mike is on the Chargers. (That said, I agree w/ this)... Even better fantasy days ahead for the Bolts https://t.co/kVSLKaqspJ

Congrats 60% of you. And @DanielDopp https://t.co/3O3RHgA3yZ
Oh man.... https://t.co/gxtj0qsfH5
So what happens now? Almost 11 minutes to go, Patriots down 2 scores.
On an important 3rd and inches, they give ball to Sony Michel and he gets it - bodes well for potential goal line work.
Kenny Golladay is such a pleasure to watch. That‚Äôs all. #babytron
Wow. What a crazy time to make your debut. Josh Rosen into the game to try and rally the Cards back with not a lot of time left in the 4th. Against Chicago. Welcome to the league, kid.
Chris Carson, apparently not ‚Äúgassed‚Äù from special teams, is running with authority. Looks great. 99 total yards, a TD and counting.
And Marvin Jones is ACTIVE https://t.co/7RwU2d8U4q
Josh Gordon officially OUT
Heads up. Unlikely Gordon plays. https://t.co/tqFGRQLnFY
On the day when the Bills crush the Vikes, makes total sense Arizona is taking it Chicago. This league, man. Unreal.
From The Fantasy Show on ESPN+: I interviewed Josh Allen in May at @NFLPA rookie premiere. Really enjoyed taking to him. Great guy and BTW... he‚Äôs a fantasy player. Happy for him and the Bills. #bills #billsvsvikings https://t.co/GQWOK7nhug
That‚Äôs a helluva win, @Redskins #HTTR
Uh oh. Jimmy G down... did not look good.
Players that have had at least 5 catches and a TD reception in 5 straight games since 2010 ... AJ Green, TO, Gates and now Davante Adams.
In the first two weeks of the season, only Mike Evans, Tyreek Hill and Michael Thomas had consecutive games with a 5-80-1 stat line. Tyler Boyd has done it in Weeks 2 and 3. #fantasylongshot #FFNow
Marshawn Lynch misses 9 games and retires for 2016. He still has more rushing TDs than anyone else since 2011. #beastmode
Breida is back in the game
Calvin Ridley is first rookie with 3 TD receptions in a game since Odell Beckham in 2014. https://t.co/7mQtqdK5WW
‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/fxLh6HjGVw
Have yourself a day, Calvin Ridley! https://t.co/yaIQXifzFd
Patrick Mahomes the first QB to have 3 pass TDs and 250 passing yards in 3 straight games within a single season since Cam in 2015. Cam, of course, finished 2015 as the #1 QB in fantasy football.
Most shocking development today?
I‚Äôm gonna have to start inventing words to describe @PatrickMahomes5 .... because I‚Äôve used all the normal ones way too much. Wow.
Oh man. Matt Brieda limping off the field after a non contact injury.
And now over 100 yards with two scores on the day for Ridley. Take a bow, @MikeClayNFL https://t.co/S0pAwptf4k
I‚Äôll cop to it. This Bills-Vikings game is shocking to me. Good for the Bills man. Great to see. Among the crazier stars so far? Josh Allen has more rushing yards than Kirk Cousins has passing yards. Allen has as many completions as Diggs/Thielan have receiving yards combined
Since the beginning of 2015, Kenny Stills is responsible for 25% of Tannehill‚Äôs pass TDs. CC @lewiskay
Funchess with his 9th TD receptions over his last 16 games. And Cam has a rushing score before.  There isn‚Äôt a player with more goal-to-go TD rushes since 2011 than Cam Newton. That was #45 for Newton. #Panthers
The first QB this season with a TD rush of 10+ yards AND a TD pass of 25+ yards in a single game this season?  Josh Allen.
Calvin Ridley now has a TD in consecutive regular season games. Something Julio Jones hasn‚Äôt done since Weeks 1-2 of 2016.
@FieldYates Exactly. Thank you for watching ESPN.
Touchdown for Calvin Ridley. Nice call by @MikeClayNFL who highlighted him this morning on #FFNow during his WR/CB matchup segment.
Bills are up 17 on Minnesota. Because of course they are. Why do I think the Vikings still win this?
Gio Bernard averaged 16.2 PPG in the two games Mixon missed last season. On his way today with an early short rushing score
8 rush TDs (and counting) in his last 10 games. Alex Collins has dealt with a vulture and continues to score. Ceiling is high if they fully commit.
Nice to see him getting GL work. https://t.co/NlBGGHhloF
Royce Freeman TD. He scored last week. And 3 times in the preseason. Phillip Lindsay is legit but Freeman isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
Smart tweet https://t.co/dWuyU5AvwK
Before you set that lineup...give it a read https://t.co/8Y7OEpLvvs
Theo Riddick plays 50% of DET's snaps when they are trailing. (They are big underdogs to NE)... Has the 6th most receptions among RB's....If you are desperate for a PPR flex, I expect him to be busy this week.
My RB10 today https://t.co/JWrfkoH2Fp
Fournette officially OUT, as @AdamSchefter told us early this morning https://t.co/vEuaunV6Au
ALL THE GIO https://t.co/9rqxITVZVg
OUT TODAY: Dalvin Cook; Leonard Fournette; Devonta Freeman; LeSean McCoy; Joe Mixon..... Marquise Goodwin is ACTIVE
.@JosinaAnderson on #FFNow from Washington ... Does not expect to see significant work from Aaron Jones today unless Williams and Montgomery struggle.
Bortles and Corey Grant are viable plays today if you're desperate - also dirt cheap in DFS https://t.co/NoMp507yGa
Sal Pal reporting live from PHILLY on #FFNOW. Says he expects a "A lot of Corey Clement" ... he also expects a lot of looks to Ryan Grant for INDY.
@LuvDanceDream He is unranked for me. That is all I can control.
While I am on TV, if you need specific advice, check out the FREE @FantasyLifeApp below.... its a GREAT resource. https://t.co/DdK2Hq9dXu

@themrbilly Lindsay
This is a surprise. Yeldon a bit banged up as well. Corey Grant a sneaky play for deeper PPR leagues. And Bortles gets an uptick as well - he is a viable QB2 streamer this week. https://t.co/02foc9dhz7
It‚Äôs 100% a gut call but I feel like Sunday night is the Sony Michel coming out party. https://t.co/MheJplCUW1
Textbook definition of it https://t.co/IZ2Bt8qtZW
Thread https://t.co/5eJiMG2CWh
@mattvw9287 @SportsSturm I never said I agreed Fitz &gt; Aikman. There are plenty of QB‚Äôs who put up big Fantasy Points who are not good NFL QB‚Äôs. And vice verse. But the guy who did make point about Fitz never said anything about fantasy football. It‚Äôs a condescending and ignorant take.
You‚Äôre obviously playing Melvin Gordon but is there another Chargers RB you might consider this week? #06010NFL https://t.co/j1VLH6bLIa
Whoa. As @Stephania_ESPN always says - you hate seeing players added to injury report late in the week. Marvin Jones now questionable. Sunday night game as well. Heads up if you have Jones - have an alternative. Golladay stock continuing to rise. https://t.co/U55Nzi19Qj
ICYMI - 50 Facts You Need to Know for Week 3 https://t.co/T4x9P9zwrn
ICYMI: Today‚Äôs pod! Week 3 preview with @Stephania_ESPN @FieldYates @DanielDopp https://t.co/85pEjHVjzO
Since 2015, Todd Gurley &amp; Latavius Murray lead the NFL with 23 goal-to-go rushing TDs. Among players with at least 30 goal-to-go carries since 2015, only Cam (48.7%) &amp; DJ (44.7%) have converted those carries into TDs at a higher rate than Latavius (37.1%). MIN a 17pt fave vs BUF https://t.co/hou1lVNWvW
I am currently on set doing some segments for The Fantasy Show on ESPN+ - updated ranks will come out late this afternoon after all injury reports are in. But to answer a bunch of questions in my TL... yes, but jumps for Ebron, Latavius and Clement.
As discussed earlier. Latavius Murray available in over 60% of ESPN leagues. Strong RB2 with upside for more. Prefer him to Clement. https://t.co/QrLvDQnqj6
Yes. We just discussed on the podcast. There's definitely a legit chance Dalvin misses this week. Remember, MIN plays next Thursday as well. Given this game is vs BUF and they play again so soon, they could take a cautious approach to their franchise RB coming off an ACL injury. https://t.co/OsfCoAtgrl
No Doyle. Sigh. I'm gonna have to rank Ebron as a legit TE1 this week, aren't I? Shaking head gif. https://t.co/snSGW3KfUG
Corey Clement available in almost 50% of ESPN leagues. Top 20 play if Ajayi is out https://t.co/wt0E9IMK85
come join - going through all the week 3 games https://t.co/WtGUXoN493

I like the honesty. Not sure it means he truly commits to more running and if he does, he commits to specifically more Carson (or Penny), but I'm glad for the awareness on his part.

Heading into MNF, only 4 players have 100 rushing yds and 100 receiving yds this season  - Saquon Barkley - James Conner - Austin Ekeler - Adrian Peterson
Wow. A Seferian-Jenkins TD against the Patriots that isn‚Äôt overturned. #stillbitter
When you‚Äôre hot, you‚Äôre hot. https://t.co/81p8bCjfxr
Gonna have to change the definition of ‚ÄúBortling‚Äù ... right now he‚Äôs dealing.
Wow. Keelan Cole with the catch of the year so far.
Ryan Fitzpatrick had 7 TD passes last season. Playing in 6 games. In 6.5 quarters, he has 8 TD passes this season. #FitzMagic
Rex Burkhead &amp; Sony Michel both active. Michel will definitely get some early down work but hard to trust until we see. James White remains my fave NE RB play today.
Roethlisberger and Watson were the only QBs to throw 4+ TDs in consecutive games last season. Mahomes strikes again....
Yeldon and Corey Grant will both see a good amount of work. https://t.co/QFOI28njFX
Since Week 15 of 2017, JuJu Smith Shuster was the top scoring WR entering this week. Keeps it going with a score.
Players with more TDs from scrimmage in 2015 than Melvin Gordon: 343. Players with more since: 0
TD, Jarius Wright ... nice call by @mortreport - Wright was his Fantasy Longshot on #FFNow and Sunday NFL Countdown this morning.
Cam Newton being evaluated in the tent.... dirty dirty hit by Kazee
Nobody had 3 TD passes in each of the first two weeks last season. Mahomes has done so in 2018 ... with more than 3 quarters left to play. #rollinwithmahomies
DeSean Jackson adds another long TD reception (50+ yards). The 23rd of his career of his career. No one else has more than 14 over that stretch.
Mahomes has 6 TD passes this season. Over the past 15 seasons, that is tied for the most TD passes in games 2 and 3 of a career. We aren‚Äôt halfway through the first quarter today. #baller
BTW - my worst nightmare. TD against my Skins and it‚Äôs by not Jack Doyle. Eric Ebron has now caught a TD in 4 of his last 5 games. Luck to TEs is real ... but Ebron? https://t.co/sHGv0R6Qr6
BMW (Big Mike Williams) caught 5 of 6 targets for 81 yards last week. TD in the first drive this week üëÄ. Still available in lots of leagues....
Expect Sony Michel to get some early down work as well.... James White remains my fave NE RB play today https://t.co/EMDQYclGrK
.@JeffDarlington on #FFNow reporting Burkhead has cleared the concussion protocol and assuming no set back in pre-game warm-ups, should get "the bulk of the carries."
Start two of these three. I'll let you guess which two. https://t.co/Hmv3Ko0mX2

ICYMI.... https://t.co/zEs7xWDqhX
Also, now w/ Rodgers expected to start, books have put out a line on the game. @betmybookie has MIN favored by 3, with an O/U of 44 1/2. I have ARod as QB7, Cobb as WR20, Adams as WR22. ARod will play mostly from shotgun which favors Cobb. Adams gets Rhodes. https://t.co/5Wt4TkxLFY
He‚Äôs Rodgers so I‚Äôd never doubt him but playing one leg vs MIN is less than ideal. I have him as a low end QB1 this week. https://t.co/5Wt4TkxLFY
T.J. Yeldon is somehow still available in 41% of ESPN leagues... Feel Fournette is unlikely to play.... Yeldon my RB19 this week. And for deeper leagues, Corey Grant is my RB35 - expect hiim to get more work than last week.
Thought this was interesting. Already odds on what team Josh Gordon (if he were to be released &amp; not traded obviously) would sign with, per @betmybookie:   NE +150 GB +200 TEN +250 JAX +400 DAL +400 INDY +400 NYG +400 NYJ +500 AZ +600 SEA +600 CHI +1000 PHI +1000 SF +1200
@RockofGibrltar Tweet what? Generic support for a clearly troubled player? While its always appreciated to be lectured on what my responsibility is by a stranger on he internet, I have to say if that‚Äôs what bothers you I‚Äôm not for you, man. Let‚Äôs part peacefully.
Just hand him the ESPY now https://t.co/bym6n9PAjv
@27_EP Actually... yeah. More or less. Before I tweeted what I tweeted. https://t.co/1iIsxKOQ5d
Im sure there will be teams interested in Josh. With no knowledge of anything here, just speculating, I could see the Cowboys, Raiders and maybe the Patriots being interested.
Hopefully a fresh start does everyone some good in this situation. https://t.co/ciIBh2xhQM
Awful. Rooting for Josh to get the help he needs. https://t.co/NCTnJLGn4A
Considering I already have Alex Smith ranked 7 spots ahead of Taylor, yes, I still would. Smith a top 5 play for this week. Taylor a high end QB2. https://t.co/MIpbSzaQsu
Giddy up. Per @betmybookie this game is the highest O/U on the Week 2 slate - 53 1/2 - so you‚Äôre definitely starting all the obvious guys on both sides but this is a game to target if you‚Äôre looking at fringe types as well. And I want no part of PIT or KC D. https://t.co/Rb8moCYXVl
In the first half. https://t.co/GNCxetZvcX
Maybe. I‚Äôm not convinced he gets that much. https://t.co/aaew4PPTj7

What happens when you add @MikeClayNFL analytics to a movie trailer? #TheFantasyShow on ESPN+ https://t.co/woPR5Ztk4p
@JosephFalchetti To do Rankings? Yes. To deal with people on twitter? I‚Äôm vastly underpaid.
@SigmundBloom Maybe I‚Äôm crazy but the O Line issues suggest more running for him - Norv was already aggressive there. Expect it to be even more so on Sunday. Also - Neal/Jones are not small losses for ATL.  Guess we will see.
@Kat_Terrell Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles. You asked for bottom 10, right?
@perezdaniel0811 @FieldYates So is ATL D. I expect a ton of rushing from Cam this week.
@FieldYates The bottom line is this: I appreciate your kind words.
Whatcha think? https://t.co/qSnGCh7EOp
Congrats @DavisMattek! https://t.co/ffCg8aOKPs
@AJMass Hahaha Thanks AJ.
Hahahah. Honored, @TheOnion https://t.co/j80JKtGGCp
CIN is @CAR, @ATL the next two weeks. Solid matchups - Gio likely top 10 for me vs ATL.... https://t.co/omPGnIgcoC
I anticipate a scenario where I play neither. Or any Titan not named Dion Lewis. https://t.co/EYm0fkaduK
Listed as questionable: Aaron Rodgers, Big Ben, Marcus Mariota, DeAndre Hopkins, Davante Adams, Desean Jackson, Sony Michel, Rex Burkhead, Vance McDonald.  Not playing: Devonta Freeman, Marquise Goodwin
Pettis an interesting flyer, especially in DFS. I'd expect Darius Slay to shadow Garcon, which means more looks for Pettis. The SF pass catcher I like the most this week is George Kittle. Kittle still available in 20% of ESPN leagues. Pettis (2 for 61, TD last wk) 96% avail https://t.co/PEDJX2zh6k
You won't be able to make a claim until next week, obviously and we will wait to hear more news on Mixon, but worth noting that Giovanni Bernard is available in 62% of ESPN leagues and would be a top 20 back if Mixon were, in fact, to miss some time. https://t.co/DrrecV8kNd
Ruh-roh https://t.co/ip77jUFLz9
In honor of Josh Allen making his first start of the year, here‚Äôs an interview I did with Josh Allen  at @NFLPA Rookie Premiere that aired on The Fantasy Show on ESPN+. Btw - Josh is one of us.... https://t.co/HLP8lSoj6z
Tevin Coleman becomes a top 15 play. In 3 games without Freeman, Tevin Coleman averaged 19.3 touches and 14.5 points per game in PPR which would be RB13 last year on a PPG basis. https://t.co/hl5hHK9Hys
FWIW @betmybookie has taken the MIN-GB game off the board .... think it‚Äôs a true toss up if he plays. Without ARod, against MIN, would be hard to feel good about any Packer in fantasy this week. https://t.co/N20aazzS39
Buying Adrian Peterson? Loving Run CMC more than normal? Is Tom Brady Sackonville proof? Those answers and more as we break down Week 2 on the @fantasyfocus podcast right now  https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI

@TravChildress Ha! Yes, I am
@cjack5214 A little, yeah
@Mikefiggs It takes less time, yes.
@Rudolph218 Can you send me details about that? Your wife sounds amazing. MatthewBerrytmr @ Gmail.
@_JohnGonz @ColleenWolfeNFL @michaelirvin88 @ReggieBush @nflnetwork @AroundTheNFL I saw that. Congrats to both of you guys!!!
Love John Brown. And so does Joe Flacco.
In related news I am playing @mortreport in our 16 team ‚ÄúWar Room‚Äù league this week. His QB is Dalton. Of course he‚Äôs having the game of his life. OF COURSE HE IS. #bitterberry https://t.co/6y0TBamsWI
Buck Allen vulturing the TD is not ideal, obviously - we saw him do that some last year as well. But Collins still has 7 TD in his last 8 games entering tonight. Let‚Äôs see how the whole game plays out before conpletely panicking.
Everyone who had Green last year is asking the same thing. Meanwhile, Dalton is in a prime time game and dealing. WTH. https://t.co/xl9pW1HGfg

Today on @fantasyfocus we‚Äôre talking about 3 things we‚Äôre watching out for in Week 2 and previewing Bengals-Ravens! We're live now - come watch. https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
@LateRoundQB Honestly, in many categories, Jeff is top 1.
I wish this clip was longer.... I've said it before, I will say it again. Not being "hot takey" or anything but I genuinely believe, when all is said and done, McVay will be one of the top 5 coaches of all time. He's unreal, man. https://t.co/03651pRBVD
@Pilamman @all_biz No. We will have a new one tomorrow. Thanks
@RockChalk_12 @Stephania_ESPN @FieldYates @DanielDopp Amazing
@AustinParent2 thanks for your donation!
@Pilamman That's a great question I don't know the answer to. But we should if we don't. Thanks, I will look into it. @all_biz
When I wore this shirt during the FF Marathon I got a ton of questions about it. It‚Äôs now available - as a #prime selection - at the #FantasyLife  shop on @amazon .... code: 10FLSEASON gets you 10% off ALL FL shirts &amp; tumblers through 9/17.  https://t.co/ZyDDXsxx06 https://t.co/99flfcfNb7
Derrick Henry could certainly have a good game on Sunday, but I just don't know how you could trust him enough to start him based on last week in a 10 team league.... https://t.co/46bbor9nDi
Watch Kenjon Barner have 4 touchdowns Sunday. #jonasgray https://t.co/y2YpFbHXzD
In the next tweet, @DougKyed notes that they actually saw Rex participate at the start of practice, including individual drills so this is an odd one. But heads up... obviously an important story to monitor. https://t.co/evA8AhUwrv
@ScottOverland @ESPNFantasy A little, yeah
Today's #06010NFL pod... Week 2 rankings reaction... Brady at JAX, WSH vs IND, can you trust Derrick Henry this week &amp; much, much more https://t.co/PeQ29818Ja

What Evan said https://t.co/SNtR2daFKF
Good stuff Mike https://t.co/EbO40B8lNP
This is unbelievable. https://t.co/4eRYbjAFim
@FFHitman This is a strong tweet.
Chris Godwin has gotten 45+ snaps in a game 3 times in his career. He averages 16.2 PPG in those games. He has two career games with 50+ snaps... he had over 90 rec yards in both games. Available in 66% of ESPN leagues. https://t.co/pkhSWUQovL
@SanFan22 @MichaelSalfino @scott_pianowski @breakfast_pod @NateRavitz Yes that was Nate and I on the baseball podcast many moons ago. Thanks for remembering.
Today‚Äôs pod! @MikeClayNFL joins @FieldYates &amp; I to discuss both MNF games (are Enunwa/Cook for real, panic on Stafford, Golladay over Jones?), week 2 waivers &amp; things we learned from Week 2.  https://t.co/sDhkBDV1EY
@TheSeigeDFS @EliotCrist I've talked about Kittle a ton
@EliotCrist @TheSeigeDFS Spend a day in my mentions and see the kind of questions I get asked. Will definitely surprise you. Disagree on 10 tm leagues not being good. They're fun. Just a different exercise in decision making. I'm a fan of people enjoying FF. 10 team leagues are an easy entry pt for all.
@TheSeigeDFS @EliotCrist He was my TE11 coming into the season but yes, he's available in 63% of ESPN leagues. Guessing you guys don't play in 10 team leagues where you start 1 TE with no TE bonus scoring but millions upon millions do.
Guessing you might need a TE this week. George Kittle, Jared Cook and Antonio Gates highlight the TE options on the wire. How do we order them? Check us out live now at the @fantasyfocus podcast.  https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
On the @fantasyfocus today, is it too early to panic on Amari Cooper? Is Quincy Enunwa the top receiver for the Jets? Waivers + @mikeclaynfl joins us! Tune in! https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
Among the reasons Jared Cook is going off. Also, you know I hate to admit it but..... he‚Äôs legit playing well. https://t.co/4ZOzNWybZO
Gotta say, I‚Äôm really enjoying @ESPNBooger role on MNF.
That doesn‚Äôt seem ideal.  @DanielDopp https://t.co/xT3lfoHdlp
@LateRoundQB We discussed this briefly on the podcast this morning. I‚Äôm of the same mind. Huge Aaron Jones fan but they can‚Äôt take any chances. Jamaal is who they trust most back there.
@DanielDopp @tilianpearson I object to the phrase ‚Äútv star.‚Äù  Try digital streaming video personality.
Of course Jared Cook is going off. OF COURSE HE IS. https://t.co/0KYpsKqqnt
BEAST. MODE.
Also.... per @betmybookie ... Det was a 7.5 point favorite. The O/U was 44.5.  Jets beat the over BY THEMSELVES. On the road. With the youngest QB to make a start in NFL history. https://t.co/9klQ5jiqyl
Stafford was off but Jets D is legit. https://t.co/Vjt9EL9Mv7
I honestly thought nothing in week 1 would be as shocking as Tampa coming into NO and Fitz Magic having a 40+ fantasy day. Seeing how bad Stafford looks while Darnold is flat out dealing beats it. What an awful loss for Detroit. And man oh man... congrats NYJ fans. You got a QB
Whew https://t.co/Ym6Dd6pXr4
For those of you with Stafford at QB... https://t.co/xlmDtgIW4l
@DanielDopp If you need to talk, I‚Äôm here for you.
Ruh roh
Give Stafford a break. Never easy to make your first ever start on the road on MNF .... I‚Äôm sorry. What? Ah. .... Um never mind.
New 06010 pod: We break down all of Week 1‚Äôs action.  What‚Äôs real, what isn‚Äôt, what injuries worry you? https://t.co/EhNDVx9upp
ü§î https://t.co/O9TLL3zGlb
Much respect for @BobLeyESPN who is not only a broadcasting legend but is very generous with his time and advice to many, including a grateful me. https://t.co/jm6NrxBjrl
Trey Burton ran 33 routes yesterday and stayed into block just 3 times. Was second on the team in targets. Tough fantasy day, I know, but I am hanging tough.
Alex Collins got 15 of 25 RB snaps and 4 of 5 touches when the game was within 14 points. I'm not worried about Collins moving forward as BALT's lead back
We‚Äôve got the Saints/Bucs game coming up in our Week 1 recap. We are doing the @fantasyfocus podcast live now! https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
Running through all of yesterday‚Äôs action. What was real? What was fluky? Tune in to @fantasyfocus and find out! https://t.co/JFI54oEwKI
Not 100% rostered in ESPN leagues.... and gets the Colts next week https://t.co/z7hSqWAQYB
Oh no
Brutal https://t.co/ojezdIppNf
That‚Äôs a nice win @Redskins #HTTR
Gotta say. SAY. #stupidautocorrect https://t.co/4FCCxEmfAE
Gotta day Phillip Lindsay looks really good. Knew DEN liked him, didn‚Äôt think he would get this much run this early.
And CMC gets vultured. #ofcourse #bitterberry https://t.co/tKXhJWqQWn
Just showed Greg Olsen on the sideline in a walking boot.
Man oh man is Patrick Mahomes gonna be fun to watch this year. What a throw for his third TD of the game.
Alex Smith to Jordan Reed. TD. That‚Äôll work.
There‚Äôs 7 minutes left in the first half of the first game. https://t.co/gI0pHF0wIG
Now out for the game https://t.co/d1lfb1iDKq
Man I feel for Cleveland.
And looks good - running strong https://t.co/eLhm6IHe0S
Tyreek Hill with a huge Fantasy Day....and there‚Äôs 6 minutes left in the 1st.
JOSH!!!!!!
QBs over the past 15 years with a single game of 400 pass yards, 4 pass TD, 8 rushes, and a rush TD ... Aaron Rodgers and......Ryan Fitzpatrick. #BucUp
List of players with a game in which they had ... at least 8 rushes, 330 passing yards AND at least 3 passing TDs since 2014: Cam (twice), Watson, Wilson and now ... Ryan FitzMagic
Meanwhile, great pass even better catch by Dante Pettis. SF with a TD.
So much for the Saints D. Fitz carving them up. This time it‚Äôs a 50 yard TD pass to Mike Evans. Bucs with over 400 yards of total offense.
James Conner has 27.2 fantasy points today on 14 touches. Le‚ÄôVeon Bell had 20.8 points on 44 touches through his first 2 games last season üëÄ
I mean... https://t.co/bJ6lCWtU3c
Flacco is 0.1 points away from matching his best game of 2017. Still lots of time left ... in the 3rd quarter.
JuJu had a league-high 332 receiving yards over the final 3 weeks of last season. Up over 100 again today after that 67 yarder.
Joe Flacco led the NFL in pass attempts from Week 13 on last season. 32 attempts already today.
Chris Godwin didn‚Äôt catch a TD in his first 15 games last season. Finished 2017 with a 7-111-1 line against these Saints. 3-41-1 so far today. Saints twice, but encouraging nonetheless, especially after a strong pre-season. https://t.co/s0CfuMzhra
Another great catch for Godwin- this time for a score. Fitz is dealing.
Brady to James White. No QB has more passing TDs to RBs over the past 3+ seasons (24) and White came into this season as the only RB with 3+ TD catches in each of the past 3 seasons
https://t.co/OuTm7tEdDU
Austin Seferian-Jenkins, who had 37 touchdowns overturned last year, has another one as a TD catch comes back on a penalty.
John Brown is averaging 3.07 FP per catch for his career. Antonio Brown averaged 3.05 last year. VERY different volume obviously, but the opportunity for John is veryyyyy interesting now that he is healthy and with a team that believes in him. https://t.co/wQ2TKIVYgO
Stefon Diggs and DeAndre Hopkins entered the week tied for the longest active streaks with a TD catch. Diggs extends it with a 22 yarder.
Been talkinh about how much they like John Brown for a while now. He cashes in with a 7 yard TD reception. Psst - he‚Äôs available in 80% of ESPN leagues
Fitz Magic! Fitzy lowers his head and Rams into the end zone for a rushing TD. Because of course he does.
Blake Bortles ties Eli Manning for the 2nd most INTs since he entered the league. An underrated storyline to watch is  who leaves this game with the ‚Äúlead.‚Äù
Alex Collins with an NFL-high 7 rushing scores (and counting) in his last 8 games. I wish I had more Collins this year. Only have him in a handful of leagues. Big year coming.
DeSean Jackson with a deep TD. He now has 22 TD catches on 50+ yard gains for his career. Jordy Nelson is 2nd over that stretch ... with 14. https://t.co/k02awgypLd
3 touches and a TD for Kamara. He ranked 3rd among qualified players (first among RBs) in touchdowns per touch last season. Regression? Maybe. But not yet.
Best of luck today and for the season. And remember ... no matter what happens today... it can always be worse. You could be this guy. #FantasyLife https://t.co/qUmFl7zH8T
Some players that are not rostered in very many league that I am looking forward to seeing today (and who I believe will have larger roles than expected).... John Bown, TreQuan Smith, Brandon Marshall &amp; David Moore, Courtland Sutton, Ricky-Seals Jones, Jeremy Hill, Kyle Juszcyk.
Heads up.... As always @MikeClayNFL doin work https://t.co/uvFmr2WgX8
@BarstoolBigCat You're not the best in the business for nothing
For the record, I know the plan is 20 snaps for Gordon, but I bet once the game gets going, especially if this game is close, he plays more. I have him in a number of leagues and I'm starting him in all. Definitely risky ... https://t.co/7AnBd9hsYC
B Marsh has looked good in the pre-season and has already developed a connection w/ Russell Wilson. Remember, Graham had double digit TDs last year in this role. https://t.co/tAc0Jz08yJ
@MikeClayNFL It's early.
A healthy scratch for Ronald Jones..... https://t.co/JD3boESWFo
.@DanGrazianoESPN on #FFNow saying they have a plan for Josh Gordon, but after talking to coaches "gonna be hard not to use him" after a great week of practice. High upside risk/reward flex. My WR29. Also - weather did NOT look that bad...upgrade given what we were expecting.
Coming up NEXT on #FFNow ... @DanGrazianoESPN will be LIVE from Cleveland. Chance ot get a live look at the weather.... plus reports on weather, J Gordon usage &amp; much more
We just had Sal Pal from New England, talking Patriots RB. He talked up James White and Rex (I have them ranked Rex and then White, but both in top 25)... BUT Jeremy Hill will be involved today. he will defintely get some work. A worthwhile roster stash before games start.
@minakimes @diannaESPN https://t.co/rRyK9NgQDA
.@diannaESPN reporting from Minnesota on #FFNow that Alfred Morris will get the start and she expects that while it'll be a committee, Morris gets first crack and should get the most touches of any SF RB.
DeDe Westbrook made his deubt in Week 11 last yr. Throw that out. Week 12-16 last year., DeDe was WR24 in fantasy points and Keelan Cole was WR7. I expect Moncrief to see Jenkins the most....Rank em Cole/Dede/Moncrief
Important context to our Bell discussion on air. https://t.co/qu40lJn1m4
If you need specific last minute advice, jump into @FantasyLifeApp ... it's free and you can post polls, questions, jump inot a chat and more... get immeadiate and specific feedback.

And Happy Hanukkah! https://t.co/b8PPWFnurr
ICYMI - news came late last night / early this morning. https://t.co/FqpK3AHnuC
Agree with all 3 https://t.co/YZNltgph0s
I'll say it again. Kellen Mond is so damn tough. Kellen Football
I'll be damned. #gigem
Wow Refs  have had a tough time in the #ClemsonAtTAMU game. Brutal brutal call against the Aggies here. That, and the no call on the bad push off... A+M has made some mistakes but wow. That's just brutal.
@ShortBusRyder @TAMU The push off was a pretty bad no call .... but can't get into the RZ that many times in the first half and keep coming up empty. Still - they're haning in a game that a lot of teams would have just given up in
Holy crap is Kellen Mond gutty. @TAMU football may be a year or two away for Jimbo but they are going to give a bunch of teams fits this year. They don't quit. #GigEm
@FieldYates Done and done. @DanielDopp make this happen.
@theechrisdavis I prefer Royce.
Kamara is the only NO RB you can trust tomorrow - even in the deepest of leagues https://t.co/kyIEEc4ODM
@Rmdnc10 @gregolsen88 @tylereifert You certainly don‚Äôt two bench QB‚Äôs assuming it‚Äôs a 1 QB league. I like Eifert tomorrow.
@jphilinaz Over a guy that might play limited snaps in a monsoon? Yes.
So much for the report that he would report today. Will be a story that doesn‚Äôt go away until he shows, if he does. Can‚Äôt imagine Bell plays next week either at this point. https://t.co/vVGSIcm5Mn
I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúconfident‚Äù in Gordon. Still risk/reward. Bad weather goes both ways. Could easily see a short slant or something to him, defender gets bad footing / slippery tackle &amp;  he‚Äôs off to the races. But definite risk too. I‚Äôd play Baldwin over him. Love White tomorrow https://t.co/ymVzVlD6b3
No one had more TD passes on the road last year than Goff. https://t.co/GNJXlAfTUf
@DropThePuck74 Would not drop him.
Per @betmybookie the O/U on this game has moved from 46 on Tuesday down to 41.5...lower scoring expected due to weather.  You‚Äôre still starting the normal stars but lower expectations. Still think Tyrod has some QB2 appeal b/c of his rushing but Goff &amp; Dalton are better streamers https://t.co/f9H7isbSUc
I agree with Mike. Love the potential of Ajayi but wouldn‚Äôt be crowing after TNF. He‚Äôs a flex with TD upside. That said, he looked good in second half and my expectation is usage goes up. But there‚Äôs a reason I had Sproles ranked preseason. The ageless one is going to be a thing. https://t.co/Om2rsgpcfG
Exactly! https://t.co/gmEOZPh7Ry
We just drafted a defense in the 8th of a ten team league. I just nodded and kissed her as I made the pick. https://t.co/npUJBOzaCH
Then everyone told her it wasn‚Äôt the best pick &amp; when she asked me I had to gently tell I might have gone another way. She felt bad &amp; drafted Brees. So...we upgrade at QB but we‚Äôve now drafted 2 QB‚Äôs the 1st 6 rounds. I‚Äôve said nothing. In case anyone wonders if I love this woman https://t.co/fNTltdMZmb
Doing a draft with the kids because they wanted to do one last one. I co-own a team with my wife. She‚Äôs the one picking. With Cam on down still avail, my wife wanted a QB in rd 4. She wanted Ben. So I drafted Ben. In the 4th. QB3. If that‚Äôs not true love, I don‚Äôt know what is.
Last year, the Titans allowed the 4th most slot TDs and the 9th most slot receptions. They play Miami this week, where Danny Amendola is available in 45% of ESPN leagues.
New pod! Week 1 preview, PHI-ATL reactions... https://t.co/k1DPJugoNI

@MikeClayNFL But THIS is the year they are going to target Julio in the red zone. They promised and everything. https://t.co/pV1jjS9MK3
WOW. Come on Falcons. Gotta convert that.
@the06010board @Stephania_ESPN https://t.co/kJIldEEB8R
@RyanGagnon12 Ah, we had a good run.
As expected. I like Agholor tonight.  When Foles in under center, Agholor's target share was 22.7% last year. ATL allowed the 4th most slot TD's last year &amp; allowed the 3rd highest completion percentage when opponent's targeted the slot https://t.co/Jyug7OKpP1
Two things about @dariusrucker in FF ... He is an epic trash talker and he is HARD CORE. He's got a concert tonight in Cincy and will be drafting backstage. Crush 'em on stage tonight Darius! Since, you know, it's not happening in fantasy this year. https://t.co/ICcYs4NZLQ

Again, depends on your philosophy. I would not do this deal - I'd prefer to hang tough and hope for the best. I have Bell in three leagues. I'm not actively shopping him but I'm also open to listening. https://t.co/W6zA5B0bdw
@Zachary_Canny @FieldYates I said in my response that they were D/ST 7 last year and Field was asking because they were being drafted outside the top 20. He was asking in response to ADP
It boils down to comfort level w/risk &amp; what type of player you are. Personally, I am risk averse at top of draft.  I have moved him to RB10 &amp; Conner to RB33. But I wouldn't look sideways if you took him top 4 or let him slip to 2nd rd. Such a wide range of outcomes at this point https://t.co/pa2p3H5aUU
For those still to draft, question on Bell is how risk averse are you? He feels much riskier today than yesterday. Obv, there is tremendous risk/reward for him. Wide range of outcomes for both. Bell could wind up as the #1RB, could sit 8 games.
And what Field said. When even coaches and players are surprised, and his agent said this summer he'd be there by Week 1 (as did LeVeon in tweets this summer)... it's no surprise the rest of the NFL + Fantasy world is shocked as well. https://t.co/Mm81LL2QEO

If you're starting a 49er RB this week, it's Brieda BUT - on road at MIN with workload a question mark I'd look elsewhere. I also still believe that over course of the season Morris &gt; Brieda. https://t.co/gdrnbDSZxj
I agree with everything you just wrote. But he's going to be in a RBBC. He will not get the full workload that some people think he will. Or the workload needed to justify his current ADP. https://t.co/kxwbn7cOuF

A @MikeClayNFL fave from the NFL draft. Will be an interesting GPP play in DFS. https://t.co/761pfJ1v0p
@MikeClayNFL Sweet looking draft board!
Definitely takes a little shine off him but his biggest concern is how they use Tyrell. https://t.co/gjcLVhbtGI
If you combined Henry+Gates last season that player would have been TE3. Remember the Jets game last year where Henry was our? Gates had 6 catches on 8 targets for 81 yards and a TD. https://t.co/6N0mDcc7rB
Over the past 3 years, Rivers ranks when targeting the TE: 4th in yards, 3rd in completions, 2nd in att, 2nd in TDs. The role is his. I just ranked him 12th, behind Kittle and ahead of Eifert/Njoku. He‚Äôll be a ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs‚Äù Jimmy Graham from last year (TE6): TD heavy, low yds
Another alert via @FantasyLifeApp ... Gates has top 12 TE value with Rivers as QB. https://t.co/pkSC29tehm

@kyleberta @danieldop @BedBathBeyond MBFantasyLife @ Gmail
@kiranpa88 A fair point. I very much appreciate all the kind responses. It just feels very self serving and indulgent to RT compliments (and that‚Äôs coming from me!) so I don‚Äôt do that. But I do read and appreciate them. Thanks and enjoy your weekend.
Just updated my ranks (might take a bit for it to show up on the site). My inew initial rank of Morris is RB 20 and I'd be comfortable taking him in the 5th/6th round. Brieda is a big play change of pace guy in the C Thompson/Riddick/J White range for me.
Hey man - I really like Breida as a player. Talented guy. Was surprised Hyde stayed healthy all year (also Breida got banged up). But yeah, liked him as a flyer last year, no doubt. But this yeah, this situation, is different. Given what we know Morris &gt; Breida for me. https://t.co/ldjomAy5tM
In a heartbeat https://t.co/Dl0dZqmPWP
I know, right? I sit here spending my weekend giving free advice to people that have willingly chosen to follow me and look for it. Like you. https://t.co/a7SgfK4bM6
@LetoSal @FantasyLifeApp https://t.co/afQVKU8dOx
@EvanRomano @MaioccoNBCS That article also said ‚Äúassuming health.‚Äù McKinnon‚Äôs injury changes things. But do what you want man. Your team.
Nothing about your statement disproves anything I just said. But it‚Äôs your team man. Draft who you want. I said this afternoon Morris &gt; Breida and I‚Äôm sticking by it. I expect Breida to get in the 12 touch a game area. https://t.co/1SrQD8fz52
Well @MaioccoNBCS wrote it in an article a few hours ago. I suspect others will write Morris &gt; Brieda as well if they haven‚Äôt already. https://t.co/hi5Uie1NIJ
Alfred Morris averages 4.51 YPC &amp; 13.61 PPG for his career when getting 15+ carries. Give him 16 games &amp; that would have been RB11 last season (total points). Also - over the 2 years he was in WSH under Kyle Shanahan he was a top 10 RB. Breida is not built to be an every down RB
ICYMI: Obviously hoping for the best but Morris &amp; Breida need to be rostered and/or drafted in every league. https://t.co/yjwQlnqE1I
I believe Morris would be more likely to score TD‚Äôs. They like both guys. Hence ‚Äúslight‚Äù https://t.co/cPKU5DJARz
Hoping for the best but if something were to happen to McKinnon, in he absence of any news, I‚Äôd prefer Morris slightly over Breida.
In addition to helping the Bears D/ST being a very viable starting D in fantasy, Jordan Howard gets a boost. Expect more second half, positive game flow for Chicago, which favors Howard. https://t.co/58ZYx6P1DZ
Another alert from @FantasyLifeApp ... this time via @DanGrazianoESPN https://t.co/l14jlNIIt9
There‚Äôs no question there‚Äôs a wide range of outcomes with Ajayi and he needs to stay healthy. But if he were to stay healthy and get the majority of work as @Tim_McManus is saying, on that offense, behind that line? Sky‚Äôs the limit. https://t.co/RmVa7fCNYF
Hoping for the best https://t.co/PrqWQfhKzV
Oh man. https://t.co/V7ZXmZSY6j
Could be nothing. Could be something. Already was nervous about McKinnon because of Morris, his doesn‚Äôt help. Morris &amp; Breida should be added in all leagues (or drafted if you‚Äôre drafting this weekend) https://t.co/0TNXf6e1jQ
Also - Jeremy Hill a worth late round deep league flyer and cheap DFS selection for GPPs in week one. https://t.co/MUiUb7OrHG
The @FantasyLifeApp continues to crush on the alerts. https://t.co/hJubJ8KqCP
As you head into drafts, remember the ‚Äúunsexy‚Äù players that don‚Äôt generate a ton of buzz but whose production will outperform their low ADP. We discussed some of them on The Fantasy Show on ESPN+. Here‚Äôs an edited for Twitter version of it. As always @DanielDopp is a gamer. https://t.co/QkXMF1KC6N
Love it. #FantasyLife https://t.co/B8CfIuvEq7
@NotStFarmJake I don‚Äôt agree with that. If your league plays with a kicker you should be forced to draft one.
@jacoblawherlin @gregorybungo Actually, you can set your league rules and settings to do whatever you want on ESPN.
@Paliasterminus @DanielDopp Yes I was hoping Jones would fall back to me. Forgot I was drafting with a bunch of people who have heard me talking Jones up all preseason. Grabbed Penny because I had Carson. But yes - love Jones.
@AndrewEckert2 @fantasyfocus @FieldYates Send this to MBFantasyLife @ Gmail please. And thanks!
@ASmolokoff Never said I invented it and almost every league requires you to leave your draft with a kicker.
Sneaky but perfectly legal FF move: For those that have drafted &amp; waivers are open in thier lg... drop your kicker &amp; pick up a flyer-maybe someone who could see value rise if someone else is cut today. You''ll have to drop someone + grab a K before nxt Sun but you'll have options
@RealBDub23 @bryan_rubin
#FantasyLife https://t.co/8KyxhGvCny
I mean... https://t.co/S9Z2dDdrve
Bears were quietly a top 7 Fantasy defense last year. And now they add Mack? Currently being drafted as D/ST 20 (usually undrafted) I‚Äôve moved them to my #12 D/ST - tough sked w/Rodgers Stafford Cousins twice but still. This is going to be a very good fantasy defense. https://t.co/7E2EpznXXl
Always a challenging league - Need Josh Gordon to be something this year but I‚Äôm happy with how my team turned out. https://t.co/9LhZtM8fSl
@FieldYates He‚Äôs certainly the most humble.

Well? https://t.co/Jji2iYLLUN
Kenyan Drake has never had more than 133 carries in any season, college or pro. If he got the 20 carries a game Gase is promising for 16 games, that‚Äôs 320 carries.
Now, Ajayi did actually get a decent work load in a few games (before, you know, he was traded). In games they won. He also had 13 or fewer carries in 3 of his first 7 games last yr. So if you are banking on that volume for Drake &amp; discounting Gore you‚Äôre assuming MIA is winning.
‚ÄúIf I can get him between 22-25 [carries] that's ideal, and it's a good chance we're winning that ball game.‚Äù That‚Äôs a quote from Adam Gase.   About Jay Ajayi last preseason. https://t.co/GPMCgwUuL3
@jdpres13 Adam Gase said the same thing about Jay Ajayi last year in preseason. Then he traded him. Drake has never had more than 133 carries in any season, college or pro. But okay sure. He‚Äôll get 400 this year.
@chillbh32 Like that team!
@shea_castle It‚Äôs a good name but one I‚Äôve heard many times over many years. Thanks for reading!

Christine Michael is a Fantasy Zombie. Every time you think he‚Äôs dead.... https://t.co/kuaoa99giI
The alternative is just killing it all together. I, and I alone, decided to try and keep it alive as a special part of my TV show. ESPN‚Äôs suggestion was to get rid of it entirely. Everything I wrote in my preseason Love Hate column was 100% true. https://t.co/lLyLTwpuOd
@MauriceShalam Correct
@JRichardBrown It‚Äôll happen automatically
Drafting this weekend? Get @Football_Guys @rotowire, @RotoViz @fboutsiders @RosterWatch &amp; of course ESPN Insider which will soon include ESPN+, which includes the Fantasy Show for dirt cheap. Customized ranks, draft software &amp; much more. See below https://t.co/p12t2V5KUi
August 28th https://t.co/5M6HLr1rEy
Correct. There is a preseason Love Hate on ESPN+ now and there will be a weekly version during the season every Thursday. https://t.co/go1jkjKYQ2
@Rphelps152 Yes! On my list to do when I get back.
@Coach_Burns @OlympiaSports @MBFantasyLife Also available at https://t.co/7BtzPgy2R9!
Wow. https://t.co/Yzjx37vofE
@gmann1800 @MikeClayNFL Did you submit an entry? Reach out to @DanielDopp? Daniel put this guy in.  @FieldYates

Never mind. https://t.co/OT9Fe57xCp
Chris Carson is not going away, no matter how much Fantasy folks want him to. Love Carson‚Äôs ADP  https://t.co/eFR9MKceMq
@MattCreeks @DanielDopp It‚Äôs exclusive to ESPN+ though segments of the show will be online, in the app and on YouTube
@BCF89 @MikeClayNFL @AdamSchefter @KCJoynerTFS In terms of RotoPass it‚Äôs because the tools analysis and customization are top notch and not available for free. You often get what you pay for.
@leonjohn216 @MikeClayNFL @AdamSchefter @KCJoynerTFS It‚Äôs now part of ESPN Insider. And while I get every penny counts, it‚Äôs just 16 cents a day.
@MigTheTig @JeffRatcliffe @4for4_John @evansilva @daltondeldon Thielen &gt; Diggs for me.
Exciting news! ESPN Insider will become part of ESPN+. So if you subscribe to https://t.co/jZhVRYxoXR you get access to written work by @MikeClayNFL @AdamSchefter @KCJoynerTFS more AND can watch The Fantasy Show. + 5 other great sites. Use code: PLUS to get 10% off this week only

@dcc1018 @DanielDopp @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @KyleSoppeESPN @KeithLipscomb @DanielDopp Please add Danielle to the guest list for NYC
Just heard from @DanielDopp ... Tickets to our live 06010 podcast in NYC at Caroline‚Äôs on Broadway went on sale at 3pm ET. At 3:20pm ET we were sold out. 20 minutes - A new record! Thank you NYC! Can‚Äôt wait to see you! @FieldYates @Stephania_ESPN @KyleSoppeESPN @KeithLipscomb
@MikeClayNFL @jwil0007 He‚Äôs coming on this Friday I believe
@BenWolfeATX Nice!
Never claimed Dak wasn‚Äôt efficient. He always is. My argument against Dak is his lack of weapons compared to others, regression in his rushing scores, DAL pace of play &amp; overall depth at the position. https://t.co/4evzxZ5EPK
@FanFBGuru @DanielEnriquez5 @ESPNFantasy And without any injury history who is due for positive TD regression this year.
Thank you! https://t.co/H2RdUGX4C0
@ScottFish24 Ahem. https://t.co/RojNPNfEZB https://t.co/l8EkaJ58iT

No. https://t.co/MWHx0EWPnV
If only there was a way for you to not hear from me on Twitter. https://t.co/bOM3M6y3J3
AP may not be very good and still fall into the end zone enough to be fantasy relevant. Worth a flier but like a 10th round or later one. I‚Äôll update my ranks tonight - he‚Äôll be higher than Kelley or Perine.
Some positives however: WSH ranked 10th in goal-to-go rush rate last season (54.7%) &amp; if you combined Perine &amp; Kelley last year, that RB would have tied for third in goal to go rush att. I expect a healthy WSH O line to be a lot better this yr &amp; Smith‚Äôs mobility is a plus as well
AP‚Äôs best games last year were against very poor run defenses. When he played good teams, he was ineffective. Since 2016, WSH rank 26th in rush percentage. AP ranks 56 of 57 qualified RBs (min. 150 carries) in yards per carry AFTER first contact. Just behind Paul Perkins.
Get on a plane to take your kid to college &amp; your team signs AP. #ofcourse.  Some thoughts: If you just need RB depth, you sign a guy like Darkwa (whose numbers last yr stack up favorably to AP, incidentally). AP &amp; attention he brings is not worth it if he‚Äôs not starting....
@MattSearing @DanielDopp @ScottSheriff My man!
@DanielDopp @ScottSheriff I‚Äôm gonna trust the actual professional musician here.

@FFHitman Congrats!
@Maize_N_Blue__ If you have video of this can you send it to @bryan_rubin ? We‚Äôd like to put it on TV
Love it! #06010 https://t.co/Qgs9vrstbP
Heard he just signed a 3 picture deal with Disney. https://t.co/5amNTTHnjL
@Thekindvillain @bryan_rubin will let you know
@__DavidJoseph Not sure on that. At moment it‚Äôs last ever though I‚Äôm reserving my right to waffle.
@gibeaut99 @ESPNFantasy @FieldYates If you draft Jiimmy Graham as a top 7 TE hoping for Charles Clay in Miami numbers I can‚Äôt help you....
Exactly. Jared Cook has 3 touchdowns in 2 years. Three. And that includes a year with the best QB in the NFL. https://t.co/GUAsXKFhl2
@DjExclusive614 Yes. In a few weeks.
When you realize your work on this Earth is not done. What in the actual.... https://t.co/WbA1AUi1od
