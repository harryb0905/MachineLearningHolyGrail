Thats great stuff:) I‚Äôm very disappointed in the press saying a 5 page resolution means its  aoc ‚Äòs vision of a green new deal- that‚Äôs a set up from establishment - in an effort to further blackout the movement -@OurRevolution @350  And so many others - https://t.co/sN4dq1g6i0

3. We not me- Press don‚Äôt make a farce of this -  Make note of the media blackout of the @OurRevolution  @TheSandersInst  @SenSanders  And it‚Äôs connection to  this resolution -
2. David Turnbull of Oil Change International says that resolution has ‚Äúclear and explicit goals outlined for renewable energy development‚Äù but has no clear ‚Äúparallel goal outlined for the imperative of a managed decline of fossil fuel production.‚Äù - no one ‚Äúowns ‚Äú this vision
1 .On the 5 page resolution From Mother Jones Food &amp; Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, @ Greenpeace this resolution shies away from fossil fuel production, which they consider to be crux of climate fight. David Turnbull of Oil Change International says -

Yeah what bothers me is the inability for people to think a few steps ahead about this stuff https://t.co/b0Q4aD76iO
It‚Äôs a resolution - co sponsored by Ed Markey https://t.co/NPLzlBi0NE
I don‚Äôt see it that way -  I see a lot of her ideas have been den socialist platform -for ages - Is she and her people try to take credit - that‚Äôs aoc buliding - not movemt building - https://t.co/p6axrXaMRt
I‚Äôm glad as long as it‚Äôs fun -for people illkerp doing them- pretty sure they we serving  drinks - some of the questioners were lit up ! https://t.co/kxCA7Q05WE
I repeat-   wanna make green new deal  worthless - have it owned by one individual - not the larger movement politics that created it -  # 1 that not true factually  2 it dumb politics - for too many reasons to repeat https://t.co/L0vDBgchtg

You can‚Äôt see that pelosi and Ed Markey  are setting her up ? Stop playing checkers - and think some chess https://t.co/1sQluwKyRM
Ok - but that‚Äôs the hallmark version of politics -  to be blunt https://t.co/OBCe8tieKZ
I will argue - that the green new deal Can‚Äôt be achieved without a broad movement behind it - of hardcore activists - @SenSanders  has built such a movement on concert with so many progressive orgs- @NicholsUprising  and I were just talking about this today - https://t.co/mu9fsy0kfr
Yes - so pay attention - https://t.co/jhVhf8Y122
I‚Äôm telling u what I see -  &amp; I‚Äôm telling i I hope I‚Äôm wrong - was asked today if she‚Äôd endorse sanders ( not like lots of  dem socialist running )  she didn‚Äôt say - I m hoping he runs -  i got here on dem soc platform-  More like -green new deal  is my vision - which it  ain‚Äôt https://t.co/d4JIUy7BGJ

Oh boy - https://t.co/W0Zm6jMNou
It‚Äôs a curious combination of both -me thinks - as it sadly is - most of the time -it‚Äôs easy to clear up - when he announces  - see if she goes from me to we - - https://t.co/BMgt4NNB4w
so Markey &amp;  pelosi are totally ready to follow AOC &amp;  fight off oil companies walk street insurance companies-&amp; restructure  economy  due to the  a 5 page resolution  pelosi calls  ‚Äú green new dream or whatever it is -‚Äú  Pardon me if I‚Äôm skeptical https://t.co/TEEr7AKrqX
And AOC didn‚Äôt think this all up last year -  it‚Äôs the dem socialist platform she ran on -  So one would hope it would be about movement and not her -  We not me https://t.co/A7UgRN8c6J
Yes - the most important thing is people talk about the one person and not the moment politics -  The most important thing for the New York Times - is to not cover sanders - Pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist - AOC eats up a lot of space in that game - https://t.co/ALVlL5PX4S

That‚Äôs precisely the kind of bullshit transactional  thinking  I‚Äôm warning against -doesn‚Äôt need Him -to become a star?

Dem socialists - should vote for dem socialists - not to hard an idea to comprehend https://t.co/3Foq4cu01A
But I don‚Äôt endorse him even though I ran on exact @OurRevolution  platform ?  And the green new deal - is my vision ?  C‚Äômon people - https://t.co/QhAZUuooZg

Please ‚Ä¶ Chuck Todd: ‚ÄúYou felt the bern last time you‚Äôre still feeling the bern?‚Äù AOC: ‚ÄúI mean, I love Senator Sanders. I think he‚Äôs great.

not endorsing sanders &amp; green new deal not her vision  - She ran on dem soc platform -groups been working on these issues for ages  it‚Äôs just a five page resolution - &amp; estab  is happy to use her to ignore sanders  Why isn‚Äôt she endorsing sanders-   Nuanced  but understandable https://t.co/Fu64Snl2iX
Please bubbah - it‚Äôs an old school political move  is old school it might as we be three ùòæùôñùôßùôô Monty  The resolution isn‚Äôt law -  And she‚Äôs not endorsing sanders -?   Wake up https://t.co/Ub7D9whKAO

I m afraid I am - she‚Äôs  a dem socialist - who‚Äôs not endorsing sanders ?  Think about that - So she  can put forward a resolution (with establishment )  appropriating  name green new deal - AND  people are calling it ‚Äúher vision‚Äù  and she‚Äôs not correcting them?  It‚Äôs  bad https://t.co/k9c7cd1297
She &amp; Ed Markey are going to deconstruct insurance industries/ fight off Wall Street - oil companies  ? She is being used - to distract spotlight from the @OurRevolution  @BernieSanders  truly dangerous ( to the establishment ) policy agenda - that what I see -  The ugly truth - https://t.co/Tn3wvW0yTF
She was asked abt endorsing sanders today - shocker - she equivocated  -u think a five page resolution  put on floor with a old time estab dem- means she‚Äôs leading a international movement ? It‚Äôs so easy ? If she‚Äôs an international movement leader - why isn‚Äôt she w/sanders ? https://t.co/Tn3wvW0yTF
This is not AOC -green new deal  - it‚Äôs more like appropriation by the dnc - of the brand  name - she‚Äôs either naive or greedy for spotlight - is establishment using AOC as an excuse to ignore the more dangerous Sanders mov -co sponsoring the bill with Ed Markey ? Really ? C‚Äômon https://t.co/qrPcKtNbJI

a startling  reality  - 40 % of the American work force - can‚Äôt afford a 400 dollar emergency - Capitalism / neoliberalism  can‚Äôt be tinkered with on the margins - that‚Äôs why  Bernie Sanders scares owner /donar class -  Because he not only gets this -he‚Äôs fighting and winning

It‚Äôs bullshit - &amp; this repeated assault on truth - is just a more refined &amp;clever lie - as opposed to trumps crude lies - but a lie is a lie  - you can put as much lipstick on it as you like -  but your no better than trump  when you spread that bullshit https://t.co/5zMBxzZ0UQ
