@_bursteinlife @jimmykimmel Your comment would carry more weight if you actually knew who you were talking to. You evidently thought you were talking to my non-political brother over at that sports network.
@alexbruns CNNPolitics had Hillary at 91% chance of winning the Monday before Election Day.  New York Times had Hillary at 85%...Reuters/Ipsos poll 90%.... Huffington Post gave Hillary a 98.2% chance of winning, and gave Trump essentially no path to an Electoral College victory..
@alexbruns Sure, it can, but it doesn't. The Rasmussen daily presidential poll usually had Hillary in the lead until it got near the end... then, they were the only ones that got it right. Which network was it that said Hillary had a 98.5% chance of winning all the way to election week?
@alexbruns Read every word of the article. And just because progressive Newsweek thinks that Rasmussen leans toward Trump, doesn't mean it's true.  I'm sure it does to you though.
@dinocitraro @jimmykimmel Go ahead and cherry pick your numbers... And you don't think that CNN has a Progressive agenda?  You don't have to answer that question because we already know.
@_bursteinlife @jimmykimmel How about if we call the Rasmussen poll the only poll that is actually accurate. Their numbers were the most accurate during the campaign.... unlike the manipulative MSM

I'm still "playing with pain". Those who watched me on Tailgate 19 yesterday saw my chipmunk cheek from infected tooth. A bit better today.
Busy one today. Tailgate 19 (Browns pregame show on Cleveland's CBS station) on-air 11-Noon plus visit to Bob Golic's Sports Bar and Grille.

Kudos to CSpan for live coverage (TV & Web) of Freedom Works 912 Protest in Washington, DC. http://bit.ly/9oDSn Where is rest of the media?
When will White House press corp member cry out "you lie" to spokesman Robert Gibbs? Friday he claimed WH was "unaware" of planned 912 rally
2009 season of "Tailgate 19" Cleveland Browns preview show (with me) begins tomorrow. 11AM-Noon WOIO CBS TV-19 and live Paninis Mayfield Hts

Say hallelujah!!! AP is reporting that the Census Bureau has severed ties with ACORN for 2010 Census count. http://tinyurl.com/AcornGone
@gruberted My knees are so much better after dropping 140 lbs, but I'll just settle for a NFL minimum salary based on my years... $820,000
@gruberted I hear that the Cardinals are now transporting Larry Fitzgerald in a recently developed bubblewrap suit.
Free for all Friday / First Timer Friday has turned into Family Friday. Full studio with Karen, our daughter Tawney, Karen's brother & niece
For those who love it when my wife joins me in the studio, Karen (former Raiderette, current restaurateur) is on the air with me right now.
It might help the Browns, but can't help but feel sorry for Troy Polamalu. Injured a knee in last night's game. Bet he'll be a rehab maniac.
@caroline Thanks for your help earlier this week. Here is that "verified account" tweet you requested.

@locusceruleus Cool! You are the first to mention my recent "guest ring announcer" gig at the MMC Blitz event a few weeks ago.
@gruberted Thanks for SBTB-CY comment. It was a great time and a great group of people to work with (cast and crew).

Vote on my poll question through 7 PM EDT at www.WNIR.com "Rep. Joe Wilson yelled 'you lied' to the President - What do you think?"
Putting on my NFL Analyst, blue blazer... the Browns defense will be tested by Adrian Peterson as much, if not more than by Brett Favre.
