@ArloSmartHome sells monthly subscriptions but offers no technical support when they're products fail. @NETGEAR https://t.co/ProFKmqGTE
Let's be honest.... You have no customer service or technical support department do you?  3 days?  Beware of this company!!! @NETGEAR
@NETGEAR does anyone work at #Arlo or is the customer service number just there to fool us into purchasing? Nobody ever answers! @ArloSmartHome #nocustomerservice
@ArloSmartHome you obviously don’t have enough reps to cover the customer service calls. U need to add a call back and hold your place in line option instead of keeping people on hold for hours with that terrible elevator music!!!
@ArloSmartHome the online is just as bad by the way. Added devices but the account won’t apply them.
@ArloSmartHome 408.638.3750 been on hold all day long called 5 times and can never get thru. Good product but HORRENDOUS customer service this is really bad!
@ArloSmartHome so disappointed in your horrible customer service wait times. Been first up on the que for over an hour and nobody picks up. Do u have a customer service???

Everyone is killing JR today but Hill could have won the game b4 all that went down, agreed https://t.co/6AsV22dv9b
He needs to assemble a wartime counsel of “career ending” battle rappers starting with LL, 50, Em, KRS-1, Cube, Ice T, who am I missing?
I agree. But hit em in the pockets too. When ur at war u wanna bankrupt the enemy. Make them starve while u beat em down. https://t.co/jqtK60LAJn

Lebron is Pusha T’ing the Warriors right now &amp; they’re falling for it! He’s gonna get them all ejected for game 2! 🤣
Some people play to win, others not to lose....
I agree with Lebron what was JR Smith thinking?????
How are you Chewbaka tall and miss an uncontested dunk!!!!! Javal McGhee yo 🤦🏾‍♂️......
Ok so #Infrared (a laser beam that u use to aim at your target b4 you shoot) wasn’t the actual shot at Drake, but merely the bait used to get him to jump up &amp; then shoot him with the sniper rifle #StoryofAdonis! It’s levels to this &amp; #PushaT is Yoda right now.
Smh https://t.co/zHRDWiLAgU
After sleeping on it, waking up and talking to one of my boys and realizing I could quote at least 5 crazy verses from #StoryOfAdidon I take it back. If u remember multiple verses from any battle rap then it came hard AF. I agree. https://t.co/iOzkqPkfSS

Agreed. It was disassociating yourself from the trauma caused by her parents. Her eldest son/brother said it”if you have to recover from your childhood, your parents dropped the ball”. And they maliciously discredited her. https://t.co/MVy92DvgJB

@AmericanAir Meanwhile the flight that was scheduled 2 leave 3 hours after ours left b4 us because they had their full crew yet we were missing 1 attendant to leave 2 the same destination. What sense does this make?
@AmericanAir please help out in Charlotte, NC.  Over 1 missing flight attendant, our flight might get cancelled when other flights to LA have been boarded. 🤦🏾‍♂️ smh
@AmericanAir so because we are missing 1 flight attendant, we have been delayed 4 hours and possibly have our flight cancelled. Really @AmericanAir? Come on, we have obligations!

@Jean93437477 Fires are not acts of God like Hurricanes are. Fires are created by man.
If u start a fire to hurt others ur an arsonist. If u don’t turn out a campfire or bonfire properly ur an arsonist. If u flick a cigarette out the window ur an arsonist. Negligence will not save people’s lives or homes.
News covers fires as if they just spring up like rain or snow. Fires are started and should be covered as a criminal act &amp; a manhunt &amp; full prosecution of the perpetrators should follow.
These fires in Cali are being started by someone. Either on purpose or negligence but behind these fires is a person. They need to be locked up for a long time.

Another good one.... @DonnieRadioPR #Wefalldown
And thanks to the @BET &amp; #DMV #OG @DonnieSimpson for creating a positive habit in my life he probably has no idea how much its helped!
What motivates u and puts u in a positive mood? I shared mine, tell me yours..... I want to know
And watch how your day will unfold.... &amp; how u will respond to it
A song, a sermon, a quote, a scripture, a book, a verse, video, speech, whatever. Set the tone first thing upon waking up
If I could share one thing today... it's start your day with something that inspires u. Force positivity in your life, invite it in
Since then I begin everyday with these 2 songs... and it's amazing how that small shift affects EVERYTHING
Every morning was started with a song of hope, motivation, faith, glory, praise and worship. On urban radio!
Growing up in DC, @DonnieSimpson used to start my every morning with that &amp; #Jesusislove by the #Commodores
After hosting the @NAACP closing ceremony, and hearing #SoundsofBlackness perform #Optimistic I was reminded of the power of that song
Little things that make a difference
God works in mysterious and simple ways.... just have to pay attention to signs

@Independent I have a feeling Trump wouldn't care being that he lost California and LA is a sanctuary city.  Maybe he should aim at Mar-a-Lago in FLA.

If we truly believe we're a society of laws then law enforcement also needs laws. Otherwise it's a free for all
Administrative leave doesn't instill any level of accountability either. Leave without pay, health insurance and benefits. Different story.
Besides asking him to leave they have nothing else to do. Police overreach is so common now we forget they were the actual assailants
The police don't work for the airline to enforce their corporate policies. If a passenger is abiding by the law &amp; not posing a threat then..
The media has completely let the Aviation police off the hook. They enforce laws not Airline policies. The passenger broke no laws.
100%. He is unqualified for this job. #SeanSpicer #seanspicerhitler https://t.co/G5aG1kI4z1
Spicer should start freshening up his resume. United will probably be hiring soon, he'd fit right in 🤣😂#US2UA
Spicey is on CNN apologizing. Looks like Kushner got in his ass!
I wonder what Jared Kushner thinks of Spicey's Hitler forgiving comments on the passover holiday smh.... https://t.co/59iIO5drGH
The audacity of the airline prioritizing their business over yours, a paying customer.
Money does not compensate having to be somewhere. That $800 of airlines dollars not even real cash will not help u if u get fired
And if u buy a ticket for a particular flight on a particular day, if you can't do them the favor of giving them your seat thats on them
People have jobs, family obligations, responsibilities, sometimes offering a few bucks is not an option when u have to be somewhere
What makes an airline think offering u what they think u should accept is enough money to get off a flight u paid for?
No matter how nice the neighborhood there's always that one junkyard house with mattresses &amp; beat up furniture on the curb... &amp; a toilet 🚽
Happy #Passover to all my Jewish friends #ChagPesachSameach #Passover2017
Seeing videos like that make me terrified to fly my elderly mom across the country and someone try to bully her into giving up her paid seat
You should NEVER overbook a flight. Even if people don't show up they already paid for that seat. U don't charge twice for the same seat. https://t.co/hfuzHkXxNK

So basically u can't play D on Lebron or you'll get hit with a technical foul.... Got it. #NBAFinals
Pet peeve: "Can I ask you a question?" Don't ask me if u can ask a question, just ask. Cuz technically u already did... 🤔

For you to not pay attention to your child long enough 4 them 2 crawl up &amp; over a fence then down 15 feet in2 a gorilla cage shows ur unfit
Same way the child ended up with a gorilla he could have been kidnapped by a child predator. Child protective services any1? #Harambe
Mother &amp; Father of child that got into the gorilla cage should both get in trouble for their irresponsibility. Fined 2

Disclaimer: I say all this without watching tonights episode 3! LOL #GoT
I know the R+L=J theory but they have deviated from the books. I don't think he has dragon blood. Now Tyrion on the other hand... #GoT
She killed 2 Baratheons already &amp; stole the little blacksmith bastard kid when she foundout he had their blood as well. Obsessed with Snow 2
Everyone swears Jon Snow is a Targaryan. I disagree. Looks more Baratheon than TG. &amp; the Red Witch is obsessed with Baratheon blood #GoT
