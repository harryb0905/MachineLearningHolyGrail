If UW won then I would have gotten a free Husky cupcake every week from @SimplySweetCC The owner is a huge Cougar. Thought I was golden...
#foolishbet
Well because UW lost... During the offseason I have to go into @SimplySweetCC once a week and buy, then eat a Cougar cupcake...
I guess I am eating my own words on this one. I can't believe I made that bet on the game with @SimplySweetCC
@nd_queen22 Hey Nicole how are you doing?
The only question to ask right now is... Will they Coug it?
Come on DAWGS! We have to step it up. Someone take that lid off the basket!
HAHAHA this video is great, check it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfs3BJZxKkc
MSG was crazy last night. I've never seen an arena like that before. We fought hard but came up short. Have to bounce back.
I would have to pick Ron Swanson as well. Even though Phil Dunphy had one mean "soup strainer" at one point in time.
Phil Dunphy vs. Ron Swanson... who is better?
I'm the best man in one of my best friends weddings today. The only question I have is why are there four hours slotted for pictures?
Hanging out at home with the family. So nice to be back and be able to completely relax. Introduced my mom to angry birds, she's hooked.
Home sweet home. So nice to be back in Snohomish!
RIP Coach Gilbertson. You touched my life along with thousands of others. We lost a great man, coach, and example of a life well lived.
Milwaukee weather plays tricks on my mind. When it's 38 degrees outside it makes me feel like I should be wearing shorts and flip flops.
It's an all you can eat sushi night!
This is a crazy statistic RT @JimmyWayne: Americans eat approximately 100 acres of pizza each day, or 350 slices per second.
Good morning everyone. Hope y'all are enjoying the weekend.
I'm loving the new single from @davidnail "let it rain". Drop whatever it is you're doing, go straight to itunes, and check it out!
And we just... "Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues In the middle of the pouring rain" (actually snowing)
Just... "Put on my blue suede shoes And I boarded the plane"
This is taking way to long... RT @Bucks: We're pulling up to Dulles. We'll go through a security check and we are off to Memphis.
Headed to Memphis. I guess there is supposed to be a snow storm there. We bring our weather with us that's for sure. Cold everywhere we go!
You have to be kidding me... Your car can read you your facebook news feed now? That's rediculous.
@Softykjr what are your thoughts? Are you at the game?
@brettkingma tonight against Detroit
@brettkingma I know you're watching this game. What do you think? Your new court looks nice.
Happy 86th birthday Grandpa! Chances are u'll never see this cause I don't think you know what twitter is. Regardless here's to you Gramps!
Just getting up. My sleeping pattern is jacked. Time to watch the episodes of The Office  I've missed.
Just crawled into bed after a long flight home from the west coast. I was so tired minutes ago but now I'm laying in bed wide awake.
Everyone should follow my good buddy and old teammate @spencerhawes00 trust me he will entertain you.
This video is crazy! Amazing how much times have changed since 1997... http://www.epicfail.com/2011/02/01/1997-fail/
Feels nice to be able to enjoy some sunny weather here in Phoenix. Even though I kinda want to see the blizzard back home in Wisconsin.
@darknightshanky I know I was as shocked as everyone else. That's a tough place to play though and Ken Bones a great coach.
What's going on @davidnail? How are things going?

@farrier03 haha come on it was just a goof. I'm just messin around. You should know that.

Great to see fellow Husky @nate_robinson playing a big roll in the Celtics game #4 finals win.
What does everyone think about this Lakers vs Boston game tonight??? Let me hear what you're thinking.
@HuskyKMA I don't know about everyone else but I have an f-150...
Done with workouts for the day, time to enjoy all this sun!
@RyanAppleby yessir got it all today. Sporting it already bro. Thanks I appreciate it.
@SCUHoops coach what's up? I saw Mike yesterday at the facility didn't see his workout but he seemed to be doing well.
I'm just in Sacramento working out right now. I may need to make it down to LA myself for game #6.
@joejohnson501 watching this game? You hanging in ATL?
@joejohnson501 what up?
@LGSoccerdawg you would think that with the extra money acquired from the merger that would be worked into the equation right? I'd hope so!
I am being asked to see if anyone has any kittens available they are trying to get rid of???
@CoachHop I had a great time! It was a lot of fun being there.
On the other hand it would for sure be awesome seeing the Pac10/Big12 join from a fans perspective. There would be some great games!
Money talks, I feel like that's what it's all about too. Sad but in the end that's all the conferences and NCAA want... $$$$$
What does everyone think about the Pac-10 and Big-12 merger talk? I don't see the advantages behind it. Let me hear what you think?
@Chuy8a he actually grew up in Samammish, WA. About 25min away from Snohomish...

@Nixb19 earthworms were working on friday... Not today tho
@RMcClanaghanNBA haha for now it is. How have workouts been?
You can use whatever you want. Powerbait aint workin either RT @arownsu: @MrJonBrockman i'm assuming you can't use powerbait?
Nope, sounds like I need to be there tho RT @Dizz05: At Lake Oroville the Coho are practically jumping into the boat. Ever fished there?
I'm in a trout fishing tourny RT @arownsu: @MrJonBrockman what you fishing for jon?
In a boat RT @Loganw2324: @MrJonBrockman fly fishing? Or you on a boat?
2nd day in a row of piss poor fishing. Tried everything in the book. Even got as desperate as putting honey baked ham on a hook...
Fishing can get a little frustrating when you are getting skunked! Havnt even got a nibble all day long...
Hey who out ther knows what 'tappin the rockies' means?
Hahaha who here has seen the commercial for the "shake weight" that's the worst invention... But does it work??? @LauraBellBundy thinks so.
Haha seen it! So funny! RT @joelleethegoalE: @MrJonBrockman you gotta watch the SNL shakeweight skit if u havent seen it already
Haha love it RT @LauraBellBundy: What in sam hell inspired 'the shake weight?!' Has anyone seen this commercial? (cont) http://tl.gd/13useq
Its cold. You can see your breath with every word you speak. The lakes like glass with steam rising off it. It's a great day for fishing!
And that's a game. Utah advances, I'm not going to lie I didn't see this one coming at all. Utah is playing great basketball right now!
Chauncy is feeling it! This will be a great finish!
How about that and one finish my Milsap... Wow
Good to see Joey Graham playing well tonight. Its crazy how when someone gets hurt other people step up to the opportunity.
I missed the first half of the #nuggetsvjazz game what does everyone think? Is Denver going to put it to game 7?
@LauraBellBundy hey I'm out on the lake in California during a trout fishing tourny BLASTING your tunes! Huge fan!
Safety first kids... Safety always comes first! http://tweetphoto.com/20539585

Believe it or not this is me right now light fishing the redneck way... Ha classic http://tweetphoto.com/20459004
Gone fishing...
Denver lives to play game 6. We will see if they can put it to game 7. Any comments on the series so far? What do you think?
Like I said last game and as seen in the #hawksvbucks game earlier its not over until the buzzer sounds. A lot of time left still!
You can tell Denver isn't trying to be done for the year yet.
Looks like its going to be a great game! Only 8 teams have ever won a series after being down 3-1. Denver has a tough task!
Will this be the last game of the #nuggetsvjazz series??? What does everyone think?

Watching 30 for 30 "run ricky run". This is a great series. Love the behind the scenes look at things. You can't judge a book by its cover!
@Nixb19 how much are you asking for it?
@Nixb19 that is SWEET! Exactly what I'm looking for. Are you selling it?
Anyone selling or know of someone who is selling a Jeep Wrangler hit me up!
I do both RT @Ryan_Stevenson: @MrJonBrockman you lifting 5 days or in the basketball gym?
At the dog park, the wind just started to pick up. After living in Western Washington all my life I can sense the rain. A storms coming!!!
@OMGitsMandi I have a Vizsla. His names Jaeger and he is 10 months old
Another great day of training, time for a little trip to the dog park.
@Ryan_Stevenson right now I'm taking saturday and sunday off so 5 days on, two days off.
Nope, you always have to be on top of it. I learned a long time ago its easier/less painful to stay in shape than get back into shape.
Headed to the gym after a great weekend. Time to snap back into that workout mode!
Game set match! Utah takes the 3-1 lead over Denver. See yall in the mile high city for game 5!
Melo is heating up with back to back 3's and 39pts... Might be a little to late. Less than a minute left...
Carlos Boozer 13-19 from the field is impressive. He is hitting some real tough shots and putting the Jazz on his shoulders.
Milsap fouling out is huge for the Nuggets bigs. He is a force down low and that might open things up...
RT @Sacfan4life: I just love the NBA....wish I was watching my guys @bigmay42 @mrjonbrockman @jtthekid @dontegreene @cisco32 playin instead!
Like I said 20pt game to an 11pt game. Pts get scored fast. Denver is still in this game. Esp when they put Carmelo back in.
Great thing about the NBA is just when you think a team has lost they get right back in it. Especially a scoring team like Denver!
Salt Lake City is one of my favorite places to play out of all the places we travel too. Seems like you are surrounded by mountains!
Utah is really taking it to Denver right now. When that crowd gets going, that can be a really tough place to play!
Here we are! Haha I can't wait to eat some asparagus! http://tweetphoto.com/19938028

@CoachKiwi all this while you can't work for any extra cash... Athletes have it good, but you can't compare then to normal students...

@CoachKiwi you don't live free, you don't have catered food, you have to pay all your bills. It isn't what you think it is...

Student athletes aren't normal students. Their life is their sport and they deserve to live comfortably...
@jcbmrrs it is impossible for college athletes to get an extra job while training year round don't they deserve to pay bills w/out loans?
@jcbmrrs if they expect to have athlete perform at the highest level shouldn't they be able to afford to eat right and pay bills. It is
Hey @DanaWhite looking forward to the fights tomorrow in Sacramento. What do you have going on tonight?
RT @chris_the_greek: @RGLittleJoe @MrJonBrockman why can't it count as an on-campus job like working in the library or leading campus tours?
@RGLittleJoe they make so much money for the schools theres no reason they should have to skip meals, not be able to turn their heat on etc.
@RGLittleJoe I agree the free education is nice but they should be able to live comfortably. Not have to get loans in order to live...

What a great playoff game! This series just keeps getting better and better. I'm glad the NBA assigned me to this one!
WOW Denver just ran the same shut the gate play for Billups they ran when he tied it up against us in Arco this year.
How many more charges will they call? Once again, defense wins games!!! Doing whatever it takes to win...
The Jazz is one of the best teams in the league at packing the paint. When someone drives they all collapse on the ball!
Who do you think gets the game MVP so far? Also if you're both teams coach who do you want to take the last shot in a close game?
I can only imagine how loud it is in the Pepsi Center right now. Would love to feel all that energy!
The Jazz can't seem to buy a bucket. Denver is playing some great defense making them take some quick bad shots.
Here come the Nuggets!
Utah needs to close this half out right. That would be huge to go into halftime with a 12pt lead.
And here goes Boozer, if he can stretch the defense and keep shooting like this is will help cover for Okur being out.
Amazing the Jazz are still in this game with 9 turnovers. That's what you'd like to have for the game not just the 1st half.
Deron Williams*
Everyone needs to give me some guesses on just how many collective tattoos the Denver Nuggets have. I'm guessing over 200...
The injury bug strikes again for the Utah Jazz. Hopefully Darren Williams can make a return to this game.
Here we go! Game 2 off to yet another quick start. Let's see if the jazz can overcome all their injuries!

GOODNIGHT NEVERLAND!!!!
Sitting outside with friends and family enjoying a great northwest evening! It was a great day in Snohomish (fire, food, family) #hicknation
Now we are pulling out all the meat and it tastes GOOD! http://tweetphoto.com/18999106
We are unwrapping it now http://tweetphoto.com/18998805
There she is. Wrapped in a burlap sack and banana leaves. It smells so good!!! http://tweetphoto.com/18997822
About to dig out our pig... Can't wait to see it http://tweetphoto.com/18996310
Believe it or not the pig still is buried in the pit. We are pulling it out of the ground at 12. Stay tuned for pictures.
That was a great playoff basketball game. Anytime Carmelo goes off for 42 the Nuggets are tough to beat. Ill talk to yall during Game 2!
Getting a little out of hand. Utah has to start putting some stops together on the defensive end. Defense wins games!
HUGE 4th quarter for JR Smith... He is getting this crowd going!
How many more lead changes will there be in this one? I see this one going back and forth to the very end!
Injury to Okur could end up being a huge loss for the already banged up Jazz. With Kirilenko out and Boozer hurt, someone has to step up...
Great to see Wes Mathews on the floor for Utah. He has had one heck of a rookie year. he played summer league in Vegas with us Kings.
Ty Lawson aka 'the blur' is really giving Denver a jump start off the bench. Bench play is crucial for both teams. ENERGY!!! #NUGGETSvJAZZ
Billups is an unbelievable leader. He has played in so many playoff games. He is the type of player that can control every part of the game.
CJ Miles with 13pts so far in the first quarter. I played with him in the high school Mcdonalds All-American game. #NUGGETSvJAZZ
Waiting for the @NUGGETSvJAZZ game to start. This is going to be one physical series! What's everyones predictions?

@Isaiah_Thomas2 haha I'm tellin you zeek, the young fellas never know what's coming... Its always a shock. Lead the way tho
@gaddy0uw but I know that sleep feels so good and no one is even hungry when their dead tired. Its the toughest thing but is so important
@gaddy0uw exactly crazy thing but neutritionists will tell you that 75 percent of your daily food intake should be eatin before 2pm.
@gaddy0uw I feel for you bro. Gotta make sure you get that sleep and food in u. U don't want to be loosing weight
@gaddy0uw what did you learn with conditioning today big fella?
@Cowbell_Kingdom man a dunks a dunk, two points is two points. The way it works is everyone gets dunked on, what goes around comes around ha
We had a good practice today guys were all working really hard ad competing! Things are really looking up! Great time to be a king baby!
@nickcollison4 but country music is the best, I'm sure especially when your driving thru the open range of oklahoma
See I think Jason Bourne would win but there are a lot of factors that come into play. After its all said and done tho I think Bourne wins
In a fight to the death who wins...? James '007' Bond vs Jason Bourne??? Choose wisely!
Eating lunch then nap time before our 2nd practice
@Isaiah_Thomas2 they are going real well. Its good to get back at it and into the swing of things. How's the dub?

Just enjoyed a great service at mars hill church. It always amazes me just how small of a world it really is. God is good.
