I am grateful to my colleagues who have called for due process before weighing judgment. I would urge them to continue to do so for any Member accused of wrongdoing. Basic fairness requires no less.
I‚Äôll never allow that legacy ‚Äì a legacy I owe to my father   John Conyers, Sr., who integrated labor unions, or my two amazing sons John III &amp; Carl and my loving wife Monica, and the extraordinary people of Detroit ‚Äì to be cast aside, or these causes to be in any way diminished.
I am proud and fortunate to be part of a legacy of more than 50 years of fighting for civil rights and making our country more equitable and just.
I cannot in good conscience allow these charges to undermine my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus, and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives.
But I have come to believe that my presence as Ranking Member on the Committee would not serve these efforts while the Ethics Committee investigation is pending.
These challenges could not be more pressing in the face of an Administration that cares little for the rule of law and a President whose actions and conduct cheapens our discourse every day.
To be clear, I would like very much to remain as Ranking Member. There is still much work to be done on core concerns like securing civil rights, enacting meaningful criminal justice reform, and protecting access to the ballot box.
I deny these allegations, many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger. I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics.
After careful consideration and in light of the attention drawn by recent allegations made against me, I have notified the Democratic Leader of my request to step aside as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee during the investigation of these matters.

The @HouseGOP keep spewing #AlternativeFacts about its #GOPTaxScam. They just want to give a tax break to the companies that are sending American jobs overseas.  How does this help folks at home? How does it help American families? How does it grow American jobs?
FACT: 36 MILLION middle class families would see their taxes go up under the #GOPTaxScam.   @HouseGOP, you simply can‚Äôt call a tax bill that is nearly 50% giveaways to the top 1 percent ‚Äúpro-Middle Class.‚Äù That sounds like #fakenews to me.
#HR4140, No Unconstitutional Strike on #NorthKorea Act, w over 70 bipartisan cosponsors in the House &amp; Senate, would underscore the longstanding Constitutional principle of Congress‚Äô sole power to declare war &amp; authorize preemptive military action. I urge its passage w/o delay.
Finally, @realDonaldTrump must publicly acknowledge that he is constitutionally-barred from launching a preemptive war without Congressional approval.  Acknowledging this reality will reduce tensions and provide momentum for diplomatic efforts.  https://t.co/f81f9QnK7R
It is now @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs responsibility to control his impulsive behavior and give diplomacy a chance to work.   Every reckless comment heightens tensions and makes a negotiated solution more difficult.
Despite his unhelpful comments, I am quite encouraged to see that the @WhiteHouse has dispatched negotiators to talk with #NorthKorea.    Pro-diplomacy Members of Congress stand ready to support these efforts however we can.  https://t.co/lQmRaMAEL9
Pleased that @realDonaldTrump was able to avoid reckless threats during his Asia trip, as I urged him to do.  Unfortunately, he cont‚Äôd to claim that military options remain on the table in his speech today.  There can be no military solution to a dispute w a nuclear armed nation.

Further, we cannot refer an investigation to a second special counsel if we lack the evidence to predicate a criminal investigation in the first place.

Rather than tweeting reckless statements, @realDonaldTrump should spend his Asia trip searching for a diplomatic resolution to this conflict
The Framers chose Congress to be the body that declares war and authorizes military action. This legislation reinforces that intent.
Bipartisan and bicameral, H.R 4140 prevents the expenditure of funds for any kind of first strike against North Korea.
As @realDonaldTrump embarks on his trip to Asia, we want to remind him that he cannot attack North Korea without approval from Congress
It is crucial that Congress reaffirm its constitutional authority over approving any first strike against North Korea.

This is not the time for the federal government to retreat from protecting equality in higher education.
Recent signals by the Justice Department hint at a change in administration policy to re-open attacks on affirmative action programs.
While we have made great strides in equality on campuses, mainly as a result of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, controversy remains.
At best, these internal challenges are resolved through rigorous research and debate of the issues involving all stakeholders.
Though America‚Äôs campuses remain a beacon of academic excellence, they also face the same social pressures that infect our society at-large.

Trump chose un-American white supremacists &amp; all who give hatred a voice. This Admin. must reverse its pattern of discriminatory positions.
Bannon should have never been in the WH. However, his removal will not undo the damage or reconcile the hate-filled agenda of Trump Admin.
Steve Bannon is the standard-bearer for the worst instincts in American society. He gave white supremacy, misogyny+anti-Semitism a platform.
Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and continues to embolden these extremist groups and ideals.
Thoroughly disgusted by Trump's #charlottesville statements today. White supremacists, neo-Nazis, racism and hatred are the culprits.

#Republicans are right: thanks to its overwhelming popularity, #MedicareforAll has become the alternative to #Trumpcare.  9/
A majority of @HouseDemocrats are cosponsors of my #MedicareforAll bill.
...coverage to everyone through a government financed healthcare system.  7/
Poll after poll shows that Americans agree that we have a collective obligation to guarantee healthcare...
...with about 60% of Americans in support, so it‚Äôs even more deserving of hearings and a @USCBO score.  5/
My proposal is no different. In fact, #MedicareforAll is far more popular than the status quo or anything Republicans have put forward...
@SenateDems Republicans should be:  1Ô∏è‚É£ holding hearings 2Ô∏è‚É£ soliciting input from the public 3Ô∏è‚É£ carefully weighing analysis from the @USCBO.  3/
The process by which they are considering changes to our nation‚Äôs healthcare plan is a sham &amp; @SenateDems are right not to take part in it.

Today‚Äôs vote makes clear what I‚Äôve been saying for decades: the only way forward is thru a single, national insurance plan: #MedicareforAll.
I don‚Äôt say that to be hyperbolic; it‚Äôs simply a fact that lack of access to care results in preventable deaths. #ProtectOurCare   6/
@SenateGOP Nationwide, premiums will skyrocket for those lucky enough to have insurance &amp; Medicaid will be cut by 1/3-meaning that ppl will likely die.
@SenateGOP The proposals that Republicans have on the table will result in more than 50K people in my district losing coverage. #ProtectOurCare   4/

. @NAACP @ACLU + on #ThinBlueLine: "could ultimately exacerbate existing tension between law enforcement and the communities they serve"
GOP rushed #ThinBlueLine to House floor w/out a SINGLE hearing, avoiding bipartisan efforts to ensure due process for the death penalty.
60% of people currently on federal Death Row are minorities #NoThinBlueLine
GOP should focus on REAL reforms that better protect law enforcement,  first responders, and the communities they serve! #NoThinBlueLine
Some perspective on #MedicareForAll: the record for #HR676 cosponsors was 93 in 2008 (when there were 42 more Dems). #Progress

I will be on the floor speaking out against #TrumpCare and this new attempt rip away care from Americans. LIVE: https://t.co/dD9uIcPien
#TrumpCare punishes Americans that get sick. Taking away healthcare from millions is not the solution. #MedicareForAll is fix to the system
Let's be honest about what #TrumpCare is-A tax break for insurance companies by sacrificing American's healthcare
Patient providers &amp; advocates agree-#TrumpCare will allow insurance companies to discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions https://t.co/9OwQiX9Po8
Who is most hurt by #TrumpCare? 14 million Americans will be kicked off Medicaid-harming children, seniors and people with disabilities https://t.co/zn2yiUZdl5

#regreform is bad because regulations help the economy by ensuring better working conditions, cleaner environment &amp;safeguarded innovation.

Senator Booker and Reps Lewis and Richmond should have been able to provide testimony on a member-only panel at the start of the hearing.

I strongly reject the lack of comity and respect afforded to CBC colleagues testifying at Sessions hearing right now.

"Putting the pensions of our brave police officers, firefighters, &amp; city workers on the chopping block repudiates not only our State law..."
"... an immigration policy which reinvigorates our urban areas. We all want to see a Detroit whose future is as bright &amp; proud as its past."
"...and I plan to continue to push for bills I have already introduced providing Jobs For All, Health Care For All, and..."
"... I also plan to introduce legislation which provides a federal back-stop for the pensions of city workers..."
"...Next week when Congress returns, I plan to reintroduce the Shield Our Streets Act which will provide much needed public safety funds..."
"...Third, the ongoing financial crisis has exposed a number of legal flaws that can and should be addressed through legislation..."
"...the #Obama Administration to maintain and enhance funding and grants for #Detroit..."
"...Second, the #Michigan Congressional delegation needs to continue to work with the City, the State, the non-profit community, and..."
"...First, we need more, not less, public discourse. Today‚Äôs forum is the beginning, not the end of that much needed public dialogue..."
&gt; @RepJohnConyers - "As the elected Congressman for the 13th District of Michigan, let me begin by proposing several specific steps: ..."
"...and how can #Detroit transition into a modern, functional and viable city?"
"...how will the #bankruptcy filing impact our citizens; will we honor our worker‚Äôs pension and health care obligations?..."

Every $1 of #CDBG funding creates $3.55 in private investment. $135 billion in investments in local economies since 1974.

#CDBG program ensures access to affordable #housing, provides services to the most vulnerable in our communities, &amp; creates jobs.

@SpeakerBoehner's Plan B only lowers taxes for those who earn between $200K &amp; $1 million. That's a raw deal for the middle class.
The House #GOP's "Plan B" would allow millionaires to keep their tax cuts. The American people want the wealthy to pay their fair share.
@SpeakerBoehner's so-called ‚ÄòPlan B‚Äô is not a balanced approach to deficit reduction and it should be rejected. #fiscalcliff
Chained CPI would place an increased  burden on elderly Americans. 70% rely on #SocialSecurity for more than 1/2 of their income.
Chained CPI is a #SocialSecurity benefit cut. We cannot ask our seniors and the most vulnerable to bear the burden of deficit reduction.

Health Care Repeal Vote A Time Wasting Political Temper Tantrum http://t.co/9OYVpBlv #ACA #walkthetalk
If GOP really worried about #Medicare solvency, they should support letting feds negotiate lower drug costs. Saves $100 billion over 7 yrs.
GOP attempt to repeal the #ACA could results in 6.6 million young adults being kicked off their parents‚Äô plans.
Instead of repealing the #ACA, we should be talking about ways to strengthen reform with a #publicoption and, eventually, #MedicareForAll
