"No Room for More Risk in Defense Budget, Winnefeld Says" by @garamoneDoDNews http://t.co/BYEQKNDCtM
VCJCS: “That’s what makes this a strategy driven budget, bc we’re asking for what we need above sequester in order to keep risk manageable.”
VCJCS: “unfunded changes to this submission are the same as a reduction and would also require adjustments to the strategy.”
VCJCS: reductions not only down to sequestration, “but anything below the level we’re submitting.”
VCJCS: “when it comes to defending our nation security interests, we chiefs don’t like to hear ‘3rd &amp; manageable’.”
VCJCS Winnefeld on budget: We have little margin left for error or strategic surprise.

"@georgiatech prepared me for my future as it has surely prepared you for yours." - ADM Winnefeld, class of 1978.
#VCJCS wrapping up: "America is more than just a nation. It remains an idea about freedom and liberty"
#VCJCS: people will follow "if they know they're doing it for the betterment of something other than your own reputation."
"No matter what that change looks like, a little humility will do you a lot of good along the way." #VCJCS at @georgiatech
"You'll know you're there when other people start enthusiastically leading the change for you." - ADM Winnefeld
#VCJCS: you have to push that idea through whatever poor unsuspecting system it is in which you operate.
#VCJCS on leading change: First, you have to have a good idea in which you firmly believe.
"I believe it's the main reason you worked so hard to gain the knowledge we will now demand that you put to use." @georgiatech
VCJCS: @georgiatech students are "inventive, enthusiastic, impatient, intellectually rowdy and audacious ... sometimes to a fault."
#VCJCS congratulates grads, reminds them to thank family and staff for support. @georgiatech
