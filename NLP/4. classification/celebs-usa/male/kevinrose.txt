Ride the lightening might be the best Metallica album.
@emopicklerick @om Good question, many of mine have been destroyed...depends on how hot it gets. The Oura has lasted me 20+ sessions, check w/ the manufacturer specs first though!
3. @MakerDAO launching multi-collateral Dai is going to be a huge deal. Dai will likely 10x in marketcap (more Dai issued, not an increase in price). MKR will surge in price.
2. ETH will rebound when they improving scaling later this year. Smart contracts will have real utility. obviously.
1.  Bitcoin will recover and climb once again. Minor improvements in scaling won't matter, its primary use case will be a store of value.

@brooklyn_crypto Agreed
@aarondunlap In having a small child (that‚Äôs constantly moving) portrait mode on iOS takes a certain distance and focusing that can take 10-20 seconds, on Android it‚Äôs instantaneous.
@yungNleveraged Sorry this post triggered that in you.
@ByteForByte Yes, I‚Äôd love to, but @mulligan @joshcook @mmaser @bradmurphy and @ryanvance won‚Äôt switch and give me shit for being on android messages (sms)
And very much in a ‚ÄúI wish I had my pixel with me‚Äù way, a pretty noticeable and meaningful difference
I‚Äôve been bouncing between the iPhone XS and Pixel 3 the last couple weeks. The iPhone apps have more polish and iMessage is a huge reason to prefer the iPhone. That said, the Pixel 3 camera and portrait mode are objectively superior
Such a beneficial practice, congratulations on a year! üôè https://t.co/Eup79rhP3X

@HealthByDiet @ouraring That's a bummer. I had heard they are shipping based on size/color combo availability as they are coming off the line. 10 months is too long, obviously. That said, I will say that mine has been amazing with zero issues. Hope you get yours soon.
Wait, so is the iPhone Xr better or worse than the Xs?

@SinisterOneSD iPhone to iPhone (imessage over wifi data) is noticeably faster vs iPhone to SMS. I think part of this is the client negotiation to determine it's not imesssage and then changing to SMS mode
@calebd HELL YES! Got my X and LOVE it
I've been using my Pixel 2 more. iPhone users don't like texting android users (takes longer), which is actually a very subtle hack to get fewer texts and more free time. ü§î

@adaugelli @courtstarr No doubt. My only point is that multi-day rental cars will be self driving cars in the future, they will come pick you up, stay with  you etc.
@courtstarr @adaugelli Alternatives to cars make sense - bikes, drones, etc.
@courtstarr @adaugelli I don't see how Getaround is an alternative to self-driving cars. In that world, why does Getaround exist?
@adaugelli bold prediction. hmmm

@cvorkink @jumpbikes Exactly.
@gavinpurcell hahah I thought the same thing
@TranslatorBot2k @TwitterMoments @TonyRobbins @TaranaBurke I'm just wishing the public had all the context of the conference. Even with that additional video, it wouldn't excuse anything that was said, period. But it would give others the complete picture, which is never a bad thing.
@TwitterMoments @TonyRobbins @TaranaBurke I was at this event. I'm bummed that there is a chunk of video missing where he clarified his position further. Even pointing out that men should be held accountable / brought to justice for their actions.

@aexmo I understand that the caps are funky, but understanding how your coin fits into the larger picture is important. I've seen tweets thinking TRON is going to $10 this year... (in market cap land we call that "$1 trillion dollars" or "not going to happen")
Re: my last tweet, this is probably better advice üòÇ https://t.co/pUROSFaWGt
Four things to ask yourself before buying an altcoin: 1. Are they solving a real-world problem? 2. Are they press/hype, or shipping code? 3. Do they have the experience needed to build out their vision? 4. Do you understand market cap &amp; how it relates to your price expectations?

@manton2 I'd love to try Micro! (when you get an invite), so would @taramann :)
@taramann Same, who runs this?
I'd like to do more cryptocurrency interviews on my podcast, should I do them in a: (thanks for your feedback)
Also, this could very well be a bubble, many people are buying crypto with the hope of "flipping it" back out to old paper currency. With every group of these people, some will become (holding) true believers. It's believers compounding that will lead to eventual ubiquity
Many calls from family/friends today for crypto advice. My take (not investment advice): If you believe the future is a digital currency, run by the people, then you're holding for life. Replacing old trillion-dollar institutions is going to be very very messy &amp; bumpy, expect it
@TimothyHollems @hitbtc Speaking for myself (not investment advice), this isn't a 3/6/12 month game. If you believe in the future of digital currency, then you're holding for life, and none of this really matters.
@pizzamikey45 @hitbtc oh I am, just getting it off exchanges
@hitbtc To clarify (based on the replies), I'm not withdrawing to USD, just moving crypto around wallets and to other exchanges. #hodl

@VinnyLingham Curious to get your take. I‚Äôm thinking of bit (+forks) as more of a basket of coins, ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù could really be 200+ coins in 50 years, adding to the diversification...?? üßêü§™ Or is that nuts?

@1Password @JonoH Understood. A feature request I‚Äôd have (for advanced users) would be to not backup my secret key to the keychain. Thanks!
@TomSmallwood @1Password I don‚Äôt see it on the keychain

@_JennConnelly Hi Jenn, have a second to chat? Can you DM me the best email address to reach you at? Thanks!
@adholden That‚Äôs a great one, but it‚Äôs a little more dramatic theme music / movie like, are there any quicker podcast intros you like?

@SEGMining I'm in Portland this weekend, around for a coffee?
Big day! @bluebottleroast acquired by Nestle. Huge win for @trueventures. @tonysphere being prescient as usual :)
@Javmadsil So hard to get those, what time?
As crypto grows, centralized systems (banks/gov/etc) will attempt to delegitimize these technologies,their survival depends on it. Buckle up
@sup Please do your own research! Just a project I'm excited about :)
This is the first Apple Watch I‚Äôm really excited about. Less phone time = better.
I‚Äôm tracking a few altcoins, one that I‚Äôm liking is ARK, outstanding wallet, community, PoS delegate system, etc. - https://t.co/wROmA60J0O
@patrickbjohnson Digital currency, it‚Äôs inevitable
Uber = regulation issues. Tesla = no range. Bitcoin = no value. The earlier you accept these are here to stay, the more upside you‚Äôll see.
@Marco_Streng Hey Marco, would love to chat about Genesis, possible to DM me?
Would love to see @amazon build their 2nd HQ in Detroit - https://t.co/dQFj6GJBYg
@Javmadsil @GenesisMining I‚Äôd like to mine lite but they are sold out
@Javmadsil @GenesisMining ETH / Bitcoin
I‚Äôve been using @GenesisMining for a few weeks now (hosted bitcoin/ETH mining), pretty impressed - my code if you want 3% off: AumKYv
@dmaccannell They‚Äôre both atoms backed!
@mohamedmansour Depends on the transaction volume, mining is done at that point
@evanjoebro Meaning if bitcoin hits $100,000 per coin
Bitcoin @ 100k USD/coin = 2.1T USD, or 26% the value of all available gold (8T USD)

@larmanius @TWiT Thanks for watching back then.
@varming You‚Äôre leaving out what I said about violence and racism
@lsuniverse That‚Äôs why I include violence in my description :)
@ward733 I‚Äôm specifically talking about nazis and racism here, I‚Äôm not familiar with Antifa, so I can‚Äôt comment on them
@FiscalTweets @schaeferND I was pointing to racism because I don‚Äôt believe there is any ambiguity there, it‚Äôs an evil act.
@tkcomputer Germany banned all things nazi, why can‚Äôt we? Can‚Äôt we all agree there is no ambiguity when it comes to racism?
@rezich I agree w/ that, I was talking about the very specific and well defined racial hate
@larmanius I‚Äôm certainly talking about new laws and using the court system.
@schaeferND If they are a racist group, yes. I‚Äôm not familiar with them.
@serapheem If the group‚Äôs sole intention is to spread race hate, fear, and violence, then I‚Äôd argue yes. (first time I‚Äôve heard of them)
@TechGrlTweeter So glad it helped you :)
@mjones Who records the transaction on the blockchain?
@joshu You have to pay gas
@adholden Mr. biscuits and ms. puss pockets

@jk0 how do you manage VPN logins?
@gotwalt you have the Edge router? I‚Äôm using the USG

@adamgazz agreed, those are the markets that will spike the sales, initially, then it will die off üòµüíÄ
@adamgazz gamers, geeks, and scientists will love it. Sadly it will go the way of the 3D TV, once a year type use case. Fun idea on paper.
@meltingice friendly wager time, let's take this to slack :)
@meltingice a fad then funding will be pulled back. Remember the nintendo power glove?
@meltingice the only way it will follow that law is w/ the proper funding/development commitment from large tech. once they believe it's
I believe the VR we are seeing today will be a fad. It will do well for a couple years then feel like the Wii remote‚Ä¶
VR would have to be a true 10x improvement over XK HDTV for consumers to adopt it, otherwise it just collects dust in the corner‚Ä¶watch.
@meltingice totally get it, you're just wrong tho :P
The geek in me wants to love it, the consumer in me doesn't want the trouble of strapping something to my head.

@dflieb ‚Ä¶because the locally stored photos from apple are lower rez. Meaning G isn't pulling originals directly from cloud but locally, yea?

@dflieb hmm, so if my iPhone "photos" are set to "optimize iPhone storage" that means G photos app will be uploading lower rez, yea?
@soffes loving it!!? looks awesome

@pinboard re: my product instincts, digg had hundreds of millions of users over the years‚Ä¶ Revision3 network, the same‚Ä¶
@pinboard I'm sure had all three been failures I'd have a hard time raising. That said, I'm self funding North for now, I might never raise
@pinboard and hope they'll find a way to do it again. For me, Milk and Revision3 made all my investors money, Digg returned some
@pinboard I've backed some founders I probably wouldn't back again, and others I'd bath no matter what. I like their product thinking
@jimray same to you, no biggie
@pinboard please explain
@jimray that said, I've certainly had some failures - Milk, Revision3 made investors money, Digg returned around 20% of dollars in.
@Pinboard why all the hate?
@jimray we sold @Revision3 for $35M+, making our investors millions and now it's the digital arm for Discovery.

crazy how they went back into the diggnation archive to find some bad jokes, always knew those would come back at some point.
flyer got cut off, but it also mentioned diggnation, calling it a "terrible program" and quoted my bad joke about scissors and teat
SF is such a great place, definitely need to figure out a way to keep the diversity
that said, I did agree w/ them that we need to solve rising rents, keep the SF culture, and crack down on landlords booting folks out.

@EXTRINITI not sure how they can be burned they are digital! (seriously tho, i agree and we filed them for defensive purposes, not to divide
@joewardpr not just a number going up, but more about the syndication of content to the social graph through voting
@joewardpr it was defensive, but you have to remember that voting syndicated to friends (pushing more votes) wasn't done at the time.
the most important patent we filed at digg (not yet granted), the "like" button in 2004, linkedin owns it now - https://t.co/26aBhCsRau
