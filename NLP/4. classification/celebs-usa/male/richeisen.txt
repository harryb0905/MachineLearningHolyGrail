Even though it appears he inaccurately judged the Harrison Barnes situation from afar, @KingJames point shouldn‚Äôt be lost: it‚Äôs a business for BOTH management and players and frequently players who end valued relationships are seen as greedy while teams who end it aren‚Äôt.

Couple days removed and still can‚Äôt believe that, in the year of offense, the only redzone snap of #SuperBowl53 led to the only touchdown of the day exactly 53 minutes into the game.

Thirteen months after suffering a crushing overtime championship game defeat to Alabama In Atlanta, @Flyguy2stackz returns to the same building and scores the only touchdown of #superbowl53   Go figure.
Nine punts for Hekker tonight. I‚Äôm wondering if he had nine punts in the first 12 weeks of the season.
Cooper Kupp can be Goff‚Äôs Edelman.
@Buccigross @leebo35 @FauxPelini I could care less. I just tweet what‚Äôs in my head and hit send.
@JimmyTraina This is a great tweet Jimmy.
First touchdown of #SuperBowl53 comes EXACTLY 53 minutes into the game.   That‚Äôs a new record. And also a numerologist‚Äôs dream.
Big advantage in crunch time: crowd dead quiet when Brady has ball.   Deafening when Goff has it.
@jaketapper @Edelman11 @GrittyNHL https://t.co/UFGgAWpqkE
Normally, with 12 minutes to go the choices for #SuperBowl MVP are obvious.   Right now, it‚Äôs @Edelman11 for the Pats.   Have no idea who it would be for the Rams.
Don‚Äôt want to hear another word about punters not being important members of a football team or crucial to winning.   This Super Bowl may just come down to it.
No team shutout in the first half of a Super Bowl has ever gone on to win the game. The combined record of such teams is 0-12.

With the trade of @kporzee, this means Phil Jackson‚Äôs remaining imprint on the Knicks is a high-risk play that the ping pong balls and free agents will bounce right in the Summer or 2019 despite the dreadful reputation and karma of James Dolan.

@NolaProud504 @Whodatfisherman @dfhammill @NFL @MikeFlorioPFT "They" (nor anyone) tell me what to say and never have. The official blew the call. It's the worst non-call ever, as I said on my show and will keep saying. The idea that it was blown because the ref is from SoCal is equally way off. Good day to all!

@AaronTheH Without 280 characters as a construct, I wouldn‚Äôt have tried.
@Jacob_Kemp2 Whose arguing it‚Äôs inexcusable? I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs not.
And after totally BirdBoxing the facemask call on Jared Goff, it had to start dawning on the SoCal refs about all those nasty stares they‚Äôd get from their neighbors while waiting to checkout at Whole Foods or Trader Joe‚Äôs. So when Brees threw towards Lewis, they pounced. #CmonMan
All the refs who supposedly blew the call in the NFC title game because they‚Äôre from SoCal sure took their time cultivating that caper, apparently waiting until the perfect moment with 108 seconds to go to let those Good Vibrations finally overtake their professionalism. #CmonMan
The fact that Wade‚Äôs finger and overall camera work might get much of the attention overshadows a football gathering I‚Äôve never seen in Los Angeles before. Wow. https://t.co/ysJibHTSM4
It‚Äôs not his fault that an official placed with him in the ‚ÄúAll-Star crew‚Äù construct blew it. He can‚Äôt just change it without having been in position himself. https://t.co/12XBgjFCBG

First guest on today‚Äôs @RichEisenShow https://t.co/cWmZJV14KN
Everyone is currently too busy talking about a blatant missed call.   Once that dies down, fact that possible league MVP was left standing around in overtime will begin to gain steam, despite well-founded theory that defense should make a stop. https://t.co/yttupqVUDQ
One last thing: if @tonyromo knows what‚Äôs happening pre-read based on what Brady is seeing, why wouldn‚Äôt the #Chiefs know it too?
October SIXTH, 2007 actually. But that‚Äôs nuts. #SuperBowl53
October 7, 2007  Miami (OH) at Kent State  Wide receiver Sean McVay‚Äôs 3 catches for 37 yards help the RedHawks overcome a 260-yard passing, 92-yard rushing performance by Golden Flashes QB Julian @Edelman11 https://t.co/9YIpA8J3a2
My nephew Jack is one of those such @patriots fans, born in Mass. on January 20, 2002. Happy 17th birthday, Jack! Quite a way to celebrate today. https://t.co/Eu4nv27Bpq
The @RamsNFL won their only Super Bowl opening the first new #Falcons stadium in Atlanta.   Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl against the Rams.   Something‚Äôs gotta repeat.
That‚Äôs now NINE Super Bowl appearances for Tom Brady, who has been at it so long he will try and win it all against the same franchise before and after relocation.
I‚Äôm a Tails Never Fails guy but it should be noted that both overtime winners made the Super Bowl today calling Heads for the overtime toss.
And Mahomes never touched the ball.
Good one TJ https://t.co/7HgDPyc05n
This is the first Championship Sunday with two overtime games. #ExtraFootball
They better throw it in the end zone.
Mahomes is truly spectacular. These throws with just one time out. Take a shot to win. Why not?
Re-upping your parentheses can be hazardous, but in this case.... https://t.co/807Oz9U9b9
Ro-mostradamus
I think an unsuspecting Arrowhead patron in the first row just received a new Microsoft Surface tablet c/o Bill Belichick.
Great drive by Mahomes.   (but they may have scored too soon)
Brady, Gronk, a rookie, a Bills castoff and a Bengals castoff just combined to put the #Patriots up in the AFC Championship Game with 3:32 to go.
And what a catch.
That‚Äôs a catch by Hogan.
Andy Reid with the play call https://t.co/0Ea937TTj9
Dee Ford flashing in front of Edelman created that tipped ball. Great defensive play all around. Another intense finish on the way.
I don‚Äôt think he touched it.   But you can‚Äôt tell for 100 percent certain if the ball didn‚Äôt graze his right thumb.   I think this stands as called. And, watching live, it sure looked like Edelman touched the ball.
The last team to trail Tom Brady and the #Patriots by 10 entering the fourth quarter and come back to win as these #Chiefs are trying to do: the 2012 Seahawks in the famed ‚ÄúYou Mad, Bro?‚Äù game. https://t.co/LfY0Zr7VWP
Saints fans are envious of that flag.
It‚Äôs inevitable. https://t.co/B0F2ol8In0
That‚Äôs exactly the start the #Chiefs needed: a WOW play from Mahomes to move the chains, get the crowd going and lead to a crucial score to @tkelce
What a throw.
@williamhoup Will, how many folks give Wentz credit for that NFC Championship Game win last year? Super Bowl win?  So many that there‚Äôs a significant argument in the league as to whether Wentz is now expendable?  (Lol.)
@PatMcAfeeShow Or jinx.
That‚Äôs a üêê throw. Or rather, the latest üêê throw by the üêê to cap a 90-yard drive. Whatever the feels-like temp is in Arrowhead now feels that much colder.
It took a quarter and a half, but here comes @PatrickMahomes5
@mattlenow @RamsNFL @TG3II @AaronDonald97 I declare no winner.   Im just recalling few people at the time thought the Rams made the right choice.   And fact is: Goff is going to beat Wentz to the Super Bowl start.
Congrats to Les Snead, the @RamsNFL GM who, among other items:  With team prez Kevin Demoff, hired a 30-year-old Mcvay ‚úÖ  Drafted Goff over Wentz ‚úÖ  Drafted @TG3II and @AaronDonald97 and found a way to happily pay both and still build an NFC Champion   And more.
Well that was quite the O. Brady like twist to that plot.
That‚Äôs a 15-play, 80-yard touchdown drive in 8:05 to start the AFC Championship Game.   The #Patriots started their Divisional Round win over #Chargers with a 14-play, 83-yard, 7:11 touchdown drive.  First 15 scripted: üëçüèª
Wonder if we will see a new movement towards what I‚Äôve been advocating for years: let everything be challenged. Everything.   Keep the number of challenges the same. Or give one more.   And let it all be challengeable.
That was quick. https://t.co/iyDvFLb9Xw
List of first overall drafted quarterbacks to start a Super Bowl:   Terry Bradshaw Jim Plunkett @johnelway @TroyAikman @DrewBledsoe Peyton Manning Eli Manning @CameronNewton  Jared Goff   The first-ever one just interviewed the latest. https://t.co/DSgD9Un3yR
The impending admission from the league officiating office that the officials bird-boxed that clear penalty in the last two minutes will be a particularly bitter pill to swallow in New Orleans.   Nevertheless, congrats to the #Saints on a great season.
There‚Äôs a Los Angeles team in the Super Bowl.
Wow. A field goal now wins it for the @ramsnfl
@Dr_Brian_Fever That‚Äôs a timing device for the silent snap count. Every team does something like it on the road.
Zuerline. Serpentine. https://t.co/EBLF1JiViG
Don‚Äôt blame @SeanPayton one bit for continuing to chirp at these refs.
Only whistle not being swallowed apparently is in the stands.
Oh my goodness. Horrible no-call. Dreadful defensive play. As @TroyAikman pointed out, should have been a pick.   And now #Rams have 1:41 to tie or win. Instead of a walkoff FG for #Saints
That incompletion is HUGE. Wow.
The decision to tie rather than go for the lead combined with that huge vertical connection by Brees now allows Saints to take clock down to a minute, kick a FG and give Goff that much time and no timeouts left to tie. Or win.
McVay not going for it there is like a coffee freak suddenly ordering decaf.
The 4th quarter will start with a monster 3rd and long for New Orleans.
@WhitlockJason Also, to prevent big package being brought in on d.
@WhitlockJason Crowd noise. At its lowest after a huge gash play like that.
Hell of a response by #Rams. What a game. #NFCChampionship
And a crushing 3-and-out on the other side of halftime leading to a Saints look TD drive takes the momentum right out of a Rams helmet and into a fleur-de-lis
I think there‚Äôs a pre-snap penalty on every play. https://t.co/mbOABuImeG
What a dime by Goff and a huge score before halftime especially to give Gurley a lift after an especially difficult start.
Huge sequence here especially with #Rams getting ball to start the next half.
In case of emergency, turn to your punter. #PuntersAreGameChangersToo  #ForTheBrand
Huge play. Fake punt turned tide in that building last week. Let‚Äôs see what happens here.

Never thought I'd say this, but Sean McVay needs to channel his inner Kotite today. Yes, the last visiting coach to win a playoff game in the Superdome: Rich Kotite and the Eagles, who scored 26 4th quarter points vs. Jim Mora's #Saints in the 1992 Wild Card round.
@andrewperloff Except the Miami Miracle actually happened and the hypothetical makes sense that it put New England on a plane this weekend. The Rams were never hosting the Saints this year with no guarantee of a different result even if they had. So....huh?

Love watching this @umichbball team. 17-0 first time ever. #GoBlue
Since everyone is proposing off-the-wall ideas for the #Eagles Wentz-Foles decision: how about they keep them both, but start Wentz only until Week 15. And then let Foles do the rest. #WhatWorks
@jwgop I think one GOAT and one pup will win. I need time to ponder.
+1 https://t.co/fvUoXujUAD
We feel you. https://t.co/FexOw1BRnp
What a run by the #Eagles and Nick Foles, quite a thrill.     But there will be a new Super Bowl champion with the 2004 Patriots the last team to repeat.   The 14 seasons without a repeat champion is by far the longest such stretch in Super Bowl history.
For the first time ever, the top four scoring offenses will be represented in a single Championship Weekend. #Patriots #Chiefs #Rams #Saints
Alshon still can‚Äôt believe it.   Doug Pederson and Foles consoling him is what being a coach and teammate is all about.
BREAKING: Will Lutz has been offered a spot on @TODAYshow next week in case the #Eagles come back.
Leblanc is balling. https://t.co/Y1UOjVjCZy
The #Eagles know that falling behind at home 14-0 as the 1-seed isn‚Äôt the end of things. They came back from that deficit as the 1-seed in 2003. It‚Äôs also happened twice since with the home team also coming back to win in New England 4 years ago. #Saints trying to make it 3-of-4 https://t.co/yU9tGZljbg
This should be Saints ball on FOURTH down.
In case you‚Äôre wondering, it‚Äôs been 10 seasons since Drew Brees threw a pick on the #Saints first play of the game.   It did not bode well for the final result.
Well then. https://t.co/oKG4hmFdyP
Quarterback bolognese. https://t.co/j5oLadKXmT
St. Nick still coming down the playoff chimney.
Holy cow. What a start.   Inserts doubt. Quiets crowd.   Essentially, the #Eagles will start both halves with the ball. Almost as if they received to start game and for a touchback.
@chrisbrockman @kgo5013 Spot on correct. Except for the incessant doubting over a two-month period.
The #Chargers close out the game on a 14-0 run. Which is good in basketball.
The last AFC Championship Game to not involve the #Patriots was the Jets at Steelers in the 2010 season.
@andrewperloff Come on.
@KeithOlbermann Huh?
@OsheaJacksonJr Roman Numeral humor is so rare.
In order to play the Super Bowl, shouldn‚Äôt Maroon 5 have to change their name to Maroon V?
In his first half of NFL postseason action, @patriots Sony Michel @Flyguy2stackz became the first rookie running back to run for 3 touchdowns in a playoff half in the Super Bowl Era. Nice start.
Misleading Stat of the Day: Philip Rivers matched Tom Brady with one TD pass in the first half.
The league‚Äôs so-called most complete team is being deleted. https://t.co/p0T205hU71
Just when the Chargers get a stop and a chance to score on either side of halftime and utilize their only path to get back in it....  This is gonna be a turnover and a wrap.
If the #Patriots are going to equip him with a run game and defenses are going to allow him to build and sustain drives by throwing almost everything underneath coverage, Tom Brady is going to play forever.
So, the #Patriots are so vulnerable and the dynasty nearing such an end that they just opened a playoff game with 3 straight touchdowns for the first time ever.
The number of #Patriots first-quarter first downs matches Tom Brady‚Äôs uniform number: 12
To paraphrase a famous Boston sports quote: Lamar Jackson and that #Ravens offense is not walking through that door today.
What a response by the #Chargers   Game on.
Just your run-of-the-mill, Divisional Round game-opening 14-play, 83 yard, 7-minute touchdown drive for the #Patriots   Remarkly, first playoff game opening TD drive in their last 8 playoff games.

The two teams that supposedly signaled the demise of defense in the Week 11 Monday Nighter in LA both won a Divisional Playoff game yesterday with 0 touchdown passes.   (They also still both scored at least 30.)
It‚Äôs Divisional Playoff Sunday, people.
Love this. https://t.co/DIBMmLwL9s
Zero sacks 273 yards rushing  All against the most dangerous front 7a in the league last few weeks.  Raise a glass to the @RamsNFL offensive line.
If this was the regular season, half my timeline would be fantasy owners of @TG3II losing their minds over CJ Anderson vulturing his touchdowns.   Not a concern in the playoffs.
@ricksavage @kyledunnigan Oh I saw.
Big defensive stop.
Going for two, going for it on 4th down, Jason Garrett is suddenly as aggressive as pre-Chantix Liotta.
On another note, what an absolute next-level dart on the run tossed by @dak
McVay just tossed a challenge flag trusting his players on top of the play telling him he should challenge that it was no catch.   But, that‚Äôs a catch.
The @RamsNFL are gashing the Cowboys on the ground one week after it was widely believed the #Seahawks lost to Dallas because they didn't abandon the run soon enough.   And Seattle had the top rushing offense in 2018.

Heck of a throw on the run by Goff.  Unfortunately, that's not going to count.
@SheaInIrving @bomani_jones https://t.co/cBb4w0P5IH
@bomani_jones Thought the same.  Since when did he become such a load?
Interesting that the Rams start in grind-it-out mode while the Cowboys start with the quick strike. #RoleReversal
One play after rolling the dice at midfield, Jason Garrett rewarded with a brilliant run to the endzone by Amari Cooper, whose acquisition has gone from laughing stock to bargain in half a season.
@RattoIndy In the running for title of my memoir.
Only a FG, but a stellar opening drive for the @RamsNFL offensive line against a front 7 that has been throwing their weight around at will for 2 months straight.
With his 126 yards, Damian Williams @DwillOne7 became just the 4th running back in #Chiefs playoff history with a 100-yard game and the first since Priest Holmes ran for 176 yards in the 2003 Wildcard round also against the #Colts
Congrats to @SNFonNBC to another great season with Al and @CollinsworthPFF and the crew.
Prior to the game, if you had told me that the #Colts would only give up 7 second half points and Mahomes would have no TD passes, I‚Äôd have thought that‚Äôs a recipe for upset. Instead, the #Chiefs win by 18 thanks to their solidified D.
The #Chargers won in the Wild Card round last week without a single TD pass and, remarkably, even with the 50-TD passer in @PatrickMahomes5, the #Chiefs just won a Divisional game the same way.   Last time that happened in the same postseason: 1993
The Kansas City #Chiefs will host an AFC Championship Game for the first time next week and attempt to raise the Hunt Trophy in the stadium made possible by its namesake.
@WarrenSapp I saw that sack dance too

@SheaInIrving @chrisbrockman He's not scared because he knows the coach is getting a contract extension no matter the result, Chris.
@Thebigirish73 @ESanders_10 @AB84 The owner has already said it's hard to envision him being back, meaning he has addressed the cap hit. Also, the cap savings they will have without him help on the back end. That said, it's a tough hit to swallow but it's possible.

@SportsWithMoore It's a legit question, Matt.   I'd have carried the Vikings into that game seeing the way the Eagles were playing.
Did I just see Winterfell handed off to Khaleesi?
And, in terms of single team point totals, the Cowboys 24 points topping a Wildcard Weekend for most points is tied for third fewest in the playoff round since 1978. https://t.co/tWE3xppDBE
Just 7 weeks after the #Chiefs #Rams MNF game allegedly signaled the end of defense, this  Wildcard Weekend ranked 6th in the now 30 Wildcard Weekends in the current playoff format in terms of fewest total points scored with 145 points, an average of 18.1 points per team.
@JOEL9ONE @mikefreemanNFL Yep. Wow.
One must wonder if the #Bears, in a very quiet moment in the coming days, might spend time regretting their Week 17 win over the Vikings.
The champs still alive and now head to New Orleans. That is insane.
And cross bar. You have GOT to be kidding.
Holy upright, Batman.
What a throw by Trubisky. Throw of his life.
Cody Parkey spent some time in Chicago this year as Public Enemy No 1.   Oh. Boy.   Here we go.
What a finish. What a replay. I think it‚Äôs gotta stand.
Incredible drive by Foles, Pederson and the #Eagles all set up by a huge defensive stop by the defense. Still work left to go. But that‚Äôs championship stuff.
Golden Tate!!!
Run the Philly Special.
Best LeBlanc performance on NBC in years! https://t.co/4ProCDUV4m
So a catch, fumble and unrecovered ball that‚Äôs initially called an incompletion after further review is...an incompletion?  Is that in the rulebook? @MikePereira ?  Great question by Al to wonder if that was made up out of whole cloth.
@michaelirvin88 @Chargers @Ravens @NFL Says the only guy who took the Texans yesterday.
It will be #Chargers #Patriots for the right to play winner of #Colts #Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game.
And that will do it.
Now down to 66 yards. Unreal.
One play too late. Gates wanted it!
Now run it.
One more Rivers to Gates ends it. Gotta try it.
That‚Äôs two.
If that‚Äôs a touchdown, it‚Äôs possible you set clock before 2 minute warning which would be a huge factor in Baltimore getting the ball back. I do think Harbaugh would have to challenge and run risk of burning another time out. Lots happening here.
Is that a touchdown?
Wow. No, no, no, no. Yes.
That‚Äôs one.
In order to win, the #Ravens need as many touchdowns in 9 minutes as first downs they‚Äôve amassed through the first 51.   Three.
Flacco seeming to give Lamar tips is something to commend.   One hopes a veteran would do it, but not everyone is Mr. Chips when it comes to helping a rookie taking your job and packing your family up.
Note to anyone playing the #Chargers, especially a #Patriots team that looks to be next: cover Mike Williams @darealmike_dub on a 2-point conversion. https://t.co/TMnoihgJGe
This may be a player down by contact.  This may be a touchdown.  Regardless.  Dear playoff refs:  Swallow your damn whistles.  Respectfully, Everyone
Time to give @NickSwisher a more prominent gig. https://t.co/Mh5ulP65bf
Exactly what the #Ravens needed....short of the defense running it in themselves for points.
The way I interpret John Harbaugh declining to answer @tracywolfson question is that Lamar is currently playing for his right to keep playing in this game. And if he plays well and wins, Harbaugh doesn't want it on record going into NE that he was considering pulling Lamar.
This is....not good. https://t.co/WR8x9S6FJV
@KevinWade55 @RiddickTNT Ann Arbor math curriculum is actually accurate. But that was a good one!
Silver lining in Baltimore: for a team with an offense that has so far predominantly been a giveaway machine, the #Ravens being down 9 with the ball isn't that bad.
Because it just means more to the SEC when the B1G Champ gets left out two years in a row. https://t.co/nNELP5FBcm

@RobChristie1 @Lj_era8 They did. Lamar began starting midseason. Don't be so quick to troll!
He never did it at Louisville, so unless he did it in Pop Warner or Boynton Beach High School, today will be the first time @Lj_era8 has EVER faced an opponent for the second time in the same season.
@raymerrill @NFLGameDay @nflnetwork "Remember when before he won the Masters..." is how the analogy starts on the video.
@Martello16 @NFLGameDay @nflnetwork @PhilMickelson But as I said...it's like it USED to be with Phil.
@tbutler05 @NFLGameDay Nice pic!!! #GoBlue
Just aired a wonderful feature on the 1988 Fog Bowl playoff game between the #Bears and #Eagles which featured a remarkable NFL playoff record stat line for Randall Cunningham, most passing yards without a TD: 407 yards
@DVNJr That's the worst Hamilton song ever, Don.
The last #Bears quarterback to throw a pass in Soldier Field in a playoff game was Caleb Hanie, who somehow almost beat the #Packers in place of an injured Jay Cutler in the 2010 NFC Championship Game.  Now, here comes Trubisky.
We will either get the #Cowboys and #Saints in their first-ever playoff meeting (yep, it's never happened) or the first #Cowboys #Rams playoff matchup at @lacoliseum since the 1978 NFC Championship Game.
When a team gets remarkable production from their young QB and deadline-acquired WR + gets the most out of a lightning fast play-making defense to a win division &amp; playoff game, the HC and GM usually get much credit.   But not the #Cowboys   Congrats, Jason Garrett &amp; Jerry Jones.
It‚Äôs Wildcard Sunday, people.
For the first time in 7 playoff seasons with @DangeRussWilson the #Seahawks are one-and-done, ending a remarkable run of success.
The @dallascowboys get only their 3rd playoff win since 1996 as @Dak becomes the first #Cowboys quarterback ever to have a rushing and passing touchdown in the same playoff game.
This #Seahawks #Cowboys game is the first playoff game in which both QBs have a rushing and passing TD since Rich Gannon and Steve McNair did it in the 2002 AFC Championship Game @NFLResearch
@MichaelCastFS Indeed it has.
What a play by Wright. Holy üí©
This Cooper play:  2018: a catch 2017: not a catch   One executive who pushed greatly to make this possible is @dallascowboys Competition Committee member Stephen Jones.
@DGarrM @JasonLaCanfora He is not.
It is allowed for a team from Seattle to pass on first down, right @MikePereira?
@JasonLaCanfora Come on.
Nope. This is most wide-open NFL playoff field I‚Äôve covered in my now 16 seasons with @nflnetwork   Anyone can take it. https://t.co/JbzS7baXtm

@TheIndieHandbk Many, many thanks

And, believe it or not, the 2004 Big Ben is the ONLY rookie QB the @patriots have faced in the playoffs in the Brady/Belichick Era.
The @patriots will either next face a rookie or a 15-year vet at QB. Last time they faced one of those in the playoffs?  Vet: Peyton Manning, 18th season, 2015 AFC Championship Game  Rookie: Ben Roethlisberger, 2004 AFC Championship Game
If I‚Äôm Seattle, I‚Äôm moving Wilson out of the pocket and not dropping him back. And I would run it straight ahead, immediately discarding all running plays where the first step is lateral.
There have only been three 1-5 teams in the Super Bowl era to make the playoffs ‚Äî the 1970 #Bengals, the 2015 #Chiefs and these #Colts  The previous two made it to the Divisional Round but no further.   The 2018 #Chiefs would like to keep it that way.
Since starting the season 1-5, the #Colts have lost only once ‚Äî in Week 13 to, remarkably, Jacksonville, which, remarkably, shut them out.   Now it‚Äôs on to Kansas City.
@DanyelReneeBB Nicely played
@KenTremendous Good lord what is that from?? https://t.co/ogJG4LBJNc
Get ready for @adamvinatieri to make it a 4-possession game.
They‚Äôve got to face somebody and a red hot Colts team, a Chargers team that knows them well and just beat them in KC in Week 15 or a Ravens team that almost beat them in KC in Week 14 are the candidates. https://t.co/i2uA0Udxzp
As bad as this is and looks, the #Texans have a way back: score touchdowns on either side of halftime, starting with this drive.
Anyone else recall another instance of a team fixing their major problem of protecting a quarterback as quickly and effectively as these #Colts have with Luck?
Andrew Luck has been able to make himself a sandwich and serve it up every single drop back.
@gregbradyTO Has he ever trailed by 3 TDs?
@gregbradyTO I stand corrected
It‚Äôs @JJWatt to the rescue again, making a clutch play against an All-Pro opponent when his team absolutely needed it. How many times have the #Texans seen that?
First quarter #Colts: 2 touchdowns  #Texans: 2 first downs
@chrisbrockman Ok. Feel free to up the pace.
It took all of 10 minutes into his first #NFL playoff game for DeShaun Watson to trail by more than a touchdown for the first time since high school.
@chrisbrockman Pace yourself.
75 yards on first drive, 63 to @TYHilton13

The last two times the #Browns made the playoffs in '02 and '94, they finished behind the #Steelers in division.  So, one can arguably say this is the first time since 1989 that you'd be prone to take the #Browns future over the #Steelers

For the first time in 5 years and for only the 4th time in the 12-year tenure of Mike Tomlin, the #Steelers miss the playoffs.   For all the haters: Tomlin‚Äôs Steelers have never suffered a losing season.
The #Colts began the off-season by having their new HC ghost on them, then began the season with Andrew Luck‚Äôs viability in question only to lose 5 of their first 6.   They‚Äôre now only the third team in the Super Bowl Era to make the playoffs after a 1-5 start.   Remarkable. https://t.co/PKH5QxLBeq
In this game of Who Wants To Be A Six-Seed, the #Titans just phoned a friend in @KingHenry_2 and the #Steelers are in sight of using their 50/50.
First ballot @ProFootballHOF üêê @adamvinatieri   Do not even think of @-ing me
Oh, Adoree.
@mlombardiNFL You mean telling the Jets that Idzik was their man isn‚Äôt at the top of the Korn-Ferry recruitment video?
Your Wildcard Weekend schedule:  #Titans/#Colts/#Steelers at #Texans, Saturday 4:35pm ET ESPN/ABC #Seahawks at #Cowboys Saturday 8:15pm ET FOX #Chargers at #Ravens, Sunday 1pm ET CBS #Eagles at #Bears, Sunday 4:40pm ET NBC
The Chargers win 12 games and all it earns them is a trip east to play in an early Sunday window in the cold weather against the No. 1 ranked defense, a dreadful assignment for a West Coast team.
Why does any NFL team need the help of a headhunting search firm to hire the right coach? It‚Äôs not like a team in need of a coach just got dropped into the league from another industry. Or another country.
Todd Bowles is a good man and, from Elizabeth NJ, it would‚Äôve been a great story had he been the one to take the @nyjets to the promised land.   Alas, it was not to be. Like everyone else since Weeb Ewbank.  That‚Äôs now 15 straight Lombardi-less head coaches.
@metheridge @Chiefs @ChiefsReporter @NFL @gmfb @DanPatrick @ArrowheadPride @DavidKoechner @leighkoechner That‚Äôs not a metaphor for anything, is it?
Andrew Luck, what an opening drive and finish.
@hughhewitt @Lj_era8 @DangeRussWilson @bakermayfield @nflcommish @NFLOfficiating @Browns @Ravens I think (and hope) you‚Äôll see better officiating in the playoffs Hugh.
NostraRichus https://t.co/2RbCEpCa8s
At this point last year, many didn‚Äôt think @Lj_era8 was a first-round pick and yet he‚Äôs the only QB from the 2018 rookie class in the playoffs, earning it with a 6-1 record.   He will try to become the first rookie QB to win a playoff game since @DangeRussWilson in 2012.
At this point last year, nobody thought @bakermayfield was a 1st overall pick &amp; he not only set a rookie record for TD passes, but set a new standard for waking up while awakening a whole town. That‚Äôs what a 1st overall pick should do. Congrats to the #Browns‚Å† ‚Å† and their fans
On the clock, officially. Your Top 10 order in 2019. https://t.co/aDVw3Ma1s3
The @Steelers are now in the unenviable position of rooting for a tie in Game 256. If that happens, they‚Äôre the 6-seed heading to Houston. If not, they‚Äôre out. And taking stock in a frustrating season.
Can‚Äôt say enough about the #Ravens who completely recast themselves around @Lj_era8 to win 6 of their last 7 to win the North. Rematch of the Week 16 Saturday Ravens-Chargers game coming in Wildcard Weekend, this time in Baltimore.
What an incredible finish In Baltimore. Congrats to the @ravens on winning the AFC North. Sorry to all my #steelers friends. And #Browns fans, congrats. Your future requires shades to look at.
This review taking too long. Stick with the call or not.
Baker is balling. His receivers are balling. This game is balling.   The Ravens can‚Äôt have another Ohio QB knock them out and put another team in with another last-second Week 17 comeback in their house AGAIN.   Can they?
The greatness of @tonyromo is that he is all of us watching the game he‚Äôs calling, except he knows so much more than us but doesn‚Äôt wear that on his sleeve.
Here we go, the Ravens and Steelers seasons in the hands of @bakermayfield
The #Bears make many QBs look bad, but Kirk Cousins day perfectly captured his first season in Minnesota: a complete, utter disappointment.
So @bakermayfield sets the record for most TD passes by a rookie (despite not being deemed ready for the first 3 starts of the season) and now it‚Äôs a 2 point game with ball in @Lj_era8 court and hands.   First of many Baker v. Lamar games is delivering.
@jaketapper Quite, Jake. Quite.
The defending Super Bowl Champion #Eagles 2018 season https://t.co/0iMCTLBsgo
The defending World Champs ended the season with 3 straight wins and 5 wins in their last 6 and, barring a Kirk Cousins two TD comeback on the toughest defense in the NFC, will indeed, remarkably, have a chance to defend their title.
By not challenging that clearly misspotted ball, Gregg Williams may have just cost himself a chance to not have to interview for a job in person.
Vikings on brink as Bears take an 11-point lead while the Eagles about to close out the Skins, up 24 in DC
Chad Henne now comes in to light it up for KC, just to give hot takers on sports morning shows the chance to call Mahomes ‚Äúa system quarterback‚Äù for clicks and attention.
Man, @bakermayfield throws a very nice deep ball. Gives his guy a chance almost every time on the 50/50 too.
Suddenly momentum for the 6-seed in the NFC is wearing a purple shirt while the Steelers tie it up hoping for a Browns season-ending comeback with one quarter to go.
The remarkable @PatrickMahomes5 just threw his 50th touchdown pass of the season.
Entirely possible. I think the Cowboys in a night game as centerpiece to weekend might be too tempting to pass up. https://t.co/tszSF0Xr6t
@JBFlint It‚Äôs my prediction Joe.
My way-too-early, halftime of late Sunday Week 17 prediction for Wildcard Weekend:  Saturday  Colts/Titans at Texans, 430pET ESPN  Seahawks at Cowboys, 8pm NBC  Sunday:   Eagles/Vikings at Bears, 1pm ET FOX  Chargers at Steelers/Ravens, 425pm ET CBS
And a 93-yard takeaway by Jarvis Landry and his helmet. Unbelievable sequence there.
That‚Äôs a huge 93-yard takeaway by the officials in Baltimore.
@BearGator Cleveland would get the ball, but at spot of recovery.
This appears to be a fumble and a hosed Browns defensive TD. Wow.
Trouble for #Vikings: down 13, they just picked up their 1st first-down of the game with 5:28 to go in the half as #Eagles just took a 10-0 lead before halftime, after which they get the ball first.
Know this is stating an obvious but I fear the #Bears have a place kicking issue entering the playoffs.
The @Chiefs up 21-0 which means it sure looks like the AFC playoffs will go through Arrowhead, creating an AFC South Wildcard game by sending tonight‚Äôs winner to Houston next weekend and the Chargers to the AFC North winner.
Brotherhood. https://t.co/Qt9mHYemlR
Mark this moment: @Lj_era8 scores his second touchdown of the day to give #Ravens a 10-point lead as Big Ben throws a Pick Six to fall down 7-0 in second quarter.
Hard-nosed power football by #Ravens   Folks in Baltimore have to love this.
The @RamsNFL jump out to early 14-0 lead meaning #Vikings scoreboard operator has one job: run as many highlights for Matt Nagy to see on the #Bears sideline.
I knew @MikeMayock joining Twitter would pay off. https://t.co/2XE0B6SJCQ
The #Jets and #Giants combine to go 9-23 this season.   I hope Ray Liotta isn‚Äôt a New York football fan because it‚Äôs enough to make him pick up smoking again.
I know I‚Äôm not in football shape, but I‚Äôm from California and it took me two days to get used to London time and almost a whole week on the return to feel myself and I went to just call an NFL a game.   Have no idea how this could work for #Raiders  https://t.co/Veq8FlGOVd
What a grab by @Bease11   That is gonna come out of replay with a TD.
The last two plays of the Todd Bowles Era for @nyjets was a fumble and a victory formation for the #Patriots to earn them a 9th straight first-round bye.   Sadly says it all.
The @HoustonTexans are AFC South champions, most likely to host #Colts or #Titans in next week‚Äôs Wildcard Weekend.   And if this is indeed the end, Blake Bortles final pass for the #Jaguars was an interception for a touchback.
Despite all the hand-wringing by many, @patriots have clinched a bye-week in the playoffs, one home win away from an EIGHTH straight AFC Championship Game appearance.
@DaveWallsWSET @PrescottRossi Thank you for that
Wow, @saquon just damn near went @Jumpman23 from the 4-yard line.
No filter. https://t.co/mitTyokSyc
Kiko Alonso sure is involved in an inordinate amount of hits involving sliding quarterbacks.
A 68-yard run puts @saquon above 2,000 yards from scrimmage, joining @ProFootballHOF @EricDickerson and Edgerrin James as the only rookies to do it.
The number of keepers @deshaunwatson is having and the hits he is taking in this game with a playoff game coming up in a week is downright, well, insane.   I don‚Äôt understand it at all.
That‚Äôs 3 TDs now for Blake Jarwin, something not even the great @JasonWitten did for @dallascowboys   He better get a call, @DeionSanders
Sam Darnold is special and deserves so much better. Hopefully he shall receive it.
Teams with 0 first half points and a deficit of (at least) two scores: Giants, Saints, Packers, Dolphins, Falcons.   Teams with 3 first half points and a deficit of (at least) two scores: Jets and Jaguars.   Late games can‚Äôt arrive soon enough.
Aaron Rodgers strolls off the field flanked by trainers with the #Packers down 14. It appears his 2018 is over.
The football gods saw fit to give us a kicker throwing a touchdown pass with @PatMcAfeeShow in the booth.

While four of the six playoff spots have been clinched in the AFC, not a single seed is locked in. The current makeup of the playoff seeding can be completely reconstituted by tonight. In fact, there's a 6.3% chance of that.
@BGFan01 We outsource that stuff...would never denigrate an intern!
Just got to my desk position and found all 128 (!) non-tie Week 17 AFC playoff possibilities printed out barcode style on a single Ben McAdoo sized piece of 11x17 card stock by @NFLResearch @RealJackAndrade https://t.co/4Ai7lLMXqL
It‚Äôs Week 17, people.
In beating Oklahoma and likely sending Kyler Murray to the Major Leagues with more touchdowns than incompletions, Tua appears to have sent a message to a particular Heisman Trustee https://t.co/yGw30ddfer
@TheCincyBuckeye @chrisfallica A one-loss Michigan would've had an only loss to an undefeated ND team on the road, not Purdue on the road.  And in a system where only four make it, a loss like the one to Purdue disqualifies an Ohio St team that should have a shot at the title anyway.
That Josh Jacobs punking is what one might call an exclamation point.
@chrisfallica Faleeks, why can‚Äôt we all agree that while Ohio State and Georgia didn‚Äôt deserve to make a final foursome they would have made a final 8 and could‚Äôve gone on a run to give Clemson and Alabama far better games than what we are seeing today from ND and OU?
Failed fourth down attempt from midfield down 21 before the first quarter gun is pretty much the nightmare scenario for how this game could start for Oklahoma.
That's an NFL catch, including the two feet. And that, right there, was an NFL throw.
Not a fumble.
Ruling on field is fumble. Can't see much to overturn. Kirk noticed elbow down, but can't tell if ball is already out. Looked to me it was.
@ChantelJennings was thinking the same exact thing.
@dondonahue Don, the point is...if this team is dominating a college football playoff semi and, under the current system, may not have made it due to a result in late September...then the system needs to change so a team like Clemson can make it regardless...like say Georgia or OSU this year
Here‚Äôs the #CFBPlayoff fix I forwarded a few weeks ago.   https://t.co/zRhhg5Xz9f
Typical response! C'mon Ralph!  On my show, I posited a format for an 8-team playoff and created an 8-team field this year that included Notre Dame but left Michigan out.  Sorry your team got torched tonight! https://t.co/v9qQ7d2J5W
I think because Clemson players chased Dabo onto the field, it looks like Brian Kelly just got a Gatorade bath in a loss.
If #NFL teams have an interest in Lincoln Riley as head coach, imagine if, 4 quarters from now, his @OU_Football team beats the most pro-style program with arguably the most pro-ready players.
Courage.  Thanks, Dan. https://t.co/dRh2BpdU1l
Fact that announcers are filling time of a 30-3 Clemson beatdown of ND in playoff semi by wondering if Clemson would have made the #CFBplayoff at all had they not come back against Syracuse in late September is latest Exhibit A on why current format is absurd.
Uh, yeah. https://t.co/oUURmkxXqR

@RattoNBCS Committed to pride-playing.
If the #Steelers lose and the #Colts win today, the Week 17 contest in Tennessee between the Colts and #Titans would be a win-and-in, loser-goes-home defacto playoff game.  And the only way Pittsburgh gets in would be if they beat #Bengals and the #Ravens lose to the #Browns
It‚Äôs quite simple: @PatrickMahomes5 successfully negotiates the 12s and @Seahawks in @CenturyLink tonight on @SNFonNBC he‚Äôs your 2018 @NFL MVP   The #Chiefs would also be AFC West champs with a bye week.
Based on Saturday's results:  The #Dolphins are eliminated with a loss at home to the #Jaguars.   The #Redskins are out if the #Eagles win, but if the Eagles lose, they're out if the #Vikings win in Detroit.   The #Panthers are out if they lose.
@DanHanzus @G3ntl3H4ze Thank you, Dan Hanzus.
It appears nothing riles up the base quite like caping for Eli.
And I‚Äôm not saying Philip deserves criticism. The #Ravens D dominated the line and the secondary performed well.   I‚Äôm just saying those things rarely get pointed out to Eli‚Äôs benefit.
Philip tonight: 23 of 37, 181 yards, 0 TD, 2 INTs and 4 sacks. If Eli had stat line in a game like this, he gets savaged. #JustSayin
What a huge win in LA for the #Ravens who become #Sainrs fans tomorrow against Pittsburgh.   Entirely feasible scenario ‚Äî rematch of this game Wildcard Weekend in Baltimore.
Huge drive stopped by a huge sack leading to a huge special teams play on punt. Exciting, all-phase action in playoff-like contest.
Hell of a drive by Philip here, taking hits, stepping up, making 3rd down throws to move chains.

Jeremy Sprinkle sounds like someone who grew up on Jeremy Street with a dog named Sprinkle.
Both #Redskins and #Titans have a Week 17 home date with the teams directly in front of them in the standings, #Eagles #Colts respectively.  Makes the game about to kick on @nflnetwork between the two that much bigger.

@molly_knight Hello from Dylan and Halo! https://t.co/GnZ0eMNgNl
@Michael_Fabiano @AmberTheoharis @lindsay_rhodes Why aren‚Äôt you screen-grabbing something from your game in the @AliceInChains league, Fabs?
@sportnewsed My rage has always been there, Birch. Not in general. Just on this. And people taking their shoes off on a plane.
@DerrickJKraft Just pulled out of thin air!
And the #Saints  just won. In order to force them to pack another bag before the Super Bowl, they have to lose out and Rams win out.   Looks like the NFC road to Super Bowl 53 goes through New Orleans.
After Week 9, the #Panthers were viewed as a legit contender and threat to the #Saints  They haven‚Äôt won since Week 9.  And they have a proud defense, a tremendous running back, a one-time MVP QB and a two-time Coach of the Year.   #GoFigure
I want it ruled as spotted at the point of the fumble or back at the 20 for a reverse touchback. https://t.co/1AdEbJmvMh
And, in this instance, you can‚Äôt tell if it really went into the end zone or to the side of the pylon. Naked eye or replay.
I absolutely abhor the rule that a fumble into the end zone is a touchback. If it‚Äôs fumbled one inch in front of the pylon, the ball is spotted there. If it‚Äôs fumbled two inches further, it‚Äôs a touchback?
Well that was quite a sequence.
Serious pad popping and paint swapping in tonight‚Äôs game.
@MichaelHopcraft @nflnetwork2 Bro.
@keoshascouch @RichEisenShow @DeionSanders You had me at Dolan Wormhole
Come on.  Awful pick.  Great play by Apple, perhaps biggest of his career to date.
Ten seconds lost by giving a first-down signal but why didn't someone else didn't call a timeout for Cam. What was that???
@guardoverseas I've noticed. If Thomas has a zero night, I'm going to lose my fantasy playoff.
@mhbeaton Shots aren't fired. I said they had a good discussion, but missed a good follow up and I'm asking if anyone knows who Brees was gesturing to
MNF crew just had a good chat about the Saints WR corps looking for a viable No. 2 and, one snap later, had a great chance to follow up when Brees gestured at someone for not coming back for the ball.  Instead they discussed redzone defense.  Who didn't come back for Brees?
With their last two games at home, it's possible that if the #Saints win tonight it'll be the last time they pack their bags until the Super Bowl. Or bust.
That rare moment in time when your lead running back is also your passing leader. That guy ‚Å¶@run__cmc‚Å© is something else. https://t.co/0joICVfvCC

Cowboys could have clinched the NFC East today with either a win or a combined Eagles and Redskins loss and the exact opposite results occurred.
Monster road win for the @eagles especially after playing near 5 quarters in Dallas and losing Wentz as they have.   Time to bust out the dog masks again and keep running it back with Foles.
What a crusher.
Let‚Äôs see if that throw snaps Goff out of it. Terrific read and rip there.
@PatrickASchmidt @Eagles Wince.
Goff is in a deep slump and there‚Äôs really no other way to say it.
We are just 15 minutes away from the red hot take that the @eagles offense ‚Äî and team ‚Äî functions better with Nick Foles as the quarterback rather than Carson Wentz.
The @49ers finishing well again,  2nd straight win to beat @Seahawks who still haven‚Äôt clinched a thing and host the @Chiefs next week in a huge game for both teams coming off a loss, with implications for playoff and seeding races in both conferences.
A season saving W for the Steelers. Huge. They still lead the North, Ravens still the 6 seed.   The #Texans are now the 2-seed but, remarkably, still haven‚Äôt clinched a thing.
OT in Santa Clara while Brady has 150 seconds and the two minute warning to tie the game from 75 yards out.  Week 15 has been tremendous.
The #Steelers have achieved ‚ÄúMake Belichick Burn His Timeouts‚Äù status.
What a play by @joehaden23
This is....something. https://t.co/b4eI96bmIf
Boswell could get cut before the 4th quarter.
@notthefakeSVP @AndrewSiciliano Dumb-gate.
@AndrewSiciliano Gate-gate.
A #Patriots win would also clinch a playoff spot for the #Texans
Congrats to the #Bears and all their fans: the @ChicagoBears are champions of the NFC North, heading to the playoffs for the first time since 2010 after eliminating the #Packers from playoff contention.
Don‚Äôt look now but the #Redskins are one game out of the lead of NFC East, which, thanks to the #Cowboys shutout loss, remains an officially open question heading into Week 16.
Lots at stake in Pittsburgh:   @patriots win: they win East, @ravens take North lead and your new 6-seed: @colts who beat @titans in Week 11.   @steelers would be EIGHT-seed  If #Steelers win, they stay in North lead, #Patriots clinch nothing, #Texans stay 2-seed, #Ravens stay 6

Make that TWO sacks and a pick for @JabrillPeppers #GoBlue
The @Browns are a talented, tough football team. As my long time friend @StuartScott would say: better recognize.
Wow. Will front guess that this is not the right call kicking a FG rather than going for it on short yardage.
@geoffschwartz @AaronNagler @kurt13warner He is. And terrific there too. Had a blast doing the London Game with him. @Nate13Burleson crushed it today too with @SteveMariucci   My Net slowing building
Congrats @VonMiller on becoming @Broncos all-time sacks leader and getting the record with a crucial, well-timed sack.
So far this fantasy week, I‚Äôve had one receiver get hurt and leave with the first no-catch game of his career, another have a gimme TD pass go off his helmet, a running back 35-yarder wiped out due to penalty and faced a kicker with a 22-point day.   See ya. https://t.co/JFIe3suLUB
@AlbertBreer Teed Right Up, also the name of a video sent to Woody Hayes Center.

Sack and a pick for @JabrillPeppers #GoBlue

@DrB365 Too soon. The Titans or Colts win tomorrow and the South remains an open question.
@martindelp With all due respect.  Didn't mean to come forcefully, but I usually don't respond well to people with a following your size who I also don't know come at me with something starting with a WTF.
Texans: 10 wins after starting 0-3 and can clinch the AFC South if the Colts and Titans lose tomorrow   Jets: 10 losses for a 3rd straight year but more quality snaps for Sam Darnold.
DeAndre Hopkins 50/50 balls are more like 70/30.
OK, Sam. Let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got.
DeAndre Hopkins. That‚Äôs what happens. @DeAndreHopkins happens.
@martindelp The game I did the pregame for and the game I did halftime for and the game that was 16-9 at halftime when it should‚Äôve been 21-3. That game.
Texans melting down.   They should‚Äôve been up by two scores, kept Jets in the game, let them back in with poor red zone play, cant protect Watson, who can‚Äôt ‚Äî or won‚Äôt ‚Äî protect himself.   And now, for the first time all game, they NEED to score points.   Let‚Äôs see what happens.
@peter_king Or totally derelict.
BOB just called timeout and bailed Todd Bowles out for not challenging a clear first-down.   We‚Äôve seen the replay now TEN times and Bowles still didn‚Äôt challenge.   Insane.
Sam Darnold, looking terrific. Tough to take down, tough to contain, tough to defend.
@AndyCarlsonShow Thanks!
@scrubbybubbles Ha! It's a misspeak.

@mikefreemanNFL It is. Saw it Tuesday our here.
This is the first time Los Angeles send two teams to the NFL playoffs in the same year since 1985 when the #Raiders lost to the #Patriots in the Divisional round and the #Rams lost to the eventual champion #Bears in the NFC Championship Game.
Because the @titans couldn‚Äôt convert in the same exact situation in their London Game, the @Chargers now 2-0 in going for 2 at the end of regulation rather than playing for overtime by kicking PAT.
@PapaTools Indeed Kenneth.
Philip, last two @chargers national TV appearances:  Down 16 in Pittsburgh, Week 13  Down 14 THREE different times in Kansas City, Week 15  2-0
Having part of a dozen of them, I can safely say this is easily the best season of Thursday Night Football ever.   What a finish.
WOW  WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW   (WOW)  Holy üí©
Philip is @ProFootballHOF amazing.
Two Chargers receivers named Williams, two Chiefs running backs named Williams. Everyone is named Williams. https://t.co/uykMiS9Xrm
Hey @NFLResearch has there ever been a game where all the touchdowns were scored by people named Williams?  Asking for a friend who could use one from a guy named Hill.
A play is never over with @PatrickMahomes5
About to go live on @instagram with @ericstonestreet for a couple of minutes to check his pulse before his @Chiefs take the field tonight on #TNFonFOX

If @RamsNFL win, they clinch a bye-week and the @dallascowboys grab the 3-seed over @ChicagoBears based on conference record.   AFC action is complete and seeding 1-6 remains the same. Big week for @Chiefs who gain a full game over all other top 6 seeds except @Chargers
Week 14: Walkoff #Cowboys OT TD #Chiefs need OT to beat @Lj_era8  #Raiders blocked FG win over #Steelers #Dolphins walkoff Hook, Ladder and Drake play vs NE #Colts snap #Texans 9-game win streak @bakermayfield beats Cam @Saquon runs for 170 @KingHenry_2 99-yard TD  And more
The dreadful turf helped the #Raiders there but the @Athletics better fix that before @TheKylerMurray gets there.
This is one of the most exciting, competitive, meaningful weeks in the #NFL that I can remember.   Just great seat-edge fun.
Just had a rare helmet contact call on the offense in a big spot in Dallas.
That‚Äôs an empty hand in Oakland.
I know it‚Äôs real specific but....  Can we please make a rule that if you‚Äôve been shutout halfway through the 3rd, you‚Äôre not allowed to group celebrate a TD you scored because your defense set you up on the 1?
The moment when @ericstonestreet thought the @Chiefs were going to lose and then didn‚Äôt change expression in the @nflnetwork Screening Room even though he had just witnessed @PatrickMahomes5 convert on 4th and 9 with a ridiculous, cross-body 48-yard pass. https://t.co/SWrWDWse9u
@KVanValkenburg It was both improbable and entertaining.
Josh Dobbs just handed off to Jaylen Samuels for the #Steelers in the 3rd quarter of an extremely important one-possession Week 14 game.   That is a sentence I didn‚Äôt expect to type.
Every time I watch this, the more I can‚Äôt believe this actually happened.   And to the (usually) most consistently fundamentally sound, coached and drilled team in recent memory. https://t.co/rKYCJY1Jb4
Check of all that. Nothing will ever get more Twlight Zone in Miami for the Patriots than the Hook, Ladder and Drake to win at the final gun.
Man @TeamJuJu is as elite as they come. #Steelers have two No. 1s
Usually plum jobs currently open that we‚Äôve heard this week no one really wants:  Oscars host White House Chief of Staff Teammate of LeBron James
The #Steelers have absolutely fallen flat and need a wake-up call, STAT.
OMG!!!!!   The #Dolphins   I mean,  OM to the G.
Down 2 points, 4th and 4 from their own 40, #Dolphins decide to punt and play defense on Tom Brady.   Has NO ONE in the AFC East learned???
Laces out in Kansas City.   It‚Äôs overtime.
Justin Houston with the trifecta of sack, fumble, recovery. Wow. #Chiefs
And all the @saints did with that momentum change from the Hill blocked punt is score 22 unanswered.
Goodness, @PatrickMahomes5 is creating arm angles that previously haven‚Äôt existed in the history of arms or angles.
Josh Johnson is in the game for the #Redskins down 40-0 just 5 days after being signed. It‚Äôs his first action since 2011.
In desperate need of momentum, #saints just got a blocked punt by their Everyman Taysom Hill.
No tougher place in the #NFL to win in December than Arrowhead and, so far, the task does not appear to be overwhelming for the @Lj_era8 led #Ravens
Meanwhile, Tom Brady is absolutely killing it today. He is ageless and remarkable.
Check that: try Bolden‚Äôs first career TWO touchdown game on for size.
For @Patriots fans wondering what Twilight Zone stuff could happen to them in Miami this time, try a 54-yard TD run for Brandon Bolden on for size.   It‚Äôs his first rushing TD in 4 years.
@Rickyjaay_ @nflnetwork Will do it each week from here on out.
@ShaunOHara60 @nflnetwork @michaelirvin88 That is funny and true.
@TomPelissero Pomade and Weather together.
@getnickwright @NFLGameDay Will do Nick. Hope you're well.
@mdoogal59 @bakermayfield Wish I didn't sound so snarky, but it's still truly the most bizarre fashion I've seen someone react to being fired mid-season: go on a media tour in which you mention other quarterbacks you could've had. And then sign a week later with a division rival.
@skinztattoo Hey man, just giving credit where it is due. Last 4 weeks, there hasn't been a more impressive team than the #Cowboys -- happy to do it for #HTTR when it's due!

Note to Anthony Lynn: go for it on all future 4th-and-1s on the plus-side of the field tonight.
Mike McCarthy has not forgotten how to coach. He will get a gig next year, perhaps in Ohio.  A sad ending to a successful lengthy run that just wasn‚Äôt decorated enough by Lombardis with one of the all-time best in his prime years.
I know it‚Äôs painful #Jets fans. It‚Äôs just very awful. But in the long run, the loss means you‚Äôre one step closer to Nick Bosa or another truly terrific prospect. And a new HC who will hopefully get a better fate and hand dealt by the football gods than Todd Bowles.
No way Murray made the first down in New England. That‚Äôs an absurd stick with the call.
The #Raiders are currently giving the #Chiefs all they can handle.
Of all of Belichick‚Äôs oddities and habits, nothing beats him keeping his challenge flag in his sock.
Just leaving this one here from mid-week. https://t.co/uvIH9jofmG
The @RamsNFL clinch the NFC West and take over sole possession of first place in the conference.
The #Bears just went halfback option to tie the #Giants from 10 points down with 2 minutes to go to force overtime.   And with Cohen on Hanukkah, no less. Or an hour or two before it.
The 2-win #Cardinals just won in Lambeau Field. They‚Äôre now the 3-win #Cardinals and let the full-on recriminations begin in Green Bay.
The @Jaguars D saves the day, pitches a shutout on the red hot Andrew Luck and ends the #Colts win streak at 5 and their own losing streak at 7.
By the way, @obj now has 2 TD passes this season and is the first @LSUfootball player to do it since Zach Mettenberger in 2015.
Odell @obj becomes the first @giants player to throw and catch a TD pass in the same game since @obj did it in Week 5 of this year.
Quarterbacks nobody saw playing meaningful minutes in Atlanta this weekend: @JalenHurts and @RGIII
Odell, touchdown passer. @obj

Also asked Byron if he and his teammates are aware his coach is nicknamed The Clapper? https://t.co/OvKUEF0HiP

@RossTuckerNFL Ross.   (There‚Äôs all of December left)
That 3 @dallascowboys wins over Atlanta, Washington and the Saints in a week and a half. All with what may just be the best, fastest front 7 defense in the league. https://t.co/DM7Q4gkh6C
Cameron Jordan, wow. @camjordan94 gets held and still comes up with the sack, forced fumble and, it appears, recovery. That‚Äôs a superfecta, right there.
That was an absolute helmet launch by Jaylon Smith. He‚Äôd have been ejected for that at Notre Dame.
Are there two Van Der Esches on the field tonight?
Here we go.
Taking one for the team is #ForTheBrand right, @PatMcAfeeShow?
Let's see if there's enough time for @drewbrees to flip the script here and score before halftime, after which the #Saints get the ball again.
The @dallascowboys are flat-out punking the #Saints right now, causing frustration and anxiousness they're not used to feeling. Exactly what @TankLawrence predicted. With a bit more flavor.
Beautifully blocked screen for a TD. 10 first quarter points for #Cowboys and 4 first quarter YARDS for #saints  What a start
It appears tonight is Eli Apple‚Äôs birthday.
@JimmyTraina Thank you, sir. I will consider under the category of "honorable mention"
Quality start from @Dak and #Cowboys but a huge hold by #Saints
@JimmyTraina How dare you not rate the first and only 4-man booth ever, Jimmy? Isn‚Äôt one game enough to qualify??
@MichaelChiklis Respect your surroundings, Michael.

Tomorrow‚Äôs @RichEisenShow poll question. https://t.co/4w8FGSrnUB
@terrellfant @RichEisenShow @bakermayfield Thank you sir
@ByKyleKelly Thank you sir
It appears the #Titans like to play Monday Night Football in the state of Texas.
@VOLFAN0531 @nflnetwork @bakermayfield Nope. On NFLNet, ABC and ESPN.
@ZakkRowan @nflnetwork @bakermayfield Yep. I will wake up dangerous that day too.
@JBFlint Works for the State of the Union, which, in a way, the NFL Draft is.
To answer question from some here: @nflnetwork is STILL doing our NFL Draft coverage. ABC is just the exclusive *broadcast* draft home and while I, as always, wish my Bristol friends the best, to channel my inner @bakermayfield, I plan on waking up dangerous that broadcast day.
@MMehtaNYDN Well played! (But if I was allowed to gamble, I'd have put money on a Gronk TD the minute I saw this backpage)
The #Vikings have finally kicked a successful field goal against the #Packers this year.
Note to Packers, if you‚Äôre not going to sneak it on 4th and inches, you should account for Harrison Smith.
That‚Äôs the 5th missed field goal the #Vikings have missed against the #Packers this year. Bailey now two-thirds of the way to a full Carlson.
That‚Äôs the 4th field goal the #Vikings have missed against the #Packers this year.
Andrew Luck has been fantastic. Hearing all the talk that he should be in the MVP conversation. And he should, if the conversation ends with @drewbrees being the obvious choice for MVP.
The #Broncos win puts the @patriots in the AFC 2-seed through 12 weeks with a @Texans MNF win keeping the @Steelers in the 4-seed heading into December. The @Chiefs watch their lead atop the conference tighten a bit during their bye.
Wow, Big Ben picked in the end zone as the #Broncos have won back-to-back games against next week‚Äôs SNF Flex Gamers ‚Äî #Chargers #Steelers ‚Äî and, at 5-6, are suddenly in the AFC playoff mix.
The #Colts have won 5 straight and, at 6-5, are above .500 for the first time since Week 5 of the 2015 season.
Andrew Luck, everyone. He‚Äôs back and better than ever.
Kiko is playing his Alonso off for the #Dolphins today.
While his 2004 draft mates are like the proverbial front-lawn iron deer, Big Ben is still as elusive from and problematic for the pressuring defense as ever.
Frank Gore, a future @ProFootballHOF deep into his second decade of wanting you to come get some.
We have a Geno Smith sighting in Los Angeles
The @AZCardinals have run only 8 offensive plays in their last two 3rd quarters.
@AndrewSiciliano I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs number 1.
Wow, @TeamJuJu just went 97 yards for the go-ahead score.
Rivers streak of completions ends at 25, tying the all-time record of...Ryan Tannehill.
Rivers now first QB to start a game 23-for-23. Is that good?
Last 6 possessions of the half in Indy:  Colts TD Dolphins TD Colts turnover Dolphins turnover Colts turnover Dolphins kneel down  All in 7 snaps  This is fact
Philip Rivers 20-for-20, 203 yards. Is that good?
Note to t-shirt maker:  Kickers are touchdown throwers too  Lineman are touchdown receivers too
Baker just handed out the latest Heisman to Hue Jackson. Nice extended arms length handshake.
@JakeWeary Great call back
This #Panthers #Seahawks game is exhilarating. @run__cmc has 100+ in air and on ground and @DangeRussWilson just dropped a dime on 4th down from 35 yards out to tie the game with 3 to go.
A holding penalty just negated a beautiful deep ball completion for @Lj_era8 who still has #Ravens up 10 with 9 minutes to go.
The defending world champs have scored 19 unanswered since my obviously premature tweet.   You‚Äôre welcome #Eagles fans #FlyEaglesFly
The #Jaguars just had two TDs taken off the board, one by replay and another by penalty with the one by replay featuring a fist fight that resulted with @_fournette getting ejected amidst a monster performance.   It all led to a missed Jax field goal.   Wow.
Appears @bakermayfield woke up feeling dangerous again today
The defending Super Bowl champions are broken.
Wow. Up 21-nothing, #Browns Damarious Randall just picked off Dalton and handed the ball to Hue Jackson on the sideline. For real.  That just happened.
How have #Browns fared in their first game with Hue Jackson on the other sideline, apparently helping the defense? 3 drives, 3 touchdowns. 21-nothing.
It was a rough @NFLGameDay Morning as my so-called friends @kurt13warner @SteveMariucci @michaelirvin88 gave me grief for Michigan football all day. And then this happened to end the show. https://t.co/SLZ0Aelwvu
Only took less than one quarter for this back page to be as silly as we knew it was upon hitting news stands. https://t.co/fGL9rA6Jds
The @nyjets and @Giants both up early on last year‚Äôs Super Bowl teams. Took 12 weeks but this is easily the zenith of 2018 New York football. Take a snapshot, sports fans.

@DanStrafford I was absolutely thinking of Ben Drythe when I tweeted that! Great pull.
My guys are really giving me the business. https://t.co/TX9z3kVyaA
In Cincinnati, @bakermayfield will try to become the first #Browns quarterback to win back-to-back starts since Brian Hoyer in Week 9 and 10 in 2014 when he beat Tampa at home and....then Cincinnati on the road.
@hager330 @DonBonza Sammy, we need one of those flash-thingies from Men In Black.
@DonBonza Hang in there, Donny.

Tonight, in perhaps his best season yet, @drewbrees eviscerated the notion that a quarterback is handicapped by the inexperience or anonymity of his weapons.
In today‚Äôs @NFLGameDay Morning Bold Predictions, @SteveMariucci  said @AmariCooper9 would get 9 catches on 188 yards to break @michaelirvin88 Thanksgiving #Cowboys records of 8 catches and 157 yards.  Cooper‚Äôs line: 8 catches, 180 yards. Well done, Mooch! https://t.co/J3ahTnre1L
With @52Mack_ and @AmariCooper9 having quality Thanksgiving days, I‚Äôd have my head on a swivel for @BIrvin_WVU11 if I were the #Saints
What a play by @dak as Prescott @EzekielElliott and @AmariCooper9 have now all scored TDs.   Will go out on a limb and say that‚Äôs the formula for success for the #Cowboys
Wonder if Jay is wondering why Jon let @AmariCooper9 go right about now.
That, right there, is a No. 1 receiver for the @dallascowboys    As someone who had Twitter fun with the bounty the Joneses coughed up for him, I‚Äôm willing to say @AmariCooper9 is proving the price was right.
They‚Äôre thinking you‚Äôre gonna run Zeke inside the 5 so don‚Äôt run Zeke inside the 5 and get sacked and then check it down so Washington has enough time to score on both sides of halftime. https://t.co/bSc1ivzjBB

@DilfersDimes Brother, you don't have to explain yourself to a single soul. Anyone who has ever heard you talk football knows that you know football and that you have definite opinions.
Let‚Äôs peek at the final score between the #Chiefs and #Rams @ Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum https://t.co/9X9YeRV8fL
By the way, the Chiefs are still the team to beat in the AFC. Due respect to everyone else in that conference.   @PatrickMahomes5 is remarkable.
What a game.   What a night for Los Angeles.
#ForTheBrand
Of course, a defensive play could seal a 105-point game with @marcuspeters the one in line to seal it.
(A field goal ties this game and gives us more of this game)
Has this game hit the over yet?
How many QB have thrown for 6 touchdowns in the same game as a Pick Six?
Riverboat Andy.
Watching this huge, electric Monday Night crowd witness a memorable throw down in the Coliseum makes me wonder where all the people who thought pro football wouldn‚Äôt work in LA are.
This game is positively insane.
Hey refs, back off. @cheetah does that all the time for crying out loud.   Please do not insert yourself unnecessarily from here on out.   Thanks.  Signed, Everyone watching
Honestly, the Bluetooth-wearing agent telling @AaronRodgers12 that he just wrecked his bathroom while taking a shit is the most bizarre sports commercial I‚Äôve ever seen.
Come on, refs.
Looks like the refs are going for their own 40-burger.
What a big, huge night for the Rams defense. And they‚Äôve given up 30 points. This game is nuts.
@AaronNagler I heard that one too.
Note to all. This is why you pay players like @AaronDonald97 and, you know, @52Mack_
Mahomes is dynamite.  Can make every throw from every spot on the field using every arm angle.
Aaron Donald, just like Khalil Mack last night, shows he‚Äôs a game wrecker of the first variety at the biggest moments.   This game is lit üî•
@bomani_jones Don't think Patricia would like your posture in that video, Bomani.
@ColinHanks Quality base-covering, Colin.
Kirk Cousins falls to 4-12 in career prime time games.
Congrats to long starving #Bears fans ‚Äî quakity grasp of NFC North with 6 games to go.   And #Packers fans can take a step off the ledge. They‚Äôre only one game out of the wildcard behind #Vikings who they play next week.
The tide in this game turned when @52Mack_ popped the ball loose from Cook and recovered it himself, just as the #Vikings were poised to tie the game or take the lead.   He‚Äôs a game-changer if the first variety.
@morningmoneyben Mature.
That was all kinds of awful.   Heck of a first half for the #Bears
@andyd838 Look it up.
The #Bears WR group uncorking Steve Smith, 2005 vintage when he trolled the Vikings for their boat scandal by creating his own row boat in the end zone.
The @eagles look broken and Alex Smith broke his leg so, remarkably, heading into Thanksgiving, the NFC East looks to be the @dallascowboys for the taking.
...Brady? https://t.co/LEn6I4jXtr
OMG Jacksonville.   @steelers with a remarkable comeback.
That‚Äôs the catch of a man who arrived for work in a jaguar patterned suit. https://t.co/p2Cmtqgzs5
The @lions are now 1-0 in 2018 after practicing outdoors in the cold for an indoor game.
The Riverboat just capsized in Detroit.
Julio. Beast.
It‚Äôs also the first lead change in a @redskins game this year.   (It‚Äôs currently Week 11)
Colt McCoy just led @Redskins down the field to take the lead thanks to @AdrianPeterson 2nd TD of the day ‚Äî a headline no one saw coming in August.
Calvin Ridley botched catch winds up as an interception in the hands of the man the @dallascowboys drafted instead: Leighton Vander Esch.
Meanwhile, Walt Anderson just called a roughing penalty straight out of the first two weeks of the season to wipe out a Big Ben INT. Just a dreadful call.
Alex Smith down and his leg looked somewhat Thiesmanned to me. Just an awful look.

@chasableo I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. Hope this win can serve as a worthwhile distraction. Best to you and yours
What a big win for the #Rams especially with, putting it mildly, the week here in Los Angeles. Four game lead in the West with 6 to play.
The only way there was a receiver in the area for Seattle was unless you‚Äôre referring to area code.
Dante Fowler extended two Seahawks TD drives with bad penalties but showed why the @RamsNFL not only acquired him but kept putting him on the field. Strip sack and recovery inside the 10 to lead to the sealing TD. Wow.
Same as the Jets. https://t.co/wPMgAp68Uj
The #Chargers are 7-2, stout on both sides of the ball and a close object in the #Chiefs rearview mirror in the West through 10 weeks.
Congrats on having a real, bonafide red-ass walk-the-walk gamer at QB, #Browns fans. https://t.co/6lWzdmd5Yk
The @RamsNFL put the special in Special Teams. They are situationally brilliant.
Aaron Jones and the defense (or Osweiler) to the rescue.
With a special teams breakdown atop a sluggish offense, the #Packers are essentially daring the #Dolphins to win this football game.
You‚Äôre not fully bad unless you‚Äôre Kotitey Bad. https://t.co/Fb7VX7dGc5
Jamal Adams. https://t.co/GO7Ap0gEMU
The #Redskins lose half it‚Äôs offensive line and come up with a road win in Tampa, meaning tonight‚Äôs game in Philly takes on bigger meaning for the loser.
With the #Patriots loss to the resurgent and stout #Titans the #Chiefs now lead the only team they‚Äôve lost to by two games through 10 weeks.
Gregg Williams has won half his games as coach in Cleveland.
With his 2nd TD pass of the day @PatrickMahomes5 broke @ProFootballHOF Len Dawson‚Äôs 54-year old @chiefs record for most TD passes in a season with 31. He has 6 more games left to go.
No one shoots themselves in the foot from the half-yard line quite like the Atlanta #Falcons
The 92-yard run is the longest in the history of the Cleveland @browns
Don‚Äôt look now but @NickChubb21 just took it damn near the length of the field and the #Browns are laying it on Atlanta.
The @Saints are coming. @drewbrees is remarkable and your MVP front runner.  Absolutely terrific
The @nyjets current no-show at home against Matt Barkley and the #Bills is, in a word, unacceptable. And is what gets coaches got.
@HarryArnettCG Tongue firmly planted in Atlanta cheek right there

Why on this green football Earth is @CameronNewton still in this football game with the rest of the #Panthers offensive starters?

The #Steelers are up by 7 a mere 13 seconds after trailing by 7.
And that was WAY TOO easy. #Steelers

The #Titans have the more dynamic QB and the more aggressive offense and is about to send the Metroplex into serious DEFCON 1 status heading into next week‚Äôs Sunday Nighter in Philly.
@yashar Get well soon!!!!
Is the concept of that State Farm commercial being @AaronRodgers12 agent took a üí©üí©üí©and subsequently set a towel on fire by attempting to mask the non-courtesy flush scenario?
Two first quarter turnovers in their own end, but #Titans have tied game at 7 with 10 minutes to go in the half.

The @detroitnews sports headline Monday. https://t.co/5Y4oqmNpPj
Valdez-Scantling is balling out.
Tremendous game won by a #Saints team that has it all working right now, winners of 7 straight since the opening FitzMagic Disaster and a crucial tie-break against the #Rams.   And a üêê in @drewbrees ‚Äî the front runner for his first long overdue MVP award.
Michael Thomas goes Joe Horn with a flip phone under the goal post. Funny. But not timely at all.
McManus. https://t.co/gx2SqBoMpz
What a comeback by the #rams who have remarkably scored 21 unanswered to tie the game as we have reached Classic Contest status.   Here we go.
Wow. What a half for the #Saints
The long national nightmare of @juliojones_11 fantasy players is over: Julio has scored.
CORRECTION: the #Bucs do have an option.  And it‚Äôs the unbottling of #Fitzmagic
And then Ben finds Jesse James on a 50-yard strike. Double wow.
Josh Dobbs comes in and from own end zone converts a 2nd and 20 as Big Ben runs back in. Wow.
Big Ben down and in pain after absorbing full hit from behind on a run. Appears to be shoulder or clavicle hurt.
@Kenny_Mayne I‚Äôm fresh out of Bristol days it appears, Kenneth.
Brilliant grab by @gregolsen88 as the @panthers lay it on thick on the #Bucs who are fast running out of options
With two by Peterman today, the Bills now have thrown as many Pick 6s on the season as @NickMullens has TD passes. That‚Äôs 3.

Nick Mullens is the first @49ers QB to win his first career start since @CoachJim4UM turned to @Kaepernick7 in Week 10 of the 2012 season.
WHY IS NICK MULLENS STILL IN THIS GAME?!
Nine weeks into his return to coaching, Jon Gruden‚Äôs team has quit on him. There‚Äôs really no other way to assess it.
@PFTCommenter Your not wrong.
Do not adjust your sets: Nick Mullens now has as many TD passes as the entire Buffalo Bills team in 2018.
Mullens to Kittle &gt; Montana to Rice. #Kneejerk
49ers trade him to Pats to succeed Brady, completing the Circle of Life. https://t.co/yT1cbsED5Y

The Cleveland basketball team is in a contractual standoff with its interim coach.   And the Cleveland football team solved a standoff between its coach and offensive coordinator by firing them both.   That is all.

@Inversoj @nflnetwork @Eagles Thanks. By the way, Eagles fans were everywhere. My wife ducked into a pub to hear part of the broadcast and it was filled with eagles fans who flew out just to support the team in London and hang.
@SPXPhillyfan00 @RealGlenMacnow @nflnetwork @Eagles Actually, the NFL makes all broadcasts go to break during replays this year. And sometimes refs jump the gun before the return from break. It's all about moving the game along to keep time of game down. I personally liked TV hanging for reviews, but the league no longer does
@CJ_Jerome Yes. It was.
@BirdsBlitz @RealGlenMacnow @nflnetwork @Eagles Thanks sir. Any struggles were not in the truck, that I can tell you. Will always defend the crew. They were terrific. And very proud of our first time out. I do hope to enjoy doing it again one day soon for sure.
@RealGlenMacnow @nflnetwork @Eagles Just seeing this now, Glen. Feel free to take potshots at me. But the crew were no amateurs -- from the camerawork to the replays it was the same crew that works major Fox Sundays and some Thursdays. And they were awesome to work with.
High quality tweet. https://t.co/rtVQeTe9RG

@Ourand_SBJ It actually does.
@CaseyGeraghty That‚Äôs baaaaaad.
@mikeerickson news is breaking like crazy and he brings it every time he's here. he's also a multitasker for a living. I love the guy.   Thanks for trying to have my back but it's all good!
Patrick @P2 is actually 28, an undisputed Pro Bowler THIS YEAR (giving him 8) who can turn a SB contender into an actual SB winner THIS YEAR.  Cooper is 24 and, with tons of ability, must prove he can turn Dallas into a mere SB contender.  So, yes. https://t.co/RqUcPaGdmg
Well at least there‚Äôs nothing to talk about postgame with the #Giants.
Once you open replay, you can find anything in the process -- including a ruling of a completed catch even when asking if an incomplete pass is a fumble. Hope for Shurmur that's not the case.
Pat Shurmur now leads the league in being caught on camera begging his QB to throw the ball.
Get after it, Eli.
Witten should wear the Walter Payton Man of the Year symbol on his lapel like the players who have won it wear a patch on their uniform.

@WillBrinson wishcasting.   never heard that term before
Jason Witten shows he clearly hasn‚Äôt had Amari Cooper in fantasy last couple of years.
I mean, two yard @saquon losses become 2 yard gains as tackles for losses turn into multiple broken tackles. Corners no one else can turn get turned. And for big gains. He catches out of the backfield and successfully pass protects. Top notch.
Carefully. https://t.co/MypLuCoxR6

What a finish in DC  #Redskins with Alex Smith and Adrian Peterson lead the East by 1.5 games thru 7 weeks.
Of course it‚Äôs not Chris Myers fault.  That was, however, right on cue for Tucker.
Chris Myers just put the ziggy on Justin Tucker. Said he had never missed an XP in his career. And then Tucker just did. Saints gonna win unless there‚Äôs an onside kick.

It‚Äôs the FOURTH overtime game for Cleveland this year.   The football gods can NOT get enough #Browns football.
I think the #Browns were just charged with a timeout for a challenge that didn‚Äôt go their way in the last two minutes.
What a major, big-time, big-boy, stones comeback on the road in Philly by the @Panthers who come back from 17 down in the 4th.   And the winner of #Cowboys #redskins will lead the NFC East.

@AlbertBreer You‚Äôre.
@AlbertBreer I know your averse to emotional tribal displays at midfield. At least he didn‚Äôt plant a flag.
Might be nitpicking but @AaronRodgers12 doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone who stand for a smarmy Bluetooth-wearing agent representing him, let alone interrupting him while chatting with his State Farm agent during practice.

@CourtneyBVance Thanks, right back at you! Always enjoy you coming here
Well, at least the interference call that took two #Astros runs off the board won‚Äôt be talked about because it wasn‚Äôt the exact difference in the final score. And at least that call wasn‚Äôt made by an ump most humans think has no business being in the playoffs.   Wait.   What?

First, I'm the first voice ever heard in the history of MLB on @ESPNRadio Second, I didn't blame Aguilar for anything but said my first thought was why Aguilar left his foot on the base for so long.

We have a new elite receiver in the NFL: #Vikings @athielen19 who is one 100-yard game shy of tying the 57-year old record for most such games to start a season. His 58 receptions are the most of any receiver through 6 games of the Super Bowl Era.
In the vaunted history of @steelers no receiver has amassed more yards through 20 career games than @TeamJuJu with 1,478
For all the talk about protecting Andrew Luck, the #Colts sure aren't easing him back into things after his shoulder surgery and rehab: his 288 attempts are the most ever through 6 games of the Super Bowl Era.
@TaylorTwellman The rules are explicit and they‚Äôre explicit for a reason: to protect players from a hit like this. It‚Äôs an awful blown call, plain and simple. Which, respectfully, happens quite a bit in, if you will, your football.
Holy üí©
What a fantastic finish of a ridiculously wild sports weekend.
In the last 3 weeks, the @RamsNFL have won:  Short-week home shootout with #Vikings ‚úÖ  Nasty, paint-swapping division road game at #Seahawks ‚úÖ  First sub-freezing temp game of the year in #Broncos altitude ‚úÖ
Somebody call the fight in Dallas.
Jaylon Smith has turned into a terror for the #Cowboys and the rest of the defense appears energized by it.
Officials in Denver just popped the Rams defensive line for holding. Aaron Donald is being held literally on every play.
@JimmyTraina Everyone has to play once. No way getting around it.
The #Cowboys are absolutely punking the #Jaguars right now, taking a 3-score lead into halftime. The @dallascowboys have as many first-half first downs as Jacksonville has PLAYS.
Chad Kelly comes into cheers in Denver, albeit with 11 ticks to go in the half. To take a knee. We shall see if that means it's his job the rest of the way today.
Without question @JamesConner_ had an MVP type performance and, even with @AB84 scoring the game-winner, was a difference maker today

Closer takes it and the NLCS is now the best of 5 with home field to the #Dodgers
Stud closer vs. Stud MVP for the NLCS Game 2 win.
Dantonio can coach.
And then Oregon walks it off on Washington while the NLCS gets intense in the 8th with Michigan/Wisconsin and the ALCS still to come.   Quite a day.
Look at Sparty. That was stones. Of the coach to punt and play defense to the offense making it cash with monster late TD. Wow.
Dantonio's decision to punt and use time outs works, especially with Trace sliding out of bounds. It's an intense finish in the B1G.
@minakimes Ice squared.
Icing the kicker just worked in Oregon and a missed kick means OT with Washington. Unless a Pac-12 exec wants to phone in and rule that kick good.

@CharlesWoodson @UMichFootball They picked Michigan, yes.   But they also chose Michigan State and heard it.   And Corso insulted Harbaugh and then put the Badgers lid on. It‚Äôs time to stem the tide of respect.
Pitt and Notre Dame trying to outdo the others with dreadful, higher percentage, failing 4th down calls.
Some crazy scores right now in college football that would truly throw matters into a tizzy should they eventually go final.
@thestevenwoods @brianfink My kids have put them on quite a bit lately and compared to the alternative, you have no idea.
@brianfink Nope. Just having fun. Actually like The Chainsmokers.

@OsheaJacksonJr At least he‚Äôs not getting his scoring chances vultured by Washington‚Äôs 3rd string QB, my friend.
@EJBraun16 I caught that. You catch that @chrisbrockman
Pardon me for being salty.   Yanks getting their brains beaten in.   And my fantasy team is gonna lose because Kamara has gone from bellcow to specialist in a single half.
And it was properly upheld as a catch/fumble.   Mariota also still hasn‚Äôt had his forward progress stopped.
Under the new catch rule, that should be a catch.   Of course Triplette says otherwise, using what sounds like English.
Congrats @drewbrees   Becomes all-time passing leader in front of his family and fans with a 62-yard TD pass.   He now is the league‚Äôs all-time leader in: passing yards, completions, 400-yard games and 300-yard games. Just to name a few records.
If this was Little League, Game 3 in the Bronx would be called. 7-spot in the 4th for #RedSox
Taysom Hill now vulturing Kamara.
And Angel‚Äôs got the plate tomorrow night.   Probability for him to inordinately squeeze CC and eject him in a Zidane-like finish to his #Yankees career is significant. https://t.co/Uf3U2cxssZ

Helluva game. Tremendous drama.   #Texans 2-3 #Cowboys 2-3  Same record, two totally different feelings about being such.
That‚Äôs Play of the Year material.
What a beast of a play. I mean, if Lynch was BeastMode @DeAndreHopkins just went NukeMode.
@EricStangel Loved that show. https://t.co/NiZPLycycM
There‚Äôs @JJWatt making a monster play.
If there was such a stat as ill-timed 3-and-outs, the Houston #Texans would be near the league-lead.
Hell of a big time play by @dak
Was that the Dallas #Cowboys scheming in the red zone, smartly using their most dangerous players as decoys to easily game someone wide open for a touchdown?  Well, Mr. Linehan. I do declare.
Bizarre that the replay center never buzzed to check and the broadcast never mentioned how odd this wasn‚Äôt a naked-eye spot for a first down. https://t.co/idtmYTUZlJ
Kudos to @Seahawks for playing their hearts out after @Earl_Thomas is gone. And they have certainly discovered playmakers at RB and DB.   But for #Rams to lose both Cooks and Kupp and still win that game is why they‚Äôre the team to beat in entire league
Live shot of the @RamsNFL cojones https://t.co/cMURf64zRV
Love that McVay is going for this on 4th and inches from his own 43.
This #Rams #Seahawks game is a donnybrook paint-swapping affair that is all kinds of intense.
Congrats to @AZCardinals Steve Wilks and @josh3rosen on their first career wins.
Vikings finally get a kick to go thru at crunch time.
The number of downfield third down penalties on defenses are getting thoroughly out of control.
Seattle is gashing the Rams every running play.
How many coaches in this league are gonna throw it from the 1-yard line with @MoneyLynch in the backfield?  I mean, come ON.
Oh Derek Carr.
Excellent first half for the @seahawks  Big time stuff, like the old days.
Congrats #Browns to avoid the first 9-9 final to improve 2-2-1  Words I never thought I‚Äôd tweet.
The #Browns are about to lead the league in ties or apologies from the league Officiating Department or both.
Gano? Ga-YES!  63-yarder wins it for #Panthers at zeroes.   Giants gutted and fall to 1-4.
And then Eli takes the lead with a minute-plus remaining to give Giants their first 30-point game in 36 contests. Amazing.
The Browns are playing their third OT game of the year. It‚Äôs barely October.   And no, no team has ever started 1-2-2.
Last we saw #Falcons in Pennsylvania, they had a shot to beat the defending champs on their banner-raising night at the final gun  One month later, Matt Schaub is playing out the string in a 34-point loss in Pittsburgh for the now 1-4 Falcons.   Wow.
Meanwhile, Sam Darnold about to get his first home win as he and the Jets are laying it on the Broncos.
Someone give Mason Crosby a hug.
And then Eli comes right back and gets @obj in the end zone finally.
Even the most diehard of Eli defenders are going to have a troubling short week before a nationally televised appearance against Philly. Which could lead to an even more troubling long week.
In battle of inches, yards, scoreboard, pride and walk-walking, the @Chiefs are absolutely pounding the #Jaguars up and down the block.
Much better RZ trip for Big Ben there in 3rd q.
@AlbertBreer Are you really making a memory reference involving Ohio State?
That, right there in Pittsburgh, was a dreadful Big Ben decision.
What in the world has happened to Mason Crosby?

@colewagoner How? Florida would‚Äôve been up by 7 if the two was no-good.
You can‚Äôt blame a kid for scoring a Pick Six, but coaches should realize when they have an ability to ice a game with one play from the 2-yard line.
If you‚Äôre Florida, why not go for 2 and end it? Instead, LSU still has an ability to tie.
WOW. https://t.co/H9NePBwLOL

Tom Brady throws his 500th career TD pass to Josh Gordon, thereby breaking Vinny Testaverde‚Äôs all-time record of TDs thrown to different receivers with 71, thereby creating the first ever tweet to feature Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Josh Gordon.
First NLDS game was a doozy. Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs a tone setter for all other division series to come.
Luck takes a massive, good ol‚Äô fashioned direct hit that would have entailed a high possibility of being flagged had it occurred in any of the first three weeks.   No flag here, thankfully.   It appears the Great Roughing Crisis Of ‚Äò18 is fading.
First drive: Tom Brady, 9-9, 78 yards and career TD pass No. 498  Is that good?
Hader's stuff is so filthy, you have to wonder if a lefty could even connect using a paddle.

@eboland11 @DeSantis1984 Looks like MLB needs to work on its hug rule.
@eboland11 Erik, if expressing dislike of NFL wss your point, NHL makes its refs do it too. It‚Äôs a basic customer service to explain a ruling. And the NFL has fixed the catch rule.
Actually, it was from a satellite over Chicago re-positioned from Bristol, CT. https://t.co/DMVIlOguNQ
Once again: it's time for MLB to make umpires explain their calls to crowd and fans at home like the NHL and NFL requires its refs to do. Was that just staying with the call on the field? Or visual evidence of an out. It matters.   Make the umps talk to us.

A game-sealing first down spot for #Browns is respotted to the confusion of former head of NFL refs Dean Blandino. Raiders still live. My tweet atop this chain on life support.
The @saints get zero TDs from Brees but win a tough road game by 18 anyway. The #Saints are coming indeed.
Without question @A_kamara6 is my fantasy Best Friend Forever.
95-year old Seabass wins it for #Seahawks
The stadium in Glendale has generally been a House or Horrors for the #Seahawks ‚Äî both @RSherman_25 and Kam got hurt and played their last games as a Seahawk there last year and have to wonder if it‚Äôs now the same for Earl.   Not to mention, you know, the Super Bowl.
All eyes now peeled on @Earl_Thomas handle. Hoping for only the best for one of the best this league has seen while he‚Äôs been in it.
And Earl Thomas is down and getting carted off with a cast. Exactly why he wanted to get paid. And why no one ‚Äî NO ONE ‚Äî should criticize a player wanting to get his when he can.
First career TD pass for @josh3rosen is a 4th quarter game-tying strike.

What in the world, #Colts
Don‚Äôt look now but Marcus Mariota just won the battle of former second overall picks and just beat the defending world champs in OT. Vrabel pushing all the right buttons. #Titans
Monster win and performance by @andydalton14 @ajgreen_18 and @Bengals while the #Falcons lose two games on their 3-game homestand to fall to 1-3.
Luck, as good as ever.
Dan Hampton just picked Jameis to end the game.
Tremendous drive by Mariota, deep ball and run of his own sets up his go-ahead TD pass with 5 mins left on the World Champs.
We have an Osweiler sighting.
Man, the @Titans defense is no joke.
BREAKING: the #Patriots are not dead.
@justin_neal That made me laugh!
@BobbyKaje It‚Äôs called a joke. On myself. After last week.
That‚Äôs for all my Titans friends.
Nice response by the Titans and Blaine Gabbert.
Of course it was @52Mack_ who hit Jameis as he threw.
Jameis first drive back ends on a hit-as-he-throws INT.
Horrible injury to Tyler Eifert‚Äôs foot. Dreadful.
The great @adamvinatieri just passed Morten Andersen for most FGs in NFL history with his 566th.   Kickers are first ballot @ProFootballHOF too.
Matt Bryant just kicked his age to give #Falcons a much needed 3 at the half gun.

When you talk Top 5 offenses in the league this year, not many people mention the #Bengals   But we should.

@DesmondHoward Damn!
First ever Schneider Summit. https://t.co/OuA0BKTobX
Superb moment here. Congrats @89JonesNTAF https://t.co/RP1kWgjD1E
@DesmondHoward Getting a few tweets on this Des.
Today, @DrewBrees, who just passed @BrettFavre for most completions ever, needs 316 yards to pass Favre for 2nd most yards ever. Brees needs 418 yards to pass Peyton for most ever.  Brees already holds the records for most 300-yard AND 400-yard passing games. Lotta passing.
Per @EliasSports the last time the #Patriots played a division game against a team two games in front of them in the standings: Tom Brady's first career start exactly 17 year ago today.
Some Week 4 thoughts heading into @nflnetwork https://t.co/JaVBxGSS14
It‚Äôs Week 4, people.
@LesBowen He is terrific
Penn State should borrow Urban‚Äôs medication to forget that last play call.
Helluva B1G football game.
McSorley is something else, man.
The Ohio State D-line is no joke. And its best player ‚Äî and perhaps top pick in next year‚Äôs draft ‚Äî isn‚Äôt even dressed.
That‚Äôs a first down. Unlike other 4th down attempts I‚Äôve seen.
Me, after that game. @UMichFootball   #GoBlue https://t.co/umZDKB6SOc
Love that call by @CuseFootball Dino Babers. Even if they hadn‚Äôt gotten it. That‚Äôs how you win ball games, locker rooms, fan bases and recruits.
@Jimmyy_lee1 For my own selfish reasons, glad to hear about @directvnow as your choice.
#FakeNews https://t.co/YK6KzmBqCX
Dear ESPN: if any one of my kids is ever fortunate enough to play on one of your broadcasts and seems to get injured or isn‚Äôt playing very well, please do not keep cutting to a shot of me and my concerned wife in the stands. Thanks.
When total yards feels like the actual score. https://t.co/EOZdZ0lQ1P
For all those Georgia Bulldog fans like @chrisbrockman who might be missing it, @CuseFootball off to a nice start in #Clemson
Hurts into the game vs. Louisiana with one minute to go in the first quarter, up 28.
Will @Tuaamann become the first Heisman Trophy quarterback to have the second most snaps on his team?
@realWhitWatson @GusRamsey @RichEisenShow I was rather slagging the concept of a post show meeting.
Congrats to @Rockies fans -- in the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time ever.
Zach Britton is the Manchurian Reliever sent by the Orioles.
@GusRamsey @RichEisenShow If so, then how come there were no post-show RPM2Nite meetings on SportsNight?
Amazing that this is an outlier in professional football. https://t.co/6RK9aa4GFb
@TheBackPage Thank you very much!
@GonzoShitCock That was NFL-speak for ‚Äúwe fixed it‚Äù
By the way, a million passing yards and a million passing attempts tonight and not a single roughing the passer call.   Hopefully the Wednesday night conference chat did the trick.
This #TNF game is insane. Zero turnovers, zero sacks, @KirkCousins8 has #Vikings both and only first down picks ups on the GROUND, Kupp has a career best 129 yards already, 560 yards of total offense combined. And a second half to come.
No way. https://t.co/BtSSA0lXKL

@TopKaiki Ha! I'm well versed on the squad. 10 games Sunday, should know not to tweet about the ones I wasn't focused entirely on. (That said, Gabbert did officially get the win)
@TopKaiki neither do I.

@BaldyNFL @dallascowboys @Seahawks Damn.
*Conner.
Took 3 games, but the #Steelers formula to wait out @LeVeonBell finally results in a win: Big Ben making plays, @AB84 scoring, opportunistic defense and James Connor sealing the deal   Just in time to take the pressure off before the Sunday Nighter against Baltimore.

@coreybehnke Thank you, sir.
@GAJ13 @MiamiDolphins Incorrect. I lone wolfed Miami correctly in Week 1.
@TheFrankIsola @TheAthleticNBA @TheAthleticNYC Congrats man
@MoveTheSticks @RapSheet Savage pull.
@chrisbrockman @celtics @jaytatum0 @gordonhayward @KyrieIrving @Al_Horford @FCHWPO Enjoy them before the centerpiece winds up in New York.
@markschlereth Don‚Äôt know about the first, but certainly agree with you on the second. Great job today, Mark
Oh, and the @MiamiDolphins lead the entire AFC East by two full games after three weeks.
And as we currently sit here, the @browns have a better record than the following: #Patriots #Steelers #Cowboys #Seahawks #Falcons #Giants #texans #Chargers and #Raiders among others.
13 days ago: the Lions were embarrassed at home by the Jets  14 days ago: the Bears were demoralized in Green Bay and the Bills lost by 44 in Baltimore.   Today: Lions beat Patriots, Bills trounce Vikings and the Bears took over first place.
With no one else making plays for Brady because Gronk is blanketed, now you know why @patriots traded for @JOSH_GORDONXII and can‚Äôt wait for @Edelman11 to return.
@chrisbrockman @detroitjefff Call in tomorrow!
@markschlereth He‚Äôs Jewish. It was a joke bud.
And you usually shouldn‚Äôt throw an INT to start the second half to score zero points on either side of halftime against Brady.
Good first half for the Lions but you usually don‚Äôt beat Brady by settling for two FGs and failing to get in position to kick one before the end of the half.
This rule is fixed.   What most of the free football world thinks is a catch and should be a catch is now a catch.   Now let‚Äôs focus on making what everyone thinks is a sack and should be a sack be a sack. https://t.co/oncPQBHrEm
Of all coaches who should know better than to settle for FGs against Brady, it should be someone who has seen that tactic fail multiple times first hand. #Welp
It‚Äôs just so wrong. And it just turns off fans. https://t.co/Ze16IU7Wbg
Meanwhile, two weeks after suffering the nightmare loss in Green Bay, the @ChicagoBears sit alone in first place atop the NFC North, which, you know, not a soul saw coming.
The difference between Mayfield and Rosen:  1) The Bears have an elite pass rush and far better than the Jets (who tried to get Mack themselves)  2) Mayfield got into the game in a two-minute situation at the end of the FIRST half.
@JaredStillman We all make mistakes indeed.   (Who got the win today, Jared?)
Pardon me. It‚Äôs @markschlereth who said it. L‚Äôchaim.
Of all people, @Earl_Thomas picks off Dak to shut the door on Dallas for @Seahawks first win of the year.   And the football gods wink.
Chris Speilman calls the Rosen set of downs ‚Äúa baptism by fire‚Äù  Does someone want to tell him?
Bestill my beating heart: it‚Äôs Rosen Time.   After being cautious and patient with him, the Cardinals decide a must-have two-minute drill with Khalil Mack on the field is the time to insert Josh Rosen.   Go figure.
What in the world was Matt Nagy doing there? Keeping O on field for a 4th down attempt only to call timeout for a FG attempt who could‚Äôve just attempted without burning a time out?
Somebody start a GoFundMe to convince Steve Wilks to play @josh3rosen
Release the Rosen!!!
Bears coming back in Arizona where one has to think Josh Rosen needs to be checking in sometime soon.
The @Saints will a monster road win as @drewbrees forces OT and wins it in OT...with his legs.
And looks like it‚Äôs an ACL for Jimmy G. Ugh.
As the Saints and Falcons head to OT, the football world holds its collective breath over the prospect of a tie in a 3rd straight week to start the season.
Don‚Äôt look now but Blaine Gabbert just beat the #Jaguars  in Jacksonville to put the @Titans in first place.
Brees, spin-o-rama
Jimmy G is down and hurt.
At this rate @ClayMatthews52 is gonna get flagged out of the league.
BREAKING: the #Chiefs were forced to punt.
Watching @Chiefs offense is like watching a video game. @PatrickMahomes5 just found his 9th different receiver for a TD and he‚Äôs just 10 quarters into the season.
Eli is carving up the Texans and Deshaun looks shockingly lost. If this doesn‚Äôt change fast it‚Äôs 0-3 for Houston.
Wow @PatrickMahomes5 you are ridiculous.
If you thought Bills would be up 17-0 and inside the 10 at the end of the first quarter in Minnesota. https://t.co/1fyk1fYFe4
Week 3 always huge. Gets late early for a lot of desperate teams, the difference between 2-1 and 1-2 is huge and some teams that no one saw coming can go to 3-0. It's big. https://t.co/V0TMKh91rG
@kelitos_way @NFL That's not very positive, Kelly.
@mikefreemanNFL Wrong show, Mike.
Not pictured. Me asking Irv if there was any green room chest bumping for the Jets at any point during the game.  Alas. https://t.co/wQVGA5cnt6
@AndrewSiciliano The weight of @chrisbrockman removed as he left to root for Georgia football.
As @AaronRodgers12 faces Alex Smith today, fun revisit of this now 13-year old video ‚Äî @MikeMayock with the greatest mock draft prediction ever. Glad my incredulous reaction to Rodgers dropping all the way to @packers meant I was on the right side of history. https://t.co/BcV61X4igg
It‚Äôs Week 3, people.
Setting up the Revenge of The Gabbert storyline in Jacksonville no one saw coming.   It‚Äôll be Gabbert‚Äôs first start in Jacksonville since his last home start for Jacksonville, a 37-3 loss to Andrew Luck in 2013. https://t.co/lpMIBta6VY
Fourteen quarterbacks were taken in the 2005 #NFL Draft and 3 will be Week Three starters in 2018:   The first two drafted, Alex Smith and @AaronRodgers12   And the last one drafted, 7th rounder Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Gotta be honest. Never saw Costanza Sanders pitching @kfc coming.
Ticket punched. @Yankees 54th postseason appearance.

Bro, the entire point is that he‚Äôs officially NOT 1-0. https://t.co/GTMQzYXREG
The latest example of why ‚Äúwins‚Äù could be the least valuable statistic to measure a quarterback‚Äôs value and success: tonight‚Äôs #Browns W officially goes on the record of Tyrod Taylor.   Baker Mayfield career W-L record is still 0-0.
This, right here, is all kinds of top-notch fantastic. https://t.co/lQtFRuAqbZ
Now #Browns get mini-bye to get ready for his no-doubt first career start: at the Black Hole, Hue Jackson‚Äôs former place of business. What a perfect setting for sure.
Normal take: Congrats, @browns fans on the long-awaited win and born star at QB!! #DillyDilly  Hot take: the #Browns would be 3-0 if @bakermayfield started the season.
What‚Äôs quieter right now?  The Browns regretted not taking Darnold takes I saw all over TV today?  Or the Thursday Night Football sucks takes?
Quality response, good running and two 3rd down conversions and almost a third for Darnold as #Jets retake lead. Fun Thursday night game.
Now THATS the way you fire up the home crowd.
Mayfield brings a certain energy that‚Äôs been missing in Cleveland doesn‚Äôt he?  Exactly why he should‚Äôve been out there since Snap One.   You put all the eggs in his basket back in April. Might as well start living and dying with him now.
Joe @Buck says Sam Darnold reminds him of Aaron @TheJudge44 and even the @nyjets fans who double as @Mets fans would take that in a heartbeat.
