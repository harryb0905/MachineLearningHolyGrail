No matter what, the most important thing about tonight is that art competed with other art and we now definitely know what the best art is.
I can’t tell you @DonCheadle you have to wait till next week. https://t.co/utt1mZFuCT

Get ready @DonCheadle is live in 30 minutes tweeting tonight’s #BlackMonday 10pm/9c and if you feel like you are missing out on the #OSCARS just read all his tweets like they are lyrics to a Freddie Mercury song. https://t.co/UuUgsz1BkM

@DGubs4ALL @ComedyCentral I rewatched it this weekend. It really is a spectacular hilarious and heartbreaking doc.
