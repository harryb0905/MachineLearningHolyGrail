@SmooveHeff It’s all good. Kanye told me out of his own mouth that 808s and heartbreaks was inspired by Rappa Turnt Sanga so I’m super good. He said he loves the fact that my album was a bunch of love songs with a ton of bass. 808s (bass) and heartbreaks (love songs) Trust me I’m good brotha
@SmooveHeff It’s fine bro trust me. I’ve made big peace with this shit a long time ago. Shits funny now.
@SmooveHeff 😂

I also see not too many ppl know the difference between Vocoder and auto tune. Good lord I just want y’all to be informed. That’s it. I never get mad at the comments I only get jealous at the confidence of stupid ppl because if we all had that AND we were well informed.... whew!!
Boy! Mfs are good at forgetting who started this shit 😂. I can’t take this shit too serious because it would drive me absolutely insane. Me and God know the truth and that’s all I can ask for. Make sure you’re at peace with yourSELF and nothing/nobody can throw you off balance.

Speaking of dead ppl. Am I the only one that turns the music all the way down when I’m passing by a cemetery? My dad told me it was disrespectful one time and now I can’t help it and it’s always on the best part of the song.

First meal after the fast. Super racist diet 😂 @danyneville https://t.co/sWcLRDvckm
@ItsChoudhry Twitter doctors that heard it somewhere they can’t remember
Aint nobody tell me how unhealthy fasting is when I was poor as fuck and I was forced to fast by my pockets. Let me have this 😂 it’s better than losing weight from drugs like most of the industry. I’m not dead. I feel great. Thanx for the concern. Check on your depressed friends
@StevenBonus Which one is me?
@dom_sestito For sure. I’ll text ya. Thanx
@dom_sestito Well first? Drinks lol. Second. Taking better care of myself so I don’t have to ever do that fuck shit again lol. I appreciate food so much more now and I now know what it can do to fuck you up also. So basically. Better choices.
@MuyGalan Yup but my body’s not in charge here 😂
@Life_of_Austin Nothing but water and coconut water. All day. Nothing else. 14 days
I made it!!14 day fast. No solid foods. No liquor. No sex (for most of the time👀). No drugs. Just water, coconut water, and herbal drops for 14 days straight. Lost 20lbs and I’m ready to stop pissing out of my ass. Couldn’t do it without the wifey keeping me on track tho😬
@Delta Just landed at #LAX from #ATL 20 minutes ago. Hitting the stage and going back to #LAX for a flight back to #ATL. Wheels up at 11p pst. Work work work!!!!
@Delta Thank you for the amazing service over all these years. The very first time I ever got on a plane was a @Delta flight and that was the flight to go finalize my record deal in 2004. Still going strong. Thank you 2x
@Delta Touché. Understandable.
@Delta we gotta change these boarding/taxiing songs more often guys. All of Us Million milers (quick brag) have to hear these same joints multiple times a day. I gotta go perform in the staples center in a minute and Adele just put me in the weirdest mood. Now I’m crying. Thanx.

@ForeignGxdess You saw that tweet from Dj mustard? Probably not
@nikkiv723 You know when you used to go to the playground as a kid and go down that spiraling slide and that sound you made? Pretty much that.
Get out my mentions and go talk to this man @DJMustard. I ain’t got nothin to hate about. @Jacquees my lil bro. I wouldn’t get on a song with the nigga if I ain’t fuck with em. I was stating the only reason (besides hate) that somebody would take Que song down. Now. Mind YO bizz https://t.co/XTnuoTXlRb

@Jacquees I thought I saw you promo it for Spotify lol. Niggas was hittin Ella tellin her to sue ME lol I’m like damn nigga what’s I do 😂
@ashiaaa____ @ellamai @Jacquees When you put something on those major platforms you get paid for that. But you can’t make money from someone else’s song and not at least split it with them. Otherwise........ here we are.

@Deborahbillups2 Disrespect and get disrespected. Don’t ask for a handshake in the bathroom or ask me for a picture while I’m eating with my family and expect me to not look at you funny when you keep saying “just one pic man” “it’s just Instagram” or the classic “just want a pic I won’t post it”
@ChehadeTheKing Hit the dm
Ppl literally tap me on my shoulder and when I turn around they already have the camera on me and say “do something for my snap” but when I say “dude at least ask me first” I see a tweet later saying “TPain is an asshole” 😂 I just don’t get it
You can literally get anything you want (maybe even money) out of me when you see me if you JUST. TREAT ME. LIKE. A. PERSON. I understand you want a picture but there’s gotta be some kind of lead in to asking for it. A quick “hello, how’s your day going” goes a loooong way

Would anybody feel more comfortable if Alexa, every now and then, just out of the blue says “the other day, I couldn’t help but overhear you say you needed towels, would you like me to order some?” Since you know she’s listening. Would it be better or worse if she didn’t hide it?

@BrettOnTheDL I usually only have a couple hours a day to get a solid practice in so if most of that time is spent on trying to get to a skid pad then that would add up pretty quick and that would just be poor money management. Might as well walk to a track, throw money and leave.
@BrettOnTheDL This is exactly the mind set of everybody when I ask to borrow those things lol “why don’t you just buy one” 😂
Man I just need a parking lot in the Roswell area so I don’t have to drive an hour and a half to get seat time. Driving a real race car that far with no ac is not the move, and with the amount of money it’ll take to get it towed that far I could pay somebody to use their property

@SabDavage *thighs
Why can’t I find a brand of boxer briefs that don’t turn into xxl Jordan basketball shorts four hours after you put em on?!
@Air_Marx @ThisIsAssad That wasn’t my point. My point was would you wish and celebrate death if it was somebody you actually gave a shit about that did that? It’s easy to say fuck somebody that ain’t a part of your life. The man don’t deserve the way the internet is doing him is all.
Not one time did I try to normalize abuse and I’m also not gonna act like it doesn’t exist outside of celebrities. No persons untimely death should be celebrated. That’s my piece and I’m done with this whole “you can’t say that because you’re famous” shit.
This whole thing started me saying rip to my friend and I left it at that, until ppl started saying he deserved to die and they’re glad he’s dead. Then niggas got mad because I pointed out possible imperfections in the ppl they love, and now I’m the one that needs to be quiet 😂
Everybody has an opinion on how I shouldn’t have an opinion? Riiiiight. I hope your day gets better. #Topsy coming soon

@TammyPain_ Correct. Which is why this is so funny because it’s really bothering them
@bllyray Guy tried to turn at the last second on a yellow as I was going straight. First thing I said was “is everybody ok?” Never even tried to mention who I am. He saw the car and assumed
@CyclopsDaHero @PackieMorin I’m fine with that. Let me live how I want just as you have. Agreed?
@PackieMorin All the time
I got in a car accident a couple years ago and the guy hopped out his car and said “YOU THINK BECAUSE YOURE A CELEB YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT?!” I said “yea I woke up this morning and thought, I should go crash a car today, that’d be fun” that’s pretty much the internet
Y’all cray 😜
@NaturallyTiss You didn’t see my last tweet did you?
@MoesesKIIINT Nope. I’m saying if your dad answers yes and then gives some half ass excuse, would you be happy and celebrating if he got shot up in his car?
@Kaskonen Because the amount of unfollowers and new followers..... ppl need to be caught up

@paleburnedacid @sweet_deezus Do you kill them and celebrate their death?
@Sirfurface @GradPsych This is Twitter though. So whatever for the follows
@Sirfurface @GradPsych You’re right
Somehow my followers went up 😂
For some reason ppl think I’m tryin to promote sympathy for X’s actions. No ma’am. I’m saying don’t celebrate somebody’s death because of what you think you know about them when ppl right next to you (that you love) may very well be doing the same things.

@KekeKodeine No I’m not saying that it’s ok I’m saying keep the same energy for everybody that’s accused of the same thing. Even your loved ones. Fuck em. BUT I’m also saying it’s not ok to wish cold murder on anyone like the internet is doing currently
And all y’all niggas that’s saying your pastor ain’t homophonic while they’re preaching out of the same book that says being gay is an abomination, that shit is weird. More so, y’all niggas that think your replies is gettin more attention then my tweets is dumb. Your RT aint shit
@KekeKodeine Bro. Chris told y’all his mom got her ass beat and y’all made fun of him until he repeated the same actions. This shit Ain’t a joke or a troll.
@Yung_Mangu And none of them deserve to be murdered in their car. There are ppl celebrating this mans death. What are you saying. He deserves it?!
@Unaamorcita I’ve done a ton of fucked up shit. But any trick can only bring up things from the past that I’ve decided to give up and realize what I have now. You’re shit isn’t 100% public and you can act like you’re perfect so I get it. BUT NOBODY DESERVES TO GET MURDERD!!!
@ka5sh You think.... but a Jamie just got in trouble from 2002? It don’t have to be now.
@metcalfetweets @Twitch @RedBull_Music @hi_mija The good thing is. I don’t give a fuck. It’s about facts. Much like your weird ass president can speak his mind and still be president.
@Yung_Mangu No! But if you’re gonna go so hard as to celebrating someone’s death because they did what they did I would expect your timeline to be just as full of degradation towards other that have publicly done the same
@queerzo Nope. Remember when ppl said “amber rose left 21 because she fucked his homeboy” and then 21 said “nah she’d be dead” and nobody said a WORD about it? 😂 some ppl would say that’s verbally abusive but it’s not gonna make the news because SM is bored with degrading both of them
@Yung_Mangu I’m not gaining anything but ppl literally praise other that have done the thing they say this man deserves to die for and it not right for sure
Tupac was and dre was accused of all the same shit and never apologized but they’re legends I guess. Y’all niggas ain’t celebratin pac death because you know what comes with it and you won’t get likes and views for it. I keep seeing ppl saying X never apologized 🤦🏿‍♂️ come on
Look your dad in the eye for an extended amount of time in complete silence. Wait for him to ask you what’s wrong and then say “have you ever hit Mom” watch his expression change. It’s not gonna be all but holy shit is it gonna be a lot?
Y’all thought Gucci mane was the worst nigga alive then he became a better man and y’all said it was a clone 🤦🏿‍♂️ Get your shit together. Ppl can grow and evolve if you give them a chance and don’t kill them beforehand
Just think Any 20yo you know right that’s doing the worst shit, becomes a pastor at 45 and you’re like “well at least he came to terms with his wrong doings from back then” then he starts touching Lil boys like most of these fake niggas in the church is doing 😂 social media cray
😂 everybody that’s defending their pastor is saying “probably” “I hope not” “hopefully not” “I bet he wasn’t” “I don’t think” “maybe wasn’t” the fact is YOU DONT KNOW and that’s ok to you until you find out then their the worst person. But until then they can say what God said😂

DONT YOU TALK ABOUT MY PASTOR LIKE THAT!!!! 😂 Boy y’all funny. BY NO MEANS AM I DEFENDING X’s ACTIONS but y’all are quick to defend a pastor that just got outta prison because he told God “my bad” come on man. You have every right to not like X but to celebrate his death is lame
@nancyrh_ Nah just touching lil boys and gettin away with it
@jortle I know plenty that were brother that’s what drove them to be a person of God
Ask your pastor what he/she was doing at 20yo
@cherissemoett @TooHigh46301829 Everybody (artists and friends) was helping him in private while he was still alive because you don’t abandon ppl because they fucked up. You try and keep it from happening again. We all have skeletons. Don’t feel higher than thou because yours aren’t public.

@noblewolf21 @frankjohns_ Thank you
I know they say it’s never appropriate to ask a woman if she’s pregnant but sis if I’m havin a convo with you and I can see FEET and a FACE comin out your ribs, I’m gonna either say “congratulations” or “the power of Christ compels you bitch”. I’m saying one of em!!
@frankjohns_ Its bullshit out because ppl let it be. But. It ain’t our place to tell other ppl what to like. If ppl don’t like something I do that means I didn’t do it for them. All that old music still exist. Just go relive those moments you crave or contribute your own music and help fix it
@frankjohns_ Have you listened to the radio lately 😂 I’m fine. Thanx for your concern but this is working for me. You’re talking about a drug addicted alcoholic fame hungry dirty cheating hit chasing depressed nigga that didn’t wanna do anything but be on the radio. Do not want!! Still rich!
@frankjohns_ Nope.
Then the cops showed up and told us to get back on the grass and I said “well can we leave because I was headed out?” they said yes. Lit! Then they saw which car I went too and asked if I’m me. I said yes and then they asked for the pic 😂. Yard is still on fire at this point🤣
Left my house a minute ago and one of my neighbors’ yard was on fire and they weren’t home. My wife and I called the fire department and stayed on the line while they made their way there. Other neighbors stopped too. Not for the fire. But for pics with me. 🤦🏿‍♂️Social media
@cocinamarie @Kim_Madison_20 @KidBigE Backorders shipped out yesterday
@dcs1230 @Bloomingdales Yea. Everything has been resolved
@Bloomingdales she gave us like a pre sale price or something (her English wasn’t that great) but it definitely wasn’t any ill intentions. She actually helped us get a lower price with the way she did it. She just didn’t tell us she was doing it. Either way no sweat off my balls.
@Bloomingdales it’s all sorted. I went back because your employee was super nice yesterday so I didn’t think anything super shady was going on she just didn’t explain what was happening. Apparently she put my cash on a gift card for some reason and needed my info for the card.
@GameOverGreggy @KindaFunnyVids Crap I’m gonna be in Amsterdam 🤦🏿‍♂️
@GameOverGreggy Dang it! I missed it. Good news tho. You can get an app called RageOn! to get that sweet sweet chicken wing shirt. Best thing is. You can make your own custom shirts right from the app. Google images + RageOn! = Unlimited chicken wing shirts. You’re welcs.
I’m seriously considering getting a super suit made and wearing it like all the time. Who made @ConanOBrien super suit? I need that quality.
Real question for anybody that works at Bloomingdales: is it a thing to ask for id if somebody is paying with cash? I don’t wanna be that guy it just felt weird. I spent 1000 cash at one desk with no problem then spent 200 cash at another and got asked to show id. Is that normal?

@NewKingPrez The best place to be relevant
@iamshellyshel The world
@The_Ryanlouis Yes we would because the time we spend trying to make someone not racist is the time we can spend bettering ourselves
@The_Ryanlouis And I too have the choice to not give a shit
@poledarch It was the extreme for the bros
@Adamh904 You need to get a reddit account and subscribe to r/logodesign and r/graficdesign they’ll give you all the critiques and advice you need brother
@The_Ryanlouis And they have a choice to completely ignore me
@poledarch I get what you’re saying completely. The main thing is me not giving a shit if someone is uncomfortable and continuing to live my life as it were. This is like me being mad about a racist comment from somebody I don’t know. I just. Don’t. Give. A. Shit.
@poledarch I see it too but it’s the same with any joke. Somebody is gonna be offended. It’s up to the presenter to not give a shit and get the laugh. It’s pretty much all ppl that don’t know my humor that have the most problem bet whatevs
@john__raphael Both
If you want to see me “fuck up” on a regular basis and not give a shit pls follow all my social media pages and DaRealTPAIN on fortnite
@The_Ryanlouis @bunchof_Malogna Wht I couldn’t fit in that tweet was. I made these jokes in their faces and they laugh. Not because they work for me but because shit was legit funny. Your better isn’t my better. By all means call me trash by YOUR standards and I’ll sit here continuously being trash not changing
@erokroybal @GilaHank @_f_ckyotweets *facked up
@poledarch I got on stage last night and did my intro. After that a group of “bros” decided to boo me excessively. So I reacted to the disrespect by saying “if you don’t like the me or the show, go home and watch transgender porn like you do every night” so there’s that. Anything else?

@TammyPain_ Right? I’m not living to make anybody else comfortable. We all have a choice to move the fuck on if we don’t like what’s happening. Nobody’s opinion matters. We can all choose to live better but who’s “better” are we going off of? I like MY better, fuck anybody else’s. Suck it!!

I am all the way done with this “celebrities can’t say the shit that we say everyday” bullshit. I don’t give a fuck if you’re offended. Move on with your day. You don’t give a fuck about my feelings so lets not tighten that asshole when I say something you don’t agree with.

@bvile @NaturalBadasz My niece was murdered by her boyfriend so I know it’s insensitive but you and I deal with death differently and not one part of that means I have to go out of my way to make others comfortable. We’re both grown. It’s insensitive to call someone a piece of shit yet here we are.
@bvile @NaturalBadasz Um. A grown man or woman who can say what they want. Call the cops if an Instagram comment between a husband and wife has thrown your life off to where I’m a piece of shit for joking with my wife but no rapper is for threatening to kill on literally every song. Pls move on.

@TheWynterProj If she did I deserve it. But will that stop me from loving her with everything I got? No ma’am
@TheWynterProj My wife is strong as shit. Stronger than I’ll ever be. Imagine sitting watching ppl assume they know everything about you and having them be so wrong. I’m sure you wouldn’t be able to deal with thousand of ppl a day be so confident in their stupidity
@TheWynterProj You sound weak. If a light bulb blows you don’t burn the house down you change the light bulb and figure out what blew it and fix it not abandon what you built on for years. Ppl make mistakes. I’m sure you’re fun at parties and you’re current mate loves you very much.

If I’m wrong pls get a luxery rental place to correct me but when y’all be clownin new rappers for renting cars it baffles me because to rent a lambo, Rolls, or any other one niggas rap about, it’s like 3,500-4K A DAY. That’s still a ridiculous amount of money and you’d brag too
@xandy_xoo Everybody has a choice buddy. It’s obvious we’re not gonna change each other’s minds. If I would’ve listen to and followed rappers from my gen I’d be dead by now because it seemed cool to get shot. I’m gonna move on and continue to be happy. Much happiness to you and what you luv
Everybody want my cars to be rented 😂. Trust me I have no problem telling you if they are. In the “Black and Yellow” gmix, i rented the lambo for the video and I had my team go find a “rent me” sign. They cut it out the video but you can still see it right when my verse start
@xandy_xoo Only ppl affected are the ppl involved and my message is if you don’t like what you’re doing with/around me, go do something else that’s gonna make you happy
@xandy_xoo I’m not doing it to be sad am I?
@xandy_xoo Those are the things that make me smile. I didn’t say listen to my music. You have a choice to not like me but you can also move on and put that energy towards something that you actually like. The message was “do what makes you smile”

I just want us all to smile excessively at all times. The only thing worse than dying and going to hell is living in it voluntarily. Be grateful for the smallest and enjoy breathing.

@theDiJiTAL I don’t know why you thought me calling myself fat and super dark was “talking shit to you” but you’ve obviously never seen a real show of mine where I constantly make those jokes. When we finished the fifth song you looked at us and said “that’s all I got”
@ClintonSparks @theDiJiTAL Clinton. It was an hour walkthrough with 4 songs. I went through the unprofessionalism outside and still came in with a smile and did 5 songs. I didn’t have one word with this guy. I don’t know what else he wanted.
@theDiJiTAL I don’t know what problem you had with how I conduct business but you didn’t bring it to my attention and we could’ve fixed it. But when you only have 5 TPain songs in your computer I don’t know how much more you want me to take responsibility for
@theDiJiTAL You did a walkthrough with TPain last night and tried to turn it into a show. I pulled up to the valet and they told me I was blocking the “real customers” from coming in. I waited outside after they rushed me to get there. Still came in and did than contracted
I. Do NOT. Set. My. Performance. Times. The venue 100% sets my performance times. If you’re waiting for what you think is too long. You came too early. I Hit the stage when the venue says they’re ready. And they can push the time back if they feel like it. Tweet them. Not me. Thx

But also to be real. It just seems like @QuincyDJones is pissed off at the whole world. I have nothing but respect for the guy so I don’t know why we didn’t hold the song or tell me exactly what he wanted when I kept taking the headphones off beggin for direction from the God
@KingPegs @QuincyDJones I agree
And I still hated it when I came out of the booth. Then the song came out and it was even worse than it sounded in the studio. This is legit one of the reasons I don’t work with the managers I had anymore because if I said I was uncomfortable doing something they didn’t care 2/2
For the record I told my managers (at the time) and I told @QuincyDJones in his face “I don’t want to remake any of your past records because I know I’m gonna fuck it up. I’ll never be able to reach the greatest of MJ” it took them hours to pump me up to even go in the booth 1/2

Some lessons can’t be taught. Sometimes you gotta let someone destroy themselves, and the consequences will teach them every lesson they want and need. They will hopefully build themselves back up and realize what they did to bring the bullshit upon themselves. If not Fuck em😂
@DrowningPool86 @officialwilliet Never under any circumstance put a laptop in luggage. That’s a rookie move brother.

@Thoughtmose I think you read this wrong
There are even some ppl that’ll fuck your situation up on purpose just to try and knock you down a few pegs so they can try and catch up. Pls don’t let em and keep your mind strong and stay prepared for the attacks. Forgiveness is always stronger than hate.
Ppl don’t give a shit how your situation turns out if they don’t get what they want out of it. They’ll “hood you down” one second and then once they can’t level up at the same pace as you, then it’s fuck you. Stay healthy out there everybody, mentally and physically. ✌🏿
@ChristinaRay_ None of those companies on that paper have any affiliation with me. They sent money to some rando that convinced them they know me. That ma’am is the miscommunication.

@ZaneGalaxy I ain’t tryin to be a dick about it but a ton of ppl from there went in hard on me because of what the station started. I’m not takin that vague ass “we fucked up but not really” ass post. A lot of celebrities don’t care about shit like this so they just stay quiet. Not Pain.
@ZaneGalaxy Nah this ain’t good enough. They went into full detail when they were telling the city I took their money and breached a non existent contract so now I want full detail on how they fucked up and slandered my name with no right to. I’m not coming until I get a full apology fr

@iammarissag I love getting money for doing what I love. Ppl don’t get jobs as janitors because they love to clean so I’m not cleaning up anybody else’s shit for free either.
@TwilightMom806 😂 I’ve never heard of ANY of those companies. They went through a full deal without talking to me or my management and thought it was full legit. If that shit don’t say NappyBoy or Cinematic it ain’t real

@k3nsly They got finessed by somebody who convinced them that they were with my team. Unless they have something saying they sent money to NappyBoyTouringLLC they got fucked out of some money
Any fuckin ways!! New shit just dropped wit @RickRoss and @KodakBlack1k #FLORIDABOY
@_aem16 @rissamartini24 @BlcknessMnstr @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes I don’t know who has their money but it fuck sure ain’t me. We never signed a contract and trust me they weren’t even offering enough money for me to even wanna go through them playing with my money.

@rissamartini24 @BlcknessMnstr @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes So them saying I breached a contract that never existed is not only a fucking lie but defamation of my name and they WILL hear from me. If I’m sorry for anything it’s that y’all have to go through this. I don’t know how they sold tickets to a show that was never happening.
@BlcknessMnstr @rissamartini24 @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes I speak how I speak in life ma’am. I don’t work in an office and I don’t have a boss because I work for that privilege Just as you have the right to. Thanx tho.
@rissamartini24 @BlcknessMnstr @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes I just got off the phone with my team. There was never a contract issued for this show. We got an offer. We didn’t like it. They went up a little. We still didn’t like it. Found a better offer in Miami. I never signed anything nor agreed to anything regarding this show
@BlcknessMnstr @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes I’m not being negative. I don’t know why you think the stripper loving alcoholic isn’t gonna curse a few times per tweet. The shit that bothers me is all the ppl from your city thinking I’m gonna apologize for somebody else’s fuck up.
@BlcknessMnstr @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes You ain’t see the shit on MY page so I’m sorry you didn’t do any real research. Hope nobody wants to kidnap you, all they gotta do is make a flyer and you’ll go right to the address for them
@BlcknessMnstr @Enyssalynette @anahitorres21 @AlehCakes Because I’m not the one that did all that. Why don’t you look at the ppl that made the flyer and tell them not to make flyers until all the business is done and agreed upon. I ain’t sorry for shit because I didn’t tell anybody to tell you guys I was comin.
@anahitorres21 @AlehCakes Thank you. Somehow I always come out as the asshat in these situations because ppl don’t know what happens behind the scenes so they just automatically blame the artist like we don’t like making money or something.

@AlexWaveyBryant @kendricklamar It’s been 13 years and here you are with my name in you mouth. I’d say I’m on the right path so far. Just be great buddy. Live your life and put your energy into something positive for yourself and do better than me if I’m so trash in your eyes. Pls don’t waste this time.
@visionsgone Not yet I need to go ahead and download that bih. It’s on steam?
@AlexWaveyBryant Somebody should tell the ppl that’s givin me all these awards and plaques because they’ve been misinformed

@wardwilliamsvfl @MrByrdman2 @R_Dunn62 I’m not being a dick about it. Like I said everyone has their own taste. Every rapper I know who went for the model is divorced and on a reality show looking for another one. My wife and I have been together for 14 years. Before the check. I’ll take real love over Instagram likes
@wardwilliamsvfl @MrByrdman2 @R_Dunn62 Bottom line is. Even if that wasn’t me. As a man don’t disrespect another mans girl, wife, sister, Mom, anything. That is the mother of my children and I will promptly lay down whatever I have to in her name. She may be just “a girl that looks like that” to you but that’s my soul
@wardwilliamsvfl @MrByrdman2 @R_Dunn62 @MrByrdman2 id like an answer tho for sure. Just so I can know what ppl expect my wife to look like.
@wardwilliamsvfl @MrByrdman2 @R_Dunn62 Everybody has their own taste in who they’re attracted to. But just because I’m curious, what should TPains wife look like?

I can’t bring myself to trust a person that can eat a full meal without watching tv. I can’t even start eatin until I find the right show. I usually end up having to reheat my shit because I couldn’t find a show that fit my meal at the time. It’s like picking a wine.
@KUSHISBACKBABY @djkhaled Didn’t say all the way down. In this instance, “down” is just a lower degree of “up”. Opposite ends of the same spectrum, you see.

@My_BOY_ScOOp Because we just shot em
(4/2) this the last one for real  I promise 😂. In conclusion I just wanna say that @Bonnaroo made zero mistakes on that line up. They know what their analytics read and I’m sure they followed exactly what they should have to make sure they are covered. Thanks for having me. Fr.
(3/2) lol One more! I’ve done my shit. I’ve proven to myself and many that it ain’t shit for me to dominate the top. The biggest mistake I’ve made in my life is chasing that position and that feeling instead of chasing the love of my family and stability. I’m grateful for it all
(2/2) So with that being said. I’m really really not tripping on the size of my name on a flyer and you guys really shouldn’t be either. For the simple fact of knowing that there are hundreds of thousands of aspiring artists that would kill to be the last, smallest name on there
(1/2) To be real. My outlook on life has changed so much since I’ve gotten into this game and have seen what happens at both the top and the bottom and I’ve learned how to appreciate the things that I began to take for granted as I became more and more jaded and arrogant
@george_mikic @The_3rd_Power @kendricklamar @JColeNC @Migos I didn’t tell anybody to copy my shit. I was doin fine winning by myself.

@vegascowboysfan I got there at 0115. I wasn’t scheduled to perform until 0145. They still didn’t give me my bread until 0200. But you left soooooo. Not really my fault that you didn’t ask when i was scheduled to perform
@vegascowboysfan It’s called the back end. You get the first half when you agree to do the show and the second half when you show up. If they don’t hand me my second half when i show up I’m not going on stage. Come on now / You need a better understanding of business.
@vegascowboysfan The kind of drugs that make me wait until i get a check in my hand before i do my job. Sounds like you’re the loser.

I guarantee that rockstar would not have gone number one with me on it. Shit was a smart move to put @21savage on it. They know that relevancy drives a hit regardless if you like the artist or not. Hate them as much as you want but where’s YOUR number 1 record?
I see ppl tryin to make it look like I’m hatin on @PostMalone i fuckin love Posty and his music. I’m sure he didn’t even hear my version of rockstar. The label made a money move and won. I congratulate the shit out of Posty and @21savage for the #1 record. Feels good bro.
