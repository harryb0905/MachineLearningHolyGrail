Between 1946 and 1956, Don Newcombe:  1. Was best pitcher in the Negro Leagues. 2. Became first great black pitcher in MLB. 3. Won the Cy Young award. 4. Won the National League MVP. 5. Had the best hitting season ever for a pitcher. 6. Served two years in the military.

I'm still in awe that comedy genius @GaryGulman not only guest hosted for @KenTremendous on the PosCast this week, but he went FULL PosCast -- one hundred minutes of nonsense now available on @ApplePodcasts, @stitcher and a podcast station near you.
I've closed the first two Hall of Fame polls after getting more than 1,000 responses for each. Could still use a few more for the Hall of Fame pickup poll here ... we're going to start the Ultimate Hall of Fame Guide over the next few days. Thank you! https://t.co/ZH5BX4PmqV
This is a great question: What was the first moment of your life when you realized you were getting old? For me it was 1994 when I was in a restaurant reading James Baldwin’s book about the Atlanta child murders. I was 27. Waitress didn’t have any idea what that was. https://t.co/N505KEJw2l
@Super70sSports Wait, are we playing the basic game?
Now that it's recorded -- and, yes, it was touch and go for a while -- I can tell you that this week's PosCast guest is the amazing @GaryGulman.
Yes, that option is quite available. https://t.co/JMHBWsaMQF
A pitchers clock in MLB:
Daughter (at 7): Do they have Presidents Day in England?  Me: No.  Her: They do! It comes after July 3rd!  Me: You mean 'Do they have July 4th in England?'  Her: They have July 4th in England?  Me: Yes  Her: Why would they celebrate our Independence Day?  Me: It's a good riddle.
@Nick_Offerman It would be typical PosCast craftsmanship if it was you and I had just forgotten to ask you.
I just landed, and I have no earthly idea what this is about, and I probably don’t care, and yet I’m strangely intrigued. https://t.co/7aSHopK3NV

One more reminder, if you can make it -- come out and see @nlbmprez and me at the Topeka Public Library, today 2p-3:30. I'll sign some books, we'll talk about whatever comes to mind.
OK, all three of my Hall of Fame polls (I just added a quick pickup poll for some players I missed) are in one place. Thank you for doing these ... I think they will make for some fascinating insights. https://t.co/jYtuhrSwy6
Yes. https://t.co/yCjKH9ZXmd
I cannot thank you all enough for filling out my Hall of Fame poll -- AMAZING results that I think you'll get a huge kick out of. But there was something missing, so I did a second poll. This one asks you how you rate actual Hall of Famers. Enjoy! https://t.co/GdMqAvQ0gz
@mellinger @nlbmprez @TopekaLibrary Every K-State Game is magic.

@Ethan_Bryan Sigh. Not in town at all. Going to Topeka to speak at Public Library tomorrow and home immediately after. But it will happen. I'll be back.
On flight to KC, pilot just said we are going into 120 mph headwinds, adding an hour flight time. And somebody groaned. I mean, I don't know, but isn't the fact that we can fly through ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILE HEADWINDS worth, like, a little cheer?
@Howard_Richman Just for you, my friend.
@chambleebrandel I’m curious: Do you think it was classy to do to give him 5K after winning your first tournament in four years? Not right or wrong, but is that what you would do?
@pdubinkc Left a few pitchers off with similar credentials. I know Appier would get almost no support.
OK, rather than fill up everybody's timeline with Hall of Fame polls, I have put up a mega-monster Hall of Fame Google Form. I suspect it will take you 5-10 minutes, but the good news: No research required (or even allowed). Would love for you fill it out. https://t.co/JWhOdfzwtu

@sepinwall A good effort, though I probably would have guessed Carrell would pull too many votes. I think three would be possible. Four makes it really hard.
If I had made this a one-hour poll, it would have worked (the goal to get every choice between 22-28%). But as it stretched on, the M and S names have somehow become over-represented. I wonder who, with an M name and an S name could have been responsible for poisoning this. https://t.co/MIfZ70ZqiX

@CScarpaglia @MisterRora @traceysteele @BigStones00 No. He was offered 5k for his caddying services and 15k to shut up.
Interesting thoughts, though it's insane to think baseball card fans have ever been uninterested by the stats on the back of the card. https://t.co/5PyckmHfKo
@CScarpaglia @MisterRora @traceysteele @BigStones00 He wasn't offered 20K. He was given 5K. Then when he made clear that this was insulting, they were worried that he would go public with it. They reluctantly tried to throw him 15K which he thought was pitiful. You can blame the guy for not taking it, but they didn't OFFER 20K.
@16Cubs No, he paid him 5K. He offered him the extra 15K when the caddie said that was insulting and it was likely to go public.
I mean paying a substitute caddie 5K when you just won your first tournament in four years and cashed $1.3 million? Come on. https://t.co/jpcgMiWZ5L

Nominee: Ryan Howard. He was introduced to Buck O'Neil as a modern-day Josh Gibson. He averaged 50 homers a year the next four seasons. "Don't be ashamed of your power," Buck told him. And Ryan Howard never was. 10/10
Nominee: Willie Wilson. The modern-day Cool Papa Bell. I'd be all for putting in every player with 80 steals in a season. Four are already in. Add Willie, Davis, Vince Coleman, Omar Moreno and Ron LeFlore 9/10
Nominee: Jimmy Wynn. Not only is he one of the most underrated players in baseball history he also had the sweetest nickname: Toy Cannon. The Negro Leagues was ALL ABOUT great nicknames. 8/10
Nominee: Four overlooked contemporary second basemen -- Lou Whitaker, Willie Randolph, Bobby Grich and Frank White. It is easy to miss just how glorious a time it was for second basemen. 7/10
Nominee: Pete Rose. Yep, @PeteRose_14. He played a style of ferocious ball that comes directly from the world of the Kansas City Monarchs, Homestead Grays and Newark Eagles. 6/10
Nominee: Dwight Gooden. The magic ended too soon but Dr. K, in his prime, had more than a little bit of Satchel Paige in him. 5/10
Nominee: Bo Jackson. The Negro Leagues was all about legendary stories. So was Bo. 4/10
Nominee: Eric Davis. Pure power and pure speed, the very essence of Negro Leagues baseball. A little bit of Oscar Charleston but with a smile instead of a scowl. 3/10
First, the players already in the Hall of Game: Dick Allen, Brock, Cepeda, Clemente, Dawson, Rickey, Fergie, Lofton, Morgan, Murray, Oliva, Oliver, Big Doggie, Raines, J.R. Richard, The Wizard, Lee Smith, El Tiante, Wills, Winfield,  2/10
Every year, @nlbmprez and the Museum inducts members into the Hall of Game -- these are (mostly overlooked) players who played with "passion, determination, flair and skill exhibited by the heroes of the Negro Leagues." I have a few nominees. Maybe you do too: 1/10

@sepinwall What made it over the top was he was drafted by the Bears, it was finally turning around for the family, and they had him break his leg marrying Thelma.
@sepinwall Do you think the best ever example of this is when Keith breaks his leg walking the aisle in his wedding with Thelma in “Good Times?” I’ve always thought that was the meanest example of sitcom misery in television history.

@The_Don_44 @jacktodd46 No. Brady who?
@PoloToCiti @paulsrls Amazing player and person. I chose Henry Aaron. I'll stick with that.
@ddlangley No one. But you can say the exact same thing about Henry Aaron, and I put him on there instead.
@ddubbert Career is still going.
@PaulGehrmann Purposely.
@kenberman He ... is ... not ... retired.
@AlanSpatrick Retired very young. Longevity is one of the criteria.
@gonebeancountin Terrific player. I’ll keep Gordie Howe.
Also: One person per sport. So it’s well and good to scream “Ripken!” Or “Gretzky!” But that means taking Aaron or Howe off. You can do that if you want.
@PKBard @BaseballLiker Put Howe instead. You might disagree. It’s not insane.
Getting SO many grumbles about Brady, Serena, Fed, etc. not being on this list. I thought it was clear that these are perfect CAREERS and those careers are not over yet. https://t.co/UIyI4C5BFJ
Most perfect sports careers for longevity, consistency and integrity (off the top of my head): 5. Jerry Rice 4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  3. Jack Nicklaus 2. Gordie Howe 1. Henry Aaron

Whew! My heart’s racing. Let’s get Maroon 5 out there to take things down a bit.
Lots of people have responded to this by pointing out the Rams first moved out of LA (and going way back Cleveland). Yes. This makes them LESS likable not more. https://t.co/clRXcU6zhk

To all those instinctively saying yes, as a Cleveland Browns fan I reply, “No.”
Wait, you are telling me the Patriots are so odious that we are all supposed to root for a team that abandoned a great city in the grossest imaginable money grab?
@saredsfan44 No. But was Bryant paid fair market value in 2014 when he led the league in touchdown receptions?
@MRedcross Probably not.
@castrovince @richardjustice Is that a mailbox emoji? Are we supposed to send you questions by post?
@blair_houghton At age 56? Probably not.
I know Jon is staunch, but the video actually proves exactly the opposite point. There is a 0 percent chance that Clemens is doing PEDs now, and he’s still throwing that curve. https://t.co/FaKiiDd3IJ
How in the world have we missed out on this? Not getting to see Tony Gwynn do this is now one of the great regrets of my life. https://t.co/dhXROIlfRJ
Amazing. Add in the QB, the kicker, the coach, nine HOFs... and I still think one the most overlooked Hall of Famers ever was on that Chiefs team: Otis Taylor. https://t.co/7xITcQau2L
Disqualifying. https://t.co/vgOzJAV7HG
@FarBeyndDrvn625 @pcriley @stefanbackstrom @ItsThatBriGuy Hate to tell you, MegaMillions won't be enough to buy a team.
@jasongay It's probably not binary, no. That's a good point.  imagine in an open-ended question, people would always say they don't like the owners or the players. But it's always stunning to me to see how anti-player people get when the negotiations rage on.
@GaCuBa No. The owners have an antitrust exemption that prevents baseball from being anything resembling a free market.
@pcriley @stefanbackstrom @ItsThatBriGuy OK, I buy this argument. I really do. You're saying that you have a 0.0% chance of being a pro athlete and a 0.000000000001% chance of becoming an owner, but that slight difference matters to you. That's cool with me.
@pcriley @stefanbackstrom @ItsThatBriGuy And what do you think your percentage chance of becoming an owner is?
@pcriley @stefanbackstrom @ItsThatBriGuy Fair point. 40-something multibillionaires like Mark Cuban are many times more likely to become owners than players. I think all 40-something multibillionaires should sympathize with owners.
Does the market also dictate that cities build stadiums for owners, that owners share money leaguewide, that owners can draft the player and retain exclusive rights for up to 10 years (including minors), preventing any and all movement? https://t.co/dyp4Muu6Ll
@paulbenick77 Does the market also dictate that cities build stadiums for owners, that owners share money leaguewide and that owners have six years of control for players, preventing any and all movement?
@magriffin2 I fear that will be a long wait.
@TakaoYamadaDeY There certainly could be something here but history shows that fans have ALWAYS chosen owners over players. This was even true when owners held all the cards.
@pcriley @ItsThatBriGuy Sure. There's a 0 percent chance that a 45 year old accountant will play. There's also a 0 percent chance that a 45-year-old accountant will ever own a team. How would that even happen?
@jaycaspiankang Exactly. History suggests fans were never sympathetic to players, even when owners held all the cards. They booed DiMaggio for holding out.
@pcriley @ItsThatBriGuy If you're a 45-year-old accountant, your chances of becoming an MLB/NFL/NBA owner are roughly the same as becoming Yankee centerfielder, Chiefs running back or Lakers point guard.
@jaycaspiankang Probably quite a bit, right? We are in a time where many more people play owner/GM than play the sports themselves.
This is a good point and one that I probably have not given enough thought to, this sense that people sympathize with owners because, in a small way, we feel like we ARE owners of our teams. https://t.co/9f12z5Mn2z
@ItsThatBriGuy This is the funny part — fans are roughly 200 times more likely to become a player than an owner.
The fact so many fans sympathize with owners is one of the most baffling things in sports. https://t.co/AWf0ghNeMa

I feel like I never get to make any music recs because I am so old ... but have you heard @badmovesDC? Just awesome.
Tomorrow's inductee into the Happiness Hall of Fame, well, unlike today, you will know him. Everyone knows him. And he knows everything.
@paperfisherman @sepinwall Me too!
@sepinwall Eh. Not feeling it for those who are also Yankees fans.

@schmtty76 Ooh, this is a fantastic guess -- Paul Mokeski absolutely might make the HHOF before this is done.
I'm pleased to say that if I gave you a million guesses, you would not name my Day 2 choice for the Happiness Hall of Fame. If I told you the sport AND gave you initials you wouldn't get it either. This is going to be fun.
OK this is pretty cool ... @TopekaLibrary has picked “Soul of Baseball” as their featured book on #2BookTopeka. So on Feb. 17, I’ll be at the library with my dear friend @nlbmprez to talk some Buck, some writing and some baseball. Come!

For the Babe Ruth poll, I thought I’d using the “plucked out of 1927” line made clear — he DOES NOT get to grow up and train today. You are literally taking him from 1927 — around his peak — and putting him in the big leagues.
@JosiahGorman @mikethegratest I thought this was clear from the “plucked out of 1927” line, but maybe it isn’t. He doesn’t train today. You are taking him right out of his best season.
@alexkapelman Many have tried to make me technologically competent and many have failed. You came closer than anyone else.
What do you think is Babe Ruth’s LIKELY level if you plucked him out of 1927 and put him in today’s big leagues.

@KyleEngelhardt Fantastic, wonderful player, Javy. One of my favorites. Has played more second than short. And Lindor has played at MVP level the last four years.
@StannyLeroy Well, the question was about shortstops. Mookie's crazy good.
@insanebearman Oh, I apologize, you were replaying to a different tweet than I thought. Yes, Albert is one of the greatest players in baseball history.
@Vic_Issitudes I don't think so, not for this question. Correa is fantastic hitter, but he can't run or field with Lindor, not even close.
@insanebearman At shortstop?
The young A-Rod -- PEDs aside -- was the best I ever saw offensively, defensively, speed, the whole package. Ripken was incredible. I was lucky enough to see Barry Larkin just about every day in 1994-95, and he did everything well. I wonder where Lindor will fit in historically. https://t.co/W4mA135w6B

I'll give you five in my lifetime -- 1977 or so on. These aren't the five BEST players but they're five who were so awesome in every way that I'd just put 'em right in: Rickey, Ripken, Maddux, Pedro, Beltre. There are others. https://t.co/B4jSgEDoR7
This is an absolute joy. I say we wave the stupid five years and put Adrian Beltre in the Hall of Fame right now. And then in 2024, we put him in again. https://t.co/MlShQcj1gR

@mitchellichtman @Cran_Boy But, could you not argue that for a sport as messy as the NFL it is not luck itself that you are trying to eliminate but the PERCEPTION of luck? In other words, the perception that a coin flip is an unfair advantage in a game of vital importance is the issue.
@MrBrianKenny Not together, though.

Tony Romo just correctly predicted that I would trip over a notepad in my office.
Man, Romo calls every single play before it happens.
At this point shouldn’t they just check in with Jim Nantz occasionally and let Gene Steratore call the game?
Refs so baffled by a play that doesn’t need to be reviewed ...
Is there ever a play that doesn’t need to be reviewed?
Football is ridiculous.
Daughters just saw that old GEICO commercial with guy making collect calls. They had absolutely no idea what was going on.
@jacknowland Worked out just like that.
What a terrible timeout by the Chiefs there. What made them believe they could stop the Patriots in 3rd and 4?
That no call was so bad that every single time they show a replay, it gets worse. I'm now thinking it was the worst no call in NFL playoff history.
That no call was so bad, if I was the Saints I'd hold and pass interfere on every pass from here on in.
OK, that's the worst no call I've seen in quite some time.

Wait, are you saying that @briankoppelman went deeper and got more to the heart of things than @KenTremendous and I did on the PosCast? ... Yeah, that tracks. https://t.co/4Eymdg3cyn
After his partner turned him down, how much did Eddie Money get for two tickets to paradise on StubHub?
On the PosCast this week, @KenTremendous and I talk nonsense with @tommytomlinson, whose amazing book "The Elephant in the Room" comes out in one week. We recommend you preordering one each day until then. https://t.co/horCILJy4N
I woke up to a birthday greeting from Team Snapchat ... Is a thing I never expected a 52-year old version of myself to say.
@dgreenstone THIS is true.
What moves slower than a college football clock? This is a rhetorical question because the answer is "nothing."
Twitter question for you: how small would NFL rosters have to be for teams to NOT carry a kicker? How about a punter?
This is the first full college football game I've watched all year but unless the rules have changed -- and maybe they have because I still haven't figured out this fair catch thing -- this doesn't seem possible. https://t.co/LnmtfFiN1N
Jeff Bridges lost the plot about nine times in that speech ... and it was great.
Crossbars don’t answer letters.
Funny, watching the games today, I was thinking the same exact thing. These games are pretty boring, let's face it, but the announcers are so into it, so excited about it, and I can't help but think: Where is that energy in October? https://t.co/uoNYaOXxOf

@emmaspan @KenTremendous @tommytomlinson We need you to edit us, Emma.
@ElaineF @KenTremendous @tommytomlinson Thank you for this loving joke ...but you’re 100 percent right. Nobody should have to endure this much PosCast, and certainly not friends.
@KVanValkenburg @KenTremendous @tommytomlinson @EnswellJones Invitation is open ... you know, where you guys actually write a book.
Yeah, so, um, the PosCast is the longest ever as @kentremendous and I bring on the great @tommytomlinson. It's REALLY long. Don't worry. We won't subject you iTunes listeners to the whole thing.
Most people CAN”T change. They face a moment of crisis, that critical instant when they have to decide what to be going forward, and they can’t find something new inside themselves. They write the same story, sing the same song, tell the same joke. They don’t know how else to be.
I am not entirely sure how I ended up writing the following in a story about Roy Halladay and the Hall of Fame, but I do believe it deeply: https://t.co/lMryhoMmZN
In general, how do you feel when you see a crazy, absurd, no-way-that’s-real coincidence in a movie?
Next up on the Hall of Fame Ballot: A guy named Roy Halladay ... and how he transformed himself into a Hall of Famer. https://t.co/lMryhoMmZN
@yanksirish2798 No. It's on Twitter.
@bravesfanstl @parentingonwhls Yes, you can always over-adjust. But I can tell you that in straight ERA Dick Rudolph, Tully Sparks, Jeff Pfeffer, Jack Coombs, Howie Camnitz and Bob Ewing, among many others with 2000 IP had better ERAs than Bob Gibson. ERA+ isn't everything. But it helps give the stat context.
@bravesfanstl @parentingonwhls OK, David.
Same. I am amazed and awed by those who knew they were going to become writers when you were young ... and amazed and awed by young people who know they will become writers. https://t.co/6mIZIJgDPY
@bravesfanstl @parentingonwhls Alcides Escobar has more home runs than Ozzie Smith. So you can discredit that stat too.
Super proud to announce that because of your kindness and devotion to your hot fruit T-shirt values, @KenTremendous and I are donating $3,000 to the @CrohnsColitisFn and $2,000 to @theIRC. You will notice that the higher number is my charity -- because Fruit Pie is Delicious!
@ErikLundegaard If she hadn't known that Brian SIpe was the third quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards, our lives would have been very different.

@jrjones1985 I like it!
Petty, Dale Sr. or Jimmie?
@DougrasTHEChen @tangotiger I think that would be in the 1990+ column.
@tiffanyleigh I say yes.
@dctoubab Yes.
@BissetteDW Yes.
@JayCoffinGC OK, you're right.
Jack, or Tiger?
@AlenaSmithee You found it!
@sepinwall OK, just for you: Brunner or Manning?
Pele, or Messi?
Howe, or Crosby
Montana, or Brady?
Ruth, or Trout?
@billjamesonline I am doing this exact same poll, curious to see if the results are reflective of your followers or of Twitter in general.
Michael, or Lebron?
@ScottMichaux Yes. But I was there first.
@ScottMichaux I hope you're right. I'm sure you're wrong.
Hello, I'm a sportswriter in a movie. I haven't written a word in years, but you can see me in the press box drinking and cracking wise occasionally. Mostly, though, I hang out with athletes and owners, and I can get the best tickets for anyone I want. https://t.co/1cOMpNNF8o
@ScottMichaux I'm sorry. What happened again?
@jamentex @ScottMichaux Hoper, yes. Believer, no.
@ScottMichaux You are just going to keep falling for this, aren’t you?
OK, the story of how @SteveHofstetter and his brother inherited this baseball signed by Roy Campanella and Boys of Summer Dodgers is absolutely beautiful. And now they're GIVING THE BALL to @nlbmprez to display. Amazing. Go to the museum Monday to hear all about it. https://t.co/0A4aDeO0Po
@RyanJLind No, it's going. We're in Hall of Fame limbo. Writing an essay on every player on the Hall of Fame ballot takes up a lot of time.

In this week’s Brown’s Diary I write mostly about Nick Chubb, who I believe is the first player in NFL history to go over 1,000 yards, go back under, then go BACK over 1,000 yards, then go back under again and finally finish the season short of 1,000.  https://t.co/B4J2XU0L1Q
@ariwercz Good point.
@stgoldst No, it’s easy to forget that we used to cheer without hesitation when a touchdown was scored. And now, we wait for the appeal process.
You know what’s especially great about this? All of these are TOUCHDOWNS. They have been reviewed already. It’s easy to forget how much replay review has taken away the instant joy of seeing something happen. https://t.co/fkco7RTKSk
@SpencerFordin @KVanValkenburg No disagreement. He stunk. LJ is a hundred times better in my  view. I’m just saying that people have absurdly strong — very angry — feelings about quarterbacks who don’t conform to a certain image.
This headline from the Bengals team site is a good reminder — no team in sports is like the Cincinnati Bengals. I’m not saying they WILL hire Hue Jackson now. I’m just saying they might. https://t.co/2v30DpscIC

@KVanValkenburg Though, to be fair, I can think of another former Heisman Trophy winner/first-round pick who could really run, who had his accuracy questioned repeatedly, who led a team to the playoffs and who was criticized a lot (though he seemed to have more supporters).

@JoeNeidhard @NotMrTibbs Yes.
@jennifercarolyn I think we're now getting at it. You're viewing it as the big sister. And I'm viewing it as the sappy Dad who would always hope that my oldest daughter would, in the end, take care of my youngest. So you're probably right.
@2xAught7 This is not true, and it cannot be true, and it should not be true. @BMcCarthy32
OK, seriously, how awesome is this? https://t.co/cXWOMrpaBf
@jennifercarolyn True. But the pitcher was also not Ripken's older brother with so many deep and swirling connections. Still, you might have me convinced.
@jennifercarolyn Also fair. There's a question I think about a lot: Did the pitcher groove a pitch to an aging Cal Ripken in the All-Star Game so he could have a final grand moment on the stage? I think yes, and I think it was great because it was bigger than the game.
@jennifercarolyn Fair point. Added a paragraph in there for you because you're right, I don't think I got across exactly what I was trying to say.

@billjamesonline Totally agree.
@Bencjacobs Yeah, that's not close.
@bookends_ny @baseballhall Not editorializing. Ted's no vote was at the center of the Mazeroski debate in all the papers. And thank you.
... such as how he was a great teammate, how he had a great swing, how he was the guy you wanted at the plate, how he was a metronome of consistency ... than deceptive "more career RBIs than blank" arguments.
Schmidt led the league in RBIs 4 times. Baines led the league 0 times. Schmidt drove in 100 RBIs 9 times. Baines did it 3. Baines got 1,500 more at-bats than Schmidt and played in a higher run-scoring environment. I strongly prefer specious holistic arguments for Baines ...
I don't think the big problem with this line of thinking is that RBIs is team-dependent, right? The problem of saying that Harold Baines has more career RBIs than Mike Schmidt is that you're suggesting that Baines was better at driving in runs than Schmidt, which is ludicrous. https://t.co/w9IHjKsxHt

The PosCast Holliday Draft ... has happened. And oh what a draft it was.
@DrBradBarbee It is neither of those things.
Harold Baines. Harold Baines? Harold Baines. Let's talk about what it means. https://t.co/1NJPM064FA
@evilunicorn27 @nlbmprez @baseballhall Did not sign him, but did help save his career — one of my favorite Buck stories.
@JohnSiegmund @baseballhall They also had future Cy Young and MVP Willie Hernandez on that staff.
I'll tell you another terrific thing about today: Harold Baines getting elected means that Ted Simmons and @DaleMurphy3 should have a great chance next year. Maybe Dwight Evans and Lou Whitaker too?
A great thing about Lee Smith getting elected to the @baseballhall -- he becomes the third player signed by Buck O'Neil (along with Ernie Banks and Lou Brock) to get to Cooperstown.
Oh, we're going to have a good time on the live stream at 9 p.m. talking about the Today's Game Hall of Fame ballot. https://t.co/mRcyIizz0I
And warning shots have been fired. https://t.co/3KjyRITxUQ
Going to try something tonight -- it's just a test. Going to do a little Hall of Fame live stream at 9 p.m. (assuming I figure out the technology, which is a 15% chance at best). Would love to see you there.  https://t.co/mRcyIizz0I via @YouTube
Thanks John! https://t.co/E9MzpQjyud
And here is the last of the 10 essays I wrote for the @baseballhall Today's Game ballot -- and probably my favorite one. Here's George Steinbrenner! https://t.co/IPS00kTV9D
I would like to turn my life over to @DarcyCarden and just be a Janet.
So ...
I went off the deep end for this Lee Smith essay -- the ninth of the 10 essays celebrating the Today's Game @baseballhall ballot. I regret nothing. https://t.co/bts25Dap2m
We're flooding the zone in order to get all ten "Today's Game" @baseballhall essays in before Sunday's announcement. Here's our eighth essay on Sweet Lou Piniella (with highlights of the game where he made an out at every base)! https://t.co/pdI7wdMJ7M
Here's our seventh essay of people on the Today's Game Ballot -- every one of these has been fun, but sure, there's a special kind of fun when you're writing about ol' Charlie Manuel. https://t.co/jQcKX9Bp42
I've avoided this for 50 years. Should I finally read The Lord of the Rings?
Next up on in our essays about all 10 people on the @baseballhall Today's Game Ballot: Davey Johnson! I reminisce about Davey's Reds in 1995, one of the strangest baseball seasons I know about. https://t.co/p0G0OjfA1U
Do you need another reason to love Gary? OK, here's another reason. https://t.co/rs3VhgtLtd
We're halfway through our 10 essays of the players on the Today's Game @baseballhall ballot. Let's see, we've done Baines, Belle, Carter and Clark. Next up: a terrific one, Bulldog, Orel Hershiser. https://t.co/diJ5etNtVI
Fun ⁦@PassionsAmerica⁩ piece on ⁦@TedLeonsis⁩ and his start mowing lawns. https://t.co/e1M7EJjV4B
@AlexaDatt @netflix Have you heard of this show called, I think it’s “Friends?” It’s like about some friends who hang out and stuff and mostly end up sleeping with each other, really cool.
The greatest. https://t.co/zpFmM13at2
VERY excited about this new stat. https://t.co/bebGDRmJ8R
As I look at the 20 (TWENTY!) new players on this year's @baseballhall ballot, I can't help but think: They're just doing this to break me, aren't they?
@ChrisW802 He will get another chance.
@ctownlaw Nate, you don't have to tell me about Quiz, I've written roughly 1,483,459 pieces about his Hall of Fame case. But the request was for players who have not been considered by the veteran's committee.
You know I love my friend @DaleMurphy3 but the request was for players who have not been considered by the veteran's committees. https://t.co/VZOfysGHsg
Lou Whitaker. Kenny Lofton. Dwight Evans. David Cone. Graig Nettles. To start. https://t.co/kbj6pWhSHi
We're writing essays on all ten people on the Today's Game Ballot and next on the list, an all-time favorite: Sweet-swinging Will Clark. https://t.co/drLovZQDQB
@CharlesPPierce Not. Yet. They're talking about it.
I hope Rob Manfred and MLB builds off the audacity and momentum necessary to make a big change like eliminating the shift and then uses that do something that would actually help the game.
@lindaholmes @C_GraceT Whoa, I just started my new Bullet Journal on the Leuchtterm1917. Have I made a mistake?
How anyone ever hits a major league pitcher is beyond me. https://t.co/VX79h8WFwJ
As you might know, we're doing essays this week on all 10 of the people on the Today's Game Hall of Fame ballot. First up today, the Ruler or Ribbies, Joe Carter! https://t.co/IyC2WDAE54
Is it @jk_rowling? @susanorlean? @rayadverb? @Jpdabrams? @Lin_Manuel? @lindaholmes? @sepinwall? Come on, stop the suspense already.*  *Tommy's book "The Elephant in the Room" comes out next month and it is beyond fantastic. https://t.co/0zC4tFWVlL
@CharlesPPierce @BMcCarthy32 I'm frankly stunned you didn't go with the Loreena McKennitt version Charlie.
He's right. And yet @BMcCarthy32 took Christmas in Sarajevo. This is your alert. The PosCast Holiday Draft is coming ... https://t.co/u4DlkD2oq1
Sorry. This isn't political. This is just plain one of the funniest things I've ever seen. https://t.co/XPa7GkjPds
I have an amazing office upstairs with great light, lots of room, all my books and stuff. And we have a dark, closet-sized room off the the bathroom. Which room do you think I use most for writing?
We are rolling with our essays on the Today's Game Era Ballot: Second on the list, this was a fun one, it's Albert Belle! https://t.co/1Y4LhnulGC
OK, this is the last you will hear about this (probably): Two hours left to buy an adult PosCast Pie shirt for charity. @kentremendous proceeds to @theIRC; mine to the @CrohnsColitisFn. Kids' sizes available on demand. Hurry! https://t.co/Fb51H6HImc
Is it even slightly possible that the first ever PosCast Favorite Player Matt Szczur could be any cooler? No. It is not possible. https://t.co/Lhw6ILetx9
@billjamesonline @tangotiger Well, wait, I hear KitKat's are different in Europe than in America.
And our series on the Today's Game Era Hall of Fame ballot begins right now ... with professional hitter Harold Baines! https://t.co/yASt2SUtM3
@HeavyJ28 That logic doesn't work, you're right. But I'm not following the logic you're using.
@craigdhooten To be fair, through age 33: 1. Bonds 99.9 WAR; Griffey 78.7 WAR. 2. Bonds 164 OPS+; Griffey 145 OPS+ 3. Bonds 445 stolen bases; Griffey 177 SBs. 4. Bonds made 300 fewer outs and created 100+ more runs.
Awesomeness https://t.co/g8opqxOkIK
And the follow-up poll. Let’s say that NOBODY in baseball used steroids. The testing was so rigid and complete that nobody could have gotten away with it. Who would have been the best player of the 1990s-2000s.
@scottsegrin Yep. That’s next.
@Brannon521 Similar.
A poll: Let’s say PEDs had been perfectly legal in baseball and everyone used them. Who would have been the best baseball player of the 1990s-2000s?
Now that's a cake! Did I mention I'm writing a book called "The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini" ... and it just so happens that John is a featured character! https://t.co/AG94Aa7nLF https://t.co/tbTHsVjfia
@The_GGBoom Better than 50 times original price, I guess.
@bubbaprog True. But it's not 6,000 pounds.

A lot going on, but don't want to let this slip through the cracks: Today is the last day to buy a PosCast Great Fruit Debate T-shirt. For charity! My shirt is rightfully crushing @KenTremendous' shirt, but there's still time for you hot-fruit haters. https://t.co/Fb51H6HImc
@mbeck35 Ohio State basketball coach.
@HumphreyTrey Did you think that Tweet was intended to say Ohio State belongs in the college football playoff?
This year's "Today's Game Era Ballot" is a reminder that, no matter where you might be in the argument, the Steroid Seven are not getting into the Baseball Hall of Fame for a long, long, long time. https://t.co/KbJMdHVjtn

Just a reminder that, as @KenTremendous often says, “Fruit pie is delicious.” https://t.co/Fb51H6HImc
@PurpleHatKid The player by player will be on the blog, but there will be some Hall of Fame stuff at The Athletic as well.
All punter penalties should just be roughing the kicker.
So, wait, have people who watch college football had to endure these Fansville commercials all year?

@tsutton94 This is exactly the point of the poll -- to ask the question of just how hard Mike Elias' job is going to be. Is he trying to turn around a fundamentally sound franchise that had a bad year, or a moribund franchise with bad ownership that has lost its fan base.
@tomsaurer Exactly!
I can’t believe it’s come to this but it should be asked: Are the Baltimore Orioles the worst franchise in professional sports?
Wow, to have Soul mentioned by heroes @MattTheE AND @Nick_Offerman ... just $2.99 on Amazon for a limited time! https://t.co/aZsRyL6EcZ
@KenTremendous @EdFelten On this, Mike is correct and I think we actually deserve an A+ and for you to name one of the halls at Princeton after us.
@sepinwall Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses.
@sepinwall That's great. You're dead to me.
John Bailey will not allow your anger to hurt him @KenTremendous. https://t.co/KqhgRV8ggI
Fixing link: If you haven't been following @KenTremendous' anti-pie screed on Twitter ... good, it's ridiculous, instead enjoy fruit pie, one of the most delicious things in a challenging world. Oh, and you can buy a T-shirt celebrating pie for charity. https://t.co/Fb51H6HImc
@StofCircumstanc @KenTremendous No. We do not respect his viewpoint on this at all.
Found a quirky stat about the 85th-best player in MLB history, Ivan Rodriguez, and followed it down the rabbit hole. https://t.co/O7n3NPgWsH
@sepinwall @KenTremendous @kumailn Sigh. It’s clear that rooting for the Knicks for so long has hurt you badly, Alan.
@kumailn @KenTremendous Heartbreaking, Kumail. Just heartbreaking.
@BobVorwald @BMcCarthy32 I will not hear a bad word about Elf Foreman, Bob.
OK, I’m giving away a free “Fruit Pie is Delicious” T-shirt to the person who (how about this for a twist) does the best job recommending ANOTHER person who deserves a free Fruit Pie is Delicious T-shirt. But you only get one Tweet to explain.
What Mike is saying here is buy a T-shirt for charity and also, secretly, fruit pie is delicious. https://t.co/qNai26PYgj https://t.co/gJVv78nzz4
Oh, and I should add -- we are asking for suggestions for the big, star-studded Holiday PosCast draft. Last year, you might recall, we drafted Christmas songs. Looking for something just as fun this year so @BMcCarthy32 can once again win a place in everybody's heart.
The bonus PosCast -- where @KenTremendous compares himself to Galileo for his bold fruit stance -- is up. We talk Browns and Mets, but mainly remind you of the cool T-shirts we are selling for charity, with mine ("Fruit Pie is Delicious") being cooler.  https://t.co/Fb51H6HImc
Well, this is pretty crazy. https://t.co/PoFGa2vn5n
@llcamp @TheAthletic @Browns Yeah, I don’t understand craps.

@KVanValkenburg As long as you don't have Christmas in Sarajevo on your list.
There goes my afternoon. https://t.co/XjxrLJ5pEf
Our tidy little "bonus" PosCast went one hour and 1:15 because @KenTremendous and I cannot shut up. Dropping soon.
No. 86 in the Shadowball 100: I think Jackie Robinson's 1947 season is the most important in baseball history. And I'm pretty sure Larry Doby's 1948 is the second most important. https://t.co/dBsAY16EkL
Bonus PosCasting with @KenTremendous in a few minutes -- last chance to get in your questions.
@JeffHeckelman How many times in your life as a Mets fan have you said those exact words in that exact order?

Wrote about my Harry Potter Diet. Question for Twitterland: Have you done this windowing thing, eating in an eight-hour window every day? I'm doing it, and I think it's helping, but I'm curious if others have found it successful or a fad. https://t.co/P0ZKLjLahx
@MgKoehler Not missing any points. Just asking the question.
Let’s do a different poll. Let’s say a player today — in this new environment with baseball more open to gambling — always plays his hardest and also has a standing bet on his team to win every game. What should be the punishment?
The logic of this poll is tortured — Rose knew what he was doing — BUT the point that Baseball was so high and mighty about being anti-gambling until like two weeks ago when the owners saw how to line their own pockets with it is not without merit. https://t.co/mgi1oEPKwC
So, I’ve been on The Harry Potter Diet for six months. Here is what I have learned (so far). https://t.co/P0ZKLjLahx

The 86th best player in Major League history: Ryne Sandberg. Let's talk a bit about that trade that brought him to Chicago. https://t.co/Av5Owmsfic

Angelica ... Eliza ...
💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰 https://t.co/Y3DIeLJJ3G
Having just written on JoeBlogs about the hilariously awful trade that brought Ryne Sandberg to Chicago, I am now convinced that if @KenTremendous and I had run a baseball team in the 1970s and 1980s, we'd be in the Hall of Fame right now.
Writing about the 86th best player in MLB history, Ryne Sandberg (and the hilarious trade that brought him to Chicago). https://t.co/Av5Owmsfic
@minakimes @KenTremendous I think in the long history of Twitter this is the greatest correction ever.
This might sound mean but ... It is SO much more fun when Hue Jackson is on the other sideline.
Well, Jeff Fisher is still the ultimate, no? https://t.co/os8A6B6WKB
As a Browns fan, I don’t quite know how to deal with what I’m seeing.
What must it be like for Hue Jackson to watch the Browns absolutely torch his Bengals defense?
When writing my book on Houdini, I read everything Ricky Jay wrote and watched every video of him available over and over again. I’m not sure this directly helped me write the book but I just wanted to get a little closer to magic. RIP Ricky Jay.
Just opened my daughter’s world by playing the atrocity “The Girl is Mine” for her. She is appropriately horrified.
1. Turn on Ohio State-Michigan game. 2. Watch Ohio State drive right down the field passing ball. 3. Watch Ohio State for no apparent reason put in some backup quarterback to run 3 ineffective run plays up the middle to settle for field goal. 4. Turn off Ohio State-Michigan game.
Funny, sweet and did amazing impressions of absolutely everyone. World is a little bit less joyful today. RIP Gresh . https://t.co/rNtSs97iJf

@KevinCarter42 @larryjamad @nlbmprez @TeresaOutward Astonishing that you would list these 10 and not actually even include the greatest pitcher of all time.
I am gifting a "Fruit pie is delicious shirt" to @Lin_Manuel because of his awesomeness and because Hamilton is the fruit pie of musicals. Ten days left, to choose sides in the great fruit pie war between @KenTremendous and me. Oh, and it's for charity. https://t.co/5o8I4tssrC

There ain’t no mountain high enough and ain’t no river wide enough, but if the valley is super low I could see that being a problem.

Also, @KenTremendous and I are selling T-shirts for charity. Well, really, we're selling T-shirts to prove, once and for all, whether fruit pie is delicious OR hot fruit is disgusting. So, really for world domination.  But the money goes to charity. https://t.co/Wm2hSLMoRE

If — and I’m just saying IF — we sold a holiday T-shirt with proceeds for charity, what T-shirt topic would you be most likely to buy? (No need to respond “none” as that is the default choice).
@billjamesonline Agree 100%. But baby steps do move us forward.
@KeithOlbermann Or that he led the league in strikeouts, f-WAR and a bunch of other stuff that nobody appreciated in 1996.
@s3friedman Maybe, but the “diminishing peripherals” you talk about were not at all. He led the league in a bunch of stuff including strikeouts and Fangraphs WAR in 1996. If he’d had that season in 2018, he would have gotten serious Cy Young consideration rather than a ticket out of town.
Jacob deGrom’s Cy Young Award with a 10-9 record ended many years of overlooking great seasons with lousy won-loss records. Would the Red Sox have so cavalierly discarded Roger Clemens if they knew then what we know now? https://t.co/lvqboEeC0S

That ended up being the best @Browns performance in five years. Color me confused and happy.
I will say — Baker Mayfield is looking absolutely sensational today. It has been a long stretch of pain and I imagine there will plenty more this season, but going forward I’d rather be a @Browns fan than a whole lot of other teams.
@wmkelly1980 @nuggetpalooza With Mayfield 9-for-9 passing, let’s not forget that little tidbit.
@nuggetpalooza I’d have felt differently if it CAME CLOSE to working.
Browns trying to set an NFL record for stupid plays in one game ... why did I start this diary again?
Just three minutes into the game, the @Browns ran the single stupidest play I’ve seen in the NFL this year. So, yay, another week.
Great weekend in KC celebrating Buck O’Neil’s 107th birthday with @nlbmprez. We think about Buck every day in these divided times. A lot of people do. But we can always use more ... https://t.co/GBNLHx69Ak
What a blast hanging out today with @nlbmprez and a shocking number of you at the Negro Leagues Museum to celebrate Buck’s birthday. Soon, going to Gem Theater to celebrate Buck some more with former Royals stars and, yes, The Gap Band. You Dropped The Bomb on Me!
@JeffJacksonNC I once spent two hours in a grocery store explaining time travel in the Harry Potter movies to our youngest daughter. By the time it ended, the cans of beans understood time travel better than she did.
So so good. https://t.co/GomSiJ221E

Wut. No, really. Wut. I'm sorry. Wut. I'm not kidding here. Wut. https://t.co/Ci6v5vJK6k
Back in KC, don’t forget to join ⁦@nlbmprez⁩ and me, 10 am Saturday, for a museum tour and a bunch of Buck stories. Come on, I didn’t come into this absurd cold for nothing. https://t.co/3jV71O4Q9n
Is there some technological way for @twitter to adjust my feed so that I can get old tweets mixed in with new ones in such an illogical and dizzying order that it makes the whole thing a gruesome black abyss of nonsense and confusion and rot and ... oh, wait, you got it. Thanks.
Fair question. I can’t come close to my prime barbecue eating day-in day-out, but like Albert Pujols, if you hang a slider, I still can deposit that thing. https://t.co/M4UGhwoY9R
Stepped outside, felt that cold Kansas City wind slash through me, envisioned that barbecue I will be eating shortly and thought: “Ah, home.”
@KevinR70 Last time I was in Washington, I asked the cab driver to take me to National Airport. He said, "Which one? Reagan?"
@RPMang @TheWWImuseum @TheRieger @ManifestoKC Thank you for this. I have been at all of those places, and they are wonderful.
Band now playing Uptown Funk. People are gathering around. I look around to see how many people are annoyed. Seems like a very small group. Most people seem pretty happy about it.
Oh, I'm on my way to KC -- would love to have you at the Negro Leagues Museum as I join @nlbmprez in a celebration of our friend Buck O'Neil. Tour begins at 10. Conversation to follow. Then later, a really cool Birthday Bash featuring Frank White, Amos Otis and Willie Wilson!
Here at Reagan Airport, a large brass band has just, out of nowhere, started playing "Happy." I suppose this does make me happy.
This is how the Steelers look in my daily Cleveland nightmares. https://t.co/zolbf0bsgc

I'm not really sure why we will keep watching @Browns games the rest of the year but we will. What else can we do? Also a "Why didn't the Browns draft Michael Thomas" screed. This week's Browns diary at @TheAthleticCLE. https://t.co/JqJe0SEXZV

@Tye_KC Oh, he will love it. Totally appropriate. Now, I can't promise that we'll keep his attention the whole time -- having taken 6 year old girls to things like this in the past -- but seeing the statues, walking around, seeing the cool baseball history, he will definitely love it.
I think I actually talked someone into voting. Exciting! He was like, "Nah, I mean, it won't make a difference." I was like, "Please vote so I can tweet that I talked you into voting and feel good about myself." And he said, "OK, fine."
So proud of my friend ... plus a special Rock and Roll Marathon guide inside? That’s a magazine. https://t.co/nRtKqc4ttd

OK, we're going to do this thing: Saturday morning, 10 a.m., @nlbmprez and I will lead a tour of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, and then at 11 we will get together and tell a few Buck O'Neil stories on the Field of Legends. Would love to see you there.

What would lightweight football, with every player lighter than 200 pounds, look like?
@davidaprinz @HockFilms @robneyer True. And the likelihood of the machine being used (which recorded him at 83.1 mph) being entirely accurate is troubling too. But it's what we have. I think there's a reasonable chance that Johnson threw 95+. There's a reasonable chance he'didn't throw 93.
In the superb #Fastball (if I say so myself), @HockFilms had scientists break down the likely speed of Walter Johnson's fastball. Using modern measurements, it came out to 93.8 mph. And he was the phenomenon of his day. I think @robneyer estimate of 85 or less is a good guess. https://t.co/dSZdILsnHv
@BaseballLiker Yes. But this is not the only survey I'm doing.

@ScottMichaux Your sentences contradict each other.

Halloween Candy Elite Eight went according to form other than a mild upset from No. 5 Snickers over No. 4 Twix. And now, it's the Final Four,.
@dspinola2000 @KenTremendous They won the play-in game. Nothing I can do.
@akirby Magical year. Upset DePaul in the conference tournament final.
@Buckeye_Brad Coaches will tell you that you can't worry about the seed, you just have to go out and play.
@hollylaw68 @BMcCarthy32 @KenTremendous What is this, like your fourth tweet? And you used it for STARBURST? Come on.
And, yes, the 1-8 game ... 4/4
The 2-7 game ... 3/4
The 3-6 game ... 2/4
OK, play-in games are complete and it's time for the Elite Eight of Halloween candy. Here is the 4-5 game ... 1/4
@lindaholmes @BMcCarthy32 @KenTremendous From @KenTremendous: "This is why I left Twitter. Abuse."
Let's check in with our analysts: @BMcCarthy32: "Starburst have a very high fun factor. Delicious." @KenTremendous: "Starburst are a gasoline-based plastic toxic nightmare of nausea."
@lindaholmes Agreed. The winner has a No. 1 seed waiting for it.
Oh, I guess I should have mentioned ... I'm doing an Elite Eight Halloween candy bracket starting tonight. First two are just play-in games. The Elite Eight will go up in one hour.
@mimsylou Not yet. I'm doing the bracket on Twitter! First four true matchups coming up in an hour.
@mimsylou Twix is a higher seed, doesn't need to get through the play-in round.
Halloween Candy Play-in game 2.
Halloween Candy Play-in game 1.
@RheaButcher Right, the game itself. The culture is a whole other thing, I fear.

“Do I have time for one more shot at launch angle? Sure.”
@joe_sheehan Well, there was that time when no never.
OK, I’ve been avoiding this all series ... are there really not enough commercial breaks in baseball that they have to shove extras in during the game?
@paullu @joshuajaymagic @JenKramerMagic I heard that too!
You know, pitch framing really is a lot like slight of hand magic. I'll bet my pals @joshuajaymagic and @JenKramerMagic would be awesome at framing pitches.

Great season for the Brewers. This was a bad hitting approach night, though.
@JohnVicain List is not my top four.
@andrewfmertes :)
@mitchellichtman My point is the “Dodgers are winning” and “now the Dodgers won’t have have to worry about Hader later” gripes sound like a whole lot of BS.
@stevenjoshwa And all nine innings count.
Man oh man these announcers are having a cow about Josh Hader coming in early. And their reasons make no sense whatsoever to me.
As long as we are playing ... who would you take if you needed one scoreless inning to go to the World Series?

@Lilkinletitrock @tangotiger @based_ball @mitchellichtman @billjamesonline I agree on the last. I don't agree that the space above the fence is neutral ground though -- I think anything on the field side of the plane is in play, and I think that's the spirit of the rule.
@Lilkinletitrock @tangotiger @based_ball @mitchellichtman @billjamesonline It doesn't precisely say that, but follow this to its logical conclusion. If a fan reaches over the plane and catches a ball above the fence AND the player's glove, do you think the rule says that's a home run?
@jocokclaw That's right. The fan did exactly what a fan should do and what a fan would involuntarily do. I think anyone who BLAMES the fan is being absurd. But I also think the evidence shows contact was made on the playing side of the fence.

Did I mention that every time I see Jackie Bradley Jr., he looks like a pretty good hitter to me.
Everybody throws 99. Hitters crush. Incredible defense. Red Sox-Astros. How lucky we are to be alive right now.
@sethmnookin Took me that long to come up with a word for it.
That Betts call was ... something.

First you hold, then you get beat, then you make the game-ending tackle, that's not a great defensive play overall.
@MacCambridge It won't be 40-40 for long.
With Tom Goodwin out there, I would have to say it’s the first time in history that a pinch runner — Sandy Leon — is slower than the first base coach.
@kcrowe Was actually about Reflections in a Golden Eye.

I actually love this. I think teams should be more willing to change names. Hammers is a awesome name. https://t.co/Tk0kbQlugC
No. 92 on the Baseball 100 greatest players in Major League Baseball history list is ... Justin Verlander. https://t.co/XX0n2QvWOg
So great. Congratulations Megan. https://t.co/Hx6ZZMfCqJ
Love this but you missed the most obvious choice: the Cleveland Fellers. Homage to the all timer. And they are just a bunch of fellers playin’ ball. https://t.co/n1LyPNKW0X
You know, until this moment I never fully appreciated the evocative irony on Sonny Gray's name. "Tell me of your times," she asked with great hope. "Alas," I said, "they were sunny gray." https://t.co/uu3ISOI2ru
I get it. But this makes me sad. It’s like finding out your hero is not who you thought. https://t.co/ovThPJa4EB
@RealBillyBizzle @jeremylatzke @KenTremendous Understood. It was abrupt. And it was done abruptly. There were reasons for why we did it that way that sort of came last second but ... there’s no doubt I could have, with proper planning, handled it better. That’s on me.
The case for ending bad weather. The case for eliminating taxes. The case for lightening gravity so we can jump higher. The case for making cake zero calories. The case ... https://t.co/64YcNlbmZE

@tancona1023 @BMcCarthy32 @KenTremendous @ringer I get what you are saying Tom and appreciate that it was abrupt. And I appreciate you being a loyal listener ... that’s why we are trying to keep the core of the PosCast free.
@eephusasher @Mattant12 @BriFRiley Got that it was satire. Didn't work for me at all.

@kevinpaulconnor @BMcCarthy32 @KenTremendous Can’t blame you for that but can assure you that if there are any membership exclusive PosCasts, that will be for JoeBlogs members. ... And I deeply appreciate you reading. Thank you!
@sepinwall @KenTremendous @BMcCarthy32 True, but I thnk he's just waiting for your next guest spot for that.
@sepinwall @KenTremendous @BMcCarthy32 Wait, did you have a bummer week? What happened? Please share.
All sorts of new options and stuff over at JoeBlogs ... including bonus members-only PosCast stuff, like this week's draft with @BMcCarthy32 and @KenTremendous. Thanks for being a member! Or Join now! Whichever fits your situation! https://t.co/qVMfircmC3

The story of Jackie Mitchell, the young woman who struck out Babe Ruth ... and how it affected another young woman I know pretty well 75 years later.  https://t.co/yfjRsj2NGv
@iPlayMarioKart That IS the take.
This is a high quality gag. https://t.co/gxAwF887yb
@mitchellichtman Well, I’m on pins and needles here ...
Got a huge kick out of TBS showing the Yankees defense and having “2016 Gold Glove” below Brett Gardner. That’s pertinent information right there.
I’ve never really thought about this before but ... why do we want studio people to give us predictions 30 seconds before game starts?
@GlidepathTozero No. But that’s probably my fault.
@GlidepathTozero It must have been because you still don’t get what I’m saying.
I've come to enjoy writing the Shadowball 100 even more than the Baseball 100, which I love. Here's Shadowball 93: Jackie Mitchell. https://t.co/yfjRsj2NGv
Best I can tell, Nick is now 0-34 against analytics, so I might take that into account in future matchups. https://t.co/H93VDtyWdK
@yourbassist Oh. I thought he was the one whose teams went into the tank after he left.
@yourbassist I give up. Which one is Dusty?
@MrMaddness OK.
Interesting: Many people have read this Tweet to mean that I think Tito should be fired. What I mean is the exact opposite. https://t.co/UnIgbd1jX1
@gmarloweyo That's EXACTLY why it's the greatest example.
@KenCarman Yes, that's right.
I love Tito. But this is a good reminder -- in six season from 2010-2017, Dusty Baker averaged 92 wins per year. He was fired twice. https://t.co/Ff0TfudX8v
Five more innings to root for close plays at first! https://t.co/IGNFcau3mK
Can we have an in-game interview with Angel Hernandez?
Going over Lance Lynn thing with a friend — we think he was pregame first-out-of-bullpen guy if Severino struggled, which makes sense. But we can’t get why he didn’t START the inning, why plan didn’t change with bases loaded or why Chad Green was up one second after Lynn came in.
Was there ANYONE who thought that Lance Lynn thing would work?
If Angel Hernandez takes the red pill, you might want to take the blue.
@mitchellichtman I have no doubt this is true. But it’s annoying to watch Lindor bunt with two men on base.
What's my opinion on Kingman's performance? What the $#%$ do you think is my opinion of Kingman's performance, Dave? https://t.co/mqkzeckeVA
1. Sign on to Twitter. 2. See this. 3. Start to cry. https://t.co/Bxl2MDqGEX
Awesome to see Francisco Lindor unload on pitch. Might have been nice if he tried for that instead of bunting with two men on.

I’ve come to think most sports announcers are like most bands. They will have a decent first album. But they quickly run out of things to say.

That field goal was so worthy of the @Browns first Sunday win since 2015z
Hey hey, look what just arrived. https://t.co/ED4mS6Dm8N
I don’t say this often because, you know, I’m usually beating @KenTremendous in drafts. But I am lucky and proud to be his friend. And we are all lucky and proud that he and his amazing writers and actors and team give us a good place to go. https://t.co/fAuFaFB8jY

What’s the story with the old Atari graphics to show speed of pitches on TBS?
At one point @KenTremendous and I thought about drafting “horrific ways the Oakland A’s will lose to the Yankees in the wildcard game.” But we stopped at 8 different ways.
No. 94 on the Shadowball 100 is the inimitable Johnny Damon. https://t.co/HlK8kgDWEl
@_DougBowman That’s right. Try them all. Whatever works.
You know how hard it is to destroy a horcrux? Managers should use that same technique to destroy their Manager of the Year awards. https://t.co/T8dX4ziyXt
No matter how many times they call this the “longest wildcard game in history.” I remain unimpressed by the feat.
Some people argue for a best of three wildcard. Rockies and Cubs trying to give that to us.
I know that I’m one of countless people who are there for you Jason in any and every way we can be. https://t.co/VkudkgcFXe

They’re more fun. But they’re still the @Browns
@DaniWex Eerie
@DaniWex Eerie.
@lindaholmes @sepinwall @mattzollerseitz I also like the “I disagree because THIS” responses where THIS is exactly what you are saying.
@sepinwall @mattzollerseitz Could you summarize what he said after “death?”
@cudaman11 Different system. A better idea one, I hope.
No. 94 on the Baseball 100: The great Tony Gwynn. https://t.co/1wFo7msSom
The 94th best player in Major League Baseball history is ... Tony Gwynn. And as part of the celebration, believe it or not, I write an ode to batting average. https://t.co/1wFo7msSom
@AndrewMLogue All sides.
@HenryMyers7 if he's innocent, yes.
OK, I'm in. This is disgraceful. Absolutely disgraceful. She has spoken and written about the challenges of growing up with an alcoholic father, and how once she found the word "DRUNK!" carved into her high school locker after her father's multiple DWIs. https://t.co/seNk1gQ9Ks

@JeffFletcherOCR @mike_petriello Absolutely. Both super deserving. But Mike is right in that Trout is probably not going to finish in top 3 because of team losing.
@mike_petriello Totally agree. I just think this year there is actually a player on Trout’s level ... something we don’t often see.
I love both Mikes — Trout and Petriello — but is Trout really going to lose the MVP because his team is bad? I think you could make a pretty compelling case that Betts is every bit as good this year and maybe a hair better. https://t.co/mXLQ8d3zQc

@sepinwall Yeah, I think as a purely crafted joke, it's a touch better. But they're both pretty perfect. So is Rick coming to Casablanca for the waters.
Gross and unforgivable. Now, if it was St. Louis pizza ... (I see you @DaniWex). https://t.co/BcMfa6DhsD
This week's PosCast with @KenTremendous has my favorite draft ever. We also do a lot of segments. On @ApplePodcasts @Stitcher @audioBoom and all those places. https://t.co/XAiwT0zsQn
The NFL roughing-the-passer rule is out of control.  The way quarterbacks get hurt in the NFL is out of control.  These kneeling quarterbacks in the NFL are out of control.  GEICO. 15 minutes will save you 15 percent in car insurance.
I'm proud to say that this week's PosCast, which drops in the morning, is both meaningless and has various sound issues. Our listeners expect nothing less.
@lindaholmes I hear there is a book about Houdini coming out.
@Nic_Leigh Oh yes. Diary is over at @TheAthletic
A few words at @TheAthletic on Dellin Betances, his anti-DiMaggio-like strikeout streak and why he just might be the @Yankees key this October. https://t.co/w7zAcA5oU5

I have to say, I love this Shadowball Series at least as much and maybe even more than the Baseball 100. Here's No. 96 -- the great Hilton Smith. (Yes, I see you @nlbmprez). https://t.co/NphoSAhBEn

@dmorey @patrick_hruby @Joelsherman1 Oh, it's probably nonsense. But it's fun!
Expanding on why I strongly disagree with @Joelsherman1 on the idea of baseball losing fans because of new stats, lots of other thoughts, and a kicker from @dmorey. https://t.co/2UNu9EYOSM
“Sure, I have an idea. I will write a Browns diary. That will be fun!”

Awesome conversation on @PassionsAmerica podcast this week with @JasonKander about his passion for baseball, family, solving problems and, yes, Taco Bell. https://t.co/P2NN1eqjvE
No. 96 in Baseball 100 is dropping later today. My guess is a lot of you will REALLY not like it.
@mattgoodman13 @PassionsAmerica @JasonKander Thank you for pointing this out. Hope to have fixed shortly.

A thoroughly underrated observation in the PosCast “Field of Dreams” discussion — Mike’s point that “Doc” Graham gave up eternal baseball bliss to whack a girl on the back because she was choking. They couldn’t have done that themselves?

@lindaholmes @Nick_Offerman You were the only bar we had to clear, if that helps.
With all due respect all the meaninglessness of the past, we just recorded the best ever PosCast -- starring @Nick_Offerman.
@ItsSkylineTime @scottmerkin You can check out anytime you like ...
For JoeBlogs Members: Third installment of the Harry Potter Diet, this time featuring "Time for Timer" -- "Or a peanut butter sandwich any time of day's a treat!" https://t.co/N9vVQt9eC9
@JLong__ @LenKasper That's right. They sent Gary to the DENTIST.

@commish24 @Patreon I just put it up on the Patreon site so that you should be able to see it.
For JoeBlogs members: A temporary solution while we work through our @patreon problems. Thanks for reading. https://t.co/upcJ1Yz0H6
Waiting on @patreon to help me work through all the technical issues; in the meantime JoeBlog posts should be unlocked. https://t.co/4sKNLK7ZJ6
@DamonRutherford @Patreon Arrgh. Thanks for your patience. Working on it.
So, there seems to be some crazy problem with @Patreon, and members are being sent into some sort of crazy loop. I apologize profusely, no idea what the reason is. But for now, the posts are unlocked. Thanks for your patience. https://t.co/eJeSbRtLyt
It is mindblowing: Last night JoeBlogs reached 1,000 members. Thank you so much. Here, I wrote something about our daughter, cheerleading and, yes, @Lin_Manuel. https://t.co/eJeSbRtLyt
@ScottMichaux And?
@Super70sSports I’ll alert the media.
@susanorlean Would you or would you not recommend author reading their own audiobooks?
On cheerleading, the surprises our daughters bring us and @Lin_Manuel. https://t.co/eJeSbRtLyt
@tradingPolitics @vgregorian It’s an inside joke M. Sorry.
@vgregorian Preseason football, Vahe? Really?
A great story ... and one of the coolest nights of my writing life. https://t.co/hl7omrjDuT
“...and there will come a time when you will go to high school football games because your daughter is a cheerleader,” the man said, and I laughed for I was blind to the truth.

@ReallyEly Oh, that is absolutely better than Edge of Tomorrow.
And it begins, @sethmeyers favorite baseball project: The New Baseball 100 stars for JoeBlog members, and wait until you see who No. 100 is. Hint: His name rhymes with Jack Den Key. https://t.co/iDOPYX3W5V
I see lots and lots and lots of people referencing Bob Gibson today after the Acuña thing. I know that Bob HATES this. I've written about this a lot, including just seven months ago. https://t.co/p221wxhAHU

@tfinn141 Not hitting him makes it different, yeah.
SOOOO excited for tonight's Braves game, a brilliant moment for baseball, can't wait to to see if the brilliant Ronald Acuna can keep the streak go ... wait, what's that you say?
Congrats! https://t.co/Pljwv5Nvth

PosCast! Puh-puh-puh-puh PosCast! This week @KenTremendous and I talk about nonsense, discuss Yankees nonsense, check in on Scooter Gennett nonsense, and draft small world improvements, which was nonsense. So another success! Available in many podcast places.
If only the NBA used miniature basketballs and the rim was 8 feet high and everyone in the world was at least a foot shorter than me ...
@iambriansales @KenTremendous Scheduling didn't work out but we do announce the special guest, who will be on next time.
@sepinwall @KenTremendous He deals with you promptly, yes.
Yes, @KenTremendous may be off Twitter. But he’s back on schedule with the PosCast — our continued search for meaninglessness drops tomorrow morning at a podcast filling station near you.
For JoeBlogs members: The second step to the Harry Potter Diet ... Quit Diet Coke. https://t.co/bj27aAmK5J
@DianeFeeney330 @boburnham @eighthgrademov That goes without saying.
@SSAC137 It's coming.
@ToddLubben They were. No doubt. Until the end.
Nobody told me that @boburnham's amazing @eighthgrademov was actually a documentary about being the father of an eighth-grader.
@mitchellichtman Which just makes the silence more amazing.
Brooks Koepka sets PGA scoring record to the quietest large crowd in tournament history.
Hey @nlbmprez, here is a little trip down memory lane. I'll tell the escalator and Buck “trying to pick up the check” story next time. https://t.co/CUS1xH7Cdb

I was there. It’s why I love the Olympics. To watch inspiring people like Jordan when they reach the summit. https://t.co/wSQ4qI6F2V
Two hours of @meganamram puns would be the best PosCast ever. https://t.co/xJdgy6hY6F
Fantastic idea from @Cut4 -- they asked me to pick my favorite Topps card from each year in the 1970s. This will lead to a project I'm working on but for now, enjoy the best cards of the 1970s. https://t.co/ewjvzkTFyl

@cal5k @KVanValkenburg Because it is a museum that relies on the revenue that comes from Hall of Fame weekend. This is a hard time for museums.
I am gobsmacked -- and those of you who know me know how rarely I will pull out that word -- at how many of you have become JoeBlogs members. Thank you. I'll work to make it fun. https://t.co/gpkfGIbaZI
@joetiburzi @KVanValkenburg But you're looking at it only one way. How many times have you been to the Hall of Fame?
@KVanValkenburg This is actually a fascinating topic. On the one hand, the Hall is this public idea. In the other, the Hall cannot afford to have enshrines not show up.
Turns our there really does come a time when we heed a certain call ... https://t.co/G1wXvkPoyn

The fact Tim Wallach had the most hits in Washington Nationals franchise history is so astounding and wonderful that I feel sure if I had been given 10,000,000 guesses I never would have gotten it. https://t.co/w3SEMFlQfk
No American sportscaster has ever had as many huge moments as Bob Costas. And yet ... this one was different. https://t.co/CRDoYnSLo0
It is so much fun to watch the @baseballhall inductees deal with all the overwhelming emotion of the the week. https://t.co/qXzzZmopKJ
@NateSilver538 I think Gooden, Murphy, Saberhagen, Mattingly, Cone, Stie, Parker are all in this conversation. Maris, maybe?
@twollowonfitter Trout goes into the Hall of Fame if he never gets another hit.
@CharlieGilbones A bunch. Dale Murphy. Don Mattingly. Kevin Brown. Dave Stieb. Bret Saberhagen. Dave Parker. Tony Oliva. David Cone. Obviously not even talking about Bonds, Clemens, Sosa, etc.
For this poll, I'm not saying that to be a Hall of Famer you need to be the best in baseball. I'm asking about players who WERE best in baseball -- how long do they have to do that to secure Hall of Fame in your mind?
For previous poll, I'm not saying that to be a Hall of Famer you need to be the best in baseball. I'm asking about players who WERE best in baseball -- how long do they have to do that to secure Hall of Fame in your mind?
@FlagrantFan That's a different question.
How many years should a player be, arguably, the best in baseball before you would consider him a sure Hall of Famer?
How much fun do you think it was to make this movie? https://t.co/x6SzBKdyj2
To be here for the opening of the new @baseballhall theater and the premier of the movie @HockFilms and I did together was my Hall of Fame moment. https://t.co/YfN4PreKDd

@EricStangel And circumstance
If I could sum up our time it is that we have the technology to soar through the air while staying connected to the world through magical WiFi, but nobody has any idea how to get the jetway to roll the last four feet.
Heading to Cooperstown. Our movie — I wrote, @HockFilms directed — premieres in new @baseballhall theater Friday.  Thrilling. Oh yeah, I guess there is a kind of big ceremony this weekend too.
Thanks Pete! https://t.co/lVGqmT7eOX

@werthcorkscrewK Well, that was a manager decision too, wasn't it?
Matt Carpenter had a chance at history. Baseball fans had a chance for an unforgettable moment. Should managers care about that? https://t.co/rqGmXCXoPr
Pulling Carpenter in the sixth inning when he has three homers and two doubles -- three shy of the all-time total bases record -- is at least as bad, probably worse, than pulling a pitcher with a perfect game.
Um, wait, Matt Carpenter has three homers and two doubles in the sixth inning and the Cubs are having position players pitch and they PULLED CARPENTER????????????
Say it with me ... Pitchers 👏 are 👏 better 👏 than 👏 they 👏 have 👏 ever 👏 been. https://t.co/nmsILLsXZi
With all the wheeling and dealing going on, this is the best time to talk about baseball's biggest blockbuster almost-trades. https://t.co/QnfsIeYv2o

At first, I felt guilty sending one of those automatic “Sounds good, thanks!” replies that he app recommends. No more. I now intend for that to be my only reply.
This fortune cookie writer decided to take a chance. https://t.co/2HDQQL1djP
@TheScriddler The problem, in my view, is you are looking at it through one prism. Hitters strike out more because pitchers are insanely good. They have countered by hitting the ball harder than ever.

Here, I introduce my new podcast @PassionsinAmerica. https://t.co/vPDJxLoH6S

@ScottMichaux @TigerWoods I hope you are right. I very much doubt you are right. But I hope.
Sure I see exactly ... no, wait, I actually have no idea what you’re talking about. https://t.co/FzNP0WiwyW
Here's my contrarian position on baseball: Hitters are so absurdly good now that strikeouts and the shift are the only thing keeping the game from becoming an offensive free-for-all. https://t.co/8bXIbSXKM4
Certainly the only ones who would admit it. Welcome! https://t.co/4ryJQQuRvV
See, Dale gets it. https://t.co/KacuR4PYqo

Few things have made me happier on Twitter than watching Bangles fans fight for “Eternal Flame.”
@wormbridgev2 No chance.
How could a group as great as The Bangles record something as terrible as Eternal Flame?
Question for PosCast listeners — was the last episode of May 17 finally pushed through for you on iTunes, Stitcher or wherever you get your PosCasts?
@dgoold But you would not have enjoyed the reaction.
@black_bile That would be a surprise.
The PosCast returns one week from today with all new surprises such as ... all new surprises!
@SarahGrynpas That's exactly what Panelist 5 would say!
@RMAB_Ryan @TheAthleticCBB @kenpomeroy @TheAthleticInk Interesting. Of course, you have now eliminated all comebacks.
Panelist 1: Yes, but he shouldn't be. Panelist 2: No, but he should be. Panelist 3: Can we talk about Omar Vizquel for a minute? Panelist 4: If Barry Bonds gets in I will never step foot in Cooperstown again. https://t.co/fV9KMcyUkG

@paperfisherman In part, no doubt. But the odd results keep coming in.
Aaron Judge is Superman at home, Kryptonite on the road, and everyone seems to think it's because Yankee Stadium is a joke. But Yankee Stadium actually isn't a joke, not for righties. There's something else going on. https://t.co/wvzR7NWkW6

Wearing a @springsteen shirt and MLB hat at @VidCon. People look at me like I’m from the Middle Ages. True.
@ClassicShmosby @TheAthleticBUF It's a fair argument. Losing the North Stars was a definite point I missed.

A few people -- OK, more than a few -- have asked what the heck is going on with the Baseball 100. Well, there's news on that front. https://t.co/70aoHXGmH0
@noahtrister @mitchellichtman Didn’t ask but I assume they would have said yes.
Happy Father’s Day. Here is my favorite thing I’ve written about my Dad ... and @springsteen. https://t.co/SWNOwmVOjn
@mitchellichtman We are just going to disagree on this one. The rule could not be clearer. I also spoke with three USGA rules experts who say they misapplied the rule.
I love talking rules. Phil Mickelson gave me a chance to talk rules. https://t.co/TsCZlPEXLv
@twrath @tangotiger Because it could have been ruled a DQ just as easily.
@tangotiger If it doesn’t go through the windmill, whack it again.
@GlidepathTozero That’s cool. I was so bored watching guys repeatedly miss 20-foot par putts I turned it off but I get a lot of people love it.
@yzest5121 @tangotiger No. He did not know. It was clear by what he said to his partner after he did it it. It was also clear because the committee did not have the rule as they did. They could have used Rule 1-2, determined he was trying to get an advantage, and disqualified him. He got lucky.
@tangotiger I absolutely don’t care about the quote-unquote morality of what Phil did — I thought it was kind of funny — but he absolutely did not know that it was a 2-stroke penalty. It was entirely within the rules to disqualify him, unlike Hack-a-Shack.
I loved this column from my pal Kevin ... and disagreed with every single word. https://t.co/j6MMGe8fLX
@kevinpaulconnor Nah. I thought it was funny, actually. But maybe he should be DQ’d.
@dhenry75 I guess. It’s pretty rare. I find it fascinating.
@JimmyThomasNC I don’t think so. Rule 14-5 specifically says “Ball purposely deflected or stopped by player, partner or caddie — see Rule 1-2.”
@TimmySelenski Exactly.
People who know a lot more about golf can explain to me how Phil did not purposely and deliberately break this rule. https://t.co/4IfSL5NbWq
As punitive as golf is, it’s astounding this is only a 2-stroke penalty. https://t.co/7c7fL9daUz

@BenHoffmanNYT @keithlaw @umbrellaman92 @RickBender12 @robneyer I suspect pitcher wins are ]the big reason why teams waited so long to try innovative pitching strategies early in games like the save is the big reason why closers start the 9th with a three-run or less lead.

@FlemESPN There is only one solution. You go up to campus with your boombox and play as loud as you can, "Take ... these broken wings ... and learn to fly again ... and learn to live so free." You will never hear from them again after that.
@bsmith58 My point is we are at an all time low of balls in play.
Four plate appearances for Bryce Harper. Zero balls in play. Point being if Bryce was my favorite player, and this was my only game of the year, I’d feel cheated. #MoreBallsInPlay
Through five innings of @Nationals baseball, I have seen Bryce Harper bat three times. He has not put a ball in play.

Rafa Nadal has won 45 consecutive SETS on clay. That is all.

So, I was writing about the @Yankees supernatural dominance over the @Twins ... when, what do you know, @KenTremendous decided to pop in. How does he do that?  (The crazy deal to subscribe to The Athletic for $2.99 a month: https://t.co/BzyDpQX1Bq  https://t.co/FelmSWLUkE
We all need a little good news in our lives, so let's go through all 30 teams in baseball, and find some good news (Yes, even for the Reds and Royals). https://t.co/FQGyzFzKFZ
@dhwallickjr I think this is exactly right. I think the previous group made trading down toxic. But if you're not going to take the consensus best defender in the draft or a top QB, you HAVE to trade down, don't you?
I do not know why, if the Browns were not going to take Chubb or one of those QBs with the 4th pick, they didn't trade out of that pick. But among Browns mysteries the last 20 years I guess that one ranks pretty low.
The @Browns should totally take Rosen now.
All they need now is a butcher and a candlestick maker and the resurrection begins.
Yes, @KenTremendous and I knew the @Twins would find a way to lose to the @Yankees again. We knew it. We totally knew it. We have exchanged several shocked and angry texts about it anyway.
You probably did not wake up this morning wondering: “What are the 10 worst no-hitters in baseball history?” Well, don’t wonder no more for here they are, each a story in itself. https://t.co/oGoeoAZxze
Hey, hey, it looks like the @Browns are taking Baker Mayfield with the No. 1 pick overall. I’m not saying my first piece for The Athletic is the reason. I am saying: Yay. https://t.co/54TvboRIx4

@lindaholmes Seriously, what single thing could you do to make this less than the worst idea of the 21st Century? Have it staged in a lion’s den, maybe? Once a show, when no one is expecting it, have a piano drop from the ceiling? Comically timed trap doors?

@NickAlpers BUT AN OUT IS RECORDED ON THE PLAY.
@MissionMariner Nah. An out was recorded on the play.
@NickAlpers Maybe, maybe not. In 1980, George Brett reached on base by error five times. That was the difference between .390 and .400.
@NickAlpers Maybe not. But they're not outs.
Yes, Brian on one of my favorite topics. Look, even if you don't kill the error at least STOP CALLING THE HITTER OUT WHEN HE WAS SAFE. https://t.co/w0F8mtxZ8q
Brandon Belt's crazy 21-pitch at-bat sent me down the rabbit hole to try and find the time Luke Appling fouled off 24-pitches in an at-bat. Did he ever do that? Well, like all good baseball stories, it's complicated. https://t.co/cOcoT9tLpV

@lindaholmes Yep. He does make a sort of “Oh, did I give the puck to the wrong person?” gesture when Connolly whacks the glass. But, seriously, how could you not notice that girl? I would have gone to the concession stand and BOUGHT her a puck.
@lindaholmes There was something about that video that I am surprised people didn’t notice — when she got the puck she turned around and was clearly motioning to someone up higher, NOT the person who gave her the puck. That told me right away that it wasn’t her father playing favorites.
@lindaholmes @derek_del I can tell you I got the I Am A Journalist card so I’m already happy. Full report.

@dbweissman @billjamesonline @tangotiger @joe_sheehan Agree with this only to a point. The consistency of baseball is appealing and teams will always figure out how the game should be played, but I don't want a game with 15 pitchers every night along with nothing but strikeouts and homers. You need a hand on the wheel.
@billjamesonline @tangotiger @joe_sheehan And, sure, how long would it be? Once we have that idea in mind, we work to BUILDING THAT GAME. It’s an interesting way to think about it. 2/2
@billjamesonline @tangotiger @joe_sheehan Just throwing my two cents in ... someone in baseball I respect a lot suggested we should consider, “What is the ideal game?” How many stolen bases would it have? How long would starting pitchers go? How many homers would be hit? How many strikeouts would be average? 1/2

@nprmonkeysee @BMcCarthy32 All this guy is bringing to the table is a beat up glove and a homemade bat. Seriously? This guy made his own bat like he’s Roy Hobbs and I’m supposed to replace my centerfielder with him?
@BMcCarthy32 @ByLukeJohnson Put me in coach.

This thread is priceless. https://t.co/ZJ8ELCHVE6
Great to catch up with Theo Epstein; he was quite upset that in the Negro Leagues draft with @nlbmprez neither of us took Judy Johnson.
@emmaspan These kids today with their rock and roll music and Royals stories.
A little bit about Eric Hosmer and the @Padres effort to turn the corner. https://t.co/PC9MGrpPOI

@nprmonkeysee This is amazing .. but what is “The Return of the King?”
The response to my piece on Dayton Moore has been fascinating -- everything from "He just got lucky" to "He should be commissioner of baseball." https://t.co/MCzCDNEo32
Tebow talk! https://t.co/Qy4dVu1aly
The @Royals may be rebuilding again, but Dayton Moore is more confident than ever that the Royal Way will work again. https://t.co/MCzCDNEo32
While it was so much fun having Mallory on the PosCast, her delusions were a bit off-putting. https://t.co/YIb3JQ6reA
With @KenTremendous on assignment, let's talk a little @Orioles baseball and Harry Potter and draft @nbcthegoodplace place characters with @MalloryRubin on the PosCast! https://t.co/YBGI0wO1Ay
So happy to be at @Padres camp today. Always looking for a reason to write about the Pads. And while I'm here, I want to talk to someone about bringing the brown back.
Following @joe_sheehan great discovery, It is astonishing how few dangerous left-handed hitters are in the American League. https://t.co/UNiOmXDTtq
@sepinwall @KenTremendous @MalloryRubin This will never happen, not ever.
I cannot control how good Mallory is at this but I can promise you I did all I could to bring it down to normal levels of terribleness. https://t.co/wKfnqgoKrx
So @KenTremendous is on assignment this week, which means the PosCast is with the incredible @MalloryRubin. This is way better but it does mean I have to wait a week to freak out with Mike about how Miguel Andujar will apparently hit 10 billion jillion home runs this year.

@susanorlean This is so great! Can you finish mine for me?
Man, @nlbmprez TOTALLY crossed me up by not taking Satchel Paige with the first pick. Totally blew up my draft board.
Oh yeah, Negro Leagues draft with @nlbmprez today. It is SO on. Story should be up late this afternoon. He gets first pick so I have to decide if I want to block that invincible Satchel Paige-Josh Gibson battery. But I can't pass on Oscar Charleston. It is going to be something.

@BillFelber It's a good question. I think Jack would tell you the difference is that they weren't tearing up golf courses then because of the effect of the ball.

As embarrassing as this is, I’m going to self quote because people keep emailing and Tweeting me: This was a cool stat about Aaron’s overall greatness I tweeted because it was his birthday. That is all. I am not comparing Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds. https://t.co/xqBvbBxSWr
@mike_petriello 1. Trout 2. Trout 3. Trout 4. Trout 5. Trout 6. Trout 7. Trout 8. Trout 9. Trout 10. Maybe, um, nah, Trout.
Are there really that many options? I don’t think so. https://t.co/zItYFAmVim
@thorn_john Hi John. Wasn’t trying to compare them as hitters. Was merely showing a cool stat on Hank Aaron’s birthday.
@nprmonkeysee I saw the original Tweet and immediately thought “I’M INCARCERATED, LLOYD!” Then I saw you Tweet that exact phrase and it made me so happy.
@mitchellichtman @AudacityOfHoops @JimSebow I was offering an interesting way to look at Aaron’s amazing career on his birthday, one that went beyond the “real home run king” nonsense I was seeing everywhere. I’m surprised anyone thought it was anything else. But a lot of people did. That’s Twitter.
@BMcCarthy32 @Mrs_McCarthy32 It makes me endlessly happy just knowing that you two are out there having these sorts of conversations every night.
@JSEllenberg Me too!
@JSEllenberg I'll save that for Barry's birthday.
I know it's popular to keep saying Henry Aaron is the "real home run king." But it misses that Aaron was so much more than a home run hitter. If Aaron had hit TWO HUNDRED FEWER HOME RUNS he would still have more total bases than Barry Bonds.
Are you a Houdini? Just answer these simple questions. https://t.co/PMriQBcZFQ
"Most people thought that I was out to, you know, just break Babe Ruth's record. And that was not true. I was out to fulfill my dreams." Happy birthday to the great Henry Aaron.

@kapaya1234 One way to call more strikes ... PUT UMPIRES IN BULLPEN CARS. I’m basically just pushing for bullpen cars no matter what the argument is.
The pace of play problem in baseball s easily solved with two words: Bullpen. Cars. Bring them back, soup them up, give them to everyone on the team. Make each half inning like a NASCAR pit stop.

@SteveEnders8 @robneyer @mike_petriello I agree with this too. But I think the bigger problem for me is the 5% threshold itself; that seems a particularly dumb way to decide if a player should be on the ballot the next year.
@robneyer @mike_petriello Edgar could be an interesting case study. If he comes really close, there are 18 10-man ballots without him on it so far. I don't know what percentage of them had Edgar 11 or 12 on their ballot, but I suppose we might have a case where he's delayed a year because of ballot limit.
@robneyer @mike_petriello I am 100% for expanding the ballots -- even adding an "Ask me again next year" option. But as much as I regret to say it, I suspect the 10-man ballot has not kept anyone from the Hall of Fame.

@95onTheBlack I'm not discounting his amazing defense. I'm saying the list you made and the list I made are equally meaningless. We both just picked an arbitrary point and compared Jones to players he doesn't really compare with.
@Brandon_Warne What I'm saying is that you can make a list to show more or less anything you want.
OK, I want to play. There are 4 players with 400 home runs and a batting average less than .255.  Dave Kingman Darrell Evans Adam Dunn Andruw Jones  The first three were not given almost any Hall of Fame consideration.  This is the problem with stuff like this. https://t.co/hAoWTuHHPI

Next on the Hall ballot: A Chip of the old block. https://t.co/VEvcqUDTup
@castrovince @KenTremendous At 3X is somehow becomes 110 minutes.
Did @KenTremendous and I set a new standard for meaningless babble on this week's PosCast? Hard to say. We gave it our best shot.
Next on the Hall ballot: The hopelessly split jury on Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. https://t.co/NdW3LMDnGc
@nprmonkeysee Good news is you will do that every 3 months after the book comes out forever.
@castrovince I hear his source is someone close to Yu Darvish.
Next on the Hall ballot: Vote yes or vote no, Curt Schilling will infuriate you either way. https://t.co/3yXKoSynSS
@tabithasoren "They" are the win-snatchers. They take because they need wins to survive.
The PosCast has its first positive effect! You got this Catherine. https://t.co/19cGu4fJnW
Watching a 1978 Game of the Week heard Joe Garagiola say this about Jim Dwyer "He's 175 pounds; he doesn't look that big. but I tell you with the weightlifting and these weight programs they have now ..."
Next on the Hall of Fame ballot: An all-time great, Mike Mussina. https://t.co/PNR7r69j7A
@MarkSchremmer dWAR includes positional adjustment, a problem of dWAR -- his specific fielding was excellent.
Next on the Hall ballot: A celebration of another recently turned 51-year-old -- one of the greatest all-around players in baseball history, Larry Walker. https://t.co/FF4ZYhHsLV
To tell you what my family thinks of my maturity level, this is what they got me for my 51st… https://t.co/V6Lc8svYet

That whole Eric Hosmer bidding war? Yeah, I'm not buying it. https://t.co/P4zvC435HI
@DaniWex You are of course very nice, a quality entirely disconnected from your taste in pizza.
@DaniWex @TheEllenShow Who would call you too nice?
@Nick_Offerman @KenTremendous You get prominent mention this week.
While the draft calculations are WAY off, this is ... well ... I don’t even know what to say. https://t.co/E4vlCG794C
When the day began I did not expect it to end with “Standing in line to get a book signed by Danica Patrick.” ... What fathers do for daughters.
So @KenTremendous and I have come up with a new slogan for the PosCast: "Way More Than You Wanted." Here's this week's: https://t.co/vzNvRPwlUT
Someone just asked me what this week's PosCast with @KenTremendous is about. I replied, direct quote, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ... about!"
Next on the @baseballhall ballot: The contentious case of Omar Vizquel. https://t.co/EHER0JqG9e
Per request, here is a one-stop shopping link page for all the @baseballhall ballot stories that I'm writing for @MLB. https://t.co/evuSXLH255
All those questions you have been saving up all year for @KenTremendous  and me, yes, now is the time to finally ask. We'll answer on the PosCast later today.
Next on the @baseballhall ballot: The perpetually underrated Jamie Moyer. https://t.co/hzOpX5FL3l
Next on the @baseballhall ballot — and special for @sethmeyers — the quirky and wonderful Johnny Damon. https://t.co/F6Iu3asf0L
Next on our @baseballhall ballot series: Chris Carpenter and Carlos Zambrano. Which of these guys was better anyway? https://t.co/khYTHeVT3k
The last @Browns Diary of this miraculous season. Whew. https://t.co/09PgTAEg9x
Forty-five years ago, Roberto Clemente died while trying to save lives. He was a hero. He was also an unforgettable baseball player. https://t.co/iH6s8b6VJ0

To vote tactically or to not vote tactically -- that's the Baseball Hall of Fame question. https://t.co/Nr0R7NkBCH
Some call it a waste of time. Others call it a complete waste of time. We call it the PosCast holiday song draft featuring @KenTremendous @nprmonkeysee @BMcCarthy32 @sepinwall and @mikedicenzo. https://t.co/Nnv6dMikGc
RIP Dick Enberg. https://t.co/v0ZnKrsJfL
As if @Lin_Manuel wasn't cool enough, check this out. https://t.co/lEFwd2Jjv7
And our producer @tjfiorillo put together a playlist of the holiday songs selected, should you somehow feel like you aren't hearing enough holiday music. https://t.co/uKKlfWQTno
Our PosCast gift to you -- a Holiday song draft where @KenTremendous rips @BMcCarthy32 and @nprmonkeysee crushes @KenTremendous and we all yell at @sepinwall and @mikedicenzo quietly steals the thing. Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Imagine a PosCast where @BMcCarthy32, @nprmonkeysee, @sepinwall, @mikedicenzo and @KenTremendous all draft holiday songs. Do you have the image? Now double it. And double it again. Dropping tomorrow.
In case you missed it, @KenTremendous, @BMcCarthy32 and I drafted "We are the World Singers" in last PosCast, available wherever podcasts live. This is the stupidest PosCast ever ... until tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow's PosCast ...
Two Browns columns in one day? Brilliant reader Patrick does the math of comparing Browns to 1962 Mets. https://t.co/ypmgHwss6X
Angels are the latest team to try to go crazy in the offseason in an effort to take that final step. Will it work this time? https://t.co/lvRgMAeRkR
The @Browns go to 0-14, and the NFL sucks me into it vortex of evil and blithering insanity for one day. https://t.co/GdhBaUtQqY
A quick return to Twitter to remind you that every wonderful and magical touchdown catch you remember from your childhood, every last one, would be ruled incomplete in today's NFL. OK bye
In the latest PosCast, I probably lose my spot in the BBWAA, @KenTremendous yells at me and @BMcCarthy32 makes it abundantly clear he prefers Kenny Loggins to Bruce Springsteen. I don't know how I survived it; I certainly don't know how you will. https://t.co/wQIYmKv9Rz
Yes, this really happened -- @KenTremendous, @BMcCarthy32 and I really did draft We Are The World performers. Because. On @Stitcher, @audioBoom, @iTunesPodcast and a podcast filling station near you. https://t.co/2SwUYEEvgS
So you're saying to yourself: What would happen if @KenTremendous, @BMcCarthy32 and I got together to draft people in the We Are The World video? Coming tomorrow, folks.
A few thoughts on my friend Bob Costas winning the @baseballhall Ford Frick Award. https://t.co/YXr5gEhMSG

One thing I love about the election of Jack Morris and Alan Trammell induction to @baseballhall: It's a celebration of that wonderful baseball decade, the 1980s! https://t.co/WqxWEYOY0L
The Cleveland @Browns go to 0-13. https://t.co/qlyrGcmjMX
Good to see 1980s baseball get more love in the Hall of Fame. Congrats Jack Morris and Alan Trammell.
@Bencjacobs Focused on players. And I've written about a hundred "It's a sham that Miller is not in the Hall" essays already.

I readily admit it is much, much, much, much, much, much, much more fun  and rewarding to advocate for the Hall of Fame case of @DaleMurphy3, one  of the all-time good guys.  https://t.co/uZffB9RPqx
Since a few people asked, here's a more complete rant about @gehrig38  not getting any traction in the Hall of Fame voting.  https://t.co/2OHX6WXhpa
@jonweisman @hagerstrom_mark Fair point. The reason I think Schilling is different is he finished second in the Cy in three of those years to crazy good seasons by Randy Johnson and Johan Santana and finished fourth to Pedro in the other.
There's a new little box on the @baseballhall ballot this year. I  didn't  notice it at first. But it's a pretty cool gesture by the  BBWAA.  https://t.co/BGjVzbgPH3
I can't even believe I'm saying this but I am: I have a new Hall of  Fame  pet project. And he's probably not who you are expecting.  https://t.co/miyRdA5y1x

@mike_petriello But even more to the point, the BBWAA votes for the Hall at the Hall's leisure. The BBWAA ignores the Hall's directive at its own risk.
@mike_petriello I think there are voters who have been waiting for Hall of Fame guidance. They now have it. I don't think 75 percent is possible now.
Do you want to read even more about Wins Above Replacement? Obviously, you don't. But I wrote a little something anyway. https://t.co/a4zS4CgG3x
Why I think the Joe Morgan letter probably ends Roger Clemens' and Barry Bonds' hopes for the Hall of Fame. https://t.co/rjVNzztkxe
@raskc05 @CaliforniaPaddy @djshort @MikeBatesSBN @sirsean @baseballhall Wait, a Hall of Fame board member and its official spokesman sends out a letter from the official email account and it's unreasonable to say that it is the Hall's official position? What?
Let's not mistake this. The letter was sent from the Hall of Fame email address. This Joe Morgan letter is the Hall of Fame's stance. https://t.co/7wHbwubDuK
@djshort @MikeBatesSBN @sirsean @baseballhall It was sent from the Hall of Fame email. This is official. This is the Hall's stance.
Here is Joe Morgan's letter. https://t.co/360Qfrho9X
This is the first time the Hall -- or Hall of Famers specifically -- has made its voice heard on the subject. The @baseballhall is now on the record.
Whoa. We Hall of Fame voters just got a letter from Joe Morgan, a Hall of Fame board member, making a strong plea that steroid users NOT be included in the Hall. Fascinating.
The Yankees and Astros both scored almost 200 runs than they allowed. But the Astros won 101 games while Yanks won 91. When adding the individual contributions of the players do you want the Astros to be even with Yanks or way ahead?
I'd say there are 20 players on this year's Hall of Fame ballot who have sizable support for their case. TWENTY.
@keithlaw Where's Huff?
@Lisa_Olson1 @YahooForde @ChuckCulpepper1 @wojespn @MikeVacc Yes! Of course you were.
@YahooForde @ChuckCulpepper1 That was there year he won, when we were with @wojespn. It was 2000, when @MikeVacc joined the party that he lost.
@ErikLundegaard @baseball_ref Love it. Let me guess: Clemens, Seaver, Carlton, Gibson, Koufax, Grove for sure. That's six. So, the baffling one? I think I know this because I just pulled this sort of question off on some friends. I'll say Wilbur Wood.
A few too many thoughts on @billjamesonline challenge to us all to connect WAR to actual wins. https://t.co/ohv7BisB6L

@frightwigwam Not that much, in my view. But it was a compelling narrative which is what Mgr. Of Year has become.

@EvanDavisSports Buck: Because he promised his kid that he would go to the game and get him a baseball.

So much goodness in one tweet. Who needs 280 characters? https://t.co/fA4mujGFO9
@SopanDeb Let me tell you the fable of the man and the king and the chessboard and Twitter ...
@FeitCanWrite Was surprised to find that while Billy Butler was a double play machine, he was not unique. Quite a few players with his knack for the DP.
@DartTalk @billjamesonline Bill's a teddy bear. OK, a kind of tough teddy bear with a beard who doesn't put up with nonsense at all. Maybe forget the teddy bear analogy.
@ItsSkylineTime Also: WHY WOULD ANYONE PUBLICLY SAY THEY WANT TO PLAY FOR THE CLEVELAND BROWNS?
@jrizzo112076 Fun, but not nearly enough plate appearances to consider him yet.
Let's talk a bit about that amazing Charlie Blackmon double play stat ... and one that it turns out is even better. https://t.co/5P3h8d3ILY
Please help me me hit my goal because (1) We're fighting cancer and (2) This stupid beard is absolutely killing me. #NoShaveNovember https://t.co/LaAOkQlx8O https://t.co/k4NbEqYrDQ
This is actually insane. Blackmon has grounded in to 20 double plays in his entire career. Thirteen players grounded in more JUST THIS YEAR. I had no idea. https://t.co/BAs4Eq4DwW
@castrovince Eh, go have a drink called loneliness. It's better than drinking alone.
@castrovince I'll tell you one thing I'm not doing and that's wearing a younger man's clothes.
@andrewaohara @KenTremendous Confirmed. Nothing else is even possible.
Hey @KenTremendous our next PosCast should be entirely about this. https://t.co/2pkwCZgv5Q

@robneyer @baseballhall Frank Jobe and Tommy John as a twin-entry!
To go with the Twitter poll, here are a few thoughts about the real Hall of Fame ... and your PERSONAL Hall of Fame. https://t.co/LBY7WYy2ER
I stepped on a rake. It bonked me in the head. This week's PosCast with @KenTremendous. https://t.co/wQIYmKv9Rz
@SteveRushin Similar.
@bruce_arthur Sure NOW you tell us.
I realize poll is limiting and many would choose all three considerations or others. Looking for the choice that closest fits your ideal.
You get a 100-player Personal Baseball Hall of Fame. Would you choose 100 greatest players regardless of other considerations? (Best choice)
@ScottMichaux Nope. But he will get 1,000 words.
Yes, I'm starting the 11-part series already. https://t.co/4mKTqNN15p
@ScottMichaux You know an 11-part series is coming, right?
Hey @KenTremendous, I suggest that our next PosCast be entirely about this Tweet. https://t.co/OGnotqtz7E
@KenTremendous To be fair, though, you could argue that this week we achieve peak meaninglessness.
Hey, in this week’s PosCast ... yeah same thing, @KenTremendous and I talk for way too long about meaningless stuff. https://t.co/zOYNsrh3mv
What if the @Chiefs had followed founder Lamar Hunt’s wishes and called themselves the Kansas City Texans? https://t.co/ZXaCNVR4jZ
@BHancockCFP I do remember @StevePoliti’s column off that game, though.
@DaniWex Oh, it's plenty gross.
Keep the Browns diary going:
I’m doing this #NoShaveNovember thing but I fear the only thing I’m raising awareness about is how stupid I look with a beard.
The existential question is: Can we even fall back from where we are?
@tepertweets Page 336.
@AlanShipnuck The field is now 130 yards, the hedges were raised, and the place has been Clemson-proofed.

@EnswellJones And, I've noticed, you tend to overuse the a and s keys.
Who is pitching tonight and ... oh yeah. Sigh. PosCasting with @KenTremendous today as we face the long winter ahead.
Just landed after a cross country flight without WIFI. How many soul-sucking NFL injuries did I miss?
I actually agree with the part that Dale is a great interview, but I like the “Is the dress gold or blue” ambiguity of first tweet.

A #WorldSeries seen through the eyes of George Springer and Cody Bellinger. https://t.co/zwgWf8IuIz
Charlie Morton in line to get the win because ... it's a dumb rule, that's why. Well, he deserves it as much as anybody.
Puns of this quality are retweeted. https://t.co/QR8aGu4cIM
I say we don't see Joe Sambito until the eighth.
Do the Dodgers get the tying run on base at any point tonight?
Bellinger has struck out six consecutive times. Is there a woman in white in the house who can stand up?
@joe_sheehan I don't disagree with that. But part of the reason I agree is Dodgers bench is so short.
@jonlustig Exactly. My. Point.
@joe_sheehan Come on Joe, you know my point.
@mtwhite06 That was precisely my point.
@joe_sheehan And what is the Dodgers win expectancy right now?
I cannot believe how many people would hit Kershaw on two days rest down five runs. But I know when I'm outnumbered.
@joe_sheehan Fair, but 11 runs this Series scored in that situation. You're down 5. Kershaw's on two days rest. Running out of at-bats.
@jtyardley Because he is pitching on two days rest and they trail by five runs.
Having Kershaw bat down 5 in World Series is sad. The Dodger bench is so short, they simply didn't have a hitter to burn in that situation.
Cody Bellinger looks like Roy Hobbs when he was dating Kim Basinger.
George Springer got all his strikeouts out of way in Game 1. Doesn't seem like he's missed a pitch since.
Today, @KenTremendous and I did emergency PosCast. And I wrote an emergency @Browns diary. Emergencies everywhere!  https://t.co/jCmo4ZjWIM
RIP Caulton Tudor, a legend of North Carolina sports writing and a man who was very kind to me when I was young and so needed kindness.
In time for Game 7, @KenTremendous and I offer an emergency PosCast that is typically meaningless but much shorter. https://t.co/TtWgJOAj8g
@MDoggNic Agreed. So why the problem with Rich Hill giving the fans the time to boo him?
@MDoggNic One of those other two years was in Japan.

Tommy Lasorda to Dave Roberts: “You haven’t done (bleep) until you win tomorrow.”
@MattTheE Tough call. 93 pitches -- he probably only had one more inning in him. And they needed to get that run across.
@joe_sheehan Well maybe not Joc. :)
Because I'm getting a few of these -- the point is the double switch was dumb. He could have pinch-hit Utley without burning a starter. https://t.co/weknE7MuPB
@PC1963 You think Forsythe wouldn't have made that play? And they could have pinch-hit Utley there without burning a starter.
In the grand scheme of things -- even in the tiny scheme of things -- it means nothing. But that Roberts double switch was dumb.
There's our first home run negated by the cooler weather, right?
Getting this from my daughter Katie during the World Series made me so happy. It’s a Halloween… https://t.co/MnDwOlzDpQ
Puns of this quality are retweeted. https://t.co/mutUU9z5f7
Rich Hill walking around and stretching to allow fans more time to boo Yuli Gurriel is pretty strong stuff.
The first time a shaken Doug Mientkiewicz faced Verlander he said, "Tell me that guy was the first pick in the draft." He wasn't. Who was?
Rich Hill through 2 IP: 24 pitches, 20 strikes. That plays.
@nprmonkeysee Kiss: Kiss. Marry: Reese's Cup. Kill: Butterfinger.
They're playing some Oingo Boingo at Dodger Stadium and that makes so very happy.
@ktfuntweets How about making that trade and THEN forgetting to turn it in? It would make for a fun exit interview figuring out why you fired them.
I'm not usually for firing a whole front office, then rehiring them just so you can fire them again. But drastic times ... https://t.co/kk2kGryx92
But getting Garoppolo would have meant giving up DRAFT PICK. Draft picks are the BEST. DRAFT PICKS win Super Bowls. https://t.co/sKwRbm2L6U
Game 6 winner.
I will miss Halloween at home for the first time in more than a decade. The sad part is ... my kids are now old enough they don’t care.
This World Series is already fantastic. With a big finish it will be on of the all-time great ones. https://t.co/MOx8iVm9kp
On this plane ride to LA, I wrote a little something about the Browns. I'm apparently angrier than I thought. https://t.co/rG0Na9LgdE
I don't remember writing this. I don't remember tweeting it out. I don't remember anything. World Series Game 5. https://t.co/jeMJvtN4M0
The way this series is going Nick, my best advice is to wear something comfortable. https://t.co/t89qjwGzCJ
Writing about that crazy Game 5 was like blearily writing about a half-remembered dream. https://t.co/jeMJvtN4M0
@BoogSciambi Chicken is fowl.
Well, let's just say it: Never seen a game like this before. Seen some wild ones. But never a game like this.
Exhaustion.
At some point, there's simply no going to-Morrow.
Repeat: That. Was. A. Bomb.
Sometimes the baseball gods do listen.
You can imagine how much I like the bunt here.
That. Was. A. Bomb.
@mitchellichtman Of course. But eight home runs in five games ain't great.
@mitchellichtman I gave one up in '89 to Candy Maldonado.
Yikes. https://t.co/8TY7BSeOL9
Baseball isn't meant to be predicted, I guess. It's meant to be enjoyed.
Logan Forsythe, World Series MVP?
@DocSandersonSD @ClaytonKersh22 There is a pitcher, somewhere in the Australian bush, with a fastball you wouldn't believe.
Hey @DaleMurphy3 on the Forsythe play -- is the correct play to stay in the rundown to be sure the run scores? Or do you like going for 2nd?
Editors matter. https://t.co/3RktLLRnuQ
Hey @jonahkeri head out and meet Bags. Cool guy. https://t.co/Hz7KOIicmg
Keuchel? Kershaw? Biggest strike zone in baseball? Buckle up. https://t.co/52vDKQryQA

The Cleveland Browns looked at this man and said, "Eh, nah." https://t.co/k6wgNxmXDE
Of all the podcasts I’ve been lucky enough to do, this is certainly one of them. https://t.co/o0OLP8rrvb
Announcer Trent Green says "Browns haven't given up" w/4:58 left in game. Might be latest "Browns haven't given up" this season. Progress!
The Browns are multi-continent stinky.
The Dodgers found their balance .... just in time. https://t.co/CsKkRidELF
Thank you, that's, G-e-o-r-g-e-B-r-e ... https://t.co/fG996VIR0r
Cody Bellinger said he hoped he got out of his "slump" soon. ... He got out of his "slump" soon.
Ken Giles vs. the heart of the Dodgers lineup in the ninth inning of a tie game in the World Series. That will work.
What the heck are the Dodgers doing on the bases? How in the world does Bellinger not tag up on that play?
Dodgers now 1-for-16 with runners in scoring position which is not the most efficient way to score runs.
After an exchange of punts, we now move to action later in the third quarter.
Cody Bellinger is 0-for-11 with 7 Ks in the World Series. He’s not too worried. Dodgers need him to be right. https://t.co/gDgtcUaQc3
OK @KVanValkenburg, it’s time for you to start writing some Dave Barry type books explaining your state. https://t.co/oq45MqxG0G
Puig in motion (adding to @mike_petriello) https://t.co/EDe4JU5g4N
Bases loaded, nobody out, Corey Seager and Justin Turner coming up ... my poll did not age well.
Every World Series game is precious, of course. But how much do you burn the bullpen to try and win this game?
@JeffHeckelman I don’t care what anyone says, black socks are the best socks.
And your other starter for Game 3, Yu Darvish. https://t.co/voAYk2VI12
Your Game 3 starter Lance McCullers Jr. warms up. Let’s play some balls: https://t.co/p1IyftoOzg
A few thoughts on the AL/NL East managers who made the playoffs and were then let go. https://t.co/HIbPljCGDE
A great reminder from @nlbmprez. This is a baseball cap with metal plates sewn in for Jackie Robinson — because so many threw at his head. https://t.co/MmF16r2DsR
@AUG_SMichaux Same thing.
We are closing in on World Series Game 3. https://t.co/ytbWBLda5f
A few thoughts on the postseason bullpen revolution in anticipation of #worldseriesgame3 https://t.co/IZ67pAW0ik
FYI, the PosCast that @KenTremendous and I did that wasn’t recorded properly was awesome and streamlined and filled with insight and wisdom.
@yonnubie @brianmctaggart Working on it.
@KenTremendous @nprmonkeysee “Doctor, will I ever play the piano again.”  Doctor then considers my condition and responds, fully unaware that I am not a piano player.
@emmaspan “This time it counts until we outsoar the shadow of our night where calumny and hate cannot touch us. Tonight on Fox, followed by New Girl.”
@king_kaufman @EdgeofSports You have lost your way, King.
“And those of you not offended ... NFL watch party, my place!” https://t.co/BW1V5hRZb4
@EdgeofSports They are both delightful, Dave.
Please offer congratulations to @tjfiorillo, who arrived as PosCast producer. He finally lost a podcast due to technical audio problems.
Was “Eye of the Tiger” ever, even for a day, your favorite song?
So #worldseriesgame2 was such a blur that I barely remember writing this. But apparently I did. https://t.co/rdt6ggBviP
All three East managers who made the playoffs this year were fired.
World Series Game 2 was like the best concert of your life ... and you just wanted one more encore. https://t.co/uhnrYB4dvO
They played a pretty good ballgame here. @ Dodger Stadium https://t.co/t15hkpIA07
@FlemESPN Look at the Flemstah talking some hardcore baseball. I couldn’t be happier.
I look forward to the publication of new book, “Ledes I wrote and discarded for Game 2 of the World Series.”
And now FREE TACOS. What other madness can happen in this game?
I predict we don’t see a piano playing chicken until, at the earliest, the 13th inning.
Baseball been very very good to all of us.
@CharlesPPierce OK, I’ll “ask around.” Ha ha. Let me go do that.
@CharlesPPierce Come on.
You have to be kidding me.
@joe_sheehan Historically, you have throw in 3. An
I disagree with everything you just said. https://t.co/7royFINb27
They played “Let’s Go Crazy” between innings reminding again that there is literally no situation, not one, that isn’t improved by Prince.
Someday, hundreds of years from now, when they study us ancient and unenlightened people, they will say: “Well, they did have Vin Scully.”
@thisisweber @summerbrennan Have written 40% of my book so far in the library by our house. And I’ve only written 43% of my book.
@DougLesmerises Pretty sure he just did.
On Kershaw and Koufax and destiny. https://t.co/VMxjjWhoqz
@Pfeiffer86 @Dodgers Changed his swing. Killed the ball in September. Worked out like crazy during off-season; tremendous work ethic. I mean, they RELEASED him.
@Pfeiffer86 @Dodgers You’re joking, right? OF COURSE they should have known. That’s their job. If they were looking at his OPS, they’re not doing it right.
The @Dodgers do have a giant payroll, yes. Their runs tonight have come from a guy the Mariners gave up on and a guy the Mets gave up on.
Lots of talk about 1988 in LA the last couple of days. For five innings, this World Series has felt like a pitcher’s duel right out of 1988.
In a weird way, it’s comforting to know that even the impossibly great Clayton Kershaw sometimes throws middle-middle fastballs.
Based on the latest organ song at Dodger Stadium, how much better is 99 Luftballons than 99 Red Balloons?
Well, that happened.
The World Series is about to begin ... https://t.co/MkyJF2GwwF
Thanks all. Now let’s get ready to get ready to have a pregame ceremony for some baseball!
@benbrewster I think they’re up there somewhere but if you are a PosCast listener then you already know ... I have NO IDEA how the podcasting tech works.
@BenShashack I’d love to see Montreal get a team again. After that, I would need to be swayed ... just don’t have a strong feeling.
@sinor_john Thank you! That was a lot of fun.
@claireeliz10 I think pitching coaches, hitting coaches, bench coaches, these people can make a big difference.
@1kartmania I’m for limiting pitches for relief pitchers and umpires being firm about speeding up pitchers and hitters.
@chico1640101 So hot the Dodgers uniforms have turned red.
@JoshRovner Managing players.
@jaaronwalter I’m open to having some fun with realignment. But I don’t think that’s where baseball’s head is right now.
@____tjp 81 seems reasonable. I think they’re getitng better. Pitching is a real question.
@DJWilson55 Over. Ball is flying out tonight.
@Hyland27 Oh yes.
@murrymo Looks like a fantastic hire for the Red Sox. You never know, of course, but he seems totally ready to be a managerial star.
@joemadison89 Time turn to 1997, and tell Mike Hargrove NOT to put Jose Mesa in the game.
@DaniWex Dani, I put baseball somewhere between ice cream and ... chocolate ice cream.
@benbrewster @KenTremendous Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ... disown.
@JeffRichTalks Possible but not probable. I expect the Browns to find two victories in the wildnerness. I don’t know how.
@scottrmoore I think he’s long gone. As far as should they try — I like Hosmer a lot but I suspect someone will wildly overpay.
@Broncfan07 I’m not optimistic. But they were better this year than I thought.
@artwoz They need at least one, maybe two, starting pitchers. I know everyone is writing off Arrieta, but I wonder if they make a run at him.
@Jbeck73 Sigh.
@sleeper_fantasy Game changes so often ... I’d suggest writing a lot, offering your services for small events, blogging perhaps. Best of luck to you.
@doctorshrugs Not a chance.
@_parichardson @KenTremendous LeBron has made EVERYTHING easier on Cleveland fans, for sure. But nothing can dull the pain for Browns fans.
@nervousnatsfan @carlosdelvaca I don’t think it makes them look good at all, but there are only 30 of these jobs. And they are loaded. They will have choices.
@hare_2002 Any slight movement of the body beyond coughing/sneezing is grooving.
@theyearahead NO, and it’s been rough. Coming to my hometown next year, and I should have tickets.
@mminer329 Frank Deford was my idol. Jim Murray was my idol. Now, why, it has to be my brother @MikeVacc.
@aWolgs It was funny when he went to Houston and had that amazing postseason and every said, “Whoa? Who is this guy?”
@genetEJC @Dodgers @DieterRuehle No, but Summer Breeze played, and it was glorious. Then some Depeche Mode.
@SNESdrunk Yes because I think he’s good for another three or four years. If he retired tomorrow, I still think he’d have a shot, but not 1st ballot.
@dlbaral Mexico is the most likely of those ... I can’t get my arms around how baseball really feels about expansion.
@vc_wg They’ll go after Moustakas, I imagine. Not sure how much money they want to spend this offseason, to be honest. Early weeks will be a tell.
@carlosdelvaca I have a friend, huge Nats fan, who quit the team because of how they treated Dusty. He’s a good man and he deserved better than that.
@jtsfasu Well @KenTremendous says they are cursed for the next 21 years because of their stadium shenanigans. They have some good young players.
@davepond88 I think they have a legit shot at bringing back Moustakas and Escobar, but it will really depend on the direction Dayton wants to take club.
@sharkbiotech Can’t pick one. But the potential of having @BMcCarthy32 on a soon-to-be-recorded PosCast has me pretty pumped.
@JamieReidy Would love that. Probably send my assistant Jennifer an email — her email is on my Website. She’s more responsible than me.
@Ethan_Bryan Taking it one game at a time, Ethan, but hoping I might see you at some point when I’m in KC.
OK, I’ve seen other people do this ... I’m just sitting here grooving to the organ, so I’ll take some questions if you have any.
@MJWilliams1975 @Dodgers @DieterRuehle Yes.
As if it couldn’t get any better, @Dodgers organist is now playing Heatwave. Bravo @DieterRuehle.
To update last tweet: Gotta says @Dodgers organist @DieterRuehle is absolutely killing it.
Gotta say — @Dodgers organist is absolutely killing it.
@mitchellichtman Agreed.
Every year we talk about the importance of homefield advantage in the World Series. This year, it might be true. https://t.co/E343o08iZi
