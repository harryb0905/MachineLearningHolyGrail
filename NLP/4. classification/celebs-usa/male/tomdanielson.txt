@PsycCyclingProf @TouroftheGila @abimickey @philgaimon @veloguide @AvVleuten @AdamMyerson I use a process I call the VISION. First identify your Purpose (What you love about cycling and what you get out of your rides.) Then identify your Perspective (your true level). Finally identify the Outcome (the result) you want. When these 3 are aligned, there is zero fear.

@KeepMovinYall Thank you Sarah
Making people look bad you compete with, you are jealous of, or you simply dislike is not a winning strategy for YOU.
@lisarich0105 Thank you.
Leave your past behind and become obsessed with the possibilities that lie in front of you. https://t.co/6yAjqYHSdx
@bez1975 @philgaimon Thank you Craig! You guys are all inspiring me to open up more so thank you very much for that.
@trevorhogg @philgaimon Thank you Trevor!
@_backroads @buffcommacu @philgaimon I think the best lesson from all of this was just be yourself. Just go out and be you. Sounds so simple, but it's the direction to always go
@buffcommacu @_backroads @philgaimon Thank you and I am grateful for the opportunity to share these experiences with others.
@Red_Buzzard Thank you
The starting point to a successful path is being authentic.
@AllenHThompson @philgaimon Thank you. I needed all the horrible stuff to figure out how to become who I really was. Now I have experiences and processes to teach from

@AllenHThompson @philgaimon Thank you Allen!
Oh what's this @CinchCycling !!!!! https://t.co/HScbU6njMc
Look at what you DO have and DO something with it. Stop looking for what's wrong or what's missing and trying to fix/find it. https://t.co/k6QFc0tiWW
Passion is what you need to start the journey to your dreams. When your tears of joy wash away your sweat and blood you have broken through. https://t.co/Sgdqag4oCV
A good business is one that solves people's problems. Too many today you go to for help, but instead are presented with more problems.
@michaelmuhney @philgaimon Will this be live on TV!?! If I just won Lombardia and had to race a guy in a biscotti skin suit I think would be a bit nervous...

@JGrantis @TheGroupRidePod @alex_howes @rusty_woods Thank you but I have been working hard on my business and not enough on my fitness. I am trying to do my best balancing everything!
@TheGroupRidePod @alex_howes @rusty_woods Phil is stronger now than he was racing pro, confirmed!
@michaelmuhney So many more moves for you to learn young Jedi...
@michaelmuhney Yes and make sure you drop the bike into each turn;)
@Johnjanneck @philgaimon @alex_howes @rusty_woods Fun suffering on your wheel today! You are a great climber!
@Laurieisallin Through making a plan that uses training/mental concepts which you build processes there you then bring to your work/family.
Thank you @philgaimon for your friendship, an amazing experience (not really any cookies tho), and a good ass kicking on my bike today. https://t.co/ujkLX3iYBp

@l_r_gonzalez @philsfondo Yeah that was a fun ride with you guys! Can't wait for tomorrow!
@philgaimon The VIP is insane!!!!
@TownsendArch @happened2think You can never blame the market or the customer. You have to understand the customers needs and meet them.
@happened2think But I feel that most do neither of those things. It's these shortcomings they should be concerned with, not cheap cool bikes.
@happened2think If shops give customers a great experience by treating them well and meeting their needs then they should be ok.
@cokesdonegal @philgaimon Thank you Colm!
@michaelmuhney See you there!!!!!
@AaronTarango66 Thank you Aaron!!!!!
@ricknovak Thank you.
@michaelmuhney You riding Phils ride this weekend??!?
Get out of your head and get into your body. Use your body to create emotions that will shift your mindset. https://t.co/dDGTwvVu76
Life is just so much easier after your workout. What a great reminder that was today!
How do you create razor sharp focus? Change your "I should" to "I must." Now your human instincts will assist you with the clarity you need. https://t.co/deRv4Jiq7M
Check out this week's CINCH podcast to hear how my new interval, the Dream Killer, turned my week into a nightmare: https://t.co/BkD6HT03jZ https://t.co/OrqxOxew0M
Finding clarity is the key to unlocking your highest performing state. Know exactly what your are chasing before you start moving. https://t.co/2GcyKYusQz
Here we go!!!!! https://t.co/PdtprLHzln
@JohnLyons50 Hahahaha!
Here's how to make those attacks stick on your group rides and races: https://t.co/QA6HoWzt88 https://t.co/5C4l4GIcFR
Confidence comes from true certainty in your strategy. Knowledge from your and/or other's mistakes and successes is where you find certainty https://t.co/FGYp5evh6z
Lacking confidence? Confidence comes from certainty behind your process. Know your strategy and know why it's going to work. Period. https://t.co/y8YooyyIWE
Great ride today! Worked hard this am and put myself in an elevated mental, emotional, and physical state all day. Felt like super Dad! https://t.co/xwNaD5Dz1Y

@rayjebsen @CinchCycling Thank you Ray!
If you want to win at sport, business, or life, you need to first focus on what emotion you are chasing. Build your process around that. https://t.co/DvYtwyNxH2
@hrtmtnfarmboy F&amp;$k yeah!
@amigostweet So plan your day for tomorrow!
I don't wanna sound cheesy, but seriously. Guys, from everything I've learned, live for the journey, not the destination. Go get it... now
Don't work in the industry because you want to ride. Work there because you want to help others ride. https://t.co/qAENkgLQBK
Fulfillment starts with your mental state. Use physical activity to put you in your best emotional place. https://t.co/8RWssiEhuq
Keep your head up looking to the future with the present still in sight. You need to be able to see both to move forward.
Strategy is important, but the timing of it is everything. This applies to cycling, business, and family.
@hogpen_gap Yeah those climbs and roads are second to none.
When I changed the narrative of my story I changed my life. Success followed as wrote the script from my heart. #theprocess
Coaching to me is not just about making people's hearts stronger, but showing them new experiences to feel with them. #culture https://t.co/QsJTSqxVkP
Positivity is more than a way of thinking, it's a force.
@JulieBDuggins Thank you Julie!!!
Plan to start your day with action not expectation. https://t.co/HhgVEGKubK
Write down the words that describe how you felt on your best day. These sensations and emotions are what you should be CREATING daily.
Brasstown Bald brought me both heavenly and hellish feelings. Accept that in your life you can't find fulfillment without the two. https://t.co/TNOxxDoqN1
@grilloLDI Thank you.
Life is not fair. Stop trying to understand why things happened to you and replace those thoughts immediately with plans to move forward.
Success is only truly success when it comes with happiness. Create happiness from where you can grow, improve, and measure your achievement. https://t.co/wx8ptRJpdp

To change and improve you first have to break your patterns. Surround yourself with others who can guide and support you to do this. https://t.co/z5fstLDQEE
The moment you want to let go is also the moment right before you break through. https://t.co/xhK8HlQ2ez
I do not see age, gender, or experience as a barrier. Each person has a road to personal greatness and it starts with helping them find it. https://t.co/41tDqcbHty
@PhilJones937 @RollfastFondo Of course! I was trying to help as many of our group as possible make it.
@TheAdamSweeney Yes

To feel your true self improvement you first need to learn how and where to find it. https://t.co/x4u8RatU9j
The people that show you hate are the people who need your help. Listen and understand before you give hate back.

I believe cycling should fulfill 2 important human needs for you: progress and achievement. https://t.co/us7BnpWwex?amp=1
Here are my thoughts on why you should train with structure. https://t.co/us7Bnqe7D7
@Fizzhogg Most people follow someone else's why or try to make a why around someone else's how.
The WHY you want to do it should always come before the HOW you plan to do it. https://t.co/6MyeAEz4b8
@jeffkmd @philgaimon It's possible
The moment to decide if you can or cannot do something is not the most difficult one. Chances are if you've gotten that far YOU CAN do it. https://t.co/9BATflJxf4
@Jeff_in_Denver @CinchCycling That was so awesome!!!!
Pace too hard? A little phrase I like to use is "there's nothing good back there!" Giving up hurts the same physically, but worse mentally. https://t.co/zVTzIJyldU

You define what success is! Stop looking to others to determine what you should be chasing. Look inside, define, and go get it. https://t.co/NGkaQ4nvfF

Feelings of progress and achievement are human needs. Create them from your cycling and give happiness and inspiration to those around you. https://t.co/fWsnlnKFmM
The ones who stand the tallest are the ones who have fallen down the hardest.

If you are not moving forward, you are moving backwards.  You don't need to go in a perfect line, just go!
There's a big difference between a plan and a plan that you are accountable for.
Raise a standard. Pick a "should" and change it to a "must." You are not going to settle for less than what you view to be your standard. https://t.co/wGaRcAfbiW
@Jslavinphx Thank you Jamie
Worrying about what other people think, good or bad, does nothing for you. Focus on moving yourself forward or get left behind. https://t.co/hekoaDDyxf
When you face adversity don't lower your intensity level, RAISE IT. #gotime https://t.co/bBk9ga2Wqk
Don't tell people to believe in themselves. Instead show them what about themselves to believe in. https://t.co/3wuK7Xgl9b

@MichaelREdgar Crush it!
@FFXFireAFC I just am working on people's coaching and basically write these things back.  Fun to share with everyone.
A lack of motivation is lack of direction. You create motivation by having a plan, not by planning to find it. https://t.co/vFqAtU2eVw
Real power is to be able to empower.
@cyberdyne Exactly!
Your successes and failures do not define you; your actions everyday do. Own your mistakes, own accomplishments, and OWN your daily process. https://t.co/R4I29O2f17
I love to create new intervals. Today I tested a new one that was built around one of my all-time weaknesses: https://t.co/vxrqKGj4ii
The best opportunities come from mistakes. Embrace your mistakes by immediately learning and building from them. #theprocess

@Nimmell You are focused on the discomfort you are feeling, not on the task you are doing or the mission you began the task with.

Cycling is a sport that gives you the tools to change your life. Ride how you want to live. https://t.co/gYiTkJ2GId
@DrOakley1689 @CinchCycling Or you could learn from him! There was a whole group with me there!
Quintana has PERSPECTIVE: "You‚Äôve got to take the blows and accept defeat with the same humility as you do when you‚Äôre a winner."
@KwmKen No. Just very fit and relaxed. He enjoys the race and the challenges.
@luke0411 I think he switched bikes
@belpower No. Human motor
I've had times I've ridden a broken wheel or a wheel that doesn't shift to the finish because I'm scared to stop.
Second thing is both times he either reset his computer and or took a drink when chasing. He chose to switch wheels, not out of desperation.
Interesting that no one is picking up that Chris is good enough to change wheels when the race is ON. It takes confidence to do that.
@rick_gilliam They did go all in and that is why no one could attack when he joined. Not smart.
Here are some of my thoughts on how to better deal with disappointment: https://t.co/SiiUZbiC4N
@DanceswtCars @nealrogers @patriciaamberg I'm ok with an attack. Pulling as hard as you can for 2 hours is another story...
@thecyclingsnob @nealrogers @patriciaamberg EXACTLY!!!!! And now have NO more bullets in the last week! Code red.
@nealrogers @iain_forfar @patriciaamberg Use the energy where you get the best return on investment. They had nothing left in the end to cover or even attack. That's a clear sign.
@nealrogers @iain_forfar @patriciaamberg Again you are missing it. Energy use is absolutely key right now. Go back and look how Aru rode in the beginning of the race and look now.
@nealrogers @patriciaamberg So if he didn't have a problem do you think their use of energy was a good plan?
@nealrogers @patriciaamberg Oh I'm just trying to share some insight. They had that plan before he had his problem. The stress he had was from his problem, not them.
@nealrogers Yes, every "effort" counts. A lot of bullets used and all of them missed the target. Very poor return on energy investment.
For those of you wondering what the end of today's stage felt like, imagine your Tuesday night group ride AFTER riding 100 miles. #TDF17
Dan Also no Grand Tour wins so let him go...
Maybe this effort was for the virtual resume. Not concerned with Yates as he has not yet won any grand tours...
Incredible team attack on 8th place... maybe one of the best in Tour history.
Question: Why are you on @Strava ? 1. To compare yourself to others 2. To socially connect with others. The answer may be holding you back.
@WallStSteward Ok. Shoot! It's just you did a really good workout!
Some of my thoughts on preparing mentally for your weekend race or event. Don't evaluate, execute!  https://t.co/CgpNVTCvJ7
How would you define your relationship with your bike? Make sure that relationship enables you to express who you are each ride #theprocess https://t.co/8PccDbX26w
@meta9 Not worth wasting energy arguing that others did it and didn't get penalized. Focus on yourself and if you made a mistake move on.
@meta9 Don't take feeds in the last 20 whatever k. Not really a discussion. It's sucks and maybe is a dumb rule, but we all know it.
I think this tour will be exciting because Froome is calculated and his two threats are not. They ride on emotion.
Also pay attention to the interview. "I just didn't have it." Perspective people, perspective. He did the best he could with the situation.
In my opinion Froome was low on glycogen in the end today, not fitness. A low fitness Froome rides the climbs a bit different.
My 2 cents: We all know Froome is not as fit as years past. So this is EXCITING, not "what's wrong."
Ever wonder what you can learn from watching the #tourdefrance2017 to help your cycling? Here's my Stage 9 analysis: https://t.co/oiNHUC9NZ1

Start this Friday by looking where you want to go instead of looking where you "wished" you went. #FridayFeeling https://t.co/RTunquZkx6
@MichaelREdgar Is that time making you stronger in areas you need? No. If you rested then you would have more for the areas that count.
@MichaelREdgar Yes that is very detrimental. You want the best return on investment of your energy spent training.
@MichaelREdgar The best strategy of all is make the workouts around the recovery available, not try and find the recovery after the workouts.
@MichaelREdgar Yes I can do that
Love the work, not the glory. The work and the commitment is what shapes you forever. The results are gone right after you achieve them. https://t.co/rVcjhFQez0

@InventLawyer19 Right now! Maybe someday when we are bigger!
@InventLawyer19 It's Rec league cycling where anyone can come and learn to compete like how pro cyclists do.
@InventLawyer19 It's for my new road cycling concept. Racing as teams with specific roles. Basically like chess on wheels. The Ref enforces the rules.
@WinoJimbow Thank you!

@OriolBrull thank you!
@philgaimon sorry. I meant to say watch out for the tacks mofo!!!!!
And on Mt Lemmon was where I coached my first rider, @philgaimon . Go crush it dude.
It was this climb where I found my love for showing people a side of themselves they never had seen before. Mt Lemmon was where CINCH began
Mt Lemmon is where I found a side of myself that I was better at than being a bike racer.
I'm excited to see @philgaimon take on Mt Lemmon. It's a special place to me as it represents many things in my life.
@philgaimon @mikemarchlik @HomestretchFdn @oakley @newbalance @cannondalePro @Mavic I did it in 1:10 before.
@philgaimon @Ciclismoyrend @HomestretchFdn @oakley @newbalance @cannondalePro @Mavic I did not have any help actually.

@KourtneyCompton @CinchCycling thanks babe. We are doing it together.
@The_SarahBrown awesome.
@The_SarahBrown yes and it's the whole concept is teaching people how to be safe out on the road.
@The_SarahBrown not at first but at the end.
@The_SarahBrown yes this is a safe and easy as it gets
@The_SarahBrown ok bummer! It's really slow and basic so you could do it with one arm if you had too!
@The_SarahBrown no but the focus will be on people who want to learn how to become better.
@The_SarahBrown big time! That's what it's for!
@WSDB666 @KourtneyCompton and a glass of wine.

@CyclingBoulder it's going to be added into my business to improve the quality of communication we have with our clients.
@CyclingBoulder no I made something pretty cool!
Even cooler I know where and when the plateaus will come and how to plan to build around them!
With that I can accurately define what the athletes should expect in fitness gains.
I just developed a testing protocol which can figure out how close someone's realtime fitness is to their current potential. And it works!

@jknight54 thanks JK! Thank you for your friendship
@winanci not sure how I sound like politicians but those feelings you feel on the bike is what it's about. Not results, power, times, etc
@gbberry @KourtneyCompton you know me well. Hopefully now others can too.
@Brian_Borjas thank you.
@addieolson the biggest thing is that footstep in the am from the bed. It has to have purpose and love of the process.
@addieolson for me I thought by me working hard it inspired people. I took it another level and now I am alongside people working hard.
@addieolson just ask you what about before made you happy. That's your answer.
Riding before was all about me, but now it's about you. I love you all and I hope to share this side of me with you someday personally.
That moment I finally had peace and I no longer resent this day, but welcome it for forcing me to find this side of myself.
I realized my life had just begun. That I could inspire and help people in a much better way then blazing up climbs.
...cycling. I realized people didn't care about how fast I rode. They cared about feeling the feelings they felt on their bike.
But one day on Mt Lemmon in January I found my peace. I stopped to see the difference I was making in people's life's by helping them with..
I was innocent and life was unfair to me. I hated the world for months.
I was so confused why it happened to me and wanted those responsible to pay and suffer like I was inside.
For months I felt sorry for myself. I woke up everyday angry, riding as hard as I could wanting it all to go away.
Today is the anniversary something special. Like all of you, I had something happen to me that I changed my life for ever.

@JonnyOmoto yes, I think maybe then you are using Twitter incorrectly.

@SpeedyJansen yeah you don't need very much. Just be specific and focused. You can keep improving with very short rides, but consistent.
One way I help my clients ride stronger is by creating zones below their lactate threshold. Here's how: https://t.co/tfwvPbhBIM

@KwmKen thanks Ken. It's opened new doors and taught me I'm more than just a racer. I love who I am now and wouldn't change anything.
@acesheldrake I only know from what I've seen personally and from that it's much better.
@TBlack_Design thank you.
You can't control what other people do so why worry about them? Focus on you. https://t.co/yXbi090d17
@acesheldrake has nothing to do with that. People take supplements like they eat food.
@acesheldrake just look at every athletic event. Look at the sponsors. Most sports teams. All with supplement sponsors.
@acesheldrake everything from your immune system to recovery shakes. You are taught that taking care of yourself requires supplementation
@acesheldrake I agree. It's tough as we've all been brought up around them. From day 1 they are around.

@MJIrish86 @ddncons @philgaimon absolutely not. Don't take any. Not worth it at all
@MJIrish86 @philgaimon thank you
@Spookyload thank you Matt
@ONeillLE thank you Sean
@ddncons @philgaimon you are right. Not worth it 100 %.
@MDelhez thanks! Anytime.
@BertStenson @philgaimon good one. It's not about what type I am or not. This is what happened.
@RevBigRing I just did. Then you told me to go away.
@KeggaG good luck man. Looking forward to seeing you out there soon.
@wyattcartwright @petecuster @philgaimon thank you.
@ciclismo87 thank you.
@RevBigRing I don't expect you to believe it. The world works itself out.
@RevBigRing I'm not asking you to apologize just maybe to act like a human. I'm not making any excuses just sharing the truth.
@vbdub @MorganArre thanks. I'm at peace now and am looking forward to showing everyone the dangers of supplements.
@mdlonde @philgaimon you should have a close look into the industry. Unreal. Even if you are not tested, why risk poisoning your body
@lkkinetic it 100 percent would.
@RevBigRing do you like to be told 'don't try to do anything because I don't like to hear about it?'
@VC95 @philgaimon I hope you respect my decision to keep it private at this time. I'm not trying to convince you or anyone of anything.
@mdlonde @philgaimon yes I'm concerned this is happening to many.
@RevBigRing that's a pretty mean thing to say. I'm just trying to do my best.
@mikeroecklein @philgaimon probably say don't take supplements. In Europe this would be easy, in the US would take time to adjust.
@MDelhez yes this would be best. But a bunch of them because there are often big crashes. The problem is who funds this? Not cheap
@MorganArre thank you.
@debroy62 @philgaimon thanks Deb
@thomasdekker @philgaimon thanks TD84
@luke0411 thanks Luke. Not really fighting, just discovering.
@flammecast @philgaimon thank you. I don't expect either one.
@flammecast @philgaimon it's part of our culture. But you are right. We don't need them so don't take them. And yes, it is my fault.
@flammecast @philgaimon you are right. It just sucks. I've grown up taking supplement since I was a kid. Just look at the grocery store.
@MDelhez most have 1 at the races and you need them when you crash.  Look at situations like Stetina and Phinney. Their career was saved.
@flammecast @philgaimon please do. Name 1 innocent person who failed a drug test and did not receive a penalty?
@petecuster @philgaimon yeah, the best part about the truth it doesn't matter who is convinced or not. It does it job sooner or later.
@flammecast @philgaimon maybe not any go free. Can you think of one?
@petecuster @philgaimon Pete I would prefer not to say right now and please respect that.
@MDelhez not needed. Not at all. No way. You are right and spot on. We all believe we need them but we don't.

@Jeff_in_Denver @CinchCycling because you are not training that intensity in your training. A long climb forces you to do it.

There's more zones than you might think when training for cycling. Find yours and use them to improve your riding. https://t.co/tfwvPbzd7m

Performing at your best level is easier said than done. Here is a simple equation to help you: https://t.co/HGBfVvfuq1
@ONeillLE I think just changing the cadence and power is best
Dave inspired me to be a Dad and not a fad. And I will always remember him as just another reason to be the proud and loving Dad I am.
I had to fight with everything I had for my children. But I didn't care. I could handle whatever ridiculous thing that was thrown at me.
It touched me because I personally had to fight for my children. My image was thrown all around all over the Internet as a shit Dad.
But for me the way Dave Mirra touched me the most was his movement to push men into being better fathers.
I loved seeing Dave's blacked out @cervelo P5 wishing someday I would get to ride one.
My friend @cervelo @lesleyloughlin said he was one of the warmest people she had dealt with.
He treated my friends and family in Tucson with the highest level of respect and they all raved about how genuine he was.
Sad to hear about the passing of Dave Mirra. I don't know him well, but I did speak with him a few times and he met my Tucson family. Cont.
@ONeillLE yeah. Consistency is most important. So come up with short and sweet targeted trainer workouts.

Use your money, cameras, and acting ability to bring these people in and stop this shit.
I see from that story a whole business world of Dr's and pharmacists who market, recruit, and make money in the doping world.
In this show I see all kinds of problems that could be properly addressed to help stop doping. Yet nothing is done or mentioned.
I'm sick of all this shit. Doping is a problem because it ruins athletes, organizations, fans, sponsors, and lives.
Right now there's a storyline that currently is being used for entertainment and not solving anything.
There's the police, the FDA, WADA, the NFL, etc. Talk to these people first and get this problem solved.
If your business is reporting then report. Report these people to the correct authorities. There's all kinds of laws potentially broken.
This new reality TV, that's maybe not reality, is the future. The Blair Witch project was so ahead of its time.

I love cycling. I love it so fucking much. I love the races, the rides, the people, the businesses, I love it all. Nothing compares for me.
I feel incredibly hurt, frustrated, and angry by this. I don't understand how or why this happened and still can't even accept this is true
I will now, as I wait for the B test, have the supplements I take, tested to see if this is what caused it.
I would never ever take anything like this especially after everything I have gone through the last years. This makes absolutely no sense
All the possible ways that could have produced this result.
I spoke with them and my team and I will have to sit out the Tour of Utah as I wait for the B sample as well as look into
I have not taken this or any other banned substance
For USADA notifying me that a out of competition test I gave July 9th has tested positive for, from what I understand, synthetic testosteron
Tonight has been one of the worst nights of my life. While I was eating dinner with my team the night before Tour of Utah I received a call
Really special to see @peterstetina and @taylorphinney here at the Tour of Utah. Their respective battles are incredible. Inspired.

@RickyCarmichael yeah it's awesome!
Incredible Tour! I don't think there could have been a higher level field this year and mad respect for @chrisfroome and his team today.
@RickyCarmichael close!
@DonCronos they did from what I saw
@brandy_eve he was going to attack anyway and Froome would not have chased him as well.
@DonCronos yes and every jumped on me saying it was gonna be a boring tour. Now the top 5 is all guys who won grand tours.
@RickyCarmichael then Quintana will be able to follow and then hit him at end. It's gonna be a blood bath tomorrow.
@RickyCarmichael tomorrow is gonna be good as Nibali will again go and that will force Valverde to be aggressive putting pressure on Froome
@RickyCarmichael the others can't risk blowing up going with him.
@RickyCarmichael Nibali is one of the strongest in the race now. No one let him go. He is in a good position where he has nothing to lose
@RickyCarmichael no. He was going to attack anyway. You are responsible to make sure you shift correctly.

@sarah_lukas @KourtneyCompton fun riding with you guys today!!!
Congrats to @RyanDungey on winning the Best Male Action Sport Athlete ESPY award!!!! That's awesome!!!!
For those of you who use @VegaTeam here's a way to save for your next order! Awesome stuff. http://t.co/iJ46NrPFNs
Inspired by @chrisfroome today at the bike park! Elbows on fleek! https://t.co/yET3i2nZw1
Love @UpstartKombucha . Local Boulder company making some great stuff!
I remember in '13 Stage 9 just my team was trying to create a break away. Anyone remember that? Imagine that x 10 every day with a climb now
Let's see. How many Tour winners, grand tour winners, and grand tour podium finishers are behind now? Would you like to chase them all down?
I think this sets up one of the most exciting Tours we've seen in a awhile.
People always think that after a day like today in the Tour the race is over. But, look at all the names that are considerably behind now.
#ForzaIvan
Yeah @MorenoMoser !!!! Congrats on your victory today in Austria!!!!
We saw the Minions talking to @PaulSherwen and @PhilLiggett so here we are at the movie!  Get some!

@tjswonderboy @WaltDisneyWorld yes sir
@garryboy11 @WaltDisneyWorld they were actually very good and all drivers were very courteous.
@kkratt @WaltDisneyWorld yep. Lots of good riding here. All parents should definitely bring their bikes and ride northwest of the park.

@OakleyRich2 no way man. Today is the Animal Kingdom stage. Technical, hilly, and hot. 4 more hours to go and team is still going strong.
Love how at Disney World they use the Panaracer Smoke and Dart tire combo when imprinting bike tires in some walkways.
@ShaunMoore nice! Thank you but I go early! Lots of rides to go on after the bike ride!
@ShaunMoore Disney World with the family! Thanks for the invite but we have a lot of characters to see. Next time I will take you up on that

Knee made it through a tough nine days so I think I'm now in the clear. Now to start the hard work to get ready for Utah and Colorado.

@pod_massage @AirportGenie @mattrabin amazing photo
@mattrabin @pod_massage Both of you DNS today? Did you "slip in some stairs" this am too?!?!
Tons of hard efforts in today's final and the knee did really well! Looking forward to what's coming up...
@MountainVelo @Utahclimber it's over already? Last update I got he was 45 miles ahead! That's baller!!!
@PTAZGuy @PowMow is harder. Best climb I have ever ridden.
@_grammar_ yes my bad. It won't happen again officer.
@pod_massage @mattrabin oh well, it's ok. Luckily you've been checked out by the medical staff and your are ok to start!!
@mattrabin @pod_massage what happened?!?!
@BGRunningham @TourofUtah yes I am.
Oh man I suffered out there today. Coming back from injury is very humbling. These guys go fast!!!! @JoeDombro did a very nice ride today!!!

@KourtneyCompton I can't wait!!!
Tour of Suisse day 3. Knee still feels good, race fitness still not there yet. What a humbling sport! I guess this is why it is so addictive
Knee held up well today. It's been a tough last weeks but happy to see each day I am improving. Just keep pushing!
@KourtneyCompton hahahaha.
Just a redonkulous performance by @PatrickDempsey finishing 2nd in the GTE-AM devision of 24 hours of Lemans!!!!!!! Unreal!!!!!!!!!
Oh that was a shocker! Happy to say my knee feels good and ready to get the engine working again here in Suisse.

@natebrown0707 thanks Nate!!!!! You made me smile. Thank you so much!!!
Really sad to leave the Giro today with my messed up knee from the Stage 2 crash. #heartbroken
Really incredible ride of Ryder today. Looking forward to this week!!!!!
@brentbookwalter @cpacycling @ANAPRC_ needs to be something like 10k. Sprinters can do their thing without us in the way. Everyone's happy.
@jackmott42 you have plenty of danger in the Cat 3's.
@jackmott42 actually no. Have you not seen all the crashes off the front and cars hitting people off the back?
There is NO "safe-zone" in the peloton. This year almost all of the crashes have been at the front. It's scary out there to say the least.
I asked @PhilippeGilbert if he was going to do a cat walk up the last climb today during today's stage. He said yes. #badass
Started complaining about the rain today 2 @KourtneyCompton . She then politely shared her 2.5 hr solo ride in the pooring rain over 2 mtns!
Super cool to see legend @NickyHayden at the start today!
One of the best parts of being at the races with @Ride_Argyle is, well, the food. Meet @Larryvich and Olga, our chefs http://t.co/3YzaXzIKfL
@mtjallingii and to further define that diversity we have the absolute hardest stage that could have been created after the next rest day.
@davideformolo @Ride_Argyle we are a good team;) you ready for some fun?!?!
@Pflax1 hmmmmm.
@Pflax1 what "tactical" mistake are people talking about?!
Ooooohhhhhh @ALANMARANGONI !!!!!!! Sooooooooo close!!!!

Now driving in bus watching British Cops. A little different. Currently a guy is getting busted for having a chainsaw in a public place.
Really awesome with TJ and Ryder lighting it up today. @Ride_Argyle has been on it this Giro!
Here's my @garmin file from Giro stage 8 breakaway http://t.co/UPa6NntNCY
Well shoot. Met the first objective of the day which was to get IN the move. Did a little too much to achieve that and fell short in end.

Maybe Alice and Tim are on a date and that's why its "impossible" for them to help me communicate with the world.
Is it possible to connect a wifi router to a dial up modem?!?! Yep, I'm in Italia baby!!!!! Where is this Alice and Tim?
@Pflax1 yes, you are right it's hard to be able to move forward with a number like that. Let alone a whole hour!
@Pflax1 that's -6.2 watts per kilo. Not possible.

@allyfairly @Nancy_Arreola you guys were coming in hot to Sant Gregori!!!!
@Josehermida I feel like I when I was training with you, you started off with a 1x 1.5 hr at 420.
@calebfairly @KourtneyCompton they are closed even though their hours say they are open. But I Spained the situation with my own Pizza!!!
@Kiss_my_Panache is that apple sauce?
@BobbyStuckeyMS @craiglewis85 well then stay tucked in on the feets all day and wait for your moment. Not one toe in the wind!
@alex_howes two out of three ain't too bad. However, last I checked you do need "some legs" to attack in the last 40km of Amstel.
Impressive win @EricDMarcotte ! Rode so smart, took the chances you needed, and used the horsepower at the right time!!!!
@Larryvich oh boy!!!!! Can't wait to try!!! We are making Sean bars over here in Sant Gregori!!!

@RohanDennis yes I bet that Rainbow Bright guy showed you that one...
@RohanDennis yes miracles can happen. That was a good move to go to the front on the last climb and slow the pace down.

@Vaughters @ammattipyoraily totally. Can barely get up the climbs...
@davideformolo id say your performance today was the best ever I've seen from a Pays Basque rookie (not from Columbia) ever!
Not only is @davideformolo a handsome young man and great bike rider, he is friends with all the teams that don't like us! Today was magic!!
@ammattipyoraily 61.5

@Pflax1 @Fizzhogg @philgaimon mmmm I don't think so either. Bikes skid no matter what breaks u use. They don't just stop.

@ekharvey by the sound of it you really don't need to make yourself better because you have never made any mistakes and are a perfect human.
@ekharvey anyway, this is my point. In the time you went out of your way to make me feel bad you just lost to make yourself better.
@ekharvey you are right. You did make me feel bad with your comments. I don't think people should be treated like that.
@ekharvey on the other hand I like bikes,  motorcycles, trying hard, and being the best person you can. That's me.
@ekharvey I don't like doping, cheating, etc. I  hate it!!!!!! I think these things are horrible
@ekharvey no actually you have shown your stripes. You made your rude, harassing, bullshit comment to my tweet about being mean to people.
@ekharvey and even better, after all that person has done and tried to do, I don't hate or resent them.
@ekharvey thanks for the hate man. You are right, I got thrown away and found someone great.
The time you just spent on hating someone you just lost to making your self better.
