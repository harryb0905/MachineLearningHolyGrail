Anyway ‚Äî ‚Äúwe all have to do better‚Äù means absolutely nothing when you‚Äôve created a super-league that only allows well-funded mega-clubs who all play the exact same style. Put some thought into this, Christian. You could actually make a difference.
My daughter‚Äôs team won the Gold Coast League (and went undefeated), is top-20 in SoCal, doesn‚Äôt play kickball and even has an innovative social media presence. We can‚Äôt get into ECNL unless we get swallowed up by a mega-club. That‚Äôs a good system?  https://t.co/IGxOdKyYkV
To me ‚ÄúWe all have to do better‚Äù means ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think about changing a system that obviously doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù Building ECNL  around mega-clubs + a kickball style that‚Äôs built to win tournament games but doesn‚Äôt actually teach kids how to play soccer ‚Äî that‚Äôs not changing the system.
This all sounds great but why do they only allow big corporate mega-clubs in ECNL and not any successful independent clubs with coaches who think outside the box? Why can‚Äôt indie clubs earn their way in for a year? Why don‚Äôt they have relegation?  https://t.co/PJ2jnSjtTm

New BS Podcast w/ @chrisbosh ‚Äî we discussed the AD/Pelicans saga, the decade of NBA player empowerment, best 21st century power forwards, Lebron‚Äôs arc as a brand ... and he talked me off the ledge about the NBA turning into AAU.  https://t.co/Kz2lJNlvjd
Unfortunately, there are only 3-4 true contenders every year. If you‚Äôre an NBA star, there‚Äôs an 80-85 percent chance you‚Äôre not going to be completely satisfied with your competitive situation. And by the way the next situation probably won‚Äôt be great either. See: Kyrie, 2019.
I don‚Äôt know how the NBA can fix this specific issue, but it completely undermines the concept of a team: Stars grabbing max deals while thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grab the money now, and if we don‚Äôt get better, I‚Äôll just push for a trade.‚Äù AKA... Pulling a Carmelo.
Fans and media have become numb to NBA players doing whatever the F they want. Davis could have waited until this summer to do this ‚Äî instead he imploded the situation for leverage, it didn‚Äôt work, and now he‚Äôs pretending to be the victim. ‚ÄúI want to play.‚Äù This is so lame.
AD now ‚Äúwants to play‚Äù ‚Äî after snaking his franchise on a Monday to launch a news cycle, undermining his own trade value, having his agents repeatedly leak stuff to the media, and trying to force a trade to a specific team with a year and a half left on his deal.
This situation is ludicrous. It‚Äôs been a fun NBA season on the court and an absolute train wreck off the court. If you sign a massive deal to be someone‚Äôs max player ‚Äî here‚Äôs an idea, show up every night and be their best player. What are you doing AD???? https://t.co/sSD0ofl4Wf

I like Harris and got to watch him here ‚Äî great teammate, plays hard, hits open shots. He‚Äôs also been traded four times and he‚Äôs in a contract year. This trade was weird.
That Sixers trade felt desperate - gave up way too much for an expiring FA. And throwing Shamet in the deal was just weird. But fundamentally...  their crunch-time 5 is flawed now. No lineup flexibility, nobody to defend the Kyrie types. Why not make same offer for Jrue Holiday?
How the hell did the Clippers get two firsts, including that great 2021 Miami pick, for a non All-Star who was leaving in 3 months? The Jerry West/Clippers era is amazing.

FYI: the odds of Porzingis signing a huge extension w/ Dallas this summer are 99.99%  Qualifying offer for 2019-20: 5.7m, one year   Dallas extension: 28m in 2019-20, 125-130m range for 4 years.  So he‚Äôd just leave 22+ mill on the table for 2020 w/ his injury history? No way.

Tremendous Rams drive. I love how they used the clock ‚Äî especially obeying the Lombardi Law and not spiking it after they got the long play to Cooks for goal to go with 40 secs left. So many dumbass teams spike it there.
The Rams need to hypnotize Gurley and make him think he‚Äôs playing the 2-10 Cardinals in late November.
Incredible fake punt by the Rams. Really enjoyed it. They needed to do something ‚Äî this game had 40-0 potential.

Perkins makes honorable mention but I can‚Äôt remember him truly snapping during a Celts game.
Since I‚Äôve been a Celts fan we‚Äôve had 3 guys who weren‚Äôt ‚Äúhold me back‚Äù guys during bad blood moments and genuinely wanted to fight if they were pissed: Cowens, Bird and Smart.   ***Not sure about Marcus Morris cuz I‚Äôve never seen anyone provoke him. Probably not a good idea.

I thought the Fyre Festival doc on Netflix was excellent. Here‚Äôs what @harvilla wrote about that one and the Hulu one  https://t.co/AiPZngz23Z
I still think Tatum has a chance to be great. He has every shot and trick you‚Äôd want from a 6‚Äô8 forward - but how he‚Äôs using those shots/tricks (and how he‚Äôs being used) continues to be perplexing. This is the most important thing for Stevens to fix these last 3 months.
My take: Tatum‚Äôs game always falls into place when he‚Äôs attacking the rim and drawing fouls. Also think they could post him up more esp. against smaller players. He‚Äôs only taken 8+ FTA in 5 of 40 games this season which just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
Jayson Tatum was 0-6 last night vs. Memphis. Here‚Äôs his per-36 numbers last year/this year. Strangest subplot of a strange Celtics season ‚Äî good young players almost always make a leap in Year 2. Cannot figure this out. https://t.co/aGgW8pNxo5

Also ‚Äî it‚Äôs OK not to talk after a game, or say anything interesting. It really is. It‚Äôs a long season. You can go 6 weeks being a press conference robot and giving generic quotes. It‚Äôs fine.
The best 2000s superstar leaders were Duncan, Dirk and Nash. All of them avoided discussing locker room issues publicly. I think Curry handles stuff well too. None of them would have beaten this ‚ÄúThese young guys are ridiculous, they don‚Äôt know how to win‚Äù card into the ground.
Agree with @tomecurran ‚Äî Kyrie‚Äôs latest story about calling LeBron was a fancy way of saying publicly that he‚Äôs playing with some young, immature dickheads who reminded him of his former self. Whether it was intentional or inadvertent ‚Äî I dunno. But he should really stop talking.

@wojespn Sac could also keep Shump and throw Koufos‚Äôs expiring into that Knicks deal. They have a bunch of expirings. They don‚Äôt have their 1st either so they should be trying to turn expirings into 1-2 more playoff guys if they make it. I like Kanter as an off the bench playoff banger.
@wojespn Should clarify ‚Äî That Dallas pick heading to Atlanta is top-5 protected but if you look at the standings, it‚Äôs just hard to imagine Dallas keeping that pick unless they shelved Luka and went full Tankapalooza. The bottom half of the East stinks too much.
@wojespn Knicks need to pull off the deal below. Then, they can flip Hardaway (which shouldn‚Äôt be impossible) and they‚Äôd have tons of cap space for summer 2019. I still like the Hardaway/Frank N for DSJ/Matthews‚Äôs expiring idea. Dallas has no 1st so them bottoming out doesn‚Äôt make sense. https://t.co/HPF8FA3MmK

Seattle‚Äôs refusal to spread the field and unleash Wilson is honestly dumbfounding. I just don‚Äôt get it.

Cousins finishes 16 for 28 for 92 yards - legendary. Minnesota‚Äôs coaching was just as bad. Chicago barely wanted to win this game and couldn‚Äôt help themselves.

Just had my first and definitely not last convo with @HousefromDC about the Wiz tanking for pole position in the Zion Sweepstakes. I haven‚Äôt heard him this excited/focused/intense since the first Shake Shack opened in DC.

In 2015-16, Draymond was good for 14-10-7 every night with 49-39-70% shooting and the best D in the league. That guy is gone. Unclear if he‚Äôs ever coming back. He‚Äôs only 28. It‚Äôs bizarre.
It‚Äôs amazing that this never came up during 10+ hours of ABC coverage today. Seems relevant, no?
I just want to point out that Draymond has had a genuinely embarrassing season. And also, for whatever reason, can‚Äôt shoot anymore.

The hook and ladder - a play that only worked in sports movies and Friday Night Lights until December 9, 2018, when it suddenly became the most unstoppable play in the NFL.
Wow - I thought only Gronk got called for horrific OPI penalties. That‚Äôs a travesty. Worst call of the year.
Apologies to Bulls fans because I always forget to include Chicago as one of the worst-run NBA franchises. Paxson and Forman are Lloyd and Harry. https://t.co/3rsKgJfd03
Also inexplicable: a 4-man rush (that got no pressure whatsoever) so 6 d-backs and Gronk would be left to cover 75 yards of field https://t.co/nXiixgwVym
Putting Gronk out as a safety just in case a one-legged Tannehill can throw a 75-yards-in-the-air Hail Mary also might be the dumbest moment of the Belichick era.
That was the dumbest Patriots loss of the entire Belichick era.
Oh my God.
First and 10 from inside the 25 with two timeouts and under a minute left and Andy goes backwards on two plays to set up a long missed FG. Just classic. He‚Äôs such a great coach and yet this stuff happens every year with him. Every single year.

The Celtics finally started their best 5 guys and you‚Äôre not gonna believe this but it turned out to be a good idea.
2018 was already a watershed season of atrociously over-aggressive 4th-and-1 calls but this was the single worst one.
I just want to point out that Tennessee threw their season away because they handed the ball off to their 19th string tight end on a 4th and 1.
Wow, Luka is averaging 19-7-4 w/ and shooting 45-40-78% in just 33.7 mins. He's 19. I'm giving him one-name status from now on and just calling him Luka.

It‚Äôs too bad we don‚Äôt have the old All-Star set-up cuz Kyrie/Kawhi/Giannis/Embiid/Oladipo vs LeBron/KD/Curry/Harden/Davis would be a sick crunch time.
Holy shit what a game. Feels like a Game 5 of the ECF. Really nice minutes for Hayward, this is the most comfortable he‚Äôs looked. Dueling banjos with Kawhi and Kyrie in the 4Q was ridiculous. I‚Äôm running out of fingernails. Overtime!!!
This is a great game. If Toronto is putting Kawhi on Kyrie, the Celts have to exploit the Tatum/Lowry matchup. Great test for him right now.

Most fun Rozier Trade idea: Rozier to Phoenix, Boston gets the rights to swap either their 2019 Sacramento 1st or their Memphis 1st (top-8 protected) for Phoenix‚Äôs 2019 1st (make it top-1 protected) ... OR, if they decide not to swap in June, just take Phx‚Äôs 2019 2nd round pick.
The teams that make the most sense are Phoenix and Orlando, but neither team should be trading an asset to have a BETTER record this season.  Intriguing possibility: San Antonio.
Unexpected early-season Celts subplot: Terry Rozier (restricted FA next summer) has been unhappy w/ his PT all season, word has gotten around the league, and everyone now knows the Celtics need to trade him... which, of course, makes it harder to trade him.
(Please don‚Äôt trade him to the Yankees - thanks) https://t.co/3MMUNfij9P

This is my fav *new* show of 2018 other than Succession. Here‚Äôs what @aherman2006 wrote about it.  https://t.co/ItgipEbqSq via @ringer
I‚Äôm a huge Wendall Carter fan. 2018 is gonna go down as one of the best drafts of this century.
Other prob has been Rozier‚Äôs inability to thrive with less minutes. Some guys are just better as starters. Not sure he‚Äôs someone who can succeed playing 15 mins a game esp. in a contract year. He‚Äôs becoming a pretty obvious trade piece.
Hayward really hurt the Celtics on both ends tonight (and on the last play). He doesn‚Äôt look right yet. This is gonna take awhile. Really hard to justify him playing 25-30 mins a game right now - they have 8 guys who are clearly better.
Damn - Oladipo killed us late. What a battle! Those teams are really good.

Friday‚Äôs BS Podcast: a rollicking NBA conversation with @WindhorstESPN because let‚Äôs not talk about or think about any other sports.   https://t.co/21RFTEMr0n
VOICE OF REASON https://t.co/4oWEjM8We5
That felt like 2 losses and probably was.  Why have Pomeranz on the playoff roster if you won‚Äôt pitch him?  Eovaldi didn‚Äôt deserve the ‚ÄúL‚Äù - he was amazing.  The Kinsler throw is an all-timer. My great grandkids will be talking about it.
Betts and Bogaerts went 0-15.  Bogaerts made 9 outs tonight including the DP just now.  Somehow neither of them were the worst Red Sox player tonight.  Let‚Äôs go to the bottom of the 18th!
Eovaldi = Legend https://t.co/R7N0J2HW41
Larry King is dead so it‚Äôs easily more amazing that my dad it still up https://t.co/4zgoZ12OYB
Is this gonna be the Eovaldi Game or the Kinsler Game? Cuz it‚Äôs one or the other now.
Top-4 Spots of the Red Sox lineup are 0 for 26 https://t.co/GZ7BAJH4w0
If the Sox somehow win tonight then Eovaldi has to be the WS MVP favorite. Finishing last: Ian Kinsler.
If this game goes 18 innings, we should all agree to have Pedro and Koufax pitch the 19th.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll never believe that throw went where it did.  More absurd than Tyree‚Äôs helmet catch.‚Äù ‚Äî@KevinHench just now
Just coming to grips with the fact that the Dodgers scored the tying 2-out run on a check swing walk, a pop-out that carried our 3B into the stands, and a routine grounder to 2B. Wait I‚Äôm not coming to grips with this yet.
@GlobeChadFinn TOO SOON
Don‚Äôt know why we pitched to Puig but Alex Cora is a White Walker this month so I‚Äôm not questioning him.
Ok
Mookie/Xander/JD/Benintendi went 0 for 15 tonight and somehow the Sox are 3 outs away from a W.
If the Sox win this game I want to take Alex Cora to the Morongo for 2 hours of late night craps.
Bizarro Ed Armbrister alert.
Really hoping we keep that number at 23. https://t.co/YsP4kkpfkc
By rule every World Series has to have a batshit crazy extra inning game.
Wow Cora is whipping it out for this game and going for the kill. I kinda like it.
I‚Äôm glad you all got to enjoy the Heath Hembree rollercoaster ride. If you feel sick just sit down and take a couple of minutes to catch your breath.
I would have walked Machado proving yet again that Alex Cora knows way more about baseball than me. Let‚Äôs go to the 11th!
This is true https://t.co/PcpEHyZfX1
I love how Buck and Smoltz are completely ignoring that Kinsler scores on that play if he bowls over the catcher or does even a half decent headfirst slide. That throw was 6 feet off.
Kinsler careened around the bases like an 18 month old in a bouncy castle. That was a legendary WTF performance. Unbelievable.
Kinsler definitely isn‚Äôt drunk but this is also what it would be like if he was drunk.
Extras and Pomeranz looming. Need runs. Need runs. Need runs.

I love Rondo and have spent the day trying to come up with a spitting defense for him.  I‚Äôm gonna need more time.
Cowboys had a 1st down on Wash‚Äôs 37 with one timeout and 52 secs left and somehow only pulled off 2 plays (a 6-yard completion over the middle and a 3-yard run) to set up a 47-yard FB, a 5 yard penalty and a game losing 52-yard FG.  Ladies and gentlemen... THE CLAPPER! https://t.co/MLdTJnVru3

Cleveland‚Äôs coaching staff is one for the ages.
Bortles benched - only London can save him now.
Oh man - that Sony leg twist looked bad. This sucks.
Lost in that fight was Ingram‚Äôs fantastic FU shove of a whining Harden before everything escalated. That was an A+ FU shove.
I‚Äôm surprised people didn‚Äôt know about Rondo and CP - that‚Äôs been one of my favorite NBA beefs since last decade. It blew up in 2009 but I think it started even before that.  https://t.co/GhIyxr36De

https://t.co/iLWkFkj7lI
I think that‚Äôs the most clutch Red Sox catch of my lifetime. Used to be Brunansky in 1990 but considering the higher stakes and the Kimbrel Heart Attack Special in motion this one has to be #1

That‚Äôs why Mookie is the MVP. Ridiculous outfielder on top of everything else. BTW... Kimbrel for six outs is a f‚Äôn head scratcher

Everyone is gonna shit on Price for the next few days, and that‚Äôs fine, but Judge/Stanton/Sanchez/Voit is a worst-case scenario for him - 4 righties with big power. Got rattled by 2 bombs. It happens. I still think he can be an asset this month.
It‚Äôs hard to believe that the Red Sox won 108 games and also started Nunez in their first 2 playoff games.
I‚Äôm a guest DJ on @PJRadio all week with my 18 favorite @pearljam songs right now ‚Äî not ever, just right now ‚Äî on @SIRIUSXM. Here‚Äôs were my 18 songs plus the schedule.  https://t.co/StLMaHVo4P https://t.co/7Of2UaysE9

Never a doubt @drbill1947 !!!!!!!

Worst Picks Ever came within a Lions garbage time TD of going 0-3 - MISSION SUCCESS THIS SHOW HAS BEEN GREENLIT FOR ANOTHER 8 WEEKS https://t.co/ORHbDuwjUR
Devin McCourty dogged it on the first part of that Westbrook TD. Such a sloppy performance by the Pats - take this game tape and burn it. Onto the Lions.
https://t.co/3mHEqm8a9k
None of the unproven big-game Pats (Waddle, Michel, Dorsett, Patterson, Rowe etc) came through today. At least so far. Def missed Edelman/Amendola today. TB has no security blanket on 3rd and longish if Gronk is doubled.
Sam Bradford: 11 for 20 for 64 yards and a pick. He‚Äôs 34-47-1 lifetime as a starter. Never won 8 games in a season. Turns 31 in November. Keeps starting NFL games. I just don‚Äôt get it.

When you‚Äôre in this seat some day, you‚Äôll understand why I thought Zane Gonzalez could be a good kicker for us! But you‚Äôre not in this seat!!!!
Pat Mahomes is 19 years younger than Tom Brady - unless it turns out that he‚Äôs God, which would make him much older.
Best QBs ever...  1. Tom Brady 2. Joe Montana 3. Peyton Manning 4. Pat Mahomes 5. Aaron Rodgers
Seemed like Big Ben was a solid yard over the line when he threw that last TD. I‚Äôve never been more consistently wrong about anything than the whole ‚ÄúWas that QB was over the line when he threw that?‚Äù question. I‚Äôm like 2 for 131 career.
I gambled on an Andy Reid team that burst out to a 21-0 lead, had the game-clinching TD called back on a penalty and now seems to be losing momentum... I mean, what could go wrong?

My buddy @jimgrady23 (lifelong Jets fan) is convinced Sam Darnold can save the Jets because he looks like Rudy. They definitely have the same barber. https://t.co/UOn91DL1vz
Thoroughly enjoyed ‚ÄúLove, Gilda,‚Äù the new documentary about Gilda Radner. Learned a few things and it triggered a ton of memories. It‚Äôs very well done. I continue to think she‚Äôs the best female SNL cast member ever (and now we‚Äôre almost at the half-century mark).

New BS Podcast: The Rodgers Resurrection, Mahomes Mania, Browns-Steelers craziness, Tampa‚Äôs parlay destruction, Parent Corner and guessing Week 2 Lines w/ @TheCousinSal - enjoy, night owls!!!  https://t.co/FjqChaeRLQ
I knew it https://t.co/W0d4AVdwR5
Fine, fine, @TheCousinSal and I will do a Sunday night emergency pod... twist our arms Aaron Rodgers.
The Bears came into this game with 25 plays - it‚Äôs like the Jags in New England last January, they ran thru the 25 and now they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúUm....‚Äù
https://t.co/51KjY66xjs
The sequel! https://t.co/pctTxp6Pv0
I was 2 minutes too early https://t.co/e2goSubCve
You know what‚Äôs a bad idea? Trading Khalil Mack.
Uh oh
My bad - he shanked it, only went 63 yards. Come on Dickson that was supposed to go 75.
Monster game saving Dickson punt coming
These ridiculous Michael Dickson punts are bouncing right off Dick Stockton - somebody get Dick some coffee. https://t.co/GX6hTy24E8
The Clapper in mid season form https://t.co/EeY5snQZQY
Dropped passes, blown coverage, untimely turnovers, bizarre coaching decisions... the Chargers are back!!!!!
Mahomes! My Chiefs-Rams SB pick!!!!!! Mahomes!!!!!!!!!!!
The punter is Seattle‚Äôs best player - hopefully Pete Carroll won‚Äôt favor him and turn the locker room against him.
Cam was 40-1 for MVP before the year ‚Äî Jimmy G was 16-1 https://t.co/0arcpTJrhC
All 243 remaining Chargers fans are furious at their shoddy receivers today - some killer drops. Interesting game so far. Chiefs are going to be in some high-scoring games.
Everyone made Peterman jokes for 3 hours (and with reason) but it‚Äôs not like Tyrod is good.
If the Browns tie, they need to dump Gatorade on Hue Jackson.
Only winner of this Browns/Steelers game is Baker Mayfield.
The Browns winning the turnover battle 5-0 and losing by 7 at home. We‚Äôre gonna be remembering the Hue Jackson era for the rest of our lives.
Welcome to the Red Zone Channel, Saquon!!!!! We‚Äôve been waiting for you!
Jameis is a year away from being the face of the XFL.
Drops, penalties, dumb decisions and squandered opportunities - what Hard Knocks fan could have seen this day coming for the Browns?
It‚Äôs 3:13 ET and you‚Äôre officially allowed to panic about your Saints parlay/teaser/elimination pick.
Pittsburgh‚Äôs o-line‚Äôs euphoric over the top reactions to James Conner TDs are high comedy.
The announcers were just praising Hue Jackson / the Browns have 3 forced turnovers but 0 points. I missed football so much.
Wow - Bill O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs last 2 minutes in this Pats game were like a resignation letter.
Nice to have Andrew Luck back. He looks good.  Also nice to have Bill O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs clock management back.
Hue Jackson‚Äôs bold strategy of throwing away his offense to keep putting the ball in Roethlisberger‚Äôs hands is really starting to pay off.
Nobody is allowed to panic until 3 ET but swearing and throwing stuff is fine https://t.co/zk99vaZQIE
Every time they show Sean McDermott on the Bills sideline, it seems like he should be sadly chugging from a flask.
If Roethlisberger retires tomorrow, I think there‚Äôs still time for him to get a good TV job.
Tampa knows about everyone‚Äôs seemingly easy parlay or tease with the Saints and they‚Äôre gonna make us work for it. Buckle up.
Lemme know when you want me to overreact with my first ‚ÄúRoethlisberger looks washed‚Äù tweet of the season.
The first Bengal has been ejected - we‚Äôve officially started the 2018 season.
Let‚Äôs all enjoy these last few minutes before we start to hate ourselves because of our crummy fantasy teams and poor gambling instincts. FOOTBALL!

I mean at least the Falcons are consistent.
Can NBC make it seem like the uprights are covered in burning orange flames? I can‚Äôt remember where they are on the field.
Still think facemasking penalties should be 5, 15, 25, 50 and 75 yards. Making Sproles‚Äôs head do a 360 is a 50 yarder right? If his head came off that‚Äôs 75 yards.
Just googled... ‚ÄúIs Matt Ryan hurt?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with Matt Ryan?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow old is Matt Ryan?‚Äù ‚ÄúMatt Ryan Tommy John Surgery‚Äù
It‚Äôs been 2 hours and we have 20 things to complain about already. The NFL is back!
Can NBC make the end zone pulsate with white colors? I‚Äôm a moron and I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out where the end zone is.
I genuinely hate NBC‚Äôs ‚Äúdarken the first down territory on the field‚Äù gimmick. Please no more. It‚Äôs ludicrous. How does this idea escape an ideas meeting?
I missed Atlanta‚Äôs red zone offense!
Football! Football! Football! Football! Football!

In 2001, thx to a trade, the Celts could've grabbed Denver's 1st rounder (no. 11) OR rolled it over to 2002 (top-3 protected), 2003 (top-1) or 2004 (unprotected).   They grabbed the pick and selected... Kedrick Brown.   Denver's next 2 years: 27-55, 17-63.  THIS STILL HURTS.

It‚Äôs amazing how many NBA teams panic and make all their roster moves in July/August. Like Atlanta ‚Äî they had OKC over a barrel w/ Melo, nobody else could have absorbed that money. Why not wait, you only get more leverage as season starts and OKC is freaking about their tax bill.
I APOLOGIZE FOR LEAVING OUT ORLANDO - MY BAD
The lesson for GMs, as always: any time you‚Äôre in a pinch, just keep calling Sacramento, Phoenix, Charlotte or Atlanta and it will work out.
Houston did it again - Anderson‚Äôs contract was untradeable and they somehow flipped it into Knight‚Äôs contract which is absolutely tradeable. Now they can trade Knight + a 1st + $$$ and get an expensive wing who‚Äôs actually decent-to-good. Bazemore at worst. GSW should be pissed.

I actually think Melo is a good one year trade risk for a fringe contender like Portland because his game SHOULD age well. What happened to him last season doesn‚Äôt totally make sense. Might have just been wrong team/wrong fit in OKC. Not impossible.
It‚Äôs odd that Wade + Melo became crazy-expensive untradeable liabilities in back to back summers. Makes sense in 1988, 1998 or even 2008 but not in 2018 when so many stars have extended their primes. Melo - no major injuries, not a ton of playoff games, only 34. No real excuses. https://t.co/3F2KEBg5Tq
I would have enjoyed Equalizer 2 regardless, but Denzel playing a revenge-seeking Lyft driver in Boston really pushed it over the top for me.
I‚Äôm gonna spend the rest of the summer trying to find one Lakers fan who‚Äôd rather have KCP at 1-year/12m than Julius Randle at 2 years/18m with a player option for Year 2.

It‚Äôs a bad sign when Chris Harrison is the most dynamic part of the season.

What‚Äôs funny is... (A) He‚Äôs actually a good bench guy (B) Somebody should absolutely claim him  (C) Nobody will because the NBA is dumb (D) We‚Äôve seen 20 idiotic free agency overpays already, and somehow GSW will get a helpful bench guy for like 15 bucks an hour. https://t.co/8YKmAsbcnh

Let‚Äôs go Colombia!!!!!! I never stopped believing!!!!!!
I still think LeBron is going to LA - but if the Sixers can create a Simmons/Embiid/Kawhi/LeBron scenario for him, how does he not seriously consider that?
The terrifying version of this obviously...  If they can figure out how to get Kawhi AND LeBron.
So @sam_amick is reporting that the Spurs will only trade Kawhi to the East. Philly has to be heavy favs - cap space to absorb Kawhi/Patty Mills plus 3 of Fultz/Saric/Covington/ZSmith plus that killer 2021 Miami pick plus Bayless expiring.  https://t.co/uAakatyUF1

Doncic dropping to 3 for no real reason reminds me of the 2005 Draft when Chris Paul was clearly the best guy in the draft and somehow went 4th.  https://t.co/ljgEI4uBkU
The @Ringer Draft-Day Mock Draft goes Ayton/Bagley/Doncic as the top-3... so basically the best player will go third. Makes sense.  https://t.co/mwuaQhmaWz

It‚Äôs the 20th anniversary of one of the last drafts that had this many dumbass front offices in the top-10 was 1998 - that was the one when Dirk and Pierce fell to 9 and 10. (And BTW the Pitino Celts were dumbasses too - even they knew they had to take Pierce.)

@KevinOConnorNBA @ringer Not saying this would be enough - just saying that‚Äôs what they could cobble together (and also take Plumlee‚Äôs contract back).
@KevinOConnorNBA @ringer Celts could pull off Rozier, Morris, Yabusele, the 27th pick and the Kings/Grizzlies future picks for 3 and Plumlee‚Äôs deal (12.5m next 2 years).

1 other topic discussed with House ‚Äî are we SURE Phoenix is taking Ayton 1st? It‚Äôs 24 hours before the draft and nobody knows. Doncic was +1500 to go first when we taped the pod. I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if Phx took him.

61 for Durant and Curry tonight.  54 for LeBron and Green last night.  You need your superstars in a Game 7.
That was meant to be a Brooks/Donovan tweet!
That‚Äôs a great win.  Coming back from 12+ on the road to win a Round 3 Game 7 is a legitimate achievement and we just saw teams do it on back to back nights.  (Granted, we also saw the home teams miss 259 combined threes. But still.)

LeBron was awesome.   And yet - winnable game for the Celts. Cleveland‚Äôs offensive rebounding and all the missed FT‚Äôs really killed Boston. Too many second chance points. Oh well. Game 7!!!!!!!!!
Remember that Tatum 3 just there / usually takes one shot to get him going. This is an unusually unsafe double digit lead with no Love and LeBron on pace for 48 by the way.
Here come the touch fouls...
I‚Äôd love to see my face 25 years ago if someone told me the league‚Äôs best player was going to play all 48 minutes in a must-win playoff game during his 15th season with 53,000 NBA minutes on his odometer already.
Any time Jeff Green scores more than 5 points in a half against your playoff team it feels like getting your credit cards stolen.
Two shots in 18+ minutes for Tatum. üò°
I‚Äôm weirdly confident.
New BS Podcast: Are the Cavs alive and kicking? Are the Warriors dead? Why does that Quinn Cook shot explain everything? I talk it out w/ @ChrisRyan77 ... plus - how the Rockets win Game 6 without CP, and a long interview with Johnny Knoxville.  https://t.co/ggRtKMP3lU
Agree with this + there‚Äôs no way they could let Hanley get enough ABs for the 22m option to kick in, so unhappy Hanley losing ABs isn‚Äôt worth the risk. This team is too talented. Will be interesting to see if they can deal him. BTW - @redsoxstats is a great follow for Sox fans. https://t.co/d3wEZPBBvJ

If I could change one pick it would be Gobert over Horford. That crazy winning stretch Utah had ended up swaying me and I overrated it. Horford played way more games and meant just as much. Oh well.
Can‚Äôt believe DeRozan made 2nd  team over Oladipo (better 2-way player, meant more to his team, slightly better stats). Just weird.  Simmons over PG for 3rd team was a no brainer for me. BS was fantastic last 2 months.  I couldn‚Äôt vote for Curry - he missed 40% of the season.
KD vs Giannis for 2nd forward spot was unfair. Didnt love how KD ended reg. season but he‚Äôs a top-3 guy and I didn‚Äôt think he should lose that spot unless Giannis took it. The Bucks just weren‚Äôt good enough and G tailed off a little late.

My All-NBA ballot was...  1ST James, LeBron  Durant, Kevin  Davis, Anthony Harden, James Lillard, Damian   2ND Antetokounmpo, Giannis Towns, Karl-Anthony Embiid, Joel Oladipo, Victor Westbrook, Russell  3RD Aldridge, LaMarcus Simmons, Ben Gobert, Rudy DeRozan, DeMar Paul, Chris

I didn‚Äôt assign this piece https://t.co/dRiLw21Wz1
That game never regained its flow after the Nance/Morris incident - was like watching one of those rock fights from the Ben Wallace era.
This game will never be on ESPN Classic.
The fans are now pleading for Tatum to shoot like we are trying to save a child trapped in a well.
Roof was gonna come off for That Tatum 3... in and out... Cavs keep hanging around...
Rozier hit the Unexpected Playoff Hero Wall. Get up Terry!
LeBron‚Äôs footwork on those 5-sequence spinning downhill drives is incredible. It‚Äôs almost like he invented a new way to post up.
The only Celtic that worries the Cavs in halfcourt is Tatum - they are happy when anyone else is shooting. Celts need to iso him at top. LET THE CHEF BAKE!!!
I didn‚Äôt realize Larry Nance Jr and Jordan Clarkson were still on the Cavs.
Go to the hoop Jayson. Go to the hoop Jayson. Go to the hoop Jayson. Go to the hoop Jason.

Tonight‚Äôs key Celts: Smart, Horford   Tonight‚Äôs key questions: ‚ÄîWill the Celts continue to treat LeBron like its an honor + a privilege to play him, or will they start fighting/scrapping/clawing like he‚Äôs in their way?  ‚ÄîWill Tatum ever realize that JR Smith can‚Äôt guard him?
I‚Äôm in Boston and the sun is shining and the entire city is preparing to battle LeBron.  Possible chants for tonight‚Äôs game...  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a ba-by‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease stop cry-ing‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not M-J‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will leave. You will leave.‚Äù  (Crap - you‚Äôre right, he‚Äôs a machine, none of this will work)
Just watched 4Q again. Ariza and Tucker were phenomenal. I can‚Äôt remember GSW taking that many bad shots in a 4Q since 2016 Game 7 Finals. Houston‚Äôs D was great. That‚Äôs a tough team.
Cannot understand why CP3 made the free throw...
Cannot understand why KD gave up the ball...
THIS IS A CLASSIC
Rockets are scrapping, clawing, retaliating and talking shit ‚Äî this is exactly what the Celts didn‚Äôt do last night, they were way too deferential to LeBron especially (with the exception of Smart).
Here comes James Harden!!!!
This is a tragic month for Chris Paul‚Äôs max extension.
I told @haralabob pregame that I wanted the Rockets to unleash Eric Gordon tonight and that he was their secret sauce... Of course I also told him that the Rockets would cover +8.
When did the Lineup of Death officially become the Hampton 5? Was there a vote? I didn‚Äôt get to vote.
This strategy is also used in my son‚Äôs 10-and-under League. https://t.co/2RYu76QHza via @ringer
I went with 70-80%
Curious what you think... how healthy is Chris Paul right now? I will put my guess below. I thnk it‚Äôs the biggest reason this Rockets Line is so high (+8???) in a must win game 4 without Iggy.

Tatum refusing to just take JR off the dribble and score every time is damaging my internal organs.
This is the dumbest basketball Boston has played for these entire playoffs. Guess they were due for one of these but man.
Cannot figure out why Smart came out. They had it going defensively when he was out there.
Been waiting for Smart on LeBron. At least make him work a little.
LeBron: 34 of 36 mins, 35 pts, 21 FGA, 14 FTA ... and it‚Äôs a physical game.
Ty Lue did a good job in these 2 games. Smart adjustments. Not entirely sure how the Celts are only down 10. Nobody is playing well.
The Cavs aren‚Äôt playing ‚Äúbetter defense‚Äù - they‚Äôre grabbing and clutching everyone off the ball on every play. It‚Äôs really smart. Watch what they do to Tatum and Brown off the ball. It‚Äôs throwing them both off.
I‚Äôm not even gonna say it.

Re-watched 2nd half of Cavs-Celts. Jeff Green + JR Smith were like Bizarro Robert Horry and Bizarro Manu Ginobili. So awful. I can‚Äôt imagine LeBron‚Äôs reaction when he watched the tape.

OK I jinxed that one....
Thanks for the 5-point play JR.
JR Smith was the worst player in this game so naturally he made the dirtiest play of the game.
Celts missing easy shots and making dumb plays... letting LeBron hang around....
Halftime reading https://t.co/zaRaug40Px
Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing Scary Terry show up for the second half.
Tatum has done this all season - goes thru mini funks, makes one shot and suddenly he‚Äôs totally fine.
LeBron is on pace for 100 points and the Cavs are only up 5.
Celts are playing the wrong pace - this is too slow, they need to push the ball and make Cleveland run. Also / Morris killing the Celts.
Luka and Booker is the League Pass backcourt we need.

My hero https://t.co/XkOSZvMORW
Tyronn Lue threw the damn towel for Game 1 - Game 2 in 51 hours.
Tatum can get any shot he wants against this Cavs team - I‚Äôd bet that once Boston got the big lead Stevens decided to save that particular wrinkle for Game 2.
Until they call him for stepping over the line on a free throw shot (which he does every time) https://t.co/87POBZnxDp
And just like that... they washed the stink off.
That was the first stretch of boneheaded basketball in a long time for the Celtics. Got too comfy with the big lead.
Celts need to go back to attacking the basket - Cleveland has no rim protection. Tatum needs to take over a little. Key couple mins here. LeBron is definitely lurking.
That was the first time Jaylen has looked like Jaylen since the Bucks series. He was at like 60-70% for most of that Sixers series.
Can somebody at this game scream ‚ÄúGO TO THE BASKET JAYSON!!!!!‚Äù for me?
This is the ideal shot chart for the 1st quarter (and this whole series) if you‚Äôre the Celtics. https://t.co/dBcnH32BAb

Or, think of it this way...  Morris and Ojeleye averaged 39.6 MPG and shot 31% in the Philly series.   What if a healthy Hayward had 36 of those 39.6 minutes every game? https://t.co/GbY4a6PHTg
Jayson Tatum played 29 games and 966 minutes at Duke last year as a freshman.  He‚Äôs played 92 games and 2,861 minutes with the Celtics (and still going) as a rookie.  Last 7 playoff games: 22.9 PPG, 51-31-84%, 7.3 FTA, 37.3 MPG.
I feel bad that LeBron James doesn‚Äôt have any help in the 2018 Playoffs.  Oh wait, here are the active 2018 payrolls for our 2 Eastern Conference Finalists (not counting Hayward, Irving, Larkin and Theis, all of whom are out).  Cavs: $135.7 million Celts: $65.2 million.

Celts were down 22 in Game 2  Down 5 late in OT in Game 3.  Down 4 with 90 secs left in Game 5.  I‚Äôm still kind of in shock. Hard to remember a more lovable Celtics team. Jayson Tatum needs a fake ID to get into bars and he‚Äôs a go-to Guy on a Conference Finalist. What???
here's our live postgame Ringer NBA Show from tonight... https://t.co/jcaNiCZGRO
Amazing - only six years ago! https://t.co/1HYcwWzxIa
That won‚Äôt be our last Sixers-Celtics playoff series with those guys. Kudos to Embiid - was so much fun/scary to root against that guy tonight.
My fav moment of that game was Smart yelling at Stevens to keep him on Saric at the end right before that key turnover. ‚ÄúI GOT THIS!‚Äù He was screaming. Then after - ‚ÄúI TOLD YOU!‚Äù I fucking love that guy.
No threes no threes no threes
Can‚Äôt believe that JJ 3 didn‚Äôt go in... that was a potential dagger.
Average Al being average.
Tense tense tense tense. Gotta say, the Sixers seem super confident on their bench.
This is gonna be a fascinating fourth quarter. Crowd got taken out of it. Boston desperately needs Tatum to get going - he can get any shot he wants. Philly has to play Embiid with shooters if Bos is doubling right?
Embiid has been awesome tonight.  Very loud 21 points. But will he get tired in the fourth???
Only @GlobeBobRyan is gonna get this reference but Anderson is like Mike Riordan in Game 4 of the ‚Äò74 Finals - he‚Äôs just here to start a fight with Smart.
Brett Brown down to 2 timeouts - i think he thinks you can buy more of them or something.
What a way to end the half. It was LOUD in here. BBrown helped with all those subs - 76ers could never stay in a flow, he was changing lines like it was hockey.
Morris and Covington deadlocked in a ‚Äúwho can murder their team more tonight?‚Äù duel.
(I like this move - Smart is such an immediate energy boost off the bench especially at home, I hate when it starts.) https://t.co/RqESlUpa0F
Concerned about Game 5. Without Larkin the Celts only have 4 guys (Smart, Rozier, Tatum and not-healthy Jaylen) chasing around Philly‚Äôs shooters. Very little lineup flexibility and BBrown knows to go smaller now. Crowd needs to be an ‚Äò86 Walton level 6th man tonight.
Shout out to everyone in the 916. #neverforget
I‚Äôm Team Chuck in all feuds with Shaq - but he‚Äôs wrong about the 00-02 Lakers. Shaq carried those 3 teams, his 3 Finals were legit ridiculous, and his 1999-2000 season was an all-timer. Shaq wins those 3 titles with any All-NBA sidekick plus Dick Bavetta. He was dominant.

I still haven't read the right feature about the difficulties in tracking podcast traffic and how it's like the Wild Wild West even now in 2018 with all the money that's flowing in... even Apple's podcast rankings are flawed and pretty easy to exploit if you want to cheat.
There still isn't a foolproof way to measure podcast traffic. The closest is probably Apple's episode charts, which measures total downloads within 24 hours of a new episode posting, but even then - Apple usually generates 60-70% of someone's podcast traffic and that's it.
To get tracked by Podtrac, you have to sign up with them, then redirect your RSS feed to them so they can track the traffic. We didn't do this for a variety of reasons. Neither does any podcast that uses @midrollmedia for ad sales.
In this podcast boom piece, the writer relies on Podtrac for download info/rankings/conclusions but never mentions that The @Ringer + many other pods do NOT allow Podtrac to track their data. Only pods that sign up with Podtrac get "ranked" by them.   https://t.co/q8mIg8CjpY
