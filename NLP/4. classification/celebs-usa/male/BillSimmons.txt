Last Celtics play was supposed to be a back door screen and a lob to Morris but Middleton basically tackled him - that’s why Morris was mad after the game. Typical shit ending to a 2019 Celtics game.

Just say “It’s a huge city with great fans and a fantastic arena.” That’s literally all you can say about the Knicks.
They’re wrapping up a 2-decade freefall, their owner is a league-wide joke, it’s the NBA’s most paranoid organization, they’ve hired horrendously and overpaid the wrong free agents over and over again, they’ve had 12 coaches in 17 years, and they’ve won 4 Finals games since 1973. https://t.co/0WvJRLpgvd

Anyway — “we all have to do better” means absolutely nothing when you’ve created a super-league that only allows well-funded mega-clubs who all play the exact same style. Put some thought into this, Christian. You could actually make a difference.
My daughter’s team won the Gold Coast League (and went undefeated), is top-20 in SoCal, doesn’t play kickball and even has an innovative social media presence. We can’t get into ECNL unless we get swallowed up by a mega-club. That’s a good system?  https://t.co/IGxOdKyYkV
To me “We all have to do better” means “Let’s think about changing a system that obviously doesn’t work.” Building ECNL  around mega-clubs + a kickball style that’s built to win tournament games but doesn’t actually teach kids how to play soccer — that’s not changing the system.
This all sounds great but why do they only allow big corporate mega-clubs in ECNL and not any successful independent clubs with coaches who think outside the box? Why can’t indie clubs earn their way in for a year? Why don’t they have relegation?  https://t.co/PJ2jnSjtTm

New BS Podcast w/ @chrisbosh — we discussed the AD/Pelicans saga, the decade of NBA player empowerment, best 21st century power forwards, Lebron’s arc as a brand ... and he talked me off the ledge about the NBA turning into AAU.  https://t.co/Kz2lJNlvjd
Unfortunately, there are only 3-4 true contenders every year. If you’re an NBA star, there’s an 80-85 percent chance you’re not going to be completely satisfied with your competitive situation. And by the way the next situation probably won’t be great either. See: Kyrie, 2019.
I don’t know how the NBA can fix this specific issue, but it completely undermines the concept of a team: Stars grabbing max deals while thinking, “I’ll grab the money now, and if we don’t get better, I’ll just push for a trade.” AKA... Pulling a Carmelo.
Fans and media have become numb to NBA players doing whatever the F they want. Davis could have waited until this summer to do this — instead he imploded the situation for leverage, it didn’t work, and now he’s pretending to be the victim. “I want to play.” This is so lame.
AD now “wants to play” — after snaking his franchise on a Monday to launch a news cycle, undermining his own trade value, having his agents repeatedly leak stuff to the media, and trying to force a trade to a specific team with a year and a half left on his deal.
This situation is ludicrous. It’s been a fun NBA season on the court and an absolute train wreck off the court. If you sign a massive deal to be someone’s max player — here’s an idea, show up every night and be their best player. What are you doing AD???? https://t.co/sSD0ofl4Wf

Let’s make that the last time Marcus Smart isn’t out there in a one point game under 30 seconds please.
That was the biggest win LeBron’s gonna have all season.
Giannis going with three centers — he thinks it’s 1985. He’s still better than Chris Wallace.
This is the NBA’s greatest idea in like 5 years. The Davis/tampering part was great.

I like Harris and got to watch him here — great teammate, plays hard, hits open shots. He’s also been traded four times and he’s in a contract year. This trade was weird.
That Sixers trade felt desperate - gave up way too much for an expiring FA. And throwing Shamet in the deal was just weird. But fundamentally...  their crunch-time 5 is flawed now. No lineup flexibility, nobody to defend the Kyrie types. Why not make same offer for Jrue Holiday?
How the hell did the Clippers get two firsts, including that great 2021 Miami pick, for a non All-Star who was leaving in 3 months? The Jerry West/Clippers era is amazing.

Kyrie needs to stop talking about leadership - he’s terrible at it. He’s incredibly fun to watch, but if they traded him within the next 6 days... I’d honestly be fine with it. Go to New York in July and play for the worst NBA owner of the 21st century. Good luck. https://t.co/EIH3EQKCKK
FYI: the odds of Porzingis signing a huge extension w/ Dallas this summer are 99.99%  Qualifying offer for 2019-20: 5.7m, one year   Dallas extension: 28m in 2019-20, 125-130m range for 4 years.  So he’d just leave 22+ mill on the table for 2020 w/ his injury history? No way.

Tremendous Rams drive. I love how they used the clock — especially obeying the Lombardi Law and not spiking it after they got the long play to Cooks for goal to go with 40 secs left. So many dumbass teams spike it there.
The Rams need to hypnotize Gurley and make him think he’s playing the 2-10 Cardinals in late November.
Incredible fake punt by the Rams. Really enjoyed it. They needed to do something — this game had 40-0 potential.

Perkins makes honorable mention but I can’t remember him truly snapping during a Celts game.
Since I’ve been a Celts fan we’ve had 3 guys who weren’t “hold me back” guys during bad blood moments and genuinely wanted to fight if they were pissed: Cowens, Bird and Smart.   ***Not sure about Marcus Morris cuz I’ve never seen anyone provoke him. Probably not a good idea.
Wait... this hadn’t happened yet??? What the hell? https://t.co/GAHDtgFu7I
I thought the Fyre Festival doc on Netflix was excellent. Here’s what @harvilla wrote about that one and the Hulu one  https://t.co/AiPZngz23Z
I still think Tatum has a chance to be great. He has every shot and trick you’d want from a 6’8 forward - but how he’s using those shots/tricks (and how he’s being used) continues to be perplexing. This is the most important thing for Stevens to fix these last 3 months.
My take: Tatum’s game always falls into place when he’s attacking the rim and drawing fouls. Also think they could post him up more esp. against smaller players. He’s only taken 8+ FTA in 5 of 40 games this season which just doesn’t make sense to me.
Jayson Tatum was 0-6 last night vs. Memphis. Here’s his per-36 numbers last year/this year. Strangest subplot of a strange Celtics season — good young players almost always make a leap in Year 2. Cannot figure this out. https://t.co/aGgW8pNxo5

Anyway — @ZachLowe_NBA and I discussed this on Tuesday’s BS Pod before everything that happened last night.  https://t.co/ABGywJLYGb
Also — it’s OK not to talk after a game, or say anything interesting. It really is. It’s a long season. You can go 6 weeks being a press conference robot and giving generic quotes. It’s fine.
The best 2000s superstar leaders were Duncan, Dirk and Nash. All of them avoided discussing locker room issues publicly. I think Curry handles stuff well too. None of them would have beaten this “These young guys are ridiculous, they don’t know how to win” card into the ground.
Agree with @tomecurran — Kyrie’s latest story about calling LeBron was a fancy way of saying publicly that he’s playing with some young, immature dickheads who reminded him of his former self. Whether it was intentional or inadvertent — I dunno. But he should really stop talking.

Westbrook’s extended shooting slump is the best thing that could have happened to him - when he’s pass-first OKC is so much more dangerous. He’s actually fun to play with now.
As discussed on Zach Lowe’s pod yesterday — I like this weird OKC team as a 20-1 title long shot. They know who they are and they play exceptionally hard. In the playoffs when everything gets tense/physical/ugly it’s going to play in their favor.

@wojespn Sac could also keep Shump and throw Koufos’s expiring into that Knicks deal. They have a bunch of expirings. They don’t have their 1st either so they should be trying to turn expirings into 1-2 more playoff guys if they make it. I like Kanter as an off the bench playoff banger.
@wojespn Should clarify — That Dallas pick heading to Atlanta is top-5 protected but if you look at the standings, it’s just hard to imagine Dallas keeping that pick unless they shelved Luka and went full Tankapalooza. The bottom half of the East stinks too much.
@wojespn Knicks need to pull off the deal below. Then, they can flip Hardaway (which shouldn’t be impossible) and they’d have tons of cap space for summer 2019. I still like the Hardaway/Frank N for DSJ/Matthews’s expiring idea. Dallas has no 1st so them bottoming out doesn’t make sense. https://t.co/HPF8FA3MmK

THE GREATEST COVER EVER!!!!!!!!
I’m disappointed / Was hoping Seattle would be down 6 and running a 2-minute offense of Chris Carson runs up the middle into 6 guys.
This game is gonna end with Brian Schottenheimer running into the field and ripping off his shirt to reveal a Cowboys jersey:
Seattle’s refusal to spread the field and unleash Wilson is honestly dumbfounding. I just don’t get it.

@justin_halpern No he’s Shannon Doherty
In 2015-16, Draymond was good for 14-10-7 every night with 49-39-70% shooting and the best D in the league. That guy is gone. Unclear if he’s ever coming back. He’s only 28. It’s bizarre.
It’s amazing that this never came up during 10+ hours of ABC coverage today. Seems relevant, no?
I just want to point out that Draymond has had a genuinely embarrassing season. And also, for whatever reason, can’t shoot anymore.

Not sure “guts” is the word that I’d go with for that fake punt call, Tony.

Gronk has been taken out of the garage.
And then a few plays later hit Celek for a long TD. Guess which Niners TE I have in the fantasy playoffs? #fantasyisevil #needtoquit #ihateit https://t.co/pB8KieoqE6

Trubisky and Goff have thrown for 212 yards combined and 6 picks so far, but even that’s not as weird as Gurley only getting 8 touches.
14 Russians - that’s enough to field an NBA team with one DNP guy in street clothes.   https://t.co/PU5Ap36umZ
The hook and ladder - a play that only worked in sports movies and Friday Night Lights until December 9, 2018, when it suddenly became the most unstoppable play in the NFL.
Wow - I thought only Gronk got called for horrific OPI penalties. That’s a travesty. Worst call of the year.
Apologies to Bulls fans because I always forget to include Chicago as one of the worst-run NBA franchises. Paxson and Forman are Lloyd and Harry. https://t.co/3rsKgJfd03
Also inexplicable: a 4-man rush (that got no pressure whatsoever) so 6 d-backs and Gronk would be left to cover 75 yards of field https://t.co/nXiixgwVym
Putting Gronk out as a safety just in case a one-legged Tannehill can throw a 75-yards-in-the-air Hail Mary also might be the dumbest moment of the Belichick era.
That was the dumbest Patriots loss of the entire Belichick era.
Oh my God.
First and 10 from inside the 25 with two timeouts and under a minute left and Andy goes backwards on two plays to set up a long missed FG. Just classic. He’s such a great coach and yet this stuff happens every year with him. Every single year.
I forgot what it was like to bet on Andy Reid in close games.

This is a classic “Pats at Miami” game. Two blocked punts, triple the passing yards, 8+ more mins of possession thru 2 1/2 quarters and somehow we’re only up 6.

This is Brady’s best hour of the season - just phenomenal football from him, looks like he’s 28.
Minnesota’s refusal to run the ball against the Patriots last week was really crazy. Anyone can move the ball on the Pats with speed out of the backfield on runs/screens/wheel routes.

The Celtics finally started their best 5 guys and you’re not gonna believe this but it turned out to be a good idea.
2018 was already a watershed season of atrociously over-aggressive 4th-and-1 calls but this was the single worst one.
I just want to point out that Tennessee threw their season away because they handed the ball off to their 19th string tight end on a 4th and 1.
Wow, Luka is averaging 19-7-4 w/ and shooting 45-40-78% in just 33.7 mins. He's 19. I'm giving him one-name status from now on and just calling him Luka.

Not a great sign for the Rams Super Bowl hopes that I have the Chiefs +3.5 and never gave up during any of the 11 times they blew this game.
This week in Roger Goodell...  1. Allows NBC to flex a Bears game to Sunday night even though they’re playing in Detroit on Thursday 12:30pm  2. Only moves tonight’s game from Mexico City after the players threaten to sit out b/c of the field conditions.  https://t.co/T5u4mYwx2L

It’s too bad we don’t have the old All-Star set-up cuz Kyrie/Kawhi/Giannis/Embiid/Oladipo vs LeBron/KD/Curry/Harden/Davis would be a sick crunch time.
Holy shit what a game. Feels like a Game 5 of the ECF. Really nice minutes for Hayward, this is the most comfortable he’s looked. Dueling banjos with Kawhi and Kyrie in the 4Q was ridiculous. I’m running out of fingernails. Overtime!!!
This is a great game. If Toronto is putting Kawhi on Kyrie, the Celts have to exploit the Tatum/Lowry matchup. Great test for him right now.

Hey Vegas - come see Russillo, Mays and Clark talk football on Monday night.

Most fun Rozier Trade idea: Rozier to Phoenix, Boston gets the rights to swap either their 2019 Sacramento 1st or their Memphis 1st (top-8 protected) for Phoenix’s 2019 1st (make it top-1 protected) ... OR, if they decide not to swap in June, just take Phx’s 2019 2nd round pick.
The teams that make the most sense are Phoenix and Orlando, but neither team should be trading an asset to have a BETTER record this season.  Intriguing possibility: San Antonio.
Unexpected early-season Celts subplot: Terry Rozier (restricted FA next summer) has been unhappy w/ his PT all season, word has gotten around the league, and everyone now knows the Celtics need to trade him... which, of course, makes it harder to trade him.
(Please don’t trade him to the Yankees - thanks) https://t.co/3MMUNfij9P

Fascinating Celts-Nuggets game in Denver tonight. Celts are settling for too many 3s, aren’t going to the hole enough, haven’t figured out their best 5-man lineups yet, and don’t have anyone to defend Jokic. Chemistry looks a little off. Great spot for Denver who’s playing well.

Cleveland hosted one in 1997. Some pretty enticing NBA cities haven’t hosted an ASG since before that.  Miami: 1990 Boston: 1964 Milwaukee: 1977 Seattle: 1987  Salt Lake: 1993 Portland: Never San Francisco: Never  (PS: The ballsy move for the 75th ASG was Seattle.)
This doesn’t pass the smell test. We just had 4 straight NBA Finals in Cleveland. Everyone in the extended NBA universe went there every June.   It’s almost like Dan Gilbert threatened to make a huge stink about the Lakers tam- (uh-oh I’m being tasered)  https://t.co/WkpBVB5kEl

This is my fav *new* show of 2018 other than Succession. Here’s what @aherman2006 wrote about it.  https://t.co/ItgipEbqSq via @ringer
I’m a huge Wendall Carter fan. 2018 is gonna go down as one of the best drafts of this century.
Other prob has been Rozier’s inability to thrive with less minutes. Some guys are just better as starters. Not sure he’s someone who can succeed playing 15 mins a game esp. in a contract year. He’s becoming a pretty obvious trade piece.
Hayward really hurt the Celtics on both ends tonight (and on the last play). He doesn’t look right yet. This is gonna take awhile. Really hard to justify him playing 25-30 mins a game right now - they have 8 guys who are clearly better.
Damn - Oladipo killed us late. What a battle! Those teams are really good.

Friday’s BS Podcast: a rollicking NBA conversation with @WindhorstESPN because let’s not talk about or think about any other sports.   https://t.co/21RFTEMr0n
VOICE OF REASON https://t.co/4oWEjM8We5
That felt like 2 losses and probably was.  Why have Pomeranz on the playoff roster if you won’t pitch him?  Eovaldi didn’t deserve the “L” - he was amazing.  The Kinsler throw is an all-timer. My great grandkids will be talking about it.
Betts and Bogaerts went 0-15.  Bogaerts made 9 outs tonight including the DP just now.  Somehow neither of them were the worst Red Sox player tonight.  Let’s go to the bottom of the 18th!
Eovaldi = Legend https://t.co/R7N0J2HW41
Larry King is dead so it’s easily more amazing that my dad it still up https://t.co/4zgoZ12OYB
Is this gonna be the Eovaldi Game or the Kinsler Game? Cuz it’s one or the other now.
Top-4 Spots of the Red Sox lineup are 0 for 26 https://t.co/GZ7BAJH4w0
If the Sox somehow win tonight then Eovaldi has to be the WS MVP favorite. Finishing last: Ian Kinsler.
If this game goes 18 innings, we should all agree to have Pedro and Koufax pitch the 19th.
“I’ll never believe that throw went where it did.  More absurd than Tyree’s helmet catch.” —@KevinHench just now
Just coming to grips with the fact that the Dodgers scored the tying 2-out run on a check swing walk, a pop-out that carried our 3B into the stands, and a routine grounder to 2B. Wait I’m not coming to grips with this yet.
@GlobeChadFinn TOO SOON
Don’t know why we pitched to Puig but Alex Cora is a White Walker this month so I’m not questioning him.
Ok
Mookie/Xander/JD/Benintendi went 0 for 15 tonight and somehow the Sox are 3 outs away from a W.
If the Sox win this game I want to take Alex Cora to the Morongo for 2 hours of late night craps.
Bizarro Ed Armbrister alert.
Really hoping we keep that number at 23. https://t.co/YsP4kkpfkc
By rule every World Series has to have a batshit crazy extra inning game.
Wow Cora is whipping it out for this game and going for the kill. I kinda like it.
I’m glad you all got to enjoy the Heath Hembree rollercoaster ride. If you feel sick just sit down and take a couple of minutes to catch your breath.
I would have walked Machado proving yet again that Alex Cora knows way more about baseball than me. Let’s go to the 11th!
This is true https://t.co/PcpEHyZfX1
I love how Buck and Smoltz are completely ignoring that Kinsler scores on that play if he bowls over the catcher or does even a half decent headfirst slide. That throw was 6 feet off.
Kinsler careened around the bases like an 18 month old in a bouncy castle. That was a legendary WTF performance. Unbelievable.
Kinsler definitely isn’t drunk but this is also what it would be like if he was drunk.
Extras and Pomeranz looming. Need runs. Need runs. Need runs.

I love Rondo and have spent the day trying to come up with a spitting defense for him.  I’m gonna need more time.
Cowboys had a 1st down on Wash’s 37 with one timeout and 52 secs left and somehow only pulled off 2 plays (a 6-yard completion over the middle and a 3-yard run) to set up a 47-yard FB, a 5 yard penalty and a game losing 52-yard FG.  Ladies and gentlemen... THE CLAPPER! https://t.co/MLdTJnVru3

Cleveland’s coaching staff is one for the ages.
Bortles benched - only London can save him now.
Oh man - that Sony leg twist looked bad. This sucks.
Lost in that fight was Ingram’s fantastic FU shove of a whining Harden before everything escalated. That was an A+ FU shove.

New BS Podcast...  0:00: Boston makes the World Series ... wait what?  23:00: @JonahHill on “Mid 90s,” movie soundtracks, the comedy police + his “class” of actors (good stuff).  95:00: My daughter’s “For Realsies” on A Star Is Born + To All the Boys   https://t.co/tiZIbFPn5K
I finally have blood in my body again let’s goooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!! WORLD SERIES! Way to go David Price that was huge.
https://t.co/osrLyziTE8
I wish I believed in anything as much as Cora believes in Kimbrel.
I never gave up on you David Price!!!!! https://t.co/BHn6s744R2
Did a “House of Carbs” pod with @HousefromDC in which we tried to answer 3 questions...  1. Who doesn’t love a good pasta bar? 2. Why aren’t there more pasta bars? 3. What would make up the perfect pasta bar?  Also: we talked about pasta bars.  https://t.co/5iC3pbqOrQ
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid - “You’ve never met a pair like Butch and the Kid.” Now I’m even more confused about my fate. https://t.co/cizCB9yffT
Still trying to figure out how the Red Sox are up 3-1 when...  1. Sale = 4 IP 2. Kimbrel = 8 baserunners in 3 IP
New 1-hour @ringer show: I picked my 21st century NBA Wine Bottle Team and chaos ensued.   ‘13 LeBron ‘03 Duncan ‘16 Curry  Who else made the starting 5? Can we risk ‘06 Kobe? Dirk or KG? Nash or CP? Is my 12th man really... (I’m not spoiling it)  https://t.co/CpiCWVxXEa
“Putting an offensive linemen on this list amounts to self-parody for me” — never change @robertmays   https://t.co/RiAUZBIcDY
Went on Dual Threat with @ryenarussillo to talk about the AFC, the running back Renaissance and why the Giants might have made the RIGHT pick with Saquon.  https://t.co/77Kufbprmg
Hey Columbus, Louisville and Bloomington — you can see the @oneshiningpod guys do a live podcast early next month, details here.  https://t.co/0vWOcUcQF1
3 biggest plays tonight...  1. A diving catch that finished off a 6-out save from a closer who allowed 6 baserunners and couldn’t throw 2 strikes in a row.  2. JBJ HR  3. Altuve’s 2-run HR that got reversed because of fan interference from an Astros fan wearing a Reagan-Bush hat.
https://t.co/iLWkFkj7lI
I think that’s the most clutch Red Sox catch of my lifetime. Used to be Brunansky in 1990 but considering the higher stakes and the Kimbrel Heart Attack Special in motion this one has to be #1
Never had a doubt @drbill1947 !!!!!!!!
“Where are the cigarettes?”  “What’s the best shot to help you relax - whiskey?”  “Didn’t we put an old pack of cigarettes in the attic 3 years ago in case of emergency?”  (Things you say in October when Craig Kimbrel is going for a 6-out save.)
That’s why Mookie is the MVP. Ridiculous outfielder on top of everything else. BTW... Kimbrel for six outs is a f’n head scratcher
If Kimbrel is going for 6 outs I’m just gonna send paramedics to @drbill1947 ‘s house right now to be safe.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I ALSO BELIEVE IN BARNES
Brasier barking at Sanchez to get back in the box was a transformative playoff moment for him - he’s been lights out ever since. I actually have confidence in him. Brazier!!!
J  B  J  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I VERY MUCH ENJOYED TONIGHT’S TELEVISION OFFERINGS
I’ve got this https://t.co/TLtOEE0O0V
Osweiler is rusty - he’s not in midseason pick-6 form yet, the guy got tackled on the 10.
You can only hold down Mitch Trubisky for so long.
How has Khalil Mack not strip-sacked Osweiler 19 times already?
@robertmays I’m all in on the Bears D singlehandedly beating any mediocre-to-bad team this season. Just steer the boat straight, Mitch.
My NFL picks from Thursday’s BS Podcast...  Cincy -1 Jags -3 Bears/Rams money parlay -108 (now up to -128)  https://t.co/8KJpSHjEsX
See they like each other!  https://t.co/leknyv6C0E
The Red Sox were really awful tonight. It feels like the score should be 28-2.
We have ALDS umpires who are so old that they can’t move out of the way of a throw that’s coming from 95 feet away.
Hey - @FanDuel has been sponsoring some of my BS Podcast episodes this season. New users get $20 off by going to https://t.co/jLxR2nCfCh ... I mention this b/c I’ve been nervously making DFS lineups as I watch this Sox game. It’s healthier than nervous-eating.
There’s only two playoff series left - how can we still have shitty home plate umpires? What the hell is going on?
I can’t wait until Angel Hernandez takes off his Hoye mask.

Angel Hernandez needs a new job.
The first base umpire keeps changing his definition of a checked swing, and Angel Hernandez changes his mind on a low strike every 80 seconds - this has been some shitshow of an officiating crew this week.

The Jimmy Butler Trade Request Hostage Crisis, Day 18 — the day we realized it’s probably more fun if he’s stuck in Minnesota all season.
I might be the only one not just in my family but in America who still believes in David Price. His last 12 regular season starts were lights out! COME ON DAVID PRICE YOU GOT THIS!!!! https://t.co/NApj2BefJ0
Yanks should have put this game away already. Sox hanging around... hanging around... 👀
Everyone is gonna shit on Price for the next few days, and that’s fine, but Judge/Stanton/Sanchez/Voit is a worst-case scenario for him - 4 righties with big power. Got rattled by 2 bombs. It happens. I still think he can be an asset this month.
It’s hard to believe that the Red Sox won 108 games and also started Nunez in their first 2 playoff games.

“First punt of the night for the Lions...”   This game isn’t running out of ways to hurt my feelings.
I can’t say I’m enjoying the Sony Michel era.
Might need to take a sedative or an edible before tonight’s BS Podcast recording w/ @thecousinsal
“Hey Josh, buddy, I need a favor - My Lions job is in trouble if I lose this game, can you run the worst plays possible?”
Just face-timed @drbill1947 and he answered with “WE SUCK!”
Keep searching for impact guys on either side of the ball and they are just hard to find on the 2018 Patriots ... where are they?
In coverage the Patriots linebackers look like they’re running in Balenciagas.
The 0-2 Lions settling for a FG at home on 4th and inches on an 11-play drive ... I love it!!!!
“Wait, instead of just taking Mahomes, we traded UP and took Trubisky?” —@robertmays’ grandkids in 2051

It’s Week 2. The Green Zone still sucks and makes no sense whatsoever. Just admit defeat, NBC.
Pat Shurmur doesn’t go for it on 4th and inches near midfield ... and then a half-hour later he goes for it on 4th and one near midfield. What’s been worse this season?
Worst Picks Ever came within a Lions garbage time TD of going 0-3 - MISSION SUCCESS THIS SHOW HAS BEEN GREENLIT FOR ANOTHER 8 WEEKS https://t.co/ORHbDuwjUR
Devin McCourty dogged it on the first part of that Westbrook TD. Such a sloppy performance by the Pats - take this game tape and burn it. Onto the Lions.
https://t.co/3mHEqm8a9k
None of the unproven big-game Pats (Waddle, Michel, Dorsett, Patterson, Rowe etc) came through today. At least so far. Def missed Edelman/Amendola today. TB has no security blanket on 3rd and longish if Gronk is doubled.
Sam Bradford: 11 for 20 for 64 yards and a pick. He’s 34-47-1 lifetime as a starter. Never won 8 games in a season. Turns 31 in November. Keeps starting NFL games. I just don’t get it.
A better offer than the second half of the Pats game. https://t.co/KxaJN2VxwA
I’d like to apologize to Arizona Cardinals for jumping the gun on this tweet. https://t.co/QLme7VCHRp
Incredible.  https://t.co/tg6lNwBqOq
Remember - every NFL defender is allowed to commit P.I. on Gronk at all times. It’s part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and everything.
When you’re in this seat some day, you’ll understand why I thought Zane Gonzalez could be a good kicker for us! But you’re not in this seat!!!!
Pat Mahomes is 19 years younger than Tom Brady - unless it turns out that he’s God, which would make him much older.
Best QBs ever...  1. Tom Brady 2. Joe Montana 3. Peyton Manning 4. Pat Mahomes 5. Aaron Rodgers
Seemed like Big Ben was a solid yard over the line when he threw that last TD. I’ve never been more consistently wrong about anything than the whole “Was that QB was over the line when he threw that?” question. I’m like 2 for 131 career.
I gambled on an Andy Reid team that burst out to a 21-0 lead, had the game-clinching TD called back on a penalty and now seems to be losing momentum... I mean, what could go wrong?
@oneshiningpod @tatefrazier @clubtrillion https://t.co/FFmsXBzv1R
“The first pick of the 2019 NFL Draft will be selected by the Buffalo Bills. The Bills are on the clock.”
Mahomes is like a cross between Young Brett Favre, Tecmo Bowl Randall Cunningham and Rifleman from Ampipe High.

The punter is Seattle’s best player - hopefully Pete Carroll won’t favor him and turn the locker room against him.
Cam was 40-1 for MVP before the year — Jimmy G was 16-1 https://t.co/0arcpTJrhC
All 243 remaining Chargers fans are furious at their shoddy receivers today - some killer drops. Interesting game so far. Chiefs are going to be in some high-scoring games.
Everyone made Peterman jokes for 3 hours (and with reason) but it’s not like Tyrod is good.
If the Browns tie, they need to dump Gatorade on Hue Jackson.
Only winner of this Browns/Steelers game is Baker Mayfield.
The Browns winning the turnover battle 5-0 and losing by 7 at home. We’re gonna be remembering the Hue Jackson era for the rest of our lives.
Welcome to the Red Zone Channel, Saquon!!!!! We’ve been waiting for you!
Jameis is a year away from being the face of the XFL.
Drops, penalties, dumb decisions and squandered opportunities - what Hard Knocks fan could have seen this day coming for the Browns?
It’s 3:13 ET and you’re officially allowed to panic about your Saints parlay/teaser/elimination pick.
Pittsburgh’s o-line’s euphoric over the top reactions to James Conner TDs are high comedy.
The announcers were just praising Hue Jackson / the Browns have 3 forced turnovers but 0 points. I missed football so much.
Wow - Bill O’Brien’s last 2 minutes in this Pats game were like a resignation letter.
Nice to have Andrew Luck back. He looks good.  Also nice to have Bill O’Brien’s clock management back.
Hue Jackson’s bold strategy of throwing away his offense to keep putting the ball in Roethlisberger’s hands is really starting to pay off.
Nobody is allowed to panic until 3 ET but swearing and throwing stuff is fine https://t.co/zk99vaZQIE
Every time they show Sean McDermott on the Bills sideline, it seems like he should be sadly chugging from a flask.
If Roethlisberger retires tomorrow, I think there’s still time for him to get a good TV job.
Tampa knows about everyone’s seemingly easy parlay or tease with the Saints and they’re gonna make us work for it. Buckle up.
Lemme know when you want me to overreact with my first “Roethlisberger looks washed” tweet of the season.
The first Bengal has been ejected - we’ve officially started the 2018 season.
Let’s all enjoy these last few minutes before we start to hate ourselves because of our crummy fantasy teams and poor gambling instincts. FOOTBALL!

I mean at least the Falcons are consistent.
Can NBC make it seem like the uprights are covered in burning orange flames? I can’t remember where they are on the field.
Still think facemasking penalties should be 5, 15, 25, 50 and 75 yards. Making Sproles’s head do a 360 is a 50 yarder right? If his head came off that’s 75 yards.
Just googled... “Is Matt Ryan hurt?” “What’s wrong with Matt Ryan?” “How old is Matt Ryan?” “Matt Ryan Tommy John Surgery”
It’s been 2 hours and we have 20 things to complain about already. The NFL is back!
Can NBC make the end zone pulsate with white colors? I’m a moron and I’m having trouble figuring out where the end zone is.
I genuinely hate NBC’s “darken the first down territory on the field” gimmick. Please no more. It’s ludicrous. How does this idea escape an ideas meeting?
I missed Atlanta’s red zone offense!
Football! Football! Football! Football! Football!

In 2001, thx to a trade, the Celts could've grabbed Denver's 1st rounder (no. 11) OR rolled it over to 2002 (top-3 protected), 2003 (top-1) or 2004 (unprotected).   They grabbed the pick and selected... Kedrick Brown.   Denver's next 2 years: 27-55, 17-63.  THIS STILL HURTS.

Having trouble figuring out which 5-6 NEW playoff teams we’ll have in 2018’s NFL season. It’s always 4-6 new ones (and one shocker). I can only get to 3.  2017 NE, Pitt, Jax, KC, Buff, Tenn Phi, Min, NO, LA, Atl, Car  Let’s say 5. Which 5 drop out and which 5 replace them?

Holy mackerel / they got Mack and a 2020 2nd back! NFC North teams should protest. https://t.co/wj0CoseNUd
Khalil Mack vs. Aaron Rodgers twice a year is my new favorite NFL rivalry.
Gruden explaining the trade to Mark Davis...  “We can save money, get a bunch of picks for Khalil and start over with some of my Gruden Grinders.”  “Sounds good. Hold on - hey Ma! The meatloaf! WE WANT IT NOW! The meatloaf!” https://t.co/Bo4Y3VuhyM
I would only trade whatever the Bears gave up for like 9 guys but Khalil Mack is one of the 9. You know who’s awesome? Khalil Mack.
Picked the right week on my podcast to launch the “Jon Gruden is gonna be a disaster for the Raiders” stuff.

Covered in my 3 BS Podcasts this week... —NFL nuggets —A Star is Born —Fixing divorce  —NFL over/unders —Gruden —Urban Meyer —LLWS —John McCain + Trump —Sox v Yanks —Parent Corner  https://t.co/SGZ7asOR1d  Here’s the new one with Mays/Dobbins/Laura Wasser: https://t.co/JRRYnVNu2M
It’s amazing how many NBA teams panic and make all their roster moves in July/August. Like Atlanta — they had OKC over a barrel w/ Melo, nobody else could have absorbed that money. Why not wait, you only get more leverage as season starts and OKC is freaking about their tax bill.
I APOLOGIZE FOR LEAVING OUT ORLANDO - MY BAD
The lesson for GMs, as always: any time you’re in a pinch, just keep calling Sacramento, Phoenix, Charlotte or Atlanta and it will work out.
Houston did it again - Anderson’s contract was untradeable and they somehow flipped it into Knight’s contract which is absolutely tradeable. Now they can trade Knight + a 1st + $$$ and get an expensive wing who’s actually decent-to-good. Bazemore at worst. GSW should be pissed.

Our @POTUS is intentionally putting American media members in actual DANGER to deflect attention from his own wrongdoings.  He has power and sway, he knows it, and he’s using that influence recklessly to threaten the free press.   This is a real thing that’s happening in 2018.

My big idea for the Oscars in that Big Picture pod - make every film decide whether they’re submitting for “Best Picture” or “Most Popular Movie.” Can’t be in both categories.

Second FFB poll...auction or snake draft?
Doing a podcast with @MatthewBerryTMR right now... are you pro-PPR for your fantasy FB drafts or anti-PPR? I’m anti, Berry is pro.
I plowed through this. Mid-80s Me had a massive massive crush on KT. You can make a case that...  1. Body Heat created the modern erotic thriller 2. KT was the most entertaining actress of the 1980s. 3. No actress in the past 50 years had a cooler/more distinctive voice. https://t.co/5TtEMm7PET

I’ve seen every Red Sox center fielder since Fred Lynn and JBJ is the best defensive CF of all of them.
Fixed a couple of songs that were accidentally thrown in there... also “Baby Come Back” by Player should be on there but it’s not on Spotify.
My 4 rules for a Yacht Rock playlist...  1. Song has to feel like it could be played on a yacht  2. No soft 70s rock allowed (Bread, Air Supply, etc)  3. Every 3 to 3.5 songs needs to include Michael McDonald in some way  4. Anything after 1984 is prob too late

I actually think Melo is a good one year trade risk for a fringe contender like Portland because his game SHOULD age well. What happened to him last season doesn’t totally make sense. Might have just been wrong team/wrong fit in OKC. Not impossible.
It’s odd that Wade + Melo became crazy-expensive untradeable liabilities in back to back summers. Makes sense in 1988, 1998 or even 2008 but not in 2018 when so many stars have extended their primes. Melo - no major injuries, not a ton of playoff games, only 34. No real excuses. https://t.co/3F2KEBg5Tq
I would have enjoyed Equalizer 2 regardless, but Denzel playing a revenge-seeking Lyft driver in Boston really pushed it over the top for me.

“Next week on the Bachelorette, it’s the most dramatic episode yet as Becca and Blake get trapped in an unusually long TSA security line.”
It’s a bad sign when Chris Harrison is the most dynamic part of the season.
This season of The Bachelorette is a historic snooze. I’m starting to think Arie made the right call.

Last night in Vegas, @davidchang talked me and @TheCousinSal into betting the “don’t come” in craps for a solid hour. He brought us to the dark side. It was 3am. I have a lot of regrets.

I still think LeBron is going to LA - but if the Sixers can create a Simmons/Embiid/Kawhi/LeBron scenario for him, how does he not seriously consider that?
The terrifying version of this obviously...  If they can figure out how to get Kawhi AND LeBron.
So @sam_amick is reporting that the Spurs will only trade Kawhi to the East. Philly has to be heavy favs - cap space to absorb Kawhi/Patty Mills plus 3 of Fultz/Saric/Covington/ZSmith plus that killer 2021 Miami pick plus Bayless expiring.  https://t.co/uAakatyUF1

Think top-12 goes like this... Phx - Ayton Sac - Bagley Atl - Doncic  Mem - JJJ Dal - Porter (then they max Boogie on 7/1) Clips - Bamba (trade 12/13/PBev to Orl for 6/Mack) Chi - Carter Cle - Sexton NYK - Knox Phi - Mikal B Cha - SGA Orl - Young

Doncic dropping to 3 for no real reason reminds me of the 2005 Draft when Chris Paul was clearly the best guy in the draft and somehow went 4th.  https://t.co/ljgEI4uBkU
The @Ringer Draft-Day Mock Draft goes Ayton/Bagley/Doncic as the top-3... so basically the best player will go third. Makes sense.  https://t.co/mwuaQhmaWz

New @JJRedick Podcast with the greatest athlete in Greenwich Country Day history, @spidadmitchell — fascinating stuff in here about Mitchell being shocked/disappointed when Charlotte didn’t take him.   https://t.co/gphZM0dkEq
It’s the 20th anniversary of one of the last drafts that had this many dumbass front offices in the top-10 was 1998 - that was the one when Dirk and Pierce fell to 9 and 10. (And BTW the Pitino Celts were dumbasses too - even they knew they had to take Pierce.)
BS Podcast w/ @SheaSerrano @HousefromDC  —A stupendous ‘Creed 2’ trailer —Dragooooooo! —Kawhi v S.A. —10 years of ‘Taken’ —Do Celts make a Kawhi run? —So long DC Sports Curse —Are we sure Ayton goes first?  —Dwight Howard’s ultra-goofy Hall of Fame career  https://t.co/SGZ7at6spN
Trae Young falling all the way to the Clippers at 12 would be absolutely ludicrous - but with this many dumbass teams in the top-11 it can’t be ruled out. https://t.co/deincGbFmt
@KevinOConnorNBA @ringer Not saying this would be enough - just saying that’s what they could cobble together (and also take Plumlee’s contract back).
@KevinOConnorNBA @ringer Celts could pull off Rozier, Morris, Yabusele, the 27th pick and the Kings/Grizzlies future picks for 3 and Plumlee’s deal (12.5m next 2 years).
On today’s BS Podcast, @housefromdc and i broke down Dwight Howard’s goofy Hall of Fame career after yet another move (his 6th team!).  Transcript: https://t.co/ktNfM10xHS  Podcast: https://t.co/SGZ7at6spN
1 other topic discussed with House — are we SURE Phoenix is taking Ayton 1st? It’s 24 hours before the draft and nobody knows. Doncic was +1500 to go first when we taped the pod. I wouldn’t be shocked if Phx took him.
United totally would have let this go. And i think people would have expected it on Southwest.  https://t.co/sYVq50xvyH

https://t.co/kilkc81uUS
Fake trade... —Dallas gets 2nd pick + Chandler Parsons (2 yrs, 46m) + Temple (8m expiring) and takes Doncic. —Sacramento gets 4 + Harrison Barnes + protected 2021 1st from Dallas and takes Bagley. —Memphis gets 5 + Z-Bo (2 yrs, 24m) and takes Porter or Bamba.

I love seeing this US Open course kick everyone’s collective ass. This is so much fun. Have you ever identified more with professional golfers? Watching this reminds me of why I quit golf when I was 24.
This is one of the weirdest moments in recent golf history - I was on the phone when this happened and almost dropped the phone https://t.co/ampMc4MHlt

Friday’s BS Podcast: @kyrieirving on Kawhi rumors, leaving LeBron, Boston’s future, his fav 2K lineup, player empowerment, Tatum and Stevens, KD, his health, Uncle Drew and more.   Plus: @SeanFennessey on Hereditary and the horror movie pantheon.  https://t.co/s1XDt4ufGk
New BS Report: @KyrieIrving on leaving LeBron, Kawhi rumors, summer moves, The Empowered Player Generation, Boston’s Future, millennials, Stevens v. Coach K and much more.   PLUS: talked “Hereditary” w/ @SeanFennessey (last 15 mins) - a horror classic?  https://t.co/SAizFRdq8D
If they gave up 2 and took on Gasol’s contract, Spurs would say yes in 3 seconds. Spurs would get Doncic and cap space. It’s a Hail Mary for the Kings - but again, they’re the Kings! They do stuff like this! https://t.co/a2BUKSiFvp
Sac wants to shop 2 for a star b/c they’re losing 2019 lottery pick to Boston (unless it’s top-1) — if they flip 2 + expirings for a 1-year flyer on Kawhi, he knocks 2019’s pick out of top 10 and they’d be able to dangle 5-year max.  NOT SAYING THIS IS LOGICAL - IT’S THE KINGS!
I have a terrible feeling that the Lakers are gonna end up with LeBron, Kawhi and Dame next season.
Kawhi’s pre-agency is already heating up. https://t.co/1jU9DiBHZ1
Kawhi‘s pre-agency has officially begun. https://t.co/5UhMZsc6pd
Fake trade...  —Clips get 2nd pick, 2 years of Parsons + an expiring. —Kings drop to 4th, get Beverley, shed 2.5m —Grizzlies get 12/13, Harris and 2 expirings. https://t.co/l9vuBhAfYw
Fine - he’s slumping the last week. On June 5th he was slugging .566 and six for six on SBs in 89 plate appearances at Omaha. The Royals are breaking his spirit!
Why won’t the @Royals bring up Adalberto Mondesi? He’s crushing it in AAA and being blocked by 30 year old Ryan Goins and Alcides Escobar who are hitting .224 and .216 and freefalling in June. The Royals are 22-46. What the hell? Why don’t they care about my AL Keeper League?

61 for Durant and Curry tonight.  54 for LeBron and Green last night.  You need your superstars in a Game 7.
That was meant to be a Brooks/Donovan tweet!
That’s a great win.  Coming back from 12+ on the road to win a Round 3 Game 7 is a legitimate achievement and we just saw teams do it on back to back nights.  (Granted, we also saw the home teams miss 259 combined threes. But still.)
I can’t believe GSW might win a Game 7 with KD’s old clogged toilet bowl offense from OKC.

LeBron was awesome.   And yet - winnable game for the Celts. Cleveland’s offensive rebounding and all the missed FT’s really killed Boston. Too many second chance points. Oh well. Game 7!!!!!!!!!
Remember that Tatum 3 just there / usually takes one shot to get him going. This is an unusually unsafe double digit lead with no Love and LeBron on pace for 48 by the way.
Here come the touch fouls...
I’d love to see my face 25 years ago if someone told me the league’s best player was going to play all 48 minutes in a must-win playoff game during his 15th season with 53,000 NBA minutes on his odometer already.
Any time Jeff Green scores more than 5 points in a half against your playoff team it feels like getting your credit cards stolen.
Two shots in 18+ minutes for Tatum. 😡
I’m weirdly confident.
New BS Podcast: Are the Cavs alive and kicking? Are the Warriors dead? Why does that Quinn Cook shot explain everything? I talk it out w/ @ChrisRyan77 ... plus - how the Rockets win Game 6 without CP, and a long interview with Johnny Knoxville.  https://t.co/ggRtKMP3lU
Agree with this + there’s no way they could let Hanley get enough ABs for the 22m option to kick in, so unhappy Hanley losing ABs isn’t worth the risk. This team is too talented. Will be interesting to see if they can deal him. BTW - @redsoxstats is a great follow for Sox fans. https://t.co/d3wEZPBBvJ

If I could change one pick it would be Gobert over Horford. That crazy winning stretch Utah had ended up swaying me and I overrated it. Horford played way more games and meant just as much. Oh well.
Can’t believe DeRozan made 2nd  team over Oladipo (better 2-way player, meant more to his team, slightly better stats). Just weird.  Simmons over PG for 3rd team was a no brainer for me. BS was fantastic last 2 months.  I couldn’t vote for Curry - he missed 40% of the season.
KD vs Giannis for 2nd forward spot was unfair. Didnt love how KD ended reg. season but he’s a top-3 guy and I didn’t think he should lose that spot unless Giannis took it. The Bucks just weren’t good enough and G tailed off a little late.
https://t.co/eJKSuSLP6Q
My All-NBA ballot was...  1ST James, LeBron  Durant, Kevin  Davis, Anthony Harden, James Lillard, Damian   2ND Antetokounmpo, Giannis Towns, Karl-Anthony Embiid, Joel Oladipo, Victor Westbrook, Russell  3RD Aldridge, LaMarcus Simmons, Ben Gobert, Rudy DeRozan, DeMar Paul, Chris

I didn’t assign this piece https://t.co/dRiLw21Wz1
That game never regained its flow after the Nance/Morris incident - was like watching one of those rock fights from the Ben Wallace era.
This game will never be on ESPN Classic.
The fans are now pleading for Tatum to shoot like we are trying to save a child trapped in a well.
Roof was gonna come off for That Tatum 3... in and out... Cavs keep hanging around...
Rozier hit the Unexpected Playoff Hero Wall. Get up Terry!
LeBron’s footwork on those 5-sequence spinning downhill drives is incredible. It’s almost like he invented a new way to post up.
The only Celtic that worries the Cavs in halfcourt is Tatum - they are happy when anyone else is shooting. Celts need to iso him at top. LET THE CHEF BAKE!!!
I didn’t realize Larry Nance Jr and Jordan Clarkson were still on the Cavs.
Go to the hoop Jayson. Go to the hoop Jayson. Go to the hoop Jayson. Go to the hoop Jason.
Here’s the BS Podcast I just did w/ @jjredick about what he learned from battling LeBron and the Celtics, Philly’s Future, the 2018 shot that haunts him, Boston fans, Chris Paul’s chase for a ring, Duke’s shift to one and done, and the iso revolution.  https://t.co/2bcTy6cw2I
LeBron’s over/unders for Game 5 per Vegas. —34.5 points —53.5 points/rebounds/assists  (Jesus)
Good luck with the Caps @HousefromDC @KwakaFlocka - I’m never gonna tell anyone what House did to try to clinch this Game 7

Just recorded a podcast with @jjredick about the NBA Playoffs and some other stuff ... should be up by 1 ET. It’s a good one. His pod comes back on @ringer next week.  https://t.co/gphZM0dkEq
Tonight’s key Celts: Smart, Horford   Tonight’s key questions: —Will the Celts continue to treat LeBron like its an honor + a privilege to play him, or will they start fighting/scrapping/clawing like he’s in their way?  —Will Tatum ever realize that JR Smith can’t guard him?
I’m in Boston and the sun is shining and the entire city is preparing to battle LeBron.  Possible chants for tonight’s game...  “You’re a ba-by” “Please stop cry-ing” “You’re not M-J” “You will leave. You will leave.”  (Crap - you’re right, he’s a machine, none of this will work)
Just watched 4Q again. Ariza and Tucker were phenomenal. I can’t remember GSW taking that many bad shots in a 4Q since 2016 Game 7 Finals. Houston’s D was great. That’s a tough team.
Cannot understand why CP3 made the free throw...
Cannot understand why KD gave up the ball...
THIS IS A CLASSIC
Rockets are scrapping, clawing, retaliating and talking shit — this is exactly what the Celts didn’t do last night, they were way too deferential to LeBron especially (with the exception of Smart).
Here comes James Harden!!!!
This is a tragic month for Chris Paul’s max extension.
I told @haralabob pregame that I wanted the Rockets to unleash Eric Gordon tonight and that he was their secret sauce... Of course I also told him that the Rockets would cover +8.
When did the Lineup of Death officially become the Hampton 5? Was there a vote? I didn’t get to vote.
This strategy is also used in my son’s 10-and-under League. https://t.co/2RYu76QHza via @ringer
I went with 70-80%
Curious what you think... how healthy is Chris Paul right now? I will put my guess below. I thnk it’s the biggest reason this Rockets Line is so high (+8???) in a must win game 4 without Iggy.
Here’s the pod with @ZachLowe_NBA - i spent most of the time torturing him with unanswerable summer questions like “Will McCollum be on the Blazers next year - yes or no?”  https://t.co/76vEsMvhnK

Tatum refusing to just take JR off the dribble and score every time is damaging my internal organs.
This is the dumbest basketball Boston has played for these entire playoffs. Guess they were due for one of these but man.
Cannot figure out why Smart came out. They had it going defensively when he was out there.
Been waiting for Smart on LeBron. At least make him work a little.
LeBron: 34 of 36 mins, 35 pts, 21 FGA, 14 FTA ... and it’s a physical game.
Ty Lue did a good job in these 2 games. Smart adjustments. Not entirely sure how the Celts are only down 10. Nobody is playing well.
The Cavs aren’t playing “better defense” - they’re grabbing and clutching everyone off the ball on every play. It’s really smart. Watch what they do to Tatum and Brown off the ball. It’s throwing them both off.
I’m not even gonna say it.

Re-watched 2nd half of Cavs-Celts. Jeff Green + JR Smith were like Bizarro Robert Horry and Bizarro Manu Ginobili. So awful. I can’t imagine LeBron’s reaction when he watched the tape.
I didn’t realize this until recently, but Fast 2 Furious is now a comedy.
The Orioles are horrendous. This is like Manny Machado and the Bad News Bears.

Celts missing easy shots and making dumb plays... letting LeBron hang around....
Halftime reading https://t.co/zaRaug40Px
Wouldn’t mind seeing Scary Terry show up for the second half.
Tatum has done this all season - goes thru mini funks, makes one shot and suddenly he’s totally fine.
LeBron is on pace for 100 points and the Cavs are only up 5.
Celts are playing the wrong pace - this is too slow, they need to push the ball and make Cleveland run. Also / Morris killing the Celts.
Luka and Booker is the League Pass backcourt we need.

My hero https://t.co/XkOSZvMORW
Tyronn Lue threw the damn towel for Game 1 - Game 2 in 51 hours.
Tatum can get any shot he wants against this Cavs team - I’d bet that once Boston got the big lead Stevens decided to save that particular wrinkle for Game 2.
Until they call him for stepping over the line on a free throw shot (which he does every time) https://t.co/87POBZnxDp
And just like that... they washed the stink off.
That was the first stretch of boneheaded basketball in a long time for the Celtics. Got too comfy with the big lead.
Celts need to go back to attacking the basket - Cleveland has no rim protection. Tatum needs to take over a little. Key couple mins here. LeBron is definitely lurking.
That was the first time Jaylen has looked like Jaylen since the Bucks series. He was at like 60-70% for most of that Sixers series.
Can somebody at this game scream “GO TO THE BASKET JAYSON!!!!!” for me?
This is the ideal shot chart for the 1st quarter (and this whole series) if you’re the Celtics. https://t.co/dBcnH32BAb

Jayson Tatum played 29 games and 966 minutes at Duke last year as a freshman.  He’s played 92 games and 2,861 minutes with the Celtics (and still going) as a rookie.  Last 7 playoff games: 22.9 PPG, 51-31-84%, 7.3 FTA, 37.3 MPG.
I feel bad that LeBron James doesn’t have any help in the 2018 Playoffs.  Oh wait, here are the active 2018 payrolls for our 2 Eastern Conference Finalists (not counting Hayward, Irving, Larkin and Theis, all of whom are out).  Cavs: $135.7 million Celts: $65.2 million.

Celts were down 22 in Game 2  Down 5 late in OT in Game 3.  Down 4 with 90 secs left in Game 5.  I’m still kind of in shock. Hard to remember a more lovable Celtics team. Jayson Tatum needs a fake ID to get into bars and he’s a go-to Guy on a Conference Finalist. What???
here's our live postgame Ringer NBA Show from tonight... https://t.co/jcaNiCZGRO
Amazing - only six years ago! https://t.co/1HYcwWzxIa
That won’t be our last Sixers-Celtics playoff series with those guys. Kudos to Embiid - was so much fun/scary to root against that guy tonight.
My fav moment of that game was Smart yelling at Stevens to keep him on Saric at the end right before that key turnover. “I GOT THIS!” He was screaming. Then after - “I TOLD YOU!” I fucking love that guy.
No threes no threes no threes
Can’t believe that JJ 3 didn’t go in... that was a potential dagger.
Average Al being average.
Tense tense tense tense. Gotta say, the Sixers seem super confident on their bench.
This is gonna be a fascinating fourth quarter. Crowd got taken out of it. Boston desperately needs Tatum to get going - he can get any shot he wants. Philly has to play Embiid with shooters if Bos is doubling right?
Embiid has been awesome tonight.  Very loud 21 points. But will he get tired in the fourth???
Only @GlobeBobRyan is gonna get this reference but Anderson is like Mike Riordan in Game 4 of the ‘74 Finals - he’s just here to start a fight with Smart.
Brett Brown down to 2 timeouts - i think he thinks you can buy more of them or something.
What a way to end the half. It was LOUD in here. BBrown helped with all those subs - 76ers could never stay in a flow, he was changing lines like it was hockey.
Morris and Covington deadlocked in a “who can murder their team more tonight?” duel.
(I like this move - Smart is such an immediate energy boost off the bench especially at home, I hate when it starts.) https://t.co/RqESlUpa0F
Concerned about Game 5. Without Larkin the Celts only have 4 guys (Smart, Rozier, Tatum and not-healthy Jaylen) chasing around Philly’s shooters. Very little lineup flexibility and BBrown knows to go smaller now. Crowd needs to be an ‘86 Walton level 6th man tonight.
Shout out to everyone in the 916. #neverforget
I’m Team Chuck in all feuds with Shaq - but he’s wrong about the 00-02 Lakers. Shaq carried those 3 teams, his 3 Finals were legit ridiculous, and his 1999-2000 season was an all-timer. Shaq wins those 3 titles with any All-NBA sidekick plus Dick Bavetta. He was dominant.

I still haven't read the right feature about the difficulties in tracking podcast traffic and how it's like the Wild Wild West even now in 2018 with all the money that's flowing in... even Apple's podcast rankings are flawed and pretty easy to exploit if you want to cheat.
There still isn't a foolproof way to measure podcast traffic. The closest is probably Apple's episode charts, which measures total downloads within 24 hours of a new episode posting, but even then - Apple usually generates 60-70% of someone's podcast traffic and that's it.
To get tracked by Podtrac, you have to sign up with them, then redirect your RSS feed to them so they can track the traffic. We didn't do this for a variety of reasons. Neither does any podcast that uses @midrollmedia for ad sales.
In this podcast boom piece, the writer relies on Podtrac for download info/rankings/conclusions but never mentions that The @Ringer + many other pods do NOT allow Podtrac to track their data. Only pods that sign up with Podtrac get "ranked" by them.   https://t.co/q8mIg8CjpY

Google me Chuck!
There’s an unexpected music video in here that’s delightful. Also - Rodger Sherman is on probation. https://t.co/1i2lr1vS2m
Chapman looks fantastic and like he’s definitely gonna stay healthy all season.
Judge up, bases loaded, Joe Kelly coming in, tie game... fans booing like crazy.... THE RIVALRY IS BACK
I can’t wait to retweet this in 2 months after he gives up 11 runs to the Orioles. https://t.co/Ql0cZhvs5b
Wow - Mookie has been absolutely unfathomable this season. We’ve seen some great 6-week Red Sox stretches but this is way up there.
It’s good to have a legit Yankees/Red Sox rivalry again - the quality/intensity/star power/bitterness feels like it’s officially back. I missed this.
No. https://t.co/5waCfXSgfk
My old Grantland teammate @Steven_Hyden released a new book about the end (?) of classic rock called ‘Twilight of the Gods’ - you can order it on Amazon here.  https://t.co/GnpYi8Vdj1

The Sports Emmys are one of the longest and most insufferable nights of the year. Its like the 7th circle of hell but with a cocktail bar. Good luck to the nominees!
I have a new podcast coming within the next 30 mins - try to keep yourself together in the mean time.
Brady looked like John Travolta filming a magician movie - yet another 2018 loss for the Pats. I love 2018 as a Celts and Red Sox fan and hate it as a Pats fan.  https://t.co/7Sbuc2uNJX via @ringer
Here’s @bryancurtis on Black Planet, probably the weirdest NBA book ever written.   https://t.co/TcAgKjEkX9 via @ringer
