And good luck to @AquaBlueSport! Loved watching Denifl take the huge win on 17. Hope to see US Champ @larrywarbasse back winning again soon!
It's been a great @lavuelta to watch. Can't wait for the Angliru tomorrow - that is one climb I don't feel the need to EVER do again!
@leadmoto Still pretty smokey and several fires in the area.
Congrats to @gmeaster and @Illuminatebike for the great win at Vuelta a Colombia! https://t.co/c1EqlXBFDF

Heading into the 2nd rest day, have to say this has been a crazy and great @letour to watch. Can't wait for the 3rd week!
Can't help but think Landa would be wearing yellow right now if his team hadn't been chasing him... All of Spain must be pissed right now!
@rickroof And the directors!
@georgenbennett Big boy ride!
But massive props to Uran for winning on a single speed! And congrats to @georgenbennett for a stellar ride!
Steps 2 and 3 of the plan are even more critical when leader is also a three time champ... 😳
Basic bike racing tips: 1) Isolate leader. 2) DON'T work with isolated leader. 3) Attack isolated leader to get time. Hmmmmm... 🤔

@DrewBledsoe All right, it's on! But only if it's a non-contact ride. I don't want to have to explain to my wife how I got tackled on my bike! ;)
Sad to hear the news of Michele Scarponi's death. Great rider who always had a smile. Thoughts are with his friends and family. RIP.

Right decision was made at @LeTour.  @chrisfroome is a legend. 🚴🏻🏃🚴🏻 Best attack of the day goes to @AndreGreipel.

Happy Thanksgiving!
@JamieLindsay happy Thanksgiving!
@JamieLindsay we are putting off Thanksgiving until Saturday.
And that was two teeth split in half - not four teeth. :)
Going super light for 2016 - wisdom teeth gone! But it snowed a foot, so it's a good day to stay inside and recover! https://t.co/OMuQUc5hzj
@ryantrebon OFF SEASON. OFF SEASON. OFF SEASON. And... SNOW!!!! ;)
Having a great off season with the family - riding bikes, motos, and hiking. And now the snow is here - @mtbachelor opens next week!
Wyatt loved his first off season hike in his @Thule chariot. And of course Bruce the Moose had to come too. :) https://t.co/Feu5rKOQjW
Congrats to @metierseattle on their grand opening today. Very cool shop, cafe, training center and more. Enjoyed a sneak peak last weekend!

Great weekend of racing at @reading120 and @BucksCoClassic with @D3devo. Beautiful courses - thanks to everyone who made it possible!
I am betting that this will be one of the most entertaining Gran Fondo's this fall... Gotta love @thejensie! http://t.co/wOIyVvRvyC
And finally - thank you to our Airgas Safeway @D3devo staff, sponsors and fans. Thank you so much for your support, cheers and motivation!
Thank you @Connor511 - my roommate and constant shadow on the bike this week. Always there to keep me protected and out of trouble.
Thank you @geraMedina for riding until your legs fell off. Climbing hard and working selflessly for the team.
Thank you @LuisE_Lemus - the MexiCAN climbing machine. From covering long breaks to pacing me on the final climb today - always racing hard!
Thank you to the fantastic Easter brothers - @gmeaster and @BUILD_AROUND_IT - amazing guys and incredible workers all week long.
Thank you @mauchjustin for the huge miles on the front and still being there in the critical times during the race to help.
Thank you @Kevin_Gottlieb for riding the front day after day, always willing to put in the work and keep me out of the wind.
It was an honor to race @tourofutah again this year with these guys by my side! @D3devo
Today was a day of suffering for me but my Airgas Safeway team saved the day. Every guy rode his heart out and kept me going to the finish.
And thanks to all my teammates on Airgas Safeway @D3devo for the great support!
Congrats @JoeDombro on a great ride! Missed the train when it left the station but worked my way back up to the front group. On to tomorrow!
So proud to see the Airgas Safeway boys on the front ALLLLLLLLL DAY today. Shout out to @Kevin_Gottlieb and @mauchjustin for amazing work!
Incredible to see how strong the Airgas Safeway guys are here in Utah! Working hard in the race and still taking great care of me all day.
Another great day with Airgas Safeway @D3devo at @TourofUtah. And thanks to all the fans who voted for me as the fan favorite for today!
Team Airgas Safeway @d3devo boys did a great job today riding the front to keep the break close and taking care of me. Cold and wet day!
Can't wait to start @TourofUtah tomorrow with Team Airgas Safeway @D3devo. Going to be a great week of racing!
@patrick1975bike :) Hope you're doing good!
We wouldn't have made it through @tourdaz without @patrickredford. He came to watch but spent the week as support staff extraordinaire!
And for an inside look at @D3devo, check out @patrickredford's account of @tourdaz for @VICESports. Part one (of 5): http://t.co/KrAqEEBIlG
Great to watch the @D3devo guys racing hard in @TDQL_Official! Lost @MattRawdy to a tough crash but still battling. Good luck guys!
@akakirk529 Yep!
Thanks @tourofutah for the race invite for @D3devo. Can't wait to battle it out in August with Airgas Safeway!

@radzinschi @lavuelta @PhillyBikeRace @D3devo Thanks!
@theprez6371 @D3devo @AirgasUSA No problem! Thanks for the ride.
@pshanec Thanks!
@snyderceramics Thanks again! Great to meet you.
Great ride by @Kevin_Gottlieb today - lapping the field and finishing 12th. Looking forward to another fast day tomorrow with @D3devo boys!
Nice ride from Philly to Reading today - enjoyed being back in the big rolling hills! @reading120 course tomorrow. http://t.co/FRpmG7fdTj
Love being back at Philly. Perfect race for @d3devo until final lap mechanical but great to see team ride so well. We'll get the next one!
Happy Memorial Day. Means a lot to be racing for the stars and stripes jersey on a day that honors the soldiers who gave their lives for it.
Congrats @MatthewBusche on a great ride and well deserved win. And thanks to the @D3devo boys for all the hard work out on the road!
Hey @BillyDemong - I told you we might get DQed for this... Guess we dodged a bullet!
Don't worry, no wheels were exchanged in the making of this photo... ;) @BillyDemong @richie_porte @giroditalia http://t.co/dr24oY6LlW
GC shouldn't be decided by this kind of rule. Flat tire alone in critical moment is penalty enough! @richie_porte @giroditalia
. @richie_porte is getting penalized 2 min?? If this rule is always enforced, lot of guys will be in trouble for getting help from a friend!
"@D3devo: Big thanks to @VICE for letting us kidnap @patrickredford this week for @tourdaz!" Thanks for all the help!
And then there's this kid. Buy him toys and what's his favorite thing to play with?!?! A blanket.... ;) http://t.co/7HiIorcEuH
Congrats @D3devo on great racing at Sea Otter! @LuisE_Lemus takes the win and @MattRawdy in third yesterday and 2 in the top 5 in the crit.
Love being back at @redlandsClassic this week. Legs aren't quite 100% yet but feels great to be back!
@ilovejojos My favorite is the @thule T2. Easy to use and doesn't mess up the frame paint.
. @SWalesRdracer @Thule Urban Glide Stroller is great! Haven't tried any of the bike trailers yet but have heard the Chariots are fantastic.
"@D3devo: @redlandsClassic (4/8-12), @SeaOtterClassic (4/16-19), Joe Martin (4/23-26), Gila (4/29-5/3), @tourdaz (5/6-10)" Looks good!
You know that time you accidentally end up in the Costco checkout line with someone else's cart? Yeah, me neither..... ;) #tired

Excited to be heading back to @letour with @lampre_merida. Going to be a great month of racing!
Back in Italy after fun racing in Slovenia. Great to be back! And congrats to @lampre_merida and @RuiCostaCyclist on an epic win at Swiss!
Congrats @SachaModolo and @lampre_merida on the great win yesterday at Swiss!

Good training day in Italy and now relaxing on the couch watching Game 4 of the NBA Playoffs on my @Slingbox. #nospoilers
"@lampre_merida: Welcome back to the races @hornerakg ! 😉 👍 👌 👏 http://t.co/OqkcOQ9Rb0…" Thanks! See you soon!
@tpeter100 Congrats Ben! Best of luck for the future.
@cyclingreporter Thanks for the great interview!
One of those days. Put my undershirt on backwards and spent 5 min looking for a lost arm warmer just to realize that I'm already wearing it.
Life in Italy. Old @giroditalia stages in the morning before training and live @giroditalia stages on after training! http://t.co/LarJe1i90t
Thoughts are with everyone in Southern California right now. Hoping for cooler temps and more rain to help with the fire fighting.
Congrats to @DiegoUlissi and @lampre_merida for a great win today at the @giroditalia! Great way to start my morning!
Huge congrats to Svein Tuft - one of the hardest working and nicest guys in the sport - and the new leader of the Giro!
@toreyphilipp Are you taking orders? I'll take six! ;)
@RuiCostaCyclist Sorry to hear about the crash yesterday. Hope you're healing up. Good luck at Romandie! @lampre_merida
@RuiCostaCyclist Thanks Rui! Great job at the spring races! Can't wait to see you and the rest of @lampre_merida again soon. :)
And a HUGE thanks to @lampre_merida, the Lecco hospital doctors and nurses, and everyone in the area who helped me out after the crash!
Happy to have my shoes on for the first time in a week and be walking out of the hospital! Thanks for all of the support.
Good luck to the @lampre_merida guys at MSR. I'm heading over to Spain today for @VoltaCatalunya. Lots of racing going on!
Got to take the good with the bad sometimes!
But! I have been 2nd and 6th on GC. Wore the leaders jersey for many days. And top ten in stages more time then I can remember.
Leaving T/A with a sore Achilles. First time here in 1998 four more times after that, and I have never left in one piece.
Sounds like it was a tough finish at PN. Congrats to @RuiCostaCyclist and @lampre_merida on 2nd overall, and hope Rui heals up quick!
Great ride by @BenKing89 out there today!
Off to bed to rest up after a long day on the bike. Thanks to my fantastic @lampre_merida teammates for taking great care of me out there!
Add another Coke to the tally. Pre-bed Coke = sweet dreams, right???
Fine print: "Do not attempt at home. 20 year professional on a closed course. Blah, blah, blah......" ;) http://t.co/vMh7ctwV31
Long day on the bike today. Lost count on the number of Snickers and Cokes I had but I'm guessing it was a LOT! :)
Made it to Italy! Grazie @Bartolimichi e ragazzi per un buon allenamento dopo il mio volo.
@followadam Thanks for asking but I'll be back in Europe for @TirrenAdriatico. Enjoy San Diego!
Congrats to @DiegoUlissi and @lampre_merida for a great win today at GP Camaiore!
@ryantrebon Absolutely! Saves me an inch worth of spacers! ;)
Bike is dialed, San Diego weather is perfect, and legs are good - time to head out for a big ride. Only one week until @TirrenAdriatico!
And just put on my @YourFSA K-Wings. Now I've got wings! ;) In extra wide, of course, since that's the way I roll... http://t.co/8WzlNcqIUd
Have my new @lampre_merida training bike all dialed in. Tested out my new delivery from @FulcrumNA &amp; they are FAST! http://t.co/b5V0hfcDzR

Great to hear about @georgenbennett's new contract - congrats!
And yes, my wife made me put that up... :)
Babies and puppies - ridiculously cute! http://t.co/CPMbMg8EVc
@gccycler :) Same with my 11 year old! But might have something to do with the fact that their bikes are twice as heavy as ours. Poor guys!
Spent the weekend at the Oregon State Water Polo Champ with Horner Kid #1. 2nd place &amp; dinner at A&amp;W, can't beat it! http://t.co/4vyH0FeWse

Hanging out and enjoying the last of the great fall weather in Bend today. Looking forward to the snow though!
@gregorhutton Thanks Gregor!
Thanks to the staff, riders, and sponsors at @RSLT for a great four years. I'll be going somewhere else for 2014.
Congrats @yokoteute on a legendary career!
Now back to the "to do" list. Yesterday was painting the shed. Today, painting 2nd coat and taking Horner Kid #1 to a water polo match.
Spent last year contributing to a book that is now available - a "How To" racing guide with stories from my career. http://t.co/6FQW2uRM9R
Ribs are finally healing up - which means it's time to start the off-season "to do list" from my wife... This could get ugly!
Still feeling a little beat up from worlds but hoping to get out on the bike for a little bit with everyone. Take it easy on me though!
Heading down to Sacramento today for the @clarkscornerca Cycling Challenge. Dinner tonight and ride tomorrow benefitting @PowerOfBicycles.
@tomasvaitkus Hahaha! Thanks to my fantastic co-driver! ;)
Yes it was worth it and yes the dream continues... With or without the belief. #ididthat!
The jersey returned only this time for life, the stories to tell before &amp; during it are epic &amp; life time. #ididthat
100% is given and second time it happens, only to pass just as fast but belief is returning. #ididthat!
A life time of work and a stage/jersey arrive and disappear over night. #ididthat!
So much stress &amp; work 4another start at a dream that began many years ago. #ididthat!
Works paid off, forms back, but by now some have lost belief. #ididthat!
Amazing help and belief from all my family, friends, and fans to get back there. #ididthat!
Whole season disappearing fast but still working hard to make it to those grand tours. #ididthat!
Moving up the ladder w/that continued belief, big sponsors on board now. #ididthat!
Finding that belief, given the leadership, delivering on it. #ididthat!
Up @6am w/3kids so I can drop them off @school before I go train all day for the Grand tours. #ididthat!
Start going up the ladder with each year passing while never getting that leader respect and belief. #ididthat!
Sell everything I own for a second chance at a grand tour, fly over with a 140bucks in my pocket. #ididthat!
Winning again but told I'm to old to go back to Europe a second time but keep fighting anyways. #ididthat!
Take a step back hoping to go forward again. #ididthat!
Oops. Only a Walkman for company. #ididthat!
Live in Europe in a small apartment W/no car,computer,phone,TV, only a walk for company. #ididthat!
Win everything in the US, pass on the big pay check, go to Europe for minimum pay. #ididthat!
@fishjonathan thanks !
Race pro for years w/out pay just hoping to make enough winnings to pay rent. I did that!
Pro teams won't give you chance, so you buy your own license and race as an independent. I did that!
Sleeping in hotels,host family houses,cars,and park benches to get to the races. I did that!
Hitching a ride across the country for months w/no money (almost I had 400+-) to race.  I did that!
Riding your bike to work so that you can train for hours in the dark after works done. I did that!
15 years old and up @ 4:30am before school starts to train while dreaming of winning a grand tour. I did that!
So sorry to hear about the death of @AmyDombroski. RIP.
Happy to be back home in Bend with the family. Beat up and sore but should be healed up and ready to go again soon!
“@lavuelta: We wish @hornerakg a speedy recovery. "Vamos" champion! http://t.co/zfGNKro25u” Thanks! I'll be back racing for the win in 2014!
@jreesnc Exactly! I'm a bike racer, not a computer genius! :)
Test results show up on Safari but not on some other browsers - will try to fix it so it shows on all browsers.

@danmcdonogh Will do - thanks!
@hoffdude yup, that's the time I was there. I spent some serious time in that gym my first year.
@danmcdonogh Nope.
@therickyross when the races are coming yes. During the winter no
@PHayes760 all of them. And always passing by on 52.
Makes me think rest days are harder than training days. Unless it's a Grand Tour rest day - easy ride, eat &amp; sleep. Now THAT'S a rest day!
Rest day at home - 1 hr bike ride, wash the bike, clean the garage, UCI quarterly blood test, errands, organize training gear and stretch!
@tomasvaitkus See you soon! Looks like we have plenty of sunshine so everything should be good. :)
Having a good recovery day in SoCal. Waiting out the rainstorms so I can get back to the mtns &amp; start training for @theTourofUtah &amp; Vuelta!
@hoffdude Which school did you go to?
@stlseven Naw just got taller. ;)
@celtstrong Yup!
Now - heading out for today's ride... http://t.co/iztOlXzmUE
Then (25 years ago or so)... http://t.co/A8oGukxhnw
Happy 4th of July!
@RKilun No - from Mercury in 2000.
@RKilun that's a custom paint job from Joe Bell!
@noelwalling Yup!
Heard a very cool story this week about a 12 year old riding from San Diego to BC for climate change. Good luck Zeke! http://t.co/pHwN81Jvua
Congrats to @Jan_Bakelants and @RSLT for the great win and yellow jersey today! Way to go boys!
First day back on the bike yesterday and it was a hot one in San Diego! Great to be riding again! http://t.co/g9noT88WMM
@Monty717 Me Too! that's was a good win! With or without hair.
@phillipojones just two on top and a BMX bike on back. The rest of the bikes we have already at the SD house.
@kkratt Three are mine. Youngest is a loaner. :) Mine are 15, 13 and 11.
@Rumpledhasher @thejensie Nope - Jens definitely wins! Three are mine and one is a loaner... :)
Won't make it to France but getting to spend time with the family. Hoping to be back on the bike next week! http://t.co/1eZ1zoMSfe
@cjwilkins02 Me neither - my wife sets it up for me!

Congrats to my friend and San Diego training partner @Seanmazich for a great win at Nature Valley Grand Prix tonight!
Yes! Congrats to @gregory_rast and @RSLT! Great win today at Swiss!
Watching Tour of Swiss. Great to see @gregory_rast in the break. Go Rasty!!!
Go @thejensie!!!!
Sad to be missing the Tour but looking forward. Lots of great races left this year! And, it's National Donut Day, so how bad can life be?
Great ride by @MatthewBusche and @RSLT today at Dauphine!
@MatthewBusche With time, the pain will ease... Trust me, I know! :)
@juddcummings Will do - thanks!
No @AmgenTourofCali for me this year. Bummed to be missing it but focused on getting back to 100% for the summer races.
“@LukePickering97: @hornerakg my dad is inspired by your riding and he rides for a cycling club in yorkshire,england" Tell your dad hi!
Consensus seems to be a metal detector. No idea if/how it works - just thought it looked cool when i was a kid and always kept it.
And no, it's not a car to bike radio from my 1st year as a pro... But they did look pretty similar... So who is SURE they know what it is?
Back in San Diego - washing bikes and tinkering in the garage. Found old electronics in a box. Any idea what it is? http://t.co/3F1BiB7dYC
@leeapplbaum Yes!
Heading back down to So Cal to get some good training in!
And congrats to @RSLT and Robert Kišerlovski for a fantastic 3rd place finish in the Romandie prologue. Great guy and teammate!
Arrival #2 was my new custom @gaernecycling cycling shoes. Very cool looking and can't wait to try them out! http://t.co/APIfDxojPQ
Feels like Christmas with lots of cool gear arriving! First was @CEPCOMPRESSION Clone tights from @furge92025. Great for travel &amp; recovery!
“@_JJColl: @hornerakg can I get a RT for my pal Conor Kelly who is a massive fan looking to pass his apprenticeship this week” good luck!
@rickroof Not soon enough! Still waiting for things to heal up...
@danieltjny Nope but I was grocery shopping at Costco in Bend!

“@vanderjeugd: Good response, Loren! #sagangate  http://t.co/u9Ej8cafox” Hahahahaha...
No pro could have made it to the top without the help of local races and promoters - supporting those races as a Pro is paying it back.
I believe UCI riders should be able to race at the local/national level. Would love to see this rule changed! http://t.co/hy6b4IJrj7
@tomjanci Yes they did! They made this years race epic!
@tomjanci Absolutely!
@tomjanci Because that fan just mysteriously appeared out of nowhere... Or not.
Had to avoid the Internet so I could watch Paris Roubaix on the DVR. Amazing ride by @f_cancellara and @RSLT. Congrats boys!
@JamieLindsay Congrats Jamie!
Back on the bike - on the trainer in the garage but at least it's a start! Staying motivated by watching the @RSLT boys attacking in Basque.
Great ride by @f_cancellara and @RSLT! Congrats guys!
Congrats to @f_cancellara and the @RSLT boys on a great win at E3!
Had to pull out of Catalunya with an injury today. Tweaked something on the steep climbs in Tirreno and need a little time to heal up.

@turningpedals Very true...
@edeansd No imposter - that was me!
@rickroof It's my bike of choice! Easy on the back.
@dominguez1k2go Thanks Papa!
Putting the Domane to work on Black Canyon yesterday. http://t.co/bmYBZQfbUc
You know it's a good training day when lunch time is 5:30 pm...
@kdawg892 Never been to that donut shop - always go to the one next to Von's. Love that place!
@kdawg892 So the three donuts during my ride was a bad idea?!?!? Oops...
@Scurvy1968 Good dirt but weather can be a little tricky sometimes. Usually a good time to be there though.
@MahieuWim Nope - no classics for me. Back home after Basque to get ready for California.
Six hour ride today. Previewed the Palomar Mountain section from Stage 1 of this year's @AmgenTourofCali - snow at the top!
Schedule looks like Tirreno, Catalunya, Pais Vasco and then back for @AmgenTourofCali in May. Looking forward to getting the season started!
Heading out for another big day in San Diego before the rain hits tomorrow. Season is coming up quick! First race will be Tirreno Adriatico.
@curtisjwhite Good luck Curtis! We'll be cheering for you!
“@BenKing89: Can you guess who was my roommate at training camp? http://t.co/hZ34J8UW” Hmmm... Looks familiar... ;)
@leeapplbaum @BenKing89 tell me about it! I had to get by with McDonald's.
@leighaski @fatcyclist @meganjhorner Congrats!

Two more days at home before heading over to Maryland for the @savealimbfund ride and dinner this weekend. Hope to see everyone there!
@jcrboricua Both but mountain for the trails because I'm too old for that many bumps!
@hakanbergman Not yet, but it can't be too far behind! Mountain bike for now, skis and snow shoes will be next...
Rain has finally made it to Bend. Can't wait to get out on the mountain bike!
Off season cross training = building kids' furniture!

Great weekend in Ione for the @clarkscornerca Challenge. Thanks to everyone for coming out! Now a few days at home before @dempchallenge.

@mtnace Nope! Hanging out and riding in Oregon these days.
@gwbright Haven't heard of the grasshopper series. Waiting for the racing calendar to be set before we do the fondo date - early/mid august.
@lancearmstrong Keep a shirt on, man... You're making the 20-somethings feel bad!
All of the rides support great causes so hope everyone can make it out to say hi! @savealimbfund @dempchallenge @clarkscornerca
Spending the fall in Bend but traveling for a few great rides @clarkscornerca on Sat, @dempchallenge on 10/14, and @savealimbfund on 10/20.
Racing season is done which means I'm back to my REAL job - chauffeur for my kids! Great to be home and hanging with the family.

@GarageWW Thanks Erik!
@DavidThorberson Definitely tricky. Good luck with the surgery!
@Ange23 @HannahRooMcDade @TrekBikes Looks great - have fun!
Will be a good week! Also my TdF stage jersey auction ends today - benefits two little girls who lost their dad to ALS. http://t.co/guBRjzff
Back home and on full Dad duty. Week off the bike means house projects, back to school shopping, and helping #3 practice on the crutches.
And 2 days left to bid on my 2012 TdF jersey from Stage 5 @TheProsCloset http://t.co/guBRjzff - proceeds to go Jess Swiggers' family.
@acnpiratewench Ha ha ha. Thanks!
Last day of Colorado - then I'm headed home for vacation! Looking forward to a little time off the bike with the family.
Great crowd for the finish into Colorado Springs today. Glad it stayed mostly dry though! Big day into Boulder tomorrow...
“@TheProsCloset: Bid on the jersey straight off Horner’s back from Stage 5 of '12 Tour! http://t.co/guBRjzff” Auctioning for a great cause!
So congrats on a great win @RSNT and @thejensie. Class act all the way - couldn’t ask for a better guy by your side, day in and day out!
Great day for @RSNT. Classic epic riding by @thejensie to take a HUGE win! He went at km 0 so all I contributed were my “GO JENS!” vibes.
Horner recap from yesterday: Horner kid #1 did her first bike race &amp; Horner kid #3 got his first broken leg. Lots of calls home last night!
Long day yesterday - was happy to see the finish line! Still not a fan of 8,000+ altitude - that stuff hurts!

@MarkOertel Thanks!
Final day of preparations for my http://t.co/pg9JnVIP going on, plus a good training ride. Full day. Looking forward to it all starting!
Heading out for my first post-Olympics ride. Might feel a few twinges after my trip into the barriers/crowd, but otherwise feeling good!
Back home in Bend! Always nice to wake up in my own bed after a few months away. And looking forward to sun and good temps too!
@GarageWW So sorry to hear that! But thanks for donating it - we will make sure to pass it on to someone who needs it.
Now looking forward to heading home to Bend tomorrow! Time with the family as well as hanging out with everyone at my Cascade Gran Fondo.
Crowds yesterday and today were unbelievable - a little too enthusiastic at times, but still great to see and hear!
Had fun riding with the USA boys! And made it over to The Mall just in time to watch the finish of the women's race - looked like a hard day
Enjoying a day in London. Yesterday was rough - good legs but no luck. Crash, mechanical, and chaos. But great ride by the team!
Things I’ve learned so far in London… 1) Never follow a first time (amateur) Olympian around.

Survived two hard days in the mountains. Took a detour to a ditch yesterday, but made it out w/ cuts and bruises. Hard way to start the day!
Thoughts are with @sunnysidegaryb - hope you're feeling better and back on your bike soon Gary! #cancersucks

Crazy day at the Tour with the tacks on the road - added a lot of stress and extra work near the end. 5 total flats for @RSNT in a few km!

Legs are feeling recovered from yesterday's cramps but now very tired from covering attacks and trying to bridge on the climbs.
Hard day out there - everyone is looking a little wrecked! Tried to get across to the break, but the field didn't seem to like that idea.
Just posted today's @SRMtraining - hard day out there for everyone! http://t.co/hGMDLer7 Walking a little slow after that one...
@nealrogers @velonews Yup, no mechanical - full leg cramps so had to stop before I fell over! Pounded calories and bottles and recovered.
Able to help the team at the end - good for team GC. Four in the top fifteen and still a long way to go to Paris!
Very hard day with serious racing! Average of 282 watts for the first 3 hours. Full cramps with 30 km to go, but recovered for the final.
Happy to help with @cofiresale @Michael_Creed - hope it helps those who need it.

Stage 2 done at the Tour. An "easy" 130 mile day but another super fast finish. Knee is doing well - must be Dirk's Snickers and Coke cure!

Stoked to be headed to the Tour with @RSNT! Another 100 mile training day today - one more week of training and then it's back to work!
Back from training just in time to watch the NBA finals. Bam!
@thejensie Thanks Jens!
And Happy Father's Day - thanks to my kids for making me great cards! Always love getting those.
Congrats to @schleckfrank and the @RSNT boys for a great ride at Swiss! Looking forward to watching the stage coverage after training today.
I'll definitely be back for my Gran Fondo! RT @BrianFalotico: Congrats on Olympics! Does this mean you won't be at the Cascade Gran Fondo?
Enjoying a bike racer weekend - big training rides, massage and rest.
Sorry about killing the average age of the team, guys... ;)
So excited to hear the news on the Olympic team - honored to be selected with such a great squad! Four T's and me!

@mono_fitz that's cool! Thanks!
Sorry had to fix the tweets - my phone was trying to help me spell and apparently it doesn't know @thejensie... :)
I think @thejensie is legendary and an unbelievable teammate!
Hey twitter! NBC Sports got the wrong Jens yesterday. @thejensie would never do that. Cuz he's Jens MotherF'N Voigt! Off &amp; on the bike!
All the best to @andy_schleck - hoping for fast healing so you're back with the @RSNT fast!
And thanks for all of the tweets!
Another good 100 mile training day - and the last ten on the TT bike. Looking for no repeats of Bakersfield in the future!
@mm_racing @meaux_marie absolutely!
Just finished a 600 mile week. Legs are tired but should be coming around just in time! Weather is good for two more big weeks of training.
Good training day in San Diego. Saw lots of weekend warriors out on the roads - and some very familiar jerseys from the past few years!
@johnhatchitt Absolutely! Have those at the last rest stop at my Fondo. Wouldn't be a Horner ride without it!
Oops - make that NBC sports...
Finished a good training day and now relaxing while watching the Dauphine on Versus - great way to spend the afternoon.
Back in San Diego after a great trip to Nashville for @HarpethRR. Big four weeks of training ahead!
Congrats to @jakob_fuglsang, @schleckfrank and @RSNT for a great ride at Lux!

@philieman @rsnt The crashes in the first and second stage. #RSNT4ToC
@Nategt4 @NissanNews Yes, when I won the Basque Country a few years back #RSNT4ToC
@gregpagano @NissanNews It's always breakfast: eggs, bacon, toast if I'm training. Racing, it's that plus oatmeal &amp; rice #RSNT4ToC
@RSNT It's always great having lots of fans, they always seem to give you that little extra motivation #RSNT4ToC
@Kel7s @NissanNews @RSNT @TrekBikes Only adjustments really are lighter wheels #RSNT4ToC
@HelpMotherEarth It starts really young, as young as 18-19. Biggest thing is results and ability, with a little bit of luck #RSNT4ToC
@jshclifton @lancearmstrong There's a lot of important things to learn from @lancearmstrong. Mainly, how to deal with the media. #RSNT4ToC
@deankilton @hornerakg @rsnt I always like to be independent and be ready to take care of myself if needed. Like carrying my visa. #rsnt4toc
@Sleehrat1017 @hornerakg As long as it is warm and sunny, Switzerland is a fantastic place to ride. #rsnt4toc
@techknowgn @nissannews  yes it has been fantastic riding with all of the guys. Always excited to be with the schlecks and canc. #rsnt4toc
@flyhombre @TrekBikes @NissanNews Certainly in the sprints, he is. Let's hope Baldy is a little bit much for him. #RSNT4ToC

@NissanNews Great question, yes, but I like it #RSNT4ToC
@Kel7s @NissanNews @RSNT Baldy of course, it's the steepest and hardest and I like a challenge. #RSNT4ToC
@RSNT Yes, everything about this year is more challenging than last year. #RSNT4ToC
@cyclerBeat 3 strips of bacon every morning, sometimes 4! #RSNT4ToC
@hemmel YES. And you better win. #RSNT4ToC
@Sleehrat1017 @NissanNews 2006 Tour de France, about 4 days before the alpe d' huez #RSNT4ToC
@NissanNews it varies all the time, roughly 3 days a week of 5-6 hours. 2 days a week of 3-4 hours, and 2 days at 1-2 hours. #RSNT4ToC
@melissagerman @NissanNews Great questions, it's got to be In n Out burgers and ice cream.
@melissagerman @NissanNews @millarmind It's going to happen one of these days. But the story isn't finished yet.
@mholtwick @TrekBikes @RSNT @NissanNews 7 days a week before the big objectives, usually do about 500-600 miles a week
@GeekDad248 @TrekBikes @RSNT @NissanNews I'm 138 lbs, I definitely prefer the uphill segment. And the flats when the @RSNT boys are around
Glad to be joining @NissanNews &amp; @RSNT tonight to chat about #ATOC, thanks for having me! #RSNT4ToC
Have a question for me about #ATOC? Send them to @NissanNews and include #RSNT4ToC. You can win some @RSNT prizes! http://t.co/CpzW5Fpb

I’ll be talking about my experience so far on #ATOC at 8PM CST today following Stage 3 of the tour. Follow along at @NissanNews #RSNT4ToC
Survived the first 2 stages. Close calls in the run-in both days, but happy to be in 1 piece! @rsnt is a little battered but fighting hard!
Heading out for my last big training ride before @amgentourofcali. This week is all about the final tweaks and bringing it all together.
I need some extra training - anyone need some lawn work done?? RT @jd_senator: while you're at it, get the lawn done? http://t.co/yM5dZBqd
Tour of California is right around the corner. Can't wait!
@Art037 Check out Craft USA's website - http://t.co/kMlY0vmb
Just finished a good 100 mile ride. Finally got to ride in sunshine again after some cold and wet weeks in Europe!
Did you Horner-size it? RT @lancearmstrong: Thanks for supporting @bobikesbama. First time I've eaten a burger in the middle of a ride.
Long travel day from Belgium but happy to be home in Oregon - looking forward to a good week of recovery and family time!
Up early to head to Amstel Gold Race. Always a great race to be part of!
@jd_senator Of course! ;)

For an early look at the California roster, check out Johan's latest blog: http://t.co/SVv2wZps Looking forward to it already!
Final stage was fun. Course and rain made it very entertaining! Survived the week despite a few bad days - now looking to the next races.
Today's last stage time trail in Pais Vasco has something for everyone. Steep up hill, crazy down hill, and fast open roads.
Three more days to go - Team @RSNT  is going to keep fighting - we really like funny hats!
Big stage today at Pais Vasco. Went for it on the final climb. Wasn't ideal to make the first attack but needed to shake things up!
Two days done at Pais Vasco. Happy to stay off the ground today! Hard day coming tomorrow, so should be interesting.
Thanks guys! RT @hilitebikes: happy hilitebikes could help @hornerakg packing his bike for upcoming trip to #PAÍSVASCO #procycling #goodluck
Congrats to @janibrajkovic for a fantastic win in Catalunya! Sounds like it was an epic day out there.
Congrats Timmy! RT @timmydugganJGH: At least I get a new jersey to wear tomorrow http://t.co/nShZ43nd
@csprenkel Home now is Bend but can't beat SD for winter training!
@PyreneesWorship Getting better every day - thanks!
Great to see lots of registrations for my Cascade Gran Fondo - see you all in Bend, Oregon, in August! http://t.co/pg9NVvRZ
Recovery is going well. Can't wait to get back to racing soon. Good luck to @RSNT boys in Catalunya!
No Catalunya for me. Taking care of a little injury and getting ready for Pais Vasco. http://t.co/hJWOXXoI
Also great to see @RSNT ranked 1st on the world standings again. Great job guys!
Epic race at M-S-R - congrats to @f_cancellara and the rest of @rsnt for a fantastic job. That was an impressive 2nd place!
Congrats to @PowerOfBicycles - World Bicycle Relief is celebrating its 100,000th bicycle in the field. Great news! http://t.co/xr2Woqcn
@amosvranna Great! See you in August!
And... Registration is open! Had a blast last year - can't wait to do it again! http://t.co/ehGIWAW6
But, more importantly, registration for my Cascade Gran Fondo opens in 5 minutes! Hope everyone can make it! http://t.co/pg9NVvRZ
Had a crazy long travel yesterday - now need a rest day just to recover! Racing is easy compared to travel...
@JohanBruyneel @KellyFeilke @jmschaffer Thanks guys!
Also exciting to see the Tour of Cali announcement. Looks great! http://t.co/rnt1pJmm Bummed that @janibrajkovic won't be there though.
Thanks for all of the support over the past few months and especially this week - loved hearing all of the cheers and reading the tweets.
But the season is just getting started, so... Look out because I'm back! Going to be a fun year with @rsnt !
And congrats to @f_cancellara for taking an impressive win today and @Benna80 taking 2nd - they worked all week and still crushed it today!
End of a great week at Tirreno! Thanks to all the staff and teammates on @rsnt for giving me an amazing comeback week/start to the season!
Another tough stage down at Tirreno. @RSNT boys were fantastic all day and we kept the jersey for another day. All comes down to tomorrow!
Managed to hit the beach and the slopes today - all in a day's work!
@mcewenrobbie Thanks Robbie!
@zeeuwseleeuw Great ride today!
Another long and hard day of racing at Tirreno. @RSNT boys were fantastic - took great care of me and we kept the jersey for another day!

@Markelirizar @RSNT Thanks Markel!
@lancearmstrong Thanks Lance!
Thanks for all of the tweets! And if you're wondering, that climb is HARD...
Great day for @rsnt in Italy - guys were fantastic and got me to the finish in a great spot. Looking forward to the next few days!
After a long 8 months... It's great to be back!!!
@leeapplbaum You will be missed. Thanks for all of the support and help - can't wait to see what you do next! @radioshack
Great first day back at the races. @RSNT Team was fantastic - I just had to hold on for dear life! Looking forward to a fun week of racing!
Made it over to Italy. Great to be at the races again!
@DavidBombeke Thanks! Great to see you today!
@LongLiveMonty Wednesday! Tirreno-Adriatico.
Go @f_cancellara go!!! Up early watching Strada Bianche before the group ride. Great race.
My Cascade Gran Fondo will now be held from August 3-5, 2012. More info at http://t.co/pg9NVvRZ - registration opens March 15.
Sorry for the change! But working hard to give everyone three routes to choose from. Should be a great time - event is now Aug. 3-5, 2012.
Working on my Cascade Gran Fondo arrangements - sorry to have to change the ride date to August 5th. Couldn't get road access on the 4th.
Two more days of training and then it's off to Europe again for Tirreno-Adriatico. Excited to get back to it!
Hate hearing that Pais Vasco is having financial trouble - hoping they find a sponsor soon. An absolutely amazing race! http://t.co/odraGFZz
@leeapplbaum I would have thought that having 24 miles to go meant that it was the perfect time to get a double-double. Fuel to the finish!
@jasonbebright2 135 miles.
Another big ride today in San Diego - caught the Swami's ride with a visit to Wohlford, Ramona, and Alpine. Good day to ride!
Just downloaded it! RT @RSNT: The free RADIOSHACK NISSAN TREK mobile apps are here for iPhone & Android.  Get it now!  http://t.co/BngBLQQS

Happy birthday! RT @ChristopherT35: @hornerakg Can I get a RT for my birthday. Huge fan and cant wait to see you at #ATOC
Two weeks from tomorrow I'm back to racing. Going to be riding the @f_cancellara TGV! Could be one hell of a first day back in Tirreno!
@Mega_Mindy No classics - heading back to get ready for Tour of Cali instead.
Heading out for another big ride today. Glad the weather is looking better but I wouldn't mind if the 80 degree days wanted to come back!
To be clear: Versus=NBC Sports but Universal Sports=Universal Sports. To watch me all year call 1-800-55-GET-US and say you want US!
Universal Sports needs u 2 call 1-800-55-GET-US and tell ur TV provider u want Cycling & Olympic sports coverage. Call now & spread the word

73 and sunny today! Up early to get a good ride in before Superbowl time. Four weeks until my first race of the year - Tirreno Adriatico.
Heading out for another big day of training - getting in some good miles. Season is coming up fast!
@menotyousharp @PowerOfBicycles Absolutely! ;)
Just renewed my racing license for 2012 - default setting was for a "master's" license - wonder if they're trying to tell me something?
@janibrajkovic Remind me never to fly with you - I think you have the worst travel luck ever!
Another great ride in San Diego. Went out for the coast ride and it was a fast one! Now for a little recovery time on the couch...
Bike ride, prizes, and supporting @PowerOfBicycles - what more could you ask for? http://t.co/Iz3v5xbE - Prize #1: a private ride with me!
@janibrajkovic Congrats!!!!
Another great day in San Diego. Heading out for a short ride and quick visit to @SpeedplayPedals - love having them just around the corner!
@leeapplbaum That might be more than the world is ready for!
Break time at @RSNT camp in Mallorca.  http://t.co/Q4aJ3iIL
Good 5 hour ride today - 6 laps on a loop with hard rollers and wind. Legs are coming around! @RSNT
We took a pic together and he sent me a copy he autographed for me. Still have it at home.
Just saw the US team for CX worlds - looks like a tough team. And congrats to Curtis White - met him at Gloucester cross in '06. Great kid!
Another good day at @RSNT camp. Two hours on the bike easy and lots of movies while recovering on the bed!
Another good day at @RSNT camp. Had to stay up long enough to get updates from cross nats. Great racing out there! Off to bed now.
Happy New Year!
Congrats to @ryantrebon for a great win today! Must have been all of the good cyclocross advice I gave him while training last week...
4:15 ride time today, followed up by a great massage and some acupuncture by @Bourque13  . FEELING GOOD NOW!
The Navy Seals arrive at the Holiday Bowl in San Diego.  http://t.co/hlnCwjBH
@leeapplbaum @KellyFeilke Family politics! Father-in-law graduated from Cal. Taking one for the team.
Don't tell @lancearmstrong but I'm sitting on the Cal side!
Halftime at the Cal/Texas Holiday Bowl game.
Good ride in San Diego today with @ryantrebon. 3 hours in perfect weather - 75 and sunny.
Merry Christmas! Hope everyone has a great day with family and friends.
@JamieLindsay Good luck and heal up! Look forward to seeing you back in Bend.
@leeapplbaum More importantly - I can give Siri the head's up on who is going to win the 2012 Tour of Cali!
@JamieLindsay Bad pay but you get to hang out with the Horner's! And in sunny San Diego... How's the knee?
@mach598 It's part of our charm!
Merry Christmas Eve! All ready for the big day - just need to find someone to wrap it all for me - that part never goes well!
Spending the evening @RadioShack getting a new family phone plan. Can't wait to try out the new iphone 4s and escape @tmobile !
SoCal has been good to me this holiday, but the dually is having a hard time fitting in... #tinyparkinglots  http://t.co/0IpWhfJy
Heading out to train - supposed to be 70 and sunny today. Love it! Perfect Christmas weather if you're a bike racer.
Thinking back on 2011. Riding with @RSNT , winning the Tour of Cali and getting married! #WhatAYear indeed! Now on to 2012! @RadioShack
Hitting up @RadioShack tonight to activate some new iphones 4s's - going to be an early Christmas at our house!
Ok @sacca - time to come clean. What did you do to the power grid in SF?
Donate to WBR for gifts for fam & friends. Change someone's life thru the @powerofbicycles - my bro-in-law is getting one, but don't tell!!
Happy holidays! Doing some Christmas shopping later today. Last stop will be the perfect place for a few family members http://t.co/aAkWz81J
@ERIKAjaneC Does that make me as cool as you or you as cool as me???
@Michael_Feicco Happy birthday!
Happy birthday @janibrajkovic  - have a good one!
Saw the Bro Vet guys on my ride today in Santa Clarita. They were aiming for 180 miles in santa ana winds - ouch! http://t.co/PyX7iSua
@BenKing89 Wow! You win the crazy travel story of the day award on that one. Glad it all worked out.
@EGCurtin Nope, can't do Elk Grove since they are UCI - not allowed to under the rules.
I'll have more announcements for the 2012 Cascade Gran Fondo coming soon. Working hard behind the scenes to get it ready! @ridethecascades
@GarageWW @JamieLindsay Glad to hear it - but only if Jamie promises to wear his yellow pants again!
Happy to be back in Bend today. And for anyone who's interested in coming for a visit, my Cascade Gran Fondo dates are set - Aug. 2-4, 2012!
@Laurentmartorel Nope - no Oz for me. Starting the season a little later in Europe.
@DasBorch That is a record. I got overwhelmed and had to sit and rest. I think time stops when you walk in the door.
Made it back to the US and almost home. Long trip, but sounds like mine is going better than @MatthewBusche and @jmschaffer !
@janibrajkovic I'm with you on IKEA. We went once, and I bonked before we made it to the exit. Never going to get me in there again!
Newly remodeled Alicante airport - Starbucks AND Subway! Now I know where to come when I&#39;m training in Spain and need a US fix!
Up bright and early to head back home. Great camp but looking forward to getting back to the family.
@sacca Hey now, be nice to my @Chargers - they need some love!
And hope everyone is enjoying Bend for the USGP cyclocross races this weekend - bummed to be missing out on some great cross spectating!
Gotta love the @RadioShack perks on RadioShack-Nissan-Trek! Now its off to bed - last day of camp tomorrow before it's back to Bend again.
Another great day in Spain. Good ride with the full team and some time hanging out with @leeapplbaum who brought sweet @RadioShack presents!
@maevesloane exactly! Just sitting down to breakfast with my non-festive version.
For the record, @BenKing89 didn't know who Robert Wagner is... #oldguyjokes
@zachgullickson Yup - Astana is down here training too - caught their buses in the photo.
@bikeguy916 - 2012 Goals - win bike races, help RadioShack-Nissan-Trek teammates win bike races, world domination (but just in cycling)...
I'm rooming with Robert Wagner this week at RNT camp, but I can't get him to admit anything about Natalie. @RobertWagner83
So, I swear I didn't just crash twitpic with my last post, though it kind of seems like it... Sorry if the link isn't working at the moment!
After a post-ride nap (for three hours!), I headed out for a walk and found this on the beach... http://t.co/utPoVANc
Great first day of training camp in Calpe. Fantastic weather, and a good ride with the team. http://t.co/ySYC6tMx
@vladmaior Calpe area.
Made it to Spain! Settled in at the team hotel, and now it's time for bed. Should be interesting to get camp going tomorrow!
@JamieLindsay That doesn't look like any fun either!
Just saw the pic of @Markelirizar post crash - ouch! Always tough to see. Heal up fast Markel!
@meclimbin No racing because of bleeding risk on blood thinners (6 months) - back to racing as soon as I'm off them.
@SprintWithJess Not sure yet - still trying to figure out what will work best with travel.
Back at the airport, headed to RadioShack-Nissan-Trek team camp in Spain. Time to get the show on the road!
Celebrate @powerofbicycles w/ amazing night presented by @COMultisport featuring @taylorphinney @mirindacarfare & more http://t.co/7uGwG426

@leeapplbaum Absolutely! The boys at @RadioShack take great care of me.
Next trip to @radioshack already planned - time to switch from @tmobile - four months straight of screwed up bills. Time for an iphone 4s!
@JamieLindsay I ate a piece for you! Happy Thanksgiving Jaime!
@msanderfive Turkey Trot was down in the Old Mill - 5 km and 10 km run/walk.
@leeapplbaum - no running for me! We did the 5 km WALK... I learned my "Chris should not run" lesson a few years ago - the hard way!
Happy Thanksgiving! The Horner family is up early to head out to Bend's Turkey Trot this morning. Working up an appetite for our big dinner!
@jmschaffer Thanks guys! You and me both! And thanks again for the GTR - had some serious fun in that thing today...
Huge honor to win an @TeamRadioShack fan award. Thanks to everyone for the support over the years. Can't wait for 2012! http://t.co/YPJliFjK

@Rideforlife First camp is in Spain in December.
@JMcyclin_gingr Nothing yet...  Maybe in December?
@MattLarson70 Great. Should be a fun weekend!
@MattLarson70 Looks like early August, but should have the date finalized this month.
Don't worry, I waited until I was on the way home before stopping at In-n-Out for lunch! RT: @JamieLindsay "@hornerakg for diet advice???"
@JamieLindsay Still can't believe they let me anywhere near impressionable young racers...
Had a great time riding with the next generation of great US racers in San Diego today. Thanks for letting me tag along!
Now - it's back home for a little more off-season before the first Team RadioShack-Nissan-Trek riding camp in December.
First camp was to bring all the guys from 2012 Team RadioShack-Nissan-Trek together for a little team bonding and planning for next season.
Just wrapped up our first team camp for the new @TeamRadioShack. Good to catch up w/ everyone & meet the new guys. Going to be a great 2012!
On my way to Austin for a great @livestrong weekend. @lancearmstrong @BenKing89 @mellowjohnnys - see you soon!
Disappointed to come back from my training ride and hear that the Cali Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the 3-foot passing bill for cyclists.

@EthanSuplee My second suitcase is usually FULL of all my favorite processed American food products when I head over!
@EthanSuplee Have a good trip! If you want to be entertained, try asking for ice in your drink at dinner...  #wheninfrance
@coltpeterson45 Yup, that was me!
@EthanSuplee Don't worry, I guarantee you will be able find as many baguettes as you can eat soon! #Wheninfrance

Oldest guy in the race sitting first on GC !
Keep the caddles burning! 2nd on the morning stage today. The TT is tonight.
All you master racers.  Burn a candle for me, maybe two just in case.
Was looking at the start list at Tour de L'Ain. There is a kid here born in 1990. I did my first race in1985
@philriopel Sorry - on my way back to Europe this week.  Have a good time in Bend - looping around Bachelor is always a nice ride.
@arlynasch Sorry...  :-)
@NikkiCyp Thanks!  It was great to be back!
Back at the hotel relaxing. This week has been good to awaken the legs from hibernation. 5th overall. Elk Grove this year was fantastic !
Just got to the Tour Elk Grove. Looking forward to the 3days of racing.

@DaveJustDave Drives great, but I'm stuck in Salt Lake City with a $1000 tire bill and a $3000 shocks/struts bill! I'll sell it cheap... :-)
San Diego Volo just did the alignment before we left. Don't recommend them. I got a bad history of work done there.
Discount Tire in Grand Junction saved me ! Thanks Guys !
Left, Lance's house. Blew out one rear tire on the Volo V70R near grand junction. The other one was down to the wire metal.

Ranchhouse Diner for dinner tonight. Great steak with a little religion on the side... :) Road trip! Great find in Snowville, UT.
That's what road trips all about !
On my way to Aspen. Just rode through thunder, lightning, rail, hail. And now having dinner at the Meat Hook in Burns, Oregon.
@amytoddb The car had guys from the Oregonian newspaper - following me for the day for an interview.
@italianchick111 Sweet picture!
Second day on the bike and the leg feels good!
@lak1 Good call!
@lak1 That's what I was thinking!
@chef_duffy Hey Duffy!  I have a broken leg, but good otherwise.  Missing your cooking!
Shooting for the Tour still.
Yup - as some of you were thinking, pain after 7 days off isn't quite right. Did an MRI today and I have stable fracture of the tibia.
Just finished my first ride after the crash at the Giro. 2:15 ride time. The leg was still a little sore. Tomorrow's ride will tell me more
I was just tell my friend Jan.  I needed to fix that door bell, just for the control officer.
Out of comp control this morning. That's # 20something, I'm losing count. Good thing he knocked hard because the door bell was broken.
I'm out of the Giro. Going home tomorrow. Here's the last of the Giro blogs   http://blog.oregonlive.com/horner/  Hope you enjoyed them !

@kentwells No worries - thanks for the help!

But we all finished in one piece without any other drama, so it was a successful day!
Today was totally smooth until 2 to go - then some crashes slowed the field up.  I gave my bike to Levi after his bike got hit from behind.
@kentwells That's not me - that was a BMC rider going down, I was lucky enough to keep off of the pavement today...
Levi blazed the course to another win and gave us some more time to play with for the coming stages. The Giro is looking good !
After all the work yesterday I got a bit of a day off today. Slept 10 hours then rolled the TT steady and hard but never a 100%.
I'm going with drug controllers to the race in their car now because I still can't pee.
Out of competition control again. This time before the race. And I still can't pee !
They say 15,000 bees holding up the plane. Who counted?
I assume its honey they want. Cause I don't know of any other thing bees would want!
To a change of plans. Now going to Gila instead of Aspen. Now stick at the airport. The plane is being held for ransom!
took the control officers with me to Chipolte for dinner. Cause they have to wait 2 hours after training for Blood. Woke up this morning
What a night and next day. Trained 5 hours yesterday, UCI control test waiting for me. Blood and urine.
I'm pretty sure I got the only sunny spot in San Diego right now.
Sitting in the sun having a coke and snickers on a training break. Can't wait until the Body feels a 100% again.
Just finished up with another out of competition test. Love peeing in a cup first this in the morning. Living the dream
@jjcoffman Heading back to Europe soon - just before the Giro.
Sitting at home with my friend "The Stick" and watching B-ball on TV
@JulieHarden That's a great idea!
All those fractures and I can still train. But can't fall down any more the Doct says !
Just left the doctors office. Lots of fractures. 1 in the callor bone. 2 in the #2Rib. And a possible fracture in the #3 Rib.
Back in Bend on the home trainer. Trying to keep the form up after the crash. The Giro still looks good but no chance to make the classics.
Well the legs were great. But sometimes you more luck then legs. Flying back to the states today. X-rays show nothing broken. Theresthe luck
@janibrajkovic hey jani this is Horner's GF. Can you tell chris I got his message? Thanks!
On the team bus to the start of a cold and wet stage2 Pais-Vasco.
Stage 1 at Pais Vasco in the bank. The team is looking great. Alberto looks to be in great form still.
Alberto is still looking good on the climbs !
Went out training on the first stage of Pais Vasco today. The final is going to be real hard this year. Last climb is 20+% for 1.5 K
It was 35degrees today when I left the house in Bend. 95miles, 243 watts avg. All the hard training is done. Almost race time !
Training in San Diego is over now. On my way to Bend Oregon for 2days. Then off to Pais Vasco. The last two weeks have been great training
@jjcoffman Heading over for Pais Vasco this weekend after I see the kids for a few days.
@sunnysidegaryb Great to hear!  Tell Billy hi and congrats for me!
Trained with Carl Decker today. Pro mountain biker from Bend Oregon. First two hours we averaged 270 watts. Finished with 240 watts@ 4 hours
Heading out for a ride. Lots of sun in San Diego. The knee is has been good all week. So tomorrow starts the real training.
@cianciola Don't worry - they'll be back!  They're from the donut shop around the corner from my house.  A few more days...
3 days on the bike and knee is good.  Should be back to full training soon!  Cutting back on the donuts worked, the weight is good to go!
@marinacyclist Too many trucks...  And expensive mustangs...
@KendrickWong That is a great pic!
First day on the bike in two weeks. The knee is finally starting to feel better off the bike, so I hope it holds up.
And no near claws. Ok two donuts on the Monday after ToC. I even made a salad last night.
Sitting at the kids dentist. Have not ridden the bike since ToC. No candy bars and down to one coke a day.
@dullardtrite no but probably for MSG... :)
Out of comp drug control this morning. Living the dream. That's #9 since the start of December.
Two days after ToC. Two visit to the Doctor for the knee and the rest of the time spent on the couch. Damn hard race !
@lancearmstrong 9 Packets is nothing - that's just breakfast!
