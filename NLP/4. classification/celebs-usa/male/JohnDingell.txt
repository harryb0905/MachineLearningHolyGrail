The Lovely Deborah is insisting I rest and stay off here, but after long negotiations we've worked out a deal where she'll keep up with Twitter for me as I dictate the messages. I want to thank you all for your incredibly kind words and prayers. You're not done with me just yet.
Buddy, I think you might want to sit this one out. https://t.co/tURD30IYNj
Someone told me that the man behind everyone's favorite cup of coffee might run for President and I just want to wish @TimHortons the very best. You have my support.
A lot of great candidates in the mix this election. https://t.co/ccKgfsyk7x
Has he apologized yet?
Trump caved and called it a deal.
The American people wait with bated breath as their idiot president announces something he could have done 35 days ago to avoid this national disgrace of a shutdown. The Art of the Deal.

As this Congress begins, a bit of advice for new Members that I received back in 1955:  For the next six months you're going to wonder how the hell you got here. Then one day you'll come on to the House floor, look around, and wonder how in the hell all the other fools got here.
God bless America. Congratulations, Congresswoman. I can‚Äôt wait to see all you will accomplish for our nation. #Hope #Ilhan https://t.co/XlHtLbt6PB

The election is over. Trump controls the Senate and Democrats control the House. We must all work together for the good of the country and bring the end of this silly bickering. The votes are in and the people have spoken. Know that we are one nation and only survive in that way.
Two years ago, after Trump was declared the winner, I gave a talk and said, "I think I speak for everyone, including my Republican friends here, when I say that I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what the hell happened.‚Äù  Today, I know exactly what the hell happened: America won.

Never before in history of organized government can anyone recall so much stupidity accomplished by so few in so short amount of time. Editorials across the country lead us to believe we are becoming a banana republic. My fellow Americans, pray for our beloved country.
Why is the Senate behaving in such a sneaky and secretive way to deny access to the members of the their needs and wishes? Denial of the rights of the elected representatives of the people is morally and constitutionally wrong.
There were no limits or constrictions on this rule. It was the view of myself and other chairmen that this was a constitutional right which could not be interfered with.
In more than 16 years as chairman of a major investigative committee of the House and a number of years as chairman of investigative subcommittees, the rule of the House was that any member is entitled to have full access to any paper or information in the committee‚Äôs possession.

Great to see Trump receiving praise and taking credit for doing a thing he said he couldn‚Äôt do that doesn‚Äôt even actually do the one thing we need it to do.

To be clear, Trump isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù from the Iran deal. He‚Äôs violating it. America made a promise to our greatest allies and this clown is now breaking it for no good reason. A dangerous precedent set.
Above all, I miss having a literate president.
Nearly 24 hours later and ‚ÄúBe Best‚Äù still makes no sense for a number of reasons, chief among them the fact that being the absolute worst is the only thing this president and his administration have shown they‚Äôre any good at.

Who the hell fires a priest?
The decision by @SpeakerRyan to oust Father Conroy is a great disservice to the body and to our nation. It is my hope that he will soon provide answers as to why this decision was made. Based on early press reports, I share the concerns of many.
The House Chaplain is an important position for the institution, no matter their denomination. His or her words open the House every day, and if more membets sat and listened to their counsel this country would be better off.
On the rare occasions that I visit Capitol Hill, one if the first people I go see is Father Conroy. He was a source of advice and counsel that I relied on during my time in Congress, and he‚Äôs one of the more honorable and dignified individuals found in that building these days.

99% of what @realDonaldTrump says is right out of the south end of a northbound mule.
The president looks especially orange today.
If you‚Äôre lucky enough to make it to 91 years old, pay attention to where you‚Äôre walking. Took a fall and ended up hanging out here at @GWHospital with a bum leg.  Feeling good though. Particularly glad I‚Äôm not a horse.
This Republican tax bill is a damn scam. Vote them all out.
The best job in America is the guy who gets to tell Trump he misspelled a bunch of words in his stupid tweets.  I‚Äôd come out of retirement if you promised me I could do that every day.
Our president is busy not watching TV again. https://t.co/aeczJ9KhAc

Quote tweet this and tell me WHO your Senator is, how they plan to vote on this #GOPTaxScam bill, and what YOU‚ÄôRE going to do about it.  I‚Äôll retweet the best responses I get throughout the weekend.
I will march in the damn streets again if I have to. The people‚Äôs voices will be heard, today and every day forward, election year or not.  Vote NO on this #GOPTaxScam.
If your Senators are voting no, contact their campaigns tomorrow and offer a kind word, a moment of your time, or a donation.  If your Senators are voting yes, call THEIR OPPONENTS‚Äô campaigns tomorrow and offer a kind word, a moment of your time, or a donation. Or just move. https://t.co/1JGG8TG9Dp
99% of you are in no way horses in this metaphor. You‚Äôre the damn birds. Call and yell at your Senator NOW. The number is 202-224-3121. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/Ngdq3uWqji
@rockrichard It‚Äôs a damn crime, really.
Today, Republicans prefer to call it ‚Äútrickle-down economics‚Äù because what they‚Äôre actully doing is pissing on your leg and telling you it‚Äôs raining.  The truth is this #GOPTaxScam is nothing but a huge tax cut for the rich at the expense of everyone else.
Back in the 1800s, supply-side economics was called the ‚Äúhorse &amp; sparrow‚Äù theory, the belief that if you fed the horse plenty of oats, enough would pass through onto the road to feed the sparrows.  A perfect descriptor for this horseshit idea.

This block of wood helped create Medicare, Medicaid, ACA, expended care for millions and patient rights &amp; protections we'd never had before.

Well, that's that. Goodnight.
Actual reforms can be made to improve the Affordable Care Act. This rushed, reckless repeal bill is not that. Too many people will be hurt.
Hell, I don't even remember why I started telling this story, except to urge folks to call their Congressperson and demand more from them.
They spent nearly a decade doing everything they could to undermine the ACA, and now throw their hands up in the air and declare it broken.
They haven't thought about the 24 million estimated to lose their coverage, or the millions more who have benefited from Medicaid expansion.
This week, House Republicans are planning to vote to undo all that progress, taking us backward in the fight for universal, affordable care.
7 years ago this week, I sat with @POTUS44 &amp; others as decades of our collective hard work became law. Or as @JoeBiden called it: a big deal https://t.co/PbO1R4L4oF
Millions now have coverage they never had before. Lifesaving screenings. Preventive care. Affordable rates &amp; subsidies that SCALE with cost.
Was Obamacare perfect? Hell no. The only perfect law was handed to Moses on stone tablets by God himself. Obamacare was an important start.
[My friend Jon Stewart would go on to use that same gavel to enjoy a snack on @TheDailyShow program later that year] https://t.co/h1oJqs3AlK
When the ACA was up in the House, leadership asked me to preside over part of the debate. I accepted with one term: I'm bringing my gavel. https://t.co/8fIPusoEIV
Before this, many had to decide between bankruptcy or death. Children hit lifetime caps. Cancer &amp; being a woman were preexisting conditions.
So we fought to expand coverage. We worked to lower costs. We wanted the American people to finally KNOW what their plan actually included.
Our bill aimed to bring certainty to an uncertain experience. You don't hope to have to use insurance. But if you do, it needs be damn good.
Hearing after hearing, amendment after amendment. We took the time to hear concerns from all.  Republicans were invited, too. They declined.
Nevertheless, we persisted. It was an honor to work with so many great champions of our nation in helping to craft the Affordable Care Act.
We took another shot in the 90s but again came up short. You know who knew damn well how complicated health care could be?  @HillaryClinton.
Over the years we'd create the National Institutes of Health, the Children's Health Insurance Program, &amp; many other efforts to improve care.
It was an accomplishment but was not my end goal. I continued to reintroduce my father's bill every year. As pieces of it slowly became law.
It's tough to see in the photo, but I had McCormack &amp; others sign the gavel. They made me sign too. All told, my pop would have been proud.
It took years to work through, but then-Speaker McCormack brought our bill to the floor in 65 and gave me the honor of gaveling its passage. https://t.co/Zg1R2I86xu
I was a pup at the time, but I began working with my colleagues on Medicare legislation. Cecil King. Aime Forand. My dear friend John Moss. https://t.co/Q033Fw2XGV
In 1957--and every Congress thereafter--I'd reintroduce my father's bill &amp; work to create a national program to take care of those in need.
He never would get to see universal health care become law. He passed in 55 and I decided to run to replace him, vowing to keep up his work.
But his effort wasn't as successful in '43. The Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill to create a national health program ultimately died in committee.
He spent the decade prior fighting like hell to pass Social Security &amp; see it signed into law. And he did. Big nose &amp; mustache in the back. https://t.co/NechCqycRI
In 1943, my father was one of the first people to introduce comprehensive health care reform in Congress, a single-payer system for all.
Who knew health care could be so complicated?

Perhaps it wasn't the books' fault.  I'll blame Trump.
Left some books by the bed. Tripped getting up during the night. A black eye &amp; some stitches, but I'm fine.  Who knew reading was dangerous?
Trump's taxes are important, but I'm waiting on the long-form.
Most interesting # in Trump's taxes: 24,000,000.  Oh no wait that's just how many Americans will lose health care under his terrible plan.
Listened to 5 mins of @PressSec's briefing.  GOP repeal sounds more and more like a "three-pronged" plan to screw over the American people.
Trumpcare should now die on the vine as the terrible legislation it is.

House GOP had the better half of a decade to provide a viable alternative to the ACA. Instead, they scribbled some tax cuts on a bar napkin.
There's an old circus saying that when things go wrong, send in the clowns. 45+ days in, I'm not certain you can clown your way out of this.
Halloween isn't until the end of Oct. Perhaps POTUS find a better use of his time than trying to scare the shit out of the American people.

That's all I've got for now. Just wanted to share. I'll come back later on and yell about something else, I'm sure.
I look forward to living up to Adams's wish, FDR's belief, &amp; the promise we make to our children to leave this place better than we found it
But also vote against the most crude &amp; reckless candidate I've ever seen. A man who does not belong to the Republican party I knew or know.
We have a unique opportunity to not only elect one of the wisest &amp; most qualified individuals to ever run for the highest office in America,
He wrote of Men because most did not yet recognize that women would one day make their voices heard and prove they could do or be anything.
FDR ordered this inscribed into the fireplace where our President gathers with world leaders and foreign dignitaries.
...May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof."
He wrote: "I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House &amp; all that shall hereafter inhabit it....
1800. Sorry.
In it, he updated her on his travels and some personal affairs, but he closed with a blessing that always struck me--and FDR--as meaningful.
The blessing was actually written by John Adams, an excerpt of a letter he wrote to his wife Abigail in 1900.
In 1945, Franklin Roosevelt ordered a blessing carved into the stone fireplace of the White House State Dining Room, where it remains.
There's a old story that's been swimming around in my head in recent days and I thought I would share it with you if that is alright.
It's too damn early in the day for garbage like this. https://t.co/ljQpki8Ctl

Boy was I wrong. What a series.
Friendly reminder that @tigers pitchers and catchers report in ~107 days.
Trump is hoping this game stays tied so his stupid "WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE!" line might begin to make some sort of sense.

Only coherent sentence out of his mouth was his description of @HillaryClinton's hard work &amp; commitment.  I couldn't agree more. #ImWithHer
It's increasingly clear that Trump just learned the word "Latino" last week.
Donald Trump just admitted that he does and has not paid federal income taxes.
"I know nothing about Russia. - @realDonaldTrump  Sounds real safe.
This man is a menace.
RT if you're more scared of a Donald Trump presidency than you are of ISIS.
That's offensive to locker rooms.
Trump holds the debate microphone like an Olive Garden breadstick he's not certain he wants to eat.
Well, this is all pretty damn surreal.

Pence appeared relaxed, but you could tell he was as uncomfortable as a frog in a skillet defending the indefensible. Must be easier to lie.
Okay, now prove it. https://t.co/kIkta539sM
Seeing TV pundits imply Pence "won" debate, then conduct interview after interview about offensive tweets, Russia, Putin, taxes, etc.  Cool.
This is a real tweet. https://t.co/ym3vgx2NvZ
Pence did a great job. Of not answering a single question asked of him &amp; lying about offensive things his goofy, terrible running mate said.
"Trump didn't say that." - Mike Pence, responding to terrible things Trump definitely said. #VPDebate
Mike Pence continually threatens to defend Trump's horrible comments, then immediately discusses an unrelated topic.  A profile in courage.
Tonight is a debate between Pence and Trump. Perhaps they should get their own failed houses in order before they come asking for our votes.
This is the most accurate observation I've seen tonight. #VPDebate https://t.co/4fYUtatrAu
I wish Mike Pence would share with us the questions he thinks he's being asked. #VPDebate

Millennial Trump supporter on MSNBC is referring to her fellow millennials as millenniums, and I'm just not sure what to think.

I honestly believe @HillaryClinton could beat him in an arm wrestling match tonight.
Trump believes that his best asset is his temperament. I quit.
Trump: "I haven't given lots of thought to NATO."  We've noticed.
It appears he's confused even his own surrogates. https://t.co/cuounEFExL
I, too, am concerned about The Cyber.
Trump has the sniffles. Sounds like pneumonia to me.
Trump didn't stop questioning @POTUS's birthplace because he was wrong, he stopped because he had other awful idiotic things to obsess over.
"I have investments there..." "I have properties there..." "I have financial dealings there..."  This man could not be more out of touch.
They said there'd be no commercial interruptions tonight but here this snake oil salesman is, hawking his stupid hotel.
Lists of Banks is the new Binders of Women.  Republican nominees learn nothing.
Trump takes time out of avoiding a question of where his tax returns are to brag about how much he made last year. And I'm yelling at my TV.
Hillary Clinton is calm, honest, &amp; speaking the truth.  Donald Trump is the guy who tries to start a fistfight with you over a parking spot.
Trump rooted for American families to fail in the worst downturn since the Depression. His response?  "That's called business, by the way."
"Donald, it's good to be with you."  Five Pinocchios.
No bathroom break for 90 minutes? Holy hell. I should just watch the Tigers game
Never thought I'd agree with the Washington Free Beacon, but these are strange times. https://t.co/K8IO6OOURK

Well. Anything else on TV?
Ate too many waffles for lunch and napped through the first half of the game. Looking good, @UMichFootball.

Each week, @chucktodd fills a Nats hat with tiny pieces of paper with times written on them.  The one he chooses is when @meetthepress airs.
Is there a way to just retweet @HillaryClinton's last 87 tweets? She perfectly boiled down the choice voters have. https://t.co/noPFKBcoNc
Muhammad Ali didn't transcend race.  He was Black. Powerful. Confident.  He was everything that hateful people feared.  He was the Greatest.

@BeckleyStover I can't find it on my television.
Switching from this Tigers game to the NBA Finals, because if you can't watch a Michigan team win, you may as well watch an Ohio team lose.
@noahmanger Easy there, pally.
I'm just saying, @tigers. https://t.co/315sz1jhTe
This was just the kind of threat they needed.
Ha! I've got to be better company than that one list I recently saw your name on, right? Thanks for your kindness. https://t.co/pPoxHaCM5K

2-0 Tigers
When the @tigers play night games on a west cost swing, it is perfectly acceptable to take 2-3 pregame naps. 4-5 if you're a pro like me.
Anyone willing to help teach an 89-year old man how @kickstarter works? https://t.co/q58KGcCgu3

Fantastic display from @BradAusmus07 tonight. Gotta hold their feet to the fire on bad calls. Now win this thing, @tigers.

The two remaining GOP candidates to be President of the United States have spent the day discussing JFK assassination conspiracy theories.

Game actually ended in a 1-1 tie. Mueller had to have thrown at least 400 pitches. He was a nice guy, but I'd be madder than a boiled owl.
It was hotter than Chinese mustard out there, too. O'Neill came walking out to pull him and motioned for Dizzy Trout from the bullpen.
Hell, I once saw Les Mueller leave the Tigers, fight in WWII, and return in '45 to throw 19 &amp; 2/3 innings in one game. Barely broke a sweat.
Turns out the key to a no-hitter is throwing as few pitches as possible so your manager doesn't just come in and screw the whole thing up.
The @DetroitPistons are going to the playoffs?  The @DetroitPistons are going to the playoffs.

Oh. Wow.
Big win for @umichbball. #GoBlue
The GOP debates are just so much more fun to watch. Sensible policy discussions are boring.
Downton Abbey looks like a really exciting show.
I guess I'll watch this debate.
Gotta say, attacking our sitting President AND a civil rights icon in the same day is one hell of a Democratic primary election strategy.
No matter who you are or who you're voting for, you should honestly think twice about your choices in life if you're attacking @repjohnlewis

Congratulations to Ted Cruz on winning the critically important primary state that also gave us President Santorum and President Huckabee.
The best thing about the Iowa Caucus is that it only happens once every four years.

Is Jeb Bush still running for President?
Skipped debate, but if Twitter is any indication it sounds like the same cesspool of terrible ideas as last time.  Wake me up in November.
Golly. You don't tweet for a week or two &amp; you start getting calls at the house asking if you're still kicking.  Old people have lives, too.
Pistons beat the Warriors. Holy cats. Must have done it for Big Ben.
@darreldrowland "often appears to be"
These things having been said, he's a nice fella who often appears to be the most levelheaded of the lot. He just enjoys telling a story.
John Kasich tells more "back in my day" rocking chair stories than me or anyone I know, and I was born during the Coolidge administration.
I'm opposed to the PTT.
Amazing to remember that this is the very same Jeb Bush who called for religious tests for refugees.
Donald Trump is telling others that their statements are offensive.  Drink.

@JakeSherman That's the only thing about this game that's bringing me joy right now, pal.
@skitchP I'm not sure which gang of misfits deserves you more.
Why do I even get this channel? At his point, I'd rather not. If I have to sit through another 15 minute commercial about dolphins...
@skitchP Less. Always less. Never tweet.

Turns out I'm older than Wrigley Field's ivy. Go figure.
@Buick59 Actually, no.
A good way to avoid further confusion with the ivy would be to just cut the damn ivy.
A proper investigation needs fundamental fairness and a search for facts. House GOP's Benghazi panel lacks both.  https://t.co/B8vgaEBat0
A few more Republicans jumping in would probably be good for their party.  I can't imagine having to pick a President from that strange lot.
A "source familiar with my thinking" says I'm just going to sit here &amp; watch whatever it is they're calling the Military Channel this week.
Despite anything the Washington Post may report, I'm not running for President in 2016.  Yet.

A great way to test out a new pacemaker is to watch the Michigan-Michigan State game.  Go Blue.
I'm about as old school as they get, but I'll be damned if I don't appreciate a good high stakes bat flip every now and then.
Baseball won. For now.
Do I watch Baseball or the Democratic debate?

@vj44 Feeling better every minute. Thank you for your kindness and your friendship.
I fought for universal healthcare for 89 yrs and forgot to slip in one damn line requiring super-long phone chargers during hospital stays.
It always feels like Apple makes their phone chargers 6" shorter than the distance from the outlet to wherever the hell you need your phone.
Went in for heart surgery and came out to a new "Moments" button on Twitter. Not sure which one is more annoying so far.
Dingell for Speaker.
It wasn't a heart attack, but doctors are recommending I do all I can to try to forget the end of that Lions game. Here for a few more days.
Back in the hospital. Being old sucks.
Twitter just recommended that I follow @fart.  I worry I'm no longer allowed to be mad at anyone who giggles at my name.

@JakeSherman SCOOP: It won't be pretty.
@JakeSherman Driver doesnt matter to a pack like this. Making great big speeches on the floor before they even know where the restrooms are.
.@JakeSherman A good man who'll find happiness long before his caucus figures out what the hell to do. The dog has caught the car. Now what?
@skitchP Sounds about right.
@BYBKurt No such thing, pally.
Read a book all day and didn't catch any news. What'd I miss?
.@RepDianaDeGette Ha! Peyton Manning is my age, so it may very well come down to defense for you. Miss you, dear friend.
Hate to see Scott Walker go knowing he'll now be able to dedicate his full attention to continuing to be the worst governor in America.
This is still true, you know.
I was having such a good day. Then I turned the Tigers game on.
Alright. What'd I miss?

And yes, I realize my idea of baseball in its prime was paying a nickel to catch the bus to see Schoolboy pitch 11 or 12 innings, but still.
Today, I can't do a thing without this damn phone buzzing and binging and ringing and ruining everything once holy about baseball.
