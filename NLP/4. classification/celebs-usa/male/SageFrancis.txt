@DANIELmadison The next time we cross paths, I want to embarrass myself by showing you my one and only sure-shot way of impressing my family.
My past life of doing card tricks in order to make a living in NYC parks is really paying off with my fiance and the kids. It was a weird hustle back then &amp; it's even a weirder flex at this stage in life, so I waited to show it off. Gotta pick your spots. "Pick a card...any card" https://t.co/ZfAsmRh60Y
@matzar12 @ceschi @olde_fortran hahaaaaaaa. This is so on brand for 2019.
@ceschi @olde_fortran Hahaa. Oh man. I know this sounds awful, but let's set up an indie Pay Per View throwdown. We can share all proceeds and donate to our causes. Better yet, we can be on the same tag-team and fight whoever pays the highest fee for the satisfaction of fighting us for charity. Yesss.
We're reaching the conclusion of another #Caturday &amp; I'm watching the #MakeEmPurr video because I'm overdue for an ugly cry: https://t.co/wlPLfYDiRX I gave a shout out to the animal hospital that saved my baby in the #CopperGone album's liner notes. Time for me to slip 'em a copy
@olde_fortran You think you could defeat me in physical combat? I mean...you have a strong chin and all according to your profile pic, but I'm covering mine. Let's...do...this!
@mcsole @ceschi @stimulator @IGD_News @crimethinc @scott_crow @mckenziewark You may have been too caught up in your own manic-driven hype machine back in the day to realize how crucial you were to several artists by giving them a launchpad into the industry which resulted in many long careers. It was my honor and privilege to reciprocate when I was able.
A semi-nuanced take on Robert Kraft from a lifelong Patriots fan: * Got no love for billionaires. Money hoarders get zero passes. * Please don't release the video. Wait...maybe. OK do it. * Sexwork shaming is bad. Human trafficking is worse. * Brady still the üêê so stfu (sorry.)
@lisagunns @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen @DJZOLE @VOCKAHREDU @SFRupdates Please road trip. Road trips are wonderful. But EBM will be hitting MN at some point in 2019. Fo' sho'.
@PrezCarezz @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen @DJZOLE @VOCKAHREDU @SFRupdates @MercuryLoungeNY Actually, I just went to their website, searched our show, clicked on "tickets" and it brought me to the page I initially showed you. I'm not sure how you happened upon that "ticket" website, but it's a sham site.
@PrezCarezz @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen @DJZOLE @VOCKAHREDU @SFRupdates That‚Äôs bizarre. I‚Äôll look into it and see if @MercuryLoungeNY can fix that.

@PecheyYellow @EpicBeardMen @doseonetweets @YoniWolf @jelanticon Haha no. Not at all. However, the guy I had the epic dance battle with was an intern at Epitaph and it was his last day so we made a thing of it. He went on to become a lawyer. https://t.co/yZnSjfxcKD
#TBT 2001. The day after Scribble Jam battles involved the lingering artists taking to the stage and doing the types of off-the-cuff performances you wouldn't experience anywhere else.

@dxferris I *just* put this on a mixtape for my gal last night. Crazy.
@chthoniclife @EpicBeardMen It‚Äôs more exhausting trying to find an Australian booking agent. We‚Äôd love to tour there though.
@casOne1 They‚Äôre pretty good eaters for the most part. In a pinch, I find that if I make it look like I‚Äôm trying to sneak food off of their plate they‚Äôll become territorial and eat it before I can get it. That trick will only last so long.
The amount of negotiations I had to rifle through with two toddlers in order to get them to bed in record time was impressive tonight. Somebody call the local news. I‚Äôm officially ready for the bar exam.

@seaforeex @mcsole Ha. I'm not even sure if @mcsole remembers, but that's the name that was used for questionable fans. When you couldn't really tell if they were pumped on our stuff due its content and ingenuity or because of the lack of melanin. That was my interpretation of it anyway.
@SteelyLiz @EpicBeardMen We'll most likely return to the UK in August. Get chuffed!

@seezmics It looks like an egg before it ripens. Just found that out recently.
@kellyk2420 Yes, the dark web pays me to run dumb polls on Twitter to see what kind of wonderful responses I receive and from whom. You're on the list now, buddy. You're on the list!
@Whospaul Ha. I have the full box set. But I save that for when my internet goes out.
I don‚Äôt have cable and I mostly use Netflix for the TV. I have Amazon Prime but I feel so technologically inept with my old ‚Äúsmart‚Äù TV that I‚Äôve convinced myself it‚Äôll be too much trouble to get their video stuff to work so I never tried. I am doing...

@grimeduchess It was a pretty bad dream but that part made up for it.
In my dream last night the restaurant I was in held all their ketchup in big round bowls, so I was able to quickly dip my hands in and splash my face with it to disguise all the blood. I was like, ‚ÄúAaagghh look at me, I‚ÄôM KETCHUP GUYYYY!‚Äù They loved it. #ThePerfectCrime
I‚Äôd like for my Euro &amp; UK fans to keep an eye out for @freeleereed‚Äôs shows this summer. @SFRupdates put out his latest album and I love his performance style. That‚Äôs what got me interested. @EpicBeardMen will be there from late June til August. He‚Äôs there before us. Double whammy https://t.co/9g6Wn9QigQ
@mcsole @BillJackson84 Now that I think of it, that line inspired my lyric on "Different" from Personal Journals: "If I'm a poor man's version of anything it's my self-perception."
@BillJackson84 @mcsole Haha no. We did tour together several years later though and got along well. I'm pretty sure he had little to no idea who I was at Scribble, but he knew I was working with anticon which he equated with sole and that was his battle rap zinger. Better than being called Vanilla Ice.
@SmalltimeJones @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @VOCKAHREDU @DJZOLE Ha. Yummmm. Looking forward to it. https://t.co/QCvXWT97B4

@TheRealJonDub I just started watching Mad Men, and I know I'm late, so I was meaning to look into all the memes I missed about them sounding exactly alike. If I'm the first to point this out then I expect a parade.

@xaanzmasque @EpicBeardMen They passed on last year's tour and they're scared about Easter affecting attendance this time through. Which makes a lot of sense because we're all conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas. Heh.
@cspf42 @TheNickGreene00 @EpicBeardMen @CultureRoom @RevolutionLive That was a special circumstance as it was someone's attempt at throwing a "festival" in a restaurant's parking lot. Promotion wasn't their strong point. But I definitely expect to be back in Orlando. Those shows almost always kill.
@TheNickGreene00 @EpicBeardMen Yo...haha. I'd love to. I'll dedicate a full segment of the podcast explaining why Atlanta and a lot of the south is difficult for us to play after the past few years of attendance at indie-rap shows dwindling. Which I hate. Because I love those territories.
@PupilofSociety @EpicBeardMen San Dee-yayyyyyyy. Go: https://t.co/eL4o6JuoQo

@CaseyMcRae5 I suggest waiting until we figure out the exact venue. Looks like there might be a venue change.
@michelleisapunk @SFRupdates @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @VOCKAHREDU @DJZOLE I'll try to hit upstate NY before the end of the year. Got lots of places I need to revisit but for some reason it didn't work out on this tour.

@ImDopeNasty @DJZOLE @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen It's possible the Vegas venue will change. We'll know in a couple days. Stay tuned.
@johnny_hempseed I heard hempseed makes the best stinkiest colognes! 311 truthers need to stop advertising on my feed.
@JarydBurcham @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @VOCKAHREDU @DJZOLE @SFRupdates Unfortunately, yes. My favorite US city though.
@Rob_Sonic @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @VOCKAHREDU @DJZOLE @SFRupdates We decided to wait until April to start any touring as we've decided we no longer want to battle any of those vortexes on the road. Glad you didn't get sucked all the way in. Maybe we can work something out on the east coast? NYC if nothing else.
@StoicSarcasm @EpicBeardMen Probably not until a full Canadian tour gets worked out. Not sure who to go through for that.
@dxferris I enjoyed that. It was like Anal Cunt covering 311.
@NeonReverb @BDolanSFR @BunkhouseLV Looks like that place may have been double booked. We're holding our breath to see if this show will actually happen or not.
@megaangeorge @EpicBeardMen We'll tour mainland Europe in June/July and I expect the UK tour to happen in August.
RT the @EpicBeardMen tweet if you would like to be personally messaged when all #ComeToTheSandDunes tour dates and tickets are available.

@roach You sure can. You don't need to though. Just happy to have a show in ol' Oaktown that people will come out to.

@RodneyAnon If you want any stage time just say the word. We're flying by the seat of our pants right now, and I happen to be wearing chaps. But, yes, I'm psyched to see you there.
@GoatHurdurJesus That's the ending.
@ceschi Wait, which one? ha
@duggo81 Yeah, he did that beat. There's actually a second verse that I edited out as I ended up using the lyrics on "The Buzz Kill" from A Healthy Distrust. I think I'll include the full version on the mixtape boxset I'm putting together. Might as well.
@SpeechDevRecs @Tyxiaa You don't want these hands!

@JussSomeDude @thetruemuz I didn't start seeing a doctor until the beginning of last year, and there's the option of communicating with them through an email portal. I've researched chiropractic shit before and I don't really think I'll ever mess with that.
@thetruemuz OK, good. I'll believe you for one more day. But I can't move well or sleep and three days of being like this might result in an email to my doctor which I hope she won't answer to.
@MChurch007 hahaaaa. WTF is going on? Our bodies need to fall back.
@floatvoid Dude. This is exactly what I didn't want to hear. But thank you.
It's finally warm enough for the two youngins to run around outside, and here I am dealing with a left leg that's been asleep for two days due to something I pulled in my back. I refuse to look this issue up on WebMD because I'm not ready to die.

@DeadSeaGulls @Shvnghii Sorry to hear about a knife being pulled on you though. This is the 1st I've heard of anything like that in all my years of performing. I've had my own shitty experiences out there including having tour banners &amp; stuff like that stolen from the stage. SLC is officially on notice!
@DeadSeaGulls @Shvnghii I'm going to attribute that to SLC weirdness. Only hardcore crew on the east coast I knew to do fucked up "gang" shit was FSU. An apropos acronym (Fuck Shit Up.)

@RandomishLode @SFRupdates Awesome. Thank you very much. I can't get too into this at the moment as we're wrapping up all album and tour details, but I will definitely play around with it soon and try to get it populated. Salute!
@RandomishLode @SFRupdates Do I have to invite people or can they automatically subscribe? I'd prefer the latter.
@RandomishLode @SFRupdates SageFrancisSFR
@RandomishLode That would be cool. Not sure how active it would be, but at least I can update it and keep it relevant to all things @SFRupdates
@PecheyYellow Back on the road in April for the @EpicBeardMen tour. Announcement coming soon!

Dear @Reddit,  This is like when @YouTube banned me for a couple years for impersonating myself, but I'd like to think you're better than that and can maybe help out? If not, no worries.

This was so long ago, New Englanders went to a rap battle on Super Bowl Sunday instead of being invested in the game. Because the Pats were pretty atrocious our whole life up until that point. To put it into perspective. And we may revert back to that in a year or two. No rush!
@itZpoisonous After 20 years of me supplying everyone with more ammo than they'd know what to do with? Hmmm. Noooooo thanks. ha
As a fan of pretty much everyone in that battle, while I was relatively unknown, I had that sneak attack advantage. That kicked off a lot of things for me and I remember it well. 20 yrs ago though...wow. Glad to see most of us still active &amp; doing cool shit. #NewEnglandResilience https://t.co/5gGhOS0ERn

@ChristianArcand Just want to say @adamjones985 is wrong about Edelman "touching the ball." The replays clearly showed that the ball missed both hands. But the replays also showed there was an optical illusion making it look like the far hand grazed it. But, yeah, didn't matter.
@katiearina Ha. I never thought about that until now. Time flies though. Keep the butterfly nets handy.

@deprivedanxiety Lucifer was an angel. I guess that‚Äôs what we were both riffing on in the language  Keep digging though. I like it!

@mcsole I like guns better than control.  But I like gun control.  Many reasons for that here.  In our condition. In our situation.
@SSRob44 And, again, there's a lot more accessible care for the citizens of Canada.  And, again, another unique situation. Their guns are mainly for hunting. Way less guns in Australia. Almost none. Despite all the vicious muscle-bound kangaroos. Heh. Again, another unique situation.
A possible answer is that it boils down to economics and how the people are treated overall. The majority of Swiss citizens are paid well and treated well. And, no joke, their streets glitter. Switzerland has a unique &amp; sordid history overall. I‚Äôd say this is a false equivalent. https://t.co/2sMspwiUiu

@Booker_T1000 @SFRupdates Last year @BDolanSFR laid out a case for why we should keep Knowmore afloat, but it would require support from the public via financial support. People didn't donate the amount that was needed and that's pretty much that. Sad, but such is life sometimes. It was a useful service.
@Booker_T1000 @SFRupdates That's not too far off. But as I just moved from the home I've lived in my whole life, I'm clearing it out bit by bit and dropping off all my memorabilia to the office.
@Booker_T1000 I don't think we do. If @SFRupdates is aware of one kicking around they'll holler atcha. Maybe I left one from my own collection at the office, but I'm not seeing it at the moment.

Dumb dream logic is dumb.  But there's something to it.
Example: One of the earliest dreams I can remember is images of people's faces flying with the clouds. If your face showed up, it meant you were going to die that day. Everyone was always looking up. The person I was with saw their face, which resulted in a horribly sad breakdown

@prolyphic @Metermaids Haaaa. Awwww.
@moodieblack1 Why not have Bjork?! Ha. Logistics and other complicated stuff I suppose. But I‚Äôd love to see a show of yours someday.
What a way to close out my year of shows. Thank you @DeadMilkmen &amp; @IrvingPlaza for having me along. I got home much too late on too little sleep, but big ups to @RodneyAnon for trying to get me to be social. I love you, man. What a weird night. Time for me to do more driving. ‚úäüèª https://t.co/APIsLDbQTW
@Numonic7 @RodneyAnon I go on at 8:45
@RodneyAnon I'm sitting here practicing all of my solo songs. It's been a couple years. I was having mini panic attacks in the car yesterday when I kept forgetting the lyrics to several songs. I think I finally have them all down pat again, so...I'm also very much looking forward to tonight!
@chefelf Eww? Or mmmm!
@zero42 @therealelp Ha. If you‚Äôre the one who said that to me, yes. It‚Äôs something that keeps repeating in my head. Get ready for that streaming gold.

@NoddyHari It‚Äôs the best place to purchase songs or albums unless an artist offers their own digital store. Which we do. But Bandcamp gives the fairest cut out of all the digital big boys.
That‚Äôs what I mean when I said that Napster kept people honest for the most part. If they truly felt the music, they‚Äôd find a way to support. These streaming services give people the impression they‚Äôre actually giving support but it‚Äôs...mere pennies. Heh https://t.co/JWK8tuG7fJ
@magenmelancholy Glad that they helped when they did. If you don't remember them, you've moved on from all of that. And that's a good thing. Forward we go!
@mornin_breath How dare they speak on my behalf!
@zetsuboubrizzle @oliverbookingco I think Napster was better. Kept people honest.
@sandman186 ‚ÄúAll.‚Äù Heh.
@fanslashstalker I do that.
@oliverbookingco I'd much rather go back to straight up piracy. Early Napster was the best Napster. ha

@oliverbookingco What's weird is I've actually encountered many facets of the industry (labels, promoters, venues) base their decisions on Spotify numbers. I may be exempt from that due to longstanding history, but it's a real thing.
@Nordlebash Thankfully I've lived in Scotland for a couple months. So I kinda get what you're saying. ha
@NotRightRuth I can‚Äôt bear to open the app. And I‚Äôm quite the bear.
@fanslashstalker Not when people are being more and more accustomed to the idea that streaming our music is actually ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù the artist. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm getting at.
@RandyAguebor I‚Äôm just trying to raise awareness that it doesn‚Äôt really help sustain a living for the artists you enjoy. And I despise promoting a company like that.
@Hoodie702 Thanks. I‚Äôm just trying to raise awareness that it doesn‚Äôt really help sustain a living for the artists you enjoy. And I despise promoting a company like that.
It chips away at my soul when I see fellow artists I respect and love trying to push their Spotify streams. Because I know that's where music is at these days and I know that it "matters." And I also know I'll probably have to relent at some point (maybe.) Still though...#NoCanDo
When you get to the end of your rope please tie a knot, hang on, and swing.  Unless you're a piece of shit.  In which case you should tie slipknot and do your thing.

@Dart_Adams The footage is from my camcorder which my girlfriend was operating. The camera was stolen from my trunk in Providence soon after that. Thankfully the people who stole it were nice enough to put the footage online. Can't say for sure who did what or when, but that's what happened.

@YoMyNamesJakeG @FunkerTactical @joerogan I really wanted to do this when I was in Los Angeles earlier this year before heading to Korea. Couldn't manage the traction. Hopefully we can do this at some point. JRE is the only podcast I listen to. Love his interviewing style and I feel I could play off of it well.
@marktstanton @weaeroplanes @FunkerTactical Always good to know how to strike and where to strike. I'm not dismissing that. But most of the time a weaker person will not be able to out-strike or out-muscle a stronger attacker, so they need to know the best survival options in the event that they're ever in this situation.
@marktstanton @weaeroplanes @FunkerTactical Can‚Äôt expect most women, children, or men to be ‚Äúsome of the best.‚Äù The main theme here is that people are not going to train in any discipline to the point they can appropriately dismantle an attacker stronger than them. Best to learn how to escape and run fast if nothing else.
@marktstanton @weaeroplanes @FunkerTactical It also includes a lot of ground game. Not necessarily the best place@to be when you‚Äôre a woman under attack, which is explained in the video I tweeted. But it is definitely the most interesting and chess-like fighting style.
@weaeroplanes @FunkerTactical I think it's important to know there are definite benefits to having children involved in whichever discipline they end up studying. But it's almost never about being able to truly defend oneself in a real life attack. It's dangerous for people/kids to think of it in that way.
There's a warning at the beginning of the video, but it's worth stating that there's some disturbing footage showing how women can be (and have been) attacked. I also want to big up @FunkerTactical for calling out an industry that capitalizes off of fear without being practical.
Something I almost never talk about, but I was involved in martial arts from age 8-22. Training, sparring, competing &amp; eventually teaching. There were things I was taught that I knew were not practical. Glad this guy is helping to dispel self-defense myths https://t.co/7I2XOT8z1A

@SNAFU85 The director straight up just bailed on the project. I've acquired all of the footage. Thousands of hours of footage. I'm not a video editor, but I bought a computer strictly for this purpose. I have no idea when I'll be able to get around to it, or if I even CAN, but I'll try.
It's been a long time since someone has mentioned this song, so thank you for this. I think about these kids pretty much every single day.

@JussSomeDude @j_typical I won't. And can't. And I'm more interested in just making the songs as fun and interesting as possible rather than doing anything else in regard to names/credits/props. Per their request.
@rubidubdubs Yes. It looks like we'll be there in April of 2009. @EpicBeardMen are expecting to bustaflow in Buffalo.
@jperson80 I've long been a pack rat so I have almost everything I've ever released or been featured on. Right up until a few years ago I guess. And recently I started just giving a lot of stuff away. But...yeah, of course I still have that vinyl.
@j_typical @DJPrincePaul I purposely didn't @ him. Since he's been @'ed, I just want to reiterate that he's 1 of the only producers I think I could vibe with on a full album. It wouldn't be commercially/legally viable (and who has the luxury for something like that in end times) but I'd still like to try
@TwinCitiesDan The EBM album will be followed by a solo album for sure. And they will be polar opposites in overall style. It's the only way.
@iowacold They're fat and happy. They keep me company and they keep me sane. I love them and I will be very sad when they're gone. So I do my best to spoil them with attention whenever they decide it's time for attention. heh.
@j_typical I'd love to do a full album with Prince Paul.
@shane3624 I won't be there. I have to see about a girl.
@SBmedo20 I respect the heck out of Stan Lee, but I was not into comics as a kid. I did read Spider Man comics on occasion, but I was mostly into the funnies. He lived a helluva life though. Not many people could claim to have as much influence on popular culture as he did.
@booksmartaskp Approach with care.
@TheRonnieRegan I don‚Äôt really have a favorite color. Because I‚Äôm not 8 years old. But the popular response is green.

I think the first show of the @EpicBeardMen USA tour in 2019 will be in Boston this April. Stay tuned &amp; sign up for the mailing list at https://t.co/qI6L2BFsNF
@SBmedo20 This happens all the time. More and more often. People who are close to me will quote a line of mine, and I'll know it's mine, but I can't quite place it. So I Google it. And that..........is super fucking weird. heh. But I also think it's good to just let go of some of that data
@Pink_And_Brown My most viewed movie from the 80s is "Ninja 3 The Domination"
@BiggameCB Ha. I can't find the exact vine but it's included in the "best of" montage (around the 12:03 mark): https://t.co/aA9i2ZP1gy
@NotoriousRED2 I did. There's a video of it on the innanets. I'm not proud of it. But people should be careful of how they interact with a guy on stage who's pouring his heart out while operating on energy reserves.
@OccultFan @adamcurry @THErealDVORAK Are you conflating "global warming" and climate change with...fucked up weather conditions that happen all over the world due to...climate change? Don't do that.
@appakz I guess I'm most proud of #CopperGone? Because I recorded it in my spare room, released it on my own, it launched me out of my stagnated state of depression into a full world tour, and charted on Billboard. But I can't really say I'm more proud of one album over another. Nah.
@aubreysund HARDLY. Only this year. And it's because some difficult and/or personal stuff got in the way of our overall tour plans. We'll be doing a full US tour in April after the @EpicBeardMen album drops in March.
@matzar12 That's an unfair question. I have a hair trigger tear ducts when watching films. The last one was probably Looper. And that's hardly a sad film. heh
@KillgoreMagz I show up in a lot of weird dreams. And my dreams have been too crazy to explain lately. So I wish we would all stay out of each other's dreams. I'm about to start a petition.
@cstone612 I've been thinking about it. I definitely believe the mutton chops will make a return at some point.
@Capt_Morgantown When the woman who asked me to play there a couple years ago responds to my email.
@dirtydubya Not really, no. No WWE for me. Not since the Ultimate Warrior came into the picture.
@stoik801 Not as much as I work for capitalism. Which I rather wouldn't. Yet, here we are.
@aubreysund haha I think of you Minneswotans often. Not sure how you guys stay so nice in such awful conditions.

@bigjimmurray We lost Bourdain but we still have Murray. For that we should be all thankful this holiday.
@mclassmartin @deadmilkmen @IrvingPlaza @EpicBeardMen @SFRupdates Yeah, it was in April. Enjoy yourself out there. I really enjoy Korea. Winters get very cold though
@mclassmartin @deadmilkmen @IrvingPlaza I actually played two shows in Korea this year. Sorry you missed them! https://t.co/RRDe28JHmP

@AntalFyra I've never had anyone ask me to weigh my hoodies. But...respeck. They're of different weights. This one's fabric is kind of thin rather than bulky. The pullover hoodies are all thicker. So, I'd assume they weigh more. Did I answer this correctly? I don't know what I'm doing.

@ChrisPummill @sammusmusic @Chazraps If so, my bad. Can you explain then? What I‚Äôm responding about is something I‚Äôve been dealing with for about 20 years, so it‚Äôs totally possible I‚Äôm stuck in the way I‚Äôve seen things and misunderstanding Sammus‚Äô situation. Pretty sure I understand though.
@sammusmusic @Chazraps That said, professionals know the boundaries. Those lines are deeply set in the sandbox. If these people are crossing those lines, it's almost always a bad sign. 99.9% of the time. I guess I'm just a snoop though. I'm always interested in knowing what's being proposed/accepted.
@sammusmusic @Chazraps I feel you. Not as a black woman obviously, but as someone who's often been the designated asshole when it comes to drawing lines. I just wanted to share a bit of advice I learned over the years. Because sometimes people end up needing to overlook the deals and/or book themselves
@sammusmusic @Chazraps With all due respect, you should want to be informed of who is pitching what. So it‚Äôs nice to stay informed as long as they aren‚Äôt expecting you to weigh in on the actual discussion. This will matter down the line. It‚Äôs def wise to establish those boundaries though. The biz sucks

@davepenishead @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs Oh right. And...why wouldn't he be promoting it at Scribble Jam? In 2002 I was promoting Personal Journals. Heh. But after more discussions about this photo I think we're settling on this being taken in 2004.
@PistolDave Why not just go with Pubey Pubis and the Pubes. Go all the way. Like...really commit to the shitty joke, Dave.
@TimChamberlain @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs Excuse me??? I used the "first name" code. A code very few people would be able to crack in order to figure out who I was referencing outside of rappers in our high fame circuit. So...what is your name and who do you work for?
@squilax_mcg I'm just happy that I now know the term to use when I encounter this bullshit. So thank you for hipping me to it.
@squilax_mcg Holy crap. It even has its own Wikipedia page.
@SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs Well, according to the texts I've received from Sean, this photo was most likely taken in 2004. Fuck do I know? The early 2000's is just one big year.
@squilax_mcg Huh. What is sealioning?
@SarahDunsworth @MHKHogs Not gonna lie. I think about the backstory of the guy who sang that often. I don‚Äôt want to Google anything about him or know the truth. I feel I‚Äôve built up his story too much in my head to risk being disappointed.
@SarahDunsworth Hahaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!  Welcome back...to my hell.
#ProTip for singers/vocalists: Every time you hit the studio, channel the guy who sang the Gummi Bears theme song. Go beast mode and act like it's your very last chance of being recognized as the incredible vocal talent that you are. EVERY...SINGLE...TIME. https://t.co/SyOPyYzXUH
@SFRupdates @casOne1 @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs This may be true. But if I ever see a velvet, I'll crush it 10 out of 10 times. #Buhleedat
@davepenishead @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs It was 2001.
@davepenishead @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs No, I wasn't there in 2002.
@type1superstar @brentlmiller @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs Haha. I was like, "Ah great, now it looks like I'm suggesting he should kill someone and then this collab will go down." It is 2018 afterall.
@minuetbynight It‚Äôs almost like you didn‚Äôt read the first part.
@brentlmiller @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs Wait, just to be clear, I'm not being suggestive.
@brentlmiller @SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs People have surely killed for less.
@SFRupdates @atmosphere @therealelp @runjewels @MrDibbs Pretty sure this was 2001. But I had a big beard during the battle in 2001, so maybe it was 2000? But I also could have shaved the beard after the battle, so 2001? Whatever the case, I'm wearing corduroys and not crushed velvet pants like a lot of people on IG were pointing out.
#EvergreenTweet https://t.co/igXQRefYB2
@Glasgow_Bear1 @WildCabaret @JaneyGodley @redmondmichael1 @TonyFibbers Yeah, but it‚Äôs the shitty half.
@jsmooth995 @SOBs The music community at large (not just the hip-hop community) has been incredibly quiet about his fucked upness. I appreciate you speaking out about Bambaataa.
@flawlesslogik You are replying to me, the person who released that album. Just saying. Ha. That wasn‚Äôt a tweet to the general population or your followers. But you‚Äôre right.
@_Flawed_Logic Oh man. @Metermaids emailed me the same quote today when I suggested that I probably can‚Äôt release the song that I sent him. Shaming me into feeling obligated to include it on the album now.
How's come I had a viral tweet &amp; no one told me? heh. I swear I check my mentions.

@CalmDownFrancis I don't know what that means. Can you explain that? Because not only do I wear an actual cape, but I've worn a "chin cape" for a very long time. We're not considering "A Cape Rarely Appears On Your Chin" as an @EpicBeardMen album title now. You will not be given credit for it. TY
@JayTheZilla I've yet to find a dress I feel comfortable in. But I'm not giving up.
Not only did I VOTE, but I followed that grand civic duty by visiting YouTube and Reddit to downvote everything I don't like. Not all heroes wear capes...but I do.
@Spacedustx It‚Äôs stacked with many recommended books that I hope to read one day.
@tjland99 I feel like it‚Äôs a good time for a trade. If there are actually any teams interested in paying for a ‚ÄúMAYBE he‚Äôs more clutch than he is a random poopy pants goalie.‚Äù He still has a relatively good reputation. That interest could die out quickly if he letting in soft goals this yr
@Angusbeats There's no reason he shouldn't be playing right now. Not until he shows a misstep and then Rask can step back in.

@realAdamWalder @SFRupdates @universityofri That is what we, back in the day, called a "NY freestyle."  Also, that's the black sweatshirt I dedicated a song to on my Personal Journals album.
@Bushwood_C_C Same thing when the NES first came out. The first kid in town who had Nintendo suddenly had a house packed with kids itching to get their hands on the controller. ha. FINALLY we weren't wasting quarters at the arcade.
@cars_and_trains Ha!!! I had that too. Photon sucked. You had to literally shoot into the other gun. And it was very easy to block.
@BenCarelle There have been offers. It'll never happen. Unless a camera can be crammed into my head, it would mostly be a very disappointing viewing experience.
#TBT It‚Äôs a beautiful day for Fall cleaning. I discovered the OG #LazerTag guns in my attic. I don‚Äôt imagine they let kids run around school with these anymore, but I can remember some exhilarating recess battles. https://t.co/gSEuVP1GJs https://t.co/ZTQ0CQ4ZUI
Upon waking up, I realized I mistakenly repeated an incorrect phrase during the chorus so I had to go back and do it all over again. 10/10 would bang again. Thanks for the support, everyone. üî•üíúüî•
@ScottSagan "Eating away" as in...literally eating away at my flesh. Everyone's all like, "Congrats on the weight loss!" If they only knew though. I'm just trying to raise awareness for a flesh eating disease that manifest itself in the form of words that need to be clearly spoken into a mic
@LiPurposeFe No. "Waterline" didn't do that to me. But it does hit very sensitive buttons in a short timeframe.
@jeremyhigfx Nah. Makeshift Patriot was more about fear, anger, disgust, and...it was very calculated in its execution. Not nearly as visceral of a song as it was a necessary attempt to mark a difficult moment of history in as clear and succinct way as possible.
Tonight was the 3rd time in my recording career where I had to walk away from the recording booth &amp; have a meltdown after my 1st vocal take due to lyrics that've been eating away at me for too long. And I know that's a good sign of sorts, but also..."I'm getting too old for this"

@Grhymz1 Would love to never give my opinion on your songs.
@69Health You're an old follower of my deleted Vines I see.  I LIKE IT.
@Boycey_83 Ha. I'm not sure how you know I did a song with Kool G Rap as it was never released. Maybe I tweeted about it at some point? I have no idea what happened to that song, but since it wasn't released I ended up using the lyrics I wrote for it on this song: https://t.co/xKJFigXtfw

@Ant1Her0Project Yeah, it's cute how my name isn't really included in the title or credits as a feature. Or how they've long used random people to perform my part of the song on stage, but never asked me. It's all part in parcel to the full story.
@oliverbookingco I haven't yet. The PO Box hasn't been plunged. But I'll have you know that I've thought about it every day since you emailed me. And, no, Halloween season does not end tomorrow. It ends on January 1st for me. I will send you guys something as well. Much love to you &amp; the gangsta.
@XtianStroud @TimMaryPrinz23 The @EpicBeardMen"Season 1" release was just an EP (although the extended version was 12 songs...ha.) FREE. The official album will drop in March 2019, and it's a doozy. We will tour it from April until the wheels fall off of our van. For the uninitiated: https://t.co/iwg61RmQJO
@kbride420 Cabin in the Woods might be my favorite horror movie. Either that or The Last Temptation of Christ.
@Ant1Her0Project It was funny. I mean...hopefully someone asks me this question on a podcast so I can tell the full story. The full humor can't be communicated well in a tweet.
@FretCannon I haven't gotten hitched in the legal sense, but I'm totally locked in. She's a hell of a cook so I'm eating more than I was before we were together. We'll see how all of that pans out in the fat department of ol' Paulie. I need to keep exercising my bread and sugar discipline.
@TimMaryPrinz23 I'm leaning strongly toward the idea of putting together one final "Sick of" mixtape. I've long expected to put together another DVD. However, there's so much video footage to sift through, I may just start releasing stuff on the @SFRupdates YouTube channel or start a new one.
@undabawse There aren't many artists I'm itching to perform with outside of my immediate circle of strange cohorts, but I'm playing with @thedeadmilkmen at @IrvingPlaza in NYC on Dec 15th and that is most definitely a bucket list item. https://t.co/aqTMJex340
@newlyfast @therealelp I‚Äôve long hoped to do a song with him, and we were in discussions about it for a little while, but it‚Äôs possible that ship has sailed. I‚Äôm always open to it though.
@chadmath I‚Äôve never pooped in a shoe. I‚Äôm not even sure I have the aim that something like that would require.
@PecheyYellow I do not miss battling. The main reason I entered the Scribble Jam in 2000 as a character (‚ÄúXaul Zan‚Äù) is because I really wasn‚Äôt invested in the whole battle thing. I still have a lot of battle left in me, but that energy is best to be used in other ways.
@phandomvillains Absolutely. The UK has always been one of the most welcoming tour spots for me, and Bristol never disappoints. Expect the @EpicBeardMen to make a stop there next year.
I've been relatively quiet on social media lately. Rest assured...the wordy words, lovey love, hatey hate, and everything else are being funneled into enough songs to occupy more than a couple albums. But it's almost 6AM, so maybe we can make this an early morning #AskMeAnything?
@alaska_ATOMS Love it. And so glad it was him to close it out.

@signsovthetimes @selfdfens Not saying that no one ever turned on me, but it wasn't done en masse and it happened over the course of 20 years. Still happening, still expected, still glad I didn't come up in a scene where some of these rapper's careers literally DO last one week.
@rhythmicalexile @jsmooth995 Conversely, Chuck D helped me look at name brand clothes and corporations with a critical eye. Ha.

@TheRonnieRegan Here's Ronnie...asking the big questions.
8yrs ago I woke up in western Canada to voicemails about my Dad passing away unexpectedly. I flew home to see him wearing a Red Sox jersey with a couple bottles of beer stashed in his casket. I was like, "huh, wish I was included in the decision making here. But....nice." #RedSox
@rhythmicalexile @jsmooth995 Run DMC peaked hard and did their thing. I mean no disrespect to them. I am a huge, huge, huge fan due to the music and influence they provided me in my younger years. But it's nothing like what Public Enemy provided in the long run. Not by a long shot.
@jsmooth995 I‚Äôd file this under ‚Äúhumble deprecation.‚Äù Run DMC does not match the ‚Äúcoolness,‚Äù impact, or longevity of Public Enemy.
@Thegambone I look good enough to be a treat as I'm covering the faces of people around me. THAT'S THE TRICK. But thank you. Ah looks how ah feel. Sometimes.

@petmis Haha. So..........just to be clear.......the answer I was looking for regarding the price you quoted about the hoodie included shipping. It wasn't "plus shipping." And, no, I'm not going to Halifax. Sorry. Come to RI and pick up the hoodie. No shipping costs at all if you do that
@petmis Like I said...do you mean "including shipping" or "plus shipping"? Because we are not in control of shipping rates. We do our best to keep our prices very low considering the cost of shipping.

Here's one of the more "political" type songs I've done recently for @Aupheus' album: https://t.co/If8tbrD2h3 And the @FreeLeeReed album we just released on @SFRupdates says it all https://t.co/V3XwEEsw3r
@deandelray Send me a preview if you can, because it's totally possible I gave you incorrect info on when stuff would be released. Ha. It's been a while since that discussion and much has changed since then. For instance, the @EpicBeardMen album drops in March 2019 instead of this month. üôè
@bigbullybusick @gooseohio @SFRupdates And *I* said IT'S YUMMY.
@gooseohio @SFRupdates They‚Äôre fans. I had a meet and greet there when they first opened. Chicago...I miss it. I‚Äôll be back.

@AWOLONE Excited to be part of it! Turn up the Rakim frequencies on my vocal track pls. üôèüèª

@JoshuaLegere Hahaa you need to hop on the New England sports stock market while things are hot. Drop those stocks next year though.
@SinsHere89 @freeleereed My Journalism Professor shows "The Network" movie in one of our classes. As if we were in grade school. Ha. But that movie is fucking great and highly relevant.
@ToastWRPI @MrChuckD Yeah. The crowd started leaving so @FlavorFlav had to come back out on stage to explain the show wasn‚Äôt over yet. So many insane things happened at that show. The lineup was incredible. So...many...classic...artists. And then there was Oaktown 357.

@lunchbox651 My narrative here is all off. For bad comedy‚Äôs sake. She‚Äôs the one who insisted we fire up the ol‚Äô Nintendo machine and knock Bowser out the box. Took about an hour for all my muscle memory to return to my thumbs, but once that happened it was on...like Donkey Kong.
But then...the princess saves herself!  #PLOTTWIST  Love is dumb. I love it. https://t.co/FD4IeyPW40
When you break out the OG #NES to play a little Super Mario Bros and you explain to your partner how important it is to save the princess...which is why you're in such deep concentration. But she's like, "Ha. Cute. Maybe turn off the Nintendo now so we can not do this ever again" https://t.co/4TL5aXrCDq
@Locusta_TV It's a different situation of indie artists and small businesses. But I do agree with you.
@mcsole What I find odd is how they throttle the hell out of links to Instagram posts on Facebook. Considering FB owns IG.

To this day, to me, this is the best song about a sports team. It's by a New Englander who inherited a loyalty to the J-E-T-S:  https://t.co/ZKKb5SFHze Poor sumbich. As weird as it is, I tear up when I listen to this from start to end. Love you, @Prolyphic. Loyalty is royalty. üíØ
@UselessTopLaner Feels pretty inevitable.
@TheGerk2 I‚Äôm not super confident in a NE win tomorrow, but I‚Äôll take you up on that.
@Ace_Jameson They're going to be back from China tomorrow?
@revolutionaryaf Win or lose, it's what I'm looking forward to. It'll give a good indication of truly how far the Pats will go this season. There won't be a lot of tough(er) matchups this season. And I'm just happy I get to veg out and watch the games in my own home this year. Been a long time.
@bosox_mitch At this point, yeah. Pretty meaningless. Ha. Until the playoffs.
Yes, I *will* waste an entire Saturday watching a totally meaningless Red Sox game on mute while listening to rap songs made by my friends as I get increasingly more impatient about being able to watch a Patriots game tomorrow. Yes, I am New England basic. Yes, it's OK to hate me
@john_stone_john @_mcchris I'm 41. I wouldn't have guessed in a million years that Chris wasn't any older than maybe 33? I guess I never thought about it. But that was a "wow" moment for me. Glad to know more of the older heads are soldiering on and making it work.

@jd_twist I survived. It's just wild how much I pay to #BlueCross and how often they screw me over with costs and accessibility.
@DarkJay_ @noyokono Haha. Well, shit...if that LP didn't leak four months before its actual release, maybe I wouldn't have gotten such an underwhelming response when it finally dropped. Those were the days though. Delivering an album to media 4 months prior to an album release. Sure don't miss that.
@albelarson I‚Äôm capable of doing more than one thing at the same time. Unlike those dang plebs! ü§ñ
@rzatexans Him too.
@eldeniro90 And uhhhhh....you referenced someone who literally has nothing original to offer while implying that Eminem is ripping her off. I don't want to imply that Eminem has literally nothing original to offer. There's a chasm between his career/origin and her own.
@AdamBrightPhoto I've already given a few examples. I won't state the newest examples, because I personally don't have any kind of love for the people he's ripping off. So...good on him! Ha. Also, I won't turn this thread into a novel. That's not how I should be spending my first day back home.
@eldeniro90 In this instance he's simply mimicking the popular style of the time. Which is very common, predictable, and I'm sure you could find a thousand other examples of this exact flow.
@BristlePad @Hoodie702 @Cagewm And the crowd goes, "OOOooooooooohhhhhhhh!!!"  Heh. This may have been one of the only times he didn't punch down. He punched parallel (or maybe on a slightly upward angle,) and it's probably one of the most unimpressive "shots fired" lyrics in the history of battle punchlines.
This may sound like a "shot." I guess it is in a way. But in all actuality I'm doing my best to explain that he is so talented at adopting styles, I don't think he's ever been able to settle into a style of his own. Casual fans of hip-hop would never recognize styles he exploits.
@TimMaryPrinz23 I mean, it's a no win situation. He's not going to respond. And you just end up looking like a "hater." I clearly stated that I wasn't implying that he bites my shit, and I hardly have a horse in this race, yet I'm still dealing with people thinking this is a ploy for attention.
@fredegrar That's not exactly what I'm getting at, and that's very big of him, but he is needlessly snatching away Vanilla Ice's claim on that front. heh.
@ChickenDevon Some are impeccable impressionists. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@ChickenDevon Haha I am absolutely SURE of it. But it's not me.
@ittechpros_15 @Cagewm I mean, that was one era. Along with the eras where he was channeling AZ, Masta Ace, and many others. But that's not this era.
Wanna know who Eminem wouldn‚Äôt dare take shots at? The lesser known rappers who‚Äôve put a fire under his ass. I am not implying I am one of them. I am asserting that he‚Äôs technically proficient at jacking styles and, so talented in fact, he may have never had a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of his own.

@SkobieWon Ha. It absolutely depends on the food they're being applied to. But I loves me some true mustard with the seeds. Spicy and all.
@RobBraunFrom85 Chicago.
@dean8669 Yeah. He's at his home in Canada, he continues to host a nationally syndicated radio show, and he plays a lot of baseball. He's out of the music and social media game. Can't blame him. Still...wish he was active in the music world. He's an incredible talent.
@parliamentn1 Ever seen someone after they died from having all of their capillaries burst to the point where blood came out of every orifice of their body? I guess that's what started the whole concept of the song.
@julius_orange I am a Red Sox fan. I never cared all that much about the Paw Sox, but I guess I did have a bit of an attachment to them. The original @SFRupdates office was right down the road from their stadium actually. Kinda stinks to not have a RI connection to the Red Sox now. #FinalAnswer
@RealSlimGabey Absolutely not. I do not watch college sports. I don't even like that it's an "industry" in that kind of way. But maybe I'd change my mind if I had a sliver more of free time.
@DREADNOK I don't fuck with Dune. So I guess it's Star Wars. But I don't really have any great affinity toward Star Wars. I mostly fucks with old school Star Trek if that's the path we're going down.
@ThomasDukeman Heh. Well, I guess I don't really agree with the premise of your question so I'm not able to answer it. As for how I fit in, I'm just grateful to have found any type of audience who can relate to what I'm talking about and appreciate it.
@aubreysund Great question, but...tough to get into. Lots of bad interactions to sift through over the years. The interactions are 98% positive, but that 2% really bring their own bullshit into the equation and I have to confront it as best as possible. I don't always do the best with it.
@BiggameCB "Make Em Purr" and "Once Upon A Blood Moon" were the most difficult songs to record when it came to actually saying the words and revisiting the memories. And that's not even to say that those were the most cutting songs. That's just how it worked out in that time of my life.
@arfjets80 A guy proposing to her girlfriend, her running away in tears like "nahhhhhhh," and all of us standing there like...........eeeek. That's one of them I guess. Another was when a girl literally tried kicking me in the balls for having her tweaked out friend kicked out of the club.
@xaanzmasque I'd like to know what you think I should tackle.  I've long wanted to tackle the Orpheus story and turn it into a full album.  Getting close to figuring out how to do that.  Not sure if this answer fits the criteria of your question though.
@lynsey_mack Great question. I'll quote one of the worst demo songs that were ever sent to me and say, "I'm not the best but I'm not the worst."
@Impius My weirdest hotel story is probably not even left in any corner of my memory banks. But I do remember staying in one of the worst hotels in Canada. I took a shower after the show and then realized there were no towels. Nor was there a phone to call the front desk. I made due.
@BuzzBot235 Ya know...I have no choice but to assume they're doing well. I haven't received any updates on them since I left. But whenever I return home they get super snuggly so I'm hoping it's the same thing this time around.
@gijoepesci I have not. I haven't seen much outside of looking out the car window and into crowds from the stage. Sad to say this, but, "people watching" isn't incredibly interesting in the UK.
@DJYwrites She sent me the beat &amp; I recorded to it. I remember touring with her in Oz &amp; taking her on tour with me in the US. Tried signing her to @SFRupdates. She ended up signing w/ @subpop. No bad feelings about that. She's super talented and I wish her the best with everything she does.
@BeamCarpenters When he popped off I was super busy with my own stuff so I never really got to hear his music outside of his big hit. And it was the one with the beat that used the same sample as the Scenario remix, which I always loved. And he took some L's. And he's an emotional dude. I get it
@Hoodie702 It's not a Cage album, is it? I mean...that's like conflating a "Xaul Zan" album with a "Sage Francis" album. Artists wear different hats for different reasons. I haven't had the chance to check it out yet. Minimal access to WiFi here in the good ol' UK. I listen to Sports Talk.
Real talk though... I shed some tears at the end of tonight's show. You see smiles on stage &amp; in the pics, but we're going through our respective shitty shit. The performances occupy 1.5 hrs per day, &amp; we're incredibly grateful for the opportunity to smile like that. So thank you https://t.co/bbjkm1kvEq

Dear writers, Try writing something without the word ‚Äúheart‚Äù in it.  #ThisIsNotASubtweet
@ThorenHoneycutt That‚Äôs pretty much where I‚Äôm at. It‚Äôs tough to break old habits. Sure is nice to smile confidently though. Not sure why this is one of the main superficial aspects of my life, but I‚Äôm just owning up to my the fact that it is. We should smile regardless of the teeth. Smiles rule.
@xaanzmasque @EpicBeardMen Shout out to @seezmics for hipping me to his material. Daniel Quinn actually gets a shoutout on a song we did together which will be released on Seez Mics' upcoming album on #SFfigi @SFRupdates.
@xaanzmasque @EpicBeardMen Yes, I have. Enjoyable. Important stuff in there.
"By the end of the night we‚Äôre left feeling revitalised and ready to tear down the system" As half of the @EpicBeardMen, confidently speaking for the other half on this matter, it's great that that's the feeling that was left in our wake.

@Bigchie51161598 No. No, sir. I respectfully let the debate end with her not understanding why cats are the best. But I thought it was a funny to envision it turning into an all out street riot between the beards and her crew. I don't want to risk my potential Sainsbury's sponsorship right now.
Woman at my show saw me leaving a store. She pointed at a dog, ‚Äúhow cute is that?‚Äù I said, ‚Äúvery cute.‚Äù She said, ‚Äúdogs are much better than cats.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI grew up with dogs, I love both.‚Äù ‚ÄúNah, but, dogs are way better,‚Äù she said.

@NothingsReally @EpicBeardMen @SFRupdates @BDolanSFR Not gonna lie........I thought the same thing. But who knows how many albums we have left in us considering the lifespan of rappers these days?
@Dystyntmysfyt Never cared to be a "political rapper." But sometimes that shit happens when you know what needs to be said &amp; no one else is saying it in the right way. If that's what you're mostly interested in, there's a strong back catalog of songs with political commentary that still hold up
@MarkCom1313 Minor Threat...forevz obvz. Haha. But what I like most about the title, without any punctuation on the end, is it can be read and interpreted in a several ways. One of them being how it's used at the end of the lyrics.
Currently juggling a slew of potential titles for our #EpicBeardMen album which is going to drop in March, 2019. I‚Äôm partial to ‚ÄúWTF Have You Done‚Äù at the moment.

I talked to my Dr who talked to my pharmacist who told me to talk to Blue Cross so I did &amp; I talked to my pharmacist again who told me to talk to my Dr which I did &amp; then the pharmacist talked to Blue Cross &amp; it's been determined I'll be sans blood pressure meds + commas on tour.
@SarahJenea @jenduncan333 I'm sorry to hear about this. I know you're feeling the feels extra hard on this day. Much love to you.
Working on my swan song. I‚Äôm a method rapper. https://t.co/EFKrHYjFad
Thanks for keeping it easy on me for the most part in the last couple of hours. My unprovoked and unanticipated AMA is officially OVER. One day I'll give more of a heads up on when these things actually happen. https://t.co/qI6L2BFsNF
@Omeganightmare I cook my home made meals. I guess my favorite one is like......some type of low-grade professional ramen soup.
@AlexisErudite I take everything with boulder-sized grains of salt. If that makes any type of sense. And it probably doesn't.
@operant_Chamber The lack of humidity. That's about it.
@SilentTheFox That‚Äôs such a good question because I can mostly remember the songs that gave me the most difficult time to record. My favorite is a song called #YouCantTellMeShit which will be on the @EpicBeardMen album. If it before the release just for the heck of it.
@Hoss_Delgado_ All of my merch, including the obscure "Sick of" mixtapes are here: https://t.co/wEgJIIC63J
@beaniebaby0123 If I did it'd probably have been removed. I do know it came out years ago, I was never asked for permission, but I do enjoy the mashup and the attention it received. Most of the time the only thing I request when this stuff happens is a link to my website: https://t.co/qI6L2BFsNF
@Grassnasty I don't do favorites.
@DexterFrunts To be quite honest, the cliche phrase "go out on a limb" is what inspired me to just riff on the concept. And it branched off in several ways from there. BRANCHED OFF! Heh.........ugh (sorry) https://t.co/zqI1Ftj7uh
@LOLwithTara I've never been happy overall. Not most of the time. That just hasn't seemed to be what's most important. Happiness isn't the goal. I certainly appreciate happiness though. And fuck the alternatives.
@bourgeoismoose Intrigued and conflicted.
@Chazraps That's a great question because there's no real answer for it. Most of the time I wait until the very last moment to just pick something that I think dresses up the album's body in a cute way. Or awful way. Or fun way. But sometimes I have a cover idea before the album's recorded
@ekohmusic If you can't grow a beard on the outside, grow one on the inside. That's the one that matters. Groom it, stroke it, and only let the people who deserve to appreciate it experience it.
@wusta I'll assume you're asking me about the three albums in general out of all genres. Which is a very difficult question to answer and one I'm not well equipped to answer considering how I don't listen to a shit-ton of music. But here I go: 1) I have no fucking idea. haha. I'm sorry.
@lujan_matthew4 Yes, I have to approve "Sea Lion" any place where it's used for licensing purposes. So do the other contributors of the song. Now that Alias has passed, I'm not totally sure how this all works out. But I'll license it on anything if it means his family gets funding at this point.
@drdria How does it look? It's a constant guessing game for me. Maybe I do great at it. Maybe I do awful. I try to be balance the "professional" with the "passionate," but it's quite possible they're canceling each other out.
@notyou_again I can still play poker. I'm always down. But I won't go out of my way to find a game or waste a night at a casino at this point. I will say though...it was a fun way to socialize with people who have no idea who I am. But sometimes they did. So my trolling approach would go stale
Streaming is just...reality. I have no great opinion one way or another about it. It's what the masses do. My campaign to make streamers realize that they need to support in more significant ways if they love an artist makes me come across as an "out of touch" DB to the DB masses https://t.co/0Aodc6MpSV
@FledLast My two favorite authors for quite a while have been Tom Robbins and Kurt Vonnegut.
@xShawnThomas The real question you should ask is, "How difficult is it to get you to talk about really stupid things?" The answer is...not hard at all. But I probably wouldn't take much time out of my day to do that for a random podcast. You'd have to catch me in line at the post office.
@BrainWeighty When you send me their pictures. Every Saturday. From now until they turn into sloth monsters.
@jonochapman82 I see about one movie per year in the movie theater. Maybe that'll change if I become officially domesticated. Tough call. But I don't care one way or another about that.
@Hoodie702 When an artist is done their experiment and it proves that it works, they'll know how to submit the info. This is the "Escape Room" of the indie music industrial complex.

I've felt hogtied about what I can post about online recently. Hit me with questions &amp; I'll do my best to answer in the most official and/or ambiguous way before 10pm EST.

@petmis Outside of what I released as part of @EpicBeardMen (https://t.co/iwg61RmQJO,) we‚Äôll be releasing much more music by March of 2019. After that, maybe more solo stuff sooner than later.

@CRYPTOK1RK @CryptoMedra @fuck_plebs @RealShillGates Ewwww........gross.
@GamingDespair Oh, is that all? Well, I wish you the best with that. I don't know you personally and I'm not in the best position to offer something like that. Bless allllllllll the way up though.
@GamingDespair I'm far from the kind of person who could offer help in real time if this is life or death. But if you're in some kind of F'ed up state, I totally understand. If your life is at stake, or it's self-harm related, this is the number to call: 1-800-273-8255. Ain't no crime to use it
Shout out to anyone I've ever been with From forever ago until recently Thank you for giving it a shot Sorry for being difficult to figure out And, no, I won't respond to texts And, no, these songs aren't about u  But, yes, you're a part of the whole And I'm trying to be complete

@jcranf hahaaaaa what the....
At my nephew‚Äôs bday party him &amp; his friends commented on how 1 of the little girls at the table had a much bigger slice of pizza than them. I said, ‚ÄúIt only looks big because she‚Äôs so small. And THAT...is perspective, kids.‚Äù They were like ‚Äúhuh, OK.‚Äù But yo, her slice was mad big
@SirHeadphones Someone who pays for a vanity plate deserves less purring than those who don‚Äôt pay for such BS. But I appreciate you sharing that

I don't even like the *old* Kanye. So to hell with any of y'all who are on the fence about my celebration of his most recent bullshittery.

A Norwegian rapper named Trong Wiger covered my #MakeEmPurr song. He absolutely nailed it. A limited number of 7" copies have been pressed to vinyl and we have 20 signed by me at @SFRupdates. It also includes my OG version of the song. All other info here: https://t.co/6m3iXMFmSV https://t.co/At9GWECchm
@Jeff_Dub @SFRupdates It's a @Shopify issue and should be handled soon. Beyond our control at the moment. They're who we use for our online sale transactions.
@Jeff_Dub Thanks for giving the heads up. I've shot the info over to @SFRupdates
@Jeff_Dub You deleted the tweet about the SFRstore issue. Just wondering if you've discovered the reason it happened.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs  #InternationalCatDay2018 and Uncle Sage still hasn‚Äôt posted anything about it yet. No #MakeEmPurr video? No cat Vines?‚Äù  Nah, fam. I‚Äôm beyond that. To hell and back...and now I *am* a cat.  https://t.co/fxaTNkEVmY https://t.co/2vPZ8dEpAp

@noyokono Watch how I work it. I do good things with this type of stuff.
Someone recently took the the stand in court &amp; called me a "rapper" as if that was a disparaging thang. As if that made me a less than desirable human. Sadly, I didn‚Äôt get the chance to stand up and say, ‚ÄúObjection, you‚Äôre Honor‚Ä¶I‚Äôm an EMCEE!‚Äù Which would have been very hip-hop.
@CCoffeeBlack @EpicBeardMen I love seeing a response like that. Especially after someone called me a "cuck" for attempting to help raise children who aren't my own blood. I mean...I was raised by someone who was not of my blood. He's no longer here for me to share this info with to havre a laugh over. So &lt;3
@tjland99 @EpicBeardMen NOW I WANT 3K!  300K!

@ArsGratiaArtiss Well, that's a wide range of styles so I wouldn't know where to start. One album you haven't mentioned that seems to be a fan favorite is Personal Journals, but pretty much every official album is listed and streaming here: https://t.co/QIOgprZJdj
@GeoffTrenchard @EpicBeardMen You helped. Thank you for that.
@_davidma Nah...just the Forthright.
@Audsferatu @EpicBeardMen Totally understand. And I'm sorry to hear it. But also happy to hear about the growth. That's the way.
@Audsferatu @EpicBeardMen Considering the realms of hell we've had to maneuver through to experience a bit of heaven, and the range of moods we've had to go through lately, it's only fair if all our hearts explode at once. Right, right? haha. xoxoxo
Oh heck, just 1 more...promise. My grandma gave me her engagement ring while I was in Florida. I anxiously toured through North America, Hawaii, Korea, and then back home with it. I did not lose it.

@MichaelParente @ThatDaveBrown @sofascout1 @defnotGG Didja?
@CrystalPepsi @DirectingTitan @MurderBryan That shit is way too funny to me. Still though.......really feelin' those lighters.
@SilentTheFox OMG..........EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE FAVORITE COLOR OF A GENIUS IS GREEN!
@ErikBjornNelson The music business has changed in drastic ways since the 80s...since the 90s...since the 2000s...since now. That's an impossible question to answer without doing a full Ted Talk. Wuddup, @TEDTalks?!
@SilentTheFox I don't have answers to those questions because I'm not 12 years old. Hahhaa. I mean......NO DISRESPECK!
@Frank_Yourself I do, yeah. Because I've long given up on that practice and it takes a lot of fucking work.
@tunnelofsludge The answer to that question relies on the era you're referencing. But really, at this point, piracy is the norm (even via streaming, which is the norm,) so it makes no difference what I think. I'd just like to make a living off of the art I dedicate my life to.
@DrMacDougall Maybe we just call out people, artists, and twitter accounts for saying things that mean absolutely nothing. It's a start? Heh. I have no idea.
@Goldfish855 Haha. I mean, I am not a person who goes out to bars. But maybe I'll use this opportunity to give a special shoutout to Lindy's Tavern.
@weaeroplanes What are acronym shows?
@techmobowlhigh5 I'm hopefully brushing my teeth and going to bed so I can wake up very early for a semi-long drive to a court room. More than likely I'll be staying up later than that, but I'm doing my best to knock myself out.
@JussSomeDude Nah. I listened. They‚Äôre one of my favorite hip-hop groups ever.
@IrishBrian420 Heh. Uhhhhhhhh. Goooooood luck? I have no idea at this point.
@brentlmiller Yes. 20 years in the making.
@onesmartninja I don‚Äôt do favorites.
@SBmedo20 Bob Dylan most likely has no idea who I am or what I do or how I relate to several levels of his life/career. And at a certain point, that may have bothered me. At this point, it would bother me if anyone else was bothered by me not giving them the same recognition. Means nothing
@BuzzBot235 No, I have it in my garage and I stare at it about once a week like, "One day..........we'll do this."
@Sernett Tuesday. The @EpicBeardMen video for #DIYMFS https://t.co/s00lBjsS23
@OldManCount I don't do favorites.
@JussSomeDude Yeah. Once.  Just like........everyone else.
@TheRealJonDub @boburnham I understand his self-hatred. That's about all I can say about that. I have no other opinion.
@MmYummyBeets I can't say I remember that much at all. But I can't imagine I would have performed before them without saying something that may have offended them or their fans. I mean...I know that for sure.
@MxDEJ I've long enjoyed the perfect balance between strange and famous. It's possible that will change, but I'm appreciative of how long I've enjoyed that balance.
@Chazraps This would take me a long time to figure out, but my "Y'all so stupid like a van full of Pakistans at a Klan rally" on the HOPE album is probably one of the most obscure references. I know there are more obscure references though.
@citizen_snips19 Glad you like it. It would be really nice if Bad Religion listed me as the feature. I think I'll do a "feature-cast" type mix that will show all the features I've done that most people have no idea about. I don't do favorites.
@Chazraps It wasn't in 2005. They approached me while I was setting up my merch at Scribble Jam in 2004. If they were willing to show the full interview (and not just the dumb/fun freestyle,) I'd give this more attention. But nah. Fuck them. Fuck Peta. Not down widdit.
@matzar12 I like spicy pickles.
@pun_guyz I've heard about venmo but I don't really know what it is.  Is it a payment app?  My paypal app is connected to strangefamousrecords@gmail.com Otherwise, just slip me a fiver at the next show and be like, "this is for all the music you've made that I enjoy. $5 should be enough."
@ChemistryMC I can't do that and I don't do favorites. It's not my thing. Sorry.
@crazyoverlord I don't know what prom you're speaking of, I don't know who you are or where u live, I don't know what going to the prom would entail but I'm honored as heck that you'd invite me. I've never had a good prom experience though. I hope you do. If you don't, trust me...it gets bettah
@ObeseGhostKids I could never, ever, everrrrr answer this in a tweet. Not even an interview. It would take a full podcast. Hopefully I can delve into this completely in a podcast I've long been hoping to bust out.
@TheHeckk MacGruber.
@rhythmicalexile No. Because I'm old.
@AngryObie No. Because I'm old.
@notyou_again That spoken word tour was part of a very short tour where I had someone filming the shows who ended up being very reluctant in helping me use the footage. So...my distrust in videographers multiplied by my lack of opportunity in doing spoken word tours makes me feel like...nah?
@JJones2014 Buck 65 has convinced himself that he won't be involved with music anymore. However, as a lifelong Music Mafia member, I have a hard time accepting that. Especially considering how creative, talented, and incredible he is.
@wesfau2 I had to explicitly explain to her that I was in no way interested in dying. That's kind of what made me tweet about this in the first place. But what you're referencing is a lyric from #MakeEmPurr which was another Doctor who was very concerned about my physical health. Yayy. ha
@Brad_Ganley I don't follow channels. But last night I returned to one of my favorite YT videos ever. It's so wrong...but it's so right. https://t.co/xOjCG0KAPl
I know a small percentage of my followers actually see my tweets on a regular basis, and even less of y'all are on Twitter for the next hour, but I'll be awake for the next hour.

@ba3toven Ya know, I had a therapist as a child. I don't think therapy was as helpful as it could have been if I wasn't totally following everything that was happening. Can't come to any great breakthroughs or revelations while in a state like that. It's kinda tedious. Maybe I'll try again
@SBmedo20 #CopperGone is something I hope to never replicate. Proud of it as I am. So thank you right on back, bruv.
Her: ‚ÄúDo you have anyone to talk to?‚Äù  Me after talking with her as if we were having a talk: https://t.co/3NCMF2AVB8
I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that my doctor doesn‚Äôt retain much of the information I tell her because she keeps asking me if I have a therapist. And I wanna be like, ‚ÄúDoc...if you ask me that one more time I‚Äôm going to have to stop having these talks with you. Insurance is limited.‚Äù
@juggalo_guy @DjMayonnaise You only think that because Radiohead was so ashamed to have a catchy pop hit that they paid lawyers to assert the Mandela Effect worldwide, falsely attributing the song to Oasis. Because who the heck would ever remember Oasis? They're creeps.
Slow and steady wins the race, fuckface. https://t.co/JcW5YnVOpV
@DjMayonnaise Hahaaaaaa. I recognize their brilliance. It‚Äôs just not for me. And the two times I saw them at festivals we were both playing at, they didn‚Äôt even play Wonderwall. And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúGah...get over yourselves. Play the goddamn HIT!‚Äù

Counterproductive tweet for someone like me who basically makes a living off of shirt sales, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can always suppress my visceral reaction when I see dumb shirts. And THAT, folks, is why u can rely on me making music forever as I suck the bullets outta my feet.
@jmacNcheesewiz HA. Nawwwwwww. Ain't no one know a Sage Francis t-shirt.
Dammmmmn, man...that's a cool t-shirt you have. Super cool shirt. Props on that shirt with an image that represents you before I know anything about you. Dope t-shirt. You're probably awesome. We'll see I guess. If you accept my date request based on your stupid fucking t-shirt.

Rare footage of me slapping a dude in the face before sitting down to do a song about a fairy with broken wings. Half of the San Fran crowd filtered out of the club like, "OMG, not cool!"

@creaturelives33 When I'm driving in its range I'll always see what's going on there. Haven't heard a hip-hop show on there in ages though. I drive either during the early morning or late at night. How are the hip-hop programs these days? Still from 3-6 every weekday?
@matt_rego @creaturelives33 Hahahaa. Really though...probably.
@creaturelives33 It‚Äôs pretty much all I listen to. Not that I could ever list stats or provide hot takes. I get a kick out of the callers and personalities though.
Shout out to fans who used to give me mixed CDs while on tour or even through the mail. Still my favorite stuff to listen to when I feel like taking a break from sports talk radio. Future generations will re-discover this lost art...if they can figure out how to download streams.
@perezjohn633 Heh. Ah. Days of yore...when if I caught you throwing balled up pieces of paper at me while I was performing, I‚Äôd kindly invite you to the front of the crowd and you‚Äôd get one or two of these. https://t.co/btURoUIIkv

@nonrardy I've got plans for my collection, but that's....amazing. I don't think I'll collect enough tabs in time for me to rock the tab vest.
@aaron916 @JoeRyan6468 I reference this in an up and coming @EpicBeardMen song and then I was like, "Wait.......is anyone going to understand what the hell I'm talking about?" So this is a relief.
@aesop2020 Yeah, I am on Bad Religion's "Let Them Eat War" song. Not sure why my name's not listed as a feature, but that's my voice. And my style. Accept no imitations! ha

@im_your_grandpa I mentioned that, but it was decided against for some reason. Really not sure of the details.
My nephew has a cast and can't go swimming with his friends this summer. He's been playing cards with his grandma instead. Today I slipped him a copy of one of my Calvin &amp; Hobbes books &amp; said, "This is one of my favorites. Hope you like it." His eyes lit up. I left the house like https://t.co/QL7GfD5yXf
@printmatic It‚Äôs an ever-losing battle. The venues are stuck on the idea that the later people stay there, the more drinks they‚Äôll buy at the bar. It does hurt attendance and it sucks for everyone who has to wait all night long.
@TheLlamunist There‚Äôs piano on Sea Lion? Also, it‚Äôs faux pas to ask about samples. I will never answer questions like that and they shouldn‚Äôt be asked publicly. But, no, all the instrumentation is by Will Oldham. Drums by Alias.
@Jramz3y Oh, I‚Äôm glad you asked. It‚Äôs basically because [REDACTED] due to [REDACTED] as well as a [censored] circumstance gets resolved when [REDACTED] goes to [censored,] but then I‚Äôll probably still play everything close to the vest due to safety reasons &amp; [censored] dumdums being dumb.
I‚Äôve been hogtied recently in regard to the kind of things I can post about. And that‚Äôs especially frustrating to someone like me who spends almost every day alone.

@Urrrggblop Not from all I've researched, but if you have a solid source that Enter the Dragon was made on a much higher budget I'm down to check them out. Bruce Lee did not have the Hollywood muscle to make a high budget movie at that time. Many corners had to be cut. Many favors were made.
This masterpiece was made on a $250,000 budget. No matter how many millions of dollars a company will put into a remake, they‚Äôre not going to make a better #EnterTheDragon. You‚Äôre better off doing something that comes ‚Äústraight out a comic book.‚Äù https://t.co/SoSp0L8VaB

For the record, Iceland is awesome. I've been there 6 times and it's closer than a lot of people think. If I ever go "missing", I'm not concerned about people searching for me in awful Iceland. Because it's very far away &amp; super duper cold with awful people. Who'd ever go there?!
@daggums Aye. I'm sorry, Jess. I don't know the specifics of your situation, but that really sucks. On the flip side, if the person didn't want to be with you for *whatever* reason, count your blessings that they didn't drag it out longer than they did.
Toward the end of a 6 yr relationship I remember my gf being upset that I drove onto an off road. Cuz it was bumpy. I was driving us around the "Golden Circle" in Iceland. Sure, we had some nice times together, but please know when a relationship's over before Iceland sucks for u

@_JackWinstanley Cats don't even like being around new cats for quite a while. You have to give it a couple weeks or up to a month for them to adjust. But if that's too much work or just won't work out, I hope you guys find a nice home for this beauty.

@5OXXYO5 Did he die? I don't know him. Sucks that someone so young went out like that. I've also read about the sexual abuse and the physical abuse he's dished out, so I'm not all torn up about it to be honest. There are wonderful people I know fighting for their life over here so...

@AbandonThought OKAYYYY. You're invited to the...afterparty. Which will probably be at The Met in Providence, RI. If that's not too far from where you live. And I hope it isn't, because your tweet made me laugh and I haven't done so much laughing tonight. You're still not invited to the wedding!
@bigfunnybones Ha. Despite all the odds. Yes...she truly is.
@CCoffeeBlack @TeeniBean hahaaaaa. I was about to post a picture of us with the cats, but that's the perfect response. Yes, the cats definitely approve.
Welp...despite everything I've done to repel people from being close to me, she said yes. So here we are. in color this time. Because I love her to death. Until my death.

@K1NG_M1DWAY @juda5cow @deandelray Wait wait. I'm a he, man. Fuggiit....I'm HE-MAN. Haha. And Mr. Dean Man recorded our podcast a couple weeks ago. Just waiting for it to be released. By the power of Greyskull.
@EastownJ @noyokono At least was can agree on two things. I'll take it.
@UncleMobe True. Which is why my mentions are flooded with fuck faces like you. I expected it. We‚Äôre coming to an understanding now.
@UncleMobe Hey Fuck Face "Uncle Tommers", I just completed a full US tour. Including Hawaii. And then I made my way to South Korea. And now I'm resting, responding to your dumb ass. I'm definitely going to heaven after this.
@UncleMobe Why the fuck would you think I was from the UK?  You tell me, dickhead.  As I mentioned, I've toured the world for 20 years. In August I tour the UK. Again. Haha. Christ.
@K1NG_M1DWAY @GoldenGuido It's cute as hell how all of you dudes suddenly discovered the word "clout." Haha. Go review video games or something. Adults are talking.
@UncleMobe Heh. Fuck Face "Uncle Tommers" thinks that I'm from the UK just because I'm from New "England." That's precious. I'm taking a screenshot.
@sirseanathon Like who? I'm a hip-hop artist. And I don't have a track record of not talking shit when I feel the need to do so. Is that OK? It's wild that you've boiled this down to race, but do what you gotta do. I'm not going to say you're wrong for that if this is something you've noticed.
@Mufvsa_ I'm white. I care. That's kinda where I'm at with you I guess.

OK, well...*you* don't know who I am I guess. That's fine. I've toured this world for 20 years now. Built an independent label from the ground up.

@L3TT3RSNUMB3RS Oh, OK, so you just wanted to float it out there that you‚Äôve seen me do ‚Äúpretty shitty‚Äù things to people...but no examples. That‚Äôs a cool move. Heh. Do you, homie.
@L3TT3RSNUMB3RS @inihelene I'd like to hear of some instances where you saw me treat people shitty. If I was a meanie, and what you say is true, I'll own to it. Whatcha got?
@JusAllahMMA I don't really think my opinion on the matter is policing hip-hop.  All I know is both Nas and Kanye have been cancelled (for me.) And I'm surprised they aren't for others. But not really all that surprised I guess.

@GoldenGuido Heh. Well, I'm telling you I haven't. I'm sure I've done lot of regrettable things in the course of my life. I'm starting to regret engaging with people on Twitter who are doing mental gymnastics in order to excuse women beaters. Not totally though. It's still worth the discourse

@ughBrett @EpicBeardMen I love @ClickHole for making these bits. Their take on slam poetry is better than the typical and tired bullshit when it comes to mocking the spoken word community. Fuck...I'd gladly quit everything I do if it meant I could make a living contributing to videos like this. haha.
@Numonic7 In general, overall, it's worse. Most likely due to how easy it is for people to record songs these days, but even the most popular artists who are supported by the mainstream channels...it's definitely a step down in overall quality &amp; talent. Bless ur personal music world though

For the record, there's literally been only one person in my life who has admitted to not understanding what it's like to suffer from depression. I was so glad to hear him admit that. Maybe because he didn't have to deal with it...maybe because someone was finally honest about it
No one likes feeling like they‚Äôre unable to grasp something that‚Äôs discussed so much that it‚Äôs damn near omnipresent in our culture, so everyone feels compelled to be like, ‚ÄúNah I get it, bro. Here‚Äôs a phone number if you feel sad or alone.‚Äù
It‚Äôs damn near impossible to explain what being in love is like to someone who has never experienced it. In a way where they truly understand it. Same goes for depression.

@atmosphere @RAtheRuggedMan *narrator‚Äôs voice*: It didn‚Äôt do him well.
@atmosphere @RAtheRuggedMan I don't know what to tell you either. All I know is that playing Atmosphere songs consistently made people ask me who y'all were and I never saw folks talk shit about ya on the forums. I took special note of that &amp; I was like, "Be the opposite, self...that'll surely do you well!"
@CbusApril Huh. That's very wrong. And I'm glad to finally see a crack in the facade of your tour manager perfectness.
@atmosphere @RAtheRuggedMan I was running a radio show in RI (playing your music,) I was DJing at CBGB's (playing your music,) &amp; I was lurking ALL hip-hop messageboards while running one of my own ~ '98/99. It struck me the way Atmosphere was one of the only groups that got full support and wasn't shit upon https://t.co/S7x11RaxzX
@RAtheRuggedMan @atmosphere I still maintain that almost no one hated on Atmosphere during the timeline I'm talking about. But I do know the hate you're talking about. I came up through it.

Out of all the things are horribly wrong with our country, the fact that Trump doesn't know the words to "God Bless America" is SERIOUSLY the least of our problems. No one knows the words to that song. It's a dumb fucking song. Even dumb motherfuckers like Trump know that much.

As a creative fuckface who can't make sense of things like maps/manuals/numbers, I'd like to give a shoutout to the "insights" option on fuckface social media sites. As if I'm susceptible at all to your graphs, numbers, influence, or purpose. I mean...what are these? Directions?!
@mykectown @EpicBeardMen I linked you to alladat: https://t.co/iwg61RmQJO But I also just sent you an email with more details, so...just respond to that with your addy and we goooooood.
@mykectown We just toured off of the @EpicBeardMen "Season 1" EP, which we offer as a free download: https://t.co/iwg61RmQJO If you prefer Bandcamp, it's here: https://t.co/A6oNsSWcvJ
@mykectown Yep. But if you're down to review the EP, mayyyyybe I'll send one of these vinyl copies your way? Nah...that's probably illegal in the world of ethical journalism. But mayyyybe?! ha
@mykectown I replaced music with sports talk radio. I don‚Äôt want you to do that because I still want you to review our shit, but you don‚Äôt have to understand the rules in order to enjoy the hilarity that ensues in sports talk radio. Helps to be in New England maybe. The accents play a role.
@mykectown It‚Äôs stuff like this that became my gateway into enjoying professional sports. They‚Äôre the best soap operas in town besides Days of Our Lives.
@CrispySpeedruns @wcsportscamp So maybe he's just...manic. What do I know though? I'm just a professional depressive. What I know for sure is that he was cancelled a long time ago in my wonderful world of fuckalladis.
Maybe it's because the whole world has been telling Kanye that he's crazy, so, to him, that means he's bi-polar. Let's just be thankful he didn't name his album:  "I'm Not Schizophrenic, and Neither Am I" https://t.co/NYKFYc4tl8
@wcsportscamp He‚Äôs talking about how his mental illness isn‚Äôt a disability. It makes him a super hero. Still problematic. And dumb. But that‚Äôs him.

@TheeMarkZ @jfwong @XellTweets @SirenMika Huh. I'll also have to go back and rewatch. But I was under the assumption that people in the past had to be completely unaware of the whole time travel thing.
@jfwong @TheeMarkZ @XellTweets @SirenMika Good. I enjoyed Looper. But I still have a question no one has been able to answer. Emily Blunt asks ‚Äúso you‚Äôre a Looper?‚Äù and I can‚Äôt figure out why she should know what the heck that is as she‚Äôs living in the past.
@allonevoice It's relatable in a lot of ways depending on the mood and situation. Heh. I wrote it about 14 years ago though, so I can't say with certainty what inspired it.

@Xibalbus @Storm_Davis I've long lost the ability to be in two places at once. But even if I could do that, I'd still need Storm there to take care of everything I can no longer deal with. He's made SFR his own magic workshop, so he's definitely the key master to all the moving parts in our operation.
Happy Birthday to the man who holds the whole #StrangeFamous ship together, through all the combinations of deep frustration and random ridiculousness that this business can throw at us. And I'm sure I'm frustrating as well. But you, @Storm_Davis, have been an incredible captain.

@AnyDem2020 @snydxr @PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem You're right...his spousal abuse is much better than his subpar music making post-2002.
@PinkyDoo08 @snydxr @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Wanna know what's super cute? You tag @Eminem as if he'd ever respond or react to a single thing you tweet about. He's never done so. He never will. I do...even though you're dumb as fuck. 'Cause I'm dumb as fuck too. I pay attention. But that'll end really soon. Enjoy it for now
@snydxr @PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Am I really coming across as upset, orrrrrr does it just make you upset to realize that Eminem is so shitty that he'd be a dumdum to even attempt "ripping" a Drake or Pusha at this point? Haha. Fuckin'....he wouldn't touch any rapper (esp ones w/ ghostwriters) with a 10 ft pole.
@snydxr @PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem I mean....I'm doing alright, my man. I run a record label, I've got a couple houses, I'm a proud daddy of two cats, and I travel the world freely. All while having a fanbase that "gets" my weirdness. What else could you possibly need if you're an artist in this age of bullllshit?
@snydxr @PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Wait, are you talking to me and calling me a casual hiphop fan? Hahaaaaaaa. That's precious. Sorry to bust your bubble, but I played shows w/ Em before he blew up. I've followed a similar path all while having zero engagement with the BS that plagues his life &amp;...I'm doing good.
@snydxr @PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem You're dumb as fuck if you think Eminem has had enough gas in his tank to dismantle any pop entity since the early 2000's.
@PinkyDoo08 @Eminem Oh, so now girls can't be dickheads? OK, cuntface.
@PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Wow, Thanks For Not Learning A Single Thing In our Exchange! I Do My Best, But You Truly Need More Help Than I Can Provide With These Stupid Twitter Responses. Block Me Before I Block You So I Know That It's Real!
@PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Fuck Off, Dick Head.
I don't engage in online Soap Opera beef as nearly often as I should if I truly cared about my career, but I do make enough of an effort to say the kind of things that keeps my fanbase below the average number that TMZ would consider newsworthy when I do so. All in all...#Winning
@PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Enjoy Your Strange Famous Recognition.
@PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem You Are So Wise, Pinky Dinky Doo Doo. Please Tell Me How Else To Do My Stuff!!
Coward blocked me after he posted up like he was a brave Stan soldier. I hope he didn't delete his dumb tweet. Context is King.
@PinkyDoo08 @praise_rowan @adram268 @psupporter666 @Eminem Thank you. I'm not shit. But that doesn't mean I'll come eat your shit. Stay golden, pony girl.
@squaretacos He "went at" them. Kinda? Most of everyone he really went after were toast before he would dare approached 'em on record with silly bullshit. Is it not common knowledge that his whole schtick was attacking easy targets? I thought it was. Anywayyy, I'm tired of talking about this.
@ItsDAAAVE Me? The original disaholic? Ha. Gratefully, I didn't make a career out of it. I was a successful battle rapper though. And I talked a lot of shit whenever I felt like it outside of songs. Still do to an extent. It's not what I typically prefer to dedicate my creative side to.
@PractikalRaps Well, to be sure, pop star do-nothings have typically been his easy target over the years. He did do Everlast something awful once upon a time though.
Depends. Would he be using the "Insult Dog" voice? You may find this hard to believe in all your Standome, but unless you're talking about a Kardashian or Britney Spears, the answer is no. A hard no. Actually, what in the world makes you think he could even finish a Kim K in 2018 https://t.co/LyyPu9nq2j
@BrownNoahlb I also said, "the first to show any sign of discomfort loses."  Toxic relationships are toxic. Communication is key, Mr. Brown. Always living and learning.
@odogg333 @EpicBeardMen Finally, someone who plays poker! Ha.
The 1st take we did was perfect except I got too hype during the chorus &amp; hopped around in circles. Which u can't do without pulling out lots of wires while wearing studio headphones. Also, Bob Dylan used this mic. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@EpicBeardMen ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/iv1R7m63aY
@Asim_Shady @Southpawer @Eminem Sorry to ruffle the feathers of #TeamShady, but my point is that I‚Äôm relieved that rappers in this situation aren‚Äôt doing the over-aggro rap voice that that Eminem uses (and others have since mimicked) when he wants people to know he‚Äôs really REALLY....like *really* mad you guys!
@Xibalbus I‚Äôll be back in August. We‚Äôll have to bite our top lips next time to even everything out.
@HavartiParty Yeah, sounds like a strong no on our end. I wish you the very best though!
@HavartiParty Hiring for what?
And I sang the chorus incessantly to the point where my girlfriend fell out of love with me. Hence, my own emo rap career was born. Happy 23rd! https://t.co/gAU8PW29nV
@mightymuds @KindaNeat @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen It was a bit cramped, but it worked. ha. Legendary hallway right there.
@diane32 @BDolanSFR üíú
@CodeSwitchATL I think the fake snarl and over the top angry voice was popularized by him. At least it‚Äôs mimicked to hell by a lot of people who fancy themselves battle rappers.
@TrevorSpaeth This guy gets it.
@PinkyDoo08 @psupporter666 @Eminem It‚Äôs cute that you think that.
@JustCaustic Well, I won the battles he lost. But no.
The biggest positive out of this Drake/Pusha ‚Äúbattle‚Äù is that neither of them are doing the overly dramatic angry voice. I appreciate the calm demeanor. We‚Äôre all very lucky that Eminem and his battle rap offspring have no part in this.

@Limbsical I don't get sick of performing any song.
Why do I care? I hate seeing talented people lose out. Not just because I run a record label. I simply hate seeing talented people not take the extra steps in entails to prolong their career and try to guarantee they won't succumb to kickstarter campaigns when times get "tough."
3) You've been lucky enough to acquire a ravenous fanbase who doesn't know how to treat you like an actual human being, which means that your presence at the merch booth is a detriment to sales rather than it is a benefit. AKA...not you.
2) You can't manage to muster the energy it takes to interact with the public. You need peace and quiet backstage. I can certainly identify with this reasoning, but not when you are the kind of artist who absolutely needs to make money to live on for the next year or...many years
1) You don't have merch to sell. You didn't take the time to put anything together and/or you know this isn't worth your time because this is just a hobby of yours and you know this isn't going to be worth the time, effort, expense...because you're kinda wack. So...respeck.
"Why do you work your own merch booth?" "All the better to photobomb you, my dear."  This post has long been in the making and I dedicate it to every touring artist who thinks they're too good, busy, tired, or important to work their own merch area.
@rljd @illingsworth More work for you. More work with all of that grammar, punctuation, capitalization, etc... WAS IT WORTH IT? WAS IT?!?!?!

@strange_femme_5 Oooooh, the do do man.
@PScolardi @alaska_ATOMS That's how being a rapper works.
@rljd It's the top offense in my shit brain when it comes to our smart ass. I'm sorry. Thankfully I'm getting this off of my chest now, so maybe I won't have to sit on your "a/an" assholery for a few extra seconds every time I come across it. Haha. More so than "all of the sudden."
@rljd It hurts my brain and it's *a unfollowable offense!
@rljd @bradsucks Why do you insist on not using ‚Äúan‚Äù when it makes sense to do do? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve explained this at some point, but it drives me crazy and I need to know your reasoning.

@NekoCase This guy is stuck on the idea that a mere fact constitutes as journalism. He should take a journalism ethics class. Might be of great use. Maybe not. Maybe TMZ has taken over the MacDonaldization of all ‚Äújournalism‚Äù in 2018.
@gene_lyman @espyem @NekoCase Well, yeah. Fuck him and all the fools like him. This is what's considered music journalism to dumdums and it's all too common these days. No sense in not hurling a little insult from time to time. Might give a fool a reason to pause and rethink his shit.
This was before it was common for people to do spoken word or acapellas during hiphop shows. My memory of watching Rhymefest have this revelation always makes me laugh. To think that Kim K is now trying to drag him on twitter...lawdy. Life's truly weird. No complaints really.

@RichieHardcore It's a lifelong thing that I've been getting a greater grasp on and understanding of with time. I know not to make rash decisions in that state. And I also know it's not usually a situational thing. It just happens from time to time and I have to power through. Thank you though.
*to me
It's funny to that Rhymefest is trending and why. My one and only experience with him was way back in the day when he was at a show of mine. He took me to his car to check out a track and he said, "I know what I have to do now... ...... .... ... ....... POEMS!"  He's a good dude.
@RealJustinCrass Well, it looks like Best of Times is the most popular with the masses. Either that or Sea Lion. https://t.co/u5Lir5nL4H
@jackassjimmy Heh. You can view this on the Rock the Bells documentary when I opened up for Wu Tang during their 10 year anniversary and the first time they were all on stage together in ages. I feel like I dealt with it pretty well. Nothing in the performance world shakes me up all that much.
@charliedastrike Yes and yes.
I hit a depression slump today &amp; realized that this is probably why I should go back on medication now that I‚Äôm home. Instead, I got a tub of ice cream and now I‚Äôm slide-dancing through the kitchen in my socks. But this is how fat claws stick into a Sage. Gotta dance it off. üíÉüèª

@illtronicon I think the same about playing Evansville as I do anywhere else. If it works out, it works out and I'll be there. And I'll break myself on stage for all that it's worth no matter how many people show up.
@babshegarty I'm happy to see that.
@Whiskey_Rob Who farted? I think it was Will Smith.  I checked his underwears. He left Fresh Prints.
@illtronicon That's such good question. I wish I had a good answer for it. I link way too many negative experiences to every album and tour I've done. That's a me problem. I'm working on it.
@no1readsmyshit It‚Äôd be easier to answer what artists I don‚Äôt listen to. And that‚Äôs pretty much every artist my fans probably listen to. Sports talk radio consumes most of my listening time.
@BadAssMother400 Absolutely not. Heh. That ship sailed ages ago. I went on to do a variety of things, as I did before the whole NP thing. And he went on to do his thing.

@DanGlassmeyer @JussSomeDude Man, you have to ask him. He's somewhere online I'm sure of it.
@AngelosArnis I work best in small, intimate environments. So I like it. But I also know it's not good for the business we run. So it makes me think I need to restructure my whole life. But that's a battle I have in my head every other day, so fuck it.

@lujan_matthew4 I'd be like, "I thought you sucked for a while...boy was I wrong. CHECK THIS OUT!" as I point to pretty much any artist that's appeared on XXL's Freshman issue.
@waffleblaster No, but I like that you have interest in doing something like that. Personally, I have zero interest in eating anything with people who I am not very close with.
@caryshannah We performed at CJ Azit in Seoul, and at Revel in Busan. It was the end of the tumultuous tour so we were totally thrilled. Even though I was sick as hell thanks to whatever awful stomach virus I contracted in Hawaii.
@hepple88 There's not typically much time for exploring. If there's extra time it typically goes to catching up on rest or work. But exploring happens in many ways, so I guess I could have just said, "yes."

I've promised my lady that I'm going to get good enough at braiding hair that I'll eventually lock down the french braid. I'm basically just trying to pull her hair, but like...in a fancy way. Eventually.
@marktstanton @sudoScience_ It earned him a block. Fuggit. Enough with these guys.
@JensenClan88 I...I‚Äôve had that argument. Haha
@713Entr0py @atmosphere I mean, yeah, but sometimes people get muted. Heh. I usually press "like" as a way of saying "I saw what you said, thanks for your input." Not, "I liked what you said, please stay in my mentions about everything even if it's not totally on topic."
It felt like Kent State the way they targeted the students. #SlowDownGandhi https://t.co/ultZvj94ta
We're in Korea! The Seoul show is tomorrow, Busan on Saturday. I've basically been dealing with Hawaii's version of Montezuma's Revenge for the past 4 days. Compound that with jet lag. But fix it all with Korean food, coffee &amp; love notes from home. @EpicBeardMen will rock y'all. https://t.co/1UfPo1Ce2p
@SinsHere89 @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR I‚Äôm reading Demian.  Yes, we‚Äôll return probably in October when the EBM album drops.
@TimChamberlain @BDolanSFR Ha. He's at the beach during our last day in Hawaii. I'm catching up on email business. We need this time apart.
@BradLohaus54 He's just always upset and sweaty and I'm getting negative viiiiiiibes, brah. Gonna block him soon.
I keep seeing the same schlubby person at our hotel and I finally just said, ‚Äúget out of my mentions.‚Äù
@Storm_Davis You're trending, foo. Post a SoundCloud link STAT. #storm
@prophecypro @PScolardi @nickgu__ You know a fair amount of 3 syllable words. I‚Äôm not sure you use them in proper context, but I‚Äôm still impressed. https://t.co/xyQ3KggCoV
@prophecypro @PScolardi @nickgu__ Heh. Right, right. I was just kind of waiting for you to use the word pretentious. Thank you for making it all work out the way I had it playing out in my head when I realized maybe you didn't totally mean to say "facetious."
@prophecypro @PScolardi @nickgu__ Oh, so did you mean "pretentious" or "facetious"?
@prophecypro @PScolardi @nickgu__ Well, one thing is for sure. I'm not being facetious. I'm not sure if you know what that word means, but the fact that I'm completely comfortable making this statement (or uhhh...throwing stones from a mediocre glass house) is not facetious at all.
@prophecypro @PScolardi @nickgu__ Yet, here I am. Completely comfortable in doing so.
@prophecypro @PScolardi @nickgu__ Low bar. Enjoy that low bar life.
@dntBmisinformed @WhateverOG @mcsole Haha I mean, I'm not trying to drag the dude.... but he straight up looks like Peter Griffin.
@nickgu__ @PScolardi Eminem discussion aside, agree to disagree on "one bad album" by Nas. I mean, his shit has been awful to me for so long. But we all have opinions, man. One thing that's not an opinion is that he's a piece of shit.
@PhilipSBrett @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen Goddamn happy to return and with someone who appreciates spicy food. Thanks so much for helping facilitate this Korean tour for us. Love ya.

@WakeTheFlokUp @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR ha. Well, I'm just responding to your tweet. That you @'ed at us.
@WakeTheFlokUp @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR You can't start a promo tweet with an "@" my man. Hahaa. Considering all that you do + your passion for this stuff, there's no way you're just learning this now. And I mean this with all due respeck. You should make the tweet without an "@" as the very first thing &amp; include link.
@WhateverOG Someone who remembers the HipHopInfinity forum has the nerve to ignore all that I've done since that point to be where I am now? That's precious. Hahaaa. That's such a throwback to early day hate that I kinda respect it. #GoodShit

It's really special how you give specific shoutouts to your preferred propaganda channel. This is not weird at all and, unrelated to your MSM preference, you're totally not going to end up in prison if this country has a morsel of justice left in it. https://t.co/sxUELve5QN
@AleeBabblez Glad we can agree on something. https://t.co/5psct70dyN
@MEATY_THOT I really touched a nerve with the meh contingent of hiphop fans. I never fell on! Haha. If that‚Äôs how you see things so be it. I feel very comfortable in my statement after 20 years of Nas being a disappointment.
@shannons_butt It used to be at least.
@Numonic7 @undabawse It's one of the only pictures that makes me know for sure I wasn't adopted.

@rmadsen714 @CrookedIntriago My conclusion that you might actually be wrong is ridiculous? Haha. I think you're being a bit too hyperbolic. I checked your timeline and it seems you're a good dude. I'll leave it at that.

@_mcchris I'm not giving out grades. However, I have an email I'm waiting to send you though once @BDolanSFR sends me what I'm interested in having you check out.
@LukasGiesman Yes, me. And many other people obviously. I can be disappointed in Nas and worry about my own music at the same time. It's not the highest level of multi-tasking I've ever engaged in, homie.
@YouKnowBREY That. Would. Be. SO. Badass!  Keep getting all that üí∞, monstahhh!!!
@chazbrown22 @herogothamdesrv @CrookedIntriago And, yeah, thanks @CrookedIntriago
@chazbrown22 @herogothamdesrv @CrookedIntriago You should wonder why Crooked I never engages with you despite your non-stop tweets at him. Take a hint, homie.
@chazbrown22 @herogothamdesrv B-b-b-but I read your twitter bio and it turns out we‚Äôre both a ‚Äúfan of gorgeous women‚Äù! What are the chances?! Ahhhhh haha. Fucking cornball.

@DeanJames1969 @nived3rd That‚Äôs what Twitter is all about, baby!
@DeanJames1969 @nived3rd I‚Äôm guessing your reading comprehension skills are subpar.
@armendberisha11 Nah.
@DeanJames1969 @nived3rd There‚Äôs a catalog? What‚Äôs the catalog? What shit really takes you for a special ride on any level?
@misterdoubleb @TrashManGarbage @Drone0rion @Nas You like a lot of shitty shit. But Crooked I liked my tweet about this Nas BS, and I thought you might enjoy that lil tidbit.
@therealrulez I'm in the 25 cent bin in the dot because people bought my albums and then retired their CD collection. I'm now rolling in that t-dot Spotify cashhhhhhh. Which isn't much, because that's the nature of music streams, but you just got learnt. https://t.co/GSG9cyR8r4
@shankingla @therealrulez It's the go-to reference for people who typically don't have a leg to stand on. This is too fun to ignore overall though.
@therealrulez They aren't. But you live in Canada.
When it feels like you‚Äôre going through hell, keep trolling.
@therealrulez You might be a good person. I don't know you. But you're bad at Twitter. Do you feel that way sometimes? Is that feeling starting to come to the surface at all for you?
@therealrulez Dawg, I'm well past the suicidal stage. I'm back in my sexy bitch stage. https://t.co/HfcFoYDBT2
@amandaecollins @Blutus_Maximus I'm gonna find me a heart surgeon who moonlights as a tattoo artist and get this done.
@YoBoyNDizzle No, I haven‚Äôt heard their music. Hated to hear about what happened though. Awful.
@therealrulez Haha. Well, I *am* currently touring around active volcanoes. Thanks for the well wishes. üôèüèª https://t.co/naeGVdOzHo
@Blutus_Maximus First time I did karaoke was at my high school graduation party, and that‚Äôs the song I chose. I sang it ironically to a group of people I knew I‚Äôd probably never see again, but I do love that song.
@therealrulez I'm going back to rehab.  Rehab.  Rehab. I'm going back to rehab. Huh...I don't think so.
@therealrulez Maybe you got into Nas during his lesser years, and maybe you're a fan of "meh Nas" so he's never fallen off to you. That's what I'm talm bout.
@vocabmaestro A quick drop off from messiah to meh. Cube can still be Cube. Nas hasn't shown the ability to do what put him on top for decades now. It's not an argument I want to have for every day of my life, so I'll start ignoring the issue again soon. Ha. Happy to vent for now.
@armendberisha11 *you‚Äôre https://t.co/8VQdyUCLP6
@millyarnZz Post-1994 Nas is not for me.
@Drone0rion @PractikalRaps Gahbidge person.
@TCVB91 From undisputed king to highly contested top 20 mention.
@IvanVilla Based on what? He was in the #1 spot right off the bat. To me and heaps of others. There was a steep drop off after that and I have a tough time putting him in the top 20, let alone top 5.
@that_shadydude The ones who are inclined to speak freely and truthfully.
@constantremind Top 5...through it all? Ha. Absolutely not. Not even close.
@lotus_film I have 5 more days to do something like that.
@17sLuckyBastard I don‚Äôt give credence to awards like that. That‚Äôs never part of the overall equation in what I talk about.
@100PaceNinja I‚Äôm not talking relevance. At all.
@samacks21 @PractikalRaps Go on...
@toblaTleahciM It didn't help that the beat was awful while it was bubbling in the womb.
@ninetynineand90 I know...I kinda cheated on the 5 words rule. Sorry.
@LandonGibson I don't even have somewhere to fall from?  What?? Where am I, Mista Gibson? How am I even living? I support several people in my life and in my business. Please don't bust my fantasy bubble, Landon! ha
@TallBiancaXO Hurts, yeah? Join the club. ha
@Nas ü•¶
@herogothamdesrv I enjoyed maybe half of It Was Written. That was that with me.
@PractikalRaps Damn, I'm just answering your question.
@PractikalRaps I have no idea what "relevance" equates to in the big picture. I do know he's turned out to be a piece of shit human with heaps of lousy creative output.
There is not a single rapper who fell off harder than Nas in the history of hiphop.
Fuck yo' politics.
@Yangchingpo Yes. But tomorrow we will be on the Big Island for four days. I'm actually just camped out in the hotel taking care of random business. heh.
Twitter is the only social media site I feel comfortable enough to completely disrespect with random ass thoughts. Thanks for not killing me over my bullshit.
The art of feeling one with everything while being completely disconnected.
@PropAnon @EpicBeardMen Too late! haha
Imagine showing full support to people who you love while they're still alive rather than saving all the energy until after they die. That'd be some shit.
Truth. Also truth...fuck Pitchfork. https://t.co/ZXew7QWphP
@lunchbox651 Hmmmmmmm. Probably Baton Rouge. But I blame the promoter, not the city/fans.
@Chris_Strom @EpicBeardMen All I have to say is how often I hear about the "tuck rule", even in 2018, and it always makes me grin.
@MasterNate69 @MisterNBS Heh. Most don't. It's the safe way to be.
@NathalieWith1H I don't know their music, but I saw the news and...well...it's fucked. Sucks.
@Ground_Link haha not really. Maybe once I get out of Honolulu, which is basically a military base posing as a tourist trap.
@JarydBurcham Glorious locks.
@kurthustleSF There's no meaning. Make sense of it as you go. Hopefully it adds up to something in all of this sad math.
@techmobowlhigh5 @EpicBeardMen Skating backwards is my thang! Ha. And I also have a penchant for blocking pucks with my body. Should‚Äôve been a goalie.
@JussSomeDude @EpicBeardMen It‚Äôs one of those things that I feel I‚Äôve heard in a lot of old movies.
@MisterNBS Failure is common. If someone can't deal with failure, they have no future in any enterprise.
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen I was 12.
@amandaecollins As it looks right now, RI will be the very last show of 2018 for the #EpicBeardMen massive.
@ceylon_premium @EpicBeardMen I believe he runs a barber shop right now. And he does music under the name Prison Guard. I might have that wrong. Last time I spoke with him I told him I missed his raps and he didn't believe anyone really missed his raps. But I miss his raps for realz. His beats are great obsly
@techmobowlhigh5 @EpicBeardMen That's great, man! I have been eyeing adult leagues for a while. I'm finally at a weight where its feasible again. Ha. I'm best as a defenseman, but my high school coach determined I was best used as a goon posing as a wing.
@arfjets80 Getting kicked out. Kicking other people out. All types of kicking outs in life? ha.   I'LL NEVER REVEAL THE ESCAPE ARTIST SECRET!
@techmobowlhigh5 @EpicBeardMen I started playing hockey around age 4. Last time I skated was as a captain of my high school hockey team. I have wide ass feet though, so it hurts like hell. But, yes, I can.
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen I wish I knew with certainty there would eventually be a person I could really envelop myself in without having to make a bunch of concessions. I'm not sure, but I think my life has been negatively affected by accepting the worst case scenario as an inevitable end. We'll see! ha
@JackShittJr @EpicBeardMen @Buck65 By the way, there was a rapper from RI called Jack Shit in the 90's and I love that name.
@JackShittJr @EpicBeardMen @Buck65 Buck is on a nationally syndicated radio show in Canada. Outside of that, he decided to leave the music world and so social media sphere for his own mental well-being. I'm jealous as hell.
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen Kinda?
@Ground_Link @EpicBeardMen No, but we‚Äôve been doing so at all the EBM shows.
@Double_D05 @EpicBeardMen I'm just glad you think it's fresh. Freshness can be very subjective when it comes to art/music. But I beat myself up over my music and writing, so if it ever comes across as stale...that would really suck for the kid.
@guyallenmorse @EpicBeardMen I'm making love to the present more than ever.
@Limbsical @EpicBeardMen I actually explained this very well in a recent podcast I did. I can't remember if it was with @ItsIntuition or @deandelray, but either way it's not available yet. Long story short, I realized I had no real home life and I was basically killing myself. Touring has been my life.
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen It's about a lotttttttt of people. But there was one person who I used to watch during my lunch break at Ben &amp; Jerry's who wore wings while she performed at a nearby cafe.
@tjland99 @EpicBeardMen I do a kick out of Elvis impersonators though. There's a charm in that.
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen That's a very complicated and long story. It was not good times.
@JayTheZilla @EpicBeardMen Ha. @BDolanSFR would be like, "Of course."
@tjland99 @EpicBeardMen He was a hero to most. But fuck him and John Wayne. #SimpleAndPlain
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen *father's middle name.
@Jramz3y @EpicBeardMen I mean...is it dope enough of a line for it to be fabricated? Heh. Seriously. It's just autobiographical rap.
@JayTheZilla @EpicBeardMen The bulk of those songs were scattered on my "Sick" mixtapes. All available on my bandcamp page or at https://t.co/qI6L2BFsNF
@seaforeex @EpicBeardMen Not often. Sometimes. And sometimes I memorize it while recording due to how many takes I typically do.
@ShrikeHunter @EpicBeardMen I‚Äôm not sure, but I often have to accept that a lot of people have no idea how art works.
@FMBIII @EpicBeardMen Curtis Plum suffers from a severe case of schizophrenia and it took a turn for the worst several years ago. It's been a difficult thing for him and his family as well as us. It's a horrible thing to deal with. I'll explain more when the time is right.
@seaforeex @EpicBeardMen Constant repetition. Constant repetition. Constant repetition. Constant repetition. Constant repetition. Constant repetition. Then perform it in front of a crowd and realize you need to fuck up a couple times in front of people before you can really nail it. Then more repetition.
@lujan_matthew4 @EpicBeardMen Alias gave me the beat. I wrote to it. RIP @AliasAnticon da gawd. Miss the hell out of that dude on a deep level. We're all in constant recovery mode over his loss.  https://t.co/5z4tlu3efO
@mikey_mike415 @EpicBeardMen Great year.
@lunchbox651 @EpicBeardMen Not really. Right now it's Two Different Worlds I guess. I have the "favorites" game. ha.  https://t.co/lY6bLwlRns
@craftteaguy @EpicBeardMen I don't often drink tea, but when I do I prefer chai.
@DynastyMechanic @EpicBeardMen Most of my songs are like that. Because that song was me telling a story and talking to someone who I can't talk to.
@TheMouthPlays @EpicBeardMen Amazingly enough, nothing has changed from the original idea. We're still just building it and learning new things as we go. But the original idea was to keep it as fun/interesting/punchy/bizarre as possible without going too far off the rails.
@lsmithdesign @EpicBeardMen My natural inclination to be creative and expressive in a controlled format, and rap's word-heavy format.
@JermellVarnes @EpicBeardMen Why did my mom join the Army and then go AWOL? I don't know what the heck moms are up to, but...it's something.
@ChangeIater @EpicBeardMen Nothing specific. Maybe just me practicing normal conversation styles.
@THETomMcInerney @EpicBeardMen Nah. I don't think so. That was a chore.
@Dystyntmysfyt @2WydEys Ahhhh. Well, I'll be in Hilo for 4 days starting tomorrow so I'll give updates on that.
@TheVEALCHOP @EpicBeardMen "Why not both?!" - Zoidberg
@ChangeIater @EpicBeardMen All the time. I already have a recording unit written on my to-do list. It's a very long to-do list.
@mrsjessSzabo @EpicBeardMen I don't really do the "favorites" thing for almost anything.
@Mac_gasm @EpicBeardMen Post Office is what started it all for me. He put decades of his love/hate for that job into that book and it kicked off his writing career, so I put that up there.
#AMA This is my off day in Honolulu, my skin cannot tolerate the sun, I'm booking trains for our @EpicBeardMen's Korean tour, and my grrrl is at work so she can't entertain my constant need for affection. Therefor, it's the perfect time to have an hour long "Ask Me Anything" sesh

@StrangeBrew76 @toxictoastLBC @AWOLONE @SFRupdates @EpicBeardMen Whatever you want. You name the price. Cash or credit.
@MasterNate69 We have a video for it that we‚Äôll release in June. ü§úü§õ
@Michael_Goggans Alrighty then, Memphis. https://t.co/LbRxALhFnP
@Girlyougotstyle @Timbeseen The UK dates have been announced, and Manchester is definitely on that list: https://t.co/cHVtxkPZvX

So many people have jobs where they can‚Äôt openly scream at the top of their lungs whenever they want without getting fired. That sucks. I‚Äôm sorry.
@bri_rakotz @djkhaled I didn't say pussies were useless in general. I said one specific pussy was useless.
@djkhaled you useless pussy.
Hey DJ Khaled,  If that is your real name...if you‚Äôre really a DJ...üòÜ. If you‚Äôre not walking around with the scent of your woman on your beard for at least two days after servicing her for both of your enjoyment, shave your beard off. You‚Äôre unworthy. - @EpicBeardMen

@bigjimmurray Just so you know, when I‚Äôm able to check the podcasts of each show while I‚Äôm traveling from city to city, your semi-contained outrage keeps me going.
@pacerquik Why is this relevant? He was just convicted. I mean...maybe that doesn‚Äôt make it relevant (because what‚Äôs really objectively relevant,) but it‚Äôs timely. Despite how long it took. #TimesUp

@mikey_mike415 @pedlow1977 @DJPrincePaul Hard no on that one. HARD PASS.

@pedlow1977 @DJPrincePaul As far as samples go, it's almost necessary we use as many samples as possible and don't clear any of them for this to be a true "Xaul Zan &amp; the Dew Doo Man" jawn. So most likely we won't BANK on this project. Maybe though. $ getting stuck to the gum under the table stylezzzz. ha
@TheRealSloeT @DJPrincePaul haaaa. It's time, man. It's time. For that Presidential run.

@Dylonius @sonnapolazzo @SinsHere89 Yeah, but this is fun.
@sonnapolazzo @SinsHere89 This is your judgment day. Poor ratings. Low score. You still have time to turn things around. Life is long...not forever. Ditch the meth and impress the ref.

@sonnapolazzo @SinsHere89 BTW, your avi makes me think you‚Äôre on meth, so I‚Äôm going at half harshness.  Because, really, I‚Äôm not trying to put your feelings completely in the dumps. I do hope you‚Äôre ok overall.
@sonnapolazzo @SinsHere89 How dare you disrespect father with disingenuous bullshit.
@sonnapolazzo @SinsHere89 üò¥
@sudoScience_ @kanyewest I believe it. Not proud of it, but these are crazy times.
@JDEFINITEMC I thought it was highly unnecessary. But I can‚Äôt begrudge one of my favorite groups of all time.
@TyePeterson Every time I see those campaigns I shake my damn head. Like...oh, you were careless with your equipment in a city known for stealing shit and now you‚Äôre going to whine for replacement equipment money? Ha. Like, what‚Äôs the guarantee you won‚Äôt just be a careless dick with it again?
@Strange_Powers That‚Äôs what the fuck I‚Äôm saying. We all end up there at some point. Save your charity outreach for those kind of situations and stop asking for handouts while there are others in dire need.
@Atmosph3rik @sonnapolazzo Of course.
@sonnapolazzo @ChangeIater  https://t.co/IVqp8yr5iR
@joshhw Tell her that. I'm done.
@sonnapolazzo Look at how you came at me, then revisit your whole "mindful, peaceful debate" comment. You're completely disingenuous. Not only are you woefully ignorant of music, race, and our history, but you're just...ignorant. I might give you a pass if you weren't all of the above, but nah
@MrWzGotBz We were never invited to the "table." Ever. And that's quite alright.
@sonnapolazzo I'm angry? Heh. Take your unnecessary exclamation points and shove 'em wherever you need 'em.
@sonnapolazzo Good luck with all of that.
@sonnapolazzo How about this....you're out of your depth. So maybe shut the fuck up already.
@elyse_sanford @EpicBeardMen I didn't have the foresight for that. But you can see it in past photos of me and recent photos of me.
@cmpn My battle is with the unnecessary gofundme‚Äôs in these dire times.
Too many rappers/musicians/artists who throw gofundme campaigns don't realizing they should 100% preserve that online begging shit for more dire, medical situations. You can sell albums &amp; get paid to perform if you're good enough. What you'll NEED is medical and/or funeral $ tho.
Kanye...from the bottom of my heart...go away for maybe 5 years. Live in the woods or something. I say this in hopes you recover from the fuckery of people you surround yourself with and not so you‚Äôll end up sending out mailbombs. @kanyewest https://t.co/du9AS2XHHM
@reachfortheskyz I've been in each city for less than 24 hours from day to day. Where you been?

@natianne518 @BDolanSFR I‚Äôm an Expedia user and it can show you the rates of all hotels/motels in the area. I know about hotels in virtually every other place than where I live.
@natianne518 @BDolanSFR Heh. Boston. Nah. You‚Äôll have to pick a place outside of Boston that‚Äôs on your way back to Albany.
@redball @sonnapolazzo Ha. I mean, yeah. There are a lot of layers I‚Äôm trying to sift through here. Couldn‚Äôt tell if this person was being inronic, satirical, serious, or just trolling for troll‚Äôs sake.
@ThePiz I think 10pm
@sonnapolazzo Did you miss the part where he totally dismissed hiphop as a craft that was capable of delving into true human emotion? I can see you‚Äôre sprung on the cat for whatever reason, and that‚Äôs totally fine, but as far as your contributions go to this discussion...go fuck yourself. üòò
@sonnapolazzo How does this relate to anything? Serious question. Are you okay?

Special shout to the venue we played the other day who didn‚Äôt have us listed on their website &amp; they had the gall to tell us we weren‚Äôt promoting enough. And shouts to ppl who tell us to play their city a week after we played it. I have *maybe* 1 year left of caring this much. üíú

@vocabmaestro Some orange juice tastes great. We just need to know it‚Äôs not *good* for us. It‚Äôs basically a sugar shot.
Sorry, guys...I gotta see about a girl. https://t.co/c4fpMasEfn
The best thing about this weight loss is I have no corporation, business, or special/secret diet to attribute this to. I have no sponsors to shout out. Fuck sugar, sugary drinks (including juice,) bread, grains, unnecessary carbs...forever. Except on special occasions obviously.
@Fraeuleind0kt0r @EpicBeardMen Yeah, I mean...I knew I was taking in more calories than I was burning. I‚Äôm not a dummy. But shit is not easy when you‚Äôre dealing with awful thoughts all the time. Thankfully I eventually visited a doctor. Also, shouts to @deandelray, @redban, and @joerogan for their talky talks.
@patty_guillen8 @EpicBeardMen I didn‚Äôt think I could quit bread. I thought it was essential for every meal in order to feel ‚Äúfull.‚Äù It‚Äôs INSANE how quickly the pounds fell away after giving up on that idea. Seriously. I‚Äôm no health guru, but cripes almighty. We need to go easy on bread.
A question I keep getting on this @EpicBeardMen tour is if I‚Äôve been working out. No, I slowed WAY down on sugar, bread, grains, &amp; depression eating. If it looks like I‚Äôve been working out it‚Äôs only cuz you‚Äôre seeing the muscles it took to carry an extra 50lbs for 15 yrs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@goonsquadjavi @atmosphere I was in ny at the time.
@ughBrett @EpicBeardMen @Mike_Eagle @Busdriverr I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôre the best fit to open up for a brand new group. Ha. I‚Äôd love to do shows with them, but we‚Äôre looking for someone who might not be able to headline their own show.
@RAtheRuggedMan @atmosphere This is only after things got really big. But in the late 90s until 2001/2002, the needle on the random hater needle barely budged. I was amazed. Cuz they‚Äôre clearly a manufactured label plant with Target backing them with finances. I keep trying to tell these folks!
@JussSomeDude @EpicBeardMen @progeny210 @BDolanSFR I made it difficult on purpose. Because I knew he was having back problems. I'm a bad friend.

@JingsNdthings Heh. He should have been more assertive and forthcoming. Like..."cereal is total bullshit. It's a 'treat,' not a meal. And your body doesn't know what to do with a full box which is why I'm doing my best to let you know it's a bad idea. Look at me. LOOK AT ME. I should do better"
@JPorres12 @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen @SFRupdates Th...there are posters included in the tweet. My man. There are posters in the tweet you're responding to. And links. The name of the club in Seoul is CJ Azit. You're the second person to ask this question though, and it's making me concerned for the future of all that we do. ha

@duncanjewett Haha yes, this is definitely in the #OriginStory of "Escape Artist."
Ahhh jeez...#RIPHarryAnderson.  I believe his autobiography is the first I ever read. He hipped me to classic con games and inspired me to get into street tricks which actually sustained me for a while during my first stint in NYC. #NightCourt should be on rerun syndication 4-eva
@AbandonThought I really don‚Äôt know. Haven‚Äôt gotten any recent updates for June. Should be fine though.
@FathersFour South America. Antarctica. Most tropic islands. A lot of places I want to go actually.
@natianne518 Your profile says you live in the northeast.
@RitualsofMine @fetemusic I appreciate the offer. However, I‚Äôm also on tour. Hope it‚Äôs a great night for you. Salute!
@redhamuSLA @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates No. Sad.
@EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates @DoIndieKorea @PhilipSBrett The ones we hashmarked. And they‚Äôre listed on the posters. Heh. Seoul and Busan.

@notoriousrwg Yes.
@pun_guyz Yeah. You don't win this awful contest. Sorry I won't divulge my stories to a supposed fan who doesn't follow me on twitter. heh. You can claim the win. This isn't the time or place for me to tell the kind of stories that I'd end up having to speak about in all future interviews.
@pun_guyz I highly doubt it.
@pun_guyz You don't really even want to know that answer.
@lilshroom92 I cherish 'em. For the most part. Not all. But most.
@MichaelAGoin @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen That‚Äôs my girl!
@svenllama Absolutely. That's a whole other can of worms though. Haha. Same with running a label I guess. And I'm sure sound engineers would like to weigh in on how little recognition they get for making the show sound as good as it does. (Sometimes.)
@svenllama I don't believe I stated it at all. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you though.
@guyallenmorse That‚Äôs @BDolanSFR‚Äôs story.
3000 views in 3 days is good, but...what‚Äôs taking the rest of y‚Äôall so long to check this out? Don‚Äôt try to boycott our fun. Resistance is futile.

@Rich_Fog @Scroobiuspipyo @BDolanSFR No comment.
@fatherjack @Scroobiuspipyo @BDolanSFR TOTALLY!!!!!!!!! ha. Don't be dumb.
We (the artists/musicians) have become the main promoters of shows. It's not enough that we write and record songs, release the records, create the whole show, perform the whole show, and a million other things. We have to promote. So, hey, really...don't go to the fucking shows.
@stellarcreep Nah. Not really.
@Rob_Sonic @mykectown As someone who has released tons of material with great ranging sound quality, from the worst sounding cassette tape to the best sounding vinyl, I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen anyone comment on the fidelity. Ha. I mean...seriously. This shit is ridiculous.
@Electronitect Have a like! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@mykectown I like how people pretend to ‚Äúreally‚Äù give a fuck. As if audiophile is a medical condition and people feel intent on proving their illness with these needs. Just press the vinyl faster and let‚Äôs go. Ha

@deluxebros If I considered him an authentic rapper and we had actual beef, I just might do that. But, either way, dipshits would just claim I was just doing it for attention. So I'm glad to have a way to communicate my ideas to the world via Twitter and just be labeled a "hater." Fuck it.
@dresmonde You know what‚Äôs really weird? When people I don‚Äôt really know expect a personal shoutout when I roll through their city. Because if they knew me they‚Äôd know how insane my schedule is from day to day. God forbid a bloke gets inconvenienced by signing up for @SFRupdates‚Äô newsletter
@JussSomeDude No. I saw the first episode but I don‚Äôt have an account where I can watch it online. Just when it airs on TV.

@MrWzGotBz heh..."one."
@bangUwitApickle Hahaaa yeah but, "think tank" was what I intended to write and I ended up with brain trust. "Can't trust no brain these days," thinks the tank.
@bangUwitApickle Fuck...I meant to say think tank instead of brain trust. Haha. I should have run this by my advisers before tweeting. I know the rules.
Drake is a human study group posing as a brain trust passing as authentic.
@kevinjmacd @EpicBeardMen In September. Stay tuned.
@TimChamberlain Haaa. I forgot all about that. Thankfully there are dozens of Xaul Zan fans to remind me. But they‚Äôll be very disappointed by the lack of Mr. Zan‚Äôs production. He‚Äôs been MIA for a long time.
@StrangEWterWrld I'm really sorry to hear that. I can't imagine how sloppy that whole "inheritance" shit can get. It would just be best for people to accept that they have no right to anything due to a family member's death. That might save a lot of people from q shitty legal circus.
@muelmix1244 @thebig3c @EpicBeardMen Once we do the MidWest run.........expect it! It'll happen this year.
My Mom follows me on Twitter.  So I know she'll see this. It's OK...I'd do the same if I had a kid.  Just know this is not my really real life.  It's the kind of talk I'd partake in if I was at a bar and feeling froggy. Or at the edge of a cliff.  But I'm not jumping. Love youuu!

@tylernol415 It‚Äôs advice rap.
@XChrisXStarX Heh. It's a very "retreat and turn inward" type of track.
@Electronitect Wrote that as a spoken word piece in 1998 or so. Holy Jebus....two decades ago. That's a long time to hold a poker face.
@JessamynMcIntyr @Kno Ha!!!
@spacyxstacy Mmmm. It's not a rap song though.

@_davidma Thanks, homie. I mean, Alias produced at least two of my most popular songs and they're staples in my live show. So it kind of bugs me out whenever a fan of mine says they don't know who he is. I'm going to do my best to remedy that.
@AndrewFails Yeah, @Metaballo...what up tho?
You blocked me but I know you‚Äôre seeing this. Fix yourself.

@arfjets80 Classic @BDolanSFR quote right thur. I use it often.
@fostermatt See you next month!
Otherwise, let's have a brief heart-to-heart. Life is long. Not forever.
For the record, a hug is not like the handshake game. It's not an opportunity to show who is more dominant. And if you think you're being violated, and that's why you get all stiff and weird, you should just opt out of the hug all together. No judgment, fam. I luh you regardless.
After our PDX @EpicBeardMen show, I hugged everyone as I normally do. And then I encountered a family whose hugs reminded me of what I was like before I was comfortable with hugs. I explained to them that I understood their stiff, uncomfortable hug-life...cuz I've been there. Sad

When I returned home, my girlfriend made a sign that said, "CONGRATUFUCKULATIONS!" Which I thought was super sweet. But then she told me she didn't want me to tour anymore. And now her kids with another guy are about as old as this trophy.  https://t.co/lY6bLwlRns @EpicBeardMenüôå

@papageezy @SFRupdates @MrDibbs @KevinBeacham We had a lot of fun freestyles together. I'll take that any day.

@atmosphere @SuzyHip_Hop @mcsole My dynamics are too deep for this puddle!
@AskAnthem @AnthemInc Too late for that. I‚Äôm a touring artist and I already put in the time to make this happen before I left. It‚Äôs not the first time my doctor tried to help out and then you, my insurance company, made things more difficult than necessary. So I‚Äôm moving on.
@gothzillah13 Things are better. It's the principle of it though. Thank you.
@thechrisbarron @reason2try @AlexandriaVaun @Drumdums @EpicBeardMen @davidemmanuelt @DavidHThornton @ModernHorrors @CmlEntertainmen You misspelled ‚ÄúFear of a Black Planet.‚Äù @PublicEnemyFTP
@JussSomeDude I'd rather slap him like a cop.
@ChangeIater @AnthemInc @AskAnthem What a wonderful way to keep your identity ambiguous online. Hey, Blue Cross / Blue Shield...you are a big part of the problem. Thanks for being so compliant in the problematic process of US healthcare. Keep making that money I guess. Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...
@ChangeIater @AnthemInc @AskAnthem Are they? I mean...if they are, it's pretty damn ambiguous.
@Rvltion909 I'm on massive vitamin D supplements as well. Thankfully I have enough of a supply to hold me over until I get back home.
So, thanks to our wonderful healthcare system, I'll be off my meds until further notice. If I fall into a deep depression and blow up to be 300 pounds at the end of April, send a shout out to Blue Cross who conveniently aren't on Twitter for dragging purposes. I'll be good though
@ChangeIater Yes, that was the reference. ‚úÖ
Had a really awful travel day yesterday after having an amazing day. But today we recovered our lost luggage, my med withdrawals are chilling out (thanks Blue Cross for not giving the "vacation override" in time,) and our GPS has been found. #AllThingsAreTurningUpFrancis in 2018.
Yah rite, mon. Time to set it off.  https://t.co/lG3qIFvC5m  #swag #swag @EpicBeardMen #swag https://t.co/ZIrPocKZj9
@AtlasHendrixCo I know. It‚Äôs insane the dip in engagement I get on my artist page considering what it was like before they basically insisted on us paying for our posts to be seen.
I get more covers of my vines than I do my songs. Not mad at that. Not mad at all. #MakeSpringGreatAgain https://t.co/m2wQXC38ux
@SSRob44 ha...seems you haven't checked out that site in a while. Give it a look.
@SSRob44 Mass evacuation.
@DREADNOK Their ads got out of control. It pushes people out. Sounds familiar, eh?
My organic outreach went from 100,000‚Äôs to 100 or so. I built much of my success by interacting with fans online. I‚Äôve made FB the lowest priority at this point on the socials. And if they think they can‚Äôt be MySpaced, they‚Äôre very wrong. https://t.co/E5clkHPgCt

@prolyphic @matt_rego Are those still around? The last time I was there was with the football team and one of our teammates threw up and salad came out of his nose.
@G_Superfly Not this time. This time I‚Äôm wearing my fancy jacket.
I'm sorry, Providence. I was feeling very vulnerable and it's an emotional time. I'll play a show in you again. Probably. But I'll never forget your lack of fancy restaurant recommendations in a time of need. We're gonna need to spend some time apart for now. I'll be back. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@KrazeeDD @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates Haaaa. What a great collection. Honored to be included with Lionel Richie and Tron!
@JohanBarbarossa Hahaa. So dumb it‚Äôs great.
@SlayerBook @EpicBeardMen I played Super Mario Bros. INCESSANTLY as a kid. I worked out every pattern and learned how to beat the game in a little over 5 minutes. Using the Warp Zones obviously. I always thought I'd be able to get out of the sneaky Negative World, but I don't think that was possible.
@MC1985FTW Huh, no. I‚Äôve never seen that.
@CoreyStroff @twiabp I had to settle for Yelp to help me out. Hah. Reservations made at a secret place now. Tomorrow I‚Äôll know if I did the right thing.
@Flobot5 Yeah, I was at the last show there I believe. It was absolutely insane.
@Flobot5 That is my spot. That‚Äôll have to wait though.
@Flobot5 Haha I‚Äôll kill you.
@MisterShifters There‚Äôs a lifetime of home cooking if all goes well. But I‚Äôm going to set shit off in a fancy restaurant just because. Even if we don‚Äôt have the etiquette down.
@twiabp üò°
@prolyphic The schmanciest.
Congratulations, Providence.  I'm never going to play a show in you ever again.  FUCK OFF, FUCK FACE SHITTY FAKE CITY!
Fucking loser-ass home city with zero-ass recommendations.
Hey Providence,  I've never been on a dinner date. I have a fancy dinner date in my near future and I'm looking for recommendations. Help me not lose. Thank you so much.
It's been too long since I've played Los Angeles. My home away from home away from home. The early bird tickets already sold out for our @EpicBeardMen show on May 7th at @UnionClubLA, but late birds are my kind of birds. We get the late worms.

@danharmon You‚Äôre hated out of love. Tough spot
@JussSomeDude @EpicBeardMen Big shout to @DJSwabDK
I'm so happy people have rallied around @EpicBeardMen's #TwoDifferentWorlds. It's one of those songs that was so off kilter we weren't sure if people would take to it. But now we're turning every show into an anti-prom and the slow dancing is magnificent. https://t.co/lY6bLwDsM2

@rhythmicalexile ....doap.
RIP #StephenHawking I'll never understand even a fraction of what it took for you to make sense of the things you made sense of in this impossibly confusing universe. Thank you.
@joerogan I‚Äôm doing my best to keep up with your podcasts. In the last one I heard you said no one wants to hear from a rapper who lives in a log cabin. I‚Äôve been making it work for the past 20 years. I‚Äôd love the opportunity to explain this to you in person if you‚Äôll have me. ü§úüçÜü§õ
@Inkymole @SFRupdates Hahaaaaa. Awesome little time capsule right there. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@casOne1 They also hate taking walks in the rain.
I double checked with the promoter and he said there‚Äôs no chance the Portland show will be cancelled. Because Maine folks are too proud to let snow stop them from doing anything. Hahaa. Be safe out there. https://t.co/rIBQaWDnoN
@space538 @BDolanSFR I was just about to ask you if the show is still on despite the blizzard warning. Whoop whoop!
@Grungekid84 @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen Love it!
Contrary to popular belief, you can pick your family.
@MikeMokray @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates Right now it looks like some time in mid to late May.
@MRanglinVassell #SpolerAlert Leonardo DiCaprio dies at the end. He was new money and the old money didn't like his sporty ways.
@MRanglinVassell Maybe start learning while you‚Äôre cooped up inside before the snow melts. I‚Äôm totally going to do the same thing. Next year maybe.
@robertchute @Storm_Davis @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen @SFRupdates That show will need to be postponed due to the snow.
@chrisimmunity One big mixed set.
@chrisimmunity You should be fine with pics
@SFRupdates @BDolanSFR @EpicBeardMen And I must say, there are definitely people who missed the #EpicBeardMen announcement. They were the people at the shows like, ‚ÄúHoly shit...what is this? You got any new music?‚Äù
@cacabware It‚Äôs looking that way. I just got an email about a potential rescheduling.
@Stephaniegd28 @SFRupdates üî•‚ù§Ô∏èüî•
@daggums No way.
@daggums No suh.
@daggums I don‚Äôt know anything about a storm. Haven‚Äôt been in touch with the news. What‚Äôs up now?

Right before the @epicbeardmen tour, my cat was using my merch boxes as a perch for a better view of the television. I feel bad for taking the boxes with me, but daddy can afford to buy him a new jungle for exercise now. Happy Caturday! https://t.co/K94epKNL8E

Thinking of Barry Crimmins every day. I only knew him for a couple years, but it‚Äôs like we were lifelong pals. I‚Äôm guessing most people who knew him felt the same way. https://t.co/GxC6wWHuzl
@daddywolfhawk1 @ericb65 It's been a couple months. But the last few times I spoke with him he seemed to be doing great. He'll return when he feels like getting back into the hustle and bustle of what it is we do. Depending on if he ever feels that way I suppose.
@lancedyzak_ @AdeemTheArtist I just released a free EP as part of the @EpicBeardMen (https://t.co/iwg61RmQJO) and touring North America. Also, searching my name to make sure no one says anything false or awful about me because I've got my goddamn lawyer on speed dial. We share cups of tea &amp; discuss things!
@EpicBeardMen haaaa. @RegencyInn is a real throwback to when people couldn't write a review that would be viewable by thousands of people at the click of a button. I kinda respect it.
@selfcha @dylanbowman11 @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates @casOne1 Hahaa. Didn‚Äôt notice his head in a jar until right now. Saul Williams is up there too. Good company.

@Skycloud9000 I performed "Thank You" over a hundred times during the #CoppeGone tour. And a few times after it. It works best as a spoken word piece I think.

@Sisa555123 I mean...I'm a rapper. That means the answer is me. It's me. I'm the best of all time. #RapScience
@adenellis No. That's not something that can be revisited. That album was finished in 2003 and it was a tribute to all the hip-hop I grew up loving. There's no follow-up. Also, thank you. Glad you enjoy @EpicBeardMen
@Madallionair I didn't stop coming to Madison, WI.  Madison, WI just needs to be patient for my return. I'll be there with @EpicBeardMen in due time.
@EyesofBigBro Because I have zero game probably.
@Waaaaaarb He smells really nice. @BDolanSFR uses care products I know nothing about.
@caryshannah Maybe. I don't know. I'll leave that decision to the promoters of each place we play as I obviously have a better understanding of each region than I do and I'll be swamped with other matters of business, travel, duties, responsibilities. If you're doap there's hoap.
@Jphizzle96 Honestly, it's a mixed bag. So many people have connected to various albums for whatever reason in a way that they say changed their life. It's always an honor to hear something like that.
@yendysnnud You're asking about the forum. That wasn't my "website." Ha. But it was riddled with viruses which was affecting https://t.co/qI6L2BFsNF and we had to shut it down. Unfortunately. I miss it. But the activity slowed down to a trickle with social media taking over everyone's time.
@JDEFINITEMC Prince Paul, DJ Shadow, Bomb Squad, and El-P have topped that list for ages.
@Lunahhh I‚Äôm not sure yet. I‚Äôve been thinking about Sirens of Titan a lot lately though.
@dylanbowman11 Less and less with each passing day. I don‚Äôt want to see myself on my walls but I do like the reminders that people dig what I do.
@dylanbowman11 I‚Äôve lent it to worse things.
@Stephaniegd28 I wish I knew.
@neilpwalsh @therealelp @KillerMike Lords is a cool muffucka.
@chrisimmunity The last few days were a kick to the nuts. I lowered my shoulders and trudged forward to do what needed to be done. Following through with plans that were set in place many months ago. Feeling a lot better know despite being 15% awake.
@FledLast Maybe it's an idea of someone. Too soon to say.
@jaim_e0219 I know I can't possibly understand all the nuances in everyone's life. I give advice when asked because it's always worth reaching out...in hopes of letting people know there's hope. But people need to dig deep down and fight the fight that fights the good fight. I root for them.
@nathanbiehl @KingKangKool Wow...that's fucking....yes.
@FledLast Smitten.
@notforgottenrap Wanna battle in Baltimore? On @BDolanSFR Birthday? How much alliteration can you handle?
@deaconlf There are a lot of people I've worked with who ended up retiring due to all the work it takes to make this shit pop. It doesn't really phase me because....well, every day I think of doing the same. That's not an uncommon feeling.
@TheFantom Honestly, I don't divide hip-hop like that. It's a bunch of wack shit with a sliver of dope shit. People can like what they want though.
@amandaecollins hahaa no. HBO left me waiting too long before the last season of Leftover so I canceled my subscription.
@neilpwalsh I've been following @therealelp since 1996 and I was fortunate enough to meet @KillerMike several years ago when they were touring the North East before RTJ was a thing. I'm humbled by everything they've been able to do and I'm kind of left in awe of the whole process.
@Tantrick614 Something that tastes great without bread. (I'm currently on an anti-bread kick and it's helped me lose at least 30 pounds.)
@TheMouthPlays If it sounds cliche, that might mean it's been said a million times. If you can change it enough to mean the same thing and not sound like what a million other people have said, you're on the right path.
@IsaNahilaS Currently planning a tour through the UK in late August as part of the @EpicBeardMen, and hoping to build a Euro tour around that.
@haptic_ Improving yourself and understanding that if you weren't the one for her, she's not the the one for you. Case closed. There's no forcing it.
@KingKangKool Heh, I dunno. Yesterday a guy brought his girlfriend to a show and she was like, "I knew about you 15 years ago when you were 'big,' but this is the first show I went to. So good!" And it was one of the weirdest backhanded compliments I've received in a while.
@TweterLundblad What's the outlet that keeps me writing?
@VanessaG_2020 Absolutely. A lot of people have been asking about territories we're not even close to touring in with the first couple of announcements, but we'll definitely be making out way through the midwest and all other regions. Stay tuned! hit up the newsletter at https://t.co/qI6L2BFsNF

@Frogman980 @adamjones985 @NickC985 There should be a website dedicated to calling out non-tippers.
@bobbySshows So...you think I don't grow talent? I just pick up all the big names? heh
@SlashThread It's crazy. Like...one of the weirdest fucking vinyls I own.
@bobbySshows Well, there's only so much time in the day for me to hunt down every suggestion. I find people in different ways and make my decisions based on more factors than I could easily list. But yeah, I may have missed out on the next Chance. Chances are I didn't.
@SlashThread Wow....I'm pretty sure I have a white label vinyl of his from wayyyy back in the day.
@SDizzyDoRight It's such a throwback. It used to be like that everywhere. But NYC is a special time capsule to that era now.
@scratched_vinyl Thank you for taking the time. And allowing the fun to flow through! Haha. üî•üôèüèªüî•
@BDolanSFR @Chasevarga @EpicBeardMen @SFRupdates Well known fact: I wear them for the freaks.
@Kno of course!
NYC is one of the last places where you find yourself in a precarious position when it‚Äôs made known you run a record label. If someone doesn‚Äôt have an album in the works, their relative does. So, yes, I will checkout your son on YouTube, Mr Bodega guy. ü§úüçÜü§õ

@NickC985 I‚Äôm gonna save you a hoodie, Cattles. EXTRA SMALL!
@jimboshu @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates Not yet. Gotta believe me when I say that Chicago is one of my favorite cities in the world. We will make our way through midwest at some point this year. If not, I'll just book one show. In Chicago. I miss it.
@DJPrincePaul No joke. In every music venture I enter into there's always a Prince Paul influence in the approach. Somehow or another. Not that anyone has ever noticed, but maybe that's good. ha. Salute.

@ContentRealist It's cute that you think the basics of spelling, grammar, and punctuation has anything to do with "itellectualism." First of all, do you not see the red squiggly lines under the words you type? Those red squiggly lines are your homie. Holler at 'em!

@RapBooklets @SharpCheddar856 @WeAreDeLaSoul @TommyBoyEnt @RapMusicGuide @DJPrincePaul @DeLaSoulsDugout @PlugWonDeLaSoul @discogs @EgyptoKnuckles @ZillaRocca It's weird for me to just be discovering that this insert wasn't included in all the versions. That's sad. Obviously it wasn't the most important part of the album, but it was such a cool, original, and surprising supplement to it.
@SharpCheddar856 @WeAreDeLaSoul @TommyBoyEnt @RapMusicGuide @DJPrincePaul @DeLaSoulsDugout @RapBooklets @PlugWonDeLaSoul Yes. Obviously. haha. That's the comic I was mentioning. Was it not included in future pressings?
@VaiveRick @DJPrincePaul BK Lounge was on the follow up album though. De La Soul is Dead.
@SharpCheddar856 @WeAreDeLaSoul @XMenMovies Yeah, the liner notes that came with the original tape included an illustrated comic. It was a long fold out. I'm not sure what subsequential versions had.
@daggums Sounds like a perfect fit! https://t.co/GvFwmOFnkN
Extra special shoutout to @DJPrincePaul for his involvement in shaping the style, mood, and zaniness. I had a VHS tape that showed him sampling random Disney records to make beats that I love and it was a real eye opener in how to work with corny shit to make it awesome.
@Chazraps No, I haven‚Äôt. Is it on Netflix?
I remember sitting in the car with my dad after buying this tape and unfolding the comic that was inside. Everything about this was magical and it inspired so much of what I‚Äôve done since that point. Also, fuck sample laws. Peace to all the plugs. https://t.co/nt9lX8RCza
@seezmics @EpicBeardMen Yesterday no one mentioned "Dumb Ass Kids" and I started getting a bit scared that it's not the smacker we believed it to be. But today there are a bunch of people shouting it out. So I guess we'll move forward with the video idea. haha
@IDBLACKOFFICIAL Haha I'm not surprised to hear that. But I'm mainly looking for someone who only wants to be paid for 20 days rather than 365.
My juiciest fantasy is being able to trust someone to handle all ends of business while I just bask in the creative end of shit. And I feel like that's probably common among people in my position. All I know is this tedious, dry, internet BS wasn't what I envisioned as a 12yr old
It's days like these when I wish I had a manager, because there's literally not enough time to do all the things I need to do. But I don't think I can hire someone who knows the ins &amp; outs of our business to dedicate themselves to us for 20 days out of the year. Is that a thing?
@ReyBee10 @EpicBeardMen Yessss. We filmed a music video for that last week. Hope to release it soon.
@OldManCount @EpicBeardMen It's part of the chorus. C'mon, I need people to know their parts at the shows.
@OldManCount @EpicBeardMen No no no noooo!
@DrWyk @EpicBeardMen Our pleasure. I can‚Äôt wait for the first time we get to bring that to the stage this Monday.
@4rilla @EpicBeardMen Brooooklynnnnnnnn, WUDDUP! See you at C'Mon Everybody.
The feedback we've gotten for @EpicBeardMen #Season1 has been so great. Thank you for all the support. So hey...you sitting there on a Saturday night all alone. What are the standout tracks to you? What are you hyped to see live? If you even go to shows. https://t.co/fEBN9LP5zE
@redball @EpicBeardMen You can name the price on Bandcamp: https://t.co/fEBN9LP5zE
@So_It_Goghs @EpicBeardMen We won‚Äôt have vinyl yet. It‚Äôll take a couple months for the manufacturer to get it to us. Their estimated time is late May.
@onozz717 Hahaaa. I think Danger Mouse took this photo when we were touring the UK in 2004. I'll need his contact at this point to get proper permission.

@shanker702 @ekohmusic @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR It hasn't been officially announced yet. Waiting for the ticket links. But it will be May 1st at Bunkhouse.
@Numonic7 @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR Interesting. I've never seen that before. I mean...whatever it takes to get people buying physical product I guess. Ha. I like it.

Tomorrow (today for some) we're leaking a new @EpicBeardMen song + announcing details on the #Season1 EP which drops March 2nd. Then we start touring.

@MasterNate69 The first and only NP album dropped in 2003. If there was ever to be a follow-up it would have happened by now. There's not though. And it's a deeply layered business/creative/artistic/personal complication. Long story short, it'll never happen.
@BDolanSFR @LastPass You‚Äôre only using 10% of your brain when you succumb to these traps, bro. Don‚Äôt let the remaining 90% which deals with numbers and patterns shrivel from the devil‚Äôs temptations! #Science
The part of the brain that was dedicated to memorizing phone numbers has been replaced with memorizing passwords. #FactNotOpinion
@Numonic7 @EpicBeardMen Yeah, I've performed it pretty frequently. Way more than most songs in my catalog. I tend to do it over a chiptune version of Pixies' "Where Is My Mind?"
@selfcha @EpicBeardMen No, the Timberlake thing was just for shits and giggles. 8 brand new songs will be released in a little over a week. Official announcement and details on Monday.
@selfcha @EpicBeardMen We have an EP name. And that EP is as long as a lot of albums. But the official album drops in October with all new songs. :-O
I know it might seem like we're too short on material to fill a whole set with @EpicBeardMen songs, but there will be a heap of new EBM tracks released in a little over a week. Shhhhh.

@BookishFeminist Very misleading and misinformed tweet, Sarah.
@BookishFeminist Ahem... https://t.co/OlnIkBmsOs
Schindler's List wasn't pro-Nazi.  #SpoilAMovieIn5Words
@TheDeadRef I'd say that too if I didn't recently watch a few routines that had me chopping onions.
What I'd say...if I didn't know how serious modern day Germany is about reflecting on their sordid past and making sure that horrible history of theirs is never repeated. If this skater was a pro-Nazi, why in the world would they put their routine to music from Schindler's List? https://t.co/MXaigXye3p
@rhythmicalexile #MomsSpaghetti was no joke.
@rhythmicalexile Hahaa hell yeah, they did. A lot of battles felt like make-or-break for people, so they'd tighten up and say the most ridiculous shit.
This video just gave me a shot of nostalgia to the days when the person in a freestyle competition said something so self-owning that they spent the rest of their time trying to figure out how they‚Äôd be able to have a career once the battle was over. https://t.co/hwvoEJ1ImK

@lacroixwater I have a business proposal and even though you're probably just an intern at La Croix I think it's best for us to discuss this publically.
My favorite New Year's Eve I can remember was in Grand Junction.

@KevTheiceman Haha it‚Äôs OK. I have no choice but to listen because I like to stay interactive with people on my pages. But in instances like this I think it‚Äôs worth exposing the bullshit.
@EarlyAdopted My "brother" was my dog growing up. Half St. Bernard &amp; half German Shepherd. I remember the day before we had to put him down, and that shit lives in the deepest, saddest parts of the soul. But so many great years were shared and love is love. Glad you could share it w/ your dog.

@cars_and_trains @mtylerryan Ha!
@RyanR79 @mtylerryan If the public outreach from my fans about him being a dick was worse than him telling me I should have been the one who died rather than the friend who I miss dearly, I'm truly fucking sorry. I will reevaluate how I approach these trollings from here forward.
@RyanR79 @mtylerryan What if "dog" was spelled C-A-T?
@phantom_lv10 @davidthoughts Right, right. OK, I guess...I'm convinced. Of this old, outdated argument about how circumcision is beneficial.
@phantom_lv10 @davidthoughts Due to.....what?
@phantom_lv10 @davidthoughts What are they?
@phantom_lv10 @davidthoughts Sorry, I thought you said mental benefits. But still, the health benefits argument is still questionable at this point. Like I said twice already, we have the ability to clean our dicks in 2018.
@phantom_lv10 @davidthoughts Proven by who? And what kind of mental benefits? Is it from people who are not able to deal with having a dick that looks the way it's supposed to look even though it's not popular? I'm guessing that may be a big part of it. I don't know the study you're referencing though.
@davidthoughts Unnecessary loss of some of our most sensitive nerve endings, inflicting unnecessary pain on infants, a ridiculous body modification for what? Based on what? Some men can't clean their dicks? Again...it's 2018. That's my stance. Wish I wasn't circumcised. Wouldn't do it to my kid
@mtylerryan Misquoted my own lyrics, but fuggit. Things turned out the way I knew they would because I‚Äôm 20 years deep into the online troll war.
@mtylerryan Patience is a virtue.  Patience is a grace.  If I publicly haze,  Trolls change their face. https://t.co/bBPAUt7PCG
@davidthoughts Doing it as an infant is probably preferred because infants can't say no. The medical benefits of being circumcised are not entirely clear. Clean your dick and you should be good. We live in 2018. That's my stance from here on out. Heh.
@Numonic7 @SFRupdates @EpicBeardMen Nice!
@davidthoughts I don‚Äôt believe circumcision on infants should be allowed.
@sportsbud23 Thanks. Me too. Hope to be this way as long as I can.

@alexh0wl Are you a North Korean twitter-bot or what? Jesus effing Christ, dude. I‚Äôm not rallying for US occupation by any means, but you‚Äôre fucking dead set on being anonymous while simultaneously rallying for the nonsense that happens in NK. I‚Äôll let you do ur thing from here on out.‚úåÔ∏è

@alexh0wl Heh. Nah, that isn't me. But I look forward to seeing the results of your journey...if you're brave enough to details the events of an actual journey even if it's coming from your anonymous online profile.
@alexh0wl I'm so tired of anonymous figures online who are most likely between the ages of 15-24 thinking they know what the fuck they're talking about. Like I said, I look forward to hearing your reports from North Korea.
@Chasevarga @OrvilleIV https://t.co/OnqUHNvsp2
@alexh0wl I find it to be a lot more complicated and nuanced than the picture you‚Äôre trying to paint. But when you make your way to NK, please send me updates.
@alexh0wl I don't think it's cute. You asked me a question about my opinion and I gave an honest answer. Then you say, "Wrong!" Ha. Anyway, how do you think the Red Sox will do this year after the lack of acquisitions they made in the off season? Can't see how that will be good.
@alexh0wl sad pig is sad.
@alexh0wl Well, I guess I'll be seeing you in North Korea then. Let me know how it goes.
@Mikaelmusic1 Honorary @EpicBeardMen comrade. You're in!
@Mikaelmusic1 Shit, hope you're OK. Best wishes with that.
@alexh0wl I have a lot of concern over how they run things in North Korea, but we obviously have a very limited scope of what's what. But the secrecy &amp; propaganda is certainly a mark against them. I believe the citizens are suffering. Looking forward to returning to South Korea soon though
@alexh0wl We can count this as one of those times, yeah. As someone who's never thought of himself as cool, I'm just really chuffed you can go back to a time when you did. Makes me feel a little bit...cooler than I once did. I guess. ha. Not your intention I'm sure, but thanks anyway.

@Metermaids How in the world did you ever play hockey? Haha
@cravery If you're going to be in Vancouver on March 27, it would be nice to catch up. @EpicBeardMen are playing at The Venue.
Great video, great cause. #savetherio https://t.co/S5lVD2JB8l

@MrtheContractor About to drop 8 new songs in a few weeks via @EpicBeardMen
@mutatedmusings Good on you for getting on top of this in your 20s. That in itself is incredible. I had to wait until my 40s to give this treatment any credence. I constantly find myself shedding shitty understandings of what's best for me Vs. what I can afford. Or what I think I can afford. Heh
@hammerheadbat Ashamed to say that I wasn't brave enough to request medication. I simply explained my situation and hoped my Doctor would be keen enough to do what she thought was best. As I said already, so far so good. But a lot of work still needs to be done. Best wishes with your treatment.
@Numonic7 @ChiefSpanks Connecting dots. https://t.co/XV4UFKsDER
@mudpuncher I can lay it all out in songs no problem. But when it came to stating it plainly to my doctor, I was a stuttering, self-doubting, blubbering fuckface. Thankfully she didn't shuffle me away. Our relationship is a work in progress at this point.
@herb42069 I waited over a year after getting insurance to do anything medical related in my adult life. And it's wild seeing how fucked up the insurance scam is. I'm really sorry you have to deal with that. Best wishes moving forward.
@ecTwelve20two Dirt sound more nutritious for some reason.
Oh, and yeah, I'm aware that the whole "meds" thing comes with a stigma. It's weird having people hit me up back channel explaining how scared they are of being stigmatized or "losing themselves." I mean...I'm still figuring this out myself, but fuck all of that. Fuck depression.
@NathalieWith1H That's part of it.
@CbusApril I didn't have the time or energy for the gym while running the label, writing/recording Epic Beard Men songs, dealing with the physical drag of dental/doctor care, shopping the EBM stuff, petting my cats, etc. haha. Maybe I could have. But after the holiday season I was like... https://t.co/Lj3ePFSB77
@CbusApril I couldn't work out until a couple weeks ago. I'm trying to get back into the routine of hitting the gym but I start touring in a month. At which point, I'll try to make the stage my gym I guess. For the rest of the year. Not easy keeping proper health routines on the road. Haha
@CbusApril From 277 to 245. Mostly just from cutting out a lot of carbs and sugars.
Can't overlook the help of depression meds. This is the 1st time I've gotten professional help on what I've been dealing with for most of my life. I still have a lot to figure out, but I'm at the age where all the men in my family die &amp; I'm not trying to go out like that. #yckmmf
@adultcrash13 I‚Äôm so happy you tweeted that at me. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve heard that song, but I quote it often.
@adultcrash13 I love that song. Double X Posse, right?
@rascalfoley Running 5K daily? That's fucking amazing. Especially when there's 100lbs to lose. I know that isn't easy at all. Somehow my diet change has garnered more results than I experienced with the cardio stuff, but I'm starting to combine the two and it's feeling right.
@jlee_is_dude You're vastly underestimating how much one of my legs weigh. https://t.co/OYQxN4I36d
@Mike2600 I seriously didn't think I could give up bread. It was the most important part of most of my meals. But now I walk down the bread aisle at the supermarket like... https://t.co/Q4TUqHdwBJ
@daggums I don't want to eat things that aren't bread, pasta, starches, sugar, processed, yummy.
@OhDagEmily Maybe I'm exaggerating. I don't know. My Doctor will drop the truth-anvil on my bollocks in a few days.
I've lost 30 pounds since the new year. The trick is to not eat anything you actually want to eat. You can only eat the things you don't want to eat. And then you don't want to eat as much as you did when you enjoyed eating. EASY! #SageAdvice https://t.co/BMm63hynSv
@selfcha I‚Äôm always game for more vinyl. But I‚Äôm getting pickier with age considering how I‚Äôm running out of space to store it.
@undabawse @EpicBeardMen @seezmics @HeightKeech @EarlyAdopted @BDolanSFR Eventually, yes. This year. Still have a lot to figure out, but TX is in the plans.
@ChiefSpanks You're welcome! https://t.co/CVTNleuuAB
This is how I‚Äôm shedding my vinyl collection. Through our webstore orders. Haha. It makes me happy that it‚Äôs appreciated. But yes, it can be quite random. https://t.co/cIw3CIvbgq
@PoetWalker The future is looking bright.
@PoetWalker Hahaaaaa. WAT?
@deandelray It's still a great way to sell something at a merch table for someone who wants a memento, but I wouldn't be surprised if every store that's still selling CDs turns into vape shop within the next 4 years.
@SlimChaby @deandelray I run an indie label. CDs still sell slightly better than vinyl at this point, but it‚Äôs quickly turning into a niche market. Most people are turning toward streaming. Meh. Haha. Can‚Äôt do anything about that. But we‚Äôll still press physical product.
So...‚Äùactually, it was just a test‚Äù is the new normal now? https://t.co/sFZskjpOgc
@rubierandom @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates You know we gotsta hit Los Angelesssss. Lots of Cali shows should happen if the universe knows what's up. Stay tuned to @EpicBeardMen
@jaim_e0219 @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates I think we might be able to squeeze that in at some point this year. South County at least. I think that's close enough to Westerly, yeah? Ha. We'll see!!
I'm touring as part of the almighty @EpicBeardMen for all of 2018 starting in March with these 8 East Coast shows. More announcements for other territories coming very soon. For now get all show info &amp; sign up for the SFR newsletter at https://t.co/KBOPAKGCSA  #2018YearOfTheBeard https://t.co/QVtCnL27kN
Yo....good fucking game, Eagles. And I don't know how Foles went super saiyan in the last two games, but a backup QB really just did that. Congrats.
Super Bowl commercials usually have a multicultural theme. Not a fan of pandering, but I'm also not feeling that commercial where the wizard goes "Dilly Dilly!" and builds a wall of Bud Lite cases at the Mexican border. C'mon now.
@NickC985 Bizarre play calling.
@jonochapman82 @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR Ha. Well, if you'll notice I learned at an early age to speak in a way where my teeth hardly ever show.
@joshgondelman @NekoCase Haha you guys are dumb. I love it.
@atmosphere @natianne518 @BDolanSFR Huh. You wish. https://t.co/xm9GuwtTSG
@atmosphere @natianne518 @BDolanSFR Pfffffffff.....if sex made people smart then HOW AM I SUCH A GENIUS??!?!! https://t.co/TtLA3jDR50

@agentmotion @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates If I don't burn it all away before I die, there are a special few people who I hope will do the deed.
@coldlunch Haha. Well...songs, poetry, and albums are one thing. Tweets are a whole other thing. https://t.co/Dg2XVF0MvY
@CbusApril That was a service that delivered Foo Fighters albums. Poor business model. Didn't last long.
There's an Uber for food deliveries now. And I'm sad to announce that they don't call it Foodber.
Seriously, imagine a Prince hologram being used on stage to accompany Justin Timberlake's halftime show...in MINNEAPOLIS...and *anything* good coming from that. The closest I can come to imaging it is if JT points to Hologram Prince &amp; says, "Hahaa see y'all? I brought sexy back!" https://t.co/kotayQ2c6k
@Diego24fps @EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates Ellipses! hahaa THAT's what the 3 dots thing is called. Thank you. I'm glad I already gave the caveat that I'm a dumdum.
@EpicBeardMen @BDolanSFR @SFRupdates So glad they got rid of the downward arrow icon. Why be intuitive in 2018?
If you're dumb like me and don't know how to download free tracks on SoundCloud, I just figured it out. Hover over the icon that has 3 dots on the right side of each track &amp; you'll see the option. üß† @EpicBeardMen present: #UnJustified #ManOfThePeckerwoods https://t.co/7htZyF7ppC https://t.co/H1blC4c59d

@Mimic913 I love every time people remind me of that phrase. I'm going to turn this into an epic chorus. @EpicBeardMen
