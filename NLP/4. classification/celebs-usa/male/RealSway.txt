I appreciate your passion for rap.  I encourage you to actually learn about the ‚ÄúCULTURE‚Äù  as a whole and learn about B-Boy/Girls , Dj, Graph Art, history  etc.  otherwise the conversation about ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù is just about rap and limited.  Hesddd to the bay. IM OUT.  LOVE YALL!
Agreed and if you‚Äôre really invested you can separate the difference on your own terms.  Me offering people opportunity comes from a time when folks wouldn‚Äôt offer KingTech and me any.  I don‚Äôt just do this because a person is dope or not.  My calling is unique to me. https://t.co/mwXsIBGra4
Yeah but this isn‚Äôt the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs anymore where your only outlets are corporate ran platforms.  People are just lazy if you can‚Äôt find music you love. Independent artist packing venues and monetizing their on music more than ever. Just gotta dig https://t.co/z92IheZYpA
I don‚Äôt believe that.  We don‚Äôt all define ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the same way.  There‚Äôs TONS of great music out there.  Most folks I know don‚Äôt dig. I do.  You choose what you listen to. If you find what you like and SUPPORT then you will fill ur life with joy. https://t.co/pi3hsW180x
You guys sound like rappers who think that you‚Äôre better than people who got an opportunity.  So J, why don‚Äôt you create your own platform and you can put whoever you think deserves it. I‚Äôm fine with how I run mine. https://t.co/3a7nACYeeB
All love https://t.co/Mnip3vjv5a
Let me rephrase my response.  Yeah, you‚Äôre right. Just because you‚Äôre on my show doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre dope but it means that you will have have an opportunity to showcase your talent.  Danny, what‚Äôs dope to you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs dope to all.  Most of you dont support anyway https://t.co/g5qwiertfU
