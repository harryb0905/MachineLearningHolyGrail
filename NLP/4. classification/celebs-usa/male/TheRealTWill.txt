Don't tell half truths and expect trust when the full truth comes out. Half truths are no better than lies......
Cuddled Up With Mrs... @CallHerHelen Watching Movies.... Trying To Get Me Some......Lol
Thank God for what you have, Trust God for what you need.....PRAYER HELPS
Dear Twitter, sometimes I need more than 140 characters to describe what's on my mind. Sincerely, everyone.....
I trust God with my Life... after all He gave it to me....
In life, you're going to be left out, talked about, lied to, and used, but you have to decide who's worth your tears and who's not!!!!!
Dear whoever is reading this, you are beautiful and perfect in every way.Smile, because you're too amazing to be sad. Stay Strong. God Care
Grudges are a waste of perfect happiness. Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can't change....
The only person you should try to be better than, is the person you were yesterday.....
Sometimes you have to do what's best for you and your life, not what's best for everybody else.....
Never let the sadness of your past and the fear of your future ruin the happiness of your present.....
I'm sorry, but your opinion &amp; thoughts of me doesn't define the kind of person I am......Sorry
#OnTheReal There's always a reason to smile....find it . . .... Go
Remember those who helped you up, &amp; never forget those that put you down.....
Yield signs to potholes. Brake lights to the 101. Left hand, 4th finger a smile away from me. 58 miles to relaxation... RoadTrip...
It's nice to have someone in your life who can make you smile even when they're not around.....
1 Corinthians 13:13 -- And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.......
Forgive someone because you believe they are truly sorry, not just because you want to keep them in your life.....
Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, or tomorrow but eventually.....
Sometimes people say or do things to try &amp; bring you down, but all it really does is make you more determined than ever. If they only knew..
A good life is when you assume nothing, do more, need less, smile often, dream big, laugh a lot and realize how blessed you are..I AMBLESSED
Grey Mist. Drizzle Of Rain Drops. Wind Roars Anger Of A Lion. Cuddled To A Kiss. Movies To The Credits...Ending...NightTime...
Admit your weakness, God will add strength. The Lord doesn't like arrogance but he will empower the humble....AMEN
I love photos because they never change EVEN when the person in it changes......
I love those random memories that make me smile no matter what is going on in my life right now...... Have A Good Day......
Impossible is just a word thrown around It's possible to have the possibility To go beyond measure of what  Is not possible just Go for it
Sky's Dark. Sparkle Of Stars. Frost Ice Shines. Frogs Sounds Ignore My Listening. Dogs Stare. Hunger Sets.  Yea That's Night Time....
Just because someone loves you, doesn't mean they aren't capable of hurting you &amp; making mistakes.....
Sometimes you have to forget what you feel and remember what you deserve.....
Don't cry over the past, it's gone. Don't stress about the future, it hasn't arrived. Live in the present and make it beautiful.....
Sometimes you never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory, that you wish you could experience again....What Do U Value??
Respect people who find time for you in their busy schedule. But love people who never look at their schedule when you need them......whoop
Even if you lie to me once, it makes me question everything else you say......Truth
Dont think too much. About a situation  Youll create a problem that wasnt even there in the first place.....
I love when people remember the small things you thought they'd forget... that makes them even more special.....
Just a side note out of my  night, I love you @callherhelen even tho your in the next room, it's just a reminder...now back to your day
People say everything happens for a reason, but it would be nice to know some of the reasons why......?......Just A Thought...
Without bad experiences, you won't appreciate how much life shouldn't be taken for granted.....Cherish Life
Thought for today! If you're absent from my struggle, then don't be present for my success!!!........
My soul finds rest in God alone: My salvation comes from Him.                                         - Psalms 62:1
I need to stop worrying about the future and be thankful for what I've been blessed with so far........
" They Talk Behind My Bit** Back They Must of Seen Her A** Then "
I don't want a relationship where people say, 'They look so cute together.' I want one where they say, 'Look how happy they are together.''
A real man never stops trying to show a girl how much she means to him, even after he's got her.......Whoop
Watching movies with my fiancé @callherhelen....Nothing Could Be More Perfect...
Im not a perfect person, I make a lot of mistakes... but still, I love those people who stay with me after knowing how I really am....
Don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. What you won't do, someone else will.....
Every Woman deserves a man that will look at her each &amp; every day like it was the first time he laid his eyes on her....
Just know, ONE lie can ruin a thousand truths......
When you got something good, you hold on....
I miss Sacramento Kings games... #kingsAllDay
