@_ZachariahRay_ @dhenry75 @KStateMBB @KState I’m sorry, but in re reading my tweet I can’t find the word(s) ‘we’re classier than you.’ I certainly don’t condone the fu chant and wish we’d stop. But maybe we just don’t know how  to since we’re just a bunch of ‘hay seed, cow tippin’, crop dustin’ hicks out there at silo tech’
@morgan_murphy @KStateMBB I feel like i still owe you 20 for something tho
@mdpeck @KStateMBB @Chiefs I love that we have common ground.
@dhenry75 @KStateMBB I was celebrating MY team, not trashing YOURS, but thank you for reminding me why I chose @Kstate in the first place.
That was pleasing to my eyes. @KStateMBB #emaw

@TexLex @ChiefsReporter @dustincolquitt2 Or ‘Dustin and Chiefs can’t Colquitt each other’
Could have gone here:  ‘He wasn't born in Kansas City LIKE ERIC STONESTREET WAS and who, when hearing the news of @dustincolquitt2’s signing, was particularly excited.’ - i have no idea if that’s punctuated correctly. I’ll just stick to acting. I’m out. https://t.co/Uzhmo3oaqr
@rufusjonz @KStateMBB Not sure about that excuse. We had identical free throw %’s. We on the other hand, didn’t have our best player, fouled out 3, never were behind by more than 1, and lead the game for 34+ min. But ya, lucky win I guess. You guys were pesky though and way better than a 5 seed.
Congrats @KStateMBB. What a gritty win against the Wildcats of Kentucky. Way to make all us Wildcats of Kansas proud. Now on to the Ramblers of Illinois. #emaw #sister👖

Or jealously. GO FOOTBALL!  I LOVE FOOTBALL!! Lol hahaha lol hahahahahahaha lol
Resentment
With not one ounce of bitterness
It doesn’t matter that my team, the Kansas City Chiefs beat both Super Bowl contestants during the regular season. That’s not how football works. Championship teams peek when it matters the most. Therefor, I will politely cheer and golf clap each of these championship teams on.
I along with many of you will be taking in the American football game commonly referred to as the Super Bowl this afternoon. As I personally have no dog in the fight, I will remain neutral and simply root for a competitive and spirited contest without injury or poor officiating.
Fun times with @RalphGarman https://t.co/hkS6dgIGcq
Ya ya I know. Rock Chalk. Still love MY university more. Congrats KU. I’m just glad a Kansas team won on Kansas day.🌻🌻

@CydneyBarber GD he’s handsome
@LoganNagle No god please no. I beg you
@URNotAsCoolAsMe Again, a real trooper here. I tried to take the childish joke away from the likes of you in my tweet, (which said nothing derogatory about KU,btw) but you sir, were determined to show how unfunny and unoriginal you could be. Tip of the hat.
@samgutierrez_ @BryantNewby Oh because I’m crying and since you’re predicting a ku win tonight you think that’s what I’ll be doing tomorrow?
@BryantNewby GREAT https://t.co/pS1iyXvefw

@therealheatherk Heather you should take your comedy on the road!!! Don’t deprive America any longer.
@KeefePat Well this may be a hard concept for you to understand based on that attempt of humor, but I wanted Cam to be from Missouri so we could make fun of Missouri and NOT MY home state of Kansas.
@GrandPrincess41 Coordinate with other fans so there aren’t like 12,528 of them! Thank you!
@big_chiefD Good one.
@big_chiefD I attempted to take the obvious joke away from you yet you still persevered to show your 4th grade sense of humor! Congrats! Go Royals!

@DannyZuker @chalkhills2 I put ‘an’ instead of ‘a!!!’ How have the assholes of twitter not lit me up for this punishable by death typo!?!
@chalkhills2 An @DannyZuker episode.
@DBatch65 Originally scene was set in a grocery store and Cam offered to buy the lady who said cream puffs cat food.
@aladaniel0920 That was the first time the producers heard how loud and high pitched i could scream
@BudgePatti If you watch that episode, i tried my best to NEVER make direct eye contact with the actor that played the little slugger.
@6secondsintime Not a ton of ad lib. The scripts are pretty tight, but that’s not to say writers/producers aren’t open to ideas from all and sometimes those make it in the show. The words motivate the emotions and reactions.
@StephenWhistler Aubrey’s REAL mom plays the waitress!
@denahopkins I set the book up like a teeter totter. One half hanging over the edge of the ottoman and chips on the other end. Hit with my elbow and BOOM.
@jayhawk7615 Dr played by the great Suzy Nakamura. Second city alum. Also, actress playing Lilly then could NOT stop crying. Poor thing. A lot of that scene is a fake baby
@booegorilla Moment at end with ty and me was and ad on scene in the moment
@whollno One of the rare times Cam tucked his shirt in
@carolynewilson I remember Aubrey laughing and not really knowing why she was laughing but just because everyone else was

Writers idea for me to notice my shirt kinda matched the drapes in the bedroom scene. Re watch. A great example of how it’s an all hands on deck to make the show as funny as we can at every step https://t.co/Ltr5XZagr4
The hardest we ALL have laughed in a episode. @SofiaVergara saying hahahah and ed killed us every time! https://t.co/u7S0Kg27n8
@reeber93 It took me a while to say keifth without laughing
If you watch that episode you will see me hurt my foot outside the restaurant https://t.co/jb612o9nsn
@KatieKlutzkk My fav fall by far
Steve Levitan put that in the episode because he heard me telling a story using that voice on set one day https://t.co/kHxZ3cd77K

@MelissaNewton98 I asked specifically for the orange kimono
@SIcomMike I wanted that to be a callback to ‘i swear to god I’m gonna break the window’ from locking Lilly in the car
@SamSuch_ I took me 5 times to knock it in
@alex_zrmno It was cold for la standards that night
@henweb I didn’t wanna rehearse that scene so i could stay naturally off the beat as best i could. Written by @DannyZuker
In celebration of our 200th episode of Modern Family, tweet me your favorite Mitch and Cam scene or Cam moment and I’ll tell you something behind the  scenes-y about it, if i can remember anything-y
It was never in my wildest dreams that I’d be on a Tv show for 200 episodes. Tonight, the 200th airs. I’m very appreciative and thankful for FOX studios, ABC, Steve, and Chris for giving me my opportunity to make you all laugh and for helping me surpass my wildest dreams. https://t.co/2SRsFCV8sm

And there it is folks. These two @espn commentators just set a new world record for number of times ‘Chip Kelly’ has been said in a broadcast.
Merry Christmas. I hope you all have a day filled with laughter, food, and fun. I hope you’re surround by your family and friends. If you’re struggling this year, are alone, or are without a loved one for the first time, this is a special Merry Christmas wish just to you.

I'm in PR for a major American automotive brand  https://t.co/T6OViq8Jq8
Folks we have a winner! 2nd friendly guy out chatted and out friendlied 1st friendly guy. https://t.co/gvj2PaMriR
1st guy getting something from the overhead compartment
Hold....hold....we may have a development.
2nd guy had it out with his boss wed. and told him, hey I can go to 10 other places and do this job and NOT have to put up with YOUR crap!
Follow up question was, mostly for work or pleasure? Both travel mostly for work.
2nd friendly guy asked 1st if he travels a lot. He does. 1st asks 2nd same question. And he does too.
1st friendly guy's first job was cooking burgers at a diner. 2nd guys was delivering ice.
I do love Wendy's
1st friendly guy got a banana as a snack. 2nd declined a snack because he just grabbed a bite at Wendy's.
2nd friendly guy as never been but an uncle in his wife's family went and said it was great. 2nd guy says his dream vacation is a safari.
1st friendly guy has plans to travel to Bavaria soon.
2nd friendly fella not backing off. doubles down with story of co worker who had double knee replacement and got staff but doing well now
So far first friendly guy is winning. Already asked how many kids other guy has &amp; told him he was recovering from a knee replacement in Dec.
A super chatty friendly guy on my flight just had an even more super chatty friendly guy sit down next to him. WHO will win this chat off?!?

I said what kind of chip is more important than watching your son WITH your son on his TV show. She said tortilla
She said, who's talking back at u on there? I said no one. She said well I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I wanted a chip.
Now she said, she's seen this one 5 times and getting a snack. She said, watch yourself by yourself.
