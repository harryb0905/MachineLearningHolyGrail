Good luck to everyone watching the Oscars tonight!
Sneak peak at my new @TVGuideMagazine cover! https://t.co/cG0s0jeoQR
Observation: many polarizing politicians actually LIKE each other, privately help each other, then publicly stir the pot, playing for votes. That’s fine. Only thing wrong with it is when we buy it whole cloth, breeding intolerance, anger and total inability to laugh at ANYTHING.
I deleted my Elizabeth Warren tweet. It was a joke and some peeps got upset, and that’s never my intention.  On the GOOD side: I just got to use the Oxford comma!
Good for you, Sean!! #Truth https://t.co/9WE4RFjduw
This show is SO fun. And the game is addicting. https://t.co/qvc8c8QQwM
Was always an honor to see Frank at Laker games. Legend and class act. https://t.co/tXufAREezC
And this movie could NEVER be made today. https://t.co/u877lwpony
Thanks man. Do you have a place for my wife and co to stay in Tuscon? https://t.co/cgoNPIA5US
Wow. Single women traveling together to @JWMarriott  hotels should READ THIS! https://t.co/TisMygMg9k
Wow!! Never thought of that! Figured it was just abject incompetence. #gross @JWMarriott https://t.co/5wftqsvmbo
⁦@JWMarriott⁩ Tuscon offered to comp this meal after losing 3 reservations, cramming them into one room, and kicking my wife and her party out of THAT room just now! #gross #avoid https://t.co/h0T5j1GmUM
@JWMarriott Tucson just kicked my wife out of her room because they are “overbooked.” She made the reservations SIX months ago. Room service had mold AND hair in the meal. Also construction men ON her balcony in the am!! Avoid this hotel please.
This is the worst time of year for sports.
Wow. This is fantastic.  We have nothing like this anymore. What a time that was! https://t.co/SSwyGKEtd3
The opening sentence of this piece might be the greatest of all time in entertainment journalism. https://t.co/jEbgnr5hN7
No, Parker; it’s not. Fart noises and pretension deserve each other. https://t.co/HaIGDTAnQI
Congrats to the GOATS, BB and TB12.  No words to describe their dominance and legacy. Rams hopefully learned a lot and will be back!! #SuperBowLIII
Ballgame.
EXactly!! https://t.co/6LFJION5ds
This is the Superbowl. There is NO excuse. He will never live this down if he doesn’t contribute in this game. Never. https://t.co/qES8F15Eqe
Let’s GOOOOOOOO!!!
The NFL refs are at it again!
The best thing about watching #SuperBowl2019 in London? They don’t show the insufferable Super Bowl ads.
YES!!!! Youngsters THAT is how it’s done. #nationalAnthem
Awake in London. Let’s go @RamsNFL #SuperBowl2019
I did. In Ohio for the Big Red Machine Reds and then LA for Showtime Lakers. https://t.co/n1irvMVmsE

In that old disco song “You make my love come down!” What the hell were they talking about? I don’t understand the anatomy.
It’s kinda fascinating to watch Howard Schultz being bullied out of running for president.
Good talk! https://t.co/HOYPKsnqmr
Why do the backgrounds of the all the celeb interviews from  Sundance look like an even more depressing version of the “Friends” set?
I just saw a very fancy play and the actors had to actually tell the audience when it was over. Not sure how I feel about that. #FirstTimeForEverything
“I was in The Getaway!” “I was in Network!” “And I was in Hud! WTF are we doing in this?!” #everyonegigssometime https://t.co/FI2nx6KfBF

The GOAT, Tom Brady, proves once again, never underestimate the Power Of The Pretty-Boy.
I love that the LA/Boston rivalry is back. @MLB @NFL
Hell YES! https://t.co/hyzAotAKDp
Wow. Wow. @RamsNFL had a gift from the refs and they opened it!
This is all you can ask for. The chance to take your team to the Super Bowl.  @JaredGoff16
Joyner play might have cost us the season. That floater should never have been a completion. #rams
Rams!!!!! Who THEY?!!!
Let’s GO!!!!!!! @RamsNFL yes!!!!!!
Might be going to sleep early. #ugly #rams
Like the @mentalsamurai promo? #NFCChampionshipGame #rams #saints
I need this @RamsNFL game to be a blowout (for the Rams) so I can get to sleep in time to wake up at 5 am. #London. I man can dream, right?

If you have to tell me to “wait for it” you have some BS at the beginning that I won’t wait for.
Movie trailers that over-explain the film’s concept are the BEST.
Thanks! If you’re being asked to do the Oscars (and at this point you may be) read this. https://t.co/2rx3IFN0pf
The peeps who created “Ninja Warrior” and I came up with this. It is SO fun. (And hard). Get ready! https://t.co/gO3ZQg3fj4
Do you really need to ask? https://t.co/7QqsYp92I1
Without question, the greatest thing about “Bird Box” are all of the new memes.
Great interview about a great show (and sometimes friendly rival to my old show). BTW, anyone who hated that final scene is a moron, IMHO https://t.co/X2jzU4d5XY
It’s FlacoTime!! #Chargers #Ravens
Go get ‘em Bradley. #GoldenGlobes
Taxiing to take off from LAX to London. I think we might be driving there.
Those consistently broken, 90’s technology, multi-colored light tubes at LAX don’t exactly scream “entertainment and visual effects capital of the world”.
Were you surprised to learn that I’ve been living #lowcarb for years? That’s because @AtkinsInsider allows me to eat fresh, healthy and delicious foods so I can live well and feel great. Retweet if you love #lowcarb! #TodaysAtkins #ad https://t.co/bDUfDPRfnG

I’ve been saying for years that the @Dodgers lacked a true badass. Hugging and kissing in the dugout is fine, but it’s time for some Kirk Gibson fire. Now we have it. https://t.co/Mv8LUebQvF
Not surprised. Asking people who lost their homes and everything they owned in a fire PG&amp;E may have caused to PAY for the fire. #OnlyInCalifonia https://t.co/OuqPkh07VM
You truly know you are in London when you see the Queen’s helicopter fly by your window while you’re in the bath.
Theresa May for Oscar host? She may be available!
Thanks! @TheAcademy It’s CLEARLY time to “Boldly go where no man has gone before!” https://t.co/qvKgb2f8uC
Eddie would be honored. Also, he already has an Oscar! @TheAcademy https://t.co/Of3zaIGl6q

All this Oscar talk got me thinking. My favorite movie last year didn’t even get NOMINATED. If you didn’t see “Wind River”, please do so. @Renner4Real gave the best performance of the year and.. nada.
Also, the Trivago guy might be a good candidate. @TheAcademy
@TheAcademy The Trivago guy would also be good.
Hey @TheAcademy Ron Burgundy should host. At this point, you better pull the trigger.
Billy Gibbons in the house! Maybe the choir should’ve taken a crack at “Pearl Necklace”.  #41Funeral
“This Is My Country” Wow. #41stpresident Texas is doing him proud.
Alan Simpson. Mike drop. #GeorgeHWBushFuneral
I loved this in the day. Hasn’t aged well. VERY pedestrian shots of running. And what is Mark Fydrich doing? He’s literally staggering. https://t.co/tYOT828xEw

William Goldman’s work made me fall in love with movies (Butch Cassidy, Marathon Man, All The President’s Men). His books taught me about writing and navigating showbusiness, which will never be the same without him. He was a true legend.
In the US, over 65 million unpaid #caregivers provide assistance to a loved one who is disabled, ill, or aged. Nov is #NationalFamilyCaregiversMonth - time to take care of yourself, too! Take the #EmbracingCarers quiz. I support #caregivers, do you? https://t.co/CcyFkB6YRJ

Why do so many classic songs end with an extended fade out? Did no one want to write an ending? They just let the dude at the mixing board slowly turn a dial when he’d heard enough?

If I DO coach the Raiders for a 100 mill and an expectation to win 1 out of every 8 games, I will bring my Lowe family Turkey Bowl classic audible: “Sweet Sandra Bullock! Sweet Sandra Bullock!” @JaredGoff16
Also: I am available and VERY capable of coaching the Oakland Raiders to a 1-8 record for 100 million dollars.

I hope your right, for his sake . I’m sure he’s a nice guy, too. But there’s no coming back from that kind of performance when it matters.  Anyone can “streak” in August. https://t.co/fFImlfl1PQ

My family and I lived on both Dume Drive and Wandermere, the two streets most devastated by the fire. Heartbroken for those affected.
So much of my childhood played out in the homes of Point Dume. Literally, all my teen years.  I was even evacuated to Zuma in the ‘78 fire. This devastation is surreal to see. Especially from London, so far from home.  Sending love.
The market in my old neighborhood of Point Dume in Malibu. God help them. https://t.co/moDBNeEXvk

Congratulations to the best team in baseball @RedSox on a deserved championship. With some changes, maybe the @Dodgers will take it from you next year!
At a baseball game but hard to enjoy it. My heart breaks for Pittsburgh. So vile.  So sad.
Kershaw used as a PINCH HITTER in our 18 inning 7+ hour win! ⁦@Dodgers⁩ ⁦@MLB⁩ https://t.co/OZRUOsgn6t
Discussing a baseball replay at the World Series with Sandy Koufax is surreal. @Dodgers #14thInning
What’s trending on Twitter is the new Nielsen ratings. I simply believe they are both rigged and full of s**t.
I will LITERALLY  be waving the flag to welcome my @Dodgers back to Dodger stadium.
Class. https://t.co/R1qtI90r0C
I think Boston looks like a good team.
Dude. These @RedSox are not fooling around. #Respect
Shooting on set while trying to watch the #Worlds2018 game 1 is a seriously stressful juggling act.
I truly cannot imagine two teams I would rather see in the World Series or two stadiums I would rather watch them play in. Good luck to all, but go @Dodgers
Go Blue. https://t.co/KlSFRgNME0
It was an honor.  Thank you. https://t.co/RWAFVsV9BW

John Smolts after Barnes gets a hit and game tying RBI: “He might not be the most talented hitter”. Sheesh! #nlcs @Dodgers
I also very much appreciate seeing the phrase “aerial coverage” over footage of aerial coverage. #NeedTheInfo #NLCS2018
Joe Buck is a pal, but good golly, he and Smoltz CANNOT stop praising the Brewers. Might be time for an equal time rule. @Dodgers

This looks AMAZING. https://t.co/FVdNf4KaUo

Was just told that #TheBadSeed has now been seen by over 9 million people. Thank you all!
Goff looks like he will be the biggest star QB for the Rams since Warren Beatty.  Go @RamsNFL !!!!
When was the law passed that a great football throw had to be referred to as a “dime”?
The pace of this @Dodgers game is inexcusable. The umps need to tell the pitchers to speed it up. Wasn’t there a new pitch clock?
If you look closely at any news headline on ANY site/channel you will always find a word that tips the site/channel’s bias and agenda. Impossible to find a neural, facts only headline today.
“We didn’t start the fire” and “Life is a rock (but the radio rolled me)”. One is pretentious. One is SO good! You can choose which. https://t.co/wg8Yn2bRaW
Songs where someone sings lists of things are either amazing, or just absolutely horrible.
It is no secret around @MLB that Joe West is a old-time showboat who often gets it wrong. Like tonight. @Dodgers
Unreal. Best story in sports in years, BY FAR. He’s back and I love it. #Tiger

I should really figure out how to drop a diss track.

I did the exact same things as you when I was your age.
Was proud to write this scene for these two great actors to face off. #TheBadSeed
Face to face. They meet.  Seed vs OG Seed! #TheBadSeed
Behold, the original Bad Seed. Patty McCormick! #TheBadSeed
You’re so welcome. Thanks for your great work. Chloe is a CLASSIC. https://t.co/TuutbXmWGq
We changed the character of the caretaker to a nanny when we change the story from a mother to a father.  Wanted the same weird tension from the book and original. #TheBadSeed
“Oh Emma.”
Than you. Peter Menzies was my DP. Amazing artist. https://t.co/RgSV9ZJ63I

My favorite scene. #PeePeePads
Emma does NOT like a potty-mouth. #TheBadSeed
I have a feeling these wasps are gonna be a thing. #TheBadSeed
Lotta effort to get that train! #TheBadSeed
She has the acting chops of a full grown leading lady. And she just turned 12. https://t.co/6TCRb50UvF

Gonna be on @GMA coming up this morning . If you’re awake.

Also: in a song with such specific details, why do they not know where the ship was coming from? (Coming back from “some mill” in Wisconsin.) Should’ve been easy enough to find out.
I think it’s sad that “the old cook” was unable to serve his meal in “The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald”.

It’s not everyday your tweet gets a headline in @Variety !! https://t.co/RrQonUnyX3
Seriously, this “best pop movie” category is the worst idea the Academy has had since they asked me to sing with Snow White.
The film business passed away today with the announcement of the “popular” film Oscar. It had been in poor health for a number of years. It is survived by sequels, tent-poles, and vertical integration.
Um, nope. But I know iit must be shocking for you when an actor can just, for a moment, not talk of themselves and honor another. https://t.co/UM1egS8TPZ
Redford made it look too easy. He was too subtle and too good-looking to be an acting awards darling.  (Like Cary Grant, but with way more range) It’s a shame.
WAIT!!! I forgot The Way We Were! (Put it in the middle of the list)
In honor of my hero Robert Redford’s retirement, here are my favorites of his films: Butch Cassidy, The Natural, Three Days Of The Condor, The Sting, All The President’s Men, Electric Horseman.  What an unparalleled run he’s had.
Unfortunately, this should be taken with a mound of salt. There as been no official outreach to the show runner. Easier for them to give this non-specific, fuzzy quote than explain why they cancelled a well respected and well rated show. https://t.co/oUNG8FsLpQ
I can hear lions outside my tent tonight. Unreal. #serengeti

Listening to LeBron presser. When he says his kids will play a role in where he goes next, it sounds like he wants to be a Laker.
@stephenasmith with the truth bombs tonight. @espn
Kind of amazing that the @cavs make it to the finals and everyone but LeBron earns the right to hear how “bad” they are as a team.
Congratulations to my great pal Peter Guber and Steve Kerr. DYNASTY.  @warriors
@JeanieBuss Re: next year. I hope you’re watching this game. (And reading my tweets).
No way Jordan or Magic or Kobe lose by 20 on their home court on the way to being swept in the #NBAFinals. No way. Not ever.
Never met Anthony Bourdain, but I  felt like he was my friend. I loved his work.

It was the same mindset that led to the horrible original release version of the film. The Outsiders: The Complete Novel” is the REAL movie. https://t.co/KKnE7Vaivb
Wait!! This movie is coming out in a month and they’re still looking for actors?? I. Don’t. Get. It.
Kareem was great in “Airplane!”  I think he’s their guy.
Ah. Okaaay. But they need a basketball player as his co star? Is that it? (I WILL get to the bottom of this) https://t.co/RTmpOOu1XU
Well he’s clearly auditioning these days. https://t.co/5QbM1dcjlN
I mean, I am pretty sophisticated about movies (and commercials for that matter) and I’m lost.
I mean, do I need to call my agent? Is this a real movie with Manu Ginobli? I think I might be a better. Not sure.
Can someone please explain these NBA player/Denzel Washington ads about a “sequel he won’t be in, but WILL be in the commercials about not being in it” concept? What is this??
This looks bad for Cleveland. Maybe LeBron should change into those suit shorts. #CavsVsWarriors
This will never get old for me. Not ever. #inspired https://t.co/J414vdvPbI

Keep at it, kid!! https://t.co/yv4iQEELC7
Right?! Same with the Jags and Panthers in the NFL. Like the teams in “Any Given Sunday”.  #MiamiMountains vs #LosAngelesQuake https://t.co/I4nhBU2C5I
Both of these teams look like they’re in a movie about baseball that didn’t get the rights to use real MLB uniforms #WildCardGame
The @Dodgers will beat either of these teams. #WildCardGame
Why so many empty seats behind home plate in this game? #Yankees
“All rise” #yankees
Yikes!! Yankees.
LOVE seeing Alex Smith do well. #49ers  #MondayNightFootball
Tom Petty was on my Mount Rushmore of rock heroes. The writing, the voice, the band. HeartBROKEN.
Sickened, shocked and sad. Praying for everyone in Vegas.
Heartbroken for Vegas. Praying for the families.

Dear Internet, If you need to use the disclaimer "wait for it", I won't.
LAX is the most incompetently run airport in the world.
Tony Romo is crushing it in the @NFLonCBS booth. Smartest by FAR and giving Nance (who I like) some MUCH needed energy and sense of fun.
I'll take these stats. https://t.co/PT9ANeRlTQ
Yep. Shooting new season now. #CodeBlack https://t.co/M7x9A2VgJc
Love it. https://t.co/SCnvjY5pvB
My boys and I are about to introduce @coldplay at #iHeartFestival #legends
Also, very gutsy of the Rams to let Ryan Seacrest coach the team. #ThursdayNightFootball
Now, if the @RamsNFL would finally get rid of that terrible ram logo on their sleeves. Bring back the "horns". #ThursdayNightFootball
People have NO IDEA what common, dangerous safety issue is. Mostly for crew members. #FixIt https://t.co/SWUVKNB1vM
So happy to see the @RamsNFL have clearly turned a corner. Keep it going! #LAfootball

Frank Vincent died today. He was in one of my favorite scenes in the history of movies. "Goodfellas": "Now go get your shine box."
Let's just say that any "Outsiders" fan should not miss it. #TheLoweFiles https://t.co/5YBG6VZ6ir
ONE more next week. A one hour (!) where we visit the Outsiders set and look for the "Wood Ape". Saved the best for last. #TheLoweFiles https://t.co/odHgpHj3rp

It is. https://t.co/7JRP397dkd
This was hard to watch. #TheLoweFiles
I sincerely hope @Sheryl_Lowe is not watching tonight's episode. Because when Johnowen does his fear experiment she will freak. FREAK!
"Jaunty"!  One of my favorite words! https://t.co/sljqvnO71A
Also, it was absolutely freezing in this prison. #TheLoweFiles
The "drop room" was no joke. Absolutely frightening. #TheLoweFiles
I am very serious about this "gallows" drinking game. I hope you are all participating!
Our high top game is particularly strong in this episode. #TheLoweFiles
It's hard to believe that inmates were actually caged like this at one point in our country. #TheLoweFiles

Hope you enjoyed the show. Sasquatch was fun. We hunt the Wood Ape in our season finale, and the sh**t really goes down. #TheLoweFiles
This is one of the reasons why I'm glad @Sheryl_Lowe was not on our adventure. She would have made me take @RealMatthewLowe home! #HurtFoot
The legend is a very real, tangible part of their history and daily life. #TheLoweFiles
The conversation with those amazing First People was extraordinary and beautiful. #TheLoweFiles
How do you say it? Sauce-quatch or Sas-quatch?? #TomatoTomahto
Have you seen this guy? We are on the hunt TONIGHT. #TheLoweFiles on @AETV https://t.co/mrjhZYCEjM

There was a lot of tension in the control room when the ROV got tangled. Very expensive equipment. #TheLoweFiles

Which Lowe do you think will have the most luck?
Part of the fun of making this show was learning paranormal theories.
That "I'm a little teapot" commercial is scarier than anything you will see on this show
OK, it's about to get real. Everything you are about to see really happened. There are no editing tricks, or special effects. #TheLoweFiles
That shaman juice is no joke! #TheLoweFiles
Do we believe that any of this equipment is actually on the up and up? #TheLoweFiles

A though: actors/musicians don't "reinvent" themselves. Some are just able to last long enough that you are able to see their diversity.

"Won't Get Fooled Again" into "Let's Go @Dodgers" may be the best use of an organ in all of #baseball

I'm not joking. Bring in Pence! He knows all about upsets. Oh, wait, he left the stadium with the rest of the fans. #Colts #Jets #MNF
Maybe Woody should start Mike Pence at QB in second half. #jets #colts
This season, and this game in particular, disprove the adage "On any given Sunday". Never seen less parity. #NFL #Jets #Colts

West coast. If you want to be reminded that we are not as divided as folks would have is believe, #CodeBlack starts at 10 on CBS.
Was a trick #WestWing question. Both Sam and Leo always wore full suits. I'd heard Reagan did, and followed "suit". #RespectTheOffice
Quiz for #WestWing fans: What character ALWAYS kept his jacket on in the Oval Office, as a sign of respect? And what POTUS did the same?
