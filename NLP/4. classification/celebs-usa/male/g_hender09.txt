@WarrenBScott8 @RealJakeHyman We woulda smoked them buddy!
@MichelleGungorn Congratulations!
@CJMcCollum 🔥🔥🔥
@carmballer @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA They don’t know what to expect from them in playoffs. They should look to deal them and see what they can get. If they want to win NOW
@JaredMuchow @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Only one I can’t answer. I’ve played with too many too have a favorite. But the best teammate I’ve ever had by far is Marvin Williams. Best dude on earth
@coaler14 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Playing rock band with my teammates after a few libations 👀 @JonScheyer sucked at every instrument and singing!
@DominicSwindler @NdotSmitty @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA @JonScheyer That’s an even worse matchup!
@sportsfan314 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA 👀 from time to time
@NdotSmitty @DominicSwindler @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA 🙄 smh. The Donald Trump era #Fakenews
@T_RavP13 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Because they win 1, lose 1. Win 2, lose 2! All the top teams STREAK. Gotta play consistently to win BIG. They have the ability. Going to need multiple players to step up on road trip. Maybe when they are at full strength it will help the team at the end of the year
@carmballer @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA They need EXPERIENCE. I like their young players but if you’re really trying to make some noise you need guys that have been there before. Only a couple players on the team have really played in playoffs and are dependable. Doubt that team looks like it does right now in April.
@bleedblue1128 @NoahCoslov @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Longview, Carmel CC, Piper Glen, Quail
@alx_hdz00 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA 👀 always!
@trazzz123 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA I vaguely remember that. We had a tough group that year. Really together and hungry. It takes a lot to beat Golden State. In a game you have to win over and over again because they are never out of the game. They can score too well and can kick on defense too. Was a lot of fun!
@prophecy033 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Winning first round series against the @LAClippers and then competing against the eventual champs @warriors
@DominicSwindler @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA @NdotSmitty me and he knows it!
@contentforlife @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA @Dame_Lillard Off the bench
@contentforlife @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA @Dame_Lillard a catch and shoot MELO
@NoahCoslov @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA No doubt boss! Let’s tee it up!
@Alex_Be_Humble @blazersedge @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Possibly! I like their team though. @sdotcurry balling right now! Best in league shooting from 3
@blkoehler @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Ooooo. One of the best
@jenkvargo @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Virginia no doubt
@mdudas8 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Low score at blue bell is -3
@mdudas8 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Golf swing is weeaaak. Haven’t played much due to injury. Will get it back this upcoming summer
@obssdwithgerald @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA That’s tough   Kemba Glen Rice Mugsy  Alonzo Larry Johnson
@Stixsam @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Hip feeling great. Achilles not as much. Injured it 4 months ago but healing up well. Thanks for asking
@Maxiepoobear @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Wouldn’t rule that out as a possibility 😉
@Dylan_Ellett @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Love Beal but no telling that he’s a real winner yet. Malik can really score too. No saying that he would be a great fit w Kemba either
@blkoehler @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Can only answer that after national championship game
@IMG_98 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Crazy athlete. Loves to play. Needs more game experience. He will be a really good pro though. Think he has more skills than he’s showing right now
@JWong808 @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA 1 more STAR. Love Dame, CJ and Nurk but to go deep in playoffs they may need 1 more
@dukedoug @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Hill, Jay Williams, Battier, Laettner, Redick  Hurley, Dawkins, Brand, Irving, Ferry
@Updatesonben @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA Always a possibility. I’m sure it depends on how things go this month. This road trip coming up is HUGE for them. Need multiple players to step up. They are capable
@DahntaysDawg @DukeMBB @hornets @sixers @trailblazers @NBA No plans yet. Had a great time doing it last year though with @THANS50 stay tuned!

you can't have everything. be happy with what you have because what's right in front of u is enough...
@Elliott23Boi lol agree there too
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night. I don't care who wins, I just want to see a good game. the series has already been great.
I just don't see Lebron letting his team lose. especially in a championship game like this where EVERYTHING is on the line.....
they slow the game down and make it very physical and scrappy. with all that being said the heat have the best player in the world...
it's obviously gna be tough for the pacers. I'd give them a 35% chance of winning. their bigs have played so well along with Paul George...
what are the chances the pacers go into Miami and win tomorrow???
bout to see #afterearth #hype

@leakyroof02 nope
#Tiger wouldn't surprise me if he still wins the tournament. he's that good. in that game ANYTHING can happen!! QUICKLY!! #TheMasters
@feiertag20 me 2
@kgbrown05 didn't kno that. I'd like to kno how they determined penalty over disqualification.... I think cause he called himself on it....
@leakyroof02 he is but u kno I look up to Kob as well Yoc!
@Lark_NessMonsta no. he didn't use path for his dropped. decided to re hit the shot but dropped it too far from original shot
@darin_bauguss he didn't realize wat he was doing. happens all the time. if he did he wouldn't of signed his card
“@ghost10987: @GhJr09 talk about an unlucky 15th hole. Went from kick in birdie to triple bogey.” tru
@D_BPhotography yea that's the rule
I think the rule should say "one club length" from the original shot no closer to the hole to avoid the confusion #tiger
the ball accidentally rolling in the divot and ud have to play it as it lies...
possible to the previous shot. as a player how do u determine as near as possible?? ur not gna drop the ball near the divot to avoid...
#tiger he should be penalized for not following the rule. but the committee should look at the rule....it says drop the ball as near as...
#tiger gets two stroke penalty...
@leakyroof02 Kobe injury is a bigger deal
@Phil_BigP @cRoweGolf he could only drop straight back over the the hazard and that proly woulda been in the woods or rough somewhere
@Phil_BigP @cRoweGolf last shot or in a line straight back from the pin to the entry point. since that point was down the hill to the left..
@Phil_BigP @cRoweGolf since the ball went in from the other side of the hazard and off to the left he has to hit at the same spot he hit...
@cRoweGolf that may b it!
@Phil_BigP yea rule says u can go as far bak as u want. doesn't say u have to stop where u hit the last shot
say that u can't drop behind the original shots spot if that spot is in line with the pin and ball entry. didn't see where he dropped it tho
the last shot or in a line as far back as you want from the pin to the point where the ball crossed the hazard. it doesn't...
didn't see the telecast but don't believe #Tiger will get penalized for his drop. the rule gives u the option of dropping where you hit.....
@kobebryant praying for you bro
@benniuskellius nossir!
lol Jason Dufner got the fat lip in

@justplainaj not just okay but he doesn't even lose his job.... no sense
@justplainaj ...a basketball gym he would b arrested for assault. but because he's in a coaching/mentoring position it makes it okay?....
@justplainaj ...with it it was just after the fact which makes it less magnetized. if rice did anyone of those things outside....
@justplainaj I'm sure if some of that stuff came out while it was happening it would have been an issue.... he didn't get away.....
“@Joeflores11: @JonScheyer @ghjr09 #serialstage5er”ahahaah
