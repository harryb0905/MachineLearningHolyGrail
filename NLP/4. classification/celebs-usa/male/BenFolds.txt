Music Therapy is incredible stuff. Expands our understanding of the brain. It‚Äôs scientific and sound. Effective. Autism, stokes, aphasia. DO look into it. It‚Äôs the future. https://t.co/psKIFlZt26
@JRhodesPianist @amandapalmer No way! I‚Äôve been wearing your new album out ‚ÄúFuck Digital‚Äù @JRhodesPianist - I‚Äôll wait to publicly gush so we don‚Äôt make everyone ill. https://t.co/wIpmMIcvjA
Not that I‚Äôm biased. But I agree. https://t.co/Mb6bMD7ZF5
@AskTSA @marshmellowflow That‚Äôs the best reply
I travel nearly everyday in my work and always impressed with @TSA and their thankless gig (always handcheck my film). And today same. üëèüèº üëèüèº üëèüèº - sorry it‚Äôs taken the recent needless kerfuffle for us all to express gratitude.
Thileeeeee! I don‚Äôt think I could smile any harder! Nice üòÉ https://t.co/GovrAUnELE
@universalshow Mr. Maxwell! Was just listening to your music. Waving back.

@TheSpeedball @HarmonicTremble @jpar0 @theSuburbsUK @RoughTradeNYC @realgonemusic @dawestheband Sure. Is it used or new?
@TheSpeedball @HarmonicTremble @jpar0 @theSuburbsUK @RoughTradeNYC @realgonemusic @dawestheband What kind of turntable is it?  I SWEAR I‚Äôve been wanting to design a foolproof awesome sounding turntable for years.
@TheSpeedball @HarmonicTremble @jpar0 @theSuburbsUK @RoughTradeNYC @realgonemusic Well now that‚Äôs bizarre. It‚Äôs spot on on mine. If you can check your turntable speed with a strobe, that MIGHT be your problem. If the record was pressed at multiple facilities (not likely) then that could be.
Thanks Ethan!  While you‚Äôre on it look into some @caroshawmusic - who‚Äôs also singing here.  You‚Äôll be happy you did https://t.co/fKc6WymvKj

@amandapalmer a small tear rolled up out my eye
Who'd have thunk? You can put together a Ziggy Stardust costume out of women's bad officewear at TJ Maxx

@moni9896 @imogenheap aw thanks!  Always happy to be mentioned along with Imogen! Happy tweeting.
@DanWilsonMusic absolutely. You helped me kickstart the writing!
Right on! @shawnstockman done done and done!
@ZoZoRenee Enjoyed your week of wisdom. See you in Australia!
Do what moves you @pure_tone  Beatles records heavily compressed. Classical records not as much. Going to tape usually compresses naturally
I will now follow @JimmyWhitee for this next week
Way To Normal is heavily compressed - that was artistic decision. Compression is a musical tool  I have no policy @Christaphorac @pure_tone
‚Äú@CCiaravino: @BenFolds I am considering being you for haloween, any advice?‚Äù Yes, lots of blood and eye patch
New record is not a loud or overly compressed record - retains dynamics. Nearly no limiting or EQ in mastering too @pure_tone
I will be answering questions from the official @rhapsody account... gotta sign off from mine to do that.  See you there #BFFRhap
That's awful! @LarryCaines We just signed 1000 LPs last week. I shall pass this onto someone who can help.
@KarenElson_ The MEAN streets of Nashville
Hey! @KarenElson_  damn good to see you today!
I wanna know what you wanna know..tweet questions for me to #BFFRhap and follow @Rhapsody...I'll answer LIVE 10/19 at 4PM EST
this Friday I'll be tweeting LIVE from @Rhapsody at 4PM EST..if you got questions for me, tweet them to #BFFRhap now!!

@SirkSnilloc good question and I don't know.  I'll ask someone who does though
I only follow one person for a week at a time @karliere. Everyone else make sure she doesn't sleepwalk?
Now Alex you've been a featured singer in a video and done an interview! That doesn't make you random does it now? @alexkintzle @karliere
@DeannaAliano it's covered by your bangs. Stands for 'lady'?
I follow @karliere. Unless she walks off a cliff.
@Humandogfishy yes but I took a vote and the audience wished to be referred to that way. Sorry.
@ashleycambanjo one song on our new record is (our idea of) a total musical nod to Glen Campbell (&amp; Jimmy Webb)
@EthanAmerine yes! I'll check that out!
It's been a fine week of following @EthanAmerine Be well sir! I shall randomly choose someone new tomorrow.
