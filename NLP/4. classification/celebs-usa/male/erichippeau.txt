Tim Cook makes case for the KISS rule: one iPhone vs multiple Android devices. Who dominates? #ATD10
Tim Cook says he learned from Steve Jobs that focus is key in business and life. This applies to all our startups #ATD10 @lererventures
Wanted to say bombastic opening of #ATD10 by Jane Lynch.
Bombastic opening of #ATD10 followed by Tim Cook. Great start.
