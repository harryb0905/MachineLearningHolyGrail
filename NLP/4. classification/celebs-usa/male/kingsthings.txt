5) Spring training is almost here!
4) My favorite commercial was the #NFL commercial where all the players were tackling each other in the restaurant!
3) @tonyromo was terrific! He is the best color man in today's #NFL broadcasting line-up!
2) With that said, Bill Belichick designed one of the best defensive game plans I've ever seen. Kudos to him.
1) In this age of high offense #NFL, the game was disappointing. I like defense, but could have gone for a little more scoring.
I have a few reflections on the #SuperBowl...
That was a rousing #HalftimeShow!! I just wish I understood all the lyrics.

1) Why does any American need or want a semi-automatic rifle? It sure ain't for hunting.
For 60 yrs I've been asking ?'s to better understand people &amp; events. After the tragedy in #LasVegas, I have a few more I need answered...
