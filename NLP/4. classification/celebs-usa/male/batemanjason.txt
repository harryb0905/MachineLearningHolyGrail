GMA was fun this morning.  Looking forward to Fallon tonight.
Sorry, didn't mean to tweet that again.
Check this video out -- The Dancer http://youtu.be/8ztujyP65_o
I hope ths works 4 the Dumbdumb short... http://j.mp/djf6jh
The new Orbit short from Dumbdumb is up at YouTube. I'd post the link, but still dumb. Sorry.  It's called The Dancer. Hope you like it!
This is what good actors look like.  http://moby.to/ftgmvj
Been shooting HORRIBLE BOSSES for the last two weeks. This'll be worth more than your matinee money.
Arnett, thanks for honoring my privacy.  What time's dinner tonight?
Also, thanks for the kind words during my unexpected, unintended, thoroughly eye opening week's visit to Douchebag Land.
Thanks, gang!  Have a great 4th!
What does this sign mean in tweet land # and, what about this one &lt;3
@Alyssa_Milano No biggie, gone soon. Unlike the pain from Sunday's loss. Hope you're good.
Correction- If there were boos, I didn't hear them. If some were mad, I didn't see them. I wish I had. If you're out there, I'm sorry.
There wasn't one boo. Not one hiss. The Apple guy brought me in away from the paparazzi. Period. I was content in line. I wish I'd stayed.
I think dumbdumb is up on Facebook now. Not sure what the hell good that is but I hope you guys'll show me.
I hope this works -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59S-YaUvMIk&feature=youtube_gdata
Thanks to all of you who have supported the dumbdumb short!!! We're getting a lot of views!!!
Go to YouTube and check out the first short from dumbdumb! I'd post the link, but I'm dumb.
@arnettwill seems very not right.   @serafinowicz is beyond skilled at iPhone Scrabble
Shooting short #2 in the morning. Me playing "son", Jeffery Tambor playing "dad." Arnett's in London ☹. Wish I had a shirt with his smell.
Will and I are still shooting our first DumbDumb spot with @evilhag and @harrachael, although we can't remember (cont) http://tl.gd/19ji0e
Shot until 3:30am. More tonight. Me tie-tie. Worth it though. Arnett is a genius. I hope you all like it.
Today Arnett and I shoot our first day on our first digital short from our ad agency, DumbDumb. Early June, they should be on the web.
Arnett's pipes are so G-damn velvety on the GMC spots. He must gargle sand.
Recording voice over commercials for Verizon. I've almost swollowed my tongue twice.
Will Arnett and I are making three digital shorts for Wrigley! Very excited. Today we're scouting for a house to shoot in.
@arnettwill does this mean it just goes to you?
Good morning, England. It feels warm and safe against the bosoms of Mr. Pegg and Mr. Serafinowicz.
Oh, I just need to adjust the setting that sends an email to me when someone joins me.  Moment, please...

Hi. I'm new.
