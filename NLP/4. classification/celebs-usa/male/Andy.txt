@hochman great job last night - your auctioneering was especially impressive !
@MonicaLewinsky If you block, it says to someone you cared enough to take the time to do it, which is a troll badge of honor. If you mute they will spin their wheels til the end of time and you will never hear from them again.
@MonicaLewinsky Mute, don‚Äôt block!
As expected, Diana Ross outshines all - including Santa!!! #Thankful
@disownedcustoms HAHAH! I get it. I host a talk show and don‚Äôt recognize half these people!

@chuckwoolery It was a stupid joke in response to a troll calling me a racist.  That was the context.  This happened two years ago, by the way.  Hope to see you soon Chuck!
@Cindi1Shorty @chuckwoolery I was being sincere, Cindi.
We do NOT need a Northern Exposure re-boot!!! Stop the madness!!!
@chuckwoolery Love me back, Chuck. Can‚Äôt we be friends? You can tell me all your theories and I‚Äôll tell you all mine. We will meet in the middle.
@mrBobbyBones @KimicoleK @merib @BravoWWHL Love you @mrBobbyBones! You‚Äôre taking over the world and I‚Äôm here for it.
@phelps_darla @chuckwoolery You get me, Darla!
I woke up to the news that Chuck Woolery believes I hate white people. (And that I belong to CNN?)  I would hate to think I can‚Äôt trust https://t.co/dGAcujL5Hc, but I‚Äôll be back in 2 and 2 while I figure this out! https://t.co/3nlDPPGXJ0
@katieebee_ Hope so!
@LoriKnowsLuxury @chuckwoolery Take me through your thought process towards thinking it was serious?
@BrianSimsPA @chuckwoolery By the way Chuck is one of the legendary game show hosts and I was honored to host Love Connection years after he did.
@BrianSimsPA @chuckwoolery True.  Are some people so racist that they hate their own race??? Or is it that people are too stupid to understand a joke?
@BrianSimsPA @chuckwoolery Very much so!! And he thinks I hate white people apparently!
@LoriKnowsLuxury @chuckwoolery Yeah I was kidding obviously. Did you know that I‚Äôm white? https://t.co/kLYdTQAUZX
@KimicoleK @merib @mrBobbyBones @BravoWWHL Zero. And I only watched the finale!

It‚Äôs called being President. They‚Äôve all been there. Sam D was a thorn in Reagan‚Äôs side but he knew it was part of his job &amp; dealt gracefully

@KristenTaekman Well deserved!
@jjauthor I think you and I disagree about what special rights mean. It‚Äôs legal to discriminate against LGBT all over the place and it seems to be going further under current admin.  On another note - I‚Äôm majorly impressed with your resume!
@jjauthor @realDonaldTrump Well for starters he wants to ban trans citizens from fighting in the military and the news of his future plans which was reported last week was very disturbing
@jjauthor Can‚Äôt figure out why they are trying to legislate discrimination against LGBT community. Religious Freedom Acts are license to discriminate, and Trump admin has proven he is not a friend to Trans community either.
@MommyRou @BayleeB79 Yeah I don‚Äôt get what this has to do with my show or the election

@odetteroulette @NaomiOMy_ @Bravotv The channel has a massive female representation and POV and is mainly considered for women. That‚Äôs why the show is an oddity.  It would be like an all-female sports show on ESPN, which is a great idea too.
@MaryMotorMouth @FOXTV @LoveConnection I really don‚Äôt I just can‚Äôt stand Trump
@johndegarson This series features both lesbians and gay men
Turn on @FOXTV NOW to catch the new episode of @LoveConnection! #loveconnection
@NaomiOMy_ @odetteroulette @Bravotv You think there could be a show on bravo excluding gay people? We have been leading the way in gay representation since our inception. The word REAL is a play on words the same way it is with REAL housewives.
Good point! https://t.co/XuByyfGkaA
#loveconnection in 20 minutes. You have time to grab a cocktail and make some popcorn!

@smallanimetitty Ok baby
@REALQueenOfRP @BravoIsLife Every so often there is a season that‚Äôs less exciting than others. It‚Äôs an unscripted show. We do what we can!
@Pet_Tepper Stick to nasty tweets about MLK, it suits you!
@Loch_Logan Who said it was Hetero? Are all Real Housewives Housewives?
@LJS3322 @realDonaldTrump @BravoWWHL Love you back! Think the President can get the kids out of the cages and return them to their parents now?
Just when you think everything‚Äôs going to hell you wake up to the news that the boys were ALL rescued.  There is a Gd!
@jwmcalis @bravo REAL housewives... REAL men... it‚Äôs a play in words. It means everybody. Gay, straight it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs gonna be ok!
@BravoIsLife Next season gonna be GREAT.  We are all set and the fans will be thrilled
@rycardom1980 yup I gotcha!

@vhenson Trump calls someone fat but I'm being disrespectful? Hmm.
