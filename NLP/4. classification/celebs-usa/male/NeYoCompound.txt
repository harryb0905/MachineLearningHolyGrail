@itsLeonYT All love bro. Be defined by you’re talent and effort. Not the opinion of other people. NOBODY KNOWS BUT YOU ABOUT YOURS.
@itsLeonYT My talent is not defined by the multiple things that go into what makes a song a hit. Things mind you, that have nothing to do with talent or even music. My best “me” is me right now. But I respect your preference of the older stuff. All love.
@itsLeonYT Says you. I improve with time. Catch up.

@ReesesRoundup Your story is a constantly evolving one. Your “chapter 1” might’ve been when you was a hoe. By the time you reached chapter 5 that wasn’t the case anymore. Therefore “Chapter 1” is a back chapter. Point is everybody’s story has a chapter previous to the current one. A past.
Jones Beach tonight! Who’s comin thru?? #letsgo #goodmanseason https://t.co/LfXZpZsJNm

@MrsStealYoWIFI You’re entitled to that.Take it how you want love. If this song goes wood I still apologized for my wrongs in front of the world. My mission is accomplished ether way. GOD bless.
@illlustrious_ @rafiiily Then trash in your eyes I’ll be. GOD bless.
@Mexi421 @_O_O__O_O @chocoletedaddy @MerQury_ Thanx for the love mama.
@meg_dow Wasn’t sarcastic. That’s the issue. That and you just wanna fight. I really don’t have time for that. Save these tweets love. ✌🏾
@SynbiosModeste That’s the way you see this? That’s what it says to you? Broaden your vision.
@illlustrious_ @rafiiily I give them recognition thru the medium that has defined my life for my entire life, song. I give them a public apology in front of the world. In most cases you didn’t even get an private apology, let alone a spectacle. #letsbereal
@MrsStealYoWIFI Or don’t buy it. Your choice. Doesn’t change the apology or it’s meaning. Y’all want me to be petty and shallow so bad....sorry to disappoint.
@Mexi421 @_O_O__O_O @chocoletedaddy @MerQury_ I dedicated a whole song on an album and released it to the world. Thus us even having this conversation in defense of women you don’t even know....that’s a good start if you ask me.
@meg_dow Too smart for that. Seriously. Ok NOW I’m done. ✌🏾✌🏾
@meg_dow Stop calling yourself a basic bitch.
@meg_dow Am I going off or is this a conversation? You hear yelling in my tweets? Take it easy love. Was nice debating with you.
@illlustrious_ @rafiiily Btw...a song on an album that the world has the potential and possibility of hearing feels pretty “tangible action” to me. GOD bless.
@illlustrious_ @rafiiily I berated no one. I apologized because it needed to be done. Acceptance of that apology is on the person receiving. If you personally don’t accept the apology that’s your choice. I won’t take food from my kids to prove a point to you. GOD bless.
@williamFanSpain Not this time😉
@nahhh_b I’m at home. Music is my home. And my bald head hasn’t held me back in any way so far. Speak for yourself, GOD bless
@meg_dow You’re smart. Build on that please. We need more like you.
@illlustrious_ @rafiiily Are you seriously expecting me to give money the women I’m apologizing to in this song? So that’s a positive message? Forgiveness is for sale? That’s gonna get the point across?
@ATruGent Amen brother.
@KnobodyNose Appreciate the love❤️
@amandab44286565 Congrats!! All love always!
@nangakajoseph1 All love❤️
@lxndrew Damn..not really sure mama.
@illlustrious_ @rafiiily Mature.
@Manidoesitbestt If you’ve dedicated yourself to the wrong information already what does it matter? You call bullshit THEN ask for the explanation? I see where your head is at. I won’t waste the time. GOD bless.
@meg_dow So the image means the apology isn’t sincere? That really is a basic way of thinking. Guess your name is right on the money. I’ve given you more time than it was worth and all the time I will. GOD bless.
@Manidoesitbestt Again, someone who’s stuck in the dark. I did not make anybody do anything. What you’re speaking on is a situation that was mutilated by the media. A mistake I have long since spoken on and corrected. Please get all the facts before the drag attempt. GOD bless.
@rafiiily I did this song for myself and for them. If you don’t like the song you don’t have to listen. If you don’t accept the apology that’s your choice. I’m in a positive place with this and won’t let the negativity of a few change that. GOD bless mama.
Much love to all those who have chimed in about the song #apology your input is appreciated. We are all works in progress. Remembering that when dealing with people helps. Some of us are working on ourselves. It’s a process. You won’t be perfect..so try to be good. #GoodManSeason
@ATruGent Got you my guy.
@meg_dow It’s an image. And we all see it differently. That’s what you see? Says more about you than me.
@rafiiily Nobody asked for that. And I have 4 kids. No thanx.
@_O_O__O_O @chocoletedaddy @MerQury_ @Mexi421 I never said I don’t care if I’m forgiven. Don’t mix up the words now. I said I didn’t apologize to be forgiven. It’s not always as simple as an apology. I apologized because it needed to be done. Whether or not I’m forgiven is the choice of the person wronged.
@CoralAOTW @deplorkibble @CauseAndCulture What does that even mean? How can you tell me what I’m sincere about? GOD bless.
@CiagaDan @chocoletedaddy @MerQury_ @Mexi421 You 1st.
@shaydeeaftamath Wow. Guess we’ll be there together. It’s a sin to curse another person too ya know....🤷🏾‍♂️
TWO WEEKS till #GoodMan drops! Cop a pre-order bundle now at https://t.co/NLSq6d5alv #goodmanseason https://t.co/aYYZPzjBLW
@CauseAndCulture You’re entitled to feel what you want, to make any assumption you want to the meaning of it. All I can do is say what I’ve said. Whether you accept (much like an apology) is your choice. GOD bless.
@deplorkibble @CauseAndCulture I’m not a perfect person and I’m doing my part to show my maturity and sincerity in these difficult matters. No one from my passed has asked me for a personal apology. For them the song is enough. That’s enough for me.
@CauseAndCulture @invisible97 It’s for both. It’s therapeutic for me and it lets them know I see the wrong in what I did. If a person does wrong by you and doesn’t care about how it makes you feel, doesn’t that make it feel worse?
@TeReexX It takes time. Won’t be quick or easy. Takes real effort to truly forgive.
@chocoletedaddy @MerQury_ @Mexi421 You’re not paying attention. I’m saying I’m sorry because I identify with the wrong I’ve done and the pain I’ve caused.
@CauseAndCulture What would you have me do, call every woman I’ve ever done wrong in my life personally one by one? From the beginning to now? I don’t have that kind of time love. If you just want to be upset, do that. Don’t have to throw unrealistic expectations at me in order to do so.
@TruLady_Shallot That’s black twitter’s choice. Just sad that some people have been THAT hurt before, that I’ve hurt someone that bad before. I recognize and apologize. That is all I can do.
@CauseAndCulture @invisible97 I know why they’re reluctant to forgive. Again, you assume I don’t. You’re right, some pain runs deep and an apology most times isn’t enough to fix that. Which is why the apology isn’t for the sake of being forgiven. It’s acknowledgement of the pain I caused and remorse.
@MerQury_ @Mexi421 That’s your choice love. I didn’t do it for your forgiveness, or anyone’s for that matter. I did it because it needed to be done. I pray your heart lightens at some point.
@CauseAndCulture So because you’ve experienced an apology that wasn’t sincere you assume mine isn’t? I can’t feel bad for my passed wrongs? Do we now live in a world where a person can’t even say “I’m sorry?”
@TeReexX I’m not asking for forgiveness. We don’t apologize to be forgiven, we apologize to let the person we wronged know that we identify with the hurt we caused and that we are remorseful for it. Forgiveness is the choice of the wronged. If I’m forgiven or not, I still must apologize.
@Mexi421 With no ego I say that to contact every woman I ever lied to or cheated on in my life personally would take more time than I have. I give issue in my life meaning thru song. After reflecting I identify with the pain I caused. This song is my way of letting that be known.
@EyakwaZulu Pt 4 ...I could easily run from my wrongs or pass the buck like we normally do. Instead I chose to not only address them but take it upon myself to show that I identify with the hurt I caused. I had to apologize. To accept the apology or not is your choice.
@EyakwaZulu Pt 3 ...It’s really sad that in this moment of reform and redemption the only thing anyone wants to pay any attention to is that it’s on an album that is for sale. Music is my life you know. It’s my therapy and the way I feed my family. Takes nothing from the sincerity of this...
@EyakwaZulu Pt. 2 ...and I’m curious as to what you would have me do. I’ve matured since I did these wrongs and in the name of recollection and self reflection I decided to take this issue (as I do every issue in my life) to the realm of song. It’s the way I show an issue importance...
Can’t wait for y’all to hear my joint with @RomeoSantosPage… 😏 @fusetv #goodmanseason https://t.co/cja8rHOvCX
@EyakwaZulu Pt. 1 This apology is for ALL the women I’ve wronged in the process of growing up. I’m not in co tact with more than most of them and in that I’m a married man reaching out to them personally probably isn’t the best move, even to apologize...
My heart goes out to those in the world that have been done so wrong by someone that they can’t even fathom accepting any sort of apology. Forgiveness does not excuse the wrong doing...it does however allow us the space to try and move on to more positive waters.
@EyakwaZulu Still don’t see the reason for the “FUCK YOU” Are you upset at the fact that I’m apologizing for my passed wrongs or....???
@EyakwaZulu For what exactly? Apologizing?

Being a #goodman is to be responsible for your own actions, for the heart of the person you’ve made this promise to, to hold yourself accountable. It’s not about how much you can get away with.

@gleeek4ever @StepUpSeries You’re entitled to your own opinion. But to say that anyone that says they liked my acting is lying is just rude. I appreciate your honest opinion and with no anger in my heart I say speak for yourself.
@lxndrew @StepUpSeries juat go to YouTube and search “step up : HIGHWATER”
So how do you all feel about @stepupseries ?? *Brutal Honesty Only*
@Pisces_ofMe im@going to address your ignorance. I’ve never claimed to be perfect. Never said I’ve never hurt anyone. I SAID I’VE NEVER FORCED A WOMAN TO DO ANYTHING. EVER. A perfect man, no. A Good Man, in every way I can be. Every butterfly you ever saw was a caterpillar 1st..

Make it simple, but significant.
Never trade respect for attention.
When someone does something wrong, don't forget all the things they did right.
The smarter you get the less you speak.
Two things define you: your patience when you have nothing and your attitude when you have everything.
Check out my bro @KevinRossMusic new EP #Drive... https://t.co/18uf8CPgKC I see you bruh. 🔥
