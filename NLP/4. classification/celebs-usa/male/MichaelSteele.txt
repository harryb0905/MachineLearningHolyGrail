Ok so what we‚Äôre experiencing from Trump for the first 5 mins is his version of stream of conscience...wait for it..ahh there it is border security...no wait, not yet...ok back on #TheWall #portsofEntry

Trump: "The Democrats changed their minds on border security only after I was elected president". But wait, you CHANGED YOUR MIND last month after you were bitch-slapped by certain conservatives. Just sayin'.
Pres. Reagan understood that through "these Golden Doors" immigrants "came not asking what this country could do for them, but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in History." Tonight, Trump will tell us he will build a wall around those doors.

@rickungar I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and BS.
In response to @AprilDRyan question, the safety net for federal workers who aren‚Äôt getting their paychecks or SSI payments (and may not for up to a year because of the shutdown according to Trump) is...wait for it...wait for it..‚Äùbuilding the wall!‚Äù Thanks @realDonaldTrump
So the goal during this presser for @SteveScalise @GOPLeader (McCarthy) and @SecNielsen standing behind Trump is no matter he says, just look straight ahead‚Äîespecially as he explains the difference between a steel and concrete wall because we didn‚Äôt know there was a difference.
Trump: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt call it a shutdown. I call it doing what you have to do‚Äù.  So federal workers there‚Äôs some comfort for you.
@BettewH @CNN @EWTN Nope. Not saying that all. Just stop pretending we‚Äôre so outraged when in fact we‚Äôre not. When evangelical leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr. say there is ‚Äúnothing‚Äù Trump could do to forfeit their support how do folks get upset about this? What lesson does that teach?
Ok people let‚Äôs stop feigning indignation. This door has been opened wide by Trump; does not concern the voters and will become the norm for candidates (Beto‚Äôs f‚Äôbomb) and electeds (Rashida) going forward. We are a long way from Joe Wilson‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou lie!‚Äù Remember that ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù? https://t.co/sKTR3gSRht

An amazing moment and image. When Trump arrived everyone else stopped talking and looked straight ahead. Only the Obamas had the good fortune to shake Trump‚Äôs hand and if Michelle Obama‚Äôs face was any indication...well, let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt the best part of her day. https://t.co/eBYu8CGIug
@LindseyGrahamSC and @SenBobCorker confirm "Mohammad bin Salman...is complicit in the murder of Khashoggi in the highest level possible." So now what? How will MBS be held accountable? We know the talk; what will be your walk? https://t.co/GVXBrWM8Cr

‚ÄúThe National Republican Congressional Committee also spent heavily this year as it fought to defend the GOP majority, taking out a $12 million line of credit that still has to be paid off‚Äù.  But how is that debt different from the LOC we took out in‚Äô10 to WIN the House? #curious
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs common for campaigns and party committees to finish election cycles in the hole as they throw everything they have ‚Äî and then some ‚Äî at an election.‚Äù Wait, what?! You mean the DNC went into debt to win elections?! Why the hell would anyone do that?! https://t.co/2ioNw4xtTw

What?!? Wait! This from the man who has been his own best ‚Äúannoymous source‚Äù for decades; anonymously giving the press only ‚Äúthe best‚Äù information about or acting as the fictitious spokesman for‚Äîhimself? Of course stories based on such sources are fiction. #Duh https://t.co/yYdeQKORWC
Just the way some want it. https://t.co/aEOnL2rzcp
@carlsonmargaret great piece on renaming the Russell Senate Office building after @SenJohnMcCain may have some resistance: Trump https://t.co/RDO3syC3nV
Congratulations to my friend @HuntsmanAbby and to the Ladies of @TheView. Ya‚Äôll about to have too much fun! #keepinitreal https://t.co/zLX3nvc733
@playnwitpurpose @dcstl @evansiegfried @SenJohnMcCain Dude, you really need to put down the booze and scratch yourself with a little mummy finger instead.
Bet you didn't know "there's a body in Trump's closet". Uh uh; and Dem strategist Don Calloway @dcstl and GOP strategist @evansiegfried do the forensics. Also we salute @SenJohnMcCain and his service to the nation all on the latest #ManofSteelepodcast.  https://t.co/Qe3NpKCqLW
Oh yeah! Thanks ‚Å¶@WatsonInstitute‚Å©  https://t.co/4fcbN2nntX
@a19marvet @WatsonInstitute The disrespect of @SenJohnMcCain and his family by @POTUS is unconscionable.
@rualncfemale @WatsonInstitute Please do!! Thanks you!
Thank you @WatsonInstitute and the students of Brown University for the opprtumity to serve as a Senior Fellow.  Given the state of political affairs I can‚Äôt imagine what we could possibly talk about! #signup https://t.co/rTNEH2V3Zb

A good and honorable man has been taken from us but he has left foot steps in leadership, independence, service and sacrifice for us to follow. We will miss you @SenJohnMcCain https://t.co/JDLju0pZuo
Wow! https://t.co/hPq1UrOnEd
Would love to have seen his face when you said ‚Äúno‚Äù! But I note it‚Äôs those ‚Äúunderstandable institutional reasons‚Äù that he, like others, uses as an excuse for riding the Trump train and then want you to either ignore or forgive so you can vouch for his ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù. #nothappening https://t.co/xYirJN2dRh
We love him too @cindymccain for his faithfulness, his service and most important, his family. Thank you for sharing this personal and very difficult part of your journey with @SenJohnMcCain with all of us. #muchlove #Respect https://t.co/fvAmP3TLkj

‚Äò‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened,‚Äù they [the bishops] say. Spare us this fake public-relations drivel. We don‚Äôt need your sadness, we don‚Äôt need new policies. We need better men.‚Äô @michaelbd I could not have expressed it better.  https://t.co/b4mCXyYyUX

No tax cut or SCOTUS appointment is worth this crazy. You‚Äôd strip all of them? Why? Because they call out your ish everyday? And exactly what political agenda would that be?

‚ÄúThe president has said a number of things about individuals who are not African American‚Äù. ‚ÄîSarah Huckabee Sanders. And that makes calling @OMAROSA a ‚Äúdog‚Äù ok? You cannot spin Trump out of his bigoted slur. #justplainwrong #shame

@Animalperson21 @MSNBC You so crazy.
Oh @Omarosa you sound like Trump with a threat I could give a rat‚Äôs ass about. I think pretty much everybody knows what I think about those two characters because I‚Äôve said it publicly‚Äîdaily. Your opportunism belies your now plaintive pleas and fake victimhood. https://t.co/LqubCDlJz2

So ‚Å¶@OMAROSA‚Å© when you said: ‚ÄúEvery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump‚Äù does that now include you? Oh, and I guess ‚Å¶@POTUS‚Å© being a racist wasn‚Äôt enough to stop you from working for him‚Å©. #notcredible https://t.co/Bjaf83rDiq

@Scaramucci,-The Mooch- and the #ManofSteele get into a not so subtle dissection of how @realDonaldTrump needs to change up his game from his war on the media to #Russia to @KingJames. https://t.co/pV5dwWUlzF
@Sabretooth94 True. A win is a win. But when you typically win by significant margins (since 1938) you should perhaps be concerned when that margin drops to one.
OMG this applies to soo much and to too many! https://t.co/SdHgR21a1o

oh oh. Sh*t's about to get real. And so Trump sends out Rudy Guilliani to say "Cohen's been lying for years". This, after Trump has always insisted "I only hire the best people".

"My people came to me...they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be." --Trump  That's how a press conference sounds when an Asset stands next to his Handler.
"The Russian State has never interfered and will never interfere in American internal politics"--Putin ‚ÄúOur relationship has never been worse than it is now, but that changed as of about four hours ago.‚Äù "I hold both countries responsible. I think we‚Äôre all to blame"‚ÄîTrump  #sad

In @JebBush smackdown of @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio tags in to defend GWB.

Why do politicians who have been in office FOREVER keep reminding us "we have a lot of work to do." Why haven't they done it? #justdoit
@HillaryClinton feeling a little cocky pushing Bernie on who she "listens to on foreign policy". @BernieSanders appears to careless.

@greggutfeld me too!
So do the Russians hold the torch lighting the way out of or the way into a deeper mess in Syria?
@ahayher maybe. At least it took him 2 years to build international support. Where is the "coalition of the willing" for this?
After speech, not a mind has been changed, or a vote swayed in Congress to go into Syria.  What is plan "B" after a strike? #stilldontknow
Agreed. ‚Äú@marclamonthill: So far, the President is giving the same speech he would have given before the developments from Russia...‚Äù
Obama talking about his asking Congress to weigh in on Syria as if it were some noble constitutional principle. #thepollsmademedoit
Obama: if we fail to act Assad will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons.

All the more reason to stay out of Syria. ‚Äú@TheFix: "We cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force." -- President Obama.‚Äù

@IngrahamAngle @MileyCyrus Some "history" is better left unmade.
@robertcostaNRO Agreed a split-which Obama and Boehner both need.
Kerry realizes his gaffe (a.k.a truth) about "boots on the ground" as he restates (again) what he meant.
@robertcostaNRO @kasie Establishment vs.The Base
What is the "greater reality if we don't do something"? Was the reality different when Assad murdered 100Ks with conventional weapons?
@ezraklein @NowWithAlex It's like those boots that aren't on the ground, hypothetically speaking.
When u have to say u have independent mind...RT @HuntsmanAbby: I approach this with a heavy heart and an independent mind - Sen. Boxer
Are we clear? RT @kasie: Kerry, re boots on ground: "I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be on the table."
He opened the door.RT @krystalball: Shorter Kerry: there will be no boots on the ground unless we decide we need boots on the ground. #Syria
@mattklewis Me too! But wait, I thought this wasnt about regime change--just a good cleansing.
Kerry: "This is the not time for armchair isolationism". Questioning a military strike is not isolationist. It's applying common sense.
It is amazing to listen to leaders on the Left make the case for a unilateral strike against Syria. #soundfamiliar
