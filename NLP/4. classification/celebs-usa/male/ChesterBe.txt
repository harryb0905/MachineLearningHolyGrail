I'm loving SPIRIT#DepecheMode❤️❤️
@AnnaNonstop WATSKY is a rapper
WATSKY'S X INFINITY is fucking genius!!
I ❤️ WATSKY
@rocknroll_gurl I didn't notice. I was having too much fun playing music with my friends.
@Tony26099862 @ArmoredMexican We do that too
@AxeMeHowIKnow Your bacon helmet is 🔥
@Tony26099862 You are correct sir.
@chokingfic I owe them nothing
@JessCersche Yes ironic and funny
Does anyone else find it funny that the same people calling us sellouts are suggesting that we change our set to conform to HELLFEST 😂
@thejaff27 @cnni I add the thumb.
All kidding aside.... the crowd was great and handled our set pretty well. Our French fans are awesome.
I welcomed the huge crowd of condemned souls to HELLFEST in my metal voice then we played Invisible. The look of shock on people's faces😮🤣
After I blew kisses to the guys flipping me off. They smiled and gave me heart hands back.
@ArmoredMexican I know🤣😂🤣. They'll be moshing to Heavy in 15 years too🤗
Hell fest was fun. Had a blast watching people mosh to In the End and then flip me off when we played Heavy. I blew them kisses😘
@cnni LAME!!!
@gmford @LPFanCorner That would suck!
@linkinlenya @mikeshinoda I love it. Mike is the best
@LinkinparkMexi Fear is my bitch👊
@celiyears Yes
@NLopezdeArenosa I've had all water bottles removed from the floor😂🤣😂
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/Af72LNiCEa
@lukyacademico All great. No doubt. They all were apart of great teams. Lebron has carried his teams on his back each year. This team's the best he's had.
GO KEVIN DURANT!!!!
Very special time in NBA history.
Lebron is the greatest of all time!!
Durant and Curry are the best!!
Draymond Green is fav player of all time!
GO WARRIORS!!!!!!!!!!
The crowd in Prague was 🔥it's truly a gift to play in front of such passionate fans🙏❤️
The man who got me to love super heros has passed away. RIP Adam West! You were the best. Thank you for making me happy🙏
@stefanietrummer It's great!
@maddpoet007 IK... SWEET
@pritamlp12 PHX SUNS. I watch a lot of teams because I'm more of a fan of players opposed to teams.
The time between basketball season and football season is my equivalent to being cast into the phantom zone!!!
@linkinparknglot Basketball lives just under US Football
@kathryn_meteora I play basketball. Football is my passion next to music
@IamSeera Yes
@ckjackson5 Cardinals
I can't wait until football season is here! Rugby is keeping me happy for now!!!
@LPLive It's only going to get crazier
@trucefortyler @mikeshinoda You are very talented
@darkmagicgirl33 What are you guys talking about?
@darkmagicgirl33 Because that's the song I'm playing in that photo

Thank you to all of the men a women who ave made the ultimate sacrifice so that we may live free in the greatest country in the world!
My baby girl graduated today!! One of the greatest moments of my life❤️❤️ https://t.co/pzm8d9XUV5
@DeathAngelS300 @GirlGamer7 I may just do it all on my own
@mcann1989 @mikeshinoda Vocal
@GirlGamer7 Maybe
Feeling very creative this last week. I've written 6 songs and I'm happy with all of them. Just getting started. 🤘
@bounty_hunt_er @mikeshinoda I wouldn't give them that much credit
@Meredeth95 @LPLive No. It's been a tough week. Not looking forward to tomorrow.
@IAmxXSCHWABIEXx Thanks. We know we take big risks with each album. Glad you're still with us
@ShellVOX @LPLive It's cute that you think you know how the music bilusiness works, how we work, what we think. Love your passion though 🙏
@LPLive We share all expenses.
@LPLive You guys are way over thinking this. 😂
@LemonNinjaa @LPLive We knew that prior to making the album and did it anyway. We wanted our fans who love heavy music to be happy.
@LPLive ALSO, THP, though it's a fav amongst some fans doesn't appeal to a larger audience. Hard rock is very hard to promote on a large scale.
@LPLive GATS was too ROCK for radio. UIG was dropped for political reasons that were beyond our control.
@LPLive We planned to do a full world tour, including Australia for HTP, I required multiple surgeries and therapy for my ankle. We had to move on
@ABC7 Heaven
@itzdahbauz Haha. Not my best moment.
@DrunkyBorghy That applies to me as well. You are a smart girl
@NickGTR46 You have every right to feel that way. Thanks for your honesty.
@badgalkemy Corey is a friend of mine. He's a good guy
@MyNameIsJared77 That's interesting. I believe if we keep making music the same way each time we abandon what makes us great. Funny how that works
@RazzleJOY1111 True, but everyone deserves respect even if they are disrespectful. If it were an eye for an eye we'd all be blind.
@NickGTR46 Bummed you feel that way.
@Shan8876 It was meant to be funny. But written words can be taken out of context.
Time to recalibrate my perspective. So I say to all of our fans... Thank you and I love you all. Peace, love and happiness🙏
Either way... there is a lot of passion on both sides and I am grateful to all of our fans. Corey is a good dude and I appreciate him too🤘
I'm human and sometimes take things too personally. Most of our fans have been very positive lately. Some... not so much.
Just heard Corey Taylor's response to something I said in an interview and I agree with him. I do appreciate our fans.
If we look outside ourselves to find love and peace we will ultimately fail. It has to come from within. Lead by example.
Let's all choose to be a part of the cure.
Hate, pride, vengeance, and fear are the plague of the earth. Love, kindness, compassion, empathy and service to others are the cure.
As of today, my life's purpose is one of love and understanding. The world needs to change and that change comes from within.
My heart goes out to the victims and families of those who lost their lives and were injured last night in Manchester.

#iHeartLinkinPark #OneMoreLight 🌅 https://t.co/lNUtOwNbm6
Thanks for all the love. Time to be a Dad.
@Glorioso_Galo Radio wouldn't play the hunting party because it was too "heavy". I broke my ankle and that stopped our touring.
@nickand4639 Because every song has that tag for some reason.
@Glorioso_Galo I think it's important for fans not to speak on behalf of the band. I love every record we have made. Our last 2 are in my top 3
@Juliidominguezz Agreed
@araujophilippe Many of these songs live in multiple genres.
Here's a playlist of some tasty Hip Hop/Electro rock monsters. Enjoy🙏 https://t.co/4X3FLo5sIa

@mutant_kid_ @darkmagicgirl33 @pritamlp12 @linkinpark @mikeshinoda @TalindaB @AnnaShinoda @LPFanCorner @LPLive @Meredeth95 @Chantelelise12 Hybrid theory was given a 2 star rating and we were criticised for being too pop for metal. 🤣
With all of my love @chriscornell. https://t.co/NFz0dnxfp8
@Cynthia_dz97 not to a lot of people
I'd like to thank our fans for killing it at the last 2 shows. We have the best fans in the world❤️🔥🙏👊🤘
Hybrid Theory, Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, A Thousand Suns, Living Things, the Hunting Party &amp; One More Light = LINKIN PARK 🙏
@DrewOnTheRadio That's not true. I love that record. I'm glad people still do too.
@t3hSt1ngray @mikeshinoda @gwatsky  already on it. He is playing a lot of shows, so scheduling has been a but of an issue
@LPLive @mlebean Emily is a vocal producer. Not a vocalist. I'm singing on those songs
@TalindaB that's my baby boo😘❤️
Forgot to bring clothes with me for after the show. Ben chillin in my undies a robe and a pair of Chuck Taylor's. Customs loves me
I ❤️US ARMED FORCES! Thank you for all that you do for us🙏
@vishwa_kartik @linkinpark this makes no sense
John Kasich's town hall on CNN is inspiring! This is a good man doing good things for this country🙏

@lovelouder_ thanks ;)
@smithoxx Brad
@Brown97Danny I did.
@thehybridthings I've been doing them at the end of every show for at least 10 years.
@FerallyHuman it would have been to repair damaged vocal folds. Which I have never had. My folds are made of steel!! ;)
@FerallyHuman poorly informed journalists who don't actually do their jobs and fact check.
@fromblm I'm assuming it came after a poor performance where I lost my voice from being sick. Other than that I have no idea.
@AminHanina yes. But they like to draw on the stage while we play.
@WardEdojawa haha. No I've out grown those.
@pokka66 @phoenixlp I dance backstage every night
@ali2412 because the only guitar I had access to was a right handed guitar. I also play golf right handed for the same reason ;)
Any journalist, blogger, Dr., or otherwise who says I have, is full of shit and should be kicked in the butthole for saying so. ;) haha
I would like to end a rumor that keeps coming up and is totally annoying. I have never had any surgery for my vocal chords.
What a great show tonight! The crowd was fucking awesome!!! Thank you!!!!!!

Lets be real... The term "Redskins" is obviously offensive and Native Americans deserve to be respected and honored!!
The Redskins name has specifically been why I have never supported the team even when they deserve to be. I suggest "the Natives".
I think it's good that the issue of changing the Redskins name is being considered. I've always found it offensive.

Good night friends. I love you all and hope that you all can love each other too. I'll tweet more tomorrow. Thank you for a great discussion
@WillyAndrade5 regardless of what you think of him. He fought his war with out violence. A perfect example of how conflict does not = death
@tashaabdaziz Muslims are a people of peace and good deeds. Extremists are no different than the Christian KKK. They use faith for evil.
@TheTammyBunt  You can live a life that inspires others to do good. Lead by your own actions. Forgive those who cause you harm.
It's better to die fighting by not fighting than to give the enemy any reason to justify murdering peole who they know will murder them too
Ghandi defeated the British without firing a single shot. When his people decided to fire back at British soldiers he ordered them to stop.
Rising up against dictators &amp; war hungry governments. With nonviolent methods will defeat any power using force and death.
I want peace for everyone! Evil will only die when WE choose to love all of our brothers and sisters whoever they are in the world.
@R1ya_ I agree with you, unfortunately there are too many of these horrifying events all over the world. I want peace for Afghanistan.
@__MarcelR  you are valuable, and nessessary. We cannot allow madmen, tyrants, rapists, pedi files, and murderers keep us good guys down!
@MichaelKing49  I will destroy you :|
On anyone who chooses not to believe in those principals. All human interaction should be respectable and tolerant, as well as consensual.
To conform by a group or government. Nor should those who choose to live an evil or religious lifestyle be permitted to force their beliefs
Choose peace over war. And tolerance of other societies. We all have basic human rights, no one should be forced  for fear of death....
Unfortunatly, governments resort to war. And in war there will always be collateral damage. It will never end until people everywhere ....
@R1ya_ I also believe that war of all kids is wrong. Violence is primitive. There are always nonviolent ways to resolve conflict.
They will never stop searching for this coward killer. And bring them to justice!
Boston is a great city. They will rise above this terrifying event. They will come together as Americans fighting for their fallen friends.
My heart breaks for the families of the people who lost their lives today in Boston. My prayers go out to those who were injured.
My heart goes out to Chi's family and friends. He was a great guy and a legendary player!
Sorry it's supposed to be @devicetheband
@Slash can't wait to see you there brother.
My boy David Draimam is killing it with his new record. Check out @devicethe band

@DesertAumakua  I am not a supporter of illeagal activity. I know there are bad people coming across. But that does not represent all 11mm
RT @Hershy1: Here is an article from the NYT's... I am shocked that AZ has passed such a law.. http://nyti.ms/avJkf2
Google new Arizona law to see what I'm talking about.
Arizona has become a facist, police state. We all stand by while our rights are stripped away. I support all upstanding illegal immigrants
People should not live in fear of the government in this country. The white, right wing, conservatives in AZ are nothing but terrorists!!!!
I am ashamed of my home state, and the Republican Party. The new law is uncostitutional and sends the wrong message to the world.
The law that passed today in Arizona is a slap in the face of hard working people who have come to America to live better lives.
This show is one of the best I've seen them play. Anyone who isn't a Muse fan is banned from music for life!!!

What
@Victoria_LPF thank you very much:)
Listening than we will tour, and make more music. I'm really proud of what we created in DBS
So. With that said. Help us do the job that our record company was supposed to do. Tell people about the record. If we know people are
Like the record. Some don't. What's really interesting is that almost all of you said that it wasn't promoted very well.
So late last night I asked you guys some questions about DBS. I got alot of great feedback and I want to thank all of you. Most of you guys
Thanks for all of the great input. I truly appreciate the honesty in which you all answered my questions. You are all awesome! Goodnight :)
@Twong3 well taken. I agree
@GiLb3r no. It's just hard for bands to know they have fans if the record doesn't sell. Illeagal downloads don't relay "make more music"
@alexandrecadene thanks
@mckellynna not offended. You're great. Thank you for being honest:)
@Jude_Uncertain thanks
@gonzo_lust thank you! I haven't really heard alot of negative. It's just not selling. Wich makes think negatively about it
@summertony maybe. Thanks
@phoenixdragon25 cool thanks
@brandon288 thank you. I am proud of the record. But maybe I could have pushed myself harder. Because somethings not connecting
@fragglerawktina thank you

@djrmc24 they were limited. You can get them at clubtattoo.com
@mckellynna ok
@sarah448 ok
@marijo35 it's cool. More importantly do you like it?
@maree_lizz thanks
@rikilshah no need to cross them. It kicks ass!!! If people don't like this record then that means I suck and should do something else
@Jodz1984 I don't care how peole get their music. It's just hard to tell if people get it that way. If they do, cool, I'll just never know
@mrsrllamb :)
@peetwence thanks
@naturalmagic83 sweet
@lpfmfan thanks
@justinmabee I myself. Promise that the new LP is fucking insane. Complex. Heavy without metal. Strong hiphop. Mix HT and M2M. Melodic
@brandon288 that is a very nice way of saying they didn't like it. Totally cool. Thanks for the info
@CRISISICE yeah I wasn't feeling like screaming. But I kind of hope people don't just want to here me scream. But I can't defend a failure.
@missaleigh07 thanks
@bevictoriouss thank you
@CLanceAnderson that's cool . Thanks for the info

@rikilshah  cool thanks
@KevCantStop  thank you
@truthispoison @Dead_Red_Roses thank you
So here's the question. Does the record suck? Is it good but peole just don't care? Or is everybody downloading illeagaly? Honesty please...
Hey everyone! I've been super busy, so not posting much. I have a question for DBS fans since the record has not sold shit in the US.

@rynsk Dude I've been Mr. Poopypants all day to! Weird..C
@Victoria_LPF I looked at your gallery and it's intresting to watch how you've grown as an artist. The pic I saw last night is your best:)
Good night:)
@Hahninator I don't know. It's a dead subject to me.
@Curiosafmmb me too.
@LPPanther if everyones already heard the track what's the point ?
@LPPanther we never finished the song I spent an hour writing and recording the track it's basically a demo.
The show will most likely be free. I don't know how much it costs to fly from Texas
Good night
@Victoria_LPF got it
@Cdjalma very cute
@violethill1234 we were considering it, but I decided not to do it
@Victoria_LPF I'm following now  so you can DM me now:)
@Victoria_LPF Amazing! DM me your e-mail address I'd like to talk to you privately!!
@markcolz sweet you guys rule! Thanks!
@ALH30 to Vegas?
@serenalee522 see you there
@nathydiaz Runaway!
@marie06_30 yeah!
@AnsticeJade I just e mailed Jessica. She should give the info soon
@AnsticeJade I think that's lame too. I'll ask Jessica about it
@Cdjalma how come what?
@markcolz I haven't what's it all about?
@Cdjalma at Emoda.com
@lpfv1 probably both
@diannesalcedo nice
@krusnik02 cool. I can never tell who's crazy until I check
@Hahninator don't worry there will be plenty of opritunities to hear that song. If the fans want it bad enough I'll record it and release it
@lJLeeRSX we will always do the heavy stuff. It makes us happy:)
@Cdjalma thank you
@KOBSHI that could be cool
@krusnik02 I know super gross dirty foot and super grow ripped skin. Super awesome tweet pic:)
@Cdjalma I've been trying to put one together for the last 5 years
@nathydiaz Egypt, South Africa, Israe, and everwhere else we havent playedl
@diannesalcedo oh ya. I remember
@Cdjalma I hope so
@krusnik02 no you're not. Sorry to break the news to ya
@saycrack what are you talking about?
@haysbjohnson don't know yet.
@lpfv1 DBS is on WB. I don't understand the rest of your questions:)
@NyValerieC09 sweet
@dondejong next year probably
@ALH30 Just DBS
@KOBSHI me too. Touring in Asia and Australia is very expensive. Usually we make just enough to cover our expesnes. But it's worth it!!!!
@phill715 we will tour, hopefully worldwide
@Tattyh my voice is stronger than ever. Screaming is no problem.
@THEChesterDEAN you rule !
@zara19 maybe
@EriolVlad El Salvador Fuck Yeah
@analoggirl1 grazzi
@Cansu87 maybe I'll sing a little acapella for you at the show. But you need to remind me
@Cansu87 I love that song but some of the guys don't like it so much
@markcolz World wide of course:)
@RyANberlin26 around august prolly
@Hahninator Lethals a great guy. But the songs not very good.
@HowellsAlexH @eve6er69 No It seems kind of redundant. We will be performing it though
@skulldemon13 I'll post it within the next couple weeks
@SBWinner I'll be hangin with the fans
@Hahninator no
@elands fuck yeah
@AllNurote I don't think so. If it was selling the lyrics it would be. Or if it was claiming to have created the lyrics it would be
@Hybrid911 next week
@Cansu87 we'll see
@pat1990 we were talking about it. But I decided not to
@LadySelaine 10. I like records with 10 songs. All of the great records from the 60s and 70s were around 10 tracks..
@krispurplecat thanks
@stephmoorephoto my management @ the Collective
@Diioogoo no it's an original
@Hybrid911 I'm sure it will be up as soon as we play
@jabbablinks thanks
@krispurplecat LP isn't DBS will
@eve6er69 sweet
@Taylor510CE they were good
@babybunny1987 we are at the hospital now:(
@SBWinner yes
@missnatalie1984 That depends on how well the record sells. We can't tour without money:) I hope so though
@wickdaman cool those guys are good peeps
@miwar I don't think we're charging for tickets
@NamelessTheory that's not gonna happen
Either way you can still see the show on the strip it will be broadcast on the Jumbotron outside Planet Hollywood. And outside the shop
@Pawlion we are working out the details now. I'm not sure if it's going to be invite only or who ever gets there first gets in.
@justbill it's probably going to be a song called Crawl Back In. We will be shooting a video in a couple months
@Taylor510CE this show is very early in terms of touring for DBS. We will be announcing tour dates as we get closer to the release
We'll be performing 5 songs. 4 are on the record. So tell everyone you know:)
Hey everyone. I'm ready to get out and play some shows. I'll be playing in Las Vegas July 4 at Club Tattoo at Miricle Mile shops.
I'm going on a date with my woman. Talk tomorrow:)
@missnatalie1984 I know guys are weird:)
@riceball Tampa and Phoenix
@AnsticeJade I didn't have socks or shoes I had sandals
@Vdalem I've got a platinum ER card:)
@maha_kp thanks for the advice
@AnsticeJade socks would have helped
@Taylor510CE OUCH
@ALH30 you're not the only one:)
@CUERVOGOLD09 Breaking the habit
@Taylor510CE yes it is. LAME and gross
@markcolz I'm good thanks
@MrsJAG35 totally gross:)
@UNICORNMONSTER I would say that we are friends. They all have been very kind to us. Me and Lars have had some good times together:)
@beephobia I'm grossed out by dirty feet too. But it was either play in flip flops or bare feet. I chose bare feet.
@_jamesy It didn't hurt until I poured rubbing alcohol on it
@Nick14383 soon
@CUERVOGOLD09 I'm not sure what we could do. But I wish you the best of luck:)
Playing football barefoot not a good idea http://twitpic.com/5t8nh
I'm going now talk later:(
@thegluelpfan yes. But she scares me now.
@pimwalun got it done. Maybe I should call every station
@SSjUmi that's true. It has become kind of stressful. I feel like if I don't say exactly what people want to hear than it becomes personal.
@LP_Ewelina I always tell people if they want us to write a song that sounds like a song we've already written. Listen to the original!!!
@A1ex757 haha:)
@futuresinmotion that's why I ask the DJ if I need to move back to LA to hear my song:)
@alexlp no
@Taylor510CE yes I did the DJ is a friend of mine
@MusicIsHealthy I gave it to the homeless
@Curiosafmmb I don't know what you're talking about. I usually don't tyt to offend people unless they're being offensive themselves
@junior403 Dexter and Tudors
@Lipizin I hope so
@jessi_LP yes
@Y4n_ChazyChaZ you guys should know by now that you can't judge what an LP record will sound like based on one song alone
@LP_nadine if every song was sang the same way. LP would be pretty boring
@LP_nadine those people can think what they want. I really don't care
@SdKent a little of both
@jannington I'll look into that
I'm not in LA anymore!
I have been listening for New Divide on the radio here in AZ, and I haven't heard it yet. So I finally called the request line:)
Gotta go I'm falling asleep:|
@frgt1O We will tour arround the world if we can
@Rock_cel it's never work and always awesome
@Missyeru I miss understood. My bad
@VernishaVillian I'm good. Kind of tired and irritable.
@chris6375 twitter isn't an invitation into everything I do. Why is it sad that I keep most of my life my own?
@chris6375 I don't understand. I do my best to let you guys know what I'm doing. Sometimes it's just not that interesting.
@Michaela1791 I'll do my best
The plugs in my ears are 9/16 of an inch. For example
The reason why some of you don't understand what I'm saying is because I'm responding to peoples specific questions.
@NamelessTheory true I'm not on facebook, unless it's on linkin park.com, chesterbenningtononline, or here @ChesterBe it's not real.
@theBG yeah my dick is less than an inch long... Dumb ass
@escara maybe
@Missyeru I have plans be formed as we speak to build my army of tweeters.
So if anyone wants to see us doing these performances you'd better try to get to the LP shows this Summer:)
@Irvine03 DBS will be doing Surise appearences arround the world. They will be short sets . And no one will know when or where they will be
@VernishaVillian yeah!
@francii_ We will be in Germany this summer
@Skyolker The Dead by Sunrise album will be released sometime around September:)
They are 9/16 of an inch
@liuliu_sc thanks
@xxdwarfxx Dont get weird please. I get get like 4 to 5 hundred questions a day. And I'm pretty busy. I try to respond to as many as I can)

@leila_LP nice
@igustavodc wise words
@UNICORNMONSTER We aren't metal, Oz Fest fans are metal. It's hard to play in front of an audience that doesn't want to see you. We killed!
@QuietShout I have 4
@Michaela1791 maybe. I'm not good at that kind if thing. That part of my brain was fried a long time ago:\
@chazyshay32 GreenDay does
@mrCollaborator I like PHM and broken and fixed.. downward spirals pretty good too

@louvau Dude, Suns will always be no.1, Lakers 2
@LinkinJoze I hooked up with Camp Freddy when Scott Weiland invited me to perform with them. After that they kept asking me back.
@o0msallie0o I'm sorry to hear that
@Timida713 it's a documentary
I'd prefer not to get involved with him, or communicate with him.
@SBWinner Dylan was never in a band with me. He's more of an aquaintance than a friend.
The Alzheimers Project on HBO is a real tear jerker. T and I just spent the last 10 minutes crying:(
