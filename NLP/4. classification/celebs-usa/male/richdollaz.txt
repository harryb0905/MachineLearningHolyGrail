@MissFuramera Have never labeled myself a creep nor have I even been a creep
@JonathanMayo @jimcallisMLB  yanks 30 list I must say very well done - If healthy I think Abreu is top 50 pitcher shoulda been n back of the 100 -  you’re higher on Schmidt &amp; Stephan Im with Gil &amp; king before injury but very well done guys- made my day going over the top 30
@BenBadler How good r the 2 Dominican kids the Yankees seem locked in with

Yankees positional player ranking n baseball  C - 4  1b - nobody  2b - 8  3b - nobody  SS - 10 RF - 1  CF - 4  LF - 2   pitcher - 8  RP - 8-7 coulda argued Bettances and Brittonfor ya top 10
@Amirkhary Yeah ok I’ve said that over 200xs  !!!
Affect is usually a verb, and it means to impact or change. Effect is usually a noun, an effect is the result of a change.  Common people step up ya grammar in 19
I liked Michelle Rodriguez before 10 minutes ago she shoulda shut the hell up instead of letting her ignorance shine through !!!
#Top100Prospects heard on a podcast u had E Periera on ya outside the top 100 list team how far away is cabello from Periera - @jimcallisMLB @JonathanMayo

Liam Neesom our here talking bout killing black folk cuz apparently a friend was raped by one - so I guess  rape and genocide of black folks for 100s of years gives me the right to do a radio promo run about killing white folks just curious
@BR_NBA @BleacherReport @FOXSportsSW Musta been super uncomfortable for Trey And whoever else was on podium listening to KP and not getting asked any questions
@ish_since89 @JonathanMayo This list is through my eyes I just feel Florial had a down year and the contact issues concerns me especially now heading into double A- if healthy &amp; that’s a big if Loaisiga is a 2 in ur rotation !!!
Yankee top 10 prospects   1 Loaisiga  2 Florial  3 Abreau  4 Peiriera  5 D Garcia  6 Cabello  7 Siegler  8 king  9 Contreras  10 Whitlock -Schmidt -Sauer - Acevedo - Estrada - adams -           Madina - Gil - Stephan   Volatile list lotta youngsters @JonathanMayo
@Amirkhary Facts - lol
It’s Super bowl Sunday are u allowed to visit friends eat and kick it without watching the game and wearing a Kap jersey ???
@sahluwal @drocktrot Shits so crazy out here right now I mean really crazy
@CNN Just switch over to Republicans he’ll be happily accepted freaking asshole
@utrippinalice @Bethany_Haupt What kinda dumb ass took the video and the commentary was absolutely insane bitch do t have time to stop or hinder a kidnapping fuck is going on in Texas is right
@Rap920 Free agents should be supplemental pieces have the talent add what u don’t missing out on positionally I have to assess the Knick roster but obviously KD &amp; kyrie are the targets but with this team maybe ur right putting ⭕️ in square pegs
@Rap920 Sad part this could be expedited with the drafting of Spider Mitchell over Frenchie Frankie add that to KD and u have something or even add him to KP u had something
@Rap920 I’m not a Fizdale fan at all &amp; I think they build thu the draft most importantly assemble a team that is cohesive &amp; built for the long haul Robinson - Trier &amp; Knox was a very good draft add that to Dotson , Noah and d Smith jr ur at least assembling talent with a top 3 pick
@Rap920 Dennis Smith is learning to play off the ball as he had to with Doncik this year but he’s a talent at this point talent trumps all - with a Top 3 pick &amp; a future first rounder I’ll take my chances - loved KP but he’s never healthy and quite frankly didn’t wanna be here
@Rap920 Gutted the team what exactly was the guy hardaway was over payed and actually not better then Dotson  lee hadn’t played all year and another contract gone and KP wasn’t the alpha player he’s a solid 2 not the franchise starter nor can he stay on the floor for a full season
Hey Fellas wake up knowing ya girl in the A in another dudes bed getting thoroughly tossed !!!
@GENTLEMENFOXX Love it
@Rap920 Kd - Kyrie plus the top 3 pick
@toss4life Def not as bad as u just made it seem wasn’t a great N.Y. Yankee type deal but we got cap room rid of a couple guys got picks and D Smith Jr
@DwaJay Yes KP didn’t wanna be here wasn’t gonna get true value for him not proving he’s healthy - shoulda picked D smith Over Frankie 2 years ago couple first rounders and cap space not bad - didn’t think KP was AD anyway
2019 I’m doing it my way anyone care to join me !!
@JoshWatkins1977 @JonHeyman U sound like an idiot saying Correa isn’t worth 5 million when the difference is 750k to a major league sports team
@TheNightcapTlj Baby who the hell glking bout babies I talk money no baby here
@JonHeyman Crazy how these owners nickel &amp; diming these guys
@CARandDRIVER @MercedesAMG When does that come out ??
In 2019 we can grow together or apart but ima grow !!!!

@keithlaw Touché this will be his year !!!
0 ⚾️ America   ⚾️  Prospectus -Loaisiga 64 / Florial 66   ⚾️  MLB Pipeline 2 Florial  66- Loaisiga 57   Keith law D Garcia 61 - Periera 101 Florial top 110  Yanks have 4 top 💯 types depending on who U  ask  D Garcia - Florial  -Loaisiga- Florial  with Abreau - Cabello in wings
@keithlaw I’m definitely a big Deivi Garcia fan but wow 61 &amp; Johnny Loisiga doesn’t appear at all so you have Garcia as the number 1 yankee prospect with Florial &amp; Periera  behind him on the top 💯 peripheral
@mamajeweldollaz @Oprah Go to sleep
Never been one for the fake shit so if u can’t produce in real life don’t pretend on social media , the Richie D hype train need the real deal save ya BS !!!!! Said what I Said
@eye_kandii &amp; vics versa
@SizweDhIomo_ @Chinaaa_Doll Anything less isn’t a friend
Yankees top 💯 ish prospects  Florial - Loaisiga &amp; Pieriera  I’m thinking good healthy  years from Abreau  , Cabello &amp; Siegler good put them right back n the prospect game !!!!
Wtf did Mariah just say I’ll run you over with a vehicle ?? Lmao that was classic
@bruthamarc Then Im Good w/o ☝🏾 cuz
@hunt4prospects Yeah he’s a beast as is E Periera but for now Florial - Loaisiga- Abreau - Siegler - periera - Acevedo - Whitlock - Deivi Garcia - then maybe cabello  just cuz of proximity to big leagues
@hunt4prospects Cabello super high for someone who just came state side last year
Mr.Monday night at 8pm tune in !!! Shits getting crazy if u were K would u take the plea the state offered or go to trial ???  Answer below lemme hear ya thoughts
@Chris_Broussard Ashy woul$ Azd ever approve a trade to NY much less stay ? Bit confused by that thinking clearly NY goes against everything he’s said to want most notably a winner
@NYSTAT3OFMIIND Yup done unless the price drastically drops on either of them yanks r done maybe a bs swig man pitcher Adam Warren type
No prospect trade has yet hurt the Yankees thus far I’m not high on Rutherford - Mateo is terrible - kap can’t stay on field - not so high on Fowler neither apparently is Oakland anymore - no room for McKinney - think these 3 if any will hurt Sheffield &amp; widener -guzman
@JonathanMayo 2 questionns today for ya 1 how far was Abreau from the top💯 is he only a couple graduations away - if healthy he’s still got 3 plus plus pitches upside of an ace n my eyes but prob a 2-3 &amp; are u high in Cabello - Pereria  &amp; D Garcia &amp; I’m talking Deivi not Dermis
@TMZ If only a few don’t make that trip says a lot about the Sawx
I can only put You in position to win I can’t win for u !!!!

@ItsMikeHill Zion is no where near the impact player Lebron was not even close - hops yesnof handles - vision - passing - scoring - lebron obviously had ball in his hands all the time Zion doesn’t create like brown did - no way not even close
@JonathanMayo No Albert Abreau 😡😡  Widener jumped bout 17 spots &amp; to think they gave himup for Bledoing Brandon Drury
Bout time to rekindle my friendship with @JonathanMayo - I dvred the top 💯 bout to watch this now should be interesting   Florial - Loaisiga &amp; Abreau fully expect to c them guys c y’all when it’s over
@meetmagazine Anytime you hear something feel free slide in my inbox ask I will, never lie never will that’ll eliminate all future confusion !

@Eric44140263 @BryanHoch Well ur clearly not a competitor I don’t anyone that’s walked into a gym or on a field at that level and said oh yeah they’re gonna kick our ass today - why we here playing this game
@BryanHoch Confused what he’s supposed to say ??
@Constance8News So let’s assess McDonald has the best fries already - now u add bacon so that’s a cheat code and cheese as well 🤦🏾‍♂️ no brainer - it’s called killing a whole generation ( genocide )

@680TheFan Braves are set up for quite sometime - money - prospects &amp; Major league talent !!! Problem is it seems like the NL east is getting stronger - Washington - Philly &amp; NY only Marlins r easy victories which doesn’t bode well for end of the season &amp; final records
@BleacherReport Does this mean I get to cohost catfish now ??
@Complex Confirming my original theory https://t.co/V7nZ0MeQbU

@SHO_RayDonovan might be the best show on television actually is the best show by far !!!! @Showtime
@CNN Damn where were these teachers as I was matriculating
@PeteRock @drocktrot She cut a rug all I c here !!
Yankees can talk that pitching shit all they want I watched about every game &amp; timely hitting &amp; Ks were much more of an issue along with terrible Sanchize Injured Judge &amp; Hicks - horrible 2nd half  Severino - no exhistent Bird &amp; bad Gardner no Frazier and still won 💯
@nubianangel27 You’d be broker then usual this week then
@ilygiovanna @ComplexMusic Of course ,  the funny thing is my genious wasn’t fully acknowledged moments like these are all the acknowledgement i needs - cheat on wife - nobody knows with who - mistress upset can’t capitalize no face or name with situation - fake apology - Complex gives u shine next up song
@nubianangel27 Watch on the 12th
Friday is here !!!!!!   U made it !!!!
@AndrewMarchand did k beat Francesca ??
@AndrewMarchand @nypostsports Still hating on ARod huh shit doesn’t get old for u guys ??

Hold up was busy lastnight just catching up on “ Star “ did she just have a black baby ??
Crazy https://t.co/v3Kt89rchU
@BaseballBros @ellennDaniellee Hoping Miguel Andujar turn is next
@TMZ Not sincere,  apology issued cuz nobody knew who she was and this was a creative way to be recognized get her name out in public - was sick of being some girl dude cheated with had to put face &amp; name with the deed how else would she make the blogs &amp; get followers - the end
@Chris_Broussard Def not winning 53 I’m still laughing
@Complex caught cheating ruin a marriage - people refer to you as the other girl never mention ya name so no real clout gained  - u get mad   u can’t capitalize cuz nobody knows its u that’s in this mess  - create a fake no tear crocodile apology that way who u are is made public -the end
@DonLagreca the caller that just called spoke about Levine  because these comment fall in line with the Betances comments a couple years back so it seems like he just speaks w/o thinking about consequences or repercussions- think 2xs speak once
@RealMichaelKay the caller that just called spoke about Levine like that because these comment fall in line with the Betances comments a couple years back so it seems like he just speaks w/o thinking about consequences or repercussions- think 2xs speak once
Happy hump day only 1 &amp;  a half days left before the weekend - yes 1.5 lol y’all know the second half of Fridays workday is spent thinking about &amp; pregaming for the weekend !!!!
@bigsantiago Sanchize 275 -280 ave - 35 homers -110 RBIs ops over 850 &amp; war around 4 and that’s with deficient D which means the O will be amazing - next season too offensive catcher n MLB save this tweet refer to it next October
@jaysonst not denying his year was historic but hyperbole aside he Was ok before last year and 1 year doesn’t sell me - I wanna c him do it again -but all things considered great pick up you are so right
@NEALWILLIAMS610 Well apparently yankees agreed with me 6 years and 140 when u can get happ for a fraction is silly
@bigsantiago Good thing ur not a prophet just a a yankee hater Sanchize toast at 26 nice try tho
@AstrosFansUK @jaysonst @OaklandAUK As had 18 games against angels - mariners &amp; Texas trash padded victory total wiped out by Yankees In WC
@AstrosFansUK @jaysonst What’s that mean when playing trash teams 18 times a year As - Mariners  - Angels
Yankee prediction   1-Sanchize has a great year  2-Bird wins 1b &amp; has a good season 3- Gleyber- Andujar continue shining  4- Machado signs  5- Stanton hit 45-50 homers  6- Frazier takes over left  7- Loisigna forces way into rotation  8- Acevedo becomes Betances 2.0 Yanks win 💯
Pitching depth is essential but valuing a 4-5 starter at 6 &amp; 140 milli is crazy - if u can’t put up 6-7 runs against a normal teams 4-5 then something is wrong with ya O !!!
Corbin goes to Nats that’s fine I’m cool with Machado - Happ Signing and going to war with Severino - Paxton - Happ - Tanaka - Cc with Loisigna - German - Acevedo - King &amp; Adams n the wings
@BNightengale Hmmmm
@jaysonst Can he do it again ?? NL east a lil different AL west was/is trash !!!
@wojespn So in reality he pulled n around 20 Million this year !!!!
@IAMBENZINO Up the block from the crib

@Bigbdog75 COmmon rich What fury won every round except maybe 3 was put down twice so those r both 10-8 and maybe 1 more 10-9 that left 9 10-9!rounds for him - fury won but the knockdown was ugly and that’s why nobody is beefing
@nynymary R y’all fucking retarded I clearly said fury won even after being out on his ass - 2 10-8 rounds didnt tie the fight up
@DripAnonymous What’s ya pointbmy guybibsaid he still won wtf u talking about
@CoryAlexanderVA he spelled it wrong bro triumvirate
@64lowridergirl Not condoning anything just playing devils advocate - if someone invades ya 4 feet of personal space man or woman u can’t protect yaself
@kylewshort @yooomitch @JosinaAnderson I dunno u think Big Ben gonna come forward for assaulting  women in bar bathrooms or naw fuck does KAP have to do with this
@heluva1983 Sad part is most veterans don’t even feel this way but u who have never fought for ya country is speaking for them
@heluva1983 Your lost really lost after all the hyperbole &amp; propagandau still don’t get it
@StandsReport @MadIsaiahThomas @BleacherReport Not a top tier D 1 he’s a top 20 player in his class but he took money so I guess we’ll never know  - he’s 6’7 pg def gonna have a shot at the pros
@Eric_M888 @jaysonst So 1 start 🤷🏾‍♂️ which they prob won’t use anyway at the beginning of the season
@KHausNY @jaysonst Cessa would be 4th starter in triple A but because of no options he’ll be n the bullpen - Loisigna - German - Acevedo - king - Cortes kids need a look when CC goes down not another free agent
@mamajeweldollaz Apparently a bunch of people everyday
@ilygiovanna She sound fucking ridiculous and she’s what’s wrong with everying n the world today ok I exaggerate
@IamRicoLove No argument 2 b had !!! You r right my guy !!!!!!!

@AllHipHopModels 😍
@ilygiovanna The good ole days
@marcusdj813 Florida isn’t as bad as Mississippi but never the less voter suppression was rampant - let’s c this new act allowing ex convicts to vote goes could change climate of Florida politics if it’s real
@willwright1974 The people in Mississippi don’t care bout the people in Mississippi why should anyone else - did u not see who they just elected senator ??
Mississippi reminds the US why it's:   50th in income 48th in economy 3rd in welfare dependency  50th in healthcare 50th in infant mortality  2nd in obesity  47th in education  50th in college readiness  47th in employment  7th in depression   couldn’t happen to a better state
Triple A rotation gonna be stupid Scranton - Loisigna - Abreau * - Acevedo - king - adams - Cortes   Might start Abreau n Trenton 2A because of injuries and didn’t get alotta work in 2A last year but will be n 3A before long
Yankees need Corbin - ( Severino - Paxton - Tanaka - Corbin - CC ) amazing rotation def top 2-3 !! With Loisigna - Abreau - German - Cessa  - adams - Acevedo &amp; king waiting n wings
@nytimes Mississippi I would’ve understood but in NY common ma - she clearly was ready to do something else with her life !!
@Topsheff42 top Sheff c u n 24 my guy &amp; get dat money !!!
@680TheFan @BFinn86 @steakshapiro @sportsandra National 🐫 toe day 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
@DSweetDaddy2348 Of course I’ve seen “ Mississippi burning “  as well as “ time 2 kill “ and you’re right Mississippi hasn’t changed much
Mississippi is a scary place Hyde - smith won but How could Repubs even allow her to run after the comments she made
The fact that woman won in Mississippi show why I’ll never go back to that state again - they might fuck around Abdul bring back slavery - but Mississippi will always b Mississippi I suppose

• You won’t find it with drinking. • You won’t find it with sex. • You won’t find it with money. • You won’t find it with material items.  • You will only find true happiness with God  • above thing are temporary
@ilygiovanna 😉 wake up to it
Morning peeps it’s Thursday another week just about done - we made it through another one !!!
@ilygiovanna Def false or we’d b looking at a recount common pay attention anything within 0.5 pct is a recount
@Skin_Diamond Dm me
@MayaBijouXXX Positive vibes
@JonathanMayo @MLBPipeline Is Everson Pereria in ya yankee top 10 and how far from ya top 100
@JonHeyman Exactly &amp; all the kids start n 3A when in actuality they should be fighting for the 5th spot Loisigna- Sheffield- Acevedo - king - Cessa even Adams deserves a look
@blackmike Indeed we have plenty of time but especially n Ga expect some fuckery
@blackmike I dunno can u - interesting to hear ya opinion on this
@brianmctaggart @jcrasnick So McCullers - Morton and keuchel all possibly gone sheeesh hope Whitley is ready
@Feinsand Big CC fan but yankees still need 2 of Happ - keuchel - Corbin - Morton  - Paxton -Kluber or Carrasco and this prob means if all healthy no kids start in the rotation and I don’t like that either Loisigna or Sheff deserve a look
So now yankees have 15 mill tied up in CC &amp; Gardy - 15 milli for the mentor program - still need 2 of Happ - Corbin - keuchel - Paxton - Kluber -  Morton &amp; I’m guessing all the kids start off n 3A Loisigna - Sheff - King - Adams - Acevedo
@AndrewMarchand Sounds like he’s open for the change - that should change everything !!!!!!
If u do not vote dont fucking complain !!!
It’s GO time people GO VOTE !!!!!
@ilygiovanna Yup
@ESPNChiCubs @Buster_ESPN Girardi time
@BillShaikin @Buster_ESPN And if he played D his war woulda been lower cuz he sucks n the field 57 games on D is not a mvp my friends
@bambiblackxxx Musta been a song u were reciting cuz the only shooting well nevermind .....
@yankees88063 @Kyle11081 @WeAre9PennState @Feinsand Why so u can have no money left of someone gets hurt - 2 pitchers let’s the kids fight for 5 if u need a 5th starter n the playoffs ya other starters suck
@Feinsand Gonna be hard the kids deserve a shot at 5th slot outta spring &amp; Yankees need 2 of Happ ,Corbin or keuchel so CC complicates things unless u don’t want Loisigna- Sheff - King - German - Acevedo or Adams with a shot outta ST
14 Tanaka an allstar *   15 Severino burst on scene   16 ROY 2nd place Sanchize after only 1/2 season Lil less   17 Unanimous ROY &amp; MVP finalist- Aaron Judge -Chad Green becomes “ a dude “  18 finalist Andujar &amp; Torres should be 1 &amp; 3 respectively but we will see   Homegrown core
@Yankeesnut74 Happ *
@Yankeesnut74 That’s my point u need both Hall &amp; Corbin but then CC has to go cuz the kids need a shot at 5th spot outta spring
Problem with Yanks bringing back CC is they still need 2 starters - CC &amp; Corbin essentially is same as CC &amp; Happ , gives them same rotation no improvement &amp; if u get all 3 u don’t give the kids a shot - bad move Loisigna- Sheffield - 👑 &amp; Acevedo deserve shots !!
BA top 10 yanks   1 LHP Sheffield 2 Of Florial 3 RHP  Loaisiga 4 OF Pereira 5 C Siegler  6 RHP king  7 RHP Garcia 8 RHP Contreras 9 OF Cabello 10 RHP Abreu  Not mad - I still have Abreau 4 but I get injury history - not so high on 👑 &amp; Acevedo if healthy is in - Thairo comes back
@loveindoe I want some
@JosinaAnderson Yes here they r down 8 with 2 left n the third
@ilygiovanna Really tho really - says the college educated girl

What y’all into tonight ??
I got Gillum in Florida hoping for Abrams in Ga but that is gonna be tough Kemp is cheating I’m sure &amp; if Beto wins Tx then wooooooow but he probably won’t !!!!!
My guess Dems take the house &amp; republicans keep senate !!!! Beats the blank they had I suppose , if you disagree tell me why ??
Dems need 23 seat net gain for control of The House &amp; The U.S. Senate has 51 Republicans &amp; 49 Democrats (including 2 indies). There are 35 seats up in 2018 - including special elections in Minnesota and Mississippi - of which 26 are held by Democrats. Dems need to gain 2 seats
@reneegraziano Damn neenee get some sleep

@JoeFrisaro @yanks98 Was the top catcher this year not anybtear previous stop it u sound nuts -
@JoeFrisaro @alejandrovg32 r u kidding me his stuff is insane and when if he learns to harness it he’s a #1 and yes Sanchize pitch framing and arm on par with JT only glaring weakness is blocking - Sanchize will have a 340 on base with 35 homers &amp; 110rbis all while throwing out 35 pt or runners then what
@JoeFrisaro FOH Sanchize stays much less add a lottery ticket that throws 100 ur losing ya mind !!!!
@rod_strickland Super dope hot rod u know I gonna make it out to big ten country for a few games !!!

@Joelsherman1 Evoaldi def isn’t 4- 80
@AndrewMarchand Pitching is the priority if they can get happ  , Corbin or both then Yes machado
@YankiYEURI17 @YankeesPR Yes winter league my bad baseball winter league nba summer league but point remains he’s 26 bro but I get the depth pick up no money prob assigned to triple A
@yankeesin2019 @YankeesPR He’s 26
@YankiYEURI17 @YankeesPR Ummm he’s 26 whats ya point I imagine if Andujar or Torres played n summer league they’d be pretty good as well
Barack Obama is a dynamic speaker woooooow mesmerizing  - don’t be Charlie Brown people !!!!!
A year of Happ &amp; Corbin is prob good for 6-7 wins puts Yankees back in a good place - Severino - Tanaka - Corbin - Happ - Loisigna sign me up Sanchez will be better have faith n 🦅- gonna miss Didi for sure / Stanton should be better Judge wont be hurt &amp; usher n red thunder
@YankeesWFAN Nobody is dumping on Gardner justvfelk it was an overpay which it was - he didn’t look good in the 2nd half period - could bought him out gave him 5 and called it a day
Whaaaaaaaaat the fuck just happened” how to get away with murder “ !!!! Best show on tv !!!!
@Jared_Grossman5 @Feinsand @Orioles They just started even thinking about signing international prospects they usually trade the money for rule 5 guys and give them back once they don’t make the roster - progress
@Feinsand Damn I wanted him n NY
Naw u heard right he said a rock and firearm are essentially the same - dunno if I agree https://t.co/jxdvOr6c3J
@JonHeyman U all on crack - so if baseball America jumped of the bridge You going behind them 🤷🏾‍♂️justvsayin
If u slide n someone dms &amp; shit don’t go nowhere why they gotta tell the next person “ ohh yeah girl he was n my dms 2 “ fuck u mean bitch I was practicing for the real thing
@ilygiovanna No legal only allowed 10 pct increase a year
@RobCezarNYC Naw let the kids fight for a spot not signing 3 pitchers - loisigna - Sheffield - German - adAms  - king and Montgomery when he comes back
@FaithSch Hmmm
@AndrewMarchand What does that mean ?? Signing Gardner was a next level move ??
@TONY313MONTANA Detroit the family  OGs !!!!
@JonHeyman @Feinsand Wtf so all this to save 2.5 million bucks he’s not worth new 7.5 shoulda got a 5 with the 2 buyout 🤦🏾‍♂️ not 9.5 in 19 !!!!
@JackCurryYES prob on vaca with the family but common man help me understand this Gardner deal - decline option - pay buy out 2 milli - bring back for 7.5 wtf are they thinking - so with buyout he gets 9.5 for a 4th outfielder
So the Red Sox spent 300k on alcohol at a boston night club after winning the WS - So every night was a celebration when BMF was around cuz I watched 300k get spent nightly when I was running them dudes around NYC  !!!!!

@AP Wooooow
From what I’m hearing Kavanagh isn’t out the woods yet - 2 senators vote could be waffling under pressure from constituents !!!! Ima hedge my bet with Republicans they don’t care what the people think or say - tunnel vision !!!!
Ex police officer new  present inmate Jason Van Dyke guilty of second degree murder !!! Chicago wasn’t playing !!!

@BaseballAmerica Lol this is a joke Miguel Andujar by landslide
Say what u want about the Repubs they stay the course !!! Once they support you nothing is changing that &amp; nothing is a deterrent at the end of the day the priority is getting what they want !!!
@slutsaucekhloe @LPizzle How many times did u fuck the dudes u delivered pizza 2
@bambiblackxxx 🤔
@slutsaucekhloe What’s ya private page I wanna visit and I’m from Ny
@BleacherReport @OlvinnO 50k people n a stadium expect some idiots doesn’t matter if it’s NY or not phili - Oakland - Boston doesn’t matter - ignorance + drunk = issues
6-0 do I stay with Robertson for 2 the. Chapman or stay with plan Britton &amp; Chapman 8 &amp; 9
Might wanna review my tweets I’ve always said records don’t mean anything - it’s how ur playing , when ur playing - think the Yankees can’t go on a run and win 12 of the next 20
@TitDeflatey @BNightengale Crazy
Ummm yeah so about this reliever that’s supposed to be so great ??
I get ron darling used to be a met but seriously these commentators are anti yankee and shouldn’t be doing this game
Talking all this shit about the A’s reliever and I’m willing to bet he gives up a hit !!!! Let’s bet
Sidebar with everything being said about Kavanaugh does he get voted in on Saturday or have the people spoken and A few Republicans listen ??
Lucroy wit a case of the Sanchizes
FYI Fernando Rodney sucks so I dunno why they acting like he doesn’t ??
@CrimMinds_CBS Deep
Andujar pissed he was taken out but how can u leave him n with the 2 bad throws n only 2 or 3 opportunities especially with no glove Luke at first
I don’t like Robertson n this spot I like Green after Dellin completes these 2 innings the Britton &amp; Chapman
@Fox_FZ6R @mikeygrogins1 @Joelsherman1 U shouldn’t make ridiculous comments - Romine is a back up for a reason relax with that romine shit like he’s actually ever not sucked n his whoooole career
@Joelsherman1 Hell no way to early giving up a possible 2 Abs from Andujar
@Way_of_Carlitos I agree chad green now maybe batter by batter if anything
@KingZito973 Well hidsight 20/20 but Severino did his job and Sanchez has looked amAzing behind the plate thus far - fuck Romine has no ceiling u dont play the back up n big games Sanchize is ya man - period
Dellin Dellin Dellin !!!!!!! Only thru 12 pitches do u bring him back out hmmmmmm 🤔🤔🤔
Who the hell is this broadcaster on TBS that clearly is on A’s payroll @JackCurryYES like seriously this is annoying listening to this guy stan the A’s
@LilUziAlex_TV He’s  actually very good look at the stats maybe as a catcher u were bad which is why he’s a yankee and ur watching
Severino feasting Next inning has to be batter by batter , I mean he hasn’t given up a hit yet if not for voit &amp; Andujar take away 15-20 pitches and this isn’t even a convo
Fucking Andujar &amp; Voit better come thru with the bat cuz the glove has forsaken them - fucking ridiculous 2 bad throws &amp; a ball that shoulda been caught - gotta sure up then corners , period
Damn already the baby only 2 months - guessing shorty couldn’t wait to hatch this smh or is this drama for the YouTube show my 13 yr nephew watches https://t.co/plYMx87tde
All Rise !!!!!!!!! Aaron Judge !!!!!!!!
Criminal Minds - empire &amp; star on DVR today - yankees on TBS win or go home Wild card game !!!!!
@MLBPipeline Damn Drury trade sucks Widener cracked the top 💯 &amp; they gave him &amp; Solak  up for Drury which turned into Happ - so Solak - Widener - Drury &amp; Billy McKinney for Happ
@slutsaucekhloe Yup all 58.1k of them
@KingZito973 The Sanchize is catching
@KingZito973 Who told u that lie A’s actually have worse average &amp; ops  n majors n pitches over 95mph
Big game tonight - AL wildcard need big games from Cutch , Judge , Hicks , Stanton ,Voit , Didi , Sanchez - Andujar &amp; Torres   Severino for 4 then Green - Robertson -Betances , Britton &amp; Chapman
@raiderway83 Definitely nervous bout tonight’s game
Here we go people !!!! https://t.co/3KCFUANbWU
@thatgrapejuice Who is she and why is Iggy touring - touring what

@bambiblackxxx As long as I’m one ☝🏾
Lol when Someone says i don’t usually do this it means they do just that quite often !!!
@JackCurryYES Indeed u have I cannot lie , y’all have been all over this !!!!
@BleacherReport And now he’s hooping n a random league playing against horrible competition prob not improving instead of being a top ranked HS senior with every college knocking on his door for the 1&amp;.done - great decision dad !!!
Bit shocked Severino is pitching the WC game -I guess long term he’s the ACE and needs to be treated as such -make amends for last years debacle - short short leash @JackCurryYES
So someone thought it was ok for these 2 women to act like this - u kidding me right ??!!!
another note Kavanagh headed down stream w/o a paddle Repubs allowing FBI to do w/e this week - taking bets on outcome   A- still becomes S/C Judge  B- doesn’t get the nod , goes back to appellate w/o issue  C- jail time for sexual misconduct  D - n/jail but loses judge for lian
Yankees should start Tanaka can’t get past needing Happ 2xs if they advance vs Boston   1 -Happ vs Sale  2 -Severino vs Price  3 -Tanaka vs who cares  4 -CC vs who cares  5 - Happ vs Sale
@mlovessamsmith End of November watch reruns right now

@hazelebaby 🤔
Ohh shit why y’all didn’t tell me L&amp;HH marathon been on ??
Among the five American League playoff teams, the Yankees have the best record against the other AL postseason qualifiers (22-16, .579).  Let’s the games begin !!!
Everyone loving  lil Wayne “ uproar” at least go get “special delivery” by g depso he can have some money on his books !!!
@BryanHoch If he doesn’t win ROY it’ll be a travesty !!!!
Lil Wayne is on course for a gold first week 475 - 525k with 155k in pure sales !!!! That’s so far could go up but at minimum he did amazing
@AngieB1966 I repeat the new season just started on Thursday how am I late - I caught it on Friday
265 homers torres  breaks Seattle record   20 homers from every spot n lineup - never been done before   45 doubles Andujar breaks DiMaggio rookie record   100 wins on season  Pretty good day for yankees
@Breezie10 One day late only ep I hadn’t seen was this season premiere
@AngieB1966 Just came back Thursday how Am I late seen every episode previous 2 that
@jseeger673 Meaning I been Watching &amp; was just was able to catch this seasons episode premiere
Just caught “ how to get away with murder “ shows fucking  amazing
@JoeFaceBecker Naw no worries they’ll b fine starting to click at right time remember how bad Sanchize was this regular season he’ll b that good in playoffs
First Em now Wayne can’t lie I’m not mad bout them guys being n heavy rotation - the old will always be new again - next up baggy jeans &amp; long white tees
So I’m guessing it’s safe to say Wayne is back with a vengeance!!!!
@DJMOS @RealSkipBayless Not really nobody cares bout his-opinion
People forget years ago Ashanti was gonna sign with cash money and ended up doing the mini label deal with E1 instead - how quickly everyone forgets or maybe it was just that long ago
Meaning nothing that happened today will deter the republicans from moving forward - but then I could be pleasantly surprised
@Ronturner10 U got my point wasn’t literal - saying nothing that happened today is gonna deter the republicans from moving forward
Kavanagh will be named judge tomorrow morning - kinda scary isn’t it !!!!
@hitmansteviej @Stevie_JII D1 hoops good shit !!!
@Bjays5 Who the fuck made a decision I said he’s falling apart paybattention and stay the fuck out my tweets with dumb ass responses
@WajahatAli @ilygiovanna Actually he’s rallying the republicans with this speech especially republican men
Lindsey Graham to the rescue !!!! Republican men will rally behind his comments only hope for Democrats is republican women see through the “ sham “ and the Cosby reference !!!
Call me crazy but Kavanagh if falling apart
What I’ve learned from Kavanagh  1 he played all the sports one can play  2 he likes beer - drinks beer - still likes and drinks beer  3 he documented everything in his life cuz his daddy did  4 the end
He likes beer , he still likes beer , yes he drank beer , still likes and drinks beer
@Xtrah1 He likes beer , he still likes beer , yes he drank beer , still likes and drinks beer
https://t.co/PCa5k4kh2e
@sportsandra @680TheFan @Entrepreneur @MWMcCreary Chick- fil - A is everything I’m not surprised one bit
Kavanagh is heated !!!
Crazy shit about this hearing is if u watch it on MSNBC he’s going down &amp; she was an amazing witness but on FOX she wasn’t believable and the Dems set this all up - long story short Kavanagh will be a Judge by Monday morning !!!!
@DeeLife1 Cory booker is very solid
@TMZ Just magnified his level of confusion
@JosinaAnderson That’s a good for the kneelers !!! He deserves a job
@YourVictoria_ I got u !!!
Cory Booker is def running for President in 20 !!!!
@JoeFaceBecker Falcons unfortunately
What y’all gonna do when Michael Avenatti runs for president ??
@JoeFaceBecker They better find that wave cuz they didn’t not look good right now
@JoeFaceBecker Gonna win tomorrow then 2xs n boston for 100
I watched “ Empire &amp; Star “ and I don’t remember shit from last season they shoulda played last season finally last week so I’d be refreshed
All of a sudden it’s 5 &amp; counting so before u say anything about Cosby let’s see the Kavanagh tally !!! Sexual predator(s) one headed down stream for 3-10 the other headed to the highest court for life
@justinawithaG Impossible choice
@JonathanMayo  -just saw ya inbox &amp; I been saying since the Drury trade I didn’t like it - Solak &amp; Widener was a lot  for a guy who was never better then Andujar in the first place - never understood the move now Widener in the top 💯peripheral  and Solak gonna be good as well
Still going with Tanaka in extra rest for the WC this game means nothing - go 5 get a tuneup then see ya next Wednesday
@BleacherReport @celtics Look like he a vice lord or gD  to me lik so y’all know I’m seeing gang signs
@CNN 🤦🏾‍♂️unreal !!!
And here comes Michael Avenetti the lisa bloom of mAle  lawyers
@ndrew_lawrence @JoyAnnReid Stupidest shirt ever kinda sad how women r turning on women
Just an FYI i trust Happ &amp; Tanaka &gt; Severino n a big spot - he’s never been good n big spots could be great when it’s all said &amp; done but for now he’s sucked n big spots

The good ole boy network that is the Republican Party is really something else - Lindsay Graham says “I’ll hear her out but I doubt anything she says is gonna change my mind about Kavanagh “ how bout he tried to rape me that doesn’t do it for u dog ???
@BryanHoch That damn head first slide into home is gonna fuck up alotta seasons - I get the run is right n front of u but damn
@keithlaw And we all know that guy was an oulier - unbeleviable
Understand I’m not condoning anything but r they gonna put Bill Cosby in jail &amp; elect Kavanagh to the highest court in the land ?? Don’t tell me how many women or what they did Just asking a question ??
@TONY313MONTANA Not just a pro bro common he’s breaking records in his first real season and I don’t mean rookie records
Boone makes no sense !!! has lead bring in A.J. Cole who promptly blows the lead so he must now use players he was resting so they can try and mount a comeback - terrible coach,  Boone ain’t it @keithlaw
Wooow Fox News who would’ve thought this !!! Finally some honesty https://t.co/G6R8RK8dFT
@TONY313MONTANA I def play madden and indef know it takes a QB to get them the ball in places to succeed so don’t down play his game - cuz Alex Smith def didn’t do this
@DaNickster79 Rich Dollaz could never be n flavor flav mode sorry not sorry
Ima say this again live I’ve been saying it from the beginning Aaron Boone isn’t an x &amp; o manager &amp; wil be severely out coached come playoffs !!!! Facts @JackCurryYES

Preach dat sermon den https://t.co/TrDhqNv3pI
Absolutely retarded to think happ would start WC game with Tanaka &amp; Severino pitching well especially with happ being lights out vs boston - common people think
@BaseballAmerica Have to agree he should’ve been def the best of all the Atl pitching prospects now that control has caught up to his “ stuff “
✈️ must b nice https://t.co/qsWWnC46gA
So many top 25 teams lost today can’t remember a shakeup like this in some time - college  🏈 crazy day

Yankees clinch WC , crazy thing is a 5-3 finish wins them 💯 that’s a lot of wins in any year   Braves win NL east    Should b very interesting this October &amp; beyond !!
Tiger shoots a 65 and has a 3 stroke lead - Golf sure is better when 🐅 is healthy and playing well - might even catch a sport center highlight !!! PGA tour say thank ur relevant again
That’s a lot of signings buddy &amp; I stated all of them were questions so no I didn’t say resign or sign anyone - all posed as questions with out the ? Mark sorry for the confusion
Yankees questions next season  1 resign CC  2 resign Happ  3 pick up Gardy Option  4 faith n the kids ( Loisigna &amp; Sheffield )  5 chase Corbin  6 what about mcutchen   7 trade gray  8 Andujar ya 3b or chase Machado  9 chase Harper  10 🦅 ya 1b  11 bullpen 12 what about Frazier
Sex work game must suck cuz I’ll be damned if I buy pics &amp; subscribe to premium snap with pornhub n existence - plus my DMs look well nevermind I’m talking to much
@LONGLIVEDONRON Don’t matter purse is 9 milli gets that ranking and confidence up for the majors only 4 of them a year - health is good he will b fine
@austinreidnj @BryanHoch If people cared about batting average anymore you’d be right but since they don’t his 9th highest and 20th best n Al &amp; MLB on base pct makes him allstar caliber a ready
Tiger is on fire today thru 12 nice 4 stroke lead here at Players championships !!!!  If he stays healthy he might come close to catching Jack
Congrats to the Braves for winning the NL East !!!! Now the real test
@altamuramarc Ur an idiot and now u blocked for being such an idiot
Naw he’s out gonna get more money somewhere else
@DRoweTax @Gord2100 @Yankees @YESNetwork @JackCurryYES Romine sucks knock it off period point blank he has no potential to ever get Abs anywhere everyone please stop
@Gord2100 @Yankees @YESNetwork @JackCurryYES Well considering he’s been batting 7th for ever now 8 isn’t much of a drop
@TommieLHHATL https://t.co/G4eSEtnSEJ
@680TheFan Braves r gonnna be a problem n the playoffs - I like them a lot of pitching shows up mostly bullpen
@rileyreidx3 Me
And I was just about to brag about my favorite minor league pitcher Johnny lasagna - but I’ll refrain since he comes n the game giving up bombs
Next years way too early NY Yankee rotation prediction   Severino  Tanaka  Happ  Corbin  Sheffield    3A Loisigna German  Cessa  Acevedo  King  Stephans - Swanson   2A Abreau  Whitlock  D Garcia
interested to c what Yanks do with staff - do they go get FA or do they value the kids - I say they make a run At Corbin - resign Happ &amp; or CC &amp; let  Loisigna - Sheffield - German - Adams - Cessa fight it out for the 5th spot @JackCurryYES
@rex_rexchapman Agreed !!!
@rex_rexchapman @MichaelRapaport Jelly fam before jelly fam
@MLBPipeline @JonathanMayo @Yankees @BryanHoch @swbrailriders @TrentonThunder @TampaTarpons @ChasRiverDogs @SIYanks @PulaskiYanks @Topsheff42 And quietly Deivi Garcia coulda made that list and people still don’t respect king and his stuff !!!
@altamuramarc Everything 31 pct Latina and 7 pct of black women voted for him so they clearly were the minority’s when whites women majority voted for him - make sense now
Wonder how that 53pct of white women that voted for trump feel now  !!!!! https://t.co/Ahj9qMZdbw
@rileyreidx3 I mean I would imagine u did that to yaself don’t wanna be asked to help with adding and subtraction don’t be a math teacher
Even after yesterday’s dud I’m going Tanaka in WC , Happ hopefully game 1 &amp; Severino game 2 vs Boston !!!! another dud next week vs Tampa &amp; my mind could change !!!  still saying yankees win 3 vs bmore 2 va Tampa and 1 or 2 va Boston sound like 99-100 win season !!!!!

@BryanHoch It will b shortly !!!! 🙏🏾
8-1 should be a perfect time for Sheffield to make his MLB debut !!!
Before the Yankee BX Sawx series I said they could beat Boston n playoffs still believe that - haven’t seen Sale since June and nobody else on staff scares me at all
thought this was an interesting fun fact the yankees have the 6th best era n ⚾️ &amp;  only behind houston - Tampa &amp; Boston n AL !!! Thought that was funny considering how much maligned  the staff has been !!!
@BryanHoch Tanaka has been on fire and Happ is inordinately good vs boston only makes sense !!!! Severino lined up for game 2 in boston If it exists
U gotta be fucking kidding me - is this not embarrassing that this is who represents us https://t.co/VsoFXJf7Eg
So the homie Plies got arrested n Tampa for having a gun n his carry on - I dunno whose packing these rappers bags these days but stupidity is reaching an all time high !!!! U cannot successfully sneak guns on ✈️ - how many will go down before I realize this
2 Early look at @ rotation - thoughts ??   Tanaka &amp; Sevy back !!   Do u bring Happ back - 🙏🏾  Do U bring CC back - 🤷🏾‍♂️   Do u bring back Lynn - 👎🏾  Trade Gray -✌🏾  Sheffield , Loisigna , German , Adams get shots n ST   Sign Corbin - 🙏🏾👌🏾👍🏾   Montgomery back - 🚑
@realOconnor614 @JonathanMayo I guess if You break down like that , they wouldn’t have had Drury so basically you’re trading Happ for Solak &amp; Widener - ok I’ll take it !!
I’m still pissed Yankees gave up Solak &amp; Widener n the Drury deal both r gonna be good @JonathanMayo
Finally Dems get a break with Kavanagh - Thursday meeting cxled guessing investigation into allegations are reason why !!!
Eminem's "Killshot" garnered the biggest 24 hour debut for a hip-hop video in YouTube history (38.1 million). From “ @chartnews “

Wow Pat Mahomes is kinda sick With it these first couple games !!!! 10 TD passes already !!!
@MLBNetwork 1 - 1 not even 1a u can’t go wrong
@TommieLHHATL Indeed piedmont pk first
Pissed off GGG got him again but still comes away worse off for it - 2-0 but record reads 0-1-1 boxing is insane never have a definitive answer I’m sure we’ll c three now - I hate boxing 🥊 seriously
It is proverbs that remind “ Do not boast about tomorrow , as u don’t know what  a day may bring “
Being completely honest I feel good bout the yankee rotation if the can Severino right   Tanaka WC   Happ 1   Severino 2   Tanaka 3   CC 4   I’d let happ go game 1 vs sale with Severino n 2 vs price
@drocktrot Nooooo
@CNN He waiting for the cable to come back on
@JosinaAnderson That was a set up the camera team def set him up
@BryanHoch Confused hasn’t he been on the bench ??

@JudgeGregMathis @MekhiPhifer Judge what up !!!
@TMZ Yet y’all dick riding and she said she paid for the cover - hyperbolic much
And this means what cuz he had weed in his house means u can “ mistakenly” come into the wrong house and shoot the guy u secretly had relations with - not understanding the importance of this report - but hey anything to discredit right https://t.co/LpVXnnwJ9C
Lets b clear if hott the Yankees can beat any team in baseball so spare me all the bs rhetoric , it’s not who u play but when u play them talk to me n 2 weeks
Enlight of what trump said today about Puerto Rico , it still baffles me how so many Latin American Astros went to the WH after the series -how retarded do they look now

Thibs definitely loves his old old players - he’s trying to sign them all &amp;  recreate that bulls team with all aging vets,  Noah your turn now kid
@Wallie1978 U make no sense if you’re protesting then you aren’t watching
@_Lesbianne_ Totally different show not even comparable
@Beautyis_Disney Naw retired
Braves look good and ready for a deep playoff run - still need a run at JT This winter - the farm is everything and JT is still relatively young they need that catcher -
FYI empire comes on next that’s what I meant of course if U watch both then u know that - empire premieres this month that’s my point get a grip
“ Power “ was amazing “ Empire “ step ya Game up !!

@ColeyHarvey Lol understood just messing witcha
@BrendanKutyNJ Why everyone who knows anything knows he isn’t goig anywhere 1 the sell would low and 2 he’s the best hitting catcher n baseball 3 he’s 25
@ColeyHarvey Can u actually be in cruise control after 2 hitters ??
@xoxo_jameer I live here now just wondering if these up north fall clothes r taking up unnecessary room n my closet
I wonder does hoodie ,jacket weather ever hit Florida while the suns up ,or do I just keep that type attire n my trunk for after dark change ups ??
@JosinaAnderson Oh he watched today’s game like everyone else if so that comment wasn’t a stretch
@680TheFan the abraves need to take advantage of the Phillies semi collapse and create distance - need some breathing room going into the stretch run !!!
If CC isn’t perfect he’s not good at all !!!
@Jesse__Foster Only a damn fool with Sanchez upside would want light hitting Romine and quite frankly his catching prowess is overrated
Next question I need answers for - does he layman ever watch men’s tennis I mean I know they make more money but when Serena is not on the TV screen does the non enthusiast actually watch ??
So let me rephrase this for he peanut gallery - KAP gets Nike 30th anniversary look so apparently the NFL kneeling - Presidential SOB boycott is over ??!!

@realOconnor614 @JonathanMayo @MLBPipeline @DylanCease @whitesox @scottmerkin @BhamBarons @WSDashBaseball @KnightsBaseball @Intimidators @gfvoyagers Indeed I do
@JonathanMayo @realOconnor614 @MLBPipeline @DylanCease @whitesox @scottmerkin @BhamBarons @WSDashBaseball @KnightsBaseball @Intimidators @gfvoyagers Thinking Results King is def comparable but stuff wise people would say Cease is a better prospect - my guess is king jumps up the Yankee 30 prob / maybe top 12-15 maybe even top 10 but not top💯 overall until he kills 3A next season and minimum 2 out pitches
@BleacherReport Slowly but surely getting back !!!
@TonyGaskins Need a signed copy Tone
@BallersHBO @HBO My favorite show !!!
@thejasminebrand The question isn’t would she take it back the question is would he want her 2
@CNN No slander n the truth my friends !!!!
@CNN Ate bad box
Cory Booker is absolutely playing chess not checkers !!!!!  Repeat after me 2020 !!!
Not sure it’s wise that the guy u chose to be the anti KAP would’ve n fact been the first to kneel had he not been killed by friendly gun fire &amp; had the incident covered up by the government- just saying #PatTillman
Lol @CoryBooker is acting up good to c the Dems finally stand up and fight the way they should’ve been for quite some time now - document leaks why care if u have nothing to hide - no national security In question just a cover up
@BNightengale Yeah what he did when he was healthy
So apparently u can hit homers &amp;. need Tommy john - Otani with 2 tonight after being told he can’t pitch anymore and suggested TJ
Braves hurt my heart today &amp; let the Rwd Sox steak that Game !!!!
@Rosenbergradio of course he can come back next year and bat - Gleyber torres just had TJ last year and was back for spring training

@680TheFan They still need JT and this team becomes a juggernaut
@altamuramarc @iamMaddieMey Guaranteed they recover
@JonathanMayo any word on who has been promoted within the minors Yankees Double &amp; Triple A teams are still active Im sure Abreau - Florial - Garcia have been promoted amongst others
In case u thought Nike was moving blindly - thanks @iamMaddieMey https://t.co/navsTyi3sT
@680TheFan If they didn’t give him a shoe that would be horrible marketing &amp; def not capitalizing on the aforementioned endorsement deal and we both know based on this deal Nike is both strategic &amp; in tune the Kaps 7 would / will be iconic &amp; rival the adidas Yeezy !!
Imagine this team for a second -  C-Sanchez  1b - Andujar  2b - Torres  3b -Machado  SS - didi  Lf - Gardner / Frazier  Cf - Hicks  Rf - Judge  DH -Stanton   Man I can dream can’t I
@altamuramarc Might b right
Race for the rotation next season gonna b crazy , locks r Severino &amp; Tanaka with CC on petite 1yr cycle do they bring back Happ ?? or let Losigna - Sheffield - adams - Acevedo - Cessa - Swanson - king fight it out not to mention at some point Montgomery comes back
I mean happy Tuesday excuse me still n holiday mode

@TommieLHHATL The talk show ?? Stop it Tommie just stop !!!
Ok Keith I’m back lol yesterday we discussed Garcia but apparently today Abreau threw 5 no hit innings n Trenton &amp; Mike King has turned into a beast in Scranton , I know ur high on Albert but what about King has he morphed into something special or all quad A hyperbole
Yes indeed 3 day weekends rock - rolls over closes eyes !!!
@JonHeyman Common bro really r we really even pushing this narrative othani def hasn’t done what Andujar or torres for that matter have done - stop it
So damn is Angela gonna snitch ??? Monster tv show damn next week gonna b insane !!
@keithlaw Damn even at 19 what is his ceiling for u - I get a 2- 3 with uptick is that accurate
Damn I can’t front “ power “is fucking amazing !!!
@keithlaw Deivi Garcia throws 5 no hit innings n double a debut - he’s the truth Keith the absolute truth
Serena Williams is amazing ok back to ya Sunday evening !!!
I love Miguel Andujar think he’s ROY and gonna be a perennial all star but he has NO range at third
@680TheFan Need him back ASAP he fortifies the back end of that bullpen
Without Corbin or Kershaw - Yankees rotation next season should be   Severino -pre arb  Tanaka -2 yrs left  Happ - one year reup might get more elsewhere lettem walk  CC - one year reup  Loisigna - rookie  Sheffield - rookie  German -
Today’s news Yankees suck Nadal is gonna win a tough one Serena comes in at 3:30 - Acuna is a beast and Tiger is playing decent today 6 off be lead thru 14 you’re welcome
Is t Johnny Loisigna back why am I watching Lance Lynn struggle vs the Tigers
@Htxbia Called love ❤️
As it stands today I’d rather play Boston before houston and especially before a healthy Josh Donaldson added Clev - Boston is good no doubt but they don’t scare anyone pitching is mediocre beside Sale and he’s never healthy
@ColombianFash Make it 11
Heard Ems new album yet ?? What’s the good word ??
@JackCurryYES Do u think this was a good trade with Clint starting his rehab assignment ??
Mcutchen hmm Avelino wasn’t gonna play &amp; Depaula is a 4 at best right now , so I guess giving up 23-26 prospects doesn’t kill ya but damn what does this say bout Judge @ Frazier being healthy - can’t imagine this being done if Clint was on way back wouldn’t make sense would it
Yankees blow lead Red Sox come back sounds about right !!!
Damn Dellin !!! Blew the save &amp; the game all in less then 12 pitches smh - meanwhile Boston Losing to Miami !!!!
@JonathanMayo woooow this Michael King kid is pretty damn good threw  6 innings of 0 hit ball today &amp; is looking like a future 3 @ minimum a couple more tics which the Yankees have been known to help with  - ya thoughts
Aaron Hicks legit might have the best bat drop / flip watch homer go out in the whole MLB its amazing !!!!!
You’re a beast - Touki Toussaint make it look easy for @GoStripers: 6 IP 3 H 1 R (0 ER) 2 BB 7 K No. 7 on the #Braves Top 30: https://t.co/qjUW2CfaCI
Aaron Hicks might be a top 10 center fielder &amp; one of the most underrated players n baseball also remember he came over for John Ryan Murphy , exactly who ??
@TommieLHHATL Shrimp
The best way to secure opportunities is by making sure others have opportunities !!! Morning tweople

U and I both https://t.co/fBnOJNiNrK
@680TheFan Needed that game damn it
Braves blowing an opp tonight losing to Miami while Toronto’s beating Philly smh gotta take advantage of these games extend that lead
Games against the Orioles shouldn’t be this hard
Just can’t get a grip on the Baltimore - Yankee thing - literally can’t beat the worse team n baseball on pace for 115 losses - @JackCurryYES this is completely bizarre
So Vince Carter is still hanging on In the A smh
@Joelsherman1 Does anyone care
Lol Vandy vs middle tenn next week ,  my daughter Ashe goes to MTSU she can now experience the power of the Commodore !!! &amp; it’s in the ville might make that trip !!!!!
My vote Serena doesn’t play n French open wait for England - Austria &amp; Queens NY take them 3 well call that the Wakonda Slam
Kinda random but French open banned Serena Williams black wakonda body suit they said it was  un French open like - I need a definition of what’s in French open what r the new clothing  guidelines
Omarosa &amp; her tell come in at #3 on NY Times best seller list @ 34k - guess y’all wasn’t pressed to hear her come for trump !!!
Thought this was interesting https://t.co/hlyi5BuRNc
@ilygiovanna Might wanna evaluate the guys taking u out - dinner 60 - drinks 60- parking 40 - hookah + 1 refill 45 - movie +🍿 + 🥤 60 and movie light don’t go to a club that’s another 200 easy
Don’t worry bout others - run ya race at ya pace !!!
@Chinyeree__ @ilygiovanna I had that same problem
@rileyreidx3 👀
@680TheFan He’s a beast best rookie n majors soon to b a top 30 player
@BNightengale I mean he got a check I’m sure he’s happy - why wouldn’t he be he doesn’t get paid per healthy / quality start dat mooolah guaranteed , he’s rich biiiiiiiiiitch
@MercedesBenz Bro nobody cares bout all that just tell me when the 19 wagon comes out this is getting ridiculous
@Jess_Nneka @Bossip I’m sure she has all kinds of mascara and stuff left over for problems such as these
Not ok with Kopech using the N word but in its context it’s defendable as was bisbuse of Gay don’t think either was in a racist or homophobic rant - this is ya 1 free pass killa
@SdotJoe Lol they don’t have to beat them all just 3 of them mariners won’t be around Red Sox don’t scare me at all I wish they could play them n WC now clev ,houston &amp; Oakland playing like they have been make me nervous -the question is will Oakland crash and burn in sept
@SdotJoe I live n Decatur Ga &amp; u can soon catch me on Wfan talking braves - hawks , UGA , sec sports &amp; kennesaw state hoops with that Said Yanks will be fine I prefer a slump now &amp; hit stride n Sept / October they’ll come together but am i nervous yes - 1 Game playoff should scare anyone
@KINGROME12 Lol expectations matter bro can he live up to the pick - huerter is 6’7 can shoot lights out and will sneak up on people think ball &amp; kuzma dynamic
@TommieLHHATL Ready for sessions 1-3
Thinking bout hawks basketball 🏀 call me crazy but Kevin huerter is gonna have a better year then Trey young
@yaboy1878 U just made my point CC is ya number 4
@yaboy1878 Over who Happ is the best pitcher Severino is ya ace unless he looks nasty n coming weeks he could lose his spot and Tanaka is Tanaka
Man wtf is Aaron Boone doing seriously - he makes so many bad moves it’s comical - seriously mark my words the playoffs will be a disaster if they get by the 1 Game playoff - he will be out coached severely
@JackCurryYES ummm common Jack why is Chance Adams n a 5-3 game ??? I mean why outbthat type pressure on the kid ??
@yaboy1878 U can’t go CC or tanka homie never gonna happen and Evoaldi looked good first couple games been getting shelled last few
@Conner65449298 Good thing about being grown
@JackCurryYES is Robertson available &amp; why is Kaye acting like the Yankees can’t use everyone n the pen when tomorrow is an off day - kahnle - holder - Betances should all be available
Fuck guess u can’t compliment Lance Lynn fuck he gave up a 4 spot to the marlins Smh
Does everyone still think the Evoaldi trade was a better look then Happ or Lynn ?? If playoffs started today out respect CC gets Game 4 but Lynn will get a game 1 Happ or Severino 2 Happ or Severino 3 Tanaka 4 CC 5 Lynn
Atl Braves Acuna hands down rookie of the year n NL and NY Yankees Andujar in the AL -
@JackCurryYES Neither Britton or Robertson have looked good Britton has actually looked bad think it should be Betances
@hazelebaby 🤔
Where is all that Nathan Evoildi chitter chatter now - best pick up , turned the corner , pitching like a top of the rotation guy stop he’s Nathan evoldi
Yankees going down like flys - I imagine betances will b closing for immediate future
@BlkAshli Dunno bout that
Yankees should b ashamed of themselves !!!!
@BravesRadioNet @680TheFan @Jim_Powell Finally a Dansby sighting
@BlkAshli Yup they need him
Where is all that Nathan Evoildi chitter chatter now - best pick up , turned the corner , pitching like a top of the rotation guy stop he’s Nathan evoldi
This is the Yankees time to make some ground including tonight next 6 vs Miami &amp; Bmore gotta take all 6 5 minimum while Sawx are n clev &amp; Tampa
Deivi Garcia is the truth @keithlaw pitched great again today after winning FSL player of the week
Shits hitting the fan in the dumpy trumpy admin now senate acting at break neck speed to solidify his Supreme Court nomination - shot gets funnier by the day - if for no other reason at least pretend to care about America
@TommieLHHATL Got u !!!
Even after being swept the Braves r back in first cuz the Phillies have been even worse !!!
I gotta get in a JLo &amp; Alex relationship. ,  seriously if you don’t have that u don’t have anything !!!!
@HonElihuSmails @BrendanKutyNJ Not like he’s lying - we all know Bird is better at first then Austin but Austin is no slouch and if hot when hott he can put up numbers the Yankees would like to finally see outta Bird
@SNstats If people knew About him from his minor league days they’d know he’s always been a great SeCond half player
@keithlaw All is relative my friend I don’t necessarily agree but most would say they don’t make millions to play a  game or in ⚾️ case half mill before arbitration
“ Ballers “ was dope tonight !!!
@680TheFan This sweep really hurt Atl this was a chance for some separation with Mets &amp; Sawx beating up on Philly but instead they lost ground !!!
No “ Power “ but “ Ballers “ alive &amp; well so the nights not a total loss !!!!
Why no power tonight ??
I like JA Happ n the WC  game vs Oak or Houston or Game 1 if Severino gets locked in and gets the WC call !!!   Happ - Severino - Tanaka - CC - Lynn   Severino - Happ - Tanaka - CC - Lynn   Tanaka - Happ - severino - CC -Lynn   WC &amp; division series which rotation u going with ??
Heeeeeeelarious https://t.co/sO2zM1cYFZ

@ems6500 Ratings
Got the besty co-sign I think we on our way !!!!
@TommieLHHATL Yup
73 pct increase in this weekend PGA tourney final round - let’s call that no with out a doubt the Tiger effect !!!!!
@thatgrapejuice Where is she at n sales
By the way the braves are the 2017 yankees they will be playing n October of Acuna doesn’t miss major time after the sucka move by Uranus today
Much more afraid of Astros - Oakland can’t hit n real life
But don’t let any of this distract from the fact Sheffield is still n triple A !!!! Why I don’t know 🤷🏾‍♂️
@MLBNetwork Jt should expect the same / same energy from Braves pitcher
@680TheFan Sucka move kids done nothing wrong didn’t deserve that JT should be expecting some chin music ASAP
@JonathanMayo How do you feel about Nolan Martinez is he the real deal if healthy ?? He’s been pitching well this season .....
Everyone’s worries about Judge coming back n 3 weeks 1 the Yankees aren’t catching the sawx (2) As or mariners aren’t that good (3) everyone get healthy for the September run go into playoffs hot n good shape and they’ll be fine
@hazelebaby I wanna put that tummy on swole
@Braves @680TheFan Fun !!!
@swbrailriders @JackCurryYES  Sheffield was pulled at 1-2/3 innings after giving up 4 runs - not injured right ??
@keithlaw I know pizza is the topic but Sheffield was pulled at 1-2/3 innings after giving up 4 runs - not injured right ??
@ralphieaversa @JackCurryYES @PinstripeLanes Love &amp; hip hop meets yes meets my guy from syracuse doing big things n the city of dreams
@JackCurryYES Damn , yeah I missed it rushing home got home mid 1st
I repeat in this very moment 3.5 games up in the first WC spot 5. Up in second does Happ get the ball ???
So in this very moment does JA Happ pitch game one or wild card ??  @JackCurryYES
1 word to describe Acuna Jr. Woooooooow 3 straight lead off dinger 5 straight games NL rookie of the year over Soto
Yankees 74-44 &amp; Mets 50-66 split subway series and u wonder why Boston  has a 10 game lead
Mets haven’t scored 7 runs In 2 weeks but that have 7 tonight thru 7 !!!! unbelievable
Def wanted today’s yankee game to be rained out !!!!! Don’t feel so confident
PGA tour ratings up 20 pct this weekend - all Tiger all day as previously stated a hand written letter to him saying “ thanks “ changes , transcends the sport like nobody else ever has
@680TheFan He deserves it has had a total turn around this season with his control &amp; stuff was always ridiculous
Ohhhhh yeah “ ballers “ is back !!!!!!
@NYY1996BR @AndrewMarchand Exactly what he was saying and everyone knew that but for asshole reasons acted like the comment didn’t make sense made all the sense in the world
@mortgageguyforu Facts
@altamuramarc No punctuation on twitter it’s a run on lifestyle
I repeat golf is a different animal with 🐯 🐅 healthy &amp; playing well !!!!
Has no range can’t play the corner def can’t play up the middle
@JackCurryYES what Michael Kay just said was the dumbest thing I’ve heard n quite some time - one day doesn’t make u hott as if anyone could be hott w/obplaying multiple days
Here’s my suggestion miguesl Andujar pick up a first basemen’s glove this winter when he goes back to the Dominican
@slutsaucekhloe Sexy
Stanton “ is this the run u been waiting for are u not entertained !!!!! “
@shaunking @TheLatifah Wtf  was playboy thinking
Lol facts right facts tho
Howd Kay not mention Sanchez just now ,he came up late totally crushed everyone prob shouldve won Rookie of the year over Fullmer -then judge comes up wins now Andujar &amp; torres 1 &amp; 2 - that’s not even mentioning Gamel rooking year with Seattle was a yankee prospect @JackCurryYES
@Vinman23 @JackCurryYES No maybe u need to check his number over the last 25 + games
Just a quick point all the people talking about how good Evoaldi has been n Boston u do know Lynn has been just as good in NY right ??!!!!  @JackCurryYES
@LILPIXIE29 And Yo lil don’t go with ya fat ass and u should never take a pixie ever wit yo ugly ass - always the ugly fat ones do the most chirping
The PGA tour should write Tiger Woods a hand written Thank u letter because w/o him the casual person could give a shit about Golf !!!!!!
@ImTheResilient1 Dumbest shit I heard tonight
@MisssAmberROSE Wtf does that mean ??
Looking like Touki Touissant the most upside of any of the brave pitchers on the farm is getting called up for the double header !!! Congrats homie
@jwerz @kevin_brownnn @JackCurryYES I would still want a guy who is 329/380/557 in his last 22 to be in there.
@Yankeesboy26 @JackCurryYES Not about fans wanting him out here it’s about the alternative and yes he is hitting now so why not ride the hot bat
@JackCurryYES Yeah a lefty with a 4.54 era not like he’s facing sale just don’t get it
@MG_eaglelion @JackCurryYES Bottom line u don’t hit 2 homers and sit down for Voit batting mid 300s lately and finally getting ya timing down and confidence up
@MG_eaglelion @JackCurryYES Make sure u have this energy tonight when he’s 0-4 with 3ks with his 190 average becoming 160
@jwerz @JackCurryYES If u think the guy and his philosophy have the Yankees 30 over ur crazy and not really baseball savy the Yankees have won many games in spite of the coaching and yes I watch them all
Can u explain Boone &amp; this mentality I have a switch hitter thats red hott just hit 2 homers yesterday &amp; I sit  him today - I just can’t understand this guy &amp; his philosophy he backs up first just fine as well  @JackCurryYES
Already short handed with injuries to Sanchize &amp; Judge &amp; a terrible x &amp; o manager now he’s handicapping the team with lineups as well unbelievable
This is what I mean when I say Boone is a terrible manager again a lineup with Robinson -Romine &amp; walker in it -  just because he escaped last night doesn’t mean do it again - Stanton should be n right If torres needs a day it should be a half day !!
@CNN Well he said what they all are thinking don’t think this is surprising in the least bit
@keithlaw Lil hard on sauer who has admittedly been n a Lil slump but he’s better the The game u saw I’m sure of it
Thought of the day “ never say anything behind me u wouldn’t say  in front of or next to me “ !!!
@UnitedWhofans No I’m saying don’t play Romine - walker - Robinson on the same day ever
Morning world
Disappointed in “ Suits “ tonight !!!
@longislanddon @JackCurryYES Walker should be on the team he’s playing well Robinson - Voit shouldn’t be sniffing MLB right now Torreyes &amp; Wade can come up for them as walker continues to back up first Wade get reps n OF when Stanton needs break &amp; Torreyes backs up IF
@Flech_Tera What they shoulda done was give him 4milli last year to rehab &amp; kept him from going to Tampa n the first place
@jomanado Didi gets half day DH , Stanton n right &amp;  walker at second would’ve been more formidable !!! never a lineup with Robinson - Romine &amp; walker on same day !!!!
@jomanado Don’t care about days off Judge is hurt Sanchize is hurt &amp; can’t have Romine - Walker &amp; Robinson in the lineup at same time
@UnitedWhofans And when u say who do I want how bout starters for one or u just replying to reply
Don’t care about days off Judge is hurt Sanchize is hurt &amp; can’t have Romine - Walker &amp; Robinson in the lineup at same time
Wtf is with Boone and these lineups Yo he’s a terrible manager seriously terrible Yankees can’t have romine - Robinson and walker n lineup
@JonHeyman How crazy is that ??
Severino really bad lately   Tanaka  really good lately   Happ - should be better here then n Toronto only 5-6 quality outta him won’t be pushed like n Toronto with bad bullpen   CC - if not perfect on corners &amp; up and down he’ll get smashed    Lynn - workhorse should be aight
@JackCurryYES at some point u gotta start taking AJ Cole serious so far no high leverage situations but he’s pitching to a 1.75 he’s an  ex bit tyme prospect so obviously he was respected at one point - maybe that Adam warren role for now ??
Yankee fans like Lynne is the ace we been looking for - lol - pump the breaks but he did look good tonight coulda used him n Beantown
@keithlaw shoulda went to c D Garcia &amp; his 7 Perfect tonight instead of Matty Sauer - the just turned 19 yr old pitching n high A today was prob called up for the second half of double dip &amp; prob sticks around now what u think ??
@JonathanMayo guessing D. Garcia will make next weeks team of the week just turned 19 yr old n Tampa hi A today pitched a perfect 7 inning game 94 pitches !!!!
@keithlaw @SIYanks Yikes no bueno I prefer Whitlock  , Garcia - Medina - Abreau ,Contreras but I’m pretty sure he’ll shut them down and end 6 innings and them same 2 runs allowed
@keithlaw @SIYanks I dunno isbthat good or bad ??
So hold up Safaree messed with well nevermind  - hey @JoeBudden ummmmm am i seeing what I think I’m seeing in this TV screen
@Skysymone___ I dunno know u so let’s keep it simple
@chartdata What history does Nicki &amp; Trey have y’all sayinfbrheaw numbers were because of her and how did CIARA get n this convo
Yankee fans take solace in knowing the Sawx will not maintain this pace - it virtually impossible &amp; rest assured the As aren’t that good either but the Yankees do need another run 35 - 18 run will have them back in the mix at the end
A lil pool action today https://t.co/39LMcIbUGY
How’d y’all feel about “ Power” tonight ???
@noemadnyc Thank u my brother !!!
Waffle House !!!!!
@FamousBirthdays Thank I for the well wishes
Yankees suck no other way around that maybe they’ll be good again tomorrow or next week but since the break they’ve sucked period
Yeah wild card it see u n September cuz this AL east race is over boston prob won’t collapse
Chance Adams had a decent game not great decent 3 runs over 5 I can live with but if u score 0 ur gonna lose 100 pct of the time - don’t tell me they don’t need Judge &amp; Sanchize n the lineup watching Romine &amp; Shane whatever hurts
Wild card it is !!!! Yankees look like a  terrible miserable team - it’s a long season every team has slumps but not sure they can turn around 7.5 games against boston then have adams going tomorrow very well could lose all 4 but hoping for a split
Looks like the braves have the third baseman of the future !!!! Camargo the truth !!!!!!
All the Sanchize chitter chatter has romine caught a runner stealing this year - whatever happened to Gray being Gary’s fault lotta live service but time told the truth
Boone is botching this up terribly defending plays - players blaming others etc etc botching this up big time !!! He’s terrible like really terrible
@BenBadler I’m amgueasi g cuz u didn’t say a number next to his name he wasn’t a top 30 or 50 kid
@TommieLHHATL 👋
Actually the only thing I watch on WE Tv is CSI Miami reruns !!!!
@daze11 Not trading him
@BNightengale Lethal today killa not everyday I’d take yankee top 9 over Sox top 5 any day - when healthy Gardner - Judge - Stanton - Didi - Sanchize - torres - Andujar - Bird - Hicks
@MLBPipeline @MLB @jimcallisMLB @JonathanMayo @AJCassavell @scottmerkin @gregorMLB @BryanHoch @m_sheldon @RhettBollinger Is this top ten ranking including the new international kids
@robinlundberg Everyone does realize season series is 5-5 I dunno that seems pretty equal
@ace078 Indeed -point made , that easily kinda disgusting how the  ole boy network treats men of color n the 🏈
@MistyHPettway08 @EAMaddenNFL @Kaepernick7 Lip service people def won’t stop something they want for the cause - Tv still on everyone’s tv sunday afternoons
Braves u have my undivided attention !!!!
Total collapse very disappointed in the Yankees in good c u n October hopefully they don’t freeze up &amp; move on I’m not so confident
FYI this is the one they needed to Chris Sale Game against a random reliever type but prob not gonna get it now , advantage boston
Yankees suck bro plain and simple not watching this shit - I swore they were better then boston after tonight I dunno - boston looks like the better team plain and simple
Wtf is holder thinking then Andujar can throw a strike home - ya seriously the Yankees play bad baseball at times like wtf is with this brain freeze shit
Shoulda started CC in this inning bottom of order Boone is a terrible manager so far !!!!!!
Outrage over Kaeps name being taken out of video game song EA puts it back n - is it too late or y’all cool with the apology and reinstatement
@IamPeterGunz Very unfair
@JonathanMayo how bout Nolan Martinez today 5 innings 0 hits 0 walks 7ks - he needs to be promoted to Charleston asap wasting his time pitching to a 1.23 - 8 games n Staten isle
Damn I want 🌮 🛎 !!!
@MiLB Way to much time on hands
@AndrewMarchand Black Thursday coming soon unfortunately- no breaking new just copying stories internet plagiarism
@_Smoke_Saunders @darenw @JesseSanchezMLB @MLBPipeline top 2 or 3 Gms n the game &amp; Yankees have about 4-5 kids at lower levels that will be top 100 coming soon
@Moneyman4lyfe_ @Stoooopsy @fzlongotoon @BenGoldenthal @darenw @MLBPipeline Guzman was top 100 by who ?? He will be but hasn’t been yet !!
@CrystalVTyson I’ve seen studies that say 20 pct less attractive so I dunno thisbis debatable “ Uber fact “
@680TheFan He’s a beast man Braves r set up for a long time - dunno what to make of dansby seems kinda regular right now but as this team grows I guess ok and steady is not a bad thing
Yes in Didi - in Didi we trust etc etc 3 run bomb n top of first CC has breathing room !!!!!
Braves have a top 3 farm system with 2 - 1st round pics n next years draft a top ten for not signing anyone this year and a hi teen lower 20 depending on how they finish this season !!!
What a day for pitching on the Yankee farm - Sheffield  n 3A - Stephan n 2A - R Garcia n HiA- Nolan Martinez n Staten Isle &amp; l Medina n Pulaski woke big day
@ADipichiwitz so r we ok with the Dansby Swanson experiment being over ? Or are u ok with the left side as is for a championship run ?
@ADipichiwitz Def not just fine he’s a kid could def get better but defensive metrics &amp; almost avg offense don’t make it just fine when they have a farm that could get them better not to mention Swanson is worse at SS so take ya pick
@MLBPipeline @JesseSanchezMLB @Yankees @BryanHoch @swbrailriders @TrentonThunder @TampaTarpons @ChasRiverDogs @PulaskiYanks @SIYanks whose the bird kid they announced I only c 2 names
@Flech_Tera Facts hopefully next turn thru he will get this slot
@YankeesPR @BaseballAmerica @MLBPipeline But that’s only 2 names said they announced signing 3 kids
@parhamproducti1 Aaron Boone sucks as a coach
@misstaraashley @HotAdultModels The fact that a bully douchebag has u contemplating means he orbshe has already won
@jorgecastillo Always something with these guys - it’s ashame cuz they actually have some talent
@JosinaAnderson Wasn’t misunderstood his reply was thought out and rehearsed don’t recant now or play the misunderstood card own that shit Uncle Sam I mean dak
@JosinaAnderson Ok we’re friends again Brian Reece told me b nice 2 u !
@wesleysnipes @drocktrot Weeeeeeees
@JornielMora_NYC @JesseSanchezMLB @Yankees Just added to mlb list recently &amp; not on baseball America list Im Wondering why maybe he wasn’t eligible to sign and damn 2.5 is a lot for the kid
@Rick12_85 @JesseSanchezMLB Well spending 2.5 on Vargas I imagine not much
@JesseSanchezMLB how’d Kid not on ant top 50 lists get 2.5 million from the Yankees at this late date
@JonathanMayo damn guess my question was answered Alexander Vargas for 2.5 pretty much has to conclude the intl spending wooooow 2.5 was he worth that type money sheesh
@keithlaw damn guess my question was answered Alexander Vargas for 2.5 pretty much has to conclude the intl spending wooooow 2.5 was hecworth that type money
@JesseSanchezMLB @MLBPipeline So I’m assuming that concludes the intl signing for the Yankees 2.5 woooow they must think he’s the damn second coming of Franny Lindor
@JesseSanchezMLB  who has the most intl bonus pool money left to sign Victor 2xs r the Yankees stockpiling money for him or someone else ??
@keithlaw  who has the most intl bonus pool money left to sign Victor 2xs r the Yankees stockpiling money for him or someone else
@jimcallisMLB who has the most intl bonus pool money left to sign Victor 2xs f the Yankees stockpiling money for him or someone else
@victorvmesa @MLBPipeline Yankees new prospect when he’s able to sign
I know it hasn’t been great competition but don’t look now Tanaka looks good os shall I say dominant only 6 runs over last 30 innings @JackCurryYES
Ok @JonathanMayo with Otani slowing to a crawl after the injury whose AL rookie of year I’m going Andujar right now - how bout u ??
@JonathanMayo Agreed woulda traded him instead
Coming along quite nicely https://t.co/sUHmtDJ8sW
All these mofos leaving the AL east they Yankees have no excuse not to run the table -Baltimore &amp; Tampa send everyone away and Toronto sent the Yankees the best piece they possessed - no excuses
@JonathanMayo just heard u on mlb - who do u like more since neither is a specialist and would work both R&amp;LHB Carrol or Kahnle
Kendrick killed it for sure !!!! #power
Don’t let Newcombs1 bitter distract u from the Oralia trade Brad Brach to the Atlanta Braves for 250k Intl bonus money -what r the orioles gonna do with bonus money
@leeeesssi @iamjzapal Stop being messy Bitch and don’t at nobody from my page Jhonni know I’m not talking bout her
Bitch don’t post them old ass pics of me acting like they’re new !!!!!
@Chocola28299621 @MalaysiaPargo That would be amazing hook it up
Follow my IG @richiedollaz
@TommieLHHATL Fuck it just shoot for 💯
Braves need a third basemen and def have the pitching Tx covets - seems like a good deal for Beltre who’d wave his no trade for another playoff run
@JackCurryYES @JesseSanchezMLB Wow 2 Cuban kids Victor victor&amp; Rodriguez  or naw ??
@Feinsand So if that’s the case why not put him on 40 and let someone else go ??? Yankees mustn’t have thought he was the best arm in upper levels - especially with Robertson  about to b a FA
@YankeesPR @Yankees So with the 2 recent trades how much have they accumulated in Intl bonus money
@JonHeyman How much did they get In the first trade ?? 1.1 or am i weonfbon rhat number
@JackCurryYES wasn’t a top 30 guy but was okaying well - I imagine Yanks using  Shreve Kindy for Cuban pitcher Rodriguez - now piling up more intl money for victor Victor who should b eligible soon
If you’ve lost contact w/girls from 10 years ago easiest way to find them ; post a new girl &amp; i guarantee they’ll text  you “ piece of shirt “ , “ really asshole “ , “ fuck u prick “  and u say hey babe I was just looking for you
I wonder if people realize typing long ass  negatively driven message takes more time then swiping left &amp; pushing delete
@Joelsherman1 Prob means they need to sign a couple of players &amp; kahnle is good to go
@BenBadler Finally Shreve gets a fresh start
And with that pitch Dave Robertson has fucked off yet another game - why does it matter what the schedule is if they continue to lose to bad teams anyway -just can’t lose to royals - mets - orioles &amp; rays
@hazelebaby Don’t let that distract u from where u should be 🤷🏾‍♂️😉
@hazelebaby Everywhere but where u should be !!!
@JackCurryYES so the game isn’t on tv ??
@Joelsherman1 They have a great  outfield without Judge the key is finding a DH while Judge is down - lineup length takes a hit now with Sanchize hurt u have a weak 8-9 batter
Just think at this rate the Yankees won’t have to worry bout Judge and his injury or having any pitchers cuz all the games get rained out - now technically u can rest CC this turn thru the rotation- I dunno just an idea !!
@Ken_Rosenthal @DanHayesMLB Can they wait til after the boston series
Dry swings n a week back n action n 3 coulda been worse - yankees dodge bullet w/Judge injury - need Stanton to show up &amp; show but have enough offensive depth to cover even if he doesn’t - Andujar - Didi &amp; Bird hot right hopefully Hicks &amp; walker join the party
@billjamesonline And anyone would care why
@AP I’m guessing zuckerbergis back taking advice from Justin Timberlake instead of Spider-Man
@TampaTarpons Yet Whitlock is back n Tampa why ??
@YankeesPR Don’t really get Boone and the whole bench the player when he’s hot thing - I get days off but  Andujar is 23 &amp; hott pretty hard to justify !!!!  Romine I guess is necessary
@majorrichie11 @RetardoMachado @YankeesPR @swbrailriders When Britton plays a couple games and kahnle presses the issue n Scranton
@DaNickster79 Facts I saw that
Meanwhile poor Tommy Khanle has been banished to Scranton - definition of sugar 2 shit
Severino - Tanaka - CC - Happ &amp; Gray quite frankly not opposed to giving the ball to Gray outside the BX do ya due diligence he’s actually not bad away from home , Cessa - German - Sheffield - Loisigna real losers here
@chadjennings22 Yeah it’s never been the same for him since he splayed for the Indiana pacers lol jk
@yanksguy30 @JackCurryYES Agreed as I’ve said not really an issue with a blocked 3b &amp; a blocked rule 5 OF going to Toronto for a 35 yr old rental that ur not gonna want back it’s the original Drury deal added to this deal now it becomes Solak - widener - mckinney - Drury for Happ no bueno
I have no issues with Drury which should’ve been enough going to Toronto with McKinney a blocked OF , who was rule 5 - my issue lies with getting Drury n first place for widener &amp; solak then sending him off with McKinney for a 35 yr old rental pitcher @JonathanMayo
@BaseballAmerica Good let’s c him n ya top 100 come January
@Nicolem49725364 Baseball ⚾️
@DanCovello @JackCurryYES Doubt that n 18 months machado will be manning third
@JackCurryYES @JonHeyman @Joelsherman1 @Feinsand Wow a lot for a pitcher excuse me rental pitcher with a plus 4 era
@AndrewMarchand
@BNightengale @JonHeyman Im Sure he was being sarcastic I think 🤔
🤔 duno know how I feel bout Happ trade - McKinney rule 5 clears roster space blocked @ MLB level , Drury also blocked with Andujar &amp; Torres gets to go somewhere &amp; play I guess @ second Donaldson prob out after season - could’ve done better then rental pitcher @JackCurryYES
@Fertorr92 @JonHeyman Def just Drury &amp; McKinney no sp
@JonHeyman So Drury &amp; Mckinney for Happ hmmmm don't think I like that for a rental especially since both Drury &amp; McKinney are major league ready
@beeBeKING Never left
@JonHeyman Silly move he isn’t gonna help them anymore then Sheffield would - Drury should hold more value then a rental
@Disney1992World @JasonKime @Feinsand @Joelsherman1 Agreed
@hazelebaby 🤔
@JonathanMayo @MLBPipeline I c u Really like Stephan &amp; Schmidt higher on yankee 30 then my preferred Sauer - Garcia &amp; Whitlock
@JonathanMayo Finally let’s compare and contrast
Yeah went up pitched well don’t understand why he went back down - went 5 no runs but had 5 walks
Morning  tweople
@CNN Truth can never be Defamation my friend
Don’t let all the bs in America distract you from the fact that “ suits “ is back on tonight
@Joelsherman1 As long as none of my top 15 r used I guess it’s fine - don’t really think he’s a difference maker
@rhansonx2 Am I not a big fan ?? Definitely am if he could stay on the field only 25 innings this year stuff is crazy but often hurt needs big second half
Yankee top 10 prospects   1 Sheffield - 2 Florial - 3 loisigna - 4 Abreau - 5 Acevedo - 6 Dgarcia - 7 Medina - 8 Whitlock - 9 sauer 10 F Perez   Outside - Pereira  - Schmidt - Nolan Martinez - Estrada -Adams
@BryanHoch Literally played game 100 today speak to me when 140 is n the books waaaay to early to stress but yes playing better and beating teams u should beat will help the cause
Deivi Garcia my number 9 yankee prospect dealt today n Tampa 6 inning 2 hits 0 walks 12ks 0 runs lowering his era 3.12 in Tampa as a just turned 18 yr old pay attention yankee fans !!!! @JonathanMayo
@MBStadium Roof is crazy but Mercedes can’t keep my 150k gwagon from leaking
Freaking sick !! https://t.co/HHTcro6IBB
Yankees are 6-6 against the Rays this season and 5-5 against the Orioles. The Red Sox are 9-4 vs. the Rays and, entering tonight's game in Baltimore, 10-2 vs. the Orioles.— fucking ridiculous utterly fucking ridiculous 11-11 vs 19-6 hmmm looking for them 6 games look no further
@nellithetiger Hmmm 👌🏾
@Robfeliz Absolutely fucking ridiculous is right
@Matt_Agosta4 Agreed
@DSweetDaddy2348 Facts add orioles to the mix
Shouldn’t be this difficult for the Yankees , quite frankly doesn’t matter how easy the 2nd half schedule is if they can’t beat mediocre teams like the rays &amp; mets
Say what u wanna say Tekashi headed out with Nikki &amp; Future is an amazing look for him !!!!!
With this years gains Touki is prob the best pitching prospect in Brave system - just operating of pure stuff he was that last year - now it’s all coming together !!! @680TheFan
What a wasted year for Gary Sanchez literally was terrible when on the field and now hurt til August - smh wasted year
Coming back from break splitting with mets and losing series to Rays is disgusting - like seriously disgusting 2 Innings to figure this shit out
@careym74 So I’m guessing DL for a month isntonorotext his feeling ummm yeah u make alotta sense
@MiLB @ToukiToussaint @GoStripers @Braves @mlbbowman I’ve said all along touki was the one gonna be an ace !!
If they can’t beat the rays w/o machado they have bigger problems my friend much bigger problems
@Feinsand Why do they keep mentioning Adams he’s not an option barely still n triple a rotation he sucks and sucked again today
Can’t be serious the Yankees can’t be serious down to Tampa - like seriously wake the fuck Up and handle ya biz
No Hicks again must be a lil banged up @JackCurryYES
@680TheFan They had the prospects can’t imagine that deal not getting done if they wanted him at all
@shevyclassick I’d be very surprised by that fake move
So Sanchize gets killed for not hustling ends up being hurt again - my bad Gary but u still cost yankees a game yesterday bro
@680TheFan Needed a sweep
@CNN Man stfu like seriously how much more can we take
@Chellev311 🤔
@Chellev311 @Pinky808 😉
@drocktrot Dirt bag move 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
@Buster_ESPN Ima Sanchize Stan but can’t condone nor accept that definitely cost yankees that game - very selfish play , you’d think the way everyone else plays is contagious literally the only guy that doesn’t play the right way is him as evidenced by Hicks even making them go to 1st
@Buster_ESPN Disgusting
@BNightengale He needs to sit down for a while Girardi doesn’t look so crazy now does he and I’m the biggest Sanchize fan out here but tonight was unacceptable
If u can’t run or don’t wanna run don’t fucking play everyone knows I’m a Sanchize fan but common man seriously u can’t hurt the team like this - Hicks did all he could and u couldn’t even run the damn play out - not acceptable bro
@JackCurryYES never liked giving up the out on sac bunts puts added  pressure on next batter
How was L&amp;HH hollywood tonight ?? WTvhing yankee game &amp; brave game so I missed it or did I miss anything ??
A teams ace goes down right before the game so they bullpen it yet Severino looks like he should be the one sitting this one out - disappointment personified offense gotta come thru cuz Severino doesn’t have it at all
@KingZito973 Facts immediately just nothing out there worth giving up the farm for - prefer give Sheffield Acevedo and Loisigna when healthy them innings
All of a sudden Gincarlo Stanton is batting 283 with a 870 ops - I’d say that’s more like it
@JonHeyman What they got for a return ??
Blame that hanger on Sanchize 2 right
This can’t happen bro just can’t happen a loss to Tampa just can’t happen not here &amp; now like seriously Boston is legit running away with the division like 🏃🏾‍♀️ 🏃🏾
MIL- ATL- ARI- COL-PIT-STL- SF- WSH all within 5 games of Natl league WC - Braves need to win the division !!!
Ok now Severino is dealing changeup now slider
Braves need a sweep 2 outta 3 won’t do it  vs the marlins need all 3 while Nats got brewers &amp; Philly got La
Braves look good tonight gone be interesting seeing how they play this trade deadline  - this season reminds me of last seasons yankees - ahead of schedule do they mortgage the farm or stand pat with prospects
@MarcCarig Def didn’t have good stuff took 8 pitches and couldnt put away one batter and threw 24 in the inning
@thegooglefact As If I needed another reason to indulge the Golden Arches
Yankees won’t trade Acevedo - Frazier - Florial - Abreau or Sheffield for a rental at trade deadline !!! I’d add Loisigna - Medina - Whitlock - Sauer - D Garcia 2 that list - #norentals
Can’t stop won’t stop !!!! https://t.co/8k87I8iHUs
@680TheFan No they should use some of the elite pitching prospects on the farm as relievers
To Iranian President Rouhani: I AM UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OBSTRUCTION &amp; TREASON. I JUST MET WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT &amp; ATTACKED MY OWN GOVERNMENT WHILE SUPPORTING HIS. THEN I INVITED HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I NEED TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THAT SO I AM THREATENING YOU INSTEAD.
Wanna know why trump is president look no further then milwaukee Wisconsin baseball field Saturday night !!!! The base let’s u know how they felt - come to grips tweople America is racist
@Monae_inkz Yeah she fucked that up majorly
Yankees only place 1 player on prospectus &amp; Laws top 50 midseason lists Sheffield 40 &amp; 12 respectively - can’t disagree with the injuries but guessing Loisigna - Abreau , Perez &amp; Florial will find ways into bottom half
If you think Golf  isn’t a completely different sport with Tiger Woods healthy &amp; playing well you’re crazy !!!!!!
@tariqnasheed @colbycolb I’m blaming anyone of color that didn’t hold him accountable in the clubhouse period Lorenzo Cain we looking at u bro ...
Hader gets standing ovation for being a racist homophob in milwaukee guess that explains trump winning Wisconsin- kap can’t get a job in queens ny tho
Be a racist homophob get exposed for such say u sorry play the kid roll get standing ovation you da man now bro next step galvanize the base become president @keithlaw
@TommieLHHATL 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️👎🏽🤚🏾🙏🏽
Painting this scenario 4 @JackCurryYES Sheffield is lights out tonight - Cessa doesn’t pitch well but Yankees still win a shoot out - German remains n Scranton - next turn thru barring a trade for a pitcher I think it’s time to c what Sheffield has !!!
Gray pitches well no need for the Acevedo piggy back now Cessa comes up for Germans next turn in rotation and Acevedo goes back down to continue his madness n Trenton next week !!!!
Looking for hott music - send tracks &amp; full songs 2  - djrovedu@gmail.com hott stuff only please keep the bs !!!
Wanna hear me talk Braves - Hawks - Falcons - sec 🏈 we’ll get ready I’ll be on @680TheFan with a podcast as well coming soon !!!!
Yankees have 26 hits n the last 2 games yet a -1 run differential clutch hitting &amp; pitching has to be better then this !!!!!
@Ken_Rosenthal Ok is this money for next season or this one cuz I feel like everyone except Victor victor is signed already
@iam_dasirablack Lemme know when ur n atlanta !!
Shreve closes the game how bout that !!!!! Save #1
@Joelsherman1 A lil late for intl National money isn’t it - everyone of note is signed except maybe victor victor I imagine that’s the goal
Chapman really man wtf was that ??
Yankees or braves need international slot money I hear victor victor told me he’ll be eligible for signing n next couple weeks
Just so u know it is 93 with a real feel of 104 in Miami today - just saying
Regardless of the outcome Sonny Gray pitched well today and I’ll take that outting every time minus Dave Robertson shenanigans
If Sonny Gray would stop thinking on the mound so much he’d have better results - one thing to be cerebral yet another to be obsessive -I’d take today’s start every day of the week 5.1/3 - 1 run works for me left leading 4-1 !!!!
@TampaTarpons @TorresGleyber Why did Whitlock go back down had a good start n Trenton - help me understand that move
@lilu_moon @HotAdultModels 🤚🏾
@nyknicks @NJHoopRecruit Wonder if he was throwing nutcrackers @ safaree last week
Preface by saying , I’m a big German fan wanna see him succeed even Said I thought his stuff was better then Montgomerys but until Loisigna gets back which will prob be never I think Cessa is earning a 👀 ... he couldn’t be much worse
@MiLB Let’s not forget his 9+ era
I know everyone loves Louis  Medina but a 9era in Pulaski isn’t acceptable I don’t care how good they say his stuff obviously it isn’t translating he’s getting hit and has no control what so ever at that stage he should be dominating with 1 pitch @JonathanMayo
Where is Johnny Loisigna when u need him ??
Gonna be a long weekend in the Bronx and Boone is to blame - why would u start the back end of the rotation out the break I understand if you’re 4.5 up but not down all these games are premium especially against the mets big boys Friday &amp; Sunday
If the Yankees fall a few more games behind boston the WC will be the fate and no trades should be made this year for these bs players out here - nobody on the market is good enough to help the Yankees go to next level @AndrewMarchand
Meanwhile somewhere n the motor city Boston is prob  gonna pummel the 🐅 !!!
Didn’t  agree with the Yankees rotation out the gate when a strong start was essential why the hell we rocking with German &amp; Gray n first games back why @JackCurryYES why
Didn’t  agree with the Yankees rotation out the gate when a strong start was essential why the hell we rocking with German &amp; Gray n first games back
Smh here we go starting the second half with the same bullshit from German - if he can’t get it too fucking gether get his ass out the rotation &amp; I was an advocate for him over Montgomery from the door   4.5 down no room for bullshit
@bethanyxxxbenz I’m here
@680TheFan Austin Riley ready by mid August/  sept call up unless he falters n 3A , don’t expect maybe he’s the answer !!?? we’ll c bout Alex Jackson just getting to 3A so questions have to be answered !!!
@680TheFan Braves need a beast 3b &amp; a start catcher that lineup is killa hold up Swanson better figure it out soon
@DritaDavanzo @drocktrot And you retweeted  this why ??
@nytimes Sweet add this to the millions of things that anyone else but trump would be criticized /crucified for but his base doesn’t seem to care
@JonHeyman @Fancred Always been baseball brilliant it’s the billy Martin isn’t him that’s the problem
@jjcoop36 He signed with Alabama already ??
@slutsaucekhloe Let’s c Pics sharing is caring
@JonathanMayo when do u guys update ya top 💯 &amp; top 30 team list
Clint Frazier was taken out the game &amp; triple A Scranton today after 1 AB - maybe an injury maybe traded waiting on details🤔@swbrailriders
@keithlaw with only Sheffield @ 12 on midseason top 50 were any other Yankees in consideration .. I know You liked Perez , Abreau &amp; Florial in the top 💯 any other Yankee kids creeping up - Medina - Acevedo - Whitlock - Sauer - D Garcia - Duran - Periera
@BleacherReport @wojespn As well he should not what you’re worth but what u negotiate , Football dudes gotta hate guaranteed contracts plus he goes to houston for vet minimum &amp; adds another 5 to that 28
@WFAN660 so Mello to the A i like that move removes alotta pressure from Collins &amp; Young - they shouldn’t waive him actually think he’d be invigorated and have a decent year n the weak east
@TommieLHHATL @tommieelee007 This pic right here tho ,definitely the money shot !!!!!!
@keithlaw do U do a mid season prospect top 100 ??
So trump got America out here looking crazy , weak and hypocritical !!! Dude picks fights , loud talks everyone but Putin ... if you’re the park bully but refuse to beef with the one kid in the sand box ,either you’re scared of him or you know he knows ya weakness ! Period
@hitmansteviej congrats my brotha congrats - happiness is everything right now !!!!
Not really understanding the Derozen for Leonard trade at all a does it make either team that much better &amp; he isn’t staying In Toronto didn’t even wanna go in the first place so it’s a rental that still doesn’t make u better then boston or Phil I dunno y’all tell me
@_crymearivera I feel like josh hader
The Josh Hader kid cant justify those tweets period -I don’t care if it’s 7–10-15 yrs  ago
@r_jessenia Damn You found a tweet from 13
@JonathanMayo so Garett Whitlock got promoted to Trenton a couple of good outings  n 2A &amp; he will have to enter that top 100 conversation with Deivi Garcia !!!
@jimcallisMLB so Garett Whitlock got promoted to double A a couple of good outings there he will have to enter that top 100 conversation with Deivi Garcia !!!
@altamuramarc @JackCurryYES I’m not so sure Anaheim is selling r u - trout free agency coming up fast is that the message you’re sending to the best player n baseball
@Nikki_Irish @slutsaucekhloe Damn I’m sorry won’t happen again
Yankees aren’t in the A all season
@S_Beasley @680TheFan Braves r this years yankees now do u go all in this year - best farm n the game would possibly no definitely net u Machado if so desired - NL is weak is this the year to load up ???
@680TheFan Big series for the braves coming back I expect the Nats to make a second half run &amp; I also believe the NL east will be easier to win then the WC with 5 teams within 5 games of both slots - Philly with the .5 game lead is where Braves eyes need to be set !!!!!
@Joelsherman1 He deserves a job for sure - binder joe is back
Disappointed in Yankees thought the desire to close first half strong would’ve been greater - Bmore series as well as this clev series leaves a lot to be desired and going into the break down 5 3 n loss to Boston isn’t cool at all !!!!!
@RyanEvans29 @JackCurryYES Very that’s key #1 winning the games they’re supposed to because ur right clearly 5-5 against a team 40 under 500 unacceptable
@altamuramarc @JackCurryYES That’s not a key when the starters on the market suck
@680TheFan Dealin
@TommieLHHATL I mean if u lookin in the circus Dont get mad when u find clowns
@TommieLHHATL Naw I still follow u
@BryanHoch @RailRidersTT Lol classic
Yankee keys for second half @JackCurryYES   1 -beat the teams they’re supposed too much easier second half schedule take advantage   2 -Tanaka must be Tanaka whoever that Tanaka is   3 -Sanchize / Bird come alive   4 - id like to say Gray figure it out but think that’s a wrap
@RailRidersTT @BryanHoch Even tho he’s still pre arb is he still responsible for the fancy spread - steak lobster &amp; such ??
@FunkyFreshEzE @MaxWildstein Eye test says he make routine plays but as much as I like Miguel’s bat he’s a staue at third no doubt
@680TheFan How the Braves close the first half should determine if they should buy sell or just wait til free agency - they def have some money to spend so next season could be a big one of some prospects step forward hey Touki
@680TheFan Tough one always loved him since he was n yankee system years back
All of me says Manny makes that play but it was a tough one more about footwork then the actual throw - thinking he may have been safe anyway but if he doesn’t sit back on hop innings over machado charges that ball @JackCurryYES
@FunkyFreshEzE @MaxWildstein All of me says he does even tho we could be wrong that was a tough one more about footwork then the actual throw - thinking he may have been safe anyway but if he doesn’t sit back on hop innings over machado charges that ball
@680TheFan let’s congratulate my guy Touki on being selected to Futures Game - might have be having the best season of any of the Atl pitching prospects in minors - seems to have figured it out
@MLBPipeline @SIRIUSXM @AllStarGame @_YoSoy_Touki @Braves @mlbbowman @GoStripers @mbraves @FireFrogsBB @TheRomeBraves @DanvilleBraves Touki has had a breakout year might b the best prospect stuff wise in minors for Atl
So Tyler Clippard is gonna haunt the Yankees until he no longer does - I can c this will be problematic
@Feinsand Reminiscent of his yankee career
I still have faith in Serena don’t @ me til it’s over !!!   Thanks
I got Serena for the win !!!
100+ criminal counts 35 total indictments 32 people indicted 3 companies indicted 5 guilty pleas Paul Manafort in jail Michael Flynn guilty Trump told Russia to hack Trump staff met with Russians Trump Jr. worked w/Wikileaks  This is not a witch hunt. It’s a criminal conspiracy.
@680TheFan All depends if they think this is the year if not keep the prospects and try in free agency - all about being self aware are they better then the Nats - diamondbacks- dodgers - cubs - brewers - and even Phillies for that matter
@JackCurryYES Damn the all star game who cares but now that we all realize he sucks im guessing we can take him off the Yankee wish list
@BryanHoch Couple that with his record and I’ll  take that everyday of the week and twice on Sundays
Todays new 12 Russian indicted for interfering with US Elections , Trump not wanted in England and is about to be in deep shit here in America makes Monday’s sumsmit very interesting
@JoeBudden Stop it joe
@mlbtraderumors Well apparently he doesn’t wanna be traded lol
@680TheFan No Freddie noooooo
@slutsaucekhloe Your welcome at least day my name
Trump said again this morning that the U.S. has been paying "probably 90% of the cost of NATO." The U.S. has been paying 22% of actual NATO costs, spending 72% of the total defence spending of the alliance. Guess it kinda like his inauguration crowd !!!

@swbrailriders @_tylerwade Not former he’ll b back next week after the all star break
@JonHeyman @Fancred Hope someone else gets him y@ankees keep prospects and get him next year in FA
@BryanHoch I imagine it’s everyone else that’s the problem
Damn I messed up SAUER goes in 8 push everyone back one
Yankees top 10 prospect asterisk for top 💯 - all subjective my list   1 Sheffield * 2 Florial * 3 Loisigna * 4 Abreau * 5 Acevedo  6  Medina  7 Whitlock  8 Tate  9 Garcia  10 Carrol    Maybe slide Schmidt n if u like starter over reliever that is Carrol  Adams out * was top 100
Ohh by the way minus last nights Bill Buckner move that cost them the Game Greg Bird looks pretty damn good recently !!!!
Dude @ the beach out me on his ig live told me talk to the people I look at viewers and it was 3 !!! Common broski
@JonathanMayo 16 total games between  low &amp; high A -1.13 &amp; 1.90 era respectively 97ks 20w in 87 innings &amp; a whip below 1 kids looking pretty good damn 22 yr old Garret Whitlock !!!!
Last couple days and few games the yankees have killed themselves - splitting with bmore is sooo Unacceptable and even worse losing 3 of 4 they should be calling for heads - they’ve been playing to level of company all year now 3.5 our 2 n loss is no good place
@pinstripealley No stay with the infield we have. Ow evaluate at the seas know end of u wanna get Manny it’ll cost money no players -get a damn pitcher now that’s what they need not a 3b or SS
Have you Ever noticed someone going hard on ig live or snap then realize they are literally talking to 2 people ?? I mean pick up the phone that’s a three way call bro
@MissEMILYs @loveandhiphopat Naw love I’m good
@coachCCB @hitmansteviej Facts
@sistersinpower1 Falcons of course
@towazy @YankeesWFAN @Yankees My take is unsound absolutely ridiculous and maybe should refrain from making a fool of yaself 2 Game lead with over 75 to play ur silly
@UberFacts Now it’s free to bita a kid riding his bike &amp; die
@Robfeliz He’s actually a terrible manager but very likable and good with media and most importantly hard to complain when u have third best record n game - but yes his decisions suck starting with what u pointed out
@Robfeliz Well when u lose to bmore does it really mattter seems like yankees get lax vs bad team shoulda swept Toronto and should b sweeping bmore instead we hop for 3 outta 4
@Fyocca123 Exactly
Meathead telling it like it is https://t.co/aH0jyEftFQ
2 people that r winning 1 drake 2 Aubrey
Folks blaming Democrats, it’s wise to remember that they are not the ones who held up Merrick Garland. If you want Democrats to exert power, they need to have it first. So ultimately, this is on the voters for being complacent. Self reflect !!
U better pay attention a Game is a Game and boston is winning of course u feel it now they are 2.5 Games back and could picked up a half game clearly u don’t know baseball
That really hurt the Yankees not a good look losing to bmore today now game 2 a must win with Cessa going
@BryanHoch This loss will hurt more then most - they need a big 9th inning
This loss will really hurt the Yankees definitely a game they should’ve won - bad coaching by Boone yet again but it shouldn’t b close either SMH
Another day another bad coaching decision from Boone he’s made many  - yankees will prob / hopefully win and it’ll b forgotten but in the playoffs al these moves will b under microscope and I don’t count WC as playoffs
@careym74 Wrong nobody cares bout scouts when ur 2 down n division race as evidenced By the score all games count right now
Split would b disgusting today need both pick up a half n standing and 1 n loss column
Why would I think yh3 yankees could money into b,ore and grab 2 real quick - un fucking real
@BryanHoch &amp; wtf does that mean - I used to feel great bout trigonometry doesn’t meAn I did well
@BryanHoch Dunno what the hell that means - this is a NY team please use our jargon or coach the As - dodgers or angels
@careym74 Teams Don’t cost themselves games trying to showcase talent !!!
Let’s play 2 !!! Yankees vs Orioles
Early yankee game thank for for MLB network !!
So he yankees decided to roll out the whole Scranton lineup in game 1 today ?? Wtf is this Drury - Wade - Walker -Higgy &amp; Frazier
@wheelan_matthew @jcrasnick At least SS is hella deep
@JonesTadpole @mdjaxon @jcrasnick Def doesn’t
@680TheFan This years Braves = last years yankees , now what do they do to improve the big club with 8  top 💯 prospects they gotta sell the right talent off !!!!

@jessikittyy @slutsaucekhloe Exactly it’s free - would u pay for a driver if Uber was free
@BryanHoch Over who that’s bullshit - he didn’t last 3 innings ,even Loisigna 5 innings 3 is better - Tanaka is back so that’s bullshit
Nah bro I wish tho
Man wtf is Stanton doing just killed the inning chasing shit fucking gave away a crucial AB
So now “booed up “ has turned into the for the pussy challenge ??
Clint Frazier is waaaay to good for triple A - he needs big league at bats , nothing left to prove in Scranton !!!! Buuuuut yankees r stacked @ OF &amp; DH

Kyrie &amp; jimmy Butler the back court in NY season after this one !!!! Ya starting five 19/20 season   1 Irvin  2 butler  3 Knox  4 Porzingis  5 Mitch Robinson
Loisigna being sent down is a Strategic move get another bullpen guy in and can still use him this weekend vs Baltimore called up as 26th guy I imagine prob won’t even leave town
@YankeesPR @swbrailriders Well that’s a promotion from double A he can get some more inning , learn how to finish batters off , fine tune some things , get on innings limit and come back strong if needed !!
@TommieLHHATL @tommieelee007 U not playing fair tommie
@Msberrybliss Indeed
@AndrewMarchand Did u just miss the part where golden state signed boogie cousins La not coming out the west much less with a chip
@ken_dolllllllll Necessary !!!

@TheyLoVeRi16 I live n the A where u been besides if u think I did scenes  for free u crazy ohh and third if ya boss calls u and tells u u can grab some OT I ain’t doing shit what u gonna do

And it has nothing to do with Trey young stinking it up tonight in summer league, I’ve Said that from the beginning
Mark my words save this tweet favorite it do all that Hawks will regret letting Doncik go for Young - watch what I tell ya
@MixMamba34 @Lakers @kawhileonard Ball I think is definitely a gonner
@MixMamba34 @Lakers @kawhileonard Hell no they r destroying the Lebron signing having Ball - Rondo - Stephenson &amp; lebron all on same team makes no sense they all need the ball 🏀
Johnny ⚾️ has to figure out how to close the deal - the 2 strike contact is ridiculous kids never gonna go more then 5 innings like seriously next step is going further and putting hitters away quicker !!!
Next up for the Lakers signing Mello after OKC buys him out !!!
@billboard Damn prob got a new wrangler to boot
@PeezystayNorfin U sound nuts nobody y’all brought n plays good D and  Randall was a young cornerstone to build on if healthy - construction of this team seems very weird a bunch of people that need the 🏀 n hand
How’s that for manufacturing a run 🏃🏾 #yankees !!!
: @Drake 725-775k SPS (150-160k pure woooow world wide def over a million first week - streaming has changed the game for sure
@680TheFan Love watching the braves young team they are last years yankees - young and ahead of schedule
@PeezystayNorfin Lance - Rondo or ball play good D and u just Randall leave for New Orleans whats ya point with that tweet
Johnny Lasaigna aka Johnny ⚾️ on the mound tonight !!!!!
confused what the Lakers r doing they have 3 people that have to have the 🏀 n hand - Rondo can’t shoot can’t play off the ball - Lance can’t create from wing he creates from straight on &amp; lebron is point fwd that doesn’t include Lonzo another can’t shoot ball n hand creator
On another note is watching Cole Hamels throw clunkers &amp; Fuller not really being good as first thought , he’s def not 2 n the Yankee rotation ...  Is Happ now the best option ? @JonHeyman
How many of them vs how many of us , nobody really knows cuz some them are hiding in the weeds but guess we’ll see next Election Day !!!
with every passing day Trump galvanizes his base with the things he’s doing ..  The Supreme Court nominee being a kkk advocate just speaks to his disrespect for the country as well as his desire 2 rile up his base .. sad thing is it’s working like a charm !!!!

@CeoFrizz Yeah we did his name is sonny gray
@RealSkipBayless Enough bro I gotta unfollow u the shit u text is so ridiculous
All U yankee haters keep the same energy with all the articles and blogs about how boston is n trouble etc etc
@Ken_Rosenthal He sucks then end !!
The Yankees win 8-1 it’s nothing Yankees lose 11-0 it’s a sign of the times , playoff statement ... fuck outta here they got butts kicked by Sale correct but if u think sonny gray sees a playoff start you’re crazy
@IAM_GITO Facts
If Jorge Mateo didn’t suck , Fowler had absolutely no where to play on this team @ KAP  Seems like he may never freaking start a game I’d be livid about the sonny Gray trade
Sonny Gray is the pitcher the other teams get Happy when they’re facing all wondering how high can I get my avaerage during this game
I said it on Tuesday and I stand by it why would u alter rotation and keep Gray pitching on Saturday night nationally televised game against the Red Sox should flipped CC let the kids pitch Saturday &amp; Sunday
I got one for u @JackCurryYES when Tanaka is healthy let’s keep Loisigna &amp; German in rotation &amp; let Gray figure it out !!!
Sonny Gray will fuck up a Saturday evening quick , fast and in a hurry - guess I’ll go to the movies and wait for Severino tomorrow !!!!!
@CeoFrizz Smh guess that was a pipe dream
Woooow grand slam n the first inning against Sonny Gray &amp; I’m sure Chris Sale is like yup this ones over already !!! Sonny Gray sucks seriously sucks
@CeoFrizz Yeah we do but I’m not betting on it
@JudgeGregMathis Juuudge what up my brotha
@TommieLHHATL Stop being cheap Tommie !!

@keithlaw I get it that but n This day and age everyone knows the outcome they have enough data, common Keith I’m not even a pitcher and I’ve heard Al Leiter tell his story 100xs not to mention all the other cautionary tales of being overworked these kids need to be protected
@keithlaw Why don’t college pitchers take themselves out ?? why allow a coach who gives a shit less bout ya future to run u n the ground ??
@lilsugarhips Ummmm hmmmmm

@MLBPipeline @swbrailriders @Yankees @Topsheff42 @BryanHoch @TrentonThunder @ChasRiverDogs @SIYanks @PulaskiYanks For bringing Sheffield in n relie
@MLBPipeline @swbrailriders @Yankees @Topsheff42 @BryanHoch @TrentonThunder @ChasRiverDogs @SIYanks @PulaskiYanks What was rational for that - been wondering all day
@BryanHoch That was never n question the question is and will be how will price get out of pitching Sunday night
@stuntinonem83 @TrapMilan @sameolhim FYI I live n atlanta
I guess this is the Yankees saying that Tanaka is ready for a quick simulated game / rehab start &amp; will be back + Loisigna stays n the rotation @JackCurryYES
“ Booed Up “ is  so Keyshia Cole 2009 - good R&amp;B joint

@mlananna @BaseballAmerica Someone will try and sneak him n guaranteed !!
@Passion__love Always has been I’ve been here for years Decatur where it’s greater
@JonathanMayo why is avelino still in double A with Thairo hurt shouldn’t he have been promoted Wade -Drury - avelino &amp; Torreyes moving around the♦️with Wade &amp; Torreyes also getting reps n the OF
@AndrewMarchand He has no hitters under his belt and a wealth of baseball knowledge - if he says it probably was warranted
@JonHeyman Get familiar he’s a beast !!
Damn yes this is kinda deep !!! https://t.co/eIQyxEicQE
@jimcallisMLB so I’m wondering why Johnny Loisigna isn’t in the top 100 ?? By the time y’all put him in he would’ve graduated !! #Johnnybaseball
Welcome back @JackCurryYES  hope u enjoyed the wifes weekend now down to the nitty gritty of the post game !!!!
@OfficialDouvo Let’s do it
Speaking of Atlanta u can catch me on the fan very soon talking atlanta sports ⚾️,🏀, 🏈 should be fun tune in https://t.co/ychTuh3WSZ
I’m here and never leaving welcome me to the A full time !!!!!
@AkaLanceVance No bitch but the check is
Meek has come full circle comeback complete !!!!!
@TBT_Ent Horrible analogy and the league he played in was the top euro league def no slouches and he won mvp but yes time will tell
@KanoPowPow I hope so but like the “ scout “ said beware you’re not getting Eddie house instead of Steph curry
@DaveLeeC3 And Doncik is that just taller, better and can shoot it
@TBT_Ent He’s a 6’8 19 yr old Point guard with vision , instincts &amp; can shoot it and at 6’8 with another inch or 2 u don’t need to b supremely athletic - he’s a game changer
@Fresko024 2-3 days a week
@ant_mosley Damn hotel police
@DWHomeCandles Live these
Atlanta hawks gave up Donsic for Young that’s gonna be a bad move moving forward - actually a horrible move
@lazofficial Lol ohhh my bad , I misread the post 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ Laz whaaaat Up !!!!
@WOWFactsOfLife @lazofficial Wtf kinda exes u had usually takes me 1 , 2 tops trips to the club and I’m good
@Austinromine7 - Austin Romine keep the same energy now your a starter so don’t complain &amp; produce let’s c u get exposed u fucking bum never have u had starter skills you’re lucky you’re a back up - produce now here is ya chance
@BrendanKutyNJ Let’s start with at what time is Shreve gonna be DFAed hopefully before the flight back north
Lol fucking  yankees get swept by the rays inexcusable like seriously inexcusable!!!
I imagine that’s the last we will see of Chasen Shreve I hate they lost but if that’s what it took for them to DFA him &amp; call up Carroll I’m cool with it !!! 🤷🏾‍♂️✌🏾✌🏾🖕🏾
Miguel Andujar has a lot of Adrian Beltre mannerisms in him - I wonder if You asked who his favorite player was what he would say??
@TheGreatWhite Yeah really it is and the rules are more of a joke - wonder if Frazier leaves the yard on that one ??
Now with Romine talking that shit bout being a back up catcher let’s c what he does or doesn’t do with his shot - I expect Sanchize to be out for a while at least a week if in fact that was his groin ...
Prediction German has 2 more starts before Tanaka comes back if he looks like this &amp; Loisigna looks half way decent he’s outta there Johnny will continue to gets starts
@TheGreatWhite Please already man wtf was he looking at the last 2 pitches were supposed to be smoked somewhere
If u think in a 162 game season your team isn’t gonna lose some they were supposed to win then you’re insane !!! As annoying as it may be it happens 2 everyone , it’s not news !
@swbrailriders Well he has no options so being sent down won’t b that easy but we can def cut him
I knoooooow Austin Romine isn’t hinting he’s unhappy with being the back up catcher - no way no how , he almost been out the league and now he’s beefing bout being the back up to Sanchize - I blame trump for this @AndrewMarchand
Pure love is giving w/o the thought of getting anything in return !!
I’m fixing MLB playoff system right now top 5 in order of wins &amp; losses division winners are cool but playoffs via wins and losses
@Gray1Lala Scrappy back n the A but Richie D might be on ya tv screen
Just an FYI if the Yankees play roughly 500 ball the rest of the way they’d still win 95 games &amp; did I mention the second half they have the third weakest schedule in MLB !!?? Just saying
Finally got this sucker to come visit me - now he doesn’t wanna leave https://t.co/hfyXyapvkk
@CEO_RaNGE On point I agree
@CEO_RaNGE Facts
Why girls get “ hair did” here n Miami is beyond me - humidity is the crazy money waster !!
I’m all for patience &amp; if the Yankees continue to win I imagine I understand the rational with Greg Bird but common man something has to be done he literally sucks right now - starting to think imhea just not the answer
@iamKingLos what up my G I’m waiting on the heat !!
Green  - Betances - Chapman &amp; Holder I can do w/o Warren , Shreve the new Robertson &amp; Cessa   Yankee bullpen this year
Yankees hit Amir of homers but they aren’t incapable of building runs Gardner - Judge high ob guy , Stanton supposed to be high ob guy - Sanchize pure hitter tho very slow - Hicks high ob guy with lots of speed , Torres, Andujar , Didi all contact guys with vg athleticism
@Joelsherman1 Lost ya damn mind don’t be  disrespectful !!!!
Lemme find out tuberculosis meds “ Bgc “ cures type 1 diabetes !!!
@daze11 Damn really I thought 6’6 damn now I really love the pic
Doncik 6’6 pg with handles , Iq &amp; can score maybe not as loud or hyperbolic but def a cornerstone building block - I’m going with the European everyday twice on Sunday
So not only are the kids being separated from parents but they’re also being taken out of the states parents are in -how do u plan to reunite or do u ???
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @CLewandowski_ Damn I wanna hear the rest of this the end was the best , where’s the rest of the sound bite
Ok I’m done I’ll do my draft analysis in my head alone - catch me on the fan Atlanta very soon talking  🏈 ,⚾️ 🏀
I woulda took porter way too much upside to pass up plus he’s gonna have a chip on shoulder if he was able to come out last year he woulda been top 5
Wooooooow Kevin Knox these guys never cease to amaze lol but u know what I’m not mad 6’9 can shoot it , handle it and will b the new 3 man like fizdale Said position less basketball he’s a 3-4
now Knick have a decision .. do u swing for fences with porter or go solid with  bridges
Cavs fooled everyone well at least me thought the6 were picking Porter- he a superb athlete Daron Fox / John wall type n transition he gonna run it down ya throat amazing athlete when he extends j to 3 gonna be a beast -
Bamba from Texas goes 2 Orlando front court is good &amp; young he’s a gonna solidify the paint athletic and long as hell D is gone be crazy run ,jump , block and rebound the ball wont need shots at all will get his off the glass
So what now Schroeder is a goner or what both small can’t play togethers would be a defensible liability !!!
DALLAS drafts Trey Young I think everyone knows what he can do with the ball score from anywhere , pass his butt off  kinda small &amp; not crazy athletic so d will be the question but he can handle the pill , dish &amp; score with the best
J Jackson Mich state gonna be high energy can shoot the ball very athletic lotta rebounds &amp; great D with average scoring
Doncik goes to DALLAS via Atl with the 3rd pick - played n Europe won the chip - offensively gonna be good 6’6 plays the 1 only 19 yrs old can shoot, handle &amp; pass high IQ - gonna be r rally good let’s how he plays d tho no overly athletic but man a 6’6 point that can score
Bagley good offensive choice no d yet but him with Fox will be a nice 1-2
Phoenix takes Ayton I like it big ,strong ,good footwork and can shoot it a lil bit from 15-20 A+ pick - he can’t be lazy n the league and that’s a good thing for him !!!
First day of summer , Enjoy it people !!!
Don’t look now the Yankees have a 2 game lead and 4 in the loss !!!!
Stantooooon !!!!!!
At least commentators r finally calling out Boone for his bad bullpen management - ridiculous to bring shreve n that situation just plain stupid now instead of 3-3 it’s 5-3
Hope Drury is playing first cuz Bird isn’t it !!!
So they brought fanny pacs back specifically to cover the box while wearing leggings / joggers / spandex now a ninja just gotta b disrespectful and stare
@TommieLHHATL Don’t set ya followers up the Nigga just might b like ✌🏾
So I guess the Yankees r conceding this game by leaving Shreve in
How the hell Is  Shreve sitting on a 4.5 era &amp; get the call in that situation bad call by Boone shoulda let the kid get out the inning - i repeat a 4.5 doesn’t warrant much confidence actually Boone make a lot of bad calls
Looking at the boxscore they have the Mariner run charged to Johnny ⚾️ , hows that possible when he scored on a throwing error E4 @AndrewMarchand
@AndrewMarchand Naw he was gone regardless nobody liked him , like seriously he was one Game from the pennant if that didn’t save his gig it wasn’t saveable
@JoyAnnReid Criticism from some but I’m sure people are home like “ yes we are taking America back “ just a matter of how many of each
@TommieLHHATL 🤚
I’ve said since last year that Monty stuff is nowhere near as good as Germans &amp; now he’s showing it yet the Yankees are still acting like they don’t know what role he plays - he isn’t Chad Green he has 3 pitches.. he’s a starter !!  @JackCurryYES please help me understand
This world is so fucked up right now !!!!
@rileyreidx3 False advertising we all know you’re not doing that but it sounds good I guess
@Moosh0611 @JackCurryYES No
@BestRealityBlog Interesting
Yankee all stars only Judge is winning fan vote but overall should be Judge  - Sanchez - Severino - Chapman &amp; Betances &amp; maybe Torres !!
@BestRealityBlog 👀 who told U that ??
JZ &amp; Beyoncé album did these numbers below and these number aren’t including Tidal which had the project for a day and a half before other streaming sites I-guesstimate another 25-50k worth of streaming &amp; pure     115,000-125,000 [Sales Plus Streams] 72,000-77,000 [Pure Sales
@Joelsherman1 Gotta make the right moves and not send off the right players I prefer to hoard them all
@BryanHoch @MLBNetwork Where is Eziquiel Duran and why isn’t he n Charleston
Is Dellin Betances an all-star ?? @JackCurryYES
The energy you put into this world will always come back to you when you least expect it.
“Over here we measure success by the success of those with us - u broke if everybody around u broke but u “ !!! JZ
Motherfuckas post moments talking about this is a private moment between our family , we are very private it’s nobodies biz what we do but yet the shits on the gram - this shit has always confused me
@QueezyDaChamp Yes sir u 2 Cuzo
@chrishaunaxx How u try either u do or U don’t !!
Happy Father’s Day 2 all the dads !!!!
@MeMpHiTz Dude I thought we was fin to get it poppin out here

Phone ain’t rang in so long I had to call myself 🤷🏽‍♂️
@TommieLHHATL ohhhhhh tommmiiiieeeeee
Has Beyoncé made y’all forget  Nas dropped a project produced by Kanye ??
@slutsaucekhloe I dunno wait a few years it’ll b obvious
@mamajeweldollaz None of them not them but specifically these https://t.co/q642pbd8oT
Work hard play harder https://t.co/Iry9a6v5Fm
If I ever c another pair of them ugly ass balenciaga shoes it’ll be a day 2 soon !!!
@JudgeGregMathis Judge what’s up my brotha !!
@JackCurryYES  looks like if Betances keeps up this pace he could be going to another all star game that would give the Yankees 3 pitchers &amp; 3 position players !!!
Yankees literally have a varsity &amp; JV of major league ready players - Frazier -Drury - Wade -McKinney -  Austin - all would be productive major league players on other teams !!!
@JonathanMayo Lol happened to get n late and was watching yankee rewind
Where r living in a day when the truth doesn’t matter &amp; the narrative is most important .. in other words it doesn’t  matter what really happened or was said as long as I said it first and say it louder !!!
@JackCurryYES @shocbomb23 Just goes to show how good he really is as a hitting catcher , expect those on pace numbers to rise cuz he won’t hit this bad all season
I’m guessing we gonna c Johnny Loisigna in the top 💯 prospects very soon !!!! @JonathanMayo
Don’t let all this internet fuckery distract u from the fact yankees demoted  Tyler Austin &amp; Nas releases new music @ 12am
Does Gleyber Torres really have 30 plus Home run power with a high average &amp; minus the occasional brain freeze stellar defense !!! @JackCurryYES sound like a perennial all star to me !!!
Guessing Gary Sanchize should be Happy he’s not a Minnesora Twin , they definitely just sent Miguel Sano down to single A with comparable numbers ?? Ya thoughts
New beginnings stay tuned !! https://t.co/MNUMp9FHGg
@TheLatifah Def not in this case hollywood cast trip is hardly L&amp;HH  england nobody told that lie
@YankeesPR What’s good with 8 what’s he waiting on
Chance Adams goes for Scranton let’s see how this works out tonight   Domingo Acevedo for Trenton should be able to go 5 today   Albert Abreau went 5 innings on runs 6k today looked very good   Junk goes for Charleston
No L&amp;HH England my friends so all u people across the pond can stop dming me !!! wrongly disseminated information by a blogger who didn’t do proper due diligence .. which brings me to my question what’s more important being first or being right ??
Problem with todays blogger is everyone wants to be first!!! They often miss the part that they disseminate wrong info... I’m guessing that’s the problem with a saturated market of people with little experience or credentials trying to make a name !
Sometimes u just have to be mad at yaself for giving them the power !!!
Yankees have been winning  with a bad Hicks , Sanchize &amp; Bird a mediocre Stanton &amp; Gardner an inconsistent Didi and a Judge that isn’t yet locked in &amp; they’re still #1 n runs -ops etc etc pretty scary huh
Greg Bird is the one that needs a break not Andujar - he’s flat out sucked but so has Austin bring Drury up or give walker some at bats
@JackCurryYES  Toe already up and I kinda think Drury comes up soon replacing Austin 1B &amp; DH at bats
Yankee updated after draft top 10 prospects   1 Florial   2 Sheffield  3 Abreau    4 Medina   5 Loisigna   6 D Garcia   7 Acevedo   8 Adams   9 Perez   10 Sauer   Wade - Drury - Frazier - McKinney all pro level players n Scranton   @JonathanMayo Sure u agree lol
Watching these HS kids sign professional deals it appears every player in America signed with Vandy @JonathanMayo
If you’re a yankee fan Loisigna isn’t coming outta nowhere ..  he’s prob a top 5 prospect @ this point !!! Very Good stuff great control was often injured early on , yankees lucked up with this one !!! Can’t guarantee a no hitter but he’s as ready stuff wise as anyone else !!
1 big difference MJ &amp; Bron people didn’t wanna c mike they were intimidated by him &amp; his demeanor , people look 2 attack Bron and bring him down as evidenced by no let down being up 3-0 they wanted to sweep him embarrass him !!! That’s not taking away from his skill ijs 🤷🏾‍♂️
Ok Johnny Lasagna gets blasted n double A today maybe I should pump the breaks a lil @JonathanMayo
@Shayd__1 U earned it
Happy Sunday afternoon , be productive !!!
Yankees farm is throwing   Hale 3A Loisigna 2A Green Hi A  Lenehen Lo A  Excited to Johnny ⚾️ think he’s getting the call next Friday replacing Tanaka
@Jackiebel12 Coming soon the wfan in atlanta
I stand by Domingo German being better then Jordan Montgomery
I remember last year people were discussing who they would rather have Conforto or judge lmao difference a year makes !!!!
@BryanHoch 2 words Johnny Loisigna
Damn Tanaka our for weeks ?? Helloooooooo Johnny Loisigna
@InTheDarkIShine @itskinkcity Some things better left unsaid if I played hurt and hid the injury then keep on hiding it - subs don’t work here
@JonathanMayo did anyone n the Yankee draft jump out at u , maybe a  HS kid or college underclassmen with signability issues that may be coerced into signing  w/ super hi upside ??
@BNightengale Sucks but that’s always been the issue if he’s hurt u lose a bat &amp; pitcher every 5th day !!! The trade off becomes 32 starts or 600 ABs Doing 1 or 300- 350 abs &amp; 15-20 starts doing both
If anyone has folkowed Miguel Andujar they know he doesn’t really lock in until the second half - which could be pretty scary for MLB !!!!!! @JonathanMayo
Yankees relievers lead the Majors with 276K and rank second with a  .208 opponents' BA…rank third in the AL and sixth in the Majors with a  3.17 ERA. And they haven’t played well yet !!!!
Yankees lead MLB in runs per game (5.59), HR (98), HR per game (1.66), OPS (.803) and BB (236)…rank second in runs (330) Red Sox lead by 5 n 5 more games ,SLG (.467), OBP (.336), XBHs (227) and total bases (952). Are on pace to hit 269 HR; the MLB single-season HR record is 264
It’s a good day when ya #9 hitter is hitting 294 with 10 homers &amp; 28 RBIs 1/3 of the way thru that translates to about 30 homers - 84 RBIs at the bottoms of the order !!!!
If Sheffield improves control u can add him to rotation with Acevedo - Abreau - as soon as next season
Still have McKinney - Drury - Frazier - Higgi - Estrada - Torreyes - Wade sitting n 3A with no place to play - all essentially mlb caliber players
Yankee core - Sanchize - Bird - Torres - Didi - Andujar - Frazier - Judge - Hicks - Stanton - thats a whole team 28 &amp; under at this point the farm doesn’t need to be good they have no place for anyone else and yet it’s still gonna be top 10 next season
So lil Wayne’s victory wasn’t the ten million bucks universal gave him but the freedom to be signed with republic records &amp; not cash money was the real victory - no subsidiary he goes theu the major now
Yankees are a half game behind he Red Sox , 23 games over vs 22 games yet the Yankees have a better winning pct 690 - 683 whose actually n first ?? @JackCurryYES
So do the cavs get swept ???
I get the power stroke gets u a homer but bases loaded shift on why not bunt and getthe easy  single &amp; rbi ?? Keep line moving !!! Now u roll over a pitch and he’s out the inning
Questions of the day !!! Do the Cavs hold home court with a victory tonight ?? Do love - JR &amp; Thomphson show up - does Hood get off the bench ??
Good morning tweeps , make it a good one !!!
@BryanHoch And by end of season he’ll b hitting 260 with 35 homers 100 runs &amp; rbis - it’s not like he’s not the catcher no need to look at numbers
@JonathanMayo how do U feel about the Yankees first 2 pics ? I’m kinda feeling like 1 was gimmick  &amp; 2 was crap shoot , as all draft picks are but they definitely had others they coulda used the pic on !!!!! Feel they take intl draft more seriously !!
And y’all wonder why I over due it when the sun comes out !!!! https://t.co/O7QrSms8Z6
@JonathanMayo Why would the Yankees pick this kid so high he’s wasn’t even listed as a first round player ??
@TanGypsyChick What Hotel were u at Fountain blue
So united airlines has mlb network I hear !!!!!!! My new airline I think 🤷🏾‍♂️
@TanGypsyChick Shoulda spoke
One thing I miss about not being n NY anymore is I can’t watch @YESNetwork yankee pregame and postgame coverage not 2 mention the actual games !!!!
@JosinaAnderson @rihanna Sounds bout right doesn’t it ??
On second thought bad day for yankee farm pitchers - Sheffield rocked - Abreau looks nasty
Aaron Judge through June 1st  ⚾ .290 ⚾ 16 HR ⚾ 41 RBI ⚾ .419 OBP ⚾ 42 R  In 53 games not even a third thru yet !!!!! At this pace c below !!!!   290 50 + homers 125 + runs 419 obp  130 + runs   I’d take it
Gleyber is indeed good ?? https://t.co/88FjX7cqkj
U like pitching on the Yankee farm well today is a good day - Sheffield in 3A - Acevedo piggy backing n 2A - Abreau n HiA - &amp; Garcia n low A should be fun
@RyleekB Get some followers trolling ass pussy ya mother &amp; ya bitch love me tho - I take my cock out Dey mouth
All the outrage about  “ slavery was a choice “ yet this dude got bla k folks 2 fly into Wyoming !!!! Congrats Kanye point made
@BaseballAmerica Louis Medina &amp; Johnny Loisigna
Kanye had all them black folk n Wyoming listening to his album &amp; chillin only thing missin was Trump and make America great again merch
@JosinaAnderson Clear who ur rooting for !!
Wooow Lebron is something else !!!! man ole man something else !!!!!
Prediction Torreyes is coming back up Austin headed to Scranton
@BryanHoch @MLBNetwork Most  important bat n lineup apparently
@BryanHoch Aaron Hicks plays Gold Glove caliber D , best defensive alignment is with Gardy n left &amp; Hicks n CF that’s not 2 say Frazier hasn’t earned a shot with his Bat but for now the offense is moving the D is suspect don’t need another suspect defender
@BryanHoch @robneyer He plays good D sometimes u have to go with stellar D instead of projected O hell lookbat Jackie Bradley JR
Hmmm Pusha T !!!!! Oughta get interesting
@Fyocca123 Hamels I’m not enamored with old and as season wears on so will he need a young stud and they don’t exist on the market
My prediction the Yankees need to win the division because a one and done scares me !!!! To much swing and miss and the ability to be shut down by good pitching is nervous !!!!
@Fyocca123 What’s the move for a pitcher cuz torres isn’t going anywhere reigning AL Player of the week Andujar getting comfy at third and CC will remain n rotation
@71djt @iamwandasykes @RoseanneOnABC Nonreally considering the whole damn show is gone
The problem is not that the yankees lose its how they lose !!! careless mistakes , bad pitching , bad fielding !!!! &amp; The real issue is apparently Boston doesn’t lose !!!!
@bsmeazy 💯 agreed
Yankee pitching sucks man !!!! when u play the Astros or a team with good pitching it really shows , u just feel like yankees aren’t gonna score but will need 6 too win
Dope episode
It’s better to walk in the dark with a friend then walk alone in the light !!
Morgan’s last episode on “ criminal minds “ gets me every time https://t.co/UBmmcRv6w2
@AndrewMarchand Bye bye racist
ABC cxls “ Roseanne “ reboot 👋 bitch !!!
I can’t stand racist ass Rosanne just because her and trump had it out doesn’t means she’s invited to the bbq - perfect example ya enemies enemy isn’t always ya friend
First i feel bad for CP3 don’t think harden valued him until the 3rd quarter ended tonight - now with that said I got GS in 5
@CNN Clearly he thought the hype train started &amp; stopped with him but now the other 2 r hugging it out and staying on board Donnie feels silly yet again
@Chris_Broussard And both looked like they were facing Severino
Trump is such an idiot - his Memorial Day message offended the troops just as much as he offends everyone else - self promotion when he should’ve  been paying respects - does it ever end with this guy
@Amirkhary Facts
Harden gotta come thru big tonight !!!! Like lebron big
@BabyFaceMckie @KingDavidsPen Very easy to watch after that comment kinda wish someone ran and kicked her n the face
Hey Brave  fans ya Acuna Prayers were answered - mild ACL sprain nothing serious is good being young snap back game strong 💪🏾
Feel bad for German tough inning struck out Gattis and blind ump issues walk Didi boots grounder shoulda been out the inning or at most been a Solo shot
That quick it’s 3-0 Astros no bueno man damn
@JonathanMayo Johnny Loisigna , Louis Medina or Trevor Stephan
@CEO_RaNGE No bro they wouldn’t a wide open 6’6 man ahead of the field is a no brainer pass knock it off
Cleveland loses to whoever comes out the west n 5-6
Rozier just erased all the good he did no doubt Celtics waiting on kyrie - Jalen brown stunk it up - horford is hella soft - smart can’t shoot a lick
@JonathanMayo how many kids do I have to c graduate before another Yankee cracks the top 💯
@CeoFrizz Where did u hear that ?? Wouldn’t be a bad move with the bullpen issues , then guys have to get right
@chibbs_1 - Still remember u shook that Russian under the scorers table @ gaucho gym many years ago &amp; did the same thing to Bobby Hurley at columbia university gym Golden hoops - classic moments
The rockets have lost games 7-8-9 &amp; 10 golden state in a flow &amp; rhythm now it’s over
Maybe A.J. Cole should stay and one of the other bullpen bums  should go take ya pic holder - Shreve - German - kahnle - Robertson - betances
@BryanHoch Question is who they don’t have any good ones
Why would they expect kahnle to get out when he couldn’t get out in Scranton on Thursday he got lit up
@CeoFrizz Def isnt a trade away unless u giving up the whole farm which why would they for another bat when they clearly need pitching
@CeoFrizz I woulda loved to have him but u mus5 not b an Andujar fam cuz that’s who they wanted
I wanna check on a Greg 🦅 ID he look 60
Shoulda fucking sent gray down and kept Torreyes
@JonathanMayo Definitely swings the bat always said he reminds me of Beltre minus the plate discipline and stellar D
This kid doesn’t have a chance throwing 92 mph 2 this yankee lineup
@JonathanMayo we’ve been preaching the Andujar sermon for quite sometime so I know u can appreciate this comment coming from me - he has absolutely no range at third
Doesn’t matter who catches Gray he sucks point blank period I haven’t lost my focus cuz he pitched☝️good game
Tanaka has sucked but honestly nobody else from the free agent market is any better - Darvish now hurt
A pitcher shoulda been sent down in my humble opinion
I did 2 Torreyes made little sense when randomly used pitchers remain n bullpen
@keithlaw Backlash will b unprecedented
@keithlaw  is Luke Heimlich gonna get drafted ??
@jimcallisMLB is Luke Heimlich gonna get drafted ??
@JonathanMayo is Luke Heimlich gonna get drafted ??
So @Bergdorfs drops packages off without requiring signature now my fucking shoes r floating around the universe on someone elese feet - most ridiculous shit I’ve heard yet
Big Toe unfair casualty of roster crunch- wonder how that convo went ??!!
The love affair with this 8 man bullpen is ridiculous literally A.J. Cole pitches once every 2 weeks
@xvgabexv @JackCurryYES Well considering they get the 26th man for the double dip that makes no sense
@f1ghtsamurai @rambledove @colbycolb And he walked in and out the prelim hearings and is still free on appeal which is why u should  think before tweeting thank u my point has been made
Wow big Toe gets sent down which makes me wonder if Lind wanted out or is Ford just that guy now !!! Damn so Big Toe not Austin , I guess ??!!
@TMZ If ratings were good the decision woulda been tougher
@JackCurryYES so whose driving Tyler 2 Scranton
@CeoFrizz Very special got some all star games in him starting with this year -will win ROY after othani inevitably slows down he’ll bat 260 with era over 4 when it’s Said &amp; done
@PeterKerasotis @JackCurryYES Nooooo keep Gardy there they’re winning no pressure n 9 hole pitchers have no reprieve Gleyber hits 25 homers 900ops and becomes an allstar plenty of time to hit lead off he’s 21
@rambledove @colbycolb Sounds bout right Rich privilege
@CeoFrizz Actually only when I c selling warming for his second inning - he shuts them down. When going 1
@BryanHoch Don’t forget yaself my Man U were right before Sanchize
@JackCurryYES He’s been saving it for the big dance
Never thought I’d say this but watching Dave Robertson warm up gives me Tyler Clippard flashbacks
Judge is absolutely a 5 tooo stud runs - hits - power/patience - defends - and a cannon that defensive WAR on the rise
@alexriveraa24 @BryanHoch He won’t even be n the majors after tomorrow that’ll def hurt his chances
@BryanHoch I voted for GT also but we all know Otani is gonna get ROY adding the pitching stats make this easy it’s clear ya followers are Yankee fans
@JonathanMayo time for the Yankees to start stockpiling intl bonus money for the Vega Vega kid from Cuba
Warriors catch a huge break , with NO CP3 for game 6 they’re almost assured it goes back to houston for a one &amp; done ! Pressure will be on Rockets @ Home &amp; looking for first finals Berth
@SiirBrock Snap been dead since Jenner shot them then later Riri buried them
@TMZ U gonna go back to DALLAS and u Miami and u Nyc what an ignorant fuck he is
Oh and none of today’s action has me forgetting that the Republicans wanna be  repub governor of Ga is riding around on a bus looking to lock up illegals and the NFL just dreaded free speech and expression with the whole kneeling thing
Damn “ Star “ was good as hell 2 shit actually mad tonight was last ep
Can’t front Empire finally was crazy !!!
Yankees bullpen should be ashamed of itself can’t keep a 4 run lead against the rangers
@CeoFrizz Yes indeed and while everyone talking bout betances don’t b distracted by the fact Robertson is worse
How tall is Gelo Ball if he’s 6’8 he’s got a shot on some 3&amp; D type shit !!!!
Gardy LF Judge RF Bird 1B Stanton DH Sanchize C  Gregorius SS Hicks CF Andujar 3B  Torres 2B  Dream on that Yankee Fans
Be careful when u look for attention cuz  these days u never know what attention ya attention will get u !!!
Wednesday the middle of ya  work week go hard finish 💪🏾 Memorial weekend is upon us !!!!
@TheGreatWhite Next year if they don’t he’ll b n the mix but Stanton will start in left if Gardy goes
@baseball_ref They don’t
@TheGreatWhite Yeah I see DH n his future with Gardy out next year messes things up for the Fraziers &amp; Austin’s of the world tho that’s at bats taken from them
@BryanHoch How many of them passed balls / wild pitches were on Sanchize
@TheGreatWhite Were the wild pitches his fault ??
@TrentonThunder @JonathanMayo please tell me Johnny Loisigna isn’t hurt leaving the game after 3 -1 run innings &amp; 63 pitches
Having alotta time to watch the Braves games and these young kids r the truth Albies - Acuna - Swanson &amp; Freeman remind me of last years yankees ahead of schedule just like them !!!!!
2017     2018  AVG      261   263  HR          11      11  RBI         30     28  SLG      .527   520  Won NL MVP in 2017 w/.281 AVG, 59 HR, 132 RBI  Gincarlo Stanton stats Pretty scary right ??
People forget Aaron Judge was very high &amp; very low last year if he can stay consistently in the are he is now I think it’s possible he replicates or exceeds last years numbers
@Fyocca123 Yes for sure horrid start ran outta characters Tanaka has sucked - gray inconsistent cc good Severino great German I for 2 but Montgomery was pretty good
Sanchez good power number bad avg - obp Austin good power &amp; avg bad splits  Torres beastin Didi horrible slump  Andujar no eye swings @ everything no walks at all 2 many ks Gardner recently decent  Judge - been n slump obp and power still ridiculous  Hicks nothing special good d
We gonna find out Bartolo Colon is Gleyber Torres uncle or some shit - he serving them up on a T for the kid !!!!
@reneegraziano Yes indeed Grazi we def do and def will
@CosbySugar @AndrewMarchand No worries yankees on mlb network tonight &amp; wed on ESPN so u good it’s cloudy out anyway watch the games
Hold up lemme understand this  - Didi mired in ridiculous slump couple days off ok I get it but Tues - Wed rained out Thursday travel day 3 off days n total why would Andujar need a day after going 3-5 with a homer &amp; triple I’m confused @AndrewMarchand
Hold up lemme understand this  - Didi mired in ridiculous slump couple days off ok I get it but Tues - Wed rained out Thursday travel day 3 off days n total why would Andujar need a day after going 3-5 with a homer &amp; triple I’m confused @JackCurryYES
@reneegraziano Yup that’s usually how it works
Andujar graduated from the top 💯 next will be Torres next up will be Florial - Sheffield - Abreau - Adams - Madina &amp; I think Loisigna jumps behind Abreau n top 30 &amp; 100
@thegooglefact Google stole all that yahoo shine hello gmail !!!
Wonder how Boone plays tomorrow out with the personal catcher thing or maybe the day game after night game reason but Sanchize hit 2 HR tonight so u want him n - Stanton hit 1 so that’s ya DH spot and Frazier played will does Gardy sit again
Dunno what the deal is but I’m sick of yankees giving up runs on the bases - Boone needs to get his coaches and or players n order @JackCurryYES
Rise &amp; shine &amp; give God the glory glory !!!!
Gleyber was really bad today and cost the Yankees 3 runs unacceptable brain freeze today can’t have that behind CC he needs the defenders be on A games period
@_BirdieJackson Yikes
@baseball_ref So what second Game he got touched bldont care bout walks only runs
Ohhh myyy 😍😍😍😍😍😍 https://t.co/8IxHUHVD9p
@YankeesGirl2113 Def don’t need Harper would be ridiculous to spend that money - now with that said we need a pitcher or 2 or 3 so that would be the wise investment
@JackCurryYES I saw something that said the Yankee games were cxled are both done over or is one continuing from 3-3 so technically 13 innings to go
understand records sold &amp; certifications isn’t what they used to be people are now going platinum &amp; gold thru streams which isn’t a sold record or album - people r going gold &amp; plat having sold 100kbalbums total which n another date &amp; time would be a flop
Don’t let the fact the Yankees r winning hide the fact that Tanaka has a 5.03 era which means he sucks as bad as the guys we woulda got had he left
@bsmeazy No way not even performing at double A warranting promotion-swing &amp; miss is real
@BNightengale Maybe this needs to be fixed it tarnished a future HOF player and if it’s not performance enhancing it is indeed a glitch
@InfoBoosting Send me one I’ll promote it
Gardy doesn’t resign Stanton takes over left now u have  more room for everyone with an open DH
@LivPopeCams I dunno maybe cuz it’s my page what I selling pussy - hit dogs howl
@YankeesPR Good thing @RiverAveBlues doesn’t make the decisions cuz they def left this one out of the latest What to do with drury saga
@Fyocca123 All star game naw Altuve gonna win the vote but he’ll be n thya mix
@GloriousQueenn Same thing I been doing all my life
So is it safe to say all these women pretending to be traveling the world yet never post pics of anyone they’re traveling with are escorting via the DM - don’t Blow a gasket I’m asking for a friend
Drake going on tour with migos y’all here for it ??
@AndrewMarchand Yankees will be fine just the way they are hopefully they win division and he bounces boston out the playoffs !!!!!
Yankee all stars   C- Sanchize   SS - Gregorius   RF - Judge   DH - Stanton   P - Severino   RP - Chapman
And all of a sudden Stanton is batting 252 with a 855 ops
@mamajeweldollaz @stacy_chick Good thing life won’t change at all after this u expected , irrelevant then of events
When Yankees get 🦅 &amp; Drury back I think they’ll rid themselves of the last reliever &amp; Austin gets demoted but moving Andujar isn’t an option he need to play and improve at this level period !!!!!
@stacy_chick Being factual is the best defense against slander
Can’t even advocate for u bro 5 runs in one inning against the As not acceptable gotta stop the bleeding dude the As r terrible
@InfoBoosting need this ASAP I’ll promote on Mu social media !!
@BleacherReport And saying dumb shit like that is why he won’t ever get a coaching job well amongst other reasons
Funny when motherfuckas so worried bout u they can’t help but be consumed with shit u don’t think twice about - but if they had any life they wouldn’t be worried about yours !!!!! Get a life
@billmaher who is this fucking idiot u have on ya show like seriously I blame ya team for even booking him and he’s a Congressmen from cali like seriously common man why even give them a voice on ya show
@BryanHoch Love this kid as well but U just hit a homer and ya batting 350 wtf u bunting for we using the hottest hitter in the team for sac opportunities
@Fresko024 Smart move they gave away an out and got 1 run that worked out swimmingly
Kids hitting 350 just went deep why is he sad bunting giving away an out - shoulda swing the bat in my opinion
@BrendanKutyNJ Kinda of obvious it’s not working Gray and his personal catcher can get the hell outta NY
Cashman has done an amazing job rebuilding the Yankees on the fly w/o tanking but the Sonny Gray deal isn’t one of the better ones - take solace n knowing they didn’t have room for Fowler - Mateo is stinking it up and KAP hasn’t pitched since he was 12
Hmmmn wonder if Gary Sanchez snuck behind the plate for this game - how bout it’s not Sanchize it’s Gray &amp; the personal catcher shit needs to go away as Gray does @JackCurryYES
51 pitches 3-2/3 inning 0 hits 2 w 3ks and Sheffield was pulled any reason why @swbrailriders @jimcallisMLB
Awwwwe shit my man “ handle like van exel “ is coming to NY it’s about to be litttttttt
@SiirBrock U got it
Bro how many times we gonna fucking do this shit stop using Betances for multiple innings wtf how many times
@SiirBrock Whoever made them joggers tellem I need a pair
@SiirBrock No sir def is not
Joe Girardi somewhere like damn was benching Sanchize &amp; not answering the bullpen phone for Cash even worth it these guys can’t lose even with Boone trying to give away games
@mondo_muzic Man facts I’m sure action Jackson is still sickbhe couldn’t get along with management
Summer is here won’t see another sleeve until February #20inchgunz https://t.co/14jlAz9DlL
Joe Girardi is somewhere sick Aaron Boone gets to manage this team - at this point yankees are manager proof cuz Boone has definitely made some bone head moves but as previously stated manager proof the way binder joe would lovem
Sears - Green - Swanson - Whitlock  and Loisigna all have outstanding results so far we know Johnny ⚾️ has A1 stuff future 2-3 What r these other guys looking like ceiling wise ??? @JonathanMayo
They honored my mom tonight @CityTechNews - thank u for everything we r now retired !!!!! https://t.co/A0GYry3izn
7- Acevedo looks good dealing with blister   8- Perez looks bad really bad   9- adams overated as I thought from the beginning maybe back to the pen upside maybe Chad Green   10- Medina could be higher let’s c hear he’s headed to  Charleston soon
One month in  Yankee top 10 prospect list   1-Torres looks amazing  2- Andujar defense just fine bat is as big time as we thought  3- Sheffield looks really good   4- Abreau just getting back from  injury   5- Loisigna new entry he’s “a guy “   6-Florial swing &amp; miss worrisome@
Just preaching about Johnny Loisigna bearing a beast as he gives up an 0-2 homer Fuuuuck
@JonathanMayo not yet but n a couple games we are gonna have to speak about Jonny Loisigna for this huge jump into ya top 💯 like unranked into the top 50 mid season jump - will b 23 all season - stuff insane - control pinpoint &amp; most importantly looks healthy
@jimcallisMLB not gonna say anything yet but a couple more games we are gonna have to speak about Jonny Loisigna for this huge jump into ya top 💯 like unranked into the top 50
The Yanks have to get better defensively &amp; the coaches have to be better. Yanks have run into the second most outs on bases so far this season that’s not acceptable &amp; Aaron Boone has been a bad manager - winning in spite of mistakes is huge but that has to be cleaned up
The Yankees are playing like this &amp; Gardy - Stanton - Sanchize - Hicks - Walker still no 🦅 yet and the rest haven’t even found the rhythm yet beware ⚾️ !!!!!
@AndrewMarchand They don’t deserve a radio telecast the team sucks and the arena is too dark
@MichaelRapaport @NBA @nyknicks Let’s get the roster In order cuz White frankly nobody gonna win with that roster and 2 think they coulda had Spyda Mitchell
@RealSkipBayless Bro u just sound dumb it’s  bout time for me to unfollow u... I’m no lebron fan but the level of hate u demonstrate is inordinate and quite frankly kinda weird like some hidden feelings ur trying to conceal
Monday is here another chance for a great &amp; productive week get up get out &amp; get something !!! Remember creating ya own opportunities &amp; having ya own is the greatest feeling In The world !!!!!!
@BrendanKutyNJ hmmm I just saw that you compared Gardy 2 Stanton n the mail bag u gotta be kidding right difference in ops around 300 power numbers &amp; rbi as well u had to be kidding - Stanton isn’t good but Gardy has been terrible let’s not mix them up
Blankenship being even remotely in consideration for this WVA post says much more about WVA then it does about him !!!! Just sayin
@Buster_ESPN I hate when people say he’s on pace for as if a sprinter can run a marathons race like he would run a 200 - who cares what the pace is 30 games in whenbu literally have 132 to go
@JoeFaceBecker Yes indeed they look amazing
@Robfeliz Indeed and he’s just begun he better the Montgomery I’ve said that since last season
@missfree Stop it Free
@KingDavidsPen Fuck a petition justbdont but the shits and they will go away
@BNightengale Wasn’t good enough earlier this week but whatever 🤔
How bout them yankee Rookies
@lazofficial @LazAlonso2 My bad bro that’s my other page lmao
Knowing ya value goes both ways don’t be the only one that’s thinks that highly of u - it’s absolutely counterproductive
@JoeFaceBecker Decatur
@CeoFrizz Yes indeed the youngsters look good Tyler - Gleyber &amp; Miguel all look like they belong n the bigs for a long time
@Jwebb2413 @BryanHoch @DidiG18 Didi always spoke english and 3-4 other languages or something like that don’t make ill advised parallels- Didi and Gleyber have absolutely no similarities
@JoeFaceBecker Wipes forehead !!!
@JoeFaceBecker 5-3 Astros that quick
@JoeFaceBecker That quick jinxed them that quick
@JoeFaceBecker Blew it
@JoeFaceBecker Looking good actually looks great I’ll take this road trip
@eboland11 Speaking of hyperbole what I do wanna know is where the Yankee prospects rank on base ball America’s update anyone moving up anyone new crack the 100
@BryanHoch What yankees moved up and in baseball America’s first prospect updates
https://t.co/SqcJrluHXD
@TI3RRV_ 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔
@TI3RRV_ Me
I agree but we can wait til allstar and see where we r
@TI3RRV_ We got that swag I am ya swag !!😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Hate to c Gumby hurt but if you watch the Yankees then u know this injury not crushing German will be fine and pitch just as good as Montgomery did so knock it off
@eboland11 Bro nobody worth noting wanted him cut or benched anyone who has a clue didn’t want that - getting warm he’ll heat up always does please refrain from hyperbolic tweets
What Yankees r on baseball America’s updated top 💯 my log in is messed up
@BryanHoch As he should he’s deserved a shot
Damn i guess Dillon Tate isn’t it he tricked me with a couple great starts !!!!
@mamajeweldollaz Not the same Energy w/o “ bitch “ n the joke wanna wake your significant other or better half  just doesn’t hit right
@BryanHoch Very simple Domingo German gets his shot and cashes in !!!! Done the end
@TI3RRV_ Me getting on top of u
@TI3RRV_ Like how
@Robfeliz I’m n atl no k - cone or flash
@Bif0924 Naw hate we sent him to the chi I liked him
Kind of annoying MLB network is dick riding the Verlander performance that was indeed superb but please realize its 3-0 which means the vaunted Astros offense hasn’t scored either &amp; has 2 runs n 2 games to this point just saying Bob Costas
Sanchize !!!!!
@BryanHoch Don’t think anyone cares how many ks they have not the 1 run since they landed is the issue
@TI3RRV_ Why must u say dumb shit over twitter
@missmilo24 By hoe
@_mermaidbarbie Back soon n a new city very soon
@Jadie_Padie Exactly my point just like the late Hugh Hefner but if he started spewing hatred racism &amp;!everything else trump has stood for he’d  lose his urban cool card as well not rocket science why doesn’t Kanye get it - excuse lack of punctuation I’m thoroughly disappointed
Fuck the fact that he said he loved trump and tried to rationalize it with rap videos from 2002 before trump wired all his beliefs all his thoughts all his actions with racism and hatred Kanye is so lost so ignorant and indefensible
Please tell me this shit Kanye said on @TMZ was some type of spoof  joke something not real -please tell me this man didn’t just say slavery of 400 years was a choice please please please say he didn’t just do that
@JonathanMayo I’m starting to get pissed off media is saying Andujar has never been a prospect the kid is 23 been on the top 💯 for the last 2 seasons and been ranked in the 3B top 10 even longer - hell media gets paid to know prospects so they should know prospects so annoying
@TI3RRV_ Go back to bed 🛏
@TI3RRV_ Stop drinking
@TI3RRV_ Lol
U wanna wake yo bitch up? Jangle yo keys😂😂🤓🤡🤷🏿‍♂️
@CeoFrizz Yes they do 1 or 2
@JoeFaceBecker Yanks will get 2 I hope that’ll be a nice west coast trip 5-2 anything better would be icing
@JoeFaceBecker As did I smh had shots at the end Hicks swinging wild like he n lol league &amp; Didi didn’t come thru this time
Not mad at sonny Gray today I’ll take 6 innings 2 runs everyday and twice on Sunday
@JonathanMayo meanwhile everyone is talking about Andujar and his D yes Drury had 3 errors today not this week or this month but today n Scranton 🤔😌🤔
Can we please stop acting like it matter who catches Sonny Gray he suck bottom line - the end it’s not Sanchize or Romine or Johnny Bench it’s him
@SiziSev Hilarious
Ohh wow didn’t realize that well he can’t be an asshole and hit under 250 with no power he might wanna be a nice guy
@AndrewMarchand A-Rod should do games alone
Traded Yankees   Fowler-  batting 264 ops under 700   Mateo - batting 164 w/4sbs OPS under 600   KAP - hasn’t pitched yet   Guzman 4IP 0era 1 Game n high A  Littel getting rocked   Clarkin getting rocked   Rutherford 364 avg with no power
@seanmohen @Buster_ESPN If u think Andujar and Torres are backups you’re misinformed they are the futures
@lookin4oz1980 @Evelynn_Nickole Get ya eyes checked
That quickly the Yankees have the third best record n baseball
@Evelynn_Nickole Don’t look shit like me
@JonathanMayo On another note if Drury comes back &amp;  does anything but DH &amp; pick up his first base mitt we have serious issues Andujar is a beast period the end - Drury is a serviceable third baseman  Andujar is a ⭐️
@JonathanMayo Lol Yeah I think he may have but I meant Andujar reminded me of Beltran mannerisms - bat speed and swag while he was n Trenton &amp; Scranton meaning Andujar n minors
@JonathanMayo I c a lot of Adrian Beltre n Andujar offensively obviously long way to go before we can actually make that comparison but he def reminds me of Beltre even n the minors
Very disappointing the Yankees won’t commit to Miguel Andujar at @ least n the short he deserves vote of confidence he certainly would be ROY @ this point if not 4 Otani -I imagine that’s what yanks do not commit @ send down ROY level players @JackCurryYES
Just to put the Sanchize n perspective he’s 1st n runs 3rd n doubles 1 n homers 1st n RBIs 4th in slugging &amp; 7th n ops all while batting 193 &amp; thats MLB not just AL - safe to say when he gets hot he’ll be the best offensive catcher by a zillion miles not even close
@JackCurryYES don’t agree with pinch hitting for Torreyes kinda worked out but why Toe has good speed is a contact hitter not 2 mention he’s been super clutch why why why now they lose the DH tontop it off bad move - almost guarantee a toe hit n that spot
@AndrewMarchand don’t agree with pinch hitting for Torreyes kinda worked out but why Toe has good speed and is a contact hitter not 2 mention he’s been super clutch why why why
Yanks lead the majors in runs (146), runs per game (6.08), home runs (39), HR per game (1.63), OBP (.352), slugging (.475), OPS (.826) and TB (392). Rank second in walks (111) and extra base hits (94) - that’s with bad Sanchize - Stanton Gardner no 🦅 &amp; a blind Drury
@TI3RRV_ Roll over and hit the lights I’m still sleepy too
@JonathanMayo if Johnni Loisigna keeps pitching like this an immediate promotion will be n order  &amp; he should def be top 75 on midelseason update - whatcha think ??
@TI3RRV_ My back shots gone get u right
Walk it off !!!!!! Sanchize https://t.co/aRgLnTI7Fh
I mean I imagine at some point Didi ,Judge , Austin &amp; Andujar will slow down Hicks - Sanchize Stanton Gardy &amp; Walker  will begin to hit
@Kelvinb78665830 I sure did sticking to the regiment u sent me
Quietly Yanks have best offense n majors and Stanton isn’t hitting nor is Sanchize &amp; still no Bird but quite frankly they couldn’t have asked for much more outta first base with TA
@JonathanMayo is Tyler Austin’s bat this legit cuz right now he looks like a 250 25-30 homer 850 ops guy which even if a Bird comes back has serious value on the market D isn’t as bad as people say he’s serviceable
Didi is insane right now woooooow !!!
On the farm - Sheffield - Tate - losiagna - Stephan r all dealing Acevedo was before he had the blister issue but my guy Frecier Perez having his issues
@TI3RRV_ Very representative dont U have a man
@TI3RRV_ Actually said he is out of the sunken place
@BryanHoch @MLB Maybe some good fortune will turn things around for them - wonder when baseball gonna award Tyler Austin his hit from the other day
@TI3RRV_ You’d look nuts
@TI3RRV_ U doin a whole lot today
@TI3RRV_ For  what
Fun fact Didi wasn’t even playing at this time last year
@TVbytheNumbers still looking for them Monday cable numbers
@TI3RRV_ Say it again babe
@Robfeliz @BryanHoch Man I dunno take ya time Greg - TA ballin !!!
@JackCurryYES question of the day Jack is YESNDIDI gonna hit 35 bombs this year - I say yup
@JackCurryYES Tell Drury dust off that 2nd base &amp; 1B glove he will be what Walker was supposed to be before he’s Cut
@andaqueviaje @JackCurryYES Babip will be high as long as he smoke everything
@NUYORKCITY @JackCurryYES Severino - Green  - Chapman * - Judge - Sanchez - Stanton - Didi *   * will be deserving but Fans will have to get out and vote
@Robfeliz @BryanHoch Yes indeed then they will have full compliment of horses
@BryanHoch Kids a beast will be rookie of the year if the guy n Anaheim falters at all
@JonathanMayo I love it when a plan comes together Andujar on his way runner up rookie of the year if The dude n Anaheim falters he’ll be ya rookie of the year
@Buster_ESPN Absolutely rigth Buster the conditions have not been So Cal but he’s still raking w/o the shoulder injury last season his numbers would’ve been even more unworldly- let’s c I’m predicting 280 avg  45 homers 115 runs &amp; 110 RBIs
@TheRealDaytime @drocktrot Reality is if people watch and money is generated this question has already been answered
@CNN Apology not accepted go to hell just shows she didn’t do her due diligence
@TMZ Why do u continue to even post the dumb shit she says that the only motivation to say such ridiculously blasphemous things - tMZ time
@AndrewMarchand Keep the jz  “reasonable doubt “ references minimal “ brainless vs famous and he’ll be aight
Keep ya head up keep pushing and run ya own race don’t look left or right and u will get what’s coming to u. N time
@JonHeyman That’s 2 bad calls no overturns cu the yankee play was flagrantly bad
@TI3RRV_ Stop talking tough marshmallow
@JackCurryYES How can that ever happen like seriously how can u watchbthat from multiple angles and not get that correct
@ItsjustJimmy @Buster_ESPN Both losers same principle begging for any glory mets nets will never run NY wether knicks - yankees go 0-82 or 0 - 162
@ItsjustJimmy @Buster_ESPN Just like a net fan gloating 20 games into the season when the reality is y’all won’t be around come all Star - I guess u take what u can when u root for the guys n queens
@TI3RRV_ Cornball shit only dick n her is mine
@Buster_ESPN As amazing as that stat line would be it will never happen
@bsmeazy Better be 2nd the way Andujar is swinging the bat the future is Gleyber @ 2nd &amp; Andujar @ 3rd
@bsmeazy He needs to play better not playing well at all b AA Tampa prob won’t be promoted at this rate
@TI3RRV_ Don’t u have a man ??
@TI3RRV_ U mine we win all day every day
Yankee  top prospect graduations  Andujar - Torres   New top 💯 prospects  Tate - Acevedo - Medina - Estrada - loisigna -    Total top 100s  Sheffield - Florial - Adams. - Abreau  - Madina - loisigna - maybe Acevedo - Tate - Estrada
@tmiddaugh39 @Joelsherman1 and wasn’t much of anything before
Better be Yankee Lineup tomorrow   LF Gardner  RF Judge  SS Didi  DH Stanton  C Sanchize  CF Hicks  3B Andujar  1B Austin  2B Torres    Super excited if Stanton &amp; Sanchize get going u looking at 6-8 runs a game   !!!!!
Hearing Gleyber is on the way to NY  so umm Wade or a pitcher might be headed down cuz it better not be Andujar - maybe Domingo
All of a sudden Andujar is batting 255 with an 810 ops &amp; below 15 pct K rate hmmmm Torres needs to be working out at 2nd base period @Jonmayo we were right yet again
@keithlaw Never heard so much chitter chatter bout getting that ass beat either u kick my butt or I kick yours either way not complaining about things I can control gettem out throw him out but don’t complain once he’s on
Yankees digging a nice lil hole for themselves Boston is the definition of running away &amp; hiding still early but when leads are n double digits it’s always a mountain to climb gonna need a nice 20-5 streak
Can we stop the Torres @ 3rd talk Miguel is a beast and will be fine at the hot corner everyone wanna give wade 5 years of reprieve but yet send Andujar down after 25 Abs
Never been a fan of sonny gray would’ve saved that package added Frazier &amp; Adams and got Fulmer or even done a prospect for prospect trade with the braves they have a glutton on the mound !!! Bad live cash but n theory itbsounded good
This is the best yankee lineup until Bird is healthy &amp; Austin sits &amp; Torres is called up &amp; Toe is utility think Andujar is about to go on a tear &amp; become the 280 20 homer 800 ops guy I said he would Drury who ??? https://t.co/LXwr4I228X
@MichaelRapaport Common mike u telling me U don’t remember the release date of ya first movie or when u got that first million dollar check
@DaBreo_ @alexgz27 @BryanHoch Name the ten better
What is this unwavering confidence n Tyler Wade it’s getting more obvious he can’t hit major league pitching yet they pretend Torrea doesn’t need to be playing 2nd base instead of third can u explain this pleases @AndrewMarchand
What is this unwavering confidence n Tyler Wade it’s getting more obvious he can’t hit major league pitching yet they pretend Torrea doesn’t need to be playing 2nd base instead of third can u explain this pleases @JonathanMayo
Ellsbury - Frazier- Hicks  - Bird - Drury - kahnle - Warren - Heller - all been on DH already   Wade 091 - walker 189  - Stanton 191 - Sanchez 203 batting averages   Not enough characters to even begin talking bout bullpen   So with that 8-8 sounds amazing
So why wouldn’t Andujar be playing  tonight smh he starts heating up and u give him a break after a day off can I please make sense of this @JackCurryYES
New work out plan started today bout to be all lean muscle no bulk !!! https://t.co/BdUMjfEjN9
If the Red Sox play 15-2 ball for the rest of the season I’ll concede the season - people get so amped up &amp; we’re not even in the 20 game area - relax people talk to me after 100 games I promise you yankees will be right there
Hell he’s as bad as wade  Torres needs to play second Andujar needs to play third
@IDONTGIVEAFLIP I dunno meatball maybe saving character space - how bout u unfollow me and you’ll never have that issue seeing numbers again
Kenny Smith is my guy an Arch Bishop Malloy Queens guy but coach of the NY Knicks I dunno - think this search should start &amp; bend in BK Bishop Loughlin
@CNN He’s a idiot for sure living in his own world
@TMZ The facts y’all even ask her music questions is a joke fuck outta here
@MariahLynBoss I’m down for the collab u do the record I do richie D drops take dat take dat
@bigsantiago That’s my point people / media  should not be worried about Gleyber being called up he’ll be here soon enough let’s handle the issues at hand - the team on the field is the worry
Why media &amp; fans screaming bout Gleyber when Stanton is terrible Betances is terrible Tanaka is terrible Wade is terrible Walker is terrible Sanchize is terrible shouldn’t  everyone be worried what’s terrible in Ny instead of what’s n Scranton
@SiirBrock Facts trying to be like u !!!
https://t.co/AHbWrHRpB5
I’m guaranteeing you someone with no record sales , streams or records sold would be n the mix for any awards except maybe BET awards
Sad day when  “ cash/ catch me outside “ girl is nominated for a billboard award for best female rap artist - what I don’t understand is why people are mad they downloaded / streamed &amp;!bought her music so what did they reasonably expect
Maybe now that Andujar is hitting we can stop pretending like the Yankees need a 3b &amp; Torres can go back to splitting time between the 3 non 1b infield spots
@BryanHoch The question is why is he being recalled
https://t.co/Rciqks8bcY
Andujar 2-4 with 2 just miss Home Runs kids coming around let’s give him some at bats before Gleyber switches positions like seriously why do other players have longer leash “ Tyler Wade “ with no where near the upside
@BaseballAmerica Guessing intl national league player of week doesn’t make the hot sheet gotcha
@BenBadler No respect for this prospect with the glaring omission of Gleyber Torres or Johnny lasagna
what’s worse 1) getting arrested 4 waiting 4 someone @ Starbucks 2) being taken out in cuffs 4 waiting 4 someone n Starbucks 3) being taken 2 jail 4 waiting 4 someone n Starbucks 4) being held for 8 hrs 4 waiting 4 someone n Starbucks - ask me all unacceptable Starbucks
Beyoncé isn’t human - she actually a national treasure
You would think with all the cameras &amp; people that Starbucks would’ve refrained from being the next company on the fuck off list 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ but now they much incur  the wrath
@fangraphs This proves to me that defense matters well rounded players will always have war edge judge will be n this group very soon
Not the size of the lion n the fight  It’s the size of the fight in the lion   Do remember
@JonathanMayo Dillon Tate &amp; Jonny Lasagna looking like  top 💯 guys thus far - Torres - Andujar will be replaced by  Medina / Tate / loisgna
@mamajeweldollaz Nope but he started a brawl after being hit by pitch - man after my own heart ❤️
I think I love Tyler Austin a lil bit !!!!
@YoureIt_Not_It Not giving up on anyone just turned channel tonight I’m back tomorrow for Tanaka time
I’m not watching this bullshit any longer fuck the Yankees fuck Severino fuck Stanton fuck judge and the rest of them bums
Severino has got to start coming thru n big games like an ace never comes thru n the clutch thus far n his career
US chart preview update: Cardi B's 'Invasion of Privacy' now pacing for #1 with 215-225k units (90-100k pure). Pretty damn good if u ask me
@BNightengale @BovadaLV And it’s April so do we really care what all these ridiculous odds are
I guess yankee fans can take solace n knowing 2  things (1) nobody cares about the Mets (2) the Red Sox r due for a bad streak they won’t play 8-1 ball forever
Bullpen loses another one unreal
@bsmeazy Scored 7 today with hat minor league lineup shiuldve been enough
@bsmeazy Disagree Drury - Walker - Andujar Toe - and supposedly wade was a top prospect no team has a killer 1-9 maybe Astros or Sawx but u don’t need an all star at every spot actually kinda wack to have that but the bullpen has blown leads or they’d have 2 more n w column
@ish_since89 Was supposed to be easy for yankees 2 Tampa - Bmore and Toronto 6 of 9 n the friendly confines meanwhile boston looks amazing again today coming back down 7
@bsmeazy Yup no bueno bullpen has really been the culprit before today starters have been ok
Montgomery spotted 5-0 lead and can’t get thru 4 unbelievable
If u didn’t think shit was real before Romine - Austin - Walker - Toe &amp; Andujar that’s todays infield - why the hell would Didi get the day off with off day tomorrow not 2 mention Peterson n left !!!
Pitching isn’t the issue would’ve been undefeated based on starting pitching the bullpen has let us down as have the bats period - and German will be very good while CC is down
Yankees had Toronto - Tampa &amp; Bmore starting the season perfect way to get out quick &amp; alleviate some pressure quite frankly they look weak right now !!! Boston &amp; houston look much better so far much
@mamajeweldollaz Facts
Woooow yankee DL is crazy CC - Drury - Hicks - Ellsbury- Frazier  - Bird &amp; McKinney not to mention wade being sick &amp; Sanchize cramping up
Holder has to be sent down and German comes up I mean it only makes sense at this point
@baseball_ref Funny Stanton isn’t on list anyone by virtue of being a yankee he should never be omitted from the top name on any list he qualifies for
@ovationtv @janizbee2 Allen Shore of course best lawyer ever
@clintfrazier Yes indeed let’s go Red Thunder we gotta make up for lost time
Do yaself a favor binge  watch “ Boston Legal “ on Saturday’s &amp; “ The Practice “ on Sunday’s on @ovationtv do yaself a favor tell me what u think of 2 of my favorite shows
@ovationtv  quickly becoming my favorite channel I work so I have to DVR “ Boston Legal “ &amp; now “ The Practice “  but you guys made my day with those two shows
@HaniDav83 Definitely as a pro all u do is shoot and work J Kidd went from no threes to all threes later n his career - Ben will get the shot and when he does woooooow
@HaniDav83 If say for a veteran 16-8-8 is solid and all star worthy that’s basically a triple double if he made feee throws he’d be 20-8-8 all star and all NBA numbers nothing to do with rookie I said once n a decade type talent
@CrimMinds_CBS Damn I missed it when can I catch on demand
@JonathanMayo Trenton looks pretty ridiculous so I guess as Acevedo - Sheffield &amp; Tate roll as will the kids.. I fully expect Abreau healthy soon &amp; in Trenton buy July !!!! Perez &amp; Losiagna if pitching well should move fast especially Johnny with his 40 man situation
@piercebmw Injured last year not clear on ya point
-Equated “2 sides” re Charlottesville -Called black athetes, “sons of bitches” -Attacked John Lewis -Silent when black men abused/killed by bad cops -Called African countries “shit-holes” -Said Haitians have AIDS  If u support or are Trump, pls spare us the #MLK50 tweets. Really.
@JonathanMayo  the Yankees advanced A rotation is pretty ridiculous  gonna be exciting to watch  -Perez  - Abreau - losigiana - all n same rotation 4 potential top 100 players Florial starting n Tampa as well
@MLBPipeline @MiLB @mlbbowman @RhettBollinger @AdamMcCalvy @BryanHoch @m_sheldon @brianmctaggart @adamdberry @AJCassavell @scottmerkin Yankees advanced A rotations is ridiculous
They say Ben Simmons can’t shoot but no matter how u look at  it he’s averaging 16 - 8 - 8 his rookie season - mid range Game &amp; ability to go up &amp; down the floor alleviates lack of 3 point shooting - much more efficient as well the 3 will come he’ll be best player n league
@SEVeNNyC Thanks and yup I’ve heard that as well
My prediction the Yankees will hit a lot of homers already have 10
@BryanHoch No length tho still impressive but need it thru 6-7 not not 5-6 or 4 n the case of Gray
@rileyreidx3 so I can’t get a follow Riley ??
Feels good to just be yaself - u already won if U stay true to u !!!
@swbrailriders Still waiting on the 18 roster
@ChasRiverDogs Waiting on that 18 roster
Half the battle of winning &amp; fixing yaself is taking responsibility for the part u played n moments that negatively define u - can’t play victim forever
@swbrailriders So r we gonna get a roster since  media day would imply I have a team to media
Thanks guys love ya !!!!! https://t.co/3BfnVRKgix
@rileyreidx3 follow me I wanna dm u
@leahmichellere1 But we made money what’s ya point meatball https://t.co/4QAW8UzzWe
@MarvinDeanbao35 Stop dick riding fam even worse look cock sucka
Lmao niggas stay blaming me for everything but I guess that was my fault as well - amazing
@TampaTarpons Sweet thank you
@realOconnor614 Indeed I am a prospect hugger which is why I prefer to use them in worthwhile deals &amp; until Gray he can go 6-7  with a sub 3.2 era with consistency I would’ve preferred to hug them guys a lil longer and got a worthwhile deal out of 3 top 💯 tho rehabbing kids
@DK973 If his first game wasn’t a continuation of the 13 he threw here last season u might actually have a point
@realOconnor614 I agree But cash has been enamored with Gray for a while now I would’ve sat on the package built a lil more stock n minorsadded frazier or adams  and used it for Hamels at trade deadline
Yeah I agree just wanna temper all he accolades til he’s actually done something &amp; yesterdays  game didn’t overwhelm me - we shall c I mean it was the As right
Not as bad as Kapler but still a very bad weekend for Boone from Betances 2 innings - not playing Austin after a 2 HR game - walking Donaldson in favor of pitching to Smoake -?going with Holder in that spot  the list goes on bad weekend my guy just bad
@BryanHoch Overall not as bad as Kapler but still a very bad weekend for Boone from Betances 2 innings - not playing Austin after a 2 HR game - walking Donaldson in favor of pitching to Smoake &amp; going with Holder in that spot  the list goes on bad weekend my guy just bad
@MissRaquel4X Recently moved to Miami would love to have a drink 🥃
Opening day postponed for snow n NY !!! I wonder if they r skipping Montgomery &amp; Severino gets the ball or giving everyone an extra day of rest @AndrewMarchand
@SdotKdot756 If u think Trey Burke hasn’t earned a spot for next season &amp;!shouldn’t  be given the reigns u don’t know hoops - pick would be much better served with a 3&amp;D 3 man then yet another PG added to the stable Burke is balling u still have - glutton if 1s need a true 3
I guarantee if u masturbate first u won’t make that trip !!!
@swbrailriders  when r y’all gonna release the rosters and rotation - don’t u open up this week
@TampaTarpons   when r y’all gonna release the rosters and rotation - don’t u open up this week
@TrentonThunder  when r y’all gonna release the rosters and rotation - don’t u open up this week
Othani pitches 6 and gives up 3 runs to the As &amp; y’all acting like he complete  Game shutout the Astros with 10ks - I mean really r we bragging about 4.5 era vs the double As ??
3-1 &amp; 2-2 so much different 178 to go smh already dont like the Boone  hire very questionable moves thru series  one
Judge not hitting - Hicks hurt - McKinley hurt -Betances sucks - Robertson touched up  - kahnle touched up  - gray can’t get past 4 -just the first series of the season ladies and gents
Ummmm Girardi anyone not as nasty as Kaylee n Philly but def questionable mjved by yankees new manager 2 days n a row
@realOconnor614 Nope archer - Fullmer - tearhen - or anyone else packaged with them guys hell of u add Frazier &amp; adams to what they sent u coulda gotten anyone
@realOconnor614 Might wanna pick another day to defend Gray - 89 pitches 10 baserunners thru 4 not acceptable i will give u 8ks &amp; 1 earned run but ummm still not acceptable the bullpen has to get 5 Easter innings
Ummm coulda used that prospect package for another pitcher that’s how - as he’s relieved here n the 4th with a man on 1st no outs
Fact is Yankees will regret the Sonny Gray Trade , I already do !!! Mateo , KAP &amp; Fowler for a guy who can’t get u out the 4th inning fucking ridiculous
Yankee prospect predictions   Torres starting n majors by all star break   Andujar plays well on both sides of the ball while with injuries n abundance   Adams no love   German 6th started pitches well  Cessa 7th starter   Medina &amp; Perez top 100 midseason
@BryanHoch @MAndujarPapa Guess the Yankees aren’t worried bout that extra year and setting that clock back after all
Well I blame Bone head Boone for bringing him back for a 2nd inning shoulda been in Robertsons hands
Def blew this game for the Yankees all Betances nobody else
I’m a fan but Betances has been killing the Yankees since last all star break  can’t continue on
@Babyice4k No just wondering who the fools across the room with the security guards are
@Joelsherman1 Was def gonna tell u the person who bet in Austin lost
Betances killing me right now 2 games 2 HR common bro
@atTheTrack7 @Joelsherman1 &amp; Andujar both need time n 3A to turn them clocks back
@JoshRogers13 Where r u headed ??
PSA if nobody knows who u r but asks who u r because u have Security u don’t need Security !!!
@AndrewMarchand It’s terrible he shoulda backed down and spared everyone that horrible call - but guessing if we only have to hear it after a homer it’s tolerable
@BigNick__GLOE Facts and I love it
@JackCurryYES @dcone36 Good now he can leave that FB on the shelf cuz that ain’t it !!!
@TorresGleyber @Topsheff42 Good shit ride for ya boys
My bad Drury !! Ok I c u !!!
For some reason the Yankees having  Drury @ third doesn’t have the same ring as Andujar on the lineup card - it feels like Drury is a weak link when u c the lineup card u get excited seeing Andujar &amp; Torres not that same energy seeing Drury , wade or Walker
@mamajeweldollaz Think about Biz all the time I miss him 2
Damn is Hicks hurt already shit 1 Game in ???? I guess the  Stanton n LF starts immediately &amp; YanKees could all of a sudden use one of the 2 injured players Frazier or Ells
@IamGabiVictor ✋🏾🤷🏾‍♂️🙏🏾🤚 👶🏽👶🏽🤰🤰
@CatTonic1 @KellyCa33165623 They prob don’t have jobs and live off the land

@JonHeyman When they go high we go Giancaaaaarlo stantonian blast for Giancarlo Stanton
@BryanHoch @LucaCesaretti It was terrible but if I get to hear it 60 or so more times it’ll still make me happy
Sterlings home run call for Stanton is a huge NO for me dawg common u had all winter and that’s what u come up what does Stanton have to do with Italy anyway
Suits -Empire &amp; Star tonight pretty good TV welcome back Wed nights !!!

@JeffMYoung85 Heisman vs 2 trips to NFC championship game and prob bowl hhmmm think ya thinking is a bit off
Today’s question does Gelo Ball get drafted ? Please remember the NBA only has 2 rounds not 700 like baseball &amp; football !!!! Is he a top 60 player n the world  ????
KAP is much better more accomplished  Manziel is the definition of white privilege &amp; that’s not to say he doesn’t deserve another chance Ima a fan I love Johnny football buuuuut   if he gets a job before KAP that’s crazy
@JonathanMayo hearing Acuna turned down 30 million but didn’t specify years and my questions is why wouldn’t he take that deal and buy out early years and still be able to killem w/free-agency
Not even mad at this I expected it with one exception the ridiculous black womam looking dumb as hell in this interview absolute token idiot https://t.co/IE5hPvCoRL
@MissRaquel4X 😍
@JonathanMayo  looking at fanagraph who the hell is Ezikiel Duran is he on the breakout player watch someone I need to familiarize myself with 14th prospect n the org or e they losing it ??
@UncleWillySon No I didn’t r u sure ?? Lemme check this out
Wonder if bird played this spring with injury &amp; made it worse trying to prove a point either way if he’s 💯  pct healthy 6-8 weeks isn’t end of the world -def beats alternative &amp; he can still hit 25 bombs coming back n mid 2 late May
U should never worrry about complimenting someone but the problem it that person will use that compliment and it’s context against u later to suit the agenda - attention whoring at its finest
@bsmeazy Im thinking Rutgers after Wenzel or the hall after Pj
Has everyone Watched 60 minutes ?? The question of the day is how do you feel about your president  now - opinions I wanna hear them all !!!
Congrats 2 my homie Danny Hurley on getting the UConn job and of course Bobby is @ Arizona State wonder if Bob Sr took the big job where it would’ve been ???

@JustJadaBee Agreed
people r feeling sorry 4 Melania Trump , he’s cheated 💯 of times she knew what she had this isn’t new .... common knowledge what we r seeing is a movie she’s been watching since day 1 - only difference hoes b fucking for bags shoes &amp; an occasional trip she’s the First Lady
Classic moment we miss u Luther https://t.co/SHUUkwix86
@EliteSportsNY German could be a 3-4 starter if given chance
@bsmeazy German is a competent if not over qualified 6th starter we don’t need a 6th starter didn’t wanna spend the money - German - Cessa - Sheffield by July - Adams by July Abreau next season - Tate soon after we ok
If mofos spent the time working on the actual craft instead of spending time promoting bullshit they would actually be able to b what the say they r !!!! A few pics don’t make u a model nor does a studio session make u an artist
Glad the Yankees look like they r valuing the contributions of Domingo German I’ve said he’s gonna be good - I’d prefer he go to Scranton &amp; stay stretched out biding time waiting for his shot @ the  start let Cessa have that 13th spot &amp; become a  permanent reliever
@TVbytheNumbers y’all really hate Monday nights never have cable ratings for Monday night is this a conspiracy
I’m Thinking I better win something big 🏆 🎖 https://t.co/afoonfwsd9
@mamajeweldollaz I better win the big award
@thelivest_ @BEEN_went_KrAzY If she does that’s a definite way to not get what she wants
1 week 1 day my Yankee fans let’s go Bombers !!!!!!
@Yankees Absolutely one of the worse commercials ever so bad it’s actually good - we bring the heeeeaaaaat
Yankees should be much better this 1st Half remember last season Didi missed month - Sanchize missed month - no Robertson - no Kahnle - bad 🦅 then injured 🦅 - no Stanton now over a film season it equals out Castro went down second half - Hicks and Judge was hurt
@VH1 @LoveHipHopVH1 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️
Facts on ya side the pound the facts   Truth on ya side the pound the truth   Neither on there side they pound the table
So the price of good box is a pair of shoes damn I gotta stop being cheap

@JackCurryYES @dcone36 Really nugget stolen from cone I been saying this for at least 12 months
@ByJasonFoster He went he’s wack didn’t steal shit Correa - Beltran stole show  said hell with president
@verosoze Yankees right about  💯
Kinda disappointed more Astros didn’t decline the whitehouse visit so many Latin Americans &amp; really no excuse to be there with a man who shits on u publicly and with actions just my opinion I’m entitled Correa &amp; Beltran I c u !!!!
@AndrewMarchand  so lemme get this straight correct me if I’m wrong the twins giving up draft pick ,intl bonus money &amp; 12 milli for 1 year of Lynn
On another note “ Scandal “ is getting good very very good last season thus far !!!!!!
These baseball free agents r getting fucked severely fucked with no vaseline wooooow only football guys get it worse nothing guaranteed but signing bonus !!!!
Congrats thisbis gonna be good https://t.co/qMfo8sQOd4
@JGraie Wooow yes
@JGraie Where when was this
I concur my friend but I need 4 https://t.co/1jYK5Ybz0Z
@JonHeyman Woooow he’s worth bout 40xs that
@bsmeazy German ready now  Acevedo &amp; Sheffield will b by July and if Lynn or Cobb or even Arietta stay u signed past the point u don’t have to give up anything but money then go for it
@bsmeazy Def not Lynn not with giving up draft pick and into money German will b just fine he’s better then Montgomery now
Yankee opening day lineup  Lf Gardy  RF Judge  1b Bird  DH Stanton  C Sanchize  Ss Didi  CF Hicks  3b should b andujar but it’ll prob b Drury  2b Wade but soon Torres    Severino  Tanaka  Gray  CC  Montgomery
I’m telling y’all German is gonna beat out Cessa for the 6th starter and then coming for Montgomery as season progresses save this tweet Yankee Baseball
@keithlaw when olivares signs with Texas today where will he rank in ya top 💯
@JonathanMayo when Olivares signs with a Texas today where will he fall in ya top 💯 prospect list
Don’t mess with Stanton let him rock n right keep it simple he’s here to mash not for confusion let judge move over in a pinch stanton judge rotate right &amp; dh Gardner judge rotate lf and that’s that
Be u be unapologetic for being u - can’t be anyone else they’re taken !!!!
@MariahLynBoss Killem quietly !!!
@AndrewMarchand Can’t deny Alex and his knowledge of the game definitely could would be an amazing coach scout or anything else
McKinney - Austin - Drury - Andujar 2  homer - Florial a triple scored on sac fly exciting times n Tampa man Florial is exciting German getting that 6th pitcher spit killing Cessa this summer - Shreveport lucky no more options of German would b long man
@MLBPipeline @Yankees Make that 2 today
2 2day
Andujar is putting on a show another homerun that makes 4 this spring Drury who shoulda kept the prospects we have the third baseman
@iamshayness Good thing I get lots of money not to give a fuck what u think 🤔 wipes forehead
@bsmeazy Florial prob starts season n high A or at most Double A would have to kill double A before AAA cuz then he’s knocking on mlb door gotta Get pitch recognition down - andujar is a 💎 I tried to tell ya -
So far spring training  takes   Florial is a very exciting player - Andujar looks like the real deal will be the 3rd basemen very soon if Not 2 start - wade looks good - Sanchez is a beast - Judge looks healthy - Stanton is n cruise control no pitcher has impressed
Social media lit   ✅  Final ep Ratings high  ✅  Reunion anticipation ✅  DVR recordings high ✅  Check cleared ✅   Season 9 coming ✅  Y’all will get over it ✅
@YESNetwork @AndrewMarchand So carry all the games now or at least all the ones MLB network isn’t airing I’m sure they wanna get in on the NY baseball fun
Confused how u can throw someone under the bus when it’s been the story line for the last 3 weeks - they been talking about her  showing dude the box on national tv since the trip how wasn’t that common knowledge at this point
@youlovesantana_ Don’t know u to feel a type of way but I believe n shooting ya shot don’t talk bout it be about it
@BryanHoch No issues w/ stretching him out and going back to bullpen stretched out
Yankees will regret Zach littell for Jaimie garcia real soon
@AndrewMarchand A rod hate is useless maybe get a life and get over it - trump is president Alex can manage
@the_truth_uncut Deny deny deny and look stupid stupid stupid have I not watched the three episodes previous get yaself together then @ me when u make some sense fuck u telling something that’s been on tv 3 weeks In A row
@IamGabiVictor Bla bla bla
@MLBNetwork @Yankees I tried and y’all cut the damn game off and put on top 1st basemen for the 50th time
@JackCurryYES did they really just cut the yankee game off mlb network the  bottom of the first inning - why would they black it out even though yes isn’t showing it how retarded
@BaseballAmerica Facts
@BleacherReport No what’s childish is he tried to hurt Russ lastnight  nobody is stupid watch the replay it’s obvious
@BryanHoch Draft pics &amp; international money why would they
@youlovesantana_ So stop playing and change that !!!
@bsmeazy Wanna c Drury play stil dont think he’s long term better then Miguel - he’s gonna mash 20- 80 type mash
@WorldWideTy2332 Frank good on D gives nothing on O Mudiae ok on D not much on O Burke is a potential 15 -6 type player in this uptempo system while also playing pressure D
2 quick points   1 why r the knicks trying to win   2 Trey Burke is the best Knick Pg
@Fyocca123 Gleyber is locked n @ 2nd regardless of machado who wants to play SS moving forward maybe Didi goes to 3rd arod style
Would’ve liked to c Andujar get the gig at third don’t really know Drury but a 25 yr old competing doesn’t sound like a stop gap - sucks a lil bit
@JackCurryYES Another bat with a lil power and high K rate smh and his D at 3rd isn’t that good either don’t get this unless he’s gonna be super utility by July
@Friziao81 Very possible but I’m thinking super utility starts season at 2nd while torres Get that time back then once he’s up I c a 2nd 3 rd rotation unless andujar stinks it up this spring then all bets off
Special election n KY went to the Dems kinda crazy considering Trump killed Hillary n that region - hopefully changing of guard not long before Dems control house and next year senate we hope
Lmao just peeped someone saying don’t judge chyna for giving bad neck on video cuz maybe she didn’t like him - so my question is this women u give head 2 dudes u don’t like I think shorty called it courtesy head - please advise asking for a friend
@lasa_g_na @1KingGohan Lol no shame in ya game “ courtesy head “
@JonathanMayo is Pablo Julio Martinez a top 💯 player - see he is allowed to sign can catch end of this signing period with Tx or wait til July for Yankees !!
@Buster_ESPN So u just refuse to let Andujar be great I c - fucking hater
@Friziao81 BRring something catastrophic we should b playing for it - houston - clev - boston only comp
@Friziao81 Andujar goes 280 with 20-23 homers 25 doubles no walks &amp; decent D / Tores goes 280 with 12-15 homers nice 350 OBP and solid D both will Get rookie of year votes
@Friziao81 Now the arm is already here German will surprise people as will Acevedo &amp; Adams with Sheffield ready by July / August save the money yanks r good
@Friziao81 Kids have no pressure none at all they r both top 💯 players one is top 10 and certified star written on him most teams would kill 2 Get him playing time we really trying to find reasons not to Didi range will help Miguel &amp; if u can’t turn double plays with him go home
@Friziao81 Any other team u have the 6 &amp; 55 or whatever prospect u break ya next to get him n the league look at recent teams but not the Yankees u don’t need all stars at every position 2 win Didi - Sanchez - Judge - Stanton all top 💯 players Bird - Gardy - Hicks all solid if not now when
@Friziao81 He’s super  athletic with pt &amp; confidence let’s c he might b another 280 350 25 HR 20 Sb guy he’s only 28 in his prime so time is now - just still believe Ells has a lot left
@JonathanMayo Lol u got me
@Friziao81 I’m waiting to c Hicks do it for a full season I like Hicks a lot but a full season please and Ellsbury is ahead of Frazier on depth chart Frazier h less he has a great spring training will prob start n Scranton
@CNN Can Democratic Party grab that seat like the rest of them or is this one set n stone republican
Never lose either win or learn !!
@JonathanMayo Was a question n a statement form trying to sneak and c if u said yes cuz that would mean they were n the top 4 systems !!!
@youlovesantana_ Be a real one @ her and post the video !!!
@JonathanMayo so I gotta wait til March 2/3 to see ya Yankees  top 30 list
People are really sleeping on Ellsbury just goes to show once the narrative is created nothing u can do - he isn’t a bad player just hasn’t lived up 2 price tag but def still a quality player when healthy 270 - 13-18 homers 350 obp &amp; 25 SBs
First day of camp for everyone in the big complex - I’m ready !!!! https://t.co/9obSHhl0De
How many of u when sifting thru social media say why am I following this person &amp; how did I even get here at all but don’t unfollow because they may notice ur gone
@Trapineze Like I said the president has awaken the sleeping racist they are out they r proud and they r comfortable - I think they have shown the comfort level since dude has been elected
Actually more respect 4 people that express how they feel publicly &amp; in n ya face - let’s not pretend &amp;  go home upset u were even n my presence - ok my diatribe is done all star Saturday all we do is play sports &amp; entertain let me basque n the glory
Shut *
People think just like her &amp; those r the people that r living n the glory of ya president - be very clear they exhist &amp; not just n Mississippi or Arkansas they live next door to u
Not saying it’s right just saying open ya eyes wake up and realize the world isn’t sweet &amp; roses lots of hatred lots of bigotry lots of prejudice &amp; that won’t change so pretending it has or we have overcome is just silly on your part
2days debate why is everyone so mad  bout “ shit up &amp; dribble “ if u think these things aren’t said everyday behind closed doors or with people with like thoughts ur crazy - difference is YOUR POTUS has mad it OK 2 express racism prejudice hate publicly its gets the base riled up
@kalebasch @hrbalaba @birdsnest427 @denniswilkins27 @BryanHoch Wade
@NYKen51 The bird emoji says I agree with u
Chad Green  99   Gardner 93   Didi 74   Chapman 65   Severino 43   Sanchez  26   Judge 15   Stanton 5   Prediction next season Didi top 50 - 🦅 enters - Sonny Gray back in - Betances back in !!!!
Lol facts !!! https://t.co/FAgay5CUMU
@TheSuiteforVIP Gray renters top 💯 player convo
@bsmeazy No joba rules they gonna stretch him out then he will b n middle relief starting the season - I don’t think we need another starter German gonna surprise Sheffield ready by mid season as will Adams ..... Cessa &amp; a couple warren 3 Green 3 bullpen games
@afwowner_qm14 Facts
17 families from 1 school n Florida r mourning children today if u think that’s ok because Said mass murderer was “ off “ &amp; nothing needs to be done about Gun reform because Said killer was “ off “ you’re clueless Babe Ruth never hit a home run w/o a bat

Smartest move of off season was Tanaka opting n his 22 milli a year for the next 3 def wasn’t getting more then darvish def wouldn’t be signed yet def would b looking at 15-17 a year - just a random thought as I heAd 2 Tampa for spring training
Monday new week new motivation - u gots ta get up get out &amp; get something !!!
@MichaelRapaport @NBA @spidadmitchell @utahjazz Dunno bout that Mike , Ben is balling at a super high level &amp; playing the 1 but I will say the knicks looking at this draft like how could we not have drafted this kid gonna hurt for May years 2 come

@__D__Savage Stupid bitch
@hazelebaby 👀🤔🤷🏽‍♂️👍🏽
@ToddKlindt @IamShaneMorris @Brian_Mahler Not even close to the same ridicule Cam got !!!!
@IamShaneMorris @redlabourer Well done well played thank u for keeping it 💯 cuz u didn’t have to
@pinstripealley Obviously they new the price tag and didn’t want him obvious they want Andujar to get a shot
@kporzee get well soon homie bigger better faster stronger next season !!!!!
Nothing but love  spread some
@MLBPipeline @MLB @jorgemateord @Athletics @JaneMLB Yankees will regret that Sonny Gray trade
@BryanHoch @LuisSeverino94 @45PedroMartinez That changeup gonna be a work of art !!!!
@BryanHoch Domingo German becomes the man this year a solid 3-4 better then Monty &amp; CC 10-5 with a 3.4 era
@BryanHoch @Yankees @MAndujarPapa Hope so means spring training went swimmingly
@bsmeazy @JackCurryYES 275-280 18-22 homers and will bat at bottom so more runs then rbis
@MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport Fucking hilarious u n the zone tonight
@BDubb2k12 Facts
@Jackiebel12 151 intelligence quotient prob separates me from u by about 95 percentile but with that said narrative remains the same
Fanagraph makes a lil more sense   12 Torres outside top 5 a lil low   14 Andujar a lil high but I like it    39 Sheffield will be higher at seasons end   59 Abreau good placement for him   79 Florial will be  much higher once he gets the swing &amp; miss together
@JonathanMayo Yup fanagraph has him for sure 14 kinda high but I insist he has a 280 - 25 homer bat and will play a serviceable 3rd - ops wont ever jump out cuz he on base comes only from hits no walks at all that’ll need to change
So baseball prospectus has come out with the top 101 &amp; ridiculously left Miguel Andujar off it Torres 3  - Florial 26 - Adams 51 - Sheffield 57  - Abreau 100 @JonathanMayo please speak to ya counterparts that’s a ridiculous omission
@jeffpaternostro @cdgoldstein @jaseidler Lol list lost a lot of respect if u don’t think Miguel Andujar is a top 💯 prospect just off the bat alone not To mention he isn’t a hack at third he’ll actually be average over there
Out of the 53 players on the Philadelphia 🦅 roster how many will decline the invite 2 the Dog House - I’m betting on a solid half
@MichaelRapaport Well this escalated quickly
Now that the Patriots lost Trump is like damn another team I will have to invite then uninvite after they decline !!!!
Congrats Eagles 🦅 well played !!!
@noemadnyc Def not bout to score now &amp; I still got them
@HeemieAhmeen Patriots as of now
The eagles will not b this years falcons
Even the Patriot come out music is Republican !!!
@Brandons51515 @HotStoveStats @asdnyy Only time you will ever win def not in wins losses soak it up
@TigersJUK @chrismott21 @HotStoveStats This countdown is based on one year shredder picks top 10 from season past
@demariojackson_ @Ivdown12 @HotStoveStats German is better then Montgomery hands down
@Ivdown12 @demariojackson_ @HotStoveStats G that’s N understatement if u can’t c that ur Stevie wonder
@HotStoveStats Severino had a better year verlander lost ya list credibility
All u ladies Don’t peek speak !!!
@TONYROCK Thank u Donald trump for all ya support over the years I never thought them disrespectful niggers should kneel either
@itskinkcity Got u where r u
@itskinkcity I got u - headed to oil aisle now
@rileyreidx3 Got u !!
U say u want respect but ur actions say u want attention -huge difference !!!!
The funny thing about social media is motherfuckas hating the most r the ones if You walked n a room would ask for a pic , post &amp; front like y’all best friends - the girls that talk with disdain yet the 1st ones asking what Hotel u @ I get it no offense taken
@IamGabiVictor Get focused
@MLBPipeline @MLB @JonathanMayo @11WillieCalhoun @brent_honeywell @_JorgeAlfaro11 @TorresGleyber @LewisBrinson @jp_crawford @MaxFried32 @willya02 Stars will align and you guys will obviously be surprised that Miguel Andujar will absolutely be n the top 3 save this tweet
@BIANCAisKING U aight
@Jcfletcher721 @JackCurryYES Over Shreve def think he can do that
Gonna sound crazy 2 some of u Yankees fans but given the opportunity I think German can beat out Montgomery for he 5th rotation spot &amp; wind up a solid 3 n near near future - trade wouldn lt look so bad after all @JackCurryYES
Trump literally lives n his own world last nights SOTU was not the most watched n history based on ratings maybe if u break down demo such  as Neonazis white  supremacist wtf etc but not overall - wasn’t even more watched then Obamas
@MLBPipeline Damn no Acevedo - Medina - Perez or Solak common now u gotta be kidding
@Aminabuddafly I’m n let’s do it
Most don’t believe n u they just stick around just n case - beware of the Half foot n half foot out syndrome
Women complain about dudes all day on social &amp; vice versa cuz they think they’re connecting with the gender base  but really the connection should be I got rid of him\ her found a new guy/ girl &amp;  we’re happy - giving so much energy is tainting the new energy IJS
@CNN Hilarious who did we help win not like they have a real democracy where people vote and lefties officials campaign
@ringer @S_C_ Shot chart def off Rocawear won big n it’s time sold for Over 200 million Samsung deal pcoeketed him 15-20 Mill if I can make 220 in my kisses sign me up
@Bigbdog75 Exactly but no defending trump he’s dividing the country and it’s by design
@bsmeazy And I’ve been saying for some time now Andujar isn’t a butcher at 3rd cannon arm good range just inconsistent but the bat plays expect 280 and 25 bombs is he plays every day won’t need to spend on Machado who wants to play SS anyway
@bsmeazy Def not signing a veteran to replace Gardy if they don’t pick up option &amp; Frazier is indeed gone then prob gonna move Judge 2 LF put Stanton N RF open up DH 4 Sanchize a lil more will still have Ells -Hicks - Stanton - Judge - McKinney if bank is broke 4 Bryce then all bets off
@bsmeazy Florial hits Double A this year &amp; will be ready at some point n 19 def not 2-3 years away was promoted 2 double A for the playoffs last season - prob starts there this season
@JonathanMayo What yankee prospects with strong seasons can appear on this list guys on the radar ??
@Bigbdog75 I disagree but whatever we all grown and have our opinions
@bsmeazy Hopefully not but I think so 2 Gardner gone next year jocks could falter need insurance with Florial right around the corner
If i cook food for the week &amp; leave u serve the food should u brag about how good u cook ?? I suppose u could if nobody knows I cooked but we all know Obama was the chef so stop taking credit for shit u didn’t do Donald not my president Gump
Clint Frazier got hosed only exceded the rookie eligibility by 4 @ bats has no role on team this year will prob start back n 3A &amp; woulda been top 30 prospect giving Yankees 7
all 5 major prospects traded away have made one list or another Mateo has rebounded on all lists Rutherford is free falling Guzman made 2 Fowler &amp; KAP have to get healthy but still made top 💯 lists
Yankee 💯 prospect 3 major rankings   (6 -5 -5 BA - Law -MILB )Gleyber  (38 - NR -44 -BA Law MILB) Florial (41-16 -48 BA - law milb) Sheffield  (59 - 54 -65 BA - Law milb)Andujar  (NR -73 -NR BA- Law milb ) Perez  (77-99 -74 - BA-Law-milb) Abreau  (81 - NR 75 BA - Law milb) Adams
@JonathanMayo were any of Guzman - Medina - Acevedo -Solak or Perez considered
MILB top 💯 with my previous predictions @JonathanMayo wooooow almost spot on   Adams - 75 predicted top 75  Abreau -74  predicted top 75  Andujar - 65  predicted top 50   Sheffield - 48 predicted top 50   Florial - 44 predicted top 35   Torres - 5 * predicted top 5
@susanslusser Have who back Mateo would never play n the OF as constructed 2nd is Torres 3rd Andujar SS Didi Fowler def blocked forever and KAP lets get a healthy season only thing maybe that package would get someone else
@Robfeliz I’m predicting both of them being rookie of the year candidates
@bsmeazy I anticipate he spending the whole year with big team torres starts in 3A so they can steal the year back
Indeed we do and no we won’t be
Strong 1st halves by Louis Medina - Frecier Perez -Domingo Acevedo - chance adams - Nick Solak means Yankees have 5 more unanimous top 100 guys with Perez already making Keith Laws ESPN list and coming in pretty high
Torres top 5   Florial top 35   Andujar top 50   Sheffield top 50   Abreau top 75   Adams top 75   Solak - Acevedo - Medina - Perez - Just outside 💯   My prediction becomes reality tomorrow  night @ 8 @JonathanMayo
So Law has Florial &amp; Acevedo just outside the 💯  Baseball America had Louis Medina just out the 💯  Which means Torres - Florial - Sheffield - Andujar- Abreau - Adams - Perez - Acevedo - Medina are all 💯 type players with Frazier just graduating    Things look Up yankee nation
@BleacherReport @MarkelleF @JCameratoNBCS Now if he could only make shots from 20 and in
@BNightengale Bring back Starlin !!!!
Strong Mind body soul equals unbreakable spirit https://t.co/zVqeiPNWDQ
No Florial n top 10 OF hmmm I’m guessing he’s just outside @JonathanMayo
2 killed 19 injured &amp; not a peep from dick head Donald I guess senseless white on white mass murders go quietly into the night - had shooter been black or brown it be a tweet shit storm
@bsmeazy Anyone is available n the right deal but they wouldn’t let him go for Cole that should tell u something about his status - and I think he can b rookie of the year his bat isn’t the question the glove is Yankees lineup he’ll see great pitches short porch good power 280 - 25
@Ken_Rosenthal So I’m guessing Mariano Rivera get 100 pct of the votes
@Buster_ESPN Fuck that racist asshole
@nytimes Making a big deal about this under oath shit as if he doesn’t believe his lie and really cares not telling them under oath
@verosoze Yes indeed I’m ready
Pre preseason predictions - if given chance to play everyday   Torres - bats 285 - 15 - 18 homers OPS over 750 great D @ 2nd   Andujar - bats 280 25 homers OPS over 800 - decent D @ 3rd
@BleacherReport Al the above
@BleacherReport Melo is gonna be a beast but y’all talking bout these games like he playing Rubio &amp; Porzingis the level of comp is equivalent to 15 and under AAU
@MLBPipeline @mi_guardado @AJCassavell @gregorMLB @wwchastain I’ll take Torres &amp; Acuna for the win
@yourfavoritenay That tongue eating ass licking balls and sucking sick all at the same damn time
@JonathanMayo let me know now if Florial isn’t in ya top 100 so I can officially take my dvr off record for Saturday night
@keithlaw really no Estevan Florial common Man ur kidding right ??

@JonathanMayo Looking forward I already have the DVR set to mlb channel I’m sure we r gonna have a lengthy debate bout some of these rankings
@keithlaw 👀 wow can’t wait for tomorrow 50-1 should be interesting
@keithlaw Hmmmmm Keith I see 3 already I replaced my Acevedo with Frecier why so high on him &amp; low in Abreau - Torres- Sheffield - Andujar and Adams still out n the atmosphere so it’s looking like 7 after all
@JonathanMayo Meant baseball America
@JonathanMayo wondering if you guys are as down on Blake Rutherford as https://t.co/PvkbqxfBRq completely out I c Mateo rebounded woulda been interesting with him @ second Fowler is def blocked now
top 6 yankees in exact order I had them last time we spoke think they stole my list 😂 far as Yankee trades Guzman top 50 by midseason for Stanton how can u complain  woulda been interesting with Mateo @ 2nd but  Fowler def now blocked
@jjcoop36 any Yankees just miss out on ya top 100 Solak - Acevedo Estrada - Perez
@BNightengale Hope u sing this tune when A Rod is eligible the best player ever
@BaseballAmerica's top 100 list 1 of many being released please refer to my previous tweet !!  #Yankees listed   SS Gleyber Torres (6),   OF Estevan Florial (38),   LHP Justus Sheffield (41),   3B Miguel Andujar (59),   RHP Albert Abreu (77),   RHP Chance Adams (81).
@Joelsherman1 Gonna miss Guzman I c Mateo shot back up no Blake Rutherford at all and Fowler still making noise regardless of injury but no Rutherford hmmmmm
@BettyBowers A,most as many people as the inauguration parade lol jokes
@baseballdad999 Hopefully he will be but won’t be popular enough off top to get the nod not even listed n top 10 first baseman
@youlovesantana_ Well stop playin games what u waiting on
This message is Creep squad approved !!!! https://t.co/Ev2IUEC3L2
@MichaelRapaport Facts say that shit again for the peanut gallery
Based on Sheer popularity Yankees  should have minimum 7 all stars   Sanchize C Judge RF / DH Stanton DH /RF Severino P  Didi SS *  Chapman - Betances - Robertson- Green pick 2 maybe all 4   Possible  Tanaka - Gardner - Hicks - kahnle
@baseballpro when does ya top 100 prospect list come out
@baseball_ref When does ya top 100 prospect list come out
@fangraphs when does your top 100 prospect list come out ??

@ConstanceJones Amazing
U gotta b kidding me right this is the leader of the free world https://t.co/1S4UJdGHVp
@RenaB0416 Did u google it tell the truth
@MLBPipeline @Ry_McMahon @PavinSmith @n_pratto @Ewhite_19 @b_bradley_44 @Matt_Thaiss @_ronaldguzman @MLBDraft When u do ya second base will I c Gleyber Torres or is he still still considered a SS until the season starts when he will clearly be a 2nd baseman or will he be both which means Yankees have 2 second baseman with Solak
@bsmeazy Tatum went 3 weren’t getting him regardless Smith they should’ve drafted Frazier is the true prize here tho
@BenBadler They gotta have a couple million left outta the 3.5 I know Salinas and Cabellos didn’t get 1.5 apiece
@TheLatifah Lol ya guy D
@KappaMan57 Definitely n Ga
Will the Cuban CF Julio Pablo Olivera b a top 100 player when he signs stateside ?? @keithlaw
@Yankeesfan290 @BenBadler Thinking between 8-12
@bsmeazy Lauri wouldn’t have excelled knocks have too many bigs as is and Dennis smith is gonna be good but Frazier is ridiculous already - smith still inconsistent Frazier borderline allstar
@giltoro22 Tatum &amp; the kid from the bulls I think they r happy with them pics maybe even the Lakers would do it again the same way
Screw everyone that was picked before 8 nothing u can do about that but the biggest mistake knicks made n Years was not picking Donavan Mitchell just another bad decision from the team the specializes n them
@_LoveOne2Manii No it doesn’t maybe u do push the unfollow button
I love joy just a lil bit https://t.co/o68cRSzx83
@JonathanMayo Ju@st realized last years #10rhp was the 34 prospect and although I love Albert that may be a lil aggressive for a preseason ranking from unranked into top 35 I. Thinking more like Top 75
@JonathanMayo @MLBNetwork How’s Abreau not on this list ??
@CNN Wouldn’t have hurt him his base woulda high fives him for bedding a woman they’ve prob only masturbated 2
@Maurice420 Started to block u for putting that image on my page
@SiirBrock Yes indeed my brotha
@Complex Wow first he’s touching kids now he’s a racist so basically a racist pedophile
In the immortal words of that rap group expreeeees yaself y’all know the rest !!!! https://t.co/I53Gh8xfP2
@MLBPipeline @MLB Albert Abreau
Get mooooney !!! https://t.co/MF4irIv8FF
@KZUNCH Silly them
If u walk like a 🦆 quack like a 🦆 then why pretend to b anything else ??
@CNN If it walks like a 🦆 quacks like a 🦆 then what do we call it a racist
@JonathanMayo @jschrimsher2 @JonathanMayo happy belated birthday !!!
@UberFacts And put it all together n the 40s
@DaveMayberry335 @YESNetwork McKinney should be top 20 if he played well this year could rise m mid season rankings
@youloveSannxo That’s code for dude just fucked and dipped off
@MLBPipeline @MLB @jimcallisMLB @Nationals @Phillies @jp_crawford @Mariners @tigers @Mets @Braves @Reds @Leodytaveras How does Estevan Florial draw Andru Jones comparisons and not be here when Dru was one of the best defensive CF ever
@darenw Point being what I’m watching 103 get turned around these days 96 isn’t what it used to be so stop harping on velo it’s def not aboutbthat anymore
@TaylorHing Taaaaaaaayyyyyloooooooorrrrrrrr
@AmbitiousDt Exactly u made my point don’t bring others into your mix if u still wanna fight for the last one
@HERSHEYKISS97 I agree then work on fixing that that’s my whole point
@BryanHoch @MLB Yankees r fine with the 5 if Montgomery falters we have German who I think is very underrated def can be as good or better also Adams / Acevedo n wings along with Cessa ! warren - green long / spot men with Sheffield ready by July Abreau by next July
If ya relationship is over let it b over why talk bout shit from months ago - what dude or female u know wants someone still talking bout the last person wether negatively or positive if ur done b done but seriously nobody cares to hear u obsess over some old shit
@MLBNetwork if Didi isn’t a top ten SS I’ve totally lost respect for the network &amp; these list won’t be paying much attention going forward
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal My hate comes as a byproduct of taking the Astros offer and not the Yankee offer lol
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal Ima yankee fan
@Ken_Rosenthal Inclined to believe Cole isn’t that good &amp; yankees package isn’t what was once thought &amp; everyone knows something we as fans don’t cuz otherwise Pittsburgh got hosed
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal Yup c u n game 7 for the pennant
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal We shall c still would’ve taken Estrada - warren - Cave from yankees over that package
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal 15 homers doesn’t profile n corners thus why he must improve routes to become legit cf or he isn’t a regular
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal Martin's hitting ability stands out more than his pop, as he works counts while using a compact left-handed swing to hit line drives to all fields. He does have at least average raw power and is starting to turn on more pitches, so he could become a 15-homer threat in the bigs
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal No arm takes bAd routes in center doesn’t hit w/ power to profile n corners as a regular but had good speed slap hitter too all fields decent player - doesn’t sound like a 5 tool guy to me
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal That didn’t get picked in rule 5 draft uh huh try again
@jjcoop36 So essentially Adam warren - Lou Cessa - Thairo Estrada - jake Cave or billy McKinney for that matter
@JonathanMayo so was that Astro pirate deal essentially Adam warren - jake Cave - Thairo Estrada &amp; louis Cessa got Cole
@AndrewMarchand the kids the Astros gave up would been equivalent to whom in Yankee organization
@BNightengale Get under the tax sign Didi  4 - 50 next season
@TalkinRangers @vincelara @Joelsherman1 Closer to 20 but who cares at this point  Let the kids play and c what we have the lineup doesn’t need help nobody has 9 280 - 25 homer guys &amp; 7 15 win pitchers it’s relative we should bash other teams 4-5 starter a guy with a 4 era prob wins 15 games here n ny
Rise and shine use the day to make yaself great again !!!!
@ABCPolitics What’s really disgusting is black people smiling n his face cuz he read a few a cards - just goes to show no matter who u r or what u stand for they will smile n ya face regardless - sorta like the Internet bash u behind ya back but let u show up it’s pics &amp; smiles 4 everyone
@HillaryClinton Fat ugly sloppy with a bad comb over
@realOconnor614 @JonathanMayo Yeah never been high on him Sheffield could be a 2-3 Abreau could be 2 Andujar is for me 280 with 25 bombs
WSJ reports that Trump's Lawyer Michael Cohen paid Porn Star Stormy Daniels $130K to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she had with Donald Trump. Y’all president out here trying to be n the creep squad
@jimcallisMLB team top 30 comes first then the top 💯 am I crazy orbdonwe see these Yankees in the list - torres - florial - Sheffield - Adams -Abreau - Andujar by midseason Acevedo
@JonathanMayo yankees top 10  1 Torres  2 Florial  3 Sheffield  4 Andujar  5 Abreau  6 Adams  7 Acevedo  8 Estrada  9 Perez  10 Solak    Andujar maybe shouldn’t be that high until D is proven but damn that  bat plays
@mizzyton Facts indeed
Blatantly vile racist comment over &amp; over again but yet they still ride For &amp; defend Just goes to show u no matter what it is if they wanna go justify his actions they will even when they can’t !! Shit hole President
Damn Donald every day it’s something new we can’t even stay focused on your last racist comment / action was because u h keepem coming so frequently
@jimcallisMLB did the Yankees just add more intl national money with the sonny gray trade - heard they chose intl money over the player to b named later option a is that new or was it part of the 3.5

@JonHeyman Would be very silly for yankees to give up the farm unless he agrees to an extension and they can trade Ellsbury - 1 he might not like NY and bout 2 would wasteall the work getting under 197 3 nothing is guaranteed in this world not even having Machado

@TheRealDarius33 @JackCurryYES And I’m very high on Miguel’s bat 280 - 25-25 is rookie of the year status if he can just play a serviceable third base which I think he can be not just serviceable but solid
@TheRealDarius33 @JackCurryYES Don’t want Cole he hasn’t pitched well but the 1 season been just about leaugue average or below the other seasons don’t wanna give up the farm for him - we have 5 starters give German - Adams a shot and wait for Sheffield , Acevedo and Abreau to b ready we will b fine
@Ken_Rosenthal @McCulloughTimes So will the hot stove ever be lit cuz this news is old cold pizza 🍕
Pre spring prediction if Yankees give kids a shot - Andujar hits 280 - 25 homers 25 doubles Torres wins rookie of the year &amp; German pitches to a 3.5 era with 13 wins he’s better then Montgomery @JackCurryYES
@CoachRedd Yup Jamal my guy still reaches out
@CoachRedd Ohhh shit u where did u have that pic stashed lol
@JonathanMayo and word on how much Yankees paid Sainas &amp; Cabello trying to gauge how much they have left for th Cuban our fielder or what they have planned with remainder of that 3.5

@TheRealDarius33 Just confused what ratchet television has to do with nuclear bombs - and FYI tv is indicative of the society shit is a problem of social media world don’t blame me teach ya kids to do better mine do

@jimcallisMLB is Blake Rutherford still a top 80 prospect I know his stock has fallen with 2 subpar seasons just tryin to c if he still has star written on him or was he overrated and the Yankees sold high
@SeyMoreeeee @Joelsherman1 2 n half a year a full year of Gary woulda beat fullmer for rookie of year
@JonHeyman Closer money will rise every year so What the Yankees paid it first next few seasons Miller will get that kinda money it’ll be the norm for bit time closers period not a bad contracts get over yaselves haters - and luxury tax is also rising so spare me

Merry Christmas 🎁🎄 enjoy ya day
@Aaronjh1019 He has gray esque stats and peripherals so the deal should look like that 2 severely injured and one with stick down but all have a lot of potential I do Frazier - adams and maybe koermer
@baseballdad999 No Florial - Sheffield - Andujar - Abreau - torres -  Estrada anyone else im cool
@CBlaisure What’s ya point did c that u made one
@HappyGilmore696 @sMaKDiddYbang Neither is 1 good one so rethink that position especially when Pittsburgh has the pitching whisperer Cole has been good once not CC who we thought was over not Tanaka 1 bad 1 over over his career and not Severino who was our basic point none of them cost us prospects
@sMaKDiddYbang U made my point why we giving up the. Farm for someone who hasn’t been good n going on 3 seasons - we don’t give up the farm n hopes he’s good again one day what kinda thought process is that
@Drawzilla U clearly aren’t a yankee fanatic if u think Gleyber coming up a full season of Gray a healthy Sanchez and Didi and Hicks and of course Stanton aren’t changes
Flirting is sexual harassment just depends on if she likes u a lil bit
“You all just got a lot richer,” Trump said to friends during dinner at Mar-a-Lago Friday night. He was talking about his tax scam he had just signed into law. What a shady grifter &amp; pathological liar.  Wonder who voted for this guy &amp; why ??

@keithlaw U don’t have to answer I guess I’m a prophet !!!!
@LindsayMontell And I would or should care that ur no longer one ???
Next President has the easiest job n the world just undo what Trump has done and it’ll be pretty easy considering Dems should have control of everything after there midterm elections - I think I might run solidify my legacy
@AndrewMarchand I like both Sheffield &amp; Abreau more then adams &amp; Monty but I’m sure the package isn’t gonna be Montgomery &amp; Adams for Cole thus having to give up Frazier  &amp; Andujar that is the mistake
@keithlaw what r the Yankees waiting on with this international bonus pool  $ why haven’t they signed Ronny Rojas weren’t they waiting for him to turn 16 &amp; have been forever linked to Salinas &amp; Cabello what’s the hold up with those 3
Yanks don’t need Garett Cole have 5 pitchers with enough minor league depth can’t have nor should want everybody - we built the farm let’s not start doing silly things cuz Cash wants new shiny toys -say no to Cole @AndrewMarchand

@Robbieblueeyez @JackCurryYES More like 120 - 125 but agreed that def gives some offensive leeway at third
@mikesilva53089 @JackCurryYES No hell no
@djheat42 @_SulimanB @JackCurryYES Cano wanted out nothing to do with money felt the Yankees treated Latin American players funny style
@JLmierz25 @JackCurryYES U make no sense a top 4 pitching staff arguably the best bullpen n baseball and a top 2 offense what more foundation do U need
@JLmierz25 @JackCurryYES Definitely not  hi 80s low 90s ur basically saying they r  the same team as last year &amp; that sounds nuts Stanton - kahnle - Robertson  - Gray -  bird Didi &amp; Sanchize all misssed a month with injury def a 95-100
If Yankees plan to go after Manny next season wouldn’t it make sense to give Andujar the keys this season  ?? see what u have what if he goes 280 with 25 homers then ucan get a lot for him in a trade or why even spend on Manny !!! @JackCurryYES
The power went out here n the ATL 4 hours, affecting  tens of thousands of people, leaving them stranded in the dark.   The power has been out n Puerto Rico 4 months, affecting millions of people, leaving them stranded in the dark. Many still have no lights. Reflect on that.🇵🇷

We know he won’t but wouldn’t it be nice if Trump resigned !!!!!
@Ming67521037 Dunno know bout Alabama being “ the south “ definitely in the south doesn’t set trends tho but u all should definitely be applauded for keeping Moore out of office that was a big deal
@vannity4 Facts scary times
Sexual harassment flood gates have been open for a minute not but this is getting a bit ridiculous I’m sure it’s been rampant for some time but damn I’m willing to bet him saying “ hey sweety “ didn’t cause u emotional distress
Last thing on Moore  since he lost anyway I would be remiss 2 not mention that The President of the United States openly endorsed &amp; campaigned for a racist bigot pedophile !!!! Just saying u elected this guy
@jimcallisMLB Looking for 6 yankees Torres - Florial - Sheffield - Abreau - Adams - Andujar
Thank u Alabama

Lotta things being said about Keaton I don’t advocate violence &amp; he shouldn’t b paying 4 his disgusting mothers actions with that said if true 60k for a sob story from a kid throwing around racial slurs wasn’t the answer either !!!! Case closed the end
@hitmann49 @Joelsherman1 Austin - Romine kids n 3A
@BryanHoch @MLBPipeline FYI Andujar would hit 275-280 with 20 homers n the league right now just an FYI

@BNightengale Judge being the better fielder &amp; LF have more ground in Yankee stadium wouldn’t it make sense to move Judge if anyone was 2 go
@dbrust1030 @drocktrot @VelVelHoller @bullyray5150 That has a racist bullying mother fuck this video why u even repost it
@Gladiator_BBall U act like the pitching was bad it wasn’t ever all season solid as a whole and only one spot n rotation can very well give that to a kid like chance adams - Domingo German - might wanna check them stats rotation was top 5
One thing bout the Internet it’ll give u the attention u desire just know as that comes u will then get the attention u didn’t - no hiding shit once u pop -people have time today
@JonathanMayo hated 2 lose Guzman think he absolutely has ace potential woulda shot thru the system and been top 100 bybyears end expect to c him ranked there shortly but that Said Devers will also be good but middle infield depth and young kids already n league he’s blocked
@JonHeyman I agree with tha marlins on this one as much as I’d like Guzman to be mediocre he’s actually pretty damn good and secondary stuff jumped  like hell last year expect him to jump into top 100 this year sits 98 tips out at 103 with improving secondary stuff
Wake up be amazing go 2 sleep wake up do it again !!!!!
@TMZ @HollywoodLife And these women r the gifts that keep on giving
Like this tweet save this tweet   Judge 40  Stanton 40 Sanchize 35  Bird 30  Didi 28  Andujar 15-20 ******  Gardy 20  Hicks 20   Trust me homers
@Matty_ice220 @TorresGleyber Gonna hold him back for free agent purposes and give the excuse he has only played a 30 or so games n 3A plus he coming off injury see ya @ all star break Gleyber
@KearaBrasi Yankee depth chart
Rotation   1 - Severino  2 - Tanaka  3 - Gray  4 - CC *  5 -Montgomery - Adams - German - Acevedo - Green * - Cessa - Cortes
C - Sanchize - Romine  1B - Bird - Headley -Austin- Romine  2b - Toe - Wade  3b - Andujar - Headley - Toe -Wade  SS - Didi - Toe - Wade  LF - Gardy - Frazier -Hicks  CF -Hicks - Ells -Gardy  RF - Judge - Stanton - Hicks - Fraz  DH -Stanton -Judge - Sanchez
Here we go my GM skills - trade Headley give keys 2 3rd 2 Andujar only problem he bats righty Castro gone let Wade or Toe start @ second  -trade Frazier get a good picther or prospect his equal - still have 5 OF for 3 spots
@AndrewMarchand And now
@iamErica_Mena 🤚
@Mr_LightSkin31 I wish
@Dick_Harper Yes &amp; Yanks still n position to get under tax who could’ve thought that maybe a Headley trade or Ells even Gardy someone in the OF has to go literally have 2 many players with Frazier McKinney &amp; Cave sitting n 3A &amp; Florial prob starting n 2A
@BlacKardKD @Writer165 @jimcallisMLB @Marlins @Yankees He is better as is Abreau Adams and maybe even Acevedo but damn Guzman is a lottery ticket ceiling if ace floor of closer
@Writer165 @jimcallisMLB @Marlins @Yankees Wouldn’t have been mad @ Tate and both of last years pics
@JonHeyman Prob mad they did
@SamDykstraMiLB @MiLB And kept Acevedo &amp; Abreau the newest members well at least one will b of the top 100 but quite honestly Guzman will be a top 100 before long
@pinstripenyy People forget he’s only 28 not 30 something  &amp; Ellsbury is a speed first player not to mention ells hasn’t fallen off a cliff he’s never played up 2 contract from day 1 that’s his issue sonterrible comparison
@jimcallisMLB @Marlins @Yankees Guzman will be an ace and will breeze thru the farm system and be top 100 by mid season hate 2 c him go
@Mr_LightSkin31 Guzman was top ten will be a top 100 this year we did give up a prospect and devers will be good
@Dick_Harper Love the deal the average money will be less then what they were gonna spend on Manny or Bryce didn’t wanna c Guzman go he’s gonna be really good gonna be n hi A this year
@SamDykstraMiLB @MiLB He’s gonna be really good shoulda gave up someone else not him yankees had all the leverage Devers I’m cool with all things considered
@BenBadler Don’t wanna c Guzman go potential ace people don’t know that maybe a lil older for the league he was n but his secondary stuff took huge steps woulda been n Tampa at some point this season
@JamezSagardia @Ken_Rosenthal Why do they need too Hicks n center Gardy n left Ells backing up center Hicks backing up left Gardy backing up center Frazier plays left cave plays all 3
@Ken_Rosenthal Don’t care bout how much they took what’s the average salary in the books gotta be roughly 22 not so bad much less then Harper or Manny woulda cost
@Buster_ESPN @jaysonst Starlin was part of the trade
@Buster_ESPN @jaysonst Take out Headley out n Andujar
@TheBrooklynLife He can go where does he even play now gotta be Scranton cuz Hicks Judge Gardy Ells and Stanton is waaaaay to many outfielders to carry including Clint plays Florial will be up soon
@Dick_Harper Not mad at that 24 million gone 25 million coming n can still sign CC
@Mr_LightSkin31 Love it if it’s taking on money and no major prospects r lost
@SirMott87 He can go was never high on him
@JackCurryYES Noooooo he’s on the verge of being a ⭐️ why would they get anyone in the top 10 &amp; only putting up 35milli that’s not cool at all common jack Cashmans knows better they have all the leverage
@JonHeyman Only 35 mill better not be any prospects I like I’m talking tier 2-3 guys
@Feinsand Opting out of 200 plus n ya twilight years seems nuts he’ll be 31 n 20 what team gonna give him 200+ going into that age
Taking on that amount of money the Yankees better not be giving up any A list prospects like seriously no Medina Martinez or Guzman none of them at 25 a year now they must get rid of Gardy Headley or hopefully Ells
If ass don’t match legs transfer that fat 2 thighs &amp; calves
@TheGreatWhite Could live with that
@HolyCowRizzuto @JonHeyman Crazy no way
@JonHeyman No prospects if they taking that money - Ells - Gardy - headley
@JonHeyman Hmmmm that’s a pretty big market out there 2 so much for small market and chances to win r theyvreally gonna beat houston with or w/o him
@jjcoop36 lol I bet
@TheRealDarius33 Lesser of evils  my friend until the alternative come front center lesser of Evils
@KenDavidoff @KevinParrishJr Not too mention the fake Adam warren shot green will get Mitchell and Cessa still around Cortes if he’s not plucked koermer deserves a shot
@KenDavidoff @KevinParrishJr All they need is CC how long are adams &amp; Acevedo gonna sit n 3A without a fair shot - German proved he’s a legit and Sheffield - Abreau - Guzman - Perez - Medina &amp; Martinez coming up quickly
@Teh_Real_LoCo @pinstripealley No keep Florial keep Abreau headley plays third until andujar is ready torres starts n 3a gets reps gets healthy til all star break - machado won’t sign with anyone so nobody is gonna sign him he wants free agency so he will get it it’ll only cost money and the draft pick
@jimcallisMLB @whitesox @Braves @Padres Braves took a huge hit u still have them top 5 after losing all them players ??
@Buster_ESPN Pretty damn nice lineup
@Teh_Real_LoCo @pinstripealley Dumb ass fuck give up Half ya farm for a guy that’s about to be a free agent In the following offseason
@MelissaAOlcott Lol thank u
Republicans: The party that fought tooth &amp; nail to stop gay marriage on the basis that it would lead to pedophilia, are now fighting tooth &amp; nail to elect a pedophile into Congress.
@CNN She’s suck a fuckig idiot she Disgusts me even looking at her do Interviews  and hearing a repulsive annoying ass voice
Very good Atl very good job congrats Keesh !!!
Freedom is what u do with what’s been done 2 u !!! Think bout that for a second
I think turtle necks r back see them n all the magazines
@AlexVandengo @jjcoop36 Solak - Estrada - w garcia - d garcia - torres - t wade - Park all 22 &amp; younger
@BenBadler I imagine if u bought a Mercedes G wagon and later found out Benz cheated on the lease application so they gave u the car and Said u now own it as punishment to Mercedes that would be a pretty happy day
@JonathanMayo question of the day is Thairo Estrada gonna be a better option then Wade - Torreyes -&amp; Solak at Any infield positions 2nd short or 3rd
@jimcallisMLB top 💯 yanks  torres top 5  Florial top 50 Sheffield top 50  Adams top 50  Andujar top 70 Abreau top 90  Acevedo -Solak - Guzman - Estrada top 150   Am I spot on ?....
I understand the hustle I promise I do but if I want a dance i promise I know how 2 beckon u - ya ass on my knee isn’t gonna make the Dollaz rain / no pun intended
Hope u enjoyed the Richie D experience c ya next Monday 8pm sharp - Mr Monday night signing off
@properlyput Blessed
Ima start unfollowing fake motherfuckas on social media the level of fake shit is reaching epidemic proportions so if u look up and I’m gone u know ya fakeness can no longer be tolerated
So lemme get this Liangelo Ball gets caught shop lifting abroad suspended indefinitely from UCLA pop decides to take him outta school get him ready for the league maybe Japanese league but league none the less and give him a signature shoe - gotta love it
@jjcoop36 Hoping this year it all comes together for him secondary pitches showed much improvement and promise last season could shoot up rankings if he slightly puts it together
@BenBadler I c Thairo &amp; Medina made huge jumps don’t necessarily agree with the latter unless your going strictly based on potential
@BenBadler Latter
@Benito2325 @BaseballAmerica Doubt that very seriously Unless maybe accuracy decided this one
Just realized Prince Henrys fiancé is shorty from Suits guessing Mike Ross can’t compete with the Prince lol
@Joelsherman1 At least Texas makes a lil sense maybe warmer weather even tho DALLAS /Arlington is not a small market but chicago makes absolutely no sense
@AndrewMarchand And Salinas and Marte so having that money wont be a total waste
@JonathanMayo bummed out by not signing Othani but they will prob get Marte &amp; Salinas and Maithan from the Braves
@jimcallisMLB how far do u c Blake Rutherford falling after another dissapointing season out the top 50 I’d imagine and also has Albert Abreau hit the top 100
@newkingofmedia @BaseballAmerica @BobbyMilone29 Depending on if they sign Othani or maithan both would b top 10
@newkingofmedia @BaseballAmerica @BobbyMilone29 Ummm def not Estrada Tate or McKinney goes torres -Florial  -Sheffield - adams - Abreau - andujar - Acevedo - Guzman - solak - Perez with Tate - Thairo n top 15 McKinney cracks top 20
Trump is really fucking America up I hope everyone that voted for his is happy with themselves do we really can we at this point really think Hillary would be worse ?
Live ya best life fuck everyone else !!!
@RealMichaelKay @AndrewMarchand @AaronBoone_ESPN Amazing story great guy but we need 97 wins and a World Series trophy how does that help
@KenDavidoff @Joelsherman1 Prob 1 million a year
@jcrasnick @JacksonHeil And part of the process was make sure u answer that clubhouse phone when we have in game instructions facts
@MLBPipeline @Indians @MLBastian Slim 2 none
Frank is cool but Donavan Mitchell What the knicks needed !!!!
@MLBPipeline @MLB Does he become a top 100 prospect as well
@iamErica_Mena 😍
@jimcallisMLB early prediction - Torres top 5  Florial top 50  Adams top 50  Sheffield top 60  Andujar top 75  Abreau top 100  Acevedo peripheral  Solak good season n  promotion 2 3A away Guzman 1 big season away from top 100
@MLBPipeline But neither n top 100 lol justvgoes to show how weak the system is
Supporting the new tax bill is blasphemous can’t believe Senate is even considering this - can we hurry and take control of the house &amp; Senate
@GangstaBooQOM Mtown what up !!
Hello how r u   Hello beautiful have a great day   5 minutes later excuse me sir Human Resources needs to c u   Sir we have to let u go ##  Ummm yup that’s about right in this moment

@Zel2111 @WilderLanier Facts I’m headed to HR office now
&amp; they said the Creep Squad was bad
@StillPrecious1 Isn’t that even worse men loosing jobs over personal issues needs to be check n balances system in place
Matt Lauer lost his job. Charlie Rose lost his job. Mark Halperin lost his job. Glenn Thrush lost his job. Billy Bush lost his job.  Harvey Weinstein lost his job. Kevin Spacey lost his job. But in politics... Conyers still in Congress. Moore still running. Trump still President.
Wooooow now matt lauer smh these sexual indiscretions r reaching   epidemic  proportions
@CNN And the tax plan has left them further behind silly them for thinking trump would give them a chance fucking idiot
@NanasiaMusic Facts
Question of the day is Senate gonna allow this tax reform bill 2 go thru - it’s actually kind of disgusting they would do people like that
@keithlaw Shoulda thought about that when the new CBA was done he cares cuz it’s his commission his client
@iamErica_Mena 👀
@Pacman072286 @JonHeyman Yanks have DH
@JonHeyman Yankees forgone conclusion money - endorsements - large Asian population - good young team - success with Japanese players - spotlight - Dh - bring cc back 6 man rotation
@jimcallisMLB @MLBDraft As long as torres - Florial - adams - Sheffield - Andujar &amp; Abreau and possibly Acevedo then all is well n baseball land
@jimcallisMLB why do I feel like Miguel Andujar isn’t getting proper attention everyone is waiting on Gleyber &amp; 4 good reason but Miguel is gonna be somewhere hitting 285 with 25 homers playing decent 3rd base
@jungela Mine 2
@briasoboojie Bitch please what the biz she’s not nothing to me what’s the biz idiot watch the show
ME Monday night is back !!!! https://t.co/TNDNbSZtHf
So if yankees sign Othani do they then become #1 farm system with the #1 player even though he won’t play a game n minors @keithlaw
Indeed we should top notch 3A rotation and don’t forget Abreau maybe by mid season  exciting times n Scranton
Jack - Lee - niki - Dotson - Hardaway - all higher on 1-2 position depth chart then baker &amp; session
Ron baker n G league &amp; Ramon session deep on bench pull n 10 milli per year between them coulda found better way to spend that 💵 💴 💰
Outfield glut as well Ells - Hicks - Gardy - Judge - Frazier - McKinney &amp; Cave coming with Florial tight behind them
U thought yankee rotation is full infield just as bad Sanchez - 🦅 - Castro - didi then u have headley &amp; Andujar with torres coming Wade battling Toe with thairo coming
Triple A rotation will be beast Acevedo - Sheffield - Adams - Cessa - German maybe even Montgomery
Yanks coming 2 camp with loads of pitchers who will 5 b Severino - Tanaka - Gray - Montgomery - German - Green - Adams - Cessa - Mitchell ( CC - Othani ) 2 full rotations worth of guys looking 4 innings
Damn can March get here spring training already
@RealSkipBayless A w is a w whats ya point
@Rosenbergradio @drocktrot We referring 2 a dis track or careers cuz either or I need answers
So last year Time magazine called me &amp; told me I’d prob b man of the year but I didn’t wanna do the interview or the photo shoot so I passed thanks anyway guys
@stengel Guess that’s put his fake time cover n perspective
This year biggest jump in Yankees prospect ranking will be johnny lasagna or Louis Medina I’m betting in big years from both
Yankee have lots of top 💯 talent  Torres - Florial - adams - Sheffield - andujar - Abreau - Acevedo maybe - Guzman shortly - solak maybe - Perez eventually -
Porzongis is the star but kanter is why they r winning ?
@SimpnMild @XxxStylez Wonder if he goes 2 jail if he doesn’t pay his child support
@GangstaBooQOM Tellem Boo M- town
@SamanthaHyatt @youloveSannxo I’m waiting
Yankees 18 top 100 prospects   Othani  Torres  Florial  Sheffield Abreau  Andujar  Adams  Acevedo
@JonathanMayo Obviously gonna be number 1 and with that the Yankees will have 2 top 5 prospects
@iamErica_Mena Shaderoom sweety it’s there for everyone 2 c
The face when u pick up that full length shearling  from danielsleather about KUT the homie… https://t.co/PNVS23fKDY
@TMZ Nobody gives a fuck bout Herschel walker country Uncle Tom ass opinions didn’t he play for trump n the USFL vision clouded
So othani gets 4 milli his former team gets 20 sounds bout right
@iamErica_Mena @natyisabelxo Raises hand 🤚
@Feinsand So now he will cost 200 million again
Yankee top 10 prospects   Torres - Florial - Andujar - Sheffield Abreau - adams - Acevedo - Guzman - Solak - Perez
@Chris_Broussard Still trash relax my ass
@keithlaw Yes  that damn auto  correct Jonathan Loaisiga
@JonathanMayo 1 has Abreau jumped Acevedo in prospect ranking 2 was Jonny Lasagna worth the roster spot &amp; 3 why r Shreve &amp; Mitchell still here ??
@keithlaw 1 has Abreau jumped Acevedo in prospect ranking 2 was Jonny Lasagna worth the roster spot &amp; 3 why r Shreve &amp; Mitchell still here ??
@jimcallisMLB 1 has Abreau jumped Acevedo in prospect ranking 2 was Jonny Lasagna worth the roster spot &amp; 3 why r Shreve &amp; Mitchell still here ??
@BleacherReport Lies bloggers tell Ben simmons hands down not even close
@Chris_Broussard He’s trash
Taylor Swift sold 1.2 million n the first week so before we forget just understandthat’s not streaming or click machine that’s actual sales
Yeah it’s pretty bad my apologies !!
@BjTheSocialite Home
Enisha kanter might b the best center n the east
Obviously this new IFA money is for Othani but the yanks r linked 2 a couple more Latin American kids dunno exactly where from 2 top 15 prospects sonifbhe doesn’t come expect it 2 b spend quickly anyhow
@JonathanMayo who will yankees loose &amp; add 2day common bro need answers before 8 I say shreve - smith &amp; maybe Mitchell go thairo - McKinney - Abreau - torres - Acevedo get added
Lotta deals will be struck today with the rule 5 thing going down tonight Yanks already made 2 trades expect bout 11 more
@Feinsand Who the hell is that San Martin
@emilysinclaire_ @_WHITBITT Raises hand 🤚
Alabama is a fucking mess as usual... let’s keep it 💯...   * Ranked 47th in education * Ranked 48th for highest poverty rate * Confederate flags every where * Roy Moore * Top 5 for most hate groups in the US * 62% of the State voted for Trump  Just dumb as shit! Yikes

@lLOVEDAYAMI 😍
Rise shine give God the glory
@pinstripealley Cool article until u neglected to mention Hicks so even  with a Gardy or Ells trade he’d still be 5th &amp; prob 6 behind McKinney
@JonathanMayo rule 5 coming up what Yanks  gonna loose roster spots Cessa - Gallegos -Herrera - Mitchell - Shreve - Austin - Cooper - Smith
Let’s get it https://t.co/7HyNwevWsR

Knicks trying 2 b faster &amp; get rid of the gluttton of 5s how does a Jalil Okafor help that ? Would b a dumb move besides Kanter is ballin !!
@Mumble1 Of course
Never forget the only thing phil Jackson did right n NY (KP) was only because Jalil Okafor was taken
@CNN Possible trump will use this as an I told u so moment
@CNN Good save him so U can kill him the right way
@jimcallisMLB @MLBazFallLeague Florial - Acuna - Robles then end
Had 2 check on my pops he’s the AD @ BMCC right across the street from all the madness n NYC - walks that bike path everyday crazy 🙏🏾 out
“The two bst longterm prospects in the Arizona Fall League are Ronald Acuna(OF, Braves) and Estevan Florial(OF, Yankees)" per Peter Gannon’s
@DidiGoatorious @Steve_Milla @pgammo Yanks wondering where 2 play Andujar Torres - Estrada - Wade &amp; Toe What were they gonna do with Mateo although I lived him just no room
@DidiGoatorious @Steve_Milla @pgammo KAP is never healthy where does Fowler fall n yankees OF Judge - Hicks - Frazier  - Florial - Gardy - Ells -McKinney
@bigyankeefan420 @pgammo 2 years whose not around Gardy contract expires so we know he’ll be gone still have Hicks - Frazier - Judge - Ells - McKinney
I guess everyone is seeing now how rampant the casting couch really was now Jeremy Piven &amp; Kev Spacey caught up more 2 come

@jimcallisMLB what would the AZFL be considered In terms of competition level I know it’s hitter friendly but what level 2A ??
@JonathanMayo Gotcha well Thairo &amp; Sheffield will be cooking final vote for McKinney - Florial theyll prob split the vote &amp; other dude will win
@MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport Fucking classic
@_DGotGame_ Think ur right it’ll go 7
@JonathanMayo How is Abreau not n the AZFL all star Game is it that political that he will actually have won player of the week &amp; still not make all star
The President &amp; his team r nuts never seen anything like this remember we aren’t even a full year in !!!
@TByse Congrats god is good
So if Astros win tomorrow we will know if Tanaka opts out by Friday if not early next week - the game within th Game yankee fans

@keithlaw Torres - adams - Florial - Andujar - Sheffield - Abreau - Acevedo NY 100 prospects 2 start 18 Sauer -Guzman - Solak just outiside
@JonathanMayo Torres - adams - Florial - Andujar - Sheffield - Abreau - Acevedo top 100 prospects 2 start 18 Guzman - Solak right outside
@Tiffanieromeyba Scripted *
@Tiffanieromeyba Notransition here I was always cocky and arrogant before tv scriptured or not
@JonathanMayo Andujar should get the spring training look at third frazier not coming back Headley could play 1st DH 3rd with Torres n 3A getting right

Just saw the dumbest thing ever someone proposed a Kyle Schwarber for Louis Severino deal yankees better not even think about it
@AndrewMarchand Wonder why

@TheGreatWhite He couldnt handle third base why the hell would they put him n charge of a team
@bennysportsfan @keithlaw Well ima need Benny 2 know Oppenheimer isn’t even n the Yankee org anymore but I get ya point I imagine
@AnthonyatMid @keithlaw Pay attention idiot pay roll will be bout 140 3 days after World Series
@keithlaw Maybe it was his decision not 2 come back
Girardi is a goner - couldn’t b BL happier at least until the next manager is worse
@Fyocca123 @JonathanMayo U know I ❤️ me some Florial but he gotta get them Ks down 2 25pct he’d be an all star perennial all ⭐️
@Fyocca123 @JonathanMayo Yes as is Thairo hitting better then both Florial &amp; Mckinney but all playing representative Sheffield pitching well but nobody like Abreau
@jimcallisMLB Albert Abreau killing AZFL is he gonna start season n ya top 💯 should b n double a 2 start season 2 runs 15 innings
World Series Is on BUT damn how bout that Abreau 2 runs n 15 innings of AZFL @JonathanMayo predicting he starts season in top 100 and n 2A

@_DGotGame_ Nope apparently not next year we do it again
@KingZito973 Who ??
CC dud Kahnle dud offense dud not the way to go out fuck it c ya n Feb when pitchers and catchers report
Channel changed
That’ll do it
@Fyocca123 If he beasts n spring training all bets off
Still feeling like Andujar is the third baseman of the Future
Every miscue by Castro is a step closer to the Gleyber era @ 2nd
@TheoSHK @JonHeyman Miguel
@JonHeyman Stop it
@KingZito973 And I take Sanchez bat over romine glove at that position everyday and 2wice on Sunday
@KingZito973 He’s fine Game caller common look at metrics only issue he has behind plate is blocking that scares him from callin some pitches
@Fyocca123 Hurt starting season n 3A only had a few triple A at bats if he’s balling midseason call up that means Andujar &amp; Castro better be ballin
@KingZito973 U crazy as hell if u think romine is starting behind the plate n a win or go home game Sanchize catches DH free up prob Headley
CC comes back -Tanaka opts out -T Frazier isn’t resigned -Gardy unfortunately is shopped -No takers for Ells contract Andujar takes over 3rd
Feeling good bout tonight’s yankee Game may wanna watch alone tho if it goes left I might loose my mind - common CC
Ok Dellin thank u
@_DGotGame_ Well b there
@_DGotGame_ C ya next week
I want Betances
Case and point
If they called high strikes on Altuve like they call low ones on Judge he wouldn’t hit 800 that I can guarantee
My bad &amp; Sheffield is n Az as well not 2 mention Solak - Perez - Guzman - Heller  r on peripheral waiting on a chance
What’s scary 4 Yankees opponents is Torres is recovering Frazier Andujar arent dressing Florial Abreau r n AZ - Adams - Acevedo still n 3A
Get work richie d https://t.co/zzVTeYJ3gS
I’m just different everything is done bigger &amp; better with me !!!
@jimcallisMLB how close r Acevedo &amp; Abreau to opening next season n the top 💯
@JonathanMayo Wasn’t Callis was a major league scout
@JonathanMayo they r saying Abreau is the best pitcher n the AZFL that includes a top 20 guy &amp; Sheffield do u 4c him n ya upcoming top 100
The knicks r as advertised - HOTT GARBAGE
@Joelsherman1 Frazier doesn’t play CF and how much they like him will depend on how much Ellsbury money they eat or trading Gardy Hicks just turned 28
@davidtabrown @Joelsherman1 Exactly Murphy not Hughes
@AndrewMarchand Pretty close 2 tho think yanks have decided next year spring training is his time not gonna make any moves like that and rattle the cage
@AndrewMarchand Betances won’t loose his post season spot everyone sounds nuts he’s a 4x all star and they not gonna ruin him for next year
@iamErica_Mena Yes indeed
Catch me &amp; sis Monday the 30th we baaaaaaack !!! https://t.co/yN0jasEDPY
He’s def gonna opt out now unless the loyalty kicks n - he can get 100 milli
The real Tanaka !!!!
These yAnkees just seem different
@NYPinstripes4ev Yes u r
These Yankees r different !!!!
Chapman time but how do u not bring T Frazier back jersey guy looks happy as hell 2b here &amp; is n the middle of everything @JonathanMayo
Big Yankee moments for the baby bombers here n 8th Didi Judge Frazier Sanchize Headley all come thru big
Damn Gordon Heyward apparently goes down while Yankees r coming back bostonjust can’t  catch a break 🙏🏾 go out to him for a speedy recovery
Wooooow everyone is bailed out so far it’s 0-0 for a minute
Yo I love starlin Castro but seriously wtf is he thinking couldn’t possibly have thought that was faster then running thru the bag
@Yankees And still counted for 1 run
I can tell how that pitcher walked off the mound he voted for trump
All of a sudden starlin error looks huge let’s c how this plays out
Gray pitched well but I never felt comfortable every inning 20 pitches men on Mcullers having 10 pitch innings just seemed more dominant
@Buster_ESPN just tweeted 21 2/3 innings of playoff baseball for sonny gray &amp; not 1 run scored for him - now that’s sad he deserves better
@ktsharp @Buster_ESPN Damn shame
Wtf was that starlin answering my question about what to do with Gleyber Torres tonight I suppose
@jaysonst Every time I c hit down the line I ask why does Frazier play so far off the line every single time gives up doubles instead of singles
Yankees needed this 1 Sonny Gray stat line looks ok but it looked like n every inning it could fall apart and it did on Robertson’s watch
If I was sonny gray I’d ask to b out he’s gotta hate NY
Guess that says it down 3 guess Gray couldn’t have done that smh
I assume Gray couldn’t have done that bases loaded no outs not good yankees go down just by how much
I honestly don’t blame Sonny Gray for hating NY he does deserve better shoulda finished the inning he earned it
R u fucking kidding me a walk &amp; an interference how innings starts -sonny gray hates being here I can c it in his 👀 that’s smile said it all
Player is safe @ first but didn’t touch bag heading back penaltys offset he’s out !!!!
@NYPinstripes4ev Didn’t touch bag going back penalty’s offset he’s out
U better challenge that call Joe
don’t get why yankees don’t take what’s given like really a bunt down third is an auto hit first second 0 outs isn’t that a good thing
So I’m hearing trump stuckbhis foot n his mouth again what was Said I missed it something that has 🏳️‍🌈 enraged - hanging gay people
Ok maybe only 4 pitches
@jcrasnick Makes sense but what’s ya point
Common Sanchize ohhh my bad that’s Romine smh
Castro just added 8-10 pitches 2 grays count with that error
Gray throws a lot of pitches &amp; just never seems n control but with that said Castro has to field the damn ball on that routine grounder
people took outta context my quitting the show tweet smh if u pay any attention instead of looking 4 hyperbole n posts it woulda made sense
Don’t understand why people r saying the lineup is being shaken up romine catches 1 game outta 9 Sanchize is DH big deal
@UncleWillySon That would be crazy all things considered an embarrassment of riches
@TheKingKoala27 @JonathanMayo Gleyber won’t b ready til mid season needs ABs n 3A I def want Andujar to get his shot he deserves it done nothing but mash all the way up
Is Frazier playing his way back into NY or have yanks already decided 2 go with kids get under tax or can the do both @JonathanMayo
Yanks 2 many @ 3rd Frazier -Headley - Andujar - Torres &amp; n OF Judge - Gardy - Ells -Hicks -Frazier &amp; util  Wade vs Toe decisions decisions
Yanks rotation looks set up for years 2 come Severino - Monty - Gray - Tanaka (opt n)- CC (resign) Acevedo - Adams - Sheffield -
@Jerome92198458 I retired ya moma pussy
@Mz_ThickCoCo Been has enough to retire sweety stay woke google me
@NYPinstripes4ev Of course wouldn’t do anything else
@LUCKY_CAPO Tonight I imagine I’d be referring to the cumulative mentions as opposed to the singular pay attention
Trump lies about everything like seriously everything it’s raining but I walk outside it’s sunny -don’t understand how his cabinet allows it
Back to houston and more ⚾️ extended season since clearly I don’t watch 🏈
Ima retire from L&amp;HH &amp; just let people talk about me in there scenes
Same shit different year
@Fyocca123 But Headley is essentially same age and is signed for 13 milli so Headley stays
@RealSkipBayless Vandy
I imagine todd Frazier loves playing @ Home but this is his FA contract coming up he better get his money and it won’t b n pinstripes
Clear yankees prefer Frazier 2 Headley what happens when season is over &amp; Fraziers FA &amp; Headley has 1 year left @JackCurryYES
@jimcallisMLB @MLBPipeline @MLBazFallLeague With the way Sheffield &amp; Florial r playing n AZFL do u foresee a top 50 &amp; 30 preseason rankings respectively and Acevedo cracking top 100
@jimcallisMLB @MLBPipeline @MLBazFallLeague What Yanks gonna do with Miguel Andujar &amp; Clint Frazier really doesn’t seem to be space on team for either presently constructed
Trump dont worry bout AROD or football how bout learning what regions u preside over of a quick geography lesson like PR or US Virgin Isles
Doesn’t matter whose around at the beginning the trick is 2 b around at the end !!!
Rise shine give God the glory
@miakhalifa smh tried to say hi didn’t realize they were putting u out the game - what happened
@BarstoolHubbs @NYPinstripes4ev Bad week for shorty Gilbert Arenas aired her out for sliding n his dms smh does that show still come in worse week ever - I’m nominating her
@AndrewMarchand How bout ask him before pulling him a convo is always good
hard 2 trade Gardner seems like club house leader &amp; glue Ellsbury contract obviously n love with Hicks &amp; Judge = Jeter short straw C Frazier
the guy we traded 2 get Cessa &amp; more importantly GREEN didn’t make the Cubs division roster - wonder how the haters feel now Cashmans 4 Prez
https://t.co/6chnLjCIeq

@JBiLZ Boogie what we doing yankees cubs WS u get tickets for chi Game I get ticket for NY game
