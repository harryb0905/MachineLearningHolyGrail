@MissFuramera Have never labeled myself a creep nor have I even been a creep
@JonathanMayo @jimcallisMLB  yanks 30 list I must say very well done - If healthy I think Abreu is top 50 pitcher shoulda been n back of the 100 -  you‚Äôre higher on Schmidt &amp; Stephan Im with Gil &amp; king before injury but very well done guys- made my day going over the top 30
@BenBadler How good r the 2 Dominican kids the Yankees seem locked in with

@Amirkhary Yeah ok I‚Äôve said that over 200xs  !!!
Affect is usually a verb, and it means to impact or change. Effect is usually a noun, an effect is the result of a change.  Common people step up ya grammar in 19
I liked Michelle Rodriguez before 10 minutes ago she shoulda shut the hell up instead of letting her ignorance shine through !!!

Liam Neesom our here talking bout killing black folk cuz apparently a friend was raped by one - so I guess  rape and genocide of black folks for 100s of years gives me the right to do a radio promo run about killing white folks just curious
@BR_NBA @BleacherReport @FOXSportsSW Musta been super uncomfortable for Trey And whoever else was on podium listening to KP and not getting asked any questions
@ish_since89 @JonathanMayo This list is through my eyes I just feel Florial had a down year and the contact issues concerns me especially now heading into double A- if healthy &amp; that‚Äôs a big if Loaisiga is a 2 in ur rotation !!!
Yankee top 10 prospects   1 Loaisiga  2 Florial  3 Abreau  4 Peiriera  5 D Garcia  6 Cabello  7 Siegler  8 king  9 Contreras  10 Whitlock -Schmidt -Sauer - Acevedo - Estrada - adams -           Madina - Gil - Stephan   Volatile list lotta youngsters @JonathanMayo
@Amirkhary Facts - lol

@sahluwal @drocktrot Shits so crazy out here right now I mean really crazy
@CNN Just switch over to Republicans he‚Äôll be happily accepted freaking asshole
@utrippinalice @Bethany_Haupt What kinda dumb ass took the video and the commentary was absolutely insane bitch do t have time to stop or hinder a kidnapping fuck is going on in Texas is right
@Rap920 Free agents should be supplemental pieces have the talent add what u don‚Äôt missing out on positionally I have to assess the Knick roster but obviously KD &amp; kyrie are the targets but with this team maybe ur right putting ‚≠ïÔ∏è in square pegs
@Rap920 Sad part this could be expedited with the drafting of Spider Mitchell over Frenchie Frankie add that to KD and u have something or even add him to KP u had something
@Rap920 I‚Äôm not a Fizdale fan at all &amp; I think they build thu the draft most importantly assemble a team that is cohesive &amp; built for the long haul Robinson - Trier &amp; Knox was a very good draft add that to Dotson , Noah and d Smith jr ur at least assembling talent with a top 3 pick
@Rap920 Dennis Smith is learning to play off the ball as he had to with Doncik this year but he‚Äôs a talent at this point talent trumps all - with a Top 3 pick &amp; a future first rounder I‚Äôll take my chances - loved KP but he‚Äôs never healthy and quite frankly didn‚Äôt wanna be here
@Rap920 Gutted the team what exactly was the guy hardaway was over payed and actually not better then Dotson  lee hadn‚Äôt played all year and another contract gone and KP wasn‚Äôt the alpha player he‚Äôs a solid 2 not the franchise starter nor can he stay on the floor for a full season
Hey Fellas wake up knowing ya girl in the A in another dudes bed getting thoroughly tossed !!!
@GENTLEMENFOXX Love it
@Rap920 Kd - Kyrie plus the top 3 pick
@toss4life Def not as bad as u just made it seem wasn‚Äôt a great N.Y. Yankee type deal but we got cap room rid of a couple guys got picks and D Smith Jr
@DwaJay Yes KP didn‚Äôt wanna be here wasn‚Äôt gonna get true value for him not proving he‚Äôs healthy - shoulda picked D smith Over Frankie 2 years ago couple first rounders and cap space not bad - didn‚Äôt think KP was AD anyway
2019 I‚Äôm doing it my way anyone care to join me !!
@JoshWatkins1977 @JonHeyman U sound like an idiot saying Correa isn‚Äôt worth 5 million when the difference is 750k to a major league sports team

@JonHeyman Crazy how these owners nickel &amp; diming these guys

@keithlaw Touch√© this will be his year !!!
0 ‚öæÔ∏è America   ‚öæÔ∏è  Prospectus -Loaisiga 64 / Florial 66   ‚öæÔ∏è  MLB Pipeline 2 Florial  66- Loaisiga 57   Keith law D Garcia 61 - Periera 101 Florial top 110  Yanks have 4 top üíØ types depending on who U  ask  D Garcia - Florial  -Loaisiga- Florial  with Abreau - Cabello in wings
@keithlaw I‚Äôm definitely a big Deivi Garcia fan but wow 61 &amp; Johnny Loisiga doesn‚Äôt appear at all so you have Garcia as the number 1 yankee prospect with Florial &amp; Periera  behind him on the top üíØ peripheral
@mamajeweldollaz @Oprah Go to sleep
Never been one for the fake shit so if u can‚Äôt produce in real life don‚Äôt pretend on social media , the Richie D hype train need the real deal save ya BS !!!!! Said what I Said
@eye_kandii &amp; vics versa
@SizweDhIomo_ @Chinaaa_Doll Anything less isn‚Äôt a friend
Yankees top üíØ ish prospects  Florial - Loaisiga &amp; Pieriera  I‚Äôm thinking good healthy  years from Abreau  , Cabello &amp; Siegler good put them right back n the prospect game !!!!
Wtf did Mariah just say I‚Äôll run you over with a vehicle ?? Lmao that was classic
@bruthamarc Then Im Good w/o ‚òùüèæ cuz
@hunt4prospects Yeah he‚Äôs a beast as is E Periera but for now Florial - Loaisiga- Abreau - Siegler - periera - Acevedo - Whitlock - Deivi Garcia - then maybe cabello  just cuz of proximity to big leagues
@hunt4prospects Cabello super high for someone who just came state side last year
Mr.Monday night at 8pm tune in !!! Shits getting crazy if u were K would u take the plea the state offered or go to trial ???  Answer below lemme hear ya thoughts
@Chris_Broussard Ashy woul$ Azd ever approve a trade to NY much less stay ? Bit confused by that thinking clearly NY goes against everything he‚Äôs said to want most notably a winner
@NYSTAT3OFMIIND Yup done unless the price drastically drops on either of them yanks r done maybe a bs swig man pitcher Adam Warren type
No prospect trade has yet hurt the Yankees thus far I‚Äôm not high on Rutherford - Mateo is terrible - kap can‚Äôt stay on field - not so high on Fowler neither apparently is Oakland anymore - no room for McKinney - think these 3 if any will hurt Sheffield &amp; widener -guzman
@JonathanMayo 2 questionns today for ya 1 how far was Abreau from the topüíØ is he only a couple graduations away - if healthy he‚Äôs still got 3 plus plus pitches upside of an ace n my eyes but prob a 2-3 &amp; are u high in Cabello - Pereria  &amp; D Garcia &amp; I‚Äôm talking Deivi not Dermis
@TMZ If only a few don‚Äôt make that trip says a lot about the Sawx

@ItsMikeHill Zion is no where near the impact player Lebron was not even close - hops yesnof handles - vision - passing - scoring - lebron obviously had ball in his hands all the time Zion doesn‚Äôt create like brown did - no way not even close
@JonathanMayo No Albert Abreau üò°üò°  Widener jumped bout 17 spots &amp; to think they gave himup for Bledoing Brandon Drury
Bout time to rekindle my friendship with @JonathanMayo - I dvred the top üíØ bout to watch this now should be interesting   Florial - Loaisiga &amp; Abreau fully expect to c them guys c y‚Äôall when it‚Äôs over

Yankees can talk that pitching shit all they want I watched about every game &amp; timely hitting &amp; Ks were much more of an issue along with terrible Sanchize Injured Judge &amp; Hicks - horrible 2nd half  Severino - no exhistent Bird &amp; bad Gardner no Frazier and still won üíØ
@nubianangel27 You‚Äôd be broker then usual this week then
@ilygiovanna @ComplexMusic Of course ,  the funny thing is my genious wasn‚Äôt fully acknowledged moments like these are all the acknowledgement i needs - cheat on wife - nobody knows with who - mistress upset can‚Äôt capitalize no face or name with situation - fake apology - Complex gives u shine next up song
@nubianangel27 Watch on the 12th

@BaseballBros @ellennDaniellee Hoping Miguel Andujar turn is next
@TMZ Not sincere,  apology issued cuz nobody knew who she was and this was a creative way to be recognized get her name out in public - was sick of being some girl dude cheated with had to put face &amp; name with the deed how else would she make the blogs &amp; get followers - the end
@Chris_Broussard Def not winning 53 I‚Äôm still laughing
@Complex caught cheating ruin a marriage - people refer to you as the other girl never mention ya name so no real clout gained  - u get mad   u can‚Äôt capitalize cuz nobody knows its u that‚Äôs in this mess  - create a fake no tear crocodile apology that way who u are is made public -the end
@DonLagreca the caller that just called spoke about Levine  because these comment fall in line with the Betances comments a couple years back so it seems like he just speaks w/o thinking about consequences or repercussions- think 2xs speak once
@RealMichaelKay the caller that just called spoke about Levine like that because these comment fall in line with the Betances comments a couple years back so it seems like he just speaks w/o thinking about consequences or repercussions- think 2xs speak once
Happy hump day only 1 &amp;  a half days left before the weekend - yes 1.5 lol y‚Äôall know the second half of Fridays workday is spent thinking about &amp; pregaming for the weekend !!!!
@bigsantiago Sanchize 275 -280 ave - 35 homers -110 RBIs ops over 850 &amp; war around 4 and that‚Äôs with deficient D which means the O will be amazing - next season too offensive catcher n MLB save this tweet refer to it next October
@jaysonst not denying his year was historic but hyperbole aside he Was ok before last year and 1 year doesn‚Äôt sell me - I wanna c him do it again -but all things considered great pick up you are so right
@NEALWILLIAMS610 Well apparently yankees agreed with me 6 years and 140 when u can get happ for a fraction is silly
@bigsantiago Good thing ur not a prophet just a a yankee hater Sanchize toast at 26 nice try tho
@AstrosFansUK @jaysonst @OaklandAUK As had 18 games against angels - mariners &amp; Texas trash padded victory total wiped out by Yankees In WC
@AstrosFansUK @jaysonst What‚Äôs that mean when playing trash teams 18 times a year As - Mariners  - Angels
Yankee prediction   1-Sanchize has a great year  2-Bird wins 1b &amp; has a good season 3- Gleyber- Andujar continue shining  4- Machado signs  5- Stanton hit 45-50 homers  6- Frazier takes over left  7- Loisigna forces way into rotation  8- Acevedo becomes Betances 2.0 Yanks win üíØ
Pitching depth is essential but valuing a 4-5 starter at 6 &amp; 140 milli is crazy - if u can‚Äôt put up 6-7 runs against a normal teams 4-5 then something is wrong with ya O !!!
Corbin goes to Nats that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm cool with Machado - Happ Signing and going to war with Severino - Paxton - Happ - Tanaka - Cc with Loisigna - German - Acevedo - King &amp; Adams n the wings
@BNightengale Hmmmm
@jaysonst Can he do it again ?? NL east a lil different AL west was/is trash !!!

@Bigbdog75 COmmon rich What fury won every round except maybe 3 was put down twice so those r both 10-8 and maybe 1 more 10-9 that left 9 10-9!rounds for him - fury won but the knockdown was ugly and that‚Äôs why nobody is beefing
@nynymary R y‚Äôall fucking retarded I clearly said fury won even after being out on his ass - 2 10-8 rounds didnt tie the fight up
@DripAnonymous What‚Äôs ya pointbmy guybibsaid he still won wtf u talking about

@StandsReport @MadIsaiahThomas @BleacherReport Not a top tier D 1 he‚Äôs a top 20 player in his class but he took money so I guess we‚Äôll never know  - he‚Äôs 6‚Äô7 pg def gonna have a shot at the pros
@Eric_M888 @jaysonst So 1 start ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è which they prob won‚Äôt use anyway at the beginning of the season
@KHausNY @jaysonst Cessa would be 4th starter in triple A but because of no options he‚Äôll be n the bullpen - Loisigna - German - Acevedo - king - Cortes kids need a look when CC goes down not another free agent
@mamajeweldollaz Apparently a bunch of people everyday
@ilygiovanna She sound fucking ridiculous and she‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with everying n the world today ok I exaggerate

@marcusdj813 Florida isn‚Äôt as bad as Mississippi but never the less voter suppression was rampant - let‚Äôs c this new act allowing ex convicts to vote goes could change climate of Florida politics if it‚Äôs real
@willwright1974 The people in Mississippi don‚Äôt care bout the people in Mississippi why should anyone else - did u not see who they just elected senator ??
Mississippi reminds the US why it's:   50th in income 48th in economy 3rd in welfare dependency  50th in healthcare 50th in infant mortality  2nd in obesity  47th in education  50th in college readiness  47th in employment  7th in depression   couldn‚Äôt happen to a better state
Triple A rotation gonna be stupid Scranton - Loisigna - Abreau * - Acevedo - king - adams - Cortes   Might start Abreau n Trenton 2A because of injuries and didn‚Äôt get alotta work in 2A last year but will be n 3A before long
Yankees need Corbin - ( Severino - Paxton - Tanaka - Corbin - CC ) amazing rotation def top 2-3 !! With Loisigna - Abreau - German - Cessa  - adams - Acevedo &amp; king waiting n wings
@nytimes Mississippi I would‚Äôve understood but in NY common ma - she clearly was ready to do something else with her life !!

Mississippi is a scary place Hyde - smith won but How could Repubs even allow her to run after the comments she made
The fact that woman won in Mississippi show why I‚Äôll never go back to that state again - they might fuck around Abdul bring back slavery - but Mississippi will always b Mississippi I suppose

@Skin_Diamond Dm me
@MayaBijouXXX Positive vibes
@JonathanMayo @MLBPipeline Is Everson Pereria in ya yankee top 10 and how far from ya top 100
@JonHeyman Exactly &amp; all the kids start n 3A when in actuality they should be fighting for the 5th spot Loisigna- Sheffield- Acevedo - king - Cessa even Adams deserves a look
@blackmike Indeed we have plenty of time but especially n Ga expect some fuckery
@blackmike I dunno can u - interesting to hear ya opinion on this
@brianmctaggart @jcrasnick So McCullers - Morton and keuchel all possibly gone sheeesh hope Whitley is ready
@Feinsand Big CC fan but yankees still need 2 of Happ - keuchel - Corbin - Morton  - Paxton -Kluber or Carrasco and this prob means if all healthy no kids start in the rotation and I don‚Äôt like that either Loisigna or Sheff deserve a look
So now yankees have 15 mill tied up in CC &amp; Gardy - 15 milli for the mentor program - still need 2 of Happ - Corbin - keuchel - Paxton - Kluber -  Morton &amp; I‚Äôm guessing all the kids start off n 3A Loisigna - Sheff - King - Adams - Acevedo
@AndrewMarchand Sounds like he‚Äôs open for the change - that should change everything !!!!!!
If u do not vote dont fucking complain !!!
It‚Äôs GO time people GO VOTE !!!!!
@ilygiovanna Yup
@ESPNChiCubs @Buster_ESPN Girardi time
@BillShaikin @Buster_ESPN And if he played D his war woulda been lower cuz he sucks n the field 57 games on D is not a mvp my friends
@bambiblackxxx Musta been a song u were reciting cuz the only shooting well nevermind .....
@yankees88063 @Kyle11081 @WeAre9PennState @Feinsand Why so u can have no money left of someone gets hurt - 2 pitchers let‚Äôs the kids fight for 5 if u need a 5th starter n the playoffs ya other starters suck
@Feinsand Gonna be hard the kids deserve a shot at 5th slot outta spring &amp; Yankees need 2 of Happ ,Corbin or keuchel so CC complicates things unless u don‚Äôt want Loisigna- Sheff - King - German - Acevedo or Adams with a shot outta ST
14 Tanaka an allstar *   15 Severino burst on scene   16 ROY 2nd place Sanchize after only 1/2 season Lil less   17 Unanimous ROY &amp; MVP finalist- Aaron Judge -Chad Green becomes ‚Äú a dude ‚Äú  18 finalist Andujar &amp; Torres should be 1 &amp; 3 respectively but we will see   Homegrown core
@Yankeesnut74 Happ *
@Yankeesnut74 That‚Äôs my point u need both Hall &amp; Corbin but then CC has to go cuz the kids need a shot at 5th spot outta spring
Problem with Yanks bringing back CC is they still need 2 starters - CC &amp; Corbin essentially is same as CC &amp; Happ , gives them same rotation no improvement &amp; if u get all 3 u don‚Äôt give the kids a shot - bad move Loisigna- Sheffield - üëë &amp; Acevedo deserve shots !!
BA top 10 yanks   1 LHP Sheffield 2 Of Florial 3 RHP  Loaisiga 4 OF Pereira 5 C Siegler  6 RHP king  7 RHP Garcia 8 RHP Contreras 9 OF Cabello 10 RHP Abreu  Not mad - I still have Abreau 4 but I get injury history - not so high on üëë &amp; Acevedo if healthy is in - Thairo comes back
@loveindoe I want some
@JosinaAnderson Yes here they r down 8 with 2 left n the third

My guess Dems take the house &amp; republicans keep senate !!!! Beats the blank they had I suppose , if you disagree tell me why ??
Dems need 23 seat net gain for control of The House &amp; The U.S. Senate has 51 Republicans &amp; 49 Democrats (including 2 indies). There are 35 seats up in 2018 - including special elections in Minnesota and Mississippi - of which 26 are held by Democrats. Dems need to gain 2 seats

Barack Obama is a dynamic speaker woooooow mesmerizing  - don‚Äôt be Charlie Brown people !!!!!
A year of Happ &amp; Corbin is prob good for 6-7 wins puts Yankees back in a good place - Severino - Tanaka - Corbin - Happ - Loisigna sign me up Sanchez will be better have faith n ü¶Ö- gonna miss Didi for sure / Stanton should be better Judge wont be hurt &amp; usher n red thunder
@YankeesWFAN Nobody is dumping on Gardner justvfelk it was an overpay which it was - he didn‚Äôt look good in the 2nd half period - could bought him out gave him 5 and called it a day
Whaaaaaaaaat the fuck just happened‚Äù how to get away with murder ‚Äú !!!! Best show on tv !!!!
@Jared_Grossman5 @Feinsand @Orioles They just started even thinking about signing international prospects they usually trade the money for rule 5 guys and give them back once they don‚Äôt make the roster - progress

@TONY313MONTANA Detroit the family  OGs !!!!
@JonHeyman @Feinsand Wtf so all this to save 2.5 million bucks he‚Äôs not worth new 7.5 shoulda got a 5 with the 2 buyout ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not 9.5 in 19 !!!!
@JackCurryYES prob on vaca with the family but common man help me understand this Gardner deal - decline option - pay buy out 2 milli - bring back for 7.5 wtf are they thinking - so with buyout he gets 9.5 for a 4th outfielder
So the Red Sox spent 300k on alcohol at a boston night club after winning the WS - So every night was a celebration when BMF was around cuz I watched 300k get spent nightly when I was running them dudes around NYC  !!!!!

6-0 do I stay with Robertson for 2 the. Chapman or stay with plan Britton &amp; Chapman 8 &amp; 9
Might wanna review my tweets I‚Äôve always said records don‚Äôt mean anything - it‚Äôs how ur playing , when ur playing - think the Yankees can‚Äôt go on a run and win 12 of the next 20
@TitDeflatey @BNightengale Crazy
Ummm yeah so about this reliever that‚Äôs supposed to be so great ??
I get ron darling used to be a met but seriously these commentators are anti yankee and shouldn‚Äôt be doing this game
Talking all this shit about the A‚Äôs reliever and I‚Äôm willing to bet he gives up a hit !!!! Let‚Äôs bet
Sidebar with everything being said about Kavanaugh does he get voted in on Saturday or have the people spoken and A few Republicans listen ??
Lucroy wit a case of the Sanchizes
FYI Fernando Rodney sucks so I dunno why they acting like he doesn‚Äôt ??
@CrimMinds_CBS Deep
Andujar pissed he was taken out but how can u leave him n with the 2 bad throws n only 2 or 3 opportunities especially with no glove Luke at first
I don‚Äôt like Robertson n this spot I like Green after Dellin completes these 2 innings the Britton &amp; Chapman
@Fox_FZ6R @mikeygrogins1 @Joelsherman1 U shouldn‚Äôt make ridiculous comments - Romine is a back up for a reason relax with that romine shit like he‚Äôs actually ever not sucked n his whoooole career
@Joelsherman1 Hell no way to early giving up a possible 2 Abs from Andujar
@Way_of_Carlitos I agree chad green now maybe batter by batter if anything
@KingZito973 Well hidsight 20/20 but Severino did his job and Sanchez has looked amAzing behind the plate thus far - fuck Romine has no ceiling u dont play the back up n big games Sanchize is ya man - period
Dellin Dellin Dellin !!!!!!! Only thru 12 pitches do u bring him back out hmmmmmm ü§îü§îü§î
Who the hell is this broadcaster on TBS that clearly is on A‚Äôs payroll @JackCurryYES like seriously this is annoying listening to this guy stan the A‚Äôs
@LilUziAlex_TV He‚Äôs  actually very good look at the stats maybe as a catcher u were bad which is why he‚Äôs a yankee and ur watching
Severino feasting Next inning has to be batter by batter , I mean he hasn‚Äôt given up a hit yet if not for voit &amp; Andujar take away 15-20 pitches and this isn‚Äôt even a convo
Fucking Andujar &amp; Voit better come thru with the bat cuz the glove has forsaken them - fucking ridiculous 2 bad throws &amp; a ball that shoulda been caught - gotta sure up then corners , period
Damn already the baby only 2 months - guessing shorty couldn‚Äôt wait to hatch this smh or is this drama for the YouTube show my 13 yr nephew watches https://t.co/plYMx87tde
All Rise !!!!!!!!! Aaron Judge !!!!!!!!
Criminal Minds - empire &amp; star on DVR today - yankees on TBS win or go home Wild card game !!!!!
@MLBPipeline Damn Drury trade sucks Widener cracked the top üíØ &amp; they gave him &amp; Solak  up for Drury which turned into Happ - so Solak - Widener - Drury &amp; Billy McKinney for Happ
@slutsaucekhloe Yup all 58.1k of them
@KingZito973 The Sanchize is catching
@KingZito973 Who told u that lie A‚Äôs actually have worse average &amp; ops  n majors n pitches over 95mph
Big game tonight - AL wildcard need big games from Cutch , Judge , Hicks , Stanton ,Voit , Didi , Sanchez - Andujar &amp; Torres   Severino for 4 then Green - Robertson -Betances , Britton &amp; Chapman

@BleacherReport And now he‚Äôs hooping n a random league playing against horrible competition prob not improving instead of being a top ranked HS senior with every college knocking on his door for the 1&amp;.done - great decision dad !!!
Bit shocked Severino is pitching the WC game -I guess long term he‚Äôs the ACE and needs to be treated as such -make amends for last years debacle - short short leash @JackCurryYES
So someone thought it was ok for these 2 women to act like this - u kidding me right ??!!!
another note Kavanagh headed down stream w/o a paddle Repubs allowing FBI to do w/e this week - taking bets on outcome   A- still becomes S/C Judge  B- doesn‚Äôt get the nod , goes back to appellate w/o issue  C- jail time for sexual misconduct  D - n/jail but loses judge for lian
Yankees should start Tanaka can‚Äôt get past needing Happ 2xs if they advance vs Boston   1 -Happ vs Sale  2 -Severino vs Price  3 -Tanaka vs who cares  4 -CC vs who cares  5 - Happ vs Sale

@AngieB1966 I repeat the new season just started on Thursday how am I late - I caught it on Friday
265 homers torres  breaks Seattle record   20 homers from every spot n lineup - never been done before   45 doubles Andujar breaks DiMaggio rookie record   100 wins on season  Pretty good day for yankees
@Breezie10 One day late only ep I hadn‚Äôt seen was this season premiere

First Em now Wayne can‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm not mad bout them guys being n heavy rotation - the old will always be new again - next up baggy jeans &amp; long white tees
So I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs safe to say Wayne is back with a vengeance!!!!
@DJMOS @RealSkipBayless Not really nobody cares bout his-opinion
People forget years ago Ashanti was gonna sign with cash money and ended up doing the mini label deal with E1 instead - how quickly everyone forgets or maybe it was just that long ago
Meaning nothing that happened today will deter the republicans from moving forward - but then I could be pleasantly surprised
@Ronturner10 U got my point wasn‚Äôt literal - saying nothing that happened today is gonna deter the republicans from moving forward
Kavanagh will be named judge tomorrow morning - kinda scary isn‚Äôt it !!!!
@hitmansteviej @Stevie_JII D1 hoops good shit !!!
@Bjays5 Who the fuck made a decision I said he‚Äôs falling apart paybattention and stay the fuck out my tweets with dumb ass responses
@WajahatAli @ilygiovanna Actually he‚Äôs rallying the republicans with this speech especially republican men
Lindsey Graham to the rescue !!!! Republican men will rally behind his comments only hope for Democrats is republican women see through the ‚Äú sham ‚Äú and the Cosby reference !!!
Call me crazy but Kavanagh if falling apart
What I‚Äôve learned from Kavanagh  1 he played all the sports one can play  2 he likes beer - drinks beer - still likes and drinks beer  3 he documented everything in his life cuz his daddy did  4 the end
He likes beer , he still likes beer , yes he drank beer , still likes and drinks beer
@Xtrah1 He likes beer , he still likes beer , yes he drank beer , still likes and drinks beer
https://t.co/PCa5k4kh2e
@sportsandra @680TheFan @Entrepreneur @MWMcCreary Chick- fil - A is everything I‚Äôm not surprised one bit
Kavanagh is heated !!!
Crazy shit about this hearing is if u watch it on MSNBC he‚Äôs going down &amp; she was an amazing witness but on FOX she wasn‚Äôt believable and the Dems set this all up - long story short Kavanagh will be a Judge by Monday morning !!!!
@DeeLife1 Cory booker is very solid
@TMZ Just magnified his level of confusion
@JosinaAnderson That‚Äôs a good for the kneelers !!! He deserves a job
@YourVictoria_ I got u !!!

@JoeFaceBecker They better find that wave cuz they didn‚Äôt not look good right now
@JoeFaceBecker Gonna win tomorrow then 2xs n boston for 100
I watched ‚Äú Empire &amp; Star ‚Äú and I don‚Äôt remember shit from last season they shoulda played last season finally last week so I‚Äôd be refreshed
All of a sudden it‚Äôs 5 &amp; counting so before u say anything about Cosby let‚Äôs see the Kavanagh tally !!! Sexual predator(s) one headed down stream for 3-10 the other headed to the highest court for life
@justinawithaG Impossible choice
@JonathanMayo  -just saw ya inbox &amp; I been saying since the Drury trade I didn‚Äôt like it - Solak &amp; Widener was a lot  for a guy who was never better then Andujar in the first place - never understood the move now Widener in the top üíØperipheral  and Solak gonna be good as well
Still going with Tanaka in extra rest for the WC this game means nothing - go 5 get a tuneup then see ya next Wednesday

Ima say this again live I‚Äôve been saying it from the beginning Aaron Boone isn‚Äôt an x &amp; o manager &amp; wil be severely out coached come playoffs !!!! Facts @JackCurryYES
The shit Pat Mahomes is pulling  off in the first few weeks is absolutely ridiculous!!!!
@lLOVEDAYAMI üòç

@keithlaw Sad cuz ted Cruz sucks
@keithlaw Can he win the lone star ? Haven‚Äôt elected a dem in some time
Preach dat sermon den https://t.co/TrDhqNv3pI
Absolutely retarded to think happ would start WC game with Tanaka &amp; Severino pitching well especially with happ being lights out vs boston - common people think
@BaseballAmerica Have to agree he should‚Äôve been def the best of all the Atl pitching prospects now that control has caught up to his ‚Äú stuff ‚Äú
‚úàÔ∏è must b nice https://t.co/qsWWnC46gA
So many top 25 teams lost today can‚Äôt remember a shakeup like this in some time - college  üèà crazy day
Like trump asks what was Nike thinking lol fucking idiot &amp; wait til kaep merchant comes out sheesh https://t.co/vql9YEWvwS
Yankees clinch WC , crazy thing is a 5-3 finish wins them üíØ that‚Äôs a lot of wins in any year   Braves win NL east    Should b very interesting this October &amp; beyond !!
Tiger shoots a 65 and has a 3 stroke lead - Golf sure is better when üêÖ is healthy and playing well - might even catch a sport center highlight !!! PGA tour say thank ur relevant again
That‚Äôs a lot of signings buddy &amp; I stated all of them were questions so no I didn‚Äôt say resign or sign anyone - all posed as questions with out the ? Mark sorry for the confusion
Yankees questions next season  1 resign CC  2 resign Happ  3 pick up Gardy Option  4 faith n the kids ( Loisigna &amp; Sheffield )  5 chase Corbin  6 what about mcutchen   7 trade gray  8 Andujar ya 3b or chase Machado  9 chase Harper  10 ü¶Ö ya 1b  11 bullpen 12 what about Frazier
Sex work game must suck cuz I‚Äôll be damned if I buy pics &amp; subscribe to premium snap with pornhub n existence - plus my DMs look well nevermind I‚Äôm talking to much
@LONGLIVEDONRON Don‚Äôt matter purse is 9 milli gets that ranking and confidence up for the majors only 4 of them a year - health is good he will b fine
@austinreidnj @BryanHoch If people cared about batting average anymore you‚Äôd be right but since they don‚Äôt his 9th highest and 20th best n Al &amp; MLB on base pct makes him allstar caliber a ready
Tiger is on fire today thru 12 nice 4 stroke lead here at Players championships !!!!  If he stays healthy he might come close to catching Jack
Congrats to the Braves for winning the NL East !!!! Now the real test
@altamuramarc Ur an idiot and now u blocked for being such an idiot
Naw he‚Äôs out gonna get more money somewhere else
@DRoweTax @Gord2100 @Yankees @YESNetwork @JackCurryYES Romine sucks knock it off period point blank he has no potential to ever get Abs anywhere everyone please stop
@Gord2100 @Yankees @YESNetwork @JackCurryYES Well considering he‚Äôs been batting 7th for ever now 8 isn‚Äôt much of a drop
@TommieLHHATL https://t.co/G4eSEtnSEJ
@680TheFan Braves r gonnna be a problem n the playoffs - I like them a lot of pitching shows up mostly bullpen
@rileyreidx3 Me
And I was just about to brag about my favorite minor league pitcher Johnny lasagna - but I‚Äôll refrain since he comes n the game giving up bombs
Next years way too early NY Yankee rotation prediction   Severino  Tanaka  Happ  Corbin  Sheffield    3A Loisigna German  Cessa  Acevedo  King  Stephans - Swanson   2A Abreau  Whitlock  D Garcia
interested to c what Yanks do with staff - do they go get FA or do they value the kids - I say they make a run At Corbin - resign Happ &amp; or CC &amp; let  Loisigna - Sheffield - German - Adams - Cessa fight it out for the 5th spot @JackCurryYES
@rex_rexchapman Agreed !!!
@rex_rexchapman @MichaelRapaport Jelly fam before jelly fam
@MLBPipeline @JonathanMayo @Yankees @BryanHoch @swbrailriders @TrentonThunder @TampaTarpons @ChasRiverDogs @SIYanks @PulaskiYanks @Topsheff42 And quietly Deivi Garcia coulda made that list and people still don‚Äôt respect king and his stuff !!!
@altamuramarc Everything 31 pct Latina and 7 pct of black women voted for him so they clearly were the minority‚Äôs when whites women majority voted for him - make sense now
Wonder how that 53pct of white women that voted for trump feel now  !!!!! https://t.co/Ahj9qMZdbw
@rileyreidx3 I mean I would imagine u did that to yaself don‚Äôt wanna be asked to help with adding and subtraction don‚Äôt be a math teacher
Even after yesterday‚Äôs dud I‚Äôm going Tanaka in WC , Happ hopefully game 1 &amp; Severino game 2 vs Boston !!!! another dud next week vs Tampa &amp; my mind could change !!!  still saying yankees win 3 vs bmore 2 va Tampa and 1 or 2 va Boston sound like 99-100 win season !!!!!
@TommieLHHATL @tommieelee007 Yes lord

@BryanHoch It will b shortly !!!! üôèüèæ
8-1 should be a perfect time for Sheffield to make his MLB debut !!!
Before the Yankee BX Sawx series I said they could beat Boston n playoffs still believe that - haven‚Äôt seen Sale since June and nobody else on staff scares me at all
thought this was an interesting fun fact the yankees have the 6th best era n ‚öæÔ∏è &amp;  only behind houston - Tampa &amp; Boston n AL !!! Thought that was funny considering how much maligned  the staff has been !!!
@BryanHoch Tanaka has been on fire and Happ is inordinately good vs boston only makes sense !!!! Severino lined up for game 2 in boston If it exists
U gotta be fucking kidding me - is this not embarrassing that this is who represents us https://t.co/VsoFXJf7Eg
So the homie Plies got arrested n Tampa for having a gun n his carry on - I dunno whose packing these rappers bags these days but stupidity is reaching an all time high !!!! U cannot successfully sneak guns on ‚úàÔ∏è - how many will go down before I realize this

Do u bring Happ back - üôèüèæ  Do U bring CC back - ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   Do u bring back Lynn - üëéüèæ  Trade Gray -‚úåüèæ  Sheffield , Loisigna , German , Adams get shots n ST   Sign Corbin - üôèüèæüëåüèæüëçüèæ   Montgomery back - üöë
@realOconnor614 @JonathanMayo I guess if You break down like that , they wouldn‚Äôt have had Drury so basically you‚Äôre trading Happ for Solak &amp; Widener - ok I‚Äôll take it !!
I‚Äôm still pissed Yankees gave up Solak &amp; Widener n the Drury deal both r gonna be good @JonathanMayo

It is proverbs that remind ‚Äú Do not boast about tomorrow , as u don‚Äôt know what  a day may bring ‚Äú
Being completely honest I feel good bout the yankee rotation if the can Severino right   Tanaka WC   Happ 1   Severino 2   Tanaka 3   CC 4   I‚Äôd let happ go game 1 vs sale with Severino n 2 vs price

@_Lesbianne_ Totally different show not even comparable
@Beautyis_Disney Naw retired
Braves look good and ready for a deep playoff run - still need a run at JT This winter - the farm is everything and JT is still relatively young they need that catcher -
FYI empire comes on next that‚Äôs what I meant of course if U watch both then u know that - empire premieres this month that‚Äôs my point get a grip

I wonder does hoodie ,jacket weather ever hit Florida while the suns up ,or do I just keep that type attire n my trunk for after dark change ups ??
@JosinaAnderson Oh he watched today‚Äôs game like everyone else if so that comment wasn‚Äôt a stretch
@680TheFan the abraves need to take advantage of the Phillies semi collapse and create distance - need some breathing room going into the stretch run !!!
If CC isn‚Äôt perfect he‚Äôs not good at all !!!
@Jesse__Foster Only a damn fool with Sanchez upside would want light hitting Romine and quite frankly his catching prowess is overrated
Next question I need answers for - does he layman ever watch men‚Äôs tennis I mean I know they make more money but when Serena is not on the TV screen does the non enthusiast actually watch ??
So let me rephrase this for he peanut gallery - KAP gets Nike 30th anniversary look so apparently the NFL kneeling - Presidential SOB boycott is over ??!!

@JonathanMayo @realOconnor614 @MLBPipeline @DylanCease @whitesox @scottmerkin @BhamBarons @WSDashBaseball @KnightsBaseball @Intimidators @gfvoyagers Thinking Results King is def comparable but stuff wise people would say Cease is a better prospect - my guess is king jumps up the Yankee 30 prob / maybe top 12-15 maybe even top 10 but not topüíØ overall until he kills 3A next season and minimum 2 out pitches
@BleacherReport Slowly but surely getting back !!!

Not sure it‚Äôs wise that the guy u chose to be the anti KAP would‚Äôve n fact been the first to kneel had he not been killed by friendly gun fire &amp; had the incident covered up by the government- just saying #PatTillman
Lol @CoryBooker is acting up good to c the Dems finally stand up and fight the way they should‚Äôve been for quite some time now - document leaks why care if u have nothing to hide - no national security In question just a cover up
@BNightengale Yeah what he did when he was healthy
So apparently u can hit homers &amp;. need Tommy john - Otani with 2 tonight after being told he can‚Äôt pitch anymore and suggested TJ

@altamuramarc @iamMaddieMey Guaranteed they recover
@JonathanMayo any word on who has been promoted within the minors Yankees Double &amp; Triple A teams are still active Im sure Abreau - Florial - Garcia have been promoted amongst others
In case u thought Nike was moving blindly - thanks @iamMaddieMey https://t.co/navsTyi3sT
@680TheFan If they didn‚Äôt give him a shoe that would be horrible marketing &amp; def not capitalizing on the aforementioned endorsement deal and we both know based on this deal Nike is both strategic &amp; in tune the Kaps 7 would / will be iconic &amp; rival the adidas Yeezy !!
Imagine this team for a second -  C-Sanchez  1b - Andujar  2b - Torres  3b -Machado  SS - didi  Lf - Gardner / Frazier  Cf - Hicks  Rf - Judge  DH -Stanton   Man I can dream can‚Äôt I
@altamuramarc Might b right
Race for the rotation next season gonna b crazy , locks r Severino &amp; Tanaka with CC on petite 1yr cycle do they bring back Happ ?? or let Losigna - Sheffield - adams - Acevedo - Cessa - Swanson - king fight it out not to mention at some point Montgomery comes back

Ok Keith I‚Äôm back lol yesterday we discussed Garcia but apparently today Abreau threw 5 no hit innings n Trenton &amp; Mike King has turned into a beast in Scranton , I know ur high on Albert but what about King has he morphed into something special or all quad A hyperbole
Yes indeed 3 day weekends rock - rolls over closes eyes !!!
@JonHeyman Common bro really r we really even pushing this narrative othani def hasn‚Äôt done what Andujar or torres for that matter have done - stop it

Serena Williams is amazing ok back to ya Sunday evening !!!
I love Miguel Andujar think he‚Äôs ROY and gonna be a perennial all star but he has NO range at third
@680TheFan Need him back ASAP he fortifies the back end of that bullpen
Without Corbin or Kershaw - Yankees rotation next season should be   Severino -pre arb  Tanaka -2 yrs left  Happ - one year reup might get more elsewhere lettem walk  CC - one year reup  Loisigna - rookie  Sheffield - rookie  German -
Today‚Äôs news Yankees suck Nadal is gonna win a tough one Serena comes in at 3:30 - Acuna is a beast and Tiger is playing decent today 6 off be lead thru 14 you‚Äôre welcome
Is t Johnny Loisigna back why am I watching Lance Lynn struggle vs the Tigers
@Htxbia Called love ‚ù§Ô∏è
As it stands today I‚Äôd rather play Boston before houston and especially before a healthy Josh Donaldson added Clev - Boston is good no doubt but they don‚Äôt scare anyone pitching is mediocre beside Sale and he‚Äôs never healthy
@ColombianFash Make it 11
Heard Ems new album yet ?? What‚Äôs the good word ??
@JackCurryYES Do u think this was a good trade with Clint starting his rehab assignment ??
Mcutchen hmm Avelino wasn‚Äôt gonna play &amp; Depaula is a 4 at best right now , so I guess giving up 23-26 prospects doesn‚Äôt kill ya but damn what does this say bout Judge @ Frazier being healthy - can‚Äôt imagine this being done if Clint was on way back wouldn‚Äôt make sense would it
Yankees blow lead Red Sox come back sounds about right !!!
Damn Dellin !!! Blew the save &amp; the game all in less then 12 pitches smh - meanwhile Boston Losing to Miami !!!!
@JonathanMayo woooow this Michael King kid is pretty damn good threw  6 innings of 0 hit ball today &amp; is looking like a future 3 @ minimum a couple more tics which the Yankees have been known to help with  - ya thoughts

Games against the Orioles shouldn‚Äôt be this hard

So Vince Carter is still hanging on In the A smh
@Joelsherman1 Does anyone care

@MercedesBenz Bro nobody cares bout all that just tell me when the 19 wagon comes out this is getting ridiculous
@Jess_Nneka @Bossip I‚Äôm sure she has all kinds of mascara and stuff left over for problems such as these
Not ok with Kopech using the N word but in its context it‚Äôs defendable as was bisbuse of Gay don‚Äôt think either was in a racist or homophobic rant - this is ya 1 free pass killa
@SdotJoe Lol they don‚Äôt have to beat them all just 3 of them mariners won‚Äôt be around Red Sox don‚Äôt scare me at all I wish they could play them n WC now clev ,houston &amp; Oakland playing like they have been make me nervous -the question is will Oakland crash and burn in sept
@SdotJoe I live n Decatur Ga &amp; u can soon catch me on Wfan talking braves - hawks , UGA , sec sports &amp; kennesaw state hoops with that Said Yanks will be fine I prefer a slump now &amp; hit stride n Sept / October they‚Äôll come together but am i nervous yes - 1 Game playoff should scare anyone
@KINGROME12 Lol expectations matter bro can he live up to the pick - huerter is 6‚Äô7 can shoot lights out and will sneak up on people think ball &amp; kuzma dynamic
@TommieLHHATL Ready for sessions 1-3
Thinking bout hawks basketball üèÄ call me crazy but Kevin huerter is gonna have a better year then Trey young
@yaboy1878 U just made my point CC is ya number 4
@yaboy1878 Over who Happ is the best pitcher Severino is ya ace unless he looks nasty n coming weeks he could lose his spot and Tanaka is Tanaka
Man wtf is Aaron Boone doing seriously - he makes so many bad moves it‚Äôs comical - seriously mark my words the playoffs will be a disaster if they get by the 1 Game playoff - he will be out coached severely
@JackCurryYES ummm common Jack why is Chance Adams n a 5-3 game ??? I mean why outbthat type pressure on the kid ??
@yaboy1878 U can‚Äôt go CC or tanka homie never gonna happen and Evoaldi looked good first couple games been getting shelled last few
@Conner65449298 Good thing about being grown
@JackCurryYES is Robertson available &amp; why is Kaye acting like the Yankees can‚Äôt use everyone n the pen when tomorrow is an off day - kahnle - holder - Betances should all be available
Fuck guess u can‚Äôt compliment Lance Lynn fuck he gave up a 4 spot to the marlins Smh
Does everyone still think the Evoaldi trade was a better look then Happ or Lynn ?? If playoffs started today out respect CC gets Game 4 but Lynn will get a game 1 Happ or Severino 2 Happ or Severino 3 Tanaka 4 CC 5 Lynn
Atl Braves Acuna hands down rookie of the year n NL and NY Yankees Andujar in the AL -
@JackCurryYES Neither Britton or Robertson have looked good Britton has actually looked bad think it should be Betances
@hazelebaby ü§î
Where is all that Nathan Evoildi chitter chatter now - best pick up , turned the corner , pitching like a top of the rotation guy stop he‚Äôs Nathan evoldi
Yankees going down like flys - I imagine betances will b closing for immediate future
@BlkAshli Dunno bout that
Yankees should b ashamed of themselves !!!!
@BravesRadioNet @680TheFan @Jim_Powell Finally a Dansby sighting
@BlkAshli Yup they need him
Where is all that Nathan Evoildi chitter chatter now - best pick up , turned the corner , pitching like a top of the rotation guy stop he‚Äôs Nathan evoldi
This is the Yankees time to make some ground including tonight next 6 vs Miami &amp; Bmore gotta take all 6 5 minimum while Sawx are n clev &amp; Tampa
Deivi Garcia is the truth @keithlaw pitched great again today after winning FSL player of the week
Shits hitting the fan in the dumpy trumpy admin now senate acting at break neck speed to solidify his Supreme Court nomination - shot gets funnier by the day - if for no other reason at least pretend to care about America
@TommieLHHATL Got u !!!
Even after being swept the Braves r back in first cuz the Phillies have been even worse !!!
I gotta get in a JLo &amp; Alex relationship. ,  seriously if you don‚Äôt have that u don‚Äôt have anything !!!!
@HonElihuSmails @BrendanKutyNJ Not like he‚Äôs lying - we all know Bird is better at first then Austin but Austin is no slouch and if hot when hott he can put up numbers the Yankees would like to finally see outta Bird
@SNstats If people knew About him from his minor league days they‚Äôd know he‚Äôs always been a great SeCond half player
@keithlaw All is relative my friend I don‚Äôt necessarily agree but most would say they don‚Äôt make millions to play a  game or in ‚öæÔ∏è case half mill before arbitration
‚Äú Ballers ‚Äú was dope tonight !!!
@680TheFan This sweep really hurt Atl this was a chance for some separation with Mets &amp; Sawx beating up on Philly but instead they lost ground !!!
No ‚Äú Power ‚Äú but ‚Äú Ballers ‚Äú alive &amp; well so the nights not a total loss !!!!
Why no power tonight ??
I like JA Happ n the WC  game vs Oak or Houston or Game 1 if Severino gets locked in and gets the WC call !!!   Happ - Severino - Tanaka - CC - Lynn   Severino - Happ - Tanaka - CC - Lynn   Tanaka - Happ - severino - CC -Lynn   WC &amp; division series which rotation u going with ??

@680TheFan Sucka move kids done nothing wrong didn‚Äôt deserve that JT should be expecting some chin music ASAP
@JonathanMayo How do you feel about Nolan Martinez is he the real deal if healthy ?? He‚Äôs been pitching well this season .....
Everyone‚Äôs worries about Judge coming back n 3 weeks 1 the Yankees aren‚Äôt catching the sawx (2) As or mariners aren‚Äôt that good (3) everyone get healthy for the September run go into playoffs hot n good shape and they‚Äôll be fine
@hazelebaby I wanna put that tummy on swole
@Braves @680TheFan Fun !!!
@swbrailriders @JackCurryYES  Sheffield was pulled at 1-2/3 innings after giving up 4 runs - not injured right ??
@keithlaw I know pizza is the topic but Sheffield was pulled at 1-2/3 innings after giving up 4 runs - not injured right ??
@ralphieaversa @JackCurryYES @PinstripeLanes Love &amp; hip hop meets yes meets my guy from syracuse doing big things n the city of dreams
@JackCurryYES Damn , yeah I missed it rushing home got home mid 1st
I repeat in this very moment 3.5 games up in the first WC spot 5. Up in second does Happ get the ball ???
So in this very moment does JA Happ pitch game one or wild card ??  @JackCurryYES
1 word to describe Acuna Jr. Woooooooow 3 straight lead off dinger 5 straight games NL rookie of the year over Soto
Yankees 74-44 &amp; Mets 50-66 split subway series and u wonder why Boston  has a 10 game lead
Mets haven‚Äôt scored 7 runs In 2 weeks but that have 7 tonight thru 7 !!!! unbelievable
Def wanted today‚Äôs yankee game to be rained out !!!!! Don‚Äôt feel so confident
PGA tour ratings up 20 pct this weekend - all Tiger all day as previously stated a hand written letter to him saying ‚Äú thanks ‚Äú changes , transcends the sport like nobody else ever has
@680TheFan He deserves it has had a total turn around this season with his control &amp; stuff was always ridiculous
Ohhhhh yeah ‚Äú ballers ‚Äú is back !!!!!!
@NYY1996BR @AndrewMarchand Exactly what he was saying and everyone knew that but for asshole reasons acted like the comment didn‚Äôt make sense made all the sense in the world
@mortgageguyforu Facts
@altamuramarc No punctuation on twitter it‚Äôs a run on lifestyle
I repeat golf is a different animal with üêØ üêÖ healthy &amp; playing well !!!!
Has no range can‚Äôt play the corner def can‚Äôt play up the middle
@JackCurryYES what Michael Kay just said was the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard n quite some time - one day doesn‚Äôt make u hott as if anyone could be hott w/obplaying multiple days
Here‚Äôs my suggestion miguesl Andujar pick up a first basemen‚Äôs glove this winter when he goes back to the Dominican
@slutsaucekhloe Sexy
Stanton ‚Äú is this the run u been waiting for are u not entertained !!!!! ‚Äú
@shaunking @TheLatifah Wtf  was playboy thinking
Lol facts right facts tho
Howd Kay not mention Sanchez just now ,he came up late totally crushed everyone prob shouldve won Rookie of the year over Fullmer -then judge comes up wins now Andujar &amp; torres 1 &amp; 2 - that‚Äôs not even mentioning Gamel rooking year with Seattle was a yankee prospect @JackCurryYES
@Vinman23 @JackCurryYES No maybe u need to check his number over the last 25 + games
Just a quick point all the people talking about how good Evoaldi has been n Boston u do know Lynn has been just as good in NY right ??!!!!  @JackCurryYES
@LILPIXIE29 And Yo lil don‚Äôt go with ya fat ass and u should never take a pixie ever wit yo ugly ass - always the ugly fat ones do the most chirping
The PGA tour should write Tiger Woods a hand written Thank u letter because w/o him the casual person could give a shit about Golf !!!!!!
@ImTheResilient1 Dumbest shit I heard tonight
@MisssAmberROSE Wtf does that mean ??
Looking like Touki Touissant the most upside of any of the brave pitchers on the farm is getting called up for the double header !!! Congrats homie
@jwerz @kevin_brownnn @JackCurryYES I would still want a guy who is 329/380/557 in his last 22 to be in there.
@Yankeesboy26 @JackCurryYES Not about fans wanting him out here it‚Äôs about the alternative and yes he is hitting now so why not ride the hot bat
@JackCurryYES Yeah a lefty with a 4.54 era not like he‚Äôs facing sale just don‚Äôt get it
@MG_eaglelion @JackCurryYES Bottom line u don‚Äôt hit 2 homers and sit down for Voit batting mid 300s lately and finally getting ya timing down and confidence up
@MG_eaglelion @JackCurryYES Make sure u have this energy tonight when he‚Äôs 0-4 with 3ks with his 190 average becoming 160
@jwerz @JackCurryYES If u think the guy and his philosophy have the Yankees 30 over ur crazy and not really baseball savy the Yankees have won many games in spite of the coaching and yes I watch them all
Can u explain Boone &amp; this mentality I have a switch hitter thats red hott just hit 2 homers yesterday &amp; I sit  him today - I just can‚Äôt understand this guy &amp; his philosophy he backs up first just fine as well  @JackCurryYES
Already short handed with injuries to Sanchize &amp; Judge &amp; a terrible x &amp; o manager now he‚Äôs handicapping the team with lineups as well unbelievable
This is what I mean when I say Boone is a terrible manager again a lineup with Robinson -Romine &amp; walker in it -  just because he escaped last night doesn‚Äôt mean do it again - Stanton should be n right If torres needs a day it should be a half day !!
@CNN Well he said what they all are thinking don‚Äôt think this is surprising in the least bit
@keithlaw Lil hard on sauer who has admittedly been n a Lil slump but he‚Äôs better the The game u saw I‚Äôm sure of it
Thought of the day ‚Äú never say anything behind me u wouldn‚Äôt say  in front of or next to me ‚Äú !!!
@UnitedWhofans No I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt play Romine - walker - Robinson on the same day ever
Morning world
Disappointed in ‚Äú Suits ‚Äú tonight !!!
@longislanddon @JackCurryYES Walker should be on the team he‚Äôs playing well Robinson - Voit shouldn‚Äôt be sniffing MLB right now Torreyes &amp; Wade can come up for them as walker continues to back up first Wade get reps n OF when Stanton needs break &amp; Torreyes backs up IF
@Flech_Tera What they shoulda done was give him 4milli last year to rehab &amp; kept him from going to Tampa n the first place
@jomanado Didi gets half day DH , Stanton n right &amp;  walker at second would‚Äôve been more formidable !!! never a lineup with Robinson - Romine &amp; walker on same day !!!!
@jomanado Don‚Äôt care about days off Judge is hurt Sanchize is hurt &amp; can‚Äôt have Romine - Walker &amp; Robinson in the lineup at same time
@UnitedWhofans And when u say who do I want how bout starters for one or u just replying to reply
Don‚Äôt care about days off Judge is hurt Sanchize is hurt &amp; can‚Äôt have Romine - Walker &amp; Robinson in the lineup at same time
Wtf is with Boone and these lineups Yo he‚Äôs a terrible manager seriously terrible Yankees can‚Äôt have romine - Robinson and walker n lineup
@JonHeyman How crazy is that ??
Severino really bad lately   Tanaka  really good lately   Happ - should be better here then n Toronto only 5-6 quality outta him won‚Äôt be pushed like n Toronto with bad bullpen   CC - if not perfect on corners &amp; up and down he‚Äôll get smashed    Lynn - workhorse should be aight
@JackCurryYES at some point u gotta start taking AJ Cole serious so far no high leverage situations but he‚Äôs pitching to a 1.75 he‚Äôs an  ex bit tyme prospect so obviously he was respected at one point - maybe that Adam warren role for now ??
Yankee fans like Lynne is the ace we been looking for - lol - pump the breaks but he did look good tonight coulda used him n Beantown
@keithlaw shoulda went to c D Garcia &amp; his 7 Perfect tonight instead of Matty Sauer - the just turned 19 yr old pitching n high A today was prob called up for the second half of double dip &amp; prob sticks around now what u think ??
@JonathanMayo guessing D. Garcia will make next weeks team of the week just turned 19 yr old n Tampa hi A today pitched a perfect 7 inning game 94 pitches !!!!
@keithlaw @SIYanks Yikes no bueno I prefer Whitlock  , Garcia - Medina - Abreau ,Contreras but I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôll shut them down and end 6 innings and them same 2 runs allowed
@keithlaw @SIYanks I dunno isbthat good or bad ??
So hold up Safaree messed with well nevermind  - hey @JoeBudden ummmmm am i seeing what I think I‚Äôm seeing in this TV screen
@Skysymone___ I dunno know u so let‚Äôs keep it simple
@chartdata What history does Nicki &amp; Trey have y‚Äôall sayinfbrheaw numbers were because of her and how did CIARA get n this convo
Yankee fans take solace in knowing the Sawx will not maintain this pace - it virtually impossible &amp; rest assured the As aren‚Äôt that good either but the Yankees do need another run 35 - 18 run will have them back in the mix at the end
A lil pool action today https://t.co/39LMcIbUGY
How‚Äôd y‚Äôall feel about ‚Äú Power‚Äù tonight ???
@noemadnyc Thank u my brother !!!
Waffle House !!!!!
@FamousBirthdays Thank I for the well wishes
Yankees suck no other way around that maybe they‚Äôll be good again tomorrow or next week but since the break they‚Äôve sucked period
Yeah wild card it see u n September cuz this AL east race is over boston prob won‚Äôt collapse
Chance Adams had a decent game not great decent 3 runs over 5 I can live with but if u score 0 ur gonna lose 100 pct of the time - don‚Äôt tell me they don‚Äôt need Judge &amp; Sanchize n the lineup watching Romine &amp; Shane whatever hurts
Wild card it is !!!! Yankees look like a  terrible miserable team - it‚Äôs a long season every team has slumps but not sure they can turn around 7.5 games against boston then have adams going tomorrow very well could lose all 4 but hoping for a split
Looks like the braves have the third baseman of the future !!!! Camargo the truth !!!!!!
All the Sanchize chitter chatter has romine caught a runner stealing this year - whatever happened to Gray being Gary‚Äôs fault lotta live service but time told the truth
Boone is botching this up terribly defending plays - players blaming others etc etc botching this up big time !!! He‚Äôs terrible like really terrible
@BenBadler I‚Äôm amgueasi g cuz u didn‚Äôt say a number next to his name he wasn‚Äôt a top 30 or 50 kid
@TommieLHHATL üëã
Actually the only thing I watch on WE Tv is CSI Miami reruns !!!!
@daze11 Not trading him
@BNightengale Lethal today killa not everyday I‚Äôd take yankee top 9 over Sox top 5 any day - when healthy Gardner - Judge - Stanton - Didi - Sanchize - torres - Andujar - Bird - Hicks
@MLBPipeline @MLB @jimcallisMLB @JonathanMayo @AJCassavell @scottmerkin @gregorMLB @BryanHoch @m_sheldon @RhettBollinger Is this top ten ranking including the new international kids
@robinlundberg Everyone does realize season series is 5-5 I dunno that seems pretty equal
@ace078 Indeed -point made , that easily kinda disgusting how the  ole boy network treats men of color n the üèà
@MistyHPettway08 @EAMaddenNFL @Kaepernick7 Lip service people def won‚Äôt stop something they want for the cause - Tv still on everyone‚Äôs tv sunday afternoons
Braves u have my undivided attention !!!!
Total collapse very disappointed in the Yankees in good c u n October hopefully they don‚Äôt freeze up &amp; move on I‚Äôm not so confident
FYI this is the one they needed to Chris Sale Game against a random reliever type but prob not gonna get it now , advantage boston
Yankees suck bro plain and simple not watching this shit - I swore they were better then boston after tonight I dunno - boston looks like the better team plain and simple
Wtf is holder thinking then Andujar can throw a strike home - ya seriously the Yankees play bad baseball at times like wtf is with this brain freeze shit
Shoulda started CC in this inning bottom of order Boone is a terrible manager so far !!!!!!
Outrage over Kaeps name being taken out of video game song EA puts it back n - is it too late or y‚Äôall cool with the apology and reinstatement
@IamPeterGunz Very unfair
@JonathanMayo how bout Nolan Martinez today 5 innings 0 hits 0 walks 7ks - he needs to be promoted to Charleston asap wasting his time pitching to a 1.23 - 8 games n Staten isle
Damn I want üåÆ üõé !!!
@MiLB Way to much time on hands
@AndrewMarchand Black Thursday coming soon unfortunately- no breaking new just copying stories internet plagiarism
@_Smoke_Saunders @darenw @JesseSanchezMLB @MLBPipeline top 2 or 3 Gms n the game &amp; Yankees have about 4-5 kids at lower levels that will be top 100 coming soon
@Moneyman4lyfe_ @Stoooopsy @fzlongotoon @BenGoldenthal @darenw @MLBPipeline Guzman was top 100 by who ?? He will be but hasn‚Äôt been yet !!
@CrystalVTyson I‚Äôve seen studies that say 20 pct less attractive so I dunno thisbis debatable ‚Äú Uber fact ‚Äú
@680TheFan He‚Äôs a beast man Braves r set up for a long time - dunno what to make of dansby seems kinda regular right now but as this team grows I guess ok and steady is not a bad thing
Yes in Didi - in Didi we trust etc etc 3 run bomb n top of first CC has breathing room !!!!!
Braves have a top 3 farm system with 2 - 1st round pics n next years draft a top ten for not signing anyone this year and a hi teen lower 20 depending on how they finish this season !!!
What a day for pitching on the Yankee farm - Sheffield  n 3A - Stephan n 2A - R Garcia n HiA- Nolan Martinez n Staten Isle &amp; l Medina n Pulaski woke big day
@ADipichiwitz so r we ok with the Dansby Swanson experiment being over ? Or are u ok with the left side as is for a championship run ?
@ADipichiwitz Def not just fine he‚Äôs a kid could def get better but defensive metrics &amp; almost avg offense don‚Äôt make it just fine when they have a farm that could get them better not to mention Swanson is worse at SS so take ya pick
@MLBPipeline @JesseSanchezMLB @Yankees @BryanHoch @swbrailriders @TrentonThunder @TampaTarpons @ChasRiverDogs @PulaskiYanks @SIYanks whose the bird kid they announced I only c 2 names
@Flech_Tera Facts hopefully next turn thru he will get this slot
@YankeesPR @BaseballAmerica @MLBPipeline But that‚Äôs only 2 names said they announced signing 3 kids
@parhamproducti1 Aaron Boone sucks as a coach
@misstaraashley @HotAdultModels The fact that a bully douchebag has u contemplating means he orbshe has already won
@jorgecastillo Always something with these guys - it‚Äôs ashame cuz they actually have some talent
@JosinaAnderson Wasn‚Äôt misunderstood his reply was thought out and rehearsed don‚Äôt recant now or play the misunderstood card own that shit Uncle Sam I mean dak
@JosinaAnderson Ok we‚Äôre friends again Brian Reece told me b nice 2 u !
@wesleysnipes @drocktrot Weeeeeeees
@JornielMora_NYC @JesseSanchezMLB @Yankees Just added to mlb list recently &amp; not on baseball America list Im Wondering why maybe he wasn‚Äôt eligible to sign and damn 2.5 is a lot for the kid
@Rick12_85 @JesseSanchezMLB Well spending 2.5 on Vargas I imagine not much
@JesseSanchezMLB how‚Äôd Kid not on ant top 50 lists get 2.5 million from the Yankees at this late date
@JonathanMayo damn guess my question was answered Alexander Vargas for 2.5 pretty much has to conclude the intl spending wooooow 2.5 was he worth that type money sheesh
@keithlaw damn guess my question was answered Alexander Vargas for 2.5 pretty much has to conclude the intl spending wooooow 2.5 was hecworth that type money
@JesseSanchezMLB @MLBPipeline So I‚Äôm assuming that concludes the intl signing for the Yankees 2.5 woooow they must think he‚Äôs the damn second coming of Franny Lindor
@JesseSanchezMLB  who has the most intl bonus pool money left to sign Victor 2xs r the Yankees stockpiling money for him or someone else ??
@keithlaw  who has the most intl bonus pool money left to sign Victor 2xs r the Yankees stockpiling money for him or someone else
@jimcallisMLB who has the most intl bonus pool money left to sign Victor 2xs f the Yankees stockpiling money for him or someone else
@victorvmesa @MLBPipeline Yankees new prospect when he‚Äôs able to sign
I know it hasn‚Äôt been great competition but don‚Äôt look now Tanaka looks good os shall I say dominant only 6 runs over last 30 innings @JackCurryYES
Ok @JonathanMayo with Otani slowing to a crawl after the injury whose AL rookie of year I‚Äôm going Andujar right now - how bout u ??
@JonathanMayo Agreed woulda traded him instead
Coming along quite nicely https://t.co/sUHmtDJ8sW
All these mofos leaving the AL east they Yankees have no excuse not to run the table -Baltimore &amp; Tampa send everyone away and Toronto sent the Yankees the best piece they possessed - no excuses
@JonathanMayo just heard u on mlb - who do u like more since neither is a specialist and would work both R&amp;LHB Carrol or Kahnle
Kendrick killed it for sure !!!! #power
Don‚Äôt let Newcombs1 bitter distract u from the Oralia trade Brad Brach to the Atlanta Braves for 250k Intl bonus money -what r the orioles gonna do with bonus money
@leeeesssi @iamjzapal Stop being messy Bitch and don‚Äôt at nobody from my page Jhonni know I‚Äôm not talking bout her
Bitch don‚Äôt post them old ass pics of me acting like they‚Äôre new !!!!!
@Chocola28299621 @MalaysiaPargo That would be amazing hook it up
Follow my IG @richiedollaz
@TommieLHHATL Fuck it just shoot for üíØ
Braves need a third basemen and def have the pitching Tx covets - seems like a good deal for Beltre who‚Äôd wave his no trade for another playoff run
@JackCurryYES @JesseSanchezMLB Wow 2 Cuban kids Victor victor&amp; Rodriguez  or naw ??
@Feinsand So if that‚Äôs the case why not put him on 40 and let someone else go ??? Yankees mustn‚Äôt have thought he was the best arm in upper levels - especially with Robertson  about to b a FA
@YankeesPR @Yankees So with the 2 recent trades how much have they accumulated in Intl bonus money
@JonHeyman How much did they get In the first trade ?? 1.1 or am i weonfbon rhat number
@JackCurryYES wasn‚Äôt a top 30 guy but was okaying well - I imagine Yanks using  Shreve Kindy for Cuban pitcher Rodriguez - now piling up more intl money for victor Victor who should b eligible soon
If you‚Äôve lost contact w/girls from 10 years ago easiest way to find them ; post a new girl &amp; i guarantee they‚Äôll text  you ‚Äú piece of shirt ‚Äú , ‚Äú really asshole ‚Äú , ‚Äú fuck u prick ‚Äú  and u say hey babe I was just looking for you
I wonder if people realize typing long ass  negatively driven message takes more time then swiping left &amp; pushing delete
@Joelsherman1 Prob means they need to sign a couple of players &amp; kahnle is good to go
@BenBadler Finally Shreve gets a fresh start
And with that pitch Dave Robertson has fucked off yet another game - why does it matter what the schedule is if they continue to lose to bad teams anyway -just can‚Äôt lose to royals - mets - orioles &amp; rays
@hazelebaby Don‚Äôt let that distract u from where u should be ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòâ
@hazelebaby Everywhere but where u should be !!!
@JackCurryYES so the game isn‚Äôt on tv ??
@Joelsherman1 They have a great  outfield without Judge the key is finding a DH while Judge is down - lineup length takes a hit now with Sanchize hurt u have a weak 8-9 batter
Just think at this rate the Yankees won‚Äôt have to worry bout Judge and his injury or having any pitchers cuz all the games get rained out - now technically u can rest CC this turn thru the rotation- I dunno just an idea !!
@Ken_Rosenthal @DanHayesMLB Can they wait til after the boston series
Dry swings n a week back n action n 3 coulda been worse - yankees dodge bullet w/Judge injury - need Stanton to show up &amp; show but have enough offensive depth to cover even if he doesn‚Äôt - Andujar - Didi &amp; Bird hot right hopefully Hicks &amp; walker join the party
@billjamesonline And anyone would care why
@AP I‚Äôm guessing zuckerbergis back taking advice from Justin Timberlake instead of Spider-Man
@TampaTarpons Yet Whitlock is back n Tampa why ??
@YankeesPR Don‚Äôt really get Boone and the whole bench the player when he‚Äôs hot thing - I get days off but  Andujar is 23 &amp; hott pretty hard to justify !!!!  Romine I guess is necessary
@majorrichie11 @RetardoMachado @YankeesPR @swbrailriders When Britton plays a couple games and kahnle presses the issue n Scranton
@DaNickster79 Facts I saw that
Meanwhile poor Tommy Khanle has been banished to Scranton - definition of sugar 2 shit
Severino - Tanaka - CC - Happ &amp; Gray quite frankly not opposed to giving the ball to Gray outside the BX do ya due diligence he‚Äôs actually not bad away from home , Cessa - German - Sheffield - Loisigna real losers here
@chadjennings22 Yeah it‚Äôs never been the same for him since he splayed for the Indiana pacers lol jk
@yanksguy30 @JackCurryYES Agreed as I‚Äôve said not really an issue with a blocked 3b &amp; a blocked rule 5 OF going to Toronto for a 35 yr old rental that ur not gonna want back it‚Äôs the original Drury deal added to this deal now it becomes Solak - widener - mckinney - Drury for Happ no bueno
I have no issues with Drury which should‚Äôve been enough going to Toronto with McKinney a blocked OF , who was rule 5 - my issue lies with getting Drury n first place for widener &amp; solak then sending him off with McKinney for a 35 yr old rental pitcher @JonathanMayo
@BaseballAmerica Good let‚Äôs c him n ya top 100 come January
@Nicolem49725364 Baseball ‚öæÔ∏è
@DanCovello @JackCurryYES Doubt that n 18 months machado will be manning third
@JackCurryYES @JonHeyman @Joelsherman1 @Feinsand Wow a lot for a pitcher excuse me rental pitcher with a plus 4 era
@AndrewMarchand
@BNightengale @JonHeyman Im Sure he was being sarcastic I think ü§î
ü§î duno know how I feel bout Happ trade - McKinney rule 5 clears roster space blocked @ MLB level , Drury also blocked with Andujar &amp; Torres gets to go somewhere &amp; play I guess @ second Donaldson prob out after season - could‚Äôve done better then rental pitcher @JackCurryYES
@Fertorr92 @JonHeyman Def just Drury &amp; McKinney no sp
@JonHeyman So Drury &amp; Mckinney for Happ hmmmm don't think I like that for a rental especially since both Drury &amp; McKinney are major league ready
@beeBeKING Never left
@JonHeyman Silly move he isn‚Äôt gonna help them anymore then Sheffield would - Drury should hold more value then a rental
@Disney1992World @JasonKime @Feinsand @Joelsherman1 Agreed
@hazelebaby ü§î
@JonathanMayo @MLBPipeline I c u Really like Stephan &amp; Schmidt higher on yankee 30 then my preferred Sauer - Garcia &amp; Whitlock
@JonathanMayo Finally let‚Äôs compare and contrast
Yeah went up pitched well don‚Äôt understand why he went back down - went 5 no runs but had 5 walks
Morning  tweople
@CNN Truth can never be Defamation my friend
Don‚Äôt let all the bs in America distract you from the fact that ‚Äú suits ‚Äú is back on tonight
@Joelsherman1 As long as none of my top 15 r used I guess it‚Äôs fine - don‚Äôt really think he‚Äôs a difference maker
@rhansonx2 Am I not a big fan ?? Definitely am if he could stay on the field only 25 innings this year stuff is crazy but often hurt needs big second half
Yankee top 10 prospects   1 Sheffield - 2 Florial - 3 loisigna - 4 Abreau - 5 Acevedo - 6 Dgarcia - 7 Medina - 8 Whitlock - 9 sauer 10 F Perez   Outside - Pereira  - Schmidt - Nolan Martinez - Estrada -Adams
@BryanHoch Literally played game 100 today speak to me when 140 is n the books waaaay to early to stress but yes playing better and beating teams u should beat will help the cause
Deivi Garcia my number 9 yankee prospect dealt today n Tampa 6 inning 2 hits 0 walks 12ks 0 runs lowering his era 3.12 in Tampa as a just turned 18 yr old pay attention yankee fans !!!! @JonathanMayo
@MBStadium Roof is crazy but Mercedes can‚Äôt keep my 150k gwagon from leaking
Freaking sick !! https://t.co/HHTcro6IBB
Yankees are 6-6 against the Rays this season and 5-5 against the Orioles. The Red Sox are 9-4 vs. the Rays and, entering tonight's game in Baltimore, 10-2 vs. the Orioles.‚Äî fucking ridiculous utterly fucking ridiculous 11-11 vs 19-6 hmmm looking for them 6 games look no further
@nellithetiger Hmmm üëåüèæ
@Robfeliz Absolutely fucking ridiculous is right
@Matt_Agosta4 Agreed
@DSweetDaddy2348 Facts add orioles to the mix
Shouldn‚Äôt be this difficult for the Yankees , quite frankly doesn‚Äôt matter how easy the 2nd half schedule is if they can‚Äôt beat mediocre teams like the rays &amp; mets
Say what u wanna say Tekashi headed out with Nikki &amp; Future is an amazing look for him !!!!!
With this years gains Touki is prob the best pitching prospect in Brave system - just operating of pure stuff he was that last year - now it‚Äôs all coming together !!! @680TheFan
What a wasted year for Gary Sanchez literally was terrible when on the field and now hurt til August - smh wasted year
Coming back from break splitting with mets and losing series to Rays is disgusting - like seriously disgusting 2 Innings to figure this shit out
@careym74 So I‚Äôm guessing DL for a month isntonorotext his feeling ummm yeah u make alotta sense
@MiLB @ToukiToussaint @GoStripers @Braves @mlbbowman I‚Äôve said all along touki was the one gonna be an ace !!
If they can‚Äôt beat the rays w/o machado they have bigger problems my friend much bigger problems
@Feinsand Why do they keep mentioning Adams he‚Äôs not an option barely still n triple a rotation he sucks and sucked again today
Can‚Äôt be serious the Yankees can‚Äôt be serious down to Tampa - like seriously wake the fuck Up and handle ya biz
No Hicks again must be a lil banged up @JackCurryYES
@680TheFan They had the prospects can‚Äôt imagine that deal not getting done if they wanted him at all
@shevyclassick I‚Äôd be very surprised by that fake move
So Sanchize gets killed for not hustling ends up being hurt again - my bad Gary but u still cost yankees a game yesterday bro
@680TheFan Needed a sweep
@CNN Man stfu like seriously how much more can we take
@Chellev311 ü§î
@Chellev311 @Pinky808 üòâ
@drocktrot Dirt bag move ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
@Buster_ESPN Ima Sanchize Stan but can‚Äôt condone nor accept that definitely cost yankees that game - very selfish play , you‚Äôd think the way everyone else plays is contagious literally the only guy that doesn‚Äôt play the right way is him as evidenced by Hicks even making them go to 1st
@Buster_ESPN Disgusting
@BNightengale He needs to sit down for a while Girardi doesn‚Äôt look so crazy now does he and I‚Äôm the biggest Sanchize fan out here but tonight was unacceptable
If u can‚Äôt run or don‚Äôt wanna run don‚Äôt fucking play everyone knows I‚Äôm a Sanchize fan but common man seriously u can‚Äôt hurt the team like this - Hicks did all he could and u couldn‚Äôt even run the damn play out - not acceptable bro
@JackCurryYES never liked giving up the out on sac bunts puts added  pressure on next batter
How was L&amp;HH hollywood tonight ?? WTvhing yankee game &amp; brave game so I missed it or did I miss anything ??
A teams ace goes down right before the game so they bullpen it yet Severino looks like he should be the one sitting this one out - disappointment personified offense gotta come thru cuz Severino doesn‚Äôt have it at all
@KingZito973 Facts immediately just nothing out there worth giving up the farm for - prefer give Sheffield Acevedo and Loisigna when healthy them innings
All of a sudden Gincarlo Stanton is batting 283 with a 870 ops - I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs more like it
@JonHeyman What they got for a return ??
Blame that hanger on Sanchize 2 right
This can‚Äôt happen bro just can‚Äôt happen a loss to Tampa just can‚Äôt happen not here &amp; now like seriously Boston is legit running away with the division like üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üèÉüèæ
MIL- ATL- ARI- COL-PIT-STL- SF- WSH all within 5 games of Natl league WC - Braves need to win the division !!!
Ok now Severino is dealing changeup now slider
Braves need a sweep 2 outta 3 won‚Äôt do it  vs the marlins need all 3 while Nats got brewers &amp; Philly got La
Braves look good tonight gone be interesting seeing how they play this trade deadline  - this season reminds me of last seasons yankees - ahead of schedule do they mortgage the farm or stand pat with prospects
@MarcCarig Def didn‚Äôt have good stuff took 8 pitches and couldnt put away one batter and threw 24 in the inning
@thegooglefact As If I needed another reason to indulge the Golden Arches
Yankees won‚Äôt trade Acevedo - Frazier - Florial - Abreau or Sheffield for a rental at trade deadline !!! I‚Äôd add Loisigna - Medina - Whitlock - Sauer - D Garcia 2 that list - #norentals
Can‚Äôt stop won‚Äôt stop !!!! https://t.co/8k87I8iHUs
@680TheFan No they should use some of the elite pitching prospects on the farm as relievers
To Iranian President Rouhani: I AM UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OBSTRUCTION &amp; TREASON. I JUST MET WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT &amp; ATTACKED MY OWN GOVERNMENT WHILE SUPPORTING HIS. THEN I INVITED HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I NEED TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THAT SO I AM THREATENING YOU INSTEAD.
Wanna know why trump is president look no further then milwaukee Wisconsin baseball field Saturday night !!!! The base let‚Äôs u know how they felt - come to grips tweople America is racist
@Monae_inkz Yeah she fucked that up majorly
Yankees only place 1 player on prospectus &amp; Laws top 50 midseason lists Sheffield 40 &amp; 12 respectively - can‚Äôt disagree with the injuries but guessing Loisigna - Abreau , Perez &amp; Florial will find ways into bottom half
If you think Golf  isn‚Äôt a completely different sport with Tiger Woods healthy &amp; playing well you‚Äôre crazy !!!!!!
@tariqnasheed @colbycolb I‚Äôm blaming anyone of color that didn‚Äôt hold him accountable in the clubhouse period Lorenzo Cain we looking at u bro ...
Hader gets standing ovation for being a racist homophob in milwaukee guess that explains trump winning Wisconsin- kap can‚Äôt get a job in queens ny tho
Be a racist homophob get exposed for such say u sorry play the kid roll get standing ovation you da man now bro next step galvanize the base become president @keithlaw
@TommieLHHATL ü§îü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëéüèΩü§öüèæüôèüèΩ
Painting this scenario 4 @JackCurryYES Sheffield is lights out tonight - Cessa doesn‚Äôt pitch well but Yankees still win a shoot out - German remains n Scranton - next turn thru barring a trade for a pitcher I think it‚Äôs time to c what Sheffield has !!!
Gray pitches well no need for the Acevedo piggy back now Cessa comes up for Germans next turn in rotation and Acevedo goes back down to continue his madness n Trenton next week !!!!
Looking for hott music - send tracks &amp; full songs 2  - djrovedu@gmail.com hott stuff only please keep the bs !!!
Wanna hear me talk Braves - Hawks - Falcons - sec üèà we‚Äôll get ready I‚Äôll be on @680TheFan with a podcast as well coming soon !!!!
Yankees have 26 hits n the last 2 games yet a -1 run differential clutch hitting &amp; pitching has to be better then this !!!!!
@Ken_Rosenthal Ok is this money for next season or this one cuz I feel like everyone except Victor victor is signed already
@iam_dasirablack Lemme know when ur n atlanta !!
Shreve closes the game how bout that !!!!! Save #1
@Joelsherman1 A lil late for intl National money isn‚Äôt it - everyone of note is signed except maybe victor victor I imagine that‚Äôs the goal
Chapman really man wtf was that ??
Yankees or braves need international slot money I hear victor victor told me he‚Äôll be eligible for signing n next couple weeks
Just so u know it is 93 with a real feel of 104 in Miami today - just saying
Regardless of the outcome Sonny Gray pitched well today and I‚Äôll take that outting every time minus Dave Robertson shenanigans
If Sonny Gray would stop thinking on the mound so much he‚Äôd have better results - one thing to be cerebral yet another to be obsessive -I‚Äôd take today‚Äôs start every day of the week 5.1/3 - 1 run works for me left leading 4-1 !!!!
@TampaTarpons @TorresGleyber Why did Whitlock go back down had a good start n Trenton - help me understand that move
@lilu_moon @HotAdultModels ü§öüèæ
@nyknicks @NJHoopRecruit Wonder if he was throwing nutcrackers @ safaree last week
Preface by saying , I‚Äôm a big German fan wanna see him succeed even Said I thought his stuff was better then Montgomerys but until Loisigna gets back which will prob be never I think Cessa is earning a üëÄ ... he couldn‚Äôt be much worse
@MiLB Let‚Äôs not forget his 9+ era
I know everyone loves Louis  Medina but a 9era in Pulaski isn‚Äôt acceptable I don‚Äôt care how good they say his stuff obviously it isn‚Äôt translating he‚Äôs getting hit and has no control what so ever at that stage he should be dominating with 1 pitch @JonathanMayo
Where is Johnny Loisigna when u need him ??
Gonna be a long weekend in the Bronx and Boone is to blame - why would u start the back end of the rotation out the break I understand if you‚Äôre 4.5 up but not down all these games are premium especially against the mets big boys Friday &amp; Sunday
If the Yankees fall a few more games behind boston the WC will be the fate and no trades should be made this year for these bs players out here - nobody on the market is good enough to help the Yankees go to next level @AndrewMarchand
Meanwhile somewhere n the motor city Boston is prob  gonna pummel the üêÖ !!!
Didn‚Äôt  agree with the Yankees rotation out the gate when a strong start was essential why the hell we rocking with German &amp; Gray n first games back why @JackCurryYES why
Didn‚Äôt  agree with the Yankees rotation out the gate when a strong start was essential why the hell we rocking with German &amp; Gray n first games back
Smh here we go starting the second half with the same bullshit from German - if he can‚Äôt get it too fucking gether get his ass out the rotation &amp; I was an advocate for him over Montgomery from the door   4.5 down no room for bullshit
@bethanyxxxbenz I‚Äôm here
@680TheFan Austin Riley ready by mid August/  sept call up unless he falters n 3A , don‚Äôt expect maybe he‚Äôs the answer !!?? we‚Äôll c bout Alex Jackson just getting to 3A so questions have to be answered !!!
@680TheFan Braves need a beast 3b &amp; a start catcher that lineup is killa hold up Swanson better figure it out soon
@DritaDavanzo @drocktrot And you retweeted  this why ??
@nytimes Sweet add this to the millions of things that anyone else but trump would be criticized /crucified for but his base doesn‚Äôt seem to care
@JonHeyman @Fancred Always been baseball brilliant it‚Äôs the billy Martin isn‚Äôt him that‚Äôs the problem
@jjcoop36 He signed with Alabama already ??
@slutsaucekhloe Let‚Äôs c Pics sharing is caring
@JonathanMayo when do u guys update ya top üíØ &amp; top 30 team list
Clint Frazier was taken out the game &amp; triple A Scranton today after 1 AB - maybe an injury maybe traded waiting on detailsü§î@swbrailriders
@keithlaw with only Sheffield @ 12 on midseason top 50 were any other Yankees in consideration .. I know You liked Perez , Abreau &amp; Florial in the top üíØ any other Yankee kids creeping up - Medina - Acevedo - Whitlock - Sauer - D Garcia - Duran - Periera
@BleacherReport @wojespn As well he should not what you‚Äôre worth but what u negotiate , Football dudes gotta hate guaranteed contracts plus he goes to houston for vet minimum &amp; adds another 5 to that 28
@WFAN660 so Mello to the A i like that move removes alotta pressure from Collins &amp; Young - they shouldn‚Äôt waive him actually think he‚Äôd be invigorated and have a decent year n the weak east
@TommieLHHATL @tommieelee007 This pic right here tho ,definitely the money shot !!!!!!
@keithlaw do U do a mid season prospect top 100 ??
So trump got America out here looking crazy , weak and hypocritical !!! Dude picks fights , loud talks everyone but Putin ... if you‚Äôre the park bully but refuse to beef with the one kid in the sand box ,either you‚Äôre scared of him or you know he knows ya weakness ! Period
@hitmansteviej congrats my brotha congrats - happiness is everything right now !!!!
Not really understanding the Derozen for Leonard trade at all a does it make either team that much better &amp; he isn‚Äôt staying In Toronto didn‚Äôt even wanna go in the first place so it‚Äôs a rental that still doesn‚Äôt make u better then boston or Phil I dunno y‚Äôall tell me
@_crymearivera I feel like josh hader
The Josh Hader kid cant justify those tweets period -I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs 7‚Äì10-15 yrs  ago
@r_jessenia Damn You found a tweet from 13
@JonathanMayo so Garett Whitlock got promoted to Trenton a couple of good outings  n 2A &amp; he will have to enter that top 100 conversation with Deivi Garcia !!!
@jimcallisMLB so Garett Whitlock got promoted to double A a couple of good outings there he will have to enter that top 100 conversation with Deivi Garcia !!!
@altamuramarc @JackCurryYES I‚Äôm not so sure Anaheim is selling r u - trout free agency coming up fast is that the message you‚Äôre sending to the best player n baseball
@Nikki_Irish @slutsaucekhloe Damn I‚Äôm sorry won‚Äôt happen again
Yankees aren‚Äôt in the A all season
@S_Beasley @680TheFan Braves r this years yankees now do u go all in this year - best farm n the game would possibly no definitely net u Machado if so desired - NL is weak is this the year to load up ???
@680TheFan Big series for the braves coming back I expect the Nats to make a second half run &amp; I also believe the NL east will be easier to win then the WC with 5 teams within 5 games of both slots - Philly with the .5 game lead is where Braves eyes need to be set !!!!!
@Joelsherman1 He deserves a job for sure - binder joe is back
Disappointed in Yankees thought the desire to close first half strong would‚Äôve been greater - Bmore series as well as this clev series leaves a lot to be desired and going into the break down 5 3 n loss to Boston isn‚Äôt cool at all !!!!!
@RyanEvans29 @JackCurryYES Very that‚Äôs key #1 winning the games they‚Äôre supposed to because ur right clearly 5-5 against a team 40 under 500 unacceptable
@altamuramarc @JackCurryYES That‚Äôs not a key when the starters on the market suck
@680TheFan Dealin
@TommieLHHATL I mean if u lookin in the circus Dont get mad when u find clowns
@TommieLHHATL Naw I still follow u
@BryanHoch @RailRidersTT Lol classic
Yankee keys for second half @JackCurryYES   1 -beat the teams they‚Äôre supposed too much easier second half schedule take advantage   2 -Tanaka must be Tanaka whoever that Tanaka is   3 -Sanchize / Bird come alive   4 - id like to say Gray figure it out but think that‚Äôs a wrap
@RailRidersTT @BryanHoch Even tho he‚Äôs still pre arb is he still responsible for the fancy spread - steak lobster &amp; such ??
@FunkyFreshEzE @MaxWildstein Eye test says he make routine plays but as much as I like Miguel‚Äôs bat he‚Äôs a staue at third no doubt
@680TheFan How the Braves close the first half should determine if they should buy sell or just wait til free agency - they def have some money to spend so next season could be a big one of some prospects step forward hey Touki
@680TheFan Tough one always loved him since he was n yankee system years back
All of me says Manny makes that play but it was a tough one more about footwork then the actual throw - thinking he may have been safe anyway but if he doesn‚Äôt sit back on hop innings over machado charges that ball @JackCurryYES
@FunkyFreshEzE @MaxWildstein All of me says he does even tho we could be wrong that was a tough one more about footwork then the actual throw - thinking he may have been safe anyway but if he doesn‚Äôt sit back on hop innings over machado charges that ball
@680TheFan let‚Äôs congratulate my guy Touki on being selected to Futures Game - might have be having the best season of any of the Atl pitching prospects in minors - seems to have figured it out
@MLBPipeline @SIRIUSXM @AllStarGame @_YoSoy_Touki @Braves @mlbbowman @GoStripers @mbraves @FireFrogsBB @TheRomeBraves @DanvilleBraves Touki has had a breakout year might b the best prospect stuff wise in minors for Atl
So Tyler Clippard is gonna haunt the Yankees until he no longer does - I can c this will be problematic
@Feinsand Reminiscent of his yankee career
I still have faith in Serena don‚Äôt @ me til it‚Äôs over !!!   Thanks
I got Serena for the win !!!
100+ criminal counts 35 total indictments 32 people indicted 3 companies indicted 5 guilty pleas Paul Manafort in jail Michael Flynn guilty Trump told Russia to hack Trump staff met with Russians Trump Jr. worked w/Wikileaks  This is not a witch hunt. It‚Äôs a criminal conspiracy.
@680TheFan All depends if they think this is the year if not keep the prospects and try in free agency - all about being self aware are they better then the Nats - diamondbacks- dodgers - cubs - brewers - and even Phillies for that matter
@JackCurryYES Damn the all star game who cares but now that we all realize he sucks im guessing we can take him off the Yankee wish list
@BryanHoch Couple that with his record and I‚Äôll  take that everyday of the week and twice on Sundays
Todays new 12 Russian indicted for interfering with US Elections , Trump not wanted in England and is about to be in deep shit here in America makes Monday‚Äôs sumsmit very interesting
@JoeBudden Stop it joe
@mlbtraderumors Well apparently he doesn‚Äôt wanna be traded lol
@680TheFan No Freddie noooooo
@slutsaucekhloe Your welcome at least day my name
Trump said again this morning that the U.S. has been paying "probably 90% of the cost of NATO." The U.S. has been paying 22% of actual NATO costs, spending 72% of the total defence spending of the alliance. Guess it kinda like his inauguration crowd !!!

@swbrailriders @_tylerwade Not former he‚Äôll b back next week after the all star break
@JonHeyman @Fancred Hope someone else gets him y@ankees keep prospects and get him next year in FA
@BryanHoch I imagine it‚Äôs everyone else that‚Äôs the problem
Damn I messed up SAUER goes in 8 push everyone back one
Yankees top 10 prospect asterisk for top üíØ - all subjective my list   1 Sheffield * 2 Florial * 3 Loisigna * 4 Abreau * 5 Acevedo  6  Medina  7 Whitlock  8 Tate  9 Garcia  10 Carrol    Maybe slide Schmidt n if u like starter over reliever that is Carrol  Adams out * was top 100
Ohh by the way minus last nights Bill Buckner move that cost them the Game Greg Bird looks pretty damn good recently !!!!
Dude @ the beach out me on his ig live told me talk to the people I look at viewers and it was 3 !!! Common broski
@JonathanMayo 16 total games between  low &amp; high A -1.13 &amp; 1.90 era respectively 97ks 20w in 87 innings &amp; a whip below 1 kids looking pretty good damn 22 yr old Garret Whitlock !!!!
Last couple days and few games the yankees have killed themselves - splitting with bmore is sooo Unacceptable and even worse losing 3 of 4 they should be calling for heads - they‚Äôve been playing to level of company all year now 3.5 our 2 n loss is no good place
@pinstripealley No stay with the infield we have. Ow evaluate at the seas know end of u wanna get Manny it‚Äôll cost money no players -get a damn pitcher now that‚Äôs what they need not a 3b or SS
Have you Ever noticed someone going hard on ig live or snap then realize they are literally talking to 2 people ?? I mean pick up the phone that‚Äôs a three way call bro
@MissEMILYs @loveandhiphopat Naw love I‚Äôm good
@coachCCB @hitmansteviej Facts
@sistersinpower1 Falcons of course
@towazy @YankeesWFAN @Yankees My take is unsound absolutely ridiculous and maybe should refrain from making a fool of yaself 2 Game lead with over 75 to play ur silly
@UberFacts Now it‚Äôs free to bita a kid riding his bike &amp; die
@Robfeliz He‚Äôs actually a terrible manager but very likable and good with media and most importantly hard to complain when u have third best record n game - but yes his decisions suck starting with what u pointed out
@Robfeliz Well when u lose to bmore does it really mattter seems like yankees get lax vs bad team shoulda swept Toronto and should b sweeping bmore instead we hop for 3 outta 4
@Fyocca123 Exactly
Meathead telling it like it is https://t.co/aH0jyEftFQ
2 people that r winning 1 drake 2 Aubrey
Folks blaming Democrats, it‚Äôs wise to remember that they are not the ones who held up Merrick Garland. If you want Democrats to exert power, they need to have it first. So ultimately, this is on the voters for being complacent. Self reflect !!
U better pay attention a Game is a Game and boston is winning of course u feel it now they are 2.5 Games back and could picked up a half game clearly u don‚Äôt know baseball
That really hurt the Yankees not a good look losing to bmore today now game 2 a must win with Cessa going
@BryanHoch This loss will hurt more then most - they need a big 9th inning
This loss will really hurt the Yankees definitely a game they should‚Äôve won - bad coaching by Boone yet again but it shouldn‚Äôt b close either SMH
Another day another bad coaching decision from Boone he‚Äôs made many  - yankees will prob / hopefully win and it‚Äôll b forgotten but in the playoffs al these moves will b under microscope and I don‚Äôt count WC as playoffs
@careym74 Wrong nobody cares bout scouts when ur 2 down n division race as evidenced By the score all games count right now
Split would b disgusting today need both pick up a half n standing and 1 n loss column
Why would I think yh3 yankees could money into b,ore and grab 2 real quick - un fucking real
@BryanHoch &amp; wtf does that mean - I used to feel great bout trigonometry doesn‚Äôt meAn I did well
@BryanHoch Dunno what the hell that means - this is a NY team please use our jargon or coach the As - dodgers or angels
@careym74 Teams Don‚Äôt cost themselves games trying to showcase talent !!!
Let‚Äôs play 2 !!! Yankees vs Orioles
Early yankee game thank for for MLB network !!
So he yankees decided to roll out the whole Scranton lineup in game 1 today ?? Wtf is this Drury - Wade - Walker -Higgy &amp; Frazier
@wheelan_matthew @jcrasnick At least SS is hella deep

@YankeesPR @swbrailriders Well that‚Äôs a promotion from double A he can get some more inning , learn how to finish batters off , fine tune some things , get on innings limit and come back strong if needed !!

@MixMamba34 @Lakers @kawhileonard Ball I think is definitely a gonner
@MixMamba34 @Lakers @kawhileonard Hell no they r destroying the Lebron signing having Ball - Rondo - Stephenson &amp; lebron all on same team makes no sense they all need the ball üèÄ
Johnny ‚öæÔ∏è has to figure out how to close the deal - the 2 strike contact is ridiculous kids never gonna go more then 5 innings like seriously next step is going further and putting hitters away quicker !!!
Next up for the Lakers signing Mello after OKC buys him out !!!
@billboard Damn prob got a new wrangler to boot
@PeezystayNorfin U sound nuts nobody y‚Äôall brought n plays good D and  Randall was a young cornerstone to build on if healthy - construction of this team seems very weird a bunch of people that need the üèÄ n hand

@PeezystayNorfin Lance - Rondo or ball play good D and u just Randall leave for New Orleans whats ya point with that tweet
Johnny Lasaigna aka Johnny ‚öæÔ∏è on the mound tonight !!!!!
confused what the Lakers r doing they have 3 people that have to have the üèÄ n hand - Rondo can‚Äôt shoot can‚Äôt play off the ball - Lance can‚Äôt create from wing he creates from straight on &amp; lebron is point fwd that doesn‚Äôt include Lonzo another can‚Äôt shoot ball n hand creator
On another note is watching Cole Hamels throw clunkers &amp; Fuller not really being good as first thought , he‚Äôs def not 2 n the Yankee rotation ...  Is Happ now the best option ? @JonHeyman
How many of them vs how many of us , nobody really knows cuz some them are hiding in the weeds but guess we‚Äôll see next Election Day !!!
with every passing day Trump galvanizes his base with the things he‚Äôs doing ..  The Supreme Court nominee being a kkk advocate just speaks to his disrespect for the country as well as his desire 2 rile up his base .. sad thing is it‚Äôs working like a charm !!!!

@IAM_GITO Facts
If Jorge Mateo didn‚Äôt suck , Fowler had absolutely no where to play on this team @ KAP  Seems like he may never freaking start a game I‚Äôd be livid about the sonny Gray trade
Sonny Gray is the pitcher the other teams get Happy when they‚Äôre facing all wondering how high can I get my avaerage during this game
I said it on Tuesday and I stand by it why would u alter rotation and keep Gray pitching on Saturday night nationally televised game against the Red Sox should flipped CC let the kids pitch Saturday &amp; Sunday
I got one for u @JackCurryYES when Tanaka is healthy let‚Äôs keep Loisigna &amp; German in rotation &amp; let Gray figure it out !!!
Sonny Gray will fuck up a Saturday evening quick , fast and in a hurry - guess I‚Äôll go to the movies and wait for Severino tomorrow !!!!!
@CeoFrizz Smh guess that was a pipe dream
Woooow grand slam n the first inning against Sonny Gray &amp; I‚Äôm sure Chris Sale is like yup this ones over already !!! Sonny Gray sucks seriously sucks

@jimcallisMLB so I‚Äôm wondering why Johnny Loisigna isn‚Äôt in the top 100 ?? By the time y‚Äôall put him in he would‚Äôve graduated !! #Johnnybaseball
Welcome back @JackCurryYES  hope u enjoyed the wifes weekend now down to the nitty gritty of the post game !!!!
@OfficialDouvo Let‚Äôs do it
Speaking of Atlanta u can catch me on the fan very soon talking atlanta sports ‚öæÔ∏è,üèÄ, üèà should be fun tune in https://t.co/ychTuh3WSZ
I‚Äôm here and never leaving welcome me to the A full time !!!!!
@AkaLanceVance No bitch but the check is
Meek has come full circle comeback complete !!!!!
@TBT_Ent Horrible analogy and the league he played in was the top euro league def no slouches and he won mvp but yes time will tell
@KanoPowPow I hope so but like the ‚Äú scout ‚Äú said beware you‚Äôre not getting Eddie house instead of Steph curry
@DaveLeeC3 And Doncik is that just taller, better and can shoot it
@TBT_Ent He‚Äôs a 6‚Äô8 19 yr old Point guard with vision , instincts &amp; can shoot it and at 6‚Äô8 with another inch or 2 u don‚Äôt need to b supremely athletic - he‚Äôs a game changer
@Fresko024 2-3 days a week
@ant_mosley Damn hotel police
@DWHomeCandles Live these
Atlanta hawks gave up Donsic for Young that‚Äôs gonna be a bad move moving forward - actually a horrible move
@lazofficial Lol ohhh my bad , I misread the post üòÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Laz whaaaat Up !!!!
@WOWFactsOfLife @lazofficial Wtf kinda exes u had usually takes me 1 , 2 tops trips to the club and I‚Äôm good
@Austinromine7 - Austin Romine keep the same energy now your a starter so don‚Äôt complain &amp; produce let‚Äôs c u get exposed u fucking bum never have u had starter skills you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre a back up - produce now here is ya chance
@BrendanKutyNJ Let‚Äôs start with at what time is Shreve gonna be DFAed hopefully before the flight back north
Lol fucking  yankees get swept by the rays inexcusable like seriously inexcusable!!!
I imagine that‚Äôs the last we will see of Chasen Shreve I hate they lost but if that‚Äôs what it took for them to DFA him &amp; call up Carroll I‚Äôm cool with it !!! ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úåüèæ‚úåüèæüñïüèæ
Miguel Andujar has a lot of Adrian Beltre mannerisms in him - I wonder if You asked who his favorite player was what he would say??
@TheGreatWhite Yeah really it is and the rules are more of a joke - wonder if Frazier leaves the yard on that one ??
Now with Romine talking that shit bout being a back up catcher let‚Äôs c what he does or doesn‚Äôt do with his shot - I expect Sanchize to be out for a while at least a week if in fact that was his groin ...
Prediction German has 2 more starts before Tanaka comes back if he looks like this &amp; Loisigna looks half way decent he‚Äôs outta there Johnny will continue to gets starts
@TheGreatWhite Please already man wtf was he looking at the last 2 pitches were supposed to be smoked somewhere
If u think in a 162 game season your team isn‚Äôt gonna lose some they were supposed to win then you‚Äôre insane !!! As annoying as it may be it happens 2 everyone , it‚Äôs not news !
@swbrailriders Well he has no options so being sent down won‚Äôt b that easy but we can def cut him
I knoooooow Austin Romine isn‚Äôt hinting he‚Äôs unhappy with being the back up catcher - no way no how , he almost been out the league and now he‚Äôs beefing bout being the back up to Sanchize - I blame trump for this @AndrewMarchand
Pure love is giving w/o the thought of getting anything in return !!
I‚Äôm fixing MLB playoff system right now top 5 in order of wins &amp; losses division winners are cool but playoffs via wins and losses
@Gray1Lala Scrappy back n the A but Richie D might be on ya tv screen
Just an FYI if the Yankees play roughly 500 ball the rest of the way they‚Äôd still win 95 games &amp; did I mention the second half they have the third weakest schedule in MLB !!?? Just saying
Finally got this sucker to come visit me - now he doesn‚Äôt wanna leave https://t.co/hfyXyapvkk
@CEO_RaNGE On point I agree
@CEO_RaNGE Facts
Why girls get ‚Äú hair did‚Äù here n Miami is beyond me - humidity is the crazy money waster !!
I‚Äôm all for patience &amp; if the Yankees continue to win I imagine I understand the rational with Greg Bird but common man something has to be done he literally sucks right now - starting to think imhea just not the answer
@iamKingLos what up my G I‚Äôm waiting on the heat !!
Green  - Betances - Chapman &amp; Holder I can do w/o Warren , Shreve the new Robertson &amp; Cessa   Yankee bullpen this year
Yankees hit Amir of homers but they aren‚Äôt incapable of building runs Gardner - Judge high ob guy , Stanton supposed to be high ob guy - Sanchize pure hitter tho very slow - Hicks high ob guy with lots of speed , Torres, Andujar , Didi all contact guys with vg athleticism
@Joelsherman1 Lost ya damn mind don‚Äôt be  disrespectful !!!!
Lemme find out tuberculosis meds ‚Äú Bgc ‚Äú cures type 1 diabetes !!!
@daze11 Damn really I thought 6‚Äô6 damn now I really love the pic
Doncik 6‚Äô6 pg with handles , Iq &amp; can score maybe not as loud or hyperbolic but def a cornerstone building block - I‚Äôm going with the European everyday twice on Sunday
So not only are the kids being separated from parents but they‚Äôre also being taken out of the states parents are in -how do u plan to reunite or do u ???
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @CLewandowski_ Damn I wanna hear the rest of this the end was the best , where‚Äôs the rest of the sound bite
Ok I‚Äôm done I‚Äôll do my draft analysis in my head alone - catch me on the fan Atlanta very soon talking  üèà ,‚öæÔ∏è üèÄ
I woulda took porter way too much upside to pass up plus he‚Äôs gonna have a chip on shoulder if he was able to come out last year he woulda been top 5
Wooooooow Kevin Knox these guys never cease to amaze lol but u know what I‚Äôm not mad 6‚Äô9 can shoot it , handle it and will b the new 3 man like fizdale Said position less basketball he‚Äôs a 3-4
now Knick have a decision .. do u swing for fences with porter or go solid with  bridges
Cavs fooled everyone well at least me thought the6 were picking Porter- he a superb athlete Daron Fox / John wall type n transition he gonna run it down ya throat amazing athlete when he extends j to 3 gonna be a beast -
Bamba from Texas goes 2 Orlando front court is good &amp; young he‚Äôs a gonna solidify the paint athletic and long as hell D is gone be crazy run ,jump , block and rebound the ball wont need shots at all will get his off the glass
So what now Schroeder is a goner or what both small can‚Äôt play togethers would be a defensible liability !!!
DALLAS drafts Trey Young I think everyone knows what he can do with the ball score from anywhere , pass his butt off  kinda small &amp; not crazy athletic so d will be the question but he can handle the pill , dish &amp; score with the best
J Jackson Mich state gonna be high energy can shoot the ball very athletic lotta rebounds &amp; great D with average scoring
Doncik goes to DALLAS via Atl with the 3rd pick - played n Europe won the chip - offensively gonna be good 6‚Äô6 plays the 1 only 19 yrs old can shoot, handle &amp; pass high IQ - gonna be r rally good let‚Äôs how he plays d tho no overly athletic but man a 6‚Äô6 point that can score
Bagley good offensive choice no d yet but him with Fox will be a nice 1-2
Phoenix takes Ayton I like it big ,strong ,good footwork and can shoot it a lil bit from 15-20 A+ pick - he can‚Äôt be lazy n the league and that‚Äôs a good thing for him !!!
First day of summer , Enjoy it people !!!
Don‚Äôt look now the Yankees have a 2 game lead and 4 in the loss !!!!
Stantooooon !!!!!!
At least commentators r finally calling out Boone for his bad bullpen management - ridiculous to bring shreve n that situation just plain stupid now instead of 3-3 it‚Äôs 5-3
Hope Drury is playing first cuz Bird isn‚Äôt it !!!
So they brought fanny pacs back specifically to cover the box while wearing leggings / joggers / spandex now a ninja just gotta b disrespectful and stare
@TommieLHHATL Don‚Äôt set ya followers up the Nigga just might b like ‚úåüèæ
So I guess the Yankees r conceding this game by leaving Shreve in
How the hell Is  Shreve sitting on a 4.5 era &amp; get the call in that situation bad call by Boone shoulda let the kid get out the inning - i repeat a 4.5 doesn‚Äôt warrant much confidence actually Boone make a lot of bad calls
Looking at the boxscore they have the Mariner run charged to Johnny ‚öæÔ∏è , hows that possible when he scored on a throwing error E4 @AndrewMarchand
@AndrewMarchand Naw he was gone regardless nobody liked him , like seriously he was one Game from the pennant if that didn‚Äôt save his gig it wasn‚Äôt saveable
@JoyAnnReid Criticism from some but I‚Äôm sure people are home like ‚Äú yes we are taking America back ‚Äú just a matter of how many of each
@TommieLHHATL ü§ö
I‚Äôve said since last year that Monty stuff is nowhere near as good as Germans &amp; now he‚Äôs showing it yet the Yankees are still acting like they don‚Äôt know what role he plays - he isn‚Äôt Chad Green he has 3 pitches.. he‚Äôs a starter !!  @JackCurryYES please help me understand
This world is so fucked up right now !!!!
@rileyreidx3 False advertising we all know you‚Äôre not doing that but it sounds good I guess
@Moosh0611 @JackCurryYES No
@BestRealityBlog Interesting
Yankee all stars only Judge is winning fan vote but overall should be Judge  - Sanchez - Severino - Chapman &amp; Betances &amp; maybe Torres !!
@BestRealityBlog üëÄ who told U that ??
JZ &amp; Beyonc√© album did these numbers below and these number aren‚Äôt including Tidal which had the project for a day and a half before other streaming sites I-guesstimate another 25-50k worth of streaming &amp; pure     115,000-125,000 [Sales Plus Streams] 72,000-77,000 [Pure Sales
@Joelsherman1 Gotta make the right moves and not send off the right players I prefer to hoard them all
@BryanHoch @MLBNetwork Where is Eziquiel Duran and why isn‚Äôt he n Charleston
Is Dellin Betances an all-star ?? @JackCurryYES
The energy you put into this world will always come back to you when you least expect it.
‚ÄúOver here we measure success by the success of those with us - u broke if everybody around u broke but u ‚Äú !!! JZ
Motherfuckas post moments talking about this is a private moment between our family , we are very private it‚Äôs nobodies biz what we do but yet the shits on the gram - this shit has always confused me
@QueezyDaChamp Yes sir u 2 Cuzo
@chrishaunaxx How u try either u do or U don‚Äôt !!
Happy Father‚Äôs Day 2 all the dads !!!!
@MeMpHiTz Dude I thought we was fin to get it poppin out here
I just wanna know whose taking the pics &amp; who are you eating with while n Dubai  or any of these other foreign cities u pretend to have hostings in ????
Phone ain‚Äôt rang in so long I had to call myself ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@TommieLHHATL ohhhhhh tommmiiiieeeeee
Has Beyonc√© made y‚Äôall forget  Nas dropped a project produced by Kanye ??
@slutsaucekhloe I dunno wait a few years it‚Äôll b obvious
@mamajeweldollaz None of them not them but specifically these https://t.co/q642pbd8oT
Work hard play harder https://t.co/Iry9a6v5Fm
If I ever c another pair of them ugly ass balenciaga shoes it‚Äôll be a day 2 soon !!!
@JudgeGregMathis Judge what‚Äôs up my brotha !!
@JackCurryYES  looks like if Betances keeps up this pace he could be going to another all star game that would give the Yankees 3 pitchers &amp; 3 position players !!!
Yankees literally have a varsity &amp; JV of major league ready players - Frazier -Drury - Wade -McKinney -  Austin - all would be productive major league players on other teams !!!
@JonathanMayo Lol happened to get n late and was watching yankee rewind
Where r living in a day when the truth doesn‚Äôt matter &amp; the narrative is most important .. in other words it doesn‚Äôt  matter what really happened or was said as long as I said it first and say it louder !!!
@JackCurryYES @shocbomb23 Just goes to show how good he really is as a hitting catcher , expect those on pace numbers to rise cuz he won‚Äôt hit this bad all season
I‚Äôm guessing we gonna c Johnny Loisigna in the top üíØ prospects very soon !!!! @JonathanMayo
Don‚Äôt let all this internet fuckery distract u from the fact yankees demoted  Tyler Austin &amp; Nas releases new music @ 12am
Does Gleyber Torres really have 30 plus Home run power with a high average &amp; minus the occasional brain freeze stellar defense !!! @JackCurryYES sound like a perennial all star to me !!!
Guessing Gary Sanchize should be Happy he‚Äôs not a Minnesora Twin , they definitely just sent Miguel Sano down to single A with comparable numbers ?? Ya thoughts
New beginnings stay tuned !! https://t.co/MNUMp9FHGg
@TheLatifah Def not in this case hollywood cast trip is hardly L&amp;HH  england nobody told that lie
@YankeesPR What‚Äôs good with 8 what‚Äôs he waiting on
Chance Adams goes for Scranton let‚Äôs see how this works out tonight   Domingo Acevedo for Trenton should be able to go 5 today   Albert Abreau went 5 innings on runs 6k today looked very good   Junk goes for Charleston
No L&amp;HH England my friends so all u people across the pond can stop dming me !!! wrongly disseminated information by a blogger who didn‚Äôt do proper due diligence .. which brings me to my question what‚Äôs more important being first or being right ??
Problem with todays blogger is everyone wants to be first!!! They often miss the part that they disseminate wrong info... I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs the problem with a saturated market of people with little experience or credentials trying to make a name !
Sometimes u just have to be mad at yaself for giving them the power !!!
Yankees have been winning  with a bad Hicks , Sanchize &amp; Bird a mediocre Stanton &amp; Gardner an inconsistent Didi and a Judge that isn‚Äôt yet locked in &amp; they‚Äôre still #1 n runs -ops etc etc pretty scary huh
Greg Bird is the one that needs a break not Andujar - he‚Äôs flat out sucked but so has Austin bring Drury up or give walker some at bats
@JackCurryYES  Toe already up and I kinda think Drury comes up soon replacing Austin 1B &amp; DH at bats
Yankee updated after draft top 10 prospects   1 Florial   2 Sheffield  3 Abreau    4 Medina   5 Loisigna   6 D Garcia   7 Acevedo   8 Adams   9 Perez   10 Sauer   Wade - Drury - Frazier - McKinney all pro level players n Scranton   @JonathanMayo Sure u agree lol
Watching these HS kids sign professional deals it appears every player in America signed with Vandy @JonathanMayo
If you‚Äôre a yankee fan Loisigna isn‚Äôt coming outta nowhere ..  he‚Äôs prob a top 5 prospect @ this point !!! Very Good stuff great control was often injured early on , yankees lucked up with this one !!! Can‚Äôt guarantee a no hitter but he‚Äôs as ready stuff wise as anyone else !!
1 big difference MJ &amp; Bron people didn‚Äôt wanna c mike they were intimidated by him &amp; his demeanor , people look 2 attack Bron and bring him down as evidenced by no let down being up 3-0 they wanted to sweep him embarrass him !!! That‚Äôs not taking away from his skill ijs ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ok Johnny Lasagna gets blasted n double A today maybe I should pump the breaks a lil @JonathanMayo
@Shayd__1 U earned it
Happy Sunday afternoon , be productive !!!
Yankees farm is throwing   Hale 3A Loisigna 2A Green Hi A  Lenehen Lo A  Excited to Johnny ‚öæÔ∏è think he‚Äôs getting the call next Friday replacing Tanaka
@Jackiebel12 Coming soon the wfan in atlanta
I stand by Domingo German being better then Jordan Montgomery
I remember last year people were discussing who they would rather have Conforto or judge lmao difference a year makes !!!!
@BryanHoch 2 words Johnny Loisigna
Damn Tanaka our for weeks ?? Helloooooooo Johnny Loisigna
@InTheDarkIShine @itskinkcity Some things better left unsaid if I played hurt and hid the injury then keep on hiding it - subs don‚Äôt work here
@JonathanMayo did anyone n the Yankee draft jump out at u , maybe a  HS kid or college underclassmen with signability issues that may be coerced into signing  w/ super hi upside ??
@BNightengale Sucks but that‚Äôs always been the issue if he‚Äôs hurt u lose a bat &amp; pitcher every 5th day !!! The trade off becomes 32 starts or 600 ABs Doing 1 or 300- 350 abs &amp; 15-20 starts doing both
If anyone has folkowed Miguel Andujar they know he doesn‚Äôt really lock in until the second half - which could be pretty scary for MLB !!!!!! @JonathanMayo
Yankees relievers lead the Majors with 276K and rank second with a  .208 opponents' BA‚Ä¶rank third in the AL and sixth in the Majors with a  3.17 ERA. And they haven‚Äôt played well yet !!!!
Yankees lead MLB in runs per game (5.59), HR (98), HR per game (1.66), OPS (.803) and BB (236)‚Ä¶rank second in runs (330) Red Sox lead by 5 n 5 more games ,SLG (.467), OBP (.336), XBHs (227) and total bases (952). Are on pace to hit 269 HR; the MLB single-season HR record is 264
It‚Äôs a good day when ya #9 hitter is hitting 294 with 10 homers &amp; 28 RBIs 1/3 of the way thru that translates to about 30 homers - 84 RBIs at the bottoms of the order !!!!
If Sheffield improves control u can add him to rotation with Acevedo - Abreau - as soon as next season
Still have McKinney - Drury - Frazier - Higgi - Estrada - Torreyes - Wade sitting n 3A with no place to play - all essentially mlb caliber players
Yankee core - Sanchize - Bird - Torres - Didi - Andujar - Frazier - Judge - Hicks - Stanton - thats a whole team 28 &amp; under at this point the farm doesn‚Äôt need to be good they have no place for anyone else and yet it‚Äôs still gonna be top 10 next season
So lil Wayne‚Äôs victory wasn‚Äôt the ten million bucks universal gave him but the freedom to be signed with republic records &amp; not cash money was the real victory - no subsidiary he goes theu the major now
Yankees are a half game behind he Red Sox , 23 games over vs 22 games yet the Yankees have a better winning pct 690 - 683 whose actually n first ?? @JackCurryYES
So do the cavs get swept ???
I get the power stroke gets u a homer but bases loaded shift on why not bunt and getthe easy  single &amp; rbi ?? Keep line moving !!! Now u roll over a pitch and he‚Äôs out the inning
Questions of the day !!! Do the Cavs hold home court with a victory tonight ?? Do love - JR &amp; Thomphson show up - does Hood get off the bench ??
Good morning tweeps , make it a good one !!!
@BryanHoch And by end of season he‚Äôll b hitting 260 with 35 homers 100 runs &amp; rbis - it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs not the catcher no need to look at numbers
@JonathanMayo how do U feel about the Yankees first 2 pics ? I‚Äôm kinda feeling like 1 was gimmick  &amp; 2 was crap shoot , as all draft picks are but they definitely had others they coulda used the pic on !!!!! Feel they take intl draft more seriously !!
And y‚Äôall wonder why I over due it when the sun comes out !!!! https://t.co/O7QrSms8Z6
@JonathanMayo Why would the Yankees pick this kid so high he‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt even listed as a first round player ??
@TanGypsyChick What Hotel were u at Fountain blue
So united airlines has mlb network I hear !!!!!!! My new airline I think ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@TanGypsyChick Shoulda spoke
One thing I miss about not being n NY anymore is I can‚Äôt watch @YESNetwork yankee pregame and postgame coverage not 2 mention the actual games !!!!
@JosinaAnderson @rihanna Sounds bout right doesn‚Äôt it ??
On second thought bad day for yankee farm pitchers - Sheffield rocked - Abreau looks nasty
Aaron Judge through June 1st  ‚öæ .290 ‚öæ 16 HR ‚öæ 41 RBI ‚öæ .419 OBP ‚öæ 42 R  In 53 games not even a third thru yet !!!!! At this pace c below !!!!   290 50 + homers 125 + runs 419 obp  130 + runs   I‚Äôd take it
Gleyber is indeed good ?? https://t.co/88FjX7cqkj
U like pitching on the Yankee farm well today is a good day - Sheffield in 3A - Acevedo piggy backing n 2A - Abreau n HiA - &amp; Garcia n low A should be fun
@RyleekB Get some followers trolling ass pussy ya mother &amp; ya bitch love me tho - I take my cock out Dey mouth
All the outrage about  ‚Äú slavery was a choice ‚Äú yet this dude got bla k folks 2 fly into Wyoming !!!! Congrats Kanye point made
@BaseballAmerica Louis Medina &amp; Johnny Loisigna
Kanye had all them black folk n Wyoming listening to his album &amp; chillin only thing missin was Trump and make America great again merch
@JosinaAnderson Clear who ur rooting for !!
Wooow Lebron is something else !!!! man ole man something else !!!!!
Prediction Torreyes is coming back up Austin headed to Scranton
@BryanHoch @MLBNetwork Most  important bat n lineup apparently
@BryanHoch Aaron Hicks plays Gold Glove caliber D , best defensive alignment is with Gardy n left &amp; Hicks n CF that‚Äôs not 2 say Frazier hasn‚Äôt earned a shot with his Bat but for now the offense is moving the D is suspect don‚Äôt need another suspect defender
@BryanHoch @robneyer He plays good D sometimes u have to go with stellar D instead of projected O hell lookbat Jackie Bradley JR
Hmmm Pusha T !!!!! Oughta get interesting
@Fyocca123 Hamels I‚Äôm not enamored with old and as season wears on so will he need a young stud and they don‚Äôt exist on the market
My prediction the Yankees need to win the division because a one and done scares me !!!! To much swing and miss and the ability to be shut down by good pitching is nervous !!!!
@Fyocca123 What‚Äôs the move for a pitcher cuz torres isn‚Äôt going anywhere reigning AL Player of the week Andujar getting comfy at third and CC will remain n rotation
@71djt @iamwandasykes @RoseanneOnABC Nonreally considering the whole damn show is gone
The problem is not that the yankees lose its how they lose !!! careless mistakes , bad pitching , bad fielding !!!! &amp; The real issue is apparently Boston doesn‚Äôt lose !!!!
@bsmeazy üíØ agreed
Yankee pitching sucks man !!!! when u play the Astros or a team with good pitching it really shows , u just feel like yankees aren‚Äôt gonna score but will need 6 too win
Dope episode
It‚Äôs better to walk in the dark with a friend then walk alone in the light !!
Morgan‚Äôs last episode on ‚Äú criminal minds ‚Äú gets me every time https://t.co/UBmmcRv6w2
@AndrewMarchand Bye bye racist
ABC cxls ‚Äú Roseanne ‚Äú reboot üëã bitch !!!
I can‚Äôt stand racist ass Rosanne just because her and trump had it out doesn‚Äôt means she‚Äôs invited to the bbq - perfect example ya enemies enemy isn‚Äôt always ya friend
First i feel bad for CP3 don‚Äôt think harden valued him until the 3rd quarter ended tonight - now with that said I got GS in 5
@CNN Clearly he thought the hype train started &amp; stopped with him but now the other 2 r hugging it out and staying on board Donnie feels silly yet again
@Chris_Broussard And both looked like they were facing Severino
Trump is such an idiot - his Memorial Day message offended the troops just as much as he offends everyone else - self promotion when he should‚Äôve  been paying respects - does it ever end with this guy
@Amirkhary Facts
Harden gotta come thru big tonight !!!! Like lebron big
@BabyFaceMckie @KingDavidsPen Very easy to watch after that comment kinda wish someone ran and kicked her n the face
Hey Brave  fans ya Acuna Prayers were answered - mild ACL sprain nothing serious is good being young snap back game strong üí™üèæ
Feel bad for German tough inning struck out Gattis and blind ump issues walk Didi boots grounder shoulda been out the inning or at most been a Solo shot
That quick it‚Äôs 3-0 Astros no bueno man damn
@JonathanMayo Johnny Loisigna , Louis Medina or Trevor Stephan
@CEO_RaNGE No bro they wouldn‚Äôt a wide open 6‚Äô6 man ahead of the field is a no brainer pass knock it off
Cleveland loses to whoever comes out the west n 5-6
Rozier just erased all the good he did no doubt Celtics waiting on kyrie - Jalen brown stunk it up - horford is hella soft - smart can‚Äôt shoot a lick
@JonathanMayo how many kids do I have to c graduate before another Yankee cracks the top üíØ
@CeoFrizz Where did u hear that ?? Wouldn‚Äôt be a bad move with the bullpen issues , then guys have to get right
@chibbs_1 - Still remember u shook that Russian under the scorers table @ gaucho gym many years ago &amp; did the same thing to Bobby Hurley at columbia university gym Golden hoops - classic moments
The rockets have lost games 7-8-9 &amp; 10 golden state in a flow &amp; rhythm now it‚Äôs over
Maybe A.J. Cole should stay and one of the other bullpen bums  should go take ya pic holder - Shreve - German - kahnle - Robertson - betances
@BryanHoch Question is who they don‚Äôt have any good ones
Why would they expect kahnle to get out when he couldn‚Äôt get out in Scranton on Thursday he got lit up
@CeoFrizz Def isnt a trade away unless u giving up the whole farm which why would they for another bat when they clearly need pitching
@CeoFrizz I woulda loved to have him but u mus5 not b an Andujar fam cuz that‚Äôs who they wanted
I wanna check on a Greg ü¶Ö ID he look 60
Shoulda fucking sent gray down and kept Torreyes
@JonathanMayo Definitely swings the bat always said he reminds me of Beltre minus the plate discipline and stellar D
This kid doesn‚Äôt have a chance throwing 92 mph 2 this yankee lineup
@JonathanMayo we‚Äôve been preaching the Andujar sermon for quite sometime so I know u can appreciate this comment coming from me - he has absolutely no range at third
Doesn‚Äôt matter who catches Gray he sucks point blank period I haven‚Äôt lost my focus cuz he pitched‚òùÔ∏ègood game
Tanaka has sucked but honestly nobody else from the free agent market is any better - Darvish now hurt
A pitcher shoulda been sent down in my humble opinion
I did 2 Torreyes made little sense when randomly used pitchers remain n bullpen
@keithlaw Backlash will b unprecedented
@keithlaw  is Luke Heimlich gonna get drafted ??
@jimcallisMLB is Luke Heimlich gonna get drafted ??
@JonathanMayo is Luke Heimlich gonna get drafted ??
So @Bergdorfs drops packages off without requiring signature now my fucking shoes r floating around the universe on someone elese feet - most ridiculous shit I‚Äôve heard yet
Big Toe unfair casualty of roster crunch- wonder how that convo went ??!!
The love affair with this 8 man bullpen is ridiculous literally A.J. Cole pitches once every 2 weeks
@xvgabexv @JackCurryYES Well considering they get the 26th man for the double dip that makes no sense
@f1ghtsamurai @rambledove @colbycolb And he walked in and out the prelim hearings and is still free on appeal which is why u should  think before tweeting thank u my point has been made
Wow big Toe gets sent down which makes me wonder if Lind wanted out or is Ford just that guy now !!! Damn so Big Toe not Austin , I guess ??!!
@TMZ If ratings were good the decision woulda been tougher
@JackCurryYES so whose driving Tyler 2 Scranton
@CeoFrizz Very special got some all star games in him starting with this year -will win ROY after othani inevitably slows down he‚Äôll bat 260 with era over 4 when it‚Äôs Said &amp; done
@PeterKerasotis @JackCurryYES Nooooo keep Gardy there they‚Äôre winning no pressure n 9 hole pitchers have no reprieve Gleyber hits 25 homers 900ops and becomes an allstar plenty of time to hit lead off he‚Äôs 21
@rambledove @colbycolb Sounds bout right Rich privilege
@CeoFrizz Actually only when I c selling warming for his second inning - he shuts them down. When going 1
@BryanHoch Don‚Äôt forget yaself my Man U were right before Sanchize
@JackCurryYES He‚Äôs been saving it for the big dance
Never thought I‚Äôd say this but watching Dave Robertson warm up gives me Tyler Clippard flashbacks
Judge is absolutely a 5 tooo stud runs - hits - power/patience - defends - and a cannon that defensive WAR on the rise
@alexriveraa24 @BryanHoch He won‚Äôt even be n the majors after tomorrow that‚Äôll def hurt his chances
@BryanHoch I voted for GT also but we all know Otani is gonna get ROY adding the pitching stats make this easy it‚Äôs clear ya followers are Yankee fans
@JonathanMayo time for the Yankees to start stockpiling intl bonus money for the Vega Vega kid from Cuba
Warriors catch a huge break , with NO CP3 for game 6 they‚Äôre almost assured it goes back to houston for a one &amp; done ! Pressure will be on Rockets @ Home &amp; looking for first finals Berth
@SiirBrock Snap been dead since Jenner shot them then later Riri buried them
@TMZ U gonna go back to DALLAS and u Miami and u Nyc what an ignorant fuck he is
Oh and none of today‚Äôs action has me forgetting that the Republicans wanna be  repub governor of Ga is riding around on a bus looking to lock up illegals and the NFL just dreaded free speech and expression with the whole kneeling thing
Damn ‚Äú Star ‚Äú was good as hell 2 shit actually mad tonight was last ep
Can‚Äôt front Empire finally was crazy !!!
Yankees bullpen should be ashamed of itself can‚Äôt keep a 4 run lead against the rangers
@CeoFrizz Yes indeed and while everyone talking bout betances don‚Äôt b distracted by the fact Robertson is worse
How tall is Gelo Ball if he‚Äôs 6‚Äô8 he‚Äôs got a shot on some 3&amp; D type shit !!!!
Gardy LF Judge RF Bird 1B Stanton DH Sanchize C  Gregorius SS Hicks CF Andujar 3B  Torres 2B  Dream on that Yankee Fans
Be careful when u look for attention cuz  these days u never know what attention ya attention will get u !!!
Wednesday the middle of ya  work week go hard finish üí™üèæ Memorial weekend is upon us !!!!
@TheGreatWhite Next year if they don‚Äôt he‚Äôll b n the mix but Stanton will start in left if Gardy goes
@baseball_ref They don‚Äôt
@TheGreatWhite Yeah I see DH n his future with Gardy out next year messes things up for the Fraziers &amp; Austin‚Äôs of the world tho that‚Äôs at bats taken from them
@BryanHoch How many of them passed balls / wild pitches were on Sanchize
@TheGreatWhite Were the wild pitches his fault ??
@TrentonThunder @JonathanMayo please tell me Johnny Loisigna isn‚Äôt hurt leaving the game after 3 -1 run innings &amp; 63 pitches
Having alotta time to watch the Braves games and these young kids r the truth Albies - Acuna - Swanson &amp; Freeman remind me of last years yankees ahead of schedule just like them !!!!!
2017     2018  AVG      261   263  HR          11      11  RBI         30     28  SLG      .527   520  Won NL MVP in 2017 w/.281 AVG, 59 HR, 132 RBI  Gincarlo Stanton stats Pretty scary right ??
People forget Aaron Judge was very high &amp; very low last year if he can stay consistently in the are he is now I think it‚Äôs possible he replicates or exceeds last years numbers
@Fyocca123 Yes for sure horrid start ran outta characters Tanaka has sucked - gray inconsistent cc good Severino great German I for 2 but Montgomery was pretty good
Sanchez good power number bad avg - obp Austin good power &amp; avg bad splits  Torres beastin Didi horrible slump  Andujar no eye swings @ everything no walks at all 2 many ks Gardner recently decent  Judge - been n slump obp and power still ridiculous  Hicks nothing special good d
We gonna find out Bartolo Colon is Gleyber Torres uncle or some shit - he serving them up on a T for the kid !!!!
@reneegraziano Yes indeed Grazi we def do and def will
@CosbySugar @AndrewMarchand No worries yankees on mlb network tonight &amp; wed on ESPN so u good it‚Äôs cloudy out anyway watch the games
Hold up lemme understand this  - Didi mired in ridiculous slump couple days off ok I get it but Tues - Wed rained out Thursday travel day 3 off days n total why would Andujar need a day after going 3-5 with a homer &amp; triple I‚Äôm confused @AndrewMarchand
Hold up lemme understand this  - Didi mired in ridiculous slump couple days off ok I get it but Tues - Wed rained out Thursday travel day 3 off days n total why would Andujar need a day after going 3-5 with a homer &amp; triple I‚Äôm confused @JackCurryYES
@reneegraziano Yup that‚Äôs usually how it works
Andujar graduated from the top üíØ next will be Torres next up will be Florial - Sheffield - Abreau - Adams - Madina &amp; I think Loisigna jumps behind Abreau n top 30 &amp; 100
@thegooglefact Google stole all that yahoo shine hello gmail !!!
Wonder how Boone plays tomorrow out with the personal catcher thing or maybe the day game after night game reason but Sanchize hit 2 HR tonight so u want him n - Stanton hit 1 so that‚Äôs ya DH spot and Frazier played will does Gardy sit again
Dunno what the deal is but I‚Äôm sick of yankees giving up runs on the bases - Boone needs to get his coaches and or players n order @JackCurryYES
Rise &amp; shine &amp; give God the glory glory !!!!
Gleyber was really bad today and cost the Yankees 3 runs unacceptable brain freeze today can‚Äôt have that behind CC he needs the defenders be on A games period
@_BirdieJackson Yikes
@baseball_ref So what second Game he got touched bldont care bout walks only runs
Ohhh myyy üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç https://t.co/8IxHUHVD9p
@YankeesGirl2113 Def don‚Äôt need Harper would be ridiculous to spend that money - now with that said we need a pitcher or 2 or 3 so that would be the wise investment
@JackCurryYES I saw something that said the Yankee games were cxled are both done over or is one continuing from 3-3 so technically 13 innings to go
understand records sold &amp; certifications isn‚Äôt what they used to be people are now going platinum &amp; gold thru streams which isn‚Äôt a sold record or album - people r going gold &amp; plat having sold 100kbalbums total which n another date &amp; time would be a flop
Don‚Äôt let the fact the Yankees r winning hide the fact that Tanaka has a 5.03 era which means he sucks as bad as the guys we woulda got had he left
@bsmeazy No way not even performing at double A warranting promotion-swing &amp; miss is real
@BNightengale Maybe this needs to be fixed it tarnished a future HOF player and if it‚Äôs not performance enhancing it is indeed a glitch
@InfoBoosting Send me one I‚Äôll promote it
Gardy doesn‚Äôt resign Stanton takes over left now u have  more room for everyone with an open DH
@LivPopeCams I dunno maybe cuz it‚Äôs my page what I selling pussy - hit dogs howl
@YankeesPR Good thing @RiverAveBlues doesn‚Äôt make the decisions cuz they def left this one out of the latest What to do with drury saga
@Fyocca123 All star game naw Altuve gonna win the vote but he‚Äôll be n thya mix
@GloriousQueenn Same thing I been doing all my life
So is it safe to say all these women pretending to be traveling the world yet never post pics of anyone they‚Äôre traveling with are escorting via the DM - don‚Äôt Blow a gasket I‚Äôm asking for a friend
Drake going on tour with migos y‚Äôall here for it ??
@AndrewMarchand Yankees will be fine just the way they are hopefully they win division and he bounces boston out the playoffs !!!!!
Yankee all stars   C- Sanchize   SS - Gregorius   RF - Judge   DH - Stanton   P - Severino   RP - Chapman
And all of a sudden Stanton is batting 252 with a 855 ops
@mamajeweldollaz @stacy_chick Good thing life won‚Äôt change at all after this u expected , irrelevant then of events
When Yankees get ü¶Ö &amp; Drury back I think they‚Äôll rid themselves of the last reliever &amp; Austin gets demoted but moving Andujar isn‚Äôt an option he need to play and improve at this level period !!!!!
@stacy_chick Being factual is the best defense against slander
Can‚Äôt even advocate for u bro 5 runs in one inning against the As not acceptable gotta stop the bleeding dude the As r terrible
@InfoBoosting need this ASAP I‚Äôll promote on Mu social media !!
@BleacherReport And saying dumb shit like that is why he won‚Äôt ever get a coaching job well amongst other reasons
Funny when motherfuckas so worried bout u they can‚Äôt help but be consumed with shit u don‚Äôt think twice about - but if they had any life they wouldn‚Äôt be worried about yours !!!!! Get a life
@billmaher who is this fucking idiot u have on ya show like seriously I blame ya team for even booking him and he‚Äôs a Congressmen from cali like seriously common man why even give them a voice on ya show
@BryanHoch Love this kid as well but U just hit a homer and ya batting 350 wtf u bunting for we using the hottest hitter in the team for sac opportunities
@Fresko024 Smart move they gave away an out and got 1 run that worked out swimmingly
Kids hitting 350 just went deep why is he sad bunting giving away an out - shoulda swing the bat in my opinion
@BrendanKutyNJ Kinda of obvious it‚Äôs not working Gray and his personal catcher can get the hell outta NY
Cashman has done an amazing job rebuilding the Yankees on the fly w/o tanking but the Sonny Gray deal isn‚Äôt one of the better ones - take solace n knowing they didn‚Äôt have room for Fowler - Mateo is stinking it up and KAP hasn‚Äôt pitched since he was 12
Hmmmn wonder if Gary Sanchez snuck behind the plate for this game - how bout it‚Äôs not Sanchize it‚Äôs Gray &amp; the personal catcher shit needs to go away as Gray does @JackCurryYES
51 pitches 3-2/3 inning 0 hits 2 w 3ks and Sheffield was pulled any reason why @swbrailriders @jimcallisMLB
Awwwwe shit my man ‚Äú handle like van exel ‚Äú is coming to NY it‚Äôs about to be litttttttt
@SiirBrock U got it
Bro how many times we gonna fucking do this shit stop using Betances for multiple innings wtf how many times
@SiirBrock Whoever made them joggers tellem I need a pair
@SiirBrock No sir def is not
Joe Girardi somewhere like damn was benching Sanchize &amp; not answering the bullpen phone for Cash even worth it these guys can‚Äôt lose even with Boone trying to give away games
@mondo_muzic Man facts I‚Äôm sure action Jackson is still sickbhe couldn‚Äôt get along with management
Summer is here won‚Äôt see another sleeve until February #20inchgunz https://t.co/14jlAz9DlL
Joe Girardi is somewhere sick Aaron Boone gets to manage this team - at this point yankees are manager proof cuz Boone has definitely made some bone head moves but as previously stated manager proof the way binder joe would lovem
Sears - Green - Swanson - Whitlock  and Loisigna all have outstanding results so far we know Johnny ‚öæÔ∏è has A1 stuff future 2-3 What r these other guys looking like ceiling wise ??? @JonathanMayo
They honored my mom tonight @CityTechNews - thank u for everything we r now retired !!!!! https://t.co/A0GYry3izn
7- Acevedo looks good dealing with blister   8- Perez looks bad really bad   9- adams overated as I thought from the beginning maybe back to the pen upside maybe Chad Green   10- Medina could be higher let‚Äôs c hear he‚Äôs headed to  Charleston soon
One month in  Yankee top 10 prospect list   1-Torres looks amazing  2- Andujar defense just fine bat is as big time as we thought  3- Sheffield looks really good   4- Abreau just getting back from  injury   5- Loisigna new entry he‚Äôs ‚Äúa guy ‚Äú   6-Florial swing &amp; miss worrisome@
Just preaching about Johnny Loisigna bearing a beast as he gives up an 0-2 homer Fuuuuck
@JonathanMayo not yet but n a couple games we are gonna have to speak about Jonny Loisigna for this huge jump into ya top üíØ like unranked into the top 50 mid season jump - will b 23 all season - stuff insane - control pinpoint &amp; most importantly looks healthy
@jimcallisMLB not gonna say anything yet but a couple more games we are gonna have to speak about Jonny Loisigna for this huge jump into ya top üíØ like unranked into the top 50
The Yanks have to get better defensively &amp; the coaches have to be better. Yanks have run into the second most outs on bases so far this season that‚Äôs not acceptable &amp; Aaron Boone has been a bad manager - winning in spite of mistakes is huge but that has to be cleaned up
The Yankees are playing like this &amp; Gardy - Stanton - Sanchize - Hicks - Walker still no ü¶Ö yet and the rest haven‚Äôt even found the rhythm yet beware ‚öæÔ∏è !!!!!
@AndrewMarchand They don‚Äôt deserve a radio telecast the team sucks and the arena is too dark
@MichaelRapaport @NBA @nyknicks Let‚Äôs get the roster In order cuz White frankly nobody gonna win with that roster and 2 think they coulda had Spyda Mitchell
@RealSkipBayless Bro u just sound dumb it‚Äôs  bout time for me to unfollow u... I‚Äôm no lebron fan but the level of hate u demonstrate is inordinate and quite frankly kinda weird like some hidden feelings ur trying to conceal
Monday is here another chance for a great &amp; productive week get up get out &amp; get something !!! Remember creating ya own opportunities &amp; having ya own is the greatest feeling In The world !!!!!!
@BrendanKutyNJ hmmm I just saw that you compared Gardy 2 Stanton n the mail bag u gotta be kidding right difference in ops around 300 power numbers &amp; rbi as well u had to be kidding - Stanton isn‚Äôt good but Gardy has been terrible let‚Äôs not mix them up
Blankenship being even remotely in consideration for this WVA post says much more about WVA then it does about him !!!! Just sayin
@Buster_ESPN I hate when people say he‚Äôs on pace for as if a sprinter can run a marathons race like he would run a 200 - who cares what the pace is 30 games in whenbu literally have 132 to go
@JoeFaceBecker Yes indeed they look amazing
@Robfeliz Indeed and he‚Äôs just begun he better the Montgomery I‚Äôve said that since last season
@missfree Stop it Free
@KingDavidsPen Fuck a petition justbdont but the shits and they will go away
@BNightengale Wasn‚Äôt good enough earlier this week but whatever ü§î
How bout them yankee Rookies
@lazofficial @LazAlonso2 My bad bro that‚Äôs my other page lmao
Knowing ya value goes both ways don‚Äôt be the only one that‚Äôs thinks that highly of u - it‚Äôs absolutely counterproductive
@JoeFaceBecker Decatur
@CeoFrizz Yes indeed the youngsters look good Tyler - Gleyber &amp; Miguel all look like they belong n the bigs for a long time
@Jwebb2413 @BryanHoch @DidiG18 Didi always spoke english and 3-4 other languages or something like that don‚Äôt make ill advised parallels- Didi and Gleyber have absolutely no similarities
@JoeFaceBecker Wipes forehead !!!
@JoeFaceBecker 5-3 Astros that quick
@JoeFaceBecker That quick jinxed them that quick
@JoeFaceBecker Blew it
@JoeFaceBecker Looking good actually looks great I‚Äôll take this road trip
@eboland11 Speaking of hyperbole what I do wanna know is where the Yankee prospects rank on base ball America‚Äôs update anyone moving up anyone new crack the 100
@BryanHoch What yankees moved up and in baseball America‚Äôs first prospect updates
https://t.co/SqcJrluHXD
@TI3RRV_ ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î
@TI3RRV_ Me
I agree but we can wait til allstar and see where we r
@TI3RRV_ We got that swag I am ya swag !!üòÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hate to c Gumby hurt but if you watch the Yankees then u know this injury not crushing German will be fine and pitch just as good as Montgomery did so knock it off
@eboland11 Bro nobody worth noting wanted him cut or benched anyone who has a clue didn‚Äôt want that - getting warm he‚Äôll heat up always does please refrain from hyperbolic tweets
What Yankees r on baseball America‚Äôs updated top üíØ my log in is messed up
@BryanHoch As he should he‚Äôs deserved a shot
Damn i guess Dillon Tate isn‚Äôt it he tricked me with a couple great starts !!!!
@mamajeweldollaz Not the same Energy w/o ‚Äú bitch ‚Äú n the joke wanna wake your significant other or better half  just doesn‚Äôt hit right
@BryanHoch Very simple Domingo German gets his shot and cashes in !!!! Done the end
@TI3RRV_ Me getting on top of u
@TI3RRV_ Like how
@Robfeliz I‚Äôm n atl no k - cone or flash
@Bif0924 Naw hate we sent him to the chi I liked him
Kind of annoying MLB network is dick riding the Verlander performance that was indeed superb but please realize its 3-0 which means the vaunted Astros offense hasn‚Äôt scored either &amp; has 2 runs n 2 games to this point just saying Bob Costas
Sanchize !!!!!
@BryanHoch Don‚Äôt think anyone cares how many ks they have not the 1 run since they landed is the issue
@TI3RRV_ Why must u say dumb shit over twitter
@missmilo24 By hoe
@_mermaidbarbie Back soon n a new city very soon
@Jadie_Padie Exactly my point just like the late Hugh Hefner but if he started spewing hatred racism &amp;!everything else trump has stood for he‚Äôd  lose his urban cool card as well not rocket science why doesn‚Äôt Kanye get it - excuse lack of punctuation I‚Äôm thoroughly disappointed
Fuck the fact that he said he loved trump and tried to rationalize it with rap videos from 2002 before trump wired all his beliefs all his thoughts all his actions with racism and hatred Kanye is so lost so ignorant and indefensible
Please tell me this shit Kanye said on @TMZ was some type of spoof  joke something not real -please tell me this man didn‚Äôt just say slavery of 400 years was a choice please please please say he didn‚Äôt just do that
@JonathanMayo I‚Äôm starting to get pissed off media is saying Andujar has never been a prospect the kid is 23 been on the top üíØ for the last 2 seasons and been ranked in the 3B top 10 even longer - hell media gets paid to know prospects so they should know prospects so annoying
@TI3RRV_ Go back to bed üõè
@TI3RRV_ Stop drinking
@TI3RRV_ Lol
U wanna wake yo bitch up? Jangle yo keysüòÇüòÇü§ìü§°ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@CeoFrizz Yes they do 1 or 2
@JoeFaceBecker Yanks will get 2 I hope that‚Äôll be a nice west coast trip 5-2 anything better would be icing
@JoeFaceBecker As did I smh had shots at the end Hicks swinging wild like he n lol league &amp; Didi didn‚Äôt come thru this time
Not mad at sonny Gray today I‚Äôll take 6 innings 2 runs everyday and twice on Sunday
@JonathanMayo meanwhile everyone is talking about Andujar and his D yes Drury had 3 errors today not this week or this month but today n Scranton ü§îüòåü§î
Can we please stop acting like it matter who catches Sonny Gray he suck bottom line - the end it‚Äôs not Sanchize or Romine or Johnny Bench it‚Äôs him
@SiziSev Hilarious
Ohh wow didn‚Äôt realize that well he can‚Äôt be an asshole and hit under 250 with no power he might wanna be a nice guy
@AndrewMarchand A-Rod should do games alone
Traded Yankees   Fowler-  batting 264 ops under 700   Mateo - batting 164 w/4sbs OPS under 600   KAP - hasn‚Äôt pitched yet   Guzman 4IP 0era 1 Game n high A  Littel getting rocked   Clarkin getting rocked   Rutherford 364 avg with no power
@seanmohen @Buster_ESPN If u think Andujar and Torres are backups you‚Äôre misinformed they are the futures
@lookin4oz1980 @Evelynn_Nickole Get ya eyes checked
That quickly the Yankees have the third best record n baseball
@Evelynn_Nickole Don‚Äôt look shit like me
@JonathanMayo On another note if Drury comes back &amp;  does anything but DH &amp; pick up his first base mitt we have serious issues Andujar is a beast period the end - Drury is a serviceable third baseman  Andujar is a ‚≠êÔ∏è
@JonathanMayo Lol Yeah I think he may have but I meant Andujar reminded me of Beltran mannerisms - bat speed and swag while he was n Trenton &amp; Scranton meaning Andujar n minors
@JonathanMayo I c a lot of Adrian Beltre n Andujar offensively obviously long way to go before we can actually make that comparison but he def reminds me of Beltre even n the minors
Very disappointing the Yankees won‚Äôt commit to Miguel Andujar at @ least n the short he deserves vote of confidence he certainly would be ROY @ this point if not 4 Otani -I imagine that‚Äôs what yanks do not commit @ send down ROY level players @JackCurryYES
Just to put the Sanchize n perspective he‚Äôs 1st n runs 3rd n doubles 1 n homers 1st n RBIs 4th in slugging &amp; 7th n ops all while batting 193 &amp; thats MLB not just AL - safe to say when he gets hot he‚Äôll be the best offensive catcher by a zillion miles not even close
@JackCurryYES don‚Äôt agree with pinch hitting for Torreyes kinda worked out but why Toe has good speed is a contact hitter not 2 mention he‚Äôs been super clutch why why why now they lose the DH tontop it off bad move - almost guarantee a toe hit n that spot
@AndrewMarchand don‚Äôt agree with pinch hitting for Torreyes kinda worked out but why Toe has good speed and is a contact hitter not 2 mention he‚Äôs been super clutch why why why
Yanks lead the majors in runs (146), runs per game (6.08), home runs (39), HR per game (1.63), OBP (.352), slugging (.475), OPS (.826) and TB (392). Rank second in walks (111) and extra base hits (94) - that‚Äôs with bad Sanchize - Stanton Gardner no ü¶Ö &amp; a blind Drury
@TI3RRV_ Roll over and hit the lights I‚Äôm still sleepy too
@JonathanMayo if Johnni Loisigna keeps pitching like this an immediate promotion will be n order  &amp; he should def be top 75 on midelseason update - whatcha think ??
@TI3RRV_ My back shots gone get u right
Walk it off !!!!!! Sanchize https://t.co/aRgLnTI7Fh
I mean I imagine at some point Didi ,Judge , Austin &amp; Andujar will slow down Hicks - Sanchize Stanton Gardy &amp; Walker  will begin to hit
@Kelvinb78665830 I sure did sticking to the regiment u sent me
Quietly Yanks have best offense n majors and Stanton isn‚Äôt hitting nor is Sanchize &amp; still no Bird but quite frankly they couldn‚Äôt have asked for much more outta first base with TA
@JonathanMayo is Tyler Austin‚Äôs bat this legit cuz right now he looks like a 250 25-30 homer 850 ops guy which even if a Bird comes back has serious value on the market D isn‚Äôt as bad as people say he‚Äôs serviceable
Didi is insane right now woooooow !!!
On the farm - Sheffield - Tate - losiagna - Stephan r all dealing Acevedo was before he had the blister issue but my guy Frecier Perez having his issues
@TI3RRV_ Very representative dont U have a man
@TI3RRV_ Actually said he is out of the sunken place
@BryanHoch @MLB Maybe some good fortune will turn things around for them - wonder when baseball gonna award Tyler Austin his hit from the other day
@TI3RRV_ You‚Äôd look nuts
@TI3RRV_ U doin a whole lot today
@TI3RRV_ For  what
Fun fact Didi wasn‚Äôt even playing at this time last year
@TVbytheNumbers still looking for them Monday cable numbers
@TI3RRV_ Say it again babe
@Robfeliz @BryanHoch Man I dunno take ya time Greg - TA ballin !!!
@JackCurryYES question of the day Jack is YESNDIDI gonna hit 35 bombs this year - I say yup
@JackCurryYES Tell Drury dust off that 2nd base &amp; 1B glove he will be what Walker was supposed to be before he‚Äôs Cut
@andaqueviaje @JackCurryYES Babip will be high as long as he smoke everything
@NUYORKCITY @JackCurryYES Severino - Green  - Chapman * - Judge - Sanchez - Stanton - Didi *   * will be deserving but Fans will have to get out and vote
@Robfeliz @BryanHoch Yes indeed then they will have full compliment of horses
@BryanHoch Kids a beast will be rookie of the year if the guy n Anaheim falters at all
@JonathanMayo I love it when a plan comes together Andujar on his way runner up rookie of the year if The dude n Anaheim falters he‚Äôll be ya rookie of the year
@Buster_ESPN Absolutely rigth Buster the conditions have not been So Cal but he‚Äôs still raking w/o the shoulder injury last season his numbers would‚Äôve been even more unworldly- let‚Äôs c I‚Äôm predicting 280 avg  45 homers 115 runs &amp; 110 RBIs
@TheRealDaytime @drocktrot Reality is if people watch and money is generated this question has already been answered
@CNN Apology not accepted go to hell just shows she didn‚Äôt do her due diligence
@TMZ Why do u continue to even post the dumb shit she says that the only motivation to say such ridiculously blasphemous things - tMZ time
@AndrewMarchand Keep the jz  ‚Äúreasonable doubt ‚Äú references minimal ‚Äú brainless vs famous and he‚Äôll be aight
Keep ya head up keep pushing and run ya own race don‚Äôt look left or right and u will get what‚Äôs coming to u. N time
@JonHeyman That‚Äôs 2 bad calls no overturns cu the yankee play was flagrantly bad
@TI3RRV_ Stop talking tough marshmallow
@JackCurryYES How can that ever happen like seriously how can u watchbthat from multiple angles and not get that correct
@ItsjustJimmy @Buster_ESPN Both losers same principle begging for any glory mets nets will never run NY wether knicks - yankees go 0-82 or 0 - 162
@ItsjustJimmy @Buster_ESPN Just like a net fan gloating 20 games into the season when the reality is y‚Äôall won‚Äôt be around come all Star - I guess u take what u can when u root for the guys n queens
@TI3RRV_ Cornball shit only dick n her is mine
@Buster_ESPN As amazing as that stat line would be it will never happen
@bsmeazy Better be 2nd the way Andujar is swinging the bat the future is Gleyber @ 2nd &amp; Andujar @ 3rd
@bsmeazy He needs to play better not playing well at all b AA Tampa prob won‚Äôt be promoted at this rate
@TI3RRV_ Don‚Äôt u have a man ??
@TI3RRV_ U mine we win all day every day
Yankee  top prospect graduations  Andujar - Torres   New top üíØ prospects  Tate - Acevedo - Medina - Estrada - loisigna -    Total top 100s  Sheffield - Florial - Adams. - Abreau  - Madina - loisigna - maybe Acevedo - Tate - Estrada
@tmiddaugh39 @Joelsherman1 and wasn‚Äôt much of anything before
Better be Yankee Lineup tomorrow   LF Gardner  RF Judge  SS Didi  DH Stanton  C Sanchize  CF Hicks  3B Andujar  1B Austin  2B Torres    Super excited if Stanton &amp; Sanchize get going u looking at 6-8 runs a game   !!!!!
Hearing Gleyber is on the way to NY  so umm Wade or a pitcher might be headed down cuz it better not be Andujar - maybe Domingo
All of a sudden Andujar is batting 255 with an 810 ops &amp; below 15 pct K rate hmmmm Torres needs to be working out at 2nd base period @Jonmayo we were right yet again
@keithlaw Never heard so much chitter chatter bout getting that ass beat either u kick my butt or I kick yours either way not complaining about things I can control gettem out throw him out but don‚Äôt complain once he‚Äôs on
Yankees digging a nice lil hole for themselves Boston is the definition of running away &amp; hiding still early but when leads are n double digits it‚Äôs always a mountain to climb gonna need a nice 20-5 streak
Can we stop the Torres @ 3rd talk Miguel is a beast and will be fine at the hot corner everyone wanna give wade 5 years of reprieve but yet send Andujar down after 25 Abs
Never been a fan of sonny gray would‚Äôve saved that package added Frazier &amp; Adams and got Fulmer or even done a prospect for prospect trade with the braves they have a glutton on the mound !!! Bad live cash but n theory itbsounded good
This is the best yankee lineup until Bird is healthy &amp; Austin sits &amp; Torres is called up &amp; Toe is utility think Andujar is about to go on a tear &amp; become the 280 20 homer 800 ops guy I said he would Drury who ??? https://t.co/LXwr4I228X
@MichaelRapaport Common mike u telling me U don‚Äôt remember the release date of ya first movie or when u got that first million dollar check
@DaBreo_ @alexgz27 @BryanHoch Name the ten better
What is this unwavering confidence n Tyler Wade it‚Äôs getting more obvious he can‚Äôt hit major league pitching yet they pretend Torrea doesn‚Äôt need to be playing 2nd base instead of third can u explain this pleases @AndrewMarchand
What is this unwavering confidence n Tyler Wade it‚Äôs getting more obvious he can‚Äôt hit major league pitching yet they pretend Torrea doesn‚Äôt need to be playing 2nd base instead of third can u explain this pleases @JonathanMayo
Ellsbury - Frazier- Hicks  - Bird - Drury - kahnle - Warren - Heller - all been on DH already   Wade 091 - walker 189  - Stanton 191 - Sanchez 203 batting averages   Not enough characters to even begin talking bout bullpen   So with that 8-8 sounds amazing
So why wouldn‚Äôt Andujar be playing  tonight smh he starts heating up and u give him a break after a day off can I please make sense of this @JackCurryYES
New work out plan started today bout to be all lean muscle no bulk !!! https://t.co/BdUMjfEjN9
If the Red Sox play 15-2 ball for the rest of the season I‚Äôll concede the season - people get so amped up &amp; we‚Äôre not even in the 20 game area - relax people talk to me after 100 games I promise you yankees will be right there
Hell he‚Äôs as bad as wade  Torres needs to play second Andujar needs to play third
@IDONTGIVEAFLIP I dunno meatball maybe saving character space - how bout u unfollow me and you‚Äôll never have that issue seeing numbers again
Kenny Smith is my guy an Arch Bishop Malloy Queens guy but coach of the NY Knicks I dunno - think this search should start &amp; bend in BK Bishop Loughlin
@CNN He‚Äôs a idiot for sure living in his own world
@TMZ The facts y‚Äôall even ask her music questions is a joke fuck outta here
@MariahLynBoss I‚Äôm down for the collab u do the record I do richie D drops take dat take dat
@bigsantiago That‚Äôs my point people / media  should not be worried about Gleyber being called up he‚Äôll be here soon enough let‚Äôs handle the issues at hand - the team on the field is the worry
Why media &amp; fans screaming bout Gleyber when Stanton is terrible Betances is terrible Tanaka is terrible Wade is terrible Walker is terrible Sanchize is terrible shouldn‚Äôt  everyone be worried what‚Äôs terrible in Ny instead of what‚Äôs n Scranton
@SiirBrock Facts trying to be like u !!!
https://t.co/AHbWrHRpB5
I‚Äôm guaranteeing you someone with no record sales , streams or records sold would be n the mix for any awards except maybe BET awards
Sad day when  ‚Äú cash/ catch me outside ‚Äú girl is nominated for a billboard award for best female rap artist - what I don‚Äôt understand is why people are mad they downloaded / streamed &amp;!bought her music so what did they reasonably expect
Maybe now that Andujar is hitting we can stop pretending like the Yankees need a 3b &amp; Torres can go back to splitting time between the 3 non 1b infield spots
@BryanHoch The question is why is he being recalled
https://t.co/Rciqks8bcY
Andujar 2-4 with 2 just miss Home Runs kids coming around let‚Äôs give him some at bats before Gleyber switches positions like seriously why do other players have longer leash ‚Äú Tyler Wade ‚Äú with no where near the upside
@BaseballAmerica Guessing intl national league player of week doesn‚Äôt make the hot sheet gotcha
@BenBadler No respect for this prospect with the glaring omission of Gleyber Torres or Johnny lasagna
what‚Äôs worse 1) getting arrested 4 waiting 4 someone @ Starbucks 2) being taken out in cuffs 4 waiting 4 someone n Starbucks 3) being taken 2 jail 4 waiting 4 someone n Starbucks 4) being held for 8 hrs 4 waiting 4 someone n Starbucks - ask me all unacceptable Starbucks
Beyonc√© isn‚Äôt human - she actually a national treasure
You would think with all the cameras &amp; people that Starbucks would‚Äôve refrained from being the next company on the fuck off list ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but now they much incur  the wrath
@fangraphs This proves to me that defense matters well rounded players will always have war edge judge will be n this group very soon
Not the size of the lion n the fight  It‚Äôs the size of the fight in the lion   Do remember
@JonathanMayo Dillon Tate &amp; Jonny Lasagna looking like  top üíØ guys thus far - Torres - Andujar will be replaced by  Medina / Tate / loisgna
@mamajeweldollaz Nope but he started a brawl after being hit by pitch - man after my own heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
I think I love Tyler Austin a lil bit !!!!
@YoureIt_Not_It Not giving up on anyone just turned channel tonight I‚Äôm back tomorrow for Tanaka time
I‚Äôm not watching this bullshit any longer fuck the Yankees fuck Severino fuck Stanton fuck judge and the rest of them bums
Severino has got to start coming thru n big games like an ace never comes thru n the clutch thus far n his career
US chart preview update: Cardi B's 'Invasion of Privacy' now pacing for #1 with 215-225k units (90-100k pure). Pretty damn good if u ask me
@BNightengale @BovadaLV And it‚Äôs April so do we really care what all these ridiculous odds are
I guess yankee fans can take solace n knowing 2  things (1) nobody cares about the Mets (2) the Red Sox r due for a bad streak they won‚Äôt play 8-1 ball forever
Bullpen loses another one unreal
@bsmeazy Scored 7 today with hat minor league lineup shiuldve been enough
@bsmeazy Disagree Drury - Walker - Andujar Toe - and supposedly wade was a top prospect no team has a killer 1-9 maybe Astros or Sawx but u don‚Äôt need an all star at every spot actually kinda wack to have that but the bullpen has blown leads or they‚Äôd have 2 more n w column
@ish_since89 Was supposed to be easy for yankees 2 Tampa - Bmore and Toronto 6 of 9 n the friendly confines meanwhile boston looks amazing again today coming back down 7
@bsmeazy Yup no bueno bullpen has really been the culprit before today starters have been ok
Montgomery spotted 5-0 lead and can‚Äôt get thru 4 unbelievable
If u didn‚Äôt think shit was real before Romine - Austin - Walker - Toe &amp; Andujar that‚Äôs todays infield - why the hell would Didi get the day off with off day tomorrow not 2 mention Peterson n left !!!
Pitching isn‚Äôt the issue would‚Äôve been undefeated based on starting pitching the bullpen has let us down as have the bats period - and German will be very good while CC is down
Yankees had Toronto - Tampa &amp; Bmore starting the season perfect way to get out quick &amp; alleviate some pressure quite frankly they look weak right now !!! Boston &amp; houston look much better so far much
@mamajeweldollaz Facts
Woooow yankee DL is crazy CC - Drury - Hicks - Ellsbury- Frazier  - Bird &amp; McKinney not to mention wade being sick &amp; Sanchize cramping up
Holder has to be sent down and German comes up I mean it only makes sense at this point
@baseball_ref Funny Stanton isn‚Äôt on list anyone by virtue of being a yankee he should never be omitted from the top name on any list he qualifies for
@ovationtv @janizbee2 Allen Shore of course best lawyer ever
@clintfrazier Yes indeed let‚Äôs go Red Thunder we gotta make up for lost time
Do yaself a favor binge  watch ‚Äú Boston Legal ‚Äú on Saturday‚Äôs &amp; ‚Äú The Practice ‚Äú on Sunday‚Äôs on @ovationtv do yaself a favor tell me what u think of 2 of my favorite shows
@ovationtv  quickly becoming my favorite channel I work so I have to DVR ‚Äú Boston Legal ‚Äú &amp; now ‚Äú The Practice ‚Äú  but you guys made my day with those two shows
@HaniDav83 Definitely as a pro all u do is shoot and work J Kidd went from no threes to all threes later n his career - Ben will get the shot and when he does woooooow
@HaniDav83 If say for a veteran 16-8-8 is solid and all star worthy that‚Äôs basically a triple double if he made feee throws he‚Äôd be 20-8-8 all star and all NBA numbers nothing to do with rookie I said once n a decade type talent
@CrimMinds_CBS Damn I missed it when can I catch on demand
@JonathanMayo Trenton looks pretty ridiculous so I guess as Acevedo - Sheffield &amp; Tate roll as will the kids.. I fully expect Abreau healthy soon &amp; in Trenton buy July !!!! Perez &amp; Losiagna if pitching well should move fast especially Johnny with his 40 man situation
@piercebmw Injured last year not clear on ya point
-Equated ‚Äú2 sides‚Äù re Charlottesville -Called black athetes, ‚Äúsons of bitches‚Äù -Attacked John Lewis -Silent when black men abused/killed by bad cops -Called African countries ‚Äúshit-holes‚Äù -Said Haitians have AIDS  If u support or are Trump, pls spare us the #MLK50 tweets. Really.
@JonathanMayo  the Yankees advanced A rotation is pretty ridiculous  gonna be exciting to watch  -Perez  - Abreau - losigiana - all n same rotation 4 potential top 100 players Florial starting n Tampa as well
@MLBPipeline @MiLB @mlbbowman @RhettBollinger @AdamMcCalvy @BryanHoch @m_sheldon @brianmctaggart @adamdberry @AJCassavell @scottmerkin Yankees advanced A rotations is ridiculous
They say Ben Simmons can‚Äôt shoot but no matter how u look at  it he‚Äôs averaging 16 - 8 - 8 his rookie season - mid range Game &amp; ability to go up &amp; down the floor alleviates lack of 3 point shooting - much more efficient as well the 3 will come he‚Äôll be best player n league
@SEVeNNyC Thanks and yup I‚Äôve heard that as well
My prediction the Yankees will hit a lot of homers already have 10
@BryanHoch No length tho still impressive but need it thru 6-7 not not 5-6 or 4 n the case of Gray
@rileyreidx3 so I can‚Äôt get a follow Riley ??
Feels good to just be yaself - u already won if U stay true to u !!!
@swbrailriders Still waiting on the 18 roster
@ChasRiverDogs Waiting on that 18 roster
Half the battle of winning &amp; fixing yaself is taking responsibility for the part u played n moments that negatively define u - can‚Äôt play victim forever
@swbrailriders So r we gonna get a roster since  media day would imply I have a team to media
Thanks guys love ya !!!!! https://t.co/3BfnVRKgix
@rileyreidx3 follow me I wanna dm u
@leahmichellere1 But we made money what‚Äôs ya point meatball https://t.co/4QAW8UzzWe
@MarvinDeanbao35 Stop dick riding fam even worse look cock sucka
Lmao niggas stay blaming me for everything but I guess that was my fault as well - amazing
@TampaTarpons Sweet thank you
@realOconnor614 Indeed I am a prospect hugger which is why I prefer to use them in worthwhile deals &amp; until Gray he can go 6-7  with a sub 3.2 era with consistency I would‚Äôve preferred to hug them guys a lil longer and got a worthwhile deal out of 3 top üíØ tho rehabbing kids
@DK973 If his first game wasn‚Äôt a continuation of the 13 he threw here last season u might actually have a point
@realOconnor614 I agree But cash has been enamored with Gray for a while now I would‚Äôve sat on the package built a lil more stock n minorsadded frazier or adams  and used it for Hamels at trade deadline
Yeah I agree just wanna temper all he accolades til he‚Äôs actually done something &amp; yesterdays  game didn‚Äôt overwhelm me - we shall c I mean it was the As right
Not as bad as Kapler but still a very bad weekend for Boone from Betances 2 innings - not playing Austin after a 2 HR game - walking Donaldson in favor of pitching to Smoake -?going with Holder in that spot  the list goes on bad weekend my guy just bad
@BryanHoch Overall not as bad as Kapler but still a very bad weekend for Boone from Betances 2 innings - not playing Austin after a 2 HR game - walking Donaldson in favor of pitching to Smoake &amp; going with Holder in that spot  the list goes on bad weekend my guy just bad
@MissRaquel4X Recently moved to Miami would love to have a drink ü•É
Opening day postponed for snow n NY !!! I wonder if they r skipping Montgomery &amp; Severino gets the ball or giving everyone an extra day of rest @AndrewMarchand
@SdotKdot756 If u think Trey Burke hasn‚Äôt earned a spot for next season &amp;!shouldn‚Äôt  be given the reigns u don‚Äôt know hoops - pick would be much better served with a 3&amp;D 3 man then yet another PG added to the stable Burke is balling u still have - glutton if 1s need a true 3
I guarantee if u masturbate first u won‚Äôt make that trip !!!
@swbrailriders  when r y‚Äôall gonna release the rosters and rotation - don‚Äôt u open up this week
@TampaTarpons   when r y‚Äôall gonna release the rosters and rotation - don‚Äôt u open up this week
@TrentonThunder  when r y‚Äôall gonna release the rosters and rotation - don‚Äôt u open up this week
Othani pitches 6 and gives up 3 runs to the As &amp; y‚Äôall acting like he complete  Game shutout the Astros with 10ks - I mean really r we bragging about 4.5 era vs the double As ??
3-1 &amp; 2-2 so much different 178 to go smh already dont like the Boone  hire very questionable moves thru series  one
Judge not hitting - Hicks hurt - McKinley hurt -Betances sucks - Robertson touched up  - kahnle touched up  - gray can‚Äôt get past 4 -just the first series of the season ladies and gents
Ummmm Girardi anyone not as nasty as Kaylee n Philly but def questionable mjved by yankees new manager 2 days n a row
@realOconnor614 Nope archer - Fullmer - tearhen - or anyone else packaged with them guys hell of u add Frazier &amp; adams to what they sent u coulda gotten anyone
@realOconnor614 Might wanna pick another day to defend Gray - 89 pitches 10 baserunners thru 4 not acceptable i will give u 8ks &amp; 1 earned run but ummm still not acceptable the bullpen has to get 5 Easter innings
Ummm coulda used that prospect package for another pitcher that‚Äôs how - as he‚Äôs relieved here n the 4th with a man on 1st no outs
Fact is Yankees will regret the Sonny Gray Trade , I already do !!! Mateo , KAP &amp; Fowler for a guy who can‚Äôt get u out the 4th inning fucking ridiculous
Yankee prospect predictions   Torres starting n majors by all star break   Andujar plays well on both sides of the ball while with injuries n abundance   Adams no love   German 6th started pitches well  Cessa 7th starter   Medina &amp; Perez top 100 midseason
@BryanHoch @MAndujarPapa Guess the Yankees aren‚Äôt worried bout that extra year and setting that clock back after all
Well I blame Bone head Boone for bringing him back for a 2nd inning shoulda been in Robertsons hands
Def blew this game for the Yankees all Betances nobody else
I‚Äôm a fan but Betances has been killing the Yankees since last all star break  can‚Äôt continue on
@Babyice4k No just wondering who the fools across the room with the security guards are
@Joelsherman1 Was def gonna tell u the person who bet in Austin lost
Betances killing me right now 2 games 2 HR common bro
@atTheTrack7 @Joelsherman1 &amp; Andujar both need time n 3A to turn them clocks back
@JoshRogers13 Where r u headed ??
PSA if nobody knows who u r but asks who u r because u have Security u don‚Äôt need Security !!!
@AndrewMarchand It‚Äôs terrible he shoulda backed down and spared everyone that horrible call - but guessing if we only have to hear it after a homer it‚Äôs tolerable
@BigNick__GLOE Facts and I love it
@JackCurryYES @dcone36 Good now he can leave that FB on the shelf cuz that ain‚Äôt it !!!
@TorresGleyber @Topsheff42 Good shit ride for ya boys
My bad Drury !! Ok I c u !!!
For some reason the Yankees having  Drury @ third doesn‚Äôt have the same ring as Andujar on the lineup card - it feels like Drury is a weak link when u c the lineup card u get excited seeing Andujar &amp; Torres not that same energy seeing Drury , wade or Walker
@mamajeweldollaz Think about Biz all the time I miss him 2
Damn is Hicks hurt already shit 1 Game in ???? I guess the  Stanton n LF starts immediately &amp; YanKees could all of a sudden use one of the 2 injured players Frazier or Ells

@JonHeyman When they go high we go Giancaaaaarlo stantonian blast for Giancarlo Stanton
@BryanHoch @LucaCesaretti It was terrible but if I get to hear it 60 or so more times it‚Äôll still make me happy
Sterlings home run call for Stanton is a huge NO for me dawg common u had all winter and that‚Äôs what u come up what does Stanton have to do with Italy anyway
Suits -Empire &amp; Star tonight pretty good TV welcome back Wed nights !!!

@JeffMYoung85 Heisman vs 2 trips to NFC championship game and prob bowl hhmmm think ya thinking is a bit off
Today‚Äôs question does Gelo Ball get drafted ? Please remember the NBA only has 2 rounds not 700 like baseball &amp; football !!!! Is he a top 60 player n the world  ????
KAP is much better more accomplished  Manziel is the definition of white privilege &amp; that‚Äôs not to say he doesn‚Äôt deserve another chance Ima a fan I love Johnny football buuuuut   if he gets a job before KAP that‚Äôs crazy
@JonathanMayo hearing Acuna turned down 30 million but didn‚Äôt specify years and my questions is why wouldn‚Äôt he take that deal and buy out early years and still be able to killem w/free-agency
Not even mad at this I expected it with one exception the ridiculous black womam looking dumb as hell in this interview absolute token idiot https://t.co/IE5hPvCoRL
@MissRaquel4X üòç
@JonathanMayo  looking at fanagraph who the hell is Ezikiel Duran is he on the breakout player watch someone I need to familiarize myself with 14th prospect n the org or e they losing it ??

Wonder if bird played this spring with injury &amp; made it worse trying to prove a point either way if he‚Äôs üíØ  pct healthy 6-8 weeks isn‚Äôt end of the world -def beats alternative &amp; he can still hit 25 bombs coming back n mid 2 late May
U should never worrry about complimenting someone but the problem it that person will use that compliment and it‚Äôs context against u later to suit the agenda - attention whoring at its finest
@bsmeazy Im thinking Rutgers after Wenzel or the hall after Pj

Classic moment we miss u Luther https://t.co/SHUUkwix86
@EliteSportsNY German could be a 3-4 starter if given chance
@bsmeazy German is a competent if not over qualified 6th starter we don‚Äôt need a 6th starter didn‚Äôt wanna spend the money - German - Cessa - Sheffield by July - Adams by July Abreau next season - Tate soon after we ok
If mofos spent the time working on the actual craft instead of spending time promoting bullshit they would actually be able to b what the say they r !!!! A few pics don‚Äôt make u a model nor does a studio session make u an artist
Glad the Yankees look like they r valuing the contributions of Domingo German I‚Äôve said he‚Äôs gonna be good - I‚Äôd prefer he go to Scranton &amp; stay stretched out biding time waiting for his shot @ the  start let Cessa have that 13th spot &amp; become a  permanent reliever
@TVbytheNumbers y‚Äôall really hate Monday nights never have cable ratings for Monday night is this a conspiracy
I‚Äôm Thinking I better win something big üèÜ üéñ https://t.co/afoonfwsd9

1 week 1 day my Yankee fans let‚Äôs go Bombers !!!!!!
@Yankees Absolutely one of the worse commercials ever so bad it‚Äôs actually good - we bring the heeeeaaaaat
Yankees should be much better this 1st Half remember last season Didi missed month - Sanchize missed month - no Robertson - no Kahnle - bad ü¶Ö then injured ü¶Ö - no Stanton now over a film season it equals out Castro went down second half - Hicks and Judge was hurt

@ByJasonFoster He went he‚Äôs wack didn‚Äôt steal shit Correa - Beltran stole show  said hell with president
@verosoze Yankees right about  üíØ
Kinda disappointed more Astros didn‚Äôt decline the whitehouse visit so many Latin Americans &amp; really no excuse to be there with a man who shits on u publicly and with actions just my opinion I‚Äôm entitled Correa &amp; Beltran I c u !!!!
@AndrewMarchand  so lemme get this straight correct me if I‚Äôm wrong the twins giving up draft pick ,intl bonus money &amp; 12 milli for 1 year of Lynn
On another note ‚Äú Scandal ‚Äú is getting good very very good last season thus far !!!!!!
These baseball free agents r getting fucked severely fucked with no vaseline wooooow only football guys get it worse nothing guaranteed but signing bonus !!!!
Congrats thisbis gonna be good https://t.co/qMfo8sQOd4
@JGraie Wooow yes
@JGraie Where when was this
I concur my friend but I need 4 https://t.co/1jYK5Ybz0Z
@JonHeyman Woooow he‚Äôs worth bout 40xs that
@bsmeazy German ready now  Acevedo &amp; Sheffield will b by July and if Lynn or Cobb or even Arietta stay u signed past the point u don‚Äôt have to give up anything but money then go for it
@bsmeazy Def not Lynn not with giving up draft pick and into money German will b just fine he‚Äôs better then Montgomery now
Yankee opening day lineup  Lf Gardy  RF Judge  1b Bird  DH Stanton  C Sanchize  Ss Didi  CF Hicks  3b should b andujar but it‚Äôll prob b Drury  2b Wade but soon Torres    Severino  Tanaka  Gray  CC  Montgomery
I‚Äôm telling y‚Äôall German is gonna beat out Cessa for the 6th starter and then coming for Montgomery as season progresses save this tweet Yankee Baseball
@keithlaw when olivares signs with Texas today where will he rank in ya top üíØ
@JonathanMayo when Olivares signs with a Texas today where will he fall in ya top üíØ prospect list
Don‚Äôt mess with Stanton let him rock n right keep it simple he‚Äôs here to mash not for confusion let judge move over in a pinch stanton judge rotate right &amp; dh Gardner judge rotate lf and that‚Äôs that
Be u be unapologetic for being u - can‚Äôt be anyone else they‚Äôre taken !!!!
@MariahLynBoss Killem quietly !!!
@AndrewMarchand Can‚Äôt deny Alex and his knowledge of the game definitely could would be an amazing coach scout or anything else
McKinney - Austin - Drury - Andujar 2  homer - Florial a triple scored on sac fly exciting times n Tampa man Florial is exciting German getting that 6th pitcher spit killing Cessa this summer - Shreveport lucky no more options of German would b long man
@MLBPipeline @Yankees Make that 2 today
2 2day
Andujar is putting on a show another homerun that makes 4 this spring Drury who shoulda kept the prospects we have the third baseman
@iamshayness Good thing I get lots of money not to give a fuck what u think ü§î wipes forehead
@bsmeazy Florial prob starts season n high A or at most Double A would have to kill double A before AAA cuz then he‚Äôs knocking on mlb door gotta Get pitch recognition down - andujar is a üíé I tried to tell ya -
So far spring training  takes   Florial is a very exciting player - Andujar looks like the real deal will be the 3rd basemen very soon if Not 2 start - wade looks good - Sanchez is a beast - Judge looks healthy - Stanton is n cruise control no pitcher has impressed
Social media lit   ‚úÖ  Final ep Ratings high  ‚úÖ  Reunion anticipation ‚úÖ  DVR recordings high ‚úÖ  Check cleared ‚úÖ   Season 9 coming ‚úÖ  Y‚Äôall will get over it ‚úÖ
@YESNetwork @AndrewMarchand So carry all the games now or at least all the ones MLB network isn‚Äôt airing I‚Äôm sure they wanna get in on the NY baseball fun
Confused how u can throw someone under the bus when it‚Äôs been the story line for the last 3 weeks - they been talking about her  showing dude the box on national tv since the trip how wasn‚Äôt that common knowledge at this point
@youlovesantana_ Don‚Äôt know u to feel a type of way but I believe n shooting ya shot don‚Äôt talk bout it be about it
@BryanHoch No issues w/ stretching him out and going back to bullpen stretched out
Yankees will regret Zach littell for Jaimie garcia real soon
@AndrewMarchand A rod hate is useless maybe get a life and get over it - trump is president Alex can manage
@the_truth_uncut Deny deny deny and look stupid stupid stupid have I not watched the three episodes previous get yaself together then @ me when u make some sense fuck u telling something that‚Äôs been on tv 3 weeks In A row
@IamGabiVictor Bla bla bla
@MLBNetwork @Yankees I tried and y‚Äôall cut the damn game off and put on top 1st basemen for the 50th time
@JackCurryYES did they really just cut the yankee game off mlb network the  bottom of the first inning - why would they black it out even though yes isn‚Äôt showing it how retarded
@BaseballAmerica Facts
@BleacherReport No what‚Äôs childish is he tried to hurt Russ lastnight  nobody is stupid watch the replay it‚Äôs obvious
@BryanHoch Draft pics &amp; international money why would they
@youlovesantana_ So stop playing and change that !!!
@bsmeazy Wanna c Drury play stil dont think he‚Äôs long term better then Miguel - he‚Äôs gonna mash 20- 80 type mash
@WorldWideTy2332 Frank good on D gives nothing on O Mudiae ok on D not much on O Burke is a potential 15 -6 type player in this uptempo system while also playing pressure D
2 quick points   1 why r the knicks trying to win   2 Trey Burke is the best Knick Pg
@Fyocca123 Gleyber is locked n @ 2nd regardless of machado who wants to play SS moving forward maybe Didi goes to 3rd arod style
Would‚Äôve liked to c Andujar get the gig at third don‚Äôt really know Drury but a 25 yr old competing doesn‚Äôt sound like a stop gap - sucks a lil bit
@JackCurryYES Another bat with a lil power and high K rate smh and his D at 3rd isn‚Äôt that good either don‚Äôt get this unless he‚Äôs gonna be super utility by July
@Friziao81 Very possible but I‚Äôm thinking super utility starts season at 2nd while torres Get that time back then once he‚Äôs up I c a 2nd 3 rd rotation unless andujar stinks it up this spring then all bets off
Special election n KY went to the Dems kinda crazy considering Trump killed Hillary n that region - hopefully changing of guard not long before Dems control house and next year senate we hope
Lmao just peeped someone saying don‚Äôt judge chyna for giving bad neck on video cuz maybe she didn‚Äôt like him - so my question is this women u give head 2 dudes u don‚Äôt like I think shorty called it courtesy head - please advise asking for a friend
@lasa_g_na @1KingGohan Lol no shame in ya game ‚Äú courtesy head ‚Äú
@JonathanMayo is Pablo Julio Martinez a top üíØ player - see he is allowed to sign can catch end of this signing period with Tx or wait til July for Yankees !!
@Buster_ESPN So u just refuse to let Andujar be great I c - fucking hater
@Friziao81 BRring something catastrophic we should b playing for it - houston - clev - boston only comp
@Friziao81 Andujar goes 280 with 20-23 homers 25 doubles no walks &amp; decent D / Tores goes 280 with 12-15 homers nice 350 OBP and solid D both will Get rookie of year votes
@Friziao81 Now the arm is already here German will surprise people as will Acevedo &amp; Adams with Sheffield ready by July / August save the money yanks r good
@Friziao81 Kids have no pressure none at all they r both top üíØ players one is top 10 and certified star written on him most teams would kill 2 Get him playing time we really trying to find reasons not to Didi range will help Miguel &amp; if u can‚Äôt turn double plays with him go home
@Friziao81 Any other team u have the 6 &amp; 55 or whatever prospect u break ya next to get him n the league look at recent teams but not the Yankees u don‚Äôt need all stars at every position 2 win Didi - Sanchez - Judge - Stanton all top üíØ players Bird - Gardy - Hicks all solid if not now when
@Friziao81 He‚Äôs super  athletic with pt &amp; confidence let‚Äôs c he might b another 280 350 25 HR 20 Sb guy he‚Äôs only 28 in his prime so time is now - just still believe Ells has a lot left
@JonathanMayo Lol u got me
@Friziao81 I‚Äôm waiting to c Hicks do it for a full season I like Hicks a lot but a full season please and Ellsbury is ahead of Frazier on depth chart Frazier h less he has a great spring training will prob start n Scranton
@CNN Can Democratic Party grab that seat like the rest of them or is this one set n stone republican
Never lose either win or learn !!
@JonathanMayo Was a question n a statement form trying to sneak and c if u said yes cuz that would mean they were n the top 4 systems !!!
@youlovesantana_ Be a real one @ her and post the video !!!
@JonathanMayo so I gotta wait til March 2/3 to see ya Yankees  top 30 list
People are really sleeping on Ellsbury just goes to show once the narrative is created nothing u can do - he isn‚Äôt a bad player just hasn‚Äôt lived up 2 price tag but def still a quality player when healthy 270 - 13-18 homers 350 obp &amp; 25 SBs
First day of camp for everyone in the big complex - I‚Äôm ready !!!! https://t.co/9obSHhl0De
How many of u when sifting thru social media say why am I following this person &amp; how did I even get here at all but don‚Äôt unfollow because they may notice ur gone
@Trapineze Like I said the president has awaken the sleeping racist they are out they r proud and they r comfortable - I think they have shown the comfort level since dude has been elected
Actually more respect 4 people that express how they feel publicly &amp; in n ya face - let‚Äôs not pretend &amp;  go home upset u were even n my presence - ok my diatribe is done all star Saturday all we do is play sports &amp; entertain let me basque n the glory
Shut *
People think just like her &amp; those r the people that r living n the glory of ya president - be very clear they exhist &amp; not just n Mississippi or Arkansas they live next door to u
Not saying it‚Äôs right just saying open ya eyes wake up and realize the world isn‚Äôt sweet &amp; roses lots of hatred lots of bigotry lots of prejudice &amp; that won‚Äôt change so pretending it has or we have overcome is just silly on your part
2days debate why is everyone so mad  bout ‚Äú shit up &amp; dribble ‚Äú if u think these things aren‚Äôt said everyday behind closed doors or with people with like thoughts ur crazy - difference is YOUR POTUS has mad it OK 2 express racism prejudice hate publicly its gets the base riled up

@IamShaneMorris @redlabourer Well done well played thank u for keeping it üíØ cuz u didn‚Äôt have to
@pinstripealley Obviously they new the price tag and didn‚Äôt want him obvious they want Andujar to get a shot
@kporzee get well soon homie bigger better faster stronger next season !!!!!

@MLBPipeline @MLB @jorgemateord @Athletics @JaneMLB Yankees will regret that Sonny Gray trade
@BryanHoch @LuisSeverino94 @45PedroMartinez That changeup gonna be a work of art !!!!
@BryanHoch Domingo German becomes the man this year a solid 3-4 better then Monty &amp; CC 10-5 with a 3.4 era
@BryanHoch @Yankees @MAndujarPapa Hope so means spring training went swimmingly
@bsmeazy @JackCurryYES 275-280 18-22 homers and will bat at bottom so more runs then rbis
@MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport Fucking hilarious u n the zone tonight
@BDubb2k12 Facts
@Jackiebel12 151 intelligence quotient prob separates me from u by about 95 percentile but with that said narrative remains the same
Fanagraph makes a lil more sense   12 Torres outside top 5 a lil low   14 Andujar a lil high but I like it    39 Sheffield will be higher at seasons end   59 Abreau good placement for him   79 Florial will be  much higher once he gets the swing &amp; miss together
@JonathanMayo Yup fanagraph has him for sure 14 kinda high but I insist he has a 280 - 25 homer bat and will play a serviceable 3rd - ops wont ever jump out cuz he on base comes only from hits no walks at all that‚Äôll need to change
So baseball prospectus has come out with the top 101 &amp; ridiculously left Miguel Andujar off it Torres 3  - Florial 26 - Adams 51 - Sheffield 57  - Abreau 100 @JonathanMayo please speak to ya counterparts that‚Äôs a ridiculous omission
@jeffpaternostro @cdgoldstein @jaseidler Lol list lost a lot of respect if u don‚Äôt think Miguel Andujar is a top üíØ prospect just off the bat alone not To mention he isn‚Äôt a hack at third he‚Äôll actually be average over there
Out of the 53 players on the Philadelphia ü¶Ö roster how many will decline the invite 2 the Dog House - I‚Äôm betting on a solid half
@MichaelRapaport Well this escalated quickly
Now that the Patriots lost Trump is like damn another team I will have to invite then uninvite after they decline !!!!
Congrats Eagles ü¶Ö well played !!!
@noemadnyc Def not bout to score now &amp; I still got them
@HeemieAhmeen Patriots as of now
The eagles will not b this years falcons
Even the Patriot come out music is Republican !!!
@Brandons51515 @HotStoveStats @asdnyy Only time you will ever win def not in wins losses soak it up
@TigersJUK @chrismott21 @HotStoveStats This countdown is based on one year shredder picks top 10 from season past
@demariojackson_ @Ivdown12 @HotStoveStats German is better then Montgomery hands down
@Ivdown12 @demariojackson_ @HotStoveStats G that‚Äôs N understatement if u can‚Äôt c that ur Stevie wonder
@HotStoveStats Severino had a better year verlander lost ya list credibility
All u ladies Don‚Äôt peek speak !!!

The funny thing about social media is motherfuckas hating the most r the ones if You walked n a room would ask for a pic , post &amp; front like y‚Äôall best friends - the girls that talk with disdain yet the 1st ones asking what Hotel u @ I get it no offense taken
@IamGabiVictor Get focused
@MLBPipeline @MLB @JonathanMayo @11WillieCalhoun @brent_honeywell @_JorgeAlfaro11 @TorresGleyber @LewisBrinson @jp_crawford @MaxFried32 @willya02 Stars will align and you guys will obviously be surprised that Miguel Andujar will absolutely be n the top 3 save this tweet
@BIANCAisKING U aight
@Jcfletcher721 @JackCurryYES Over Shreve def think he can do that
Gonna sound crazy 2 some of u Yankees fans but given the opportunity I think German can beat out Montgomery for he 5th rotation spot &amp; wind up a solid 3 n near near future - trade wouldn lt look so bad after all @JackCurryYES
Trump literally lives n his own world last nights SOTU was not the most watched n history based on ratings maybe if u break down demo such  as Neonazis white  supremacist wtf etc but not overall - wasn‚Äôt even more watched then Obamas
@MLBPipeline Damn no Acevedo - Medina - Perez or Solak common now u gotta be kidding
@Aminabuddafly I‚Äôm n let‚Äôs do it
Most don‚Äôt believe n u they just stick around just n case - beware of the Half foot n half foot out syndrome
Women complain about dudes all day on social &amp; vice versa cuz they think they‚Äôre connecting with the gender base  but really the connection should be I got rid of him\ her found a new guy/ girl &amp;  we‚Äôre happy - giving so much energy is tainting the new energy IJS
@CNN Hilarious who did we help win not like they have a real democracy where people vote and lefties officials campaign
@ringer @S_C_ Shot chart def off Rocawear won big n it‚Äôs time sold for Over 200 million Samsung deal pcoeketed him 15-20 Mill if I can make 220 in my kisses sign me up
@Bigbdog75 Exactly but no defending trump he‚Äôs dividing the country and it‚Äôs by design
@bsmeazy And I‚Äôve been saying for some time now Andujar isn‚Äôt a butcher at 3rd cannon arm good range just inconsistent but the bat plays expect 280 and 25 bombs is he plays every day won‚Äôt need to spend on Machado who wants to play SS anyway
@bsmeazy Def not signing a veteran to replace Gardy if they don‚Äôt pick up option &amp; Frazier is indeed gone then prob gonna move Judge 2 LF put Stanton N RF open up DH 4 Sanchize a lil more will still have Ells -Hicks - Stanton - Judge - McKinney if bank is broke 4 Bryce then all bets off
@bsmeazy Florial hits Double A this year &amp; will be ready at some point n 19 def not 2-3 years away was promoted 2 double A for the playoffs last season - prob starts there this season
@JonathanMayo What yankee prospects with strong seasons can appear on this list guys on the radar ??
@Bigbdog75 I disagree but whatever we all grown and have our opinions
@bsmeazy Hopefully not but I think so 2 Gardner gone next year jocks could falter need insurance with Florial right around the corner
If i cook food for the week &amp; leave u serve the food should u brag about how good u cook ?? I suppose u could if nobody knows I cooked but we all know Obama was the chef so stop taking credit for shit u didn‚Äôt do Donald not my president Gump
Clint Frazier got hosed only exceded the rookie eligibility by 4 @ bats has no role on team this year will prob start back n 3A &amp; woulda been top 30 prospect giving Yankees 7
all 5 major prospects traded away have made one list or another Mateo has rebounded on all lists Rutherford is free falling Guzman made 2 Fowler &amp; KAP have to get healthy but still made top üíØ lists
Yankee üíØ prospect 3 major rankings   (6 -5 -5 BA - Law -MILB )Gleyber  (38 - NR -44 -BA Law MILB) Florial (41-16 -48 BA - law milb) Sheffield  (59 - 54 -65 BA - Law milb)Andujar  (NR -73 -NR BA- Law milb ) Perez  (77-99 -74 - BA-Law-milb) Abreau  (81 - NR 75 BA - Law milb) Adams
@JonathanMayo were any of Guzman - Medina - Acevedo -Solak or Perez considered
MILB top üíØ with my previous predictions @JonathanMayo wooooow almost spot on   Adams - 75 predicted top 75  Abreau -74  predicted top 75  Andujar - 65  predicted top 50   Sheffield - 48 predicted top 50   Florial - 44 predicted top 35   Torres - 5 * predicted top 5
@susanslusser Have who back Mateo would never play n the OF as constructed 2nd is Torres 3rd Andujar SS Didi Fowler def blocked forever and KAP lets get a healthy season only thing maybe that package would get someone else
@Robfeliz I‚Äôm predicting both of them being rookie of the year candidates
@bsmeazy I anticipate he spending the whole year with big team torres starts in 3A so they can steal the year back
Indeed we do and no we won‚Äôt be
Strong 1st halves by Louis Medina - Frecier Perez -Domingo Acevedo - chance adams - Nick Solak means Yankees have 5 more unanimous top 100 guys with Perez already making Keith Laws ESPN list and coming in pretty high
Torres top 5   Florial top 35   Andujar top 50   Sheffield top 50   Abreau top 75   Adams top 75   Solak - Acevedo - Medina - Perez - Just outside üíØ   My prediction becomes reality tomorrow  night @ 8 @JonathanMayo
So Law has Florial &amp; Acevedo just outside the üíØ  Baseball America had Louis Medina just out the üíØ  Which means Torres - Florial - Sheffield - Andujar- Abreau - Adams - Perez - Acevedo - Medina are all üíØ type players with Frazier just graduating    Things look Up yankee nation
@BleacherReport @MarkelleF @JCameratoNBCS Now if he could only make shots from 20 and in
@BNightengale Bring back Starlin !!!!
Strong Mind body soul equals unbreakable spirit https://t.co/zVqeiPNWDQ
No Florial n top 10 OF hmmm I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs just outside @JonathanMayo
2 killed 19 injured &amp; not a peep from dick head Donald I guess senseless white on white mass murders go quietly into the night - had shooter been black or brown it be a tweet shit storm
@bsmeazy Anyone is available n the right deal but they wouldn‚Äôt let him go for Cole that should tell u something about his status - and I think he can b rookie of the year his bat isn‚Äôt the question the glove is Yankees lineup he‚Äôll see great pitches short porch good power 280 - 25
@Ken_Rosenthal So I‚Äôm guessing Mariano Rivera get 100 pct of the votes
@Buster_ESPN Fuck that racist asshole
@nytimes Making a big deal about this under oath shit as if he doesn‚Äôt believe his lie and really cares not telling them under oath
@verosoze Yes indeed I‚Äôm ready
Pre preseason predictions - if given chance to play everyday   Torres - bats 285 - 15 - 18 homers OPS over 750 great D @ 2nd   Andujar - bats 280 25 homers OPS over 800 - decent D @ 3rd
@BleacherReport Al the above
@BleacherReport Melo is gonna be a beast but y‚Äôall talking bout these games like he playing Rubio &amp; Porzingis the level of comp is equivalent to 15 and under AAU
@MLBPipeline @mi_guardado @AJCassavell @gregorMLB @wwchastain I‚Äôll take Torres &amp; Acuna for the win
@yourfavoritenay That tongue eating ass licking balls and sucking sick all at the same damn time
@JonathanMayo let me know now if Florial isn‚Äôt in ya top 100 so I can officially take my dvr off record for Saturday night
@keithlaw really no Estevan Florial common Man ur kidding right ??
@MariahLynBoss Awwwwe my lil pink berry
How amazing am I ?? Lol
@JonathanMayo Looking forward I already have the DVR set to mlb channel I‚Äôm sure we r gonna have a lengthy debate bout some of these rankings
@keithlaw üëÄ wow can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow 50-1 should be interesting
@keithlaw Hmmmmm Keith I see 3 already I replaced my Acevedo with Frecier why so high on him &amp; low in Abreau - Torres- Sheffield - Andujar and Adams still out n the atmosphere so it‚Äôs looking like 7 after all
@JonathanMayo Meant baseball America
@JonathanMayo wondering if you guys are as down on Blake Rutherford as https://t.co/PvkbqxfBRq completely out I c Mateo rebounded woulda been interesting with him @ second Fowler is def blocked now
top 6 yankees in exact order I had them last time we spoke think they stole my list üòÇ far as Yankee trades Guzman top 50 by midseason for Stanton how can u complain  woulda been interesting with Mateo @ 2nd but  Fowler def now blocked
@jjcoop36 any Yankees just miss out on ya top 100 Solak - Acevedo Estrada - Perez
@BNightengale Hope u sing this tune when A Rod is eligible the best player ever
@BaseballAmerica's top 100 list 1 of many being released please refer to my previous tweet !!  #Yankees listed   SS Gleyber Torres (6),   OF Estevan Florial (38),   LHP Justus Sheffield (41),   3B Miguel Andujar (59),   RHP Albert Abreu (77),   RHP Chance Adams (81).
@Joelsherman1 Gonna miss Guzman I c Mateo shot back up no Blake Rutherford at all and Fowler still making noise regardless of injury but no Rutherford hmmmmm
@BettyBowers A,most as many people as the inauguration parade lol jokes
@baseballdad999 Hopefully he will be but won‚Äôt be popular enough off top to get the nod not even listed n top 10 first baseman
@youlovesantana_ Well stop playin games what u waiting on
This message is Creep squad approved !!!! https://t.co/Ev2IUEC3L2
@MichaelRapaport Facts say that shit again for the peanut gallery
Based on Sheer popularity Yankees  should have minimum 7 all stars   Sanchize C Judge RF / DH Stanton DH /RF Severino P  Didi SS *  Chapman - Betances - Robertson- Green pick 2 maybe all 4   Possible  Tanaka - Gardner - Hicks - kahnle
@baseballpro when does ya top 100 prospect list come out
@baseball_ref When does ya top 100 prospect list come out
@fangraphs when does your top 100 prospect list come out ??
@keithlaw when does your 100 list come out ??
@BenBadler Torres - Florial - Sheffield - Abreau - Adams - Andujar with Acevedo by midterm maybe Perez if he kills Tampa and heads to Trenton !!!!!
I‚Äôd  never eat detergent pods but can‚Äôt front they do look delicious !!!!
@youlovesantana_ Got u
@JonHeyman Fuck him he bleeches his skin he‚Äôs not even proud of who he is why should anyone else be

@ConstanceJones Amazing
U gotta b kidding me right this is the leader of the free world https://t.co/1S4UJdGHVp
@RenaB0416 Did u google it tell the truth
@MLBPipeline @Ry_McMahon @PavinSmith @n_pratto @Ewhite_19 @b_bradley_44 @Matt_Thaiss @_ronaldguzman @MLBDraft When u do ya second base will I c Gleyber Torres or is he still still considered a SS until the season starts when he will clearly be a 2nd baseman or will he be both which means Yankees have 2 second baseman with Solak
@bsmeazy Tatum went 3 weren‚Äôt getting him regardless Smith they should‚Äôve drafted Frazier is the true prize here tho
@BenBadler They gotta have a couple million left outta the 3.5 I know Salinas and Cabellos didn‚Äôt get 1.5 apiece
@TheLatifah Lol ya guy D
@KappaMan57 Definitely n Ga
Will the Cuban CF Julio Pablo Olivera b a top 100 player when he signs stateside ?? @keithlaw
@Yankeesfan290 @BenBadler Thinking between 8-12
@bsmeazy Lauri wouldn‚Äôt have excelled knocks have too many bigs as is and Dennis smith is gonna be good but Frazier is ridiculous already - smith still inconsistent Frazier borderline allstar
@giltoro22 Tatum &amp; the kid from the bulls I think they r happy with them pics maybe even the Lakers would do it again the same way
Screw everyone that was picked before 8 nothing u can do about that but the biggest mistake knicks made n Years was not picking Donavan Mitchell just another bad decision from the team the specializes n them
@_LoveOne2Manii No it doesn‚Äôt maybe u do push the unfollow button
I love joy just a lil bit https://t.co/o68cRSzx83
@JonathanMayo Ju@st realized last years #10rhp was the 34 prospect and although I love Albert that may be a lil aggressive for a preseason ranking from unranked into top 35 I. Thinking more like Top 75
@JonathanMayo @MLBNetwork How‚Äôs Abreau not on this list ??
@CNN Wouldn‚Äôt have hurt him his base woulda high fives him for bedding a woman they‚Äôve prob only masturbated 2
@Maurice420 Started to block u for putting that image on my page
@SiirBrock Yes indeed my brotha
@Complex Wow first he‚Äôs touching kids now he‚Äôs a racist so basically a racist pedophile
In the immortal words of that rap group expreeeees yaself y‚Äôall know the rest !!!! https://t.co/I53Gh8xfP2
@MLBPipeline @MLB Albert Abreau
Get mooooney !!! https://t.co/MF4irIv8FF
@KZUNCH Silly them
If u walk like a ü¶Ü quack like a ü¶Ü then why pretend to b anything else ??
@CNN If it walks like a ü¶Ü quacks like a ü¶Ü then what do we call it a racist
@JonathanMayo @jschrimsher2 @JonathanMayo happy belated birthday !!!
@UberFacts And put it all together n the 40s
@DaveMayberry335 @YESNetwork McKinney should be top 20 if he played well this year could rise m mid season rankings
@youloveSannxo That‚Äôs code for dude just fucked and dipped off
@MLBPipeline @MLB @jimcallisMLB @Nationals @Phillies @jp_crawford @Mariners @tigers @Mets @Braves @Reds @Leodytaveras How does Estevan Florial draw Andru Jones comparisons and not be here when Dru was one of the best defensive CF ever
@darenw Point being what I‚Äôm watching 103 get turned around these days 96 isn‚Äôt what it used to be so stop harping on velo it‚Äôs def not aboutbthat anymore
@TaylorHing Taaaaaaaayyyyyloooooooorrrrrrrr
@AmbitiousDt Exactly u made my point don‚Äôt bring others into your mix if u still wanna fight for the last one
@HERSHEYKISS97 I agree then work on fixing that that‚Äôs my whole point
@BryanHoch @MLB Yankees r fine with the 5 if Montgomery falters we have German who I think is very underrated def can be as good or better also Adams / Acevedo n wings along with Cessa ! warren - green long / spot men with Sheffield ready by July Abreau by next July
If ya relationship is over let it b over why talk bout shit from months ago - what dude or female u know wants someone still talking bout the last person wether negatively or positive if ur done b done but seriously nobody cares to hear u obsess over some old shit
@MLBNetwork if Didi isn‚Äôt a top ten SS I‚Äôve totally lost respect for the network &amp; these list won‚Äôt be paying much attention going forward
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal My hate comes as a byproduct of taking the Astros offer and not the Yankee offer lol
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal Ima yankee fan
@Ken_Rosenthal Inclined to believe Cole isn‚Äôt that good &amp; yankees package isn‚Äôt what was once thought &amp; everyone knows something we as fans don‚Äôt cuz otherwise Pittsburgh got hosed
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal Yup c u n game 7 for the pennant
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal We shall c still would‚Äôve taken Estrada - warren - Cave from yankees over that package
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal 15 homers doesn‚Äôt profile n corners thus why he must improve routes to become legit cf or he isn‚Äôt a regular
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal Martin's hitting ability stands out more than his pop, as he works counts while using a compact left-handed swing to hit line drives to all fields. He does have at least average raw power and is starting to turn on more pitches, so he could become a 15-homer threat in the bigs
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal No arm takes bAd routes in center doesn‚Äôt hit w/ power to profile n corners as a regular but had good speed slap hitter too all fields decent player - doesn‚Äôt sound like a 5 tool guy to me
@theperfecttim @Ken_Rosenthal That didn‚Äôt get picked in rule 5 draft uh huh try again
@jjcoop36 So essentially Adam warren - Lou Cessa - Thairo Estrada - jake Cave or billy McKinney for that matter
@JonathanMayo so was that Astro pirate deal essentially Adam warren - jake Cave - Thairo Estrada &amp; louis Cessa got Cole
@AndrewMarchand the kids the Astros gave up would been equivalent to whom in Yankee organization
@BNightengale Get under the tax sign Didi  4 - 50 next season
@TalkinRangers @vincelara @Joelsherman1 Closer to 20 but who cares at this point  Let the kids play and c what we have the lineup doesn‚Äôt need help nobody has 9 280 - 25 homer guys &amp; 7 15 win pitchers it‚Äôs relative we should bash other teams 4-5 starter a guy with a 4 era prob wins 15 games here n ny
Rise and shine use the day to make yaself great again !!!!
@ABCPolitics What‚Äôs really disgusting is black people smiling n his face cuz he read a few a cards - just goes to show no matter who u r or what u stand for they will smile n ya face regardless - sorta like the Internet bash u behind ya back but let u show up it‚Äôs pics &amp; smiles 4 everyone
@HillaryClinton Fat ugly sloppy with a bad comb over
@realOconnor614 @JonathanMayo Yeah never been high on him Sheffield could be a 2-3 Abreau could be 2 Andujar is for me 280 with 25 bombs
WSJ reports that Trump's Lawyer Michael Cohen paid Porn Star Stormy Daniels $130K to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she had with Donald Trump. Y‚Äôall president out here trying to be n the creep squad
@jimcallisMLB team top 30 comes first then the top üíØ am I crazy orbdonwe see these Yankees in the list - torres - florial - Sheffield - Adams -Abreau - Andujar by midseason Acevedo
@JonathanMayo yankees top 10  1 Torres  2 Florial  3 Sheffield  4 Andujar  5 Abreau  6 Adams  7 Acevedo  8 Estrada  9 Perez  10 Solak    Andujar maybe shouldn‚Äôt be that high until D is proven but damn that  bat plays
@mizzyton Facts indeed
Blatantly vile racist comment over &amp; over again but yet they still ride For &amp; defend Just goes to show u no matter what it is if they wanna go justify his actions they will even when they can‚Äôt !! Shit hole President
Damn Donald every day it‚Äôs something new we can‚Äôt even stay focused on your last racist comment / action was because u h keepem coming so frequently
@jimcallisMLB did the Yankees just add more intl national money with the sonny gray trade - heard they chose intl money over the player to b named later option a is that new or was it part of the 3.5

@JonHeyman Would be very silly for yankees to give up the farm unless he agrees to an extension and they can trade Ellsbury - 1 he might not like NY and bout 2 would wasteall the work getting under 197 3 nothing is guaranteed in this world not even having Machado
@JoeBudden Hold up r u saying KAT isn‚Äôt better ??

@CNN Damn we could walk across the Hudson and not have to pay tolls or wait n traffic
In 3 hours it‚Äôll be founders day what u NUPES doing out there !!!!!!!
@TheRealDarius33 @JackCurryYES And I‚Äôm very high on Miguel‚Äôs bat 280 - 25-25 is rookie of the year status if he can just play a serviceable third base which I think he can be not just serviceable but solid
@TheRealDarius33 @JackCurryYES Don‚Äôt want Cole he hasn‚Äôt pitched well but the 1 season been just about leaugue average or below the other seasons don‚Äôt wanna give up the farm for him - we have 5 starters give German - Adams a shot and wait for Sheffield , Acevedo and Abreau to b ready we will b fine
@Ken_Rosenthal @McCulloughTimes So will the hot stove ever be lit cuz this news is old cold pizza üçï
Pre spring prediction if Yankees give kids a shot - Andujar hits 280 - 25 homers 25 doubles Torres wins rookie of the year &amp; German pitches to a 3.5 era with 13 wins he‚Äôs better then Montgomery @JackCurryYES

So sick of motherfukas talking bout the bag the bag people with a bag don‚Äôt need to discuss a bag only people who should know bout ya bag is u and Uncle Sam
@jimcallisMLB is Blake Rutherford still a top 80 prospect I know his stock has fallen with 2 subpar seasons just tryin to c if he still has star written on him or was he overrated and the Yankees sold high
@SeyMoreeeee @Joelsherman1 2 n half a year a full year of Gary woulda beat fullmer for rookie of year
@JonHeyman Closer money will rise every year so What the Yankees paid it first next few seasons Miller will get that kinda money it‚Äôll be the norm for bit time closers period not a bad contracts get over yaselves haters - and luxury tax is also rising so spare me
So the new thing going into 18 is 2 post booty model pics but say in ya bio med school so u get the beauty &amp; brains DMs Jig is up not fooling me

Merry Christmas üéÅüéÑ enjoy ya day
@Aaronjh1019 He has gray esque stats and peripherals so the deal should look like that 2 severely injured and one with stick down but all have a lot of potential I do Frazier - adams and maybe koermer
@baseballdad999 No Florial - Sheffield - Andujar - Abreau - torres -  Estrada anyone else im cool
@CBlaisure What‚Äôs ya point did c that u made one
@HappyGilmore696 @sMaKDiddYbang Neither is 1 good one so rethink that position especially when Pittsburgh has the pitching whisperer Cole has been good once not CC who we thought was over not Tanaka 1 bad 1 over over his career and not Severino who was our basic point none of them cost us prospects
@sMaKDiddYbang U made my point why we giving up the. Farm for someone who hasn‚Äôt been good n going on 3 seasons - we don‚Äôt give up the farm n hopes he‚Äôs good again one day what kinda thought process is that
@Drawzilla U clearly aren‚Äôt a yankee fanatic if u think Gleyber coming up a full season of Gray a healthy Sanchez and Didi and Hicks and of course Stanton aren‚Äôt changes
Flirting is sexual harassment just depends on if she likes u a lil bit
‚ÄúYou all just got a lot richer,‚Äù Trump said to friends during dinner at Mar-a-Lago Friday night. He was talking about his tax scam he had just signed into law. What a shady grifter &amp; pathological liar.  Wonder who voted for this guy &amp; why ??
@GangstaBooQOM hometeam let‚Äôs do some music !!!!!!
@DonCheadle bring back Marty Khan !!!! My favorite show Tv just isn‚Äôt the same without it !!!!!
@jimcallisMLB r either of the new Yankees gonna appear in the top 30  ??
@keithlaw U don‚Äôt have to answer I guess I‚Äôm a prophet !!!!
@LindsayMontell And I would or should care that ur no longer one ???
Next President has the easiest job n the world just undo what Trump has done and it‚Äôll be pretty easy considering Dems should have control of everything after there midterm elections - I think I might run solidify my legacy
@AndrewMarchand I like both Sheffield &amp; Abreau more then adams &amp; Monty but I‚Äôm sure the package isn‚Äôt gonna be Montgomery &amp; Adams for Cole thus having to give up Frazier  &amp; Andujar that is the mistake
@keithlaw what r the Yankees waiting on with this international bonus pool  $ why haven‚Äôt they signed Ronny Rojas weren‚Äôt they waiting for him to turn 16 &amp; have been forever linked to Salinas &amp; Cabello what‚Äôs the hold up with those 3
Yanks don‚Äôt need Garett Cole have 5 pitchers with enough minor league depth can‚Äôt have nor should want everybody - we built the farm let‚Äôs not start doing silly things cuz Cash wants new shiny toys -say no to Cole @AndrewMarchand
Rise shine be grateful for family &amp; friends during this holiday break
@CNN What American people idiot u don‚Äôt nor have u ever spoken for the general population - the people u speak for live in your bubble
@RealSkipBayless @undisputed Skip says the dumbest shit I don‚Äôt what motivates him 2 say such ridiculous shit
@ConstanceJones I love u
Goooooood morning everybooooooooody

Virginia Democrats just ended GOP control of the State House after winning a seat, 11,608 to 11,607, in a recount &amp; they say every vote doesn‚Äôt count !!!!!!
@RealSkipBayless Bro does the dumb shit I say I‚Äôm social help ya ratings I just can‚Äôt understand why u say the shit u say
@Robbieblueeyez @JackCurryYES More like 120 - 125 but agreed that def gives some offensive leeway at third
@mikesilva53089 @JackCurryYES No hell no
@djheat42 @_SulimanB @JackCurryYES Cano wanted out nothing to do with money felt the Yankees treated Latin American players funny style
@JLmierz25 @JackCurryYES U make no sense a top 4 pitching staff arguably the best bullpen n baseball and a top 2 offense what more foundation do U need
@JLmierz25 @JackCurryYES Definitely not  hi 80s low 90s ur basically saying they r  the same team as last year &amp; that sounds nuts Stanton - kahnle - Robertson  - Gray -  bird Didi &amp; Sanchize all misssed a month with injury def a 95-100
If Yankees plan to go after Manny next season wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to give Andujar the keys this season  ?? see what u have what if he goes 280 with 25 homers then ucan get a lot for him in a trade or why even spend on Manny !!! @JackCurryYES
The power went out here n the ATL 4 hours, affecting  tens of thousands of people, leaving them stranded in the dark.   The power has been out n Puerto Rico 4 months, affecting millions of people, leaving them stranded in the dark. Many still have no lights. Reflect on that.üáµüá∑
Hollidays r upon us but u should value those close 2 u everyday family &amp; friends !!!
@colbycolb As well it should
Life is short work hard play harder and remember u can‚Äôt take any of it with you !!!!!!
@TheLatifah Cardiac arrest
Rip Woodsie !!!
@jimcallisMLB if denbo finally got Devers &amp; Guzman I wonder what prospects he asked for first
@JonHeyman Yankees trying to acquire another young controlled pitcher when they don‚Äôt need one German is a diamond n the rough with Sheffield &amp; Abreau right around the corner just b patient
@BNightengale Don‚Äôt need him save the money give some of these kids a shot and let‚Äôs c what we have
Welcome back CC   C - Sanchez  1b - bird  2b - wade  3b - andujar  SS - didi  LF - Gardy  CF - Hicks  RF - Judge  DH - Stanton   Severino  Tanaka  Gray  CC  Montgomery - Adams - German -Acevedo   Warren  Green  Kahnle  Robertson  Betances  Chapman
@Topsheff42 Congrats homie c u n the bigs !!!!
Working on a huge deal with Modern Luxury Magazine gonna be a big deal stay tuned !!!!
@YankeesGirl2113 Facts
@JackCurryYES just watched u on hot stove do they really think Wade is gonna be good what‚Äôs his ceiling - I‚Äôve yet to be impressed with him but I love Andujar don‚Äôt think he gets his props
We know he won‚Äôt but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if Trump resigned !!!!!
@Ming67521037 Dunno know bout Alabama being ‚Äú the south ‚Äú definitely in the south doesn‚Äôt set trends tho but u all should definitely be applauded for keeping Moore out of office that was a big deal
@vannity4 Facts scary times
Sexual harassment flood gates have been open for a minute not but this is getting a bit ridiculous I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been rampant for some time but damn I‚Äôm willing to bet him saying ‚Äú hey sweety ‚Äú didn‚Äôt cause u emotional distress
Last thing on Moore  since he lost anyway I would be remiss 2 not mention that The President of the United States openly endorsed &amp; campaigned for a racist bigot pedophile !!!! Just saying u elected this guy
@jimcallisMLB Looking for 6 yankees Torres - Florial - Sheffield - Abreau - Adams - Andujar
Thank u Alabama
@MichaelRapaport Preach mike
@AndrewMarchand I def think he‚Äôs plug and play at this point I could play third
@BryanHoch Will be very disappointed if the Yankees don‚Äôt let some of these kids play Andujar &amp; Torres need a shot no stupid trades they‚Äôve done enough resign CC and keep some of the youngsters Adams - torres Andujar- Sheffield - Abreau why waste money now the kids r about ready
@JabariBlash @BryanHoch Naw homie prob Scranton but you‚Äôll be fine
@BryanHoch Save money get some pitchers and let the kids play Frazier coming back is a bad move coulda kept Headley
Lotta things being said about Keaton I don‚Äôt advocate violence &amp; he shouldn‚Äôt b paying 4 his disgusting mothers actions with that said if true 60k for a sob story from a kid throwing around racial slurs wasn‚Äôt the answer either !!!! Case closed the end
@hitmann49 @Joelsherman1 Austin - Romine kids n 3A
@BryanHoch @MLBPipeline FYI Andujar would hit 275-280 with 20 homers n the league right now just an FYI
@jjcoop36 Indeed torres- Florial - Sheffield - adams -Abreau - Andujar !!!!! Don‚Äôt trade anyone they have a few bucks get the pitcher u covet an let‚Äôs the kids play Andujar is ready as is torres after clock is setback
@colbycolb hear it‚Äôs ya birthday happy birthday homie
Im a lil thottish n my ways gotta change that early New Years resolution
@michcusejoe5 @BrendanKutyNJ And at this point still under the cap so what‚Äôs ya hater induced point
@BIANCAisKING Dumb AF
@luckylady_0 U was there I imagine FOH he said dat shit
@Toyj22 Deep
@justinawithaG So she personally got the money what‚Äôs ya point
@I_m_Tania Actually I did let‚Äôs c if the go fund me pays for her funeral shits crazy
@RainStarzBryant So 60k for the ignorant that was smart thing of u to say
kid Keaton uses racial slurs towards other kids gets his ass beat gets money visits from all kinds of celebs / athletes etc etc -welcome 2 the Internet where research isnt done funny part is I saw black people reaching out visiting him smiling with him meanwhile ur a nigger 2 him
@dbrust1030 @drocktrot @VelVelHoller @bullyray5150 So I guess u didn‚Äôt know the reason he got his ass beat was because he was calling kids outta name racially slurred - naw fuck him another F/ bomb for ya and his mom
@JonathanMayo Ageeed for Stanton all is fair n love &amp; victories looking forward this oughta be fun expect inordinate amounts tweets this season
Kid is beat up sits n car with Mom &amp; she films his heartfelt message creates go fund me for what I dunno hustles 60k - come to find out kid was beat up 4  using racial slurs moms a Neo nazi &amp; racist  - yup sounds about right the internet hustle is amazing
@BNightengale Judge being the better fielder &amp; LF have more ground in Yankee stadium wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to move Judge if anyone was 2 go
@dbrust1030 @drocktrot @VelVelHoller @bullyray5150 That has a racist bullying mother fuck this video why u even repost it
@Gladiator_BBall U act like the pitching was bad it wasn‚Äôt ever all season solid as a whole and only one spot n rotation can very well give that to a kid like chance adams - Domingo German - might wanna check them stats rotation was top 5
One thing bout the Internet it‚Äôll give u the attention u desire just know as that comes u will then get the attention u didn‚Äôt - no hiding shit once u pop -people have time today
@JonathanMayo hated 2 lose Guzman think he absolutely has ace potential woulda shot thru the system and been top 100 bybyears end expect to c him ranked there shortly but that Said Devers will also be good but middle infield depth and young kids already n league he‚Äôs blocked
@JonHeyman I agree with tha marlins on this one as much as I‚Äôd like Guzman to be mediocre he‚Äôs actually pretty damn good and secondary stuff jumped  like hell last year expect him to jump into top 100 this year sits 98 tips out at 103 with improving secondary stuff
Wake up be amazing go 2 sleep wake up do it again !!!!!
@TMZ @HollywoodLife And these women r the gifts that keep on giving
Like this tweet save this tweet   Judge 40  Stanton 40 Sanchize 35  Bird 30  Didi 28  Andujar 15-20 ******  Gardy 20  Hicks 20   Trust me homers
@Matty_ice220 @TorresGleyber Gonna hold him back for free agent purposes and give the excuse he has only played a 30 or so games n 3A plus he coming off injury see ya @ all star break Gleyber
@KearaBrasi Yankee depth chart
Rotation   1 - Severino  2 - Tanaka  3 - Gray  4 - CC *  5 -Montgomery - Adams - German - Acevedo - Green * - Cessa - Cortes
C - Sanchize - Romine  1B - Bird - Headley -Austin- Romine  2b - Toe - Wade  3b - Andujar - Headley - Toe -Wade  SS - Didi - Toe - Wade  LF - Gardy - Frazier -Hicks  CF -Hicks - Ells -Gardy  RF - Judge - Stanton - Hicks - Fraz  DH -Stanton -Judge - Sanchez
Here we go my GM skills - trade Headley give keys 2 3rd 2 Andujar only problem he bats righty Castro gone let Wade or Toe start @ second  -trade Frazier get a good picther or prospect his equal - still have 5 OF for 3 spots
@AndrewMarchand And now
@iamErica_Mena ü§ö
@Mr_LightSkin31 I wish
@Dick_Harper Yes &amp; Yanks still n position to get under tax who could‚Äôve thought that maybe a Headley trade or Ells even Gardy someone in the OF has to go literally have 2 many players with Frazier McKinney &amp; Cave sitting n 3A &amp; Florial prob starting n 2A
@BlacKardKD @Writer165 @jimcallisMLB @Marlins @Yankees He is better as is Abreau Adams and maybe even Acevedo but damn Guzman is a lottery ticket ceiling if ace floor of closer
@Writer165 @jimcallisMLB @Marlins @Yankees Wouldn‚Äôt have been mad @ Tate and both of last years pics
@JonHeyman Prob mad they did
@SamDykstraMiLB @MiLB And kept Acevedo &amp; Abreau the newest members well at least one will b of the top 100 but quite honestly Guzman will be a top 100 before long
@pinstripenyy People forget he‚Äôs only 28 not 30 something  &amp; Ellsbury is a speed first player not to mention ells hasn‚Äôt fallen off a cliff he‚Äôs never played up 2 contract from day 1 that‚Äôs his issue sonterrible comparison
@jimcallisMLB @Marlins @Yankees Guzman will be an ace and will breeze thru the farm system and be top 100 by mid season hate 2 c him go
@Mr_LightSkin31 Guzman was top ten will be a top 100 this year we did give up a prospect and devers will be good
@Dick_Harper Love the deal the average money will be less then what they were gonna spend on Manny or Bryce didn‚Äôt wanna c Guzman go he‚Äôs gonna be really good gonna be n hi A this year
@SamDykstraMiLB @MiLB He‚Äôs gonna be really good shoulda gave up someone else not him yankees had all the leverage Devers I‚Äôm cool with all things considered
@BenBadler Don‚Äôt wanna c Guzman go potential ace people don‚Äôt know that maybe a lil older for the league he was n but his secondary stuff took huge steps woulda been n Tampa at some point this season
@JamezSagardia @Ken_Rosenthal Why do they need too Hicks n center Gardy n left Ells backing up center Hicks backing up left Gardy backing up center Frazier plays left cave plays all 3
@Ken_Rosenthal Don‚Äôt care bout how much they took what‚Äôs the average salary in the books gotta be roughly 22 not so bad much less then Harper or Manny woulda cost
@Buster_ESPN @jaysonst Starlin was part of the trade
@Buster_ESPN @jaysonst Take out Headley out n Andujar
@TheBrooklynLife He can go where does he even play now gotta be Scranton cuz Hicks Judge Gardy Ells and Stanton is waaaaay to many outfielders to carry including Clint plays Florial will be up soon
@Dick_Harper Not mad at that 24 million gone 25 million coming n can still sign CC
@Mr_LightSkin31 Love it if it‚Äôs taking on money and no major prospects r lost
@SirMott87 He can go was never high on him
@JackCurryYES Noooooo he‚Äôs on the verge of being a ‚≠êÔ∏è why would they get anyone in the top 10 &amp; only putting up 35milli that‚Äôs not cool at all common jack Cashmans knows better they have all the leverage
@JonHeyman Only 35 mill better not be any prospects I like I‚Äôm talking tier 2-3 guys
@Feinsand Opting out of 200 plus n ya twilight years seems nuts he‚Äôll be 31 n 20 what team gonna give him 200+ going into that age
Taking on that amount of money the Yankees better not be giving up any A list prospects like seriously no Medina Martinez or Guzman none of them at 25 a year now they must get rid of Gardy Headley or hopefully Ells
If ass don‚Äôt match legs transfer that fat 2 thighs &amp; calves
@TheGreatWhite Could live with that
@HolyCowRizzuto @JonHeyman Crazy no way
@JonHeyman No prospects if they taking that money - Ells - Gardy - headley
@JonHeyman Hmmmm that‚Äôs a pretty big market out there 2 so much for small market and chances to win r theyvreally gonna beat houston with or w/o him
@jjcoop36 lol I bet
@TheRealDarius33 Lesser of evils  my friend until the alternative come front center lesser of Evils
@KenDavidoff @KevinParrishJr Not too mention the fake Adam warren shot green will get Mitchell and Cessa still around Cortes if he‚Äôs not plucked koermer deserves a shot
@KenDavidoff @KevinParrishJr All they need is CC how long are adams &amp; Acevedo gonna sit n 3A without a fair shot - German proved he‚Äôs a legit and Sheffield - Abreau - Guzman - Perez - Medina &amp; Martinez coming up quickly
@Teh_Real_LoCo @pinstripealley No keep Florial keep Abreau headley plays third until andujar is ready torres starts n 3a gets reps gets healthy til all star break - machado won‚Äôt sign with anyone so nobody is gonna sign him he wants free agency so he will get it it‚Äôll only cost money and the draft pick
@jimcallisMLB @whitesox @Braves @Padres Braves took a huge hit u still have them top 5 after losing all them players ??
@Buster_ESPN Pretty damn nice lineup
@Teh_Real_LoCo @pinstripealley Dumb ass fuck give up Half ya farm for a guy that‚Äôs about to be a free agent In the following offseason
@MelissaAOlcott Lol thank u
Republicans: The party that fought tooth &amp; nail to stop gay marriage on the basis that it would lead to pedophilia, are now fighting tooth &amp; nail to elect a pedophile into Congress.
@CNN She‚Äôs suck a fuckig idiot she Disgusts me even looking at her do Interviews  and hearing a repulsive annoying ass voice
Very good Atl very good job congrats Keesh !!!
Freedom is what u do with what‚Äôs been done 2 u !!! Think bout that for a second
I think turtle necks r back see them n all the magazines
@AlexVandengo @jjcoop36 Solak - Estrada - w garcia - d garcia - torres - t wade - Park all 22 &amp; younger
@BenBadler I imagine if u bought a Mercedes G wagon and later found out Benz cheated on the lease application so they gave u the car and Said u now own it as punishment to Mercedes that would be a pretty happy day
@JonathanMayo question of the day is Thairo Estrada gonna be a better option then Wade - Torreyes -&amp; Solak at Any infield positions 2nd short or 3rd
@jimcallisMLB top üíØ yanks  torres top 5  Florial top 50 Sheffield top 50  Adams top 50  Andujar top 70 Abreau top 90  Acevedo -Solak - Guzman - Estrada top 150   Am I spot on ?....
I understand the hustle I promise I do but if I want a dance i promise I know how 2 beckon u - ya ass on my knee isn‚Äôt gonna make the Dollaz rain / no pun intended

So lemme get this Liangelo Ball gets caught shop lifting abroad suspended indefinitely from UCLA pop decides to take him outta school get him ready for the league maybe Japanese league but league none the less and give him a signature shoe - gotta love it
@jjcoop36 Hoping this year it all comes together for him secondary pitches showed much improvement and promise last season could shoot up rankings if he slightly puts it together
@BenBadler I c Thairo &amp; Medina made huge jumps don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the latter unless your going strictly based on potential
@BenBadler Latter
@Benito2325 @BaseballAmerica Doubt that very seriously Unless maybe accuracy decided this one
Just realized Prince Henrys fianc√© is shorty from Suits guessing Mike Ross can‚Äôt compete with the Prince lol
@Joelsherman1 At least Texas makes a lil sense maybe warmer weather even tho DALLAS /Arlington is not a small market but chicago makes absolutely no sense
@AndrewMarchand And Salinas and Marte so having that money wont be a total waste
@JonathanMayo bummed out by not signing Othani but they will prob get Marte &amp; Salinas and Maithan from the Braves
@jimcallisMLB how far do u c Blake Rutherford falling after another dissapointing season out the top 50 I‚Äôd imagine and also has Albert Abreau hit the top 100
@newkingofmedia @BaseballAmerica @BobbyMilone29 Depending on if they sign Othani or maithan both would b top 10
@newkingofmedia @BaseballAmerica @BobbyMilone29 Ummm def not Estrada Tate or McKinney goes torres -Florial  -Sheffield - adams - Abreau - andujar - Acevedo - Guzman - solak - Perez with Tate - Thairo n top 15 McKinney cracks top 20
Trump is really fucking America up I hope everyone that voted for his is happy with themselves do we really can we at this point really think Hillary would be worse ?
Live ya best life fuck everyone else !!!
@RealMichaelKay @AndrewMarchand @AaronBoone_ESPN Amazing story great guy but we need 97 wins and a World Series trophy how does that help

Frank is cool but Donavan Mitchell What the knicks needed !!!!
@MLBPipeline @MLB Does he become a top 100 prospect as well
@iamErica_Mena üòç
@jimcallisMLB early prediction - Torres top 5  Florial top 50  Adams top 50  Sheffield top 60  Andujar top 75  Abreau top 100  Acevedo peripheral  Solak good season n  promotion 2 3A away Guzman 1 big season away from top 100
@MLBPipeline But neither n top 100 lol justvgoes to show how weak the system is
Supporting the new tax bill is blasphemous can‚Äôt believe Senate is even considering this - can we hurry and take control of the house &amp; Senate
@GangstaBooQOM Mtown what up !!

Matt Lauer lost his job. Charlie Rose lost his job. Mark Halperin lost his job. Glenn Thrush lost his job. Billy Bush lost his job.  Harvey Weinstein lost his job. Kevin Spacey lost his job. But in politics... Conyers still in Congress. Moore still running. Trump still President.
Wooooow now matt lauer smh these sexual indiscretions r reaching   epidemic  proportions
@CNN And the tax plan has left them further behind silly them for thinking trump would give them a chance fucking idiot
@NanasiaMusic Facts
Question of the day is Senate gonna allow this tax reform bill 2 go thru - it‚Äôs actually kind of disgusting they would do people like that
@keithlaw Shoulda thought about that when the new CBA was done he cares cuz it‚Äôs his commission his client
@iamErica_Mena üëÄ
@Pacman072286 @JonHeyman Yanks have DH
@JonHeyman Yankees forgone conclusion money - endorsements - large Asian population - good young team - success with Japanese players - spotlight - Dh - bring cc back 6 man rotation
@jimcallisMLB @MLBDraft As long as torres - Florial - adams - Sheffield - Andujar &amp; Abreau and possibly Acevedo then all is well n baseball land
@jimcallisMLB why do I feel like Miguel Andujar isn‚Äôt getting proper attention everyone is waiting on Gleyber &amp; 4 good reason but Miguel is gonna be somewhere hitting 285 with 25 homers playing decent 3rd base
@jungela Mine 2
@briasoboojie Bitch please what the biz she‚Äôs not nothing to me what‚Äôs the biz idiot watch the show
ME Monday night is back !!!! https://t.co/TNDNbSZtHf
So if yankees sign Othani do they then become #1 farm system with the #1 player even though he won‚Äôt play a game n minors @keithlaw
Indeed we should top notch 3A rotation and don‚Äôt forget Abreau maybe by mid season  exciting times n Scranton
Jack - Lee - niki - Dotson - Hardaway - all higher on 1-2 position depth chart then baker &amp; session
Ron baker n G league &amp; Ramon session deep on bench pull n 10 milli per year between them coulda found better way to spend that üíµ üí¥ üí∞
Outfield glut as well Ells - Hicks - Gardy - Judge - Frazier - McKinney &amp; Cave coming with Florial tight behind them
U thought yankee rotation is full infield just as bad Sanchez - ü¶Ö - Castro - didi then u have headley &amp; Andujar with torres coming Wade battling Toe with thairo coming
Triple A rotation will be beast Acevedo - Sheffield - Adams - Cessa - German maybe even Montgomery
Yanks coming 2 camp with loads of pitchers who will 5 b Severino - Tanaka - Gray - Montgomery - German - Green - Adams - Cessa - Mitchell ( CC - Othani ) 2 full rotations worth of guys looking 4 innings
Damn can March get here spring training already
@RealSkipBayless A w is a w whats ya point
@Rosenbergradio @drocktrot We referring 2 a dis track or careers cuz either or I need answers
So last year Time magazine called me &amp; told me I‚Äôd prob b man of the year but I didn‚Äôt wanna do the interview or the photo shoot so I passed thanks anyway guys
@stengel Guess that‚Äôs put his fake time cover n perspective
This year biggest jump in Yankees prospect ranking will be johnny lasagna or Louis Medina I‚Äôm betting in big years from both
Yankee have lots of top üíØ talent  Torres - Florial - adams - Sheffield - andujar - Abreau - Acevedo maybe - Guzman shortly - solak maybe - Perez eventually -
Porzongis is the star but kanter is why they r winning ?
@SimpnMild @XxxStylez Wonder if he goes 2 jail if he doesn‚Äôt pay his child support
@GangstaBooQOM Tellem Boo M- town
@SamanthaHyatt @youloveSannxo I‚Äôm waiting

Enisha kanter might b the best center n the east
Obviously this new IFA money is for Othani but the yanks r linked 2 a couple more Latin American kids dunno exactly where from 2 top 15 prospects sonifbhe doesn‚Äôt come expect it 2 b spend quickly anyhow
@JonathanMayo who will yankees loose &amp; add 2day common bro need answers before 8 I say shreve - smith &amp; maybe Mitchell go thairo - McKinney - Abreau - torres - Acevedo get added
Lotta deals will be struck today with the rule 5 thing going down tonight Yanks already made 2 trades expect bout 11 more

Knicks trying 2 b faster &amp; get rid of the gluttton of 5s how does a Jalil Okafor help that ? Would b a dumb move besides Kanter is ballin !!
@Mumble1 Of course
Never forget the only thing phil Jackson did right n NY (KP) was only because Jalil Okafor was taken
@CNN Possible trump will use this as an I told u so moment
@CNN Good save him so U can kill him the right way
@jimcallisMLB @MLBazFallLeague Florial - Acuna - Robles then end
Had 2 check on my pops he‚Äôs the AD @ BMCC right across the street from all the madness n NYC - walks that bike path everyday crazy üôèüèæ out
‚ÄúThe two bst longterm prospects in the Arizona Fall League are Ronald Acuna(OF, Braves) and Estevan Florial(OF, Yankees)" per Peter Gannon‚Äôs
@DidiGoatorious @Steve_Milla @pgammo Yanks wondering where 2 play Andujar Torres - Estrada - Wade &amp; Toe What were they gonna do with Mateo although I lived him just no room
@DidiGoatorious @Steve_Milla @pgammo KAP is never healthy where does Fowler fall n yankees OF Judge - Hicks - Frazier  - Florial - Gardy - Ells -McKinney
@bigyankeefan420 @pgammo 2 years whose not around Gardy contract expires so we know he‚Äôll be gone still have Hicks - Frazier - Judge - Ells - McKinney

@jimcallisMLB what would the AZFL be considered In terms of competition level I know it‚Äôs hitter friendly but what level 2A ??
@JonathanMayo Gotcha well Thairo &amp; Sheffield will be cooking final vote for McKinney - Florial theyll prob split the vote &amp; other dude will win
@MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport Fucking classic
@_DGotGame_ Think ur right it‚Äôll go 7
@JonathanMayo How is Abreau not n the AZFL all star Game is it that political that he will actually have won player of the week &amp; still not make all star
The President &amp; his team r nuts never seen anything like this remember we aren‚Äôt even a full year in !!!
@TByse Congrats god is good
So if Astros win tomorrow we will know if Tanaka opts out by Friday if not early next week - the game within th Game yankee fans

@Ms_Polished The new one the craziest
Hey big head  @iamErica_Mena !!
With yankees essentially letting everyone go they have opened the doors for marlins 2 b Yankees South Beach
Y‚Äôall ready for the return of Mr Monday nights ?? !!

@billmaher really gotta screen these guests better these guys r terrible &amp; make no fucking sense the black the white guy = horrible
@keithlaw I‚Äôll take 6 outta 7 especially if Abreau continues 2 dominate AZFL &amp; jumps Acevedo then we can discuss Acevedo &amp; Solak n July
@keithlaw Torres - adams - Florial - Andujar - Sheffield - Abreau - Acevedo NY 100 prospects 2 start 18 Sauer -Guzman - Solak just outiside
@JonathanMayo Torres - adams - Florial - Andujar - Sheffield - Abreau - Acevedo top 100 prospects 2 start 18 Guzman - Solak right outside
@Tiffanieromeyba Scripted *
@Tiffanieromeyba Notransition here I was always cocky and arrogant before tv scriptured or not
@JonathanMayo Andujar should get the spring training look at third frazier not coming back Headley could play 1st DH 3rd with Torres n 3A getting right
Love &amp; Hip Hop Marathon on VH1 4 days of Mr Monday night leading up 2 the premiere of season 8 on Monday night tune in !!!
@Amiyatype_ Dope pic

@Feinsand Man U don‚Äôt stop with that nonsense flaherty barely has enough charisma to be a mortician
Just saw the dumbest thing ever someone proposed a Kyle Schwarber for Louis Severino deal yankees better not even think about it
@AndrewMarchand Wonder why
@NYPinstripes4ev Sounds bout right
@TheGreatWhite He couldnt handle third base why the hell would they put him n charge of a team
@bennysportsfan @keithlaw Well ima need Benny 2 know Oppenheimer isn‚Äôt even n the Yankee org anymore but I get ya point I imagine
@AnthonyatMid @keithlaw Pay attention idiot pay roll will be bout 140 3 days after World Series
@keithlaw Maybe it was his decision not 2 come back
Girardi is a goner - couldn‚Äôt b BL happier at least until the next manager is worse
@Fyocca123 @JonathanMayo U know I ‚ù§Ô∏è me some Florial but he gotta get them Ks down 2 25pct he‚Äôd be an all star perennial all ‚≠êÔ∏è
@Fyocca123 @JonathanMayo Yes as is Thairo hitting better then both Florial &amp; Mckinney but all playing representative Sheffield pitching well but nobody like Abreau
@jimcallisMLB Albert Abreau killing AZFL is he gonna start season n ya top üíØ should b n double a 2 start season 2 runs 15 innings
World Series Is on BUT damn how bout that Abreau 2 runs n 15 innings of AZFL @JonathanMayo predicting he starts season in top 100 and n 2A
@BronxPinstripes Please have him
@JonathanMayo damn the World Series how bout that Abreau

New obsession prospect rankings @JonathanMayo get ready for an inordinate amount of tweets coming ya way
@KingZito973 ima a fan indeed but Yankees don‚Äôt pay me I can turn page very easily - follow fall league &amp; c whose coming &amp; going I‚Äôll b good til Feb
175 games later ‚öæÔ∏ès over when Yankees r out so am I no sportscenter or sporttalk knicks r bad &amp; KAP is jobless guess L&amp;HH it is c ya Monday
@_DGotGame_ Nope apparently not next year we do it again
@KingZito973 Who ??
CC dud Kahnle dud offense dud not the way to go out fuck it c ya n Feb when pitchers and catchers report
Channel changed
That‚Äôll do it
@Fyocca123 If he beasts n spring training all bets off
Still feeling like Andujar is the third baseman of the Future
Every miscue by Castro is a step closer to the Gleyber era @ 2nd
@TheoSHK @JonHeyman Miguel
@JonHeyman Stop it
@KingZito973 And I take Sanchez bat over romine glove at that position everyday and 2wice on Sunday
@KingZito973 He‚Äôs fine Game caller common look at metrics only issue he has behind plate is blocking that scares him from callin some pitches
@Fyocca123 Hurt starting season n 3A only had a few triple A at bats if he‚Äôs balling midseason call up that means Andujar &amp; Castro better be ballin
@KingZito973 U crazy as hell if u think romine is starting behind the plate n a win or go home game Sanchize catches DH free up prob Headley
CC comes back -Tanaka opts out -T Frazier isn‚Äôt resigned -Gardy unfortunately is shopped -No takers for Ells contract Andujar takes over 3rd
Feeling good bout tonight‚Äôs yankee Game may wanna watch alone tho if it goes left I might loose my mind - common CC
Ok Dellin thank u
@_DGotGame_ Well b there
@_DGotGame_ C ya next week
I want Betances
Case and point
If they called high strikes on Altuve like they call low ones on Judge he wouldn‚Äôt hit 800 that I can guarantee
My bad &amp; Sheffield is n Az as well not 2 mention Solak - Perez - Guzman - Heller  r on peripheral waiting on a chance
What‚Äôs scary 4 Yankees opponents is Torres is recovering Frazier Andujar arent dressing Florial Abreau r n AZ - Adams - Acevedo still n 3A
Get work richie d https://t.co/zzVTeYJ3gS
I‚Äôm just different everything is done bigger &amp; better with me !!!
@jimcallisMLB how close r Acevedo &amp; Abreau to opening next season n the top üíØ
@JonathanMayo Wasn‚Äôt Callis was a major league scout
@JonathanMayo they r saying Abreau is the best pitcher n the AZFL that includes a top 20 guy &amp; Sheffield do u 4c him n ya upcoming top 100
The knicks r as advertised - HOTT GARBAGE
@Joelsherman1 Frazier doesn‚Äôt play CF and how much they like him will depend on how much Ellsbury money they eat or trading Gardy Hicks just turned 28
@davidtabrown @Joelsherman1 Exactly Murphy not Hughes
@AndrewMarchand Pretty close 2 tho think yanks have decided next year spring training is his time not gonna make any moves like that and rattle the cage
@AndrewMarchand Betances won‚Äôt loose his post season spot everyone sounds nuts he‚Äôs a 4x all star and they not gonna ruin him for next year
@iamErica_Mena Yes indeed
Catch me &amp; sis Monday the 30th we baaaaaaack !!! https://t.co/yN0jasEDPY
He‚Äôs def gonna opt out now unless the loyalty kicks n - he can get 100 milli
The real Tanaka !!!!
These yAnkees just seem different
@NYPinstripes4ev Yes u r
These Yankees r different !!!!
Chapman time but how do u not bring T Frazier back jersey guy looks happy as hell 2b here &amp; is n the middle of everything @JonathanMayo
Big Yankee moments for the baby bombers here n 8th Didi Judge Frazier Sanchize Headley all come thru big
Damn Gordon Heyward apparently goes down while Yankees r coming back bostonjust can‚Äôt  catch a break üôèüèæ go out to him for a speedy recovery
Wooooow everyone is bailed out so far it‚Äôs 0-0 for a minute
Yo I love starlin Castro but seriously wtf is he thinking couldn‚Äôt possibly have thought that was faster then running thru the bag
@Yankees And still counted for 1 run
I can tell how that pitcher walked off the mound he voted for trump
All of a sudden starlin error looks huge let‚Äôs c how this plays out
Gray pitched well but I never felt comfortable every inning 20 pitches men on Mcullers having 10 pitch innings just seemed more dominant
@Buster_ESPN just tweeted 21 2/3 innings of playoff baseball for sonny gray &amp; not 1 run scored for him - now that‚Äôs sad he deserves better
@ktsharp @Buster_ESPN Damn shame
Wtf was that starlin answering my question about what to do with Gleyber Torres tonight I suppose
@jaysonst Every time I c hit down the line I ask why does Frazier play so far off the line every single time gives up doubles instead of singles
Yankees needed this 1 Sonny Gray stat line looks ok but it looked like n every inning it could fall apart and it did on Robertson‚Äôs watch
If I was sonny gray I‚Äôd ask to b out he‚Äôs gotta hate NY
Guess that says it down 3 guess Gray couldn‚Äôt have done that smh
I assume Gray couldn‚Äôt have done that bases loaded no outs not good yankees go down just by how much
I honestly don‚Äôt blame Sonny Gray for hating NY he does deserve better shoulda finished the inning he earned it
R u fucking kidding me a walk &amp; an interference how innings starts -sonny gray hates being here I can c it in his üëÄ that‚Äôs smile said it all
Player is safe @ first but didn‚Äôt touch bag heading back penaltys offset he‚Äôs out !!!!
@NYPinstripes4ev Didn‚Äôt touch bag going back penalty‚Äôs offset he‚Äôs out
U better challenge that call Joe
don‚Äôt get why yankees don‚Äôt take what‚Äôs given like really a bunt down third is an auto hit first second 0 outs isn‚Äôt that a good thing
So I‚Äôm hearing trump stuckbhis foot n his mouth again what was Said I missed it something that has üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà enraged - hanging gay people
Ok maybe only 4 pitches
@jcrasnick Makes sense but what‚Äôs ya point
Common Sanchize ohhh my bad that‚Äôs Romine smh
Castro just added 8-10 pitches 2 grays count with that error
Gray throws a lot of pitches &amp; just never seems n control but with that said Castro has to field the damn ball on that routine grounder
people took outta context my quitting the show tweet smh if u pay any attention instead of looking 4 hyperbole n posts it woulda made sense
Don‚Äôt understand why people r saying the lineup is being shaken up romine catches 1 game outta 9 Sanchize is DH big deal
@UncleWillySon That would be crazy all things considered an embarrassment of riches
@TheKingKoala27 @JonathanMayo Gleyber won‚Äôt b ready til mid season needs ABs n 3A I def want Andujar to get his shot he deserves it done nothing but mash all the way up
Is Frazier playing his way back into NY or have yanks already decided 2 go with kids get under tax or can the do both @JonathanMayo
Yanks 2 many @ 3rd Frazier -Headley - Andujar - Torres &amp; n OF Judge - Gardy - Ells -Hicks -Frazier &amp; util  Wade vs Toe decisions decisions
Yanks rotation looks set up for years 2 come Severino - Monty - Gray - Tanaka (opt n)- CC (resign) Acevedo - Adams - Sheffield -
@Jerome92198458 I retired ya moma pussy
@Mz_ThickCoCo Been has enough to retire sweety stay woke google me
@NYPinstripes4ev Of course wouldn‚Äôt do anything else
@LUCKY_CAPO Tonight I imagine I‚Äôd be referring to the cumulative mentions as opposed to the singular pay attention
Trump lies about everything like seriously everything it‚Äôs raining but I walk outside it‚Äôs sunny -don‚Äôt understand how his cabinet allows it
Back to houston and more ‚öæÔ∏è extended season since clearly I don‚Äôt watch üèà
Ima retire from L&amp;HH &amp; just let people talk about me in there scenes
Same shit different year
@Fyocca123 But Headley is essentially same age and is signed for 13 milli so Headley stays
@RealSkipBayless Vandy
I imagine todd Frazier loves playing @ Home but this is his FA contract coming up he better get his money and it won‚Äôt b n pinstripes
Clear yankees prefer Frazier 2 Headley what happens when season is over &amp; Fraziers FA &amp; Headley has 1 year left @JackCurryYES
@jimcallisMLB @MLBPipeline @MLBazFallLeague With the way Sheffield &amp; Florial r playing n AZFL do u foresee a top 50 &amp; 30 preseason rankings respectively and Acevedo cracking top 100
@jimcallisMLB @MLBPipeline @MLBazFallLeague What Yanks gonna do with Miguel Andujar &amp; Clint Frazier really doesn‚Äôt seem to be space on team for either presently constructed
Trump dont worry bout AROD or football how bout learning what regions u preside over of a quick geography lesson like PR or US Virgin Isles
Doesn‚Äôt matter whose around at the beginning the trick is 2 b around at the end !!!
Rise shine give God the glory
@miakhalifa smh tried to say hi didn‚Äôt realize they were putting u out the game - what happened
@BarstoolHubbs @NYPinstripes4ev Bad week for shorty Gilbert Arenas aired her out for sliding n his dms smh does that show still come in worse week ever - I‚Äôm nominating her
@AndrewMarchand How bout ask him before pulling him a convo is always good
hard 2 trade Gardner seems like club house leader &amp; glue Ellsbury contract obviously n love with Hicks &amp; Judge = Jeter short straw C Frazier
the guy we traded 2 get Cessa &amp; more importantly GREEN didn‚Äôt make the Cubs division roster - wonder how the haters feel now Cashmans 4 Prez
