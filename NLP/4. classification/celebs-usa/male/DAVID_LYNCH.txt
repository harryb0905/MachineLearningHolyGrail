Dear Twitter Friends, This thing is so good. @lissiemusic and her band are so good. http://t.co/PXBSgOyi
Dear Twitter Friends, Here is the link to Evan's article: http://t.co/7bdsfjY2
Bill Maher could have a great talk w/Evan, he should have him on his show some time.
Check it out if you can. As Evan describes it, “ A light tough on a heavy subject.”
Dear Twitter Friends, thousands of you enjoyed Evan Finkelstein's last writings. His latest piece in Elephant Magazine is called, “God.”
Dear Twitter Friends, I'll be at @amoebamusic Hollywood tomorrow at 7pm for a signing. Big Dean Hurley will DJ the event. Come if you can.
"Crazy Clown Time" is available on @iTunesMusic http://t.co/foawLqMV (US) http://t.co/XymdlvfT (intl). Rock on Twitter Friends.
Dear Twitter Friends, please hang on. I’m working on Step One for the secret to Real Peace.
The secret to Real Peace, I will tell you next week if you ask me. All the best to you. Your friend, David.
I want to tell you how REAL PEACE can be a reality for us all. It's time to stop pretending that our dear politicians can solve anything.
I am traveling now but will be back home next week. Please ask me about Maharishi's Peace Creating Groups.
Dear Twitter Friends, let's take a look at this World of Ours. So much suffering these days, so many problems, so much negativity.
Today me & Dean, will be on Morning Becomes Eclectic on @KCRW in 20 minutes. You can listen here: http://t.co/AYn5Hilb
Dear Twitter Friends you can preorder my album "Crazy Clown Time" on iTunes. http://t.co/foawLqMV (US) http://t.co/XymdlvfT (International)
Now I'm working on a lithograph called “Oh, A Bad Dream Comes.” Please tell me what you are working on and about your dreams for the future.
I was very busy working on the installation of a show on mathematics at the Fondation Cartier in Paris.
Dear Twitter Friends, I'm sorry I haven’t been in touch with you for awhile.
I really think you will like this music. So take a ride on This Train. http://t.co/xXzBa01M
Her album is finally finished and it's called "This Train."
Dear Twitter Friends, I've been working w/ @Chrysta_Bell for many years. She's such a great singer. A real beauty she is.
This can really happen. Let’s figure a way to work together & make this happen for our world family.  Thank you for listening & considering.
Let’s get rid of the suffering and bring real peace, which is not just the absence of war, but the absence of all negativity.
Too many people are suffering these days.
Let’s get together somehow and figure a way to support large peace creating groups in the world on a permanent basis.
If we wait believing leaders in Washington will bring real peace, then I think we'd all have to finally agree we’re living in a dream world.
Maharishi’s Peace Creating Groups do just this.
I truly believe there is a field of peace within & that it can be enlivened & brought to the surface to be enjoyed by all.

"Nothing in life has to be taken seriously - except the joy of life." – Maharishi
I am That eternal Being, Thou art That, and all this is That eternal Being in its essential nature. - Maharishi
It is the be-all and end-all of existence, the all-pervading eternal field of the almighty creative intelligence.
It is eternal & unbounded, the basis of all the phenomenal existence of the cosmic life. It is the source of all time, space, and causation.
Being is the ultimate reality of all that was, is or will be.
Existence, life or Being is the unmanifested reality of all that exists, lives, or is.

@jimpascoe Remember it takes 4 consecutive days of teaching & it's nice for teachers to get some money for teaching and the organization...
@jimpascoe And if that is still too much, you can write the David Lynch Foundation & get half off that, which is $375.
@jimpascoe The cost is down from what it used to be, but if it's still too high & you are a hardship case, you can get half off.
