@TheReal_Calicoe I know some of this will get misunderstood and that's fine. But again, I can't really articulate my thoughts on here lol
@TheReal_Calicoe Also. Kap was all alone last year in protest. Year later we are all in an uproar. If it was on like that we would've been mad then. Feel me?
I haven't found the right words to articulate my view points without being emotional so I've been quiet. But soon
Man. So much goes through my mind when I listen to news and hear things Americans are debating about. Makes me feel tons of emotions.
@blk_tray Hit apple next week

Cool. And I have the same right to say they suck just like they think I do. https://t.co/afjoelqLUi
So crazy to me that all these nerds cover all sports. Not one athletic bone in their body with all the opinions and analysis.

Hi Blair  https://t.co/TR82VQAsw6
Goodnight  https://t.co/sGekmQXC2O
@tloc103 and only people I took a shot at were those who shot first, not those who had an opinion.
@AbTheLeafFan thank u kindly
Goodnight ma'am  https://t.co/QZXNySA1M3
@PhilClancyII summer boredom bro lol
@AbTheLeafFan correct
Am I? Or am I simply responding to ignorance coming my way first? Lol https://t.co/5RfUdOJVez
@DiggzWorld and you need to be making music. So you leave me alone and I'll leave you alone?
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
@tloc103 so what? You take a shot. I take a shot. Yall not immune to me giving my opinion back because you "pay my salary"
@ferddieee lol you got 15 followers bro. You know hard it is to only have 15 followers? Lol you gotta really really be bad at life 😂😭😂
@amyfadoolCSN well, you'd have to correct the front line first in my opinion and those are the cameras.
@PaidQuaid I don't think so. Just would like them to be moved back
I have people mad at me for something they've literally never experienced 😂😭😂😭. How does that work?
I hope they tie  https://t.co/AYSDkpU1eQ
@beth_lee and with my not so bad life I make a living with my body, in which I hope doesn't collide with a camera during a game.. Sweetheart
@Love__Dinero I'm not defending flopping or none of that. But it's countless times guys run into cameras and get hurt
@TheRealDeezy_ @Cribbo you're right. Tonight I am. But you've twitted from the crib all your life bro lol
And the camera you're watching the game on is damn near in the suites lol. Stop it  https://t.co/J2USSDs0ei
@MrMonroe88 and you don't get paid enough.
My bad. I forgot how many of Yall have ran into a cameraman during a game lol. Continue
@bornleaderfam however he got there, I just know that's been an issue
Players been complaining about that for years
Now maybe we can get the cameramen moved back
@Spooooooon11 what he say to you dawg? 😭😭
