@AllPlanets Hope you get something for that. @Northstar_CA has never been good at customer service
@spetty80 @CoClassicPro Wish we could do more of this stuff! Awesome way to promote development and education
@CoClassicPro This is awesome! Great job @spetty80
@philgaimon @BenKing89 @andrewtalansky I was born2 1/2 months premature and my lungs weren‚Äôt developed. Spend a long time in boston medical center in an incubator. Doctors said my physiology would be shit. Still suffer from breathing problems today. Hard work and mental toughness &gt; physiology
@CryptoChoe Yesterday you‚Äôre scared, today you‚Äôre stoked üòÇü§î
@philgaimon It ain‚Äôt the HOP ride....
@stevepooch @TeamCAbike @fastfreddie1973 @CycleutionAJ Thanks Steve! I‚Äôm sure you know this well. Hope you‚Äôre doing great.
I recently wrote an article about what it means to me to be a volunteer for the sport I love. Have a read and let me know if you‚Äôd like to be involved. https://t.co/A55HMMRafr @TeamCAbike @fastfreddie1973 @CycleutionAJ
@BenKing89 Hopefully some donuts in there
@freddreier @velonews And yet, still, many of these riders who were or are still scrambling to find a ‚Äújob‚Äù are still paying their own way.
@nbctitangames this may be one of the worst shows (although I can‚Äôt stop watching). Why don‚Äôt you try putting equal size athletes vs. each other? Show make no sense pitting 300lb dude against a 150lb dude in a weight lifting contest. @TheRock
Never forget #tillery #CFPlayoff @JerryTillery https://t.co/eR21wjc1fP
@gplama Wow...
Couldn‚Äôt agree more https://t.co/KjqoIHcSox
@AYF You‚Äôre charging to stream the games?
@ryantrebon @philgaimon Because Strava is the new golf
@philgaimon Did they test for a motor though ü§î
@philgaimon Will this mean I get my mt. Hamilton back?
Data shows travel teams is killing youth sports https://t.co/0bnJrA0iqh
@dunkindonuts should stick to what they‚Äôre good at...donuts and coffee.
@Ben_Wolfe Ya but you‚Äôre in New England ...
‚ÄúSports in America have separated into sports-haves and have-nots.‚Äù  https://t.co/isxGOXduB9
@JetBlue Just letting fellow bike riders know about the ridiculous fees. Thanks
I used to like @jetblue until they charged me more for my bike than my entire round trip. Bike riders, don‚Äôt fly jet blue #scam #ripoff
@RobinmCarpenter @Laura_Weislo Gravel grinders and grand fondos taking much of the market share the past year.  Not enough ROI for investors
@jimstemper @JoeDombro Guess you need to come back and defend...
@OaklandTriClub Super sad news about @ajeeckman. Started riding with him as a young junior and was great to see how well he was doing. Be safe out there everyone.
@baronbiosys great concept. I want to try!
@beyondplm @PropelPLM @PLMOracle https://t.co/bUBqvywGPN
@velonews @JellyBellyTeam this is sad news. Sponsorship and races continue to dwindle in the US. The decline continues with no end in sight for the sport we all love and has given us so much.
@spetty80 @USBHOF Congrats Sean!
@DanMartin86 @LeTour It was great to call you a teammate and friend. Awesome to watch you this year. You deserve it. #fan
@TeamCAbike off the front solo @usacycling @USACyclingU23 road nationals #RoadNats
@TeamCAbike puts three in top 10 at @usacycling U23 National Time Trial Championships. Nice work gentlemen. @USACyclingU23
@cyclingtips Haha teams won‚Äôt return? I‚Äôm pretty sure there are a few that would love to do the tour.
@ChristianVDV @bobkeroll some pretty bad tactics at the end of the stage today. Why would you work with sprinter all the way to 700m to go and think you could outsprint him?
@ericgalenyoung dude...making it look way to easy
@theboz91 congrats man!!
@usacyclinglive Love to see when an amateur wins ‚ÄúUSPro‚Äù championships. @LAganzar
@LitecoinQueen @ltcninja He sounds about right to me
@averydemarr Crashed into a barrier during philly classic. I didn‚Äôt go down, but somehow managed to get my foot caught in the chainrings
Only 4 years ago??? Still have a nice scar. Chainrings &gt; carbon and ankles. https://t.co/8aGKAgURJy
@Tsvetkov13 @TourDeBeauce @EspoirsCentral Proud of you man. That‚Äôs not an easy course to hold the jersey on. Ready to see you crush everyone in Colorado!
@cdncyclist @SilberProTeam @FQSC @CyclingCanada Now that was a bike race! @TourDeBeauce
@TourDeBeauce @EspoirsCentral Lots can happen last lap... @Tsvetkov13
@don_hammons @AmericanAir Lines inside are out of control. Taking up half the ticketing area. Over an hour wait to get ticketed. @AmericanAir

Some motivation, tactics, and training advice with @fastfreddie1973 for @TeamCAbike. Racing season is just around the corner! https://t.co/f5PTRESN0i
@the_steve_cox ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about whether you win or lose, but it‚Äôs the courage to enter the race that counts‚Äù
@TeamCAbike training camp. Quick stop to fuel up with @peetscoffee and @GUEnergyLabs wearing our new @FastFreddieCycl kit https://t.co/1046gtuEe7
@the_steve_cox How‚Äôd it go???
@RallyQT Not just economic transactions btw
@BigCheds Too many times I‚Äôve thought we hit bottom ha
@CelesteW831 Less than a week
@JimMillerUSAC congrats Jim!
@philgaimon I think it depends on your age. Younger = outside, older = inside
@kpak82 @BigCheds I‚Äôm just holding like üò±üò±üò±
@davidgokhshtein I like it. David ‚Äúthe weatherman‚Äù gokhshtein
@davidgokhshtein You also said we would never see any lower price a few days ago at .11
@BigCheds I hope that means good things to come
@RoarkBen @davidgokhshtein @andy_ppsu His head will explode the bigger it gets
@venturecanvas Fake
@FinFreeFlex @BigCheds Just about there
@SatoshiLite I'd like to help. How can we get this started?
@davidgokhshtein @tweetornotto If we only knew where the bottoms were...
@davidgokhshtein @tweetornotto Well if you sold at .3 and bought again now on TRX you‚Äôd triple your earnings and hence try to get the money you‚Äôre looking for.
@tweetornotto @davidgokhshtein 5 cents is a lot to anyone when it‚Äôs a large percentage. Not just whales
@davidgokhshtein The smart hands
@davidgokhshtein Or people selling and buying again lower
@davidgokhshtein Weak hands or smart hands?
@BigCheds Can‚Äôt get out of its own way!
@two_wandering @thebradbecker 6500 ... your math is killing me
@two_wandering @MrKAMason It‚Äôs about market cap. Not about your delusion haha
@two_wandering And vice versa...
@two_wandering Haha ok
@MrKAMason @two_wandering You‚Äôre in too?
@two_wandering Done
@two_wandering No the bet is your evaluation of $65-150$ ripple. Not number 1 currency
@two_wandering Want to bet on it?
@two_wandering Ya ok...the market cap would be bigger than anything ever
@davidgokhshtein @BobbyDeschner @Crypto_Money1 I feel as though most coins have gone up at a similar rate in the past month?
@justinsuntron @juanbenet @bedehomender @IPFSbot @MineFilecoin Why would it be released if it wasn‚Äôt cross referenced?
@davidgokhshtein No just in general. Seems like knowing where the bottoms are is the hardest part
@davidgokhshtein I think the trick is to know how low the lows are...can you analyze that?
@davidgokhshtein @asifgoraya123 Everything will go up if you‚Äôre patient...
@davidgokhshtein Still waiting on the bounce up...
@TrippingMoon @SDistrictRadio Altcoins back today!
@GS612 Yay!
@davidgokhshtein Ok well let‚Äôs get some profits going
@davidgokhshtein Taking profits??? I guess Justin bombed. This is more than taking profits from .31 to .13
@BigCheds It needs some volume!!
@BigCheds what do you think about Litecoin?
@BigCheds So close
@BigCheds I figured. Just got to weather the storm!
@BigCheds Sell or hold?
@davidgokhshtein HODLing strong even though I lost a bunch after yesterday...
@TheCoinLawyer XRP?
@davidgokhshtein do any charting for Litecoin?
@TheCoinLawyer Lol lol lol
@TheCoinLawyer Run like hell?
@GS612 Agree. I hope it sustains but looks like we need more volume. Volume did pick up a bit though huh?
@GS612 It hit 261
@davidgokhshtein Where‚Äôs it going?
@ElliottGeorgio @CharlieHipHop @TheCoinLawyer huh? That was about XRP not Litecoin...
@TradesJoey Done
@CharlieHipHop @TheCoinLawyer @ElliottGeorgio I think that‚Äôs why I sold - big correction still coming I think
@oBraveOW @SatoshiLite @openbazaar Ahh ok good correction @SatoshiLite
@oBraveOW @SatoshiLite @openbazaar Really??
@SatoshiLite @openbazaar This was the big announcement?
@cryptoinvestors Did it break?
@ElliottGeorgio @TheCoinLawyer I have faith!
@TheCoinLawyer @ElliottGeorgio It seems like there is good back and forth with xrp and litecoin - when xrp goes down, litecoin up and vice versa - just need to be quick and not sleep ha
@TheCoinLawyer @ElliottGeorgio I agree - we need a good story or everyone to cash out of their xrp and buy ltc!
@TheCoinLawyer @ElliottGeorgio Also, if XRP went to $5 that would mean it is worth more than bitcoin (that's a possibility though)
@TheCoinLawyer @ElliottGeorgio Interesting prediction. Let's hope so - I'm holding both. (Litecoin down 43% from ATH which would make it sort of selling low). Just guessing here though.
@TheCoinLawyer @ElliottGeorgio I'm not sure. I can only say that Ripple is now the second highest coin in market cap and jumped 7.8x in a two weeks...so not sure what you're saying?
@ElliottGeorgio @TheCoinLawyer Don't they say "sell low buy high?" oh wait...
@TurcoBTC Does that mean people are selling their $BCH for $LTC ?
@barnhardt not late now...it just crashed pretty hard...
@Estato_Diritto @masterofcoinz I sure hope so guys! Thanks
@Estato_Diritto @masterofcoinz Ok well I will keep my fingers crossed for everyone. I thought it was only 23% on one day, but I'm glad to hear
@Estato_Diritto @masterofcoinz Really? With all the markets crashing at the same time more than 30%?
@masterofcoinz This is not one of those "dips"...this size of a dip hasn't happened since 2013...
@trentonfluetsch Remind yourself that we are all in this together and some deeper than others. Let‚Äôs all try to be patient #bitcoinsupportgroup
@trentonfluetsch It happens - you're probably still up
@agpatel86 @TheMrLitecoin haha isn't that funny...200 was so intense it made 257 seems ok...
@TheMrLitecoin No idea - but I literally saw $200
@TheMrLitecoin Don't look
@apemancooks I can't even watch
is now a time to panic? #Litecoin #Bitcoin #bitcoincrash #litecoincrash #blood
@Litecoin__News This chart basically changes every second
@MikeAimmes I don't know how many times I've seen this same statement in the last week
@SDistrictRadio Rough day
@CryptoHedge_ Seen it happen...and go down that quickly too
@CryptoHedge_ Waiting...
@CryptosQueen @VentureCoinist @TurboMacau Litecoin resistance on head and shoulders broke at 295 looks like
@5uperbobb @CryptosQueen I was thinking the same. Head and shoulders for Litecoin and Bitcoin
@CryptosQueen This looks like a head and shoulders pattern for Litecoin. Can you confirm?
@Landm_Marius I sure hope so
@SDistrictRadio One of these days, we are going to have a heart attack
@thepowerfulmax @SatoshiLite If that was the case, why did he sell now at the highest point just when Bitcoin Cash went to coinbase? Skeptical
@SatoshiLite This in itself is a conflict of interest
@SDistrictRadio @presidence_fr @iSpeakUK Did you buy the dip? I was too nervous
@Macca9126 It‚Äôs computers selling based on algorithms
@SDistrictRadio @scbmd13 I haven‚Äôt slept in weeks
@SDistrictRadio I sure hope so. It‚Äôs either filling us up or breaking our hearts
@M_Brendan55 @parkin_lee It will break our hearts
@SDistrictRadio Well ya, this is the way it goes. Resistances are for people who don‚Äôt want to short it...
@SDistrictRadio Your numbers...there‚Äôs no resistance. It hit 359...
@HauntedTrading @CryptosQueen Or past it...now...
@CryptosQueen I think we broke it...now what?
@PureQuik @SatoshiLite Seems like a repeat from last week at exactly the same time with the futures rolling out tomorrow
@PureQuik @SatoshiLite Like last week?
@nicolasesp1noza Does the money show up as a buy order instantly or only when processed and hits coinbase?
@CryptosQueen This doesn't make much sense when you see other cryptos going up (Ripple)
@AlexM0484 @whitzncrypt @StevenHeinrich_ @litecoin hope you're right...
@24SteveTaylor Have you been able to sleep?
@24SteveTaylor I don't even put it down...
@Crypto_bag hope so!
@growthharbor I see it too...think it will happen?
@CryptosQueen Hit? How do. A lot of them went up. Just the market.
@R_ieso @6BillionPeople I will keep my finger crossed for all of us
@steve_simmo88 You were my friend
@6BillionPeople @R_ieso 2 mins? It‚Äôs been going down since 10am
@Social_Crypto Haha ok. Literally watching that graph turn red
@6BillionPeople It‚Äôs so hard to hold
@Social_Crypto I‚Äôm trying
@GaziAkyuzDene Scary stuff
@CryptosQueen you just deleted all your predictions and graphs...
@CryptosQueen That's a big dip...
@WintrowJames @CryptosQueen Scared the crap out of me
@goodolefella @CryptosQueen what just happened!
@CryptosQueen seriously....just been sitting here like üíªüíªüëÄüëÄüëÄ
@CryptosQueen Does this mean I have time to eat dinner?
@CryptosQueen @Feezy_F looks like a correction
@DreamAssembler Take a bath!!!!!
@conflictedbg Ditto
@DreamAssembler Keep showering
@CryptosQueen I‚Äôm holding on for dear life. What a crazy ride this has been

@PhilipMooney yes, keyword!
I'm a little bummed to see my favorite race happening @TourDeBeauce . I love that race. It almost makes me want to race again!
So pumped to see @andrewtalansky riding so well. Keep it up!
@tejay_van No worries Tejay. Just show your form the next few days!
@timjohnsoncx Break is going to get caught...Too many good guys left in the field #USPRO
I just pre-ordered @ITSTHENERVE . Can't wait to see if it works!

@ChristianVDV @PaulSherwen @PhilLiggett toms for the win- sky rider salty
@ChristianVDV @PaulSherwen @PhilLiggett Ha, funny.
@ChristianVDV @PaulSherwen @PhilLiggett I also think the field will split on that flat section
@ChristianVDV @PaulSherwen @PhilLiggett The break stays...Teams won't be strong enough to bring it back at altitude.
Way to go Pete! Was great watching you @peterstetina

@stmarysca I don't understand why this isn't a "non-smoking campus?"
@ivandominguez07 ya there are sharks in there!
@DBouchardHall not sure if you remember that interview I did with you on aerodynamics 15 years ago?
@ivandominguez07 Otherwise I will sink. Kind of scary when you look down and there's 100 feet of water below you. Got to finish now!
Finally I'm able to angle my aero bar extensions upward without getting in trouble. No UCI Rules! #noUCIrules #triathlete #prayingMantis
@ivandominguez07 so how are we supposed to swim and run?

@outsidemagazine Interesting, but it doesn't really say anything in the article. Just a hypothesis.
@frankpipp pretty much. Maybe you can teach me how to run?

@a1yssad , and
I guess it's official. Signed up for @IRONMANtri #IM703santacruz . Less then a month to prepare. #wishmeluck #justkeepswimming #dontdrowned

@Gingerkowski the drink?
@tawneeprazak what about having @doctorinigo on the show. A different perspective. Works with top athletes
@EndurancePlanet @DrPhilMaffetone @ProfTimNoakes What about muscle fasciculation? Any idea if it's linked to hydration? @tawneeprazak
@magnusgille Dropped immediately
Saw someone warming up with a altitude mask yesterday for a cat 5 crit:I said to myself either he is going to win or get dropped immediatley
@tawneeprazak @EndurancePlanet @osmohydration Tawnee, meet Stacy @summerstack . Stacy, meet Tawnee @tawneeprazak
@rusty_woods So awesome to see you doing so well. More good things to come!
@timjohnsoncx @TourTracker raw
@TourTracker you should do in race interviews with riders after the break goes...Would be cool @timjohnsoncx
@TourofUtah @AFCU Vote for @peterstetina for most inspiring comeback! 4 Months out and still racing on one leg!
@EndurancePlanet @tawneeprazak when are you going to get Stacy Sims on the show? @osmohydration
@ajeeckman @BigBlueAdventur if only I could swim and run as fast as you, I'd be all set!
@bambula ya but a stage win on the line!!!! Even if you're in yellow you still want stages. Payment bonuses. Quintana would have won.robbed
@bambula why else would he have attacked right when he saw it? Only way he knew he could get away
@bambula which is the only reason he was able to get a gap because no one else wanted to be called out
@bambula no way, all the guys saw it and waited. If Alberto had the legs he would have waited for 2 seconds. Nibali saw it
@andrewtalansky top ten tomorrow!
@bambula the problem was it was the only way he could get away. No one chased him because they had to wait. Only reason he won the stage
@philmaertens So you're saying that Luca was just stupid?
@philmaertens really? Why is that?
@philmaertens Since when is cocaine not a performance enhancing drug? Obviously you're communication management steered clear of wrongdoing
@BigBlueAdventur I will be racing Donner Lake Triathlon. Hopefully I don't drown.
If I were @tonymartin85 I'd be so pissed at @MarkCavendish . I agree with @bobkeroll
@Laura_Weislo hmmm that sounds incorrect...
#TDF pick - @vincenzonibali first, @NairoQuinCo second, @ThibautPinot third.
@HISTORY put me on your #aloneshow ... These guys giving up in 1,2,3,4 days? Seriously?
@CurtPMills @nslckevin @VeloPromo1 then juniors wouldn't race for 35$ entry, more juniors would race possibly,u23s wouldn't pay 100$ Per
@Laura_Weislo @Cyclingnewsfeed @velonews That's too bad...I guess people just want to read the latest on gossip.
@nslckevin @VeloPromo1 I want to re-examine this now that registration is $45 - t-shirts 900? officials $350 per day? Surcharges 2600?
@Laura_Weislo @velonews @Cyclingnewsfeed I did see that but it's in an article titled news shorts- I would expect much more.
so @velonews @Cyclingnewsfeed write articles about Horner doing Utah but write nothing about U23 and amateur nationals...
@BarbaraCorcoran Yes because I'm sure at that point if it didn't work out you were still ok. A little different than those who can't risk it
@jncrowson @usacycling @Cyclingnewsfeed I'm sure it's not about the weather conditions but about how poorly the race was organized #RoadNats
@usacycling my first national championships was 13-14 in Pennsylvania. I still remember the last lap of the crit.
@HISTORY you call these guys on the show "Alone" experienced? Wouldn't they last forever if they were? Seems staged to me
@CPbike probably a lot of other things to worry about first. What about leg hair/stubble/clean shave? Facial hair?
@CPbike uh really?
Love @Dlee042 attitude. Something a lot of young guys should look up to.  http://t.co/1H3aNXZJW3
@LarryBeilABC7 @abc7newsBayArea ya @Dlee042 !
@warriors keep @Dlee042 in the game!
@andrewtalansky @theJesseMoore just a breakpoint ride  #USPRO
@velonews with all this reporting, you'd think there were only two guys in the race
@Laura_Weislo backside of Hamilton is much harder then the front from San Jose. It will shatter
@TheDPate @Laura_Weislo ya not sure where that came from...
@TheDPate @AmgenTOC and allow more teams
@stmarysca would love to but very expensive for 1 class
@robertherjavec Great quote, "Be great at one thing, don't try to be great at multiple things"
@theJesseMoore aren't you the one who always told me one day at a time?
@DICKS your price match guarantee is only for direct comp. not for local retailers. Why is it labeled wrong on website?
@bambula @ammattipyoraily It doesn't matter if he's clean now...still will have an advantage.
@its_cleanuptime certainly.
@its_cleanuptime @joepabike @matthewlcooke @RetardRaceRadio All this information is so disappointing.
@rexchapman never heard a more biased called game. Are you an announcer or a fan?
@LastManFOX I will, but only if I can be an extra.... HAHA ;)
Watching @LastManFOX makes me miss Tucson!
I knew it all along!  http://t.co/xejYqfhmRF
Clean riders have peaks and valleys, have to recover, and cannot continuously train, that's why doping leads to more then a 5-7% increase.
What I think this CIRC report missed was that micro-dosing and tracking/matching bio passport allows riders to maintain fitness. No valleys
I have so much empathy for obesity. I can't imagine how hard it is to break the cycle. @brucepitcher @ABC_ChrisPowell #600lblife
Interested to see this CIRC report from @BrianCooksonUCI and if it actually shows the real problems in cycling. http://t.co/wZlIipB20Z
@FredrikKess about management; something that is rarely brought up in cycling. Rather, everyone talks about doping. http://t.co/NXFKDDIGSO

Regardless, this in not the way the rule is described in uci rulebook and gives huge advantage to anyone riding electronic @redlandsclassic
@nslckevin @redlandsclassic 10cm from bottom of elbowpad to top of shifter in line with the bar upward, they will "imaginary" measure upward
This gives a huge advantage to anyone who is riding electronic shifting.
The 10 cm from pad rule enforced to top of mechanical shifter @redlandsclassic . Regardless if you have return2center shifter.
Make sure to get your bikes checked for Redlands, the officials have gone back and forth and are now measuring to top of mechanical shifter

@vandap was rooting for you!
I don't get why they say "The Americans" at #AmericasCup ? I'm pretty sure it's NZL vs. NZL
Just learned about "apparent wind" from #americascup . Interesting. So basically I'm always riding in a headwind...
@A_Biscardi likewise. Nice job!
@CPbike you were moving!
I'm pretty sure @CPbike wasn't worried as much about winning today as he was about getting the @Strava record.
@FacciFoodCo tried some this morning. I will have to get some more! #FarmersMarket #Yoatz #naturalfood #fall
Happy to support great products and companies like @ISMsaddles . Will definitely be seeing more of them on the road next year!
@butterflywriter next time!
@frankpipp don't mess with me, man...
Had such a great time racing with @BissellCycling the past few months. Great teammates and staff. Thanks guys.
Glad I got to be teammates with @frankpipp . One of the best guys, and tomorrow, his last day, I'm all in for him to win. @BissellCycling
Mrs. Doubtfire is on. One of he best movies ever. So funny I can barely watch it. They don't make them like they used to.
That was probably the fastest 98 miles I've ever done, 3:22. We were just cruising all day. Happy to move on to the next stages.
I'm glad to have my Attack Saddle racing on these bumpy Canadian roads @ISMsaddles @fastfreddie1973 #ismnation
@bayareabikes not sure I understand the point of the bridge bike path?
@Matveika hope I live that long!
@gasperak really? What a waste of money
I don't get the Bay Bridge Bike Path. It goes no where. Just half way on the bridge, then ends?
Had a great time racing @USAProChallenge and am super excited to race @TourOfAlberta with @BissellCycling after a week at home.
I don't think @philgaimon is talking about cookies when he says how much he loves Schnoodledoodles
Thank you for cheering for me out on the road today. It was awesome. Miss Colorado!
@NCNCA true.
@NCNCA I will donate all my velo promo race winnings to junior registration pot.
@NCNCA I don't claim to be a promoter, but would like to see juniors not pay as much as pros and masters for registration fee
Not a fan of Velo Promo races. They don't support junior development and are too expensive/ tshirt to win. But to race in @NCNCA you have to

Childhood obesity doesn't come from school's hot lunch, it is 100 percent to blame on parents.
