Vilsack has as about much in common with Democratic voters at this point as I do with Dabo Swinney‚Äôs sweatshirt tonight.
I‚Äôll never understand the argument ‚Äî from Dems or Republicans ‚Äî that voters need to nominate a boring/cautious/pragmatic candidate to win. It‚Äôs such a lame, paralyzed Washington way of thinking that ignores how voters actually think.

@AlecMacGillis Was just chatting about this -- Slightly more rural folks in Ohio, slightly more college-educated folks in Wisconsin. Walker was a known bogeyman for Dems. DeWine has, like, decades of name ID. But I think you're right -- feels more like Indiana than Pennsylvania today.

lotta clunky voting machines in some of those KY-6 counties -- taking people a while to vote, it will take a while to count those votes, too

Remember Virginia last year -- Polls had Northam up by 3 on Election Day. He won by 9, a bigger polling miss than anything in 2016. Why? Northam's pollster Geoff Garin said they didn't account enough for new voters.

@ragley @hboydbrown @CoachHuggs That team broke my heart. RIP Kenyon‚Äôs leg.
Anyway, @CoachHuggs, you‚Äôre a legend and one of the greatest coaches of all-time. Thank you ‚Äî and thank you, Twitter, for following me on his brief but wondrous tour of Bob Huggins fashion history. (1,024/1,024) https://t.co/nYZJrT2Mhz
This was an unfortunate speed bump, though. https://t.co/63WBAUU5kT
He‚Äôs taken some risks, to be sure. The gold suit was iconic. But too much for Morgantown. This isn‚Äôt Atlantic City. (please note the cuffs here) https://t.co/8cJ8ht49kh
You could go swimming in that thing. Look at it! Incredible. Just incredible. https://t.co/0cJjWki6Ou
When Huggins finally came home to West Virginia, it seemed like he truly felt at home in his wardrobe too. You get to a certain age and stature and you don‚Äôt really care anymore. But that‚Äôs when genius happens. Here‚Äôs where the short sleeve windbreaker becomes his signature look. https://t.co/pf0Cjafjms
Gonna re-up this pic because of the pants. Take a gander there. https://t.co/nJGmnn5FCC
After Huggins left Cincinnati (still hate you, Nancy Zimpher), things got a little weird for two years at Kansas State. It was like the third Strokes album. Didn‚Äôt make sense. Also purple is not a great color for Bob. https://t.co/awL5y1FCLD
Bob seemed to like the roomy feel of these tops and stopped wearing jackets. This is where the pullover and windbreaker looks start to emerge. Huggins was wearing a pullover, in fact, during one of his all-time greatest wins ‚Äî over Duke in the ‚Äò98 Great Alaska Shootout. https://t.co/egGnLerOnX
Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. He largely abandoned the dress shirt as Cincinnati emerged as a perennial top 25 contender in the mid to late 90s. We still saw a suit jacket, yes, but accompanied by turtlenecks and button up sweaters. https://t.co/64e71pAOAw
Huggins‚Äô legendary career at Cincinnati marked the beginning of his groundbreaking work in the fashion space. You‚Äôll see here he started out with the suits, even dabbling for a time with a boxy three-piece, again with wide lapels. Every detail finely tuned. https://t.co/CtwTdhMZLt
Huggins then coached at Akron (go Zips!) and opted for trimmer lines and a fairly conventional 80s flow. Cool vintage photo, but an unremarkable look. https://t.co/ThEjB5pLao
But his dramatic fashion journey began humbly. Here is Bob with some very wide lapels and a fantastic bowl cut in the early 80s, when he coached at Walsh College in Ohio. His first gig. https://t.co/mzGUunjPvD
Huggs appears to have settled into this look as his preferred offseason vibe. Here he is celebrating @vanexel31‚Äôs induction into the Cincinnati Bearcats Hall of Fame in September. I imagine he has 8-10 of these shirts in his closet at the moment. Look at the smile. https://t.co/eydWYTq9IP
As the world‚Äôs biggest fan of @CoachHuggs, I have some important context to provide for all of you tonight about his outfit choice in the Joe Manchin ad. This man is a fashion icon and he deserves his moment in the spotlight ... https://t.co/qYQOWEv4RE

People are focused on the Trump-Warren combat, but the racial dynamics of the nascent Dem primary are also fascinating. @Bakari_Sellers was blunt, calling Warren's DNA gambit "ignorant" and "selfish" https://t.co/1nv5pXplGk

Cost of Senate Majority PAC's ad spend this week to save Bob Menendez: $353,793 on cable, $707K on network (NYC &amp; Philly markets). $1 million/week in a race Dems might blow b/c they protected a terrible candidate. Maybe the angry-at-Beto crowd should be more upset with Menendez?

@johnwhuey Landrieu 2020!
We are witnessing a political case study unfold in real time. Everyone in Washington should be paying attention. All because of #ParklandStrong
What‚Äôs funny is that this native language of the internet is actually our real life language too. The political establishment, so long contemptuous of this younger generation and the digital world generally, still thinks we live offline lives and online lives. They are the same.
What America is finally understanding is that young people, teens especially, talk through pictures. Images are the vernacular. They‚Äôre so good at this because it‚Äôs how they‚Äôve been communicating most of their lives. https://t.co/b4IffMj8SO

Maybe it‚Äôs not a secret but the GOP base is just as fired up as the Dems these days. Not for Gillespie, but for Trump. Still big factor.
Things to keep an eye on: Northam relying on outside groups for field &amp; digital. Gillespie doing everything in house &amp; v focused on digital

@BelferCenter @jwherrman To wit: Sources of social media attention around Clinton Foundation news last August 1) Judicial Watch 2) Breitbart 3) New York Times https://t.co/gxSWpNxBGW
@BelferCenter @jwherrman These are things we kinda/sorta knew - but great to see backed up by research and data points
@BelferCenter @jwherrman The rest of the DC/NY political media world is deaf to these enormous changes in the ecosystem. Still watching cable/perusing Twitter
@BelferCenter @jwherrman Partisan right wing media is noisier and as powerful as the mainstream press - and doesn't play by the same rules at all
Everyone in politics needs to read this @BelferCenter study about media asymmetry in 2016 https://t.co/A51MOj5PeE h/t @jwherrman https://t.co/gmzOlOlvNC
and this is a city that's had a fairly open dialogue about the Confederate memorials in public spaces https://t.co/z9Lwv3kBqS
In a city like Richmond, "Nazis are bad" is not as clean cut as "these statues are bad" -- tricky turf for Dems to play on
A week ago, consensus in Richmond was leave statues up, add context. Now for Dems, it's moved 180 degrees in other direction - in 5 days!
Virginia Gov race will be testing ground for this. VA is not hospitable for Trump, but statue issue moves political debate in new direction https://t.co/1TOFJIhSPS

@jaredsmall It's remarkable to me how undercovered digital politics is right now. central to how Americans receive news and how trump won. No one cares.
@daveweigel same take: Dems have a clear enthusiasm advantage. Ralph should be fine. but Ds have had scary close-calls in 2 consecutive statewides
@mkady i made a thread!
Yes, Gillespie in a very tough spot. But man, Dems are awesome at complacency.
also Dems are laughably under-utilizing digital in down-ballot races. Rs fixed that problem; dominated non-presidential digital spend in '16
is the D base fully with Northam? Looks like they're with Ed, despite close call with Corey Stewart
Virginia Rs outperform on E-day. Cuccinelli '13 &amp; Gillespie '14 should have been huge warning signs for 2016 about polls and "hidden" voters
Libertarians in recent statewides have never lived up to their poll numbers on election day
