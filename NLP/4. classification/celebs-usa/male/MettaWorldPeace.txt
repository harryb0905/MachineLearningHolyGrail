It would be really cool if the young generation such as Famous Dex , lil yachty , LeekyBandz and more pay homage to the guys like Al Sharpton and more who dedicated their lives to our communities. It was not perfect, but these guys tried hard to keep us alive when others did not
I think it‚Äôs important to build your own communities. We now need less athletes and entertainers and more economists and architects so we can build and uncover our lost culture .
It‚Äôs really cool to see guys and girls like lebron, queen b, lonzo ball etc on the way to becoming future billionaires..   This generation is very cool. Not just because of the money , but how they dug the culture out of a hole.   I‚Äôm looking forward to the next level .

I‚Äôm changing Basketball rules . If you foul someone, all you have to do is say sorry and give the player a hug, and they don‚Äôt get to shoot free throws because of good sportsmanship . If the opponent refuses the hug, a technical foul will get called on the refuser
Can we finally mention @JHarden13 and @KDTrey5 in the same conversations as @KingJames @kobebryant @Jumpman23 ?  Hit me on https://t.co/BMSTeen1uA to discuss.. I‚Äôm very interested to know their is no mention.
If I wanted to , I could be top 5 rappers in 2018. I have lots of time now to record.. lol.
Just one more joke.
The @memgrizz was singing 99bottles of Bear on the wall , then the @hornets took 30 of their bottles
@JHarden13 mvp
Sometimes I throw rocks at hard places and things happen. #luck
There was no diversity in the @hornets vs @memgrizz score. It was very one sided. #wewantjobs
They @memgrizz vs @hornets score differentiation was the amount of games I got suspended for in 2004/005
The @hornets vs @memgrizz score looks like my friends blood pressure
@michellethi24 Come watch me play . No need to wait .. we ball in the parks
I like the @NBA Of today. It‚Äôs very fun. It‚Äôs hard to say who I would or would not lock up.. but I do dream about playing against some of these really good players in my prime. I‚Äôm definitely going to watch some @NBA games on the road.
My favorite part of my career was the adversity.. sometimes what doesn‚Äôt kill you , makes you stronger. And sometimes you die , but die trying.  That‚Äôs what I miss about playing. I miss not being able to count on my body , and only count on my mind
I could definitely be a great 8th man in the playoffs..   I could probably put up 13 a night on a playoff team.   19 a night on a bad team...
