Not everyone that seeks to be a comedian is a natural writer some of you are performers &amp; will need to dig deep, be creative &amp; find new ways to deliver the message. It can be political, absurdist, set up punchline or improvisation.  Writing takes time to master. Patience.

SUNDAY: 48 utensils surrounding a skyscraper of plates so high it looks like any moment Ratatouille is gonna hop up there &amp; sing a ditty called ‚ÄòLove‚Äôs Sinking In.‚Äô
SATURDAY: Tupperware with fragments of stale perishables left floating in it like arctic ice shelves.  1 bottle opener hiding (probably giggling) inside the disposal.
FRIDAY: 3 lipstick stained wine glasses.  1 petrified sponge that looks like it has stage 4 cancer.
THURSDAY: 1 upside down soda can.  1 sharp knife that fell into the day 1 plastic cup blade up &amp; camouflaged by soapy water.
WEDNESDAY: 2 cereal bowls filled with water and the milk you didn‚Äôt pour out, leaving it appearing like a murky dead eye in a witches cauldron.
TUESDAY: 2 plates with a sprinkle of crumbs as well as a hardened jam or ketchup glob.
MONDAY: 1 relatively clean blue plastic cup with a tiny crack in it that you‚Äôve had for 15 years.
