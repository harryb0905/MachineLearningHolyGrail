More than two years into Donald Trump’s presidency, Senate Democrats continue to abuse the Senate confirmation process and delay well-qualified nominees. I support a Senate rules change that would break this legislative logjam.

Our country has made great strides toward equality because of leaders such as John Lewis and Medgar Evers, and we have improved educational opportunities for all Americans.

I am proud to have worked with @POTUS to strengthen our economy. Please take a moment to read my most recent opinion piece.
.@POTUS invited Roy James from Vicksburg to be one of his guests for his State of the Union address. The President's speech highlighted the many accomplishments made by Republicans in Washington.
I look forward to representing the interests of Mississippians as these important discussions continue.
As the Commerce Committee considers ways to enhance 5G expansion in the United States, I am mindful of the many challenges facing the deployment of this new technology including regulatory hurdles, international competition, and data privacy and security concerns.

I am confident we can continue to work together in the best interest of the American people and to further strengthen our union.” - RW #SOTU #SOTU2019 #SOTU19
.@POTUS has backed up his rhetoric by showing his willingness to negotiate in good faith. In a divided government, Congress will have to do the same to overcome our disagreements. #SOTU #SOTU2019 #SOTU19
There is bipartisan support for @POTUS's appeal to improve America’s infrastructure. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, this goal is among my top priorities. #SOTU #SOTU2019 #SOTU19
I am glad @POTUS pointed to our shared successes and opportunities. Our economy continues to surge, wages are increasing, and unemployment is low. We are taking better care of our veterans and rebuilding our military. #SOTU #SOTU2019 #SOTU19
"@POTUS @realDonaldTrump was right to call for national unity and bipartisan cooperation to tackle our greatest challenges. Resistance, obstruction, and division foster weakness and decline – not greatness. #SOTU #SOTU2019 #SOTU19
A return to bipartisan support for enhanced border security would go a long way toward improving our politics &amp; protecting our nation.
Given the effectiveness of the walls currently in place, it is unfortunate @POTUS's request for additional walls &amp; security has sparked such a partisan divide.

I proudly cast a vote for Judge Kavanaugh. I am confident he will be a fair-minded and honest addition to the Supreme Court.” - RW
I am thankful their smear tactics were not successful and that the rule of law and due process have prevailed over obstruction and divisive political tactics.
This process revealed what we have known from the beginning: Judge Kavanaugh is highly-qualified, and Senate Democrats were willing to go to any lengths to prevent this nomination from moving forward.
“Judge Kavanaugh has been subjected to the most rigorous confirmation process in the history of the Supreme Court.
I know firsthand the importance of military service and will continue to ensure that we have a strong military and respect our servicemembers. #MSSen #Mississippi https://t.co/KLRXkh0CR8

If you haven't heard already, President Trump's Make American Great Again rally in Jackson has been canceled due to Hurricane Florence. We agree with this decision as nothing is more important than the safety of our fellow Americans.
It is a day I will never forget. Where were you on September 11, 2001?

For example, over 90 percent of this year’s graduating seniors who participated in a JROTC program within the Jackson Public School system have been accepted into an institution of higher learning.
Earlier this year I introduced the JROTC Act in the U.S. Senate. The bill authorizes funding for 100 additional JROTC units and makes reforms that would help schools in rural and underserved areas participate. JROTC has a record of positive outcomes.

I am nevertheless pleased this nomination has been confirmed, and I am confident Mike Pompeo will serve our nation well as our top diplomat.” - RW
It is unfortunate so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle chose to ignore a long-standing tradition of strong bipartisan support for qualified nominees for secretary of state.
.@POTUS has confidence in the secretary-designate, and he deserves a national security team he trusts to carry out his agenda.
“As the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, a former member of Congress, a West Point graduate at the top of his class, and an editor of the Harvard Law Review, no one can dispute Mike Pompeo’s qualifications to serve as our next secretary of state.

Our economy is picking up steam thanks to fewer regulations &amp; lower taxes: - 200,000 net new positions - the unemployment rate stayed at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent - hourly wages rose 0.3 percent from the prior month to $26.74 - worker pay up 2.9 percent compared to 1/17
According to Democrats that is a terrible thing and must be stopped immediately.
Because of the historic tax cut, millions of Americans are keeping more of their hard-earned money, companies are investing billions in America, and new jobs are being created.
Once again Democrats are showing they don't care about the well-being of average Americans.  https://t.co/YqMo0wgtP6
