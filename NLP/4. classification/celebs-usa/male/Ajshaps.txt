@markwonderful @LizClaman lol standard FOX BUSINESS issue
@David26175 absolutely...
@David26175 and the rest of the country  we have obligation to our public eployees and it is not being met with pending dire consequences
@David26175 We posted the entire interview with CalPERS as well as retirees on the web page.  Only Agenda is informing California residents
@David26175 other CA cities and towns will have to come up with more money as discount rate is lowered... budgets already stressed
@David26175 its own staff recommendations to cut discount rate to 6.4% so the "lie" continues CalPERS overestimates investment return
@David26175 the funding models public pensions have used for decades which mislead retirees, municipalities and taxpayers.  CalPERS ignored
@David26175 Nope.  Meeting the people is key to connecting.  As for the reasons, it gets to the funding issues public pensions
@Shortrosen yes... very troubling
FOX Business has a great 2016 https://t.co/qIgEijPzqi
@David26175 and the article you link to pulls information and quotes from the original FOX Business article
@David26175 again not sure what you mean by lie?  I will follow you and please direct message me.  Accuracy is always key.
@David26175 we also pointed out that Loyalton was only 40 percent funded even though it had done what CalPERS told it to do
w@David26175 We reported that Loyalton pulled out of the fund but had made all of its payments in full up to that point
@David26175 @snopes please explain.   We did not lie
@Shortrosen nope but it poses s problem in the future for sellers
@markwonderful Lol may I quote you?
