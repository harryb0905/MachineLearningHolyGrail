@garycstuckey @Michmart27 @realDonaldTrump Not if I only lose people who can‚Äôt take an opinion.
@jayrick321 @realDonaldTrump Yup. I‚Äôm crying. I‚Äôm rich. And his policies can make me richer and still I hate him being my president. Crying through it though. Thanks for the follow.
Going to bed. Thank you for the conversation we started. This is what it‚Äôs all about! People sharing different opinions
@Michmart27 @realDonaldTrump On stage I‚Äôm a celebrity. On Twitter I‚Äôm just saying how i feel. Shouldn‚Äôt matter. Just how I feel
@rhuff16947 @lilsiskirk @DrDanStantz @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt want fans that can‚Äôt take an opinion. Hope you can stay for the music.
@roonie742 You‚Äôre right.
To be clear. I think @realDonaldTrump is cancer and bad for our country.
@rcllive I hear you. And respectfully I don‚Äôt think trump really answered. But we can disagree
@JamesGarFig you're not wrong james.
@519devyn Literally. Not one.
@amddrafting @ThomPettit @MarilynWeaver13 @YankeeRunnerLV @Acosta I want journalists to debate my president way way more.
@JamesKankula I appreciate that. mari and I were arguing about it. even thought the guy in the white house is also one of her good friends too, she refuses to talk any politics with him
@KathR72164 he was trying to move on because he didn't want to answer the question. as a president that shouldn't be an option in a press conference.
@Pennywize992000 thank you Eva.
@JENNRAES23 @GillPill77 can you hear him say "excuse me mam" as she ripped the mic from his hand.
and if you follow me HAVE YOU FOLLOWED ME? I have been a supporter of gay and trans rights since before you have heard of me. super vocally. and my wife is a beautiful brown woman. so DON'T play the cis white card with me
it's not always that black &amp; white. my friends in the white house vehemently disagree with any of Trumps's social policies but have things about his other policies that may directly impact their communities. it's a thing. the world can be grey. except that trump is an idiot. B&amp;W
@ksandra91 it's not always that black &amp; white. my friends in the white house vehemently disagree with any of Trumps's social policies but have things about his other policies that may directly impact their communities. it's a thing. the world can be grey. except that trump is an idiot. B&amp;W
@SRG7409 yeah. I don't like him either and i'm STILL waiting for a reason too.
@MeauxMckenzie @MarilynWeaver13 calling anyone who would suppress the freedom of the press a minion regardless of gender? yes.
funny thing is, so many of my friends are super far right. one actually works in the white house. so if me and my friends can get along i'm pretty sure we all can too. let's not let a level of discourse make us different people
@CryptoBeagle1 please do. I have an opinion to share but I don't think we are people who can't be friends. so many of my friends are super far right.
@SRG7409 respectfully as well. üòâ
@SRG7409 to be fair, Hume had made a lot of sexist remarks about Clinton as a female that he wouldn't have made to a male. and yes. I think she handled it as "upset" not "unhinged". For obama it wasn't a press conference at the white house and a reporter it was a speech and a heckler.
@amddrafting @MarilynWeaver13 @YankeeRunnerLV many FOX news journalists? because the majority of the press corps supported Jim. also I support @Acosta and all real journalists. left and right.
ok. guys. been fun. as a blanket statement. I don't unfollow people with different opinions that aren't mean. if you do that's ok. but would be better if this was a place we could share our discourse. up to you, of course.
@ccuchens I expect that from someone I guess. or you can just respect I don't agree with you. i'm cool with that. if you're not then your unfollow is welcomed.
@cheteasterwood @MarilynWeaver13 didn't mean that as mean. sounded that way. twitter and all. I appreciate your views. üôÇüôÇ
@cheteasterwood @MarilynWeaver13 the only outrage is that more people from the press don't "press" him on actual issues when they speak to him face to face. it's amazing to see how he responds to it.
@CryptoBeagle1 i'm 46. i'm a father. a (hella) taxpayer. and an american. if it's cool with you, i'll do what I like and say what I like. no matter what my job. ok?
@madlaw1071 another OPINION piece. that only shows the level that most presidents go. democrat and republican alike. this is different. it's not anti republican. just anti trumps recent actions. check when I tweeted and he was elected. I said "don't hate. let's see"
@madlaw1071 because it's the only major news network that has actually admitted that the majority of their programming is entertainment and opinion and not news. I actually feel sorry for how little you know. good luck out there.
@sranalli look at the source. shill.
oh yes. of course @mattymay is always with me. I won't let him leave. even if he wanted to. also, @Twitter let's get @mattymay verified? he is one of a kind.
@PensKillTheCaps @madlaw1071 I appreciate that. thanks for being an actual person. much love and I respect your disagreement and will fight for that too.
@YankeeRunnerLV and he wasn't a reporter. he was a heckler at a speech. it is not the same.
@YankeeRunnerLV this was a white house press reporter in the press room. he wasn't yelling he was asking a question. if you can't see the difference you aren't talking about free speech.
@madlaw1071 it's how I refer to anyone of any gender who suppresses the freedom of press at the behest of her boss.
on a lighter musical note, @FrankRomano1 @FogleAbe and @aliasboogie will be joining me starting at @BorgataAC in January to kick off a year of playing some music together!
i'm 46 years old. in my lifetime i've never seen a world leader command one of his minions to take a mic out of a reporter's hands because he was questioning him. I only IMAGINED that kind of thing happened in North Korea, the Philippines, or anywhere a dictator was in charge.

@vickizenier @MiddleAmerica5 @LymeAlliance It is more than possible. Mari suffered for years before being diagnosed properly. Since she also has autoimmune disease it made it even more difficult. Plz ck @LymeAlliance site to find a Lyme literate doc that can help you get the testing you need. Most regular docs can't help
song of the day: TOUCH - SWEET SPIRIT @sweetspiritband https://t.co/3cRRW4YbXz
@vickizenier @MiddleAmerica5 @LymeAlliance Mari said to please let you know that many docs don‚Äôt have proper testing. And they keep using the old unreliable ones. It‚Äôs important that you find a lyme literate doctor and get better testing done. @LymeAlliance website offers some good resources.
@vickizenier @MiddleAmerica5 @LymeAlliance Yes it can be false negative results. Sadly testing is very flawed. Mari tested negative quite a few times before finally testing positive for several tick borne diseases.
@MiddleAmerica5 @LymeAlliance @vickizenier I think that YOU are actually spreading dangerous and harmful information on my twitter site. MANY people suffering from tick borne disease continue to test negative for many years until properly getting diagnosed. My wife included. Your daughter was lucky. But not everyone is.

Ok. You guys are having a healthy discussion. See you tomorrow
@mikebara33 @wastintime_41 #BLM comes from the oppressed. the alt right is about continuing that oppression. I'm with you. But not here.
@RheeTweet3 @wastintime_41 It's not right and left anymore. It's do you hate or don't you. My friends in the hard right hate these people. I won't let it be that
@wastintime_41 Great point. Many of my friends are super right NONE of them are these racists pricks. I DONT equate right with racist.
@mikebara33 @wastintime_41 You may be right. Hope you're on the right one.
@mikebara33 @wastintime_41 So a group that says that a race shouldn't exist gets the same space as the people they are oppressing? Can't
@RheeTweet3 @wastintime_41 I'm dead aware. Stay with the ideals that the party began with. Better yet, find a center in your heart and not party loyalty. What is right
@mikebara33 @wastintime_41 You are on the wrong side of history my friend.
@mikebara33 @wastintime_41 I support that totally. Free speech doesn't mean you can't be confronted for your actions.
@mikebara33 No. Funny how a peaceful protest with #BlackLivesMatter gets major resistance and #charlotesville had almost no police presence
@wastintime_41 Me too timefor the right to step up and condemn this hate being spread in their name. Don't spread it.
@wastintime_41 And both about civil rights. Be on the right side my friend
Never forget. The "alt right" are terrorists. We had a war to prove that you can't be a nazi AND a proud American. We won.
