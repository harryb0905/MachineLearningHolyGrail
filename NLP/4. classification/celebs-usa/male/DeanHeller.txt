My sincere congratulations again to Jacky Rosen, my hat‚Äôs off to the hard work her team put into this race. The transition will be easy as our teams work together for the future of our great state.
You made calls, knocked doors, contributed to keep our ads on the air, and helped us fight the outrageous smears and attacks. Thank you for all you have done. YOU are the reason ours is the biggest and strongest ground game in Nevada history. Our victory will be because of you. https://t.co/Bd0Q86SHXz

"Rosen‚Äôs campaign did not respond to a call and email for comment."  Sounds about right considering Democrat Jacky Rosen raises more money from California than Nevada, dodges debates, and hides from voters beyond her campaign office. https://t.co/xB0ndCLW9a
Once again, Democrat Jacky Rosen can't get the support she needs from Nevadans so "California 2020" (a progressive PAC) is running ads to help BUY her the seat.   Hilarious. https://t.co/QevGLuITxQ
Democrat mega donors have a clear agenda: BUY the Nevada U.S. Senate seat so it's out of Nevadans' hands, and into those that "know better" than we do...   Not going to happen on my watch.   https://t.co/xB0ndCLW9a #NVSen
Reminder: @RosenforNevada had a press conference calling for the repeal of your tax cut.   Obviously, that would be really bad for #Nevada families. https://t.co/6npNieKYWZ

Today we announced our veterans‚Äô coalition. I thank them for their service and for joining our team. #NVSen https://t.co/sqSzLlVQfm
I am honored and humbled to have these heroes on our veterans‚Äô coalition. I won‚Äôt stop fighting to get them the benefits they‚Äôve earned. #NVSen https://t.co/sqSzLlVQfm
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when the experts and media mocked President Trump‚Äôs goal of hitting 3% annual economic growth as a ‚Äúpipe dream.‚Äù We‚Äôre on track to do just that in 2018.

Amazing GDP numbers this morning. Hey @RosenforNevada, how great have these tax cuts been for our economy? https://t.co/rNmNy78jSf
Humbled to receive the Nevada Law Enforcement Coalition‚Äôs endorsement. I‚Äôll continue to stand up for the men &amp; women in Nevada who put themselves in harm‚Äôs way to keep our communities safe. #NVSen https://t.co/BQFDQUfU7B https://t.co/p0gIIgAWU2

If it were up to Jacky Rosen, Nevada would turn into a nuclear waste dump. #fail

I will never turn my back on our nation‚Äôs military heroes. Generation after generation these men and women fought ‚Äì and sacrificed ‚Äì for us.
#TaxReform is working:  ‚úìWages are up. ‚úì Unemployment is down. ‚úì Consumer confidence is up. ‚úì The economy is making a comeback.
Our bravest heroes shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer poor or untimely care due to inefficiencies in government. #VeteransFirst

This is great news for Nevada, and with #TaxReform, I‚Äôm looking forward to more economic growth. https://t.co/zID8iajqly #NVSen
.@RosenforNevada clearly values the radical positions of her liberal California allies more than hard working families across Nevada. https://t.co/zYnBbv8lj9 #NVSen
Your tax cut is worth the fights and attacks. I won‚Äôt and haven‚Äôt stopped there, because Nevadans deserve more.
@RosenforNevada chose shooting a television ad for her campaign over standing up for Nevada veterans. Priorities matter. https://t.co/HQcdBmp8pY #NVSen
Yesterday was a big day for @RosenforNevada. She voted with Nancy Pelosi for the 800th time. #NVSen https://t.co/z5qXj3IGtV
One week after it was uncovered that @RosenforNevada lied that she ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô a business she still hasn‚Äôt personally said anything about the scandal‚Ä¶instead leaving her campaign staff to salvage the sinking ship. https://t.co/u7Nr01aKuQ #NVSen
My Amendment that doubled the child tax credit is going to give much-needed and overdue relief to thousands of Nevada families. https://t.co/2AFPhlGd44
As a result of our fight, the #VA‚Äôs backlog of disability claims has been reduced by 85% and over five hundred thousand veterans‚Äô claims have been resolved.
.@RosenforNevada lied about building a business.  She made.  It.  Up.   It‚Äôs time for her to come out of hiding and answer Nevadans‚Äô lingering questions about this scandal. #NVSen https://t.co/xiOvOMUPZZ

We have to prevent the Constitution from becoming fleetingly ever-changing &amp; meaningless. I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting President Trump‚Äôs nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. We need a Justice who will uphold the Constitution - not re-write it.
You can't make this up. @RosenforNevada - who made up her business &amp; misled voters about her college degree - fundraised with Patrick Murphy, another failed Democrat who was accused of lying about his small business &amp; college degree. https://t.co/aA2YPV5hh9
With Judge Brett Kavanaugh officially announced as President Trump‚Äôs nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, the real fight now begins. I‚Äôm hopeful that the Senate will move swiftly and thoroughly in the confirmation process. https://t.co/NBcWCXjEQY

Last night I had the privilege of attending the Supreme Court Justice nomination announcement. I look forward to hearing more from Judge Brett Kavanaugh throughout the confirmation process and hope to see another Justice on the bench that will uphold and protect the Constitution. https://t.co/IOkx823T3W
The business @RosenforNevada claims she ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù never had a state business license, can‚Äôt prove it had a local business license, it never had a name, it didn‚Äôt have employees, and it never sold anything.   She lied. https://t.co/uaIllOipGc  #NVSen
Make no mistake, this is an important moment in our country. Once @POTUS selects a nominee, I‚Äôm hopeful Congress will move swiftly to get a Justice on the bench who will defend and uphold the Constitution.
We need a qualified Supreme Court Justice who will be a fierce defender of the Constitution and who will not cower when it comes to upholding our nation‚Äôs laws. The Supreme Court is no place for Justices who want to rewrite the Constitution.

There was a price when our nation‚Äôs founders framed the future with independence and freedom, and a cost when our veterans left their families to serve and protect our country -- But too often we forget that the fight for freedom continues with us.

The #IranDeal was a sham that never empowered the United States and only put our allies in danger.   Still, Jacky Rosen:  1. Supported the Iran Deal 2. Said it would be "risky" to decertify the deal 3. Co-signed a letter to Pres. Trump asking him to continue the deal

Americans do what it takes to get the job done, Congress needs to follow suit.
Programs like #VAWA save lives and have long-term positive impacts for victims to help prevent, identify, and respond to domestic and sexual violence.   Funding services and resources for victims of domestic violence should never be a political issue. #DenimDay

Jacky Rosen is so out of touch that she's parroting her pal millionaire Nancy Pelosi's talking points and calling your tax cuts "crumbs" too. #taxreform
Government should never fine people who can‚Äôt afford a product they are FORCED to buy -- thanks to #taxreform they won‚Äôt be penalized anymore.

Our #TaxReform bill saves tens of thousands of Nevadans hundreds of dollars by repealing Obamacare‚Äôs individual mandate.   According to the #IRS, approximately 70,000 Nevadans paid Obamacare‚Äôs tax penalty in 2015.

9 in 10 Nevada business owners said they plan to take action as a result of #taxreform including increasing workers‚Äô wages and investing in their companies and our economy.
Liberals just push hate and anger, while we actually get things done:  - The economy grew at a rate of 3.2% (fastest pace in 2 years) - Consumer confidence hit a 17-year high - 2.1 million new jobs were created and the unemployment rate is the lowest it‚Äôs been since 2001
Two terms of Pres. Obama left us with stagnant wages &amp; too many Nevadans living paycheck to paycheck.   But as Pres. Reagan said, "It‚Äôs morning again in America". With a Republican Majority and President, we are cleaning up the mess in Washington and on the right course. #nvsen

The latest in #Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúsequester scare strategy:‚Äù #FAA furloughs. This is why I asked the #FAA how this will affect NV.
Political ploys may help explain why #FAA is furloughing workers, forcing flight delays to detriment of NV economy.
If the Administration wanted to stop flight delays, why not start w/the $179 million #FAA spends on travel? Instead, NV suffers. #CutWaste
I will not stand by as the Administration uses #FAA furloughs to target one of NV‚Äôs biggest industries #ObamaQuester http://t.co/gIrjWjvsjB
Asked the #FAA if they can find other ways to cut spending. NV‚Äôs fragile economic recovery must not be needlessly jeopardized.
