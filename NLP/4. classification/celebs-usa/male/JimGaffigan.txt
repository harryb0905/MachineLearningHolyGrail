Like many fellow comedians @tedalexandro and I sat dumbstruck on this Friday night after our show thinking about our friend Brody Stevens. Not to be all sappy but Brody's passing made Ted and I realize how special all you comedians are.  I'm so grateful to know each of you. Thx
@JohnRoycomic Thanks for sharing this John
So sad to hear of the passing of every comedians friend @brodyismefriend.  Brody was a true eccentric.  The embodiment of a comedian in his passion, anger and joy. I feel like the comedy community lost our mascot. Bye Brody.  It was an honor to know you and see you do your thing

@senyorreporter Tim, it's this kind of small minded thinking that keep hash browns AND home fries undercooked.  I might be overreacting here but hereby challenge you to a duel, sir.
@mboorstein When you think about it hash browns are a religion.
@pameladruck Thanks.  I knew there were risks with me expressing this opinion but frankly I didn't care. I guess I'm a rebel.  I'm aware some critics may have read my tweet and thought, "Stick to comedy!" Nonetheless some issues NEED to be dealt with.

@angelamcverry Are you being pressured to say this?  Give us a sign you are speaking of free will.
@EWRairport @AskTSA AS -  I feel for you.  It must be hard to work there.  Everyone seems so unhappy.  I want you too know you are loved.  Maybe the airport needs an exorcism?  I’m only half joking.
@EWRairport Additionally,  I had my roller bag pulled for additional screening which will happen. The bag had some books in it.  The TSA person actually asked, “What are these for?”.  She then proceeded to suspiciously skim through each book like it was something dangerous.
@EWRairport I travel constantly and understand there are some unavoidable issues but the TSA line for security was 40 minutes at 7am.  My wife encountered a similar situation 2 weeks ago.  There are logistics folks that can handle this simply.
Wow. NEWARK AIRPORT does a fantastic impression of HELL.

@2ndUSRevolutoin I hope you are right.  I’d love to be wrong about that.  I’ll bet you $20 that Trump fires both Sessions &amp; Rosenstein within 2 weeks after the election
@johnmasciandaro Can I have 2 of everything?
@2ndUSRevolutoin I love you too but this article has nothing to do with my questions.
@KAW710CO I’m asking sincerely.  You don’t think it’s legitimate!  You are not curious?  It’s all a “witch hunt”?
1) If everyone knows Trump is going to fire Sessions &amp; Rosenstein right after the Midterms, why should Mueller wait till after the Midterms to drop his report?  2) Why are Sessions &amp; Rosenstein just waiting to get fired? 3) What happened to dignity?

@birbigs Mike they have to find their own path. Sure I could mentor them but we both know they could never achieve my excellence at graphic design. So why bother. I told them from a young age.  "You'll never be as good as me at graphic design so don't try."
@JackPhi93877782 @birbigs Jack don't be frightened of my graphic skills.  Sure they are staggeringly unique and powerful but I'm just like you.  Except I make really great graphics!
Mike, when you have a gift for creating engaging visuals, which I do in spades, you let your visuals speak for themselves. I'd be happy to mock up some compelling, visuals for your "The Next One" Broadway show.  However I wouldn't want my gift of graphics to hurt your show! https://t.co/xbQtE6979H

@marc_guilfoil @sdatwellky @robbromleywkyt Thank you.  I appreciate the invite
@FrancisQuinnJr @CBSSunday Jeez Francis!  Settle down.  They were jokes.  You seem like such sensitive soul.
@JackPilgrimKSR Jack apparently my piece didn’t show you that my show wasn’t canceled.  I guess you’re not a real journalist are you?
@katelyngeorgina @CBSSunday I’m extremely disappointed in you absence of a sense of humor and how we live in age where REAL issues go ignored while people get upset about a stupid comedy piece
@faketomleach Rob I wouldn’t do a debate frankly cause I don’t care.  I was joking around about something I admitted I know Nothing about.  I would like to see a debate on the value of free college tuition or urban plight but not from me.  I’m a comedian.  I tell jokes
