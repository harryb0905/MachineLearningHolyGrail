@ScrapbookJournl btw I know scrapbooking is not just for grannies :) no offensive to the scrapbookers of the world :)
FB is going to kill the scrapbooking industry. Walmart's market share will drop when grannies stop buying materials
omw to sf giants - dodgers game. why I choose to live even part time in la traffic is beyond me .. at least I have a driver.  napping now
or, how i almost retired *BEFORE MYSPACE* .. there woulda been no myspace: http://t.co/SRb1Ufu3
in case you thought i was a rough & rude cur, here's my sensitive side: http://t.co/SRb1Ufu3
@TE_JustMe sorry - I asked G+ to fix that - I told them to open the floodgates, but they limit emails coming in.
ok everyones waking up and i gotta go to sleep good night. yes i'm in LA. twitter/fb/G+ kept me up all night
@omgstephlol is that a command or twitter shorthand?
@giniji @pud haha.. did I? twitter is too pithy for me.. that's why i'm on G+ more.. can't shut up
@pud thx! just uploaded a bigger one i think (deleted that tweet)
@pud check out this photo I took - I used an HDR program (just more advanced filter) -- without it, it was boring  http://t.co/pMFyZAhY
@pud &lt;cnt&gt; so iphone apps, to my mind, are technology advancing art (like digital recording for music.. so much easier now)
@pud yes, it is a nice photo. if "straight" it might be boring. "developing" photos (old skool with chemicals) is just a filter &lt;cnt&gt;
@pud &lt;cnt&gt; making people like photography more. helps explain the crazy popularity of those apps, i think.   pessimist/optimist maybe? :)
@pud actually i'd really disagree with that. i just got into photography. i think filters make "bad" photos look good, and are thus &lt;cnt&gt;
@RazChorev @richardlai hmmm works for me :) i only added richard on MS cause we met in real life
@dwaldron thx sir
btw, is it just me, or is there no way to *really* know how many people retweet something.. twitter on web doesn't seem to show full count
you want myspace back? just remember this (thx @fadingsignal)  http://t.co/fHU7H5mn
@fadingsignal BFFs
@Percival i'm proud: i actually invented top 8 :-) the feature that launched a million arguments, hookups and soul searching
btw i am on facebook also, facebook.com/myspacetom -- people are angry about change, as always. i'm giving it a chance to see how i adapt
myspace is trending right now - seemingly because people are complaining about facebook.  anyway follow me @myspacetom
@OfficialMel awww

@msuster i did. you want "silicon beach" moniker to die. i'm saying "LA" will not kill it. you need a competing phrase that MEANS tech in LA
@benparr oh absolutely. just wish they'd use it :) and it should be linked to in a more obvious place/url
@benparr the posts are all old news. i mean that they're not really announcing the incremental stuff they're doing each day.
@MastinKipp @msuster @PaigeCraig Mastin the point is Mark thinks the name does a disservice to the community

@extrabaggs have you ever noticed MOTA jumps over the baseline and then trots? a superstition of some sort? ask him! (please :))

@jimcramer http://tcrn.ch/fO3vQQ story of FB mixup
@jimcramer booyah jim, but this article is all wrong. FB did NOT launch a service. WB just wrote an app .. FB isn't in the streaming game
I'm gonna crash. Looks like Hawaii dodged a bullet. Keep Japan in your thoughts / help if you can.
Kauai saw water 75 feet inland at 3 feet high, not too bad.  I think we are in the clear..
Haleiwa had 3 feet rise.. some fish stuck in the parking lot. No damage to structures yet
@chuckleberry  thanks cpham!
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center thinks worst is over for Kauai, but energy between islands may cause issues for Oahu.. optimistic though
@JaylinMavrix808 waikiki.. its rainin buckets here now
the shape of each shoreline is blocking the water in different ways.. it appears north shore of maui is the worst. waikiki is still ok.
in some places water level has risen 6 feet and in others 2 feet.. but right now, no flooding/damage
all water just left diamond head.. 200 yards out to sea the reef is exposed.. a minute ago it was completely under water
I can see the Ala Wai out my window, and the canal water started to flow upstream.. now it's going back out to sea
so far so good... water came up a bit and has gone back out. you can watch on the duke cam, or local hawaiian news http://bit.ly/eMU6wT
most voice phone systems are down, and emergency evac stations are full. thankful for internet and txt msg still
@NickeyHI I'm in a high-rise in Waikiki.. well above possible waterline.. so should be safe :)
@sarahdope @tomasbecklin @heatxsink @kyleenrico thank you folks. :)
will update with photo if anything to show ... let's hope there's nothing to see :(
conflicting news reports say the wave passed wake island with little impact, and others warning this is going to cause serious damage
people were lined up all the way outside of 7-11 getting some basic supplies. streets are now closed off near shoreline in waikiki
counting down about an hour until the tsunami hits hawaii. warning sirens still going here.. bumper to bumper cars on tantalus.
@erragu @minniegupta @erniereyy @hannahgregus .. thank you folks :)  i got my six pack of canned spam and i'm in a safe place now
