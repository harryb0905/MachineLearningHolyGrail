Travis Scott won the Super Bowl with that fit if I’m being honest.
Spongebob into Travis Scott what a time to be alive
Jk only eating strawberries.
Were not eating strawberries at our super bowl party today cause of the silly Brady diet.
Were “I’ll try and come watch the second half of the Super Bowl at your house” level friends.
@donald_faison Yes. This is me also.
@dianegld We wrote the lyrics and melodies for our parts.
@ZackCloudHall @KidCudi Lol
@bishpsknife @dianegld Spoiler there isn’t a beard that’s what I meant by it being more a mental state !
@dianegld Lol I think it was meant more mental state and less literally. But who knows?
Happy belated bday @KidCudi 🙏🏻✨ https://t.co/McGLjHx4TZ

@styfrstyxvx @skeletalstump No 😥
@skeletalstump I would time travel back and get the John wick skin.
@pttrickstump Big bird when he’s painted blue in follow that bird.
@eejitgherkin Happy bday my friend. Hopefully I didn’t miss it and it’s a magical one ✨
@stasijatherine This is from a video from 2011ish for a band I was in called black cards with @BebeRexha - there was only one sugar video (there was a weird montage one from believers never die but I don’t really count it).

@DILUTTED Sorry didn’t have my phone. Happy bday yo 💥💥💥
@OndrayaPerez Snap not on purpose. Happy bday my g I hope it’s great!
And dang this hit some both as a former kid and a parent.
An analogy for parenthood is when you give your kid a juice box and tell them not to squeeze it and no matter what the first thing they do is squeeze it.
Is it happy new year or happy New Years https://t.co/XlBeypGtdV

@JensenClan88 3 different endings in theaters.
@KimKardashian It’s good.
@billboard Don’t make me come up with my own bullshit Gemini take on it 😈😈
@bobbyhundreds All the 80s aesthetic choices with music/cereal etc are choices I feel like i make in my head daily anyway.
@billboard take on the “MA N  I   A”  ?
@mazieioh ... but seeking fit out never really works for me. I just try to sit in the moment sometimes and put my phone away and forget about likes or followers. Whenever I am drifting along like that it feels like I end up adjacent to someone or something else in the same boat...
@mazieioh Hm. I’m not very wise. Connection is a strange thing- sometimes I feel disconnected from everyone and everything and other times I’ll feel a so closely connected to something or a moment- or something trivial to someone else like even a chair in my house or something...
@Sethrogen Basically enjoyable is what I’m going for always. Honestly.
@pttrickstump Who should we sign?? (Hint: don’t send me someone already signed or a band I’ve been sent a million times)
@OnlineAlison Yes
Is there an egg nog x cbd market?
@cIandenstine You aren’t muted and you weren’t before. Merry Xmas 🙏🏻🎅🏽
Wow
Hope next lifetime I come back as a bread bowl.
@littlehotmess77 Fuck it I’ll do it live!
@kynzeeee Happy birthday I hope it’s lovely ☺️
@Sethrogen Yes.
You gotta nerf your ego.
@DontBoreUs This guy is my fav ❤️
@royalmilk_fob @lowercaseg1 No no it’s the juxtaposition of completely opposing ideas.
@lowercaseg1 Also “I’m so sorry but not really”
@lowercaseg1 This is the inside of my head exactly.
@Sashuke25 No. No tour. I was at a farmers market with my kids and I spaced out trying to answer questions 🤷‍♂️. I had a brain fart sorry.
@grandetheftautm Happy bday yo 🎂🎂🎂

@madisonnwebster I look at the og fad luke cheuh https://t.co/nfEkHEghtG
@folie_a_blue @mynameismomina @madisonnwebster @gilliansz @kenberlyn1 Yeah I feel like I have too. I just don’t want ppl feeling sorry for us about something that didn’t happen or loving a record because they think it was disliked- or thinking we dislike a record that we actually all like. I just want us all free to like what we like ❤️
@pttrickstump Yes it was blown out of proportion in an interview- what was referred to was the time we filled in for weezer at the last min and some weezer fans were bummed. There wasn’t any booing 🤷‍♂️
@madisonnwebster @sweetenerjoseph I think perhaps people like the album more currently with the thought that it was considered a lesser album- but time gives everything different perspective you know?
@mynameismomina @madisonnwebster @gilliansz @kenberlyn1 No one was booed off the stage. We filled in for weezer on a blink show that they couldn’t play- there were weezer fans there who were bummed weezer wasn’t playing. That is where this whole booed off the stage mythology comes from.
@madisonnwebster We def aren’t hurt about it and weren’t booed off stage ever for it- I wanna set that straight. I think there are ebbs and flows of every creative career... fad is one of my favorite albums of ours. I have the original painting of it I walk by every day ❤️
Anybody got a mic? https://t.co/v7j7H0Np7N

@jallen0140 Hey buddy sorry I’m late but happy birthday! Hope it was ✨✨✨
@alqhadog @mazieioh This was my intention. We all feel this way sometimes.
@mazieioh I took it down because I didn’t want to worry ppl. It was just like a human thought that I had but I realize out of context it could be worrying. Sometimes I feel like an alien 👽 but I think that’s ok.
@mazieioh Oh snap. Thx but no hashtag needed! Pls. Sometimes I process stuff unfiltered like the spazzy person that I am. Tho It’s a good day to remember that focusing on mental health and being kind and reaching out to friends is important.
@arzE Yes ☃️💓
@abenteuerzeit98 Yeah everything bagels are sick but not with peanut butter and jelly.
@ohcalumities That’s exactly what he said...
I just stopped my friend from putting peanut butter and jelly on an everything bagel 💪🏻

@oIdsfashioned Prob shouldn’t drink shampoo or cologne also.

@ryanshrlw Sorry I’m late. But happy bday buddy. I hope the adventures in your next year are even better than the last one.
@guav Lol a story for another day 😳

@halsey Mine too.
@Kmissxtotheo Thanks for being so nice yo 😎
@Abigail_Sharkey @FOBfans_UK @showgirlsteve @vettys19 Nah lyrics are a thing that mean different things to different people- always. Whatever they mean to you is what they are.
@FOBfans_UK @showgirlsteve @vettys19 There’s a direct lyrical reference to harry in the song- in my head at least.
@missbrittania Him and that era of racing was a big part of the Phoenix visuals too.
@mazieioh @vettys19 So does my 9 yr old 🙄
@showgirlsteve @vettys19 Funny you mention it. It’s my favorite current content. Because we had to track down a legitimate underrated creative genius to make that one for us: https://t.co/Dqakh1mauE - I grew up on the rock a fire band and for him to partner and create that for us ❤️🙏🏻
@ileventeen @vettys19 ... im not sure anyone has changed the outside worlds perspective of the monarchy more until maybe her sons generation (we will see).
@ileventeen @vettys19 All of the visuals are things I think about when we initially write the songs (stuff like fortnite aside). They are super specific. I have been fascinated with di as an American since forever because we never had an analog to her...
@vettys19 It was actually always a di montage. Kapernick was in the centuries video- but we changed out centuries, stay frosty, and a few others for this tour just to have new content. Kind of an ongoing art project always updating.

@showgirlsteve @hipsndhearts This is not a pop up and is not a bar.
@hipsndhearts Don’t think that currently is possible as it is Brick and mortar... spent an entire year trying to figure it out- to even make it happen once has been an enourmous undertaking- we had to cancel production once already. A lot has gone into it.
@OutcomingRivals @vmas Nopppe it’s my middle guys bday today.

@ryanshrlw Well usually it’s a preview of a movie we are about to watch on iTunes so it’d probably be a hassle to go watch it on YouTube every movie...
🙄 when the iTunes preview of an old movie is just the first 2 minutes of the movie and half of it is the opening credits.

@SUNSHINERIPTlDE They all are but this poopy air is all mine 💩

But it’s kinda like climbing a mountain- you just climb it cause it’s there.
You can’t facetune the smell away 🤢
Truly the harshest light, driest air - roughest conditions for a selfie.
If you can feel good about how you look in the light of an airplane bathroom- you will feel like you look like a million bucks walking around in the world.
Recharge yourself in the natural world. You deserve it.
Also the trees don’t skim your emails and blanket advertise to you based on them- 🌲❤️
All I’m saying is this kind of isn’t the real world so go step outside once today and stand in the sun and listen to the world outside.
There are no billboards here in Vermont. It’s really startling at first coming from California... but than it’s like hitting a reset- looking out into nature with nothing being sold to you.

@rocksound Yes this is in fact super strong. Why is it such an outlier here?
I wish peanut butter and chocolate was more of a thing in the UK. Cause your chocolate is so superior, the peanut butter isn’t great tho... or am I missing something?

@showgirlsteve @nathanbakker_ No currently it is it’s own separate thing but it has been a colossal task getting it done. We are still in planning phase for it.
@wonderfulwentz @nathanbakker_ No it is not pop up shops and it has not been announced (beyond that it is happening) I think we will launch it in Chicago thonaround that show hopefully.
@nathanbakker_ The Mania Experience is a separate thing that hasn’t happened yet. We are still working on it: it is NOT new music, video, or tour.

@GreenEggsandAmb They rejected it completely rightly so. They asked for a specific type of collaboration and we being young and thinking we knew better wrote a different song- it’s all good. Was a good lesson on collaboration for us.

@JensenClan88 Was always jealous of the train in the opening credits.
@halsey Go see a quokka there. Life changer.
@oh_heyyy_youuu I don’t believe it is an either/or- it was a learning process we didn’t work with the director insurer and wrote what we wanted - we were not good at collaborating then.
@Code_Angels No. No changes. Hence why it probably didn’t end up in the movie-
@CandiceMellor Have you ever watched the movie “overnight” that’s about the making of boondock saints and everything that kind of goes wrong from overnight success? I highly recommend it.
@CandiceMellor The shrek song is old- it was “bang the doldrums” they just didn’t like it for the movie... prob not a llamania 2 but maybe something different- no idea yet.

I live in constant fear of putting the room service tray outside of my room, the door closing, and being locked out of my room.
I only mute people that tweet “go to sleep” because I believe that time zones are something that were created to control us by someone that lives beyond the ice wall that surrounds our flat earth.

@marameansdemon I appreciate the love. There won’t ever be finished versions of these songs- the intention is to share where the songs ended- these won’t end up on an album. Consider them little sketches.
@soulpunkpixie They’re not for sale. But I’m sure they’re online- feel free to listen for free.

@azulitaa_02 Not a partisan issue imo. Universal safety issue that neither side has done enough about when they have the political means to do so.
one day it will be you or me, or your kids or mine- or the kids of someone who wrote "thoughts and prayers" everytime- or a child of someone who thought someone else would fix the problem for them... and by then im sure we all will wish we had acted more. but it will be too late.

What if we all follow the religion of Chevy Chase in the future and it brings world peace like bill and teds excellent adventure?
@mazieioh No it was a legit “like” not a sarcastic one.
@mazieioh I like how you spell centre 🙏🏻💜
Dang it: machine not marching.
@rubythecat04 Yeah except there is a Chevy Chase area in Los Angeles too and others too.
What if Chevy Chase is the life cycle of the world and we are getting ready to reset and go back to fletch lives/snl ?
What if this is a simulation and and everything is Chevy Chase only some of us don’t know it yet?
I wish I had a small handheld marching that could find the answer to this for me.
Is Chevy Chase named after all the places that are named Chevy Chase or are they named after him? Or is there some historical figure they are all named after?

Every time someone tweets go to sleep I grow stronger. had to start muting people who tweet “go to sleep” to stop total world domination.
I bet drake has a Benihana in his basement.
Google reminder: how do seals sleep?
I imagine people that tweet “go to sleep” also think French vanilla ice cream is too adventurous.

That said, I think it’s really fitting to announce that @TheSpencerSmith is back at @DCD2records in an official role working to help grow and develop new acts on our roster.
As a label, DCD2 has always been about finding like-minded creative people and magnifying their vision. Since the founding of decaydance (with our first signing @PanicAtTheDisco) to what is now called @DCD2Records, I have sought a partner that shares this spirit...

@PurposeOnHigh I do too 💜
@folieamania Great movie. One of my top 5 of the year but technically the third in a trilogy(? Unless they make more) not a sequel.

@dondarrko Sure but this is the internet so we compare EVERYTHING!
@wontignore I have a complicated relationship with this tweet cc: @bobbyhundreds
@marianne_eloise Don’t read her story about me (cause well, it’s me) but read ALL of her other ones because they are important.
@marianne_eloise the world needs more voices like yours, that are articulate, Clever, and authentic. These are all super important, but it’s the seeking of truth and positivity in the face of a world that says you should do the exact opposite that is most impressive to me.
@_farahm_ I would never mess around about something like this. Other people’s art...
@RoranKobayashi1 The second one usually insures that there will not be a trilogy. Sequels are almost always terrrible with notable exceptions. I agree on empire but I would say it is an exception.
Is it as good as back to the future 2 not sure but it’s certainly better than iron eagles 2. Sequels are a funny thing.
Paddington 2 is a pretty fantastic film. The prison scene is maybe perfect.
@DCD2records can we postmate crystals that have already been charged under a super moon?
@FOBfans_UK Dang that’s so sick. Gonna be a fun week.
@nathanbakker_ Hm not intentionally but maybe I’ll have to listen to them back to back.
@agazela_xx Sorry Patrick can’t come to the livestream right now, why? Cause he’s dead 😨
@aimeesarts Sunshine riptide. Was fun to work with butch walker and Burna boy. Feels like such a different song for us.
@ryanshrlw Lol it was funny. Thanks for grabbing me my tesco hat 😉
@missbrittania You’re the one that officially got this to happen so good work 💜 sometimes persistence pays off.

@KoriAnneLucero No. Again that order is incorrect - that was the way it was infested into iTunes - will be fixed shortly.
@NoiseyMusic @sepulturacombr This record is basically perfect.
@nigeekush @kaylizcabe @falloutboy Nah it was ingested into Apple Music wrong for some reason. It will be corrected soon.

Still I find myself waking up at 4am craving that activated charcoal #ad
Like I went 37 years without ever having activated charcoal but now that’s what I need in every product for the past year?
The amount of activated charcoal I consume can’t be good for me 🤔
Is your charcoal even activated?
@GeorginaRyland @falloutboy @PatrickStump @trohman @hurleyxvx Wow. Epic.
@JanelleB1990 Trying to go back to my home planet.
@swiftatthedisco You can 🙏🏻🤟🏻 please
@gilliansz Yep 😎
Lars Ulrichs dad in “some kind of monster” is my favorite ever- I wish I could play him our record.
Kind of want to go to a double feature of Paddington 2 and The Phantom Thread.
@briankeithdiaz Like the top of a zip hoody touches this weird part on my neck above my T-shirt line - also these terrible menswear sweats with zippers meant for traveling but not good in actual application.
@clumsyphiI Maybe the only benefit of knowing my hair always kind of sucks- so it’s kind of no big deal 🤷‍♂️
When I am going for maximum coziness on an outfit I always go the route of least zippers. I can’t think of a less cozy feeling than a zipper against my skin.

@marianne_eloise I’ll send a fob care package to Lauren to get you for your sister- gotta keep the fob legacy alive in the family.
@expensvmistake @mazieioh No no. It’s a long story why it’s going to be wrong in iTunes for a few weeks- it’s just how their system ingested the songs we already put out.
@gracetheftautum Always give me demos- never annoying... a link or a thumb drive is best for me as well as some info about band and contact info. You can also always send it to @DCD2records
@mazieioh Good question- the order will be incorrect on iTunes for a little while- it’s a long story- but will be correct everywhere else I think.
@mazieioh You are a good egg 🙏🏻⚡️
@swiftatthedisco No no don’t buy one for me but I think I’ll find one or trade for one or magically come into one ✨

...I will choose to go see a movie I only kind of want to see at that theater over one I really want to see at another theater... simply because of the temperature of the water in the bathroom.
...in the bathroom of the movie theater by my house the sinks have no knobs and are motion sensor but the water comes out this perfect warm temperature every time...

@OvercastKid04 @FOBempress @bst_wrst_thng @alijog except i don't drink the matcha at starbucks, i don't like it there for some reason- only at this local spot by me...
@bst_wrst_thng @alijog Ha I never knew it was such a mystery- my go to drink: medium iced latte whole milk with extra shot in it, if I’m feeling frisky: iced grande soy latte with ristretto shots and a couple pumps of peppermint, and for my matcha ppl: iced matcha oat milk latte w/ extra scoop matcha.
@fobwam Every tour we make something for our road crew as a small thank you- this was what we made for this tour.

@COPPERlNSlDES @DCD2records My issue with doing this- it will be far too costly. Champion doesn’t sell blanks wholesale- so they are store bought and then machine stitched front / chainstitch back. Feel like what we would have to charge would be too much ☹️

It’s the details though: does this mean we finally get the 21st century fox intro back for Star Wars?
That moment when they’re like “it comes with choice of fries or a salad” and you’re like “oh salad”. And then race across the restaurant to be like “oh actually fries”.
@briankeithdiaz Moms cut is always best honestly.
@DontBoreUs Ok let’s have have a blind toast study when I come to oz... tho the soldiers seem pretty great.
@DontBoreUs Wait omg am I about to have a new favorite toast cut?
@DontBoreUs Had to google. Is this primarily for dipping? What is the best version of soldiers (toppings/and what to dip in)?
Diagonal cut toast tastes better 🤷‍♀️
I Hope voyager 1 &amp; 2 end up right next to each other frozen in space forever when their batteries die ❤️

@titatiger What a time to be alive 💩
@twentyonechem There’s no way this is actually your opinion.
Like when I’m thirsty I’m always down for the kitchen tap, but I have to be sooo hungover or like literally dying to hit that bathroom sink water.
Maybe that’s just me projecting.
Cause when I was a little kid I was sure the bathroom water tasted kind of gross compared to the kitchen sink...
Alright, question of the day, is there a difference between water from the kitchen vs. the bathroom?
@LoveTheMayhem My 9 yr old ☺️

This isn’t true 😥 I actually fell asleep before I could take a bad iPhone pic of the super moon. I just feel left out.
The only moon I care about are multi moon power moons.
@MyHemmoEmpire Bingo.
@MyHemmoEmpire Thanks. was waiting for your critical analysis.
This one time years ago we found the bridge they hung off in that movie and swam underneath it- i almost got bitten by a sea lion or seal (are they different animals?)- anyway I was young but not immortal- kinda realized that w/ fear of being bitten.
@pinkmoteIhalsey Already done this one it ended up pretty weird... the other names for it are wild and some subtlety racist.
Also is there a bigger style icon than Kiefer Sutherland in lost boys?
@caffeineperez Every time someone says “go to bed” it makes me stronger like the slime from ghostbusters 2. I feed on that. (Also it’s not 3am where I live)

Blancmange ? That can’t be right.
@lys_angstrom Well the Americans fuck up everything- I️ mean get on the fucking metric system...
@naomimyerss 🤨
And don’t get me started on what black pudding does to the whole pudding is all desserts.
@bluebellhowell Not according to @ElliottIngham 🙁
@ewoksforirwin But then you could get like a chocolate cake or something- I️ mean the texture is pudding.
I’m not going for custard or mousse as the answer those aren’t really pudding.
Sitting here backstage thinking of how all desserts in the UK are called “pudding” but the. How do i order just an actual chocolate pudding?
@youngbloodtrash @Acid_Wit Brunch is more than just the food for me it’s like the booziness, hanging with my family and the standing around waiting to get a table.
@Acid_Wit Im stuck in backstage most days working unfortunately. But on my next day off yesssss....
Really realizing that on tour i miss brunch. Can you be homesick for an egg sandwich?
@briankeithdiaz I think he sleeps in em.

... I wish it was as simple as putting my thoughts and prayers here... but I feel like that time traveller. Lost and alone...
... he knows he has to go forward through time to a future generation that has embraced peace and love as the ultimate goal...
..he looks out a society that kills itself w/ its own weapons &amp; knows he is in a primitive age where life, compassion, &amp; love are not valued
It kind of feels like the part in the movie about the time traveller where he realizes he hasn't travelled far enough into the future yet...

@Michael5SOS I've had many of those. But I think this is more like not wearing pants to school dream or something.

@spacexphan fangirls run the world honestly- that's the last thing I would ever do ❤️
4. ... then to me you are a nazi 🖕🏼not super hard to figure out.
3. If u quote Hitler, wear swastikas, hang out w/ nazis, march w/ nazis, wear  white power symbols, espouse nazi beliefs...
2. ...hung out with others that were fans of the band, collected their old merchandise, etc- but then claimed I was not a fan of the band?
1. What if I told you I wore the shirts of a band, quoted them, went to their concerts, talked about them online, espoused their beliefs...

@azulitaa_02 it will still be the same- setlist won't change - also began the set design about a month ago and it will be Mania based still.
@GriffithBrook yes 🙊
@jadebarnett2001 will try and find out for you- merch store decides that but I'll try and find out.
@kvtereynolds setlist won't change from what it was going to be- a solid mix of everything 👌🏻
@alexok85 💜⚡️
@abenteuerzeit98 still mani tour and the stage / set design are Mania based- the set list will reflect this as well.
@gilliansz that being said there is no one more bummed than us- tour won't change &amp; we will have a record we are super stoked on 💜
@gilliansz ..."if you can wait three months we will have a great version for you or you could have a half assed one now..." I'd rather wait.

3. We can argue ride the lightning or puppets just cause but the black album is metallicas best album front to back.
2. Stephen Dorff in the first Blade movie is one of the most underrated villains of that era.
1. The new karate kid movie, if taken completely on its own (not as a reboot or reimagining), is a better film than the original.
I'm prepared to unleash some controversial opinions tonight:

@gilliansz we specifically expected y&amp;m not to be a radio song- that was one we put out just for the kids 🤛🏼💜🤜🏼
@EmpireDesignCA damn I think what we like about these movies is the exact opposite potentially.
@ramzyhilmyawan short haired Winona android almost gets it put on the list for me- I rented that movie for a whole summer from blockbuster.
@myEMicalromance it's longer and better sets up the prison world, the bleakness, and supporting characters backstories.
@myEMicalromance well I guess I was saying 3 was my entry point- also I love fincher-the assembly cut is rad- I never go in2 aliens as much
@_Stephf0rMusic eh I liked it at the time but I wouldn't include on a list like this personally or the a v p ones.
So controversial opinion (in order of most important to me): 1. Alien 2. Alien 3: assembly cut 3. Aliens 3. Prometheus (ya tied) 4. Covenant
I think about this all the time in regards to stuff like Metallica (first album I heard was black album) or Star Wars (rotj was first I saw)
When pop culture art exists across generations, your age and entry point define which piece of it is the most authentic to you.
Though it seems easy to do in the times we live in- don't give up on kindness and projecting that kindness out into the world ❤️
@tulingNiall nah not hurting his voice. He's good- ran it through a pedal that allowed him to make it high.

hi
Permanent mood https://t.co/XyisFhyeBF
@gilliansz nah I think that's all that exist- at least that's what we got hollow ones wit creepy yellow eyes.
@KawaiiPikachuz we will see- I read a lot and have a ton of religious friends across the boards so I'm not sure where I'll end up...
@KawaiiPikachuz I spent a good deal of my life not believing but it would be nice to- I like the idea of faith im just not sure I got enough
@KawaiiPikachuz I took my kids to church today- I'm not totally sure what I believe honestly- I love religious imagery and metaphors...
@OMG_itz_Rin @penceyparade agreed ✌🏼
Happy Easter- jesus died so you could wear pastel and get sick off chocolate bunnies.
@SurikaVoodoo these lyrics are very wrong- refer to my annotated ones at genius
#NP "PCH" by @officialjaden  🌕⚡️
@CaitGonzales_ lukewarm: snoke is d plagueis the wise in full acknowledgement of world building of prequels-cue single tear down Lucas face
@Laura_Guillon no I mean how hard they push it in the trailer leads me to believe that the movie itself will go in a different direction.
@taytayhive nah unfortunately- a lot of the snoke ones are kinda hair brained.
@WendyJacques75 I think she's gonna remain expanded universe only :/
@_spideyboy lol all of us opinionated nerds come off as rude- it's ok.
@newflocks in that way I feel like he already kinda always was the gray Jedi.
@kadi_10th 🙏🏻 ewan #youngkenobimovie
@newflocks yeah I totally agree with this.
@_spideyboy the movies are obvious but the new ones they spend a ton of time on misdirection with the trailers. rewatch TfA trailers...
@newflocks there are so many kenobi moments with her- that seems super possible.
@Laura_Guillon I don't - that was referring to how they presented him in TFA trailers.
@gilliansz good work 💪🏻👌🏻 that's beyond my patience or brain power.
@newflocks I feel like they have presented him dark since empire 😈 he's been angry for like 40 years.
@starrygoth it means I don't think they're gonna spend much time on that island- trailer feels like a red herring to me.
@newflocks I loved the palpatine family background for her but seems like a stretch-sky walker seems 2 obv but jj's fib about it makes me 🤔
@PantherAS90 I don't think it was obv in trailer personally-feel like they pushed Finn as force sensitive &amp; Poe as  a pos traitor in trailer
@hereisMUNA Jedi is also the plural of Jedi 🤔
also Gray Jedi idea seems way too obvious from the trailer-more like Luke is like "no more Jedi" &amp; she's like "train me 🙏🏻" resolved in 3min

@myEMicalromance that's been my problem too- are they called something else or just completely unpopular.
@gilliansz @Code_Angels she doesn't 😕
@Code_Angels gotta be 80s I think.
@Cami_Giunta @Sleep__wxlking yeah but was mini I think.
@Sleep__wxlking like short and cartoony but kind of almost a line drawing...
@Michael5SOS how embarrassing is it?
@gilliansz @regionalstump yep yessss
@regionalstump literal "flipbook" movement book- I think the book was the size of an iphone or so...
@myEMicalromance it's not unfortunately - more cartoony and it's an actual "flipbook".

Damn maybe that's just kind of a #relatable thing to say in itself 😐
I know people are always going for "so relatable" but it's odd cause growing up I didn't feel like I related to pretty much anything.

Coco crisp has a great name and might have ice water in his veins 😕 glad we got out of that inning. Now letssss go!
But when @Cubs roll up a double play like that it just looks too pretty.
Cleveland def rocks a lot of interesting jewelry. I back that - I would rock so many chains if I could hit 😎
Game Seven 🙏🏻
@chancetherapper @livley15 ❤️👍🏻 I would feel the same if and when the Sox go again.

@RyBlackinton easily. He was untouchable in this era- the trilogy with those and big is bulletproof.
@jbandit23 this moment exactly...
@NickThayer the cast is bulletproof: hanks, Bruce dern, Carrie fisher, Cory Feldman, the kid from children of the corn.. epic.
@lovinwentz4ever yes but it's got a different look to it- I'll video it sometime...
@TugceTugul "leave me alone"... the song.
Really would like to make the case for the "the burbs" to be considered one of Tom hanks major works- it is so underrated.
@JohnMayer rainbow chips delux tho. Yes.
@JohnMayer 😳 I think they're not vegan anymore - like processed on dairy equipment- fudge shop peanut butter/choc cookies are my holy grail.
@JohnMayer theoretically part of the late 90s vegan sweet tooth trinity with goldenberg peanut chews and the dark Clark bars.

@pepe_wentz45 yoga is awesome. I am not very good at it.
@Heeheedragon97 the train music video I directed was the one I learned the most from.
@Heeheedragon97 maybe - I had really good partners that help me with all of the technical stuff for those...
@RepySWentz biggest tip for the gym- it's never too late to start and try to be consistent.
@RepySWentz what are your goals?
@Heeheedragon97 I don't honestly think I know the craft well enough to do it on my own yet- I would love to try though.
@amanda_sheezy @Snapchat 👌🏻✊🏻🙄
@gilliansz I also only like to train when there are focused people in the there or it's empty- I'd go late at night if I could wait til then
@gilliansz I do the afternoon because I usually take my kids to school in the morning and am too shot to get it together til afternoon...

@onlypluggedin2 we just wanna do the next thing- people being sad about the past is the worst ✌🏻️❤️
@missbrittania it was a commercial flop compared to the previous 2 albums- I'm not sad about it-its special to a lot of people including me.
@reichenbxch I mean more so that it was a commercial flop at the time compared to our two previous albums.
@petewentz I know it was a flop but I like it. Maybe how people feel about that album- I'm just trying to process- it's weird.
@petewentz the raw ideas are insane- but maybe preconceived notions about m. Night and the shift in cinema informed it too much like FAD
I think "lady in the water" as a movie is pretty rad, like maybe it's more of a demo- not fully finished kinda like FAD- it's sweet tho.
@myEMicalromance throw it at the garage no time to think about a second trip.
@S_Wayneofficial many are called, few are chosen.

@petewentz feel like that means I'm taking a kid to school looking very mad maxish- still good to know I fit in somewhere.
Basically what I wear to drop my kid off at school in the morning looks like what I see everyone rocking in the desert at burning man.

Also got a chance to watch kubo and the two strings yesterday- the sense of pure imagination and heart in it are off the charts....
Gonna listen to the goonies with cast commentary on to fall asleep and have awesome dreams tonight 💀

As a kid you are punished for being disruptive. As adults we are encouraged to be disruptive.
Find me at the grocery store in the fruit section eating all of the samples.
I'm just a foam soap kind of guy. nothing better than foam soap coming out of a motion detected little dispenser.
the pink soap you sometimes find in bathrooms bums me out. it reminds me of the worst parts of the 80's and i loved the 80's.
Woke up thinking about the way Alex plays the ride cymbal in the "right now" video.
@plumprincess_ I'm pretty sure it is not a light saber being wielded by the storm trooper in that shot- not sure what it is tho.

end rant- inject positivity into the world - promote something you love...
and this is not talked about as much but is just as unacceptable- more than 50 ppl shot over as 2nd wknd in a row http://t.co/QtUQOqRj4T
.. i don't really even have a political perspective on this beyond kids should feel and be safe in their schools.
my heart breaks for the victims and their families... but we have to as a society realize this is truly unacceptable-and make a real change
...or where my kid goes to school...
its fucking sad that while on tour i google where a shooting in the U.S. is to make sure it is not near where my family lives...
like seriously what the fuck is wrong with us that we have become so numb to this, because it happens so often that it is not a surprise.
this is whatever just my stream of conscious so ignore if you want... i never want to read the words "active shooter" again.
@ycat13 you should get more often. Cool art.
