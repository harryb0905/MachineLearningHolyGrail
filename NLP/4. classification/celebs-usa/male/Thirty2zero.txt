@SpaceDuck94 Thank you. My rating is exact reason I stopped playing.
@tacoman245 So they got together and came up with plan to get more pieces 😂
@SpaceDuck94 What are the terms? No one said anything.... Pop wished him well.
@tacoman245 What are they beefing over? What did Pop say? What did Kawhi say?
@TerranceHarris It’s been tough getting Top free agents to come to San Antonio.
@SpaceDuck94 Cleveland said the same thing.
How legendary would it be if Kawhi returns to San Antonia after one year with Toronto? Kawhi and Derozan for 👀! And coupled with the first two round picks. #StrangerThings #NBAsoapOPERA
