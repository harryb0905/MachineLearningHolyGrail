Heard that coverage of the Men's DH on NBC was pretty weak.  It was an exciting race to watch, with all the boys charging!
@dph525 I crashed. Had it going on top but boned the middle and crashed on bottom. Skied through the finish hence the DQ on the results.
Another great day of pow skiing at Whistler. Good for the head to get out there and rip! DH is looking like a go for tomorrow.
@BillyDemong Great ski today buddy, you boys made that race so exciting to watch!
@JohnnySpillane Great race buddy!
