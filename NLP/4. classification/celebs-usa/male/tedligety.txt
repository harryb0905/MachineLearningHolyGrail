@fisalpine has hundreds of millions of CHF but “can’t afford” to make up the canceled Garmisch GS in Kranjska Gora.
@skigrahambell you over estimate the athletes voice at FIS, assuming we could get to together (Austrian athlete would never) and agree on anything. Have you heard Gian Franco Kasper talk? He's is immune from reality.

Real solution to parallel: separate new event and skis, 15-18m distance, lots of offset, 175cm carving skis. It would be tough in city venues but Oslo had maybe 50 people watching live.
Cross blocking panel gates (GS gates) has ruined parallel races. An alternative must be found. Snowboard gates? Bamboo? Half sec penalty for panels coming off? #worldcupstockholm #skiing

@Steven_Nyman How about running slalom first so top contenders DH and SL bias racers run together then reverse 30 for the DH. That way it cuts out DHers using it as a training run and SL’s DNF rate cuts DH field.

@fisalpine It may be horrible weather up there but when the president of the OSV is telling people it will be cancelled days in advance it smells fishy

@lynnecha running my companies @ShredOptics @SlytechProtect and skiing of course
@rachaeld_13 my hometown mountain @PCski #AskTeamUSA
@cavay i dont hear anything when i race but i have zero idea of what it would be like if i could not hear. dont know any deaf skier.
@MadGlav i think most ski racers i know have a great attitude. but that helps one stay motivated for sure
@mrcian23 @mtbachelor is awesome ski raced there a bunch growing up.
@mrcian23 shred is on par cost wise with similar brands and products. but cooler and better. its not cheap making good stuff.
@MarkyDub Marcel Hirscher #AskTeamUSA
@rsigreen use my knees more then my hips. keep my inside angle flexed
@lynnecha I hangout with my teammates and coaches or do some sightseeing wherever we are on the tour, I like to sauna too #AskTeamUSA
@SPN_Mom mtn bike
@jcmahmood skiing wise; skiing is good enough stimulation tho i do core and recovery a lot.
@MarissaBilbrey nope, just prepare myself physically and mentaly #AskTeamUSA
@jcmahmood if i am ski well its easy if im not it gets tough quick. i try to get away from the mtns when i have time.
@C_viner I have my camp I coach during the last week of June and will ski some GS and Sl gates #AskTeamUSA
@meghan_diamond winning the GS at WSC #AskTeamUSA

@brianbillett @usskiteam @Kelloggs_US My favorite stop on the World Cup tour in Europe is Soleden and Park City for America #AskTeamUSA
@SPN_Mom i do mostly legs and core. on the strength and strength endurance side of things #AskTeamUSA
@skiersdoitbest not sure how to mentally train so physical is more important. mental is letting ur body do what it knows it can #AskTeamUSA
@banina9 @USOlympic @usskiteam I started taking skiing seriously at 14 years old #AskTeamUSA
@frozenlight15 i started @PCski #AskTeamUSA
@banina9 @usskiteam Kitzbuhel is the toughest #AskTeamUSA
@pugsley_tractor @tamo226 i wear @2XU_USA compression wear then my suit thats it #AskTeamUSA
@rsigreen watch some guys on the tv just to see the line but not always just if its easy and not in the way of preparing to race #AskTeamUSA
@skiersdoitbest they should focus on building leg strength and core strength #AskTeamUSA
@nutmeg910 I watch a lot of @MarcelHirscher + @AlexPinturault  and @FelixNeureuther
@DaveElliott9 yes and no. yes more dual. no not for the overall or sl title #AskTeamUSA

@missallydandy alberto tomba, tommy moe, Kjetil Andre Aamodt #AskTeamUSA
@cykelliberalen huge difference. much less forgiving, more tiring, harder to turn. u needed to be way more on ur game #AskTeamUSA
@crubesch @pcski is my fav resort #AskTeamUSA
@skiracerprobs i need to work on my sl the most. I focus on using my knees more then my hips. #AskTeamUSA
@NatashaStenicka Tennis or basketball #AskTeamUSA
@SPN_Mom I think its important to play lots of sport when u r young. specialize as late as possible. #AskTeamUSA
@philsaurel you have never heard of my home planet. wax pours from my pores #AskTeamUSA
@sweetmatcha @USOlympic just active stretching not much static tho hips and glutes are important to keep loose. #AskTeamUSA
@jcmahmood @USOlympic have fun since that will make them work hard #AskTeamUSA
@momochompers @USOlympic i do a lot of weighted planks+twisting movements. just a little active stretching im not very flexible. #AskTeamUSA
@universalsports im training in mammoth right now #AskTeamUSA
@pugsley_tractor you should try to be as level as possible If you have ton of force and are going really fast then it is ok inclinate a bit

@rsigreen I try to eat big breakfast since I don't eat much between runs. I usually just drink choc milk since im too anxious to eat.

i may not have had the best olympics, but at less i won as many medals as the austrian men's alpine team.
slalom in the rain should be fun tomorrow.
Wooden spoon today. Sweet day for the bodeman. Now USA needs to put the shelacking on Canada in hockey!
Fun superg today, made way to many mistakes. Sweet for bode and Andrew! 6 USA alpine medals. Hopefully more to come.
Just finished freeskiing the superg hill. It's in horrible condition. It's gonna be a nasty race.
Wouldn't mind racing already.
Rains not kind to training. Decided to lift and squash instead. Also did MTV news and watched Will Brandenburg ask Taylor Swift out via tv.
Attempted to train slalom today. I think Mt hood in august would have been better. Bottomless slush. Off to opening ceremonies now.
Wouldn't be bummed about a foot of powder and a cancelled training run.
Just landed in slc. First stop; inn and out burger.
finally put together a slalom race.....but straddled. oops. pfft slalom.
audi "truth in motion" featuring the us ski team is on tonight NBC tonight at 8pm.
couldnt complete a 4-peat, but still a good day. today was tiring.
kranjska's pretty nice to me. 3 wins in 3 GS races. i debuted the new SHRED "slab" frame today too.
just watched the audi "truth in motion" film on the ski team. in my "unbiased" opinion i say it was awesome. it airs Sat. 30th at 8pm on NBC
schladming night race tonight! the snow feels like an icy block of cement, so it should hold up way better than Kitz.
i hiked in the slalom, but at least Felix Neureuther won. First father, son combo to win Kitz.
didnt have the cleanest run down the hahnenkamm but it was still a blast. slalom tomorrow!
tomorrow all the racers will be donating their bibs to raise money for haiti. Get ur favorite racer's kitzbuhel bib on ebay!
i can hear the craziness starting outside my window here in kitz.
fun ride down the hahnenkamm today, followed by awesome french toast and some slalom training. good day.
in kitzbuhel. had a good day on the tennis court. took down weibrecht in a serving battle.
wengen pumps sweet euro techno all night long, really sets the tempo for my nights sleep nicely. slalom tomorrow.. . .. ....
time to score some combined points for the first time in a while...kind of pathetic.
long day of sitting around, for one run of short gs. 56 sec gs is nice, i was barely breathing at the bottom.
long drive from zagreb-adelboden. someday im going to ski all the cool no name ski areas in europe. saw one today that needs to be skied.
another dnf in slalom. weird!? slalom is way too unforgiving. perhaps i should forget sl and focus on getting good at downhill?
skiing in reiteralm, trying to figure out skiing again.
packing to leave again. new years is going to be awesome over the atlantic.
just watched avatar in 3d. pretty cool.
when u think usada couldnt screw with ur life anymore they make u listen to a 2 hour tutorial before u let them know where u r everyday.
not feeling so hot. toilets don't make good pillows.
going to the grand opening of the new rossignol factory.
one of these days im going to finish a race without sliding on my slide getting face shots in the powder berm on the side of the course.
cant believe Cyprien Richard has to start 45 cuz he was 2mins late to the bib draw meeting (13mins pre draw). Dumbest rule EVER. Bummer
cant believe Cyprien Richard has to start 45 cuz he was 2mins late to the bib draw meeting...dumbest rule EVER. bummer dude.
pretty psyched on my first speed podium today. it was one of the nastiest (as in ugly hard) races i've ever raced.
is really sore. apparently it hurts to fall in slalom.
not sure if i was more frustrated when i could finish slalom but was slow or now that i cant finish but am fast.
can't believe all the injuries so far this year! Get better guys.
Flying to Zurich...
4th place and I have an affinity for each other. Not cool 4th place. Janka is pretty nasty tho.
bummer race at the beav...skied well just didnt finish. cant wait for the gs on sunday.
had a good day for superg today. in calgary about to head to beaver creek.
really hopes @TheLanning is ok. tj u the man.
