@B_Twice I know dawg
Which is not the case at all.
After reading current articles I feel like the press tried to make me seem like I had inside information on the future of coaches or players
That goes for every team, whether you are picked up or traded, it is still a change to the team.
. When I am asked, “Will there be changes?” my answer is “yes”.   What I mean is; there will always be new guys (rookies, trades or coaches)
I feel like the media blew my interview out of proportion and that everything I said was reworded or taken the wrong way.
God have bless u with a new day, should everyday be thanksgiving?
