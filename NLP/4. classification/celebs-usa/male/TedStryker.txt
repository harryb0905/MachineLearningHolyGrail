@luckinspades @AdamSandler My favorite song that I was caring laughing was buying books on amazon AND when his wife was mad at a dream he cheated or something he said years ago 😂 unenthusiastic yes for a walk 😂
I was fortunate enough to listen to the new @MUSE album before it was released so when I recorded the special with the guys (days before #SimulationTheory came out) I'd be prepared to talk about the songs.  These were my first thoughts and notes when I heard "The Void" https://t.co/Oj7JinIAWb

@champagnennuts it cost (more than) ONE dollar........ but worth it MT!
@GalindoTim so crazy!!!!  how many wins next ear?
Kareem, Magic, Kobe, Worthy, Shaq - it takes a different mentality to play in LA on @lakers and succeed (just like it does to succeed as a NY Yankee like Jeter) The spotlight is incredibly bright, the highest of expectations, so happy @KingJames is here to take it head on!
@nicadler I know that dude 😘

@s_keihani @alliemackay is it a good movie? I like every actress!
@s_keihani she's ruthless!
Still confused why Andrea threw her sidekick into the fountain, Miranda Priestly would have been more frustrated if the phone went straight to voicemail. Plus, you need that phone, you're in a foreign country and you just quit your gig! #ThatsAll 👠👿

@Worthless_Stuff 👋👋👋👋
Phil Mickelson just went on tilt and it was awesome (I root for Phil by the way)  I also love the expression "on tilt" - just don't say it to your wife when she's mad at you, "you're on tilt right now babe" - you will not get a good response back🤣
@yungblud Come on.... we’re waiting👐
@travisbarker @ThePaulyKover I’m so sorry! I hope it’s a smooth recovery and full recovery!

@briankoppelman @theholdsteady @steadycraig and next season, when one scene in one episode (maybe for 6 seconds and 4 words) calls for a host that does rock on Tv and radio (especially the kind Bobby Axelrod loves) here i am 🙋‍♂️  I LOVE BILLIONS!  Congratulations and well done!
@nyyankeegirl THANK YOU!!!
Also, Notting Hill is on but I only like to watch the family dinner birthday scene.
Let me make clear, the cleaning is 0% my stuff. I have an update. My wife just yelled - "I'm hungry" From the room I was in, I sprinted like Carl Lewis to the room she's in and said- "What do you want, I'll go anywhere in the city and get you food! She said "I just want eggs"
CLEANING UPDATE  she just walked in the room ( I basically have not moved a muscle in 58 minutes) Wife- what are you doing on the computer Me - internet shopping for a new pillow (not true) wife - leaves room (10 seconds later I hear the cleaning/organzing in full effect)
My goal is to not make a sound, my wife is cleaning up her messes around the house, I. CANNOT. DISTRACT. HER. This typing may lead to a distraction, TV volume is at level 4 (basically mute) I will not throw the ball for Bonzai and I won't thinking about eating food 🤫
I’m ok with minimum amount of water flowing out of public restroom sinks, but please give me maximum soap!!!!  This low flow motion trigger soap with less than an eye drop hitting my hand drives me crazy😡
The @GoldenKnights hockey team just walked thru the restaurant and got a standing ovation (and they deserve it) #Scotch80 at The Palms

Nothing makes me more happy than when my dog Bonzai decides on his own.. that it's time to get a drink of water. A thought crosses his mind that he's thirsty, and at that moment, he needs to walk off the bed, to the bowl, drink water for 6 seconds and walk back in bed 💕🐶.

@kevinandbean I texted my friend Jesse--  "I love you so much and miss you." The great thing is, he wrote back and said thank you, I love you too. I was trying to text my wife when I was working out of town.
@alliemackay I accidentally sent a coworker of ours (male), a picture at 6:16 am of me with no shirt on holding a golf club looking psychotic.
@MARIAR0788 @kroq @mikeshinoda @ChesterBe @linkinpark It's a beautiful picture!
Come see @DaveyHavok for his book signing  (I’ll be there too hosting the Q&amp;A). #LoveFastLosAngeles https://t.co/aRXOEdeqtm

@MISSTERYdiva 👋👋👋
Just did Runyon for the first time in 1.5 years, there were two dogs with a wheel chair as their back legs walking up the hill. I went from 😀to😭to😀to😭. I was a mess.  Merry Christmas eve!
@girod199 @Adorable_Mikey Mike G 👊 - thank you.  Merry Christmas.
@Adorable_Mikey Sorry it rubbed you the wrong way....It's a commercial for a company I love. How many times do you hear people talking about a product and they are NOT a customer or don't use it? I'm a huge fan of the people at HAMER and I want people to know!
@Adorable_Mikey 7 (not at the same time) Over many years. 5 are Prius (very affordable) 1 Rav 4 Hybrid - also low key and affordable 1 Highlander I also have a wife who drives (rav 4) I'm a loyal customer to Hamer.  That was not a brag of any kind! Humble or not humble.
