Kobe in his prime is way different then Kobe at the end of his career! The man played 20 seasons.. Come on man.. keep that same energy and start thinking .. We’re FA trying to play with Jordan when he was with the Wizards? https://t.co/dKXQm8Oy5W
I see you @SiP03!!! You don’t have to get ready when you stay ready!! 💪🏽 https://t.co/DiHLSdACcM
Facts! https://t.co/gMLEvElKAn
That’s lies.. Kobe made Fisher better, Pau Gasol, Bynum, and Odom... I played against Kobe in his prime. His personality and aggressiveness rub off on those players. https://t.co/sUERlZWCHA
It’s means he’s a HOF and a good individual player! Helluva career!! https://t.co/bBCqriAI4C
They just die hard fans 😂 I’m not mad at them.. But they don’t realize the reason why AI and other elite players can’t find jobs at the end of their career. It’s hard to change esp for all star caliber players.. https://t.co/eEetoe9ygM
I said he was a overrated superstar not player... Melo always been talented. I just believe a superstar player should be more about just scoring points.. There was times I def couldn’t stop him me and most people in the league but the name of the game is to win.. https://t.co/PNr1xqzO6u
Knicks aren’t Lebron.. He’s the face of the league https://t.co/LmWMcA6nbh
Need Lonzo back! https://t.co/Zm8seRvqQf
Yes but barely! NBA needs them to make it! https://t.co/Spn9Y8RymK
Yes! For sure! https://t.co/WkIhbar7Q5
😂😂 Come on man! My team went 3-1 vs him that year.. it’s hard to win in this league playing that type of basketball https://t.co/dmcTQbdDuz
🙌🏽🙌🏽 https://t.co/NZb94C9G6a
I’ve done it twice now with Nets and Bucks.. I know how the NBA works.. The amount of work you need to put it. The film you have to watch, how roles need to be defined, how players have to sacrifice even in contract years.. https://t.co/6VarujssFx
Wrong again! I’ve been apart of multi winning teams.. Suns, Clips, Milwaukee and now Brooklyn.. My one year with the wizards we missed the playoffs by 1 game band Bradley Beal missed like 35 games of something. Bench players are key to a long season buddy! https://t.co/L22sjFEo8Q
See u later! https://t.co/3DsTSmwPpb
Anything for the college kids! See u tonight! https://t.co/f54PnoT5ix

I select new people each time.. Want everybody to have a chance to be able to come to a game https://t.co/8wcedwjmcF
Possibly but probably was thinking he could lure a big time free agent or trade with the young pieces to be able to compete eventually. Guess will see https://t.co/oezrMJwjeC
1 chip 3 finals appearances in his return to Cleveland I’d say that’s a success https://t.co/fmSlKwP01z
Yes a man of his mileage and years played it comes with the territory.. He doesn’t get a pass but you know he’s goin to take off possessions of the defensive side so you need to cover for him cuz he’s def goin to cover for you on the other end.. 8 straight finals man https://t.co/75WzlS5XBb
That’s just life.. happens in the NFL. When Aaron Rodgers balls he’s the goat when they lose he needs more help or it’s the coach. It’s what comes with the territory when playing with a ALL TIME great! But most players rather have that then not even be mentioned https://t.co/PReeyxiGER
Leadership comes in different facets.. We can debate if certain type of leadership is better then others but what we know for certain is that his way has worked before. Right or wrong. Most don’t question him cuz he is a proven winner in this league https://t.co/ZyaNkcOFja
Facts @eddavisXVII is as solid as you can get 💪🏽 https://t.co/4b3Hnbrliw
That’s bigtime! Congrats @TonyWarrenJr 🔥 https://t.co/J1Q6ZVdwEm
Y’all see the double screen by @DeMarreCarroll1 !!!!!!!! That’s why young teams needs vets on the floor esp in clutch situations! https://t.co/h1G3VDMuat
Pretty accurate pre season predictions! I’m impressed! 👌🏽 https://t.co/CvHguq63rK
Everything is speculation.. Things change so much in the NBA.. But star players want star roles.. Easy to sacrifice when your winning championships but if your damn near impossible https://t.co/BAWS1mS0kD
Big facts... https://t.co/kv8FqVQFWk
So in other words it doesn’t tell the story. Let alone the season before in Dec they said I was done playing.. I love playing for young teams and helping but they didn’t do it the right way... Milwaukee and Nets are https://t.co/bHWccdEwWK
I had foot surgery in July .. was in a boot a month pre and after surgery.. Didn’t start rehabbing to September.. Once season started I was told I wasn’t going to play . Imagine that! My job was mentor didn’t even practice.. This situation wayyyyy different. https://t.co/bHWccdEwWK
👌🏽👌🏽 https://t.co/q1qvBFNaif
@Dloading 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Put us on your back young fella!!!!!!!
When the times comes I’m sure I’ll have some sort of convo with him and other organizations https://t.co/xpetbMSLVM
Will work with both this summer https://t.co/zVAbyITKkI
Would be very smart to do that. The funny thing is Tyson and I both are playing minutes on a playoff team that’s young 😂.. Suns will have to over pay a little bit for those type of FA or trade for a player that has a big contract( Holiday/Conley) But it will be worth it! https://t.co/rBkkHaTiJd
Me too! I see all these kids goin one and day getting their number retired and it takes you 20/30 years to get your number retired at @BostonCollege!!! I don’t get it!! https://t.co/fCvuTRvbPP
Very possible one day! It’s in my top 5 https://t.co/pRAkSsMVRT
Why not! https://t.co/WdNvSBYIba
I better hear you! See you tonight! https://t.co/Tw8m3Y1Rgh
Playing to many young guys... need at least 5 vets on a team and 3/4 have to play 20 plus min to win in this league.. Vet is considered 5 years and up https://t.co/4dKshh6C0L
Giannis and Kris .. Yes both those players started on the bench. Building good habits, teaching them how to communicate on defense.. Learning how to win https://t.co/PuRD4y1T7e
I’m sorry I have bigger plans then that! Maybe a GM or Head coach https://t.co/pWg5WNPiOC
One of the best moments in my career! From worst record in the NBA to a 6th seed!!! Starting the foundation!! Now there the number 1 seed! 💪🏽 https://t.co/TWccyCMeQM
Those look a lot better then a lot of other players signature shoes real talk https://t.co/1EbVpgxC0Q
No sir! Every kid grows up wanting to be Nike or maybe Jordan. Adidas, Puma, Reebok can get him if they over pay but When Nike wants a player Nike goes and gets that Player! And Nike wants him https://t.co/WZb0154T2e
Custom or Signature shoe? https://t.co/m3a67UXICO
The question is not how many fouls he called on both teams but how many fouls were called incorrectly for each of them https://t.co/Q8ApHK872H
Yes a fine is coming https://t.co/HyZhxint8c
He just feels it’s personal. When you get to the playoffs a lot of emotions run high. Refs like players are Humans. Humans can hold grudges no matter the job .. Just rare for a superstar to single out a ref https://t.co/S5dguJ81ej
Silver and Monty (Head of officiating) watch the film and see if the Rockets have a valid point... https://t.co/gQRmyunqsR
Wow! https://t.co/yPNdyhBX9F
Never good having one of your faces of league call out an official by his name... Esp when it’s not in his character to do so.. https://t.co/dfH3cwUqyb

Man you still bringing up old stuff?!!!! I actually had someone who was working for the Knicks at the time and was Melo guy who told me 🤷🏽‍♂️.. I’ll say one thing I rather have my name and be ME then have your name and be YOU 🤡 https://t.co/TMpoIzoA1M
Only 9/10 players actually play so there 5/6 that don’t see many minutes so what can they bring too a team.. So guys that are veterans that have a reputation for leadership, locker room presence , and good mentor ship to young players are value Huge around the league https://t.co/AE8DqlstDO
Both teams couldn’t stop each other that series at their respective Home.. But that Ron Artest put back was devastating. Kobe was unreal! Never seen anything or any player like it! https://t.co/IQVCnPeMYV

I rather have 60-70 more million and less coverage 🤷🏽‍♂️.. He can get back to one of those teams later in his career https://t.co/OtciY95lP1
And Padres have the number 1 rated farm system coming up 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/6M9cYH5kRS
He can always get traded in year 4/5 to a contender.. you can’t guarantee a championship so guarantee the most money and trust me he’ll have a chance later in his career to win a ship https://t.co/6M9cYH5kRS

Bruh! https://t.co/ihccWNQAJN
True but I feel NBA players are always trying to navigate to their preferable team more so then MLB.. We have more power and try and exercise it.. Just my opinion https://t.co/I0rRhAUs1T
@AB84 As a teammate of @LeVeonBell how did you feel about your teammates speaking negatively towards him in his contract negotiation????
So what could he say that would be keeping it real and not just PC? https://t.co/eUePgkDO2a
Facts! Now the question is Can that be his leadership way? And having won a Super Bowl before does it justify it? https://t.co/FtlFqogtb2
😂😂 why not just say I only want to go to these top 4/5 teams cuz of market and winning? Would anybody be mad? https://t.co/iFkQ7ocnVg
I can respect AB for speaking up! He’s right most players can’t speak up or their gone.. That’s the business https://t.co/6RijB5YYed
I can agree with that! https://t.co/AcTzin2EpD
NFL never settles unless their is a really good chance they’ll lose or make them look bad(evidence) Look at Tom Brady, AP, Jerry Jones list goes on! He took the pay day cuz the amount of money they offered was good enough for him not to risk possibly losing https://t.co/JCEBVeVc1a

This is why players should never leave money on the table or agree to reduce your guarantee money.... teams will promise playing time and can bench you at anytime or trade you .. Keep your money https://t.co/dsmOFaohLj
If Kawhi leaves this summer your goin to do that anyway.. Time to go for it is right now https://t.co/Gy4aYDKc55

Getting Mike Scott also I’m this trade for Philly was huge.. Playoff exp and another stretch 4 who can shoot ..Embid and Simmons need spacing https://t.co/knBWDLkRxs
Very possible... he’s a 2nd tire type star and in his prime.. KD and Kawhi being 1st tier.. plus he’s from nyc.. After what Philly just gave up he’s not goin anywhere this summer https://t.co/8Xuzw91FHn
Thats very much in play... This is where you can test stars to see if their willing to sacrifice to win.. The question is will other teams give Jimmy a max? Cuz Philly has no choice and can add a 5th year... https://t.co/WbJud9pRrh

It’s never been done before.. Houston almost pulled it off last year though.. Kobe might be right for multiple chips but for one 🏆 guess will find out... https://t.co/5vgpDiETI6

Only a matter of time https://t.co/dujDldu43s
They miss Rondo on setting the pace and putting people in the right position to take high quality shots each time down.. They also have struggled defensively something Rondo was good at esp with communication.. Health is the key and they haven’t been healthy enough https://t.co/HkvDuiEJlY

No it’s not.. these things happen all the time! Why not report all of them then???? Cuz it’s the lakers.. Lance wasn’t even involved supposedly and he used his name.. So you better be right then! https://t.co/LCGe2EdTOQ
No need to even report this if your @ShamsCharania ... Unless it’s one of the main guys on the team.. It’s really a non story..Makes the team, players and coach all looked bad for no reason.. https://t.co/Yw7hH3iHMH

Just cuz of the History.. Just like the clippers compared to the Lakers.. Great city but Celts, Lakers, Miami, Knicks have history and location on their side https://t.co/WchhEJJa9T
I’ve been cleared medically before and still not been ready to play... Being cleared basically means that it’s healed.. You can still be in pain or not have the range of motion to compete at a high level .. just ask D. Rose about his situation in Chicago https://t.co/2hYxKe5piX
Kawhi was still recovering https://t.co/lW5zT5hvjy
Nba will pay up to 3 months at a certain price and usually you put some language in your lease that if you get traded you you can get out of it within 2/3 months with no penalty https://t.co/v4UEuBmPbB
Why you think that is??? https://t.co/TFNxIAu2wl
When I got traded I had 3/4 days to find a spot.. I looked at 10 places most was in Brooklyn... Ended up deciding on a place in battery park .. Close to Brooklyn, good price,great views and only takes me 15 min to get to practice etc .. https://t.co/dv961Q3dyN
No need to defend.. He’s irrelevant.. Just enjoy this team and players on it.. Anybody that wants to bash players that are trying to help their team win is a 🤡 .. You might not like their game or think they shouldn’t be playing but you should also root for their success/team https://t.co/jsihWdH9Pw

No sir! 75% of the league would want him or get rid of the guy they already have for someone like KP.. Needs to come back this season and show he’s healthy https://t.co/BZy53ZTP5i
Exactly https://t.co/WbehmWg65c
The Lakers would gladly agree.. With a max slot available for free agency https://t.co/RSaVHspH1H

Ok so have him stay home? If he’s on the bench and traveling then he’s apart of the team... https://t.co/eLnlP9wHuW
If he’s on the roster and with the team you shouldn’t remove him until he’s gone.. Just being professional.. He still might come back and play after his injury Witt the Pelicans.. what then??? https://t.co/fny9flzuYd

@getnickwright really understands what’s goin on... https://t.co/WKH9zsOToi
This will be happening very shortly.. NBA and NBPA are on the same page when it comes to this topic of coming out of high school to the pros.. https://t.co/Ts9aOHC0hG

Y’all ready to make a stand??? https://t.co/f2d4adDByZ
No one has ever change plans in their daily life or career before?? Oct to June is a long time.. A lot can change from now til then.. nothing is set in stone.. https://t.co/DZWk0p5p0V
I think that Max contract is the other 10% 😂 https://t.co/GTIgyS7RPQ
They don’t care... Ainge has been waiting for this.. They have a shot at a title and maybe the fav if KD leaves https://t.co/7JeH9QjgVe
The farm! Whoever NO wants.. https://t.co/k3Q8XzEHYe
Celts will give up a better package and have way more assets.. they can go for it now and in the summer go get AD esp to make Kyrie stay.. https://t.co/SHr8KekPnD
Tatum or brown for sure with pics abs whatever else needs to make it happen https://t.co/PtJKQ5G1Sj
Look at what I said dummy.. I don’t think he gets traded til summer. Celts can trade for him starting July 1... blocked https://t.co/fmr3LCcN1H
Teams don’t care as much what the players want.. they think they can talk them into staying (Paul George).. Top teams will go after him https://t.co/KlghfaJUzV
Boston.. 3 first round picks and young talented players to offer .. will see https://t.co/joDNrWm9kJ
No surprise... Teams aren’t as scared to trade for players like AD as they use too.. Paul George stayed and so we wait for Kawhi decision this summer. Still think AD doesn’t get traded til summer https://t.co/1Qu8QGpstT
Gotta be hard with limited mins and opportunities you think? When Paul George can back he was starting playing 30 min and being able to shoot 15/20 times a game..In Bos is a much different situation.. Brown and Tatum have struggled at times so just imagine Gordon situation. https://t.co/XmGsNs7ZFb
Impressive! https://t.co/JL2yHIoo4C
The good old days! 😂🙌🏽 https://t.co/wxWGlOEIyk
You can’t fake 25 games! 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/O1ziQ44pvm

He’s had a great season! Very deserving! https://t.co/79alXa1EHe
I agree with you! Need All stars and good stories. I get it! But theirs 6/8 spots! Joe needs one of them! https://t.co/egXCEpIO6e
Joe Harris is a starter that is game planned for! The difficulty of 3s he shoots on a daily basics doesn’t compare. Like I said before he shots over five 3’s a game!Not saying they all can’t be in the contest! But @joeharrisbball better be one of them https://t.co/ud9lbddbPx
2 tickets for you if you add myself and RJ to this pic!!!!!!! 😂😂😂 https://t.co/tROa35JvlL
I understand this makes for a good story, I get it! BUT if this cost @joeharrisbball too not make the 3pt contest shooting 47% from 3 and over 5 attempts a game, coming off screens like the modern JJ Redick! I swear!!!! I’m having another meeting with Mr.Silver!! https://t.co/pyvXUOrmue

You might be right.. Steph making around 35 million.. how much would he lose if he stepped on the court and missed a game? https://t.co/XonEmbQIai
I agree... should just get fined for stepping on the court but if you escalate things then you should get suspended .. easy small fixed https://t.co/Ai51i75OHa
I understand this rule but Hate this rule.. I know their trying to protect players but having a player lose up to a million or even 2 million dollars for just stepping on the court and not escalating things is ridiculous.. but rules are rules 🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/LNJZlG3jXG
Yes https://t.co/jAwDwc74wi
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/ScvrFM8xun
This is literally like 20% of the league.. Any player over the age of 30 that hasn’t played much people think are retired.. Is has too do with player movement in the NBA, by this age you’ve probably be on multiples teams and fans can’t keep up.. https://t.co/Y19RqlAwQw
I get this a lot from fans...ESP when a player has injuries or a team wants to play a young guy instead.. not to long ago when Bayless signed a 4 year deal and was top 5 in 3pt %.. https://t.co/rHhMQWj0re

🙌🏽🙌🏽 https://t.co/p8LqmncSOL
Man we just keep getting better! Learning how to win in the crunch time is the hardest thing to do for a young team in the NBA! Never been on a team thats learned more quickly on the fly then this group here in Brooklyn! Oh btw my boy @Dloading is an ALL STAR!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
👀 https://t.co/tu51rJnpOB
Thank you Brotha! https://t.co/GrdRfCxyFX
Cuz there’s only 30 NBA teams and cities like Seattle and Las Vegas itching to get a team! https://t.co/NrPqIso6NQ
Been hearing about how good Rondo has been for young players since he played for the Bulls.. Always has a one of the best IQ in the game but to be able to relate to the upcoming generation shows how he can become a future coach! https://t.co/aUDqGlNSWV
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 https://t.co/M1f9WREI4R
Bingo! https://t.co/y9XNg8Qrat
He would average like 24-25 ppg and percentages would be a little lower then what they are now... https://t.co/9eiH71HDlP
He’s averaging 22 on a team with Curry and Durant... Shooting 46 from the field and 38 from 3... plus he guards the other teams best player most the time.. come on now https://t.co/LeYaGqgkKn
I can see one of those teams get a second person in possibly.. Just cuz your winning doesn’t mean your team deserves multiple guys.. Warriors are unique.. Nuggets are one of the best teams in the NBA and only deserve 1 player .. https://t.co/EY8obfYiKw
No Klay??? Number 1 team in the West, Broke two 3pt records this half season.. https://t.co/vGl45p1QyQ

I got u brotha! https://t.co/WlkJDlPWNs
Nets did him a huge solid.. Could of waited until after the trade deadline.. Capela got hurt and gave him a chance to play ASAP. He had Davis in front of him. We’re a very deep team, it’s hard to find minutes at the 5.. He’s in a perfect situation now. Best of luck to him https://t.co/l7kMCeYeqX
Huh? Their one of the best teams in the NBA.. You have to keep him.. no brainer https://t.co/Fx7mOXVLkO
Can’t give up Knox... To much potential. They’ll wait for the Free agent game https://t.co/UuiREqlw6L
Pics will be involved. Grizs will try and build team back through the draft https://t.co/ZvW2DnWO4N
Absolutely https://t.co/JdOndqHZwF
Probably.. They need him the most.. Will help winning and changing the culture the right way https://t.co/LAJ2rhfdbS
They goin after all those but will try to trade for AD 1st... https://t.co/VUDS9Jo3Iz
No! They need their cap space for the summer https://t.co/zyJKrdUR3W
Any young team that wants to win or team that’s m trying to take the next step you better go get Mike Conley.. I don’t care what his contract is. He’s a winner and great locker room guy! https://t.co/BLcajhZrZn

You gotta run and jump staring from that back out just to get it out of his hands.. He’s that good! You have to change your thinking when you play the rockets.. some players are goin to get good looks, besides Gordon you have to live with it.. Harden on another planet https://t.co/GVUvQASvpr

NFL Refs are the worst Refs in any professional sports league 😂😂😂
Crazy! https://t.co/1WFvCG0ERh
Romo might be the best NFL analyst
No I didn’t.. can you read? I said look at the difference.. man some people are are just.... let me stop 😂 https://t.co/gnPgGtijND
It doesn’t have to raise only extend from your body.. How do you think the player is so far away from him? Go look at Luka or Bradley Beal step back .. They either don’t touch you or use their shoulders. Harden smart! They might call him 1/10.. Keep doing it 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/IGLWlyvKer
Look at his right arm.. he extends in to yah off to create and huge space to shoot his 3.. your suppose to only be allowed to use your shoulder to create the space.. https://t.co/6ujqTIswb4
Now that has to be called! Refs don’t want to calm that and I have no idea why.. It’s a Blatant push off.. It’s crazy you have to flop to get that.. Ridiculous https://t.co/TTHSt8BURb
Yeah Refs aren’t calling that offensive foul/travels unless it’s blatant.. Up to the defender to sell it/Flop to really have a chance..Refs are taught to look at the defender for the fouls.. Players are so fast now it’s making it tough for them to see it.. Hard job for them https://t.co/xrYzgnrXg1
This coming from a guy that tweets me and has his background pic of a team that’s 10-34 https://t.co/8RMGsmoNan

I love it!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/fI26MF5SFK
I always wanted to know what the consequences those Refs received by missing crucial obvious calls that decide championship games https://t.co/aKh9br5ols

Can’t wait to see what @Nike offers him! https://t.co/ZJbiYVYe6N
I think he’s right and wrong... No FA coming to play with me.. But most would listen to what I have to say and most follow me on twitter and know I’m a straight shooter.. He just mad cuz I blocked him 😂.. https://t.co/rUmHn0s3Bg
Yes he did! I saw that first hand! https://t.co/PnMdOd1VnF
Facts! https://t.co/55ThDnUWl3
He’s back!!!! 😂😂🙌🏽🙌🏽 https://t.co/eiZVVfAvYq
He will be on  another team.. Might take till the summer.. Depends on his contract.. easier to move on it’s last year of a deal https://t.co/XCjSEx3qPq
I kind of agree.. But teams tell players to stay home or away from the team all the time(Parsons,Noah) you just want to be professional.. This is why your agent gets 2%.. Let him do his job.. Reputation is everything https://t.co/MdD8q3kMBD
Bad business and professionalism if you go that route.. https://t.co/ovoMkFvilL

What people aren’t goin to notice is the small things @DeMarreCarroll1 did down the stretch to help us win that game... Pushing Jarett Alan in the back to force Vucevic to the double and a tough turn around..Also leaving his man in the corner to make that Fournier shot difficult
Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Team in the NBA!!!!!!!!!!
Ice in his Vein!!!!!!!!! @Dloading
Omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That’s a foul on Gasol.. look at his arms when Kyrie makes contact.. They’re not straight up..If it’s at a angle then they will always call it.. Vertically is key https://t.co/DQJXiIpvhh

Game of the Year so far?????
Let’s go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SDinwiddie_25 Slump who?!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Making a name for himself 💪🏽 It’s time to start showing him some love for a defensive team https://t.co/zpOwP7dgjH
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/oHG4MEctHP
Toronto right now cuz of Exp and versatility https://t.co/6lCVbtOdTk
I think Milwaukee has beaten everyone of those teams https://t.co/htvUZiaW95
I love this Guy! 😂😩 https://t.co/3rwAy2KBt5
One of the best teammates I ever played with! Always had your back, and was ready to play every night. Philly opted to play the young guys after paying him all his money. That’s a hard pill to swallow if not communicated beforehand https://t.co/20oWV8K1MV
@Giannis_An34 a slight edge over Harden cuz he has made Milwaukee have basically the best record In the NBA.. Harden having a better statistically season but what the Greek Freak has done for his team and their success has him 1 for me at this moment.. Long season https://t.co/KCRDXv0eat
Headband Book! 🤔 https://t.co/eTHQLFlT3S
As a matter of fact I just bought my 1st McDonalds the other day.. https://t.co/gote4N7cmf
07 draft class 🙌🏽 https://t.co/qb9sl3c2H4
I know the rules in and out! I will never get fined.. we’re just having a friendly discussion https://t.co/le0Ta9S44B
Why he’ll be a free agent this summer and then you can sign him out right and not have to give up a first round pick. https://t.co/9jq80jTnbG
Most fun was phx when we went to the western conf finals lead by @SteveNash @Amareisreal @realgranthill33 but this is right their with that Milwaukee team https://t.co/x1hLST8zA0
To enlighten fans! https://t.co/3zowFrQmro
It can definitely.. But the players that can improve it aren’t on one year deals.If they on one year deals then their schedule to make 50 plus million and a team is not goin to give them up unless you give up high assets.The guys we have are just as good and we have chemistry. https://t.co/9SAtkv0y0I
They trying to keep AD you think they goin to trade one of there best players??? 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/tX5nG4yHQ6
You think Bulls would trade him? Come on now y’all.. that man is about to get 50/60 million this summer.. Plus his value is at a back up 5.. Physical player that can shoot the 3 makes it hard for 5s to defend him.. https://t.co/0Pen0MD7Vn
Who you think we can get better then the players we have here and keep cap space?! With Crabbe, Caris, RJ and myself coming back what wing or stretch 4 you want? We have plenty enough, people wanted us to tank a few weeks ago now y’all want trades 😂 https://t.co/bAS0t4fN6w

Done deal! Have fun https://t.co/8MdTlmW2dJ
Every college team wants the best high school kids. You just don’t see them getting the type of players Duke, Kentucky and even Kansas.. why you think that is? I’m not saying UNC can never win a ship again I’m just saying one and done players don’t want to go there https://t.co/lNrDgp0bjd
I’m saying Coach Williams plays the best guys he thinks is goin to win games. Some of these high talented freshmen might not be better then there Juniors/Seniors.That being said no One and Done kids want to be on the bench or stay 2/3 yrs.That’s why those kids aren’t goin to UNC https://t.co/mLN4LVYbE8

Agreed.. maybe like the NBA the more years experience the better the coverage.. But after 3-4 yrs you should get full coverage for life like the NBA and 10 plus should include your family like our league..These are Billion dollar industries we talking about.. https://t.co/GxXysnSRe8

Love Roy Williams.. Great coach but the top players aren’t goin to UNC anymore cuz of not being able to go one and done. I’ve talked about this with numerous past Tar Heels. https://t.co/mD3DOwUdRL
Most teams don’t take care of their assistant that becomes the interim with a salary bump. So that’s cool for the Bulls to do But l, for the extra year is very interesting.. https://t.co/SuLNXuswZt
😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/HnZplUAB7U
Bruh!!!!!!!! 😂😂 https://t.co/NALAH2RIf4
Toronto has good pieces but when you trade a player like AD you need a piece in return that you can see being a number 1 guy in the future for you franchise. Between Siakam and OG really good young players, I believe Siakam will be a All Star but not a number 1 guy or even 2 https://t.co/YBtwu3CYlf
If Boston Threw In Tatum then I believe that’s the best offer.. But having Kuz,Ingram,Ball and Hart to choose from is as good as a restart as you can have.. I truly believe Philly loves Simmons and wouldn’t trade him for AD.. He’s a generational talent , young, and loves Philly https://t.co/YBtwu3CYlf
Agreed! Trade for him and still have close if not full max available for free agency to fill out roster of another star correct? https://t.co/3Hy6Z7jC5j
I see Lakers offering a great package to get this done... Bron not wasting seasons as you mention and lakers offer if not the best something close.. A AD player comes available once in a decade via trade.. They’ve been accumulating assets for this reason https://t.co/1OXDjUyIKY
What team besides Boston? Maybe Philly? I don’t see anything else.. Lastly we’re not talking about the Rich Paul effect.. https://t.co/I5uqb8uzYJ
😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/HYuBUnYF8G
Any home game https://t.co/PLJ1eiwOhW

No.. When it comes to techs , no players wants them called in deciding the game unless is so outrageous.. None last 5 min of game or OT https://t.co/ejN5p4iGF2
Can’t call this! It’s double OT man! The game isn’t about you 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/82D566I8T6

Well you can see him tonight lol https://t.co/jvPv4VdxRS
Have to do some research but off the top of my head I’d say Yes! https://t.co/0GcMLc7KVo
Grant Hill, Steve Nash, Jason Richardson, and Derek Anderson https://t.co/TObWlMfN1p
Agreed! And they also didn’t sign up for that role.. When I got paid goin to phx I knew what I was getting myself into. Not all vets want to watch film with guys and take them under their wing to help them understand this league.. https://t.co/Thm1FLQp4P
Some players just don’t understand the league.. I had great vets to help me understand the business side to then be able to transition that to the court.. https://t.co/Q9uPxjTUFE
A bum that’s helps the youth and adds IQ and shooting to every team.. Talking to much isn’t the problem when your helping your team learn how to be a pro on and off the floor. #blessup https://t.co/gZVLnAlF6O
I see everything.. see you tonight! https://t.co/7BgtAezA2O

Some truths to this article.. Hard to find the right vets that understand the league, team, and what their role SHOULD be.. it’s hard when a team is trying to lose and still be professional .. That’s why we are so rare https://t.co/9WecQTk79a

Much improved from a month or so ago.. More aggressive dominant and more sure of himself.. His greatness will be determine on how much he improves defensively https://t.co/xydoDhGOQi
Yes sir! Keep balling @RODIONS1 https://t.co/dFOdACiCq8
Loved phx! It’s hard when your not allowed to play or practice with the team.. my job was basically an assistant coach.. didn’t mind. NETS said best person plays.. Big difference https://t.co/CHRs1wjTAi
Yes after surgery I gained weight and was out 3-4 months ... they stopped playing me my 1st year in December ... Still had the best plus minus.. https://t.co/8pT4ltxJk0

Man!!! This one is on me!!! Gotta make my free throws and cant let the refs be able to affect the outcome in the closing minutes!! Back on Sunday!!
Can’t fine NBA players for commenting to reporters questioning. Even if it is enticing others to join their respective team.. Those fines were put in for organizations not players! https://t.co/gUREccPSpM
I’m with you! College gives the defender the benefit of doubt and NBA gives the offensive player it.. I agree with the spacing but college teaches taking charges over goin verticality cuz of the reward refs give them. They don’t in the NBA that’s why there less called https://t.co/aqSoeaMacW
@fred_warner 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/IFsKnpNTHV
None! Maybe a athletic draymond green https://t.co/y92tmhX0eM
😂😂 I’m with you.. I just think college should start trying to evolve.. They started the process with the charge circle, I believe it should continue with referee courses of improving that charge call.. Hope all is well! https://t.co/fA3NRvRbhN
I wish they would of touched my hair back in college! https://t.co/6CM9pzxD9O
I said he was correct about that play! How about the other 10 chargers called in last night duke game????? It’s ridiculous https://t.co/Ftmtb0y8US
That play was a good call but how about the other 10 charges called in that game?! Way to many! Defenders are moving side to side and underneath the offensive players and continuously get rewarded.. It was hard to watch https://t.co/UU9JufXnGa
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 https://t.co/68061HwQPR
Picture 🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/TeCfbSYhp0
Agreed! Same thing with travels in the NBA.. call anything that is close and then we can assess after the season! https://t.co/eze6NpCMMl
The charge call in college is the most over called play in ALL of sports!!!!!!!!!! Man!!!!!!!

I’ve been known as a 3pt shooter my whole career.. The scouting report on myself is make me put the ball down and make me finish.. I’ve added my driving to my game the last couple weeks to keep teams honest.. Also no McGee or Chandler in the game https://t.co/oRMhWXoCsu
🙌🏽 https://t.co/yzxpyHtOpC
Love Luke! San Diego guy.. nothing but respect to him and his team.. As a coach you hold many hats to your team.. As a future coach I know that sometimes your comments are trying to inspire or get after guys.. https://t.co/uJ4wypypNd
Wasn’t a blow by.. They was switching every screen, so on my dribbling hand offs I set it up all game by passing them to my teammates until The 4th.. Thats when I started to fake the pass and kept my dribble towards the rim. Not about speed it’s about the angles and timing https://t.co/UHbvfEUWpp

@NBAOfficial Ive seen more no traveling calls this year then any year in my career? I Ask an official why is that? His response was his first job is to concentrate on the defender then the offensive player https://t.co/2UIy6BaXeh

Salty about what! I loved my time their.. you say it’s negative i call a spade a spade.. The crazy thing about explaining this to you in every teammate would tell you I’m the most positive person but very honest with them.. Team guy 1st.. but you keep thinking you know https://t.co/W7Bx6E0idQ
He’s apart of it... The last GM had his fair share of mistakes... They have to continue to develop and hope someone besides booker turns themselves into a All Star caliber player https://t.co/S07GTFQmxS
You think it’s a jab but it’s not.. They do have the worst practice facility.. They need a new one not only to help attract players but for themselves.. Every team as updated their facilities https://t.co/DJyiHPylEq
Great spot https://t.co/HuG8KvLZMH
It’s not 💩 if it true.. Just being honest about their situation.. Great city and fans, their trying to rebuild and it’s hard when you have young players all around, and 1st time new head coach https://t.co/S40cCp8TIQ

Our coach favors winning! Sometimes you can play both sometimes you can’t.. Spencer is playing his best basketball right now.. Dlo has had great moments and will cont.. Can’t complain after we just won 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/efskNP2Q4D
I think Nets fans worry about who plays and doesn’t play through games, 4th quarters etc way to much.. Whoever is playing the best for that game should play.. Were in the business of winning games.. Every player will have their time https://t.co/8dwFd6wb7o
😂😂 I have a couple more years left playing! Have to keep spreading this knowledge to the youth as a player... https://t.co/9EsmPXi97l

I agree! But if you don’t evolve as a player or coach you will get extinct.. https://t.co/3bCD7glmnV
Both are very true! I think it’s was the back back 2 1/2 practice before their back to back that had them feeling a certain way! New NBA is about recovery and taking care of your body.. These players don’t do well with old school ways .. Has to be a balance https://t.co/R5R2XiAkp6

Dope! https://t.co/YMoqB1N9cD
Makes sense https://t.co/LmTktBGD9A
It’s actually for the fans not the players.. Better seats, better Jumbotron, trying to make it overall a better exp... practice facility is for the players https://t.co/pJdgub6Cbs
They have the worst arena and facility in the NBA.. I would say that makes it a Need to compete with other teams.. Now they may need other things as well https://t.co/pT9bMuwvsY
Wow! That ref should get fined for that BS! Holding grudges https://t.co/401Wu8qP5a
Wonder if that ref was working that game.. https://t.co/qrwKJ8QHKX
So that Ref and Gobert has history? He was fined for something he did to him? If that’s true that ref needs to be reprimanded for that BS Call to start the game!!!!!! https://t.co/QN0e17kZl4
So why would the city do it?? https://t.co/SAnPKq4k0O

Great young players needs to focus on the little things.. Defense, denying the ball, steals, deflection.. offensively making the simple plays, attacking the rim , getting out in transition and shoot open corner 3’s .. Its tough when he’s out there with mostly young’s guys https://t.co/OTKJaVIF3U
Possibly.. in my 12 years most the time it’s never better to stay away from the team.. Even if you want a trade.. https://t.co/LmqNCccnpk
Tough to be away from your team that long.. Love to see if they can pay those guys/specialist to do the program for someone that lives in Philly or even pay the person in LA to come to him.. https://t.co/qeYtBHLbvy
Hard to develop and win at the same time.. Can’t win young in this league.. have to decide what they want, and it seems to want to lose and keep gaining young assets https://t.co/DPUDPybLa5

Since Sean Marks has taken over you guys have gotten better every single year.. Is this not true? Go look at y’all records the last 3 seasons.. https://t.co/wb5BvHcqBl
Those teams at the Time wasn’t a well run organization, The Nets are.. Good young talent, 2 1st round pics and the most cap space in the NBA.. they will get 2 good players this summer. Maybe not an All Star but 2 really good players https://t.co/26RSGieL0o
Before Caris got hurt we wasn’t collapsing.. having to find new roles on the fly https://t.co/PvLAbXFVGW
We’re to good to be a bottom 4/5 team... https://t.co/qoiXbdrhFC
Culture wise.. how many teams you know that purposely tank that it benefited? Maybe 1-2 now how many are still in the same situation years later.. hard to learn how to win.. easy to keep losing https://t.co/m5SypnpYqP
Tanking? We lost our best player and have lost 3-5 games by like 2-6 points.. could easily be 500 basketball team.. Fans be so quick to tank.. you don’t want to go down that road it’s hard to get out of it https://t.co/ddOxyWSOOc
No direction??? We can’t close games, big difference.. beside last night most of our games are close.. Our starters are young and are still learning how to win.. it takes time https://t.co/6KcvHXNZLl

🍽 https://t.co/t6h8BIxWqH
🤷🏽‍♂️ Teams feel like their not ready to win a championship or compete for playoffs so they value experience for their young players more then winning.. It is what it is.. it’s the NBA.. That’s where vets come in https://t.co/39EFsmTRA8
🔥🔥🔥 Best visor I have ever seen!!! https://t.co/eFncWUlLZA
Don’t know about that situation but my experience with young upcoming teams is teams want to win but win a certain way.. That way usually involves their young guys playing in crunch time gaining experience.. Hard to win young and be consistent.. https://t.co/fYndo8rvGn

How about QB rating the most important one?.. Less Int and hasn’t even played in the 4th like 7 out of the 11 games lol https://t.co/gZ9xRkhcAA
More important doesn’t mean Heisman winner.. Tua having a better year and yes Alabama is better.. Usually Alabama the best cuz of the running game and defense now it’s cuz of the QB https://t.co/6ig0A9eQN5
The was just 7-2.. play in one of the best conferences in the country and our best player Dillion is hurt.. https://t.co/yEM53g6Exl
Tua is the Heisman!!!!! It’s over!!!

So this is why we played at 9am this morning 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/7LWz3bs7EE
Y’all been in the gym! His confidence is crazy right now! Glad to see him out their playing..Give him and Tibs credit when no one else was really believing it .. https://t.co/yqZZAADfW8
Shout out to @drose! That man is back! You can tell he’s been in the gym and adapted to his injuries and the NBA! Anytime an athlete has serious injuries it’s good to see them come back and play well.. It’s not Old Drose it’s new and improved one..
👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 https://t.co/GTUy3ASEYF
All Star players love the TV exposure a holiday game brings.. Usually wear their new shoe or different colors for that game.. It’s prime time TV everybody watching. Some would complain if their on the road but that want to be on TV for it! https://t.co/n32st3M5Bk
What do you think the reason why it changed? And could you see Adam Silver possibly revisiting the idea.. Great exposure https://t.co/d1HKSNtEUg
Didn’t know that but it makes sense https://t.co/I7Vu4dtgXt
ESPN most likely https://t.co/eY7jiolRje
I wonder if the NBA will ever play on thanksgiving... I know tradition is NFL and NBA is Christmas but what if the top 4 teams played, would the ratings be that bad??? https://t.co/1Kfnf2Utyo

Just a weird start to the season.. Griz in 1st, Warriors losing 4 in a row, Celts Utah and Hou off to slow starts.. New rule changes having an effect??? https://t.co/eOXjBgCxWK
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/OWWt8yZMlq
💪🏽 Caught a body! https://t.co/JNUdaBEayt
True but he’s coming over a serious injury. Hope to see him bounce back! The league needs him! https://t.co/jSnbJbEciy
Players want to play in New York that includes the Knicks.. But they have to know it’s a well run organization.. https://t.co/UhCmC7UCmZ
No but a added bonus https://t.co/EAkM8WWzDZ
Bron and KD aren’t the norm.. They can do whatever they want and this year is different cuz 4 major cities have cap space.. will see 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/1jO7XRDInR
KD or any superstar is not joining a team that has a top 5 pick..Lebron was the rare case cuz he wanted to go back home.. https://t.co/9asWoMbChj
If a top free agent hasn’t already made up his mind the NETS will def get a meeting. Major city, Cap Space, Young Talent, Draft Pics, and top facility. Why would you not take a meeting? https://t.co/nFIIjGmGKI

So excited for this!!!! Love my Alma Mater!! https://t.co/dikFx58UNA
Another day another opportunity! (@JCrossover voice)
We not goin to entertain these type of tweets.. If we showed every video of every teammate arguing or cussing at each other, every fan would be rich! Happens every game! This is a non story, Suns just struggling so this goes viral. Moving on.. https://t.co/otFRobT7uu
I mean we are all entitled to our opinion.. I just feel like you would be the only one on that island all by yourself 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/B3RXu7HJ1h
How did the ref missed that blatant foul? stepping on his foot while he jumps 🤦🏽‍♂️ Come on now easy call https://t.co/CY42Sm3B1B
Facts! https://t.co/2tqiGoWYDy
Not if he got hurt.. look at Earl Thomas just this season! Hold out didn’t get paid came back now out for the season.. Look at Dez Bryant https://t.co/v8fwfDgI8L
No sir! What if he got hurt this year like Earl Thomas?!!! You think he would of signed a big deal.. he would of got the 14 this year and maybe another 10 max the following! Plus the wear and tear on his body.. https://t.co/i9u8Pe5nBT
@DeckTheCards Look at the full details of the contract.. Only 10 was full guaranteed! https://t.co/h1XCTU7X6f
Could of got 14 this year but Steelers never offered 33 guaranteed.. Never! https://t.co/EvYTCIIUur
So how is he clueless for wanting 17 but getting 14/15? 😂😂.. He cares about the guaranteed money! If he gets 35 million plus he won the hold out.. if not not he lost https://t.co/JdahVbw9st
Ok so how much you think he’ll get? Let’s see  who’s goin to be closer, either what he wants or what you think he’ll get https://t.co/aSyoyju4i3
What?!!!! https://t.co/DecqQc1WJM
If he gets this it will change the franchise tag! https://t.co/TVV1Y7cxJX
I got you on Sunday vs the Sixers! https://t.co/o25rtu9yPK

Yup! https://t.co/HYgMZTuaQO
I got 2 more for you! https://t.co/3PkG8CYLPp
I should of known better by your avatar 🤦🏽‍♂️.. Stick to watching hockey bruh! We can just look at your and tell you never hooped! https://t.co/9JzUl2yJpS
Your right but as of now in our careers we are both role players.. Either evolve or dissolve! I’ll speak on whatever I damn please boi! https://t.co/Cxrc5lf0Fe
The organization wanted to lose... but at the same time we was trying to develop our young players.. my role was to help in that process.. Call the young players out for bad habits, watch film, help them with their approach and professionalism https://t.co/dNxjKWn2CR
I’m trash and you ugly so we even 😩😂 https://t.co/DHJgwRShns
So wrong! Stayed giving away tickets! It’s all started in phx! 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/kXx6sAC2PN

Yeah why not! How your grades ? https://t.co/xUYNwP2ojJ
👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 https://t.co/gw4WRYoqau
That’s why your an anonymous sports fan https://t.co/BYyVkPKKJt
Stats like points and rebounds are overrated unless you are a Star player and even then can be.. role players are about your plus minus, shooting percentages, defensive rating.. Otto was top 5 is 3pt percentage last year.. come on now! https://t.co/MNy45zFVq3
You obviously are a real fan or follow the NBA if you ask that question.. must just watch TNT  and @SportsCenter .. It’s all good https://t.co/hD51FoXJpR
I love @ShannonSharpe but he’s wrong.. Doesn’t matter if Cousins is better at those 2 things.. Green is an elite defensive player, can guard 1-5 and is an Elite passing Big.. GS needs him cuz they switch everything and every contending team is trying to find the next Draymond.. https://t.co/D6kogvVeW8
You have to flop more now! New nba rules say you can’t touch players on defense.. So if the offensive player touches me I’m flopping 🤷🏽‍♂️.. Have to adjust/evolve to the new rules https://t.co/kzGDOCa4tl
Neither are trash.. What you guys don’t understand is the later in your career is less about scoring and more about team.We are all role players.. So it’s about the little things you do.(screening, communicating, boxing out, taking chargers, ball movement) the name doesn’t matter https://t.co/ZOtpqtr23q
Yes sir I got u! Tweet your full name .. tixs will be at will call https://t.co/GuHy9e7HiW

Normal to argue.. not be disrespectful .. but sometimes arguments can lead to fights.. Most times players end up being cool after awhile https://t.co/NxdBVwTkry
😂😂😂 https://t.co/uTmbKgHCsw
I’ve never heard or seen a player get suspended for what he did.. He went at his coach and threw a shoe at him and just got fined... But this is KD and he’s a free agent https://t.co/I67r1tJv4K
Heard he threw a shoe at his coach lol Big difference and ran after him.. This is just a argument that went personal.. maybe a fine of 15-20k and a DNP.. https://t.co/oPasE4vene
Lot of money to lose for an argument! I can totally understand this! No punches being thrown.. https://t.co/RSOTxy5pP1
They not goin to care about his weight only his body’s fat %.. He naturally will be in better shape in the pros cuz he’ll have a chef and will be on a plan.. also playing more games and having longer season he’ll naturally drop weight.. He’s just naturally a big kid https://t.co/kmaXW7aBTH
Naw but I could see 50.. LeBron deal once in a lifetime player/deal.. But with Zion hype and kids buying shoes.. Easy 50 million type player https://t.co/JDRSkxedJb

I think we can all agree he will get paid more then the (14mil)franchise tag next season this season..Still might not of been a smart decision in the end but obviously didn’t want to play for the Steelers or risk injury 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/gpScAMSCbQ

Fooling! In Dec I’m goin to have everybody come to the game! For free! https://t.co/6nToGCuv4N
I love it! Tried to help it out! Just didn’t like seeing people trying to Dog Tyson.. I played with him and saw all what he brought.: https://t.co/shwqphNZVn
They are one of the best!!! They did and we did everything right.. was a rare injury that needed a special MRI, had to put a blue die in my foot so the MRI could detect it https://t.co/xLDTNPICAr
Did an MRI in January when my foot was in pain even though I wasn’t playing, Did a x ray in February after all star break both came back negative had to go to a foot specialist in Indiana cuz it was so rare, was a partial tear in my plantar plate. Needed a special MRI https://t.co/rFY7GnV5lL
Played with a fractured foot for 4 months without knowing.. had surgery after season and was out 6 months.. couldn’t train so made it difficult, then you add DNPs and not practicing to give Reps to the young guys. You see what I can do with a full summer of training https://t.co/MmlRo16thO
Yes we did! We tried to help the culture by teaching and professionalism.. Might not showed up in wins but will help them in their careers https://t.co/QPSVvLBWXy
How would you know? You play in the NBA? Players are apart of the culture they don’t create it BUDDY! Players come and go every year https://t.co/rHkJAg904h
No! Suns are young and trying to figure things out.. When I was their the goal was to developed not win.. when you play mostly young guys there’s goin to be growing pains. https://t.co/WWFhalAZ0T
Suns defensive schemes were never to hedge.. Always to sit back in the paint.. Most teams don’t hedge anymore anyway. Like I said don’t blame a player esp one that’s as established has him and brought professionalism and never complained once https://t.co/61wZD4ptjE
@jasonterry31 would be perfect! https://t.co/ay3tVQf3BG
Every team needs a guy like this! https://t.co/XmZeUIvaGm
How so? Vets play better around vets.. better communication, in game adjustments and knowing your role.. playing on young team is difficult esp one that has been losing for years.. Tyson always have his all.. It’s just Looks different in a new culture https://t.co/UTUl2Kqwr4
So did he and lot of players that played for the Suns... https://t.co/WbQMwgbmW7
That wasn’t the case.. stop blaming the players it’s the culture.. https://t.co/95tW2La1hz
I knew he would be! https://t.co/WlV8xeqqLy
Perfect example too not only young players but Stars on things you have to be able to sacrifice and survive if you want to keep playing in this beautiful league! https://t.co/uXj43sjIrx
This is Key! At least 2 starters and a OG on the bench! Some young teams want all young players playing the same time 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/HQVh5Wv2Vx

You right! I do know this, even if he played and played well his value goes down from the beating you put on your body each year esp with the Steelers work load https://t.co/61t7PKfIjB
But is still healthy.. what if he got hurt like E. Thomas? Let’s say he gets 35 million guaranteed this summer https://t.co/IkfvchCCUB

So what’s more important fans not giving him credit or players and NBA circle respecting the hell out of him as a coach?? https://t.co/DIWUNFwQ8W
Fair enough.. takes a special coach to coach a team Of LeBron.. players respect Lue trust me... makes judge adjustments but is a great communicator https://t.co/3sB84vBhDk
Coach Clifford from Charlotte last year missed time for health reasons now he’s the head coach in Orlando the very next season.. https://t.co/CFx6CpcxYv
An assistant?? What other coach you know goes to 3 straight finals and WINS a chip and their next job is not a Head Coach??? https://t.co/8E2iVBAHHJ

Very true but CP did missed last 2 games and  James missed last night.. Can’t overreact https://t.co/t18XB0blz7
Didn’t want them to make a crazy 3 🤦🏽‍♂️.. They had no timeouts left was playing the possession game! This one is on me.. Fouled to early or maybe should of played straight up.. https://t.co/kcEeFsDqnQ
1st off I didn’t watch your show! Secondly, don’t try and use charity now when you trying to slight other NBA players cuz you think Nick should be in the league.. That’s lame! Just keep that same energy.. https://t.co/GAgVGTDItR
1st @NickSwagyPYoung is my guy and hopefully he gets back in the league, but someone tell @cjtoledano I didn’t retire 3 yrs ago I signed a 30 million dollar contract after being top 5 in 3pt% so watch your mouth. The older you get its less about playing and more about mentorship https://t.co/2P4JxIdfSm

True but this has never been done before.. I will be curious of people’s feelings about this in 10 years may depend how they finished their career.. Do they stick together, split up, or even win titles on a different team.. https://t.co/zl05L3huF2
You don’t hear everybody saying he’s Top 5.. When I don’t think it’s even close .. You hear Harden, Bron, KD, Russ, AD, even Kawhi... https://t.co/anS94rDKdT
It’s crazy to think since KD arrived this man might be the most unappreciated superstar.. Maybe that’s not the word I’m looking for but his impact on the game is so much bigger then his 3’s .. Like man he was bout to take over the face of the league at one time.. https://t.co/9UHnf7yOIm

Could be! But I would of gave a distance between myself and CP.. had to know he was goin to react... hence the finger in the face https://t.co/Lk4DVjUbmU
I do see something.. hard to tell intent.. after he wipes his face Rondo turns his head.. If you spit on a man don’t you think you would be prepared for his reaction? https://t.co/hoptatoSce
👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 https://t.co/nSsM1vyMpm
No it’s doesn’t.. but your past history does.. This is Ingram 1st offense.. Rondo been in some other scuffles.. could see him get 3 games and Cp 2 games https://t.co/IbDoxw0mKQ
But the results do matter in the NBA.. Remember Affallo last year?? Threw a Haymaker! If he connects he gets 10 games.. He missed and only got 1 or 2.. https://t.co/yTJV1FASZS
10 is way to much.. maybe if his punch connected https://t.co/z0kPiFg5qC

If next season they cut the games from 162 to 100 they would still celebrate like that.. It’s the culture.. playing 162 is impressive but the celebrating comes cuz only 10 out of 30 make it and 8 go to playoffs not the total amount of games https://t.co/EQuHOnnitL

This boi earned this!!!!!!! 21 years old and already a top 5 scorer in the NBA! Now it starts for him! Congrats boi! https://t.co/0qZxLNfwEq
I don’t know if its ring chasing if you get traded.. Now if you sign somewhere to advance your chances while the team is stacked already, then its ring chasing 😂😂 https://t.co/SmRrQLW2l6
If you draft well you can win! Spurs, Heat, and Warriors, Even Det.. But when Knicks, Bos, Bulls, and Lakers are good the league is better https://t.co/CzCzYu53rQ
Don’t like it! We need our Big markets to be better! When they’re good the NBA business is much better! https://t.co/GmW4ncPxPq
Cuz of scheduling.. East teams play each other 3/4 teams and west teams only twice.. So... Eastern conf teams already has advantage cuz west playing a harder schedule https://t.co/kLlEEJHfKG
Not a fan of it but if Fans call for it the NBA is known for trying/changing rules... https://t.co/j9b688GxTF
I like the idea.. Well something is for sure to change if this keeps up https://t.co/H5a6lHvXAw
Interesting, maybe to combat that the league makes the teams payroll bottom line higher so forcing teams to have to spend more per year instead of saving and tanking https://t.co/rNCHZzgz90

Getting traded rather then signing is a big difference.. when you get traded both teams lose pieces or draft picks .. watch when kawhi gets traded the team he goes to will lose a lot https://t.co/ER69sQLD43
This is why no one will know your name! https://t.co/OgHlDWe3pA
Yes and make the most amount of money as possible.. https://t.co/cigvId44s3
I believe he didn’t have the big time offers, only a couple good teams had money and it dried up fast.. But u can’t tell me if teams knew he would play for 10 mil let alone 5 he wouldn’t of gotten some.. https://t.co/7BIDqGY8ST
Big difference chasing a ring at the end of your career when your skills are diminishing rather in your prime as a All Star.... https://t.co/rLs8roTpBi

😂 I know what he said.. But if the owner have never asked about it obviously they really don’t care.. Even Jordan last couple years he only signed 1 year deals.. Only 1-3 players in the NBA are doing this, it’s not a problem plus it’s good for the NBA https://t.co/v3YrsOqwuj
This y’all 🐐🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/FAcMCM2fKG
My @BostonCollege degree would say other wise https://t.co/t7SxRYmMXR
I agree! Houston had a chance, Philly and Bos are coming! And let’s see where Bron goes.. This isn’t the NFL usually 4-6 teams have a chance, but with good management like GS you can win a chip. Like Detroit back in the day https://t.co/nTMk2t5SE5
What concession was you thinking about giving the middle class?? I just don’t think that’s goin to fly. If anything get rid of that hard cap and now we talking https://t.co/tImrTy3Udo
The Stars are already conceding money by leaving their team, now you want them to be forced to sign min 3 year contracts?? Only players that take advantage of the rules are KD and Bron cuz of the money they make off the court https://t.co/tImrTy3Udo
The culture.. Look at the warriors! They drafted all their main players that won that 1st championship https://t.co/1kR13IDD1q

I think one will wind up in Dallas https://t.co/zP5tNXzHBA
Very impressive... Pau All Star, Lamar I believe was 6th man and Bynum was really good.. Kobe lead that team and should def get more credit for that title.. I believe since he won those title we def look at him differently.. Can’t say Shaq was the reason! He earned that!! https://t.co/8n87Z8tihN
No one said he was the only good player! Every team that wins a Chip has tons of good players.. But there’s a difference between really good and All Star good.. https://t.co/j46uclX0uz
I think more players have won chips without multiple All-Stars then you think.. It’s hard to get 3 guys on one team to the All -Star game.. Houston only has 1 this season!!! When Cavs one a Title only Kyrie made it.. https://t.co/TUflUB6glR
Every champion needs another Star.. no problems having that.. It’s needed 98% of the time.. ESP in basketball.. https://t.co/nNMR9tTw3O
Yes!!!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/vzxHZpfupG
Most Lebron with Cavs and Steph Curry 1st title... That year was amazing.. https://t.co/6mUFsgo5Ig
This actually might be true BUT harder to win with less talent around and that’s what Super Stars get judge on, Right it wrong.. MVPs will always stand out no matter the team, but lifting others that aren’t stars to the title is what separates some of these all time greats.. https://t.co/CivNUXqKHN

I can respect your opinion.. https://t.co/bO5fP1WCZW
JA those moments your talking about are def not easy but knowing you don’t need to ball every game for your team to win.. Being on a team that no team can double you cuz of best shooting team in history of basketball. 2 time MVP goes 3-15 and still win..You get my drift ?? https://t.co/TneAnnlXpS
I didn’t love that move but I understood it.. Was happy after he won a couple and went back to Cleveland https://t.co/SaDhvZuaE2
😂😂 possibly but it means more once you beat if you ever do! Like when lebron did https://t.co/LJ1Lu02yum

No your a joke to think I was just talking about this game https://t.co/ywvoxMwgLY
I’m not! I’m saying it’s time for a new challenge! He’s about to get his rings! He’s a beast 2nd best.. needs his own team https://t.co/rPR8eU0pib

😂😂😂 Naw!! https://t.co/WIW3DxBsJY
Maybe or maybe not .. I’m sure their is plenty of good teams he can join https://t.co/n3eMc7q8T1
After this Ring I hope KD goes somewhere else and tries to win one with his own team.. He got his validation.. He’s one of the best in the World it’s time.. Just my opinion. Not suppose to be this easy 🤷🏽‍♂️
Don’t worry he’ll hit 7 3’s in game 4 😂😂.. With this team your afforded off nights https://t.co/G3ZwZ9vknJ

Facts! Will see what the NFL players do when their CBA is up!!!! https://t.co/4AW91C4Tqb
Yes! This just isn’t about the anthem.. The NFL has one guy being jury and executioner.. That’s ridiculous! They can change any rule without players vote.. Adam Silver always goes to the players 1st.. Were in this together! https://t.co/0L4ICrhTuA

You tell Bron has gotten older and wiser! That man has taken more charges in this playoffs then he has his whole career
Then why rush him back the last 10 games instead of waiting til next season??? https://t.co/VRj9XA6zvQ
If I’m the owner I want to see the number 1 pick play.. Now if you believe that the player is not good enough to play then someone needs to be held accountable for drafting that player after the season https://t.co/xoLW7BMx26
Philly not winning the chip.. this playoffs is about gaining experience for their young core.. It’s not an experiment when your the number 1 pick man https://t.co/l6dTOvpL3S
Cuz he’s the number 1 pick.. I don’t care if he was 0-0 in 32 min.. has to be out there to gain experience https://t.co/XHxHnjtnwy
TJ def deserves to play but when your the number 1 pick you gotta play!!!!! Even if your playing terrible https://t.co/92ExDCm98y
Im shocked he’s not getting any playing time! Why bring him back the last 10 games if he’s not goin to play in the playoffs and get valuable experience???? https://t.co/9SDynbnkkU
Man that’s not skates! He closed out fast cuz he’s an elite 3pt shooter 😂.. man stop it https://t.co/DIMeK3pVPw
I agree! I do It off the ball when the other team is in the penalty to get FTs... but yes just stop calling It all together https://t.co/6yjc9nsncQ
Every ref should just stop calling every foul a player attempts to flop.. Even if they get a couple wrong players will stop doing it.. after not calling it they’ll stop trying cuz it’s looks bad if the ref doesn’t bail them out! https://t.co/dNioQ95mJy
@haralabob Can’t wait until they play Houston cuz Houston starts 4 good defenders and will switch everything.. Will take away every pin down action of Klay and Steph.. No easy buckets.. Will make you play one on one like how the Warriors do on defense.. Can’t wait!!
That’s what everybody’s waiting for! https://t.co/BFvNhlE0TL

All depends if Lebron said he was coming.. If he said he would come if I get Kawhi!!! Then whatever I had to offer, If not just one of my young studs and a pick https://t.co/PprIytDeSU

👌🏽👌🏽 https://t.co/tV7LgGOwsX
Depends on the degree.. is there any force, is the player actually hurt.. It’s a judgement call.. That’s why players are rewarded on acting they’ve been shot even when it’s minor https://t.co/Pr2xnKetXx
Players get rewarded for flopping and acting like they’ve been shot... will continue if they review everything https://t.co/s5lgbuPPJH
@JonesOnTheNBA was talking about Thompson.. He has to play.. He can guard and rebounds so well that gives Them extra poss.. They wouldn’t of won the chip without him https://t.co/FZhkL05brb

👀 https://t.co/FPzN86Qpqt
Y’all worried about the wrong thing lol.. It was a bad call.. Happens every game but this was just last second https://t.co/SGvKMiIu0l
No Sir.. If Gobert was straight up but it a clear lunge knowing they needed a 3. Credit PG he got him lunging towards him in the Air.. Those are the ones you call https://t.co/sLiiBF4ttN
Man stop! We know it’s hard but that’s in easy call!!!! https://t.co/L4qv3l7RcO

I don’t care who wins or losses but that call has to be made.. Unacceptable https://t.co/zfCkTbjq2w
Very true but this was obvious.. look at Quinn Snyder on the sideline! He knew it was a foul https://t.co/PE3XQvlFxS
No sir! Gobert jumped forward.. Foul every time https://t.co/rsguJ6NRsc
I don’t say This often but their has to be consequences for not calling that foul.. Unacceptable!

Oh I think they try another year and see if it works.. Then I would either trade him or Jimmy.. But I need another year to see https://t.co/9B1tLBmEsU

@candicewiggins what’s up?!! How you been?!!
That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard.. Players love John can’t speak for the media.. One of the most unselfish and talent PGs in the league.. Stuff comes out like this when your team loses! Example the Cavs! Now you hear about there meeting and rift https://t.co/DaqhhwojLb

Leaning towards analyst for a couple years then coaching https://t.co/vYFzEqXeQP
Different personnel.. Your only as good as your talent and the adjustments you make.. Bucks are good but not elite .. They need Jabari https://t.co/w4K5V3dYUv
Kidd put the franchise in the right direction. No player/coach wanted to come to Milwaukee before him.. He help Giannas become a Star.. he left it better then when got the job https://t.co/HZHsOPAtLw

I believe those guys need to play.. lakers are looking long term.. Us vets get it.. but don’t think it’s far for him to sit for years.. trade him or buy him out https://t.co/4k9ZHlikuO
Deng is a 4 at this part in his career.. Kuzma, Nance and Randall at times are getting all of those minutes https://t.co/U3w5ScxH8y
That’s a trend on young teams.. Esp holding on to you for the sake of being able to trade u at the last minute instead of buying you out.. https://t.co/zmiJpJjhvZ
Not really fair to him.. they paid him to come and play and then went young and change management.. Now he’s stuck, he would love to go somewhere and play I bet https://t.co/ffFDZl4Rfi

#LiveToForgive is a book that I believe you must add to your shelf. It releases today and is a look at the messiness that is forgiveness and why we all struggle with moving forward when someone hurts us. Highly recommend you get @JasonRomano’s new book. https://t.co/aCNNzwhsK2…

Yes I believe a Kid should be able to come out of high school if he’s ready.. If you don’t get drafted you should be able to go to college kid of like Baseball https://t.co/7k4HiN8ln2
Sir when have an opportunity to make over 10-15 millions of dollars to be a lottery pic, you leave! You can go back to school for free in the summer to get your degree! The NBA is a once in a lifetime opportunity.. https://t.co/5CYs5gqfKV
His handle and decision making not of what Tra Young is.. also Tra is an elite shooter off the dribble .. very rare to find that https://t.co/X5pJH3owmT
When you can handle the ball and shoot with that range you goin to be able to create separation.. I can see the concern about finishing at the rim but his range and playmaking ability will impact his team immediately https://t.co/2lctaNW3pI
Yes I have and he does! Love his size at the PG.. but Tre Young is special, to be able to shoot the ball that well and that far of the dribble is Steph Curry esq!! And he leads the nation in assists https://t.co/7gb3YR7rpz
Love Ayton!! He went to my high school camp in San Diego a couple years ago.. I feel Elite PG are more valuable then elite Centers in this new NBA https://t.co/k8mkJ9PgHS
Why isn’t he the Number 1 pick??!!! It’s a new NBA right?? Want to shoot 3s, play more in the pick and roll and be able to create for others..who does that better then him?? https://t.co/sk1kdW4Q7v

On my way!!!! https://t.co/hjhmkizCcE
If a player doesn’t have a job it’s cuz he’s skills have diminished, he’s a locker room problem, or his style of play doesn’t fit their team/culture .. https://t.co/iCy5v0jfNZ
That comment is far from saying that organization is trash.. I love what Sean marks and coach Atkinson doing over there https://t.co/QaLryJ3Ak9
Never called the Nets trash! 😂 I almost went there instead of phx.. It was close https://t.co/2RTnEfUplz
Yes! We would respect it.. some do that! https://t.co/iuoYcotiZ1
Players cry and complain every play! Your never goin to stop that nor should you be able to if they don’t cussed at you.. Its about communication between refs vs players.. It’s a emotional/heated sport let players be human and not Tech so fast and admit when your wrong https://t.co/doami4FB7M
We just had a meeting with the NBA and NBPA personnel about this situation... Things have DEF changed I hope something can be done about this. https://t.co/P6vGOGtnEI
Your rep is everything.. only 8-10 guys can play so 5-7 can’t.. So every team needs vets esp if they can shoot( im career 40%)that can play when called upon but want take away from young guys or the team.. That why I’m here and will be for a couple more yrs at least https://t.co/I4LCyiCRAG
You want the short version or the long one? https://t.co/JKzwZoYnv5

No you can talk about whatever you want. Players, trust, locker room.. But when it come to people’s families has to have some boundaries https://t.co/iZNPlx0epk
I agree with that! https://t.co/v4tmTs2ljb
Dan I think Rick was talking about this certain case not you guys doing your job as a whole.. this is a very unique situation https://t.co/ucBAB622DN
I believe there was outrage at 1st but this has been a re occurring theme.. You know when doing interviews he’s goin to say outlandish things.. why not interview him everyday then? There has to be some sort of boundaries. Just my personal opinion https://t.co/qyvnH1Iql6
That’s why I have the perfect perspective.. I’m a player now, analyst in the summer and coach/GM for the future 😂😂 https://t.co/d8Lkpgom7O
Why so confused? I’m totally understand coming from a player perspective.. https://t.co/aso0YLmsLs
100% https://t.co/KroHB0wOua
No they def should.. Controversy sells I get it but where’s the line? A player father? A trainer? Come on now https://t.co/Uvs0jCK76v
They can ultimately do what they want.. But ESPN is a partner with the NBA so they could stop it.. Just think there should be a line.. https://t.co/114jG0ChW0
The problem is the player is not the one making the comments.. That’s the big difference.. The player is the one that know the temp of the team and what’s really goin on.. Don’t expect you to understand https://t.co/ro9kuKY0ud
Saw this earlier and wanted to comment on this. As a player and soon to be Coach/GM/Analyst I totally agree with Rick Carlisle.. Espn Fox or any other media outlet know better.. No reason to publish this interview or the controversial remarks https://t.co/WbCPINRsfm
Shout to @DBender03 that boi was on 🔥🔥 tonight.. Great team win!
Its weird seeing him out 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/aaFJjxdYhC
Much deserved!!!! Congrats @JohnWall https://t.co/Ux0cPxR3iF
Like the look for the 1’s better but sure looks comfortable https://t.co/YcsRNjSkdK
I agree the WNBA players deserve more! But the league should try new things to make the game even more entertaining to the public.. Lower the Rim to 9feet?? Boys and Girls even for our game love Dunks.. https://t.co/GamyywZjlx

Would love to see the league let min contract not put a team in the tax.. I just like seeing players stick with a team to have a chance to make a career for themselves https://t.co/UHxYA1w2R7
Everybody getting sick! That’s why I didn’t want to join the team! Finally feeling like myself again https://t.co/i0EhilXvjc
I agree.. But when a player like Pierce, Dirk,Kobe has won a chip and has played over a decade for that franchise nothing wrong for that man wanting his own night. Love IT and all he’s done for Boston hopefully they can work something out https://t.co/Dq4EURidCo
Even better then his finals MVP run when he guided them to a chip?? Or you don’t count playoffs as a season? https://t.co/dlAZV5M0YI
😂😂 I love it!! https://t.co/x6OViuZagr
One of the best shooting coaches in the country! @jimbrogan https://t.co/sqXg53YaNG

We get some more wins it’s goin to be pretty hard to keep this boi out the game!!! https://t.co/SmpHXE7u90
I’m not calling them trash I just think a player can complain esp if their not cursing or showing them up.. Can’t give techs for arguing the right way just cuz you don’t wanna hear it https://t.co/FOt1SZdsDI
The league really needs to start cracking down on these refs giving our ridiculous techs.. I’ve seen more bad techs vs players this season then any year in my career https://t.co/6meegXSSm5

No player should of got a T there.. https://t.co/ez5QkiOVtB
Oh ok! 😂 https://t.co/UM499AxMHN
So if a player in baseball argues with his coach and get suspended for a game they can cut you and you don’t get your money left on your contract??? I don’t think so!! https://t.co/Csczhj30Hz
Unless a player does something illegal/ against the law your guaranteed contract should never be able to get voided.. That’s ridiculous https://t.co/iXYlvtodoB
