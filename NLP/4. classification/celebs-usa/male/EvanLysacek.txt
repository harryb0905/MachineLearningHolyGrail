Look who I ran into. #sochi http://t.co/co2jCF5Wl7
@SummerSanders_ let's do it!!
@JeanetteJenkins @SummerSanders_ another easy thing to look for is 2 foot skating. The more times the skater is on 2 ft, the lower the score
@JeanetteJenkins @SummerSanders_ There are simple turns and complex turns... More complex turns= higher score.
@JeanetteJenkins @SummerSanders_ breaking down the component (presentation) score will give people more to look for than just jumps &amp; spins
@JeanetteJenkins @SummerSanders_ what the judges are looking for is so complex and so specific...
@SummerSanders_ @JeanetteJenkins Hope we can do a quick tutorial segment on @NBCOlympics @NBCSports before the mens final to break it down.
@Kateplusmy8 @Citi Thank You Kate. I hope you're well. Miss u too!!

Nailed the Before and After on Wheel of Fortune. "Curious George Washington Bridge" nice try Pat
@BreeezyJean Too Young to Kill on E! Obsessed!!! I've been it 3 times
@jtwill84 I think he peed when they announced his name. I would have liked him more if he had braces.
@jtwill84 she was out of control!!! I wanted a close up on her the whole show. Hope she gets the wildcard spot. I want more Rebecca!
@BreeezyJean Yes! They're perfect
@camber8 why does Rebecca blink 4000 times per minute?
@aquarianice85 it's on ABC
@elizabethdehoff high school edition sounds like magic
OMG!!! Is anyone else watching College Jeopardy?!?! It's perfection. Hearing them speak is like watching a baby bird learn to fly.
@onlineicerink I like Spurs a lot too.
The University Edition of Jeopardy is so awkward in the most entertaining way.
@tsiganichka Aren't many players I don't like in any sport. They're just different and I try to appreciate their approaches to the game.
@lilkringle The feather one has become my favorite. It has movement and is different than anyone else... I like the variation in textures
@tsiganichka I find his aggressive style of play inspirational. He's young and seems to be finding more restraint this season.
@onlineicerink both, and Farmar kills! And gotta love Lamar
@WhitesideUSAT great article today!!! I love your writing!
@just_anastasia I hate to fall. I'm all bone and muscle and it hurts when I fall! I have a rule of thumb. If blood is drawn, I call it a day

@regimus_prime Thank You and Thank You.
@Laura722 I am working so hard on that stupid quad! When I land it, it's easy, but when I fall it hurts so badly!
@saramariaj I see the skull as a sign of power, but i also think the natural sculptural quality of the skull is pretty cool.
@merrybari Thanks agreed. The gray made me look less tall than i am
@doublestop Thank you. That thing was so heavy!
