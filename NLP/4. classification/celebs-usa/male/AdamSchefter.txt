The most rushing yards the Saints allowed to a player in a game this season was 75 to Ezekiel Elliott. Saints are 3rd team to not allow a player to rush for more than 75 yards in any game that year. Others were 1999 Ravens (finished 8-8) and 1990 49ers (14-2, Lost NFC Champ).
Patriots went 3-5 on the road this season, which doesn't bode well for their chances today. Out of the 104 teams to reach the Super Bowl, only 2 of them (1.9%) had a losing record on the road in that regular season (2008 Cardinals, 2010 Packers).
Youth versus experience at QB today as Patrick Mahomes (23) faces Tom Brady (41), and Jared Goff (24) opposes Drew Brees (40). These QB matchups are the two largest age gaps in Conference Championship history. The past five games with largest disparity were won by the older QB.
Tom Brady‚Äôs last 16 PLAYOFF games, the equivalent of an NFL regular season: W-L                 12-4 Pass yds         5,284 TD-Int             32-14

Chiefs TE Travis Kelce‚Äôs 2019 base salary increases by $375,000 if he can catch two TDs today against the Raiders and get to 12 TD catches for the season. His 2019 base salary already escalated by $375,000 when he reached 1,200 receiving yards this season.
Ravens‚Äô S Eric Weddle has a $1 million incentive if he‚Äôs selected to the Pro Bowl, which he was, and if the Ravens make the postseason, which they can do with a win today against the Browns. $1 million on the line....

Eleven midseason NFL trade ideas, and why they make sense, via @billbarnwell. (Love NFL trades....)  https://t.co/E3Vr5J9lOy
Eagles at Giants tonight, and it should be noted: No team in the NFC East is currently above .500, all four teams have a negative point differential, and their combined win percentage (.368) is the worst of any division this season.  Not your father‚Äôs NFC East...
Close your eyes, defensive coaches and players...  Since the 1970 merger, this year has through five weeks the‚Ä¶ ‚Äì highest Comp Pct (65.0%) ‚Äì most Pass TD (275) ‚Äì highest TD Pct (4.8%) ‚Äì highest TD-Int ratio (1.95) ‚Äì highest pass attempts per team per game (36.6)
Rams‚Äô HC Sean McVay on Greg Zeuerlein: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably another week away. I thought Cairo (Santos) did a nice job last week....Last thing you want to do is rush rush them back where they could potentially have a setback. The confidence we have in Cario enables us to be patient.‚Äù

Chiefs vs. Rams, Nov. 19, Monday Night Football from Mexico City....
Steelers certainly could use Le‚ÄôVeon Bell. Steelers rank last in the NFL in rushing yards per game (43.3) and yards per rush (2.8) since Week 2, and their 19 rushing yards in Week 4 were their fewest in a game since 1970.
Pittsburgh still is expected to be interested in listening to trade offers for RB Le'Veon Bell, per league sources. Bell now planning to report later this month would not dissuade the Steelers from making a deal that made sense.
Now if Pittsburgh decides to use its transition tag on Le‚ÄôVeon Bell after this season, it would cost $11.3 million - less than the franchise tag put on him for this year. https://t.co/RvSL0cA2TB
Reporting week 7 would mean that Le'Veon Bell would miss games against the Falcons, then the Bengals, but be back in time to play the Browns Oct. 28 in Pittsburgh.

Redksins are signing WR Breshad Perriman, per source.
After trading for WR Josh Gordon and releasing WR Corey Coleman, the Patriots now have made 28 transactions involving a wide receiver since the start of the new league year in March.
Browns also spoke with Cowboys, Redskins, 49ers and others about a potential trade for Josh Gordon, and wanted to send him to NFC. But Patriots stepped in and closed.
Full compensation trade update: Patriots send Browns a 2019 fifth-round pick for WR Josh Gordon and get back a 2019 seventh-round pick if he is not active for 10 games, source tells ESPN. Trade was supposed to be for a 6th-round pick, but Patriots don't have a 6th.
New Patriots WR Josh Gordon is healthy enough from his strained hamstring to play Sunday vs. the Lions, per source.
And so the Patriots give up a 5th-round pick to get Josh Gordon and get back a late-round pick if he isn't active for 10 games, per sources.  Tom Brady has a new target.

Josh Gordon hurt his hamstring at a promotional shoot, not at practice, per source.
Teams already calling the Browns, who league sources believe are far more likely to trade Josh Gordon than release him.  Gordon is a vested vet and is not subject to waivers. So if he is cut, he is a free agent and can sign where he wants, for what he wants.  A lot at stake.
Browns GM John Dorsey: ‚ÄúFor the past six years, the Browns have fully supported and invested in Josh, both personally and professionally and wanted the best for him, but unfortunately we‚Äôve reached a point where we feel it‚Äôs best to part ways and move forward. We wish Josh well.‚Äù

The most an NFL team has surrendered for a defensive player is when Vikings traded a 1, two 3‚Äôs and a swap of 5‚Äôs to Chiefs for DE Jared Allen. Bears trade for Khalil Mack, when it gets done, will top that, making it the most an NFL team has surrendered for a defensive player.

There‚Äôs also a belief around the league that, unless he gets a new deal or trade, Seahawks‚Äô safety Earl Thomas is preparing to sit out through training camp and into the regular season.
Interesting fact of day: Jon Gruden and Oakland DE Khalil Mack have not spoken once since the Raiders hired their new head coach in January. No contact between two men who should be vital this season for the Raiders.
There is a belief from some around the league that, no matter the fines or the effect on his free agency, Aaron Donald will not play another down on his existing contract. In other words, his holdout is likely to last until a new deal comes along.
So instead of being fined $40,000 a day for missing Camp, Falcons‚Äô Pro-Bowl WR Julio Jones will get a sweetened deal in 2018. Deadlines, and Falcons‚Äô owner Arthur Blank, spur action.
Three more NFL teams - Lions, Jets, Raiders - report to training camp today.   Only teams that still haven‚Äôt reported to camp are Cardinals, Vikings, Broncos and Chargers. It‚Äôs go time.

Just to clarify:  Steelers' offer to Le'Veon Bell last year averaged $13.3 million per year. Steelers' offer to him this year averaged $15 million per year.  But Bell does not believe he should be paid as a RB; he believes he should be paid as an elite offensive weapon.

With his Steelers' career expected to come to an end after this season, Le'Veon Bell should be the marquee free agent in the Class of 2019.
From Le'Veon Bell's agent Adisa Bakari: "His intention was to retire as a Steeler. But now that there's no deal, the practical reality is, this now likely will Le'Veon's last season as a Steeler."  More: "It became clear the Steelers wanted to pay the position, not the player."
No deal for Steelers and RB Le'Veon Bell. No deal for Cowboys and DeMarcus Lawrence. No deal for Lions and Ziggy Ansah. No deal for Rams and Lamarcus Joyner.  A dud of a deadline day.  But the Free Agent Class of 2019 just got stronger.
For Steelers and Le‚ÄôVeon Bell to beat today‚Äôs franchise deadline, they must submit the following to the NFL office prior to 4:00 p.m. ET:  i) a net message reporting the signing; (ii) an ECRS form; and (iii) a .pdf or fax copy of the contract signed by the club and player.

Despite Mike Tomlin‚Äôs confidence that a deal can be struck by 4 p.m. Monday, it will be challenging for Pittsburgh and Steelers‚Äô franchised RB Le‚ÄôVeon Bell to reach a long-term contract agreement, per league sources. The two sides came close last year and will keep trying Monday.
Dallas and Cowboys‚Äô franchised DE DeMarcus Lawrence are unlikely to reach a deal by Monday‚Äôs 4 p.m. ET deadline to sign franchise players, per sources. If no deal, Lawrence would be scheduled to become a free agent after this season.
No long-term deal is expected between Los Angeles and Rams‚Äô franchised S Lamarcus Joyner by Monday‚Äôs 4 pm ET deadline, though the two sides continue talking, per league sources. If no deal, Joyner would be scheduled to become a free agent after this season.
Detroit and Lions‚Äô franchised DE Ziggy Ansah will not reach a deal by Monday‚Äôs 4 p.m. ET deadline to sign franchise players, per league sources. Ansah‚Äôs contract will expire after this season, and he will be scheduled to become a free agent.
