I am not blaming Billy just mentioning if I was the coach what I would have done. Billy is a great coach by the way
@caseyw25 I'm sure his +- is good
Westbrook had a great flow to the game but now his rhythm is off due to lineups and sub pattern at the end of 3rd quarter
I love my rockets but like this series enough to see them play 2 more games. Lol
As a Point Guard when your team ain't getting it done your mentality switch to " do it myself"
Westbrook should've played every minute in the 2nd. It's win or go home. The beginning of the 4th hurt OKC
I believe in experience when the game is on the line but leaving a guy on the bench with ton of experience is CRaZY to me
Lineup is crazy for OKC. Put @TajGibson22 in the DAMN game
Billy Donovan needs to play @TajGibson22 if he wants to win this game

@adsnmd congrats on Austin scholarship. Look forward to watching him next season
@Eric__Smith how u been
I see many college players not using the P&amp;R efficiently - turn the corner to put pressure on the BIGMAN to create offensive options
@Eric__Smith it would make sense to just get the ball inbounds. I would try to score quick
@Eric__Smith have to allow it because nba does.

Wow! Bad foul
That's a bad call. Should be and1
Izzo will make his adjustment to create easier basket by starting to get defense pressure
Louisville is executing the gameplan  of Michigan State making it very difficult for valentine to create offense for his team
