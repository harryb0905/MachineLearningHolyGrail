I think all thongs are "interestingly" uncomfortable and hilarious. #askmagicmike
RT @@tntcf44:¬†@channingtatum¬†so was the thong uncomfortable¬†#askmagicmike
It's depends on what I'm dancing to. It's a hard question, because I don't have specific moves. I just freestyle. #askmagicmike
RT @FSHeartsNCarter: @channingtatum #askmagicmike ¬†Hii Channing, what is your favorite dance move &amp; why?
I would love to to do another film with @McConaughey &amp; @joemanganiello as soon as possible. Both are incredible actors &amp; great human beings.
