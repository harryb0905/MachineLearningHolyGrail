And I said "I know this is gonna sound crazy bro...like soo off the wall...so simple that it may sound odd to you...but ....uhhhh....just put it out" 🤷🏾‍♂️
Got a another homie who is into music and did all this prep...hit me and said "I got it ready...its sequenced..mixed and mastered...Im ready for the world to hear it I just dont know what to do next...
@naima The process leading up to isnt always ...the pay off is. I made something that people only want from me...in hip hop thats rare? Im thankful for that.

@iamMICK Network with your peers
If anyone knows  L Boogie from Jersey if she’s on social media @ her. Last time I saw her she was working for @IAMQUEENLATIFAH ....she looked out for me on 9/11 and I want her to know Im super thankful for that ride that day.
I think L Boogie works with @queenlatifah now, I never got to tell her thank you for that ride. I’ve never told this story but thats what happened to me on 9/11. I made it back to VA the next day. https://t.co/8aWSFMOjs6
! I think L Boogie was her asst. or The Nanny. Im in a Burgundy Bentley ( first time ever) riding uptown with Kimora Lee Simmons &amp; L Boogie. They took me uptown and dropped me off and said “Dont do back downtown until its safe” and thats what I did. https://t.co/an2ZxRNQKm
It was dis girl I know from Jersey named L Boogie ( Not Lauryn Hill) she said they had room I could ride. I didnt even know where we were going! I get in the bk seat &amp; @kimoraleesimmons is in da front seat with @unclerush on speaker phone and he’s telling her head Uptown Kimora”! https://t.co/C2gJfg4PWU
I’m just walking around NY like a episode of The Walking Dead. I saw @uluz3 doing the same thing ..we all just wanted to get home. I was standing infront of the hotel and a burgungy 4 door Bentley Azzure pulled up and someone said “You good Skillz?” https://t.co/9NboFofM24
His eyes lit up and he raised his voice at me and said “I dont give a fuck about that chain the world finna end bitch” 😳😳😳 Not even in a a disrespectful way. Pharell used that word alot back in the day when he was excited. we split up...
He was making all kinds of calls, we started walking. Im thinking “shit...if he gettin outta NY Im going with him”!r No luck, we were stuck. He left everything he had in his room! I remember saying “you left ya chain in te room”?!
Woke up the next morning to take the Amtrak back to VA and cut on the TV &amp; saw the World Trade Center on fire. Everything had stopped, no trains, planes and the tunnels were blocked. I was trapped in New York City. Went downstairs to the lobby and saw @pharrell panicking. https://t.co/XTYIE1x8GV
Sept 10th 2001 I’ll never forget it. I was onstage at MSG with @missymisdemeanorelliott ..for a brief moment earlier that day I met Michael Jackson. How can you ever forget the day you met MJ?

@michaeljunior60 Yes
I knew I couldnt pay @questlove his regular rate for Hold Tight, he actually didnt charge me anything, he gave me the beat. #MDBP10
The hooks for Crazy World, So Far So Good,  Yea ya Know It &amp; Hold Tight were all written by @DICERAW
The name that I bleeped out in “Hip Hop Died” was actually Miles Davis.  #MDBP10

Pretty much 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/L5zLgnIStb
@SpankHorton Spank stop goin back and forth wit these fools bro lol
@naima Nah we gotta see that lol...
“I got you stuck off the realness......” - DONE. RIGHT THERE. YOU WERE LOCKED IN . Dont @ me
When mase said “I was murder...P Diddy named me pretty, I did it for the money now can you get with me” summed up his whole career in two bars lol
“There’s a war going on outside no man is safe from....you can run ...but you cant hide forever” -
Prodigy ( RIP) had some of the best two bar intros on songs EVER known to man. Dont @ me
“What must I go thru to show you $hit is real...and I aint never really have a f$-k how ni&amp;&amp;as feel” —Fam?? Those two bars alone had me stuck 😳😳😳😳
I used to love hearing the first two bars of a MC’s verse and automatically knowing his viewpoint and where that verse was headed. Like cats who kept it real simple but dope.
“ I write raps...and when ni$$as bite I clap....cuz they shit sound better now....”
“The employees of the year yea we’re back to work...I took time off while other rappers got jerked”
“Ayooooo Dizzy Gillespie plays a saaaaaxxxxx”......
“I got question...its serious as cancer..who can keep the average dancer....” #whosaidit
“I bought a band ...Sam is on Trombone...he’s blowing hard..back to back notes...” #whosaidit

As fans of music and culture we hold onto to memories and moments from the past but we have to accept that things are different now. Some of its gonna be dope and some of its gonna be wack. It is what it is.

@carlchery Oh it happened. Lol
@HCheadle @VICE @RickPaulas Sounds like he just got older and angrier in my opinion 🤷🏾‍♂️
@N_A_2991_ His catalog is insane. He’s still relevant ( not for raps) and he never changed who he was. Who else can do the brekafast club, the price is right, the view, the hockey awards, summer jam, jimmly fallon and go smoke wit the homies in the same day?
@JCrossover Dude talkin like Snoop is on TV doin sumn else other then being Snoop lol
@JCrossover Same to you bro! Big fan
@N_A_2991_ Nope.
@JCrossover I dont know another rapper than can cover the ground that Snoop has w/o losing credibility and not changing who he is. 🤷🏾‍♂️

@Mrs24kGolden Yea we do. Not saying that at all. None of those songs have the staying power of G Thang , Gin &amp; Juice, Next Episode or Whats my Name tho.
Facts! https://t.co/aXoxGkitbC
@Mrs24kGolden When I say songs I mean “songs people know YOU for” Ye aint goin nowhere in the world and performin the song he did with Paul.  Lol
@Mrs24kGolden Ye cant cover the ground Snoop can cover. Ppl may listen to him, but his persona isnt as likeable as Snoop’s. Snoop doesnt piss off anyone lol
@Mrs24kGolden I feel you. But back to my original point, Ye’s catalog doesnt hold a candle to Snoop’s and Im still considering the fact that Snoop’s last hit was Drop It Like Its Hot. 🤷🏾‍♂️
@Mrs24kGolden You might look at him as the hip hop unc because he’s gotten older &amp; not known as much for his music in 2018 but your grandma knows who snoop dog is. I dont know another rapper who can cover that kind of ground.
@Mrs24kGolden The View, the Price is right, a soap opera, go coach a football game, the hockey awards, the bet awards then go do jimmy fallon all in the same day &amp; smoke blunts all day and no one has a problem wit it.
@Mrs24kGolden My point is the music he created early still holds him over to this day. And his celebrity is unmatched. I dont know another rapper who can do the breakfast club..
@buzzard74 Not at all. Way too much to type.  He still can perform songs he made in 92 bruh. And whats crazy is? Thats not even his song 🤷🏾‍♂️
@Mrs24kGolden How many times have you recited Nutn But a G Thang in your life?
@Mrs24kGolden @_ShamGod @naima Bruh....Snoop has the best catalog in hip hip, period.
@_ShamGod @naima Dont change the fact that he has the best catalog in hip hop and no rapper can cover the ground he has covered and still be himself. 🤷🏾‍♂️

@iknowfranchise Im sayin I know. I’m talking about the remix though, they edited out big
Like who tf plays “Only you” by 112 and plays the one without BIGGIE?? https://t.co/1WdOrXgVcg
