@dan_klobucar I think it was more like 4 or 5. (But we were first.)
@KyleTucker_ATH Just wait until the oral history of this tweet exchange.
Today alone, I have seen three different oral histories of "Office Space." And I love Office Space, but ...  Can we all just get together and call a truce on oral histories?
Great details in here on the Pac-12's unusual investment proposal, and something you don't see very often -- quotes from people defending Larry Scott. https://t.co/8FTZ45bBz3
@JonathanLingo If that's the case then a whole bunch of media companies are violating the independent contractor requirement.
@JonathanLingo That doesn't make any sense.

@38Godfrey Brother.
Crowdsourcing research: What's the last program to hire 7 new assistants in one offseason without a head-coaching change?
@bamaphiliac 22 coaches in 8 years = about 1.5 jobs per year turning over. Last 2 years: 6 and 7. Big difference.

@wilnerhotline In case you were wondering (like me), Pursuit Channel "is an American television network that airs programming geared to hunting, fishing, shooting and outdoor recreation." (Per Wikipedia)
@ClayTravis And that's without including the costs for the schools to buy back their Tier 3 rights.

@shawnwatson1985 Well he gave the quote after they called him up and told him the accusation. The question is whether it should have even gotten that far.

Mizzou's AD: "The Committee on Infractions has abused its discretion in applying penalties." https://t.co/XTQzxko08R
In its report, the Committee on Infractions directly addresses the difference between Mizzou and UNC's cases, which is, essentially, Mizzou admitted to there being fraud and UNC did not. https://t.co/QZfxIslGC5
It kind of looks like the NCAA was so mad at UNC it decided to hammer Mizzou. That's quite the punishment for 12 kids over 3 sports.

I’m here for an Alabama staff with Sark, Butch and Kyle Flood. https://t.co/VeoozLH09D
Last month, Jalen Hurts faced Oklahoma in the Playoff. Now, he’s a Sooner who may well play Alabama.   Welcome to college football’s dizzying new version of free agency.  https://t.co/DyWLEMkO3f
Cam came from juco, barely played at Florida. Not a comparable situation IMO. https://t.co/dt2vOva0yz
Thanks to @TheAthleticCFB group chat for helping me on this analogy. https://t.co/f6djdQuAFa
Jalen Hurts' dad correctly predicted his son would become the biggest free agent in college football history.  My column on the magnitude of Hurts choosing Oklahoma. https://t.co/DyWLEMkO3f
Will Jim Harbaugh really cede control of his offense?  Did West Virginia make the best hire of the coaching carousel?  What would this year's bowl lineup have looked like 30 years ago?  This week's Mailbag. https://t.co/TN7ij0xW6N
I grew up listening to Marty and Joe every day and night, waiting of course to hear "And this one belongs to the Reds."  What a career. https://t.co/2og4vlq8Xe

I guess I didn't realize Sark "is still viewed as a scapegoat for the 35-31 loss to Clemson." As I recall his last play-call was a 30-yard Jalen Hurts TD run to take the lead. https://t.co/OSfQ5J79DB
Well that’s telling. https://t.co/lOgFkQOcXA
@joeslide No, he was delving into college football. And cheeseburgers.

@GuyTyping I can’t believe you put this picture in my mentions. Gr-oss.
Dabo closes out his White House speech by reading passages from the late Tyler Trent's Indy Star essay. Awesome.

@LindseyThiry Sounds delicious
How does Kyler Murray's skill set translate to the NFL? @dpbrugler, who had him No. 15 in latest mock draft, sizes up the film.  https://t.co/rRMJDs12pl
“I’ve always felt like I could play in the NFL. I’m a confident guy."  Here's what I wrote about Kyler Murray 2 days before the Orange Bowl, when it started becoming apparent he was leaning toward football.  https://t.co/kQmQjupA2p

Jeez, Jalen Hurts lost and he’s getting steak. https://t.co/4FHVozwn3M
I love the idea of Jalen Hurts at the U. QB was Richt’s downfall. Would be at least one reason to watch non-Clemson ACC football next year.

One of my favorite people in all of sports media is @PSchrags. Fantastic to hear him on the sidelines of a divisional playoff game.
@rbl1973 It's crazy. Almost like they're different sports.
@benhailey85 The purpose is to crown a champion. Or have I had it wrong this whole time?
@dotchowderhead And it never will be with 130 teams playing vastly different schedules.
Roughly half of Twitter was saying this on Dec. 29. https://t.co/cWnz2BUg8L
So the NFL has a bigger playoff, no selection committee and STILL blowouts??  We’ll get this right someday, people.
@LindseyThiry That's awesome.
And his week started in California. https://t.co/t1QPFSOMzK
@STB_Pod He was in California on Monday if you recall. And reportedly Miami tomorrow.
Jalen Hurts is attempting to see at least 40 percent of the country in one week. https://t.co/AXXU5R3nqE
Only one problem: The Rose Bowl’s never bid on it. https://t.co/I3bR5dN2R2
@GoDawgs1712 @DustyGerald @BruceFeldmanCFB Oh we will.
⁦so, ⁦@BruceFeldmanCFB⁩ took a ride through the Transfer Portal today and made some interesting discoveries.  https://t.co/R3IVty0t4y
@jayfurr I’d be fine living there but do I have to work for nick Saban?
@Aintropy We did that for 16 years and people hated it.
What do you think’s waiting when you come out the other side of the transfer portal?
Interesting. https://t.co/wZHihdJQIS
Oh I'm just getting started. https://t.co/oukORsUVpt
People can't get enough of that portal. https://t.co/U00ScQMZ6f
A tale of two dynasties.  Clemson has 5 guys who've been on-field assistants since at least 2012, 7 since 2014.  Alabama has 1 left (Tosh) from 2016 staff.
This was a fun story to work on last year. And it’s newly relevant now. https://t.co/ktABvYKFbY
Last one left in the Alabama offensive staff room, please turn out the lights. https://t.co/mM9u1rP4M6
And it’s everything you hoped it would be. https://t.co/DBSDi64x8t
@WishartG1981 I don't root for anyone/anything to fail. Bad karma. Hope it works out.
Seems more like a circle. https://t.co/AdvIFcIni5
So Dantonio's solution for fixing an atrocious offense is to keep the same exact staff and just swap their positions? https://t.co/n1PeKjZSC6
The news got quietly buried Monday, but “everything is on the table” regarding changes to the Playoff. @NicoleAuerbach⁩ and I examined the state of the CFP. https://t.co/uamkwwDy43
Saban had six assistant changes last year and is up to at least four this year. https://t.co/wsPSg4P4it
Interesting nugget from @paulsen_smw on the CFP title game's lower TV rating. Clearly, this is a big, big problem.  https://t.co/TIYwSGJsU2 https://t.co/1vqB25EQVo
Don't know yet, it's still relatively new, but yes, theoretically a guy could just feel out interest but decide to stay. https://t.co/7s2wljw9L0
What happens if Martell transfers but Fields doesn't get his waiver?   Hence, complex. https://t.co/KFms4BjFpg
I would concur with others that "transfer portal" sounds very sci-fi and makes it sound like kids are porting into space.
Ohio State's QB situation just got a lot more complex. https://t.co/dikcnLhoEb
On Monday, CFP leaders said “everything is on the table” re: playoff expansion discussions. Here’s me and ⁦@NicoleAuerbach⁩ on where things stand.  https://t.co/uamkwwDy43
Do it! https://t.co/ib8L3JiJTi
Had a feeling that was coming ... https://t.co/jrXRMD35Qt
Where do this year's Clemson &amp; Alabama teams rank among the 20 all-time CFP participants?  Is there another "little 'ol Clemson" out there poised to rise up?  And of course, we must address whether Saban's lost it.  Mailbag. https://t.co/iV0fgbMMPC
Let the games begin. https://t.co/FS6Ne63T8A
Somehow Jim Chaney became the Kliff Kingsbury of the SEC. https://t.co/JpRT6lQCKZ
@kmasterman @NCAA @TheAthleticCFB That would add up to thousands fewer athletes having the opportunity to attend college on scholarship. Not advisable.
Our man @jdubs88 with a thorough and blunt review of ESPN's national championship broadcast. https://t.co/mxamSqRatm
Is the next Clemson quietly lurking right now? Should the CFP pick a permanent title game site? How to assess Ryan Day's first month at OSU.  This week's Mailbag: https://t.co/iV0fgbMMPC
This week’s Mailbag: A reader asked me to rank all 20 teams so far from the CFP era. Sounded like fun! https://t.co/iV0fgbMMPC
There are few matchups more one- sided than coaches’ agents vs. schools. https://t.co/emacVbzzwd
@24CaliGal It was based on him being there.
Given how far, how expensive, etc, the atmosphere definitely exceeded my expectations. https://t.co/rG21Dfz8yc
"Awful?" I'd be curious to hear from Clemson &amp; Bama fans who attended whether they agree. https://t.co/83n00RWaia
Poor Clay Helton. What's the magic answer now? https://t.co/4bPzR6V5U5
Craziest thing about my early Top 25? Texas A&amp;M plays four of the top five. https://t.co/rJu0UrPJlp
Indeed. I think they should have to play Texas next week just to be sure. https://t.co/znxam81lCQ
Probably b/c 3 of those 4 did win their bowl games, all vs. Top 10 teams, as well as Kentucky vs. No. 12. https://t.co/BcZXJ6UXeJ
I would echo everything Bryan said (they don't control the weather or the score). Congrats as well to the host committee, led by @PLErnstrom and the 49ers' staff. https://t.co/eh0xaZiWYI
You may not want to hear it, but the SEC is going to be very good next season.   But so is the Big Ten West!  My early 2019 Top 25. https://t.co/rJu0UrPJlp

You name the recent Clemson star ... Tajh Boyd, Deshaun, CJ Spiller, Vic Beasley ... they’re here on the field celebrating. Deshaun taking pics with anyone who comes up to him.
Dabo (and John Swofford) https://t.co/KHNAWG0Ujc
It's Jalen time.
This game makes a compelling argument to rid box scores of the outdated total yards stat forever. https://t.co/CiVZOTMpjW
This is just plain one of the most out of nowhere things I've ever seen.
Is Notre Dame off the hook now or nah?
Trevor Lawrence, true freshman, national title game vs. Alabama: 18-of-28 for 347 yards, three TDs and 0 INTs.
Justyn Ross following up his breakout game vs. ND with an absolute clinic vs. Alabama. Not a bad way to end your freshman year.
Worth noting: Alabama has never lost a game by more than 14 points under Nick Saban.
An Alabama defense allowing 8.8 yards per play is something.
They got the cart for Savion Smith. Being driven off now.
In other news, Clemson is winning by three TDs.
That looks like a bad, bad injury for Savion Smith, the CB on that TD pass. You could tell as soon as he hit the turf.
Agree to disagree. https://t.co/o9OLHuWIS3
While you all watch Imagine Dragons, we're about to get treated to Alabama's Million Dollar Band in the stadium.
HALFTIME: Clemson 31, Alabama 16.  Didn't see that coming. Credit to Lawrence, Etienne, that O-line and Trayvon Mullen (INT &amp; a sack)
Nick Saban is going to break 15 head set at halftime at the rate Alabama is racking up dumb penalties.
Clemson O-line has been outstanding. And they were a concern coming in. https://t.co/X8TnPiLYtk
Clemson's play-calling has been superb. Alabama's D on its heels.   And of course, Travis Etienne is a beast.   Clemson 28, Alabama 16 4:38 2Q.
Clemson now has TD drives of:  4 plays, 75 yards 6 plays, 65 yards  Clemson 21, Alabama 16
Heck of a play by Austin Bryant denying that shovel pass. Alabama up 16-14 after:  -- giving up a pick-six -- missing a PAT -- settling for a FG after getting to the 1.
That was only the first quarter?? Man. Catch your breath, everybody.
It is, without question, the single biggest flaw of 2018 Alabama.  That was its NINTH missed PAT.
Every time Najee Harris runs I think he's going to flatten the entire defense. Powerful runner. Backup.
There have already been more TDs in the first five minutes of this game (three) than the two most recent college games at Levi's (Washington 10, Utah 3 and Oregon 7, MSU 6.)
Two 62-yard passes in the first five minutes. This is fun.
Someone rebooted Tua during the commercial break.
Well that's a departure from the script. Tua pick six on the first series. Clemson CB AJ Terrell jumped it. 7-0 Tigers.
95 percent? There are empty rows scattered throughout the stadium but pretty good crowd in the end. https://t.co/zgmDOxjKAF
Update: Clemson's got at least 60 percent of the stadium. Very impressive.
Look who’s back at the 49ers stadium. https://t.co/RLyK5aRkV3
It’s still 45 minutes until kickoff but Clemson fans are out in force. The stands are already at least half orange.

The sidelines at this thing are often a who’s who of recent Bama stars. Hello, Mr. Howard. https://t.co/OB6D181AX0
People keep asking me about the condition of the turf, so, here it is. https://t.co/OR8ImRWpQA
Fortunately the end zones didn’t get much use. https://t.co/TMJU3rLxFl
Seen inside Levi's Stadium. https://t.co/HsNS86W4vr
Just a little bit different end zones than the Redbox Bowl. https://t.co/16hmE5IC4w
On the media shuttle to the game. Just passed an apartment complex we lived in when we first moved west. And it is very, very surreal to see Alabama and Clemson car flags in Santa Clara, California.
Theee hours before kickoff, one last ticket update.   Get-in price, once down to $125, now up to $216, lower corners once below $400 now up to $550. Late demand good sign for organizers.
Keenum: "We as a conference (the SEC) have not had a discussion about expansion of the current playoff amongst ourselves. And I would be surprised if any of the other conferences have had in-depth discussions about the impact of changes."
More quotes from CFP Board chair Mark Keenum earlier today re: playoff format. "Everything is on the table. We’re going to look at every aspect of how we can make our playoff system even better.”
The message from Keenum is, we haven’t had a chance to talk about this amongst our confrences. We need more time.   But again, both he and Hancock specially said that nothing is off the table.
Now we are interviewing Mark Keenum, and he did not rule out 8-team playoff. “We are going to look at everything” in terms of improving the playoff.   Today’s statement appears directed more at ramping down expectations.
More Keenum: “If a decision were to be made down the road (about expansion), the Presidents would be the ones to make it and we are not there.”
CFP meetings just broke up. Mississippi St president Mark Keenum (chair of CFP board of managers): “it’s fair to say speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what presidents and commissioners have discussed.”
Looks good to me. https://t.co/s2yMEQLRAN
Michigan fans: Urban's gone, it's Ryan Day now, here's our window.  Ryan Day: Thanks, I'm taking your renowned defensive coach. https://t.co/2IXALKD7FK
He had one heck of a season and could be first QB drafted. https://t.co/YdztWDy2wX
@Macgeniuss And the other 20% include Tua and Trevor Lawrence.
This is what we mean by “This is not the same Alabama Clemson game “ https://t.co/DH6iR60I1g
Good news: The bad weather has cleared. No rain today or tonight.  Bad news: People with experience playing on the Levi’s field very concerned how it will hold up after this weekend’s deluge.

@DavidAnderson_ Then I guess you don’t like college football that much. Which is fine.
This morning i wrote about the record-low ticket prices here. https://t.co/ju63vYwcTb  So worth noting they're now rising up closer to 2015. https://t.co/5CHdgTK5bR
John Swofford: "I'm very open to having the conversation about any kind of changes that might make the Playoff better. ... I can't tell you that we as a conference are ready to push for expanding the playoff bc there are a lot of questions about the implications" to all of CFB.
I asked Greg Sankey what he expects to come out of tomorrow's meetings. "The acknowledgment that a four-team playoff has worked exceptionally well."
John Swofford: “I don’t expect dramatic news to come out of tomorrow’s meetings” of CFP commissioners and presidents.
Saban smile. https://t.co/VjNnaIrFgy
Dabo says if Bama-Clemson IV isn't good for CFB then we should just go back to the old bowl system and "elect" someone national champion in the 2 polls.
Dabo: "I'm not going to apologize for having a great team and a great program, and neither is coach Saban .. if that's not what's best for college football, why are we even doing it?"
At one point this week you could buy national championship tickets for less than the Citrus Bowl.  How a perfect storm led to record low prices for Alabama-Clemson in Santa Clara. https://t.co/ju63vYwcTb
You know you're at the national championship game when somebody's band is playing Seven Nation Army outside your hotel window.
It would be awesome if they scrimmaged Stanford while they’re there. Just for the heck of it. https://t.co/n59Y457xa7
One last reminder: If you are in or near San Jose, @BruceFeldmanCFB and I will be at Playoff Fan Central at 2 pm. Come say hi and talk to football.

There are going to be a whole lot of draft prospects on the field for Alabama-Clemson Monday night. @dpbrugler ranks the Top 25. https://t.co/6w1aBhj0mm
@skbuckeyefan The bigger you make the field, the more margin for error for teams like Alabama and Clemson. Years where they might have missed, now they're in, and once there they can win it all.  For example, Pete Carroll USC might have won 4 national titles if there'd been an 8 team field.
@mitchusson @dmm12345 They could figure it out in five minutes if they wanted to. So far there hasn’t been a glaring impetus.
@chrisbogen Or, the rest of the college football world could beat them and get their turn.
@skbuckeyefan Probably more.
@Matt_Fortuna What a beaut
All I know is the last three national title games were decided by 5, 4 and 3 points, the last two on last-second TDs.  But judging from Twitter, the whole thing is just awful.
More schools from more parts of the country would get to say they were a playoff team.  Same number or fewer would win national titles. https://t.co/cuN4pxFz8W
@mitchusson No, it means the same few schools will each the title game more often. Perhaps even more so at 8.
Well then somebody needs to beat them. ... Or should we use the old Big Ten no-repeat Rose Bowl rule? https://t.co/JAD1F6ax29
Not gonna lie, that '95 field warms my heart. https://t.co/5estv8ia9j
@gmraynor @AnnaH247 Welcome!
@F_HBC ESPN didn't pick the location. That's on the CFP. Date/time same it's been all along.
People thought expanding the playoff would open it up the national title race to more teams, but in some ways it just gives the most loaded programs even more opportunities.
Here's something to ponder: If there had been a 4-team playoff in the '90s, how many years in a row would Florida State have played in it? Or USC under Carroll?
NOW, if Hunter Renfrow himself is fatigued by Alabama-Clemson we've got a problem.
It's not the same movie! I think the only character that's been in all three is Hunter Renfrow. https://t.co/jgytI2W2cg
Also, I think I'm going to end this restaurant metaphor after two tweets.
Who is the other five-star restaurant in CFB this year that I'm unaware of? https://t.co/4UQRTsBPSN
You know, the last two times I ate at this five-star restaurant it was amazing. But now I'm fatigued by it and would rather go to McDonald's.
The strangest thing about Alabama-Clemson "fatigue" is their previous two title games were GREAT. But no, let's not have anymore of that.
All I heard going in last year was "I'm not going to watch two SEC teams." And then it was a classic and 28 million people watched it. https://t.co/XXiAkJdNmm
I don't think it's a stretch to say this is the best national title matchup since Texas-USC. Whether the game lives up to it, who knows, but don't take for granted how rare something like this is just b/c they've played before.
There has never been an FBS game between two 14-0 teams. Tua vs. Trevor. NFL players at almost every position.  The word "fatigue" should not be mentioned anywhere near this game. https://t.co/1EXMoDzebp

Is Chris Petersen actually underachieving at Washington? How much does Holgorsen boost Houston's profile? What's next for UCF?  Mailbag: https://t.co/jDU7neLFUr
@DanWolken I don't think it has to stick to the BCS venues. Tampa two years ago was Final Four-esque. The question is whether it's feasible to come West.

@NebGradDubDub I heard the same thing last yr about Alabama-Georgia and it got a monstrous rating. If it's a great game, people watch.

@adamamin @2ndTake1 You're only saying that b/c the Bennigan's across the street closed last year.
I don't know about that. The TV rating's going to be massive.  I think it's more the $1,200 flights and $600 hotel rooms. https://t.co/cScm6ilJzb

I love when people on Twitter decide what's meaningful or not meaningful on behalf of the people actually playing. https://t.co/v9xY80vqtl
“This season’s non-semifinal New Year’s Six bowls averaged 11.6 million viewers, the best ever in the five years of the system.”  But, “nobody cares!”
One “meaningless” bowl had nearly identical viewership (16.7M) to one of the semifinals (16.8). https://t.co/8dSxuKC9Hu

Where do you rank Ohio State now that its season is over? What of ND after the Cotton Bowl blowout? Texas after its big win?  My Top 10: https://t.co/M0V7eJ5Uff
@mattpoulsen Well, for example, Ohio State’s loss to Purdue proved one of the most important games of the season. With auto champs it would have no impact.  Ditto Alabama Georgia and many more.
@danheitz @BarrettSallee His do you have tiebreakers between teams that might have no common opponents?
@andrew_kalman If you’re saying we need teams because the committee can’t get the four best right, everyone but Ohio State losing does not help the cause.
@mattpoulsen Not for me. I’m on the fence about it because it would devalue the best regular season in sports.
The old “plus one” concept. Discussed for a decade or so. Never gained traction.  I’d like it. I think most would hate it. https://t.co/3qNYxnDxDu
Speaking of arguments ... I did an almost-final Top 10 after yesterday’s games. Only thing that could change is order of 1-2.  https://t.co/M0V7eJ5Uff
The most valid argument for an 8-team playoff IMO is that right now it’s not a national tournament. If you feel the West Coast, Midwest and G5 should always be represented, then I see why you’d expand.  But as @BarrettSallee aptly says, that’s prioritizing access over excellence
You change if there’s a pressing reason to change. “The semis weren’t entertaining enough” does not qualify in my book. https://t.co/8uK9KnRTsR
This has been the most misunderstood tweet I’ve ever sent.   Things are almost EXACTLY as they seem. The two best teams were already in the playoff. A bigger field (this year) would have accomplished next to nothing. (Maybe Ohio State wins a game.) https://t.co/NDkMFLg6YI
@2WheelsRMan We have an entire season full of storylines. I don’t see that as a reason to cram in an extra round.  The more pressing impetus would be trying to make it a truly national tournament
In five years, I've yet to come out of bowl season thinking a team that didn't make the playoff would have won the playoff. https://t.co/hAovp4Ebux

There's one CFB game left, but the rest of bowl season is over.  Here's my (almost) final Top 10: https://t.co/M0V7eJnvDP
What a beautiful tribute, @notthefakeSVP. #TylerStrong
OK, enough bickering everybody.  Today was an absolutely delightful way to spend New Year's. Appreciate it. Six days 'til Clemson-Bama.
Congrats, C-USA! https://t.co/akS54B73Zk
That's a mighty big win for the Longhorns.   Ten wins, two against the final Top 5 (OU and UGA).
How do teams decide which support staffer's job is to escort ejected players to the locker room?
Wrong about the entire Top 10??   Maybe it's just that we had 2 teams that were way better than everyone else this year. https://t.co/D05QuqBnBa
Yes. The same team that's going to win it in a 4-team playoff. https://t.co/ezWc20xQTT
This bowl season about to see losses by the committee's No. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 teams.  Not exactly the strongest argument for an 8-team playoff.

Tyler was one of the most memorable people of this entire football season, and certainly the most inspiring. https://t.co/1xks8qZKWH
Urban Meyer looks pretty darn happy. If that's really his last game as a coach, winning the Rose Bowl is a great way to go out.
It may be too little, too late, but love the fight we're seeing from Washington.
The Sugar Bowl nearly turned into the Running of the Bulls.
Holy hell! https://t.co/zHco7KkIsD
There you go, Huskies. A touchdown and a tribute to Urban Meyer in one play.
@MichaelPressler OK.
You can argue OU if you want, but   I never saw ND give up 49 to a Purdue or 51 to a Maryland. ... Buckeyes are right where they belong, enjoy it. https://t.co/NMDugPQypv
Ohio State has become the reincarnation of Pete Carroll's later USC teams that slipped out of national title picture early but always drilled someone in the Rose Bowl.
Short memory. Those Oregon &amp; Stanford teams earlier this decade were pretty darn good. https://t.co/A4frCoGxr7
This is every bit the mismatch I feared it would be. Someone had to win the Pac-12.

The overrated, ESPN-manufactured SEC is now 4-1 in its CFP/New Year's bowls, with the four wins all vs. Top 12 opponents. Only Georgia-Texas left.
Or not.
LSU has outgained UCF 556-250. 44:11-15:10 TOP. Somehow UCF still has a chance to take it to OT.
@tevisv They have 556 yards and 40 points.
Sooooo close, UCF.
Ten-win Kentucky!! What a year.
Believe it or not, the Big Ten West is now 8-1 in bowl games since last season.
If there was another set of committee rankings, Mississippi State might fall out of the top 18. https://t.co/yFiMfBsXHB
Wow, UCF needed that. Game on.
If you live in the Bay Area and want to see the national title game in person, tickets ($475 face value) are down to $221 on StubHub.

21-0 LSU since this tweet. https://t.co/mDbY66Ziif

He threw a punch? ... Oh. Yes. Yes he did.
Nothing else like it. https://t.co/np19aM5FSr
Wow, Joe Burrow. What a throw on that TD.
UCF’s defense came to play, but they’re not doing themselves any favors with these nonsense penalties.

I guess I’m a helpless traditionalist because I woke up more excited tor today than the semifinals. There’s something special about college football on New Year’s Day.
@DanWolken Don’t worry espn will make sure it doesn’t rain
Happy New Year to all of you! May your team be awesome in 2019.
@dcodell @JonSolomonAspen @BarrettSallee It’s sold out every year and gets better TV ratings than any non playoff bowl. Seems to be doing Ok.
@BarrettSallee Or because the SEC and Big 12 created their own immovable bowl the same year the playoff started.
It came together awkwardly, but Houston upgrading from Applewhite to Holgorsen is quite the coup. https://t.co/4vDElyvRHN

If bowl games are so meaningless, why do they always douse the winning coach with Gatorade?
Northwestern, which once went 64 years between bowl wins, is about to win its fourth in the last five. Given all the missing players and a 20-3 deficit, this Holiday Bowl W should be extra satisfying.

Stanford had a somewhat disappointing season, but still ended it with nine wins. Shaw has now won 9+ all but one season since taking over in 2011.
Late in the third quarter, Justin Herbert is 14-of-26 for 89 yards. Hurt by a couple big drops, but mostly MSU's defense has had his WRs on lockdown.
Halftime in Santa Clara: 0-0.  Hey Tua and Trevor Lawerence, can you get out here a week early?
I believe a medal should be awarded to any Michigan State fan who has watched this offense for 13 full games.

It's 38-27. Kyler Murray: 17-of-34 for 258 yards, two TDs, 0 INTs. 14 carries for 100 yards.
With that TD throw, Tua is 21-of-24 for 290 yards and three TDs.  In a national semifinal.
@MWM_7 Arkansas can't go 6-6 against ND's schedule.
Contrary to earlier reports, Kyler Murray has not forgotten how to play football. 49-yard TD pass. OU has cut it from 28-0 to 31-20.
Josh Jacobs is so damn good. And he's Alabama's third-leading rusher.
This reminds me of the Alabama-Michigan opener in 2012. Over in the first quarter. Nearly broke Denard Robinson in two on several occasions.
Mercy.
How on earth does that get called a backward pass? It's not even close.
Two drives in, seven different players already have touches for Alabama. All but one of Tua's six passes have gone for 10+ yards.
Three national championship games in four years for Clemson is an absolutely remarkable accomplishment. Tigers are now 55-4 since 2015.
Notre Dame went 12-0 vs. a perfectly respectable schedule. There is no conceivable selection process where they wouldn't be one of the four playoff teams. https://t.co/paKFdZrP0B

True freshman to true freshman on those two TDs. .. Clemson's not going anywhere.
Notre Dame's D has been outstanding. Lawrence doesn't look comfortable, Etienne hasn't had an impact yet.
I think that's right but lets all get furious with the officials anyway.
Wow, what a bizarre play. This could take 10 minutes for replay to unwind.
Notre Dame's getting good pressure on Lawrence. Blackledge notes they're blitzing more than they did during the season. Will be interesting to see how Tigers adjust.

@KrisBudden Nah, I was thinking Frisco.
@tygordon You want to cancel all the bowl games? Why?
So many questions.  1) Do the fans get a refund? 2) Do the schools still get their full payouts? 3) Does ESPN now owe the sponsor a buyback? 4) Bet some of the coaches had a bowl win bonus.
I guess the Cotton Bowl wasn't available tomorrow. (No? It's available 363 days a year?)
It's too bad there aren't any indoor stadiums in the DFW area they could move the game to.

@Coogcheese @dennisdoddcbs @PurdueMatt05 How do you plan to take opinion out of a sport with 130 teams? Who decides the at large spots? Who decides the seeds of the playoff?
Louisiana Tech's Jaylon Ferguson just broke Terrell Suggs' FBS career sacks leader (45). That's a heck of a feat. Stood for 16 years.
@bar2nitwit The 8-team playoff being discussed would not be the 8 "best" teams, it would be 8 teams -- six conference champs and 2 at-larges.
@TheeeeChad Yeah maybe.
Whoever thought to put the Hawaii Bowl in the Pac-12 After Dark time slot is my new hero.

Army embarrassing Houston so far. Gotta try to come back from 21-0 against a team that can hold it for 9 minutes at a time.

If you can’t tell, I’m very conflicted about the 8-team thing.  I cherish the fact it’s the rare sport that rewards season-long excellence.   But I also acknowledge that CFB’s larger postseason is broken and would benefit from more meaningful games.
Yes. College football has always been unique that way and has somehow remained very popular. https://t.co/Gn9nS0bbyl
It would crown the best team over those three weeks of a four month season. https://t.co/iDyerqrh3w

@NicoleAuerbach @TheAthleticCFB It also now sets the stage for a potential Big Ten vs. SEC showdown.  One is now open to 8 teams, the other (so far) is not.
@NicoleAuerbach @TheAthleticCFB Needless to say, the fact that Delany -- who for years fought against any playoff -- is now open to expansion is a major development.

I understand why Fields would transfer, but he could also stay at Georgia, play 4 games next year, then take over in 2020 (when Fromm presumably turns pro) and he’d still have three seasons of eligibility.

“This profession we’ve chosen is so fragile. A two-point conversion gets caught, this is a tough deal now.”  How Urban Meyer flipped the script of his exit in the span of 2 games. https://t.co/fExvNcAZiZ
Grad transfers can make snazzy commitment videos too.  (Kelly Bryant to Mizzou.) https://t.co/jjh4FaDw9q
Jarrett Stidham declares. https://t.co/KcirL64rIK
@EricTSRowe They count in the eyes of the NCAA.
As pointed out to me by a reader, three of the top five FBS active wins leaders -- Urban, Bill Snyder and Paul Johnson -- have retired within the span of a week.
They sure seem to on Twitter. https://t.co/zWf89Dflq0
As Meyer referenced today, how different would his announcement have felt if Maryland completes a 2-point conversion? "This profession we've chosen is so fragile." https://t.co/fExvNcAZiZ
If Urban Meyer is really done, he becomes the rare elite coach to go out on top. How dramatically he changed the narrative with one last championship surge.  My column on Meyer's highly successful, yet undeniably clouded legacy. https://t.co/fExvNcAZiZ
Willie Taggart's got a problem on his hands. https://t.co/K2mXGYBVGo
It sounds like Urban has no idea yet what he plans to do next. Says he and Gene Smith have "discussed" another role, that Columbus is home, etc.
It's a good thing for Ryan Day he won that TCU game. If he didn't (and go 3-0), I'm guessing Ohio State is conducting a national search right now.
Urban asked whether the suspension will have an impact on his legacy. "I'm sure it will. That was a disappointing time obviously ... The legacy, you can only control so much. I can lie to you and say that's not important to me. People have their opinions."
Urban: "The decision was the result of cumulative events," acknowledges this summer was one of them.
Urban: The style of coaching I’ve done for 33 years is intense, it’s very demanding. I’ve tried to delegate more, tried to be more CEOish, but the product started to fail. I had to get right back to it.   The challenge was, can I continue to do it in that style?"
Urban was asked directly, and he answers: "I believe I will not coach again."
Urban: "This would be a really tough day if (the program) were a mess. And personally, this day would be awful. To be able to know we felt we did right made this easier."
Urban says headaches hit "real hard" in Penn State game last year. Needed treatment. Had conversations starting then about coaching longevity.
Much like Bob Stoops' comments about Lincoln Riley, Urban says his decision was made easier knowing he had someone like Day to hand it off to.
Gene Smith says for the last month, every Sunday, he and Urban began talking about potential transition to Ryan Day. "Our program does not need disruption."
Ryan Day to Urban: "You can now sit in a box and yell at us for going for it or not going for it on fourth down."
Urban Meyer gave one brief statement. This appears to be more a Ryan Day introduction press conference.
Gene Smith just gave our @AriWasserman props for his scoop in September that the school was working to make Ryan Day the head coach in waiting.
Gene Smith indicates Urban is staying on a in a "new capacity" in the athletic department.
Urban Meyer/Ryan Day press conference starting now.
@Marc_Condon yes. Thanks for reminding me of a much smarter moment in my life.
FSU fans, if you're not following/reading Tashan by now, you might want to correct that. https://t.co/eOh2QiHnAB

@tylerturnermpls All due respect, your alma mater hired Baylor's AD who was involved in a heinous sexual assault scandal. I didn't make that ethics joke out of thin air.
@Lord_Saied There are no clicks on Twitter. I get literally nothing of monetary value out of a tweet.

It was only two years ago that McCaffrey and Fournette made "shocking" decisions to skip their bowl games.  Two years later, it feels like it's already swung to where first-rounders saying they'll play is a surprise.
@ChuckCarlisle Whats the advantage exactly? They have to go undefeated. Oklahoma does not.

This is cool to see. https://t.co/TF3zqFU2oE
He also voted Oklahoma No. 4, Georgia No. 5. https://t.co/FzEEmdvqcZ
Here was Rob Mullens' explanation of Georgia No. 5, Ohio State No. 6.  "The committee thinks highly of Georgia's body of work. We also think highly of Ohio State's body of work, but at times they have been inconsistent. We noted their only loss was to an unranked team."
LOL. The stadium, not the bowl itself. https://t.co/7wFP50yKcT

The ripple effect of that surprise Holiday Bowl Utah pick is that Stanford slips to the Sun Bowl. Second trip in 3 years.
Official. Holiday Bowl: Northwestern-Utah.
It's Oregon-Michigan State in the Redbox Bowl (Santa Clara) on New Year's Eve.

It will be UCF vs. LSU in the Jan. 1 Fiesta Bowl.
New Year's Six matchups now being announced:  Florida-Michigan in the Dec. 29 Peach Bowl.
Just now seeing the final Top 25. Committee did not heed Washington State's plea to be reconsidered for top 12.
Wow. https://t.co/w406EDz1BI

Mullens basically said the committee followed their instructions by the book.  I don't think you would say that about the Kirby Hocutt years.
Mullens: "Amongst the group of three, no one was unequivocally better than the others. So we leaned on the protocol." I.e., conference champion.
Mullens: There was at least one member that supported each of Oklahoma, Georgia and Ohio State as No. 4. "We didn't get a lot of sleep."
Rob Mullens on Oklahoma: "In the end, 1 loss conference champion with their only loss on a neutral field, close loss to a ranked team they avenged. And their defense has made some big plays the last couple weeks."
Good question. https://t.co/S4SFNHObup
Alabama, Clemson and Oklahoma have now accounted for 60 percent of the all-time playoff berths. (12/20).
Every year we learn a new lesson about the committee.  This year's: Don't get blown out. By anyone.
And Georgia was No. 5!  Ohio State No. 6.
OFFICIAL   No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 4 Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl  No. 2 Clemson vs. No. 3 Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl
No. 4 is ... Oklahoma!
Oh come on guys!
No. 3 Notre Dame.
No. 2 Clemson.
Here we go. For real this time.   No. 1: Alabama.
Color me shocked: Finebaum "has become convinced" Georgia should be in the playoff.
One thing that's become clear watching ESPN since last night: No one on the air there thinks Notre Dame is all that good.

The selection committee has always been adamant they pick the four "best," not "most deserving."  Why I think the committee will strongly consider Georgia &gt; Oklahoma. https://t.co/XVGXKReKch
It was like a lot of Ohio State's games: Haskins made a lot of big plays, D gave up a lot of big plays. End of day, Ohio State will be 12-1, back-to-back Big Ten champ, at worst going to the Rose Bowl.
That's just not the case.  They will likely have four Top 25 wins come tomorrow (adding Stanford). Nine of 12 opponents bowl-eligible. 75-55 record. https://t.co/XMXgc8f3sJ
It's a good thing for Notre Dame they expanded the thing to four. https://t.co/PhYMBqfYZX
You get a fumble, no YOU get a fumble.
https://t.co/zF3CoOVEph
I doubt the committee has the stones to leave out three Power 5 champs, but I do believe they will strongly consider Georgia.
Kirk Herbstreit just said he thinks the committee will move Georgia UP to No. 3.  "I don't get caught up in champions I get caught up in 'best.'"
Can't stop Dwayne Haskins when he's throwing 'em like that. Wow.
Uh, that's Northwestern's backup RB breaking off a 77-yard TD run.
Is it too late to get Christian Wilkins to New York?
Dwayne Haskins picking up where he left off last week. He could throw another 6 TDs tonight.
Clemson, Sharpie.
POLL: Who would you vote No. 4 tomorrow?
Clemson-Pitt and Ohio State-Northwestern won't seem anticlimactic at all after that.
We think. But I would imagine Georgia will get serious consideration. https://t.co/zJMsBMoV41
I've watched Saban win lord knows how many championships. That's the first time he's ever gotten emotional. About Hurts.
Just when I think Georgia can't find a more agonizing way to lose to Alabama, they do it again.
In all seriousness, this has been the most compelling game of the season, and maybe even the past several seasons. And I don't even know how it ends yet.
Go ahead and option the script now, Hollywood. https://t.co/Rj1KvURLi6
SEC Championship Game MVP Jalen Hurts.
Maybe Kirby wanted his Saban onside kick against Clemson moment.  That wasn't it.
Not like that, Georgia. Not like that.
It's like they took that epic 2012 SEC title game and said, yeah that was OK, take a look at this.
IT'S ALL HAPPENING
UCF won with their backup QB, what you got Bama?
@_Collin1 Yes
Welcome back, 2017 Alabama offense. I forgot you were pretty good too.
@codeis12345 He got stepped on by his own teammate.
Unreal. A year later, it's going to have to be Jalen to the rescue.
Meanwhile, UCF with its backup QB has rallied to go up 49-41 with 6:37 left.
Tua's hurt. Plain and simple. Can't move around like he usually does, can't get the ball out as fast.  Question is whether 100% Jalen Hurts would be more effective than &lt; 100% Tua.
Georgia-Alabama has become the new Clemson-Alabama. These games are something else.
And ... one-score game. Which is something given the extent to which Georgia has dominated this game.
I think Tua is so used to his receivers running wide open, he's holding on to the ball longer, not getting it out as fast as usual, leading to sacks and INTs.
Fromm is 15-of-19 for 162 yards and three TDs.'  Tua is 3-of-11 for 35 yards and a pick
Anybody in Georgia still want to bench Jake Fromm for Justin Fields? .. Good lord, what a game he's having.

Saban: "All in all, not a good half."
The Nick Saban halftime locker room for this one will be something.
@Reality555 I would hope so, it's a UCF home game.
Meanwhile, it's halftime and UCF is down 38-21 to Memphis.  Assuming that news has made its way to Boise.
Credit to Josh Jacobs for getting it back. That would have been disaster for Bama.
Such an enormous call here. Looks like a TD.
Oh it's on.  Georgia 21, Alabama 7.
Alabama hasn't been in a game like this all season and it shows. They look rattled.
UAB Football  Shut down in 2014 Restored in 2017 Conference Champions in 2018.  Incredible.
Of course it is, but it was also more impressive than anything OU had on its resume as of Tuesday. And they ranked them the way they did. https://t.co/ptEVd2Wmai
Yeah, yeah, the fix was in. https://t.co/LDFN2Yr3ur
There was some thought going in that Ohio State could jump OU if OU didn't look good ... but sorry, that was the Sooners' most impressive win of the season.
That's going to do it.   Four straight Big 12 titles for Oklahoma. And you would think only Georgia upsetting Alabama can keep them out of the playoff at this point.
After that KR got wiped out, Texas was briefly listed as having 13 penalties for 195 yards.  It's 13 penalties for 128, which is still ... not good.
Credit to Murray and the offense for stretching out that drive. But for a defense that's taken so much flack, OU forced a punt &amp; got a safety on Texas' two 4Q possessions.
What. A. Catch.
Texas had had the ball for less than 3 minutes of the fourth quarter.
Hate seeing Marquise Brown on crutches on the sideline.
Sounds like Louisville's going to make a run at him. https://t.co/o7zrjK7mfh
Appalachian State will play in the New Orleans Bowl, Louisiana-Lafayette in the Cure Bowl.

Here's a great view of the non-PI call. (It's a close call.) https://t.co/FIhti4ogQL
The loudest this stadium has been all night was them booing during Larry Scott's trophy presentation. Not kidding.
The Utah fans are booing, wanted PI on that 4th down.  Game over.
Byron Murphy again!   Turnover on downs.   Washington is going to be your Pac-12 champ.
Utah was on the move until trying that screen pass in the middle of the field with less than 50 seconds left and 1 timeout. Yeesh.
I was at last year's Foster Farms Bowl. Accurate comparison. https://t.co/WsWvq9CLwf
The announced attendance at Pac-12 title game is 35,134.
Byron Murphy man. Second interception. That one may ice it.
Washington's 38-yard FG attempt is blocked. Utah, still within a TD, takes over at its own 21 with 5:10 left.
Midway through the fourth quarter, Utah has run 38 plays for 133 yards.
Shelley with the overthrow, Jordan Miller with the pick. Washington's star-studded secondary taking over the second half.
A game-swinging Washington 66-yard pick six in which the ball rolled off the back of the Utah receiver's leg and into Byron Murphy's hands. Wow.  10-3 UW, late 3Q.
Utah 53-yard FG. ... Utah always has the special teams.
Utah comes out on the attack to start the second half. Back-to-back long passes for Jason Shelley, though this one might come back.
HALFTIME: Washington 3, Utah 0.  Hope you're enjoying the heck out of this, people who hated on that OU-WVU game.
These defenses are no joke. Utah is getting after Browning &amp; not giving up big plays. Meanwhile, Utah offense only has one first down.
Yet another tip drill, this time it gets intercepted by Utah. That one was just bad luck.
Chantel to the rescue. https://t.co/MHdUQdqj6W
@jhallito I wish I could, it's underneath me.
Now THAT was a near disaster for Jake Browning. Careful guy.
A 13-play Washington drive bogs down at the Utah 23. Browning fortunate not to get picked on 3rd down, incomplete on 4th.
Six minutes until kickoff. A Rose Bowl berth on the line. https://t.co/kE4Ps6itcm

Ken Wisenhunt?? Seriously?  I give up. https://t.co/r87SFJjjRn
Some interesting coaching news. https://t.co/zV8Tg799j6
As they should be. https://t.co/RkDLQh1zJ9
Wait ... how is Ferrell the Defensive Player of the Year, but Wilkins finished way ahead of him for Player of the Year?  Make up your mind, ACC! https://t.co/Xn4cYtiRn7
Interesting that Christian Wilkins gets more national acclaim (Bednarik, Outland finalist), but the people who watch Clemson more closely honored Ferrell. https://t.co/CVvbyBbC2t
@A2BuckNutz Also affects who goes to the other major bowls.
LOL https://t.co/XdF7X42LBg
Not only did 9-3 Kentucky win at 9-3 Florida, but now that the committee has Florida higher than LSU, Kentucky also has the better win of the two.  Still, Florida No. 9, LSU No 10 ... Kentucky No. 15.
Why the heck does the committee think Florida is so much better than Kentucky?   Is it punishing UCF for Milton's injury?   My thoughts on Mack Brown to UNC.  More Mailbag: https://t.co/smg1CUTJjY
Brent Musburger with an amazing line when the UCLA loss goes final and K State can now play its way into the BCS title game. “Unplug the computers!”

Everything you need to know from tonight’s CFP rankings.  https://t.co/q48Bz9eEA7
Got a Mailbag question about tonight's rankings? Stewart@TheAthletic.com.
Rob Mullens says Oklahoma has "a little bit stronger schedule right now than Ohio State."  Obviously that's not going to change this weekend.
Yes. https://t.co/iJR3KbkcF8
Rob Mullens mentions Oklahoma's "historic offense." Was wondering when that might come up.
And I think it goes without saying that Alabama is in win or lose. Dominated a conference that the committee believes is so strong it holds 4 Top 10 and 8 Top 25 teams.
... Am I the only one who thinks this is possibly setting it up for 2-loss Georgia to make it?   None of the other contenders have more than 2 Top 25 Ws. https://t.co/bZB0F8fASt
Alabama and Georgia both picked up a new Top 25 win with Missouri's appearance.   Alabama now 4-0, Georgia 3-1.
Wow. https://t.co/UuEFKtb60B
No. 5 Oklahoma, No. 6 Ohio State.  There you have it.
Unless they randomly move teams down next week, there will officially be four SEC teams in the New Year's Six.
No. 7 Michigan No. 8 UCF No. 9 Florida No. 10 LSU
Do even Florida fans believe Florida is the ninth-best team in the country?
Washington State: 13th. Below 3-loss Penn State. Ouch.
I don't think they're going to be debating ND-Michigan tonight.
Another bowl bid is official: Arkansas State is going to the Arizona Bowl.  Also, winner of App St-ULL Sun Belt title game will go to New Orleans Bowl, loser to Cure Bowl.
Outside of the playoff contenders, biggest question tonight is whether Wazzu stays high enough to make a NY6 bowl.   My Bowl Projections as of now. https://t.co/SX8RIEZvuD
Laughable in general, but, this year the coach missed 1/4 of the season. https://t.co/SPTPVY5Net

Just looked at new AP and coaches polls for first time. Both sent Wazzu plummeting to No. 13, behind four 3-loss teams.  If committee follows suit, no NY6 bowl.

FWIW, the USC fan next to me on my flight home is fine with keeping Helton. Expected it to be a rebuilding year, thinks the program could use stability.  They do exist.
I don’t think anything Swann said is wrong. Helton did have “one bad season.” ND/Kelly did come back from theirs.  But USC fans have made up their mind. They’re done with him. There’s no winning then back. That stadium will be empty Week 1 next year.
They couldn’t even show him on the scoreboard last night without the stadium booing. This is really something. https://t.co/QYJBjVlP11

@bobrum1977 @GrantTraylor @espn What about Michigan's?
@KrisBudden We were definitely worried for you.
Would not have guessed 59-56 would get eclipsed a night later by 74-72.
I’m at Brian Kelly’s postgame press conference, am I missing anything on TV?
This is quite a low-key playoff clinching celebration for the Irish. At least in public view. Some smiles and some guys yelling “That’s 12!”
Yep. https://t.co/JzAvHgGPxy
I had just gotten down the the Notre Dame sideline when Tony Jones ran right past me. They’re getting a little excited down here.
USC commits so many penalties that wipe out big plays it's just maddening.
Jeez, it was 38-21 K-State! https://t.co/RhLpDy6x1o
Dexter Williams. Gone. ND had been struggling to run all night, but with that 52-yard TD run it's now ahead 14-10.
Thanks to some surprises like Wake and Minnesota, we are now up to 80 bowl-eligible teams for 78 spots. K-State is well on its way to making it 81. TCU, Va Tech can get there as well.
HALFTIME: USC 10, ND 7.  J.T. Daniels is 26-of-31 for 244 yards. That ought to net you more than 10 points.
Apparently that's not allowed. https://t.co/Ru1nYhxIvb
Huge forced fumble by Notre Dame's Alohi Gilman in their red zone. Irish could be down so much more if not for those two SC fumbles.
There's the Ian Book you're used to seeing. Great throw and catch to Chris Finke to cut to 10-7.
We've got a little something brewing here at the Coliseum. 10-0 SC and ND just got stopped on 4th down.
End of a first quarter in which USC looked like the 11-0 team and ND looked like the 5-6 team.   But it's only 7-0.
It's like this previously orderly season saved all the crazy for this weekend.
Brutal turnover for USC. Trojans had been doing exactly what they wanted offensively again, but Pittman fumbles after the catch, ND recovers.
Clay Helton just came on the JumboTron for a PSA during a timeout thanking their fans. The fans booed.
The Piesman locked up before the Heisman. https://t.co/a8hNZyLxvD
Really strong opening drive for USC to go up 7-0 on Notre Dame. JT Daniels sharp on those quick passes, and Trojans finish it off with a 14-yard run.

@realpowersbrian Yes. Soon as I stepped out of the garage
Just got to the LA Coliseum and the first thing I saw was an airplane banner: “Lynn Swann Please Fire Clay Helton”
It will be nice to have an actual controversy to debate Tuesday night.  (OSU vs OU)  Also, ESPN, I think we solved the “is Michigan better than ND” one.
That’s going to be the big question this week. One thing Oklahoma’s got that Ohio State doesn’t is a decent non-conference win. https://t.co/cOL93AR9j4
Yup. https://t.co/UPkzwAsq3X
Michigan’s No. 1 defense may end up giving up more points than Oklahoma or West Virginia last night.
Unreal. https://t.co/ACDDdD00a2
Not good for Kliff. https://t.co/WbMDJxRY0m
I’ve criticized Ohio State a lot this year. Kudos to the Buckeyes for one hell of a statement. Enjoy the heck out of it.
@QuadCityAmo And they both have extremely explosive offenses too
Funny this comes the morning after all the griping about OU-WVU defenses.  Michigan is Exhibit A that a great defense can only get you so far in 2018. You better have a QB and an offense that can produce big plays of its own.   That’s why Nick Saban adapted. Not sure Harbaugh has
Buckeyes freshman Chris Olave, who had barely played prior to 2 weeks ago, has 2 TD catches and a blocked punt that set up a TD in the Ohio State-Michigan game. Incredible.
It's a Scarlet and Gray day.   Again.
I'm all for putting in Martell as a spark when the offense is struggling. Pulling Haskins when he's having the game of his life is overthinking it.
It has felt at times like Michigan's offensive staff did not watch any Ohio State tape. https://t.co/ISy5m7MICF
Chase Winovich is playing but probably not close to full strength. Now Rashan Gary and Devin Bush are hurt. https://t.co/j7xqAs9E8a
This did not help Washington State. https://t.co/hZaU5iJWTa
Dwayne Haskins: 13-of-21 for 222 yards, three TDs, 0 INTs. Completions to nine different receivers.
HALFTIME: Ohio State 24, Michigan 19. Don Brown is usually the kind of second-half adjustments, let's see what he's got.
Dwayne Haskins is having his way with the nation's No. 1 defense. Wolverines look completely lost.
You really need to be chasing points before it's even halftime?
What an insane momentum swing.
OH NO
Wow, what a catch. Michigan definitely needed that.
OH... MY
Urban Meyer yards per attempt: -15.
Ohio State has found a freshman receiver and a hole in the nation's No. 1 passing defense.
@Peccman Thats not what I said.
Unlike previous Ohio St. opponents, Michigan doesn't have a Rondale Moore or Anthony McFarland likely to bust a 75-yard TD. Methodical, physical. Ohio State D needs to win the red zone.

HAHAHAAAA I made my pick 54-51 just for fun and it's going to end up way too low.
Let me rephrase it for you:  The QBs are great. The defenses are horrible. The game is fantastic. https://t.co/LBHRad5sZ8
Now that's a lot of missed tackles.
You don't think that has anything to do with the QBs they're facing? https://t.co/Ya7KlK1nX4

Well, they showed the Milton injury right off the bat of Virginia-VT halftime show. No warning.
McKenzie Milton has done it all the last 2 years. The face of UCF's rise. Hate, hate, hate to see this.
A devastating turn of events for UCF. Star QB McKenzie Milton being carted off the field. I didn't see the play live, but you know it's bad when they won't show the replay.
My goodness, Tre Turner. The Virginia Tech freshman makes a fantastic TD catch, then blocks a punt for a TD. 14-0 Hokies.

America wants to see a joint Nick Saban-Mike Leach pre-bowl press conference. https://t.co/57AxZ54tFm
So there's four spots separating Oklahoma and Ohio State.  Why?
Washington State did not budge from No. 8.
Rece is right. That 10-0 UCF is now above 10-1 Ohio State shows considerable respect for that program &amp; that conference.
UCF has moved above Ohio State.
Florida at No. 11 remains above the other three-loss teams (and thus in line for New Year's Six).  West Virginia at 8-2 down to No. 13.
Mississippi State back into the top 20. Of course.
Top 4's not going to change obviously. Most noteworthy possible wrinkle tonight would be Wazzu moving above Oklahoma.  Let's see.

@andrew_g_utes No that one’s a toss up.
@klzdad3 @austio311 Pretty much. Sometimes espn swaps some of the lower level G5 teams.
Holiday wants Oregon, and Utah was just in SF. So if Alamo takes UW, Utah falls to No. 5. https://t.co/Y6GzCL97uh
@JFurKSL Unfortunately that’s reality. Maybe if Washington loses the Apple Cup badly the Alamo would take the Utes instead. Oregon not falling past Holiday.

From yesterday, my thoughts on Les Miles to Kansas. (And this was before the press conference where he defiantly defended his LSU offense). https://t.co/wbaCCirOUF
@JSB_TV Congrats!
@TheChad_KC Also gave them an F for Charlie Weis. 1 for 2.
Said he did some self-assessment but "we didn't think there was anything negative."
I watched this answer. Miles still doesn't think there's any major philosophical changes to be made. https://t.co/7tnf5fibcr
Michigan opens as a 3.5-point favorite at Ohio State. I think a lot of people were expecting higher.
Les Miles introductory press conference at Kansas about to begin. You can watch it here: https://t.co/JsdanrfKy3
@JasonCleghorn I always tweet out my articles 2-3 times, I don't assume everyone's on Twitter at all times.  And a lot of people seem to appreciate the journalism we're doing at The Athletic. Doesn't mean you have to agree with all the takes.
@sammyk34 I just wanted someone outside the box. My recommendation was a triple option coach.
From earlier, my thoughts on Kansas hiring Les Miles. I'm ... not as optimistic as some. https://t.co/wbaCCirOUF
@Brad_Hope Everyone thought the Turner Gill hire was a good one. Sometimes it doesn't work out.
That would be @max_olson. https://t.co/VS9SsKo0iF https://t.co/HHU3DKN7kP
Nah there’s a coffee analogy involved. https://t.co/nSBfYpcoc9
@jeffhoss15 Yes
@dbbogeytag They did that with defenses full of five stars! That’s not gonna happen here.
New AP poll. At long last, Army. https://t.co/5YW4mUY3OB
There it is. (Read the whole thread.) https://t.co/WX1sUsIO0s

Roll out the red carpet for Matt Wells. https://t.co/ylmwGi7aQt
Pretty crazy to go from national coach of the year (deservedly so) to fired in 2 years. https://t.co/Rtx03n9GDE
I have said it before, I would have hired a triple option coach like Monken, Fritz, Lunsford. https://t.co/2RPmESgDeP
@DanRubenstein What makes you think he’ll be able to do that?
Note: I hope you appreciate the elaborate coffee-chain metaphor I came up with for this one.
Kansas badly needed to hire an innovative, imaginative coach to rescue the program. Instead, it chose Les Miles. My column on the faulty logic in its decision. https://t.co/wbaCCirOUF
Which I don’t understand either. It’s completely harmless. No one is taking away Alabama’s trophy. https://t.co/PYFphfMLuR
@njjayhawk My concern is he’s going to take you in the other direction.
The UCF backlash (see the comments in my Top 10) reminds me of when Boise State got high in the polls in 2010/‘11. Most sports fans embrace Cinderella. CFB fans dismiss or even despise them.

Oregon holds on. Congrats to Utah on clinching its first Pac-12 South title. Will meet Apple Cup winner in Santa Clara.
Oregon you really going to blow this?
Mike Leach doesn't run out the clock and he doesn't take out his Heisman-candidate QB up 62-28.  So now it's 69-28 on Minshew's 7th TD pass.
Per @starrettjason, Washington State's 55 first-half points vs. Arizona are the most by a Mike Leach-coached team in any half.
Gardner Minshew: 28-of-33 for 311 yards and five touchdowns. In the first half. Mustaches for everyone.
Washington State is putting on a show. Incredible.
And it's 48-14 and it's not even halftime. https://t.co/dqSLCSafcH
And just like that it's 41-14 Washington State midway through the second quarter. That escalated in a hurry.
Khalil Tate is finally healthy and #Pac12AfterDark is much better for it.
Sir, you didn't even beat Kansas by 21 tonight. https://t.co/5AtmxP030Y
Kirk is right. Put aside five teams, Bama, Clemson, ND, Michigan &amp; Georgia. .. After that, there's no one you would say, "Oh, they're definitely better than UCF."
Other than the one team (Texas) that already did? https://t.co/yAz5dRW6ul
Good question. (Relatively speaking, they're both still pretty good.) https://t.co/z9Fd01a4YZ
Big game in Morgantown on Friday. https://t.co/bBkQRyCGAN
Oklahoma is going to win the game but not before giving up 40 points and 524 yards to Kansas.
Kansas RB Pooka Williams now has 13 carries for 228 yards and two TDs. It's now 48-30 Oklahoma.
End of 3Q: Texas 24, Iowa State 3. Actually extended the lead even with Ehlinger out.
He really is. https://t.co/9WujldEGmb
Kansas is running the ball down Oklahoma's throat. I'm not kidding.  Sooners up 21-17.
Texas offense looking sharp early, up 14-3 on Iowa State after a 94-yard drive.
I stand corrected, even the app knows whether or not you get the cable channel. https://t.co/a1aGLBD07z
@iamabugeater @espn You can watch it legally on Watch ESPN
@MexHeadroom Yes
@PeterBurnsESPN OK, but let's deal with bye/idle first.
This just makes Texas-Iowa State tonight that much bigger.   Hope you have a premium sports tier.
Texas now controls its destiny. https://t.co/CYlGJwzbqh
Down go the Mountaineers. Big 12 playoff hopes are down to just the Sooners.
WVU will have one last play with 1 second left from the Oklahoma State 14.
Will Grier, man. That throw.
Touchdown Pokes to take the lead on WVU with 42 seconds left.
Look at Oklahoma State.
FSU going to knock off BC, could still save its bowl streak if it can beat Florida next week.

Chip Kelly the happiest 3-8 coach in America.  Clay Helton ... 5-6 about to face 11-0 Notre Dame, so ...
UCLA finishes off USC. Unreal.
Watching this game you would never guess UCLA is 2-8, and you would never guess USC has won five games.
All that stands between Notre Dame and a playoff spot is next week's game at USC. Last won there in 2012.
@harrimsa You think he enlisted a doctor to make something up? (And risk losing his license)

He has a cyst in his brain that causes stress-induced headaches. I’d imagine games like today are more stressful than 14-point wins. https://t.co/gPSECg2RKX
After all that ... Ohio State is 10-1 and can win the Big Ten East next week.
These are usually the craziest. https://t.co/89HmFEL9nr
For Urban's sake, I really hope they go for 2 if they get the TD. I can't watch the cutaways if it goes to OT.
@v_bled22 He explained his condition a few weeks ago. It's very real and very painful.
This is still plenty of time (1:41) for Ohio State to go down and score a TD. Maryland may only be able to stop them with a turnover.
That's how you know it's your day.
That Maryland TD getting called out at the 1 is turning out to be the worst thing that could have happened to Ohio State. Clock is now under 2 minutes.
This is getting harder and harder to watch. https://t.co/hQR6OQ7flL
@BeerOnTheMoon Please delete
@jdubs88 Uh oh.
Matt Canada looks like a genius for that fake punt. Maryland cashes in with an incredible TD throw to go up 38-31 w/ 7:50 left.
Umm that's a touchdown.
Ohio State has come back to tie it at 31-31.   Maryland's offense has been big play or bust all season and so far it has 0 in the second half.
It looks more like a Dec. 20 bowl game.
I can't believe this late-season game with enormous playoff implications is being played at a baseball stadium.
I believe this is what Herbstreit meant by “anguished.” https://t.co/0Fam34c96F
Mic drop. https://t.co/s3eqlzRfeS
So much for the Landmark Media Case of the Century. (That proved completely baseless.) https://t.co/rUxFhfeDYL
Oops. Dwayne Haskins throws a pick-six to start the second half.
@jdubs88 7
That ship has sailed. https://t.co/Pm6Atl6FIP
Given everything that went wrong for Ohio State in the first half (including that fumble just now), 24-17 deficit is not bad. I'd let Haskins have at it in the 2nd half.
The Citadel had a FG attempt to take the first second-half lead on Alabama all season but missed badly.
Maryland having its own meltdown now.
@KyleCox2002 If Kansas went 23-23 they'd throw the guy a parade.
Thank you. https://t.co/4vcf6f9w5K
Maryland isn't running the option, but it has run 20 times and attempted 3 passes.
Do you see that Alabama-Citadel score, Jeff Long? Has Les Miles signed the contract already? You can still take my suggestion. https://t.co/bcQ9264H9T
You know Saban absolutely loves this. https://t.co/xFMjLTpcSP
Maryland's Anthony McFarland now has 7 carries for 214 yards two minutes into the second quarter.
There goes Anthony McFarland again!
Well played! https://t.co/m9NdtF8rLf
In 2011 when Alabama won the national title, the most points it allowed all season (21) was to triple-option foe Georgia Southern.
First The Citadel tied it at 7-7, and now it just recovered an Alabama fumble.
Wow.
"False start, everyone but the center."
Same thing it's been doing all season. https://t.co/N72ilpND6f
Maryland's Anthony McFarland with 81 and 75 yard TDs in the first six minutes against Ohio State.
... Oh really, Terps?
@OldTakesExposed I also gave them an F for Charlie Weis.
@realpowersbrian Imagine how much they would save on search firms
I don't get caught up in who's the biggest name and who's the biggest splash.  Les Miles is not the right choice for Kansas. https://t.co/mc12Ctp78V
Tammy and her 3-year old granddaughter. Just awful. https://t.co/QL9GrQhepm
I think unfortunately ADs, donors etc at struggling programs get caught up in “who will make the biggest splash?” That splash lasts 8 months and doesn’t win you a single game.   The much more important question is, who has the smartest long-term plan for our program?
Herm to his credit turned out to have a very extensive and innovative vision for his program. I’ll be curious to see what Les has in mind. https://t.co/QNM6yNQoPv
@notthefakeSVP You’re not getting 2007 Les. What in his last five years as a head coach gave any indication he can be innovative enough to win at a place where you’re never going to beat people with talent alone?

Same Top 10 as last week. First time that's ever happened.   UCF at No. 11 is the highest ranking a G5 team has reached.
No. 21 Mississippi State's 4 losses:  28-7 to Kentucky 13-6 to Florida 19-3 to LSU 24-0 to Alabama
Florida now the highest-ranked three-loss team at No. 13, followed by Penn State and Texas.
Wow, Pac-12. Washington up to No. 18, Utah back at No. 19.
Utah State, Cincinnati and Boise State all now ranked.
Sure enough. Mississippi State No. 21.
“Did anything change from last week?”  “Nope.”  “And we’re all agreed that UCF can’t be alllowed to sniff the Top 10?”  “And that Mississippi State must stay ranked no matter how many games it loses.”  “Great. What’s for lunch?”

Last 3 games against Florida, Kentucky and Auburn, D'Andre Swift is averaging a mere 9.9 yards per carry.

No. 16 Mississippi State losing 21-0 at the half at Alabama. Keep it to 28-0 and the committee may move them up.
No. 11 Kentucky losing 17-0 at the half at 4-5 Tennessee. Definitely in danger of falling out of the committee's Top 12.
Poor Bulldogs. Two TDs wiped off the board, 3rd down sack, missed field goal. And ... halftime.
David Cutcliffe, National Treasure https://t.co/V4R0XW81ax
By any metric, Mississippi State has one of the best defenses in the country. So far all that’s meant is it takes Alabama a few more plays to score.
Michigan State's first five second-half drives started at their own 5, their own 6, their own 3, their own 1 and their own 2. All on downed punts.
I don't think that one was on purpose.
Drue Chrisman Walter Camp Player of the Week nominee.
Bold move, Cotton. https://t.co/99AQRNUa6S
It's 7-6. Points are at a premium. And you're going to give the other team two points just b/c you're afraid of getting punt blocked?
I'm not sure I've ever seen a team that's LOSING by a point take an intentional safety.
Rocky Lombardi era.
Ohio State might want to think about using Martell like that more often. Some of their rushing issues may be due to defenses not having to account for Haskins as a runner.
@dirkchatelain But it still counts as a sellout?
Ohio State-Michigan State is fantastically ugly.
The shame of Wisconsin’s disappointing season is it’s made everyone forget how awesome Jonathan Taylor is.
@v_bled22 @TreyMcBride They were 9-4 and 8-5 his two seasons. They’re headed toward 2-10 and they’re not competitive. That’s a pretty step plummet.

If you’re interested in CFP show, the hoops game on ESPN is down to the last minute. Show will come on after.
We’re a few minutes away from the new CFP rankings. Gear up with some Bowl Projections.  https://t.co/bpZH1w91DM
Wow. Former Miami president Donna Shalala has been elected to Congress. Known for her skills as a fundraiser of course. https://t.co/caD0XmoWpB
Why we the networks reporting on who’s winning a race with 25 percent  of the votes in? That’s like trying to predict the national champ after three games.  Oh right, we do that.
Things are not going well in Miami right now. https://t.co/Or1jNUbIR8
Imagine if it had been competitive. https://t.co/QbhywFjx6U
Try picturing that today: The coach of Kansas having a change of heart about going to Georgia. https://t.co/qbzyGyTkYs
@ChrisRaab3 @TheAthleticCFB @NicoleAuerbach Nope.
New Bowl Projections, in which Maryland-Miami hold an ACC reunion, Texas A&amp;M-Texas Tech do the Big 12 version and Ga. Tech-Tulane the circa 1960 SEC version. https://t.co/bpZH1w91DM
@tashanreed You are not old enough to feel old.
It's already become one of the most popular stories in the history of @TheAthleticCFB: The viral LSU fan glaring at the camera tells her story to @NicoleAuerbach. https://t.co/HL6CE4iSlB
@orangelionmarc Possibly. Though first bowl in five years. BC was there last year.
Every Tuesday from here: My full Bowl Projections for all 40 games.  https://t.co/bpZH1w91DM
@Brett_A_Wilson @SarahASmith_ She was indeed.
Our @NicoleAuerbach tracked down LSU's breakout star from Saturday, @kaileighthomas_ (and another CFB meme legend with some advice for her). https://t.co/HL6CE4iSlB
Ok this is awesome. https://t.co/OaMHN4vTWB
@ketrickb You probably need to log in on your browser. Once you do that it will open in the app.
@CougSutra @CFBPlayoff it'd be whoever finishes higher in the rankings.

Forward Pass: The Big 12 took a risk when it brought back the title game. Two OU-WVU games in 8 days would certainly test it. https://t.co/Hjgh2A2qdl

@ADriggers81 Yep
New Top 10, where I found myself running out of teams that feel worthy of the Top 10. https://t.co/aW04c5yanw
Last night in Baton Rouge was one hell of an atmosphere. Until it became apparent LSU, like 8 teams before it, had no shot against Alabama. Column: https://t.co/eEG1PdOwGJ
Column from Baton Rouge, where Alabama showed it can still maul a top 5 team in the trenches. And it has Tua. https://t.co/eEG1PdOwGJ
What a hot mess. https://t.co/EzMxend0R3
Fist thing Saban said in his press conference was they wanted to “make a statement” because people were questioning their schedule. https://t.co/V3Aa3rikm8
“We want Bama!” chant from ... Bama fans. https://t.co/rJfAa4taF7
10 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 3.5 TFLs so far tonight. https://t.co/i6NbXmNWGI
Gotta try to end a drive on "not punt" at some point. https://t.co/Xs2WBvxfgD
Can someone check and see what chart Coach O is using to make these punting decisions?
Coming into today at least, no other team in the country had missed six extra points. We'll continue to monitor this developing Alabama crisis.
But can you *really* be the Greatest Team of All-Time if you can't make an extra point?
Not fair.
As amazing as Tua is, as flashy as  Alabama's offense is now ... this still looks awfully familiar.   LSU halftime vs. Alabama:  2016: 0 points. 2017: 3 points. 2018: 0 points.
Wait, Alabama's going to get it back before halftime? Uh oh.
Seriously. https://t.co/YOyBbdMmWP
I've got nothing left to say at this point. Tua is ridiculous. That TD throw was perfection.
Can he pass protect? https://t.co/lFK5tFgbmp
And there it is: Tua's first interception. It was bound to happen at some point. He keeps launching it down field when pressured. (And man, the velocity on that pick was breathtaking).
LSU has been unable to get anything going on offense. Burrow is 7-of-15 for 63 yards, and LSU has run just 8 times for -2 yards.
Tiger Stadium tonight is as loud as I've ever heard a stadium. Especially when LSU defense has a 3rd down.
Alabama has now missed FIVE extra points this season.
Wow, targeting overturned.  Did Carville make a call??
Wow, LSU already down Devin White, now about to lose Grant Delpit to targeting?
Alabama can't convert a 3rd and 23 with its third-string QB ... and they want to win the national title?? Cmon.
LOUD https://t.co/jO71HQ1QSO
It’s still a half hour until kickoff and this place is rocking. Incredible atmosphere. https://t.co/9wlu6earxP
Wow, West Virginia, wow.
@amitkmallik I see!
So this is pretty crazy, but Northwestern could finish 0-3 out of conference if it loses to ND tonight. But that Iowa loss means they're effectively 2 games up in the Big Ten West with 3 to play.
Purdue beats Iowa on a last-second field goal, essentially knocks Iowa out of Big Ten West contention.
Illinois 45, Minnesota 17. Discuss.
Michigan &amp; Penn State just switching off by year now which one destroys the other.
It’s empty now, but ... https://t.co/keJyfBhGmc
They know how to do it at LSU. https://t.co/tJioHVS75h
@Matt_Fortuna @MattatTheState Wow!
Clemson has scored 77 points while running 49 plays. They’re averaging 14 yards per carry.
I’m still really excited for the game tonight but all I really wanted from my trip to Louisiana was this. https://t.co/esXJcDjOXS
They may well still win by three TDs but Ohio State just looks broken. https://t.co/CaW0Er0cPe
Nebraska’s hanging in there. Turned a sack strip of Dwayne Haskins into a 64 yard TD drive to cut to 16-14.
Backward. Impressive. https://t.co/RcriBTJFpj
So how many points does Clemson want to score today?

Might not have been the best week for UCF’s AD to break out the “if we go undefeated again” line.

This seems like a relevant moment to note that @ChrisVannini's invaluable Coaching Tracker is back (linked). https://t.co/kDba4uGETP
The Maryland board of regents met five times to arrive at their decision. The public overturned it in 24 hours.
Un-believable. https://t.co/ENr1EeTUkX

Some excellent reporting here from ⁦@NicoleAuerbach⁩ on the reactions to DJ Durkin’s return in and around the program https://t.co/BH0Y9eCfRn
Maryland’s press conference today was astonishing and embarrassing, and it has me asking yet again: Why is this school in the Big Ten?  https://t.co/3pk8NMnBUO
@tvmbama31 Out of the top 25? There are 5-3 teams in there.
Got CFP rankings questions you want me to answer in tomorrow's Mailbag? Email stewart@theathletic.com.
On teleconference, committee chair Rob Mullens notes that LSU has the most wins over +.500 teams (six), and that UCF is the only team in the Top 25 that doesn't have any.
It's officially "wins against teams above .500" season.
Full committee Top 25. https://t.co/qef2hfBjCe
It will be No. 1 vs. No. 3 Saturday night in Death Valley. LSU comes in one spot ahead of Notre Dame.
Washington State No. 8! Who said the Pac-12's dead?
Cue #UCFTwitter
UCF No. 12 in the first CFP rankings.
How about Syracuse No. 19 in the first CFP rankings.
Cable markets. Cable markets. Cable markets. https://t.co/fNaMQfE8Zu
@Tatumspop the latter
A reporter asks them to confirm that Durkin will be back on the sideline Saturday. The board chair defers to the president. The president gets up and says, basically, that's the athletic director's decision. Again avoids saying Durkin's name.
It is so awkward up there. He clearly wants nothing to do with any of this. https://t.co/YVmZZpKxnM
Wallace Loh and the board chair will not be getting together for coffee anytime soon.
As the Washington Post reported, Wallace Loh announces he will retire from the presidency in June.
Off to a great start already. https://t.co/XgJC7nXqOP
Wallace Loh REALLY likes his ship metaphors.
Is this real life?
Maryland president Wallace Loh on AD Damon Evans: "He is in my judgement one of the finest athletic directors in the country."  He really said that.
Maryland board chair on Durkin: "We believe he is a good man and a good coach."
Maryland board chair: "We believe that Coach Durkin has been unfairly blamed for the dysfunction in the athletic department. He bares some of the responsibility, but not all of it."
I'm not sure I've ever heard the word "dysfunction" so much in a press conference, much less one to announce they're bringing everyone back.
The Maryland board chair just had an amusing slip and briefly referred to the coach as Dr. Durkin.
DJ Durkin coming back + Urban Meyer discuses his health + first CFP rankings in a few hours.  One of those news days.
And now he's reportedly going to retire in June. As in, get me out of this loony bin. https://t.co/JYLnQe4jqY
You would think DJ Durkin is Vince Lombardi the lengths Maryland has gone to in justifying bringing him back.
INCREDIBLE https://t.co/kvdSAoqG7J

Through 8 games, the highest-ranked defense Alabama has faced in YPP is 90th (Missouri). Five are No. 100 or lower.  LSU on Saturday is 24th.
He's awesome.   Last night against undefeated USF: 28-of-40 for 419 yards, five TDs; 12 rushes for 132 yards and 2 TDs. https://t.co/9qfSB6f5Ni

What a game. Stanford 25 yard TD ties it at 38-38 with 1:25 left. With first place on the like. Get to PAC-12 Network if you have it.
Gardner Minshew has been unstoppable in the second half. His TD puts Wazzu up 38-31 with 4:28 left. Now 37-of-45 for 387 yards and three TDs on the night.
It is indeed. https://t.co/nmzUtZgV9t
You can tell Bryce Love is in rough shape when Stanford brings in a different RB on 3rd and 1.
Gardner Minshew in the second half is 16-of-16 for 147 yards and a TD.
Gardner Minshew TD strike, and it's 31-31 with 12:26 left.
Cal knocks off Washington 12-10.  Stanford-Wazzu is now for sole possession of first in the Pac-12 North. Cardinal up 31-24 early in the fourth but Cougs in the red zone.
Halftime: Stanford 28, Washington State 17.  KJ Costello on fire: 19-of-22 for 192 yards and three TDs.
Stanford has now targeted Arcega-Whiteside in the end zone three times. He's caught a TD and drawn two PIs. (The last one debatable.)
KJ Costello with a heck of a play for Stanford's TD to go up 21-14. Washington State no answer so far for big Cardinal TE Kaden Smith (5 catches, 80 yards, 1 TD)

Nice opening TD drive for Wazzu.  Minshew with some great throws and James Williams with a 16-yard run, 33-yard catch and a TD run.
It truly is Kentucky's year!!  UK just beat Missouri on a TD pass on an untimed down with no time left.

Oregon State, down 34-3 at one point, comes back to tie Colorado 34-34 with 29 seconds left ... but misses the PAT.
Georgia's back
Well how about that ... https://t.co/t6aCAO8gjI

Just a reminder that the UCLA football game across town kicked off nearly 2.5 hours after the baseball game started and ended more than an hour ago.

Full Big Ten statement. https://t.co/u1o6MwU6dj
The Big Ten found a way to scold everybody involved in the Michigan-Michigan State stuff.  MSU fined $10,000.  Dantonio reprimanded for not taking action to stop it. Bush reprimanded for conduct. Harbaugh reprimand for comments.
But Jim Kelly told John Elway he was a good kid, and that's all he needed to hear. https://t.co/m0CJrSxy0X
@SmittyNDIrish_1 Are you kidding? It's going to be No. 1 vs. No. 4 in primetime.
@BruceWaTheTruth The stat is he's never lost by more than 14 points there, which is pretty incredible.

My goodness, look at that aerial shot at Wazzu. The entire crowd is on that field. Incredible.
Since the start of last season, Ohio State has wins over Penn State (twice), Michigan, Michigan State, Wisconsin &amp; USC ... and blowout losses to Iowa and Purdue.
If you told me Purdue would be leading Ohio State 28-6 in the fourth quarter I'd assume Buckeyes had five turnovers.  Try zero.  Purdue just taking it to 'em.
In other news, USC went up 14-0 on Utah. Utah is now winning 34-14.
I don't understand how the original tweet could prompt such an angry response. https://t.co/RTlfmkUEPA
I still don't understand how a recruit as talented as Rondale Moore wound up at Purdue, but it's more fun that he did.

I tried that. There are flights, but they leave at the wrong time to get there by kickoff. https://t.co/vuUYGq00Iv

@MattBrownCFB Game moved to El Paso for old time's sake.
Continue to be so impressed with Washington State QB Gardner Minshew. Cougs up 20-0 on the Ducks.
This is surely the longest laugh of Nick Saban's career. It's like he breaks character for a second. https://t.co/vnbfRj7bNc
Just your typical 15-play, 98-yard Purdue football drive against Ohio State.
Everything about that Washington State TD -- including Timmy B's call -- was amazing.

Florida State, which could barely figure out how to snap the ball a few weeks ago, goes up 27-7 on Miami. Not good, Mark Richt.

This is incredible. Texas looks like Oklahoma of the past few years. No mercy.
TEXAS IS BA ... no, too soon.

Lost in the rush to anoint this year's Alabama team as the GOAT -- its defense is definitely mortal compared to past seasons. Came in ranked 23rd. Arkansas has two 75-yard TD drives.
They're just messing with us now. https://t.co/zSKzmEPurS
Oh as if Alabama's not hard enough to stop, now they're fumbling 20 yards downfield for their own touchdowns.
They said Arkansas' QB fumbled, it was facing the other side of the field, I guess we'll take their word for it.

2017: Ohio St. 39, Penn St. 38 2018: Ohio St. 27, Penn St. 26  They certainly know how to entertain us.
McSorley looked to the sideline and checked out of the play twice. Play-clock nearly ran out. I'm thinking there was some sort of miscommunication. That can't possibly be the play Penn State wanted.
That was the play-call?
Ohio State just drove 96 yards in 2:32. Made it look easy. Wow.
Methinks Penn State is going to work on "defending the screen" in practice this week.
The refs have lost control of themselves.
McSorley: 15-of-29 for 259 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs. 20 carries for a career-high (by a lot) 147 yards.
Trace McSorley is having himself a GAME.
Well this escalated in a hurry.
Chase Young:  A sack, two pass break-ups (that last one was huge), two QB hurries. He &amp; Drue Chrisman are Ohio State's MVPs right now.
If you want to amuse yourself on a football Saturday, at any given time, do a Twitter search for "refs."
Look at the jets on KJ Hamler, my lord!
No possible way Penn State will come to regret having to settle for all these field goals, right?

Random thought: If Clemson loses to Syracuse again this year, the committee could rationalize it the same way as last year: Well, they didn't have Kelly Bryant.

More misused term at this point: RPO or "clickbait?" https://t.co/OpnBsAs5Op
Don't do this, kids. https://t.co/7eVIpnQ5T5
This ended up being an eerily similar comparison. Rodgers lost that game when USC kept him out of the end zone on 4 straight plays inside the 10 at the end. https://t.co/fW8KmBnzNq
Book it, Badgers.
Stanford with the interception on fourth down to seal it in overtime. Heck of a comeback by the Cardinal. But man, Oregon had so ... many .. chances to win.
The Stanford Volleyball Offense.
Stanford-Oregon turned into a heck of a game. And now it's heading to OT.
Oh no, Oregon!
Four games in, Stanford still can't open holes for Bryce Love. It's baffling. But KJ Costello throwing it up to Arcega-Whiteside/Kaden Smith remains extremely effective.
Stanford is a passing team now.
Anyone old enough to remember Aaron Rodgers' near-perfect 2004 game against USC?   Justin Herbert is having one of those games tonight against Stanford. 23-of-25 for 305 yards.
Three of the teams I was most impressed by last week: BC, Oklahoma State, TCU.  So of course they go 0-3 this week, with BC losing to Purdue and Ok St losing 41-17.
Bryce Love touchdown. This is wild. This game was about to be 31-7 Oregon a few minutes ago, now it's likely going to be 24-21.
This turned out to be correct. Pylon is out of bounds, ball hadn't crossed the goal. https://t.co/uifMSs6yUV
Quite the turn of events in Eugene. The Ducks appeared to go up 30-7, TD got wiped off on replay, Oregon fumbles, then fumbles again, Stanford scoops it and scores. Now 24-14.
Army's QB hit as he throws, Parnell Motley intercepts it and Oklahoma survives.
It's going to be 4th and 7 for Army at the 22.
Overtime is not ideal for Army. It's not like Army's been stopping the Sooners offense (8.9 yards per play), they were just able to keep it off the field.
But Kyler Murray turns around and throws a 10-yard TD to a wide-open CeeDee Lamb.
Not So Fast: Replay says OU receiver stepped out at the 10. No touchdown yet.
Scoop from @AriWasserman, Ohio State is in talks to make Ryan Day its Coach in Waiting.  (Free). https://t.co/GjzEI2OUJs
30-yard OU touchdown pass on its first possession of overtime.
Pay. Per. View.   I splurged beginning of the fourth quarter. https://t.co/c5ha12Drhf
Austin Seibert wide left from 33 yards.   OU and Army going to overtime.
HE MISSED IT
Murray just centers it and takes a knee with 2 seconds left. OU field goal will be from 33 yards.
Another Murray run, he slides and OU takes a timeout with 14 seconds left. Setting up for a likely game-winning FG try.
Mostly watching his defense from the sideline. https://t.co/hkRzu6DVF2
Another long Murray run when the play breaks down, Now inside the OU 30 with less than a minute left.
Kyler Murray with a 19 yard run and OU is already at the Army 43.
Look at all these tackles. https://t.co/cOmCiBxi0t
Oh no! Army throws the ball on third down, ball gets deflected and Oklahoma picks it off.
Have never seen this. https://t.co/mqFLmUSE8c
OU rises up with two straight tackles in the backfield. Now 3rd and 14 at the 34. Army calls time out. 2:23 left.
First down.  So far this drive: 12 plays, 64 yards, almost 9 minutes amassed.
Now to the Oklahoma 35. Under 5 minutes.
Army is doing its Army thing, picking up 3-5 yards per run. They've driven from the goal line to almost midfield. Now under 7 minutes.
OU, with modern passing guru Lincoln Riley, locked in a battle with a service academy that doesn't pass.  Can't see that on Sundays.
Oh boy. ... Reaching for credit card. https://t.co/9mkpAzhOQn
The only thing more incredible than Army possibly upsetting Oklahoma is that it's 2018 and this game is only available on PPV.
This is incredible. https://t.co/TIK8VAJMOm
JJ Arcega-Whiteside catches every jump ball. You can see it developing like it's slow motion and the DB still can't beat him.
Tennessee (five turnovers) is losing this game 33-3. https://t.co/qE9ia7w85j
Justin Herbert is hitting on everything and Oregon just went up 14-0 on Stanford.
Wisconsin-Iowa is just a whole other experience with Gus on the call. Every 3-yard gain is An Event.
Rocky Drop. https://t.co/4vBqxMITVJ
The UT Longhorns just went up 31-16 on TCU with three minutes left. This is going to be a big one for Tom Herman.
They started a freshman the first 3 games and were horrible.  They put this guy in and ... https://t.co/cl85Ah1jjK
Final: (Previously 0-3) Old Dominion 49, No. 13 Virginia Tech 35.
The ACC saw what the Big Ten did last week and said hold my beer.
.@ClemsonFB Where would you like your 2018 ACC trophy mounted?
Old Dominion throws in a looong TD when they were just running out the clock.   It's MONARCHY!!!
That'll likely do it. Throw in a Virginia Tech unsportsmanlike on Old Dominion's clinching first down.
Oh, it's still ridiculous. Against Old Dominion's backup QB no less. https://t.co/sBlHWTz25v
Bud Foster did lose a ton of guys this summer. FSU game fooled us into thinking they weren't affected. https://t.co/2bJR7RKpZr
This ... might happen. Virginia Tech, down 42-35, fails to convert a fourth down with 2:33 left. Old Dominion gets ball back, though Hokies have all 3 timeouts.
That is correct. Old Dominion relaunched its program in 2009. https://t.co/fdLTVge5aF
Jonathan Duhart is the guy who made this catch. https://t.co/zhNdPlBiz0
OH MY GOSH OLD DOMINION
They already agreed to go six more times! https://t.co/WvvsVQsmBZ
Ohio State just scored a very important TD with a minute left to go up 49-6.
Josh Jackson being taken to the locker room for X-rays on his ankle, per @CBSSportsNet
This is the team that is tied with No. 13 Virginia Tech in the fourth quarter. https://t.co/D5YCjXELeD
And now Hokies QB Josh Jackson hurt his ankle and is being helped off the field.
Easily the weirdest game right now: Virginia Tech tied 28-28 with 0-3 Old Dominion early fourth quarter.
LOL, that 57-yard Ruggs run counted as a TD pass for Tua.
@ChrisVannini RIP your mentions Chris.
Please keep Kellen Mond in your thoughts. He has now been sacked 10 times (and counting) in two games against Alabama.
@JerrodShook Hasn't everybody?
You can already see where Tua vs. Haskins could become a season-long Heisman debate. https://t.co/Wk7tOdp1Fn
Un. Fair. https://t.co/x9leZtGtkQ
What an insane stat. Texas just took its first lead on TCU since their 2013 game.
Mark Richt pulled Malik Rosier for Perry early in this game and I'm not sure Rosier is getting his job back. https://t.co/Wx2PHW9k7j
Trevor Lawrence just doinked a pass of the back of his O-lineman's head that Georgia Tech intercepted. But I think they'll be OK.
@ChphGomez Run Pass Option.
Do you think we'll ever return to a day when announcers don't feel the need to say "RPO" every time a QB passes instead of handing off or is this the new norm?
Kellen Mond. The guy is just so unaffected by pressure. Tie game.
It took two A&amp;M plays for Alabama to force a turnover and one Alabama play for Tua to throw a 30-yard touchdown.
Urban Meyer leading the Buckeyes onto the field as we speak.

Purdue, which came in 0-3, beats BC's first ranked team in 10 years 30-13. Boilers had lost 20 straight against ranked foes, per @starrettjason.
@smartfootball We've again reached that point in a program when it's five years after Petrino's hire and it's all his recruits. See: Louisville 2007, Arkansas 2012.
Nebraska scheduled that Bethune-Cookman game in hopes of getting to six wins but now I'm worried whether they'll win a game between now and then.
Your #GoACC update:  ND up 49-20 on Wake. Purdue up 30-7 on BC. Virginia up 20-3 on Louisville. UNC up 38-28 on Pitt.
I'm told in Vegas if one of the teams makes an unannounced QB change it nullifies the pick. https://t.co/3YWrnviLrN
Few things make CFB Twitter angrier than a guy prematurely dropping the ball on his way into the end zone.
I picked the wrong week to jump on the BC bandwagon. https://t.co/ChVdCyPg3F
Needless to say, ND looks like a much more potent offense with Ian Book. Up 28-13 at Wake.
Defensive touchdown, long INT return and now a blocked punt TD return for Georgia to go up 20-7 on Mizzou. Reminds me of 2016 Alabama.
Buffalo is sneaky good, but, ouch. https://t.co/ZmeiK4oCKH
@tigerernst40 @FauxPelini It's a satire column written by a fake football coach.

@joelklatt Props for coming armed with the numbers for that analogy.
Did Wake Forest’s kicker not realize it was fourth down?
Every time I watch Georgia I’m just blown away by the speed on both sides of the ball.
Animal House is the hook, but he’ll always be Alan Stanwyk to me.
“You’ll be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?”  “I rent them. I have a lease with an option to buy.”
Tim Matheson in Eugene?! Inspired guest pick, GameDay.
Clay Helton needed that one. And JT Daniels showed what the hype is about. ... but was also very impressed with Gardner Minshew. Wazzu will be a factor.
At 39-36, this is already the highest-scoring USC-Washington State game since 1973 (46-35 USC)
This Daniels kid is pretty darn good. ... and to think, he should still be in high school! (Kidding!)
Gardner Minshew is looking like one heck of a grad transfer pickup for Mike Leach. Looks so natural in that offense.
Illini came to play tonight. Penn State on the road up 21-17 at the half.
Lovie’s beard on a 60 inch TV is just breathtaking.

From @NicoleAuerbach's excellent Urban Meyer column today, this @brendatracy24 quote really stands out: “He’s fueling the fire of all of these people who think that domestic victims are liars, that we make stuff up. He is fueling all of these myths.”   https://t.co/ifuV0FgMKq
Agreed. We've seen more than our share of "football questions only" (Jameis for instance) over the years. https://t.co/W6HXnW0rfS
Urban describing at the end the conflict he had over disciplining Zach vs. wanting to help stabilize the family. Says he made the wrong decision.  It was the same thing with troubled kids at Florida. He defaults to thinking he can save people.
A reporter asked about the credibility of Zach and Courtney Smith.  His follow up was "How much better can this offense get?"  I about spit out my coffee.
I honestly wonder at this point if he even knows the definition of domestic violence. https://t.co/xbmWbdVdPN

This is turning into a bit of a meltdown for TCU.
Just realized ABC briefly showed the TCU return man laying in the end zone right before the kickoff. .. Guess no one looked up at the giant video board?
@johhay Correct. They would need to finish in at least the top 10 and be high enough to get picked as an at-large for Fiesta or Peach.

Holy Toledo. They're in this thing. 28-21 'Canes.
@jasonkersey I wrote some pretty dumb stuff for the college paper, but ...
Does FSU practice?
Oh dear lord, Florida State. 3rd and 10 from the Syracuse 20 with 11 seconds left, they complete a pass inbounds short of the first down ... and time runs out.
FSU's defense with a heck of a goal line stand. Syracuse's lead is only 6-0 despite 'Noles' complete offensive ineptitude.
Midway through the second quarter, FSU has gained 62 yards of offense while losing 52 penalty yards.
Troy 17, Nebraska 0.
Oklahoma has carried over some of those missed tackles from last year's Iowa State game to this year's. Now 10-10.

Ah, this helps explain Northwestern's offensive woes that past several years. https://t.co/7oph3r0Mgd
Holy moly. Nebraska and UCF both have a bye week Oct. 27.  Please make this happen. https://t.co/9Pqp9wioKN
The good news for UCF is that not playing the UNC game will actually help their schedule strength.
This is the third straight year UCF has had a game canceled or postponed due to a weather event. Second straight against an ACC team.
Both UCF-North Carolina and West Virginia-NC State have been officially canceled.
I eagerly await the Texas and Texas A&amp;M message board reactions. https://t.co/enLUCziEoI

@olevelo They played a Division II school.

Last night's column from College Station, where Jimbo Fisher and Kellen Mond managed to upstage Clemson even in defeat. https://t.co/llq4dohBrE
Herm Edwards just beat Mark Dantonio in his second game at ASU and maybe he really is a genius and I can’t believe I’m typing this.
Column from College Station, where the aftermath of a heartbreaking A&amp;M loss felt unusually upbeat.  https://t.co/llq4dohBrE
Can't let FSU hang around like that, Samford.
@rrman_64 Which week would the Mercer game fall?
Incredible. Never thought I’d see it. https://t.co/7wp4BxPdIw
As Jimbo ran off the field fans were chanting his name. He briefly waved but was shaking his head in frustration the whole way. He may be more crushed about the loss than they are.
If Kellen Mond’s night ends on an interception it’s a shame, because he has unquestionably stolen the show here tonight.
Wow
A&amp;M fans are chanting Jimbo Fisher’s name. Whether or not he wins this game, he’s won a lot of approval with this performance.
I came into this game thinking this would be Trevor Lawrence's breakout night but he's taken a backseat to not just Kelly Bryant but Kellen Mond.
Kellen Mond, ladies and gentlemen. Jimbo's got himself a QB.
All credit to Kelly Bryant. Big-time TD throw. Dabo keeps switching up the QBs and Bryant (7-10, 139 yards, 1 TD) at this point is arguably having a better game than Lawrence (5-9, 93, 1 TD).   21-6 Clemson.
Halftime: Clemson 14, Texas A&amp;M 3. Aggies gained 98 yards on their first two drives, looked good, then just 37 yards on the six possessions from there.
Clemson had Dexter Lawrence &amp; Christian Wilkins in as blockers on 4th down near the goal line, but Kelly Bryant fumbled the snap. A&amp;M ball.
Plus that spin move. https://t.co/GEpoePrvhr
Well that's a way to make an entrance. Trevor Lawrence's first pass is a 64-yard touchdown on a spectacular catch by Tee Higgins.
It's Trevor Time for Clemson.
Been really impressed w/ Kellen Mond so far. He's made some nice throws, looks very comfortable running the offense.  That said, Clemson up 7-3 after 1Q.
Meanwhile, Colorado, holy smokes do they have a star in WR Laviska Shenault. 11 catches for 211 last week, 10 for 177 this week.
Nebraska really could have used that Akron game last week. After 9 months of anticipation, Scott Frost era starts off at 0-1 &amp; with Adrian Martinez hurt.
Even that three-star general is embarrassed. https://t.co/WREPYAdwf8
The rain is coming down in College Station. But it appears they will still play football.
Kansas, up 28-7 at Central Michigan, is one quarter from ending its 46-game road losing streak.

It's been fun, Houston, but @max_olson and I are hitting the road for College Station. Hopefully don't miss a 31-point comeback.
We have a Quinten Dormady sighting in Houston. The Tennessee transfer getting in for the last series before halftime.
@dennisdoddcbs 3 tackles, 0.5 TFL
31-0 Houston. ... No longer worried about making to A&amp;M by kickoff.
Never underestimate the body clock. https://t.co/D6RNy7WFjL
Needless to say, the Kevin Sumlin era is off to a brutal start. Houston 48-yard TD catch by TE left wide open puts the Cougs up 21-0 4:43 1Q.
I'm starting to think my Arizona Pac-12 South pick isn't going to come through. @PeteThamel
Bad INT for Khalil Tate. Interesting to watch Houston move Ed Oliver around, he lined up at left end on 3rd down.
Nice opening 81-yard TD drive for Houston. QB D'Eriq King looked good; Arizona's defense did not.
You go, @MollyAMcGrath https://t.co/O83bLPzPCQ

Pretty bad yeah. Especially Cam Akers as QB. https://t.co/dYfbajQZln
The MVP of Week 1 might be Bud Foster. How many starters do you have to strip from that guy’s defense for it not to be awesome?
It was a horrible debut for Willie Taggart, but remember, he inherited an Independence Bowl team. It was never going to be an overnight fix. Especially that O-line.
It only gets better from here. https://t.co/bpZp8lIHyd
Midway through the third quarter, Virginia Tech already has 4 sacks and 12 TFLs. Living in FSU's backfield.
It's almost like Francois' injury wasn't the only reason FSU went 6-6 last year.
Indeed, @PaulMyerberg has won more college football trivia debates than anyone in history. https://t.co/iyKdTyVUVS
I love when ABC/ESPN show the full pregame ritual at these stadiums like Enter Sandman, running down the Hill at Clemson, planting the spear at FSU. Makes you feel like you’re there.

@ATVS_JakeNazar Completely false. Since you don’t have accurate info I’m going to end this here.
Michigan. Miami. Texas. UCLA. When eight months of anticipation give way to three-plus hours of cruel despair.  https://t.co/IuoEklb0xR

I'm here for @FauxPelini's live Sunday morning tweets of the not-rescheduled Nebraska-Akron game.

Maybe Notre Dame's going to win the national title, I don't know, but what a debacle of an opener for Michigan. New QB(s), same dreadful offense.
They're headed for the exits at the Rose Bowl. Cincinnati goes up 26-17 on UCLA with less than 2 minutes left.   And the truly bad news for Chip Kelly is he's got to play at Oklahoma next week.
All credit to Brandon Wimbush, penalty be damned. Michigan was in the backfield almost every snap of that drive and he made one big play after another. 24-10 Irish.
So  ... Cincinnati is up 19-17 in the fourth quarter at UCLA.
@bamaphiliac AJ was very good. This kid is special.
@ebgatsby Ok.
I mean seriously, Saban won five national titles w QBs like Matt Mauck &amp; AJ McCarron.   And THEN he added Tua.
Apt. https://t.co/4dLjW45qCj
After eight months of talking and writing about it, I neglected to have the TV on ABC when Alabama at long last disclosed its starting QB.
Notre Dame's D-front is swarming, and Michigan is blocking like .... it has for most of the last 5 years.
The recurring theme of Week 1: "INCREDIBLE CATCH!"
OK it's now sinking in how cool it is to have Michigan &amp; ND in prime time to open the season. (And not in an NFL stadium.)
Penn State interception in the end zone! Penn State survives.
Auburn-Washington was fun. Two great defenses. Will try hard not to overreact either way.
Yes. https://t.co/H9lGDtpIUM
TOUCHDOWN. ... But did they leave too much time for Trace McSorley?
In FG range.
App State takes over in Penn State territory, tie game, 2:59 left.
Tie game in Happy Valley. 6:03 left.  BTW, today happens to be the 11th anniversary of a certain App State-Big Ten game.
Oh my, Appalachian State. Incredible catch to set up 1st and goal, down 7 at Penn State.
