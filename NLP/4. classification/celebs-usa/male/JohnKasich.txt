On #NorthKorea, I'm glad we're going to talk. But you don't just go in there and do it from the seat of your pants. America's Intelligence community must have a seat at the table. https://t.co/TSyp6hFtHU
It’s time for conservatives to stop burying their head in the sand when it comes to climate change. Climate change is real. So, what are reasonable reforms to begin making a positive difference?  Looking fwd to discussing this and more with @UBC students on Tuesday! https://t.co/5MolZhf2WO

I am shocked and stunned that the left-wing of the Democratic Party succeeded in destroying 25,000 jobs for the people that live in New York City. https://t.co/che7tQTOaN
What a shame that 25,000 people are going to lose their opportunity in New York, because a bunch of people who are bitter about successful companies won the day.  https://t.co/nkgKbBVc2y
The President is right to sign the border compromise legislation. The courts must quickly review his dubious emergency declaration so that he and future Presidents are limited in their ability to declare national emergencies. https://t.co/Nzr1HqwrC6

Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Let’s remember that terrible time so that is never happens again and honor those who perished, those who survived, and all those who fought to free the persecuted.
Encouraging to see the president and legislative leaders finally put an end to their partisanship and find a path to reopen our gov't. True, lasting solutions require bipartisanship and America is hopeful that the conference cmte can set aside politics and put country over party.
To all of those on the front lines of this battle, keep up the good work.  It’s so encouraging to see new data showing Ohio with the biggest reduction in overdose deaths in the nation.   https://t.co/yjtUCQ0nAP

Both Republicans and Democrats are guilty of kicking the can down the road on deficit spending.    Our national debt is a serious problem. We need leaders who will treat it as such. https://t.co/VbimGgUpT5
Ohio has passed balanced budgets year after year, Washington – of all places – gets a pass. It’s the one place in America where they don’t have to worry about whether or not they spend money wisely, run programs efficiently or keep the deficit and debt in check. That must change. https://t.co/oMTQ5x0BML

Years ago we created the workforce board to make sense of an overly bureaucratic system, and they’ve come through in spades.

When Ohio’s workforce needs a boost as employer demands grow, our community colleges are incredible partners in making sure workers get the skills they need.

Our hearts are heavy for the victims of today’s hate-filled attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, for their families and for all who have been affected. I’ve ordered that all flags across the state of Ohio be lowered to honor those who perished today.
Honored that our capital is home to a national memorial that represents not only those who served, but the very idea of service.   https://t.co/qcIWH2donS

We are Americans by the grace of God. It could have been us marching North to save our children. We need to stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the plight of others different than us. https://t.co/4n325uufa1
I gave him every chance, but I've come to the conclusion that @realDonaldTrump is simply incapable of being a unifier or accepting any personal responsibility.  Americans deserve more -- so much more -- from a President. https://t.co/JGdpCgskUX

Good advice for Ohio employers. Prepping for the workforce of tomorrow requires knowing the in-demand jobs to come!  #IDJSurvey2018 https://t.co/wXJv6SiSvg
Furthermore, strong budgetary leadership has made expansion manageable and affordable – and will continue to be into the future. Read Budget Director Keen’s presentation here: https://t.co/im0leU3HkA #OhioMedicaidWorks
Also, the Medicaid Expansion report shows more parents found it easier to pay for food and shelter. And more found it easier to find and hold onto a job. https://t.co/im0leU3HkA #OhioMedicaidWorks
We also know 89 percent of expansion enrollees in 2016 had no health insurance at the time of their enrollment. In other words, employers aren’t transitioning their employees off their own plan so they can end up on Medicaid. #OhioMedicaidWorks
A new report out today shows an estimated 290,000 Ohioans utilized Medicaid expansion, and then transitioned off because they got a job or a raise. Expansion has worked in Ohio. https://t.co/im0leU3HkA #OhioMedicaidWorks

This morning, we’re headed to the Transportation Research Center, the largest independent testing facility in the nation to break ground on a new Smart Center that will make Ohio the go-to state for developing autonomous and connected vehicles.    Watch at https://t.co/1JuhjDIwUk
The United States must stand with our ally, the U.K., to bring those responsible for this terrible, barbaric death to justice. If Russia is found to have played a role, they must be held accountable.  https://t.co/xEf3kcRw3y
Excited to be heading back to the great state of New Hampshire AND honoring the First Amendment. A free press is vital to our country. @UnionLeader @LoebSchool - https://t.co/2NyjAwuxV6
Since the start of my administration, we’ve made it our goal to give Ohioans a fair shot at success – and with 520,000 new jobs, we’re making it happen. https://t.co/P04DhFKUFY

Luckily for the Russia national team and their fans, they won’t have to travel far after they suffer defeat to a talented Croatia squad. #CroatiaVsRussia  #WorldCup2018
Canada, Mexico, the European Union – these are our allies and partners. Tariffs are not the answer to trade issues. https://t.co/MeeOtuSFNR
This trade war will do more harm than good.   Read my latest piece in the Financial Times here:  https://t.co/ZAKV6wWQAs https://t.co/dqxjrw5YHy
Fixes to international trade rules can be pursued aggressively as well as constructively.  These tariffs are not constructive – they bring retaliation that hurts American workers. https://t.co/ZUAH6U1DVZ

One week since the tragedy at @capgaznews, and journalists across the country are observing a moment of silence to honor those lost.   We reflect and remember them – and honor their memory by fighting to prevent another tragedy like this from ever occurring. It’s time to act. https://t.co/KXRwPmNuvj
"America’s first war, for its independence, began with 'the shot heard  round the world.' Sadly, the latest one — a trade war supposedly in  defense of US economic independence — is beginning with a shot to the  foot."  Read my latest op-ed in the @FT here. https://t.co/sI1zdB2KiT
As you celebrate this #IndependenceDay, reflect on what makes this day so special. Every day as governor, I’m reminded of what makes our nation great: our communities, our care for one another, and the new heights we can reach when we work together. God bless. https://t.co/4SRPv5kkIi

“[We’ve seen] the government’s mechanized trampling of families only seeking our compassion. When things sink to that level, can we say that the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are, in fact, still real?”  https://t.co/vENt788UBR
The failure of leaders in Washington to act on issues as important as immigration is indicative of a much broader issue.   Read my op-ed in the @sfchronicle here: https://t.co/vENt788UBR

As the State of Ohio closes out its fiscal year today, I’m pleased to report that our budget is balanced and our fiscal position remains strong, which will allow us to build upon more than $2 billion in reserves.  We’ll have more good news to announce soon.
The priority along our border must be to reunite these families. We need to bring everyone together and deal with this in a comprehensive way – showing kindness and focusing on real solutions. #FamiliesBelongTogether

Today the CBO announced the federal debt is headed for its highest levels since World War II.  As I’ve long been saying, if we don’t take action, debt levels will hurt future generations and strangle economic growth. https://t.co/wfzL9f5BYF

As children, these people didn’t choose to come to America -- and as adults they’ve followed the rule of law, raised families, worked hard and contributed to society – making America stronger.   Enough games. Let’s get this done. https://t.co/RzOOxEIvQN
We should not give anything away to #NorthKorea. We have to keep the pressure up until we get verifiable results. This has to be for real gain and not a PR show. Anything less weakens the United States. https://t.co/EzCIKllbr1

A sad and shameful end to the #G7Summit with America again standing alone while our allies fill the vacuum of leadership in our absence. "America Alone" is America weakened and is a policy we must challenge.

Miracle and Sanderson are heroes.     Human trafficking is an overlooked crime, but it’s happening right now. If something seems suspicious, speak up — say something. When we come together with each other’s best interests in mind, we’re stronger. https://t.co/Sq4vQ5EUCk
I support these bipartisan efforts to address a fair solution on DACA and border security. They're on the right track &amp; I encourage the administration to support this work. https://t.co/2QzEZj8mYM
Ohio is working to prepare for our future place in the global knowledge economy. I shared our perspective from here in the Buckeye State with Le Monde. https://t.co/Kmnr5JE87G
The loss of life in Florida is such a tragedy. When a child is taken too soon, each family loses a lifetime of smiles, tears, laughter and love. And as a nation, we lose a piece of ourselves. We should all keep these families in our prayers.
Fixing DACA should take congress 6 minutes, not 6 months. It's time for them to step up, get it done, and send it to the President's desk to sign. https://t.co/SqSVuYWFC1

I've spoken with Westerville's city leaders and Chief Morbitzer and pledged whatever support they need from the highway patrol. We extend our prayers and deep condolences to their families and fellow officers.  Let’s pledge ourselves to never forget their service. (2/2)
The finest among us are those who risk it all everyday for our safety, and Officers Anthony Morelli and Eric Joering were those people. Their deaths are a terrible tragedy for my hometown of Westerville and all of Ohio.  (1/2)
We will learn more soon about this tragic incident but please join me in lifting up these officers' families in prayer. (2/2)
I am very saddened to learn of the deaths of two of my hometown police officers today.  I have spoken with Westerville city leaders and pledged the full assistance of the Ohio Highway Patrol in any way they need. (1/2)

The independent investigation into Russia’s meddling in our election must continue unimpeded by outside forces from either Congress or the President.  Do you agree? https://t.co/ZbWj78L1zS https://t.co/Nbohnb7Pqw
America's partisan divide is growing each day. It's unconscionable that our national security and justice system are being used as political footballs.   It threatens our democracy, emboldens America’s enemies and furthers the political divide. Agree? https://t.co/ZbWj78tqbi https://t.co/lzlaf2Nsvy

7 years ago, Ohio was reeling. 350,000 jobs had been lost &amp; our budget was busted.   Today, things look a lot different. Our budget is balanced and jobs continue to grow.   This final year in office, we’ll continue working every day to keep that progress going. https://t.co/5sl3fb6skT
It’s time to quit looking backwards and trying to punish Dreamers, people who came to this country as children — no fault of their own. Let’s move forward — allow them to stay here with their spouses, their children — then let’s take on border security. https://t.co/lxwniS7VZr
Proud to once again join @GovofCO to show the spirit of bipartisanship is strong.   Congress needs to show America it’s possible to reach across the aisle and do some good for so many.  We need a fix for DACA and CHIP. We need it now. https://t.co/rNvHdfKHYJ

The Senate must pass a clean DACA bill immediately, then send it to the House and the President. Enough is enough. We can’t continue to hold these Dreamers hostage.
It’s time for Republicans to stand up against the president’s absurd and derogatory remarks. We can’t afford to lose the soul of our Party. #CountryOverParty
The President’s comments were absurd and deserve to be condemned. But don’t let them distract from the important issues at hand. There are 800,000 Dreamers worried if tomorrow will be their last day in America. They need our help. https://t.co/bKSC7UYfh5
The President’s comments were absurd &amp; inappropriate and he should apologize. https://t.co/yJjU0cxVMe
