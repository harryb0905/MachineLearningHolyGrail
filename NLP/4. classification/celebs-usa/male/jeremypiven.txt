.@iTunesTV Thank you for hosting me! It was a pleasure. Catch up on season 1 with the iTunes Pass #SelfridgePBS #AskPiven
.@BrendanScannell @Sonos has changed my life. Even a tech dummy like me can listen to music in any room in my house. It's a dream. #AskPiven
.@kepianko make sure you have to do it before you begin. Get as much experience on the stage and in front of camera. Good Luck. #AskPiven
.@funnell Drummer. Dream gig would be @foofighters or @GaryClarkJr. Would have to practice...for years and years #AskPiven
.@SophieeLLouisee brilliant actress. brave. Gives Harry's wife so much depth and integrity #AskPiven #SelfridgePBS
.@iamLAC_iamATL you can win a Mr. Selfridge set visit by donating to @piventheatre http://t.co/CCF3nmei9n
.@LeeCooper85 Being a drummer, I have heros like Keith Moon, a brilliant man who played by his own rules. Would love to play him. #AskPiven
.@redcarol57 don't think drama and comedy should be thought of separately. Can coexist as is the case of #MrSelfridgePBS season 2 #AskPiven
.@becki4jb British audience has taken to the show like gangbusters way ahead of the American audience #AskPiven @masterpiecepbs
.@veejpatel_ the great @domenicovacca did Entourage series and film. Not only an amazing designer, also a gentleman #AskPiven
.@melissa_friend have to grow my beard the minute Entourage Movie wraps. Praying to Testoterone Gods to grow a beard in ten days #AskPiven

.@iTunesTV don't have a lot of endurance for shopping. That's why I have such resepct for what Harry did. Making shopping an event #AskPiven
.@iTunesTV starts five years later w/ Great War as backdrop. Store is being celebrated, but it's a shallow victory w/o his family #AskPiven
.@iTunesTV the finale of season 2. I've never received that type of response from anything I've done in my entire career #AskPiven
.@iTunesTV we both needed to convince the brits to trust in us. No one does period drama better than they do #AskPiven #MrSelfridgePBS
.@iTunesTV nerve-wracking, nerves are just an energy. Make friends with it and get out of your own way, and anything is possible #AskPiven
.@iTunesTV The real Harry Selfridge was a lover of "Putting on a Show." Retail was his theatre, so I'm trying to be true to that #AskPiven
.@iTunesTV it's a true story that plays out like a Greek tragedy. And yet, it's still both funny and beautiful #AskPiven
