@BSO @CKidd206 U better believe I’m doing everything in my power to get thrown off that jury. Fuck that. Fuck around n light a joint in the courtroom. I’ll take that few days in jail.

@6BillionPeople aight cool thanks bro. One last question. Will I get the predictions at $2 or should I go for the $5 tier?
@6BillionPeople hey where can I follow u to get all your buy n sell advice? I thought twitter and the follow coin app were it but I’m not seeing too much advice. Thanks!!
@BSO bro I really enjoy your content but the ads on your page are killing it. I can’t look at anything without having to wait for numerous ads to load that take over the whole page. On mobile less than half the page is even viewable with all the ad spam going on.
When will you condemn Roy Moore for the same accusations? It’s a two way street. Not just the people you don’t like. https://t.co/q1a4o4PxgS

Who cares that people r threatened to be fired if they won't work on T-day. At wages that r sposed to be higher but really aren't.
More and more people end up on the news dead or shot or stabbed.

We as humans need to be better. But we won't as long as it's still cool to be arrested because U got ur video on YouTube.
This is the most pathetic holiday "tradition" in America and needs to be stopped. It starts w the consumer.
And honestly anyone that I think is a friend that is willing to wait in line for hours is no longer a friend of mine. Seriously pathetic.

@YoungPlatinum I don't know u
@ticktock6 power in residential also tends to be underground. That is low and could easily be touched by someone. Safety first!!
@ticktock6 but I'm no electrician so don't run up touching it on my word. Maybe a better pic of the lines would help
@ticktock6 far as I can tell that's not power. Looks like cable or phone. Power would be much higher and if it was that tree would be gone

@RedsArmy_John and media shoving a mic in his face doesn't count. Just sayin how he feels he won.
@RedsArmy_John I prolly did more preaching in 10 mins than he has done in 6 straight come from behind win.
@RedsArmy_John when has he ever preached. He doesn't go outta his way. Belittle anyone else. Plays hard. Prays hard. Wins games. That's it.
@tymesrhymes I guess that's the best we got. Not sayin bears r atheist but some show it and some don't. Seems to be a formula to win
@CardboardGerald #turrable
@CardboardGerald hahahahahahahaha
@tymesrhymes u don't see cutler or whoever prayin do u. God rewards those that live for him. Tebow lives for gods glory. Not his own.
Everyone wants a role model but when a legit good one comes everyone hates. Wtf.
I'd rater score 5 a game w a ring than score 25 and be on a losing team.
No one said shit when Sosa did his lil home run kiss to god. But he had stats. stats don't fucking matter. Wins do.
Tebow is a cultural phenom. To the point where #tebowing is the new #planking. Y hate on him for that. I don't hear haters on plax for guns.
@tymesrhymes do the bears say a small prayer at all times possible. Dude believe wat he does and it shows in the way they keep winning
@_Lenito exactly. Dudes a winner and is a good human being. This is ur role model kids. Not Rick Ross n shit.

@WutsAllThisThen @PatNoonan2 what r "the bulls"
@_Lenito @WutsAllThisThen i get depressed everytime i look at my twitter
@WutsAllThisThen @_Lenito how the fuck can u not cover 15.5 points after a bye week??!??!?
@_Lenito @WutsAllThisThen same goes for u buddy. 1 more outburst n ur goin w all the spam bots straight to twitter hell
@RedsArmy_John valiant effort
@WutsAllThisThen i will block u if we have another outburst like that
@RedsArmy_John it would be disrespectful for me to vomit tho. i HATE licorice. so thats out
@RedsArmy_John hahaha yet to have any at all. doesnt it taste like licorice?
@RedsArmy_John 3am. i got insomnia issues.
@RedsArmy_John front wheel drive 4-bangers they drive aint gonna make it up that w a layer of snow.
@RedsArmy_John hahaha it aint that bad. more along the lines of Charlotte. no snow tho cause these streets r as hilly as SF and these lil
@RedsArmy_John nope. right on the Aegean. lil north tho. been gettin nippy here.
@Daoud_S obv
@RedsArmy_John Kavala. bout 1hr from thesaloniki.
@RedsArmy_John hahaha ive had 4 drug tests in greece in 2 mths. everyone would know if i did. they dont play w that shit here. instant cut
@RedsArmy_John or higher. and as soon as Philip Morris starts slingin em like cigs the economy would be back in 10 yrs.
@RedsArmy_John oh ya i fully agree. i personally dont smoke but i would vote to legalize. imagine wat we could make off a nice 10% tax
@RedsArmy_John u need to be moved to the front of the line. also would free alot of innocent people due to DNA
@RedsArmy_John exactly. i think every pending death penelty needs to be re-tried w currrent systems also. if u cant prove innocence now
@RedsArmy_John stop w these life sentences for a certain level of criminal
@RedsArmy_John i see wat u r sayin. and theres def no perfect system. this is just the way i feel would be best. if not pub i would say at
@RedsArmy_John highest caliber. not just hearsay. 1 accuser v. 1 accusee. need multiple HIGHLY credible witnesses. DNA or Video proof.
@RedsArmy_John and there would be a ton of rules for conviction at this level. like a whole new level of guilt. Video/testimony/DNA of the
@RedsArmy_John but yes also. the worst serial rape/torture/murderer will be publicly executed.
@Daoud_S the amount of cocaine in attendance would make Escobar blush
@RedsArmy_John far to soft for the level of crime commited today.
@RedsArmy_John im not sayin harsh but we need to show kids wat paths they r going down a lil more pointedly. i think the justice system is
@RedsArmy_John i also wanna bring back public execution but thats a argument for another time
@RedsArmy_John soaked em in gas. match. poof. millions of dollars saved.
@RedsArmy_John but like these dudes in Conn that burned that family. shoulda just walked em out to the back of the courthouse and
@RedsArmy_John not every. cases will be reviewed w modern forensics. DNA and all that.
@RedsArmy_John its called population control. start thinning the heard. all those lifers that r dead to rights. the dudes who wanna be there
@RedsArmy_John we as americans need to save money. prison system is a perfect way to do that. and not by releasing these nickel n dimers
@Daoud_S ahahaha
@RedsArmy_John pedos murderers and rapists.
@RedsArmy_John y waste money on this asshole w the prison system. as long as its a fair trial w DNA evidence i say just kill these fuckers.
@_OrlandoNetto no #merica
@RedsArmy_John needs to be the finality of this shit
@RedsArmy_John if by suffer u mean a broom stick up his ass to experience wat those poor kids did then yes suffer he must. but a bullet 1/1
dude needs to rent a gun and buy a bullet and kill himself and save the tax payers the trouble
kinda obv he coerced the kids into those showers. and wtf r u doing "hugging" a naked 8 yr old thats not ur fuckin child?
horsing around w 8 yr old boys in the shower? when i was 8 there was no way i was takin shower in a public place. wtf kinda excuse is that?
@Daoud_S that I do not know. I'm just givin my opinion. I'm a poker player and I know u don't always hafta have the best hand to call bluff
@Daoud_S I think 1 yr lost is less than 10 yrs of terrible circumstances. Especially comin off of a record setting season w attendance.
@Daoud_S the way it sounds if we decert the season is lost anyways.
@Daoud_S @KBergCBS we aren't the only ones losing money in this. Owners now have 400mil paperweights basically. I say call bluff.
