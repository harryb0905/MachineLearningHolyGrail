@sjbrownie That's funny that you say that because I get so motivated by that movie.  I know, I know, you're just doing your part.

Recovery day today....easy day in the gym, stand in the river, then massage tonight.
@RebeccaKelley12 No, unfortuantely not.  I left at the beginning of June back to Calgary.  Why, what's up?
@chadhedrick What's up buddy!  How's training?  I'm back in Calgary and was on ice for the first time since surgery yesterday.
First day pushing on ice today.  Exceeded my expectations!!!
@mykellesabin thank you! You're the best friend ever!! :)
It's slowly coming!!! Hang cleaned 140k, sprinting felt good, and started to squat again. It's been a long time coming!
@therealpickler mine would be to read minds.....would make life a lot simpler!!

@alisonoverholt was #1 world in '07 to battle my way back on team this year. Had 2 major hip surgeries and lost all my income this past fall
@alisonoverholt Training is g8. training in Calgary for the indoor ice push track. we do all off ice training in summer. Been a tough year
Good day training, running was average but weight room was good. Rest of day is eating, sitting in the river, guitar lesson, and massage.
@alisonoverholt I hope the OLY channel is successful, would be nice to have fans following us outside of Olympic year.
Last day of recovery week, then weekend off - going to enjoy it.  Hit it hard next 3 weeks, a little over 2 months before selections start.
Stampeding in Calgary...well sort of. Just people watching
@ultimatestamina sounds like a familiar story.  I hope things go well for you and don't let anyone or anything detract you from your dream!
Listening to "Beat It" by Michael J....classic!!

Light GS day today getting ready for a big day training tomorrow.  Then off to Colorado Springs for our week long team camp on Friday.
@littlemyty it's funny that you just wrote me, I was just thinking about you the other day.  How are you doing?
@jaimewhittier Thanks, it's been a long and tough road but worth it.  I'm getting anxious for the season to come.
Great workout today.  Getting stronger and faster every week.  Less than 3 months until selections start.
@anastasiabucsis yep.  There's one on 4th but I go to the one on Bowness in Montgomery. Tarras is the owner, tell him ur an athlete.

@jheskett JOE!!!  Good to see you on here. Welcome!
I love recovery weeks, 4 day training week....awesome!
SERIOUSLY!!!  It's supposed to snow this weekend.  Welcome back to Calgary, I want to go back to San Diego!
it's so nice to be back in Calgary training with my training group.  It feels like home!
AND they have penguins here. Why??? There are no penguins in Calgary and people don't live in igloos either in Canada
At San Diego airport, on the first flight to Calgary of the year- it's a big deal! They're serving us food here at the gate, buffet style
@BrookeBurkhalte haha, normally not in my diet, but the food is getting sketchy here so I have to get creative.
Is it bad that a staple of my diet here at the training center has been peanut butter, banana, honey sandwiches? Food can be rough here.
Packing today for the move to Calgary tomorrow.
Tough day, need a little more time in between hard runs to let my hip recover.  Officially done in SD, a new chapter begins next week.
last training day in San Diego with Dan.....got to make it my best yet.  Have 90's today in spikes, the first time since September.
Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under: #athlete, #olympian, #bobsledder
4 days and counting until I'm back to Calgary. I've been in SD 8 months, the longest I've been in one place in 6 years
@Jennifer_L sweet!  I actually live in Calgary in the off-season training.  Most of my training group consists of the canadian bobsledders.
@sjbrownie I love grape slurpees, such a waste of 2 good drinks.
@Jennifer_L of course, I played football at Toledo.  Are you from there?
I wonder why I keep losing my income....sucks!!
80% running....super stoked!!
@sjbrownie rumor has it you're not running as much as you should.
A beautiful day in SD, only one week left before I head back to Calgary.  Should be a good week training after seeing my doc last week.
Are you kidding me!!  LeBron is amazing, another Akron boy.
@sjbrownie well...I don't want to toot my own horn, but I'm kind of a big deal :) haha. good seats but not that good
Heading to LA shortly for Lakers game.  I'm still a Cav's fan though, I have to be I'm from Ohio
@raneycat you here at the OTC?
On my way back to San Diego, then to LA tomorrow to go to the Lakers game
I can't believe Mandy Hunsicker is actually following me now.  Apparently she's a pretty big deal!!
seeing Dr. Philippon in about 3 hours.  It's beautiful here in Vail.
Sitting in the San Diego airport waiting for my flight to Vail.  Off to see my doc, let's hope he works his magic again!!
135k clean and 183k in the dead lift this week.  Moving on up!!!  Maybe it was because I was in LA, maybe I should move there....?
In LA for the weekend. I love this town!!
On my way to Universal Studios to film a spot for ESPN.  I'll send pics if I can.
Is in LA doing a bobsled commercial for ESPN.
Another beautiful day in SD.  Another shot in the hip, 4 weeks=4 shots.  Training is going to be amazing today!!
@estefanialalala stop it!!  we had this conversation earlier today.  GO TO BED!
@sjbrownie haha, classic!  If you have an extra one, I'll take yours.
If I quit, however, it lasts forever.  - Lance Armstrong
Pain is temporary. It may last a minute or an hour or a day or a year but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place
FRUSTRATED!!!
Great day in the weight room, cleaned 120k and tripled 170k deadlift.  My hip is coming back.  Praise God!!!
Awesome day of running today, actually felt normal.  The best feeling I've had in months!!
@BrookeBurkhalte thanks!  I'll check them out.
I wonder if all these injections I'm getting for my hip under x-ray is bad for me?
I don't like my hip and my hip doesn't like me.  Going to make it do what I want with a little capsaicin.  It's like an hot iron on skin.
is inspired by kind words.
Good day of training, hip was a little sore but productive.  Glad I saw Dr. Philippon last week, great hip doc!!
Another beautiful day in San Diego, off to training shortly.  This beats the snowstorm in Vail last week.
@alisonchurch that was part of my problem for my first surgery, also had torn labrum, bone chips, and a bone spur.
Seriously snowed in, in Frisco, Colorado.
Snow, snow, and more snow in Vail. Supposed to get 36". Kinda diggin' it.
Vail 23 degrees, San Diego 76 degrees.  What would you choose?  I'm out of here Saturday
Dr. Philippon is amazing!!!
On my way to Vail to see my doc.
Had an amazing time in NYC filled with exotic people, secret trap doors, and underground restaurants.
@estefanialalala I don't know, my friend had it. It was classic, you make a call and a secret door opens.
I just entered a club in NYC through a phonebooth, using a secret password.
In NYC for the weekend to see some friends.
In ohio frustrated with my hip. Seeing Dr. Philippon in Vail on Tuesday for a follow up.
@toraharris looks so nice and warm there.  It's snowing here in Ohio, so no track workouts for me.
I had a great evening tonight, was inducted into my high school hall of fame.
It's nice to be back in Ohio visiting my family
Back home in Ohio for a week after an 11 hour travel day.
In LA for the day, got worked on and my hair snipped.  Good day!
Leaving for LA for two days, then home to Ohio for a week.  It will be a nice and needed break.
Is going to bed and is slightly drugged because of my hip.  Off to LA tomorrow!!
Going to listen to  Lee Strobel speak at church.
Met the VP of Disney today at the training center. Pretty cool
@estefanialalala some people are leaving now or already left.  I'm leaving with brian in about 45. See you there. U have extra suntan lotion
heading to Mission beach for the bar-b-q, i think with most of the training center. Should be good times.
Was rollin' today in sprints, at about 70%.  Was awesome!!
The body continues to amaze me at what it can do and how it can recover.
Off to breakfast, feel much better than I did after afternoon training.  Should be a good day.
Exhausted from training, Dan's doing his job well.
I feel lighter
Why does it seem like whenever I wake up it feels like I just went to bed? Not sleeping well lately
Good day of sprinting today, off to the weight room then a not so enjoyable massage.
Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under:  #bobsledder #Olympian #athlete
@estefanialalala Hope you have fun with your bro
Today was another good day of training, felt like I sprinted today. The last 2 days make the last 6 months of pain and frustration worth it.
I love days like today, they're so encouraging!!
Good day of running, it's amazing what 4 advil can do for a surgically altered hip.  Guess I can stop taking the Vicodin.
Hip is a little stiff today as normal, but off to rehab then morning training.
@NikNewman Nice to meet you as well.  Yeah it's really nice down here, I'm training and rehabbing with Dan Pfaff.  Where are you?
@littlemyty what do you love?
@ginnyleess I'm at the training center in Southern Cal.  I'm not a summer athlete, I'm a winter one - a bobsledder.
@mikeyoung I'll tell Dan tomorrow.  I head back to Calgary in May to rejoin my training group.  Mes is my training partner. You went to FL?
Just finished a 5 1/2 hour training day, off to the cold tub and i'm done for the day
@toraharris I know, not sure what their deal is.  Maybe it's the food.
Done with training for the day, was a good one.  Seen Michael Phelps a lot here at the training center.  The whole swim crew is here
Exhausted from training, going to bed.  Is it bad if my hip hurts every time I move it?
@mikeyoung thanks for the message.  In SD working with Dan he's doing amazing things with me.  Mes and I were on the same sled in torino
Morning training/running was good, but my hip aches like a motha!!  To the weight room next, looking for a PR in the hang snatch.
3am, just got home from LA.  Off to bed, then early morning training.
Just had some delicious sushi at katseya in LA, my favorite place
@estefanialalala yep, it was really good. You been there? Did you go skydiving today?
Going to church in LA then back to San Diego
@toraharris oh man that website is really out of date.  Need to work on that.  Have a much better suit now though.
@estefanialalala have fun!!!!
Just had a nice dinner at Roy's in LA
Off to LA for the weekend
Trying to muster up enough enery to go train. Really tired at the end of the week, and this is my recovery week.
Off to the track, going to run faster than I did Tuesday.
Learning to play my guitar, it's my therapy from training and rehab.
Having a rest day from training
