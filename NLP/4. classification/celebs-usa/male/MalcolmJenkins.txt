These types of encounters create so much fear and anxiety, even for black people who haven’t experienced it. Fear that for any small thing you can be terrorized, manhandled, criminalized, and even worse killed. Constantly having to choose between your life and your dignity https://t.co/6kv90f11nz

The bigger problem is that these actions teach our kids something. They teach that boy that his life doesn’t matter. That we don’t mind ruining your life with a record so long as we can control you. And for the kids watching, never step out of line or this can be you!  At age 11
In a institution of learning you punished an 11 year old for having an independent thought. Punished him not with detention or suspension, which would’ve still been wrong, but by arresting him, charging him, and hauling him off to Juvie. All because he disagreed with a substitute https://t.co/q1qSr6ZwJX

The 5,000 children currently serving time in ADULT PRISONS are disproportionately represented by black and brown bodies. We must face the raw truth about the treatment of black in brown kids in our educational system and our justice system. The are our future #SchoolsNotPrisons
Our shameful practices highlight our struggles &amp; failures as a country to overcome our issues of racism. The glaring disparities that exist in how we treat children of color should be embarrassing. A black child is 5x’s as likely to be detained/incarcerated than their white peers
We deny our young quality education and opportunity then punish them for not finding a way to overcome their challenging circumstances. We waste money punishing kids who need restoration, healing, and education.
While @KingJames is investing in our youth with his school, our government is pushing our youth into into a cyclical justice system and denying the opportunity for education and enrichment. @playercoalition #thefightcontinues https://t.co/n1GxTZhzvG

If you paid your debt, you deserve a second chance. Ronald's story is a testimonial to how #CleanSlatePA would help people with minor and old records in PA. https://t.co/8FZNZ1rn2O #YesOnCleanSlate
1 in 3 Pennsylvanians have a criminal record.  #CleanSlateAct (HB 1419/SB 529) automatically seals records for non-violent misdemeanors past 10 years.  People deserve a 2nd chance to get a job, education, home. #PAHouse, #PASenate @GovernorTomWolf - push #CleanSlateAct through.
Ending mass incarceration starts at the local level. No single person has a bigger role to play than your District Attorney. That's why we hosted D.A. forums in Sacramento and Alameda. California – get out and #VOTE today for reform minded prosecutors. #cjreform #launchingjustice

Do you know who your district attorney candidates are? DA's determine who is prosecuted, who gets the death penalty, and whether or not minors get tried as adults. I can't stress their importance enough.

@coalitionplayer @DougBaldwinJr @RSherman_25 @j_bademosi24 Your vote MATTERS! #Cali mail-in ballots start 5/8. District attorneys hold immense power and YOU vote them in. They determine who is prosecuted, whether to seek the death penalty, and whether a young person will be tried in the adult system.
@coalitionplayer @DougBaldwinJr @RSherman_25 @j_bademosi24 District attorneys have the power to hold police accountable (or not) and to correct the racial disparities in police arrests. Think #stephonclark.  We plan to address this on May 10-11 with @SacCountyDA @PhilipsforDA @PPriceCares @NancyOmalley #LaunchingJustice

So the next time you have a conversation about race, dont get defensive because you are afraid of seeming racist. You dont HATE black people... we get it! Now lets talk about how you/we all contribute to the way things are when we refuse to acknowledge/ address the problem. https://t.co/TkF8ouF2NX
People get more upset at me for pointing out the BLATANT racial disparities in our country than they are about the disparities existing in the first place. Our prisons, our schools, poverty, brutality, crime... all disproportionately anchor black people. https://t.co/4RsYMdprqg
My message is not about America's hatred for Black people, as Im hopeful that the majority of Americans dont HATE black ppl, my message is about America's long history of mistreatment of black people and how we refuse to acknowledge/address it. https://t.co/sHYANfDLk3
@cdespo23 The color of the violator doesnt matter to me... I was drawing attention to the color of the victim which all too often is BLACK. Never said the cop was racist. What I said was that we've seen ARMED WHITE MURDERERS arrested with their lives, bodies, and pride intact. Why is that?
As a man who has two daughters I would lose my mind if they were ever handled like this by ANY man, let alone the Police!  We’ve seen mass murderes handled with more decentcy than that. Yet of course they were also white 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/fOU78njqW8

@bm4087 My parents were parents. And I still got in multiple fights. Doesn’t make them bad parents nor did it make me a bad kid. I was learning what I could and couldn’t do.... growing up!
@vmlknight @hamzasi34601506 And my point is that it’s a horrible policy for a middle school aged kids. It’s not even worth the time for the police. Now they are forced to carry out a “protocol “ that makes no sense at all with no regard to the damage this will do to a child.
What she needed was to hear from those responsible for her growth and development that she is a QUEEN with so much to offer the world that she can’t risk her potential by doing things that will ,at a later age, forfeit your freedom. She is far too important to US to allow that.
Kids will always make mistakes! And it is in my opinion that common sense should be used when handling our children. An 11 year old girl doesnt need to be arrested, hand cuffed, and put in a cell. And already is walking around with an arrest record.
I have great parents, together they have raised 3 sons. At the age of 11 I got in a fight on a bus on the way to school. It was broken up. I was taken to school and immediately suspended. Lesson learned, no Police were necessary ... I was 11!!
Y are adults calling the police on 11 year old children? We treat our black babies like grown adults. We peg them as criminals. Exposing them to a  justice system that is built to keep you stuck under that one label for life-Criminal. Let  kids be kids https://t.co/6RQH88jEqe

@D0ubletap @SandtIv any suggestions?
@D0ubletap @SandtIv all you gotta do is listen. The message is there...presentation might not be the best, but the message has been the same
@SandtIv @D0ubletap when I hear black power I think of an even playing field equal to that of any other color. You see a fall, I see a rise
@SandtIv @D0ubletap the difference is that white ppl have always been in power. So when you hear "black power" you think of a loss of power
@SandtIv @D0ubletap power to the ppl! white power to white ppl, brown power to brown ppl, black power to black ppl. ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏻
@D0ubletap how so?
@RAGU2708 there is nothing racist about raising a fist. I actually encouraged my white teammates to raise theirs along side of me. 🤷🏾‍♂️✊🏿✊🏼

@jdneal22 there is a bill in PA called the Clean Slate Act. I've been supporting it. I think it's a step in the right direction.
@CaitJTaylor I agree 💯

I appreciate this bro https://t.co/xBII2Tcp0Q
@PhillyGameday did you read the transcript that I just posted? He said he supports protest that come with community action (Kap)
@MJBestAllAround I see why u wouldn't like him bringing up Vick. But there was no coded language about IQ. Just the process of evaluating
@PhillyGameday you are completely right. I say it all the time that Kaep sparked the protests and movement. But that's not what he was asked
@KouroshSafavi @Eagles that quote is actually inaccurate

"If you want to make a permanent change, stop focusing on the size of your problem and start focusing on the size of you!"
But people DO NOT rest until justice and love have won. Keep pushing, keep resisting, keep enduring..I pray that God sustains you! #1love ✊🏿
I pray that those in positions of power and leadership use their stations to push love and justice to victory so that the people may rest.
I pray for those who continue to push and pull for love and justice. May God watch over you and protect you.
I pray for those who have been injured or have lost their lives, finding themselves caught in a war between love and hate

@ebayjohnson13 @yadz20 but HOW do you justify a man already surrendered in custody being mauled by a dog while two officers hold his leg?
@ebayjohnson13 @yadz20 im not mad that he was arrested. If you break the law you should be.
@jdneal22 don't u see a man handcuffed, in a submissive posture, verbally surrendering being mauled by a dog while cops hold him down?
@JAE_LENS until actions by bad cops are seriously/justly punished there will continue to be a lack of trust  in our law enforcement
@JAE_LENS but there is a problem. Police brutality is bad enough, but when it happens without consequence it is a direct threat to justice!
@JAE_LENS I never said that all of them were like this and I have multiple times, posted positive posts on the cops that are doing it right.

@HeathEvans44 and so when you see things that are going on now, it only makes you feel like we haven't come that far.
@HeathEvans44 it explains why for so long people of color have had this tension with law enforcement. It has been used as a tool against us
@HeathEvans44  what I think you are missing is the FACT that police departments originated as slave hunters... It is important to know that

.@DeweysDawgs If you're getting ready to justify or shift blame for slavery in America please spare me the headache 🤕
@DeweysDawgs and that what he said lacked proper context, accuracy, and sensitivity ... that's all
@DeweysDawgs if you agree with everything I said then you agree that I don't have an issue with the fact that he used the word immigrant
I couldn't ask for a better teammate! @connorbarwin98 has been a leader not only on our team but… https://t.co/JLJU3Womkb
@DeweysDawgs it is a huge mistake to gloss over that distinct difference between willing immigrants and slavery when referencing history
@DeweysDawgs to say they came here with a dream is not true. They came here living their worst nightmares and survived long enough to dream
@DeweysDawgs to say that slaves worked for "less" was an understatement. They worked for free... for their LIVES!!!
@DeweysDawgs it wasn't just the word "immigrants" that got Ben in trouble. More so the lack of differentiating slaves from normal immigrants

@JoelHartranft so make sure we acknowledge the distinct difference between  voluntary immigration, refugees, and SLAVES! Because it matters
@JoelHartranft my ancestors weren't even considered to be human beings when they got here. And endured well over 200 years of torture.
@JoelHartranft I don't doubt that... but when they got here they weren't slaves. They could share that dream of making this place home

There are plenty of battles and people that need support . It's time for people to make these companies fight with you!
Make sure you hold them accountable to their promises.
Your demands and ACTION have made two companies pledge $4,000,000 to the fight. @lyft ( $1m to ACLU) @uber ( $3m Legal defense fund)
businesses to get involved in the fight for justice, they MUST comply. Take @Uber and @lyft as an example.
I think the American people have accidentally stumbled across the power of their leverage... the $$. When you decide to put pressure on ...

The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights.
will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.
And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content ...
Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning.
This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment.
Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now.
Live on King! 🤴🏾#MLKDay ✊🏾
And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice." -MLK-
We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.
a check which has come back marked insufficient funds.
Instead of honoring this sacred obligation America has given the Negro people a bad check
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.
yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men...
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,
"In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. "

You clearly weren't born into poverty...people born into lower income households, 70% stay in low income households https://t.co/kGmG2A1Mt7
@RCrahal because this issue seems to be an issue that is especially (not specifically) effecting the black community. A spade is a spade.

@TheArrogantPrik honestly I've been struggling to answer you without sarcasm or shade. It's hard tho because you really have no clue.
@TheArrogantPrik I've never said anything bad or negative about anyone in my tweets. If I'm losing love for being proud to be black then 👌🏾
@pocketsjoe1 you are ignoring the climate and context of the entire matter. There would never be a need for Riley to do that.
The color of your fist doesn't bother me. Are you saying you're mad because u can't wear KKK outfits in peace? Lol https://t.co/BExdatPnik

@Bensmithten you gotta learn to take the good with the bad.
@caroledougherty I hate to see it like that as well. But I can't ignore the glaring problems. I know it's not the majority.
You CLEARLY have never listened to the lyrics lol  https://t.co/2y0r9atztl
@BrianQuattrone we can agree on that... She is definitely fine!
@MRomeo31 are you referring to the word NEGRO ?
I'm in desperate need for some good crawfish ... It's been too long https://t.co/0A9HbYV2LB
@BigWilson78 can you give her a pass?seeing as tho it is Black history month! Lol
@caroledougherty @Bensmithten the black panther party of self defense was started to stand up against police brutality.
@caroledougherty doesn't mean that we HATE cops and don't need them. We do need them. But I'm sure u understand the concern we have
@caroledougherty you do understand that due to past/present incidents the black community has lost a bit of confidence the justice system
@bink2585 @BigWilson78 black history month isn't the time to display black pride? Lol
@Jonfaulkner27 @LFFStadium my wife doesn't play those games... She got tickets 6 seconds after they were released 😂
@BrianQuattrone what do u mean?
@BigWilson78 @SouthJerzMick I wouldn't listen to Coldplay but it was good show in my opinion. It's ok to not like her music.
@flymattyfly did she say that she doesn't like the police?? I haven't read that anywhere nor did I hear it
@BigWilson78 so you are upset at the costume choice right? Not the empowering  message they delivered
@1st_Son_of_MD I really enjoy these conversations... I get tired of talking football all day! Real life is happening everyday
@obiold @flymattyfly but what does that have to do with the halftime show. There were 0 references to police in her show.
@NationOfEagles I have a lot of time but I'm on it!
@caroledougherty I'm not understanding your point ... Explain
A half time show that featured black pride, Gay Pride, and white pride would've been an awesome thing to witness  https://t.co/bSggQxpyJX
Lol she recovered smooth didn't she? Lol https://t.co/MDSSTWUEwI
@flymattyfly I'm almost positive that EVERY artist who performs at the SB halftime has a police escort. Lol
I would have to agree with you there https://t.co/aOLV1lf8iA
@BigWilson78 there were other people in charge who approved that show before she did it. U mad at them?
@RoseA80 that argument I can understand but then I would challenge your understanding of the black panther party and its origins
😂😂😂 Was she supposed to walk to the game? Lol https://t.co/GN3ZwhCDC2
@SouthJerzMick @VinnyHoliday hahaha have you ever listened to the lyrics? Or did u hear that from someone else ?
💯 https://t.co/PlcDomCYc2
@nola_hxc didnt know the black panther party was considered a terrorist hate group. If so then I see why you would be offended
@BigWilson78 how?
@Tveez_World I don't watch basketball lol my bad
@SprolesRcyce see the way my account is set up... 😂
I need ya'll to explain something to me.... Y is everyone so mad at Beyoncé? Is this real or is the media hyping it up?

@SprolesRcyce @Koala91_ huge?? No... But I am under contact.
@Koala91_  I used to be a Nike guy... Then someone asked "will u protect this house?!?" And I was compelled to say "yes"

Just got outta church... Turned on the game and said "Sweet Jesus!!!!" Didn't see this coming
I see you @LarryFitzgerald ! Good stuff!
But it really didn't flip 😂😂😂😂
@DeweysDawgs now when it comes to defenseless players I completely agree. But not with a runner.
@DeweysDawgs I just don't agree that it's dirty. Violent? Yes.Unnecessary? Depends who you ask. Dirty? No, not when it's inside the rules
I would never hit a WR in the head if the QB didn't throw him the ball! Lol don't throw into traffic !! #BlametheQB !
When WR's get destroyed by DB's I understand the penalty. But I think the league should fine the QB who threw it. He's the one to blame!
@VincentLyonsPhD I would agree... But it still was not against the rules.
@G_Snail28 I'm glad some body remembers that lol
@MattStehman he did 😉
@VincentLyonsPhD it was a legal hit!!!! Not every helmet to helmet hit is illegal... We all think that because the announcers say it lol
Oh well...
@Antimyth_tatted you are correct. That's the funny thing about the rule. If he hit him the same exact way in the other direction, no flag
@Bayology101 that's the thing... That defenseless rule doesn't pertain to the defense. So that player had no protection
The just literally gave him a penalty for hitting the guy too hard lol that player isn't defenseless
I really wish announcers would stop exaggerating the description of these hits... Emendola hit him with his shoulder

@BeattieJoseph sorry, but I'm not sorry lol can't make everyone happy
@BeattieJoseph everyone is human... I can take the good with the bad. George Washington owned slaves but I respect him as a former president
@BeattieJoseph he also said "I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against."
@BeattieJoseph in the context in which African American people were living in those days I can see why someone could feel that way.
@dreams_chaser26 @Harp41 nah young man you can't do that... You gotta earn that. It's not just a pose, it's our frat ΩΨΦ

@HeathEvans44 I'll see u next week!
@HeathEvans44 but I digressed. My issue was the "toughness" Check our run offense and run defense stats. That is the measure of toughness
@HeathEvans44 but who better to tell you about the stresses of playing on the Eagles D than me? Lol
@HeathEvans44 but like you said... I'd never say anything that would reflect bad on my team so my opinion is definitely bias.
@HeathEvans44 two years ago the Broncos had the best offense ever. They ran into Seattle  and everyone jumped ship. Every scheme has holes
@HeathEvans44 is the system unorthodox? Definitely! Is it flawed? Not any more than every other offense in the league.
@HeathEvans44 the only time this defense gets put in a bad situation is when we turn the ball over. But that's the same league wide
@HeathEvans44 I would argue that our 09 offense was the same. The difference was we took the ball away on D better than anyone in the NFL.
“@HeathEvans44: Nope...It's called toughness. Something your @Eagles team knows nothing about.” That's a bold statement ... Please elaborate

They spend the night in jail to sober up then head home in the morning. Back to life as it was. Not everyone is afforded that privilege
I've seen tons of people while in college get drunk, talk belligerent to the cops, and resist arrest and it never ended in death.
@1SaintNation so it's ok that he died?
Thank you to all the police officers who do their job the proper way. You don't get enough credit. Let's hold those who don't accountable
Simply trying to figure it out... At the end of the day no one wins... And a life was still lost! #ICantBreathe http://t.co/5DIJnJJp5h
But those stuck in the middle... Bold enough to speak out but level headed enough to listen to other perspectives are stuck in a war zone
We watch countless cases of tragedy! Most people sprint to either ends of the spectrum causing an exponential division nation wide
We are running out of excuse of why you can be justified to take someone's life over a misdemeanor offense or simply because you feel afraid
How many lives must be lost before America wakes up? It has a problem that is costing it's citizens their lives.
