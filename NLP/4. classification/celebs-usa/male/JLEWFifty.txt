A way, way, way too early theoretical lineup, if HanRam makes #Tribe 25-man roster (&amp; Frankie can play #OpeningDay )  1. Martin - CF 2. Lindor - SS 3. JRAM - 3B 4. Santana - 1B 5. Kipnis - 2B 6. Hanley - DH 7. Bauers - LF 8. Perez - C 9. Naquin/Luplow - RF
Hanley Ramirez, who turns 35 in September, was released by the Red Sox last season after only 44 games, hitting .254, 6 HR, 29 RBI.  The two years before 2018:  ‘17: .242, 23 HR, 62 RBI (133 G) ‘16: .286, 30 HR, 111 RBI (147 G) https://t.co/1gN3NpdTzQ

Couple early observations from the first few innings: https://t.co/Kh2kJs6Xfb
I’ve been thru 2 CBA negotiations &amp; understand the postering both sides are portraying right now. Swaying public perception is always a priority.  However, smart people on both sides of the aisle here WON’T allow a work stoppage. Compromises will be made. A deal WILL get done.
Interesting perspective from some current MLB players. Similar rhetoric from ownership side.  All may be mute when they watch the NFL &amp; NFLPA go to a work stoppage before them in ‘21  MLB players ready to 'burn the whole system down.' https://t.co/FV9lQgJq27

Reminder to all #Tribe fans saying the sky is falling because of the projected opening day offense: 2016’s opening day lineup against Boston, when @Indians went to World Series  1. Rajai 2. Kip 3.

The Manny Machado deal lays a floor of what Francisco Lindor can look to build on for possible free agency.  Assuming he comes through the calf injury healthy &amp; continues to be relatively injury free + as productive as he has: he stands to make north of Machado’s total contract

.@Indians fans: on the eve of Pitchers &amp; Catchers first official workout, which Bullpen pitcher are you predicting to surprise the most in spring training?
Many have asked about a possible strike, lockout, etc. for MLB as the current CBA expires in 2021.  As of today: best guess is there's about a 15-20% chance it happens.  The NFL?   60-70% chance a work stoppage does happen when their current agreement expires after 2020 season

A lot of “changing of the guard” takes after Clemson won national title for 2nd time in 3 years last night. As Lee Corso might say, “not so fast..”  Since 1998 (start of BCS), Nat’l Titles by conference:  SEC: 11* ACC: 5 PAC-10/12: 2* B1G: 2 Big-12: 2  LSU/USC tied at No.1 in ‘03
Clemson wins it’s 2nd Title in 3 years.  In 2019, for the upcoming football year, your season-openers for each of the finalists:  Alabama vs Duke (in Atlanta) Clemson vs Georgia Tech  See you in 8 short months, College Football!
In an 8-team playoff, Clemson would’ve played:  - No.7 Michigan  - and then the winner of No.3 Notre Dame/No.6 Ohio State...
@AnneMarieWTHR Probably between horrible and worse than horrible 😂🤦‍♂️
Are we going to see the Andrew Luck comparisons with Trevor Lawrence, as far as the most “polished”, “slam dunk” QB when he enters the draft?  True freshman. And I’m with Herbie - how much better does he look in 2 years?
Ballgame??!
Oh boy... not the fake Saban was looking for 😂
Thoughts on the National Title Game halftime show?
So..  Does Jalen Hurts have to rescue Tua this year?!?
Clemson is prepared as hell for this Bama defense, in big spots so far.  Wow we’ve got a good one on our hands tonight !
30 points.  In almost 16 minutes.  Yeah..
Getting reports that the Bachelor hasn’t even started yet..  ..and there’s already been 50+ minutes of on-air activities

Really?  Two schools that are on the complete opposite side of the country.. matching up for the 4th consecutive season in the postseason..  Yeah I think watching on TV is the most cost-effective option here, Darren. https://t.co/6pxlVWogHo
Sounds like @NickCaminoWTAM will have quite #TheRant topic to open our first #SportsFeed 2.0 show of 2019 tonight!  Join us on @wtam1100 from 6-7pm! https://t.co/mlMyFdqUv6

🙌🏻🙏🏻.. thrilled to be back and part of the best amateur baseball program in the state of Ohio! https://t.co/upUzZfpCLl
Been saying it all week on the #SportsFeed 2.0 on @wtam1100 :  #Browns &amp; Baker do the damn thing, defeat #RavensFlock 21-20  No AB? No problem - Ben, JuJu &amp; #HereWeGo nation thank their lucky stars, beat #WhoDey 24-14..   .. &amp; owe Cleveland a MASSIVE thank you
Kyler Murray is so fun to watch.  Gonna be great to see him in the Bay Area donning that @Athletics green very soon!
Hang on everybody!!! We got a GAME!
Wait...  No second half in this current game?  For real? https://t.co/TMgJFGuJct
That block though.. my ears are STILL ringing rewatching that!!
We’ve got a ballgame!!!
Stop the fight.  Now. https://t.co/CY7ddxpwZe
Somewhere, Georgia fans are losing their minds watching these 2 games tonight..
ACC refs 😂😂
My God.  Tua is good.  Bama is good.  ... it’s early
Wow.. huge break for Bama
Whoa... Sooners defense ACTUALLY made a stop!? And a turnover?! In the red zone!??? https://t.co/1RkvKaKYBI
If the playoff were 8 teams, here’s your bracket:  1) Bama v 8) UCF 4) Oklahoma v 5) Georgia  2) Clemson v 7) Michigan 3) Notre Dame v 6) Ohio State
If the playoff were 16 teams, here’s your bracket:  1) Bama v 16) West Virginia 8) UCF v 9) Washington 5) Georgia v 12) Penn St 4) Oklahoma v 13) Washington St  3) Notre Dame v 14) Kentucky 6) Ohio State v 11) LSU 7) Michigan v 10) Florida 2) Clemson v 15) Texas
I’ll even entertain a 6-team playoff:  No.1 Bama &amp; No.2 Clemson get byes  No.6 Ohio State @ No.3 Notre Dame in South Bend  No.5 Georgia @ No.4 Oklahoma in Norman  Lowest remaining seed plays Bama Highest remaining seed plays Clemson
Don’t even play the 4th quarter. Call the fight now. https://t.co/u3yyPXE9Ce
Dear CFP committee:  Even if they go undefeated in the future, please don’t put Notre Dame anywhere near the playoff again.  Thanks, Everyone
Still have the bottle I popped back in 2007, when we won the ALDS in old Yankee Stadium.. LOVE that you hang this on your tree each year now, Bets! https://t.co/ouUhsxRk5P

Another example of how this year’s critical moments are blown by no-calls from NFL refs
.@NickCaminoWTAM - current mood: https://t.co/76JZxb5mNF
.@indians - just happened to check this out - and honestly, won't surprise me if the GOAT can play both 2B &amp; 3B https://t.co/Alz9HEnVCy
So you basically get Carlos Santana for 2 years/$29M instead of paying Edwin $25M for one year, once the money swap is all said and done
Good amount of dough the #Indians are saving https://t.co/1yTFVoSTQJ
Trade details: https://t.co/uqGdzfhcJn
Bauers saw time in the OF for #Rays last year - guessing that’s the destination for him w/ #Indians  Santana/Alonso can mix between 1B &amp; DH just like Edwin/Alonso did.  Also possibility there’s another deal in the works if #Indians want Bauers/Santana to be their 1Bs
Sounding like Yandy Diaz to the #Rays and Jake Bauers coming back to #Indians via @MLBNetworkRadio
Talked about Edwin being traded making sense this morning.. seems like it’s going down now https://t.co/SjeWBiDVFS
A reminder to #Indians fan base:  I’m with you in NOT being satisfied to “just” win the AL Central. Neither is anyone in the organization.  How many offseason signings become busts too? Be careful to “overreact” to what teams do in FA.
More thoughts:  - #Indians FO past 3 years did well at trade deadline. Goal is to beat BOS, NYY, HOU, etc in playoffs. Taking stock of “needs” changes from offseason to July  - Anxious to see Salazar, Cody Anderson in camp; what can they provide that FA/trade market doesn’t?
Thoughts continued:  - 3-team trade possibility makes sense for a position player trade involving Edwin. Salary obligation, even for 1 year, is a lot to take on for a possibly smaller market acquiring club  - Don’t need to “win” the offseason either: the AL Central is still awful
Thoughts as #WinterMeetings wrap up:  - #Indians continue to increase leverage in trade conversations regarding Kluber, Bauer w/ more SPs coming off the board  - they’re NOT OBLIGATED to trade either of them THIS YEAR; if the RIGHT deal doesn’t present itself, they’re staying
Thank God. Cc: @NickCaminoWTAM https://t.co/9dkS6TBHcA

Patrick Corbin signing should open the floodgates shortly on Dallas Keuchel, Nathan Eovaldi, other top SPs available as FAs.  Those signings, as each happen, greatly increase #Indians leverage in any trade discussions involving potentially Kluber, Carrasco &amp;/or Bauer.
My God.  #Braves made their move..  #Mets made their move.. #Nationals come over the top with theirs.. https://t.co/rXr6XB5unb
The Urban news today isn’t a surprise to many of us who knew the apparent truth - still, it’s a bittersweet day - happy to see him coach his final B1G Title game this last Saturday in-person; even prouder to know he NEVER LOST TO TTUN.

.@NickCaminoWTAM things we agreed on during #SportsFeed 2.0 this week:  - Ohio State controls their own destiny - pressure is SQUARELY on TTUN - Urban can now coach more aggressively and/or “care-free” because OSU now in “spoiler” role - #Buckeyes may only be -1/-1.5
Never thought you’d hear this headline going into TTUN week:  “Buckeyes trying to play spoiler, keep CFB Playoff hopes alive.”  What. A. Game.
#Buckeyes in real trouble now..
Umm.. just turned on the #Buckeyes game.. WTF is going on?  @AnthonyRothman @MattyIce971 can you boys bring me up to speed?

In NO way are ANY of these moves happening right now, but hypothetically - if #Tribe deals 1 of Kluber/Cookie this winter, rotation next 2-3 years could look like this:  1. CK/CC 2. Bauer (FA in ‘21) 3. Clevinger 4. Bieber 5. FA/Cody Anderson/Plutko/McKenzie  *Salazar to pen? https://t.co/CFQk2ZctNP

What will the masses in Beantown say about David Price now?!  Got the news headline all ready for you:  Price. IS. Right!
It’s gonna be quite the 48 hours in Massachusetts.  #RedSox about to wrap up the #WorldSeries   #Patriots to take on the #Bills for MNF
Epic https://t.co/cCBv0lEmYH
Stop kicking XPs. Altogether.  Go for 2 from now on.  This is utterly ridiculous.
It’s not over... (but it is)  #RedSox are insanely good w/ RISP &amp; 2-outs in #Postseason   I shared a beverage w/ Alex Cora after Boston won the ‘07 ALCS cause I wanted to see how it looked to go to the #WorldSeries   He’s gonna bring #DoDamage another title tmrw or Tuesday
LeBron: 2-4  Dodgers: about to be down 3-1  At least the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are 5-5-1... 😂
Goodnight, LA
Hitting with RISP will get you a lot of 💰💰💰 in MLB.  It’s about to get the #RedSox a 3–1 #WorldSeries lead..
Masterful job by Joe Kelly forcing Grandal to come out of his approach and swing at a pitch that wasn't what Yasmani wanted.. to the 9th! Tied! https://t.co/Mn1tOyLdud
Puig is safe.
paging @DreKnott - you up? #WorldSeries
If David Price is forced to go more than 1 inning here, does he start again in this series?
Ryan Madson is HR machine. Kenley Jansen may be a close second. But credit that to Dave Roberts asking/forcing him to get 6+ outs AGAIN on back-to-back nights..
Steve. Pearce.
God I love that fiery clip of Chris Sale... guy had his damn cleats on to go play the field last night too. Baller.
HAHAHAH... Madson is a human HR machine! WOW!
Not the best I’ve seen in a game..  The Kerry Wood glove punt into the stands at Wrigley after Derek Lee hit a walkoff HR tops my list https://t.co/6M4Ak8q5Y6
Perfectly ok with the bat flip there... btw...  Don’t @ Me either
WOW 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻  We’ve got a Series now!!
Credit where it’s due, even after 7+ hours of baseball in Game 3:  Rodriguez and Hill are taking advantage of some tired hitters arms and minds right now - and saving their bullpens too. Scoreless thru 5.. and we may have extras on the horizon.. again

Good morning, @MonumentCircle .. fine, brisk morning to see you this Sunday! https://t.co/HGMfDvKrwu
The 3-run HR from Puig might ultimately be the dagger...  .. but Chris Taylor’s momentum-swinging catch to take away the game tying 2-out RBI 2B from Yelich, will certainly be the blow that put the Brewers on the ropes.
PUIG!
18 pitches in 2 scoreless innings for Hader.  Yes - conceivably - he could go 4 innings tonight w/ that efficiency thus far..
.@scottbraun &amp; I surmised when Josh Hader may enter tonight’s game during our #LoudOuts show on @MLBNetworkRadio today..  We have our answer: the 3rd inning
Holy no-doubter!  Ring the Bell-inger on that answer! Cody crushes a go-ahead 2-run HR to put LAD on top, 2-1!
The most valuable player in the NL just might have the most valuable hit of the entire series right there: a solo HR from Christian Yelich puts the #Brewers up 1-0, B1
#AnchorDown⚓️ fellas! Best of luck on this new season to my friend &amp; mentor Coach @TimCorbin 🙌🏻 https://t.co/F0GL6FlON3
@Mike_Ferrin called for a crooked number today on #PowerAlley when we gave our keys to the game.  And a crooked number he received!  Brew Crew leads it 5-1, T3
#RedSox win 4 straight and knock out the defending champs to reach the #WorldSeries.  #Astros record before the “cheating” allegations in the 2018 #postseason became public:  4-0  #Astros record AFTER the “cheating” allegations became public:  0-4  Ball don’t lie.
#Astros get on the board, but Eovaldi comes on to get the final out of the 7th.  #DoDamage now 6 outs from the #WorldSeries , leading 4-1
Wow.. epic note here, @Buster_ESPN   #AnchorDown ⚓️ https://t.co/jFkNqns7xW
Since the “cheating” allegations became public, the #Astros have now been outscored 29-11.
THE DEVERS DAGGER!!!  3-run HR and it’s BLOWN OPEN.  #DoDamage leads 4-0, T6
David Price is thru 5 shutout innings, with a 1-0 lead.. in a potential clinching game that can send the #RedSox to the #WorldSeries.  ALMOST EVERYTHING Sox fans held negatively against him in the past can be wiped away in this outing if he can continue this dominance..
A great lesson for young pitchers out there:  Watch how David Price is speeding up &amp; slowing down the #Astros hitters with a simple FB/CH combo.  When you pitch ahead in the count, locate your FB &amp; maintain FB armspeed on the changeup = good things happen!  3 zeroes for DP so far
YOU HANG IT, THEY BANG IT!  1-out 2-strike solo HR by #JustDingers JD Martinez!  #DoDamage⁠ ⁠ up 1-0, T3

The Baseball Gods know and see all... MLB may have “exonerated” the #Astros from any “wrongdoing” and considered “the matter closed” on sign stealing..  But oh boy - it just seems like the body shots keep coming &amp; the #RedSox offense continues to land critical blow after blow..
JBJ.
God the #RedSox have been clutch with 2-outs and RISP... incredible.  Tied again at 4!
A #postseason norm now: the inevitable George Springer homer
Are the #RedSox going to be accused of “stealing outs” now that the Mookie play went their way?  Karma #Astros ... karma..
I believe @TheTrivShow had the numbers.. but since the #Astros were accused of cheating/stealing signs/etc, they’ve been out scored by Boston, including tonight, 19-5..
Fabulous take.. https://t.co/AovKSNfuZP

.@Indians fans:  It didn’t end the way we all wanted it to, but on behalf of our entire production &amp; broadcast team @SportsTimeOhio - THANK YOU for another incredible season.  Signing off for 2018.. see you fantasy campers in Goodyear on 1/19/2019!  Until next time.. 🙏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👋🏻
FWIW: projected #Tribe rotation &amp; pen for next season, on active roster currently  1. Kluber 2. Carrasco 3. Bauer 4. Clevinger 5. Bieber  Closer: Hand Cimber Olson Otero Edwards N.Ramirez
A sad ending to the 2018 year.  We invite you to join us one final time for the last #IndiansLive postgame on @SportsTimeOhio
An offseason that won’t be short on action for the #Tribe too... a lot of moving parts &amp; a lot of new faces will be in Goodyear in 2019.
Players for this Cleveland Indians postseason roster that will become Free Agents after the season:  Brantley Davis Cabrera Donaldson Miller Allen
Dagger from Springer?  His TENTH career postseason HR extends the HOU lead to 5-2
2 errors in the inning didn’t help Trevor Bauer..  But all series - CLE P’s have had NO margin for error. NONE.  Little to no offense all series long and now a 4-2 hole in the 7th
If the #Tribe is going to get back in this series, their 3-4-5 hitters need a real awakening:  Ramirez: 0-for-10, BB, 4 K Encarnacion: 1-for-10, BB, 4 K Donaldson:0-for-10, BB, 4 K
GAS FACE!  Bauer blows away McCann and strands Reddick at first.  #Tribe takes a 2-1 lead into B6!
Bauer can single-handedly extend this postseason. And as long as he doesn’t try to over-throw and just pitch to his strengths in this relief appearance, he’ll accomplish that.
BG!!!!
How the hell do you say he didn’t offer at that!?
2-outs.. GAME. UNTIED!!!  FRANCISCO LINDOR WITH LOUD NOISES!!!
One mistake, but heck of an outing from Clevinger.. if indeed that’s his final pitch, he’s given the #Tribe a legit chance to win this game..  #Indians offense needs to have a breakout inning - it’s extremely overdue  1-1, headed to B5
FWIW - if you expected to win this game by scoring only one run - that’s ridiculous to even fathom against this HOU lineup.
The one spot you CAN’T. MISS.  Breaking ball up and out over the plate - and to Springer of all people.  9th postseason HR for George, but unfortunately, a 1-1 tie now in the 5th
Decision time coming for Terry Francona (again):  Let Clevinger get thru a sticky situation, if it presents itself, the way he’s been throwing today..  Or..  Go to the bullpen..  #Tribe leads 1-0, headed to T5
Shadows going to become a problem for both sides hitting in the next inning and on.. #Tribe needs to extend the lead as much as possible right now..
Shutdown inning: Complete  More importantly: an efficient pitch count inning  Clevinger at 75 pitches thru 4.  Cleveland leads 1-0
CRAZY to think about - considering how all these series have gone so far.. https://t.co/KY9W5zXFtc
Thru 3 innings: as good as you could hope for from Clevinger.  Thru 3 innings: #Tribe has 3 hits - they had 6 total hits coming into Game 3  1-0 good guys as we head to T4
Perfect guy you want up in that position - and Brantley barely missed a 2B off the wall.  Sac fly and the @Indians strike first. They lead 1-0, B3
#RallyTogether
Hang in there bud! https://t.co/KsAOG87GOR
How’s everybody’s heart rate!?  Somehow, some way.. the leadoff BB doesn’t come back to bite.. and Clevinger gets back-to-back BIG TIME OUTS to escape the bases-loaded jam!  Still scoreless as we head to B3!
Can tell the adjustments already against this HOU lineup.. mixing in the Curve to add to the Slider .. there wasn’t a lot of that variation in the first two games..  Plays havoc on a hitter’s timing - it’s benefitted Clevinger immensely so far.  2-out BB to Correa, but no damage.
Crucial 1st inning - Clevinger passes his 1st test  2-out 2B from Bregman, but no damage done.  #Tribe bats coming up!
Archie and AL have their game face on.. 🤣 https://t.co/JwRmMEJM2i

Umm... yeah... #ufc229 basically had the best fight AFTER the main event!!! WOW... ABSOLUTE CHAOS!
A frustrating loss.. and a lot to talk about as the #Indians head home facing elimination on Monday afternoon, down 2 games to None.  We try to make sense of this one on #IndiansLive Postgame on @SportsTimeOhio
9 outs to try and tie this thing..
Miller doesn’t record an out. Gives up the go-ahead runs.  He’s got the hook and Bauer is in.  And the horrible part about all of this - Carrasco, ultimately, is on the hook for the loss.  ..and he did nothing wrong. 🤦‍♂️
Just don’t understand how you take Carrasco out when he was pitching the way he was..
Wow. Tito is taking Carrasco out here with under 80 pitches.   The theme is #TrustInTito .. let’s see if he’s got another big time move - and let’s see what Andrew Miller has in crunch time..
Regardless of what happens for the #Indians offense in the top of the 6th.. the bottom half will define Carrasco’s start.. he’ll have Altuve-Bregman-Gurriel, and no doubt that Tito will have Andrew Miller ready at the start of the inning..
Impressive, efficient inning from Carrasco. And much needed momentum keeper for the #Tribe  .@Indians maintain their 1-0 lead thru 4.  As Arch just said: “TIME TO ADD ON!”
HOLY CRAP!!!  DONALDSON TO JRAM ... AND WHAT A TURN AS HE WAS FALLING OVER SECOND BASE FOR THE INNING ENDING GIDP!!!
LIFTOFF LINDOR!!!!!  2-out 2-strike solo HR gives the @Indians their first lead, 1-0, T3!
GOLD. GLOVE. PLAY!  Donaldson with an INCREDIBLE defensive stop to take away a sure double for Gurriel!
Edwin ends the no-no bid in the 2nd.. a leadoff 1B.  First time in the last 14 IP that Gerrit Cole has allowed a leadoff hit
Excellent 1st inning from Carrasco - exactly what you wanted.. now time for the lineup to make Cole work a bit..
Ok... so it’s not the Chipotle I had for lunch that’s making me sweat... https://t.co/5BI11bb9nU
.@Indians fans - we’ll see you on @SportsTimeOhio very soon!! #RallyTogether #OurTownOurTeams https://t.co/4UZrkucx5W
After the final out of Game 1 - we encourage you to change over to @SportsTimeOhio for #IndiansLive postgame.  We expect to hear from Terry Francona and Corey Kluber about today’s game - and we’ll look ahead to Carrasco v Cole in a must-win Game 2 for the #Tribe
Will be interesting to hear Corey Kluber’s thoughts on his outing.. where it came undone.. and the unnerving trend of allowing the long ball at an alarming rate the last 4 postseason starts.  To the 9th, #Tribe trailing 7-2
It’s a rout in Houston. And now the question will be when does Tito take Trevor Bauer out..?
Only thing I can reason as to why Bauer is in: it’s been 4 days since he’s been in a game and should Tito need him tmrw for multiple innings, he won’t be on extended rest (he’s pitching today on a normal “turn” in the rotation)
Bauer? Now? Down 3 in the 7th?
4 solo HR’s from the #Astros .. and all of them: NO DOUBTERS
Big shutdown inning from Cimber &amp; Allen.  @BringerOfRain20 to lead things off in the 7th..
Boy... credit to Mike Sarbaugh, #Tribe 3rd base coach, who positions the infield.  Perfect spot to put Alonso on that line drive out.  Cimber does his job. Now it’s time for Cody Allen w/ 2 down in B6
.@Indians are alive!  Time for a shutdown inning from the #Tribe pen..
Deficit cut in half.. JRAM’s RBI GO trims HOU’s lead to 4-2
UH OH... Elvis... err... Ryan Pressly uncorks a wild pitch and the #Tribe is on the board!
Brantley was seeing Verlander SO WELL in that AB.. he didn’t want to walk.. he wanted TO HIT!  Decision time for Hinch as Indians have loaded the bases... and he gives JV the hook..  Suddenly, as @AlPawlowski said - if #Tribe scores, JV outing doesn’t look that good
Wow. Kipnis just got hosed on that 3-2 strike out..  That’s an absolute ball. And it has been all day. For both sides
There will be no, no-hitter today against the #Indians ..  Yan Gomes leads off the 6th with a sharp 1B to right..
Showers for Kluber. Tito heads to the pen for Adam Cimber.  #Tribe trails 4-0 in the 5th
The facts are what they are, and they’re not pretty:   Coming into today, the last 3 postseason GS for Kluber:  10.1 IP, 6 HR allowed .. 13 ER allowed on 16 hits  Today: 3 HR allowed in 4+ IP
Justin Verlander has a no-hitter through 5 innings.  HOU leads 2-0
Critical inning for the #Tribe offense. A hit.. any hit.. will take some pressure off of them.
Gotta stop the bleeding here.. 1 run was going to be tough.. 2 could be insurmountable..
Arguably the quickest hands in the AL: Bregman draws first blood, but a horrible mistake middle-in from CK  HOU leads 1-0
Monster inning for CK: 3-4-5 of the order..
Gotta cut down trying to swing for the fences IMO.. playing right into Verlander’s hand if you’re trying to do that..
Wow. Kluber misses with a pitch out over the plate to Altuve, and he, like JV, got away with one.  Quick. Efficient. AND WE LIKE THAT!  Scoreless thru 3!
2nd time thru for CK.. let’s see how pitching in early will help him expand away, especially to the RHs with the cutter and breaking ball
Concerted effort from JV to elevate FBs .. idea is to expand the K zone north &amp; south to create more effectiveness on both the heater and breaking ball.  5 K’s thru 3 for the #Astros ace
2nd time thru the order for JV now.. lets see if he sticks with heaters or mixes in more offspeed..
Even though it ended in a K - fabulous AB from Gomes. Really made JV work for that out
Disagree w/ Eck about Kluber being erratic: Kluber trying to establish the inner-half. Thus the 2 HBPs. You want him to have that part of the plate 2nd and (hopefully) 3rd time around the order.  And on-cue : beautiful inning-ending GIDP to Frankie.  Scoreless through 2!
Certainly. Will be interesting how JV/CK adjust 2nd time around the order https://t.co/b2hxgQBYlI
Verlander got away with a mistake to Melky there..
Early reveal of strategy from Verlander &amp; Kluber:  Both JRAM &amp; Bregman will be guys that won’t see a lot of good pitches to hit today, as long as JV &amp; CK are in the game.  Good 1st inning for Kluber (14 pitches) and we’re scoreless thru 1!
I’ll be live tweeting throughout the game - and also giving you some of Rick’s thoughts as well!  Rick: Beware of Tyler White in the #Astros lineup - good hitter &amp; can do damage from the bottom half

My God.  1st postseason game for Giancarlo Stanton and he punctuates a fabulous night for the Yankees with a MOONSHOT solo HR.  7-2 NYY, B8
Updated:  K.Davis: 2-run HR  A.Judge: 2-for-3, 2-run HR L.Voit: 2-RBI 3B https://t.co/ZvIEsCzvhJ
When does Aroldis Chapman enter this game...?  Khris Davis with an oppo KRUSH job.. 6-2 NYY, T8
Red Sox projected Gm1-3 SPs v NYY in 2018:  Sale: 2-0, 0.69 ERA; 19 K in 13 IP  Price: 0-3, 10.34 ERA; 11 K, 9 BB in 15.2 IP  Porcello: 2-0, 2.31 ERA; 20 K in 23.1 IP
Happ v Boston this year: 1.99 ERA in 4 GS; .200 AAG, 29 K in 22.2 IP  ..however  2 GS in Fenway: 1-1, 3.72 ERA (4 of 9 runs allowed were earned); .231 AAG, 13 K in 9.2 IP
Aaron Boone’s plan is playing out perfectly:  - win w/ your No.3 option (Severino) in the WC game  - line up your Red Sox killer (Happ) for Gm1 of ALDS, Tanaka/Sabathia for Gm2  - Tanaka/Sabathia/Severino pitches Gm3 in NY
Welp... not bad so far on my NYY predictions:  Judge &amp; Voit accounting for all 4 of the 6 RBI tonight.  6-0 NYY, B6 https://t.co/ZvIEsCzvhJ
Blake Treinen is in. @AlPawlowski favorite reliever in the game (that’s not a CLE RP) will inherit his team’s season in the balance, coming on in relief of Rodney, down 3-0, B6
A’s on the ropes..
2-0 lead in the 5th 2 on.. Nobody out.. 2-3-4 coming up in the order..  STONES ABs from BETANCES. Wow was that impressive!  The A’s are turned away in the 5th.. #Yankees a chance to extend the lead now in the bottom half!
Lou Trivino!! INCREDIBLE three innings of work to keep the A’s right in this game!  Big inning for Severino now.. Boone will surely be going AB by AB, with Betances &amp; Co. probably ready at the start of the inning..
Triple digits on the TBS gun... monster K to escape! https://t.co/PwrAWZM9VQ
I’m with Eckersley’s opinion - haven’t seen Severino throw this amount of sliders &amp;/or offspeed, in total, in one outing all year.. anything on that @TylerKepner ?  My only feeling is there’s something in the recent scouting reports that says the A’s have struggled w/ them..
Boy .. Andujar two awful throws so far tonight. Does his 1-out error cost the Yankees here after a BB from Severino..?
A’s have weathered the initial storm.. now can the middle of their lineup put something together this second time thru against Severino?  I’d stick with the gas if I was him.. don’t speed up their bats with too much offspeed stuff.
This broadcast trio on @TBSNetwork of Brian Anderson, Eck and Darling is really informative &amp; entertaining. Great chemistry too 🙌🏻👏🏻
Good nugget to keep in mind.. https://t.co/rIGT0YlxMw
All rise: 2-0 Yanks on an absolute missile HR from Judge
What a difference a year makes:  Severino recorded 1 out and didn’t escape the 1st inning in the WC game last year.  A flourish of FBs gives him and the Yankees a 1-2-3 first frame.
Good morning. Good afternoon. Goodnight.  96. 97. 99 from Severino to start the game
Hitters to watch tonight that I think can impact the game in a big way:  OAK: N.Martini K.Davis M.Chapman  NYY: A.Judge L.Voit
.@Indians fans:  As you settle in for the AL #WildCard game tonight, an IMPORTANT REMINDER!!!!  ❗️#IndiansLive pregame ONE HOUR before 1st pitch EVERY POSTSEASON GAME on @SportsTimeOhio   ❗️IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FINAL OUT.. #IndiansLive ONE HOUR postgame  DO.  NOT.  MISS IT! https://t.co/WixRaIlXQv
With the season he’s had, you’d assume Michael Brantley gets a QO from the #Indians after the season..  Less likely: Cody Allen, Andrew Miller, Lonnie Chisenhall https://t.co/DQNwqOHoya
.@mlb #Postseason continues w/ the AL Wild Card game! Who you got tonight?!  I like #PinstripePride to edge #WinForHeroTown 6-2
Completely fine with this result!! https://t.co/RMjcpXO4Iv
What a game. Rockies move on with a 2-1 defeat of the Cubs in 13 innings!
Former Indians farmhand Tony Wolters with the hit of his life... go-ahead RBI 1B with 2 strikes and 2 outs..  Rockies now lead 2-1, T13
The Rockies get what they want:  Heart of their order against soft-tossing Kyle Hendricks.  Here. We. Go!
That 10am tee time is starting to creep up on me tho.. https://t.co/gCtiAz4eTL
Live look at Milwaukee watching this game: https://t.co/C8vSUdphzV
Have we seen a little bit of everything in this game or what... a bear hug to.. eh hem.. prevent a throw for a double play?!
Heartbeat anybody?!? Bryant with a mental mistake to load the bases, but Hamels bails him out!! To the bottom of 11!
Arenado. Period.
Hamels handled that like it was his final inning of spring training before the regular season opening day start..  Another chance for the Cubs to end it in B10!
Great nugget, Jayson! https://t.co/6KmtDtYhhr
Bonus baseball on Day 1 of the #Postseason - wouldn’t have it any other way!
What an AB from Contreras
Does big Willy Contreras send the Cubbies to Milwaukee with one swing here..?!
In the worst place possible: an elimination game in the #postseason https://t.co/gelWQA9Fif
Who’s having fun?!?  WHAT a start to the #Postseason !!
Hindsight being 20/20: walk Baez there and take your chances with an out at any base with Almora at the plate?
JAVY! Tied!
😂😂😂😂😂  That’s all I got on that replay review
Stones AB from Ottavino... wicked 97 heater and movement late... Rockies escape! On to the 8th, still 1-0 Colorado
WOW. Monster error from Butera
That’ll do it for Freeland. What a gem for the young lefty. Everything you could ask for and more.  Ottavino in for the Rockies, leading 1-0 w/ 2 down B7
Holy moly. Game saving diving catch from Story!
Almora reaches as the tying run! And now what does Bud Black do?
Not an official call... but Javy Baez due for an absolute blast to tie this thing up..?
Young HS &amp; college players watching this game:  You MUST MUST MUST remember game situation &amp; the OF’s arm strength + accuracy.  That could be the momentum swing the Cubs needed..
Ian Desmond... the HELL are you doing?!?
Now Bud Black in an interesting situation:  Freeland due up 4th. Leading 1-0.  Rockies bullpen was horrendous all year, so insurance runs at a premium
Man oh man. A gift with the Dahl blunder in right is short lived as Rizzo grounds into the inning ending double play.  Rockies hanging on for dear life, leading 1-0 after 6!
Joe Maddon’s gamble pays off.. Happ, pinch hitting for Lester, reaches as the tying run..
Headed to B5, COL leads 1-0..  6-7-8 due up... w/ Lester cruising  If first 3 men reach.... what does Joe Maddon do with the pitcher’s spot due up 4th!!?
Just feels like the next team to score in this game wins it.. momentum at this point will be such a blow to the opposition, particularly because both SPs are locked in
The “Dahl Ball” gets held in the ballpark by the ghosts of Wrigley Field (or Harry Carey as my man @AnthonyRothman texted me).  Lester had his bad inning, got it out of the way and is in command of that breaking ball now.  Cubs lineup needs to make Freeland sweat a bit..
Zobrist is safe
Will be interesting to see how Freeland does under the following pressure:  1) no postseason experience 2) never started on 3 days rest 3) winner take all.. on the Road

I’d love to see it collectively bargained: team w/ better record hosts all 3 G (if 3rd is necessary) so reg. season integrity is kept at a high level.  Start both the AL/NL 3-game series Monday after reg. season is completed Sunday - then ALL LDS series can begin Friday that week https://t.co/NXA10oKbzC
A few things starting to shift as we hit the dog days of August:  - AL East &amp; Central are decided - Houston has big problems - the Yankees may not be hosting the Wild Card game, if they make the playoffs https://t.co/IoYSXKaDoe

4-game series for #Yankees/#RedSox - and the way New York is set up w/ a lackluster rotation, Boston can basically eliminate NYY from AL East contention w/ a series win this weekend in Beantown..
I give #RedSox Manager Alex Cora a ton of credit - he’s brought speed pressure on the base paths to Boston &amp; it’s playing absolute havoc on the AL, as much as the #Yankees right now..
Baseball 101 for #Yankees P Johnathan Holder - don’t ever force the runner HOME with your first throw in a rundown.. give the ball up to the catcher 🤦‍♂️
#Yankees going to their bullpen.. in the 4th inning.. against #RedSox .. it’s been over an hour &amp; a half into the game ...  ...oh, you didn’t think these games would go quickly, did you? Pace of play.. 😂😂😂

@MLBastian  https://t.co/iDHBvhGaIT
We often quarrel &amp; disagree - but this analysis is spot on from Bastian as to why the Martin move needed to be made, at minimum https://t.co/uuF3hm3LJs
Cutch still a possibility for #Tribe - and into August - if he’s not dealt before 4pm ET today https://t.co/N3H5oOe6Qp
Haven’t received a paycheck from the #Indians since 2011.. thanks! https://t.co/NYhyX5Tc07
Back in the time machine a moment to 2016:  Coco Crisp, acquired in August that year, had the following big hits after joining #Indians  - ALDS GM3: 2-R HR to clinch ALDS  - ALCS GM5: solo HR to clinch ALCS  - WS GM3: game-winning RBI 1B, CLE won 1-0, led series 2-1 https://t.co/S1pcVlz8QH
One more thing #Indians fans:  Most impactful trade of 2017 came AFTER the #TradeDeadline - Houston acquired Justin Verlander.. on August 31st https://t.co/1nrrybq1x6
A word of caution to #Indians fans:  Just because a “major” trade doesn’t happen before 4pm, doesn’t mean a MAJOR move isn’t on the horizon. BIG names will be on waivers (Harper, McCutchen, Donaldson, etc) in a week or so.. big deal can still go down in August
Possible postseason opponents rotation breakdown:  BOS: 3 RHP, 2 LHP NYY: 4 RHP, 1 LHP HOU: 4 RHP, 1 LHP SEA: 3 RHP, 2 LHP OAK: 4 RHP, 1 LHP  Martin hitting .275 v RHP/.176 v LHP
.@AlPawlowski and I will discuss more in-depth on #TwitterLive at 3:30p - you can follow @SportsTimeOhio &amp; watch us online - but remember: #Tribe needed everyday CF and Martin with fantastic speed will probably hit 9th.. great 2nd leadoff option in front of Lindor/Brantley/JRAM
Leonys Martin is controlled through 2019. #Tribe will have him for the rest of 2018 and his final year of arb eligibility will be ‘19.

Wow.. https://t.co/4xu2TcFwgV
Defensive issues - not adding another bat - are the glaring weakness for this ball club. Some plays aren’t routine, but there are a few in the last few nights that ARE, that cost this team dramatically in the opposing run column. It can’t continue.

As I sit &amp; watch #Cardinals/#Cubs tonight, another name surfaces to me that might be available (although probably a long shot) for the #Tribe :   #Cardinals slugger Jose Martinez  - right handed power bat - can play OF and 1B - controllable thru 2023 (arb eligible in 2020)

Bingo - there’s your 2 pen arms https://t.co/bklvhSD1LG
As @AlPawlowski &amp; I have been talking about on #IndiansLive for a few weeks:  - Hand provided the dominant late inning arm to augment Miller/Allen  - Hand under team control thru 2020 (3 yrs/$19.75M), team option for 2021 .. protects #Tribe if Miller/Allen walk in FA https://t.co/Cy12VsU8QU
Boom!!! https://t.co/JsNgFvHUZY
FWIW - looking at what #Dodgers had to part w/ for 2 months of Machado - #Tribe did the right thing by not giving up their prized possessions for him. I’d anticipate they continue seeking a controllable closer &amp; veteran OF bat as we near deadline. Expect the dominoes to fall fast

An Andy Dalton turnover leads to another Cleveland field goal.  Francisco Lindor makes it 17-0 w/ his 25th HR, a 3-run no-doubter.  It’s the 4th inning. https://t.co/VLEPtlM0Zo
Quick question, tweeps:  Can anyone find the last time the #Browns held a 14-0 lead on the #Bengals ?  #Indians currently a 14-0 lead over the #Reds here in the 4th as Riggleman goes back to the bullpen.. https://t.co/fE3eYWJAcV

Goldy, Votto - 2 of the best 1B in the game.  Scooter &amp; Suarez! Well done from our @Reds 2B &amp; 3B brethren.. Cain, Yelich getting it done as well!  Ozzie Albies - Best 21-yr-old 2B you’re just now hearing about!  Blackmon, Story, Posey, Realmuto all crazy good too!
Scherzer deserves to start for NL in his own backyard.  deGrom, Lester, Nola all having huge years.  Hader is the Andrew Miller of the NL  Kenley rebounded nicely from a horrible start.   Corbin, Folty &amp; Mikolas round out the very deserving starters.
If it were me filling out the lineup card for the AL:  Trout Betts Altuve Martinez JRAM Machado Abreu Judge Ramos
.@Indians @MrLapara wins the start at 3B for the AL All Stars!!  Wilson Ramos &amp; Jose Abreu both might get dealt, but an incredible first halves for both!  Machado, Altuve no-doubters.. can’t wait to see where AJ Hinch hits them in this lineup!
Best ever AL OF #AllStarGame lineup?  Betts Trout Judge  Wow.
I hope Arenado does the HR Derby.. 🙏🏻
Javy Baez &amp; Willson Contreras gonna be in a LOT of ASGs for years to come.. really exciting players to watch.  Freddie Freeman is my halfway-point pick for NL MVP right now too..

.@Indians fans: below are a few relievers the #Tribe could be a fit for come trade time - who do you favor most to be dealt to Cleveland?
My ideal scenario: - @Indians can keep both Mejia and McKenzie - they reach a deal for Texas closer Keone Kela (FA in 2022). May have to give up a Plutko or Bieber to get him, but you have your RP for ‘18 playoffs + safeguard for closer to 2022 if you lose Allen &amp;/or Miller to FA
FWIW - I agree w/ many of your responses: hate to give up Mejia AND McKenzie in a deal for Machado.. that being said, could you part w/ one or the other in a proposed deal and be ok with that?
Because it’s fun to look at - possible @Indians lineup construction w/ Machado:  Lindor - SS Brantley - LF Ramirez - 2B Machado - 3B Edwin - DH Alonso - 1B Gomes - C RF/CF RF/CF
.@Indians fans: in a possible trade scenario w/ @Orioles - would you give up Shane Bieber, Francisco Mejia &amp; Triston McKenzie for Manny Machado and reliever Brad Brach?
I mean.. @BauerOutage is right. Plain and simple. https://t.co/mdYMdIOd8k

Pretty outstanding effort in the last couple innings from Bieber. IMO - he’s earned himself another start, in Carrasco’s absence.  Oliver Perez summoned to face Mauer after Bieber worked 2 K’s with 2nd &amp; 3rd, nobody out. #Tribe still leads 4-1, T6

WEB GEM!! Wow!!!
Ridiculous this game is going to extras.. umpiring cost #Vandy a trip to CWS in regulation.. now they’ve gotta go extras.. incredible how such a bad call can possibly cost a team a chance at Omaha..
BALL. DONT. LIE!!!
Not sure who’s worse: NBA Finals refs or the Nashville Super Regionals umpires
Umpires to blame - 100%
When you watch the play back in real time, it’s absolutely the wrong call. You just hope it doesn’t cost Vandy the game..
3rd base umpire is 100% incorrect on the call
One of the worst calls I’ve seen in college baseball..

I’ll say it again - it feels rigged. How many easy calls can these refs miss and look the other way? So brutal to watch.. taking the game out of the players hands and swaying it to an obvious side
Refereeing in this Game 7 is some of the worst I’ve seen... since last night.

Lindor equally at fault as Bauer - who had 3 walks in the inning, all of them scored. Played with fire that inning &amp; paid dearly for it.
2 games, 3 costly errors from Francisco Lindor. It leads to 2 more runs as the #Yankees take a 3-1 lead in the 5th

Gary Sanchez swung. That’s a ridiculous bad missed call.
Kidding me right now?  Wow.  Tied.  On a wild pitch. https://t.co/tdRz5BIRxl
The Lindor error ended up changing that inning dramatically. What might have been just a run or none given up, turned into 4.  Tomlin deserves a huge amount of credit for keeping his cool &amp; getting 7 innings deep. https://t.co/NrDRSuDqox
Until this inning, you couldn’t blame Josh Tomlin for no offense.   His incredible outing (considering the opponent &amp; the stadium) - and the offense coming to life with a 5-Run 8th - gets us back to even at 5 apiece. https://t.co/C6rIqQht9h

Andrew Miller playing catch in the OF with Zach McAllister. From my eyes - looks comfortable, fluid, free &amp; easy. Would be eligible to be activated Saturday in NY.
Not really breaking news, but if pitchers need “tack” or some grip improvements, there’s been a healthy practice of using substances to improve command. Still haven’t seen such a SIGNIFICANT advantage with guys who use it over guys who don’t.. https://t.co/yOINnJXy4D

As I’ve told many people - one of the greatest feats in our sport is playing in your home country’s jersey.. let alone hitting a home run in the place you grew up, loving &amp; respecting the game. Francisco is a #NationalTreasure .. now, and forever.. 🇵🇷 https://t.co/0h1fRs3pE3
Big thank you to all of you #Tribe fans for your generous comments &amp; support - @AlPawlowski &amp; I will be back with you on Friday night at 6:30p for #IndiansLive on @SportsTimeOhio ! https://t.co/8UIYuTabh5
#GoneYonder  6-1 #Tribe https://t.co/ZmZUppMYm1
Ohhhhhhh YES!!!! It’s my favorite stat time:  .@Indians are 64-0 in the last 64 starts when they give Kluber 4+ runs of support  #Tribe leads 4-0, T6 https://t.co/7BSxLQIbv6
Hey.  We’ve hit 3 homers now.  It’s warm where the @Indians are playing.  And Kluber is throwing a shutout.  That is all. https://t.co/AEUiLyULnI
COULDNT. SCRIPT IT. BETTER!  .@Lindor12BC hits a 2-out 2-Run HR!!!!!  #Tribe leads 2-0! https://t.co/LNTMiAOjHw
So great listening to Robbie &amp; Sandy Alomar Jr talk about their experiences growing up, playing together, and coming home - incredible insight and both so humble. Speaks to their character and leadership, not only on the field, but role models for the players onfield presently.
Man.. can definitely tell the #Twins hitters haven’t seen live pitching in 3-4 days. Guess it’s also compounded by the fact that Kluber is on the mound.  Not mad at that.. considering these are divisional games against Tribe’s biggest threat. https://t.co/oEyRGDqthn
It’s going to be a World Baseball Classic-feel Tonight in Puerto Rico.. what a site and atmosphere to behold. I’ll be sharing my thoughts throughout the broadcast tonight @Indians fans!  Let’s #RollTribe and #RallyTogether !!

3 weeks to go for #Tribe to get right. Still some good things to take from tonight; more to improve on as well. Catch you guys next time! https://t.co/vagWHQY3am
Yikes. That Schwarber HR had a vapor trail on it. Goody serves up a leadoff big boy and it’s now 9-5 Cubs, T6
Uncomfortable outing for ZMac. Out of whack mechanically &amp; control suffering from it. But somehow, no damage done. #Tribe still trailing 8-5, headed to B5
Edwin going for it all on those swings, but #Tribe strands first two men to reach. Cubs still lead 8-5 after 4
And Bauer gives it all back. You thought Gomes crushed his grand slam? Almora JR just hit one to Mars. 3-run HR and Cubs back in front 8-5. That’s all for the Bauer Outage
Pretty standard baseball phrasing that’s been around for 100+ years.. poetry nonetheless! https://t.co/O9gfsJQQXQ
GOMER GRAND SLAM!! My goodness - you hang it, he banged it!! All tied at 5! https://t.co/2oZXzxdrPw
5 runs allowed on 7 hits from Bauer. All began with 4-pitch leadoff walk, more missed locations. #Tribe trails 5-1, B3
Welp, Bauer not fooling any of these Cubs hitters. Carl Willis out to talk. Bases loaded, 1 out, #Tribe trails 4-1, T3
I’ll refer you to the Kipnis quote in one of @hoynsie latest articles. https://t.co/dC1aNYBdV7
4-pitch leadoff Walk comes around on the Kipnis throwing error. Cubs extend lead to 3-1, T3
GONE YONDER!! Solo BLAST to dead CF and it cuts the Cubs lead to 2-1! https://t.co/SWPbl4fo0y
Fantastic PFP by Bauer to get the double play started - young pitchers out there.. watch his footwork and throwing accuracy! Made all the difference in turning 2!
Strong to quite strong chance.. 😉.. stay tuned to #IndiansLive ! https://t.co/Uf0YgJsWKu
Location, location. A big miss &amp; a big shot from Navarro into the desert night off Bauer. 2-0 Cubs
Just something satisfying for #Tribe fans seeing Kyle Schwarber strike out..  Not to be outdone: @Lindor12BC w/ yet another GOLD GLOVE PLAY! WOW! https://t.co/rp2ocH2hWE
.@Indians fans: if you’re tuning into @MLBNetwork like I am tonight to watch #Tribe/@Cubs - shoot me some Q’s &amp; I’ll get you some A’s..   Oh..  .. #BabyHulk is watching too https://t.co/zqhpiF7W3g

.@Indians fans: joining my guys @andy_baskin &amp; Jeff Phelps on @923TheFan NOW to talk #Tribe ! https://t.co/XLDJAJfAhB
This idea is fascinating to me - basically “teams” of pen guys if you want:  8-9 P’s: Closer 3 relievers designated for games on M-W-F-Su 3 relievers designated for games on T-Th-Sa 1-2 relievers “floating” based on above usage  P’s “know” when they’re pitching - helps prep too https://t.co/AMBvcip6JR
HS &amp; college guys:  "If you ever hear me say the words, 'launch angle' or anything like that, I'm lying right to your face," said Kipnis. "That's not anything I've ever worked on or cared about. I work on hitting the ball hard where it's pitched and staying balanced and on time. https://t.co/ZAa2Abhjj6

Bingo. Fundamentally undermines a pitcher’s effectiveness just in that example alone. https://t.co/OoildQSddF
If you want to limit mound visits from catchers, pitching coaches, managers - that’s reasonable. But don’t undermine fundamental principles of the game for 5 minutes of perceived game length
Commish Manfred needs to be reminded that messing with a hitter’s timing is strategy of the game. You take away my ability to keep him guessing about my pace of pitching the ball (or, time to the plate), you’ve fundamentally put a competitive disadvantage on the pitcher.
Friendly reminder to those that think a pitch clock will solve “pace of play issues” - if I’m not ready to throw a pitch/not confident in the pitch called, I’m stepping off and re-grouping. You can’t penalize me for that as a pitcher, period.
Best of luck beginning the Road to Omaha guys!! https://t.co/24gbLwmzWN

Saw him during my time at Fantasy Camp - he’s in great spirits &amp; looks strong as ever. Patience will be key, but really like his frame of mind &amp; presence approaching this season. He’ll be a darkhorse to help this team at some point in 2018.. https://t.co/j0UC1PT2uU
No so radical of a thought if you think their options thru - interested to see how #Tribe fans might think the following could work:  1. Kluber 2. Cookie 3. Bauer 4. Tomlin 5. Clevinger 6. Salazar/Merritt https://t.co/SsfOgTzaKz
One of the great baseball men in the industry &amp; an even better GM to work with. A worthy honor for a wonderful person! Thanks for all you’ve done &amp; congrats Ken! https://t.co/j6jWOAstww

What was that?!??? Omg
What a finish this will be..!!!!
Start greasing the poles in Philly...
Holy crap.
As we all expected: this game comes down to a final drive with Tom Brady getting the ball
Does it survive the ground...?!??
If you’re a #Browns wide receiver watching tonight - these Eagles wideouts are showing you how to catch the football. What a clinic
Doug Pederson just dialing it up perfectly all game. Another gutsy fourth down call and conversion..
Oh man - @amazon takes the cake for best #superbowl commercial 😂😂
Brady and Gronk. Unstoppable
Can confirm: No. Both offenses have sacked both defenses https://t.co/KaGkAWpuHu
OBJ and Eli dancing is just classic 😂😂😂
Difference in the game right now? Missed XPs. Missed FG. Failed 2-PT conversion.
This game is a slugfest. So fun to watch right now. And Tom Brady at 40 is just magical.. #SuperBowl
Wow! It stands?? I’m with Collinsworth - I give up too on what’s a catch and what’s not
This guy Nick Foles.. I’m tellin ya. The moment isn’t too big. What a drive, but did Clement hang on?
My God did Brady &amp; Gronk make that drive look easy?? #SuperBowl
Man can Brady throw.. 400+ yds not out of the question before the night is done
Did someone just tell JT “hey man we need to cut this short.. this isn’t really working..”  That show lacked a lot of entertainment. Period.
Entertainment value:  Olympic curling &gt;&gt;&gt; this halftime show
I fell asleep already during this Halftime show... 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Does Justin Timberlake wanna try to follow this first half? Tough job.. what a game so far!
Umm.. who’s got 2/2 for #superbowl squares out there at Half?!?
What. A. Call!!!
@AlyssaRaymond - #Thor is calling us for SYDNEY!!!
I mean.. these missed XPs/FGs are driving people in the southern tip of Nevada crazy!
What a drive. We got a ballgame! #superbowl

#BleepDontStink !!! Winner @Febreze_Fresh !!
Somewhere, somebody is happy that 2-PT conversion failed! #SuperBowlSquares
Does this game feel a LOT like last year’s?? #SuperBowlLll
Seriously Coke? That’s the best you could put out there?
That’s why Tom throws for a living..
Avocados from Mexico - early winner for #SuperBowl best ad
Omg. That hit.
YES! New #MissionImpossible !!!
Missed field goal prop too! Wow!
What’s the starting salary for these people who are tasked with making the #superbowl commercials? Just stealing money - hopefully they improve as the game goes on
@Wendys !!! Finally a good commercial! And throwing shade at @McDonalds 😂😂
Missed extra point prop hit for anybody?!? Wow!
Nick Foles. Alshon Jeffery. Not afraid. #SuperBowl
Commercials are atrocious thus far.. #SuperBowl

It’ll never happen. Period. Players know there’s WAYYY too much to lose if they go down that path. Besides, when did turning down $25M/year become a thing? Don’t be that guy and/or agent that thinks you’ve got it all figured out. You don’t. https://t.co/rhElmYDKei

Last spikes I ever recorded professional outs in - let’s hope they’ve got some magic left in… https://t.co/LlzOuimRIc
Something to consider w/ potential weak AL Central in ‘18: - win 45-50 of 76 divisional G’s + - go .550 win % in rest of 86 G (47-39) = 92-97 wins - really good chance to retain No.1 seed for playoffs - AL East winner plays AL West winner in LDS = I’ll take my chances in 7-G LCS https://t.co/r14Azm4RLa
Lot of moving parts in that situation. Urshela &amp; Diaz will get long looks this spring in different roles IMO. Depth is always a priority out of camp. https://t.co/msFQ9UPk9v
From what I hear, a potential move from any club to get Yelich would cost MONSTER prospects. Stay tuned! https://t.co/UiJdY7AffG
Depends - take a look at the potential 2019 FA list &amp; I’d rather wait for them! https://t.co/1lpwtp1D16
.@Indians fans: w/ #TribeFest less than 24 hours away, shoot me some Questions &amp; I’ll answer as many as I can! Also - stay tuned all next week as I’ll bring you some of the sights &amp; sounds of #FantasyCamp in Goodyear! https://t.co/rc8qr6skWW
A lot of Fortune 500 companies put a heavy amount of their capital in the Under each year for the #Browns - about as sure an investment there is these days.. https://t.co/R2TeF2ZMOY
Bob Mayer was instrumental in the @Indians drafting me (both in 2002 &amp; 2005); so thankful for his efforts &amp; all scouts - these guys are HUGE reasons why the #Tribe is a perennial contender! Congrats to Bob, Bo &amp; Don! https://t.co/V7BBvCeOnZ

Case Keenum, take a bow pal..   @AnthonyRothman - you’re alive!! Congrats!
...and the Vikings cover 😂😂😂
HOLY MIRACLE!!!!
As @NickCaminoWTAM would say: That FG probably more OVERly meaningful on MANY fronts right now..
Brees! Clutch!
Forbath drilled it! With plenty to spare!  Up to the defense now..
Adam Thielen!!!!!
Ok CaseKeenum - go less a game-winning TD drive!
Alvin Kamara. Man oh man.
Wow! Special teams gives the #Saints a huuuuge momentum swing!
Big day tomorrow!  Join Me as I’m in on @TheTrivShow 3-6p - we’ll talk about @GlennForbes1 big wkend, check in with @NickCaminoWTAM at The Q for #Warriors #Cavs , &amp; discuss how far the #Browns really are from playoff contention. You won’t want to miss it on @wtam1100 ! https://t.co/82y6jntNiG
Troy Aikman talking about Pat Shurmur being “stress free because he spent 2 years in CLE. Doesn’t get more stressful than that..” 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Man do the #Saints look overmatched or what!
#SuperBowl will be played in Minneapolis this year. Can confirm #SKOL would be visitors, but would have home-field advantage https://t.co/hE6veHJzTW
Ok @AnthonyRothman - riding with you today! #SKOL
What a game. And Tom Brady will go back to the #SuperBowl
Welp, Steelers will get a chance to get the ball back, in a one possession game..
Goodness. What’s the line in New England next week against Bortles and the boys?!
Does this game ultimately go the losing way for Pittsburgh because of turnovers + Todd Haley play calling on the 4th downs?
This game comes down to the end of regulation with a 4th down TD pass from Ben right? Just has to now..
You’ve gotta be kidding me.. AGAIN! On 4th down ... Antonio Brown!!!
This comeback would be an all-timer for Ben. Gonna be an exciting finish..
In the biggest of moments, you can always count on Joe Haden getting burned. Now it happens in the playoffs too 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
What is Todd Haley thinking on 4th and short again?!?
And there’s your turning point. Monster blocked punt. Huge mistake from JAX
Huge defensive stand by Pittsburgh. Coulda been picked. Either way - big Mo back with the Black &amp; Yellow
TJ Yeldon just laid the Wood!
It’s a ballgame!! Another INCREDIBLE GRAB from the Steelers. LeVeon Bell!
Hold everything!!!!! Monster 4th down conversion for a TD from Ben!!!
Backbreaker
Uh oh. Fournette didn’t look good on that...
Even with a 14-point lead, just feels like JAX needs points here to get momentum back..
God. Antonio Brown is in a whole different class. UNBELIEVABLE catch!
Whoa there.. lot of game left Willsy! https://t.co/Co1L8kcGoL
Totally don’t understand that playcall from PIT on 4th and 1.. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Jacksonville not intimidated whatsoever. Steelers got their hands full
My God. What a play by Myles Jack.
Wow. Old Bortles almost showed up there..
.@Indians fantasy campers: a week from today, I’ll see you here..!! https://t.co/ssAh6h9C9q
Going to be really good #ChampionshipSunday next week.
Everybody with the Under is loving it.. https://t.co/17tijL7M4L
Did the clock operator have Patriots -14 too? Sheesh
Horrible play call there - I’m with Romo - what were they thinking?!
Finally - a penalty called on the Patriots
What a catch!!!! #titanup
Somewhere, Kyle Shanahan is laughing hysterically at this ATLANTA offense.  Meanwhile, Nick Foles on the doorstep of the #SuperBowl
What a finish. Philly is gonna be insane next Sunday..
My God. Matty Ice. And Julio. Wow

.@Indians FO showed they’d do what it takes at Trade Deadline last 2 yrs. if TOR, BAL are out of race, what’s not to stop them from renting 2 months of Donaldson or Machado? Just talking out loud.. 🤷‍♂️
.@Indians fans: something to marinate on - #Tribe will play in (on paper) weakest AL division. Sets up well for their chances to get No.1 seed again. That means if NYY &amp; HOU won their divisions, one is eliminated before #Tribe would have to play winner in potential LCS.. 🤷‍♂️
@AlyssaRaymond &amp; I will be booking these tickets down the line for #NYE one year! Thanks @united !! https://t.co/4Bf2WhzWz5

Enjoying rebuttaling fan tweets today, this time on ownership “letting guys walk”, “not spending money”, etc:  As of now, #Tribe has 11th highest payroll in MLB (~$112M). That increases once arb deals finish.  Top 5 as 1/12:  LAD, $166M SF, $161M BOS, $156M LAA, $151M WAS, $149M https://t.co/wPKmVmwx2p

.@Indians fans: For all of you commenting today that the current roster is “weak” or “average”, interesting to take a look back at the Opening Day lineups of the past few seasons...  Yeah, I don’t think the 2018 version will be “weak” or “average”.. https://t.co/v45PLsUpyy
It’s so bad for the Cavs right now that Ty Lue is gonna be out of timeouts... it’s the first half

Harper Machado Blackmon Kershaw Donaldson Puig N.Cruz Pollock McCutchen Dozier Keuchel G.Richards Pomeranz A.Miller Allen Kimbrel Brach Z.Britton Herrera https://t.co/rxTFAxXAjp
Those asking about Bruce:  -wanted to return to Mets &amp; per @jcrasnick “guys are getting antsy”  -$39M is way less than what he’s worth  - #Tribe payroll increases from current roster guaranteed contracts + arb eligible players = severely decreased funds to go after big FAs https://t.co/A2qqrpfPlL
.@Indians potential pitching staff, as of today:  1. Kluber 2. Carrasco 3. Bauer 4. Clevinger 5. Salazar/Tomlin  Allen Miller Otero Goody Olsen ZMac Merritt  Thoughts?
.@Indians potential lineup, as of today:  1. Kipnis - 2B 2. Lindor - SS 3. Ramirez - 3B 4. Edwin - DH 5. Brantley - LF 6. Alonso - 1B 7. Chisenhall - RF 8. Gomes - C 9. Zimmer - CF  Bench: Perez, Guyer, Urshella, ?  Thoughts?
As an old 33-yr old who’s played with both Kip &amp; Brant - I like our chances.  ..aren’t you retired, Greg? Dean? Or whatever? #GetOffTheLawn https://t.co/VN501mXSLO

#Apollo13 now on @netflix - still get goosebumps hearing the opening theme. One of the best Ron Howard films of all-time!
As @NickCaminoWTAM &amp; I talked about on @wtam1100 concerning Nick’s convo w/ @BNightengale - how many teams would LOVE to trade spots with current #Tribe roster? I’d say at least 85% of the league w/o question.
Looking forward to getting to AZ to see @TheJK_Kid , Brantley, others back from injury. They’ll be major reasons why #Tribe gets back to playoffs &amp; whether or not they make a deep run. If they’re healthy, you’ve made 2 “major” acquisitions this offseason without going to FAs
As of January 10th, 2018 - I’m completely fine with #Tribe offseason to date. Apparently, the oddsmakers at the southern tip of Nevada are too, for their possible postseason run:  To win WS (via @BovadaLV ) NYY +500 HOU +600 LAD +600 CLE +750
A look at possible AL Central rotations to date:  CLE: Kluber, Carrasco, Bauer, Clevinger, Salazar/Tomlin MIN: E.Santana, Berrios, Gibson, Mejia, ? KC: Duffy, Kennedy, Hammel, Karns, Junis CWS: Rodon, Shields, Giolito, C.Fulmer, ? DET: M.Fulmer, Zimmerman, Fiers, Boyd, Norris
No question adding Cole helps #Astros in a more competitive AL West. Being the Hunted is completely different coming into a season than being the Hunters. HOU gets front-row 💺 in that dept. https://t.co/ETAYK9FszC
Proud to have worked with you as a player and now as a media member. You’re one of a kind bud! Godspeed &amp; good luck! 🙌🏻🥂 https://t.co/TACR2tjkqM
.@astros not messing around to defend the title, eh @blummer27 !? https://t.co/UbEVK9KBHh

Somewhere, Sashi Brown is trying to trade back to get picks to select Jake Fromm..
Btw - EVERY athlete should rewatch what Jalen Hurts did after that TD, going out to congratulate Tua... THAT’S being a TRUE TEAMMATE!
🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/4gDs9Kf0vM
More Hawaiian QBs!!! #Bama
Welp, we’ve seen this movie before.. would expect Saban’s adjustments to help jumpstart Bama in the 2nd half..
.@Indians #FantasyCamp members: my feelings knowing we are ONLY 12 DAYS AWAY from getting started in Goodyear!! Can’t WAIT for my FIRST YEAR with you all! https://t.co/okqWij3xAh

If you see one movie this weekend - see #MollysGame - @AlyssaRaymond &amp; I LOVED IT!! Incredibly well done by Aaron Sorkin &amp; even better that it’s based on a true story!
No #Nashvegas trip is complete w/o a visit to @PancakePantry ! @AlyssaRaymond is now officially… https://t.co/ITOfHc7hwI
Ironic: @AlyssaRaymond &amp; I are in Nashville as we speak. The entertainment was amazing last night! https://t.co/DNWfMsCXGE
Healthy Bama looks overpowering against Clemson..
It’s a hard and fast “No” on Baker Mayfield if I’m the #Browns
GEORGIA!!
Holy crap. Blocked again!!!
OT! #RoseBowl2018
Fabulous ending setting up for this #RoseBowl - wow!
Quite the start to #CFBPlayoff - Bama &amp; Clemson will have a lot of drama to live up to!
What a game. #cfbplayoff committee certainly got these two teams right.. #RoseBowl
Wow. UCF woulda been destroyed by either Georgia or Oklahoma in the #CFBplayoffs if the committee put them in..
Is she perfect or what?! No better way than starting 2018 with my @AlyssaRaymond in #Nashvegas… https://t.co/OuSh2SWMB9
#NeverForget #UltimateEmbarrassment #browns
Joe Haden burned deep... yep I’ve seen that movie before 😂

Goodnight and safe travels, Sam Darnold. See you in Cleveland very soon young man!
Credit where it’s due: Urban Meyer coached his tail off. JT did what he needed to. And the PAC12 choked as usual.
Urban Meyer now 11-3 career record in Bowl games
Congrats @OhioStateFB !! #CottonBowl Champs! https://t.co/YQpXgOc71Q
As a 33-year-old, having come up at the same time as LBJ, I’m intrigued as to how he handles this part of his career.. https://t.co/y3RtGRsYSe
Somewhere, Sashi Brown smiles - knowing he will get home at 5pm, Monday thru Friday
Those of you who took Ohio State -10 are slightly anxious...
As we said before: GOODNIGHT @pac12 !! #Buckeyes https://t.co/JXnUTZ76KJ
Congrats JT on passing @drewbrees !!
Goodnight, @pac12
3 turnovers...? 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/YlKPLcCNcM
Hey Kizer: don’t get a year-long lease.. #Darnold
“@NickCaminoWTAM &amp; @DreKnott walk into a room...” https://t.co/ausu0eK01N
Campbell!
Final work day of 2017 tomorrow! Who should interview who?
Hang on bud! Scoreboard! https://t.co/wHNUi4PZnZ
I’m ok with #Tribe making a drastic move for Machado for one year... https://t.co/4ohK0ngjc4
There’s a reason why the @pac12 is horrendous. Besides #Darnold - you’re seeing why
Get the radar guns out - you’re toast if you come without shoulder, knee, shin &amp; more body pads! https://t.co/W0Mv5XuW9Z
Should be interesting. Leverage + being basically an entire mountain higher on release point + who knows = battle for rotation spot https://t.co/qpSThnB2Ui
Wait... aren’t you a @pac12 fan?! Stop! https://t.co/dBiD51xynu
#Winning https://t.co/ILqyIqqkTf

Hey, Kizer - pack your stuff. #Darnold
Can’t wait to hit you #OEB fungoes! Cc: @OEBMcNerney https://t.co/C3jCEfNzNv
Insight from Brock Huard on #Darnold right now is fantastic. Mentality + adjustments + athleticism and competitiveness / awareness. Really outstanding.
I’ll deal with you soon! #BewareTheIdesOfJanuary https://t.co/ZucMrZv3WO
