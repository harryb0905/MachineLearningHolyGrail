Hard work and risk are the gatekeepers for your dreams. You have to go through them or you’ll never get where you want to be.  So embrace the struggle and push on!
To everyone who didn’t win an Oscar I’d just like to say... HI!! Hope you have a great week!
You’re welcome. I view it as a community service :) https://t.co/BP8QFvB2z1
Some thoughts on the Oscars (for context I haven’t watched any of it)   1. Can’t believe that movie didn’t win  2. That dress was gorgeous and a bit shocking 3. Really hoping she finally wins one after all the nominations she’s gotten previously
Another year another Oscars snub... I really thought some of my Instagram videos deserved more attention... #oscars
Is there a way to let google and all the other creepy internet peoples know that I’ve already bought the thing they keep spamming me about....they should ask amazon before they place the ad....
My two year old daughter just told me that I could be a handsome prince when I grow up... so I have that to look forward to 😏👍
Dear @twitter, like most decent people, I don’t think that Malia Obama’s life is any of my business. While I understand that some stupid people on both sides are trying to turn her life into another reason to spew ignorant hate, personally I’d rather we just left her alone.
I think the word I should have used is not “satisfied” with myself. Happy doesn’t actually capture it accurately. I’m not mad at who I am, I just also see the places I want to and need to work on. So I refuse to accept that my failings are permanent. https://t.co/0iGQIUKgTG
Ya I can understand that perspective. For me I’m not searching for something bigger I’m just working to get closer to the man I know God wants me to be. Less searching for answers and more just trying to live out the answers I already have. https://t.co/yx47bkyi9N
This is the view that I always want to have. I want to be aware of how I can be a better husband, father, man and I never want to be totally satisfied with who I am because that’s when you stop growing. https://t.co/ErtoqCQIXr
I’m not happy with who I am right now. But I’m happy with the direction I’m going.
I seriously LOVE @USAA @USAA_help  Someone stole my credit card number and tried to buy a bunch of stuff in Wisconsin. USAA sent me a text asking if it was me. I said nope. A 10 minute phone call later and everything is cool and they are sending out new cards 😁
Bro it’s the internet... just pretend to be rich!! https://t.co/J2f3x72oxt
You’ll be missed up until the moment you’re not.  You’ll be remembered right till the second you’re forgot.  Your life lasts just as long as it hasn’t stopped.  So worry about now not the time after you’ve dropped.
Acknowledge your faults but BELIEVE in your strengths. Choose to see yourself through the lens of what makes you unique. If you view yourself as the talented, powerful, valuable person you are, soon the world will too.

Well once again I didn’t win a #Grammy  On an unrelated note I haven’t released any music in several years.... I should really get on that.... #GRAMMYs
@ImMattGiraud No?

So I’ve been binge watching Friends on Netflix.  Couple thoughts 1. Still a hilarious show 2. I think I’m kinda Joe and Chandler mixed together 3. Phoebe is the best!  4. The fat jokes about Monica are pretty uncomfortable....
You are not stagnant. You are either moving toward or away from the person you want to be.
Change the way you speak to yourself and it will change the way you live. Be honest with yourself but always believe you are capable of greatness!
Believe that you are valuable, talented, unique, and worth the love of God.   Because it’s true.
Thanks for crushing her dreams.... haha https://t.co/ThJoR8kjkC
So my two year old just came up with a new word for when something is interesting and scary at the same time.   Incresicating (in-kres-sikating)  How do I make this an official word?? Haha @Dictionarycom @urbandictionary

Good morning y’all! Today is a great day to move on from past failures and work towards future successes!
Most people’s lives will be defined by how they approach failure. You either run and hide from it, or you learn and grow.
Ya I want to make that happen but I’ve just been spending all my time on the local tv show I’m co-hosting and producing. https://t.co/F6Mzg0Z9Su
Hey @BenRogers when you wanna come on my tv show??  https://t.co/Q07mWPQzso
Struck me this evening that I wake up every day with the assumption that I probably won’t die that day. There are people on this earth that can’t say that... be grateful.
So Carmen Sandiego on Netflix is kinda my favorite thing right now.... and not because my kids like it (which they do now)... I kinda forced them to watch it... 😁 @netflix @CarmenSandiego
With cats it’s less of a “give and take” and more of a “give and it still doesn’t care whether you live or die” kind of a relationship....
@BenRogers Well hey now that the season is over you can come be on my tv show! A little distraction to help with the depression..
The biggest obstacle between what you are and what you could be is your willingness to work.
Isn’t a “right triangle” just a left triangle viewed from the back?
Ok that’s it... I’m done with the terrible dad jokes for tonight... I will simply bid you all adieu. Or even better a full on rain shower!! 😁😀😬🤭😔🤷🏼‍♂️
I wonder how many people know that “doing something for posterity’s sake” doesn’t mean a butt workout...
I’ve had a massive spike in creativity and genius ever since I decided to just simple never turn the light switch in my head off....
I love when people use the term “the Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree!” As if apples had some other option and just as a group decided to forgo their flying ability to provide us with an effective alternative to saying “he acts like his dad”....
When all is said and done all you’re really left with is:
If someone tells me they are a “dog person” is it fair for me to assume they will play fetch with me??
In the long run the most important thing is almost always stamina....   *thread*

A little instacover for the new year. Starving has been stuck in my head for days. Hopefully this clears it out haha. #cover #music #starving https://t.co/S72Lej6b96
In 2019 I will be, more loving, more passionate, more creative, more caring, more organized, more powerful. I will view 2019 through the lens of my strengths and not my weaknesses. I will grow and be more than I am today.   At least that’s the plan 😏🤷🏼‍♂️👍😜
These are my goals for 2019. What are your goals? How are you planning on making next year better than this one?   #newyear #2019 #newyearsresolution #fitnessgoals #2019goals https://t.co/NVcPl7Yw62

Still a fan of course and I’m not going anywhere. But I don’t know how much of my time and emotions I can keep giving to a team that seems to refuse to admit it’s going the wrong direction.   See you next Sunday....maybe....if I don’t have something better to do...
I know that championships are hard to come by and I don’t expect to win it all every year. I just want to know that we’re moving in the right direction. That we aren’t being left behind by a league that is innovating while we try to relive the glory days.
It seems the quarterback made up for a multitude of sins. Poor play calling and an outdated plan for “America’s Team” have us somewhere in the 90s again but without the championships.
But as we get further and further away from one of this generations most underrated quarterbacks retiring, my perspective has changed.
When you said we just needed to get the “right personnel” in I believed you. I wanted the process to turn out right. And hey it even looked good for a while with Tony Romos magic behind center. I really did think we had something special.
When you told me that we just need to switch up the play callers but that the vision and plan for the team are correct I believed you. Because really what choice did I have. You’re my team and I want everything to work out.
When you said Jason Garrett was the genius we needed I believed you.  Maybe I shouldnt have but I dove in head first expecting something special. I even like the guy. He seems nice.
Dear @dallascowboys as a fan of the team I want your “plan” to work. I want everything you do to be successful. But it’s time to be honest for a minute. I’m losing my ability to continue with this relationship. (Thread)
Hey @BenRogers you think the cowboys are trying to get Dak killed back there on purpose or just “sticking with the plan”? Haha

I think one of the biggest differences with millennials and the generations before us is that we seem to WANT the world to see our mess. We want them to see how screwed up we are.
Biggest issue I see with this is that you could never trust Romo to be healthy even if they did go on a run. Much harder for Dak to step in mid season or in a playoff game because Romo finally broke again. I love Romo but he needed to retire and golf. https://t.co/xyayhdVldp

Today marks the birth of a great nation. As with all things it didn’t start perfectly. But the foundations were made so that this nation could grow and change. And the basic principles of personal value and  freedom (though not fully realized at the time) are worth celebrating.
What you’ve done, where you’ve been, successes and failures, only EDUCATE who you are today. They DONT decide who you are going to be. YOU decide who you are going to be. Don’t take that responsibility lightly or that privilege for granted.
One of the things I know for sure is that definitive statements never end well....
I was going in the right direction I just took the wrong exit.

My parents accepted Christ at a Billy Graham crusade. That's the reason I was introduced to the love of God from my first moment on this earth. It's also the reason I came to know Christ at an early age. Billy Graham was a great example of following God unapologetically.
“He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.” Micah 6:8

261 - A Nice Evening: https://t.co/XdCkvHeExV via @YouTube
To everyone out there experiencing some winter time blues. Im here for it with you. This time of year always has me fighting off my inner demons for some reason.
Your political beliefs (whether I agree with them or not) are not an excuse for me to treat you as less than what you are, a person made in the image of God. Your life is worth dying for and that truth supersedes any differences we may have.
Find someone that you constantly feel blessed to be with. Not someone you think you deserve. Because if we’re honest we don’t deserve much but sometimes God blesses us with someone amazing anyway. I married my greatest blessing.
The word is that I just watched the rookie again last night and while you weren’t the main character I was quite glad that you were in it. https://t.co/u8slv0mGdm
The worst thing to be is not right or wrong. It’s undecided. Because wrong can be made right. But never committing leaves you without hope of ever finding truth.
260 - I’m sick...: https://t.co/287sAbXOn3 via @YouTube

The way to a woman’s heart is through her HEART. There are no shortcuts or easy ways out. You have to treasure who she is as a person and respect that how she FEELS is just as important as the circumstances.
So I truly hate to be the bearer of bad news but unfortunately I cannot fill the shoes of the man you think me to be. There is another Tim Urban that you have mistaken me for. He is a deep thinking musically talented man and I am....one of those things... :) https://t.co/B71ITPfQgN

Ok good. Didn’t want to see you locked up over your love of quality literature. Can I ask what books you ended up not stealing?? https://t.co/T6Bo5qZBNz
Hey y’all!! One of my students wrote this amazing song and I want y’all to check it out!! https://t.co/w2kNvDOndR
Of course you are quite right and I apologize if I came across as disrespectful in my tweet. I totally agree that too many films these days are just a poor knock off of someone else’s success. I think the money risk is what hurts originality. https://t.co/3u87UFNkRC
I love the sunsets here! https://t.co/3jzK8mOQqC
Haha while the sass is commendable I’d once again say that I never defended anything. But if your follow is so easily lost and your opinion so fragile as to avoid even the idea of disagreement (even if purely imagined) I will say farewell and I wish you the best! https://t.co/gcj0NwQPMT
So then I should condemn every statement made by any president that condemned or reprimanded any hostile nation. That’s a long list of comments by virtually every president. Also I didn’t defend anything. Please read the tweets before accusing me of something. https://t.co/nDAbCrPWxq
Last good president or last good role model who was also president? Because they aren’t exactly the same thing. https://t.co/Qd9WL7qvDp
Did realize I brought my faith into anything or that I defended anyone. But your response did confirm that you are in fact nothing more than a political troll and for that I have no patience or interest. Have a wonderful evening. https://t.co/FqlvgqBu3M

Well Logan Paul definitely raised awareness. He raised awareness for just how far a person can go from reality, from decency, from humanity and still get millions of views on YouTube. No that trade off is not worth it...ever #loganpaul
Wanted to tweet something about how awful the Logan Paul video of the man who had committed suicide was.... but how do you even find words to describe that kind of ignorance and heartless behavior.... I hope no one is looking to him as a role model for anything...

Things I’ve learned today.  1. There are a lot of shady guys out there praying no one shines a light on them.  2. Bullying is terrible. But it’s always a good idea to wait until you have a better picture of the situation before jumping in.  3. Terrorists suck..

Day 225 - Totally Different Style Of Vlog!!: https://t.co/d4P4dvJCAA via @YouTube
@arnoldcam I think the response will be "you weren't bullied, you were the bully who got what he had coming" at least that is some of what I'm already seeing online.
@arnoldcam Oh I think exposer to the world outside of the one he grew up in would do worlds of good for him. I just also doubt that the people who offered those trips will want to follow through on them now.
@Canadian_Omar Unfortunately I haven’t watched this year at all but I’m always a fan of artists who do it all themselves.
@arnoldcam It’s not good man...
@quin0611 @ghosthunter718 Ya it’s super sad. Could’ve been such a great story of people coming together to help a kid.
So today seems like the perfect definition of "Monday"  Keaton.....that isn't going to end well. Akayed Ullah......cue the politics. Mario Batali.......doesn't even deny it.  Yup I'm ready for tuesday.
It's hard to know how much a 10 year old really believes and how much is just copying what he see's. Unfortunately he and his entire family are going to get attacked with a lot of hateful stuff which will probably push him closer to his family and their beliefs. https://t.co/FEYZijEwZr
Yes it is https://t.co/TbX7LksmCO
Nope but people are going to feel a lot less sympathy towards him now. I feel bad for him because he is just a kid. https://t.co/uKfn6e0SNH
It’s so messed up.... so many people good intentioned people just became a lot more jaded. https://t.co/vvFfa8Hl96
Yes https://t.co/IaCYfFb9jQ
Well I officially feel bad for everyone who commented on the Keaton situation. So many just trying to send positive messages and are now having to walk back an anti bullying message. What a messed up world...
@Canadian_Omar Just go look at the trending topic with the same name. It’s a pretty interesting story
So I’m wondering how many of the things that got offered to Keaton have been taken off the table now. Whatever is up with his family (and I truly have no idea) this kid is in the middle of quite the merry go round.
Happy Monday! https://t.co/zg20eR7Nl5

Mood today. #tired #dallas https://t.co/W8m9N7UMf1
And now it’s cold... #coldfront #fall #winter #dallas #texas https://t.co/4ZdtT7OwYT
I guess I’m done for now. If you’ve read all the way to here please know that I love you. It doesn’t matter if we agree on everything or nothing. I’m broken, but love can still come from broken things.
I know I’m guilty of this all too often. But if I want my daughters to live in a better world than what we have now, I have to change. I have to be the one to put my weapons down. To see the faults in others and still reach out in hopes that they will do the same.
but refuse to see that the specks in the eyes of the rest of the world are why we need each other. Not why we should push each other away.
So I guess what I’m getting at is this. I’m scared that we are pushing ourselves further apart every day. We are digging in deeper and deeper and yelling louder and louder that someone else is to blame. We carry around massive planks in our own eyes....
Maybe that is what we need to rally around. We preach acceptance but deny admittance to our “club” unless you have cast aside whatever faults we decide you have. But one of the biggest things we all have in common is the fact that we aren’t perfect. Lord knows I’m not.
Don’t get me wrong there are endless things to be mad about. We will always be able to find faults in others. Just as others have no problem finding faults in us. But that’s THE POINT. We are broken and faulty people. To believe otherwise is to walk with your eyes shut.
Afraid of what would actually happen if we were vulnerable with each other. If we put down our weapons and met eye to eye. So many would lose so much of their current identity if they didn’t have someone to despise. We say we want love but we bond around anger.
It’s like we are dead set on repeating all the worst parts of history, over and over again. We seem dead set on hating each other. No matter what barriers are broken down we seem to build up others to hide behind and throw stones. Subconsciously it feels like we are afraid.
Which gets me to the start of this thought. Where exactly are we going as a species right now? I think about this a lot. Especially when I look at my two beautiful daughters. I’m filled with excitement and terror for what the world will look like when they grow up.
Can’t sleep. So I guess it’s time to just start typing and see what happens. I guess this is a thread. I don’t really know where it’s going and in fairness it might not end up anywhere. But some say the joy is in the journey...I’ve always hated that saying (thread)

Every time I see a new guys name pop up on trending topics I assume another guy has been revealed as a horrible person... how sad is that?
Ya that is really sad. I wish it wasn’t the case https://t.co/Ny3NJAfndH
I agree but it’s also hard to prove any of it unless texts or messages were exchanged. So you have to just decide who to believe. It’s super unfortunate but that’s the case. https://t.co/EppDvcjP2A
Day 214 - I’m Sorry: https://t.co/CoV04imjoL via @YouTube
Unfortunately it is now a very valuable political weapon. Which is probably why many people are leery of believing anyone who accuses politicians around election time. I don’t see that getting better. https://t.co/a8ZL47yOvT
Ya it does feel a bit like a feeding frenzy and just the accusation is enough to ruin a career. But it’s also really hard to prove most of it so it comes down to a he said she said a lot of times. https://t.co/1rNWfZRHY6
Ya I will be curious to see if any of these allegations that have ruined careers turn out to be completely false. I hope not because it would lead people to doubt future accusers but it's always a possibility. https://t.co/udGSWSTGXI
It is easier but I will definitely start going back to the other way because I don’t want it to be poor quality video. Sorry about that https://t.co/465MCHibXU

Consider yourself one of the lucky ones... imagine the pressure on the rest of us. https://t.co/hMqEG9BfGD
Well I do feel as though I’m failing as a human if my tweets and responses happen to be shorter than the previously allotted number of characters. If this feeling gets to strong you may find me curled in a ball in the corner... https://t.co/nmbSKNC8zK

Day 89 - TRANS BAN DAY 2: https://t.co/aNmPgnX29c via @YouTube
@Canadian_Omar @bobcrowell @YouTube Ya I don't know. But I do know that the military has been paying for the gender reassignment stuff. So maybe that.
A Jack in the Box truck just drove by me and on the side it says. "Forget diamonds, salads are a girls best friend"......
@bobcrowell Haha oh don't worry I'm not angry. If it turns out that it was against his military advisors THEN I would be angry haha
@bobcrowell But that title alone tells me there isn't a news story there. It's an opinion piece. Which I avoid like the plague haha.
@bobcrowell At this point it's all conjecture as to who said what since no one is on record from the military saying whether they support or not.
@bobcrowell @YouTube But if it turns out that the military leaders advised against it or don't support it then I would have a problem with it.
@bobcrowell @YouTube I'm sure there was lobbying for it. But again from what I've heard he got the advice from military leaders as well.
That's one side of it but I've also heard from other places that it was also based on recommendations from generals. https://t.co/tNzG1qMksf
Day 88 - TRANSGENDER BAN: https://t.co/VDaUwyJqlc via @YouTube

Oh it's for sure a majority because other view points aren't allowed to speak freely. Which is my problem. https://t.co/zHdIgPMR0u
And when you are lecturing an entire country on what they should be doing as if your opinion is the only valid one, it doesn't help https://t.co/Sx1ooYVhLB
But they haven't. There are conservatives in Hollywood but they are scared to talk about it for fear of black listing https://t.co/Sx1ooYVhLB
No im saying we don't have consensus but the popular culture is ignoring the other side of the argument. https://t.co/maWYX00xJ4

@arnoldcam haha I'm being dramatic because of his ridiculous the response has been from people. I'm hoping and praying for unity soon
So Niki Hailey isnt qualified to be ambassador to the UN but Barack Obama WAS qualified to be president?? Oh the hypocrisy of the vanquished
@Melissa_Bolin I view that as very successful dating haha
@Melissa_Bolin haha I dated one person before Kate and then she and I dated and were engaged for 3 years before we got married haha
@Melissa_Bolin haha how would I know that that is going on?
#datingishardbecause people don't want to have to work for a relationship. They just move on to the next person. Love is a choice you make.

Ya? https://t.co/Ltsimwf1Pt
Haha no not really. They just tried to make that trailer soooo tragic looking so I was just commenting on that https://t.co/8K5Z5Qmjpc
Well I may need some serious help for a plethora of other reasons but my sarcasm is not one that I'm worried about. Haha https://t.co/E1F3kFHlYq
Haha that was kind of the point. They tried to make that trailer look like the start of some epic tragedy https://t.co/Mgh0qSy16Y
Cars 3 trailer has me emotionally on pause. How I view the world may be changed forever.
Haha I don't know for sure but possibly https://t.co/dSfwzYshRt
@sarinamay93 haha never apologize for that. Love that guy
I kinda wish Twitter had a translation feature built in because I have no idea what 50% of my timeline is talking about... love y'all tho!

Well what I want to do is find some people who can have serious but calm conversations and explain each side. https://t.co/UMwzhtK6sM
When daddy makes a scary noise haha. Nora is a clown in the mornings. #baby #nora #te https://t.co/kpHMzWb02T
Many people have. Which is sad. This country has made it through some truly tough times. We will make it through these next few months. https://t.co/yglO2VIMHD
You also have to remember that every candidate makes over the top promises. And most end up with a much more reasonable policy. https://t.co/WQeoUdBHwc
Well and some are calling for the electoral college to change the election results. Which would lead to epic destruction https://t.co/BUBBAbjMiI
@JudgeNatalie I agree.
@RandomPenguin @arnoldcam that's true. But it seems like most people do that to some extent or another
I want to do something to help. I just think the hate and anger is too fresh to have any real conversations yet. Hopefully soon https://t.co/ubkebb4YG0
@JudgeNatalie did you hear his speech when he won? Did you hear what he and Obama said? They're trying
Well one side is rioting all over the country and the other side has had some individual situations reported. Neither one brings us together https://t.co/NugVQ2kwj7
Unfortunately there has been a lot of violence and hate from both sides since the election. https://t.co/s8kCSv9jjD
@bbev91 of course I do!! You're the reason I cared about Harry Potter!
@MileyCyrus watched your video and would love to talk to you about it.
Happy Birthday to the United States Marine Corps. I pray for your safety and that you get the respect you deserve. #SemperFi
@KatrinaWink217 so do people paid to protest and cause violence. I'm just saying it's going to create stronger support for trump
@KatrinaWink217 there have been shootings and burning and vandalism. I totally support the right to protest but it gets a little crazy
The man you loved as president and the woman you voted for both asked for peace and patience.. instead we get #TrumpProtest #safezones
After all of the hate this election the three speeches from Donald, Hillary, and Obama gave me some hope for the future. Handled with class.
Stopped by a pretty park this afternoon to walk around and enjoy the weather and found something… https://t.co/JBDr53GiHQ

It's a weird feeling to watch the entire country hold its breath. It's like that moment between the explosion and the shockwave #ElectionDay
Things to do after voting 1. Breath 2. Apologize to your friends for all your recent posts. 3. Eat some tacos. #ElectionDay #iVoted #vote

Hey @waitbutwhy I think your ted talk must've just aired in Spanish cause I'm getting a bunch of tweets about how awesome I was haha.
Haha oh I know all about him and his ted talk. People have been asking me about it for months haha https://t.co/WNUUX2cozO

@di113 haha how bout dem boys!! But seriously what's wrong with Rodgers?
@bhawk_love85 I don't and I haven't but I know that it's very similar to the guitar in a lot of ways so it wouldn't be super hard to start
It's stories like this that make me realize how silly almost all of the things we fight about are in perspective. https://t.co/uZEZ405Aew
Peyton Manning when he sees all these tweets about is little brother... #eli #NYGvsMIN https://t.co/DRoK8kT19u
@bhawk_love85 @jonpeterlewis happy birthday!!
Haha I had some other ideas but I decided to keep them to myself https://t.co/8DK4XCLmSg
I would love to coin a phrase. You know something kind of like "coin a phrase".
@arnoldcam haha that's true. Maybe I should just avoid Twitter tonight
@EHvastovich @Canadian_Omar no chance! I love a good debate between two reasonable people. Just not angry ignorance. Haha
@DarkTriadMan haha friendly fire man. I was speaking about the really angry PC police who will fill twitter tonight.
I think Twitter should do the world massive favor and shut down during the debate. So many angry ignorant people... #debatenight
@Canadian_Omar I've heard something like that before as well
@bignliddle I'm just the only one admitting to it haha
Haha don't worry it's nothing personal and I still think you're awesome! Don't have to agree on everything https://t.co/2cj6vbu9Gt
He said that there were rapists and murders coming across the border along with everyone else. Which is %100 true. Never said all Mexicans https://t.co/jWeHzth5iO
Wait are you saying that raping women is the same as being married a couple times? And I'm also not worried if Europe hates our president https://t.co/1dNyxeJKZp
Haha Ted Cruz lied to the entire country. https://t.co/EIiqDwNcxF
He also hasn't taken millions of dollars from countries that kills homosexuals and treat women as property. https://t.co/YBIWIWtH5z
Trump has employed more minorities than Hillary has even thought about. He supported one of the first black men who ran for president. https://t.co/YBIWIWtH5z
His "charity" spends 70 percent on "expenses" donates 30 percent to charity. Spent more on travel than on actual charity https://t.co/HpmyYmURMF
He was accused of rape by at least three credible people. Not consensual relations. https://t.co/6wdgV5No0q
Seriously?? Have you read the accounts? I'm sorry man but that opinion is so misguided and wrong. https://t.co/BrYRF0q37K
My issue with the New Clinton add is that she conveniently ignores the multiple women she destroyed for accusing bill of sexual assault..
#MyAttitudeRightNowIsLike https://t.co/4wfIhW3Ij5
Proud of my buddy @ZackTremblay his magazine is legit! https://t.co/hnIYMbfHlT
I have to say that it is nice to see Twitter get excited about something besides politics for a change. Thanks #Brangelina I guess...
#Brangelina didn't work out. Which doesn't affect my life at all. Except now I get to read other people pretend it affects theirs... 🤔😒
I don't want an easy life. I want a life that requires me to pour myself out until I am empty and have nothing left to give, for Christ.
Haha I know https://t.co/yoJtz5nDWA
😳😳😁😁😁 https://t.co/jlxIqNsiX2
Well wait just a minute. Seems like we should be addressing the self hate thing not the money thing haha https://t.co/ohLXjm5ulQ
A little psalms truth today https://t.co/831eQi4Fdk
But you'd probably hate yourself at the end of the day because you helped ruin Twitter haha https://t.co/AsMDD8yjzy
Ya they really are! I'm not a fan https://t.co/pnERvJwIl1
Haha real is always better than fake https://t.co/CRtcu4nrPe
Apparently I need a different one haha https://t.co/A59QDYziI0
It's frustrating how Twitter has been taken over by fake accounts and people paid to tweet about some random thing to get it trending.
Time is meant to fly by. You aren't supposed to try and stop it. You are supposed to make the most of the time you have.
@inoahhiggins you in Duncanville?
Bella June is 2!!! https://t.co/BqKpx5SZ66
So two months is when babies are supposed to be rolling from back to front right?? Cause Nora is a champ at it haha
@KatrinaWink217 i don't agree with the premise. Who are the lunatics you're talking about?
@KatrinaWink217 part of which is the use of the African American community as political leverage without actually helping it.
The problem in this country is our failure to identify the actual root of the issue. https://t.co/6GDnciUvAv

Life happens whether you embrace it or not. It's not fair and never has been. But people have always overcome. Be one of those people.

I didn't even watch Jimmy Fallon last night but all of the hate he's getting for doing his job is hilarious! Thanks for the laughs y'all!
Never run from a challenge
Haters are always going to hate so make sure you're doing something worth having haters for.
Marshawn Lynch on #RunningWild is seriously hilarious!! I love this guy!
America is not perfect and never has been. But you have to ignore history completely to think that it is alone in it's checkered past.
15 years ago thousands died as heroes, while billions more watched as their lives changed forever. #NeverForget
@MikeDeWyze it seems like the world is lacking any real leaders right now.
Agreed but that problem only gets worse with more time wasted.  https://t.co/WLi8rKvQKq
So at what point does the world decide to try and handle the North Korea problem? When they test those nukes above ground?
If we could mute what people say and just watch what they do we would see through so many of the lies that surround us.
A guy just drove by me on the freeway smoking the nastiest smelling weed... Stay classy people. #mywindowsarentevendown
I'd have to disagree with you on that one but I respect your stance.  https://t.co/5wfvQ2SxMb
Most of the time what's popular isn't what's right. History remembers those who are willing to stand for what's right
I'm not worried about how many days I live. I'm worried about how I live the days that I have.

Well if anyone is going to know the truth of that it would be you! Haha how are you man? https://t.co/JwQm0fR1Ch
Until we have all the facts we still have to consider Ryan Lochte an idiot until proven guilty. #LochteGate
I don't. I'm actually flying to Miami tomorrow for a show and then I'll be back up here on the 24th https://t.co/vOsJpGuKss
@jackiesib9 that's what people are saying right now. Don't know for sure
@jester1436 ya I do sometimes. Life can look like a huge thing sometimes. But it's really just the next breath
I want Ryan Lochte back for the Tokyo Olympics to see if he can get caught up in a street racing gang war...
don't get me wrong I don't feel bad for him at all. I just think it's ironic because it DOES happen so much in rio https://t.co/f9cVfPclqp
Haha in his defense it's a pretty believable story  https://t.co/12vhjV2Y1h
It's all good because we all still got that epic visual regardless of the truth  https://t.co/u2u4X1vJdr
What you don't want to spring for some Waffle House?? Come on man you gotta keep it classy haha https://t.co/OmvNr8wuk9
How sad is it that #Lochte will probably get in more trouble for making up a story about getting robbed than if he had just robbed someone.

Rome wasn't built in a day. But it was built one day at a time. Great things don't just happen, you've got to put your head down and work.
Regardless of how you feel about yourself. You are wanted. You are important. You are loved. Believe that.
Whether or not we agree on politics or anything else for that matter. I still love all of you and hope and pray your life is blessed
Though I definitely think there are a plethora of talented Asian actors who could have done the job as well or better in The Great Wall.
the anger about Matt Damon in The Great Wall only proves they made the right move. Wouldn't know the movie existed otherwise.

I don't care what "god" they claim to serve. They are murdering and enslaving innocent people and need to be stopped. Baghdad.

Haha I've been all over this country and Texas drivers aren't much worse than anywhere else. They just have trucks https://t.co/WAOSHLedu8
#GrowingUpInTexas I learned what it means to be American because we know what it means to be Texan.
I feel like Google is that annoying friend who's always saying "I told you so" .... @google #google
When you wake up tomorrow remember that the mistakes you made today are history and not prophesy. You don't have to make them again.

Wednesday wisdom. We are individual people. Don't let your interaction with one ruin your relationships with another.
Haha I definitely could've used that when I was designing my house  https://t.co/WGnIqI6tyv
Well as far as the Twitter world allows you've got one  https://t.co/MqYQ2KmbCo
I don't want to always be right. I want to always be love to the world around me.
No one is promised tomorrow. No one is promised today. Love God,  Love others. That's all there is to it.

I love talking about this stuff but I don't want it to ever get personal so thanks!  https://t.co/lxqaSSnwMG
She's super conversational now!! Not sure what she's saying but she seems to know haha https://t.co/IrpnBSoCll
@arnoldcam ya it would only work if the US and Europe were willing to fight to keep them safe
@BentheLegendary I haven't yet but I want to. Don't have much time to go to the movies right now with the new baby about to get here haha
@chriskrokshow looks like republicans have to find a new football to play with now that George Will took his and went home haha
I agree with that as well. But I think as long as Russia is involved it will take western intervention https://t.co/8JlNisqMPt
Ya I know they don't care if you're Muslim or Christian. If you don't support them you will die.  https://t.co/ItqmsU5GqU
I think there's a difference between jihad based terrorism and the largely gang and drug related shootings.  https://t.co/lS90Cby6xX
I think the world should do what has already been proposed and create and defend safe zones inside Syria  https://t.co/rb3P95PVoS
Are using the immigrant crisis to get more terrorists into Europe and the US that seems like a bad thing.  https://t.co/57VSrTqRxY
Oh I know the problem is bigger than just un vetted immigration. But when ISIS says themselves that they https://t.co/57VSrTqRxY
Are you seriously not watching what is happening all over the world? France? Germany? Belgium?  https://t.co/QoL0SJVBYX
Haha I bet we agree on way more than you'd think  https://t.co/i46XfQ6NwH
It's a global issue that every country is facing. I'm just glad England is taking ownership of its own safety.  https://t.co/WgVSkSIFDS
Haha so watching world events and taking a historical view based on how nationals rise and fall is fear mongering?  https://t.co/PmXrswK5Rn
I couldn't agree more. My only hope is that this strengthens England and makes them more secure  https://t.co/Y8TW3MPW5M
Don't even have cable tv haha. But hey nice try :)  https://t.co/mXGxFhBgzf
Ya I believe they are concerned that the economy isn't growing fast enough to support the current pace.  https://t.co/GBYLHyEg6J
So the answer is to let others in instead of stopping the flow and trying to prevent homegrown ones from acting?  https://t.co/ijWcY1cy8p
And Germany and France have both had pretty awful terrorist attacks because of no border control  https://t.co/0ixpwKsZJR
English aren't trying to stop Germans and French from coming in. They're trying to stop terrorists  https://t.co/0ixpwKsZJR
Haha it means I'm a Tim Urban guy.  https://t.co/c6JvuZtWgE
But if a country wants to control its own borders and take ownership of its safety I don't think it's a bad thing https://t.co/0fD3AimLwE
Isn't it about stopping terrorists from getting into the country with refugees that haven't been vetted properly?  https://t.co/eJd5TMtGce
It's just funny to me to see how Twitter reacts and then how the real world reacts. Always very different https://t.co/fv08l0urqQ
Haha no the UK Twitter world is in uproar. It doesn't represent the majority of English. Obviously haha https://t.co/BibEGghjK7
#Brexitvote just reshaped Europe and I bet in a couple hours Kim Kardashian or someone else will overtake the top trending spot haha
I don't know how it will work out but if it leads to a stronger England I'd think that would be good. If not.. https://t.co/k4Dj1OQqdN
So England voted to leave EU and David Cameron is resigning. I guess we are all just waiting to see how that will effect the EPL #BrexitVote
@tjf_1997 what are y'all up to?
Happy Birthday!! https://t.co/p8Ma6YI7Mx
It's sad to me that so many people spend their time pointing out the worlds problems instead of finding a solution to even one of them.
What dreams are you hiding inside because you're afraid that people won't believe you can do it?
@Canadian_Omar Kate is about a week away from delivering our second haha

I'm just biding my time till I'm old enough to run haha https://t.co/gRfWOnxtqT
@Canadian_Omar or it's about the woman running who is taking millions from countries that kill gay people and oppress women.
Every day I check what's trending to see if I care about any of it... But sadly it's all either political nonsense or just regular nonsense
Sleep is like that nice cold drink of water after a long summer day.

So what are y'all up to?
Your life is so much more than 140 characters can possibly capture. Live your life outside those confines
@JontezMusic it definitely does! Could be both sad and happy
Strawberry Moon tonight. Crazy to think that billions of people will look at that moon tonight. It's a small world after all.
I have a love hate relationship with history. I love learning about it but I hate how much evil has been the main character in the story.

To know what grace really is is to be humbled by the depth of love it takes pardon the very people who tried to kill God himself.
Bella uses anything she can get her hands on as a mic haha. She's a daddy's girl for sure :)… https://t.co/oacWCaHazc

We mistake loneliness for the need for physical company. Truth is that our deepest need is to be in communion with the creator of our soul.

Haha well I appreciate the passion  https://t.co/uO5Klgxuj3
@Music_Maniac08 that's pretty funny!
Art imitates life and sometimes life returns the favor. I want to create the kind of art that is worth imitating.
It's the rain that makes the sun feel so warm. It's the tears that make joy so alive. It's the hate that makes love something to cling to.

Without Christ love is just an emotion. With Christ love is the medication that can heal the world.
I can't help but wonder when it was that we as people lost our sense of respect and selflessness. We are stronger when we put others first.

Abortion - My personal thoughts.: https://t.co/tdJ24ZwKTP via @YouTube
.@olsonbjorno I definitely agree that we need better education. I just also think that needs to start with admitting that it's a person.
Where exactly do you find biblical backing for abortion? As a Christian I can't.  https://t.co/eaqKpIxkIJ
So was slavery and segregation until people realized it was wrong.  https://t.co/lt4kHwnmrj
So the baby girls do too or no?  https://t.co/aVM17eDMNf
So your defense of aborting babies is that i can't afford to adopt all of them???  https://t.co/ov8Vdg1zp1
Haha that's not the constitution. If you want to talk about court decisions we can. Courts supported slavery too https://t.co/xRixB4dYeb
Please show me which part of the constitution protects or provides the right to destroy your offspring?  https://t.co/DGVRMlS5iX
Haha if you think I've got wealth and security you are sadly mistaken.  https://t.co/qLe3SytiRS
I don't understand how abortion is a right when it literally denies millions of children their right to LIFE and LIBERTY!! #StopTheSham
I'm 100% on board for women's rights. As in I believe my unborn daughter has the right to "life, liberty and happiness" #StopTheSham
It sad to me that we won't even give babies the 9 months of protection they need before they arrive in this crazy world.. #StopTheSham
Me: *turns on the news  News: "THE WORLD IS GOING INSANE!!" Me: "sounds about right" Me: *switches over to Netflix
Turns out I had left my phone in my car :) but for about 10 minutes of frantic searching I thought the worst...
Immediately after starting a load of laundry I realized I didn't know where my phone was.....
See I think a large part of the country is only thinking about what's good for them. Which is a problem https://t.co/qBqzm27qLm

Happy birthday!  https://t.co/opZQqntp2R
All I want to do is communicate love. But not just any love. The Love of Christ. #loveismore #truth
@GirlyBrooke85 happy birthday!!
The life of Christ is not simply a picture of love. It is the definition of Love. #truth #loveismore
Christianity is not about us being perfect. It's about the love of Christ coming into a broken world and offering us freedom. #loveismore

Well I enjoy a well thought out political discussion. My family has been having them for years haha https://t.co/wAN1MahHlz
Haha I don't know if you're serious or being sarcastic but thanks  https://t.co/5pfLvFZZGD
Agreed but so do they. Iran isn't even releasing US prisoners that they have captive.  https://t.co/zV3vQEIpDK
Goodnight! https://t.co/uIbXARHV7k
I didn't say no diplomacy. Just no nukes haha https://t.co/MSlNdoKIGV
I wouldn't regulate it. I wouldn't work with them at all on a deal that gave them nuclear capabilities.  https://t.co/4KT4YFRKTd
Haha well I don't think we should help them get nukes either haha https://t.co/FnmfnfQwV3
It's nice to see that Iran is on a first name basis with us aka "Great Satan." It's a good thing they don't hate us and our allies....
Well that's sad haha https://t.co/mOrdekTE49
Where there is no love there is no Christ. You can not show Christ without showing love. #truth #loveismore #bemore
Yes you can haha. Thanks! https://t.co/khB4zI1Xs5
Braxton Miller pulled off a move that would have torn the ACL of a lesser man. #braxtonmiller #ohiostate

It's all clear no worries :) https://t.co/5Wo7h0DIGo
Because I wanted to see what was happening haha https://t.co/uqZxMx0i2k
That moment when you think you hear gun shots outside and then find a shell casing in the street that is still hot....

@milaceccato I'm great!
He is one of the nicest guys I met on the show!  https://t.co/3BZW0PhwU0
@milaceccato howdy!
No problem! I always knew you were too big for the idol stage to hold! https://t.co/nK3GOsO4d8
Congrats to @toddyrockstar on the show!! #TodrickMTV love seeing people from our season succeed!! #todrick
Change has to happen in the heart first. The rest of the body will follow! Goodnight yall!
First she'd need to know that I exist haha https://t.co/ni5XoKkEuw
Truth https://t.co/ezUOgAqu5U
Social media is a mirror of the existing problems.  https://t.co/9C5BDxLNwG
Just saw the awful things people are saying about Kim K tonight. SHE'S HAVING A BABY!!! I'm truly saddened by the ignorance and hate.
Oh on a side note I will be hopefully doing at least one online show this week!!
Well the VMA's are over... So I guess my live tweeting is over as well... Thank you everyone for hanging with me!! #VMAs
Epic debates!! https://t.co/2zStcpgx9W
Wasn't planning on it but it just kinda happened haha https://t.co/2qEVVaO9Qj
I can't understand what @MileyCyrus is saying. Well besides that she "smokes pot".... I would never have guessed haha #VMAs #MileyCyrus
HIIIIIII!!!! https://t.co/AOzw1DvgJn
Oh Miley... What is happening right now...? #MileyCyrus #VMAs
Even though she has won basically everything at this point it still seems like @taylorswift13 is truly grateful. #taylorswift #classy #VMAs
Hey! Miss you too! https://t.co/HtSlgqzUaO
I agree completely! https://t.co/nYjwaAZNEw
So far my fav performances have been @justinbieber and @ToriKelly both talented and very real! #JustinBieber #ToriKelly
I mean i'll see what I can do.. but I'm pretty sure what I can do is not rap... https://t.co/ByXK9DR8Yg
well thanks! https://t.co/LSGazA9eco
I could totally be a rapper if I could only talk faster... #VMAs
haha well thanks! https://t.co/RCAjFiE6L0
I'm too young...but I totally would!  https://t.co/33rNcz4vU0
On second thought if Kanye could get all the crazy world leaders to enjoy some "brownies" with him it might chill them out. #kanyewest #VMAs
They would be considered tame and boring now I think... https://t.co/tGOhIfVVkk
haha sorry my perspective has changed quite a bit after having a baby girl https://t.co/XOGJ3jfqaX
Well I still love you! https://t.co/4xYk4b0saW
Miley Cyrus.... So many things to say but mostly.... I miss Hannah.... #VMAs #MileyCyrus
Well that's terrifying.. https://t.co/LD3G58GhN3
my bad.... https://t.co/8FK9FNm146
Did @kanyewest just say that it wasn't about him and then announce he was running for president? after saying he was high? #kanyewest #VMAs
its all about art...or something...  https://t.co/qp8Mx07kvJ
No disrespect to Kanye but Taylor Swift had the best speech.... #taylorswift #kanyewest #VMAs
I'm not even sure what Kanye won tonight. But this speech is definitely about something deep... or weed... #kanyewest #VMAs
seriously what is happening.... https://t.co/sMTFJCKEVe
I don't understand Kanye most of the time... I know it's probably just me... but again Taylor Swift is unbelievably classy! #VMAs
I think @taylorswift13 is one of the classiest people in the entertainment industry. #TaylorSwift #VMAs
Haha if I ever become perfect I will begin to judge other people for their imperfections. Until then I'm good  https://t.co/1MHFeCnSrz
Thank you @ToriKelly for putting on a vocal lesson for everyone....wow... I wish I was a quarter of the singer you are!! #VMAs #torikelly
Then it's a really good stunt. But for some reason I doubt it.  https://t.co/i2aJhrDues
There was something honest and emotional about the end of @justinbieber performance. It was different than the rest. #JustinBieber #VMAs
That performance by @justinbieber has made me respect him even more. I'm impressed! #VMAs #JustinBieber
Thank you!  https://t.co/LagatyIMFK
You're awesome! https://t.co/ECeHvecCMW
