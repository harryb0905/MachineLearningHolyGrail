Hey #HillaryClinton, Donald Trump is beating you.  Maybe wiping your hackable server wasn't such a good idea. https://t.co/tfk1pGQPIy
Apparently Hillary has already forecast what America will do. Is she right or dreaming? https://t.co/eWzcB2cQl2
#HillaryClinton said today that she feels "very, very good about where" her campaign is. Really? What do you think?
I wonder if #WikiLeaks is going to buy the hacked #Hillary email for a half a million? Good idea/bad idea?

@amyasherk @NolteNC Too bad, you're missing a lot of good stuff
The reason I mentioned Jeb Bush earlier was because Bush flew an airplane over the Donald Trump stadium with a taunting banner‚Ä¶.
@ClintRJBa I was responding to somebody
@swannoir27 Siri
I think 'Jeb Bush', would do very well!
@lweatonNC @realDonaldTrump just reporting what he said‚Ä¶
How many people would be in that stadium next Friday night, for 'Jeb Bush'? Mr. Bush' that's the challenge, take it!

@GroverNorquist sorry Grover, no THREE BUCK CHUCK!
Seriously, what are the chances Hillary does an hour speech, UNSCRIPTED, with no prompter, just her ideas?
We read a TelePrompTer to start and end segments (to promote what's coming up) the rest, unscripted  https://t.co/P5883NV4Lb
Yes, intros and outros NOT a whole presentation https://t.co/wrWuhvLp2P
@realDonaldTrump just did a ratings survey, who liked Fox? LOTS of applause. CNN? some applause/some boos. MSNBC? Mostly boos on our TV
Could the current president give an extemporaneous speech like @realDonaldTrump? This guy speaks for an hour with no TelePrompTer!
