@ethan_sullens @Oinks_n_Squeels It’s a 30 day elimination diet. It’s easier to explain the things you CAN eat as opposed to the things you CANT... you can eat: meat, veggies, fruit. Basically a #paleodiet. No grains/bread, added sugar/alcohol...
I started the #whole30 today. Anybody else doing this?
the first music video is getting ready for release. It’s a collab with @sprorgnsm’s @robostrange. I have a lot to be thankful for, and a lot to look forward to. I love you and miss you and can’t wait to reconnect with you. Happy new year! 😘🎶🎶 https://t.co/cpbeLQwJ9b
then we’d go on stage, rock out, and leave. After Dada and a headlining show at @thehifiindy, we meet up with @houndmouth for some fun gigs on the east coast. The road journey continues from there... https://t.co/stQTteQzNO
in Feb, we play our first show of the year at the first venue I ever played in Deep Ellum. @ClubDadaDFW is near and dear to my heart cuz I was only 14yrs old when @johndavidkent and I played there with our band @Radishmusic.

Those walks were a terrible idea. Sometimes the math wins, sometimes the heart wins. In game 7's i suspect the heart has a better chance.

@MattTheE @markstepro: @thelizlambert taught me everything about it but toupee's aren't really her thing. She knows all about Mexico though.
@MattTheE BUT, the proper term for what @markstepro wears is "drug rug". I think "poncho" is the slang term but thats less PC so watch out.
@MattTheE yes! It is! BUT that's more of an obscure slang term used when discussing toupees made of hash. @markstepro
@markstepro I appreciate that you dug through your past mentions and found that little diamond in the rough!!!! Miss you mayun. xo

me and evan (@thelemonheads) were writing a song In the main cabin. They kept dropping ppl out into the sky near the mountaintops.
I had to take a small jetski-like space pod out to find Dorian and bring him back. I heard him singing from a mountain cave.
I brought dorian back and kept working on the song but we decided it sounded just like "take it easy"!!
Fuck it was strange but. But great seeing evan and great saving my boy. The feeling of flying through space with him on my back was unreal.

@juniorcasemiro perhaps it's sad but I generally don't conduct my twitter account with much professionalism. @averagecabbage @hansonmusic
@juniorcasemiro sorry man. Wish I could take credit for it. I just read it, thought it was clever & reposted it. It's about the password. :)
@maisquared and 100% of the dudes aboard The Silver Surfer wear plaid! damn...
Amen... RTd: @Schwarzenegger: Talking to great innovators who can lead us to a green future today. It's time for the US to lead on energy.
I agree with @patrick_wilson: Charlie Sheen is living the dream.

g'mornin' Indy. playing @thevogue tonight. this morning i am testing benkweller.com beta site and going over designs for the mobile app.
Just woke up. crazy good dreams last night! ended with me & my "old friends" Cal Ripken jr. (@RipkenBaseball) and Dave Winfield standing...
behind home plate at a sandlot game somewhere. Cal came up to me and said, "BEN!" and gave me a huge hug. he said, "it's Cal Ripken jr!"...
i said "holy shit man, you remember me from the orioles shirt i wore when i was 8 with the ringer-sleeves??" he said, "tooootally bro."...
The Silver Surfer was parked right behind us so we went on the bus and i introduced them to the others hanging in the front lounge...
the bus was a wreck. the doors were ripped out of the frames. garbage everywhere. this lobster/crab type animal was dead on the floor...
it was pre-boiled nice and red. looked yummy. big fucker too. Cal, Dave and I walked over it and went to my back room to grab some swag.
unopened packs of baseball cards were strewn about; unopened action figures hung on the pegboard wall. Cal dove right in to opening cards...
dave grabbed a toy off the wall and started opening it. I was like "wait! not that one Dave, I'm saving that one."...
Dave said, "it's cool man. it's already been opened." and showed me how indeed it had been. The hard part is remembering what toy it was...
phone rang and woke me up but it was a special toy like @Jesus or @GeneSimmons. but it had been opened so Dave got to play with it!...
@tomatemaravilha I'll put you on the list with 2 tix. What name shall I use?
@camueller well that's even cooler because it's not only rare as hell, it's also an error. Remember the Billy Ripken "fuck face" card!?
