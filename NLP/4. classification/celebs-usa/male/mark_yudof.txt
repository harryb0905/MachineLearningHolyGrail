More on @Schwarzenegger's proposed constitutional amendment to fund universities here: http://bit.ly/5xM2SY
a bold, impressive state of the state speech by @Schwarzenegger. Choosing higher ed over prison spending
Gov's constitutional amendment would set university funding at 10% of general fund; prisons @ 7 %. This is a bold, innovative proposal.
Gov: "Never again will we spend higher percentage on prisons than on higher education."  Yes!
Gov: CA priorities out of whack"; prisons get 45% more than universities. "No way to proceed into the future." Now he's talking!
Gov: Current tax and budget system is "cruel", forces us to make choices among our obligations. Now he's talking about education!
Schwarzenegger says "the worst is over for California's economy." Now time to reform tax and budgeting systems to serve the economy.
Gov's priorities: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. UC can help here -- a lot. University is an engine of job creation.
Gov. tells story about "the pony and the pig", his pets work together to raid snack supply ; so, he says, can gov. and lawmakers cooperate.

Check out my remarks from the Regent's meeting this am: Because of Youtube’s time restrictions, the video is split up into 3 parts...
RT @UCStudentRegent SRD Jesse Cheng making some outstanding comments on need for State investment and UC need to outreach to public as well.
Thanks @UCStudentRegent Jesse Bernal for kind words. Respect our different points of view on necessity of fee increases. No one likes them.
RT @UCStudentRegentdiscussion of student regents: fee increases will not impact low income families because of federal and state aid.
RT @UCRegentLiveVP Lenz is doing a crazy job of telling us the statistics that will be hurting  UC, I can barely keep up! http://tr.im/yScz
telling Board If anyone has better plan than mine, I'm for it. But no one can compromise access to and quality of UC.  Thanks for standing O
Regent Blum: it's "demonstrably silly" that Board and I are blamed for what’s happening. We'll offer a free bus ticket to Sacramento.
We're back. Extraordinarily kind expressions of support from Regents Gould and Lansing, from Chancellors and faculty. I'm deeply grateful.
Exceptional police work on the part of UCSF officers. They are patient, professional and extremely skilled. Our thanks to them.
Lots of shouting. Be nice if everyone shouting respected the free speech rights of the rest of us. We'll take a break until we can resume.
RT @UCRegentLive  a lot of labor, students here protesting Regents actions. Def the hardest part of any Regents mtg. http://tr.im/yRYE
getting ready for public comment at the Board of Regents meeting @ UCSF.  Huge crowd. No one's happy about fee increases; that includes me.
big laughs when Reed suggests doing away w 12th grade in CA. "It's a waste of time, money and effort." Then pass savings to comm. colleges.
Reed: CA doesn't look or act like CA when the Master Plan was passed 50 years ago. We are far more diverse; need to close achievement gap
Reed says maybe we should talk about "rationing" admissions if the state won't pay. He will try to cut 30,000 CSU spots.
Reed: I've been in government for 40 years; never seen a budget cut like this. "It's the mother of all reductions." CA shouldn't be #1 here.
Kind words from Chancellor Charlie Reed who warns all three segments of higher ed. must work together as never before to escape our crisis.
Chancellor Jack Scott warns that CA has to produce more holders of 4-year degrees if the state is to remain competitive.
Listening to Chancellor Charlie Reed of CSU and Chancellor Jack Scott of Cal. Community Colleges talk about impact of budget cuts on them.
liking Jesse's blog, except for this crack: "Yudof’s bad joke of the day: Denial is not just a river in Egypt."  Must I explain?
Student Regent Jesse Cheng is tweeting circles around me at the Regents' Retreat. How's he do it? Must be one of those generational things.
At UC Regents Retreat, taking a strategic look about how to reposition University in these awful budgetary times.
Listening to sober report from State Finance Director Mike Genest re how California got $60 billion in the hole. It directly affects UC.
Chatting with NYTimes magazine for their upcoming education issue. Should be a good one!
Exciting game. #UCD football has student support, great qtrbk, energized team + tasty hotdogs. I predict a good season despite early losses.
@UC Davis football game to cheer for the Aggies in their home opener vs. Montana. I love college football--its my favorite time of the year!
