Top 3 players to me that have a Complete effect on a game and defenses have to make Complete adjustments and changes are Lebron,Steph and AD in that order.... I’m not sayin KD ain’t the 2nd best hooper in the world cuz to me he is but the Effect in the defense just Different!!
It’s mind blowin to me that ESPN n other networks push the Lebron1 KD2 thing so much and other young guys and don’t have stephin in there top 5 like huh just cuz he a PG 🤷🏽‍♂️?? Do u see the effect he has on games and the fear Defenses have when he has the 🏀

😂😂😂 facts... don’t get a shake that’s a 15$+ combo rt there!! https://t.co/cV9YtdbTcG
@Buckeye_Salsero @e_rav24 @Lakers Personally I don’t think Kemba would be as good for LBJ cuz he needs the ball in his hands more to create his shots not as good of a catch n shoot player like Dame and Dame used to playin on an off the ball with CJ and still puts up crazy numbers
@e_rav24 Obviously Magic and the rest of the world ain’t dumb better go after em
@e_rav24 KD wants the max Steph got his and I know personally 🤫 Klay wants his max when he up paid his dues so the odd man out when it all said and done is draymon he gunna be the one takein a pay cut as he should cuz he’s the 4th most valuable of the 4 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
@e_rav24 Bruh u know there’s a cap basically n luxury tax he gunna have to take the mid level if he was a say and KD already said “he waitin for the money comein to him” he wants the max next year 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ that Japanese service must be slow lol
@e_rav24 Bro are u smokein crack omfg lol this a audition for him to go somewhere after the year done!! That’s it!! Dubs keepin the core 4 together for as long as they can period... boogie wana get paid and that ain’t happening on the warriors!!
@e_rav24 Bro Lebron AD and Dame is a great counter to the W’s that rt there is scary and would really counter what the warriors got think bout it 🤔 💭
@e_rav24 Huh?? Lol what u Talkin bout!!!! I said they gunna try but he not signing there. And I said Dame Lillard!! He’s a bum that can’t shoot now?? He the best PG to pair wit Lebron catch and shoot and knows how to play off the ball(CJ) and u have AD.. no1 outshooting the W’s Be logical
@e_rav24 Ain’t gunna happen!! Better wait for AD n trade for Dame Dolla!!
@ReseRice4 called it the other day too lol said he was goin for 50 on 9.5 dribbles 😭😭😭😭
