Dwight is live right now on KPCC talking about his new album #3Pears - listen live here: http://t.co/BTzAY8kZ
"@obeyyourclaudia: I'm not into country much, but I'm a happy puppy right now." Happier than a pig in mud, that makes more sense to DrBob.
Glad you‚Äôre excited for #3PEARS. @Trinity4h, but you have to wait until Sept 18. Apparently patience is a virtue, but DrBob prefers whiskey.
"@ShyShyCow14: @DwightYoakam @RollingStone Who or what is a Dr Bob?." DrBob is the coolest guy on Music Row. Also, I‚Äôm real humble.
"@DameStyle: So sue me, I like @DwightYoakam's music." DrBob‚Äôs attorney stopped answering his calls or he‚Äôd take you up on that.
