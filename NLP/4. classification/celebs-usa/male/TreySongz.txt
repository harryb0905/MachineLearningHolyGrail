@NoahGeissler @JuhBoyJarod yes people do realize that. You are not realizing that WE get no justice and this is a clear example of it.
@NoahGeissler so the all lives matter argument is still favoring us, when we get no justice for police violence against us.
@NoahGeissler u must understand that police kill unarmed blacks and get paid leave, where as in this case they are arrested Asap.
I come home ALLL the time. ALL THE TIME https://t.co/qpJsD5BlwX
@_JohnB21 @NoahGeissler thank you John!!!!
@NoahGeissler that would be the difference. The very distinct difference in our two worlds. As I said these men were charged immediately.
Do you understand that when unarmed black people's lives are taken by police, very seldom is anyone is charged &amp; hardly ever convicted? https://t.co/Weolt46pxT

That being said, can only hope that she means things she's said. Going to pray about it. I'm happy with what she said about my people though
Politics are politics though, very rarely do we see actuality of the changes people claim they want to make.

I'm so disappointed that this man can sit up here and say the most bizarre untrue shit and be a possible president
I've actually started it! https://t.co/8swK8uyEtC
Systemic racism. Systematic slavery https://t.co/nLo0soCB1w
Systematic Slavery -  (13th amendment - Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime...) created for us.
Wealthy whites used the same drug and walked away with their lives still in tact as far as the law is concerned
Increasing mass incarceration of US, aka systematic slavery. Of course crack was given to us as a cheaper form of cocaine while...
While the Clinton administration years later would pass drug laws that made crack and cocaine have different legal punishments
Stop and frisk was early 80's modeled for mass incarceration of blacks as the crack era exploded.
Haven't chosen to endorse either thus far. https://t.co/rpZx5D7py1
Yup sure is. https://t.co/RYCDYy5Hix
@CNN quote that part. The black man IS treated different than the white man.
Let's go!!!! That's what I want to hear
Yea cause that shows she cares. She has the chance to speak to us all RIGHT NOW and show us she cares https://t.co/YWZkM99oqR
No she didn't https://t.co/kX4ES7svOl
The question is about racial divide and black people being shot by police and he's talking about his FOP endorsement. Fuckin clown g
Police need to be held accountable when they murder people like everybody else, can a presidential candidate say that? Nope
Let's hear this shit

@angela_rye Great job on CNN!
@mata_zayda and you were misinformed. Pls read this tweet from @DallasPD https://t.co/7OWlT1mSJ3
Indeed. Just trying to educate those who don't understand.  https://t.co/GmkxrZ7b6W
@ArleneGonzalez2 @DallasPD endangered him falsely &amp; shld apologize, if you don't agree. I wish u better understanding. As U r simple minded
At what point did I mention race? I only asked that this man name be cleared. U obviously can't keep up w the convo https://t.co/97WssTcdGq
Once again, they have NOT APOLOGIZED which is why I'm speaking Daniel. Check for yourself @DallasPD  https://t.co/GozdH2cw04
He was released and is not a suspect. Which is my whole point Daniel.  https://t.co/d8sV89iWtW
Perfectly within his rights. Be educated before speaking about things with me pls.  https://t.co/f3UGJOUTRw
Public humiliation and worse endangering his life without clearing it up is unacceptable. Don't tell me calm down https://t.co/tQeF4kQRJ7
@ArleneGonzalez2 @DallasPD get your facts right. Dallas PD posted the pic calling him a SUSPECT. You would not be comfortable had it been u
@DallasPD #MarkHughesIsInnocent #ClearHisName. Pls retweet this https://t.co/KfyjCQNdCw
Good idea Jake https://t.co/HSLhIq4Q78
Deleting with no explanations and of clearance of his name via the same network they used to make him a vigilante  https://t.co/YggYP3NGPl
In person is great but as they let the world know of his suspicion WRONGLY they should do the same about innocence https://t.co/v0lR0J8PYy
@KyleCallihan @DallasPD yet no information about the real shooters released via Twitter. He has thousands of death threats already.
@DallasPD meanwhile people are still tweeting this mans name and picture as if he is a killer. Clarification on your part is necessary.
@YoureAllNutz @DallasPD the point is people want to kill this man. When you point the finger and say "cop killer" u must retract!
@DallasPD NO retraction, no admittance of wrong doing. Just endanger this mans life and because a tweet is deleted it's ok.
So @DallasPD put this man's life in danger, posted his face for all to see as a cop killer. And when he's cleared, they just delete it.
Prayers &amp; Love to the families &amp; friends of the officers lost in Dallas. "Hate can't drive out Hate. Only love can do that" We need love!!
https://t.co/h2AjJsHZFx
But those that turn blind eyes are just as guilty &amp; those who object to us speaking out think the same as the policemen that take our lives
I appreciate and thank the people not of black or brown color that understand our pain. That see the truth with ease and hurt when we do.
Many white people, not all,  hv made it a point to deem those who speak against these murders, as racists. Or speak as if racism isn't real
Shot four times, with a child in the car.
I take a flight and spend some time off of my phone to get away only to learn another black man has been shot and killed by the police.
Happy Independence Day!!!!

I don't rant, this isn't that. TRIGGA #1 album "NaNa" "Touchin Lovin" and "What's Best For You" all #1 on one chart or another. #Grammys ijs
So please, don't take this next sentiment as salt, shade, envy, etc. The Grammys shortchange culture for popularity every year.
10 years I been able to feed my family and have the support of so many people, just for doing what I would do anyway for NOTHING. Music
