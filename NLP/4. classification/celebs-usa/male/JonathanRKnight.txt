@FrederickKeys  your exploitation of monkeys to entertain is disheartening. There are many other ways to bring people to your ball games that don’t put innocent animals under stress and at risk of harm.
So sad to hear @FrederickKeys has monkey rodeo nights where they force monkeys to ride on the backs of dogs while they heard goats. So inhumane!!!! Please let them know this is not right and don’t attend games until they stop!

@Conqueror1991 I don't like cats! And the cat will eat the mouse. Mouse is just trying to stay warm for the winter so it can live it's life. I'll catch it and put it in the hay trailer he can build a warm nest in there 😜
Dear mouse in my house... if we're gonna share living space over the winter, please don't run across the floor when I'm awake! Now I'm gonna have to trap you and put you back out in the cold barn. Better get a winter coat bitch!
