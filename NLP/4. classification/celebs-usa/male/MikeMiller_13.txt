What an awesome performance by 2 absolute legends @KDTrey5 &amp; @KingJames.  Congrats to the @warriors on their championship. #NBAFinals
.@KDTrey5 is having one of the best #NBAFinals closeout games in the history of the @NBA.
.@TheRealJRSmith giving the @Cavs a huge spark.  If Love can string a few shots together the @Cavs will be in business.
@kenthornhill Unfortunately he has passed away a few years back.
@Blarneysbar The shooter is initiating contact for sure.  The foul shouldn't be called.
That was a impressive 38-19 run by the @warriors to end the half.  The @cavs made some plays late to make 2nd half interesting. #NBAFinals
Let's see if this brief stop of play can stop the @warriors run.
.@cavs can't win a rat race.  Need to out execute the @warriors to win. #NBAFinals
That's a huge 2nd foul on Klay.  He is the toughest defender the @warriors have to guard Kyrie.
.@cavs need to keep trapping Ball Screens when Zaza sets them.  Make the @warriors throw it him and make him be the playmaker.
When your stars make defensive plays like @KyrieIrving and @KingJames it sets the tone of a ball game.  #NBAFinals
You will pay the price every time when you give up a FT rebound.  Early momentum play.
It's on!!!! Game 5 of the #NBAFinals.  #DefendTheLand #DubNation https://t.co/bknKMTk9Wj
.@JokicNikola15 is going to be a problem.  ⚒⚒⚒https://t.co/bzJ7X9oQQ7
@Ben_Larson21 @cavs If the @cavs keep playing tough &amp; physical on defense they will have a chance.
A LeBron James dunk straight out of a video game fired up the crowd, while the Cavs' flurry of 3s... - via @ESPN App https://t.co/RSO0SBdAWI
Tyrone Lue shortened his bench and @Cavs played more physical.  Ladies and gentlemen we have a game 5 in Oakland.
This guy @KingJames.  😳 https://t.co/pwe0LVauUA
.@Cavs don't turn the ball over &amp; limit possessions, there is not enough possessions left in the game if you play late in the clock.
.@KingJames in transition. https://t.co/1cOoFGRaeU
.@cavs should put the ball in @KingJames &amp; @KyrieIrving late in the clock to limit the possessions here on out.
.@KyrieIrving don't do them with the lefty float game. #NBAFinals
This guy @KyrieIrving is special!
@theMANNevent @cavs @warriors You are definitely right.  @warriors make quick runs.
The @cavs punched 1st and punched hard.  Will the @warriors respond or will they lay down and take this series back to the bay?
Here is where the @cavs have been tested all series.  When they start dipping into their bench.  They must keep the energy &amp; momentum.
.@cavs are playing a much more physical brand of ball tonight.  They must go old school eastern conference basketball to win.
Great energy early for the @Cavs.  JR Smith making big early contributions.  Cavs looking like they want to extend series.
@dpeterka23 Thanks for coming to the show!
About to be on The Jump on ESPN.  Check us out.
@Supp_Jill Yes
If any team can make history and come back from a 3-0 deficit in the #NBAFINALS it is the @KingJames &amp; @KyrieIrving led @cavs.
.@warriors with 11 straight points to end the game.  😳
.@KDTrey5 playing like he is from another planet right now.  #NBAFINALS
Get ready for the ending of this game! The Stars are playing like stars &amp; the role players are excelling in their roles. #NBAFinals
@Reagan_Watkins @conepop They are going to have limit turnovers and poor shots.  You can not let @warriors get into transition.
You have to keep the @warriors out of transition.  Poor shots and turnovers crush you.  #NBAFINALS
Getting excited to watch Game 3 of the #NBAFINALS.  I think the @cavs will play much better in the Q.
Getting ready to hit @FirstTake to talk about #NBAFINALS.  Can the @cavs recover from their trip to the Bay?
This guy @KDTrey5 is a special talent. 😳
Basketball is a game of runs.  #NBAFinals
That's a good first half of basketball. #NBAFinals

Congrats to good friend @JasonDufner on an amazing @MemorialGolf tourney win! Battled adversity, some start &amp; stop play!  Impressive. https://t.co/2Rq2sFcu6H
The @warriors were electric tonight. @cavs are going to limit turnovers, slow the tempo down, &amp; rebound better to have a chance. #NBAFinals
.@kingjames downhill in transition. https://t.co/JPs5PZNOH5
If the first quarter of the #NBAFinals is any indication of the rest of the series we will be in for an epic one.

@Justin2k_ @warriors @cavs That's going to be a great matchup also
LBJ 🆚Durant, Kyrie 🆚Steph,         Love🆚Draymond, Klay🆚JR/Korver.  This @warriors 🆚 @cavs series is going to be epic.  #NBAFinals2017
@seanacierno I usually have an answer for you but this series is going to be epic.  Could go either way based on series momentum.
Chaaaaaaaaamp!  James Jones congrats on your 7th #NBAFinals appearance. https://t.co/bHUZqdV05v
@seanacierno History is in the making.
@seanacierno Amazing accomplishment.

I am so happy for you @TheRealJRSmith.  You have an amazing family and by the way you had a great game tonight.  #Dakota https://t.co/bNH8BSFOef
.@KyrieIrving was straight nasty w/ an incredible performance tonight. You have to give the @celtics credit for a gritty performance.
@TimBrando Have fun watching The Voice, you are missing some impressive performances.  @celtics are playing with a lot of grit.
That was some nasty work in the post by @KingJames.
Are you kidding me @KyrieIrving.  Straight going to work!!!! #NBAPlayoffs2017
My man @KyrieIrving is showing a ton of guts right now getting up from that ankle turn.  #NBAPlayoffs2017
You have to give the @celtics credit for making this a physical game.  They are "mucking it up" and it is having an affect on the @cavs.
.@spurs look like they are about to check out.  I think it would of been a competitive series if Leonard would of played.
@tglide42 @KDTrey5 @KingJames The King ran him down from 94' also.  Both superstars making extraordinary hustle plays to win championships.
This is the type of effort needed to win championships.  @KDTrey5 with a play similar to last year's #NBAFinals play of @KingJames. https://t.co/k7bmdtrluv
@scaravanajr Have to give credit to the @celtics for their never give up mindset.
@fortdanny Ya I thought it would be a sweep.  Have to give credit to the @celtics.  The @Cavs got up 21 and they took their foot off the gas pedal.
That's why we play the games.  What a gutty performance by the @celtics. #NBAPlayoffs2017
Unbelievable effort by the @celtics.  The @Cavs got too comfortable and it has set us up for a great finish.  #NBAPlayoffs2017
People want to talk about offense in today's @nba but defense still wins championships.  Both the @warriors and @cavs guard.
We are setting ourselves up for an epic showdown in the NBA Finals.
.@cavs are too big and too good.  This series is going to be a sweep. #NBAPlayoffs2017

Amazing camp experience.  Thanks @Shaq &amp; friends for having me!   https://t.co/8KtmtYB50J
Draft night was my favorite @OrlandoMagic memory.  Thanks for time and development to help me w/ long @NBA career.  https://t.co/ZEWTPPlXu4
Good luck to all draftees tonight.  Draft night was a dream come true.  #NBADraft2016 #TheFraternity https://t.co/OjK44nSi4V
Good luck to @OneBigHaitian today.  Watched kid grow up on @M33MHoops squad.#NBADraft #DreamsComeTrue #TheFraternity https://t.co/83I6tidHX7
Excited to be a part of great event w/ great coaches and of course The Diesel @SHAQ.  https://t.co/bWHNmiPSlM
This is what makes him the 👑.  Brought the championship home for #TheLand.  https://t.co/UxqRoQwdRb
Proud of my guy @TheRealJRSmith.  Start of the second half down 8 and bangs two 3s.   Proud of you bro.  Welcome to champions club. 🔥🔥
Defense wins championships. @warriors didn't score a point the last 4 minutes and 40 secs. The 👑's block was legendary.
Great late stop by @kevinlove on switch on @StephenCurry30.  Stayed down, tough, &amp; disciplined.
Should be shared #MVP.  @KingJames &amp; @KyrieIrving.  Kyrie became special over the #2016NBAPlayoffs &amp; the 👑 is the 👑.
.@KingJames has no killer instinct?    https://t.co/cCOzTevhiQ
What an amazing series for @warriors &amp; @cavs. Congrats to both teams &amp; players on representing the game right.   Congrats to #TheLand champs
Down 3-1 in series but knew it could happen with @KingJames, @KyrieIrving, and rest of @Cavs.  Triple double 🦁👑🏀=🐐 https://t.co/drI0xuQ8My
One of the most amazing defensive plays in #NBAFinals history by the 👑.
The magnitude of the moment has set in for both teams.  @warriors lacking their signature player and ball movement.Players are playing tight
The 👑 needs to take over now.
What a game.  What a series.  @warriors up 76-75 going into the 4th quarter.  #NBAFinals #Game7 #1MoreQuarter
The evolution of @KyrieIrving.  Taking over the game right now.
.@TheRealJRSmith giving the @Cavs the much needed spark.  Tie game. #NBAFinals
.@warriors 10-21 from 3, @cavs 1-14 from 3.   The 3pt fg is a deadly weapon in the @NBA
For @Cavs someone else besides @KingJames &amp; @KyrieIrving will need to give the @Cavs a significant contribution for them to win the title.
.@nba I love this game.  #NBAFinals #DubNation #ALLin216 #Game7 https://t.co/OzGl5gEjeR
Excited for Game 7 of #NBAFinals.   No better sporting event in the world than a game 7!   Who do you have winning?
Happy Father's Day to all Fathers! This was an amazing memory shared w/ my dad after Championship #2 w/ @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/yruLymZNnz
.@KingJames last two games, 82 points, 24 rebounds, 18 assists, 7 steals, 6 blocks, 3 turnovers, +37 plus/minus. 🦁👑
Never can doubt a heart of a 🦁.  Game 7 of #NBAFinals will be an epic one.
@Mattvjohnson yes I did.  Game 7 going to be epic.
Here we go Game 7 of #NBAFinals.  What an amazing performance be @KingJames. #witness
🦁👑🏀=🐐
🦁👑🏀
Got to love @KlayThompson &amp; @StephenCurry30 they can heat up in a hurry🔥🔥🔥💦💦💦
The #LION is out tonight.  @KingJames #GOAT
.@KyrieIrving last 6 quarters: 61 points, 23/36 (63.8%). Playing like an #MVP of the #NBAFinals
.@KingJames &amp; @KyrieIrving playing a lot like game 5 of #NBAFinals.   Straight domination! This series going 7 games https://t.co/outydYmIid
Loved hanging out with my @OrlandoMagic teammates @realgranthill33 &amp; @Real_T_Mac tonight at #NBAFinals #legends https://t.co/HsgK4HS2vu

Awesome to be apart of an amazing weekend with Coach Bob Knight one of the greatest minds in our sport. https://t.co/ZM986JnSfk
.@KingJames is the #GOAT &amp; @KyrieIrving is a special PG.  @Cavs are not done in this series.
Here we go!! Who's going to make the 4th quarter plays to win this pivotal game 4? My guess a role player will do the unexpected!#NBAFinals
Maybe one of the greatest National Anthems I have seen.  If this is any indication for Game 4 of the #NBAFinals we are in for a treat!
Ali was a historic figure who created social change &amp; left an amazing foot print on the world. #RIPMuhammadAli- THE CHAMPION OF THE WORLD
@ultirod @cavs.  The Cavs need more ball and player movement.  And ironically I would make splash bros beat you by carrying the load
Adjustments will have to be made.  Game 2 will be critical for the @Cavs if they want to bring a championship to #TheLand.  #NBAFinals
A lot of attention is paid to the stars but the role players define a series.@warriors are getting great production from others. #NBAFinals
Who's going to make the plays to win this important Game 1. My gut tells me a role player will make a play tonight that will tilt the series
Looking forward to this epic battle!   https://t.co/Eb3WTKrcqn
Great series w/ awesome performances by both teams.  #NBAFinals here we come @Cavs &amp; @warriors will be classic. https://t.co/QxTWp64W1j
