On average, state and local governments collect $1,518 per person in property taxes. That's why the new $10k limit on SALT deductions is reasonable/fair.   Unfortunately, politicians in some states/cities brutally tax their workers, #biz. #NoMoreHiddenTaxes https://t.co/PUy3y4d87Q
This drives higher wages for workers &amp; more economic oomph for U.S.  When local businesses invest tax free in the technology/equipment/buildings that make their workers more productive, paychecks go up.  That's why "full and immediate expensing" shld be permanent.  #GrowAmerica https://t.co/Eau0Vv43jr

The spending bill is certainly a first step towards securing our nation’s border, but I believe Congress should do more to seriously address this national security crisis. Click below for my full statement.

CLAIM: Lower tax refunds = higher taxes. FACTS:  - Tax refund has ZERO to do with your overall tax bill. - Refunds are a sign you're overpaying the IRS monthly.  - Most Americans got tax cut in 2018 paychecks - when needed the most. - 90% of middle class got $2,100 ave. tax cut https://t.co/NMMmIksdvK

.@SpeakerPelosi &amp; #Shumer should find common ground with @realDonaldTrump to address border crisis &amp; reopen govt.   IRS:  - Tax refunds will go out regardless. - Employees will answer phone tax filing ?'s. - Taxpayers should file as normal. - IRS has 2 yrs of $$ for new tax law. https://t.co/YERJWd0bZT
U.S. MANUFACTURING IS BACK.  - Best year of job growth since 1990s. - Blue-collar wage growth exceeds white-collar wage growth for first time in nearly a decade.  - Manufacturing jobs during @realDonaldTrump  grew 8 times faster than Obama's last 2 yrs.   https://t.co/8CfKqbGrmv
.@realDonaldTrump reflecting the concerns of the nation that U.S. has a crisis on the southern border.  In the Houston region &amp; TX we know the price in lives lost from drug &amp; sex trafficking, MS-13 gangs &amp; violent criminals who pass through our southern border. #FindCommonGround https://t.co/ppy5ex4Mfj
Our southern border is NOT secure and the Houston area and communities I represent pay the price -- MS-13 gang violence, sex trafficking, drug trafficking.  @realDonaldTrump is right. The crisis is real. Time to #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/WbHGotEgSM

JOBS REPORT FAR EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS.  - 312,000 new jobs added in December. - Unemployment rate ticks up as 419,000 more Americans started searching for work. - Wages up 3.2% from year ago - best year/year increase in a decade.  - U.S. economy remains strong. #GOPTaxCuts https://t.co/KCnc6X8NHv
GENTLE REMINDER - 2 weeks ago GOP House passed bill to fully fund gov't, build wall &amp; $8.7 billion in crucial disaster aid for CA wildfires, hurricanes/severe storms. Yesterday's "show vote" accomplished nothing, helped no one.      #WorkTogether   https://t.co/rSwX7j6zIF

Missing facts:  1) New tax law INCREASES % of $$ contributions deductible,  2) With xtra $2k, more jobs &amp; higher wages, families can give more,  3) Stronger economy = more contributions. 2008 fell 2%, 2009 fell 3.7%, took 5 yrs to recover to ‘07 levels. https://t.co/DGk9hNjVP1

UPDATE: Democrats Are Going to Try to Raise the Corporate Tax Rate.  Forcing more U.S. jobs overseas &amp; killing booming economy.  Factcheck: 3 of 4 $$$ in tax reform goes to individuals, not corporations. #BadIdea https://t.co/Ac0688Qj8I

https://t.co/53bhVQmyqU Making tax cuts permanent for families &amp; #SmallBiz, helping families #SaveMore &amp; spurring more start-up businesses in America. That’s 2.0.
TRUTH: What does the #Democrats government-run health care, ‘Medicare for all’ look like?  ⚠️  Bans health care plans at work ⚠️  Slashes payments to doctors &amp; hospitals ⚠️  Doubles all family &amp; business taxes  ⚠️  Price controls &amp; long waits ⚠️  Puts Washington in control

TRUTH: Out-of-pocket health costs are soaring since ACA. Tax Reform 2.0 makes it easier for Americans to deduct from their taxes high medical costs. Crucial for millions of seniors/families.    ❌ All but 3 House Democrats OPPOSED expanding the medical expense deduction.

https://t.co/9zOl1ID8uM It’s no wonder the poorly written ACA is back in court. But let’s be clear - the GOP passed House replace bill PROTECTS pre-existing conditions, kids staying on plans until 26 &amp; no lifetime limits. AND lowered costs by 20%. #PatientsFirst #StopScaring

This is about giving families more affordable health care choices. Americans should have the ability to save and spend their health care dollars the way they want and need.
“That one indicator alone shows how well the economy is doing,” Hegar --&gt; said.https://t.co/xnsczWEeJx
Proud doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel about my Director of Casework, Janet Qureshi, receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from @congressfdn. Janet has a heart of gold and I would not be where I am today without her.      Thanks for dropping by, @SpeakerRyan! https://t.co/PkIVPPZaF3
America really is stronger than ever. #BetterOffNow https://t.co/sMBvrxmhLK
New hires are at a 17-year high and 600,000 Americans are returning to the job market. Talk about proof that our economy is stronger than ever! Especially since for the first time in a long time, there are enough jobs for these workers.
President @realDonaldTrump made a very strong choice in Judge Brett Kavanaugh for #SCOTUS. Kavanaugh is a well-respected, pro-life justice that believes in the #RuleOfLaw and upholding the constitution. Read my full statement ➡️ https://t.co/im7IWOPYQI https://t.co/NdQJ0oOkvl
We have gone from a nation that asks ‘where are the jobs?’ to one that asks ‘where are the workers?' Great news to see so many Americans rejoin the labor market. https://t.co/5bTBs9krVS
What a blessing it is to be an American, especially during a time when liberty and prosperity for all is again on the rise. Have a safe and #Happy4thofJuly folks. May God continue to bless our great nation! https://t.co/bXXSok0VYa
Wages for families are growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Consumer confidence is through the roof. Texas businesses are roaring back, expanding and growing like never before. America is back, our economy is reflecting that. #TaxReform https://t.co/ActlC3EZjK
It was great to have Gracie, junior from @newcaneyisd, and her family up in Washington this week for the Congressional Art Winners reception. Gracie's piece, "The Anthem", captures the spirit of the Lone Star State so well and lights up the Capitol hallways! https://t.co/L6HIggjMqD

UPDATE: I voted to stand with President @realDonaldTrump in his call to build #TheWall, end visa loopholes, and protect children. Today, Democrats abandoned Dreamers, proving that their rhetoric is nothing but a political ploy. FULL STATEMENT ➡️ https://t.co/aMctjWCpfj

Exciting news for the vast majority of Americans --&gt;  https://t.co/aHkcyMAc4S
Too many Americans have gone in for routine procedures and come out of the experience hooked on opioids. I was happy to be part of the bipartisan effort yesterday to combat the widespread #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/1cex7qe4J6
Proud to have been a part of the “largest opioid bill in recent history” to help combat the #OpioidCrisis. Like most Americans, I’ve seen firsthand the horrible effects of this epidemic. Good read from @CNBC 👇  https://t.co/aEskEripxW
Congrats to all of the members of W&amp;M on a job well done. Our bills passed this week as part of the historic push to combat the #opioidcrisis will make a real difference in the fight against the #CrisisNextDoor.
We took on another intern for #NationalTakeYourDogToWorkDay and Fin is definitely leading the pack! https://t.co/r1OnPWWv2R
Something big indeed. America is back! Read my op-ed in the @WSJ ⬇️  https://t.co/ldKww7DzTb
Encouraged by GOP discussion tonite on border security &amp; immigration reform.  All sides making good faith effort to find common ground. Trump supports. Democrats? Abandoned Dreamers. Voted ‘no’ on legal status. Playing politics. Dems want an issue, not a solution.
Prediction: Democrats will abandon Dreamers today. After Schumer Shutdown, delaying Harvey relief and protesting for Dreamers, Democrats will turn their backs on them with ‘no’ vote. Truth is revealed – it was all a political fraud. What do you think?
I’m voting to build the Wall, end catch &amp; release, limit chain migration and end visa lottery. DACA folks can stay 1) when Wall is built, 2) if they earn it – work, school or military service. No special path to citizenship.
June is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month and today is #TheLongestDay of the year. To show our support and promote awareness, Team Brady went purple. Also just happens to be #NationalSelfieDay! #EndAlz

Last night the House passed @RepMikeBishop's bipartisan #STOPact to help block opioids from flowing into our country through the international mail system. Mike has been a leader on W&amp;M in the fight to combat the #OpioidCrisis — we’re lucky to have him.
At the end of the day, it is more than a game -- it is a chance to set aside politics for a few hours and show the nation that more unites us than divides us. #FourOnTheField @SteveScalise @RepErikPaulsen @RepShimkus https://t.co/nZvlVcIE95

Eisenhower called the operation a crusade in which, “we will accept nothing less than full victory.” While the cost on D-Day was high, it allowed more than 150,000 soldiers to begin the march across Europe to defeat Hitler. We are forever grateful for the courage shown that day. https://t.co/6wSlglm3Mo
Can’t argue with the numbers. #TaxReform. https://t.co/i4po7cxc65
I appreciate my friend and colleague @RepCurbelo's work on #TANF and his commitment to achieving meaningful, bipartisan reform to our welfare system.
I appreciate @RepMikeBishop's work to stop drug traffickers from shipping dangerous synthetic opioids through the international mail system. His bipartisan legislation will hold the USPS to the same standard as private carriers &amp; help keep this poison out of our communities.
As a father and former @MDCPS board member, @RepCurbelo is protecting children who are vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. Glad to see @POTUS signed his #bipartisan Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act into law.
#TaxReform is working for Texas families and Texas businesses, and the results speak for themselves. Check out the great news we received tonight from Texas based utility company, @Quadvest @quadvestH2O:
ICYMI: great read from the @WSJ about how states led by Democrat Governors are benefiting from #TaxReform. The more the merrier!
PASSED: This year’s military funding bill, which I proudly voted for, helps fulfill President @realDonaldTrump's promise to Make America Strong Again by providing our troops the training, equipment, and support they need to be ready for any threat. #NDAA https://t.co/UD3SILPbEu
Congrats to my friend @RepErikPaulsen for his critical role in our mark-up last week on bills to combat the #opioidcrisis. Too often patients lack real knowledge on the negative effects of starting on opioids. Erik’s bill will help turn that around.
Building off pro-growth #TaxReform, this legislation which rolls back #DoddFrank, will help ensure that Main Street continues to see better opportunities, every day. See my full statement below:
Some great news you might have missed
I applaud President @realDonaldTrump and @HouseVetAffairs Chairman @DrPhilRoe for working so hard for the men and women who selflessly served our nation. #TX08 is home to many of our nation’s finest, and I am proud to support each of these bills in their honor. https://t.co/a5fApzaajP
I’d like say a big thank you to W&amp;M Health Subcomte Chairman @PeterRoskam for his strong leadership in the fight against the #opioidcrisis. At our mark-up last week, he led a bill to help arm providers with the necessary information and tools to combat opioid use.
Thank you to my friend @RepCurbelo for his leadership in a bipartisan effort to fix a real problem in the #opioidcrisis — prescriber education. His bill will help flip the script on how our providers see opioid prescribing in the face of this nationwide epidemic.
That feeling when the delivery you’ve been waiting for finally arrives. Can’t wait to hang them up! #congressionalartcompetition https://t.co/fLJgdTMTaz

ICYMI: I spoke to the notion that #TaxReform benefits are just "crumbs" earlier on @FoxBusiness with @TeamCavuto. Check it out ⬇️ https://t.co/3WpPa9dXPv
President @realDonaldTrump is right to withdraw from the #IranNuclearDeal. This naïve, dangerous deal threatens Israel and ensures Iran – the number one state sponsor of terror – has a path to a nuclear arsenal. My full statement below:
Our economy is thriving thanks to #TaxReform. There are now 6.6 million job openings – a record high. And we're just getting started. https://t.co/vof0yirmu7
There is no denying it, Washington has a spending problem. I support President @realDonaldTrump's decision to cut wasteful government programs and roll back over $15 billion in spending.
ICYMI: I took to local airwaves back home in #TX08 and talked about the biggest and boldest step we've taken in 20 years to redesign the IRS. #TaxpayerFirst

This bill has good parts and bad, but in times like this you either stand with President @realDonaldTrump and our U.S. military or you don’t. I chose to vote ‘yes’ to rebuild America’s depleted military at a time when the world is more dangerous than ever. https://t.co/d8mF5AO4KR

Relieved Senate DEMS reversed course. Joining GOP to end #SchumerShutdown. Our troops, Harvey victims &amp; kids no longer held hostage. Shutdowns never good for the American people. Lets work together.  #ReasonPrevails https://t.co/PRv3FNv2K2
21,950 children in our congressional district harmed by #SchumerShutdown. Funding running out for TX kids. Democrats blocking CHIP renewal in shutdown. Regardless of UR view of DACA,  is that more important than health care for 21,000 local children and pregnant women? https://t.co/WWY8Bk2bAr
#SchumerShutdown hurting Hurricane Harvey victims in our community. Delaying critical help. Regardless of your view, is unrelated DACA more important than thousands of Harvey families and victims? Open the government, Sen. Schumer.  #WrongPriorities  #StopHurtingHarveyVictims https://t.co/0vdH2CAtbB
Our children, our veterans, and those serving our country in uniform - many in harm's way - deserve better. @SenSchumer and @SenateDems... open the government. https://t.co/kmZ2O8E4ES

Senate Dems vote to ‘shut ‘er down’ as promised. Cheer turning backs on military, children’s health care and U.S. jobs. Expect more political stunts. #Shameful #ShumerShutdown #HurtAmerica

Texas Democrats vote to shut down government, delay important Harvey relief aid that Texans need now, and stop healthcare for children. But find time for impeaching @POTUS? #PrioritiesWrong https://t.co/S7kx5EX97Z
I’m hopeful and expect to see more announcements of this type in the future.  https://t.co/EnQQLR6diS
Our troops and the millions of children who rely on CHIP don't deserve to suffer because of partisan politics.   I hope Senate Democrats think long and hard about the damage they will do to our country by shutting the government down.

Happy New Year! Today marks the beginning of a new tax code built specifically to deliver more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks to Texans and Americans nationwide. https://t.co/rx2ga1Y3TD
With lower tax rates at all income levels, Americans in every community will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money to save or spend as they see fit. In fact, a family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will save over $2,000. https://t.co/aWgbO8FU6P
Doubling the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 will help more parents across the country with the costs of raising a family and caring for loved ones. https://t.co/CHiBkOJUVJ

After years of stagnant wages, this new tax code will finally help Americans get a raise. It will reward hard work and encourage investment in our communities to increase the growth of jobs, productivity, and paychecks for hardworking Americans nationwide. https://t.co/ZGzJKAXdUF
Not only will our new tax code protect American workers and stop jobs from moving overseas – it will help reestablish our nation as a 21st century magnet for job creation, innovation, and economic growth. #NewTaxCodeCountdown https://t.co/huuFIZ6pz7
Americans will continue to have important tax benefits &amp; deductions they count on, including relief for high medical bills, mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and education expenses. Our new tax code also retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and IRAs. https://t.co/L72VQTNsgK
Preserving and expanding the charitable deduction will continue to encourage and reward Americans who give back to their local church, charity, or other cause they believe in. https://t.co/j6oMuuviSU
Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas. God Bless! https://t.co/cW4Ifo8QKJ
Main Street job creators will see historic new tax relief to help them succeed and grow. This includes a first-ever small business tax deduction of 20% that will save our job creators money so they can create more jobs and increase paychecks. https://t.co/InqKCgp3f2
American businesses large and small will have the lowest tax rates in modern history, allowing them to keep more money to grow and create new jobs. According to estimates from the Tax Foundation, this new tax code will help create nearly 340,000 full-time jobs over the long term. https://t.co/dnsa6zuG5y
