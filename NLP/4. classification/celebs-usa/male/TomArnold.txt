@mrspanstreppon @DerWouter @itschriswagner @hellomisswagner @jimtroush this is why Nancy Tellem got brought into the office of CEO at MGM last wk. To over see Mark Burnett. Why is MGM losing money when he personally is making so much &amp; flying to Syria so often. Burnett made $22mil for inauguration. Has made $350 mill with Trump. Burnett is the devil
@mrspanstreppon @DerWouter looks to be correct good work
@DebraMessing Remember when Mark Burnett threatened to sue you &amp; me if we said he got $ for Trump Inauguration? @emilyjanefox Mark Burnett got $22 million &amp; he asked Tom Barrack to set meetings for Putin‚Äôs oligarch buds with Donald Trump to gain influence for Russia. Not America

@RealJamesWoods James Woods may want to reconsider his choice to celebrate 2019 Black History Month by getting shit faced drunk alone in his rented room &amp; harassing black American heroes late at night on Twitter.....
@CherylFullner @realDonaldTrump @MarkBurnettTV does your family know you're nuts?
@RealJamesWoods You ever think about all those hot ladies you banged &amp; never spoke to again back in your heyday? Jesus Christ Woods. You were a fucking stallion. You were pretty awful to some of those women though. Is that what this is about because this doesn't heal anyone. Direct amends might.
@RealJamesWoods @GovernorVA Coonman? No. He's all yours now too Jimmy
@RealJamesWoods Michael Moore is all yours now Jimmy.

@realDonaldTrump Why‚Äôd you have @MarkBurnettTV fly into Syria 3 times (see MGM flight manifests 2017) to negotiate US troop withdrawal when Burnett is Putin‚Äôs pal?

False premise. She didn't curse him out. To curse someone out they must be present. Her curse wasn't even directed at Trump. It was a story about what she thought of him and what they would do to him. So no apology necessary dude. https://t.co/ETEGPkMbgE

Mark Burnett is an immigrant who worked in US illegally. He produced The Apprentice &amp; edited Trump to appear competent.

So did Mark Burnett. Now i have horrible fu. One of Burnett‚Äôs Russian  buds slipped me some polonium 210 when Mark choked me at Nite Before Emmy  Party. Also coulda got flu at kids pre school. I think Burnett poisoned me. Or both. Probably Both. Probably Roma. And Trump https://t.co/1S3wiSWjYe

Adivan/lorazepam is in class of drug known as benzos (benzodiazepines) They can be very addictive &amp; hard to detox off. That's why I went to Crossroads Treatment Facility in Antigua 20 months ago.

@caymanisland75 @PattyOLimerick @realDonaldTrump Never under estimate the goodness, dignity &amp; steely resolve of the American people nor the cowardice &amp; complete lack pistol discipline of crazy shaky Donald Trump.

@jason_howerton And you can call bullshit. Nothing is more American than calling bullshit.
@jason_howerton They are progressive but intolerant of hypocrisy &amp; seriously it is getting absurd. Blacks for Trump. Gays for Trump. Trans for Trump. Fiscally Responsible Spenders for Trump.

@TK9582 @richards_jc We hit that joke pretty hard in the film of course:)
@robbystarbuck @NateSilver538 Don‚Äôt over do it bud. Read the #QAnon  posts about her. Or the #NRA posts. These are MAGAt men &amp; they are obsessed.

@michaeljknowles any chance Michael Cohen blackmailed you into supporting Trump because your business/sex relationship with a 21 year old pool boy got crazy like Jerry Falwell Jr?
Remember when I said he had to call 911 after being choked out during weird sex? https://t.co/G5rTpf5Ahs
@TheRickWilson On the other hand @GeorgePapa19 is free!
@patmiletich You support people who do. You support fake conspiracies that have been proven false &amp; put women's lives at risk. Q isn't real. #TheStormIsNotComing #QAnon #QArmy use this as excuse to threaten women's lives. You guys call them socialists so they are "a threat to the republic".
@JamisonMoeckel Censorship's bad but search my name. The right seems pretty damn uncensored if you ask me. As for Sargon. Who the fuck is Sargon &amp; how did Sargon make his money? I care about Calgon. Take me away, Calgon. It's bubble bath from the 80's. Lets talk football!!! See end of Dolphins??

@ScottMStedman Can't anyone be happy for anybody anymore??? Hahahahahahaha
@ScottMStedman He gave George a quote for the cover of his book dude!!
@patmiletich Alittle condescending from a guy who believes in the Q conspiracy which has more holes in it than Santa Claus, Easter Bunny &amp; The Tooth Fairy combined &amp; has given crazy people all over the world license to threaten &amp; bully women &amp; disregard facts allowing grifters to loot America

@AlexPogoBear @realDonaldTrump I'm not "making fun of someone". I'm talking about the president. He has snorted Adderall. He did it on the set of Celebrity Apprentice. Ivanka takes Adderall. I am also an expert in this genre. So considering his behavior I think it's a hell of a good question. No?

Anyone know what Don Jr‚Äôs been working on since midterms?  He was everywhere &amp; then nowhere. Eric‚Äôs been doing the Trump Family dirty work on Fox News but ‚Äúrising star Don Jr‚Äù is a ghost. A ghost who got caught lying for his dad. A warm bunk in Fed Prison is opening up in 79 mins
Trump is freaking out because he knows the First Family is about to experience Robert Mueller‚Äôs family separation policy.

Exactly! &amp; that goes both ways. Whichever way @simonamangiante goes &amp; @GeorgePapa19 ends up going. Who knows? Who cares?

@gehrig38 @KathrynMur1959 @nocrackers30 Curt, those weren't Trump's recent tax returns &amp; you know it. That's bullshit. He's hiding them because he's not as rich as he says.

@jason_howerton Don't worry brother. He'll need something else. You'll get to wipe his butt until he's 5. I'm pretty sure Jax knows how to wipe his own ass but he knows it warms dad's heart to hear him him in the potty yelling "Daddy, I need you in here"
@simonamangiante nice seeing you tonite. You‚Äôre an amazing wife &amp; friend. @GeorgePapa19 will be so grateful when he walks out of prison &amp; you‚Äôre still there.

@mrpford @Lrihendry Red herring. Apples oranges. Kid f-Ed up. He‚Äôs a man. He knows it. It‚Äôs a fricking parade not his job dude. Why are Republicans such pussies? Always the victim. The abused white man or here. Joy invited Kid on her show. It‚Äôs over
@JuddApatow He did not serve 18 months. Or 8 months. Donald Trump asked Epstein for a huge bailout loan after he got out of prison because Donald Trump was broke in 2009 &amp; he was very friendly with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Another reason Pelosi gets his taxes. Ask Dershowitz now.
@mrpford @Lrihendry Its a parade. A public event. Not a professional job. Children attend. It‚Äôs for families They are instead honoring a man who saved a bunch of peoples lives in Nashville. He‚Äôs black. Was a chef at Waffle House. But by means boycott Nashville for the real victims: White Republicans
@DLoesch @JimWelc61874359 @mindbender63 Imagine the hired face of a racist criminally corrupted organization responsible for ensuring weapons of war are easy to access for school massacres falsely crying sexism &amp; playing the victim card everytime she‚Äôs asked to defend @NRA actions?

Donald Trump's racism emboldened the underbelly of racist America that's always been. I remember members of the media sitting in stunned silence when I first called Trump a racist 2 yrs ago.

@KroegerCurt @talionis_l @NRA What if you're a good black guy with a gun &amp; you display your gun at a mall in Alabama to stop a crime? This kinda thing happens a lot. @NRA never comments on good black guys with guns getting killed by cops. It's weird, right?
@talionis_l @NRA My family back in Iowa loves guns too &amp; so far they've only shot themselves &amp; their mobile homes. I am dead serious.
YOU believe a lot of things that aren't true. I beat up "Arnie" in movie Nine Months. No way Chris Columbus could clear a guy in a big purple suit at toy store Hugh Grant &amp; me were shopping in named "Barney" See, I do matter!

@GoldstoneRob @kathygriffin Last how‚Äôs the book doing? I love my copy. So funny. I would‚Äôve chimed in on KATHY but didn‚Äôt want the men in black back over here. By the way your trump tower meeting is in the news. You going to prison old chap?

@BothelSmith @DLoesch @NRA Oh boy. Dare I say I have a tape of it? Help me lord. That's why I know it happened. I'm not a listener of her crap show &amp; neither are you apparently but if she mentions me in a libelous way lawyers from both of our Corps know. Call me anything. Don't lie about what I call you.
@USA_Aquanaut @cowellp @ChrisLoesch @fantasyfbdriven @Conserv08481241 @katiet121 @NumberOne_Four @NRA @DLoesch Put your teeth in &amp; try eating an apple grandpa. Doctors say that cures a bunch of stuff too &amp; settle the hell down or I'm taking the batteries out of the remote control.
@DLoesch you lied again last night on your radio show about me talking about your sex life &amp; calling you inappropriate sexual names like a b-word. Never happened. Once again you try to make yourself the victim when the real victims die of gun violence &amp; culture you &amp; @NRA promote
@robdelaney They will Robby!!!!
@jimgeraghty @benshapiro Probably. If not overtly subconscious for sure.
@ivanka @AndreaChalupa @keith_pochick @IvankaTrump I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@talter @ShutUpAmanda damn you're funny I bet Guy Slattery hated you
@AndreaChalupa @keith_pochick Where's all the art @Ivanka and Jared got from Russian's for wedding gifts? Used to see pictures of it. Now it's in Switzerland? I know you have a lot of your plate. A big art dealer cheated on his wife &amp; hid their art in the same place. The ex-wife knows now. She has receipts.
@emilyjanefox I'll say it again kiddo..you are the real hero advocate for women...ugh..you're a saint
@KrexPershing @abrassive0193 @douglaskarr @katiet121 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand @realDonaldTrump Send us a video of you doing anything. Brushing your teeth? I want to see what your life is really like. Where you live &amp; work. Who you really are. I bet money you are not your twitter bio. Let's get to know the real you since you know so much about me. Don't be afraid young man.
@ChrisLoesch @fantasyfbdriven @Conserv08481241 @katiet121 @NumberOne_Four @NRA @DLoesch You are a ghoul @ChrisLoesch who cares more about sucking up to @NRA than helping save lives of future mass shooting or suicide victims. Other parents will bury children because of lies, red herrings &amp; boogie men your family Trump &amp; NRA perpetuated on frightened naive Americans.
I‚Äôll believe @NRA really cares about gun safety when they make a video called ‚ÄúHow to Spot a Good Black Guy with a Gun‚Äù &amp; send it to every Police Department in America. @DLoesch https://t.co/qIzvVnPNP4
Donald Trump is going to be so mad when he hears this! #QAnons https://t.co/MOes5LVBOc
@DLoesch TY for confirming everything I said is correct @DLoesch @realDonaldTrump reversed an Obama order to help Vets. 22 Veterans commit suicide everyday. @NRA does nothing but fight us &amp; the families when we try to save these heroes. Like my nephew. Thanks for letting crazy me pack tho
@MikeThatsWho1 @abrassive0193 @douglaskarr @katiet121 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand @realDonaldTrump Ask gun store owner what he thinks about the gun show exemption. Ask a gun store owner how he feels about being a mental health professional now. My buddy Mike Sporer owns an Iowa gun store &amp; a dude comes in &amp; wants the cheapest shot gun &amp; one shell. True story. A lot of pressure

@katiet121 @NumberOne_Four @fantasyfbdriven @ChrisLoesch @NRA Not for nothing but I'm sorry men have been crappy to you. I'm sorry women have to protect themselves from men. You're right they do. Men are awful. As a rule this world is unsafe for women but men use guns on women 1000 times more often than women use them to defend themselves.
@katiet121 @NumberOne_Four @fantasyfbdriven @ChrisLoesch @NRA 10-4
@katiet121 @NumberOne_Four @fantasyfbdriven @ChrisLoesch @NRA Can you do something with involving your ears? Can you fly with them? That would be my first choice.
@katiet121 @NumberOne_Four @fantasyfbdriven @ChrisLoesch @NRA You ain't packing brain cells sister because that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously. You shouldn't sleep alone with your gun tonight. Call a friend. Okay just my 2 cents. Carry on.
@ezesgirl1 @jason_howerton @Schwarzenegger Robert Mueller's a Republican...there all better

@JamesCollins1 @DavidMa31663203 @ChrisLoesch @TACP_TICK Does it mention my Golden Globe or that I was MVP of Rock &amp; Jock 2 times!!!

@katiet121 @Pizo24 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand man @katiet121 you are really sucking up for @DLoesch job &amp; people don't even know @NRA is cutting ties with her yet. You're like Matt Whitaker to Jeff Sessions cold...damn girl...
@katiet121 @douglaskarr @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand that's Putin...
@douglaskarr @katiet121 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand I hate @NRA leadership. They are the one's who spend YOUR hard earned money making sure mentally unstable folks have the right to carry gun show AR-15's into First Grade classrooms &amp; blow kids heads off so they can scare YOU into buying more guns &amp; defending THEM against ME.
@secupp Trump did not read the Climate change report of course. Wish someone would ask him specifics about it. Donald Trump doesn't read reports. Trump has never read the Constitution, Bible, any bill or contract. He never read the Iran Deal or the Paris Agreement. Ask him Q's... https://t.co/8Xwwp1TOHI
@katiet121 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand educate me. Sandy Hook.too. I grew up in Iowa with guns &amp; understand them &amp; gun safety. @NRA is a trade group repping gun industry. Entire reason for existence is to sell as many guns as possible. I am a human father. My job is to protect my kids. Back off.
@Ellelque @ChrisLoesch Wait..she married her dad too? OMG no wonder @DLoesch is a monster. ..WTF @NRA @ChrisLoesch you‚Äôve got some explaining to do to the American people!!! Does @realDonaldTrump know? Wait..probably his idea..wink wink..
@LifeZette @SecretService Now do @realDonaldTrump 5 worst tweets &amp; retweets &amp; lies about each person #magabomber sent a pipe bomb to via US mail including the attempted assassinations of 2 US Presidents last month. Then do Don Jr‚Äôs tweets. You know I never threatened a child @LifeZette @SecretService @CNN
@ChrisLoesch Your wife works for a terrorist organization that is responsible for for children getting slaughtered at school. Nobody‚Äôs perfect.
Don't blame Secret Service.They were doing their job. We discussed the irony they were sitting in my Beverly Hills living room while #MAGABomber was still loose in Florida. Of course Cesar Sayoc was inspired by Trump at his rallies. Secret Service warned Trump but kept doing it. https://t.co/GnVMPxLI1C
@Dijzeltweet @Chris6375 @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette That is not true but what is truth is a dead broke Donald Trump went to his long time friend Jeffery Epstein for a many million dollar bail out loan after Epstein went to prison for pedophilia in 2008. This just one reason it‚Äôs important Democrat‚Äôs subpoena Donald Trump‚Äôs  taxes.

@EndTimeHeadline @patmiletich Iowa beats Nebraska at the gun. Coach Ferentz headbutted the quarterback and former tough guy @patmiletich is retweeting EndTimeHeadlines because 2 rats boned &amp; got the herpes. How far the mighty have fallen to honor conspiracy coward in chief Donald Trump.
@jayrosen_nyu @The_Corres @sarahkendzior That easy huh? So then why aren't you coaching the @Giants? Serious question. We have to win out &amp; everyone else has to lose basically. Starting now so don't go back to sleep just yet.
@jayrosen_nyu @MalcolmNance @The_Corres Here's what happened. Someone thought it would be okay to drop @sarahkendzior work for some reason. It was not. Even on Thanksgiving. Usually a great media day to sneak crappy things through Sarah has two many loyal fans. Also she will burn you down herself. Read her work. dude.

@RauschB Don't worry about him now take care of yourself &amp; your family. By being open &amp; honest is you've not only exposed this bad guy but this sub culture of true crime fans who are vulnerable to conmen, manipulators &amp; worse. This guy is a text book predator. I'm honored to help a friend
@simonamangiante It's amazing story. The story very few know (behind-behind the scenes:) make your story crazy amazing and your father will be so very proud.

@RealDeanCain @pridegrinn You couldn't carry her cape.
@GeorgePapa19 @maggieNYT All will be exposed buddy.

@Patrick13487505 @staceydash @realDonaldTrump Yeah, don't want to incite another 9/11 defending a journalist by the people who did 9/11
Yes @staceydash your beloved @realDonaldTrump should start a war with Saudi Arabia. It would last 3 days. Long enough for him to finally visit the troops as they take all the oil to pay for the war like he criticized George W Bush for not doing in Iraq. Another promise kept.#MAGA https://t.co/G4zMFSYwEt
@siffdog Funny but this is an amazing edition of the Expendables That little Ethiopian dude on the left is an one of the worlds fastest ultra marathoner's. He can run 30 marathon's in 30 days. He's also a cop in real life but he's still the dead wood on our team. Best Expendables everüëäüëä

@fjw09080 @realjoecal @RealDeanCain @NRA man you saw, was he in Stallone or Schwarzenegger movie cause it's a million to one a human walks away from that. You know that unless you're a frigging idiot. People just don't walk away. Children never do. Cool story tho, bro. Shut your pie hole old man.Unless you want to help.
@fjw09080 @realjoecal @RealDeanCain @NRA Seen first graders take those rounds? Describe results to our friends who insist everyone needs to carry assault weapons around town. Do you agree there's a class of weapons designed for the battlefield &amp; not for home safety &amp; in the wrong hands lead to gruesome consequences?
@DGComedy @matange2 @SarahPalinUSA "Nalin Palin" still holds up tho. 10 years later. Timeless. Kid you not.
@MarkSpensley @andrewklavan @benshapiro @IvankaTrump is proud of her dad so that should tell you something low bar for pride in the father-daughter relationship.
@RebekahWorsham are you a dude?
@BradMarshv1 they also knew where these guys were going before they did
@BradMarshv1 That's why no one was supposed to know what happened.
@BradMarshv1 wouldn't tell fallen solders name cause nature of mission but 3 mths ago was watching jake tapper &amp; he honors fallen solder I saw pic &amp; he died around the time in the area I called my pentagon bud &amp; bingo. Wrote letter to his fam letting em know he was heroic &amp; well taken care of
@BradMarshv1 One died. Guess that would be easiest to prove. Saw the others up close in the temp med quarters. 10th Cavalry Feb 07

@banditelli They can be the same 400 pound fat guy dude
@realjoecal @RealDeanCain @NRA I was in Afghanistan 2007. The AR-15 is a weapon of war. Kills armored servicemen. I saw it with my own eyes. Each round leaves a lethal wound. Sandy Hook first graders had faces blown off. Assault weapons need to be banned. Never on our streets. The end. F-The NRA.
@AlfonZoRachel Pray you‚Äôre a bot otherwise you are a waste as a. Bots spew that exact dialogue as NRA/White Supremacist Evangelical talking points for Trump, gun manufacturers &amp; GOP voters. Actual children die because they‚Äôve made you hate science &amp; stupid. It‚Äôs a cult. You‚Äôre a sucker.#Monster
@patmiletich Sorry....Pat Miletich blows Trump too.....fell better I didn't leave you out buddy?
@missamityisland @jstidham1 @RealDeanCain @PaulStewartII @NRA Your wish came true because it is exactly that simple now.
@missamityisland @jstidham1 @RealDeanCain @PaulStewartII @NRA Dean Cain shames men &amp; women who have the courage to stand up to the NRA. Some have lost family members. More of us will because of people like Dean Cain supporting NRA unconditionally so yes Dean Cain is officially a monster. He can‚Äôt hide beside his S anymore.Hes one of them.
@gldstwmn Always
@not_azrael78 @RealDeanCain I stood up to Trump &amp; the NRA. I‚Äôm not a cultist like Dean who attacks good people for both monsters but never has the courage to disagree or make a public stand against them. Dean says he‚Äôs many things but he does not back it up ever. Needs ‚Äúmore research‚Äù ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt seen the news‚Äù
@andrewklavan @benshapiro Look who‚Äôs talking. She‚Äôs blown 1000 men. You only blow Trump.
Can this be the final straw Mark Burnett? Kevin Ulrich? Ari Emanuel? Haim Saban? Rupert, Lachlan, James Murdoch? None of you have said one public word against anything Donald Trump has done. He is destroying my children's planet &amp; about to start a war so he can visit his troops. https://t.co/B4Hgkn1fQ4

@dogsrockbehappy @loribahr7 @SecretService @POTUS Hahaha my taxes paid. My point proven. When you stand up to Donald Trump you get extra attention from his idiot trolls, IRS &amp; Secret Service but G-d bless America!
@TimmSusan @LindaFines @brianstelter Anyone that's donated blood one time has been more selfless than Donald Trump has in his entire life.
1. I visited troops in a war zones. 2. Paid taxes. 3. Stood up to Donald Trump in-spite of personal, professional &amp; financial threats. 4. Unlike Donald Trump. I respected what Secret Service told me about inciting violence. 5. Don't tell lies using @SecretService to cover my ass. https://t.co/LRuXRmKyQN

@emilyjanefox Boy we have about 600 sins..is being complicit to treason listed in the Torah or did Jared get "blanket permission" for that too? Was this from Mike Pence's Michigan rabbi? ‚ú°Ô∏è
@brianstelter and his hair...it rains like crazy in Afghanistan...ugly rain too..muddy as hell also..all over the loafers..not a good look. No sir. Also he has no idea where any of these war zones are so we could send him to the Universal back lot to visit the set of The Rock's new war movie..

@RealDeanCain @KimMarvyvans @UFC_RO @jack "Dad, did you ever speak up when Donald Trump was destroying our democracy &amp; the planet where we live?" "No way.

@RealDeanCain @KimMarvyvans @UFC_RO @jack You can say you finally stuck your neck out for something important for your country
@KimMarvyvans @UFC_RO @RealDeanCain @jack Dean seem like he had a hysterectomy
@KimMarvyvans @UFC_RO @RealDeanCain @jack Dean will be history minor when he runs into me next if he's a mouthy as he is on here. He won't be but if he were. I wonder if Trump even programed his hard drive to battle
@janetlgus @aby_rant @MarkBurnettTV @RepAdamSchiff they might push him into resigning because they are aweful

That's why I kept asking where P.K. was:)

@ComedyBrandyB @KristaMichaelsX @Schwarzenegger @ASASafterschool Not to put too fine a point on it but I'm 6'2"...whatever those guys say they are it's cool...just saying. This is my truth...If you ever get into couples counceling you'll hear that phrase a lot. "this is my truth" It's a couples counseling evergreen. I've heard it for decades.
@ComedyBrandyB @KristaMichaelsX @Schwarzenegger @ASASafterschool My insecurity forces me to point out you two are super tall &amp; super young but as I'm sure you recall I'm younger &amp; taller than Arnold &amp; Sly &amp; Jason Statham.

Mark cheated his own immigration &amp; took money under table. He could be deported by ICE if Trump didn‚Äôt cover it. They‚Äôre Trump White Nationalists
@_LOVEINVAIN @GeorgePapa19 @realDonaldTrump Is it possible to care too much?
@Ernstgregory2 @StormIsUponUs because Q is a joke &amp; you are stupid?
@CamilaCaBowYo @armiehammer @josiehunt_ yeah kudos because there are so many dicks on twitter who have the then add their incipit thoughts about the "proper way to grieve" confirming your original point

My rival Roger Stone bringing down bad guys with him? Seems like yesterday I was warning a bunch of them ‚ÄúAmerica or Trump?‚Äù Seemed like a easy choice to me but not Mark Burnett? David Pecker?

I believe police, this public defender &amp; what Secret Service told me to my face. Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump &amp; supporters lie &amp; embellish. About me too.

@RobbieGramer @thedailybeast Let's not fart around the bush any longer. It's time to cut to the cheese: Since becoming just another Donald Trump suck up Mike Pompeo has morphed into a 300 pound block of crappy processed cheese.Happy Veterans Day.
@andylassner He used to be the funniest comic from Denver. Not kidding. He started going over the edge a few years ago and I tried to help him. Doesn't make any sense. Roseanne looked up to him when she started working there. Actually it's starting to make a lot of sense. Carry on. You rock.

@sugarkiper @forthepatrie @benshapiro I'm 2nd worst. Ben's 3rd. Need a woman. Some experience. Only a man run's for President first time out. Gotta be a woman or we'll hear about man's frat party tricks "You ladies want a hot dog?" His penis is in the bun. This is a variation on "What time is it?" Penis on your wrist
@JohnKerry @OfficialJonZal Best weekend ever for veterans vs comedians. Happy Veterans Day indeed.
@RealDeanCain @jack When Trump does another horrible disgusting UnAmerican thing you'll puss out again &amp; say you haven't seen the news yet so you cannot comment. When the Trump Administration decided to erase trans people's identities from existence you said nothing but still claim you're pro-LGBTQ.
@codyave @Joestradamus91 @GTS_Watch @JarradKushner @actual_chaos @neecbf @ScottMStedman @abbydphillip I interviewed him at his home May 3 &amp; he told me they were meeting, sent me confirmation, another agent present &amp; we've stayed in touch

@benshapiro Speak for yourself, bitch!
@ComedyBrandyB You guys were the only people who‚Äôd talk to me about f-ing Trump...hahaha...:):) wondered what happened to you two characters. Best part of that deal. Arnold is the best tho &amp; After School All Stars rules but we need to hang kiddo. Denver comics love me:):):)

@RadioFreeTom @LeaBlackMiami There‚Äôs also a 1% chance in Trump‚Äôs own mind there‚Äôs a pee pee tape because the 1% of his mind that still functions correctly knows the host body is capable of anything.
@RadioFreeTom @LeaBlackMiami This is the truth
@jason_howerton Now all we can do is sit in our hotel room &amp; cry...damn you @jason_howerton
@stupid_hat Relax dude. I thought it was funny. Carry on:)
@bassgaljudy Unlike Donald Trump I‚Äôve been to Afghanistan &amp; Qatar &amp; Okinawa, Camp Pendleton etc  &amp; I have too much respect for Veterans to defend him today.
In Wash DC Dec 13 2000 Got invited to VP‚Äôs home. Tipper Gore was making grub for fam &amp; friends. Al Gore stood up ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.

@IsaacDovere ‚ÄúDonald Trump is the worst human being I‚Äôve ever met in my entire life‚Äù Executive Producer Celebrity Apprentice 2016. Before he took office. The guy who worked closest with Trump. You know the producer too @IsaacDovere write that story now before it‚Äôs too late. Trump can‚Äôt change
Donald Trump is such a huge coward he isn‚Äôt even going to visit the troops at the fake war zone he created at our border. #VeteransDay2018 #ArmisticeDay100 #CaliforniaWildfires

Deplorable $150 million political stunt @realDonaldTrump @GOP @FoxNews America loves, appreciates &amp; respects those who serve &amp; their families.

@MalcolmNance @SnowBiAuthor Give him a break dude. Trump watched that disney zombie high school cheerleader show Barron likes on Air Force One
@Blkgrlmgk1 @CapehartJ @DavidCornDC Tomorrow is 100th anniversay of signing the armistice ending First World War. Watch the History Channel‚Äôs WW1. No one stopped to watch Hannity or took breaks for Rush Limbaugh, Infowars or 6 Big Macs. They weren‚Äôt so fat they had to ride in Jazzie‚Äôs. There‚Äôll never be a race war.
@grantstern @ABC I know;) but there‚Äôs more buddy
@realDonaldTrump Bullsht
@GeraldoRivera Okay. You are the Attorney General!
@stupid_hat I‚Äôve heard this for 2 G-d damn years!
@JohnAHunt @mrctv No
@ABC Why???
@SydneCatherine Dude it‚Äôs not out yet
@phil_ebby He was never really in..is what Trump will say when he blames Sessions. It is Sessions fault for being a coward. How funny tho lil racist Jeff Sessions who‚Äôs scared to  death of black men &amp; brown peeps but gets humiliated for a year by big white boss man
@Writing_IsLife @bigmommamcg Too late
That was a brief tenure even by Trump administration standards. #MattWhitaker
@MaureenShaw @20SidedGeis ‚ù§Ô∏èüëä
@dontcha_know1 Tweets are forever dumbass #MuellerTime
‚ÄúGet it done.‚Äù Donald Trump took a direct role on numerous occasions in suppressing stories about his alleged sexual encounters with women. https://t.co/1YrpdC4VoG via @WSJ
@Monstorer @MJMcKean I‚Äôm saying he went to U of I law school with Mo‚Äôs brother Joe who grew up next door to your tweet buddy Yo
@4lisaguerrero @MJMcKean üî•üî•üî•üî•
@MJMcKean Guys it sounds like our buddy Matt Whitaker hates Jews or something. No one buys a hot tub from Matt until he explains, okay? I it‚Äôs time we tell the rest of the world Bible Boy got fired as corporate legal counsel at SuperValu Grocery for banging bosses wife in Minnesota, cool?
@MiraSorvino #StartUP is such a cool ass show it has the Sons Of Anarchy Guy @perlmutations already &amp; now you @MiraSorvino so it‚Äôs even cooler...You are an amazing human too. I‚Äôm in Canada thinking about our funny week #psych Congrats!!!!! #StartUP
@CapehartJ Secret Service warned The President of The United States several times. They carefully explained how his rhetoric &amp; behavior could incite violence. Donald Trump continues to ignore the US Secret Service &amp; risk journalists, US citizens &amp; Secret Service Agent‚Äôs lives. @DavidCornDC
@keithboykin If Matt Whitaker is ever present when Trump bullies a woman like that &amp; he doesn‚Äôt tackle Trump &amp; make him apologize to the woman Matt Whitaker might as well turn in his Hawkeye gear because he‚Äôs longer welcome back home in Iowa.
#MattWhitaker was Donald Trump‚Äôs Jeff Sessions snitch inside DOJ so he kinda did know Matt Whitaker. They spoke often.  Trump tweeted about Sessions after every call.
@thomasafine @cowboyarch @maddsurgeon @brianbeutler Sammy Donaldson!!!
@britneychienne @hate1977 He was a lawyer for corporate office in Minnesota
@41Derek41 @jenimanon @dudapop79 @esaagar @benshapiro @TuckerCarlson I don‚Äôt like it &amp; it‚Äôs at the very least stupid &amp; better never happen again
@pardekooper @SheriSalata @aplusk You had me at #BoRamsey congrats buddy! #IowaPride
@ezesgirl1 Iowa‚Äôs a small town. Matt went to U of Iowa law school with Mo‚Äôs brother Joe. He caught a touchdown in the Rose Bowl. We remember everything about guys who catch TD‚Äôs in Rose Bowls. He sold hot tubs in Vegas not that long ago but his SuperValu Grocery Corporate firing‚Äôs legendary
Did anyone work with Matt Whittaker at SuperValu Grocery Corporate HQ in MN? Love to chat.
@StephenAtHome I‚Äôm on a plane &amp; not exactly sure what happened but i know we always have to be the fucking good guys but not with Trump. Until he resigns. No actually fuck him even after he quits.
@realDonaldTrump So you make it easier for people with mental illness to get guns &amp; you won‚Äôt have comprehensive background checks or ban weapons of war like AR-15‚Äôs @NRA tells you no. STOP JACKING UP THE MILITARY PRIVATE BONE SPURS Unless you‚Äôre going to talk about their mental health aftercare.
@tarastrong @realDonaldTrump @NRA Yes. The @NRA owns @realDonaldTrump &amp; he‚Äôs a coward Incapable of change honesty or empathy. He has got to go before more people die. @GOP are also guilty of manslaughter. They serve @NRA &amp; gun lobby &amp; not the United States Citizens or the Constitution they took an oath to serve.
@ThomasG23478011 @ForUsNaturals @patmiletich Worked Fox Sports &amp; close to F News.

@michaeljknowles #MAGABomber is a domestic terrorist don‚Äôt sugar coat The fear &amp; resources he put this country through are terrible, ongoing &amp; general public will probably never know.

@timsylviamma Your worse nightmare Tim.  Sorry. Missed you first go round. Go Hawks
@JamesPidd @esaagar @benshapiro @TuckerCarlson It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm sure @TuckerCarlson knows as Secret Service explains if you go on TV &amp; say inflammatory things, even a joke, you can incite some mentally ill people (fans) to be violent. They‚Äôve warned Trump many times but he ignores his own Secret Service. Crazy dangerous, huh?
@mma_florida @patmiletich Hahaha...Not so sure..air quality in this van not so good..haven‚Äôt cracked a window since 1994
@morningrocker We‚Äôve got a rock solid back-up plan this time

@ImpossibleGrl11 @MattWhitaker46 Our new Atty General‚Äôs twitter feed should recuse itself

WTF ? @patmiletich Q weighed in on this? The caravan just disappeared? This is some Devil‚Äôs Triangle bullshit! Is @realDonaldTrump still playing 3-D Chess? Did caravan bring down international pedo ring &amp; arrest Obama &amp; Hillary with Mueller?  Soro‚Äôs cut off caravan credit cards? https://t.co/mLYEJJaFW9
@schpunglemonkey @patmiletich Billy Connelly has to be on that list. Steve Coogan. Especially Alan Partridge. We‚Äôre talking entire UK correct? So many. Peter Cook-Dudley Moore. Peter fucking Sellers, Sasha Barron Cohen,  Ricky Gervais
@lindamargaret54 @bjamieson Exit Wounds
@RteamZena @patmiletich You incharge of caravan update now? It was a simple request. That was a major threat to our sovereignty a couple days ago &amp; now that Democrats have the House I want to make sure we do the job so Pat &amp; Trump aren‚Äôt so frightened. Unless you‚Äôre telling me it was bullshit all along.
@gr8fuldaveb @ashleyfeinberg I always knew..was using it as leverage for Melania elevator tape

@LaurentRuseckas @digrigs66 @ladykayaker @Indictapalooza @kaitlancollins @LauraAJarrett @SethAbramson But Jared &amp; Ivanka‚Äôs hidden Russian wedding gift art. Check it out.
@kaitlancollins Yes &amp; said he wouldn't but I bet he will be forced to recuse if his past words &amp; deeds keep coming out. Matt's kind of a dip shit. That's why he's perfect Team Trump. Also why he'll be forced to recuse. Check his work in Iowa with Sam Clovis. We all take odd jobs when we're broke
@RealDeanCain Wow is right. Being a comedy narc is a thing? @AmiHorowitz
@funder Gotta respect Matt for wearing his Hawkeye helmet under his skin tho.
@patmiletich Been off twitter for 2  hrs &amp; need a caravan update. I can‚Äôt find anything &amp; it was all you &amp; Trump talked about before midterm. Did Trump‚Äôs Army stop them at the border in a hail of gunfire or did they murder their way to Bettendorf &amp; steal your job delivering Happy Joe‚Äôs Pizza?
@Yamiche It's bad when The Secret Service has to protect America from the guy inside the White House.
Want a personalized message from me, Tom Arnold?! Check out my profile on Cameo and help me put my kids through grade school https://t.co/GKEmlj1f3F
@realDonaldTrump Good choice. I have seen him naked. He's got a beautiful body. He's also an incredible suck up. Let me know if there are any other qualifications you require for this job.
@dorotheascloset @KileNorby Most Iowans are great. Most didn't vote for Steve King. He's been exposed now so he lost, we win &amp; his days are numbered. Also Twitter doesn't always should the sublime subtlety of my Tweets. My first on a person might be to send a message to THEM just to have it on the record.
@HillTVLive Trump hired another guy I know today. Acting Attorney General. Robert Mueller's boss. A bonehead from Iowa. At what point does the number of people me &amp; Trump have in common disqualify him for the presidency? At the very least legit grounds to start the process for 25th Amendment
@Rincewind1970 @VICELANDFR I quit when he does
@claire_mancha I guess Matt doing the right thing for America would be recusing himself?
@RediNNevada @realDonaldTrump I'm just putting it out there:)
@mamaprogressive Think? Then you‚Äôre been on different phone calls with her than I have these last 2 weeks. I have full confidence in the Pelosi family &amp; the folks they currently surround themselves with for the multiple tasks at hand.They were well prepared for yesterday. And today. And tomorrow.
I know Matthew Whitaker. He played football at Iowa. We all have crazy tweets in our past. He was a lineman after all. Today Matt got a new job &amp; Hawkeye Nation is happy for one of our own because we know Matt Whittaker will ignore politics &amp; do the right things for America. https://t.co/G3FAyLGvbi
@Yamiche @seungminkim You are amazing
@jason_howerton The President is unwell buddy...
"I've been hearing about tapes. I never used racist remarks" Okay. @realDonaldTrump Just made on official statement from The White House. The American people deserve the truth. The American people win finally get the truth. Let's do this! @RepAdamSchiff #PressConference
@quinncy Something similar if not exactly. He's 100% drugged. I'd bet he has something to pep him up too. His crazy doc prescribed diet pills for a long time so I'd guess he's doing that now. He's stressed. His kids encourage it. That's Ivanka's WH job. We are going to find out everything
The day after Democrats took back the House the face of the GOP incompetent President Donald Trump is speaking gibberish at a frightening rambling live press conference. He‚Äôs meeting Putin next. America‚Äôs in imminent danger Thank G-d for The Blue Wave, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Adam Schiff
@Kathy_Valentine @pulmyears Honest to G-d what this lady just wrote about a man is better than anything I‚Äôve seen in Washington in two years.

@stonerockj @Janefonda @RealJamesWoods I would kiss James Woods if it would magically awaken hm from the insane Trump Cult zombie state he‚Äôs been living in for several years like one of those Disney movies so then he could live out the rest of his days as regular asshole James Woods
@jason_howerton She‚Äôs a rookie tho...do your thing. I‚Äôll get down to Tex when the smoke clears
@cerzej @maitlis Nancy Pelosi. Not even close. She did this.
@IsaacDovere @RepCummings OMG...the arch of justice...someone tell Trump what that means...explain it to him every hour on the hour because he'll forget &amp; @IsaacDovere knows I speak truth
@jason_howerton Please make the Republican Party Conservative again. Not the Donald Trump Party. America used to work well that way. We will give you cover in The House.
@THR Who owns the movie rights to Trump's 2006? Ari Emanuel or Mark Burnett because "Donald Trump's Very Bad New Born Baby, Third Wife Choking, Playmate Banging, Porn Star Raw Dogging and Sexual Assaulting Everybody Year" Sounds like a hit.
@jason_howerton Obama won the Senate but he can tell it to him anyways
@jason_howerton They don't even let MMA guys stand over their opponents and taunt after they get knocked out much less a guy from the cheap seats.....dude....G-d will make sure you have a daughter too
#MSNBC just basically asked if Nancy Pelosi looked too pushy by asking for them even though they proved major crimes &amp; maybe she should "be more strategic because the president will exploit it" Holy crap I'm happy I know 100% Nancy Pelosi is not afraid of Donald Trump's bullshit. https://t.co/1320CRhXaH

Been a long build up to tomorrow.
@JuddApatow I see Hannity &amp; Don Jr. as a couple. President Trump &amp; Rush Limbaugh would definitely want to fuck the aliens. But Sean Hannity &amp; Donald Trump Jr. works. If you squint Kimberly Guilfoyle looks exactly like a young boyish Sean Hannity.
@MMFlint You ever been to Eastern Iowa 4th District in the middle of winter documentary boy? I'm sweating in your underwear right now just thinking about how humid it gets every August. The most embarrassing man in America White Supremacist Steve King gotta go.#VoteBlue2018 @Scholten4Iowa

@MotherJones Let‚Äôs vote like our lives depend on it.

Gr8! Best Real Trump Yet #25A
@jason_howerton I meant to compliment you on that...also how lucky is Tom Brady btw..diff topic..talk later
@simonamangiante Thank you &amp; of course you are right. It's not about politics. I'm her friend. Her friend that took her to vote 5 times yesterday &amp; we're hitting 6 different polling places tomorrow. Amazing disguises! But don't all spies have amazing disguises??? Kidding. Sissi is very funny too.
Next time you want to call me out for being crazy on a boring political show remember these guys were my co-hosts on The Best Damn Sports Show Period. https://t.co/DOlnlX9TGY
@jason_howerton Trump has told you so many lies you don't recognize truth anymore.
@MikeKemp15 @cryeleikegirl @realDonaldTrump @TheLeeGreenwood @SenJohnMcCain Correct. Donald Trump is Commander in Chief LOWLIFE!!!
@KathrynMaga @simonamangiante @GeorgePapa19 &amp; now who Donald Trump is..u should 2 b4 it‚Äôs 2 late
@staceydash You know it's unrequited love!! He thinks you are too stupid to ever be in charge!! He has always said black people are inferior!!!! Ask @MichaelCohen212
@morethanmySLE @Nataliew1020 @RepMaloney @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @jack @Twitter @TwitterSupport please give the famous, handsome &amp; selfless healthcare activist @morethanmySLE the blue check mark he deserves. Peter meets every member of Congress &amp; talks them into considering healthcare for the sick &amp; dying who cannot speak for themselves in DC.

@realDonaldTrump @TheLeeGreenwood Love that song!! Almost like visiting the troops in a war zone, huh? Oh that's right. you're never visited troops in a war zone. Makes you forget you dodged the draft 5 times &amp; @SenJohnMcCain never dodged anything? Course it does cause you're crazy but what's their else's excuse?
@4lisaguerrero Packers Tonight. Best Damn Sports Show 4ever #Voted ‚ù§Ô∏è#ElectionDay https://t.co/ZxFT2achkv
@jason_howerton Agreed
@ValueIt8 @GOPChairwoman @bennyjohnson And he mocked a disabled reporter onstage @GOPChairwoman you‚Äôve seen that I assume? Donald Trump also called Eric Trump the R-word on the Apprentice &amp; he never apologized.
@jason_howerton Again Pete was trying to be subtle &amp; make fun of himself with his comment but as I‚Äôve learned over &amp; over subtle funny only works if it‚Äôs funny. Otherwise it could seem like he was mocking the cool dude.
@jason_howerton I prefer ‚Äúdumb ass‚Äù and Pete Davidson is a really nice. Trust me. Pete Davidson appreciates the people who sacrifice for this country. It‚Äôs personal to him buddy.
@jason_howerton Yes!!!
@GOPChairwoman @bennyjohnson Pete Davidson told an ill conceived joke &amp; you're Chairwoman of White Supremacist Party whose leader Donald Trump incites violences on minorities, religions &amp; citizens he hates. He's committed Treason, looted US Treasury, taking away health care from dying people so eat crap toad
@CalVic932 @RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama I'm over Russia. Trump's a White Supremacist who lies &amp; steals &amp; incites violence every time he speaks. He's incompetent &amp; incapable of empathy or humanity or humility &amp; has no concept of being of service to others. Donald Trump has no concept of America. He will start WW3. Vote!
@WalshFreedom @matange2 hell yeah
@SykesCharlie Pete was trying to subtly make fun of himself. Not every comic is as on the head as Larry the Cable Guy. Also not every comic is as skilled as Larry the Cable Guy. Or as funny. Let's be honest no one is as funny as Larry the Cable Guy.
@netanyahu @benshapiro Call your buddy @realDonaldTrump He doesn't get it. Better yet call his handlers. Maybe they'll keep him distracted for a couple days so he can't hurt anyone. He likes to look at golf pictures. Of his courses. Glossy. Not ultra-glossy. Glossy. There's your first 12 hrs. Your up.
@IvankaTrump @RepKristiNoem Bullshit You &amp; White Supremacist Dad are in court right now suing to take health care from sick kids &amp; anyone with pre-existing conditions &amp; she supports you monsters. Also @IvankaTrump is currently looting US Treasury &amp; she's a big coward so women may lose their right to choose.
@jordanrussellny @IvankaTrump That is not true &amp; I'm saying it publicly &amp; putting my name on it. My bud repped a woman Ivanka fired from her company because she became pregnant. Ivanka paid hush money but had Eric Trump &amp; her lawyer harass them to make sure it stayed quiet. Ivanka is Donald Trump's daughter.
@Redpainter1 @matange2 Mother Pence did not sign up for this bullshit.
@andylassner @matange2 Note to self: It's time to read Bible 2.0
@IvankaTrump Unless they get sick or pregnant &amp; then you're like "fuck em!"@IvankaTrump Your fancy fur coats will finally be practical when you &amp; your family of grifters live in Siberia in 2 years. Jared will be with "Daddy" in prison. Who calls their father "daddy" when they're 35? F Jared!!
@JohninCary @RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama Irony is dead
@DeanObeidallah @soledadobrien Like flies on shit
@connortryan @maggieNYT In Trump‚Äôs defense they put beautiful barbed wire up around everything he bankrupts.
@marentes_robert @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs 3:30 am I just got up to pee &amp; my first thoughts were ‚ÄúI hate Trump and I‚Äôm much cooler than Robert‚Äù:damnit you are right. I will try it again in the morning. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #DaylightSavingsTime
@Fuctupmind Oh i will but first let‚Äôs pour one out for Don Jr...
@simonamangiante Just got in will get with you in the morning, think you‚Äôre pinging from Olympic? Hope you‚Äôre not alone. The friend I met in car is there i hope? Don‚Äôt panic S Sorry for all this but we will fix it. ICE &amp; FBI not same so call me &amp; # agent McSweeney gave u if anything happens 2nite
@iamwillproject @RawStory @realDonaldTrump @AndrewGillum I am more familiar with trumps racism than most also know whaI gets to hm no way in my mind my absurd observation connects anyone but Trump. Also it‚Äôs true
@isaiah_scales @originstory3x @RealCandaceO Yo
@isaiah_scales @originstory3x @RealCandaceO Scales could be my son &amp; we lived on the same street. Same schools through college.I moved to LA and wound up at Fox so did he &amp; my nephew Biggie is his bestie
@infinitesimull I would‚Äôve added ‚ÄúIs also a huge dick‚Äù for the 10:30 show
@andrewklavan @benshapiro @Twitter @michaeljknowles @jack hahahahahaha Can Ben give him his letter jacket now? He's a good boy
@sloschooled let's be honest. I said he was gonna say it before he said it. It's still brave. Also no one beats me to the punch on Trump's racism unless he himself says the N-word at a rally in the next 60 hours which is 50/50..okay...75/25..old dude's ti-ti..
@N_8675309 yes it was sad we didn't get to see the tape before my beloved trump's nuclear holocaust........
@madasfire If he resigns tonight I will do it.
Dude. Turn up the volume.I am literally listening to #TrumpTapes of Donald Trump, Ivanka, lawyers &amp; folks who now work in the White House having a private business meeting secretly recorded in Donald Trump's Trump Tower office during a break from The Celebrity Apprentice May 2012 https://t.co/iFYuQQaz6y
@GlennKesslerWP its called a fucking lie dude
@Nataliew1020 @morethanmySLE @RepMaloney @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand I mean this guy 24/7 plus Peter has my back every fistfight ‚ù§Ô∏è you do too Natalie but Peter brings the dog
@jason_howerton here's an idea..forget your feud with Acosta...dig into your father empathy...use your journalist integrity to see how many lies the add contains. Take a moment to consider everything you know in your heart &amp; make a damn decision like fricking Aaron Rodgers would. It's 4th &amp; goal
@jason_howerton buddy at some point....you've gotta smell what the rock is cooking...dude....don't worry Texas won't disown you.
@RawStory Stormy Daniels also said you weren't equipped for sex but you went on to sexually assault a bunch of women @realDonaldTrump
@psstricia @PhilipRucker @maggieNYT even Trump hates suck ups so that guy's in hell &amp; he's shaming generations of DeSantis' everytime he opens his pathetic yapper. Now he sucking up the spawn of a reality star. Does he not know normal people don't go into reality tv unless they've screwed up literally everything?
@nypost you goddamn right they are!!
@MirrorFootball @DailyMirror Piers Morgan over there so...51/49...
@MirrorFootball @DailyMirror Couldn't stand Trump either
@yashar @UnderstoodOrg ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@PhilipRucker @maggieNYT He can visit them in prison in Danbury just like everybody else
@isaiah_scales @RealCandaceO Ottumwa Iowa in the house!!!!
@briankoppelman @JuddApatow Do not say that to the Secret Service.
@this1wierdgirl what up kiddo?
@ScottMStedman @dbongino The word is stupid. Dan Bongino is stupid. You're welcome.
@realDonaldTrump I think it's another caravan. Call Don Jr!!!
@AuthorColinBMW @marieproia @TheRickWilson The story's still unfolding. I've got lots of notes. When I do a project I research &amp; spend time with the principals together &amp; alone &amp; with various others to get their input. Lots of eyeballs on these kids &amp; their fams &amp; friends here &amp; abroad. It's even better than u think Rick.
@BeeHiveBae @TrueFactsStated That elevator pic is a one sheet if I ever saw one
@andreagonram @feministabulous Ivanka fired female exec cause she was pregnant (bud repped woman) she &amp; Eric Trump harassed her &amp; lawyer's firm until he quit law.ALSO she walked into dad's Trump Tower office in the middle of every 2012 bus meeting, set same papers on desk "we need to address this" walked out.
@geoffschwartz you hate Michigan, huh?
@TrueFactsStated this guy needs a movie too when this is over good lord
@kimmasters @CNN Mortality is eye opening. There's more he can do right now. It's not over but it can be. Then Jeff Zucker will have the best story ever.
@ScottMStedman Another @realDonaldTrump @parscale lie. Facebook is controlled by Republicans.   They will answer for it after Nov 6.. Vote. Literally the fate of the free world depends on it &amp; there is only one side. @BlackCatUnloads
@realDonaldTrump What about Renate?
@TheRickWilson Her mom in law is the worst. Will be my fav part of a well documented love story involving incompetent R's &amp; RW bloggers, Mueller, an earnest Chi-Town mama's boy meets blonde bomb from "Europe" who's been dumped on by crap men. She's good hearted OR the greatest Russian Spy ever.
@andylassner Mother in-laws, huh? These kids just got married. I predict they end up being best friends.
@Strikeoutlookin @Atchison1220 @DonaldJTrumpJr Buddy!!
This small young woman is at work doing her job &amp; not only gets screamed at by this big crazy man but he spits at her. Where were the other men with him? Do these guys think because Trump is president they all get to bully whoever the hell they want now? F that. Step the f up men https://t.co/EGPvJjA35T
@lifesafeast @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorBrakey @DonaldJTrumpJr was promised a pardon. End of story. He hates his father.
@gregorya57 @airbagmoments @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorBrakey They won't. Nobody really gets away with it. You saw the ghoul Trump family walk of shame in Pittsburg. It's all finally crumbling. 15,000 troops to the border? He has Don Jr. as his main campaign surrogate? In 2018? With a good economy? Vote November 6. Everything changes Nov 7.
@Pattiwithaneye @emilyjanefox DM me. Mark Burnett overstayed his nanny visa.I have that paperwork. Burnett got paid under the table. You'd think he'd be more sensitive to the plight of immigrants maybe put in a word with his bud Trump like I asked but no. Shame if ICE made Burnett go back to UK &amp; get in line.
@rmayemsinger the anti-Christ is a big deal I'm told so maybe he's right
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorBrakey The Trump family have operated a 50 yr pyramid scam defrauding investors, employees &amp; IRS. You cheat, lie, grift &amp; loot the US Treasury while the GOP supports White Supremacy, Russian Interference in our elections &amp; voter suppression of people of color. #CantWait2Vote #AngusKing
@tarastrong @YouTube This is awesome @tarastrong so much going on here. Also you &amp; EG dang.....
@theclaw070 @montill @203nanny @emilyjanefox Sorry bud. Little harsh. Stressful weekend. 3 more days.
@theclaw070 @montill @203nanny @emilyjanefox You are a condescending twat. I‚Äôm with Monica but don‚Äôt feel too sorry for his racist supporters.
@KeshaCooper @MsDarcyFarrow @Comey @MichelleObama @HillaryClinton They are. We‚Äôre aware. We have insurance for everything including poll watchers &amp; lawyers on the ground in places like Texas &amp; Florida Incase there‚Äôs a recount. We‚Äôve never been more prepared for election nonsense from inside &amp; out but overwhelming vote is still our best weapon.
@RichardMNephew @matange2 You‚Äôre wasting your time mate. He cannot read.
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama Volunteer do something? @DonaldJTrumpJr literally committed treason in Trump Tower during the campaign.
@jason_howerton @JordanUhl It is brilliant. Produced perfectly. Alex Jones is brilliant in it. Straight up. Like technically &amp; artistically. I honestly thought it was the best parody ever because I‚Äôd thought he‚Äôd given up but it‚Äôs him &amp;  if this is his plan B I think he has crossover talent &amp; WTF..:)
@RealDeanCain Go ahead &amp; keep being stupid. Did you see the debt? Donald Trump bankrupts every company he runs. He‚Äôs incompetent, incoherent &amp; dangerous. A threat to the air we breath, the water we drink &amp; the existence of the human race but those jobs numbers! Speaker Pelosi will be just fine
@brooklynmarie As last long as she‚Äôs praying for him to get to know the business end of his buddy‚Äôs bone saw it‚Äôs all good.
@staceydash But you believe Trump? Michael Cohen used to defend Trump too.
@umadbro83 @SaraCarterDC @DonaldJTrumpJr says a guy with no life even on twitter
@isle_o_selkirk He heard it worked for you
@pierrecot Mark Burnett he's a fake Evangelical. Roma Downey is a real greedy Evangelical and a liar.
@Pattiwithaneye @emilyjanefox where was it based and what name?
@baderlooming @akhilnayak007 @RonanFarrow of you could watch #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes for yourself https://t.co/FT3ueVcpKQ @iTunesTV Or I tweeted a bit of Trump Tower Apprentice Tape May 2012
@Yaktuary @AaronBlake @SethAbramson I‚Äôm suing for several things that will allow the discovery of everything
@SaraCarterDC @DonaldJTrumpJr You got Renate's back too?
@karentravers @DavidCornDC If only there were a secret service who could tell him he incites violence...oh they have? He doesn't listen? Now what? @PressSec Vote Nov 6 and keep voting until Sarah Sanders quits lying for @realDonaldTrump The Most Dangerous Man in the World.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @tedcruz Imagine if he was your dad though buddy? How awesome would that have been? Who's kidding who now I'm imagining he was my dad. Holy hell I bet I wouldn't be so crazy...and I'd only be like 5 or 6 years old. Are you awake @DonaldJTrumpJr ??
@JeffGelberg just vote &amp; make sure everyone you know votes &amp; make them show proof. I don't trust those lazy bastards Jeff
@akhilnayak007 @RonanFarrow Put on your big boy panties buddy &amp; go knock on some doors. Work a phone back. Drive some people to the polls. Have you even voted son? Has everyone you know voted? Make sure they have &amp; then come back &amp; see me &amp; we will compare notes.

@emilyjanefox @MarkBurnettTV love to air Apprentice Trump Tapes Sun Night. Our country is in trouble. @MichaelCohen212 stepped up. It's on you &amp; @MGMTelevision @MGM_Studios #KevinUlrich &amp; Anchorage Capitol should be aware they could've helped. Burnett lied to you &amp; America to cover for Trump.
@emilyjanefox Mark Burnett immigrated to the US from the UK, forged docs, took money under the table has made hundreds of millions including Trump Inauguration. Imagine if Burnett showed Trump's racist Apprentice comments. MGM has them. Trump would lose his fake moral high ground instantly.
@benshapiro and you will never be George RR Martin son but you will have time to comment on his comments so that's something I guess!
@BlueSkyz22 @netanyahu @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump Bad photoshop
@DrTigger @TwitchyTeam You are bad at insults
@DaileyOfficial @benshapiro Will there be a dinner &amp; ceremony or do you guys just send me a trophy in the mail?
@yashar We're wrestling. That's the first poster. Expect nothing less from a member of the WWE Hall of Fame.
@nathanTbernard @charliekirk11 I'd phrase that different
@DonaldJTrumpJr Can my kids live off your dad to?
@CorruptBobby @RubinReport @DonaldJTrumpJr @benandjerrys @mccsicecream @ACTBrigitte @Ayaan awssd
@Real_PeachyKeen @DonaldJTrumpJr They are rednecks. I filmed my redneck show there. I filmed all my Redneck shows there. Great wild boar hunting
@Hagtweet @jaketapper You aren't from here are you? Trump doesn't even like that 30%. Fuck em. They can crawl back in their snakes hole when this is over.
@rescino_lynn She has to sue him. All the women have to sue. His bloodsucking donors can pay since he won't.
@stjames91557 @historyKehoe @jaketapper not true..these huge corporations are complicated &amp; ham fisted &amp; stupid sometimes
@MaryLouBolger Credit mom last yr but now it's a thing. He writes Candy Witch love notes. Leave stuff outside for her randomly without telling dad. Been lucky to catch it on security camera's more often then not &amp; scramble for a gift in exchange for the popsicles or whatever he puts at door:):)
@benshapiro masculinity is not giving a fuck about masculinity
Jax broke his record for quantity &amp; tonnage last nite but tonite before our home becomes crazytown the Candy Witch comes &amp; takes this to the poor kids whose parents don‚Äôt let em eat sugar even on Halloween. Spoiler Alert: Candy Witch leaves a gift for Jax so I pre-plan this magic https://t.co/UymniYvIN1
@jaketapper MGM stores The Apprentice On TLO technology so every moment of Trump is on there after the show went digital 2005 &amp; this is why its important the American public sees their racist, sexually harassing, lying incompetent on a 12 hour HD loop. He‚Äôll lose ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù to do this
@SteveSchmidtSES Who these cowards are: Trump called Andy McCabe‚Äôs wife loser. She‚Äôs an emergency room pediatrician. Imagine children‚Äôs lives she saved? Trump slandered her about taking illegal money from Hillary &amp; him from FBI. Trump made Sessions fire him Xmas eve while they were home with kids
@RubinReport @DonaldJTrumpJr @benandjerrys @mccsicecream @ACTBrigitte @Ayaan Okay then this should make it official. ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúLiberal Tears‚Äù can only be used by you losers ironically.
@staceydash @LizFine hahahahahah ‚ù§Ô∏è@LizFine
@cpinthenyc @RealDeanCain @THR right back at you!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump record is 7 N-words in one day on the set of The Apprentice. Same day he made you cry because he liked Eric's tie more. @DonaldJTrumpJr @MarkBurnettTV will choke a bitch to keep your dad's secret but MGM share holders don't dig you white supremacists #KevinUlrich
@bennettpatches @staceydash GOP is worse than Trump. He has a character defect which makes him incapable of honesty or empathy. This renders him incompetent for one job absolutely: President of The United States. Family &amp; friends like Mark Burnett  knew this. The entire GOP know it now. They do not care.
@Deadspin DO NOT let that coach vote Nov 6th.
@DonaldJTrumpJr you ever been to the panhandle dude?
@staceydash couldn't find any good shit Trump was doing huh?
@sharonstone Damnit @DonaldJTrumpJr you would've gotten 1/5th of that when dad died. Ugh.
@QAnonPatriot @patmiletich with a full deck...
@jaketapper @seungminkim @PaulBegala @DavidJUrban @SusanPage @TheLeadCNN Trump wants 10 soldiers for every baby
@JonahNRO Okay easy to understand. Next time let‚Äôs agree no one gets to president America who hasn‚Äôt read the constitution, bible, torah, any legislation, business deal or an entire book or has accepted responsibility for a single thing in his entire life. Not hyperbole. It‚Äôs getting worse
@megynkelly @brianstelter Allegedly. My personal friends The Daily Mail tell a much different story. Get off Twitter &amp; call the police unless you‚Äôre using this for public sympathy. Stalking is nothing to take lightly. This is how you interviewed me after I was assaulted by Mark Burnett &amp; Roma Downey lied.
@pemersonvb111 @michaeljknowles @DispatchAlerts @OhioPoliticsNow By ‚Äúwe‚Äù he means him &amp; mail bomber.
@Wolfe321 Happy Halloween!!! https://t.co/pgRa1vCb2y
@JoyceWhiteVance @matange2 @AricToler Mike Pence is that stupid. He let a fake fake Jew ‚ÄúRabbi‚Äù pray for Pittsburg Synagogue victims at his Sat night rally
@Wolfe321 Okay 3rd worst taboo because murder would be worse than being #antiSemitic &amp; incest is horrible. So those are 3 things. Terrible things. There you go.
@Wolfe321 No..i need to quit before you realize you have far too much class to be associating with the likes of me. I was being a wise guy. When i see you I‚Äôll explain. I agree with your original point 100%
@McFaul @matange2 Did they shoot the rehearsal? Do coverage on this scene? Get it in one? They seemed like old pals and the dialogue was pretty good. Even Trump seemed relaxed. Jonathan‚Äôs head tap was a bit stilted but otherwise excellent. I‚Äôd still look at the other takes but it‚Äôs not my show.
@Wolfe321 3rd
@Wolfe321 Hahaha..
@lifesafeast @Marmel Jesus don‚Äôt be. They won‚Äôt make it to the border. Not like that. Plus everything is unraveling finally. Today was huge. Vote though!!!
@Wolfe321 I pray #AntiSemitism isnt the second worst taboo he‚Äôs violated with his own daughter.

@andylassner or he's really trying to get in Jacob Wohl's mom's pants
@JonahNRO @benshapiro speak English MF!!!! Trump's too dumb &amp; you're too smart. Who's going to tell us what to do? We Are Screwed. Cripes!!
@scottstedman Good work young man helping expose Jacob Wohl's phony campaign to discredit American Hero Robert Mueller. If only we had a time machine we could send you all the way back to Nov 2017 when Roger Stone did the same thing to Al Franken but got away with it. Until Nov 7
@JustSchmeltzer @JaneMayerNYer @vermontgmg hahahahahahahahahaahaahahahahahahhahaaahahahahahhaa
@ScottMStedman @JacobAWohl Go go go. This is your moment
@BNONews @ScottMStedman "appears" dude!! bury them now!

@JaneMayerNYer @NatashaBertrand The hoaxers asked journalist @ScottMStedman  to do some work on it and he confirms it‚Äôs fake &amp; he has receipts
@soledadobrien Hahaha. Yes it is. So lame. A little disconcerting too
@janendg2016 @staceydash I could pretend to be marginally talented at selling out for a nickel to the shiniest racist available without a whiff of integrity or awareness for those who came before me &amp; obviously zero concern for those who will come after. Candace Owen is the most pathetic &amp; saddest of all
@jason_howerton @Truthmotiv8 I‚Äôm a hell of a babysitter. Might bright Jax he charges. Food lots of Texas food Night us boys are tired dad was in 5 states on the east coast in 3 days this weekend !!
@ScottMStedman It‚Äôs complicated. Somebody smart said you should be able to get on a publication to cover your butt legally
@phildo1965 @trumpovic02 @LeahR77 How shitty is your life you‚Äôre desperately trying to connect with me?? #sad
@jason_howerton @Truthmotiv8 Ell yeah..i gotta get back to Texas
@BubbaRoby It was very funny. Plus she‚Äôs retired. You‚Äôre right let the retired old lady have some piece Donald Trump. He called her crooked Hillary yesterday and they chanted lock her up. Cripes she had a pipe bomb delivered to her house. Nick Saban would not allow Bama fans to do that bro.
@gardenerbobe @benshapiro i'd have gone with projectile diarrhea but that's me
@Realronmexico99 @PFTCommenter @McCourtyTwins give her a few months she will...
@byroncarroll @benshapiro i don't know bub a fucking shit ton of toothless mouth breathers tweet stupid crap at me. What's that mean ya think?
@Publius762 @benshapiro No Ben cannot comment! No more free speech! I know everything about Ben's experience! Cool? Any other questions? Enjoy your evening &amp; vote blue Nov 6!
@Truthmotiv8 @jason_howerton I'm more of an offensive guy. Jason would agree:)
@Sh3_J0 wait...slow down!!!
@GhostInTheWolf @lispausa @jaketapper red herrings...Trump is a White Supremacist &amp; you are complicit. Those are the exact talking points to divert attention from Trump's behavior. Nice work.
@staffordana Show went digital in 2005. Cameras never stopped rolling. Stored on LTO technology in 2 locations. You might call it a tape. Quitters never win. I have a Trump Tape in my big sweaty hand now. Trump's pulling out the big guns literally with the army. Maybe we'll have something too
@ScottMStedman Stedman I don't know exactly how this turns out but I do know karma &amp; in-laws from hell are in your future buddy
@staceydash Of course they aren't coming in. They don't even get here for weeks. Caravans come up from Central America all the time because of the war on drugs. We did a thing there in 2009 so it's kinda our fault. They've never gotten in. You're thinking of The Alamo kiddo. That was in 1836
@jason_howerton Trump is sending active duty personal to the border for a fake weeks away caravan that happens all the time. Also the legal way for them to seek asylum. And of course they come in a group for safety. But let's focus on the media. Pray no military get hurt doing Trump's stunt show
@BubbaRoby Bubba!! You're a fan...admit it!!!!!
@staceydash Give it up friend. Trump‚Äôs going with Candace Owen. You‚Äôre too risky. You‚Äôve actually done something with your life pre Trump cult. She‚Äôs an empty husk. Come back into the light! You are loved. Trump‚Äôs the racist. Don‚Äôt cover for him anymore. He abuses women. You‚Äôre a good mother
@ldcamerlin @BullToss69 @NWsparrow @benshapiro Ok then explain it to normal people
@ldcamerlin @NWsparrow @benshapiro Can you people make up your tiny minds?
@NWsparrow @benshapiro Bigger than Trump? Thank you brother!! MAGA
@jason_howerton Remember Sam Donaldson?  That guy really got Reagan going. I‚Äôm old
@jason_howerton Never!!! He is annoying
@michaelrosenbum @ichadlowe @Giants We should‚Äôve drafted my son Sam. Sam Darnold. His momthought it would be too much pressure to be amazing living with the last name Arnold so she added the D..okay she added the D for divorce. His mom is not a fan anymore that‚Äôs why she made my son join the hated Jets!!! Women!!!!
@michaelrosenbum @ichadlowe @Giants There has to be a worse word than suck because that‚Äôs what our Giants are doing right now
@jason_howerton I know but she‚Äôs retired and she just got a pipe bomb but trump is still ‚Äúcrooked Hillary‚Äù and lock her up. It‚Äôs not you but jeez Louise
@jason_howerton But one guy not life or death or matters to our kids futures
@jason_howerton There is zero good faith from the Trump Administration. Starting with Trump. Sarah Sanders gets paid by me to lie for Trump. It‚Äôs an outrage. So good for Jim Acosta. If he‚Äôs your problem you aren‚Äôt paying attention.
@RobKossTN Not about her or media. Just Trump. He‚Äôs president. Capable of causing most mayhem. I know Secret Service tells an ordinary citizen when he makes a Trump joke on twitter:He might incite an unwell person to commit violence. They tell Trump he has much more power but he won‚Äôt stop.
@Kim09660642 @Marcy_Kid @HANSENWT1 @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump You suck
@Marcy_Kid @HANSENWT1 @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha
@cbessex @benshapiro @AmandaPresto Intellect means nothing these days if you don‚Äôt have the courage to wield it dear
@problemsolved56 @netanyahu @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump You are in the worlds stupidest cult
@SpuriousLartius @benshapiro He‚Äôs not even aware he described Donald Trump perfectly
@ScottMStedman @matange2 Maybe it‚Äôs time to move on to bigger fish. Mark Burnett fudged his immigration papers &amp; took money under the table. He‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs Co-conspirator. Millions in US tax breaks. If Mark Burnett wasnt Donald Trump‚Äôs cover up guy Ice would‚Äôve send him back to UK  to get in line by now.
@jason_howerton Gonna lock her up for being funny now I guess
@bennyjohnson You don‚Äôt hate it do you?
@Roxanne_USA @jason_howerton @NewsPolitics They are doing it legally people. Look it up.
@rkmcarthy @benshapiro I wasn‚Äôt even talking to you but now you‚Äôve insulted me and my friend. I‚Äôm in the real world today. Give me your address

@polishangel2003 @jaketapper That‚Äôs why the state of NY took away your license
@benshapiro Coward
@LahavHarkov @benshapiro I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre amazing. Please take a beat though. There‚Äôs a lot of crossfire here &amp; your fine words are being used to brickbat good guys.
@LahavHarkov @benshapiro You are the one who jumped on the back of a fellow Jew first. I saw because a Trump clown retweeted you to pile on her even more. Trump is the problem. He is a white Supremacist &amp; a Jewish female journalist like a Julie is literally he &amp; his bases holy grail.
Mark Burnett‚Äôs Donald Trump‚Äôs good friend &amp; business partner. Makes millions The Apprentice, Trump Inauguration. Talks to Potus. Travels with VP Pence. Burnett‚Äôs an immigrant. Came to US, faked docs got paid under table but wont stand up for immigrants of color. Why is MB racist?
@ChelseaClinton He read the TelePrompTer like he‚Äôd been shot with a tranquilizer dart
@LahavHarkov @benshapiro Stop it. You sit in Israel &amp; do Trump‚Äôs dirty work for him. Attacking another Jew. Shame on you. We have a crisis here in America. We always support Israel. If you can‚Äôt help don‚Äôt hurt. You are an awful woman &amp; awful men are retweeting you here.
@netanyahu @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump encourages his White Supremacist base because Donald Trump is a White Supremacist. America will always support Israel. We need Israel to support America now. @netanyahu stand up publicly for America &amp; all Jews to Donald Trump &amp; his racist supporters. #NeverForget
@benshapiro Poor little Ben. Couldn‚Äôt wait to jump in and pile on the woman. Just like Trump. Even small men can be bullies. Only small men are bullies. You have no idea her experience. Shut up and listen.
@Most_Deplorable @artnpen75 @trichards189 @jaketapper Let me help you knuckle draggers out. We met when I was 23 just out of college so yeah, no career. We got divorced in 1994. After which I‚Äôve appeared in 130 films &amp; starred in 6 TV series &amp; 5 Cable Special. I‚Äôve written 12 movies 8 series &amp; a book. Voice of Arby‚Äôs Oven Mitt etc;)
@SusanKingsleyW Well that was a complete waste of Twitter time. Don‚Äôt come back here until you have a point.
@JefferyScottHa1 @therealroseanne Keep flipping burgers pal
@nzpete54 @realDonaldTrump Like he‚Äôs going to answer you dip shit. Even Trump hates New Zealand narcs
@CharlesRock90 @jaketapper How many characters is Trump giving you inbreds?
@PressSec @bennyjohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I‚Äôve never read a single word in @washingtonpost about your glass eye @PressSec
Has Trump weighed in on Packers vs Rams yet?
@tomperriello @joncoopertweets Truth
@TVietor08 @joncoopertweets So does @realDonaldTrump @CNN
@Redpainter1 @matange2 How do we get our catheters for when we pilot our little airplanes???
@KierstenMagic @candacecbure @themattwalton @hallmarkmovie I talked to @themattwalton last time i was in NY too but he‚Äôs no @candacecbure hahaha
@KierstenMagic @candacecbure @themattwalton @hallmarkmovie I just saw my beloved @candacecbure at the Philly airport. The beautiful young woman is solid gold..‚ù§Ô∏è 2nd best daughter ever #MoonlightAndMisteltoe
@TrumpGoAway @Jeremyland16 @shaunking @VICE @CRTV There‚Äôs room for improvement at Vice too but that guy got kicked out along time ago. He‚Äôs a coward and a fraud. Dangerous too. You know, like Trump.
@jhudd2 Limp wristed Sally is giving me a ride to the polls Nov 6th
@radkmc1964 @KnowledgeGeek @maggieNYT Ok i will resign the presidency immediately
@NatashaBertrand @TomSteyer Duh...that‚Äôs exactly why he..wait..you already knew that‚Äôs how Trump has to work his dumbass base &amp; in Trump‚Äôs defense, his base is too stupid to do subtle. That‚Äôs why Don Jr. is out campaigning. Makes Don Sr. look smart like guy who guesses your weight at the Iowa State Fair.
@Mimirocah1 @matange2 Thank you. I‚Äôve got your back always. We are out here too üîØ‚ù§Ô∏è
@jaketapper Tell him to do his fucking job &amp; stop watching TV. Tell him he‚Äôs a pathetic excuse for a man much less Potus.Tell him he shouldn‚Äôt have run if he wasn‚Äôt going to take responsibility for anything. Tell him CNN is done having his sycophants on &amp; his cowardice enable acts of terror.
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Well you‚Äôve done everything humanly possible considering your limited access to anyone in power. Nice Avi for this statement too.
@tarastrong @NRA Do people need to see the carnage AR-15 reaps on human bodies to act? Pittsburgh FBI agent said the synagogue was worst thing he‚Äôs seen in 22 yrs including plane crashes. @FoxNews  mocked Obama for crying after Sandy Hook. Maybe we all have to see 1st graders with heads blown off
@RandyRRQuaid @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump told me to invite you to his next rally buddy. He said he wanted you to surprise him!!! Big bear hugs!!!!
@andylassner It‚Äôs called common sense &amp; it‚Äôs non-partisan. 95% of America wants common sense gun laws. @NRA &amp; politicians they own starting with @realDonaldTrump lie, cheat &amp; steal to make sure weapons of war are in the hands of domestic terrorists that do not have to pass background checks.
@DonHaddock3 So that‚Äôs how you trick grade school kids into reading my tweets to you. Illiteracy is a handicap that can be overcome my friend. Get to work. Make your children proud. Maybe you‚Äôll be able to read my tweets to them!
@Just_A_Joe @realDonaldTrump PS. You are racist and @realDonaldTrump sucks.
@TrumpGoAway @shaunking @VICE @CRTV Hell no
@realDonaldTrump I promise we‚Äôll say you won if you quit now. Maybe you keep an office in Trump Tower. Just what I‚Äôve seen is so so bad. #resign
@theorangedouche @tigertux @InSpiteOfTrump @iTunesTV @LisaBloom Think you‚Äôd be pleasantly surprised with our current efforts..and I‚Äôve got Trump Tapes
@qwerty3321333 Trump thinks it is
@JDiebler15 @shaunking It‚Äôs a weapon of war. Was designed for war. I saw it‚Äôs battlefield carnage firsthand in Afghanistan 2007 &amp; my heart breaks every time I think of the size of wounds these killing machines reap on tiny precious little children. G-d have mercy on your souls Trump cult. I won‚ÄôtüîØüôèüëä
@maggieNYT This garbage person spews more bile every time he opens his disgusting mouth but...a newborn baby‚Äôs bris?  It‚Äôs going to get worse because he‚Äôll make it worse &amp; everyone who really knows him knows this. He‚Äôs going to resign but I could use a hand. #AriEmanuel #KevinUlrich

@letsgomathias @Scholten4Iowa @SteveKingIA Now you‚Äôve got my attention
@GPollowitz Am i right?
@ndrew_lawrence He‚Äôs all in. He even shushed her with his unusually long pointy finger.
@DavidAFrench @benshapiro Stop lying! What is wrong with you people? You know damn well Ben‚Äôs not the last guy. He not even the millionth guy. There‚Äôs A hundred &amp; fifteen guys in America so if Ben was the ten millionth guy he‚Äôd still be a pretty solid dude so why lie man?.
@RealDeanCain @tarastrong You‚Äôre in the cult dude
@ScarlettSavage6 @realDonaldTrump @mrothfeld I‚Äôm good. Just wish Trump would do his job or resign

@DLoesch @benshapiro Easy for you to say. You were never a guest on the show.
@MattWalshBlog @benshapiro Save the lecture pal. Not today. Come back in a week when i know the last of that maniac‚Äôs packages have passed through the system &amp; people can stand down where I live.
@_TheCivilRight @DonaldJTrumpJr You guys aren‚Äôt all riding in a van by chance?
@benshapiro Hahaha finally!!! Now take 2 weeks off son please mom &amp; me are begging
@roknrolzombie @yashar You know I had more than one but no windows dude &amp; plush seats for entertaining the ladies...tequila sunrise painted on the outside...so so southern Iowa suede
@benshapiro My bad..you‚Äôre all good
Soros gave this guy a sweet van #FloridaMan
@yashar Van stickers are marketed specifically to crazy people.
@patmiletich @investigatormc @realDonaldTrump Sadly? That‚Äôs good news bud. You‚Äôll be in a cave.
@ScarlettSavage6 Mark Burnett‚Äôs made hundreds of millions of dollars in America &amp; he tells people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the most powerful man in show biz. The president is my best friend‚Äù but he‚Äôs here illegally according to @realDonaldTrump  so he should pay the fines &amp; go back to the UK &amp; get in line.@mrothfeld
@PKRenovations @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Enjoy your government viagra!
@LillyKBaker I won‚Äôt &amp; now that we are filing a civil lawsuit against Mark Burnett &amp; Roma Downey &amp; Megyn Kelly defended with an official statement from MGM calling me a stalker because of #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes I will 100% get the Trump Tapes in discovery plus Burnett immigrated illegally!!
@tarastrong @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs his turn to get interviewed by the Secret Service
@theNuzzy @4lisaguerrero And yes. I‚Äôve had experience with both
@theNuzzy @4lisaguerrero No but Trump is toast. Mueller or cardioid artery‚Äôs? Only G-d knows...
@JamesRMarkey Or you can fly down to Hutcheson Kansas
@JamesRMarkey MGM has a big screening room in Century City
@4lisaguerrero It won‚Äôt get that far but John Roberts would make Kavanaugh recuse himself
@jjobie123 @benshapiro @patmiletich You don‚Äôt like money do you?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump So weird to see to talking about this big boy stuff when your dad calls you a fucking idiot &amp; you‚Äôre going to be indicted soon. Maybe that‚Äôs why. You‚Äôre going to prison for him. Your wife was right. Hahaha.
@Tammi08782307 @SecretService @FBI @USMarshalsHQ @POTUS Where do you work?
@Tammi08782307 @SecretService @FBI @USMarshalsHQ @POTUS You're off to a shit start spreading all these conspiracy lies around like a crazy person. Your version of christianity doesn't make any sense. simplify it. What goes around comes around. You've got too many leading men. too many moving parts. &amp; you are definitely in Trump Cult.
@merry_loy @CNN @CNNOpinion already early voted missy
@Starrynight1964 @megynkelly thank you...also look what happens when you defend Trump's buddy's Mark Burnett and Roma Downey...I tried to tell her but...:)
@wearesuperman @suzymusing you gotta copywrite that and bumpersticker it before @patmiletich thinks of it:)
@wearesuperman @suzymusing aint that the truth
@why2ys @TMZ Imagine how crazy it was in person? @TheRickWilson wrote a book about it #EverythingTrumpTouchesDies
@Starrynight1964 @megynkelly to be fair it's still not mine:)
@donnajgalindo @skulesa9527 hahaha thanks?
@EarthlingMoe I'm not a crazy person who shows up uninvited to a rally &amp; challenges the President to a fight. I have too much respect for the office of President of the United States &amp; that would be insane. But if he wanted to wrestle me I would. No fee. First class air fare &amp; room of course.
@jessejamesrich pretty self explanatory but https://t.co/FT3ueVcpKQ On Demand @iTunesTV #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes You'll see Donald Trump's friends @MarkBurnettTV willing to risk their companies @MGMTelevision &amp; getting sued for millions of dollars to protect their secrets with @realDonaldTrump
@pamala____ your opinion means everything:)
@wearesuperman Book it! And Vegan ice cream rocks! Did you know skipping meat just one meal a day saves 200,000 gallons of water a year? Not to mention the environment Animal agriculture pollutes more than carbon Plus your heart &amp; boners. My friend @suzymusing wrote The OMD Book #OMD4ThePlanet
@wearesuperman I'll be right over with 5 gallons of Ben &amp; Jerry's &amp; two spoons brother
@Tammi08782307 @SecretService @FBI @USMarshalsHQ @POTUS Q isn't G-d &amp; you are in a cult &amp; if you slander people with hysterical accusations you may trigger some MAGA nut to do something violent &amp; you'll probably get sued &amp; surely be doxed. Consider how busy Secret Service is today protecting America before you flag them for bullshit.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Smart Nov 7 isn't that far away &amp; they've heard the phone calls so they know he's toast.

@ScottMStedman dude give it a damn rest good lord #MercyRule
@benshapiro But you believe Julie too? You believe human women too? This is an important break through for you young Benjamin..
@ScottMStedman Her mother in law? Again? Been there. Nothing to see here folks. Typical first year of marriage stuff.........I'm rooting for the kids!!!!
@chrislhayes If it makes you feel any better he'd right one for a billion if he could get a boner.
@ShutUpAmanda thanks kiddo ...I dug in on this
@Timodc I've seen it &amp; know how easy it is for journalists to view. Need an IT guy, editor, a fork lift driver but promise in 24 hours 7 N-words, 3 open &amp; shut cases of sexual harassment, Don Sr makes Don Jr cry because he likes Eric's tie better..ok so maybe this is why NBC is hiding it
@Timodc 2005 The Apprentice went digital cameras didn't stop rolling &amp; all the footage is stored on LTO. Thousands of unedited hours they can't erase because technology &amp; FCC rules since it's a game show. i KNOW WHERE IT IS. I'll be @MSNBC @amjoyshow Sunday if someone is finally serious.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Double awks for you @DonaldJTrumpJr with your dad's 19 credible claims of sexual assault narrative
@theintercept @shaunking Sarah Sanders calls it "desert!"
@MorriseyWV @DonaldJTrumpJr @NRA @MorriseyWV buddy. You know who hates hunters? @realDonaldTrump He's never been hunting in his life. @DonaldJTrumpJr has another dad take him. Look it up. Joe Manchin is the real deal my friend. Donald Trump is full of crap. Also "clean coal" is bullshit.
My official statement regarding the incident with Mark Burnett: https://t.co/VRmpT7oPcQ
@DonaldJTrumpJr Everyone feels compassion for your wife. She married into a family of racist grifters &amp; you cheated on her with a contestant from dad‚Äôs crap reality show. Now she raises 5 kids while her husband uses her when needed, like today, parties with his girlfriend &amp; supports Fascist Dad.
@NetflixStandup Guys even the Secret Service knew how to get ahold of me through my manager yesterday.
@Maser7757 @beth2_k3a @jgkight61 @SecretService @POTUS @kathygriffin Geez i hope you aren‚Äôt advocating violence against anyone because trust me the Secret Service had their hands full today.

@parscale bullshit..you are the analytical genius
@sidrosenberg "I'm the furthest thing from a conspiracy theorist" The first line of every crazy conspiracy theory. That's why they are called conspiracy theories &amp; not facts &amp; the idiots that tweet them don't realize how incredibly on the head crazy they look &amp; if they are also media dangerous

@ddale8 @BrokeAssStuart Thanks MGM &amp; Mark Burnett!!!!
@maggieNYT @yashar I got a better one for Doocy
@ezesgirl1 Hypocritical right? Mark Burnett sits next to Donald Trump at pray breakfast. Talks to him 3 times a wk. Made $300 million from Trump. Plus inauguration $ Even though Burnett came into US "Illegally" &amp; got paid "illegally" &amp; broke Fed law he won't stand up for immigrants? #Coward
@IronStache @BrokeAssStuart @realDonaldTrump @BryanSteilforWI Send Mark Burnett. He owes the Federal Government a hundred million dollars and the world a huge apology. He's also got a pretty good choke hold. His wife will lie for him too. I don't know why that would be necessary but I had to type it because it's so insane Roma Downey did it
He wants more nukes. Mark Burnett is still covering up his incompetence because Burnett was an undocumented immigrant who took cash under the table &amp; Trump is covering for Burnett because he‚Äôs white. #ThHuntForTheTrumpTapes https://t.co/FT3ueVcpKQ https://t.co/0PoTESn8GL

@TomOrtenberg Even soap opera actors have enough self awareness to not to eat out in public for a while after they fake rape &amp; murder someone on TV.

@TomOrtenberg No but this is the guy that definitely wants to get body slammed
@Miller50502 @kathy_markovich @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm married weirdo
@ChatByCC @SecretService Its just a body slam so no need to wake up anyone. Trump gets story credit on this episode.He set it all up this week on stage in Montana when he said he loves guys who body slam &amp; he wants to get some too. It‚Äôs more sumo wrestling for us two lard asses at this this point anyway.
@GeorgePapa19 Be sure &amp; give your thoughts about the Republicans Party‚Äôs many faults too. Don‚Äôt want people to think you‚Äôre one sided. Remind them Barrak Obama was your hero.

@SethAbramovitch Please don't tell me @WME has the rights #AriEmanuel

@RonanFarrow they've still got $250 million from Softbank which MBS owns &amp; yes I'm mad Ari wouldn't let the agent with Burnett give a statement to the cops about him attacking me because he's mad I did an episode about trump &amp; Miss Universe but I got these women's backs..the soft bank is real
@JuddApatow @GOP @swingleft @RockTheVote Trump buddy Ari Emanuel has $650 million of the murderer MBS money. WME is owned by the murderer. Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA are owned by the murderer &amp; only person Ari Emanuel has commented about negatively in public since WME client Donald Trump ran for Potus is ME!
@benshapiro be more specific...get in there..this is how you shine...seriously Ben......how fucked up is this??? Use your words @benshapiro take a fucking risk. You don't want to be Kanye anyway. Be Ben Shapiro Go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@simonamangiante @LouiseMensch @GeorgePapa19 @ScottMStedman @20committee OMG...23:46...üëç

@benshapiro Your other dad &amp; me were talking &amp; we want your tuition money back
@AriEmanuel man up! @washingtonpost reporter was slaughtered by @WME $650 million business partner MBS. You've been a coward until now. Covering up for friend's @realDonaldTrump &amp; @MarkBurnettTV sex assaults: Miss USA,Teen USA &amp; Miss U. WME agent SG with Burnett when assaulted me
@VanityFair @gabrielsherman same words Mark Burnett made MGM CEO Gary Barber email Jason Hirschhorn &amp; MGM board about any negative comments about Trump .After Trump admin assisted 2017 MGM sale Burnett pushed Barber out "I'm the most powerful man in Hollywood.

@SuperAndrea Not fair. Side effect of debilitating ‚ÄúHot Ones‚Äù injury
@jjobie123 @wearesuperman @LTRaceSeries Give me 2 steps for that goal
@_IrrelevantNews @karin_michell3 I‚Äôm an actor. Play versions of myself occasionally. Trump isn‚Äôt an actor. He plays himself in everything. He cannot be controlled because he feels no shame or sense of purpose. He‚Äôs a narcissist. It is always about him. He talks a lot so all you have to do is listen.Its shocking.
@thedailybeast of course he did.....it's worse than I imagined
@MattShea @the8bitwarriors @juffapork @coma_xe she's taken but I'll put you on the list:) She is very cool if I don't say so myself.

@simonamangiante hahahaha "I apologize for being too good to be true" damn that is wicked:):)
@secupp @SenWarren Sorry. Didn't realize there was a zero mistake policy for Democrats. We'll just give up and let the world end. Thank you!!!!
@MichaelAvenatti #RawDogPresident
@maxwelltani @thedailybeast @swin24 Don't forget about the $250 million WME got from Softbank which MBS has a big stake in. That brings Ari Emanuel's total MBS money to $650 million.@maxwelltani
@doctorcherokee Trump has that effect on people. Koi too. We‚Äôll be better after he resigns in a few
@maxwelltani @thedailybeast @swin24 Buddy!!!
@fastjeffy78 Not from sodomy. Also you live in eastern Iowa. Not much big game to be scared of son.
@Roodouglas1 @BettyAnnRoyal1 @The_RealCheeto @DonaldJTrumpJr I bet Jr does
@JohnnyGaijin I am. On satellite talking to New Zealand. Did you know it‚Äôs tomorrow today there?
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is why Ari Emanuel is talking to @thedailybeast about his business partner brutal murderer &amp; fellow Trump buddy Saudi prince WME partner MBS #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes 10:30p @VICELAND @washingtonpost https://t.co/aVa6lljjBw
First Mark Burnett. Last week I asked Ari Emanuel to say something publicly that wasn‚Äôt in line with his pervert client Miss Universe host @realDonaldTrump #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes Ari Emanuel/WME/Miss Universe Tapes episode got results.All new #MichaelCohenTapes 10:30p @VICELAND https://t.co/TMgd3M62Sp
@thedailybeast @maxwelltani @swin24 Good work brother @maxwelltani

@DonaldJTrumpJr before you dig in too deep for @realDonaldTrump below seems like your kind of thing. Feel free to retweet. Long story short: You dad &amp; Bin Laden were buddies. Holy crap. You were a child so how could you know? Well, you know now. Make a deal like @IvankaTrump did https://t.co/OKm0OZi2EE
I'm expecting quite a few apologies from people in the UK who said I was the out of my mind bat sh*t crazy one when I appeared on Piers Morgan's Live Good Morning London or whatever Breakfast Show. #ApologyAccepted #OnwardandUpward #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes Tues 10:30p @VICELAND
@discjunkie @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump these people don't do "love"...Don Jr is on a retainer
@blewis823 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump anyone got that video handy?
@AndeyR @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump must be because I've got a lot of Trump's loser trolls asking me stupid questions
@DonaldJTrumpJr Men in your family sure love to bully women. Serious question @DonaldJTrumpJr did you even defend your mother when she said your dad raped her? @realDonaldTrump
@MattShea @the8bitwarriors @juffapork @coma_xe hahaha....might do a thing on my show about some of the characters out here...we are having some laughs..TY...and never bad mouth Ellen. She will murder you. Then her fans will. Then they dance on your grave. Spread the word. They might've gotten to your boy Ninja...#Fortnite ‚ù§Ô∏è
@hankgreen still if he's in town probably ok if I drove over &amp; got in his face...where is he?
@whoisciv sure looks that way today.
@benshapiro hasn't he invited you to the Oval Office yet??? Keep at it. No one can ever say you didn't do your part.
@Jah44H @DannyZuker @sternshow @slansky You'd be the worst because no one likes you. Even Trump hates suck ups.
@the8bitwarriors @juffapork @coma_xe @MattShea you win
@LincolnsBible @THR How creepy that MBS owns part of Miss Teen USA????
@michaeljknowles When I was on @FoxNews set with you &amp; @benshapiro there were 2 young women commentators. They were smart &amp; funny &amp; they would straight up kick you &amp; Ben's butt's in any sort of fight. One had 8" on you fellas. I grew up in Iowa &amp; worked on farms with farm girls. They'd kill you..
@THR same words Ari's other client Donald Trump used. Ari &amp; WME just lost Cosby &amp; Roseanne reruns so he can't afford to lose Trump.
Saudi prince &amp; murder suspect MBS gave Ari Emanuel $400 mill I made this vid for MBS. I want Donald Trump Backstage Miss Universe,USA &amp; Teen USA Tapes he bragged about on Howard Stern. Brave contestants came forward #TheHuntForTheTrumpTapes Trump threatened . Ari didn‚Äôt help MBS? https://t.co/UurOa8J4bw
@yashar MBS now owns Miss Universe/USA/Teen USA backstage tapes Trump bragged about on Stern. Bugging Ari Emanuel/WME 2 yrs for those tapes or for him to speak out once against his client/buddy Trump. WME fired me &amp; banned agents from giving statements about Burnett attack but I'm alive.
@DavidKlion @4lisaguerrero Trump doesn't want any part of her brothers. I know these guys. They will find &amp; confront him &amp; if he doesn't stop bullying their little sis they'll beat him down. Trump must've thought they were dead like Obama's family when he started that racist conspiracy theory for his cult.
@tomcampbellchm I get it some writing a script or when I was on strike at the meat packing plant or building a fort with my kids or standing up for someone or something I believe in. Myself too. I do love &amp; need the solitude &amp; oneness with this amazing universe that comes from true runners high.
@Olivianuzzi @RyanLizza So he's talking to Bannon again?
@clayrr Caillou is banned from my home because  Caillou is the devil &amp; a whiny little big headed boy like Donald Trump. Donald Trump is the Caillou of presidents. There's not even enough there there to fill out the frame.
Love the way this man thinks. Embrace the journey. Find joy in the struggle. That's where I live. Every day. Keep my head up &amp; eyes open because who knows what's going to happen. That's living my best life. I hear too much from elites about winners &amp; losers. Anything is possible. https://t.co/OcrKbOqMZI
@benshapiro and you're trying to take over Don Jr's account...you go boy!!!
@michaeljknowles You're either pregnant or you're not. Trump owe her a million dollars
@TheOnion If you know this family you know this is the only way Don Sr would ever truly respect Don Jr
@DonaldJTrumpJr Dude, you told friends you were pretty sure Eric wasn't your dad's kid at all so might want to take it down a notch. @DonaldJTrumpJr
@skulesa9527 @DavidCornDC Yes and everyone that supports him now knows it so it's on them too. They all go when he does. Vote Nov 6..Mueller Nov 7...I'm doing my small part too
@P_Jarolimek @Robeno @mileskahn @yashar Then get off your butt &amp; do something about it. I didn't always have this great life. Takes work buddy
@thejasonporter @ScottCheshire @kenklippenstein who didn't fart?
@Patrick13487505 @PSheppardTV 2nd worst idea ever:)
I bet people called Lady Gaga a diva too when she was 2 1/2 &amp; made her daddy &amp; brother stay up all night to get her Frozen video just right...and those people would be right but what options do Jax &amp; I really have? We told her it was bedtime.  Nevertheless she persisted.‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/7JVdTe6Eg2
@realDonaldTrump so dangerous because he seems almost normal but his serious mental health issues allow him to believe his lies &amp; be incapable of introspection, admit mistakes or apologize. He‚Äôs always smarter than anyone or information &amp; gets cruel &amp; bullies when questioned.#25A https://t.co/BoeqxPic4l
@JMAN23SD @In2HotH2O Since Donald Trump is the biggest loud mouth of all of us I know you agree we‚Äôve got to get to the bottom of his treasonous &amp; other criminal activities against the United States of America. Welcome to the Resistance!
@AnonyMouse_0099 @GeorgePapa19 üñïüèΩ
@yashar He‚Äôs the Ted Cruz of Saudi Arabia
@pattonoswalt I‚Äôm telling you. She‚Äôs the one that got away..Lady Di because she wouldn‚Äôt  have anything to do with him &amp; now she suffers for eternity, out of focus &amp; earshot of her one unrequited love, Gerald R Ford. She‚Äôd still rather do purgatory than Trump.
@brucks_e you could never piss me off that was called having fun. I don't get mad on twitter
If you watched  #60Minutes &amp; don‚Äôt see Trump has several blaring character defects any of which will end the world you are a member of his cult. Kevin Ulrich, Mark Burnet says you have to power to allow us to see the game changing full Trump Apprentice Tapes. Help America now MGM
@PhilipRucker @yashar chide like "hey bro. you literally butchered a human being. Brutal!" "hahahaha $$$"
@BillyLang17 @jbillinson who cares its fucking cool!
@DEADLINE no way those two guys are buddies....somethings fishy
@kenklippenstein I guess Princess Diana really did want to date Trump after all...
@Tigerhawk3380 @wrongheaded iowa, right?
@Tigerhawk3380 @wrongheaded yes
@4boysnanny maybe I could take Hillary down from retirement...and then she'd be forced to become president since she won anyway

@Cjaro_cakelady @rgoodlaw They are a cult. That is not hyperbole. They are a cult. @RealDeanCain is part of the cult for instance. He gaslights anyone who reasons with him &amp; he wasn't always like this. Reminds me of someone else I once knew.
@marcmorehouse Good lord don‚Äôt get that desperate. I‚Äôm not on Mars
@yashar Bet he never said MBS had an ugly wife tho
@RealDeanCain @tarastrong Sounds like you‚Äôre full of shit. Tara is a saint
@jessesingal @benshapiro Got a f-ing problem with that????
@yashar MBS owns @WME so their social media peeps must be helping. Wonder if Ari Emanuel has a comment about @washingtonpost journalist murdered by his buddy MBS Saudi agents? Or his complicit client @realDonaldTrump?  Not all bad @VICE CEO‚Äôs agent.Mine til I badmouthed Trump @AriEmanuel
@chrismoorewales @realDonaldTrump Haha..i meant British because you were being a d..British? :):) If you were a nob from Alabama i was gonna raise heck
@chrismoorewales @realDonaldTrump Soon my brother
@yashar MBS gave Ari Emanuel $400 million for Miss Universe, USA &amp; Teen USA so no one could see tapes of bud Donald Trump‚Äôs bragged about illegal backstage behavior. Kevin Ulrich &amp; Mark Burnett continue to cover up for Trump at MGM/Apprentice so it‚Äôs pretty impressive I got #TrumpTapes

@MVPenergy 2 films about my life bub
@jdfaganjr @andrewjrivers They only care  what‚Äôs on tape plus Trump said the word was not in his vocabulary. The incompetence on tape is the thing that will affect chance. Trump repeats bullet points &amp; buzz words Apprentice producer gives him just like he does in WH. He‚Äôs Incapable of critical thinking
@wilkyfain @KennethWReid Hear that Ken, I‚Äôm not god..sorry buddy I know you were counting on meüôè
@andrewjrivers No but who cares about them? Seeing Trump say 7 ‚Äún‚Äù words during one day on Trump Tower Apprentice set might convince NFL owners he has no moral authority about players kneeling
