@howlintwolf nice!  I'll call Glen and make it happen.
@howlintwolf nice!  Yeah, check out @western_rise - a outdoor apparel brand, but that's where the logo should be headed.
@howlintwolf less cartoonish and more modern minimalist art.  Good clean font/colors (of colors blue/green with black). That would be great
@howlintwolf totally...  But the colors could easily be adapted.  I just think the general direction of this rebrand is where we should be.

BREAKING- Republicans first order of business is to ban all pre marital sex in the US.  Next up is drilling/fracking the national parks.
Colorado residents, do you like your state?  Think it's a beautiful place to live?  Won't be for long, thanks to your votes.
Wow...  I'm ashamed to be a Colorado resident, tonight. Here's to several years of regression.
Big HAPPY BIRTHDAY to this beauty, tcc1178! http://t.co/dlWsfoyOsC

Is it weird that I have a major crush on @GameOfThrones #roseleslie?
Commentating, however is still awful. On the live extra, of course
Ski #halfpipe looks terrible, due to hammering snow. Ouch
Know this may be awkward for some, but @saxxunderwear makes the best underwear ever. Seriously check them out.
@Kikipowa wait...  Since when?
Shouldn't ski jumpers be able to do more corks than #slopestyle snowboarders/skiers by now?  #Sochi2014
Done with hashtags...  $tags are now in. Just FYI.
Thanks @jonnglass for making me famous in your @SnowboardMag post!  Haha
@GameOfThrones @KaitlynFarr -  wow!  That's amazing!
I LOVE when writers who aren't snowboarders, or have never snowboarded, get to write articles that are published, about snowboarding.
So happy for @KaitlynFarr @TorahBright @Kellyclarkfdn and @hannahteter for their riding today in that challenging pipe!
Ha, and called the podium yesterday!  #snowboarding #halfpipe #Sochi2014 #Olympics
HOLY SHIT @KaitlynFarr WON THE @NBCOlympics!  AWESOME!!!
@TorahBright SO much style.
Great 2nd run @TorahBright, should be good enough for 3rd, maybe 2nd?
Awesome 2nd run from @KaitlynFarr!  Cleaner than first, should be a better score.
Dying, listening to this hack on @NBCOlympics live online commentator for #snowboard #halfpipe.
@TorahBright SICK start to the run.  You'll get it next one!  That run was going to be insane.
@q_castellet with a MASSIVE BS 9!  That was rad.
Great first run for @hannahteter too!  Clean it up next run and you'll be good.
@KaitlynFarr with a SOLID first run!
Come on @TorahBright @KaitlynFarr &amp; @Kellyclarkfdn!
@NBCOlympics - Your snowboard online announcer is AWFUL.  Seriously.
@scottylago would have made a more interesting #olympichalfpipe event!
Okay, let's see if this works again...  Podium I'd like to see -   @TorahBright, @KaitlynFarr, @Kellyclarkfdn : in no particular order
I love when people think the #olympics are the "greatest event ever" for snowboarding.  Truth is, it's just the most publicized, globally.
Can't wait to see how @TorahBright and the girls handle the #halfpipe at @NBCOlympics
@h2ojewel btw, liked your pun about the pipe event looking "fishy"  ha
@h2ojewel - glad you noticed, too
@Jonathan_Weaver - I picked 2 of the 3.
The really sad part, If you know snowboarding, EVERYONE was holding back tonight at @NBCOlympics #halfpipe
@NBCOlympics - #halfpipe was actually legit placing.  Good work judges.
Shaun. Shouldn't win #gold with that one
#Hirano!  That was a MAN run!
I love that even though @theDDeadshow fell, he STILL had a huge smile on his face!  #Haller, too!  #snowboarding
@iouriamazing with a perfect #yoloflip!  Nice work bud.
@MatthewBick RIGHT???  He's terrible!
To clarify, NOT @btoddrichards, but the online commentator.
@NBCOlympics - You're online commentator for #halfpipe is terrible.  I'd like to help you guys next time in S. Korea.  Okay?  Great.
Uh oh... Shaun fell... NBC must be losing their minds!
Not sure I agree with his score... @NBCOlympics #Hirano
#hirano with a bit of a bobble...  But still an amazing run
DAMNIT!!!!  @theDDeadshow was having an awesome run!
Hmm...  @iouriamazing should have had a better score there.
Sick run @iouriamazing!  Big and smooth!
Yeah @gregbretzz, you'll get it next run.
Looks like China could use a new #halfpipe coach...  @jjthomas_ you should help em out!
@ErikHyndman that's fine, and agree.  But if it's the MOST publicized event then they should have the BEST facilities on the planet
@ErikHyndman blah... They can, just won't. And Shaun will ride even if everyone boycotts because he doesn't care about the greater good.
Ooooohhhh weeeeeee, men's #halfpipe about to start @NBCOlympics.
#olympic podium I would like to see -   @theDDeadshow, @iouriamazing , #ayumuhirano.  Boom, I said it
Hey #snowboarders at @NBCOlympics - shut up already, or actually boycott!  It only works if you stand together.  Even if Shaun doesn't.
@JeffPassan - yeah, you're doing very well. Just don't throw anyone under the bus, like those other HACKS and you'll be fine.
@JeffPassan - great work on your Olympic columns!  Glad someone over there actually did his homework on sport and culture.
http://t.co/k5PyMQUogr  Too bad it'll never happen because of one person...
Okay okay, I'll judge the next #olympics #Halfpipe I'll make sure there's no questions about scores, either.
Omg #hipsters have infiltrated #figureskating in the @NBCOlympics   Hahaha
Seems to be a lot of heated articles about #Olympic #snowboarding.  A lot of writers weighing in with NO knowledge of the sport or culture.
Hey @lasportiva  You guys are assholes http://t.co/Q0b6eo3H5G
BEST UNDERWEAR EVER!!!!   http://t.co/vCuAaBWNRz @saxxunderwear
Called it...  @theDDeadshow with the win!
@theDDeadshow wins @xgames with that run
@gregbretzz should be in 1st, @XGames
