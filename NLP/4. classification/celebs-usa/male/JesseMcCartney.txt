Bourdain?! Not Bourdain! He was the reason I fell in love with food. The reason I learned how to cook! I so admired his sense of freedom &amp; ability to call things as he saw them. He was a connection point to the rest of the world. And that connection is now gone. Deeply saddened.

(6/6) For the writers, musicians, photographers, marketers. And especially for this super moody photo you guys....love you, -Jess #Thankful #Thanksgiving
(5/6) For my parents, and siblings, girlfriend, and best friends, managers, lawyers, agents, and fans. For my band, my home, my dog, and my bed.
(4/6) ...who have supported me for years. I’ve watched my friends and family turn new corners and start new chapters in their lives. My life is full. My days have been rich. I’m feeling grateful for all of you.
(3/6) I’ve been able to share my stories and thoughts through a collection of songs that I’ve been working on for some time. I’ve been able to tour some of the greatest schools in our country and perform music old and new for an amazing group of dedicated fans...
(2/6) With all that’s going on in the world, it’s been emotional, scary, romantic, hopeful, and especially creative. I’ve had a chance to travel, write and meet new people.
(1/6) Here’s a picture of me “reflecting.” Really, I’m just finding an eye-line through these really cool blinds we thought would look good in a photo. But the truth is, I have been feeling a bit reflective this week. This year has been very interesting for me. https://t.co/mdp5eX4m1D
