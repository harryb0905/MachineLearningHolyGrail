@littlelaughters new years eve show on float @ marina bay!
That was actually really fun I didn't know what to expect - to those of you who bought tickets and tipped thank you!!! So surprised!!!
Here we go!
@firqhaandjani ahh - i see. why is this so hard :(
@firqhaandjani when you select "buy ticket" it gives you two options. 1. credit card 2. paypal
@firqhaandjani maybe you can try just paying with credit card and not using paypal. i believe that is an option.
@firqhaandjani you can also pay directly with a credit card - without PayPal
@firqhaandjani it is - used highly in America and other countries.
@firqhaandjani what's wrong with PayPal?
@veGh4 yeah it's just like that - different website - http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
Shaving live on @stageit tomorrow after I perform - raising money for hurricane sandy relief. Arrreeeeeba! http://t.co/YFYiUDfy
@supaangelaa_E3 oh.. i see what you were saying hah.
@supaangelaa_E3 so you just need to buy notes with a credit card or paypal - then you can get the ticket. notes are just a weird name for $$
@yukaJP and finally purchase 'notes' which are what Stageit uses for money - get notes and get my ticket - it's easy
@yukaJP Stageit uses paypal - so you need to set up a free account with paypal, then you can link any credit card or bank account
@yukaJP the show link is http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
@Aqidahhhh and i'm shaving my beard during the show for charity. boom.
@Aqidahhhh i have a show tomorrow you can watch - it's ONLINE :) http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
@_aineee then buy 'notes' which are what Stageit uses for money - when you buy notes - you use those to get my ticket.
@_aineee they use paypal - so you need to set up a free and easy account - link a credit card or bank account
@_aineee http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
@nevershoutmayie show link is http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
@nevershoutmayie then buy 'notes' which are what Stageit uses for money - buy notes then use them to buy my ticket.
@nevershoutmayie Stageit uses paypal - so you have to set up a free and easy account - then link a credit card or bank account
@dearlalaaa also Stageit uses "notes" as money - so you have to purchase 'notes' first and then use them to buy my ticket.
@dearlalaaa they use http://t.co/56ZmrnIR, it's free and easy to set up an account and you can link it with any credit card or bank account.
i'm also sick so i might be coughing through the show tomorrow, but you know what? who cares... you know what else? so what. #showgoeson
If you want to watch the ONLINE show tomorrow, all you need is an internet connection &amp; a ticket. if you need help getting tix let me know.
the top tipper tomorrow will get a personal phone call from me too
@athennamaine i'm gonna be on Stage it doing a show - tix here - gonna bring the laptop in the bathroom http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
i'm literally gonna bring the laptop into the bathroom and shave for 10 minutes or however long it takes to shave.
i've been through a few storms in NYC, nothing like sandy, but they always bring the city together, and I'm sad i couldn't be there.
so let's do it, get your tix for the show and then you can watch me play songs (set list?) and shave my face, hah http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
@WuanShyuan yes that's correct
and i wanted to find a way to help while I'm out of NYC, so I want to donate, and do something fun / funny to make it happen. #KPSANDYSHAVE
it means something to me because I live in NYC and being here in Asia seeing photos and videos and not being there has been heartbreaking
so yeah - i'm gonna shave my "beard" tomorrow during my show, maybe as the encore, and you guys tip me then WE'LL donate all the tips, yeah?
@anggiedp09 i have one tomorrow ONLINE that you can watch from ANYWHERE :) http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
so instead of shaving it before the show - i may shave it during the show for charity - all tips during my shaving go to Sandy Relief
so i want to donate some proceeds from my show tomorrow to Hurricane Sandy Relief, I was thinking how to do that...and i have facial hair...
you purchase "notes" to come see the show. 10 notes equals 1US Dollar. alot of questions coming in...need help buying?
For those of you that don't know @Stageit is an Online Show where you buy tix to come to an exclusive online hang where I play and we chat..
@Starkiller00 I'm playing the NYE countdown at the float at marina bay!
Everybody in Jakarta i love you and if you wanna catch a show i'm playing one you can watch, TOMORROW. only 5 tix left http://t.co/wAMJuC3z
