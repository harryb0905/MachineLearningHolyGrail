“@KDTrey5: Welcome back @derekfisher” appreciate it
“@RonnieBrewerJr: Congrats @derekfisher joining the Thunder. #ArkansasBoyz reunited” thanks home team
He forever changed my life. May he rest in peace and my prayers are with his family that he loved so much. #RIPDrBuss
Today the world lost a visionary and one of the most successful sports figures of all time. But today I lost a friend and mentor.
Heard rumors I'm angling for Executive Director. There are people out there better suited for that role than me. No thanks. Not interested.
Yet it surely should remind us of how far we still have to go as a nation. Congrats Prez O, Happy MLK Day to all. God bless, keep dreaming.
Amazing to think of how far our nation has come to have an inauguration for 2nd term of our 1st African American President on MLK Day today.
I won't close the possibility that I will play again, however, for now my family &amp; being close to them remains the priority.
My family is my priority and that is where I choose to be.
I have made decisions in the past, leaving money &amp; opportunity on the table, &amp; I will need to do that again.
From Mark, to Coach Carlisle, to the players on the Mavericks team, I sincerely thank them for the opportunity.
Mark Cuban has been extremely supportive and has granted me this request.  I cannot say enough good things about this organization.
With this news &amp; the difficulty I have been having being away from my family I have asked the organization to waive me so I can return home.
In Tuesday's game against Philadelphia I suffered an injury to my patellar tendon.  The recovery time will be approximately 2 weeks.
Thank you #Cowboys for having me at the game! Glad to be in #Dallas! #GoCowboys http://t.co/2A0jg5fT
I look forward to joining my new teammates, the Mavericks organization and contributing everything I can to play a part in a great season!
I am very excited to join the Dallas Mavericks! I believe this team has the potential to contend with the best teams in the league.

I'd love to play, but no plans to given my schedule of meetings and my lead role in them.
My first priority is serving as President of the NBPA. Everything else comes as a far second right now.
While I fully support the Impact League and all the players, I have NOT committed to playing, nor can I at this point.
Just getting out of our PA meetings. Wish that people would check facts before writing stories.
We want to go back to work.
While the reports of my texts are false, I will say that I have & will continue to urge our players to stay ready for a season.

I am confident I will continue to lead this team on and off the court.  Let the hunt for six begin...   Derek
While this may not be the most lucrative contract I've been offered this off season, it is the most valuable.
I have decided to continue with Kobe, continue with our teammates and the fans of Los Angeles.
We have won five championships together.
He & I have played together for 11 seasons, came into the league together as kids, & has been loyal to me even when others had doubts.
At the end of the day, there's one person I could not turn away from.  Kobe Bryant asked me to stay but supported whatever decision I made.
I listened to every coach, every general manager, even potential teammates in order to make the right decision & I thank every one of them.
Numbers reported were guesses & true "sources" were few & far between.I took time to consider all my options, many not reported in the media
and determine what new goals I want to achieve in the future.  Many reports were completely false.
My free agency was a time for me to reevaluate my position in the league, reflect on my accomplishments individually and as a teammate,

This is the 1st and last in game Twitter! I appreciate you all and GO LAKERS! Goodnight!!!
I'm so proud of the team.  They responded like champions and that is what this is all about.  WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP. Great job guys!
Close the game out. Make free throws, don't give up any 3s, and don't foul
3 minutes to go.  Defense and rebound.
@tangielawschool thanks
We are where we want to be but we have to rebound the ball.
@shirleyodette thanks
@jhen775162 looking forward to it
Couldn't ask for a better 3rd qtr from the guys! Up 12 going to the 4th qtr on the road is a good place to be! Finish the job fellas!!!
@stanleyshmanley appreciate that
Have to finish the quarter strong.  Increase this lead.
@liujz no
@isaiahyoon ball handling, ball handling, ball handling. No matter what position u want to play, improving that will do wonders for ur game
@EddieDT thanks for for the support
@Bay408Mike thanks man
Really good start to the half. We have to stay out of fouls and keep them off the free throw line until later in the 3rd quarter
@LA_FN4EVR sunday
@rblax04 a lot
Here we go...Good aggressive start is key!
@Mike_Tha_illest I think Phil will go to more pick and roll with Yao involved as game goes on.  Great point!
@Ken_Do_ thx
@AKnight24 see you sunday
@Aman_Singh thanks
@FerasZahid you got it
@luvdgs19 you are right, but, can't drive into tight spots and not have passing lanes. Drive, kick to open teammates
@SimplyPatsy there you go...
Lamar will re-establish his impact on game in 2nd half
Great half! To have the lead at the half is really good on the road.  First 3 mins of the 3rd qtr are key.
@timesarrow appreciate it
@AMON14 greatest accomplishment? being drafted honestly! such a long shot to end up being a first round draft pick!
We have to remain composed during this stretch of the game and look to stretch this lead going into the half
@JoeRepuyan watching from the hotel
@saltersl never been suspended before. ever.
@_GiNA_ thx for the support
@DavidDerval thx!
Keep creating turnovers & playing active defense. Shooting most likely won't stay @ 60% so we have to tighten up defense as game progresses.
@chrisSicilia thx
Really solid start for a road playoff game! Kobe set the tone and the guys r responding. They look connected and focused.
@giveandgo thx
@TRUELAKERFan thx
Great hustle by J Farm!  We have to get more defensive stops!
We're up 13 to 5. Kobe is on fire! Great start for the guys!
la 12 / hou 4
Since I can't be @ the arena, I'll be here with you guys, the fans, as I watch! I'll tweet on time outs, commercials, etc & weigh in. GO LA!
