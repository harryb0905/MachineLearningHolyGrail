Today more than ever we hope his hopes, dream his dreams, and thank God for his courage. Thank you Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   #MLKDAY2019
His words inspired a nation, empowered a people, broke down walls of hate, and shattered chains of injustice. They will echo through history and our children's children will live in a better world because of the life of Dr. King.

Wanted to address the video circulating from Sunday: I’ve known @NdamukongSuh since his college days and he’s a close friend of mine. Quality as a person matches his quality as a player.   That video is just a friend clowning with another friend. No negative intent! It's all love

@MikeLeach82 O sure Mr Kinloch
@julie_leach @CardsMarkD @aqshipley @AZCardinals Julie tell Mike to get you one also. You let him play unlimited golf would be a fair trade. Tell Maddy and Ryan hello for me.
@aqshipley @AZCardinals Getting a new contract after a season ending injury is rare no doubt @aqshipley kudos to the @AZCardinals. But more then anything its further validation of what you represent as a 1st rate man and teammate. Now go get that tiffany's tennis bracelet you showed us for your wife.
I couldn't stop laughing at this video @Go_10_ but 1st off you used the white voice from "Sorry to Bother You" which is appalling. Smh. 2nd you used I or me 22 times which I would never do in an interview. Tighten up youngin https://t.co/MWTZq3NJbk

@lisacoelho @NFLonFOX @AZCardinals Only if I had your skill I could make something out of myself. Hope you and your family are well Lisa. Hope to see you this season on the sidelines!!!
@BounceBootCamp @AzCardsYouth T Hill I love the kids!!!
@ChristianDavon2 Focus on the positives lil bro. The 1st time you touched the ball as a pro you damn near housed it. Huge play for us tonight and you will have plenty more opportunities.
@AZCardinals The 1st love was over for the night so I turned to another one of my many passions. After that I was a cheerleader for my guys who were finishing the game.
@JonRahmpga @Fehertwit @GolfChannel It was fun @JonRahmpga always enjoying getting to hang with you. I didn't enjoy losing that money to you before the show was filmed. Shooting 62's on your friends is just wrong on so many levels. Lol

@kentsomers That was my 1st stop in January, but Shaelyn said he couldn't play anymore. She said it’s because he is practicing for the 2022 winter games to compete in mens freestyle skiing competition. Had to respect his commitment!
Despite Sweden’s frosty climate, the people there have a warmth about them that is truly special: Whether I was dogsledding in the frigid North, driving a supercar across the frozen tundra, or walking the streets in Stockholm, the locals made me feel very welcomed. @NomadHill https://t.co/nm1RtupJyj

Look at my guy @kobebryant, he inspired for over 20 years on the basketball court and now he continues to do so on a new court. He keeps leading by example and continues to knock down doors by rising to the occasion in the biggest moments. #Oscars
Dang @Brittany1golf you’re hard on your boy. Lol. We all have our struggles at times. If I had 2 two majors and 8 wins I may have my needle out as well. https://t.co/QCWqYdAii4

Good times last night. Was there doing some scouting for the @suns squad. It would be awesome to have @MB3FIVE come back home and team up with @devinbook. https://t.co/6PbmLaWQqH
Don't fall in love with the numbers as they can be deceiving. When they devise a test that can measure the heart of a player only then can teams not miss(baring injuries of course). https://t.co/LaHUzLt62h
Yes mam it was. https://t.co/LNM2Li0Dyx
That's far too many drops for my liking, still got work to do. What about your 582 passes &amp; 7,848 yards over the past 5 seasons? If I'm not mistaken that's the most by a player in any five year span in NFL history. My friend, that's the standard!!! https://t.co/x49ht5powC
Congrats to @TeamUSA @usacurl on winning the gold medal at the #Olympics! I found out myself it’s not an easy sport. https://t.co/T60zMaAPBk

Exciting day of events at the Pyeongchang mountain cluster. Got excited when I saw the “Phoenix” Snow Park. Lol. Watched the woman's halfpipe medal round &amp; then back to @TeamUSA House to watch other events. The time &amp; effort they put into perfecting their craft is simply amazing! https://t.co/yHPmcKl7be
Nothing planned as of yet, but it's always an option. Do you have any suggestions? https://t.co/6beUdyJddK

You saw how @streels54 was hitting yesterday in the practice round? Well it carried over to today. I chipped in where I could here and there. He's in a pissy mood now though after Duke blew that 15 point lead tonight. https://t.co/HNo4nR8ouB
It was a pleasure to meet you. I hope you have a great week. When you’re in AZ again let's link up! https://t.co/bzt2UdOdKV
Good to hear from you bro, it's been too long. Congrats to you as well, you are the best follow in the business. You keep me laughing!
