Could happen. But zero evidence as yet. So risky assumption.  https://t.co/Hph6LXIP57
If she holds current 483 SuperDs, @HillaryClinton needs just 36% of remaining.  @BernieSanders (31 SD) 77%.  https://t.co/4n4fY242hO
To win w/ JUST pledged, @HillaryClinton would need roughly 69% of remaining. @BernieSanders would need 80% https://t.co/4n4fY242hO
Update: to get to 1,237 before convention, @realDonaldTrump needs 60% remaining delegates @tedcruz needs 88%. #cnnelection
#WI CD-3 still to be allocated. Best @realDonaldTrump will do is 6 delegates. Might be just 3. @tedcruz gets 36, could get 39. #cnnelection

She has 1229 pledged. So needs 1154 or 61% of remaining pledged. (If holds her current Supers -482- drops to 35%)  https://t.co/Vy7nMTPPBh
no subtext. I laid out math and noted how his current supers help. If he gets more, they of course help. #math https://t.co/NXlnWq7TGE
Yes.  https://t.co/Ndqd7JU9Ig
delegate math:@BernieSanders has 925 pledged Ds.1,897 left (142 today) To reach 2,383 needs 1,458 more. (Add his 27 supers, needs 1,431)

#GOPDebate @marcorubio strategy: "Focus on Presidential demeanor--or lack thereof. Humor not anger ...Out of the locker room into the Oval"
there are different state laws/rules that apply, then will be rules adopted for the convention as well.  https://t.co/pGxOfHBhyM
As of today needs 54.2% of remaining.  https://t.co/KZvSwZB1Nl
#GOPDebate stakes: post 3/15, 1,466 (59%) delegates chosen. 1,006 left. @realdonaldtrump # after Tues sets odds of #nevertrump effort.
Stay in, watch debate!  https://t.co/qq8Ocdzclk
Open convention can choose anybody  https://t.co/Vzdg0DUwrS
Possible yes.  https://t.co/sL61UByh1c
Time for cnnsitroom w/ wolfblitzer from #gopdebate hall. #cnnelection #miami https://t.co/sCdQpdHcfK
Deja vu, sort of: @HillaryClinton 2day to @jeffzeleny:   "If we go to the end, we go to the end just like we did in 2008." #CNNElection

But they don't. And he isn't. The rules, as is, and calendar, as is, are going to decide how this goes.  https://t.co/VsRVxviDrd
Yup. I did. And Castro. To say remarkable how politics and dem party have changed in recent years. No rescue. #fact https://t.co/JCSc4QDmGO
Said very. As part of longer answer. But context and Twitter have never met apparently.  https://t.co/PTxIQMpPXU
Not even close to what was said. #yawn  https://t.co/XVC2wKYztT
Hope doing well. Thanks for saying hello.  https://t.co/OmuXeiTvXd
Pleasure. Good to find some #RedSox nation in #Miami  https://t.co/KvQxYmLjcU
She added to her overall lead. Modest gain. But a gain.  https://t.co/yhXoG9o26J
Cruz doesn't want Rubio to be viable choice - now or if open convention.  https://t.co/1wDJT6Hxkp
Huge win. But needs follow up next week to be more than stunning upset and also part of changing math.  https://t.co/lYOvyMagFn
To campaigning for Latino votes. #listen  https://t.co/h54pfHQjDh
Good luck! But enjoy finishing school first.  https://t.co/mguhTtKJ0V
Let's circle back to this Q in June and see what the math is.  https://t.co/YZPxZolvQV
A lot switched from @HillaryClinton to @BarackObama late '08. Possible, but would take major shift in race.  https://t.co/UZSGdUSOWr
Possible, yes. But then those superdelegates some people don't want to talk about would come into play.  https://t.co/ln755gvt2D
Agree  https://t.co/7ufK9RBiZ4
OH polls mixed. But an @JohnKasich win would make open CVN a big Q as we move on to other states. PA MD NY NJ etc  https://t.co/2xAjhz3bQx
Only for my sports teams. #iwish  https://t.co/jx7xOqw9RM
A mix of WTA and proportionals ahead. The big WTAs would make math easier. But not easy.  https://t.co/YpTUU3reXO
So nice to meet and chat.  https://t.co/F9P5qiEXrf
DEM pledged delegate math: needed to clinch.                                     HC: needs 59.1%  BS: Needs 67.0%  This is pledged only
GOP math: % delegates won then % of remaining to clinch   DT: 44.3% needs 54.2%  TC 34.6%  - 61.3%  MR 14.8%  - 75.7 % JK 5.2%  - 82.7%
Yes. Strong #s to your point. But as long as he keeps winning, he keeps amassing delegates.  https://t.co/kug7eulPBC
4 would be downright dreamy.  https://t.co/XEv8A3r8r3
Not hoping anything except to count them all. In a democracy every vote counts. Do you take issue with that?  https://t.co/XmnqjswlmF
TBD #thankstrump  https://t.co/uY30G8sLvL
No. Never. But have fun with it if lying makes you happy.  https://t.co/6tcqOFkDdx
Morning after math: 3/8 GOP delegate haul DT 72 TC 57 JK 17 MR 0 TBD 4. Total 2 date DT 461 TC 360 MR 154 JK 54. (1237 to win) #CNNElection
Morning after math: 3/8 DEM delegate haul: Clinton: 88 Sanders: 72 TBD: 6. Overall Pledged (Supers) HC 766 ( 472) BA 549. (23) #CNNElection
Needed to win 60+ % remaining delegates entering tonight. https://t.co/QQNT1GDKt4
Will prob have to wait post 3/15 but will keep in mind.  https://t.co/lBiLdulnlJ
Yes it would. But two big state losses would sure change the conversation heading forward.  https://t.co/Wpy2TEIQgQ
My math has ZERO supers. Pledged. Only.  https://t.co/I2SKzfv20R
She will end the night ballpark 220 lead in pledged delegates. That is a healthy lead. By any math. On we go.  https://t.co/8lCFUbvFmz
He thinks otherwise. A last alternative standing sort of thing. And would help slow trump.  https://t.co/yJ3fOO8Lm1
I only did pledged.  https://t.co/qPqiuUl5vl
Doubt one will do it. Will watch.  https://t.co/r1M0QO7nXP
alternative? Don't report delegates? Is why they hold primaries? Like sportscaster saying Sox vs Yankees w no score  https://t.co/T4hFU7WUvn
I count votes. He isn't out. Math isn't easy. But let's see if #MI impacts 3/15.  https://t.co/ciquU4E3qy
Never angry. Love that people get passionate about their candidate.  https://t.co/dOrVpLNSnQ
True re delegate math. Next Tues will give us better sense of lasting impact. But a big upset.  https://t.co/pZ0OgObs8S
Favors establishment; favors person winning most. Was an "adjustment" to earlier rules changes.  https://t.co/7ceEOV1c9e
Can I connect you with all the Sanders people trying to send me to Gitmo? #politicsisfun  https://t.co/yYCyZuKg9I
Me, too! Nashville. Wild night.  https://t.co/rIUhaYfuow

I said among as the #nevertrump crowd says ....... #contextmatters  https://t.co/aa0ZdNfzAu
We are in agreement up to last sentence. As long as she keeps winning she will hold them. And  that matters.  https://t.co/LGqE4wh2Oc
Math is biased? Numbers are biased? Sorry - disagree. I am counting. You don't like the math.  https://t.co/FnPHlqLdUE
No doubt she has weaknesses. But if she wins #MI #MS both primary math and demographics heavily her way  https://t.co/HBIcz9BeA3
Can't share any data re voting until polls close. Some broader dynamics released earlier.  https://t.co/fKAcX1rtkc

After 8pE https://t.co/8sLV0hwxT7
After #DemDebate #MI looms large as @BernieSanders looks to boost delegate #s.  https://t.co/oAdOQASabJ @jeffzeleny @mkraju @AshleyRParker
#Ohio &amp; @JohnKasich the other piece of the block @realDonaldTrump math effort. Big 10 days ahead.  https://t.co/VsXwYTqEq3
I'm just getting started later 2nite. I hope!  https://t.co/HZv6VvxSCb
From 2day's #insidepolitics, just @realDonaldTrump speed bump or @tedcruz turning point? https://t.co/UF6B6KV0ha @AshleyRParker @mkhammer
#PuertoRico GOP delegates all 2 @marcorubio making the current @CNN count:           Trump -389 Cruz – 302 Rubio – 149 Kasich - 37
She is +4 for the day at the moment. 13 TBD all but one #LA. So will go up some.  https://t.co/D8JOJT25OP
Person with most delegates wins nomination. The rules choose that "narrative".  https://t.co/K5B2JUcHbP
Today trendline only pledged.  https://t.co/lCgGUHwyVN
Delegate trendline: 20 in #Ky and #la still TBD will determine whether @realDonaldTrump gained or lost a little of edge over @tedcruz
Delegate trendline: @HillaryClinton ends #SuperSaturday w slightly bigger delegate lead over @BernieSanders than she began the day.
Maybe you shouldn't broad brush smear; I don't give any political group or campaign $$.  https://t.co/fE7p7l44ra
See Obama '08.  How it works in Dem prez primaries.  https://t.co/MxDLlNwyjc
Did it long time ago.  https://t.co/q5KVo33kkS
Because we reported 2 wins Sanders 1 Clinton and she leads delegate race. Yup, guilty of that. #fact  https://t.co/C5EEycBr0E
And KS and NE are? A win is a win. And every delegate counts.  https://t.co/qFdTZq9x7f
Both matter. @BernieSanders won 2 states. @HillaryClinton won 1. She began and will end night w delegate lead.  https://t.co/DsqgNgGpP4
Don't have final #s yet. Roughly proportional to results but some math to do.  https://t.co/0dV5fdLd82
Not absolutely. But vvv steep hill which is what we say.  https://t.co/GVy5TN3E3n
He was expected to win #KS and #NE but no one dismissive. Just needs bigger prizes to change delegate arc. Math.  https://t.co/7hWVMNAsWJ
If #ky and #la hold Team Trump can make that case. And then we get a big test #mi #ms Tuesday.  https://t.co/RZZXNgCUHf
And could make same case if U insist re @BernieSanders in #KS #NE. There are two campaigns: primary then Nov.  https://t.co/jYwQEm5WAG
But almost the same path @BarackObama took in '08. And I think he won twice rather big.  https://t.co/jYwQEm5WAG
No bc we don't. We do math.  https://t.co/DVCozhi1ig
Yes. #LA margin makes huge difference.   https://t.co/GBYxQTCrWx

#ne DEM results: 75% counted           @BernieSanders 54 % @HillaryClinton 45%.  #CNNElection #SuperSaturday
Correct #me percentages: @tedcruz 46% @realDonaldTrump 32 @JohnKasich 12% @marcorubio 8%.
Tough map ahead but @tedcruz has at least a #SuperSaturday split - and stronger argument for 2 man race. Bad @marcorubio day so far.
So asking team #magicwall about that #Maine GOP #tbt performance.  #SuperSaturday #CNNElection

V hard yes. Hard for Rubio, too, though if he wins. Steep hill for all non Trump  https://t.co/dnVQm8Tx5X
9 % now. Cruz 43 Trump 37 Kasich 11 Rubio 8 https://t.co/SgkGVz4XGH
Partly cloudy delegate math?  https://t.co/kFQ1m9D7jc
Can't wait. But have to wait because primary calendar kinda busy! They are fun to work with.  https://t.co/abWBQB2zlO
#KY trickling in now. #LA after 9pE.  https://t.co/6LJaWYwpGe
Trying ! 17 candidate start was a challenge.  https://t.co/lCPmN8q2bf
No. But IF swept, would be w/ in 75-80 or so. If Trump wins #KY #LA more likely a 90ish delegate gap. Margins matter https://t.co/M1be4KhAfq
Always.  https://t.co/Uk3ydbHYJx
We can all learn from conversation.  https://t.co/jOlJBpJTw3
Not sure what poll u mean. Saw some data last week Trump +7. Even that a big swing. Why? Debate? Cruz org? Both? https://t.co/pcz2WTRuAY
Yes if continues. More closed contests ahead. Team Trump suggests mostly caucus issue. We shall see  https://t.co/i6bPZ1cNVo
Wants Rubio out. Open CVN more likely to pick MR over TC. All politics is personal.  https://t.co/BXrXZNjZwY
How you doing lad? https://t.co/sfGs1mKh4h

Passion for candidates is good.  Challenging us just fine, too.  https://t.co/vL6D9VlmAc

Not true. More GOP so far because of closing times. But many visits to Dem caucus sites.  https://t.co/Uljb2odCLj
I watched it on air all day. Sorry just wrong.  https://t.co/alpwExptZj
They insist will come back. But if loses to #Trump giant delegate grab and statement. If Cruz would reset the race.  https://t.co/nj9iVB88AW
No, we count. No matter who gets most.But if you are right at least I can go back to college free and retrain.  https://t.co/0KVk0ASBcS

Of course in this crazy year we get @JohnKasich supporter  @Schwarzenegger in the video game commercial in one of the breaks. #gopdebate
The "some flexibility, some negotiation" on immigration concession by @realDonaldTrump will echo some. @tedcruz waiting ... #GOPDebate
First commercial break you think those kids get removed? #GOPDebate
Guessing the @tedcruz prosecuting @realDonaldTrump 4 supporting #DEMs wishes other @tedcruz had skipped months long bromance. #GOPDebate
Chris Wallace, w facts and #s, relentless in challenging @realDonaldTrump "waste, fraud and abuse" &amp; other budget "math" #GOPDebate

that is #nevertrump debate: best 1 on 1 to try stop him, or need MR, JK wins at home? advantage: @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/Kls6U9JZjE
Also, #MI, #MS on 3/8 will speak volumes about @realDonaldTrump resiliency, whether @tedcruz can recover in South. then 3/15 math clearer.
Yes, 3/15 HUGE test for #NeverTrump but this Saturday could bring big earlier hints: #KY #KS #LA #ME #CNNElection #magicwall
