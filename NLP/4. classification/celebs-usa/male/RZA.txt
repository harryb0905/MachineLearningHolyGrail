Being it's a work of art only one copy exist. Just like there is only one "Mona Lisa" one "Statue of Liberty" one "Eiffel Tower".
For clarity. The 88 year clause relates to the commercialization of the album. Meaning it can't be sold or bought only given away.

#ABetterTomorrow  http://t.co/KywRWjllhg
Ok  ok my vent is done. Today wasn't such a good day, maybe I'll take a glass of bourbon my buddy gave me and strive for #ABetterTomorrow
It puzzles me that the brutal behavior inflicted by the men we look to serve and protect us does not affect the hearts of their community
We strive to better ourselves as examples to our family friends community country and maybe world...
My mother also didn't approve of my vulgar violent nature. This caused me to aim for her approval as she was my  greatest love in life...
When I first made albums they were so aggressive &amp; vulgar that my now ex wife wouldn't play it in the house. This made me rethink my energy
We all should respect law and order because that's keeps us civilized without chaos. The problem is who we are appointing to uphold our laws
Old dogmas and myths are hard to detach from when they become accepted as truth. That's like old sailors thinking the world was flat.
It's like sometime it's hard for me to get out of my daily blunt mentality of my youth but in order to improve my self and my family I did.
I'm not saying that this generation has not eradicated racism more than the previous but the ones who hold the  scepter is from previous
This is not a political issue it's a social and even more, a spiritual. How can men with PhDs not have a eye for proper judgement of justice
The  world won't get no better if we just let it be... We have to change it you and me.
I have family and friends who work as policemen and women and they don't condone brutality committed by their peers. They have children...
On our first album the song cream described our condition &amp; we lost friends to police brutality then. Now 20 years later same thing come on
Any true Wu fan should know the title #ABetterTomorrow is far beyond the music on a album it's an actual quest for this generation.
Not advertising striving! Until we all respect each others 12 jewels of life we will never achieve A better tomorrow. But repeat bad history
Even Shaolin is not safe from injustice #BlackLivesMatter we need to work harder for our country and people to achieve #ABetterTomorrow

@blakleo5 @Paco456sun @WuTangClan I hear you bro. Time will reveal.
@maitreyaone culture is a way of life,something one lives not just in word but more so in action. For some artist HipHop is a music hustle
@sophia333gata77 in actuality if we see it how can it be burnt out? Scientist say so yet the constellation has appeared the same for eons.
@KingJesusJesus right means to be correct. It's mathematically accurate. The holder of the sum must be self aware. This is realization.
@maitreyaone how can water really ever be dirty. A lotus grows in such water as sign of its usefulness. The Book say if no water use sand.
@WuTangClan  through our lyrics and music and artistic expressions we strive to inspire "A Better Tomorrow "
People look across seas hills and mountains for help some look to the sky but what about your brother in common right next to you.
Positive outweighs negative thus  light positive energy from the sun moon or star seems to be timeless. We see light millions of years away
Negativity burns itself out just as electricity eventually burns the wire it flows thru. It may take a  xxx years but there is still a end
When each man learns and live out the righteousness of his being he automatically adds to world peace. One must start with self.
There is a lot of injustice against humanity being committed daily around our world. A man's first strive is to keep his home at peace.
@blakleo5  what would you have Us do.Those brothers neighbors are billionaires with trillions of oil reserves &amp; resources. We use our words
@JemTheHuman Peace Jem that's been a 450 year challenge in which I think many generations have proven the value and continue to do so.

@GRAddicts  Good time in Edmonton. The sound system could've been better ,still the mighty Wutang spazzed out, the crowd loved it. Bong bong
Edmonton Canada. Prepare to Enter The Wutang 36 Chambers. Tonight it goes down. Bong
@rodriguezramon is slaying his role. The Ping pong mentality is complex and he plays it convincingly. Can Ryan be trusted #gangrelatedfox
Rocking in Salt Lake City last night while #gangrelatedfox was on the air so I missed it. But I caught up today &amp; yo it's getting super deep
Salt Lake City gets two thumbs up. Last night was crazy. 40k plus holding up that W. Let's keep working towards "A Better Tomorrow" bong
Happy Birthday to Prana Supreme and to our President @BarackObama. May it be a blessed day. Persistence  can overcome resistance.  Bong bong
That was fun. @GRAddicts I'm bummed I got to wait to see it while you guys on the east get in now.
@HoneyOpals I herd that Vee likes chocolate. Lol #gangrelatedfox
@fififolcum #gangrelatedfox  fun fulfilling heathy inspiring knowledgable satisfying experience.
@GRAddicts this has been fun. Thanks for taking it easy. Shout out to @rodriguezramon @sungkang @InbarLavi tonight episode is gonna be deep.
@GRAddicts @Hughes2Society oh oh. Don't make him go menace 2 society on a fool. Lol.
@_TorranceLinton that would be cool. Maybe the writers would find something to make that happen.
@BethBattista1 @GRAddicts ha ha ha. Then what.
@GRAddicts @LadiesLoveKap to the young rapper or actor strive to be original. Stay confident. Persistence can overcome resistance
@ang_jjs @GRAddicts well well well. As the British would say everyone likes a good Shag now and then. actually I may need to clean it up lol
@the7footes @GRAddicts #gangrelatedfox  Family people space and time. Nature and science. All these things inspire art. And of course self
@GRAddicts we  represented ourselves in our own fashion. We didn't cater to the norm. We  stood for the same cause. We made good music.
@RAIDER_ERIC_ #gangrelatedfox  I am waiting for the writers to hook me up with a prime time dime. Lol.
@Lilo_Coockiiies @GRAddicts one of my favorite things about acting is you can put on a persona, live it, then walk away unattached. Healthy
@BethBattista1 @GRAddicts if I had my choice.....oh man.... What a film....
@ang_jjs @GRAddicts Dave is one of the funniest men on the planet. Glad to be living in his generation.
@HoneyOpals I may be artistically schizophrenic....lol.
@Ericrouuseau @GRAddicts @GangRelatedFOX the writers put that in there. Fish scale is a real brand.
@GRAddicts @BethBattista1 #gangrelatedfox  I've been blessed to work with quite a A list. But still never got  to rock with Stevie Wonder.
@lbneighbours @GRAddicts as a kid Mike Tyson. At any age Robert Deniro and Denzel Washington , females like Lucy Liu ,Scarlet J,Paula Patton
@heather_h96 @GRAddicts @GangRelatedFOX  I enjoy both equally they compliment each other artistically and satisfy different hungers.
@KyleKylewhite @GRAddicts on #gangrelatedfox  the music choices are cool from Kendrick  Lamar to Future.I'm a recent fan of @ArcticMonkeys
@isabella_leah @GRAddicts super cast and crew and overall a great group of creative people. The team made getting up early for work easier.
@KyleKylewhite @GRAddicts  the director @Hughes2Society thought it would be a good character for me and my bro Bokeem Woodbine pushed me.
@lkofford @GRAddicts to adapt to the role I spent some time with some law enforcement personnel some where friends some provided by studio.
@Thevfrye74 @GRAddicts #gangrelatedfox  boxers. Although Cassius Green wears Briefs. Lol
@meepmeepjl @GRAddicts growing up. The street sounds of New York Djays and the lyricism of the Gza was my major influences.
@hoistingmysail @GRAddicts Cassius is not self righteous. The writers gave him a back story of a tragic event so he chose law enforcement
It's official #GRAddictsQA #gangrelatedfox I'm open to questions tonight so don't be shy and splash me with your inquiries.
