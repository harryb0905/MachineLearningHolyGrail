Just saw a tomato growing out of a gutter in LA. As Dr. Malcom would say, "Life, uh, finds a way"... :)
Em is a part of a new musical improv troupe called @GirlGroupShow. They're really funny. Following them is a good idea. :)
I started playing Backgammon. ...and it rocks. Me and Em are just trying to seal the deal- being old people.
BTW - Em and I grew them in our backyard.  http://t.co/4i0OUoP

If you're looking to download "Baby"- search for Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure on iTunes.
I covered Justin Beber's - "Baby" and it's on iTunes right now! It's worth it just to hear me do the whitest rap probably ever recorded.
Just auditioned for Hairspray at the Hollywood Bowl. So nerve racking... Glad it's over.
I had to say no... I didn't want them to damage my HSM wallpaper.
Someone just knocked on my door asking to use my house for a Bocat Goldthwait movie... Never thought THAT would happen.
Shot a Funny or Die video with Matthew Morrison today. So much fun.
I'm also about to release a NEW VIDEO I've been working on for the last couple of weeks. I'll let you know ASAP when and where to find it!
On my way to the recording studio again.  Singing one of my own today. Cant wait for you guys to hear it.
Janet is hot.
Just left the recording studio... Hint hint, you'll hear it in June.
Happy Birthday Charlie Chaplin.
Just got popped at the chiropractor. It was awesome... Wait, that didn't sound good. You know what I mean.

So great to see most of the HSM gang last night. I missed you guys! Great job @ashleytisdale!
I just wrapped on set. Hurray, that means I'm headed to the premiere of Sharpay's Fabulous Aventure with @ashleytisdale.
The carrots were from my garden. I also ground wheat to make the flour. Family recipe. Yum.  http://t.co/CQv5dEF
Eating carrot cake at 12:15... It's a new diet thing I'm doing...

Just left ABC Family - shooting a Channel One Pop Quiz promo with my fellow Switched At Birth actor, Vanessa Marano. http://t.co/Pbv0mw2
Just finished shooting an interview for a documentary about how technology has changed the film and music industries. Really fun.
I almost kissed the fedex guy today... He finally delivered my iPad2.
Just finished a photo shoot for Switched at Birth. So fun- I'm really looking forward to working with everyone involved.
Whew, just got numbed at the dentist... Such a weird feeling.... Or unfeeling. :)
Finding the right mic for you is tough... I tried out 9 different ones today and didn't find the right one... It was fun though.
About to hop in the studio with @ericbaines...

I parked right under the water tower at Warner Bros. today. I recorded grunting sounds and breathing efforts... I have a weird job. :)
Listening to @drewseeley on The Resolution. Perfect for a rainy 101 ride.
Ken got back together with Barbie... Finally! Now my Valentine's Day is worth celebrating!  What is the world coming to?
What a beautiful day... Again. Let the good times roll.
Just planted a bunch of stuff in my garden. Pretty soon I won't need to go to the grocery store. I love California. It's 80 degrees today.
Thanks @marcblackwell!
Thanks to all who watched the episode last night! Smallville was so much fun. Those bullets really glowed green! I felt like such a badass.
Friends in LA - check out the Nomad Two Worlds art exhibition coming to LA on 2/23.  Very inspiring work! http://fb.me/FBYGaSEw
I will be on SMALLVILLE tonight. CW -8/7Central. Please check it out!
For some reason, customs agents always give me shit; for no reason -it seems. Must be the worst job. They're always angry.
I just recorded 461 vocal tracks over a span of 6 hours. I've never spent so long tracking a vocal. So much fun, but can't think straight.
On my way to the airport... Again. I haven't slept in almost 26 hours. Whew, what a day.
Good morning world, off to the airport! I don't really mean that exclamation... It's way too early for an exclamation point.
Good morning world, off to the airport! I don't really mean that exclamation... It's way too early for an exclamation point.
Sorry I've been absent lately. Working hard and not using my phone too much. As you may see, I kinda go in phases with Twitter/Facebook.

Hey everyone- watch my buddy Drew Seeley in Glory Daze tonight at 10!
I know I'm way behind, but Charlie Chaplin in my new hero. I can't believe my parents didn't make me watch him when I was little.
Just ate at Monster Thai on Riverside. There are only 5 tables in the whole place. Delicious, but improperly named.
With Apple's new App store you can yet again pay for angry birds. Don't think I can do it. HeyTell is my new favorite iPhone app & its free

I'm so close to 100,000... And we are so close to 2010! Thanks everyone! Happy New Year!
The celebration starts tonight... Let's bring this new decade in the right way.
I think the world is starting its final chapter. I just saw a member of N'SYNC with gray hair.... Now that makes ME feel old. Won't say who.
The jetblu peeps are full of the Xmas spirit. They are opening gifts from each other before we take off. It's cute.
Good times in Missouri. I left just as the weather was getting worse. Lucky me. Haven't seen ice covered trees in a long time. That was cool
Three flights today. Can't wait to get home.
Just ate at @gardentroom with @autumngrabeel and Henry in Rogersville - Mmm tasty.
There was a line all the way around the DMV building at the moment it opened. They must be showing Star Wars or something inside.
Almost 6am and still up. I guess we did well.
Yes.
Vegas. I can't say anymore.
Just saw Black Swan. "it was perfect"
I did my one day of shopping for the year... And I got one gift. I hate shopping.
Whoa, I just saw that I had 96,000 followers! So amazing. Thank you everyone. Do you think I can get up to 100,000 by the end of the year?
I'm about to go rehearse with @ericbaines for his show on Friday -so excited. I love playing out live. 9:30 at On the Rox if you're in LA.

Ciao, 'Couve!
I think all of the employees of the Vancouver airport woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. I hope the pilot got some sleep. :)
After roaming the streets of Vancouver for an hour or so, I decided to grab a bite at this great French place. Yum.
Almost done with work - quite a heavy scene. I'm feeling a little drained. I think I'll go to the movies after we're done. What should I see

‚Äú@ashleytisdale: About meet up for dinner with my brother @mrgrabeel. Haven't seen him in awhile, so excited :) yay‚Äù - excited myself!
It's a cold day here in the 'Couve - but festive. There's some big Christmas parade going on. I think I'll just watch from afar.
Just watched Fair Game. Great movie - made me think about how much we Americans truly take advantage of "democracy".
I just wrapped, on my way to check in at the hotel. I haven't worked a 16 hour day in a long time. It was awesome! Smallville Rocks!
