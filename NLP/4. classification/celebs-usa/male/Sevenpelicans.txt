@inrng ironically "in said race" it is a UCI rule not to ride bike path in race. Also would incur fine or penalty.
@inrng supposedly riders are supposed to use bike path a long side of road here in West Flanders. Even at 50kph on a TMR Time Machine

Off to Shanghai, China via Tokyo. On ANA airways. I'm guessing my femur length is above the national average in Japan.
Sometimes I think of myself as the "Ricky Bobby" of expense reports.
Really Euro? Climb the entire time were in Europe and drop a day after I get home?
Zane insisted we measure him for a suit this morning. He's going to need a 9L.
Someone was excited when he woke up.  http://lockerz.com/s/98657182
Note to self: Pay after you pump gas in Germany. Or drive someone else's car and hop on an airplane home before ahawkes finds out. #whoops
As the years go on I find myself wondering if eventually the sport called "cycling" will some day just be called "doping".
@arae_miller yeah, that seems a little steep. I mean it  is not like you pump it out of the ground and refine it. It grows on a tree.
A small Starbucks coffee in the Brussels terminal is USD 7.50. #nuts

Is a small messenger bag really considered a man purse? Cuz, if that's the case I've been breaking one of my own rules since Fl√®che.
Raining in Izegem when I got back guess I dropped my sunshine off with @TaylerWiles, @i_am_kmac, and @ATetrickStarnes.
Scored a free ‚Ç¨ out of my all so familiar Texaco cappuccino machine. Gonna be a good day. Already logged 2.5 of my 8 hours of driving today.

I went from 4 normal pens to using a blue pen with a ball on top that flashes light when you move it in only a few weeks. What is happening?
There is something about bags while traveling. They just keep getting bigger and bigger.

Staff hard at work loading the cars for another stage. Stg. 3 of the Energiewacht Tour. Twisty and windy to say the least. #USACWomen
Pretty sure I just got my first euro speeding ticket. Unless the picture was blurry.
@usacycling riders presentation. Going to be another good day in Holland. #usacwomen http://plixi.com/p/90497311
Guess little Zaner is gonna continue to learn to talk with out me. I hear the other night his new sentence was "Dadda bye".
Good riding by the @usacycling ladies today at the Energiewacht Tour. Impressive. Glad to have the in car mentoring by @bensharp13 as well.
Made it to Holland and the sun looks to be coming out.
Again, another amazingly exciting race. And once again with radios. BMC road great.
Arrived in Izegem. By far one of the warmest days I've ever experienced in Belgium.
The last few panhandlers Ive come across don't seem to look any different then me. Not sure what to think of that.
How do you plead not guilty after hitting someone with your car? After stopping and then fleeing the scene? http://bit.ly/dIgMSL
Sad news in the paper today. Hope Terry gets well soon. http://plixi.com/p/87462603
Haven't crashed in long time. Started to take for granted my BMC FS02's "point and shoot" capabilities. Glad it was muddy.
Sorry to hear @brentbookwalter broke his collarbone today in Catalunya. Good thing @BMCProTeam has some good people to fix that for him.
Nice to see @scvelocycling posting San Dimas results so quickly.
Big thanks to @slateolson for the delivery of @rapha_n_america gear I received today. Thanks!
Two good signs Zane spent the day at Grandpa's house: grease covered hands and/or his diaper is on backwards. And a huge smile on his face.
Heading home from dinner and caught a glimpse of  @MeganGuarnier coming in late. Must of been dodging clouds today.
That was some exciting racing. From what I can tell this year, radios = more exciting races. Congrats to @BMCProTeam a great race.
My little guy is digging the feeds from Tirreno.  http://plixi.com/p/84192388
@danschmatz sheesh! How are you gonna top his B-day present next year?
Contrats to @BMCProTeam at Tirreno today. Impressive and crafty.
Nice! RT @bensharp13: Hey @Sevenpelicans, your car arrived. http://plixi.com/p/83714393
Man, I guess Charlie Sheen all over the news is actually a good thing. I remember the 89 quake here, devastating. Sad news in the Pacific.
@podiuminsight yeah, I saw you working. Thanks for all the great coverage.
@thachad not until the town recovers from the cappuccino drought that occurred soon after your arrival.
Just finished up my first expense report ever.....not sure if that is a sign of moving up in the world?..... Or down?
@kryansocal You too. Way to animate this weekend.
Congrats @AStarnes!
Did u get a "periwinkle blue caravan"? RT @bensharp13: As I told @jimMILLERTIME, as of this afternoon, I'm officially a homeless gipsy.
MTB'd with 1 of those exec type fellas from Mancini's Sleepworld today. Tried to put him in locker and negotiate deal, no success, I'm slow
@atouchstone no, I'm more concerned about the beef in china.
Wonder what the airlines will charge for a freezer full of untainted meat? Probably cheaper than a bike.
Zane was mad I didn't bring him anything from Qatar. So he stole my slippers  http://plixi.com/p/78628046
@brentbookwalter happy b-day man.
If you could get pwr/hr off of a domesticated adolescent rabbit that would explain my power file today. Discouraging but 10% up on yesterday
@danschmatz damn! I'll send you another proposal tomorrow.
@kryansocal where's camp at?
Tight connection in IAD. Barely made it, pretty sure @CorynTheG made her's as well. Almost home.
@Mickeyhavoc thanks man.
@AStarnes if I'm lucky, haven't come across any on tv yet. There's 9 soccer games on though.
Spent some time in the @BMCProTeam car today here at stage 1 of Qatar. Learning from the best. Crazy course today.
I finally bite the bullet on a sick flat screen and then I go and miss the superbowl.
Had a good chat with my old @BMCProTeam staff last night. Miss those guys.
Two more days in Qatar here with @CorynTheG. 2 hour check ups are going well.
@TrudiLR @Sevenpelicans yeah definitely.
Good luck from Eddy at the start of Stg. 3.  http://plixi.com/p/74676998
@clivermore 3k out in the crosswind section before a 1k tailwind finish. Good timing.
Not the best of luck today for us. 2 crashes and a little caught of guard. But, a great salvage of the day by @AStarnes with a top ten.
This is the Qatar I remember. Take a look at the tree's. Should be a fun day. http://plixi.com/p/74429834

Remembering the days where we would drive around looking for monster puddles.
@jamesselman yeah man came down with a mystery illness been bad for months. Feeling a little better have a new director job coming up.

Back home in Girona from another 6 weeks out of a bag. Went to pick up a crib for Zane on our way home from BCN but couldn't fit it.
@Kristoff87 went down hard today in a stupid gravel road construction section. Sounds like he didn't break anything. What a sketchy day.
I get pissed if I spill coffee. What happen to the value in oil?
The word "gourmet" as a descriptor for coffee is way over used and should be translated as watered down burnt coffee flavored water.
Good Luck to the @BMCProTeam today in the Tour de Suisse.
@kelouder Yeah found it. My mistake was that I didn't click over to the French site. Thanks. Now how to prepare in 3 days.
Happy Birthday to my good friend Zach Walker. He is officially old today.
Wonder how many days and what the stages will be like at Tour De Beauce? Can't find any info online.
Spent the morning with @clivermore at @EndurancePTC today and did some testing and talked over some training. Productive.
Parkour!

Good day for BMC here at USPRO. Road well. @louderjeff really deserves the jersey. Soloed the last 4k and got caught with 500 togo.
@chrisbarton88 yeah man is it president butter? Heard your doing l' avenir, nice.
If Mike Sayers was a bounty hunter he'd be the DOG.
Can't believe guys get so desperate for a cigarette that they sneak smoke them in the airport bathroom. Guess I take fresh air for granted.
Thomas Frei in Lauerposition. Looks like the Swiss BMC guys are rocking it at the GP-Tell in Switzerland this week.
Massaged. Regenerated. Ready to log some more frequent flyer miles tomorrow. USPRO should be good.
@The_Hollywood Sick! Wish ADAMS had a iPhone app.
@brentbookwalter dude you and @herriottsp better not be listen in on my calls! C3 is on a hiatus until I can drop some moral standards.
Just got off the phone with my coach @clivermore at Endurance PTC. Put together a good plan for the next weeks.
RT @VinceGee: Jersery for Best Utah rider goes to.....What? HUH? Am I dreaming? Typo? He isn't even AMERICAN!! Are you kidding?
Gave my fastest rear wheel change ever to Stalder today with running push. Then to chase pretty hard just to catch before a truce call.
Graeme is the man. We're almost there 6th on the day and overall for Frankie. Traffic = mobile bandwidth usage and a headache.
Wondering what Graeme's record max speed in the transporter is and pondering if the world plowing champs held here in Ireland will be on tv?
@brentbookwalter The Blarney stone took a piss on me...other than that it's been good. Take that shiza back tonight.
I wonder how many acres of Ireland are used to produce the world's Guinness? http://tinyurl.com/lgd5p3
@theTourofUtah LOUDER!
Rain. Now well see what real Irish racing is like.
RT @podiuminsight: Chasers caught, bmc at front of field led by Garcia #tou break @ 1k to feed - Yeah Garcia!
I hope the BMC TOU guys had steak sandwiches for lunch. I should of had one for breakfast.
Bunch of drunk Prom kids at our hotel tonight. Drinking age is 18. Just saw one drive a car into some older guys car in the parking lot.
Anyone know a consistant realiable Twitter feed for tour of utah? Wondering how it's going for BMC.
Hope the guys smash that monster they call Nemo today in TOU. They smashed me there last week. 4500 feet. Can you say time cut?
Eavesdropping on the mechanics, it's amazing what is involved in running this team. Their work goes unnoticed, atleast by most.
Ordered 2 smoothies for lunch and got 2 smithwick's.
New blog post: Ireland http://www.jacksonstewart.missingsaddle.com/2009/08/19/ireland/
Stoked for the BMC guys at TOU.
@brentbookwalter yeah Brent! Nice man!
Fighting the lag. Instant coffee and internet should keep me up till dinner. Cruz is out, couldn't make it past 5.
Landed in Dublin this morning with Cruz. Green wet bikepathroads. Best of luck to the TOU guys in tonights prologue. @thachad no burnouts.
Wondering what channel @louderjeff will be on tonight here in Alta?

@bewert Louder will still pull it off without me. Now he'll just have to yell less.
RT @VinceGee: Today's birthday boy is Chad Beyer. Happy birthday Chad!
Excited for Tour of Ireland. Looks like a cool race. It would be cool to help defend @louderjeff 's TOU title but, Ireland it is.
Done spinning now it's time for a burrito and @Garciasoup to practice the robot. http://twitvid.com/7899D

@Garciasoup practicing so jerkin with @thachad and @brentbookwalter during our rest day here in Alta.  http://twitvid.com/D5A6F
Just met with Dr. Major. Garcia got his stiches pulled from his smackdown at Elk Grove. http://twitpic.com/dn0m0
Just found out that I'll be filling Zberg's Tour of Ireland spot. No Tour of Utah for me. Still going to finish up the Alta camp though.
What goes up must come down.  http://twitpic.com/dmkl3
Best wishes to Zberg just heard he has broken his hip.
Just finished up dinner and a confrence call with bossman Havoc. http://twitpic.com/dksh8
Think I just figured out the formula: Tired = 5+ hours + absurd vertical feet of climbing + a day long half-wheeling contest + altitude.

@atouchstone or I flipped my phone upside down.

Bad morning for @brentbookwalter recent news reports say Lady Gaga is a hermaphrodite.

SJC-SLC. Nice breakfast with the fam before departure. Racing w/ @thachad "the whip" again.
@bewert Yeah. Thats what I hear. We'll see how it goes.
Heading off to fish out of water camp tomorrow. Taking deep breaths right now. Alta, Utah is suppose to be nice. I call top bunk!
@TrudiLR No. I think he's headed to Garcia's for a milk chugging contest. How you been?
At the grocery store and the guy in front of me is buying a shopping cart full of gallons of milk. Estimating 40 gallons. Got milk?
@Garciasoup yeah man. I used to watch that show all the time on the road. I love the paint ball guns.
@thachad I take it your back.
@brentbookwalter just got done myself. Man they take more n more tubes everytime. Sporting the standard puffy cotton and white tape.
RT @Chrissoigneur: And after a crazy day we won the last stage in Tour of Namur with Daniel Holloway. Yeah Holloway!
Dinner at the kabob house tonight with the Hibbards. Good friends that will be moving to Chicago. Last of the clan to move away.
@louderjeff that's gonna cost them! I hope judge Joe brown does logo infringment cases.
Think I'll go with these two. http://twitpic.com/ctf3i

Local news:  mini goats are tasty treats for large stray german shepards in castro valley, CA.
On a plane again. This time I got a decent neighboring passenger. Liking the Phoenix- Wolfgang Amadeus album.
What's with erratic volume changes on tv. One minute it's blaring the next you can barely hear it? You'd think we could fix this.
Good racing by BMC today. Ended up getting the team prize, 2nd overall with @brentbookwalter and I think 3 more in the top 10.
@Garciasoup is alright got some stiches and got a sweet barcode road Id bracelet.  http://twitpic.com/cgy7p
@podiuminsight looks like he might be okay orthopedic wasn't available until tomorrow. We'll learn more in the morning.
Tony Cruz rolled 4th.
@louderjeff had a go off the front and @Garciasoup did as well until he crashed hard. Waiting to hear the status, rumour is broken elbow.
Elk grove day 2 finished. don't really know if I've ever seen a race like that before. Maybe the biggest and longest criterium ever.
@brentbookwalter I pretty sure there are going to be wizards as well.
Zirbel just smoked it. Bummer for @brentbookwalter he was flying today, just forgot to throw his bike. Good ride all round for BMC.
Was holdin fastest time until @brentbookwalter smoked it. Now following @louderjeff to see how it is done right.
Watching dumb and dumber in space boots.
I'm calling @McFlash8 for the elk grove tt tomorrow. I know it's ambitious being a pre travel pick and all but, I believe.
The today show is so yesterday.
@thachad fire out some pics man.
@ScottNydam hey I recognize that luxury interior. Nice!
Wife and the little guy are sick. Sitting in the hospital room waiting for them to get better.
RT @dzabriskie: Finally...  http://bit.ly/U549Y
Why do I have to give up my seat to the guy next to me just because he doesn't fit? This happens quite often.
If upcoming races are going to be anything like Cascade, then I think I need to incorporate banging my head against a wall into my training.
Good luck to the BMC guys at Tour of Wallonie. Sounds like the first stage went well.
Chillaxin before the crit. There must be a bandwidth sucking convention being held at our hotel. My wifi is creapin.
Smiling right now, as I drink Jonathon Garcia brewed coffee.
Lead by example. http://twitpic.com/bkp91
Spent the day in the break. Remind me not to get on mike creeds bad side. He'll make you pay. Good riding by the team but no time gains.

Had to teach the Swiss @Bov84 smooth Boove a lesson at dinner today. The more time he spends with @jefflouder the more fiesty he gets.

@thachad Bummer man. Throttle back and start banking all that PMA.
@louderjeff Yeah man. I saw that too?
Trying out the Normatec space boots. Hope I'm doing it right.
Fitchburgs finished. Today went as planned but, didnt quit get the time we wanted to move Ian up in GC. Not a good weekend.
Not really a great day for us here at Fitchburg. Road agressive and got nothing for it. Lame Sauce!
Fitchburg TT went okay. I think everyone wanted to go better though. Today is supposed to be really wet. Good times.
@brentbookwalter Man, who wants more followers? I liked it better when it was just the guys. Sounds like Zirbel crushed it today.
@Longsjo_News Hi, you know where I can find the Pro Men's Fitchburg TT results? Thanks.
@brentbookwalter at his point I just want to get to Fitchburg. Been on this direct flight all day. PMA PMA!
BOS closed stuck on this damn plane for hours landed in Maine waiting on the tarmac to head to an open BOS. 1.5 hour drive after we land
Watch out or Kenny Powers might call you. Powers out!
Knee is feeling better after a couple days off of it. Tweaked it last week. Happy to see it heel up.
Nice to see new sponsors come to cycling. HTC makes great phones. I've been using their stuff for years.
Witnessed a grand FRED-OFF today. Blue Jersey roadie against Skins MTB. It was a solid 10-15min battle but the roadie won. Dropping the MTB
Wondering who won the swiss road championships? And hoping it was BMC.
Stoked to hear the BMC U23 guys will be racing Fitchburg.
Chillaxin in Carmel. Mini Vacay with the family. Our little guy has been kicking alot lately....probably some serious squat sessions goin on
@McFlash8 I think were in cuz I just got my ticket today.
Just cheated death. Never seen a minivan blow out of a drivway in reverse that fast in my life. And then act like nothing happened.
UCI wake up call today. I had a feeling they were coming.
Note to self: Don't tell coach livermore at Endurance your not climbing well this ='s relentless time riding inclines.
What's with mid-day news channels? You click through and all you get is 1 or more dudes shouting as loud as they can.....
Use Engine Degreaser to get the sticky number residue off my jersey from Picardie. Worked. But, now how to get the degreaser off?
Another recovery day on the menu. Might work on the red dragon, maybe go by home depot.....I don't know...I might not have enough time...
Just finished my Dentist app. with good friend and avid cyclist Dr. Jon A. Ornstil. Need a Dentis in San Fran - www.sfdentistonline.com
Think I liked the old cyclingnews.com format better. Especially when I'm browsing on my phone.
Wondering why the UCI lets Lance, Horner, and Levi race Nevada City and we can't. Not that I want to go and get smashed now anyways.
Just came across the all new redbull energy shots. Im pretty sure I will be seeing empty ones all over the BMC truck in the up coming weeks.
Beauce is finished. Scotty Zwiza held the jersey. Excellent ride for him. We went third on the stage and kept the points jersey. Okay Tour
Day went alright but, not great today. Cruz and Bovay again made the break. Wyss picked up 2 points. GC guys didn't lose much time.
Congrats to Scott Zwisanski for smoking the Beacue TT and taking the Jersey. Scott's a good guy and old teammate. Nice to see him ride well.
@brentbookwalter Livin the dream man.
New blog post: venire fuori! http://bit.ly/pAnFo
Okay today. Put guys in the moves all day. The eventual move to stick had Bovay, Cruz, and Kohler. Columbians don't feel gravity.
Listening to Last.fm. Wondering what Nydam is doing. Hoping the BMC team at Dauphine have a great day. Here at Beauce we're planning on one.
Held the Jersey's today. BMC rolled the front and let a non dangerous break of 3 loose. Guys road great. Danillo 5th on the stage.
Good day for BMC at Tour de Beauce. Wyss 1st Beyer 7th. Wyss takes Points and Leaders Jersey. Beyer takes KOM and Young Rider Jersey.

Good riding by BMC at Dauphine Prologue. Awesome. We road Philly well today but, a crash with 500 meter's to go put the kabosh on our sprint
Good luck to the BMC squad at the Dauphine tomorrow. Kind of a big deal.

How long are we going to be at "Security Threat Level Orange"? Its kind of a downer on the whole airport experience.
Not that I have any ties to Cofidis but, its good to see that the team is staying alive.

Up early for a UCI quarterly blood test, my favorite.
@brentbookwalter Hope you got mcmojos wheels, tear it up man.
@AustinCarroll DHolla is the man!!!
Glad to hear Philly's is on. Wish Lancaster made it back but, I'd take Allentown and Reading if that was possible.
@Garciasoup P.M.A.
Guys rocked it at Gila. I hear reports of 3 in the top ten. Considering we only have 3 in the race, i would say thats sufficient.
Retweet: @kwc @Benjm1 ooo, kit diss, careful not to motivate BMC to fight
Just got an earlier flight out of tuscon. Hope Frey and Kohler can keep fighting all week before they get to go home.
@SCottNYdam Shake and Bake!
@hippster Nah, theres other teams in our hotel too.
Watching everyone go to the bike race without me is wierd.
One of the unchosen 5. What a waste of time, things could be worse I guess but, maybe they are we'll see soon. What does the UCI do again?
Meeting. No Gila. Not Syched. Going Home.
Note to Euro teammates: please don't close the toilet lid in the middle of the night.

@Roy_Skinner Congrats on the new place man. movin on up!

How do you get away with this: http://tinyurl.com/dbp4au
Packing. 4 am departure tomorrow. Its been an awesome two weeks minus this stupid sickness thing. Look forward to getting in some rest.
Nydam rocked it today. 112 miles solo win by 2 min. The rest of the team road awesome and stacked it. Wins seem to be contagious.
The whip takes day one at Battenkill. Chad, Garcia, and I in the break all day. Nydam cleaned up the from the field PMA all up in here.
@louderjeff watch out for the sweat bullets while motoing. if they get big enough there hurt like hail.

Oh Simba, why do you like to hurt yourself? You might want to talk to someone about that I hope I don't have to go get Barton too. F'n Nydam
Jeff Louder is a "BOSS-PLAYER". BMC was there when he was crowned "BOSS-PLAYER"!!!
