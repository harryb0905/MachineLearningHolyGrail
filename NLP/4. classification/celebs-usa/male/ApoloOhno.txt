That it is seemingly impossible.  Within that prep, sometimes comes the greatest lessons and joy.  Create your own luck. Prepare and when that opportunity presents itself - maybe...just maybe... luck is on your side :-)   Crush the week! https://t.co/jOm05OQ8Xm
While I look back on that race and still wish that I had won - I am grateful for the opportunity that existed in that realm of life lessons.  Never count yourself out. Take pride in the preparation, the steps of that journey that sometimes are so difficult...
Or was he in the right place at the right time....Did his preparation and "dues" paid to the sport over 20 years meet the opportunity of a lifetime.....a black swan event that hasn't been replicated since 2002.
I was in that race...In 1st place with 15 ft. left to the finish line.  I too went crashing into the pads.  Steven glided by us as well tumbled and crossed the line as the 1st Australian Winter Olympic Gold Medalist in history.  Luck?
This did not deter him.  Watching the 1000m Final in 2002 Salt Lake City is a great reminder that anything can happen.  He was in the final.  He was far behind in the race when the absolute unexpected happened...4 people in front of him fell down...
He paid his dues, had work ethic and a training regime that rivaled the Gods of speedskating.  Been through devastating and inches away from career/life threatening injuries.  The 2002 Olympics - he was not a medal favorite.  He was not even a contender...
Without preparation however, it gives us the greatest likelihood of being in the "right place at the right time".  Take in note my good friend Steven Bradbury.  An Australian Olympic short track athlete who everyone counted out from the start of these races..
"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity" - Seneca the younger.  Olympic pursuit requires years and years of preparation...with "luck" involved.  In Short Track - a sport so volatile and unpredictable, our "luck" was always readily served.
Take the long drive to meet a friend. Set aside the time to talk about goals, dreams, gratitude, compassion and more. Connect. Inspire each other. Ask how you can be of service. Life is… https://t.co/Ott3oRRnlO

Note:  Pu-erh tea doesn't need to be one of the ultra rare/old and expensive ones....like wine - sometimes a great tea is just one that suits your taste!  I personally cannot taste the difference between a 150 year old tea and one that is a few years old.

None of us are perfect.  This is ok!  Life is an ongoing roller coaster of highs and lows.  Cyclical in nature, being present gives us the best chances of success.  Let's crush this week!
Listen to oneself, identify the words that we use, and ultimately you'll see that it affects body language, energy, and mood.  If these are all in a negative state or depressive state, it's difficult to make great decisions.
Diffuse, and vocalize what it is that we want to accomplish.  The mind is the most powerful and underutilized component in our arsenal.  Both in athletic pursuit and life in general - how we quiet the storm inside of our heads directly impacts our actions during the day.
Personally I've faced this challenge on the daily - waking up to a barrage of issues, challenges, and stress.  Howe we approach and tackle each one of these challenges gives us an opportunity to create momentum achieve said goals. Clear the barriers.  Diffuse....
Criticism without constructive problem solving falls on deaf ears.  Remember, even if you are thinking it - the body and mind are always listening quietly.  Even when you think it's not :-)  Keep thoughts and perspective realistic, positive and execute that plan.
While we cannot always control the outcomes of every scenario (IE: Short Track Olympic racing), we can change how we view and perceive these challenges.  Find solutions, get creative, be productive, sit and think, and identify what the true outcome goals are.  Develop and plan.
"The decisions we make control us much MORE than the conditions we meet"  Life is unexpected, unpredictable, and sometimes feels unfair.  Every thought and perception that enters into our mind has a direct impact on how we feel, what we say, and ultimately the decision we make.
