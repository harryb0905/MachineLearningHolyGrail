@egalt @scottlax randomly follow? Ha!
@scottlax My most important rule is one that sums up the 10," he wrote. "If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." E Leonard
@scottlax Don't go into great detail describing places and things.   Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.
@scottlax  Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.   Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.
@scottlaxYou are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.   Never use the words "suddenly" or "all hell broke loose."
Never use an adverb to modify the verb "said”…he admonished gravely.   Keep your exclamation points under control.
@scottlax Never open a book with weather.  Avoid prologues.   Never use a verb other than "said" to carry dialogue.
