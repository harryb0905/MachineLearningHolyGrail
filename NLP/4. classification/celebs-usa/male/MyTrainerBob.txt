. @kateguillot treadmill is more versatile.
. @Melissa0ates That made me laugh out loud.  xoxox
. @graham10g Vitamin B, C, D, fish oil
.@carltheturtle @dailyburn @FitFluential Try doing your weight training before so you are fresh to push WEIGHTS!!
.@RobertOhMD Crossfit Open workout last year. 14.5
. @BodyByEmmy @FitFluential Never a dull moment. Ahaha
. @tukicarreno It was very hard for me to switch to black coffee. I hated it but now I like it!
. @rachbird @dailyburn @FitFluential Pretty much any dessert with refined sugar. Anything fried. That's pretty much it.
