@RACERmag @SROAmerica is his birthday on leap year
@lexi5983 i’ll need to go get one
@NLB_Rays @FlatgroundApp to throw harder he will have to increase his acceleration phase, slow down the beginning to speed up the finish.  hitting redline a little early.   athletic but hips and shoulders need to sync up like a pitcher to throw really hard.
spf 30 https://t.co/HrvTBkIsUJ
@norcalbbgm @FlatgroundApp might want to consider a slightly larger glove ...super small gloves with someone your size and you might be tipping pitches
@EricCressey i witnessed it every year
@adair_nick @FlatgroundApp great extension at release- make sure you are able to do that inside to RHH for max effect / sneaky fast
@EricCressey hard to work with that chart and not say it:  guys can’t register as hurt when they are already hurt right??
oh I like this idea https://t.co/D2NesrRrxH

@marshallpruett #DetroitGPTweets
anyone need a power reliever to try out in spring training? https://t.co/DNtBi5lYCv
@skeeterT36 @BIGmerritt4u @FlatgroundApp @PitchingNinja @cfpats need to see video
@npatterson_12 @FlatgroundApp keep your SL on the glove side of the strike zone and you will get guys taking panic swings against arm side FB’s...and can eventually learn to work the comebacker type FB on gloveside.   really hard to square up for righties not named trout
@npatterson_12 @FlatgroundApp if you can focus on using your changeup straight down (2nd changeup thrown) top of home plate, you will get more chases than if you see it hugely tail off arm side.   throwing this hard will see lots of guys speeding themselves up and your tunnels will be harder to separate
@SauceBaseball @FlatgroundApp if he covers his face up with his arm he won’t be able to pick up target... https://t.co/UYylxAq3rj
@BIGmerritt4u @FlatgroundApp @PitchingNinja @cfpats if you can find a way to really use your quickness - short arm path, quick stride, fast hips- to get hitters cheating...you will tear them up with good offspeed
@MikeHaller thank you Mike.  it’s easy to be an armchair critic, hard to help.  this is a great platform
@cratdaddy yeah and I am decidedly not into it at all
@LoganGJones44 @FlatgroundApp right now with your build you are wiry but if you add weight and can keep your movement patterns quick like this you will be able@tk accelerate the ball better, but make sure the back of your arm and body are able to withstand that extra punishment so you can stay healthy!
@LoganGJones44 @FlatgroundApp ok make sure that you stay really consistent with that front side since it’s pretty compact.  also- with your follow through, really work on the deceleration muscles like posterior deltoids, lats, etc.  as you get more hip and leg strength your velo will jump.
Because it looks like a long nose miata and that is not a compliment. https://t.co/3pCQnpGUjW
@LoganGJones44 @FlatgroundApp caps and sleeves and have hi-res cameras in this league son...🤣  / good flow through the delivery, got any other angles to see arm/hand/release point etc?
@AthletesOptimum @FlatgroundApp if you instead try to ‘throw your slider for strikes’, it will become more hittable- if you throw 90mph then younger hitters won’t be able to really square up FB’s with tail.  the slider strike rolls right into their bats.
@AthletesOptimum @FlatgroundApp your slider really needs to be thrown with the glove side fastball tunnel in mind.    with your arm side run, you can throw the comeback FB to glove side for called strikes and then get huge chases out of the SL
@Wes_Albert20 @FlatgroundApp @DrivelineBB @uspbl looks like a really athletic delivery- fluid, good build up, good whip through...
@mfitzpatrick007 @FlatgroundApp your acceleration looks too tied to your trunk motion.   you have to separate your shoulders and your hips and translate that rotational inertia into extension/whip or your hand.   right now your size is working against you and by leaning over you are never reaching peak torque
@rhazen24 @FlatgroundApp if you start your body going too fast, you redline.  no more room to accelerate.  try to focus on a constant build / ramping up which leads to a little more whip at release.
@OC_JJohnson who cares about mechanics when you have big league hair @FlatgroundApp
@_RunPMC astros stadium
A few years ago when I was a pitcher before my elbow banksy’d itself - I figured hey today’s the day I throw that knuckleball in a game. https://t.co/HJQCmbaX1X
@Smerfing really try to watch the guys with your similar body dimensions and see how they manage the same mass and their attempts at max extension.  not copying, just seeing why it works for them.
@Smerfing more body control, you have to have a little better balance so the release point does not go off the rails.   all righties need to be quick to the plate but don’t force that to the point you lose the whip effect.  if your hips or shoulders are too sped up your hand will stall
@Smerfing with your frame, velo and effectiveness as a pitcher will come from harnessing the balance and flow to time all the moving parts and put the ball where you want.  physically you are strong and amped up.   might be 2-3mph more from building up that energy thru the whole delivery
@rhazen24 @FlatgroundApp a little more leg drive a little earlier, if your core can keep you in line and you will generate more length/ extension
@coachr0ry @FlatgroundApp @boyett_clayton @BLBoyett more single leg and hip strength will help maximize your natural flexibility / range of motion and allow to keep accelerating instead of squishing into your front leg, you ca extend your release point further and keep whipping
@crebright @FlatgroundApp try and accelerate the ball after the body...good downhill plane potential with that slot but need to make sure there are no hitches that stall momentum of the hand
@Cj_Schildt20 @FlatgroundApp @CSP_Pitching nice, well that is plenty - especially if you can cut the ball.  what feels better??
@PitchingTutor @FlatgroundApp @PitchingNinja really fluid for a young big guy with that velo- keep that core strong and will help posture / consistency/ repeatability to avoid getting too deep in legs.  is the pre bent back leg to be quick to plate?  using whole body.  looks like an athlete!
@Bullardman @FlatgroundApp if your hips work more vertically/ at an angle, they would all you to whip downwards and create angle...assuming you have a lot of arm side run and have a hard time keeping glove side FB from tailing back over at times?  by using more ball of your left foot, you control body more
@Cj_Schildt20 @FlatgroundApp @CSP_Pitching CB or slider...I threw both.  how hard to you throw?   harder you throw, less essential a CB is...slower, it’s important.  if you throw medium speed you need a slower bigger BB, guys like Greinke Wizard- effective w/ bigger spread and guys like Andrew Miller just go wipeout SL
@Miss_LMiller @zpretzel @FlatgroundApp whatever I can do to help
@chuggins23 @JasonD49 @FeedJake14 @FlatgroundApp damn that’s rad.    for increased velo you need to add extension or ‘increased amount of time to accelerate’
@Cj_Schildt20 @FlatgroundApp you could realistically manage a good sinker to glove side with your angle and that is almost impossible for LHH to hit, works as a great strikeout pitch to RHH.  but it requires using both sides of zone...glove side is most important for your slot.
@Cj_Schildt20 @FlatgroundApp haha that’s rad.  every pitcher has a particular geometry, a tunnel that works for or against their pitch selection and swing types.    generally a lefty that can crush righties under their hands does ok!!  each ‘spot’ has corollary spots that work in complement.   max those
@bigkav4 @FlatgroundApp if you can keep that front shoulder closed a wee bit longer you will add more whip.  but you will need more grip strength to compensate.
@jessie_ball23 @FlatgroundApp from 3b side of mound you need to REALLY control that glove side of plate.  figure out how to get guys to chase on that side, especially righties.   anything you throw to arm side will be effectively slower so develop a bounce/ chase type changeup
@chuggins23 @FlatgroundApp with your quick release, you could consider variable hold times to really screw hitters with big leg kicks.   that slide step type delivery ruins big tall guys that have long swings.  also- kudos for work ethic to throw by yourself outdoors this time of year.
@Cj_Schildt20 @FlatgroundApp from your arm slot if you can really drill glove side 4sm/2sm/CFB you will be very tough on RHH.    hide ball well and compact.   you need a good 3B/Ss combo though!!
@zpretzel @FlatgroundApp if you work on your single leg strength with some balance drills, lunges and dynamic- end range stuff (like those annoying hip bands) you will have a lot better stability and power on your landing leg.  will add velo and allow you to keep ‘driving’ longer down mound
@maximized_BSB @FlatgroundApp @AbelColeson @LonestarBSBclub @PBR_Texas good use of high FB and CB
@MotorTrend @Porsche hey motor trend get the facts correct since numbers do matter- the 16 boxster spyder made 375hp not 350
@CSUFAlumx2 whatever you mail to the Porsche Fresno Dealership with a SASE I’ll return no problem
@juco4life @PitchingTutor I went to Juco, after being ‘too small’ to get a good college offer despite great academics.  stress fractured my back as a freshman. Player of the Year in Soph season.  Full ride Jr year!
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 joe’s SL was a sidearm curveball and o’day’s SL was an overhand slider from submarine angle, spin wise.   O’day’s best pitch was the Jenny Finch aka the Riser.  it was magic
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 I had two phenomenally successful sidearm teammates- O’Day and Joe Smith.  each had completely different spin.
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 but it all starts with a grip you have confidence in!   hand size and finger strength are the main determining factors in how your pitches will deviate from each other.
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 5) once you have torque being applied, NO PAIN, and can get it to glove side of the plate, you have to be able to repeat 15-16/ 20 before you really can add variance.  this will take months for most people
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 4) caveat: throwing sidearm and transferring body rotation into hand speed and then spin direction is different but fundamentally all breaking pitches need a release where you torque your fingers against the forward motion
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 3) after you can get it going in the right vector/ direction / trajectory, you can start adding speed.   then you can make subtle tweaks once you are at 8/10 trajectory and effort
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 2) you have to work in slo mo, like a batter on a tee, go to soft toss etc.  DO NOT just ‘send it bro’ and rip sliders at game speed in the pen.  get something lighter, throw slower
@MikeUp @FlatgroundApp @chasechiasson8 how I teach SL/CFB to n00bs:   1) only throw it to glove side until you at least get it there 10/10 in a row.
@FlatgroundApp @PitchingTutor @jucoroute @DrivelineBB @PitchingNinja child abuse
@insuRestaurants @FlatgroundApp @jacekvillanueva be careful about overstriding.  if you go too deep and cannot ‘fire’ your hips then you are just decelerating your lower half and minimizing the whip effect.   each pitcher has s different body composition and therefore different kinetic timing- but that looks very balanced
@chasechiasson8 @FlatgroundApp in order to get more consistent with your breaking pitches you have to ‘build’ them- firs the grip...are you gripping all of them exactly the same each time?  is your stride/ arm slot, glove side, target etc all the same every time?   you have to eliminate variables, start small
@MikeTippit29 @esmee_hawkey @PorscheRaces they are not real yet!  new A7 just came out...
@MikeTippit29 @esmee_hawkey @PorscheRaces we don’t even have S7’s and you want an RS7?  man...

@jeebles333 @michiokaku yes but if you “sweep a flashlight” then it goes from left to right...every word is important in a word problem.  not every star is equidistant
@AlexVaz714 yes if we were able to filter and ‘reblood’ ourselves we would flush lots of garbage and diseases right away.  5-10% better survival ratio on lots of infections etc.
@michiokaku simultaneousness is not faster than light.  true entanglement only allows for mutual participatory vibration.  trick question.
@michiokaku better stated- what is the half life of a photon?  A flashlight beam is not bright enough or wide enough to cover a galaxy all at once, it’s a small weak specific photon vector device.   each photon reaches diff’t destinations at different times, enabling relativity to remain
unlike a car, I cannot change and swap pieces of the brakes or tires.  my cartilage (suspension) degenerates but i can put new bushings in the suspension.   the engine oil can be swapped.

@raikkonenfan32 it’s theoretical at this point, needs to differ as a negative is not necessarily defined by being opposite.  a push and a shove are similar but a pull is different.  different force vectors are not defined as negative
@EmmaMuhleman1 so, print your own bonds and lever up against them is not the best strategy?  yikes if they really all have this going on that is a doom loop
@AnRam13 I never had enough cartilage to be the pitcher I wanted to be.  I’ve always been into astrophysics.   I’ll tie it into a TED talk one day.
if ‘no energy destroyed just converted theory’- the gravity ‘wave’ would have a ripple effect which would ‘push’ various spinning galaxies apart. but that is a pos effect not negative. gravity waves would theoretically have ripples-if space time is quantum, connected, entangled https://t.co/4dNbu5mC8m
@CMPunk lol.  xo
mathematically?  Magnetism is positive and negative.  Gravity is only positive, and compounds with density into a hyperbolic equation (mathematically going to infinity) since it ceases to take up space past an event horizon.  There is no equivalent ‘negative black hole’ https://t.co/wsmH0yPCb7
@TedisMyNickname damn that’s incredible
@FleetwoodJMac @theaceofspaeder @ScottLindholm so many outstanding players stepped on and off these fields.  for years, i got to play against future hall of famers- it was an honor
@crodpolitics @Angels @McLarenF1 i just need some reliable elbow cartilage
@RLaffy @michiokaku well that’s a hot take
@SkipTurner1 @michiokaku exactly.  on a time scale...we would have to run computer animation simulations to augment our understanding.  the universe is so static to us in this short lifetime that imagining the true vast expansiveness and flexibility of planetary forces is like a bad drinking game
@michiokaku space foam collision multiverse theory would mean that there is no time and we’re in a loop of expanding bubble/colliding bubble...however the question is- where is the edge?  what rules apply to the edge? how do you observe a galactic level effect?
@michiokaku the multiverse/ soap bubble theory would allow us to spin into a nearly infinite loop of multiverse foam galaxies slipping and sliding into each other.  but bubbles pop and release massive energy redirecting new directions.  party foam.

every sport is a quilt woven by the skills of its top players.   each season is their story.  the stats are their facts, their timeline.  Curry’s shot, Trout’s miracle catch.  Bolt’s explosion from the gate.  defining moments in sport history are built with their life’s sweat.
in bill james’s dystopian vision of baseball future, there are no homers, and MLB tonight has no highlights to replay.  front offices coach replacement players over radio signals.  nobody throws 95 mph.  games take either 75 minutes or never end.   take a knee.
@MikeyY626 same guy thinks Cal Ripken is not a true superstar, joe paterno has no idea, and does not realize that players generate the revenue for the teams by being amazing athletes.  imagine a league or replacement player highlights.  oh hey, joe nobody tripped chasing a fly ball.

using barry bonds 1999-2003 to make an argument about strike zones or pitching inside is just as crazy as using Vlad Guerrero in metrics or arguments about pitch sequences, strike zone etc.                               rules and enforcement need to deal w/ the meat/ non mutants

@Mike_M_Morgan 50% of that is bad umpiring, 49% bad pharma
@willh94 I’ve hit guys on purpose for various reasons, never for getting hits off me.  Bad haircut, pimping a homer, etc all better than because you’re scared to give one up

Give me a break.  If you strike out 12 guys are they supposed to charge the mound?    You hit guys because they bowl over your infielder or because their team drilled your equivalent player.   If a hitter is on fire, make him chase. https://t.co/TYCRNBjh0H

@Knep24 MLB has a hard enough time on scheduling for bad weather cities in April that adding 2 game series to Non-Time Zone Interleague could be too aggressive and melt computers
@Knep24 We play more games with less rest.  Than any other sport- only hockey can really compare in terms of the schedule brutality.  NBA:  the court is uniform, they play in AC and less guys on team/ less guys on airplane/ more rest.   Making extra stops is easier for them to handle.
@Knep24 Fair point but without interleague you never would have seen him without traveling...           promotions are based on media, quality of media is based on training, training quality based on goals and expertise...ad infinitum until we go subatomic and discover Troutium27 alloy
@marshallpruett That Denzel is fine
@m_smitty2 There are plenty of willing celeb players.   But you can’t make just anyone into Big Papi.   A lot of us had relatively “fun” attitudes, and how quick they forget guys who don’t go straight to cable tv...
@joseph_frary @Mariners They always have
@costacabrera45 I love baseball but had to really break up after my elbow cartilage went missing.  I’m considering jumping back in at some point.
@jeff_smith7 @CANTSCORERUNS Loved my time there.  Loved a lot of it.
@MarieLorenz I’ve been on social media for 15 years.  It has evolved but when it’s part of your daily routine- it does not shake you as much.
@_PhilGardner But MLB would have to push past their horror and actually repost the players.
@JoshRamirez @ithrow88 Dan- you’d be perfect for a podcast
@_PhilGardner Yeah they need to encourage gifs and funny things.  Lots of players are funny.
@duxpuck When you get asked about your girlfriend etc it gets weird.  When you tell them it’s out of bounds, they start digging through your trash.  It’s a vicious cycle of dumpster diving.
@CoreycatesNTX Not true, all players care about their future, and the future of the game.   MLB has failed to allow foreign faces on the currency so to speak.
@CoreycatesNTX Uh
@CANTSCORERUNS I was talking about my time with texas
Right but we still have to personally filter lots of negative comments routinely.  That’s the toughest aspect - we lose games and since we are online, we get assassinated.   Hard to coach calmness https://t.co/JxgHFVINNJ
Bad reporters are still published (free country) and make their agenda / click bait out of sniping comments and tearing down players. https://t.co/fnFgiw2R6H
When your manager or GM says:  “delete your account” / “stop talking to fans” / “stay out of the media” repeatedly...then how is that going to improve the game as a whole?  Take a knee Rob Manfred.   Your teams are the issue, not the players.  PLAYERS want to tell their stories.
If the teams and players got a little more coaching on how to manage media, social media, etc and were not instantly criticized for losing a game “because they tweeted X” then maybe guys would evolve to allow their personality to shine.
Truthfully, some players do not want to expose themselves to potentially negative reactions and find it safer to avoid interviews, avoid TV etc- mostly because we have all seen teammates get burned by reporters, fans etc for being human and making mistakes.
A vast majority of the players in MLB are blue collar, hard working, and upstanding citizens.   We often times tried to advance ideas of how to improve promotion of the game and are met with silence or increasingly obtuse ideas that only hold back players individually.
MLB needs to take a look in the mirror before pawning issues off on one player with a pretty great track record of doing everything right.  For over a decade they have failed to promote individual players.   Teams are just as guilty of not wanting to promote players.
@VernonWells10 @MLB @MikeTrout #TeamTrout
@Buster_ESPN Mike Trout has always been classy, genial, positive, completely drama-free in his personal life and professionally.  He does not show up opponents, umpires etc.  mike was always one of the guys ready/willing to visit CHOC Childrens Hospital locally- and not just once- always.

@JCDevilsYanks12 @sung_minkim @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark Everyone can find ways to improve.  But most players in general don’t work as hard as the top guys.
This is why Max is a boss https://t.co/IqRcWifsqY
@VulgarBayFan @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark So is he the/your gold standard for how to live or just a great and successful pitcher?
@opiateofblame @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark The Beltre kneel is the best.  Anyone that has a problem with beltre is a buffoon
@TonyParadis1 @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark I never got a paycheck for flirting...
@_PhilGardner @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark Jose gonna Jose.  Great player in a big moment.
@erikjonschuman @FreddieFreeman5 Yes but only because Summer Altice signed it.  She was a big deal at our high school!
@RayPatchen @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark I’d say on balance it was more time on the training room table than babe patrol.
@rmrcdy29 @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark I never played cards and spent more time on video and analyzing opponents...I didn’t have the most innate talent so I felt like nerding out was my only option to succeed.   Babes are everywhere but I didn’t chase cleat chasers.
@rmrcdy29 @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark Vs most pitchers I gave up less homers- I hated giving up homers and worked my ass off to know where not to throw the ball to each hitter.   Also tended to give up homers to guys that were younger (altuve in 2015) vs a big papi type of guy who would pimp the trot.
@peaceful_flower No but we always talk about it
@JCDevilsYanks12 @sung_minkim @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark So, if 75% of the MLB players are “normal” and only 25% therefore are “beyond normal” in terms of mental prep, extra stats and video work, extra cross training etc...not only is that a more successful player as a subset but that player is craftier and vindicates through success
@JCDevilsYanks12 @sung_minkim @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark I can see you don’t spend a lot of time in a locker room.   First of all- everyone gives up homers.  2nd- very few MLB players actually work beyond the normal scope of physical practice.   I’ll put it at 25% really do “extra work”.   3rd- most guys focus on de-stressing (cards)
@westcovinajoe @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark Sure-  but as a pitcher you have the option of doing the same thing.  It’s a choice.  You can throw at a guy or strike him out, or work hard to figure out his weakness, then strike him out, then disco slide off the mound to show him up.  If you feel like it.
@bluegoon82 @JeffPassan @outtadapakmark If you put in the work, the results are good and the amount of homers you give up is less...which means better quality babes.   Maybe.
@JeffPassan @outtadapakmark Guys offended by bat flippers always have the option of practicing better pitches that get vaporized less often, watching video, knowing the scouting report...but would rather play cards or check out babes in the stands.
@peaceful_flower If I hit a guy on purpose it was not because of one thing.   Most guys I hit purposefully were for retaliation for their team hitting my teammate

@DaOriginalCLOS @Walterportaf @J_Mauc @re2pectjeta @MLBNetwork Elvis and Beltre were better to pitch GB’s to than Callaspo (yikes) defensively.  This helped a lot.  Plus, fast grass in anaheim, had to make big adjustments to try and use trout, and the OFs.  From 2nd half 2010 to ASG 2012 I’d like to think was 4 super solid half seasons.

The hard thing about transitioning into pro level competition last year was not getting enough testing/ seat time...this year has been a different approach.   My goal has been to test a ton in karts and each time getting back into a GT car has been more productive as a result.
Productive shifter kart day yesterday.  With the focus on testing this year, I’ve been focusing on the kart with eyes on GT4/GTD next year.

@mike1033go you need to find some sound advice on the subject from Texas Baseball Ranch or Cressey Sports
@mike1033go and if he has a shoulder issue he should stop throwing COMPLETELY until symptoms go away.  Not like he has meaningful games at 11...if you want to make him last he has to be strong.  Strong shoulders come from proper weight work and resistance band work.
@mike1033go what kind of shoulder weights and strength training does he do for his shoulder?   If the answer is none...that’s not the right approach.
@bh8675309 well it was not a curveball.
@kbarrettb 100% they are human and every human harbors some bias.
@mike1033go better to stay just under redline.   No bonus for anything other than results now- throwing “as hard as i could” as a reliever might have caused some more elbow issues for me.
@clylealt @PitchingNinja turrble unis
@kbarrettb if I only threw a sinker maybe no big deal but I had 4-5 pitches that all slid, sank, cut, tailed, or skipped.   Catcher’s worst nightmare.
@kbarrettb statistically most umpires are literally 50/50 on borderline pitches.   So if I throw 10 borderline pitches a night deep in the count i could end up with 5 too many walks or 5 too many strikeouts based on umpire alone!   Sketchy.
@kbarrettb hard to calculate because 150-200 pitches are SUPER obvious per game.   But the 20-30 borderline pitches per game make or break a pitcher’s day.   I had a few years of being “most squeezed” with most umpire misses and therefore walks...but I missed a lot too.
@PitchingNinja arrieta wins because greinke looks like an ice dancer doing interpretive jazz tap on that chase.   Two good hitting pitchers
@trabyss89 @PitchingNinja not everyone has all their cartilage.  Some people have special cartilage.

@PitchingNinja LOL.  I topped out around 97.  But I always felt movement was more important than straight velo
@DodgerDoggo @PitchingNinja @ithrow88 i never threw that hard but I was referring to the Gerrit Cole comment.  Dude throws gas

@galyn_nash in 2015 I was really disappointed to not complete the season.  In 2016 I offered to come back as a reliever and was dismissed...did what I could and worked my ass off.   But once my bicep tendon tore off the bone I needed shoulder surgery.
@magnaccione mike G is the best, that’s why he is the GM.  We were going to trade the car or consign it from what he told me.   All good in the end as you now know you can go direct to Mike G with any issues.
@galyn_nash you’re knocking on my door not the other way around
@galyn_nash you realize they insured my contract right?  You also realize (actually probably not) that I rehabbed for 15 months?
@galyn_nash which part?  When I blew my elbow out or my rotator cuff and bicep tendon tore off during rehab?
@magnaccione what exactly happened?
@TheBelder @PitchingNinja still have it
@PitchingNinja @Tmetz31 @lokationnation hit that guy right in the moobs
@PitchingNinja you have to back guys off or give up homers.  Being a little mean on the mound keeps guys honest.   If you just try to live down and away, you will get served.
@Tmetz31 @PitchingNinja @lokationnation pedro pitched the same as an Expo
@AMR_Official @FIAWEC your downforce is showing
@HBOPR @HBO @MLB @GameOfThrones dammit why didnt we do this 4 years ago!!

Painted on pant power https://t.co/Znkbkg1uqI
@Megatron3410 @CJWilsonRacing thank you- we were encouraged by our efforts and I was personally very satisfied we did the nose change so well.  For next race we will have time to get more spares ready
@StevieTheFixer @CJWilsonRacing @IMSARadio @unitnutritionco @alpinestars @marcmillershow @KunoWittmer @cjwautogrp @sebringraceway @IMSA @continentaltire haha i like that one
Great first Sebring experience for the team- one small pit lane incident cos.... https://t.co/DdHkOpyN8h https://t.co/UwjxlyEXH6
After a quick nose job, we’re back at it.  Lost a few laps due to contact but @marcmillershow gained back a ton of track position.   ~6 hours to go and Kujo Wishgranter gets in after Phil Blockchainer #StPattysDay #Sebring12Hr @imsa @CJWilsonRacing
@HurricaneBarca @CJWilsonRacing @RealTimeAcura do what ya gotta do!
Will Shamrockfarmer has a few more laps and then @KunoWittmer hops in for @CJWilsonRacing just over 9 hrs to go! #Sebring12Hr #IMSA @IMSA #Florida

@PitchingNinja stinky cheese/ frumunda cheese
@TheRaceTool they somehow did not mention benihana double meat pre game lunches
@CJWilsonRacing @KunoWittmer did we just become best friends ?
@Marko_K14293 @CJWilsonRacing @sebringraceway @IMSA @NickiThiim he’d be on the list if i had Aston Martin!
@tokulski it was a funny angle
Apparently he has made racist comments about one of our sales people on yelp.  Anyone forget to medicate their grandpa?
Met a dream customer today- boinked his pos car off of one of our new cars, head on.  “It’s your fault for leaving the car there, its a so called bumper for a reason” - my question was- so you just drive into cars on curbs and gas stations? Yes it’s your fault #BumpAndRun #CarBiz
My first ever Sebring 12 Hour race!! Pick me! https://t.co/NUI6TAzaMS
@PitchingNinja true story the best pitches I ever threw to bautista he swung and hit him in the leg.   I’ll have to find a gif
@PitchingNinja guy is lucky it didn’t hit him in the kids
@automobilemag you have a volvo suv in with a bunch of enthusiast cars that look fun.  Is it supposed to be their chaperone?
@PitchingNinja yikes
@StreetSpence86 @PitchingNinja @TheRealJoeFlo swing thigh high outer half and hope to run into it
@TheRealJoeFlo @PitchingNinja kershaw and garret richards and bumgarner and some of the guys with irregular deliveries would cause seizures for general public
@cbmurdock @PitchingNinja yes well lots of video does one or the other.  His 96 much wonkier than most 96
@PitchingNinja finally a view angle that captures actual pitch speed and vector
@mike_schaub lol
@SpeedFreaks @CJWilsonRacing maybe 30-40 innings left tops.  Hope they come out with some artificial cartilage one day

@UnoCnco well if any of my mazda stores did 300 a month that would be insane.  However, 5000 across a lot of stores is just ok.  We need to grow a lot at my west coast locations
@dwat4273 @JeffPassan none of us is qualified to diagnose or disseminate that information.   Nor is anyone allowed LEGALLY to do so

@MattLeary72 well yes but now I am working as a GM of Porsche Fresno so i’m like every other boss looking at resumes
@jeffarr07 1999 i did stock for mens sportswear, 2000 i worked stock for brass plum and asked to be reassigned because the female sales staff was way too much drama.  Eventually I worked sales for sportswear at mission viejo

@KeigJoseph well don’t be surprised when something else rips loose then.  Sad- he’s got incredible talent.
@KeigJoseph what, did he take bad team doctor advice about pitching through bone spurs and a torn rotator cuff too?

@BenRogers only 3 or 4 sports actually generate any revenue and baseball gets hosed with only 11.7 allowed scholarships and basketball gets 12.  NCAA is a total joke and CFB makes college unaffordable (arms race) for good students that just want to get degrees.   Loans?  LOL.
@BenRogers if colleges didn’t spend so much money (to earn money from Bowls/ CBS etc) then they would not have to charge the regular kids 250k for an education that’s no better than it was for 80k years ago.   50-65k a year for college is crazy, lots of profit in there
@gavindawson college FB is the reason why big schools cost 50k a year now- paying for all those swaggy coaches and 60M stadiums.   Universities and more importantly CBS etc all profit.   The athletes benefit but the non athlete students are HOSED, they get none of that
@IMSA Porsche Cayenne Turbo S begs to differ on “First”
@DRIVE same argument.  Instruction manual...
Fight it out vs the Mountain like @GameOfThrones https://t.co/kPioLq4z7J
@BenRogers I always think- well at least I get a chance to see this guy (super athlete) instead of him doing it against my team.   No player is flawless but WR in QB cold streak is like star closer and sub 500 team.
@BenRogers sometimes fans just need a change of scenery
@DRIVE obviously your salesman didn’t do a proper vehicle demonstration or walkaround

@kevinwithawhy @c i’m at the dealership most of the time
As a racer myself, his joy of being a pilot was very relatable.   #RipDoc  Always king of the hill (4)
He was an inspiration for every pitcher.  We all bore witness to his unrelenting intrinsic motivation.  Sad and numbing news.   (3)
We all wanted to pitch like Roy, but as hard as we would try- nobody could work like Roy.  I was honored to watch, thrilled to face him. (2)
Roy Halladay was unequivocally a hero of our baseball generation- a gifted pitcher that absolutely set every gold standard for MLB.  (1)
@VernonWells10 huge huge bummer.   He was the guy we all aspired to be
@ASOSS111 it’s all relevant and telling.   The leather could be treated differently at the factory.  The thread could be wound tighter, etc
@randywalker21 @1053SS @1053thefan huh?
@MattyK27 well it was a question of alphabetical order
@MattyK27 sorry the correct answer was Robin or Wren
Altuve is a great player and a great representative of baseball for Houston.
@VernonWells10 footballs??!!?
Someone is buying a bar in Houston and it will be called Chuck and George
What’s Verlander doing?  Getting a pen in for Game 8?
@DFWNittanyLion @JimmyTraina he was dominant until 2003-2004?

@DFWNittanyLion @JimmyTraina I was never one to lie or let bullshit fly
@jpabooth15 @DXTraeger @MattGajtka he was 92-95, with Roy Halladay clone mechanics
@LyleMSpencer always check the location
@cammom read Tom Seaver’s book, Pedro’s book, and the interview with Bob Gibson and Reggie Jackson
I LOVE CAFFEINES https://t.co/SlSL0tVD8O
@WazMixPix totally.  But umpires could not see
@ncboomstick23 is he a “tru player” ??  Looks like it
@HurtmanJeff cannot fathom that- no way
@Mike_M_Morgan @DFWNittanyLion @JimmyTraina no not at all.  Just pointing out massive change in mechanics...throws harder now,
@steveselt85 mariano is 6’2” 195.  Perfect fluid athletic body like a wide receiver.   Billy wagner 5’9”.   Kimbrel “6 feet”
@LyleMSpencer i was making an innuendo.  That guy is just a troll.
KJ is the largest elite level closer in history.  Hard to imagine him being signed as a catcher originally
@DFWNittanyLion @JimmyTraina read the mitchell report
Shouldn’t a been standin there https://t.co/dWhCQFDGb9
@JimmyTraina well eventually they started testing
Morton went from a roy halladay fan boy to a kevin brown 98mph side spin sinker.   He just threw some ridiculous pitches to Taylor
McCann trying to bump his fitbit step count #WorldSeries
@CousinJackSalO his tummy is perfect for the shock absorbs
@ChrisRose @KateUpton when she tweets it
@mmolina15 Bengie
@manuelrajunov Top 5 guys I pitched to.
@CalebDunlop13 i pitched to pudge and sandy alomar jr too but not enough innings with either really.
@CalebDunlop13 receiving skills, game management, let me call my own game.   Trading Conger was a massive mistake for pitching staff
Molina, Traynor, Conger https://t.co/ghdZ8iyZ1X
@rmunoz562 @Buster_ESPN right handed not red headed LOL
@GlaserJoseph @Buster_ESPN some teams just think people are cheating.  Lots of guys try to peek
McCann has been velcro behind the plate.  Framing and blocking.  He’s dropping the heart rate for his pitchers for sure
@imchrism @Buster_ESPN huge muscles make him look closer
There is a PSA advertisement in there.   Ulcers.  Footwear.  Hand sanitizer. https://t.co/n4XjmUs6Tz
@mburchell trout is only close because he has shorter arms.  All muscle.  Too explosive.
@LyleMSpencer @FisherWritesMLB Lyle- some stadiums do a better job rubbing balls.  Umpires no longer hands on.
He only throws sliders https://t.co/Ef7oa5inHU
@Mikey_PCS i try to forget that guy
@GlaserJoseph @Buster_ESPN all series
@uelindsay @Buster_ESPN jesus i’m not old enough for that

@henry_faunce27 yes Joey Bats is so on the dish that he turns on everything
If peacock had more of a curveball- that was how Trevor Cahill looked when he first debuted.  92-95, double turbo sink, nasty change up
Kinsler for sure. https://t.co/krScFVFISa
@Buster_ESPN makes you super uncomfortable knowing that the outside corner is now down the middle reach
@nanadanon he might be 3 rally beers deep
@bklein06 @BenRogers he used to have a split/super sinker that was a huge equalizer for righties
@BaddHareDay right?
@hawaiigirl3 ahah
Who pitches after peacock?
@haley_jim no idea.   There will only be so many quality pitches he can generate
@LyleMSpencer manfred with mr burns “excellent” finger twinkles
@bklein06 @BenRogers the whole thing that makes Darvish a weapon: he has a ton of different pitches
@AnRam13 everyone tries their best but you can’t be outside of your normal self.  Easy to “over try”
@DiamondFischer i’m rooting for LA!
Sustained rallies in NL park much harder- NL game with pitchers who...no matter how hard we try don’t have Springer/ Pederson street cred
The Astros definitely took advantage on the miscues and there might be too much blood in the water for a dodger rally
@titanfan1024 @MLB i’m down for it
@BenRogers where is his CB?  That is the equalizer.   FB and SL only means you can eliminate one or other, sit on one, take huge rip
Peacock’s sinker/ changeup combo is extremely nasty.   Very hard to hit- ball moving all over the place and really gets guys to chase
Astros have a long night with a hostile crowd -  the fans next to bullpen will offer some colorful suggestions to each pitcher warming up
Kershaw’s drop down angle is basically impossible to hit for the Lefties. Reddick and McCann look completely uncomfortable and overmatched
@R_McKay1 too much redbull?
Definitely not the ideal start to this one for the home team
Keep your eye on the ball :( #WorldSeries
@BattingStanceG chris taylor’s eyebrows a key feature
@jro_27 sorry more of a “chill and not do much”
@etominovich hahaha
Joc’s “where did it go” oppo power is pretty ludicrous.   #GangsterHack definitely ran better out of the box after slow jogging other night
@UrKllinMeSmalls yes thank you!

@CoreycatesNTX sure ok
@mk9577 precisely
Altuve’s 0-0 and 1-1 swings look 100% reggie jackson #WorldSeries #GangsterHack
Altuve is such a tough out.  You just have to hope his overaggressive approach leads to a pop-up/ fly out.  #WorldSeries
Notorious MMA pinch running.  He can do anything #WorldSeries
@drstuarthoffman haha
@mk9577 yes i would just get angrier and more focused and keep trying until it stuck
@mk9577 @Decker6 I never threw a pitch without full intensity.   Felt like I owed that, and my opponents were too good to take lightly
@BenRogers FYI vizquel brought his pet Wallaroos to stadium.  They are 50lbs.  For scale.
@HustonStreet was the name Larry used
@xPMLx @HustonStreet coldblooded
@HustonStreet so did you throw any water balloons?
@bryanthewineman just sat on the couch and ate some cereal.  Point was game was too crazy and many risked death
Miata, e36, 944, tacoma PreRunner, RX8, https://t.co/waOM5bJBCA
@jakebentley1000 yes this series has seen a lot of mistakes followed by an extra base hit.  Bad bunt?  Next batter smashes double.  Etc
@kalvindfox exactly
@petehalvorsen @FOXLA derp
Belt high down the middle- springer has homered on that exact same pitch already but ball 4.  Bill makes no sense
McCann lucky that ball hit forearm first.   Otherwise shattered hand 100%
@RHeravi no- the average game in 2005-2007 from May-July was a 10-12 spot

Holy crap.  I have to put on a seatbelt.  This game has seen everything but a clown carrying balloons trying to steal children #WorldSeries
@mattjmanning333 nobody covering third because of shift
@Shawn_Foss he does-  nobody covering 3rd
Mental error right there from Springer.  Keep the ball in front, keep runners at corners.  Now Peacock could throw 30+ pitches
@ivanlu21 sinker, 4 seam, slider, CB.  No CH.
#WorldSeries https://t.co/VfkOVbFlWs
@JNickJay yes
@Chad13Stewart would have helped me tremendously.   I won a dubious award consistently: most squeezed pitcher in baseball/ most bad calls
@TheBrewersBest come out more aggressive?  Just throw FB’s and let amazing hitters tee off?
Never good.  #EnricoPalazzo https://t.co/U1BAYcoNBH
@ivanlu21 yes.  I could not figure out how to get Brian Roberts out, and in 2007 I tried it.  Used it all the time after that.
Getting amped up, overthrowing...feeling too strong...all play into the hitters.   Pitchers have to nibble and pitch to holes in swings.
VERY hard to pitch against same team just a few days later as a starter.  Definitely contributed to the lack of swing and misses, chases.
@JeremyAffeldt bill one of the worst and a grudge holder...how is he there?
When a guy fouls off multiple different pitch types you want to resort to something weird, like the drop down pitch.  Astros not chasing
Incredible at bat from Bregman.   Back breaking for Kershaw- tried those backdoor sliders and just could not get the bite back to corner.
Okay well Bill calling high strikes for both sides.
Curveballs to the scoopy swing.  Colin has a good enough high fb that that was a strategic mistake.
Brutal Bill strikes again.   Wow.  #WorldSeries
@markhoppus criss cut fries
@LyleMSpencer because that’s real life in MLB
@TheJordanMiller #gingerish
@Buster_ESPN could be related to Logan Forsythe
@haley_jim had to feed daughter.  Looking for more awesome kershaw- saw he had a lead to work with
Great thing about @LewisHamilton is that unlike most drivers- he’s not a robot; Bold, different and has a big personality- great for @F1
Mexico is now on my bucket list as an @F1 race now- the fans and venue look incredible.  Great to see fights for every position in top 10
Alonso is definitely not letting Sebastian pass.  Going to have to earn it.  Really wonder how long these tires are going to last #MexicoGP
Bananas start to the #MexicoGP - lots of popped tires and hurt feelings
@socaljb869 @KoleCalhoun have to try and get him down - he hits high pitches across zone.  Sinkers (as a lefty) in off plate, sliders away
@GeoffSilver big papi 4Eva
David Ortiz wins the suit game
@BillHelm42 hardest thing for me was managing my cartilage, or lack thereof
@Brad_Deuster @KoleCalhoun job of hitting coaches is to get the best out of your talent...strengthen your strengths
Laz continues to dazzle #WorldSeries
@BillHelm42 devenski seems to have more weapons that play
Joc has such a non-traditional swing.  Only a handful of LH’s in all of baseball can do something with that pitch- @KoleCalhoun is another
@sean_labonte @automobilemag passenger seat is pre heated and carpet is ugg boot liner
@LyleMSpencer 50/50 chance
Dodgers just took the closer out - now if they add on it could have a huge effect for the rest of the series.
@LyleMSpencer cuts down gangster hack into pro-laser mode.  Succeeds.  Succeeds again.
Hard to throw strikes, this guy is intimidating https://t.co/UzkdSLlmuG
@Paul_Maty i would have benefitted from auto/computer K-zone for sure
@LyleMSpencer can turner be a hero again?
@Paul_Maty imagine if he squeezed morton and wood- called all of those balls.    Game takes on totally different complexion.  Score 5-5
I wonder if Gattis ever snaps in the tunnel.   Not to stereotype but the beard makes me think he says funny stuff. #WorldSeries
@RoomFullOfEyes LOLZ
@Paul_Maty that’s my point
@realKeithK @ithrow88 @Buster_ESPN i don’t know if Timmy has 95+ in the tank anymore
@DMS5K don’t really remember.   Some of my best games I had Phil Cuzzi- he would actually call low strikes
@manuelrajunov we were talking about the world series
Laz has given: off the plate in, down away off plate, down in off plate, can’t be surprised by a hanger called for a strike
@manuelrajunov it’s ok to admit you don’t know how to calculate ERA
@manuelrajunov i exited game 1 after 5 2/3 IP, game was 2-2.  Ogando came in, gave up my 3rd run.   In game 5 i gave up 2 runs.
@ithrow88 @Buster_ESPN morrow has one of the best FB’s in baseball.
@artscience84 easier to hit 92mph cutters after seeing 97mph sinkers
@JWuorio47 overthinking it
@manuelrajunov i pitched 1 2/3 of relief on 2 days rest.
Always wonder about a manager bringing in a cutter guy after the sinker guy just carved up the lineup.   #worldseries
@manuelrajunov i threw 12-13 innings in the 2011 World Series
Great 2-Strike swing from Bellinger.   Good adjustment.  He got 3 really good pitches to hit that AB.   #WorldSeries
@manuelrajunov were you at game 1+5?  I pitched pretty well vs Carpenter.
Love catcher getting crossed up on a FB with nobody on base...
No doubter on a 3-1 offspeed pitch...Springer was all over that one.  Awful feeling as a pitcher for sure #WorldSeries
@RoomFullOfEyes rofl
@RoomFullOfEyes I mean, I wish I could pitch to the strike zone that Morton is getting here
Strike zone getting way too big here #WorldSeries
@taylorben @DASBUNKER yes of course they were
@pcg @Buster_ESPN I want to see Yasiel Puig pitching
@DASBUNKER balls are juiced and doubke short porches in houston...
@Buster_ESPN come on neither guy is going 7
@Mar_e_o17 hope so
Hard to not gangster hack in #WorldSeries    Joc and McCann both trying for scoreboard shots
Morton’s definitely not going to be giving in- it’s corners or nothing.   Laz giving low strikes...nibble or die trying #WorldSeries
@TheRealJGuts 85% he drills him in neck next year
@Ashley0906tt @annettemmm @mcguire28 sounds like you have an unreasonable axe to grind
@automobilemag guys have BMW badges on their suits
@Decker6 where should I return Reggie?
@StephanMSteele fair play indeed
@ktarq2 yes
@StephanMSteele that’s ballsy
@SkeerRacing nope.
@Bura13 @ClaytonKersh22 of course.
The Japanese fans, unlike a lot of “hey sign this card and don’t scratch it” type letters... they write about being inspired by the sport.
I cannot begin to imagine how awesome @ClaytonKersh22 ‘s Japanese fan mail letters are.   As an MLB player, truly a treat to receive them.
@MikeyY626 best pitcher in a generation. NBD
@ithrow88 @ClaytonKersh22 most talented pitcher but can he hit like 2004-2007 Dan Haren

@lexi5983 ceeeej
@ErikMellow hard to justify a gap if the round is a draw based on that.  Floyd won either way- no argument.  Had experience and stamina
@ErikMellow so then those would be 10-10 rounds or 9-9, one aggressor and one guy not punching/ not getting damaged...
@TheJordanMiller @jhullette well now that he is retired maybe some judges can leave too, let someone else try
@ErikMellow i know if a guy only throws 18 punches and gets hit 60 times he loses those rounds
@MoneymakingEd yes he did, he fought against one of the best fighters of any era.  Tall task.
@jhullette @TheJordanMiller well i'm not sure what to look forward to next.
@WhoIsAndrewJ @TheJordanMiller very entertaining fight.
@GloryFlow81 @NotoriousMMA some people said Floyd would smoke him in 2-3 rounds.  Was a better fight than 75% of stuff we pay for regularly
@WhoIsAndrewJ @TheJordanMiller does show a lot of bias if it is biased.
. @TheJordanMiller the only judge that was close to paying attention was TV dude.  Real judges were very biased- Floyd lost at least 4 rds
Enjoyed that fight- @notoriousMMA kept it really close until the last two rounds.  Seeing official scorecards though...89-81?  Come on
@JonLeeMiller @IMSA fantastic.

@pdow13 true!  Also easier in street car on street tires, 20-30mph can be all you need to learn this stuff
@FreddyWanKenobi @Angels yeah I know.  Take some of my mazdas out and slide around in the rain to learn, right?
@Decker6 @heelsonthefield some/most MiLB players never earn more than the poverty level in their 2-5 year career TOTAL
@Decker6 @heelsonthefield the best part is that the local teams don't pay the players, their salary comes from MLB Teams.
