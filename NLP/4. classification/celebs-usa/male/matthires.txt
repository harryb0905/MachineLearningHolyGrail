I updated this playlist, if you’re looking for some new songs/artists to get into. https://t.co/tGSmqzXDKG
@rockinrobi92 Was this in Chattanooga?

@sooper_whit Any hurricanes between Pittsburgh and Nashville?
@bmoorevisuals Sirens up by us, too. @kylecox told me they all go off at once, not just in the specific area with a tornado warning.
@PaulFletcher971 ❤️❤️❤️

@_DaveyRussell @volunteersounds @Tweet_Dec @kalesalad Guarantee
@eilla87 We’re playing a house show there on the 13th!
@J_Glass_ @MikeBrandesAV Sent you a message.
@volunteersounds Because this tweet rhymes, I’m just going to assume that it’s a lyric in one of your new songs.
Looking for some of you wonderful people to host a few house shows coming up in mid-March! Send me a message if you’d like to host in any of the following cities:  Tallahassee, Tampa, Orlando, Gainesville, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Knoxville.
@WilliamMatt22 Dude. This whole album.
I’m 20 seconds into the new episode of Crashing, and I’ve never related to anything in a tv show more than @peteholmes touring alone and reading road signs aloud to himself in a random accent.
@davidchang @uglydelicious Well deserved. I’ve watched it three times.
Salsa 24:7 🙏🏼 https://t.co/tSDYiz67GO
@hannahnirmala @jamminjava 2010? Lose the tie, Hires.
@hannah_ilivia That was my favorite shirt for a while.
@ElliePerlMusic 😒
2009 https://t.co/ggRjnoqgMI
@PresonPhillips @bmoorevisuals Wowww.
@FaithHopeJoy Hahaha
#My1stConcertWas Audio Adrenaline. 1996. Right after “Bloom” came out. If you know you know.
@kylecox Was this a deleted tweet?
“My son don’t eat exposure” is the best line of 2019. https://t.co/IvbAVLfvhV
@jdeicher You’re just trying to make me feel better about my weird hands.
@mrjustincross Hahaha. I kind of love this.
@jdeicher Tell her the one my mom loves. About the clammy hands.
@oliviasomer Sometimes Luke likes to answer “Barbara”.
I know you’ve been waiting on the edge of your seat. Here are my top 9 favorite albums of 2018! (The last two are from 2017, but I didn’t get into them until 2018, so whatever) https://t.co/BF2fx1m7xk
@kylecox @rypod88 @blackswanerisms
@NicolaStudio88 No, thank YOU.
American Wilderness // Now available on 12” vinyl // https://t.co/FxpEhRGgua https://t.co/J0YvPzt6q2
@tylerrehm @kylecox Pretty much.
@tylerrehm @kylecox Read the paragraph on the side of the Monster Rehab can, and you’ll understand why I call it that. I still drink it, though.
@sacberg Yep. I had to put the digital version on Bandcamp before I release the vinyl.
@mkoiodndyo 🤖
@Overjoyed20 Thanks so much! Same to you!
@NishWeiseth Thoughts and prayers.
This tweet fully gets my middle school and high school self. https://t.co/H2E8DDw7e6
@kylecox Whooooaaaaa.
@PaulFletcher971 @PaulCharchian Does that mean you win the big pot???
@kylecox Watching The Office at the cabin?
@tylerrehm Gentlewoman? I kind of forget what kind of privates your dog has.
@jayduplass 💩
@tylerrehm What a fucking gorgeous gentleman.
@DanielDopp @fantasyfocus @theholdsteady @julienrbaker @MatthewBerryTMR @FieldYates @MikeClayNFL Looooove this.

@kristikday 🤘🏼🤘🏼
@kristikday Hahaha. I don’t think I got the chords right until the last chorus.
@MnHeatherLynne @PaulFletcher971 @Target @blueoctober @cubfoods I feel it right now.
@jdeicher Is the band fired after December?
@kylecox Wow.
Oh snap. That wasn’t even a typo. He thinks it’s really spelled “Smocking”. https://t.co/SJc3QGYL4q
@ryan_a_jones @Spotify @andrewmcmahon @mattnathanson @nickfradiani @bleachersmusic @jackantonoff Duuuuuude.  Love this.
@missymetz @Spotify Thanks so much!!!
Thanks y’all. 🤘🏼 https://t.co/jqRWe1wBZu
@dancrotts Daaaaaaaang.
Your new album is a Snuggie for the eardrums. https://t.co/xpt1f7Gkb4
@kylecox @volunteersounds @nickjonas What the shit?!?
@MusicNutMatt @GiselleUgarte @kylecox Bonus eats... Arnold’s, Mitchells Deli, Two Ten Jack, and if you want an interesting experience with good food options, Plaza Mariachi.
@MusicNutMatt @GiselleUgarte @kylecox Definitely. Don’t do Hattie B’s for Nashville Hot Chicken, go to Pepperfire or Bolton’s. My favorite restaurants are Peninsula, Husk, and Butcher &amp; Bee. Best cocktail spots are Fox Bar, Patterson House, and Waldon. Best dives are Dino’s and Dee’s.
@michaelgungor @mikemchargue Oh. Also Arnold’s.
@michaelgungor @mikemchargue Husk, Peninsula, and/or Pepperfire Hot Chicken.
Vinyl is coming soooon. #americanwilderness https://t.co/AgTbEOWUmE

@sooper_whit @peteholmes I wish.
@ElliePerlMusic 😘
@JoshuaKFletcher Wait. You’re in NY?
@ItsNickElam American Wilderness vinyl is coming soon... If your into that.
@laurennpeiferr Hehehe
@V_auth I wasn’t added to that one, unfortunately. :(
Only 4 preorders left! Get your direct to vinyl song before I record these tomorrow. https://t.co/m1jBsBXLxR
@psac42 I’ll have to see how long my set is! I’ll squeeze it in if I can, though.
@realJacobAirey @heckyessica American WiFi
@binguhm 😘
If you were wondering which song made me cry, it was this beautiful, vulnerable masterpiece. https://t.co/tUCw3asKsB
@binguhm Hey. I have feelings.
I kind of like that asparagus makes your pee smell weird. It’s like, “Hey, remember when you were healthy, like, an hour ago?” And I’m like, “Thanks for the reminder, asparagus pee.”
I like that music can still make me cry.
@NishWeiseth Oh shit. This may be my favorite one.
I’ve listened to this song 10 times today, and I couldn’t be more stoked to see @xboygeniusx tomorrow night. https://t.co/BmTNkayYu8
@RobertMoody0405 Nice. Which song?
@celticsfaninNH @thedavidcook Can’t wait! See you there.
Yooooo. My last tour of the year starts next week. I’m playing a handful of shows up in the northeastern U.S. opening for @thedavidcook and also sprinkling in a couple more while I’m out on the east coast. Check out my website for dates and deets! https://t.co/aNLvxQBdVJ https://t.co/O07UrGdoeH

@tjr601 Yep! I’ll see you in Jacksonville.
@storyslamadison @nickolasblazina @LittleFiresBurn Thanks so much. We had fun making it.
My friend @nickolasblazina and I had a good conversation on his podcast @LittleFiresBurn. I hope you’ll take the time to listen.   https://t.co/3NOmTKRsWC https://t.co/gJBDkN15l8
@CoriDori It’s a house show! Details can be found here: https://t.co/YbgwVQS2f7

@ryan_a_jones @redlobster Endless sharts.
@mlagr13 @kylecox @CoryQuintard Nowhere. :(
@br3larson Hahahaha. I support it.
@lovelybeachtown Hahahaha. That was such a dumb video. I loved it.
@kylecox Young Taco.
17 hour drive today?
@kylecox The blank was Phish in both of those scenarios, btw.
@kylecox Or 9: I’m not into __________, but that’s awesome that you like them.
@kylecox As a 9 who definitely doesn’t like all music, I think it would more like this:  9: Oh, you like ________? That’s awesome. (Secretly not into artist)
@kylecox 9?
@ClassicHoss Yeah dude! Glad we got to hang.
Heading home from another great house show tour. I’m constantly blown away by the kindness and generosity of complete strangers (and friends who used to be strangers) out here on the road. Much love to everyone who came out to a show. Stay open, friends.
You’re welcome. https://t.co/rHnHYmnpEC
I feel like this penguin in most situations. https://t.co/Bjh8Tfkc1J
@PaulFletcher971 I’d be into that.
@ashleyabdenour I support it.
@PaulFletcher971 Thanks for the shout out, my dude.
@thedamnwells ✋🏼What if you use a capo on every song?
@cities97radio @mlsmpls 😘
@VadipDundee Love seeing these photos. Things are going well out here!
@MonkeyGrass The dates haven’t been officially announced yet.
@derek_del Glad I was able to be a part of it.
@MonkeyGrass I’m playing in Dallas on October 12th.
@MonkeyGrass That’s amazing. I have some TX shows coming up in October. You should come down for one of them!
@kylecox I know! I thought it was funny to get a behind the scenes view of our text convo.
@kylecox Hahaha
@sooper_whit Yep! It’s an early one.
Happy 5 year anniversary to this beautiful baby! Sorry for giving you such a long name. https://t.co/M6uVGkN4Tb
@dvnmstrs Thanks! Be well, my friend.
@dvnmstrs Yesssss. I’m in the drive thru now.
@JasonIsbell I read this wrong at first, and we almost had some real issues.
@kylecox If Llewyn is still waking you up every night when he’s 17, I’d say that’s a real problem.
@mikegentes Definitely!
@samcstreet Yesssssss.
@kylecox I’d Airbnb my bathroom.
@kylecox Imagine knocking on a stranger’s door just to use their bathroom. And then you rate each other.
Airbnb but for restrooms. https://t.co/QvPRFQUORR
@MikeBrandesAV Hell yeah, it is.
@PaulFletcher97 I drove 11 yesterday. 🤙🏼
@chrisgarvin Feeling good today! 🤘🏼
@reedmurray Feeling better this morning. 👌🏼
I really hope I’m not getting sick the night before leaving to go on tour.
@JoshuaKFletcher Hahaha. We’re all Matts at heart.
I’ve literally never met a singer/songwriter who is not named Matt. https://t.co/VJbwraILD4
@EMSLawyer Agreed.
@MikeBrandesAV Dude. Love that.
The dates are finally locked in! Looking forward to playing out west again. All shows are “pay what you want”! Bring your buds! https://t.co/troFUr4AbD https://t.co/m3sXrH3TrD
@kylecox Based on what you made yesterday, I’m wondering if maybe there is actually ass in your meatballs. 🤔
@kristikday Thanks so much, Kristi!
@mkoiodndyo Maybe you should also live today like it’s your birthday?
@mkoiodndyo I mean, technically it’s late, but I still fully appreciate the birthday wishes. Maybe I’ll just live today like it’s also my birthday.
@FaithHopeJoy Luke has definitely gotten more protective of our house/property. He barks a lot more at anyone passing on the street or any noise he hears.
Muh dudes. https://t.co/e7nNmRZSyn
@ZRamsizzle Yesss dude. So good.
I added a bunch of new stuff to the “Songs I’m Into” playlist. Hit shuffle. Get into it. https://t.co/0S0xJP8TnD
@kylecox I can’t wait for real football season.
Person: So how’s being a new dad?  Me: Today I took more naps than my kid.
Person: So how’s being a new dad?  Me: Today, as I was changing my son’s diaper, I ad-libbed lyrics to the tune of the Duck Tales theme song. It’s called “Butt Tales”.
@Jtramme11 Hey! It’s just pay-what-you-want at the show. See you there!
@The1AdamRandall Fake Theocracy, here we are.
@volunteersounds Same.
Last chance! I still have a few dates open in August, if anyone out west wants to host a house show.
@mkoiodndyo 🤘🏼❤️🤘🏼
@drewholcomb Yep. No contest.
@kylecox Throw some fresh garlic, some sesame oil, sriracha, and an egg into that shit? Baby, you’ve got a stew going. #arresteddevelopment
@RachelPlatten Yessssss!
@volunteersounds Don’t you think those years were necessary to get to the place you are now, though?
@BrianLeventhal Dad life is great! Definitely tough at first, but once you start to see their personality start to come out it gets so much better. Hope y’all are doing well!
Also this song.  https://t.co/41IWy1sDk4
This song is too good. https://t.co/naipDhxTu2
@PaulFletcher97 Read the tweet. Skimmed the review. Haha.
@PaulFletcher97 Hahaha. Rachel watched it and said the same thing.
@MikeBrandesAV Yeah dude!
@jholden23 Possibly. Would you want to host a house show?
@Howster_1 October!
Coming at you reeeaaal soon. https://t.co/fXNg8lliEU
@kylecox Why you gotta hate??? I’ve enjoyed some of them. David Chang did a bunch of them, and it was great!
@drshahdpt Nice! I’ve had songs in four episodes.
@PhillipMScales Haha. At first. Not so much anymore.
@ChrisWHill @hannahschaef I’m a nine, but I fomo real hard.
@JoshuaKFletcher @eddiesattic @tylerlyle We get it. You own a tuxedo. 🧐
@cjmask Whoa. Overachiever.
@rypod88 Probably.
@PhillipMScales My latest bowl was the Tonkostsu with a spicy umami boost. Super good.
@ChrisWHill People didn’t get the joke because they were the joke.
@kylecox Haha. You were right the first time.
@megancrowley18 Yes! August 12!
The west coast house show tour is coming together. I still need people to host in Portland and San Francisco. Anyone interested??? https://t.co/CTQxc58neQ
@JoshuaKFletcher Bummerfest.
Hey party people. I’m playing at Summerfest in Milwaukee next week! Come see me at 12:30pm on July 5th. https://t.co/KWj8Ctrin9
@volunteersounds Sorry dude. As brutal as the latest episode was, I’m pretty sure there are still two or three episodes left in this season. https://t.co/MxhxklA6IJ
@PaulFletcher97 Nooooooooooooooooooo https://t.co/mL0qPcti87
@JoshuaKFletcher You could always go the frosted tips and cargo shorts route.
@drshahdpt Awesome! Let me know.
I feel like playing some house shows out west in Aug/Sep. Anyone in the Mountain or Pacific time zones interested in hosting??? Message me! https://t.co/bvTRpkJtue
Tweet of the year? https://t.co/O2yZTk5MM1
River’s first hike... to a river. https://t.co/6WvPsmMeIQ
@tylerrehm This. https://t.co/HuZt8GntNo
Thanks, Anthony, for opening our eyes to so many beautiful cultures and people throughout the world and inspiring us, through your work, to be (paraphrasing a quote from the first episode of Parts Unknown) “relentlessly curious and without fear or prejudice.” You will be missed.
Just in case the ancient Egyptians were right, please bury me with a Banh Mi from @MitchellDeli when I die.
@kristikday @kylecox Sounds like you need to see In &amp; Of Itself in New York before it ends in August.
@kylecox 🐝
@tylerrehm Tostitos Hint of Lime. The La Croix of chips.
@McRaeHilliard @kylecox And thanks for the good words you sent to 22 year old me.
@McRaeHilliard @kylecox Haha. That was right after I started using Twitter.
@tylerrehm  https://t.co/nw7hTLUwl1
The most important thread you’ll read. https://t.co/m7cK55v5MJ
@_jimmycoleman Thanks dude! Hope you’re doing well.
I’ve gone full dad. https://t.co/oPcv5VyGWY
@ChrisWHill I disagree, but at the same time I understand.
@ellianaak @bonjourimeric I think I’m okay, but I could also not be okay. Is anyone okay? Thanks @bonjourimeric.
Wait. I just dropped my baby for this? https://t.co/zdf44XiMoD
@hoodratsk8r Nice! Thanks for sticking with me. 👊🏼
Wow. 10 years on Twitter. When I started, I used to have to text my tweet to a special phone number from my flip-phone. #MyTwitterAnniversary https://t.co/ZhCKHuB3R0
@JoshuaKFletcher I thought it may have been something that was above my level of coolness.
My one month old kid just shat two feet. #ProudDad #DadTweets
@erictobiasIN Shoot me an email. matthiresmusic at gmail.
@peteholmes Every day since my son was born, I sniff the top of his head and think, “It’s like life itself.” So thanks for that.
@drshahdpt I’ll probably be playing some TX shows in October!
Has Filip Forsberg been asked to join The Avengers yet???
@ChrisWHill Billy Gilman follows me. 😎
@abizzle009 Why didn’t you tell me sooner?????
Buffalo sauce on scrambled eggs. You’re welcome.
@ZackDerksen Thanks! That definitely sounds like my thing. I’ll keep an eye out for it.
@ZackDerksen I don’t know much about Chattanooga’s beer scene, so I can’t argue that. Florida Cracker is probably my least favorite Cigar City beer, though. Try Jai Alai, Invasion, or Guyabera.
@nickolasblazina Seems like it. https://t.co/RRC0v0rc1p
Hahaha. That’s yet to be determined. https://t.co/OUht6g1YcY
Can we be honest with ourselves and just admit that we  put babies in little straight jackets and call it a “swaddle”. #dadtweets

@PaulFletcher97 That was so good.
@PhillipMScales @AtwoodMagazine @VAM_STUDIO Sounds badass, dude.
@ellieholcomb Thanks so much! Rachel actually had a couple of your songs on her birth playlist, so thanks for helping out!
@strxana @kylecox Hahaha. River already has a Predators jersey.
River James Hires. 4/10/18. Welcome to the world. Can’t wait to show you all the good parts. https://t.co/5ssQnOnJHu
@camilleaaker Hahaha. I won’t stop until I’ve liked any and every dog on the whole damn internet!
@PaulFletcher97 You know John Krasinski also wrote and directed it, right? Super impressive.
@PaulFletcher97 Dude. We just saw it, too. So good!
@CourtneyLiss Glad you had a good time! Wish I could have made it.
@CourtneyLiss I just saw that this is happening tonight, if you’re still looking for some good music. https://t.co/1LE4D6jMOT
@tylerrehm @PhillipMScales Almost. Goblet of Fire is fire. 🔥🔥🔥
@PhillipMScales Also solid. Which one?
@PhillipMScales Solid.
@PhillipMScales Wasabi Ramen?
@TappyTravels So I changed my digital distributor, and this happened to a lot of people. So sorry about that. Want me to send you a download link?
@CourtneyLiss Also, my favorite brunch spot is Terminal Cafe, my favorite sandwich is at Mitchell Deli, my favorite hot chicken is Pepperfire or Bolton’s, and my favorite dinner place is Butcher &amp; Bee.
@CourtneyLiss If you go downtown, you should definitely go to Robert’s Western World.
@volunteersounds @TylerHuckabee Damn. I wish this was fake.
@kylecox I might not be the first of our friends to go, but I probably won’t be the last.
@pray4ianG @gangofyouths @hnnahhough Ummm. Can I get one?
@derekwebb Haha. For me, it’s usually a day or two after. Such a bummer.
@volunteersounds Good Friday, M.A.A.D City
I’m glad he’s just outright admitting that America is his God. https://t.co/z8CcUIg7Zt
@PresonPhillips @reedmurray Their hashbrown casserole is pretty dope, though.
@dvnmstrs Glad you’re going! They put on an amazing show.
@ahartmann14 Thanks Alyssa!

@hmazeika Thanks Heather! It’s been a really fun tour. Hopefully I’ll be back through Richmond again before too long.
Sometimes I high five myself in the mirror because why the hell not.
On my way to the last show of the tour in KC tonight. Let’s doooooo this! https://t.co/D3HlNj2EKr
@daniiiileighhhh It’s a “pay what you want” kind of thing at the show.

Sad to hear that Stephen Hawking has left us. A Brief History of Time is one of my favorite books I’ve read. If you want to understand our universe more and have your mind blown every other page, I definitely recommend you read it, too.
@megan_leonard Thanks for opening up your home! Loved it.
I had an amazing time playing a house show outside Detroit last night. Only a few shows left! Moving on to Lake Geneva, WI tonight! https://t.co/hw3ZAuArJZ

Watching It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia right now, because it just makes sense. #superbowl
@kylecox @_DaveyRussell I got knocked out at James Brown.
@McRaeHilliard Soooo unfortunately, it was January 31st.
@Jtramme11 Hahaha. So good.
I think I just changed my religion in the shower. Converted to Dr. Bronner’s Soap Label.
@baywhite Thanks so much. American Wilderness is my favorite album that I’ve released.
@amandaotto129 It will be up on my tour dates soon.
@baywhite Daaang. That’s an old one. Glad you like it.
@amandaotto129 I’m probably playing a house show in Knoxville on Feb 23rd, if you want to come to that.
@wtmjackie Hahaha. I totally get that. I wasn’t offended, I honestly thought it was funny.
I’m almost getting into Asheville where I’m playing at Isis Music Hall tonight at 7pm. Let’s share some brews and tunes!
@Tquick101 @gangofyouths Shit. I guess I was robbed.
Actually, @gangofyouths was robbed. #Grammys
Kendrick was robbed. #Grammys
@PaulFletcher97 Kendrick was sooo so good.
Welp. I feel pretty bad for EVERYONE ELSE who has to perform now. #KendrickLamar #GRAMMYs
@AnalogRob Probably in the summer or fall.
@derek_del Some bullshit.
@SpaceJohnson @JerryFalwellJr Best tweet.
@nickolasblazina @mulaney That should happen more often.
It's been a really long time since I've done this, but check out my Spotify playlist! It's called "Songs I'm Into", and I'll do my best to keep it updated as I get into new songs. https://t.co/a8SkAx8AjW
@kristikday @andrewjamestx I don't think I'm going down to Texas on this run, but that could change.
@slobotski Thanks Jeff! Let me see how these cities start to come together, and I'll let you know if it looks like I can get out that way.
@daniiiileighhhh I mean, I've definitely played in apartments before. Your neighbors would just have to be cool with it.
@mikegentes Probably not. 😬
@joenelleFutrell @vpellegri20 @marysteves92 @jhen44 Let's make it happen. What city do you live in?
I feel like playing some house shows in Feb/March. Anyone in the central or eastern time zones interested in hosting??? Message me! https://t.co/qLgYiH8lt6
@JoshuaKFletcher Probably.
I know I know. The symbol for house Gryffindor is LITERALLY a big cat. Don't overthink it.

@sethdunlap10 @realDonaldTrump Oh hi, Mike.
@MattHiresStTeam Doing good!
@MattHiresStTeam Hey.
@dvnmstrs So glad you like it. Honestly, I think it's my new favorite album of all time. The lyrics get better with each listen.
@JesiMari @ImpolitePod Glad you like the album! I guess I need to check out the podcast.
@daytrotter Hahaha. Thanks!
I recorded this a couple of years ago and totally forgot about it. Hope it's good! https://t.co/kddSA3D0FK
@joshleroes Thanks so much! I'm glad you told me. And thank YOU for listening to my songs.
@dvnmstrs Into it?
@therandallkent This would probably be a show that is more suited for Adult Swim than NBC.

@JoshuaKFletcher Sure seemed like it.
@sethdunlap10 I want to belieb, but I'm plagued by doubt.
How about in addition to the Golden Globes, we have the Groban Globes? Every award goes to Josh Groban and is also a statue of Josh Groban. @joshgroban #GoldenGlobes
@JasonIsbell Tampa Bay Buccaneers has a nice rhythm to it.
@PhilBarnesMusic Is this when Old McDonald's farm animals realize that they're food?
@derek_del And also when you read "being, like, really smart" in a Kim Kardashian voice.
@kylecox What about those of us who are neither, but also don't want to mute or unfollow you? #thesilentmajority

@kylecox @CoryQuintard @JoelAdamRussell I agree with these dudes. I thought it was really fun.

@CoryQuintard Yesssss.
So pumped to be playing the @30AFest on Jan 12-15 in NW Florida! Tix here: https://t.co/0xjYKqQlhM
@carmenmariah It is, for sure. The Rob Bell episodes are also some of my favs.
@carmenmariah Did you listen to the Richard Rohr episode? That's one of my favs, and I've gotten way into his books since I heard that one.
@carmenmariah I'm pretty pumped for his book.
@carmenmariah Yesss. Changed my life in a lot of ways, too. I listen to it all the time on the road. He's the best.
@carmenmariah Whoa. Are you a Pete Holmes/Crashing/You Made It Weird fan???
@Jtramme11 I can definitely hear it.
@Jtramme11 Haha. Nope. I don't think I've heard of them.
Bye, Barcelona. https://t.co/CDXUO8Ermm
Take me to church. https://t.co/qLRTPylw2W
@PaulFletcher97 Maybe not for you.
Bro-celona. https://t.co/IqxhRHcxQ8
Barcelona. https://t.co/trzQKGCt9v
@JesseWSpencer 🙄
@CoryQuintard @BrandenHarvey I second this.
Just saw a little kid in the Amsterdam airport who was dressed cooler than everyone in east Nashville combined.
You were pretty great, Madrid. Off to Barcelona. https://t.co/ln9Ply8WlB
🇪🇸!
Later, 🇺🇸.
@kristikday I will someday.
@Parulikesyou Next year, for sure.
@CoryQuintard @kylecox Cool. I'll pay you equally for the amount it cost me to read your tweet.
@kylecox @CoryQuintard What's the writer's split on this one?
@CoryQuintard Hahaha. It's really because I don't know what you're talking about.
@CoryQuintard Dude. I love you, but I don't think I can do it.
@Jemteamjeff Thanks so much! It was really fun.
@CIVILIAN_sounds More like 50.
@kylecox https://t.co/fXARJrFiZs, https://t.co/JvlWpydEdd, https://t.co/cjl7Catgxq, https://t.co/d7VHbgml24, https://t.co/j3xftGFzeU
@CbusApril @kylecox Nobody really knows.
@kylecox THE BIBLE. Ever heard of it?
I'm playing my last show of the year tomorrow night in Lake Orion, MI at @20frontstreet! Hopefully I'll see some of you out there!
@PaulFletcher97 Dang dude. I love both of those things.
@chancetherapper Room 104.
...Or did you stage this photo just to turn your daughter into a political pawn? https://t.co/ICMZuqnjJd
Wait. Wasn't that candy LITERALLY a handout? https://t.co/ICMZuqnjJd
@PaulFletcher97 Yessssss
If @HumanFlowMovie is playing anywhere near you, I highly recommend that you go see it.
@sethdunlap10 Don't mistake this for a joke.
@sethdunlap10 Dude. 5S is the way to go.
@sacberg I have. I'm just not great at singing falsetto live.
@joshforsythe @ippudony @InandOfItself RIGHT???
@SpaceJohnson @realDonaldTrump That was also my first thought.
@beliebersmum Nothing. He just kept licking his butthole.
"We don't lick our buttholes in this family." - A thing I just said to my dog.
MoviePass is the best.
@mikemchargue  https://t.co/naeT2pnUcm
@CoryQuintard @gangofyouths "You wanted to fight for a cause? Then go out and fall in love."
@SpaceJohnson @beckyandfrank I would probably follow that Instagram account.
Same. https://t.co/lpTVTaHUUp
@willmikkelson @CaityWrenn How do you know? Has she peed on her phone yet?
@sooper_whit They're all great, but Persevere, The Heart Is A Muscle, and Say Yes To Life are probably my favs.
@sooper_whit Persevere gets me every time.
@acemannw Haha. Sorry dude. You might be waiting a while. I'm not usually a huge fan of live albums.
@sooper_whit It's my favorite.
@sooper_whit Whoa. Have you tried the new Gang of Youths album?
@NolaJH @kylecox Nice!
@ChrisKDavidson Yep! You coming?
@ChrisWHill I would've guessed it was One Of These Days by FFH.
@kylecox Hahaha. Thanks dude.
It's been a whole year since American Wilderness came out! What's your favorite song? https://t.co/cWqyl2OItH
Still waiting on that U.S. announcement from @gangofyouths like... https://t.co/A2Pm02ETlW
@thedamnwells Thanks, brother. Back at you.
@thedamnwells I agree with this. Also, you're my favorite person I've co-written with.
Anyone else think Tony Romo sounds kind of like Badger from Breaking Bad? #PHIvsCAR
@MatthewBerryTMR Glad I read it, and I'm glad you're still with us. Life is short. Enjoy the time you're given.
@kla2348 Only a couple shows between now and next year.
@Lisa_Veronica Dang. I need that.
@ChrisWHill Have you been watching The Deuce? If you haven't, you should.
@haileyschmick @gangofyouths @Lightning100 Whoaaa. Love that.
@McRaeHilliard @beverlyhanks Love it.
@rypod88 Yup. Been there.
Walked into my room to find my dog sleeping on my bed with his butthole directly on my pillow.
In August of 2008, I stood with a friend amongst thousands of people in a field in Golden Gate… https://t.co/GYfV4IBlEq
Our time is short, and sometimes there are assholes who make it shorter. We're all in this together, friends. Go love someone today.
@vpellegri20 Thanks brother.

@ryan_a_jones My wife watches, and I've seen parts of about 3 or 4 episodes. Definitely teared up at all of them without even seeing the whole thing.
@ChristianHarger Oh, I've definitely sang Restless Pup before.
@ChristianHarger My go-to is "Baby, I Love Your Way", but with Lukey.
@DanielDopp @MatthewBerryTMR Yesssss. You don't have terrible taste in music, no matter what your coworkers say.
@derek_del Man. I live in Nashville, but I really want to try to get back for another show. Thank you for what you created.
If you're in or anywhere near NYC from now until the end of the year GO SEE THIS SHOW! (Thanks for putting this on my radar, @peteholmes) https://t.co/fJHjIDtNk4
@joshforsythe @ippudony @InandOfItself See it. Buy the tickets right now.
Taking myself on a date tonight in NYC. Dinner at @ippudony and then going to see @InandOfItself.
This dude. https://t.co/hnmlOQxI5A
There are only two types of people in the world. Those who think there are only two types of people in the world, and those who know better.
@mikemchargue Damn. Too true.

New York friends! I'm playing @RockwoodNYC Stage 3 a week from today. One of my favorite place. Come out and hang!!!
Yesssss. Nashville, please. https://t.co/pepuj29UKM
@kristikday @MattHiresStTeam I have that.

@Bella_Bassett1 I'm actually playing a beer festival at the Binder Park Zoo next month. I think it's in Battle Creek???
@LizzieBellman Drinks at The Thompson, 308, Attaboy, and/or Inglewood Lounge.
@LizzieBellman Breakfast/Bruch at Terminal Cafe. Lunch at Pepperfire. Dinner at Butcher &amp; Bee. If you're going downtown, Robert's is the place to go...
@DanielDopp Dude. If you're going to be awake anyways, you should check out the new Gang of Youths album. I think you'd be into it.
@kristikday @michaelianblack @BrucioMcCulloch I am! I haven't seen in a long time, but I used to watch it all the time when I was younger.
@michaelianblack @BrucioMcCulloch But I'm happy to find out that you guys are each your own person.
Whoaaaaa. Ever since I was a kid I thought that @michaelianblack was @BrucioMcCulloch. My mind is blown.
@barbaracraig Wish I could be there!
@mlagr13 Not this time! Hopefully soon.
@Howster_1 Yep!
Heading up to play at Door County Brewing Co. in Wisconsin tonight! Brewery shows are always a good time.

@d_buckmaster The pilot is just okay, but after that it's pretty great, if you stick with it.
Is Rick and Morty the greatest show of all time?
@PhillipMScales Farts.
@_mathiaas My fantasy team.
🏈!
@kylecox Could be both! Or 🌭🌭. It happens.
.@gangofyouths Any US tours coming up in the near future?
@The1AdamRandall Especially👏🏼when👏🏼you👏🏼do👏🏼this👏🏼between👏🏼every👏🏼fucking👏🏼word👏🏼.
@d_buckmaster @kylecox I played a full on Star Wars D&amp;D style game a couple nights ago, so I'm down for anything.
@d_buckmaster @kylecox Into it.
@SeanRuinsLives I could be a rapper.
Every day. https://t.co/tx2b6QE008
I'm playing at @thehotelcafe tomorrow night! Hopefully I'll see all of you Los Angeleans out there.
@shermenti Yeah man! I can definitely do that.
@SeanRuinsLives Maybe I'm sheltered from it, because of the people I surround myself with. Or maybe I'm desensitized to it, having grown up in the south.
@SeanRuinsLives I mean, in all honesty "Brentwood Statement" or "Franklin Statement" would probably be more accurate.
Not my #NashvilleStatement.
@RobertGillies I don't think so, man. Maybe next time?
Three shows in southern California coming up this week! https://t.co/YbgwVR9D6F  8/30 - San Diego 9/1 - Ventura 9/2 - Los Angeles https://t.co/s66NGVwvjB

This album is so good. I just randomly found it on Spotify because I liked the cover. You've gotta give it a listen. https://t.co/vFvLtRrDvL
@vpellegri20 @gangofyouths Yeah man. I'm into it. Any word on a house show?
Why didn't anyone tell me about @GangOfYouths??? I'm only 2 songs into their new album, but I can already tell it's going to be a favorite.
@ElliePerlMusic @kylecox @hannahmcLA Haha. Thanks.
@MikeBrandesAV Hahaha. That's where you discover all the best music.
@MikeBrandesAV Ask your mom.
@HaileyGoogles23 Bummerrrrr.
@HaileyGoogles23 Will you be back in Los Angeles by September 2nd?
@vpellegri20 Sounds good, man. DM me when you have some info.
@vpellegri20 Yeah dude! That would be great.
Does anyone in California want to host a house show August 28, 29, 31, or September 1?
@paigethalia Awesome! I'll probably need some merch help. See you there.
Same. https://t.co/x44aRghaOt
@kristikday Thanks Kristi. I am too.
@ElectricKiwi @Spotify Thanks so much!

My dog hits me in the balls at least once a day. It's like middle school all over again.
@grnbrwnfsheep1 I'll see you there!
Happy Rick and Morty day, friends.
@daniiiileighhhh Haha. Good. Because A to B is one of my favorites.
@abizzle009 Thanks Anna!
@sacberg Hahaha. I went for it with the stomps and claps on that one.
@psac42 Haha. Come On Get Hires.
@sooper_whit Thank YOU for being so supportive.
@mkvoller Those are two of my favorites as well. Stream on, dude.
@CoryQuintard That traitorous motherfarter.
@caulfeels Yessss. That was pretty fun.
@Brooks_AC Hahaha. You're allowed to like it.
@d_buckmaster Oh yeah. Forgot about that one.
@CoryQuintard Hahahaha
What's your least favorite song I've ever put out? I think mine is "Miles Past Midnight".
@kristikday No. But we're playing another show together on Wednesday.
@caulfeels Haha. That's awesome. Do you remember who was headlining?
Playing a fun little Nashville show with my friend Rocko Wheeler at Stacks on Main St. tonight. Rumor has it there will be free alcohols. 🍻
@NolaJH @Stephen_Kellogg Thanks for always supporting!
@Parulikesyou Thanks for coming out to my shows!
@Howster_1 Sorry to hear that, Howard. Thanks for always being supportive.
@ryan_a_jones Hahaha. I tried a couple of years ago, and I could get past the "in between" phase.
@AZHusker4Ever That was a really fun night. Thanks trying something new and hosting the show!
Thanks to all of you who have been listening to my music and coming out to my shows for the past 8 (or 9) years. For real.
@MonkeyGrass That's awesome. Thanks for that.
@MonkeyGrass Haha! Didn't you used to play this album in your FYE store?
@jessicalynn378 Thanks Jessica. Seriously.

@BlondeNinja221B @sherlocked57 Haha. I had almost forgotten about the alley show. That was fun.
@kylecox @willmikkelson He's my muse.
@willmikkelson You're such a bummerang.
@kylecox @willmikkelson Hahahahaha. C'mon guys. This is America.
@kylecox @willmikkelson Not sure how to feel about this, because I thought it was just an okay joke.
@fgonzalez1978 I definitely want to watch The Wire, but the people have spoken. Haha. The first two episodes of The Sopranos were pretty solid.
@willmikkelson We should develop the Instenneagram. A personality test based solely on your Instagram photos.
@SpaceJohnson Yeah dude. I've seen it already, though.
I've seen the first season of The Wire, but it's been about 7 years. I would probably have to start over.
Which HBO show should I start right now?
I'll be traveling through Texas next month with my friend and Texan, Rocko Wheeler. See you soon. https://t.co/sm5JianPUb

I had such a damn good time at @RockByTheSea. Now I'm headed to Bluffton, SC to play at @theroastingroom. FL next week. See y'all out there.
@acemannw Haha. I covered MGMT.
I really love @peteholmes' comedy, but his "You Made It Weird" podcast has changed my life. If you've never listened, GET INTO IT.

My dude @volunteersounds put out a new EP that should be a part of your life. For real. https://t.co/aTFIPNS1bA https://t.co/YyVAp0OhhD
I know I'm a couple hours late, but.......... #nationalsiblingsday https://t.co/l55zr5hTWW
@PaulFletcher97 @Russostrib Thanks dudes. Hopefully we can hang out the next time I'm in Minneapolis!
@kristinjblogs Yessssss. See you then!
@Sherm_20 Thanks for coming out!
Twin Cities! We're playing a surprise house show tonight, and there are only TWO tickets left. Get it. https://t.co/wdii5vr87d
On our way to the Twin Cities to play @TurfClubMN tonight. See y'all in St. Paul.
@MayBMockingbird Cancel your plans!
@MayBMockingbird Haha. You use the word "celeb" loosely.
@TheeChaiT I think doors are at 6.
@ToriRothman Not sure, actually.
@ToriRothman @Bandsintown I support it.
@kristikday @sooper_whit @kylecox It's a haul, but we could probably make that work on the 10th.
@sooper_whit @kylecox @kristikday If we're thinking about Memphis, we would have to do it on the 11th, because it's 12 hours from Minny.
Does anyone in Fargo, Sioux Falls, or Omaha want to host a house show on April 10th or 11th???
@kylecox Love that zoo.
@CoryQuintard Tard the Rapper.
Thanks for a great night last night, Columbus! Moving on to Indianapolis tonight and Owosso, MI tomorrow night. Who's coming???
@mary_sinnamon Sounds good!
@teresawelc Hey! I'm playing at Foster Coffee in Owosso, MI tomorrow night. You should come hang.

@CoryQuintard This is one of the greatest video clips of all time.
@BeccaLaButis Good to see you! Hopefully I'll be back before too long.
@Lex_Killah Haha. I just saw this, and I'm long gone. Sorry!
@Lex_Killah Too late. 😩😩😩
@ryan_a_jones @Wendys @McDonalds If Wendy is mom and Ronald is dad, that's an extremely disturbing couple.
@BeccaLaButis My friend @kylecox is on at 7, and I'm on at 8. Definitely tickets still available!
Headed to the Hard Rock in Pittsburgh tonight to play a show for @CureRockPgh. If you're around, come hang!
@AliceMaeW I can probably pull that off.
Just went to the Comedy Cellar and Louis C.K. Dropped in, if you wanted to know when I peaked in life. https://t.co/1EWtyAs4M6
@ianmahanmusic @pennylanehires Love it!
@willnoon For real. I listen to Payola all the time.
@fortune82 Thanks so much, Dan. Hopefully I'll see you at one of my shows coming up!
Such a fun time at the Ross Farm this afternoon. It's an amazing place to play some music. CT tomorrow, and then NYC! https://t.co/JzoeUQz8uK
@dinoman Hahaha. That's likely.
@dinoman I haven't yet. I've never really gotten into them, but I'll check it out.
@willmikkelson @CoryQuintard A f***ing friendship wizard.
This is true. Believe it. https://t.co/0yPUN9VgnZ
@davidkroll Haha. Thanks David.
@MarHan72 I'll be up there in a couple weeks!
@katiephalange Yep! Here's the ticket link: https://t.co/qxQIJPRF4f
@katiephalange It is! You should definitely come.
Anyone want to come to a last-minute Greensboro, NC area house show tonight??? I'll DM you the address.
I made a music video. https://t.co/PX2qnqaw6z
Tonight. Doors at 5. @kylecox at 7. https://t.co/bsnr97i5Bm
@MitchMosk Thanks so much, Mitch. It was a great piece!
I just watched Arrival for the second time, and I think it's my favorite movie.
Oh yeah. https://t.co/3dqCMdbxp5
Oh hey. I've been in Italy and almost forgot that I have a music video coming out tomorrow! Aaand my tour starts in Asheville on Tuesday!
When I first heard "Maybellene", it changed my life. I played it over and over. So long, Chuck. You'll always be one of my favs. #ChuckBerry
Sorry if I never come home. https://t.co/m3TyHXovpr
@joshforsythe @AlexDezen Hell yeah. Glad you went!

@bosepher Thanks for listening!
@Leah8123 Probably just straight up chocolate chip.
@PhillipMScales @kylecox @beatkitchenbar Into it.
@BrianBexley Hahaha. I'll have to get back to you on that.
Remember when I used to make some pretty cool videos to announce my tours? https://t.co/oweCwnk77I
@CoryQuintard @JoshuaKFletcher You gotta say a swear.
@CoryQuintard I want to live my life the way that kid walk into the room.
@kla2348 See you there! There isn't an official meet and greet, but we'll be hanging out.
@dinoman 👌🏼
@dinoman Dooooooo it. Seriously.
@dinoman That's amazing. And no, I've lived in Nashville for the past couple years.
@dinoman Are you in Australia???
Less than two weeks until tour! We've added a few more shows. Check https://t.co/YbgwVQS2f7 for details. https://t.co/kZQzOBq1z9
@MiloD That's awesome, man. Thanks for listening!
I hope for a day when we no longer need an #InternationalWomensDay. When the word "feminism" is obsolete. Until then, love, grow, press on.
@GavDaniels92 Thanks so much for that, man. I really appreciate it. I'm hoping to get back to Texas in June!
@OT5Lorak Haha. You're welcome.
@itsmilac Thanks! Same to you.
@itsmilac Thanks so much for listening! I'm releasing a music video this month.
@dan_rodriguez @welshlyarms Nice!I know a couple of those dudes.
@thetramcast Thanks so much for the kind words and for sharing my music with your listeners. Hope to see you the next time I play in SF!
@kolbydenham Thanks for listening, dude.
@thetramcast Thanksso much! Can't wait to listen.
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox I wish.
We'll be on FB Live in 5 minutes. @kylecox
Me and @kylecox will be playing some songs on FB Live at 8pm EST!
My upcoming tour-mate, @kylecox, and I will be doing a little Facebook Live thing tomorrow night at 8pm EST. Tune in.
My dudes @AlexDezen and @mikedunnusa are in Nashville tonight at @thehighwatt. I'll be there, and maybe you should too.
@MAGlCMEME Looks like we have Indy covered for the 2nd now, but I'll let you know if it changes. Bummer that you'll be out of town, though!
@cuddlesandpuns @CoryQuintard Fair enough.
@ianmahanmusic I think we actually have Indy covered, but Toronto could be great, depending on whether or not @kylecox can get his passport.
@BrianBexley We already have a house lined up for Columbus on April 1st! You can get info and tickets here: https://t.co/FPolUYach8
@Leah8123 Haha. Thanks Leah!
@MAGlCMEME @camstille April 2nd?
@kristikday It's in the works.
@Howster_1 @kylecox Awesome! See you soon, dude.
Also looking to fill in April 2-4 with some house shows. Indy? Cleveland? Detroit? Toronto? Message me.
Anyone interested in hosting a house show for me and @kylecox somewhere between Asheville and Raleigh on March 23? Shoot me a message.
@kylecox Well, he definitely wasn't as white as this dude.
Just sayin'. https://t.co/fJEwogvAJL
He's only missing his halo. https://t.co/Sxlu8iAHJB
@TornByDevin Dang dude.
Luke life. https://t.co/ySuhP0FKpb
This dude is amazing. This movie is amazing. https://t.co/SMTGrhITkg
@kristinjblogs Soon, I think?
@kristinjblogs Thanks for listening!
Coward. https://t.co/ADN4TXb0Of
I'm touring again this spring! My friend @kylecox is joining me on the Acoustic Wilderness tour this March/April. More cities coming soon. https://t.co/mWTLq7nlPw
@ellisgeorgia_ I could be down that way mid-May.
@ellisgeorgia_ Bummerrrr. Where will you be in the US?
@PhillipMScales Hahaha. I needed that little confidence boost today. Looking forward to hanging, man!
@CbusApril It was great to see you!
@Aaron_5280 Thanks for the heads up!
@vpellegri20 Niiiiice.
@TheeChaiT I was seriously JUST listening to @CoryQuintard's music and wishing we were back out on the road.
I'm playing with @Stephen_Kellogg over at @mercylounge tomorrow night. It's just my opinion, but I think you should go.
@kylecox https://t.co/iWa9Bvw5xY
@elizacopping Sorry! Someone else beat you to that one.
Did Adele just Brexit her album of the year award to Beyoncé??? #Grexit #GRAMMYs
Chance the Rapper is an unstoppable force. #GRAMMYs
@jlheiberg Haha. Neil Diamond even messed them up.
Beymomce! #GRAMMYs
Sorry, but #notmycountrymusic #GRAMMYs
@PaulFletcher97 Never.
Pretty much the only reason I'm watching. Can't wait. https://t.co/vLVuauITM4
@RealMikeMorrell Thanks for the follow, man. I'm actually halfway through The Divine Dance right now, and it's great.
DIY music video. #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/zCNBzgZQ9s
@SpaceJohnson This is great.
@Leah8123 I actually don't know any times yet.
@Leah8123 I'll be back on March 28th at Rockwood Music Hall stage 3 with my friend @kylecox.
@kristikday @kylecox We'll be up north then. :(
@kylecox Yup.
@kylecox I need you.
My dude @jdeicher is on a pretty rad #spotify playlist. Check it ooooouuuuut. https://t.co/4xjdA8aRku
Wait. Is he telling the court that he'll see them in court??? https://t.co/SMRzcHYsUd
@Lisa_Veronica Thanks Lisa!
@ZackDerksen Thanks so much for listening, Zack. That means a lot. Hopefully I'll see you at a show sometime.
@Humble520 Haha. I think you put more thought into it than I did.
Really pumped to be playing a Nashville show with my friend @Stephen_Kellogg next week! Thursday. Mercy Lounge. Beer. Songs. Funs.
We live in a society where TV ads that basically say "Hey. We're all humans. Don't be a dick. Buy some Coke." are considered controversial.
I honestly feel like it would be really healthy for America if the Super Bowl ended in a tie right now. #SuperBowl
@heidi_rene @CigarCityBeer Yup.
The beer gods have smiled upon Nashville. @CigarCityBeer https://t.co/FbtBRfmUxY
@kylecox I'm going to watch you watch @CoryQuintard watch you play songs.
Three of my favorite songwriters and all-around pretty okay dudes are playing in Nashville tonight. Come hang. 8pm. https://t.co/QoHv8poPpE
And I'll donate my share to @preemptivelove! https://t.co/FxpEhRGgua https://t.co/jKDeLNjZtM
@nickolasblazina @mrsdanablazina It's an odd one, for sure. But I liked it a lot.
@efeign It was great.
Although it didn't get a Best Picture nomination, I also really loved Silence.
I've ALMOST seen all of the Best Picture nominations for 2016, and I think Arrival is my favorite. What was your favorite movie of the year?
@danharmon Look who's purging now.
@AlexDezen @thedamnwells I like this concept. You should have more dialogue/debate between the two Twitter accounts.
Not a chance I would play cards with @DavidMuir. His poker face is 💯
@CoryQuintard Mark Wahlberg.
Don't Let Your Heart Grow Cold. https://t.co/nl5YJbAZLA
Hahaha. Too good. https://t.co/dTfNFlieko
@thedamnwells @AlexDezen Hahahaha.
@AlexDezen What if it's just HALF the chorus?
I'm generally good at spelling, but I don't think I've ever typed the word "guarantee" without some help from auto-correct.
Just hangin' with my alternative cat. 😽#alternativefacts https://t.co/NfryrBQlP7
@willnoon Zero dollars and about -25 followers, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
@AscherRobbins @HaloEleven @_WBF @ush1999 @NatInterviews Haha. I wish.
Dang. I got hacked, y'all. I'm not even a RayBan guy, but check @raen_optics if you need some great sunglasses.
@jessssMB20 Nope. I got hacked.
@AliceMaeW Thanks for listening to them.
My Jesus, I love thee I know thou art mine...  But sometimes it sucks to have to love you in America.
@thetramcast Thanks so much!
@PhilBarnesMusic Pepperfire is my favorite. I go for the medium if I want an enjoyable experience, hot if I want to bring the pain.
@Stephen_Kellogg @mercylounge Haha. Can't wait!
Chill master. https://t.co/a1jmmv87qe
@nickolasblazina @EatAtRosies @iamchrismullins I want this now.
@nate_pop1 For sure. I think my new album is available on Spotify overseas, if you want to check that one out.
@nate_pop1 Hmmm. It's definitely still on Spotify in the US. Not sure why it isn't available internationally, though.
@cayte03 Definitely!
@sooper_whit You're not completely off. It can be interpreted from a few different perspectives. That's why I like it.
@kylecox Part of me thinks that my dog is a shithead sometimes because he resents me for having his balls cut off.
I can't stop thinking about "Silence". I really loved it. Go see it.
@oxnicolexo Pretty much the same.
@Leah8123 I'll be back soon.
@sooper_whit There was a chain on it!
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Right. I'm just saying that listeners who use Spotify should find other ways to help support artists that they like.
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox I feel like at least getting a full cent per stream would be a step in the right direction.
@LeslieS4477 You guys do, and I'm extremely grateful for that.
@PresonPhillips Probably a good move.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! https://t.co/IeElKRsA8w
I think that was my very first Twitter rant. I must be getting old.
@ryan_a_jones Yep. That's why I don't think streaming music is a bad thing. It's a great tool, but it's not a great way to support music.
@kristikday You definitely do, and I'm extremely grateful.
@MikeBrandesAV That works too.
@joshlerotic I appreciate that a lot. Thank you.
Support art that you love.
I use Spotify to find music that I like, then I buy it on vinyl.
Streaming is a great way to discover artists, but it's not a good way to support art.
It's kind of insulting to see how little you get from streaming services for hundreds of thousands of streams.
@Taraustralis @Spotify Glad you're into it. Thanks for listening!
@The_Real_Parks Thanks for listening to it.
I just got a Golden Globe. Thanks Emma Stone. #GoldenGlobes
Daaaaaaaang. "Fighting A Ghost" crossed over 100k streams on Spotify. Keep it going! https://t.co/NOMYv9WPOa
@PhilBarnesMusic Definitely. One of the best movies this year.
@PhilBarnesMusic I just saw La La Land tonight, and it made me miss it.
@CoryQuintard Stop listening to music exclusively on Spotify and buy records. That turned things around for me.
@rypod88 ##
@moses_mastering 😘
@Leah8123 Just the Instagram one.
@CoryQuintard @robyngoestweet Yeah, but you guys left us for some damn musical.
My favorite albums of 2016. (I'm allowed to like my own album!) https://t.co/DZf19zWbsP
@MikeBrandesAV It's on my "best of 2016" list.
Are there any great albums that came out this year I may have missed?
Album cover? https://t.co/ABHKQo25Th
So long, princess. See you in another galaxy. #ripcarriefisher👰 https://t.co/Bw74Cu12MY
Thanks for the good words! https://t.co/KnTCrNplHT
I hope that for every Donald Trump there's a @chancetherapper.
Those @chancetherapper performances on SNL were incredible. I think I'd probably be a better human being if I watched them every single day.
@SpaceJohnson Got me.
@PaulFletcher97 I just hope that it's a good game and that the Preds get over 4 points, so I get a free Frosty.
@PaulFletcher97 I'm bringing some pretty hardcore Preds fans with me. 😬
@PaulFletcher97 And I also meant leaving the body.
@PaulFletcher97 No, unfortunately. I'm gonna see him tomorrow night and go to the game.
@PaulFletcher97 The best.
@Howster_1 Thank YOU!
@SwiftMariska Thanks so much! Glad you're into the music.
@Millerlite40 You should probably come hang with me and my crew in Nashville tonight. Lots of Denver folks over here. And chicken owners.
When you open the Dunkin' box, and it's bagels. 😭😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/gQeSJlk12s
@nickolasblazina Into it.
@TornByDevin I wish.
Pretty pumped to see @birbigs tonight. I've been a fan of his for a while, and this will be my first ever live stand-up comedy show. #laugh
🐶🐶 https://t.co/hx6RJB7p4u
If any of my Nashville friends are interested, I'll be playing a short set at @familywash tomorrow night! See you there.
.@adultswim This is you guys, right? https://t.co/FjFrNTMwhz
@PhilBarnesMusic Checkmate. https://t.co/q0gevPu9Ry
Great review of American Wilderness from @BlurtMagazine. Check it out here: https://t.co/TFPdsUynhf

Hey! Here's two years of my life for just $10.99! #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/Pve5qKsX1U
@daleedwards88 Thanks so much, Dale! Glad you're into it.
@Greg_Fairbairn Whoa. Thanks so much, Greg! Hopefully I'll see you at a show sometime.
@binguhm Haha. I agree.
BLACK FRIDAY SALE! My songs are available for fractions of a penny on all streaming services! #blackfriday
Follow @paprbckparadise and have your life significantly upgraded. You're welcome.
@PhilBarnesMusic Because you can eat 20 of them.
@PinegroveBand Sounds good! Cardinal is great.
I just got into @PinegroveBand today, only to discover that they just played in Nashville last night. 😑
Tammy the Turkey™ https://t.co/9lFwxbrYYf
@RoseSandyShore Thanks for listening to my songs!
@rapchatapp @MikeBrandesAV I'm thinking about getting back in the game.
@BuhbeccaBinks I have no idea how that happened. I like REM alright, but I never listened to them that much.
@carmenchz Thanks so much for listening to the music!
@justdoitrandom Haha. No worries. Check out the new songs!
@Lydia_Parson Haha. Thanks for listening!
@PhilBarnesMusic I get it. This is a comedy tweet.
@dancrotts @kylecox @CoryQuintard 😭
@kylecox @CIVILIAN_sounds Thanks, dawg.
Rage with me. Mourn with me. Hope with me. Go into the wilderness and come back alive. #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/D89flc9sQT
Wandering lost, in an American wilderness.
@Leah8123 It is. Probably won't be on Spotify, though.
Lots of white faces in red hats. #ElectionNight
@KetanJ0 @mikemchargue Yup.
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox That's what I would do.
@mikemchargue @michaelgungor Dudes. I've heard some good things about Chile.
Still waiting on Ashton Kutcher. #punkd #ElectionNight
@carmenmariah Florida isn't looking so great, either. 😩😩😩
@Leah8123 I hope not, because I live in Tennessee now.
To-Do for November 8th:  - Vote - Go to liquor store - Try to forget entire election cycle
I've got a show in Nashville this Thursday night with a bunch of friends, and I'll be playing a lot of new songs. 8pm at @thehighwatt.
@angertmackenna Thanks so much! I'm glad you're into it.
@ChelleLewis3 Thanks so much!
@IamObsoLeete That's really weird. I don't know why it wouldn't be there.
@IamObsoLeete Thanks, man! Is "Take Us To The Start" not on iTunes? I'm pretty sure it should be.
@willnoon This is the one place the  south has been (unintentionally) progressive. "Y'all" is a gender neutral term for a group of people.
@MorganCTheno It was @JesseWSpencer

@xtinaleblanc Thanks Christina!
@psac42 @RockwoodNYC Volunteer goes on around 6!
@EdwardorEddie @kylecox I guess I'm alright with that.
@EdwardorEddie @kylecox Hahaha. Don't call me that!
@_0livia_ My set is at 7, but you should show up by 6:15 to see Volunteer, if you can.
@mellynn_head 😞
@alejandromeola Definitely, man. You too!
@AliceMaeW I think so?

@lindseypoulter Thanks so much, Lindsey. Glad you're into it!
@camstille Volunteer is on at 10, and I'll be on around 10:45.
Hey Chicago! Let's hang tonight at @Schubas after the Cubs game, alright? Music starts at 10pm.
@DanielDopp I usually have a fantasy football nightmare the night before the first Sunday of the season.
@kylecox It's like you're staying at Sleep No More.
@Dang_Mexican Thanks Aryanne! I hope you like the new stuff too.
🙃 https://t.co/f1xR6Qpi6Z
The start time for the Schubas show changed because of the Cubs game. Doors are now at 9:30.  https://t.co/h9oauuZFi4
@SV_Photog Works for me.
Are you left? Are you right? Man, is God on your side? Seems like the wrong conversation. Just an easy way out... https://t.co/Pve5qKsX1U
@HARLEY_MUSIC Thanks Harley! Have you checked out the new album?
@A_M_Campbell12 Thanks Anna!
@PhilBarnesMusic Not at all.

Can't wait until Friday to listen to American Wilderness? Head over to @PopMatters and listen to it today! https://t.co/hkihbth1E2
The only Clinton-Dix anyone needs to be talking about tonight is in this football game. @haha_cd6 #SNFonNBC #debates
Unfortunately, we had to cancel the Atlanta show this evening. The whole band is sick, including myself. Hopefully we'll be back soon.
@ecapshaw It was great. Way better than the sound dude who has been there the past couple times. Sorry for being late!
@ecapshaw Sooo me and the band were listening to the "Woman" episode of The Liturgists and realized that you ran sound for us at Hotel Cafe!
@kylecox So then how do we know that farts don't taste amazing? 🤔

I'm announcing that I have some announcementy type stuff to announce this week.
I'm gonna be playing a bunch of new songs down at @thehighwatt this Thursday with my friends. Hopefully I'll see some of y'all out there.
@kylecox That's such a 4 thing to say.
I guess one perk about living in the Bible Belt is that pretty much every church is a Pokéstop. #Pokemon
I was never into #Pokémon before, but this new game is pretty sick. Especially for touring.

@GaronKae @PaulFletcher97 Haha. Nope.
@MinLee2 Unfortunately no. Just me and the band dudes.
July 4th was pretty okay, but the holiday I'm really looking forward to this week is @BasilicaBP. #praisetheloud
@BootsFactor They probably wouldn't be okay with a black president, but that's on them.
@GroversPhotos_ Haha. I wish that were true. But yeah, come to a show!
Pool time. #StayCool https://t.co/Cx54Y3aUez
@AlexDezen I like it, too.
I've been wanting to play @BasilicaBP for a while now. I'm so glad that it's happening this year. I'll see you soon, Minneapolis.

@Deadria101 That works.
@Deadria101 I could probably do that. Message me!
Just started to re-watch Breaking Bad from the beginning. 5 minutes in, and I already know this was a great decision.
@haleythrasea Thanks for the kind words.
@skyleralexa I'll be playing a LOT in the fall.
Record store loot. https://t.co/ZJduD6CnXd
@MikeBrandesAV Yeah dawg! I'm pumped.
@br3larson @BasilicaBP Yep! See you there?
Listening to mixes for the new album. I can't wait to share all of these songs with you. #AmericanWilderness
@PaulFletcher97 Hacked?
@AliceMaeW Haha. Like a taxi?
@MikeBrandesAV Haha. Less.
Tax Season: The time of year where I realize just how many times I ate at @tacobell while on tour.
@RickandMorty https://t.co/wH0YBjGcKb
@CoryQuintard P.S. Sorry for hijacking your heartfelt and honest post.
@CoryQuintard I tried, but @tedcruz said, "Tone it down, man. I think you love freedom a little too much." #🇺🇸
@CoryQuintard Ever heard of a little something called The Declaration of INDEPENDENCE, buddy? #🇺🇸
Thank y'all so much for helping me reach my goal on the RoadNation campaign. Can't wait to see you on tour in the fall. #AmericanWilderness
@sacberg No. Most of the cities on the map will be on the tour, as well as some others that I'll have to add.
ONE HOUR left on the RoadNation campaign! Thank you for helping me reach the goal. Still time to support! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
Just because we've reached the goal doesn't mean you can't still support a city. Extras are still available too! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
Dayum. Thanks y'all. https://t.co/5XxzSs2FgH
@dogriguez Thanks so much, Lori!
Ummmm. We're at 99%, y'all. https://t.co/VIsKQtsEQW
Duuuuudes. We're at 96%! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
Just about 18 hours left, and The American Wilderness Tour is at 94% on RoadNation. Let's hit that goal! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Leonardo DiCluckrio.
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Hennifer Lawrence.
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Reese Featherspoon?
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Hen Affleck!
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Jimi Hen-drix.
@kristikday It's gonna happen!
@kylecox James Van Der Beak.
@kylecox Cluckleberry Finn.
@ryan_a_jones @kylecox Nailed it.
@kylecox Then I feel like you also have to have a Kim Kardashiegg.
@DerekLocke14 Sounds great!
@DerekLocke14 I actually live in Nashville now! I'll be touring through FL in the fall, though.
Yes! It actually doesn't officially wrap up until noon on Tuesday.  https://t.co/qd1y6jSGmK
Minneapolis! I knew y'all could do it. How about the rest of you guys? Is your city confirmed for the tour yet? https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
@____melodie You're the best!!!
We're almost there! Reminder: Everyone who supports the American Wilderness Tour gets my new single ONE MONTH early! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
Playing a show in B-Ham tonight w/@jennyandtyler at Moonlight on the Mountain! It's been too long since I've been in the Ham. See you there.
Watching some late night McGee and Me. 🍻
Everyone who contributes at least $50 gets VIP status, which includes a meet &amp; greet and a 3 song acoustic performance before the show.
Y'all have been CRUSHING it the past few days on RoadNation! Thank you so much! Still THREE days to go... https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
Don't be an April Fool. Come see me play w/ @jennyandtyler in Nashville tonight! @thehighwatt. 8pm doors. $15. Fun.
@miss_veronicaa Thanks for listening!
@NGenaro28 Haha. Thanks for listening to the music!
@MonkeyGrass Thanks Randy!
Should I watch Ex Machina right now?
5 days left on the RoadNation campaign! The next 5 contributors will get the "Wish You Were Here" extra for FREE! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw
@kristikday @sooper_whit Unfortunately, no. :(
Me too! See you tomorrow, Atlanta.  https://t.co/cQfjiTB7g3
@Parulikesyou Thanks so much!
If you haven't seen it yet, check out my video I made for the RoadNation campaign... https://t.co/ffH7Re4KiH
MINNEAPOLIS! Let's make this happen again. Follow the link to help get your city confirmed. https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw https://t.co/0p7w7AiLO4
@bendyfeet One of my favorites.
@BLU_Denim_ Haha glad you like the music.
ONE WEEK LEFT! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the tour. Let's make it happen! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw https://t.co/pS4OXVLTM7
@willnoon Life is good, man! I probably won't be out west again until the Fall, but I just finished recording a new album. Pumped on it.
@willnoon Well, he walked through walls, so I'm voting for ghost Jesus.
@MikeBrandesAV Haha. One of mine. Sorry.
Everyone who contributes at least$25 to the RoadNation campaign achieves Roadie Status, and gets to choose a song for the show in your city.
Your life will resume after this ad.
@MorganCTheno probably.
Come on Minneapolis! You're getting so close. https://t.co/352pi7vnXW
Is your city confirmed yet for the American Wilderness tour? https://t.co/352pi7vnXW
My favorite dude. #NationalPuppyDay https://t.co/UEf69FIwjW
@Parulikesyou I'm actually not playing that show anymore. :(
@oxnicolexo Yes ma'am.
@rypod88 Your dog is a cat.
Want some handwritten lyrics? You can get that as an "extra" on my RoadNation campaign. https://t.co/352pi7vnXW
@HunterSharpless You totally captured what it's like to be on the road as a working class musician, and you also made me cry on a plane.
@HunterSharpless I FINALLY read "Song of the Fool" on a flight yesterday. Couldn't put it down. Such a beautifully honest work of art, man.
When you wanna send a snap to your friend, but it's only the 9th century. https://t.co/irDkslhodR
Me looking awkward next to some dude at the Colosseum. https://t.co/EwqJLeYveQ
When you're in the shower listening to your favorite jams, and you've just got to shred some air guitar. https://t.co/w1TQ0XvFdQ
@itsKizzleBtch Haha! Send me a message next time I'm playing in your town, and I'll get you into the show.
Me in a bath house in Pompeii. https://t.co/V2gJh8bosD
Bidet?
@schibbie30 I wish!
Oh hey, Sorrento. 🇮🇹 https://t.co/DdyqjHb7lH
Oh hey, Italy. 🇮🇹 https://t.co/mUp1miYMgC
@Howster_1 Thanks Howard! If you scroll down to the bottom of the campaign page, you can see the extras.
@sooper_whit Definitely.
I think my favorite extra on my RoadNation campaign is a disposable camera full of photos from the road. Check it: https://t.co/l0snwdNcAK
We're 1/4 of the way to reaching the goal! You guys are the best. https://t.co/l0snwdNcAK
@PaulFletcher97 @wildfeathers Haha. I'm down.
@rypod88 @JesseWSpencer Praise be.
@JesseWSpencer @rypod88 The Black Swan Rises.
@AliceMaeW Thanks soooo much!!!
@AliceMaeW Hmmm. That's sort of up to my booking agent because it has to work with all the other cities.
Want me to come to your city on my Fall headlining tour? https://t.co/l0snwdvBJc
@Lalaine_L I'll probably just be wanting some good sleep at the end of this drive.
It's a good day for a 14 hour drive.
Shooting some photos for the new album with @JesseWSpencer.
@CurtHensley Late night impulse buys are the best, man. That's how I have my bear costume.
@AscherRobbins Definitely, man. I would love to something when my album comes out this fall.
Heading to Denver for my last show of the tour! Can't wait to see some of you tonight at the Soiled Dove. 7pm doors. https://t.co/N9gt9ifIyS
@AlrightWithMe23 I did!
Heading up to Logan, UT to play a show there for the first time. Hopefully I'll see some of you out there!
@NatInterviews Can you send me a Twitter message?
@NatInterviews Awesome. Can you message it to me?
@kylecox Crock Pot pumped?
@calex318 Thanks for getting Los Angeles started! Seriously.
@rypod88 Already did that. Now I'm just drinking whiskey and watching Adult Swim. The usual.
@rypod88 LoL! 💃🏻
@petermatulis Hmmm. Is it not showing up in the extras?
@sacberg Awesome! Thanks.
@calex318 Haha. You could help make LA happen!
@sacberg Not sure. My booking agent will figure that out once all the cities are confirmed. Any suggestions?
@sacberg It's in play, but it hasn't hit $400 yet, so it isn't confirmed.
UPDATE: All RoadNation supporters will get the first single from American Wilderness one month EARLY! https://t.co/l0snwdNcAK
@NattyMat18 Haha. Definitely.
@NattyMat18 It's just me, but I think there's going to be a local opener. I'm not really sure who it is.
@itismoonlight Maybe someday?
@PaulFletcher97 Haha. Something like that.
@PaulFletcher97 Nope. I'm playing a show 4 blocks away from the Oscars!
My friend @luccadoes just released a new EP that you should get in your ears. Check it out here: https://t.co/WvtxPrE0cK
The Oscars are boring, and you know it. Come hang out with me instead. Hotel Cafe. 8pm.
@summersevilla That's pretty close, right???

My snap story today is video documentation of my slow descent into madness. #highwaymadness
@RadarEcho Yep.
@RadarEcho Roadway Inn. Classy.
@RadarEcho I've always powered through, but it's closed tonight. :(
@Stephen_Kellogg Haha. I'm in a Nissan Versa. It was pretty windy and kind of scary for about an hour before getting to Cheyenne.
I don't think I've ever driven across southern Wyoming without hitting some kind of sketchy weather... Or escaped prisoner alert.
Stuck in Cheyenne, WY because of 90mph wind gusts on I-80.
@Stephen_Kellogg I'm stuck on the other side of the closure. In Cheyenne.
@Stephen_Kellogg Damn. I'm supposed to be coming through tonight.
@Stephen_Kellogg Where is the road closure? I'm going to be heading west through there in a couple hours.
@PaulFletcher97 @pennylanehires @SpencerPelowski I already had seen it once, but it was just as good the second time.
All supporters will be able to get exclusive photos, videos, and updates from the tour I'm currently on! https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw

@Parulikesyou Hopefully I'll see you there soon.
@JFM I have a lot of driving coming up. I'm definitely planning on diving into the podcast.
@AliceMaeW Ugh. Probably.
Why does everything have to be an ad??? I thought I was enjoying a tribute to Bowie, and then it turned into an Intel commercial. #GRAMMYs
If Bruno Mars traded that gold chain for a cape, he'd have a pretty sweet Darkwing Duck costume. #GRAMMYs
New rule... Two random supporters from each confirmed city will get free tickets! Confirm your city here: https://t.co/VIsKQtKgfw

@maryannmarlowe @elly_blake Fall?
@maryannmarlowe @elly_blake Niiice. The old stuff?
@FuckTheFalcons See you soon, then.
@kristikday Hahaha. Now that's all I can see.
@FuckTheFalcons I forgive you.
@FuckTheFalcons All of that stuff is happening. I'll actually be in Seattle in a few weeks.

Back at it with @therandallkent. #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/EEHeQwHNoF
@PaulFletcher97 Have you seen Fargo?
Yooooo... I'm touring the west coast in just a few weeks! Check out all the dates. https://t.co/YbgwVQS2f7
@Parulikesyou At least by the Fall.
@willnoon I was seriously depressed after I saw it. I want to see it again, but I'm not sure if I want to be that bummed out again.
@kristikday It's getting up to 50 tomorrow, so it'll be turning into Slushzilla.
Snowzilla was the BEST.
I'm announcing that I have some announcements coming this week.
Nerd games. https://t.co/sNd3cFNWyz
@d_buckmaster This just means you haven't had real hot chicken. Come to Nashville!
@JFM @kylecox I've only seen the first season. I should probably try to get back into it.
Snow-ker. https://t.co/Qw7u3yHEaQ
@kylecox @ryan_a_jones The Killing is really good. Weren't you the one telling me about Banshee, Ryan?
@Gasolineheart77 @kylecox I've only seen season 1.
@PresonPhillips Hey man. We're snowed in. There's nothing else to do but take pictures of it.
@Gasolineheart77 @kylecox I haven't seen it, and I don't really plan on it.
@CoryQuintard @kylecox It's genius.
True Detective (season 1). Breaking Bad. Rick and Morty. Louie. Arrested Development (Or Fargo). https://t.co/Zb86AyAHK8
@jerseygolden He's a labradoodle!
Over it. https://t.co/lgi25lufci
Bropocalypse. https://t.co/2SS3sDoY5p
@Floridamomof4 Haha. Nope.
@maryannmarlowe I don't play here a ton, but a little more than I used to.
@maryannmarlowe Just over a year!
@maryannmarlowe Nashville. Did you know I moved?
Snowpocalypse. https://t.co/vGwpwsH8Sd
These are good dudes making good music. It's good, dude.  https://t.co/bdAagQV2tj
@realdiculous Bummerrrrr.
@AlexDezen @thehighwatt If you don't, I'm staying home.
@emilynava I'll hold you to that.
I have nothing against the dude, but if there's an appropriate time to use the phrase "I can't even", this is it. https://t.co/U8WKPWAQJE
The serious version... https://t.co/FVwrZ4WG0Z
@PaulFletcher97 Just watched it a couple weeks ago and loved it.
As you can tell by the look on my face, the recording is coming along prettyyy prettyyy well. https://t.co/uYQ1uXylsh

#AmericanWilderness https://t.co/BmMYPMhaBw
@AliceMaeW @sooper_whit Hahaha. Love it.
@sooper_whit @AliceMaeW Do it.
@Leah8123 Yes ma'am. Recording a new album.
Acoustic day. #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/BMo8esYtWt
@calex318 Yes ma'am.
Confession: Occasionally, I use my dog as a napkin.  https://t.co/orhlRRSXVQ
@sooper_whit Haha. There's part of a new song on my Snapchat story right now. Just sayin'.
@jenneee matthires.
Just so you know, Snapchat is probably your best place to follow everything going on in the studio... If that's what you're into.
@The1AdamRandall Thanks, man. It's gonna be different.
It begins. #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/EKd8gpjOva
Pre-pro drums, yo. #AmericanWilderness https://t.co/E7Mmm2dmiw
@sarahdivine When there's trouble, you call D.W.
I miss TaleSpin.
@oasis792 Thanks!
@dogriguez I hope so!
I'm usually really bad at titles. About to start making the new album, and I already have the title and a rough draft of the track order.
@HuskerinAZ98 I'm going into the studio on Monday to start the next record.
@HuskerinAZ98 I hope so! Good to hear from you, man.
Plus, you get a free download of my cover of "I Melt With You" when you sign up. https://t.co/tynA7x71U5
Tons of new stuff happening this year. Make sure you don't miss anything by signing up for my email list. https://t.co/tynA7x71U5
I miss Legends of the Hidden Temple.
@ninsterj Yep! I'll see you there.
Songs are weird.
@AlexDezen You just need to "Live. Laugh. Love." bro.
@joshforsythe I'm making it myself. We'll see about the release, but I'll probably be doing that on my own, too.
New year. New album. "American Wilderness" coming in 2016.
My favorite albums of 2015! https://t.co/fTgvPQATTk
@Brian_Yopp Maybe that's what I should call the album.
I'm starting on a new record in just a couple weeks. Can't wait to share these new songs with you.
Dreaming of a brown Christmas. 💦 https://t.co/EQ6Mi5yMQP
@caylobo_818 You know it. See you at a show sometime?
Be the void. https://t.co/92C1TUK7Q2
If @BrandonFlowers' "The Desired Effect" isn't on your Best of 2015 list, you made the wrong list.
@Laura_Staples27 Thanks so much!
@joshforsythe Thanks Josh! It's called "Don't Let Your Heart Grow Cold".
@FaithHopeJoy Next year!
@GERAEstack54 There's still time! I don't play until 10:45.
@mlsmpls I think I'm on at 10.
It's no Phantom Menace, but it was pretty good. #TheForceAwakens
Agree to disagree. https://t.co/qTyfKYEeH1
@miss_veronicaa #NeverForget
Heading up to Minneapolis tomorrow! Hopefully I'll see some of y'all at The Fine Line on Saturday night.
Hey. What was your favorite album of 2015? Need to make sure I didn't miss out on any good ones.
@SigmundBloom Would you play Stafford over Big Ben this week?
Just like I always say, 3/4 of a pickle spear is always the perfect serving size. @kroger https://t.co/2u89Sss0oo
My last show of the year is coming up at the end of this week! See you on Saturday, Minneapolis. https://t.co/fDYK2Mu92O

@AliceMaeW @sooper_whit @kristikday Haha. No acoustic album on the horizon, but I'm making a real kind of album in January.
@swenti I think so.
@swenti I think I play at 9.
@Raikou87 Bummer! Wish you could make it.
@swainer23 Hmm. I'm not really sure.
Chicago friends, I'm playing an acoustic set at Shubas tonight. Come hang out with me!
@megan_leonard 😩
@megan_leonard I'm playing in Chicago tomorrow night.
All I want for Christmas is season 3 of @RickandMorty.
@cristiehoff Haha. Me too!
@kylecox So happy that this is happening.
@dancrotts Haha. I think I need to put on some pounds first.
Black Fri-daze. https://t.co/trrAgF3MxD
Spooky scary. https://t.co/ynglbhhg17
Whack Friday. Amiright?
@MeowMeowMaddy I think I may be out there sometime in Feb/Mar.
@willnoon Last night I dreamed that Bernie Sanders came to my birthday party. He was a good hang.
@MissyRaasch Call in sick?
@TheRarmy_ Haha. Glad you're into it. Thanks for listening!
@dan_rodriguez @pepperfirenash My fav.
Biebs is saying he's sorry because he's wasting all of that water in California while they're in the middle of a drought.
Every time there is a music awards show, I ask myself, "How do we still let Chris Brown be a thing?"
Dang. Macklemore and Leon Bridges. Into it.
@StalkingKyle It's also pretty similar to "Style" by T-Swift.
@mikaelaLou_212 Haha. I'm glad you did, too.
@annahA216 @mercylounge Thanks! Move here.
Tomorrow night I'm playing a show with some of my best friends at @mercylounge. You should come, and we can all be best friends.
@maryannmarlowe It was incredible.
@danamelcher Haha. No pressure.
@danamelcher I'm playing in Minneapolis on Dec. 19th. Road trip?
@maryannmarlowe Not really sure. Hopefully next year sometime.
@maryannmarlowe Hey! I've been good. I was actually just touring up your way.
@kylecox YOU'RE BURNING BABY CHICKENS???
Stoked to be part of such a powerful project like the #Cities97Sampler. Includes an exclusive version of HoldYouUp: https://t.co/tfx5DIz33D
Guys. I can't wait for this show on Thursday night. It's going to be the best.  https://t.co/iH5JCc1vjg
@kylecox Sounds like she has a thing for old men. 👴🏻
@PaulFletcher97 Football.
@PaulFletcher97 Football.
@RachelPlatten I saw her about a month ago. One of my top 3 favorite shows.
@theendofamerica It's been good! Just two more shows, and then I'm heading back home.
@asianleprechaun What time are they playing? Unfortunately, I have to do a little driving after my show, but I would love to say hi.
Driving into Boston to play @clubpassim tonight. It would be bad luck not to come out to the show on this Friday the 13th.
@pennylanehires Start him. I dare you.
@kylecox That tweet from Bendis was awesome. He's one of the reasons I got into comics.
@misslujo Hahaha. I guess so.
@misslujo Post.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm really loving Snapchat. Follow me over there, if you want. matthires.
If anyone around Southbury, CT wants to come to the house show tonight, send me a DM, and I'll get you all the info.
@cayte03 Not really sure, but I'll see if I can find out.
@felicitygillies Niiiice.
@Stephen_Kellogg Haha. I was bummed I missed y'all in Nashville. Maybe next time.

@kylecox @rypod88 Haha. It makes you have an old smile?
@rypod88 This may be the blackest of all #blackswan tweets.
Tonight, I'm playing at The Moonshadow Cafe in Accident, MD on purpose. #dadjoke
Two last minute house shows booked in Hartford, CT and Rockville, MD! Details and tickets at https://t.co/j8FyddMc8U
@GemmaCaseyy Bummer! Check out my website. I may be playing some other shows that aren't very far away.
@HauteConfidante Thanks. Hoping that tomorrow is better than today.
@Mary_luvs_MB20 Hmm. That's weird. I'm sure you'll be able to get a ticket at the door, though.
@Hotwire Ah bummer. I used to prefer you guys over Priceline because of Hotwire Express.
Double-trouble. https://t.co/bJLXmwQ7Zt
@Hotwire I have used Hotwire more than ever this year, but it looks like I'm no longer a Hotwire Express member. Why?
@LeslieS4477 I'll be opening.
Driving all day to get to NYC. I'll be playing at @RockwoodNYC tomorrow night and Thursday night. Hopefully I'll see some of you there!
@melzapel Nope! I just don't think there's any pre-sale.
@robdelaney How much are you spending on these??? https://t.co/hhob21PfGM
I have a good feeling about this upcoming tour. https://t.co/8zvw9feLdp
Almost as good as it was in China. https://t.co/vWUPuKYSnw
@Mary_luvs_MB20 I'll see what I can do!
@thedamnwells Then why do you look so sad?
@Mary_luvs_MB20 At least you got back into the loop before it was too late.
I know it's sort of last minute, but would anyone in DC/Baltimore/Hartford/Providence/Portland/VT want to host a house show Nov 10 or 11?
@ChrisStanizzi I'll be in Boston in a couple weeks!
@lee19901017 I will definitely come back!
Last show of this little TX run tonight in Irving! Let's end this right. Hope to see some of you there. https://t.co/cRo7LnQ4iQ

@Jacei_Lee Haha. Where do you live?
@Jacei_Lee Dooooo it!
@TheShannonMac Haha. You should come tomorrow night then!
@TheShannonMac And don't call me Matty!
@TheShannonMac We're playing in Houston tomorrow night, but I assume you'll be doing wedding stuff.
