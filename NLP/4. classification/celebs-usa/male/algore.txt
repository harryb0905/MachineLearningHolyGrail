We’re hearing powerful testimonies here in Lowndes County, AL about the ecological injustices happening here and throughout the state. You are not alone. We stand with you and will continue to. https://t.co/ItaubQxXwZ
My tour with @RevDrBarber and @KarennaGore continues today in Hayneville, Alabama where we’ll learn from, and stand in support of residents suffering from exposure to raw sewage and coal ash. If you’re in the area, come join us. https://t.co/NcvvuQjEhM
Tune in now to join @RevDrBarber, @KarennaGore and myself for our public forum in Union Hill, VA: the Moral Call for Ecological Justice https://t.co/TEUTuVaruJ
For too long, fossil fuel companies have taken advantage of minority communities, exposing them to harmful toxic pollution. The historic Union Hill community in Virginia is fighting back for ecological and social justice. #WeAreAllUnionHill. https://t.co/RCciyqtV4M
The world recently lost two true giants in the field of environmental science and research. Here’s my statement on the legacies of Wally Broecker and Walter Munk. https://t.co/EEIikbQCbu https://t.co/Uf4TL7oULZ
.@dwallacewells' @NYMag piece sparked a crucial dialogue about the worsening impacts of the climate crisis in a powerful way. His new book #TheUninhabitableEarth has enormous potential to energize an even larger audience to act with the immediacy this crisis requires.
Proud to be joining @RevDrBarber and my daughter @KarennaGore tomorrow in Union Hill, VA to stand with this historic community fighting environmental racism. #WeAreAllUnionHill.  https://t.co/dvfhWCcZd0

Here's my statement on today's Green New Deal Resolution: https://t.co/s0TD90cRjd https://t.co/pemCfA8tRA
.@NASAGISS just confirmed that the past 5 years were the 5 hottest ever recorded. This also means that 18 of the 19 hottest years have occurred since 2000. It’s clear: The climate crisis is still getting worse faster than we are yet implementing the solutions.
The President doesn’t get it. Solar &amp; wind represent the fastest growing job sectors. Costs of renewable electricity are declining rapidly. There is a Global Sustainability Revolution happening &amp; he’s boasting about more dirty &amp; outdated oil and natural gas projects?  #SOTU
20 states have joined the @USClimate Alliance, representing nearly half of the U.S. population and GDP. Welcome IL, NM, and MI! State by state, Americans clearly want the U.S. to remain a leader in solving the climate crisis.
ICYMI: Great interactive reporting by @washingtonpost telling stories of how the climate crisis is impacting Americans today. https://t.co/6yv3aUZCoP
As scientists have warned! Record-breaking glacial melt from the Antarctic Thwaites Glacier is responsible for about 4% of global sea-level rise. Real News! https://t.co/hNuLPQn9Yy

The climate crisis is once again ranked as the top global risk by @WEF — after yet another year in which Mother Nature spoke to humanity loudly and clearly. https://t.co/NM6XeWnten
We can't accept this as a new normal. We have all the tools we need to act and solve this.
And this isn't going to make it any better: https://t.co/cZurqTezx2
The climate crisis is having a major impact on communities around the world, including those along the particularly vulnerable US East Coast: https://t.co/9c9kDoOnLr

Thank you, @drvox for this thoughtful dose of conditional optimism on the climate crisis. https://t.co/3xmMtZd4cl
On Christmas Eve, 50 years ago, our world was forever changed with ‘Earthrise’. After a tumultuous year, this powerful photo gave us a new perspective on our shared home. In 2019, let’s remember how fragile Earth is, and how much more we have in common than what divides us. https://t.co/04HzfKZvPF
The climate crisis is a public health crisis. I’ll discuss this growing challenge with thought leaders, celebrities, and artists tonight on @natgeowild at 7pm ET for @ClimateReality’s one-hour special of #24HoursofReality. https://t.co/tHg4pqpyGm https://t.co/llSiH4lrlX

The climate crisis poses a constant threat to global security. This is a threat that we face, not years from now, but today. We owe it to our brave soldiers on the front lines, and at the ready at home &amp; abroad, to recognize this threat &amp; act to solve it. https://t.co/kXmTueR7Ry
Leaders everywhere must listen to affected communities, support Environmental Justice, and act to solve the climate crisis! https://t.co/pTuJwJvHd1

I urge Colorado voters to vote #YesOn112 to protect homes, schools, playgrounds and other vulnerable areas from fracking. As oil &amp; gas spends millions to fight this, your citizen-led campaign can protect Coloradans and make climate justice history! https://t.co/UdXpnPy3z3
Tough times call for tough leaders. That’s why I, and the extremely talented @IMKristenBell, support @EarthForAmerica. Earth's policies on clean air, clean water, and green energy jobs protect our planet and everyone on it. https://t.co/7jNRdRYKGS #BeAVoter  #StandWithEarth https://t.co/BT2e9rpmnO
Glad to see @NewYorkStateAG has moved forward with a lawsuit alleging that Exxon Mobil fraudulently covered up the impacts of the climate crisis. Companies must tell investors the truth about this growing threat and the “Carbon Bubble.” https://t.co/ABmQwao9FH

Congratulations to my friend @RevDrBarber on receiving the prestigious MacArthur "Genius" grant! I was fortunate to stand beside him in NC with @KarennaGore to help end ecological devastation. Dr. Barber is an exceptional leader. Nobody is more deserving. https://t.co/TBbUaKjCKP
Another smart piece from @drvox showing how rising demand for clean energy is forcing utilities to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. This is the power of the marketplace. WE have the power to demand 100% clean, sustainable, renewable energy. https://t.co/wf0XnOALvh
Proud to be a part of the @GSGimpinv in India next week to discuss how leaders can tap into the potential of the Sustainability Revolution. And, as a side benefit, they can help save the future of humanity too. #PowerOfImpact https://t.co/KP7NzCu9L4
Important and inspiring leadership shown by the Marshall Islands -- from the frontlines of the climate crisis. Other countries can, and I hope will, commit to net zero carbon emissions. #ClimateWeekNYC https://t.co/qWdSssykFC

It's increasingly clear that we must urgently step up our commitments to solving the climate crisis. I look forward to joining @wef's #wefimpact meeting next week to explore how government and business leaders are doing just that. https://t.co/1xAWbUJ0QQ
“Rain bombs” fueled by the climate crisis contribute to flooding that has led to toxic coal ash flowing into a river in NC. Thinking of brave citizens I met w/my daughter @KarennaGore &amp; @RevDrBarber fighting for protections from this dangerous pollution. https://t.co/sVRGxlGEYV
Former Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd was a dear and loyal friend who served her district and nation with dignity and grace. She leaves behind a lasting legacy in Tennessee. I will miss her greatly.
My friend @traecrowder considered a novel idea for convincing people to care about the climate crisis. I favor a more constructive approach. Watch his latest “porch rant.” He has a surprise guest! https://t.co/wGek1k22Wi https://t.co/6xhypJYkk8
The Trump administration justifies its rollback of methane standards by saying it will be a cost-saver for industry. But what about the costs to our health, and the costs of the climate crisis? We need to put people and our planet over polluters’ profits.
Huge thanks to @JerryBrownGov for convening this broad coalition of ministers, governors, mayors, and business leaders from around the world for #GCAS2018 to ensure that we increase our ambition and step up our commitments to the Paris Agreement.
I commend @SenWarren for her leadership introducing the Climate Disclosure Act. Here is my statement: https://t.co/sCK2015Iif
Exciting news from my good friend @GovMurphy here at #GCAS2018! New Jersey is on track to reach the critical milestone of 3,500MW of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030. Wow! It’s clear that NJ is serious about addressing the climate crisis. #StepUp2018
Cities are on the front lines of the climate crisis. That’s why they are leading on solutions like building efficiency, zero-emission buses, and zero-waste. I'm thrilled to join @C40Cities and @Mayors4Climate at #Cities4Climate: The Future is Us today.
China has a historic opportunity to contribute to global economic growth through low-carbon development and is demonstrating its commitment to do so at #GCAS2018. It’s bold domestic action is an incredibly important signal to the world for our need to lower emissions. #StepUp2018 https://t.co/5h66yurZuc
Huge win for all who have been fighting to push #SB100 across the finish line in California! Congrats to @JerryBrownGov, @kdeleon, &amp; @ClimateReality activists who made their voices heard. Great way to kick off #GCAS2018! https://t.co/fDuXuW81TK

My statement on the passing of Senator John McCain. https://t.co/ZuM18FUo31
The Environmental Justice movement started in NC, where still today citizens suffer from exposure to toxic coal ash, among other threats. @RevDrBarber &amp; I visited these brave people last week. This is “ecological devastation” in a very dangerous form. https://t.co/Ldi65n4Unl
Well-organized event last week in North Carolina hosted by Rev. William Barber II​ bringing awareness to those affected by reckless coal ash storage and disposal. Thanks for having me share the stage with you, @RevDrBarber. https://t.co/11ylGmpgJY
The irony &amp; hypocrisy is breathtaking. Fossil fuel co's &amp; their cronies in Congress care more about protecting polluters responsible for the climate crisis than they do protecting people &amp; humanity's future. We have to change this! Register and VOTE! https://t.co/6TCh4cuyek
Today @EPA proposed a policy that would slow our ongoing transition to a healthier, carbon-free future. This is a failure of leadership &amp; vision. Those of us in cities, states, businesses, and NGOs will not be deterred, and will continue to build a stronger, clean energy economy.
.@KofiAnnan dedicated his life to working for peace and to ensure that we strive to maintain the highest possible moral standards while confronting our greatest challenges collectively. My heart goes out to Nane and his entire family.
.@ArethaFranklin was a unique thread in the fabric of our nation’s history. The Queen of Soul’s music played a vital role in uniting this country during some of our most trying times. She will be missed.
Encouraging news from @BloombergNEF: So far in 2018, corporations have purchased 7.2GW of clean energy, already shattering 2017's global record of 5.4GW. And we've still got five months to go! https://t.co/RYDpqVNALW
I am praying for the Queen of Soul and her family.
So inspired to see @RevDrBarber and @BRepairers's #MoralRevival impact here in North Carolina and @UniteThePoor's powerful efforts to give a voice to so many families who have been ignored for far too long. Join us for today's Moral Monday Mass Meeting: https://t.co/cM0kjkR1Ko
I'm near Belews Creek, NC talking with the community about the impacts of toxins from coal ash leaching into their drinking water. We must stop the burning of dirty fossil fuels and reckless dumping and irresponsible storage of its unsafe waste byproducts.
Excited to join @RevDrBarber and my daughter @KarennaGore for this morning's worship service at Greenleaf Christian Church!
Thanks @RevDrBarber for organizing this important tour. Looking forward to learning from communities affected by ecological injustice. https://t.co/Mo4ddcDUUz
My thoughts are with those affected by the historic wildfire in California, and the brave firefighters confronting it. Deeper droughts and longer, hotter summers – driven by the climate crisis – are making wildfires more common and increasingly worse. https://t.co/Oyzl7fPkhe
Cities, states, NGOs &amp; citizens are stepping up to #ActOnClimate. The proposal to weaken #cleanercar standards provides another pivotal moment to speak out &amp; fight back. Let our voices calling for a cleaner, all-electric future overwhelm the special interests.
Some of those most affected by the climate crisis are acting to solve it. Innovations in energy storage &amp; tech., &amp; increasingly lower costs for renewable energy allow places like the island nation of Palau to transition from diesel to 100% clean energy. https://t.co/P7uA1qZT0Z
If being “young and naive" is holding our leaders accountable and demanding a sustainable future, call me #YoungAndNaive. https://t.co/9SfsziEMFm

The economics of clean energy continue to improve, so much that the old narrative about “natural gas as a bridge fuel” is almost certainly badly outdated. Great analysis from the always insightful &amp; well-researched @drvox. https://t.co/6vT11dBc1X
To solve the climate crisis, we must lead from the state, regional and municipal levels. California, under @JerryBrownGov’s leadership, met its 2020 goal to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels 4 years early. Now keep pushing to meet that 2030 goal!  https://t.co/RVZPeXWkYd
Excited to see all of the governors, mayors and businesses around the world joining the #ZEVChallenge to spur adoption of zero emission vehicles! #StepUp2018 #EV100 @ClimateGroup @C40cities @GCAS2018 https://t.co/erMQtx5bjp
It’s important that editorial boards like @Guardian are connecting extreme weather to the climate crisis. Our democracies depend on media outlets informing the public with science and fact-based analyses. https://t.co/Jkb6ncmWWS
It fills me with pride and appreciation to hear what @ClimateReality Leaders have to say about our leadership trainings. I hope you can join us at our next one August 28-30 in LA https://t.co/dHF86dulRR #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/ak07lUPqDh
There are only six days left to apply for our next @ClimateReality Leadership Corps training in Los Angeles! I hope you’ll join me to learn how you can #LeadOnClimate:  https://t.co/KiZC7rY6is https://t.co/KWS7Q9mJ7C
Thanks to the journalists, advocates, and citizens for exposing Mr. Pruitt as a destructive, unethical, and wasteful head of the #EPA. We must remain vigilant to ensure EPA is held accountable for doing its job and addressing the climate crisis.
Washingtonians collected enough signatures to get #YesOn1631 on the ballot to price pollution. A special congrats to our @ClimateReality Leaders for getting more than 15,500 of the signatures! Important to take the next step and vote YES in November to #LeadOnClimate.
Montreal ambulance services have reached their limits due to health concerns from extreme heat. This heat wave makes it clear that city governments need serious policies for adapting to rising temps. If this can happen in Canada, it can happen everywhere. https://t.co/rac94ni20J
Here are seven great reasons to join me and our incredible team of experts in Los Angeles this August to become a @ClimateReality Leader: https://t.co/3hH00j8cjL #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/OFryDIf7WR
Congratulations to @lopezobrador_ for his election as Mexico’s next President. Earlier this year we met to discuss his commitment to the climate crisis. Mexico can and should play a leading role in driving clean energy solutions &amp; increase its ambition under the #ParisAgreement.
Proud of the important work the grassroots climate movement is doing in the Philippines to transition their country to a clean energy future. Big step in stopping a coal plant and new mining from going forward. https://t.co/yesYuDDzJh
Another ominous record has been set. The city of Quriyat, Oman, hit an overnight LOW of 108.7 degrees on Tuesday - likely the highest minimum daily temp recorded on Earth. For those suffering from the heat in the U.S. this weekend, be safe and stay cool! https://t.co/TizdAbAWLt
Thanks to everyone who took part in the training in Berlin this week! We need countries like Germany to meet their 2030 climate targets &amp; step up their efforts to #LeadOnClimate. Because of the work of @ClimateReality Leaders around the world, I'm confident they will. https://t.co/R2pZaZTDfQ
Under the strong leadership of @GovMurphy, New Jersey is primed to become one of America's biggest turnaround stories. All of NJ's elected officials must stand with him &amp; finally deliver on the promises they’ve made, including asking millionaires to pay their fair share.
Had a great conversation with @Patrickxander, @vixbwn, @Ischops &amp; @PaolaFiore on the origins of @ClimateReality and their personal experiences as Climate Reality Leaders. Keep up the great work as you continue to #LeadOnClimate! https://t.co/jydDNNlUvj
Congrats on the update to 'The Madhouse Effect’, @MichaelEMann! Can’t wait to read the new chapter. https://t.co/RdMy9uHuhB
Leaders in the Netherlands are moving ahead with a law to cut greenhouse gas emissions 95% by 2050. This sets a new bar for urgently-needed reductions. I’m in Germany this week w/@ClimateReality trainees &amp; to encourage their government to also take strong action &amp; phase out coal.
Powerful panel, at the Berlin @ClimateReality Leadership training, on how the climate crisis impacts human migration &amp; refugee crises around the world. Thanks @GaiaThinks &amp; Dr. Johannes Lelieveld of @maxplanckpress for being a part of this important discussion! #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/F05agQVRxq
We are all feeling worsening impacts of the climate crisis, especially the most vulnerable countries. Today we have new solutions to solve the crisis. We need to align challenges with solutions at forums like @TheCVF’s #VirtualClimateSummit and urgently step up climate ambition.
To remain a global &amp; regional leader in the transition to a sustainable future Germany must meet its 2030 emissions targets. Doing so requires phasing out coal &amp; increased political pressure. Which is why @ClimateReality is in Berlin this week training activists to #LeadOnClimate
We're about to kick off our @ClimateReality training in Berlin where 675 leaders at all levels from around the world have come to learn how they can #LeadOnClimate!
The German coal commission is critical to ensure the country achieves its climate targets with a #justtransition for workers. Germany should step up action or risk falling behind. Excited to be in Berlin w/ @ClimateReality to train activists to get involved. #Kohlekommission
This August, I’m heading to Los Angeles to train our next class of activists to become @ClimateReality Leaders. Apply to be part of our largest training ever: https://t.co/P4hSCL3Z3a #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/TQWzd6jOMq
Tearing families apart and putting kids in an Archipelago of Cages is not the America that we know and love. We are at a fork in the road: one way is right; the other wrong. The President is long overdue in ending this cruel &amp; inhumane policy.
This hits close to home. Literally. The Koch Brothers want more traffic jams so they can sell more petroleum. Then use profits to paralyze local politics and prevent solutions. Rinse and repeat. https://t.co/qnVPN52ulc
Good for @patagonia for giving employees the day off to vote in November. Others should follow their lead. We need to break down barriers to get more people out to vote and participate in our democracy. It’s more important now than ever. https://t.co/m4epIffJje
New, startling evidence of ice sheet melt in Antarctica that poses a grave threat to humanity. We have the tools to solve the climate crisis, we just need the will to act. Make your voice heard and get involved @ClimateReality. https://t.co/pXyn5wRa1U
You are an inspiration to all of us, Anwar. I know you’ll keep fighting for your core principles of democracy, and for a better life for the people you represent. https://t.co/j1sfiEdNQp
The market continues to favor clean energy over fossil fuels. Solar accounted for 55% of new electricity in Q1 of 2018. This is just the latest economic sign that we can solve the climate crisis. https://t.co/cIbK0g79Al
Our @ClimateReality Leadership Corps takes people of all backgrounds and makes them effective leaders in solving the climate crisis. Join us for our next training this August in Los Angeles: https://t.co/P4hSCL3Z3a #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/dvzdWplgol
My friend @JohnDoerr knows a thing or two about setting ambitious goals and achieving them. I enjoyed learning about his thoughtful approach in his recent TED Talk. https://t.co/SV4FNp266m via @TEDTalks
.@ClimateReality Leaders are developing climate solutions across the globe today. I hope you'll join our training of even more NEW Climate Leaders in LA this August! Be a part of this group of passionate &amp; committed advocates: https://t.co/P4hSCL3Z3a #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/wb2Q5i0FMq
I stand with @RevDrBarber &amp; the #PoorPeoplesCampaign serving the moral cause to end ecological devastation in America. We’re fighting for the people of Flint &amp; Puerto Rico and from across the country that deserve access to clean water &amp; to live in a healthy environment. Join us!
As the price of clean energy drops, investments in fossil fuels are risky and could be left stranded. Investors should take note of this @NatureClimate study, so we can avoid another global financial crisis. https://t.co/A8KBUSMg2a
In the noisy and crowded media environment, it is more important than ever to find effective ways of breaking through to convey crucial messages. That's why I'm excited for my friend Joe Romm's new book 'How to Go Viral and Reach Millions'. Check it out! https://t.co/E5JAQt3SAq
Today marks 1 year since President Trump announced plans to withdraw from the #ParisAgreement. Tomorrow marks 1 year since the rest of the world rejected this idea &amp; doubled down, &amp; American cities, states, &amp; businesses started stepping up to fill the leadership void. #StillIn
Glad to be part of a new collection of stories about the forging of the #ParisAgreement. Check out Profiles of Paris: https://t.co/J8vX4aJSFp #BeyondParis
Fossil fuels are subsidized 38x more than renewables globally. Now the Canadian government wants to spend billions more of taxpayer dollars to increase its country’s contribution to the climate crisis. This is not in the public interest. We must keep fighting to #StopKM.
The climate crisis is a public health issue. It’s important that former EPA Chief Gina McCarthy will launch @HarvardCCHANGE to build a healthier &amp; more sustainable planet. Watch the #CCHANGE event w/Gina &amp; @JohnKerry tomorrow at 1pm ET! https://t.co/v6L4OEIOTS
How can educators bring math and science to life? Through music and creativity! Great piece on @NBCNightlyNews featuring @OkGo (and my daughter Kristin’s husband, Damian Kulash) last night. Hurray OK Go! https://t.co/5YUhmBjzPN
We must, we can, and we will solve the climate crisis. I hope you’ll join @ClimateReality and me in Berlin June 26 - 28 for our next Climate Reality leadership training: https://t.co/mpkc6yaaLT #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/5a2GjaSGf1
Washington voters should vote #Yeson1631 which puts a price on pollution and ensures the state continues to be a leader in the clean energy economy. Kudos to the broad, diverse coalition working to ensure the most impacted communities share in these benefits.
Hurricane Harvey dumped as much rain on TX &amp; Louisiana in 5 days as the full flow of Niagara Falls over 500 days. The climate crisis is warming our waters, leading to more intense rainfall. A new study shows that seawater in the Gulf was nearly 86 degrees! https://t.co/ui6DYICTFr
Congratulations to the people of Malaysia and to my friends @anwaribrahim and @drwanazizah on your historic victory! Your dedication, courage, vision, and sacrifice are an inspiration to democrats around the world.
Good for @washingtonpost, exposing this pitiful attempt to downplay the threat of the climate crisis on our military and national security. Avoidance isn’t going to make the threat go away. In fact, it only makes us more vulnerable. https://t.co/QS8sHqv5No
The Kinder Morgan pipeline carrying dirty tar sands oil would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis. I stand with @jjhorgan, @MayorGregor, and all of the Canadians - including the First Nations - who are fighting to stop this destructive pipeline. #StopKM
It’s imperative that we all do our part to protect our shared home. Join me in Berlin June 26 - 28 to become a @ClimateReality leader: https://t.co/mpkc6yaaLT #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/wtboxQZXOV
More than 10 million people are now employed by the renewable energy industry, according to @IRENA. Just the latest proof that the Sustainability Revolution is the greatest investment &amp; job creating opportunity in history. https://t.co/ZAaPSzUMcK
CO2 levels in our atmosphere are now the highest in recorded history, going back at least 800,000 years, according to @Scripps_Ocean. More heat-trapping pollution leads to more extreme weather, like that recent record heat in Pakistan. https://t.co/1plUJ0V3k8
17 of the hottest years on record have been in the last 18 years. Nowhere is this more stark than in Pakistan, where one city recently reached 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit (50.2 degrees Celsius) – a new record for April. https://t.co/dDtkzvg61D
This June, I’m gathering climate experts and citizen leaders in Berlin for our next @ClimateReality leadership training. Apply now: https://t.co/mpkc6yaaLT #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/La2FUZQCmo
The climate crisis affects us in so many ways. Here’s another - our planet is getting warmer and that’s playing a major role in the spread of diseases. https://t.co/whpWAxMVxQ
I stand with @JerryBrownGov and the coalition of states standing up to EPA’s attempt to weaken greenhouse gas emission standards for cars. The climate crisis is too urgent to turn back. https://t.co/vkHD4NOIY3
Congratulations to my friend @johndoerr for all of the success with his new book “Measure What Matters”! https://t.co/Gcv1WLETHL

Thanks for having me, Mark, to discuss the exciting opportunity presented by the Sustainability Revolution! https://t.co/OMeYD8WHF1
Former First Lady Barbara Bush was a pillar of strength for her family and was much admired in our country. Both the wife and the mother of a U.S. President, she will be remembered for her service, pragmatism, and strong, kind spirit.
Thank you @officialjaden! You and other leaders in your generation ​give me hope that we will solve the climate crisis. https://t.co/XJbPBEh0a9
Looking forward to celebrating Earth Day this year with everyone @sachamamaorg in Miami!
Senators should reject Mike Pompeo’s nomination to be Secretary of State. He denies the climate crisis, and has been doing the bidding for fossil fuel interests his whole career. The American people deserve better.
Apple is proving the business case for reducing GHG emissions and simultaneously reducing energy costs. All of its facilities are now powered by 100% clean energy! https://t.co/TqhjtuM4zB
Important piece from @JustinHGillis about the threat of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The climate crisis is real and unequivocal. The President should fire Mr. Pruitt. https://t.co/o2d5wfeUbp
I will greatly miss Senator Danny Akaka. Here is my statement on his passing. https://t.co/kRYCVbQSE9
Shell proved to be prescient about violent storms resulting from the climate crisis in the 1980s. But they did nothing. We must demand better and shift to clean energy! #ShellKnew. https://t.co/1kQ2CwSkNo
Last year, climate-related and other natural disasters caused a staggering $306 billion in total damages in the US. Learn more about the climate crisis and extreme weather in @ClimateReality's free new e-book: https://t.co/GGyJthhHJn https://t.co/B2Hd5o0XWI
My friend @johndoerr has written a new book for teams that want to accomplish big goals. I look forward to reading it! https://t.co/V5ixWCe1CA
The carmakers are reneging on a fair deal – in order to be bailed out by taxpayers, they agreed to strong emissions standards. Following through on this deal is critical to responding to the urgent threat of the climate crisis &amp; ensuring that carmakers compete in future markets.
Looking forward to tuning into what should be a facinating discussion between Rev. Leo Woodbury, @RevYearwood &amp; @EJinAction! https://t.co/shx5PbrgTG
Proud of my daughter @KarennaGore and all 13 of the men and women who won in court, for standing up to fossil fuel interests with resolve. The Judge’s reliance on the “Necessity Defense” is an important precedent in our fight to solve the climate crisis. https://t.co/JOykcIS8Ga
Thank you to #CDMX for hosting this week’s @ClimateReality Leadership training, and big thanks to everyone  who came out from around the world and is now a Climate Reality Leader! Hasta pronto! #LeadOnClimate https://t.co/sCiJ4LBdeh
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend, Nancy McFadden. She was an extraordinary public servant whose wise counsel I relied upon for much of the last 25 years, including when she was my invaluable Deputy Chief of Staff in the White House. I will miss her deeply.

The number of cities powered mostly by renewable energy has more than doubled since 2015, according to @CDP, with many of them already planning to be 100% Committed by 2030! https://t.co/TY7Sc4sTLK
It’s concerning how warm the Arctic is right now, with record temps and low sea ice. As @thinkprogress says, what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. https://t.co/R3URlMrAE3
Rev. Billy Graham personally touched the lives, hearts &amp; souls of hundreds of millions of people with his determination to deliver the message of Jesus Christ. He was beloved by those transformed by his lifelong dedication to spreading the gospel. He will always be remembered​.
In India (7% of global emissions), wind + solar = 64% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @Mercomindia: https://t.co/8j2fth3iqT
In the EU (10% of global emissions), wind + solar = 77% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @WindEurope: https://t.co/wwaOL6mxwH
In the United States (15% of global emissions), wind + solar = 62% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @BCSECleanEnergy &amp; @BloombergNEF: https://t.co/r81tvC3tvS
In China (28% of global emissions), wind + solar = 55% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @rhodium_group: https://t.co/DrdNHsFYak
As clean renewable energy continues to grow at an unprecedented pace, the highest emitting countries are driving toward their #ParisAgreement commitments. In 2017, more than half of new electricity capacity in each of the top 4 carbon emitters came from #wind &amp; #solar.
U.S intelligence officials are looking at the science and warning about the risks of the climate crisis. Why isn’t the Trump administration listening? https://t.co/WNMuqtNemf
Important #cleanenergy progress coming from Australia. Solar power could double in capacity this year as the cost to produce it continues to plummet. https://t.co/v95C5loQCX
In Colorado and parts of the U.S, energy from solar and wind is now the cheapest source of power, even including the cost to construct new plants. Great piece from @hal_harvey and @JustinHGillis. https://t.co/0BKAECovHK
For Europe to meet its #ParisAgreement goals &amp; build a more sustainable financial system, it should follow the final @HLEG_Sus_Fin report.  It draws on the Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century project from @GenerationFndt @UNEP_FI &amp; @PRI_news. https://t.co/x2gqIrR6nf
There is no war on American energy. America should lead on clean energy! Smart leaders are tapping into this unprecedented opportunity. Doesn’t @RealDonaldTrump know that US solar jobs are growing 17X the average job growth? #SOTU
Great to see New Jersey back in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, under the leadership of my good friend @GovMurphy. States continue to lead in our fight to solve the climate crisis. https://t.co/3fICAIuzIA
I'm calling on members of @cducsubt &amp; @spdbt in Germany to phase out coal by 2030 in #GroKo talks. This is your moment to lead and help solve the climate crisis.
I hope Germany will commit to #endcoal. The coalition treaty is a chance to follow through on its climate promise and capitalize on the benefits of a clean energy economy. #GroKo
