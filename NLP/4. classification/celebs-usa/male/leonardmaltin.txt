I’ve been watching the Oscars since I was a kid and covering them since I moved to Los Angeles in 1983, so I can assure you that it’s not a cliché when people say it’s an honor just to be nominated https://t.co/rLUUawUPKX #MaltinOnMovies #AcademyAwards https://t.co/njxk4KjvUS
The Academy begs its nominees not to read from a list--but to let us all know how they feel in the moment. That's what #OliviaColman just did--and it was glorious. @TheAcademy #AcademyAwards #TheFavourite https://t.co/ypXJYhkbVv
We all know #RyanCoogler is talented—but you may not know that he is unwaveringly loyal to his @USCCinema classmates and colleagues—like tonight’s Oscar winner #LudwigGöransson. #BlackPanther #AcademyAwards https://t.co/qXuiGU5Sqt
#IntoTheSpiderverse knocked me off my feet. I'm so pleased to see this team honored with on Oscar tonight. #AcademyAwards @chrizmillr @philiplord @SpiderVerse @shameikmoore https://t.co/cqIWZnNpxm
#MahershalaAli is an incredible actor and an even better man. His passion, his talent--I look forward to many years of wonderful performances from him. #GreenBook #AcademyAwards https://t.co/l8cEuvavMa
Let's hear it for the beauty of black and white cinematography. Cuarón says he was channeling his great collaborator Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki. He did one hell of a job #Roma #Cinematography #AcademyAwards @TheAcademy @alfonsocuaron https://t.co/IRoc4dGGcd
#ReginaKing has always been terrific--and now at long last, she's got an #Oscar. Her performance in @BealeStreet is not to be missed. Bravo madame. @ReginaKing @TheAcademy #AcademyAwards https://t.co/rs1e5nS4t6
#StanleyDonen’s movies lift my spirits and leave me walking on air. With Gene Kelly he made Singin’ in the Rain and On the Town; on his own, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Two for the Road, &amp; many more. Talk about leaving a lasting impression. Thank you sir. https://t.co/XjJCPUf7K2

@jonmchu @jessiemaltin You gave a beautiful speech @jonmchu. We were very happy to be there
#MaltinOnMovies with @BradBirdA113! The director of The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Oscar nominee for The Incredibles II tells us about his first visit to the Disney studio—at the age of 11. His energy is infectious https://t.co/mFFH1bXihS @jessiemaltin https://t.co/8B8jqKnZlu

#DaveSmith was the ultimate Disney historian who invented his own position at the studio as archivist. He was enthusiastic about his work and generous with his vast knowledge. I always knew I could call on him and he never let me down. What a loss. https://t.co/Je1S5Y11yM
#MaltinOnMovies with @jonahray and #DeannaRooney: You may recognize this fascinating couple from the @MST3K revival. Los Angeles residents know Jonah best as the longtime host (with @kumailn) of The Meltdown. @jessiemaltin and I loved hanging out with them https://t.co/MJeu0hEaY7 https://t.co/DDGSsCvGor
'Alita: Battle Angel' isn’t cerebral or even highly original science-fiction. It’s sci-fi lite, designed to engage a young audience through pure escapism. I enjoyed watching it https://t.co/rbeNitLwNH #MaltinOnMovies #AlitaBattleAngel https://t.co/gy1nGna5jc

Folks are always asking us who we’d like to have on our podcast. @jessiemaltin and I would really love to celebrate more women. My wish list goes from colleagues like @jenyamato and @TheAmyNicholson to incredible talents like @DrewBarrymore and @maebirdwing #MaltinOnMovies
@jessiemaltin Can I guess?
That’s my kid. @jessiemaltin #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/FHgjmENwBn
Take a moment to remember the talented #ScottWilson. He made his mark as one of the stars of #InColdBlood and just kept working after that, aging gracefully into character parts. I always smiled when I saw him, most recently on an episode of @BoschAmazon. Rest In Peace sir.
The best compliment I can give the new version of #AStarIsBorn is that I didn’t mind it. The harshest is “forgettable. https://t.co/YANdU30kSK #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/l0SmI5R4mO
#MaltinOnMovies: He recited a short story by Sam Shepard word for word and loves every single aspect of the arts. #BoydHolbrook is as genuine as they come. https://t.co/o9cK8PYUry @jessiemaltin https://t.co/BZEHbTMPYl
Get your Leonard Maltin Halloween masks today! It also doubles as a John Landis mask #2for1 #MaltinOnMovies @jessiemaltin @TeePublic https://t.co/XoNWdzGmW5

This pretty well sums up what we thought of Under the Silver Lake... @jessiemaltin https://t.co/YMu4496E5n
@Gmas312 @jessiemaltin @LaurasMiscMovie @SidGrauman @LAFilmCritics @ClassicFilmRead @WarnerArchive @FilmStruck @tcm @AlfredHitchcock @OrsonWelles @ClassicalCinema Are you really going to speak to my daughter that way? Do you think that’s an acceptable thing to do?
@jessiemaltin And this was in LA.
'The Old Man &amp; the Gun' is a vehicle in the best sense of that term, a good story that showcases its leading man to best advantage https://t.co/e1SIrCClh2 @OldManAndTheGun #RobertRedford #SissySpacek #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/sobykk4sDW

Hiya Austin! I’ll be signing my new book #HookedOnHollywood over at @highballaustin as a part of @fantasticfest. Come on over and say hello #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/mX9xAJkilA
@PremiereFR He is still a movie star! He was nominated for an Oscar in 2014 for the innovative short subject Get A Horse
#MaltinOnMovies: #NormanLloyd is a living link to some of the centuries foremost filmmakers. A walking  compendium of great anecdotes with a twinkle in his eye.  I could listen to him for hours, and often do. https://t.co/x0ZMZJZQaN @jessiemaltin https://t.co/586WcXvVja
@jessiemaltin They took mine, too, but you don’t hear me complaining about it
My Alice. There’s only one. @jessiemaltin https://t.co/Tm5GsTt4sq
As usual, the kid is right. We’d be lost without our Alice. And after 43 years of marriage, she knows she’s stuck with me. Happy birthday my sweet heart. @jessiemaltin and I could not love you more. https://t.co/aCYJLAbu25

#MaltinOnMovies: Not since Norman Lear has one man had an impact on TV comedy as great as #ChuckLorre.

@allstarcustoms @jessiemaltin I love it. Thank you so much. A wonderful surprise
@jessiemaltin @MoviesMoviesMo4 I cannot begin to express how upsetting this is. I know Jessie’s ok because as she says, this is just twitter madness. Still.

@pegsatthemovies This has nothing to do with the president. Nothing to do with politics. Nothing.
@Elisecarroll18 I told her to ask me specific questions so I could be sure to include the information we needed to share.
Folks. We chose to speak up because we wanted to help our friends protect and defend their reputation. This is not about our president or politics. Please stop attacking each other, stop the name calling, stop the viciousness. Don’t lose sight of the actual issue at hand. https://t.co/NNUSxATf8E
I’m extremely uncomfortable doing something like this. I have no desire to fight or argue with anyone—but I must stand up for my dear friends at Boston Light and Sound. #MichaelMoore is slandering them—and I can’t stand idly by while that happens. https://t.co/Skw1saBSiW
Jess &amp; I had so much fun last night. What a passionate audience! @KristianHarloff and @markellislive (along w/their incredible team) put on one hell of a show.

@snakeyes12 @jessiemaltin @aliciamalone From Damien Chazelle: https://t.co/x3vQE4ZbMn
@snakeyes12 @jessiemaltin @aliciamalone Showing your patriotism has nothing to do with anything. Again, you’re making decisions and assumptions without seeing the film. And since you’ve blocked my daughter, I’ll share the quotes she found for you—because she’s trying to speak to you like an adult
Spending time with @LauraDern is one of the greatest gifts we’ll be receiving this trip. I can’t quite believe how long we’ve known each other—she remembers when @jessiemaltin was a little girl. As an actress she is superb, and as a person she is an angel #TellurideFilmFestival https://t.co/GvBomrsy2V
@jessiemaltin @C_Hardwicke @nerdist At least I tried
This is fantastic. Thank you @pauljarman. #Cinemen #MaltinOnMovies #TwoThumbsUp @ebertvoices @filmcenter @jessiemaltin https://t.co/V10mQ6nMCd
#MaltinOnMovies: #CatherineHardwicke started as a production designer, working with some of the top directors in the business. Since then she’s made all kinds of movies from personal projects like Lords of Dogtown to the smash hit Twilight https://t.co/N6PUehVY6a @jessiemaltin https://t.co/ffVVBMwsUF
A film that makes itself so predictable can only overcome this obstacle through atmosphere, performance, and abundance of charm or style. 'The Bookshop' has some of those qualities but not enough, sorry to say https://t.co/Q7YYQIbMe9 https://t.co/x4wmNOr2Ei

@jessiemaltin @BillNye It was both sad and hilarious
This is such a great exhibit and there isn’t much time left to explore before the auction. @jessiemaltin and I will be there all evening—and @floydnorman is one of the best storytellers I know. Hope to see you there. #ThatsFromDisneyland https://t.co/8p2uNbcTx9

#SpikeLee is an audacious filmmaker who crosses boundaries and deliberately blurs drama and reality.

@njcolbyco @MoviesMoviesMo4 @jessiemaltin To say you’re not angry when you’re addressing people this way—well maybe you should rethink your approach. No one will take your opinions seriously if you speak to them like that
@njcolbyco @MoviesMoviesMo4 @jessiemaltin She wasn’t snarky. And she replied to you, but you blocked her. She asked a simple question. What does box office have to do with a movie being good or not?
@njcolbyco @MoviesMoviesMo4 @jessiemaltin Why are you so angry?
@njcolbyco @jessiemaltin How is her question snarky? Some of you truly enjoy being angry
@jessiemaltin Thinking about all of you @ColliderVideo, @screenjunkies and @SchmoesKnow folks. A lovely man and a real loss
#MaltinOnMovies: Kelly Macdonald became an overnight sensation when she made a memorable screen debut in Trainspottingsome twenty years ago. She hasn’t looked back since. Her newest film Puzzle gives her  leading role and great showcase https://t.co/UmxXaraTgX @jessiemaltin https://t.co/VvXhLeg2De
'Love, Cecil'--Cecil Beaton is one of those names that rings out in any history of 20th century art and culture. This entertaining and candid film explains why. https://t.co/kRS0k27Q5h #MaltinOnMovies @zeitgeistfilms https://t.co/Nk5oj6o41N
'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again' is a visually appealing, thoroughly innocuous movie that you could safely take your grandmother to see. But I predict that it will have the staying power of Grease 2 https://t.co/CvviYCjG87 #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/S1MLRcVVCn

'Sicario: Day of the Soldado' falls far short of the earlier film. A fair amount of effort went into this production, but the results are simply unsatisfying. https://t.co/u9BvgKCAGP #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/gzcoHIFhJi
Remembering Harlan Ellison. https://t.co/wl9PNxaibe #RestInPeace #HarlanEllison
Feisty, furious, yet extraordinarily kind and generous; Harlan Ellison was one of a kind. He was family to us Maltins and our hearts go out to his incredible wife Susan. The world will be a duller place without him. #RIPHarlanEllison https://t.co/EaSF1iEOmX
Wishing this magnificent legend a very happy birthday—though let’s face it, we could celebrate @MelBrooks every day. The time we’ve gotten to spend with you over the years is something my family and I treasure deeply. #HappyBirthdayMelBrooks #MaltinOnMovies @jessiemaltin https://t.co/ljSAU7MDyE

#MaltinOnMovies: we’ve got a bonus episode for you. Jessie and I sit down with @GillianJacobs, @AlexRichanbach and #LaurynKahn to discuss their new @netflix film #Ibiza. Their enthusiasm and team spirit are engaging and inspiring https://t.co/O09WG89s6x @nerdist https://t.co/XKwymMPjdh
@tomisawriter @TheRickBaker Thank you for sharing!
Happy birthday Jessie Bear. You always make me and mommy so proud. You even taught me to photo bomb. Here’s to many more years of unicorn cakes eaten together as a family. I’m even going to use an emoji 🌈 https://t.co/QbTQlQtZSa
@jessiemaltin @Terrelli9 @aliciamalone @Journeys_Film @filmradar @sundancefest @TIFF_NET In fairness, I’ve only had to have emergency surgery at one festival. You and your mom just like to show off
‘Incredibles 2’ an entertaining, well-made movie that’s a model of family entertainment. Writer-director Brad Bird has come up with a fresh take on his ground-breaking story of a superhero clan https://t.co/atqcOL0KhK #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/WpSEjghPj8
#MaltinOnMovies: @jessiemaltin and I are thrilled to present our #FathersDay episode with Veronica and @TheRickBaker. Hope you enjoy https://t.co/0aeXnoNFVb @nerdist @DCComics @FamousMonsters https://t.co/5WOxDOhpUx

@jessiemaltin @neilhimself @ThatChrisGore @GeekWithAnAfro @FilmThreat @_MoviesTO_ @HTTTGAP @HTTTGAPmovie @A24 @ellefanningcom @ElleFanningIndo @mitskileaks @mypalal I second that
@chrisyogerst @CyrusNowrasteh Thank you Chris
@jessiemaltin Oy.
@jessiemaltin @LALGBTCenter @AnikaNoniRose @nerdist @JeffreeStar @mctd_support @lifewautoimmune @LupusResearch @SpooniesCouch @SpoonieSurvival @spoonie_life_ @StudioMucci I know it helps you immensely—but I feel like you didn’t need to do my makeup, too
@DrewMcWeeny @jessiemaltin One of the best. Such an incredible talent
@eddiemarsan You’re truly one of the greatest actors working today. And we’re very lucky to have you
Join me Wednesday night for #InTheHeatOfTheNight at the @acehotel (built as the United Artists Theatre by Mary Pickford in 1927.) A great film in a gorgeous setting. I’ll be introducing it for the @LAConservancy https://t.co/AtgotbRYK7 #MaltinOnMovies  #LastRemainingSeats https://t.co/GebeNbDeZp
@djpstoops @jessiemaltin So glad you enjoyed it
@TroyMP94 I can’t begin to tell you how happy this makes me
@Lilfilm It’s SO good. @jessiemaltin and I got to see it last year and kept telling folks it was our favorite film hands down
@jessiemaltin SEND HELP. WE’RE BURIED UNDER PIZZA BOXES AND CHINESE FOOD CARTONS
@MusicVideoSins The feeling is mutual
#MaltinOnMovies: @cinemasins (comprised of Barrett Share, Jeremy Scott and Chris Atkinson) have carved out a substantial niche for themselves on youtube and in the tiwtterverse.. They’re devoted cinephiles and some of he nicest guys around https://t.co/F7hHFP05y6 @jessiemaltin https://t.co/BvZLf3wdvL
Dinosaurs are dangerous and people are greedy. Got that? It’s the foundation of Fallen Kingdom. And if that mantra sounds way too familiar (and obvious), it’s the answer to why this film isn’t better. #MaltinOnMovies #JurassicWorldFallenKingdom https://t.co/B3XBoU2u5z https://t.co/niXS4r47I8
'Won’t You Be My Neighbor' is not a simple puff piece. Morgan Neville takes us on a highly emotional journey through its subject’s life and almost-accidental television career, which blossomed far beyond his expectations https://t.co/9XMUh5zuz8 @MrRogersMovie #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/SvjbbLUNUE
Mary Pickford’s ‘Failure’, Buster Keaton’s Rediscovery https://t.co/aqBySkbH4e #SilentFilm #BusterKeaton #MaryPickford #MaltinOnMovies https://t.co/dALDRgx6rV

@RogerCrow @edgarwright I’m so glad
#MaltinOnMovies: @ChazEbert is a force to be reckoned with. A strong, loving partner to her late husband Roger, she maintains his website https://t.co/F6IUqt31OA as well as his annual film festival https://t.co/QeUGLEd4sR #EbertFest @jessiemaltin @nerdist https://t.co/IdgwLSJBxv
'American Animals' smart entertainment, a nice piece of counter-programming in the midst of so many mass-audience blockbusters https://t.co/dEkpNwPbXe #AmericanAnimals @BarryKeoghan @AmerAnimals @BartfromRaw @Evan_Peters https://t.co/3gDfwVTAOA
@jessiemaltin @WDFMuseum @TWDCArchives In her words: I brought you into this world and I can take you out
We really do love this place. #WaltDisneyFamilyMuseum @WDFMuseum #MaltinOnMovies @jessiemaltin @DonHahn @DisneyD23 @DisneyAnimation @TWDCArchives https://t.co/gfe1URfrY7
The Walt Disney Family Museum is an absolute treasure. So happy we got to see @DonHahn’s #NineOldMen exhibit. @WDFMuseum https://t.co/aQadgBAD47
@YouDonKnowMe @jessiemaltin @DanielleHope26 @NetflixUK @GillianJacobs @vanessabayer @dopequeenpheebs @_richardmadden @AlexRichanbach @michaelaWat @WomenInFilm We’d like to have you lovely folks on the podcast if you find the time @YouDonKnowMe @GillianJacobs
@jessiemaltin @WDFMuseum @DisneyD23 @DonHahn Your mother says you’re out of the will.
Another full day for me at @CineventOH. You can join me at 1:45 for a conversation with @ScottEyman1 moderated by Caroline Breder-Watts, I’ll be signing more of my #HookedOnHollywood books at 2:45, then introducing ‘The Meanest Man in the World’ at 4:25. https://t.co/feo03JhjmA https://t.co/73PKXXD3uR
#MaltinOnMovies: @jessiemaltin and I were so taken with #NatalieDormer. She’s absolutely the real deal. You can check out her new film @InDarknessFilm (which she co-wrote) and her new show @hangingrocktv now https://t.co/SnbdEng5WW @nerdist https://t.co/5XiyM1QvZo
A few of you have said that my use of the term “reboot” is incorrect. I agree. I should’ve said prequel. My apologies. https://t.co/26VcotVndM
@jessiemaltin @DanCasey @Hectorisfunny @nerdist Looks neat. Congratulations @Hectorisfunny
If you’re going to try to reboot the Star Wars saga in a different way than anyone has tried before you’d better deliver the goods. Solo: A Star Wars Story does exactly that. I think the magic key can be summed up in one word: casting. https://t.co/ImXWstdiUH #SoloAStarWarsStory https://t.co/xYHybgk0EY

I’ll be debuting my new book “Hooked on Hollywood” this week at @CineventOH, a true moviebuff haven #MaltinOnMovies #MovieBuff #Cinephile @ScottEyman1 https://t.co/YRkSq9AEHN
#MaltinOnMovies: @jessiemaltin and I are huge fans of the #DuplassBrothers. Their new book #LikeBrothers is nothing short of exceptional. https://t.co/s65aL8ZdIP @MarkDuplass @nerdist https://t.co/PFXKQOx5Rv
@cinemasins @_MoviesTO_ @jessiemaltin @SinemaNashville Please. The pleasure was ours. We had so much fun

#MaltinOnMovies with @ShawkatAlia and #MiguelArteta. From Alia’s long-running role in Arrested Development to Miguel’s exceptional films like The Good Girl and Beatriz at Dinner, @jessiemaltin and I have so much fun exploring their careers https://t.co/Q63sa2zNWJ https://t.co/TcSSXNDHGz
@jessiemaltin Watching you hyperventilate is ever so entertaining
'Love &amp; Bananas' has a message to impart but it’s never preachy or pedantic. It accomplishes its goals with heartfelt enthusiasm. What more could one ask of a documentary? https://t.co/WKH4RXtcCk @LoveAndBananas @cfbp @ElephantNatureP https://t.co/FNnvzEoaAH
#MaltinOnMovies: We've got a special episode for you today. @LoveAndBananas is a significant documentary you need to see--and it inspired us to record with these young filmmakers in hopes of bringing attention to this worthy cause https://t.co/Hr5V1jBldU #ChangeForBalance https://t.co/fhVmRJh1lJ
@jessiemaltin This is why we keep you around
