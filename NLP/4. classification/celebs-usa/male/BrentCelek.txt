Everyone should follow @ProFootballTalk to get ur NFL news. The best!
@steveseiferheld they would benefit more if they didn't front money for the stadiums. Why do companies need gov't money to succeed?
@kxb220 exactly, but is that right?
5 hour flight. Continue this when I land
@jimcramer hey buddy. What's ur feeling on cities fronting money for stadiums in this economy?
@shwnlw0765 I understand but if no city paid u wouldn't have that problem
@shwnlw0765 so u mean to tell me that businesses should exist by the gov't supporting them?
@ProFootballTalk this is why our country has financial problems. It doesn't make sense. If u have a business it's ur job to pay for ur venue
@azelesko what I'm saying is no city should be allowed. Then u don't have that problem
Thank u RT @wjhorrigan: @BrentCelek you're not wrong; you are absolutely correct.
If anyone has a legit good reason of why I'm wrong then I would love to hear
Shouldn't be legal to do in any city. Not with our economic shape right now. But don't worry guys we will just raise the debt ceiling.
Guys I understand it brings a lot of money to the city but I wonder if microsofts buildings were paid for by the city. All I'm saying is it
Why do cities pay anything? Our country is has a debt of $14T RT @ProFootballTalk: Minneapolis poised to offer 25 percent toward new stadium
