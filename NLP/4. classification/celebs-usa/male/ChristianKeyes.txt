@holly_obama thank u...
@Larrylew do me a favor, separate me from that feed. I didn't say that, any of it… He did and whoever that is, they don't speak for me.
@GodIsLove247365 I appreciate the support but i'm pretty sure that members of the gay community don't appreciate being called the H word you were using… so perhaps consider not using it. Especially not while "defending me" please
@GodIsLove247365 addressing the issue is one thing… Using slurs and disrespectful language towards them is not necessary and not ok
This is the exact type of statement men have been making for years, as they sexually harass and intimidate women… The exact mentality… would you say "be flattered by it", "just deal with it" to your sister, your aunt or your mom? hypocrisy at its finest... https://t.co/Kc7AY3nysW

@OfficialSampson playing a gay character on the show doesn't mean that I have to get comfortable receiving penis pictures, inappropriate and vulgar sexual comments… If you are making excuses for this type of behavior, youre part of the problem.
@profoundboning or, they could just be respectful and not send me vulgar, overly sexual messages… That's an option too
@myusername4U_is "essentially insinuating", simply means you're assuming that's what I meant. It's not what I said or what I meant… I was referring to the people doing it
RT @holly_obama: @gaystarnews @ChristianKeyes Just be FLATTERED? That mindset right there. #EnoughSaid - exactly... I'm wrong for respectfully asking people to not send me inappropriate and vulgar messages… I should just #ShutUpAndDealWithIt

@harrine "Paris" isn't promiscuous… She's doing what she wants to do. That doesn't make her a bad person. It just makes her bold enough to do what the hell she wants. Women have been held to different standards than men for a long time. That's her choice. Why shame her for that?
