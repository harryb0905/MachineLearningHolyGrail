@scheana @Myspace @myspacetom Odds are it was either Glamorous by Fergie or Hollaback Girl Gwen stefani. Those two ruled myspace.
Julia Roberts is timeless.

@Beats1 @LaurenJauregui @travismills Great show today guys! X
@GreggyBennett So happy.....
@albinokid Ha, no worries. Yes all is good! Let me know when you’re back for some Pai Gow. 👌🏻
@glaad @RENTonFOX Finding @albinokid ‘s AOL email on the RENT site forum and nervously typing my way to coming out at 18. 💯
I eventually could speak and Anthony became a friend and helped me realize I was going to be ok, like he did for so many others. Forever grateful for those memories and that music.
I had the biggest crush of my life (at the time) on @albinokid - and when I finally met him after the show one night I could barely form a sentence. 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Being 18, coming to terms with being gay, and falling in love with that music. I saw RENT like 8x in 97/98. Always leaving class early to wait in line for $20 tickets and hoping my account wasn’t going to be overdrawn.
#RENTLive was giving me the feels and a jolt of memories.
@MusaTariq https://t.co/uk8TfpBprY
Contact / I’ll Cover You (Reprise) 😭😭😭 That was beautiful #RentLIVE @AllOfValentina
