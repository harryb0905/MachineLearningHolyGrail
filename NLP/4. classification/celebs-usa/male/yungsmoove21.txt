@ByrdMarkus @MNickTaylor @iamyoungty1 @10AM Facts.... lol
@MNickTaylor @JacksonTigerFan @iamyoungty1 @10AM Trust me tough decision ever for a 17 year old to make.... considering the schools i had to choose from ...
@iamyoungty1 Exactly, make your decisions based upon you and live with them. Don't let no one sway your opinion. I'm with you no matter what decision you make.
@DaJuneBug @MNickTaylor @iamyoungty1 @10AM Good luck with that ....
@MNickTaylor @JacksonTigerFan @iamyoungty1 @10AM U clearly know nothing about being recruited at all. Memphis has great players, but u got UNC, Duke, GT, &amp; other schools that put the time in that your home school doesn't. Hopefully Penny devotes his time/efforts towards not letting them steal more players.
@JacksonTigerFan @MNickTaylor @iamyoungty1 @10AM Still love memphis to death though
@JacksonTigerFan @MNickTaylor @iamyoungty1 @10AM Last time I checked I am 1 and 0 against u of memphis .... 2006 Maui ....sound like I made a great decision https://t.co/lTGmP6Y3jm
