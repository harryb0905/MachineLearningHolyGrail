Thank you for all your questions. Can't wait for you all to see #JungleBook. #insidejunglebook @bestbuy
@daddysweeney King Louie #insidejunglebook
@brettbmartin @BestBuy The cowbell. #insidejunglebook
@BestBuy I hope the pangolin is a favorite character. They are an endangered species and I hope we can raise awareness. #insidejunglebook
@gaynycdad @BestBuy I didn't read the book as a kid. I saw the movie a lot. #insidejunglebook
@BestBuy @BellaLayne22 All animal and Indian jungle locations were completely computer generated. There are no real animals in #JungleBook
@BestBuy We used tech like simulcam &amp; Pace 3D (developed for Avatar). Also Photon, Motion Builder. #insidejunglebook
@dodomesticdad @Disney WD was a great storyteller. He was drawn to adapting old folktales &amp; fairy tales using hi tech of his time.
@daddysweeney Murray is a hero of mine. He was extremely creative and improvisational. He works very hard and is full of ideas for dialogue.
@7onashoestring I did some mocap for King Louie and video performance reference for Baloo. I worked off of actors facial/voice performance.
@merlotmommy @BestBuy River rapids was the most interesting scene to film. Tank was constructed in parking lot. Water jets created current.
@BestBuy No. #insidejunglebook
@ckrusch Mowgli/Baloo relationship was my favorite growing up and the most important in connecting with the 67 classic. #insidejunglebook
@BestBuy Seeing what other films like Avatar &amp; Life of Pi did using new tech inspired us to retell the classic story using new techniques.
@BestBuy @mason_ireton King Louie was tricky because no orangutans in India. Changed it to a #Gigantopithecus. #insidejunglebook
@BestBuy My favorite #JungleBook moment was Mowgli &amp; Baloo singing Bare Necessities floating down river. #Insidejunglebook
@Miss_Red_Me The challenge was to find the proper tone to combine Kipling with 67 #JungleBook. Figuring out how to incorporate music.
@Monica_Cuddly #JungleBook was filmed in downtown Los Angeles. #Insidejunglebook
@jpeck1098 Not sure what project is next. Would love to explore using this technology to tell other stories. #insidejunglebook

@melloyellow48 Disney was passionate about JB &amp; 67 film is one of my oldest memories. New tech offers a way to tell the story in a fresh way
@UCFBiggie Cubano! #CHEF
@falcongunner33 Arri Alexa digital camera and the Pace system &amp; Simulcam (developed for Avatar) to capture the 3D. #askjunglebook
@OhMyDisney The craftsmanship of the artists. The singing and music are pretty cool too. #askjunglebook
@sammyzkay95 @TheJungleBook Iron Man gave me the most experience in the tech/animation aspect, but Elf taught me a lot of lessons in VFX.
@ConnorMcGinty We tried to record them together as much as possible. #askjunglebook
@MonkeyBoy1138 None are real. All are CGI. The whole movie was shot in downtown LA. #askjunglebook
@Bannerofff No. You'll see as more footage comes out that the tone is a mix btwn the original animated version and a modern action/adventure
@MyersFTW @TheJungleBook The photo real approach definitely amps up the adventure beyond the 67 version, but we wanted to maintain the fun.
@ScarlettJBrasil @TheNeelSethi She's the best! she has such a great voice with so much character. #askjunglebook
@DavidMacey1 A dream come true!
@TedLamy Yes! Movie was captured native in 3D. We are working on an extended dynamic range version to eliminate darkening from 3D glasses
@sunrarevival We used behavior &amp; mouth movements of real animals, not humans. Anim reference was drawn from performances and mocap of actors
@Warmustbeend123 We wanted to include enough music to satisfy people who grew up w 67 film but not make it a musical or betray action tone
@SolnSD @TheJungleBook @DisneyStudios @TheNeelSethi Ambitious! #askjunglebook

@mkabobo @iTunesMovies Anything @RidingShotgunLA cooked on the set was amazing. The grilled cheese was tough to beat. #AskJonFavreau
@iTunesMovies Lately digging Ali Baba. Really like how the song fits into the scene in film. I'm really proud of whole album. #AskJonFavreau
@iTunesMovies The last scene we shot was on top of the truck in #ATX watching @GaryClarkJr play. That was most memorable. #AskJonFavreau
@iTunesMovies Making a small film like #ChefMovie was similar to the experience of opening a food truck. Small scale but lots of freedom.
@iTunesMovies I didn't cook it in the film but I learned how to smoke brisket from @FranklinBbq while filming. #AskJonFavreau
@iTunesMovies The economics lend themselves to a single owner/operator. I have considered opening a restaurant though. #AskJonFavreau
@iTunesMovies The movie sparked my interest. I learned a great deal training to play a chef and I have continued cooking and learning since.

@jeremypiven Thanks bro!
Looks like #ChefMovie has a shot at being in box office top 10 for 6th week in a row. Thanks to all who are coming out to see it!
Thank you for joining me chatting about #ChefMovie. And thanks to @MPTF for hosting #askchef!
@JessicaMoviez @MPTF I would make it just like the El Jefe restaurant in the film. Serve the food from the movie. #askchef
@SolnSD @MPTF Jellied eels. #askchef
@MPTF Yes. Just like Swingers. #askchef
@postaudiomixer I wish! We might, however, do another #ElJefePopUp with @RidingShotgunLA soon! #askchef
@jenclymer @MPTF Through their great fundraising events. #askchef
@jenclymer @MPTF It usually ends up being about 50/50 due to schedules and availability. Always nice to work with familiar faces. #askchef
@drewyK Movies always change in production and in the edit. You are constantly rewriting /recutting. Love what this one became. #askchef
@Louis_Freddie_S Great. We just added Sir Ben Kingsley to the cast. About to begin. #askchef
@SolnSD @MPTF The one from the Muppets. #askchef
@michaelh23 @GaryClarkJr was our producer Molly Allen's idea. Love his music. He's from Austin. We got really lucky. #askchef
@pcleftovers @MPTF @JohnLeguizamo is the man. He's a great actor/improvisor/friend. I can't overstate how much I think of him. #askchef
@SolnSD @MPTF I surrender! #askchef
@MPTF Convincing real chefs that I knew what I was doing. #askchef
@Parisi2274 @MPTF Look at the name of the Boat Tours in FLA. #askchef
@jonnym2510 The Red Fort was an amazing Indian meal. I was first brought there by @edgarwright years ago while scoring Iron Man 2. #askchef
@SolnSD @MPTF For a small film @twitter can really make a difference. I think social media will only grow in importance in mktg. #askchef
@drewyK I loved making @ChefTheFilm. I would do it again in a second. Hopefully I will do more.
@jenclymer I'll drop everything if the Kogi truck passes. I'm like a kid when he hears the ice cream truck music. #askchef @kogibbq
@CallieChanel @MPTF Keep your fingers curled while chopping. Don't grab a hot pan with a wet towel. #askchef
@SolnSD @MPTF It taught me how to cook and select ingredients. To taste new foods. To redo my home kitchen like a restaurant. #askchef
@oaktreeonahill The El Jefe truck was a rental that we painted. We had to repaint it and return it after the shoot. #askchef
@SolnSD @MPTF The cornstarch trick works! And it's biodegradable. #askchef
@MPTF I worked with @RidingShotgunLA on my chef training. He sent me to culinary school and I worked in his kitchens. #askchef
@jenclymer @mptf is a wonderful organization supporting the film community. I visited the main campus with Chef. It was great #askchef
