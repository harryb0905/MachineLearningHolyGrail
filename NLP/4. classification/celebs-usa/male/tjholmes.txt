I’m so sorry.  You must be having a crappy week if THAT’S the highlight. https://t.co/AeG6aPtNuA
Ok, yes. They got the show down to 3 hours and 20 minutes. But that’s a strange way to cut it off at the end and put Julia Roberts in a position to have to say, “apparently that’s the end...” #Oscars
Wow. Green Book. If you haven’t seen it, you will absolutely be pleased with the win.  #Oscars
You know you’re the man when you can get on the #Oscars stage and say, “being up here never gets old.” Means you’ve been there a lot!!! #AlfonsoCuaron
7 Oscar nominations. 0-7 for Glenn Close.  #Oscars
Olivia Colman just gave the most delightful acceptance speech. She’s genuinely shocked by this. Awesome. #Oscars
Glenn Close. 💔 #Oscars
If anybody tells you they called it, they’re lying. Olivia Colman just pulled an upset. #Oscars
What the hell just happened?!!!?! #bestactress #Oscars
Did they tell them to skip their lines and get right to the nominees? #BestActress #Oscars
Soooooooo....about that 3 hours. #Oscars
Oh. We still have to get @repjohnlewis into the broadcast. #Oscars
#Oscars producers told me Kimmel’s open was 18 minutes. “Do the math.” https://t.co/c3lB7Rs5em
Just four categories left? Is that right? Best actor, best actress, best director &amp; best picture? Might get out in 3 hours after all!  #Oscars
The other absolute lock of the night: #Shallow #Oscars
ABC presents “Black Panther” Sunday at 8pmET. #Oscars
We’re going to all have to go back and get the transcript and then study and analyze Spike’s acceptance speech. #Oscar
This is now Spike’s #Oscars.
SPIKE!!!!!! #Oscars
Spike isn’t slowing down on his way to the stage. #Oscars
Love that Sam Jackson gave Spike an update on the Knicks. They won tonight. Now they’re only 33 1/2 games out of first place. #Oscars
Update: I’m hanging with Mahershala AND the team that just won best live action short. #Oscars
I love this live action short crew. That’s pure joy! #Oscars
Give Bradley Cooper ... something. Call it a participation Oscar or whatever. This is so impressive. #Oscars
What is it about this song?!  It’s chilling.  It puts you in an emotional trance and won’t let go. #Shallow #Oscars
Bradley Cooper is a damn hero for being able to do this. #Oscars
They didn’t even introduce them. That was some smooth s—- right there. They just casually get up from their seats in the audience. #Shallow #Oscars
You know how difficult it would be to find street parking for it in Manhattan?!? #Oscars https://t.co/wY1VyeFWFW
I’ve been glued to this broadcast so long I’ll likely go buy a Samsung S10 and a Cadillac when I get home...and not realize why. #commercials #Oscars
Is it fair to say they’ve teased “a performance by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper” before EVERY commercial break? #Oscars
“I can’t believe a film about menstration just won an Oscar!” Line of the night. #Oscars #periodendofsentence
Wayne’s World is finally getting the #Oscars attention it deserved. #BohemianRhapsody
Daaaaamn ... they cut the mic on the Spiderverse crew! That’s not a friendly neighborhood thing to do!!! 😡 #Oscars
When I first saw it, I honestly thought Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse should have gotten a #bestpicture nomination!!! #Oscars
This brother is special. Just regal. #Mahershala #Oscars
I’m hanging with Mahershala tonight. No matter what. #Oscars
Man, these #bestpicture vignettes are really really short. #Oscars
Ok, @Trevornoah is another contender for next #Oscars host.
Is there a live feed somewhere of @netflix executives that I could access? Would LOVE to see that right now. #Roma #Oscars
This show hasn’t gone long without some kind of #BlackPanther presence. A presenter or a nominee.   ($1.3 billion at the box office.) #Oscars
But IF they want to go back to a host next year, can I put in an early nomination: @melissamccarthy. #Oscars
Good Lord, @IAMJHUD. #Oscars
If that were the case, I’d have $0 in my account. https://t.co/xcUTqDqPkv
Hannah Beachler is an absolute trailblazer.  You could feel her commitment and appreciation in every word. #Oscars
This 90-second rule is right out the window. #Oscars
Black Panther is 2 for 2 so far. #costumedesign #Productiondesign #Oscars
No host, no problem so far? #Oscars
Ruth Carter makes you want to send her flowers to congratulate her. “This has been a long time coming.” #BlackPanther #Oscars
This was a category they wanted to give during the commercial break.  Awww... they cut them off. #hairmakeup #Oscars
Stay tuned for the acceptance speech for hair and makeup. #Oscars
FREE SOLO!!!!!! Congrats to Jimmy Chin. He is THE person who introduced me to climbing. That movie is amazing. #Oscars
Jason Momoa. Love this brother. He looks like he rode an actual wave to the Dolby Theater tonight. #Oscars
They knew better than to cut off REGINA KING. #oscars
Regina King is a lock. #Oscars
They hit the host controversy, “popular film” category, and politics in the first bit. Wow. #Oscars
Thanos, Deadpool, Kevin Hart, &amp; Venom all made cameos in the opening montage. 🤔 #Oscars
Wow. They all sat right back down. 😂 #Oscars
Good start.  Get right to it and get Glenn Close out of her seat.  #wewillrockyou #Oscars
They have promised to deliver a 3-HOUR show. Last year’s show was 3 hrs 53min. 🤞🏽 #Oscars
Get your stopwatches out. #Oscars is about to start.  They’ve told winners they have 90 seconds from THE MOMENT THEY HEAR THEIR NAMES CALLED to get to the stage, deliver, and finish their acceptance speeches. #ticktock

NOW: Jussie Smollett has been removed from episodes of “Empire.”  Statement from executive producers.... https://t.co/xutBOuZqLk
“Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.” — statement from #JussieSmollett attorney 🤷🏽‍♂️
CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson spoke for a lot of people in expressing anger, confusion, disappointment, disbelief.  #JussieSmollett
“Absolute justice would be an apology to the city he smeared ...” — CPD Superintendent #JussieSmollett
“It’s shameful....it took away resources we could be putting into other crimes.” — CPD Superintendent #JussieSmollett
Police say they have phone records that show #JussieSmollett talked to the brothers/“attackers” an hour or so before and after the attack and while they were on their trip to Nigeria.
Police believe #JussieSmollet actually wanted the “attack” caught on surveillance camera. But it wasn’t.
“When we learned the motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off.” — CPD Superintendent #JussieSmollet
Police says brothers/“attackers” wore gloves and punched him a little bit, but the scratches on #JussieSmollett’s face, were “likely self-inflicted.”
Commenting on how many reporters were in the room: “I wish the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention.” — Chicago Superintendent #JussieSmollett
After not holding back in his comments, the CPD Superintendent ended with, “I’m going to continue to pray for this young man.” #JussieSmollet
Motive for hoax: #JussieSmollett set up false attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary,” according to CPD Superintendent.
CPD says Jussie Smollett sent false threatening letter and “when that didn’t work, he paid $3500” to set up fake attack and “dragged Chicago’s reputation through the mud.”
CPD calls it a “publicity stunt that Chicago didn’t earn or deserve...” #JussieSmollet
Why would an African-American man use the symbolism of a noose ... and see an opportunity to promote his own public profile?” — CPD Superintendent #JussieSmollet
“Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.” — CPD Superintendent #JussieSmollett
Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson has come out STRONG against Jussie Smollett.  Says he “slapped everybody (in Chicago) in the face...to promote his own public profile.”
Chicago police are moments away from giving a press briefing on the Jussie Smollett case.
Now: Jussie Smollett is under arrest and in police custody in Chicago, according to police who made the announcement via a tweet that included this image. https://t.co/YtYMaNjvIv
NOW: Jussie Smollett has been criminally charged with a felony for filing a false police report (disorderly conduct). @AJGuglielmi
NEW (and possibly inevitable): Jussie Smollett is OFFICIALLY a suspect in his alleged attack. https://t.co/9Tto9m4zvW
A civil rights icon, a comedian, a legend, and a chef are among the names just announced to present Best Picture nominees at #TheOscars.  @repjohnlewis, @chefjoseandres, @IAMQUEENLATIFAH, @Trevornoah, @BarbraStreisand, @tmorello, @danacarvey, @amandlastenberg. https://t.co/f1DxGvmqR7
And let the twitter church say ... AMEN!  I know something in there spoke to you today. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Stop looking for the hand that brought you harm to also bring you healing. 😯#SundayService @BishopBronner
Some of life's greatest lessons are learned from hungry stomachs, empty wallets, and broken hearts. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your spirit is at its strongest when your flesh is at its weakest.  Turn your plate down, and you will re-prioritize what's important in life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When you get hungry for the wrong things in life, initiate a fast. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We don't always directly control the outcome, but you can control your attitude, mindset, and actions. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Fame comes in a moment but greatness only comes with time. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"The true worth of a man is to be measured by the objects he pursues." What are you pursuing and what does that say about you? #SundayService @BishopBronner
The older you are, the more patience you have; the less time you have on this Earth the less of a hurry you find yourself. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"After basic needs are met, the things that human beings think will bring fulfillment and contentment don't." #todaysquote #SundayService @BishopBronner
Never negotiate or make permanent decisions when you're tired, hungry, or angry. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can't live by your feelings. Be driven by your dreams, be driven by your vision. (Hell, most of us don't feel like getting out of bed in the morning!) #SundayServie @BishopBronner
Don't consult your feelings before you do something. Who cares how you feel!! #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your vision and your dreams should guide your day ... NOT your mood. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Be quick to hear, but slow to speak. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When someone is screwing up, don't just ask, "What is wrong with you?!" Instead, try this: "How can I help you make better choices?" #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't say everything that comes to your mind at the tempting moment. You can't afford to say everything. Use your filter. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Tiredness can make a coward out of courageous people.  Don't make commitments when you're tired. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your choices should reflect your dreams ... not your fears.  When you live by your fears, you live a small life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't borrow from your future to enhance your present; you should borrow from your present to enhance your future. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't sacrifice your long-term gift to satisfy a short-term appetite. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning!  There is guaranteed to be something in this #SundayService you NEED to hear today. Here we go! @BishopBronner
I will never be the man that this didn't happen to.  I am forever changed." - @JussieSmollett @GMA
Jussie Smollett says he never said his attackers were wearing a MAGA hat. "I don't need a MAGA hat as the cherry ..." @GMA
"If I had said it was a Muslim...or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.." -- @JussieSmollett @GMA
On the attack not being caught on surveillance camera: "The (surveillance) camera was facing north. How is that my issue?" -- @JussieSmollett @GMA
On doubts about his story of going out to Subway at 2am, Smollett says, "people kill me when they say things like that. Subway is open 24 hours ..." @GMA
In an exclusive interview with @RobinRoberts, @JussieSmollett says "as a gay man, you're considered somehow to be weak, and I am not weak," explaining why he didn't immediately call police. @GMA

And let the twitter church say...(a much overdue) AMEN!  Sorry, I've been away.  I know some of y'all need a little #SundayService! ;-) @BishopBronner
"Insecure leaders never develop people.  They replace them." #SundayService @BishopBronner
The litmus test for a leader is not whether they have a lot of followers ... but whether they produce other leaders. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There is purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can learn from everyone, even your enemies... even your ex.  Your ex will teach you what you don't want in your future. Some of y'all need to send a "thank you" card to your ex! 😂 #SundayService @BishopBronner
You learn from others, from your past, and from you failures. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Education is not the filling of a bucket but the lighting of a fire." #todaysquote #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you get, give.  If you learn, teach. #SundayService @BishopBronner
True leadership is often about leading yourself in a way that inspires others to follow. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't be afraid to share your talents and blessings with others.  It doesn't take away from you.  It multiplies you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sometimes you go through the fire ... to burn up your imperfections.  That fire isn't meant to punish but to purify you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
I know!  It's been a minute since I've passed along a proper #SundayService!  Sorry, ya boy has been on the road!  But I have a little something for you this morning. Here we go! @BishopBronner
Awwww.... ❤️ @GMA https://t.co/zSrG9jCrXa
Going through channels watching #SOTU coverage and one of the first comments I hear after @staceyabrams’ Democratic response is that she “speaks ably and well.” 🤦🏽‍♂️
This is pretty amazing. Herman and Joshua. To see those two men sitting next to each other all these years later. This gives you chills.  #SOTU
Is that a first?  Congress singing “happy birthday” to a guest in the gallery? Sweet. #SOTU
This adorable child. There is no way you can be hearing this story and not have a tear come to your eye. ❤️ #Grace #SOTU
I am totally enthralled in Nancy Pelosi’s role right now. #SOTU
Trump can’t help himself. Went off prompter and giving the women in Congress props. #SOTU
Well, that was a cute moment. #women #SOTU
Trump is using a good chunk of his speech (perhaps expectedly) to talk about the border. #SOTU
Matthew Charles has a great smile...and clearly, reason to be smiling. #SOTU
Trump seems to be rejecting the urge at times to go off prompter. #SOTU
Alice Johnson’s story is incredible. #SOTU
“If there is going to be peace and legislation, there can’t be war and investigation.” SOTU
That was a full eye roll. #SOTU
I can not take my eyes off Nancy Pelosi. #SOTU
Trump suggests we “reject the politics of revenge.”  He’s gonna get called out on that one. #SOTU
Trump: “Victory is not winning for our party but winning for our country.” #Sotu
Trump tells Congress he “stands here ready to work with you.” #Sotu
Trump starts with a message of unity. Ok, it was just the first two sentences, but let’s see how the rest goes. #SOTU
If you didn’t know any better, watching Trump’s intro and walk, you’d think our government was made up of only white men.  #SOTU
He actually did. #AdamwithKap? #PepsiHalftime https://t.co/yZdf467dB3

If you could ask for ONE thing ... what would it be? #SundayService @BishopBronner
You are designed to grow. Your nails grow. Your hair grows. So why shouldn't you also be growing spiritually, mentally, and emotionally? #SundayService @BishopBronner

And let the twitter church say ... Amen!  Alright, now I've got some healing to do. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every time you show your scars, you remind other hurt people that they will heal. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We often think we experience tough times because we're doing something wrong. But you experience trouble even when you're doing everything right. #SundayService @BishopBronner
What you go through is not merely about you. It is to qualify you to minister grace and comfort to other people. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Righteous people fall. When they do, they get hurt and bruised. But those scars become a message of hope and redemption to other people. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't live life alone.  You get sick in isolation. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There's something liberating about confessing your struggles, and something healing for the person hearing it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We connect with more people through our failures then we do through our successes. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sharing your scars with someone produces hope in them that they can make it out of their mess too. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The world isn't looking for someone perfect ... but for someone authentic. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't be afraid to show your wounds. Those who are designed to love you will love you regardless of your wounds. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every scar is a conversation piece, an opportunity to share your testimony. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your wounds are your testimony that lets the world know something happened in your life but you are healed from it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every saint has a past.  Every sinner has a future. #SundayService @BishopBronner
People want to see your battle scars. Your scars are proof that you survived something that happened in your life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
People want to see your wounds, where you've been hurt or broken or damaged. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Saints have a funny way of getting amnesia after coming out of their trouble, as if their past was always sanitized. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning.  This #SundayService will be right on time, as always, for some of you.  Here we go! @BishopBronner
Coop! When you get an answer (you won't), it will be one of the biggest sports stories of the year!  Twitter user has the scoop (he doesn't) no one else has and is about to reveal the teams (none) that offered Kaep a contract.  Stand by.   Let's wait.   Together. https://t.co/1N88PLV20X
Whoa! Your autocorrect is really acting up. You tried to write, “TJ, you’re right, &amp; I’m wrong.” But instead that mess came out! Colin Kaepernick has not received an offer since he hit free agency. Yes, I have a (TV) network of insiders I talk to. #NotTodayBro https://t.co/sbl7oI6qgj
I pray you’re not talking about Denver (which wanted him BEFORE he started kneeling) or talking about unsourced reports that Colin shot down or the Ravens or the Seahawks. And you say “victim” ... others say hero. Again, not today, bro. https://t.co/b3nNSumHhP
I was just on the air for 3 minutes talking about domestic abuse, and THIS is what bothered you? Not today, bro. Not today. https://t.co/xbr39E7UlQ
My pastor told me I should do this. I’ve tried and tried but can’t get past Day 1! Which day would be the biggest issue for YOU? #sleep #20DayMentalChallenge https://t.co/oCgT1SrEcx
And let the twitter church say...Amen.  OK, I have 10lbs of turkey left to eat. Holla!  #SundayService @BishopBronner
"He who covers his sins will not prosper.  But whoever confesses them will have mercy." #Proversbs28 #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can not change what you don't first evaluate. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Consider your ways. When was the last time you stopped to think about what you're doing in your life, how you're living your life?  #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't try to play it safe. Safe people never change the world.  Safe people never made a difference. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When was the last time you dreamed of something that was bigger than what you could accomplish by yourself? #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you don't own it, it can't disown it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The enemy of being exceptional ... is being ordinary.  Ordinary is your enemy. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Do you pretend to agree with everyone, apologize often, have trouble saying no, act like the people around you, avoid conflict, not admit when you're feelings are hurt? You might be a people-pleaser. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Eat, drink, and be merry!" Sounds good.  But it doesn't work. That philosophy is an enemy to your destiny. #denyyourself #SundayService @BishopBronner
Even if you have wronged no one, you will still have enemies. Someone won't like you for what you look like or where you're from or who your daddy is, etc. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning.  A short and sweet #SundayService for your this morning.  Here we go! @BishopBronner
Because people who lost everything reminded me that they still have everything that matters. Thank you and God bless Panama City. #TellTJ @GMA
Because SIX weeks after Hurricane Michael, there are still people living in tents in Panama City ....
Because I met a woman who has been given these two options for her home:  repair it and maybe you can move back into it in 9 months to a year OR tear the house down....
Because I met a couple that drove 100 miles to get a turkey dinner which sounded great given that they lost their home in the storm and they’ve been eating out of cans for weeks in a hotel room in Alabama ...
Because I met a girl whose family is scheduled to be evicted from their home ON Thanksgiving day because her mother lost work after the storm and couldn’t pay rent. Yet, this girl showed up to volunteer to serve food to others ...
I can’t even use the “I had something in my eye” excuse to explain my tears and emotion on the air this morning. But I can absolutely explain why I had such a reaction to the people of Panama City who were devastated by Hurricane Michael....

"If your habits don't line up with your dreams, then you either need to change your habits or change your dreams." #SundayService @BishopBronner
Practice gratitude. Look for something positive in each day, even though some days you have to look harder than others. #SundayService @BishopBronner
LOOK FOR THE NEW BEGINNING IN EVERY ENDING. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Areas of your focus are the areas of your reward.  But the areas of your neglect are the areas of your pain. #SundayService @BishopBronner
People won't change until the pain of remaining the same becomes greater than the pain of changing. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The first to apologize is the bravest. The first to forgive is the strongest. The first to forget is the happiest. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Be the first to apologize. Be the first to forgive. Be the first to forget.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you can't change something, then change your attitude about it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your situation won't change until YOU do. #SundayService @BishopBronner
What are you waiting for in order to change? #SundayService @BishopBronner
You'll be the same person in 10 years... except for the books you read, the people you meet, and the experiences you have.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
Life is change.  But growth is optional.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you put your money in a vending machine that says "out of order," you shouldn't expect anything to come out.  The life lesson in that: Never make an investment in something that's "out of order" and expect change. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We have access to so much information these days, so we have a lot of smart people, but we still don't seem to have a lot of wise people. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Physical training transforms the body. Education transforms the mind. Revelation transforms the spirit. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Each day there's something you can find to give thanks for, and if you look for something to complain about, you'll find that too. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Thanksgiving shouldn't just be a season.  It should be a lifestyle. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning. There's something for everyone in today's #SundayService.  It'll get your week off to a good start. Here we go!... @BishopBronner

Sheriff: Suspect is believed to have shot himself.  He was deceased when officers found him in an office adjacent to the bar. #CaliforniaShooting
Sheriff: Suspect was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. #CaliforniaShooting
Sheriff: Suspect purchased the weapon legally. #CaliforniaShooting
Sheriff: Weapon used was designed to hold 10 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber BUT it had an extended magazine. Not clear how many rounds the extended magazine held. #CaliforniaShooting
Sheriff: Police were called to suspect's home in April for a disturbance.  He was irate and acting irrationally. Mental health specialist was called.  Suspect was cleared at the time and authorities left home. #CaliforniaShooting
Sheriff: Weapon used was a Glock 21 .45 caliber handgun. #CaliforniaShooting
Sheriff: Shooter is a 28-year-old male.
Authorities are giving an update now on the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks.
This was President Trump's closing line: "I do fight back (against media) not for me but for the people of this country." #Midterms
Trump asked if he thing white supremacists and right wing terrorists are a problem: "It's a problem and it's a problem I don't like even a little bit." #Midterms
Trump is still taking questions. Asks reporters if they want him to keep going, and says "when you get bored, please tell me." #Midterms
"I come in here wanting to be a nice person, and I have people jumping out of their seats yelling at me." -- Trump #Midterms
Asked about calling himself a "nationalist" by PBS" Yamiche Alcindor, Trump chides her, "that is a racist question." #Midterms
Hmm. Trump was asked repeatedly if Putin called to congratulate him on the #midterms.  He danced around it and never answered the question.
This is unruly.  Trump telling reports to sit down ... to be quiet.  Reporters not waiting to be called on.   #Midterms
"I think you should let me run the country. You run @CNN." -- Trump to Jim Acosta of CNN. #Midterms
After Acosta refuses to give up the microphone, Trump tells him: "You're a rude, terrible person. You should not be working for @CNN. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible." #midterms
This is gotten awful and ugly.  Pres Trump is going back and forth with Jim Acosta of CNN. #Midterms
Trump says he believes "there's a very good chance" for bipartisanship but says if the Dem House hits him with subpoenas &amp; investigations, "then we're going to do the same thing and gov't would come to a halt." #Midterms
Trump: "@repmialove gave me no love ... and she lost.  Too bad.  Sorry about that, Mia." #Midterms #Utah
Trump reels off the names of Republican candidates who DIDN'T accept his support ... and lost last night. #Midterms
Trump mentions @oprah's support of GA gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. "I don't know if she likes me anymore, but that's OK. She used to." #Midterms
Trump says candidates he supported "received tremendous support" last night. #midterms
President Trump is at the White House now making comments about the midterms.
😢 @GMA #TellTJ https://t.co/FHXfhq5m2c
And let the twitter church say ... Amen! Good luck with your choices this week! #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can dwell on what went wrong or you can focus on what to do next. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't judge people for their choices when you don't understand their reasons. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't consult your emotions when making decisions.  You can't educate your emotions. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Doing the right thing doesn't always feel right. Sometimes it hurts like hell. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sometimes it feels wrong when making the right choices. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Bad decisions don't look bad at the time they're made. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can make choices but you can not choose the consequences of your choices. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Giving, honesty, optimism, happiness, forgiveness, respecting others, showing gratitude.  All choices. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Our choices determine our conduct, character, and destiny. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't have a mud fight with a pig. The pig enjoys the mudslinging too much, and both of you will end up dirty. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Wisdom is simply knowing what to ignore. Certain things don't deserve a moment of your attention. #SundayService @BishopBronner
How you choose to treat people is not a reflection of how they are but how YOU are. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them." #SundayService @BishopBronner #todaysquote
Love is not an emotion. It is a decision. You choose love. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can't mandate love. Love has to be by choice. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"One's philosophy is not best expressed in words; it is expressed in the choices one makes and the choices we make are ultimately our responsibility." #SundayService @BishopBronner
Always do your best to make the right choices, and always do your best to learn from the wrong ones. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Life is so incredibly short. But between your birth date and your death date is a dash. (8/19/77-___) The #powerofchoice determines what we do with that dash. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There is nothing like the power of NOW. Tomorrow is an illusion. #SundayService @BishopBronner
RIGHT NOW is the only time you have to change your future. Tomorrow is too late. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning. Some of us really need to hear today's #SundayService. It's about the #PowerofChoice. Here we go! @BishopBronner

And let the twitter church say...Amen. Short and sweet #SundayService this morning, but hope something spoke to you. @BishopBronner
Even if you're deemed unattractive by 99% of the world population, there's still 75 million people left in the world who think you're absolutely gorgeous. #persevere #SundayService @BishopBronner
Just because you're favored doesn't mean you're exempt from hardship. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The WAIT of your dream is determined by the WEIGHT of your dream. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Seeking is a process.  It takes perseverance.  You don't just knock on a door once, do you? #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Almost" is the saddest word in the world. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It's the saddest thing to find people who almost made it but didn't realize how close they were when they decided to quit. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't pray to be exempt from what you were designed to endure. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Pain that is not transformed is transmitted....to your family, to your children, to you relationships. Confront your pain. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Stop running from what hurts you. There's growth in that pain. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Harvest always takes time. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sometimes you won't even realize that things are happening in your life because they're happening so gradually. That's just the enemy/devil trying to discourage you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Some of the greatest things in life do not happen immediately. The process of life is to happen gradually...and then suddenly. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't be discouraged when things happen slowly. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Growth demands a new environment. The place you are will start to feel uncomfortable if you're growing and the people around you aren't. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning.  How about a little encouragement this morning?  Have a good #SundayService that could start your week off right. Here we go! @BishopBronner

Ford/Bentley. Timex/Rolex. Android/iPhone. First class/coach. Those differences are about a standard of living, not a standard of life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Doesn't matter if it's a Timex or Rolex, they tell the same time.  Doesn't matter if it's first class or coach, you're flying to same destination. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Doesn't matter if you're in a Ford or Bentley. You're still on the same road. Doesn't matter if it's an Android or iPhone. You're texting the same folks. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We've confused a standard of living with a standard of life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Quit stumbling over what's behind you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It takes courage on a daily basis to find something positive and meaningful about our life and ourselves. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Life has detours, delays and disappointments, but the destination is more important than the route. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The speed and distance of your life are impacted by your travel companions. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Why pick up a bystander when their destination is not in the same direction as yours? #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your destiny will take you only certain distances with certain people. But at some point, your destiny causes you to get off on your own stop. #sundayService @BishopBronner
Don't bring friends along your life journey that don't have your same itinerary. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Life is designed to be LIVED, not endured. #SundaySevice @BishopBronner
A lot of people live life in "dinner cruise mode":  Get on board, there's no real destination, they enjoy music, dinner, dancing, and drinking... then the ship drops them off at the exact same place they left. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't just walk away from something without understanding what you just left. Reflection turns experience into insight. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your history is connected to destiny. Whatever it was that caused you pain is also going to bring you power. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't leave any situation without the blessing.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
You have to understand your history. There are clues in your history that tell you who you are and what you're supposed to be doing. #SundayService @BishopBronner

"I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh." -- Sen Collins closes with those words and walks off. #KavanaughVote
Sen Collins says the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh do not meet the "more likely than not" standard. #KavanaughVote
NOW: "I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court." -- Sen. Collins #KavanaughVote
Sen Collins is now making the case against Dr. Ford and her allegations. #KavanaughVote
Sen Collins says she found Dr. Ford's testimony to be "sincere, painful, and compelling. I believe she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma upended her life." #KavanaughVote
Sen Collins is talking about gang rape on the floor of the US Senate. Called allegation "outlandish." #KavanaughVote
"We'll be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be." -- Sen Collins #KavanaughVote
Sen. Collins is now addressing the sexual assault allegations: "The confirmation process now involves evaluating whether Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee." #KavanaughVote
Sen. Collins is making a STRONG defense of Judge Kavanaugh but none of it, so far, has anything to do with the sexual assault allegations against him. #KavanaughVote
She is citing legal cases, Kavanaugh's career, etc. She is talking to Kavanaugh opponents who are worried about how he'd rule in some cases. Pointing out why they shouldn't worry. #KavanaughVote
Unless she makes a major pivot at some point, Sen. Collins seems to be making a case for Judge Kavanaugh. #KavanaughVote
"I've never considered the president's identity or party when evaluating Supreme Court nominations." -- Sen. Collins #KavanaughVote
Sen. Collins says she hopes the confirmation process has "hit rock bottom" because it's been in "steady decline for more than 30 years." #KavanaughVote
"Today, we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional.." -- Sen. Collins #KavanaughVote
Switching to another big story happening now. Sen. Susan Collins has taken to the Senate floor to announce her vote on #Kavanaugh.
Jason Van Dyke was facing 20 years to life if convicted of 1st degree murder. He now faces anywhere from probation up to 20 years for a 2nd degree murder conviction. #LaquanMcDonald
Jury convicts Jason Van Dyke of lesser 2nd degree murder rather than 1st degree which is what he was charged with. #LaquanMcDonald
"We the jury find the defendant Jason Van Dyke guilty of aggravated battery with a firearm 1st shot." "We the jury find the defendant Jason Van Dyke guilty of aggravated battery with a firearm 2nd shot." Goes on like that until she gets to "16th shot." #LaquanMcDonald
Jury foreperson has to read verdict on each of the shots fired. #LaquanMcDonald
NOW: Jason Van Dyke has been found guilty of 2ND DEGREE MURDER in the killing of #LaquanMcDonald.
Jason Van Dyke is facing 1st degree murder charge and 16 counts of aggravated battery (one for each shot fired at #LaquanMcDonald).
NOW: Jury is coming into the courtroom now to deliver verdict in Jason Van Dyke trial. #LaquanMcDonald
Judge tells gallery that if you can't hear the verdict without an emotional outburst, please leave now. One woman apparently walks out. #LaquanMcDonald
Court is in session. Judge issues warning about outbursts after verdict: "you will be arrested immediately." #LaquanMcDonald
From Chicago PD as we await verdict in Jason Van Dyke trial: "...thousands of #ChicagoPolice officers are at the ready to safeguard neighborhoods and defend the rights of peaceful demonstrations." #LaquanMcDonald
Verdict to be read at 2:45ET in the trial of Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke.  He's facing murder charge for shooting black teen #LaquanMcDonald 16 times.
NOW: 51-49. Kavanaugh is moving forward. #KavanaughVote
NOW: Sen. Lisa Murkowski has voted NO on moving the Kavanaugh nomination forward.
NOW: Procedural vote on Brett Kavanaugh is taking place now. Senators voting whether to move Kavanaugh nomination ahead to a final vote.
Lord have mercy.  On the walk to school listening to my 5 year old talk about the “lockdown” drills they did ... “in case a stranger comes in the school that wants to hurt us.” Oh, my #BabySabine. #safeplaces
"The most dangerous part of their day is crossing the street and go to Starbucks." Defense attorney mocks prosecutors in pointing out the difficulty of being a police officer. #LaquanMcDonald #closingarguments
Defense attorney: "Don't believe their (prosecutors) fake tears about #LaquanMcDonald."  #closingarguments
Defense attorney: "this could have been prevented with one simple step ... had #LaquanMcDonald dropped that knife, he'd be here today." #closingarguments
Defense has started its #closingarguments in the murder trial of Jason Van Dyke. #LaquanMcDonald
"He looked at #LaquanMcDonald for 6 seconds before he made the irrevocable decision to shoot him not once, but 16 times." -- Prosecutor #closingarguments
Difficult to hear. "Each bullet is a crime...each caused blood loss...(Laquan McDonald) was alive each time (Ofc. Jason Van Dyke) shot him...each shot robbed him of a chance of survival."
Closing arguments are underway in the murder trial of Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke who shot #LaquanMcDonald 16 times.  Prosecutor is giving closing.
#todaysquote https://t.co/UAdfueJadw
The WH press briefing in brief:  "The president talked about the unfairness of young men being presumed guilty  instead of innocent ... so what about the Central Park Five?" ✊🏾 @ayesharascoe
Prosecutor: "You stopped shooting because your gun was empty?" Van Dyke: "yes."  #LaquanMcDonald
Prosecutor asks Van Dyke if he even had to get out of the squad car that night, and he responds, "you can also say I didn't have to go to work that night." #LaquanMcDonald
Van Dyke claims #LaquanMcDonald was wielding a knife and had "bugged out eyes" when he shot him.
Van Dyke tells prosecutor he can't remember some details immediately after shooting #LaquanMcDonald because he was "under a lot of stress after the shooting."
NOW: Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke is on the stand testifying in his own defense. He's charged with murder for shooting 17 year old LaQuan McDonald 16 times.
OK, maybe ... just maybe, I’m starting to like this thing. #beardbegone 📷 by @misanharriman @whatweseee https://t.co/PMPwkl4hRK

Classic from Pres. Trump: "It's one of my only good traits. I've never had alcohol. Can you imagine if I had?! What a mess I'd be! I'd be the world's worst." #Kavanaugh
On Dianne Feinstein, Trump says she "probably" leaked Dr. Ford's name and story. He thinks that "based on her very bad body language the other day." #Kavanaugh
On Corey Booker, Trump says, "he ran Newark, NJ into the ground." #Kavanaugh
Trump is going ... full Trump right now in the Rose Garden.  Going after Judiciary Committee Democrats by name. "For 15 years, he (Blumenthal) said he was a war hero... and he's up there saying we need honest and integrity." #Kavanaugh
Responding about Kavanaugh's high school drinking, Trump says he knows a Democratic senator, "one who's pretty aggressive. I've seen that person in very bad situations...somewhat compromising."
President Trump is taking from the Rose Garden.  Most questions are about #Kavanaugh and the FBI investigation.
JANET JACKSON https://t.co/gc9CVeNmYu
Asked if he's thought about a replacement for Kavanaugh, Trump doesn't hesitate: "not even a little bit." #KavanaughVote
Trump calls Dr. Ford's testimony "compelling."  Says she's a "very fine woman." #KavanaughVote
Reaction from President Trump to what's happened in the Judiciary Committee. "I will be totally reliant on what Sen. Grassley and the committee decides to do." #KavanaughVote
"I think we can have a short pause and make sure the FBI can investigate...It would be short and limited in scope to the current allegations." -- Sen. Jeff Flake #KavanaughVote
This is unreal. Sen. Grassley abruptly ends the hearing, based on the "2-hour rule." You hear Feinstein immediately exclaim, "what?!" #KavanaughVote
It seems ... Sen. Flake, the deciding vote on the committee, is not comfortable with a floor vote on Kavanaugh until the FBI further investigates sexual assault accusations. #KavanaughVote
They are still trying to clarify exactly what's going to happen moving forward. #KavanaughVote
This is his post-#KavanaughVote face. https://t.co/nyyUb66yy2
Senator Flake says he's only voting to advance Kavanaugh with the understanding that they will allow an investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh. #KavanaughVote
Chaos and confusion has erupted again.  #KavanaughVote
NOW: Sen. Flake is calling for a delay of the FLOOR VOTE for up to a week. #KavanaughVote
Sen. Grassley is giving Senator Flake the floor. #KavanaughVote
Sen. Grassley has started the meeting.  Says they are going to "take action." Democrats are coming back to their seats. #KavanaughVote
A few Democrats filed into the room.  With them, Sen. Jeff Flake.  Then, they all turned around and walked right back out. #KavanaughVote
Strange scene in the committee room. Only two senators (Grassley and Hatch) are in their seats. Both look annoyed. #KavanaughVote
The #KavanaughVote that was supposed to take place at 1:30pm ET is obviously delayed.  All Democrats are out of the committee room. Only a couple of Republicans are in their seats.
Democratic Sens. Blumenthal, Harris, &amp; Hirono walked out of ongoing hearing. They're now holding a press conference outside. #KavanaughHearings
"The Republican strategy is not ATTACK the victim.  It's IGNORE the victim." -- Sen. Feinstein #KavanaughHearings
Sen. Feinstein says the person yesterday who "showed a balanced temperament was Dr. Ford." #KavanaughHearings
Grassley has scheduled a vote for 1:30pm this afternoon. #KavanaughHearings
Several Democrats have walked out of the committee hearing while Chairman Grassley is speaking. #KavanaughHearings
"I do not recall the events" described by Dr. Ford. -- Mark Judge in new letter to committee #KavanaughHearings
In letter to committee last night, Mark Judge says he avoids public speaking because of issues dealing with alcoholism, depresssion, etc. #KavanaughHearings
Committee has again gone into chaos. Democrats refusing to participate in vote. Sens. Booker and Harris refuse to participate and vote. #KavanaughHearings
Sen. Grassley just read a letter he says the committee received last night from Mark Judge. #kavanaughHearings
"We can not in good conscious vote without at least hearing from Mark Judge." -- Sen. Blumenthal #KavanaughHearings
Sen. Blumenthal asks to put forward a motion to subpoena Mark Judge. #KavanaughHearings
Senate Judiciary Committee meeting is underway. Chairman asks minority if they have any motions that he'll consider. #KavanaughHearings
The way he just spoke to Senator Amy Klobuchar..... #KavanaughHearings
He needs to ask for a recess to compose himself. #KavanaughHearings
A Supreme Court nominee is describing drinking games he played in high school. #KavanaughHearings
Coming off the rails a little bit. #KavanaughHearings
Oh my god. #KavanaughHearings
Kavanaugh is angry. Defensive. He’s possibly chipping away at any earlier sympathy peoole might have had in seeing him in tears. #KavanaughHearings
“I liked beer. I still like beer.”  #todaysquote ... from a Supreme Court Nominee’s confirmation hearing. #KavanaughHearings
Judge Kavanaugh chokes up and needs to pause when talking about his daughter telling him, “we should pray for the woman.” #KavanaughHearings
“You may defeat me in the final vote. But you’ll never get me to quit. Ever.” — Kavanaugh #KavanaughHearings
“You’ve replaced ‘advise and consent with search and destroy.’” Judge Kavanaugh has come out with a passionate, emphatic, forceful defense in his opening statement. #KavanaughHearings
“Judge Kavanaugh, Dr. Ford says she’s 100% certain it was you that assaulted her. Can you say you’re 100% certain it was not you?” — Sen. T. J. Holmes  #KavanaughHearings
Sen. Durbin asks directly: “With what degree of certainty do believe it was Judge Kavanaugh that assaulted you?” Dr. Ford doesn’t hesitate: “100%.” #KavanaughHearings
“Uproarious laughter” between Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge is the standout memory from the assault. — Dr. Ford #KavanaughHearings
“No, it is not” possible to have mixed up Brett Kavanaugh with anyone else. — Dr. Ford #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford says she insisted on a 2nd front door at her current home because of fear and claustrophobia related to sexual assault. #KavanaughHearings
Questioning by prosecutor is now beginnng. #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford finished her opening statement and again asked for caffeine. They finally got her coffee. #KavanaughHearings
“My responsibility is to tell you the truth.”  — Dr. Ford #KavanaughHearings
Her voice has been shaking and cracking the entire time she’s been speaking. Says she’s received “constant harassment” since her name because public. Has moved out of her home. Has needed security guards.  #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford says she wanted to move in because Brett Kavanaugh “didn’t rape her.” #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford says she didn’t tell her parents about the assault because she didn’t want them to know she was at a house with boys and drinking beer. #KavanaughHearings
Don’t know how Kavanaugh survives this. Dr. Ford is giving testimony that’s painful to hear and giving specifics: they locked the door, turned up music, made eye contact with Mark Judge, etc. #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford says she can’t remember all the details surrounding party in 1982, but the details of the assault “I will never forget.” #KavanaughHearings
“... This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me.” — Dr. Ford #KavanaughHearings
“I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified.” — Dr. Ford #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Ford begins: “after my opening, I anticipate needing some caffeine.” #KavanaughHearings
THIS. “This is not a trial for Dr. Ford. This is a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh.” — Feinstein #KavanaughHearings
Feinstein details allegations from Swetnick and Ramirez and says FBI should investigate both. #KavanaughHearings
Sen. Feinstein, the ranking member, begins her opening statement by acknowledging Dr. Ford, her background, her accomplishments. Points out the challenges women face with sexual violence. #KavanaughHearings
Grassley says they’ve made 8 requests for evidence to Deborah Ramirez. 6 requests to Julie Swetnick. Says all have been refused. #KavanaughHearings
Grassley says attorneys for other 2 #Kavanaugh accusers have refused to provide any corroborating evidence or make their clients available. #Kavanaugh
Grassley is quoting Sen. Biden during Clarence Thomas confirmation to support the idea that an FBI investigation is unwarranted. #KavanaughHearings
Grassley in his opening suggests that this could have been investigated earlier. Blames Democrats for us being where we are today. #KavanaughHearings
Sen. Grassley apologizes to both Dr. Ford and Kavanaugh for how they’ve been treated and what they’ve endured the past few weeks. #KavanaughHearings
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has taken her seat in front of the Senate Judicairy Committee. #KavanaughHearings

President Trump has stepped to the mic in New York for a solo press conference.
"I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr Ford. I am not questioning that Dr Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone." -- Kavanaugh prepared testimony
"In retrospect, I said &amp; did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that’s not why we are here...What I’ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr Ford describes." -- Kavanaugh prepared testimony
"I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many." -- Brett Kavanaugh prepared testimony at tomorrow's hearing.

Anita Hill tells @GStephanopoulos the senators either don't take the allegations seriously or they just want to get the process over with. "I'm not sure which is at play." @GMA #KavanaughHearings
Anita Hill: "the hearing questions need to have a frame and an (FBI) investigation is the best frame." @GMA #KavanaughHearings

The prize check is $3.8 million. My #BabySabine is getting into tennis starting Monday. #USOpen
This young lady just won the #USOpen..but tells the pro-Serena crowd, “I’m sorry it had to end like this.” I’m in tears over a trophy ceremony. #USOpen
Serena Williams is MY FAVORITE ATHLETE OF ALL F—-ING TIME. #USOpen
Classy. Serena near tears as she refuses to take questions and instead gives props to Naomi Osaka. #USOpen
Poor thing. Osaka doesn’t look happy or excited on the stand. She just won the #USOpen.
I have never anticipated a trophy ceremony as much as this one. #USOpen
Serena’s coach admitted he was coach ... “like every coach.” But this is the first time he’s ever been called for a coaching violation. #USOpen
Too bad for Naomi Osaka. She’s ABSOLUTELY a deserving champion. Controversy is going to take away from her accomplishment. But it shouldn’t.   #USOpen
I hate tennis. #USOpen
Serena just blanked her opponent in the next game, btw. #USOpen
I hope Serena goes Thanos on this place. #USOpen
I’m headed to Flushing. #USOpen
I have NEVER seen a penalty that cost someone a game. #USOpen
She called the umpire a “thief” for taking an earlier point away. So he docked her a GAME. A GAME penalty. #USOpen
Serena is now near tears trying to plead her case to officials. This is a shame. #USOpen
Chair ump just penalized Serena a GAME. Confusion ensues. #USOpen
Serena is HOT!  ... over the insinuation that she’s been cheating via coaching from the stands. Just went off on the chair umpire. #USOpen
Serena just broke a racket. I just broke a cocktail glass. That tells you how things are going. #USOpen
Wow!!!! “I don’t cheat to win. I’d rather lose.” Serena tells that to the chair umpire after suggestion that she was getting some coaching from the stands. #USOpen
Serena is down a set in the #USIpen final. Therefore .... https://t.co/5YbrmhVyMa
Tennis sucks. #USOpen #Serena
Did I just see Pierce Brosnan and Vanessa Williams next to each other at the #USOpen?
5-1. Serena is down 5-1 in the first set. I hate tennis. #USOpen
Ok. This isn’t funny anymore. #USOpen #Serena
I can’t stand how much I love Naomi Osaka. I want to fiercely root against her... because she’s up against @serenawilliams. But she’s just ... wonderful.  #USOpen
These are big screen only events!!!! https://t.co/KOfaZXDFDM
Besides @ArkRazorbacks athletics, I stress out watching @serenawilliams more than anything else in sports. #USOpen
Just about the only reason I would turn away from a college football Saturday: @serenawilliams. #USOpen

WOW! “Diana Ross lived 4 doors down the street. The Four Tops lived two blocks over. The Temptations lived 3 blocks over. There were a lot of us in that neighborhood.” - Smokey Robinson talking about growing up in Detroit w/Aretha. https://t.co/hSHA77UFo4

"We value diversity not just at the White House but throughout the administration. We will continue to try to diversify the staff." -- @PressSec
Sarah Sanders asked specifically "how many African American staffers are in this building (White House)?" Sanders: "I'm not going to go through and do a count." #WHBriefing
"The president has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information." -- @PressSec #WHBriefing
Trump: Brennan has "leveraged his status to make ... unfounded and outrageous accusations about the administration." #WHBriefing
"Erratic conduct and behavior" are cited as part of the reason for taking away Brennan's security clearance. #WHBriefing
Sarah Sanders starts the #WHBriefing by reading a statement from Pres. Trump: he is taking away former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance.

This was Tiger’s lowest final round score (64) at a major in his career. Wow. #PGAChampionship
Tiger on scoring birdies today: “This golf course was giving it up.” #PGAChampionship
I can’t wait to see the ratings for the final round of the #PGAChampionship. #Tiger
Wait a second. Wait. What was that?! Rather, WHO was that? #Tiger #PGAChampionship
Why is he toying with our emotions like this?! Birdies the last hole. I guess....there’s still a chance. #PGAChampionship #Tiger
This was almost the greatest week ever: Tiger wins a major AND @idriselba is James Bond. Oh well, 1 out of 2 ain’t bad. (They BETTER confirm Idris now.) #PGAChampionship

Damn. DAMN. DAMN!!!!!! #Tiger #PGAChampionship

He’s 1 shot back! Tiger is flat out ballin’ today. This might be the only time an @ABC/@GMA employee ever utters this: everybody turn to @CBS. #PGAChampionship
Tied for 2nd! Two shots back from the lead!  6 holes to play. This is really happening. #Tiger #PGAChampionship

And let the twitter church say ... AMEN!  I hope you got something out of today's #SundayService.  Now, go out there .. and watch your mouth!! 😉 @BishopBronner
Things that make you happy never last. What we're really looking for is peace. #Sundayservice @BishopBronner
We think we're looking for happiness, but w're really just looking for peace. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When you have peace, despite the negativity in your life ... you should still sleep like a baby. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Words ...  -- Release healing or create wounds -- Inspire confidence or fear -- Convince or deceive -- Inspire or discourage -- Bless or curse -- Affirm or discredit #SundayService @BishopBronner
To influence your output, control your input. Fill yourself with good things. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you want to keep your peace, try holding your tongue. #MouthPeace #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sometimes we're hurt most by words never heard: -- I'm sorry -- I was wrong -- I'm proud of you -- I appreciate you -- I forgive you -- You matter -- I love you #SundayService @BishopBronner
Words can hit harder than a fist. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Those who control their tongue will have a long life. Opening your mouth can ruin everything." (That's actually in the Bible.) #SundayService @BishopBronner
Never pass up an opportunity to say something good about a person behind their back. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Is your mouth a blowtorch or a water fountain?  We should refreshing people with what comes out of our mouths, not burning them down. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Before you speak, put it through the think test:  -- Is it true? -- Is it helpful? -- Is it inspiring? -- Is it necessary? -- Is it kind? #SundayService @BishopBronner
Waiting means 1) staying active and 2) staying faithful until doors open or new opportunities arrive. Waiting is not passive. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Life is a waiting game. You can't have everything you want when you want it. You have to wait. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your mouth can cause you trouble and ruin your relationships. It can cause strife ... all because you can't keep your mouth shut. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Watch your tongue and keep your mouth shut, and you will stay out of trouble." #Proverbs21 #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: How can you use your mouth this week to produce peace in your environment (at work, at home, with relatives, etc.)? #MouthPeace #SundayService @BishopBronner
Wisdom is simply knowing what to ignore. #MouthPeace #SundayService @BishopBronner
You don't have to respond every time someone says something stupid to you. #MouthPeace #SundayService @BishopBronner
A great deal of having peace in your life is knowing how to hold your tongue. #MouthPeace #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your words are like a dagger that pierce another person. An apology might pull the dagger out, but the hole/wound is still there. #SundayService @BishopBronner
How many times has your mouth gotten you in trouble? #MouthPeace #SundayService @BishopBronner
How aggravating when someone says the wrong thing at the wrong time, but the right word spoken at the right time to the right person can be prophetic. #SundayService @BishopBronner

The president wasn't asked during the presser about Michael Cohen or Robert Mueller. Reporters shouted those questions as Trump walked away. He didn't respond.
Trump says he always leaves room for negotiation, but "I would certainly be willing to consider a shutdown if we don't get proper border security."
First question goes to Daily Caller.  Asks if the president is willing to shut down gov't in September if he doesn't get $25 billion for border wall and if he's leaving room for negotiation.
"It's time we had proper border security.  We are the laughing stock of the world." -- Trump
"I have no problem doing a (gov't) shutdown" if we don't get border security -- Trump.
On illegal immigration: "Italy got tired of it. They didn't want it any longer."  Goes on to praise the Italian PM.
"Border security is national security. They are one and the same." -- Trump
President Trump is holding a press conference with Italian PM right now.  Expected to take questions from media (except CNN).
Prosecutor: By fleeing, refusing to obey commands, taking gun out of his pocket, "...Mr. Blevins represented a danger to the lives" of the officers. #ThurmanBlevins

And let the twitter church say ... Amen!  Y'all better go spark a fire in somebody today! #SundayService @BishopBronner
Light as many fires as you can in people you come in contact with. Somebody needs your light. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: Are there areas in your life where your fire has gone out? #SundayService @BishopBronner
Write you vision down, and it should make you want to get up and run. Write it, read it, run with it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't wait for something major. Celebrate the small victories. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Discouragement is the exhaustion of the human soul. #SundayService @BishopBronner
3 workers are asked what they're doing. First says, "I'm laying bricks." 2nd says, "I'm building a wall." 3rd says, "I'm building a cathedral." Are you laying bricks or building a cathedral? See the big picture. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Busyness will kill your fire.  We should long to hear, "well done" ... not "much done." #SunhdayService @BishopBronner

Things that will kill your fire:  -- Fear -- Pride  -- Boredom -- Disappointment  -- Busyness  -- Materialism -- Exhaustion #SundayService @BishopBronner
Often you're positioned not according to preference but according to purpose. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you meet somebody, and every time you get around them, you start to feel down ... RUN! #SundayService @BishopBronner
Get in a relationship with someone who isn't so narcissistic.  They'll always be too busy trying to fan their own flames to fan yours. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: Who lights your fire and fans your flame?  You have to keep those people close to you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
People who have given up on their dreams will always try to talk you out of yours. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The moment you get your fire going there are people that will come and try to put it out. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You often feel tired NOT because you've done too much, but because you've done too little of what sparks a fire in you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every thought, every idea is a spark. Fan it into a flame. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Right now, you might only have a spark. But you need to fan it into a flame. #sundayService @BishopBronner
Some people won't change until they feel the heat.  By then, things have gone too far. Change when you see the light.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
You ought to change your life NOT because you feel the heat but because you see the light. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You need people around you who know how to fan your flame. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We are keepers of the flame.  But we allow too many flames in people to go out by our lack of encouragement. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Instead of catching people doing something wrong, catch them doing something right and celebrate it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We're so quick to voice criticism but not positivity.  Don't just think it, voice it when you have something positive to say about someone. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't ever have a positive thought about a person.... and fail to share it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning.  It was all about #flames in today's #SundayService!  Has yours gone out?  Here we go! @BishopBronner

Fair question. His entire career he's worn red in the final round of tournaments. (His mom said it's his power color.) So, if he's in a red shirt AND he has the lead in a major, it's something we haven't seen in many years. https://t.co/7L1KJ2lBcg

The moment you're ready to quit is usually right before the moment your miracle will happen. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The faith to step out is worthless without the faithfulness to stick it out. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Even if you're doing the same things, learn how to do it better and faster. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It's a curse to remain in the place where you are. Too many are living in a cursed situation and don't even realize it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When people need help, they don't want somebody with potential. They want somebody who's ready right now. #SundayService @BishopBronner
BE READY. You have to be ready and looking with expectancy.  Everyday you should be saying, "Is THIS my day?" #SundayService @BishopBronner
Dream big, but don't be afraid to start small. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Sometimes when you ask for a miracle, you get instructions. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Dissatisfaction is a precursor to change. Not until you get fed up with the way your life has been will you step out and change. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Do you have more trust in somebody else providing for you ... than you have in yourself to step out and provide for others? #SundayService @BishopBronner
Folks miss out on opportunity...because they are in love with security. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you don't step forward, you will always be in the same place. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you don't ask, the answer will always be no. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you don't go after what you want, you will never have it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Get out of the ordinary and the mundane.  Get out of the boat and walk out onto the supernatural. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morn.  I guarantee every single one of you will hear something in today's #SundayService that applies to you RIGHT NOW. Here we go! @BishopBronner

Sanders: "He (Trump) was saying 'no' to answering more questions" not saying 'no' to whether Russia is still targeting the United States. #WHBriefing
White House briefing is underway. Sara Sanders had to issue another clarification to an earlier Trump comment. He said "no" today when asked if he believes Russia is still targeting the US.
Would vs Wouldn't. Trump says he misspoke in Helsinki. He said: "I don't see any reason why it WOULD be Russia." He says he meant: "I don't see any reason why it WOULDN'T be Russia."
Trump acknowledges Russian meddling but says Russia had "no impact on the outcome of the election."
Trump says he has "full faith in our intelligence agencies." The EXACT moment he said this, the room went dark. Lights went out.
About his trip, Trump says, "The press covered it quite inaccurately."
"Getting along is a positive thing... Diplomacy and engagement is better than hostility and conflict." -- Trump
"We have never been in a worse relationship with Russia than we had a few days ago." -- Trump
Trump calls trip a success but says, "Our most successful visit" was in Helsinki with Putin.
"There's a great spirit that we (NATO) didn't have before." -- Trump
"I have helped the NATO allowance greatly" by increasing contributions from other allies. -- Trump
Trump comments about his European trip being played now.
Trump: "Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing." #TrumpPutinSummit
Trump begins by congratulating Putin a great World Cup. "In the United States, we call it soccer. I watched quite a bit of it. It was beautifully done." #TrumpPutinSummit
Trump and Putin are addressing the media now ahead of their one-on-one summit.
Remember what I said about tennis yesterday?  That applies to soccer today. #WorldCupFinal

Don’t be afraid to tackle tough problems. You can not change what you are unwilling to engage. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Divine promises are put in your reach, not necessarily in your hand. #SundayService @BishopBronner
People accept the fruit of compromise because they can’t see the rewards of perseverance. #SundayService @BishopBronner

What rock (problem) needs to be broken to pieces in your life? #HammerTime #SundayService @BishopBronner
There are people attached to you right now that are working against your destiny and hindering you from being who and what you need to be. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Ask: What would I do if money were no object, and I knew I could not fail? @SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't be a know-it-all.  Be a learn-it-all. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: Why am I here? Until you know why you're here, you'll misbehave and underperform. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: Who am I?  YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU DO. YOU CAN QUIT WHAT YOU DO BUT YOU CAN'T QUIT WHO YOU ARE. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If your vision won't fit on the front of a t-shirt, it's too complicated. #SundayService @BishopBronner
A thought that goes unspoken will die unborn, but the moment you speak it, you give life to it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Do not give voice to every crazy thought that comes to your mind. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: How well are you able to rest your tongue from speaking what shouldn't be said? #SundayService @BishopBronner
The real art of conversation is not to say the right thing at the right time...but to avoid saying the wrong thing at the tempting moment. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: How is your humility when you have a whole lot? #SundayService @BishopBronner #ThePowerofaQuestion
Two things define you:  1) Your patience when you have nothing, and 2) your attitude when you have everything. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If a person's reaction was greater than your original action, then the reaction was about something else. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Good morning! #SundayService is back and @BishopBronner has me reevaluating my whole life with #ThePowerofaQuestion. Whoa. Here we go!

Alleged shooter had a grudge against #CapitalGazette. Former editor once told a friend, "this is a guy who is going to come in and shoot us." @GMA @PierreTABC
"He (shooter) did not look like somebody who was out of control. He looked like somebody who was comfortable with what he was doing." -- witness to #CapitalGazette shooting tells @GMA.
Police say officers were on the scene withing 90 seconds of the shooting and engaged the shooter.  #CapitalGazette
After declining to reveal how many had been killed for the entire press briefing, the last statement made by police at the briefing was that 5 were killed. #CapitalGazette
NOW: 5 killed, according to police. #CapitalGazette
Shooter is in custody and is being questioned, according to county officials.  #CapitalGazette
County executive doesn't say how many have been killed.  Only that "several people have died" at shooting at Capital Gazette newspaper office in Annapolis.
Officials giving update on shooting at Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, MD. "There are several people who have died from this incident."
Yep, that's me on the right.  35+ years ago, at my dear aunt Linda Kay's wedding, I had the honor of being the ring bearer.  I was pallbearer at her funeral...this weekend.  Ain't life… https://t.co/HVSFxs6pzN

Y'all ... LeBron checking out of this game. The ovation this crowd gave him, know this could be it.  Im even a little emotional. #NBAFinals
Follow up text from my boy: "This is the 1st NBA series that was won in 3 games. This game is an exhibition game." Damn, bruh. #NBAFinals
Larry Nance, Jr is taking jumpers. Oh my word. #NBAFinals
Just got this text from my boy: "if this game was a fight, they would stop it..." #NBAFinals
Uh oh. #NBAFinals
Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shot! Shot! Shots! #halftime @LilJon #NBAFinals
I admit...I'm an Atlanta guy, so this @LilJon and @Ludacris halftime show is the highlight of the #NBAFinals for me. #turndownforwhat #yeah
Steph had 11 points in Game 3. He's got 12 points in the first 6 minutes of this one. #NBAFinals
They've taken up this mantra tonight here at the Q: #Cavsin7. #NBAFinals
Give a hug, a smile, a kind word, a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear, and sometimes, just give somebody a break...because every one of us is going through something.
We tried to steal @HUMONGOTRON...but triggered the alarm. #OceansGMA #NBAFinals @GMA https://t.co/fYYP06ZyLm
This is what happens on an off day at the #NBAFinals. (There was more but this is the only pic I could share.) @JalenRose @GMA @christuckerreal https://t.co/dfysJnerPZ
People/Cavs fans are heading to the  exits here at the Q. #NBAFinals
Uh oh. #NBAFinals
There is some nervous energy in this building right now. You can feel it. #NBAFinals @TheQArena
Rodney Hood, MVP. Too soon? #NBAFinals
Set an #NBAFinals record for 3 pointers in Game 2. Tonight, Steph is 0-8 from the 3-point line. #NBAFinals
Out of a possible 36 minutes, LeBron played 34:52 in the first 3 quarters. Dude has been a machine in the #NBAFinals and the playoffs.  #respect
These two teams put on a great show. Make me want to see #CavsWarriorsV. #NBAFinals
Red Panda just showed how to make a comeback.  Feel off her unicycle to start ... got back up and was flawless after that. #NBAFinals #halftimeshow
I’ve never been so glued to a Red Panda performance. #NBAFinals https://t.co/Dj7JIEAMyx
More importantly... Red Panda just fell off her unicycle at the beginning of her halftime show. 😳 #NBAFinals
Steph has more fouls than points. And it’s only a 6 point game. #NBAFinals
What was that on the overturned foul?  Did the refs just say to LeBron: “ok, we owe you one.” #NBAFinals
I have no rooting interest. Don’t care who wins the #NBAFinals. But it warms my heart to see the ball go in the basket for JR Smith right now.
How in the world are the Warriors only down by one... #NBAFinals
Cavs fans already getting onto the referees and the game hasn't even started. Booed loudly when image of tonight's refs was put on Jumbotron/Humongotron. #NBAFinals
👑 https://t.co/lpU9KlNs5c
WOW. Fantastic photo from the cover of the @sfchronicle. Props to photographer Carlos Avila Gonzalez who captured this moment of Curry admiring his own work. #NBAFinals https://t.co/kbn4CP5ilT
NOW: Serena Williams is out of the French Open...but because of injury! Just announced she has to withdraw ahead of her match with Sharapova. Damn! Damn! Damn! #RolandGarros18
Steph Curry has set an #NBAFinals record ... with 9 3-pointers.
Coach Lue has pulled the starters. Waving the white flag. "We'll see you in Cleveland." #NBAFinals
Who is this Steph Curry guy? He appears to be good at basketball. 😳#NBAFinals
LeBron James has not sat for a single second of this game. #NBAFinals
So caught up that I'm tweeting typos. #saltnpepa https://t.co/F8BBIn0mUo
If y'all didn't know, Salt-n-Pepa are doing the halftime show. I'll be back with your shortly. #NBAFinals
Now they're chanting "MVP! MVP!" at JR Smith when he was at the free throw line. Oh my. #NBAFinals
JR Smith just got a HUGE ovation when he was introduced here at Oracle. All the other @cavs starters were booed. #NBAFinals
He wasn't kidding. Said the anthem would have some "fury" to it.  @drumstress turned that thing up! #NBAFinals #Santana
Don't miss the anthem tonight. @SantanaCarlos and @drumstress promise something you've never heard before. In fact, Santana called it a "barbecue ribs" version of the anthem. #NBAFinals https://t.co/t5FMaOLxe6
And let the Twitter church say ... Amen! I'll see y'all tonight...in Oakland. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't take on the identity of your biggest failures. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We may all be products of our environment but we don't have to be victims of our circumstances. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You will lose things. You will lose relationships. It doesn't mean you have to lose your soul in the process. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You show what you value by what you do with your success. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The storm you go through will blow away some things in your life that you didn't have the strength to get rid of yourself. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When you come out of a storm, you should have a different level of faith, gratitude, humility, empathy, understanding, and patience. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The failures of your past power your future ... and many of us have advanced degrees from the University of Adversity.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
Brokenness is fertilizer for an extraordinary harvest. Turn your pain into power. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Who in your life can say this to you?: "No matter what you tell me, I'm going to love you anyway." #SundayService @BishopBronner

Happiness is not the goal of life. Happiness is the byproduct of purpose. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you really want answers, ask:  -- What burdens you? -- What breaks your heart? -- What makes you cry? -- What makes you angry? #SundayService @BishopBronner
We become the size of the dreams that we are courageous enough to pursue. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't just want what you once had. You should want things you've never had before. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Brokenness is the opposite of arrogance and pride. Brokenness is surrender. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It's not what you get that makes you valuable.  It's the person you become that makes you valuable. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You might want to immediately change your circumstances, but it could be YOU who needs to change immediately. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It is purpose that makes sense of the chaos. #SundayService @BishopBronner
(2/2) There are plenty of times your willpower is broken but you go on (why?) because people depend on you, bills have to be paid, etc. #WHYpower  #SundayService @BishopBronner

Your ability to endure difficult situations is directly proportional to the clarity of your purpose. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't fight the brokenness of life.  You have to be broken before your greatness can be birthed. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't expect the blows in life NOT to come, but hope you have the support and experience to cushion those blows. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Happy Sunday! #SundayService is back!  Y'all, this one is ... something and has me in a great spirit this morn. Moving, timely, and for EVERYBODY. Here we go! #BreakingBirthingBuilding @BishopBronner

In a letter to Kim Jong Un, Pres Trump says "based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it's inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting."
NOW: President Trump has canceled the planned summit with North Korea and President Kim Jong Un.
I think the other parents here at swim class know: this isn't coffee in my thermos. #RoyalWedding #BabySabine
Have to step away now from #RoyalWedding coverage...I have to get my little princess to swim class!!!
This is not just because of today, but we can all admit: Harry has always been our favorite. #RoyalWedding
My peeps, @RobinRoberts and @DavidMuir...cute to see them turn into little kids as the procession goes right by them. #RoyalWedding
Look, I hadn't really gotten into these two before today. But this wedding has made me fall for them. #RoyalWedding
How much y'all think she practiced that? #GodsavetheQueen #Royalwedding

I've learned in my life that anytime a black pastor says "I'm wrapping up" ... you should get comfortable. But take your time, Mr.  Curry. I'm loving this. #RoyalWedding
Is he running for ANYTHING? Because I'd very much like to vote for him. #Curry #Loveistheway #RoyalWedding
"Love is the way!" #RoyalWedding
Curry is this #RoyalWedding's ... Pippa.
We have a breakout star of this #RoyalWedding: Rev Michael Bruce Curry. #Love

Who is this brother talking about love?! I am LOVING him. #RoyalWedding
I stand by my earlier statement. https://t.co/7wUVBOcdZy
They're giggling. This is too cute. #RoyalWedding
She might be the happiest bride I've ever seen. (Yes, I said that) #RoyalWedding
"Prince Harry doesn't look very happy. She is not serious." I'm tweeting my 5-year-old daughter's commentary. 😂😂😂 #RoyalWedding
Harry is swaying a little too much for my comfort. He's either nervous or already bored. Love this dude.  #RoyalWedding
They look like two happy people who'd be totally satisfied getting married in Cancun. #RoyalWedding
They look like kids. They're having a good time. #RoyalWedding
Harry, you done good, young fella. You done good. #RoyalWedding
These two little page boys are going to have a story to tell the rest of their lives. #RoyalWedding
Her mom. This is the first glimpse of someone that made me somewhat emotional. Forget all the royal this and that ... this is a mom supporting her baby on wedding day. #RoyalWedding
Warms your heart to see these two brothers together. We LOVE them because of their mother and we've know them their whole lives. #RoyalWedding
Prince Harry ... looks simply .... perfect. #RoyalWedding
This is just so damn cool. An American is in a Rolls Royce provided to her by the Queen of England and holding the hand of her momma from Crenshaw on the way to marry a prince. #RoyalWedding
See! This is what I was afraid was coming!!!! 😂 https://t.co/Vp6wPWZcZu
I hope it's nothing major. Everybody has one snafu on wedding day. #15minutedelay #RoyalWedding
Oh no. Meghan has pushed back her time by 15 minutes. I only say "oh no"...because I know the jokes/comments that are coming. #RoyalWedding
You sure?! That thing is fantastic! #beardornobeard #royalwedding https://t.co/0Ja7tpvMhL
THE question: beard or no beard for Prince Harry on his wedding day? #RoyalWedding
I didn’t even know: her first name is Rachel. #RoyalWedding
#RoyalWedding coverage became the "Oprah Winfrey Show" for a while. Cameras were fixed on her as she walked in. (Would loved to have been her plus-one.)
Anybody else set their alarm for 4am ON A SATURDAY in order to wake up and watch this wedding?!?! #RoyalWedding

Two recordings, yes. Of the same word: laurel. https://t.co/2fzzmvqUrH
A lot of people are hearing "yanny." And that's OK. However, "laurel" is what's being said. Does that mean you're crazy?  Probably. 😜 https://t.co/HfbEgzf6yn
AMEN! https://t.co/fzVEM03WC6
I don't doubt that you HEAR "yanny."  However, "yanny" IS NOT what's being said in the recording. https://t.co/nDSpyNSiOI
It might mean you have an ability to hear higher frequencies. https://t.co/ELTfLAKhxI
There should not be a question mark after the word "SOLVED." :-) This is a wrap! No more mystery! No more arguing from you Yanny people. It's #Laurel. @GMA https://t.co/aUypqIK9TI
CONFIRMED: It's "Laurel."  And I don't want to hear ---- else about this! #solved #Laurelforthewin #Yanny https://t.co/ssZhRsag31
And let the twitter church say...Amen!  I told you it was short and sweet today. Happy Mother's Day to you all! #SundayService @BishopBronner
What ordinary thing do you have that you can use to make a supernatural or extraordinary blessing in someone else's life? #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sometimes, you wait for the storm to calm. But other times, the storm will rage on, and you have to be the calm one. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Just because you're strong doesn't mean you don't get exhausted. Don't confuse exhaustion for weakness. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Favor comes from being faithful in unseen places. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Most people want relief...not a cure.  That's why most people don't change. #SundayService @BishopBronner
A hug, a smile, a compliment, an apology, a phone call, a home-cooked meal. What seems ordinary can be the seed of something supernatural to another. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The supernatural begins with the ordinary. You have ordinary things in your power that can be an extraordinary blessing to someone. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning! Sorry! I know, I know ... I've missed a couple of Sundays, but #SundayService is back! A short and sweet one for you today. Here we go! @BishopBronner

Prosecutor believes Bill Cosby is a flight risk based on his wealth. Cosby lashed out in court after the verdict that he "doesn't have a plane, asshole!"

Don't let somebody else's accident become your tragedy.  Sometimes you have to get off the road or off the ride...and let go. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Somebody in life gave you a word that motivated you. Somebody else needs that from you now. Just a word. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There is no such thing as a self-made man/woman. Somebody helped you, believed in you, prayed for you, encouraged you, counseled you, coached you. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Good Sunday morning. Was hoping @BishopBronner would work King T'Challa &amp; #BlackJeopardy into #SundayService, but I digress. So, here we go!!
Good lord, @Drake.  I hardly even heard the lyrics, but "Nice For What" is beautiful. https://t.co/EUM9hUAUCo
The sweater doesn't get me past security at Manhattan spots, but in Fayetteville, it's my all-access pass!  And, @coachchadmorris is the real deal! Can't wait for kickoff!  @SJTuohy @RazorbackFB @UArkansas #WPS https://t.co/uKd3h2gpbh
I hope to be an inspiration to C students everywhere! #WPS https://t.co/nSiMlU0k21
Ohhhh, that's why I'm feeling like this: it's 10pm ET, and the 1st half isn't over. Don't know whether to grab a blankie and pillow ... or a 5 Hour Energy. #NationalChampionship
Thanks, bruh. https://t.co/LVuYqKwvgm
Dammit! I missed the @chadwickboseman intro because I was bouncing around. TNT, Trutv, TBS, CBS. I couldn't find the right broadcast for the #NationalChampionship! #FinalFour
The women's #FinalFour has been the BEST ball I've watched all year. #NDvsMSST
I CAN NOT BELIEVE WHAT I JUST SAW!!!!!!! #FinalFour #NDvsMSST
They are at it again!  Tied with less than a minute to play in the women's  national championship!!!! #FinalFour #NDvsMSST
The women have put on an absolute show in the #FinalFour in Columbus. Every game... and tonight is no different. #NDvsMSST
They need to measure the diameter on the rims. Villanova's have to be much wider than the Kansas rims. #raining3s #FinalFour
Still, no #11 seed has ever won a game in the #FinalFour.
As @JalenRose's grandmother would say, "it's over."  Congrats to @RamblersMBB for giving us THE story of the tournament.  It has been a joy to watch them and #SisterJean. #FinalFour
That's not a good sign! #SisterJean has left the game.. with 1:30 left to play and Loyola down by 10. #FinalFour
#BrotherMo Wagner. #FinalFour
Look who decided to show up!!! #Michigan starting to look like ... Michigan. #FinalFour
Amazingly, Michigan has tied this game. Wagner is THE man of the hour. #FinalFour
Lord have mercy. Loyola-Chicago is up 7 at halftime...and 20 minutes away from history. #FinalFour
I can only hope the fellas from Villanova, KU, Loyola, &amp; Michigan can come close to putting on the kind of show the ladies of Miss St, Louisville, UConn, &amp; Notre Dame put on last night. #FinalFour
Come on, bruh. You know what's in that cup. ☕️➕🥃 @GMA https://t.co/suQhA0xGbn
To whom would I be donating them? https://t.co/cfKXDNupfh
NOW: Louisiana AG just announced they will not seek charges against the officers involved in the shooting death of #AltonSterling.
Who in their right mind is going to trash talk #SisterJean, a 98-year-old NUN?  Well, a 100 year old. #MarchMadness https://t.co/ln5ON7bHE8

"It's too cold and snowy to look like that." Direct quote from #BabySabine commenting on the wardrobe of the backup dancers on @GMA. #Themouthsofbabes
#BabySabine has had more snow days the past 2 years in NYC...than I had in 18 years growing up in Arkansas!!!! #Noreaster4 https://t.co/ann269n0Ff
Some schools in the Boston area have had so many snow days this year that kids are being asked to come to school on Saturdays or give up spring break days. @GMA #noreaster
By the way, this is the first full day of spring. #noreaster @GMA 🌼
3000+ flights have already been cancelled due to the nor'easter.  @GMA @RobMarciano ✈️❄️
The 4th nor'easter in the past 3 weeks is hitting right now. @GMA
Police were able to use FedEx tracking information to figure out the drop-off locations the suspect used for the bombs.  #Austinbombings @GMA
People are asked to stay vigilant. Suspect might have left explosive packages behind. @GMA
Suspected Austin bomber is a 24-year-old white male. Police believe he's dead after blowing himself up as police closed in last night. @GMA
Help ... @hulu OR @netflix?  #onlyone
It's was next on my list. But ... "Wrap!!" Never enough TV time. But congrats. You all took out a Final Four favorite. https://t.co/8scH0nUEnW
This tournament has me in tears ... for the winners AND the losers. #Nevada #MarchMadness
Texas A&amp;M is showing out...and about to send the defending champs (and a lot of y'all's Final Four pick) home. #MarchMadness
Show me your bracket that has Loyola-Chicago IN the Sweet 16 but has Michigan State OUT. #MarchMadness
I know a lot of y'all have Michigan State in your #FinalFour ... and are sweatin' it out right now. #MarchMadness
Oh my. Tiger is 1 shot back of the lead...and is distracting me from #MarchMadness!!!!!!!    #ArnoldPalmerInvitational
Apologies. @BishopBronner wasn't there today. There was a substitute ... but I don't know him like that!! ;-)  #SundayService https://t.co/eYzHPfjLVV
The ONLY reason my TV is turning away from #MarchMaddness today for even a moment ... is because Tiger is on the leaderboard. #ArnoldPalmerInvitational
You can't ever go to sleep when this tournament is on. This is the greatest thing in sports. #buzzerbeater #Michigan #MarchMadness
THE unrivaled star of the NCAA tournament ... is a 98-year-old woman. #SisterJean #Loyola #MarchMadness 🙏🏽

I don't even like basketball. It's a dumb sport. #ButlervsArkansas #MarchMadness
I've enjoyed the tournament ... up until this moment. Now, I'm freaking OUT!!!!! #ButlervsArkansas #MarchMadness
Folks are gonna wake up to their ugly brackets tomorrow. #Arizona #MarchMadness
Arizona fans and pickers: "Buffa-loh-no." #MarchMadness
Is it time for an official upset alert? #4 seed Arizona is down by TEN to Buffalo. #MarchMadness
Sure, I have @GMA in the morning. But I won't sleep until the last horn sounds on the last game of the night. #MarchMadness https://t.co/qXwmL5PSA3
I have no dog in this fight ... but these brothers from Buffalo are an inspiration.  #MarchMadness
Correction: this Houston-SDST game is insane!!!!! #MarchMadness
This feels like the game of the day. #SFAvsTXTech #MarchMadness
There it is!!!! Your buzzer beater of the day! This tournament always delivers!!!! #Loyola #MarchMadness
Oklahoma is one ... and done. The most controversial at-large selection is out. Will this be the last time we see Trae Young play in college? #MarchMadness
The FIRST game of the day is going to overtime. I love this tournament!!!!!! #MarchMadness @GStephanopoulos @CeciliaVega @michaelstrahan
This is happening. Now. I'm near tears. I'm so happy. #MarchMadness
I never posted this, but it's one of my favorite pics from the #SuperBowl in Minneapolis.  Ran… https://t.co/aNEYQEwqJS
Ousting of Tillerson was "not related to one issue in particular," WH offficials tell our @CeciliaVega. Trump asked for Tillerson's resignation on Friday. #Tillerson
From the president himself... Sec. of State Rex Tillerson is out. https://t.co/kDaAOyxk4J

#BabySabine just asked to take the TV from me on...SELECTION SUNDAY!!... so she could watch a movie. I happily obliged. #SelectionShow
Now, they're eating pizza. #SelectionShow
I would pay to have a live feed of the Turner control room right now. #SelectionShow
I can't remember watching a bigger big-stage cluster. #SelectionShow
What the .... !!! The lights just went out in the studio where they're interviewing the selection committee chairman! Turner is having a disastrous moment. #SelectionShow
"Let me tell you everybody who is in. But after the break, we'll tell you who you'll play and where you're playing." Yo..I'm about to switch over the NASCAR. #SelectionShow
Maybe I'm just a creature of habit, but I miss the old #SelectionShow...when they revealed the teams by regions and seeding.
Bro!!! This is ridiculous. https://t.co/JNkqecQerf
Are you kidding me!!??? It's not fixed.   The #SelectionShow is a #LipSyncBattle between Greg Gumble and Ernie Johnson.
Is this just my cable malfunctioning ... or do they need to sync the audio with the mouths of these guys? #SelectionShow #MarchMadness
Uhhh .... is this a rough start for the #Selectionshow? #lipsync #MarchMadness
Tiger. Miss watching him on a Sunday. Birdied from 44' on 17. If he birdies the 18th, he ties for the lead. #Valspar
College bball was supposed to be the only thing on my TV today BUT...Tiger is near the top of the leaderboard!
And let the twitter church say...Amen.  Let's be kind this week. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every time you are tempted to quit ... remember why you started. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The difference between who you are now and who you want to be ... is what you do with the time in between. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can change ANY moment you decide. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Never quit something with long-term potential just because you're having trouble dealing with the stress of the moment. #SundayService @BishopBronner
No lie lives forever. Time will expose it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Patience is a secret weapon that forces evil to reveal itself. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Some of us overlook our blessing because it doesn't look the way we think it should. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Your blessing doesn't always come assembled.  Sometimes, you're sent a blessing that needs work and that you have to help make. #SundayService @BishopBronner
i.e. If you didn't love me while I was riding the bus, don't come trying to love me while I'm rolling in my limo. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If someone can't love you in your mess, they can't love you when you're at your best. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The person that really loves you has a grace to deal with you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Real love doesn't meet you at your best.  Real love meets you in your mess. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We need a kindness revolution. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You never know who needs a kind gesture from you. Be kind this week. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You don't know what people are going through. They may be smiling on the outside and crying on the inside. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The older you get the less impressed you are with rich people, important people, famous people...&amp; the more enamored you become with kind people. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It's nice to be important.  But it's more important to be kind. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Waiting is difficult ... when you're suffering. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It always pays to do right, even when no one is looking. #SundayService @BishopBronner
It may look like you're getting away with something.  But really, your payback is just being delayed. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You're going to get a PAYOFF for doing what's right. You'll get a PAYBACK for doing what's wrong. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning. I needed this #SundayService.  I'm hoping something in here will speak to you as well.  Here we go! @BishopBronner
Wooooooooooo Pig Soooieeeeee!!!!! #SECTourney #WPS #Semis #FLAvsARK

Sting and Shaggy afterparty at GMA https://t.co/CU72tZQ67k
There are some days you REALLY can't believe you get paid to do this for a living. When you get Shaggy AND Sting...on the same morning.  Dang. @GMA
Oh, wait ... I don't have time for any #TheBachelor foolishness this morning.  This is a day to be on my best behavior. @Oprah @GMA https://t.co/qXqbnIpd2G
Pulling up to the studio now.  So, where is my main man Arie?  I'll go introduce myself. #TheBachelor @GMA https://t.co/rMgeWKxTbO
Respect that he changed his mind. But he didn't have to do her like that in front of cameras. And his answers to my boy @michaelstrahan this morning....😒 https://t.co/LtoRvnq6LH
Ya know what...I'm glad I'm not at the studio right now. I might have to have words with this Arie fella. (Headed there now, however.) #TheBachelor @GMA @TheRachLindsay
Sorry I missed you! Wanted to stick around to say hello...but lurking outside of your dressing room was starting to get weird. 😳 https://t.co/Lynzop9Xff
You can get your guaranteed $1500 bonus ...or take chance at winning a $100k bonus. What would you do? My @GMA colleagues were unanimous. #United https://t.co/7ZTt0XpfjD

Still... they can’t end this show quite right. #Oscars
Admit it ....Your heart skipped a half a beat at least when Warren Beatty had trouble getting the card out of the envelope.  #BestPicture #Oscars
This is kinda perfect that they have these two back this year to present #BestPicture. #Oscars
I’ve been saying that to myself for 20 years. https://t.co/h9v4oXqnjM
Frances McDormand just created a moment by having all the female nominees in every category stand, but said don’t just recognize us, work with us. #Oscars
He left his car running, right? He treated the #Oscars like a stop at the convenience store. https://t.co/2vxtaWAt8k
Is that the first glimpse of Denzel we’ve seen all night? Where you been, bruh? #Oscars
An hour ago he was serving sandwiches across the street ...now he has an Oscar! :-) #Oscars #BestDirector
Are we down the big 4?: best actor, actress, director, and picture? Gee, look at the time.  #Oscars
And let’s not forget the Triple 6 Mafia. #HardOutHereForAPimp https://t.co/rzODVHVugu
I have not come down from that #thisIsMe performance yet. #Oscars @kealasettle
This is the best collection of musical performances at an #Oscars show I can remember.
“Gonna send a flood, Gonna drown ‘em out....this is brave. This is bruised. I am who I’m meant to be. This is me!” #Oscars
I’m eagerly awaiting @kealasettle. #ThisIsMe has been one of favorite songs of the past year. #Oscars
“My mother who taught me to love even in the face of hate.” — @JordanPeele #Oscars #BestOriginalScreenplay
Say whaaaaaaaaaat!!! Go Jordan!  #GetOut #Oscars
That entire video was about diversifying the industry beyond white men. I’m not keeping count but who’s winning all the awards so far tonight? #Oscars
Best original song. This is the category I’m torn about: This is Me, Stand Up For Something, Mighty River. #Oscars
Did @Common just come with an #Oscars version of this song?! 🔥
I just want Chappelle and Common and Andra to keep going and going and going .... #Oscars.
WOW! Live action short acceptance speech.  #Oscars
God love her ... But I was holding my breath for Tiffany Haddish to have to read a name. #Oscars
Lin-Manuel Miranda and Guillermo del Toro carrying a 6’ sub is the highlight of the #Oscars.
Ok. It worked. That’s pretty cool. #Oscars
This could potentially be awesome...Kimmel walking a group of stars across the street to surprise unsuspecting moviegoers. #Oscars
I know Jordan has one more ring than Kobe...but I have a feeling he won’t let this stand. My prediction: Jordan will win a best actor #Oscar within 5 years. #Oscars
5 NBA titles in 7 trips to the Finals. But Kobe is now undefeated at the #Oscars. Crazy!
This is a professional athlete who planned for retirement. #Kobe #Oscars
Kobe Bryant just won a friggin’ Oscar! #Oscars
They won’t give #starWars an Oscar so...you get to present! #Oscars
Love her. I have a great Allison Janney story..involving Vegas, the two of us in a bathroom line, and her stealing my drink. Hope she gives me permission to tell it one day. #Oscars
Ha! “I did it all by myself.” — Allison Janey. #Oscars #BestSupportingActress
How many of y’all are googling “Lake Havasu” right now? #Oscars
And I forgot... Viola was in the first 45 minutes too! #OscarskindaBlack #Oscars
Taraji P. Mary J. #GetOut. #BlackPanther. I’m not saying we’ve made it to the mountaintop but, in the first 45 minutes...#OscarskindaBlack. #Oscars
You can’t tell me your heart rate did not elevate with that performance. #Oscars #maryJ
Lord have mercy, @maryjblige. #Oscars
These guys from #Icarus are going to party harder than any other winner tonight. #Oscars
#BlackPanther seems to be the most talked about movie at the #Oscars!
That dude must have waterfront property. His acceptance speech was under 30 seconds. He wants that jet ski. #Oscars
Kimmel has me working my stopwatch.  #Oscars #jetski
I really wish Wonder Woman and the Black Panther would have been paired as presenters. #Oscars #Gal&amp;Chadwick
Sam Rockwell...was pumped!  Folks pulled him out of school to go see a movie. Now he’s got an Oscar. I feel better about my parenting choices. #Oscars #BabySabine
Loving Kimmel. GREAT idea: shortest acceptance speech gets a prize. #jetski  #Oscars
Timothee Chalamet “is missing Paw Patrol to be here tonight.” #Oscars
Jimmy Kimmel is on it! He is hitting every theme and every relevant happening in the business. #Oscars
“Imagine a county with a Black leader.  Wouldn’t that be something?” OK. That was kinda funny.  #WakandaForever #Oscars
A shot a Trump within the first 2 minutes. #Oscars
Interesting open. #blackandwhite #Oscars
I want to have drinks with Mahershala Ali. #Oscars
How can you not root for this kid?! He even gave a shout out for public arts funding. #TimotheeChalamet #Oscars
That’s adorable. Timothee Chalamet hanging with his mom at the #Oscars.
What the hell is Danny Glover going off about behind Jennifer Garner? #Oscars
Taraji P. Henson just admitted she crashed a Maserati while filming “Proud Mary.” So I certainly wouldn’t get mad if she crashed my Chevy. #Oscars
There should not be a word short of “incredible” used to describe @maryjblige tonight. #Oscars #Mudbound
Daniel Kaluuya is rocking the hell out of that jacket. #Oscars #GetOut
I WILL NOT stop ... until I master this hairstyle for #BabySabine. Amazing. #KellyMarieTran #TheLastJedi https://t.co/aPblMZ4JHi
Chadwick Boseman being real coy about his conversation with Denzel Washington. I understand. #Oscars #BlackPanther
If I could sound like Patrick Stewart for just a few days, my career would really take off. #thatvoice #Oscars
“We’re never done with the conversation about race...this movie plugged some hole and inspired more conversation that’s needed today.” — @JordanPeele #Oscars #GetOut  ✊🏾
Am I the only one who has been madly in love with Alison Janney since The West Wing? #Oscars
I mean...I just...I don’t know what to...I mean...ugh.   #RyanSeacrest #Oscars
Every Friday, #BabySabine takes something to school for "show &amp;  share/tell" that begins with the letter the class has studied for the week. Last week was the letter "V."  Her choice: vibranium. I just love it.   #BlackPanther https://t.co/TIGlzAdZ5y
And let the twitter church say ... Amen!  I'll see y'all in a little bit for #Oscars90.  #GetOut @BishopBronner #SundayService

When a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower, i.e. you might need to pluck some weeds from your life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You are being called into destiny while the enemy is trying to lock you into history. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You ARE NOT what you have done.  Don't get locked in the history of your past behavior. #SundayService @BishopBronner
The enemy knows you by name ... but calls you by your sin. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Once you establish something, you have to stand your ground to protect it. The hard work of establishing it was only the beginning. #sundayService @BishopBronner

Remember, there's a snake is every garden. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good morning, and happy Oscar Sunday. But before #GetOut is announced as the winner, let me give you your #SundayService.  Here we go! @BishopBronner
And let the twitter church say ... AMEN!  Whew. @BishopBronner was on it today. I hope you got at least a little something out of #SundayService!
You are not buried.  You're planted.  When you're in a down time in your life, don't make the mistake of thinking you're not coming back up. #SundayService @BishopBronner

Pain is a wake-up call.  It's notifying you that something has to change. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Guard your thoughts. Thoughts become words. Words become actions. Actions become habits. Habits mold character. Character shapes lifestyle. #SundayService @BishopBronner
A DREAM written down becomes a GOAL. A GOAL broken down into steps becomes a PLAN. A PLAN backed by action becomes a DREAM COME TRUE. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Stagnation is the consequence of defending rather than exploring. #SundayService @BishopBronner
A real curse is to remain in the place where you are. Never growing. Never changing. A curse chains you to where you are. #SundayService @BishopBronner

The best growth comes when you nurture what nature has given.  If by nature, you have been given a talent...you still must nurture it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Set a goal so big that you can't achieve it until you grow into the person who can. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Whatever you feed, will grow. That includes...your doubts.  So feed your faith, starve your doubts. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You have to water and nurture whatever it is you want to grow. #SundayService @BishopBronner

"Again" #ParklandSchoolShooting https://t.co/XSO8G8ylvI
The president has wrapped his comments. Did not mention gun control. Reporter shouted question to him about gun control as he left the room. President did not respond. #ParklandSchoolShooting
"It is not enough to take action that makes us feel like we are making a difference" -- Trump #ParklandSchoolShooting
President Trump says we need to tackle the "difficult issue of mental health." #ParklandSchoolShooting

"No child, no teacher should ever be in danger at an American school" -- Pres. Trump #ParklandSchoolShooting

Pres. Trump speaking now. #ParklandSchoolShooting
Press conference has wrapped. President Trump expected to address the nation soon. #ParklandSchoolShooting
Asked specifically if his conversation with lawmakers will include talk of gun control, Gov. Scott says his focus will be on "school safety and dollars" and how to keep mentally ill from getting guns. #ParklandSchoolShooting
There was an armed resource officer at the school but never encountered the shooter. -- sheriff #ParklandSchoolShooting
Citing privacy rights, superintendent won't say why the suspect was expelled from school or give details of his disciplinary records. #ParklandSchoolShooting
Sheriff is pleading with people: if you see something, say something. "If there's something in your gut that tells you there's something not right with this person..." #ParklandSchoolShooting
Sheriff says no indication at this time that shooter specifically targeted anyone at the school. #ParklandSchoolShooting

HA!  Yeah, it's a new thing.  Wonder if it'll catch on nationally! 😍 https://t.co/FeQjrRzAx2
Philly...I can't imagine. Congrats. #SuperBowl
Place your bets! Place your bets! 1 minute. Down by 8. 90+ yards to go. Ball in Tom Brady's hand. Who ya got? #SuperBowl
That Eagles defense we have heard so much about ... might have just won Philly its first #SuperBowl.
Eagles are up. Congrats. Oh, wait ... Tom Brady gets the ball with 2+ minutes (an eternity) to work with. I'll check back in with you shortly. #SuperBowl
This ref broke it DOWN. "What had happened was ... dude caught it right?  But then he went from a receiver to a runner ... and crossed the line ... and boom! Touchdown!" #SuperBowl
This game has been an absolute blast! #SuperBowl
Foles has been fantastic. 🤜🏽 https://t.co/UGF3iAc8hG
Nick Foles has been cool as a cucumber this game. If he can keep it up for a few more minutes, they just might pull this off. #SuperBowl
Uh oh. 4th and 1. #SuperBowl
And just like that, the Patriots are up, and we seem to be back to a familiar  script. #SuperBowl
That dude. #Gronk #SuperBowl
How do you see this thing ending? #SuperBowl
I know there's a great @Hyundai ad coming up this quarter. Tell me what you think of it after you stop crying. ❤️#SuperBowl
I don't even know how to wrap my head around that!!!! https://t.co/qCOLIBb61c
That's the "Dirty Dancing" ad? They played that one in the stadium. Well done, fellas. It's hilarious. https://t.co/bGceL1ZlXs
It's the 4th quarter, and I'm just NOW realizing @JoelEmbiid is in the building. How the hell did I miss HIM? #SuperBowl
What have I missed on the commercials front tonight?  The good? The bad? The ridiculous? #SuperBowl
These reviews are intense. 70,000 people get quiet waiting on a judge (ref) to deliver a verdict. #superBowl
Several Eagles players came back out and were wandering the sideline waiting for JT to finish. #gottagametoplay #SuperBowl
Well, it wasn't a hologram. #SuperBowl #Prince

Stage almost set. JT is apparently going to be in the crowd at the start of his performance...and walk across that bridge to the field. #SuperBowl https://t.co/j3IRLIiusP
They just played Prince's #superBowl performance on the big screen... before JT's halftime show. Man, good luck.
"Your QB may be the #GOAT but our  quarterback can catch!" #Eagles #superBowl
This is an entertaining first half. Don't turn away. Gronk might kick a field goal for all we know. #SuperBowl
Seems like the loudest boos of the night in @usbankstadium...just went to @StephenCurry30 when they flashed him on the big screen.  #ThisaintOracle #SuperBowl
That play will live in infamy.  The greatest quarterback of all time ... can't catch. (Hey, he's not supposed to.) #SuperBowl
They got Brandin Cooks up and he walked off the field. That hit was not replayed on the big screen here in the stadium. #SuperBowl
Oh my god. #SuperBowl
WWE is looking up McCleod's agent right now. #slam #SuperBowl
A missed PAT? Let's make a mental note of that. #SuperBowl
They just showed an Eagles-Rocky hype video in the stadium. Eagles fans going nuts with the Rocky theme music playing. #SuperBowl
Finally ... football! #SuperBowl https://t.co/hkRzgzlvhy

It's very possible you've missed me complementing the kindness of Minnesotans, missed me adoring @HenHouseEatery, missed my fun with Minnesota residents during @GMA Friday. I pray it's not possible you're this negative of a person. https://t.co/mvAmN0nEi4
OK, you actually just made me laugh. https://t.co/V3C4ysVLVH

New England is down by 3 in the 4th. So why does it feel like JAX is the team that has to score in order to win the game? #NEbeingNE #AFCChampionship

I'm embarrassed that my jealously is so apparent.  I have to do better in 2018. But Jesse is just so ... awesome.  I can't stand it. https://t.co/3tVgyx0vDS
Don't cry for Jesse!  Despite my TV trash talk, we didn't want him to go.  Problem was, everybody wants to hire Jesse!  What you heard from me on TV were the delusional ramblings of a jealous man. #haterade https://t.co/k8ZXRcYI9S

And let the twitter church say... a final AMEN for 2017!  Happy New Year, folks! #SundayService @BishopBronner
For 2018:  Express gratitude everyday Read everyday Plan your next day the night b4 Keep goals in front of you Make health a priority Nurture significant relationships Learn from people u admire Even when it's scary, take action #SundayService @BishopBronner
Some of the greatest lessons in life you'll ever learn come from empty pockets, empty stomachs, and broken hearts. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Learning is a gift ... even when pain is the teacher. #SundayService @BishopBronner
We change when we're hurt enough ... that we have to change. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Practically every decision to change your life is based on how tired you are of a situation. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You survived the battle/storm/abuse/turmoil, so now what makes you think you won't survive the recovery?! #SundayService @BishopBronner
You survived! No matter how bad the days have been, you got out alive! #SundayService @BishopBronner
You're blessed ... because you don't look like what you've been through. If you told people the truth of what you've really been through, they wouldn't believe you. #SundayService @BishopBronner
REMEMBER THIS:  So far, you have survived 100% of your worst days. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Faith that is not tested can not be trusted. #sundayService @BishopBronner
Write down how you define happiness and fulfillment. Then write down what you do daily. If the two lists don't match, make adjustments to your life. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When you don't know who you are, you're destined to misbehave. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't wait until you go into a battle/storm to try to figure out who you are. Know who you are and whose you are BEFORE the storm. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Next year will be as great as you set up your heart and mind for it to be.  #SundayService @BishopBronner
Happy New Year? What about a happy new YOU!?! #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can have a new year every time you develop a new strategy, have a new idea, a new thought, or a new perspective. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Nothing magical happens at the stroke of midnight tonight. Rather, you can have a new year every time you make a new decision. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good morning! And happy NYE!  @BishopBronner came correct ... with a great final #SundayService of 2017. There'll be something in here for YOU! Here we go!
Nothing wrong w/that, sista! Problem, critics say, is not that casual players buy a ticket once in a while when jackpots get huge. It's the false hope targeted at poorer folks who spend disproportionate amount of income year-round on lottery. https://t.co/e2FEkRV8xc
They changed the odds to make it harder to hit jackpots, so the numbers go higher. When they go higher, we cover the story &amp; fuel "fever"/ticket sales even more. We all have fallen for it. https://t.co/2ZXAjkpe3g
Odds: 1 in 292 million of hitting Powerball jackpot. 1 in 303 million for MegaMillions. THAT is reality! ;-) But hey, folks can #keephopealive if they want to! https://t.co/KD9rvxzKSv

And let the twitter church say...Amen! Don't give up too soon! That was the subject of @BishopBronner's sermon today. I hope it sticks with you this week! #sundayService
Have the mind of a protege, the mouth of a mentor, the hands of a servant, and the heart of a warrior. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Absence sharpens love.  Presence strengthens it. (I'm still trying to decipher this one, but it sounds good.) #SundayService @BishopBronner

The man who has an argument will always be at the mercy of the man who has experience. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Sometimes, you don't just cut people off. Sometimes, YOU are the one assigned to reach people. #SundayService @BishopBronner
When you think too much about yourself, you get sick. Narcissism is a disease that will infect your soul. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every time you stand up to try, instead of sitting down to quit ... you win. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You don't realize what you're doing IS working.  But the enemy makes you feel like what you're doing IS NOT working. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Never give up on something you really want.  It's difficult to wait ... but it's more difficult to regret. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Almost" might be the saddest word in the world. ("She almost won." "He almost made it." "They almost saved her.") #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't stop too soon! You don't realize how close you are. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning! Missed past couple of weeks for various reasons but #SundayService is back! This one is just for YOU! Here we go! @BishopBronner
Sometimes this city can really show out. #Christmasvibes @NYSE https://t.co/GI72G3Hqxy
Houston, I think it's adorable that you enjoyed our time together so much. I loved it too. But you have to let me go. #HoustonSnow #travelfun #deicerdrama #stillhere
If this pilot ends another announcement with "we appreciate your patience"...  #HoustonSnow #travelfun
So, they rush us back onto the plane. Tell us the deicer truck is fixed. Now, "the city of Houston has closed the deicing ramp for cleanup." We again sit on the taxiway. #HoustonSnow #travelfun
You have a better idea? #HoustonSnow #travelfun #deicerdrama https://t.co/fwVaUCXdx9
I'm laughing on the inside. Lady is upset &amp; threatening to use another airline. "You're gong to have the same problem, ma'am. There's only one deicer truck and it's broken." #HoustonSnow #travelfun
Deplaning my delayed/soon-to-be-cancelled flight and thinking about last week, when I was in another H-Town (Honolulu) for a business trip.  #HoustonSnow #travelfun https://t.co/OzPafuRXrT
And this gem from the pilot: "The good news is, its starting to warm up, so the snow will melt off on its own...IN ABOUT AN HOUR." #HoustonSnow #travelfun
Pilot: "The part they put on the deicer truck did not get it working...we're going to be deplaning." #HoustonSnow #travelfun
Bruh, I ain't traveling at all! That's the problem! 🙏🏽🛫 https://t.co/okopWKDzaL
Pilot also apologized "for the smell" on our plane. We are parked beside other planes and their engine exhaust is seeping into our cabin. What's next, #HoustonSnow!?#travelfun
Too bad I had to be here for their practice run! 😂❄️ https://t.co/BbKWcf7lNR
Seriously, @Ginger_Zee ... qualify the "snowstorm" in Houston overnight?  It was a deicer truck breaker? #HoustonSnow #travelfun
Pilot says part has been replaced on deicer truck but they need to test it out. If this isn't resolved in 15 minutes, says we will have to deplane.  #HoustonSnow #travel
#HoustonSnow is not currently making me happy. https://t.co/DlUHhng8dN
Apparently it hasn't been used in a while ... because it broke this morning before 6am!!!!! https://t.co/TTtusZsTSi
Oh, Houston. Pilot just announced "the deicer truck is broken." We are stuck on the taxiway until it's fixed. I guess snow really is a new thing for y'all. #HoustonSnow #travelfun
Happened to be in Houston. Woke up &amp; saw #HoustonSnow was trending. Wondered if my flight would be cancelled. Then, I went outside. Y'all are too cute. https://t.co/FzbmHydfar

Conyers asked for a 'yes or no' on each of his questions. He never got either. #SessionsHearing
Conyers 3rd question: "Are you recused from investigations that involve Sec. Clinton?" #SessionsHearing
Conyers 2nd question: "Should the President of the United State make public comments that might influence an ongoing investigation?" #SessionsHearing
Conyers 1st question: "Is it common for the leader of the country to order the criminal justice system to retaliate against his political opponents?" #SessionsHearing

Sessions on not remembering meeting: "I would gladly have reported it if I had remembered it." #SessionsHearing #Russia

People get frustrated when they look at how far they have to go ... instead of looking at how far they've come. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There's "hell" in hello. There's "good" in goodbye. Some of your best days were seeing someone walk out of your life. #SundayService @BishopBronner

I can not accept that this #WorldSeries is going to end like this.
Dodger fans have been waiting almost 3 hours for something to cheer about. Finally, they got a run. Still, 5-1...but hey! #WorldSeries
This #WorldSeries has been too good to go out like this.
Hmmm... there was a drone just flying over Dodger Stadium.  I suspect it wasn't supposed to be there. #WorldSeries
And...silent no more.Kershaw has entered the game. He's pitching ...but they really need him to hit a 5-run homer. #nosuchthing #WorldSeries
And.... silence. #WorldSeries
Ok ... a little noise in Dodger Stadium now. A little. #WorldSeries
They just showed video of Kershaw warming up in the bullpen. Dodger Stadium came alive. #WorldSeries
It is so damn quiet in Dodger Stadium right now.  I could make a phone call. #WorldSeries
Holy hell. These Astros have already blown this thing wide open. 5-0 in the SECOND. Yu Darvish is out. #WorldSeries
Mood in Dodger Stadium is ... quiet. Anxious. Nervous. Dodger fans are all seated. #WorldSeries
So, it's gonna be THIS kinda game?!  I'm all for it! #WorldSeriesGame7
Game has been going on 5 minutes and the Astros already have more runs than they did last night. #WorldSeries
And just like that ... 1-0, Astros. #WorldSeries

"Today's announcement has nothing to do with the President or the President's campaign." -- Sanders at ongoing WH press briefing #Manafort
Here's the link if you'd like to read through the entire indictment yourself: https://t.co/3n2cemJO1r. #Manafort&amp;Gates
"...Manafort's tax filings for 2008 to 2014, Manafort represented falsely that he did not have authority over any foreign bank accounts"
"To conceal their scheme, Manafort and Gates developed a false and misleading cover story..."
"Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered agents of the Government of Ukraine. (They) generated tens of millions of dollars as a result.."
"More than $75,000,000 flowed through offshore accounts. Manafort laundered more than $18,000,000...income he concealed from US Treasury."
"In furtherance of the scheme, Manafort used hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle...without paying any taxes on that income."
"Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts."
Indictment accuses Manafort and Gates of hiding "tens of millions of dollars in incomes as a result of their Ukraine work" by laundering.
Indictment against Manafort and Gates includes charges of conspiracy against US, conspiracy to launder money, false statements.
Charges against Manafort are believed to be tied to his financial dealings and not particularly Russian collusion. @pierretABC @ABC
Paul Manafort &amp; deputy Rick Gates are expected to surrender to fed authorities. "First fruits" of Mueller investigation. @ABC @pierretABC

Trump says "@NFL should have suspended some of those players for 1 game." Says they should be suspended longer if they did it again. #anthem
"When you..take a knee or any other way, ur sitting essentially for our great nat anthem. Ur disrespecting our flag &amp; our country." -- Trump
President Trump just took a LOT of questions from reporters in rowdy scrum at White House. Final question was about anthem protests in NFL.

"He's not that fast. He's not that powerful. But he's composed." -- McGregor #MayweatherMcGregor
"He's a lot better than I thought he was." -- Mayweather #MayweatherMcGregor
Now listen to the post-fight interviews ...and how much they now praise each other. #conmen #MayweatherMcGregor
These commentators are giving McGregor credit for "not embarrassing himself." #mayweathermcgregor
They are gonna have to stop this fight. #MayweatherMcGregor
Ok. Floyd might have figured this dude out. If he's ahead going into the 12th, he should kick him for good measure. #mayweathermcgregor
I would not let this go to the scorecards. #MayweatherMcGregor
I am really not sure what's happening. Is this just Mayweather doing his thing? Or is McGregor legit? #MayweatherMcGregor
Still getting used to the sight of these two in a ring together. Mayweather seems to be getting used to it too. #MayweatherMcGregor
That was .... thrilling. #Round1 #MayweatherMcGregor
I'm freaking out. #MayweatherMcGregor
Ha! Ref emphasized this will be under "boxing rules." #MayweatherMcGregor
49-0 vs 0-0. Should be good. #MayweatherMcGregor
He's making no secret of the fact that he's robbing us tonight. #Skimask #mayweathermcgregor
Why, Floyd .... why?! #MayweatherMcGregor
Something just doesn't seem right about not having Michael Buffer for this one. #LetsGetReadyToRumble #MayweatherMcGregor
I was about to start talking about Floyd's "robe" but paused and realized ... "I love it." #MayweatherMcGregor
I can not believe this is really about to happen. #MayweatherMcGregor
Now I really need #MayweatherMcGregor to be an entertaining fight. If not, I'm gonna be staring at Steve Harvey and LeBron James all night.

I'm not sure what to make of McGregor's demeanor in his locker room interview with Jim Gray. Calm? Confident? Nervous?#MayweatherMcGregor
Not that it's better or worse, I'm just so accustomed to HBO Boxing coverage that I'm struggling to adjust to Showtime. #MayweatherMcGregor
Are the "Corona" girls contractually obligated to be in the background of this interview? #MayweatherMcGregor
If #MayweatherMcGregor has half the action of this Jack vs Cleverly undercard, I'll be OK with the $100.
McGregor makes a helluva entrance. Love the suit, scowl, strut, &amp; the fact that his baby is in a stroller next to him. #MayweathervMcgregor
To be clear: we are watching just in case McGregor can land one "you never know" punch, right? #MayweatherVsMcGregor
They have my $100. And they are really working to convince me that Conor McGregor has a chance. #MayweatherMcGregor

Asked if he'd agree to be the next Bachelor, Peter's response: "I'd have to think a lot about it." @GMA @Thebachelorette https://t.co/NBXp2VNino
Rachel, I can explain. @GMA #Teamneutral #TheBachelorette https://t.co/gozW8cE4qZ
So here's the real truth about why I, for the first time, followed a season of the Bachelorette:… https://t.co/QPatzhWl9U
They needed someone to do the interview who'd be calm and wasn't so emotionally and irrationally invested in #TheBachelerotteFinale. https://t.co/VdJb9CRho6
I will say it again: I am done. https://t.co/eDSjpDjY5N
Uh, yeah. But it was a little awkward meeting Bryan...given that I sent out several tweets last night that included: "#TeamPeter" https://t.co/8Q70eSxQiQ
(KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!) "Yo! It's TJ! You can't ignore me forever! Let me in! We need to talk!" @GMA @TheRachLindsay https://t.co/Ivpeswp7iR
I was a late check in and early check out. https://t.co/zpShejVhkh
Only watched this season for Rachel. Was open to other seasons. But now ... ✌🏾 https://t.co/yQ2h0Z2JK8
He was behaving normally BUT outside of the expedited parameters of a reality dating show. He was committed and careful but not on a clock. https://t.co/7lvhIGvgRF
You should seek help. Me?  I'm cool. https://t.co/XLidU9ZUy5
Even if the new Bachelor was MY brother. https://t.co/XJksFYqjIs
I'm quitting cold turkey. https://t.co/eaXCZc7sen
Then I wish him well.  But I won't be watching. https://t.co/X3YXBJL4IL
It will not happen. https://t.co/6EH2eFVtjr
I'm saying NEVER. https://t.co/7m0wgYf5ul
WILL NOT HAPPEN. https://t.co/ubTrVgSKrR
Appreciate you all hanging with me for what was my first and will be my last season as a member of #BachelorNation.  #TheBacheloretteFinale
"We aren't rushing anything.We want 2 get 2 know each other n a normal sense" Sounds like Peter. Rachel just said it. #TheBacheloretteFinale
I need to go back and delete some tweets. I have to see Rachel in the morning at @GMA. Don't want her to cuss me out. #TheBacheloretteFinale
I'm sorry.  What I meant to say was ... congratulations to the newly-engaged Rachel and Bryan! #TheBacheloretteFinale
Something ... ain't sittin' right with me.   #TheBacheloretteFinale
It's not just that she didn't pick my guy... there's something about this ending that not quite fulfilling. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Her head is somewhere in Wisconsin right now, and Bryan is trying to propose. #TheBacheloretteFinale
You ain't heard nothing yet ... If this show doesn't turn around in the next 30 minutes. https://t.co/4uMNPatoL4
They are totally messing with us. The only acceptable outcome now is for Kevin Durant to come out and propose. #TheBacheloretteFinale
They told us her fiance is there. She just said goodbye to Peter forever. Bryan is all that's left. WTH! #TheBacheloretteFinale
There are some serious shenanigans going on right now. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Hold up ... #TheBacheloretteFinale
I am really hoping both of them look into the camera and yell ... "PSYCH!" #TheBacheloretteFinale
If I'm falling for this scam right now, then I apologize to all of you for falling for #PhelpsvsShark. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Yeah, everybody hang tight. Something isn't quite adding up. #TheBacheloretteFinale
THAT is not a bad scenario. https://t.co/kjRvcCkftP
On a 3-hour show, you don't end all the suspense after 2 hours. Something ain't adding up right now. #TheBacheloretteFinale
She just clearly said that she hopes he finds what he's looking for.  That's it? The drama of this season is over?! #TheBacheloretteFinale
I think we're being played right now. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Peter looks like he should have a key to the front door of the Playboy Mansion on his key chain. #stylin #TheBacheloretteFinale
Y'all, they're messing with us. And when I say they, I mean my employer..@ABC.  So I guess WE are messing with Y'ALL? #TheBacheloretteFinale
Wait. This is confusing. There's a breakup. They're bringing him out now. But we can't assume she's with Bryan. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Oh, come on. Cut back to the live studio after all that drama. I'm trying to stay in the moment! #TheBacheloretteFinale
Oh Lord, AND it's raining. Just adds to the drama. #TheBacheloretteFinale
We've all been there. At the hotel elevator ... not wanting to say goodbye. #TheBacheloretteFinale
This is just ... awesome.  And real. This is a real couple having a real conversation. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Peter: "U ready 2 spend the rest of ur life w/me?" Rachel: "I can't answer that right now."  Peter: "here's my mic. I'm dropping it now."
Now, I'm hoping she DOESN'T choose Peter just so he can be the next Bachelor. Imagine him up in the head of 25 women! #TheBacheloretteFinale
He is annoyingly reasonable. #TeamPeter #TheBacheloretteFinale
WOW!  Peter is not messing around. He's being as clear as possible. #TheBacheloretteFinale
This is a dude that doesn't seem to be competing on a reality show. He's just dating, &amp; cameras happen to be around. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Damn, Peter. Damn. Damn. DAMN! "I'm not ready to propose to you tomorrow."  #TheBacheloretteFinale
Peter did not close the deal. He is Sigmund Freuding her.  #TheBacheloretteFinale
GREATEST LINE of the season: "Marriage doesn't scare me. Having multiple marriage scares me." -- Peter #TheBacheloretteFinale
She gives Peter strong side eye anytime he talks about marriage.   #TheBacheloretteFinale
This looks so sweet and intimate, but there's a photographer in that hot air balloon with them. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Can we fault the dude for NOT wanting to propose after 6-8 weeks of knowing her on a TV show? #TheBacheloretteFinale
I wasn't feeling Eric earlier in the season. He grew on me, and now, I'm a huge fan. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Beard is a little thicker. Suit is a little more tailored. Eric looking good. Won't get  Rachel, but he has options. #TheBacheloretteFinale
BLACK PANTHER! My, oh my! Y'all see that preview? Black Panther. Black Bachelorette. ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 #TheBacheloretteFinale
Grab all the wine you can on the way to the airport, bruh. You're gonna be alright. #TheBacheloretteFinale #Eric
"I have stronger feelings for the other two guys that are here...." Ouch.  #TheBacheloretteFinale
She shouldn't look pissed off that she gave Peter a rose.  But whatever! #TheBacheloretteFinale @TheRachLindsay
Peter looks like he KNOWS that speech was for him. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Something bizarre about getting a note from Chris Harrison saying, "Y'all wanna hook up tonight?" #TheBacheloretteFinale #nosex
Man, it's hard to hide it when there's somebody else in the picture. #TheBacheloretteFinale
It's just 8:30. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Peter is there ... on her date with Bryan.  #TheBacheloretteFinale  @TheRachLindsay
YET https://t.co/u8eca2GIVw
They even got them interracial horses.  #TheBacheloretteFinale
Oh, dang.  I forgot about Bryan. #TheBacheloretteFinale @TheRachLindsay
"Maybe there will be clarity in the morning."  If I had a nickel 4 every time I said that before going to a hotel... #TheBacheloretteFinale
At this point, I'd take a fantasy suite with Peter. #TheBacheloretteFinale @TheRachLindsay
Peter is going to have to reveal something really crazy about himself for me to get off #TeamPeter. #TheBacheloretteFinale
Y'all.  It's 8:11pm, and this show hasn't really started yet.  #BacheloretteFinale
Did they just air a promo for "Bachelor in Paradise?"  #BacheloretteFinale
Can we come on and start the show, please! #BacheloretteFinale
Wait ... what?  They brought her out to watch the finale with us? @TheRachLindsay #BacheloretteFinale
Why are they trying to make us think Peter is in trouble tonight? #BacheloretteFinale
Announcer: "...where she was falling in love with 3 men."  Ugh. #BacheloretteFinale
You're putting pressure on me to be AMAZING tonight! https://t.co/ZCKoa8bU2F
Hell to the naw naw naw naw naw. https://t.co/rpaYZ2pIjk
If u cry more than twice or pick some1 other than Peter, yes Rachel...I will be HUGELY disappointed. By the way, good luck!  #ridinwithPeter https://t.co/Gl1gblxKBL

They GAVE Idris Elba my room earlier this week. But they put HER down the hall and around the corner from me!? #somebodygettingfired @GMA https://t.co/54d8AIuQk6
You now what ... ask @TheRachLindsay.  She can tell you why I'm watching so closely this season. #greenroomchat @GMA https://t.co/KWnZGniPco
Tuition + room and board at UCF is about $17k per year. He's not making that much on YouTube...yet. https://t.co/Yn0LuQizsK

I'm embarrassed to be a dude right now. #MenTellAll #Thebachelorette @TheRachLindsay
RACs. He just dropped Random Ass Chick on the show.  I thought my boys and I were the only ones who used that. #MenTellAll #TheBachelorette
Do we really have to watch another episode of "The Wrestler and the Racist?" #Mentellall #thebachelorette @TheRachLindsay
I truly can not believe I'm watching this. A show titled: #MenTellAll. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Ugh. https://t.co/T3X4Zn8Kpt
Alright, @TheRachLindsay, you have to make the call for me: should I watch and live tweet this foolishness tonight? #TheBachelorette
Asking what Scaramucci comments Trump found "inappropriate, @HallieJackson says, "The president is no stranger to salty language." #loveher
OK, technically, @halliejackson is the competition. But she just won me over with her question at the WH briefing. #saltylanguage
To explain that WH is not in chaos, @SarahHuckabee says, "come to my house with 3 preschoolers. This does not hold a candle to that."
Huckabee Sanders says the president thought Scaramucci's comments "were inappropriate for a person in that position."
WH briefing underway now. @SarahHuckabee opens it up for questions and reporters shouted: "What happeneded?!?!" #Scaramucci

On AG Sessions keeping his job, Trump says, "We will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell."
Trump: "I want the attorney general to be much tougher on leaks from intelligence agencies."
Trump being asked more specifically now if he wants to keep Jeff Sessions as AG.
Trump: "I am disappointed in the attorney general. He should not have recused himself (from Russia inquiry)" ...
First question to Trump is about AG Jeff Sessions and if he wants him to resign and will he fire him.

We have to see Lee and the wrestler next week on a reunion show but have to wait two weeks for the actual show? #TheBachelorette
How the hell are we gonna have a reunion show before the actual show has ended?! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Peter, I respect that.  He's not just telling her what she wants to hear.  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Engagement doesn't mean marriage to her?  Am I hearing this right? #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Peter is so practical and level-headed ... that he's blowing it. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
This sister is going to get a ring ... from somebody. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"Peter for the win!," says @TheRachLindsay. #TheBachelorette

Wait. What? She gets to offer the guys a "fantasy suite?"  Is the next episode airing on HBO? #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Now they get 2 go 2 Spain! If ur gonna dump me, dump me in Spain. No better place to mend my broken heart. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
The ONLY reason I want her to pick Bryan: I want 2 see the ABC special when he goes home w/her 4 holidays. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Mom is not messing around with the word "love" tonight. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Mom is everything. "Love? Really?! In this short amount of time? I'm uncomfortable with the word 'love' at this point." #TheBachelorette
Sister just nailed it:  "you had an answer for everything." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
What?! Then why didn't ya'll tell us that?! He looked like he was leaving for the airport! https://t.co/otumjqb3w3
Seriously, where did Bryan go? He needed to excuse himself from the table? Where the hell is he?! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Soooo, what time is the next direct flight from DFW to MIA? #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Did he just step out so he could phone a friend?  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Somebody, please!!!! Throw this dude a lifeline!  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Mom is not feeling something already. #Bryan #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay

I'm loving Rachel's sister.  She is not playing around. #TheBachelorette
"I'm siting her talking to Rachel's other boyfriend while her 3rd boyfriend is out meeting her family." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
I'm done. Peter is my guy.  I'm loving this dude right now.  He has finally decided to keep it 💯. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Peter has just won over momma.  He's about to wrap this thing up. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Mom ain't playing around. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Did dude just ask Peter, "for real, she's crazy, right?!" #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Peter is killin' it! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Oh wow ... it's a lot of swirl going on in this family. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
This takes me back:  my sister bringing a white boy home to meet the family. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
2 dudes having a conversation about why another dude isn't in love like they are. My boys and I have never had this talk. #TheBachelorette
This will be settled tonight. They are meeting homegirl's family. Oh yeah, family will settle this for her. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Can you really do that? Fall in love w/THREE at the same time?! She said she's falling in love with Eric, Bryan, &amp; Peter. #TheBachelorette
"Hopefully, when I leave here, I'll be an engaged woman." -- that's how @TheRachLindsay is starting off @#TheBachelorette .

"Passionately," huh? Between the shark, the backlash, @GStephanopoulos, and watching "Jaws" last night, I was worked up! @GMA #PhelpsvsShark https://t.co/d7YbFc0t9q
Me: "U missed it! He lost 2 the shark by 2 secs."  @marileefholmes: (sarcastically) "I don't know how I'm gonna get over it." #PhelpsVsShark
Some science in there, learned a couple of things, and it was a cool challenge. Don't be mad he wasn't eaten. 🦈 #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek
Put that shark in an aquatic center in Tokyo and tell it to swim between the lines, and let's see what's up. #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek
Great white beats Phelps by 2 seconds in the ... "race?" #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
Both of my girls have left the room. Disappointed Phelps isn't side-by-side w/great white.  #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
Time Phelps has to beat: 36.1 seconds in 100 meters. #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
If these guys had been on Amity island, "Jaws" would have ended in about 35 minutes. #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
Your hopes aside ... Discovery would have to shut down if they let a shark take a bite out of the Greatest of All Time! https://t.co/W2u9lFrJP2
Seriously, did any of y'all really think they were putting the greatest Olympian of all time in open water next to a shark? #PhelpsVsShark
1 member of the Holmes family a/b to walk out of the room. Peeved Phelps isn't side-by-side w/shark.  #PhelpsvsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
Man, I hope he decides to go to Tokyo in 2020.  I miss his arm flapping routine before a race. #PhelpsVsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
He's my boy, but sorry, Michael.  For my money, I have to be #TeamShark on this one. #PhelpsvsShark #SharkWeek @Discovery
Phelps top speed: 5.5+ MPH. Great white top speed: 25+ MPH. Good luck, playa.  #SharkWeek #PhelpsVsShark @Discovery

Note the size of the rearview mirror is much smaller than windshield. Don't spend so much time looking back. #SundayService @BishopBronner
If you want to put a new habit in your life, you need to remove an old habit first. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Some of your greatest success lies in your ability to STOP doing something. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Ask: What is it in your life that you need to STOP doing? #SundayService @BishopBronner
We all make a "to-do" list.  But do you have a "stop doing" list? #SundayService @BishopBronner
When we've messed up, we need the help of others to regain our moral equilibrium. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There are plenty of people who are alive but are not awake. Others are awake...but still not aware. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There's someone in ur life right now that u need to love back to life. Now is not the time they need judgment. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Do you know someone that you need to love back to life?  Your testimony qualifies you to do it. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't assume that because you've made mistakes that it should be a permanent thing. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Write your troubles and sorrows in the sand. Carve your blessings in stone. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There are many things you don't want written in stone: your mistakes, sins, etc. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning to you! Hope this #SundayService comes right on time for something in your life. Here we go! @BishopBronner
OJ Simpson will go free on October 1st.  #OJSimpsonParole
OJ dipped his head, was somewhat emotional when board granted parole. Said "thank you" to them. #OJSimpsonParole
OJ Simpson will be getting out of prison. Board votes unanimously to grant parole to Orenthal James Simpson. #OJSimpsonParole
ALL FOUR BOARD MEMBERS HAVE VOTED TO GRANT OJ SIMPSON PAROLE. #OJSimpsonParole
FIRST THREE parole board members have voted to grant OJ Simpson parole.  #OJSimpsonParole
Parole board member: "You organized this crime... no excuse for it. You deserved to go to prison." #OJSimpsonParole
OJ is cracking jokes and laughing prior to board rendering decision. #OJSimpsonParole
This is fascinating. OJ being himself, having a casual conversation with people in the room before the board comes back in. #OJSimpsonParole
OJ Simpson has returned to hearing room. Awaiting the parole board to return with a decision. #OJSimpsonParole
OJ friend, Henry Johnson: OJ is innocent of murder. George: "You don't know that" Johnson: "Yes I do &amp; I'll tell you why" George: "Go ahead"
Henry Johnson, friend of OJ's, just said if Nicole &amp; Ron were "alive today they would tell you that you got the wrong guy." #OJSimpsonParole
Dr. Henry Johnson, a friend of OJ's, just told our @GStephanopoulos: "an innocent man has been persecuted the past 25 yrs." #OJSimpsonParole
The 4 commissioners will deliberate in private and are expected back shortly to vote on whether or not OJ will be paroled. #OJSimpsonParole
Just got in front of a TV in time to see parole board leave to deliberate on whether OJ Simpson will get out of prison. #OJSimpsonParole
My wife would have to take the remote from ME in order to turn away from #TheBachelorette. I'm all in with @TheRachLindsay. https://t.co/HbCzNnHPTG
But then we'd have to go back to Aspen. https://t.co/mZzlrpx1SL
"I'm shocked and confused," said Dean and every man who has every been dumped. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
I'm rooting for Dean in all he does from here on. Seems like a special dude. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
As I was saying ... https://t.co/BMIiSzi2Oj
And Dean can probably thank his family for his roseless night. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Eric can thank his family for that rose. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Mr. Miami stays. She's not crazy. She can get another trip to South Beach. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
The fellas look good tonight. Sharp. One of 'em is dressed for a helluva lonely night out in Dallas. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
That's all it would be anyway! I KNOW nothing. https://t.co/1JlhK2Cs2Z
Want me to tell you? https://t.co/JrYpaZCXFV
Oh my goodness, Dean just looked like a kid waiting on his prom date. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Tonight's Family Rankings:   1) Eric's Family 2) Peter's Family 3) Bryan's Family (Unranked) Dean's Family  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Tonight's Rankings:  1) Peter  2) Bryan 3) Eric 4) Dean   #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Wait. What? Did she just tell Dean, "I'm falling in love with you too?" #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
She is a good woman. @TheRachLindsay is really showing me something right now in being there for this kid. #TheBachelorette
Man, I miss Baltimore. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Is this necessary for us all to see? This is difficult to watch. #TheBachelorette
This really is something. Not fun and dating games. This is real. Family is something. #TheBachelorette
This just became a totally different reality show. #TheBachelorette is now #TheTherapist. @TheRachLindsay
She deserves a lot of credit for being a friend and supportive of Dean through this. Says a lot. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Ya know, you can pick your spouse, but you can't pick your spouse's family. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"My father is a Sikh of some sort." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Even I'm nervous about this. #Deanfam #thebachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Get back on that ATV &amp; ride right out of town. She shouldn't even go to the house. "Dean, it's been real." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
That's pretty cool. Riding ATVs. #thebachelorette @therachlindsay
For any guy who has ever proposed, Peter sounds familiar. Don't want to be rushed or forced. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
If she doesn't pick Peter, he is going to have ever single woman in this country planning trips to Madison. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Wow. The only downside I can see is spending Christmases in a cold Madison. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Uh oh. Peter brought in the niece to close the deal. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
You must still be drinking. 'Cause that sounds like a tweet I would send! https://t.co/yTQuJ2TGe5
Realest thing I've heard on this show: "It's f---ing terrifying," Peter talking about idea of proposing. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Is this the "Peter's not a racist" conversation they're having? #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
I'm just relieved they did a farmer's market. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"I'm falling for Rachel." Not gonna be good enough for @TheRachLindsay, Peter. Better get those words together. #ILoveyou #TheBachelorette
Damn, nobody else got a greeting like that. #Peter #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Eric's family takes Round 1 from Bryan's family... with a near TKO. #BaltimorevsMiami #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Did you respond like a playa?! https://t.co/z42sQcKj2K
is that better, @TheRachLindsay?  Bryan didn't flub the line: "Rachel, I'm in love with you?" Happy now?! #TheBachelorette
How do I say this to @TheRachLindsay: RUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNN! #TheBachelorette
Bryan's mom just made a really practical statement. "All these girls and you fall in love with the girl from the show!?" #TheBachelorette
I'm praying a family member says to her, "So I hear you're dating 3 other guys. What's up with that?" #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
If they take her to play spades in the next hometown, I'm writing a letter to the network. (Oh, it's my network.) https://t.co/mAyQD9tKwK
Eric could sell @TheRachLindsay on his family. Bryan is selling her...on MIAMI. 💃🕺 #TheBachelorette
Basketball in Baltimore. Now dominoes in Miami. Hmmmm... #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Good point. I've been married 7 years, and I'm still figuring out what love means to me!  😂😂😂 https://t.co/9OGnZ5ZEbn
You say it first!  That's how we like to roll. #Iloveyoutoo https://t.co/VipwERHzAv
Come on, @TheRachLindsay! Give the brotha a break. So he flubbed the "I love you" line. We always struggle with that! #TheBachelorette
They are getting lit at Eric's house. I love these folks! 🍷 #TheBachelorette
Eric is making a late charge! Would have had him behind in this race. His fam just changed the game for me. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Why does @TheRachLindsay have a different drink in every scene at Eric's house? Slow down, sista! #TheBachelorette
"A lot of men don't reach for the stars bc they reach for the thing next to them: their mother." Hmmm. #TheBachelorette
This woman is wonderful. Her first question is one of concern for @TheRachLindsay. Good people. #TheBachelorette
That is also the FIRST thing I ever said to @TheRachLindsay.  "Let's talk about race..." #TheBachelorette
This is so familiar.... and cute and cool.  That's family right there! Eric's family is his trump card. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Can you remember the 1st time you took somebody home to meet the family? This episode is bringing up some painful memories! #TheBachelorette
Any chance she's going to play basketball in the hometowns of any of the other guys? #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Show has been on 5 minutes, and I'm liking Eric more than at any other time. Cool to see him at home. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Great start in Baltimore. "This is the nice part of the city." -- Eric #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Look who I ran into last wk. Gave me scoop. Says she's sending all 4 guys home 2nite &amp; going home single! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay https://t.co/IdBRnrTp1S
My pre-segment ritual. #whatyoudontseeonTV @gma #Wimbledon @ ABC Studios https://t.co/1GSGInk9us
And let the twitter church say: AMEN!  I hope something spoke to u today in #SundayService. Looking forward to a great week! @BishopBronner
Right now, you need ANOTHER chance.... because you blew your 2nd chance a long time ago. #Sundayservice @BishopBronner
If you send evil to other people, it always comes back at you. #SundayService @BishopBronner.
You can do wrong, but there is no rest. That's why wicked people look old before they get old. #SundayService @BishopBronner

If you endured the initial blow, then what makes you think you'll die in recovery? You survived for a reason. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Recovering is very possible but it's not easy. Recovery means difficult things ahead. #SundayService @BishopBronner
"Integrity is built by defeating the temptation to be dishonest." #RickWarren #SundayService @BishopBronner

"...do not run with uncertainty (without definite aim)..." #Corinthians #SundayService @BishopBronner
There are so many in the world that don't want you to make it. You're in a fight. Fight the good fight. #sundayService @BishopBronner
It's not just what you're fighting THROUGH, it's what you're fighting to get TO. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You've got to fight through the bad days to get to the good days. #fightthegoodfight #SundayService @BishopBronner
It's a fight to move on in a relationship, to protect your kids, even to get out of bed in the morning, etc. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There is ALWAYS something or someone working against you, making you think you can't succeed. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Every time a negative thought comes, you've got to beat it back. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You've got to fight the good fight. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't fall in to the trap of thinking that your worst is who you really are. That you can't change.. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Busyness is a distration. Distraction leads to deception... and ultimately destruction. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Don't sit in silence when you love somebody. You risk losing a friend bc you tell them the truth in love. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning. I have a short and sweet (and timely) #SundayService for you. Ready to fight the good fight? Here we go. @BishopBronner
Congrats to Garbine Muguruza. I guess. 😒 #Venus #Wimbledon
Of course, I didn't turn it off.  Though, I did mute the TV. I wanted this so bad for her. #Venus #Wimbledon
I might have to stop watching. I'm entirely too stressed about how this is going. #Wimbledon #Venus
Venus drops the 1st set. My heart drops to my stomach. Great 1st set, even if I didn't like the outcome.  Come on, Venus! #Wimbledon2017
----! #break #Wimbledon2017 #Venus
Just the first set, and I'm a nervous wreck! https://t.co/yjhY0bNLcB
Going going for her 1st major title since 2008. Rooting hard for Venus right now. #Wimbledon2017
Thanks! But now I just need (cash) paying customers. My current two customers only pay with love! @marileefholmes #BabySabine #hairbyHolmes https://t.co/dA2lShJa7G
Now, I see why Dean didn't want to take @TheRachLindsay home. #TheBachelorette
Sista looks exhausted.  Poor thing.  Most of us usually only have to dump one person at a time. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
The brotha lives to fight another day!  Eric stays. She's going to Baltimore! #hometowns #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
That's a direct quote from her ... not me! https://t.co/rMDV5yNaU4
"He's 29 and never brought a girl home?!" -- @TheRachLindsay #TheBachelorette
This is how he sells going home to Baltimore? #TheBachelorette
They weren't on dates, so they've been sitting around drinking. That'll do wonders for your confidence! ;-) https://t.co/CMxIA9cQe3
I need a drink. #TheBachelorette
He took the champagne. Good for you! Grab some plates, dude's watch, and anything else you can get your hands on! #TheBachelorette
Well, it was possible. And, Eric is holding on for dear life right now. But that wasn't the point. She's looking for love! https://t.co/4OJLbNlhjk
Oh my. After tonight, there might not be any brothas left...for the 1st black Bachelorette to choose. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Oh, she's reeeeeeally picking a husband?! I thought this was just all fun and games..and cool locales. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Peter ... I need you to keep a little bit to yourself.  I'm not saying lie, but don't unload everything! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Q: "Have you every brought a black girl home before?"  A: "I've never dated a black woman before." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
That's one of the coolest dates I could imagine. #SwissAlps #TheBachelorette
Oh no! Be safe, please!! https://t.co/cOpSxCSmgz
Damn, Dean.  That's heavy. This kid has been through some stuff.   #TheBachelorette
Is Dean's last name Munster?  What the hell is up with his family?! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Since she's not live tweeting, I'll do it for her: "He seems like a sweet kid, though..but he's a KID!!" -- @marileefholmes #TheBachelorette
Damn, Dean. He's crumbling right before our eyes. #TheBachelorette
What in the world is up with Dean's family?!  Now, I don't even want her to go to Aspen. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Other dude got a Breitling. Dean got a Catholic mass. Let us pray for him.  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
First time I've been into this show. Calling it like I see it! #TheBachelorette https://t.co/rRKZoYPvRE
Ooohh, she picked him for a hometown date bc he's from MIAMI. That's it. She just wants to hit the beach. Good call, Rach. #TheBachelorette
Then, you and @marileefholmes need to start a support group. She is not feeling this dude. #TheBachelorette https://t.co/1bqBiCyLez
I make no apologies. #TheBachelorette https://t.co/hnRdSvSS3t
Is the commentary in your house like the commentary in the Holmes house?: "37, in Miami, single, &amp; that smooth?" 🤨 #TheBachelorette
"I don't understand why he is still single."  Most women who have ever uttered that ... #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Byran and @TheRachLindsay should just go ahead and elope.  #TheBachelorette
"I like black," says Bryan, referring to a watch. "You do?!", says the black bachelorette. ;-)  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
She just bought this dude a Breitling watch!  I didn't get one until my 1-year anniversary! Took him a week! #TheBachelorette@TheRachLindsay
If she doesn't pick him, I really hope they let him keep that car. #Bentleyconvertible #TheBachelorette
"I need you guys to trust me," says @TheRachLindsay to the SIX guys she's dating. 😂 #TheBachelorette
Geez.Preview for 2nite's #TheBachelorette had a lot of crying. Not sure I'm ready. I'm already in a fragile emotional state. @TheRachLindsay
And let the twitter church say...Amen! Good to be back. Hope you got a little something out of #SundayService! @BishopBronner
There r things already in u but just need to be shaken up. U don't get sweet until ur shaken a bit. #lemonade #SundayService @BishopBronner

Without loving relationships, you can still be starving, even if you've gotten all the protein you need 2day. #SundayService @BishopBronner
What good is it to have all the food and nourishment in the world ... but have no one to love you? #sundayService @BishopBronner
Physical nourishment is insufficient for a healthy life.  We also have spiritual needs. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Humility is not thinking less of yourself.  It's thinking of yourself LESS. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You don't have the right to criticize my car when I pick you up for a ride when YOU don't have one. #grateful #SundayService @BishopBronner
Some need help but have too much pride to ask &amp; would rather suffer in silence than admit how bad things are. #SundayService @BishopBronner
You can't teach someone a lesson that he or she thinks they already know. #SundayService @BishopBronner #canIgetanAMEN
Some people you meet will be unteachable until they fail. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Humility comes when we realize and acknowledge that we need help. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Failure teaches us humility. Imagine the kind of person you'd be if everything you ever attempted worked. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Lack and failure can be gifts.  They both teach us humility. #SundayService @BishopBronner
There's purpose in everything you go through, even if you can't see it in the moment. #SundayService @BishopBronner
Good Sunday morning! I've been away. My preacher's been away. So missed a few, but now #SundayService is back! Here we go! @BishopBronner
Never heard anything quite like this. Here is my @GMA segment from this morning. Video: US star injury at Wimbledon https://t.co/QK24ETj3FR
Despite my appeals, I don't think my man got the OK to perform "I Don't --- With You" on @GMA. #wakeupcall https://t.co/IDpvkrwWvI
Did you know this was a thing? Video: Is snorting chocolate the latest teen drug?  https://t.co/E0zQ3BYo8c
Teddy Atlas made clear: it's either incompetence or corruption if a judge scored fight 117-111. "No one is that incompetent." #PacquaioHorn
I guess we should be thankful  #MayweatherMcGregor isnt taking place in Ireland. #PacquaioHorn
I don't understand this sport sometimes. Are we all idiots ... or novices and don't know what we're seeing? #PacquiaoHorn
Teddy Atlas is going off. Slamming the table even. "You don't give everybody a trophy for trying hard!" #PacquiaoHorn
What did I miss?!?!? #PacquiaoVsHorn
First season I've ever watched. I'm all in. https://t.co/UAcm9PAzRY
That's hella casting, right?!?!?! https://t.co/Xgjh9ic7CL
You're missing out. https://t.co/C6nyi8Iz4w
Your response just made me giggle. "I think..." :-) https://t.co/QtTT6FTuBB
I'm with you. I "fell" for Rachel too when I met her, and I told her I'd root for her and support the show. 1st season I've EVER watched. https://t.co/PrymmZpa8s
Why should she have to choose a mate just based on race...even if she is the first black Bachelorette? https://t.co/sNmxz5njpW
There YOU go ... :-) https://t.co/4qVsuuPt9e
So much crying on this show moving forward. I didn't sign up for this. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
First thing out of @marileefholmes' mouth when Alex got cut ... "Aww, I liked his hair." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"Take a moment. Say your goodbyes." Chris makes it sound like a funeral. #TheBachelorette
#BabySabine is up an hour past her bedtime because her Daddy is caught up in this foolishness! #TheBachelorette
She likes brothas.  But she might not like some of THESE brothas they gave her to choose from... https://t.co/82BAx3M9DG
You ain't know ... https://t.co/WMRFYRjB2C
Eric is staying. She liked that date a lot. @TheRachLindsay #TheBachelorette https://t.co/xPiAOms9Wf
You ain't ever lied ... https://t.co/vuUO90LpuV
And then there was .... ONE. https://t.co/IngthqE4xH
Brothas are dropping like flies! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Will is going to be a contestant on the next season of the Bachelorette. 👱‍♀️
My wife just got up and made herself a drink after that "race" conversation,. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
She seemed really thrown when he said he's mainly dated white women. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"Typically or only" dated white women? @TheRachLindsay is not playing. #TheBachelorette
2nd option? I wouldn't go that far, right? He has different experiences. https://t.co/HDsr2gBB9y
He didn't say he was against dating black women.  Just hasn't been his typical experience. Right? There's hope! https://t.co/VTuWE299Vh
OK. That's funny.  BUT ... the bruh likes what he likes. He didn't say he's NEVER dated black women. So, he's open. Right? https://t.co/PGeGMEWxrd
I'm kinda rooting for Will. Seems like a nice guy. But he needs a 2016 @Cavs comeback right now! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Uh oh.....  Things aren't looking great for Will. Damn, I guess he really isn't into black women.  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
This is the first season I've ever watched #TheBachelorette/#TheBachelor ... and it's only because of my girl, Rachel. https://t.co/ppvDvxAlCl
Kind of crazy.  You take me out to a brewery, and THEN I tell you...."I don't drink beer." https://t.co/c7OtSFlN24
That's a sweet, grown-up goodbye. "If my daughter grew up to be like Rachel, then I know I did a good job." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
There was some yelling here too. But what were YOU yelling? https://t.co/tpbwwZd0YB
Not knocking the bruh for his preferences. But, she's the FIRST BLACK BACHELORETTE! https://t.co/UMpjCXQ0W9
Say whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?!? https://t.co/CVLo6OnNPC
Exactly WHAT was going on in your mind? https://t.co/c7rGuaACCt
The 1st black Bachelorette &amp; 1 of her options is a black guy who doesn't date black women. Oh, the irony. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"I typically date white girls." The Holmes house just erupted. #TheBachelorette@TheRachelLindsay
"My family is very open ..." Ay yay yay. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
They bled for this woman. That's more than I've ever done for @marileefholmes. We've been married 7 years! #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
OK, Babyface.  Calm down. :-) https://t.co/lN8zR17Ets
"Viking Magazine Man of the Month."  That's the most endearing thing I've heard from Kenny. #TheBachelorette
That's an excellent point.  Burger went untouched. https://t.co/KfbtZc9uoa
I am calling in sick when @TheRachLindsay comes back to @GMA. She can make 30 dudes "fall in love" in 30 minutes?! #TheBachelorette
Burgers and champagne.  Can't beat that on a date. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
He said he wanted to have 10 kids.  She looked like she wanted to throw him off that boat. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
One of the best calls yet:  cutting Josiah. I appreciate arrogance ... but damn.  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Where I would be in life if I went through my entire dating life like that: I don't see you as my spouse. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Who is dressing this sista?!?!  Good lord!  Good job.  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"You want to watch something where there's not so much kissing?" -- Daddy "Yes, that would be lovely." -- #BabySabine #TheBachelorette
"She can be the wife. And he can be the husband. They were kissing." -- #BabySabine #Holmeshousecommentary #TheBachelorette
"That's a lot of kissing.  A lot of lips..." -- @marileefholmes  #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
"I have a very long fuse. But if it goes off, it goes off."  Goodnight, Kenny. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
My apologies to @DonnieWalberg for ever making fun of him for his #TheBachelorette/#TheBachelor addiction. @GMA @TheRachLindsay
OK, @TheRachLindsay ... please tell me you ended up sending both of these dudes home.  #TheBachelorette
#LeevKenny &gt; #McGregorMayweather. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
It's 8:03. I already need to send #BabySabine out of the room. #bleep #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
I'm not even live tweeting from my iPhone tonight.  I'm doing this from my home PC.  It's that deep. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
When Lee and Kenny are involved, the show becomes "Survivor: Rachel's Heart." #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Lee and Kenny should get their own reality show after this. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Who goes ... Lee or Kenny? #TheBachelorette
Rachel is going to get a Listerine endorsement after this. #makeoutqueen #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Rachel is playing chess. #TheBachelorette
Let me be clear: I am the one driving this in the Holmes house. https://t.co/4qm3107IF6
Why is homeboy wearing his jockstrap on the outside? #handball #TheBachelorette
Not the case, my man. https://t.co/ZPAxHurXta
Rachel!!! What was the FIRST thing I said to you at @GMA!!! https://t.co/DxqaSpNntb
They're setting us up w/this dude. Mr. Too Good To Be True. @marileefholmes thinks he's married. Ha! #Brian #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
There it is. One of the brothas suggests @TheRachLindsay has a problem with brothas. Rachel! #TheBachelorette
I forget. We need the ratings. Can't end the show so quickly. https://t.co/Wehmoy0n1u
My word, @marileefholmes has gone stalker on us. She is googling @TheRachLindsay's potential mates. #TheBachelorette
So, Brian should go ahead and propose and we can wrap this thing up, right? #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
That was brilliant. No one on the crew knew what a "1-8-7" was. #TheBachelorette
Wipe your face, bruh.  #TheBachlorette
Dang, she is sending dudes home looking like that!?  That's cold, @TheRachLindsay. #whatyouremissing #TheBachelorette
Well, at least she walked him out. #Jack #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Even I'm bored on this date. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
I swear I'm waiting on @TheRachLindsay to tell Jack, "I'm just not that into you." #TheBachelorette
Thank you, Will. #TheBachelorette
We thought we had a new favorite. But ..... #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
A 100% true, verbatim statement from @marileefholmes: "Too bad you're married. You'd be great on this show" #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
Damn, I gotta send #BabySabine out of the room for this episode of #TheBachelorette. @TheRachLindsay
"An unrealistic violent aspect to you?"  OK, I even took offense to that. #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
#BabySabine: "Is he in love?" @marileefholmes: "He thinks he is." #HolmesHousecommentary #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
It's IMPOSSIBLE to watch this show with my wife. "Oooohhhh, he's a cutie." @marileefholmes #TheBachelorette @TheRachLindsay
#BabySabine's bath time was moved up. Dinner was simplified. And momma came home early. Why? #TheBachelorette is on tonight. I'm ashamed.
Dude, they're moving me around like I'm Dwight Howard! https://t.co/w1ouErJfz2
@pilot @Delta Plane is the same. Seat layout hasn't changed. Was upgraded to a "better" seat but now just randomly being moved.
@KeyaGrant @Delta Sista ... it's driving me crazy.
@Delta Hello, is there a way to prevent Delta from automatically changing my seat? I checked in &amp; chose specific seat but keep getting moved
This is the kind of stuff that goes down when I'm on the road. I should hurry back.… https://t.co/o5jLT6OmHp

For the first time in 43 years, the Bay Area is getting to celebrate a championship at home. #NBAFinals
We should all try to guard LeBron for one possession. Just to see what it's like. #NBAFinals
LeBron is talking ... a lot! To anybody who will listen. Namely, KD and Draymond. #NBAFinals
Up by 15. A half away from winning NBA championship. Sure ... let's fight! #NBAFinals #DavidWest
Body language on the Warriors right now ... #NBAFinals
After one quarter, would you say I should book a flight to Cleveland or not? #NBAFinals
These folks are a little anxious at the Q. And the 1st quarter isn't even over. Chants of "ref, you suck!" are breaking out. #NBAFinals
See! That right there is what fuels conspiracy theories! That phantom foul. #nbafinals
I absolutely LOVE that they have my man @andreward doing the pregame hype video for the @warriors. #nbafinals https://t.co/BdNtSWapXu

The @cavs are shooting 60% from 3. Already at 120 points. Game 5?  #NBAFinals

This is a bizarre and increasingly testy game. There's a lot of shenanigans in the arena. #NBAFinals
Bye bye, Zaza.  #NBAFinals
The earlier tech was on Kerr. Home fans are sorely disappointed. They had already played "hit the road Jack" for Draymond. #NBAFinals
They announced his ejection ... but Draymond is still on the floor. #NBAFinals
You have got to be kidding me. Draymond Green is out with his second technical. #NBAFinals
Not sure what that was about .. but that was some serious in-your-face jawwin' by LeBron and KD. #NBAFinals
:45 into the second half...and a timeout by the Cavs. Coach is not taking any chances. #NBAFinals
Dahntay Jones is still in his warmups but has found a way to enter the game. #technicalfoul #NBAFinals
Ok, so the ref missed one. Just ONE. #backcourt #NBAFinals
Well, that's one way to beat the Warriors: score 200 points..which is what the @Cavs are on pace to do tonight. #NBAFinals
Shumpert, that was hilarious. #NBAFinals
They seem just as live as ever here at @TheQArena! #NBAFinals #Game4 https://t.co/EBWpLw8OEc

Sen. Wyden: "I believe the timing of your firing stinks." #ComeyHearings

Comey says Trump "repeatedly told me I was doing a good job and that I should stay." #ComeyHearing
In opening statement, Comey says the Trump administration "defamed me and the FBI...those were lies plain and simple." #ComeyHearing
