@BCakaTheMan you must be joking @deblasioNYC is the one blocking for rich taxi fleet owners who treat drivers like indentured servants. u 2?
@TaxiTim if the issue is congestion reduce taxis that wander around inefficiently empty, not efficient systems that matches supply to demand
@TaxiTim the proposal to cap drive for hire permits clearly designed to suppress growth of @Uber_NYC &amp; @lyft, a preferential model 4 drivers
couldn't agree more. Ban taxi cartels, not @Uber_NYC  https://t.co/pHj56Hcqeg

@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC the bill you're considering to block @Uber_NYC is backed by taxi fleet owners not drivers or residents. NY knows it
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC find one single @Uber_NYC driver who would go back to driving taxi You can't. You're defending taxi fleet slumlords
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC no New Yorker prefers taxi model 2 @Uber_NYC but you move to constrict positive change bc taxi fleets give $$ SHAME
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC 4 out 5 cab rides I'm in the driver is on phone, speeding &amp; rude if you ask them to stop. We all know this.
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC taxi fleet owners inflict crappy economics for drivers who then inflict horrible service &amp; poor safety on riders
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC you're fighting for an industry that creates abusive indentured servitude for its drivers, gives them no equity
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC no NY Taxi offers a car pool option to reduce traffic. no NY Taxi offers recourse when a driver is on their phone
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC who would defend utterly horrendous service &amp; moribund biz model of NY Taxis against good service &amp; efficiency?
@NYCCouncil is considering a bill that threatens to destroy 10,000 NYC job opportunities. @deBlasioNYC, oppose ban on new @Uber_NYC cars

I would like to meet Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda. Check out "A Thousand Hills" by Stephen Kinzer.  Incredible story.
Great book about him by Tracy Kidder called "Mountains Beyond Mountains". Hugely inspiring.  Won the Pulitzer Prize.
I admire Dr. Paul Farmer very much. Founded the amazing org Partners in Health.  I support their work in Rwanda - www.pih.org
Adrianne Wonnocott asked "Who do you admire and/or would you like to meet?"
Great question, Doris. I haven't really had to drop trou much.  Easy or hard  not about age, more about who's in the scene with you :)
Doris Bailey asked: "Is it getting easier or harder to shed your drawers on camera as you hit 40?"
Love the place. Inspired by the people. Organization's in startup phase so the help I can offer has bigger impact.  Thanks, Gaile.

wondered how anything was left alone in NY long enough to go wild. read about Friends of High Line. called them.
I lived in the building on the block between Horatio St and Gansevoort. from the roof we'd look down at this ribbon of wildflowers, grasses
Very happy about the way it turned out. exceeded my hopes. made 10 years of effort actually feel worth it.
The High Line is a new park in NYC built on an abandoned, elevated freight rail line.  http://www.thehighline.org/
Linda Schiavello asked about the High Line and how I got involved.

Lot of good, interesting (and funny) questions feeding back from this growing network. would love to respond to all. Hard while working

As I get the hang of this we'll figure out how to make it fun and as interactive as possible and get questions answered when possible
Seems some wondering if a donation is "total" or "per mile" Definitely total!  Not x26 miles :)  Whatever you can manage, many many thanks
Unfortunately I can't get through all responses bc there are so many. Our team is hunting for key questions and emailing me though.
Somebody just gave me Haruki Murakami's book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running".  Says it's great.

Goal of this Twitter experiment is to see if it actually converts into actions. If all this networking gets nothing done what's it for?

15 miles in Central Park. Much better than my last 15.  Got serious about water and Gu and it made a difference.
Ran last night. Cooler. Less crowded. 5 miles. 7:47 average. Last mile 7:24.
Took a day to do cross training on a bike. Pro at Jackrabbit told me that it helps with knee and shin aches.
NYC.  Back on the flats.  Experiencing a lot of pain in lower shins lately.  6 miles
Full disclosure at the start:  I don't Twitter.  Don't read them, have never posted. So I might not be any good at this.
This will be mostly a chronicle of training for the NY marathon. It ends Nov 1 after the race. It probably won't be every day.
I'll try to enliven it with odds and ends and referrals so that it has something for the non-runner.
Mostly, this will be a running diary.  About running, that is. It spreads over seven countries so far.
The main reason for doing this, on all levels, is to raise money for an outstanding conservation effort that I'm involved with.
Check it out.  Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust.  http://www.maasaitrust.org/
I've put together a team of runners.  We're all raising money by running.  Check out our site: www.maasaimarathon.com
Three Maasai guys from Kenya who I work with are coming over to run with us.  Two of them have never traveled more than 200 miles from home.
It seems to me the best thing that these kinds of networks do is give us power to link up with each other and make things happen.
If you like what we're trying to do here and you can contribute anything at all, please do.  Many many thanks.
Pass it on to like-minded people and spread it around. maybe we can collectively achieve something that none of us can do alone.
