Believe that https://t.co/hJOBrqJcD6
@danrafaelespn have u r felt the same. Work your life for something and get hate and love at the same time. What's more important?
To much is given much is required remember that.... So be careful what u pray for
Shit gets heavy sometimes I was always told to just get of your knees and pray. But some just take the easy way out.
Always being so strong for everybody but who's there to see if your ok
Sometimes life gets overwhelming.... The roller coaster of life is something that u can't prepare for it can either kill u or make u strong

Love me or hate me. But my passion to make history isn't just for me but for US... ✊🏾
I fight like a dog so i won't ever have to see the pain my parents had to go through to provide for us every single day...
We grew up with nothing but love we had for each other.....
My family is everything I believe in
I fight for the people close to me. It doesn't matter about me. I sacrifice for the ultimate goal which is US...
It all starts with a vision, and having your whole team seeing that same vision.. Believe it's rough beating men that believe in something..
I don't go into anything to lose, that's just a fact. I never lace up my gloves to go lose.

Look like @AdrienBroner got under Porters dad skin at the press conference today
I just watched the press conference. What are you'll thoughts in the Broner vs Porter fight?
Whatever the move is for the next fight whoever it is, its gonna be exciting.. 😎
But we'll see what happens but stop jumping the gun.. Floyd does what he wants when he wants. He has a lot of options on the table so do we
He is a great fighter but he balls his fist up just like I do. I DONT CARE about anything else lock in with me.. U gonna have to see me.
And understand something u guys should already know me. I don't step in the ring just for a good pay day DAMN THAT!! I have to much pride
But I made it through.. Iam older, Iam wiser, Iam hungrier it may be my time. If it happens coo if not we're good man gonna keep it pushing
Some say this fight should of happened a long time ago before the Ortiz fight... But God put me through a serious roller coaster smh
Been getting a lot of calls about this Mayweather interview. Understand something people don't believe or run with any until the ink dries

Rumble Johnson has never been in this type of situation before. He's cut and bleeding and has a man in front of him pushing him.#UFC187
Right now we're gonna see what Rumble Johnson is about. #UFC187 @ufc
Now DC is where he needs to be smoothing Johnson on the ground. He has to smoother that power. DC is gonna test this kid gas tank #UFC187
Lol lol ooooh shit.. Rumble Johnson is to damn strong bro. DC needs to stop exchanging with him. #UFC187

@Anthonydirrell @VanesBoxing ooo classic!! I see you
B-Hop is a legend much much respect will go down as one of the best to do it
“@FuckArianaaa: @AndreBerto do you think BHop is going to retire?”&gt;&gt;&gt; naw
“@TheRealC_Portis: ..@AndreBerto alienate him from boxing 😂😂😂😂😂😂”&gt;&gt; lol U stupid.. Yea it might be that time for Bhop to chill
“@TheRealC_Portis: ...@AndreBerto man call your boy &amp; tell him to R E T I R E!”&gt;&gt; mannnn smh he's a alien man
Bhop the roughest old man I ever seen smh
“@jermainedupri: Damn!! Hopkins”&gt;&gt; mannn smh
Damn!!!!! Smh woooow  B-Hop is a tough ass old man smh wooooow #ALIENvsKRUSHER
Noooooo Bhop
Oh shit he trying to kill him!!!! Noooo
Last Round!!!! Come on Bhop
Ok last round next sooo tell me what Bhop has to do to win this????  Or there is no chance and he has to jump in his space ship and jet out?
“@RavishingRellz: @AndreBerto B-Hop knew he was 50 When he signed up for the fight tho...Still Salute”&gt;&gt; lol lol
“@darren1992cory: @AndreBerto to be fair hopkins has a alien chin 👽”€&gt;&gt; definitely
These people better stop booing. Shit Bhop is trying to make it home to his great grand kids..
Kov is just to big and strong but he's very technical sound
“@Bannister_90: @AndreBerto How did he stay up there Andre?!”&gt;&gt; I don't know that was a big shot
Wowwww man Bhop keep those hands up brother that was a tough right hand
@danrafaelespn come on the man is 50 years old and in there with a young killer
“@HoutanHaghighat: @AndreBerto The man is 49 years old. Respect. #ALIENvsKRUSHER”&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing but respect
Kov just looks like he's beating on a old man.. B-Hop is banking on Kov slowing down in the late rounds.. U can't count Bhop out
Kovalev is doing a masterful job use this distance with jabs to the should and body....#HopkinsKovalev
“@CDod14: @AndreBerto Who do you have winning Andre?”&gt;&gt; Krusher
“@GregReaves44: @AndreBerto why does Hopkins look so much smaller than Kovalev”&gt;&gt; I was thinking the same
Yea this kid might be alittle to much for Bhop tonight.. Bhop isn't throwing punches he's very defense
“@Run_Ed_Run: @AndreBerto We're gonna see BHop bust out every trick in the book, tonight.”&gt;&gt; he's gonna have to
Bhop's offense is very low because he wants to stay protected this kid has very very heavy hands
Woooow this kid is strong and composed picking his shocks... I think BHop just found out he's in with a different animal
Wowwwwww
“@Gmoneygio: @AndreBerto bro you need to finish ortiz career real talk bro”&gt;&gt; yea that's gonna happen
B hop is gonna use every bit of this ring
Who do u got tonight?
The kid is younger and stronger but B-Hop is on another planet
The Alien!!!!!!!
Here it goes it's fight time B-Hop lets go
I think Bhop is gonna be to smart
We do not sow, we are iron born we're not subjects we are not slaves we do not plow the fields or toy U in the minds we take what is ours
B-Hop said he's a damn Alien.....
Game of thrones
Once dead may never die
I feel Bhop will make history tonight

Favor determines your rewards
A best friend is who speaks to the King in u when the fool in u is acting up
Understand the proof of love is the passion to protect...
They ask Who do u know to whom your assigned? Who's pain do u feel? Who's tears affect U? Who do u want to protect?
Your aways assigned to a thing or a person
Build your wisdom and your life around your assignment
I would be dead by now if I didn't have my faith

Ok Iam out back on the grind sept 6th around the corner
He swings these big shots in between of exchanges and ducks his heads almost looking away from his opponent. It's crazy but it works 4 him
I want to see Danny against Lamont Peterson. I think that would be a hell of a fight. What u think @SHOsports
Yea it was definitely a mismatch but we've seen @DannySwift catch some of the top fighters with those same counter shots @SHOsports
“@PierreGarcon: Lets get it big dog @AndreBerto @SHOsports”&gt;&gt; u already know big bra. Happy belated G day by the way
@DannySwift is very effective with his counters man. Some people see them as wide swinging B.S. but it's a method to the madness @SHOsports
Oh well Danny Garica went in there and did what he had to do. CONGRATS @SHOsports
“@cthagod: This fight was really a waste of time for Danny Garcia. Salka looks like a soccer player not a boxer.”&gt;&gt;lol
Ooooooooh shit!!!!! @SHOsports
Danny is way to strong for this kid @SHOsports
Lol lol my boy rocking the mask tonight @SHOsports
Congrats to my boy Lamont Peterson good awsome win @SHOsports
Lamont Peterson is digging to the body something crazy.... @SHOsports
