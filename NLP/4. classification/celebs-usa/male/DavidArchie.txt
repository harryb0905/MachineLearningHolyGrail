Surprise! ☃️ Since there's only one week left until my new Christmas album is here, I thought I'd share a behind-the-scenes look at how my music video for #ChristmasEveryDay came together. We had a blast filming it! Watch it here: https://t.co/uhai9H4mKU. #FBF #WinterInTheAir https://t.co/2tJx0wQCyx
It was great chatting with you Mehnaz! #WinterInTheAir https://t.co/miidPiDRK9
Just added some Christmas cheer to my @GIPHY profile page with GIFs from my new music video for #ChristmasEveryDay! https://t.co/FO5XzW9P9p https://t.co/czmykOIasW
Not only is it one of my favorite love songs, but one of my favorite songs to cover too. I just love its soothing melody! #DavidArchieMusicFacts
At the end of my time I did an album, especially for the fans there, as it was all music by Filipino artists. "Forevermore" being  one of them.
"Forevermore" is a Filipino song by Side A that I covered in 2012. That year I spent 6 weeks in the Philippines recording the mini-series “Nandito Ako.” https://t.co/U2jpIhgwxx
Thank you @AppleMusic for featuring #ChristmasEveryDay to your Holiday Pop Hits playlist! 🎶🎄🎶 https://t.co/D69dbSHGwC https://t.co/Cg67eRo6i6
For those that might've missed it, I just released my brand new music video for #ChristmasEveryDay! This song is the first single off of my upcoming holiday album, #WinterInTheAir, available everywhere on 11/2! You can watch it right now on @YouTube here: https://t.co/qVPpJYpIok https://t.co/cid1mZSZ4n
It's never too early for a little Christmas cheer... right? 😉 If you agree, you can watch my new music video for "Christmas Every Day" premiering on @etnow! I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did filming it! 🎄🎅🏻 https://t.co/QLHUfbANMj #ChristmasEveryDay #WinterInTheAir
1 year ago I released this album, Postcards in the Sky. This one means soooo much to me! My goal was to be authentic and more vulnerable, telling my story fighting myself forward. I’m so happy with what came out of it. Which song did you relate with most, and why? https://t.co/uJV1UzGZ7b
Monday my new music video for “Christmas Every Day” premieres on ET online! I know it’s not quite even Halloween yet, but I guess you can look at it like a fastpass into the Christmas season. 🤓🎄if that intrigues you at all then check back in Monday! :) https://t.co/SjukgxQzLa

There were a lot of battles I had to fight as an 18-20 year-old. How I found my way through them is on this album like little post-it notes that reminded me to keep perspective and look ahead. #DavidArchieMusicFacts
I realized that who I was and my purpose didn’t come just from becoming famous. I needed  to take time to find who I really was. The album this song is from means a lot to me because it was a challenging time of life for me.
We continued to write “Who I Am” about disconnecting from the  craziness of keeping up with the public image as an artist, and connecting with God and with myself.
I told a few people including the people I worked with and I tried going before I made this 2nd album, but had a contract to still do another album with my record label. I talked to Shelly Peiken about it and she said “I think you should do it.”
I wrote “Who I Am” for my 2nd album “The Other Side of Down” with Mike Krompass and Shelly Peiken. It was the first hint I gave to my fans that I was planning to go on my 2-year mission. #DavidArchieMusicFacts https://t.co/Dw5hX9WMhH
Nine years ago today I released my very first holiday album 'Christmas From The Heart'. Can y’all believe it!? 🎄🎶 This anniversary comes just in time ahead of the release of my upcoming Christmas album, 'Winter In The Air’, which will be out in a few weeks on November 2nd! https://t.co/pnEQAZjzl0

Hope you guys enjoyed that fun little tidbit about "Touch My Hand". Keep an eye out for more fun facts in the future! You can also guess which song you think will be featured next by using the hashtag #DavidArchieMusicFacts.
I recorded this song in a home studio in Oklahoma while I was on the American Idol tour and had a day off there in Oklahoma City. A sweet Oklahoman couple owned it and it was literally a living room feel in their home. 🏡🎶
A fun little fact, Steve Kipner told me after they heard me talking about wanting to connect with the audience but worried about not knowing what the song was about so they wrote a lyric specifically to that moment “I never knew what this song was about but suddenly now I do.”
"Touch My Hand" was written by Steve Kipner, Steve McEwan &amp; Wayne Wilkins!
With my new Christmas album coming out next month, I though it'd be fun to highlight some songs from my previous albums with fun facts about them! To kick it off, I wanted to start with a song from my debut album "Touch My Hand". How many of y'all remember this one? https://t.co/1RhysAK0DA

@suttygal 😂 you know it!
@archftw Haha!  Didn’t think of it. Even if I tried and it worked I probably wouldn’t have learned my lesson. Just being honest. It stings but the sting got me to act and do something. Maybe it was a Godsend to prepare me for a moment where I needed to be more prepared than I would’ve.
All right... I learned my lesson and have 2 phone holders on the way just in case one doesn’t work!  Thanks for the suggestions of the different types y’all!! #youliveyoulearn https://t.co/giTwjGO7ZN
@dannygokey Yeah man. :( going to get a phone holder this evening. Lesson learned!
@kalikakes96 Yeah, I had a phone holder but it kept falling off!  I’ll just have to get another kind. Lol.
Careful following the #GPS on your phone while driving if you’re holding it in your hand y’all. Apparently you can get a $260 citation for distracted driving like I just did! 😩😩😪
10 years later, and I'm still asking if it's real or just another crush... 🤔 Here's a stripped-down version in honor of #10YearsofCrush. https://t.co/QZKLkmZaUM
#RipArethaFranklin   https://t.co/KokK2emeLt
Wow... farewell #QueenOfSoul.  Your songs and voice have forever changed the course of music and singers.   #riparetha https://t.co/iK1FsBEv7z
Those are all the "Crush" facts for today! Hope y'all enjoyed them. We still have a few fun things planned for the rest of the week so make sure you keep your 👀's peeled on my socials. #10YearsofCrush
Fact #4: Pop music with rhythm wasn't something I was familiar with so I'm proud with how the song turned out and it makes me happy to know y'all enjoy it still - even 10 years later. #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/M85OUb4dvz
Fact #3: Debunking those lyric questions... 🤔 it's "is it real or just another crush" NOT "is it really just another crush". Hope this answers any confusion you may have had over the past decade! 😂 #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/42UqP5aWNS
@JordinSparks 😮 https://t.co/dw5ks5l9FC
Fact #2: The song was co-written by three incredible writers @jesscatesmusic, @hodgesmusic, and @EmanuelKiriakou. I'm so thankful for their amazing talents because without them the song would have not existed! #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/Ke4nu2gP99
@elvisduran @FODFansofDavid @ElvisDuranShow @Z100NewYork Thank you for debuting my first ever single!!!
@EmanuelKiriakou @nuts4sweets @KaleiLuvsHawaii @jesscatesmusic @hodgesmusic ❤️
@EmanuelKiriakou @KaleiLuvsHawaii @jesscatesmusic @hodgesmusic 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼😃
Fact #1: The first time I ever heard "Crush" on the radio was when it premiered in NYC on the @ElvisDuranShow on @Z100NewYork! I had a bundle of emotions that day... I was nervous and excited all at the same time! #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/w7uvChWJut
As we continue to celebrate #10YearsofCrush, I'm going to be sharing some fun facts about the song throughout the day...
Thanks for all the questions! That was a fun trip down memory lane! 😃 I've got more things lined up to celebrate #10YearsofCrush the next couple of days. Stay tuned...! :)
@justintygr I can’t help but look out at the crowd and see everyone’s faces as they sing along to it dancing, smiling and shouting “GOIN’ AWAAAYAAAYAAAYAAYAAAY!!!” Makes me feel grateful how a song has become a part of their music listening experience and history. thanks! #10YearsOfCrush
@BarbzzK Yes!  Not only would I but I will! Hope to see you again next time I go!  :) #10YearsOfCrush
@mcolemann Hm... Just Crush. Haha. Can’t see it any other way. #10YearsOfCrush
@lisabillingsley I don’t remember. Some of my aunts and my mom were trying to get my cousin Vanessa to be the love interest so she could be in it. I was like.... serious?? Do you realize what the love interest is supposed to be??  Lolololol 😂 #10YearsOfCrush
@kattygenial It’s an amazing feeling!  Y fue un placer conocerte en Lima! Hasta la próxima vez! :) #10YearsOfCrush
@brianna_coe02 ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ♥️ ♥️ ❤️  ♥️ I can’t thank all y’all enough for simply continuing to enjoy the music!! 🙏🏼 🙏🏼
@Shell_eeeyyy Congrats Veronica! 🎊🎈 #10YearsOfCrush
@Whatawriter I always thought “Don’t Run Away” had a similar drum rhythm. But otherwise I don’t think so. 🤔 #10YearsOfCrush
@curlsandcocoa Hm... @JordinSparks or @torikelly but I think I’d look for any excuse to sing with them. Haha #10YearsOfCrush
@Ktina702 Probably the favorite crush lyric I mentioned earlier. #10YearsOfCrush
@iChooseMayWard Just dandy! How about you? #10YearsOfCrush
@AndreaFOD The same one I auditioned with then. “I’ll Be” if something else I’d choose “Perfect” by @edsheeran
@archieangeltx Pretty much my whole #PostcardsInTheSky album was personal for me. “Aiming for Hope” “Upset With Me” “Waiting in the Stars” “Up All Night” And “Numb” Lol.
@LangoneLady Probably #Numb. #10YearsOfCrush
@ds1no Thank you! :) #10YearsOfCrush
@roxfox01 I think so. I can’t remember well. Maybe “Angels” by @robbiewilliams #10YearsOfCrush
@LangoneLady Nervous. Nervous. Nervous. #10YearsOfCrush
@rhiminee It was really hard at first. Now I sing it so much I think I could sing it in my sleep and could even think about what I’m going to eat for dinner or what’s the next #SuperSmashBrosUltimate character they’re going to reveal or something. Hehe  #10YearsOfCrush
@zelle13 Yep. #10YearsOfCrush #10moreyearsofcrush lol
@beccagriffith For the first couple of years I’d change leave. I felt embarrassed with attention and hearing myself. Now I feel a little awkward at first and then get over it and sing along. 😂 #10YearsOfCrush
@TheMChisme Hold on tight and fasten your seatbelt. #10YearsOfCrush
@sunnysidefox Happy birthday tomorrow 🎂 we’re both celebrating this week! #10YearsOfCrush

@KaleiLuvsHawaii @jesscatesmusic @hodgesmusic @EmanuelKiriakou #10YearsOfCrush :)
@KaleiLuvsHawaii That’d be a question for @jesscatesmusic , @hodgesmusic and @EmanuelKiriakou .  Do you guys remember?
@HerryNelson34 Thanks!! :) #10YearsOfCrush
@suttygal Barbra Streisand #10YearsOfCrush
@leijazel Yes. From its place it has had in my career, how it connects to people, and to me personally... it has taken on a lot more meaning. :)   #10YearsOfCrush
@pabuckie 🎄
@fa3ryg1rl I’m not as afraid to throw out my ideas. I was afraid everyone would say “oh, that’s terrible.  What does this kid think he’s doing?!” @joywilliams taught me an important thing about writing and I still hear her in my head during writes saying “Dare to suck” #10YearsOfCrush
@MelancholicSong Yes. A lot. I didn’t really have friends almost all of elementary and middle school so I became friends with the teachers. It actually was a lot of help to have one-on-one time to talk to them. They helped me know I was heard. #10YearsOfCrush
@iteachkidz22 Oh heck. I have no idea. Hundreds... maybe a thousand times? 🤷‍♂️ #10YearsOfCrush
@KaTiECaT1991 It took a whole day. We started before sunrise and ended around sunset I think. We needed sunlight for the video shoot and cameras. ☀️ #10YearsOfCrush
@camilasjonas Hm, probably when I went to @billboard ‘s website and saw with my own eyes that “Crush” was charted #2 on the Hot 100. I had always watched the charts growing up and it was weird to be on there suddenly. #10YearsOfCrush
@musicislife90 I’ve actually never gotten tired of singing It!  It’s always a lot of fun to sing especially how much the fans enjoy singing along to it. #10YearsOfCrush
@MidNiteSky13 I’ve always liked “Touch My Hand” and “Running” a lot. :) #10YearsOfCrush
@EL_FOD I was completely shocked. Couldn’t believe when they told me it debuted at 2 in the Hot 100. Grateful for @jesscatesmusic @hodgesmusic and @EmanuelKiriakou for writing such a great song. #10YearsOfCrush
😯 Are you holding back like the way I do? 😉 #10YearsOfCrush https://t.co/iODV9yCKki
I was breathing so hard my face was going numb and tingling. 😂 it’s pretty exhilarating hearing your song on the radio for the first time! #10YearsOfCrush https://t.co/9Eyp0y1gXG
@dreamerjb01 Yes!  It was a lot of fun and I had my family all there because it was my first time shooting my own music video.  #10YearofCrush

Ten years ago, I released my first single "Crush" and from that day on it changed my life forever. I can't believe how fast a decade flies by! I do know one thing... and it's that this memory ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayyyy. #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/jwNe9WnCDf

Thus I am sock shopping ONCE AGAIN for the I-don’t-know-how-manyeth time this year alone. 🧦
Do socks vaporize in the washer and dryer or something when they see another like them?  I have a bag of socks whose pairs I still am holding onto the hope of being found for some reason even though some of them I’ve hopelessly held onto for 2 years now. 🤷‍♂️
@sleepingatlast The second it hits the lyrics “I want to believe, No, I choose to believe, that I was made to become a sanctuary” oh man... just moves me. 👌🏼🙏🏼
@sleepingatlast Oh my goodness. 🙈 haha thanks so much for letting me and being kind enough to put them in!
@sleepingatlast Yeah man! 🙌🏼

@passwrdtaken I need to be more like you.
@Palrice8 Mission accomplished. 😏
@dancerbay17 I haven't heard anything from my booking agent. You realize you need to negotiate with agents, right? 😉
@GabrielConte @irnyirdina Haha! Impressive! 👌🏼
@pastelpastel 🎶 conjunction junction, what's your function? 🎶
And don't ask me if I still know every word to the theme song. 😬 #90skid
Every now and then I say "tanky tanky" instead of thank you and people wonder what the heck I'm saying. I put the blame on this show being embedded into my mind when I was a 5 year-old (and still secretly love today #binyabinya ): https://t.co/Ek0jpzCIfg

With #bullying being talked about so much I think this is a video y'all ought to watch. Remember any way of degrading someone is bullying. If we don't like the way others are acting then observe, stand up and be the change. #fightwithkindness https://t.co/LeHEYomYK4
@garethritter I haven't seen any new things aside from the main video posted earlier. That's unfortunate to hear. Regardless, the video is on stopping bullying. I think that's the message we're trying to get to and teach everyone. Especially youth.
@chelsyjordan Note taken. 📝😂 though I'll do speaking and other TV/movie appearances along with singing. :)
But no one get any ideas!  It's already been done now 😂. Not quite sure that's how you get a boyfriend anyway. 🤷‍♂️ but very clever Bailey 😉
Uh... My booking agent just got this. Apparently he's booking more than shows now 😂😂#whatonearth https://t.co/yj5Croxuf4
@rosegoldhxrry 😂
When I say stop bullying I mean whether you're the one being mean to someone, or you know someone being mean. Have courage to stand up for someone being bullied so they're not alone, and be their friend. It can be scary but like Sara Bareilles says: "I wanna see you be brave!"
Wow, what a testament against bullying. Thank you Keaton for fighting with kindness. I hope we can all do the same. And as for bullying: Stop it.  #standwithkeaton #StopBullying https://t.co/oBgVbRiQjg

When you try to sing all the parts... to your own song. https://t.co/7N83UwnN5V
@arabtoremember It's the lyrics to the song! But you can pretend it's poetry.  Poetry is usually hard to understand anyway.
I can't either 🤷‍♂️ I meant to say something along the lines of "how and when did you come up with doing something like that" and tried to be witty using the lyrics. Didn't work too well 😂 oh well. https://t.co/7FyCBZYtNc
@sleepingatlast I think it'd be rad to do something with you sometime!! Would love to if you're ever up to it. Even if it's just for the heck of it.

I found internet.  I know this is a bit delayed, but how about Argentina, eh?  Or... che? #ArgentinaALaFinal
Long ✈️ to go see and perform for the troops. 🇺🇸 :)
Man, I feel kind of depressed for Brazil after watching that game.  Gotta show some respect for how much pressure that is.
P.S. I know a lot of you are concerned about me not having clothes, but I already bought new clothes so don't worry about me :). Thanks
Thanks to all who have sent fan letters and stuff to the fan PO box address!  Nice seeing the birthday books and letters :)

@peacesignpam after 2 years of never sleeping in, I have become a huge fan of how much easier it is to get things done in the mornings.
@Nellie1983 that's different from writing in the morning.  My mind is much more clear in the morning for ideas.
@AngelCat_5 oh, yes I am!
It's nice to get a song done before noon.  I feel refreshed.  Thank you @Dustinonline and @stephaniemabey for being morning people.
They're pretty comfy http://t.co/5ixFgQ2ag7

Happy Father's Day to all of you fathers!  Grateful for every kind of father out there and all you've taught me. http://t.co/MhuaftqZcE
I have to say though.. there is no greater, more life changing way to do it than serving a 2 year full-time mission ;)
Just made me miss my time in Chile, but reminds me that I don't have to be on a mission to do something that makes me feel so dang good.
"You have freedom, so why not use it to serve one another?"  - a lady DJ on the radio just now.

Hey, thanks for all of your insights!  Now going to get back to getting some song ideas moving, along with some other things. Let's do this.
@iamMissSingHDJA a balance in all things is important.  Don't want to sit around, but do what you do with dedication.
@kikaabdia Hm... Haha
@skittlesnj indeed!  I learned that the hard way before.  That's why I am trying things a different way this round.
@theashleywest We'll have to work on it together then!  It's one I think we both need that'll help us out in life in the future haha
@_Darlene I am patient in some things, and pretty impatient in others!  Like with myself for example!  But there are always room to grow.
@AndreaFOD true!  There just needs to be a balance to in everything.  We can get caught up in the details sometimes and not notice time fly.
@muldur That's a good insight!  Taking time to do things doesn't mean it's procrastination.  Thanks.
@iStalkArchie "there's no need to rush, it's like learning to fly, or falling in love.  It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen" haha
I'm finding out each day... how slow of a person I am.  I like things done right here and now! so I am realizing my need to learn #patience.

@intanmalindaa True love doesn't mean anything until you give it away. Now there's an interesting thought.  Very cool.
@pastelpastel I like that.
@nickuhlakin Interesting.  How does it do that though?  And where does it come from?
@refnaf Hm, interesting. So love is a choice? Hate seems to be a choice, right? It's something you have to choose to commit to, isn't it?
@legittlindsey So you mean it lasts forever?
@Artistsupporter Sacrifice, I think that would definitely be a part of it.
@cindyfredlina Hm, yeah it's interesting how it's something that's easier to feel than describe.  I wonder why.
@myheartsong Ah I like that.  It's unselfish.
@boobearHQ Haha, no no no.  I'm just curious.
How would you describe what true love is?  As cheesy as that is, I want to know lol.
