I'll be sharing more snippets over the next couple of days. Keep your eyes (and ears!) peeled for them... https://t.co/nvT5YwT8VT #WinterInTheAir
Also a fun fact: Whenever a song I record is completely finished, I always listen to it in my car to make sure it sounds exactly the way I imagined it to... which is why I decided to share the snippets from the car! üòÇüòÇ
With my new Christmas album coming out on Friday, I thought I'd share snippets of the new songs before it's released everywhere! Here are the first three songs off the album. üé∂ #WinterInTheAir  #1. "Christmas Every Day" #2. "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" #3. "Mary's Boy Child" https://t.co/VDX8fxzZB7
Surprise! ‚òÉÔ∏è Since there's only one week left until my new Christmas album is here, I thought I'd share a behind-the-scenes look at how my music video for #ChristmasEveryDay came together. We had a blast filming it! Watch it here: https://t.co/uhai9H4mKU. #FBF #WinterInTheAir https://t.co/2tJx0wQCyx

Just added some Christmas cheer to my @GIPHY profile page with GIFs from my new music video for #ChristmasEveryDay! https://t.co/FO5XzW9P9p https://t.co/czmykOIasW
Not only is it one of my favorite love songs, but one of my favorite songs to cover too. I just love its soothing melody! #DavidArchieMusicFacts
At the end of my time I did an album, especially for the fans there, as it was all music by Filipino artists. "Forevermore" being  one of them.
"Forevermore" is a Filipino song by Side A that I covered in 2012. That year I spent 6 weeks in the Philippines recording the mini-series ‚ÄúNandito Ako.‚Äù https://t.co/U2jpIhgwxx

1 year ago I released this album, Postcards in the Sky. This one means soooo much to me! My goal was to be authentic and more vulnerable, telling my story fighting myself forward. I‚Äôm so happy with what came out of it. Which song did you relate with most, and why? https://t.co/uJV1UzGZ7b

There were a lot of battles I had to fight as an 18-20 year-old. How I found my way through them is on this album like little post-it notes that reminded me to keep perspective and look ahead. #DavidArchieMusicFacts
I realized that who I was and my purpose didn‚Äôt come just from becoming famous. I needed  to take time to find who I really was. The album this song is from means a lot to me because it was a challenging time of life for me.
We continued to write ‚ÄúWho I Am‚Äù about disconnecting from the  craziness of keeping up with the public image as an artist, and connecting with God and with myself.
I told a few people including the people I worked with and I tried going before I made this 2nd album, but had a contract to still do another album with my record label. I talked to Shelly Peiken about it and she said ‚ÄúI think you should do it.‚Äù
I wrote ‚ÄúWho I Am‚Äù for my 2nd album ‚ÄúThe Other Side of Down‚Äù with Mike Krompass and Shelly Peiken. It was the first hint I gave to my fans that I was planning to go on my 2-year mission. #DavidArchieMusicFacts https://t.co/Dw5hX9WMhH
Nine years ago today I released my very first holiday album 'Christmas From The Heart'.

Hope you guys enjoyed that fun little tidbit about "Touch My Hand". Keep an eye out for more fun facts in the future! You can also guess which song you think will be featured next by using the hashtag #DavidArchieMusicFacts.
I recorded this song in a home studio in Oklahoma while I was on the American Idol tour and had a day off there in Oklahoma City. A sweet Oklahoman couple owned it and it was literally a living room feel in their home. üè°üé∂
A fun little fact, Steve Kipner told me after they heard me talking about wanting to connect with the audience but worried about not knowing what the song was about so they wrote a lyric specifically to that moment ‚ÄúI never knew what this song was about but suddenly now I do.‚Äù
"Touch My Hand" was written by Steve Kipner, Steve McEwan &amp; Wayne Wilkins!
With my new Christmas album coming out next month, I though it'd be fun to highlight some songs from my previous albums with fun facts about them! To kick it off, I wanted to start with a song from my debut album "Touch My Hand". How many of y'all remember this one? https://t.co/1RhysAK0DA

@suttygal üòÇ you know it!
@archftw Haha!  Didn‚Äôt think of it. Even if I tried and it worked I probably wouldn‚Äôt have learned my lesson. Just being honest. It stings but the sting got me to act and do something. Maybe it was a Godsend to prepare me for a moment where I needed to be more prepared than I would‚Äôve.
All right... I learned my lesson and have 2 phone holders on the way just in case one doesn‚Äôt work!  Thanks for the suggestions of the different types y‚Äôall!! #youliveyoulearn https://t.co/giTwjGO7ZN
@dannygokey Yeah man. :( going to get a phone holder this evening. Lesson learned!
@kalikakes96 Yeah, I had a phone holder but it kept falling off!  I‚Äôll just have to get another kind. Lol.
Careful following the #GPS on your phone while driving if you‚Äôre holding it in your hand y‚Äôall. Apparently you can get a $260 citation for distracted driving like I just did! üò©üò©üò™

Wow... farewell #QueenOfSoul.  Your songs and voice have forever changed the course of music and singers.   #riparetha https://t.co/iK1FsBEv7z
Those are all the "Crush" facts for today! Hope y'all enjoyed them. We still have a few fun things planned for the rest of the week so make sure you keep your üëÄ's peeled on my socials. #10YearsofCrush
Fact #4: Pop music with rhythm wasn't something I was familiar with so I'm proud with how the song turned out and it makes me happy to know y'all enjoy it still - even 10 years later. #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/M85OUb4dvz
Fact #3: Debunking those lyric questions... ü§î it's "is it real or just another crush" NOT "is it really just another crush". Hope this answers any confusion you may have had over the past decade! üòÇ #10YearsofCrush https://t.co/42UqP5aWNS

With #bullying being talked about so much I think this is a video y'all ought to watch. Remember any way of degrading someone is bullying. If we don't like the way others are acting then observe, stand up and be the change. #fightwithkindness https://t.co/LeHEYomYK4
@garethritter I haven't seen any new things aside from the main video posted earlier. That's unfortunate to hear. Regardless, the video is on stopping bullying. I think that's the message we're trying to get to and teach everyone. Especially youth.
@chelsyjordan Note taken. üìùüòÇ though I'll do speaking and other TV/movie appearances along with singing. :)

When I say stop bullying I mean whether you're the one being mean to someone, or you know someone being mean. Have courage to stand up for someone being bullied so they're not alone, and be their friend. It can be scary but like Sara Bareilles says: "I wanna see you be brave!"
Wow, what a testament against bullying. Thank you Keaton for fighting with kindness. I hope we can all do the same. And as for bullying: Stop it.  #standwithkeaton #StopBullying https://t.co/oBgVbRiQjg

@peacesignpam after 2 years of never sleeping in, I have become a huge fan of how much easier it is to get things done in the mornings.
@Nellie1983 that's different from writing in the morning.  My mind is much more clear in the morning for ideas.
@AngelCat_5 oh, yes I am!
It's nice to get a song done before noon.  I feel refreshed.  Thank you @Dustinonline and @stephaniemabey for being morning people.

@iamMissSingHDJA a balance in all things is important.  Don't want to sit around, but do what you do with dedication.
@kikaabdia Hm... Haha
@skittlesnj indeed!  I learned that the hard way before.  That's why I am trying things a different way this round.
@theashleywest We'll have to work on it together then!  It's one I think we both need that'll help us out in life in the future haha
@_Darlene I am patient in some things, and pretty impatient in others!  Like with myself for example!  But there are always room to grow.
@AndreaFOD true!  There just needs to be a balance to in everything.  We can get caught up in the details sometimes and not notice time fly.
@muldur That's a good insight!  Taking time to do things doesn't mean it's procrastination.  Thanks.

Went on another small road trip today.  So many things you think about on those drives, haha.  Nice scenery, too.

@emmmiley I said he's kind of like me.  No two people are the same, and Josh is not me.  He's Josh Bradley.
@Salamahafifi I think he was just trying to be nice, haha.  He obviously couldn't.
@omyheckjean There's a connection from long before that, though haha.  It makes them even more drawn to each other.
@TessariePotter Oh no way!  Awesome!
@nareejo Because Josh was somewhere new and didn't feel entirely comfortable yet relaxing, sleeping at a stranger's house on a hard surface.
Week 3 of Nandito Ako!  In the middle of the mini-series already.
Girl approaches: "My friend has a shirt of you."  Girl's cousin with her: "We have a build-a-bear shirt with you on it." Oh, lol

@intanmalindaa True love doesn't mean anything until you give it away. Now there's an interesting thought.  Very cool.
@pastelpastel I like that.
@nickuhlakin Interesting.  How does it do that though?  And where does it come from?
@refnaf Hm, interesting. So love is a choice? Hate seems to be a choice, right? It's something you have to choose to commit to, isn't it?
@legittlindsey So you mean it lasts forever?
@Artistsupporter Sacrifice, I think that would definitely be a part of it.
@cindyfredlina Hm, yeah it's interesting how it's something that's easier to feel than describe.  I wonder why.
@myheartsong Ah I like that.  It's unselfish.
@boobearHQ Haha, no no no.  I'm just curious.
How would you describe what true love is?  As cheesy as that is, I want to know lol.
Really fun performances today!  Thanks to Fox International Channels for having me come out for a great time in Singapore!
