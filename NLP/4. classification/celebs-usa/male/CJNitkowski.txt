Ordered this from a former all-time favorite teammate Alan Probst. His company @wildmeats1 is worth a visit. https://t.co/siF8s3HKZ3. The wild boar was killer. https://t.co/atoDAp7qWn
@wsvon @MattE_Diaz Good point.
@BradZiegler @roycap1963 2 per player someone just told me.
@roycap1963 I doubt he‚Äôs concerned. I get what you‚Äôre saying but Boras can handle multi big time free agent.
Concerning today's Leadoff Spot on @MLBNetworkRadio, 7-10AM ET:  - Kimbrel's agent has concerns. - LAD not concerned about Kershaw. - Scherzer is concerned about the pitch clock. - JD finds teams not competing concerning.  - Bryant puts 2018 concerns behind him.  PLUS.... https://t.co/us81QFHtO4
@KeithandMovies I dont think so either. The league says it‚Äôs not about time of games but rather pace, trying to put a dent in some of the dead time.
@DadsTalkingBall @spillygoat19 @MLBNetworkRadio Extremely.
@DadsTalkingBall @spillygoat19 @MLBNetworkRadio So funny.
It's been a minute, but Spilly and I are back! Loud Outs on @MLBNetworkRadio starts now.... https://t.co/s9xePFxsSq
@KatieD033 Luckily she doesn‚Äôt know.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 @MLBNetworkRadio @StevePhillipsGM @MattE_Diaz
@jojotoughguy That would be a good fit.
@MEdwardCanter Thanks Michael. Appreciate the listen and the tweet.
@MEdwardCanter We do our best to give the caller time but when they get too long we try and interrupt. Sometimes a peoducer will tell us in our ear (doesn‚Äôt go out over air) to push the caller along.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 I dont think he would.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 @MLBNetworkRadio We just talked about that and are wondering the same thing. Not confirmed and it's hard to believe it is unless they are going to expand payroll further than expected.
@Paramedic7225 I'd say at 10/$300 they made the right call. Would PHI fans rather have Harper or Keuchel/Kimbrel? I say more wins with K/K.
@rockeas24 I saw that. So awesome. I‚Äôll be in surprise March 10 through the 21st. We have about six games on TV. It would be great to see you. Let me know when you‚Äôre visiting.
The Leadoff Spot is on @MLBNetworkRadio from 7-10AM ET.   - The Cubs are out of cash. - MLB and the MLBPAA exchange in a war of words. - Wash. Post columnist criticizes Harper. - Top 10 Shortstops. - 9:35AM Todd Rosiak, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. https://t.co/0cYJPZ4Q9h

@SMcK85 Awesome. Enjoy. Played for SK, Doosan and the Heroes in 2009-10. Love it there, fans are awesome. Thank you for serving!
@SMcK85 Itaewon?
@Paramedic7225 @MattE_Diaz That was brutal when it happened. Of the top 4 I think they all sign, but it could be a guy like Adam Jones.
@SMcK85 Middle class owners would love that. , $4.5B in salary in a $10+B industry. Big markets would hate it.
@benderbutt Funny, I was thinking the same thing but I let it go. Almost said it on air.
@InDakWeTrust @EmilyJonesMcCoy I have the CD, I‚Äôll send you a copy, she‚Äôs pretty special on the piano.
@joshlewinstuff I read in one article that was the main reason you took the job, which is totally understandable.
@joshlewinstuff Congrats! Been patiently waiting for this update and patience is not a strength of mine. You deserve it.
@kipppsta Haha, it happens.
@MEdwardCanter Thank you Michael, hope you are staying warm, baseball is almost here.
As fathers of young boys it's our job to look for those teachable moments so that they grow up to be men of character and great husbands. Like when my wife gets home after getting her hair done with new color and asks him how it looks he shouldn't say, "you look different." https://t.co/duYLGCgZax
@gdavistweets A new pitcher in the organization will be paired with the top catchers early on so they can get a feel for each other. A new catcher will get paired with the top pitchers.

@Evan_P_Grant Is this your rehearsal outfit?
@MostlyforMLB I was not insinuating that. Impressed by height of ball when he got it.
@jdfoster70 I‚Äôd like a measurement of how high the ball was off the ground when he blocked it. At least 11‚Äô.
@Sweendog9 With the 27.5‚Äù ball.
@Sweendog9 That‚Äôs what I do to my youngest in the driveway. I don‚Äôt care that he‚Äôs 10, it feels good.

@bobfrench Not sure if you saw this... https://t.co/r9kZKSkOSb
@bobfrench Not necessarily. I use a word document to get everything the way I want it thensave as a pdf. That might mean uploading any graphics that I would use into the word document. I usually type the lineup into the word document before I convert it.
@georgewrighster I always do with thin mints, Caramel deLites too?
@Stefmara Fancy.
@milksy25 Stopped counting.
@Stefmara It‚Äôs nice to know we‚Äôre not alone. Red felt right with the Caramel deLite/Samoa, it‚Äôs the closest GS cookie to red meat.

@bobfrench Hi Bob, I use the cheapest version of the normal sized iPad, not the mini or the pro. Not exactly sure what size that is. The latest version is compatible with the iPen which makes writing my scorecards pretty easy
@JaredSandler He knows it!
@JaredSandler ‚ÄúWait, why did he shoot that?‚Äù - 10yo. Luke Nitkowski
@coachmatt34 @AWhite7877 I agree.
@Scott_Weiss I feel like I contributed to you wasting some time today. I feel bad about that.
@Scott_Weiss You could count on one muppet hand how many pitchers are better hitters than an MLB starting player, not necessary to adjust that part of the rule.
@Scott_Weiss Against the rules, you can only DH for the pitcher.
@KatieD033 3rd place of the group but pretty good.
@Scott_Weiss Sure, but you can‚Äôt do that with a 25 man roster.
@eastcoasthacker No. I stopped hitting after my Freshman year in HS.
@Scott_Weiss No, you can only DH for the P.
@MFrazier1998 @PerezEd @StevePhillipsGM Why did you stop?
@BergmanGreg In high school, yes.
@CJ_Esposito #TeamCJs
@AWhite7877 Risk vs. reward is not there to start training pitchers to hit. The skills sets are polar opposites. Just because you can throw 95 mph doesn‚Äôt mean you should also be able to learn to hit big league pitching at an acceptable level.
@DTrainMLB üòÇ I‚Äôm sorry Train. If we could all hit like you it would be a different story. But most of us really suck at it.
@AWhite7877 Catchers train to hit their whole careers, pitchers do not.
We don't take a QB out of the game because he can't kick field goals or cover a wide receiver. The best players should be on the field whenever possible doing the thing they do best in their sport, not because they're bad at the thing they're not paid to do.  #UniversalDHnow
Compelling strategies in baseball are things like defensive shifts, lineup construction, pitch selection, bullpen matchups, stealing bases, when to hit and run, etc. When to take out a pitcher who's pitching effectively but can't hit is not a compelling strategy.
@kchae79 I agree, it's not all about hitting but we are seeing records in strikeouts and lack of balls in play, that's an ongoing issue for the game that they are trying to at least slow down. It's a problem for the game as a whole, not the enthusiasts like us.
@UVApolitics87 @kchae79 @NicolasCook15 @radioguycliff Audience is getting older and pace is an issue. I hate that it is true but it is, they have to figure out a way to slow that trend. For those that love the game like us it's a non-issue and you don't want to alienate your base but they have to make the change.
@jimmysjargon https://t.co/ya5jmQ6OJl
@CJ_Esposito I'd agree, fair assessment.
@NicolasCook15 @UVApolitics87 @radioguycliff Last 4 years: Pitchers: .319 OPS / 100 HR DH: .763 OPS / 1,652 HR  I'll take the offense, we need it.
Talking Eric Hosmer as a bounce back candidate in 2019 on @MLBNetworkRadio . Fascinating spray chart, especially regarding home runs, for a guy who has a low launch angle, 2.1 (17-18) via @Sportradar... https://t.co/kbUH09c6Jb
@radioguycliff I did, but I was terrible at it. Wasn't good for the game.
We'll talk about this plus...  - Harper as a Giant?  - Judge says "make the right choice."  - Bounce back players in 2019. - Best power duos in MLB. (Hint: it's not Phillips and Nitkowski)  The Leadoff Spot on @MLBNetworkRadio is on from 7-10AM ET. Sirius 209 / XM 89. https://t.co/1BWchpgjni

@warriorboss2 I personally don't like taking team wins away, if the Yankees missed the post season because Tulo got popped NYY fans might torture him the rest of his life.

@outbound_vegas Ultimate Zone Rating, a defensive metric
@MarkASimonSays Nomar Mazzara had one of, if not the, lowest launch angle of any hitter who hit at least 20 homeruns. We‚Äôll put that in context and we‚Äôll show the top/bottom five players and explain what that means etc. That‚Äôs how I like to do it. Player specific, make it digestible to fans.
@MarkASimonSays I‚Äôll talk the baseball angle, the work he‚Äôs done, how he shown more range etc and then I‚Äôll put a new number on it.
@MarkASimonSays We pick our spots. But the issue with only one stat is it may not offer a ton for every player. So what I do when I‚Äôm digging in is I‚Äôll look for something that will tell a story specific to a player. Ex. Odor‚Äôs UZR last three yrs. He made a big jump last year.

@_RSR32 PED related?
@corbs872 One will be 1st ballot, the other will miss on attempt number 7.
https://t.co/lYLpIowiLw
@Paramedic7225 I agree, but it's here to stay
@Paramedic7225 I'd say the limited mound visits have helped. This whole thing for me is about making up for dead time instant replay creates.
@Nation23Yankees @MLBNetworkRadio That is always a possibility. Never say never until those players are wearing a different uniform.
@MatGermain76 I'm not sure who or which team, but I think you're on the right path.
The Leadoff Spot is on @MLBNetworkRadio. Full show, Roy Halladay's former manager Buck Martinez will join us...  7-10AM ET, 866-652-6696 https://t.co/DcHhsgC527

@cougie725 @spillygoat19 Much appreciated Carmelo. Always humbling when people say the like our work. These kinds of tweets are not lost on us.
@cougie725 @spillygoat19 Thanks Carmelo. The frustration is real all the way around. Spring training will be here soon, then opening day and the variety of content will pick up.
@kphillipscu @spillygoat19 Same.
@kphillipscu @spillygoat19 As the price comes down other teams start to get interested.
@AllTTV2015 I'm not an insider but maybe.
@lot_49 They're on my list of 7, just not top 3.
@PistolayGaming HIPAA
@courtney883 Don't give up hope yet.
@AllTTV2015 I personally don't see it. If he didn't play there last year it would be more of a possibility IMO.
@PistolayGaming They don't tell us who, only the numbers.

After an exhaustive process your Loud Outs crew has their top 3 mystery teams for Manny Machado (strictly speculation):  Spilly: 1 - ATL, 2 - NYM, 3 - SEA CJ: 1 - ATL, 2 - SEA, 3 - LAA
@JoseDee4 I think you may be right, maybe $25-27M now.
@rhrem7_rick 22nd and 13th in the league.
@tjco1006 An example for all! Thanks Tim. FWIW, you‚Äôre not the only one who disagrees, the PED guys are getting lots of votes.
We have our best people on it. Spilly and friends will solve the big mystery.... https://t.co/dWa3H3EwQw
@AnthonyDeFilip2 Class of '91.
@cgarrett2482 Yes, at times, but not for COL. https://t.co/SgSU1Ie0tm
@cgarrett2482 Great combination! Glad you got the tumbler. Thanks for the support and Happy Birthday.

@JoeAppio They could but I don‚Äôt think he takes that.
@erickalmonte13 Congrats!
@JeffFletcherOCR It was known, or at least suspected, suspicions started to really accelerate around 99-00 IMO. When the dust finally settled I think even players were surprised at how many guys were likely using.
@JeffFletcherOCR If players knew they would have been rewarded for using down the road likely more would have done it. They thought they were doing the right thing by not taking, seeing users get votes is a slap in the face to those who didn‚Äôt.
@JeffFletcherOCR It wasn‚Äôt part of the culture to think about stopping it. The mentality was you used or deal with facing guys that were using. A personal ethical decision. There were a lot of unknowns at the time. Then suddenly a guy hits 73 and another in his 40s wins a Cy.
@rponcejr Very good.
@Evan_P_Grant Pretty sure is not what Chris Archet was talking about.
@Evan_P_Grant According to the survey testing of 2003 somewhere between 5-10% of players tested positive for steroids. That was prior to MLB PED penalties being in place. A yes vote for a PED Hall of Famer is a slap in the face to the other 90-95% who knew better.
@Evan_P_Grant That‚Äôs right. Have you voted for a player who you know illegally possessed and took amphetamines?
@Evan_P_Grant Possessing and using steroids was always illegal. Guys were not buying steroids from GNC and using them. Is it baseball‚Äôs obligation to tell it‚Äôs players that they are not allowed to do things that are already prohibited by US law? Otherwise they can assume that it‚Äôs OK?
@bethsuek I‚Äôm with you.
@Paramedic7225 I agree.
@JoeAppio If he (reportedly) turned down 10/$300, I don‚Äôt think 6/$200 is enough to get it done.
@4sqms I agree, the time it takes is frustrating.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 Really good but maybe not the best. We still need a few more really good players to sign to make that call.
@Bellhorn19 It's also risky because which do you do first? Harper or trade? No guarantee the second thing will happen.
@Bellhorn19 I work to keep my outfield intact as much as possible.
@kwynn2411 https://t.co/PHCuxl3iax

@NotBumpWills Turn Bob into @daveraymond4 and we might have a winner.
@joerand Hard to say since it wasn‚Äôt me. Different perspective when you‚Äôve long been retired. As a youngster I might have felt differently.
@erickalmonte13 A+ bat flip.
@GDBJr5 Good (and bad) memories in all those places. From watching games as a kid in old Yankee Stadium and a few at Shea, to Chuck Knoblauch taking me deep at the Metrodome, to having the honor of wearing the Yankee pinstripes for a brief moment. Good stuff Gary,
@The_RightCall @Rangers It's getting closer...
@RyanFieldABC Does that mean you‚Äôre now the top bachelor in sports media?
@jimmysjargon @imBenBerry @TaraSledjeski @StevePhillipsGM Nice. Give it to them!
@jjdatt Another good one.

@Paramedic7225 If I'm a team that gets pushed backed I'm irritated but they agreed to it.
Good morning! The Leadoff Spot is on @MLBNetworkRadio. @StevePhillipsGM &amp; I have you covered on Sirius 209/XM 89. 866-MLB-ON-XM, lots to get to including "to tweet or not to tweet." https://t.co/7YxQO1q1Qs

@Megan_Broadway You'll love it. One of the first things you'll notice, or at least that I did, detail of trees in the distance and license plates pop when you're driving. (Weird, I know.)
@Megan_Broadway My eyes weren't that bad, but I was having an issue seeing the catcher's signs from the mound w/o using contacts which I hated putting in. Day after surgery I was 20/15 and haven't had any regression 18 yrs later. Process is kind of wild, if you're not super squeamish it's easy.
@DouglasPConrad Hey Doug. He‚Äôll give the offense a boost they need but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôre a post season team right now. AL runs really deep. They‚Äôd need to with the division and the Indians will be tough.
@Megan_Broadway üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Had it in ‚Äò00, easy, quick, totally worth it.
@BarryEnright45 Congrats!
@ademeo44_de Good to see you coming to your senses Ant. Seats on the bandwagon  still available.
@jimmysjargon I'm ùô´ùôöùôßùôÆ impressed.
@jimmysjargon Totally fair. How did you do bold italic in tweet? Your talents have no limits.
@24yankfan @CraigatNeptune Didn't come up, probably Sat on Loud Outs.
@CraigatNeptune Thanks Craig.
@anthonyh2388 Agree. I'm sure if all were healthy Barria starts in the minors. I was curious if one of the lefty starters could play up as an elite reliever in the pen.
@Rangers Feeling pretty good about this... https://t.co/4WhYskOoCZ
@cgarrett2482 Chris, that's great man. You won't find anyone who has some years of marriage under their belt that hasn't gone through trying times. It's not always easy but it's worth the effort. Thanks for the kind words.
@MattNatali Pretty tough call for sure. I'd take Rendon and a piece or two more.
@MattNatali @MLBNetworkRadio All fair points. If you could only have one, Rendon (with some extra cash to spend) or Harper now, who do you want?
@24yankfan Tuesday.
@himynameisalex4 Happy New Year Alex.
@sillywabbit40 Happy New Year!  Don‚Äôt make me do it. https://t.co/tDrKdRVucy

@BreakfastGerald They definitely should be.
@InsideRyanshead @MLBNetworkRadio Only 4 options on Twitter polls, PHI/CHC was a toss up, it was heads.
@tjco1006 That was a rough one.
@bpwooldridge @MLBNetworkRadio I haven't heard them connected to Harper this off-season.
@ItsBeen71Years @spillygoat19 I'd say well, he had a good run for the Rangers the rest of that year and got to catch in 2017. That wasn't a guarantee with CLE for '17, he made the right choice.
@BehindthePlate4 @MLBNetworkRadio It was a tough call, only 4 poll options on Twitter.

@BuschLeague3 Never a bother. Tough call. He has great value in the trade market which is tempting. I think you have to listen and let someone knock your socks off. Corner outfielders in general are not difficult to find.
@BuschLeague3 They won‚Äôt wait around long. They‚Äôll spend within the next two years while hoping the lower level prospects and recent minor leaguers they traded for will be ready. That‚Äôs my guess. New stadium will be awesome and they‚Äôll be ready for a run.
@joerand @MLBNetworkRadio Joe, thank you so much. Happy New Year to you and yours.
@KatieD033 Happy New Year Katie.
@jimmysjargon Much better.
@moxxjason It's a challenge, especially if you don't have to wear one regularly. My 19-yo still struggles, I usually tie his ties for him.
@benderbutt It would be awkward.
@802DougVT Fair point.
@kipppsta @spillygoat19 Thanks Kipp!
@RWRittenhouse haha, that is more fun for sure.
@rhrem7_rick I only had a few made for the crew. If we make more and make them available I'll be sure to post.

@mmesalmon I‚Äôm not sure it impacts their ability to spend. But whenever you don‚Äôt have the major markets bidding on players it certainly gives other teams a chance to afford good free agents.
@dbodemer Thank you David. I‚Äôm planning on riding this out for a while. I‚Äôll try again in 5-7 years.
@KatieD033 Thanks Katie, Merry Christmas.
@Paramedic7225 We have touched on that some. At 10/370 I wouldn‚Äôt be all that confident he would opt out.
