Ordered this from a former all-time favorite teammate Alan Probst. His company @wildmeats1 is worth a visit. https://t.co/siF8s3HKZ3. The wild boar was killer. https://t.co/atoDAp7qWn
@wsvon @MattE_Diaz Good point.
@BradZiegler @roycap1963 2 per player someone just told me.
@roycap1963 I doubt he’s concerned. I get what you’re saying but Boras can handle multi big time free agent.
Concerning today's Leadoff Spot on @MLBNetworkRadio, 7-10AM ET:  - Kimbrel's agent has concerns. - LAD not concerned about Kershaw. - Scherzer is concerned about the pitch clock. - JD finds teams not competing concerning.  - Bryant puts 2018 concerns behind him.  PLUS.... https://t.co/us81QFHtO4
@KeithandMovies I dont think so either. The league says it’s not about time of games but rather pace, trying to put a dent in some of the dead time.
@DadsTalkingBall @spillygoat19 @MLBNetworkRadio Extremely.
@DadsTalkingBall @spillygoat19 @MLBNetworkRadio So funny.
It's been a minute, but Spilly and I are back! Loud Outs on @MLBNetworkRadio starts now.... https://t.co/s9xePFxsSq
@KatieD033 Luckily she doesn’t know.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 @MLBNetworkRadio @StevePhillipsGM @MattE_Diaz
@jojotoughguy That would be a good fit.
@MEdwardCanter Thanks Michael. Appreciate the listen and the tweet.
@MEdwardCanter We do our best to give the caller time but when they get too long we try and interrupt. Sometimes a peoducer will tell us in our ear (doesn’t go out over air) to push the caller along.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 I dont think he would.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 @MLBNetworkRadio We just talked about that and are wondering the same thing. Not confirmed and it's hard to believe it is unless they are going to expand payroll further than expected.
@Paramedic7225 I'd say at 10/$300 they made the right call. Would PHI fans rather have Harper or Keuchel/Kimbrel? I say more wins with K/K.
@rockeas24 I saw that. So awesome. I’ll be in surprise March 10 through the 21st. We have about six games on TV. It would be great to see you. Let me know when you’re visiting.
The Leadoff Spot is on @MLBNetworkRadio from 7-10AM ET.   - The Cubs are out of cash. - MLB and the MLBPAA exchange in a war of words. - Wash. Post columnist criticizes Harper. - Top 10 Shortstops. - 9:35AM Todd Rosiak, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. https://t.co/0cYJPZ4Q9h
@bergerhere It’s all about the slide.
@rockeas24 Appreciate that Rock. Hope all is well, best to the family.

@PeteG723 Same here.
@joelrondeau Good question. I’m not sure.
@TexasAmerica Thanks Tex!

@ChadMcDonald11 Not sure what you’re taking about. I’m not working today.
@SMcK85 Awesome. Enjoy. Played for SK, Doosan and the Heroes in 2009-10. Love it there, fans are awesome. Thank you for serving!
@SMcK85 Itaewon?
@Paramedic7225 @MattE_Diaz That was brutal when it happened. Of the top 4 I think they all sign, but it could be a guy like Adam Jones.
@SMcK85 Middle class owners would love that. , $4.5B in salary in a $10+B industry. Big markets would hate it.
@benderbutt Funny, I was thinking the same thing but I let it go. Almost said it on air.
@InDakWeTrust @EmilyJonesMcCoy I have the CD, I’ll send you a copy, she’s pretty special on the piano.
@joshlewinstuff I read in one article that was the main reason you took the job, which is totally understandable.
@joshlewinstuff Congrats! Been patiently waiting for this update and patience is not a strength of mine. You deserve it.
@kipppsta Haha, it happens.
@MEdwardCanter Thank you Michael, hope you are staying warm, baseball is almost here.
As fathers of young boys it's our job to look for those teachable moments so that they grow up to be men of character and great husbands. Like when my wife gets home after getting her hair done with new color and asks him how it looks he shouldn't say, "you look different." https://t.co/duYLGCgZax
@gdavistweets A new pitcher in the organization will be paired with the top catchers early on so they can get a feel for each other. A new catcher will get paired with the top pitchers.
“Baseball” season is almost here. https://t.co/5w1XVCAIRx
@Evan_P_Grant Is this your rehearsal outfit?
@MostlyforMLB I was not insinuating that. Impressed by height of ball when he got it.
@jdfoster70 I’d like a measurement of how high the ball was off the ground when he blocked it. At least 11’.
@Sweendog9 With the 27.5” ball.
@Sweendog9 That’s what I do to my youngest in the driveway. I don’t care that he’s 10, it feels good.

@cgarrett2482 Thanks Chris. Next week is my last basketball Saturday. I’ll be back in 2 weeks.
@bobfrench Not sure if you saw this... https://t.co/r9kZKSkOSb
@bobfrench Not necessarily. I use a word document to get everything the way I want it thensave as a pdf. That might mean uploading any graphics that I would use into the word document. I usually type the lineup into the word document before I convert it.
@georgewrighster I always do with thin mints, Caramel deLites too?
@Stefmara Fancy.
@milksy25 Stopped counting.
@Stefmara It’s nice to know we’re not alone. Red felt right with the Caramel deLite/Samoa, it’s the closest GS cookie to red meat.
Red wine and Caramel deLites for dinner. I should open a restaurant. https://t.co/7CQw0RiOY7
@bobfrench Hi Bob, I use the cheapest version of the normal sized iPad, not the mini or the pro. Not exactly sure what size that is. The latest version is compatible with the iPen which makes writing my scorecards pretty easy
@JaredSandler He knows it!
@JaredSandler “Wait, why did he shoot that?” - 10yo. Luke Nitkowski
@coachmatt34 @AWhite7877 I agree.
@Scott_Weiss I feel like I contributed to you wasting some time today. I feel bad about that.
@Scott_Weiss You could count on one muppet hand how many pitchers are better hitters than an MLB starting player, not necessary to adjust that part of the rule.
@Scott_Weiss Against the rules, you can only DH for the pitcher.
@KatieD033 3rd place of the group but pretty good.
@Scott_Weiss Sure, but you can’t do that with a 25 man roster.
@eastcoasthacker No. I stopped hitting after my Freshman year in HS.
@Scott_Weiss No, you can only DH for the P.
@MFrazier1998 @PerezEd @StevePhillipsGM Why did you stop?
@BergmanGreg In high school, yes.
@CJ_Esposito #TeamCJs
@AWhite7877 Risk vs. reward is not there to start training pitchers to hit. The skills sets are polar opposites. Just because you can throw 95 mph doesn’t mean you should also be able to learn to hit big league pitching at an acceptable level.
@DTrainMLB 😂 I’m sorry Train. If we could all hit like you it would be a different story. But most of us really suck at it.
@AWhite7877 Catchers train to hit their whole careers, pitchers do not.
We don't take a QB out of the game because he can't kick field goals or cover a wide receiver. The best players should be on the field whenever possible doing the thing they do best in their sport, not because they're bad at the thing they're not paid to do.  #UniversalDHnow
Compelling strategies in baseball are things like defensive shifts, lineup construction, pitch selection, bullpen matchups, stealing bases, when to hit and run, etc. When to take out a pitcher who's pitching effectively but can't hit is not a compelling strategy.
@kchae79 I agree, it's not all about hitting but we are seeing records in strikeouts and lack of balls in play, that's an ongoing issue for the game that they are trying to at least slow down. It's a problem for the game as a whole, not the enthusiasts like us.
@UVApolitics87 @kchae79 @NicolasCook15 @radioguycliff Audience is getting older and pace is an issue. I hate that it is true but it is, they have to figure out a way to slow that trend. For those that love the game like us it's a non-issue and you don't want to alienate your base but they have to make the change.
@jimmysjargon https://t.co/ya5jmQ6OJl
@CJ_Esposito I'd agree, fair assessment.
@NicolasCook15 @UVApolitics87 @radioguycliff Last 4 years: Pitchers: .319 OPS / 100 HR DH: .763 OPS / 1,652 HR  I'll take the offense, we need it.
Talking Eric Hosmer as a bounce back candidate in 2019 on @MLBNetworkRadio . Fascinating spray chart, especially regarding home runs, for a guy who has a low launch angle, 2.1 (17-18) via @Sportradar... https://t.co/kbUH09c6Jb
@radioguycliff I did, but I was terrible at it. Wasn't good for the game.
We'll talk about this plus...  - Harper as a Giant?  - Judge says "make the right choice."  - Bounce back players in 2019. - Best power duos in MLB. (Hint: it's not Phillips and Nitkowski)  The Leadoff Spot on @MLBNetworkRadio is on from 7-10AM ET. Sirius 209 / XM 89. https://t.co/1BWchpgjni

@warriorboss2 I personally don't like taking team wins away, if the Yankees missed the post season because Tulo got popped NYY fans might torture him the rest of his life.

@Misopogon 🔥🐜
@outbound_vegas Ultimate Zone Rating, a defensive metric
@MarkASimonSays Nomar Mazzara had one of, if not the, lowest launch angle of any hitter who hit at least 20 homeruns. We’ll put that in context and we’ll show the top/bottom five players and explain what that means etc. That’s how I like to do it. Player specific, make it digestible to fans.
@MarkASimonSays I’ll talk the baseball angle, the work he’s done, how he shown more range etc and then I’ll put a new number on it.
@MarkASimonSays We pick our spots. But the issue with only one stat is it may not offer a ton for every player. So what I do when I’m digging in is I’ll look for something that will tell a story specific to a player. Ex. Odor’s UZR last three yrs. He made a big jump last year.

@cougie725 @spillygoat19 Thanks Carmelo. The frustration is real all the way around. Spring training will be here soon, then opening day and the variety of content will pick up.
@kphillipscu @spillygoat19 Same.
@kphillipscu @spillygoat19 As the price comes down other teams start to get interested.
@AllTTV2015 I'm not an insider but maybe.
@lot_49 They're on my list of 7, just not top 3.
@PistolayGaming HIPAA
@courtney883 Don't give up hope yet.
@AllTTV2015 I personally don't see it. If he didn't play there last year it would be more of a possibility IMO.
@PistolayGaming They don't tell us who, only the numbers.

After an exhaustive process your Loud Outs crew has their top 3 mystery teams for Manny Machado (strictly speculation):  Spilly: 1 - ATL, 2 - NYM, 3 - SEA CJ: 1 - ATL, 2 - SEA, 3 - LAA
@JoseDee4 I think you may be right, maybe $25-27M now.
@rhrem7_rick 22nd and 13th in the league.
@tjco1006 An example for all! Thanks Tim. FWIW, you’re not the only one who disagrees, the PED guys are getting lots of votes.
We have our best people on it. Spilly and friends will solve the big mystery.... https://t.co/dWa3H3EwQw
@AnthonyDeFilip2 Class of '91.
@cgarrett2482 Yes, at times, but not for COL. https://t.co/SgSU1Ie0tm
@cgarrett2482 Great combination! Glad you got the tumbler. Thanks for the support and Happy Birthday.
Happy Saturday! It’s Loud Outs on @MLBNetworkRadio, 10-1 ET.  ▪️Yankees in on Arenado? ▪️Solving the Machado Mystery. ▪️Will things get Gray in Cincinnati? ▪️Free agent frustration.  ▪️Doc Roberts talks Rich Hill. https://t.co/CE8cjZJuQ8
@JoeAppio They could but I don’t think he takes that.
@erickalmonte13 Congrats!
@JeffFletcherOCR It was known, or at least suspected, suspicions started to really accelerate around 99-00 IMO. When the dust finally settled I think even players were surprised at how many guys were likely using.
@JeffFletcherOCR If players knew they would have been rewarded for using down the road likely more would have done it. They thought they were doing the right thing by not taking, seeing users get votes is a slap in the face to those who didn’t.
@JeffFletcherOCR It wasn’t part of the culture to think about stopping it. The mentality was you used or deal with facing guys that were using. A personal ethical decision. There were a lot of unknowns at the time. Then suddenly a guy hits 73 and another in his 40s wins a Cy.
@rponcejr Very good.
@Evan_P_Grant Pretty sure is not what Chris Archet was talking about.
@Evan_P_Grant According to the survey testing of 2003 somewhere between 5-10% of players tested positive for steroids. That was prior to MLB PED penalties being in place. A yes vote for a PED Hall of Famer is a slap in the face to the other 90-95% who knew better.
@Evan_P_Grant That’s right. Have you voted for a player who you know illegally possessed and took amphetamines?
@Evan_P_Grant Possessing and using steroids was always illegal. Guys were not buying steroids from GNC and using them. Is it baseball’s obligation to tell it’s players that they are not allowed to do things that are already prohibited by US law? Otherwise they can assume that it’s OK?
@bethsuek I’m with you.
@Paramedic7225 I agree.
@JoeAppio If he (reportedly) turned down 10/$300, I don’t think 6/$200 is enough to get it done.
@4sqms I agree, the time it takes is frustrating.
@AnthonyDeFilip2 Really good but maybe not the best. We still need a few more really good players to sign to make that call.
@Bellhorn19 It's also risky because which do you do first? Harper or trade? No guarantee the second thing will happen.
@Bellhorn19 I work to keep my outfield intact as much as possible.
@kwynn2411 https://t.co/PHCuxl3iax
@kwynn2411 @StevePhillipsGM Haha, fair point.
@kwynn2411 @StevePhillipsGM August is the only month in his career where he is sub 4.00.

@NotBumpWills Turn Bob into @daveraymond4 and we might have a winner.
@joerand Hard to say since it wasn’t me. Different perspective when you’ve long been retired. As a youngster I might have felt differently.
@erickalmonte13 A+ bat flip.
@GDBJr5 Good (and bad) memories in all those places. From watching games as a kid in old Yankee Stadium and a few at Shea, to Chuck Knoblauch taking me deep at the Metrodome, to having the honor of wearing the Yankee pinstripes for a brief moment. Good stuff Gary,
@The_RightCall @Rangers It's getting closer...
@RyanFieldABC Does that mean you’re now the top bachelor in sports media?
@jimmysjargon @imBenBerry @TaraSledjeski @StevePhillipsGM Nice. Give it to them!
@jjdatt Another good one.
@RobbySanders127 OH, good one.
@Jpow1234four Hard to pull that off in Boston but I agree.
@RobbySanders127 Active
@Paramedic7225 If I'm a team that gets pushed backed I'm irritated but they agreed to it.
Good morning! The Leadoff Spot is on @MLBNetworkRadio. @StevePhillipsGM &amp; I have you covered on Sirius 209/XM 89. 866-MLB-ON-XM, lots to get to including "to tweet or not to tweet." https://t.co/7YxQO1q1Qs
We thought Sept 30th might be Adrián Beltré's last game. Turned out to be so. Ran across my scorecard from that game today. If you want a full copy you can download it here:   https://t.co/nCDQEuHsap https://t.co/yHFuhSJ0cP
@Megan_Broadway You'll love it. One of the first things you'll notice, or at least that I did, detail of trees in the distance and license plates pop when you're driving. (Weird, I know.)
@Megan_Broadway My eyes weren't that bad, but I was having an issue seeing the catcher's signs from the mound w/o using contacts which I hated putting in. Day after surgery I was 20/15 and haven't had any regression 18 yrs later. Process is kind of wild, if you're not super squeamish it's easy.
@DouglasPConrad Hey Doug. He’ll give the offense a boost they need but I’m not sure they’re a post season team right now. AL runs really deep. They’d need to with the division and the Indians will be tough.
@Megan_Broadway 🙋‍♂️ Had it in ‘00, easy, quick, totally worth it.
@BarryEnright45 Congrats!
@ademeo44_de Good to see you coming to your senses Ant. Seats on the bandwagon  still available.
@jimmysjargon I'm 𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮 impressed.
@jimmysjargon Totally fair. How did you do bold italic in tweet? Your talents have no limits.
@24yankfan @CraigatNeptune Didn't come up, probably Sat on Loud Outs.
@CraigatNeptune Thanks Craig.
@anthonyh2388 Agree. I'm sure if all were healthy Barria starts in the minors. I was curious if one of the lefty starters could play up as an elite reliever in the pen.
@Rangers Feeling pretty good about this... https://t.co/4WhYskOoCZ
@cgarrett2482 Chris, that's great man. You won't find anyone who has some years of marriage under their belt that hasn't gone through trying times. It's not always easy but it's worth the effort. Thanks for the kind words.
@MattNatali Pretty tough call for sure. I'd take Rendon and a piece or two more.
@MattNatali @MLBNetworkRadio All fair points. If you could only have one, Rendon (with some extra cash to spend) or Harper now, who do you want?
@24yankfan Tuesday.
@himynameisalex4 Happy New Year Alex.
@sillywabbit40 Happy New Year!  Don’t make me do it. https://t.co/tDrKdRVucy
@RJC_Cards Happy New Year. 0 for 1 career.
@BreakfastGerald They definitely should be.
@InsideRyanshead @MLBNetworkRadio Only 4 options on Twitter polls, PHI/CHC was a toss up, it was heads.
@tjco1006 That was a rough one.
@bpwooldridge @MLBNetworkRadio I haven't heard them connected to Harper this off-season.
@ItsBeen71Years @spillygoat19 I'd say well, he had a good run for the Rangers the rest of that year and got to catch in 2017. That wasn't a guarantee with CLE for '17, he made the right choice.
@BehindthePlate4 @MLBNetworkRadio It was a tough call, only 4 poll options on Twitter.

@BuschLeague3 Never a bother. Tough call. He has great value in the trade market which is tempting. I think you have to listen and let someone knock your socks off. Corner outfielders in general are not difficult to find.
@BuschLeague3 They won’t wait around long. They’ll spend within the next two years while hoping the lower level prospects and recent minor leaguers they traded for will be ready. That’s my guess. New stadium will be awesome and they’ll be ready for a run.
@joerand @MLBNetworkRadio Joe, thank you so much. Happy New Year to you and yours.
@KatieD033 Happy New Year Katie.
@jimmysjargon Much better.
@moxxjason It's a challenge, especially if you don't have to wear one regularly. My 19-yo still struggles, I usually tie his ties for him.
@benderbutt It would be awkward.
@802DougVT Fair point.
@kipppsta @spillygoat19 Thanks Kipp!
@RWRittenhouse haha, that is more fun for sure.
@rhrem7_rick I only had a few made for the crew. If we make more and make them available I'll be sure to post.
Loud Outs with @spillygoat19 &amp; myself is coming up at the top of the hour, 10-1 ET on @MLBNetworkRadio, Sirius 209/XM 89. 866-MLB-ON-XM. https://t.co/ldrusxhVBQ
@PistolayGaming If you do it right, 6 hours of radio is a 10 hour day, 2 hours of prep for each show.

@julie10128 TV revenue is where is at. Where do you think the best location would be in that area to draw the most fans?
@Shawnyd2013 Once the season starts you can send it to the stadium in Arlington. Address it to me - Home TV Booth.
@Shawnyd2013 anytime
@wschouten3 @Shawnyd2013 Ha. You missed the window to cash in!

@mmesalmon I’m not sure it impacts their ability to spend. But whenever you don’t have the major markets bidding on players it certainly gives other teams a chance to afford good free agents.
@dbodemer Thank you David. I’m planning on riding this out for a while. I’ll try again in 5-7 years.
@KatieD033 Thanks Katie, Merry Christmas.
@Paramedic7225 We have touched on that some. At 10/370 I wouldn’t be all that confident he would opt out.
It's still Christmas here on the Leadoff Spot....me and @PerezEd have you covered with plenty of Christmas spirit, 7-10AM ET on @MLBNetworkRadio. https://t.co/CSVd2kEc3O
@Baseball_More @Mike_Ferrin Haha. Enjoy!
@dbodemer Start planning next year now. Couple of small things like a personalized yeti, a new carry on that was engraved with her initials. My wife loves Lululemon, lots of opportunities there.
@dbodemer I opened the wallet a little bit this year, haven't always in the past.
@wezzaljr2 Check the backyards too, quite the slicer.
