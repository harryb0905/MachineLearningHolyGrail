Let him without sin cast the first stone.
But to stand on a soap box &amp; tell everyone that doesn't believe the same that they are wrong is ugly, self righteous, and ignorant.

@chgojoemercado @EmotionBrown @doubledoor Chicago joe!
@JacobJeffries mainly because it was on his neck.
Not forgotten RT @tholland76: @Jonathan_Tyler Don't forget that obnoxious guy who hit you with a pillow in Tulsa #idiot
I was given at least 15 demos &amp; records from younger bands this tour.  I guess the universe is telling me to start a label.
In Chicago I drank black coffee in Wicker Park &amp; met a crazy guy named Chicago Joe who tried to give me an Indian bone necklace.
In Nashville at the Red Door some big mouth breather doofus raging on steroids tried to pick a fight with me but got the bouncer instead.
Tour was a real cool time.  Had to wear my fingerless gloves &amp; a wool toboggan in Chicago &amp; St. Louis.
@ymereJSlayton thanks man.  We will definitely be around.
@Shelbya15Shelby kickass
@t1m0thyh4l3 thanks man
@MjForehand87 nah.  That was just delirium tremens.
@MjForehand87 these days I have no routine my friend. Usually just wonder around scoping things out.
@tuzedazegone u got it
@tuzedazegone check the link on my earlier tweet
Since we are live streaming tonight's show are there any requests you guys would like us to play?
We are live streaming our show from the @DoubleDoor tonight.  It's free to watch.  We start at 11 central time.  http://t.co/2JOsY4lfIj
Chicago tonight at the @doubledoor!
@oldenglishd313 yes but we are moving the show to the mint.
RIP Wayne Mills.  Met Wayne in Columbus GA earlier this year...  Tragic.
All the worlds a stage.
I keep reading stories about the "greatness &amp; genius" &amp; can't help think we've created an ego monster all for the sake of #entertainment.
I agree that Kanye is talented, but I get more entertainment observing his megalomania. I think it overshadows the music. Just an opinion.
Indianapolis tonight at the Rathskellar.  The venue was designed by a Vonnegut.  Not Kurt.  His gramps I think.
@DeannaPinkston here and ready to boogie
It's been a minute Chicago.  But I'm looking forward to your freezing cold yet somehow warm presence on Sunday.
Besides the bar fight I accidentally started Nashville was fantastic last night!
Doin the   ah Ah AH AH Ah ah   warm up routine.  #uniquenewyork

@scottkinnebrew lets go to business school together
@thetylerbryant in Nashville on Thursday if ur around let's get together
I need a fast food chain to start carrying kale.  Touring on burger fuel ain't quite enough.
It wasn't pretty.
I signed a lady's butt once in St. Louis.
Another time our (ex)tour manager gave us the wrong flight info and we missed a festival show with around 5k people.   #stlouis
I joke.  But St. Louis has alway been good to us.  Once we had to chain a loose trailer axle to the trailer door to make the gig.
St Louis I've missed you...a little. Tonite lets get together at The Mad Magician &amp; conjure up the spirit of joy &amp; happiness through music.
@kayseajames @EmotionBrown @JordanRCain no sir it does not.  None that are advertised!
@Kirby_Brown one of my all time favs.  Wim Wenders is a genius.
