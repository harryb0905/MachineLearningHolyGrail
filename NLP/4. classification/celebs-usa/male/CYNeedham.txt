@jrcelski D'Angelo
Sony canceling the release of "The Interview" is a brilliant piece of marketing. It will turn into the biggest cult classic of all time.
Big things happening with Cuba, I hope it helps the people down there and not just the government. Lots of potential in that country.
@danjansen94 Well done Dan!

Sad to be back in Boston for my grandfathers funeral. Happy to spend it with family I haven't spent a holiday with in years.
Spending thanksgiving on a plane will not stop me from enjoying some holiday cocktails. Those $7 drinks will only slow me down.
Thankful for everyone eating an MRE for Thanksgiving Dinner.
