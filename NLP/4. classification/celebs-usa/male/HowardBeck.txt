@jeauboux whatup...um, person with mildly disturbing twitter handle.
@jordansportz Appreciate it! My general approach is to let the guests speak their minds, tell their stories. If there's an appropriate place to interject or challenge them, I do. But it's a fine line, especially if the guest is someone I don't know as well.
@NbaNomad thank you!
@replytodahl This, I agree with.
@replytodahl Not sure I understand your point in the context of this discussion. Is this about ‚Äústandards‚Äù (in which case, do you think the NYT failed on this piece?), or is it about which opinions are ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of publication (a much more problematic stance)? The op-ed page is a town square.
@replytodahl OK, so let‚Äôs just do away with letters to the editor and decide the only opinions worth publishing in the opinion section are those written by staffers. Great.
@BKGlueGuys @BrooklynNets üò¨
Publishing an op-ed does not equate to endorsing the writer‚Äôs stance. At all. In fact, the reason for publishing op-eds and letters to the editor is to provide some balance/counterpoint. https://t.co/HbhnAHUYN9

Pet peeve: Conflating a writer (and their opinion) with the publication their work appears in. And in this case, a *guest op-ed writer* who is in no way affiliated with the paper. Come on, Nate. You know better. (That said, I share your disdain for the writer‚Äôs stance.) https://t.co/RofOfVSuPf

People are taking Shaq's reference to "guards" far too literally.   This discussion (and my story) is really about style/aesthetics of perimeter players, whether a traditional guard like MJ or a hybrid like LeBron (who plays like a guard). It's not a purely positional argument. https://t.co/MisT6v5krz
@mattkleinkeys @ZachLowe_NBA No, I knew exactly how you meant it. Appreciate it!
@DaveFinocchio Also, we can point to any number of modern-day players with an objectively more diverse and refined skill set than some players from the 60s. It's what the modern game demands. But if you tell someone Jimmy Butler is better than (insert HOFer here), you better be ready to brawl.
@DaveFinocchio This sounds perfectly reasonable, of course. Until someone comes back with, "Isn't the best player the one who Won the Most Rings/Made His Teammates Better/Dominated the Most," etc etc. I'm just saying, the two words are virtually synonymous, and it all becomes eye-of-beholder.
@mattkleinkeys üò¨üò¨üò¨
@thecity2 I can't heart this tweet enough.
My serious response, though: The best/greatest distinction you and others are making is why the GOAT debate is so fraught. It becomes about each fan's personal definition: Most rings? Most MVPs? Most skill? Most diverse skills? Biggest stats? Most success over longest period? https://t.co/uHlxUFz0qR
I find that time travel complicates every sports debate rather quickly. I wish Doc Brown could get that flux capacitor working. #yesimgoingtokeepmaking80smoviereferences https://t.co/uHlxUFz0qR
@KyleAllen1987 @SHAQ @JoelEmbiid @kaj33 No real reason. Story wasn't aimed at settling the debate, or listing every worthy candidate. But I will say that I ask about bigs in the GOAT debate, the replies are always Kareem, Russell and Wilt.
I mean, that's a given. Though I think the race with Captain Kangaroo is closer than the so-called experts acknowledge. https://t.co/Kskei4GO9i
@thttalguy appreciate it!
Absolutely, could make those distinctions. But in (non-sports) contexts, greatest &amp; best are essentially synonymous. "This is the best peach I've ever had." "This is the greatest peach I've ever had." "Beck's BOAT tweet was his best." "Beck's BOAT tweet was his greatest."  etc. https://t.co/JfQBIG6lAB
I'm not. And don't call me Shirley. https://t.co/8plpdeUnkq

Not sure what the substantive difference is here, but I do think it'd be fun if we all switched to "best," so we could debate the BOAT and use all these fun emojis. ‚õµÔ∏èüõ•Ô∏èüö§‚õ¥Ô∏è https://t.co/FslZpbI9hO

@EdgeofSports #sticktolattes?
@kmonarq7 @stevow245 WHATUP
@jgsiegel @HPbasketball True! You know what else is really hard? Getting the second star! But it is the GM's job and responsibility, and it's fair to hold them to account when they fail. Just saying it ain't easy.
@jgsiegel @HPbasketball Yes, everything counts. And it's sports -- the numbers are the numbers. No one is defending the Pelicans or saying it's unfair to criticize them. My point is it's a helluva lot more complicated and challenging than "they had 7 yrs" suggests. That's it.
@JoshNorquist @HPbasketball No one is arguing otherwise. I've been consistently pro-(players should decide their own destiny). Even in 2010, when everyone was shredding LeBron for daring to do so. That isn't the point of what I said.
@jgsiegel @HPbasketball "You had the whole time to build the winner around the guy" sounds reasonable. It ignores many other factors we discussed on the pod (and a few we didn't).
@HPbasketball I don't know if you have to be perfect. But the margin for error is much smaller than anyone acknowledges.
@HPbasketball And to all the folks responding here with various versions of, "Yeah, but Pelicans did all these stupid things..." Yes, of course. Nothing I said on the pod absolved them of their mistakes. Point is, the "Team A had 7 years with Star X" vastly oversimplifies/obscures reality.
@stevow245 whatup!

@dutch1970 They‚Äôre playing many, many players who are not in their future plans. Some of whom are the same age, or even older than Kanter. And some of whom they are actively trying to dump.
@RattoIndy @bykaren @ElliottAlmond @mercnews @NYTSports @GraceEGold Hi, Ray! I said some nice things about you on the twitters the other day. Please don‚Äôt kill me.
@sepinwall All true. My only point is there is no consistent, logical agenda at work here. So Kanter‚Äôs banishment can‚Äôt be viewed as simply a basketball decision. (And, frankly, it isn‚Äôt.)
@Bearded_Hippo They don‚Äôt have max cap room yet. They need to shed contracts. They‚Äôre trying to unload THJ and Lee.
@bykaren @ElliottAlmond @mercnews @NYTSports @GraceEGold I guess we both did OK. üò¨
@Bearded_Hippo It‚Äôs been reported in multiple places, and I‚Äôve tweeted about it.
@kalil_farhat Young guys, like Lance Thomas (four years older than Kanter) and Trey Burke (same age as Kanter)? Neither of whom have a future with the Knicks, either.
@Bearded_Hippo They are desperately trying to trade him.
@sepinwall THJ and Mudiay are both ball-dominant, low-efficiency scorers who don‚Äôt play D. And likely have no future with the Knicks, either. So, ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
@kalil_farhat Context, chief. Context. It kinda matters.
@Bearded_Hippo Have you seen Tim Hardaway Jr. play basketball?
@olusok Indeed they have. They‚Äôve also lost many with THJ. And Mudiay. And Vonleh. Shall I go on?
LOL https://t.co/h2zx68STZZ
@sepinwall Alan, if they cared about defense, they couldn‚Äôt play half their roster. But you do have to score and rebound occasionally to win. Anyway, their refusal to play Kanter clearly isn‚Äôt about basketball. (Also, they‚Äôre absolutely tanking.)
@PERMLpodcast üôè
And they refuse to play their best rebounder and inside scorer. https://t.co/5UVANcOKXF
@ElliottAlmond Too kind, Elliott. Thank you.
@HPbasketball I could have warned you.
@ElliottAlmond @bykaren @mercnews @NYTSports @GraceEGold Love this. As a fellow South Bay native who dreamed of working for the Merc (but never did), it was always a joy when my bylines magically ended up in that section.

@EricAsimov I‚Äôll leave at this: While DL might advocate a more measured approach - in deference to political realities - the case he presents is in fact a case for impeachment and removal. Whether it‚Äôs wise or practical to attempt it immediately is another matter.
@EricAsimov Not irritated, just puzzled. I don‚Äôt think we actually have a disagreement, except perhaps over the wording of my initial tweet ...
@EricAsimov Yes. He was also specific about the true goal (removal) and timing (ASAP). I don't think my original tweet in any way mischaracterized that.
@EricAsimov For political reasons, sure. Still, the overriding premise is that this presidency needs to end sooner than later. I'm not sure what we're actually arguing about here.

With marijuana being legalized in many locales, is it time for NBA to do the same? Adam Silver gave a really thoughtful analysis on this week's Full 48.  Plus, is tanking solved? Are the Suns staying? Is the age limit going?  https://t.co/co4mO5VigP

LeBron left his team. So did Carmelo and CP3, Kevin Durant and Paul George, Kyrie and Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, Dwight Howard, Gordon Hayward, LaMarcus Aldridge  All eyes now are on Anthony Davis.   Soon they be on Giannis.   But the Bucks have a plan.  https://t.co/oDHAXoYeUJ

Teams are still tanking (hello, Suns). Fans are still rooting for teams to lose (hello, Zion.) So is lottery reform a failure?  I put that Q to Adam Silver on the Full 48.   Also discussed: the age limit, the Suns' future and easing marijuana policy.  https://t.co/co4mO5VigP

Really, the only thing tonight's wacky trade saga was missing was @paulpierce34 tweeting a clip-art rocket ship.
@jkylemann Cool. Counter-snark withdrawn.
In a pre-Twitter world, the Brooks/Brooks confusion would have killed the trade before long before word leaked out. And we wouldn't have known until years later, as a humorous what-might-have-been anecdote from one of the GMs. "You know, we had this deal once..."

@StevePodsedly @KenCarman The sentence you're citing was in a section about the CURRENT CAVS TEAM, from a scene AT THE ARENA on game night. Not much glory left there w/out LBJ. But hey, much more fun to take the sentence out of context and extrapolate to make some tortured argument about how mean I am.
@ABaker_Sports Appreciate it.
@Mitchel_Inkrott The story made no claims about the Cleveland economy. Have a happy Thanksgiving.‚òÆÔ∏è
@Stan_TheMan27 Yes, a person said that. A person who lives and works in Cleveland. His voice was one of many. I made no claims or conclusions about the Cleveland economy. And the story was about much more than beer and t-shirt sales.
@Stan_TheMan27 It isn't, though. There are elements of the story that touch on downtown business, and a decline post-LeBron. That is 100% factual, and coming directly from the proprietors themselves. But it's not a story about the broader Cleveland economy, nor did I make any claims about it.

@StevePodsedly @KenCarman No, it portrayed the scene of one 10-hour span, on one Tuesday in downtown Cleveland. It's a series of vignettes, capturing a mood on a post-LeBron game night, nothing more. Story drew no conclusions, made no proclamations. That's all in your head.

@shawnmac_75 So, you're offended by news reporting and facts. Got it. Glad to clear that up.
@ChuckGobrowns Really solid case you've made there, chief.
@shawnmac_75 I'm going to block you. But before I do that, maybe you could actually string together a sentence or two with, you know, specific complaints and maybe some sort of rationale for those complaints? Or do you just like randomly spouting profanities and catch phrases?

@mgbode_WFNY All good, man.
@mgbode_WFNY You seem to be wildly misinterpreting something. I'm not sure what. But there's nothing in my story that would indicate lack of understanding/sensitivity toward Cleveland's championship drought and LeBron's role in ending it. To the contrary, in fact.
@MikeVacc Ibid.

Noteworthy: Two "non-staff" female referees are working tonight's NBA games -- Ashley Moyer-Gleich on Pacers-Wolves, Natalie Sago on Grizz-Jazz.  Both have worked in GLeague and WNBA. As "non-staff," they're in the pipeline to potentially become full-time NBA refs.

New Full 48! LOTS of NBA chatter, plus fall hair-styling tips, from the always-well-coiffed @ChrisMannixYS: * Celtics ready to take down Warriors? * Why LeBron could miss the playoffs  * Bucks, Jazz join the contenders * Thoughts on Kawhi, Butler, Luka  https://t.co/co4mO6cTFp
@lvl40cleric Yes, that could happen. In making preseason projections (which are, really, just educated guesses), I'm simply weighing the knowns vs. the unknowns/uncertainties. Generally speaking, the more uncertainty/volatility I see in a team, the less confidence I have. But it ain't science
@lvl40cleric Also, Kyrie absolutely looks 100% right now, has already been with BOS for an entire year and has given every indication he wants to be there long term. Only question is whether Hayward is all the way back, but Celts have ample depth at forward.
@lvl40cleric Loosely analogous, but very different situations. Raps have bet everything on Kawhi, who a) barely played last season, and b) didn't choose to be there. If he's anything less than MVP Kawhi, they're in trouble. They don't have the depth/talent (and room for error) that BOS does.
@McCallum12 I'm not sure she's ready, Jack. Maybe in high school.

So yes, I‚Äôm thrilled for Lee and wishing him the best in this new adventure. But as a writer (and loyal SI subscriber for 35 yrs), I‚Äôm sad we won‚Äôt be seeing his byline for the foreseeable future. The marketplace for great NBA writing remains rich. But it just got a little poorer
I‚Äôve often said (only half-joking) that Lee ‚Äúruined‚Äù stories. Meaning, if he wrote about Isaiah Thomas or Joakim Noah or Giannis, there was no point in anyone else writing that topic. In fact, I‚Äôd rather avoid it altogether. None of us was going to do it as well.
We have a lot of talented people covering this league. But Lee set the standard when it came to player profiles. I learned something from every story‚Äìnot just about the player, but about *how* to tell the story. He always found the best details and deployed them to great effect.
I couldn‚Äôt be happier for my former NYT teammate @SI_LeeJenkins ‚Äì one of the classiest, hardest-working people in the biz. And kudos to the @LAClippers for an inspired hire. But I have mixed feelings. Someone asked me today what I thought. ‚ÄúSaddened,‚Äù I said. Let me explain‚Ä¶

@AnonymousSportz It‚Äôs possible to share the concerns that Kaepernick has raised (I do) and still be skeptical of Nike‚Äôs motives (I am). One does not negate the other.
@AnonymousSportz If you‚Äôve followed me for any length of time, you would also have seen literally dozens and dozens of tweets and retweets about police brutality, and support for NFL players (and others) who have shined a light on these issues. You‚Äôre simply off base here, as you were with Mike.

@twithersAP Always a good choice.
@richeisen Also, just a generally lame song.
@gregbuechler I‚Äôd be happy to.
@FredKatz I hope he chalked it up to ‚Äúyouthful indiscretions.‚Äù
@gregbuechler Which is totally cool, but also very different than a member of the media using it.
Loved this piece by @SBondyNYDN, on the greatest NY streetball legend that ever lived. Highly recommend.  https://t.co/gw9lk3BKoY
I agree, National Media Reporter.  We don't address the general manager as "GM," or the team president as "Mr. President." Sincerely, NBA Senior Writer https://t.co/pVYdJfFjhE

@manraygun1 Nothing in the tweet criticized the ban. Nothing in the tweet advocated for plastic straws, or plastic anything. You made a bunch of bad assumptions that served your needs, fired off a judgmental tweet, doubled down and added insults. You're what's wrong with Twitter.
@LarryCoon You're worth every penny.
@DexterC73 üëä
@manraygun1 Blocking you for the pointless insult. But mostly for willfully misinterpreting my original tweet, which LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE understood to be cheeky observation and not a stance for or against plastic, you sanctimonious ass.
@manraygun1 Thanks for your sanctimonious and intentional misinterpretation of my tweet. Great work, skippy.

My fellow citizens: I think we need a compromise between the plastic straw ban and the paper straw replacement. Paper straws suck. (Or in this case, prevent it.) #banpaperstraws https://t.co/fLDRDlSCrq
