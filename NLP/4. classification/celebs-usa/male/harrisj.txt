@pilhofer @alanmclean @mattwaite @jeremybowers @hamman I like curling but I still get a minor panic attack seeing it on TV because I remember how we thought there was no way it would go into multiple overtimes and then it did
@alanmclean @pilhofer @mattwaite @jeremybowers @hamman Also, to be fair, the restrictions on the types of ads sold (no poitical content) and page-serving limits often there on other ads meant that election results pages hit house ads pretty quickly too
@alanmclean @pilhofer @mattwaite @jeremybowers @hamman Hey now. I remember you doing a tremendous amount of work to support ads here and there on other projects and then the only ads served were house ads (ie, they didn’t actually sell any ads)
@jeremybmerrill @jeremybowers @hamman Hey now. I was a TA for a compilers class even. Have I used it since? Nope. But still…
@macloo @albertocairo @pilhofer @donohoe @mattwaite @jeremybowers @hamman Oh I am sympathetic to IT too. I wouldn’t get fired if the site went down. But sometimes IT seems frustrating when it can’t explain WHY it has certain policies or restrictions

@waldojaquith @pilhofer @jeremybowers @hamman Of course, in federal agencies there are also statutory requirements that make it a bit harder to just launch something (the “fun” of ATOs and SIAs never gets old)
@mattwaite @pilhofer @jeremybowers @hamman Well it was a good combination of PCard + login cookie cracking code ported from Context + @alanmclean ‘s really great emulation of NYT page CSS that let us run NYT-looking apps without being in the NYT servers
@pilhofer @derekwillis @jeremybowers @hamman I do remember also when we had spent all this time working on election homepage stuff (was it the Jim and the mini-Jim) and they had sold a homepage takeover ad for Election Day that broke everything.
@derekwillis @pilhofer @jeremybowers @hamman I remember us asking where the server had gone and being told it was on a truck somewhere
@jeremybowers @hamman @pilhofer Fun fact: this was the machine I wrote and ran the @nytimes twitter account from and so it probably earned its extra expense many times over in terms of not having to pay a squatter for the account/social media cred
@derekwillis @pilhofer @jeremybowers @hamman I do remember that! For a while they didn’t know where the server was!
@pilhofer @jeremybowers @hamman Well, I don't remember how we got them to agree to the https://t.co/lc4LH37mPC host. One good thing about my Context experience is that I was able to port the login cookie decryption code I had ported to PHP to Ruby as well.
@pilhofer @jeremybowers @hamman Ah right. In our defense, wasn’t that in the era when there were only comments on 4 articles at any time?

@jeremybowers @hamman @pilhofer I also had asked for a Mac as my machine and my manager got me one without a fuss (when I showed up, it was a Windows machine), and I found out later that some in NYT IT hated me FOR YEARS because I was THE developer who asked for a Mac
@donohoe @jeremybowers @hamman I think AdX is really just what lasted the longest because it was too spaghetti to replace
@jeremybowers @hamman Has @pilhofer told you all how when we started INT, the NYT IT department decreed we’d have to run Rails apps on Solaris/x86 servers and deploy them using Solaris packages we’d email to them and we tried to get it working for 2 weeks before Aron just bought EC2 instead
@donohoe @jeremybowers @hamman @derekg I wasn’t able to port over AdX (hence, it lived on much longer) because the code was just too crazy, so we just wrapped it with an adapter and went with that.
@donohoe @jeremybowers @hamman I recall that it was really frustrating to work with databases and all. I’m sure @derekg has a lot of fun stories.
@jeremybowers @hamman Look, we all get attached to the software we build, but every engineer should know too that one day their code will be replaced and should be replaced.
@jeremybowers @hamman I'll have to find the notebook, but Oliver yelled at me in one meeting and accused me of destroying his dreams. But developers did not enjoy the language, it lacked even basic features (like nested hashes; forget JSON) and J&amp;O controlled everything.
@jeremybowers @hamman My first job at the NYT was to port some components (mainly for cookie parsing and ad server) so we could replace Context with PHP

@digiphile @BradMossEsq The Shire almost certainly has no NDAs.

@BradMossEsq @digiphile Is it a campaign NDA or a White House NDA? The former would be legal, right? Agreed that the latter should be challenged in court

@RonSupportsYou Thank you for defining NDA for others though.
@j_zimms Cerberus really just three dogs in a poorly-fitting trenchcoat
@RonSupportsYou Oh the campaign can do what they want. But there have been reports of White House staff being asked to sign NDAs which is likely against public records laws, etc. but hasn’t been raised in court. I want those challenges, but that’s not the campaign ones.
I hope the legality of the the NDAs they’re making government employees sign comes before a court https://t.co/0jnhekZqzm

@kleinmatic @MikeIsaac @pilhofer Yep. What I want to know is how writers for the Economist cite clippings when applying for jobs elsewhere
@MikeIsaac @pilhofer How about we let people keep their bylines but only as unguessable pseudonyms? (I’m just playing with ideas to see how bad they would be)
@MikeIsaac @pilhofer Is there a list of “why bylines?” out there already?
@robinsloan WHAT IS THIS MAGIC??
@_alastair @pilhofer I do wonder how people who write for the economist get hired elsewhere. How do you have clippings to share?
@gavinsblog @pilhofer NYT diffs has been an interesting example where that’s been a good thing to see but also people will latch onto conspiracy theories because a story’s words changed because of style or new things learned. For now it makes things harder for news orgs so…
@pilhofer Anyhow maybe a byline-free news org would be a disaster in other ways but if people want that hot take, let’s plan it out!
@pilhofer Theoretically the byline also is good for journalists because it lets readers get attached to particular reporters and makes orgs less likely to fire them but we’ve see how well that theory has worked out this week
@pilhofer Imagine the gutsiness of a news org that said “no bylines, no awards”. I imagine though they would not be able to hire because people would fear they couldn’t get hired elsewhere (if they could keep track of internal records all who worked on stuff…)
@pilhofer I described an issue with a team where they ranked developers based on points completed as being like picking a soccer team based only on who scored the most goals and what a nightmare that team would be. Bylines somewhat the same way I guess.
@pilhofer The byline is a long con, but one that the journalists have bought into completely. I sometimes wonder if it would be better to be rid of it entirely.
Going to use that as my new Twitter goal

How Reagan’s obsession with the headcount in the federal government led to an increasing reliance on contractors to keep headcount small as government grew led to many basic positions with no income and limited cushions to fall back on

Will that be enough to stop Knickers? Or will he continue to sweep up other stars and even entire galaxies in his perpetual expansion?
Eventually Knickers will become so large he will start to distort Earth’s gravitational field. In the long run, all that will remain will be a singularity where our solar system once was.
Once his legs grow long enough to reach the ocean floor, Knickers will be a colossus bestriding the globe. His black-and-white spotted emissaries will arrive with a simple choice to all nations: submit or die. Most will submit.
We can try to buy some time and abandon Australia to his bovine tyranny. The oceans will contain the Mad Max hellscape that Australia will descend into for a time. But only for so long.
He also doubles in size every 13 days. Soon he will be larger than a car, then a house, then a city block.
It is true though that he is too big to be slaughtered. Indeed, he cannot be killed. Knives bend rather than puncturing his flesh. He never ages. He will outlive us all.
Some truth about Knickers the giant cow: he’s not a cow but a steer (don’t try to milk him), and he’s not that much bigger than most Holsteins, but much larger than the other cow breed in the picture

@kleinmatic @dansinker Got my mind on Muunilinst and Muunilinst on my mind
@kleinmatic @dansinker I told my wife I was thinking of going as Manny Bothans, and she said I was too big a nerd for her
@kleinmatic @dansinker I am invited to a Lando Calrissian-themed costume party and I am seriously wondering if I should shave my head to go as Lobot
@kleinmatic @dansinker Did you know that 4-LOM’s name is supposed to be short for “4 Love of Money?”

For Halloween I guess, NPR interviewed that racist ghoul Michael Anton

I was at a hipster coffee shop in LA and all the patrons were talking about how they too have fake detective companies on their mothers' cell phone plans
Read this whole story. It’s amazing how stupid these people are and how much self-confidence they have they can pull off a smear job. https://t.co/IWcUZaoLrT
Ha, @JacobAWohl is even dumber than his regular fake tweets about the secret Trump-loving hipster coffee shop https://t.co/IWcUZaoLrT

@Nicole_Cliffe I will admit though that I read some of these small health updates in the voice of Poldark and Demelza mailing each other updates from the country and parliament :(
Anyhow, if you are a data journalist and want someone with minor experience but definite opinions to describe various ETL options, hit me up

“Oh you think a dataframe is your ally. But you merely adopted Spark; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn’t use SQL until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but STIFLING!” – hardcore data scientists to me
Have any of you used uTest for Scala? Is it easier for Scala newbies to use to write tests or should I stick with scalatest?
@kaitlinbdevine @Nicole_Cliffe Ha, he’s just so tedious that even when he’s right about something I want to do the opposite
@Nicole_Cliffe I just hope you’re back on your feet soon so I can get back to bitching about Poldark with you

She’s a black-widow assassin apparently who is into playing mind games and I think she did this guest role just to play a cheesy villain for fun
Aubrey Plaza is on the TV right now in this terrible crime show “Criminal Minds” and it’s the only thing making it tolerable

They’ll say the synagogue shooter was no Trump supporter while glossing over that he was radicalized by the same refugee fearmongering they’re trying to win an election with
@JK_Physics Okay, but how do you test the ProcessorGroups? Do you have a bunch of GenerateFlowFiles with different test situations and you manually hook up and run? Or is there a way to automate testing of a ProcessorGroup?

It really bothers me the list on the left doesn’t make a cute acronym and the last item is a noun and everything else is a verb  Still, how often do you get to see a chart with an arrow pointing to LETHAL https://t.co/I0Kaq3tZM0

@losowsky @hels “You know how much I love chocolate and brutally inhumane torture techniques…” MY GOD

@Nicole_Cliffe People like to complain about government travel booking being annoying, but they pay you an explicit per diem every day and give you an official and separate credit card that is used for booking hotels and reimbursed once you submit your travel voucher

@fhwang Maybe the real antagonist is society… but not Saudi society… nope, everything else but that
The Saudi hit squad was there to perform an immersive play where Kashoggi would get in a fistfight until one foe was revealed to be himself which would be a Luke-in-Yoda’s-cave moment but then someone accidentally switched the prop bone saw and then their instincts took over

@internetrebecca Is it bubble tea?
Your reminder that Coil’s “Unreleased Themes From Hellraiser” is the best horror movie soundtrack of all time
@mulegirl Before you watch it, ask Mike if he has any particular feelings about the character of Jordan
@mulegirl I mean you could contrast it with Weird Science which is prefty awful. There are actually some good bits in Real Genius and a surprisingly relevant message about tech
@mulegirl will there be a Surprisingly Problematic episode about Real Genius? Can I be on it?

These people are monsters who are incapable of treating others with the dignity and humanity they deserve.
Their cynical argument after Pulse was that they would keep out immigrants from Islamic countries that hated the LGBT community. What they really wanted was to keep all the discrimination action to themselves https://t.co/qHVMdC0TsJ https://t.co/fvjIEjZGeu
@dansinker Unrelated: I loathe the character of Pinkalicopus and am positive she grows up to be a Fox News commentator
When they start screaming about voter fraud, what they mean is that certain people shouldn’t be allowed to exercise their legal right to vote. Another sad low for the GOP’s racist wrecking ball against the pillars of civil society.

@Nicole_Cliffe “Maintained frame 99% of the time” is some weird way of describing “pretended I was not a human being”

So yes, the flavor profile for these almonds has hints of almond in it

@jeremybowers My son’s science grade went from B to E because he was out sick on Friday and had a Z (zero that can be turned in) on a lab. He is doing the makeup this week. I had to take a breath to figure it out.
@jeremybowers So Montgomery County has a parent portal where you can see your child’s grades when teachers enter them and their current grade. It is terrifyingly volatile at the beginning of the year.

Maybe Montgomery County is like Lake Wobegon and almost all middle school students are above average
It could very well be there is an issue with the data or that there is not much differentiation at the middle school level for gifted &amp; talented of course
