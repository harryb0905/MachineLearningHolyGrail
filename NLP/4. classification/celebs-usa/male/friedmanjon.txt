1. GOP elected and drastically cuts taxes for the wealthy which leads to a boom followed by a crash.  2. Democrat gets elected and slowly fixes economy over the span of eight years. 3. Voters don't think it was fixed fast enough and elect GOP to get the economy going. 4. Repeat
It was impressive how that tiny sip of water cured that horrendous cotton mouth.
Does that mean last year's Sexiest Man Alive got less sexy?
Don't know about you but I trust the guy that made up a University and conned people out of their money while promising to teach them things they never learned to make a tax bill that's fair for everyone and not just himself and mega billionaires.
