@chrisricewriter I can't.
@chrisricewriter cool. I dig a mystery. Thank you.

Good for @Delta, whose statement on allowing phone calls in flight can be summed up as "hell no."
I don't remember the part of this movie when Kate Winslet steals Eli Wallach's Oscar and pawns it on Santa Monica Boulevard.
her first problem was sleeping with a guy named Jasper. Unless it was the old man from The Simpsons.
thank goodness for Nancy Meyers, because when there's a knock on the door it's Jude Law looking for sex.
uh-oh. The Holiday is on. Can anyone explain why Kate Winslet would trust Cameron Diaz to take care of her dog?

A must read RT @nytimes: Romney Aides Scratch Their Heads Over Eastwood’s Speech http://t.co/5zgiKIFU
Eastwood story isn't about him talking to an empty chair, as strange as that is, it's about a natl campaign squandering important airtime.
so who's gonna play Clint in HBO movie about 2012 campaign? I say go big, go Busey.
Eastwood speech might have played fine at 7pET, but 10pET is a convention within a convention. Huge distraction.
even Dan Rather, who knows a thing or two about being eccentric on TV, says Clint speech was bizarre. http://t.co/il7t6Y7M
@jimacostacnn I don't think people are really judging Clint, they're judging Romney camp's decision to put him on in prime
Btw, we're likely to hear more from Clint in weeks ahead - he has a new movie to promote. He'll surely be asked about RNC.
@jacktame he's 82
Who'd have guessed this episode of Golden Girls guest-starring Mickey Rooney would only be the night's 2nd oddest Hollywood legend moment.

@mmhastings takes one to know one.

Neil Patrick Harris is now breaking his dinner up into sub-courses and I am now trying to fit my head into my blender.
There are not enough sitcoms nowadays with fake flashbacks about senior citizens at nudist resorts.
By the way, Twitter, in case you forgot, Neil Patrick Harris is rich and ate way better than you tonight.
uh-oh, Golden Girls Valentine's episode is on. I might have to live tweet this, starting w/ the fire escapes hanging from Bea Arthur's ears.
Only an hour left on Valentine's Day and I'm still trying to close the deal with this bag of Reese's Cups.
so the best Valentine's Day card I got contained the words "pantsless chimp" and came from a married lady.

RT @andersoncooper: Tonite on @AC360 primetime exclusive, R&B singer Kelly Price talks about singing w/ #WhitneyHouston in final performance
JHud was incredible but #Grammys should have done more. They had 24hrs to do a tribute package. I'm a TV producer, I know it can be done.
Grammys have delayed the Whitney tribute to a borderline appalling point. Get to it. And it better be more than one song.
Wow. Adele. Just wow. That's how it's done.
this Taylor Swift performance is like one of those exhibits that suddenly comes to life when u enter a room in Epcot Center
Hey, Sir Paul. Can't But Me Love. HIT IT.
I'm glad some people on Twitter enjoyed the Beach Boys "performance." Please tell me what channel you're watching.
Instead of this trainwreck they should have just played the Beach Boys episode of Full House.
oh for CRYING OUT LOUD, some reunions just should not happen.
@pbsgwen I was the same. Amazing song. Huge talent.
@rachelsklar I switched to The Proposal  starring Ryan Reynolds & Sandra Bullock during Chris Brown.
sorry, Reba (who is apparently now a one name celeb) but Kelly Clarkson & Jason whoever are no Streisand & Diamond.
No pressure, Adele.
sorry Grammys, I love The Boss, but huge mistake not starting with cold open Whitney tribute.
If you've never seen/heard Whitney's performance of the Star Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl, google that now.
Wow. Stunned to hear the sad news of Whitney Houston's passing. She was a peerless talent and an American original.
TLC stands for a lot of things but "The Learning Channel" ain't one of them.

yikes. three virgins on a group date go right for the vibrating arcade game. #BuyAGalDinnerFirst
can someone explain to me what a "reclaimed virgin" is? Particularly one who says she's had sex with 7 boyfriends.
is she trying to steal his gold fillings? #VirginDiaries
was that a wedding kiss or Hannibal Lecter in a tuxedo?
wow his date is DOWN for the challenge! #CheckPlease #VirginDiaries
let's be honest, America, the 35-year-old virgin has a date on Friday night, which is more than most of us can say.
did the Virgin Groom just sing a few bars from the Sound of Music during wedding rehearsal?!
so just to be clear, her opener on the 1st date was "what's your timeline on getting married and having kids?" #yikes
ugh who would EVER go to 23 weddings in one lifetime, never mind one summer? #RatherStickMyHeadInABlender
so far we've learned that the 35-year-old virgin likes cats, cooking fudge & discussing his virginity WITH HIS MOM.
OMG Virgin Diaries on TLC. Did she just say "do foreplay?"
remember, a week from tonight is @CNNHeroes 8pmET. A incredible tribute to everyday people changing the world. Pls watch.
Those defending the school denying enrollment to an HIV + honors student should read the Americans w/ Disabilities Act.
@us100k We have done plenty of research, thank you. A trust does not trump federal law.
@us100k no, you're wrong. Read the Americans with Disabilities Act. Private schools are in no way exempt. cc: @MiaFarrow

tomorrow is @glaad's Spirit Day. Wear purple to remind #LGBT youth that there is nothing wrong with who they are.
Unless you are on your way to play 18 holes of golf in a driving rain, you do not need an umbrella that big.
Um lions, tigers & bears on the loose in Ohio. No joke. Sad & scary on multiple levels. http://t.co/LS0HxQTK
tonight's #CNNDebate was intense. Really intense. Recap on #AC360 now.
Wow. Just wow. #CNNDebata

Rick Santorum says Saturday Night Live is "bullying" him. I can't quite wrap my head around that.
we're hosting a #GOP debate tomorrow night in Vegas. Submit a question http://t.co/0x2d3vsd & watch #CNN 8pmET
@David_Gergen he told David Gregory on Meet the Press that he was joking. Not sure that makes his problem go away.

I went thru all the setup steps on my #iPhone4S & it works on wi-fi, but "no service" from #ATT anyone else?
@patkiernan Pat let me know if u r having trouble getting phone "activated." I went thru all steps on my mine but still seeing "no service"
I just told my friend Anne's new iPhone to "go f*** yourself" and, no joke, the voice command robot replied "Oooh."
how long is the honeymoon period before people start using their #iPhone4S on the toilet? #DontActLikeUWerentThinkingThat
ever feel like you're hallucinating and then realize you're just watching a preview for a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie?

I love the New Yorkers who are like 90 years old and still put on a suit and tie to go to Dunkin Donuts. #FredMertz
Ugh, tonight I'm the guy running around his apartment in pajamas waving a rolled up New Yorker shouting "show yourself, mosquito!"
Wow, THAT was a TV moment. @Cher cheering on @ChazBono at #DWTS. The true unconditional love & support of a parent.
wow Ricki Lake and poor man's Zac Efron were outstanding. #DWTS

@AWMooneyCNN just when I thought your job couldn't get any cooler.
@RyanLizza absolutely. I couldn't care less about voice commands. Bring on the 4G.
frigging iPad autocorrect. I was trying to write "ice cream," not "ice crematorium."
@NiaVardalos whatever the award, I know u deserve it. Not just sayin that cuz I want 1 of those buttermilk pies next visit.

my favorite line today, from @thedailybeast "he (Herman Cain) sits...nursing a morning glass of white wine."
Patti Stanger really needs to stop talking.
I don't care how many nipples are flying around on #DWTS. They're each more talented than that 2nd tier Kardashian.

The Lion King was number 1 at the box office this weekend?! What in Rip Van Winkle hell is that all about?

are John Goodman & Laurie Metcalf aware of what Roseanne is up to with that chainsaw?
@moonfrye I long for the day when Roseanne wore underwear. PS - miss you xo
@ColeEscola happiness begins and ends with Tyne Daly.
so I think the takeaway from Roseanne's Nuts is that she needs half as many shotguns & twice as many underpants.
Sweet mother of ABC residual checks, who the hell are these people in Roseanne's life?!
@tiffanyrinehart such an amazing freak show!!
so there's some random dude, a guy I'm calling hippie Kato Kaelin, who lives in a tent on Roseanne's farm. And she naps in his tent.
@tiffanyrinehart um, there's a long list of entertainment legends who have flashed their crotch at you.
OK, so the headlines so far are that Roseanne doesn't mind crotch shots & she shouldn't be allowed to drive a tractor.
Hmm, is it just me or is Roseanne not wearing underwear?
1 minute in & I'm addicted to the insane new Roseanne show on Lifetime. Tho I wish she weren't running around with a shotgun shooting pigs.
recovering from 5mile 3am walk with my bestie @KathyGriffin. Laughed so hard we almost didn't have energy for donuts.
Wow, whatever Roseanne was wearing on Letterman, I want two of them. #KimonosAreForLovers #BillowyDrapes #StevieNicks
Ted & Mary rock RT @RedCarpetTeam Multiple Emmy winner (@MSteenburgen's hubby) Ted Danson joins cast of 'CSI' in series regular role
does Rep Michelle Bachmann's husband practice discredited "reparative therapy" for gays? 10pmET #AC360
haircut delayed, my usual barber is off today. Apologies to my #AC360 colleagues for my vintage Pat Benatar look.
Victoria & David Beckham gave their daughter the middle name "Seven." They're officially an episode of Seinfeld.
@RealClearScott really? That seems long. But I guess such short seasons, and spread out, too. Not really like eleven full TV seasons.
@fieldproducer is "chuffed" good or bad?
Sweet mother of fleas, please give money to the @ASPCA so they can stop running these homeless dog ads!
Clint Eastwood, Tyne Daly & a whole lotta whoop ass in The Enforcer on AMC_TV. Saturday night gift from heaven. #single
wow, my dog does NOT like it when I talk to her in my Carol Channing voice. #GoodbyeDolly
nothing like the quiet streets of #NYC on a crisp, clear Saturday morning. #OKThatWasNice #BackToBedTillNoon
Betty Ford's legacy lives on; giving hope to countless people battling substance abuse.

my DVR is such a malfunctioning piece of crap, I'd use it as a door stop but it'd probably mess that up, too.
as if I needed another reason to love #MerylStreep. Trailer for her Margaret Thatcher film http://tinyurl.com/6f8wy6d
@JanineRhodes I'd never eat instant mashed potatoes.  We'll go out for the real thing.
@tiffanyrinehart you know it, honey. memories...
11:30 on a Wednesday night. Time to run out for mashed potatoes and deodorant. #LivingTheDream
@vincentbuzzetta your show is great. You just need half as much fondant and twice as much swearing.
@MSteenburgen trailer looks great! Congrats, Mary.
@MarleeMatlin that episode is genius!
@oliverrthornton how long are you doing Priscilla? I have to see the West End production.
RIP Cy Twombly
cab driver on phone, reached to backseat, handed me paper & said "Can you write down a number for me?" #HowBoutIJustDrive
Happy 4th of July. Easy on the booze and fireworks.
just saw @PriscillaUS on #Broadway. Fabulous music, great performances & amazing non-stop fun. Run, don't walk.
sad apartment building rite of passage. Nice elderly lady down the hall passed away. Despite popular belief, NYC is full of kind neighbors.
loved #LarryCrowne. Terrific script by my pal @NiaVardalos & fab @TomHanks. Julia Roberts nails it as charming boozebag.
I fully support turtles laying eggs & stopping traffic on JFK airport tarmac. Unless I'm on a flight about to take off.
watch the #ridiculist at the end of #AC360 That @AndersonCooper has high standards for music. Don't get him started.
leave it to @WeTV to come up with a reality show about cakes on Staten Island. I fully support any ferry ride that involves frosting.
Where's Larry Hagman?! RT @BravoTV They’re young, hot, single! Meet the cast of our newest show #MostEligibleDallas http://t.co/6tO9zhS

oh no, the last half hour of Marley & Me. #Tissues #SweetMotherOfGodMakeItStop
nothing like starting my day reading an article with the words "one night stand," "crabs" and "Florence Henderson."
RT @KathyGriffin: tonight we're all New Yorkers! Straight & gay alike, let's all celebrate marriage #equality. The right side of history!
history made in #NewYork. State senate passes marriage #equality. 6th state to legalize #samesexmarriage.
amid much anticipation, marriage #equality bill will be voted on tonight by the #NewYork State Senate. #LGBT
still trying to wrap my head around #Whitey Bulger capture. No way to fully describe how big a deal this is in Boston.
OMG, as a Boston native, I'm beyond words speechless at Whitey Bulger's capture. Never thought I'd see the day.
any day I hang out with @NiaVardalos and don't end up spilling Ouzo on myself is a good day. #BigFatGreekWednesday
Uh-oh, set your DVRs. @KathyGriffin is "Gurrl Down" on @BravoTV 9pmET Wednesday

I could watch @MarthaStewart talk about compost piles all day. And she does not need our help, thank you very much.
no, you're not hallucinating. 2012 presidential campaign is already off & running. 1st NH #debate at 8pmET #CNN
worse than couples who dress alike: couples who dress their Italian Greyhounds alike.
is it just me or do most life insurance ads involve people eating hors d'oeuvre and ignoring a dead guy's family?
March of the Penguins meets Boogie Nights. Turn on #AC360 now.
Sweet mother of Pearl, people. Turn off your damn #cellphones when you're on a plane. http://tinyurl.com/6z2knts

apparently I'm the only person who didn't know that Ice-T is married to Coco. #ThingsULearnWatchingHLN
Ugh, it's going to be 98 degrees today. And not in the Nick Lachey kind of way.
day off from work. with my pal @KathyGriffin, looking gorgeous in Dior, en route to Letterman @Late_Show #DaveRocks
my dog keeps bouncing around and wagging her tail. She's either drunk or she had money on #Nadal. Or both.
Happy birthday to @AndersonCooper. As always, I'll celebrate by drinking at my desk & stealing paper clips from ur office.
not often you see an intervu like @WolfBlitzerCNN had w/ Rep. #Weiner. Anderson, Wolf, Borger & Begala on #AC360 10pET
