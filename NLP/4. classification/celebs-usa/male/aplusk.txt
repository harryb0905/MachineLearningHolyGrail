@glennbeck More live are lost in 7 weeks in the US to guns than 7 years in the Iraq war. Let’s make this about data Glenn.
@glennbeck No really let’s make it about data https://t.co/uOUpRWfik2
@glennbeck Guns are used in 74% of recorded Homicides and 87% committed by youth. The 3rd leading cause of death for children 10-19. So says the CDC. Again let’s make this about data!!!!
@glennbeck Let’s please make this a data conversation. https://t.co/TvdvqvffN7
@glennbeck 1. It’s only illegal if you take possession of the weapon. I’ve yet to take possession. As stated “I’ve never fired it, and not sure if I ever will.”

If your argument is that these reforms won’t change anything I simply ask “What problems will be the reforms create?” No one is taking your guns. Gun Reform Now!
Protect your home. Shoot for sport. Go hunting. Support Gun Reform Now! Support mental health initiatives now! @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @BenSasse @CoryBooker this is about protecting all our people. #lovethyneighbor
The right to bear arms was built on the notion that we could form a militia to fight back against an unjust government. Is that realistic today? A nuclear bomb is an arm. Do you have the right to own that? Gun Reform Now!! No one is taking your guns.
We all have a right to freedom unless you do something to lose that right and end up in jail. We all have a right to guns unless you do something to lose that right and get your gun taken away!  Gun Reform Now!!!
Beef up ATF. Prevent hostile mentally unstable people from getting guns!  Support our veterans that are returning from war with resources! Gun Reform Now!
ATF needs to require background checks. Improve state and federal systems to vet owners and buyers. Tie mental health records to purchase of fire arms. Increase funding for mental health. Focus AG (when we get one) on gun trafficking and illegal acquisition. Gun Reform now!
Support mental health care initiatives!!! Gun Reform Now!
Nobody is taking your gun or my gun. I can still go hunting. I can still protect my home. Gun Reform Now!
Love thy neighbor! Gun Reform now!
. @IvankaTrump  your brother in law was at that birthday party. He could have just as easily been a victim. You go to synagogues you could be a victim! Talk to your dad! Plead with your dad! Let this be your legacy! Gun Reform now!
The BS rhetoric around arming more people to protect others is just that, BS!  Armed people got killed last night! Gun Reform now!!!
I grew up a hunter, I worked at a gun club pulling trap growing up. No body is taking your guns!!!  Gun reform!!!!!  Let it be a test. Your electorate doesn’t want to die when they go to church or a concert or a bar!
My wife threw me a birthday party this year at the Borderline. Only reason we are alive is the shooter chose a different night. My heart goes out to the victims. I’ll say it again... Gun Reform Now! Politicians need to stop standing behind the dollar &amp; Protect the people!

@lostapwbm0 Addressing mental health is not lost on me.
@RealAmericanPit Ok what’s your fix?  I’m glad to see you are identifying it as a problem.
@RoslynTaber1962 I have a kid that goes to school. I’m qualified!
@theOs90 @arshyeso @B3LIK3BLAK3 This is like saying “plane crashes happen so why have fAa oversight” no law will irradiate anomalies but we are no longer witnessing anomalies. This is a clear cut patterned behavior.
@metboi08 I did grow up hunting. I have no intention to ban all fire arms. I think there is a huge unaddressed mental health issue and a huge unaddressed gun issue. Solutions to the issues aren’t simple but are necessary.

10,000 jobs is nothing to scoff at, @BilldeBlasio #uberNYC
@chewy106 an important community indeed but paying politicians to suppress competition is not servicing themselves or the community at large
NYC council member explain to teachers who drive #uber to subsidize their income that they won't have a job cause U took 25k from a taxi co
This isn't a conservative or liberal debate it's about politicians representing their personal interests and not their community. #uberNYC
Until the impact of ALL 2.7m vehicles are considered, any cap imposed on new for-hire vehicles remains completely arbitrary
Here are the facts @BilldeBlasio make a data driven decision!!!! http://t.co/pG3meiK13Q
Vote to keep #Uber moving in New York
The residents of New York need access to affordable and reliable transportation.
Why does this bill completely ignore the impact of buses, bicycles, pedestrians and of course yellow and green cabs on NYC roads?
If slow average speeds in Manhattan is something that needs to be fixed, why did the city LOWER the speed limit thru Vision Zero this year?
Limiting new for-hire vehicle licenses and taking away jobs from New Yorkers is not the answer.
De Blasio to business groups: Stay out of #Uber debate – or else http://t.co/XQGxkiImuM
"The “problem” is economic growth, not Uber — and the solution is better public transportation…" https://t.co/cBZPBwF5Aw
Rationale for this legislation and its methodology are inherently flawed #UberNYC
Proposed bill will result in longer wait times, higher prices, and less reliable service for riders. #deBlasioUber http://t.co/5R2ToNhEuY
Please do not prejudge the solution before fully examining the question, Mayor @BilldeBlasio #UberNYC
Proposed bill singles out 1% of the 2.7M cars+trucks on NYC roads every day, ignores buses, bikes, pedestrians + yellow or green cabs.
“Despite past claims that the proposed cap is designed to deal w/ congestion, the word appears just once…” #UberNYC https://t.co/cBZPBwF5Aw
This bill would limit #UberNYC'S ability to add supply to ~200 new cars over the next year, vs. the 10K that are needed to keep up w/ demand
Mayor @BilldeBlasio + the City Council are supporting NYC bills that take jobs away from over 700 ppl who had signed up to drive since 6/15
Mayor @BilldeBlasio supports NYC bill that destroys job opps for over 10K NYers by placing strict limits on new for-hire vehicle licenses

#GoodForRatings #TrafficSpike #WelcomeToShockJournalism
U r all right and I'm on the wrong side of this ultimately. I just wish journalists were held to the same standards as public figures.
@karaswisher @pando @TechCrunch @Uber I'm as shady as they come Kara. You know that!
This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...
To be clear I speak for my self not @Uber
So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source.
Questioning the source needs to happen... Always!
Everyone is guilty and then tasked to defend themselves publicly.
Rumors span the globe before anyone has an opportunity to defend them selves.
I believe we live in a day were the first word has become "the word"
We are all public figures now!  “@RussADeCastro: @aplusk Depends if they are a PUBLIC FIGURE, like you, or not. http://t.co/ZFemzZshxV”
What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist? @pando @TechCrunch @Uber

@PritiMind I think we all benefit via duplicative subsidies reducing gov spending &amp; having children surrounded by educated mentors
@mitchbytes I was actually thinking for people who haven't payed into social security that could do extended jury duty for eligibility.
@lilemmysmom probably start by going to a couple asst living facilities and asking questions.
@HeierFireMama @ktjatty @jshy are these state regulatory issues? Is it subsidized?
How is it financially set up? “@jshy: @aplusk we have that model in West Seattle and it is a huge success”
@kathymfish true maybe best for select centers with rebate costs associated.
Should we set up after school daycare centers at assisted living facilities? Seems like a win win.
