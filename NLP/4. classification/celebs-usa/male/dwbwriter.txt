@drspacejunk Not yet but I‚Äôll keep you updated. :-(
@Gradelink Are there any plans for Google calendar integration ?
@drspacejunk Bereft, which I never expected.
While our world falls apart, I love everything about the Mars Daily Weather Report provided by the @NASAInSight lander. https://t.co/AVqWZjBY5a
@dsfpspacefl1ght Guess I‚Äôll have to come to you then! üòÄ
@dsfpspacefl1ght Will you be there?
Alita: Battle Angel was fantastic. Like the original Star Wars, it left me with that same sense of longing to know more about the world and its heroes. If we get an Empire Strikes Back-level follow-up, it could be the modern sci-fi epic the Matrix films almost were. #Alita
@MarkHarrisNYC I think the interior designer was going for an IHOP Gothic aesthetic.

@davidhitt HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH
@davidhitt This is going to be another V‚ÄôGer situation isn‚Äôt it?
is opportunity really dead, or is nasa afraid to reveal what its cameras have found? thank goodness the little rover has a laser to defend itself. curiosity, transform and roll out.
@michaelpfreeman Well they had to limit people to make room for the big bonfires of books.
It‚Äôs almost like Mars One was a Ponzi scheme, and that the only way its people would ever have touched red dirt is if Mars collided with the Earth. Mars One leaves behind a legacy of slick graphics, lightened wallets, and a public whose faith in human exploration is undermined. https://t.co/8DpPoMdn2m

@michaelpfreeman Let's also not forget that before Morning Joe [nails across blackboard] was St. Joe of Antitrumplandia, his was the only news show that gave Trump serious and fawning airtime and coverage. He is to Trump what Trump is to war with North Korea. "Saving us" from a fire he started.
@megmaker Congratulations! A very well-deserved honor -- your work is superb.
@arawnsley @AaronNagler This remains the best summation of my feelings about Star Wars post-ROTJ. https://t.co/kKrdYAk9sc
@arawnsley @AaronNagler Yes! Even Lucas felt that pressure with the prequels. (E.g., Quigon should have been Obi-wan, but Lucas got cold feet, not wanting to ruin the Gandalf-like figure we remember him as. Same with Yoda, who is reduced to stating the obvious in every PT film. Yoda can‚Äôt be wrong!)
@AaronNagler YES! Also because I‚Äôve never actually said these words aloud, I liked Solo and regret that it wasn‚Äôt given a chance. (I feel like my only other SW friend, @arawnsley, should be included in this chat.)
@PaulSzoldra I‚Äôve not been there in a long time, but I bet Green Bean **still** hasn‚Äôt mastered a no-foam-half-caff-one-pump chai latte with soy. It‚Äôs like they think we are fucking animals.
@PaulSzoldra Dude they don‚Äôt even have a third Burger King there yet. Have a heart.
@AaronNagler A monk in the Old West. (Hell, Tatooine is all desert!) Confined there for the rest of his life. Honor bound to do good. Protect the innocent in a hive of scum and villainy. How does he go from an invisible presence to a reputation as a ‚Äúcrazy old wizard‚Äù?
@AaronNagler I was kind of hoping for a spaghetti western style. But as long as they keep the Jedi out of this one (a la the superb Rogue One) I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic. Actually maybe a Man With No Name **series** starring Ewan McGregor as Obiwan on Tatooine would work even better. Oh yes.
@erinentrada @OrivetGenetics Owl. Small fluffy bear. Axolotl.
@dixondaver hey man this is a smart move to address the critical shortage of static displays. the commander is sick to death of that fucking F-86 out front.
@KateSanner @onepeloton Wait @onepeloton advertises on Tucker Carlson? Shame on you. You are a company devoted to inclusiveness and the betterment of oneself, and you spend my monthly subscription to subsidize a racist hatemonger whose raison d'√™tre is to divide and destroy? How do you justify this?
@arawnsley How have I gone my whole life without knowing this is even a thing? Honestly I never really let go of the ninja dream and though I don't have any actual skills in the martial arts, I am a fast learner and have good people skills.
@arawnsley Ninja here. At the time it seemed like it would be a steady gig. Oh man I would wear all black with a red sash and I designed some wicked throwing stars and
Hi, I‚Äôm a writer. You may remember me from such movies as ‚ÄúThat is a good idea for a book thank you for offering to let me write it for you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you could be a writer too if only you had the time,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThank you for the one star Amazon review because the box was damaged.‚Äù https://t.co/kw0h7TLDUS
@thatsjhendricks The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has actually imaged the Apollo landing sites from space. https://t.co/1ZS4HoNIVl
@LukeEpplin I cannot wait to read it.
@LukeEpplin No way man‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this.
@panther_modern And a total professional it seems. He brought 100% to every role, even the minor ones that lesser actors would have phoned in for the paycheck. I admire talent, but I just respect the hell out of a strong work ethic.
@harriet_brettle Thank you!
@zebedol Yes I was there! Thank you!
Hello! I am very proud of this story I wrote about the extraordinary Dr. Kivelson. I hope you read it and enjoy. Buy a copy of the paper today too ‚Äî it looks sooo good in print. https://t.co/YHV5F7daAB
