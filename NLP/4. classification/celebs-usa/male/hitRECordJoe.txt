If you were thinking of doing some writing today, I really think you should do it. Even if it's just a random little thing. I would encourage you to go for it.  And you don't have to post it anywhere either. It can just be for you.  I think it'll make you feel good.
Dr. King once said "The time is always ripe to do what is right."  That's something that we should all think about ‚Äî and not just today. But every single day.   What can each of us do to make things better in this world? I encourage you to carry that question with you. https://t.co/TjCNPBaBwA

I know I‚Äôve had moments of really loving music in some kind of pure transcendent presence. I get there sometimes. Or I have. But not tonight. Tonight I‚Äôm barely listening to the music. Because not only am I overthinking it. I‚Äôm fucking writing about my overthinking on twitter.
But even if I were alone, I‚Äôd still be worried about whether my musical selection at the moment means I‚Äôm cool or not. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm capable of putting on music without judging myself for it. Or applauding myself for it.
I wonder if he thinks the music is cool. I wonder if he thinks I‚Äôm cool. I wonder if he thinks I‚Äôm trying to look cool by putting on this music. I wonder if I am, in fact, trying to look cool. I wonder if I would have put something else on if I were alone?
Just put an album on in the car. I‚Äôm immediately self conscious about it. I‚Äôm not alone in this car. A lovely Nola native named Mike is driving. He‚Äôs been driving me to and from work on this movie. Mike‚Äôs not a judgey guy. Why can‚Äôt I just enjoy music in the presence of company?

Thanks to all you guys for chiming in w/ your instruments. Couldn't get to replying to each and every one of you, but I'm gonna point you to this page that's got a bunch of songs you could add on to. We're seriously looking for any and all instruments: https://t.co/20xnV6mLsF
Yes! Not joking. 100% yes. And I would love it if you'd clap along to this track: https://t.co/rEowIYPBae https://t.co/lzy2ODONI4
Really glad you asked for ideas. One thing I'd say is just try to experiment. Don't go into it thinking you need to always write or play full pieces. Just do little parts if you want. Then add on bit by bit. Don't be afraid to take a break and start over again. :) https://t.co/iaYX3wO5to
