Thanx to Clearwater for Youth for tonight's T-shirt. They insure no child is kept from playing the sport they love. http://t.co/wcI2s6PQlY
Lot of soft contact tonight. The wild pitch was our buddy we just couldn’t get enough of them.

Offensively we’ve been challenged this year, but today their guy was that good. We have to be the 2007 Rockies the rest of the way.

Today's t-shirt goes to the Centre for Women. A little hat tip to the Rogers Centre. http://t.co/2QBxlG6hHw
I believe our protest will be upheld. Pitcher was on the rubber, batter in the box. Timing has nothing to do with the price of tea in China.
Smyly had everything going tonight. Truly artistic performance. That was the best outing I've seen by a Ray in this ballpark.
Tonight's charity is Always Wear Your Seatbelt. I used to make deals with my players to wear ours. So important. http://t.co/hl2IqY0HIu
I never ever want to coach the aggressiveness out of a player. Can try to coach out the mental mistakes, but I want risk takers.
Today you could see why the Rays have been built on pitching for so long. Interesting game to be talked about ad nauseam for days to come.
Thanx to RU 4 Children in Ft Worth for the Tee. Their aim: nourish the hungry, inspire the broken, connect the world. http://t.co/DFCnN3F1wY
We had the pedal to the metal, but we’ve stubbed our toe. We need to go on another run. We’re capable of it, but we can't wait.

Our players have done a wonderful job of understanding this moment. I anticipate our young starters to work their game to a higher level.
No fun losing a David Price. Hate it. But we have to do what is best for our group. Continue to move it forward and that's what we've done.

Middle innings tonight reminded me of 2008. J.P. Howell was played by Beliveau and Balfour played himself. Then it was Jake and the Box.
Send in your charity’s T-shirt &amp; I will wear it at a postgame press conference. I’m an L+. Send c/o Rays PR, Tropicana Field, St. Pete 33705

The popup that Evan caught was the highest one I've ever seen outdoors. That would've punctured our roof.
David is pitching even better than he did in Cy Young year 2012. So it's time to start that discussion again.
Impressed with the game we played tonight after that many days off. Good ABs up &amp; down lineup, high energy in dugout.
We’re going to have to be ready on a nightly basis. No mulligans left, but if we can keep our current vibe, we’re going to make some noise.
With Kiermaier, Guyer and Forsythe playing more, we closed out the first half building up the speed component that we didn’t have earlier.
No it's not 80s. Our medicine man Bobby Henry gave me some authentic garb. He's a wonderful man. Love having him here http://t.co/u4YtVUyHwX

@artofsoundtampa shall...and for those who are interested...this guy is the sound artist !  Shop appropriately named..
To go to Balt, NY and Detroit and go 9-2 - based on where we have been - really speaks for our resiliency.

It's a different bus driver on a daily basis. With us, it's not about just one guy.
Closed w/ Grant tonight because I saw him walking his grandmother thru the hotel lobby today. It was an impressive moment. Liked his karma.
I wish Joel could have finished last night’s game, but extra inning wins on the road are really good for morale.
The effort has been there. Now all of a sudden the performance is matching it. We're no stranger to comebacks. We're in it for the long haul
For us to get back on top, tomorrow is a game we need to win. We have to start winning series consistently.
Day night doubleheader here in Baltimore. Let's play three!  Did that once for the Boulder Collegians in Sturgis, SD in 1980.

Spring training in June was great today. An energetic day. We ran the drills really well. It’s not punitive, it’s about re-focusing.
Thoughts tonight are with the Gwynn family. He was an artist not unlike Rod Carew.  And always smiling. Sad day for all of us in baseball.
@SarahMaddon when did u move ?
@JosephMaddon http://t.co/yWLzEiXLVe
@JosephMaddon so much better if she didn't mind getting her photo taken !  Happy Father's Day to best Dad I know ! Love u like a son ..
Happy we won the series, but we're still not playing the Rays brand of baseball.
@brettamorgan @RaysBaseball been at the exact spot !  Enjoy the moment ...!
I like this idea...when an instant replay call "stands" because it's inconclusive (rather than confirmed), the team keeps its challenge.
@TheBBRcom scouted and signed KK out of Grand Canyon a College...still is a 5 tool player...one of my all time faves !
When Cobb is right, I'd put him up against anyone in the game. He had the changeup going tonight - it's one of the 3 best in the AL.
@JimCampanis hey buddy...talking to Tommy about you and your Grandpop couple days ago...trust all is well...feather it is !
Kiermaier flying thru the air in right central was the play of the game, but how about Rollie Fingers showing up for the final 7 outs?

@RaysJoeMaddon  I think Bobby - our medicine man – dialed up a cleansing rain today.
I thought Felix had better stuff today than when he was perfect against us in 2012.
Our short term goal is to get to 50-50, then we’ll take our chances. We need to go 26-11. We’ve done that before standing on our heads.
Quick stop passing by my pal's office ! http://t.co/PePMauSUXT
I want to believe Kiermaier’s play is going to be very contagious. You’ve got to play with your hair on fire just like he’s doing right now.

Got a bunch of Coney Island Dogs for the clubhouse today. ZIm's favorite. http://t.co/8HKXuYBHhK
Hate to sound like a broken record, but if we keep pushing it will come back 2 us. We have too much talent 2 go thru this particular moment.
Zim was a treasure. He could impact everyone: the first-year player, veteran player, first-year manager, 9th-year manager, even the media.
When the team was struggling like this, I’d sic Zim on a couple guys &amp; he always had great advice. To the family, so sorry for your loss.
Not interested in receiving gifts of doubt and anger, but I would like to offer my gifts of optimism and trust.
It's a loss of confidence more than anything else right now with our guys. They need our support &amp; they will get it. It's not complicated.

Have to keep pushing that boulder in the other direction. Want to believe we will get a bump from this on the offensive side.
This is a highly teachable moment in the power of process.
I want the boys to enjoy the struggle so they can draw on the experience when it happens again because it will happen again. Stop &amp; learn.

Under the circumstances, one of the best 5-5 road trips in the history of the Rays.
If we just pitch our normal game today we had a chance to win. We're playing well. We just need more length out of our starters.
If you're a Rays fan u have to be proud. As a manager, these last 2 days tell you a lot about your players. I believe it's been galvanizing.
Proud of our boys . All the convoluted stuff yesterday, then spending all day in Fenway's diminutive clubhouse made it tough to win a split.
Can't remember the last time a pitcher talked me out of something but Balfour did today  on whether to pitch to Big Papi. It worked out.
@SarahMaddon @DuckDynastyAE hey buddy... Thought your bday was the 29th... Don't want to be late with our gift ! What do you want ?
The day could have been better but the nite couldn't have been. Thanx to Tim Mullen 4 hosting a great staff dinner. http://t.co/gQJPNsosk4

Tonight was an anomaly game vs that pitcher and vs that team, but we'll take it.

We won today because of what Kevin Kiermaier did. He pays attention to other parts of the game and is one of best defensive OFs in baseball.
Dave Parker visited our clubhouse today. I've never seen a more comfortable player on the field. Also one of funniest human beings I know.
Odorizzi pitched well today, his final line was misleading. Had some dribblers. Chalk up that homer to forces of nature.
It's been a lovefest with the umpires, a big happy discussion. Almost no reason to get upset anymore except balls and strikes.
Wearing the ball on top tonight and I'm comfortable with that. It's 50 degrees and I'm a wuss. http://t.co/POrV7iZFQ0

I’ll be the guest on Lunchtime Live with the #Rays on March 26. Sign up and submit questions at http://t.co/unAfzO6iUK. See you there.
Thanks to Ava for the haircut and the hug. http://t.co/7SinqhGIEd

Pretty good morning when you get to name David Price your Opening Day starter &amp; talk strategy with the Iron Man. http://t.co/EexTWnEuW5
Skyped with journalism students from Gibbs High this AM before our game. Great experience. Like to grow this concept. http://t.co/mqjtjK0ipF
Tremendous work Mr. Zimmer. RT @RaysBaseball Baseball legend Don Zimmer challenges #Rays fans to get in the game. http://t.co/bbz0Rn1KQv
Yunel is an energy source for us. We plug into him. We need to market an Esco-Bar, a new energy bar.
Very cool to be photographed this morning with an Officer and a Gentleman. http://t.co/z3hIPyJXIp
Making lunch for the boys today, hoagies from "the Base" with the peppers from Hazleton. That's Tyler on the onions. http://t.co/oSzYcGfR2P
A good spring training record means you have a good JV squad. And we do.
We called “Omaha” early today &amp; as a result it was mission accomplished. Most important: pitchers got their work in despite the rain.
Aroma matters. Just bought a bread maker for the lunch room. http://t.co/UtdfsQCM8Z
Many think the triple is the most exciting play in baseball. It is actually J-Molina scoring from 1st on a ball in the gap. We saw it today.
Pretty nice to have Matt Moore hit 93 his first time out. Also nice having 30 pitchers in camp and all are major league caliber.
Made 3rd base hoagies- southern style- for the coaches today. If they survive them, then I'll make 'em for the boys. http://t.co/euv0FzQJIz
No errors again today and everyone is pitching well. I like the way we’re going.
Met Lovie Smith and Jason Licht last night. Good people. Jason’s wife, Blair, and her father are Lafayette grads. Her dad is a frat brother.
Good to see Seth McClung out there for the Pirates today. He had a nice outing. I'm happy for him.

Photo day today. It’s always challenging to make me look good at any time of the day, especially tough at 8 a.m. http://t.co/LNnof2Yduj
Really impressed with the focus of our pitchers so far. We will start Cesar Ramos, David Price &amp; Alex Cobb in our first three spring games.
Met with MLB 2day regarding use of replay. 1 idea: why not play Dan Hartman's '78 classic Instant Replay for fans during the review process.
Great crowd today at FanFest.  Thank you. And thanks to those who came to our Thanksmas fundraiser. We raised nearly $10K for the homeless.
Thanks to Nancy Crane from the Pediatric Cancer Foundation for talking to the boys here today. We're shaving our heads for PCF on March 16.

A beautiful morning at camp got even better when I met Julie &amp; her dad Alan from Sarasota. Thanks! http://t.co/TtOv2zd5iE
My main purpose now is 2 create the message &amp; make sure the players understand it. It's a casual pace. They don't need me lording over them.
Today’s message, aimed primarily at the pitchers, was controlling the running game &amp; things of that nature. http://t.co/LP70JP4nPY

My thoughts are with Wally Bell’s family. Wally had a terrific sense of humor and was a great communicator. Our game lost a really good man.
Very proud of our guys and our fans. I think we played to our potential. We took it about as far as we could go. Boston just beat us.

We just went through a week of backs to the wall. Boston is lovely this time of year -- looking forward to coming back in a couple days.
Bought one new shirt on this extended trip. Didn't really need it, but it's always about matchups.
24 hours can make a huge difference.  That's just 1 game, baby, just 1 We'll be back tomorrow, We will not be affected mentally by tonight.
Thanks to Paul Kennedy from FOX @PaulKennedyFOX for today's inspirational message. It's on our board here. http://t.co/AcvmuQXPgt
This is a best of five-game series, but I'd love for us to play it like each is a one-game series, like we just came through.
Proud of our guys. So much focus &amp; energy. As a mgr to see your players act that way under these circumstances is something u never forget.

It's been that way for us all season. Nothing has come easy. Wonderful to be playing tomorrow based on the way the last 2 days went.
Tough being here in Canada without The Office on Netflix. Michael Scott has helped get me through the last couple of weeks.
We've faced great competition down the stretch to get to this point &amp; dealt with a lot of emotion last nite in NY. Really proud of our guys.
@Sarahboroski23 your pop is the greatest...get him his own twitter account...will do all I can to help...best to your family
For me tonight was not unlike the Ripken moment. Hard to imagine anyone surpassing Mariano. It's like DiMaggio's streak: untouchable.
Thanks to @KevinThomasKenn for today's inspirational message. http://t.co/a0IishFZhK
When the guy in the middle does what Longo did everybody feeds off it. But the 3-run homer doesn't happen without Wil's running hard to 1st.
Sat in the back pew at St. Patrick's Cathedral today looking for some help making out the lineup.
Thanks to @ChrisOverholt76 for today's message. http://t.co/7OHe53IDAh
Want to express our concern for Manny Machado, and hope for speedy and full recovery.  One of best young talents in our game !
Zobrist playing left field today won the game. His defense won the game period. Two great throws. You don't get better than that.
Starbucks man Howard Schultz makes it on the lineup card thanks to #FriendORays winner @Average_Chad http://t.co/ECW9jWZ1nK
How about Enny? Shows up after tweeting that he could help us, hasn't pitched in a few weeks, then goes 1 out short of a win. Tremendous.
The focus is on starting lineups but the Celtics did pretty well with Havlicek off the bench. 6th man concept applies 2 baseball this month.

Escobar made a rare error last night. Today he came in and wanted to do early work. That shows where our heads are right now.
Today's Friend O Rays winner is @nfn14655. Thanks Ed! http://t.co/imIhe0QIWO
Friend O Rays winner @GerdesJohn quoted John Wooden "Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out."
Darvish is wonderful but he was off his game tonight and we couldn’t capitalize. I was impressed with the way the Rangers bounced back.
Tonight is a perfect example of how every player matters.

The lineup features a quotes from General Powell. Thanks @jharper927 http://t.co/hrUgTTUHXU
Look at some of the plays last night. It's about inches every game.  We're losing the battle of inches right now.
Our Friend O Rays winner @brooksw44 brought us a quote from Coach K last night about teamwork http://t.co/qdBZFhdUUp
For this to end it just has to happen. Has to be organic, not contrived. Our confidence is nicked. We need 2 be supportive until it returns.
.@jacknicklaus was on the lineup card last night thanks to our Friend O Rays winner @MissGRod http://t.co/CArmfhYxZp
I just want to focus on tonight's game. Price vs. Buchholz. Once you start looking at the larger, clumpy things, it can get away from you.
Making mistakes will not hurt us,  trying not to make mistakes will.
The best 3-7 road trip in franchise history is over...and don't forget we played .500 ball the last 6 games.
Today's inspirational message is courtesy of @newspaper_man. http://t.co/8H0evNDlJK
Good luck to Coach Schiano and the boys today and for the 2013 season. Go Bucs.

Welcome to American Legion Week. No BP this series. I want to get the guys off their feet. Show up &amp; go just like we did in Legion ball.
We're not used to seeing this with Helly. We just have to remind him of all the things he does well.
@dcrippen1 hey buddy..great to see your tweet...always a pleasure when u visit our dugout...I must follow dcrippen1 !
Great crowds all weekend helped us. Thank you.
Double plays hurt us offensively speaking. We out-defensed them the other night. They may have done it to us today.
Thanks to @MKwiatkowski28 for today's quote on the lineup http://t.co/sMAIY9x9yv
Our defense wasn't good tonight,  it was great. I said to Davey Martinez in the 5th inning we have to win this game based on our defense.
Matt Moore looked sharp in his simulated game today. At first I didn't think we had enough shaggers. But we did. We had two.
Hero and HOFer Roberto Clemente gets on the lineup sheet for tonight's game. Thanks @FLPrntSolutions http://t.co/02q7NK4Et5
Sending this over to Mariano from the coaching staff: To eres el mejor! http://t.co/sufy8dGST6
I had come upstairs to the clubhouse restroom when Davis hit his home run. But I did hear it.
Premier, elite curveball for Alex Cobb tonight. I don't know who in the game throws a better curveball than him.
@Javierwould would really enjoy photo of all in attendance....maybe next time ?
We played prevent defense entire night. Kept the safeties deep, funneled receivers thru middle and kept them out of the end zone. Woof.
I thought Brandon Gomes' stuff looked real good. His stuff got sharper during his extended rehab stint.
I told our clubhouse manager Chris Westmoreland to have a vat of ice cream on the plane for Lobaton. He earned it.
Congratulations to JA Happ on how well he pitched tonight based on what happened to him the last time he pitched here.
Good spot tonight to get Wil off his feet again. Want him rested. Hasn't  played a lot of September baseball. Plus, he doesn't mind DHing.
The legendary Herb Brooks on the lineup sheet via our Friend O Rays winner @coachsenato29 http://t.co/ldhwIYFDVU
First Lobaton got an RBO in the top of the 9th &amp; then when was the last time a catcher hit a walk-off triple? I don’t know. Incredible.
Needed a place to park the new RV 4 the night so brought it to the Trop. I want to call it the Cousin Eddie. http://t.co/y5dTtpdlvJ
Legendary pitcher Satchel Paige on the lineup today. Thanks @JasonAquilar http://t.co/Ioa6iksB1H
More Asia. She was calm, affable like Cliff &amp; Shelly, our penguins. I could c them all cavorting in our clubhouse providing Asia has eaten.

A snake is a risk taker and a wellspring of ideas. They fit into the Rays Way. Asia was a big hit today. http://t.co/wrZTY9nR0p

Today's Friend O Rays winner is @Blachuraa Thank you! http://t.co/x84C4yAdqf
Dodgers pitching very impressive last two nights - much like ours will be when we're going right again.
Batting Helly 8th was about giving us the PH option earlier, and also protecting Myers. I called Tony LaRussa this week to pick his brain.
We will throw this one in the wastebasket as soon as possible and come back ready to play tomorrow.
Thanks to @landon_ryan for today's quote from the great MJ. http://t.co/hE3KvftGnP
Got to meet my grandson Giuseppe last night. He wasn't nearly as impressed meeting me as I was with him.
Thought I was looking in a mirror the last 3 days. Rays, Giants very similar. Great defense and pitching. Meatloaf didn't come easy.
The fans have been great. It does make a difference for us and I think we’ve entertained them. Love to see them out there. Keep on coming.
Our Friend-O-Rays winner today is @Matthewmgross http://t.co/cpGzAs1DTn
How about the crowd tonight? Thanks for helping us overcome a good ball club and...go 2-0 on Maddon Gnome Nights.
Congrats to Warren Sapp, a friend-o-Rays. Believe he would have made a good catcher. He'll be here Aug 24 to throw out the first pitch.
Former Bucs coach Tony Dungy from @amytara1 http://t.co/A8udciWVM6
The Gnome is back tonight for the first 10,000 fans. Mind boggling, humbling that we would do this twice. http://t.co/KFGB1FCHjI
.@BillCosby on the lineup sheet. Thanks @onecagedtiger http://t.co/INyqkFxm3j
I was asked if I thought tonight was the result of a hangover from the road trip. I said no, that was a Miley hangover. He was really good.
Very Zen. Thanks @jrhind1 http://t.co/6yZbeZXBPn
Stay in the present boys.
Gandhi on the lineup sheet today. Thanks @cubswincubswin http://t.co/0wcnlZd8rA
Great team road trip. Everyone contributed. Mr. Pesky almost tripped us up tonight, but David was again dominant.
The media asked me today about Wil Myers' hair. I said it looks like he combs it with the leg of a chair. I'm good with it.
Thanx to @cindysrq for today's quote: "The price of excellence is discipline. The cost of mediocrity is disappointment.” William Arthur Ward
Was hoping to get to Fenway and see us at the top of the board but you can't win every game. Yankees played well. Derek gave them a spark.
Thanks to @DanielRockhold for today's motivational message. http://t.co/RaIID95mUs
Today was like a classic mid 60s duel at Yankee Stadium. It was incredible to watch. Arch was just a little bit better.
Had a great pregame visit with veterans from Walter Reed Hospital thanks to Patient Air Lift Services (PALS) http://t.co/mPkAtfXxRz
Wear your friend-o-rays t-shirt proudly and thanks for Colin Powell quote @Danny28591375. It's on the board. http://t.co/I0tmv0wlBf
@JosephMaddon congrats to Natalie, Joey, Coral, and of course Giuseppe....7.5 lbs...20in...c u in a couple weeks !
@PaulAzinger thx Paul...Giuseppe is his name...c u at the Trop..
It's not cool to have a 10-1 lead and have to sweat it out, but we will take it. Up and down the lineup everyone contributed.
Thanks to @mwoolery5 for today's message from Mark Twain posted in our clubhouse at Yankee Stadium tonight. http://t.co/kDPJvfUJrL
The visiting manager's office must be the coldest room in Fenway, but get 2 wear my Lafayette Leopards gear. http://t.co/7b4EubNDUS
Thanks to @jbbucfan for today's inspirational quote. http://t.co/oLbk0mD94U
David is a sharper version of 2012. Hard to imagine anyone pitching better in terms of stuff, velocity, location vs. a quality opponent.
Here's the quote on our bulletin board tonight. Thanks to @LBHSsoftball. http://t.co/gXFJwLCXbP
Enjoyed speaking with the boys from @PTI today from Fenway. Thanks Bob and Michael. http://t.co/Lqki0u75KL
We have to do a better job vs. their pitchers. Lester was good. He was a strike thrower tonight.
Thanks to @RussellBtpa for today's quote. http://t.co/jTPXNp7tiJ
Matt was all about the #1 tonight. One breath, one delivery, one pitch, one strike. This was his absolute best tonight. Total control.
On our bulletin board tonight. Thanks to @JahIckory. Your friend-o-rays shirt is on the way. http://t.co/TolGgtd7C3
@JosephMaddon @pictureline hey buddy, just reviewed your work...impressive ! The written content is equally great...very proud !
Thanks to @chadrucks1976 for yesterday's quote from Roger Staubach. http://t.co/hRRCOGvF6K
Too many times outfield defense is under appreciated. Not today. Sam and Desmond cutting balls off and getting them back in were huge.
Thanks to @dlcama for today's quote from  Ralph Waldo Emerson. It's on our bulletin board this morning. http://t.co/0ia3bWoX6a
We put it down for a couple of days and picked it right back up tonight. That was a real good team win. The vibe in the dugout was fabulous.
Thanks to @BrianKnapp1414 for that. http://t.co/gwYPIS8REQ
Today's quote  “Hated every minute of training, but said, ‘Don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of life as a champion.’” Muhammad Ali
Sharing the field today with the Home Show. Didn't want to be idle. Worked on bunt def and hit in the cages. http://t.co/BhNsu54Ba2
Our starting pitching will present a nice problem when Cobb returns. No worrying now. Jaye and I are RVing to parts unknown for 3 days.
Today's quote is spot on. Thanks @denverd36 http://t.co/1NW7cI7NEi
We were doing the Kon-Tiki routine early today, just drifting, dead in the water, before Luke’s homer in the 5th. He was our Thor Heyerdahl.
@sthomas141 Follow me so we can send you a shirt
@Kelso1964 Follow me so I can send you your shirt
Inspiration from Jack Dempsey. Thanks @sthomas141 http://t.co/T907gQos2q
Check out the scoreboard image for tonight. It's Disco Night. That's pretty close to my look back in the day http://t.co/DeTb1b7gGp
David would have gone out to pitch the tenth inning. Amazing he threw only 17 balls in a CG. Give their kid credit. He was outstanding.
Matt had no-hit stuff today. Truly an All-Star performance. This was his best start of the season for me.
Bear Bryant quote for the early game @candiceosika http://t.co/5obpeqRy4b
A win like tonight doesn't guarantee a win tomorrow but it makes it easier to walk in the door. Luke's walk in the 13th was the big moment.
@mariomendoza11 my Palm Springs fave !
Some inspiration from one of the greatest champions of all time. Thanks @Kelso1964 http://t.co/lUUU0Fo3gN
We are starting to play up to our capabilities. We're locking down wins with pitching &amp; defense--games we were losing earlier in the year.
Today's Friend-O-Rays winner is @twicethecitizen http://t.co/w5UOETfF9e
Playing our best ball right now. The major takeaway tonight is that we're 10 games over .500. Our next step segmentally is 2 get to 15 over.
Another Vince Lombardi quote on the lineup sheet thanks to @Albano_Brian http://t.co/ZUiYxTopPH

Today's Friend-O-Rays winner is @mwoolery5 http://t.co/8Plub53vqG
More evidence of the swarm: we now have 8 guys with 30 RBI.
Tonight’s in-game entertainment and 70s music was the best ever. Hats off to the people upstairs. I was totally entertained.
I love Ben's all-star selection from the perspective that a complete game matters, it’s not just about batting average. He personifies that.
Love the throwbacks. http://t.co/fd6hPMmsQt
A great quote from the great Bambino. Thanks @joshsuszek15 http://t.co/JT5OSGkl9i
I like us to swarm whenever possible. We only chased 5-6 pitches out of the strike zone tonight. When you don't chase, you can swarm.

Tim Duncan on the lineup sheet from @Boltsfan2029 One of the best for a very long time http://t.co/1BrMLksErK
@mariomendoza11 would love some...best to your family !
3 out of 4 in Houston. Since we can't enjoy meatloaf, we will have brisket &amp; ribs, beans and chips &amp; salsa.
Happy Fourth! Thanks to @mkimbs for this MLK quote yesterday. http://t.co/Mj1fqhM19t
@arabsareawesome pleasure to meet you...prayers and wishes all continues to progress...beautiful little girl..see you next time in Houston
Chris Carter is an impressively strong man.
Got to visit w/Carlos today. He's been so generous in helping us out in Hazleton. My heart goes out to his family after their tragedy.
Yesterday's winner @emarlowe14 from T. LaSorda: "The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination."
David was spectacular. Haven't seen that consistent command, velocity &amp; focus from him since 2012. A complete performance.
Our Friend-O-Rays winner yesterday was @mwgfdn with a quote from Winston Churchill http://t.co/QQ06xGy1sV
Quality at-bats up and down lineup tonight. Sean, Yunel, Ryan, Sam. When you don't chase, you score runs.
Enjoyed creativity of our Hispanic players who stepped up for Accidental Preppie road trip. Not a lot of preppyism where they come from.
Another veteran with a great look-- Jamey Wright. http://t.co/HwWkK67DAw
J-mo has a tremendous look. http://t.co/hX6sZ1Gwkt
Let the Accidental Preppie Trip to Houston begin! http://t.co/iDYvFacpiv
For those looking for a response as to why we didn’t retaliate today, please read Mario Puzo.
Ralph Waldo Emerson shows up on the lineup card thanks to @ForTheJoke http://t.co/pPSSD7nu6Q
Congratulations to yesterday's Friend-O-Rays winner @MisterGmiddle http://t.co/6OitZLoTTx
This is the game we have been talking about that we have to start winning and tonight we did it against a very good team.
Back in the day it was Big Papi and Manny, now it's Fielder and Cabrera.  We didn't play badly tonight, they just out-homered us.
Friend-O-Rays winner @Baycrab3 gave us an impassioned quote from Vince Lombardi http://t.co/Dj4NRRWb5c
Price will start Tuesday in Houston. That way he will start the last Friday before the break and the first Friday after.
And @nickuhh was yesterday's winner http://t.co/jt3yAFpxoX
Tuesday's Friend-O-Rays winner @danifb55 with a Frank Robinson quote http://t.co/vDCO0zTnGf
We were totally ready to play today we just got out-pitched. Jays scored 5 runs in the 3 games. That’s the kind of series we have to play.
Matty was missing early but I appreciate how he did not cave in. He got sharper as the game progressed.
Our next themed trip is accidental preppie to Houston. Looking for shorts &amp; sports coats from the guys. Seersucker and madras encouraged.
Today's Friend-O-Rays winner @dauntlesstitan with a great motivational quote http://t.co/phEC0j6Og5
Yesterday's winner @Hightower8585 quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson. Nicely done. http://t.co/9RcbmUuoxw
There was some consideration 2 hit for Loney in the 7th vs Logan. I didn't b/c he's never in trouble w/ 2 strikes &amp; doesn't try 2 do 2 much.
Yesterday's winner of a friend-o-rays t-shirt @JosephOtte quoted Maya  Angelou. Congrats! http://t.co/dIHe5HNCBM
We saw Wil-power today, but 9 walks by our pitchers was too much to overcome.
Congrats to @reCash for submitting yesterday's winning quote from the Wizard of Westwood. http://t.co/m1Ho21RTsW
Don't be deceived by his numbers. Roberto pitched well. Any time he gets ground balls that's a good thing. It just didn't work out tonight.
Congratulations to @revwarren for yesterday's inspiration. Wear the friend-o-rays t-shirt with pride. http://t.co/QEi5xYNDeP
@intheclearing just parts of every day ! Best to your pop, and see you next week...good luck to you in the tryout..
I was almost sucked out of the dugout by the vortex J-Mo created when he rounded 3rd on Zo's single.  It's like getting caught in jet wash.

I don't want to lump a bunch of high expectations on Wil. We'll put him in the bottom part of the order and let him play, just be a Ray.
Thanks to @coachadkisson for the quote on the lineup sheet today http://t.co/xBfLnImNo2
Ron Porterfield &amp; our medical staff did a great job today. All went beyond professionalism with how well they dealt with an awful moment.
Today's Friend-O-Rays winner @Morris2point0 quotes Aristotle. Awesome http://t.co/UnfgLGGkSs
I know I sound like a broken record but we have to pitch a lot better to get to the spot we want to this year.

Congrats Jaye, Carmine, &amp; Francine...Shop 2 Consignment Furniture opens today...105 E. Broad St, Hazleton...tell them Joey sent ya !
We’re hearing too many glowing things about our middle relievers. Our starters pitching deep into games with a lead, that’s our DNA.
David threw a simulated game today and looked like he could have pitched in a regular game. Everything looked outstanding.
John Wooden makes the lineup sheet today and @AndrewRBecker gets a Friend-O-Rays shirt! http://t.co/mfuQpHO87y

Our Friend-O-Rays winner last night @mseninsk25 with a quote from the great Lou Holtz http://t.co/3VBZPN4lgZ
The Sox have had their way with us so if we could Meatloaf them tomorrow that would be kind of nice before they leave town.
Really felt all along we were going to win tonight. If we play with that kind of effort on a nightly basis were going to get our 90 wins.
Congratulations to our first Friend-O-Rays winner @A_Broham Good stuff http://t.co/aTlctrhm62
Thanks to Davis Island fans...rode by on the bike, had to tweet photo... http://t.co/EpXvOeyHIL

Martina McBride got the first Friend-O-Rays T-shirt. Beginning today I will give one away every day. http://t.co/RPxGx2UmuN
Great to see Longo beginning his "Reading with the Rays"program...very proud of his efforts here...exercise for the mind !
@SarahMaddon @DuckDynastyAE @Bass_Pro_Shops may b my favorite Tre photo !
Like Desmond where he's at in the lineup and also like Matt in the leadoff spot and Kelly at no. 3. We'll let that ride awhile.
National champion University of Tampa Spartans in the house tonight! http://t.co/Wu4vpTWOJw
@JeffSchaefer2 hey buddy...great to hear from you and respect your endorsement...best to your family

Jammin' to Frank Yankovic with "Just Because".. Tribute to the men and women from YMPA in Hazleton...especially Taylor Mateo RIP
Congrats to @UT_Baseball and my friend Joe Urso for their 3rd NCAA Division II championship in the last 8 years. See u at the Trop on Friday
Loby's blocking has been outstanding and throwing has been better. Playing and interacting with a calm confidence. He knows he belongs
I respect the guys' effort but of course we are all tired. We got outpitched and out-Giambied. I'm ready to go to bed.
As cool of a win as I've been involved with at this level, with the team being so engaged at midnight after 3:30 arrival the night before.
Jose Fernandez might be the best young pitcher I've ever seen, at that age. I believe he will go far.
Fernando's looking much better - fastball location, arm angle and swagger. Arrows have been gradually more demonstrative.
Alex Colome:  expectations exceeded.
Honored 2 b included in the National Alliance For Youth Sports coaching video 4 coaches @ US military bases worldwide http://t.co/SSh3LTGezA
Told Alex just to go out and pitch tonight. Don't look at video, don't look at the radar. Just do the same things you were doing at Durham.
Yunel was by far the best dressed on the all white trip last night. Very tight fitting. We're all jealous we can't do the same thing.
Our annual all white trip to Miami starts now. http://t.co/B4jGjChaaR
Loney's throws are like Stabler's to Casper over the middle. Especially the one today to Escobar. He's a dart thrower.
Wishing everyone a great Memorial Day spent with loved ones. Today's look to benefit Welcome Back Veterans. http://t.co/CVWXjjTGrL
The beautiful part of our team is that we are so unpredictable. We didn’t give the Yankees the advantage 2day based on last night’s results.
As long as Fernando doesn’t lose confidence in himself, I'm not going to lose confidence in him.
Congrats to Charlie Montoyo for his 500th win at Durham tonight.
Great to have Kevin Garcia the 2013 Freddie Solomon Moral Courage Award winner with us tonight. http://t.co/AiNdUOVg1t
Enjoyed being in the company of the Lightning's Jon Cooper and the Bucs' Greg Schiano at tonight's Sneaker Soirée. http://t.co/zfj0J0netB
Another difficult loss but you have to stick with your guys. It will come back to us.  I will not lose my optimism.
Great team win tonight. Go Rays.
Historically speaking it's been wonderful, but Matt knows there is more in Moore. Love his accountability.
Rays never quit. Alex Torres demonstrates the importance of playing winter ball.
Thanks to the fellas from back home for their support of HIP: Pepsi, Rick, Greg and Skip at Camden Yards today. http://t.co/b71JjFlDdz
How about the boys last night? Coming back to play as well as we did after a tough loss on Thurs was a tribute to everyone in the clubhouse.
It was an honor to meet Lt. Col. Bill Adams last night before he surprised his daughter by catching her first pitch. http://t.co/RjiPekYHVM
We're getting a lot of experience at bouncing back from games like that and will do it again tomorrow.
@gabekapler shall...best to the family...
Sad to see The Office go and while the cast is spectacular, it hasn't been the same with Michael Scott. Like Curb without Larry David.
Got a good vibe after talking to David. I don't anticipate an extended stay on the disabled list for him.
Rodney's magical plátanos are here to stay. They're on a roll. We're looking for some good recipes.
Great vibe in the clubhouse today with music by Sol Caribe. Let's see if it carries over into tonight's game. http://t.co/KMurgeaFJp
The hitting continues, the defense has been there and the pitching is starting to come around. When it does, heads up.
Happy Mother's Day!  Going with the pink look today in support of the  fight against breast cancer. http://t.co/rNIABewj3y
Zobrist's walk is going to b overlooked. But u can't.There are some guys that are so hung up on hits they can't see the forest for the walk.
I would rather be good than lucky. We want to be playing in October. To do that u have to be good. We were fortunate to have Longo up there.
Kenny Loggins: He's Alright. http://t.co/COJC09bSr5

Sent a bottle of 2009 Emilio Moro over to Bud Black with instructions not to open until a Padrays World Series.
@lsubooger was my pleasure...best to Rich too...u got the steaks, I got the vino...
Tonite could be a springboard for David. I loved his aggressiveness. He looked a lot more like himself. Best stuff he's had all year.
Thanks for the memories Ronde Barber.
Hoping doesn't work in baseball.  You have to believe. You have to go out every day believing it will turn and eventually it does.
My thoughts and prayers tonight are with JA Happ, his family and the Blue Jays organization.
Great meeting the folks from the Homeless Emergency Project in Clearwater. We'll make a Thanksmas stop there in Dec. http://t.co/YScgfDbuvS
Fernando was fine tonight. Just not used to throwing that many pitches. A difficult loss but its more about how we react tomorrow.
Congrats to David Stoner who stayed up late to watch us Fri nite  then graduated from SPC at the Trop on Saturday AM. http://t.co/WvUI5o3Wcv
Cobb did what he needed to do today. HRs are part of the game in this park. And his swing won the pitchers' battle this weekend, hands down.
Our big play yesterday was Lobaton's RBO - run blocked out.
This was the type of game we should expect to win: late, tight and on the road.
Today was eerily similar it 2008 World Series Game 5 in Philly, with dropping temps &amp; rain/snow, but daytime instead of night.
From one Pennsylvania boy to another, thanks to Governor Tom Corbett for the grant to assist our Hazleton Integration Project.
@SarahMaddon very cool honey !
Joe Gno will be planking again for today's game. It worked yesterday. I gave him the night off in upright position. http://t.co/EqHWqZtyKc
There's more in Moore. As his fastball continues to go where he wants, he could get hot for a long time.
Everything Yunel does is 100%. With him I encourage the chrome. I call him El Nino - I never want to coach the boy out of his game.
@SarahMaddon @tsdtsd the gnome is in the mail :)
The winning gnome is packed in my bag and heading to Chicago.
Just want our guys to chill. Thanks to the Florida Aquarium for loaning us Cliff (seated) and Shelly. http://t.co/N9yL3cwfLc
Check out the Rays new community report site http://t.co/T4Q0yfxY8O. Happy to be a small part of all the great community work we do here.

I might shed a tear tomorrow. To be the first manager replicated in the world of gnomedom is truly an honor. http://t.co/45YFuuRBLs
Fun to see the guys hit now. The offense is coming back because we didn't quit. We won't quit.
Worked on bunt defense drills today with NL games approaching. Also was honored to meet 5-month-old Maddon Warwick. http://t.co/nUHuUfF176
Thanks to Geoff Williams for your pregame magic. May it wear off on us. http://t.co/lXbxp1oTKi
Really nice to have the Bucs' Gerald McCoy here today with his son Marcellus. http://t.co/WAUmmMLQwS
Day Rave 1. Just another way of getting ready for a game. Thank you to DJ Fresh. http://t.co/w7Bj9Zp0x1
Tonight's anthem singer Mary Olive Gauthier was outrageously good. She is a 15-year old high school freshman.
We haven't yet scratched the surface as to how well we can play. We are better than that. Guys will come back to who they are.
Good to see the offense come alive. We definitely have more confidence at the plate.
from Mark Twain "the difference between hitting in the Big Leagues and AAA, is like the difference between lightning and the lightning bug."
@JosephMaddon nice going buddy !
Don't think yesterday's tragedy will affect our play but like everyone else it will b on our minds almost constantly when we leave the park.
Just landed safely in Baltimore.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims &amp; the families affected by this afternoon's horrible event.
I'm happy the recognition for Jackie is growing. Still don't think the courage of this man is fully understood. http://t.co/vvTWWKX8i8
When your guys aren't hitting u have to stay with them because it will come around. We've been here be4. This isn't the road less traveled.
We're just missing right now. We have to keep pounding on the door until it opens. The tale of today was 0-11 with runners in scoring pos.
It was great meeting Sean &amp; George Casey here at  Fenway. Thanx guys for supporting the Hazleton Integration Project. http://t.co/62ngrXijWk
I was not totally offended by the weather here today but really glad for the letterman jackets. http://t.co/hCdL1iDePe
I've always said the Rays like stormy weather. Well, we've got it. http://t.co/E5T8iHladP
Too early to be concerned about the offense.  Biggest thing is to build confidence. Frustrating tonite.They're winning the battle of inches.
Our first themed dress trip of the season: letterman jackets from Texas to Boston tomorrow. http://t.co/pC0qiWrwLp
That can't happen in a major league game.
We had a minor accident on the bus to the park today. It was like two base runners trying to pass each other on the base path.
Strange day today. Two Cy Youngs struggled.  David didn't have his put-away pitch. Still, we meatloafed them.
When Matt's fastball is a strike, all of his other pitches come alive. That was the case tonight.
To all of our Hazleton followers:  HHS '72 rules! http://t.co/1YJWlNtSPN
My takeaway from this series: the intensity from both clubs. We like facing good teams. When the new guys come 2gether you'll c us take off.
Tonight was probably as complete a win as you can possibly have. Everybody contributed. A good baptism for the new guys.
We played well. The Longo/Sam show was outstanding. It was somewhat formulaic for us until Jones messed it up. Give their hitters credit.
Slept well last nite. Regardless of 2day's result the coaches &amp; staff have done a great job of preparation. We're ready mentally, physically
Opening day almost a national holiday   Here's how we'll go: Jennings8, Fuld9, Zobrst4, Longo5, Joyce7, Escobar6, Loney3, Molina2, Johnsondh
@SarahMaddon miss you all....happy Easter !
Hope all of you are celebrating Easter or Passover holidays with family.  I'm grateful to be able to do so.
.@CoachEnfield congrats coach. Want to invite you and your players to throw out a ceremonial first pitch. Dunk City visits the Trop.
I love spring training and don't mind getting up early but today was the last day for a while that the alarm is going to wake me up at 6 am.
We'll start the season with a rotation of Price, Helly, Hernandez, Moore &amp; Cobb. Tough decision to move Niemann to pen. Great competition.
Check out Jaye's blog from her recent road trip....still time to donate to http://t.co/flcx7WY6gs http://t.co/iLEmRxfi9B
Breaking camp 2nite. It's been a long, one but undoubtedly the most pleasurable aspect of the spring was the people. Thanx Charlotte County!
Doug Amaral, the proprietor of River City Grill is our guest manager in the dugout 2day. He is Rays family. Takes great care of us here.
The last couple of days haven't been easy. Had to send some major league players back to triple A.
Loved our ABs up/down the lineup 2nite. Also loved @TheCutch22 beating out a ground ball in 9th in a spring game. Great moment for MLB.
Helly threw the ball well today. Love that he went 7 to get in mindset of going deep for the season Couple nice plays in the field too.
Congrats to the Bulls for their win over Texas Tech and good luck to our southerly neighbors FGCU and @CoachEnfield tonight.
I was surprised to hear the news about Guy Boucher. He's not just a good guy--he's a great guy.
Our nutritionist Cynthia Sass is here 2day. She does a great job but no one can eat as many choc donuts as George Hendrick &amp; look that good.
Saw the new Jackie Robinson movie last nite. Casting is terrific so was ballpark imagery. Harrison Ford &amp; Chadwick Boseman very believable.
Haven't kept up with the teams in the NCAA tournament like I should have, but I am keeping an eye on USF in the women's bracket.
@JimCampanis great to hear from you...please give my best to your family...Feel very fortunate having known your grandpop!
Luke Scott is capable of so much. He's got a knack for driving in runs. His swing is easier now with better results.

Thanks everyone who helped today especially folks from Tampa Pediatric Foundation and Majestic for the Fortune Favors the Bald t-shirts.
Today was all about the kids. And fortune really did favor the bald when Stephen Vogt hit a walkoff HR in the tenth. http://t.co/5ZesEE1Za9
Shaving head made my memory fuzzy.
Actually it was 2012 not 2011 when we first  shaved our heads to raise funds and awareness for the Pediatric Cancer Foundation. My mistake.
Remember this from 2011?We're doing it again pregame on Friday. Join us in supporting the Pediatric Cancer Foundation http://t.co/GBpAwKbVlR
@NoelleRuby21 how are u? Please give my best to Ruby clan !
Made it official today. David will start the opener. His tomfoolery and the fact that he's such a good cheerleader in the dugout sealed it.
Best wishes 2 my fellow bikers pedaling 300 miles from Tampa to Tallahassee to support Moffitt Cancer Center awareness. Wish I could join u.
Pitching coach Jim Hickey's demonstrative point to the bullpen in the fourth inning was the highlight of today.

Met Jonathan at River City Grill last month and was delighted to have him as our guest at today's game with Philly. http://t.co/yWC29e0YQf
The line score of this game looks like a pitcher's duel but it really wasn't. We hit the ball well. I'm liking our approach at the plate.
Colonoscopy completed. All good. Painless and now realize nothing to fear. Should have done it sooner. Urge everyone 50+ to get 'er done.
We’re shaving our heads again to support Pediatric Cancer Foundation. 3/15 vs. PHI. Donate $100 at http://t.co/3secfpihCa &amp; you can join us.
@GabiMaletz     That's the one.
Went thru clubhouse 2day playing Bang A Gong on my Ipad. Offered $100 to anyone who knew the artist. No one did. Love it as our walkon song.
Maybe our coldest game ever in FLA, but we played another good all-around game. Best thing about Wil Myers triple?  Liked the way he ran.
2day was our most complete game of the spring. Started with Cobb. That's also the kind of game we can expect from Yunel with bat and glove.
On the ESPN Bus this morning with Tim Kurkjian and Chris Gimenez. I could drive this. http://t.co/QxNvtajmjn
@933FLZ  Thanks!
Going to miss @Pink at the Times Forum 2nite but would love to have her throw out 1st pitch at tomorrow's game vs Tigers or take BP.
Honored to have members of the Wounded Warriors work out with us this morning. They will be with us all week. http://t.co/rKH9a6WgHn
Leslie Anderson is a different player since I saw him. He unequivocally looks good. Other than the 9th inning today was a pretty clean game.
The music for BP here at Hammond Stadium in Ft. Myers is outstanding.
Former Angel Orlando Palmeiro here today for our spring opener as part of our Adopt-A-Legend program. http://t.co/cYxNO9Vebv
Things. Especially important to our new players.
With games starting tomorrow. The primary thing to this point has been to get the message out there about how we do
My freshman football coach at Lafayette Steve Schnall was here 2day. Was our energy coach. Had him speak to the boys. http://t.co/kOjr5WyTor
For the split squad games on Sat. I will stay back and Dave Martinez will manage in Ft Myers solely because they have a Bass Pro Shop there.
One of my favorite places at our Port Charlotte complex. Our half field with the Gold Glove wall in the background. http://t.co/4bpbOaom
Enjoying the Rays Charity Golf tournament with the good folks from The Tampa Bay Times. http://t.co/M1VtsR92
Cold today. Held the first full team meeting inside.  The media asked if Wil Myers reminded me of anyone.  I went with a beefier Jim Carrey.
It was great seeing thousands of faces at FanFest today including our own Shannon Magrane. Thanks to everyone for your support.
Thanks to Peter Gammons who spoke at our Thanksmas fundraising lunch today at FanFest...and thanks to all who came. http://t.co/OdmfvvnO
Hope to c everyone at FanFest tomorrow. Come by and say hi. We'll be serving up Thanksmas lunch. Proceeds go to charity. Tix are available.
Really like what I'm seeing right now from Fausto Hernandez. Plus, he's a good guy, a big teddy bear.
Fun to watch our pitchers. Exciting 2 see that many good arms in 1 spot. 2day was Odorizzi, Cobb, Helly, Arch, Moore. http://t.co/U000ODBF
Day One went well. Every pitcher who threw today did something well.  Great seeing our fans again. http://t.co/g8dngg4R
Met with media today - spring training eve. Told them I believe our defense is as good as it has ever been. http://t.co/N1LH2Y8X
@RustlersRooste and thanks to your staff for providing great food and service for our post Sarah and Theo wedding celebration !

It's official. We bought our community center in Hazleton today. Thanks to so many. Lot of positive energy. Goal is to open doors in March.
Thanks BJ for everything you brought to our club. We couldn't have become the Rays without you.
@JohnM1977 try following link..thanks for support...http://t.co/0ga0dQEU
On my way to Hazleton for HIP...purchasing MPB parochial school for our community center....highly exciting !

Well done David..peer recognition possibly most gratifying of all....now on to Cy race....we got you number 1...congrats to your family too.
Congrats 2 Coach Zim. Looking 4ward to giving up #70 in 5 yrs. Zim makes all of us better. And may God bless Soot, the true superstar.
Love it when our guys are recognized for their defense. Congrats to Helly on the Gold Glove.
better late than never...from me and all the Rays congrats to Fernando on recent awards..maybe others to come ?  you were historic !
Cheers to Buck and the O's and Bo Mel and the A's on great, great seasons.
Heading to California this weekend. Will be back for Thanksmas in December.  Thanks to everyone who supported us this year.
I like the idea that we played with such intensity in game 162.
Welcome back Jorden. http://t.co/VEBgUBtH
Postseason:  we were good enough to go, but we didn't play well enough. We all could have done better. That's true for all of us.
Shieldsy losing that game  is the crime of the year.
We're going to go hard to win these 2 games just the way Buck and the Orioles did it last year. I know he wouldn't want it any other way.
So proud of our guys tho i am a little upset. We're good enough 2 b there and playing at the top of our game but I'm going home to barbecue.
Congrats to David for 20 wins. We still believe.
I thought we had one mulligan left and we just used it. Now  we definitely have to do our best Minnesota Fats imitation.
We've been going with optional BP for the past week and we'll continue it the rest of the way. Our goal is simply to go 1-0 on Thursday.
Our rookie hazing took a different twist tonight at Fenway.  It was tremendous. A James Shields production. http://t.co/jXh0WkCp
We have to keep going 1-0 each day. A 1-game win streak every day. Another bonus tonight: I had the honor of meeting John Havlicek.
Same goes for Elliot Johnson. http://t.co/Acufjyen
Sean Rodriguez didn't make the team photo but needed to be seen. http://t.co/xVqBHUdl
Welcome to our Wigs Gone Wild Trip to Boston. http://t.co/RWoCbLyb
JP's play on Rasmus was the play of the year.  Impossible to make but he did it. The afterbirth of that play in our dugout was incredible.
I totally believe we can do this
Guy Boucher from the Lightning is here  2 throw out the 1st pitch. Trying to talk him into a slap shot instead of pitch http://t.co/pvVdizvR
We've been missing a little bit of the magic this year, but it couldn't get any more magical than 2nite. There has never been any quit here.
It's all about not hitting. It's not a lack of intensity. The moment we start hitting you'll see our guys look like the flying Wallendas.
Big thanks to the those who were waiting for us at the airport last night.  Love your support. It doesn't go unnoticed.
If we learned anything from last year it was not to give up on our guys.
We had two Cy Young candidates pitch for us tonight. Two guys at the top of their game and it was fun to watch
Love playing these meaningful games this time of year. It's important to stay in the present tense and enjoy it.
@CardsMarkD @azcardinals  just about to write, and there you are...congrats to Coach W and the boys...finish was a bit to exciting !
Congrats to Coach Schiano on a great debut.  Let's both celebrate one over New York next Sunday.
The razor-thin line between winning and losing was on display tonight
We took the team picture today. This version was a tribute to our closer. http://t.co/9ExOCIJ1
Might b 1st time in the amplification era a player hit a walkoff the same nite his wife sang the anthem. Julianna Zobrist is welcome anytime
Great to have Leigh in the house tonight.  Can't tell from the photo but we are wearing tonight's give away neon caps. http://t.co/y6VYzDlM
@RaysJoeMaddon  We're playing great right now not just good. We made mistakes tonight we won't make the rest of the year.  Love our effort.
Apologies to the writers for being late to today's pregame session. My pedicure appointment ran a little late.
Thanks to John Hardin and Paul Cullen - former bassist for Bad Company- for some great wine from Paul's Uncorked and Unplugged Cali winery.
The BJ-Zorilla double steal in the 5th inning was a big play today. BJ loves this time of the year.  He is not afraid of the moment.
@EricBainbridge just finished 11/22/63 by S King... Fall of Giants by Follett..now reading The Fallen Angel by Daniel Silva..recommend all 3
Popcorn in the dugout courtesy of George Hendrick paid dividends tonight. On to Toronto. No trips to Negativetown for us.
The only positive from today was that we served as a test for the secret service in preparation for the RNC event here tomorrow.
RNC Chairman Reince Pribus throwing out the first pitch tonight here at the Trop.  Enjoyed talking to him. http://t.co/vG81gF94
Cobby was 59 pitches in 2.2 innings last time out and 113 in 9 tonight.  His command of the fastball permitted that to happen.
The beers, sausage and pickled eggs are on me for the regulars at the Safety Harbor American Legion Post 238 tonight. http://t.co/1l7lyNKH
Thanks to Safety Harbor American Legion Post 238 for the banner as we continue to salute Legion ball this week. No BP. http://t.co/9TYclRMw
It's American Legion ball this week. No mandatory BP. Just show up and play. I want the guys to be fresh.
@jamiesue21 we did....thank you much
Up and down lineup, our guys are working better ABs. This is not an anomaly road trip - I believe we can keep up this high level of play.
I like boring, no-chrome infielders. Ben Zobrist does that for us.
@WinstonCMaddon hey...check your email..
I'm offended that there were 2 winners in Elliot's lineup challenge today. I am too predictable. Thought Pena behind Kepp might throw em off
Evan was adamant again today that he felt great, and Port backed him up. His status is godspell: truly a day-by-day situation.
Heading to Manny's in Minneapolis tonight. Chateaubriand tastes better than meatloaf.
Zorilla is in at shortstop today. Wanted to get him, Keppinger and Roberts in the lineup together. We've been working on it covertly.
Tonight Alex had the best curve ball I have seen  all year by any of our pitchers.  It set up the whole game for him.
Really enjoyed first round of @egraphs. Listen to me talk wine http://t.co/1YVcrYGI - Thx for all the messages and I'm back with more avail.
@beetle282 thanks boys...enjoying right now...well done !
Looking at Longo today as a spark, not a savior.
Congratulations to the Family Upton on the dual 100th homers. Special moment for their parents.
. @rroberts19 told me I would have to get a tattoo if we played in the World Series. I'm in.
@SarahMaddon thank u honey....amazing memories..
@Kevin__Casey second best !
Helly was ill today but gutted it out for six. I made sure when he came out I high-fived his glove and not his hand.
Everything Matt did tonight was more reminiscent of last year. He had a real nice presence against a veteran lineup.
@RobTitoMoore Nice to hear from you. Thanks for saying hello.
@NeilDAmato got it thanks...brought it out west for kids to enjoy...best to all
@SarahMaddon shall
@SarahMaddon k...call me when u get close...prob have another 3 hours .
@SarahMaddon we have 40 min left...how u doin ?
@SarahMaddon no fun !
@SarahMaddon race you !
@SarahMaddon northern Alabama !
@SarahMaddon hey honey...we r somewhere over tennessee..c u soon !
Good start to the trip. 2 of 3 in Baltimore and kept guys fresh. Looking forward to seeing the family on west coast tonight.
We wish Hideki and his interpreter Roger Kahlon well. Hideki has a remarkable presence. A class act all the time. Hope our paths cross again
Great start to the road trip. Longo had a really good workout here today.
Out hitting is contagious the wrong way right now. We have to find a way to score. Good news: this trip is vs. 3  teams just ahead of us.
Outrageous job by the bullpen tonight and Shields had 10 punches and 2 walks against a team he has had trouble with in the past.
Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn is in the house tonight. Likeable fellow. http://t.co/7WjvZ3Bu
What a difference 16 hours makes and when JMolina steals a base you must win that game. David Price: high velocity, well located.
This egraph from Shields to @johncena is hysterical http://t.co/5M55zLRM.
I was very honored to meet Hideki's parents - Masao and Saeko Matsui -  this afternoon. http://t.co/YIAfPI5r
Tonight was a game of centimeters, but lots of good stuff especially the bullpen.  When we play well and lose, I go home feeling fine.
Thanx 2 everyone who helped make the Summer Social a great success. We raised $50K tonite for local charities.  Enjoyed visiting with u all.
Physically Shieldsy is fine. He's just been unable to execute his pitches. Probably trying to do too much which is true for a lot of guys.
Meatloaf would taste good today. Going with Matsui at DH. He's been stoning the ball during BP.
Welcome and congratulations to Richie Shaffer our first round pick from Clemson. http://t.co/qsPfCdqj
I like opening the 2nd half with 10 home games. Allows us to implement an extensive work plan for everyone with focus on the little things.
Had 20 players at today's voluntary workout. Our true identity is pitching and defense. We have to get back to that in the 2nd half.
And hey @modernwest, thanks again for meeting me at the trop. Here is my egraph to you http://t.co/nCzCpi2L
Hey @KeithOlbermann, pretty excited about http://t.co/nnDYjBhZ. My first one goes to you http://t.co/p4EeB4zk
Kyle is a big part of who we are and will continue to be.  He just had a hard time today. Can't be down. We just meatloafed the Yankees.
We are finally getting some big hits. They have been eluding us. Hitting ebbs and flows. The flow owes us right now.
At some point you have to cover your mistakes with your offense. We haven't been able to do that.
Earth, Wind and Fire in the house tonight. http://t.co/etZaCwRd
Better energy tonight. Could feel it in the dugout early even tho we were facing Verlander. Our starting pitching had a lot to do with that.
Had a gr8 talk today w/ Portland Trailblazers Head Coach Kaleb Canales. Good guy.  He's very interested in our Hazleton Integration Project.
With the bullpen thin tonight, what Cobb did was heroic in a baseball sense. It was an outstanding. Ask anyone in our clubhouse. Gutty.
Deepest sympathies to the family of Darrel Akerfelds. Darrel was a friend since 1982. Good man. Will be missed.
Sounds like with the weather back home there wasn't much 2 do except watch us on TV. Hope they found it entertaining. Pray everyone is ok.
Beanie and 90 volunteers representing our Hazleton Integration Project (HIP) are here today. http://t.co/TwAaoWiI
Really a pleasure to meet Temple Basketball Coach Fran Dunphy tonight before the game. Good man. http://t.co/3yKk1KpQ
You don't like to see them but you are going to make mental mistakes. Today we were just chock full of them. On to Philly via train.
You don't like to see them but you are going to make mental mistakes. Today we were just chock full of them.
Check out the throwback uniforms we will be wearing against the Tigers on June 30. http://t.co/20iNvQE0
My biggest concern for tonight is Joel Peralta. He's going to get vilified and he doesn't deserve that. It isn't right. Ask the players.
How cruel is it that Chris Archer has to face Stephen Strasburg in his major league debut? Grand mal cruel.
We had good energy today under the circumstances. You could feel it in the dugout. Alex Cobb had a lot to do with that.
@SarahMaddon thx to the world's bestest daughter....hugs to Tre, Tyler.....handshake will do with Theo....!
@JosephMaddon thank u my son ....  Am equally proud of you....happy father's day....and hugs to Nat and Coral
Happy Father's Day!
Tonight I enter into bobbleheadom. What an honor. The first 10,000 fans here tonight get one. http://t.co/TPOT0Chh
RA Dickey is good and he is really hot right now. Did you notice he was tipping his pitches?
Played our best game the other night in Miami. Tonight we played probably our worst of the season at home.
Matsui is in there tonight. It's his birthday. Sometimes you have to look beyond the stats and go with the birthday theory.
@RojasIngrid Thank you.
@McSwiller Stephen King's 11/22/63
We chose Rhymes to run down to the bullpen when the phone went out so we could get Badenhop and McGee up. Will had that Radar O'Reilly look.
Lots of Rays fans here. Outstanding. They may have seen us play our most complete game of the year.
@peoriachiefs miss my Peoria days...best to all Chief fans...very cool gesture....Pete Venochen rules !
They are not all oil paintings. Tonight was more like a paint-by- number job.
@SarahMaddon @josephmaddon thx honey !
@greeneyes0378. Thank you.
@Carigz03. Of course. Email you information to Rick at  rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
Added a bow tie from Dhani Jones for tonight's all-white themed trip from New York to Miami. http://t.co/VRSSj0vX
The defensive thing going on with us right now is like a virus. We're good defensively.  We'll come out of it but right now it's biting us.
@lquart3. Please send his  address to Rick Vaughn.  rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
@snrichardson13. No, but we are going with our annual all white attire trip from NY to Miami.
@JosephMaddon keeps getting better...if that's possible....my best to Mario upon your next visit..
@JosephMaddon wanting to photograph pipes is your Popo running thru your veins..!
Very honored to be participating in Yogi Berra's Golf Classic in NJ tomorrow. Yogi raised more than $325,000 for kids at last year's event.
@JosephMaddon outstanding everything buddy...am sure Nate feels fortunate to have met you too....
Made a friend 2day: Connor Bruseski. He's 7 and starts every day watching MLB Network's Quick Pitch. http://t.co/bVQvvQzL
Met 2 really cool people tonight. Bucs Head Coach Greg Schiano and BowTie Foundation's Dhani Jones. http://t.co/h315q1NB
Some really good news. Our trainer Ron Porterfield just gave Desmond a thumbs up. He'll begin a rehab assignment at Pt Charlotte tomorrow.
Our newest player led to one of our largest pregame media sessions.  He'll bat sixth tonight. http://t.co/QkZJeK76
Thank you to all veterans and their families for the sacrifices they have made for us. Never forget.
@CHECOPR kaenon...go online and check em out.....kaenon.com
Happy for Fernando today. Facing Saltalamacchia as the first hitter in the 9th was the perfect setup. He came out and pitched really well.
Congratulations to the USF softball team and coach Ken Eriksen. Best of luck next week in OK City. The Rays will be watching.
As I said earlier today to the writers I have lot of respect for Red Sox players and it showed up tonight. Great game by both teams.
Very proud of our effort 2nite. What occurred in the 9th reeked of intent. Was ridiculous, absurd, idiotic, incompetent, cowardly behavior.
@skipmilos that is perfect !
Kenny was waiting for us when we arrived at the hotel tonight. A true inspiration for our trip. http://t.co/eUx8P8HN
Heading for Boston. The guys are digging the nerd theme. The ties represent 18 different charities. http://t.co/obobEYYm
The Jays R playing at a very hi emotional level right now.  It makes our last 2 wins even more impressive. I admire the fight in our group.
In the end wins R all kinda beautiful actually, but that wasn't R game 2night. That has 2 stop. Even with guys hurt we're better than that.
Hitting Los leadoff. We've tried it with a few other guys and it worked. I want him to accept his walks, think of himself as a tablesetter.
Here is the nerd inspiration for road trip....my granddaughter Tyler...it was her idea...thx honey http://t.co/vPRCuhJL
Our next themed road trip:  the Ken Rosenthal/Nerd Road Trip to Boston...Bow ties included.
Going with Donna Summer music in the office today as a tribute to the Queen of Disco.
Thankfully Will is OK. Regarding injuries, it is pouring right now but our guys have their umbrellas up and it's OK.
@nathanjmurdock yes....great book...interesting read !
@etange thanks Eric...I have much more respect for how Your team operates !  come see us when u get home...stop by dugout...I will remember.
@SarahMaddon @namaddon highly kool !
@SarahMaddon hey honey...didn't know u were out there.....give my grandkids a kiss....
Happy Mother's Day Beanie from Joey. Wearing these pink Kaenon shades tomorrow for you. http://t.co/mgKIcsSh
my sympathies to the Carl Beane family....I always enjoyed our post game exchange in both victory and defeat....the Rays will miss him...
@JosephMaddon @nataliemaddon @namaddon hey Nat...Dali-like stuff...love it...you two must open a studio.....soon....
@Evan3Longoria near Yacht club on Davis Island...know it's fenced, not sure about the grass....
@uKeepCommission got it...thx
Regardless of the last 2 games it was a great homestand with a little adversity strapped to our backs.
Considering how hard we played tonight and how well we've been playing, we went mariachis postgame. http://t.co/hEUuXUpt
We are now 2-0 when the Tampa Chamber of Commerce helps assemble the lineup. BJ in the 2 hole was outstanding.  Thanks 2 for today's lunch.
2night's lineup (with help from Tampa Chamber Luncheon folks). Jennings 7 Upton 8 Pena 3 Joyce 9 Scott dh Zobrist 4 Rhymes 5 Molina 2 SRod 6
Heading for Tampa Chamber luncheon. Last year the folks at this luncheon helped make out the lineup for that night and we beat the Twins 5-2
We're not just a cookie cutter club. R guys have 2 do different things. Love it when everyone participates, takes ownership. 2day included.
Great to meet John Caparulo pregame today. Funny guy. http://t.co/kNYsuJq6
@TomSohnsDunmore cool....will c u then!
@TomSohnsDunmore u coming to Tampa ?
Wins like last night come from the support our players have for each other. It is what will help us fight thru Longo's absence.
Happy 1st bday to grandson Tre from me and Jaye... 4/29 missed congrats by few minutes...heard u had fun day !  We love you !
@JosephMaddon great shot buddy....keep pushing the artistic envelope....love it....will see what we can do tonight....
Apologies gang and Brandon,  must have the NFL on my mind. It is draft day. I of course meant Brandon Allen.
Brandon James had already made a great impression here conversationally, but then to do what he did today was something special.
@shelbysunshiine email rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
Our first themed road trip is coming up this weekend to Texas. Our minimalist trip...one pair of jeans, 3 shirts, one pair of shoes, etc.
Wonderful crowd support this weekend. A real pro-Rays crowd. Thank you. Also good to see Tony Oliva. http://t.co/H01ztvUj
Still not 100 percent on all cylinders but the esprit de corps is fabulous.
@JosephMaddon outstanding buddy...!!
Just landed. Glad to be home. I will take a 7-6 at this point considering our schedule.
Looking forward  to my bike ride along Bayshore tomorrow. Good time to think about the lineup with BJ back.
Moved Zorilla in front of Carlos and Longo tonight. Try to change his mindset a bit. He's a good on base guy. May give Longo/ Los more opps.
@usmcjpmarshello. Email RV at rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
Thanx 2 all 4 the kind words regarding win #500. I believe this is the best place 2 be. I'm just the steward of the group, reaping rewards.
Great clubhouse today before the game. Couldn't tell from our guys if we won 4 in a row or lost 4 in row.
Jackie's day today. One of the most significant people in the last century. http://t.co/zbdiFRfp
We had a lot well struck balls today. They just didn't fall.  Didn't realize it was Friday the 13th until afterward.
@JosephMaddon just call me "windy"  !
@JosephMaddon don't b using my lines about u...love...Fasha
Thanks to all for ideas on the themed trips.  Like Mad Men and the seersucker suit ideas. Considering Thurston Howell III trip.
Just landed in Detroit 4 our first road series. Need ideas 4 themed dress trips. Coach Stan Boroski offered up this: dress like your hero.
Fan support at the Trop for the 3 game series was righteous. Thanks to all. Enjoy what's left of the Easter weekend!
@MichelleMaddon hey Missy..happy Easter to u and your family...remind me to tell u my Uncle Chuck Easter memory !  Remember like yesterday!
Shannon Magrane in the house  to sing the anthem tonight. She's part of the Rays family. So proud. http://t.co/j5dELzP5
U want 2 know the difference between spring training and the first game? Today had the intensity of a midseason game. Tribute to both teams.
Here is tomorrow's lineup: Jennings 8, Zobrist 9, Longoria 5, Keppinger dh, Rodriguez 6, Johnson 4, Pena 3, Molina 2, Joyce 7, Shields 1.
In spite of injuries, thought we had a great spring. Loved our effort and the play of our minor leaguers who participated. It's the Ray Way.
@Chooch2730 Kaenon sunglasses....from Newport Beach CA...check em out online...
Last spring home game (our 6th tie!).  Thanx again Charlotte County for your support/hospitality. Will miss all especially River City Grill.
At our 4th Annual BaseBALL in Punta Gorda this evening with the coaches. Hoping to raise a lot of $ for Charlotte County Boys/Girls Club.
Channeling my inner Jane Fonda at BP today. Also honoring ABA greats George Gervin, Dan Issel, Dr J. http://t.co/L94uI9Dp
Met Maddie tonight after the game. What a sweetheart. http://t.co/Vz06S2H6
Just told Jeff he will be in the rotation and Wade in the pen. 1 of the most difficult decisions I've had here. We think so highly of both.
@DickieV  see u there buddy....best to your family...
Best part of the day were those Mudders the B Street Band. They played pregame after playing in Tampa last nite. Day game after a nite game.
Met former San Diego State middle infielder Armen Keteyian who was here today with HBO Real Sports. We both thank u for being u Coach Dietz!

@SMagraneAI11 U are welcome ...we are with you all the way...best to family Magrane !
"Fortune favors the bald." Shaving our heads on 3/15 to pay tribute to children battling cancer: http://t.co/35e8aC4v (@pediatriccancer).
My takeaway from 2day was how hard we ran to 1st. 2 things coming tomorrow. Will announce opening day starter and plans for a new hairstyle.
@DickieV hey buddy...looking forward to seeing you at the Trop....also running with USF Bulls into tourney...
We still have a few bumps and bruises but its better to have them early. Taking a conservative approach. All should be well within a week.

As part of our Adopt-A-Legend program we are glad to have former major league lefty Dave LaPoint here today as a coach.
@DaveGallagher22 hey Dave...great to hear from you...thx for the good wishes...you played the game right !
For tomorrow's 1st full squad meeting I don’t need to say much. They're on a good path. Their minds are in a good place. They’re motivated.

Make sure you get the Maddonini Chicken at River City Grill when you come to see us play at Charlotte Sports Park this spring.
As first days of spring training go, it's nice to see everyone so prepared. Players, staff worked so hard in offseason. It really shows.
ultimate goal is to make an impact within surrounding communities too....one step at a time...

@TPM10454_SERIE5. English Bull Dog
First roster addition of the offseason. Winston Churchill Maddon the 1st. http://t.co/ibcb0iha
Thanks to all for your support this season. So many of you didn't give up either. Love you for it.
Had a postgame toast in the clubhouse. Told them I couldn't be more proud. Back in April I toasted to the best 0-6 team ever. I was right.
We said at the beginning of the year we were going to have to find another way. We're set up to do that.
Joel Peralta's wife made some great Dominican food for the spread today. She's a great cook.
Regarding the recipe: rumor has it chocolate icing is involved.
@herkflyerc130 thank you.
@Miss_Meliss25. You can email our PR director Rick Vaughn at rvaughn@raysbasball.com
@df3ns thank you.
@bruce_solo. Thank you.  You can contact our PR director Rick Vaughn at rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
@Mleatherb. Stay tuned.
@raysnspurs. We'll work on that. Thanks for the suggestion.
If you have a second check out joesthanksmas.com. Just launched today. It's an issue I care deeply about.
Optional workout tomorrow. I am fine if they want to get a day of rest, have a nice dinner and be ready to go Monday. Loved the vibe 2nite.
Regarding the cake: has anyone found that recipe... again.
Love the support from Guy and the Boys.  Wish them the best next Friday in the opener. http://t.co/paVxWG2e
In today's game u don't often see 37 year old Hall of Famers running hard to first like Johnny did 2day. Twice. That's what stood out 4 me.
We heard someone left the cake out in the rain. Trying to find out who.
Can't express enough gratitude to Buck and the Os for their incredible professionalism. We don't do this without their respect for the game.
It's in our hands. Yankees have their A lineup out there but I think its within us. We just have to go do it.
It was fun to listen to the joy in the clubhouse after tonight's game. I enjoy just sitting in my office taking it in. We're really into it.
Didn't watch last night's Red Sox-Yankees game. Spent too much emotional energy yesterday on our game and wanted to save some for tonight.
Tomorrow is now the most important game of the year like 2day was. So proud of our guys. Big nite tonite. Season premier of Boardwalk Empire
How about the two Tampa Bay teams winning today? Bucs and Rays won last Sunday.
The frosh did a great job tonight. They earned their lettermen sweaters. What Alex did was above and beyond. He has AL East makeup.
Want to give a shoutout to my son for competing in the 10K obstacle run in Phoenix. Proud of you Joey.
@GeoffHunter2. Thanks Geoff. Love my hometown.
Did nothing well 2nite. We R running out of time quickly but there still is time. If we can pull it off it will b a once-in-a-lifetime thing
Just landed at St Pete Clearwater Airport.  Hope the Trop is energized. We thrive on it. Take Stu up on his offer of free parking today.
There is no way I could be prouder of our team to this point but by no means do I think we're out of it. Win tomorrow and we go home 2 out.
Shieldsy was great, but we have to file that one away and move on. We have another game in a few minutes.  Win tonight and its not so awful.
Lost opportunity but then again with the Orioles winning not so bad.
Going to be without Zorilla tonight. His wife Julianna just gave birth to a baby girl. We'll adjust. Everybody plays here.
Launched an important initiative today - the Hazleton (PA)Integration Project.  This is all about bringing my hometown together.
Boarding the train from Boston to New York tonight. Our guys just get it! http://t.co/k7FySlYe
Fantastic the way our guys can drop Friday's game in the trash can and play like that. Already playing playoff ball. So many growth moments.
We didn't just play ok tonight, we played great. Loved our tenacity. We'll be back tomorrow.
Damon's team defeated Price's in the Rays staff home run hitting contest early today at Fenway. Fun. http://t.co/Bllxx1fl
Now it's about Friday. We have to think in those terms. It's the only way we are going to do this. We need to stay in the present tense.
This series should bring out the best in all of us. I feel good about it.
No speeches planned to the players, but I got a bigger speaker for my office  so the guys could hear my music in the clubhouse.
We definitely missed an opportunity. It doesn't mean its over. You take 30 minutes and get over it. Then get on the plane and get up there.
Going with our lettermen sweaters tonight on the trip to Boston.
Our playoffs started last Friday against Boston. There can be no let up now from any of us.
Like to use Matt Moore kinda like we did with Price in 08. Let's see if history can repeat itself. The games will dictate how we use him.
@NomieShock. AMEN!
We're kinda fun to watch right now. Our guys believe. They don't need any speeches from me. I need to get out of the way and let them play.
Thoughts today are of Neil Levin a frat brother who we lost at the World Trade Ctr. He wanted to be the governor of NY. He would have been.
I love that everyone is involved and believes. Everyone is utilized. It's who we R. How about the young guys 2night- McGee, Ramos and Gomes?
We're going with Rays lettermen sweaters for the road trip. Julia Alarcon did a great job on them. http://t.co/uUbCT5R
@wjwaldron Letter sweaters coming Sunday.
@wjwaldron
We do believe. There are going to be skeptics and this was just 1 win. We know we have 2 show em again tomorrow but it had 2 begin tonight.
Had some extra members on hand for the pregame media chat today. http://t.co/xk1ppG8
We want to be like the guys in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Relentless pursuers who prompted the line: Who are those guys?
Today I met heroes Capt Mark Bogush and Lt Roger Picard from Tampa Fire Rescue. They were at ground zero with their search dogs 10 yrs ago.
Completely different game 2night but we have a chance to meatloaf em tomorrow and if we can win 2 of 3 vs Texas right now we shud feel good.
@CuzzinBailey thank you.
@BigBadEd. Thank you.
@aussiegriff. Thanks. Hope to.
We're 14 games over .500 because of starting pitching like today. There's no hiding that fact.
Everyone wants to talk about the Rangers offense and it is really really good, but we have to figure out a way to score some runs vs. them.
My thoughts and prayers go out to Leroy Selmon's family and friends. A terrible, terrible loss for our community.
How about Helly? 12 wins and ERA under 3. That's a rookie pitching in the AL East. With a little luck he would have 15 wins and probably ROY
So glad to hear Leroy Selmon improving. Such a good man. He'll battle thru this. He spoke to our team in 08. Softspoken. Class. A gentleman.
Parker Lentini from Make-A-Wish helped me with the media pregame today. He excelled. He is 11. http://t.co/iAeq0Ly
They beat us with our own stick tonight. Defense and pitching. Like looking in a mirror.
We get to vote on Gold Glove today but we can't select our own players. Can't wait for the day Rawlings gives out a team Gold Glove Award.
Paul Bonomo, my PAL basketball coach in Hazleton, used to drive us around in his '64 Impala. He'll be missed. My condolences to his family.
Ha! 1978, La Canada Golf Course, Carmel CA. RT @JosephMaddon Love my old man. He looks like Wario from Mario Brothers. http://t.co/CnMw7VD
Heard that Sean's homer yesterday came off the bat at 122.2 mph, the quickest of any HR hit this season, by far. That's severe.
I think that it's perfectly fitting that #14 had 14 k's. His fastball had exceptional movement today.
Outstanding staff dinner @ Morton's. Hickey was a garbage disposal, finished a few leftover steaks. We sang Happy Anniv to couple next 2 us.
Our starting pitching has been righteous lately. I think it's due in part to the extra rest they got when we had a 6-man rotation.
Not a high-stress game for Shields, so I felt good about 125 pitches. He looked good until the very end.
On my 26th b-day I was done playing and about to start my first season of coaching. It's good to be David Price right now.
@bunky4 Thank you.
For all the Rays watching in the minor leagues that hustle by Sean tonight is what we are looking for. It's what we want everybody to do.
Our writers asked me about the players poll in SI. It's a humbling thought that ML players would say that about me. Credit our organization.
@Tom_Wight. We will not.
The positives so outweighed the negatives tonight. We just couldn't get a key hit.
Just taped a PSA for the "It Gets Better Campaign."  Rays R standing up against bullying of LGBT youth. If it's 1 thing I hate it's a bully.
Good pitcher's duel. We blinked. They came out on top. Verlander's 19-5 for a reason. We played well. They just out-pitched us tonight.
Giving Desmond the day off. Joyce in the leadoff spot. Going to stack the top of the order with lefties against Verlander. .
@ratwood14. Send it to Rick Vaughn our PR Director. Tropicana Field. St Petersburg, FL 33705.
@sfintampa Thanks for the wine. Can't wait to try it. Looks like it will be very good postgame.
Wore the Bucs helmet in the postgame press conference 2day. A tribute 2 our friends at 1 Buc Place. http://t.co/5zfclyz
I like Longo's mechanics right now. He could get toasty the rest of the way. He's up to 72 RBI now. With him that's what I look for.
We're going to back off BP this homestand. Want players coming 2 the park later, doing less 2 keep fresh. Want them ready at 710 not 310.
Just taped a PSA 4 the Fishing for Hearts Tournament on 10/ 14. Benefits Ronald McDonald House/Athletes 4 Hearts. Go to Fishingforhearts.com
@sfintampa. Thank you. Please email our PR director Rick Vaughn at rvaughn@raysbaseball.com.
@_TomBennett. Very cool.
Damon going hard to 1st was the play of the game 2nite. He sets the example 4 every1 else. Was a "want to" game. We wanted 2 win and we did.
@DickieV. You got it. Will have it brought to your seat.
Met a lot of great fans at the Bucs game last nite. Appreciate you. Had a screen pass in my back pocket if Raheem had asked to call a play.
@Flydadee. Bucs of course!
Off today.  Going to go watch Raheem and the boys take on the Patriots tonight.
3 3-hitters in a row that's outrageous. The possibility of a really good run is there with pitching like that. We are not going to give up.
Really love that a difficult loss this afternoon doesn't inhibit us from playing well in the second game. It's who we are.
@njnovo. Cool. Call Rick Vaughn 7274390671. He can arrange.
Today we R seeing 2 of the better lefties stuff-wise in the AL over the last few years. Makes it tough 2 put together a lineup 4 each game.
@DaCoug. Something different. I love it.
On the train to Boston. Found a new friend Zach. The fedoras are a hit! http://t.co/JWr33Q2
Rained out here today. We don't need this extra time off, but Mother Nature says u get 2 days off. We'll go with Shields/Niemann on Tues.
We just didn't pitch well today. That's not us. We'll just have to Meatloaf 'em tomorrow. Rock and Roll.
@MzCSmith  Claire, appreciate your kind words. Hope you are well.
Tough, tough loss for the kids from New Tampa LL last night. So close. Like to invite them to take BP at Tropicana Field when we get back.
Home runs off CC tonight were welcomed but the defense by Sean, EJ, and Kotch was righteous.
Went to a little hole in the wall for dinner last night: the Pearl Oyster Bar near NYU. Outstanding dining experience.
Again, if u weren't entertained by our defense today then u don't like baseball. How about Desmond's standup triple? Shortest in ML history.
@Chandler813 Sorry just saw this. Contact Rick Vaughn in our pr office when you come out again. rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
@kdlovering. Thank you.
@bionole. We won't take BP on the field tomorrow.
Congrats to New Tampa LL on the win 2nite. Good luck in the region finals. Get to Williamsport and hoagies from the 3rd Base Dugout R on me.
The 9th inning was rollercoaster-esque. The process/thinking wasn't good in the top of the 9th but the bottom was a testament to this group.
Had Fuld in leadoff spot tonight then decided to put Joyce there. Kinda like what we did with Longo earlier. Des will be in there tomorrow.
@bengalralph. Nothing yet. Believe me we love him, too.
@TheMarkFisher. Yes.
@TampaCarla. You have to go to the Base. The Third Base Dugout Restaurant. Ask for Beanie.
When u play "D" like that it permits your starter to throw a shutout. Without some of those plays Shieldsy may not have the chance to finish
Next road trip we're taking the train from NY to Boston. We're wearing 50s style hats saluting the train travel endured by Zim's 55 Dodgers.
@ASilvvx3. Please give him a huge group hug from the Rays.
The whole dugout knew right away Kotch's HR was going out. That's saying something considering how the ball hasn't been carrying to center.
The game of inches showed up in a negative way for us but I really liked the fight we showed late. David just didn't have a good look today.
McCarthy did the exact same thing to us 2nite that he did in Oakland. This was all about him. Goo Goo Dolls were the best part of the nite.
@ovi1006. Like to go at least an hour.
@pattycox. Thanks, Patty. RV says hi.
@PaulcCov. Thank you.
Our guys R coming 2 the park with a little more believabilty. They're believing again.  Nice vibe in the dugout. Need 2 pickup1 game a week.
Finally starting to feel better from this head cold. Got in my first bike ride of the homestand today.
@mattmaddix. Will do. Thank you.
Jaye and I want to thank everyone who came to the Maddon Summer Social after today's game.  We raised a lot of money for charity. Great day!
2 good wins in a row; a blowout then a game when we have 2come from behind 3 times. Those can build momentum. Heading 2 Maddon Summer Social
@GregsHighway. Much.
Just told the writers that last nite was one of the better moments we've had since I've been here in terms of everybody doing things right.
If u r coming to this weekend's series vs As please donate to the Rays Wives backpack/school supplies drive 2 benefit PACE Center for girls.
From a purist's perspective seeing a team execute the way we did tonight had to be fun to watch. We played small ball and big ball.
One thing about our lack of offense at home: it proves we're not cheating.
From a pitchers perspective I'm sure they feel like they can't make a mistake. Have to keep pounding on that offense door until it opens up.
Meant to say, Angels losing our big lead in '95 is still fresh in my mind. Seattle's comeback that year could happen again. I'm a believer.
Seattle is not the same without the Supersonics, as far as I'm concerned. Lenny Wilkens, Spencer Haywood, Jack Sikma...fantastic.
Buente picked up our pen tonight. After his first inning, he came back to the dugout & I finally met him: "Nice going. I'm Joe."
So happy for Bert Blyleven. He had HOF ability to light someone's shoelaces on fire. He'd crawl under benches, thru mud, whatever it took.
Johnny offered to play field last night so I pulled BJ to get him off his feet. Rumors never crossed my mind. Wish I was that devious!
We didn't do anything well tonight. Lots of mistakes. Looking forward to tomorrow so we can play the Rays brand of baseball again.
Came out of the gauntlet 4-6. Thinking how easily things cud have shifted. Luv that our mood didn't change. ETA into KC 1/2 bottle of wine.
Angelo Dundee here today. Tells me he watches every one of our games.
Garcia out-experienced us tonight. We had opportunities with the right hitters at the plate.  It just didn't happen.
We've played the same game the past 3 nights. We won tonight but you saw the same intensity, the same pitching, the same effort each night.
Even though its been tough lately with the wins and losses, there is a nice vibe about our group that I appreciate.
Talked last year about the very thin line between winning and losing at this level. Right now we are on the wrong side of that thin line.
Made a few moves today. Chirinos and Torres just arrived. Chirinos will be in the lineup tonight. Want to get him in there right away.
Very proud of our guys. My take-away from tonight is that we can beat the Red Sox and the Red Sox know it.
Had to scratch Joyce from the  lineup. His knee swelled up and is stiff from yesterday's foul ball. He may be able to pinch hit tonight.
We had a chance to salt that one away early and didn't do it.  Can't expect Shieldsy to be so sharp every time out.
We're on FOX 2day. Just met with Tim McCarver and Dick Stockton. Shared with them my idea about a team Gold Glove award. Think they dug it.
How about Farns? Another save of more than 1 inning and he did it in a frugal manner. So important to us.
It's not about making physical adjustments in the 2nd half its about making mental adjustments and finding a more mature level of playing.
Johnny Damon hosting a wine event on Saturday to benefit the fallen St Pete police officers. Get tix at uncorkforacause.com. Nice red blend.
Met with the team 2day be4 workout. Talked specifics on what we have 2 do 2 get better. We have high xpectations. Postseason xpectations,
Real reason we didn't want the doubleheader? I had dinner reservations tonight. Been looking forward to it for months!
Jeter might get hit # 3000 against us. Doesn't bother me but his team can derive energy from it. That happened when I saw Cal pass Gehrig.
@buckymckrakin. Yes, sir.
Wore a Zorilla t-shirt in the postgame presser today. Vote for Zo in the last man voting for the All Star game. Need a Farnsworth shirt too.
It was fun to tell our 3 all-stars that they made the team. I believe we still have a chance at further representation. Think Farnsworth.
Better energy tonite. Plus what Niemann and Ruggiano did was pretty spectacular. Ruge had the great catch and really crushed that home run.
My Annual Summer Social is Aug 4 after our day game vs Toronto. Players will b there. It's fun. It's 4 charity. Go 2 raysbaseball.com 4 more
Frustrating loss tonight. Felt like I had to stand up for our guys. Still, we have to score more runs. We have to do better at home.
Its cool that the Cardinals are here. They played a big part in my development as a baseball fan and as a kid growing up.
@PDG777. Probably Anaheim because I get to go home.
Off day today, first at home in almost 2 months.  Sleep. Bike Ride. The only things on my agenda.
Shieldsy getting his 4th straight complete game today would be quite an accomplishment against this lineup. They are very good.
While we were taping the bike safety PSA today a helmet-less biker crashed right in front of us. He was unhurt but riding in the wrong lane.
Just taped a PSA for bike safety on Bayshore. Thanks to Mary Helen Duke 4 caring so much about this. http://yfrog.com/ke9p4gcj
Played poorly but appreciate guys always playing hard. Frustrating not hitting at home especially since we've been kinda spiffy on the road
Farnsworth definitely shuld b on the all-star team. He's a pitcher not just a thrower. Good slider and curveball not just about his fastball
Great trip. Ready to go home. Wish we cud take this ballpark w/ us. Its so good. Still, like the idea of biosphere that includes a ballpark.
We were all over the map today but I really enjoy the games when everyone gets involved and contributes. NL games are a blast.
Looking back I think the biggest play of the game last nite was the first one: Kotch's pickup on the throw from EJ. Maybe a different game.
Nothing I can say 2night. That was all Shields. Never had the privilege of watching something like this before: 6 CGs before the break.
@sfintampa. Spanish reds.
The U.S. Men's Soccer team was at our hotel here in Houston the first day. Good luck to the boys on Saturday.
@CamTracy3_24. Loved it
David went to the uber level today and he knew he had 2 against a team that has a lot of fight especially in this building. Great vibe here.
We're going to stick with an unconventional plan today against Marcum. Righthanded lineup with switch hitters hitting righty.
Way too many walks tonight.
Innocent mistake last night. Trying to have Sam warm up to give Ramos more time. Just a misunderstanding between Bob and me. No shenanigans.
How about Longo tonight? He was out for early work today and was crushing the ball. He's a grinder. He's going to get hot, real hot.
@TheFFAddict. Sorry we missed you.
If that effort doesn't put Shields in the all-star game I don't what will. Five CGs before the break. How about that?
Played a lot of Springsteen in the office today in honor of Clarence. Lafayette College + Rosalita equalled many great nights for me.
Alex pitched well.He's going to b very good,but sending him 2 Durham 2night.Has to happen sometimes.Good 4 him and 4 us. Speaks 2 our depth.
Coming off 3 tightly wound games vs the Red Sox, I was really pleased with the way we played 2night. A nice, tidy game against a good club.
@jordongrangruth. Keep it fun for the kids and yourself.
Worked on bunt defense today before BP.  Players had some good input. They're not afraid to tell me what they think. Love that.
David just didn't seem to have his better stuff tonight. Velocity on the fastball was off. Still he competed and gave us 5 on a tough nite.
We had the Lightning's Thompson, Stamkos, Smith, Purcell out for BP today. Impressed with their competitiveness.Smitty ended it with a blast
I loved Helly tonite. He battled toe-to-toe with a great pitcher. He and Beckett were wearing the heavy gloves and Helly didn't flinch.
Welcomed Darren O'Donnell to the Trop tonight.  My hero. He's biking to all 30 major league parks. http://yfrog.com/kllrirj
I'm not sure what else Shields could do to prove he belongs on the All-Star team. A performance like tonight should galvanize that.
Alex was good tonight, his change-up was extraordinary. Very composed as usual - he and Helly are cut from same lack-of-emotional cloth.
Here's a picture of the brown bag lunch. Hoagies are as advertised, with a nice little kick. http://yfrog.com/h3eakejj
My treat on the flight: paper bag lunches with hoagies (from my mom Beanie's 3rd Base Luncheonette in Hazleton), fruit roll-ups, and juice.
Extra inning wins on the road speak to our professional attitude. They keep an even keel and keep grinding. Perfect example of 9=8.
Extending this sleep deprivation trip, I'm so proud of how we battled back tonight. Outstanding effort. All 9 players on field contributed.
Sweltering tonight. Guys were still dragging a bit, I could see it in their faces, but they fought. Should be full strength tomorrow.
Rain delay in BAL. Loved the creativity of the pajamas on flight here. Only encourages me to keep the theme trips going. Thx 4 your input!
Rick Reichardt asked me to catch his ceremonial first pitch tonight at Angel Stadium. Should be fun, but I can't squat all the way down.
Got cut off - Joey is @josephmaddon
Check out this photo taken by my son Joey. See more of his work at http://josephmaddonphotography.com @josephmaddo http://twitpic.com/56zhp1
Nobody loves his alma mater more than Darin Erstad loves Nebraska. His return there is based purely on his love of the game & the University
Ready 4 our grunge trip to Seattle. Our guys look the part. M's are playing well. Not a bad thing. Good teams can bring out the best in us.
Sloppy game tonight. Not happy with that, but came from behind three times and still won. Who let the dawgs out?
Jimbo Fisher is here tonight. Really enjoyed meeting him and his wife Candi and boys Trey and Ethan, who has a terrific arm for a 6-yr -old.
Did an interview just now with the Kids in Charge Advisory Board from MOSI-the Museum of Science and Industry. Great kids. Great questions.
@ChelleBelles8 @VirgoLotus thoughts and prayers are with you. get well soon and hope to see you at the Trop.
If there's a part of our game that's been missing its the walk component. Part of getting better is accepting BBs. BJ, Longo did that today.
Thanx to all for your gr8t themed trip ideas. Going with a combination of them on next trip: grunge to Seattle, beachwear to LA, PJs to Balt
The way we are going offensively right now we're not able to cover our mistakes. Not turning the DP in the eighth was a big turning point.
Hitting Longo leadoff today. With him struggling a bit, I want him to take his walks, get on base, hit the ball up the middle. Have fun.
Congrats to Guy Boucher and the Lightning on a great season. Like to invite them out Tropicana Field and express those sentiments in person.
Today's rainout not a bad thing.  A few guys are struggling. Maybe by the time the game is played we'll be a little friskier at the plate.
I will take the way we played tonight any day. They beat is with the home run ball. But I thought we played well.
Just taped a scoreboard promo for the Lightning game  tomorrow night. It would be nice to get home in time tomorrow to catch it.
I dig the effort but we just have to do better at taking advantage of scoring opportunities. Tonight was another example of that.
Our white out trip heading for Detroit.  Stress-free. Just like Shields today. He was like watching Sinatra perform at the Sands in Vegas.
Lot of good things are happening we just have to be more consistent at the plate.
Honestly I wish  Josh Johnson was pitching Sun. He and Shieldsy would be a great matchup. I'm sure Shields finds the change more palatable.
@Yanksnation25. It is for the John Challis Foundation John was a young man I met in July 2008. He passed away from cancer.
@Tampa1026. Contact Rick Vaughn at rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
Its been kinda chirpy in the clubhouse 2day. Think it has something 2 do with JP Howell's return. Every team wants 1 of him. Gr8t teammate.
Ok, we have our all-white trip on Sunday. I am looking for some ideas for future themed dress trips. Give me a good one and we'll do it.
To clarify what I said about Davis last night: he was better than he had been lately. Didn't mean he pitched better than Romero. Thanks
2night was an innocuous game in many ways except for pitching. Quick snappy game-circa 1950. Romero was typically efficient. Davis better.
No such thing as an ugly win but tonight wasn't exactly an oil painting. More like a finger painting.
A thought about Harmon Killebrew today. Whenever I was with him he was so gracious and humble he made ME feel like I was the Hall of Famer.
The Brooklyn Superbas are dust.
Getting ready for our next themed trip. We're going w/ our all-white look from FLA to DET. Then a salute to the Motor City on our way home.
Crowds were gr8 this weekend. But may have seen a little fatigue in us. Players will report later Monday. No BP. Like American Legion ball.
Today was last night in reverse except Bergesen was more economical. Don't have any real answers as 2 why we're not hitting better at home.
I plan on sticking around for Darius Rucker after the game. He's great plus he said some nice things about us in the St Pete Times today.
We're going to do some early defensive work today to go over  little basic things. Re-work some of the stuff from spring training.
So pleased with our effort every day - they always come ready to play. I just have to sit there and make a decision every once in a while.
One of our mottos is "we catch line drives." The sophistication of putting guys in the right spots on the field is big for us.
Brandon Guyer is a great kid. Waited til this AM to tell him he's getting sent down so he could go out and enjoy the night with his family.
Zobrist is officially toasty. Love his approach right now, staying inside ball and stroking it to left-center. Gorgeous.
Definition of "baseball guy" is often skewed. Our group that scouts/evaluates is among best ever, regardless of age or whether they played.
We kind of like inclement weather. Played well in the snow in Minnesota and won. Tonight we got poured upon and no one complains. Love it.
On the plane getting ready for the flight to Baltimore. Good win today. David bounced back from his last outing with a dominant fastball.
If ever a play screamed for instant replay we saw it at first base in the 7th inning tonight. I think Joe West got it right the first time.
On this road trip, we're going with Navy Seal Team 6 T-shirts as a nod to the teamwork of the Seals. We'll top it off w/ our Lightning caps.
That was pretty cool. They post the Lightning score on the board then we go single, homer. BJ's ball had a nice draw like he hits on the GC.
We got our Babe back, our number 3 tonight. The guys played Rays -kind-of-baseball while he was gone  and its why we won more than we lost.
Intense series with LA. Today was the 2nd time we let a lead slip away. We have 2 do better. Day off Monday is our 1st at home in a month.
Looking back on Saturday Kotchman's at-bat in the 10th was underrated. He moved Joyce to 3rd. When you can move a runner 90 ft I like that.
We're giving away Joe Maddon banks to the 1st 10k kids Sunday. Bank is better looking. I'm honored at the attempt of replicating this face!
Really good effort tonight. Our guys don't quit. Got home at 5 am and you wouldn't know it.  Angels are like us with their defense.
Got in from Minnesota around 5 am and an hour later found out my daughter Sarah had a baby boy --Tre Joseph who is a healthy  8 LBs 3 oz.
Never seen 10 RBI in 1 day. Zorilla and the middle of the order stepped up. So did our starters. Getting on plane. Can't wait to get warm.
@MaggieMay1004. Email our PR Director Rick Vaughn rvaughn@raysbaseball.com
We're playing with great energy. Its been a tough trip. Got to Toronto late. The weather here not optimal. But the guys have a great look.
@greenless. Houston ballpark worth seeing.
Also congrats to Lightning on their win tonite after being down 3 gms to 1. We're proud of 'em and will continue to root 'em on. Great win,
Weather 2night was right there with Game 5 of WS in Philly but it felt warmer after the 1st inn. Terrible nite but we played like it was 75.
Rain/snow showers here likely tonight. Appreciate the Twins postponing it early. Players worked out inside Target Field. Longo looked good.
Shields continues to keep it simple and the results are obvious.  Looking forward to the offday in Minn tomorrow. Happy Easter everyone.
@tsatdukut. Happy Easter to you as well
Under the radar today was Damon's strikeout in the 6th. He worked a long at-bat vs Morrow 2 get him 2 his pitch limit. We follow w/ walk/HR.
Great energy. Especially for getting in to Toronto so late last night. Good ballgame McDonald is just our kryptonite.
Like the expanded playoff idea esp 4 us in the East. 1 negative is it wud extend the season but lets  resurrect  traditional doubleheaders.
My takeaway is we just won 6 of 8 on the homestand vs very good competition. Now off to Canada for our first themed trip: Lighting apparel.
Damon will be in there tonight. Talked to him last night and he was adamant about playing.
We've been playing really complete games the last week but it begins with our starting pitching. How about Joyce's catch too?
Shieldsy hit 95 in the 9th. Never seen him do that. This could do a lot for him. Defense again. Its contagious.
@wynams. Maybe tomorrow.
We're going with Lightning caps and T-shirts to Toronto on Thurs in support of the boys. I know Guy will have them ready tomorrow night.
@fllady61. The fans that were at the park tonight. They were awesome!
The 10th man was great 2nite. The fans were really appreciative of our defense.  It was so much fun to watch. We build momentum from our D.
Twins outfield played great defense this afternoon. When it happens against you, you appreciate it too.
Grind, grind, grind...I like the way we are doing that. It's all about attitude.
JP Howell threw a live BP session today for 10 mins. Look and felt real good. Will throw again on Tuesday here at the Trop. So far so good.
Thanks to the Tampa Chamber for their help. They were adament about hitting Joyce 3rd at today's lunch. 3 hits 2nite. He'll be in there Sat.
Asked the folks at the Tampa Chamber lunch today to help me make out 2night's lineup:  fuld, damon, joyce, lopez, BJ, S-Rod, DJ, Shop Brig
I like hard work and I like fun and Johnny epitomizes that. Big lift tonight.
Wearing MacDill on my jersey for the next 3 days in honor of MacDill Air Force Base. We are celebrating their 70th birthday here Saturday.
Getting ready to board our charter for the flight home from Boston. Going to spend the flight reading Malcolm Gladwell's "What the Dog Saw."
The rain gives us a 3-3 trip. After the start we had really happy.  Don't like rain but good news: we fly out at 8p and will get home early
@Guarton. Congratulations Molly on five years cancer free!!  Way to go!!!
Loved David's tenacity tonight.  He kept coming after the Sox hitters.  That's him.
The legend of Sam Fuld tweets are so good. Love "Superman wears Sam Fuld pajamas to bed" and "USF being renamed University of Sam Fuld."
We attacked 1st pitches 2night. Speaks to Sam's integrity that he didn't stop at 1st to get the cycle in the 9th. Its what he's all about.
Upset with umps bc the 1B ump said Floyd juggled the ball and an ump 100 ft away overruled. Galarraga shud have been perfect based on that.
Slice it anyway u want, we're just not hitting. What our players need from me is support/ patience. I see our guys working hard, caring.
@ejevan. No I am not. Send some info on it to our PR people attention Rick Vaughn. Thanks.
Love the way everybody contributed tonight. That's what we have to be;  the entire team partaking in a victory.  Love it!
A great player retired, but I believe it is a galvanizing moment for us.
@75adam. Thanks for your support. It helps!
@s0ulf1nger. Thanks for your support. It helps!
@Raynaadi thanks very much.
Edwin had better command today then in his no-hitter against us last year. We weren't pressing, he was that good. We will work thru this.
We've gotten a little better at playing in these  conditions. The experience of playing in the postseason in October weather has helped.
Cold and foggy in Chicago. I am going Elmer (Fudd) with the headgear for their opener today.
George Brett once said  sometimes you have to try easier. I think we are at that point. We can't try any harder than we are right now.
I know we're. 0-4 but I am not displeased with the way we are playing. We are just not hitting.  We will hit.
@SchmuckStop. That's wrong.
Tech Sgt Bell is showing us the MRE packs which are Meals Ready to Eat for the troops. I can see Bobby Ramos stocking the bullpen with them.
MacDill and the people here are amazing.   We are baseball players these guys are defending our country. We know who the real heroes are.
Excited to meet soldiers this morning at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. Even the rain can't ruin this. Very cool.
@jsculerati. I like to but hard to schedule much during the season.
I like the way we got after it but u can't win scoring 1 run a game. The O's pitched well, played good defense and got some timely hitting.
Longo likely headed for DL. Find another way.
Elliot Johnson won our Al Lopez award today for top rookie of the spring. He deserved it. He came in ready to play. He'll be in there Sunday
Tonight was a proverbial tip of the cap to Guthrie. He was that good.
Time to tee it up.  The first day-no matter how many times u experience it-gives u butterflies anyone says they don't feel it isn't truthful
Here's our Opening Day lineup Zobrist 2b. Damon lf. Longoria 3b Ramirez dh. Johnson 1b. Upton cf Joyce rf Brignac ss. Jaso c. Price p
We'll make the OD starting lineup official tomorrow. But expect no surprises. Liked our effort tonight. Will take the same on Friday nite.
Roster set for Opening Day. Bullpen is Peralta, Russell, Farnsworth, Cruz, McGee, Sonnanstine and Ramos.
Rained out tonight in Tampa. Disappointing because we wanted to stretch the position players out tonight. But it was the right call.
@tampa2drew. Thank you.
Heading over to Punta Gorda tonight for our annual dinner to benefit the Charlotte Boys and Girls Club.
We've had great attention to detail all spring but I talked to the team today about the mental mistakes we made Friday. Can't be that team.
Former Cubs great Glenn Beckert is dressing out with us today as an honorary coach. Nice man. Just met him last week. Lives nearby.
I like to win but not really pleased with how we did it today.  It was hard to evaluate Niemann since we didn't play very well behind him.
Fishing here in PC hasn't been going as well for me. Me vs Redfish is not good. The charts have it as a bad matchup.
All the little things are starting to show up right now. I like where we are.
Long bus ride to play the Astros today. For the ride home our movie choice is Step Brothers, 1 of the most underrated flix of recent times.
Manny looked like Pedro Rosa with that headfirst slide into second today. He also had a great at bat in the first inning off Oswalt.
We had good at-bats today not just in the 7th when we scored six.
Props to the Brignac family's gumbo. They are cooking cajun for the ballclub's pregame meal  today.
Four home runs tonight but the thing I liked the most was Matt Joyce running hard to first on a ground ball back to the pitcher.
I just told our writers that in the spring gms I would rather lose and play crisp like last nite than win and play sloppy. We were sharp.
Catching Yogi today when he fell today might have been my greatest play as a pro.
Ed Too Tall Jones joining us pregame on the field at Steinbrenner Field. Very cool.
Manny talked his way into the lineup again today. Told him I need him the next 2 days, but he still wanted in for the long trip to Jupiter.
Just getting ready to head to the field for the Marlins game. Price will start opening day. Shields will pitch the 2nd game.
@BostonSportsBoy. I will let you know Tuesday.
Didn't like the outcome today but loved our aggressiveness on the bases.
I encourage the growth of follicles on our club. I think guys should grow hair wherever they’re able. I’m not planning to cut mine in 2011.
Going to make decision on Opening Day starter on Tuesday
@GNPBruins. Felt like it.
Today was all about every man playing hard for nine innings. Great team win.
I am most concerned about how we interact as a group;  the off the field aspects. Coaches are doing a great job of working them on the field
@sluggers009 Get well soon Liam!
Omar Luna had a huge 1st day. He checked in with the other minor leaguers, took a physical, joined the varsity and had 2 hits incl a walkoff
Justine Siegal threw BP today and did well. She is here to raise awareness for women in b-ball and to honor Christina Taylor-Green's memory.
@ShockandAwe2980. Since he was pitching today he didn't participate
@ShockandAwe2980. Since he was pitching today he didn't participate.
We gave Raheem the game ball today.  I had him take Shields out of the game so he wouldn't get mad at me. They both handled it well.
Great day Bucs coaches are here Also good news on Hellickson who threw really well in BP. Brignac, Zorilla and E Johnson all feeling better.
Raheem Morris will be in our dugout today vs the Jays.
Bucs head coach Raheem Morris and some of his coaches will be coming to Port Charlotte tomorrow. One of them is going to suit up.
@sammy4938.
At today's game met the family of Younique Miller, a Pt Charlotte boy killed in Feb while riding his bike. Dad is a very strong, impressive.
Now is the time to try a few things so I am not concerned that we aren't winning. At the same time we have to play a tighter, better game.
@NeilDAmato. He hit a home run in yesterday's B game at Ft Myers
Manny wasn't going to make the trip to Ft Myers today but he came up to me yesterday and said he wanted to go so he is in leftfield today.
We picked up 1 pt for the tie w/ NY today.  I'm joking but in spring what about a hr derby to decide it like a shootout in hockey (kidding)
@SCHENK_STAR. I hope so. He can really help us.
We're going to hit BJ at leadoff today against the Yankees and tomorrow at Ft Myers. Jaso has a little soreness in his hip. Nothing serious.
It was a well-played game today at Dunedin but I never like to lose. When we have won in spring training we have gone to the postseason.
@pmariano49. Make sure it's fun for everyone including the coaches.
On the bus riding back from Sarasota want to send best wishes to Liam at Children's hospital in Seattle.
ESPN Bus was here before we left for Sarasota. Kruk and Kurkjian are a blast.
@sluggers009. What is his name?
@batgirl1954. That's a good idea I will look into it.
Eckstrom struggled today but everyone else pitched well. Manny's at-bats keep getting better and better.
Shoppach took C's out to dinner last week.  Like to foster an environment where guys spend time together but they have to do it themselves
Loved the energy today in the park today.  Great exchange between players and fans.
Watching Manny during BP this morning. Like what I am hearing from my coaches about how hard he is working. He will be in leftfield on Mon.
Had a great round of golf today with the folks from the St Pete Times and we raised more than 150 grand for charity. BJ's group won it.
Might see jaso, damon, longo and manny at the top of our order tomorrow against Pittsburgh.
We have a short day today with our charity golf tourney at 12. We will play a brief intrasquad game emphasis on baserunning, bunting and D.
@DavidFantin. Lot of line drives today.
During today's live BP session, BJ was hit in the ribs by an Adam Russell pitch. Thankfully he's OK. He's swinging the bat really well.
@sluggers009. I'm just not sure the items mailed to me here always get to me.
Price will start our spring opener on Saturday vs Pirates. Come on out.
Energy on all the fields today was really good. The fans had something to do with that.  I don't remember that many people here before.
Walking out to field now to talk to the full squad for first time.
@the10WSchamps. True
Really honored to meet the family of St Pete police officer Jeffrey Yaslowitz at FanFest.  My thoughts go out to Lorraine and her children
Enjoyed meeting every one of u at our thanksmas feast at Fan Fest. What a great day! Everyone was so patient and nice  Thank u all so much
Just found out my Thanksmas meal of spaghetti, meatballs, sausage at Fanfest tomorrow is sold out raising 10 grand for charity. Thanks all
There are still tickets left (not many) to sample my spaghetti and meatballs at Fan Fest on Saturday. Proceeds all go to charity.
@Persystent_Rob. Thanks for your support
I like what I am seeing in our guys faces. I like their look They are embracing the concept of doing the little things well.
I was eager to meet Chris Archer today. He met expectations.
Manny being here today early than expected makes a statement. I loved it. I like the buzz.
We start today with our mission: to Find Another Way.
We're on the field in 2 hours!
@sp0891. Yes. 930 am
Just getting ready to start our coaches meeting. Its great to see everyone here and ready to go for tomorrow.
@FRFirefighter. Thanks very much
@CHGIFlorida. Thank you.
@cindigy thank you.
@BobbyGraus. See you soon
@sports_ministry. You will need to go thru the Rays PR office for that. They keep me on a tight schedule
Spent the day in Port Charlotte getting ready. Meeting with coaches on Tues and start up with pitchers and catchers on Wed. I am so ready.
@sfintampa. Coming soon.
@Pujo123. Won't be anytime real soon Heading for Port Charlotte tomorrow.
@DownGoesAvery. I am in California for a good bit of the offseason but follow the Lightning from afar
Make that Boucher sorry for the typo.
Had the chance to sit down today with the Bucs' Raheem Morris and Lightning's Guy Bouchet. Very impressive guys. Great conversation.
Thanks for the birthday wishes gang. Taking in the Lightning game tonight.
@FrankDeSantis. Don't ever bet against Sosh. They always play the game right no matter who is on their roster.
@J_Vito. Possibly. Good thought.
@clayandstay. Good idea we will definitely consider that one.
I totally dig @RaysRepublic ... all kinds of good insider Rays nuggets. Keep it up and thanks for the Thanksmas plug!
@MarchettiT.  They're learning.
@AdamG_6. My sauce.
We'll be serving my spaghetti and sausage/meatballs and pierogies  at Feb 19 FanFest to benefit homeless/ Rays Baseball Foundation. Enjoy!
@reneeg1147. Fourteen can't wait.
@JetsFan4Life78. No Marlins, Brewers and Astros
Looking for some suggestions for themed road trips for 2011  I'm sure there are manny ideas out there.
Great first impression with our new guys. Had dinner with Manny last nite. He will be fun, but wants to compete starting at 7 every night.
@rooker72 sure send it in care of rick vaughn at tropicana field
Portion of the proceeds from FanFest will go to the familes of slain St Pete policemen Sgt Thomas Baitinger and K-9 Offcr jeffrey Yaslowitz
Merry Christmas to all...only 55 days until pitchers and catchers report!
On call ups Andrew coaches & I start talking about what we need about 2 to 3 wks in advanc always want 2 know what minor league guys think 2
most recent whine was my getting on Trop roof, have since apologized to said roof and r now on much better terms, maybe best ever...
Big surprise is up & dn offense R signs we r getting going at the right time keep pushing keep grinding I believe r guys r good in ths area
Jeremy has done what we thought, his ability 2 compete,poise ability 2 handle  MLscene his success a huge bonus process1st results 2 follow
Link to winery...this stuff is that good  http://www.springvalleyvineyard.com/
when u begin 2 play well as we r you must always apply pressure 2 the opponent we know what its like to b in world series,we want back in
Jaye's gift of a car was cool.My first car was $50 '52 chevy a when we took back seat out 2 clean there was a bucket of coal in there!
The road req time mgmt no set routine 2 depend on 2 carry day & venues where a team may play well w/a fan base that can help 2 inspire late
most impressive has been wrk ethic both mental & physical prep r players r maturing & r open 2 new thoughts & ideas great watching process
I've been asked 2 let u know 2 check the new Rays Republic Twitter. You'll get some pretty cool Rays Info. Follow Twitter.com/RaysRepublic
During spring training, we try to get our starters stretched out to 7 innings and the relievers make 7 to 10 appearances.
most recently was re-introduced to Sea Smoke....a Pinot Noir from santa barbara...stupid good
I am most excited about our attitude...our work has been focused and detailed....We did not like the long off season.
Our philosophy: Rays F.A.C.T.O.R: Flexibility / Accountability / Consistency / Trust / Organization / Respect..
It's always great to see everyone again..the baseball humor begins to fly..clubhouse humor can be ruthless & very funny
Thinking about recaping last yr & talk about the areas have 2do better focus on getting better start if we do rest of season will b positive
R expectations for 20-O-10 is return 2 playoffs & get bk 2 world series a mind once stretched has a difficult time going bk 2 its orig form
At Thanksmas we'll help folks in r area r brothers & sisters living in shelters or less need 2 b helped. Taking food out  out Mon-Thu
R guys r monitored by med staff off season.They r helped w/ workouts. Coaches & I help with items need 2 address swing pitching fielding etc
WS as I expected Phils r NL's most AL tm. Not suprised by pitching on both sides. Yank starters need 2 keep going link 2 #42 not as steady
2010 winning begins w/planning andrew coaches players.We'll wk 2 improve areas we came up short & try 2 make r gd pts beter 2010 starts now
Off season we'll take a break 4 a month or 2 B4 getting back after it. Winning in 2010 begins this winter. I stay in touch w/phone & emails
Looking for us 2 continue how we have more recently played.Getting back home has revived us a bit @ I'm seeing a fresher look w/the guys
Kaz was great I assured him he is going from a first class organization to another  From ownership on down the Angels are among the best
On Kaz, felt we have depth 2 cover trade presently & new guys can b part of r future This wont hurt chances of getting back 2 playoffs in 09
On the road Ive asked guys 2 think about doing better by talking about playing better Has 2 begin w/ mental effort b4 it shows up physically
Rangers r much better on pitching and defense as a team.. They r playing with new found enthusiasm... They r for real
During his AB's, BJ is getting started sooner in his movements which is permitting him to be on time...heads up, he can get real hot!
Want 2 stir boys up, With hair know blonde/bleach done many times Chose black 4 ring of fire roadtrip When in doubt askwhat would JCash do?
Instead of thinking of Texas, We have 2 focus daily & win tonight's game No team can b taken lightly. Must apply the same weight 2 ea game
If I was a DJ I would play whatever mood Im in from classical 2 Allman Brothers Stones, Motown 2 Springsteen, I consider all classic music!
I've been asked what position player would be the best pitcher, easy answer, BJ, i'm sure he would be 90+ mph.
Our new guys Zaun and springs bring many years of experience with much left in the tank. Can help us down the stretch Good additions for us
When losing, my main method is 2 remain positive I'll speak w/ more players 1 on 1 particularly those who I think need a confidence boost
No 1 likes 2 lose 4 games in a row but think about Red Sox series prior 2 road trp.Hav 2 avoid emotional coaster & keep a day 2 day mindset
Looking fwd 2 Anaheim trip 4 many reasons. Bought a home in long beach Ive not seen except 4 photos .Jaye is excited, & that matters most
West coast trip does interfere with routine, I always thought it was worse going west to east  Losing the hours is tougher than gaining them
The M's r aggressive & having fun Good young starters like 2 night I know Wak & his staff r always prepared & will not b outworked
Regarding mound visits:Some r 4 stategy some 4 getting a pitchers head right some need 2 b joked w/ others need something a bit more direct
To correct something it takes video to be helpful.In game adj can be made thru observ if u know where 2 look & have a knack 2 "see" it
Twitter followers have lots of ?'s about the #Rays, 2 long for Q&A in one tweet. ? = Do I notice mechanics that need improvement answer next
If I do change I tell them why & make suggestions Moving up require less expl those moving dn more However,they usually know the reasons why
Chng the lineup I consider what's best 4 tm & plyr I dont like 2 jump around. Hitters like same structure of who's in front & back daily
Boston is good and loaded with veteran players who know how to win They will be in this til the end.
Many items invvolved in trades.. Need, chemistry & culture. It matters to sustain success & as budgets permit 4 trades 2 occur
Steroids.I believe there's a strong pgm in place now thats working. Place asterix on the period & move on make sure it never happens again
On off days I may catch other games, I watch dvr'd shows Office Dirty Jobs & Larry Davids HBO special, I can't get enuf of his humor
Xpect both Aki & Fernando bk not sure when  Aki took ground balls & hit yesterday looked strong Fernando hit w/out restrictions looked good
Kaz had great tempo in his delivery Saw his confidence grow as game was in progress. Believe he can start doing that on a consistent basis
Yankees present problems offensively many good hitters 1 thru 9 R like us they c a lot of pitches. We have 2 make plays we r supposed 2.
We must focus on each game & win todays game Tomorrow will show up & then we place r concern there Really the best way 2 achieve success
Home games r more comfortable Sleep in ur own bed Easier routine Familiar faces home crowd, Playing surface backgrounds 4 hitter and pitcher
Has been a tough trip... Any time you do 3 cities it can wear you down.. Although, 3 great cities with a lot of energy
Yesterdays game was intense but U get so mentally busy during game theres no time 2 get nervous but there r times heart beats a bit faster
Toronto has many facets & 1 of the more interesting cities we visit Euro feel   Yorkville sec w/shopping & good restaurants 2 thumbs up!
Trade rumors can impact a guy Some have more ability than others 2 block it out Doc's outing shows it does not appear to b impacting him.
It's important following any loss to b the same guy who walks in2 the clubhouse the next day. R guys need to see consistent behavior from me
Been on bad end of a nohitter v Twins. its only 1 loss but if memory served me we won the day fol no hitter v Twins We play daily Move on
If I couldve I wouldve liked 2 managed Negro league stars 2 compare talent levels 2 who played in MLB @ same time would've been interesting
Tonight's pitcher for the White Sox has actually pitched vs our AAA, The Durham Bulls, team 3 times this year so we have some info on him.
Before facing a left handed pitcher, I like it when our right handed hitters work on hitting the ball more to the opposite field.
Kaz is fine and I expect him to pitch on his day. BTW, In Chicago U can get a great meal any block. Personally I like the Billy Goat Tavern
White Sox are a veteran team with good pitching. They like home runs so to beat them you want to keep the ball in the park.
JP is not the closer but actually it has worked out that way but there still may be situations he can pitch earlier and someone else close
CWS r throwing 3 lefties I may use all r guys vs diff pitchers & give some a day off, It creates opp 4 creativity, I like every 1 involved
I love hearing r players r cooperative & considered role models I may be biased but I believe we have a great group of people in r clubhouse
Twitter fans have ?'s comments, tough to answer in 140 spaces.  Next up a comment to fellow tweeter SEAL_Space about players as role models.
When Don Sutton was aquired by the Angels my number went from 20 to 70 I vowed 2 keep it no one would want 70 .
Twitter fans have asked me questions, no room in 140 space for both Q & A. next tweet why my # is 70
Need at least 5 & 5 trip Above is what we r looking 4 approach each day w/the thought win today's game worry about tomorrow when it shows up
Final thoughts on ASG it was great to see all the Rays and CC named MVP...Am very happy for CC... Really can propel him into second half
Pres Obama liked my glasses very stylish Congratulated me on being  manager of the yr & I him on his successes Easy to talk to regular guy
Spoke to Wake & told him I was holding him back 4 xtra innings Hes perfect 4 that role Also held back pena cruz & figgins 4 pinch hitting.
Best part ASG: Getting to know the players all were respectful & eager to play. Loved getting 2 address the group great talent in one room!
Spoke 2 players re slowing things down u dont want 2 leave & be upset with ur self 4 not taking time 2 enjoy Spoke 2 each, amazing group!
Challenging part of managing 2 nite is the game I want to involve all & know I may have to plan 4 extra innings & doing this with NL rules.
Believe me, this whole All Star Game experience is wow...take the World Series and condense it into 2 days...stuff going on everywhere
I'm currently into Spanish wines right now something called Mira (Salinas) so good you can taste the dirt the grapes grew in.
Twitter fans have asked questions, Which I"ll answer in the next "Tweet" I have had a number of questions about wines. Next tweet my answer
I don't feel the Home Run Derby hurts a player's swing. It is only one day and many players take BP in the same manner.
I felt Los deserved to be an all star based on leading the league in homers, and he ranks highly in  other offensive categories
On the break want our players 2 relax & enjoy their families when their minds drift 2 work,want r focus on winning division not wild card
Start day with a cup of Zen grn T followed by looking up other pitcher bike ride, KB exercise,2 park & Zim gives me Coney Isl' dog the best
Twitter fans have had questions tough 2 answer & explain the question in 140 spaces.Next tweet answers ?'s about game day routine.
Among all the concert series games probably looking most forward to the Beach Boys... Have spent a lot of time in So Cal....Fun music
The A's have a lot of good young pitching especially left handed. I believe Adam Kennedy's presence has helped them.
Success v Halladay is mostly the result of pitching well U only beat him via pitching-The scoring will be less as w/all teams he faces
Not into typical rhetoric when it comes 2 meetings & keep them minimal throw thoughts out & incl time 4 response Tue was normal pre AS talk
Getting Los on AS team would b great thought about all Rays infield but w/ Longo starting & JB Zo & Los off the bench it's almost impossible
New pitcher tonight making his debut requires more digging more phone calls, not as much video info we should have adequate written/verbal
Need to break with a positive week.We r hunting the top teams this year.I want us to dwell on winning division not looking to the wild card
We have not adjusted well from day off and it's been on the toasty side. Win 2night it's a .500 trip not bad should be better winning 1sr 2
ASG prep has been a bit of a distraction more for me than the team..Process takes me out of my  daily routine..just more to think about
David will take this seemingly negative situation & turn it positive, needs to be himself & believe in his high end abilities He'll be fine
David will take this seemingly negative situation & turn it positive, needs to be himself & believe in his high end abilities He'ill be fine
As always..looking for good energy tonight. Our guys r very good coming back ready to play the day after a loss..
Don't feel pressure to choose our players. Believe our guys have presented themselves well. The Rays will be adequately represented
For the All Star team have to be 100 % set by afternoon I had to call teams to get some opinions with close situations
More than anything I want us to continue to play with our positive risk taking ways, yet cut down on mental mistakes
The Rangers are playing with a lot of energy. Saw the last couple innings vs angels on tube when we got in.They hit well in their park
Got a chance to speak with the people at MLB and they cleared up some items and helped me narrow my thoughts for final All Star Selections.
I spoke to several players last night concerning game situations.We are still developing on a major league level. Working on All Star Roster
Tomorrow I will be doing some prep for the All Star Game.  im also hoping to get a ride in. pretty isolated in Arlington
Romero pitched a good game today, he made it tough for us to get key hits and they made some nice plays.
My biggest suprise has been the offensive output.We have exceeded expectations.100/100 SB/HR did not see that happening so quickly,very nice
I gave Zorilla the day off yesterday because I thought he was expanding his strike zone a bit and thought that may come from fatigue.
