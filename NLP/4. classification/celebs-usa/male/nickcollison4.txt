@JGibsTweetSpot but if owners overpaid 4their teams should we have 2bail them out after decades of not sharing in exploding appreciation?
@JGibsTweetSpot thats not the argument. The argument is we shouldnt pay for financing of the team if we dont share in the appreciation.
@alanhahn @JonesOnTheNBA i agree.That message has been pushed to players for 2 years. I think the players for the most part are on same page

Is the owners stance that a long, momentum crushing lockout is the best way to break the union, and guarantee themselves profit win or lose.
If Kobe,Farmar,&Dooling make money overseas it will not divide the union as Sterns tactic suggests. What unifies the NBAPA.......
Please dont get caught up in players going overseas as being the story of this lockout.Guys will make some money as opposed to sitting home.

@M_Toney is it fair then to count loan interest to buy teams as operating costs which they do and cuts loss claim in half?
My point is these very smart businessmen would not continue to invest is a failing system paying record numbers team after team
Also is the appreciation of the franchises when sold (warriors, suns, sonics etc) factored into the 400 million loss claim??...no
