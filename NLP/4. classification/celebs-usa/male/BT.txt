OMG @emilylazarlodge WE ARE SO INCREDIBLY PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!!!! Massive congratulations. I can‚Äôt think some something more overdue.
I LOVE the cover!!! Can‚Äôt wait for you guys to hear this. https://t.co/RjjD1TiNXp

I love this idea. Dream of mine is a multi-OS computer that you can cold boot into a single program (bypass the OS) so all the power of the machine is not bogged down by other apps or machine process. Kind of like an Avid but portable. I love this idea. https://t.co/RhjiFVMpaK
@Arcadiadiv @Alienware
Thanks so much Diana! Seeing people‚Äôs reaction to this today was very moving. Lots of really beautiful feedback. When we perform live this summer, maybe we‚Äôll randomly do a song or two like this. https://t.co/F7FUlLKqMi
More where that came from!! https://t.co/Wc56euUImM
Thanks so much. I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs not a great song unless you can strip it down to piano (or guitar) and voice. I agree :) https://t.co/mh2TkTTxwn
@AzorFrank Thanks so much Frank and these computers are absolutely stunning. The @intel folks helped upgrade these with Optanes and it‚Äôs absolutely to die for. Thanks again!
Btw not bashing @Spotify I think they‚Äôve started to turn a corner to a more favorable model for artists. Like what they‚Äôre up to!

Thanks again LA. It was a blast. Little #LAkitchenrig I‚Äôll miss you. Pumped to hit the studio tomorrow. Bye bud! https://t.co/eItpMzKnl9
Also @Spotify it‚Äôs a strategy. The people that use my name aren‚Äôt just trolling, they get a LOT of traction on some of their songs because they appear at the top of my feed. This should be blocked and these accounts should be shut. It‚Äôs disingenuous.
Yes it‚Äôs INCREDIBLE. Go vegan peppermint unsweetened marshmallows and coconut almond milk and you‚Äôre done. Crazy good. https://t.co/JinNqEONXT
Ik ik. Hey @Spotify how does this keep happening? I have a trademark on ‚ÄúBT‚Äù I‚Äôm a verified account. Uh and this is obviously not me. It‚Äôs a ton of work for us. My wife fixes 1-2 of these a week. https://t.co/6CtvLNjfKB
@misterfielding If you‚Äôve got a record player, it‚Äôs all about the vinyl! If not I‚Äôd say CD.

Hi guys! Anyone here using @paulvirostek Soundminer with Logic Audio and Cubase? If yes tell me why I want it! Looks cool for sure. Would love to hear your experience.
Thanks for the fantastic time today. Especially to Doug and A3E, Andrei and the @intel crew and Brian @PCAudioLabs https://t.co/ucUIMQfKkK
So here‚Äôs my top 4 #namm2019 so far. The @WaldorfGmbH Quantum. You‚Äôre dead, best synth in years. You‚Äôre welcome. The @GamechangerA Plasma distortion and spectral freeze pedal (RUN to this booth if at NAMM) @Expressive_E Touche (AMAZING) and Black Corporation Synthex clone.
Fantastic @SpitfireAudio dinner went until all hours last night. Some super exciting projects with those boys this year! Great to see you @AlanMeyerson @JoeComposer and @MorrisTrevor super enjoyed our time together. See some of you guys at NAMM today!
Okay guys, my first SUPER legit discovery at @NAMMShow #NAMM2019 the @StudioBlackCorp Synthex clone. We used 3x Elka Synthex on the All Hail @thesilence album. It‚Äôs one of my fav synths ever. This clone is LE-GIT. Can‚Äôt wait to get this synth.

@aortaproject I‚Äôm not a sample pack kinda guy
NAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMM
That kick drum (wow love this question) took me 6 hours to patch on the System 100. The coolest part is I used the actual gate signal (clipped on the console) for the clicky transient. I sampled it in the MP-60 https://t.co/VkixZKMFOX
@Mark_Reeder @thesilence The CD is 16/44.1 the best listen by a bajillion percent for the AHTS album is vinyl. It‚Äôs its intended listening format.
Thanks for listening Evan! https://t.co/miWrIHeBld
Who‚Äôs coming! SO excited for NAMM!!! https://t.co/Rb12LTYaCA
@Protector_99 No and I wouldn‚Äôt do that. There are things like vinyl noise (glitch and microrhythmic figures) that are time corrected to 2048th notes. Putting it on vinyl wouldn‚Äôt make it better it‚Äôs make it less accurate. For something like AHTS it‚Äôs a total win. Sounds warm and 80‚Äôs

There has to be a balance between the head and the heart. Especially in music. Happy First Wednesday of 2019 :)
Have an emotional meaning and subtext that transcends any pretense we carry. The simpler, the better. A lullaby. The day music no longer moves me, I won‚Äôt be breathing.
This is not to say all of these academic persists, looking for new timbers, sounds and harmonic structures that convince, change and shatter is not a noble persuit. It is. My point is, harmony and structure and all the cliches we‚Äôve developed...
And so all our pedantic line cliches, simple turns of phrase, I, Vi, IV, V‚Äùs etc etc when delivered authentically, reach inside our emotional core with remarkable, laser guided like accuracy.
Which is probably statistically true but there is more to it than that. The musical language we‚Äôve developed over the last several thousand years is one with the profound ability to convey feeling states that are complex and hard to articulate.
For those not following the academic music community and their developments, since serialism, there‚Äôs a systemic belief that we explored all possible permutations of harmony and melody by about 1950.
I‚Äôve been reading a new book by Curtis Roads that‚Äôs been blowing my mind. It‚Äôs the yang to this Kacey records ying.
The @KaceyMusgraves record is literally the ‚ÄúThriller‚Äù of country music. I‚Äôve not heard a more beautiful, well engineered, better song, stunning musicianship in years. A profound accomplishment.
Thanks for the 3&gt; Happy New Year! So glad you guys are enjoying this so much. It‚Äôs my favorite score I‚Äôve done to date. https://t.co/MXC1IXzINF

Anyone built a Logic X script for translating midi CC to SysEx? I want to control the filter, res and filt env from mix position on a couple vintage synths. I know it can be done ‚Äúfader learning‚Äù in environment but since I‚Äôm using External Instrument AU much easier with a script.

@JBass43357453 Emailed you
@dillonbastan1 Hey! Thanks for your tweet. Follow me and pm coming :)
@dave_elton Amazing!
@SteveHelstrip Absolutely but not on live input capture.
Super appreciate that. I think that‚Äôd be the be-all-end-all looper. Somehow would need to run in DAW‚Äôs other that Love though too. https://t.co/Vi2YoFFneb
Oh forgot something super important. When you release a loop it needs to fade out over X duration. I can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs not a looper that does this. If there is I can‚Äôt find it.
11. Spectral Freeze (so think Paul Stretch/Soundhack FFT spectral smear phase vocode type sound) That‚Äôs the list. I‚Äôll make a full album with this one plugin. If it already exists, let me know! (There‚Äôs no - everything but this one thing. Need all this stuff!)
5. Tape noise/wow and flutter emulation (amount) 6. High pass filter 7. Low pass filter 8. Pitch offset (up or down 2x octaves) sample rate only so effects duration. 9. Loop course jitter (16th notes, think Amen break) 10. Loop fine jitter (playhead scrubbing)
Even better if any of you guys are MAX/MSP wizards would love to knock something up together. Would be great to have the following per-loop. 1. Crosfade amount (should go down to off-axis click). 2. Buffer start 3. Buffer end 4. Say 4x effect sends per-loop.
Happy Sunday all! Do any of my smart twitter followers know of a simple isorhythmic looper? Want something that holds 4x loops. Hardware or software. Work to clock but can have say 5/4 against 7/8 against 4/4. Loops must have their own output.

@pixlr__ @Lazz_R @NickChicane @ADE_NL Absolutely! I have in past already. Simply he did a beautiful mix of Flaming June I never heard until recently and the intro to my version on Electronic Opus is nearly identical. I‚Äôve played it on piano like that live since AI wrote it.
@Lazz_R @pixlr__ @NickChicane @ADE_NL Seriously? Feel really bad for him honestly. Never seen someone with more influence treat so many people with so little kindness. In comparison he‚Äôs actually been nice to me. It‚Äôs total bs.

This really changed that for me pretty radically. She is humble and likable, gifted and measured. Her acting performance is as wonderful as her singing (really saying something) and Bradley Cooper is incredible. This is an absolute must see film. Absolutely loved every second.
I‚Äôm a huge Bradley Cooper fan. Loved most all of his films. Never though twice about Gaga honestly. She‚Äôs obviously incredibly talented singer but the songs and image have always seemed like a modern approximation of the 80-90‚Äôs Madonna shock and awe. Just kinda not ‚Äúmy tribe‚Äù.
It‚Äôs a great reminder that audiences still crave an authentic musical experience, commentary to the human condition and can live without Oreos and 2 minute songs (couldn‚Äôt resist). It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic.
Okay so got that out of the way. So thread hijack and great news. We watched A Star is Born last night and literally wept for 2 and a half hours. This movie is wonderful. Spoiler, it‚Äôs going to win everything.
Why not do this with music? I‚Äôll let you come to your own ideas about this. Of course music is one of the most profound cross cultural catalyst for communicating the human condition and experience. Call me a luddite and an optimist.
Oreos are a great example I‚Äôve previously mentioned. They‚Äôre designed to be addictive like drugs. The fat/salt/sugar balance perfectly stimulates the pleasure center of the brain. Many fast foods are the same and worse.
We are in the process of ‚Äúoptimizing‚Äù (boy it‚Äôs hard to write that even in quotes) music like we are ‚Äúoptimizing food.
You oversimplify to the point of kindergarten. Start a song on the down beat of a chorus! Of course!! Everyone is going to fast forward anyway. Outro? No way! People are going to jump to the next track on their playlist. Make it 2 minutes long!
I‚Äôm not being chased by any  dinosaurs (don‚Äôt know about you guys) so I prefer my pre-frontal cortex not my reptile brain but I digress. This is the world we‚Äôve made. Overstimulated, saturated w/choice, lightening fast turnover rate so how do you get media through in that system?
Streaming has sent music into a creative and existential tailspin where (real marketing term) ‚Äúsnackable‚Äù media for a culture overstimulated and constantly subjugated to social stimulation that keeps us in ‚Äúlimbic resonance‚Äù is just what‚Äôs happening to get used to it.
This article makes me want to jump off something. Firstly it‚Äôs written very well and very accurate (so no offense intended to the author at all). Some of the most depressing highlights are things like 13 song albums with 104 writers. Real life.
I‚Äôve got good news and I‚Äôve got bad news. Let‚Äôs start by getting the bad news out of the way. Anyone (fan or musician) who wants to understand why music has changed and is continuing to change. Read this. https://t.co/L0g3n8YKuu

So this is a salute to you my fellow artists, dreamers, thinkers and doers. Your courage inspires me. I acknowledge and validate your courage and your struggle. Profoundly. I too love it. The world is a better place because of this courage.
An innate gift and often a variety of types of trauma. What courage artists have!
Additionally as an adjunct thought, it makes a lot sense why so many artists suffer from a pleathora of mental health conditions. Add to that that many with a proclivity for the arts arrive there often by...
The palpable irony that artists are like a living, walking, raw nerve is not lost on me! It‚Äôs an extraordinary person that keeps themselves open to sense and subtext, emotion and feeling: the weight of the human condition and receives criticism and rejection as a frequent reward!
A life in the arts means a life of criticism and rejection. In fact, the more profound your work or discoveries, the less people will embrace them in their moment of creation. It‚Äôs not until the are  commodified they make sense to many.
When I was in Nashville, I met with someone who was famous for NOT signing Taylor Swift! That‚Äôs a weird thing to be famous for but I digress.
That‚Äôs a pretty profound realization. Rejection breaks many people. There are some wonderful books about pioneers (not just artists) and how many people snubbed their work. Often right before a massive breakthrough.
Being a (we‚Äôll call it) working artist means you are a seasoned professional at being rejected. One of the only common thru-lines of artists (successful or otherwise) is a life of rejection. You have to be better at accepting rejection than making art!
Having a wonderful conversation with my wife this morning about the path of a working/functioning/actualized artist. We realized some pretty profound things that warrant sharing.
@josephjo it‚Äôs not me. It‚Äôs an error on Spotify‚Äôs part.
You guys got a fav ID3 tagging software for Mac? Share! Need to clean up some old MP3‚Äôs.
@buzzinlikeneon Comment was should you like it? Also noting this is not in the collective consciousness that this is possible much less happening. You do you though üòÇ.
Beautiful rainy Sunday. Enjoying so much not being on a flight somewhere. Happy Sunday.
One of my best studio days in years. Wow beast mode ENGAGED. It‚Äôs the weekend! Whoot! Taking tomorrow off. Have a great safe Friday night y‚Äôall!

Show of hands, how many of you have had that look of terror when Instagram pulls up adds from a key word out of a private conversation you were having with your phone in your pocket. Has happened to me 7 times (yes I‚Äôve counted)
@BTfan4life @GANEMYDE Lance I love this image. Where is that from?
Just spent a good 40 min watching this absolute MONSTER player on YouTube. @Cory_Henry you‚Äôve quite literally blown my mind. Would love to have you play on a track or connect on some music. You all have to hear this guy. Just wow.

Alright studio, it‚Äôs your turn. Let‚Äôs do this. I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm cheating on the studio with Xcode.
Think you guys will SUPER enjoy these sounds. See what I did there? https://t.co/JjzhXcRuZk sounds? https://t.co/Z4Sj7jmnaz
@chrisgeary Yes done plenty in the analog domain. Did it the same way, record and bounce to stereo. Rinse repeat. Somewhere there‚Äôs some 499‚Äôs holding hundreds of tracks on a single 24 track from when I was a teenager.
@brightlightx2 Me and the misses have been bumping your tunes at breakfast. Really like what you‚Äôre doing and your voice is fantastic.
@pokadottricks It‚Äôs pretty equally balanced honestly. I write in sections so each section may happen only once or twice and will be comprised of approx 80-100 tracks (after folding down)
@terrydunlin Sounds lovely. Great idea actually. On it.
384 tracks down to 32 stems. This is BIG progress. Tomorrow this ones in the bag. üî•
@brightlightx2 Thanks again man. Look forward to checking out your music. You‚Äôll be me tomorrow morning Spotify listen!
It‚Äôs crazy how deep in the stem wormhole I am right now. Like CRAY-Z.
@pokadottricks They‚Äôre packed. Not sure I understand the question.
@brightlightx2 Thanks for the kind words. That‚Äôs all done by hand. Lots done in vintage (now) samplers.
And this new album track weighing in at 384 tracks. It‚Äôs stem day. Yes it tis‚Äô! #HappyMonday

@MrJoeRMusic @TranceEmerson I don‚Äôt agree. It‚Äôs absolutely a choice. The one that kills me is when people say it‚Äôs more expensive. It‚Äôs WAY less expensive to meal prep but involves a lot of time and effort. There‚Äôs a million reasons you and anyone else can do this. It‚Äôs a choice, and I respect yours.

@BrianRose1987 Meat, vegetables, fruits in moderation and nuts. And piles of water.
@iamthejw1 It will actually change your life. Can‚Äôt be overstated. Push through first 10 days. Most people quit then. You can thank me in 30....or 300!
To many studies linking sugar to depression to even tweet about. If there‚Äôs 2x people cut out is sugar and gluten. https://t.co/Bzhe7ASeCv
@Chicaned_UK I‚Äôm not saying eating can‚Äôt be pleasurable. It absolutely can be (hopefully is!), it‚Äôs just not it‚Äôs purpose. It‚Äôs purpose is to nourish your body and brain.
The worst/best part about Whole 30/Paleo is this : if you do it, any time you eat something bad for your body and brain you‚Äôll know what it feels like if you‚Äôre not doing that. It basically can‚Äôt be ‚Äúunseen‚Äù. Happy Monday to you all :)
If anyone reading this stops eating the following for a month and doesn‚Äôt feel like a new person, I‚Äôll eat my shoes. Added sugar, alcohol, gluten, grains, any processed food, dairy, soy (estrogen booster in men), legumes. Try it. I swear to God it‚Äôll change your life.
The craziest part is YOU HAVE A CHOICE. So if you‚Äôre walking around feeling sad, overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, unmotivated, lost, confused pick up some spinach and farm raised beef or have some free range salmon and cauliflower rice.
Further there‚Äôs mountains of empirical scientific research linking food to mental illness, mood disorders and a million other things that aren‚Äôt heart disease and the ones you commonly think of.
And you are ingesting the world through your mouth (weird but true thought). You are actually assimilating the world through your mouth. Do you want to be polluting your body and brain with things toyed with in a laboratory?
Food is not for pleasure. All these engineered foods where they play around with salt to fat to sugar relationships to make them actually addictive (like Oreos) are poison. We are actually poisoning ourselves daily.
I‚Äôve not really mentioned it but we never stopped Whole 30. I‚Äôve never felt better in my entire life, like ever. It‚Äôs really changed the way I feel about food and about self control.
Thanks for all the timeblock info guys. Super helpful stuff. Anything else you‚Äôve got to share I‚Äôm listening.
Anyone here do timeblocking? If you‚Äôre an expert I‚Äôm interested. Would love to hear what works for those of you that do this. Happy Friday!

@Evan_Arnett @MykoVu It won‚Äôt prevent it, there just will not be the need for it so the study of it will cease. Look at the upside, imagine the new forms of music and art we‚Äôve yet to imagine that neural networks will make not for our pleasure, but for theIr own.
@cahorton I‚Äôm working on something that led me to this timeframe.
Art, music and literature will all be coterminous. Multidisciplinary arts like film and VR media will be secondary. https://t.co/2nukGdSdT6
@mccrory Kinda and kinda not. I can‚Äôt think about 30,000 variables and do a comparative real time analysis can any of us? 100 minds to make a film? Amazon S3 could do it with the right algorithms in seconds.
@barreraluisfe Who‚Äôs complaining? I‚Äôm making a footnote. I‚Äôm both excited and frightened as we should probably all should be. In our lifetime we will witness the birth of what could easily be argued is a new species.
@freddysheinfeld Provoking a deeply meaningful and emotional response, date I say transcendent or religious can be quantified, studied and recreated.
@freddysheinfeld And the amount of biometric information we are already collecting is astonishing. Your pulse? How fast you walk? How active you are...data. Your phone or Apple Watch collect them. Retinal tracking on web sites studying what you look at and for how long. Data.
@freddysheinfeld Sadly incorrect. Our preferences (both personal &amp; as societal groups) can also be quantified easily to a very large ‚Äúbig data‚Äù set. The connection you are taking about is just a complex set of information based on where you grew up, your life experience, your likes and dislikes
@MykoVu Sort of. I‚Äôm saying we are in the last generations of creators right now.
@iBluestone Distilling trance to an algorithm is actually frighteningly easy. Google Magenta starred with Bach. Have you heard it? Your jaw will drop.
@Metamorphisnt Like they have something to say for the model for monetization of music shifting from 85cents net a song to .00038 cents a stream? What I just wrote is already in progress under everyone‚Äôs nose.
@iamthejw1 Humans will be curators not creators. We are nearly there actually this isn‚Äôt a big leap.
And every artistic work ever created will be quantified in a way a humans mind can‚Äôt think (ie multidimensional data sets) and turned into algorithms that can be, curated, breed and grown. The next generation of famous artists will be algorithms.
Inside 10 to 15 years, artificial intelligence will be able to do anything creative a human being can do, in many cases, significantly better. They won‚Äôt have to sleep either and will be able to create with Quantum computing near the speed of light.

@jcbenitez19 It will promise. Coming soon.
@soundanswer Erik thanks so much for your reply. I‚Äôve got a stable OS9 rig. This is a OSX rig with at least Protools 7 and Logic 7 to load some This Binary Universe sessions. Thanks so much for the thoughtful response though.
I love this idea actually (will leave you with this) similar idea to negative space in art....it‚Äôs often more powerful and/or fruitful to define yourself, relationally, your work etc by what you aren‚Äôt. Shines a very different light üí°
Anyway, I‚Äôm pretty sure @avid should pay therapy costs for life lol. It‚Äôs amazing sometimes what is possible ‚Äúin-spite of‚Äù not because of.
I finished Emotional Technology on it, This Binary Universe, my Stealth and Monster Scores and countless TV/remixes etc. I don‚Äôt know how, but walked through that fire for about 5 solid years.
And picked up the whole thing (like 150 lbs for real) and went to throw it off the balcony of my house rotfl. The guys that worked at my place at the time (Mike D love you looking at you) talked me out of it. That‚Äôs how much I loathed that system.
The DTDM/DAE/Core audio this was a distaster. True story : When I was writing This Binary Universe, one day (I made a note 144 crashes) I calmly took apart my HD rig, interfaces and computer (keep reading this is funny...)
From about 2005-2010 is the craziest period in computers and DAW‚Äôs there ever was. Apple and @Avid lied to people for about 5-7 straight years about Protools and Logic compatibility. I posed a challenge in Keyboard to anyone with a working system I‚Äôd buy it. Not one response lol.
I‚Äôm going to rebuild my This Binary Universe rig but hope it won‚Äôt crash (literally real life) every 10 minutes. It‚Äôs amazing how much music I‚Äôve made that for all intents Ana purposes, shouldn‚Äôt exist.
So I posed this question about 12+ years ago. No one has ever answered so I‚Äôll repeat myself lol. Anyone got a mid 2000 Logic TDM system that works? If yes please all the details, versions of Logic, Protools, OS and all hardware.
Those are fighting words for @lacyinwonderlnd one of her fav records ever. I appreciate the vote of confidence Dave üëçüèª I know we could make something really special.

The new @dcfc is phenomenal. Wonderful, thoughtfully recorded, great songs. Can‚Äôt wait to hear the whole album. I‚Äôve heard a rumor there is some Fairlight IIx on there. Excited to read interviews about that!
@MrDisco3 @SciTechMuseum Adore all Bob Moogs pioneering work. Especially the MiniMoog Model D and the MemoryMoog. Two of my favorites. I use them daily.
Getting my head down and making some beauty now in the studio. To some of my closest friends I‚Äôve been sub-tweeting today. Want you guys here in 20 years. Happy Monday to you all.
@davedresden With you Dave. Crazy thing is if you do have a 100 million Spotify plays you also have 5-10 reps (manager, attorney, agents, business manager) eating 50% off the top, then you have to pay expenses. Wait THEN you pay tax on the gross.
I‚Äôll end this by saying, (especially to my friends that are compulsively working and making other people wealthy). Stop, look what you‚Äôve accomplished, let that be enough. Spend some time with your families and friends. Get back to what you love, making music only to make music.
Business folks get rich, the artists do 20+ jobs, shorten their life spans with unreasonable expectations, travel, shows etc. If you look at any huge DJ or dance music artist to do all of what they‚Äôre doing, they‚Äôre destroying their hearing, not sleeping and wrecking their body.
This model is unsustainable. The saddest part is the wake up calls if there are any will be important artists dying.
To make dance music now you are 1. Artist 2. Producer 3. Engineer 4. Mastering engineer 5. Marketing and social media maven 6. Tour manager 7. At the very least an adjunct to press...I can keep going here.
Wait you‚Äôre also responsible to engage your social media to promote a show because now promoters don‚Äôt for the most part even do that.
Now something like that is actually unimaginable. Albums are all but non-existent. Turn over rate for a single is 1-2 weeks. Do you mix your own records? Of course you do. You probably master them too (insane!) and somehow you tour 120-200 nights a year?
I was the only artist I (personally) knew at that time that mixed their own records. Many people had both a ‚Äúproducer‚Äù and and ‚Äúengineer‚Äù. I performed both those roles for many artists through my entire career to date. My point being, that was more than one person.
When I first started making dance music, before there were idiom specific names (hence getting the moniker Trance named after my early works, supposedly from my last name) it was considered extraordinary to mix your own music. Like extraordinary.
Electronic music and now the business that has sprung up around it the last 10 years has set such extraordinarily unrealistic expectations on the people that make it.
I have some close friends (obviously no names will be mentioned) that I look at their tour schedules and can actually say I‚Äôm not just concerned about their health but about how long they will live.

And if that makes me a Luddite or common or regressive then so be it. The beauty of artist (imho) comes from the ‚Äútime put in‚Äù. Truly knowing your craft so you can fully express. Absolutely love it.
‚ÄúHey whatever happened to, Waitin' your turn Doing it all by hand, 'Cause when everything is handed to you It's all only worth as much as the time you put in In all just seems so good the way we had it Back before everything became, automatic‚Äù
Before that we listened to @mirandalambert ‚ÄúAutomatc‚Äù which has literally my life motto in the lyrics. If I was the tattooing type this would be somewhere on my body.
Listening to one of my all time favorite (modern) artists @zacbrownband ‚ÄúGoodbye in Her Eyes‚Äù. I mean if you write one song this good in your life, you did it in my opinion. Pure, humble, direct, authentic beauty. Moves me so hard I can‚Äôt express.

I‚Äôve got a solution that will surprise you. Absynth. 9 octave bendrange with Lag control to smooth controller messages. Unreal. Works a dream. Patch made. Thanks for the help guys and hope this helps someone else!
@JRokujuushi Thanks for the ideas. They‚Äôre all great. Pretty sure I‚Äôm going to have to make this. The irony of ironies is that something like Kurzweil V.A.S.T can easily do this (9 octaves super smooth) I just need something in the box.
@JRokujuushi Totally. Again this is a great idea. Need access to this on Mac (windows too) but primarily Mac.
@Jamie_Myerson It will stair-step/quantize/zipper noise. Needs to be super high resolution/smooth portmanteau over 6 octaves.
@MrCarefulGamer Oh this is literally my whole life needing things like this. It‚Äôs why I started a software company!
@HarbourEDM All those but Falcon have a 2-3 octave bend range. Most importantly I need it to smooth the bend curve so it doesn‚Äôt sound quantized. Other ideas?
@JRokujuushi This totally works yes. Even though about this as a solution. I need it as a VST or AU that can run in all my DAW‚Äôs
@Jamie_Myerson No 2 octave bend range
More looking for a 1. Does not exist 2. _______ instrument. If I need to make it, I can. Hoping it exists though.
Hey tweeples, okay looking for suggestions. I need a VST/AU that can 1. Make a sine wave 2. Bend said sine wave 6 octaves (not mono glide I need precise control of duration) must smoothly interpolates (like mono-glide) the bend info. Suggestions por favor!

@djtt88 Do you know why? Same reason people perceive buss compression as ‚Äúgood‚Äù it mimics what your ears do when they can‚Äôt take in any more amplitude. They sidechain to sub information because those waveforms are physically longer.
@SteveHelstrip You‚Äôre probably right. Saddens me a lot actually. The difference between a service like LNDR (which is great for rough score cues for example) and a human being like Emily Lazar with 30 years of study, artistry and life experience is like a squashed egg and a  Ferrari.
@djtt88 Love this perspective. I honestly think a lot of music from a technical perspective sounds terrible from the ninety‚Äôs. The converters, aliasing, I could go on and on. 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs all the hardware gave so much love to the sound. As we switched in the box the transition was ERK!
I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs a plugin idea in this thread. We need a way to utilize this ‚Äúbus compression‚Äù as a technique that is intermittent not omnipresent. Also across stems. Nothing can do this. A kind of polyphonic compression if you will.
@Scott_SKG Absolutely true. The point being a bunch of triadic, no voice leading, MOR, Sylenth parts over a Vengeance kick drum sounds like the skies parting. It‚Äôs not Rachmaninov know what I‚Äôm sayin?
@aortaproject @masterclass Yes I am thinking about doing something like this.
Certainly when I‚Äôm writing music for a film something like this would never fly. It‚Äôs all about subtly, shape, space and tremendous dynamics. Master bus compression forgives way too many wrongs. The Instagram filter of music! Would love to hear your thoughts.
But used the way it is, it‚Äôs completely removed any sense of dynamics from modern electronic music. Surely there‚Äôs a middle ground here. I‚Äôm thinking of making stems in all my DAW autoloads to utilize this as a technique not the end all be all.
Not that it‚Äôs a horrible thing either master buss compression, it‚Äôs just an observation. It has become the ‚Äúsound‚Äù of now. It‚Äôs I‚Äôd say about 50% of why modern electronic music sounds so ‚Äúbig‚Äù even with such simple parts. For what‚Äôs now called a ‚Äúdrop‚Äù it can be fantastic.
There are hundreds of well known electronic artists that if you mute their master bus compression, the record sounds like a poorly produced, pedantic demo.
Long interesting conversation with @lacyinwonderlnd on our airport drive this morning about master bus compression. It‚Äôs like an Instagram filter for music (her observation). It‚Äôs crazy how true that is.

‚Äúwho spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.‚Äù
who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions...
A new fav quote ‚ÄúIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood‚Äù
Hey @Izludetingel and @Arcadiadiv thank you both for talking to me tonight. I really appreciate both your candor and honesty. John I‚Äôm sorry Alex treated you the way he did. Mark, I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt get to see the show. I hope I can make it up to you both. Thanks for listening.
@Arcadiadiv great send me your number
@Arcadiadiv if there‚Äôs something I can help you with, great. If not, how can I help you move on? Either way feel free to DM me your number.
@Arcadiadiv I no longer work with Alex. Not sure why trying to drag me through the mud helps you get an apology from him.
@Arcadiadiv hey John. We‚Äôre trying to DM you. Is there something you didn‚Äôt get? Kindly DM your number so we can resolve it if there is something.
@Izludetingel I just posted the true story. Send a number. Happy to call, you‚Äôve got an opportunity to resolve this and you‚Äôre choosing to be angry. I wish I could fix that for you but I can‚Äôt.
@Izludetingel Wouldn‚Äôt it feel better to you to talk about this? I can‚Äôt fix what Tanz did. I‚Äôm happy to Skype but you‚Äôve denied this and I can‚Äôt make a party (was Tanz responsibility). Man, do you want to be mad or talk about it? Will call you right now just need a number.
@Izludetingel Can you kindly answer the question Mark? What do you not have?
@Izludetingel we are in contact with him over email and lacy is planning time with him.
@Izludetingel I‚Äôm asking YOU. What do you not have?
@jslydemusic And we haven‚Äôt been silent. The guy that started that thread was missing two signatures on a score. He sent it to us, we got them and sent it back. He‚Äôs just an angry guy it seems. We‚Äôve given him and everyone we can find what they‚Äôre promised.
@jslydemusic Hopefully you‚Äôll read my post. I‚Äôm so proud of that project and grateful to the people that contributed. We spent every penny on making the album and show (in fact it was matched by investors) we spent 2x the Kickstarter.

@kaskade @theversusverses Hey Ryan hope you‚Äôre well. I block people that are rude. The world needs more kindness so I support those that give it. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to say no.  I find it amazing that people can act in certain ways online and expect a pass when called out.

If I could make one life recommendation to everyone, it‚Äôd be don‚Äôt check your phone the first hour of your day and spend that time reading.  This morning I began a new book and in the first 5 lines was this line...
Excited to let you guys know a collaboration I did with @guiborattomusic is coming out soon on his new album, set to release June 15
I wholeheartedly agree. https://t.co/DqGFHsqp6e
Prayers for his friends and family. It really hit me how profoundly sad it is to loose someone just getting started. If you‚Äôre an artist you should read this. There is blood on these people‚Äôs hands. https://t.co/YtTOmeCvJV
I‚Äôll leave you with this. Unlike many others that have said something incredibly disingenuous about @Avicii I wasn‚Äôt a fan of his music but I did respect his contribution and think he was very talented and deserved better from the people around him that palpably failed him.
So, when you do find people that are altruistic, and get it (you the artist) and are willing to roll their sleeves up and get in the trenches with you. Man, celebrate that and tell people about these people so we can all exemplify and celebrate them. They are extremely rare.
It is VERY uncommon for attorneys, managers, agents, business managers, lawyers (I put them twice because they‚Äôre usually the most nefarious) to have any semblance of concern for an artists well being, emotionally, physically, spiritually, relationally or in any other capacity.
I‚Äôd like to think these days, I‚Äôve surrounded myself with them. I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones. The point of this lengthy diatribe is this : if you‚Äôre a young artist or have dreams of a life in the arts....know this.
There are the rare few people in the music business that treat artists and their expression with sincerity and reverence for the emotional and relational costs associated with producing valuable and meaningful artists works.
I once had a manager that said ‚ÄúIf I could just clone you 2x I could retire and let you do all the work‚Äù. He was 3 drinks in when he said this out loud but I knew it was how he felt from the beginning. Artists to most in business are a commodity.
Many (myself at times) are represented by people who are thinking 0% about artistic integrity and expression and 100% about how to (watch use of language here) manipulate an artist into a situation they can monetize.
In thinking about it, something I‚Äôve discussed privately with my friends and family for years is the people that surround artists. Many artistic people are actually very shy and or introverted.
I actually put Twitter back on my phone to share this and talk about it. Firstly really saddened by @Avicii passing. What a tragedy it is for a life to be cut so short.

@Franck_Alcidi And further, I‚Äôve been playing Flaming June intro like this since 1997 live, if anything, he copied me. And again, I wrote the song.
@Franck_Alcidi This just isn‚Äôt true and disparages the beautiful piece of music I wrote. These notes came out of my head in 1997. The end.

You will be able to hear it soon &amp; even sooner if you are in India.   I am scoring my first Bollywood film, it‚Äôs a thriller called Ittefaq!
It‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been writing some of the best music I‚Äôve ever written in my life.   And here‚Äôs something really cool about it

More amazing patch making 5Dtouch Phobos controlled by @we.are.roli Blocks. Insane the sounds I'm making with... https://t.co/gituDwUjoU
Which, was an unexpected gesture and I appreciated it. I hope he speaks with staff at @united and they follow through with staff traning
An update on yesterday‚Äôs @united fiasco. Head of customer service met me at our plane once landed at Dulles to talk about entire situation
@Sunda amazing as usual! It‚Äôs always our first stop when we get into Chicago.   The great white = favorite thing ever
In case you were wondering how it all panned out https://t.co/caMfNUCncs
You can‚Äôt run a business like that. That‚Äôs what happened to a business like TWA
I mean look at what @united did when they beat that doctors face in. They denied it for a full 24 hours. Made him the bad guy.
@tarunshama2105 @united I‚Äôm not sure if they can survive honestly. They‚Äôd have to do such an about face it‚Äôs unbelievable.
Just got a text from @united saying flight is departing at 3:00. Highly doubtful since it‚Äôs 2:59 and half the plane is empty. Good work guys
Did @delta status match you when you left @united ? https://t.co/hNiZ30mJwK
Seriously, like is Google Magenta the new AI for @united? I get it‚Äôs in its infancy. Maybe it‚Äôll get smarter. https://t.co/a8q3uyWgQQ
@rickyleepotts @united their DM response is basic, they‚Äôve said they are working on getting me on my way. Not even sure what that means
Yeah me too, why don‚Äôt @united tell all my fans and followers, if I‚Äôve got it wrong. Would love to hear from them too, publicly. https://t.co/t8LR75wOa9
.@united are interested in mass new customer acquisition, not rewarding loyalty.
.@united has gone from a customer focused business that rewards loyalty, to a bus in the sky that nickels and dimes everyone for everything
@beornborg @united It‚Äôs management plain and simple. This is how a company like @united crumbles. They change their monetization model.
@united Is your computer broken? You have my full name. I‚Äôm sitting on a tarmac in 1A with a bunch of pissed off passengers. Chicago to IAD.
By @united staff @IAD &amp; many other places including attendants (as recently as yesterday) that if you‚Äôre not in a tie you belong in the back
@GarethDEdwards @united And not saying it‚Äôs bad to fly economy or something we‚Äôve done that many times and still do for personal travel. It‚Äôs just the assumption
@GarethDEdwards @united The @united staff says ‚Äúsir economy check in line is on the other side‚Äù. It‚Äôs happened so many times you can‚Äôt even count.
Oh that‚Äôs not all. You should see IAD ground staff. Every time we go to 1k check in (I literally see these people every weekend)‚Ä¶. @united https://t.co/GfYYosK6ZU
It‚Äôs not that, its what the flight attendant insinuated. Like, we hadn‚Äôt paid for @united business tickets. https://t.co/CEvubNu7Gw
@lacyinwonderlnd @united Seriously why do we spend hard earned money on a company like @united that treats us (and others) like complete s%#t
.@united : this https://t.co/AkjJ0olODp
@united No, I can‚Äôt do your job for you. Sorry. You muppets figure it out. We want our flights for the entire weekend paid for and an apology.
@united No I can‚Äôt DM you details. You can call my wife or me for details. We are absolutely appauled what‚Äôs become of this airline.
And also @united you should be using the United application to alert passengers to aircraft problems so they can stay in their hotels/home
.@united you should be giving staff sensitivity training to not deeply insult long time customers because they aren‚Äôt in a business suit
Super angry @united passengers deplaning and everyone sitting here pissed off with little announcement of what is happening.
So finally, today, we are flying from Chicago to IAD and get here. MORE @united maintainence problems. And we are sitting on the runway
And show before my performance last night in Chicago. Making last night super stressful.
So on the @united delayed flight from Dallas to Chicago with uber rude staff, we get there late and then are rushing to a family dinner
Thats a true story. Can you imagine? I‚Äôve been flying @united airlines for 20 years. To be treated this way is beyond the pale of insulting.
So this @united flight attendant looks at him and then at me, and says ‚ÄúYeah our real problem is too many free upgrades‚Äù
This passenger said to her he was a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù and was annoyed I had a pile of laptops and Roli blocks all over my seat.
Next @United flight from Dallas to Chicago? More problems, rude flight staff. On this one flight attendant was talking to another passenger
From this one @united flight, we were able to spend less time with our family in Dallas, and made my performance there Friday very stressful
On Friday @united flight from IAD to Dallas, delayed for hours, deplaned‚Ä¶rude flight staff and they gave us a bottle of water.
This weekend alone @united has for my wife, my daughter and myself‚Ä¶plainly screwed up all our family plans and travel to performances.
Bags lots too many times to count (literally Employees are obviously under tremendous duress and the chain of command seems to be a disaster
After that our family has been accepted in and then thrown out of Global Service several times, treated like crap by flight staff(s)
It really started downhill after the @united and continental merger. Before that it was a fantastic airline, great customer service
I have to say @united airlines has gone from the best to the worst airline on earth in a few short years
Chicago! Can‚Äôt wait to see you guys tonight at @themidchicago with @shane54music.   But first‚Ä¶sushi at @Sunda
@valleeffect we are about to launch a new site.

Smells like analog synthesizers and cinnamon in here. Let‚Äôs do this.
For real check out tPowerDX7 guy on Youtube. He‚Äôs been BLOWING my mind. Pulse width mod pads and poly plucks. Insane https://t.co/vUr5P6PVFA
Unfortunately 12 bit DAC is a ton of the magic @laughing_mantis @djtt88 Once you get your head around some vintage FM there is no going back
It‚Äôs just tons of memorization @djtt88. Learning what algorithms are good for what and what harmonics occur naturally in what instruments.
Start by checking out PowerDX7 on youtube @_tableforone that guy is the best FM programmer I‚Äôve EVER heard. Ever.
It‚Äôs absolutely extraordinary. And can as rich and warm as subtractive analog synthesis. After all, look at Eno. DX7+H3000=MAGIC
I have to say @djtt88 FM synthesis has always been daunting to me, but Ive finally bit the bullet and am learning it inside out.
Of course everything has it‚Äôs place. There are wonderful soft instruments that do completely new things. But, analog polys speak to my heart
They are a physical event. And this makes them completely different. When you record one you record an event not a computation.
But mostly what it is, is that they are not a stream of numbers in a computer. They are electrons coursing through circuits.
And the forced workflow and the haptic feedback you get from these instruments, I could go on and on.
And what is so different from a physical synthesizer, drum machine or modular synthesizer. Part is how gloriously unpredictable they are.
Reading fantastic book about subtractive and FM programing this morning from the 80‚Äôs &amp; something occurred to me, why I love synths so much
Gym, study, studio repeat. Beast mode today.

Got the OB-6 midi‚Äôd up to my OBXa and am dying over here. These two are peanut butter and chocolate. Blowing my mind.

My last tweet before official announcements: if there were a synthesizer based on Spectral Convolution, it‚Äôd be the greatest thing ever.
@unknownfear google is your friend

@weatherchannel Your odds of a fatal shark attack are 1 in 11.5 million worldwide. Driving in your car is more dangerous.
@weatherchannel 100 million sharks on average are killed every. single. year. And to help stop that, people have to be less scared of them.
Hey @weatherchannel, this (https://t.co/BTit5O4RaZ) is not cool. Way to go making shark propaganda to frighten people.

With aspiration and hope in my heart, I am looking forward to 2017. I'm ready to turn over a new leaf.
I can say without reservation, amongst my family, my close friends, our country and in the world, 2016 was a pretty bad year.
George's voice was one of my favorites &amp; I found it so inspiring he produced &amp; sang. Along w/Prince he is someone I always wanted to meet.
I am so saddened to hear of the passing of George Michael and Carrie Fisher. Leia was my 14yr old crush and Faith one my my fav albums ever.

@ValerieAlanis21 it's like going to @Spotify for a royalty check lol.
@ValerieAlanis21 let's start with not using "good music" and @atsoundcloud in the same sentence.
Dude. This. Is. INSANE. https://t.co/JMroWoiJft
But where I hope it's headed, is audiences domestically, demand more interesting, less formulaic, more educated electronic music.
Well I can answer actually, all the EDM guys that have jumped on the deep bandwagon are about to start making bad techno.
I get asked in interviews a lot "where is dance music headed". I can't answer that, but I can answer where I hope it's headed.
Are struggling in the culture set in place by big corporate festivals and perpetuated by horrible music and myopic/uneducated artists
In all seriousness, it kind of hurts my heart some that such talented people (I'm talking same conversation with a dozen producers you know)
Make a dry board we can sit by the campfire and read together. 1. I will never set the tempo of my DAW to 128 again 2. I will delete Nexus
So maybe I should start a summer camp for disgruntled dance music producers. We can zip line, trust building exercises, go fishing. Lol
That they "need to get away from EDM" and how am I allowed to "make music I like?"
I get DM's, Emails &amp; Texts daily from friends and peers that are extremely successful dance music producers asking if they can "come visit"
Funny thing I'm going to share with you guys this morning. Couple tweets to follow, no names will be mentioned.

@andih72 no not at all. It's fairly unrelated to all my other works.
@Teaboy_thurible and good art directly addresses and parses subtext and emotional complexity by its very nature. Hence, "she".
@Teaboy_thurible if for no other reason than because of their astute ability to communicate emotionally, women are more inherently complex
@Teaboy_thurible great question. I think even the most masculine of creative works is inherently let's say at least 51% feminine.
@cwharris and my advice to people that want to make music or any kind of art, anything really, is do you HAVE to do it? If yes, start doing.
@cwharris because of a quite literal biological imperative. I am literally compelled to make sound.
@jaminbradley a nighttime drive is a good idea for sure.

@macdigger it will alright! In fact is sound blinding in just 5.1. The mix is not adapted for this environment it's redone. Truly beautiful!
Absolute BEAST mode in the studio. 7/8 rhythms at 160+ bpm FTW!
@macdigger @BlackHoleRec kind of like how a Ferrari is "only" away to get from point A to point B.
@macdigger yes the "only" thing that is new is 1,000 hours of face melting 9.1 surround mixing. Only. Lol.

Without question or compromise, we are sharing this with you exactly as we want as a band. If you "get it" it'll be your fav thing ever.
So to get started, if you don't have one of these: you're gonna need one! Here's one for 50$ https://t.co/JPVkKnsvdl
There is a physicality to the way we created this EP and upcoming album that is palpable. Literal blood, sweat and tears.
We made this album on instruments from a largely forgotten era in music making. Vintage modulars, reel to reel analog tape machines etc.
Part of what makes this project so special is how personally passionate we are about the songs and the way it was created.
Beyond excited to announce All Hail @thesilence speaking for both of us this is one of the most special projects we've ever done. Ever.
Appears some very smart fans have figured out what we are up too. Tomorrow is gonna be a big day. All Hail @TheSilence.
There is some actual fan hacking going on right now. Lol! #AllHailTheSilence üî•

And a final shout out to my buddy @DSIsequential because I just read they used lots of Daves#'s Prophet 6. And man this score is ANALOG.
There you have it @stranger_things is an absolute masterpiece. If it doesn't win every award this year, someone did it wrong. WATCH IT NOW!
We are talking shades of new order, Blancmange, The Blue Nile, Tangerine Dream, @thehorrormaster. Absolute analog 80's synth lushness.
W/rooms filled w/vintage poly synths. Ahem üò≥ I digress. Kevin Dixon and Michael Stein killed it so hard with this score it's indescribable.
The music? WOW. First I should say I have major and I mean major score envy. This is like the dream job for someone who grew up in the 80's
It is so authentic, stylistically, aesthetically, in sound and scope to movies from this time period it's like scary.
If you crossed The Goonies, ET, Donnie Darko &amp; about 100 other of my favorite movies you'd get Stranger Things. It's a work of pure genius
The new @Netflix show @Stranger_Things directed by The Duffer brothers is one of the greatest things I've EVER watched in my entire life.
In lieu of citing my track record of picking things that are awesome. EVERYONE LISTEN UP.
Now let's start here, this is the guy that told you The Band Perry would win everything with "If I die Young" before it was on the radio :)
First, thanks @BlakeLewis for hipping me to quite possibly one of the greatest things I've ever watched. Ever. (Including some 80's favs)

Love the enthusiasm. This is gonna happen for sure. Anyone with a working multi-cam system and just general feedback, I'm super listening!
.@MJMSessions okay killer I'll look this up. Would you recommend a stand alone rig? Mac/PC? Can you do camera switching in that software?
This is a great point @Mariandipietra ! So 2-3 cameras and a screenshare. Anyone know of a camera switch that would work real time?
Also anyone with experience, what's the optimal way to go? Individual computer? Mac/PC? Best cameras? Way to stream HD audio? I'm listening!
Thinking about setting up a multi cam (GoPro?) setup to stream live sessions, producing, modular and sound design sessions. Interested?

No current gear list @felixbird and yes it's a Samsung 40" 4K display. I love it.
@TiagoJoseMC yes because Its one of the few albums of mine I own and I don't want it on Spotify.

We're planing my new studio literally down to 1/16" of an inch of tolerance. Gonna be amazing. What a puzzle!
Dear film directors, kindly bring back the 90's thriller. Thanks in advance.
Grateful for the sacrifice of the brave men and women that keep our country  safe and free.
It's a beautiful day for a studio break and a walk. Fantastic new music in progress.
7:21 of the densest, most elegant, detailed music I've ever made done done. Things are a' brewing!
Love to hear this.  https://t.co/7kl8cRKahu

Profoundly well said @irvingazoff Music community this is a must read. Listen up @YouTube. https://t.co/MTZOSugBOl
@DarienFaust @syd_viciously @AvalonHollywood @MaxGraham @JohnnyYono you say this as if it‚Äôs past tense. *is amazing
Right now it looks like a @UAudio Thunderbolt Octo @AlexRugerMusic one day soon it won't look like anything, it'll be the cloud.
Instead of stagnating in 40 year old ideas, push sound design &amp; electronic music truly forward in to the future w/reverence for the past.
So let's embrace synthesis poineers, use an off computer platform for DSP and think of new things that make exciting new forms of sound.
Of current computer systems (even though modern computers are insanely powerful).
And lots of developers compromise on audio fidelity and or functionality because of the computational load of their designs and limitations
Because now in a handful of SHARC chips we have the power of hundred Synclaviers or Hartmann Neurons.
&amp; secondary but important though is I wish all my friends that are software developers would get behind a single "off computer" DSP platform
And give them the platform from which to birth new ideas. Cameron Jones, Axel Hartmann, these guys need to be designing new instruments.
At any rate a couple things need to happen that aren't happening right now. We need to embrace the creators of these pioneering instruments
As a point of digression this is also why I think The Beatles are the greatest band ever, because they combined "new" with fantastic songs.
I'd say, that excites me more than music in general. Sounds I've never heard. Elegant, academic, expansive, agressive, doesn't matter, NEW
With reference and reverence to the past of course but that's how this music started. The want to hear sounds we'd never heard before.
Who needs another subtractive synthesizer? Shouldn't we all want to push electronic music soundscapes into the future?
Is the minds of the people that created these new and or addendum's to new synthesis modalities. Now there is so much imitation in synthesis
Occurs to me the most important thing about a synthesizer like this that broke ground (literally making sounds we'd all never heard)
I am so inspired by this Synclavier V development. What a stunning sounding instrument. It's absolutely blowing my mind.
Brain is exploding with ideas this lovely, rainy Saturday morning. Apologies in advance for the so not "140" character, thought train!
Thanks for the love! https://t.co/bvcdHVKjCG
I do this too for the record. Any song you've of mine you've ever heard I've done this with. On a quiet country road https://t.co/oI1wyq3aj8
Can't wait to play Paradiso!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Washington.  https://t.co/pNTAOnTD5C
Everyone would buy that as a main controller. To the original specs. Poly aftertouch, military grade components, Dave Smith T8 keyboards.
Today's million dollar matchmaking idea. Dear @ArturiaOfficial partner with @UAudio to run Synclavier V AND make a run of USB Orc keyboards
Hot damn @SwitchedOnTX !!! Want the first one. Can't wait.
üëäüèª https://t.co/6hHC4DxO3i
So @ArturiaOfficial Synclavier + @iZotopeInc Ozone 7 + @valhalladsp Room have officially, completely and totally melted my brain. STUNNING.
It's like Christmas 1978 up in here. DLing the Synclavier FM engine and waiting for @SwitchedOnTX to open so I can pre-order a NEW MODEL D!
Part two: @moogmusicinc is re-releasing to the original spec the MODEL D (wait for it) with MIDI and a dedicated LFO. I can't even.
Part one: Arturia has collaborated with the creator of the Synclavier, using original code and made a PLUGIN OF ITS FM SYNTHESIS! üò≥
Buckle up gearheads today is probably the best day in synthesis for like 10 years. I wish they'd spaced out the good news! Insanity. Ready?
@andygrayedout can't wait to hear it. Will do :)
Flocking algorithms, Mandelbrot set, Golden Mean, Lorenz attractors @BC_Man you can find all that and more in the last 20 years of my music.
Told you guys, Paul has found more than anyone! https://t.co/eeZt1ivDZZ
üò≥üëÄüí•üëäüèª https://t.co/UQ2K1mw9LE
.@reneesales @BC_Man Paul rightfully holds the claim to having found more than anyone I've ever met! I'll RT some of you post them @dalnat
No one has found that one @BC_Man but yes you can make fractals in music. That one took me about 3 weeks to make by hand. üòä
So hears one I'll tell you about @BC_Man there is a nano-rhythmic fractal of the entire composition The Internal Locus, hidden in the song
A number have been found @BC_Man and once or twice a year I'll meet people that find these intentional hidden musical meanings, puns etc
This has never come up @BC_Man (I've never publicly talked about it at least) but lots of my music has Easter eggs in it.
Absolute pleasure :) https://t.co/NXLM9pz0OP

And that Apple will lead this charge @adomus07 I also think it'll be terrible but writing is on the wall.
I think people will completely abandon the sale of music @adomus07 and only support streaming.
I have a prediction I've not read anywhere yet. Apple will phase out iTunes inside 3 years. What do you guys think?
@Richard_Grey it wasn't "us guys". I made this song on an MP60 Korg O3r Juno106 and a General Music S2. I mixed it on a Boss 8 channel mixer
Home for the most beautiful day ever. Headed to Sunday service and then some studio time. Happy Sunday.
üëçüèª @Richard_Grey I wrote Cassa de X straight out of Berklee. Secondary sub-dominant Eb chord was Sharams idea. Jk. https://t.co/C0cs06Pn1C

For sure big announcement coming soon @The_Typer @TheRealHeadshot @XenonMazi
Just checked @TheRealHeadshot @XenonMazi 300 million people will here the music I've written in person this year. But only in person.
Hundreds of thousands of people will hear it every year, @TheRealHeadshot @XenonMazi but only in person, in Shanghai China!
You'll have to come to Shanghai to hear it @XenonMazi, it'll never be released and a stereo recording could never capture this magic.
Today, will also involve a couple hours of serious fun. If I was not NDA'd I'd have the worlds most epic Instagram feed right now, ever.
This entire project has been such an extraordinary experience. This last round of mixing in crazy speaker arrays is icing on the cake.
Last day/night of mixing in Shanghai. Absolutely mind blowing speaker arrays. First time I've ever mixed for a quad channel in a 9ft hole.
@djthd no @btcare are. Learn to work Twitter.

@adomus07 @nicholaspersac I don't know any artists that have control of their music. That's a pretty presumptuous assumption.

Pumped for the studio today. First, time to vote.
@spiffy_spence @ElectronicOpus you on a Mac or PC I can teach you to command line format this SUDO in OSX terminal.

If there was a survey asking if she likes kick drums and loud orchestral musiic, I'd have given it. So far blaring Prince, we're all good.
I'm tired of looking the other way when I can do something helpful. Even something small. So welcome to our family, we've named her Pearl
She's had a hard knock life but is so loving and sweet it just felt like the absolute right thing to do.
Turns out she was terribly attacked by a dog years ago that scarred her sweet little head and killed her litter of kittens.
She was feral but cared for by the next door neighbors at our Air B&amp;B. They were overjoyed we would take her because they were very allergic
Well, went to Nashville, had piles of productive meetings, danced to country music and adopted a new cat.

Thank you Prince for the music. Goodnight.
Sign of the Times, The Black Album, Dirty Mind, Delirious...these are literally how I learned to program drum machines. He will be so missed
His influence is omnipotent. Who else has ever written a bitonal pop song (Scandalous)? Such a blessing to have his rich catalogue of music.
After a night on the town in Nashville, talking to @lacyinwonderlnd and @DomiPaul about the genius that was Prince. What a gift he was.
Just found a book called "Don't forget to Sing in the Lifeboats". Without even reading, pretty sure this will be one of my favorites ever.

@givertake I did make hits with those floppy disks, lol! CLONE/SEND!!!
And before you ask, I mowed about a million laws to buy that program when I was a kid (not including updates).
Hey tweeps, anybody got the last release version of Voyetra Sequencer + (4.11) not 4.10? 4.11 Apparently allows dual MIDI ports in DOS!
@jesseredniss @kaimac @ewood02 @bdainton @snackmantis piano mic ( @Adele) üòâ
@timwells15 sorry bout that, sometimes I get a little block crazy when @BTcare is on the fritz
Well @TheGRAMMYs were awesome this year. My absolute favorite part? https://t.co/AlTTLuuIts Hero John Cage, won a Grammy. Great night!
And in other news a sound guy is about to be beheaded. Real life. Wow, way to go @Adele. Serious pro.
Everyone listening, that's what your hearing. Sounded like prepared piano. Insane that has be nearly impossible to sing to. What a pro.
Talk about a professional. Way to go @Adele holding it down when a piano mic falls in the piano @TheGRAMMYs
Also considering mapping mod wheel to Y axis on my @WeAreROLI and Expression to poly aftertouch. Wow this is actually an insane idea.
@Junkie_XL putting that epic synth collection to good use! Rock on üëçüèª
Alright fellow producers, anybody built a X/Y Touch OSC template for cc1 and cc2? Need one for iPad! Go!!

@_1ee you can start worrying really hard right now (because it's awesome) or get really excited it's coming (because it's awesome)
@_1ee @ElectronicOpus don‚Äôt worry, people are still receiving their physical rewards daily :)
Want to get inspired? I mean REALLY inspired? Watch this and pass it on. This is amazing. https://t.co/SydPyHuskK
A succinct answer would be I've never identified as a "DJ/producer" @natebessa always as a composer and artist.

One of the coolest things I saw at #NAMM was the @SubPac backpack. I think if I wear this with my @BlueMicrophones Mofi's I may explode.
Director says (composer of the temp music who'll remain nameless but has the same initials) "Dude owes you money" More hysterical laughter.
And his assistant pulls him over and goes "BT invented that" and everyone was like üò≥ Absolutely hysterical.
Funny #StutterEdit story from yesterday a director was showing me a mock trailer saying "dude we want this stuff that spins down" like this!

@Authorportrait outstanding.
Squad goals do #NAMMage @lacyinwonderlnd @christianburns_ @RichardDevine @amberdevine@AmberDevine1 @OfficialFractal
Okay first, when you see this on every shirt  2017, we made it up...
My point is this: if you want to innovate  you must do two things 1. Know the language 2. Know what came before you.
In actuality you're like "ever heard of John Cage? He did that 50 years ago"
I think this is why you frequently see young artists and producers with this myopic idea they are doing something revolutionary when...
The overwhelming implication is somehow not knowing traditional harmony, theory, how to read music etc makes you more creative or something.
It's like "I can't read a note, never studied anything". Congrats your illiterate. I actually don't know how to respond when people say this
Music is the only profession that people brag about not studying it. Am I the only musician this strikes as strange?
My #NAMM click : @lacyinwonderlnd @christianburns_ @RichardDevine @amber698 @OfficialFractal it's so game on.
Yes playing at Ministry of Sound in March @ritamoraruk

So if you want to contribute, truly learn your craft whatever that is and build from a strong foundation. Always.
And a final thought, something can be successful temporarily and have no merit or longevity. And this is why dance music is stuck in a loop.
So if you're "getting by" doing the minimum etc : basically cheating, this reflects ultimately the sustainability of your work.
Hopefully this inspires a new thought in you creative types, the foundation from which you build determines the merit of the entire work.
Realized about half my work is creating an array of material, instruments, design &amp; workflow to draw from, in the hopes of birthing unicorns
There‚Äôs a bajillion things you can do with this technique. Try delays, flangers etc. You‚Äôll flip out if you‚Äôve never done this. Enjoy!
You can also fade out and reverse all the chords and put them under your progression for ear candy (and something not out of a sample pack!)
Better still cut the Emin arp reverb and put it after the Cmaj reverb reverse on the down beat. Presto tonal riser into tonic tonal crash.
Here‚Äôs a couple favorites. Take the 8 bars of Shimmer for the Cmaj chord and fade it out. Reverse it. You just made a sick riser.
You now have 4x 10 bar sounds (2 bars each of a chord arpeggiated &amp; 8 of a reverb throw) Now at this stage there‚Äôs so many things you can do
NEXT! Grab Valhalla Shimmer. Tune it up 7 (a fifth) and crank the decay to taste (longer is better here. Okay print that and cut it up.
In fact arpeggiate your whole progression &amp; split it into those chords. Now take 2 bar arpeggiated chords &amp; put 8 bars of silence after each
Take that chord &amp; make a short plucky sine wave (in anything) sharp attack quick decay to zero. Now arpeggiate your Cmaj chord at 32nd notes
Let‚Äôs say the progression is Em Dm Gmaj Cmaj. The chord before the tonic is a Cmaj. Okay. Let‚Äôs say that chord lasts 2 bars. With me so far?
Alright, producer tip of the day. Instead of sh**ty risers try this. It‚Äôs a couple step trick. Let‚Äôs say your chord progression is in Em
@Junkie_XL I‚Äôd love to hear some of your modular stuff man :)
@Junkie_XL AND Euro too! I‚Äôve got some dotcom sequencers &amp; I‚Äôve used a system some. They definitely sound vintage and are very musical
A pleasure.  https://t.co/ufmpHURg4S
@AndyBo1977 @TommyTallarico @tanzgroup @alexharrow no worries. Sorry it's taken so long.
@Junkie_XL love it man I didn't know you were a dotcom guy. Sweet setup!
@AndyBo1977 they're on there way by Christmas! @TommyTallarico do you get Kickstarter emails? I've never seen them. https://t.co/WtgIRN5OT8
Enjoyed this conversation immensely. We just went straight nerdcore. Love it. Blessings to all and goodnight :)
@tmad40blue incredible. I just wonder if with my obsessive focus it would literally make me crazy. It sounds like an incredible gift though.
Fascinating @tmad40blue do you notice the Pythagorean coma? Ever played a Yamaha CP70? Too many questions!
I've used Just Intonation a lot. The moving parallel fifths in the bass in Every Other Way for example.
Do you prefer Just Intonation or math tunings like Pythagorean to our 12 note hack @tmad40blue?
That fascinates me to no end @tmad40blue. I always lusted for perfect pitch as a kid. I've got great relative pitch though.
Awesome @tmad40blue! Out of curiosity what does non-12 tone music sound like to you? Gamelan for example. Do you like or drives you nuts?
All the minor 9 vocal rubs that Martin sings against Dave too @earthdyedred those guys blow my effing mind.
Totally @earthdyedred at times bordering on bi-tonality. Best pop example of that being the brilliant Prince's 'Scandalous'
@ObediaTutor the computer you guys made me is stunning man. So much thanks :)
Lots of fantastic inner voice movement with Depeche/Vince/Martin, fantastic modulation a and modal interchange too @earthdyedred
Tell you what, lesson 1, Depeche Mode's entire catalogue.
There must be other people out there that think (like I do) about the harmonic interaction of these new forms, if even just intuitively.
We have a bajillion new tonal colors to work with from subtractive synthesis to granular clouds and spectral abstractions.
I've thought about writing a syllabus for Full Sail or Berklee for modern counterpoint &amp; orchestration class. This would be epic useful.
Any other musicians here ALWAYS thinking counterpoint? The vocal against the bass, the inner voices (usually synths), It's non-stop for me.
A full day of counterpoint is like solving a Ribik's cube a thousand times. Passing tones, parallel fifths and unavailable tensions oh my.
About 35 finished minutes of beautiful music over the last 4 days. Grateful for sound, my family and the natural world. Goodnight.
Happy Hanukkah to my Jewish friends and followers. Just reading tonight's prayer. It's a beautiful one and a beautiful tradition.
@VxJasonxV it people doing indigenous singing and it's improvisational. Rotfling
@VxJasonxV but since IMA came out 1994 this in 2009 this is clear copyright infringement and an unlicensed sample. Thanks for the heads up.
@VxJasonxV it's not a sample. It's a field recording I made of Monkey Chanting. I've never heard this track until now.
@LessThan3 @Berghain check this out @erinsharoni it's some of the actual things we discussed. What a great read.
This is awesome. A fantastic read. Congratulations.  https://t.co/LVfhYUXzS8

@MarkThePoet @christianburns_ @thesilence @chikadee12282 big happy birthday from me :)
They're insane. Best headphones ever. https://t.co/GVeoOk1BAv
@LegendaryCoffee out atm thanks for asking.
Using RX to make INSANE new drum one shots . Frequency specific compositing my analog drum machines and Eurorack.
@RobsRecStudio with you there
And the world's most powerful supercomputer, BlueGene, can manage only .002% of that
Amazing: If the human brain were a computer, it could perform 38 thousand-trillion operations per second.
Going through so much material from the IMA &amp; ESCM time period for mastering that's never seen the light of day 12min of Flaming June? yep!
It's a beautiful day for a post turkey workout. Still glowing with gratitude from yesterday.
@Kcijseries I'd recommend Kontakt and libraries. Best strings are LASS and Spitfire Albion II, Berlin and Cinematic Strings for staccato
Hope you all have a blessed, beautiful Thanksgiving. We‚Äôre cooking up a storm over here.
Insanity these Berlin Spiccato string articulations. These are incredible. Even better than LASS (my other favorite for this articulation)
So today I did assignments on 27 private stock pianos and 182 self-made surround percussion libraries. Slowly but surely!
Multiple time lines of controller data in the piano roll editor, intelligent quantize functions, it's scary good.
Cubase is SO advanced to Logic in every way it's actually staggering. Destructive audio (real hard processing with multi-level undo)
Setting up the autoload assignments in @steinburg Cubase is coming along great too. Crazy routing audio with meta frames and channel strips
This VEPro @pcaudiabs PC is incredible. Hardest thing I've ever set up in my life. I'm like 3 weeks in w/700 instrument autoload in progress
@calebjams yes the @BlueMicrophones mofi are STUNNING for that application
Got some amazing score cues out the door this am and rediscovering some SynthEdit 32Bit gems before headed out for a fall festival.
There's a beautiful moonbow here tonight. Feeling grateful for my family and friends. Have you all have a blessed Friday night :)
Wow.  https://t.co/N6AL10pCBw
@AmplifiedHitman coming to you soon! Promise.
@kdobs12 email laptopsymphony.assist@gmail.com for help
No I mean a netbook becomes a noded 1 million CPU supercomputer @Mariandipietra. Think HAL but real.
Fast forward a couple years, fast internet, server farm, offload heavy lifting DSP, deep sampled instruments over the cloud. #Thefuture
Feel like I‚Äôm glimpsing the future setting up VEPro rig. I can see where all this is going. MIDI and Audio over ethernet, no latency..hmm
I can‚Äôt wait to share what I‚Äôve been working on. Keeping a project silent for over a year has been one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done.
@tweetsfrmAltair you need all the @valhalladsp there‚Äôs no way around it. Go in this order, Room, Shimmer, Plate, Vintage.
@tomerbe @valhalladsp you‚Äôll literally hear it all over it. The bending metal type stuff. It‚Äôs magical with Make Noise wogglebug.
@cmmorrow because the American record label hated/didn‚Äôt understand it
Went to tuck my daughter in &amp; found her doing the Harlem Shake to Ride off Movement in Still Life. File under most epic moment of the week
@tomerbe @valhalladsp it's brilliant Tom. Probably my fav Eurorack module ever. It's all over my Dark Places score. Like, entire cues.
@valhalladsp @tomerbe it'd be amazing for you to make something like this ITB, surround etc would be so INCREDIBLE.
@valhalladsp @tomerbe modulating the available parameters is psychotic. Super musical and unlike anything else
@valhalladsp @tomerbe part of what special about Erbverb isn't just exposed parameters it's how wide the range is. You can "break" it
@valhalladsp @tomerbe totally understand the challenge! Consider this an official request for a reverb for Sound Designers üëç
@valhalladsp I'll check this out for sure! I've been a fan of @tomerbe since early 90's Soundhack (which I still use today constantly)
Easily a 250-425$ product @valhalladsp I'll try Unobtanium my Matrix 12 &amp; Prophet 5 this afternoon. Can't wait. Thanks for the great stuff
Too it off by exposing every parameter &amp; making it "breakable" (like Erbverb) i.e. Self oscillate etc and you've got THE best reverb ever.
Throw in a couple LFO's and clockable step sequencers mapable to ANY parameter, have @RichardDevine design you crazy surround IR's
A 2 part engine, part 1 convolution, part 2 early and late reflections (your @valhalladsp algorithms) and everything in surround.
I have an idea for you Sean I think everyone would buy. Take all your @valhalladsp algorithms, and bundle into a new Reverb plugin where...
Hey @valhalladsp I wanted to congratulate you Sean, Plate is phenomenal. My favorite algorithm is "Unobtanium". Monstrous on percussion.
@rexnjay which dot rev? PM me!
Anyone got legit installer of the last PC version of Alchemy? Still have my serial numbers &amp; expansions, just need installer for VEPro rig!
Beast mode on Episode 106 of Wicked City. I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre gonna see it but the music is effing awesome.
Here's something you've never heard me say before, WOW on the new @justinbieber album. Killer work @Skrillex (and trainspotted #Stutteredit)
Music to picture composers, have to check this out. I beta‚Äôd this thing it‚Äôs STUNNING. https://t.co/UXAQGaELao

Anyone here with significant Kontakt scripting experience? Pass it around, looking for a programmer for hire to do custom scripting.
Almost in NY to shoot the cover of @djmag. It's a beautiful Sunday day for a drive. Enjoying some @Anjunadeep
Been in contemplative prayer for Paris and the citizens of France. My thoughts are with you and the families of the victims.

Praying for Paris. Please do the same.
@daviddas and I'm thinking wormhole or something similar to connect them.
Hey @daviddas yes I'd love to know how you connect these. Are they on the same computer? I want to run Mainstage on a separate rig.

@ErinSharoni pleasure was mine. Really enjoyed your candor and knowledge was truly impressive.
@DJmag @rjmcAssey @Anjunadeep @ErinSharoni she's someone who "gets it". Whatever you're paying her, it should be more.
Just had the best interview ever with @djmag Thanks Erin for the absolutely fantastic questions.
Thanks guys!! https://t.co/fABCuL0cnN
Watching my score of #WickedCity and feeling really proud of the music I've written. #superproud
@daviddas just figured out this won't work for me because I use lots of surround instances of EXS24 and Mainstage doesn't support surround
Man that's amazing @daviddas also the last version of alchemy for OSX is still available I believe and much nicer UI than the new one.
@lacyinwonderlnd that looks AMAZING
@djNaotaku like a professional program not a kids toy. Transition will be over the course of the next 2 projects and take an est 6-8 months
Anyone use a large MainStage multi-instrument controlled by IAC bus/VEPro? I‚Äôm working on a cool hack to use my Logic instruments w/Cubase
@thracianmusic mac‚Äôs have a shelf life of 18 months. I can replace a cpu for 1/10 the cost of a new mac. Oh and that 300G RAM, let‚Äôs be real

.@Kcijseries would love to hear what you come up with. Get inspired, not overwhelmed üòä
Hey @Kcijseries thank you for the compliment. In regards to the rest of what you said, your bar should always be one upping YOUR best :)
@Junkie_XL excited to see you on here btw man. Followed :)
@Junkie_XL well say a little prayer for me then man, cause truth be told I'm terrified but I think I'm gonna do it. Fingers crossed!
@Noisia_nl super agree with this too man.
@djdruso I was explaining my own personal compositional requirements.
@djdruso of course the number of tracks doesn't matter. Some of my favorite recordings are stereo masters.
@lae_eric @UAudio absolutely. They work amazing and their emulations crush literally every other company. Hands down.
@mennodejong and I'd love to hear a Trance track with 70-100 tracks because I've seen all the big guys sessions and they're all 30-40 tracks
For scoring stuff @mennodejong I need access to 1,500-2,000 instruments all the time, without loading. I just have different requirements
So again taking Every Other Way for example @mennodejong that's 789 tracks. I nearly killed the computer.
@rfwhyte @UAudio 1176 or LA2a Grey.
Composers @davedresden
And my final tweet of this production rant. Young producers, seasoned producers...the best plugins available now are @UAudio hands down.
And not saying it's bad @mennodejong either, I like some of this music, it's just not Stravinsky. We can agree on this I'll assume.
Let's be real @mennodejong what makes up your typical Beatport #1 trance track. 30-40 tracks? Midi, some risers? It's not heavy lifting.
Apple makes beautiful, overpriced, non-upgradable paper weights. For a third of the price you get 3 times the power with a PC.
And finally for the record, although I have them all over my studio. The days of Apple being the go to professional creatives tool are over
Cubase is the most serious, open ended tool and the most widely used by professional film composers.
Protools is a very expensive tape deck with good plugins and insufficient Midi Implementation (but better than Logic) and....
DAW landscape is as follows now : Logic is for Pop, hip-hop and EDM commercial music. FL and Live are the serious DAW's for dance music
I didn't know you were using this too Tom @Junkie_XL was the switch hard for you?
Sweet man I've already got a million questions @Noisia_nl I'm gonna email you for sure üòä
Via VEPro @christianthon than, buckle up, ready for it...LOGIC's INTERNAL INSTRUMENTS.
Logic is so slow and unresponsive so this is not saying a ton but it's faster to send midi over Ethernet and get the audio back Ethernet
VEPro is easily and I mean easily the most amazing technology I've seen in at least 10 years @christianthon
@Noisia_nl really appreciate this man. I'm switching.
And it cost 1/3 the price. So here‚Äôs my question‚Ä¶.anybody out there using Cubase on a Mac? Does it do destructive editing? Do you like it?
The server class PC I just bought has 56 CPU threads available (as opposed to Mac‚Äôs 12), and 300G of RAM as opposed to 64G.
First step is looking at other DAW‚Äôs, next step (and this one will take some time) is abandoning the Mac altogether.
I need about 2,000+ deep sampled Kontakt and Play instruments on at all times. VEPro can handle this perfect. A mac with Logic X can‚Äôt
Which is insulting for a computer this expensive. So it‚Äôs time to actually look elsewhere in ernest. In order to do compositional work‚Ä¶
For me, on the most expensive Mac Pro with 64G (max) of RAM and the best video card, I get about 40 deep sampled Contact instruments
Seems there‚Äôs even more I didn‚Äôt know about the inner workings of the new Logic. Here‚Äôs the big news, if it works for you, it works for you.
Just had a massive (earth shattering) conversation with developers on the inside track about Logic, it‚Äôs audio engine and midi handling
Appreciate the kind words. So proud of this record and happy you guys are feeling it! https://t.co/pu3P9nt4A5
Thank you :) https://t.co/rXhvR3Pk6j
I hear #StutterEdit in country music all the time @BCamTX in fact there was a moment in the vocal breakdown for new Zac Brown song on CMA's
@simoncpage this is a @TommyTallarico and @tanzgroup question
And so wether you like country music or not, (and I happen to love it) it deserves our respect. It has mine.
And even more exciting, there is a comradery and community amongst artists and a respect for music, musicianship, family, country, faith
No asshats making things more better or stage diving with CDJ's off or glorification of objectification of women because it's not tolerated
You know why? Not tolerated in Country Music. Musicianship, songwriting, engineering is spectacular. People that have refined their craft
In short no ones a fraud.
No caddy drama/infighting between artists. People freely collaborating. Zac Brown Band, Keith Urban, Miranda Lambert+others just killing it
Next, no autotune anywhere to be found. Live performances were incredible. No one playing to tracks. Performance after performance.
Firstly, Girl Crush (rightfully) won everything like I said it would. Grammy's are next. Best song since "If I Die Young" by The Band Perry
Took a scoring break and watched part of the CMA's last night. Was shocked (in a good way) about many overarching attributes of the show
Hooking up @PCAudioLabs VEPro rig. Excited would be the understatement of the century. This is the Synclavier for 2015 #HelloOrchestraInaBox
Happy Halloween you guys. I'm so happy to not be in a club right now I could cry.

It's a great pleasure to announce I've composed the score for the fantastic @ABCNetwork new crime drama #WickedCity staring @EdWestwick
What if I told you you could hear an hour of that music next Tuesday at 10pm on prime time TV? Idk maybe something scary before Halloween?
What the crazy scoring project is that I've been playing guitar &amp; frame drums w/knives! Well I've written close to 4hrs of music in 2 weeks

@JasonDefine it's stunning. It kills me people get embarrassed it was their first DAW. If it was mine, I'd never ever ever switch.
Next DAW to give a fair shake is Cubase. It's been like (literally) since an Atari when I last opened it. Logic X is so sluggish it's crazy
@LaidbackLuke I wish Logic didn't feel like home. I'm looking all the time. Are you on a Mac or PC?
.@LaidbackLuke @DJMattHarvey Ableton is great I totally agree I just can't seem to wrap my head around it for film composition.

Loved St. Augustine Gospel Choir‚Äôs singing this morning for @Pontifex and reveled his message of love and tollerance #popefrancsis
And for my final shark statistic: more people die per year taking selfies than by shark attack. I think this case is now closed.
Today I printed an 8 bar click, reversed the phase and summed it with all the loops. Presto. Gone! #productiontricks
Made an insane discovery today. Last night I printed a bunch of percussion loops with the click on. I thought they were (obviously) unusable
It's stunning how an innovator like Bartok's influence can be heard years after his major works. Inspiring inspiring music.
Listening to Bartok music for Strings, Piano &amp; Celesta and reminded that there are such deep wells of unexplored harmonic material and form

@AveneMusic no the biggest killer are people (piles of imperial data to support this) and I don't know a single healthy vegan.
Just noticed my most important statistic didn't post. We kill 75 to 100 MILLION sharks a year. Wake up and spread the love for Sharks.
Want to help? Donate money to an organization that helps shark preservation like @SharkTrustUK. Most importantly, spread the right numbers
I invite any of you, to spend 50 minutes of your life on a dive w/a hundred reef sharks and tell me their beauty does not bring you to tears
As my favorite living creature, I hope we can all look at what we are doing to the shark population through more accurate optics.
Sharks are (arguably) the single most important part of our seas ecosystem. It is ignorant that we perseverate on shark attacks.
And most importantly, we kill 75-100 MILLION sharks a year. This is disgraceful. We should be ashamed.
Here's some facts for you. Snakes kill 100,000 people per year. (Brace yourself) mosquitoes kill 1 MILLION people a year.
First you can read this : sharks have killed 580 in recorded history (since 1580) here : https://t.co/FZViscrqr1
This morning some statistics. People have an unnatural, irrational fear of sharks. We kill these beautiful apex predators at a stunning rate
.@thebigern depends totally on the composition, composer and intent. This is something I myself do!
Yes @Bruce35dc if you could perceive an impulse train at 40,000 hertz as a rhythm, you'd notice a difference.
Have their own music that we are unable to understand. Forget language. Actual music.
Like the probability of a car crash making you a sandwich. It makes me think too I bet animals with different audio/visual refresh rates...
The intelligent design of music: tonality &amp; rhythm are the furthest thing from an accident possible.
#SaturdayDeepThoughts If our audio and visual cognitive refresh rate was higher or lower think about how different music would be!
Here's #PickleTheFox if you haven't seen my Instagram lately. It's mainly a fox and vintage synths. http://t.co/XfEJ5AnXTV
