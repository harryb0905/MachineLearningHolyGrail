Headed in to polish off another one for my next album. 🔥
@bt_uk @sarah_hilary A picture often says it best. Actual muppets. https://t.co/CyN2jgHxum
And there is justice in the world @KaceyMusgraves wins everything. Best Grammy’s in a while. What a killer night.
OMG @emilylazarlodge WE ARE SO INCREDIBLY PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!!!! Massive congratulations. I can’t think some something more overdue.
I LOVE the cover!!! Can’t wait for you guys to hear this. https://t.co/RjjD1TiNXp
Thanks so much Emily. Sounds about a million times better because of YOU. https://t.co/4SSKyjwWmq
I love this idea. Dream of mine is a multi-OS computer that you can cold boot into a single program (bypass the OS) so all the power of the machine is not bogged down by other apps or machine process. Kind of like an Avid but portable. I love this idea. https://t.co/RhjiFVMpaK
@Arcadiadiv @Alienware
Thanks so much Diana! Seeing people’s reaction to this today was very moving. Lots of really beautiful feedback. When we perform live this summer, maybe we’ll randomly do a song or two like this. https://t.co/F7FUlLKqMi
More where that came from!! https://t.co/Wc56euUImM
Thanks so much. I’ve always heard it’s not a great song unless you can strip it down to piano (or guitar) and voice. I agree :) https://t.co/mh2TkTTxwn
@AzorFrank Thanks so much Frank and these computers are absolutely stunning. The @intel folks helped upgrade these with Optanes and it’s absolutely to die for. Thanks again!
Btw not bashing @Spotify I think they’ve started to turn a corner to a more favorable model for artists. Like what they’re up to!
Easily the most powerful laptop I’ve ever owned. An actual masterpiece. https://t.co/3IRI2YXXkw
So happy you’re enjoying Spencer! https://t.co/X8vuagLTVw
I’m so excited to hit the studio today it’s like, scary. You guys are going to die the two colabs coming over the next 2 months. #studiotime
They’re coming soon!! https://t.co/rxrH2rtI3n
Thanks again LA. It was a blast. Little #LAkitchenrig I’ll miss you. Pumped to hit the studio tomorrow. Bye bud! https://t.co/eItpMzKnl9
Also @Spotify it’s a strategy. The people that use my name aren’t just trolling, they get a LOT of traction on some of their songs because they appear at the top of my feed. This should be blocked and these accounts should be shut. It’s disingenuous.
Yes it’s INCREDIBLE. Go vegan peppermint unsweetened marshmallows and coconut almond milk and you’re done. Crazy good. https://t.co/JinNqEONXT
Ik ik. Hey @Spotify how does this keep happening? I have a trademark on “BT” I’m a verified account. Uh and this is obviously not me. It’s a ton of work for us. My wife fixes 1-2 of these a week. https://t.co/6CtvLNjfKB
@misterfielding If you’ve got a record player, it’s all about the vinyl! If not I’d say CD.
Dear Chaga Mushroom coffee. I❤️you. Wow Chagachinos in LA, unsweetened, 40 calories, paleo, who can even? Headed east! Hopefully not to freeze. Bye for now LA!
Thanks so much Corne. It’s so exciting to listen to that album on vinyl it’s crazy. https://t.co/c4YI66hI2x

Thank you so much Terry. If you like this one, WOW will you be happy this year. That’s all I can say for now! https://t.co/Qsqt0lekLu
@SuminZhao @Ofcom It’s @bt_uk dude. Wow
That’s awesome. So proud of this one. Look forward to connecting with you guys on something else in the future. https://t.co/wSFjM420EB
🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/WHRHjuy9f5
Thanks for being there. Super enjoyed it. See you next time! https://t.co/7K0NLxqo3r
Headed today for a top secret, private, suuuuuper vintage synth jam. Magic will happen. I can feel it. Happy Monday!!
Thanks so much man. Honestly that’s one of my favorite records I’ve ever ever worked on. It’s an absolute gem. So excited to see people discovering it. https://t.co/c4YI66hI2x
Soundminer users, want to hear your experience!
@dergal @WilliamHarvey @Ammon_Johns @VodafoneUK Actually because you muppets are tweeting the wrong people rotfl
That thing is a piece of art. Just beautiful. Can’t wait put put it in one of my rigs. https://t.co/p4JpfbeXtt
@KjSawka @rob_swire I’m excited to check it out. We’re NAMM’d out. Going to the @pluginalliance thing later but now hiking the canyons!
Well first album of the year is already out and MUCH more to come. https://t.co/hkI8DLgkU5
Hi guys! Anyone here using @paulvirostek Soundminer with Logic Audio and Cubase? If yes tell me why I want it! Looks cool for sure. Would love to hear your experience.
Thanks for the fantastic time today. Especially to Doug and A3E, Andrei and the @intel crew and Brian @PCAudioLabs https://t.co/ucUIMQfKkK
So here’s my top 4 #namm2019 so far. The @WaldorfGmbH Quantum. You’re dead, best synth in years. You’re welcome. The @GamechangerA Plasma distortion and spectral freeze pedal (RUN to this booth if at NAMM) @Expressive_E Touche (AMAZING) and Black Corporation Synthex clone.
Fantastic @SpitfireAudio dinner went until all hours last night. Some super exciting projects with those boys this year! Great to see you @AlanMeyerson @JoeComposer and @MorrisTrevor super enjoyed our time together. See some of you guys at NAMM today!
Okay guys, my first SUPER legit discovery at @NAMMShow #NAMM2019 the @StudioBlackCorp Synthex clone. We used 3x Elka Synthex on the All Hail @thesilence album. It’s one of my fav synths ever. This clone is LE-GIT. Can’t wait to get this synth.
🎁 https://t.co/Ro8qK80SjN
@aortaproject I’m not a sample pack kinda guy
NAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMM
That kick drum (wow love this question) took me 6 hours to patch on the System 100. The coolest part is I used the actual gate signal (clipped on the console) for the clicky transient. I sampled it in the MP-60 https://t.co/VkixZKMFOX
@Mark_Reeder @thesilence The CD is 16/44.1 the best listen by a bajillion percent for the AHTS album is vinyl. It’s its intended listening format.
Thanks for listening Evan! https://t.co/miWrIHeBld
Who’s coming! SO excited for NAMM!!! https://t.co/Rb12LTYaCA
@Protector_99 No and I wouldn’t do that. There are things like vinyl noise (glitch and microrhythmic figures) that are time corrected to 2048th notes. Putting it on vinyl wouldn’t make it better it’s make it less accurate. For something like AHTS it’s a total win. Sounds warm and 80’s
There will only ever be one first listen! Excited to hear about yours :) https://t.co/hk7yicRYpH
🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/0vyojzZkqG
That sounds like an amazing first listen. I’m jealous actually. https://t.co/4lih1JrtEG

Cool right?! https://t.co/aCBQ5dTdwm
Really appreciate these kind words. The world is so crazy now, we need music as an immersive experience more than ever. ‡ is like a warm blanket. Thanks for getting it :) https://t.co/TwGQHCuZss
You know something that is an incredible feeling? That some kid is going to pick up the All Hail @thesilence album and listen to it until the file headers are corrupt. It will mean to him or her what records like Dream into Action or Speak and Spell mean to me. That is awesome.
I like this @Moogfest idea. Maybe we can do a runner with a Moog One. @howardjones, you’ll surely want in on this. Hehehe. https://t.co/nDo7CKsWS5
Love this one! THANK YOU @DailyListening for actively listening to our album, it’s exactly what we want you ALL to do! Stop everything, forget the world for 90 minutes, and get lost in some epic, heartfelt, nostalgic, great music. Great review Tina https://t.co/ehH4Iyon0L

Funny you should ask this. That’s what I wanted Electronic Opus to be but got (actually) bullied out of it. Sadly no, but maybe in the future. https://t.co/mzrb6nR3Qk
This Friday All Hail @thesilence debut album is out. Such an incredible journey. What a timeless album we have to share. I wish I could be with every single one of you this weekend listening. This is a true labor of love this album and one of the proudest moments of my life.

There has to be a balance between the head and the heart. Especially in music. Happy First Wednesday of 2019 :)
Have an emotional meaning and subtext that transcends any pretense we carry. The simpler, the better. A lullaby. The day music no longer moves me, I won’t be breathing.
This is not to say all of these academic persists, looking for new timbers, sounds and harmonic structures that convince, change and shatter is not a noble persuit. It is. My point is, harmony and structure and all the cliches we’ve developed...
And so all our pedantic line cliches, simple turns of phrase, I, Vi, IV, V”s etc etc when delivered authentically, reach inside our emotional core with remarkable, laser guided like accuracy.
Which is probably statistically true but there is more to it than that. The musical language we’ve developed over the last several thousand years is one with the profound ability to convey feeling states that are complex and hard to articulate.
For those not following the academic music community and their developments, since serialism, there’s a systemic belief that we explored all possible permutations of harmony and melody by about 1950.
I’ve been reading a new book by Curtis Roads that’s been blowing my mind. It’s the yang to this Kacey records ying.
The @KaceyMusgraves record is literally the “Thriller” of country music. I’ve not heard a more beautiful, well engineered, better song, stunning musicianship in years. A profound accomplishment.
Thanks for the 3&gt; Happy New Year! So glad you guys are enjoying this so much. It’s my favorite score I’ve done to date. https://t.co/MXC1IXzINF
First studio day of 2019. Here we go.
Dear GOD do I ever agree with you. And Midi clock to 2 outputs? All midi inputs merged? It’s like 1991 over there with Midi. Dk what to say :| https://t.co/2GNthsCqZM
Happy New Years to you all! May this be you’re best year yet.

Today finishing the new @thesilence original Christmas song. Will be a free download when ready. I’m thinking we’ll do it for an email address. Anyone know the best service for this? You guys will flip when you hear this. @christianburns_ dad wrote it. 🎄
@billybibregis @howardjones I love the mellotron. I don’t own one but have used a real one several times. The crazy thing about them is if you play a lot of notes the power consumption makes everything flat!
@Protector_99 @howardjones On the Fairlight it’s hand BX5’s. Front of room are massive ATC’s
@IanBlueprint You’re totally welcome. Keep your eyes peeled. I am going to do a BIG master class in 2019 and I’ll be discussing loads of my proprietary and home-grown techniques and methodologies!
Thanks for the kind words Ian! That was a super fun interview. He asked super insightful questions. https://t.co/5UclpIN8TC
@Protector_99 @howardjones *raises hand* Fairlight + Christmas tree = magic
@DjDebo They act as diffusion. They’re a part of the design.
@doughenders @howardjones You’re totally right mate. A PPG 2.3 and a Synthex. You’re right.
#winning that is all #winning https://t.co/IsUvsdqyes
Anyone built a Logic X script for translating midi CC to SysEx? I want to control the filter, res and filt env from mix position on a couple vintage synths. I know it can be done “fader learning” in environment but since I’m using External Instrument AU much easier with a script.
So excited about our looper conversation last week. Lots of cool stuff coming out of that twitter conversation!
@futurecopx hey man @thesilence loves your stuff. We’d love to have you on a remix of one of the upcoming singles.
You’re so welcome. Thanks for the ❤️. Back to you! https://t.co/GXXVyMbuaW
Can’t wait! https://t.co/nxN34Tym1u
Going live on my Facebook later today with @howardjones. What questions do you have for us?
@JBass43357453 Emailed you
@dillonbastan1 Hey! Thanks for your tweet. Follow me and pm coming :)
@dave_elton Amazing!
@SteveHelstrip Absolutely but not on live input capture.
Super appreciate that. I think that’d be the be-all-end-all looper. Somehow would need to run in DAW’s other that Love though too. https://t.co/Vi2YoFFneb
Oh forgot something super important. When you release a loop it needs to fade out over X duration. I can’t believe there’s not a looper that does this. If there is I can’t find it.
11. Spectral Freeze (so think Paul Stretch/Soundhack FFT spectral smear phase vocode type sound) That’s the list. I’ll make a full album with this one plugin. If it already exists, let me know! (There’s no - everything but this one thing. Need all this stuff!)
5. Tape noise/wow and flutter emulation (amount) 6. High pass filter 7. Low pass filter 8. Pitch offset (up or down 2x octaves) sample rate only so effects duration. 9. Loop course jitter (16th notes, think Amen break) 10. Loop fine jitter (playhead scrubbing)
Even better if any of you guys are MAX/MSP wizards would love to knock something up together. Would be great to have the following per-loop. 1. Crosfade amount (should go down to off-axis click). 2. Buffer start 3. Buffer end 4. Say 4x effect sends per-loop.
Happy Sunday all! Do any of my smart twitter followers know of a simple isorhythmic looper? Want something that holds 4x loops. Hardware or software. Work to clock but can have say 5/4 against 7/8 against 4/4. Loops must have their own output.

@FuriousEwok Rotfl. So true so true.
@MarcoPoloGarcia Cheers man you too!
@Darudevil @nickwax We’ve got a 2-3 strike policy on socials. Once someone says something rude a couple times, we block them. Personal policy. I keep socials positive.
@krissy314 To you and your squad too!
I have a bomb recipe. Will share after the holidays. https://t.co/N4oeez0xg3
Hey @RedChilliesEnt trying to get some clarity on what’s going on. Can you enlighten us?
You know how I know it’s a barn burner of a Paleo/Whole 30 Thanksgiving at the Transeau’s? I just cleaned almond and coconut flower off the ceiling. Real life. The ceiling.  2x pumpkin coconut pies and a homemade apple pie done!
Thanks so much. Was a total honor. https://t.co/VvixkEZfR7
So many classics for @DreamstateUSA it hurts. In a GREAT way :) https://t.co/LLaCWEKAZR

Thinking of picking up that @uad 480 too. My fav reverb ever is my hardware 224. Anyone got the UAD 480?
Speaking of which if you’ve got vintage samplers and don’t have @chickensystem translator, wow 75$ I may pick up a backup copy! https://t.co/pqgrmJj2Gw

Something I love about Twitter is being able to connect with musicians not in your “circle” (@dcfc) What started out as a convo about synths
Super excited to share my rework of @dcfc’s song Northern Lights!  ✨You can listen to it here https://t.co/S3rWwNBeou✨

@pixlr__ @Lazz_R @NickChicane @ADE_NL How that could equal ghost production boggles the mind because I wrote it lol but that’s the whole story. His mix is lovely too.
@pixlr__ @Lazz_R @NickChicane @ADE_NL Absolutely! I have in past already. Simply he did a beautiful mix of Flaming June I never heard until recently and the intro to my version on Electronic Opus is nearly identical. I’ve played it on piano like that live since AI wrote it.
@Lazz_R @pixlr__ @NickChicane @ADE_NL Seriously? Feel really bad for him honestly. Never seen someone with more influence treat so many people with so little kindness. In comparison he’s actually been nice to me. It’s total bs.
❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/v3BvpS05Jh

Now off to Paris to kick off our anniversary trip. Excited for a couple days of R&amp;R after @ADE_NL great times.

The amazing moment when you do something you’re so proud of it’s crazy and the folks that receive it freak out as hard as you do. The feeling of a peer saying “you’re effing great” is one of the best things a musician receives about their work. #paythatforward #kindwordsarefree
@ansa2music @iZotopeInc I love hearing that. Thanks for the love!

Congrats to all my @RecordingAcad and Naras friends who worked so hard to help pass the Music Modernization act. Today is historic for musicians. It will really change many of our lives significantly. Amazing news.
@ryanlanciaux Weill let you keep that one but if you have a Prophet 5 rev2 with factory midi we’re taking it lol.
@mattfaxmusic Hahahahahahaha for sure.
PUT YOUR HAND UP AND GIVE US ALL YOUR SYNTHESIZERS. https://t.co/A4i1SFM9EP
YESSSS!!! New music from the incredible @mattfaxmusic and I tomorrow called “The Noetic”. I’ve been playing this out, it’s a MONSTER. (side note: Matt in these pictures we look like jewel thieves. If we were in a band we’d have to have some Oceans 11 reference or something 😂) https://t.co/A4i1SFM9EP
I listened to @chancetherapper on @JoeBudden podcast via @Spotify and was really impressed with who you are as a person and what you stand for and have contributed to the community. Kudos dude, music needs more people walking the walk. Ps Joe your podcast is dope love it.
Have you guys checked out the @jodywisternoff remix video for All Hail @thesilence “Diamonds in the Snow” You’re gonna love it. Here : https://t.co/vqzkvqgTlU

@Darudevil @DJOrkidea @Peppepappa @PessiLevanto @MiscManagement Way to go team this is stunningly beautiful. Arrangement was wonderful I loved it. Particularly liked the ostinato on Marimba mimicking my acid lines!! Fantastic work :)))
I’d love to help in any way I can. It was beautiful. I’ll come play piano on Flaming June. Invite me! (Great to heat from you too brother :) https://t.co/PLDaiQCZZm

This really changed that for me pretty radically. She is humble and likable, gifted and measured. Her acting performance is as wonderful as her singing (really saying something) and Bradley Cooper is incredible. This is an absolute must see film. Absolutely loved every second.
I’m a huge Bradley Cooper fan. Loved most all of his films. Never though twice about Gaga honestly. She’s obviously incredibly talented singer but the songs and image have always seemed like a modern approximation of the 80-90’s Madonna shock and awe. Just kinda not “my tribe”.
It’s a great reminder that audiences still crave an authentic musical experience, commentary to the human condition and can live without Oreos and 2 minute songs (couldn’t resist). It’s absolutely fantastic.
Okay so got that out of the way. So thread hijack and great news. We watched A Star is Born last night and literally wept for 2 and a half hours. This movie is wonderful. Spoiler, it’s going to win everything.
Why not do this with music? I’ll let you come to your own ideas about this. Of course music is one of the most profound cross cultural catalyst for communicating the human condition and experience. Call me a luddite and an optimist.
Oreos are a great example I’ve previously mentioned. They’re designed to be addictive like drugs. The fat/salt/sugar balance perfectly stimulates the pleasure center of the brain. Many fast foods are the same and worse.
We are in the process of “optimizing” (boy it’s hard to write that even in quotes) music like we are “optimizing food.
You oversimplify to the point of kindergarten. Start a song on the down beat of a chorus! Of course!! Everyone is going to fast forward anyway. Outro? No way! People are going to jump to the next track on their playlist. Make it 2 minutes long!
I’m not being chased by any  dinosaurs (don’t know about you guys) so I prefer my pre-frontal cortex not my reptile brain but I digress. This is the world we’ve made. Overstimulated, saturated w/choice, lightening fast turnover rate so how do you get media through in that system?
Streaming has sent music into a creative and existential tailspin where (real marketing term) “snackable” media for a culture overstimulated and constantly subjugated to social stimulation that keeps us in “limbic resonance” is just what’s happening to get used to it.
This article makes me want to jump off something. Firstly it’s written very well and very accurate (so no offense intended to the author at all). Some of the most depressing highlights are things like 13 song albums with 104 writers. Real life.
I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news. Let’s start by getting the bad news out of the way. Anyone (fan or musician) who wants to understand why music has changed and is continuing to change. Read this. https://t.co/L0g3n8YKuu

Excited to see a bunch of you have been checking out my new Bowed guitars collection at https://t.co/JjzhXcRuZk love to hear what you’re doing with them! https://t.co/5cn948uPYx
So this is a salute to you my fellow artists, dreamers, thinkers and doers. Your courage inspires me. I acknowledge and validate your courage and your struggle. Profoundly. I too love it. The world is a better place because of this courage.
An innate gift and often a variety of types of trauma. What courage artists have!
Additionally as an adjunct thought, it makes a lot sense why so many artists suffer from a pleathora of mental health conditions. Add to that that many with a proclivity for the arts arrive there often by...
The palpable irony that artists are like a living, walking, raw nerve is not lost on me! It’s an extraordinary person that keeps themselves open to sense and subtext, emotion and feeling: the weight of the human condition and receives criticism and rejection as a frequent reward!
A life in the arts means a life of criticism and rejection. In fact, the more profound your work or discoveries, the less people will embrace them in their moment of creation. It’s not until the are  commodified they make sense to many.
When I was in Nashville, I met with someone who was famous for NOT signing Taylor Swift! That’s a weird thing to be famous for but I digress.
That’s a pretty profound realization. Rejection breaks many people. There are some wonderful books about pioneers (not just artists) and how many people snubbed their work. Often right before a massive breakthrough.
Being a (we’ll call it) working artist means you are a seasoned professional at being rejected. One of the only common thru-lines of artists (successful or otherwise) is a life of rejection. You have to be better at accepting rejection than making art!
Having a wonderful conversation with my wife this morning about the path of a working/functioning/actualized artist. We realized some pretty profound things that warrant sharing.
@josephjo it’s not me. It’s an error on Spotify’s part.
You guys got a fav ID3 tagging software for Mac? Share! Need to clean up some old MP3’s.
@buzzinlikeneon Comment was should you like it? Also noting this is not in the collective consciousness that this is possible much less happening. You do you though 😂.
Beautiful rainy Sunday. Enjoying so much not being on a flight somewhere. Happy Sunday.
One of my best studio days in years. Wow beast mode ENGAGED. It’s the weekend! Whoot! Taking tomorrow off. Have a great safe Friday night y’all!
@pokadottricks I’ve done this many times check old posts. Anything I do like this is time I’m not writing. I gotta always remind myself of that.
@Cory_Henry Dude PM me!
@azimari @Cory_Henry Mind is literally blown. Tastiest playing I’ve heard in years.
@BTfan4life @GANEMYDE I’d love to find out who made that. It’s really beautiful.
This is almost fixed. Big guffule with @cdbaby nearly sorted. Not gonna lie, they’ve been tough to work with hunh @TommyTallarico ! 😂 https://t.co/iX5GZAPCjT
And based on happenstance would be preposterous. My profile based on what I follow is all music so an eye mask, Japan and a vacuum don’t fit my profile. If you think your phone isn’t listening to your every word, news flash!
Show of hands, how many of you have had that look of terror when Instagram pulls up adds from a key word out of a private conversation you were having with your phone in your pocket. Has happened to me 7 times (yes I’ve counted)
@BTfan4life @GANEMYDE Lance I love this image. Where is that from?
Just spent a good 40 min watching this absolute MONSTER player on YouTube. @Cory_Henry you’ve quite literally blown my mind. Would love to have you play on a track or connect on some music. You all have to hear this guy. Just wow.
Love bass and 217 bars of drum fills. Yep it’s a “live” kinda day. #studiosaturdays
@LeeAston1 A couple hundred on each.
Did I just finish TWO songs for my next album in one day? YES. There’s an absolute first. Analog Synth mode engaged, it’s gonna be 150 degrees in the studio today!
@MAIMOONAHzahid @MalikRiaz_ @BTKUpdates Do you have access to a flame thrower?
@Nikolozi Plugins and cleaning up some frameworks
Alright studio, it’s your turn. Let’s do this. I sometimes feel like I’m cheating on the studio with Xcode.
Think you guys will SUPER enjoy these sounds. See what I did there? https://t.co/JjzhXcRuZk sounds? https://t.co/Z4Sj7jmnaz
@chrisgeary Yes done plenty in the analog domain. Did it the same way, record and bounce to stereo. Rinse repeat. Somewhere there’s some 499’s holding hundreds of tracks on a single 24 track from when I was a teenager.
@brightlightx2 Me and the misses have been bumping your tunes at breakfast. Really like what you’re doing and your voice is fantastic.
@pokadottricks It’s pretty equally balanced honestly. I write in sections so each section may happen only once or twice and will be comprised of approx 80-100 tracks (after folding down)
@terrydunlin Sounds lovely. Great idea actually. On it.
384 tracks down to 32 stems. This is BIG progress. Tomorrow this ones in the bag. 🔥
@brightlightx2 Thanks again man. Look forward to checking out your music. You’ll be me tomorrow morning Spotify listen!
It’s crazy how deep in the stem wormhole I am right now. Like CRAY-Z.
@pokadottricks They’re packed. Not sure I understand the question.
@brightlightx2 Thanks for the kind words. That’s all done by hand. Lots done in vintage (now) samplers.
And this new album track weighing in at 384 tracks. It’s stem day. Yes it tis’! #HappyMonday
My pleasure. The short drone films are a think to behold too. It really was made to be enjoyed in this form not streamed. :) https://t.co/hp1eyL9MBI

@reinhs I’ve literally crossed it twice in 4 songs. Next album is going to be completely out of control.
That epic moment when you write a beautiful brass corral for the second breakdown in a piece of dance music. This next album of mine is easily going to be my best yet. #ThursdayThoughts
@MrCarefulGamer @howardjones My favs are all Kontakt instruments now. I still love Pianoteq as well which is stunning.
@TavitsPhotos It was written in movements. It is a single composition on the 4K USB drive available from @BlackHoleRec
@bradjerkins @NI_News @Junkie_XL How many thread/core machine and what type SSD’s?
Saturday morning autoload mayhem. Back on the horse. Got a big project coming up and 700 instruments to add. #studiosaturdays
Any big autoload/hardcore @NI_News  Kontakt users on here have pre-load settings lower than 60k? Film fam, I’m looking at you! @Junkie_XL what are you set to?
@adomus07 I use a bajillion button @Logitech gaming mouse and I love it.
This is kind of a daily thing with Spotify. Their vetting game is pretty weak. Seems they need their algorithms tweaked. https://t.co/CqNM3gKKjY

@AxuTee That’s a hard one. My first memory of this was Debussy The Sunken Cathedral. It’s like a painting. It effected me like visual art.
My bud @BlakeLewis killing it. https://t.co/7g5IAKdMsy Sweet!
Facebook love today. Got questions? I’m excited to answer them. Post them here and I’ll get to some of these too. FB scrolls questions at light speed!
@MrJoeRMusic @TranceEmerson I don’t agree. It’s absolutely a choice. The one that kills me is when people say it’s more expensive. It’s WAY less expensive to meal prep but involves a lot of time and effort. There’s a million reasons you and anyone else can do this. It’s a choice, and I respect yours.
@SmilingSimile Agree to completely disagree https://t.co/h4K0924nBx

@ariedana I love the honestly. May I ask why?
@nicfranc Soon soon soon!!
@BrianRose1987 Meat, vegetables, fruits in moderation and nuts. And piles of water.
@iamthejw1 It will actually change your life. Can’t be overstated. Push through first 10 days. Most people quit then. You can thank me in 30....or 300!
To many studies linking sugar to depression to even tweet about. If there’s 2x people cut out is sugar and gluten. https://t.co/Bzhe7ASeCv
@Chicaned_UK I’m not saying eating can’t be pleasurable. It absolutely can be (hopefully is!), it’s just not it’s purpose. It’s purpose is to nourish your body and brain.
The worst/best part about Whole 30/Paleo is this : if you do it, any time you eat something bad for your body and brain you’ll know what it feels like if you’re not doing that. It basically can’t be “unseen”. Happy Monday to you all :)
If anyone reading this stops eating the following for a month and doesn’t feel like a new person, I’ll eat my shoes. Added sugar, alcohol, gluten, grains, any processed food, dairy, soy (estrogen booster in men), legumes. Try it. I swear to God it’ll change your life.
The craziest part is YOU HAVE A CHOICE. So if you’re walking around feeling sad, overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, unmotivated, lost, confused pick up some spinach and farm raised beef or have some free range salmon and cauliflower rice.
Further there’s mountains of empirical scientific research linking food to mental illness, mood disorders and a million other things that aren’t heart disease and the ones you commonly think of.
And you are ingesting the world through your mouth (weird but true thought). You are actually assimilating the world through your mouth. Do you want to be polluting your body and brain with things toyed with in a laboratory?
Food is not for pleasure. All these engineered foods where they play around with salt to fat to sugar relationships to make them actually addictive (like Oreos) are poison. We are actually poisoning ourselves daily.
I’ve not really mentioned it but we never stopped Whole 30. I’ve never felt better in my entire life, like ever. It’s really changed the way I feel about food and about self control.
Thanks for all the timeblock info guys. Super helpful stuff. Anything else you’ve got to share I’m listening.
Anyone here do timeblocking? If you’re an expert I’m interested. Would love to hear what works for those of you that do this. Happy Friday!
Nashville to @NewOrder tonight! Wheut?! Wish we were seeing New Order in Nashville but will settle for just New Order. My fav band of all time. I can’t wait.
Sitting in a wicker rocking chair, barefoot, feet in the grass, doing some Sunday morning sound design in Nashville. Too much winning in one tweet. Here’s me and the misses last night watching T.Swizzle take no prisoners. Epic. Happy Sunday! https://t.co/PNQ1HqHAvl
Road trip Ashville to Nashville! Have I mentioned how much I love this place? I’m pretty sure this is my favorite city in America and (one day soon I hope) would love to live here. ❤️ Nashville. Happy Sat!
@Evan_Arnett @MykoVu It won’t prevent it, there just will not be the need for it so the study of it will cease. Look at the upside, imagine the new forms of music and art we’ve yet to imagine that neural networks will make not for our pleasure, but for theIr own.
@cahorton I’m working on something that led me to this timeframe.
Art, music and literature will all be coterminous. Multidisciplinary arts like film and VR media will be secondary. https://t.co/2nukGdSdT6
@mccrory Kinda and kinda not. I can’t think about 30,000 variables and do a comparative real time analysis can any of us? 100 minds to make a film? Amazon S3 could do it with the right algorithms in seconds.
@barreraluisfe Who’s complaining? I’m making a footnote. I’m both excited and frightened as we should probably all should be. In our lifetime we will witness the birth of what could easily be argued is a new species.
@freddysheinfeld Provoking a deeply meaningful and emotional response, date I say transcendent or religious can be quantified, studied and recreated.
@freddysheinfeld And the amount of biometric information we are already collecting is astonishing. Your pulse? How fast you walk? How active you are...data. Your phone or Apple Watch collect them. Retinal tracking on web sites studying what you look at and for how long. Data.
@freddysheinfeld Sadly incorrect. Our preferences (both personal &amp; as societal groups) can also be quantified easily to a very large “big data” set. The connection you are taking about is just a complex set of information based on where you grew up, your life experience, your likes and dislikes
@MykoVu Sort of. I’m saying we are in the last generations of creators right now.
@iBluestone Distilling trance to an algorithm is actually frighteningly easy. Google Magenta starred with Bach. Have you heard it? Your jaw will drop.
@Metamorphisnt Like they have something to say for the model for monetization of music shifting from 85cents net a song to .00038 cents a stream? What I just wrote is already in progress under everyone’s nose.
@iamthejw1 Humans will be curators not creators. We are nearly there actually this isn’t a big leap.
And every artistic work ever created will be quantified in a way a humans mind can’t think (ie multidimensional data sets) and turned into algorithms that can be, curated, breed and grown. The next generation of famous artists will be algorithms.
Inside 10 to 15 years, artificial intelligence will be able to do anything creative a human being can do, in many cases, significantly better. They won’t have to sleep either and will be able to create with Quantum computing near the speed of light.

@PhilWhiteBooks I’ve written a 200+ page thesis for it (and an even longer treatment). Just need to allocate the resources (time and money). I’ve also already sketched a lot of the music.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/xo9Qf1DctV
❤️🔥 https://t.co/TgLMD8sCgA
@jcbenitez19 It will promise. Coming soon.
@soundanswer Erik thanks so much for your reply. I’ve got a stable OS9 rig. This is a OSX rig with at least Protools 7 and Logic 7 to load some This Binary Universe sessions. Thanks so much for the thoughtful response though.
I love this idea actually (will leave you with this) similar idea to negative space in art....it’s often more powerful and/or fruitful to define yourself, relationally, your work etc by what you aren’t. Shines a very different light 💡
Anyway, I’m pretty sure @avid should pay therapy costs for life lol. It’s amazing sometimes what is possible “in-spite of” not because of.
I finished Emotional Technology on it, This Binary Universe, my Stealth and Monster Scores and countless TV/remixes etc. I don’t know how, but walked through that fire for about 5 solid years.
And picked up the whole thing (like 150 lbs for real) and went to throw it off the balcony of my house rotfl. The guys that worked at my place at the time (Mike D love you looking at you) talked me out of it. That’s how much I loathed that system.
The DTDM/DAE/Core audio this was a distaster. True story : When I was writing This Binary Universe, one day (I made a note 144 crashes) I calmly took apart my HD rig, interfaces and computer (keep reading this is funny...)
From about 2005-2010 is the craziest period in computers and DAW’s there ever was. Apple and @Avid lied to people for about 5-7 straight years about Protools and Logic compatibility. I posed a challenge in Keyboard to anyone with a working system I’d buy it. Not one response lol.
I’m going to rebuild my This Binary Universe rig but hope it won’t crash (literally real life) every 10 minutes. It’s amazing how much music I’ve made that for all intents Ana purposes, shouldn’t exist.
So I posed this question about 12+ years ago. No one has ever answered so I’ll repeat myself lol. Anyone got a mid 2000 Logic TDM system that works? If yes please all the details, versions of Logic, Protools, OS and all hardware.
Those are fighting words for @lacyinwonderlnd one of her fav records ever. I appreciate the vote of confidence Dave 👍🏻 I know we could make something really special. I think the Death Cab stuff is some of the best modern lyrics and songs ever. The lyrics are insanely good. https://t.co/BCaU85GaWA

@dcfc that’s so cool about the fairlight and look forward to hearing the album. Sorry not sorry, but Stewart sent me the monitor for
@dcfc that’s amazing! I love what you guys do, my wife @lacyinwonderlnd is one of your biggest fans and turned me on to you guys music.
The new @dcfc is phenomenal. Wonderful, thoughtfully recorded, great songs. Can’t wait to hear the whole album. I’ve heard a rumor there is some Fairlight IIx on there. Excited to read interviews about that!
@MrDisco3 @SciTechMuseum Adore all Bob Moogs pioneering work. Especially the MiniMoog Model D and the MemoryMoog. Two of my favorites. I use them daily.
Getting my head down and making some beauty now in the studio. To some of my closest friends I’ve been sub-tweeting today. Want you guys here in 20 years. Happy Monday to you all.
@davedresden With you Dave. Crazy thing is if you do have a 100 million Spotify plays you also have 5-10 reps (manager, attorney, agents, business manager) eating 50% off the top, then you have to pay expenses. Wait THEN you pay tax on the gross.
I’ll end this by saying, (especially to my friends that are compulsively working and making other people wealthy). Stop, look what you’ve accomplished, let that be enough. Spend some time with your families and friends. Get back to what you love, making music only to make music.
Business folks get rich, the artists do 20+ jobs, shorten their life spans with unreasonable expectations, travel, shows etc. If you look at any huge DJ or dance music artist to do all of what they’re doing, they’re destroying their hearing, not sleeping and wrecking their body.
This model is unsustainable. The saddest part is the wake up calls if there are any will be important artists dying.
To make dance music now you are 1. Artist 2. Producer 3. Engineer 4. Mastering engineer 5. Marketing and social media maven 6. Tour manager 7. At the very least an adjunct to press...I can keep going here.
Wait you’re also responsible to engage your social media to promote a show because now promoters don’t for the most part even do that.
Now something like that is actually unimaginable. Albums are all but non-existent. Turn over rate for a single is 1-2 weeks. Do you mix your own records? Of course you do. You probably master them too (insane!) and somehow you tour 120-200 nights a year?
I was the only artist I (personally) knew at that time that mixed their own records. Many people had both a “producer” and and “engineer”. I performed both those roles for many artists through my entire career to date. My point being, that was more than one person.
When I first started making dance music, before there were idiom specific names (hence getting the moniker Trance named after my early works, supposedly from my last name) it was considered extraordinary to mix your own music. Like extraordinary.
Electronic music and now the business that has sprung up around it the last 10 years has set such extraordinarily unrealistic expectations on the people that make it.
I have some close friends (obviously no names will be mentioned) that I look at their tour schedules and can actually say I’m not just concerned about their health but about how long they will live.

Our friend @davidcookmusic is @taylorswift13 synth wizard and @lacyinwonderlnd went to the new show. It’s like, literally a Vegas show in scope and spectacle and the album is WOW. In fact I’ve got a NC show before their Nashville gig and I’m pretty sure we’re coming
Who was I sleeping on the new @taylorswift13 record? Have you guys heard this? It’s incredible. I am slightly biased as it’s rife with @iZotopeInc #Breaktweaker but WOW is this incredible.

@bmkibler You literally, actually, have to read this book. It’s the main theme what you just wrote.
And quick spoiler, he surmises the “meaning” is changing, person specific and temporal (my words not his). So the answer to this question is really a question. What is life asking of me (that only I can be and/or do), right now, in this moment. 💡

As a final thought, those of you (maybe like me) that think you don’t like country music, your missing one of the greatest things this life has to offer. Literally like, scuba diving, a perfect glass of red wine, holding the hand of the person you choose to love. It’s that good.
And if that makes me a Luddite or common or regressive then so be it. The beauty of artist (imho) comes from the “time put in”. Truly knowing your craft so you can fully express. Absolutely love it.
“Hey whatever happened to, Waitin' your turn Doing it all by hand, 'Cause when everything is handed to you It's all only worth as much as the time you put in In all just seems so good the way we had it Back before everything became, automatic”
Before that we listened to @mirandalambert “Automatc” which has literally my life motto in the lyrics. If I was the tattooing type this would be somewhere on my body.
Listening to one of my all time favorite (modern) artists @zacbrownband “Goodbye in Her Eyes”. I mean if you write one song this good in your life, you did it in my opinion. Pure, humble, direct, authentic beauty. Moves me so hard I can’t express.

I’ve got a solution that will surprise you. Absynth. 9 octave bendrange with Lag control to smooth controller messages. Unreal. Works a dream. Patch made. Thanks for the help guys and hope this helps someone else!
@JRokujuushi Thanks for the ideas. They’re all great. Pretty sure I’m going to have to make this. The irony of ironies is that something like Kurzweil V.A.S.T can easily do this (9 octaves super smooth) I just need something in the box.
@JRokujuushi Totally. Again this is a great idea. Need access to this on Mac (windows too) but primarily Mac.
@Jamie_Myerson It will stair-step/quantize/zipper noise. Needs to be super high resolution/smooth portmanteau over 6 octaves.
@MrCarefulGamer Oh this is literally my whole life needing things like this. It’s why I started a software company!
@HarbourEDM All those but Falcon have a 2-3 octave bend range. Most importantly I need it to smooth the bend curve so it doesn’t sound quantized. Other ideas?
@JRokujuushi This totally works yes. Even though about this as a solution. I need it as a VST or AU that can run in all my DAW’s
@Jamie_Myerson No 2 octave bend range
More looking for a 1. Does not exist 2. _______ instrument. If I need to make it, I can. Hoping it exists though.
Hey tweeples, okay looking for suggestions. I need a VST/AU that can 1. Make a sine wave 2. Bend said sine wave 6 octaves (not mono glide I need precise control of duration) must smoothly interpolates (like mono-glide) the bend info. Suggestions por favor!
@templeguiting Because you’re tweeting the wrong people. I know, life is complex.

@hbrooks I couldn’t agree more. It’s earth shaking profound stuff. It can’t be unread either.
@bmkibler It’s pretty unbelievable the perspective of what we are capable of in-spite of tremendous suffering. And suffering of course being one of the most fundamental and persistent facets of the human condition. This should be mandatory reading for everyone.
Read this last night in Man’s Search for Meaning “They may have been few in number but offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose ones own way”
Had a fantastic time. Can’t wait to do it with you guys again ❤️ https://t.co/v65K7Xe8S6
It’s crazy. For 20 years I’ve had two jobs. The week in the studio and the weekend on planes. After taking a short break, you sure do feel 2x shows and 6 flights! Looking at my computer right now like 😳

Hello LA. Where the heck is the nearest coffee bean. My parents really want it. Sincerely, Scout https://t.co/xQb99udQ6m
@djtt88 Do you know why? Same reason people perceive buss compression as “good” it mimics what your ears do when they can’t take in any more amplitude. They sidechain to sub information because those waveforms are physically longer.
@SteveHelstrip You’re probably right. Saddens me a lot actually. The difference between a service like LNDR (which is great for rough score cues for example) and a human being like Emily Lazar with 30 years of study, artistry and life experience is like a squashed egg and a  Ferrari.
@djtt88 Love this perspective. I honestly think a lot of music from a technical perspective sounds terrible from the ninety’s. The converters, aliasing, I could go on and on. 70’s and 80’s all the hardware gave so much love to the sound. As we switched in the box the transition was ERK!
I’m starting to think there’s a plugin idea in this thread. We need a way to utilize this “bus compression” as a technique that is intermittent not omnipresent. Also across stems. Nothing can do this. A kind of polyphonic compression if you will.
@Scott_SKG Absolutely true. The point being a bunch of triadic, no voice leading, MOR, Sylenth parts over a Vengeance kick drum sounds like the skies parting. It’s not Rachmaninov know what I’m sayin?
@aortaproject @masterclass Yes I am thinking about doing something like this.
Certainly when I’m writing music for a film something like this would never fly. It’s all about subtly, shape, space and tremendous dynamics. Master bus compression forgives way too many wrongs. The Instagram filter of music! Would love to hear your thoughts.
But used the way it is, it’s completely removed any sense of dynamics from modern electronic music. Surely there’s a middle ground here. I’m thinking of making stems in all my DAW autoloads to utilize this as a technique not the end all be all.
Not that it’s a horrible thing either master buss compression, it’s just an observation. It has become the “sound” of now. It’s I’d say about 50% of why modern electronic music sounds so “big” even with such simple parts. For what’s now called a “drop” it can be fantastic.
There are hundreds of well known electronic artists that if you mute their master bus compression, the record sounds like a poorly produced, pedantic demo.
Long interesting conversation with @lacyinwonderlnd on our airport drive this morning about master bus compression. It’s like an Instagram filter for music (her observation). It’s crazy how true that is.

“who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions...
A new fav quote “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood”
Hey @Izludetingel and @Arcadiadiv thank you both for talking to me tonight. I really appreciate both your candor and honesty. John I’m sorry Alex treated you the way he did. Mark, I’m sorry you didn’t get to see the show. I hope I can make it up to you both. Thanks for listening.
@Arcadiadiv great send me your number
@Arcadiadiv if there’s something I can help you with, great. If not, how can I help you move on? Either way feel free to DM me your number.
@Arcadiadiv I no longer work with Alex. Not sure why trying to drag me through the mud helps you get an apology from him.
@Arcadiadiv hey John. We’re trying to DM you. Is there something you didn’t get? Kindly DM your number so we can resolve it if there is something.
@Izludetingel I just posted the true story. Send a number. Happy to call, you’ve got an opportunity to resolve this and you’re choosing to be angry. I wish I could fix that for you but I can’t.
@Izludetingel Wouldn’t it feel better to you to talk about this? I can’t fix what Tanz did. I’m happy to Skype but you’ve denied this and I can’t make a party (was Tanz responsibility). Man, do you want to be mad or talk about it? Will call you right now just need a number.
@Izludetingel Can you kindly answer the question Mark? What do you not have?
@Izludetingel we are in contact with him over email and lacy is planning time with him.
@Izludetingel I’m asking YOU. What do you not have?
@jslydemusic And we haven’t been silent. The guy that started that thread was missing two signatures on a score. He sent it to us, we got them and sent it back. He’s just an angry guy it seems. We’ve given him and everyone we can find what they’re promised.
@jslydemusic Hopefully you’ll read my post. I’m so proud of that project and grateful to the people that contributed. We spent every penny on making the album and show (in fact it was matched by investors) we spent 2x the Kickstarter.
Love hearing this. Thanks Dustin. https://t.co/73m6LslOU9
@Izludetingel is there something you’ve not gotten? If yes what? Here’s your chance please share with the group. We really went out of our way to accommodate you.
That’s crazy. Not only do I not have a copy of that myself I’ve actually never seen it! https://t.co/zPCnUsePcx
@jslydemusic Hey that saddens me to hear. Yes I do actually. I’m about to post the entire story. If you’re interested in the truth and not a bunch of hyperbole and speculation my post will be up shortly. All my best to you.
@WolfkinMusic I never got any! Do you have some? Please send if yes.

@RFradman Will look out for that one. Mans Search for Meaning kept me up last night. It’s a heavy one but absolutely incredible.
@tsmays Absolutely. The Tanz Group and @TommyTallarico committed me to things that were impossible to live up too and then washed their hands of it.  I really don’t understand what that small group of people is upset about I wish I did. Overall it was an extraordinary experience.
@RFradman Reading Man’s Search for Meaning
@kaskade @theversusverses I read someone say something great the other day basically, there are not two of you. If your a bully or unkind or cruel or whatever online, that’s what you are. There’s only one you.
@kaskade @theversusverses Hey Ryan hope you’re well. I block people that are rude. The world needs more kindness so I support those that give it. I’m afraid I’ll have to say no.  I find it amazing that people can act in certain ways online and expect a pass when called out.
“He who has a WHY to live can beat almost any HOW”. Take that one on. While I’m sitting programming and finishing music today that’s what I’ll have rolling around in my head. Happy Tuesday.
If I could make one life recommendation to everyone, it’d be don’t check your phone the first hour of your day and spend that time reading.  This morning I began a new book and in the first 5 lines was this line...
Excited to let you guys know a collaboration I did with @guiborattomusic is coming out soon on his new album, set to release June 15
I wholeheartedly agree. https://t.co/DqGFHsqp6e
Prayers for his friends and family. It really hit me how profoundly sad it is to loose someone just getting started. If you’re an artist you should read this. There is blood on these people’s hands. https://t.co/YtTOmeCvJV
I’ll leave you with this. Unlike many others that have said something incredibly disingenuous about @Avicii I wasn’t a fan of his music but I did respect his contribution and think he was very talented and deserved better from the people around him that palpably failed him.
So, when you do find people that are altruistic, and get it (you the artist) and are willing to roll their sleeves up and get in the trenches with you. Man, celebrate that and tell people about these people so we can all exemplify and celebrate them. They are extremely rare.
It is VERY uncommon for attorneys, managers, agents, business managers, lawyers (I put them twice because they’re usually the most nefarious) to have any semblance of concern for an artists well being, emotionally, physically, spiritually, relationally or in any other capacity.
I’d like to think these days, I’ve surrounded myself with them. I’m one of the lucky ones. The point of this lengthy diatribe is this : if you’re a young artist or have dreams of a life in the arts....know this.
There are the rare few people in the music business that treat artists and their expression with sincerity and reverence for the emotional and relational costs associated with producing valuable and meaningful artists works.
I once had a manager that said “If I could just clone you 2x I could retire and let you do all the work”. He was 3 drinks in when he said this out loud but I knew it was how he felt from the beginning. Artists to most in business are a commodity.
Many (myself at times) are represented by people who are thinking 0% about artistic integrity and expression and 100% about how to (watch use of language here) manipulate an artist into a situation they can monetize.
In thinking about it, something I’ve discussed privately with my friends and family for years is the people that surround artists. Many artistic people are actually very shy and or introverted.
I actually put Twitter back on my phone to share this and talk about it. Firstly really saddened by @Avicii passing. What a tragedy it is for a life to be cut so short.

@Franck_Alcidi And further, I’ve been playing Flaming June intro like this since 1997 live, if anything, he copied me. And again, I wrote the song.
@Franck_Alcidi This just isn’t true and disparages the beautiful piece of music I wrote. These notes came out of my head in 1997. The end.
@shoeab_ all of the music you hear in the movie is done by me
It’s being released in November. Can’t wait to share the music with you all
It’s really exciting for me because I’ve been told it’s the first time an American composer has scored an Bollywood film
You will be able to hear it soon &amp; even sooner if you are in India.   I am scoring my first Bollywood film, it’s a thriller called Ittefaq!
It’s because I’ve been writing some of the best music I’ve ever written in my life.   And here’s something really cool about it
You might be wondering why I’ve been so quiet lately…
Thanks for the birthday wishes 😊

Which, was an unexpected gesture and I appreciated it. I hope he speaks with staff at @united and they follow through with staff traning
An update on yesterday’s @united fiasco. Head of customer service met me at our plane once landed at Dulles to talk about entire situation
@Sunda amazing as usual! It’s always our first stop when we get into Chicago.   The great white = favorite thing ever
In case you were wondering how it all panned out https://t.co/caMfNUCncs
You can’t run a business like that. That’s what happened to a business like TWA
I mean look at what @united did when they beat that doctors face in. They denied it for a full 24 hours. Made him the bad guy.
@tarunshama2105 @united I’m not sure if they can survive honestly. They’d have to do such an about face it’s unbelievable.
Just got a text from @united saying flight is departing at 3:00. Highly doubtful since it’s 2:59 and half the plane is empty. Good work guys
Did @delta status match you when you left @united ? https://t.co/hNiZ30mJwK
Seriously, like is Google Magenta the new AI for @united? I get it’s in its infancy. Maybe it’ll get smarter. https://t.co/a8q3uyWgQQ
@rickyleepotts @united their DM response is basic, they’ve said they are working on getting me on my way. Not even sure what that means
Yeah me too, why don’t @united tell all my fans and followers, if I’ve got it wrong. Would love to hear from them too, publicly. https://t.co/t8LR75wOa9
.@united are interested in mass new customer acquisition, not rewarding loyalty.
.@united has gone from a customer focused business that rewards loyalty, to a bus in the sky that nickels and dimes everyone for everything
@beornborg @united It’s management plain and simple. This is how a company like @united crumbles. They change their monetization model.
@united Is your computer broken? You have my full name. I’m sitting on a tarmac in 1A with a bunch of pissed off passengers. Chicago to IAD.
By @united staff @IAD &amp; many other places including attendants (as recently as yesterday) that if you’re not in a tie you belong in the back
@GarethDEdwards @united And not saying it’s bad to fly economy or something we’ve done that many times and still do for personal travel. It’s just the assumption
@GarethDEdwards @united The @united staff says “sir economy check in line is on the other side”. It’s happened so many times you can’t even count.
Oh that’s not all. You should see IAD ground staff. Every time we go to 1k check in (I literally see these people every weekend)…. @united https://t.co/GfYYosK6ZU
It’s not that, its what the flight attendant insinuated. Like, we hadn’t paid for @united business tickets. https://t.co/CEvubNu7Gw
@lacyinwonderlnd @united Seriously why do we spend hard earned money on a company like @united that treats us (and others) like complete s%#t
.@united : this https://t.co/AkjJ0olODp
@united No, I can’t do your job for you. Sorry. You muppets figure it out. We want our flights for the entire weekend paid for and an apology.
@united No I can’t DM you details. You can call my wife or me for details. We are absolutely appauled what’s become of this airline.
And also @united you should be using the United application to alert passengers to aircraft problems so they can stay in their hotels/home
.@united you should be giving staff sensitivity training to not deeply insult long time customers because they aren’t in a business suit
Super angry @united passengers deplaning and everyone sitting here pissed off with little announcement of what is happening.
So finally, today, we are flying from Chicago to IAD and get here. MORE @united maintainence problems. And we are sitting on the runway
And show before my performance last night in Chicago. Making last night super stressful.
So on the @united delayed flight from Dallas to Chicago with uber rude staff, we get there late and then are rushing to a family dinner
Thats a true story. Can you imagine? I’ve been flying @united airlines for 20 years. To be treated this way is beyond the pale of insulting.
So this @united flight attendant looks at him and then at me, and says “Yeah our real problem is too many free upgrades”
This passenger said to her he was a “global” and was annoyed I had a pile of laptops and Roli blocks all over my seat.
Next @United flight from Dallas to Chicago? More problems, rude flight staff. On this one flight attendant was talking to another passenger
From this one @united flight, we were able to spend less time with our family in Dallas, and made my performance there Friday very stressful
On Friday @united flight from IAD to Dallas, delayed for hours, deplaned…rude flight staff and they gave us a bottle of water.
This weekend alone @united has for my wife, my daughter and myself…plainly screwed up all our family plans and travel to performances.
Bags lots too many times to count (literally Employees are obviously under tremendous duress and the chain of command seems to be a disaster
After that our family has been accepted in and then thrown out of Global Service several times, treated like crap by flight staff(s)
It really started downhill after the @united and continental merger. Before that it was a fantastic airline, great customer service
I have to say @united airlines has gone from the best to the worst airline on earth in a few short years
Chicago! Can’t wait to see you guys tonight at @themidchicago with @shane54music.   But first…sushi at @Sunda
@valleeffect we are about to launch a new site.

Smells like analog synthesizers and cinnamon in here. Let’s do this.
For real check out tPowerDX7 guy on Youtube. He’s been BLOWING my mind. Pulse width mod pads and poly plucks. Insane https://t.co/vUr5P6PVFA
Unfortunately 12 bit DAC is a ton of the magic @laughing_mantis @djtt88 Once you get your head around some vintage FM there is no going back
It’s just tons of memorization @djtt88. Learning what algorithms are good for what and what harmonics occur naturally in what instruments.
Start by checking out PowerDX7 on youtube @_tableforone that guy is the best FM programmer I’ve EVER heard. Ever.
It’s absolutely extraordinary. And can as rich and warm as subtractive analog synthesis. After all, look at Eno. DX7+H3000=MAGIC
I have to say @djtt88 FM synthesis has always been daunting to me, but Ive finally bit the bullet and am learning it inside out.
Of course everything has it’s place. There are wonderful soft instruments that do completely new things. But, analog polys speak to my heart
They are a physical event. And this makes them completely different. When you record one you record an event not a computation.
But mostly what it is, is that they are not a stream of numbers in a computer. They are electrons coursing through circuits.
And the forced workflow and the haptic feedback you get from these instruments, I could go on and on.
And what is so different from a physical synthesizer, drum machine or modular synthesizer. Part is how gloriously unpredictable they are.
Reading fantastic book about subtractive and FM programing this morning from the 80’s &amp; something occurred to me, why I love synths so much
Gym, study, studio repeat. Beast mode today.

Got the OB-6 midi’d up to my OBXa and am dying over here. These two are peanut butter and chocolate. Blowing my mind.
Have you guys checked out @dsiSequential and @tomoberheim OB-6? This is the most vintage sounding modern synth I own. Mental.
My last tweet before official announcements: if there were a synthesizer based on Spectral Convolution, it’d be the greatest thing ever.
@unknownfear google is your friend
Miami Vice FTW. https://t.co/IyjDHEtQ1H
AMAZING night. Thank you Russia! &lt;3 you guys. https://t.co/bsIVMiVIX9
There is no such thing as a synthesizer based on spectral convolution…yet. *whoops* LOL! Big news soon.
It’s so exciting now hearing @izotopeinc BreakTweaker on the radio and in films etc. I can’t WAIT to hear what you guys will do with Phobos
Amazing day of food, family and droning on the moors. Thank you England for the wonderful trip.
Anyone know where to get a legit copy of (the now defunct) ZERO-X Seamless Looper v2.0?
Gatecrasher was spectacular. What a stunning night. Thank you England.
Gatecrasher!! Catch my modern set at 11:30 and all classics at 1:30. See you soon 👊🏻

@Bodhi_Zaffa they are an apex predator of the sea, not against humans.
@Bodhi_Zaffa …but it’s the ocean? Humans need the ocean, oceans need sharks, see the conundrum?
Setting up twitter on the studio computer plus 3 web cams. Wow am I going to have some insane studio videos for you guys soon!
@trance_snob 💪🏻
@tokiojones @weatherchannel the video they are sharing is the exact reason people don’t care about the oceans apex predator disappearing.
@weatherchannel Your odds of a fatal shark attack are 1 in 11.5 million worldwide. Driving in your car is more dangerous.
@weatherchannel 100 million sharks on average are killed every. single. year. And to help stop that, people have to be less scared of them.
Hey @weatherchannel, this (https://t.co/BTit5O4RaZ) is not cool. Way to go making shark propaganda to frighten people.
Thinking of showing you guys a bit of the proces I used to make The Upside Down…would you be interested? 🤔
@MIKEOLMUSIC I’m definitely on there.

With aspiration and hope in my heart, I am looking forward to 2017. I'm ready to turn over a new leaf.
I can say without reservation, amongst my family, my close friends, our country and in the world, 2016 was a pretty bad year.
George's voice was one of my favorites &amp; I found it so inspiring he produced &amp; sang. Along w/Prince he is someone I always wanted to meet.
I am so saddened to hear of the passing of George Michael and Carrie Fisher. Leia was my 14yr old crush and Faith one my my fav albums ever.
Happy Boxing Day to England ps!

@ValerieAlanis21 it's like going to @Spotify for a royalty check lol.
@ValerieAlanis21 let's start with not using "good music" and @atsoundcloud in the same sentence.
Dude. This. Is. INSANE. https://t.co/JMroWoiJft
But where I hope it's headed, is audiences domestically, demand more interesting, less formulaic, more educated electronic music.
Well I can answer actually, all the EDM guys that have jumped on the deep bandwagon are about to start making bad techno.
I get asked in interviews a lot "where is dance music headed". I can't answer that, but I can answer where I hope it's headed.
Are struggling in the culture set in place by big corporate festivals and perpetuated by horrible music and myopic/uneducated artists
In all seriousness, it kind of hurts my heart some that such talented people (I'm talking same conversation with a dozen producers you know)
Make a dry board we can sit by the campfire and read together. 1. I will never set the tempo of my DAW to 128 again 2. I will delete Nexus
So maybe I should start a summer camp for disgruntled dance music producers. We can zip line, trust building exercises, go fishing. Lol
That they "need to get away from EDM" and how am I allowed to "make music I like?"
I get DM's, Emails &amp; Texts daily from friends and peers that are extremely successful dance music producers asking if they can "come visit"
Funny thing I'm going to share with you guys this morning. Couple tweets to follow, no names will be mentioned.

And my absolute favorite thing about the AMA yesterday (drum roll....) https://t.co/rxAyX2fDeG
❤️ this. Amazing questions yesterday from you all. https://t.co/gf0fEGabGw
@davebyrd understand totally. In exciting news I'm making songs their original length (longer) and finding so much unreleased stuff!
I LOVED the AMA yesterday. What incredible, articulate, creative fans I have. https://t.co/YJgXsTcLX3
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/yHgGJPmdms
@davebyrd it won’t change any of the compositions. People remaster albums all of the time.
@davebyrd it was a reward for the kickstarter for electronic opus.
@davebyrd not sure what this means
@BCamTX @MUTEMATH I’d love that. My wife and I were listening to Vitals today in the car and talked about this.
It's getting preeetttyyy nerdy over at my @reddit_AMA. Answering all of your questions here https://t.co/Vrc23sO4fG
And my @reddit_AMA is now live here : https://t.co/Vrc23sO4fG  Ask me anything! https://t.co/qu2I3fszIu

@andih72 no not at all. It's fairly unrelated to all my other works.
@Teaboy_thurible and good art directly addresses and parses subtext and emotional complexity by its very nature. Hence, "she".
@Teaboy_thurible if for no other reason than because of their astute ability to communicate emotionally, women are more inherently complex
@Teaboy_thurible great question. I think even the most masculine of creative works is inherently let's say at least 51% feminine.
@cwharris and my advice to people that want to make music or any kind of art, anything really, is do you HAVE to do it? If yes, start doing.
@cwharris because of a quite literal biological imperative. I am literally compelled to make sound.
@jaminbradley a nighttime drive is a good idea for sure.
You guys it’s out!! What do you think so far? Pick up the album here https://t.co/ZZYDSlMd4J
@djbenharvey thanks man. I’ve got some wow what is this music coming Friday. If you’ve got 20 mins check this out https://t.co/BcHkHTEtDW
@256Pi hey there, I think just physically for now. It’s so much music plus the videos
If you’ve got 19 minutes and some great headphones, you are ready for Artifacture.   https://t.co/JSl7qnDVIc  Buckle up. Enjoy.

Really enjoying the things you guys have shared over here : https://t.co/P9fA56hXSb To show my appreciation planning a FB live for Monday.

@Sinthoid @PDwob in short, it's taken a full year and organized into a great folder system. Quite an ongoing project.
❤️ https://t.co/fKUwhgXWzj
@macdigger it will alright! In fact is sound blinding in just 5.1. The mix is not adapted for this environment it's redone. Truly beautiful!
Absolute BEAST mode in the studio. 7/8 rhythms at 160+ bpm FTW!
@macdigger @BlackHoleRec kind of like how a Ferrari is "only" away to get from point A to point B.
@macdigger yes the "only" thing that is new is 1,000 hours of face melting 9.1 surround mixing. Only. Lol.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/jzNBdBe3KL
@Aerotekmusic I am 🤔
@PDwob no it's actually 2,000 unique sounds. Like the craziest game of memory you've ever played in your whole life.
Prepping for a big orchestral record this weekend. Great to take a break from a 2,000 track autoload!
David's incredible. Super proud to participate. Excited to do more! https://t.co/t8kofk5qEk
Thanks Peter such an honor to be apart of! https://t.co/Sa9MGouFTS

We are proud to announce the first ever @TheSilence Vinyl EP release this Sept 19th. Pre-Orders available here!! https://t.co/dGb0JvKIWJ
@7Rising All of them. I have running rigs from 9.22 through latest OS. Do different things on all of them especially OS9 and pre 10.4.
Announcements to follow later today. *Hint* there is more than 1. (All Hail @TheSilence)
@justinmeyernl no
Without question or compromise, we are sharing this with you exactly as we want as a band. If you "get it" it'll be your fav thing ever.
So to get started, if you don't have one of these: you're gonna need one! Here's one for 50$ https://t.co/JPVkKnsvdl
There is a physicality to the way we created this EP and upcoming album that is palpable. Literal blood, sweat and tears.
We made this album on instruments from a largely forgotten era in music making. Vintage modulars, reel to reel analog tape machines etc.
Part of what makes this project so special is how personally passionate we are about the songs and the way it was created.
Beyond excited to announce All Hail @thesilence speaking for both of us this is one of the most special projects we've ever done. Ever.
Appears some very smart fans have figured out what we are up too. Tomorrow is gonna be a big day. All Hail @TheSilence.
There is some actual fan hacking going on right now. Lol! #AllHailTheSilence 🔥
How are y'all buying something we haven't posted! I'm worried we'll sell first pressing before we announce. You guys are sneaky 😂
Show of hands, who's ready for some brand new music? https://t.co/uaWjsdipkt
We are so excited to share All Hail @thesilence SOON!! https://t.co/PEzcK9Kmd3
🦄 https://t.co/4wOR6awU1R
https://t.co/hf9KpecdI5
It'd be a good idea to keep an eye on the All Hail @thesilence Instagram, FB and Twitter accounts this week. A really good idea.
👊🏻 https://t.co/03PeRjbkPu
Thanks for an amazing night  https://t.co/39wyJCaHni
It's INSANELY hot here in Az tonight. Excited to perform for you guys in Phoenix!
Sunny Southern California meetings on meetings. Hearing about some killer films and tv stuff. Hard to pick!
Meeting over at @amazon excited to hear about their upcoming film projects.
What if I told you All Hail @TheSilence was going to play you our album in a secret location in LA this month AND you could win a ticket 🔥
Warms my heart hearing 256 note triplets exponentially interpolating to 8th's on the RADIO. Mission accomplished! #BreakTweaker @iZotopeInc
We are starting to hear #BreakTweaker everywhere! Heard it on new @katyperry song and new @XAmbassadors "Unsteady" https://t.co/YUi3DNOXWt
My pleasure. For a pool party, that went OFF.  https://t.co/dGB4IFVjwu

Kansas City you RULED. Thank you guys for the absolutely wonderful night. That was awesome.
Excited to be in KC. Barbecue (✔️) saying a prayer for the athletes at the olympics. Enjoying watching.
And the Juno 60's alive with MIDI, an IEC socket and red LED bender. #studio https://t.co/uP1flO8ciM

What a wonderful story. If you think the worlds gone off the rails, read this : https://t.co/kwxipY298H
YEAAH! See you there :) https://t.co/j7SmjyaG74
And a final shout out to my buddy @DSIsequential because I just read they used lots of Daves#'s Prophet 6. And man this score is ANALOG.
There you have it @stranger_things is an absolute masterpiece. If it doesn't win every award this year, someone did it wrong. WATCH IT NOW!
We are talking shades of new order, Blancmange, The Blue Nile, Tangerine Dream, @thehorrormaster. Absolute analog 80's synth lushness.
W/rooms filled w/vintage poly synths. Ahem 😳 I digress. Kevin Dixon and Michael Stein killed it so hard with this score it's indescribable.
The music? WOW. First I should say I have major and I mean major score envy. This is like the dream job for someone who grew up in the 80's
It is so authentic, stylistically, aesthetically, in sound and scope to movies from this time period it's like scary.
If you crossed The Goonies, ET, Donnie Darko &amp; about 100 other of my favorite movies you'd get Stranger Things. It's a work of pure genius
The new @Netflix show @Stranger_Things directed by The Duffer brothers is one of the greatest things I've EVER watched in my entire life.
In lieu of citing my track record of picking things that are awesome. EVERYONE LISTEN UP.
Now let's start here, this is the guy that told you The Band Perry would win everything with "If I die Young" before it was on the radio :)
First, thanks @BlakeLewis for hipping me to quite possibly one of the greatest things I've ever watched. Ever. (Including some 80's favs)
Prepare for like a twenty tweet tirade.
A fully albino, mature buck. It's an incredible Indian totem. Google "albino buck Indian totem". Mind = blown. It was stunning in person.
We just saw maybe the most amazing thing ever. Look close. https://t.co/hzWfGXs5QE
Time for an Acai bowl and the beach. Happy Saturday y'all!
@deadmau5 sent you something via @RichardDevine to give your ATC's a good workout. Hope you enjoy.
@deadmau5 I don't know what this magic is you speak of but I'll be looking it up right now!
@morganpage @Sahamali not crazy at all! Dude my server PC (VEPro) is 38 core and 350G of RAM. Next main computer is a PC for sure.
@deadmau5 unfortunately our termed comes from a tree (line of site). Real life. No options either. You sold me one though. Gonna get it 👊🏻
@morganpage @Sahamali @apple there's no money in it for them Morgan. They're after soccer moms now.
@deadmau5 sweet just saw this tweet I'll check these out for sure. Thanks for the tip.
@deadmau5 if you've field tested something and love it if love to hear about it :)
@deadmau5 have you got a system you like? We've got pretty slow internet so I'm thinking a couple GoPro's and the black magic box.
Love the enthusiasm. This is gonna happen for sure. Anyone with a working multi-cam system and just general feedback, I'm super listening!
.@MJMSessions okay killer I'll look this up. Would you recommend a stand alone rig? Mac/PC? Can you do camera switching in that software?
This is a great point @Mariandipietra ! So 2-3 cameras and a screenshare. Anyone know of a camera switch that would work real time?
Also anyone with experience, what's the optimal way to go? Individual computer? Mac/PC? Best cameras? Way to stream HD audio? I'm listening!
Thinking about setting up a multi cam (GoPro?) setup to stream live sessions, producing, modular and sound design sessions. Interested?
Columbus was absolutely fantastic last night. Thank you all for rocking so hard in spite of the heat! See you again soon Ohio 👊🏻

Nope! New BT album and The Silence album are both done @jimpenola @THR @thesilence
Yep album 10 picking a release date now @adomus07. Annnnd, it's 2 1/2 hours of music.
👍🏻 https://t.co/eualVtkirN
@VZavadskyy @THR You have to be there to experience it. Every piece of it was written to work together, walking around is incredible.
@VZavadskyy @THR When you add it all up, over 4 1/2 hours for five areas in the land. In stems, over a TB.
This may have been the hardest secret to keep for two years, well, ever. https://t.co/U3ZMqF7hTN
.@romosapiens It's released today in 256 channel surround sound. Gotta get on a plane and head to Shanghai to hear it!
I am proud to announce I have written the full score for Tomorrowland at Shanghai Disneyland. https://t.co/g39CDtb5Oj #ShanghaiDisneyland

No current gear list @felixbird and yes it's a Samsung 40" 4K display. I love it.
@TiagoJoseMC yes because Its one of the few albums of mine I own and I don't want it on Spotify.
On OS9 Logic 6.43 with a 24bit maxed out PT rig and Abelton Live 4 (occasionally) @will_taurion it's all about the plugins and applications
@ErinSharoni 🔥

We're planing my new studio literally down to 1/16" of an inch of tolerance. Gonna be amazing. What a puzzle!
Dear film directors, kindly bring back the 90's thriller. Thanks in advance.
Grateful for the sacrifice of the brave men and women that keep our country  safe and free.
It's a beautiful day for a studio break and a walk. Fantastic new music in progress.
7:21 of the densest, most elegant, detailed music I've ever made done done. Things are a' brewing!

Profoundly well said @irvingazoff Music community this is a must read. Listen up @YouTube. https://t.co/MTZOSugBOl
@DarienFaust @syd_viciously @AvalonHollywood @MaxGraham @JohnnyYono you say this as if it’s past tense. *is amazing
Right now it looks like a @UAudio Thunderbolt Octo @AlexRugerMusic one day soon it won't look like anything, it'll be the cloud.
Instead of stagnating in 40 year old ideas, push sound design &amp; electronic music truly forward in to the future w/reverence for the past.
So let's embrace synthesis poineers, use an off computer platform for DSP and think of new things that make exciting new forms of sound.
Of current computer systems (even though modern computers are insanely powerful).
And lots of developers compromise on audio fidelity and or functionality because of the computational load of their designs and limitations
Because now in a handful of SHARC chips we have the power of hundred Synclaviers or Hartmann Neurons.
&amp; secondary but important though is I wish all my friends that are software developers would get behind a single "off computer" DSP platform
And give them the platform from which to birth new ideas. Cameron Jones, Axel Hartmann, these guys need to be designing new instruments.
At any rate a couple things need to happen that aren't happening right now. We need to embrace the creators of these pioneering instruments
As a point of digression this is also why I think The Beatles are the greatest band ever, because they combined "new" with fantastic songs.
I'd say, that excites me more than music in general. Sounds I've never heard. Elegant, academic, expansive, agressive, doesn't matter, NEW
With reference and reverence to the past of course but that's how this music started. The want to hear sounds we'd never heard before.
Who needs another subtractive synthesizer? Shouldn't we all want to push electronic music soundscapes into the future?
Is the minds of the people that created these new and or addendum's to new synthesis modalities. Now there is so much imitation in synthesis
Occurs to me the most important thing about a synthesizer like this that broke ground (literally making sounds we'd all never heard)
I am so inspired by this Synclavier V development. What a stunning sounding instrument. It's absolutely blowing my mind.
Brain is exploding with ideas this lovely, rainy Saturday morning. Apologies in advance for the so not "140" character, thought train!
Thanks for the love! https://t.co/bvcdHVKjCG
I do this too for the record. Any song you've of mine you've ever heard I've done this with. On a quiet country road https://t.co/oI1wyq3aj8
Can't wait to play Paradiso!! ❤️ Washington.  https://t.co/pNTAOnTD5C
Everyone would buy that as a main controller. To the original specs. Poly aftertouch, military grade components, Dave Smith T8 keyboards.
Today's million dollar matchmaking idea. Dear @ArturiaOfficial partner with @UAudio to run Synclavier V AND make a run of USB Orc keyboards
Hot damn @SwitchedOnTX !!! Want the first one. Can't wait.
👊🏻 https://t.co/6hHC4DxO3i
So @ArturiaOfficial Synclavier + @iZotopeInc Ozone 7 + @valhalladsp Room have officially, completely and totally melted my brain. STUNNING.
It's like Christmas 1978 up in here. DLing the Synclavier FM engine and waiting for @SwitchedOnTX to open so I can pre-order a NEW MODEL D!
Part two: @moogmusicinc is re-releasing to the original spec the MODEL D (wait for it) with MIDI and a dedicated LFO. I can't even.
Part one: Arturia has collaborated with the creator of the Synclavier, using original code and made a PLUGIN OF ITS FM SYNTHESIS! 😳
Buckle up gearheads today is probably the best day in synthesis for like 10 years. I wish they'd spaced out the good news! Insanity. Ready?
@andygrayedout can't wait to hear it. Will do :)
Flocking algorithms, Mandelbrot set, Golden Mean, Lorenz attractors @BC_Man you can find all that and more in the last 20 years of my music.
Told you guys, Paul has found more than anyone! https://t.co/eeZt1ivDZZ
😳👀💥👊🏻 https://t.co/UQ2K1mw9LE
.@reneesales @BC_Man Paul rightfully holds the claim to having found more than anyone I've ever met! I'll RT some of you post them @dalnat
No one has found that one @BC_Man but yes you can make fractals in music. That one took me about 3 weeks to make by hand. 😊
So hears one I'll tell you about @BC_Man there is a nano-rhythmic fractal of the entire composition The Internal Locus, hidden in the song
A number have been found @BC_Man and once or twice a year I'll meet people that find these intentional hidden musical meanings, puns etc
This has never come up @BC_Man (I've never publicly talked about it at least) but lots of my music has Easter eggs in it.
Absolute pleasure :) https://t.co/NXLM9pz0OP
Prepare to actually die when you check out the new @iZotopeInc plugin Vocal Synth. Sickest vocoder plugin ever. https://t.co/qtFHVac0NX
It's Karplus Strong opcode in Csound, CDP batch scripting, BreakTweaker and about 3500 bespoke edits my hand 😳👊🏻 @may_knee_er
Making sounds like a rogue MRI machine meets a sonified cloud chamber. Mental. Bending metals. https://t.co/5PIFzMvFco
JET. LAG.
@Richard_Grey all sequenced there. Still have all the sounds actually, just checked. https://t.co/TETv0d90bJ
Wow.  https://t.co/Heh3kF8mTO
And that Apple will lead this charge @adomus07 I also think it'll be terrible but writing is on the wall.
I think people will completely abandon the sale of music @adomus07 and only support streaming.
I have a prediction I've not read anywhere yet. Apple will phase out iTunes inside 3 years. What do you guys think?
@Richard_Grey it wasn't "us guys". I made this song on an MP60 Korg O3r Juno106 and a General Music S2. I mixed it on a Boss 8 channel mixer
Home for the most beautiful day ever. Headed to Sunday service and then some studio time. Happy Sunday.
👍🏻 @Richard_Grey I wrote Cassa de X straight out of Berklee. Secondary sub-dominant Eb chord was Sharams idea. Jk. https://t.co/C0cs06Pn1C
So proud, tired and headed home. Hello Chicago!
The coolest part ever is that it will live on, even when I'm not there in Shanghai. Like eating breakfast in US, music still playing.
I can't believe over 2 years work is done, stemmed, mixed, delivered and installed. What a crazy feeling. Amazing.
@cebsilver dude address on PM I'll send you some 👊🏻
.@Moen8105 my favorite module is the ER-101. Greatest sequencer ever. Erbverb is another must have. 4ms clock dividers too.
Well China you've been awesome. Disney I'm truly grateful for this experience and opportunity. Time for the long journey home.
Except the weird part where I wrote everything, played all the synths &amp; did all the drum programming @dubfire @DJSHARAM but yeah it's sweet!
Kinda @Moen8105 https://t.co/DgJsdO4c4Q
Full blown sleep depravation mode. Last night. It's the final push through! Fly in a couple hours.
@Bastianos @howett @Davidlost @three @johnlewis bang on your moms. It's @btcare mingers
For sure big announcement coming soon @The_Typer @TheRealHeadshot @XenonMazi
Just checked @TheRealHeadshot @XenonMazi 300 million people will here the music I've written in person this year. But only in person.
Hundreds of thousands of people will hear it every year, @TheRealHeadshot @XenonMazi but only in person, in Shanghai China!
You'll have to come to Shanghai to hear it @XenonMazi, it'll never be released and a stereo recording could never capture this magic.
Today, will also involve a couple hours of serious fun. If I was not NDA'd I'd have the worlds most epic Instagram feed right now, ever.
This entire project has been such an extraordinary experience. This last round of mixing in crazy speaker arrays is icing on the cake.
Last day/night of mixing in Shanghai. Absolutely mind blowing speaker arrays. First time I've ever mixed for a quad channel in a 9ft hole.
@djthd no @btcare are. Learn to work Twitter.
Xo and 👊🏻 from Shanghai. You will die when you see/hear what we're up to over here. Hope it's going great there.  https://t.co/s5Uy5zV5hs

@spiffy_spence @ElectronicOpus okay try this using the SUDO command https://t.co/dhekrDgTSP BE CAREFUL ITS THE CORRECT DRIVE!
Getting ready to go to China. For what you ask? You'll just have to wait and see. Hint: it's amazing.
@adomus07 @nicholaspersac I don't know any artists that have control of their music. That's a pretty presumptuous assumption.
@adomus07 @nicholaspersac the labels and most labels make a high royalty they don't pay through AND accept insider bribes like IPO shares.
Pumped for the studio today. First, time to vote.
@spiffy_spence @ElectronicOpus you on a Mac or PC I can teach you to command line format this SUDO in OSX terminal.
@nicholaspersac none taken :) truth be told wish none of my stuff was on there. Sucks because I love it too, it's just unfair to artists.
@rickysmirnoff thanks ❤️ great memories this one.
@nicholaspersac so it can get 0.00000001$ per play? Send your address, would rather send you a free copy.
YES.  https://t.co/KUKYEEC1n8
If there was a survey asking if she likes kick drums and loud orchestral musiic, I'd have given it. So far blaring Prince, we're all good.
I'm tired of looking the other way when I can do something helpful. Even something small. So welcome to our family, we've named her Pearl
She's had a hard knock life but is so loving and sweet it just felt like the absolute right thing to do.
Turns out she was terribly attacked by a dog years ago that scarred her sweet little head and killed her litter of kittens.
She was feral but cared for by the next door neighbors at our Air B&amp;B. They were overjoyed we would take her because they were very allergic
Well, went to Nashville, had piles of productive meetings, danced to country music and adopted a new cat.
SO Happy you got this and people are finally getting these. Thank @lacyinwonderlnd  https://t.co/2ngxVkzU5e
The only thing Nashville needs really bad is a killer vintage synth shop. Alright then meetings and meetings then time to fly.
@crosspoint_tv message was great. We will come back when we are in town for sure. ❤️ it.
I'd categorize it as thrilling to start a Sunday, singing @christomlin at @crosspoint_tv. Thanks for having us. Time for a Nashville brunch!
And this beautiful sunny southern morning, after a good coffee we are headed to @crosspoint_tv for service. Excited to check this place out.
Great meeting and food today. Checked out the incredible town of Franklin. Next up some very famous Tennessee fried chicken. #❤️Nashville
@DaveStewart cool! I heard you were living here these days. Would love to meet up some time soon. Have a great trip!
@davestewart I'm in Nashville and would be deeply honored to buy you a beer (coffee/kombucha/insert drink here). Pm if you're in town.
Nashville morning coffee on a porch with @lacyinwonderlnd. What a place this is. https://t.co/3WDPCPbg4Q
Thank you Prince for the music. Goodnight.
Sign of the Times, The Black Album, Dirty Mind, Delirious...these are literally how I learned to program drum machines. He will be so missed
His influence is omnipotent. Who else has ever written a bitonal pop song (Scandalous)? Such a blessing to have his rich catalogue of music.
After a night on the town in Nashville, talking to @lacyinwonderlnd and @DomiPaul about the genius that was Prince. What a gift he was.
Just found a book called "Don't forget to Sing in the Lifeboats". Without even reading, pretty sure this will be one of my favorites ever.
Omg Nashville. What a place. Fantastic meetings. Fantastic people. I could so live here.
👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻 https://t.co/CAZ0FIvTq6
Had my morning coffee overlooking a beautiful creek in the woods and now out for a packed day of meetings in Nashville. ❤️ this place.
Thank you Prince for the years and years of endless inspiration and transcendent music. You will always be one of my absolute heroes. #RIP

Pre-flight about to kill an Acai bowl at my favorite new spot in LA.
@somnambulist88 we feel really bad how you guys have been treated. Thanks for being patient. We're going to sort it out ourselves :)
And it's just @lacyinwonderlnd and I so keep it on topic and be patient but we're going to fix it all 😊
We are really honored and grateful to help sort all this Electronic Opus rewards stuff for you guys. Electronicopusbackerhelp@gmail.com
Meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings but first all must start with an Acai bowl and almond/coconut milk late.

@iamdmann pretty sure this is what go-pro's were designed for.
Just had a great workout with @bobbystrom and am seriously pumped so this may actually happen.
There are probably some very interesting reasons for this. Something to ponder over morning coffee. Happy Wednesday.
A clean blue as opposed to in the warmer color families. Reminds me of the differences in trees in US vs Europe. Totally different greens.
Beautiful Southern California morning. When you're not here for a minute, you really notice a difference in the quality of morning light.

Facebook is cited as a primary reason in over half of divorces. Sit with that one a moment.
@GgReErGg you must have big pockets to carry around a TV. Phones are omnipotent.
Facebook did create the void @MediaMaters before it people used to converse at meals.

Your greatest threat to happiness is not terrorism, the upcoming election, your job...your holding it in your hand reading on it.
When I see that blue bar on top of someone's phone I want to break their device, give them a hug and tell them a story in that order.
The worst thing to ever happen to society, the family unit, relationships and a lot of other things is Facebook.
This fills me with a bottomless existential sorrow. The people you love, even strangers deserve your attention, kindness, interaction.
Both have cell phones with Facebook open. Flipping, flipping, checking what is happening in other people lives.
Just watching a father and his teenage daughter eat breakfast at a resturant. They haven't said a single word to each other the entire meal.
@RRKS_Official nope I wish there was though. I do it by rendering the audio and converting an audio to MIDI clip in Live.
If I was to recommend something to new composers, it'd be find something meditative in your compositional process that's musically fruitful
Time correcting is more time consuming than anything I do compositionally. It's also just the most incredible sounding thing ever.

Everything micro rhythmic in that is BreakTweaker @RRKS_Official the incredible usage of interpolating between rhythm and pitch. Stunning.
And @JCollierMusic I look forward to seeing where your career takes you. You have the intangible "it". What a treat. That was stunning.

MIR convolution (like 300 impulses shot in a single room) is blowing my face off. Pair that w/@valhalladsp &amp; some @iZotopeInc Ozone 7 #dies
A blend of convolution and delay line reverbs + EQ, compression etc how incredibly specific and personal you can make these things sound.
It's incredible as you start to mix &amp; match favorite articulations from libraries with orchestral seating placements, custom scripting and

Hey tweeps, anybody got the last release version of Voyetra Sequencer + (4.11) not 4.10? 4.11 Apparently allows dual MIDI ports in DOS!

Well @TheGRAMMYs were awesome this year. My absolute favorite part? https://t.co/AlTTLuuIts Hero John Cage, won a Grammy. Great night!
And in other news a sound guy is about to be beheaded. Real life. Wow, way to go @Adele. Serious pro.
Everyone listening, that's what your hearing. Sounded like prepared piano. Insane that has be nearly impossible to sing to. What a pro.
Talk about a professional. Way to go @Adele holding it down when a piano mic falls in the piano @TheGRAMMYs
Also considering mapping mod wheel to Y axis on my @WeAreROLI and Expression to poly aftertouch. Wow this is actually an insane idea.
@Junkie_XL putting that epic synth collection to good use! Rock on 👍🏻
Alright fellow producers, anybody built a X/Y Touch OSC template for cc1 and cc2? Need one for iPad! Go!!

Director says (composer of the temp music who'll remain nameless but has the same initials) "Dude owes you money" More hysterical laughter.
And his assistant pulls him over and goes "BT invented that" and everyone was like 😳 Absolutely hysterical.

@Authorportrait outstanding.
Squad goals do #NAMMage @lacyinwonderlnd @christianburns_ @RichardDevine @amberdevine@AmberDevine1 @OfficialFractal
Okay first, when you see this on every shirt  2017, we made it up...
My point is this: if you want to innovate  you must do two things 1. Know the language 2. Know what came before you.
In actuality you're like "ever heard of John Cage? He did that 50 years ago"
I think this is why you frequently see young artists and producers with this myopic idea they are doing something revolutionary when...
The overwhelming implication is somehow not knowing traditional harmony, theory, how to read music etc makes you more creative or something.
It's like "I can't read a note, never studied anything". Congrats your illiterate. I actually don't know how to respond when people say this
Music is the only profession that people brag about not studying it. Am I the only musician this strikes as strange?
My #NAMM click : @lacyinwonderlnd @christianburns_ @RichardDevine @amber698 @OfficialFractal it's so game on.

@umwolverine13 @TommyTallarico @TribbleOrlFl @TanZgroup @ElectronicOpus I'm not in charge and am as miffed as you.
@umwolverine13 I sent all signed merchandise first of December to staff who are shipping them out to backers. Too many cooks in kitchen.
Thank you 😊 https://t.co/70dk3pHJVy
Try this immediately on your Mac, said no one ever. 172G of sounds loaded. The autoload grows!! https://t.co/NuKwtFrFXh
.@artofcomposing it's incredibly inspiring. It'd be awesome one on tone colors with demonstrations and examples. I'd for one love that 👍🏻
Alrighty time for some ferocious contrapuntal brass writing! Happy Thursday Twitterverse.
And @josealdojunior we all know you'll come back and beat that muppet @thenotoriousmma ass. Hope to be ringside for that one.
It's VEPro o'clock and I'm very excited to report I'm scoring a Brazilian film with director @afonsopoyart about MMA legend @josealdojunior
Producers &amp; composers looking to get inspired in the new year HAVE to check out @artofcomposing. Podcast is amazing Jon, super inspiring!

@TribbleOrlFl @TanZgroup @TommyTallarico @ElectronicOpus can you guys give Randy a hand pretty sure everything went out before Christmas!
Dear 2016 juice cleanse, I was jking. You win. Uncle. #CaffeinePlease
Hope you guys all had a Happy New Years. It may of been one of the happiest of my life not spent on planes and in hotel rooms.
Without a big overshare, this year my primary goal is STUDY. I plowed through 3 textbooks over Christmas, much more to come.
Those of you that are orchestral composers, check out the unbelievable https://t.co/83EfCzoCHT Brass and Woodwinds. HOW DID I MISS THIS!
Wishing each and every one of you a blessed, joyful and prosperous New Years. Happy New Year!!!
Had a blast visiting and working with you guys. When my new room is done you're invited here for sure 👍🏻 https://t.co/ibnnGeexT1
Alright, time to polish of "Ranges of Orchestral Instruments" while marveling at Alex North's epic score for Spartacus.
Anyone looking for Dan Brown/Michael Crichton type read check "One Second After" by @forstchen it's terrifying &amp; exciting in equal measure
I've got some other holiday recommends too. I'm on my 4th book over Christmas Break (3 compositional books and now a fun one)
@ElectricFamily it's beyond kick ass check it out. @thrivemkt
Sweet! https://t.co/c8lCfT7VKX
It's an insanely amazing find. Fellow healthy eaters, check them out. Super excited a service like this has cropped up!
.@thrivemkt (Thrive Market) things that we buy every week like agave, ghee, paleo-nolia etc are great price and free shipping over fifty $
Anyone here eating paleo or shops at places like Whole Foods for non-gmo and organic foods listen up: we just found the most amazing thing

The most futuristic music app ever on an iOS device. Unreal. Congrats @WeAreROLI on NOISE!! https://t.co/RY9qJGoPUU #makesomenoise
This will be the first New Years I've taken off in 23 years. I'm already so excited to spend this time with my family it's unspeakable.
If there's something more beautiful than the Flageolet articulation played by violin, viola, cello and contrabass I can't imagine it.
Thanks Brian! I'm enjoying scoring so much lately. It's a greater creative expression of where I'm at artistically! https://t.co/9BGWrgXFxq
.@howardjones fantastic. We can't WAIT! I'll have the kettle on and the Fairlight warmed up. Takes like 20 minutes to boot lol.
Thanks. Exciting stuff coming up in the 2016 :). Lots of new music for you guys!! https://t.co/rRlh4ICFgT
Wasn't a track it was a jam session (@iamhashbrown @Junkie_XL) on that same trip I jammed with Joe Strummer as well. It was quite the trip
if you're anywhere near us @howardjones I'd love to christen the new studio with a cup of tea together. Maybe @christianburns_ can join
And speaking of heroes @howardjones the day the Fairlight goes in (probably March)...
@MuteUSA thanks for the DM retweet. Tell @danielmiller there's a 200 year old email from me I'd love his thoughts on.
Weirdest place I've recorded @Junkie_XL is in a cave in box village with @petergabriel and a Thumb pianist.

Feeling this El Niño winter it's sunny and 65! Progress being made on the new studio 2.5 ton silent HVAC picked and going in! Happy Saturday
I love how Schroder plays two fingered like Nick Rhodes @koishiiandhush but sounds like Thelonious Monk.
Watching Charlie Brown Christmas. Feeling the Christmas spirit. Excited for Christmas.

So if you want to contribute, truly learn your craft whatever that is and build from a strong foundation. Always.
And a final thought, something can be successful temporarily and have no merit or longevity. And this is why dance music is stuck in a loop.
So if you're "getting by" doing the minimum etc : basically cheating, this reflects ultimately the sustainability of your work.
Hopefully this inspires a new thought in you creative types, the foundation from which you build determines the merit of the entire work.
Realized about half my work is creating an array of material, instruments, design &amp; workflow to draw from, in the hopes of birthing unicorns
There’s a bajillion things you can do with this technique. Try delays, flangers etc. You’ll flip out if you’ve never done this. Enjoy!
You can also fade out and reverse all the chords and put them under your progression for ear candy (and something not out of a sample pack!)
Better still cut the Emin arp reverb and put it after the Cmaj reverb reverse on the down beat. Presto tonal riser into tonic tonal crash.
Here’s a couple favorites. Take the 8 bars of Shimmer for the Cmaj chord and fade it out. Reverse it. You just made a sick riser.
You now have 4x 10 bar sounds (2 bars each of a chord arpeggiated &amp; 8 of a reverb throw) Now at this stage there’s so many things you can do
NEXT! Grab Valhalla Shimmer. Tune it up 7 (a fifth) and crank the decay to taste (longer is better here. Okay print that and cut it up.
In fact arpeggiate your whole progression &amp; split it into those chords. Now take 2 bar arpeggiated chords &amp; put 8 bars of silence after each
Take that chord &amp; make a short plucky sine wave (in anything) sharp attack quick decay to zero. Now arpeggiate your Cmaj chord at 32nd notes
Let’s say the progression is Em Dm Gmaj Cmaj. The chord before the tonic is a Cmaj. Okay. Let’s say that chord lasts 2 bars. With me so far?
Alright, producer tip of the day. Instead of sh**ty risers try this. It’s a couple step trick. Let’s say your chord progression is in Em
@Junkie_XL I’d love to hear some of your modular stuff man :)
@Junkie_XL AND Euro too! I’ve got some dotcom sequencers &amp; I’ve used a system some. They definitely sound vintage and are very musical
A pleasure.  https://t.co/ufmpHURg4S
@AndyBo1977 @TommyTallarico @tanzgroup @alexharrow no worries. Sorry it's taken so long.
@Junkie_XL love it man I didn't know you were a dotcom guy. Sweet setup!
@AndyBo1977 they're on there way by Christmas! @TommyTallarico do you get Kickstarter emails? I've never seen them. https://t.co/WtgIRN5OT8
Enjoyed this conversation immensely. We just went straight nerdcore. Love it. Blessings to all and goodnight :)
@tmad40blue incredible. I just wonder if with my obsessive focus it would literally make me crazy. It sounds like an incredible gift though.
Fascinating @tmad40blue do you notice the Pythagorean coma? Ever played a Yamaha CP70? Too many questions!
I've used Just Intonation a lot. The moving parallel fifths in the bass in Every Other Way for example.
Do you prefer Just Intonation or math tunings like Pythagorean to our 12 note hack @tmad40blue?
That fascinates me to no end @tmad40blue. I always lusted for perfect pitch as a kid. I've got great relative pitch though.
Awesome @tmad40blue! Out of curiosity what does non-12 tone music sound like to you? Gamelan for example. Do you like or drives you nuts?
All the minor 9 vocal rubs that Martin sings against Dave too @earthdyedred those guys blow my effing mind.
Totally @earthdyedred at times bordering on bi-tonality. Best pop example of that being the brilliant Prince's 'Scandalous'
@ObediaTutor the computer you guys made me is stunning man. So much thanks :)
Lots of fantastic inner voice movement with Depeche/Vince/Martin, fantastic modulation a and modal interchange too @earthdyedred
Tell you what, lesson 1, Depeche Mode's entire catalogue.
There must be other people out there that think (like I do) about the harmonic interaction of these new forms, if even just intuitively.
We have a bajillion new tonal colors to work with from subtractive synthesis to granular clouds and spectral abstractions.
I've thought about writing a syllabus for Full Sail or Berklee for modern counterpoint &amp; orchestration class. This would be epic useful.
Any other musicians here ALWAYS thinking counterpoint? The vocal against the bass, the inner voices (usually synths), It's non-stop for me.
A full day of counterpoint is like solving a Ribik's cube a thousand times. Passing tones, parallel fifths and unavailable tensions oh my.
About 35 finished minutes of beautiful music over the last 4 days. Grateful for sound, my family and the natural world. Goodnight.
Happy Hanukkah to my Jewish friends and followers. Just reading tonight's prayer. It's a beautiful one and a beautiful tradition.
@VxJasonxV it people doing indigenous singing and it's improvisational. Rotfling
@VxJasonxV but since IMA came out 1994 this in 2009 this is clear copyright infringement and an unlicensed sample. Thanks for the heads up.
@VxJasonxV it's not a sample. It's a field recording I made of Monkey Chanting. I've never heard this track until now.
@LessThan3 @Berghain check this out @erinsharoni it's some of the actual things we discussed. What a great read.
This is awesome. A fantastic read. Congratulations.  https://t.co/LVfhYUXzS8

@LegendaryCoffee out atm thanks for asking.
Using RX to make INSANE new drum one shots . Frequency specific compositing my analog drum machines and Eurorack.
@RobsRecStudio with you there
And the world's most powerful supercomputer, BlueGene, can manage only .002% of that
Amazing: If the human brain were a computer, it could perform 38 thousand-trillion operations per second.
Going through so much material from the IMA &amp; ESCM time period for mastering that's never seen the light of day 12min of Flaming June? yep!
It's a beautiful day for a post turkey workout. Still glowing with gratitude from yesterday.
@Kcijseries I'd recommend Kontakt and libraries. Best strings are LASS and Spitfire Albion II, Berlin and Cinematic Strings for staccato
Hope you all have a blessed, beautiful Thanksgiving. We’re cooking up a storm over here.
Insanity these Berlin Spiccato string articulations. These are incredible. Even better than LASS (my other favorite for this articulation)
So today I did assignments on 27 private stock pianos and 182 self-made surround percussion libraries. Slowly but surely!
Multiple time lines of controller data in the piano roll editor, intelligent quantize functions, it's scary good.
Cubase is SO advanced to Logic in every way it's actually staggering. Destructive audio (real hard processing with multi-level undo)
Setting up the autoload assignments in @steinburg Cubase is coming along great too. Crazy routing audio with meta frames and channel strips
This VEPro @pcaudiabs PC is incredible. Hardest thing I've ever set up in my life. I'm like 3 weeks in w/700 instrument autoload in progress
@calebjams yes the @BlueMicrophones mofi are STUNNING for that application
Got some amazing score cues out the door this am and rediscovering some SynthEdit 32Bit gems before headed out for a fall festival.
There's a beautiful moonbow here tonight. Feeling grateful for my family and friends. Have you all have a blessed Friday night :)
Wow.  https://t.co/N6AL10pCBw
@AmplifiedHitman coming to you soon! Promise.
@kdobs12 email laptopsymphony.assist@gmail.com for help
No I mean a netbook becomes a noded 1 million CPU supercomputer @Mariandipietra. Think HAL but real.
Fast forward a couple years, fast internet, server farm, offload heavy lifting DSP, deep sampled instruments over the cloud. #Thefuture
Feel like I’m glimpsing the future setting up VEPro rig. I can see where all this is going. MIDI and Audio over ethernet, no latency..hmm
I can’t wait to share what I’ve been working on. Keeping a project silent for over a year has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.
@tweetsfrmAltair you need all the @valhalladsp there’s no way around it. Go in this order, Room, Shimmer, Plate, Vintage.
@tomerbe @valhalladsp you’ll literally hear it all over it. The bending metal type stuff. It’s magical with Make Noise wogglebug.
@cmmorrow because the American record label hated/didn’t understand it
Went to tuck my daughter in &amp; found her doing the Harlem Shake to Ride off Movement in Still Life. File under most epic moment of the week
@tomerbe @valhalladsp it's brilliant Tom. Probably my fav Eurorack module ever. It's all over my Dark Places score. Like, entire cues.
@valhalladsp @tomerbe it'd be amazing for you to make something like this ITB, surround etc would be so INCREDIBLE.
@valhalladsp @tomerbe modulating the available parameters is psychotic. Super musical and unlike anything else
@valhalladsp @tomerbe part of what special about Erbverb isn't just exposed parameters it's how wide the range is. You can "break" it
@valhalladsp @tomerbe totally understand the challenge! Consider this an official request for a reverb for Sound Designers 👍
@valhalladsp I'll check this out for sure! I've been a fan of @tomerbe since early 90's Soundhack (which I still use today constantly)
Easily a 250-425$ product @valhalladsp I'll try Unobtanium my Matrix 12 &amp; Prophet 5 this afternoon. Can't wait. Thanks for the great stuff
Too it off by exposing every parameter &amp; making it "breakable" (like Erbverb) i.e. Self oscillate etc and you've got THE best reverb ever.
Throw in a couple LFO's and clockable step sequencers mapable to ANY parameter, have @RichardDevine design you crazy surround IR's
A 2 part engine, part 1 convolution, part 2 early and late reflections (your @valhalladsp algorithms) and everything in surround.
I have an idea for you Sean I think everyone would buy. Take all your @valhalladsp algorithms, and bundle into a new Reverb plugin where...
Hey @valhalladsp I wanted to congratulate you Sean, Plate is phenomenal. My favorite algorithm is "Unobtanium". Monstrous on percussion.
@rexnjay which dot rev? PM me!
Anyone got legit installer of the last PC version of Alchemy? Still have my serial numbers &amp; expansions, just need installer for VEPro rig!
Beast mode on Episode 106 of Wicked City. I don’t know how you’re gonna see it but the music is effing awesome.
Here's something you've never heard me say before, WOW on the new @justinbieber album. Killer work @Skrillex (and trainspotted #Stutteredit)
Music to picture composers, have to check this out. I beta’d this thing it’s STUNNING. https://t.co/UXAQGaELao

Absolutely freaking out on these sample libraries. If you’re looking for unusual Kontakt libraries, check this out : https://t.co/qRvsrdB1pi
Anyone here with significant Kontakt scripting experience? Pass it around, looking for a programmer for hire to do custom scripting.
Almost in NY to shoot the cover of @djmag. It's a beautiful Sunday day for a drive. Enjoying some @Anjunadeep
Been in contemplative prayer for Paris and the citizens of France. My thoughts are with you and the families of the victims.

Praying for Paris. Please do the same.
@daviddas and I'm thinking wormhole or something similar to connect them.
Hey @daviddas yes I'd love to know how you connect these. Are they on the same computer? I want to run Mainstage on a separate rig.

@ErinSharoni I don't think I've ever done a dance music interview (ever) where the interviewer mentioned Phillip Glass!! Thanks again 😊
@ErinSharoni pleasure was mine. Really enjoyed your candor and knowledge was truly impressive.
@DJmag @rjmcAssey @Anjunadeep @ErinSharoni she's someone who "gets it". Whatever you're paying her, it should be more.
Just had the best interview ever with @djmag Thanks Erin for the absolutely fantastic questions.
Thanks guys!! https://t.co/fABCuL0cnN
Watching my score of #WickedCity and feeling really proud of the music I've written. #superproud
@daviddas just figured out this won't work for me because I use lots of surround instances of EXS24 and Mainstage doesn't support surround
Man that's amazing @daviddas also the last version of alchemy for OSX is still available I believe and much nicer UI than the new one.
@lacyinwonderlnd that looks AMAZING
@djNaotaku like a professional program not a kids toy. Transition will be over the course of the next 2 projects and take an est 6-8 months
Anyone use a large MainStage multi-instrument controlled by IAC bus/VEPro? I’m working on a cool hack to use my Logic instruments w/Cubase
@thracianmusic mac’s have a shelf life of 18 months. I can replace a cpu for 1/10 the cost of a new mac. Oh and that 300G RAM, let’s be real
Wake up to an email today saying @valhalladsp PLATE is in your account. Enjoy. What is this sorcery!!!!! Sean you’ve done it again.
@BSLLondon @ToonHearing because it's @btcare ding dongs.
👍🏻 https://t.co/M0U1exEg55
.@Kcijseries If I let all my favorite music do that to me, I'd have quit a long time ago!
.@Kcijseries would love to hear what you come up with. Get inspired, not overwhelmed 😊
Hey @Kcijseries thank you for the compliment. In regards to the rest of what you said, your bar should always be one upping YOUR best :)
@Junkie_XL excited to see you on here btw man. Followed :)
@Junkie_XL well say a little prayer for me then man, cause truth be told I'm terrified but I think I'm gonna do it. Fingers crossed!
@Noisia_nl super agree with this too man.
@djdruso I was explaining my own personal compositional requirements.
@djdruso of course the number of tracks doesn't matter. Some of my favorite recordings are stereo masters.
@lae_eric @UAudio absolutely. They work amazing and their emulations crush literally every other company. Hands down.
@mennodejong and I'd love to hear a Trance track with 70-100 tracks because I've seen all the big guys sessions and they're all 30-40 tracks
For scoring stuff @mennodejong I need access to 1,500-2,000 instruments all the time, without loading. I just have different requirements
So again taking Every Other Way for example @mennodejong that's 789 tracks. I nearly killed the computer.
@rfwhyte @UAudio 1176 or LA2a Grey.
Composers @davedresden
And my final tweet of this production rant. Young producers, seasoned producers...the best plugins available now are @UAudio hands down.
And not saying it's bad @mennodejong either, I like some of this music, it's just not Stravinsky. We can agree on this I'll assume.
Let's be real @mennodejong what makes up your typical Beatport #1 trance track. 30-40 tracks? Midi, some risers? It's not heavy lifting.
Apple makes beautiful, overpriced, non-upgradable paper weights. For a third of the price you get 3 times the power with a PC.
And finally for the record, although I have them all over my studio. The days of Apple being the go to professional creatives tool are over
Cubase is the most serious, open ended tool and the most widely used by professional film composers.
Protools is a very expensive tape deck with good plugins and insufficient Midi Implementation (but better than Logic) and....
DAW landscape is as follows now : Logic is for Pop, hip-hop and EDM commercial music. FL and Live are the serious DAW's for dance music
I didn't know you were using this too Tom @Junkie_XL was the switch hard for you?
Sweet man I've already got a million questions @Noisia_nl I'm gonna email you for sure 😊
Via VEPro @christianthon than, buckle up, ready for it...LOGIC's INTERNAL INSTRUMENTS.
Logic is so slow and unresponsive so this is not saying a ton but it's faster to send midi over Ethernet and get the audio back Ethernet
VEPro is easily and I mean easily the most amazing technology I've seen in at least 10 years @christianthon
@Noisia_nl really appreciate this man. I'm switching.
And it cost 1/3 the price. So here’s my question….anybody out there using Cubase on a Mac? Does it do destructive editing? Do you like it?
The server class PC I just bought has 56 CPU threads available (as opposed to Mac’s 12), and 300G of RAM as opposed to 64G.
First step is looking at other DAW’s, next step (and this one will take some time) is abandoning the Mac altogether.
I need about 2,000+ deep sampled Kontakt and Play instruments on at all times. VEPro can handle this perfect. A mac with Logic X can’t
Which is insulting for a computer this expensive. So it’s time to actually look elsewhere in ernest. In order to do compositional work…
For me, on the most expensive Mac Pro with 64G (max) of RAM and the best video card, I get about 40 deep sampled Contact instruments
Seems there’s even more I didn’t know about the inner workings of the new Logic. Here’s the big news, if it works for you, it works for you.
Just had a massive (earth shattering) conversation with developers on the inside track about Logic, it’s audio engine and midi handling
Appreciate the kind words. So proud of this record and happy you guys are feeling it! https://t.co/pu3P9nt4A5
Thank you :) https://t.co/rXhvR3Pk6j
I hear #StutterEdit in country music all the time @BCamTX in fact there was a moment in the vocal breakdown for new Zac Brown song on CMA's
@simoncpage this is a @TommyTallarico and @tanzgroup question
And so wether you like country music or not, (and I happen to love it) it deserves our respect. It has mine.
And even more exciting, there is a comradery and community amongst artists and a respect for music, musicianship, family, country, faith
No asshats making things more better or stage diving with CDJ's off or glorification of objectification of women because it's not tolerated
You know why? Not tolerated in Country Music. Musicianship, songwriting, engineering is spectacular. People that have refined their craft
In short no ones a fraud.
No caddy drama/infighting between artists. People freely collaborating. Zac Brown Band, Keith Urban, Miranda Lambert+others just killing it
Next, no autotune anywhere to be found. Live performances were incredible. No one playing to tracks. Performance after performance.
Firstly, Girl Crush (rightfully) won everything like I said it would. Grammy's are next. Best song since "If I Die Young" by The Band Perry
Took a scoring break and watched part of the CMA's last night. Was shocked (in a good way) about many overarching attributes of the show
Hooking up @PCAudioLabs VEPro rig. Excited would be the understatement of the century. This is the Synclavier for 2015 #HelloOrchestraInaBox
Happy Halloween you guys. I'm so happy to not be in a club right now I could cry.
Srsly tho.  https://t.co/ghtLgmBFFl

It's a great pleasure to announce I've composed the score for the fantastic @ABCNetwork new crime drama #WickedCity staring @EdWestwick
What if I told you you could hear an hour of that music next Tuesday at 10pm on prime time TV? Idk maybe something scary before Halloween?
What the crazy scoring project is that I've been playing guitar &amp; frame drums w/knives! Well I've written close to 4hrs of music in 2 weeks
I've got a really cool announcement to make. Those of you who follow my Instagram (https://t.co/a7QHLrSjR3) may wonder...

No @christianburns_ but we are going to but you a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets @lacyinwonderlnd
Pretty sure @christianburns_ and I are having @RichardDevine withdrawal. To placate ourselves, about to pull out the Prophet VS.
@cebsilver if you're asking, I'd love to!!
If it helped save a single shark I'm beyond proud. Thank you for the work you're doing @sharktrustuk https://t.co/iUn9SI5n2w
@lacyinwonderlnd then he mumbles "a treeeuk to pullllrr it". Ryan Baxter will be easier to convert. @christianburns_

Hey guys I’ve got some pretty exciting news!!
@dalnat thank you Paul, you're deeply appreciated.
Listened to Stevie Wonder "Love's in Need of Love" on a rainy Fall morning. If that song doesn't say it all, idk what does #masterpiece

I've dove with these under a pier in Adelaide!  https://t.co/hEIiLb24Gm
@JasonDefine it's stunning. It kills me people get embarrassed it was their first DAW. If it was mine, I'd never ever ever switch.
Next DAW to give a fair shake is Cubase. It's been like (literally) since an Atari when I last opened it. Logic X is so sluggish it's crazy
@LaidbackLuke I wish Logic didn't feel like home. I'm looking all the time. Are you on a Mac or PC?
.@LaidbackLuke @DJMattHarvey Ableton is great I totally agree I just can't seem to wrap my head around it for film composition.
Just received a crazy email from @NI producers, watch out! CRITICAL compatibility warning with upcoming Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan upgrade
I am awed by our potential. I marvel at our capabilities as a species. I believe in the human race. Happy Sunday.
Sweet!!! Out today on @anjunabeats my colab with @iBluestone @Steflang - All These Wounds  @beatport - http://t.co/Ww5cKa11qs #TranceFamily
You’re probably talking about my modified TB-303 (Devilfish) @modular_madness
Just read this on the interwebs “There aren't many of us who can honestly say that they've never sampled a YouTube video” Have you??
Uh, yes.  https://t.co/ZyARp4jnsB

Fall workout. Gettin'it! http://t.co/yzdo6L6BpF
Pleasure man enjoy! @RobsRecStudio
.@RobsRecStudio @KPLONDONradio @iZotopeInc You can do per1/16th changing swing. Super precise &amp; evolving! http://t.co/3Th3hB10jQ
You can do really complicated swing by making a 1/16th note an 1/8th then subdivide and play with tension and subdivisions @RobsRecStudio
Loved St. Augustine Gospel Choir’s singing this morning for @Pontifex and reveled his message of love and tollerance #popefrancsis
And for my final shark statistic: more people die per year taking selfies than by shark attack. I think this case is now closed.
Today I printed an 8 bar click, reversed the phase and summed it with all the loops. Presto. Gone! #productiontricks
Made an insane discovery today. Last night I printed a bunch of percussion loops with the click on. I thought they were (obviously) unusable
It's stunning how an innovator like Bartok's influence can be heard years after his major works. Inspiring inspiring music.
Listening to Bartok music for Strings, Piano &amp; Celesta and reminded that there are such deep wells of unexplored harmonic material and form
Amazing studio day and now headed to the movies. So happy to not be in a club there's not words. Happy Saturday!
@therealdjedit sounds like yes! I'll check it out. Thanks
@RealBenCarson happy birthday
Love hearing what you guys are doing with this. Counted it 3x on the radio today! https://t.co/D3jNLD89XN

@GarethWalker76 agreed
Nice pictures. Are those oceanic white tips? If yes I'm jealous! https://t.co/ORXsX7N6gv
@AveneMusic no the biggest killer are people (piles of imperial data to support this) and I don't know a single healthy vegan.
Just noticed my most important statistic didn't post. We kill 75 to 100 MILLION sharks a year. Wake up and spread the love for Sharks.
Want to help? Donate money to an organization that helps shark preservation like @SharkTrustUK. Most importantly, spread the right numbers
I invite any of you, to spend 50 minutes of your life on a dive w/a hundred reef sharks and tell me their beauty does not bring you to tears
As my favorite living creature, I hope we can all look at what we are doing to the shark population through more accurate optics.
Sharks are (arguably) the single most important part of our seas ecosystem. It is ignorant that we perseverate on shark attacks.
And most importantly, we kill 75-100 MILLION sharks a year. This is disgraceful. We should be ashamed.
Here's some facts for you. Snakes kill 100,000 people per year. (Brace yourself) mosquitoes kill 1 MILLION people a year.
First you can read this : sharks have killed 580 in recorded history (since 1580) here : https://t.co/FZViscrqr1
This morning some statistics. People have an unnatural, irrational fear of sharks. We kill these beautiful apex predators at a stunning rate
.@thebigern depends totally on the composition, composer and intent. This is something I myself do!
Yes @Bruce35dc if you could perceive an impulse train at 40,000 hertz as a rhythm, you'd notice a difference.
Have their own music that we are unable to understand. Forget language. Actual music.
Like the probability of a car crash making you a sandwich. It makes me think too I bet animals with different audio/visual refresh rates...
The intelligent design of music: tonality &amp; rhythm are the furthest thing from an accident possible.
#SaturdayDeepThoughts If our audio and visual cognitive refresh rate was higher or lower think about how different music would be!
Here's #PickleTheFox if you haven't seen my Instagram lately. It's mainly a fox and vintage synths. http://t.co/XfEJ5AnXTV
Ah the country life. &lt;3 Did I mention how happy I am to watch the sunset on a fall night instead of being in a club? #happyfriday
On conference call, waving my hands emphatically look up to see #PickleTheFox watching like "You crazy. Are you talking to yourself?"
New life goal. 20 minutes of dense, orchestral, electronic score composition per hour. Fully mixed. Finished work. Giving myself a year. Go.
Love you guys. Srsly.  https://t.co/ke54weq4RA
Nice!! https://t.co/jrlPILP7xf
@Roland_US it's my pleasure. Thank you guys for 30 years of awesome
That awkward moment when you just spent 4 hours making 3 loops. #producerproblems

You have no idea how angry birds get in Iceland during mating season! (Sounds incredible though) https://t.co/Q5S5PIOZLp
Wow Paul!! Can't wait to read this. He's such a hero of mine.  https://t.co/dwDQl0i5Vy
Sweet action! https://t.co/6lYsditRqV
And in this process (for me personally) I discover, truly new, formative, fundamental, undiscovered things. That's my why.
A process develops for problem solving minute details and things that in common workflows you take for granted as "the way a system works"
I frequently (in my work) like doing things the absolutely hardest possible way and just realized why. In all that extra work there is..
Get em here!! :  #Stutteredit http://t.co/7QHj22ZYSh #BreakTweaker http://t.co/vmqKc5NuRp
And don't forget #StutterEdit and #BreakTweaker still on special. I'm using both this morning on a big project (to be announced this NAMM!)
