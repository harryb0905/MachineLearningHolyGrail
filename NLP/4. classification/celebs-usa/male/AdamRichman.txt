@kustoo It’s all good, homie. The Watch The Throne 9’s were better, anyway...
The editor(s) on @TrueDetective deserve every bit as much credit as the talented ensemble on screen. The seamless cuts between time periods are executed with surgical precision. Bravo to the unsung heroes of Post-Production. @HBO

@andrewzimmern I don’t disagree. I’m DVR’ing it myself. Just wanted to know what people’s reactions were! It’s always about the performances, anyway - at least for me. Similar to the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies in that way for me.
What do guys think of the Grammy’s? Do you agree or disagree with the winners?
@gardenia073 I literally have no idea what that means. I’m quite sober. Sober enough to make sure you know there are two F’s in “offensive,” and if you’re using an exclamation point, you don’t need a period. I know...learning is hard. I believe in you though.
@ChuckWendig I feel you, SpiderChuck. I just think I know where your heart is you were talking about ketchup &amp; eggs - not Ahab maligning Queequeg on the Pequod.  In short, I respect your respectfulness, yet maintain you were not being disrespectful. Here endeth my catechism.
@gardenia073 Triggered, hon?
@ScottLaPointe @SpursOfficial @ManCity @ChelseaFC You’re a good man &amp; decent human being. Wish there were more like you
@ChuckWendig Oh Chuck. You’re too good of a fellow. “Savage,” much like “freak,” &amp; “beast,” has been in the popular vernacular in a positive vein for some time now. Anyone who has an inkling of the good heart you possess wouldn’t take issue with you using the word in such a benign context.
@ScottLaPointe @SpursOfficial @ManCity @ChelseaFC Thank you. I took the meme to be the opposite. You must understand- the reboot came as a complete shock, was done with my old collaborators unbeknownst to me &amp; Was revealed 2 days before my birthday. It’s a super sore nerve.

@ScottLaPointe @SpursOfficial @ManCity @ChelseaFC I respect the effort, but that is banter gone too far, my man. Take care.

@MrCook2USon It probably sounds like bullshit, but I tried my very first one on the advice of @vdsar1970 , on the coach en route to Socceraid 2014. I must say, I’ve never been very keen on the combination of orange and chocolate. Humblest apologies.... I am sorry. 🍫 🍊 🤷🏻‍♂️

Question: A Genie will grant you either:  - World class musicianship &amp; the chance to join your favorite band? OR - World class athleticism &amp; the chance to play for your favorite sports team.   Which do you choose? What band/team and why?

@pslagowitz @charlotteWoke I’ve always liked Belotti &amp; wanted to see him in a @SpursOfficial shirt. And the World Cup really made me wish we had someone like Wahbi Khazri or Artem Dzyuba.
@OverlordOfMetal @senatemajldr You’re right. I should have insulted him for allowing 800,000 innocent Americans to suffer for 32 days - not his amphibious appearance. 🤦🏻‍♂️ And as for “brining people together,” as long as they are completely submerged and there is enough salt, the meat should be quite tender.

@jaketapper If you have a family history, you can start as young as 35. Adenomas can be found and removed easily during the exam. Catching them early before they have the potential to cause harm is reason enough to go! Endoscopies are important, too! Especially in cases of GERD or Barrett’s.

My cousin is a federal employee. A fearless secret-service agent who has protected two presidents with his life. And as a member of the Secret Service, he can’t take time off despite the shutdown. He’s also a father and a husband. He hasn’t been paid in weeks. I’m disgusted.

@TeleFootball @Carra23 ...I will always respect you, and your accomplishments both on and off the pitch. But reading this, and having to acknowledge that is what you truly believe, just flattened me. We are @SpursOfficial And this is a new day. And as Klopp has reinvigorated The Kop, IN POCH WE TRUST. https://t.co/86htxZFu8w
@TeleFootball @Carra23 ...He believes in. And that’s just it. He has imbued both the team and the supporters with a belief&amp;fervor we haven’t had in a while. And for a legend like you, who was a LOVELY man when I met you, to take a shot at a club’s Renaissance in service of another is heartbreaking...
@TeleFootball @Carra23 ...of other clubs is just awful. Obviously, players and coaches have careers to attend to, and families to provide for. I get that. But there is something to be said for personal investment on both part of gaffer,team,fan base. I believe Poch is building something, something...
@TeleFootball @Carra23 So disappointed, @Carra23  It’s not just because I support @SpursOfficial ,either. The beautiful thing about the game is that it can be in flux-a team nearly relegated can come back and win the league. The idea of that big clubs have to be appeased &amp; “kept big,“ at the expense...

It was the largest increase year-on-year since the beginning of data collection in 1979.  There has been much said about violence committed against other groups, and violence against Jews cannot be ignored.  The hate in this country is sickening.  I PRAY WE CAN FIX IT &amp; SOON!
My stomach churns thinking of the vile, cowardly act committed against my fellow Jews in Pittsburgh today.  Anti-Semitic incidents jumped 57% in 2017, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks anti-Semitic violence in the US.

@stolb8 @hattoncracker No - I said the tone of his responses seemed hostile. Quote me accurately or don’t @ me
@RealJasonWert I agree that being publicly accused-especially if falsely-would bring up feelings of hostility and indignation I cannot imagine - but if I’m trying to convey the image of being even handed &amp; even keeled, I might hold back on that publicly. Honestly the whole thing is so sordid.

I’m no lawyer-what are the rules about a “hostile witness?“   Because the way Kavanagh is responding to some of these questions with these sort of snarky responses, seems pretty damn hostile.
@volcompancake It’s a sad state of affairs isn’t it?
This is Lyndsey Graham’s Oscar clip.  I wonder if all these impassioned speeches would happen if there were no cameras in the room.  I would give anything for a Merrick Garland reaction livestream right now.
It seems to me that an FBI investigation is the only way to go. Durbin is right. Kavanaugh himself used to avail himself of the FBI’s expertise all the time. If he is innocent, they can clear him, if not, we can get some evidence. The rest of this is just talk and grandstanding

If you stand with #GeoffreyOwens &amp; also take issue with his treatment of late, please RT the hell out of my preceding thread.
And I, for one, commend him and applaud him for his performance in perhaps his most important role:  HARDWORKING, DECENT HUMAN BEING.  Bravo, sir. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
#GeoffreyOwens could have given up. Could’ve wallowed in pity, succumbed to a change in fortune.  But instead he went out &amp; handled his business. Put in an honest day’s work. This man should be celebrated, not shamed. An example, not a cautionary tale.
You should tenaciously pursue your dreams,  But you must preserve your well being &amp; the well being of those you love BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. And as a grown-ass man, you need to handle your business. And if that means asking “paper or plastic?” THEN SO BE IT.
He knows, what single moms who work multiple jobs, long hours  &amp; receive meager child support like my mom did, know.  He knows what people who collected unemployment, and lived off of day-old bread and leftover soup like I did, know.
And so now, he may not be as popular, or recognizable as he once was. Perhaps we see his face on camera less than we used to. Perhaps checks from entertainment don’t come in as often as they used to. But will #GeoffreyOwens roll over &amp; die? OF COURSE NOT!!!
I’ve actually been fortunate enough to see him perform live (they used to tape the Cosby Show at Avenue M and E. 14th St. in Brooklyn.) He seemed a decent guy, and a professional through &amp; through. My mother and I both noticed his work ethic, poring over his script between takes.
But can someone who has committed years of their life to pursuing a craft, a passion - just give up, roll over &amp; die because we are waiting by the phone that might not ring as much as it used to? OF COURSE NOT!  #GeoffreyOwens was doing what a man, a RESPONSIBLE man does: HIS JOB
Would we rather be performing? OF COURSE! Would it be easier to have a life that wasn’t dependent upon a network picking up our show, or a director casting us? OF COURSE! Would it be easier if those working in the performing arts had greater financial security? OF COURSE!
And while you see other people in plays, shows &amp; commercials you auditioned your ass off for, LIFE still has its demands. Bills must be paid, people are counting on us, responsibilities must be attended to.
Fellow @yaledrama grad @hwinkler4real told me shortly before I graduated, “You have to be like those inflatable kids’ toys that have the weight at the bottom. They get knocked down &amp; get right back up.” And as everyone who’s ever auditioned knows: THAT SHIT IS NOT EASY TO DO
and 1 million factors out of your control whether or not you will get the role, get the job, and be able to pay your bills with your chosen profession &amp; passion. You have to be vulnerable, yet have the hide of a rhino &amp; above all YOU CANNOT GIVE UP.
Life doesn’t care about your resumé, your reviews, ratings or awards. Life is, as John Lennon said, “what happens while you’re making other plans.” and as talented as you may be, and as many accolades as you may have, it ultimately comes down to a minutes long audition
I worked for an asshole at a gym in my neighborhood signing people up for memberships, washing towels, restocking the beverage machine, and sweeping the sidewalk...With a Yale masters degree, and rehearsing Shakespeare. Because life doesn’t give a damn about your diplomas
I tutored, I was a courier for a company in Marietta, GA, and did a shitload of temp jobs, extra work, and ran a delivery kitchen out of the grotty basement of a sushi place on the Upper West Side that I had to take 3 trains to get to.
Like the beginning of the OG Classic #ManvsFood says: I worked nearly every job in a restaurant there is: washed dishes, bussed tables, waited tables everywhere from @redrobinburgers to @SUSHISAMBA ,hosted at a steakhouse in Atlanta, worked in catering kitchens from NY to CA
acting gigs, I would work at least 3 jobs at a time to make ends meet...I did so for many years, up to and during the filming of the Man vs Food pilot and pitch reel- I actually had orientation for a new job @TheGarden the day of my final #ManVersusFood screen test. Bible truth.
THREAD On #GeoffreyOwens bagging groceries &amp; the vile treatment he’s endured: I’m a proud member of @sagaftra @ @ActorsEquity When I began my performing career in 1996, I worked SEVERAL “survival” jobs. Coming out of @yaledrama in 2003, even with higher paying, though sporadic

@i_AshleyKate I’m not in England.
@failedspinster No! Clearly raised in the proper manner
@MikeGibson90 @SpursOfficial @LedleyKing @DarrenAnderton Oh thanks Mike - always knew I was your fave
@yidarmyterry @SpursOfficial @LedleyKing @DarrenAnderton LOL. That’s cold. Looks a little like Fazio or Stambouli!
@gominnesotawild @SpursOfficial @LedleyKing @DarrenAnderton @MNSpurs @walkerartcenter @IntChampionsCup How did you guys get the blue cockerel up there?
In honor of @SpursOfficial ‘s win today, i’m sharing this special moment meeting not one, but two Spurs legends - @LedleyKing @DarrenAnderton https://t.co/e6iKwPPH3W
So much love to @awkwafina for: “NYC Bitche$” - and not just cuz you filmed part of the video 2 blocks from my damn house!  Bless up. So hyped to dig through the catalogue now. Dinner on me in Brooklyn, yo! https://t.co/M0BooEW0Qs
Kind of knew of @awkwafina from acting stuff, but never listened to her music til yesterday. I have been such a fool. Like @MosDefOfficial ‘s “Brooklyn,” or @S_C_ &amp; @aliciakeys “Empire State of Mind,” there’s something so dope about an NY anthem from someone that’s from there...
A little shot of unbridled joy for ya. G’mornin. Enjoy, @Lin_Manuel https://t.co/AlrwXufdSU
@DeliFreshThrds @MaitlandWard @theCHIVE @NPRFood @seriouseats @TwitterFood @BuzzFeedFood Crazy - I’m wearing the same outfit right now
@JeffMachia @Babchik Thank you both. Much love

@Lin_Manuel And to the great unfinished books, scripts, songs inside of us that demand we get in the trenches, marching on to the cadence of creation.

That man right there &amp; “Good Eats,” were among my biggest ever inspirations. Plus, he gave acting gigs to a lot of my friends in Atlanta! Had to step my game up! @altonbrown https://t.co/RCSjwE0kgN

I truly needed some decency &amp; love after the day I’ve had. This is just wonderful. No - you’re crying.... https://t.co/Ii4VBUZY5G
@MarkJVieira Right. It’s known perhaps in the industry, but that’s a recent development, relatively speaking. Lived in Atlanta almost 7 years - TV &amp; film were not big then.
@spursyyank No, man. To quote Ye, “when in doubt, don’t.”
@boase2016 I think whenever you go somewhere where people have very limited means, and they share what little they have with you, it is DEEPLY humbling - both in the US &amp; abroad.
@rishitibrewal @SpursOfficial Mad love, Rishi #TTID
@Leemorr23 @SpursOfficial Cockerel around my neck 24/7 ! #COYS
@spursyyank Did I do either?
Dude - I’m still freaking out I met YOU! Had to work up the nerve to say hello! https://t.co/NExvcySRGL
And I’m not hating on Waka at all, but one of his best quotes was: “First Atlanta was known for sports,  music, movies (?) and now soccer.” Isn’t soccer a sport, though?   Plus they’ve asked the same “What do you think about the way this city has adopted this sport?” 100 times!
The coverage of this #MLSAllStar Game has got to be the weirdest I’ve ever seen. First, the goalie is not only mic’d but is actually conversing with the commentators WHILE PLAYING. Then, they seek commentary from football expert (I shit you not, Waka Flocka Flame)
The beginning of what was to become an epic night. Great times with my @stillhouseusa fam, and linking up with my man, @g_eazy . The show was LIT!!! Much success on the rest of the tour my guy!

@MikeAcosta11 Addendum: Golovin &amp; Wahbi Khazri
@davejmorrissey I need to make that Noel Gallagher money, first before anyone at any club would listen to me. If me talking to my mates at the club did anything we’d have signed De Bruyne, Honda, Halilovic, Inui, Dybala (back at Palermo days) - I think Golovin was en fuego at the World Cup
@kustoo @tldtoday You always drop such fire kicks, at first glance I thought you were debuting an Apple shoe! #iDrop
@AllisonJaneSmi2 Absolutely!
@natecancook @rich_chandler Ouch. Please don’t. You’ve a lovely noggin.
@MikeAcosta11 At this point, it’s more of who I would not have let go through the years. Bale, Defoe, Sigurdsson, Van de Vaart, even Holtby. Nobody could’ve predicted Paulinho would remember how to play again with Barça, right? Like everyone, I like the idea of Zaha, Sessegnon, Martial...

@axiola Try again:  “ it seems to me that low-key no one knows why they are saying it.“
@SufcLee Wait - did I fuck up? Wasn’t he at Hull before Wigan?
🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/HVuEqNRAIW
@ChrsCllwy I fully admit it. I love the game enough to find something enjoyable to appreciate in pretty much every match I see. And because a lot of the guys that played today, don’t normally play, I always enjoy that as well.
@ghs_1986 You don’t think there was a lot of skill on display?
@axiola OMFG. Why👏🏼Do👏🏼You👏🏼Care?
Secretly hoping @jimmykimmel does one of his awesome street interview segments asking random Americans on the street to pronounce, “JANUZAJ” https://t.co/c1ltLcspgN
Harry Maguire is low key impressing me in every single game. Win or lose. Come so far from Hull City days. Even if both England and Belgium are not using their main starting players, it still is a beautiful game to watch. #ENGvBEL #2018FIFAWorldCup
@RickSpur Never should’ve let him go
@smooney_74 https://t.co/0zVpmJzfQ4
@smooney_74 All I found was an article about this vile Anti-Semitic shitstain named Thomas Lopez Pierre who volunteered for her. She denounced him on her account.  Israel is a harder subject &amp; I honestly know I’m far too biased to opine publicly. I’m a proud Jew &amp; I love &amp; respect Israel.
@smooney_74 I never knew that! Really???? I am so truly gobsmacked!  Can you shoot me a link?

@DevBo_88 And I used to live in San Jose! At 3rd and San Fernando!  I love guys who play physical ball, but that was damn near assault! Mad love to @burritozilla @HenrysHilife &amp; of course @SJRep

@itsdonaile @DrDZaster Sensitivity and insulting me are not one and the same. Good luck to you.
@itsdonaile @DrDZaster Obviously not. You need a hug and a warm cup of Bovril?
@MusoCraig Hahaha. Got ya. Did you not see how rough they were playing? Or the record number of fouls on Neymar?
@TomLievers Right?
@daya2812 Almost as sad as you not being able to disassociate A comment about a particular football player, with criticism of the whole country. Grow up.
@MusoCraig Like a bad pencil sharpener, you have missed the point. It was a commentary on violent play
@itsdonaile Think for a minute.... Did I insult the country or the awful standard of play from the national team? The tweet is like a puddle, ITS NOT THAT DEEP. AND YOU CAN GET OVER IT.
@BestMusicLyric I remember when that concert was listed in my issue of Rolling Stone!

D-E-spicable spelling error!
@_wbrodrigues I know! Did Mark Clattenberg have Secret clones?

@VivaDunnVegas Mazel Tov, Raffi!
@briankoppelman Needed this reminder. Can’t wait to meet up!
@TheSpursReview I agree. But as someone suggested, what if Messi dropped back as CAM?
@ebenirigo I was thinking that
@LaModernLepra And thank you for stating the obvious. I’m aware of that. But a three-pronged attack has proven valuable multiple times as evidenced recently by Barcelona‘s MSN. Or France with Griezmann, Mbappe &amp; Dembele
Follow up:  why wouldn’t Argentina play all of its amazing strikers as a three-pronged assault upfront? Dybala, Messi, Aguero &amp; use Higuain as a sub?
@JORDANJMA Tell that to get to the guy who just got kicked in the head

I completely agree. All I was saying is, the nice thing about the World Cup is that we get to see players with potential from all over that should be on our radar https://t.co/epKo7w4V6h
@biggy85 @SpursOfficial I’m just saying I hope these players are on their radar. People get way too in their feelings about soccer tweets.
@Fr8styAK @SpursOfficial Yes! Are we getting the call up?
@Davatron @SpursOfficial Not disagreeing with you, The defense and link-up play were terrible and the Russian counterattack was usually pretty fast and aggressive. But that doesn’t change the abilities of those two men.
@rossinaylor @SpursOfficial Other than the overt racism in your stupid tweet, The idea that because I have a certain job, I don’t understand the sport, is as moronic as you are.
Man, I hope @SpursOfficial are watching this Russian team! Cheryshev &amp; Golovin are a LOT of fun to watch.  Would look very good with Cockerels on their chests!
I used to drive my friends in my mom’s car, into the city to catch this man at the Boston Comedy Club back in the day. Dave Chappelle was always funny, and nice to my friends and I.

@EllyHallLykAye And you’re an insult to anyone who breathes air. It’s airport policy, you worthless dick. If I can’t walk, that’s how they get me to my gate bec I can’t use crutches &amp; carry a bag - a fact that would be obvious if you didn’t have horseshit where your brain should be. 🖕🏼🖕🏼

@AlaskaAir Thank you Samantha. Appreciate your reply. The copious amounts of time spent at bag claim before I was even told about my bag, by someone who knew of the delay before I even landed, cost me my rental car class, and yes, 1/8 of my bday. You guys need to see there’s a ripple effect
@AlaskaAir Just wanted to say, thanks for doing such an epic job of ruining my birthday &amp; losing one of my bags. 2 checked simultaneously, but only 1 makes it? Keep me in airport for hours? WTF? Y’all should be ashamed.  NEVER EVER AGAIN. Watch this space. I’m not done with you.

"Honored to be part of opening of the Edgewood, PA @getgo! Such a fantastic day. Met cool local influencers, had a 14 ft(!) sub-cutting ceremony, &amp; watched a sandwich making contest between police depts!

@TopRopeElbow Never got to film at Willie Maes, next time you go back you got to try the other places beach filmed on #SecretEatsWithAdamRichman &amp; ya gotta hit Borgne with @chefbrianlandry !
@tmpwyatt @RickSpur I’m with you. I understand it’s a draw to get these big names but they have to deliver the goods. Getting him &amp; losing Sigurdsson, Holtby, Paulinho, Defoe let alone Modric &amp; Bale just ain’t right
I’m guessing it’s penis &amp; testicles. https://t.co/55e7LZAZ2D
@RickSpur And that is A-OK! 👌🏼  I loved El Rey Leon at Bilbao, was so psyched we signed him, but he’s been as effective as a screen door on a submarine. Can you imagine if we saved the money on him, Janssen &amp; Soldado💩 ?
@JamesSmith_91 Love ya, James.
@xDuoMax I’m giving you the biggest high five right now
Pardon me, @SpursOfficial - might you be a dear &amp; sign Alen Halilovic when you have a moment?  Cheers, thanks!

@JG_1408 @HKane In a dream world, someone like Benzema
@Kerr_Ramsay @HKane The list will exceed Twitter’s character limit, but personally-the season that Leicester won, I think if we had kept Jermaine Defoe, things could have been very different. Felt we missed out on Remy, Austin &amp; Honda even RVP before he left the Prem.
@NewYorkFoxes @AtKiCo In California watching my @SpursOfficial - I’m nowhere near and I’m way better looking than that guy 😜

Being in a hospital, even for a quick visit, underlines one incontrovertible fact:  HEALTH IS WEALTH.  Live your best life y’all. It’s the only one you get.
I’m just gonna leave this right here:  All burgers should come with a choice of fries, rings &amp; tots.  Bonus points if you have the choice of seasoned, waffle or curly.
@chopperhontas @UKToyCollector That’s really, really kind
@BrettSBaker @rustyrockets You never saw my complete final wing! I ate mine &amp; @seanseaevans ‘s wing too! With an extra dab!
@JTMann05 Civil discourse can occur when you state things in a civil way. I don’t know you, but for a “correspondent,” you traffic in inflammatory, polemic posts that will alienate and anger people. Don’t throw gas on a fire &amp; wonder why it blows up on you. You reap what you sow.

HM Son won’t ever need to eat again because he’s making a meal of Barzagli. I’m really hating that lump today #TOTJUV
@LastWordOnSpurs @RickSpur Agreed. 100% Off the pitch, team &amp; planet.
@Sam_J_Burgess Yes, I’m busy pulling what’s left of my hair out
@nickjfrost I miss you, my man.
@StarSumiaki Done!
@Sam_J_Burgess When can you start??
@newportstu @SpursOfficial Too busy doing my happy dance!!! https://t.co/YBocN6d1xa
@gallott1985 Where in FL?
That is a sick job title. Can I be Minister of Poppin Bottles &amp; Chancellor of Booty Poppin? https://t.co/fDH1rR88tL
1-0 !!! #COYS @SpursOfficial  #TOTJUV
@scottstevenson_ Too right!!!  “Not my Sonny, he’s a good boy!”
@Slappie I agree-that’s why I felt he should have fallen when initial contact was made instead of trying to run and then falling
@DaithiMolloy Lol. Legit - LOL
@scottstevenson_ Yeah - I guess. Brought to you by the department of Double Standards
@fads007 Homie, there’s no way if some Big oaf was standing on your knee you wouldn’t have wanted to kick his soul out of his ass
@europasaintsfc @paul_lomas He is quite tall, that’s true
@scottwilson1984 I’d love to see it too! Even on pay per view. Blaise Matuidi sounds like I’m asking you to burn an old Sportcoat of mine...
@RLBeaumont17 I don’t disagree
Oh FFS, can someone just put Barzagli to sleep, please?  What a cheap, shitty way to play. HM Son should have kicked his nuts off. Dirty, dirty, dirty.... #TOTJUV
@Niall_bryant @Serge_aurier Awful human being...
@Ccurley0Carol I fucking hate when people say that stupid shit to me. Disagree with me if you want, that’s your right, but I’m a human being and I can talk about whatever the hell I want. DEAL. WITH. IT. https://t.co/6eSZ4TqARI
@steph_oc84 Well I’m sure “Andy” is glad you still like him.... #SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️
@sizzlingal22 @Serge_aurier Thanks, Dude
@Baz_crack @Serge_aurier Was that Sanchez who tackled him? My bad
We just need to keep running at Juve’s back line. Chiellini is gonna get tired AF. Hopefully Matuidi gets knocked TF out by Dembele or Dier... #TOTJUV
Costa, get the fuck up. If you want to dive to draw the penalty, at least make a convincing!   On another note - If we don’t get as precise as Juve, we are in trouble. #UCL #TOTJUV

Own this: The person that gives you grief in one way or another, The one who’s judgy, critical, snide, passive-aggressive, abrasive, dismissive or just a plain ol’ dickhead-  NONE OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.  You are awesome. You are aces. Just smile &amp; own the truth. 🏆

@GregScottTV I’m trying to think of my own answer!  Maybe 400m Fondue Freestyle?  Shawl neck sweater downhill?  The skiing &amp; rifle one but more with a Hunger Games twist?  I like that snowboard Mortal Kombat downhill one too! When it’s just a free for all melee of guys in dope outerwear?

@jakewoolf @ExtraButter You’re my maven, Legend. I do trust you. Vapormax is stiffer somehow, so it doesn’t flop over like a Love handle!
@jakewoolf @LendseyT If I had a narrow foot I would rock these &amp; Roche’s
@jakewoolf They’ve never been my Steez. Not the 350’s either. Plus my huge feet under the stretchy fabric make em look wack.  I’m a King Push, Vapormax, Air Max 1&amp;90 guy for runners. Hon mention: @ExtraButter DeathSquad Asics

I’ll never understand people who need to cause drama. There’s enough darkness &amp; nonsense in the world without people causing more for kicks, getting more followers, or click bait.  I may not always be perfect, but I sure as hell am gonna try to put as much love out there as I can
@nauticalstar Well the shows were kind of rolled out over time, and some of these shows were originally released as “man finds food,” but now The amazing people at @CookingChannel are really giving #SecretEatsWithAdamRichman a proper showcase, and the crew and I couldn’t be happier!
@diamond214904 Welcome back! I really appreciate your kind message!
@WinnardJack Thanks Jack. Hopefully you will catch my new show #SecretEatsWithAdamRichman on @CookingChannel This coming Tuesday at 10 PM
Please do! Independent restaurants need all the help they can get! And these are some of the very best! https://t.co/WNXYwf1AFa
It’s cold, it’s wet, and it’s grey out.  But you keep moving forward. You keep grinding. Keep getting the job done. Consistently handling your business.  Because excellence knows no temperature.  I see you, Champion.  And I think you’re awesome. Hope you do too. 🏆
MON THE BROADLEY! Hope we’ve done ya proud, RB. #RestInPower https://t.co/WkFi0xhpEk

Are you watching #SecretEats on @CookingChannel in Philly right now???  because you should be!
@aiflores Nope! All the same show-but sadly there were some folks in charge who wanted to show the crew less which was a bummer. The episodes featuring the crew are my favorite #SecretEatsWithAdamRichman
#SecretEatsWithAdamRichman is now in #Philadelphia!   Donuts, fried chicken, burgers with Fried beer wontons on them and Chili Frito pie! Off the menu and off the chain!!
This chef Wanda (pronounced “Vanda”) was one of the sweetest human beings I’ve ever met. Without any common language other than food and body language and, of course, respect-we had so much fun together! https://t.co/dY2ntBxuE4
Old Town #Warsaw is easily one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been in my life.  Now check out this sick restaurant inside an apartment! https://t.co/uxvrDgEyg1

@brenaldinho LMFAO😂😂
Amidst all the noise and strife of the day, I felt a tiny spark of joy to see that my iPhone dictation recognized “Shaq.“
@scottyp1982 I believe so! Some episodes have aired in the UK as “man finds food,“ but I don’t believe you have seen all the episodes, and now, the whole series is called #SecretEatsWithAdamRichman
If you do, may I pay you to make me one as well? 🙏🏼 https://t.co/WWMzIwxFPu

Thank you for posting this, Laura. Jim was sweet, deeply humble and was deeply beloved by my Dad and I for years.  And “Goooo-lllllly” I was glad to have had the chance to meet him and tell him so. Rest In Peace, sir. https://t.co/F86HZQl9io
Even if you don’t know it yet, Today is YOUR day.  Get out there and own that shit.  We’re all rooting for ya!
I see you out there... Doing your day... Grinding your grind... And I gotta tell you...  You’re absolutely crushing it. You’re a beast,  a Jedi,  a Zen Master.  Keep on keeping on, you Legend.  Every little thing, is gonna be alright.

@aidiaz24 @_superhans Over time? I’d safely say thousands. Plus Ive been working with @TasteoftheNFL  &amp; @food4thehungry for some time now. And you, Miss “I missed the whole damn point entirely,” What have you given besides grief, cluelessness and big mouth? #SitDown #BeHumble
Just donated. Blessings and love to you &amp; your family, Jay. https://t.co/T2VepgcfiI

So funny how people get all in their feelings over a few characters in cyberspace.   “There is a world elsewhere.”  - Coriolanus
@crethar81 @_superhans Riiiiight. Because there’s some connection between food eaten on a show filmed 9 years ago and the pandemic of world hunger. Were your parents brother &amp; sister?  😂😂🖕🏼 #Idiots

@PiBBzYx I feel you. I agree the politeness or lack of it knows no age. I was merely addressing people who claim to be all about good yet can’t be kind.
@PawterPanda Lol. First, thank you for taking time out of your schedule to google my birthday. Hope that was fun. “Sir” has nothing to do with age. “Sir” is a matter of politeness-you should look into it
@leshoad If I ever forgot please or thank you, my mom and her ridiculously quick right cross would have something to say about that
@buchanan_cait Certainly not trying to indict a whole generation. Sorry if you took it that way. Merely pointing out the hypocrisy of those that claim to be on the side of good, yet can’t be kind to their fellow man
Millennials will talk all this shit about being “woke,” and “micro aggressions” - but can’t say “sir” or “ma’am” or even “excuse me” when they bump into you. Seriously? https://t.co/LNFgxXuvTQ

@nelward64 @SiameseDeluxe @Pringles Why would you think that, Nelward?
@burgerjunkies @eatgordaeat @CeeElCee I agree. And I appreciate your words. The idea that weight affects my actions is absurd. And one misstep does not a human make
@eatgordaeat @burgerjunkies @CeeElCee We’ve never once interacted. I don’t see how you can say such a thing, or why you would. Not very kind or fair.

Thought: They need to create a roll-up ketchup/Sriracha bottle so you can get the very last bit - like a toothpaste tube...
I'll never understand people who are inconsiderate in every way &amp; have no basic courtesy, yet get so offended at the smallest swear word.SMH

@MatthewWheat_ @Nick90_THFC @thfc1983 @SpursOfficial @FinnBalor @KelvinBeachumJr Fuckem. If we don't get involved in the game, we are foolish-if we do get involved in the game, people criticize the way we support. #SMH
@M3rcury78 Hope you heal quickly!
@thfc1983 @SpursOfficial @FinnBalor @KelvinBeachumJr I just hope you know that I love how much my love for Spurs upsets you &amp; those like you. 6+yrs of unwaivering support outweigh 1 tweet #COYS
@Nick90_THFC @thfc1983 @SpursOfficial @FinnBalor @KelvinBeachumJr Don't believe that moron. You want facts ask me. You want shit, go to an asshole, dude.
@thfc1983 @Nick90_THFC @SpursOfficial @FinnBalor @KelvinBeachumJr And I mentioned Pogrebnyak as it pertained to Dempsey's trade from Fulham because they played well together. Never mistook him for Pav, dick
@thfc1983 @Nick90_THFC @SpursOfficial @FinnBalor @KelvinBeachumJr Dude. Give it a rest. I did not. You're not even accurately quoting a 7 YEAR OLD TWEET. Grow up &amp; move the fuck on. #TTID Deal with it.
@LedleyTHFC @SpursOfficial @FinnBalor @KelvinBeachumJr Thank you, pal. My cousin was even giving me grief for how much I spend to see @SpursOfficial every chance I get! #COYS
You bet! @MiamiDolphins to the core. https://t.co/KIhSnHxxh6
