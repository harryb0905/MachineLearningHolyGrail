I’ve waited too long to vote YES on basic gun safety bills.   I will proudly do so this week.   Trump’s veto threat shows that he stands with gun corporations over the American people who broadly support background checks and don’t have a corrupt view of 2A.
I remember that day, shortly after Parkland. President Trump told a small group of Members of Congress that Republican senators who were standing in the way of common-sense gun safety laws were afraid of the NRA.   Today?  Donald Trump is afraid. https://t.co/rk8R0hupqX
The Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act will add funding and expand access to entrepreneurship training. https://t.co/X8S6BjcIWO
Proud to vote for expansion of the @NSF I-Corps program. Last year, I visited the @FAUTechRunway to celebrate I-Corp funding that will help FAU researchers break out of the lab and into the market.
The Trump Administration pretends that the option to buy a gun online without a background check is the only thing preserving the 2nd Amendment.   That is a dangerous, extremist position. https://t.co/F8Chsnof9B
Should we “do something” to stop 40,000 gun deaths per year?  Yes.   Can we have gun rights at the same time we have strong &amp; effective gun safety laws?  Yes.   Will @dloesch do everything she can to stop change that will save lives?  Sadly, yes.
The House will finally take action toward peace this week.   Looking forward to casting my vote in favor of universal background checks on all gun sales. #HR8 https://t.co/obcnRby96a
Background checks are bipartisan and necessary. This week the House will vote on implementing universal background checks and I am proud to say that I will be voting YES. #HR8
Returning democracy to the hands of the people means getting big money out of our system. I joined a discussion on this issue at the Pine Crest School Symposium this morning and I am confident that we can defeat big money and fix the damage Citizens United has done. https://t.co/ACMWvvuZeo
Glad to see UK finally acknowledging what we’ve been saying for years: there’s no distinguishing between Hezbollah political &amp; military wings. It’s a terrorist group. All of it. https://t.co/7HNekeA5Ef
After Pulse we shut down the House floor to demand action on gun violence.   After Parkland we marched to demand action on gun violence.   This week, we will vote to require background checks on all gun sales.   I’m voting YES on #HR8

Allowing gun sales without background checks has deadly consequences.   In Charleston.   In Sutherland Springs.   In Aurora.   We’ve got to give law enforcement the time and the tools to conduct background checks &amp; prevent prohibited sales. https://t.co/Ah2TQXQji4
Law enforcement understands the importance of making animal cruelty a law. In one survey, 71% of domestic violence victims said their abuser also attacked their pets. The FBI now tracks animal abuse cases in their criminal database.  That's why the @GLFOP supports the #PACTAct. https://t.co/Snk9rS3VVZ
The U.S. must stand w/ the Venezuelan people and their right to a democracy &amp; against the Maduro regime that created this awful humanitarian crisis.  We must also extend protected status for those Venezuelans in our communities yet facing deportation. https://t.co/GxZih67nfV

Just a friendly reminder that @realdonaldtrump openly admitted that he didn’t need to declare a national emergency.  I’m sure the 16 states suing the administration took note.
Shortly I’ll be joining @MSNBC  @HallieJackson to discuss big issues, including the crisis in Venezuela.
Five dead in Aurora.  I’m so so sorry.
If we can reduce gun violence by raising the minimum age a person can buy a shotgun or rifle, then we should do exactly that. I am proud to introduce legislation that raises the minimum age to 21. We can save lives.
An assault weapons ban shouldn’t be controversial. Weapons of war shouldn’t be in the hands of ordinary citizens. I support @RepCicilline in the introduction of an assault weapons ban. This is just common sense.
I’m horrified by the news out of Aurora. I’m grateful for the first responders. And I am praying that this terrible news not get even worse as more information comes out.  https://t.co/G42T6HTnNu
A year ago we were told the gun lobby controlled what happened in Washington, so change wouldn’t come.  #MSDStrong rejected that notion.   The student activists marched, mobilized, and inspired a movement that impacted the election.  Change is moving forward. https://t.co/FIhMiaBWTJ
President Trump would rather steal money from our military, which actually fights national security threats, for his made-up national emergency.   He said those military funds “didn’t sound too important to me.”  Even more evidence that this is nothing more than a political ploy.
Not a national emergency: our southern border   A real national emergency: 40,000 American deaths/year from gun violence  A real national emergency: climate change  Stealing money from our military &amp; hurricane recovery efforts is cruel. And it’s unconstitutional.
President Trump’s emergency declaration is a farce &amp; his wall is about vanity not security. https://t.co/QsAPkcQeqq
In 2016, American voters sent Republican majorities to both the House and Senate. They wouldn’t give Trump his wall.   In 2018, voters elected Dem majority in the House &amp; Rs kept control of the Senate. Neither voted to give Trump his wall.
https://t.co/2HK9heciB2
.@RealDonaldTrump, last week you offered to meet with the Parkland parents to discuss your response to the national emergency of gun violence that spread to their school and claimed their children one year ago yesterday.   I offered to arrange it. The offer still stands.
This is why we need a Special Envoy who will lead American efforts to combat anti-Semitism abroad. Elan Carr has an important responsibility, but I’m confident he will work tirelessly to address this scourge around the world. https://t.co/AIaekD5EOr
I will never forget the conversations, hugs, tears, and smiles that I shared with students and Parkland families today. We must all remember that on this day, and every day, we are not alone.   We are #MSDStrong. https://t.co/VGtFzhAnNf
Tonight, after a long day of community healing and service events, we all gathered together to pray for the 17 lives that were taken from us one year ago today and which we will never forget.  #MSDStrong https://t.co/Xm6hgHe04v

“I went to the cemetery on Sunday. The first place I went to was Meadow. I just got out of the car, and I lost it. I was ugly crying. I apologized for what happened to her. I told Jaime that my daughter dedicated her competitive dances to her.” - Sarah Lerner, MSD English Teacher
“We have a lot of sad moments that we keep for ourselves... I sometimes find myself lost in life. And then I end up understanding that my son is not going to be back — as much as I cry, that’s not going to be happen.” - Manuel Oliver, Joaquin Oliver’s father.
“I’m wearing [Joaquin’s] sweatshirt. I wear it all the time... He said, ‘I hope you know you’re not my girlfriend. You’re my soul mate.’ I know I’m just a kid &amp; kids don’t know any better but that was the purest form of love there is.” - Tori Gonzalez, 18
“I left college because you have to choose what’s more important. I want to use may talents and abilities to change the world somehow.” - Jammal Lemy, 21
“It helped me, having conversations with kids and teachers (at a day of healing in the park for emergency medical workers and families) that I couldn’t have in the building.” - Captain Brad Mock
“Not a single day goes by that you don’t think about some aspect of that day.” - Lieutenant Nicholas Mazzei
“For college, I want to go to Ireland, where my parents are from, because I just don’t want to do four more years of schooling here. I really don’t like how divided this country is. In Ireland, there’s no guns.” - Anna Crean, 16
“The best moment for me was when I was able to walk by myself... I walked into a room and my grandpa and my grandma and my mom and dad were there, and they burst out crying.” - Anthony Borges, 16
They did not want to relive that day...argue about politics... or talk about the gunman’s pending trial...  They wanted to mourn.   Please take a moment to read the words of Parkland survivors.  https://t.co/N26yxD4fG9

Misogyny turns deadly in Isla Vista streets.   President Trump’s failure to address gun violence directly is a grave disappointment. We will not stop fighting for a #SOTU2EndGunViolence
Failure to address gun violence means all forms of hate are more deadly.   Antisemitism turns deadly in a Pittsburgh synagogue.   Racism turns deadly in a Charleston bible study.   Domestic violence turns deadly in a Texas sanctuary.

To combat the scourge of anti-Semitism, we must never hesitate to call it out wherever and whenever it occurs.
Agreed, we cannot avert attention from the Iranian threat. We also shouldn’t divert resources from efforts against Iran’s destabilizing actions. Pulling the US from Syria creates a vacuum that Iran &amp; its terror proxies will try to fill, giving them a foothold on Israel’s border.

Americans are in rare agreement.  97% want background checks on every gun sale.  What about gun owners?  97% want background checks on every gun sale.  Why? Bc they already do them when they buy from stores.  Why let people who aren’t responsible easily get guns online w/o a ✅?
Going after gangs is and will remain a priority for our law enforcement. But comparing families fleeing violence and seeking asylum to horrific criminals like MS-13 is cruel, unfair, and wrong. #SOTU
Anyone listening to @POTUS talk about the border can tell he’s overselling it. Listen to the experts. There are parts of the border where barriers make sense. Trump needs to stop wall talk and start real talk. Let’s find good policy and stop making this about politics. #SOTU
Democrats have a real plan to secure our southern border. We can use advanced technology, enhanced personnel, and screening at ports of entry to achieve far more than Trump’s useless wall ever would. #SOTU

I’m honored to Chair the @HouseForeign Subcmte on Middle East, North Africa, &amp; Int’l Terrorism.   This region is vital to our national security and global stability. On this panel we will lead Congress in standing firmly with our allies and boldly against our enemies. https://t.co/Jc1yUGV5T7
Thank you, @RepCarbajal! Everyone in Congress should support the effort to #ProtectOurPets. https://t.co/EA5AmWYv08
Some issues aren’t partisan, even in Washington. One of those issues is protecting our animals. The #PACTAct is designed to #ProtectOurPets and I am proud to be fighting for that cause.
This is my dog Jessie. She fully supports the PACT Act because she believes that animals deserve protection.   Is it possible to disagree with a dog this cute? https://t.co/HoRUlNTcNg
Acting AG Whittaker, a known Mueller critic, claims that the Mueller investigation is wrapping up.   I think we will allow Mueller to let us know when he is done.
Thrilled to start the Democratic majority on @HouseJudiciary with HR1.  HR1 will repair the foundations of our democracy #ForThePeople by: • making it easier to vote,  • getting money out of politics, and  • strengthening ethics rules for all 3 branches of government. https://t.co/T0MkzH2Cpj
Stopping animal cruelty is important to Americans across the country and folks are surprised when they hear that abusing an animal is NOT a federal crime.   I introduced the PACT Act with @VernBuchanan to change that.   It’s time to protect our animals.   https://t.co/iFrn4ubuRR
This is one week in America.   A very normal, unacceptable week filled with gun violence.   Strong gun laws work. It’s time to take action.   https://t.co/JjC8Nc1PZF

I woke up to Alexa singing happy birthday to my wife. Pretty good voice, actually, but still a little creepy.
I’m grateful that federal workers will finally go back to work and receive their overdue paychecks.   They don’t deserve to be political pawns. They deserve our respect for their hard work for our nation. And they certainly deserve a peaceful weekend now that this is over.
Air traffic controllers received their second paycheck of $0.00 today.  More Americans are feeling the pinch as their flights are delayed or even canceled.  What will it take for the President to end the pain of this shutdown and reopen the government?  https://t.co/4Muz3KtjEe
Heard from a US Marshal who tracks child predators. He’s working every day to catch terrible people who prey on our kids. And he’s not getting paid.   President Trump, #EndTheShutdown.
Stone tells Trump Campaign about hacked emails held by WikiLeaks.   WikiLeaks releases hacked emails.   Senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about more damaging documents.   Stone told the campaign about future releases.   Not a witch hunt. https://t.co/rDV4E5lwTF

Federal workers are struggling to feed their families. Yet our Commerce Secretary doesn’t understand why they don’t just take out loans to cover the paychecks they aren’t receiving because of the President’s shutdown.   https://t.co/bFGLtky6as
These 800,000 workers &amp; their families didn’t ask for this shutdown.   They didn’t choose to be furloughed. They don’t want to be working for free.  Unfortunately, they are sacrificing so much for President Trump’s political stunt. But not by choice, and not for any greater good.
Lara Trump thinks a month w/o pay is just “a little bit of pain” and that these employees’ children “will thank them for their sacrifice.  Maybe you should ask them how they feel about sacrificing a full month’s pay for President Trump’s political stunt.  https://t.co/HGamb5RydB
Tomorrow, workers from TSA, Coast Guard, CBP, and other agencies will NOT receive paychecks for the SECOND time.  Many are struggling with bills, mortgage payments, medical bills, education costs.  Ask them if this feels like just “a little bit of pain.”  https://t.co/HGamb69959
800,000 workers &amp; their families are struggling to make ends meet.   I support legislation to bring relief to these families &amp; protect them from foreclosures, evictions, &amp; loan defaults.   Will the President have the decency to help the people his shutdown is hurting every day?
Venezuelans have long suffered under Maduro’s ruthless control that has devastated their economy, used deadly violence against civilians, and sent millions fleeing. Congress stands firmly with the Venezuelan people.

I am proud that the late Aaron Feis was nominated to be the Don Shula NFL High School Coach of the Year. Aaron was the coach of South Florida’s own Stoneman Douglas that lost his life in the MSD shooting last year and I can’t think of anyone more deserving to receive this honor.
In the 115th Congress there was overwhelming support for legislation protecting animals from abuse, but it never received a vote. Today, I reintroduced the PACT Act with @VernBuchanan and we will get this done. It’s bipartisan, common-sense policy that will protect our animals.

I’ve heard from furloughed aviation safety inspectors who want to return to work; one woman can’t pay her medication copays for her cancer treatment. Congress must reopen the government and end the pain of this shutdown.
Air traffic controllers, TSA agents, food and drug inspectors, and many other federal employees who keep Americans safe daily are working without pay.
The government shutdown is directly &amp; severely harming 800,000 people. Individuals are falling behind bills and families are unable to cover healthcare costs because their last paycheck was $0.00. The shutdown is also affecting millions of Americans, directly and indirectly.
Martin Luther King jr. left behind a legacy that will never be forgotten. He led a movement for equality that helped strengthen the basic civil rights that every person deserves. His work is unfinished and on this #MLKDAY we should recommit to continuing the fight. https://t.co/aB4LsLvjEb
.@SenRickScott @marcorubio have you met with any of your constituents who are out of work or working without pay &amp; struggling because of the shutdown?   They need your help to demand Mitch McConnell hold a vote to open the government.

William Barr sent a 19-page memo arguing against potential obstruction of justice charges to Trump’s personal defense lawyers and Jared Kushner’s defense team.   If DOJ ethics lawyers recommend his recusal based on these facts, Barr should commit to following their guidance.
https://t.co/ELazv8yY3o
William Barr is saying the right things about Mueller TODAY, but Senators shouldn’t ignore potential conflicts raised by his unsolicited memo to Trump’s defense team on obstruction of justice.   To remove shadow over his appointment, he must follow DOJ ethics recommendations.
https://t.co/1eJ0AckhkQ
DOJ ethics lawyers often review potential conflicts of interest &amp; recommend recusal if needed.   Usually, their advice is followed.   Acting AG Whitaker didn’t follow advice to recuse from the Mueller probe.   If confirmed, is Barr committed to following ethics recommendations?
Barr’s nomination to be the next AG means he will have total control over the Mueller investigation. He has pledged transparency and fairness, but his records indicate otherwise. Actions speak louder than words.
800,000 federal workers missed paychecks because of the #TrumpShutdown, incl. civil servants who keep our country safe.  @HouseDemocrats have passed bills to reopen the government; we're still waiting for Senate Republicans and the President to act.

Great piece by @BnaiBrith &amp; @NCSEJ on urgent need to appoint a special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, which this Admin. has left vacant for 2 years. The US must lead the global charge against anti-Semitism. The House just passed a bill to elevate the role. https://t.co/lcZYkIibsW
We don’t know what happened in @realdonaldtrump’s meeting with Putin. We don’t know why he’d conceal that information. We don’t know why he lashes out against anyone who asks what was said to Putin.   We do know that we need the truth. And that we will find it.
South Florida folks, I’m joining @WPLGLocal10 today. Check it out!
This is not normal. There is no legitimate national security rationale for keeping American officials in the dark. Trump must be accountable for his relationship with Putin. https://t.co/n23zjOpC2a
WaPo: “U.S. officials said there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Trump’s face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years.”
This is staggering. The nonpartisan civil servants of the FBI, who pledge to protect our nation, were so alarmed that @POTUS may be compromised by the Russians that felt it was their duty to investigate.  This isn’t about politics; it’s keeping the WH safe from Russian influence.
Career FBI professionals committed to the rule of law &amp; pursuit of justice were concerned about Russian connections to Pres. Trump &amp; potential coverup.   Their concern has been validated by the indictments &amp; convictions of Trump advisors.   #ProtectMueller https://t.co/YCmMNW37aH

Donald Trump, December 11, 2018:   “I am proud to shut down the government for border security... I will take the mantle... I will be the one to shut it down.”  President Trump, you have now caused the longest shutdown in our history. And the country suffers for it.
Trump finally enters the history books. Not for the “biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.” (FALSE)  Not for accomplishing “more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” (FALSE)  But for causing the longest government shutdown ever. (SADLY TRUE) https://t.co/BT8DTTDMll
And here’s the proof of the lie.   When Trump said he would get Mexico to fund the wall he didn’t mean he’d make a trade deal (which DOESN’T pay for it) his campaign had a plan to extract a one-time payment.  He can’t keep that promise.  Taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for it. https://t.co/XGHfDFxKOP
President Trump is inventing a crisis &amp; erasing his history of campaign promises.  No matter how he meant, “Mexico will pay for it,” asking American taxpayers for over $5 billion isn’t it. https://t.co/aih0ekANPy
For 2 years, this Admin. has failed to appoint a Special Envoy to combat anti-Semitism abroad.  The House just passed a bipartisan bill to elevate the position &amp; push the Admin. to finally fill the vacancy.  The WH must lead the charge against anti-Semitism globally &amp; at home. https://t.co/LK2oGK8PhA

It has been 100 days since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered. We cannot allow this brutal murder to be forgotten. We must stand up for human rights, for freedom of the press and for American values.

I appreciate @SGottliebFDA providing this info to the American people.   But, shifting resources to maintain high risk inspections means that this shutdown is damaging FDA’s work to keep folks safe in other areas.

You did it! Pointing out that Democrats have long stood for strong border security including physical barriers, but are unwilling to waste taxpayer resources on an ineffective wall to stroke the president’s ego, will certainly end this damaging shutdown.   Good work! https://t.co/D1bAWVxWfO
RC: “Every member of Congress representing one of the nine districts along the border opposes constructing a wall.”  Including R-Rep. Will Hurd.  Don’t you think members at the border would be hearing from their constituents about this “crisis” if there was one as Trump claims?
Millions of Americans have a pre-existing condition. If the @HouseGOP succeeds in dismantling the ACA, they could lose out on protections against discrimination – which would send their costs soaring. RT to spread the word. #ProtectOurCare
This is outrageous. This law has been in effect less than a year but has already helped law enforcement keep communities safe.   And yet this state Rep. would rather satisfy the gun lobby’s demands than work for Floridians’ safety.  https://t.co/eVHXJuzeme
As President Trump throws his temper tantrum at the White House, @HouseDemocrats and some Republicans just voted to fund the IRS so hardworking families can receive their tax refunds on time.   The Senate should do their job and pass this funding bill.

If you buy a gun you should have to pass a background check. Every time.   Most gun owners have already completed background checks.   Why is the NRA arguing that we should make it as easy as possible for dangerous people to avoid them? https://t.co/ggiaPV3bj6
Trump wants to frame the shutdown as Democrats obstructing his wall, but that’s not the case. Trump is failing to look out for Americans, favoring his own political needs over the needs of the people. Don’t be confused, this is a #TrumpShutdown.
Trump’s address to the nation is textbook fear mongering. Filled with mischaracterizations of what’s actually happening at the border, Trump’s remarks show the unpaid workers aren’t on his mind. Trump is placing politics over people. #TrumpShutdown
Democrats support border security &amp; strong national defenses. Democrats prioritize national security.   We do not support an expensive and ineffective wall. We don’t support the #TrumpShutdown and call on Republicans to put country above politics.
A wall won’t solve a humanitarian crisis.   Are you committing to ending Trump’s family separation policy?  Are you ready to end the shutdown with veto-proof majorities?   If not, what is this tweet? https://t.co/LAsuvJrPfs

With the introduction of #HR8 the House begins its work to strengthen our gun laws.   If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.   Let’s end the private sale loophole and finally require universal background checks. https://t.co/IYRH1qxAqz
Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That’s not a pattern – it’s an epidemic.   #HR8 provides one commonsense, bipartisan way to address it - universal background checks.   Today is the start of something big.

When the President rejects climate science and tears down the progress made to halt further damage to the environment, we are in trouble. Climate reports from sources inside and out of the government warn that we need to reduce carbon emissions, yet they are on the rise.

The #TrumpShutdown is having a real effect on Americans. Soon, Federal workers will go without pay, by the end of the month 40 million SNAP beneficiaries will be without aid, and the WIC food assistance program has already been cut off. @RealDonaldTrump, end this shutdown.

A new Congress and...@MickeyHart of the Dead!  Thrilled to thank Mickey &amp; @deadandcompany for the love they showed during their show after the MSD tragedy. We both believe communities should be free from gun violence.   “Ain’t no time to hate, barely time to wait.” https://t.co/AzMLF9jpDI
Thank you @SpeakerPelosi for recommitting the House to finally passing common sense gun safety legislation to make our communities safer. #MSDStrong

.@POTUS lacks such a basic understanding of strategic foreign policy, it’s astounding. Iran doing “what they want” in Syria is a threat to US interests in the entire region. https://t.co/hpU2D8InZj
As we begin 2019, I look back on 2018 and reflect on the tragedy that impacted so many of us in my @SoFlaOpinion piece. #SF100 https://t.co/De8RrIwLaw
American students shouldn’t have to live in fear. The NRA shouldn’t have a veto on stronger gun safety laws.   In 2018, we stood up.  In 2019, we will grow stronger.   #keepkidssafe #msdstrong  https://t.co/7QsnuuA9rJ
The President owes Congress and the American people an explanation on how withdrawing from the fight against ISIS now will make the US &amp; allies safer. This decision goes against the advice of natl security &amp; military experts &amp; abandons our allies. https://t.co/a1hzF4kCcf
VA says it Will stop arbitrarily cutting off payments to caregivers of disabled veterans. That’s good news.   The bad news is that VA cannot explain why this was happening in the first place. Shameful. https://t.co/MvddBy9OBZ
The system to stop folks from getting guns that shouldn’t have them needs improvement. Research shows that when people lie on forms to get guns they are more likely to commit gun crimes. This demands action. In the new Congress this will be a top priority. https://t.co/mqmdNng7CK
It is incredibly sad that if a kid in America today refuses to accept gun violence in their schools as normal, then they must face targeted threats against them and their family at home.   Continue to be so proud of these students and amazed at their bravery. https://t.co/3afvjs3vT9
President Trump intentionally mischaracterized Sec Mattis resignation as “retiring w/ distinction.”  It’s clear Mattis quit bc of Trump’s dangerous decision on Syria.  Americans should be able to expect the president to tell the truth. Again &amp; again this president lets them down. https://t.co/xeZavB2NsW
Trump griped about Sessions’ recusal &amp; plucked an inexperienced, unqualified partisan who antagonized Mueller as Acting AG outside DOJ succession.   He wanted loyalty over rule of law.  Looks like he got it. https://t.co/1eJ0AcBSJq

Friday deadline is a PARTIAL shutdown. Only some agencies impacted. Would force essential employees at FEMA, Coast Guard, TSA &amp; Border Patrol to work unpaid.   Trump likes to talk tough about law/order &amp; secure borders but now he’s proud to shut down agencies that do that work?

Six years on, let's all reflect on the lives lost at Sandy Hook Elementary. https://t.co/UTGXzjePfU
For all the families and victims I push myself to end these shootings and to keep our communities safe. It’s our duty to ensure future anniversaries are met with change.
Six years ago, tragedy struck the nation when 20 six and seven year-old students and six educators were shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary school. I think about and pray for those lost every day.
Multiple terror attacks in Israel over the past week. The world must condemn this terrorism and it must end.
It does not seem right for a panel dominated by law enforcement to pass the job of armed security off on teachers—people who are dedicated to educating and nurturing their students not deciding when the time is right to use lethal force.
There is no evidence that arming teachers will make our students safer. There are many stories of students being accidentally hurt when teachers have guns in their classrooms.   Reminder. MSD commission took no testimony on arming teachers but recommended it anyway.
Conspiracy against US?  Butina: “Do you want to continue the policy of sanctions?” Trump: "I know Putin and I'll tell you what, we get along with Putin.”  #ProtectMueller https://t.co/yvpMRQo4tr

@GDTRFB IF you get rich on destroying the planet... then that’s by design.   If you are an American taxpayer this bill takes the fees collected from polluters and gives it back to YOU, not the government. The dividend is an estimated $350/month for a family of 4.

The Trump Administration tried to use Black Friday to bury its own report that shows the danger of this Admin’s reckless climate policies.  We can’t let these dire warnings about climate change get lost in the holiday shuffle. https://t.co/AjG5hbyCP3
As we give thanks this weekend, I continue to think of Bob Levinson, and the entire Levinson family who are celebrating yet another holiday without their husband, father, and grandfather. It is time to bring Bob home. #helpboblevinson
Shortly I’ll be joining @Acosta @CNN @CNNSitRoom to talk about developments in the Mueller investigation &amp; House Republicans issuing subpoenas for closed-door private hearings w/ fmr FBI Director Comey &amp; fmr AG Lynch.
I sat with Raed a couple of months ago as he shared with me the multiple kidnappings and assassination attempts he’d survived. But he refused to be silenced. For Raed and for those suffering in Syria, we must continue to stand for freedom &amp; democracy. https://t.co/FAgXqcBXGo
To add to the near-unanimous chorus warning about climate change, here’s a Trump Admin. report warning that the continental US is already 1.8 F warmer than 100 years ago and could see another 2.3 F warmer by 2050. No more excuses-we need climate action.  https://t.co/kMGcI5beaG

The House Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa will be under new leadership in January. Prepare for a full exploration of these issues.
Why is it so hard for @POTUS to say he believes the US intel community?    Why does he always hedge?    “Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t?”   Why is he more trusting of the statements from foreign governments than our intel professionals?
Deeply disturbed by unwillingness of POTUS to even consider options that would allow us to: maintain pressure on Iran, protect American jobs, AND stand up for our values.
.@POTUS just stood in front of WH and told every country as long as you buy our arms, we’re happy to turn our backs on human rights.
Gas prices going up? Not giving Saudi arms deals to Russia and China? Doubting the intel community AGAIN?  Not a word about American values. Or human rights. Or outrage over murdered &amp; dismembered journalist.   Appalling lack of American leadership by the President.  Who are we?
This statement makes it clear the President has decided how he will proceed without waiting to hear all the facts in the Khashoggi case. Simply calling his murder horrible, issuing some sanctions and reminding us the world is dangerous won’t put the issue to rest.
Mr. President, there’s no doubt the Saudis are an important partner in our efforts to thwart Iranian aggression. We remain committed to that goal. But we can still be consistent w/ our values &amp; hold our partners &amp; allies accountable. https://t.co/eHFbeprM8d
Thank you to the MSD families, law enforcement, and other members of the MSD Safety Commission for their hard work on these draft recommendations.   We must continue to work together to make our schools safer from gun violence.  https://t.co/n0Iw6ukdgC

Sasquatch is real, but Mueller is a hoax.   Voter suppression doesn’t happen so we don’t need the Voting Rights Act, but counting votes is “stealing the election.”  Climate change isn’t real.   Shouldn’t standing up against this nonsense be bipartisan? https://t.co/sMzmcDcdD9

Freedom of the press is sacred. When a judge rules in favor of @CNN to restore Jim Acosta’s WH press credential, it tells the President he cannot arbitrarily silence journalists. This is a win for press freedom.
The push to make Stop the Bleed training a part of every student’s education is a disturbing reminder of Congress’ failure to act to prevent mass shootings.   I have participated in this training.

Important reporting from @germanrlopez.  Strong gun laws work. They work better if they can’t be circumvented by weak gun laws in other states.

This is an important victory. There are many common-sense reforms that are slowly happening around the country, but it’s time for Congress to work toward nation-wide reforms that close loopholes and make our communities safer from gun violence. https://t.co/hmj8JqKYiv
Honest question. Does @marcorubio still believe Democrats are trying to “steal the election?” If yes, where is the evidence. If no, why not admit that he went too far? He’s had nearly a week and over 60 tweets to clarify. https://t.co/AyMTyGaZtX
Hamas responds to targeted Israeli anti-terror operation by indiscriminately firing 300 rockets at Israeli towns and cities. Hamas is a terrorist organization that once again shows utter disregard for the lives of innocent Israelis - and Palestinians.
The California wild fires have placed more than 13 million people in danger and tragically claimed the lives of dozens.   My prayers are going to the brave firefighters doing all they can to keep everyone safe and to every Californian forced to evacuate.
Another day, another baseless conspiracy theory tweet by President Trump. His loyal allies @FLGovScott and @marcorubio are following his marching orders closely.  Why are they so afraid of an honest, legally-mandated vote recount?   #CountEveryVote https://t.co/8J5L53X8LE
Irony and a tough loss I can handle.   We shall see.   What I can’t stand is our US Senator @marcorubio throwing around baseless allegations of fraud.   FDLE: no fraud.  Election monitors: no fraud.  Secretary of State: no fraud. https://t.co/cQMPm901ye

In 2012, I fought for my 91-year-old constituent, a Bronze Star veteran from the Battle of the Bulge, to get back on the voter rolls after he was illegally purged by Governor Scott.  His vote was counted.  Every vote must be counted.  #CountEveryVote   https://t.co/sgPqerNUjD
We must #CountEveryVote. Stop lying about a legally mandated recount and show me evidence of any voter fraud. Neither you nor Rubio has any evidence - just dangerous rhetoric.  The person with the most votes wins. This isn’t complicated for those on the side of the people. https://t.co/D4JOku7TM4

The governor, who is in charge of our elections and on the ballot, and our sitting junior senator, shouldn’t get in the way.   #CountEveryVote
.@marcorubio and Governor Scott are attacking the Broward SOE to undermine the integrity of this election before the votes are even counted.  The truth is, the canvassing board is working diligently to count ever vote in Broward before the results are due on Saturday.
As an elected representative of every Floridian, @marcorubio should be working hard to ensure his constituents’ votes are counted. Instead he’s making accusations with zero evidence to cloud the legitimacy of the election process.   #CountEveryVote
The current governor/senate candidate and junior senator from Florida are making reckless and dangerous accusations about this election in a blatant attempt to avoid counting every vote.   We can’t let that happen.   Every vote must be counted.  #CountEveryVote
This is an act of desperation.   No politician should be afraid of the result when every vote is counted.   Florida voters should be afraid when law enforcement is deployed to prevent votes from being counted. https://t.co/5KKlA7bSq2
Stopping the vote count before every vote is counted is fraud against the voters and the Constitution. The only scandal would be shutting down an honest count. One person, one vote. And every vote must count. https://t.co/lKBpPZzbZv
We must count every single vote in Florida. From the WW2 vet to the single mom. One person, one vote. Americans have fought and died for the right to vote and have their vote counted. Rick Scott cannot take that away from any Floridian. https://t.co/RJfA6TLE5D
Sen. Rubio should not wildly speculate &amp; make reckless charges questioning the legitimacy of elections. Instead let’s count every single vote, shall we?  Marco, it doesn’t even take six words, let alone six tweets to say, “EVERY. VOTE. SHOULD. BE. COUNTED.” https://t.co/nGC3d3iWT0
IMPORTANT THREAD:  @drmlb walks the NRA through some of the science that shows the risks guns pose to public health.   NRA wants this to be political. I want this to be practical. Congress should be following the science to make us all safer from gun violence. https://t.co/FEGBJatNkS

Their motto? “People saving people.”  I’m introducing legislation to create the National Gun Safety Administration. Only difference? Substitute “”vehicle-related crashes” with “gun-related violence.”   It’s time for people to save people - from gun violence.
There are always people who complain that we don’t blame cars for traffic deaths. And they say it’s people not guns.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a federal agency whose mission is, “Save lives, prevent injuries, reduce vehicle-related crashes."
“It’s a horrific scene.” “Our thoughts &amp; prayers go out to the families.” “This has to stop.”  Louisville, Thu, 10/25 Squirrel Hill, Sat 10/27 Tallahassee, Fri 11/2 Thousand Oaks, Wed 11/7  Just the past 2 weeks. We have a gun violence crisis in America. Guns. It’s about guns.
Failure to take action on gun violence puts our law enforcement officers in the line of fire every day. Thinking of Sgt Helus and praying for his family this morning.
A Democratic House will take up comprehensive, nation-wide reforms, but we can’t make our communities safer if we don’t do this together. We need both parties to recognize that this shouldn’t be normal.

I’m a Jew. I grew up in Pennsylvania. My conservative synagogue was the center of my life. This mass shooting, like the one a few miles from my home, feels intensely personal. Again.  We’re divided on so much, but can we come together to condemn hatred and violence? Just that?
This synagogue, this Jewish community, and this neighborhood will never be the same. Sending love from South Florida. We are with you - today, tomorrow and every day as we work to make this madness stop.
This morning, I spoke to high school activists about taking action to stop mass shootings. Then I walked out to learn of a mass shooting at a synagogue. My heart breaks for the families.  It breaks for the community.  My heart breaks for America. This is soul crushing.
A suspect was arrested in South Florida in connection with the string of mail bombs.  Deep gratitude to the law enforcement officers who worked around the clock to keep us safe.   If this suspect sent the bombs, he may be our neighbor, but he does not represent our community.
Law enforcement officers will investigate this string of bomb deliveries &amp; perpetrators will be brought to justice.  I’m glad everyone is safe, incl. my friend @RepDWStweets and her staff.  Americans must stand together against these awful acts of terror.

The Trump Admin is weakening the comprehensive benefits in Obamacare &amp; replacing them with Trump Care Junk Plans.  Many Americans still pay too much for their health care, those hard earned dollars should be buying REAL benefits not headaches &amp; denials from insurance companies.

Given the repeated denials, hard to take the Saudi explanation of a fistfight gone wrong seriously. US-Saudi relationship is too important to allow this to continue to go unresolved. US must get full accounting of facts &amp; take appropriate action to stand up for our values.
2 weeks after Khashoggi entered the consulate, Saudis now acknowledge his death &amp; fired 5 “officials” &amp; arrested others. But we still don’t know who was part of the plot. This can’t just get swept under the rug. US intel must verify facts. We must stand up for human rights.

Medicaid expansion is making it easier for people with opioid and other substance abuse disorders to get the care they need. We need to continue to make it easier for them and we have the ability to do so. Let’s make it happen. #ExpandMedicaid
Why should Florida #expandmedicaid? Because children deserve access to consistent medical care. Children in low income families are 45% likelier to have a well-visit when their parent is enrolled in Medicaid.
Families and communities in Medicaid expansion states are already realizing the benefits – better health outcomes, better access to care, more financial security, and more support for employment. Florida should #expandmedicaid because Floridians deserves these outcomes, too.
Necessary care should not be contingent upon what is in your bank account. Florida should #expandmedicaid because Medicaid enrollees are less likely to forgo care due to costs. https://t.co/0R7ANFc4JF
Florida should #ExpandMedicaid.   In Medicaid expansion states across the country, more people are reporting excellent health and regular care for chronic conditions and fewer people are reporting poor health and trouble paying medical bills.

King tide, the highest tide mark of the year, even affects inland parts of South Florida. Today I spoke with Fort Lauderdale businesses about their experiences dealing with the challenges of flooding. Rising sea level, caused by climate change, will only make these tides worse. https://t.co/LXdt58mjhc
Rising tides are forcing coastal cities to adapt. Four of the nation’s most vulnerable cities to flooding by 2050 are in my district, so this issue is personal for me.

I urge the State Dept to immediately raise with the Saudis the truly shocking reports that journalist &amp; US resident Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.   https://t.co/mGM2dhHlEw
Catch me on @MSNBC with @AlexWitt at 12:15pm, where I’ll share my thoughts on Kavanaugh’s confirmation and what this means for our country’s future.

Temporary Protected Status protects 72,000 people in Florida.   A judge blocked the Trump Admin from ending TPS.   These are people who fled dangerous conditions. We must demand that President Trump start living up to our values. https://t.co/OWgwdabI2k
Our failure to take action to prevent gun violence makes all Americans less safe.   That includes people who are armed and trained like the brave officers who were ambushed in Florence County.   I am praying for them and their families. https://t.co/IpPgsbQu8c
The DOJ charged Russian intelligence operatives with hack of doping agency and other organizations. Russia is doing more than targeting elections. They are using their resources to undermine the activities of organizations across the globe. We must do more to counter this threat.
We fought to get the STOP School Violence Act passed because action was demanded &amp; we knew that change was necessary.   Recently, the Broward County school board was awarded two School Violence grants that will help make our schools safer &amp; help students get the support needed.
.@PressSec just claimed that Trump didn’t mock Dr. Ford, only stated facts.  This, of course, is not the case. True to form, Trump lashed out &amp; insulted someone he knows little about.  @realdonaldtrump, stop mocking and demeaning women. And take Dr. Ford’s allegations seriously.
The earthquake &amp; tsunami in Indonesia have led to over 1,300 deaths &amp; massive damage. I’m sending my condolences to the survivors &amp; victims’ families. Trump said he is sending first responders &amp; military teams to assist with the recovery. We can’t let those in need of aid down.

A lot to unpack.   Kavanaugh’s team &amp; Republicans trying to cut off investigators from information.

.@realDonaldTrump never ceases to amaze.   Today he claimed “it’s a scary time” for young men in this country. He does this as he wraps up a month of minimizing the importance of sexual assault and questions the intentions of survivors. https://t.co/jjByJ4xEyi

Judge Kavanaugh lied.   Senator Harris: Did you watch Dr. Ford’s testimony?  Kavanaugh: I did not.   He gave Senators reasons to question his truthfulness &amp; temperament and reason to reject his nomination. https://t.co/pDjswyi8Vw
Off to a good start. I-N-T-E-R-R-O-G-A-T-E-D! https://t.co/LeC0FzCh3r
This hearing is about finding the truth. If @LindseyGrahamSC doesn’t think it’s worth time to hear a victim tell her story or have Kavanaugh answer her allegations then he shouldn’t be determining who is on the Supreme Court.
#IBelieveSurvivors   As this hearing gets underway, let’s remember that shaming women who come forward to share their painful stories, and immediately questioning their intentions, only discredits those who refuse to take survivors seriously.   Respect. Respect. Respect.
Dr. Ford’s bravery is inspiring.  The fact that United States Senators are getting ready to attack her is astounding.
Addressing climate change will require action by all levels of government, from cities and counties to the federal government. @CityBocaRaton passed a strong resolution on the growing threat of climate change and the need for Congress to do more.   Thank you for taking action. https://t.co/HbFKLh3jTT
Tmw Ford &amp; Kavanaugh testify.  8 months since House &amp; 4 months since Senate passed reforms to address sexual harassment in Congress  STILL nothing sent to President  Those who sexually harass &amp; abuse must be held personally accountable. No more secret taxpayer-funded settlements.
When originally passed, the Violence Against Women Act was a landmark bill that highlighted our effort to protect women in this country against sexual assault &amp; domestic violence. But there is still so much more to do. We must reaffirm our commitment to protecting women. #VAWA
3 Yale Law School classmates who supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation &amp; his law professor who testified on his behalf now support a full investigation.    This is about finding the truth.   It isn’t a “con.”   It isn’t a “smear.”   It’s the Senate’s job. https://t.co/n7M32aRcgM

Whether fired or forced to resign, Rod Rosenstein’s ouster will be @realdonaldtrump’s latest attempt to obstruct justice.   @HouseJudiciary must convene &amp; hold hearing on obstruction of justice THIS WEEK.   The American people demand accountability. The Constitution requires it.

One year after #HurricaneMaria and fellow Americans in #PuertoRico are still living without adequate food, water, and power.   @realdonaldtrump must accept what happened in PR and commit to improving recovery efforts in the future. 3,000 Americans were lost. We must do better.

Why does the NRA want to allow people to print guns at home?  Fear.   Gun corporations that run the NRA try to use our fear against us.   They use it to stop stronger gun laws &amp; sell more guns.   We have to take action to stop them.  Thanks @fred_guttenberg for your leadership. https://t.co/7kL8pNSMEZ
In 6 months since the attack at MSD we’ve taken important steps to improve school security.  Trump Admin’s decision to greenlight 3D-printed guns online weakens those steps.  3D-printed guns are untraceable, undetectable &amp; should be unacceptable to every American.  #Stop3Dguns https://t.co/flKPzCR6we
It is extremely dangerous for the President to attack and degrade reporters for doing their honest job. They help shed light on cover ups and expose malfeasance by public officials. Corruption, not a free press, is the true #EnemyOfTheState.  @HeraldOpEd  https://t.co/s0cnitqZW7

This program is too important to too many Americans. As Republicans try to cut benefits, Democrats are working to strengthen the program.   My bill, the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act, would extend its solvency for many generations to come. #SocSec83
Social Security has been working for 83 years. 1 in 5 retirees rely solely on Social Security for income.   But this program isn’t just for seniors; 6.4 million children and 10.4 million disabled workers and their dependents benefit from Social Security. #SocSec83
The ability to retire with dignity and financial security after a lifetime of hard work is a cornerstone of the American dream.   #OnThisDay in 1935, the Social Security program was signed into law, guaranteeing Americans they won’t be left penniless when they retire. #SocSec83

Rosenstein will not be impeached.   My Republican colleagues want to get rid of Rosenstein because they want to stop the Mueller investigation, but we won’t let that happen.   We will #ProtectRosenstein because justice trumps politics.
Cash or check isn’t the problem. The fact that @realdonaldtrump and his campaign lied to the American people and tried to cover up this payment is a huge problem.   This President has shown us he doesn’t care about the truth.
Russia attacked our democracy and will do it again. Trump believes Vladimir Putin and attacks our intel agencies, FBI and DOJ.   And everything you do prevents us from getting the truth. But we will.   #ProtectRosenstein #ProtectMueller https://t.co/lauMHhRsnG
Bolton says Putin won’t visit DC until Russia [investigation] is over.   I’m going to guess that once we know the whole truth of Russia’s attack on our elections he won’t be visiting.  Putin is not welcome to visit the US.   Trump is welcome to start standing up for our country.
As schools around the country bolster their security, these blueprints would allow anyone to make a plastic gun that won’t set off metal detectors at security check points. We can’t let that happen.

Farmers are hurting. Our Pres. recklessly started a trade war that farmers are paying for. Now emergency funds are being prepared to cover for the losses Trump’s trade war caused.   Being POTUS isn’t a reality show, @realdonaldtrump. Your actions can hurt people. And they have.
Israeli Air Force took down a Syrian regime jet that entered 2kms into Israel’s airspace. Israel has the right to defend itself against any hostile incursions into its territory. Assad and Iranian forces must not be allowed to threaten Israel.

I am shocked by what we just witnessed.   Trump recited his Twitter feed, refused to support our intel. community, &amp; issued ridiculous partisan attacks.   And excessive praise for Putin.   Trump once said he wanted to testify under oath.  Now is the time. It’s urgent. #PutinTrump
.@realdonaldtrump didn’t hold Putin responsible, &amp; he didn’t say one negative word about Putin &amp; his attack against our country.   Our President likes to talk tough, but when it came time to take a strong stand on behalf of the US, he completely and utterly failed.   #PutinTrump

That Europe has become more diverse, in part, by welcoming refugees &amp; asylum seekers shows the humanity of its people &amp; should be celebrated.  Lamenting “the loss of culture” is a racist dog whistle.

Your excuse is not good enough.   Maybe the Trump Admin should have worked with Congress to fix a fundamentally broken immigration system before using it to perpetuate human rights abuses against children.  #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/Yuy5V9Qlle
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has resigned.   This is not a virtuous moment for the Trump Administration. The time to #FirePruitt was long, long ago.
This is a re-enactment based on real court transcripts.   Children who appear alone in court aren’t “representing themselves,” they are being processed by a system that does not value their humanity. https://t.co/tZ6COky31K
Thank you @RepHastingsFL for this thoughtful piece on gun violence. The gun violence epidemic must end so that no more children fear for their safety, whether walking the halls of school or the sidewalk home.  https://t.co/a8eqfaaybX
Dear Sen. McConnell,  Nope!  There’s a lot the federal government can do to help stop school shootings. We just need our Congressional leaders to show some courage and stand up to the gun lobby.   https://t.co/xTpqVFy1ha

Dreamers are our friends, neighbors, coworkers, and future leaders.  They live in fear of what will happen next. President Trump failed them when he moved to end DACA.   Congress must put politics aside and act urgently to protect them.   https://t.co/kn74enxoUB
A woman’s right to choose is not in question by a majority of Americans. It is settled law.   Mr. President, listen to them and don’t nominate a #SCOTUS justice that will throw this right away.   https://t.co/3ndlm0WULV
I have a message for @realdonaldtrump-news cycles will come and go, but the American people demanding you #FirePruitt aren’t going anywhere.  In the latest scandal, Pruitt directed a subordinate to find his wife a job that pays $200,000.  Enough of the corruption and deceit.
Sad to think more WH staff time &amp; thought went into the political calculation for this decision than the effort to force Congressional Republicans to take action against gun violence.   We should lower the flag &amp; not raise it until we do something. https://t.co/k3GlGRRrJW
Yes, we need better security in our newsrooms &amp; schools &amp; churches &amp; clubs &amp; neighborhoods.  Security measures are necessary but aren’t enough to stop the gun violence epidemic.  Know what else we need? Lawmakers with the guts to stand up to the gun lobby. https://t.co/n4hWtxbH38

Reports that first responders arrived in one minute. Thank God for them.  Thanks to all of our first responders for their work every day.
Yes we’re going to talk about gun violence. Now. Because there was just another mass shooting. Now is the time to talk about all the ways we can do something to save lives.
So sorry for the tragic loss of life. Thinking about all lives lost and praying for their families and all the injured.
Reporters travel to dangerous conflict zones to do their important work. The newsroom shouldn’t be one of them. Horrible news.
Just saw news that five have been killed. Others gravely injured
It is now confirmed that there have been multiple casualties and injuries. The shooting took place in the newspapers newsroom.
My Republican colleague told Rosenstein to “finish [Mueller’s] investigation the hell up.”  When will the GOP and @realDonaldTrump understand that justice doesn’t run on their political timeline?

McConnell stole Obama’s @Scotus seat and gave it to Trump. Now our country’s highest court could be tilted in favor of special interests over the American people. Reproductive, LGBT, and voting rights are at serious risk. Our slow progress toward equality could now be undone.
There are 147 fake women’s health centers in FL. 5 men on @SCOTUS used the First Amendment to protect their lies. Anti-Choice activists impersonate doctors &amp; falsely tell women that abortion makes it 400x more likely they’ll get breast cancer. We must #EndTheLies   #NIFLAvBecerra
The GOP wants to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to balance the budget. I don’t recall the GOP being concerned with frugality when they gave their rich friends a 1.5 trillion-dollar tax break. Don’t use seniors to fix your mistake. They deserve better. #GOPTaxScam

“Supreme Court Upholds Trump Travel Ban”  Don’t judge Trump’s Muslim Ban by whether it is Constitutional.   Judge it by whether it is right.   It’s not.   So stand up for religious liberty. And stand up for America.  #NoMuslimBan
We need comprehensive immigration reform that makes our system work. To do this, we need to work across the aisle and lift our shared values above the fears that divide us.

POTUS launches a trade war.   Then, Harley-Davidson says it must move some production out of the US to avoid retaliatory tariffs from the EU.  Now, Trump threatens to tax Harley.   @realdonaldtrump-trade wars don’t help American workers, &amp; bullying allies won’t make us stronger.

Fixing the immigration crisis is not a “waste of time.”   DREAMers can’t wait. Children torn from their families can’t wait.    Restoring America’s reputation in the world can’t wait.  Work with us, Mr. President. It will be time well spent.   Believe me. https://t.co/BPzAZMA4oI

.@realdonaldtrump has shown he doesn’t truly care about finding compromise.   He only cares about appearing “tough.”   The Goodlatte immigration bill reflects that agenda.   No pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, ends diversity visas, and funds Trump’s ridiculous wall.
“Hot-button social controversy” and “political calamity” are not how I would frame a humanitarian disaster and betrayal of our values.   https://t.co/Z4zStE481O
And this is NOT OK.   Make special efforts. Work around the clock. Do everything you can. If you claim you’re ending this horrific policy, then end it.   You took these kids from their parents. You should return them to their parents.   #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/EYpwFyuMjj
No country should endure these attacks. Hamas terror threatens Israel and it makes life worse for the people of Gaza. Hamas is a vile terrorist organization. Period.
After using arson kites to spark 20 brush fires throughout the day, Hamas fired 45 more rockets at Israeli towns. One rocket again landed near a kindergarten.

That’s right, Bill. This immoral policy is unacceptable to most Americans, Laura Bush included. And @realDonaldTrump should end it now. https://t.co/S77tl9Q5yd
Locking children up in detention centers is un-American.    @realdonaldtrump you claim you aren’t a politician, yet you play politics with lives of young children and their parents. This is inhumane and the American people are DEMANDING you END THIS.  #FamiliesBelongTogether
He makes the best deals. And he uses trauma inflicted on young children to make them.   Beyond infuriating.
WaPo: President Trump has calculated that he will gain political leverage in congressional negotiations by continuing to enforce a policy he claims to hate — separating immigrant parents from their young children at the southern border, according to White House officials.
Each day this continues is a day you decide to continue it, @SpeakerRyan  That we haven’t voted to stop Trump from separating children &amp; making them feel like animals in cages is disgusting.   This is an emergency for those kids &amp; crisis for our values. Let’s vote to stop it. NOW https://t.co/kBvMyDLcTZ

This week, a man killed four children and severely wounded an Orlando police officer after a 21-hour standoff.   No one with a history of domestic violence should be able to buy or possess a gun. https://t.co/OmYM8ZQqMe
235 Republicans in the House.   51 Republicans in Senate.   Let’s be clear about something-our current immigration crisis isn’t about Democrats.   The kids in detention centers and families torn apart is about...  1 @realdonaldtrump in the White House.
A nation that is committed to moral integrity doesn’t place children—alone—in detainment centers that are described as jails.  A nation that is committed to family values doesn’t go out of its way to rip children from the arms of their parents.  @realdonaldtrump this must end.
If you think you don’t have to say that it was shameful and disgusting for @SteveKingIA to retweet a Nazi sympathizer, you would be wrong.   We should all be saying it.   Especially Republicans.   Especially @SpeakerRyan.   This behavior cannot be normalized.
Irayan Pluth, 11 years old.   Lillia Pluth, 10 years old.   Aidan Lindsey, 6 years old.   Dove Lindsey, 1 year old.   It’s not too soon to talk about strengthening our gun laws. It’s too late.   https://t.co/BmDXPher43
The man who did this was on probation for arson and had a history of domestic violence.   Florida  should require background checks on every purchase.   We don’t.   Florida should block domestic abusers from getting guns.   We don’t.   https://t.co/xNtdZD5ffC

WATCH: Putnam struggles to explain after cabinet meeting. “We would never—and do not do anything other than be completely upfront &amp; transparent &amp; open about any of these issues—good &amp; bad.”  There’s no good news here &amp; hiding report for a year isn’t upfront, transparent, or open. https://t.co/RoVYykEyet
Mr. President, the press isn’t an enemy of this country - it is an essential feature. The power of our institutions and the strength of our values are upheld by a free press.   Attacking the press is an attack on the foundation of America. https://t.co/niar5hmyU4
Pruitt seems to be on a mission to see how much he can get away with and still keep his job.   Today’s corruption news is how he used big-money donors to get his wife a job.   @realDonaldTrump, I’m calling on you AGAIN to #DrainTheSwamp and #FirePruitt.
Just checked, Ag Commissioner Putnam’s massive background check failure still not on Gov. Scott’s cabinet meeting agenda for 9am today.   Gov Scott expects “everybody to be held accountable.” But he doesn’t plan to bring it up? Or ask why Putnam didn’t share IG report with him? https://t.co/DBlI0vRdU2
The UK did the right thing.   There is only one Hezbollah &amp; it’s a terrorist organization responsible for murder of civilians around the world.   Now it’s time for the EU to eliminate the false distinction &amp; designate Hezbollah as a singular terror group. https://t.co/K2DTp3tQEg
The people of Florida had to wait 368 days to learn that Ag. Com. Adam Putnam failed to run background checks for over 1 year.   They shouldn’t have to wait another day for Governor Scott to hold him accountable.   I’m asking that the governor add it to tomorrow’s cabinet agenda. https://t.co/Hcf7uqrTQP
Two years ago, 49 people in a nightclub in Orland lost their lives. The stories of loss from their families are heart-wrenching. The community was devastated that night &amp; the memory of the victims remains strong in our hearts.   We must honor their memory by ending gun violence. https://t.co/9RbaAEqypS
Kim is a brutal dictator. The President views him as a “talented man.” What happened to our values?
Before the President goes too far with his “trust” of this “talented man” who “loves his country very much,” let’s remember that this is a grotesque violator of the human rights of his own people. And he wrongfully imprisons Americans. Let’s not forget that.
POTUS agreed to stop military exercises with South Korea, calling them provocative “war games” – the favored language of North Korea. South Korea apparently surprised. After alienating allies at the G7, US should be reaffirming commitment to security of our allies in region.
Diplomacy is clearly a better path than military action. Pursuit of denuclearization requires detailed technical verification and close consultation with our allies. On that the President was silent.
Disturbing when POTUS sounds more like the guy who attacked our democracy than our closest allies.   Trump’s deal breaking is pushing away our allies &amp; asking Russia back to the table is setting up G6+2 w/ America on the wrong side of the equation. https://t.co/zESpJRqdli

Many people often discuss climate change as a future issue, but in Florida, climate change is having an effect right now. Our beaches are shrinking and every year the problem gets worse. We need to commit ourselves to fighting climate change NOW, not 10 or 15 years in the future.

We need answers. We need to know what Governor Scott and Commissioner Putnam knew and when they knew it. If there is any evidence that they attempted to shield this report from the people of Florida it would be the highest order of corruption. https://t.co/4BgEdCCMGK
@FLGovScott: “Our office was not provided this report.”  Governor meets with his cabinet at least once a month. Ag Commissioner learned about this a year ago.   He didn’t think to mention this terrible screw-up to the Governor? That lives may have been at risk in our state? https://t.co/Agb5pfOysX
Aren’t NICS background checks completed for every concealed weapons permit app to check for disqualifying offenses?  If there were 200,000 applications, why follow up on only 365 and disqualify 291?  If there is an explanation, Putnam owes it to us.   He owed it to us a year ago. https://t.co/4BgEdCCMGK
Putnam now says he launched an investigation and put in safeguards to ensure this doesn’t happen again.   He should release all information related to that investigation and all measures put in place as a result.   @scontorno @MarcACaputo @gbennettpost @browardpolitics https://t.co/QnO1fkzPx3
The Inspector General’s report is dated June 5, 2017.  It concluded that “the allegation of negligence is sustained.”    And they worried they might be embarrassed. What did the Ag Commissioner do in response?  Congress should investigate.  https://t.co/SQ6isAMcIh
TB Times: @adamputnam failed to run concealed carry background checks for OVER 1 YEAR.  My blood is boiling. This is an unimaginable failure for anyone who serves the public.   He made FL less safe. He put lives at risk.   He must resign. https://t.co/orzwdZdpFp
A judge has ruled that the EPA must provide evidence used for Pruitt’s claims that humans aren’t the primary drivers of climate change.  A judge needing to order this shows, once again, that Pruitt isn’t qualified to head the EPA. That’s why I have called on @POTUS to #FirePruitt
This administration is “the swamp.”  Coal tycoon Robert Murray essentially dictated executive orders to the @realdonaldtrump admin on policies that benefited his business interests. This President isn’t a champion against lobbyists, he is their biggest ally.   #DrainTheSwamp

Ben Carson, HUD secretary, suggested that this admins plan to raise rent for low-income Americans is an “attempt to give poor people a way out of poverty”.  You aren’t helping anyone, Secretary Carson. You are making it harder for people to provide for their families.
@JeffreyGuterman Committees can investigate and refer for criminal prosecution. Cabinet officials can be impeached and removed.   These would require Congressional Republicans to stop turning a blind eye to blatant abuse of power.
Bloomberg: Trump toying with inviting Kim Jong Un to Mar-a-Lago.   I hope the North Korea summit leads to denuclearization and peace. But regardless of the outcome, the good people of Palm Beach County are not going to welcome a murderous dictator for a vacation at Mar-a-Lago.
RE Pruitt: Slashing EPA regulations to help out your corporate cronies is corrupt.  Using taxpayer dollars for an expensive phone booth for secret calls is corrupt.

I #WearOrange for Alyssa, Scott, Martin, Nicholas, Aaron, Jaime, Chris, Luke, Cara, Gina, Joaquin, Alaina, Meadow, Helena, Alex, Carmen, and Peter.   And I fight every day to make #NeverAgain a reality.   #MSDStrong https://t.co/401CHJn46J

Gun reform isn’t just backed by common sense, it’s backed by DATA.   Red flag laws, like the Jake Laird Act I introduced with @SusanWBrooks, @RepFredUpton and @RepDebDingell can help reduce gun-related suicides.   We need this law.   https://t.co/T1JvV9TfEe
We #WearOrange because we believe in the movement to end gun violence, we believe in the notion that communities and schools deserve to be safe, and we know that we must stand as one to create change. https://t.co/yVHpAOcCmj
Making the world respect the United States and recklessly imposing tariffs on our allies are not the same thing.   @realDonaldTrump we need to strengthen our alliances not disrupt them by starting a trade war under the false banner of national security.    #FridayFeeling
One year ago, today:  1). The United States left the Paris Agreement.   2). The United States removed itself as a leader on the issue of climate change.   Every other nation on Earth embraces the climate accord and when the issue is this important our absence is unacceptable. https://t.co/T6qT8sIYUh
Trump considering a pardon for a corrupt politician from the Democratic Party (“And he’s a Democrat. He’s not my party.”) doesn’t show that he’s unbiased-it shows that he’s cool with corruption.   Trump is abusing his pardon power to benefit those who have abused their own power.
The Administration’s response to Puerto Rico’s hurricane will forever stand as a failure in American history.   We failed to respond, we failed to provide adequate aid, and the staggering loss of life makes clear that we failed to take care of our own.  https://t.co/01V4JwwnWb
Today @realdonaldtrump will meet with Santa Fe families. He owes it to them. He owes it to families in Parkland and around the country to do more than just offer comfort. We know strong gun laws that respect 2A work. Let’s enact them and enforce them.

This moment of silence is all too familiar and painful for me.   Another tragedy and more lives lost.   During this moment of silence, we must prepare our courage, commit to protecting America’s kids, and be ready to turn this moment of silence into a moment of action.
And when you do, you will also honor the memories of Alyssa, Scott, Martin, Nicholas, Aaron, Jaime, Chris, Luke, Gina, Cara, Joaquin, Alaina, Meadow, Helena, Alex, Carmen, and Peter.   And the lives lost daily to senseless gun violence.   #MSDStrong  #SantaFe https://t.co/UqzrxAkabS

Gun violence in America is complex. Each horrifying incident has its own tragic causes.   The real test for American society is: can we move past the gridlock that has paralyzed us and caused so much pain? Can we have a debate that leads to solutions?
10 families who mourn.  10 injured friends and neighbors.  One more American community that will never be the same.  I’m so sorry it’s too late.   I beg my colleagues to act. You would do anything to protect your kids. It’s time you finally do SOMETHING to protect America’s kids. https://t.co/ee7YhuzqZg

Another piece of our heart was torn out of us this morning.  To the grieving families and survivors, please know that all of us South Florida are here for you. Just like the families and communities of Columbine and Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook and Dunblane have been with us.
It’s been three months since the shooting at Stoneman Douglas. If you are watching this, it should move you to tears. More important, if you’re an elected official, it should move you to action to keep kids safe. And if it doesn’t, then just get the hell out of our way.
I’m watching kids on TV. They’re standing outside their high school. And they’re crying because they survived a school shooting. It is so familiar and so horrifying. I’m so sad and so, so angry.
There is an active shooter at a high school in Texas. We are following the story closely. And we are sad, disgusted, and outraged to have to say that—again.

According to @SandyHook Promise, most mass shootings are planned for 6 months to 1 year. Most people who die by suicide tell someone they know about their plan. If police can take action to remove guns from people who are a danger to themselves or others, we can save lives.
After a gunman shot four officers and took the life of Ofc Jake Laird, Indiana passed a bipartisan law to allow police to remove guns from dangerous hands. The rest of the nation needs to do the same. https://t.co/7F4e0SvdrE
.@realdonaldtrump is directing DHS to separate parents and children crossing the border, effectively tearing apart families that are seeking asylum.   Seeking asylum is entirely legal, yet the President seems intent on being as cruel as possible to stop it.
This bill is just the latest example of @RosLehtinen's career-long commitment to Israel's security and to strengthening the US-Israel relationship. It's an honor to support her in this effort.
In light of Hezbollah and its allies' gains in the Lebanese Parliament, escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, weeks of violence at the Gaza border, and the threat of permanent Iranian presence in Syria -- this bill will help ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.
The US-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act codifies the 2016 US-Israel Memorandum of Understanding that provides historic security assistance to our ally. It also expands cooperation on cyber, space, and joint development assistance projects.

Trump wants to cancel $15 billion of hard fought bipartisan compromise investments in vital federal programs. Nearly half ($7B) from CHIP.   CHIP covers 9 million kids. 850,000 use mental/behavioral services.   Is mental health still a priority for the GOP? (It never was)
When the GOP talk about priorities, we won’t forget that the tax cuts given to the top 1% under the #GOPTaxScam are worth more than the entire SNAP for low income families.   And we certainly won’t forget that the GOP plan on gutting SNAP in order to pay for those tax cuts.
The @NRA has selected a new President, Oliver North.   North was at the heart of the Iran-Contra scandal, so it is fitting for him to join the NRA while it is being investigated for Russian dark money contributions.
.@realdonaldtrump tries to explain obstruction of justice as “fighting back” in the same way a shoplifter tries to explain stealing as a “five finger discount.”  And if the Judiciary Cmte. did its job, we’d hold hearings on obstruction.

If a Russian banker with strong ties to the NRA laughs in the face of investigations into Russian money in our elections, it’s because he thinks American rule of law is a joke.  I think we need to prove him wrong—that’s why I’ve asked 2 committees to investigate NRA dark money.
Republican House Intel Committee's final report selectively ignores evidence of interference and #TrumpRussia contacts.   This report is a purely partisan attempt to misdirect the public. It is disgraceful and a disservice to the American people.
Wendy Vitter is a @realdonaltrump judicial nominee.   She can’t decide if she supports desegregated schools.   Read that again and tell me if you think she would be a good federal judge. I’ll wait…
Mick Mulvaney, a top Trump official, revealed what it takes to get into a room with him--$$$.   Money, more than anything else, is what keeps the swamp in Washington alive.   To get public officials to get back to representing the people, we must get money out of our politics.

Just one member derailed the good work of the Foreign Affairs Committee. All to advance an anti-women’s agenda. I hope we have the opportunity to strengthen the State Dept and support diplomats, but not at the expense of the rights of women and girls around the world.

.@realDonaldTrump is one @foxnews segment away from another Saturday Night Massacre.   That's why the Senate cmte's approval of a bill to protect Special Counsel Mueller from being fired is so important.    This is a no brainer - we must #ProtectMueller
EPA spokesman claims that @EPAScottPruitt testifying before Congress is an opportunity to reiterate accomplishments.  I disagree.   Today’s hearings are an opportunity for Pruitt to admit his misconduct, apologize to the American people, and explain why he denies climate change.
Today we remember Sgt. Noel Ramirez &amp; Deputy Taylor Lindsey of the Gilchrest County Sheriff’s Office, killed in the line of duty. My condolences to their loved ones for their awful loss.    This was the 45th moment of silence for victims of gun violence in the past 64 months.
.@EmmanuelMacron: “We have no Planet B!”  “I believe in building a better future for our children, which requires offering them a planet that is still habitable in 25 years.”  We must rejoin the Paris Accords and join the global effort to take action on climate change.
Yes @EmmanuelMacron The United States must lead the world “to promote our universal values, to express strongly that human rights-the rights of minorities-and shared liberties are the true answers to the disorders of the world.”  These are the values to drive our foreign policy.
“If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.”  These are the words of Mick Mulvaney, a Trump appointee currently running TWO federal agencies.  @realDonaldTrump, still planning to #DrainTheSwamp?

To recap: After bipartisan concerns re Dr. Ronny Jackson’s lack of experience, allegations of a demeaning management style, troubling Rx practices &amp; drunkenness during work hours, President Trump responded by questioning the patriotism of Senators?  Our veterans deserve better.
FEDERAL JUDGE: Trump Admin must continue to accept new and renewed DACA applications.   DREAMers aren’t illegal.  Instead of letting Trump continue to fight in court to find a way to bring chaos and fear to 700,000 young people, let’s pass the #DREAMActNow

The @NRA raised $2.4 million in March to support candidates who block common-sense gun laws.   Oh, also, the “All-American” NRA takes Russian money, so I’m asking @WaysandMeansGOP and @GOPoversight to review dark money &amp; foreign contributions the NRA may have used to sway voters. https://t.co/wOx1MsTK25
On Feb. 14th, 17 students &amp; teachers were killed in another senseless act of gun violence.   In March, the @NRA posted its best fundraising month in 15 years.   The NRA is NOT a civil rights organization; it’s a fundraiser for gun manufacturers trying to protect their interests.
A weapon of war should never be in the hands of a civilian. Luckily, James Shaw Jr. was courageous enough to stare down the threat of death and save lives.   He deserves praise for his bravery and the American people deserve safety.  https://t.co/boHCjcJ9Fi

Every day Americans are killed by guns. This time in a Nashville restaurant.   @SpeakerRyan, over 90% of Americans support fixing our background check system.   It’s time to hold the votes. It’s time to take action.   It’s not too soon. It’s too late.   #EndGunViolence https://t.co/55rUop5JKt
Congress must investigate whether the @NRA illegally used foreign donations to fund its political activity. According to reports, the FEC &amp; FBI are already investigating.

Russia continues to defend the tyrant Assad and skirt its responsibility to uphold int’l law. Russia failed to guarantee removal of all chemical weapons from Syria. The U.S., our allies, &amp; the international community need to hold Putin and Assad accountable.
Russia’s shameless statements at yesterday's emergency UNSC meeting reiterate its disregard for truth &amp; human life. Russia’s human rights record speaks for itself. Moscow’s continued defense of Assad’s brutality and war crimes shows Russia’s true colors.

Horrific reports of another chemical attack in Syria, this time on a hospital. Assad is a ruthless dictator with no regard for human life, emboldened by Russia's backing and UNSC veto.  Human rights matter. POTUS, we can’t just leave Syria’s future up to Putin &amp; Assad.

Trump’s inconsistent &amp; disjointed foreign policy statements contradict our trusted generals. General Votel, head of CENTCOM, says the hard part is still ahead &amp; our role will be crucial. We can’t allow Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah to fill our vacuum and risk an ISIS resurgence.
Trump's recent Syrian withdrawal statements come a year after one of the Assad regime’s chemical weapons attacks killed over 80 innocent civilians. Russia continues to block any Sec. Council action against Assad. And now Trump wants to cede the rest of Syria to Russia and Iran?

“I’m a Democrat, I own guns, I don’t want to take anyone’s guns. I want sane gun laws. If you have questions about why we can’t have sane gun laws, #followthemoney” - Charlie Morecraft, Veteran
“What do we do to help people understand that we aren’t trying to take away #2A and the NRA is just another interest group?” - MSD Student
For the people who say "We can't...we can't" -- Yes we can.   We know the assault weapons ban was and can be successful. Congress just needs the courage to stand up to the gun lobby to do what's right  #EndGunViolence #TownHallForOurLives
Thank you, Lori, for your advocacy. We will never forget Alyssa and we will keep fighting to #MakeSchoolsSafe https://t.co/rrXRbLwLOo
.@davidhogg111 "People of color are far more likely to be the victims of gun violence. If there is more law enforcement in school, how are we going to make sure there isn't discrimination against students of color."  #EndGunViolence https://t.co/X03uwgmKKw
The Second Amendment isn't unlimited.   The question is: Where do we draw the line to make our communities safe from gun violence?  #EndGunViolence #TownHallForOurLives https://t.co/dgyUOMg7p0
Resources are still available to get help. Reach out. Call 2-1-1 or call the helpline. You are not alone.  #MSDStrong https://t.co/O1VLq5Xd1Z
Sam Fuentes: "It feels like we are being treated like prisoners for a crime we didn't commit."   More from MSD students commenting on new clear backpacks rule in their own words: https://t.co/ZRiBfrp1iG  Student voices must be heard to truly improve school safety.
Thank you to Max, Andrew, and Ryan for fighting to make our schools safer. Our students' safety should be everyone's priority.
.@fred_guttenberg thank you for your leadership and your courage. I'm committed to you and every Douglas family to pass legislation to #EndGunViolence  "We will get this done!"  - Fred Guttenberg
Background checks before gun purchases and raising the age for gun purchases to 21 are broadly supported by the American people and deserve action by Congress. #TownHallForOurLives #EndGunViolence https://t.co/3tIHhczp36

I’m hosting a town hall in my district to talk about gun violence and the need for Congress to take action. https://t.co/Qxq7NsnCME
Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism Act so victims could seek justice, &amp; we’ve stood firmly on these victims’ side. If we don't hold terrorists accountable, it's hard to see how we can make progress toward peace. Disappointed this is what the Admin wanted https://t.co/Iwm7KwU8b6
So EPA Admin. Pruitt got a sweetheart lease to an energy lobbyist-linked pad that did double duty as a GOP fundraising hotspot. Oh, and the landlord's pipeline project was approved by EPA at the same time. Just another day in the #TrumpSwamp.
Check in here at 6:30PM where I will be live streaming tonight's town hall from the Coral Springs Center for the Arts.  I'll be taking questions from the FL22 Community and talking about what's next in the fight to #EndGunViolence   See you tonight! https://t.co/Aans9vk930
.@realdonaldtrump Congress and its rules have existed as a check on the Executive long before your Presidency and will continue to do so for years to come. The structure of government won’t change just because you don’t get your way. #NuclearOption
This story should make every American nervous. Sinclar Broadcasting required their local affiliates to criticize "fake news" media. Sounds eerily familiar to communications from our President and his team. Freedom of the press is a foundational principle. We must defend it.
The gun lobby tries to silence our voices, and some lawmakers hope national attention drifts away. But our voices won’t fade and our determination won't wane. When we say #NeverAgain, we mean it. Let’s keep up our momentum and leave gun violence in the past. https://t.co/MDMAq7SKjv
DREAMers came here under no fault of their own, and have known no country other than the US. They are students, professionals, servicemembers and members of our communities. Instead of calling DACA "dead" @realdonaldTrump should work with Congress to protect the DREAMers. #DACA
This town hall is about generating new solutions to the problems in this country. The voices and ideas of those most passionate about ending #GunViolence will be heard, and step-by-step we will make our schools and communities safe. https://t.co/qdmtmcSuvG
I want to start this holiday weekend by thanking my community for standing together and supporting one another in this difficult time. I'm deeply thankful for all of you.   To those celebrating Passover, I wish you a Chag Sameach. To those celebrating Easter, have a happy Easter. https://t.co/YoGcBO0IBH
The #NeverAgain movement isn’t going anywhere. Next Tuesday, I’m hosting a town hall to discuss what steps come next. Thank you to @davidhogg111 @MattxRed and other Stoneman Douglas students for keeping up the national momentum on gun violence prevention.  https://t.co/7gMyig1slG https://t.co/WWIbZewomv
Democrats won’t let valid concerns about Sessions’ DOJ to be used to further Trump’s attempt to obstruct Mueller’s investigation. If Sessions is removed, it won’t be about diverging priorities-it will be because he won’t help Trump break the law. #TrumpRussia  via @TIME https://t.co/ibN563B09k
Trump previously hinted he wanted to pardon Flynn and now the @nytimes is reporting that Trump’s lawyers were “floating” the idea of pardoning Flynn and Manafort. Let’s be clear-offering pardons to hinder Mueller’s investigation is obstruction of justice. #ProtectMueller
What are my constituents asking for? •Gun violence research •Modernize ATF •Universal background checks •High-cap magazine ban •Renewed assault weapon ban  Not on their list: repealing #2A  They don't want the Constitution torn up-they want safety.  https://t.co/2YvrX40gJl

Also, a little FYI to @NRA and the Kansas legislature, guns in schools are already putting kids in danger. (2/5)  https://t.co/1o43dF6wJS
Teachers have made it clear they don't want guns in their classrooms. Yet Kansas lawmakers are considering a proposal that would all but force them to carry weapons by placing the liability for school shootings on the school itself. (1/5)
.@thehill: “Partisanship in global warming opinions is growing”   Partisanship has no place in this discussion. Scientists agree &amp; the data is clear: climate change is a problem &amp; we must do something. Pres. Trump must face reality and address the threats of #climatechange.

It's time for the courts to fully recognize that gerrymandering is an outright threat to the democracy. American voters deserve #FairMaps.   This is what you need to know about this morning's Supreme Court case on partisan gerrymandering.   https://t.co/mDXzQhgdgx
Watch this video. Remember their names and their stories. We have a duty to them, their families, and millions of Americans across the country to #EndGunViolence.  If you have had enough of the violence and grieving, help transform #NeverAgain from a movement into a reality. https://t.co/wAQnA07nXN

Thank you to my dear friend @RosLehtinen for bringing understanding and civility to our national discourse today and throughout her career.  🙏  #NeverAgain https://t.co/5yErA8ZqUB
And finally-   3. You expressed support for raising the age to buy a gun to 21.  @TomRooney and I just introduced a bipartisan bill to do that. This one is easy. Please join us.   #NeverAgain #GunReformNow #MarchForOurLives
More honest dialogue-  2. At the Parkland town hall you said you were reconsidering your views of high-capacity magazines. Are you ready to join me in a bipartisan effort to outlaw them?  #CommonGround #MarchForOurLives  #MSDStrong
Both sides finding common ground will require honest dialogue. Let's start.  1. We marched to save lives not to ban guns - except weapons of war which were banned before. Is there ANY weapon that, after MSD, you believe can kill too many people too quickly and should be banned? https://t.co/yH4BclIpkO
I wake up in the morning inspired because I know we have young leaders like these students fighting to enact change. Their leadership, drive, and passion are all that I need for my #MondayMotivaton   This country's future is bright. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/hcLQzvXnad
USA Today: Amid slumping sales, Remington, manufacturer of weapon used at Sandy Hook, is now trying to use bankruptcy protection to stall the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Sandy Hook families and continue profiting off gun violence.   Shameless.   #GunReformNow #NeverAgain
Fox News: 72% of registered voters want 21 to buy a gun.   I introduced bipartisan legislation with @TomRooney to do that.   @SpeakerRyan let's use this 2 week recess period to give the American people what they want and make a plan to bring HR 5398 to the floor. https://t.co/6blVmdaQAO
.@marcorubio the students of this country are worth more than an election, they are worth more than a vote, and they are certainly worth more than a $1.05.   Help act on gun violence. #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
2 weeks ago I met Naomi at a Town Hall w/ @RepDonBeyer.   Today, the world had the same good fortune.   "I am here today to represent the African American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper."  #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/AqphewvASZ
Let’s stop inviting profiteers of gun violence to the gun debate. It’s time for common sense. It’s time to place the people over the NRA. #EnoughIsEnough #GunReformNow https://t.co/rM64eh8k2G
Hey POTUS. I do remember sitting with you in the WH when you promised to ban bump stocks.  Thx. And I remember you also promised to get universal background checks and 21 to buy a gun. Waiting for your tweet about that promise. Oh, and like you said - don’t be afraid of the NRA. https://t.co/MtP0SDgWs1
I asked the young people of @EpiscopalSEFL what teaching or other aspect of their faith motivated them to be part of the change to end gun violence:   "Thou shalt not kill."  #EnoughIsEnough #NeverAgain https://t.co/y61oUtoER7
Trump has outdone himself by selecting Bolton. In one appointment, he simultaneously increased the influence of the NRA in his Admin. &amp; found another way to tie himself to Russia.  Does he still claim he hires the best people?   #TrumpRussia   https://t.co/M7Gx2IMPjL
These 17 names will always live in my heart. The young men and women of #StonemanDouglas were taken from us far too early. Now their memories are the driving force behind a nationwide movement to end gun violence. #NeverAgain  @AliVelshi @MSNBC https://t.co/y43XwiQ80S

NYT: Citigroup won’t work with companies unless they commit to safer gun sales.   Citi is the latest to take a stand and say #NeverAgain.   More companies--and Members of Congress--need to follow their lead. #GunReformNow
Pssst, @realdonaldtrump - Wanna be on the cover of @TIME again?  Option 1: firing Mueller and triggering a constitutional crisis. BAD!  Option 2: honoring these super students by signing comprehensive gun reform to keep them &amp; our country safe. THAT WOULD BE HUGE! https://t.co/XdAJ3ehV23
This is not a drill. The threat to the Mueller investigation is real and we can't wait until the President executes the next Saturday Night Massacre to protect the search for truth.   @HouseJudDems #ProtectMuellerNow https://t.co/cH4Vtv4o0C
After years of hard work, this spending bill includes major funding for a new federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale. This is a big win for our community!   Thanks to the Fort Lauderdale Cong. Delegation, Mayor @JackSeiler @FTLCityNews and others for their efforts.
Thanks to @DICKS CEO Ed Stack. You’re so right -   “The kids in Florida and across the nation have taken a stand and been brave enough to make their voices heard.  The majority of Americans are demanding that members of Congress take a stand and be brave enough to do their jobs.” https://t.co/0Vx4lWYrB2
Lifting ban on gun violence research, strengthening background check database, funding school security (but not arming teachers) &amp; mental health are all part of tonight’s legislation.   Thank you #MSDStrong students &amp; families. You did this.   Keep going! https://t.co/CdHwusjRrC

On Valentine's Day #MSDStrong teacher Stacey Lippel taught her students how to write the perfect love letter.   Joaquin Oliver and Meadow Pollack never got the chance to deliver theirs.   Heartbreaking testimony w/ @edworkforcedems   #NeverAgain https://t.co/JDI5tx8FFC
This morning I asked the FBI why the investigation into the Parkland shooter was cut short, before it was too late.  We deserve answers. The American people deserve immediate action.  #MSDStrong #NeverAgain #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/57S0h7C0Ho
It was my honor to introduce #StonemanDouglas teacher Stacey Lippel, who is in DC sharing her views on school safety during an @edworkforcedems forum.  Congress must consider a comprehensive approach to gun violence and preventing school shootings. https://t.co/2j9HAynTNt
@RepKClark is right. "We are past platitudes." Students' lives are in danger.  @BetsyDeVosED, we must strengthen mental health services and after-school programs - not weaken them - to make sure students have access to the help they need.
Thank you @RepKClark for asking @BetsyDeVosED questions from #StonemanDouglas students about how the Department of Education will keep our children safe from gun violence in their schools!
Same headline. Different state.  Praying for the injured.  And raging against Congressional inaction. 34 days since #MSDStrong and nothing. NOTHING!  Keep standing up - to the gun lobby and to Congressional leaders who JUST DON’T CARE! https://t.co/w93Prv4U5m

I’m glad the House passed our bipartisan STOP School Violence Act. But make no mistake – this cannot be Congress’ response to #MSD.  We need: - universal background checks - assault weapons ban - 21 to buy a gun - gun violence restraining orders Now! #GunReformNow https://t.co/cxEYsiCidS

7,000 pairs of shoes for the 7,000 children victims of gun violence since Sandy Hook.   I hope Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell took a moment to think about the devastating loss this represents &amp; will join me in the fight to make our communities safe from gun violence. https://t.co/141WQE5Zvq
Senator Rubio can’t say one thing and do another. He can’t support raising minimum age for buying rifles while sponsoring a bill to reverse DC’s age limits. Congress should be working toward strengthening our gun laws, not loosening them. https://t.co/Gv8G2rs2cW
“Imagine every worst possibility in your life, and that’s what it felt like.” – Fred Guttenberg  This time MUST be different. We cannot stop until we take action to strengthen our gun laws.   https://t.co/sHzje8bTpU
I’m inspired by the passion of the Stoneman Douglas students and students from across the country. They are demanding change, and won’t stop until we achieve it.  Because of them, I won’t lose hope that we can achieve meaningful action on #GunReformNow. https://t.co/IDqByOYi9t
We know what needs to be done. There’s broad support to expand background checks, ban bump stocks, increase the age to buy a gun, and get weapons of war off our streets.  So let’s pass #GunReformNow. https://t.co/vdUPQDRswp
It’s been 19 years since Columbine; 5 years since Sandy Hook; nearly 1 month since Stoneman Douglas.  We need to see leadership from the President and Congress; instead, they are shamefully retreating back to the NRA.  There’s no time to wait. We need action now. https://t.co/XSg8dcr6Vj
This week, the House will vote on my bill, the STOP School Violence Act.  I'm proud of this bipartisan bill - but this can't be the only step we take. We need comprehensive #GunReformNow  Read my @SoFlaOpinion #SF100 https://t.co/4lami7iMnK

When I sat with Christine during President Trump's State of the Union, I renewed my commitment to push this Administration to prioritize Bob's case.   I urge this Administration to do everything it can, using all available resources and channels, to bring Bob home to his family.
Today, March 9, 2018 marks the 11th year of Bob Levinson's disappearance. For 4,015 days, this family has been without their husband, father, and grandfather in their lives. https://t.co/8Hrm9tbS7A
Waiting periods, gun violence restraining orders, and 21 to buy a gun are what the people want, but the gun lobby, the legislature and the governor must know that this is just the beginning and not the end of the response to #MSDStrong. We’ll be back, and we won’t stop. https://t.co/NCCNQHr9ZC

Defying the NRA must become the new normal.  21 to by a gun, waiting periods and gun violence restraining orders defy the NRA. The marshal program does not. And it will be repealed when we ban assault weapons. Big first step.  https://t.co/rgX4rQFaPu
This Congress cannot and will not just move on from this tragedy.  The nation will not forget Parkland.  Because this time, we join the #MSDStrong students in declaring, #NeverAgain. https://t.co/uJA2mrORVt
🙋‍♂️  The strength of MSD students forced NRA leaders to abandon their playbook of staying quiet after mass gun violence.   Comments like this will only help more patriotic gun owners understand that NRA execs have only one response to our pain &amp; loss: callous corporate greed. https://t.co/YyK7IUmzKd

Republicans in Congress cheer law enforcement until blaming them can serve as a way out of taking action on stronger gun laws.  Fixing law enforcement failures is important, but won’t put a dent in the more than 36,000 annual gun deaths in America.  #GunReformNow #NeverAgain https://t.co/U3jQKSI8V4

I met with the #StonemanDouglasHS @PoliticsMSD Club just weeks before the shooting &amp; was so impressed by their thoughtfulness.  Now, in response to this tragedy, they are using the lessons learned in class to fight for #gunreformnow. I'm proud to stand with them. #NeverAgain https://t.co/VVF9bQGjEC
No, thank you. Following the courageous lead of the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas is the least any of us can do. #msdstrong #neveragain https://t.co/VDiUFdR5H2

The students of Stoneman Douglas have been clear – America must #neveragain allow the profits of gun manufacturers to come before the safety of our students. Now, Congress must listen to them &amp; take action to #EndGunViolence. #SDMStrong https://t.co/C2PWlb0gal
It's been a difficult week in South Florida.  Together as a community, we grieved and mourned. Together, we laid to rest our beloved Eagles.

Just like the First Amendment, the Second Amendment is a limited right. We cannot own bazookas or tanks, so why do Americans need these weapons?   The Second Amendment did not end when we banned assault weapons for ten years. The only thing that happened was we saved lives.
.@MarcoRubio Please support our efforts to ban weapons of war from our streets. Show me examples of when these weapons are used in defense, because I can show you hundreds of times they are used to kill innocent Americans. https://t.co/UWtaFXnoDv
@profrichdett @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz Richard - I've supported legislation to close background check loopholes, to ban bump stocks, and to reinstate the assault weapons ban.  And I'm demanding my Congressional colleagues join me in supporting these changes that could save lives. #NeverAgainQandA
@KellyEWRoskam Kelly - FL has laws to stop stop abusive dating partners from carrying concealed weapons. But some of our neighboring states don't. States should be able to stop dangerous individuals from acquiring guns. Instead, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would do the opposite.
@limixn321 The "STOP School Violence Act", which would improve school safety, has BIPARTISAN support. There is no reason why @SpeakerRyan shouldn't allow us to vote on this bill immediately when we return to Washington next week. More info on bill: https://t.co/WsNQfJBsAc #NeverAgainQandA
@PatrickKorellis @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz @CAPActionGuns Patrick - the last time Congress enacted any significant gun control measures was over 10 years ago in 2007. Since then, there have been AT LEAST 30 mass shootings.  Students nationwide are demanding change from Congress. Let's make this time different. #NeverAgainQandA
@duffygirl8 @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz Christina - in addition to reinstating the now-expired assault weapons ban, we must also raise the purchase age for ALL firearms to 21. If someone is too young to buy tobacco or alcohol, they're too young to buy a weapon of war.
@ChadwickHimsl @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz @CAPActionGuns That's why Congress should reinstate the assault weapons ban. We should raise the age of purchase for ALL firearms to 21. We should improve the background checks system.  Taking a comprehensive approach to this issue will make our schools and communities safer. #NeverAgainQandA
@ChadwickHimsl @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz @CAPActionGuns Chadwick - Improving school safety and access to mental health services must be a part of our conversation to improve school safety. But the weapons used must be a part of that conversation, too. #NeverAgainQandA
This time must be different. We can't allow another 17 students to be killed at school before we take action. No more.  The brave survivors of #MSDstrong are setting an inspirational example for elected officials in Washington and students nationwide. #StudentsDemandAction
I'm proud to support @RepMaloney's "Gun Show Loophole Closing Act" to require a background check on all firearms transactions occurring at gun shows. Learn more --&gt; https://t.co/o1R093lIGE https://t.co/NyWbIU0MHF
Our Q&amp;A is happening now - tweet your questions to me, @Everytown, @MomsDemand, @SandyHook, @GiffordsCourage, and @BradyBuzz using #NeverAgainQandA https://t.co/5fAKXJ9DTG
@SamSchmir @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz @CAPActionGuns Sam - We should raise the age of purchase for ALL firearms to 21. We should reinstate the assault weapons ban. We should improve the background checks system.  Taking a comprehensive approach to this issue will make our communities - including schools like yours - safe.
@SamSchmir @Everytown @MomsDemand @sandyhook @GiffordsCourage @Bradybuzz @CAPActionGuns Sam - Congress must take action so that every student can feel safe at school.   Improving school safety and access to mental health services must be a part of the conversation. But so must the weapons use.
@GeorgieSpears1 The 10 years before the assault weapons ban: 155 gun massacre deaths 1994-2004, during the ban: 89 gun massacre deaths The 10 years after the ban expired: 302 gun massacre deaths  The assault weapons ban worked. It's time for Congress to reinstate it to save lives.
@PaulieSas Paul - Florida requires those with concealed carry licenses to complete safety training and to have no record of domestic abuse or violent crime. Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia don't have these same rules. We don't want concealed carry reciprocity in Florida, either.
@clifw Clif, I'm proud to support "No Fly No Buy" legislation so that individuals on the terror watchlist won't be able to buy firearms.
@jenkdr @jaketapper @SenBillNelson @marcorubio @browardsheriff @DLoesch Jen, the NRA once supported gun background checks, opposed "the general practice of carrying weapons", and opposed guns in schools. But that organization no longer exists. The 2nd amendment isn't at issue here. The issue is that semiautomatic rifles have no place in our society.
@KeepinKidsSafe The students you'll see on the #ParklandTownHall tonight are determined to stop the next shooting. They are saying #NeverAgain.  The rest of our nation, incl. students, can stand up and join the inspiring #MSDstrong survivors in demanding an end to this violence.
HAPPENING NOW: Tweet your gun violence and school safety questions to me, @Everytown, @MomsDemand, @SandyHook, @GiffordsCourage, @BradyBuzz, and @CAPActionGuns using #NeverAgainQandA.  Let's have a conversation about how we can prevent other schools from enduring this pain.
Ahead of tonight's CNN #ParklandTownHall, you're invited to join me, @Everytown, @MomsDemand, @SandyHook, @GiffordsCourage, @BradyBuzz, and @CAPActionGuns at 7:00 for a Q and A on school safety and gun violence.  Tweet us your questions using #NeverAgainQandA.
One week ago, Parkland and our nation faced a terrible tragedy.  Tonight, we'll hear first-hand from student survivors and the parents of victims at a #ParklandTownHall on CNN with @JakeTapper. I'll be there, as will @SenBillNelson, @marcorubio, @BrowardSheriff, and @DLoesch. https://t.co/cathiciORD
This is what change looks like.  Nationwide, students are standing up and saying enough. Elected officials must listen to their powerful voices. #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/VNMwWPsNXR
Students of Stoneman Douglas: you made this happen! And I know you are just getting started. #NeverAgain #MSDStrong #MarchForOurLives #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/oDKsmbB09J
I agree. But it’s also time to listen to these students and respond with action in Congress. #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/FUNke9a6LT
I was honored to meet these students in recent days, and I know they won’t give up. Not in Tallahassee, not in Washington. We’re going to demand lawmakers take action to prevent any other schools from experiencing this tragedy. #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/RQF3ClSlV7
If you have questions about how you can help the Parkland community respond to last week’s tragedy, more information is available here: https://t.co/nw68h16579
We must remember the 17 angels that we lost. And we must join together to demand action to  make our communities safe.   The students will lead us — to the #MarchForOurLives on March 24, to the halls of power, and, ultimately, to the change our nation so desperately needs.
For those who say it is too soon, who always say it is too soon to make change, you must live with the knowledge that it is too late for the grieving parents, too late for the survivors who will live with this forever, and too late for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas community.
I will do everything in my power to make this time different.   The brave students of #StonemanDouglas are setting an inspirational example for grown adults, self-proclaimed civic leaders, in Washington.  We know that we can stop this from happening in other communities.
To the students who will forever live with the memories -  To the parents who will always worry school isn't safe - To my South FL community, who feels this pain -  As you grieve and mourn, you’ve been clear about one thing: You want action.   I hear you. https://t.co/H5NlPumrNM
Incredible solidarity and support from students at West Boca High School standing with those affected at #StonemanDouglas. https://t.co/YLv7AMEOGM
Is that really the big question? Or is the big question why Congress is too cowardly to take action to stop children from being murdered in their schools? #NeverAgain #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/qXHuEfhiBS
AR-15s were explicitly banned from 1994 to 2004. We need a new ban that closes the loopholes and draws a line in our history. We need a post-assault weapon America. #MSDStrong #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/Z7lLvRcN7p

.@speakerryan as you go from your fundraiser in Key Biscayne to the President's resort at Mar-a-Lago, consider a stop at #StonemanDouglas High School where 17 people were slaughtered in a mass shooting last Wednesday. I'll meet you there. https://t.co/Imc9Hmouc9
.@realdonaldtrump, we’ve both been invited to a town hall with the students, parents, &amp; teachers of #StonemanDouglas on 2/21. I’ll be there, will you? These kids have ideas about how to make our country safer. They deserve to hear from you about your ideas.
Now @realDonaldTrump you are President. Show that you can do better. Show you can do something to make Americans safer. Get @speakerryan @senatemajldr to hold votes. Let's see whose side everyone is on. https://t.co/9QZ2hYAGd4

Just 3 days after Parkland became home to one of the worst mass shootings in our history, a 600-booth gun show in Miami will offer AR-15s for sale to 18-year-olds. I’m introducing legislation to make 21 the minimum age for all firearm purchases. https://t.co/NybUcDJK4y

.@RepThompson, thank you for having the courage to call on the House to do the right thing.  It shouldn't take any more tragedies for Congress to take this epidemic seriously.  When I return to Washington, let's all take action to make our nation safer from gun violence. https://t.co/V64fop5DyL
While I am home in Parkland the House will pause for a moment of silence. I appreciate the thoughts &amp; prayers of my colleagues. I would also appreciate an open-minded willingness to work with me on gun violence legislation when I return to Washington.

Spoke with Parkland Mayor Hunschofsky who is on the scene.  First responders working to secure the school and keep everyone safe. Shooter still at large.
Still developing story at @StonemanDouglas #Stonemanshooting but heartbreaking news. Praying for all the students, teachers, and staff. Follow @BrowardSheriff for updates.

Something's wrong when a White House allows a man accused of abusing his wife to serve at the highest levels. It took the release of a graphic photo of a beaten woman for this White House to respond.

We’ve got just weeks to get this done. With tonight’s vote behind us, the DREAM Act must now be our singular focus until we do the right thing for DREAMers.   A promise from the Speaker is not enough. We need action.
Unfortunately, Republicans continue to ignore the moral call to find a legislative solution to the President's termination of DACA. It’s been five months since the President put DREAMers at risk. If Speaker Ryan brought the DREAM Act before Congress, I am confident it would pass.
Early this morning, I voted for a compromise budget deal because it will allow us to keep the government running, finally beyond just weeks. This bill includes critical funding for disaster recovery, veterans, medical research, and our troops.

The House of Representatives just unanimously passed legislation I co-introduced to strengthen responses to sexual harassment cases in Congress.  We are starting to change the culture by preventing future abuse and empowering victims to seek justice without fear of retribution. https://t.co/HsuWyjCdUn
It’s time to end protections for abusers and empower survivors.  Each survivor must be heard, allegations taken seriously, and abusers and harassers held accountable.  Everyone deserves the equal chance at success in their careers free from sexual harassment and retaliation.
This bill will allow survivors to speak out, ensure that legal resources are available to them, and offer justice without fear of retribution.   It will send an important message to the entire country that Members of Congress will be held accountable.
Speaking on House floor now on CAA Reform Act.  It does not matter what political party.  It does not matter what industry.  It does not matter when or where — sexual harassment and sexual violence are unacceptable.  I'm proud to have intro'd this reform bill in the House.
With our recent resolution, @RosLehtinen and I are calling on Argentine officials to fully investigate the murder of Alberto Nisman, who committed himself to holding Iran and its terror proxy, Hezbollah, accountable for the horrific 1994 AMIA bombing.

The world needs consistent, principled American leadership. We must stand squarely with our allies against autocratic regimes and fight for the democratic liberties we cherish here at home. #SOTU
Last year Congress voted 517-5 to impose new #RussianSanctions in response to its threats to our democracy and security. Yesterday, the President ignored that law. Today, he tells us he is strong on security. #actionnotrhetoric #SOTU
Despite his aggressive rhetoric, President Trump decided NOT to follow Congress’ bipartisan orders to impose #RussianSanctions for attacking our elections. #SOTU

I am heartbroken by the death of Otto Warmbier and grieve with the Warmbier family. We need total American resolve to bring Bob Levinson home to his family in Coral Springs. #SOTU

Quick bipartisan appreciation- Job training and vocational schools? Paid family leave? Criminal justice reform? Yes, yes, and yes. I agree. Let’s do it!
Donald Trump Claimed the U.S. is “restoring our … standing abroad.” Quick take from https://t.co/hV7lXyV8Ko: Actually, the number of foreigners telling pollsters they have a favorable view of the US fell nearly everywhere. The only big gain was in Russia. https://t.co/faO7G0LVLj
President Trump, listen to your own #SecDef Mattis: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition" #SOTU

The state of our union is stronger when we value the contributions of DREAMers and act on our compassion and core American values by welcoming them to become full members of our society. #SOTU #DREAMActNow
Deporting #DREAMers from Florida would cost our state’s economy $1.5 billion. Nationally, it would sap $460B from our GDP, and drain $24.6B from Social Security and Medicare contributions. #SOTU #DreamActNow
In recent negotiations President Trump said the solution to the #immigration debate should be a “bill of love.” It’s time to follow through with that sentiment to develop a bipartisan solution that allows #DREAMers to stay in the only home they’ve ever known. #SOTU #DreamActNow
The average age of #DREAMers when they arrived in the U.S. was 6 years old. They are workers, students, friends, neighbors, community leaders, and they are American in every way other than on paper. #SOTU #DreamActNow
Over 800,000 #DREAMers, including over 30,000 in Florida, are at risk of deportation to countries that are completely foreign to them. The end of DACA will not send them home; their home is the United States. #SOTU #DreamActNow

In addition to mass violence in the headlines, #gunviolence is a daily tragedy in our country. 96 Americans are killed with guns everyday. 13,000 Americans are killed with guns each year. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. #SOTU
Sutherland Springs was devastated by gun violence at a place of worship. And in only the first 3 weeks of 2018, there were 11 shootings in American schools. #SOTU
We cannot seriously discuss the state of the union without acknowledging the horror of gun violence. Since President Trump’s last address to a joint session of Congress, Las Vegas became the site of the worst mass shooting in our history at a music festival. #SOTU

What issue do you most want President Trump to address during tonight's #SOTU ?
Republicans on the House Oversight &amp; Gov Reform Committee need to step up, join Democrats, and demand that DHS release the information about Russia's attacks against American election infrastructure.
Russia attempted to hack 21 state election networks, including FL. Yet, Department of Homeland Security refuses to release the information election officials need to guard against the next attack.   https://t.co/fN3gPhqTe4

Though they control Congress and the White House, Republicans are governing by chaos, by creating shutdowns, and by catering to the far wings of their party. When they show no interest in governing in a bipartisan way, the American people lose.
We should all be deeply alarmed by my Republican colleagues’ attacks on the FBI.  When you look at how this Admin has led efforts discredit the press, the intelligence community, and now the FBI, their focus seems to be solely on protecting the President, not learning the truth.
This isn't about the 2nd Amendment. This is about the gun manufacturers' lobby driving the agenda in Congress.
Moments of silence on the House floor are followed by legislative silence by lawmakers.
There's so much that can be done to address gun violence that's just common sense. Yet five years after the tragedy at Sandy Hook, Congress has taken no action. And that's unacceptable.
Catch me live now with @MSignorile --&gt; https://t.co/uyoQhfvUru https://t.co/wkkiYzoxhu
Let's remember Bailey Nicole Holt and Preston Ryan Cope. And the 20 children and 6 educators who died at Sandy Hook. And all who have lost their lives in school shootings since. Our children should be safe at school. Americans deserve better from Congress. https://t.co/WB2JBqlUge

This bill will make it easier for victims to speak out, ensure that legal resources are available to them, and offer them a way to seek justice without fear of retribution. And when Members of Congress pay for their bad behavior, taxpayers will no longer foot the bill.
Everyone – from Congressional interns to Members of Congress – deserves a safe workplace environment free from harassment or abuse.
The Congressional Accountability Act passed almost a quarter of a century ago, and victims of sexual harassment in Congress have encountered a system with no transparency, little respect for the abused, and too many hurdles to seeking justice.
At a moment when women around the country are standing up to sexual harassment, Congress is finally taking action to strengthen our antiquated workplace protections.
Proud to introduce bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act today with @SusanWBrooks, @GreggHarper, @RepBrady, @RepSpeier, and @RepByrne. This bill will improve workplace protections in Congress and strengthen responses to sexual harassment cases.

You can read my full statement against the #GOPTaxScam here: https://t.co/5tDktNBV36.
Our job is to strengthen our country and improve the lives of the American people and help them succeed. Taking away healthcare and adding scores of additional giveaways to lobbyists in a tax code already stacked for the special interests clearly fails this test. I voted no. https://t.co/LTUORuBMnr
That's why thousands of my constituents have asked my to oppose the bill, 2,511 opposed to fewer than 100 in favor. I'll be voting against it this afternoon.
The #GOPTaxScam:  1. Give tax breaks to the wealthiest and corporations. 2. Explode the deficit. 3. Force middle class families and seniors to foot the bill. https://t.co/wVGNrMCzkQ
My statement on President Trump's omission of #climatechange as a national security threat in his National Security Strategy report: https://t.co/9faDN9mpV9
Mr. President, whether you accept evidence or not, climate change is an urgent national security threat. Removing it from our national security strategy will only make us less prepared to respond to threats to our communities and military installations. https://t.co/cnBfpwkUvX
Funds will run out soon if Congress doesn’t renew CHIP, meaning nearly 400,000 Florida kids could lose coverage. We've got to come together and reauthorize this vital program before the end of the year. https://t.co/z2mxe7swzP
When my Republican colleagues refer to the special counsel’s investigation as a “coup d’etat,” it really undermines the rule of law in our country.  As I told @AlexWitt on @MSNBC yesterday, Congress has a duty to protect the independence of Mueller's investigation. https://t.co/NcSKaNnRL4

Today we remember the children killed five years ago at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We must never forget what happened there. And we must always be committed to preventing this kind of gun violence from tearing more families apart. https://t.co/T1KMoJkzsM

For the sake of innovation, privacy, and a level playing field, we’ve got to ensure the internet remains free and open for all. That's why I'm outraged by @FCC's vote to overturn #NetNeutrality.
Perhaps the most gun lobby's most perverse myth is that the violence that traumatizes Americans every day is the price we must pay for the 2nd Amendment. The Second Amendment doesn't give the gun lobby a right to block reforms from consideration by Congress. #OutShoutTheGunLobby
I wrote this op-ed in 2015 calling for Congress to address gun violence. Two years later, Congress has still failed to take action. The best way we can honor the victims of Sandy Hook is to #HonorWithAction. https://t.co/EOdHgpReEB

The tax bill Sen. Hatch voted for this week isn't law yet. We could renew health care for 9,000,000 kids, but he'd rather cut taxes for billionaire political donors. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/NEp8uHBkwW
Let’s be honest about what the #GOPTaxPlan does. The $1.5 billion deficit hole will trigger automatic $150 billion cut to domestic programs, incl. $25 billion from Medicare. This shameful plan puts at risk the 55 million Americans who rely on Medicare. https://t.co/acQ0jIrxFo

The #GOPTaxScam triggers an automatic $25 billion Medicare cut. Speaker Ryan's plan is to trade severe Medicare cuts for massive giveaways to the wealthiest individuals and corporations.
The #GOPTaxScam would increase taxes for millions of middle-income Americans while giving wealthiest billions in breaks. Instead, we should be asking the highest-income Americans to pay into Social Security throughout the year, like everyone else. https://t.co/u2068VKQl4

The United States has long provided refuge for those fleeing dangerous conditions at home. I'm urging this Administration to make the humane choice to extend TPS for Haitians, including the many living in Florida.
By Thanksgiving Day, the Trump Admin must decide whether they will extend TPS for Haitians. With Haiti still recovering from the 2010 earthquake, the devastation caused by Hurricane Matthew, and the cholera outbreak, it goes against everything we stand for to send them back. https://t.co/GHJMhmOtXN

In short, the #GOPTaxScam give huge breaks to those who don’t need it, at the expense of those who desperately need it. We deserve a better deal - one that brings more jobs to America and higher wages to American workers. I opposed today's tax bill because it does the opposite.
The #GOPTaxScam would raise taxes on 992,000 Florida households next year in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations. And it would explode the deficit in the process.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill today.
618,450 Floridians claimed the student loan interest deduction in 2015 with an average deduction of $1,039.   But the #GOPTaxScam eliminates this deduction, too.
Over 2 million households in Florida deduct state and local taxes, with average deduction of $7,300.   But the #GOPTaxScam eliminates this deduction.

This follows GOP pattern of attacking abortion rights for all women. We should be equally outraged when they target an undocumented girl.

@HouseJudiciary We should scrap the bill and work on an ag visa program that protects US jobs, the agricultural industry, &amp; guestworkers from neglect.
@HouseJudiciary Is the majority going to inform shellfish industry workers in the Chesapeake Bay that they too will see massive pay cut or lose their jobs?
@HouseJudiciary Is the majority prepared to tell catfish industry workers along the Mississippi River and in Louisiana that they will lose their jobs?
@HouseJudiciary Is the majority prepared to inform forestry workers in the NW that wages for their dangerous job will be cut in half?
The Agricultural Guestworker Act will will destroy American jobs. I'm calling on @HouseJudiciary to scrap this bill &amp; protect US workers. https://t.co/4VZg7ImfqE

We cannot let our fellow Americans down. The administration must affirm its commitment to recovery.
When in PR, POTUS said, "we will be there all the time to help record, restore, rebuild." Now he tweets "we cannot keep FEMA in PR forever."
With difficult and dangerous situation ongoing, House aid package passed yesterday doesn't go far enough.
Puerto Rico still in great need: 37% w/o power; 91% w/o drinkable water; 4,681 miles of roads still closed.

@Bradybuzz "Americans have a right to live their lives from of the fear of gun violence. We can bring commonsense solutions to act on this epidemic."
@Bradybuzz "High capacity magazines aren't tools for self defense or sport. They're designed to cause damage - at schools, a theatre, and a concert."
.@Bradybuzz: "We know that if the American people come together to demand it, we can affect change. And that's what they're doing now."
.@Pride_Fund: "As an Iraq war eveteran, I fully believe high capacity magazines have no place on our streets. Americans must demand action."
.@CSGV: "The evidence shows that banning high-capacity magazine worked. Congress allowed the ban to expire. We can't accept this as normal."
.@moveon: "This legislation has teeth to it, and it's a battle we can win. The people of America are demanding action."
.@CAPActionGuns: "We can reduce the lethality of gun violence. Elected officials must stand against the NRA to protect Americans."
There's no singular remedy to end gun violence. But that doesn't mean we can't act. The Keep Americans Safe Act will make meaningful impact.
To my colleagues, I say: the time to act is today, tomorrow, and every day until Congress passes meaningful gun violence legislation.
If we did what voters sent us to do, we would have passed gun violence bills already. The American people have suffered too much already.
The new House routine seems to be send thoughts &amp; prayers, stand for a moment of silence, and then claim we can do nothing to end violence.
@RepJackyRosen "There's no reason to have high capacity magazines. It was wrong for this ban to lapse, and it's time for us to right that wrong."
.@RepJackyRosen: "It's urgent that we take meaningful action in passing gun safety measures. Thoughts and prayers are not enough."
@RepKihuen .@RepKihuen: "It is time for my colleagues to stop taking marching orders from the NRA" and take up #KeepAmericansSafeAct.
.@RepKihuen: "It's unacceptable that after 58 innocent victims lost their lives, we refuse to talk about common sense legislation."
.@repdinatitus: "If were serious about protecting our communities and keeping first responders safe, Congress needs to act."
@RepEsty .@repdinatitus: "I'm a gun owner, but I know we can have responsible measures to prevent gun violence," incl this bill.
@RepEsty: High capacity magazines serve no purpose but to cause mass casualties. Why do we have them in public spaces? #KeepAmericansSafeAct

He spoke powerfully about why we need the Dream Act of 2017 and the damage that cruelly revoking #DACA would do to over 800,000 Dreamers.
At my Town Hall last week, I heard from someone who immigrated to the US as child. He's undocumented, though this is the only home he knows.
I am extremely concerned by reports POTUS may end #DACA. Congress must work together to create path for permanent legal citizenship.
This is not us.  The goodness and unity on display in Texas is who we are.  Let's remain unified. We must #DefendDACA https://t.co/iIaPhEfDeV
Trump׳s DACA decision is inhumane. If he spoke to even one DREAMer he'd know it. If he had any feeling. If he could be empathetic. If only.

Hearing from lots of constituents at my Boca Town Hall right now who are fed up with the way Trump and his family disregard ethics rules.

I'm excited to be hosting the Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce's upcoming Summit in Washington, DC. https://t.co/YohFPKH5LV
Congress should vote on censuring the President. Rs and Ds alike should condemn his statements excusing racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism. https://t.co/mojv0TIek6
My father earned a Purple Heart fighting Nazis. This isn't complicated - it's a time for Rs and Ds to make clear we are appalled by POTUS.

I also urge AG Sessions to protect the 800,000 young people covered under DACA, who came to US as children and help make us great.
This paranoid President feels threatened by Americans exercising Constitutional rights. Now AG wants personal info of Inaug protesters.
And, we only know about this case because of litigation. How many other political opponents are POTUS &amp; Sessions going after using the DOJ?
With AG Sessions in South FL, I'm calling on him to use DOJ to go after Neo-Nazis, not Trump's political opponents https://t.co/bMxRkEufHF
Charlottesville must be a turning point. We can’t let POTUS ignore the violence of white supremacist terrorists. https://t.co/hjUx0BXRet

Moreover, AG Sessions's decision should alarm all Americans who value their rights to privacy and protection from government overreach.
When govt attempts to seize personal info for millions, it shows POTUS is willing to use DOJ to go after political opponents.
Protesters of Trump inaug were exercising Constitutional rights. So were organizers who used website to coordinate. https://t.co/atlLFFnxnT
Failure of GOP ACA repeal bill in July was a big moment, but the fight isn’t over. Trump can still sabotage ACA.
Cost Sharing Reduction payments aren’t a bailout for insurance companies. They're a discount to address high health care costs.
CBO today: Premiums will spike 20% if Trump pulls cost sharing reduction payments. https://t.co/oq3MXGM6iF
This was never about statues. And the President knows it.
Will @POTUS look into the eyes of an American beaten &amp; jailed fighting for civil rights and tell him that even one Confederate flag is OK?
Will @POTUS look into the eyes of a Holocaust survivor and tell her that even one Nazi swastika flag is OK?
Today @POTUS provided cover to Nazis and the Klan. When they march, no other information is necessary. Condemn them. Full stop.
If @POTUS nominated someone to his Cabinet who spoke the way he did today, that person would NEVER be confirmed. This an embarrassing low. https://t.co/JnipA5TzPk

@UF 6) Finally, I'm hopeful for progress in Congress. #ClimateSolutions Caucus, which I co-chair, proves this can be a bipartisan issue.
@UF 5) We have reasons to be hopeful that progress is being made. Cities, states, businesses leaders have pledged to meet Paris agreement goals.
@UF 4) Which is why I had urged POTUS to not withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. But, as I said at showing of Inconvenient Sequel...
@UF 3) Study reports: ocean rise worldwide is "consequence of the warming of the planet caused by the human release of greenhouse gases"

I've been urging Gov Scott and other FL Republican leadership to expand Medicaid for years. In 2013, I wrote about mental health needs: https://t.co/ubIJk4urhW
We need to address overdose as a public health crisis. To succeed we must defeat #TrumpCare and expand Medicaid.
@SunSentinel If #TrumpCare passes, FL will have missed its opportunity to expand care to 800,000. 300k of them need mental health/addiction care.

Here's a FL voter's story I shared during Scott's attempted 2012 purge of legitimate voters from the rolls: https://t.co/bQiWBxEe8r
I fear Trump's voter fraud commission's goal is voter suppression. And Gov Scott is happy to join in by putting Floridians' info at risk.
Given Kobach's and Scott's history, the apparent goal is voter suppression &amp; intimidation.   This is just the start https://t.co/JeqyV39zOR
Given Kobach's record - and Scott's own record - the apparent goal is voter suppression and intimidation. And @FLGovScott happily complied.
Why?? We know Trump's claim about 3 million illegal voters is bogus. That's why so many states rejected the commission's outrageous request. https://t.co/fx7MKx4JOs
Angry that Scott has agreed to deliver to Trump's commission the name, address, age &amp; party of EVERY FLORIDA VOTER https://t.co/IPr9gzFZdL
@OfficeGovEthics Congress needs to hold executive branch accountable to high ethics standards. My bill would require POTUS nominees to disclose fundraising. https://t.co/97uPjm8Llp

The @MiamiHeraldOp sums it up succinctly: "Hell, no." https://t.co/cTyrue4FF0
Governor Scott should listen to so many voices concerned about FL voters' privacy. This shouldn't be partisan. https://t.co/3KeZKXzHHw
@RepHastingsFL @RepLoisFrankel @RepDWStweets @RepCharlieCrist @USRepKCastor @RepAlLawsonJr 4. We share Scott's goal of “100 percent participation and zero percent fraud.” But violating the privacy of FL voters is not the right way.
@RepHastingsFL @RepLoisFrankel @RepDWStweets @RepCharlieCrist @USRepKCastor @RepAlLawsonJr 3. The President's commission is reminiscent of Gov Scott’s efforts to purge valid voters from Florida’s registration rolls in 2012.
@RepHastingsFL @RepLoisFrankel @RepDWStweets @RepCharlieCrist @USRepKCastor @RepAlLawsonJr 2. Even the State of Kansas, whose Secretary of State is vice chair of the commission, has refused to provide certain voter info.
@RepHastingsFL @RepLoisFrankel @RepDWStweets @RepCharlieCrist @USRepKCastor @RepAlLawsonJr 1. President Trump established this commission in spite of having no evidence whatsoever that widespread voter fraud has occurred.
Most states have declined to send sensitive voter info to President Trump's bogus commission. We're calling on Gov Scott to do the same. https://t.co/v46vMYwbEr

Congress shouldn't attempt to balance budget on the backs of seniors &amp; families who need help getting on their feet. https://t.co/KEUvq2DgQF
Pretty straightforward - give POTUS the opportunity to say this under oath instead of on Twitter. No character limit and chance to ask q's. https://t.co/OzzNlvXQR6
Yesterday House Republicans passed the #WrongCHOICE Act to roll back Wall Street regulations. I voted no because consumers deserve better. https://t.co/VNATxVBLuS

We're leaving the Paris Agreement so we can negotiate to be part of the Paris Agreement?  That's the argument?  We have chosen to retreat.
