This Zion Williamson situation has #Nike premarket stock down 1.37% this morning. @Nike is a $130 Billion market cap which means that’s almost 3 billion dollars. @boardroom @espn
This Zion Williamson injury is exactly why players should be able to go directly to the @nba from high school. The league needs to change this rule. PERIOD @GetUpESPN @espn

The 2019 @celtics are drastically different than the 2018 #Celtics. 75% of their FGs are assisted which ranks #1 in the league. Last 4 games avg 10 more ast per game since their team meeting.
People hate that we talk about Zion Williamson so much &amp; I don’t get it. His PER is 43.1. Let me say that again. It’s 43.1. 👀. The avg PER is 15. Zion’s PER is the highest in recorded history of college basketball. #Facts @GetUpESPN

@jaitai0609 @Stephen_tLiu @GetUpESPN Stop sensationalizing. I said duke could beat the bottom part of the Cavs team. They had about 67 players out due to injuries.
I disagree. Ingram might be the most attractive asset bc of his ceiling plus Lonzo &amp; draft picks. Kuzma is the most complimentary piece to Lebron bc of his ability to catch &amp; off LBJ’s driving ability. https://t.co/tJwqHKczaZ

😂😂😂😂 @Klow7 https://t.co/jvzBfXRpQj
Please tell me you guys agree... Kevin Durant is the most gifted scorer the @nba has ever seen.
I mean a win is a win for the @Raptors but this game makes me somewhat concerned abt the best team in the east struggling to beat a @warriors team w/o Steph &amp; Draymond.
Sometimes you should listen to the answer instead of just associating the question with the first name out of someone’s mouth. Context is everything. @rayfordyoung https://t.co/my7PbEMriB
And I love the way @TheTraeYoung plays. He is going to be a big time player &amp; I take nothing personal with @rayfordyoung. He is a good man w/ a great family that I respect.  &amp; one last thing, the only PGs I said I would take  Collin Sexton &amp; Luka. https://t.co/my7PbEMriB
That was the question but you apparently you didn’t hear the way I answered it. I said his numbers at 38% FG &amp; 25% from 3 were somewhat of a struggle but Steph didn’t come into his own until his third yr. @rayfordyoung https://t.co/my7PbEMriB

NBA Thoughts:  - I will say it... it’s just damn time to blow up the @WashWizards PERIOD! - For all of those who don’t think Jimmy Butler will get max money... sorry but you are wrong regardless the drama playing out
Thoughts:  - KU will won the @Big12Conference for the 15th straight year even with FBI probe looming like an ominous cloud - MSU plays hard but have to be more together due to lack of talent to fight for a @bigten chip - Zags = #BeastMode
Thoughts:  - Ahh Duke’s Reddish, Barrett and Williamson combined for 83 pts which means they almost beat Kentucky by themselves.  #ScaryGood - Nothing better than getting your team’s attention than what occurred last night for Cal and his Wildcats #BBN

This Jimmy Butler situation will be the gift that just keeps on giving as long as he is playing for @Timberwolves 👀  @SportsCenter

To all the people that keep saying the McEnroe video was a different era... there are a plethora of examples. Here is @rogerfederer in the heat of an argument. Is what @serenawilliams said worse? https://t.co/D0si0mZ9Ef
In case some people need a history lesson on how some other players handled themselves in the past. Slams the racket &amp; no warning. Then McEnroe gets unsportsmanlike conduct.. then he curses at the ref &amp; nothing happens. @espn @usopen https://t.co/KpwY4OWMHm
Like John McEnroe or Andre Agassi used to berate refs. I don’t need to have played tennis at the #USOpen to see what happened yesterday. https://t.co/bQJO4hqv4Z
#GarciaPorter 👀👀👀
Her emotions got the best of her.... but the way she handled the post match interview was superb. Didn’t make it about her but rather gave credit where it belong &amp; that was to Naomi. https://t.co/gWha6d9KU2
. @serenawilliams = 🔥🔥🔥🔥 &amp; just flat out CLASS all the way around. PERIOD!!! #USOpenChampionship
This @usopen ....  just... wow... all the way around. Congrats to Naomi but this chair umpire was on one. Players should be able to show emotion. Breaking a racket isn’t a big deal. The rules need to evolve w/ the game of tennis.
Give him that work @russwest44 https://t.co/Z5DHnilZAI

Let me say this... I have been on record stating that this @warriors are the best team of all time &amp; have no hate at all for them &amp; Boogie taking advantage of the cap &amp; the @nba rules.. but.. Adam Silver needs to find a way to better equally distribute talent in the league. @espn
It’s time for Adam Silver to step in &amp; not allow this to happen anymore. @warriors #ThisIsRidiculous #NBA
And just like that.......the @Lakers became the best reality show on television. #MarkItDown

Let’s talk about this in ten years when kids just remember @StephenCurry30 &amp; @KDTrey5 for winning championships. No ones legacy is hurting. https://t.co/L6zptlQ8QF
Company founder would imply that he starting it &amp; was passionate abt it from the beginning. He was drafted here and that wasn’t by his choice. https://t.co/i2q3sWLZVg
Let’s humanize @KDTrey5 for a minute. Here is the reason why he left @okcthunder for the @warriors / @Apple . Yes.. I compared the #Warriors to #Apple @espn https://t.co/TuisI8Q2T7
Not the case. Actually when I got hurt only made 40k a year with espn for the first 6 yrs of my career and I had another 9-5 job at @24hourfitness ... so yes I have an idea. https://t.co/NluCfEIHcl

Said it on @FirstTake ... @GraysonJAllen to play alongside @spidadmitchell makes there backcourt so much tougher all the way around plus is a shooter to play with Ricky &amp; Sousa’s ability to beat people off the dribble. https://t.co/ARWnbUmLzL
Love the situation for Brunson but also think DD is in the perfect position for the @Bucks .. combo guard is what they needed. https://t.co/9SAlBhDGa3
Agreed. https://t.co/jqBhqtGL5i
Small ball yes but still needs to work on skill set: ball handling &amp; play making but overall I love his determination. He will stay in the gym. https://t.co/r9WjbUJyGW
Shooting will always be the question looming around him but I like his fire. He will need to be able to play the 3 though which will be interesting to watch him develope. Doesn’t move the needle right away but could eventually. https://t.co/GXygk4RcT6

Not saying this pertains to Trevon but not every kid can be as patient as the system (NCAA) projects they should be. Some players have families that struggle &amp; they need financial support that the school can’t provide. https://t.co/SJeaoXG6E3
Super talented.. questionable shooting but he has to look at it that now he can get big money faster.  The kid has all the tools. https://t.co/MtM1N481ji

Everyone was right &amp; I was wrong. Thought this was special yr for Bron &amp; I jumped on board but KD was on another level tonight. This series is officially over. All hail to the Champions = @warriors

It just feels like it’s a matter of time b4 @warriors catches fire &amp; blows it open.
It’s hard to try and win games when the refs won’t let you. That was ridiculous. #NBAFinals
The @Cavs can’t win with Lebron looking mortal like he did in the 1st half. He has to do more. Just FYI.. his mortal #s are close to a triple double. #Scary @espn
So the guys who are suppose to be the enforcers for the @Cavs .. Kevin Love &amp; Tristan Thompson both have zero fouls in the first half. So much for that.. @espn
The @cavs played pathetic defense in the 1st quarter &amp; allowed the @Warriors easy dunks &amp; 65% FGs... only down 4.

He has never played against someone like Lebron. 6’9 260 who moves like a guard &amp; is undermineded when it comes to his determination. https://t.co/C39HPsKsUc
It’s disappointing that’s the only intellectual thought you ideated to engage in a debate. If you handed in a homework like this &amp; I were your teacher, I would hand it back &amp; tell you that you could do better. https://t.co/21zMP19nRR

Who would your first pick in 2018 @NBADraft be???  @ESPNNBA @espn https://t.co/xobKdYTrGh
I love that Marcus Smart is Draymond Green for the @Celtics. Every great team needs someone with that 🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥 inside of them to enforce &amp; fight for their teammates. @espn
I can’t wait for this @CP3 &amp; @StephenCurry30 matchup. @espn
Yo... this is some alien stuff right here. @ESPNNBA https://t.co/BP5HkFxqWZ
As much as I want to see Lebron James in the #NBAFinals... I much rather see the @Celtics play either @warriors or the @HoustonRockets just bc they play so much harder &amp; have better pieces to match up with either. @espn
The power of the mind only builds a stronger foundation to leverage one’s position. #Leverage https://t.co/p06rCC2CYW
What the other coaches in the @nba did to Brad Stevens is an absolute shame. Dwayne Casey had a good yr BUT there is no way in hell that Brad Stevens from the @Celtics shouldn’t of been Coach of the Yr yet alone not get a single vote. 🤔🤔🤔 #Conspiracy @espn #ColdBlooded
I don’t think Toronto was “thinking” too much at all. https://t.co/cPMBpv3AHu
A different reality for him than other. I see that. https://t.co/m1rZuEaXlu
We have NEVER see someone like Lebron James. NEVER. People can find so many ways to hate on him but you have a chance to watch one of the greatest to EVER do it. #Strive4Greatness @espn
The @Raptors ... are flat out never going to get by Lebron &amp; the @Cavs. As long as LBJ is in that uniform. @ESPNNBA

If you had to bet money on one team making the @nba finals, who would you take: the @cavs or the @warriors ???  Injuries &amp; a crazy road for the #Warriors &lt; the #Cavs w/ the @Celtics no longer in the picture &amp; not trusting in the @Raptors ..
So stoked to watch the @TheMasters today. Tigers first T Shot was not so bueno.

. @NovaMBB has already tied the record for most made 3’s in the history of the #Finalfour w/ 13. And they just have 17 made FGs. #HotDamn @espn
Respect to @umichbball for finding a way to win ugly &amp; ride the back of Mo. That being said.. they need to play a lot better on Monday night versus either Nova or KU.
Truth. Last player to have 20 pts and 15 rebs in the semi of the @FinalFour was Hakeem Olajuwon. https://t.co/NCbTCrxFfM
Oh I love @KUHoops ... but when we picked teams to win the championship, @SethOnHoops picked them first before I said anything &amp; I got worried. He hasn’t picked them the whole year. Now he does??🤔🤔🤔. I had to go w/ @NovaMBB https://t.co/7WV5YrrStg

The women’s colllege game is so much further advanced than the men’s game. Advancing the ball after TOs &amp; quarters. Sad that our game can’t catch up.
Best of luck to Darius Bazley... people can be angry &amp; hate all they want but the kid &amp; his family made the best decision for them. That’s all that matters.

Love how life comes full circle. My first car was an @Acura and now I am behind the wheel of a #TLX. #WhataRide #AcuraPartner https://t.co/ACKS7hFwD7
My idea was just the bracket... not the number of games in the series. https://t.co/jUaJCNWIm9
This is what the NBA needs to do. The current playoffs format is archaic &amp; stale. Who would win this @nba #Bracket if each series was just one game? https://t.co/JWXeABns75
A huge congrats to @Iam1Cent on taking the @Memphis_MBB head coach position.
😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/n2uWUE36Qf
It’s not a 1 game series like college my man. https://t.co/T5lMxUhEmz
Exactly. Crazy athletic teams but the skill level in our college &amp; grassroot games are dwindling by the second. A lot of bad basketball. https://t.co/eTMcd0j6H6
Like I said a month ago... this is going to be one of the craziest tournaments of all time. @SportsCenter
I am oooh too familiar with that @FSUHoops Seminole chant... bc you know you were about to lose. What a ball game. Another #1 seed goes down in @XavierMBB
That’s a veteran classy move. https://t.co/5RDLRk0B9C

#Brotherhood 👀👀👀
Me just watching people’s brackets go... https://t.co/vKDRLgYJvg
Like I said before... regardless of whether you thought @Cuse_MBB belonged in the tourney or not... all these dudes do this time of year is win. @MSU_Basketball go down. @SportsCenter
. @tyusbattle1 - moxy. Way to rep @StJoesMetuchen
The next 30 for 30 = @umichbball potentially playing @UNC_Basketball in the #Sweet16 with the hopes that @cbs will let Chris Webber call the game.
I hear you on that brother. Well the doors wide open for your squad. https://t.co/sCS3WkHPE6
@catbacker77 @KStateMBB Did you listen to the rest of my comment or just get hung up on “rim protector” bc I said that just his size alone deters shots. Rim protector could be defined in different ways man. Good luck to your squad.
@catbacker77 @KStateMBB Not having a guy 6’10 on the floor defensively hurts any team’s paint defense even if he is more of perimeter oriented offensively.
Loyola Chicago continues to shock the world. God bless you sister Jean. @SportsCenter

This has a chance to be one of the best tournaments ever... pure chaos.

Marshall has no conscious when it comes to shooting the 3. It’s seems like the 13 over the 4 is the pick of this tournament. @espn #BracketsBusted
Wichita State just got so screwed. The ball was out on Marshall and the replay showed it a dozen times. Wow.

It’s not just about boycotting.... it’s how you boycott. I will explain on the 6pm @SportsCenter w/ @michaelsmith @espn #PlayersStandTogether #NCAA
If the players boycotted the NCAA tournament, it would bring drastic sweeping change but the players first would need to form “a union” type organization to get on the same page.

I completely agree with Jeff Van Gundy. Allow refs to go back &amp; make a foul call but only if they're in the last 3 minutes of a game. That missed foul on KD against LBJ would never happen or any tough call for that matter. @ESPNNBA

Duke is so gifted offensively but it will come down to their players making defense a PRIORITY that will determine if they are championship worthy. BC shot 51% FGs &amp; 58% from the 3pt line.
Great win for Boston College vs Duke but the lights going off in the stadium as BC fans stormed the court should never be allowed. Security couldn’t have any clue what may happen &amp; their response time would be limited.
Boston College has won a total of just 10 games in the ACC for the past 4 yrs but are in the verge of beating Duke.. the number 1 team in the nation.

This is not even a decision for James Dolan. W/o hesitation... the @Knicks need to go after David Griffin &amp; get going NOW . @MikeAndMike
Phil Jackson did this job for the $$$. The @Knicks have finally made the right move by parting ways but now I wonder what Dolan is thinking.

The #Heels are looking @FinalFour bound. This @UNC_Basketball squad's defense has risen to new heights. #SoImpressive #UNCvsUK
Is Malik Monk on the court? He has to go get the ball. It's his time. #UNCvsUK
. @UNC_Basketball 's defense is at a level I've never seen this team play. Justin Jackson is taking this matchup w/ Monk so seriously.
All for a great game but do the refs have UNC winning in their bracket or something. @finalfour #UNCvsUK
Straight-up running and gunning. UNCvsUK
Did I just see Justin Jackson barking back at Malik Monk? Yeah.... Can feel the intensity. #Talkthat

A lot of tweets from me Mike Murphy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Why you so angry? https://t.co/BM8QEGIHH2
Congrats to Frank Martin &amp; the @GamecockMBB for a big time victory. The #SEC &amp; #Big10 have 3X more teams in the sweet 16 than the ACC. @espn
Lmao https://t.co/9uBvGiXIJL
That's exactly my point. The refs know that the players are going to foul w/ the intent to stop the clock. #CommonSense https://t.co/lDfIppvqCF
Either it's one way or the other @NCAA. The rule should not be a rule. Same scenario in the #WisconsinvsNova game occured. #NoPlayonBall
Big contradiction: If #SteonHallvsArkansas was called a "Flagrant 1" then #USCvsBaylor should've been a flagrant 1 also. No play on the ball
Tyler Dorsey w/ a clutch 3 pt shot to help @OregonMBB survive and advance in the #NCAA tournament. Closed game with 7-0 run in last 2 mins.
Of course not Mike. https://t.co/n2wKOsrDVP
A lot of bad calls across the board today in multiple games!
Yes sir!! https://t.co/HASceAeWmy
Stop it Ben. Come on man. You guys are hysterical. That should've of been a charge or walk on Berry. Always keepin it real. https://t.co/CXKWAnqWxL
Agreed!! https://t.co/E47FGEmzva
Josh Jackson tho..... wow. #Best2wayplayer @ESPNCBB @KUHoops looking sharp.
Agreed that WSU was not seeded correctly. #deadwrong No way they were a 10 seed. https://t.co/mwMddk3toI
They aree a #7 seed man. C'mon. https://t.co/WqChlvSn69
DEFENSE wins the game for @KentuckyMBB .. This squad has grown leaps &amp; bounds. Great game #WSUvsUK
Damn Fox!!!!! Top 5, top 5 @SportsCenter
. @GoShockers bring the ball up the court w/ absolute 0 pressure. The pace is a very COMFORTABLE 4 the #shockers. UK needs 2 speed it up.
How do you determine best conference? Teams in the final four? Teams in the sweet 16? Or the team that wins the whole thing? https://t.co/UTvLSj6rHu
It's all good. Didn't know it was Few's 500th but will explain tomorrow on @MikeAndMike Always open for a good convo. https://t.co/07rJCn6JTE
Stoked for the rematch @GoShockers vs @KentuckyMBB #letsgetit
The ACC started the NCAA Tournament with 9 teams, most of any conf, &amp; now are 0-4 in the Round of 32. Duke &amp; UNC are the only 2 left. @espn
This @umichbball dream continues it miraculous run!!! The 3 Ws do it again =  Walton, Wagner &amp; Wilson w/ the closing FTs. @marchmadness
You challenge the play at the official desk. Next dead ball forces the refs to review the play challenged. https://t.co/WIVo6N0xb1
Guilty as charged. My apologies 2 @ZagMBB . I didn't know tonight was Mark Few's 500th win. #Cause4celebration
That St. Mary's vs Arizona was the most high level game I have seen all yr. I underestimated St Marys. #Respect
. @ZagMBB looking really good.
That's not the point. It's a business for the coach, school, conferences, NCAA but... the public doesn't think it should be for the players. https://t.co/7xDGla0srG

WOW... @BadgerMBB who lost their last 6 out of 10 games in the #BIG10 Thanks to Hayes &amp; Koenig are abt to beat @NovaMBB . #Welcome2Madness

Agreed. That's total BS Gary. Sad you guys missed out on that Blue Ribbon Brownie for desert. #YourBetterThanThat #Applebees4Life https://t.co/UhyR7m7h1R
Do you watch end of tight basketball games in general? You just try to foul quickly to stop the clock. Happens in every end game situation. https://t.co/OOsmsozOiz
The trip was incidental contact &amp; the #SetonHall player made a quick foul. Sad when refs determine outcomes of games w/ a bad whistle.
What an absolute horrific call by the officials on #SetonHall .. No damn way that was a "Flagrant 1" foul at the end of the game. #pathetic
A dream game = #OklahomaState vs #Michigan No Defense &amp; straight offensive showcasing on fleek. @espn
. @BaylorMBB flirting w/ upset city down by 2 vs New Mexico State at the half. The Aggies shooting hot fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes!!!!! !!!!!! https://t.co/YhvlqV6DKW
Feel absolutely horrible for Matthew Fisher-Davis. Wow. #MarchMadness #VandyvsNorthwestern  @ESPNCBB
And @NDmbb survive &amp; advance.
Jimmy Butler is just a passenger on the @chicagobulls bus.  Scored 1 pt in last 8 mins vs @memgrizz. Almost a no show since trade deadline.

I don't have that in my bracket but we had to pick a potential upset. Welcome to Sportscenter. https://t.co/5NstpLDaXj
It's Bracket breakdown this am on @GMA https://t.co/5yxjpLRIeK
No. This means Duke should be in the same midwest w/ KU &amp; Luoisville should be in the east with Nova. https://t.co/OMJPlqy9Ov
This is the S Curve that the @NCAA came out with:  The seeding makes no sense for teams like Duke, FSU, Baylor, &amp; Minnesota. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 https://t.co/iwl5csfDK8
. @Cuse_MBB got absolutely hosed. I don't care about their record away from home. 6 wins vs top 50 in the ACC proves they can beat anyone.
This Midwest region is looking pretty LOADED for @KUHoops
The committee just said that @DukeMBB is the weakest 2 seed by pairing them with the #1 overall seed @NovaMBB. Elite 8 game = @TheGarden
Moses Kingsley should be kicked out of the game for that. @BBN #ArkansasvsKentucky #ridiculous
Today is the day: #MarchMadnessChallenge @espn @SportsCenter @ESPNCBB https://t.co/czxLG1xl6F

Yes if they led the NATION in top 50 wins which is 13. https://t.co/3wtdVq1mmf
Schools do it. Why can't individual players? https://t.co/0EhKUSBNDq
Every1 documents their life, so why do people hate on the Ball family 4 doing the same &amp; monetizing off of it. Bc the @NCAA says so? Please! https://t.co/sa7zgB8X9z
2 separate arguments. Never said just because you win your conference means you deserve a number 1 seed. https://t.co/RKABdmHSeJ
Considering the way the committee has ALWAYS been... politically, too much egg would be on their face if they weren't a number 1 seed https://t.co/h1bGRVU3oV
I think Duke bc of their # of quality wins SHOULD be a 1 seed but the reality is that they WON'T. They will be high on the 2 line. @espn
Guard play goes a long long way. Getting Josh Jackson (a top 5 #NBAdraft pick) back helps big time. https://t.co/ZBqN4AQfRD
They bring it every damn day. #Respect https://t.co/AQZH6XsX0a
I am with you Joe. I want Mark Few &amp; company to make a final 4. A 2 seed in the west wouldn't put so much pressure on them. https://t.co/0vWwdbuLsy
Its Selection Sunday people!!!! Before the brackets are released, who is your favorite to win it all? @espn
8 wins vs the top 50 is the most of any school in the nation plus you have to consider the unbalanced schedule in the ACC. https://t.co/6cGQPkCDQC

Kevin.... bc cursing doesn't occur in college basketball. Please. Slamming a ball &amp; trying to catch it is not a technical foul. https://t.co/EidpJ0hD8c
That's a BAD call on Grayson Allen. That was NO technical foul &amp; trust me, I would tell you if it was or not. #Ridiculous

@ESPN1050_Ryan I spoke about Illinois St on tv man. Come on.
Made 9 3s when they beat Gonzaga??? Haven't seen St Mary's do that. @BYUbasketball personnel &amp; tempo is better suited to beat @ZagMBB https://t.co/zlXDq2wyoG
Not college football. https://t.co/97pq9u1tkC
It's against the field guys. Illinois St played a mere 6 gms vs top 100 opponents. (2-4) in those gms. Best wins = Wichita st &amp; New Mexico https://t.co/AhxbRCYccD
The @spurs are quietly just winning games while @cavs &amp; @warriors have injury issues. #JustSaying @MikeAndMike https://t.co/RgeWPmHQmp
Andrew Bogut helped off court in Cavs debut, undergoing X-rays.... Barely a min into his @cavs career. @MikeAndMike
Yes. Still have a conf tourney but that winner gets the AQ for the NIT. Let's value the 3 month reg season more than a 3 gms in 3 day stint. https://t.co/6T9V8cyk20
I understand your point Jack BUT teams that win the regular season should get the AQ while the conf tournament winner gets the NIT bid. https://t.co/bHXq9SJTc0
Prime example = Belmont. Dominated their conference at 15-1 but the @NCAA doesn't get the best representation from the #OVC. https://t.co/gY9UCNFFuT
Conf tourneys are a cash grabbing attempts by the conf 2 artificially inflate the excitement for college ball. It devalues reg season. @espn
#Standup4Jersey I love it CB. https://t.co/T0N5QzGSrT

Exactly. If we want the best teams from smaller conferences in the #NCAAs then the AQ's should go to the reg season champion. https://t.co/TS2b4ekozp

Just like it was my take when I picked Duke to beat UNC in Cameron. Didn't hear you complain then. https://t.co/Lbd4uybiGS
Ahhh because UNC is in 1st place of the ACC &amp; is in the conversation for a # 1 seed because of Justin Jackson. https://t.co/gJ20fbBXQV

Please. I have no slight against anyone. You are wrong. I want D Rose to be great &amp; it is difficult in that horrible system. https://t.co/yGdmYhX6ij
It's that triangle offense. Takes the ball out of your hands if you're a PG. that's why he has to create more in transition. https://t.co/4w7wNtOmcM

Magic already making power moves for the @lakers by hiring Rob Pelinka. Naturally ties @kobebryant back into the franchise.
I never said that. I don't know what you are talking about Chris. https://t.co/RFX0wNlY2w
The @WashWizards not being able to get a deal done for Lou Williams is a huge miss. Could of done wonders for a team lacking bench scoring.
I said they play at Kansas next. No signature wins &amp; only 2 vs the top 50 rpi. Next two games are at @KUHoops &amp; they host @WestVirginiaU https://t.co/3YSPw25Tbm
Another offensive option doesn't hurt. Patrick Beverley &amp; Trevor Ariza will have to be great defensively in #nbaplayoffs @HoustonRockets https://t.co/TfDVqAaZ3j
This is scary for the west. Adding the 6th man of the year with Eric Gordan &amp; James Harden = #nextlevelteam https://t.co/7Bslf1IJs2

Paul Pierce didn't lead the league in technical fouls 5 or the past 6 yrs like Boogie. https://t.co/XeXeYD3FIb
You are wrong about that one. https://t.co/ZxtmULxKmu
It was his attitude. Never his performance w/ points &amp; rebs. What would give us any indication that his attitude will change? https://t.co/4q36vGn2pU

I actually picked Louisville to go DEEP in the #NCAAtourney BUT their defense today was not good vs VaTech. See for yourself. https://t.co/vAfXeSGdvR

Yo..... what is Draymond Green wearing? Think I just saw a 6'8 version of Prince (r.i.p) walk out on the court.😂
Backups in the league make 40 to 50 million dollars. When did that become a bad thing? https://t.co/K9SZgxdw7c

I did. He is a playmaker. PGs, SGs, SFs, PFs are all antiquated. Versatility is the way of the #nba https://t.co/oA2l5FkFJI

@nyknicks statement: "We hope he gets help"? Are you kidding me. Oakley may have reacted wrongly but this was a CLASSLESS move. #sad
Charles Oakley was flat out WRONG for reacting the way he did &amp; the @nyknicks statement was a straight EMBARRASSMENT for the organization.
Name me a team president (Phil Jackson) that constantly takes shots at his star player (Carmelo Anthony)? @nyknicks = a dysfunctional family

My exact point. https://t.co/7z9vPaTGg6
Well he will have a chance regardless of opinions. https://t.co/VkyyEZ93NX
#InterestingPoint But it was only a couple of weeks ago he wanted only to serve as an advisor. Not saying he can't figure. https://t.co/g3OA8ZTLhB
Fair point. But that far outside the box? https://t.co/pEGqbBiWm9
Completely understand that he was offered other positions BUT you should meet qualifications &amp; have some sort of experience. https://t.co/KLcu26W9jA
to the racial &amp; social tension that has been stirred from his campaign. https://t.co/bSERmemFOY
Carson is not qualified for this position &amp; I think the trump admin should be more diverse in its admin but also cautious of placements due https://t.co/bSERmemFOY
Yes he is black but just bc someone grew up in an urban housing doesn't make them qualified run a department w/ no experience. https://t.co/bSERmemFOY
Qualified?? He has no experience in government or running a large bureaucracy. https://t.co/OlC92frmHc
Not about divide. I am all for inclusion but I can still vehemently disagree with the selection for the role of "urban development". https://t.co/iUpgzv1j69
This is so stereotypical. The 1st position a black man takes in @realDonaldTrump admin is head of "URBAN Development". https://t.co/oJymoCrTQ4
Since the selection process for @ESPNCFB is final, who has the best chance to dethrone @AlabamaFTBL :
Apparently winning the best conf in the nation doesn't mean anything. Just wish the committee would articulate their value system. https://t.co/dGqXDdor6e

Last time @UVAMensHoops let a team shoot 60% for the half was in the year 2008. @OhioStateHoops played excellently in the 1st half. @ESPNCBB
. @IndianaMBB dominating the boards vs @UNC_Basketball plus Josh Newkirk is doing an incredible job harassing Joel Berry. @ESPNCBB @espn
I stand corrected. #fair https://t.co/Go0zkAw9i3
Maryland lost 63% of scoring from last yr. Don't have 4 of 5 starters from last year. Good win 4 @pitt but a game they should EXPECT to win. https://t.co/axY6lPVivT

Interesting way to kick off a debate by name calling. I see you have been paying attention to the presidential debates. #Pitt should be #MD. https://t.co/5Ivi6Zir3y

If you want change in your life:   Stop complaining. Start doing. Change your habits &amp; remind yourself constantly of your destination.
Like I said, @KUHoops ' backcourt of Frank Mason &amp; Devonte Graham are the best court in the country. Kids are really good. @ESPNCBB
The reason why @DukeMBB is losing to @KUHoops (the paint/2nd chance points) &amp; no fast break points for the devils. Nothing easy. https://t.co/f2pEbNi81l

@coachJS20 You are missing the point. The system will go on monetizing off these kids for the coaches &amp; programs. Why is that right? Tell me
Actually I was forced to play. My parents couldn't afford the tuition at Duke and it was mandatory I go to college for a yr from the @NBA. https://t.co/YP1M0i1o6L
Wrong. My schedule everyday was a job. 6-9 am &amp; 3-6 pm workouts, 7-8 tape, travel, missed classes. It's more of a job than you think. https://t.co/1K3LFMo1xZ
No one is comparing the fight of students but that doesn't make it right for people to capitalize off these athletes https://t.co/nyuvrtzvl9
Thank you! https://t.co/UlHWjaAW9t
Waaaay tooooo much sense! https://t.co/ifsMvvxN9U
Abide by those team rules then your portion of revenue goes back into the bucket. Create a new curriculum for athletes &amp; make it mandatory.
Certain GPA while abiding by all team rules then you can capitalize on that percentage BUT if you leave early, do not maintain that GPA or
Incentivize players by allocating a designated % of the programs revenue over their 4 yr time span. If you graduate while maintaining a
Actually the athletes are treated like a business. I am sorry. The business of exploitation. https://t.co/fzlxKUWMRW
Still pales in comparison to what athletic programs &amp; the university generate. Everything else is treated like a business but the athletes. https://t.co/fzlxKUWMRW
Coaches make mils. Athletic directors make mils. A lot of revenue being shared but the athletes who generate it don't get any? #BAMAvsTENN https://t.co/bpdIgFSVJ3
That's a whole other conversation. The educational system is a JOKE. Fortune 500 companies look at college degrees like a HS education. https://t.co/ETcauV0a0O
Bc stadiums &amp; facilities always need to be "upgraded" in order to attract more "student athletes" (if that is even a term). https://t.co/rjN9P2EaZj
I understand BUT these athletes are generating millions of dollars in revenue. https://t.co/eiChWjjYJD
Please stop comparing free clothes to 100 of millions? https://t.co/PaZH5ZhXZe
The @bigten nearly made 450 mil last yr. If only the confs had enough $ to pay athletes. I support your courage @NIGEL_HAYES #BrokeAthletes https://t.co/3KCqzPRNH9

This was suppose to be the yr @nyjets fans. Not worried about Ftizpatrick as much as I am worried abt this painful secondary.
Meanwhile I see #CowboysNation is LOUD &amp; PROUD about being 3-1 w/o @tonyromo . That @dallascowboys squad is only getting better.
. @Chiefs just getting blitz w/ idiotic mistakes. @steelers looking like last wknd vs the @Eagles never occurred. @MikeAndMike
This Reed / McIlroy matchup is so damn entertaining. We need more trash talking &amp; heckling in golf. #RyderCup2016

Time for the @ChicagoBears to move up up and away from Jay Cutler. #toofartuesday @MikeAndMike
. @MikeAndMike  W/ 2 weeks behind them, who would you draft first if you had your own @NFL franchise:
Adrian Peterson with a torn meniscus &amp; timetable is unknown. First Bridgewater &amp; now this. It's up to you Sam Bradford. #slowcap
@TaylorTwellman new phone killing me coach. #excuses
Love the swag of Kelvin Benjamin of the @Panthers saying they could've scored 60pts vs @49ers. 4 TOs &amp; no Jonathan Stewart #moxy
Lamarvelous Jackson is such a dual threat. He is always the fastest guy on the field every time I watch him play. FSU looks asleep.

It's a different game for Decker &amp; Marshall tonight against this secondary than Cincy. @nyjets bs @buffalobills @TwitterSports @MikeAndMike

Who said he even used it or bought it. All this hoopla over him just visiting. https://t.co/q4k5ZX6Szg
So #NFL doctors can prescribe Ibuprofen, vicodin, or OXY but just visiting a marijuana dispensary is "not good". There is a problem here.
It's 2016 &amp; it's not disturbing news that Ezekiel Elliot VISITED a marijuana dispensary.  It's time for this stigma to stop. @MikeAndMike
