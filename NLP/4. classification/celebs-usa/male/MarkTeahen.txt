Listen Brad, I’m out here trying things. I don’t know if a collar is in or out. I have foliage on my shirt, the white brings out my sunburn. Was this look “in” back in ‘84? The main issue is you misspelling my name when my name is in my Twitter handle. https://t.co/1GD9QyAIWb
@mixmastermatt4 @SorsoWineRoom
@Eric82573443 No. I’m super young with a hat on.
@clintonde I’ve fallen far. And I love building houses “theoretically”.
@justinmarkbro I love nature
@MCMTeahen @big_chiefD Yeah, I’m not about that visor life.
Any other guys putting bronzer on their forehead tonight because they wore a hat backwards at a #SpringTraining2019 game and sunburned their face? https://t.co/U2zEwpybqN
@halladayfan32 Nice! Enjoy the warm weather and baseball.
@halladayfan32 What’s up Matt.
My wife and her bountiful creativity has started a t-shirt line. Check out her growing business https://t.co/hlrImOCEzd *Models were paid with sugary snacks https://t.co/6AjU8kfAd4
@JohnGromowsky @Haudricourt @SSJWHB @journalsentinel Flawless idea.
@keithlaw Usually the “guilt trip the top free agent into signing with my team” routine is a fail proof approach.

@esim3400 Where was this speech for me in 2014? 5 years later you finally come with this knowledge!?!
@Joe_Hayles I’ll definitely try to get over there sometime this week. Maybe I’ll come Pitch so we can keep scoring to a minimum.
@DTrainMLB I’ve got 73, give or take a couple.
The traditional 8 year wedding anniversary gift is a well thought out tweet right? Happy Anniversary Lauren. I love you. https://t.co/zEx9xK9uVV

@dumbassrambling I’m a dream neighbor, just happens to be a disrespectful cactus in the neighborhood.
@halladayfan32 Hi Matt
Our neighbors wait for the holidays to let us know how they truly feel about us. #NaturesMiddleFinger #OnlyLightsInTheirYard https://t.co/OjAFVjl4dK
@chadthornsberry I hit an inside the park homerun off Joe Nathan to tie a game in the 9th back in 2008. I hit a flare to left field, Delmon Young dove for it, missed and didn’t hustle to get it.  Desi might have done it too but I don’t know his career as well as I know my own.
@chadthornsberry I guess that would depend on the bet.
@mickshaffer @bigpoppaherm You talking to me?
@nate_bukaty Truth
@KG_Cocidius @mellinger Why not?

@mellinger I do love the generation raising the younger generation complaining about the generation they helped develop.... I too look forward to future complaining though.
It’s 9:28am and I’m sitting outside @PartyCity waiting for it to open so I can make a return, so yeah retired life is as glamorous as @MLB life.

@RICHYBESSERMAN @ChrisRongey Yes. It kinda does.
@timkirch1960 Possibility
@RICHYBESSERMAN @ChrisRongey I say this into the mirror every morning.
@Swanee54 Attention to detail was never my strong suit.
@KSeaboldt @Swanee54 I like beer.
I prayed a lot during by my playing days. I didn’t win shit. #GodIsBusy
Great at bat #Muncey
Maybe because I can’t spell millions
I totally got screwed on the #MegaMillons

Well, except for the Joe West call in the first.
Good Stuff. All around. Fun baseball.

@Nick_aPlease Sure. Just send them to @SorsoWineRoom and I will sign then and get them back to you.
Best throw in postseason history
In Little League my Dad told me “real baseball players” tuck their bangs in their hat. Ryu finally vindicated 10 year old me.
@jeskincaid Here’s hoping is just twice today.
@jeff_rosen88 @timscott411
I figured the ‘06 @Royals would eventually turn up in this game.
@Bolts4Life4 https://t.co/2jZpU8H0xs
I’m over the “Batman and Robin” reference.
Fun watching players that earned playoff success with the @Royals use that experience to be productive in these big games.
@margiepargie201 Frame it to impress your friends or sell it to help pay for college.
@halladayfan32 Hi Matt
@wesbutler1017 If they host it, I’ll be there.
@agent_goon @BG831216 @Royals I don’t grope
@mellinger @Royals That was ‘06 and I polish my ‘06 RPOY trophy every morning.
@mellinger @Royals I’m still flabbergasted that my 7 homers and 55 rbis didn’t earn me poy, roy or any other oys. As you said though, I’ve developed an affinity for handling disappointment.
@nate_bukaty Game respects game.
Thanks to last night’s win I’d like to express a huge debt of gratitude to the 2018 @Royals for protecting the legacy of the 2005 @Royals. May our #106 live on in Kansas City folklore for eternity.
@lbp2 I’ll start training now.
@smdaly316 All the Superstars are there.
@dmann1471 Thanks Derek. One of the few who remember my @BlueJays stint.
@halladayfan32 Thank you Matt!
@mellinger Are either necessary, Question Mark
*your... I never screw up my your/you’re... clearly “never” is inaccurate.

@nate_bukaty Can you please go by “Sports Boy” moving forward?
@ry_fritz @AaronDonald97 @AdamSchefter @LRiddickESPN Me and my blue check mark believe they are trading him to the Cardinals.
@SMC_Baseball @PatrickWisdom5 Awesome! Well deserved! Congrats @PatrickWisdom5
@esim3400 Too late...
@RandomMLBPeeps I will assume “Random” in this case means rugged good looks and a swing that lacked launch angle?
Championship Game Tonight! Last chance to see the Louisville Stars in action as we play for the @BluegrassWS title. 6pm eastern. If you are not in Louisville you can watch the game live here: https://t.co/nFe3k2yUgz
@airundavis @johnbuck44 @DippinDots @BluegrassWS @Royals You’re not wrong.
Hit 2 more homers today @johnbuck44 and I’ll feed you my children’s @dippindots any day of the week. @BluegrassWS #Teammates @Royals https://t.co/pXwH8jro3a
@halladayfan32 Awesome. Happy early Birthday!
@halladayfan32 Just playing some ball with some former players. How are you?
Who’s coming to the @BluegrassWS in Louisville Tonight!?! Game starts at 7pm. We are hosting over 300 members of Gold Star Families and Hall of Famer @JohnnyBench_5 (our manager) will be honored. https://t.co/SaoOwK8Ynd
@ChipFinley This was my first and most likely last Sports Illustrated cover. It has been brought to my attention before, but I can still pay up on the beer and signed photo.
@DaveDarby46 @MarcusMelvin19 @rustindodd @Koreanfan_KC I’ll take it!
@MarcusMelvin19 @rustindodd @Koreanfan_KC Thanks!?!
Sorry if you’ve been trying to get ahold of me lately. I’ve been busy training for the @BluegrassWS . I’m playing for the Louisville Stars, a team of former MLB All-Stars, World Champions and me. https://t.co/yIA7iPuiHX
@tengle68 I picked that song for that game. I told Bieber before the game I was using his song. He asked which one... I honestly didn’t know he had more than one.
@ByBobDutton Thanks for having our back Bob!
@cogs1 @OMAStormChasers No, but that gentleman does share my striking good looks.
@tigestone @mickshaffer @rustindodd One day. One day. #Maybe
@BillPalcher @BluegrassWS You have yet to give me bad advise. I’ll look into mixing an ABBA song in.
@nate_bukaty @BluegrassWS This is a solid suggestion. A couple days ago I found the CD he gave me.
@baseballexis @BluegrassWS I might use this out of respect for @bigleagueswings
I need a walk up song for the @BluegrassWS next week in Louisville, KY. Suggestions?
Second half team @Royals
I better dust off my glove and bat. https://t.co/cckudFOBJ6
@mellinger This isn’t an original script.
@rogersherrer I’d be happy to. You can send it to Sorso Wine Room 15323 North Scottsdale Road Suite 150 Scottsdale, AZ 85254 Attn: Boss No need to send money or coupons I’ll get the ball back to you.
You had me at Golden Corral coupons! https://t.co/14wdVTTPyq
@DaveDarby46 @Markgubicza @MLBNetwork @Angels @Royals This is an easy YES.
Nothing like sitting down on the toilet to realize one of your sons still doesn’t lift the seat and has terrible aim.
@mellinger We are on vacation, can’t be wasting “gently used” diapers.
One day, probably sooner than later, Meyer is going to hate me for posting this. She is a beautiful young girl but she kinda looks like somebody’s drunk uncle in this picture. Gelato can have that affect on some. #Italy https://t.co/kAqu5gS4QX
My kids gave me the gift of behaving ok and being pretty much potty trained today. #Generous #MoreThanExpected #FathersDay #CalWasStillAShit
I should post a picture of my Dad today but we never take pictures together. He’s still a great dude. And I love my wife for making me a father. Our kids are pretty cool. By pretty I mean really.
@codybtapp @maxrieper @cupcakesarenice This can’t be me. I never received any negative fan interaction during my playing days. Every fan was 100% satisfied with my performance in every game I played.
@billpalcher1 Welcome!
@duffkc41 Tell me that letter is from Bill Palcher @mellinger
@esim3400 A couple claims are cause for questioning: 12 beers in 2 hours is an aggressive pace. Secondly, the sex. Once was a stretch, but twice in a day, with different willing females? Lastly, “smashing” hardly seems like your style. I assume you to be a thoughtful lover.
@N_Marker10 Awesome Noah! Well deserved. Congratulations on Graduating!
@DaveDarby46 You had 7 cups stacked in your previous post. You babysitting that 7th beer?
@halladayfan32 What’s up Matt. I hope you’re well!

@rustindodd I’ve seen it done. Some might say I even helped.
@goldbergkc Got to be careful with the “play everywhere” talk.
@DaveDarby46 Yes it does. Makes it exciting.
@FlatlandKC @Jeremy_Danner @Boulevard_Beer Any chance any of this will find it’s way to AZ?
@ChrisTill1985 *alright
@ChrisTill1985 They’re all right. Ha. Cool story and thank you for your service.
@ChrisTill1985 Basically like finding a mint condition Mantle rookie card.
@esim3400 Sounds like a flawless business plan.
@mellinger I beg to differ with your assessment of the level of difficulty.
@airundavis @David_DeJesus3 Dave always had more power than me. We we both gifted with raw explosive power.  I’ll pretend I don’t see the number of at bats column.
Going to see @jtimberlake tonight so have to post an old tweet of Mac searching for sunshine. https://t.co/x71oKJNAbf
@Raiderdash12 @ryan_landreth That autograph probably covers the price of the ticket......or not. Can confirm we lost at least 100 that year.
@KonerkosBonerko @Raiderdash12 @WatchTheBreaks @ryan_landreth It was a trade not a signing, but the other details of your tweet might be accurate.

@codybtapp His fault I started moving so better at least keep that prestigious stat.
@codybtapp It was a big day for me
@airundavis Most likely.
@pcroberts77 @jazayerli @Royals @BretSabes I’ll try. It’s not easy though.
@Sandbox_22 @bradfanningshow @Royals @BretSabes You have great taste.
@TJKuckelman44 @Royals @BretSabes I always had exemplary bat control. Thank your parents for asking me to hit you that.
@Royals @BretSabes Up to #3 on the Top 50 @Royals of all time and I’ve yet to see my name?I’ve got to assume it’s either me or Brett coming in at #1. I’m humbled and shocked to be ranked so high on this list. Congrats to the rest of the Top 50. Well deserved guys!
@mellinger @AdamHBeasley @funderpunt George Brett wants his “trying new things” theory back.
@timsteffens @pac12 That means a lot to me. Thank you.
@airundavis @MLB #Truth
Good Try @pac12
I love this time in Spring Training when every team in @MLB makes the “shocking” announcement that their best pitcher is the Opening Day starter.

Tough call but I think Mac wins this one. https://t.co/S18WPTFM3Y
@CespedesBBQ That day I used “Baby” as my at bat music. Prior to the game I told him I was using his song. He asked which one.... I didn’t realize he had more than 1 song, but thankfully remembered the title was “Baby”.
@DaveDarby46 @johnbuck44 I’m in
@royalcub89 @Royals That “jersey over the collared shirt” look always looks great.
@DaveDarby46 @Lnorman22 I blamed myself until Jaime and Buck carved everyone up too.
@DaveDarby46 @Lnorman22 I blame the coaching
@DaveDarby46 @johnbuck44 I’ll do what I can. He’s a good Instagram follow but I’ll tell him to step his tweet game up.
@KCRissler I’ve been waiting for that response. Ha. Surprised it took so long.
@carter1980 @Royals Tried that once.
@airundavis @royalsreview @Royals A couple @AperolUSA Spritz should do the trick.
@bradkporter ..... depending on what “it” is, I may indeed still have it.
@mchowardkc @Royals It was short lived but it was magnificent.
@TateCinKC @royalsclubhouse @Royals You just get me Tate.
@rdub04 @Royals It’s one of my top 9 positions
Thankfully I’m not considered “marquee” anymore. I’ll have my cell on @Royals https://t.co/udDiovu8Xw
@baseballdeworld Planning a trip over there but not to play. It was a great experience but my son starts school this year so I couldn’t do a full season.
@manbearwolf Team was stacked.
@JeffBerryMLB Congrats on modernizing to the social media world.
@SMC_Baseball @smcgaels @stmarysca Ok, fine, I’m coming!
Just got “Hair rejuvenation ointment” in my eye &amp; burning sensation makes me less sympathetic to the numerous remaining @mlb free-agents.
@ClayGarrison @MLB It definitely didn’t help Free Agents

@codybtapp @BrianMcGannon @DBLesky I loved Terry as a hitting coach. If he could make me a beast he can help plenty of the current @Royals He is also a great guy and the type of person you want associated with the team you cheer for.

@mellinger I cannot confirm the keyboard or the nachos but the bulk of this tweet I know to be accurate.
@MartyCarpino I concur. It's all a sad joke.

@rcarver777 I respectfully disagree.
@rcarver777 I don't like him using MLB's biggest stage to try to rectify his reputation. Classic Arod thinks he's bigger than the game.

As an ex-pro &amp; baseball analysis, I'd say the key to avoiding losing in the 2015 playoffs is scoring at least 1 run a game @Yankees @Pirates

@RAP77oh Let's be honest, @lululemon will never quit me, and vice versa.
@sethstone21 @MLB The entire country waits with bated breath for that answer.
As Spring Training officially starts, it will be the first time since 2003 no team will have me in camp. Good luck surviving @MLB

@BrandonRHillger No worries. I always enjoy a little tweet banter.
@BrandonRHillger discounting my opinion because of my lack of postseason experience leads me to believe you do have postseason experience?
@BrandonRHillger no

@LarryFitzgerald Thank You!!!! Hope you are a @AZCardinals for life but understand the business. Thank you for being such a pro.
Can't believe nobody else's practice squad could develop a guy to win a playoff game for the @AZCardinals Thanks a lot @Chargers #Lindley
Can Newton acting like he is great when he almost played his team into defeat against a team with 75 yards of offense. #standard
Since when is 75 yards of offense not enough to win an @nfl playoff game? @AZCardinals

@joeVoberle good update
@joeVoberle He's actually told me that's Achilles heel but the media and Royals never exposed it. Missed opportunities.
@big_jphil and you mine.
@joeVoberle Joe, would you like to be named Madison. Great pitcher and all but let's be honest, sucks he's named Madison.
At the end of the day his name is Madison the rest of his life. #WorldSeries2014

@caleb_lynch @jayhawkgene @derricklynch Even better.
@sethstone21 Glad @timscott411 &amp; I made our mark.
Seems to be a waste to use Gore with Hosmer on in front of him. Hope I'm proved wrong.

@giantsap Difference?
@phibear35 @VegasJoe680 Surely Bonds is not the first person ever to tell Morse to get his foot down. Great player does not = hitting coach.
@hankschulman The idea a guy hits a homer because a former Superstar told him something that day in BP is laughable.
@Cardschatter Heard Oct. 26th is a "Domestic Violence Awareness" game. Is this accurate &amp; will it be publicized? Can't find info anywhere
@Cardschatter October 26th. I was of by a month.
@Cardschatter Heard Nov. 26th is a "Domestic Violence Awareness" game. Is this accurate &amp; will it be publicized? Can't find info anywhere
@BOOMERMACU Retired this year. I'm just a fan these days.
@Wilnerness590 Just saw this, but I'd be happy to come on if another time works. Just DM me.
@Royal_Pride_9 Glad that jersey is helping make you friends. It had the same effect on me.
@wood_mitch I'll talk to my show's promotional team and try to make that happen.
@markmally22 Proud I made that list.
@BOOMERMACU Kansas City

Just how they drew it up.
@Detroit_Derek Thank you for supporting. I'll pass along your story to the family as I know they are looking for encouragement. Thank You.

@timscott411 Happy to be part of that 29 years of not losing playoff games.
@timscott411 tonight!
@RealBanny 5 more Oriole stolen bases and you nailed it.
Another scoreless outing by Zach Britton.
@EveryTweet_Ever I knew it
@jaysondemar Anytime I got out with guys in scoring position was to spite my manager.
Bunt 3 hole hitter with lefty on deck with lefty on the mound? Okay.... Let's do this!
@RealBanny Bunt your 3 hole hitter???
@hawkinscm12 Australians are mostly alienated British.
This British woman is just walking all over this island looking for an erection. #Viagra

@sfujita55 I appreciate your stance &amp; voice on recent events. Refreshing to see fellow athletes speak rationally on DV epidemic.
@Buster_ESPN Midwest bias
@foxsports910 @KennyAndCrash Respect caller's strength. Unfortunately average victim leaves &amp; returns 7-9 times prior to leaving permanently
Are you demanding more strict @nfl policy on Domestic Violence? Hold yourself, employer &amp; or employees to the same accountability on issue.
@KennyAndCrash NFL is microcosm of society. DV is a cultural issue. Goodell failed much like we as a society have to understand &amp; prevent DV
@VATMANP Many thank yous. The second part about Matt being a cool dude is debatable. Ha.
Don't let spotlight on @nfl blind you to fact Domestic Violence is national/ worldwide issue. Hope this conversation brings cultural change
@VATMANP @chrysalisaz @DODVaz http://t.co/ZW6MoOw8Qv Much appreciated. Closer game than I expected.
Completely appreciate &amp; respect Derek Jeter but I fear even Willie, Mickey &amp; the Duke are on the verge of an eye roll with this farewell.
@VATMANP Due to still being affiliated w/ baseball I'll refrain from betting. The "If" was important word in initial tweet. Friendly wager?
@VATMANP I don't trust any financial transactions going through Matt.
@keithlaw @moonraker717 #MVNP
@RAP77oh Definitely. Likewise if you make it out to AZ.
@RAP77oh I've always maintained you deserve at least 53% credit for my daunting stature.
@CespedesBBQ @Mariners @Angels Who is "They" and how do I get in touch with them?
@RAP77oh I got a decent strength coach and I really took to it. Actually those 2 times were all it took to get the "weightlifter" label.
@BaltimoreBlake_ There is only one Bud Norris
If I was a betting man I'd take the @Mariners with Felix on the mound beating a hungover @Angels Sept. call-up squad tonight. #Analysis
@JoeWalberg Happy I broke the top 10. I'm assuming I'm right behind Esteban German. #GoodCompany

I feel Miguel Olivo is getting a bad wrap. I played with him for a couple years and he didn't bite me once... Not even once.
@Brocstar1 if submerged in the pool, completely acceptable, if outside the pool that urine belongs in some shrubbery.
@RyanWitkowski That was a test... You're off the pool party invite list.
@SmashMastr it's not an act done openly, but if you've already concurred lakes and oceans, pools are a natural progression.
@timscott411 my friend chlorine.
@SmashMastr you must not swim much.
Strange how peeing in a pool is fine yet peeing yourself before jumping in a pool  would be considered weird.
@IrrelevantScott I'll set my DVR.
@IrrelevantScott Are you pitching a reality show?
@JoshRebholz Is that a B? Did you misspell million?
@timscott411 it's got to start somewhere.
@Buster_ESPN So my career average could potentially get better per these rule changes? #Retroactive
@cbunting2 I knew he meant well. Great fan. A found memory.
@mellinger Bill Palcher?
Without Moms there'd be a lot less people. #HappyMothersDay
Grateful my wife is such an amazing Mother. Our son is lucky to have her guiding him into becoming the perfect little gentleman.
Children are our future. Don't screw it up Moms. #HappyMothersDay
@RyanWitkowski My era made sure to keep the citizens on KC slender.
If I'm @JGil_4 I'm never letting @JManziel2 forget that he was the distant second 1st round pick for the @Browns in 2014 #NFLDraft
@josephpacey I fully endorse this statement.
@Schefffan1 Respectfully Disagree. 100% guys drafted in NFL play in NFL. Less than 1/2 drafted in baseball's 1st 7 rounds play 1 day in MLB
@amswaim 401K and 1 large beer.
#NFLDraft reminds me how disappointingly small my draft day entourage was. Also reminds me my signing bonus wasn't spent prior to receiving.
I prefer Mock Drafts to the actual #NFLDraft
@Josekarl17 Nowhere close.
@RealBanny #inningslimit
@RyanWitkowski The answer is "both".
People saying "Cinco de drinko"......Why? #Stop
I must believe @justinbieber exfoliates.

@jasonbenetti A young Mark Teahen?
My favorite part of the Pineda incident is watching other pitchers take to social media to explain how he could cheat more effectively.
@BuenoWaino We all do.
Earth Day is my favorite Planet day.
@brianmctaggart @Buster_ESPN Bo Porter: "The Sun is Hot!"
@SportsCenter @darrenrovell "Hustle and great hair."
One day years from now I'll tell my kids "I remember when Bryce Harper hustled". Good chance he'll will still be playing and playing well.
Holidays are a great reason to put on a collared shirt before drinking.

Happy Easter! http://t.co/83BDs1DKnp
@Mrs_McCarthy32 @chrysalisaz I assume that was directed at me, and yes I will be in attendance.
@ChrisCotillo Thoughts on the 1yr trade restriction on draftees? Seems pointless when they can just become PTBNL.
@Choobalka17 Lots of top prospects in that org. Will take a lot of pieces. Seems strange to have a day celebrating each promotion though.
The @astros #SpringerDay promotion seems misguided. Classic struggling organization selling a prospect as the one to turn everything around.
@IrrelevantScott No doubt in my mind. Perfect post introduction story.

@patronaut0709 Good Question.
I hope whenever I retire from baseball the shared sentiment is: "That guy was still playing?"
@SBranca8 Believe it. It's real, and it's amazing.

Baseball is my favorite sport. I like the small games within the game...and the moderate fame, small fortune &amp; babe of a wife it got me.

@TimRosaforte I'm sure Aaron doesn't mind sharing spot light w/ @69jarhead The reflexion off Rick's dome only makes spot light brighter
@TimRosaforte @69jarhead Look at you Rick. #BigTime
Being a great #Baseball player doesn't make your opinion valuable. Trust me, my opinion is priceless.
@KDFantasyBaller I feel PED users cheat fans &amp; shouldn't cheat them in their explanation too. I feel fans deserve honesty #JustMyThoughts
@KDFantasyBaller @EyeOnBaseball sorry for long answer. I appreciate the ? It needs to be fixed one way or another.
@KDFantasyBaller @EyeOnBaseball centered that they only ask the ?'s you posed &amp; don't ask how their honesty could benefit the game.
@KDFantasyBaller @EyeOnBaseball be forthright &amp; become part of the cure not the cause of the problem. Most that do use PED's are so self...
@KDFantasyBaller @EyeOnBaseball it's not about what the cheater gains by telling the truth. Once caught, if truly "sorry" players need to...
@KDFantasyBaller All your questions are what would the cheater gain by being honest. I'm saying fans &amp; players deserve an honest explanation
@Jwarthur2 cheat hide it from their teammates. Players at this point will do anything within reason to keep the game as clean as possible.
@Jwarthur2 MLB players made a stand by instituting the most thorough drug testing &amp; strongest punishment in any Pro league. The few who
@Lets_Go_Royals I've never seen anyone blush through twitter, but you may have just caused @ChenMusic to.
@OPRecruiter with suspensions and an ability to void contracts it would probably help prevent PED use across the board.
@OPRecruiter I'd hope owners would support not offering those players contracts but teams will pay whoever helps win.
@RTLong3 Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm truly not speaking on my situation but purely the integrity of the game.
@Lets_Go_Royals assuming you meant "The power OF handsome"- yeah, you're not the first to accuse me of that.
@RTLong3 sadly that may be the reality. PED users do affect guys vying for those roster spots.
@BHIndepMO unfortunately just as quickly as tests are improved &amp; process is polished -offenders find new ways around them #EverEvolving
@OPRecruiter Still would have to be something added to deter players approaching free agency. Majority supports whatever cleans up the game
@OPRecruiter Assuming you mean void contracts if found to be using PEDs? I think most would support a clause like that in all contracts.
@Patsoup78 a valid point.
@BHIndepMO MLB's doing everything possible to catch offenders.If guys were honest once they're caught it would benefit system.Help fix flaws
@DJMattMadcharo I've been creeping your tweets for weeks waiting for the perfect 1 to steal.
Vast majority @MLB players are clean &amp; want game to be PED free. I'm sick of cheaters acting like it was an accident or 1 time injury cure.
Still waiting for 1 player to be honest &amp; say,"I did steroids because I thought I'd hit more homers, help win more games &amp; get paid more $".
@RevsGroundsCrew I'm not saying but I'm just saying. Bad hands &amp; #RemoteDig bad combo.
@mellinger And it tasted glorious.
@RevsGroundsCrew #RemoteDig Quite possibly the worst idea/ promotion I've ever heard of. Good thinking @yorkrevolution #NobodyTellOfilio
@jonathancornea1 I'm doing well. Having a good summer. How are you doing? The Pawsox gonna win it again this year?
@GINGERbrreadman I actually didn't hear you. I sign before every game and after most. Sorry I missed you. My autograph is worth a lot.
@BIGreeddogg83 about time you follow me.
@CharlesBrewerAZ did you just tweet that while driving?
Along with 3 managerial challenges, @MLB expanded replay will also include 1 #Redo per player to be used on errors &amp;/or bad swings &amp; pitches
@Buster_ESPN What is the proposed color of the @MLB challenge flag?
6hr bus trip hoping we stop at a nice gas station reminds me of the days I complained b/c the charter flight had the wrong appetizers.
“@Mac__Tea: Getting in some last minute time w/ dad before he heads out. #roadtrip 😞 http://t.co/ZOgIICGMuf” Miss my boy &amp; his beautiful Mom
@navyguy5735 exactly
@timscott411 @navyguy5735 Long Winters.
@timscott411 More like, I'm socially awkward jeans b/c MTV tells me if I'm not "Sixteen &amp; pregnant" I need to embrace an alternative style.
Playing Baseball is like trying on skinny jeans, if you do it successfully you feel great &amp; want to show everyone if not you're pissed &amp; fat
“@nate_bukaty: #RatingsBonanza @MLBNetwork  “@KSeaboldt: It's @nate_bukaty on the telly! http://t.co/kY7VwsPlqf”” When did you get a suit?
Thanks @AaronBadds &amp; the Baddeley Family for being such huge supporters of @DODV2013 once again this year. #GolfWithBadds @chrysalisaz
@RAP77oh @Mac__Tea He is a bit immature in that area. Everywhere else he's developing just fine. #WeWillWorkOnIt
I like to introduce myself as "someone who needs no introduction..." Mainly because I'm socially awkward.
@jasonbenetti shocker
@mellinger and why do you know how that conversation sounds?
@BeeJayOhnson You think of everything.
@RealEstate85255 Yeah, I'm thankful for that too.
Bastardo is the most fitting name in this PED scandal.
@wtalley using what pull I still have for fan enjoyment.
@nate_bukaty Nobody ever does. #SadFace
I'm a "big fan" of Solitaire, but I too will cheat like hell to win that game.
Let's all finally say it "A-Rod is a victim"

@ChrisCotillo @Jen_Royle Isn't every team "presented the option" to sign any free agent? #IsThisNews
@WBBBStephenS guess everyone else will have chips. Hope you enjoyed the 3 burgers. #Rations
@RevsGroundsCrew are you turning on the lights or do we have to call the city.
Didn't see any #Expert call the Drew Butera deal. #Amateurs
My wife just brought breakfast sandwiches 4 team &amp; me. So quickly theme of the day is now #PlayBaseballSoAWonderfulWomanFindsYouAttractive
"Kids Day" today for 11am game. Breakfast provided for entire team is a dozen donuts. Reminding us the theme of the day is #StayInSchool
@mellinger  2010 was clearly the result of losing a team leader.
@RevsPBP Never thought I'd see a more awkward proposal than Everett's, but again @AtlanticLg surprises me. #Worst #BuddyHug #NoGirlOnField
@wtalley Not sure, everywhere I play a player catches the 1st pitch like they should. Not sure if or why that changed in KC.
Since when is the "FIRST Pitch" an open tryout? Need a pitch count on most "FIRST Pitch" ceremonies. #FirstIsSingular #1Pitch #PlayBall

@halladayfan32 doing well. Enjoying the summer. Hope all is good for you and your Jays finish strong.
Yeah...um...Sarah? Did you dress the mannequins? "Yes, I sure did! Why!?!" How do I say this.. ahh...you're fired. http://t.co/8QuUPErrKm
@KCJohn Hope your hand recovered.
@RAP77oh #Facts
@MyPinstripes Agree
I always enjoyed peeing for Dino Laurenzi Jr. Glad he got some vindication today. #WashUrHands&amp;ChooseACup #Up2TheLine #DoThese3NumbersMatch?
@GSmithKC No. Until +drug test/drug connection voids a contract this will continue. Melky Cabrera &amp; Bartolo Colon prove not steep enough too
As a player there's temptation to cheat to keep up, chase fame, success &amp;/or riches, but like all temptation in life there is right &amp; wrong.
"Shocked!"- Nobody
@cable_the_kid #TheyTradedMe I miss it too. #FunTimes
If my son doesn't have 5 tools by 5yrs old, he won't play Little League, I'll instead teach him to heckle b/c not enough start w/ that goal

@drudown1414 You're such a pitching coach.
I think Louisville Slugger @sluggernation should thank Mariano Rivera for what he's done for their business over his career #Cutter #NewBats
@photogwingsfan No. Almost once on a jam job roller down to third, but my speed let me down. So hard to square up. Always on the corners.
@pastorcope a few
“@Buster_ESPN: Salvador Perez is the first Royal to get an All-star hit since Bo Jackson.” @mellinger broke this story minutes ago #Scoop
Hopefully Salvador Perez knows what pitch to call. #42 #Cutter #NeedANewBat
@BSLillibridge good to see you're both wearing swim shirts.
@MattDavidson6 @tai_walker Congrats to both of you. Keep up the hard work &amp; success. What High School did you guys attend?
@jonathancornea1 York Revolution. Independent leaguer. Been a long year. Wish I was in Pawtucket. How are things?
@jonathancornea1 I'm in York PA
You know you &amp; your spouse have had enough wine when you start accusing each other of cheating a #Uno #Marriage
Holding down #1 spot on my #BucketList is….Don't die.
@GoSox05 No correlation. I think all women are beautiful. That was the point.
@PunkRockRevs Exactly!
Favoriting a tweet instead of retweeting is like taking an ugly girl w/great personality 2 lunch, really enjoying it but not telling Ur buds
@BKal11 @PatrickWisdom5 Care to elaborate on "Satisfied"?
@RevsPBP That was sent a day late. Was meant for the girl that tackled the warning track in Bridgeport but continued on for victory.
If my team plays the rest of the year with the same passion the girl brought to the dizzy bat race tonight we'll be getting sized for rings.
@JoshRebholz don't watch, but just trying to keep up with the Top Twitter Topics.
Did I miss something? Did @DwightHoward make the @Lakers better? I appreciate his talent, but he didn't work in LA.
@NoseFaceKillah7 That is a fact.
"Excuse me, RU hotel guest?"- No, we snuck into #HolidayInn Bridgeport, CT w/friends to have our son sit in a box &amp; celebrate his 1st Bday.
@MattDavidson6 You're welcome
For 1yr now @Mac__Tea has brought happiness, laughter &amp; love 2 our fam. So Thankful 4my amazing wife being the Best Mom 2 our little 1yr old
Happy #CanadaDay and Happy Birthday to my favorite Canadian (sorry, not @pgeary27) My Dad.
@Buster_ESPN To confirm, Whitey Ford played his career sans PED's, right?
@williebloom Gonna need Gun Rosetta Stone to understand your tweets today.

@jonathancornea1 I know, I gathered that from your tweets. Tough loss, good year though.
@jonathancornea1 Who were you cheering for?
@elijahrivera6 Nope. Got stolen apparently. We made the most of it.
@StevenSouzaJR Doing well, been a crazy year, but life is great. Happy 2 see you keep putting homers on the board. @BSLillibridge Tweet&gt;Text

@StevenSouzaJR think I just saw U homer on highlights of tonite's gm. Congrats. As far as video gms, they may give me more cred than I'm due
@RAP77oh @EGArnesen I believe the term is #AtlanticLeaguedHim @Mac__Tea &amp; I enjoyed seeing Arny at the York YMCA, but they Big Leagued him.
@drudown1414 either Heaven or York, PA. Thin line. Baseball loves me.

Great 1st Father's Day as a Father. Thankful my Dad taught me what a great Father is &amp; I'm loving trying to duplicate his success.
@jfmandel I feel you.
"Saturday is a dead tweet day" - People slightly too dependent on Twitter
@ShannonGlasford Good. Me neither. Just checking.
Anyone else save tweets in their "Drafts" til they're drunk enough to send them?
Terrible. Must be a better option “@chrysalisaz: Teacher Fired After Being Domestically Abused via @HuffingtonPost http://t.co/103APNFUac”
Love (Hate) that the only @MLB highlight on @SportsCenter is the brawl. It's a good league with ultra talented players, feel free to show it
@IanDesmond20 @StevenSouzaJR Cool. Good for him. Always nice when baseball creates cool stories
@AaronBadds hope the inside doesn't look similar.

Tip of the day: if you tuck your shirt into your pants, wear a belt. In related news, socks w/ sandals is a bad call too #HighFashion
Always a coin flip when you need a hair cut in a random town &amp; @GreatClips is only option. Thankfully this time they lived up to the name.

@FyockUww Completely Agree but guy w/ intent 2 augment strength &amp; performance, penalty should b more severe than some1 like Galvis situation
I hope all the kids watching the #WBC tonight learned something... Winners cock their hat to the side.
@MarcNYY618 Not talking about lessening penalty. Baseball has strictest n pro sport. Before making more severe need to clarify intent issues
@MattDavidson6 well crap. I'll see if they can add a table to our couples massage. Zipps always cheers me up. #MarkyLikeWingy

Brett Favre has announced he will unretire and petition for the Super Bowl XIV MVP. Ed Werder&  Jenn Sterner have voted their approval.
Aussies never lie. PACKERS in a close one. Why'd we waste our time watching? #soothsayer
Thank you Christina Aguilera for holding that last note past 1 min 50 sec. #EasyMoney
My friend in Australia just told me the Packers won in a close one. I hate it when people in an earlier time zone ruin my #SuperBowlSunday
@cst_Cowley you don't know the half of it. Enjoy the game.

@Joeynach thanks.
Thanks for the help. No offense to US Cellular but I don't hear about them anywhere outside of Chicago. No cool slogan #CanYouHearMeKnow?
Is Verizon service good in Chicago? Sprint? I know At@t is bad? Any other good cell service in Chicago?
@jensweiden Gaels Gone Wild indeed. Good to see you via twitter. I hope I can have the same profile pic someday. #GaelReunion

Thanks for feedback. Verizon- Droid sounds best. Surprised how bad AT&T service is. Goodbye #IPhone #AT&T #NotTheAllOverNetwork
I hear #Verizon #IPhone is different than #AT&T #IPhone Anyone know how it differs? Still a great toy and terrible phone? #fingerscrossed
I think @cowboyjoeclub begs 2 differ & if there is 1 Joe u don't want 2 tick off it's Cowboy Joe “@hanklayton: Wyoming probably isn't real.”
Got our #GaelsGoneWild T's. Ready for tonight! RT@MickeyMcConnell: Game tonight vs. Gonzaga at 8 on ESPN 2!! #itsallabouttheg #GaelsGoneWild
