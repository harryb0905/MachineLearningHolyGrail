You had to expect Kansas to win this. If they pull it off, K State has to win its remaining three games: Baylor home, TCU away, Oklahoma home. Will they choke it away?
@KGertsen @TheAthleticCBB thanks KG!
@BoneyJabronie @DukeAlumni never lived on East!
Tell your friend under my rule UConn would have been ineligible had it lost to DePaul. Instead the Huskies beat DePaul and won the next four games, got into the tourney and won the title. Next question. https://t.co/E1oA5sOqjZ
I've never liked the hard and fast rule where a coach sits a player for the rest of the half when he has two fouls. K State needs Dean Wade out there, and as a senior he should know how to play without committing his third.
Good to see Grimes letting it fly
You’re saying they get to play a highly ranked team in early March on a neutral court? That’s a golden opportunity that Vermont would love to have. https://t.co/G8wU4st5tq
If Loyola had lost in the Missouri Valley tournament it’s possible the Ramblers would not have gotten at large bid. Three weeks later Sister Jean was the most famous nun in America. Imagine what we might have lost.
This is not a feel good argument. Having more mid majors as opposed to sub .500 power conference teams is good for business. That’s why people who don’t care much for college hoops watch the NCAA tournament. There’s nothing like it.
My idea for a rule requiring .500 conference records includes the tournaments. If you don’t have a bye you are playing a team below you in the standings. If you can’t get to .500 at that point then you shouldn’t get a bid.
There have been a few changes in college hoops the last 30 years. Conference expansion concentrated power in the power conferences. And midmajors drastically closed the gap. Who’s to say who are the “best” teams when deciding the last few at large spots?
I have the utmost respect for @tsnmike so I recommend his riposte to what I wrote in Hoop Thoughts. Of course his augment might be stronger if he didn’t rely on examples from 30 years ago. https://t.co/3bo2qdgRCz
New rule: You must have at least a .500 record in your own conference (including conference tournaments) to be eligible for an NCAA at-large bid. I explain in Hoop Thoughts for @TheAthleticCBB. https://t.co/0KQix4nwTr

I'll be very curious to hear Coach K explain why they burned Joey Baker's redshirt. My guess is it was done to address their horrid three-point shooting more than an indication Zion will be out for longer than we thought.

Wofford up 49-44 at Furman with 13:25 to play. Game of the day!

Florida State has repeatedly gotten clean looks at three pointers. Seminoles not a great three point shooting team but these guys are wide open. If they start falling, look out.
Oklahoma State is on pace to score 24 points
Who was it that said UNC would not be emotionally prepared today? Sheesh

@espnVshow @fatmantrav79 well said!
Auburn has three points in the first eight minutes of the second half. Carry on.
Lotta people complaining about all the replay reviews. Last week people were complaining that offensive goaltending was not reviewable. It's almost like no matter what happens people complain about it.
@A_Mar32 @JonRothstein Washington currently 29th in the NET so yes it is, barely
Kentucky now up 25 with Reid Travis on the bench. If Auburn loses the Tigers will drop to 1-7 against Q1 teams, with the one win coming at home against Washington. Why are they not on the bubble @JonRothstein?
Looked like Will Wade blew off the handshake line totally?
Also looked like Will Wade and Grant Williams were chirping on the handshake line? Quite a game down in Baton Rouge.
What was Barnes mad about?
The monitor reviews are killing the end of the Tennessee-LSU game. When I am czar of college basketball THERE WILL BE NO REPLAY REVIEWS OF ANY KIND!!! I got s*** to do.
LSU and Tennessee now tied at 71 with 30 secs to play in Baton Rouge. LSU ball.
Do you need a hug? https://t.co/3JOqMdLuFG
too soon https://t.co/xRxNjDxgGb
LSU trails Tennessee by 2 at home without its best player. Says a lot about the Tigers ... and perhaps the Vols.
Louisville's three point barrage in the first half ended up being fools' gold. Virginia ended up winning at KFC Yum! by 12.

Romeo Langford is a terrible three point shooter. So a step back three from Romeo Langford is probably not the best way to get Capone. To OT we go. Indiana’s season in a nutshell.
Bohannon!
@sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein I voted for Feinstein’s opponent but the only one being disrespected here was her. The idea that she doesn’t understand  climate change is ludicrous

@joshuap98791171 @EvanSchlough But my question is why should any industry be guaranteed a profit? Isn’t this the very definition of socialism? Yet a lot of farmers are going to vote for Trump because they think Dems are socialist.
Yeah but what does he know https://t.co/uBBBN0NOvP
@WCPF_FarmerJoel @EvanSchlough so why vote for someone who makes it far worse by starting a totally unnecessary trade and tariff war?
@WCPF_FarmerJoel I believe our immigration and border policy foolishly keeps people IN the country who don't want to live here full time. If we greatly expand partial work visas they could move across the border back and forth more easily and openly. You in?
@joshuap98791171 @EvanSchlough I'm just wondering why so many in rural communities say they are against gov't spending and illegal immigration and therefore vote Republican. I don't want them to go broke but don't see the consistency.
I see the ACC is ranked fifth in the NET conference rankings. That's behind the Big East. What gives?
@nesralirac Agreed!

As exhausting and aggravating as the whole Zion discussion has been today, I do think it has been a worthwhile examination of the value of playing college sports and the challenges therein. And I think we're all glad that he wasn't seriously hurt.

Tons of comments on this story already. I like it when people attack me personally because it means they can't win the argument on the merits. @TheAthleticCBB  Here's why people who say Zion should shut it down are wrong:  https://t.co/nu730W8WeB
Lots of people are making the argument that Zion should shut it down.  I just took that argument and ... shut it down. Now at @TheAthleticCBB   https://t.co/nu730W8WeB
Look at the move he made that got him hurt last night. He would do that 100 times in an hourlong workout. And he wouldn't be in nearly as good physical condition, nor would it prepare him remotely as well as playing in big games under bright lights. https://t.co/3EQa4e88w8
Same people arguing for Zion to shut it down are the ones saying we are THISCLOSE to players boycotting the Final Four. You know why that won’t happen? Because players want to play in the Final Four.
So if Zion shut it down for the season how would he spend the next four months? Would he sit in a couch or would he train his ass off? He could easily blow out a knee doing that. So now what? Put him in a plastic bubble? I’m all ears!
There are at least a dozen players in college right now who are guaranteed to be first round picks. Not all are freshmen. Can someone send me a list of which ones should shut it down now and which should continue playing? Thanks!

Killer sequence at the end of the half for Duke. Gonna be an interesting locker room to say the least.
Teams are a combined 2 for 30 from three. Good times.
Villanova loses at Georgetown tonight. Third loss in its last four games.
Carolina generously missing a zillion three pointers. Duke getting its legs back. Buckle up.
Notice how @JayBilas never used the word "intentional." That's an irrelevant word, and Jay knows the rule.
Not a flagrant
Obama gonna go back in that locker room and be all Mr. Miagi rub his hands together and heal Zion's knee and then it's ON
So the real question is how long Zion will be out. Hard to speculate but the fact that he walked off under his own power has to be a hopeful sign.
Sucks https://t.co/n8WB7GJ80E
You're not Zion https://t.co/51vgl0sXNP
After that three-point barrage at Virginia Duke went 10 of 44 from three in its next two games. It is a horrible three-point shooting game. That can be overcome but not by ... shooting a ton of threes.
Duke looks awful on both ends of the floor. They've lost their Superman and they know it.
These threes are not the way to go for Duke.

Meanwhile Florida about to pick up a huge win at LSU. Will really bolster the Gators' tourney prospects.

gonna have to win the AAC tourney https://t.co/QzcUT2Mq4q
Michigan lost at Penn State and I only dropped them one spot. They should build a statue of me right outside Zingerman's. https://t.co/DcrmBjtxyO

oh SNAP! I am very impressed. Just for that you get an extra cookie! https://t.co/Qa4kBX0NRK
Very good team but they have not played a single Quad 1 game all year. Hard to move em up any higher. https://t.co/dNtYBWi4cu
actually, no. I had UK ahead of Tenn on my 1 line today. Much better wins, plus the head to head https://t.co/2yGEV799kY
I just think they're that good https://t.co/RaFzwhcwap

They beat TCU in OT and West Virginia. Those are two high powered opponents ... not https://t.co/f9XIswY8l1
when that happens I'll rank accordingly. Now can you please brush your teeth? https://t.co/QIgGibPnXz
not a matter of penalizing but they have to evaluate teams based on who they will be in the tourney https://t.co/AUWVuMRyc4
did your mom write that for you? https://t.co/uuGwPWcbWR
Don't overthink it. Probably should have ranked LSU last week. Michigan had a good bounceback win and has only lost three games all year. https://t.co/THABEzkiPu
they're good but very few quality wins. They're No. 18 on KenPom https://t.co/SRPna9EupO
This is not an overall resume deal. They just had a stretch where they lost four out of six and then lost two starters. If anything I might be overly generous. https://t.co/3POZSpyies

Alright my pretties you may come out from under your bridges. It's Sunday night, which means it's time for me to feed the trolls. Here is my weekly AP top 25 ballot....
Troll feeding will go down for real in five minutes. Be ready to feast on my brilliance.
Season defining win for St. John's. They also have two wins over Marquette and a neutral court win over VCU. Gonna be very hard to keep them out of the field.
Troll feeding will go down for real around 7:30 pm ET. I will give you a 15 minute warning. So plan accordingly you hairy smelly unshowered pathetic little bridge dwellers.
Michigan State ends on a 20-2 run with Nick Ward on the bench. Impressive.
fair point. Can I get a mulligan? https://t.co/Os0AD1s02W
Not necessarily. There's a difference between a seed list and a poll ballot https://t.co/ukxIx9oIlC
It's close but both of Gonzaga's losses were to NET top 10 teams. Michigan lost to 15, 28 and 70 https://t.co/3KHpO9u1Ox
Last thing Michigan State needs is for Nick Ward to have a serious hand injury. Spartans trail Ohio state at home by two with 12:30 to play.
This is how my 1 and 2 line looks right now. I see a lot of people still have Kentucky as a 2. They are all wrong. https://t.co/X2Bw9n4v7M
Michigan State is on pace to score 16 points
Might be just anecdotal but I feel like this has happened more this season. I know people smarter than me have run numbers that were basically inconclusive? https://t.co/5KO7WbFDNK
@stelladotleslie @autismspeaks @wallyball @AdamZuckerCBS honored to do my small part Leslie! Tom and Pat did the heavy lifting. God bless you and your family.

Mississippi State up 9 at Arkansas 13:27 to play
Washington pulls off the 72-70 win. Wasn't pretty but it counts.
On a key late possession Washington switches to man to man. Results in an airball and closing out the game on the road. Impressive.
so you're saying there's a chance.... https://t.co/r9fGYr0qCm
Louisville believes there's no way Kentucky can blow this lead.
@Bmore_Al thanks!
Meanwhile Washington and Washington State are putting on a great show in Pullman. Huskies have been trailing most of the game but now lead by 3. No one will want to play these guys in the tourney.
you know what? I thought LSU's win at Georgia today was more impressive. Tigers were coming off the high of the UK win and were on the ropes on the road in conference. Yet found a way to win. https://t.co/CLiJp30zLL

That was Tennessee's first free throw. Grant Williams had a game where he shot 23 of em.
So my ballot looking like...  1. Duke 2. Kentucky  Just in time for March
I love that Kentucky's identity is built around its defense. They really look like the older team tonight.
Tennessee can take a punch

Kentucky owning the defensive backboards right now. Tennessee has to find a way to get extra opportunities.

@BeschlossDC I have thought about this often. Can you imagine the despair.
My sons now telling me Fortnite is almost done. Is that true? Apparently Apex Legends is now a thing. I cannot keep up.
Palmer makes em both and Nebraska gets the win. Snaps a 7 game losing streak. If Pitino is mad now wait til he sees the replay.
Bad call at the end of the Minnesota-Nebraska game. Palmer jumped into the defender. All tied up 1.1 secs left on BTN
Mike is right when he says refs should be criticized like everyone else. Anyone saying there is no accountability for refs is completely misinformed. They are scrutinized and graded very closely and get work/assignments accordingly. https://t.co/nwZCZnZzWu

@dailyzen is it bad to fall asleep?
@murphymike why are you not more concerned that we are so far behind our competitors on high speed rail?
Scenes from Duke's unbelievable 23-point comeback against Louisville  https://t.co/05HMEJ0gtI
Same thing when he instructed Brian Zoubek to intentionally miss a foul shot in the closing seconds of the 2010 final. Lots of coaches would think about doing that. Very few would follow through in that situation. It almost backfired epically.
Remember this is the same guy who put a freshman guard who hadn't played all year into the second half of the NCAA championship game. In those moments Coach K is able to summon his instincts and trust them completely. That is very hard to do.
There was no logical reason for Coach K to go to zone in the second half. He was desperate to change the game up and protect Zion from getting his fifth, though Zion playing center wouldn't do that. K doesn't think outside the box bc he doesn't see boxes.
Also (as I re-watch the second half on my laptop) give huge credit to @CoachJimmyDykes because even when Duke was down 20 he kept saying "it's over but it's not over." He is one of the great broadcasters in our biz.
They were also down 19 with 6:32 to play.
I'm saying that the loss to UNC was almost two-and-a-half months ago, and maybe things have changed a little since then, as indicated by a loss to a team with a 1-11 conference record. https://t.co/0gCK0Wv9LA
Not sure this is quite breaking through. Duke didn't just come back from 23 down to win last night. They were down 23 with 9:04 to play. And Zion had four fouls at that point. That shouldn't be mathematically possible.
@GaryParrishCBS @CBSSportsNet @A_salmo @BrentStoverCBS @bwood_33 @JonRothstein So jealous you got a real producer
I look forward to reading the oral history of that Duke comeback cc: @jeffgreer_ @clbrownhoops @KellenbergerCBB @TheAthleticCBB
If you don't watch college basketball until March because you think the regular season doesn't matter then you don't deserve to be happy.

Takes two to tango https://t.co/WZwmyh2Ajt
Biggest second half comeback of Coach K's career. And he's been coaching since before the invention of fire.
Duke. Sharpie.
They can NOT review whether a player was in legal guarding position.
Btw the rule is also if a player's heels are ABOVE the arc but not touching it counts as inside the arc. In this case McMahon's feet were down.
That's a new rule. Reviewable this year for first time.
He was clearly in the arc. As usual Duke getting hosed by the refs.
honestly not sure https://t.co/6ytBQDUddY
Beware the Zion offensive rebound here
Duke-Louisville is drunk
Okay my Michigan trolls. You've been crushing me for two weeks. Feel free to @ me with your mea culpas. I'll still love you!
Great point. I mean who else do they even have? https://t.co/dOTM8AdWCe
Five bucks says in the postgame Coach K will say at some point “we were not deserving of winning.”
Good reminder these are college kids; not robots. Duke is totally out of it and Louisville was laying in wait.
Duke now facing its biggest deficit of the season. Down 12 early second half at Louisville on ESPN.
Louisville is catching Duke at a great time. Blue Devils looking flat and out of sync. See if the Cards can keep this up.
Wow https://t.co/J0C8qY2nia
It is actually a miniscule percentage which is why when I'm the czar I will outlaw all replays https://t.co/5Drv64uyEs
I've always thought the goaltend call was the second toughest in hoops to make next to the block/charge. Refs never have a perfect angle like the camera above the rim and things happen real fast. UK had plenty of chances to win.
There is literally no disputing that that was basket interference. Very difficult call to make especially in that situation and not reviewable.
Good point https://t.co/SJg9eTZBTd
The rule in college hoops is that if the ball is above the rim in the cylinder it is offensive intereference. That play is NOT reviewable but the basket should not have counted
That ball was CLEARLY in the cylinder. That part of it is not reviewable.
LSU. Sharpie.
I thought it beat the buzzer but it was in the cylinder.
Tom Izzo. No tie!
@nalyticsatwork @JoelOsteen @johnpavlovitz love him!
I thought Washington fouled Reid on that offensive rebound. Reid had position.
Big buckets by Goins and Ward and Spartans close out the win in Madison. Mad props.
All tied up with one minute to go in Rupp. Is this great or what?
I spy Hack a Happ
Waters is a great example of why I think people go too crazy with all the ball screens. When you set that screen you bring over a second defender. Better off not crowding his space.
evergreen tweet https://t.co/81w5T9UuF2
Tremont Waters is a pro
LSU takes a two-point lead just under 8 mins to play. Great game in Rupp.
Rough night for the Mark Turgeon can't coach crowd
did you just call me a putz? https://t.co/4zF0MtOzTg
I believe Happ was technically outside the paint on that last jump hook. Badgers and Spartans now tied in Madison.
Jalen Smith now has 12 pts in the second half.
I've got Purdue-Md no the TV, UK-LSU on the laptop and Mich St-Wisc on the iPad mini. All I need is It's A Wonderful Life playing on my phone and I'd be in heaven.
Now Haarms picks up his forth. Ditto for Naz Reid of LSU.
Please stop showing coaches in a box during live game action. They are not that interesting.
Bruno Fernando hates rims!
Trevion Williams in foul trouble has really hurt Purdue. Game moving a little too fast for him.
These Maryland freshmen are all growns up
Don't....have....enough.....screens....(panics)

Alright my pretties you may come out from under your bridges. Get ready for the best moment of the week on Twitter. Time to feed the trolls! Come feast on my weekly top 25 for the AP poll....
Five minutes til I feed the trolls. I am guessing there's gonna be some fireworks....
@JonRothstein why do you hate my team?
I don't usually tease ahead, but in my Hoop Thoughts column for @TheAthleticCBB tomorrow I will publish the first installment of my annual Enemy Lines columns. That's where I ask coaches to give anonymous opinions teams inside their leagues. Hot stuff.
@jbach2121 fair enough Sir
I'll be feeding the trolls at 9 pm ET. So plan accordingly you pathetic unshowered foul-breathed bridge dwellers.
Highly impressive win for Houston. Could the Cougars end up on the 2 line?
In actual life you are called upon to do things you might not prefer to do in the moment but you do anyway because there is a greater to be done. Like showing respect for your opponent and the game at large. https://t.co/WGS1fFbTLA
Love seeing the energy at Houston for this game against Cincinnati. Cougars lead by 6 with under 16 minutes to play. What a job Kelvin Sampson has done there.
Indiana's execution over the last minute left much to be desired. Hence, the home loss. Nice job by the Buckeyes.
Great offensive set leads to Andre Wesson dunk. Then Langford takes a three ... which is exactly what Ohio State wants. Buckeyes ball up 2 with 8 seconds to play.
Why post Langford on Kaleb Wesson? And why try to enter it to the post from there? Smh. Buckeyes ball, tie game, 32 secs to play on CBS.
C.J. Jackson answers! We're tied. One minute to play.
Big shot by Devonte Green!!! Hoosiers finally take the lead by three points with 1:30 to play. Get to CBS!
from @GottliebShow burner account https://t.co/neXcCyP9M3
My main reasoning for predicting the Pac 12 getting will get at large is the stark reality that it is very difficult to fill out a 68-team bracket. Howie knows this as well as anyone. Plus Washington could lose the conference tourney. https://t.co/zqpTvvSTUO
Want to be sure I am on record with this prediction loud and clear: The Pac 12 will get at least 2 teams into the NCAA tournament. ASU's home win over Washington was an important result for the league.
If Cam Reddish and his teammates are going to shoot threes like that, then the rest of the college hoops world should be very afraid. @DanaONeilWriter has the scoop from Charlottesville for @TheAthleticCBB https://t.co/Nx6oHz2yTb
@NanneyScott Did you learn such grace at the church you manage? Not sure how you twist that into a personal shot. Especially since I’ve been voting Tennessee number 1.

Thanks to everyone who joined my live Q&amp;A at @TheAthleticCBB. I promise I will get to all the remaining unanswered questions. We LOVE our subscribers!! Here's the recap: https://t.co/AWwzmCpFKE
Howard should never have left Booth. Miscommunication with Anim. Excellent help by Morrow. Booth should have pulled up for the midrange. Drove it right into jail. Great game. https://t.co/v7pT4BvGXz
Terrific final defensive possession for Marquette. Forced Booth to drive into help and he had nowhere to go. Result was Samuels taking a tough contested shot. Great win for Marquette, terrific couple of hours for college basketball.
Craziness!! Marquette turnover and now Nova is down 1 with the ball and 12.8 secs to play.
Marquette-Nova is everything we hoped it would be. Golden Eagles up by 1 with a little over a minute to play.
Great response by Marquette. Anim and Howard score, now up 5. Nova time out.

Definitely NOT a flagrant foul on Travis on Peters but boy that looked like it smarts!
@bmd23red I visited with Jud every time I went to Spokane and traveled there to interview him for my book. One of the great characters of all time.
Great seeing Magic Johnson and the rest of the 1979 champs being honored at halftime at Michigan State. Jud Heathcote has the best seat in the house.
Mississippi State has found its spark here in the second half. Kentucky's lead down to 3 with 9:18 to play. How a 17-2 run. Good one on CBS.
Cam Wisconsin get in through the back door?
Halftime coming up on CBS. UK has been dominating Miss State. Talk to ya in a couple minutes!
Luke Maye hits a big three and now UNC and Miami are headed to OT in Chapel Hill. Michigan up 3 on Wisconsin with 3 mins to play. Butler up 2 at Georgetown 3 mins to play.
Miss State's pick and roll D leaves something to be desired

@DanReichert23 @murphymike Will make the area unaffordable. Could those tax breaks go to local schools and communities? More small business loans? What is the ROI on this?
@murphymike Truly respect your opinion Mike. You weaken your arguments with meaningless words like “conservative” and “far left.” Make your case on economics and my mind is open. Smart people arguing both sides here and I am genuinely interested.
Truth https://t.co/YwRtdZHd3x
@sethkimmel @tuckerjef @murphymike @tdale004 this isn't politics. This is economics. Is it a good thing from NYC and that neighborhood in particular for Amazon to open an HQ there? Seems to me there's a strong case against.
@murphymike Why? Amazon got enormous tax breaks and it’s presence will seriously hurt the people who live there.

Syracuse always over-performs in the NCAA tournament because teams are so unfamiliar with that zone. The same thing will happen with Washington, which is coached by longtime SU asst Mike Hopkins. The Huskies can score it, too. Great win at Zona tonight.

Evergreen tweet https://t.co/QTwlCbkVFh
Indiana won't go away. Langford breakaway cuts Iowa's lead to 58-52 with 9:30 to play.
Thybuille picks up his fourth foul for Washington with 10:13 to play. Huskies up 4 at Arizona.
Chase Jeter picks up his fourth foul with 17:38 still to play. Arizona now down six and getting wobbly.
Washington State now up 20 at Arizona State with 6 minutes to play. ERNIE ******* KENT!!!!!
Tight, exciting game going on at McKale. Can Arizona hand Washington its first Pac 12 loss? Cats up 1 late first half.

I think coaches should have the option of opting out of the halftime interview. Most of them are fine with it and are happy to do it. It’s often not a pleasant exercise for the reporter or the coach.

It’s official: NCAA announces Silvio De Sousa must sit out this season and next.
To repeat: The NCAA has made its decision regarding Silvio De Sousa’s reinstatement appeal. An official announcement is forthcoming. I expect the news will not be good for De Sousa and Kansas.
From what I am hearing an announcement from the NCAA Silvio De Sous is imminent. It sounds like the news will not be good for De Sousa and Kansas but we should know for sure very soon. @TheAthleticCBB
@chrisf414 Stay tuned

In all my years coming to Lawrence I have never visited the gravesite of the man who invented this great game. Thank you Doc Naismith! https://t.co/SiRI0nFtxT
Glad I missed being on this list. But where’s Rush Limbaugh? https://t.co/8WrdStQa4D
I always cite Peppers as the prime example of a football player who actually looked like a basketball player when he stepped on the court. Great hands and smooth offensive game. https://t.co/w7jUNK6Vxh

Cheatham is a beast on the glass. I spy a glue guy.
Free basketball in Tempe.
When I am college basketball czar (matter of time) there will only be one time out per team per half.
This is why I don't like when coaches call time out before a big possession. More often than not it results in a terrible shot. You work on these situations in practice, let the kids play.
@coachsvenson Thanks Ryan! That is what it's all about.
Zylan Cheatham hates rims
I see you Ryan Luther!
@princesstepha he doesn't always think so but maybe this week. Thanks!
First of all you could go broke betting on what the NCAA is going to do. Second, it's not like he's a major savior. It would take him a long time to get up to speed. He practices w the scout team mostly. https://t.co/XqO8fVJ983
When CBS assigned me to do sideline reporting on Texas Tech-Kansas, I told my 14 year old son, who is a huge college hoops fan (surprise), "You have to see Allen Fieldhouse." So we're on our way. Love being a dad!

Being a Redskins fan is so depressing.  Knicks fan: Hold my beer.
I made an educated guess that he would be back for Texas Tech. Still not out of the question but definitely thought we'd know either way by now. The fact that is taking this long is not a good sign for Kansas. https://t.co/pYqh93batc
@benmckee14 would never do that. That's why I isolated it on the Tweeter. Twitter mentions are not reflective of the population at large -- at least I hope so!
Really is amazing I still get these. Says much more about the tweeter than the coaches. https://t.co/grlsLDDptC

Seventeen months since the dramatic press conference by SDNY the only head coach to be fired remains Rick Pitino. Not sure that measures up to the pronouncements made that day. They caught a bunch of sketchy fringe players who were mostly scamming each other.
Another plea that does not provide incriminating info against others (eg head coaches) who were not among the 10 originally arrested. https://t.co/0UxgzIX51C

@scoop1985 crazy game!
This is an unreal comeback. I thought the Spartans were dead.
Winston three. Down to eight. Wow!
Tillman giving the Spartans some great minutes right now. Three point play cuts the lead to 9 with 8:30 to play on CBS.
Winston to Tillman and the lead is down to 12. Don't touch that dial.
Michigan State is off the mat. Down 14 with 10 mins to play. Not easy, but doable.
Purdue now up 23. This is officially a whuppin. At this point it's not even worth Michigan State trying to come back. Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug.
You've got to think at some point Michigan State makes a run and cuts this thing to single digits. The question is whether the mountain is too steep, and how Purdue responds.

St. John's, which needs a good win badly, trails Georgetown at home by 10 with under 9 mins to play.
I said last night on @CBSSportsNet that Purdue would win this game. We'll see if it holds up. The main thing is Boilermakers have bodies inside who can deal with Nick Ward. Love hearing @ClarkKelloggCBS on the call.
Purdue brought the wood on D today. Spartans only have six points in the first nine-plus minutes.

Ooohh Tremont Waters had a great driving opportunity for LSU but couldn't quite convert. Love that Will Wade didn't call time out. Mizzou by 1 going to the line with 2.2 to play.
Clear flagrant 1 on Dedric Lawson. Textbook hook and hold.
I dunno maybe give it to Lawson?
Kansas' offense is really bad right now. Kentucky cashing in with the Keldon Johnson three. Now leads by 6. Kansas time out.
LSU down 10 at Missouri with 11 mins to play. I've been touting the Tigers but they're running in quicksand tonight.
Guess tonight we get the bad Lagerald Vick

Tennessee ended the half on a 24-2 run. Leads West Va by 10.
West Va now up 16-5 at Tennessee. Hmmmmm....
This is the best offensive team Tony Bennett has ever coached.
@JackiJones positive!
Illinois has a chance to close out a big win over Maryland at MSG. Illini lines 68-61 with a little over a minute to play. Team has been knocking on the door for a while
Impressive win for Iowa State today. Owned Ole Miss on the road from start to finish.
@espnVshow Nobody puts me in the corner
Maryland and Illinois in a tight one at the Garden. Terps up 1 with 5:30 to play.
He grabbed that one from the top of the box
Zion Williamson jumps very high
Florida has been trailing TCU all game but has clawed its way back. Tied at 34 with 13 mins to play.
I honestly don't get Cam Reddish sometimes
Notre Dame is on the board at the 13:35 mark first half. There goes the shutout.
Notre Dame will probably score at some point right?
Georgia Tech is not messing around folks. Now up 35-27 in the second half in Cameron. Tre Jones just bricked a three pointer and Coach K called time out. Game on.
Duke down 2 to Ga Tech at home at half. 27 points is season low for Duke in any half.

Needless to say Pritchard had no business challenging that shot but still ... he never touched him. Heck of a way to lose a game.
Horrible foul call on Pritchard end of this Oregon-Washington game.
Washington getting great production off its bench tonight. Daggone this is a good time. And Isaiah Stewart coming.
What a job Chris Mack has done in year one.
Ja Morant doing the best he can on a bum ankle. He reminds me a lot of Kenny Anderson. More athletic but has that same ball-on-a-string handle and narrow frame. Same number too!
Totally cosign. Nobody works harder or prepares better than Fran, and he knows how to say more with less. https://t.co/k3sio8mvKB

@Ioway11 don't chirp too soon!
The guy with his arm underneath is the one who is hooking. You can't really hook without holding can you? Refs have been bombarded with video clips showing this exact play warranting a flagrant 1. https://t.co/DaTw4A2B2u
Still getting tweets about the Vandy flagrant call. You can have your opinions but not your own facts. That was a textbook hook and hold. There is no debating that. You can debate the merits of the rule, but it was applied correctly. Period. https://t.co/FNOnUt3cM9

@ronbarry21 thanks Ron!
@jpace87 yes I know! Thank for you for sending the pic.
If you don't see the hook it's because you don't want to look. When he jumped for the rebound Williams got tossed in the air and landed straight on his ribs. This is literally why the rule was written. Not. Close. https://t.co/TL6T1KWlTX
If you don't like the hook and hold rule, then argue it's a bad rule. But there is no argument that this was a correct application of the rule.
@Luke_Mueller24 @skuffel_waow @tsnmike textbook offensive foul. Was it not called?
Had a game tonight so just catching up to UT-Vandy on the laptop. The flagrant 1 on Vandy's Clevon Brown was absolutely correct. It was literally why the rule was written. Williams could have been seriously hurt. Refs got it right, not even close.
23 for 23. That’s how you get Capone.

This is a masterful job of insulting and complimenting me at the same time. Responses running 3 to 1 in favor of continuing troll feeding. Please keep the responses coming this is helpful (and cathartic). https://t.co/CsNwgtXZi3
Maybe the best way to do this is with a poll, though your comments are also appreciated. What say you about Sunday night troll feeding?
So my question is this. Do you want me to continue feeding the trolls on Sunday nights? Or does this "fun" exercise only add to the toxicity of Twitter? Should I retire it? What do you think? You are my followers, and I don't want to put you off. Please lmk.
I've been getting a lot of angry tweets from Va fans who either didn't know this was part of troll feeding or didn't find it funny. Tbh I'm batting about .333 on my one liners, but when I connect, it can be a moonshot. People seem to like it.
If my "insults" are read out of context or taken seriously then people's feelings get hurt. This was the case with something I tweeted at @DNeckel19 on Sunday. He is a well respected Va blogger. I meant no harm, and I apologize if it was over the top.
I then respond good naturedly (usually) with "insults" that engage my "trolls" in kind. Sometimes I argue the poll on the merits, but often I fire pithy one-liners that can be a little edgy. It's all in good fun.
Would like to ask my Twitter fam an honest question. As you know every Sunday night I conduct what I hope is a fun exercise called feeding the trolls. I tweet out my top 25 ballot, and my followers good naturedly (usually) challenge my choices
Can't you grade me on a curve? https://t.co/9MfDsi2u2w

Damn you Tom Brady for being so likable

Okay everyone stay out of the neutral zone
Free football in KC. We deserve it.
Edelman never touched it. Overturn.
@GaryParrishCBS I know you worship at the altar of @kenpomeroy. SOS rankings on his site: Duke 12 overall/48 noncon. Virginia 43/258. Duke has wins over Kentucky, Auburn, Texas Tech and....Virginia. Va's best wins were VT, Md and Wisc. Who has the better resume?
Big get for Mike Hopkins as Isaiah Stewart picks Washington.
We will have our weekly troll feeding after the AFC Championship. So enjoy the rest of the game you smelly foul-breathed hairy-knuckled pathetic little bridge dwellers.
Bill is also a Division I college basketball ref https://t.co/plO8AedyMX

Fan math: Jumping on Rams bandwagon &gt; Sticking with Redskins
Rams. Sharpie.
@GaryParrishCBS you say Virginia shouldn't be punished for losing a close game on the road. But shouldn't they at least be ranked behind the team that beat them, given that said team lost earlier in the week at home in overtime without two starters?

Tennessee has been my No. 1 for several weeks, but if you had Duke at 1 last week you have to keep them there last week. Lost to Syracuse without Reddish and Jones, beat UVa without Jones.
Great point https://t.co/GRmDsvoeZN
Annnnnnnnnd scene https://t.co/G7bwyRAW1q
Totally meaningless last bucket thr by DeAndre Hunter
Totally irrelevant whether Duke wins by three or four.
Big time rebound by Bolden. That's a winning play.
Are you living on a planet where officials don't receive enough scrutiny? Please send me your coordinates. https://t.co/b5leb0l9pa
I really think Kyle Guy should stop playing for Virginia so he can prepare for the NBA draft
If this is what it takes for his team to go on a run then he must not be a very good coach https://t.co/douCLY7dQj
You never see players get to the rim against Virginia the way Williamson and Barrett have tonight.
Love the move to zone for Duke when Bolden is in the game. I wonder if UVa practiced its zone offense it all in anticipation.
That's a HORRIBLE flagrant 1 call. One of the worst I've seen.
Ugly fall by Spencer but I don't think that's a flagrant on Washington
Can anyone tell me if Charles Barkley is at this game? I can't tell.
Herro with the answer again.
Harper for three. Down to three.
Make that 18 for Brown. Auburn on 11-0 run and trailing by three.
Loooootttta time on that clock too
Auburn now within six. The defense has woken up. Bryce Brown has 15 pts this half.
USC now up 22 on UCLA. Carry on.
There's a difference between being the best coach and the most accomplished. I know greatness when I see it. I don't need numbers and banners. https://t.co/z73uRUz7VL
Also if you think the loss to UMBC should define Tony Bennett more than the way he handled that loss in the aftermath, then you need to re-evaluate everything about your life.
In last 5 years UVa has made five straight NCAAs, two Sweet 16s and an Elite Eight. By any standard Tony is as good as any coach in America. He may be the best. If you pick one game to define him you are trolling or not smart. There is no other option.
I'll answer that one. In the 12 years before Tony got there, the Cavs had made the NCAA tournament three times, and never got out of the first weekend. https://t.co/R30KN0EGnN
@blackwell_phil fair enough
Bruce Pearl's clothes never have enough wick

Kentucky now on a 16-2 run. Cats have turned Auburn's water off as @ClarkKelloggCBS would say
You know why? Because he calls a lot of big games. You know why? Because the coaches want him there. You know why? Because he's a great ref. https://t.co/rCaIJ4ShcC
Or maybe the ref should go over to the announcer's table and tell the guy...."Listen you just split an infinitive. And the guy you just said was from Brooklyn? He's actually from Long Island. Just terrible."
I'm just the guy to do it https://t.co/3nD77hp7nB
Just once I would like to see a ref stop a game, storm over to the sideline and scream in the coach's face...WHAT KIND OF DUMBASS PLAY DID YOU DRAW UP THERE??!!! YOU ARE TERRIBLE!!!
Virginia is the last unbeaten team in America. Let us behold the amazing job that Tony Bennett has done there. Save the stupid UMBC references. The guy is great.
I love that you volunteer your time but with all due respect if you are proud of getting tossed from a kids hockey game you need to maybe re-evaluate some things. https://t.co/BpB2gX5fpm
Louisville up 36-7 on Ga Tech with five minutes to go in the first half. Not a typo.
When a coach is going off on the refs, he's telling his players two things. One, this game is rigged against us, so it doesn't matter how hard we try. Second, it's okay to lose your composure.
Maybe if coaches would spend more energy coaching their players instead of working the refs their players would play a little better.
Agree https://t.co/e9kWW22sA4
Tennessee survives. Game effort by the Tide comes up short.
Tennesse....foul up three please
John Petty called for the travel. Not sure about that one.
That's Willliams' fifth foul. Dairy Queen.
Offensive foul on Grant Williams. Excellent D by Dontae Hall. Bama ball down 1 with 11 seconds to play.
The problem in the American isn't the refs. It's the coaches. Gregg Marshall is out of control right now. Toss him.
Amazing block by Grant Williams. Vols hanging on to one point lead with 1:12 to play in Knoxville.
West Virginia. Sharpie.
All tied up in Knoxville, Three and a half minutes to play.
So much Bernard King in John Petty
Kansas up two now at West Va with 12:30 to play.
Alabama scored 16 straight points and now leads Tennessee by 1 in Knoxville under 17 mins to go. First time all season Tennessee has trailed at home in the second half.
Could have been a flagrant on Nassir Brooks. Looked like a clear hook and hold.
Romeo Langford only played six minutes in the first half because of foul trouble. Only has two fouls though so should be good to go in second half.
Purdue leads 33-26 at half. Ended half on a 6-0 run.
might be a plus for Auburn. I like when they play smaller and quicker. https://t.co/E9KtxvEvK3

West Virginia hanging with Kansas so far. Down 1 with 2:14 left in first half.
This looks like the Rob Phinessee we saw before he got hurt.
It's gonna be awfully hard for a coach in the American to get teed up today.
Romeo Langford picks up two fouls in the first three minutes. Not the way Indiana wants to start.
Florida wins the last 10 minutes, beats Georgia by 10 on the road. Gators can really guard.
What has two thumbs and picked Wisconsin for @TheAthleticCBB? https://t.co/FEdiGLc5jE
Wisconsin. Sharpie.
Rarely see Beilein this angry.
Huge call. Intentional foul on Brazdeikis who was fouling Happ well away from the ball.
Huge three by Livers. Wisconsin up three with the  ball under a minute to play.
Time for Hack a Happ
Badgers by four with 5:51 to play. Michigan's like a vampire, have to drive a stake right through their hearts to finish them off.
Excellent charge call there on Luke Maye. Lowered his shoulder and plowed over secondary defender. Well done Mr. Referee Sir.
Unbelievable work here by Georgia. Now leads the Gators by two. 19-7 run.
@tsnmike so was the guy in the Miami game
Ethan Happ gives the Badgers the lead with 7:30 to play. Buckle up kids.
Somebody clip that non charge on Brad Davison for @tsnmike. Textbook defense not rewarded by the refs. @dandakich thinks refs are biased against him.
I see you Turtle Jackson! Georgia now within 1 with 16 mins to play. What a second half start for the Bulldogs.
Georgia came out firing second half. Starts with 7-0 run. Now trails Florida by 3 on CBS.
Michigan already 11 turnovers. Average 9.5 per game. Wisconsin not the most disruptive team either
Aleem Ford three pointer gives Wisconsin a one-point lead under 13 mins to play. We've got a good one in Mad Town.
The halftime act in Athens now showing on our big screen. Be still my heart. https://t.co/o4Dar3Vcq4
Miami and UNC tied at the half in Coral Gables. Hurricanes have had some pretty bad fades down the stretch.
Probably not but it's close. Mike knows the rules very well, so he can tell you that a defender can still be moving and take a charge. Little clearly initiated the contact regardless. https://t.co/40EPBrJmT3
Michigan up two at the half in Madison despite no points from Iggy or Matthews. Badgers gotta keep things close and hope to pull it out in the end.

Kaleb Wesson just took a textbook charge on Bruno Fernando. I will await the @tsnmike tweet with video praising the official.

My dream is to call a college hoops game with @tsnmike @rex_rexchapman and @GottliebShow reffing.
Not only that but all referees must be perfect. They should have the same rate of accuracy in live action as the rest of us do when watching a play frame by frame https://t.co/skC1yGhInt

Awaiting Scottie Pippen comment that Tre Jones should not play the rest of the season to prepare for the draft.
Okay let's try this once more. I'm looking for the best names of CURRENT college hoops players. Playing this season. Go.
Great news for Duke. Coach K tells @DanaONeilWriter at @TheAthleticCBB that Tre Jones' injury is not as bad as initially feared. Unlikely but not impossible he plays Saturday vs Virginia. https://t.co/pZlzYt9WWd

Iowa State up 4 AT Texas Tech 2:48 to play on ESPNU.
Need to watch a longer sequence but looks to me like Hurley deserved to get tossed. Refs were trying to cool things off and ordered him to stay in the box. Last thing they want is him walking to the Tulsa bench for any reason. https://t.co/z5D3F7A0HI

Virginia on pace to score 88 points.
All of the attention is on Virginia’s defense but this is clearly the best offensive team Tony Bennett has had there. He has never had this many weapons or a pro prospect like DeAndre Hunter. Now up 32-19 on Va Tech.
So what's the verdict on this plus/minus stat? Do we like having it in the box score? Do I trust it?

@Candace_Parker Beautiful!
Never forget https://t.co/dGoyAoBHPY
Kansas survives. Barely.
For Duke the disappointment in losing this game pales in comparison to the concern of Tre Jones' shoulder. Hopefully it's just a stinger because as you saw tonight this is a very different team without him.
Two days ago Syracuse lost at home to Georgia Tech by 14 points. Because college basketball.
Syracuse. Sharpie.
Zion and Barrett miss back to back threes and it looks like Duke is going down. What a win for Syracuse.
Where has this Tyus Battle been?
That definitely was a phantom foul call that put Zion on the line. That's a ref anticipating rather than reacting.
Free basketball in Cameron. We deserve it.
Battle game winner coming...
Zion makes one of two. Game is tied at 85 Syracuse ball. Duke has two fouls to give. 10.6 secs left.
Love Coach K not calling the time out. Zion gets fouled headed to the line down 1.
Tyus Battle with the tough contested three followed by an O'connell turnover. Cuse by 1 with the ball.
Man seeing that replay of Tre Jones getting hurt and his reaction.....that did not look good
@prominentplay sorry I just assume most women are too smart to follow me on Twitter
@ChiefGoodfriend read them one of my books they'll go right to sleep
Great block by Bolden. Huge play.
Shows how important Tre Jones is to Duke.
Syracuse up one with three minutes to go in Cameron. Stop talking to your wife and kids and get to ESPN pronto.
Meanwhile Pitt is up by 6 at home against Florida State with 9 mins to play on ESPNU.
Zion is Zioning
Indiana was never in it. Nebraska pulls off the 15-point road win. Hoosiers have lost three straight.
actually I prefer we never talk https://t.co/VK8MwdIGtG
would never say Bias would have been a better pro than those guys. He was better in college than Jordan imo. https://t.co/omaHegZJm3
Tre Jones not in the game for Duke to start the second half. Looks like he's not playing again tonight. Hope he's okay. Had a nasty collision in the first half and appeared to hurt his shoulder.
Nebraska is up 14 at Indiana under 10 minutes to play. Huskers need a quality road win in the worst way.
Elijah Hughes drinks green juice.
Tre Jones had to leave the Duke-Syracuse game in the first half after a nasty collision. Looked like he hurt his shoulder. Devils were already minus Cam Reddish who was out sick. Lead by two with 9 mins to go first half in Cameron.
For the evening crowd, made some news with this week's Hoop Thoughts. Kansas is asking the NCAA to reinstate Silvio De Sousa. They are hoping he could play as soon as this weekend. Plus my top 25 and lots more. @TheAthleticCBB https://t.co/2213a2Gjay

They're third in the country in offensive efficiency so they must be doing something right McLovin. https://t.co/w8LJyZAKVO
Seton Hall lost at De Paul at full strength. St. John's was missing Ponds. Close call but that's why I am a genius. https://t.co/QbBhthFnTX

Four quality losses. Took Gonzaga to the wire on the road. My ballot my opinion. https://t.co/wvGDETCk00
that is an excellent point because everyone plays the same teams every game and every won loss record is equal because I am a doltish troll who types without thinking https://t.co/LonlGIIu09

UConn down 2 with the ball and Vital gets called for offensive push off. Cincy escapes in OT.
It's almost like @JonRothstein is known for tweeting clever pet phrases that are now being prolifically applied to his deadly assault on a defenseless rodent.
I was not afraid of the mouse but I certainly did not condone its untimely demise. Not what George Bailey would have done I can tell you that.
tweet of the year https://t.co/2iUbYsIlE5
Just for the record a mouse has been crawling through the news room here at @CBSSportsNet and @JonRothstein just killed it with the top of a recycling bin. It was cold blooded. As you were.
Washington up 10-0 at Colorado. Best team in the Pac 12.
Alterique Gilbert's slashing layup for UConn sends the game to OT at Cincy.
Kentucky up 5 on Vandy 12:30 to play. Houston up 1 at home on Wichita State 10 mins to play on @CBSSportsNet
Another three by Vital and UConn leads by 1. Huskies on a 9-0 run.
UConn not going away quietly. Christian Vital three cuts Cincy's lead to two under 5 mins to play.
you must be new to Twitter https://t.co/nDg14oDeXI
Vanderbilt up early 16-4 on Kentucky in Rupp. Hmmmm.
Syracuse down 17 to Georgia Tech at home. Heavy is the head that wears my Buy Plus rating. Oy.

Another nice win. Quietly stringing em together. https://t.co/jbx2Qs5SL2
Quite a window of games that just wrapped up. I need a cigarette.
Duke. Sharpie.
Wondering if they used Barrett as a decoy and called the play for Reddish as the first option. What a big time shot by a kid who has really been struggling.
So that happened
Looks like someone told Ted Valentine there's another angle
Do they have another angle on the replay? Off White's foot?
Let's have two more replay reviews and a commercial. Please.
Fair to say FSU needs to prevent Barrett from getting the ball. Better to use him as a decoy.
Can they put Zion back in for the lob?
That's gonna be Duke's ball
Short armed it
Clear out coming for RJ here. Not a tough call.
Marquette up three on Seton Hall with the ball with three seconds left.
Man Reddish has had a great game and then leaves his feet at worst time. Fouls three point shooter. Savoy on the line.
Here. We. Go.
Texas Tech closing out a win at Texas. Up 7 with 9.7 secs to play.
Oklahoma up 1 on TCU headed to the line 26.2 secs to play.
Seton Hall and Marquette in a great one. Powell three pointer puts the Hall up 1 with under 3 mins to play.
Cam Reddish now has 20 pts. Good bounceback game for him.
Would be pretty remarkable if Duke pulls this off without Zion for the last 21 minutes.
easy call https://t.co/OJvLUHrVfz
Phenomenal road win by Ole Miss. Toughness, heart and chemistry.
Best Ole Miss-Miss State regular hoops game ever?
Great D by the Rebs. Ole Miss ballup 2 with 10.9 secs to play. Get to CBS!
Bad shot by Weatherspoon. Little panic there. Ole MIss up with 26.5 secs left.
TCU up 6 at Oklahoma at halftime
Heck of a game on CBS. Ole Miss leads Miss St by four with 3:03 to play in Starkville. How about the job Kermit Davis has done with this group.
As soon as I tweet that FSU goes on a run. Seminoles end half on 10-0 run and now lead by one.
Ole Miss up three at Miss State with 5:30 to play. Gonna be a fun finish on CBS.
It's early but Duke is very much in command at Florida State. This is an outstanding defensive team. Travels well.
I've said it often: There's a difference between intensity and emotion. Love the passion in Miss-Miss St game but needs to be properly channeled or else it leads to bad decisions. https://t.co/N2EqUkobfq
Georgetown in another OT game at Providence. Friars by three with 13 secs remaining.
I like Virginia's chances to cover that six point spread.
NO  MORE REPLAYS!!!!!!!
Carolina getting absolutely run out of the Dean Dome by Louisville right now. Pretty embarrassing.
Coby White landed hard on a drive and is holding his wrist. Leaving the game. Heels down 16 at 10 min mark second half.
Pitt up 3 at NC State under 15 mins to play. Panthers are no pushovers.
This game is chippy. Gonna be a fun one.
Hawkeyes https://t.co/7YwgODyT1n
Nice midrange pullup by Tyree. Looks like we're in business. Rebels up 3 at Miss St on CBS midway first half.
Louisville still up 11 at UNC under 15 minutes to play. Cards are coming off a disappointing loss at Pitt. Looks like Chris Mack got after his guys in practice. Love the culture he is building there.
Dean Wade makes his return for Kansas State today, and the Wildcats are up 4 at Iowa State with 12 mins to play.
Tyree back in the game for Ole Miss but looks like he's badly hurt. Not sure he can go.
First minute of the game and Ole Miss leading scorer Breein Tyree hurt his left shoulder running into a screen. Looked to be in significant pain and headed to the locker room. Hope he's okay.

@vondoviak I’m not a big fiction reader but saw your book atop a year end list, bought it and just finished it. Bravo!
Great win for Purdue at Wisconsin. These Big Ten games must be so draining for everyone involved. It is going to be a long grinding season.
Free basketball in Madison
D’Mitrik ICE hit a three to tie it up. Painter declined to call a time out and Edwards took a bad one. Badgers ball 3.2 seconds left.
Oh come on Carsen. What an awful shot.
Trice accidentally banks a three. Purdue up 1 on the line.
Carsen Edwards drinks green juice.
Brad Davison takes a charge and buries a three. Take that haters! Purdue and Wisconsin tied up in Madison with 2:22 to play on FS1.

I’ve been saying for a while I think Washington is the best team in the Pac 12. Huskies won at Utah last night by 16.
UCLA wins in OT. Unreal. The Murry Bartow Era is off to an excellent start.
UCLA was down 17 at one point. Sounds like Oregon fouled up three and it backfired.
I turned off the UCLA-Oregon game because I thought it was over, and now they're going into OT. Gracious sakes alive!

@coachorell @JPtheSportsGuy thanks guys!
Jarrett Culver 23 and 13 for Texas Tech.
ESPN is reporting that Cam Johnson went out because of leg cramps. Huge exhale.
Meanwhile Texas Tech successfully held off Oklahoma. Chris Beard ladies and gentlemen.
Give North Carolina credit. I've been questioning their toughness all season, but they have a chance to win a really tough road game with their leading scorer gone the last 10 mins.
Miss State and South Carolina now in OT in Columbia.
Miss St with an impressive answer. Aric Holman three puts Bulldogs up 4 under 5 minutes to play.
South Carolina, which just won at Florida, now up 5 at home over No. 14 Mississippi State under 11 mins to play in Columbia.
Oklahoma has been leading Texas Tech for most of the night in Lubbock. Sooners now up 1 with 11 mins to go.
Cam Johnson goes down hurt for UNC. Hoping it's just a cramp or something.
Best way to beat a team like North Carolina is to slow em down and make em grind. That's not how NC State plays tho. So that's the challenge. Heels have been in control all game but it's tight.
Hugely impressive road win for Maryland tonight at Minnesota. Mad respect.
Braxton Beverly lost a shoe, took some time to get it on, ran downcourt ... and buried a three. It's on in Raleigh tonight.
For a guy who went to Yale Makai Mason just made a really dumb defensive play. Refs saved him by not calling the obvious foul up three and Baylor knocks off Ipwa State at home.
Great finish coming up o FS1. Nova up 1 on St. John's with the ball 2 mins to play.
I see you Jahvon Quinerly
Baylor up 8 at home over Iowa State at halftime.
Duke and Wake Forest tied at 28 with 5:30 to play in the first half.
@NHRJimFuller what took you so long?
Kentucky now up eight. Was fun while it lasted.
@ChrisHHowell my man!!
It is pretty amazing Duke leads the country in blocks without a classic rim protector
Y'all can watch Zion, I'm locked in on Shamorie tonight....

Keep in mind my wife and I see like two adult movies a year. I want to laugh and be uplifted.

@patmazzarella love that. I need to read more of Hunter's stuff.
@ReePieper close your eyes and listen closely I bet you can hear him
Thanks but not true. Just another dad who loves his kids and does his best and makes a ton of mistakes. https://t.co/AUn4h8iJJG
It won't surprise you that my boys are huge sports fans. Sports is a GREAT way for fathers and sons to connect. Outside of college hoops they tend to know more than I do. It's also a great window to talk about larger issues of morality.
My oldest son is not a big talker in the car. So I ask him to play me music. That means listening to a lot of explicit lyrics but it's worth it to let him share the art he likes. I keep an open mind and tell him which songs and artists I like.
I don't always enforce it but I have a rule that they are not allowed on their phones in my car. I hand them my phone and let them deejay on Spotify. When they want to make me happy they play Thunder Road.
When people ask me how well my sons get along, my answer is, "As well as can be expected." They fight all the time but always want to be together. I like to say they drive me crazy and keep me sane at the same time.
I hope I'm not coming across as preachy. The most important thing you can do as a parent is listen. Also @JonGordon11 my word of the year is PATIENCE. I wish I had more of it. I am a real grouch at night when I am tired and they won't go to bed.
Movies, books and art are a great thing to share. We sing the soundtrak to Hamilton all the time. It's a history lesson too! When my oldest son cried at the end of Forrest Gump I told him, "I like that you cry in movies. It means you'll be a good husband."
@CoachBilly1 that is awesome and it means you will be a great dad
Not for nothing, but I did not like A Star Is Born. I paid money to see that, and real life is depressing enough.
I tell them all the time: The number one thing that successful people have in common is they read a LOT. https://t.co/zSfeIDsnYZ
That is great. I have pet sayings to my boys when I drop them off at school. When my oldest leaves my car for high school I tell him, "Proud of you." When I drop my youngest in third grade I kiss him and say "Be kind." https://t.co/SZzjnY5a0S
@ryan_wakefield Thanks Ryan! Just sharing how I feel.
@oklucasgo so glad to hear it. Well done!
@all_metelite @j4rv15_ Nice job but I will never be happy about a Landon win
Yes, because by the same token our definition of femininity is also evolving. I mean this sincerely: Women are smarter and tougher than men. You think we'd put up with child bearing? No F'ing way. https://t.co/GojMgEPVwK
I can't tell you how many older coaches have said to me, "I knew my father loved me, but he never said it." So tragic.
I am grateful that our interpretation of masculinity is evolving. Older generations of men did not express their feelings or show vulnerability. There is nothing more manly than hugging your sons and crying at the end of It's A Wonderful Life.
so true and so sad https://t.co/i7fR34oLzD
The reading thing is huge. Like I said, actions matter. "If you want to achieve it you have to emphasize it." I always make time to read to my boys at night. I read my youngest Of Mice and Men recently. He cried at the end, as he should have.
@TrumpNeeds2Go yes he is!! thank you

Absolutely. Tolerance for all races, religions, creeds, etc. Doing the right thing when no one is looking. Compassion in the face of anger. Sticking up for those who need it, even when it's hard. Say please and thank you a LOT. https://t.co/6lvieg24ks
Absolute poetry from @AdamKilgoreWP https://t.co/NzrJnAoAzx

@rex_rexchapman how about the fact that Kentucky didn't play well on the road against a good team and still had a great look to win it. I was impressed.
Just seeing the Azubuike news. Lost for the season for Kansas. Huge bummer. I know they played smallball without him before, but this is a lousy three-point shooting team. Will the streak finally end?

Good start to the second half for the Hoosiers. They were about to get run out of Crisler but now trail by 11 at the under 16 time out.
This was a pathetic and blatant ploy to get retweeted by me. It worked of course. https://t.co/yTXnnvvu39
It is literally the worst idea ever https://t.co/X3GLlo3BAR
There it is! https://t.co/Iy9mAMTIgW
Guess we got the bad Lagerald Vick tonight for Kansas: 6 pts, zero free throws, 1 assist, 7 turnovers.
truth https://t.co/Uhw4sQBnLL
There's nothing more American than rooting against the Cowboys
Ole Miss about to win at Vanderbilt. Just another night in college hoops.
If I gave you New Mexico plus 28 would you have taken it?
New Mexico. Sharpie.
BREAKING: Winning conference road games is hard.
New Mexico now up 22 on Nevada under 7 minutes to play. Not ready to Sharpie em but....
Don't see the second half comeback materializing for Nevada. Down by 16 points with 10 mins to play at New Mexico. Get ready for the @kenpomeroy tweet.
I am truly amazed by this https://t.co/ndUdO6QlwA
That was the worst best missed dunk I've ever seen
@JonGordon11 Thanks Jon!!!
Nevada trails New Mexico by 12 at the half in Albuquerque. The Pit is rocking tonight.
Three fouls on Reddish and two on Zion. Duke's in a game.
@Eaton73Ryan @kevinkugler Kevin carried me as usual
Duke hasn't played in 16 days. Gotta expect some rest. Also has yet to play a road game.
I'm told Udoka Azubuike is going to have an MRI on his wrist tomorrow. No timetable as of yet on his return.
Never too early! https://t.co/NBfA56v7wd
Nevada down 22-9 early at New Mexico. Wolf Pack have been a second half team all season. Playing with fire?
I'm always right https://t.co/WGE3JPym2Z
I think I recognize that place https://t.co/oGXyNhBRuC
Nope https://t.co/oJM8VHouPg
FSU closed the game on a "meaningless" 16-0 run. Almost got through the back door! https://t.co/nudssR1cwD
Back to back threes by Halliburton and Wigginton, and the Cyclones are up by 13 with under 10 minutes to play. Kansas' biggest deficit of the season.
Very impressive that Iowa State is doing this without much contribution from Lindell Wigginton. Team has a lot of upside.
Have a great time! cc: @StephenCurry30 https://t.co/hF0v857zQI

Also looks like Killian Tille and Geno Crandall will be back for Gonzaga tonight. Fully healthy the Zags are my pick to win the national championship. They got dudes.
No Azubuike for Kansas today against Iowa State. He hurt his wrist.
I’m off to a 4-1 start in my ATS picks today. Lots of hoops still to come. Get em while they’re hot! ⁦@TheAthleticCBB⁩  https://t.co/zBBznbvGpH
Utah up 4 at Arizona under 7 minutes to go.
Hoyas guard Jahvon Blair had a clean look at a game tying three but couldn't convert. St. John's gets a huge win in OT. Stick around as we show Chris Mullen and Patrick Ewing playing a game of one on one.
This is Shamorie Ponds' tenth 30-plus game at St. John's.
What a sequence! Great Ponds steal leads to Justin Simon alleyoop dunk, and the Johnnies are up by six with under a minute to go in OT. Great action on CBS right now.
Reversed at the monitor. Georgetown ball.
Turnover Hoyas! St. John's with the ball down three. Get to CBS.
Good finish coming up on CBS. Georgetown up 3 on St. John's with 34 secs left.
NO MORE REPLAYS OF ANY KIND!!!!!!
Great second half action right now. St. John's up 1 on Georgetown on CBS. Bama up 3 on Kentucky on ESPN.
If he stays healthy Shamorie Ponds is gonna play for 15 years in the NBA. He's perfect for today's game--a wiz of a ballhandler, quick release, a shooter and a scorer.
Cassius Winston put the Spartans on his back and is carrying them to a highly impressive win in Columbus.
Should be a good one! Enjoy. https://t.co/BzHtwQW3g4
She is a saint https://t.co/XBa8lUDqa8
The view from the desk. We got action! https://t.co/uaBqnuH8aT
I'm glad Georgetown forward Jessie Govan is getting a national showcase today. One of the really good, unknown players in the country. Hoyas up 7 with 12 mins to go first half on CBS
In other words...this isn't Fed Ex Field! https://t.co/if4pHn7ZTh

If Rick wants to coach in college again (and I believe he does) there is a good chance he will have that opportunity. It might be at a high major, but that's probably a stretch. And it won't be at UCLA. https://t.co/RP6f1WTOO5
I think Rick Pitino is a great coach, and in a lot of ways I think he has gotten a raw deal in being blamed for recent "scandals." But let's be clear: There is a better chance that Barack Obama will be UCLA's next coach than Pitino. I mean that literally.
it's almost like there's a pattern here https://t.co/bqhAtgPaDn
That is actually not true. He did not pay recruits and he did not give UCLA players money. But he hooked them up with plenty of benefits outside NCAA rules once they got there and represented many of them in their pro contract negotiations. https://t.co/KFPsF7tjGY
Wooden was a great coach and a better person, but he was not perfect. The way he handled Sam Gilbert and, more important, spoke about him after he retired is not him at his best. Bottom line is he made compromises and never quite owned them. https://t.co/Ug7ep4qfsw
His name was Sam Gilbert. I wrote all about him in the book. There was nothing secret about what he did. The NCAA and Wooden dug around a little and then put down their shovels. https://t.co/RE8pYeRzIg
She raised an amazing son https://t.co/iOnr82yOI1
@TheRealRChmela Thanks!
@BodaciousBeer Thanks!
Denny was Wooden’s choice. JD Morgan didn’t want him. JD was arguably the most powerful AD ever. https://t.co/DjE4Ub6dZr
Actually 32,500. The school never took care of him the way it should have https://t.co/uDOrcNXMFE
Actually I wrote a whole book about it. Wooden's story about how he decided to retire was a total falsehood, and he knew it. He decided before the season and told his AD, not at the Final Four like he claimed. https://t.co/dDl3ixIGC1
@darrenrovell I could recommend a good book on the subject! Wooden knew before the season it was going to be his last. He and J.D. Morgan worked on it all season. Bartow secretly flew to https://t.co/VljyPclhu5 interview. Wooden was dishonest in the aftermath.
The interesting back story is that Wooden did not tell the truth about when he decided to step down. He always said it was spur at the moment at the Final Four. Truth is that it was all in place several months before. https://t.co/rtjalSKSO8
@KyleBargerPart2 you know you're the first person to ask me. I bought that T shirt when I was in high school. You never know!
Washington is the best team in the Pac 12. Carry on.
Two breakaway buckets by Dupree McBrayer gives Minnesota a 55-47 lead at Wisconsin with 54.6 seconds left. Never a dull moment in this league.
Minnesota up 4 at Wisconsin under 3 minutes to play. Would be huge for the Gophers if they can pull this out.
Lawdy lawdy Arizona State. Bout to lose at home by double digits to Utah.
I guess reports of Iowa's improved defense were a mite premature. Lost at Purdue tonight, 86-70.
NC State has been trailing at Miami for most of the night but now leads by 3 with 5 mins to play in Coral Gables.
Bol Bol is done. Should we still even bother to play the season? Sad face emoji.

This is not even debatable https://t.co/uj8DMdKe22
To me the reason to go to eight games is to make the regular season MORE relevant. Those games down the stretch in November will mean a lot more if the teams have something to play for.
I am in favor of the playoff expanding to eight teams but the idea that a blowout semifinal game SUPPORTS that idea strikes me as rather illogical.
Using this game to argue Notre Dame didn’t belong in the playoff will be a nice play holder until everyone bugs out when Nevada and Gonzaga both get No. 1 seeds.

Mary's gotta be thinking "uh....wtf was that about?"
Violet changed her mind. She's staying home too.
God bless you garlic eater
I busted the juke-a box too!
But when Uncle Billy gives her credit she shakes him off.
It was Mary's idea. Of course it was.
Mary says it's a miracle. It's not a miracle. It's what happens when you treat people well and live a selfless life.
Not a smidge of temperature!

Hey your mouth's bleeding.
I want to live again.
Also I don't believe Mary never married. She's too good of a catch.
Of course if George wasn't born Harry probably wouldn't have been on the ice that day but let's just go with it.
You see George you've really had a wonderful life.
Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry.
Amazing isn't it. Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around he leaves an awful hole.
His own mother....
What he wouldn't give to grab that broken bannister....
I love the way these guys drop "see" in their sentences...  And I ain't never seen you before in my life, see.  We stopped talking like this unfortunately
Because George was never born Ernie's wife left him and took the kid....okay that's a stretch

How does Clarence know about what happened with Mr. Gower? Why won't George believe him? Calls him a hypnotist?
The worst is how Mr. Gower tries to laugh along to make it okay

great point. I'm glad his tree got messed up. https://t.co/3yjnG7agFk
Look at all the excuses George will make to explain what is happening. The clothes are dry because the stove is hotter than he thought.
Although I've never understood why it stopped snowing.
The first thing that happens is George gets his hearing back in his left ear. The bread crumbs will lead us back.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Well you look like about the kind of an angel I'd get.  Another classic line perfectly delivered.
Clarence just assumes everyone understands him because they believe in angels. I wish we could all be so blissfully ignorant.
Clarence knew that George would be more focused on saving him than killing himself. Clarence knows George.
There's that Tom Sawyer book again. I wonder why we keep getting reminded of it?
I passed away in it.
The dude in the boathouse is classic
Damn that is a sweet dive
Clarence!
George's mouth is bleeding.  We should remember that.
Mr. Welsh just happens to be at the barstool next to him on Christmas Eve. There are no coincidences.
This is the first time we hear George praying.
Mr. Gower is the glue guy https://t.co/R8rO7lzWyt

Eisenberg? https://t.co/fltaF5332d
George's car door won't open so he has to climb in. Story of his life.
It never even occurs to George to ask the "riff raff" for money. Mr. Potter thinks they'd run him out of town on a rail. All that money and no wisdom.
That look on George's face....you're worth more dead than alive. It is scary.
Mr. Potter looks surprised George is taking the blame for misplacing the money. Mr. Potter is not so smart after all.
George is offering Mr. Potter what always wanted ... the Building and Loan. Potter won't take it because he wants to gloat. Like I said...pride cometh before the fall!
George has just traumatized his family. What is their response? To pray for him. Love is the best, man.
The looks on those kids' faces is very jarring. For the first time they are understanding that their dad is not perfect.
I dunno I don't think George is handling all of this very well at the moment
George tells Zuzu that in her dreams her flower will be a whole garden. When did he stop dreaming like that?
Zuzu's petals!
The bannister is broken. Maybe we should remember that.  And we should remember that George almost chucks it.
"Why do we have to have all these kids?"  Okay I might have said that once or twice too
We have a doctor who pays house calls and a phone you have to operate with two hands

All George has to do is tell Mary what happened. She can fix it. Of course then the movie would be over and that wouldn't be any fun.
I agree but in the end it's his teammates that carry him through https://t.co/7wYbTe2Ahs
it certainly wasn't meant as a compliment. We were all "them" at one time. Nice to be reminded of that. https://t.co/z51zE90mO5
True. But I also think it contributes to his underlying sense of inadequacy. https://t.co/TocyoQJBL7
We are all the squirrel.
The worst thing Uncle Billy could do is disappoint George.
George instantly knows how bad this situation is. And he does not panic easily.
Potter's life is a prison. https://t.co/5nnxRqZ0lD
George doesn't just give Violet some money. He gives her encouragement. Because George.
The fear in Uncle Billy's eyes cuts me like a cold wind
We know Mr. Potter is a tool. But how about the guy who pushes him around and knows what he did? Where is your decency?
THE NEWSPAPER!!! FOR GOD'S SAKE UNCLE BILLY YOU LEFT THE MONEY IN THE NEWSPAPER!!!!!!!
Mr. Potter really thinks George would be jealous of Harry's heroism? Dumbass.
I think Mr. Carter's family is fine if he's a little late getting home for Christmas
I'm already dreading it https://t.co/niVOlo0SZr
"Yes, I suppose they do those things."  The bank examiner ladies and gentlemen.
What'd they have to eat?  In a plane?  Guy has like six lines in the movie but they're money.
Now Joseph shows Clarence what happened today.  Here we go....
He spits tobacco on himself. Love that guy.
Harry Bailey topped them all.
What genius named Potter the head of the draft board?
George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Close second https://t.co/VXHAbSYzV9
I never knew that until I read Geno Auriemma's book. What would today's version be? A bunch of taco eaters? We are always afraid of the "other." Yet we are all a part of the wonderful melting pot that is AMERICA. https://t.co/dp3s6uCpjC
that is serious dough https://t.co/ibB2mV12O0
@JohnMKlaassen thanks John!
"Why would you ever marry a guy like me?"  Haven't we all asked our wives that question at least once?
George hears his dreams in his head. But he doesn't see Mary lying in his bed. He thinks she wants money, she wants a honeymoon. He is her dream.
I love that George keeps the cigar.
"In the whole vast configuration of things I'd say you were nothing more than a scurvy little spider."  Has there been a better movie line uttered ever?
"playing nursemaid to a bunch of garlic eaters"  Mr. Potter is referring to Italian immigrants. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Give Mr. Potter credit. He knows how to push George's buttons. The truth hurts.

Capra wants us not to like Sam. Maybe he will surprise us in the end.
That guy calls the Baileys chumps because they don't think about money first. Who's the chump, chump?
George has no cash. Everything he has is tied up in other people's houses. https://t.co/HN2Nv8QqIG
Bailey Park is not a threat to Mr. Potter's money. It is only a threat to his pride. That is what comes before the fall.
Sam's money makes George feel inadequate. He has a thing for money ... then again don't we all.
I love that the fundamental dynamic at play is that George creates homes for other people. Not just houses. Homes.
He's at my house watching with me https://t.co/4uYnE7ka3p
noted! Thank you. https://t.co/Kj5mzmwCjK
didn't know that! https://t.co/N9HGkGmkGb
Mary's in the mood for some luvin....lucky bastard
The record player turning the chicken in front of the fireplace is a nice touch
This scene would be a lot more romantic if the taxi driver wasn't in the house
So nice of Ernie and Bert to do this for him. George has great friends. I hope he remembers that when times get tough.

Just heated up some pizza and poured a tall glass of red wins so if my tweets start getting a little more edge you will know why.
I love that Mrs. Davis only wants $17.50. Davises are awesome!!!
"Sure, Tom, I've got your 242 dollars. Now if you would drop your pants and bend over so I can shove it straight up your ...."  George's thought bubble
Five minutes ago Mary was telling George not to stop. Now she is offering to give up their honeymoon cash. Mary is badass.
I always found it sad that Uncle Billy couldn't make George's wedding. He is the closest thing George has left to a father.
Amazing that that man's granddaughter was the cutie in E.T.
George instantly sees through Mr. Potter's ruse. He is smarter than Mr. Potter and they both know it.
Uncle Billy likes birds and squirrels. I like Uncle Billy.
Finally! George gets a great trip out of Bedford Falls. Unless something unexpected happens...
It is pouring rain on George's wedding day. Of course.
with minimal contact too. The tension and expectation is always better. https://t.co/t5qfZta7Ry
She never had a chance against Mary. That woman is savage. https://t.co/4TTmvQB1BL
And he delivers the best line in the movie. But you have to admit that was a dick move. https://t.co/Lw9ZiEB7RV

No doubt your mom is smiling back! https://t.co/tYIwMEL8Rj
Supposedly there was a much longer monologue in the script but Jimmy Stewart forgot it because he wanted to kiss her so badly. Or he said he was so nervous about the kiss he forgot the lines.
George has no money to invest in Sam's company, but he has Mary.  Who's the richer man?
In the end, it's the smell of Mary's hair that does it. I bet it smells like angels.
It would not surprise Mary to learn that Sam is canoodling with another gal while he talks to her.
George shoots daggers at Mary's mom with his eyes
Oooh Mary playing the jealousy card with Sam. You're no match for her, George.
He came back to get the hat. If he hadn't forgotten it.....  There are no accidents.
He tosses his hat down on the table. What if he hurries out and forgets it?
lol George that's your future mother in law
Mary desperately wants George to come in, but when he gets crabby she says, "Would you rather leave?"  This is not a woman to be trifled with.
"I see it still smells like pine needles around here."  Not your best work, George.
Of course his mother called.
Why did men stop wearing fedoras by the way? It's JFK's fault? Can we bring that back? @ClarkKelloggCBS will lead the way.
And we can uh ... swim in it.
George goes the opposite way his mom wants ... for now. A strange force will pull him back on the right path. That's what this movie is about ... that strange force.
@MellowRVA @jeff13164 I can't wait to roast that old bastard
Convo in my house:  "Honey, do you still light up like a firefly when you see me?"  "Yes. Now can you take out the garbage?"
George's mom is the one who says he should go see Mary. Why are moms so much smarter than all other humans?
George's dream comes true only in pamphlets and distant train whistles. He does not know his life is about to change.
True story: As Uncle Billy walked off camera a stage hand dropped some lights. The actor ad libbed the "I'm all right" line. Capra loved it, so he went back and made the crash sound even louder and kept it in the movie.
By design of course https://t.co/q2BZE8DsHG
Btw as a public service....I took my family to see Aquaman today. It was awful. Carry on.
George is a better man than I am in so many way. If it was me I would have thrown Harry under the next train. https://t.co/Nup6PbqWSM
George Bailey would never troll me. He would respectfully disagree and then invite me for a drink at Martini's. https://t.co/3mFj5OzJsy

Yes you did, Harry. You told Ruth you would take that job. You suck.
George holds down the fort while Harry goes to college, plays football and scores a hot wife, not to mention a great job. So he comes home and screws George. Jerk.
I'm starting to get pissed at Harry already. Snake.
Even Clarence knows he wouldn't go. George thinks God is not answering his prayers when in truth, God has bigger things in mind for him.
George is about to get out of Bedford Falls ... finally. But he has a choice to make. Does he do what's best for him, or for others?  If you don't know what he does, you don't know George.
I LOVE that close up shot of Mr. Potter. For the first time he realizes just how smart George is. Brilliant filmmaking, Mr. Capra.
People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man they're cattle.
He never once thought of himself.  Guess we know where George gets it.
George understands that if you invest in middle class opportunity it is good for business. Why don't more people understand that?
"He was a man of high ideals ... so called."  I will pray for you Mr. Potter you miserable SOB
I love this scene. George's monologue is intense. Get ready for your whuppin Mr. Potter.
Very true. This movie happens in the Depression and goes through WW2. Children dying from flu was a lot more prevalent, for example. https://t.co/09xZmJU4uI
13?? In the movie I think it's more like four. My wife is five years younger than I am. https://t.co/F6APxWDLKQ
The sad part is we never get to hear what George's "deal" was.
Just like that....George's world is totally shattered. We just never know when that is going to happen. We must treasure every moment of every day of our wonderful lives.
We're not quite into "Baby It's Cold Outside" territory here but we're kinda close.
This is a very interesting situation!
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death!!!!
George: "What do you want, Mary? You want the moon?"  You: "I like ur Tinder profile"  George &gt; You
Jimmy Stewart is tall and gangly and totally awkward. Yet women swoon and men get it.
George wants the world. Mary wants George. Who dreams bigger?
George knows what he's gonna do tomorrow and the next day and the next day ....  If you want to make God laugh, plan.
Oh goodness Donna in that bathrobe....
They fall into the water and George .... keeps dancing. Fellas, we've got no chance against this guy.
"They're cheering us. We must be good!"
First of all, yes, that's Alfalfa. Second, why does that random schmendrick have the key to the floor?
Fair point. I am duly chastened. https://t.co/A7Cu7tyzSF
This gym is at Beverly Hills High School. Who's gonna invite me up there?
Donna is making my knees weak
Oh why don't you stop annoying people  Well I'm sorry....heyyyyy
I hope someone just once will look at you and me the way Mary just looked at George. Looked him up and down too....
Every time Violet thinks she has a shot at George that damn Mary one-ups her.....
Hee Haw Sam Wainwright....we should remember that
how about Harry balancing those plates on his head! Kid is crazy... https://t.co/cXXuvXTxmK
Men long for Violets but we marry Marys.... https://t.co/4ymIPYEq7x
And George wasn't on his phone at the table either. Our rule in my family is no phones at the table, or often times not in the car. TALK!! https://t.co/qDjl7LG28T
Ask Dad. He knows. https://t.co/aWMD01Cp2y
Trying to get to all your mentions at the commercials. So glad to know this movie's message is getting out on Christmas Eve. Feels like we need it now more than ever.
Interesting how George just gets the idea to go to the dance after all. Does he know something is waiting for him there? Who is directing his steps?
"Pop, you want a shock? I think you're a great guy."  These are the last words George will say to his father. We should remember that next time we get a little annoyed with someone who loves us.
"You were born older, George."  Things only a dad would say.
Harry mentions the high school gymnasium has a new floor. I wonder what that's all about?
George thinks his dad looks tired. So sad.
Btw Sesame Street did not get Ernie and Bert from this movie. Just a coincidence.
We are all that guy who almost got hit by a car
Forgive me. It's a little hard to concentrate. I know we are going to see Donna Reed in that bathrobe soon.
When George learns Mr. Gower bought him the suitcase, he doesn't say, "Well he owes me." He is simply grateful.
It's a good face. I like him. I like George Bailey.
If you think about the genius of this movie....the roadmap is so meticulous. Each moment, each scene recurs later in the movie in an important way. It's like Capra is dropping little bread crumbs for us to follow through the dark woods.

Thanks for joining me. I'm already a little fahrklempt. https://t.co/3ZfHboMik4
Yet he doesn't realize it. He wants a million dollars, to explore the world and marry several women at once. He thinks he dreams big, I say he is thinking too small. That's the message of the movie. https://t.co/gSbh9yD9Lj
Interesting how we define "courage." George does these things out of habit not in search for glory. https://t.co/wfyVQV4B15
"I know you feel bad."
I learned today that that is real blood coming out of that kid's ear. The actor really hit him hard.
Even as Mr. Gower is slapping George around, George never gets angry with him. He knows how upset he is.
"They're not my children."  "Well they're somebody's children Mr. Potter."  Peter Bailey ladies and gentlemen.
Ask Dad. He knows.  True.  cc: @LannyDavis
George is only a boy but he already has the gift of empathy. He reads that telegram and knows exactly what Mr. Gower is feeling.
A couple of harems and maybe three or four wives....  George dreams big. Give the kid credit.
Is this the ear you can't hear in? George Bailey I'll love you til the day I die.
George wants to see the world. Mary only sees George. So who's the blind one?
I like him.  You like every boy.  What's wrong with that?
Mr. Potter is the richest man in town yet he is miserable to his core. What does George wish for? A million dollars. He has so much to learn.
George loses hearing in his right ear. We should remember that.
Of course George is first in the water to save his brother. George never thinks of himself first. His greatest virtue and, eventually, his undoing.
I like it https://t.co/RXJSIm4iaM
In early versions of the script George and Harry trespass on Mr. Potter's land, and as they run away Harry falls through the ice.
Why is Joseph so cranky?
Clarence is reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Maybe we should remember that. There are no insignificant details.
"Yes but he's got the faith of a child."  I hope someone says that about me someday. Why did we grow up?
Clarence is a clockmaker. Interesting detail never explained.
The movie starts with the sounds of people praying. That tells us this a movie about faith. Whom did you pray for today?
Frank Capra's....It's A Wonderful Life....
Liberty Films Presents...
One minute away....
@mrjlaws Wonderful!
My dad is actually volunteering to face time with me the whole movie so I can see the east coast airing. Told you we were crazy!
Btw I think I figured out how to watch the east coast feed from L.A. on YouTube TV. Feel free to give me any tips if I am wrong. If Otherwise I will live tweet the west coast airing. You can stay up with me and we can look out for Santa together.
Sentimental hogwash, Mr. Potter? Maybe so. But it is a wonderful movie. Tweet ya later everyone.
A few years ago I was watching the movie and started tweeting about it. The reaction was wonderful and organic. So now I live tweet it every year. Unlike Die Hard, this is now a Christmas tradition.
When I was growing up I watched this movie with my parents a lot. I loved each showing. Last week I took my wife and three sons to see it in our local movie theater. It still makes me cry.
Two years ago I interviewed Ms. Grimes on my now defunct podcast. It was a special moment for me. You can listen to it here. https://t.co/AOr5Frya1L
@amolyajnik I fear you're right but in the listings it says the movie will air on that stream at 5 pm. Cross your fingers for me.
Her first husband died in a hunting accident. Her son committed suicide. Her second husband died of cancer. She developed a later career as ambassador for the film after it became popular again.
Grimes’ life was not so wonderful. She was in several movies as a child actor but her parents died when she was 15. She moved to Missouri and was raised by family.
In 1974, Karolyn Grimes, who played Zuzu, was walking past a TV store and caught the movie out of the corner of her eye on all the screens. She recognized she was in the film but she had never seen it before.
The copyright owner won a case in 1993 to reclaim ownership of the movie. NBC purchased the exclusive long term rights the following year.
The movie would have been lost to obscurity but in 1974 the copyright owner neglected to file for an extension. That meant any TV station could air the movie for free. It aired countless times on multiple stations in every city. It became a Christmas classic.
The movie was released on Dec 20, 1946. Unlike Die Hard it is considered a “Christmas movie.” It did not perform well at the box office but it was nominated for five Academy Award including Best Picture.
The original ending had George falling to his knees and reciting the Lord’s prayer. Capra asked for a rewrite because he felt that was too religious.
The story was finally published by Good Housekeeping magazine under the title The Man Who Was Never Born. In the story when George disappears Mary ends up marrying someone else. Not so in the movie.
The story caught the eye of a movie producer at RKO Pictures who sent it to Cary Grant. He had interested in playing the lead role. Frank Capra later purchased the rights for $10k for his company, Liberty Films.
The movie is based on a short story named The Greatest Gift. The author, Philip Van Doren Stern, couldn’t get it published at first so he sent it to 200 friends as Christmas presents in 1943.
So we are less than an hour away from the annual Christmas Eve showing of the greatest movie ever made, It's A Wonderful Life. Some thoughts and tidbits on how this gem got made....
I will tweet it live as always but I'm sure I will repeat myself often. Especially the Sharpie at the end. https://t.co/nzMjPybzcz

Sagaba Konate was out with an injury but still ... West Va holds on to beat Jacksonville State 74-72. At home.
Quinerly looks comfortable in his most meaningful minutes of the season. Just needs to keep things simple and make the easy plays.
Nova on an 11-0 run. Is Piccolo Girl watching?

Jay Wright gonna try to win this game with five guys? UConn and Nova tied at 18 under 8 time out first half on CBS.
Collin Gillespie won't play today for Villanova because of a concussion.  Does that mean there will be a Jahvon Quinerly sighting at the Garden today?

@JeffZimm watching it live speed it looked like a clear charge. Defender was in position. Replays shows there wasn't much contact. At worst it was a close call. FAR from awful.

Last point about Zion: It is incorrect to put a qualifier before the word "unique." Unique means one of a kind. You can't be so unique, or very unique, or the most unique. You are unique, or you are not. Good night America.

@rex_rexchapman All I want for Chanukah is to see you ref a college game. And I want to call it!
From the replays I saw....in line action it looked like a good call. When slowed down (especially on angle from behind) it looked like a bad call. Unfortunately refs don’t get to slow down and evaluate frame by frame.
Was unable to watch the Duke-Texas Tech game tonight (about to watch on my laptop) but instructive and sadly unsurprising that the Zion charge call dominated the Twitter convo. Are refs the only people on the planet not allowed to make mistakes?

Alright my pretties it is Sunday night again, and so it is time to feed the trolls. Come out from under your bridges and be ready to feast on my weekly AP ballot...
Troll feeding will go down for real at 8:30 pm ET. Plan accordingly you smelly, hairy, pathetic bridge dwellers.
Was on a flight during the Tennessee-Gonzaga game so will catch up with the video a little later. But just saw the box score. Man oh man Josh Perkins....

Yale hanging tough so far in Cameron. Trails Duke 24-22 under 8 mins to play first half.
Western Kentucky up 2 at Arkansas 3:15 to play
Georgetown up 63-62 in the Carrier Dome with 5 mins to play. Gonna be a fun finish. Old school.
Tyus Battle doing Tyus Battle things
Indiana being very generous today with all these missed free throws. Tis the season for giving.
Another huge three for Phinisee puts Indiana up 60-58 with 1:18 to play.
Georgetown up 13 at Syracuse final minute first half.
Illinois escapes with a 77-74 win over UNLV at home
Jordan Nwora is singlehandedly keeping Louisville in this game. He has 24 pts and 11 rebs, Cards lead Indiana by 1 with under 4 mins to play
clearly a flagrant 1 https://t.co/QDHR2CV0hf
Louisville is playing hard on defense but at some point the Cards have got to score. Indiana just took its first lead of the game on a Phinisee three.

If Willard hadn't lost all his hair it would be gone after that. Wow. Free hoops at the Garden.
Yeah but Kevin Willard put a defender on the ball. I thought that was supposed to be an automatic win????
KELDON JOHNSON HALFCOURT SHOT FOR KENTUCKY!!!! TO OT WE GO!!!!
By the way just cause the ball went in doesn't make it a good shot or a good possession. It was neither.
Myles Powell!!! Tough double clutch three pointer! Hall leads by 3 with 1.1 secs to play. He has 22 second half points.
Powell nailed his three pointer and Herro missed his. That's these two teams in a nutshell. Seton Hall and Kentucky tied at 67 with 24.1 seconds to play on Fox.
They called it a personal foul, no flagrant. I think they missed it.
That's not a basketball play. He extended his elbow and it hit Washington in the throat. Gotta be a flagrant 1.
That could be a flagrant 1 on Rhoden. Gonna be close.
Myles Powell three ties it up. A minute to go at MSG. Gus on the call.
PJ Washington now has 22 and 10 for Kentucky. Cats have needed every bit of it. Lead by 4 with 2:20 to go.
It wasn't pretty but the Spartans will take the 63-59 win.
Yup. He beat it. Spartans up 4.
Huge dunk by Ahrens but not sure he beat the shot clock. Huge replay coming up here.
Florida down two to Michigan State with the ball and a minute to go. Get to CBS.
Wow Northwestern on a 19-0 run. That'll win you some games.
Seton Hall up 2 on Kentucky with 12 minutes to play at MSG.
DePaul has been winning big at Northwestern most or the game but Cats are now within 2 with 5:30 to play.
Xavier Tillman having a nice afternoon for the Spartans. They can't quite put Florida away. Michigan St up 50-44 with 7:21 to play on CBS.
Kentucky and Seton Hall went 10 minutes without either team making a basket. Good times.
Michigan State already has 9 turnovers with 4:30 left in the first half. That's now how you get Capone.
One of these four guys is gonna to win the Heisman tonight. https://t.co/RzTXWDOWS6

If you are guarding the dribbler you can move your feet and take a charge. It’s the secondary defender that has to be stationary. https://t.co/xT8wPK27dq
Pitt had two good looks but couldn’t convert. Iowa escapes by one. These Panthers are dramatically improved from last season.
Wisconsin finished off the comeback. Impressive.
I love the Pitt strength coach running onto the court to separate the players. Should be part of the job description for all strength coaches.
Fifth charge of the night for Davison.
Superb job by Brad Davison drawing his fourth charge of the night. Badgers up 3 on NC State in final minute.
