@EBIII @CasualHoya @TylerAdams0 @unclejeffgreen I hear u on that. But it's the same thing in the @nba when I first got to Indy. No one came to the games. We were like three years removed from the brawl. Once we started to win. Bankers Life was rocking. Players. I mean student athlete's need to worry about winning first
@TylerAdams0 Takes time boss. When I was a freshman with @unclejeffgreen no one was at the game. We started winning and beating top 25 teams. Then it will come back. I believe it will come back
@StephenAmell Same

Random thought here but if any of you have children feel free to chime in. If I'm wrong I'm sure you will let me know. But I don't fuck with the book "The Giving Tree". I just think it sends a horrible message to kids to take take take and not think about who you are taking from.
@chelseaperetti Congrats lil sis.

@thesavage125 @TheMoto_Nick They have no scoring. Idk
@thesavage125 That's what's up. Family time is the best. I think u can't count the Cavs out cause of LeBron. I think they are a good team. But alot of the guys defer to LeBron. He has to throw up threes from deep at the end of the shot clock. If k love isn't hitting and LeBron isn't

@50cent Dinner on me when I come nyc.
@verge Why does it suck? Aren't people moving towards wireless anyway. And doesn't the lack of headphones jack give the manufacturer the ability to put in a bigger battery to compensate for bigger screens? I could be wrong.
