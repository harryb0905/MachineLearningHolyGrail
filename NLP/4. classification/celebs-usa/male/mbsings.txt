@ScHEy Yes we all have a responsibility
@Amphybrach No dispute there either. The wisdom is continuing to fight for principles in spite of all the challenge
@ScHEy Sadly that may be true but those coming forward are tipping the scale and we all can do our part to maintain zero tolerance
@kimikomcc We are gonna call it Rise! And yes we will release it...just not quite yet!
@MattMasielloMD Help and Education is absolutely needed but any kind of bullying behavior must be shut down.
@Amphybrach Sexual abuse is an abuse of power
@rosa_schalkwyk I’m so sorry for what u went through but admire u deeply for standing up for yourself - and others.
We must all maintain a position of ZERO tolerance to any form of sexual harassment or abuse of any kind - in the workplace or anywhere.
@edwardistheman @FreshOffABC lol
My heart &amp; prayers go to those who lost their lives, were injured, their loved ones -all victims of a senseless, horrific &amp; cowardly act. 💛
@ecozh5 Yes I am! Back home and seeing my family. So nice
@IlariaDiva Happy belated!!
