.@stephestellar slice zucchini thin. saute in oil. toss with mint, raw egg (like 1 per 2 servings), parm. so great. #bittmantopics

.@alec510 That's a simple "yes." #BittmanTopics
.@HavenBourque Totally."dog pee is water soluble." And so far, no evidence of serious chemical contaminants in foraged food. #BittmanTopics
.@JWUCulinaryNow No. But certainly more would be better ... and 'regional' I think, is a more apt word than 'local.' #BittmanTopics

Reiterate: Everyone living in the US has the right to fair, green, healthy, affordable food. #NFPTALK

Oh man this is bad: In Eric Garner Chokehold Case, Grand Jury Is Said Not to Charge N.Y.P.D. Officer http://t.co/LLdYUHUDw1
A8.Local food policies are going to happen way before an NFP. They ARE happening. #NFPTALK
A7. We ask them! But farmers and f.w.s need to make a living growing FOOD. A NFP would prioritize that. #NFPTALK
So nice to sum up years of thought &amp; writing in a series of haikus! #NFPTALK
A6. I see it as part of the same struggle. You can’t make big changes in food w/o making big changes in many other things. #NFPTALK
A5. Let’s help farmers grow good food with minimal damage, and let’s make sure people can buy it. #NFPTALK
A4. Also: We are not getting a NFP without a real food movement. At that point we’ll be stronger in countering Big Ag etc. #NFPTALK
a3. Too late on this Farm Bill but it would guide the next. #NFPTALK
But let’s not kid ourselves …we have to get some serious traction before we can talk about that. #NFPTALK
A ‘czar’ with some clout would be ideal. Or an amalgam of the best parts of FDA and USDA. Or a new dep't.#NFPTALK
a1. As Michael says: you articulate it so you can act like it's real. We have zippo like that now. #NFPTALK
a1. It could be as simple as, “Everyone living in the US has the right to fair, green, healthy, affordable food.” #NFPTALK

@nickgould #bittmanchat NO! Drain and rinse! Stuff is gross. (Or cook from scratch, obviously preferable. Cooked beans freeze great.)

RT @egratto: I have the same issue -- if I don't eat a lot of protein, I'm STARVED. #VB6. I'll bet it's fat that fills you up not pro.
RT @kathyf: @bittman @wgbh Cows' milk has sugar in it too. #vb6 Then one has to specify ADDED sugar to be clear?
RT @mary_lanaux:  Why vegan before 6 rather than just vegetarian? #vb6. I wanted to reduce calories &amp; carbon footprint.
RT @ASKn4trbl: @bittman #VB6 How do 50-something aged women get enough calcium? http://t.co/oNpdnj8G1A
RT @samuelhorowitz: thoughts on minimally processed bars (Lara Bar/Kind/etc?) do they work for before 6? #vb6 fresh fruit is better
RT @smalera: Thought it was "vodka before 6." (Bourbon after?) RT @SamSifton: Love eating all this veal before 6. #VB6
RT @uprootfromOR: Is there a preference for soy, almond, coconut (etc) milk? #VB6 fewer ingredients is better
mT @melissalion: Soy products are very processed; recommendation for less processed products? #vb6 whole foods, note the lower case
RT @sarahfinley: LOVE the #VB6 concept, hope it takes off, @bittman! I've stayed healthy/same size for decades using similar practices.
RT @allievmacd: I'm curious about cheese - do you bother with the vegan versions, or just use cheese after six? #VB6 REAL dairy, after 6
#vb6 processed = mostly white. try for whole grains during the day. pasta is sort of an exception but I usually avoid it until dinner
RT @wisekaren: How strict are you about "processed"? What about, say, purchased bread, cereal, crackers, pasta, etc.? #vb6 see next tweet
RT @EditorVegTimes: @GinaMartineLA Read the book--it's all about real food, the exact opposite of processed foods. #VB6
RT @jackie_liu5: @bittman Do you exercise as well? #VB6 I'm a runner.
RT @nancyheiser: @bittman Your gut reaction (literal) to yr big change in diet? GI track issues?  #Vb6 none
RT @SamSifton: Love eating all this veal before 6. #VB6 &lt;- Key ingredient. Vegan + veal.
RT @wgbh: soy milk etc is just icky and filled with sugar. &lt;- there is unsweetened soy milk you know. #vb6
RT @standupdan: how does drinking factor into #vb6? Alcohol is a treat, essentially.
RT @GinaMartineLA:  #VB6 good intentions, but promotes too many carbs &amp; vegan processed food. &lt;- actually not.

RT @DrMarkLeder: #VB6 how do you sneak those healthful omega 3's in? &lt;- Fish, nuts, beans, oils.

RT @VeganLunchClub: @LiveBetterDC @bittman It's all about feeling better in the end, isn't it? #VB6 yeh
@livebetterdc #vb6. tough question. I think if you were to eliminate only 1 thing from your diet it should be junk.
RT @LiveBetterDC: how much of your weight loss is the vegan part of vs no treats/processed food/alcohol before 6:00?#vb6 Hard to say.

mT .@EgoServare: All seems doable, except lunch at the office. It's the biggest hurdle. #vb6 &lt;- no question but you can do it. I do.
mT .@MDeliciousKarma: Yogurt in a different bucket vs. other dairy? #VB6 &lt;- It is and it isn't. But if you need it, cut back elsewhere.
RT @ericagelbard: why eat your biggest meal at night vs. first thing in the morning? #VB6 Because I want to have fun at night.
