@nealrogers 👌🏼 got it. Good points there. As I sit here in turkey i can’t help but think the teams and sponsors would be much better served at some of these more progressive events🙄
@nealrogers I think what EF is doing is brilliant and hope they succeed because that’s the path I also want to be taking. But there is a huge difference between adding some new bananas roads to a one day euro classic and sticking a rider in a race like Leadville or dirty K IMO!
@nealrogers So far off with that one
This year's transfer season proved to be a little different for me than the past 10+ years.  My most recent blog for @velonews is now live and walks through the dynamics that play into staying or going and various other thoughts around transfer season.  https://t.co/JqtiLvyK0F

Stage 10 at @LaVuelta was a good way to transition out of the rest day. With a bunch sprint anticipated, most of us kept yesterday short &amp; easy, but you risk the body shutting down after going full gas for 9 days.  My report: https://t.co/CrKtXWQfQU  📷@ChrisAuldPhoto #LaVuelta18 https://t.co/S1PD558Lc3
Monday was a welcomed rest day after a grueling first “week” here at @LaVuelta. They call the block from the start to the rest day the ‘first week,’ but it’s actually 9 days!    Here's how I spent the first rest day: https://t.co/s0FRz8ot6C  #LaVuelta18 #LaVuelta https://t.co/BByW9mfzB9
Stage 8 at @LaVuelta saw us moving across Spain &amp; closer to the next stages. We did an hour on the bus, 5 hours on the bike &amp; then 2.5 hours in the cars post race.   Biggest thing to note: it was ridiculously HOT. My report: https://t.co/LnJ9ocqnjl  📷@ChrisAuldPhoto #LaVuelta18 https://t.co/wVzh9UyHaR
Stage 7 of @LaVuelta felt a little bit like a 1-day race, not day 7 &amp; 33 racing hours into a GT.

Without a sprinter &amp; seeing @BMCProTeam's GC possibilities cut back, it was important to keep Nico in the mix at @lavuelta today.

Another victim of the finish-line scrum that is bike racing. Sad to see our buddy Yuri headed home after a race org car ran over his foot at yesterday’s finish @lavuelta. Maybe time to rethink this area of the race? 🤔 https://t.co/J3c7YSj8XS
There weren't any flat roads on today's 'flat stage.' It's a matter of perspective, but it didn’t feel like a sprinter’s stage but once we hit the 3rd week of @lavuelta, today will seem ‘cruise-y’.

Gutted for @tejay_van and all who put so much into his amazing ride up to now! Cruel, savage, merciless sport. Perspective on what #TDF is.

@Mickeyhavoc pass the guac my way please
@thearamD both legs?
@CrikeyCadel thanks Crikey!  Keep croc rockin for us!
@giveitaburl nice attention to detail! Trying out a new color.
@LechnerTravis @MatthewBusche @bookwalterbinge we hope to see u there too! You missed a fun one last year. It will be even better w riding!
It's not the madness of the #TD2015 but you can catch some coverage of the @BMCProTeam crew @TourOfAustria here..http://t.co/ex8qm8UBK4
@CaleyFretz great description. key words.."old school crisis management"
@peterstetina we raced through those at flèche wallone also this year. Asked if they would be removed for TDF and the answer was a NO! BS!
@jeredgruber and by final you mean the last 120 km of the stage?
Curious, What percentage of #TD2015 audience appreciates the mayhem on a stage like today? I agree it's exciting, but is it lost on most?
@sweide thanks Sean! Looking good back there! Glad you snagged some pool time for us
Poor planning/execution of TTT @TourOfAustria. 2 min start intervals. Too few Officials + no jig at bike check. @petervelits missed start!
@CrikeyCadel love back to you and the gang down under. Thanks!
Ever see a 50 year old man + women throw a tantrum at boarding gate and take all their clothes off in protest? I have! #sillyseason #nopics
Whoever said that pro cyclists who don't race the TDF in July go on vacation was full of 💩💩💩. 9 stages @TourOfAustria coming up.
@drewmac28 @ANAPRC_ @cpacycling I completely agree. A strong, professionally ran union is key in facilitating this. Like other pro sports.
Important topic but no mention of the org. @CPAcycling who is charged w/ protecting riders?! #educate #accountability http://t.co/77xPcq5OgR
Disappointed to miss cut for @letour. All was lining up nicely. Can't say I fully understand the how/why but will b rooting for @BMCProTeam!
@EuroHoody yes! Nothing against the Netherlands but isn't the Grand Partenza/Depart there getting a little overdone!?
It wasn't always warm but the views were always amazing. Great training trip in the Dolomites! https://t.co/HWHPlHLLzL
@aldentanaka nice to meet you! Glad u enjoyed Girona and had a few laughs with Jamie. Guaranteed more @bookwalterbinge. Hope 2 C you there!

Huge shame that fans miss first 150 km of a stage like 2day @dauphine. No way to describe the complex chaos that leads to current situation
Yes, I'm still a slow walker/hiker... But all the better for taking in the view https://t.co/hyPfxtIpEk
@Ty_Magner watch the usage of "stout riders" I don't doubt these performances qualified but gotta keep the value of the word up.
@anitabfranklin yes 3 giro. 3 TDF and 1 Vuelta. That's about 7 more grand tours then I expected to do when I started bike racing.
Happy, proud and relieved to finish another "once in a lifetime experience" at #giro w @BMCProTeam. Amazing what the body and mind can do!
@marcopinotti @craiglewis85 the 4th week can have stages all between 250-300 km. 3000-6000 meters of climbing. #whynot?
I hope it was fun watching the top 5 on 2days stage. death march for everyone else! Maybe next time they do 300 km and the rest 200? #redonk
@Mickeyhavoc 1 blueberry? That will be 7 euros, please.
I will say that when we were "above ground" today the area was impressive! #4togo #giro
Call me a whimp, but racing through DARK tunnels full speed w 200 riders is scary! Can we get more lights please @giroditalia @cpacycling
@anitabfranklin sadly another fruitless one!  Thanks for cheering!
@BMCProTeam @ShimanoROAD actually it was a 11-32 with 53/39 chain rings.
Beauty of a setting for giroditalia rest day in Pinzolo. Body, mind and soul recovery. https://t.co/p1f1hPmUsG
@BGreene1 @jamiebookwalter aww we miss you and all of the @DivasTourFrance ladies!  Loved the chalk art!
Good luck to compatriot guys and gals racing @usacycling #USPRO TT today in  my former hometown, Chattanooga. My #Giro TT..Long,wet,conserve
@craiglewis85 @rorysutherland1 @timjohnsoncx giro stage in Bari last war neutralized GC time early. Sprinters crashed brains out. GC safe.
@craiglewis85 @rorysutherland1 @timjohnsoncx that's a possible outcome. I'm not saying it's an answer, just it should be discussed, together
@tomdanielson @cpacycling @ANAPRC_ speak up and get involved. We need to use the channels in place
If the riders believe a 5 or 10 km GC time rule would be positive 4 safety + spirit of sport WE need to speak up @cpacycling @ANAPRC_
Yes! "@grahamwatson10: Philippe Gilbert wins stage 12 of the Giro d'Italia..! http://t.co/KIIbJUOcC5”

@BrianFalotico @patlemieux thanks guys! Always nice to feel support from back home
It took planning, perseverance and commitment but @elpumaDarwin and I did it! Last ones @BMCProTeam to wake up on the #giro rest day
@marcopinotti also impressive but doesn't count if your italian because you are at "home" all month!
Congrats @amaelmoinard on another gutsy ride! How many other guys who got called into the @giroditalia 2 days before are gaming this hard!?
@CaleyFretz don't forget the 75 before and 350 after just to firmly establish the giro #kickintheballs score
Thanks @giroditalia for letting us experience Italy's finest hotels from the 1920's and premiere italian blends of mold. #junkshow #pro?

@Mickeyhavoc only one of them is walking?! Just any ole stage in the Basque Country
@larrywarbasse your starting to sound like @thachad
@Laura_Weislo @inrng why can't Race orgs and @UCI_cycling fairly balance safety of athletes with their liability, like other pro sports?
Great recap from @inrng about stage 1 fiasco at #itzulia http://t.co/0fHkk4RJhu. Still no statement from @UCI_cycling or race organizer here
@jessesergent DM me or @ANAPRC_ if we can help here.
@jessesergent glad to hear! Let's not forget these entirely avoidable accidents and force @cpacycling and @UCI_cycling to take care of us
@cycling_jsg correct, 5 mins is way too little 4 that gross negligence. races need riders but riders also need races. #Collaborate4progress
The riders must be the ones to hold @cpacycling accountable!"@laurenstendam: Something for CPA! @UCI_cycling  https://t.co/QAd8w5DE9T”
@ScottTedro agree 100%. We are trying. We = a small group. Difficult to rally/convince a population w/ a huge tradition in apathy.
Whoops, cancel my last tweet! "@VelonCC: We've signed a deal with Flanders, we'll have cameras on bikes &amp; all 11 teams racing at Flanders
What happened to the idea of "on rider/bike cameras"?! So much of a races intensity, energy, battling, nervousness is lost in far away shots
Yelling at TV! Already 2 riders severely injured by incompetent driving of neutral support cars at Flanders. Consequences? #dontforget
@sweide the name speaks for itself and its reputation says the rest! #nogimmicks

@EuroHoody wait a minute there... It's an RCS race so I'm betting the busses are at least 5 km from the finish.
Tomorrow another bike race @TirrenAdriatico finishing at a ski-area with skiing weather forecasted. snow + bikes =???
Nice to meet @Salvato_pres here @TirrenAdriatico today. Thank you for being here for @cpacycling and for the riders!

A couple days in Girona before joining #TeamUSA at Worlds. What kind of swag should I bring back for the @bookwalterbinge crew???
only been out of #ASHEVILLE for a couple hours but already craving a burrito from #Mamacitas Mexican grill.  Come get yours @bookwalterbinge
En route to Spain and got awesome news @BMCProTeam is world champions in the TTT! Persistence pays!   Staff, riders, sponsors.. Congrats!
Support kids with cancer via @curesearch and have a chance to win a jersey signed by BMC's world champions...http://t.co/vZN8pDK7QK
Congrats to an influential (former) team mate, and friend @louderjeff on an accomplished &amp; fruitful career. Great memories racing with you!
YES! @thejpmurph USA criterium champion! yea buddy!!!
Honoured to be selected as part of a powerful and talented #TeamUSA for @Ponferrada2014 #Worlds! Thanks for the well wishes!
You know your old when u are the guy who shows up to concert at "doors open" to be sure you snag a bar stool. Old, still in season. Or both
@lawsoncraddock ruthless is a kind and understated way to put it. Nice work young Lawson
Still buzzin from last week... "@fi_sonic: @BMCProTeam celebrtes on podium @USAProChallenge #BestTeam http://t.co/EUzO9d4RWO”
@BijuTheChef that one was a low blow! Cruel!
One thing is CLEAR... The CPA, AIGCP, AIOCC, and UCI must create a new protocol for Stage Neutralization/Cancellation/Modification.
@BenKing89 lets finally do something about it
Again our livelihood &amp; hard work affected by incompetence of officials. chief comm should be sent home NOW! #prochallenge @USAProChallenge
Another day with our livelihood and hard work affected by the incompetence of race officials. This chief comm should be sent home, NOW!
Finally penalties for ridiculous behaviour "@BMCProTeam: #EnecoTour: @PhilippeGilbert up to 7th overall after time penalty 4 Niki Terpstra"
Happy birthday to @TrudiLR! Very thankful to have such a kind person and experienced professional on our team an in our lives. Cheers Trudi!
@MBurghardt83 @BMCProTeam looks smaller than I remember. Spread out and make yourself comfortable.
@lostincosmos couldn't get my legs to shut up.  Maybe send me your contact info and you can give me a few bike racing lessons?
Adding sign language, heiroglyphs &amp; 1st grade scribble to my list of languages to learn b4 next years @TourOfUtah #Commisairetalk #timeboard
Congrats to my #tou14 roomie @hermansben on stepping up with a stout ride today!
So happy for @michaelschaer! Such a selfless teammate for so many races and an even nicer guy all around. Good things happening to good ppl!
If your looking for a fun event to cap off your summer of riding check out @Dirty40Race... Awesome course and even better community spirit
@nealrogers WTF!?!  I'm glad someone is looking out for me. Can we get a redo on that one please?
Looked like a beefy day at the #TDF. Guys gotta be on fumes. In more exciting news..Jamie ran into Owen Wilson at farmers mkt in #asheville!
Psyched! "@sweide: Just booked my trip to @bookwalterbinge. Promises to be a nice event &amp; for a good cause. Details: http://t.co/EVuOA14q6x”
@sitdowninfront @BMCProTeam awesome to hear you have the jersey! Thanks so much for your help with @bookwalterbinge and @TripsForKidsWNC

Case in point..."@skipmcne: @Cyclocosm @brentbookwalter How is the TDF harder to get than NASCAR Cup racing?”
Cheering for @amaelmoinard! My roomie during TDF2011 and personal favourite frenchie. He doesn't like A/C but awesome guy! Allez Amael!
@__JStewart they probably had to take it off the plane to spare weight for my seat buddy
If cycling was as easy to understand as ball-sports, It would be impossible for people to not be enthralled with days like today at the #TDF
Congratulations sir. You will be sitting next to the largest man to ever fly on an airplane. #lucky
Vienna-Amsterdam-Atlanta-Asheville. Long day, but nothing compared to the bonkers stage at the #TDF. Rest day for all tomorrow!

Shout out to my team mates @Seb_Lander and @larrywarbasse for stout rides @TourOfAustria today. May not show in results but taking steps up!
@TheDPate that would be WAY too predictable and controlled for the #TDF. Not to mention all the protective gear... Very un-TDF.
@AshevilleonBike @AVLChamber I will be there in spirit! I'm over in Austria at the moment, working. will be back to my fave city next week!
Anyone in the #Asheville area should check out @AshevilleonBike FUN and casual ride today, rolling from @AVLChamber at 6 pm. #bikeyourcity
Through the halfway point @TourOfAustria. Most notable stat so far.. I've survived all 4 stages with only 1 pair of underwear. #theotherrace
@craiglewis85 but it shows that he is so so BRAVE as courageous!
Suitcase saga day 3. No bag. No word from @Jet2_Tweets on where it could be?! Anyone in Manchester able to start a search &amp; rescue mission?
"Fell" victim to another game of square peg/round hole by my wonderful peers at @TourOfAustria. Minus some skin and busted bike, But OK
Thanks again @Jet2_Tweets for losing or maybe stealing my bag on that DIRECT flight. No info or news from anyone. Customer service? #Fail
@Jet2_Tweets how the heck do you lose a suitcase on a direct flight from Manchester to Vienna?!?  That is incredible.
5 straight days of airports, a false call up to the TDF, now http://t.co/bSigQBCwEX loses my suitcase between Manchester and Vienna. #value
Happy 4th of July USA! celebrating with a quick, 1 night trip to Leeds &amp; another flight to Vienna. Pass the beer, hot dogs &amp; fireworks plz
More than a few people out there with pre-TDF ulcers and grey hair this year. #highalert #lifeasfirstreserve

What happened to the classic size 12 oz. cans of coca-cola?!? As much as I love the stuff on a hot ride, I don't need the 16 oz MEGA version
@BrianFalotico I'm liking that paint job. Enjoy the ride!
@mbibbey thanks for helping us spread the word on the rides anyway. Good luck with the cx races!
@HeleneBarrette @mbibbey @pelotonmagazine @iamtedking fortunately everyone has the chance! @KingChallenge and @bookwalterbinge come see us!
Good luck @andyapplegate who is aiming for record pace riding the full 470 miles of @blueridgeparkwy today! My favourite road out there.
Congrats @PhilippeGilbert and @BMCProTeam on the WIN @SterZLMtoer!

@chsdawg thank you!!
@JoeCwn thanks! Awesome to have support from home!
@sitdowninfront thanks for the support the past few weeks and always, through thick and thin!
@Mickeyhavoc thanks mike!
@USACyclingU23 thanks for opportunity to travel down this path
@anitabfranklin thanks. Yes, Visions of hometown chalking in my head!
Grateful to have the chance to empty the tank on the final big mtn day of a roller coaster #giro. Thanks to everyone who kept me going!
@sitdowninfront @kimcando thanks for supporting us!!
@MichaelCarcaise I completely agree, but when I look around and see the diversity in mindset, motives, culture, morals, goals...how?
Today at the #giro we raced as if the shenanigans of yesterday didn't happen. I'm all for moving onward but fear there is no hope for change
Channeling some @taylorphinney perspective and inspiration today. No mater how absurd this #giro gets I know he would trade in a second.
Today is a good time to ask...Who are the actual people involved with in-race decisions? Qualification, character, motives, psych profile!?
@PodiumCafe "mess" actually describes it nicely
Searching for words... Frozen, Pain, frustration, thankful, fear, anger, insane, perplexed...I hope those watching enjoyed. #giro
Wise man says, and also lives... Just because you "can" doesn't mean you "should". #giro @giroditalia #logic #safety
Thanks ladies! "@DivasTourFrance: Missing our boy. Cc: @brentbookwalter http://t.co/Q60BWkz54P”
A little bummed to be missing friends/family in Chattanooga for #uspro but great to wake up and hear @taylorphinney is #redwhite&amp;blue in TT!
@timjohnsoncx of course my @BMCProTeam team mates. But I'm thinking @Ty_Magner, @joeyrosskopf and the @HincapieDevo boys will roll as well
@timjohnsoncx who are your picks?
@craiglewis85 glad to see retirement from the sport can be rainbows, sunshine, tailwinds, unicorns and swimming pools.
Last week it was @portugaltheman @ThePeel and now @AVLBeerWeek. The #giro is terribly timed for #asheville happenings. @828isgreat
@Bjones423 ha! Thanks for the pic! That one put a smile on my face
Relieved &amp; thankful to be safe after 2day but sad and frustrated for those who are hurt. Is there no way to avoid such carnage? I don't know
Can I come? "@ghincapie: Looking forward to this ride from @blackberryfrm to @ TheSwagInn to @hoteldomestique. http://t.co/ULFn86bxoS”
A rare moment of collective unity amongst the peloton at the #giro today. All the fans seemed excited as ever. #togetherisbetter
@rorysutherland1 but how many times have you been on the "away trainer" this year?
Experienced a new level of hotel stupidity last night... in-room motion detector lighting. #holdstill #NOmidnightpeeingplease #giro
3 days, 2 crashes, 2 smacked knees.  Clearly I do not have this "luck" that the Irish speak of. http://t.co/ik790ZIDqP
Less than ideal start to my day here but I am OK. Thanks for the concern. No thanks for the picture posts without accurate info.
@PhilippeGilbert new team rule... No yoga or power breathe during "selfies" or you feed the pig 20 euro.
@AVLChamber cool shirts! I have a little ride through Italy to finish first but hope to make some of the rides this summer!
My first day in Ireland was a wet one, but on a positive note, I speak the language and they have big beds! Is this a grand tour!?!? #giro
WOW! Luck of the Scottish "@BikeBreaks: Scottish Tuesday!!  Only today 2 for 1 on registrations for #GironaGranFondo for Scots. GUID LUCK!”
@ria1942 it's an honour. Thanks for the support!
Proud to be 1 of 2! "@PeterAbraham: 198 riders in the @giroditalia, and only two Americans: @brentbookwalter and Tyler Farrar."
@AlexxxWiki I would have loved to have been riding in that area yesterday, but no that couldn't have been me.
@thearamD flax...Soy... BLUBERRIES.
Great to hear @USACcollegiate cycling is alive and well in #Richmond this weekend. Some of my best cycling memories are from collegiate nats
Psyched to be heading back to the @giroditalia w/ @BMCProTeam.  Amazing to think all that has happened since my first time there in 2010.
@A_Gaillard Happy to answer a couple questions.  Please contact @sweide and he can help set it up.
Using 100% of oneself for a goal that's bigger than oneself.. the beauty of cycling.  materialising that into a WIN.. the joy of cycling
Nothing better than winning as a TEAM. Riders, staff, materials all coming together on the day. Bonus hometown race leader @Daniel87Oss!!

@Mattiemoe whoa throwback magazine! Thanks for the good words. I am also looking forward to getting back in the action. Hi to #asheville
3 weeks of nursing a bum knee goes a long way to up the motivation and appreciation for the bike. Glad to be back at it, chipping away.
DISAPPOINTED to miss the racing in Italy this weekend and next week with @bmcproteam. Knee still hasn't recovered from crash 2 weekends ago.
Bummed to miss it “@AshevilleonBike: Bike of the Irish is a strong representation of #avlbike community. #avlnews http://t.co/mXMqWOt6al”
Brilliant! And a cool name. “@WhiffAway: @brentbookwalter Currently successfully used at Heathrow Airport.”
Hit the pavement today. A couple small sheets and one big chunk of flesh left behind. Aside from the obvious sore spots, I'm ok.
7 months since was I was in a French, bike race-related hotel room. 7 oh so comfortable and convenient months. Here we are again. #business

A huge pleasure and honour to be part of @BMCProTeam and today's gutsy win by @CadelOfficial. Easy to see why it's Cadel-mania here in OZ!
@andrewtalansky how about the media who continue to give this guy a voice and the power to continue harming the sport?
Officially "back at it". Riders, staff and gear all on point @BMCProTeam. Enjoyed the welcoming Aussies out there today @tourdownunder
@ncenginerd @peterstetina @racedots sounds like they could use a few pro riders to get the word out and test
Finally! Now we can race. http://t.co/4DolsJbc52
@LisaBusche jealous on multiple levels of that one. Glad you two are both in good hands with @MatthewBusche and myself so far away. Cusoon.

2nd full day down under. No kuala sitings yet, 1 kangaroo but it was road kill. Psyched to be in a far away place where ppl speak English!

@BenKing89  hwell I would say @jamiebookwalter is good at breaking the silence but it will likely still be awkward.
I'm not sure who wins the hangover contest from yesterday... Me or the fans still stumbling on side of the road.

A windy day @letour for wearing down the mind, tiring the legs and stretching the bladder. Hard to do a nature stop when it's always 50k/hr!
Wow It worked!!! It's back!!!
Lots of Castles, baguettes and bike racing in this country. Now how about some functional cell towers and Internet? Please.
Already hearing reports of massive crowds for the TT today. Will be something to race to the doors of the DisneyWorld castle. #americankid
Most complicated path between 2 points in france? A #TDF stage. Felt like we hit all the random towns today. But they were happy to see us!
@conniespecht #true
Rest day... After yesterday's whirlwind I am not even sure which body of water we are at, but I'll take it http://t.co/m9RxMwbUcu
Traded bikes with Cadel after the first climb... Turns out a 51cm and 55cm frame are quite a bit different!!! That one left a mark.
My pre race tweet prediction was spot on. MAYHEM 2day. Such a shame the first 50 km are not televised. If no one sees it, did it even happen
Gnar gnar day @letour. 2+ hrs in bus, 5 mega mtns to climb, more bus, another flight in plane and even more bus! #ourpetsheadsarefallingoff
@_Gavia_ good point. We will just be coasting and having casual conversation for the first few hours. Nothing to note at all.
@LMCBobcats thanks guys! But you know my overall place is not an objective. All for one, one for all here. #teamwork
Where I come from there are 7 days in a week. So officially, we are 1 week down, 2 to go. Sending healing vibes to @michaelschaer #warrior
@VincentMGee I'm thinking a solid IPA would be best case scenario. But would settle for a Leffe. You coming?
Happy 4th of July! To celebrate I battled in the HEAT and wind with 200 of my best buddies. Rain check on the beers and burgers. And buddies
Not our best day with 3 guys on the ground at 3 separate times. I hit hard with 15 km to go but nothing serious. Michi and Tejay ok too.
@thek2 I agree. They want high drama, they want the peloton blown to pieces, everyone says the suffering is the beauty.
The fight for position begins way before the start of the race at the #tdf http://t.co/9nVWYZbMTy
@caroseberryenh @iamtedking @UCI_cycling @letour I would be on board for that!  Sadly, solidarity is not our collective strong point
Feeling for @iamtedking! it just feels so wrong, doesn't it? @UCI_cycling @letour
A bus, a plane, multiple boats, a bus and now traffic anarchy in a car, all to get to the start of today's TTT.  Excited for the BIKE part!
Ok France, I am trying hard to love you but your lack of shower curtains is blowing my mind. Why?
tense day @letour? when u are losing skin from ur hands being jammed up under the saddle of guy in front of u, yep http://t.co/bl3Nrtr25g
5th and final morning in Corsica. Wouldn't mind returning without my bike or at least minus a race number http://t.co/XzqeIX40oL
@BijuTheChef @chipotleboss1 @ChipotleTweets dude come on! You are killing us over here!!! Cruel!
Off bike highlights so far...quick rinse off in the ocean post stage 2day AND meeting/chatting with Glen Plake yesterday! #legend #usa
Into some "hills" (or mtns where i come from) for today's stage. Sun, nerves, fetching bottles and some riding the front. All to plan here.
Tossing out updates over at http://t.co/KrI8EpjuwI during the next 3 weeks @letour
Hidden stats of day...3 wheel changes, 8 bottles drank, finished on my spare bike, tejay on my bike, and someone else's blood on my shoe!
Thanks for the concern, i am OK! No crash for me. A classic cluster of a tdf finale but happy that we all made it through. One down...
Thanks @OakleySports @blick and @kikooakley for something special to commemorate #TDF100 #stylin #radarlock http://t.co/jC0JouZnHT

On the literal holding "dock" waiting for team presentation. http://t.co/KiV6CwA5fU
Sums it up..“@velonews: American Brent Bookwalter talks about riding for Cadel Evans and Tejay van Garderen at Tour. http://t.co/7Jtumd11Le”
I'm usually not one for "selfy shots" but hey, it's @letour. Smooth trip with the Girona mafia. 3 days till curtain http://t.co/QXPjYJ8o4X
"News" is a generous word for most of it  #hypeshow “@Bonnie_D_Ford: Usual debris-laden flood-tide of pre-#TdF news. #makeitstop”
@Kpcusack thanks Kevin. See you in france? Thanks for helping to get here. Will never forget where I came from.
@jakerytlewski thanks snake! I will be drifting back to those days in my mind next month! Hope all is well with you
Congrats @michaelschaer!! Most deserving national champ of the season!?! Nice, selfless, strong guys do finish first. #inspiring
Excited, proud and honored to be selected to ride the 100th #TDF w/ @BMCProTeam! new perspective and appreciation after missing last years
BIG Congrats to @ivansantino on his win yesterday! AND Thank you for helping cycling move FORWARD!! #grande #thenewkiller?

Nice to have these things explained. Feeling so hip right now...Bro Map http://t.co/FkYby2PFEZ attn: @larrywarbasse @taylorphinney
11 days living the "high life" DUN. Felt like living in a post card! Thanks @CadelOfficial @steve_morabito @DavidBombeke @antoniobiron.
@1bigbikeracefan thanks for the vote!!!
@DustyWheels thanks for the support!!!
@NVBikeFest I appreciate the live feed but how about a camera at the top of the climb where we could actually see the riders!?!?
@BobsRedMill any way or place to find BobsRedMill in Europe?!? Spain in particular? I bring over as much as I can but am running low!
Congrats to Athens GA homeboy @joeyrosskopf on his win @TOURDEBEAUCE today!
thanks for the "form feedback" today, David “@DavidBombeke: @CadelOfficial @brentbookwalter @steve_morabito at work http://t.co/nvmkPl560G”
Massive congrats to Mathias Frank and @BMCProTeam for taking the jersey in Switzerland!
Dauphine DUN. Now into the clouds for a few days... http://t.co/gICmliHFF7
Morning math...According to #dauphine race book, The race has 70,000 feet of climbing over 8 days. Including flat Tt. #freshasadaisy
It took all week but we finally got a hotel with bunk beds! Now all is right in the world. http://t.co/2Vn4YlmFTY
@Mickeyhavoc thanks Mike
All things considered, today was about as nice as they come in races like the Dauphine. Minus the bike change into the final climb. #whammy
Good talking with you guys... “@PezCycling: PEZ Talk: BMC’s Brent Bookwalter http://t.co/TG57zJWD0S”
Just casually tweeting to 2 friends. For sport. For fun! @BenKing89. @zider24.  The stuff that goes through your mind during a bike race...
Different team, different country, but it's still good to see a North American from the USA scene deliver on the big stage over here. #grit
Thank to @JuliaWeide for featuring me in her magazine. Maybe @velonews should hire her now!? http://t.co/6ho5KH6m0s
@manuelquinziato @portugaltheman dude they've been top of my playlist for months now! Lets get that going on the bus tomorrow
Nothing like 3 days on the TT bike to yank ya out of jet-lag haze. Now Geneva bound, Dauphine starts Sunday. More relaxing than last week?!
@CoachTimHall thanks for setting them straight! #collegiatecycling

@jebbie_crowe nice to see you! Thanks for the pics!
From sunny, beautiful, warm, friendly, loving, delicious Chattanooga to damp, dark, crowded, moody, baguette filled Paris over night. #ouch
Not satisfied with the result but proud of how I rode and "our" effort this weekend. Team, family, friends, fans. Humbled by so much support
@zider24 welcome to my world
@DivasTourFrance @lucaseuser @iamtedking maybe Unicorns for those guys but I'm thinking I'm more of a dragon for tomorrow
I may be the only @BMCProTeam rider here, but I have 3 amazing team mates with me... @TrudiLR @Sevenpelicans and Ian Sherburne. #worldclass
Thank you to everyone who supported me today, especially those who are ALWAYS there for me. Team, family, friends, strangers... Incredible
Home &amp; reflecting on last week. So much of what I love about racing! @BMCProTeam @AmgenTourofCali #USA #WINNING #awesomefans #burritos
@Mickeyhavoc where??? Hook it up!!
@anitabfranklin thanks!!
@HtotheOOP thanks! Proud to be from the mitten
@thek2 appreciated no matter which continent we are on!
Thank U @AmgenTourofCali and all of the fans for a beautiful stage today. Huge pleasure to be racing in USA and on great courses.
Loving this race!“@BijuTheChef: @brentbookwalter about to have recovery burger @skratchlabs kitchen @amgentourofcali http://t.co/gtMpTKHdTG”
@SkratchLabs thanks for the post stage burrito! You guys will be at every other race I do this season, right? Please!!
Honourable mention to @cjonez for stopping and helping a fellow heat-stroked competitor laying on the road yesterday. #strengthandhonour
Thanks to @blick and @OakleySports I have 1 part of my body that is fresh after 2 HOT days, My eyeballs. #radarlock http://t.co/gxUOOfrytz

From the city where I live to the city where I'm from...“@BlogAsheville: Congrats, Grand Rapids! #BeerCityUSA  Enjoy the title, #avlbeer”
Thank you @lululemon in San Diego for the awesome "welcome" to California.  Who knew piñatas and bike racers went so well together? #FUN
@anitabfranklin every little bit helps! I've ridden all those roads but was looking for some more info. Will be fun to race in the south!
@JFTanner would be happy to chat. If you could contact @sweide our team PR officer he can help set it up. Look forward to speaking w you
@JFTanner @anitabfranklin planning on it! I love Chattanooga. Lived there for a while when my wife was finishing at UTC.
Happy Bday to the guy who has been with me as a coach and friend through it all the past few years, Todd @HerriottSP. Stab your bday beast!
Anyone out there at the @USACRITS race in sandy springs, GA driving to Asheville this evening????
@sweide @juliaweide I enjoyed it. Very professional and interesting questions! Some other journalists could learn a thing or two from Julia!
Congrats to Spencer Oswald and my alma mater Lees-McRae College on their TT win @USACcollegiate road national championships!
Congrats @TeamColavita1! @laurakatbrown wins Tybee Island Crit @USACRITS! Especially proud of @jamiebookwalter
We are in good hands...“@sweide: Thanks, Julia! RT @JuliaWeide: So proud of my dad, @sweide. He's back doing social media for @BMCProTeam.”
Back in beautiful Switzerland for my 4th stab @tourofromandie. Always on my list of places that I must visit post cycling career.
LBL team presentation. Waiting, A live bar band, lots of loud French and my weekly quota of "stink-eye".
Takes a full day to decompress from these 1-day races. Proud of our effort yesterday at flèche-wallone. Now some mega hotel time before LBL
@thek2 yep I think I was the only Brent out there yesterday. Inconspicuous life of a worker bee. Hope your enjoying the trip. Here Sunday?
@jackieblackaday @athenstwilight always a fun night. Maybe you can petition my team to send me back stateside early for the occasion!?
@dwuori yo thanks for the pic! Hard to find much coverage of the ladies so its appreciated.
It's been 8 years since I pulled the "DNS" move during a stage race. Hated it then, same feeling today. Wishing @BMCProTeam mates the best
From one independence crazed part of spain to another. Hoping whatever the trees r shooting into the air in Girona is not here in Basque!
@B_Magner dude...we live a good life
Big congrats to @chad_capobianco for his collegiate win in Brevard this weekend. Hard work, dedication and passion paying off!
Tossing some updates out over at http://t.co/7qlpT9nNyK. Lots o racing coming up so come visit. Suggestions for site welcome!
Stout day here at http://t.co/7Y5466NZ3T.  wind, rain, rocks, mega climbs &amp; long airport trip to finish it. Nice team dig with @bmcproteam
@thachad that's offensive you even had to ask
Your telling me this call couldn't have been made this morning?! Good luck guys! # MSRCircus “@gregorbrown: Turchino http://t.co/SWuf3kSOa1”

5 countries, 2 continents, in 4 days, ending up about 500 km from where i started. #livingthedream
If what doesn't kill me makes me stronger, I will be a beast after last week @ParisNice. Great work with @bmcproteam riders and staff!
AMERICA! “@HerringWSJ: Don't know why I'm surprised to see this at Whole Foods. most Whole Foods-like item ever. http://t.co/ste4jSxOkC”
I would like to think safe riding conditions should be for ALL in the race, not just first 40 guys. Fact: only 40 guys can fit in first 40
Like cows going to slaughter. It's not if there will be crashes, it's when, who and how many? Today it was me again, with a pile of others
@PodiumCafe how bout the mass pile up on the mud slicked cow path as a notable event?!  There's a good dose of drama and carnage for you
Fell victim to urban acrobatics here @ Paris-nice, rider in front of me lost his front wheel in sandy corner, boom. Sore and battered but ok
No more authentic way to start my first french race of the year than with 3 nights at a Campanile. #indoorcamping #parisnice
Biggest winner of the day is without a doubt @PhilippeGilbert  enjoy the celebration and think of us! #wiseguy
all day battling in Milan airport may be better than freezing, crashing on ice, getting sick after. But only barely. Glad I'm carbo loaded
Disappointing for everyone to cancel a race but no doubt the right call. http://t.co/XbFeIgAHLm
Looks like no matter what race you are at, snow is part of bike racing today. Just because you "can" doesn't mean you "should" #brr #lugano
Good luck to the guys AND girls at #omloop today. Especially @Jamiedinkins and @BMCProTeam! Judging by the snow in spain, belge will be brrr
@cbutler88 you next? Happy birthday brah! Good luck over there
2:30 AM departure from hotel to airport here @TourOfOman3. It's not early. Its Not late, but i would call it, stupid. 22 hours till Girona
Thanks for the bday wishes and thanks to @BMCProTeam for a great 2 weeks of racing in the desert. Pleasure to race with this squad!
Last day of anarchy transfer to stage start while packed into a Toyota Corolla   @TourOfOman #growingpains?
@louderjeff we are all dying to know.... How many kilometres and kilojoules did you and @louderjeff do?!?!?
Stout day at #TourOfOman. Nice to be up the road with 4 other motivated and strong dudes, plowing the wind. Cadel up to 2nd overall!
“@dwuori: Oman I wish they had cameras.” Cameras would be nice. I'm also a fan of toilets at the start &amp; full size team cars. #weaksauce
Today at #TourOfOman, adhering to UCI rule 9.9.9 "The longest stage of race shall coincide w/ longest pre AND post stage transfers of race"
Thank you! @stevocummings @michaelschaer @larrywarbasse @gregvanavermaet @taylorphinney @adamblythe89 and #Yannick” @BMCProTeam
NOT a straight forward day. Hit the ground hard early in stage, but bounced back into it w help of team. Really proud of what WE did here
They shut down an entire city for us today at #tourofqatar http://t.co/CYUVINvn
Special thankYOU to my roomie @michaelschaer for escorting me through those crazy final kms. Calm. Confident and stronglikebull
Another day being supported by 7 of the worlds best riders. Bummed to lose the jersey but proud of how we have ridden. Thanks @BMCProTeam!
Congrats to @MarkCavendish on the win. Hopefully our man @taylorphinney is ok after his pavement surfing and and can give him a run tmrw!
What an experience to have such an amazing 7 guys taking care of me and looking out today. Stellar work by everyone! Thank you @bmcproteam!
Capital "T" for TEAMtt today! Brilliant riding by the guys and work by the staff. So humbled &amp; proud to wear leaders jersey for this group
Awesome team effort by @BMCProTeam! Truly not possible without all team mates, staff and sponsors of the organisation. #honoured
Still searching for words, Thank U everyone for the kind words. And THANK YOU to all those who are always there for me &amp; pushing me forward
judging by my inherent paleness, i was not built to be a desert creature. Yet, here I am back in Qatar http://t.co/rjVeYfzS
Never mind the latest filth, Plenty of exciting news in cycling this week...USPRO course info for Chattanooga and cross world in USA! Whoop
@taylorphinney who is the crazy one now? #oatmealinridicule cc: @larrywarbasse
500 laps on the velodrome and 8 hrs in the skin suit today. Dizzy, tired, mean. But all in the name of progress. #teameffort @BMCProTeam
Back to the living for the final few days of team camp. Stout ride with a few of the guys today and catching up with @joelfelicio and crew
Remembering @carlaGNswart today and Thinking of everyone who was fortunate enough to have her in their lives. Live every day to its fullest!
@Ritannette2 maybe a little better but about the same. Seems like virus
@anitabfranklin happy to carry the flag! Thanks for the continued support and believing in us and the sport
To the gremlin who has takin up residence in my stomach the past couple days, Please LEAVE! I want to get back to work http://t.co/6PkkU4xz
@J_Tubb thanks for the support!
@USACcollegiate thank for the updates. Can you post names from the d2 results?
Guilty as charged. And lucky! “@USACcollegiate: There are so many collegiate cycling love stories out there... http://t.co/aCW9sUEx”
Now that we've been officially "presented", time to get down to biznass w some bike riding. Happy to be in spain with @BMCProTeam
Girona, bikes...it just makes sense..."@BikeBreaks: Hey! we've only got 292 followers on Twitter.. that's not much at all.. Please RT
Travel = tweets. Back across the pond after an awesome couple months in the homeland. First up, Belgium for team presentation
Merry Christmas! Hope everyone's day turns out this good. Complete with christmas colors. http://t.co/2gLjWbEZ
Best thing I've read out of the cycling world in a LONG time... Cycling Becomes A Cleaner Sport, Not a Safer One http://t.co/rB0SbgGE
THANK YOU family, friends, supporters and team for being with me and making this season one worth remembering. Back to USA and some downtime
Final training ride for the '12 season. Wet, dark, windy... France.
Packing, cleaning bonanza. Last day in Girona for a while. Psyched to finish the season w paris-tours then head for the homeland.
@michaelschaer looks like a bad dream, help!
October!?!  Out the door to Belge for "Binche-Tournai-Binche". Then Paris-Tours this weekend to close 2012 season. #yeararoundsport
@thearamD it drags on, doesn't it? Don't forget still a couple weeks to go. I know you will be glued to the paris-tours + china coverage
Glad I sat through the preceding 100 km of lombardia coverage to catch these awesome finish line shots w 10 km to go. #sarcasm. #junkshow
Bummed to not be racing today. Still coming out of the woods from last weeks chest infection and cough fest #couchcheerleader
Thank you @usacycling for an awesome few days. Always an honor and true pleasure. Reminder that bike racing is supposed to be fun! #America
Cough meds, antibiotics-not the normal path to peaking, but with such a great group of guys its easy to be psyched &amp; ready to rock! #teamUSA
Big congrats to @taylorphinney and Tejay for their rides 2day, WOW! Meanwhile in Belgium, @AdamBlythe89  2nd. Cobwebs from easy week r gone
@thearamD most valuable! Tell me you or someone you know didn't pay shipping on that!?!
Today, battling for glory, prestige and honor in the windy Flemish flat lands! LICHTERVELDE!
Must have been living in a time-warp because that week went by quickly. Up to belgium today, no season is complete without an Izegem visit
Deep into week 3, things I miss (among others)... Bathroom fans, screens on windows, LOGIC, the outside world.
Shortest path between 2 points...straight line.  Most difficult path between 2 points... a stage in week 3 at the #vuelta. Rockemsockem
Where am I? What day is it? How did I get here?
Learned today that is better to stay away from @Phil_Gilbert1 and @aleballan79 when hunting "pushes" on crazy climbs. #noloveforthelittleguy

@anitabfranklin yep! Need to sell my services to @lonelyplanet
Tough stage, long transfer, and a hotel which I'm sure offers an affordable hourly rate. Week 2 just about done! #thedream
@fitsweep thanks! Hopefully I can stay "fit" until then :)
Very happy and honored to be selected as part of Team USA for the World Championships! Racing with the homies, for the homeland! #kickass
Congrats to my wife Jamie!!! "@Sevenpelicans: Bookwalter 4th on Volterra stage. #GiroToscana #usacwomen moves up GC as well."
However impressive that victory looked, I can assure you it was 10 times more. Incredible! Congrats to my #vuelta roomie @SteveoCummings
Quite a tt course they've concocted at the #vuelta. Not everyday I do a 10 km climb on my tt bike, or ever, for that matter. What a treat.
@podiuminsight fun? Its a work in progress. Paella? No! Though I've had enough white race to feed a small country. Send me flavor, please?
At #vuelta they close one side of most roundabouts we go through. Brilliant! More races should take note. Cyclists + decisions = mess
Outside...My arms are covered w/ something other than sun screen and sweat 4 the first time in 12 days. Happy to b in Andorra for tonight.
Was under the impression the #vuelta was a trip "through" spain. Started today only 100 km from where we were a week ago. Circles are fun!
@thomaswparry yes, I can. I don't do it daily but I do check. Also, comments from my website are emailed to me
YES! PLEEEASE!..."@taylorphinney: This might be premature, but I've got to say it. The USA needs a grand tour! I heart racing in America."
Must be the #Vuelta if today's 100 degree temps felt "not as hot" and tomorrows 945 wake-up sounds early. Halfway to halfway
@_Gavia_ apparantly they were notorious for that in utah too, I heard. One camera. There's more to a race then the guys up the road!
@_Gavia_ who is chasing in the "field"?
@_Gavia_ I'd say call it a "split". Especially when it happens in a USA race.
Soaking up final few min's. on bus before heading into our hotel, whcih has given bmc riders hives/rashes on 2 seperate occasions. #thedream
Happy Birthday, MOM!  Hope you have a great day!
Thanks for the nice write up"@_Gavia_: I talked to @brentbookwalter of @BMCProTeam about his season so far and Vuelta, http://t.co/KI9igLDW"
@thearamD thanks man! Cool to know someone back home is watching.
When do the negative effects of dehydration outweigh the benefits from massage. I think I'm across the threshold. Furnace! Muycaliente
Not sure which is a more violent shock.. The 8 hrs of jet lag, or the cultural "lag" of going from USA-PLUSHness to euro race accommodations
@Dennis_9999 impossible to reduce it to one reason. Bigger bunch, smaller roads, more road furniture, desperate "win or die" attitude.
Does this mean the salad we had at dinner was organic!? http://t.co/thzZEZMC
Our Soigneur Dirk has done the Vuelta 16 times, hombre es loco! He said a lot has changed since then. Yet still no working internet.
@thearamD so far, its ok. B+ for room quality. C- for location. F for the peculiar smell, and D+ for the food.
@HeleneBarrette I will miss being Quebec and the only chance all year to race a protour race in my home time zone!
We've come a long way... "@S_Jackson_: This week, 3 former residents of Banner Elk NC are in Pamplona. @andrewtalansky @brentbookwalter
What have I got myself into!?!...."@PodiumCafe: La Vuelta a Espana... Stage-By-Stage! http://t.co/TQXkXEr0"
Altitude stage race, 3 days of travel and 8 hours jet lag. Then, add water.... Peaking!
Its very rare that I get to the end of a stage race and want it to actually keep going, this last week at @tourofutah was one of those.
@thearamD tomorrow will tell... Thanks for the cheers mane
@WestonShirey thanks man. See u tmrw!
Racing in the USA is fun. Having Johan pull off a BIG Win for the team...Wicked Fun! Proud of all the riders and staff here @BMCProTeam
@IamAuntieEm thanks!
TTT...Truth.Tricky.Tried. Went as fast as we could, just not fast enough. Nice job by our swiss mtb phenom Mattias, 2nd day ever on TT bike!
Not much to say going into todays TTT that hasn't already been said. Make sure to follow @podium_live for updates once we get rolling
@tadd_a thanks!
@craiglewis85 thanks craig. Good to be racing w u again. Will have to chat one of these days
@thomaswparry thanks! Say hi to Julian for me. Still have his card he made me in my suitcase.
5th year in a row at tour of Utah, always a pleasure to be here. Incredible scenery, friendly people and a world class course. #tou12
@thearamD naw man, to spain straight after utah
@heathdotson Mr. Pine doesnt do too much strava'ing but likes to get in on the fun. I bet if you work hard at it you can get him.
Big THANK YOU to @19sports in park city for getting me back on the road today. BMC family!

@butterflywriter I will be in utah, but not CO. That's a tough call...huge to race at "home" but grand tour important too.
Good grief...What he said.."@UberReed: That result is like I just woke up from a bad dream.
Awesome to see #TeamUSA and my @BMCProTeam team mates repp'n in the olympic road race this morning. I hope everyone is watching
Olympic RR tomorrow, already!?! Wishing the best for all of Team America. I'm sure they will do us proud.
@DivasTourFrance I don't think so. Sad face.
Last couple of days at home before hitting the road for the long push to end of season. Time flies with good people in a great place

True! "@marcopinotti: I rate Tour of Austria as one of the top week long races. Awesome places, good hotel, short transfer, safe roads."
@MBurghardt83 nice job man. That looked like at least a 5 or 6? Good luck for tomorrow
BMC PR Wizard @sweide pumping out that race winning tweet before podium duty. Congrats @marcopinotti !!! http://t.co/RrrycFiI
TT day in austria. The scenery and terrain here have impressed me everyday, but NOT today. Drag strip. Airport runway. Flat.Fast.HoT.Nasty.
@_Gavia_ guns don't kill people.....
Among other factors..."@_Gavia_: Polemica over race radios breaking out again. Me, I think it’s not the radios, it’s the humans using them."
HoTT and uncomfortable day in Austria, but took care of our man, Morabito. Sorry for all the TDF crashes today. Same madness, different year
@anitabfranklin thanks for the support, despite me not being in #thatbigbikerace.
Nice pic of the podium from yesterday http://t.co/iEyaiv50

12 hrs later, finally in Austria. Ironically google maps says it would have taken 12 hrs to drive here. Brilliant day in the life
No, I will not be in France for the next month. Thanks to those who sent @s lately. Will do my best to make some lemonade this season.
That's my girl! Going for it! "@podium_live: Dinkins-Bookwalter of espnw/colavita on the attack inside on 8 km to go #roadnats"
Wow! Yea Paco! "@BMCProTeam: Here's your new Swiss national road champion. Congratulations, @martinkohler7  http://t.co/5JzcUNwn"
EasyJet (SleezyJet) does it again... Via @nprnews: Med Student Rescues Body Part From Airport Security http://t.co/e3rsfbNu
@MatthewBusche killer roads brah! Thanks for the tour!
@DivasTourFrance thanks for the pic! Feeling a little in the dark over here. Sitting here w evelyn's boyfriend, so any updates r good!
@iamtedking ass and soul... The two things most commonly left behind during a day like today.  Hope you are ok and regrow that skin fast!
Bummed to miss a big chance today, but left every ounce of myself out on the road. Thanks to @Mickeyhavoc for keeping me going
@cyclephotos any cool pics? That was nothing compared to doing the same while bumping elbows w 150 others, &amp; the photo motos, in the rain
@Broker_Jeff I thought the official name was "festivus"? Wish I was gonne be there!
BIG congrats to @craiglewis85 on his comeback win at Beauce! Perseverance paying off.
@podiuminsight thanks lyne. Still an amateur at this "follow a race" thing. Hope all is well w u
@NVBikeFest thanks! But the page was empty? Speedy results increase followers in coming days!
@NVBikeFest do u have a link for full women's tt results??!!??
Many choice adjectives come to mind when reflecting on today's stage.  Most not twitter approved.  I feel like a cave man.
Hoping the creature who had taken residence in my guts the last 48 hrs has finally moved on to another locale. More rain/wind/nasty in swiss
Back in the Ticino/Lugano area for Tour de Suisse. A little hectic in the city but not to shabby up on the hill sides http://t.co/aaJkpeQt
Tomorrow its back to racing in Europe..."EasyJet" renamed...."RidiculouslyDifficultAbsurdAndFrustrating-JET.
thank you high-def cycling coverage... a double "rat tail" haircut?!  I'm speechless
Congrats @CadelOfficial and @BMCProTeam!  Inspiring to ride for a guy who can pull off a feat like that.
where can i find live updates for Philly? particularly the women's race?!?!
Group ride and some extra time on the parkway... nice way to spend my last full day in Asheville before heading across tmrw.
2 bike changes and a single speed for the last 15 km...Not my day today but still nice to be racing in the southeast. Thanks everyone!
@IamAuntieEm thanks!
@SeeHowWell thank u!
@craiglewis85 thanks man. See u monday

@DivasTourFrance yes they did! Thank you!
@tmtco your very welcome. I'm a big fan of the firm handshake, that will serve him well! Thanks for the support
Watching the ladies race on the ExergyTourTracker. Really cool to see them get a high quality race and some solid coverage. #EXGT
@podiuminsight thanks for the updates! Give jamie a big GO JAMIE for me!
Stoked to see Mattias Frank finding the right move at the Giro today! About to heat up!
Long travel day back to the east side from cali, but all worth it to be part of such a great USA event. Thanks to all who made it happen
@DivasTourFrance thanks! Yep, Greenville next weekend. See you there?
Top notch! Great week. Thanks team!..."@Mickeyhavoc: @BMCProTeam staff..just killing it all week for the boys at @AmgenTourofCali"
Driving down from Big Bear and having an "I'm old" moment. I was up here 11 years ago for a mtb race. Still beautiful, still thin air
Happy bday to @GregVanAvermaet! As a treat he gets to sit in a camper w sweaty dudes and ride is bike through a desolate desert. Shwing!
I got fined today for "incorrect behavior", whatever that means. Too bad the officials don't get fined for all of their incorrect behavior
Congrats to Santa Rosa for a putting on a great day of TOC. Its been a nice few days here. time to start picking our way south tomorrow
@scotttemplar thanks scott. Glad to squeak thru that one. Hope all is well back in michigan
Surprisingly busy couple of pre-race days here in cali. Fortunately not without solid doses of sun, good coffee and burritos. Tmrw we race!
One out of comp test for the entire spring and now 3 in the last week. I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys hanging out in the USA
Sounds good to me..."@manuelquinziato: People who does thing like Ferrari today or Rojas at Gand Wevelghem should get 3 months ban!"
Wow wow wow. I get back from riding and find out @taylorphinney has pink!?!  Nice job T!
Summertime on the blue ridge parkway.. Nice to be home! http://t.co/bC6obkpp
Psyched @podiuminsight will be bringing us updates from guys and especially the LADIES @tourgila. Nervous and not even at the races!
Please tell me this is some kind of sick and twisted joke...unacceptable  http://t.co/KrlYzf4b"
4 years ago tour of Romandie was my first pro tour race. It was TOUGH in 2008 and I can say the same for '12. Still chippin away at it.
Wishing all the homies back in Athens, GA a good Twilight weekend. Epic Energy! Picking @jpmurph8 for the computrainer showdown tonight.
I thought spring had finished being "sprung".  Doesn't appear to be the case in Romandie. Mucous mania 2012 has returned. Snot for watts?
Somebody has a case of the "Mondays"...
Finally coming out of the fog after yesterdays smash fest at LBL. Already in cold/damp swissland for tour of Romandie which starts tmrw.
One more day perfecting "the big chill" in the hotel before LBL. I've used up every @portlandiatv episode so not sure what to do w myself!
Does anyone remember the Tv show "David the Gnome"?  I'm pretty sure it took place in the Ardennes of Belgium. Maybe I will see him today!
Also BiG congrats to @evelyn_stevens on her monumental win in the women's race!
And back to racing! Pleasure and an honor to race with the @BMCProTeam classics squad. Congrats to Phil + everyone involved on a solid day!
Congrats to @BMCProTeam on their TTT win at Trentino!! Shredding it!
Back in the Belge and prepping for fleche wallone. Last time I was here @CadelOfficial snagged the teams first BIG "W"! Nice memory
I struck gold NOT doing the spring spanish races this year. Snow again? madness-mess! where is the solidarity amongst the riders?
Almost time to head back to the races. One more weekend in Girona and then off to Belgium, Swiss, and finally the good ole USA!
@larrywarbasse nice man!  Would be more impressed though if it was a hard COURSE. That parkour stuff is pretty nuts though.
Not super pumped about the "spider web glass" feature which apparantly comes standard on Apple iPad displays. Made for traveling!?!?
And by crit. "international"... They mean it takes so long to get home from the race that you could have travelled halfway around the world.
Proud to be part of @BMCProTeams WIN at Criterium International today! Always an honour working with these guys and for @CadelOfficial
@A_Craig haven't you learned by now that standard logic does not apply regarding said topic?
Heading to Corsica for Criterium International. Looking forward to seeing a new place, but less psyched about the 2-day trip to get there!
True story!...."@SkratchLabs: Recipe for the best energy bar ever: http://t.co/i2WAyZ8p"
@antisepticsoap day after day? Sliding across pavement at 50 mph? Left for dead if you lose contact with leaders too early?
Really feeling for the guys in Catalunya. Forced to race in miserable conditions, suffer, endure, then told its all for nothing. Madness!
Anyone who doesn't believe cycling is the most difficult (at times to absurdity) sport in world, check out todays stage at #VoltaCatalunya
Will be fun to follow #msr tomorrow. Maybe best part about not doing that race is missing out on the disturbing amounts pre race pasta.
Just heard Athens, GA band "Of Montreal" on spanish radio and the dj talkin bout their upcoming Barcelona concert. nice taste of home.
for those die hard BB followers.. been doing a little updating over at http://t.co/aIWY9H4N
Nice to finish Paris-Nice with some sun, in good condition and with a solid result from @BMCProTeam. Great work by everyone all week!
I knew I should have ate more sausage last winter! Jimmy Dean sponsorship, please!?!
@iamtedking good call. You know, tomorrow the REAL paris-nice BEGINS!
Yesterday gave us a full dose of the "Paris" part. I'm ready for the "Nice" part. Looks like we will have to wait.
@jasper808 ha! Good point. But there was a beautiful simplicity of those times. Fun. Hope you guys are well.
@MsIngaSpoke nope. Sorry
I would love to meet the genius who wired this hotel room so that none of the outlets worked unless all the lights were on. Brilliant
@iamtedking I can think of about a hundred other nouns or adjectives to slip in there. None of them positive, many not rated "PG"
I retract my pre race tweet. It wasn't even a nice day to fly a kite! Nice work by our young whipper snappers to be up front when it counted
Nice day in France, if you are looking to fly a kite.
@UCI_Overlord I agree! I'll add rejoining- twitter-peer-pressure to my role of team mate duties this week.
Nice work by Tejay! Too bad he quit twitter. As for me, gave what I thought was a good go, but very underwhelming when all said and done
@christianmeier when u aren't using it, pull it apart, otherwise the seal will get mashed down and be less effective. Enjoy!
Cool to see @BikeBreaks on twitter! An awesome crew and yet another reason why Girona is such a great place for all things "bikes".
People watching at airport... Smoking breaks.  Wow, I live a good life. Thankful.
@larrywarbasse how did you know it was 77?  don't tell me you looked at your power meter?!?!
Awesome to hear it only took 4 hours for over 2000 people to register (and FILL) for @IcemanTCMI. Cycling is alive and well in Michigan
Anarchy of milan malpansa + SLeasyJET while eating an airport panini, can't help but feel a bit salty bout all the guys who r already home!
@iamtedking but good seeing u and congrats on the W
@iamtedking sorry don't remember that. Had to cash in IQ points and memory "chips" to make my mind more numb with for that shit fighting.
4.5 hrs of swiss-italian pinball on the road-construction filled streets of Lugano. Nice top 5 by local boy @maurosanta84. Next up, P-Nice.
Off to Swiss 4 GP Lugano. Last time I did this race it was stopped due to a car sneaking onto course and hitting rider! #betterluckthistime
Sunny skies, rising temps, budding flowers...spring is in the air. Time for mucous mania 2012!
Continuing to send thoughts and prayers back to Athens, GA for fellow cyclist and all around good guy, Cal Hooten. Hit by DWI while riding
First "BIG" day of 2012, ouch!...wishing @StevoCummings a fast recovery. If he heals half as fast as he rides, he'll be back in no time.
First and likely not last race of the year when I come to breakfest w an earplug behind my ear. Thanks @tvangarderen88 for the heads up!
Thanks everyone for the bday wishes! 28 not all doom n gloom..solid day of pedaling in sun and cake/wine from @BMCProTeam to finish it off
First trip to Portugal. Nothing too distinct to report yet, but I'm guessing today's racing will make up for that. Saddle up partner.
seems like it takes me packing a suitcase 4 the "next step" to realize that I finally felt "settled" with the step I was just on! #Algarve
Amazing how much better life is with intact, fully functioning teeth! Glad to have that ordeal wrapped up. Don't forget to floss kids!
Sending get well wishes to @jpmurph8. Talk about UPS and DOWNS to start the season. I'm sure he'll be back on podium again soon
usually not much for a music-tweeter, but I am feeling some @theblackkeys lately.  something about them makes me feel 'Merican
Nothing like a mid training taxi-ride to get the fitness levels up. Better to have gear break than body break though.
Wishing I was with @BMCProTeam in Mallorca today. Instead I am in dentist chair having root canal round 2.
@AdamBlythe89 like a boss
Onto last bag of @Bobs_Red_Mill "Mighty Tasty". Makes me feel mighty, and its tasty, all at the same time! what happens when it runs out?!
Regretting my previous comments about enjoying a climate which includes 4 seasons. What happened to my Michigan toughness!?!?
@craiglewis85 I think that's my old neighbor
Adding another notch to my "american living abroad" belt today... Spanish root canal.
Not my finest day...Walked out door with mismatched shoes. Unsuccessful dentist appt for pain cave tooth, and a bicycle parking ticket.
Big congrats to @Ty_Magner and. @hincapieDevo for their win at TourBahamas!  nice to see all the hard work pay off.
@STEVENCOZZA yo man are you in Girona?  hook me up with your current contact info
Cancelled flight so rolling 3 deep in front of team van to Girona. Still chuckling after last nights stand up comedy act by @taylorphinney
Productive 2 weeks of full-tilt training camp about to wrap up. Riders, staff and everyone involved are looking sharp.
Big THANK YOU to @HerriottSP for helping with the eternal battle for ideal cleat/shoe placement today.
Inspired and psyched to hear about @martinkohler7 and @BMCProTeam making some noise down under! Nice work guys!
Sunny skies, good company, a pile of new gear and a shiny new BMC whip... Nice to be "camping"
@delta welcomed me to Spain with an emailing saying my bags didn't make it. glad those "priority" tags did the trick. #deltaFAIL
@TheDPate that's the question of the month. Glad I'm not the only one asking that.
Heading to Spain to get 2012 with @BMCProTeam underway. My 5th year with the team! Looking forward to getting down to biznss w everyone.
Congrats @JeremyPowers! Well deserved and earned. The athens scene is psyched your time spent here payed off!
Productive 48 hrs in cali. Now warming up for my trip across the pond next week with a trip across the country today.
@i0n1c searching for iPad 2 untethered 4.3.5 jailbreak and ur name keeps coming up. Is it available yet?
@chad_capobianco fewq
Check out my friend's new site http://t.co/zsK80iPC where you can get deals on fitness trainers. Looks like a cool site!
Best part about riding through the chattahoochee national forest is being prompted to say "chatahooch" out loud. Its fun, try it!
@secretdrinkmix he grilled me on "road side peeing" then called in my info and mentioned the guy who reported was basically a psycho.
To the person who called the cops on me today for peeing in the trees along a desolate country road... Get a life!
@chad_capobianco when and where?
Hey local Athenians... Any sort of WBL warm-up ride going on tomorrow? Who's in town?
Thankful for more than a tweet can contain.  Hope everyone had a great day!
@Greg_Punzo thanks!
Anyone know if there is a place to find a reliable live-stream for the Packers-Lions game tomorrow?
Decided to break my annual off-season "cycling website/news" boycott...looks like I wasn't missing much.
Whoop! http://t.co/l28sbCD8
@Ty_Magner nice man! Worth the trip right there. Keep it rolling
Back to the real world but cannot complain... Nice to be home! What did I miss?
Thanks everyone for all the well-wishes!  Gonna head off the grid for a few days. Then its back and down to business.
Well... I can now say I am happily MARRIED! What an incredible weekend with family and friends. Very thankful for all of the love!
@DivasTourFrance thanks ladies!
Thanks to Groome Transportation for the kick between the legs to welcome me home.
5th and final day of bike testing/meetings...stage race. Lotsa good stuff for 2012! Now clicking heels together...no place like home.
@MatthewBusche good luck man! Let me know how it goes.
Ok... I'll go ahead and claim that one. Good luck??? "@Mickeyhavoc: "I just got #*?! On by a bird"...rider to be named later"
Como, italy with @BMCProTeam for the next few days.  Prepping, meeting and dialing it in for 2012. Happy New Year!
@podiuminsight
Turning into a long one. I'll take ATL over CDG any day.
Just picked up a sweet set of NUNCHUCKS, in China! Legit!
Suited up and rode to start but knee gave me an emphatic "NO GO". Absolutely hate pulling the pin. Sucks to leave my BMC bros 4 next 2 days.
UNACCEPTABLE!! "@BMCProTeam: Witnesses blame a low-flying TV helicopter for blowing the course signage into Yannick Eijssen @TourofBeijing.
The VALUE continues. Managed to stick it out and make it through today. Most of body loosened up ok, aside from knee which got worse.
battered and bruised but not completely broken. Not sure why my arm pit is such a desirable place 4 guys to ride? Might be a long one 2nite
@dontcallmekaty thanks! What issue did you find that in? Haven't seen it yet.
Hey China! What's up with the midget-massage tables?! Thanks to @Chrissoigneur making due! http://t.co/0QSjOE5K
@Ty_Magner that's my favorite word... Experience. So many meanings. U need a new twitter name. @youngbeave
"Organized" group ride... Nice-er roads and solid sun. No need for sunscreen, film of dust works as SPF. Saw a wall... Maybe the great?
Authentic china-gridlock on way to training ride start.  I think all 20 million ppl in Beijing are in their cars right now.
Beijing bound. Only 22 hours to go.  On a brighter note... Airport drop-off by my favorite gal in da world was sweet! Am I in europe?
@MatthewBusche
Its been a fun few days in Denmark, American style. Great group of guys this year! Hope to be back again in the future.
Racing. In belgium. Today.  I predict small roads, wind, overcast skies and lots of fighting. Maybe a stray alien or 2
Will be interesting to see how many riders actually make it to China for Tour Beijing. Does UCI realize the local 7-11 doesn't sell Visas?
Few things are as disturbing and annoying as human behavior around a "RyanAir" flight.
Jetlag and a 5 am trip to airport. Yes the cycling season is still going full steam. Its World Champs week!
@KarstenKroon how you healing?
@Perryguitar666 dude! cool! Thanks for passing it along. Somehow I missed that when I rode that Col in July. Hope your enjoying urself!
No, don't worry.. I don't want to put my legs under the seat in front of me. Its a great place for that giant plastic box! @delta #fail
Awesome few days at home.  Back on the road... ATL-BCN. Hard to say bye to home this time of year.
@MatthewBusche I think you get to pull that card for at least a week. Nice work on the GT! See you in Denmark.
@larrywarbasse you know you love the south, man!  Athens off season!
Tweeting prior to 5am...serves the purpose of proving u are awake at such a ridiculous time and therefore excused from afternoon krankyness
North american race season DUN. Its been awesome racing on the home continent! Quick stop at home, then another month across the pond. Shew!
Thursday night and quebec city seems to be bumpin. Maybe another entry for the "places to return to when not racing" list?
I suppose it was bound to happen eventually but what is up w all the twitter-spam!?  who r the LAME-O's that spend time creating this stuff?
This is gonna blow your mind, but... I am wearing a SWEATSHIRT in Athens, GA!  Talk about weird.
Its only taken 5+ months to deal with all the insurance/bills fallout from my collar bone, but I think its about done!
@larrywarbasse oh RHUBARB! That's why you like it!  Good luck man!
Honored to be named to worlds team and super pumped about the guys we have! USA names full World Championships squads http://t.co/K2jnccf"
BIG congrats to my pre-wife @Jamiedinkins on presenting/defending her graduate thesis. super happy to have been there for it! #smartypants
@DeeDee315 looks fun! Wish I could have joined you guys!
This race rocks..."@thachad: Mac and cheese, prime rib, and live country music for dinner! Only in America! Good stuff!"
This race is shaping up to be a brute but I'm still enjoying CO. Amazing USA fans (thank U!), plush hotels + visits from the fam = :)
"I feel funny" -@thachad http://t.co/WJxbkxZ
Congrats to @ghincapie! Big class, BIG win!
@sitdowninfront thank u!
@Perryguitar666 thanks man!
@Jeremysshaffer thanks man!
@chsdawg thank you!
@DivasTourFrance thanks!
Happy to put together a decent tt and get back on "the box". Big thank you to the staff @BMCProTeam for the meticulous prologue-work!
"Downhill" does NOT equal easy. What a lung buster! Hard to comprehend my heart beating 204 times in a minute.
@DivasTourFrance cool! Wish I was there. Howd jamie do?
Big weekend for my home city/cycling crew in Grand Rapids, MI. Hard to miss! Good luck to everyone there.
Last full day in amazing summer-time Park City. I'm disgusted and disturbed to report that I logged 0 hrs on the incredible MTB trails here
@flahute @notagaper @emerson_801 @podiuminsight that was a good slice o pie. Pic anyone?!?!
@dinkdinkdinkdin welcome to twitter! You are very hip-to-the-groove!
Another @tourofutah in the books. Awesome race,  BIG THANK YOU to those who made it happen and those who came out to yell for us.
HOTTT, salty, dry, uncontrolled and SKETCH at end. Nice work by @louderjeff sprinting in top 10 and snatching his home state jersey.
Getting stories from @TrudiLR about "bike check" today.  apparently "add a water bottle" was the remedy for a bike too light. Nice!
Happy to be back in utah.  Hit the ground running. Nice team pres. Last night, interview w @joelfelicio today and a ride w the boys. Hottt!
Wouldn't want to get too comfy.  Back on the road and into the air today. Nice time of year to be up in dem utah mtns.
somethings gotta give at some point I guess.  checking off the last item in my post-tour checklist... Antibiotic carpet bomb!
I'm a fan of keeping things clean, but passports are one thing that don't need to be washed. Still dealing w fallout from that slick move.
@jpmurph8 I think that's murphy's law man
@RobertGiannini huh? Speak english mane!
Getting smacked in the face by reality after having my life on hold for the past month. Spain is not home.
I've never been "down under" but after feeling the aussie-love the past few weeks I am thinking I must go! Thanks guys!
Biznass class on our Qatar airways flight to Paris. A little leg room after 3 weeks in the cave doesn't hurt.  Yellow-bonus!
WOW WOW WOW!! Speechless.  Yes!
@DivasTourFrance thanks for all the support the past 3 weeks. Missed seeing you on the road!
2.5 hrs in car, 5 min warm up and blind run on a wet course... Relieved to be DUN and have no pressure today. Super demanding course.
@fcbrian funny how u don't feel the wind from inside the car
Tour de France has turned into "tour de Traffic" the past 2 days. Almost 2 hrs into our 60 km transfer. Gonna be cutting it close for start
Driving down the Alpe on way to Grenoble. Impressive aftermath from the hoards of people yesterday!  I'm sensing a few hangovers?
Hope everyone enjoyed that! Just now crawling out of the "box" where I spent 2days stage.  @CadelOfficial =  VIKING from another dimension.
Stage 17... Making my tweets an accurate reflection of my mind... BLANK!__________________________________________
If your riding the Tour and don't have an ulcer after today, I'm impressed.  Second rest day tmrw! Whew
Thanks for putting me back together! "@Dr_Jardine: Spidertech at the tour http://bit.ly/p3FAqW"
If France had 2 legs, I would give the country a big KICK between them, just to keep things even. 50 kph wind today.
Stage 14...Deep into the desert. Time in bus, Big. Amount of climbing, BiGGER.  Predicted Madness factor, BiGGEST.
@mikefriedman2 hang tough man!
@thearamD race food(pasta pasta pasta)&lt;moe's(welcome to moe's!)&lt;qdoba&lt;chipotle
Not usually a huge soccer fan, but feel like I have a bit of my own skin in the game given current situation. women's USA-France. Goal USA!
@ghincapie @craiglewis85 u guys need to get out and ride some REAL MTB trails! If u dare?
@Perryguitar666 first the hamburger and now this! You are evil!
Last week it was the toothpaste incident. Starting this week off w another..Ice bag on shoulder/hips leaks all over bed. Watts-4-IQ trade!
A truly restful rest day! @TrudiLR taking care of the legs and a hair-cut by @Chrissoigneur. There r however a lot of flies in this hotel!
Thank you to Micky Schar for staying w me today when I crashed, smacked my head and was not in a good way. MVP
Insane and absurd by definition. Did we learn nothing from the giro? Crashing and mayhem playing bigger factor than sport. Very frustrated.
@Perryguitar666 dude that is just cruel! Do one for me too!
@EastsideChiroDC nice Dave! That will look GOOD in the office!
Last chance  http://t.co/DV9agoi #irideforthekids
Every TDF stage that I ride gives me a deeper + greater appreciation for any GC guy/team who puts it together (w/luck) for a full 3 weeks.
Professor Morabito studying away... Never a "routine" stage http://yfrog.com/kgjnqlbj
If you were to genetically engineer a champion cyclist, make sure to add the gene which causes them to desire pasta for breakfast. Barf!
6 days in...Just got in elevator up to 1st floor...looking for my ground-floor room. Starting to blurrrr already.
@podiuminsight disgusting eh?  Clowns in the circus.
ahhh yes...that was the absurd and excessive Tour that I've been dreaming of. This part of France would maybe be fun if you drive a go-kart
Still "stuck" in northwest France for stg 5...On bus. My pre race work station and seat buddy Micky http://yfrog.com/h3w1xkoj
@AshleyTravieso gotta rep the ATH! Tell everyone "hi"
@Cat237 cool thanks!
Was just informed by my french room mate that in this part of france, it rains 300 days per year. Surprise! Today is one of them!
Another very Tour-ish day here in France. Fried a few more nerves but stayed outa trouble. Big congrats to Tyler on stage win. 4th of July!
Hot dogs, fireworks, sun burn, beers...May get one out of 4 here at #tdf. Happy 4th USA. Proud to be here in France w such a solid USA group
Cant get more violent + intense than that. physical + mental blitzkrieg. Can someone pick up the pieces of ourselves we left out on course?
One day into #tdf and I've already dropped my toothpaste into the toilet. No idea how. This could get ugly.
That was a nervous and nutso 2nd half of the stg. Tires sliding more than wheels rolling. happy we all stayed safe. BOSS finish by Cadel!
I went 6 months without seeing the vampires..Show up to TDF and already twice in 3 days! I am not a morning person
Thank you everyone for the @'s, well wishes and good lucks!  Extra meaning to an extraordinary event
Looks like even the journalists are ready to get show on road...Lotsa ?'s bout other riders and other TDFs at BMC press conference.
gonna try  my best to keep http://t.co/DYCWioB updated... just for YOU!
Good catch-up w @SteveBlick. He's been hookin it up and helpin me out since my Team DEVO mtb days..from junior at sea otter to #TdF! MVP
Well into another jam-packed pre-#TdF day...Interviews, course reco, press conference + lock down final details. Some new sweet gear too!
In the holding tank before team presentation... http://yfrog.com/gye56gpj
Not the usual seat I have on my way to a bike race, but I'll take it. Thanks @BMCProTeam  #tdf http://yfrog.com/kfcjadj
The #TDF circus begins a day early... flights for just about every rider on our team are already cancelled for tomorrow!
Congrats to my buds @robgiannini + @ParkerSmith for finishing the #tourdivide !! About same distance as TDF on MTB.. Self supported! Boom!
Just did 4 weeks of whereabouts updates for TDF. First 5 days in none other than Frances finest...Campanile. Short straw!
@Perryguitar666 saw the video of you guys performing.. epic crowds!  take care man, good meeting you.
@chsdawg yes, lame. @Sevenpelicans is the best I've found so far. Thanks Jackson!
Looking for live report for USA women's RR nationals.. Anyone!?!?
@dleehoss things coming along here. Crazy we are a week out. See you again in france? Sounds like the book is a hit?
Nice ride w good (fast) company today. Happy to check the stelvio off my "must see" list. http://yfrog.com/gzvamrhj
@DivasTourFrance good. Thanks for checking. R all of u in augusta this wknd?  Cheer for jamie for me if u r!

@docmajor happy birthday!
@TheAramD dude Wildman! MVP. Baldwin
Psycho cyclone hurricane conditions out on the tt course this morning. Gonna be a crazy race today. Surprise!
Our hotel for today is weird. This begins to explain it... http://yfrog.com/h21jxaqj
Feel terrible for Soler,  his family and team mates.  I so badly wish incidences like these were not part of our sport.
Team crash (3 of us), team chase (7 of us) and team (most of us) in grupetto. Mattias saves the day w an amazing final climb! Killa!
GRIMselpass and GROSSe Scheidegg at Suisse today. Hoping it won't be too "grim" and "gross"!
First big day at tour de suisse, where every stage is the "queen stage". http://yfrog.com/kj8d0bj
Thunder rumbling here in lugano. Long afternoon of wating for my 6 pm start for the tt today.
@CovenantSport haven't forgot about your ?'s. Maybe send me your email through the contact page on my website?
@stacherchick sounds like I'm otb but.. Happy Birthday!
@manuelquinziato let me guess... That one was from KK!?!?
Help!!  Anyone in Girona have a spare set of speedplay pedals.. 53mm axle?!
en route to Girona  w @ghincapie. Experiencing the travel day trifecta.... Hungry, Tired, Mean.
@jaytrevaskis yea... U could have them tweet me or post them on my facebook fan page?
A productive 150 km on the tt bike w @BMCProTeam. After mondays race, travel and a bit of jetlag its safe to say I'm krispy krusty...tired
@nealrogers or a reminder of how much you pay them, and how little they give back to you. Punks.
Oops, make that 9 years ago. Dang, I'm getting old
Back in the Belge and headed to Zolder, the location of my first Euro experience 8 years ago. jet-lag was same then as it is now. Yaawwn
@Chrissoigneur see you soon buddy
Final few hours in the good ole USA before back across the pond. Its been great to be in the south and Greenville. Thanks again folks.
Proud to be part of @BMCProTeam. (Riders + staff)and how we rode today. Thanks to everyone for the cheering + support out there. Feltthelove
# 13 for tomorrows race. Straight up or upside down?
@DivasTourFrance awesome! Thanks for the updates!
@DANIALEicecycle used the #icecycle (2 of them!) to stay cool during my warm up yesterday, thanks!
@DivasTourFrance thanks! You ladies are great. Appreciate the support.
Thanks to all the family, friends and strangers who cheered me on 2eday. Bummed w end result. Likely only 1 guy who is psyched w his ride
TT course recon w the champ @taylorphinney. Thanks for the tips T!  nice to see the sun come out for a big weekend in Greenville
Very bummed to hear @craiglewis85 crashed hard at Giro.  Thinking of you and sending recovery wishes Craig.
@TimmyRRoe I think "Fairy" sounds way more fun. But don't forget about the gnomes and trolls as well.
over in greenville, in May?! Met up w @BMCProTeam and a clutch visit to @EastsideChiroDC. if @taylorphinney ever wakes up we can go ride.
@DivasTourFrance nice pic!!!
Back to the south after an enjoyable week in cali. Love the chance to race in USA. Great courses and awesome fans. Thanks #ATOC
@rsicchitano good thing we are on the same team eh?
@jakerytlewski I think almost everyone is lucky a move went before that climb, eh? Woulda been massive carnage.
@jeredgruber r u kidding me?
@iamtedking but its a USA edition of ground hog day! One where u get cookies in races!
That was a GnarGnar day. Big thanks 2 @louderjeff & team 4 help w my 2 wheel changes. Lights out on last climb 4 me. GH and Morabito studs
@DivasTourFrance as always.. Thanks so much for the support! Special to hear my name shouted when hurting.
Getting hit by the usual second day soreness but lookin forward to a big day in the mtns, excited to see the So. Cal. crowds.
@IamAuntieEm thanks for the cheering!
@fitzalan_gorman nope not ideal. Was sore and a little more tenative than usual in the corners. Trying to look forward tho!
Felt like a different rider compared to last time I did the solvang tt, but still a ways to go. Tomorrow looks to be a big'un!
@TheAramD cruising into your hood. See you out there tomorrow?
@ajmiac hey man, u ok? Sounds like we are at least better off than your bro.
@podiuminsight thanks.. Too bad it was too little too late and no one in the 2nd group had any interest in chasing. Frustration
Feeling stiff and krusty. Thanks to @Dr_jardine for the spider-tech love.
Bloody, sore and lost time, but I think I'm ok. Just very frustrated. Team rode great today.
A big sarcastic "thanks" to the leopard rider who was going backwards and crashed me as he hand-slung someone w 5 km to go. Hands on bars!
Great to be back racing in the homeland and seeing some chalk-love on the road!
@DeeDee315 thanks! I'll be keepin my cross eyed/blurred vision open for it!
Good to be racing again and thru the first one back. We all stayed outa trouble and @taylorphinney up in the top 10 w some fast company.
More stunning scenery from bus instead of bike. Shame it didn't work out but..On with the show #ATOC http://yfrog.com/h7121gdj
@HerriottSP where's the closet?
USA race = internet = updates this week over at http://www.brentbookwalter.com/  use it or lose it right?
School snow-days r way more fun then a "possible" bike race snow day. Looking like skipping the pasta this morning was good choice?!
Rode out to see finish of tmrws stage... A nice uphill altitude "puke-fest style finale" http://yfrog.com/h4k5oahj
Cattle drive (cyclists=cattle) up to Tahoe in our temporary team bus. Feeling the mountain town vibe http://yfrog.com/h78ohedj
Up and at em today, made it to airport about the same time sun was coming up. Home country race but still a solid travel day.
@jaytrevaskis sorry to hear. Take advantage of the time away from the bike. Hard to stomach I know but you will be stronger when back!
@jaytrevaskis one week post surgery on trainer. 10 days or 2 weeks outside. U have surgery?
Thanks guys. Any bit of denial I had going for me regarding the weather in Tahoe is now gone.
celebrating 6 weeks post collar bone surgery with some packing for TOC. Hair dryer hot in GA but word is to pack the winter gear?!?!
Nice to start the day seeing team mate Martin Kohler taking the bull by the horns
Happy Mothers Day, Mom!  and to all the other mom's out there. We would all be a mess without you.  ok, maybe even more of a mess.
Big congrats to my fiancee @Jamiedinkins on winning the Georgia State Criterium Champs! Solo!
Crazy to watch the Giro today and reflect on the past year. Excited to follow @BMCProTeam the next 3 weeks
@EastsideChiroDC didn't even know you guys were on twitter! Glad to know!
@troutbumtodd likewise. Thanks for the support!
Solid day all around. @BMCProTeam rollin in romandie, @louderjeff and family w new baby boy Jai! and me some nice training w @cbutler88
@TheAramD sprouted!?  Alive!?  PROTEIN 4:9!!!!!!
Made trip over to Greenville 4 ride today. a lot to like about the riding here, including getting smacked around by @ghincapie. #backatit
To clarify... I meant "from a hose" when I said church water stops. But now that I think about it, maybe a lil holy water wouldn't hurt.
I think today counts as first summer ride of the year.  Salt stains on jersey and stopping at churches 4 emergency bottle fill-ups.
Good luck to @BMCProTeam at AGR tmrw! I will miss being there with them in the trenches, in a sick and twisted sort of way.
Congrats @larrywarbasse on the big result today!!  Really?  Yea! REALLY!

More big kid bike racing in Catalunya. Nice to b in the sun. Not so nice to be on my usual spring regime of bronchitis and now antibiotics.
A few more familiar roads as we drive to stg 3 start, then its into unknown territory. Hoping Andorra has less pollen than girona. Aachooooo
@BGreene1 yeaaaa! Grand Rapids!  Will always be home.

Back to sunny Girona after a nice week of racing in Sardinia to kick open '11. Wishing @Jamiedinkins was still here!
Still not used to the hazard of team cars driving up into the pack during the race due 2 no radios. A danger entirely avoidable with radios.
Aside from the double flat when attacks were flying and ensuing chase, that was a relatively  enjoyable day in the Sardinian sun.
@louderjeff your back!?!?  You have a lot of bragging, self-promoting, complaining, and training log tweeting catching up to do.
Wouldn't be an Italian race without transfers...next up, transfer to dinner. Maybe take a mule or yak that belongs to the hotel we are at
@kimcando sorry guys, for sure wasn't me but thanks for the shout! I believe santa was our best today
I feel OLD. My room mate @cbutler88 rollin around in a high school homecoming t-shirt. http://yfrog.com/h0tmfoj
Doozy of a day in sardegna. There's some mtns on this island. And also hotels without heat. Glamorous.
@Ritannette1 of course. Just a few of many reasons why we need them!
@tomgakes at least we would have the option! With a poor race book we r totally racing blind unless u are from the area of the race
I'm still calling "redonk" on the no radios. flooded roads, construction zones out of the blue. We need better race books if radios r out.
And... we're racing. BoomBoom Ballan w a nice 2nd on the stage. Good to make it thru day 1 of the season. Little rain but sardegna is nice.
Pasta for breakfast, a little hotel "stink-eye" and a set of these can only mean one thing... http://yfrog.com/h64ubwj
Off Sardegna for some racing!  Dang, last race of last season was a long time ago!
what a difference 24 hours can make. on the UP! Good luck to @BMCProTeam in Oman and Italy today! wish I were there with them.
@taylorphinney yea man.. Maximum suck! Way to roll it in Oman! The reports from u guys r making me wanna race!

just had the privilege of starting a neighborhood "man-challenge" 2nites edition..5k run race while carrying a cinder block. oh to be young
@JohnSantos7 2011?  more bike racing!!
@Jules_Martinez YES!  I'd like to think so!
@svictoria29 Awesome, Congrats! honored to have been an inspiration for the 2 wheeled life.
Dreamy temps, blue skies, green trees and black pavement... Can you dig?

hey @velonews !! how bout an updated homepage pic!?
Good things happening to Great people.. CONGRATS @louderjeff on a HUGE hometown win. No one wanted it or deserved that more than him.
@ScottNydam uhhhh, u r blowing my mind. U know I'm just a simple boy.

@ScottNydam oh nydam. I miss ur unsarcastic sarcasm! How am I supposed to know what u mean without u being here?
Once again @taylorphinney layin it down while the rest of us fight for scraps, that guy can ROLL. Lotsa hype over tmrws crit... BIG day?!?!
@podium_live thanks for the updates and times. The race should hire you to double as reporter/official.
More importantly... Where was the the giant-hair-covered-wookie-like-creature handing out dollar bills yesterday?!?! Bring him back.
Enjoyin speaking english, burritos, BIGhotelBeds & laid back vibe, but no-radios, no-tt course recon & some of the officating seems silly.
One of the best parts about being back in the USA.... Post-race BURRITO!!!!!! http://myloc.me/aJa4F
And.... We're racing! Good to be back at tour of utah. I was no match for the young guns tonight. Looking forward to good ole BIG mtn tmrw.
Faast! RT @johnlelangue: Great work of @BMCProTeam at Vattenfall in Hamburg. @Kristoff87 4th behind Farrar, Boasson Hagen and Greipel. Nice!

Nothing like some Goergia summer heat and humidty to smack the jet-lag outa you. Good to be back.
No, 1000 Delta dollars won't keep me in Spain another day. When you are ready to go home, you just gotta get there.
@iamtedking Joe Dirt said life was a garden?
Taking the train from Barcelona-Girona the day after the TDF.... Worst idea ever.
@Cyclocosm true dat! Thanks to them all!
Smiles... http://tweetphoto.com/34896449
Made it.  http://tweetphoto.com/34888806
Already been a long day of bus, train and more bus. Finally rolling up to todays start. Valued.
Glad to get thru that. 52 km flat, straight on the tt bike=serious torture. Feels like I have a giant sword stuck in my glutes. 1 to go
@DivasTourFrance thanks for the cheering!
Me too!RT @ghincapie: I think I counted every k of the stage today. Seemed to have lasted an eternity. I'm ready for Paris.
TDF "double jeopardy (sp?)"... The 3rd week when the km's on the bus and on the bike all seem to count for double.
Too tired for coherent tweeting. 3 more days.
@DivasTourFrance sounds like a good spot for a BIG push! See u then!
"I'm sorry man, I'm just not tired, first time in 9 grand tours"-KKroon in response to me whining about how wrecked I feel after the restday
RT @Mickeyhavoc: Och wins the rest day Toblerone for weathering all the attacks the team laid down on him today http://twitpic.com/27d5n6
http://tweetphoto.com/34035104 had a good catch up w long time friend/sponsor kevin cusack. Would not b here (cont) http://tl.gd/2li943
Killer ride by Alle Ballan for the runner up spot today. Anyone that got into that break was a hauss. Ouch filled day 4 me. Feeling Tworked.
Just like the stages and profiles that get harder during the third week at the TDF, so do the transfers. Clowns in the circus.
@STEVENCOZZA I don't know or care, I just want a good one!
Finally caught the sweet dice roll w the hotel situation. 2 suitcases fully opened, a/c, no mold carpet, 2 pillows/bed, livinlargeinfrance!
Glad to hear I wasn't the only one who found today to be a tad challanging and uncomfortable. I'd dare to call it crazy-blitzkrieg-HARD.
BIG day of racing and pre/post race transfers at the TDF today. Going old school 2 the start w the cars so the bus can beat us to the finish
Krsuty and stiff this morning, here we go for another. Middle of the TDF desert, already been racing 4 ages but the end is not yet in sight
@Mickeyhavoc bb-2. Don't diss me like that.
Forgot how much it sucks to hit the ground at 50 kph. Missing half a butt-cheek & wicked sore neck, but think I'm ok. Never a dull moment.
Not too shabby... http://tweetphoto.com/32271305
Blood test to start the "rest" day. Always sure to include mass amounts of waiting while they fill out paperwork. No printer at the UCI?!?
That was a DAY. Added my name to the TDF crash-list. all ok tho. Cadel in yellow, WOW.  Ready for tmrws "rest" day.
RT @craiglewis85: Ricco crashes in the TT today, finishes covered in blood and possibly with a broken nose. #karma
Attack a fellow rider with your wheel and fists, and only get fined $400. That is weak. Hard to call that an accident. Only at the tour?
That was "uncomfortable" at best. I can't relate to all this talk of "resting" on sprint days. Felt like we were riding in an arm-pit today
@chrisbarton88 don't get me started, or u will be feeling like weiner.
@slctbird I'm gonna use this image for my "happy place" today. I'll be spending a lot of time there.
Saddle sores, sunburn and un-fresh legs. It must be around day 7. 230+km when u add in the neutral for today.
@cbutler88 dude. Seriously?
Dinner at the Tdf. The cycling world comes to France, and most teams bring their own cook. Yes, in france.   http://tweetphoto.com/31514701

@barongrutter Amen man, glad to hear! 115kg eh? Maybe soaking wet with lead boots on. More like 70kg these days. Take care!
@anitabfranklin thanks for the support!
Late start and sure to be a hott one for our first full day in France.  Hoards of people at todays start.
@barongrutter thanks for the shout! Its cool to finally be in a race that more people can relate to. How have yoiu been? Hope all is well.
@Sevenpelicans http://tweetphoto.com/31164143 enjoy the high life.  we are in a campanile. Jerk.
Glad that one is DUN! Is it humanly possible to enjoy riding on cobbles? Good day for the team, cadel up to 3rd overall. Finally in france!
@mekprut not sure?! I felt terrible today so was just fighting to stay w the yellow group. Finally caught my breath and realized no racing.
What was that? Somehow I managed to escape the mass carnage 2day. Maybe the most guys I've ever seen on the ground. All bmc's ok I think
WOW! Now I'm beginning 2 understand all the fuss about the TDF. never seen so many ppl, ever, anywhere. A tunnel of noise and colors ALL DAY
Sad to be heading to stage 1 without Mattias. Looks like a nice day to get things going, sunny!
@dbjcyclist thanks! Its been a long road. Great to be here.
Thanks for all the support and well wishes! Woulda been nice to have been a half-second faster, but gave all I had. Hoping mattias is ok.
@svictoria29 whoa, long time no talk! Thanks for the shout! Yes, you were right. Thanks for all the encouragment back then. Hope all is well
@lucaseuser ha! I assumed u were already on the list. My bad man.
Start time 4 tomorrow 4:24 pm. First rider off for the team.  Seems like the wind will play a more important role than the dry/wet factor
Back in bus for the hour+ drive 2 hotel after a few quick laps on the prologue course. Fast, lotsa pedaling and time in the bars, windy.

6 tubes of blood to the uci yesterday, and another 2-tube test today. Racking up those passport stamps.
Made it to Holland. Doing a little hotel room furniture re-arranging to make this pint sized room live-able for the next couple days.
On my way to Rotterdam. The craniness is ramping up already.  Lucky I got out the door on time after a hefty blood donation to the UCI.
Quiet sunday in Girona. Fighting off jet-lag with both fists.  http://myloc.me/8uNyi
How do I know I'm back in Spain? There is a giant, chaotic blob of people in "customs" where there should be a line. Hola.
Feeling the love. Thanks everyone! Another fine case of the less-than-expected turning into reality.      http://myloc.me/8ptCD
@andrewtalansky thanks man. I think the congrats r in order to u! Sweet ride yesterday!
@aramdellalian thanks man! Think we can export something from the caf?!?
@wesko whoa, easy. Maybe I should re-word..."game" meaning a light- hearted way to describe the sport/world of cycling that we obsess about
Afternoon productivity thrown in toilet by 90-minute Usada visit. Yes, part of the game.
Just got a nice care package from @FirstEndurance to help keep me going my last few days in the states. Cranking thru the EFS in this heat!
@jeredgruber to each his own I suppose.  you could do some research and count each tdf contenders "race-days" going into the tour.
@jeredgruber no racing in CO dude.
@andrewtalansky just think how the guys felt who did NOT WIN the morning stage. Dang dude, nice work. U r on a roll.
Sounds like nasty conditions across the board in euro bike races lately. I'm putting in an official request 4 things 2 stabalize by nxt week
FREE mosquitos in my back yard!  seriously, come take as many as you want.  I'm feeling generous today.
all sports seem to be having issues these days...http://www.theonion.com/articles/new-york-marathon-winner-tests-positive-for-perfor,2845/
Wow what a disgusting looking crash at suisse. Its amazing u have 2 want it "that bad" 2 win 1 of those sprints. #lowbodyvalue hopeall r ok
there's no place like home. although i could do w/out the mega swamp-ass-inducing heat/humidity.  Good luck to the guys who start Beace 2day
@scotttemplar whoa, thanks for the heads up, Scott! I'll have to make sure "mom" gets that issue. Hope all is well w guys.
@andrewtalansky dude?!? U r killing it. Congrats, keep it up.
Not sure if its post-giro haze, or maybe the cumulative 9 hrs of sleep over 2 nights, but I feel like I got hit by a truck. Usa bound 2day!
@mirothecyclist thanks Miro! Yes, I remember riding w u and matt a couple years ago, good times. Hope all is well w u. Thanks for the shout
whew buddy.  back to girona.  3 hours of sleep is not enough for the first night after a 3 week race!
Solid dinner in Verona w the team & all the crew of @BMCProTeam who made the past 3 wks happen. Thank you! Couldn't have survived w/out u.
Thanks to everyone for all the support the past 3 weeks! Peaks, valleys and everything in between, great to have a good crew help me thru!
Giro 2010 & my first grand tour in the books! Nothing magical 2day, but very happy to be here in Verona. Now to watch @CadelOfficial rip it!
That was HUGE!. All capitals don't do it justice. Bonkers nutso unreal redonk bigness. One more stage to go! http://myloc.me/7A76s
Stg. 20. In the words of @iamtedking ..VERY "GIRO" http://twitpic.com/1s2m2m
@JohnSantos7 ha. Those don't exist here. Really.
My race book says 140 km for today? Surely, that's a lap, that we do twice?  This is the GIRO afterall.
Sleep-in on a rest day? Naaa. I'd rather wake up and give my blood to the uci. Iamarobot.
Finishing off this giro "week" in fine giro-style. Brute of a stage and a few hours of leg-fixing fun in the car. Rest day tmrw!
Undecided if it was a good thing to have seen "Zoncolan" b4 we go up it in the race. At least I know 2 bring a climbing harness and rope.
Giro freak-fest-2010 continues today.
@andrewtalansky wow dude. Nice one!
@_Fred_Marx_ good point! I'm still running off morale from that care package. Down to fumes tho!
@BMCProTeam what?! That's cruel. I want one.
Flatted w 20 km to go and couldn't get back. Bummed I wasn't there when I hear about the B.S. that was going on. Stopthemadness!
These "rider-race-radios" sure are making for predictable, boring races. (Insert massive sarcasm here).
"Its a new giro"?!? Did those guys miss the part about my legs and body being as far away from "new" as they've ever been? Whatthecrap?
One would think waiting 15 min For next group would provide some rest. Not if u r soaked and its freezing. Deepdeep into the cave. Redonk
@TwoWheelTweets no amount of time loss can equate to the bodily suffering. Get with it.
Random drug control after race, stuck at finish before 2 hr transfer. Keeps geting better http://twitpic.com/1p6076
Hands down, without a doubt the most miserable day ever experienced on a bike.
Do not fear... I am a robot.
That was fast. & wet. & way fast, and really wet. Glad to know our BMC's are just as good going thru standing water as they r on pavement.
Can't hurt... http://twitpic.com/1oe74b
@analogula thanks. I think?
Another day in the Giro, never a dull moment. 4 tmrw, we all go face to face, put our hand in a flaming fire, first one to pull away loses.
RT @iamtedking: To the armchair quarterbacks looking 2 critique 2day's stage: don't. 2day raised the bar to the cycling standard of misery.
Woke up today and remembered it was saturday. That's a good start... The part about me knowing what day of the week it is.
Yes, still alive and still kickin. I'd say that qualified as an "eventful" day. Glad that Mickey and Flo are ok after hitting the pavement.
For some "southeast" perspective... 2day we do 2 climbs similair to "Roan Mtn." And its NOT considered a "mountainous" day. Whew buddy.
Big "thank you" 2 the wind for blowing at our backs for a good chunk of the day. Made it over the first small "hills" of the race. More tmrw
TTT.. One of the rare days where u ride fast in a group but no one is intentionally "flicking" each other.
Spot on so far..RT @analogula: @brentbookwalter, Giro tires you, then makes you stupid,then Peleton feeds on weakness,descents into narrows
Good time to adopt the atkins diet. dinner put on by giro organizers and they run out of pasta. Giro. Fail.
RT @louderjeff: Landed and walked straight into a giant tent full of enthusiastic Italians. The real Giro starts now. http://mypict.me/6V06a
Usually when I say "traveling circus" I'm half-joking. This time, Its literal. 2 hour bus, 2 hour flight, and an authentic italian welcome.
@analogula first 2-wheels r dangerous, eh?
@_Fred_Marx_ I hope man. The only piano I've seen so far is the one that was dropped on me today.
2.5 hrs riding tempo + 2.5 hrs slammed in the gutter = 2 totally smashed legs. How many days to go? Ifeellikeimtakingcrazypills.
Good morning day 3. Leave your logic, reason and "value for your body" at the stage start, u won't need it... 1 more stage in Holland. #giro
Me too! Thankmyluckystars RT @louderjeff: In honor of Mothers day, I chose not to crash today. Mom, it wasn't easy, but I did it for you.
Absolute insanity. Ridiculous. So many crashes today. Sorry to hear team mate martin went down hard. On the UP... Cadel in Pink.
Wow. Once again, totally speechless. So thankful to make it thru that unscathed. On the other hand, mind blown to have missed pink like that
New jersey for tmrw. Not pink, but red looks better w the BMC colors ;) http://twitpic.com/1m6500
Wow, feelin the LOVE! Thanks everyone! Proud to be a part of this team and honored to recieve all the kind words.
@taylorphinney thanks dude! Trying to keep up w all u young guys who have been layin in down!

http://twitpic.com/1jfgdc - 5 of 6 ppl at this table are italian. one guess who #6 is? Another fab view tho!
Correction! 5 of 6 speak italian fluently.  Twitter foul.
If I told you what gearing I rode today, and how much time I spent in said gear, you wouldn't believe me. So I won't even bother ;)

Stage 1 done and all BMC'ers A-ok. Cold and wet out there.  A little disturbing to think that was supposed to be an "easy, flat" day.
On top of telling them where I am, everyday, USADA is asking me 2 tell them what exact hotel room I am gonna be in? #INeedAcrystalBall.
@iamtedking I've done that stage finish before. Sometimes they also add aliens w lazers and archers w toxic arrows. U know, for sport.

Noteable moment of yesterday, season and career...Getting a wheel FROM the World Champion. Thanks @CadelOfficial! Will pay that back in May
Tour de Tuscany 2day as we look at  Giro stage 7 over more "white roads". Looks like a brute of a finale. Nice cafe stop to let it sink in.
Eroica is a crazy but cool race! One for the future I hope. Felt solid out there. Gave my wheel to Schar during "go-time", that was it 4 me.

$250 in bags, one BIG burrito and the usual h20 stock up later and I'm on board and set to go. Nice sunset to see me off.
A bike, 2 large bags, backpack and carry-on. What kinda damage can I expect on Luftansa?  I mean, to the wallet.

Been talkin quite a bit w my future euro-roomie @iamtedking about my impending spanish arrival. Nice to have eyes, ears and feelers on scene
If a BIG training ride is black, and a short easy ride is white.  I'm not a fan of "grey" rides.
wham bam day of WBL. What other group ride stacks 100+ riders, sag support, prize money and loaded prize box. ATH doin it right!

Last ride of training camp today. Its been a packed but productive couple of weeks.

Another day of solid team riding and transfer training. This is the cali we've been lookin for.
Solid day RT @larrywarbasse: view from the start of our ride today.175 K down hwy 1. Some pretty nice scenery http://tweetphoto.com/9531386
@_Fred_Marx_ 2.5 hour holding pattern quickly turning into 3.5 hrs. Abort mission. Reset.
notifying a rider for testing at 7 am, and then not allowing them to provide a sample until 9:30? Negligence.
Morning drug testing c/o UCI... NOT a streamlined process.  On a happier note, looks to be a nice day in Monterey.
Anyone doing live updates from the WBL today in the ATH?  There have to be at least a few media cars on the caravan
Insert body in ice bath, splash cold water on face, hold breath, punch legs. Repeat to simulate the ride we did 2day. No need 2 leave home!
This is not the cali that they wrote all the songs about. More rain and a balmy 38 degrees.
at training camp and we are once again awake before the sun comes up. This time for UCI blood/urine donation. Corework, ride up next.
First day at team camp. Woke up BEFORE my alarm. Gotta love west coast time. Bout to get down on some core w @herriottsp
Spent a night in the ATL en route to training camp. More proof that I am NOT a big city guy.
Bam! I like it RT @FirstEndurance: 1st Endurance sponsoring BMC in 2010.  More details coming soon.

@larrywarbasse u can eat it rawwwww dude. Update ur bio, ur a bmc'er now. C u at camp, right?
Training camp just around the corner... Can we request a week of those record warm temps like last year, please?
No doubt it is soup season

Put my frame pump in one of my roof-rack trays when I put my bike on my car yesterday. 2 hrs of driving later and it was still there. Score!
@DeeDee315 you got it. Crisp and cold is actually kinda nice once I peel myself away from heated house and pot-o-coffee
trying to remember the days when I was a Michigander and "above freezing" temps was a balmy winter day
@louderjeff yes sir, that sounds correct.  You can also be sure that training hours are twice as effective when tweeted.  its science
Its been a while since I've been home long enough to use an entire thing of half-and-half before it goes bad. I just did it!  I like that.
@slctbird Thanks Burke!  I'll keep that one on standby.  Congrats on your gig for this season.  Sounds like a prime mix
Another cold morning.  searching for some motivational tunes to get me out the door.
@slctbird ditto. Maybe equally appalling is the "industry-politics-BS" behind it all. Nice to do what we do!
@jeredgruber 4000 words is about the same as 4000 kjs. Right?
Finally got around to watching "Food Inc." last night. Disgusting on multiple levels.
Cold and sastisfying day riding the roads thru the chattahoochie. A real shame tour of Georgia won't be around to use those roads this year
Back in the ath and digging the winter sunshine.  WBL this weekend?

The glamerous life of a pro cyclist...RT @KatieFnCompton: What's the point in having health insurance when it doesn't cover anything??
@louderjeff bingo. BIG winner. I figure 90 min late this time of year is about on time anyway. U havin good family/holiday time?
Those "through the airport", sub-6 min. miles always leave a mark the next day.
@Delta Thanks for another kick to the groin, Delta #deltasucks
Congrats! RT @jakerytlewski: http://yfrog.com/4isynaj
@podiuminsight standby for report. About to board first flight. 30 min late. 40 min layover in cinnc. Why am I even getting on this one?
I nominate @mikeyhavoc to regulate all timing in the airline industry. Certainly that is the only way to stop the madness. Not early=late
@louderjeff it kinda feels like I should have been there for that event. With two of us, we could have doubled the time it took to take down
Headed into the airport gauntlet. Hoping that recent events haven't added a 4th ring to the circus.
@iamtedking I was fairly sure you had to go all the way to quebec for that? Lotsa vibe
In my next life, I may live with 2 boards attached to my feet and spend my days floating down big snowy mountains.

@Sevenpelicans usada got me today. Have fun
off season has commenced.  sadly, the health factor is lagging behind. forcing me to do some "office work" before any real fun.

Transfering to franco-belge hotel. Someone in the states needs to wake up and tweet so I have something to read.
searching ebay for some pma. Figure if I found it today, I could have it by saturday.
Grey, fall day. Hoping the clouds can hold it in for the next 4 days.  30 days has september, that means tomorrow is October.

Congrats to Craig, Timmy, Peterson and Jason for finishing a truly brutal race. "That was the longest bike ride I've ever done"-Timmy
Dissapointed to say my day is done. Need a lot of work to go the distance. Made it to 4 to go and still 1 of my longest races of the year.
Thanks to team Columbia-HTC for letting us use their swank team bus today. Stylin. 1 hour till start. Breeeeaathe.
@bethleasure thank you!
Game day tomorrow. Winding it down and getting excited at the same time. Dreaming USA. However it unfolds, its great to be part of it.
@podiuminsight its a brute. Especially multiplied by 19. Very few places to recover and/or move up. Steep climbs. I'm riding a 27 cassette
@podiuminsight main pack down to 30 or 40. Small groups trying to go but nothing is sticking, yet. Sun is shining
Watching the U23 worlds on italian tv. Do these commentators ever breathe? One giant, 5 hour run-on sentance.
7 am wake up call for uci blood test this morning for all of team USA. Jetlagged, dazed and getting poked is not a gentle way to wake up.
You know its been a long season when I can't sleep ur first night in europe. That's supposed to be the easy one!
Sounds like Zirbel is in the hotseat for the Elite TT. Quite a few riders to go, but whatever happens, impressive euro debut!
Made it to Milan. Now if I can find the Dolce and Gabana show.
Sounds like new plane. Maybe 3+ hrs late when its all said and done. Not bad. They r giving us free juice and peanuts. Joy.
Well, that didn't work.  Cracked and broken windshield on plane. Were up in northern quebec and had to go back to NYC. Now what?!?!
Packed like sardines on the ATL-Milan flight. Lookin forward to a good stretch in 9 hours.
@DeeDee315 single prop 6 seater outa athens. Were gonna miss jeff. Not sure who or if they will replace him at all. Thanks for the shout!
Showed up to the athens airport 30 min b4 my flight. Was thinking that's a bit late. Turns out I still have a solid 25 min of waiting. Nice!
All this talk of vegas, flashy lights, grippin it rippin it and post season partying... I still have 3 weeks of my season left!
@JenniferChurch thanks! I'd love to revisit the east tenn cross scene. I still have another 3 weeks of road racing left, tho!
1:30 pm departure today. easing in2 the day watching the women's worlds tt.  weird to think that in 20 hours (i hope), I will be there too.
bummed to hear @louderjeff was struck by the H1N1 monster and will miss the last euro trip we have coming up.
"brown water coming from the sink is normal, healthy and just a result of system flushing" says the water company. brown=healthy? hmmm NO
The streets are flooding. Literally
@thomasfrei glad to hear you will be joining us! see u there.
6 am vampire encounter is not the best way to start the day. 4 out of comp tests in 4 weeks.  I must be peaking.
Not sure I can manage much more t"RAIN"ing. Counting down the days till Oct. 12.
Appears to be monsoon season in the southeast. Great for enhancing end of season training motivation.
not a big fan of doing group rides that end with an hour of riding "in the dark".  the group part is nice this time of year, though.
@JenniferChurch thanks!
Kinda like sticking ur hand in a fire and keeping it there, just for sport.
Rollin 9 deep in the van, for 2 hrs to start of stage 6. Nothing to lose after yesterday.
Its kinda like beating your head against the wall.  Missing pieces.
Tt course looks... Straight, straight and... straight. 30 km of in-the-aero-bars "fun".
Another "sprint-ish" day in MO. Louder took the bull by the horns w a nice daylong break. Did my best to help cruz in the sprint. Ended 9th
9/9/09.  I wonder if anyone has number 99 today?  Another day in the traveling circus. Missouri is not a flat state
Sitting and waiting for the bike racing to start.  Thinking about putting on my size XL Tour of Missouri t-shirt!

Back at it. Athens to atlanta to st. Louis.  Halfway, so far, ok.
Already missing mountains. Or maybe its just september. Or maybe both.
@louderjeff keep telling yourself its the last big training ride of the year.  and make me a latte.
some solid time behind the scooter and finished the ride with my first athens group ride.  pretty impressive turnout by my standards!
Never buy anything from @RoomsToGo
2nd time in the past week I've woken up to people at the door who want to watch me pee in a cup and take it with them.  c'mon in!
@iamtedking feelin you dude.  something has gotta be done.
Krusty morning, capital K.  sometimes 4th place feels like 3rd loser.  A few more days of settling into the ATH before heading to MO
Thinking what a bunch of great teamates I have. Was a lot of fun hanging and racing with our full American crew this weekend.
Late night drive home. Took a detour to pick up a craigslist buy and the d-bag never showed up.
Louder 3rd. Me 4th. Not what we wanted but left it all out there. Team rode great for both of us all day. Congrats to @ghincapie
Made it to greenville. The one team race of the year I can drive to. That'll help the happy leg cause.  Sunday sunday sunday
Finally was suckered into downloading the new ubertwitter. Filled with ads. Sighhh.
6 am pee and poke showdown with usada, C/O uci.  4 of them showed up. Didn't think I was that intimidating.
Settling into the ATH.  so far, so good.
@Sevenpelicans recover, travel, race, travel, recover, travel, race??  That's my top secret unsecret plan. What's the latest w/ C3?
Hello humidity. My lungs missed you.

Solid tt day for the team. Mccissick a close 2nd, louder 4th and now 2nd overall at 40 second back. Not my best ride (8), but on the up&up.
RT @louderjeff: Great racing 2day; every1 showed up to ball. All the BMC boys played a part & it more or less went to plan. BIG TT tomorrow.

@chrisbarton88 you west coast punks. I'm already 6 hrs into my trip and still have 2 flights to go. http://myloc.me/c3i8
@Sevenpelicans I think hiking boots would look great w dopo bici.  The kind you don't lace up and tuck your pant legs into.
Anarchy in Atlanta. The harsh truth that this will soon be my home airport is hitting me. PMA...time to start racin tomorrow!

@kmanderz what is all this PTC nonsense?  or maybe its complete sense.  but still, i don't get it
so humid that i need a set of gills to breathe.  just like cascade and utah, right?
Explored a few new roads today.  Its a good feeling when they turn into what's expected.  Last weekend at home for a while, gotta soak it up
@mryerson not that I know of?  Kinda doubtful.  What's he a doctor of? http://myloc.me/8Nnf
wondering if anyone has any intel on what the climb up "Fort Mtn" in Georgia is like? thinking of mixing up the training local this week.

@sevenpelicans Happy birthday!  you gonna bag a bday win a fitchburg, or you off racing till July?
U know its a good day when the gas station cashier calls u "sweety, honey, doll, baby and sweetheart" all in 1 visit. Maybe she's a bmc fan?

Camping, mtbing, extended family visit and a win for Jamie at the kenda cup east mtb race made it a bon weekend. Now to michigan.
Less than an hour of shirtless sun today and my shoulders are roached.  We did find some sweet trails in dupont state forest to make up 4 it
The southeast is a furnace right now. Road tripping and riding the mountain bike w jamie this weekend. Coming out of the jetlag haze.
@McFlash8 u guys are making me feel left out. Mccissick/louder withdrawel is hard enough as is. Enjoying the Mcgarnigal tweets, tho
@iamtedking upgraDDe?! With 2 "D's" for a double dose of your pimpness. Name that movie.
Feeling every minute of the 6 hour time difference. One more flight to go. As @louderjeff said...stage 9, possibly the longest of the week..
Dauphine dun. My first race thru the Alps. If "no pain, no gain" is true, I wil be doing some serious "gaining". Solid wk for team. Now home
Roasted, toasted and burnt to a crisp. In more ways than one. Rough day. Monstor climbs. On a positive note, rest of the team rode great.
Up the Izoard today. Another brute in southern france. A nice 3 hour drive to the Gap to get the legs warmed up. 108km @ warp factor 11.
I came, saw and was conquered by ventoux. Equally conquered by some nasty stomach issues. a beast of a mtn, tho. I race against aliens.
Here we go again. This time up. For 21 km at 8 percent., at the end of the stage.  I wonder what it feels like to play baseball for 5 hrs?
Same goes for me..RT @louderjeff: Wow, its amazing how hard you have to go to get schooled. I expect a few more lessons this week.
43 km of tt'ing today. There's a first time for everything. 90 min transfer to Valence for some recon. Gonna be a balmy one.
@Sevenpelicans congrats man! Sounds like you guys cleaned house.  Keep it up! Everyone here says well done.
danillow wyss wins beauce stage 1 ?!?! i heard.
@podiuminsight any composition info on the break or chasers?? We're in the dark over here
Another dauphine day dun. 5 man break stayed clear and yellow jersey changed hands. Zberg 9th on stg. "Small" climbs 2day. Long tt tomorrow.
Markus Zberg 2nd in dauphine stg 2! Long day, went smoothly. 2 rear flats and about 10 "nature" breaks for me, good teamates lookin out.
I see blue sky. And only a short drive to the stage start. So far, so good. Going to Dijon today. Maybe there will be a mustard prize there?
Thanks for all the @replies! Something about those violent, late afternoon efforts makes me less sleepy at night. Early start trow for 230km
@perrypaolini perry! Long time man. Thanks for the shout. Hope all is well on ur end. Itd be good to catch up sometime
Dauphine stg 1 dun. Tough course! Evans wins stage. I think I was 16th-ish?  Good example of tts not feeling good even when they go well.
RT @louderjeff: If you want to watch the Dauphine check www.steephilltv.com or www.cyclingfans.com. I predict a spectacle all week.
Tt course has it all.  3km climb out of the gate, crazy fast downhill, buncha corners and a few straightaways.  No lions or spike traps. Yet
As for me... Looks like 3 seperate bike rides today. Openers to say the least. Hopefully it will be dry for at least one.
"Don't go off firing bullets. Holster that sh*t and have the confidence you can be there at the finish"-sayers. Good luck to bmc philly guys
Thinking this weeks TT's will likely have more kms, climbing and cornering than all the american tt's that I will do this year combined.
@jtrubey ready to not be sitting in a hotel room waiting to race. That is for sure! Hope to do the southeast proud.
@aramdellalian when I was dead broke man I couldn't picture this
Studys show that weekends provide less email to American cyclists in euro hotels. What do you mean there are better things to do than txtme
Lettuce should precede veggies/toppings, should precede salad dressing in a salad bar. Logic, except in france.
@Garciasoup u r cruel, flaunting ur free internet while ur teamates fester in a rediculous world of over priced euro internet.
I've watched more tennis this week than during the rest of my life combined. Sadly, its all been in french. Not exactly therapeutic.
Another groundhog day in belgium.  Over the "between races hump".  Moving to Nancy, france tomorrow.
Enjoyed reading that @louderjeff is still ranked 5th in the NRC, after only one appearance at an NRC race this year, almost 2 months ago.
Big news of the day...installed new padding in helmet. About to do some belgian back road exploring w @louderjeff
Supposedly my tweets now tell people where I am? Test test. Nothing new to report here. Exciting day as a recovering bike racer
Lazy day in belgium. "Holiday" here which means everything is closed and the roads are packed with cars. BE didn't consult w me on that one.
Ubertwitter! So far so good. Even from belgium. Where I'm digging into an overcooked piece of cow. Good times w/ staff and team america
@AFCC @thachad from bmc for the win. Masters nationals was on the same course? Come on.
tour of BE dUn. good day for the team in the tt. 6 in the top 30. 13th for me, 19th overall. back to groundhog day at hotel nivelles sud.
that was sick and wrong.  i am knackered.
turned into a semi-pleasant day. great teamates brought me back after I flatted w 15k to go. thanks guys!
rings of fire, archers, a lion, a dragon, land mines and alien wizards. oh, and CROSS WIND. for most of the day by the looks of things.
@Garciasoup yea man.  all good here.  sorry for the confusion.  hope your slaying some kj's and climbs like what
if u put ur hand in a burning flame, it burns u. if u try to ride thru a human, u bounce off them. logic?, not here. happy to have my skin.
already had a random guy watch me change clothes this morning. seems to be part of being a cycling fan here.
good chunk of the day off the front, managed to hang onto the lead group when they were smashing away from the pack. legs feeling crispy.
learning about the gila monstor.  in german
waiting for tour of belgium team presentation. outside the trees are dancing. getting it out of their system for tomorrow
wondering what exactly makes up wireless web signal?in belgium, i think  little gnomes, carrying info back and forth? slow gnomes
@jakerytlewski living the AMERICAN DREAM!  take some pics of the spectators!
flemish speaking bike race announcers are not helping my "stay awake" cause
good morning belgium. not a bad flight. feeling the "lag". croissants and coffee while i wait for the other guys.
full flight. delayed on the runway. memorial day traffic. mindblowing how a 3day weekend causes so much travel. what would 2day holidays do?
living the airport dream. seat assigment for atl-bru reads "see gate agent". they must want to upgrade me. or stick me out on the wing.
thinking about getting the mopped chopped.  short is fast, right?
broke my rear derailur cable on my first effort of the day. i guess i needed an easy day on the mtb
maxing out my jamie time before saturday. perfect night to be enjoying the nooga of chatty.
went to a presentation about the american chestnut. yes, there was a girl involved in me going. yes, it was also interesting.
completed my NC high country adventure. love it up there.  rode all my fave climbs. thatll teach my legs a thing or 2
wondering how it went for the team at Picardie today.  As for me, I'm back in my old NC stomping grounds in search of a few bigger climbs
hoping this coke gives me the kick i need to get home.
peach of a day here in the southeast.  good to be getting some rhythm back on the road bike. lookin to hit dem hills this week.
coming out of the post euro trip haze. amazing summer weather is helping my cause. gonna banche the mtb this weekend.
2nd quarter uci blood test. never ceases to amaze the lab ppl. "you race bikes for a living? (insert wierd look here)"
ive been in the southeast for an hour and am already a snot factory

my 2nd romandie is a wrap. A tough one, but obvious team and personal improvments from last year. 18 hrs and i should be home!
sending recovery wishes to @SCottNYdam.
how does a 15km ttt equal 5 hous of chamois time?
romandie stage 2. ehhhh. moos 7th. ttt tomorrow.  just like the LMC days! i doubt ill be taking pulls like then.
read @nealrogers new article on www.velonews.com. finally someone presents the other side of the story. well put!
Nice work to the BMC guys at Gila!  100% of the team in the top 10.  riding aggressive in the break with only 3 guys in the race. hauss
stage 1 in the books. short but fast. no rain jackets! zberg 9th. full size day tomorrow.
@podiuminsight where's the love for @BMCProTeam !?!?
ok, that didnt work. stage 1 delayed and shortened due to snow. gonna be a fast, frantic one now. less than 100km
RT @louderjeff
romandie prologue done. 4 min. of lung busting blitz. cool course. went ok. not sure on results.
speechless about the new uci rule which will only let 3 riders from our team race at NRC races. LAME!! way to develop cycling.
the good news is that allergens dont usually live in clouds. bad news, i havent found where they are building the ark.
t-minus 23-26 hrs until prologue start. nothing like getting amped, slammin 3km and trying to go to bed a couple hrs later.
rode through "Brent, Switzerland" on our ride today. no joke. rooming with markus zberg this week.
2 hrs into the 8 hr drive to switzerland. luxembourg right now. its a prime day for twittering
