this hotel is nicer than the dump i was in last night.
@zzbbking one of the greats.
goodbye mac wiseman. you sir made great music! glen rose bluegrass fest mid 70's.
today would have been my mom's bd. she was born in '26 and grew up on a sharecrop and picked cotton and corn etc in the central texas heat on black dirt.
we lost a good guitar man in josh haddix. good ol' NC boy. met him with bad livers in early nineties.
we have a good local jazz station and the local barber has it on in his shop
the interdebt.
josh was driving the van when i got my old dog skillet.
aw man we lost a good one today. josh haddix outta NC. much love bro travel safe we gonna miss you.
man i'm starting to think that giant airline conglomerate hasn't implemented any of the suggestions in the 183 email surveys i filled out?
ah marin. i just saw guy in a jag hit a dumpster.
@staticfreenoise well . ...i think you and me and dave matthews were the only people that heard it so classic may not be the term ha!

we're making more lessons today for my online video banjo lessons at peghead nation. today we work on various choke holds and eye rake.
my backyard is trve kvlt.
@JohnChaos13 ablazing banjo in the northern sky.
lilypond has banjo tab.
thanks for linux help. musescore does notation pretty good. and it plays it back in a midi banjo to check and all that. i'll try tux guitar too. you can set up banjo in that?
@sonicgrass okay i'll try that.
i could shoot a black metal video in my backyard.
musescore does notation for banjo and will play it back.
is there a tab program for linux?
oh man sonic pi runs in ubuntu studio. it comes with pure data already installed.
you can order my comics and shirts and hats here: https://t.co/tmxMe7ouJ0
them corporate rice cakes are perfectly round. weird. and kinda bleached looking.
my irises are coming up.
@captinmorgan54 tracktion 7 runs in all three OS's and it's free.
i suspect these "pace of play" rule changes will have the result of there being less people watching rather than more.
@captinmorgan54 tracktion 7 running in ubuntu studio.
so for roughly a couple hundred dollars you can have a very nice recording set up. or free if you find someones old computer they don't want. the install wipes it.
a good linux set up for audio is tracktion 7 which is free running inside ubuntu studio. linux runs on older slower computers pretty good.
@shure that mic is killer!
hey pdx i'm playing a show at artichoke music at 730. celloist gideon freudmann joins me.
tim kerr made it cool to be an old punk rock guy sitting and playing a banjo into a mic.
shure ribbon on banjo this week. https://t.co/3SWymJdjMj
been in a session all week not one pair of headphones worn. pretty great.
good to see pinkus killing it in the melvins. love seeing old friends get good jobs playing.

if you like recording i would start thinking about linux.
hmmmm. https://t.co/FkDqyv73Qa
i'm glad this one of two obvious OS's has a nice update. it's starting to look like my linux distro two years ago
also i have you know my trucker hats are actually soaked in real racing fuel.
if you want to take a gander at how to read music on a five string banjo i made this little comic book: https://t.co/tmxMe7ouJ0
i agree with doyle wolfgang von frankenstein. vegan cheese is awesome.
the refused shape of punk to come. great record. i read when they toured the us on that very few people bothered to come. that record is STILL great.

world's shortest music lesson. fall in love with music more. {every master i've studied with loved music even more than i, and i devoted my life to it for 47 years}. i keep finding new things to love via research.
happy new year hippy!
@Unrealbluegrass yeah no one wants to talk to the crew.
when i get asked in airport if im a musician i like to say "no i run monitors for acrimonious defecation. sometimes i get to do front of house."
the viral load/putrid pile split is calling my name.
if you have a cool name like axis of despair you win and you don't even have to make any records.

i found a buncha great videos of early texas punk rock. i'm proud to have grown up going to see that stuff.
i like that band warthog. brooklyn HC.
man i love those old grover non-geared fifth string pegs. forsooth!
them boys wood and wire got a grammy nomination and they got a killer banjist my friend trevor.
i love the video of pete seeger listening to roscoe holcomb. he never checks his phone and pays really close attention
roscoe holcomb reminds me of my uncle murray.
i buy records tapes and books. i can't expect others to buy my work if i don't. but mainly because i like art. septic death is a cool band.
the first person grisman saw play a mandolin was ralph rinzler, who came to demo folk music to his high school class. it was an F2.
@mattsircely i gotta dig that.
is there a standard notation book of the most obvious melodies written clearly like red river valley etc?
grisman did three movies for roger corman.  i saw two of them at the temple texas drive in. early 70's.

@darkmonohue that set up is really good.
apex of western civilization was pete seeger standing up to the HUAC.
if you want to support music go buy stuff on bandcamp. very good deal for artists and end user can pick file size. app is great. lots of the punk rock noise avant music. and banjo.
ahh material world records in brooklyn specializing in fringe counter culture avant garde and DIY.
the band camp track of day is killer: https://t.co/J96zfWy1R1
love when you find a killer punk rock 7 " and they have no social media page or "site".
it's fun to watch the what's in my bag videos and look up the records you don't know. interesting how extreme metal artists tend to have great musical taste.
@ClemTrout oui!
so the hero went back to them peaceful pines with them rocks and a few of them rills. and ya expresser stands and whatnot.
a good thimg to address in one's banjo playing is which is ornamentation and what is that which is being . ....ornamented. is that a word?
records = cave paintings.
man you made my day.  RT @javalinarecords: Between the @Wildknees lessons and that comic how to read music on a banjo, I am actually... reading music on a banjo.   That's a big deal for me.

i have zero interest what's on someone else's computer. more of an aversion. so the idea of having a password for everything is weird.
@paulglasse @DaddarioandCo i could just eat that.
@paulglasse @DaddarioandCo paul that's killer diller!
happy birthday to the beloved meher baba!
musically, within reason, if you study a master from the 40's or whatever, you have access to the sub masters off their tree that came later. insight.
it's funny to be in a fancy hotel but have a bunch of raw vegetarian food ratholed in your room.
a really good project if you wanted to learn how to pick, get the del and dawg record learn every song and learn where they came from.
so glad to be able to hear two sets of del and dawg!
i wasn't trying to choke him i was rolfing his neck!

david is a true master of music. https://t.co/dsu8hbkABR
rehearsed with maestro today. had the very rare experience of being in a band where everyone effortlessly hits at same time.
always try to be the worst guy in band. which is what i am here: https://t.co/GevNGg8njJ
one of my great joys is hearing a true master of music play a simple melody.
gertrude stein. rapper.
what's a hep poetry zine?
do they make flight cases for an L7? 17" bout.
if in general folks paid for music via bandcamp, there wouldn't have to be them fund me deals. and no more endless articles about an impossible equation. my guess is it would fix music biz.
man soundcloud is kind of a wooly scene you can find an assortment of strange things.
it's a double problem if you make a note to yourself you later can't decipher. you had an idea then obfuscated it.
even when san antonio is getting beat you get to see tony parker with the badass layup.
man so many true masters giving away free music lessons on yt. every musician's technique should be highly developed. transcriptions, everything. our collective concept of music should be very high.
@MoonPieCurtis thanks man.
talked to pete rowan yesterday, he's doing better.
talked to the maestro today. he's still learning.

most every master i‚Äôve had the great fortune of studying with, proved to have musical listening skills that exceeded their playing skill. my take away is if you want to play, learn how to really listen.
another method of studying mastership. get an instrument that far exceeds your ability as a player and pay really close attention to what it tells you. a great instrument will speak to you and teach you.
guy next to me on long flight kept falling asleep and catching himself. his head would drop, he eventually did two 360 spinners. linda blair in the exorcist. haw!
man them farmer‚Äôs fridge vending machines are great. they spit out a great salad.
it would be cool if you could access the entire history of written music as easily as you can recorded music. method books, scores, transcriptions. i‚Äôd happily pony up.
@Pea_Pock imma look!

tracktion's daw essentials is a great bundle of plugins that solves the "no good linux plugin" issue pretty handily they are really nice.
waveform is a particularly nice version of tracktion. there is a free version as well. runs great on all three OS's.

yes they wore hats, yes they played fast sometimes. but the real information is in the mechanics. how melodies were developed etc. poetics.
copying their tie or something isn't going to cut it if that's as far as you go.
they played fast. get in there inside the music itself and sort that. i'd find a master and learn how to "think" like them as best you can.
if a person gets interested in an older form of music like bluegrass or something,don't only copy the easy to copy bits. they wore hats.
