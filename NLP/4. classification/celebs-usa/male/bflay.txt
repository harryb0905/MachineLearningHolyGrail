Plan your meal shopping BEFORE you go to the store #FAGEfruyo is always on my list. It's my go-to snack.
My sous chef in the #FAGEfruyo commercial had it right..cut out the work and grab a #FAGEfruyo
Mornings for me can be hectic,getting things organized. It's easy for me to grab a #FAGEfruyo. I know it's going to be delish.
