I do believe if every non-racist individual took to the streets that guy would be out of office within a week. The power is in the people.
Life's too short for a racist in office and the backward momentum of our country has been a scary thing to witness. It's truly time to stop.
I'm not a political activist but I do believe now is not the time to be silent.
I don't care what your political position is as long as we agree that a racist cannot hold the position of leader of the free world in 2017.

The Royals aftershow is only on Facebook. I'll be the guy in half a suit, half a cast/crew Royals sweatshirt -free swag! #TheRoyals
Update on #GoldenGlobes uber driver: Hogging the spinach dip. Leaving his pizza crust in the box. Dick move. #TheRoyals
Tune in to The Royals on E! Currently airing on east coast. I'll be joining Mark Schwahn and @lonewolflindsay for the aftershow. #TheRoyals
So here I am at Mark Schwahn's house (shorter time between drinks) watching our boy @ThisIsLafferty direct the hell out of a great episode.
My #GoldenGlobes uber found out I knew the creator of @TheRoyalsOnE and locked me inside the car -- forced me to take him to his house.
Tonight's episode directed by @ThisIsLafferty. I ain't gonna miss it, neither should you. Here's a TV tip: record the globes #commercialfree https://t.co/xos4E6lRkD
