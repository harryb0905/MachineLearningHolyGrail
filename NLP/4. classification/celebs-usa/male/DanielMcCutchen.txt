@WilkowMajority There is just too much inside baseball going on in government.
@theFortMcKenry Welcome to the former MLB players side. Congratulations on a great career, you were a great teammate.
@BachCan Seen him pull that move a time or two in the show!
Worst call in NCAA history. #Bedlam
Not many guys can say they threw in 7 ws games. No matter what @2Morrow23  is a freaking stud. #capecodteammate #littleleagueteammate
I think that one would have been gone with a regular baseball. #WorldSeriesGame7 #Game7
Put #charliemorton in!
Best baseball game I have ever watched. Wow!
@poutycowboy Believe it
I wonder if someone should brush a guy off the plate. I could be wrong, but these hitters look pretty comfortable. #WorldSeries
Early prediction of this game going extra innings and a position player pitching and getting the win. #WorldSeries
@TheBigHurt_35 So much action. Here is an early prediction to extra innings and we see the first position player to pitch in a World Series game
@Lindu14 @karstens27 He is saying if the guys behind watson didn't give up any runs Watson could have 3 wins in the 1st 5 games.
@TheRealJGuts Come onnnnn kiiiiid
@karstens27 3-0 out of the pen in the World Series. That would be pretty nice.
@ChrisGimenez5 You were behind the plate. You remember. Lots of reaching back to the umpire for a fresh baseball.
@B_Rowen Come oooonnnn kiiiiiiiiiid
This inning is bringing back memories of my pitching career. #WorldSeries
@PJHughes45 If that's the case I am gonna go play long toss and make a comeback
This game is unbelievable! #WorldSeries
Trump, Curry, and LeBron remind me a lot about a fight I had in 5th grade. #growup
@KingJames @StephenCurry30 Could have picked a better noun BUM vagrant. a lazy or worthless person. synonyms:idler, loafer, slacker, good-for-nothing,loser

Mr. President. You take all the credit but take none of the blame.  In sports we would call you a bad teammate.
@FoxNews @POTUS you had control for 8 years. You take all the credit but take no blame.
Great game winning catch last night @Hunter_Renfroe. I can't believe we played 2 seasons together and u never told me u play football.
@AntlerChaser_CC I saw my Buck 2 days ago. I need him to show up in the next 2 days
@AntlerChaser_CC I have another one I am going to take if he doesn't show Buck up before the end of the season. https://t.co/eIdkLqSrHz

@Decker6 The barefoot guys is a  @BernieSanders supporter for sure. I can make anything about politics.
@Decker6 @jennifersterger it's gone forever. That's what happens on snapchat.
@jennifersterger @Decker6 haha . Yes that guy. I made a funny video for him then he was no where to be found
@SexTaIk @FascinatingVids @MSNBC everyone that said they were moving to Canada pack your bags!
@franky3131 @CBSNews corrupt media. Fire them all
I am going to miss all of the awesome celebrities that are going to move to Canada.  #ElectionNight
@tdhagerty I always knew you were a Trump guy!
@Decker6 I am shocked. Not mad but shocked
@Decker6 Trump for president!
@HustonStreet @cory_spang15 Trump!
@HillaryClinton @POTUS haha, I hope this was a joke.
Tomorrow vote! Let your citizenship count for something. Millions would love to have the freedoms and opportunities of Americans. #vote
@toriihunter48 what is going on? That isn't the only questionable move made tonight.
Wow.......
@gehrig38 of Chapman gets 6 outside and the Cubs win Chapman gets the MVP
@Orioles @zbritton @MLB from here on out it should be called the Zach Britton award.
I just got in trouble for starting a @realDonaldTrump chant while waiting to vote early. #NoHillary #draintheswamp
@AntlerChaser_CC I went out yesterday for the first time. Saw a couple bucks but not the big boy. Headed out again tomorrow.

@AntlerChaser_CC nothing like those cows that you hunt.
@AntlerChaser_CC nothing too exciting.  Have a few ranches that I go to here in Texas and have a pretty nice Buck I am after on my place.
@JonesVelwil9 I didn't know that so news to me.
@Decker6 we have never agreed on anything political but agree on about everything else.
@Decker6 @realDonaldTrump 1. his 1st debate =brutal.  He won the next 2 debates=not brutal. Not brutal&gt;brutal=improvement. Hilary=brutal
If @realDonaldTrump doesn't win the election he will leave a much better debater. The improvement from 1st to 3rd Debate was remarkable
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton can we hold you too it or is this another lie?
@astros @Jasonlane16 I know that guy.
@HillaryClinton You Are A Liar
@KevinLehman13th when you have given up as many homers as I have given up you just need a break from seeing homers hit.
Large tax cuts?? Sounds good to me #businessowner
@jakejarmel3 that was the argument if you are watching the debate. Nothing to lol about. Get a real twitter handle troll
@jakejarmel3 aborting a baby 8 months into pregnancy isn't knowing your body, it is murder.
@HillaryClinton thanks for releasing that information.  Seems a little too important to be tweeting about
@realDonaldTrump she is an evil woman
@HillaryClinton let's just deport 1 person...... YOU
@glennbeck at least he was on the right side on the issue. Better then him agreeing it is right
The Main loophole we need to close is the one that that let's @HillaryClinton still run for president #debatenight
@jennifersterger @Decker6 haha, more like 89.
@jennifersterger @HuffingtonPost @Decker6 has both if my locker room memory serves me right. #yesIamgoingtoretiresoIcansayanything
@mlbtraderumors........ uncle.
@Deitel10 @rhitsports shooooooooooooooooooot! Now what stories are you gonna tell in the bullpen?
@RedSoxNationMT hey troll get a life. Glad u know my stats cause I haven't looked them up. My master bathroom is bigger than your trailer.
@57K_Strong BTW the statement was for the commentator saying that talk doesn't go on in the locker room. I am anti Hilary
@jparencibia9 can't believe u watched the game over the debate. I hope you recorded it.
@mike_pence @realDonaldTrump He was on top of his game tonight!
@Nkid91 that's what I am saying. If you don't like the laws change them don't blame people for taking advantage of them.
All these guys that have never played a sport above 8th grade basketball talking about what goes on in the locker room. Smh
@HillaryClinton because it's cheaper. Don't blame him for being good at business
@2Morrow23 very entertaining though.
@2Morrow23 haha so true.
@mcuban neither
Blame it on Abraham Lincoln. Haha my favorite line so far. #PresidentialElection2016
Answer the question @HillaryClinton
Please don't try and make the ACA look like a good deal @HillaryClinton it is Brutal
@EWErickson finally something I agree with
@mcuban the cyber thing is a pretty big thing
So far this debate is very entertaining
@TheRealJGuts the first hitter I faced was @drewstubbs13. He hit a Homer off me on pitch #2.
These two kids sure do love theirs @Popsicle https://t.co/YVm8uRokYJ
@karenhunter........... crickets......
@karenhunter if u give me a name similar to "orange cheeto" that some1 could call press Obama w/o being labeled a racist u win the debate.
@karenhunter "or lack of policies". I'm not defending Trump,  I'm defending defining  some1 b/c of their appearance when u preach against it
@karenhunter I like talk radio, I like educating myself form different view points. I want to be informed. I want solutions.
@karenhunter where you could argue non stop about his policies or lack of policies you choose to call him the orange cheeto.
@karenhunter good attitude.  Your show is based on discrimination b/c of someone's skin color yet your knock on trump is his appearance
@karenhunter  I'll listen to you today. Prove me wrong. I usually find myself agreeing with about 50% of what you say.
@karenhunter @WilkowMajority I listen to your show a lot. I know you better than you think.
@WilkowMajority @karenhunter just a response based on emotion. One of you argues with facts the other with emotion
@HillaryClinton @BrettLoGiurato please don't talk about lying, you are the Queen of lies.
I think I am going to draft #Kaepernic today just so I can release him.
@YaBoy77 @IHOP sound like someone who has never made it out of A ball. #rook
@TheRealJGuts welcome to the club.
@HillaryClinton longest handshake ever.
@SenSanders what about @HillaryClinton ?
@FoxNews  @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz You lost. Get over it and stop trying to hand the democtats the next 4 years.

@TheCUTCH22 @The_Cutch somewhere down the line we are definitely related. You got more baseball skills and I got the better dance skills.
@CammyMoskos @DanielMoskos nice to see Ya throwing cheese again.
@HillaryClinton watch out what you wish for.
@jngold215 @FoxNews they would commit more crimes if the department was weaker. Just my opinion.
@FoxNews @SenSanders disarm law abiding citizens and the police department?  Do the criminals promise to turn their guns in?
@USATOpinion @USATODAY those dang people committing suicide
You drive your electric car, I'll keep my diesel.
@FoxNews unless you are talking about her taxes. She will just give her money to the Clinton foundation. #notaxesforHillary
Gonna try and watch the democratic debate. Can't promise I will make it through it.
@EWErickson @resurgent stealing my tweet as a headline? https://t.co/VLrcSx85Im
Its always talk about eliminating loop holes in the tax system for large corporations. This is a plan works  https://t.co/7kztUdnDWZ
@JebBush more money isn't what you need
@TomiLahren Cruze, Rubio, Trump, everyone else can go ahead and drop out.
@TomiLahren I like Cruze and his tax plan better. Simplify!  Sick of the accountant fees on top of the 39% the government gets.
Abolish the IRS and simplify the tax plan. Best thing I have heard all night. @tedcruz
@charliehildbold debatable
@ksmahieu I like Rubio, I think a few others would have a chance at her. I am sure Kasich is a good guy he is just so boring. To many chops.
Kasich goes over the buzzer every freaking time. How is he on the stage? Who likes him?
@jortle until my 3 year old grabs my phone and votes for @HillaryClinton.
@jparencibia9 I agree.
Not sure what he is talking about when he is saying how hard it is to vote. Does he want an app so you can do it from home??
Term limits. No more life long politicians
Why is the camera man on Kim Davis?? Who cares
@jparencibia9 don't hate because you are only gonna get 1/501 of the winnings now.
I am so confident in my lottery numbers that I bought 500 of the same numbers to up my portion if there is another winner. #sorryboutit

@AdamRussell36 Agree.   the last episode was really boring. #txlandowner
@eatSleepsleep I like him but then again I am also a little crazy.

@AdamRussell36 wish there were more land owners here so I would have something to talk about @AndyLoomis
@ChrisRossetti75 yes they should, but slap the kid om the wrist and make him give the $7500 to charity.
@TheRealJoshSuff very stupid. A suspension over $7500 would cost them millions. Slap him on the wrist and go back to counting your profits!
@AdamRussell36 believe thay kiiiid. #sharkafterdark is a disaster!
ESPN leave Johnny Football alone! The NCAA is making millions off of guys like Manziel they are the one's that need to be disciplined!
@JeffLarish I got some land that needs some ceders cut and burned. Interested?
Shark week cool, #sharkafterdark the stupidest talk show I have ever wasted my time with.

If a wise man has an argument with a foolish man, the fool only rages or laughs, and there is no rest. - Proverbs 29:9
Dang! That ball is way back

Quote of the night ""Mr. President. You are entitled to your own airplane and your own house, but not your own facts." #PRUEDOMINATION
@DeShieldsKD believe it or not there are a few athletes out there with a clue when it comes to politics
I glad we  "the republicans" got a much better candidate this time around.
@MittRomney the debate just ended. How are you already tweeting??
Jim Lehrer need a couple of body 350lb body guards standing by him so he can gain a little controll of this debate.

@Tony26Montana He has great ideas too. ROMNEY FOR PRESIDENT
@Tony26Montana ya i want that pool table. How much??
@ColinCurtis425 haha glad your boys pulled it off
ok, the rule says that you cant block an extra point and run it back but tonight I think they could have gotten away with it
@JMurray_4 @boltey tonight anything goes
@dinomascio Tonight you can do anything
@IAmMapes If i was a replacement ref I would allow it just this once
Wish they would have blocked the extra point and ran it back.
@M_2012H prob be a movie star or maybe a rapper, then again I could always give politics a shot.
@Tony26Montana IF you played football you would be tweeting about these refs for sure.  That is unbelievable.
ahhahahaha what is going on in this game??  These guys don't have a clue
Man, I wish you could pick up penalties off of the wavier wire, they are the picking up a lot of yards tonight.
@Tony26Montana @bradyb_23 you got got.
@Tony26Montana haha believe that.  Next thing is gonna say I got no fastballl. Come on kid
@rickmastfan bahahahha that's also a good idea. Doesn't have to be clean just cleaner than when u got it.
If someone lets you borrow their car return it cleaner than you got it and with more gas than it had in it. That's just what ya do!
@Tony26Montana haha glad to know I am not the only one he talks mad trash on.

@DatNickaNick I still haven't bought myself a new car yet.  Got to save that cheeze
@tsheltwho Wasn't sure hoe long it lasted here.  We go till Jan in Texas
@Wrigley_Mike Piratefest and caravan.
In Pittsburgh all day with nothing to do. Any suggestions? And yes I will go hunting with someone if I got a chance for a big buck.
@NoStressNewsCom sure, what do u need me to do?
@wxstr1964 Haha, glad that little bird found his way out of the stadium.
@mhall00 awesome. Look forward to seeing Yall.
In my opinion the word " Epic" has recently been way overused. Every time I turn on the tv a new commercial has "epic" as their punch line.
@HovmastaM we need to race at a mini camp and see if I can't get lucky.
@MLBFollower1 sorry I am going to try and do better.
Hello everyone. Getting excited about catching up with everyone at caravan and piratefest. Time is flying by.
@JoshuaCossey when I was in Italy the only thing in English was mtv and all they played was britney. It's a bad one...sometimes I run,hide.
Not only am I not seeing any deer this morning but I also have a britney spears song stuck in my head. Ahhhhhhh!
Wow, what a game last night. I will gladly sacrifice a few hrs of sleep staying up watching that.
I got a feeling I am going to see a big buck this morning.
@Broncosman2010 I have seen some decent deer bit haven't taken a shot. I have a few big boys on camera I am waiting on. What about you?
@jhess83 that looks like a good time to me.
@Kridder0912 I hunt in Texas on private land. Have a few different places to go.100 grain.
@Kridder0912 I have used both but and going with mechanical tomorrow.
@jhess83 good luck, I am going to try and hunt a day in pa when I come for caravan and pirates fest.
@bluetubalouba sometimes less is more.  I think I will do some hunting and work on that shoulder strength pulling back 70lbs
@Kridder0912 29in 70 lbs.
I meant which bow.. and yes the middle one is pink.... that's my wives bow. All Matthews z7, z7 tactical, and the passion.
Thanks for being great fans this season. We will see ya next season. Stay tuned for some hunting updates.
That line-out with bases juiced was a pretty good b day present. Thanks @chasethese
@DemitriusThorn just mixing it up a little bit.
@mhall00 we have to give our jerseys back to the club. I think the team store can make one in his size.
@seelye24 ya, that's where I got that bow set up, good people there.
@seelye24 i shoot Matthews bows. I have the z7 and the z7 tactical. http://t.co/O4ryPa4F
@Snowballz_412 it wasn't fake I just shave twice a day.
Follow my good buddy Chris leroux @leroukie63 . He is kind of like me just better looking.
@ColinCurtis425 still gave me 30+ points in fantasy so its a good day in my book.
I really want to go hunting one morning in Milwaukee. Big league stories traded for that big buck. I left my bow in pitt I am a 29 in draw.
@Jack_Carrico ok buddy whatever u say. hope someone gives u a big hug and a pat on the back and makes u feel better.
@jhess83 my place is in Texas, I have some other spots in ok that i am hunting with my dad.
@Maholm28 just got to believe that's the first step, I got a lot of time in the tree stand to think about roster moves.
@Maholm28 I am the best in the league,just happen to be tied for first because u can't get any better than 2-0 at this point in the season.
@NuttingHostage so I should take all of my money out of the stock market and bury my 401k????
@Broncosman2010 I got the fever.... buck fever.
@Maholm28 tied for first is first place
I have scored the fewest points in the pirates ff league, but sitting in first place at 2-0.  Sometimes its better to be lucky than good
@danjm29 your mama needs to wash your mouth out with soap little boy. Go do some pushups or something, make better use of your time.
@danjm29 good luck in life little boy you have a lot to learn.
@rickmastfan I have a few sweet moves that I bust out quite often.
@marvelousmarv51 shoot, sounds good but I am flying out on the 29th. I will be in a stand in Texas on the 2nd.
@rickmastfan yes we did, my computer wouldn't open the draft so I had to do auto draft. Looks like I will be leading the waiver wire pickups
@JoshuaCossey I don't believe u ran a red light. You are such a cautious driver.
@sbruno3   .5 point per reception, we are delayed now til we get a 12th team.
Big fantasy football draft tonight, I have the 5th pick. Any suggestions?
@sjohnsonmsn I always like making the kids happy. I remember how special it was for me as a kid.
@the1and2onlyJG yes I do, I have a bad case of buck fever.
@lolab10 in between Austin and san Antonio
@GOTSVT I heard that last night.
@MattitudeMD she is a DDS
Whitesnake was sweet @drcutch got a shoutout. Best $40 I have spent in sometime.
@LaconicMedia you are so cool talking trash through Twitter.
@beachboyJC Well that proves that he will go yard twice in his first game with the bucs
@jrodisjust2cool  ya I am terrible in that game, maybe they will make me nasty next year.
The first two pitches I ever threw D Lee left the yard so I like the pick up. He is a big bad man.
@mhall00 there is a real good chance a show up to one of them, might put the pads on and run some routes.
Thanks for all the positive support we will be ready to battle again tomorrow.
@SmoothAsButter he is much smoother than I am.
@rickmastfan yes, we are third cousins
@laclips what should they call me? DANIMAL?
Hello Pittsburgh
@Chandler5525 throw lots of strikes.
RT @MountainMan2014 @DanielMcCutchen Can I get a RT for my friends project @TeamBogo workin to fund research in Diabetes.  God Bless
@BMcSorely not an odd question at all. And yes I am.
@DrewSinger10 I might have to take u up on that.
Happy 4th of July everyone. God Bless America.
I was wondering why @hanrahan4457 hadn't thrown the sliders yet. Now I understand. #k-dog
@Bobby_Bucketz we got that w that's all I care about. My boy @danielmoskos picked me up.
http://twitgoo.com/2d6vd0 here ya go.
Catching lots of fish at seven springs with j mac. Good way to spend the off day.
@JoshuaCossey I thought that was pretty funny.
RT @alltimewin @DanielMcCutchen wins 5th career game against the Diamondbacks to move into a 207 way tie for 3,827th MLB All Time Wins
@alltimewins Haha moving my way up.
@hanrahan4457 those are way to sweet for the game.
Hey my wife @drcutch needs some followers, she will prob tweet more than me.
@drcutch wish you were here to sweet thing
@baseballfan1425 I haven't picked a song yet. They usually just have a song when u bat unless your the closer.
http://twitgoo.com/28t5yt I want one of these. Great time with the Navy Seals today.
I also get to hang with some of the Navy Seals tomorrow, I am sure they are going to be pumped and prob get some inside info.
Couldn't have gotten better news when the plane landed in San Diego. Bin Laden is dead, great day for the troops and all of the USA.
@JamesMcDonald53 your a fake. I am with j mac right now.
@ColinCurtis425 basketball game, got it...
@ColinCurtis425 so your tweeting from the dugout or what?
@GabeJohnson10 watch out bradenton.
@markrdamico that's what I was thinking.
@zach_duke she does not like it.
@zach_duke shoot just trying something new.
http://twitgoo.com/202jpu the glasses don't look good but nice little bass.
@Maholm28 you might be 12 under but how many fish have u caught?
http://twitgoo.com/1zud5v j mac isn't Golfing but he is ripping lips. If this was the bass masters he would be in the lead.
Big golf tourney I hope I am the worst player on my team and we will have a chance.
Good to back at it, day one is in the books.
@Madamerosalie Rooting for the Steelers.
@hanrahan4457 what a great weekend, hunting monster bucks  taking 20 bucks from @hanrahan4457 and watching my sooners win a big one.
Boomer Sooner
http://twitgoo.com/mja5f I upgraded from the beetle. Dotel wanted to sport it for the day.
http://twitgoo.com/m62cl Truck is getting some work done and this is the rental. Gonna get worn out tomorrow .
Baylor needs to pull this one out.
The pirates brackets look pretty bad. Maholm was the leader this morning. Not too sure who is leading now.
I spoke to soon.
What seed a team received had had no bearing on the games thus far. Butler pulling off another upset.
@MarkG31 Kansas. Not a good call
I am keeping score on the bb brackets for the pirates and they all look really bad. top bracket is from Burres who flipped a coin each pick
@ShaneAkin going good. Florida is nice.
We move from Pirate City to Mckechine in the morning.  My guess is 10 people forget and show up at the wrong place, well 11 if you count me.
@socctm3 very nice.  That guy looks a lot like me.  Nice pic.  See ya in Pitt.
@idolcarrie75728 I would have to say Charlie Morton has me on singing, I am still not scared to belt out a tune every now and then
Wow just checked this out after a day or so and was pumped to see I almost have 1,000 followers. I better make this more interesting.
@Maholm28 dang you are almost at 1,000 strong.  I am way behind.  I will get some pointers tomorrow.  Can't wait to lead stretch again
Well my team finished 2nd to last but I chipped one in for birdie and Chipped another in from 30 yards for eagle so good day for me.
I have been pretty disappointed with the AI performances tonight.
I think I am going to switch to the cheaper golf balls all of this Florida water is costing me some money.  Maybe range ball floaters..
@GarfooseFan58 nope, what's that?
USA Curling is #1.  Lets go USA clap! clap! clap! clap! clap!
It all starts tomorrow at 8:00am.
Let's go USA clap clap clap clap clap
long drive to Florida rain most of the way. Last year I decided to stop and take a little nap...9 hrs later I woke up. This time hotel..
Just threw a pen with ohlendorf now going to check out his longhorn ranch.
Note to self.. don't  ever go to the grocery store again on super bowl Sunday.
I played a season and a half in Indy so I have to be a colts fan.  You have to love Peyton Manning and Dallas Clark.
34-24 colts
Do you ever eat at the all you can eat places and leave telling yourself you will never go back to one of those places again? Just happened.
Throwing a bullpen in the rain.
@ColinCurtis425 Learned my meat head ways from some of the best.  A little combination of Curtis, Wordy and ..... a bit of Kontos. hooohooo
Going to Texas Roadhouse to get a little protein in me then going to the gym.  It has been raining all day.  I am ready for Florida weather.
@shamtown The Market the way it is there are some great deals out there if you are looking to buy.
found a house and made and offer... I low balled them so prob not going to get it but got the first offer out of the way.
DRVed the Episode of Lost that refreshes you...Didn't DVR the premier... oh well guess I will watch it online.
@ColinCurtis425 I will help you out Colin I have been doing it for about 24hrs so I am a pro now.
@JacobDarrah  In college it was my curveball but now I would have to say my changeup. Fastball command is what sets both of those pitches up
@isaacfromCT Had a great time with the Yanks but also am loving it in PItt.  Maybe in not too many more years I will get to face them in oct
Lost and American Idol on tonight my two Favorite shows.  Thank you to whoever invented the DVR.
Leaving for ST in less than 2 weeks and trying to find and put a contract on a house before then.  Is that Possible?
Well thanks everyone for following. This can get pretty crazy. I will try to make it interesting.

I said I would never do this but I am here now.  I have no followers so I need to do some recruiting.
