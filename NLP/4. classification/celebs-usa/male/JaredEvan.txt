@ohnonobody You will always have a special place in mine!
@KapnKeller_29 Thank you for being patient. It will end up being worth it 🙏🏻
Proud of @illmindPRODUCER for winning his first Grammy last night. It is inspiring. I remember when we made Charlie Brown in my mom’s basement, we just wanted to make music that we loved. It’s the love for what you do that leads to such heights.
@VanessaBorusse @HoodieAllen Hahah no just a coincidence!
@xSensa Hopefully! 💛

@iBluestone @Sethrogen Tis not bluestone 😂
Usually at this time every year I reflect on the year I just had. But this time around I’m gonna say what a decade it’s been. 2009 till now has been such a journey to say the least.   2019 everything comes full circle. Love y’all. And Merry Xmas.

Find a team who let's you go and create while they do the things that you can't, nor want to take care of.
@Jazz7thMan It might be that one or One Good Thing
Sometimes I go down the rabbit hole of listening to all my early shit. When I do, I come to the conclusion that Never Graduated is probably my favorite from that time.
Here's a playlist of all the songs I've released this past year. I figured you guys could vibe to these while I finish my album 🙏🏻❤️  https://t.co/xlieo5toQC
Creativity beats any budget
FIRE! https://t.co/1IwN18uHVv
Being a nice person has so much impact on one's success. It will get you so far in life. It's easy too.
Take 24 hours before acting on emotion. If you still feel the same after 24 hours, act on it.
A Day In The Life. While My Guitar Gently Weeps. And the whole second half of Abbey Road, It’s basically one song. https://t.co/XZ7xKKJKM6
Can’t wait to drop my album when it’s all ready. Remember this tweet for when it eventually drops.

Been excited recently as I’m gearing up for a special release this coming Friday. I was thrown off yesterday and now it’s hard to have the same excitement. Just wanted to remind y’all how grateful I am for you and that I don’t take it for granted. I took a few notes From Mac.
@MindOfHooch Very
Life is fragile
I can't believe I'm typing this but rest Mac. One of the best people I've met in this industry. Such a great kid. I had the privilege of doing a song with him and it's a milestone I will  cherish for the rest of my life. Unreal.
Too young
Unfathomable
Next Friday shall be quite epic. Stay put 🙏🏻
I’m just lucky I get to wake up and make music and have people listen to it

I rap battle myself in it. I talk trash about me. https://t.co/rXJuLQhtO5
I held onto this next record I'll be releasing for a year. It was originally for my album at the time, but the album got crazier. Can't wait for y'all to hear this.
Making songs is an addiction
Thank YOU. And more tunes on the horizon 👊🏻 https://t.co/SHfc10G2GK
You're getting this next Friday https://t.co/I7IlPTgCj7
Another song coming for you next week. Another @illFactor classic to look forward to 🙏🏻
I love releasing art
I find in this day and age that the song is given more attention than the album. So with that being said, you guys will continue to get individual records until it's the perfect time to drop the MASTERPIECE.
If my girl lived on any floor other than the 9th, the song wouldn't sound as good lol. The word "9th" just sings really well.
Would you guys like yet another song soon? Please leave a reply to this tweet with your thoughts and feedback
I love you guys
Never make music for other people. Make music that you personally want to listen to. Be a fan of yourself.
RT this so your followers know that a banger dropped https://t.co/9PJnJpJFuF

Surround yourself with people who do things that you can’t

@SpenceSK803 Appreciate that man!
Hourglass (Acoustic)   https://t.co/SJrpBVPoGV

@Alexander_Kap_ @marizagr Happy bday!
@jellyjade18 Hahah not for a while, that was when I was 16 😂
When I was 14 - 18 my rapper name was Freelance 😂. All of that stuff was pretty much me just trying to sound like Mobb Deep/Wu Tang.

Please go listen to some Mobb Deep today.

@jellyjade18 This is so dope Jade!
I just saw @MikeyFresh1 in a samsung commercial and it's a wonderful thing
@natebrony85 Yeah that's not me that's a brand. Sub Conscious is a song I lent for their mixtape.
@natebrony85 I'm very confused by what you're referring to. All of my songs in the universe say Jared Evan in front of them lol.
@natebrony85 Nope that's not an artist, it's a mixtape that I put one unreleased free song on. No One Else is on an album called boom bap &amp; blues 2
@natebrony85 2014 👊🏻
@HoodieAllen Plainview son
This week 5 years ago I was getting ready to release my first project ever. It was such a unique feeling. June is always nostalgic for me.
@ShannonMatth3ws very true, that is actually odder
New Twitter layout I'm sure I'll get used to you, but right now you're coming off rather odd.
Something special for you next Friday 🤗

@PaisleyRose4 Yep 🙌🏻 @illmindPRODUCER
Would you be interested in acoustic versions of some songs?

@DadecountyRadio Indeed!
@hoodie_evan Thanks man, sure what's up
Thanks to all of you for being the fuel to my creativity, I'm always thinking of you when I create.

Just being yourself gets you very far in life.
@MelissakDK Good Melissa how was yours 👋🏻
Appreciate you Harry https://t.co/TTbCDw6hYJ
tried to reach nirvana but my sound garden grew....
I thought Soundgarden was Led Zeppelin when I was little, I got the two confused. Chris sounded so much like Robert to me. He was bar none.
Dude Chris Cornell is one of the reasons I started attempting to sing. He taught me so much through his music/voice. Huge part of my life.
@jellyjade18 Happy bday !
CHRIS CORNELL NO
@franzi181 😂 more just swaggerful movements than actual dancing
Getting hurt is good because it gives you a higher tolerance for pain.
The #ReviveMe video is actually the first visual I wrote, produced, edited, colored and directed myself. Amped for you guys to see this one.
Good question https://t.co/XAVL8oVoyz
So y'all want this "Revive Me" video?
@ItsVegaTimeee I would never
@snipsi93 That's ok! I'm sure there are others for you to love
Love your mother, you only get 1.
Approaching 5 years https://t.co/LMvtURT1hs
A smash radio record is and would be awesome no doubt. But if you don't have the army first, it almost doesn't matter.
I guess you guys liked that song preview I posted yesterday huh
This message will self destruct shortly https://t.co/U5GEN3kdwh

@michel_use Thank you for listening
Which brings me to my next point, "Kids Forever" is about to hit 500k on @Spotify without any kind of playlisting https://t.co/JSk2w2h3Y3
I'd rather have half a million organic streams without any playlist or force-fed looks, than millions of promoted streams.
Why I do it https://t.co/yS78AEl298
Nope 😉 I made it in 2014 and it is so groundbreakingly special that I've held onto it. Going on the full length album that's underway. https://t.co/EF2OJ7rTzV
I created this song a long time ago btw. It's going on my next album. For those of you who were wondering about this. https://t.co/zqWPBsdhL2

Bradley Nowell is why I started singing. Go look up that name.

@Mishaal_Jamil I appreciate that, and you
Any "beat" is dope if the right song is written to it.
@cathalyse Hahah I should have wrote in parenthesis (for this particular tweet) 😂
The next one is the one I've waited to release my whole life.   Ok tease over.
It's about to be 6 months since #TheBlanketTruth dropped, &amp; there is still so much underway.   PS I've already started working on next album https://t.co/KvDW5J6Sl9
Vision is important, but execution is more important.
@HoodieAllen Do this all the time
Just know I have been super busy working on, and tackling several different things. Can't wait to just show you as oppose to hype it 🙏🏻
Haha yes, and it's an everlasting event until it comes out 😉 https://t.co/fxfLDgM7zN
#ReviveMe is coming don't you worry 😉
@snipsi93 As soon as it's time 😉
By @franzi181 https://t.co/V4BJdd6UZx
Compete with no one but yourself.
@jellyjade18 that's a particular influence that I will NEVER cut off
@jellyjade18 hahah nahh if anything most of my influence comes from tour and everyone in the audience 😇
Just because someone else's art is "popping" doesn't mean the same art will for you. Remember that.
Influence is good, but sometimes it's important to shut it all off so that it doesn't change the natural habitat of your art.
Don't talk about it just do it
@kkohles Thank you Krystal 😇🙏🏻 Yes I agree. Soon!
that verse on heart 2 heart i think is my favorite i've ever written, top 5.
fuck the accolades and everybody's ego

@PaisleyRose4 Idk I feel like grow and change are two different things
Evolution to one's art is important. Although change to one's art may not be. Don't change what made people love you to begin with. Ever.

Might just throw a new record out into the universe this week. U down?
How do you prefer to listen to music?
