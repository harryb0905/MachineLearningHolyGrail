@mitchellichtman For me, the bottom line isn't about what's "right" (your word, not mine), but whether players should be paid well below minimum wage, as many of them are. And whether it's smart for players to be so poor they can't afford the healthiest food, best off-season training.

Hey, isn't this guy supposed to be a part of the Liberal Media? https://t.co/RpO4pZjoQz
He obviously has to resign, and will. But - and I hope this is obvious to anyone who follows me - Virginia GOP saying this is the rankest of hypocrisy. No shame. Zero. https://t.co/FW2KrJZpCC

@JD_Meadows Yes. Very soon. I'll be surprised if not this weekend.

@bruvark @Topps Well, there are actually TONS of action shots. But they tend to be the same action shots. Pitchers, for instance, nearly always mid-delivery. Which is fine. Just not all the time.
Picked up a few dozen new @Topps baseball. The design is refreshing; photos on par with recent sets. Maybe next year, MORE spectacular images like these two? https://t.co/YU9k7yiBet

Hey there, Portlanders! Looking for something to do this afternoon? Visit bucolic St. Johns, and check out our new full-service bookstore: Two Rivers, right behind 2 Stroke Coffee on Lombard. Only place in town for signed copies of CASEY Award-winning POWER BALL (by me, natch).
Fair point? Is it “mature” to routinely provide a high-profile platform for white nationalists and hate-mongers? I tend to think not, but I do have an open mind. https://t.co/1cnC8k9cel

@Raezerblade Same. I wouldn't recommend either of those to a friend.
@TMO_NYC You might be right. There were a few things in Rogue One that I actively disliked, but there were a lot of things I did like.
@_jschreiber I enjoyed that one, too. But I found the CGI versions of Star Wars characters a little creepy.
@ComicCavePDX Don’t apologize! Just check back!
@ChrisJulienCPA Neither do I.
Just pound-for-pound, leaving aside nostalgia, I would say SOLO is the best of the recent Star Wars movies. Call me crazy if you want, but let's check back in five or ten years.
@patrickdavitt That's not bad, actually. So yes, I did exaggerate. There are occasionally, very occasionally, times when it actually makes sense. Thanks.

@ChrisJulienCPA @molly_knight Thanks. I appreciate the kind words, and am thrilled that you enjoyed the book.
@ChrisJulienCPA @molly_knight Chris this is nonsensical. Was U.S. not “democratic” in 1960s? Do you know that “socialism” isn’t communism, and that wealth distribution and democracy have coexisted in many thriving nations for many decades?

@Pfeiffer86 @MarkArmour04 @joe_sheehan We can speak theoretically all night long about planned obsolescence, but in the real world teams lose games because they keep playing high-salary guys who shouldn’t be playing.  Granted, that practice seems to be fading...
@MarkArmour04 @joe_sheehan Mark, this would assume that 26-year-old players with the security of a 10-year contract will progress same as those without. Are we all confident that that's true? Or rather, at what is our confidence percentage? I actually have no sort of feel for the answer.
This is a fun sports story, in which NHL comes off as pretty despicable. I have precisely zero idea what makes this a @Radiolab story, though. https://t.co/3Wz0vvCZCU

@Silver_Stats @billjamesonline Actually, I would guess biggest reason for closeness was Texas missing zero free throws, and KU missing 11. But it was just an odd game, stats-wise. Only 10 turnovers, total?
@billjamesonline 13 for 33 (so, okay)
@billjamesonline I dunno. Watched the game, studying box score. Considering KU shot quite well w/only 4 turnovers, hard to figure how Texas was outstanding. Also hard to figure how it's a 2-point game. Even with 11-22 free throws for 'hawks.

One reader/reviewer accused me of “environmentalism” merely for mentioning the inevitability of things like this. It’s a cult. https://t.co/ty3PioJbQV
There is seemingly no end to the willful, designed cruelty... https://t.co/zmDAg8hfyD
One more like this, and next visit you’re automatically upgraded from couch to hideaway sofa. https://t.co/cgtX2whscF
I knew I would love these guys talking even before my name came up. Why can't all baseball analysis be like this? https://t.co/mGR1SD1xwx
Now do Colon and Baines. https://t.co/NaylQfiWzf
Wait, is this an episode of This Week in Infrastructure Week? https://t.co/lJ3LMkFg23
Great movie. Literally wasn't until the next day when I thought, "Wait, why in hell didn't Weaver just pull over and run into the woods?" https://t.co/yAewPwDFWa
I like 6 hours in the middle of July, too. https://t.co/iYbSFEyfa0
hey i know that guy https://t.co/BDc3sJmAWq
Correct. If it's newsworthy, do a story about it. https://t.co/3aaZ0cY2NS
Just when you're about to lose faith in humanity... https://t.co/gHWuhIBISy
Right. The equivalency arguments, however implicit, are jarring. https://t.co/K6IQq2yVrN
Only the best people. https://t.co/NDkY2exlK6
Sounds fair. https://t.co/yNQu4v4xFn
Is there any chance that after this year we'll never have to hear from this clown again? https://t.co/bCMefEBu4c
Yes, it's true. If you want to listen to me for almost 10 hours, this is the place. https://t.co/DLaSdxB6JT
Just in case you're still looking for a gift for that certain someone, here's what readers have said about a certain book: https://t.co/bmhN6FYrYS

I sleep diagonally every night too. Fortunately, my bed is set up that way. https://t.co/dvWupRUyd7
@geekpondering @jonallendc I know what she's claiming; the point is that she doesn't even bother coming up with any bullshit math (which does exist, or could if they gave a damn about making real arguments).
"Have you done the math on that?" is a good question.  The answer will always, every single time for the entire four years, be some version of no. https://t.co/raAsZ4QdUb
Fair point! https://t.co/PKlh3GUL7i
This is a good one, you guys... https://t.co/jYm3sX2Zae
Sounds like a fun time. https://t.co/vZN2zW5UtR
@BenMank77 If everyone did, I would. But I don't think it's anything close to everyone.
Shorter: Paul is a delusional cultist. https://t.co/VBjZxmbtM1
This is my back yard. This WH is the worst. I mean, just in case you hadn’t noticed. https://t.co/wctzmqbpdM
@BenMank77 I don’t do it. Because I know how uncomfortable I am when it’s done ahead of me. Golden Rule.
What choice does he have? The truth? https://t.co/8pAC8mRUdJ
I believe it’s the business’s responsibility to discourage or prohibit this naked bullshit. https://t.co/hHhDkDmSQy

Sorry about all the time. Probably should have mentioned that Astro Powerball is coming out next spring, combining the two books in condensed form (37 pages). https://t.co/tstPOaS0uj
Damn. I wish you'd mentioned this five hours ago, when I could have grilled you about it. https://t.co/g6zuDS78vU

Do they know it's Christmas? And that baseball fans love getting books to read during the winter? They should know that! https://t.co/cycrj9tgo9
@ErikLundegaard Definitely one of the best of these!
So, so clear. Always so clear. https://t.co/fFrgxtNCLt
I would buy a huge coffee table book filled with photos of guys in livery that don't seem right. For example, Jim Lonborg, Milwaukee Brewer! https://t.co/Nwll3uJUMW
