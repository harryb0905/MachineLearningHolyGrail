Our baseball family lost one of its more vibrant members today. Kevin Towers, the rare personality who could be both your boss and your friend, you will be missed.
I’ve played with a lot of great teammates but when asked who was most instrumental in teaching me how to be a pro, who best understood his place in the game, and who respected all, I always answer the same way.  Congrats @THoffman51.

Happy #MemorialDay to those who paid the ultimate price to protect our freedom at home and abroad. #USA #BostonStrong 🇺🇸
Great to represent CT and the @RedSox on CT Day at Fenway. Only one CT mascot here today - a @Yale bulldog.

Excited to head to the @RedSox, but first thank you to the @Dbacks fans, my teammates, and coaches who made my stay in #AZ so enjoyable.
If team #USA womens basketball plays #UCONN womens basketball, who wins?  Ditka?
The All-Star break came and went uneventfully. I fell asleep Sunday in #Phoenix and woke up Thursday in #Chicago.
If the Justin Verlader and Kate Upton rumors are true, I hope they get married and he takes her name.
No player in the last 50 years has hit for the cycle twice in the same month and not made the #AllStar team. Vote #AaronHill #Dbacks #MLB
Who's on first, Hill's on second. Cast your vote for the 2012 #AllStar game if you want to see a tri-cycle. #AaronHill #Dbacks
Happy 4th of July. The perfect day to consider all those who have sacrificed for our freedom.

@yankeenthusaist I try my best to keep #Passover, but at times it becomes difficult given the food selection in the clubhouse.

@yankeenthusaist Max, while I would never abandon my religious beliefs, when I take the field, I represent the #OaklandAs
...and he just crashed it

The key to #Thanksgiving is eating at 1pm, dessert at 4pm, & then doing it all over again at 6pm!
@hsiaochienshyu We held 3 events on west coast in '10. We will host more in '11. Visit our website for more info www.strike3foundation.org

@Madamerosalie Happy Thanksgiving, Rosalie.
@schittone37 Thanks Matt
@DelPrado @abolishcancer I'm a Twitter novice.  Can you email some more details on how it would work? Thank you.
@Kyle_Phillippi Happy to help out. Shoot me some questions via email at CBreslow@Strike3Foundation.org & I'll answer them as best I can.
@Mrbrewersfan1 No. Not sure how betting regulations fall into the realm of fantasy baseball. No time/interest & figure best to steer clear.
Congratulations to #AndrewBailey & his wife Amanda on their wedding this weekend! Such a beautiful couple.  #OaklandAs #mlb #Athletics

@LindaMags Thank you Linda.  What happens when pitchers and catchers report?  #OaklandAs #Strike3foundation
@GlennGiangrande Seriously?  I was hoping for "try to throw it toward the pins"
@jamesvenes I snuck over to the kids' lanes.  much better. #strike3foundation
@DETigersGirl I can roll 14 lbs.  The issue is where it ends up!  I would hate to be in the lane adjacent to mine. #strike3foundation
@DelPrado What did u have in mind? Always eager to listen to those who want to help.  Especially if there is a way for me to help u as well.
On my way to the #JorgePosada Foundation #Basebowl. Haven't been #bowling in 12yrs. Do they make 5oz. balls? #Yankees #mlb #Craniosynostosis

@Lifebegan3_25 It will be! Have you purchased your ticket?
Congratulations to #EricChavez on an incredible career with the #OaklandAs!   #MLB #Athletics
@BridgettHaney Yes it means we still have them, and not exercising the option grants the player free agency.
Congrats to Ellis & Crisp for having their options picked up. I'm thankful to have u guys playing defense when I'm pitching. #OaklandAs #MLB
@myidink One day the kids will understand!  How are you guys doing? Say Hello!
@myidink I'm great. Thank u for your donation. Substituting a donation to Strike 3 instead of goody bags is such a meaningful sacrifice.
@PlayBall5150 Thank you. I wish your nephew good health. Hopefully 1 day we can eradicate this awful disease. #beatcancer #Strike3
@bigmike0424 I have a few...#HulkHogan, #TheRock, & #TripleH. I guess that shows my age. #WWE

@SI_JonHeyman Jon- Any insight into who will be filling the managerial and pitching coach vacancies? #mlb #OaklandAs

Thank u all for your kind words re: #espn segment on the Strike 3 Foundation. I think the piece did a nice job portraying our mission #MLB
@oakfaninva Thank you
Thank u @WWEUniverse for your support. Having #SgtSlaughter as a guest of my Gala on 11/13 @ the #Stamford Hilton will be a blast! #wwe #mlb
@ElliNSweeneyD All good guesses, definitely relevant & talented, but not correct :)
I owe a lot of my success in #Oakland to Curt Young & I wish him the best. He will be missed. #mlb #Athletics
Lots of ways! Auction donations, attending events, etc. Email at CBreslow@Strike3Foundation.org RT @AMANATHWAL Would love to get involved...

@DHCHICA4EVA That's a lot of reasons to root for the #Rangers. still mulling over it....
@DanielBenLevi Transfer. JK! U will be evaluated relative to big league players. If u r talented u will stand out regardless of where u play
@bonfield Just saw your #facebook post about the Gala.  Looking forward to seeing you in #Stamford on the 13th.
@DHCHICA4EVA I'm still deciding....
@BridgettHaney It's a tough one!
@stivender03 That's understandable.
@killermahonez Thanks Jon!  U should come to the Strike 3 Gala on 11/13 in #Stamford.  #BobbyValentine is the emcee this year!
hmm looks like a bay area vs. #alwest #worldseries...to root for the rivals or the neighbor...
@SI_JonHeyman @biondino I don't know Jeff Francis well, but I hope he wouldn't be offended if I took #Ohlendorf. #Pirates #mlb #oakland
@eraquest I figured it would be...have fun and stay out of trouble guys.
@splashinpumpkin I think It behooves me to root for a bay area team and a division rival. #sfgiants #mlb #oaklandathletics
It would be an honor to read. Send to Strike 3 Foundation PO Box 191 Monroe, CT 06468 RT @LynnBelkin it would be an honor to share my book
#Andrus is having a heck of a series, but I'm still glad #Bailey was the R.O.Y. last year, since #Texas will have this year's.

The perfect end to a #postseason game...a pie from #Lombardis, America's First Pizzeria in #nyc
@MichelleyM of course not. Keep it in the #ALWest & on the west coast...a little nepotism. Root for the #oaklandathletics in 2011!
