It's good to be home At this point it appears no specific plan for a missile launch-The people of South Korea showed warm hospitality
Hard to be hearing and seeing the details of Boston from so far away-proud of my @ABCWorldNews colleagues reporting @ABC
Sec of State @JohnKerry says he will talk to #NorthKorea leader if he slows down his nuke program-He's not telling him to eliminate it @GMA
#NorthKorea did not launch the missile today.. another delay &amp; we have no idea what Kim Jong Un's intent is.  @GMA
Kim Jung Un needs 2 launch the missile sometime just 2 prove he's tough-but it could be delayed because of some negotiation @ABCWorldNews
#NorthKorea rejected an offer from President Park Geun-hye to talk They called that offer a "cunning ploy" I think this is rhetoric again
We r still waiting-No evidence that the missiles r being prepared 4 today  But #NorthKorea can set them up fast. We will see @ABCWorldNews

On @ABCWorldNews We've known for years #NorthKorea has nuclear weapons &amp; powerful missiles, but they never could b attached-They will soon
.@ABCWorldNews Tonight  you should see the new radar the US is bringing into the area from Hawaii.  They can track the launch in the sky.
On @ABCWorldNews Tonight In #NorthKorea there is a mid-range missile ready to launch But now they are driving in short-range ones also

Is North Korea planning a possible nuclear test in addition to the possible missile launch?  We really have no idea. @GMA
The top generals based here in Seoul both SK &amp; US, had planned meetings in DC but today cancelled them-Too dangerous to leave @ABCWorldNews
Kim Jong Un is demanding that Obama needs to call him by phone.  Same message he gave Dennis Rodman. Interesting  @ABCWorldNews

US Embassy told American citizens they are safe in South Korea but the focus tonight is on #NorthKorea &amp; what it will do next @ABCWorldNews
What if #NorthKorea were to launch another missile? If South Korea responds with force it too could set off a bigger conflict @ABCWorldNews
The prospect of the North firing a missile puts the US in a tricky place-forced to make a decision @ABCWorldNews

I am wondering if the North Korean military &amp; Kim Jong Un is just pretending they r ready to fight an act or real fear?  @ABCWorldNews
Some think the maps behind the leader &amp; generals r "digitally altered" http://t.co/Gqmzx2TWLy  @ABCWorldNews Tonight
At this time it is unclear if North Korea is getting more dangerous or just stepping up their propaganda  @ABCWorldNews Tonight
I have been to North Korea 4 times It does seem more dangerous than ever w/ improved nuke bombs &amp; more powerful missiles @ABCWorldNews
The cost of the Iraq War is estimated well into the trillions.   Part of that is the long-term health care costs @ABCWorldNews

#NorthKorea's a safe country unless u break a law W/ that 1 could b in prison 4 life But there r no insurgents like in warzones @wecollie
It was clear they wanted 2 divert us away from launch disaster At event  was Kim Jong Un, the new supreme leader He must be depressed.
They put us in busses for hours-no bathrooms & we had 2 walk for miles  2 watch event celebrating 100th birthday- Kim Il Song @ABCWorldNews
#NorthKorea update- no phones/emails 4 last 6 hours-just returned from propaganda event-most hellish we've been to in years @ABCWorldNews
The government of #NorthKorea . finally admitted that the missile failed to orbit.
1 NK rep said this failure was practice & followed by 2nd rocket that went up perfectly. THAT is a false story A dream that didn’t happen.
We do know that at launch site approx 150 miles nw of here they videotaped it North Korean official told us we'll see video but unsure when
Failure would b huge embarrassment 2 their new leader Kim Jong Un North Korean officials have not answered our questions yet - will shortly
We were expecting 2 see some live coverage of launch shown here on screen- didn't happen Perhaps 4 the very reason this would fail.
Tonight updating from Pyongyang #NorthKorea for @ABCWorldNews all latest on rocket launch
Press room scattered down hallways when word came from US that #NorthKorea had launched the Unha-3.  N. Korean rocket launch FAILS
#NorthKorea said the rocket would be launched sometime between the 12th to the 16th @ABCWorldNews
Nations in the zone of travel of the rocket  say they are ready to shoot it down if it strays over land. #NorthKorea @ABCWorldNews
U.S w/ countries incl South Korea & Japan will track This flight if successful is expected 2 head south over Philippines-landing in the sea
A cover for ballistic missile test which uses similar technology & experts fear if weaponized could reach as far as HAWAII OR ALASKA #NKorea
#NorthKorea is going to launch 90 ton rocket-they say it's simply 2 send a weather satellite into orbit-US Officials believe otherwise.
