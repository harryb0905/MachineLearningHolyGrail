@AlexiLalas hopefully you are in la. we can play a ratt song!
i got the idea for a “song wheel” tour from elvis costello. i have 10(?) albums worth of songs and, for a bunch of reasons, i play a pretty limited set list most of the time. right here, this is the #wayitusedtobe https://t.co/q9KzVQv54i https://t.co/iZ5Ayeawa4
don’t get me wrong, i totally loved those tours… but i was super cooked on the shuck and jive part of it. i missed playing stripped down, acoustic songs for a room full of people who didn't mind if i went off on a 10 minute, weird-ass tangent about oven mitts and justin bieber.
i'd just put out “show me your fangs.” and spent 4 summers in a row doing outdoor, full band shows (either co-headlining or opening) where a lot of my time on stage was spent playing my better known songs and trying to make an impression on people who maybe didn’t know who i was.
hey beautiful people!   most of the pre-show meet &amp; greet hangs have sold out (TYVM!). but there are a handful of M&amp;G tickets left for a few of the shows. low tix alert stuff. so if you’ve been thinking about attending, hurry &amp; get ‘em: https://t.co/Lfl7mpuvbt  📸 Shawn Robbins https://t.co/xs6MSUI1KY

@the1percentgirl it felt like a car backfired in my bathroom
@amybhutch haha yeah. it was a quick one. and felt like it might be too alarmist of a tweet so i deleted it.
@tannenbaumr so. good.
@richardmarx the bummer is that he does know the difference. he is just a sociopath, shit disturber who makes this kind of asshole statement to get actual science-ignorant people riled up &amp; thinking they have an ally.

@STEVEBROWNROCKS @eddievanhalen 🤯🤯🤯
@richardmarx 😂😂😭😂😂
@richardmarx amen, my friend!
my idea of "justice" and "equality" are not the same as other peoples, obviously. so why do i allow myself to continually be surprised / ruined when i am confronted by that? what a waste of my precious, limited time. i am not other people, and they are not me. period.
and i hate my brain for engaging in all this. HATE IT. 45 years old having my day torpedoed by people i don't know and never will. what an absurd way to spend my time. and i hate myself for hating myself for being vulnerable and telling you all this shit...
and if the president of my country doesn't reflect the values i try very hard to foster in myself... kindness, empathy, love, compassion... i'm not entitled to be frustrated by that?! i'm supposed to keep that to myself cause someone who likes my songs doesn't feel the same way??
"stick to music", "illegals are a problem", "YOU DON'T KNOW GO FUCK YOURSELF"... then people say, "well you shouldn't have posted what you did if you can't take it"... &amp;yeah, they're probably right... but then i am supressing how i feel cause i don't like how shitty people are?
it's hard to live in this world. the AVALANCHE of things that we deal w/that can pull us away from things that actually matter. i read the comments on my facebook page, against my better judgement, &amp; just end up hating people. i literally want to punch my way across the country.
we're all so fucking strapped for self-love that when we get a sliver of power most of us can't NOT misuse it. no sense of moderation. alcohol, sugar, sex, god, guns, technology.... everybody's filling the holes in themselves with too much of the wrong shit. MYSELF INCLUDED.
i wish everyone (myself included) could have ACTUAL self respect. not ego. not bravado. not judgemental vitriol. i wish everyone could feel empowered and worth it, cause if we all ACTUALLY felt that way... we would have so much more bandwidth to be cool to each other.
@IrvingPlaza @bleutopia i love @bleutopia but actually @blusanders is opening this show.
remember that time i wrote that really passionate tweet and posted it everywhere but misspelled “country’s” in it (after having spelled it right 13 words before)?   🤦🏻‍♂️
holding our country’s infastructure hostage to solve the manufactured crisis of non-white people fucking up our countries infastructure is some next level, racist, black mirror shit.   this is gonna be a wild chapter to study in history class in 2045.

we have a special guest #wayitusedtobe story... can you guess who it is? go find out HERE: https://t.co/xpkWemszFw https://t.co/pYwWdlPM1L
we used to stay up all night talking about how amazing she was. they ended up dating, i ended up heartbroken &amp; in the friendzone (we're also still very good friends)… but that's another story for another time...  #wayitusedtobe
we were also in love with the same girl… so that made my whole senior year very “dawson’s creek”...
in true me style, i wrote this one the night before it was due. bennie was (still is) one of my best friends. he &amp; i used to listen to records in our high school dorm room ALL THE TIME... just having our minds blown… lots of u2. lots of REM. lots of the 3rd til tuesday album.
this is my college admissions essay… my second one. i wrote a first one, but it was a bust. i don’t remember what it was about but i remember it was self-consciously trying to be what i thought college admissions people wanted to hear. https://t.co/0oETEejPAr
time to talk about the #wayitusedtobe...

@hexlub 😊😊
i still remember how rad it felt… like i was taking control of my life... heading to california and getting paid to play music…  look out world, here i come!  #wayitusedtobe
this photo is a copy of the check they paid me with - $75 ...which might as well have been $1,000,000 i was so psyched… it was the first real money i’d ever gotten for playing music… before that it had been school talent shows &amp; busking the sidewalks of harvard sq. for change. https://t.co/AAKVd1cABt
i’d spent every summer since i was born one town over, in center tuftonboro, so i had a bunch of friends who came out to cheer me on.
i remember playing R.E.M. songs, indigo girls songs, drivn’ n’ cryin’ songs… as well as a bunch of stuff that ended up on my first album, “please.”
i borrowed an acoustic guitar with a pickup from one of my boarding school teachers (thank you, mr. alton!), borrowed a PA from another teacher (thank you, bill wightman!), and did a two hour set.
the first show i ever got paid to play was @ rumors cafe in wolfboro, NH, in the summer of 1991… about two weeks before my friend jeff (RIP) and i drove across country in his beat up volkswagen jetta to start college.
oh, it's that time again... time to talk about the #wayitusedtobe. sit back, relax &amp; here we go!

@AGreatBigWorld cannot wait to see your faces!!!!!!!!!
@richardmarx i’m here all night... try the veal!
@richardmarx “lucy in the sky with bitcoins”!
@richardmarx “all you need is vape”?
@richardmarx i like to think the grind on their soul is so heavy and shitty that they lead very unhappy lives. even if they dont recognize it.
it is still so absolutely wild to me that we live in a culture that validates and rewards people for being assholes.
it's hard to articulate how validating / inspiring this was to listen to.   to hear my music talked about in the same way i talk about music that i love, to have my albums analyzed like they're a body of work &amp; i'm an evolving artist... this ruled me!   thank u craig &amp; deanna ❤️ https://t.co/UU1w5qdrvE
@saysthefox you flatter me 🙃 thank you for a great hang today!

@danitheduck21 agree to disagree.
@danitheduck21 i mean... i can only tell u my thoughts and my perspective. but compassion &amp; empathy, for me, are the only way forward. thats why, even though it’s EXTREMELY difficult to have in this world these days, i work on trying to have it.
@danitheduck21 i mean, ur statement is actually un true. poor people DID vote for him. and of course racists voted for him. and of course our country is built on racism. neither of these are the point of MY tweets, tho.
and i have to add that our country has done a terrible job advocating for the poor. and has continued to increase the divide between the classes. so i get why some ppl voted for him... but the jig is fucking up with that guy... and he is lowering the bar of humanity on all of us.
our president is trash.   i get that a bunch of u love guns or hate abortions or only think about the “debt” of our country...  but u elected a piece of unempathetic, terrified, sociopathic garbage.. who respects absolutely no one &amp; no thing. w/our country @ the top of that list.
P.S. gonna look through the #wayitusedtobe hashtag now &amp; post some of my favorites to my ig story...
in kindergarten, the teachers asked us to write about our favorite thing in the whole world...   #wayitusedtobe https://t.co/gEq34IFJ5F

@kwdarby @musiccitynotes @mountain_goats everything about this thread is incredible. thank you both! and YES of course i remember our interview, katie 😊
@jaketapper this is a really amazing thing you are doing here.
so cool to be on an @AppleMusic playlist with the great @rhettmiller AND to have him tweet that he considers me a "luminary" !!!! #lovemesomerhettmiller https://t.co/PA5M5LzUbE
and just like that... we're done! 10 songs. whew!  thanks for reading all these..   i think i'm gonna compile them all together &amp; send them out to the mailing list in the next couple weeks.. just so folks have them.   so make sure you're signed up if that is something you dig...
probably 'used to be' or 'mine.'  i never really get tired of them. https://t.co/f2isxIrBBt
&amp; one final note…  if you want to make @StacyGlenJones super happy, let him know you LOVE his guitar part in the choruses of “let you go"... he's super proud of it.  tell him it makes the song. 🥰  check out "let you go" &amp; "sings his sad heart" below  https://t.co/wgNzyplqZS
and that cocteau twins pre-chorus… the ethereal vocals &amp; the pulsing kick… was stacy’s obession for a day. when he finished it, it sounded so good i didn’t even want put the lead vocal on it.
of all the songs  on the album,  this one has my  favorite track.  the way the music  drops out and then  launches you into  the choruses  just SLAYS me…   that was adam and amir.
and p.s.-    i have 1000% lived  the line “the only reason  i still call our friends /  is the chance  one of them will  say your name.”   yikes!
i really loved the idea of  a song sung by someone  who is SO codependent  that they have to ask  the person who dumped them  for advice on how to get  through the break up.
my friend sara told me about  this vacation she took to  bora bora, where she spent  the whole time in a hut  on the beach...  and pretty much didn’t see  another human. bora bora  didn’t fit the melody, so i  moved everything to mexico…  but that’s how we got the first verse.
i wrote most of “let you go”  in san francisco with jeremy.  he was passing through  on his way up north  and i stole him  for a couple of hours...
@simply_madness_ one guy did! haha
@zeroemissean fuck, man... i LOVE my 1950 j45, so i feel you on this.. and am FLATTERED!!
just finished the final song blurb thing for "let you go"...   you all feeling it or do you want me to wait until tomorrow?
@_favaloras ☹️
@TheMinimalists i might be down sooner than that... and yes, of course. im flattered! how often do u record it? i’ll follow. then dm me details pls!
@TheMinimalists @kopthat1 @JFM 🙏🏼 thank u for the smiles over here!!
@DesiJed YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!
word. this makes total sense... will do it from here on out. thanks sadie. https://t.co/EX9Bo5r3WY
noted, for sure. thanks, charity! https://t.co/vo9W6zCyYZ
and just to be clear....   at the time we wrote the song together, teddy had not yet transitioned and was still identifying as a "he", and that is why i wrote it that way. up for debate, i'm sure. but just wanted everyone to know my thinking...
“it’s kinda funny  that we never made out /  it’s kinda funny  how we drove ourselves  crazy”…   man, i love that line!  now i've gotta write  a song to put it in.  click through to check out "back together" &amp; my album "sings his sad heart"  https://t.co/wgNzyplqZS
the only good news about  writing so many sets of lyrics for a song like this is that  you have a lot of good scraps left over to use later...  “back together" takes the  prize, actually, for having  my favorite unused lyric  of the whole album:
stacy &amp; i finished the song  at his place in atwater. he came up with the idea  of singing a counter-melody  in the second verse.  i vamped it, he approved and now it’s my favorite  part of the song.
my manager jonathan convinced me to keep it. it’s a relief when  that happens, actually. when someone u trust  steps in &amp; breaks the over analytical doubt  loop you’re in. without those people,  i’d be rewriting  some of my songs  for the rest of my life.
the lyrics took me FOREVER. i didn’t even want to call the  song “back together.” the title was a place holder and when i went back to it,  it felt trite. i kept trying to find  different/better words to fit...  “alone together,”  “run forever,”  “stand the weather."
our demo version was slow, the chorus had this swagger. just place holder lyrics,  melodies and chords.  once the song got to NYC adam &amp; amir &amp; i sped it up…  and that chorus started  sounding SUPER hooky!
i wrote most of "back together" with teddy geiger in his living room, overlooking a canyon in one of those houses in los angeles that makes you want to move there.
it's looking like "back together" is the winner... fun!!  will post in a minute. ❤️
@PositionMusic @MusicNegrito @BBCLater FUCK YES @MusicNegrito !!!!!!!
@SherylCrow @EmilySaliers A-FUCKING-MEN TO THIS!!!!!!
ok.. if i can get my shit together this afteroon, i'm gonna post another song blurb. we only have two left on the record that i haven't done. choices are:  "back together"  OR  "let you go"  guide me, sweet people. let me know which one you want today...  thanks!!
@TheRealRoccoP whoa!! old school me. yikes. hope your son is digging his job!
and THIS... https://t.co/YDSTNiyoKK
i'm sorry that it took his death for me to discover the greatness of tony hoagland... BUT THESE WORDS!!! https://t.co/Diych6COzW
@milesreggie1 good point. zero.
@StalkingKyle 😭
and “sweet soul music” is my lyrical tip of the hat to an obscure-ish u2 song i love called “hawkmoon 269."  click through to check out "best drugs" &amp; my album "sings his sad heart"   https://t.co/wgNzyplqZS
and finally, two fun music nerd things about the song:  we had been talking about how magical a song  “everyday i write the book” by elvis costello is, so butch put a clavinet-sounding homage to it in  the verses, under the vocal.
i finished the words at home and i was especially proud of the middle 8:   “i can see the beauty in the mess and imperfection / when you’re running through me / i get pulled in all directions / swallowed by the beauty / and lost in inspiration”   look at me being all positive!
we have trouble finding a chorus.  the first time i went in to write with butch,  i pulled the verse and the tag out  and presented it like a problem to solve. he immediately got a hold of it, cracked it open,  and came up with chorus chords and a melody... and a KILLING track!
fast forward 9 years &amp; i’m in a writing session  with my buddy jeremy and i pull out the line (&amp; the guitar riff)… and he doesn’t think it sucks! (AND he knows a thing or two about drugs)  so we end up writing a verse &amp; a tag,  but it’s less of a song, and more of a round…
(and since i'd never actually DONE a drug,  i figured maybe they knew something i didn’t  about how they worked).
i’d been carrying around the line “you come on like the best drugs”  since the “modern love” album. i'd never used it because  somewhere along the way  someone told me it wasn’t very good...
ok.. i think the winner is "best drugs"  but by a VERY small margin...   you all rule. posting now.
which song description blurb thing should i do next...  "back together" or "best drugs"?  help a brother decide.

@hexlub two separate 80's heart album references in one day has to be some sort of twitter record.
alexa ALWAYS has my back! https://t.co/jrH37AR0mt
and i’m learning that that’s really the job… do your best to trust yourself, then trust the song, then get out of the way.  https://t.co/wgNzyplqZS
this is gonna sound super hippy,  but songs tell you what they want to be. you just have to pay attention  and not let your ego lead. and more often than not, your first creative thought is your most clear and potent.
when the song finally made it’s way to stacy,  he came in with fresh ears and we stripped stuff back  even more. hung everything off the riff and the vocal. and kept it small.
adams’ guitar riff saved the song. that descending, motown riff. this song wouldn't have made it without that that was the rudder... then amir sang those amazing background vocals, i tacked on a melody/lyric danny parker  and i wrote as a post chorus… and we were off!
god love amir…  that kid came out to san francisco  and hung in with me @ JJ’s studio for DAYS  while we ate chinese food and  fine tooth combed every word
when we were writing it, the chorus lyric  came out all at once, in one big chunk...  “gimme your love, it used to be mine.”  and i thought… “i’m DEFINITELY gonna change that.” i also rhymed “darkness” with “darkness”  which felt super lazy… was gonna fix that too.
if something comes easily, i doubt it  and pretty much spend the rest of my energy  trying to disprove it… fun stuff! this song pushed all those buttons…
and the lyrics… man, it took  almost a year of tweaking (and avoidance)  to have them end up, pretty much, right back  where they started. i have serious trust issues  when it comes to inspiration.
i almost overthought "gimme your love” out of existence 4 different times while we were making this album.  we did a bossanova version…  a late night, washy keyboard, hipster version. and that adele song “right as rain"... we have a version like that too.
i still have 4 songs left off the album that i haven't written a blurb about...i'm gonna do one now, if that's cool... the completist in me needs satisfying.
@hexlub never!
that is FUCKING DEFINITELY what i mean. 😜 https://t.co/y6tnhpBQHu
also, there is a low ticket warning for a handful of the shows that aren’t yet sold out… so, if you plan on coming, don’t sleep on getting tix. this tour is gonna be SUPER fun (we will be bringing out the song wheel again!). so head on over &amp; get tickets: https://t.co/I8fLQ2ubzM
we moved the ORLANDO SHOW to a larger venue and it is the ONLY FLORIDA SHOW on this whole tour (and it’s a saturday night which is perfect for a lil’ roadtrip… you feelin’ me jacksonville / tampa /miami / etc.) get tix https://t.co/uKgUBnL01C
we added a 2nd show in san francisco. get tix https://t.co/zwLufCyg5k
we added a 2nd show in boston. get tix https://t.co/mbmDEPoqam
so we went back to see what we could do to make more tickets available. we were able to do a couple things...
most of the feb/march acoustic headline tour is sold out (which totally rules, btw!)… i know it was frustrating to a lot of you that some of the shows sold out as fast as they did… truthfully, it took us by surprise...
@emmgryner GODDESS!
B-E-A-UTIFUL PEOPLE!! doing a giveaway with @liveinvineyard (happening nov 2nd-4th) for a pair of tickets, hotel accommodations, airfare for two + more. enter away https://t.co/YYIVX6oePE
HEY FLORIDA... SOME GOOD NEWS COMING VERY SOON FOR PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T GET TICKETS FOR MY ORLANDO SHOW... STAY TUNED!!   (this is so important i used all caps. ya feel me?)
in a time where folks are buying less &amp; less music each year... my new record sold significantly MORE in it's first week than my last one (&amp; my last one was on a traditional label!) ...that is pretty fucking neat! &amp; WAY gratifying.   HUGE THANK YOU to everyone for the support! ❤️
@TheGunzShow it was church!
oh shit, happy birthday “beneath these fireworks”!   i remember buying it the day it came out @ the tower records on broadway in NYC. first time i ever had an album of mine in a store. &amp; it was end capped. i was over the moon!   thanks jocelyn. https://t.co/55bNDkqyKe
@mark_mcgrath you’re a sweet mofo, mcgrath!
but most of all, be kind and empathetic to yourself. we are on a huge learning curve here. and the only way to learn is to make mistakes. and the only way to make mistakes is to forgive yourself. do not give up on yourself. or this life. because it ALWAYS gets better.
life is finite. &amp; it is fucking amazing. be kind to strangers. be empathetic to people you don't understand. as much as you can, let the shit that doesn't matter roll off of you. cultivate THAT skill... the skill of not letting useless, tiny, inconsequential shit weigh u down...
we are SO FUCKING POROUS and we are SO FRAGILE.... but we are also SO FUCKING POWERFUL... and capable of working through anything that is in our way. it just takes time. even when it feels like it is sitting on your chest... you can make it through. you just need time and help...
... and everything can seem super dark and super dire. here is the thing.. WE WILL ALL GET THROUGH THIS. we always resurface. we always find the way through difficulty... PLEASE just wait it out. or find a therapist. or talk to a friend. or go for a run... just HOLD ON....
it's really easy to sink into "we are fucked"&amp;"this is the worst it's ever been"&amp; just the overall energy of dis-ease going on in our country. it's also easy to let the weight of that stuff color everything. add to that the normal lies our brains tell us, &amp; actual hardship...
@scarson45 you are the greatest!!! thank you for the love... hope to see you all soon!

@alexjwhitaker alex, you rule! thank you for the compliments and i will FOR SURE be back to australia sometime in the near-ish future.
and so, ladies and gentleman, without further ado, i present to you my 9th(!!!!) studio album:   "matt nathanson sings his sad heart”  https://t.co/wgNzyplqZS https://t.co/ueX1W2L1zH
"my friend lynn said “your problem is you let other people's music save you, but you don’t let your own music save you.” harsh but true. i’m working on it, though, lynn. and this feels like a good first step."
most of the time, when i listen, i forget it’s me. my inner assassins take a nap and i can just enjoy it. that's probably the highest compliment i can give the album…. i forget i’m involved. ha.
i’m proud of this record. i’m proud of all of them, actually, but this one is the only one i've ever made that i like listening to. so that’s real fun! from the first claps of “mine” to the reverbed out background vocals in “sadness,” i still get swept up in it.
i guess i’ve got some deep seated stuff i still need to work on... or maybe i got it all out with these songs. who knows, we’ll see.
big day.  i called the album “sings his sad heart” because i was trying to be funny about the fact that almost all the songs are about loss. i don’t know why either, because my life is real full of beauty these days. not a lot of loss going on.
@DweezilZappa love this record! i still listen to it on cassette 🙌🏼👴🏻
still one of the coolest parts of making an album... getting the vinyl and seeing what the packaging we designed looks like.   this one is SOOOO KILLING!!! 🔥 https://t.co/GrBcIfZriz

the country i want would investigate this thing until there was no stone left unturned.  at least, because he is going to be a supreme court judge  at most, to show women of this country (&amp; this world) that their voices fucking matter  THAT is the only way to handle this. period.
@ibejackz that is SO DOPE!!! ♥️♥️♥️
“sometimes the things you love / don’t love you back”  brutal stuff.  https://t.co/MkOnkPTtNM
the part of the song  that really lays me out though is the middle 8. when everything drops out and there’s just that rhodes,  and that guitar and my voice. all dry and up front. resigned.
the demo was sparse. but when i got back to butch’s in december, he had taken it all  “avalon”-era roxy music. dreamy and washy and sexy.  way better.
we’ll see the sunrise again... we’ll find happiness again... it’s just not gonna be together.
this song is an exercise in writing about the opposite. about surrender. about coming to terms with the fact that you can only change the “you,” not the “us.” and not being bitter about it. just facing facts.
i live with the delusion  that i can change the outcome of things by just trying harder. it’s a recipe for constant disappointment, for sure. but i still do it.
i had the “different beds” lyric in a poem. i wrote the rest of the words  up in tahoe, during thanksgiving break. i love the words so much. i love the story.
we worked fast, butch is all gut and confidence and inspiration when he makes music. it’s easy to follow him.
.@butchwalker's studio  is on the west side close to the ocean (and a killer comic book shop). the air moves there. it's different than the rest of los angeles. it’s really hard to feel stuck  when you’re surrounded  by that much movement.
by the time i got to butch’s last november, i just remember feeling relief. after a couple of years of feeling lost, the album was FINALLY in focus. and almost done. and the year was winding down.
@Vanessaaa2 that was a super fun night! :)
tonight feels like a good night to release another new song off my album, right?  “different beds”. 12amEST/9PT.   ❤️ / ❤️

that’s right, my people... @aarontap &amp; i are hitting the road this february / march for an intimate, duo acoustic tour of these beautiful united states (and toronto!).  ticket info is all on my website HERE: https://t.co/G1V0fdYdVH https://t.co/KAsh0sfo8R
with that being said...  I’M GOING ON AN ACOUSTIC HEADLINING TOUR!! I’M GOING ON AN ACOUSTIC HEADLINING TOUR!! I’M GOING ON AN ACOUSTIC HEADLINING TOUR!!
as you know, we're within spitting distance (10/5!) of the release of “sings his sad heart.” this has pretty much been the longest lead up to an album launch in the history of recorded music, so i don’t need to tell you how psyched i am for you all have the whole thing.
💥BIG, FUN-ASS NEWS COMING YOUR WAY, FROM ME, TOMORROW.💥
@MollyQuinn93 brutal.
@richardmarx don't forget the ENTIRE middle 8 of obvious child:  starting w/ "sonny sits by his window &amp; thinks to himself / how it's strange that some rooms are like cages" all the way to "sonny wanders beyond his interior walls / runs his hands through his thinning brown hair"  i am dead.
@richardmarx YES!!!
and the “sail on silver girl” verse in “bridge over troubled water”... FORGET IT!    i cant make it thru that shit without crying. EVER.
so many lyrics on that album raised the bar for everyone. but yeah, that one is strong!   dont even get me started on the “angels in the architecture” line in ‘call me al’. ⚰️ https://t.co/4y0I5OhUL2
and now im listening to “carolina in my mind” and really there are few lines on earth better than:  “ain’t it just like a friend of mine / to hit me from behind”  fuuuuuuuck man.  james taylor!
there is just SO MUCH in that line. crushing. and the way they deliver it. and where it comes in the song. just crushed my whole world. paul simon’s songs are fucking treasures.
that tweet going around a month or so ago asking for the best paul simon lyric. just impossible. he’s too good. but right now, in my garage putting tour gear away... i was completely side-swiped by:  “where have you gone, joe dimaggio / a nation turns its lonely eyes to you.”  🤯
@shervinfoto @SylvanEsso ⚰️ &lt;- me.
it's a great time to learn how to be a good human by just watching (and doing the opposite of) all the people who aren't.
it's a very unique human who can handle power. most just let it erode their moral compass until all they care about it is holding on to / increasing the power they have. running over everyone else in the process.
@4SeasonsComedy @TheRealRoccoP that was a fun one!
@mountain_goats @pitzercollege you are the best, JD. ❤️

also, if you can, miss me with your "my team / your team / shut up and sing / i came here for the songs" bullshit and just hit unfollow.
@steph326 don't change a thing!
i know i'm just a singer, w/ no real idea how politics or humans work (thanks internet!) but i think the only reason he won't win is because people are still motivated more by fear than progress and inclusion... AND people are intimidated by him, because he's smart.
@orlandosgm also, it means people are turned off because he is smart.
@orlandosgm if he doesn't, it's just because fear is still a way stronger motivator for people than inclusion and progress.
beto is really really good.
@paulakelley99 @TheRealRoccoP stop it, you! youre making me all blushy

early show tonight, rhode island!  the new repects @ 6pm we go on @ 6:35pm.  oar @ 8:20.   see you in a few hours!
i think the hardest work we do is  unbraiding ourselves from habits  that don’t work for us anymore and clearing space in our lives to just enjoy the moments we’re in.  very psyched for you to finally hear this song!  https://t.co/2XBb5b8d3R
i’ve spent most of my life with my  past hanging around my neck (kinda like a big, unfun flavor flav  clock.)  less and less as the years go by,  but still…
it was screwdriver work. but I'm  super proud of them:  “grew up believing love was a grudge / and home was a place  where you lived with your guard  up.”  “people keep saying memories  fade / mine are all drunk and they  just keep calling”
stacy’s buddy laid down the rad  “graceland” bass part which tied the whole thing together for me.  made it feel like a living, breathing  organism.   stacy’s tireless like that… always  down for making the song better.  the lyrics took me awhile, as  usual…
it was HILARIOUS!  that happened a lot with this song.  i think it’s cause the kick drum is so ruling… and because amir’s  background vocals make every  song feel like sly &amp; the family  stone.   i went back to los angeles to finish  up the track with stacy &amp; craig…
nolan &amp; i wrote most of “long  distance runner” in los angeles.  the title’s a nod to this sea wolf  song i love.  we tracked most of it @ crush in  NYC.  during recording, whenever things  started to get good, amir &amp; adam  would bust into these crazy ass,  amazing dance moves…
@samanthasevero this kicks total ass... thank you samantha! 😊😊😊

@VadipDundee that always feels too fast to me. but it is real fucking good. i prefer the box set version

oh fuck!....  “misunderstood” -wilco (kicking television version)  “miami” - counting crows (new amsterdam live version)   radiohead doing “fake plastic trees” way back on conan. youtube that fucking mighty-ness.   every song kendrick did in his 2016 grammy performance https://t.co/GnCC4fRI4Q
“night they drove old dixie down” &amp; “the weight”- the band (last waltz version) “no surrender” - springsteen (live 75-85 boxset version) “miami 2017” &amp; “everybody loves you now” - billy joel (songs in the attic version)  i know i am missing crucial ones. grrrr! https://t.co/GnCC4fRI4Q

austin texas NEVER disappoints. what a next level show tonight. thank you, thank you, thanks you... we needed that!
@mountain_goats @eyehatethou marty &amp; jason for the win!!!
i’ve always wanted a song like this. just one big fat pocket... where the chorus never jumps out at you, it just goes around and around.  like a meditative loop. it’s my little nod to prince.  cause he owned this kinda shit. RIP. 💜  https://t.co/QvnkVLjhOS
“Mine” has the weird badge of being the very first song written  for the album and the very last  one finished.
JD said it could use  a post-chorus. at some point along the way we wrote one. my middle timeline  is a little fuzzy. i know butch &amp; i finished it. in december of last year... back out in santa monica.
the first time adam, amir  &amp; i got together in NYC (2 years ago!) we got the bones of it done. the claps. the bells.  the groove. watching pallin work  is one of my favorite things ever. he just keeps picking  up different instruments  and laying down  the dirtiest GROOVE!
i started “Mine” with danny  in this crazy, songwriter  hive house by the beach  in santa monica. we got most of the chords and melodies.  and the hook lyric. i went home and tried to  finish the rest of words…  that took a year. "convoluter, party of one, your table’s ready!"
https://t.co/exbJRLNAOf
i was so moved  that i cried  a couple of times  ...and that's just  not really a move  i EVER do with my own songs. it just hit me super hard.  it still does.  ‘when all your friends  were friends with me”… fuck.
the original demo  was just my voice  &amp; sean’s piano.  after we finished it,  i remember driving  around los angeles  all night  listening to it  on repeat.
i don’t know why i sing  about loss so much,  i have such  an amazing life.  and i feel more dialed  into it every day.  i guess it just takes  a long time to get over  the sad stuff. it’s a deep well.
i finished it with stacy  @ his place in the valley. january in LA is  pretty magical too. then we sent it to  john to mix.  and here we are.
i started recording it in NYC,  last fall, with adam and amir.  the vocoder in the  pre-chrous SLAYS me. i stayed in this rad little apartment  on the upper west side.  by the park. leaves falling  off the trees. sweater weather.  magical stuff.
“used to be” came out fast  just like “way way back” did. sean and i wrote it in an afternoon. in his living room, which has a  crazy view of all of los angeles.
@FurtherFromSky nadine. she is at crush. do you know her?
@MyLifeOnTour hahaha oh shit
I AM SO VERY PSYCHED YOU ALL FINALLY GET TO HEAR THESE SONGS!
“Mine” is the kind of song i have always wanted to write. groove! groove! groove! it’s my nod to prince. check it out! https://t.co/QvnkVLjhOS
“Used To Be” has taken the mantle of “favorite song i have ever written”. i LOVE it. check it out! https://t.co/exbJRLNAOf
i couldn’t decide on the next song i wanted you to hear off of it, so i picked two…   “Used To Be” AND “Mine”!
pre-order it from my webstore RIGHT HERE https://t.co/o6GFLzwL9U RIGHT NOW! we pulled together a bunch of real cool pre-order bundles for it &amp; we’re including a LIMITED EDITION vinyl release of my def leppard EP “Pyromattia” (on WHITE VINYL!!!!) with the 1st 500 bundles ordered!
- i made it with a bunch of friends.  in a bunch of places.  over the last 3 years.  - it’s an album about being the only one left hung up on the past. - i wore a blazer on the cover. - i am super in love with it!  (the album, not the blazer).
SUPER EXCITING NEWS!!! my NEW ALBUM is called:   “Sings His Sad Heart”.  it comes out OCTOBER 5TH!   https://t.co/wgNzyp3Q8k https://t.co/qvdd6Wu9hV

@shervinfoto i cant like this thing enough  yay!!
it is a tough time to be a caring, porous human.
for anyone keeping score out there... "wicked game" by @ChrisIsaak IS THE SAME FUCKING 3 CHORDS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT IS GENIUS AND NEVER GETS BORING. ... ugh, i just can't even with this life. i need a new job.
when your brain, body, circumstances tell u ur trapped and u feel helpless and alone... remember these thai kids &amp; the people helping them get out of this cave. we are so much stronger and more amazing and capable than we let ourselves believe. #ThaiCaveRescue
@emily___pearson oh shit.. i think i had it made right before the modern love record. so 2009. it's a funny guitar, cause no one likes playing it but me. all the guys in my band hate it. it's sort of a beast. haha. but it's MY beast 😍
@Tom_DErrico thanks tom!!

i get a lot of shit from my lady for keeping clothes past their prime (i still wear a couple sweatshirts i got in high school), but this one’s still going strong, don’t you think? https://t.co/NXjzRdlEg4
if i named my new album “punch the president” it would get way more eyes on it than if the songs were good. crazy times.

i met @aarontap in a kitchen @ a restaurant in downtown lexington mass. where we used to make inauthentic italian food and fight over what we listened to on the radio. now, he is one of the most crucial humans in my life &amp; he has an AMAZING new EP out TODAY... CHECK IT PEOPLE!!! https://t.co/rbA2gGC5Ix
im so sorry to hear about richard swift's death. too sudden. too young. sending love to everyone who knew and loved him.
HAPPY FRIDAY, BEAUTIFUL HUMANS!  couldn't be more psyched to finally  have my new song,"way way back",  out in the world!  thank you for the  landslide of good love about it you've been flooring me!!!  and if you haven't heard it yet... go on get it!  https://t.co/TRDsBr0Qeq
@thesulk i can't even be in a car on the cape anymore without wanting to commit a homicide.
@RepairMethod you are the absolute fucking greatest.
it’s magical, my job. collaborating with friends. human collision at its finest. psyched for you to finally hear it. https://t.co/TRDsBqJfmS https://t.co/yZPg86yRKU
i finished it with butch  back out in LA, by the beach, just as the year was ending. john KILLED the mixes and then jade shot the video in three hours  @ a supermarket in the valley.
i recorded the bulk of it with adam &amp; amir  last summer. at a studio in the village, on the top floor of an old building  with a death-trap elevator  and janky air conditioning.
i wrote ‘way way back’ with sean  in a basement in los angeles. i had the first line. he had the hook.  the rest came REAL fast. lyrics too. i've never written a song this good that fast.
@emmgryner @survivorband that was such a rad hang. thanks for making it happen. “i cant hold back” 😍
#soonish is almost #hereish

@richardmarx toilet paper? #lefthandman
i find comfort in the thought that no one is ever  really gone.  we’re the building  blocks of each other.  and the ones we’ve  loved never really disappear  my new song is called “way way back”  it’s coming friday https://t.co/LkeSwQj9ng
i’ve been thinking about change a lot  it’s crazy how people that used to be everything aren’t anymore  being faded out sucks going from the lead to a bit part in a movie you used to direct is an adjustment for even the most  dialed-in person

@Sharkyl real talk: you kinda do. #sharkyisagingbackwards
@ambwatt everything. god that song is perfect
does anybody ever wish they lived in norway and were as good looking as the singer from ah-ha and had written a song as good as “take on me”... or is it just me?
@richardmarx like daisy says “she has been here before”. incredible!

@SayChris3x thanks chris!
anthony bourdain was a special type of human. in a time when ugliness is a major currency, he cracked open beautiful parts of the world for us all to see. very very sad day. sending love to all the people that loved him in real life. RIP sir.

@jasonbieler @DefLeppard @aarontap i would have killed to have seen this tour. and pete! legendary!!! so so so rad!!
@musicsgf that whole record owns me.
@meganchambrs that made me lol and snort.
@PopPopInAttic that's the 'me and my wine' video, right??
@reynoldstop20 oh my god, ME TOO! i loved the whole 'euphoria' record.. so good!
@pmscrub @DefLeppard those were magical shows.. i loved that place!!
and stay tuned for a whole lot more info coming VERY VERY VERY SOONISH about my “you know what” that you have been waiting for since my last “you know what” (for those not good at hints, i’m talking about my new album).
the E.P. is called “Pyromattia” (get it?!) &amp; it is out RIGHT NOW! so take it for a spin. live with it. love it. it’s my crazy-ass metal super nerd fan gift to you. ps- it sounds REALLY great on headphones. (and you’ll feel invincible with them on… ha!) https://t.co/SMnkVcVAZl https://t.co/14ZFwQL3BL
now, i love A LOT of music… but @defleppard is one of the few bands that live in rarified air for me. top tier greatness. so @aarontap (he is a HUGE DL fan too) &amp; i decided that we would… you guessed it: RECORD AN ENTIRE E.P. OF DEF LEPPARD SONGS!! CAN I GET A 'HELLS YES'!!!
if you've been paying attention to my posts this week you’ve probably figured out that i LOVE the band @defleppard. (and i like leg day @ the gym)
@nic_cath oh man. im sorry.
@The_Tyrant we are definitely learning it for the set.. so, maybe!! :)
@jheil FUCK YES x10000000000000!!!!!
VERY EXCITED to share with you the first track off my "Pyromattia" E.P. (out tonight @ midnight et/9pm pt!!) via @billboard...here's "Pour Some Sugar On Me" https://t.co/DYBn3PnurC enjoy!
@siriusxmvolume @Metallica i LOVED that record.

this is a next level amazing photo. https://t.co/2hCBHVXwJa
@dryintherain not paying 4 a meet&amp;greet wouldnt hinder u from meeting me. it would hinder u from not going to the meet&amp;greet. w/out meet&amp;greet u still have the same chance of meeting me as u do w/1, whether or not u attend it. ps- thank u for being so awesome about the preorders. that rules!!
@awphotographs the premium seats/early entry part seems to be the biggest thorn. i am gonna try to figure it out. people who don't want/can't afford the extra $ for the pre-show thing shouldn't be penalized when it comes to seats, for sure. let's see if i can figure it out or not. ha
@melancholyjen this photo rules! memory lane. :)
@VocalLizzy totally get the hurting of the concert budget. i get it.
@Beeeiscute this made me L to the O to the mutherfucking L
@withquietwords @andrewmcmahon that man is the the best! i love all this.
@HeatherDeLuca this feels right on.. totally
@redcoloredstars @ericacharlotte those were VERY fun days. and i totally remember. i don't miss driving my own ass around this country tho...
@ineffablecait @tahoegirl63 you rule. we're doing 70 min. so it's a real set. and OAR rule. it's gonna be a rad night. thanks for coming :)
we need a new president.
@brittlanglois thanks brittany!
@AStokosaPhoto @trainFanForLife i like this idea!
@NattyMat18 for sure the songs.. i love the idea of a hang. songs/food/talking. just general hang. that is an extra thing for people who want it.
@WoahItsChelseaa @_terifisher this is the best thread i have ever been included in.
@kyletelliott @suzyqtwou hero!!
@jlfazio620 love this picture!
@StlCrdsfn11 understood... thanks :)
@gmand oh shit... i remember that show AND that photo.. hope you are great, greg!
@StlCrdsfn11 that's sounds amazing, how much did he charge?
@Samantha_1713 yeah. i get that. the price thing is really tough. im trying to find a balance where i you are not paying an arm and a leg, but you get an experience that is worth whatever money you are paying.
@americanslang21 didn't think about the work day piece. thank you for that!! (and your kind words)
@jutmenezes oh, just you wait justin!
@jenniffurr ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@tahoegirl63 bing. go. 🧐😀
@annettesan thank you annette!!
@tahoegirl63 @trainFanForLife im not gonna do it on the oar tour.
@suzyqtwou i LOVE doing it, but it is kinda exhausting from a post-show perspective. and venues hate it. and people hate it if they have to split to get up early the next day.
this is rad. i'm getting a lot of great info. thanks to everyone for responding. the tshirt/meet me post-show thing i've been doing doesn't work on a bunch of levels, so im trying to find a way to have it be more organized&amp;more of an experience for folks &amp; for manageable $$.
@IsraelsonLarry @zacbrownband @100 oh yeah.... his meet &amp; greets are the gold standard, for sure!
@_andrea_s_ i get that. im trying to figure out a way where the price is reasonable and the experience is rad and connected. but i hear you on all this.
@JimmyHumps i used to do those for reps back in the day. they were super fun. as a perk for pimping me. i like stephen's thing for sure. i think we both stole it from guster. ha
@trainFanForLife this seems to be one of the biggest bummers about the pre-show meet and greet and folks who want the front. will try to figure that out
@JennyRay28 those were super fun and you RULE for all these photos!! but yeah the old way doesn't work anymore on a bunch of levels and im trying to figure out a new way. thanks for your kind words :)
@Bigouette_Jp this is the best response yet.
@forthereading yeah i hear u. its why i havent done real m&amp;g before. that said i wanna try to make it work cause the buy a shirt/meet and greet takes way too long and has way too many hoops to jump thru
@ZoeGroffMUA thanks. it was a nightmare logistically, unfortunately. post show. venues want to go home. ppl want to go home. so im trying to figure out a way to do it before
@ParrotUmbrella this is kind of a neat angle, the cause thing.  i understand why they feel exclusive. that is the part that is unavoidably sucky about them.
@tweerdt word. that blows. very not me.
@Hey_Quackidee this is one of my main concerns. how do we make it work and worth it. cause tickets arent cheap either
@ChristiaP7 this is great to know. i would give way more too if we expanded it. would try and make it special and a good hang.
@KelseyFarrow got it. i think im gonna try to change it up a bit in the future cause those things end up being kind of post-show mess for the venue &amp; some ppl have to get home and cant stay. etc
@noralitz me. too.
@astintaylor that place is my hell
ok, serious question: what do u all love / hate about meet &amp; greet add ons for artists @ their shows? in need of a change in that dept &amp; wanted to poll the group.
@Stephen_Kellogg the guitar solo in that song gives me life. #vito
@Stephen_Kellogg oh god... not so secret. 🙌 #littlefighter #lightsandthunder #lovedontcomeeasy #dontgiveup
@ScottiHill i feel enriched. 🙌
@peter2hess i KNEW you would feel that way :)
@judyrn0604 im sorry for your loss. that has to be incredibly hard. this picture rules. thanks for sharing it.
best one of these yet. thank u @FATJEW https://t.co/frJIL92LEu
@LizAnnSonders thanks, sweet human. hope you are great!
also, apologies in advance for any overly emotional tweets i might send in the next week +.... i'm weaning myself off of 14 weeks of some gnarly shingles pain medication.
i added a bunch of rad songs to my "i like music more than i like people" playlist.  it's pretty much the best playlist on @spotify, if i do say myself. come check it out and find your new favorite song!   https://t.co/xgjPFBhwQ8 #NowPlaying
i grew up having no self esteem &amp; trying to be accepted by everyone. then i worked as hard as i could to get a job where i take intimate parts of myself &amp; put them out into the world where, on some level, i hope they will be accepted by everyone. that's hilarious.
@Rockerazzi @ProFlowers @FedEx ugh.
@AlexSkolnick i love this so much!
yes. yes. yes. #mellencamp https://t.co/SUUr7Ymdu5
@Sharkyl it always felt forced and created.
@Sharkyl FUCK YES SHARKY I AGREE 20000000%. as much as i love springsteen, his position "of the people" never really felt like a great fit to me.
@PicNic120 just listening thru records.. and being leveled.
@otistux1 that is a particularly great lyric for a pop song. that whole thing. high, HIGH bar.
and don't even get me started on the second verse of "scarecrow".... next. level.
"well there's a black man / with black cat / living in a black neighborhood / he's got an interstate running through his front yard / you know he thinks he's got it so good... oh but ain't that america" is the FIRST FUCKING VERSE OF PINK HOUSES! come on!
"sleepin' with your back to your loved one / this is all that we've learned about happiness" #mellencampisTOOgood
i mean... the chorus lyric of his biggest hit is "oh yeah, life goes on / long after the thrill of living is gone"... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THAT GENIUS!
john mellencamp is EVERY BIT as good as bruce springsteen. and history should remember him as such.
@ScottiHill "a bull with allergies" = your autobiography title or your first solo album.
i'm glad we get to live in a world with @JasonIsbell's songs in it.

VERY psyched to be joining my good friend, and neighbor, @michaelfranti at his “do it for the love” benefit concert may 24th @ the archer hotel in napa, ca.  limited tickets on sale now!! https://t.co/oLLK2av7MC https://t.co/Wiicj8pzdc
the sad fact is most humans are just not capable of handling power. ESPECIALLY when fear trumps rational thought. we have proven this again &amp; again. guns ARE power. &amp; fear, these days, drives almost EVERYTHING we see/hear. this video is infuriating &amp; heartbreaking. https://t.co/AydE9y6qyY
it's real hard to care about making videos for your songs when someone like childish gambino drops something as next level as "this is america". everything else just feels like trite, bad self promotion.
figured out the album cover yesterday. it is so fucking strong. @shervinfoto is a monster. I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU ALL TO SEE/HEAR THIS NEW ALBUM... AHHHHH!!! #REALsoonish
@KellyGinn22 i just might not be all that good at stealing.. haha
@pzizzo @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico this i very much need to hear. we might need a summit.
@pzizzo @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico i was doing a gig with lukather once and asked him about it. he just said everyone was friends and everyone ripped everyone else off. inspiration city.
@Wildaboutmusic @springsteen c'mon... it's 1000% the ACOUSTIC version of 'no surrender' from the live boxset. wait, does that count?
@pzizzo @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico ps- i am doing this on my phone, and apparently i am 200 years old cause i keep deleting shit.
full disclosure, you guys... i'm not friends with drake anymore either.
@mikeerrico jeff watson. soo good!
@pzizzo @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico so this started as a metal thread. but a good transition to this: EVH ripped off talk to ya later by the tubes (written by lukather) for little guitars.
@pzizzo @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico you are blowing my mind.
@kerryrawe @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico jake e lee was the underrated MVP of the 80s for me.
@mikeerrico they all played kramers and jacksons. 😂
@pzizzo @Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico i thought rick played the solo on “love somebody” himself... you have just destroyed one of my fundamental beliefs.
@thescreendoor all stunning. nuno, vito, vai, jake... oh man so good!
@cheleshine that is my second favorite, FOR SURE. they have similar feels and styles. so good!!
@thescreendoor goddamn, i love me some jake e lee.
@mikeerrico here's the deal... i think that 'stranglehold' is my very favorite first minute of a song ever. and i kinda love the solo in 'high enough'.. how it modulates. but yeah, ted is trash. sadly.
@mikeerrico i kinda think the whole band was... dare i say it... zeppelin level in their unique-ness. those DLR songs really crush my universe. stop judging me..
@LizzyLepp that JUST makes the cut. '81. SO GOOD. i think that was pete willis taking that. steve was mostly rhythm.
@Adrian_Carter84 @mikeerrico i couldn't agree more
@LizzyLepp 100000%. those are all NUTTY solos. also, let's not forget phil's solo in "photograph." man, @ScottiHill is a beast!!
@mikeerrico he was nuts. so graceful. he crushes me. but i just think that mick sweda on that bullet boys song really transcends. ps- i might be the only person on earth who talks like this about 80s metal
@mikeerrico oh man. c'mon... those records are so flawless! beamed in from mars :)
@ANP5150 YES YES YES
@lilredirishgal LOVE that solo. fuuuuuuuuck.
@jmichaelsrocks john sykes. another one of my most favorite players. played a lot like mick sweda, actually. hard to argue with you.
@songprocess i always loved mark kendall's feel! (maiden were untouchable.)
@mikeerrico and how crazy is it that i said what i said and the majority of DLR era-VH record were released in the 80s. ugh. i might need to rethink this.
@mikeerrico what can i tell you... i bob when others weave.
im going on record to say that the guitar solo in "smooth up in ya" by bulletboys is my favorite metal solo of the 80s. #micksweda   discuss...
@JeffLemire @DarkHorseComics @mightyfineline @dean_ormston finally digging into the first book of this, jeff. you are so next level and inspiring... it rules knowing that all the books you create/are involved in are gonna crush. consistent greatness like that is a rarity.
spent last weekend taking care of my 7year old without my wife &amp; i have a new found, crazy ass deep respect for her (obviously) but also for every parent on earth who has to do this job alone. you are all fucking superheroes. truly.

i mean... right now there is no one who people are following more closely than donald trump. and kanye fucking trolled that guy, stole the focus and promoted himself and his new record. love it or hate it, that is some genius-level game playing right there.
he married a kardashian right b4 putting out his last record &amp; i thought, "WOW, that's next level commitment to playing the game of fame. he gets maximum exposure." then i thought, "unfortunately, now that he's done it, he'll never be able to top that for his next record." #Kanye
@silvana62005 i think yes. i'll be joining you soon.

@Sharkyl dental surgery is brutal. sorry to hear that. i'm moving into mid week 2 of shingles. #oldmanoverhere
how is it that january was 170 days long this year, and february's gone in a week?
@ninaereid @bill_foreman and i never said don't take sides. i believe you stand up &amp; fight for the things you believe in. 10000%. i just think there has to be a place you can get to where you fight with everything you have AND feel empathy for the other at the same time.
@ninaereid and i, for sure, set that level of empathy as a goal in my own life.
@ninaereid im not saying that i have the capacity for that kind of empathy. and it doesn't mean the guy condoned the killing of his child. it just means that in order for that guy to be at peace, he needed to do this. that is next level shit.
@ninaereid there was a fascinating article i read once where this man's son had been shot &amp; killed. and every week he went into the jail to visit the kid that killed his son. he did this for years. and he said "there are victims on both sides of a gun"
@Caissie but my question is.. it is one i need to develop. can i have empathy for a person while NOT condoning their behavior and while actively fighting against their behavior? this feels like the challenge.
@Caissie obviously, twitter is a tough forum to really get the nuisances across of this discussion. especially since i agree with you... being empathetic towards someone i view as being cruel/unjust to others is a skill i have yet to develop.
@Caissie the conviction of both sides FEELS real to them. to each of them. cause of what they believe &amp; how they were raised. how do these two people exist on the same planet without hating each other for their beliefs?
@Caissie one person believes they have to fight for the right of an unborn child. one person believes they have to fight for the right of the woman carrying the child. how do those two people coexist when they both sides feel their stance is crucial?
@Caissie whether hate speech deserves a platform or not is a different thing. i am coming more from the angle of how do we coexist in a world where people believe things other people morally oppose? it falls on both sides.
we are never gonna be a country where the individuals are guided by the same moral compass. it's just impossible. so how do we all live together without HATING each other?
this is just gonna be a ping pong match for the rest of our lives if we can't figure out a way to live/coexist with one another and our VERY different opinions on things.
how do i NOT hate donald trump, even though i strongly and morally disagree with so many of the things he has said and done? THIS is the challenge.
how do we de-escalate the vitriol &amp; anger towards individuals while still fighting against the things they believe?
the real question is: how do we have empathy for people who have completely opposing views to our own? how do we fight for what we believe in without vilifying "the other"?

@susanmichellen of course! i think you rule for reaching out and being honest. i would never block anyone... unless they were just raining down unhelpful shit on me that was rubbing me wrong  and, really, that's my problem... not theirs.
@susanmichellen im not gonna hate on you for having your perspective and your opinions. esp cause i kind of agree with you. but the shortcomings of this piece were easier for me overlook, for whatever reason, and i found it moving and i learned from it, so i posted it.
@susanmichellen anyway, long story short.. i just post things that move me. and that i feel are/were important to me. there is about a 1000% chance that others will NOT feel the same. sometimes it works out where they do, sometimes not.
@susanmichellen and i appreciate you reaching out like you did. i think this is huge. twitter is sort of a tough way to communicate, so i hope this is landing as i intend with you...
@susanmichellen so i get where you are coming from. there were some inflammatory things peppered into this, for sure. totally understandable that it pissed you off. and thus (i just used 'thus') effected you differently than it effected me.
@susanmichellen but the fact is, i didn't write it. i couldn't have written it. this is her experience. and with that comes parts that i may not particularly agree with... but the meat of what she is saying, for me, really cracked open my brain. that's why i shared it.
@susanmichellen for me, what was moving about this was the woman's point of view. truthfully, there are parts of it that i felt pulled the focus of what she was talking about. and those parts were mostly her judgements of others. im assuming, the same stuff that turned you off.

as a rock nerd kid in 70's boston, the holy trinity was aerosmith/boston/j.geils. super sad day. #RIPJGEILS https://t.co/ZQRr7YhLlH
i have no equals sign on this. it was just shitty and way unneccesary (i am in fucking TAMPA &amp; got a random ding from TSA pre).
fear is ugly. but thinking you can keep yourself safe by doing shit that is clearly a violation of other people's rights is WAY uglier.
and truth told if the TSA had patted down my kid like that, i'd be in jail right now for sure.
i can't even imagine how violating it feels to have to give up ur password to ur phone to get back into ur own country. (yeah, that happens)
i have no idea why i am venting, cause i fucking hate when people do this. but i just think that it's all sorts of wrong.
and i respect the concept of the TSA... but if i'm feeling violated, i've got think it was pretty fucking violating. truth.
and after i did a search on the internet... it seems he was doing everything within the guidelines of the TSA's new pat down procedure.
i am far from a modest person. like... VERY far. but i just had a pat down by a TSA agent at the tampa airport that was overkill x100000
i'm about to be that guy....
@izlawiz that totally rules!

@THEKID_ this isnt really a unifying sentiment. we gotta dig deeper.
...so all that being said, how do we then unite as a people to a much higher % than we have been/currently are? this is 1 of our challenges.
history also shows that people r only capable of seeing things they have seen &amp; will only care if they see themselves in the cause somehow
history shows us that people telling each other they're idiots for not thinking the same way isnt something we're ever gonna get rid of.

@IncognitoBall those were fun shows! i appreciate that u dig my music. my twitter is a dynamic place. i rarely, if ever speak abt politics
@IncognitoBall where in the tweet u responded to did i ever call you racist?
@ithappens68 u seem real entrenched in taking political sides on this. my post was from the side of humanity. we seem 2b missing each other
@ithappens68 ur trying to one up me on terrible shit children do to each other because of the hate they learn from adults? im confused
@ithappens68 this is not a liberal/conservative thing. neither was my post. if u see eye to eye with me on it, what is the debate?
@ithappens68 why you would give me push back on a tweet i tweeted that is the EXACT SAME THING u are railing against with this video
@ithappens68 @ithappens68 i agree with u. 1000%.  this is BEYOND heartbreaking. we are speaking about the same thing here. im confused
@ithappens68 @faceless_girl adult choices vs childrens choices. i agree that we need to dial back the hate. 1000%. but come on.
@ithappens68 @faceless_girl these are fucking CHILDREN. in a multicutural learning enviornment. chanting xenophbic shit. that is so beyond
@ithappens68 @faceless_girl dawn. im not condoning violent protests by adults. i never have. but these r two very separate things to me.

@KellyEWRoskam &amp; i dont think we can discount how disenfranchised people feel from their own government. perceived and/or real.
@KellyEWRoskam i agree w/ you completely on this. but a large portion of the country doesnt. thats a place to learn. part of our evolution.
@KellyEWRoskam i think love goes hand in hand with empathy. even for ppl who i dont agree with.
@KellyEWRoskam im speaking about bernie &amp; trump. the fact that there was so much passion 4 both those candidates is telling.

@lunibird1 understood. have read a lot of comments from ppl who feel how u feel. and you voted accordingly.
@kimmaicutler this has been a disappointing morning.
@JohnRileyy my processing time on this might not coincide with others processing time. thats understandable, right?
@setaside2 im not optimistic. just looking at history. and the cycle of real change and evolution.
@setaside2 it takes big threat to fully engage the people who were sleeping. then those ppl join the ppl who r in action &amp; everything moves
@setaside2 balance &amp; evolution. i have faith in balance &amp;evolution. its tilted this way now, cause we're in the swing of evolutionary change
@setaside2 i think, as a country, we have to take responsibility on some level for failing the people who vote against themselves.
@setaside2 we are at our most divided in my lifetime, for sure.
@setaside2 yep thats a huge part of it too. also that people on all sides feel let down by their government. whether its perceived or real.
his platform was pretty much anti- anything that wasnt english speaking, white, straight &amp; male &amp; we voted him in as our leader. mind blown.
2 years of news organizations talking. now they're talking more trying to explain how they were wrong. im tired of people talking.

and i am SO tired of people who try to disprove actual injustice in order to make themselves feel "safer" and "better."
and i have no time for people who see their perceived threat as something more valid than someone else's ACTUAL threat.
i have zero time for people who spend their time &amp; energy trying to explain how someone else's problem isn't actually a problem.

im not saying i wouldnt have been disappointed too. but i think he has the right as an artist, and a human, to express himself.
father john misty obviously felt comfortable enough with the @wxpnfm crowd to express himself like that.  https://t.co/Z5LEJEzgEo
artist's are humans. capable of being emotionally overwhelmed just like everyone else.  https://t.co/LypVUWHBQb
we dont get to choose how people express their dissatisfaction. https://t.co/LypVUWHBQb
it is the audience's job to choose whether or not they want to keep showing up.
third, it is not the artist's job to please the audience. the artist's job is to tell their truth.
FJM's lyrics are, most of the time, pretty nonsensical. its how he chooses to express himself. i happen to dig it https://t.co/KWyl1M4pX9

i wish the (scattered) people who told me to stop expressing myself and "just sing" would say that shit to my face.
everyone's a fucking expert on what's wrong.
its so tiring. when you post something about humanity, people say "stop being political."
it's hard not to want to beat kindness into the hearts of people.
my post about my kid and our countries progress (the same one i posted here) got some AMAZING responses over on facebook.
people's pavlovian response to certain words on social media continue to amaze me.
@nochance2dance i DID see this! and i thought the same thing... so bad ass!

our evolution isnt gonna come from the dark shitty scared parts of ourselves. its gonna come from the light.
its easy to get dark. its easy to jettison hope. pessimism is an easier road. feels familiar. work harder. fucking lean into hope &amp; optimism
fear takes control for a very short time. love is a forever thing. to live in love, u float. fear just grinds u out. https://t.co/aIZGLB4x9B
if you are fighting on the side of things staying the same, you will lose. that is inevitable.
there'll always be people who want things to stay the same. the winners. but change is unstoppable. that is a fact.
in my lifetime, people are more awake and aware than i have ever seen. consequently, the kickback from the other side has become louder.
pessimism is a mechanism we use to "protect" ourselves. it is misguided to think it is "worse than its ever been". have faith in humans.
we arent. look @ history. its a cycle. it always comes back around to justice. then goes into the weeds then back. https://t.co/TBNp8XYQfK
this is a cycle. all of it. the seeds of this particular cycle were sown in the 80s. love always wins. empathy always wins. just takes time
once art starts speaking up, historically that means the evolution is imminent. progress away from fear and towards justice and inclusivity.
on an underground level, it is there. but VERY FEW successful artists are tackling how upside down our society currently is in their songs.
to finally see white artists who have a platform stop the presses, stand up &amp; speak about the craziness&amp; injustice, i fucking WELCOME that.
kendrick, kanye, beyoncé speak the truth LOUDLY in their records. they use their platform &amp; their performances to make REAL statements.
as an artist, what father john misty &amp; third eye blind did at their shows in the last few days is SUPER inspiring.

we are better than this.
cause until it happens to you or someone close to you, its a fucking movie you can feel badly about, but then turn off.
and ranting on social media is so fucking useless. myself included. people are immune to words. and truth. and facts.
the filter thru which some people in this country view facts is so twisted &amp; inhumane.
and the way the police handled that situation was the OPPOSITE of serve &amp; protect.
how anyone can watch this #patrickmumford video &amp; straight faced say we live in a post-racial society is fucking beyond me.
reno ruled it tonight! and PP &amp; i got our peter gabriel on... 'digging in the dirt', baby! (pic by @MyLifeOnTour) https://t.co/eLWxyzKGw3

time it takes 4 swarms of angry "i'm not racist!" racists to show up in my Fbook comments under an article about empathy &amp; equality: 3 days.
what does it say about me that i get super stressed out coloring in these new age coloring books that are supposed to help you de-stress?
we can put people on the moon, we've got self driving cars, but we still can't edit a misspelled tweet.

thanks to @natebutchli for hipping me to that last tweet. i didn't @ him in it in to shield him, in case the twitter hate rains down.
"there is a difference between focus and exclusion".  this is SO articulate &amp; so right on. RE: #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/XrQ7i2aFLT
...and the pissed off dog pile of hate im gonna get for posting that last tweet is never NOT gonna surprise me.
the "all lives matter" response to people saying "black lives matter" is so severely misguided that it is short circuiting my brain.
