we did "We Are the World" in 1985..."A change can only come, when we stand together as one." Our work towards change is far from over.
We have to honestly ask ourselves "are we doing that?" In the midst of such an obvious national divide, I'm reflecting on the very reason..
This isn't a political post; this IS a post on the fact that we have a duty 2 our kids to leave this🌎in a better condition than we found it.
