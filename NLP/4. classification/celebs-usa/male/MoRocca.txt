Thanks for listening to #MOBITUARIES. And thanks to our dazzling team of producers, led this episode by @MegMarcus, whom I’ve always thought of as the Lois Weber of podcasting. https://t.co/hKqa8Le3ij
That’s Lois on the right, starring in the movie she wrote and directed.
Lois Weber was one of the most powerful and innovative filmmakers in Hollywood 100 years ago - and one of the first to use a split-screen, here in the 1913 movie Suspense. Her story in this episode of #MOBITUARIES  https://t.co/mG8r1lz92X https://t.co/maubKpFzc3
“Back in San Antonio, I didn’t know any better. I was just a pretty young thing.”
This press conference is Off The Wall.
You cannot make this up ... unless you are a writer for South Park. Because this would make for a really good episode.
100 years ago one of the highest paid and most important filmmakers was Lois Weber. Lois. Not Louis.  Her story on this episode of #MOBITUARIES.  https://t.co/mG8r1lz92X https://t.co/72dGFDO2go
@fbergin3 Thanks, Frank!
@AmyHillHearth Thanks Amy! You’re great on the episode.

@UnitedWeFanDoc @sepinwall That said, I can’t wait to watch. (In other words, please don’t beat me up, Longmirers!)
@UnitedWeFanDoc @sepinwall Loathe as I am to join this battle but ... I hadn’t heard of Longmire before ALAN brought it up. In fact I thought it sounded like the name of a medieval European conflict, as in ...the Battle of Longmire?

@Steph48Steph @ApplePodcasts Wow. I have heard of many families that put the First Family album away after JFK’s murder, never to play it again.
If you don’t know this album, ask your parents. Its star, JFK impersonator Vaughn Meader, was wildly famous ... until suddenly he wasn’t.   On the premiere of #Mobituaries his fascinating and harrowing story @ApplePodcasts  https://t.co/6XjDsGub0P https://t.co/KtEXmCHWkw

@Faith_Salie @petersagal @mgshn @ckenworthy @waitwait @paulapoundstone @brianbabylon @ChicagoTheatre Jinx!
@petersagal @Faith_Salie @mgshn @ckenworthy @waitwait @paulapoundstone @brianbabylon @ChicagoTheatre I mean, bite our heads off why don’t you, HANNIBAL LECTERN!
@petersagal @Faith_Salie @mgshn @ckenworthy @waitwait @paulapoundstone @brianbabylon @ChicagoTheatre Quit lecterning us!
@Faith_Salie @mgshn @ckenworthy @waitwait @petersagal @paulapoundstone @brianbabylon @ChicagoTheatre Faith! I know you meant to write “small podia”. PLEASE tell me that was a typo!
@mgshn @ckenworthy @Faith_Salie @waitwait @petersagal @paulapoundstone @brianbabylon @ChicagoTheatre The small podium is for NPR quiz hosts what the tight black tee-shirt is for CNN correspondents. Shows off the bod!

Hell hath no fury like a @CBSSunday Morning fan denied the Moment of Nature.   “We leave you now with Sheila from Minneapolis burning Roger Goodell in effigy.”
@thedrewpowell @CBSSunday I’ve always been known more for my power than my speed. I was known as “The Diesel” before John Riggins.
If you’re just tuning into @CBSSunday Morning I’m the one filling in for Melvin Gordon at RB. But don’t underestimate Jane Pauley and the Titans. She’s had 32 tackles this season.

Bill Geist is part of the DNA of @CBSSunday Morning. This morning a tribute to him and all those pieces that only he could do.

@MrDavidGordon Pps Patti (Anna) and Caissie (Elsa) are better than ever in their roles.
@MrDavidGordon Whoa!  I was there last night. I was wondering why a very agitated guy with a MAGA visor was escorted from the theater by security while the rest of us were filing out. (Security handled it very professionally). Ps My mother LOVED the show!

@EenaRuffini Excuse me but that was a three foot stuffed pink EMOTIONAL SUPPORT donut.
@RadioKitty @NewYorker @susanorlean @mnstatefair .@SusanOrlean-on-a-Stick sounds weird. And delicious!
If The @NewYorker wants to appeal to the heartland they should scrap the “festival” and go with the state fair model. Who wouldn’t love to see a Truman Capote butter sculpture?
@emilykennard Yes! Like the last helicopter out of Saigon but with higher stakes, right?
I’m constantly confusing Daniel Boone with Davy Crockett! Which historic figures do you confuse for each other?

@Faith_Salie I’d write more but ... you know ...
@MurphyProducer @CBSInnovationTV Love this picture, John!
I know, Lathe sounds like the name of a prep school lacrosse player who committed some horrific crime. But it’s not. It’s an incredibly important tool, and I’m telling you all about it this morning! https://t.co/RNOqTNZ1eT
Carl Kasell was kind. Not “nice” but KIND. And Gregory Peck dignified but also funny. And well into his 70s, along w/ his beautiful wife Mary Ann, he enjoyed life the way a 25yo is supposed to.  He was one of the warmest and coolest people I’ll ever know. https://t.co/hIryYQkIlq
Let’s settle this once and for all: He looks like a young Val Kilmer.

I interviewed Rex Reed. He has some opinions. Tomorrow on @CBSSunday Morning.
@drtaranarula @CBSInnovationTV @cbstv Ha! If we ever have a producer opening we know who to call...
@greenfield64 This started with supermarket express lanes. “10 or less items” when it should be “10 or FEWER items”!

Tomorrow on @CBSSunday I’m going to do my best to explain Gerrymandering and why it matters so greatly. (I promise it’ll be almost as entertaining as my segment on Cloture).

Mary Hart is having an amazing retirement.
I believe that when he retires - hopefully long in the future - we’ll be forced to confront what’s really bothering us. And we’ll miss him.
I think that Joe Buck understands that people aren’t really angry at HIM.   In fact I think he’s shown grace, turning the other cheek.
People are angry and feel powerless to make the changes urgently needed. And so they complain about Joe Buck.

@tcm Angela Lansbury is so good in The Harvey Girls she can be forgiven for antagonizing Judy Garland's character.

You should get 4 pts for hitting the goal post. It's hard!
If everyone in America had to do this there'd be no obesity problem.
Feeling very Chinese Olympic opening ceremonies.
I like the Broncos but they're so defensive.
If Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't join the halftime show to sing from Country Strong I'm not watching the second half.
How many push-ups did that ref do right before the game?
In real life a bronco would never do that to a panther.

Happy Super Bowl Eve!
Panthers vs Broncos? Pfft. The real contest is this morning on Innovation Nation... https://t.co/IPKz15ZnYX

@Jocelyn3000 I'm very happy to hear that, Jocelyn!
@rebangelbaer Had to leave. Next time, thanks!
@152erica @GusFriedChicken Okra's a vegetable. I love whales too much to eat fried orka :) Chess pie is like butterscotch-y creme brûlée.
Went with all dark meat, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, fried okra and chess pie. Loved it all. Hey @GusFriedChicken, come to NYC!
I've been told this is the best fried chicken I'll ever have. Good sign: line out the door at 11am. #Memphis https://t.co/p3UW6xWxga
@mickdxb one of my favorite episodes. And yes I do stay in touch.
@EllenDontTweet Thank you so much, Ellen. All of us who work on the show have had such a great time.
@ChrisRRegan I love her hair. It's very Bonnie Raitt!
@leonardzax Great idea.
ICYMI I played Doody in the 1993 Southeast Asia tour of Grease.   (If someone in the cast is reading this, please post a pic. Thanks!)
@CameronAdamsNYC Give me a part. Any part. Now. (Seriously I can be the guy that tells people to turn off their phones).
@petersagal It took this for you to finally notice me. And I couldn't be happier. The End!
This guy is looking for a home. And with a name like his, how can he be denied? Read on...  https://t.co/lPoxf4Aw4V https://t.co/0xSEP8XFzm
@DanaSCalvo Love ya back, Dana! I'll take you to Warby Parker to pick out a pair.
@LisaBirnbach Sorry. FAA rules, not mine.
And you don't have to deal with a chatty seat mate. This morning on @CBSInnovationTV https://t.co/vlVnpHtS0G
What? This is what I always wear when I restore historic quilts.  This morning on Innovation Nation @CBSInnovationTV https://t.co/9W7kUlk9CJ
I promise, this is really cool.  https://t.co/WOVDVe5xk5
@RoyPrice And now I'm waiting for someone to set up @DeletedTweets ... which I see already exists.
Yes, please do.  https://t.co/8dyjrpxV4q
@152erica I loooove stuffed animals. The more the better. Thank you, Erica!
@MichaelMayerDIR Thanks, Michael! Bring your Funny Girl to Broadway!
@152erica love it. Thank you, Erica!
@bryantschaefer Hell yeah!
@therieau Loving this!!
I'd love to come back. You're one of my favorite presidential historic sites!  https://t.co/9sagZbYecZ
@RoodonFood Thank you so much for such a nice post! Glad you like the show as much as we love making it.
@mrmattwalsh that's all I needed to hear. The Matt I know is back!
That two point conversion was unnecessary and frankly obnoxious. #karma
@ChrisWragge Cooking Channel money, baby!
This game has so many turnovers, it should be sponsored by Pillsbury!
This game has more turnovers than my pantry!
I'm beginning to think the Cardinals are suffering from Avian Flu!
Is Carson Palmer wearing a fanny pack? Is that where he keeps his Eurail pass for the offseason?
The Cardinals jacket that Bruce Arians is wearing is terrific looking. The red is more muted than on the uniform. I love it!
@andrewzimmern Feel free to tweet me your football-related Qs!
Ok. The Broncos have won the game. That means they're going to the Super Bowl.
Everyone calm down. Let me figure out what's going on and explain it to you.
I think Brady should go for it.
@DnvrWriter @CBSSunday Thanks Deon!
@Edsore2 @CBSSunday @Tony_Dorsett Thanks for the follow!!
@rking96 @CBSInnovationTV I'll get back to you on that.
@EFMoriarty Enough with the murders, Erin. Come out and party! https://t.co/Pp65AzFJzU
Can't complain about the traffic https://t.co/ObFvOILQYl
@Rose_Marie_Holt @jaketapper @HumphreyBogart On it.
@mrmattwalsh how nice of you to offer. But about 50 million of us are trapped in our homes. #Empathy
@ColeEscola please stop the governor shaming
I'm bored. Can Alicia Vikander say something outrageous so we can all tweet about it?
@ColeEscola Wait. Why don't you ask your neighbors if they have a cake pan?
@Beeterz_wear @CBSSunday @Tony_Dorsett I'm not sure. The whole putting a frog in a pot of boiling water thing turned out to be false.
@bandgeekmike oh right. It's very dry.
@Joe9477 I wish!
@PeterGMcDermott hmm I'm not sure what time we air in the Dallas area. @JimLichtenstein?
@LaurieHowley it is! @JimLichtenstein?
@CharliexVxStern @JoeVidulich I do! Thank you!
The whole point of this snowstorm was to force everyone to stay in &amp; watch Innovation Nation on CBS. So quit interrupting, local news!
@bandgeekmike on the inside part of my right knee. I just want to SCRATCH it!
@Thom915 Yes! But I don't want to scratch myself. It'll make it worse.
@Josie614 I'll check
@JoeVidulich I'm sorry but the air is so dry and because of this storm I won't be able to buy moisturizer!
I'm itchy 😁
@SoapBoxMox @CBSInnovationTV Absolutely!!
Your flight is canceled. So relax, watch Innovation Nation on CBS and learn all about the Ford Tri-motor tomorrow!  https://t.co/4t8ImKi3Xu
@tomrapier @CBSSunday @Tony_Dorsett Great picture, Tom!
Cats is coming back to Broadway!  https://t.co/Mafl4FDgCX
@falfans Yup
My goodness Alice Ghostley could sing! (Yes, Alice Ghostley from Bewitched) https://t.co/EnvjcZcEC4
I'm hoping someone can take my last tweet and create a Tom Hardy-Ethel Merman mashup.

@alsilbs @michaeltoulouse Thank you! And might I say you are marvelous in the show. You've made Reb Danny a proud papa!

@152erica my one and only joke! :)
@siestaclaud Thank you, Claudia! Great show, huh?
@KathieEasom @waitwait Thanks Kathie!
@ColeEscola I'm sorry about that. But now there's Facebook!

@Robbrunn Now that deserves a follow! :)
I wish Gael Garcia Bernal's Golden Globe had been delivered to his table via drone.
@katiedoodlebug2 Thanks Katie!
@Jerickaduncan Thanks Jericka!
And yes, I do anything Margo Martindale tells me to  #GoodWife
You would abandon the Good Wife for the Golden Globes? You're worse than Peter Florrick.
Why doesn't Christian Slater have to go through that backstage metal detector?
Tonight I'm on The Good Wife in a performance so compelling it's sure to win a Golden Globe later in the evening.
@152erica @CBSSunday Thanks Erika! She was a very funny lady!

@YULANDAJONES and peace to you. Your comment is much appreciated. And I agree it's hard to say anything meaningful about religion in 140 cha
@YULANDAJONES Thanks for your thoughtful response. I was careful to say "for many" (not all) Christmas Carol = meaning. Merry Christmas!
@152erica @thehenryford Maybe not till summer but hopefully sooner!
@152erica Erica, I loved meeting you at @thehenryford. Merry Christmas!
