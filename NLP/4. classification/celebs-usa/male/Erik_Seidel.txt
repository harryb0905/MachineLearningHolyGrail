It’s likely Trump’s Oval Office address was designed to distract from the story of Manafort’s collusion with Russia. And it worked

@jgray1066 Yemen? He’s not anti-war, he’s been talked out of a few by his advisers. You know who was anti-war, Jimmy Carter, he never dropped a bomb, I assume you’re also a big fan.
@jgray1066 No one is saying he wasn’t elected. Does it give you pause that everyone around him says he’s an idiot, and he has surrounded himself w criminals? Do you think he’s just running bad or could he be a 3rd rate con man? I hope you read the article

@hishga That’s why I tweeted w %’s
@DavidRogers118 Good question, don’t know
The wording on my Trump odds tweet was a little confusing, I’ll try again. His odds were 33% to be re-elected in 2020. He went as high as 40%, now he’s still 36-37% in the betting markets. Takes into account the fact that he may not run
@Brians_Dad No, that’s the price from here, even as it looks &amp; feels like he’s going down the toilet
It’s been interesting watching the fluctuations of Trumps price to be re-elected. It was 2-1 against, moved to -150, now it’s around -170.  Incumbency is worth a lot

Trump Hispanic outreach seems to be working, record turnout! https://t.co/6aUpUWJavi
@BrettRichey She had a small move her way earlier, but within 10 mins of the announcement the change was dramatic. Def was related to Comey
There was a strong reaction to the new Comey announcement at betting sites &amp; now she is back to over 5-1 fav, which matches her high
Small shift so far today in the odds toward Hillary, she's now 3.5-1. Given record Hispanic turnout in FL + NV, thought odds might move more
@e_d_sanders Interesting factor
Are there estimates anywhere of % of GOP &amp; DEM voters who are likely to switch sides
@nodogbite poll numbers starting to come in &amp; time decay bc Trump is running out of time for a turnaround
Comey sent Hillary's odds from over 5-1 fav to 2.3 to 1. Odds have made a big move in HRC's direction today, she's 3-1 fav now
