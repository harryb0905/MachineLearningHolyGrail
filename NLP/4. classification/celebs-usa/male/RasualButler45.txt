Once someone is in compliance with hands up they are no longer a threat
I understand officers have dangerous jobs I have family &amp; friends who work as officers I'm told by them deadly force is 4 extreme cases
I do apologize if I came across as if I condone looting because I don't! I think deadly force should only be used as last as last resort
The curfew as well because it takes away peoples right to protest and I'm also also against looting and rioting but peaceful protest I agree
Let me clarify something when I spoke about the force being inexcusable I was speaking of the Mike brown being shot to death I am against
@MathewSHarrison My Father,Grandfather and Uncle fought for our country also respect &amp; admiration to you and them for that great service!
2 the officers who do their jobs correctly you are appreciated! Those who understand how to use authority and do your best everyday
@MathewSHarrison Be Blessed sir!
@MathewSHarrison look at Msnbc right now black and white together hands up on their knees protesting together
@MathewSHarrison no your sickening not more considered about things rather than a persons life what if he was your son God forbid good day!
@MathewSHarrison I appreciate law enforcement I have family and friends who are officers but they do their jobs correctly within the law
@MathewSHarrison see now your speaking on things you have no idea about which is crossing lines so with that God bless
@MathewSHarrison standing in between the businesses and the looters which showed everyone didn't agree with looting!  Including protesters
@MathewSHarrison would cause the officers to do what would be necessary to enforce peace! I also said the protesters did the right by
@MathewSHarrison no I simply said a curfew could Possibly key word here possibly escalate things because of those who may rebel which
@MathewSHarrison a man was murdered unlawfully but looting is the concern all though I do agree looting is wrong but to be shot? Confused
@MathewSHarrison I absolutely said the rioting was wrong as well as this young man being killed!
Hoping that one day we all could live in peace together Great men and woman right is right and wrong is wrong being murdered 4 stealing tho
The killing has to stop the to piton has to stop and we need to find away to live together in this great country to many have died here
I'm not just a ball player I'm a person and I'm speaking my opinion on My page if you don't like it then get off My page period!
No race or family deserves to deal with that let's talk about why the riots happen not saying it's right but let's look at the big picture
I have a 16 year old daughter and nieces,nephews and cousins and if they made a foolish mistake and stole cigars I don't want them shot!!!!!
Saying no this isn't the way destroy private property I don't condone that neither do I condone black kids being murdered for a petty crime
If that happens now law enforcement would be forced to use force if necessary I feel the community did a good job by standing their ground &amp;
Peaceful protest is absolutely the right thing to do I said curfew can escalate the situation where more people could potentially rebel
No one is speaking about looting or rioting being ok the protesters did what was right they stood in front of the rioters
People want to talk about me being bias and ranting when all i said was unlawful killing needs to stop that type of force was wrong period
It simply has to stop! No more excuses man it's sickening! Now it's a curfew enforced which can… http://t.co/tv3xraKKKW

Ok done I hope I help some ppl today stay aware
Be bold in who u are your are perfectly designed to be you Love yourself respect yourself learn who u are don't allow urself to be cheapened
If someone does something you don't deserve just forgive them and move on in relationships it is a perfect match made for and only u
Be aware listen 2 your spirt go with what u hear it telling you 2 do! It's time 2 walk in your destiny! Don't allow the enemy 2 side track u
It's a shift taking place in the universe GOD'S people are being called! Things you struggled with are no more! That's GOD speaking too u

@anselngretel but according to most of the registered voters they believe Romney won but I thought it was a close debate my Lasalle Brother
@anselngretel Obama did a little better in that area but all in all it was a good debate about even I think just my opinion
@anselngretel I feel u! In my opinion he did a good job explaining some others not so much! Is all I'm saying all votes won't read up on
I Love every1and appreciate every1 for their beliefs and their personal opinions! If I don't agree w/u I still respect u...I ask the same!
Romney never says how he will do the things he's promising he just says he will do it but never says how
Obama still a Blackman he heard something in was on his square lol like what's that forget the debate right now something's behind me lol
@Rudd415 calm cool and collective or calm in collected however u get what I'm saying lol thank u though
Or Obama is Calm and Collected or calm cool and collective however he is that Guy!
Romney trying kill Sesame Street Big bird and Mr. Rogers what the kids gone do without Reading rainbow! Come on!
Romney is not admitting that he has said some of these things he's denying over the last yr

about what does the "C" stand for in OKC in my mentions are wrong. We was playing it was a "JOKE" Laugh we all knows what it stand for.
I RT what @northphilliest tweeted which i know was jacked because he's educated &amp; went to college &amp; played ball with me so the comments CONT
