@mccurdywarp If you see me walking by with a teardrop in my eye, look away! Did I get it right?
@JesseMAC22 It was so fun. Trivia: the guy that directed it, ended up directing The Best Player. Totally random.

@beatlegirlstacy If I haaad to choose a dessert I'd have a brownie with cool whip
@thatprettyrage Cheers! No question about it.
@akdirossi It's very different. Because it's aimed at adults the jokes are different, plus the live audience is energizing!
@l3rittanyNicole Mexican food! Chips, salsa, a taco, an enchilada and a margarita. That combo can turn a day around!
@HannahWOBrien Australia was great! NYC is always a blast, Memphis was life changing

I'm begging you! If you like #WendellandVinnie you have to watch it tonight at 8:30pm on Nick! If you haven't seen it, you will love it!
Last night we shot the final episode of the first season of #WendellandVinnie. Gratz to the entire cast and crew. 20 episodes flew by.
This Thurs. at 10pm come see me and some friends do the “So and So Show” at the @groundlings. It’s gonna be funny and might just be about u!

@KNWZumba unfortunately no, was told they needed to reschedule. It’s still happening but in another couple weeks.
“@WendellVinnie_: Congratulations, @jerrytrainor for your Emmy nomination! https://t.co/Quko8KP38S” Very unexpected, but amazing!
This’ll be the first Thurs episode. It’s a better time slot for our show, which is geared more towards grown ups, but still funny for all!
It’s happening!!! New episode of #WendellandVinnie this Thurs at 8:30 on Nick!
Tonight's taping of #WendellandVinnie was so fun and hilarious! The best crowd ever!
@alexalbrecht @alisonhaislip Now what?! http://t.co/o1dOP1yqAX
That was awesome! I gotta run to dinner. Thanks for all the great questions. I'll try and do this more often. :)
@DanmaNdadrummer I get that a lot. He operates in his own stratosphere of genius, I could never touch it. I always take it as a compliment.
@biancaaddison either Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin.
@Dondoubleu3 It's a big responsibility, and very rewarding. I would sing the crap out of a musical episode!
@DaynaE502 Put on some music and feed my dog.
@BlueNeonPinkie I definitely know it's my destiny to do what I'm doing. Greatness is determined by others, I couldn't say.
@DaynaE502 I loved Family Ties so much! Also was a huge SNL fan.
@childofthemoon_ Um YES!!! Two…minutes…to MIIIIIIIIIIDNIGHT! /headbanging.
@the_jack_staley Anchorman! Not sure I've ever laughed that hard in a theater.
@AwkwardSnowman The live audience! I love love love performing in front of people every week, there's nothing better.
@ohcdee I think @DanWarp kept everything in a secret vault. It's guarded by one of his 30 highly trained attack bunnies.
@childofthemoon_ love em! But I prefer Elvis and the Stones.
@luisjosee1 un poco
@CassieSmith85 three dude!
@jeezriker I actually don't like sweets that much. I'd rather have buffalo wings or baby back ribs, or fries!
@athkat Also Dick Van Dyke!
@athkat Tom Hanks, Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, Chris Farley, amongst many many others.
@CiscoRulz08 Well I love your mom, wait that sounds bad :P
@Jemmelot I know that soul mate is out there, just haven't met her yet.
@OhRonJohn I've done stand up in the past, but I prefer improv. I perform occasionally at @groundlings in LA.
@VinessaWarcraft nope, on to SWTOR now. My buddy roped me back in!
@jennettemccurdz @jennettemccurdy quite simply stunning in every way.
@karistylinson white or as the paint can called it "Latte Creamy Foam". So weird
@hannahdilts Yup!
@Malanie_JB I'm looking at you right now! Working with other actors and brilliant writers, and laughing until it hurts, daily.
@lie_sheet_steel Austin, TX is awesome, NYC of course is fantastic too.
@kaylee_clever I sent Crazy Steve to pay that dude a visit.
@ahnuhleesuh first responders and people that give selflessly.
@nellynel93 I wouldn't doubt it. Not sure when, everyone's really busy now, but if they miss me as much as I miss them then it's inevitable.
@KatieeDawn the color of a sunset.
@EpicElizabeth not asking out the most gorgeous girl in class. Make no mistake, she would've said no, but I didn't ask so I'll never know.
@davidczuba It smells wonderful.
@whackkat Knock knock..
@DaynaE502 I go to my sister and parents for advice. My family is very close, and they'll tell it to me straight.
@SeddieMania I'm Irish, of course I want some of your baked potato! Duh! Get it in my stomach now!
@paulinnedp5678 We didn't want to jump the shark with iCarly. We liked going out on top and with a sweet farewell to the fans.
@jacobkalin I like a beef taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans! Occasionally a green corn tamale is right on time.
Whatever I have a couple minutes. Anyone got any questions? I'll get the ball rolling…I'll be having Mexican food for dinner tonight.
I believe the reason for the change in time is to correspond with the return of W&amp;V premiere episodes in May.
Set your mind-alarms for the 2nd!
I just found out that I’m not doing the live chat with ExtraTV tomorrow, but instead on May 2nd.
Congrats to my buddies involved with @IADmovie http://t.co/77k8ySCyf5

“@DanWarp: @RyanEsau @jerrytrainor Nope, but for sure I'll be watching! :)” Yeah, boss!!!
Walking my dog and listening to the new Frightened Rabbit and it starts to rain. Coincidence? Nope, Frightened Rabbit makes it rain.
I can't believe it's less than a week away. #Wendell&amp;Vinnie

@zandbro let's b honest Ron Pitts isn't human, he keeps the ashes of destroyed homes in his cargo pants!
@zandbro Ron Pitts and Rick Astley will never let you down!
@zandbro I once saw Ron Pitts drive an oil tanker of a cliff into a fighter jet filled with school children!
@Zandbro Ron Pitts loves plane crashes and when oil tankers encounter kindergartens!
Btw @zandbroumand = @zandbro
@zandbroumand I love Ron Pitts' shirts!
@zandbroumand YEAH!!!!!

My wikipedia page is filled with craziness, please add to it as much wierdness as you can think of.
@schnelle would love to but I'm shooting til like midnight.
Off to the first official shoot day.  They have to do a pickup from 7 months ago, so they have to wig me.  Ridiculous looking.

@DannyTRS that's it! I'm never suggesting munchkin again! Up to you guys from now on, I won't be your slave.
@jeffcannata , @alexalbrecht, @dannytrs why doesn't cinco de mayo = munchkin?
@girlhack that looks fantastic.  I love "will hack for makeup".
@DannyTRS now you have to hit me in the nards with a cooking spoon.
@schnelle unfortunately Munchkin's not happening, maybe Arcatraz instead.
@jeffcannata lol, @alexalbrecht blames @dannytrs!
@Rae_of_Sunshine gonna try for Comic-Con if schedule permits.  I'm from SD so any excuse to go is rad.
@girlhack I am on facebook! Gratz on the sweet sword!
@Rae_of_Sunshine suuuure, you're "daughter".  I know it's your favorite show.  But tell your daughter "Spencer says hi!"
Just ordered flowers for mom's day.  I'm a momma's boy.
About to watch Iron Man!
@schnelle , during the strike they dismantled the set and produced a different show.  But we're back!
@mosteinbach ...I'm pregnant...it's yours.
Just got out of a costume fitting, and saw them rebuilding the iCarly stage, it's gonna be awesome going back to work.
Hey @dannytrs, u can only jailbreak a pear phone not a pair phone.

At Katsu-ya with @alexalbrecht, this place is the best!
Ya know what's funny?  Farting.  Just saying.  I'm just saying it's funny.  I mean there are funnier things sure but farting is pretty good.
There was a huge dog adoption fair in the park across from my apt.  Took Shoe for a walk around tons of people and dogs, he loved it.
Just got back from the vet, I think Shoe has a tummy ache.  Now he's passed out in my bed.
@alexalbrecht, now all I want is frickin IN n OUT!
On my way to have coffee in Malibu, gorgeous day today.
Anyone else listening to the new Tokyo Police Club album...amazing!
Coffee, cloudy weather, loving it!  Couldn't let shoe off the leash this morning because the park cops were afoot, now he's all antsy.
Yeah @alexalbrecht, Hitman. Rented it in hi-def on my AppleTV, and chilled out with some mindless action.  Now I'm up with my dog and coffee
Trying to decide between going to a concert and staying in with some Rolling Rocks and watching Hitman.
Right now, I'm playing WoW and discussing the merits of using twitter.
