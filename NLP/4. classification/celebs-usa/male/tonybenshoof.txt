Back is holding strong so far.  However, my favorite dive bar and employment location (Carpenter's of Hugo) has burnt down after 119 years
Cortisone shot went really, really well.   Already feeling better after just a few hours!  Hope everyone has a great Christmas!
New MRI shows L3-L4 herniation...but I'm very optimistic that this one will take the cortisone well (tomorrow morn).
Still in Norway until Thurs...took 9th in World Cup this weekend which was frustrating.   Looking forward to Christmas break.

There's nothing sunny about Altenberg, Germany.
Training this week was pretty rough so 10th place today wasn't bad considering the circumstances...  Looking forward to Altenberg
6th place with a herniated disk.   I'll take it :)
