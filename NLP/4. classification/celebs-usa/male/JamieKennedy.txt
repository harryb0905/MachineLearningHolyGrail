If people don’t understand what Comedy is you need to look no further then Brody Stevens. Brilliant mind, beautiful soul, empathetic heart. A comedian in every sense of the word. He jus couldn’t conquer his demons. Mental illness is no joke. #sorrybuddy #hugeloss #rip ❤️❤️😞😒

@kimmacaskill1 @soulkiss1001 Let’s not make assumptions. It’s definitely changed plot midway thru. Something as a screenwriter she shud kno but maybe her inciting incident changed. #wgacard
@JayManning1977 @UnkaDub @TokerTommy @Albatross @welchjack1 Don’t u have 3 jobs to do before your open mic Professor?
@PartyNapper @PinkkTransAm 👀
@UnkaDub @TokerTommy @Albatross @welchjack1 @JayManning1977 Awwww elitism way to bridge the gap buddy
@PinkkTransAm @TokerTommy And I said it 5 times. I’m defending the ability to say a joke. A joke.  A joke. A joke. Nothing else. A joke at a comedy club.
@PinkkTransAm @TokerTommy We have misogynistic lyrics in some songs. Not to me l. To me they are jokes but in 2019 by your definition of jokes they wud be considered a felony . And I am not talkin about Louis sex crimes I’m talking bout his Comedy don’t switch topics please. #focus.
@PinkkTransAm @TokerTommy But you support misogyny.
@Danipoey Progresss ❤️
@andrewjrivers @TokerTommy Hey Andy!! One of the best comedy clubs in NYC jus retweeted that joke that you said stinks. Should I give them your tape? #igotnothingbuttime. #onalayover
@PinkkTransAm If u @ him he wud be happier. And if you listen to BLOWIN up your a Hypocrite. I’m serious. Don’t listen to it anymore or u will lose all credibility. Ask me why?
@kimmacaskill1 Oh...that escalated quickly. Ur like mad but still cordial. Must be the Brit. Happy New Years to as well
@PinkkTransAm Says the NON comedian. You are out of your logic league Lady. It’s only a joke if it’s funny u forgot to add this part TO YOU. People were laughin a lot and people in twitter also liked it. So I lost a fan. That’s ok. I’ll be ok. We disagree and that’s ok
@Danipoey Has gotten people so angry. But I’m not defending that. I’m looking at it like this. He was a guy in the workplace trying to figure it out. And who knows what the product will be. But if u wanna get mad why aren’t u protesting the audience who clearly gave him a massive thumbs up
@Danipoey Okay readddy??? Louis C.K. is one of the greats because he takes things thatvare so fuckin taboo that not only u wouldn’t talk about but u could never find the humor ever. And he somehow finds a way to get a kernel out of it. I can whole heartily understand why that subject
@kimmacaskill1 This tweet left me perplexed but.. I think I like it
@PinkkTransAm Im not trying to be an authority. Your attacking me. I’m jus exercising my right to express my free speech on my own timeline. You @ me. Remeber? Don’t be mad but I’m gonna go have a peice of 🥓 now.
@PinkkTransAm I am defending his right to tell a joke  A) he was doing it in PRIVATE.  B) the tape was leaked illegally C) motivated to make a change?  Lady I never owned a gun in my life. Only time I ever shot a gun was on a movie set. And how wud u know what I am doing?
@Danipoey Now where does that get us. Jus hurling names.  It’s called civil discourse.
To all those who are outraged by Louis c. K. Why not get your favorite late night host to have him on to DEFEND his material. 🤔. I’m sure he is not scared and i gaurentee it wud be more viral then your “rapping on wakeboards” segment.
@jage750 Etiquette? Bro illegal. Let me ask you this if I went to Strip club and filmed a dancer giving a private dance and put it on line and gave it to a paper. What do u think wud happen to me? Do u think a paper wud run the tape? Or a Burger King. I wud be up on violations.
@jage750 There’s some things I won’t joke about cause I don’t see the humor in them but it doesn’t mean others can’t.  How u kno if something works or not unless u try. I’m jus fighting for the right to try. That is all.
If you think people are gonna be more understanding in 2019, forget it.  We will stick to our own echo chambers. We will become more splintered less understanding and more self righteous the selfie was only the beginning. #newyearsamelies
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 Must of been my bot.  Let me adjust that
@billdawes @andrewjrivers Dude no. U can’t let them off you went to Princeton. U need to educate them.
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 You must really have built up a following if your twitter@numbers are any indication. Alllll night
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 Is your name pot? I’m kettle. Here all night
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 YOU would have to have you AFTRA card for that. Dues are high. Take the L non profesh. I have a flight to catch playing the improv later.
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 Whatever u need to tell yourself. I’ll see u out there in the clubs. Looking forward to mtg u after 15yrs.
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 Entertainer is also what strippers have. Seriously jus take the L. You punching too Up. Gotta reach
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 I don’t even kno what that is. but u can’t call yourself a comedian if you are NOT a professional. not PETTY that’s jus something the IRS will tell you when u fill out your form. Your opinions of Comedy are not accepted since you do NOT do it professionally. U start i finish
Canceling the women’s march for inclusiveness, because there was not enough differnt types of women. Hmmm isn’t that marginalizing and EXCLUDING the women that showed up? Jesus Christ pick your position and stay on task. Your eating your own  #cannibals
@JayManning1977 @JasonEAlt @welchjack1 See the above. Also 15 years of being a comedian. Are we makin a living at this being a comedian? Jus asking for my suicidal friend
@JasonEAlt @JayManning1977 @welchjack1 Basically nothing is off the table brah. Am I slapping down? Or up not sure. Thank you for your time officer 👮‍♀️
@JoeOfTheNorth @neeko1979 @OldGloryHole @ericarhodes Your on that kennedy guys timeline so... let me ask you something your honor?
@anezbitt @kirbiejohnson @patmuldowney Which shows
@kirbiejohnson @anezbitt @patmuldowney I agree. People stopped it because it was to UNPREDICTABLE. Twitter trolls ruined it. U shud lash out
@billdawes Tell that to @andrewjrivers. He is the new mayor of Comedy. Don’t have know?
@andrewjrivers @TokerTommy Hahaha Andrew ur mad for people calling you names and then u say I’m not attacking when u open with “this joke STINKS” Andy I can do this til 2020.  U need to take an L sometimes. Admit something.
@bridgetfenlason Hi bridge
@Albatross @welchjack1 @JayManning1977 Do an Obama joke. He’s powerful. Disagree with ur point.
@JasonEAlt @JayManning1977 @welchjack1 So the dems dont have control of the house? I can’t believe I have to explain that to whatever your name is. Oh yes I can because I never heard of u.  And u know eveythjng because u have a keyboard.
@hbkd1973 @mariopons90 He was doing it in private. Again some SJW taped him without consent of club and put it out there. There is no gaurentee he wud have put for public. But again trying is the new failing. What if we taped u at ur job without u knowing wud u like it
@kirbiejohnson @anezbitt @patmuldowney Let’s be honest
@neeko1979 @LeftDJT 🙌🙌
@JoeOfTheNorth @neeko1979 @OldGloryHole @ericarhodes We have a white knight amoungst us
@ingridostby Is it rascism? Or jokeism? 🤔...
@JayManning1977 @welchjack1 Umm liberals do jokes about old white republicans. How is this punching Up again officer.
I have a new group of marginalized people It’s 2019 and this group needs to be represented.. they’re called COMEDIANS. #wehaverights #stoptheoppression. #notajoke
@andrewjrivers @stackartist @BlueRoomComedy I think the joke was more about hypocrisy then it was Waffle House. I” ll be sure to run my references by you next time. Maybe I’ll add some more references to Siri. Nobody does that your honor.  I mean at some point I gotta 🚿 bro
@andrewjrivers @stackartist @BlueRoomComedy It’s trending for many reasons. And within that trend they’re is a TON of support for jokes and the laughs were good. So agree to disagree.
@AllAboutFKK It’s bizarre to me. Ask them
@andrewjrivers @stackartist @BlueRoomComedy Touché. But let’s  be honest about honesty. U not liking a joke isn’t honest it’s your opinion. Let’s be honest.
@andrewjrivers @stackartist Dude remeber when u were elected the Mayor of Comedy? I didn’t get that ballot. I wud love to keep debating u on this topic but I have some boring jokes to tell for 2 soldoutshows for Ny eve @BlueRoomComedy. In 2019 I wud suggest a course in Networking.  #hecklerorcomedian.
@andrewjrivers I remeber it was in Tacoma. Well that’s ur opinion. I heard Big laughs and he is workin it out. Jesus do u not remeber what it’s like to TrY jokes. I mean bro we disagree but pick a side he was doing it in private. U can’t be critic and comic.
@andrewjrivers Dude aren’t u a comedian?
@Jinx1981 Hahah see that’s funny. Jokes if effective always win
He was doing it in a club. That’s the point a comedy Club. That’s the safe zone for comedians. The guy who taped his set violated the rules. Hes the one who put it out there not Louis. 👀
@jeremymstamper 🤣🤣🤣
Getting mad at a man for trying jokes at a comedy club is like getting mad at butter for having saturated fat at a Waffle House.
How many people will bring up the greatest New Yrs eve show ever attempted tonight? 6 yrs and you stilll talk about it. Mission accomplished

@findoursisters @Elyssamai OMG if she is gender shaming u.  U career shaming me. U don’t get a cookie if u hate. Reap what u sew. Like did u go to high school. #brainshamingyou
@lee_g_b @XzOtiCaNdY @kathygriffin ok I was wrong bout that. Thought it was at a comedy club. I was wrong. But Kevin is a great guy so I assume he was jus tryin a joke.
@lee_g_b @XzOtiCaNdY @kathygriffin You cannot like the joke. But this is the whole argument.  What is said in jest is jus that jest.If he said it in non comedic setting then ur point wud be more valid. That’s why I’m arguing ur saying a joke u don’t like is hate speech and I’m jus saying it’s a joke u don’t like.
@findoursisters @Elyssamai If my career is D list. Her brain capacity is F list.  We WINN!!!
@lee_g_b @XzOtiCaNdY @kathygriffin So your saying that KEVIN wud break a dollahouse over his head? DO u actually beleive that. He did the joke in a comedy club. That’s the place to JOKE. It’s more obviously a joke there then any other setting.
@BlGKAHUNA @findoursisters I’m she jus said that it sparks “feral for safety above. Read what she wrote
@lee_g_b @XzOtiCaNdY @kathygriffin Yea she DIDNT do it. Jus like Kevin didn’t break a dollhouse over his sons head. Come on man, Kevin’s was a joke jus like Kathy’s was a joke
@findoursisters And that’s your opinion and that’s ok. But again u will never get heard by jus insulting people, hence why u don’t understand humor.
@findoursisters Your worried about being attacked but the first thing u did was attack me and my career. Unprovoked So is hypocrisy rampant here?  #served
@findoursisters It’s a JOKE!!!  What don’t u get. IS he actually breaking the dollhouse over his sons head? Did he actually do that? No. hence JOKE.  What’s not clicking for u?
@TheGarofaholic He shouldn’t have to apologize. It’s a joke. U don’t like it but it’s a joke.
@findoursisters That’s your opinion. Why can’t u jus agree to disagree. Why u so mad
@lee_g_b He wouldn’t do that. That’s why it’s a joke bro.  A joke a joke ajoke. Not stand up literally. Stand up comedy.
as I was reading about #KevinHart , he jus stepped down. WOW!!!  This is it. We have reached the tipping point. Like I said before I will say it again the words “ IT WAS JUS A JOKE” will soon be Extinct.

"Did he really put her liver in the mailbox, because I heard he put her liver in the mailbox" Jk in SCREAm inspired by ZEUS. #RIPJerryLewis
...anyone who has ever worked in comedy should bow they're heads today. He inspired me too many times to name....
..not only that. But the world of film. He was responsible for many things we have today. The first person to ever use video playback...
The world has lost the ZEUS of comedy. There's not one person in comedy who his influence hasn't touched. He was KING of the mountain....
Hes on the Rushmore of comedy. #RIPDickGregory
