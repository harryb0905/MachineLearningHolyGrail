WEDNESDAY: Looking forward to chairing a bipartisan Florida congressional delegation hearing with @RepHastingsFL on water quality issues such as red tide and algae blooms. #Sayfie https://t.co/zzq29yklDZ
Ahead of next week’s #TrumpKimSummit in #Vietnam, I am urging @POTUS to demand the swift and complete repatriation of thousands of American soldiers killed in the Korean War. Via @ConnectingVets https://t.co/rfYwd7GZXo
Our soldiers and their families living on military bases should not be subjected to squalid conditions and health hazards like mold and lead.  I've launched an inquiry with the Air Force and will continue to demand answers. Via @BN9 #Sayfie https://t.co/zlk034ZjIN
If no Member of Congress got paid during a shutdown you can bet this wouldn’t happen again. Stop paying Congress if they can’t do their job. Via @mysuncoast #sayfie https://t.co/rjBtgfek3F
Great meeting with Sarasota and Manatee County officials to discuss the importance of local infrastructure, water quality issues, and flood insurance. #Sayfie https://t.co/vNgBeGYtJP
Members of Congress shouldn’t get paid if they don’t do their job. That’s why I co-sponsored a bill to block paychecks for senators and congressmen during any future government shutdowns. I just donated my pay during the recent shutdown to three local charities. #Sayfie https://t.co/GUbPHSjM2m
Anti-Semitism has no place in this country, let alone in the halls of Congress. Michigan congresswoman Ilhan Omar should apologize for her hateful and offensive remarks about Jewish money influencing public policy. Via @TimesofIsrael https://t.co/scfrLZkB2g
Great to see Manatee County Commissioner Vanessa Baugh’s appointment to this important commission. I look forward to working with her to combat red tide algae. #Sayfie https://t.co/5E8nvhfG3c
With my strong support, the House just passed a critical bill to fight sex trafficking. Thank you to #Sarasota's Elizabeth Fisher and her organization @SelahFreedom for all of their efforts to combat this horrific form of modern-day slavery. #Sayfie https://t.co/nnQMqgFu8w
Today, I visited the Humane Society of Manatee County to promote the PACT Act, which makes animal cruelty a federal crime. My colleague, Democrat @RepTedDeutch also promoted our bipartisan bill at Broward County Animal Care and Adoption. #Sayfie https://t.co/oSweSdYYIu https://t.co/GEGUyrhbOi
As the top Republican on the congressional committee that oversees international trade, I will fight for #Florida farmers to counter #Mexico's unfair trade policies. #Sayfie @bradentonherald https://t.co/GgyEAtlcCB

The slaughter of horses for consumption is a barbaric practice that has no place in America. I will continue to lead the effort with @RepSchakowsky to ban domestic horse slaughter and end the export of horses abroad for the same purpose. #Sayfie https://t.co/Kp1cpHJwiM
The torture of animals should be a federal crime with stiff penalties. My bill with Democrat @RepTedDeutch ​has overwhelming bipartisan support. Glad this issue is receiving the attention it deserves. #Sayfie #FlaPol https://t.co/4bhtud7KtL
Simplifying the federal financial aid process is critical to allowing more students to attend college. Democrat @RepLloydDoggett and I introduced the Student Aid Simplification Act to make it happen. #Sayfie  https://t.co/Gpj45ekmpz
I will continue to fight for our veterans and demand accountability from the @DeptVetAffairs. It is unacceptable that 22 American veterans take their lives every day. @mysuncoast #Sayfie https://t.co/CuoemNmXod
Praying for all victims and their families tonight following this senseless tragedy. Thank you to the first responders, including Sebring Police Department and the Highlands County Sheriff’s Office, for your response and ongoing efforts. #Sayfie  https://t.co/RWhdCrlcGi
The torture of innocent animals is abhorrent and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Protecting animals from cruelty is a top priority for me and I look forward to working with Democratic @RepTedDeutch on this important issue. #Sayfie https://t.co/CLza5Wfu8t
It was an honor to deliver the keynote address at @KeiserU's commencement this past weekend. I appreciate the opportunity to address 300 graduates and wish them the best as they transition to become our next generation of leaders. #Sayfie https://t.co/bNb8ZRToBZ
Good to see the President offer a bipartisan olive branch to end the government shutdown. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer need to come back to the bargaining table.
Today, I will be giving the keynote address at @KeiserU's statewide graduation, which begins at 11 AM. #Sayfie Watch here: https://t.co/m0CWJtjleB
Terribly saddened to hear that we lost Purple Heart recipient and Floridian Jonathan R. Farmer in Syria. It is a solemn reminder that freedom is not free. I join #Florida and the rest of the nation in praying for his family. https://t.co/Xo9LIJKolh
Yesterday, I met with @USTradeRep Robert Lighthizer to discuss trade priorities for #Florida and the nation. Our trading relationship with #China has been anything but fair trade, and I look forward to working with the administration to hold Beijing accountable. #Sayfie https://t.co/3B6bi8N2vj
Fix this injustice against Vietnam veterans and restore health benefits for thousands denied coverage for Agent Orange exposure! Pass the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. #Sayfie https://t.co/IFNlnlL3iZ
Just named the top Republican on the trade committee in the U.S. House. International trade is critical to #Florida, where exports &amp; imports support 2.3 million jobs. Through 15 deepwater seaports, Florida exports tens of billions of dollars in goods and services annually #Sayfie https://t.co/fQh3kccFhD
I applaud @GovRonDeSantis’ focus on water quality for #Florida. The Sunshine State's future depends on clean water. I also urge him to include efforts to combat red tide in his proposed Blue-Green Algae task force. #Sayfie https://t.co/Tn0TycIJXx
Praying for my friend and Florida delegation co-chair @RepHastingsFL. He is a true champion for our state and will bring the same fighting spirit in his battle against this illness. https://t.co/twMo0sMWch
This weekend, I held my first town hall of 2019 in Hillsborough County. Great turnout and terrific discussion of important issues like veterans benefits, the federal debt, immigration and the government shutdown. #Sayfie https://t.co/BNfucnkC8M
Great to see @POTUS signed bipartisan legislation to provide $100 million to combat harmful algae blooms, including red tide. #Sayfie https://t.co/lFPD424PgD
On #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay, let us thank these heroes for always protecting our communities. I call on Congress to stand with our first responders and pass the #ThinBlueLine Act. #Sayfie https://t.co/vxb9g1hXBS
No oil spills here. Today, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in introducing a bill to ban drilling off #Florida. #Sayfie https://t.co/rwP47DUttr
Why is @TheJusticeDept giving YOUR taxpayer dollars to the anti-Semitic Nation of Islam? I am demanding that the Dept. of Justice halt all payments to this hate group. #Sayfie https://t.co/GqZgbl50WI
On opening day, we continued our fight for #Florida by introducing seven bills to help veterans, farmers, first responders and others. #Sayfie https://t.co/VqswgqxdA5
As co-chair of the #Florida delegation, protecting agriculture is a bipartisan priority for me. Today, @SenRubioPress @RepAlLawsonJr and I introduced a bill to counter unfair trade practices by #Mexico that hurt Florida farmers. #Sayfie https://t.co/rTyoPrAcdn
As the new Congress gets underway, I will be focused on issues important to our region – red tide, social security, veterans’ benefits and the opioid crisis. We have an ambitious agenda for 2019. #Sayfie https://t.co/GuPgacTA9y
Enemies of the Jewish State of #Israel have used UNESCO to advance anti-Israel measures. Glad the U.S. pulled out of this corrupt body. Thank you to @NikkiHaley for your leadership to combat this biased agenda at the United Nations. https://t.co/k3iQI93f74
Another reminder of the perils America’s police officers face, even on Christmas Eve. The #ThinBlueLine answers the call to protect our communities. @PBCountySheriff mourning the sacrifice of #K9Cigo, who is crediting with saving lives. #Sayfie  https://t.co/9L1LOfDCet
We are able to enjoy our holiday season because of our brave service members on duty here &amp; around the world. Let us remind them that although they may be far in distance, they are close in our hearts. Thank you for protecting America. Merry Christmas! https://t.co/cFPSzjFmjy
I will not be accepting any pay for as long as the federal government remains shut down. This is yet another sad example of Washington’s dysfunction and inability to compromise. #Sayfie https://t.co/2JsTev0jwk
As co-chair of the #Florida congressional delegation, I worked with colleagues to get $100 million to combat algae blooms and red tide on the president's desk. #Sayfie https://t.co/t2pxc2qk9a
The First Step Act will make communities safer by strengthening rehabilitation programs so that prisoners who leave jail don’t return to a life of crime. Our justice system should be tough but fair. https://t.co/9QfHqcqCeR
Good to see bipartisanship is not dead in Washington. Congress overwhelmingly passed with my support a bill to reform the criminal justice system and save taxpayers money.
I am demanding answers from @DeptVetAffairs after it was reported that it failed to spend millions of dollars allocated for suicide prevention efforts in 2018. Unacceptable &amp; disgraceful to the millions of veterans nationwide who put their lives on the line protecting our freedom https://t.co/zk8whVPQhy
This report’s findings are a disgrace to our veterans who put their lives on the line protecting our freedom. I will be demanding answers from the @DeptVetAffairs and taking action in Congress to address these failures. https://t.co/eosbR3atoa
Major Matthew Golsteyn potentially facing the death penalty is DRACONIAN. He is a decorated war veteran who protected American and Afghan soldiers fighting alongside him. Good to see President Trump is reviewing his case. https://t.co/f0vttF3mtc

Important development in the fight to curb opioid abuse — China, the No. 1 supplier of illegal Fentanyl, agrees to designate the deadly drug as a controlled substance. Those selling Fentanyl to the United States will now be subject to China’s maximum penalty under the law. https://t.co/EdfKqlq3Xq
George H.W. Bush was an American patriot, a man of tremendous character and a devoted husband and father. He was the very definition of a public servant. My condolences go out to the Bush family.
Against my strong objections, the U.S. House just voted to strip protections for the endangered Gray Wolf. Scientists and conservation experts should manage wildlife recovery, not Washington politicians. Fortunately the bill will not clear the Senate. https://t.co/xVuOHaUESI
I’m calling for an immediate investigation into the Veterans Affairs Dept. for resuming cruel and inhumane experiments on dogs. It’s time to end this canine house of horrors where the spinal cords of dogs are severed to test their cough reflex. https://t.co/FYWOkBzRHE
Honored to receive a 100 percent grade from @HumaneSociety for my record this year defending wildlife and preventing animal cruelty. Protecting threatened species like the manatee and Florida panther should be a bipartisan issue important to all of us. https://t.co/HzhhDCwtAK https://t.co/aA9N7ydWfc
Today’s shooting at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh is a vile act of hatred that has no place in our country. Anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated anywhere, anytime.
The person responsible for this appalling attack targeting former President Obama and others should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Acts of political terrorism like this cannot be tolerated.
A decision by the Interior Dept. to weaken oil rig safeguards must be reversed. After the devastation of red tide, the last thing we need is another massive oil spill like Deepwater Horizon. https://t.co/YTUdtHTYPZ
U.S. House about to pass two animal protection bills outlawing dog and cat slaughter sponsored by @RepHastingsFL and myself. Both are backed by the Humane Society of the United States and the Animal Wellness Foundation. See my release here: https://t.co/52rQhfJmKq
On the 17th anniversary of 9/11 we remember the nearly 3,000 killed as well as their families and the incredible heroism of first responders. Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. Special Forces 10 years after the attack https://t.co/fmGkGyhmVt
The Associated Press reporting consumer confidence is at its highest level since 2000. https://t.co/ZPNGmd8l75

The African Elephant is one of the most intelligent and majestic creatures in the world. Sadly, poaching and loss of habitat could lead to their extinction by 2030. We need to pass the Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act to protect them. https://t.co/zRJx5ZQDBV https://t.co/TyjXhqqnOo

I just sent a letter to SBA Administrator Linda McMahon calling for a red tide disaster declaration. Our local businesses need help recovering from the crisis. https://t.co/q3R3drhAYt
John McCain was a true American patriot who sacrificed much for his country. He was a man of tremendous courage and will be missed.
Thank you Governor Scott for requesting federal aid to help with red tide. Southwest Florida’s economy depends on a clean and healthy ocean. https://t.co/chXvQ3bPIT
Visited Mote Marine Lab today and talked with senior scientist Dr. Richard Pierce about ways to combat red tide. Our beaches are one of the region's greatest treasures and must be protected at all costs. https://t.co/VIOpccJvZf
The Trump administration must immediately withdraw its plan to weaken the Endangered Species Act. The proposal amounts to an assault against nature and will lead to the extinction of wildlife. Read my letter to Secretaries Zinke and Ross here: https://t.co/AnqpVpAphJ
The Endangered Species Act must not be weakened! This isn’t Hollywood — once a species is extinct it’s gone forever. Interior’s new proposal is very troubling.
After reports of misconduct at VA nursing homes surfaced, I called for a congressional inquiry. I’m pleased to report that a U.S. House committee has decided to investigate. Heads must roll for anyone who mistreated our aging veterans. https://t.co/uF3wAZ0dmV
Russia is not our friend. There is no dissent inside U.S. intelligence agencies about the conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election. We need to take steps to prevent such interference in the future.
People have a right to know what's in their food. The federal Ag Dept. should go back to the drawing board and create clear labeling guidelines for foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). https://t.co/bS46SxrtB4
Visited with Mote Marine today to discuss the huge problem of red tide. People move to FLA because of our beautiful beaches. We need to know more about the toxins in red tide that are killing sea life and threatening human health. https://t.co/GeW44oqskc
Congressman Charlie Crist and I just sent a letter urging Interior Dept. to keep Deepwater Horizon safety rules. Our bipartisan letter is signed by 21 FLA members. We should not abandon protections adopted after the worst environmental catastrophe in history. https://t.co/mFZOPOkYJI
Shocking report by USA Today and Boston Globe of misconduct and gross negligence at VA nursing homes. I just called on two congressional committees to investigate. Heads must roll!! Read my letter here. https://t.co/e8FYiwzLYR
Glad to see the Supreme Court uphold the travel ban on people trying to enter the U.S. from terror hotspots. Fix the vetting process and secure the borders. The safety of Americans must come first.
The President did the right thing by signing an executive order to keep families together at the border. Children should not be separated from their parents. We can still enforce the laws and secure the border without causing undue hardship to young children.
Children should not be separated from their parents at the border. Enforce the laws, secure the border, keep families together during the review process and expedite the judicial ruling.

Great to have local businessman John Horne of Bradenton, FLA testify before my Tax Policy Subcommittee today to discuss the positive benefits of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. John used the tax cut to give bonuses to workers and buy new equipment. https://t.co/1ce71iJSTk
Congress needs to pass the “Right to Try Act” this week giving terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs. People should be allowed to take a chance on promising treatments, especially when those drugs have cleared basic safety tests. https://t.co/972fB76z3T
Manatee Memorial Hospital making big strides in fighting the opioid epidemic by switching to safer alternatives. Very positive results. Keep up the great work! https://t.co/ktpwSzMiUX
Bipartisan unity today at Florida delegation hearing I chaired with Alcee Hastings on offshore drilling. As I said in the hearing, our local economy was devastated by the Deepwater Horizon spill and I don’t see any light between Republicans and Democrats on this issue. https://t.co/XLrtL9yEAv
Talking with two of the witnesses before today’s delegation hearing on offshore drilling. Brig. Gen. Evan Dertien and Mark Alderson of the Sarasota Estuary Program. We all oppose allowing oil rigs off of Florida’s coast. https://t.co/CNx7LGGhBD

Gina Haspel should be confirmed as the first woman head of the CIA. She is tough, experienced and backed by former Obama intelligence officials. The fact that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, mastermind of 9-11 attacks, opposes her nomination even more reason. https://t.co/giXEztRQVl https://t.co/LNYn9vIWcl
The Iran nuclear deal is one of the worst and most one-sided transactions in U.S. history. President Trump was right to withdraw. Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has a history of cheating on international arms inspections. https://t.co/zb0xQB88WS
Congress should reject a White House plan to cut funding from the Children’s Health Insurance Program. There are plenty of other places to cut. Eleven years ago I voted to override then-President Bush’s veto of a bill extending the program. https://t.co/t0WPMFPnHz https://t.co/cylYEi1ANh
A new study ranked me one of the most bipartisan members in Congress -- top 15 percent in U.S. House. Nothing is impossible if we work together. We need more civility and less partisanship in Washington. https://t.co/5PXRPpE8oB

I just called on Governor Scott to direct new federal anti-drug funds to Manatee and Sarasota counties --two of the hardest-hit counties in Florida.  So many overdose deaths in Manatee that at one point the morgue ran out of space. Read my statement https://t.co/svCv6j0Imr https://t.co/yFKJC9c32G
The Trump administration decision to undermine safety rules for offshore oil drilling is reckless and unacceptable. Have we learned nothing from the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe? These safeguards should remain in place. #Sayfie https://t.co/rTh1kURG6I
Trump administration now allowing elephant and lion trophy "imports" on case by case basis. Bad decision. Should stick to previous commitment to keep ban in place. Allowing "trophies" will only encourage slaughter of these magnificent animals. #Sayfie https://t.co/BlU4qfBwGY
Today is the 8th anniversary of the worst environmental disaster in US history — the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration’s plan to weaken safety rules put in place after the fatal explosion must be withdrawn. https://t.co/xj25SdBGPQ
A federal ban on slaughtering dogs and cats for human consumption was just approved by a U.S. House committee. The bill was introduced by my colleague @RepHastingsFL and myself and is strongly supported by animal welfare groups. #Sayfie https://t.co/HPP6jokMEz
My new bill, the Opioid Emergency Response Act, was endorsed today by hospital officials, mental health experts, sheriffs and two prominent mothers who lost their sons to the opioid epidemic. Honored to have their support. #sayfie https://t.co/bP35EVDb0S
The strike against Syria by U.S., British and French forces was a measured response to Bashar al-Assad’s use of internationally banned chemical weapons. Important not to escalate our role in the conflict or provoke Russian military action. #sayfie

Kudos to @FLGovScott and the Florida Legislature for taking action against the opioid epidemic.   More than 64,000 people died last year from drug overdoses, the leading cause of death among Americans under 50. #sayfie
Tragic news out of Florida International University. Praying for this community and all affected by the deadly collapse of a pedestrian bridge connecting the campus with the city of Sweetwater.

Another fumble by the National Football League, which refused to allow a   veterans group to run a "Please Stand" ad during the Super Bowl.  NFL calls the ad, which refers to the national anthem, political.  I call their action censorship. What do you think? #sayfie https://t.co/RPrLvT9sgx
No more shutdowns -- this type of political brinksmanship is unhealthy and no way to run a country. Congress needs to learn from this mistake and never forget we work for the people.
The failure to prevent a shutdown is unacceptable, but I'm hopeful a compromise can be reached this weekend. Congress needs to do its job. This is no way to run the country.

The President's comment disparaging impoverished nations was wrong and inappropriate. As someone who grew up in a blue-collar household, I don’t believe we should ever denigrate anyone or any country that is economically disadvantaged.
Just named Ways and Means Tax Policy Chairman. I look forward to playing a leading role in developing tax policies that grow the economy and create jobs. #sayfie

Reckless, misguided and potentially catastrophic to Florida. Our economy, environment and way of life is at stake if oil drilling is expanded on Florida’s coastlines. #sayfie https://t.co/zUIjnhDSf7
.@SecretaryZinke today discussing expansion of offshore oil + gas drilling. Not acceptable to include Gulf of Mexico off Florida’s coast!  And Zinke must reject plans to gut safety rules implemented after Deepwater Horizon disaster. Short memory = recipe for disaster. #sayfie
Have we forgotten Deepwater Horizon so soon?  The Interior Department’s reckless proposal to roll back oil drilling safety regulations is a recipe for disaster. #sayfie https://t.co/uoDLXZxHB9
The Interior Department’s plan to weaken safety rules for offshore oil drilling is rash and reckless.   Have we forgotten the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe so soon?  If Secretary Zinke doesn’t withdraw this plan then Congress must intercede. #sayfie

Washington must stop the spending! Congress must pass a Balanced Budget Amendment!
Spending Insanity: National debt total from 1789-1985= $1.5 Trillion.... 2010 Deficit alone = $1.5 Trillion.
Spending Insanity: Last year’s deficit = $1.4 Trillion. Combined total of every surplus in U.S. history = $602 Billion
Spending Insanity: If you add up EVERY budget surplus in US history, it would total less than half of last year’s deficit.
