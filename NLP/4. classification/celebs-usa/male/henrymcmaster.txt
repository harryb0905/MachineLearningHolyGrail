His enthusiasm is infectious, his vision bright and bold, his passion and energy transformative, and his heart as big as the horseshoe. Carolina stands taller than ever on the national and worldwide stage because of Harris Pastides.
Under Harris Pastides’ leadership, the University of South Carolina has achieved 217 years worth of “firsts” in just one decade. It has been an era of unparalleled success.
S.C. businesses and taxpayers have been well served by action taken today by the Senate, and the leadership shown by the House earlier this year, on tax conformity. I ask the House to concur with the Senate so that I can sign this bill into law before the end of this week.
It is an honor to receive the endorsement from @NFIB. With hundreds of thousands of South Carolinians employed by small businesses, we must have leaders that understand low taxes, less regulation, and more innovation are what we need to be successful and accelerate growth. https://t.co/taGACHqQhG

As we diligently prepare for Hurricane Florence, please take a moment to pause and remember the lives we lost 17 years ago today. We honor the legacy of the American heroes who ran toward danger, exhibiting the utmost bravery and patriotism. We will #NeverForget

We just wrapped up our first conference call with emergency response leaders from across the state. Team South Carolina is ready to respond, please make sure you and your family take steps to be prepared as well. Visit https://t.co/wa9vkSEPfL for the latest. https://t.co/iJkFEuyD6x
Please don’t wait until the last minute to start preparing. Make sure you have a plan now. It’s better to be prepared for a storm that misses us than to be caught without plan. Download the @SCEMD app or visit https://t.co/kHg3osPHyH for the latest updates https://t.co/FRBBmKEB2c
We also honored law enforcement, often the first to the scene, whose hard work and dedication has resulted in 450 individuals alive today who would have died from overdoses had the officers not arrived, properly assessed the situation, and promptly administered naloxone. (4/4)
and the General Assembly passed nine bills that I happily signed to bolster our efforts to fight this scourge. (3/4)
I signed an executive order creating the S.C. Opioid Response Team, which developed our state Opioid Response Plan; my executive budget included $10 million for treatment, education, and prevention, which was approved by the General Assembly; (2/4)
The 2018 Governor’s Opioid Summit gave us the opportunity not only to discuss solutions to the issues still facing us, but also to celebrate the progress that has been made in the past year. (1/4) https://t.co/lFG2HwOhrg

Today we are remembering the life of John McCain. Sailor, Senator, father, husband, hero, and friend. Please take a moment to remember his legacy and all that he meant to our country when you look up and see the flags at half staff today. https://t.co/6dr4JTvIrI
James Smith believes that raising your taxes is the "right thing to do." But I want to cut your taxes &amp; keep your hard-earned money in your wallet where it belongs. https://t.co/NwpFJjOClT
We had a fantastic time at @RepJeffDuncan’s Faith &amp; Freedom BBQ tonight. Every year this event brings together conservatives from across South Carolina, and after seeing the crowd tonight, I am confident we have a strong team to take us to victory in November! https://t.co/2qYCVPq4da
Reid Lehman has lived a life of service to others, particularly through his work at @MiracleHill, which has impacted the lives of countless men, women, and children. It was my honor to confer upon him the Order of the Palmetto today. https://t.co/TWWv9Nr6Wh
I will never forget John McCain. He was among the greatest of men, and he was my friend. I hope his family can find comfort in knowing that he inspired the lives of generations of Americans, young and old.
James Smith has FAILED South Carolina. He supports government-run health care that would cost taxpayers $32 TRILLION, but he can't say how we'd pay for it. South Carolinians can't afford James' liberal agenda. https://t.co/L1hU2z5lOL
I was happy to be joined by the mayors of several of our coastal communities to sign a bill that ensures that we respect property lines without compromising conservation to continue to make South Carolina the best place to live for generations to come.
People all over the world come to South Carolina for our wonder, irreplaceable natural resources, including our beautiful beaches, and many of them choose to live here. https://t.co/GqAzEk7afY
James Smith has FAILED South Carolina. He refused to vote on legislation to cut rates for power customers. I am proud of my track record of fighting for ratepayer relief. https://t.co/0pzdxaL7eu
We’re continuing to make South Carolina the best place to work and do business. I was proud to sign a bill today creating an applied baccalaureate degree in our technical college system, allowing us to strengthen our already great workforce. https://t.co/vx7m0Wived
Thank you, @real_wylieshaw! https://t.co/PwbehzPO9E
Santee Cooper acted illegally in canceling their scheduled meeting. It is a shameful attempt to thwart efforts to increase accountability and transparency at this rogue state agency, and we demand answers. https://t.co/hCgHWKGmbq
This is exactly why I appointed Charlie Condon, the legally certified chairman of the board. He will get the agency back on the task that they should have been doing all along—prioritizing its customers. (2/2)
It is sad that Santee Cooper is continuing to act as a rogue agency, with entrenched executives who would rather procrastinate and obfuscate in order to protect their own interests rather than those of the ratepayers. (1/2) https://t.co/8IWoysedtW
Thank you for your kind words, Ambassador.   Please read David Wilkins’ op-ed in the @GreenvilleNews to learn more about how we are working with the Administration to protect South Carolina industry 👇🏻 https://t.co/jfHOYgyYKP

Proud to stand with Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services Director Jerry Adger to announce that his agency is the very first parole agency in the nation to receive full law enforcement accreditation from CALEA. https://t.co/uYLdiNQxx2
Our economy is strong and getting stronger! I am proud to lead Team South Carolina as we work with officials from around the world to bring businesses to our state. Today's announcement marks more than $7 billion in capital investment since I've been your governor. https://t.co/u4aoocAV7K

Peggy and I are hoping for a fast recovery for @GregHembree and we ask that you lift him and his family up in prayer tonight and in the days ahead.
It was my honor to present the Order of the Palmetto to one of the most revered investigators in S.C. law enforcement’s storied history. Pete Logan has served our state and protected our great country for over 50 years, and I can think of no one more deserving. https://t.co/OZJqnEuVBq
Thank you for representing our ticket today, @PamelaEvette! This is the winning team; with strong leadership and partnerships with our local elected officials we will continue to work hard to ensure South Carolina is the best place to work, live, and raise a family. https://t.co/Q2OFToFT42
As you look at the flag today and see it at half-staff, please take a moment to remember Sergeant First Class Christopher A. Celiz, who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in Afghanistan, and pray for his family and friends as they, and our entire state, mourn his loss.
Democrats in the Senate should do what is right for the country and join their Republican colleagues in confirming Judge Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court session begins in October. (3/3)
President Trump promised to nominate conservative judges who will strictly follow the Constitution and exercise restraint rather than activism, and once again he has done just that. (2/3)
I have no doubt that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will make an outstanding Justice of the Supreme Court and will strictly defend the rule of law. (1/3)
Last Tuesday, with your votes and the help of thousands across our great state, we won a tough campaign against worthy competition. As we approach the November elections, we must continue our fight to keep #SCWinning. As your governor, I will never stop fighting for you! https://t.co/gi24fY6CBk

I just spoke with Katie’s husband, Rob. We are shocked by the news of her accident and urge all South Carolinians to keep her in their prayers. She is a strong, determined woman. We need her, and she will pull through.

While no amount of time will fully remove the grief we have over those we lost, may their deaths serve as a reminder that in seemingly impossible circumstances, the grace of God will see us through. (3/3)
In the following days and weeks the nation watched as the people of Charleston, led by the example of the families of the victims, responded to hate with love, grace, and forgiveness. I had people tell me they didn't know what it truly meant to be a Christian until then. (2/3)
Three years ago today we lost nine precious lives at Mother Emanuel at the hands of a stranger they welcomed in with open arms. (1/3)
President @realdonaldtrump has dealt with lies like this on the campaign trail &amp; now in the White House from Democrats &amp; Never Trump’ers. I was with him from the beginning &amp; I’ve seen it all; it was just as appalling then as it is now. https://t.co/P7jmDA8Toc
Those jobs, and the low unemployment rate that comes with them, mean more opportunities for South Carolinians, bigger paychecks, and more of them.
South Carolina just keeps winning. We have announced over 20,000 new jobs across the state, more South Carolinians are working now than ever before, and we just announced a nearly 18-YEAR LOW unemployment rate! https://t.co/HqLrGTHizL

This morning I met with the staff of Daybreak Lifecare Center and pro-life leaders to stand up against the abortion machine that is Planned Parenthood. They are running ads attacking me because they see me as a threat to their existence—and they should. https://t.co/lmHp8JkfCQ
I just spoke to our friends at WYFF to offer my condolences on behalf of all South Carolinians for the tragic loss of these two young men. It is with heavy hearts that Peggy and I lift up our prayers tonight. https://t.co/YU4ZEWrCr7

This is what we're up against.   I've been fighting to protect the lives of unborn babies for decades.

Their presence in North Charleston is about as welcome as a Category 5 hurricane. With more South Carolinians working today than at any other time in history, we aren’t going to let out-of-state labor unions ruin the wonderful working environment in our state. (2/2)
South Carolina is great because of our great people. The Boeing Company recognized this fact, and that’s why they’ve invested so heavily in our state. Out-of-state union bosses have no interest in the future of South Carolina or this remarkable company. (1/2)
The men and women who crew the fleet of C-17s in Charleston are heading to Ft. Polk tomorrow to participate in readiness exercises with the Army's 509th infantry regiment.

Please join in thanking them for their service and praying for their safety and success in their mission. (2/2)
President Trump is keeping his promise to secure our border, and South Carolina is proud to help. The great men and women of our Army National Guard are answering the call to serve in Texas in support of Operation Guardian Support. (1/)
After years of fighting for reform, the people of South Carolina will finally have the opportunity to vote to bring greater efficiency and accountability to our education delivery system by making the South Carolina Department of Education a cabinet agency.

By removing the U.S. from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, President Trump is further solidifying our role on the world stage. He promised to undo this Obama-era deal with a leading state sponsor of terrorism, and today marks another promise fulfilled to the American people.

I am proud of the work Team South Carolina has done to be ranked one of the nation's best states for business. We must cut taxes &amp; red tape to continue attracting the best companies. That's what I'm working to do as your governor &amp; I need your help: https://t.co/PzKfbhaSoq https://t.co/bk72xGF5tY
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy; it’s great that @POTUS and his administration know that and support them. I enjoyed visiting Forest Lake Fabric with @SBALinda to see the success they’ve had after the 2015 flood thanks to much hard work and an SBA disaster loan. https://t.co/DdgLngzjrF
I look forward to joining the Greenville Co. GOP Bronze Elephant Dinner &amp; Candidate Forum tonight at 7pm. Friends in the Upstate, tune in to @945theanswer to listen live as I share my plan to cut taxes, grow our economy, &amp; fight to preserve conservative values in South Carolina.

...and in the strongest possible terms, I urge the Senate to do the right thing and make sure no South Carolinian pays another dime for power plants they will never get. (3/3)
...and today, the House took a vote that shows the people of this great state that they will join me in continuing to fight for them. Doing the right thing on behalf of the people we have been elected to serve should always take priority over the concerns of any company...(2/)
The House of Representatives and I have remained steadfast in our belief that there is no acceptable amount for South Carolinians to continue paying into the failed nuclear reactors at VC Summer... (1/) https://t.co/ysf3pyybpu

Planned Parenthood can celebrate all they want - but as long as I’m Governor abortion clinics will not receive one penny of taxpayer money to victimize the unborn.  Every life, born and unborn, is sacred and will be protected in South Carolina. https://t.co/r0LhS6xFnY
Thank you SC House! Voted today to affirm that sanctuary cities have no place in South Carolina.
It's women like Mrs. Bush that make our nation strong, and her presence will be missed. (2/2)

This morning in Dillon we opened our state's second inland port. There's a new kind of prosperity coming to South Carolina, and it hasn't been by accident. Thank you to everyone who together worked hard to make this dream a reality. https://t.co/kJMYAaGgCC
Please join Peggy &amp; me in praying for the safety of our armed forces, as well as our allies in the UK &amp; France. President Trump's decisive action &amp; leadership on the world stage sends a clear message that the U.S. won't stand for the atrocities committed against innocent Syrians.
While we were blessed with a year without losing any firefighters, it is still important to remember those who have given their lives in the past at the Firefighters Line of Duty Death Memorial Service at @SCStateFire and thank those who serve and protect us every day. https://t.co/ldrZK812sd
The S.C. Senate just took a major step towards making sure there will NEVER be a sanctuary city in our great state. Huge thanks to Sen. William Timmons and the rest of the Senate for sending a loud and clear message to the world that criminals won’t find sanctuary here.
There are more important priorities the SC Senate budget should address- like funding certified law enforcement (resource) officers for schools in districts that can’t afford them.
Not on my watch. #VETO https://t.co/vPhJuYSatx
President Trump is right, the best way out of poverty is a job. Welfare assistance should be seen as a temporary measure and should include incentives to find gainful employment—that’s exactly what we’re doing in South Carolina.    https://t.co/KouBJCjb4v
Low taxes &amp; less regulation mean more jobs for hardworking South Carolinians, and I’m proud of our success in attracting businesses to invest in our state.

This legislation will allow the future of Santee Cooper to be objectively determined through a transparent and accountable process that places the interests of taxpayers and ratepayers first. (4/)
Speaker Lucas and the House of Representatives have shown tremendous leadership with their efforts to protect the ratepayers of our state. (3/)
As I have stated before — the only feasible solution to protect ratepayers from shouldering this debt is the sale of Santee Cooper. (2/)
Santee Cooper is saddled with $8B dollars in debt-$4.3B of it comes from the failed VC Summer project. The leadership of this rogue agency has demonstrated on numerous occasions that their interest lies in protecting their own jobs rather than protecting their own ratepayers.(1/)
He is risen! Peggy and I hope that all South Carolinians have a blessed Easter with their loved ones.
I hope everyone has an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifice Christ made for us this #GoodFriday.    May His suffering fill our hearts with humility and gratitude for His many blessings in our lives.

@petermccoyforsc Thank you Rep @petermccoyforsc for your determined leadership chairing SC House ratepayer committee - delivering critical taxpayer friendly relief to solve VC Summer crisis.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Send me a bill that ensures South Carolina ratepayers will not pay a single additional dollar towards the failed V.C. Summer reactors and I’ll sign it.  Send me a bill that continues to charge ratepayers and I will veto it. https://t.co/ZqWwq77HJ0

I applaud the President’s leadership, am grateful for the hard work of the men and women on South Carolina’s response team, and look forward to working together to end this scourge on society. (3/3)
That’s why in S.C. I issued an executive order declaring it a statewide public health emergency and creating the Opioid Emergency Response Team. (2/)
Today President Trump announced additional measures to combat the opioid crisis—the crisis next door. The opioid crisis is a silent killer affecting people all across our society. (1/)
We don't need anymore legislative study committees, debates, or deliberation, we know what we need to do and we need action now. Today was proof positive. (3/3)
We owe a debt of gratitude to all involved who acted so quickly and decisively.  For months, I have called on the General Assembly to join me in placing a trained, certified police officer in every school, in every county, all day, every day. (2/)
Potential tragedy was avoided at AC Flora High School. In two separate incidents, students and educators reacted quickly to reports of suspicious activity and behavior to their Richland County Sheriff's Department school resource officer. (1/)

It's an important step that will protect the foster licenses of @MiracleHill and other faith-based foster care organizations so they can continue to provide safe and supportive environments for our young people in foster care.

I am hopeful the House will make a similar commitment to school safety in their budget before leaving town this week. (2/2)
For months i have called for a uniformed law enforcement officer stationed in every South Carolina school all day, every day. My Executive Budget invested in a grant program to start placing officers in schools that need them.  (1/2)

You may encounter blocked roadways and detours as you return home.
We urge patience as you return home and ask that you adhere to specific instructions from your local law enforcement agencies.
Restricted access to Harbour, Hunting &amp; Fripp Islands along with Edisto Beach will be allowed by local LEOs as conditions permit.
Hilton Head, Daufuskie, Tulifinny, and Knowles Islands have already been opened for re-entry.
At 9:15 am this morning, I lifted the evacuation order issued for Hurricane Irma.
*IRMA UPDATE SEPTEMBER 12, 10AM*  THREAD
Coordinating with local officials, I have lifted evacuation orders, effective at 9:15 for all barrier islands. Tune into 10:00 AM briefing.
Locals officials will restrict access to Edisto Beach, Hunting, Fripp and Harbor Islands. HHI, Daufuskie and all of Jasper are open.
Tune in live on @SCETV https://t.co/Js4qGvYRWb https://t.co/YiiB2LPQXd

It's because of the selfless sacrifice of first responders then and now that we know hate and evil will never win in our beautiful country.
South Carolina, as we weather the storm today, let us take a moment to pause and remember those who lost their lives 16 years ago. https://t.co/dGCiW5WjGO
Looters, mischief-makers and thieves will be arrested on sight and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
Let me make this perfectly clear: We have zero tolerance for those who try and take advantage of this storm for personal gain.
State and local law enforcement officers along with armed National Guardsmen continue to patrol the evacuated barrier islands.
This will likely include considerations like road safety, power and water availability among others.
While the storm may have passed, the evacuation cannot be lifted until it is safe for residents to return.
The decision to lift the evacuation order for the barrier islands will be made in close consultation with local officials.
The Electric Cooperatives 250 linesman crews; Duke has 6,000 working across the Carolinas.
At this moment there are linesmen out in the storm working to restore power across the state. SCE&amp;G has 2,582.
Largest outages are in Charleston, Beaufort, Berkeley, Lexington and Richland Counties.
At this hour, there are over 146,784 power outages across the state.
Stay away from downed power lines or trees and limbs with downed power lines.
Do not attempt to drive this afternoon. Rising water can come out of nowhere. There will likely be numerous tornado warnings issued.
There is no need to put yourself, your family or the lives of first responders at risk. Stay inside if you don't need to venture out.
This is a dangerous storm – in the last few hours we've seen the storm surge crash into the coast at high tide. This is a dangerous surge.

This #IndependenceDay let us reflect upon and honor the sacrifices made by those fifty six, and the generations since.

241 years ago fifty six men signed their names to one of the most consequential documents in human history.
Constitution ensures voters ballot choices will always be secret. Americans have died protecting this freedom (3/3) 🇺🇸🇺🇸

@TVAmy we're blessed w/ unmatched natural resources & tourism industry that drives our economy.we dont have to sacrifice one for the other
@TVAmy  Reading skills are critical. Check out our "Path to Prosperity" at www.HenryMcMaster.com
@TVAmy Sure do, we used video, twitter, new media all this week.  Check out www.HenryMcMaster.com
@TVAmy Not really.  The concerns of hard working South Carolinians are more important to me.
@TVAmy we need a governor who is focused on job creation with an economic strategy for SC's future. That's what I will be.
@TVAmy simple. craigslist knowingly posted ads for prostitution, which is illegal in SC. we told them to stop.
@TVAmy the courts would likely have a very high threshold for proving incapacitation.  which is where such an action would likely end up.
@TVAmy top priority is ensuring the governor works closely with business leaders on job recruitment and expansion.
@TVAmy keyword in the provision is whether the governor is incapacitated. I don't believe we are dealing with such a situation.
@TVAmy thank you for inviting me to this forum.
We have what we need to compete globally. What we need now is leadership. That's why I'm running for governor. #sctweets
