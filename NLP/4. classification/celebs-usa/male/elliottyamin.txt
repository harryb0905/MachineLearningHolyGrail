@jpconnelly &amp; u knw what else.. @ErikaBolton knew all along that @RonDeShay wsnt gonna pay us &amp; didn't have the decency 2 tell us
@jpconnelly dude,I don't know/care where he lives..I just knw everything's in his wife's name,so he can carry on w/his fraudulent ways
@jpconnelly he leases that house....and his bullshit company https://t.co/EmHGWxtj1a where he steals from families is in his wife's name

This is my livelihood...what if your boss just stopped paying u without any explanation,&amp; stopped talking/responding 2 u?..&amp; I just didn't
antage of you...I just can't allow this to continue without putting Ron Deshay on blast!
unfortunately this happens far 2often in the music industry...learn,know,understand your biz,for there will ALWAYS b some1 lookin 2 take adv
He should not be allowed to conduct ANY sort of business moving forward #RonDeshayMustPay
Don't let #RonDeshay lie,cheat,or steal from you ...I only assert 2 prevent this happening 2 YOU in the future.. https://t.co/3UMhIWXlYo
Ron Deshay refuses to make this right..doesn't have the decency 2 reach out 2 us..his company https://t.co/EmHGWxKUpK is in his wife's name
his wife Colette Deshay are hiding from EVERYbody...we SIGNED CONTRACTS,and they meant nothing...this move was calculated &amp; premeditated
...he &amp; his wife paid ONLY a few performers for the OCCE xmas event on 12/23,&amp; left the rest of us high n dry...the checks bounced,now he &amp;

This piece of stools name is Ron Deshay/used 2b a producer @AmericanIdol .he owes me &amp; at least 10 others thousands https://t.co/DqSLHjCbUC
There are at least 20 people who are each owed thousands of dollars..thousands..Ron Deshay is a piece of stool  https://t.co/TDU6tz65FR
I've tried patience,benefit of the doub &amp; professionalism..but all that gets thrown out the window when ur dealin w/a coward like Ron Deshay
