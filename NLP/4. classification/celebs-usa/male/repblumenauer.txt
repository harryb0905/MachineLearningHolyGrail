Everyone should have access to health care, no matter what.   I'm proud to be leading the effort for universal care with @RepJayapal and over 100 of our colleagues. The time is now. #MedicareForAll https://t.co/fPwumI5kQ4
One-third of food produced in North America depends on pollination by bees and they alone account for $15 billion of the economy.   In order to maintain a healthy food supply, bee-toxic insecticides have no place on our farms. I'm working with @RepMcGovern to #ProtectPollinators https://t.co/ebV1TKoEMX
Well said @chefjoseandres! #Oscars
Gov’t should not interfere with decisions made between women, their families, and medical care providers. This gag order is a direct attack on 24,000 Oregonians who can’t afford the rising costs of health care and rely on providers like @PPFA. #NoGagRule
My bill with @RepMcGovern fixes this loophole. We need experts in charge of protecting the future of our pollinators, not insiders from the industries they are supposed to regulate. #ProtectPollinators https://t.co/kwauLVbE9v
When @realDonaldTrump's border wall rhetoric meets the reality of his budget and enforcement priorities, guess who loses... the fight against human trafficking.  Once again, Trump talks big and short changes important priorities.  https://t.co/6D1txqjigu
One in three bites you eat every day come from pollinators. Their decline is a dire threat to our food safety and security. We MUST act to #ProtectPollinators and #ProtectOurFood. https://t.co/ZvhFrFs7zf
This unsurprising news makes it even more clear that Trump is increasingly acting alone.  And that he’ll stop at nothing to undermine his own agencies.  Must be awfully lonely out there on your island of denial, Trump.  https://t.co/H2oRa8y96e

This morning, @BlueStarDonuts, Sen. @RonWyden, and I celebrated the legalization of hemp by unveiling the new hemp-based CBD donut!  It’s a delicious win for our country, highlighting only one of the many versatile ways that hemp can now be used. https://t.co/qFQPeWLpky
If Trump can call a national emergency for a fake crisis at the border, then surely Congress should call a national emergency for the very REAL crisis that is climate change.   That's why I'm introducing a resolution to declare a national emergency on the climate crisis.
@AxelRugger I am...https://t.co/TsKE5REuCZ
I don't think emergencies are optional. They also aren't normally followed by a weekend getaway to a Florida golf resort.  That's not how it works.   This is just a wildly unrealistic attempt at fulfilling an unpopular campaign slogan. #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/AjGGWmrm43

Today, I will observe a moment of silence at 2:22 PM to remember the victims.  We must never forget the 17 lives lost that day and honor them with action to end the nationwide epidemic of gun violence. #NeverForget #NeverAgain
One year ago, a senseless act of gun violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS shook the community of Parkland, FL &amp; the entire country.  Gun violence in this country is far too common. We are making sure this Congress is the one to finally address it. #MSDStrong

Oregonians &amp; nearly every American will need to take time off to care for a loved one.   Major life events like having a child or dealing w/ an illness should never plunge a family into poverty, which is why I'm supporting the #FAMILYAct for an inclusive national #paidleave plan.
Confusion and complexity with smaller refunds and higher taxes for many.  All so we can explode the deficit to give billions in tax breaks to some of the largest, most profitable corporations &amp; wealthiest Americans.  No wonder people call it a #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/FXoSjJdg5T
As our trade subcommittee starts to examine NAFTA 2.0, it is important to evaluate its environmental provisions in light of what happened, or more accurately, what didn’t happen in the enforcement of NAFTA 1.0 protecting the environment along the border. https://t.co/YqRMzySuvS
The #GreenNewDeal calls for us to step into the 21st century and create a sustainable future.   High speed rail, green infrastructure, and investing in transportation options is how we'll get there. https://t.co/hSEnZvgJsL

The #GreenNewDeal helps us put all the pieces together: saving the planet, protecting the health and security of our families, and guaranteeing a higher quality of life for everyone. These aren’t just aspirations. It’s our mission
Smart people gathering to share best practices and inspiration at @GEI_at_LClark conference. I appreciated an opportunity to discuss the role the #GreenNewDeal will play in overcoming Trump’s assault on climate policy and our future

The Trump admin continues to put industry before the people. We can no longer allow big phrama to decide the fate of your prescription drug prices.   We must allow Medicare to negotiate on behalf of patients and combat the skyrocketing cost of Rx drugs. #EndRxMonopolyPrices https://t.co/YURxTVIGkM
Outside @HouseJudiciary today was a crowd of passionate gun violence activists. This is what democracy looks like.   Shockingly, this is the first hearing in the House on gun violence in years. Dems in charge make a difference.   I'm proud to support #HR8 to end this epidemic.
For 8 years, the GOP talked about cutting benefits Americans earned through decades of hard work. Dems are serious about solving the social security crisis &amp; today's @WaysMeansCmte hearing was the first step.   We must fulfill the promise of a retirement with dignity &amp; security.
Many other significant concerns with provisions relating to the environment, labor, and enforcement all need strengthening. Trying to force consideration of this trade deal prematurely is not a recipe for success.
Talking to other members, my strong first impression is that there’s a lot of work needed on access and cost of Rx drugs in NAFTA 2.0 to get committee support and House passage.
Well done @staceyabrams! Wish I could have attended your #SOTU19  #BoycottSOTU #SOTUBoycott #AbramsAddress #AbramsResponse

Roger Stone was arrested by FBI agents who are working without pay.  The irony is too rich.
This isn't even because of the shutdown! I highly doubt that Trump’s admin is 'fixing all of the problems' of climate disruption before they start, as claimed. What an utter sell-out to industry. Yet another reason we need a #GreenNewDeal. #ActonClimate  https://t.co/03F3pUGQVg

Day 34 of the #TrumpShutdown, Dems have passed 10 bills to re-open the government since becoming the House majority.  How many have Senate Republicans passed?  A whopping total of ZERO. #WheresMitch

It’s not a surprise that I'm #1 on this list. I’ve been working on this issue since 1973 when Oregon was the first state to decriminalize possession.   It’s also not a surprise that this group opposes reform &amp; keeps their💰 quiet.   Legalization is coming. Deal with it. https://t.co/PSpv2TiWbR
Ending the prohibition of marijuana isn’t enough! Restorative justice &amp; access to opportunity for communities of color into this thriving industry must be part of the solution.

While some states are doing the right thing, the fed. govt also has a duty to ensure we’re lifting American families out of poverty. That's why my Dem. colleagues &amp; I have intro'd a bill today to increase the federal min. wage to $15/hr by 2024. #ForThePeople #RaisetheWage (2/2)
Nowhere in our country can a person working 40 hrs/week at the current federal min. wage afford a 1- or 2-bedroom apartment w/o public assistance. It's been 10 years since the federal min. wage was last raised.  It's time for Congress to act now. #ForThePeople #RaiseTheWage (1/2)

Meanwhile, 800K fed employees who want to go to work are missing their 1st paycheck today b/c Trump &amp; McConnell refuse to do their jobs.  At what point will Senate R’s say ‘enough is enough’ and pass just one of the many House bills to re-open the gov’t? #TrumpShutdown (2/2)
Day 21 of #TrumpShutdown, liar-in-chief wants to divert $$ from recovery funds for #PuertoRico &amp; other areas to put towards his fantasy “crisis”. Sure 3K Americans died in PR, but it’s nothing compared to the thousands of Trump’s make believe terrorists crossing the border. (1/2)

Don't forget the #TrumpShutdown happened w/ a Republican controlled House, Senate &amp; White House.   The new House voted to open the government last week &amp; will do it again this week.  Trump got the shutdown he wanted. Republicans need to stand up and end this foolish tantrum.

Day 16 of #TrumpShutdown, here's a snapshot of what the new year looks like thanks to Trump's petulance:  🚫 IRS can't issue tax refunds or transcript requests for loans   🚫 Much of the nation's immigration court system is closed, adding to a backlog of over 800K cases

12 days have gone by without hundreds of thousands of workers getting paid.   Trump is tweeting &amp; holding hard-earned paychecks hostage over an unpopular wall while families are suffering.   Dems are ready to take action right now to lead our country out of this mess.

The #FirstStepAct has that name for a reason, as it's merely the first step toward long overdue reform.   After decades, it's time to finally address the worst aspects of this broken system like mandatory minimums, unreasonable sentences, &amp; programs to reduce recidivism rates.
Happy Holidays from Donald Trump! Today's present is throwing the hungry under the bus.   With 40 million Americans struggling with hunger, we should be making it easier, not harder, to feed those in need. https://t.co/4yZJoV7XlQ
In 20 yrs he could never admit failures or acknowledge that his numbers never added up, despite the cheerleading of WSJ &amp; Fox News. He was complicit in Trump undermining the credibility &amp; integrity of our Democracy.  It is a sad end for a nice guy who just could not deliver.
Passed ZERO laws to prevent senseless gun violence across the country✅  Rolled back Wall Street reform✅  Rolled back critical protections for clean air &amp; water✅  Oh, and don't forget  Refused to stand up to Trump✅  Led his party to the largest defeat in 42 yrs.✅
There is no debate. Ryan's legacy:  Exploded the deficit w/ reckless gov't spending ✅  Made a hash of the tax code w/ GOP tax scam &amp; increased income inequality✅  Pushed Trump's anti-immigrant agenda ignoring the plight of desperate families✅  Assaulted the healthcare system✅ https://t.co/TBPbUPPILA

@portlandmercury I’m making a list and checking it twice...
Healthcare is a right, not privilege. If we do this right, we can lay the foundation not only for dramatic coverage expansion under #ACA, but for a future in which every American can #getcovered, no matter the age, econ. status or pre-existing conditions. #MedicareforAll (3/3)
This is the 2nd major attempt to gut a law for which they have no viable alternative. This is our moment to redouble our efforts to understand and advance proposals related to #MedicareforAll &amp; ensuring all Americans #getcovered, no matter what. #ACA
When @GOP launched their assault on the #ACA soon after assuming control of Congress &amp; WH, I predicted they would accelerate the #SinglePayer movement by 10 yrs. W/ this latest court ruling putting the ACA in more jeopardy, they cut that time frame in half. #MedicareforAll (1/3)
Zinke &amp; this admin’s legacy is one of damaging our public lands for the enrichment of the few &amp; undermining protections for our environment &amp; wild creatures.   Now, will they get someone worse? House D’s will keep the spotlight on these reckless people &amp; fight them at every turn. https://t.co/JXpSZRx2LZ
This is outrageous! The coordinated attack on the Affordable Care Act by the #GOP continues, despite the fact that elections across the country were won on supporting #ACA. We will keep fighting.  See you in another court! #HealthcareforAll https://t.co/IXIa2ruIca
Thank YOU @sunrisemvmt and activists for YOUR passion and leadership for a better, greener future. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/vaHp6HUa0b
It’s been 6 years since the tragic #SandyHook Elementary mass shooting &amp; since then, 1,917 mass shootings have gone by without any common sense solutions. No more. The tide is turning.  #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/OKWorXfmn8
This is horrifying. This admin &amp; their brutal, inhumane tactics have shocked, traumatized, and resulted in the loss of an innocent child’s life.  Democrats will ensure an immediate investigation into how this took place. This behavior by @CBP must end. https://t.co/F5KsO4B8oB

Yep, that’s the plan. https://t.co/MgINZ34qjr
We should  not allow him to shut down the government, or give him money which he promised Mexico would supply that would add to the yawning deficit or short change other vital priorities. Make him deliver. #TrumpWall #TrumpShutDown (4/4)
We should be as unequivocal as Trump. If he knows how to do these things, and if he is the master negotiator and master builder, he will build the wall with Mexican money. #TrumpWall #TrumpShutDown (3/4)
The most unequivocal promise from his campaign as that he would build a wall and that Mexico would pay for it.  We should simply go home and let him deliver on his unequivocal, often repeated campaign promise. (2/4) https://t.co/lh92cezsRX
Put aside the fact that Trump's wall is a stupid idea and will never be built, we should stop pretending you can negotiate with him over the wall. But, as Trump himself pointed out, we don't need to. (1/4)
Seeing this on the anniversary of the #ParisAgreement is troubling. How many more reports are needed to document this urgent crisis?   It’s time for bold action with a #GreenNewDeal #ActOnClimate https://t.co/82yTpTi4vD
These days, bad outcomes that could’ve been worse count as victories. It’s time to change the dynamic.  In the meantime, the crisis in American agriculture, the threats to most farmers and ranchers, the challenges to giving Americans healthy food, must wait for another Farm Bill.
This Farm Bill is a disappointment. It’s a massive waste of tax payer dollars that does little to address climate change or improve nutrition for families. Just because the bill could be worse, that’s no reason to vote for it, so I will oppose.
Trump’s repeated lies about the border wall are not new. Some presidents lie, but he takes it to new lows by constantly peddling outright falsehoods.   When he misleads his supporters, it damages democracy. But when his lies drive our policy, he threatens the world as we know it. https://t.co/4SANJWwUn5
As if separating children at the border wasn’t enough, the Trump Admin is looking to reduce legal immigration by further complicating the process &amp; penalizing people for applying to programs that support their basic needs.   It’s not the Oregon way and I’m fighting back. https://t.co/Qozm7FwLGX

You would think after losing a nat'l election, creating a blue wave &amp; exploding the budget deficit, GOP would have learned that tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; powerful are not popular.   Voters elected Democrats to actually listen to the needs of our families. It's time to start.

Looking forward to voting for @NancyPelosi as speaker when the Democratic Caucus meets.   It’s time for Democrats to unite as she has consistently shown outstanding skill, vision &amp; commitment.
But, the days of GOP control of the House are numbered. When Dems take back control, I will fight to put an end to the GOP putting politics over facts.   When it comes to the environment &amp; protecting endangered species, science—not mindless politics—should rule the day.
Since House R's have been in charge, they've had an abysmal record on animal welfare and their first move after the recess was to remove all gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act. Scaling back protections now is not only wrong, it has no basis in science.
I unequivocally reject white nationalism and recognize it is a threat to individuals, communities, and American democracy itself.   #RejectWhiteNationalism
Great to chat with @momsdemand Founder @shannonrwatts &amp; @everytown President @johnfeinblatt about what this next chapter means for us in our fight for common sense gun reform.   This is a uniquely American epidemic. We MUST end senseless gun violence. https://t.co/eBn8KScFpp
Trump flew all the way to Paris to pay respect to those lost in WWI &amp; skipped because of rain.   Today, he flaked on going to Arlington Cemetery &amp; the White House didn't even attempt to make up an excuse.   Shame.
Thankful for the service of our armed forces this Veterans Day. Our vets must receive the respect and care that they have nobly earned and should be given equal access to medical marijuana if they choose.

Deeply saddening news coming out of Pittsburgh, a city I just visited filled with such energy and optimism. My heart goes out to the victims of the horrific attack, members of the Jewish community, and all those subjected to hate &amp; fear.
Illinois gubernatorial race is the latest example of marijuana legalization being good politics as well as good policy. Legalization is playing a role in swing state elections, adding more support for our federal cannabis reform agenda.   https://t.co/wvM5pwnmnw

On November 6th, please do not forget the GOP has voted, campaigned, &amp; litigated against your healthcare for years.    The reality is, a vote for Democrats is a vote to protect millions of Americans w/ pre-existing conditions and begin moving us toward universal care. https://t.co/mMh5b1I9OS
Honored to be the only Oregon official chosen to participate in this incredible project.

.@OregonGovBrown's DEQ gave Oregonians a chance to weigh in on Trump's environmental rollbacks––something his EPA is too scared and immoral to do.   That's real leadership from Governor Brown when the federal government abdicates its responsibility.
No coincidence OR is #1. @KateBrownForOR pushed for automatic voter registration and supported vote by mail as Sec of State and Gov.  It's past time Congress adopts the Oregon way and passes my legislation w/ @RonWyden to take vote by mail nationwide.  https://t.co/yBK5AMiciO

293 days.  That's how long the GOP delayed to steal Merrick Garland's seat. But apparently, it only takes one day to decide if an alleged sexual assailant is worthy of a lifetime appointment.   The GOP has brought shame &amp; dishonor to the Court. This is why elections matter.
While they attempt to push through their Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault, the GOP refuses to renew of the Violence Against Women Act.   Unacceptable.   Our efforts to combat domestic violence &amp; sexual assault should never be pushed aside. #VAWA
This decision by Senate Republicans shows that listening to Dr. Blasey Ford is only about checking a box. To vote on a lifetime appointment 24 hours after a woman’s testimony of her traumatic sexual assault is disrespectful to survivors everywhere &amp; they should be ashamed. https://t.co/kahw65caPM
Allowing the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund to expire is the clearest indication of the GOP's attack on public lands &amp; special places. It is critical to #SaveLWCF and continue the fight to save public lands.

After shoving through a cruel House Farm Bill &amp; a status quo Senate bill, leaders are now negotiating a final bill. Demand they reform our food &amp; farm policies for ALL Americans, not special interests. I’ve laid the path forward in my #FoodAndFarmAct: https://t.co/cjQEBg25GL
Across the country there are state &amp; local policies to protect our families from toxic pesticides. House GOP wants to undermine these safeguards in the Farm Bill.

Gutsy. Inspired choice. Clearly there was retribution for courage of his convictions. People should be encouraged to express their views, not punished by losing their livelihood.   30 years of "Just Do It"... this encapsulates that message best.   A very Oregon thing to do. https://t.co/QUE9Co6JtJ

There are many reasons Trump's SCOTUS nominee, Kavanaugh, would be a disaster. How many more would we find as GOP jams through his nomination, not even allowing time for review of the 42k documents released hours before today's hearing &amp; withholding 100k more. #WhatAreTheyHiding

Corruption is at the very core of Trump's GOP. It speaks volumes that the first 2 members of Congress to endorse him are now indicted. First Collins, now Hunter. Everyone should read this 47-page indictment. Perhaps most appalling: using veterans as cover. https://t.co/nwjk2en3XY
The culture of corruption &amp; cronyism runs deep in the Trump administration (remember Pruitt, Price, Flynn??), and the GOP in Congress is no better (consider: Rep Collins and Rep Hunter Jr indictments). The best way we can protect our democracy now is at the ballot box.
Guilty is guilty. And the evidence of corruption around Trump cannot be ignored. The Manafort conviction &amp; guilty plea by Cohen make clear that the Special Counsel’s investigation must continue.
While the West burns &amp; the world suffers from climate change, Trump unveils a #DirtyPowerScam letting polluters off the hook &amp; putting future generations at risk. Irresponsible &amp; dangerous.   We must fight back at the ballot box. A better Congress is our best check on Trump. https://t.co/3jgJVDcEh7

Drain the swamp? Between Trump admin &amp; GOP in Congress, the swamp is swampier. If they aren't working at the behest of special interests, they're working to enrich themselves or showing complete incompetence.   Our efforts to elect a better Congress are all the more urgent.
Domestic abusers often seek to manipulate or intimidate survivors by threatening or harming their pets. Congress should pass our PAWS Act to expand protections to survivors’ pets &amp; to support programs that offer shelter &amp; housing assistance to survivors of domestic abuse w/ pets.

It is hard to stay focused, but we must. Everyday we must fight to elect a better Congress that will protect our democracy &amp; hold Trump accountable — all while we continue to resist Trump’s dangerous and cruel policies.
Trump characterizes some of our strongest allies as the enemy. He undermines Theresa May &amp; Angela Merkel, while cozying up to Putin &amp; Kim Jong Un. He continues to whine about “witch hunts” &amp; “fake news,” even as his own DOJ announces 12 more indictments for Russian interference.
Amidst the ongoing cruelty of Trump‘s attacks on immigrant families and forced separation, the continued assaults on our health care as his administration works to destabilize and destroy the ACA — we cannot lose sight of the drama playing out on the international stage.

Non-stop obsessing over Trump's reckless antics will add no value to your life. My challenge to you: go on a “news diet” for 24 to 48 hours. Take a break. Let’s start the week w/ renewed energy &amp; commitment to stop Trump by organizing to help take back control of Congress.

Congratulations to @Deb4CongressNM—an incredible candidate who is on track to become the first Native American woman ever in Congress. Enjoyed campaigning for her in New Mexico, looking forward to doing it again &amp; having her in the next Congress!
8 primary elections today—the largest test of the integrity of our election system before Nov. What we know: states w/ OR's #VoteByMail are more secure &amp; have higher turnout. Congress must act on my legislation to expand OR's program nationwide to ensure election integrity.

Trump &amp; his cronies have made clear: special interests are their priority, not the health of our communities &amp; planet. One year after leaving #ParisAgreement, Trump still can't repeal science. People understand the urgency to #ActOnClimate &amp; are fighting back. We are #StillIn.

One year ago our community was struck by an act of terror. Three brave Oregonians were stabbed for standing up to a white supremacist on a MAX train. Two of these heroes died. Sadly, this tragic attack was not an isolated incident. We've seen countless acts of hate.

Now is the time to stop the King Amendment. Everyone who cares about health, the environment, &amp; the treatment of animals, must be heard NOW—loud &amp; clear.
Cleverly named, but insidiously drafted, the so-called "Right to Farm" state ballot initiative in Oklahoma was similar. It failed by a 60-40 margin (in a Trump state!) b/c farmers, ranchers, consumers &amp; ppl who care about the environment &amp; animal welfare spoke out.
.@Harvard_Law explains just how bad the King Amendment is: https://t.co/AfONyj1QU1
The King Amendment would have devastating consequences. Examples: Overturn state bans on baby food containing BPA. Weaken state laws that prevent animal abusers from running pet businesses.
EVERYONE should be paying attention: the GOP #FarmBill approved by House Ag Committee includes the King Amendment, which made a bad Farm Bill much WORSE. It would overturn state &amp; local protections for consumers, environment, food safety, animal welfare. https://t.co/PLk2QRMwi2

We need to #FixTheFarmBill. More on my #FoodAndFarmAct here: https://t.co/cjQEBg25GL
People want good food that is healthy, local, and sustainable. Congress has an opportunity to catch up and help those who need it most. House GOP #FarmBill misses the mark by far, giving more to those who need it the least and making it harder for those in need to get help.
My #FoodAndFarmAct: expands access to healthy food and brings rural and urban communities together. #FixTheFarmBill
GOP #FarmBill: slashes nutrition assistance for those who need it most.
My #FoodAndFarmAct: invests in farmers markets and other local food programs, and helps beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers get priority. #FixTheFarmBill
Farmers markets are a great way to meet local farmers, learn more about where your food is coming from &amp; of course, get healthy foods.   GOP #FarmBill: cuts programs that help promote farmers markets and local food.
My #FoodAndFarmAct: expands permanent funding for programs that help beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers get their feet off the ground and connects retiring farmers with the next generation. #FixTheFarmBill
GOP #FarmBill: does little to invest in beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers.
My #FoodAndFarmAct: doubles investments in conservation and reforms these programs to actually focus on the best practices that improve the environment, while ensuring that smaller farmers, NOT industrial Ag, get funding. #FixTheFarmBill
GOP #FarmBill: cuts conservation funding by $1 billion and gets rid of the Conservation Stewardship Program–one of the largest programs we use to help farmers become more sustainable.
My #FoodAndFarmAct: gets rid of excessive commodity programs, limits payments to rich farmers, &amp; makes crop insurance more accessible to farmers that grow REAL food. #FixTheFarmBill
GOP #FarmBill: doubles down on paying too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places. It’s filled with loopholes that are designed to make it easier for big corporations to get subsidies. 94% of these subsidies go to only six “commodity” crops.
Flying under the radar on Capitol Hill: the House Ag Committee is considering the #FarmBill – a massive piece of legislation that dictates everything from the price of a gallon of milk to the availability of healthy food for those in need.   The House GOP #FarmBill is a disgrace:
#TaxDay is an unfortunate reminder of GOP's misplaced priorities: special interests &amp; big corporations over hardworking American families. And after they’ve made a hash out of the tax code, we will have trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. YOU deserve better.
Who is paying the price for #GOPTaxScam? YOU. Medicare, Social Security &amp; Medicaid are now on Paul Ryan's chopping block. #TaxDay
To no one's surprise: massive tax cuts DO NOT pay for themselves. GOP is putting more $$ in the pockets of those who need it least, while the deficit is exploding (the last 2 months have each set record deficit highs). The #GOPTaxScam adds $1.9 trillion &amp; counting. #TaxDay
In the aftermath of #GOPTaxScam, we're witnessing how bad it really is: massive tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans &amp; biggest companies at the expense of American families. #TaxDay

I have a better idea that would #FixTheFarmBill: https://t.co/cjQEBg25GL
House GOP released their version of #FarmBill today. To no one's surprise, their plan is MORE subsidies for industrial ag, w/ little support for family farms, environment &amp; people who eat, &amp; assistance slashed for those who need it most.
Given the daily allegations of wrongdoing about the White House and Trump campaign, Congress must act to #ProtectMueller and NOW. https://t.co/FeSgWNW5Oy
Now that Republicans are in charge, they've produced trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. They can't be serious about a balanced budget amendment without a plan to balance the budget. They don't have one. This is just a cynical political ploy.
House GOP's "balanced budget amendment" would mean slashing Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid &amp; other programs WE care about deeply to pay for THEIR massive tax breaks for the richest Americans &amp; largest companies. https://t.co/sZmQL6lbVZ
Corruption and cronyism at its worst. Pruitt has to go. #BootPruitt https://t.co/cJcFdLNEkM

We can and should do better. It's on all of us to close the gender pay gap: lawmakers, employers, &amp; workers alike. #EqualPayDay
What Trump fails to understand is that this devastating situation has no simple, military solution. It requires a thoughtful, long-term strategy. There's absolutely no evidence that he can do it.
Obama drew criticism on Syria by declaring a redline, then being unable to enforce it, having no consensus from Congress or support from US allies. While the conflict is complex, we can't allow these atrocities to persist &amp; we must work w/ our allies to end this war.
Trump is completely incoherent on Syria. He's signaled his intention to withdraw troops, which may well have emboldened Assad &amp; now he's threatening military strikes. Meanwhile, he continues to alienate our allies &amp; all of this is clouded by his love/hate relationship w/ Putin.
Trump’s attacks on our democracy are disgraceful.   If there was ever a time to put country over party, it’s now. Congress must act to #ProtectMueller. https://t.co/PRFybVrWQX

The infrastructure crisis in America demands real solutions, but Trump's 'plan' doesn't cut it. Rather than adding to the burden on already cash-strapped cities &amp; states, the federal government must step up.  https://t.co/jvrueYfgc7
Trump refused to release the Democratic memo because of “sensitive“ information. Any guesses? I suspect sensitive shows the Republicans misleading or Trump being further implicated.
While it’s encouraging that there is a little more stability for the fiscal situation, and there is some needed investment for neglected priorities. Overall, the budget proposal falls far short of the mark, and was not worthy of my support.
One can only hope that the intense attention will finally convince GOP leadership to allow the House to fully &amp; fairly consider &amp; vote on legislation to #ProtectDREAMers.
Congress failed again to protect hundreds of thousands of young Americans facing immediate deportation to countries they don’t know. The #DREAMers, &amp; the vast majority of Americans who support them, deserve immediate resolution.
It sentences us and our children to trillion dollar deficits for years to come. It is a missed opportunity to show some fiscal restraint and repair a broken process.
The budget proposal was not worthy of support. Apart from troubling special interest provisions—from unnecessary and unwise spending on nuclear weapons to enhancing agricultural subsidies for cotton—it continues the explosion of our national debt.
The farce continues. Senate Republicans forcing a shutdown.

For GOP to claim #NunesMemo has nothing to do w/ undermining the Russia investigation is an appalling lie. Look at Trump’s tweets. Proving once again that the only winner in the 2016 presidential election was Russia.

Since I won't be attending the #SOTU, I'll be sending an Oregon DREAMer in my place to remind Trump that these are real people with families and jobs, who are vital to our communities. They deserve certainty and protection.
GOP may think it's satisfying its base by blaming Dems for #TrumpShutdown, but they are losing the battle w/ the public who knows better. Even their former RNC Chair agrees this is the result of GOP incompetence. We Democrats must stand firm &amp; make clear what’s at stake.

Republicans should use their complete control of power and govern. If they want our help, they have to work with us—and not hold the American people hostage.
Republicans knew for months that the critical &amp; popular Children’s Health Insurance Program was going to expire last fall. If they would allow a vote on its reauthorization, it would pass and save the government $6 billion over the next 10 years.
Dreamers are in limbo because Donald Trump unilaterally decided to end the DACA program. If Republicans had the courage to allow a vote on our bipartisan legislation to fix the issue, it would pass overwhelmingly.
Today is the first anniversary of complete Republican control of our government. The #TrumpShutdown is theirs.
This #TrumpShutdown is insanity. Republicans have no excuses. Democrats are eager &amp; ready to work w/ Republicans—but they have to work with us. The priorities Dems are fighting for are bipartisan. The American public deserves better. I hope we can give them what they deserve.
The sad drama continues. Awaiting Senate reaction on funding government one week at a time.  Simple solution: Take care of #DREAMers &amp; #CHIP. Everything else falls into place.

#GOPTaxScam is immoral.   Our mission in 2018: #ReplaceAndRepeal.
#GOPTaxBill fails the American people, fails to invest in our communities, fails to deal w/ the challenges we face.
#GOPTaxBill is NOT about helping the middle class. It provides permanent &amp; massive tax breaks for wealthy, w/ top 1% getting 83% of the benefits! The rest of America pays the price. 86 million Americans face a tax INCREASE!
I voted NO on #GOPTaxBill—the largest transfer of wealth in our nation's history, paid for by mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future.

Also concerning, @AjitPaiFCC decided to move forward w/ today’s vote despite reports of hundreds of thousands of fraudulent comments from Russian bots. Rather than cooperate with investigators &amp; take a step back, Pai forged ahead.
My constituents are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly want #NetNeutrality protections to continue. And this isn’t partisan—3 out of 4 Republican voters do too!
In the last week, my office phones have been ringing off the hook &amp; letters have poured in from Oregonians rightfully outraged that @FCC is giving corporations the power to dictate when &amp; how fast they can access their favorite websites and video streams.

#GOPTaxPlan would sharply limit the state &amp; local tax deduction, taxing a tax and making it harder for communities to make up for lost federal support for local programs like education, transportation, environmental protection, &amp; low-income housing.
America is falling apart and falling behind. #GOPTaxPlan fails utterly to invest in America. Actively undermines our communities by taking away tools to build roads, bridges, utilities, airports.
#GOPTaxPlan is a stealth tax on most Americans: In 2025, 22.5M families w/ incomes less than $200k face tax increases. In 2027, 37.8M families w/ incomes below $200k face tax increases. https://t.co/gHA2i3X1BM
Buried in the disastrous #GOPTaxPlan is a provision to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. An incalculable cost to our heritage traded for pennies to Big Oil. Why risk this treasure when we are already awash in oil??
Most egregious giveaway in #GOPTaxPlan for the ultra-rich is elimination of the inheritance tax. Gives fewer than 3,000 families each year an extra tax break worth $151 billion.
GOP claims tax relief for small biz, but cuts for "pass-through" businesses mostly helps wealthy corporations &amp; individuals--like Trump Organization. 70% of pass-through income goes to top 1%. #GOPTaxPlan
#GOPTaxPlan is gift to the wealthiest. Preserves the carried interest loophole – letting hedge fund managers keep billions untaxed, with even Trump saying they’re “getting away w/ murder.”
#GOPTaxPlan makes our children &amp; grandchildren pay for massive tax breaks for the richest Americans &amp; corporations by saddling them w/ $1.7T in new debt.
In the first year alone, #GOPTaxPlan triggers $25B cut to Medicare—cuts that will only get worse over time.
Grad students won’t be able to afford to stay in school w/ #GOPTaxPlan. It taxes their tuition waivers, increasing their tax burden by 400%. This destroys US innovation.
College will be less affordable b/c of the #GOPTaxPlan. 12 million people will lose the ability to deduct their student loan interest from their taxes.
13 million Americans will lose their health coverage b/c of #GOPTaxPlan &amp; premiums will go up by 10%!
#GOPTaxPlan will impose an Alzheimer’s tax of $90 billion on 9 million middle class families by denying tax relief for extraordinary medical expenses.
The $$ corporations get from massive tax cuts in #GOPTaxPlan will reward their CEOs and stockholders. They will NOT invest in workers, research and development, or plant expansion. https://t.co/3VsZ3daGsZ
Backwards priorities: The #GOPTaxPlan gives PERMANENT benefits to those who need it the least—the top 1% and massive corporations. The middle class will see TEMPORARY benefits &amp; many will end up paying MORE in taxes.
Why is the #GOPTaxPlan overwhelmingly unpopular? It's a massive giveaway to the richest corporations &amp; Americans &amp; leaves working and middle-income families behind.

I’ve heard from countless vets that medical marijuana is critical to giving them relief they need. In states like OR where mmj is legal, it’s outrageous that Congress prevents VA from working w/ vets who could benefit.
We all have a part to play to prevent veteran suicide. Whether it’s volunteering for the prevention hotline or Congress prioritizing the needs of our veterans, rather than cutting critical programs to reduce taxes for people like Donald Trump.
There is an epidemic of veteran suicide in America. It's a tragedy that we lose one veteran almost every hour of the day. The numbers are even worse here in in West.

When it comes to the next Farm Bill, we can &amp; should do better for ALL farmers.
Let’s do more to help beginning &amp; underserved farmers by connecting retiring farmers w/ new &amp; making land &amp; equipment more affordable.
We need to make sure ALL farmers who grow ALL types of foods (not just commodity crops) can get crop insurance.
Let’s help small farms that grow REAL foods by limiting commodity subsidies &amp; dedicating more resources to local growers, not large agribiz.
We need food &amp; farm policies that support ALL farmers, not just a select few. #NationalFarmersDay

What's taking place is wrong. We must all continue to raise our voices &amp; fight for transparency, courage &amp; to #ProtectOurCare.
There have been zero public hearings &amp; a refusal to listen to input from patients, providers, hospitals, or even other Senators. Outrageous.
Right now, GOP Senators are working in secret on a bill that will affect the health care of just about every American. Yes…that means YOU.
As we wait for mail ballots, it's still remarkable that we were competitive in deep red #GA06. Republican majority is at risk in 2018!

Even in the minority, we will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act each step of the way.
What is happening now is callous, cruel &amp; irresponsible. Even Trump said it was "mean."
For 7 yrs we have stood ready to work w/ GOP to refine &amp; improve ACA to make it work better. For 7 yrs GOP has done nothing but sabotage it.
Why? Because people's lives are at stake. Health care is too important not to go through the appropriate &amp; transparent legislative process.
When Dems worked on ACA, we spent hundreds of hours in hearings &amp; markups, heard from nearly 200 witnesses &amp; held thousands of town halls.
Because even Trump has acknowledged that health care is "complicated." We need hearings w/ input from the public, providers, hospitals, etc.
Senate Rs are now doing the same, drafting a bill in secret behind closed doors. Textbook case of process designed to fail American people.
House Republicans rushed to get to the floor a bill that will take away health care from 23 million Americans. No hearings, no CBO score.

If his concern for the Syrian people is real, he should start by:

Thought I was done for day but Trump keeps lying. @nytimes calls him out for lying about popular vote: https://t.co/7J5EhQohk0 #LiarInChief
@Bach_Humbug Good point. #36!
Abraham Lincoln: “No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar.” (35/35)
Aesop: “A liar will not be believed even when he speaks the truth.” (34/35)
Maya Angelou: “Let me tell so much truth, I want to tell the truth in my work. The truth will lead me to all.” (33/35)
FDR: Confidence thrives only on honesty, on honor, on sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance (32/35)
Michael Jackson: “Lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons.” (31/35)
Adrienne Rich: “Lying is done with words, and also with silence.” (30/35)
Khaled Hosseini: “When you tell a lie, you steal someone’s right to the truth.” (29/35)
Albert Einstein: “Anyone who doesn’t take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.” (28/35)
Virginia Woolf: “If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people.” (27/35)
Thomas Jefferson: “Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.” (26/35)
Martin Luther King, Jr.: “No lie can live forever.” (25/35)
George Washington: “It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.” (24/35)
Here are some words of wisdom for @POTUS @realdonaldtrump aka #LiarInChief… (23/35)
Refresher for you @POTUS… from @merriamwebster: “A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality.” (22/35)
Lack of regard for facts and truth is a serious character flaw &amp; we cannot have a #LiarInChief as president. (21/35)
These LIES are just from ONE day. POLITIFACT has found only 4% of @realdonaldtrump’s statements to be true. https://t.co/R54Z99hDoE (20/35)
… @presssec also lied about metro numbers, usage of floor coverings on mall, as well as fencing and magnetometers… (19/35)
TRUTH: No claims to back this statement up. Period. (18/35)
.@presssec claims “largest audience to ever witness an inauguration. Period.” FALSE. (17/35)
TRUTH: Aerial shots show otherwise. Period. (16/35)
.@POTUS aka #LiarInChief says 1.5M attended his inauguration &amp; crowds went all the way back to the Washington Monument. (15/35)
TRUTH: Cameras showed it began raining right when he started speaking. (14/35)
.@POTUS aka #LiarInChief says it stopped raining when he started speaking. FALSE. (13/35)
TRUTH: @POTUS has criticized the intelligence community time &amp; time again, most recently w/ tweet... #LiarInChief (12/35)
.@POTUS aka #LiarInChief says media caused feud between @POTUS and intelligence community. FALSE. (11/35)
.@nytimes counters @POTUS &amp; @WhiteHouse #alternativefacts w/ ACTUAL facts https://t.co/DFh194I4d5.... (10/35)
.@POTUS aka #LiarInChief, we will never normalize #alternativefacts or lies. We will hold you accountable. (9/35)
This is NOT normal &amp; all of us especially media need to continue to call these #alternativefacts what they are… LIES! #LiarInChief (8/35)
To call @presssec lies #alternativefacts further appalling. As @chucktodd said "alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods." (7/35)
Both appalling &amp; ironic is @POTUS made false claims at CIA in front of "&amp; ye shall know the truth &amp; the truth shall make you free.” (6/35)
.@POTUS says going to be an admin of "action" to help “forgotten” Americans. How does focusing on &amp; lying about crowd size help?? (5/35)
In speech @POTUS said “From this moment on it's going to be America First.” How do these LIES put anyone but @realdonaldtrump first? (4/35)
To make demonstrably false claims about something as superficial as scale of inauguration crowd is disgraceful. #LiarInChief (3/35)
Clearly, @POTUS @realdonaldtrump has problem with the truth. In fact, he lies. #LiarInChief (2/35)
In first 24 hrs @POTUS makes clear ego, not #facts or #honesty, will be guiding principle for him &amp; his administration. #LiarInChief (1/35)

Nonpartisan CBO gives facts on repealing #ACA—shows it's TERRIBLE IDEA! GOP plan to #RepealAndRun is reckless, punishing 18M just to start.

Today in Portland thousands gathered to #SaveHealthCare. We will NEVER give up fighting for a health care system that works for EVERYONE. https://t.co/BiCeNGZrDS
In our America, no one should EVER be denied access to health care because of their income, age, gender, or pre-existing conditions.
On the eve of what should be a proud moment for Donald Trump, he somehow achieved a new low, which for him is saying something.
Meanwhile as a young man, Donald Trump was dodging the Vietnam War &amp; getting millions from daddy.
All talk? No action? No results? As a young man @repjohnlewis emerged as a civil rights leader—beaten, jailed, risking his life for freedom.
We will fight &amp; reject ANY effort to gut #ACA to protect the most important health care reform in the last 50 years.
#ACA repeal will have devastating consequences including taking health care away from millions of Americans! #MakeAmericaSickAgain
GOP steadfast in plans to #MakeAmericaSickAgain, unsettle healthcare markets, while giving people no plan for what comes next. #RepealAndRun

Will Donald Trump show up to the next debate? If I were him I'd quit while I was behind
Time for America to take a shower....
"Not nice to use Donald's own words against him"
Don't let up on this point..... "she doesn't have the look"
This is the debate Clinton wanted. It will be interesting to see if this moves the needle. Sadly, I think most of his supporters won't care.
His Fingers should Not be anywhere near the nuclear button (no matter how stubby they are)
Powerful answer about NATO joining us to fight terrorism by Hillary....and the power of diplomacy restricting Iran's nuclear weapons
Who could ever doubt Sean Hannity  as a validater for Donald Trump
NATO  of course changed their policies because of Donald Trump!
Let's talk about the question you asked Lester....good idea....maybe Lester should do a little more moderating....
Does America need another 17 minutes of this...really getting painful...
"We have been lead by political hacks in our military leadership" making a mess over the last 10years" ...how can he get away with that?
They are not nasty Clinton ads against the Donald unless he takes it personally that she is using his own words ...how unfair!!!!
"Over the last little while I have produced great relationships with the African american community?"
Murder rate is not up in NYC, but the overall crime drop is mirrored in many  cities that did not have stop and frisk policies
The 3rd area of agreement with Hillary by the Donald...maybe he did prepare....
Great statement on criminal justice reform and on gun safety ....no fly, no buy....guns...you bet
There are right and wrong ways to make people safer and Hillary gets the facts out on declining rate of crime over that last 25 years
It is striking but not surprising that the Donald is doubling down on law and order. Reckless comments and loose with the facts.
Turn the sound off for a minute and just look at the split screen....Hillary seems to be winning that contest....the contrast is stark.
I suspect it is Hard to make "taking advantage of the  laws of the country" sound compelling to most voters.
I totally believe that Trump did no formal debate preparation .....
@Toni_Cole https://t.co/PMdQy3CeJz
The tax return answer was a home run for Hillary!!!!
Love the Washington Post Fact checking in real time...hope some people are using it....
When you really try to follow what trump is saying it makes your head hurt....while Hillary is poised, calm and clear....
Lester...you are losing it.....do your job...you don't want to be a big part of the story tomorrow
You can pick up a copy tomorrow  ......
"If we are actually going to look at the facts"....how novel....
You really shouldn't interrupt her, Donald....doesn't work in a moderated debate between the two of them so far Hillary looking better....
He cannot help himself  ...she is already getting under his skin..."a small loan from his father"???
How many jobs has Trump sent to China, with all his products????
A little fact checking here...China is not devaluing their currency......how many more times will Trump say he and Hillary will agree....???
Trump is having trouble with his face....will anyone notice, or will they care?
Can the debate live up to the hype?

These proposals had no Committee action. If we had REAL hearings, GOP would learn from experts these proposals are good for economy &amp; enviro
POTUS's proposed oil barrel fee would create jobs &amp; economic growth &amp; more than pay for itself. Today's House debate missed the point.
GOP claims to support infrastructure. Instead of discussing real solutions for investment, GOP passes pointless resolution.
Carbon tax would simplify tax code, drive investment for renewable energy &amp; provide revenue to help solve other problems. #ActonClimate

#SHAREAct is truly a hateful bill &amp; anti-animal welfare--undercutting protections for polar bears, elephants &amp; other threatened species.
Customs bill signed into law by @POTUS at Oval Office yesterday--important landmark &amp; pleased it includes my Trade Enforcement Trust Fund.
Glad to hear from law enforcement that appalling animal cruelty crimes are being tracked like other violent crimes. https://t.co/2iMC0WqJg4

Curious...not one word about his failure to lead his own country in their peace process with the Palestinians or what he will do differently
still chewing on the statement that Iran and ISIS are equivalent
interesting statement of known problems, waiting for any hint he has a solution that is better than diplomacy...
Iran will always be America's enemy???? not what many Iranians feel or want....or what America has to accept..
Says Iran is dominating 4 capitals...in large measure because of disastrous policy of America going to war with Iraq that Bibi chammpioned.
Netanyahu is as smooth and effective a speaker as when i saw him here in 1999 for his first appearence.

well, the only "walk of shame" was the GOP leadership, leaving the Chamber after losing 52 of their members. Who counts votes over there?
will we see a "walk of shame" as republicans go to the well to change their votes??? Or do they let  it go down?
republican games on the floor with Homeland Security will be a loss, regardless of final vote....how long to keep the voting machine open?

#RCTID @malidragon whenever I look up &amp; get a little hope for Pelosi, Boehner jumps ahead 10 more. Oh well, at I got preseason Timbers tix.
And now it begins!
Press thins out as the speeches begin
Boehner squeaks by. losing almost I 2 dozen votes signals continuing challenge. He can expect to lose about as many moderates in the future.
12 defection and not half way through the roll call, maybe little more fall out than I thought, still not enough to deny him the gavel.
The drama of additional nominations. I will be surprised if Boehner loses more than 14 votes, even after 3 additional names in play.
Lots of New Yorkers in NYC for Cuomo's funeral. Mostly Democrats, so little impact on Speaker vote.
Would this be a better place with friends and family, especially children here everyday? I think so, but tough thing to do to loved ones.
