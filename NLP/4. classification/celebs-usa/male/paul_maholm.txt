#NewDude #MaroonFriday https://t.co/Gc4hShoL1X
Can’t wait to see all the hard work around @HailStateBB and the new stadium tomorrow. Gonna be special to see @CoachRonPolk all the ceremonies #GOAT #themanthemyththelegend
@BretBaier @FullSwingGolf
Conclusion is both sides need to work but teams are trying to take advantage overall. Just my opinion
There are too many teams not trying and just content with a tough season
Just because you gave a shitty contract doesn’t mean that you don’t offer or low ball a player. Also means that a player has to look at offer and be realistic to the offer and decide according. U r only as good as ur offer also.
I get the sides on free agency for mlb but let’s be serious. It’s the week of reporting. Yes all the superstars will get their money and play and most players will find a job.
@DavidPSamson 🤦🏻‍♂️
@zach_duke 🤷🏻‍♂️ autocorrect.
@zach_duke Need!!  Good luck buddy
@RickyMast That’s awesome.
@ROlenek @jakemangum15 Also only time i figured i needed one was when i fouled back to back pitches off my right shin versus Aaron harang. David Ross was catching and was laughing at me. I told him he better not throw the same pitch a 3rd time. Strike 3 looking. Not an idiot
@ROlenek @jakemangum15 Haha. Those didn’t exist when i was in college. I don’t think anyway. Non athlete pitcher speaking.
@jakemangum15 @ROlenek 🤦🏻‍♂️🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
If your league has challenges and replay and let everything under 2 minutes be called in and yet u still can’t correct it for any reason. Might wanna fix the rule.
@GolfweekNichols @TheVacationDR @diamondresorts It would have to be @joshbeckett and @KMillar15 because i could taunt them for not being very good or @dannykanell and yell SEC after every shot.
So sad to read about 2 great guys that i called teammates and loved the game and everyone around it. Luis Valbuena and Jose Castillo were one of a kind people and players. Gone too soon.
@diamondresorts @TheVacationDR @GolfChannel @LPGA @FSOrlando @IOAUSA 🙋‍♂️
@rtheriot7 @LSUfootball @HailStateFB @1045espn @Realrclark25 Nope!!! Gonna watch it from the couch.
@rtheriot7 @LSUfootball @HailStateFB @1045espn @Realrclark25 Haha. Don’t worry i wouldn’t have tried to break a cup with my FB. Either way. #HailState
@rtheriot7 @LSUfootball @HailStateFB @1045espn @Realrclark25 Why didn’t you swing the bat?? Punching Judy to right field wouldn’t break the cup???
Joe west was wrong. That was a homer. Why have replay if u can’t get it right. 🤷🏻‍♂️
@imBenBerry @MattE_Diaz 🤦🏻‍♂️
@MattE_Diaz @imBenBerry This is probably one of the biggest of series.
@markmulder20 🤷🏻‍♂️
@markmulder20 I threw zero post season pitches in my career but when things aren’t going your way they just seem to snowball. Just my observation.
@markmulder20 Didn’t have his greatest stuff obviously but that had to play a part. I was smoke and mirrors so needed every lil thing. I would think those things just creep in and say you have to be perfect.
@markmulder20 If your pitching and your catcher has 2 passed balls, 2 errors and the ump isn’t giving you a few that are actually strikes and the rest of the guys seem a lil unnerved. How u feeling out there?
What a strike zone.
@MattE_Diaz 🤦🏻‍♂️ let’s get robots and put guys on 2nd for extra innings. Why don’t we just do ghost runners so guys don’t get hurt.
Kratz is one of the best. https://t.co/jIj9szpq31
🤔 ⁦@BNightengale⁩ https://t.co/QbTTmn1ozB
@BNightengale ?? Just wondering if i was correct. Rooting for the @Cubs maybe i misremembered.
@BNightengale Looks like braves celebrated on 9/22/13and pirates celebrated on 9/23/13
@BNightengale Braves/pirates 2013??  Can’t remember if back to back but definitely within days
Congrats 🎈🍾🎊🎉 https://t.co/zfZnMYbYhd
@jwfickett If he could only play in Jackson that would be awesome.
Social media 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ gotta love it but looking at so many things makes you wonder.
@MattE_Diaz @Braves Pace yourself. It seems like forever. Haha.
@CJNitkowski 🤦🏻‍♂️
@RealCJ10 Was hoping to see the legend tonight. Congrats on the HOF and the newest addition.
Thank you to the @Braves and @HailState for allowing me to start The Chop for tonight’s game. https://t.co/9mFBrWKChj
@chriscauley Haha. I’ll be there and look forward to it.
@chriscauley @ChickfilA You probably just ordered wrong.
@Dutch_Oven45 Apple jelly
I see everyone is here to watch the umpires again. 🤦🏻‍♂️ get a clue.
@RonSavell @Dodgers @BrianDozier Thanks 🤦🏻‍♂️. Good luck to @BrianDozier
@michsandjr @zach_duke @Twins @Mariners Twitter wasn’t around during his high school years. Or smart phones. 😂
@jaysonst Anytime.
@jaysonst Do you really think players wanna wait that long? Players deal with the time frame given to them. A lot of different opinions. Just mine. Enjoyed but I’m out.
@jaysonst I can guarantee if he wanted to he could though. As any other big time free agent that is setting all other free agent prices. It’s all in perspective
@jaysonst Haha. No and he shouldn’t. But less players means quicker movement. Obviously bigger players wait for market to set it self in baseball. Other sports go quicker because most prices r set.
@jaysonst I agree baseball is agonizing!! I went thru it. I’m just saying it’s tough to compare. What baseball player would you put with lebron as a free agent??
@jaysonst It’s apples and oranges. Not a good comparison at all. Salary cap vs non salary cap. Max contract vs no max!! A lot of differences in the sport you r comparing.
@lemo22 Congrats!! Welcome to the @HailStateBB family.
@kmthomp29 Thank you!!!
@GolicAndWingo @PinehurstResort @wingoz You know that in 4 man scrambles par is your friend usually to make sure to not slow down play. Most make fun of those that turn in over par.
😥
The man, the myth, and now officially the legend. Congrats @CoachRonPolk on #SEC Legend induction.
@Brent_Rooker19 Looks like maybe a Travis mathew with course logo. 🤷🏻‍♂️
@KevinMcAlpin All good. Just staying busy.
@KevinMcAlpin explanation??
One of these is off 🤷🏻‍♂️ still a non no. https://t.co/s1iykRQOa8
Had a play in 9-10 the other night where ball didn’t reach head height that was called infield fly and kid was on run going to catch it. 🤷🏻‍♂️i thought that was a line drive. https://t.co/4bURsK0SUg
Happy for JV. https://t.co/DIWsaeCMS2
@kmthomp29 I look so young. Wow how times have changed. Haha
Congrats chewey!! https://t.co/ZkwEQIquU6
@MLBNetworkRadio @Jim_Duquette #rallyduqies
@colin_dunlap I am drawing a blank but let’s just say numerous.
The whole “free” agency is taking a hit but let’s worry about players saying they would like to play with another guy and make his team better but that’s wrong. We will tell them to stop.
So a certain league is mad at a player for saying they would look good in a certain uni but not concerneced with the fact of a super slow free agency. Player to player talk is worse than.....
@VernonWells10 @JackWinery
@RealCJ10 How dare you give your opinion after being asked. .🤦🏻‍♂️. Seems to me you had it figured out pretty well. Everyone is different but if i was asking for my son i would probably listen. Congrats on HOF. IMHO
Two of the all time greats. I owe a lot to both. Some of the best in the game. https://t.co/kndiDlVtfR
@mattmiller59 @CJNitkowski should this be a strike?? Speed it up.
@mattmiller59 🤦🏻‍♂️
@MLBNetworkRadio I thought that was his pitching name
@CJNitkowski Tried this theory unsuccessfully now I’m at home.
@CJNitkowski 🤷🏻‍♂️ don’t like it. Don’t let anyone on 2nd. Haha. Creativity
@CJNitkowski How about don’t use second sign or 1st sign. Not a tough concept. There are so many to use if pitchers/catchers get on same page. Odd concept get used to 2-3 as a pitcher and just tell catcher when u come in or pregame which u r using. If needed move to one of the others.
The tribute to fleury was one of the coolest videos and reactions by all involed Players, coaches, and fans. Pittsburgh fans showing the love and well deserved.
It was a general question. Happens in more cities than philly. Just wondering? Have a shot, give a high five but those businesses, cars, government property have no reason to destroy.
Why is there a need to destroy while celebrating a championship??
@dweezy_24 Miss u buddy.
@dweezy_24 Typical hitter. Always waiting on u. If ur in the box ur ready. Stop adjusting your gloves.
Why does baseball have to change its rules?? The number of games that go past 11-12 innings is minimal. Speed it up by making players accountable and know scouting reports/limiting mound visits and hitters stepping out. Just a humble opinion.
Starting a runner on 2nd is one of the dumber ideas i have heard. Doesn’t matter the inning. Ask the pitcher after he gives up a broken bat squeaked thru on first pitch how he feels on losing a game. Stop just stop.
@dannykanell https://t.co/Pdm3ctmsJL
@jeff_flagg @PGAShow @HattCountryClub I’ll drop by. Gonna be there all day. Look forward to catching us
Looking forward to @PGAShow this week. Hope to bring back new ideas to make @HattCountryClub better for our members.
@colin_dunlap @OakmontHooks you should feel honored that you made the list. Haha.
Today is the day that an inspiring book #LiveToForgive is out. Congratulations @JasonRomano can’t wait to dive in when mine arrives.
I would have tried also. Never know if u don’t try. Haha. Maybe don’t put yourself in that position tomorrow https://t.co/CNbjxvZQpE
Haha https://t.co/7eMyhzwv8b

Also thank you @Sports_Spectrum @CoachesTimeOut for sharing the vision of spreading the Word to everyone.

To see some really cool stories give @Sports_Spectrum a follow.
Quick trip with lil man to see @dak @dallascowboys play https://t.co/vWUjjaVCFX
Roy was the biggest competitor the hardest worker and the standard the rest of us lived up to as pitchers.
Sad to see the news of roy halladay. One of the greatest and fiercest competitors i was able to compete against. Somewon i looked up #rip
Let’s do this!!! #game7
Congrats!!!! https://t.co/AQyqnYDGtj
Congrats to the @Dodgers heading to the World Series. A great group of guys coaches and staff. Rooting for ya.
The quick trips to talk were a refresher on who was pinch hitting.
Obviously strikeouts matter when needed and moving runners over/in r big. Just overall does it matter how the outs r made.
If a pitcher gets a groundout instead of strikeout or a hitter strikes out instead of popping up unless in obvious situations do fans care?
One of my favorite guys and will definitely tell you like he sees it. https://t.co/JnOS1yBtl8
What an awesome way to go out. Congrats on a great career. Fierce competitor. Teammates reaction says it all about a great guy. https://t.co/J2v0es5W62

If you can donate or volunteer and your heart moves you in either direction than do it. There are many ways to help those in need.
Watching the coverage of harvey is heart breaking and I know it will take a while to recover. Keep all those affected in your prayers.
It kept my mind off the game but always worried for family and friends in the path and the aftermath.
12 years ago today I sat and watched news coverage of Katrina as I prepared to make my debut for the Pirates.
@kmthomp29 Baseball is a great game and I was fortunate enough to play for a while. There are a lot of great guys in the game. Glad I was a small part
@kmthomp29 It was always nice to get my good luck tweet or sign.
@ElliotJohnson9 I didn't see anything when I tore my ACL at first base.
@PeterBurnsESPN He almost made par also. It was awesome to see them finish making sure the 5  wake up wasn't gonna happen to them.
First trip to @SunTrustPark with my little guy to watch @Braves and @Dodgers beautiful park. https://t.co/uwFVmKi3IB
So if your in wrigley and the wind is blowing out and your exit velocity and launch angle don't average a normal homer what happens??
Is there reports on difference in parks compared to exit velocity and launch angles? Numbers r great but homers r homers.same as outs r outs
Awesome watching @TheJudge44 hit the ball further than everyone but best part is @Cody_Bellinger and his  dad like it's in the yard.
Looks good https://t.co/pSifEv9Eqo

@CaseyStern @MLBNetworkRadio How dare you ever give an opinion and name a team.

@tweetparney make sure to tell Sammy happy birthday buddy.
You will never know if u don't try. Disclaimer though. It's an uphill climb. Don't let that discourage u. https://t.co/GFy9L9S7Y3
Ur missing the point. Not everyone gets a participation trophy. If u fall short u fall short. But continue to push yourself. https://t.co/FDu8a2scVH
Correct but I was talking about everyone gets a trophy. Always push everyone to be the best they can. https://t.co/Pd93Sz8COM
@RDierks correct. Was my record great no. Did I push myself yes. But I was one of a select few to have a chance to even have a record.
Push those close to you to be better and the world will be a better place. Don't expect anything to be handed to you.
Push yourself and you would be amazed at the results and opportunities will be endless.
I'm sorry I don't agree with everyone gets a trophy or you tried hard so I'm proud of you. If you don't like it play better work harder
@D_Ross3 congrats on a great career and what an ending. No better way for grandpa to go out.

Can't wait for this weekend in Starkville and cheering on @HailStateFB  should be a great atmosphere. #morecowbell please.
@maholm24 that's why it said #ITFDB and post season. No love for tsun.
What a way to start the day! Nice job @15_DakP #HailState Now it's time for the boys in blue! #ITFDB #postseason http://t.co/x1DivqfvNg

It has been awesome to be around this group of guys and see how far they can go. I'm a big cheerleader now. #2014NLWestChamps
Thank you to every @Dodgers fan that has come out to support us this year. Tonight was awesome. #2014NLWestChamps
@KevinMcAlpin I'm doin good. Just hopping along these days. Thanks.
“@KevinMcAlpin: Tom Glavine Bobblehead Night in Atlanta. #Braves http://t.co/JDDOBRDmLH”can u grab me one.
Hopefully chase is ok also. Like I said never wanna see a guy get hit anywhere close to there.
@r1ckybobby yes I know rule. Thanks. Neither was an actual swing though. Ball hits them then bat goes. U get hit and see what u do.
@Jbarton83 not a special rule. If they had actually swung before getting hit. A lot of guys get hit then bat goes forward. There is a diff.
@idaho_panhandle my point.
@_bshay yes I saw and don't agree with that one either. U get hit in hand bat will probably go forward.
So Giancarlo gets hit in the face and he got called a strike. Can u actually say he swung when he is trying to save his life. Really.
Thoughts to @Giancarlo818 u never wanna see that happen. Hope for the best.

For the record I didn't unfollow @ajcbraves.  Just a misunderstanding.
I said it it was a bad day and is what is it a few different times but everyone can draw there on conclusions.
I only said no it didn't. U saw the play it is what is. I threw the ball down the middle and the pitcher hit in the gap.
Obviously a certain person wants to take a answer and turn it how he wants. I was asked if getting hit had anything to do with pitches later

“@Chippers_Knees: @paul_maholm what if you could wear an iron man mask for protection?”should get to look like a goalie and pitch. Haha.
Great talk now off to the bay for a  big series.
I'm not speaking for everyone but I have gone thru it in one of the worst cases. Unfortunately it happens.
I will never be for a pitcher wearing a helmet. Wouldn't have helped most people. Injuries r part of the game and we understand that.
I understand pitchers wearing a helmet is a topic bc another guy got hit. Trust me it sucks and don't wish it on anyone.
@mrw874 @JBravesBouchard wouldn't have helped.
“@RDE412: @paul_maholm: did you have any PTSD after taking a line drive to the head ?”no
Nice series and now off to the bay. #bravescountry
“@JBravesBouchard: @paul_maholm in light of Happ's and McCarthy's injury, some ppl are talking helmets for pitchers. Your thoughts?”nope

Trying this again. At the Charlotte airport heading to the beach. Looking forward to a week in paradise with the fam.
@PompeiiFC actually it's a lot of people's prob
Was supposed to be on a beach in about 2 hrs. Instead spending night in Charlotte. 2 1/2 hr detour and missed flight by 15. #usairways
Maybe we should wait for the real pilot before we takeoff again. http://t.co/KKaytHhB
“@tom_hart: @paul_maholm you get double skymiles points for that, right?”haha. That might be wishful thinking.
So first flight of the day is gonna have 2 takeoff and landings with a detour thru Columbia, SC. Good thing we had a 3 hr layover.
@Scott_Nabors18 already gone for spring by the time they start.
“@Ford1219: @paul_maholm Are you going to make anymore State football games this year?”ya probably 2 more.
“@bmor518: @paul_maholm @alfa_tomahawk Like former Bucco Ryan Vogelsong?”correct.
“@alfa_tomahawk: @paul_maholm So.... You go for Giants?”rooting for a good friend. Have a few on the giants.
@IAN_STEWART_2sc got ya. Hope she starts feeling better sure it's just some jet lag hopefully. Wyatt misses his girlfriend.
@IAN_STEWART_2sc did u get to watch tonight? It was good. Liked it better when I could keep watching one after another to catch up
@egmowen sorry I started watching during the season it's kind of addictive.
@Brock_Tech watching the season finale then the new season so I can remember everything.
“@TQuirk3: @paul_maholm did you just start watching it tonight or have you seen seasons 1 &amp; 2?? Lol”seen them all.
Well my sci-fi loving BWE has me hooked on walking dead. Bring it on zombies. #thewalkingdead #wherescarl
thanks @egmowen and @cpudawg2k9 for letting us crash your place...be back in 3 weeks to do it again.
Awesome weekend in Starkville. Heading home &amp; mini me is going off on Siri. Wish y'all could hear this conversation. Haha #HailState #6-0
“@SirSteveMiller: @paul_maholm Where is Anthony's?”west point, ms. Awesome food
“@bmeriwether: @paul_maholm Does this place bring back memories?  http://t.co/0wvNSbcQ”always. Great atmosphere and good to be back
Another awesome dinner at Anthony's with bwe, @cpudawg2k9, @egmowen. Also won the golf tourney today with Mungle and Dubose. -14 thank u.
At this point in the game. As long as it doesn't get crazy. Pitch counts don't matter. Adrenaline. He is gonna be down the same amount.
I am sticking with verlander in the 9th. What do u think?
@NickCollins82 sorry but u root for TSUN that's all. J/k thanks for always supporting me. #HailState
“@KyleMack13: @paul_maholm But a one game playoff is the best way to decide the Wild Card. .... Riiiiiight.”no
Looking forward to alumni weekend in starkvegas and the big game vs the vols on sat night. The grille and Anthony's here we come. #godawgs
So every series is going to a game 5. Great baseball and drama all the way around.
@Brock_Tech definately an entertaining hour.
@Brock_Tech believe it.
@Brock_Tech what am I ready for?
@CoreyFineran not belittling anyone actually. Just didn't know Taco Bell had a chef or she finished 2nd on top chef.
Are u really known as a chef at TACO BELL?
Had a great evening with @ashpapelbon58 and the fam. This is the kind of stuff that happens.  Haha. http://t.co/7hLfoWDX
“@CaleWilson10: @paul_maholm Who you got this weekend? Your Bulldogs or my Vols?” #HailState
“@IAN_STEWART_2sc: My view  @ Grand Wailea - Poolside http://t.co/UXUn6teT”keep rubbing it in. Here's my view http://t.co/bqUkG2Vp
Great discussion as always. I am more of the do ur thing and celebrate with the guys in the dugout and have fun.
@FredEOwens not saying I think it was right or wrong just think its funny whose complaining. I have seen way worse for doing something small
“@xLindsay46: @paul_maholm @bmor518 Hitters don't kiss their bat after a home run though.”wouldn't suprise if a hitter has before.
“@bmor518: @paul_maholm  Kissing the ball though? That's showing up the hitter.”standing at homeplate and doing other things is different?
Happy birthday to @KrisMedlen54 and his flat bill.
I am not saying u can't pimp homers trust me have given up plenty worthy of pimping. Just know big outs for a pitcher are like a homer.
So some are getting upset at a pitcher for doing something  after getting big out. What if a hitter stands at plate after big homer???
“@TheBuzzMon: @paul_maholm From a fellow bulldog, thanks Paul. An honor to have you as a Brave!”thanks
“@burnsclint: @paul_maholm You the man.  Glad you're a part of the Braves and Braves country.  #chopchop”thanks
@MF_southern thanks
Thank u to #BravesCountry for supporting and embracing me after the trade. It was an awesome experience and something to build on #GodBless
@IAN_STEWART_2sc none yet we will see. Probably take a few vacations.
@IAN_STEWART_2sc hope u and the fam r doing well. Hope to play together again sometime.
@SBerthiaumeESPN #HailState agree to disagree. Good night. See ya next season. Good thing we had 2 extra umps tonight.
@SBerthiaumeESPN the rule says "immediately" not right before it hits the ground. Unfortunately a judgement call no matter how bad u miss it
Congrats to @RealCJ10 on a #HOF career it was awesome to have the opportunity to take the same field in the same uni.
It was a pleasure to be a part of a great group of guys going down the stretch. Tough one to swallow tonight. Gonna be back better than ever

The answer was reed Johnson. Thanks for playing.
What an awesome weekend honoring @RealCJ10 and an amazing career. Off to the burgh now then back for a playoff run. #choptober.
Gonna copy @Rupper17 and do a mystery Mellon. Name this persons dome. Haha. http://t.co/yO4RImlD
Mike was dealing tonight and prado had another couple 2strike knocks. No biggie. Craig is filthy hitting a hundo. #BravesCountry
@chuckles_13 hope you enjoyed the game and ceremony. We had our bp rained out so went in early.
Congrats to Darwin Barney on a great streak of flawless D. It was awesome to watch and benefit from.

“@Yorkdogg_10: @paul_maholm I just locked you up today to a three year extension on my fantasy baseball team”can u talk to the FO. Haha.
Wanna add that the bullpen is filthy and handing it over to them is fun to watch.
Tonight was fun. Prado is amazing. Thank u for the ovation on the way off. Very humbling. Gotta keep it going. #BravesCountry
@jjl3799dog thanks slacher.
@michael_schlact thank u sir.
@kharv29rcr thank u. See u in the burgh next week.
What a game and what a way to clinch a playoff spot. The celebration was fun and look forward to having a few more. #BravesCountry
I think the one ref looked at the other and said. Hey man this ain't Saturday mornings in the park anymore. #popwarner.
Good night everyone. Gotta big homestand starting tomorrow. #BravesCountry get to watch @KrisMedlen54 do his thang.
Maybe these refs should say naw we're good it's been real and it's been fun but not real fun. Before a player snaps and choke slams one.
So u catch the ball and land on the ground with it against ur chest  that's possession right. #unbelievable.
Maybe they will actually start to think the regular refs are important. How many games can they screw up before people think its important.
These refs might need to look up the difference in int and touchdown. Or the maybe throw the flag for pushing a guy as hard as u can.
@USMwifeTTT always fun to see what they r up to.
@joshcr52 no he moved and rolled over.
The meerkat living the life. Haha. http://t.co/MXjNjrtS
cutest little Meerkats at Atlanta Zoo   #justsaying #blessed #familyday http://t.co/jbcqBtkF

“@DharrisStateFan: @paul_maholm Have you found a church in Atlanta?” went to @passioncity today. Amazing. Feel recharged.
@kharv29rcr there r some things I can do but not that one. I watched him growing up also
@kharv29rcr it's gonna be tough but there is a chance.  Haha.
To make the night even better @BradPaisley http://t.co/oToaGCP2
It's been a fun couple games against the Nats and big series win for the bravos. Freddie went off tonight. Looking forward to tomorrow.
