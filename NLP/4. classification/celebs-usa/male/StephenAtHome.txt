Cool that Trump got to hang out with his VFW buddies today. They must have been thrilled to hear all his war stories about the line outside Studio 54.
TIRED: The emperor has no clothes.  WIRED: The emperor‚Äôs daughter had to shut down her clothing line due to poor sales, and she is complicit in the emperor‚Äôs racist policies.
Trump says Russia is going to attack the midterms to support Democrats. Also the Joker loves Batman, Sauron hates rings, and Hannibal Lecter is trying the vegan thing for a while.
There are tapes! https://t.co/0JhNZN3Tbm
So, prosecutors have 12 audio recordings from Michael Cohen. Still way fewer porn star payoffs than I thought.

Donald Trump tomorrow: ‚ÄúI meant to say I WOULDN‚ÄôT pay a Playboy model to keep quiet about the affair we had while my wife was home with our newborn son.‚Äù
Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but these Michael Cohen tapes coming out during Shark Week can't be a coincidence.
‚ÄúHi, Welcome to the Donald Trump Presidential Library. Are you all over 18 years old?‚Äù
It's hard to imagine you could be this shocked every day by the Trump administration. https://t.co/oitHWHaP0F
Trump was briefed about Putin‚Äôs election meddling two weeks before the election? That‚Äôs surprising, because I‚Äôm guessing he knew way before that.
So, Trump is inviting Putin to the White House in the Fall. Is that the Fall of 2018 or the Fall of Democracy?
I can't believe they‚Äôre just inviting Putin into the White House. At least the Trojans made the Greeks use a horse.
We can expect Putin to be shown the same hospitality in Washington D.C. that Trump was shown when he visited Moscow. So we might want to Scotchguard the Lincoln Bedroom.
A lot of people have been upset since Helsinki where Donald Trump did not put America first. https://t.co/vfhhL1xKxB
Trump has got the GOP wrapped around his little finger. Which is all of them.
It‚Äôs a free country. And apparently Putin took us up on that offer.
After his disastrous summit with Putin, it is starting to dawn on some people: Trump may be a bad president. https://t.co/b3LtcjDZym
Of course Obama gave a great speech. He‚Äôs married to Melania‚Äôs speechwriter.

Sure, Trump wants to kick people out of America without due process. But look on the bright side: without due process, it's not really America anymore!
Harley Davidson is going to move production to Europe to avoid tariffs. Comment dit-on "midlife crisis?"

2016: After the election it will be interesting to see how the Clinton administration allocates funds for its free in-state college tuition program.  2018: The President told a porn star he hopes all the sharks die.
