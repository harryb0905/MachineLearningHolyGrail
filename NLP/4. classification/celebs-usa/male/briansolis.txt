On @DigitalTrends, I talked about my work studying disruptive technologies and their impact on business &amp; markets. But more so, I focused on the irony, that somewhere along the way, I fell victim to those very technologies. I think most of us have too.🤔 https://t.co/fE6lOZBNC7

It's more than forming new habits/behaviors with tech, it's also getting to the source of what's really important in the future &amp; less important between now and then - "Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain" by @kevinroose https://t.co/VtdFebz0OD #lifescale
As an author, writing books in the "age of distraction" is also problematic. "Reading in the Age of Constant Distraction" by @maireadsmst 📖 https://t.co/xNzNJQZU4o  #SundayThoughts
@BruceMctague @B_resnick @patmarkey indeed...forever, that's why I used the words "well documented." but different techniques on different platforms with different intents need more study and awareness. In my research, I've found examples of polarization/isolation, misinformation, addiction, self-esteem, depression
@BruceMctague @B_resnick @patmarkey I think Pat's work is fascinating. There are multiple layers/angles to his arguments and those of others. When it comes to apps rooted in persuasive design + other techniques however, that's intentional manipulation &amp; it's well documented, but not largely understood.
@burnmyfeed @B_resnick I understand what you're saying. It's also similar to the approach that cigarettes, alcohol, drugs are not the the problem, it's the human itself. However, the point of my research is to understand impact and the point of the article is to explore roots of problems + solutions.
In my qualitative research over the years, there are notable issues that we are not contending with as a result of smartphone usage. Good article! 🧐 "Have smartphones really destroyed a generation? We don’t know." 📱https://t.co/Du3lOXc8rh @B_resnick

@marcuscouch @kanyewest @KimKardashian Btw. I appreciate your perspective and I do understand what you’re saying.
@marcuscouch @kanyewest @KimKardashian Marcus, I have. I believe in them. I rally behind jobs &amp; prison reform...directly. I didn't come to this blindly or lightly. But because he's making this about the "hat," &amp; what it represents &amp; who's behind it. What it fuels directly far outshines the far more promising narrative
@eyevariety Thank you David. As you know, I wouldn't normally share something so personal. I'm here to help you in your work/life.
@marcuscouch @kanyewest @KimKardashian I’ve been a supporter until now. I’ve surfed his waves. I’ve still paid for his art even in disagreement. This is a moment when as a fan I’ve been forced to pick a side. He’s the one who decided it’s binary. That’s not a pot calling anything other than, different and not for me.
@eyevariety @kanyewest @KimKardashian I hear you. His music has also wandered into a territory that may reflect beliefs I no longer relate to. So...that's it. I don't relate to his beliefs and his resulting art. I'm allowed to say goodbye.
In 2019, we say goodbye to @kanyewest. Also, goodbye to @kimkardashian for supporting his divisiveness. Great music is supposed to be unifying &amp; experiential.  "#Ye declares he will perform in #MAGA hat 'from now on...Just so you know where I stand." https://t.co/BRnlXvzhFU

@realDonaldTrump After talking to the publisher, we're thinking about adding "mislead" or "deceive" too and also "corrupt," again, as verbs. What do you think? Maybe the foreword and afterword?
@realDonaldTrump Forget "The Art of The Deal," your next book should be, "The Art of Distraction."  Chapters should focus on some of your greatest talents (as verbs):  Ignore Deny Blame Lie Cheat Divert Launder Bully Wing-it Coerce Obstruct Bribe Gaslight Brag  Definitely a best-seller here!

@mnburgess We don't design experiences. We design touchpoints. And those touchpoints are governed by legacy perspectives of a customer and genre that are not only dated, but increasingly irrelevant.   #ECULIVE2
@mnburgess Experience = an emotional/sensory response in a moment. It's what they feel &amp; how they react that counts. If the customer's experience is the sum of all engagements they have throughout their lifecycle, it's not just 1 moment, it's all moments combined. #ECULIVE2
@mnburgess Let's take an experiential approach to this conversation &amp; discuss it from the customer's perspective. After all, it's the customer's experience we're talking about with the emphasis on the word #experience. #ECULIVE2

But then he asked a couple of simple questions and was surprised I was sent there and allowed me to pass. His smile made all the difference. He represents the wonderful experiences I appreciate in Canada. Now, I’m on my flight continuing to Edmonton. Phew! ✈️
I mentioned that I only had 40 minutes to catch my next flight. He said, “well, you’re going this way!” 😡. I walked into a room full of others flagged for various reasons. I was greeted by another officer who took my paperwork. I asked, if it might wake a while. “Oh yeah...” 😳
Needless to say, it made for an unpleasant exhange. I was polite but clearly there was something he didn’t like. I guess I failed the last question. I just couldn’t remember the date of my last visit to Canada. So, he flagged me for additional security.
Oh @Canada, sometimes your border agents are among the loveliest folks ❤️ and in rare occasions, they’re not. Just now, @FlyYYC, I was trying to connect flights but had to go thru customs first. I was greeted by someone who saw something in me that he didn’t like.

@wired_plus #2 to disrupt takes a balance of iteration and innovation. the best innovation is personal before it's organizational. what new value will you introduce to inspire new expectations, preferences and behaviors. you don't disrupt first. it's a result of iteration + innovation.
@wired_plus #1 Iteration is doing the same things better. Innovation is doing new things that create new value. Disruption is the result of doing "new things" that make the "old things" obsolete.
