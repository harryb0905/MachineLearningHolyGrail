The hearing date for the appeal is June 3rd. #NFLlockout
... the court simply will not rule on this motion, and the temporary stay will remain in place until the court rules on the NFL‚Äôs appeal.
There is really no way of knowing when (or if) the 8th Circuit will rule on this motion.¬†It is possible, although unusual and unlikely, that
A ruling very well could be made at some point next week or it could not.
The 8th Circuit has yet to rule on the NFL‚Äôs motion for a stay of the lockout pending an appeal of the players‚Äô victory last week.
