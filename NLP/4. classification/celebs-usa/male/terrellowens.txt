How’d he do that? https://t.co/UeqejatVYh
@NBATV @IsiahThomas You have to bring up @TeamLou23 for a spot on the AllStar team if there’s talk about DRose. Understanding the West is strong with guards there should be strong consideration for Lou for what he has done consistently with every team he plays for. #PlayersOnly

A lot of people have told me that I would regret not going to Canton. I regret nothing. For an inside look at my ceremony in Chattanooga, check out my new short film WHY.  WATCH: https://t.co/ZnjomVxvyg https://t.co/Ov4WjXduWT

During my entire career the NFL and media wanted me to do things their way. When it came to the Hall of Fame induction, I had to do things my way. For an inside look and more answers, watch my new short film WHY.   VIDEO: https://t.co/ZnjomVxvyg https://t.co/OD9R13dhD0

Sometimes it’s not about the numbers sometimes it’s about the meaning and in this case it's the meaning. #THISISFORYOU https://t.co/j7slPLYo5T
@mikevpromos Yep! It was alllll about me when I trained every year, dedicated myself to my team, teammates, sacrificed my body with injuries and listened to media lie &amp; defame my character. SO YES, this about me &amp; what I've done. Don't like it, Who cares? Otherwise See ya in Chattanooga Aug 4
@mikevpromos What difference will it make? They will still say I'm being selfish. lol They're(media) gonna have something to say "no matter" what I do. Trust me, they didn't want me to come to Canton.  😂🔥 Trust. Me. Y'all think the media is talking about me now?! 🤔🤔
In due time, I will explain and give "my why" as it pertains to everyone's speculation https://t.co/9XNTWoXhbM
Real life stuff in this article. https://t.co/wLDJi3TBWY
@bigdaddy531 Just because u didn't read or hear of me saying doesn't mean that I haven't. I don't owe u or anyone an explanation. Worry about u. 👍🏾
@bigdaddy531 U sound ridiculous.
@bigdaddy531 When have u ever heard me say anything wasn't? Or r u basing ur question off what u've heard the media say?
Like Patrick said, never heard a player say I was a bad teammate. #GOFIGURE https://t.co/xaHWNOCuUV

Those that know me, know that I didn't "blow" through that amount of money but those that I hired "mismanaged and misappropriated" funds. Through my experiences I continue to share with athletes in and entering into the league to avoid similar circumstances. https://t.co/sALu1EESpn
REST IN PEACE. 🙏🏾 https://t.co/y9uSioE39p
@Himmelrover1977 Who said I regretted anything as it relates to Philly? Not my fault that a certain individual didn't like how the city embraced me. 🤷🏾‍♂️ I gave my all for the city, the organization and my other teammates.

@JarjourSami @thegreat1isme @SONTSports I heard what u had to say &amp; no I'm not coming on ur podcast after listening to the bs. And if u were real fan then u would know how to pronounce it but just like u don't know is my point that u listen to the media who should know but they don't ✌🏾
Congrats to Team #FIGHTINGCANCER! @FlagFootball
@JarjourSami @thegreat1isme antics and criminal activity is a big difference. Fan of me or not, I'm gonna do me. All of which U're talking about as it relates to me is "hearsay" not facts. Perception may be urs &amp; others reality but it's not mine.

@nwilborn19 Bro I come with the truth! #Facts
Ur sloppy journalism amongst others that has challenged &amp; questioned my character is why I'm doing me. Giving ur opinion is 1 thing &amp; I can take it but u're not gonna keep sitting on national tv telling LIES. @ShannonSharpe I respect ur opinions, sorry u're disappointed. Call me
I highly doubt the great, late Bill Walsh EVER told u that &amp; it's a shame that @fox &amp; @undisputed would allow such false info to come out of ur mouth. I, Terrell Owens, give u permission to show ANY documentation/paperwork where I got evaluated for any mental/psych conditions.
@RealSkipBayless  U still continue to lie, attack &amp; defame my character. As u know mental health is a serious issue as we've seen the national campaign with @NBA &amp; its players but to imply or suggest that I had mental problems where I was evaluated is a FLAT OUT LIE.

Do u think it's a coincidence or accident that I still shined throughout it ALL? I did because my grandmama instill in me to put my faith in God even though I knew I was being mischaracterized, misunderstood, etc. I'm not perfect but I wasn't what they portrayed. #FAITH https://t.co/n81uDE7rHK
If I had the social media platforms that we have now I woulda shut that shit down!!! #realtalk The mistake I made was trying to defend myself with interviews but all they(media) did was edit it to create their narrative which was controversial &amp; negativity. https://t.co/n81uDE7rHK
I agree. But respect deserves respect. U weren't in the locker rooms, what u think u know of me is hearsay and it's funny that u along with others hear what u wanna hear but no consideration for the teammates that has spoken highly of me &amp; know I was mischaracterized. https://t.co/GHlkD7aWCV

Wow. The power of a badge &amp; the power u don't have when u're Black. #sick https://t.co/4HUAMkEE9S
My answer was based on coach benching him, no overall different outcome in the Win, maybe u can say it helped to change flow of game to close gap but still NO CIGAR https://t.co/wQ7Qc07NOw

Hey I said I didn't agree with it but all the teams the teams that in it now in addition to the scoring have defensive tuffness. https://t.co/uGT5KCWPH5
All those teams u mentioned have more than decent perimeter shooting &amp; committed to defense. @georgewrighster, When's the last time u've seen Serge Ibaka block a shot? https://t.co/zfatzht77g
EOD, the playoffs are a different animal than regular season. It's halfcourt basketball in the playoffs homie! https://t.co/5TKEhMhRDn
Did they win?! Obviously not because they got swept. So how's that GOOD coaching? #justasking https://t.co/TDH5BAMWJQ
Ok 6/7. They didn't get swept &amp; they gave them a series with Kyrie Irving. U get my point https://t.co/JQaib0oRu4
Andrew Luck still has a job and his 100+ million dollar contract doesn't he? Would u keep him &amp; is he worth the money? https://t.co/r6ixoghtiS
#PREACH https://t.co/UbTQ4AolLI
Trust me, Valanciunas &amp; those other bench guys aren't the answer. Valancuinas played well with Bismack even tho he was a lil banged up that year but Bismack gave them defensive presence and the next Year they just let the hit go!!! WTH?! https://t.co/ANONwxY0Ad
I agree to disagree George. Contracts shouldn't dictate how they play! They lost Bismack Biyombo the year they took the Cavs to game 7. I didn't understand them not paying this guy when that's what they lacked this year was tuffness &amp; rim protection! https://t.co/ANONwxY0Ad
#1 seed to lose in 49 years bro!! They didn't just lose, they got mopped! U bench ur star player in 4th quarter &amp; u still lose the game. Expectations were way too high this year. I don't agree with it but #shithappens https://t.co/F9Kp8lHYKO

Spot on. And in doing so, Garrett felt like I was exposing him but I just wanted to win &amp; it had nothing to do with throwing me the ball. Trust me, ask Patrick Crayton, Marion Barber, etc. Hell, ask Jason Witten!! https://t.co/2DvpKVpgXM
@gimmepackluck2 Lol 😂
If telling the truth prevents is the deciding factor then probably not. Just stating #FACTS sir https://t.co/8wee9ts7Rn
What other receiver do u know of that I didn’t get along with? 😉 Me &amp; Dez woulda balled out https://t.co/5KKU7IMhLM
Consider this...Garrett &amp; Romo posse’d up to get rid of me, Garrett got Wade fired, injuries got rid of Romo...side note: if I’m there he doesn’t have those injuries because he got someone to throw to(I get open😉) Soooo...everyone is gone now... NOW u wanna blame Dak?! Stop it!! https://t.co/sxmRI3sFvG
Consider this...Garrett &amp; Romo posse’d up to got rid me, Garrett got Wade fired, injuries got rid of Romo...side note: if I’m there he doesn’t have those injuries because he got someone to throw to(I get open😉) Soooo...everyone is gone now... NOW u wanna blame Dak?! Stop it!! https://t.co/IcGRpLmery
Please don’t put that on Dak! I have no doubt based what u have witnessed from @DezBryant being a @dallascowboys fan but I know that plays are called by the OC and can only be executed with a strategic game plan. https://t.co/IcGRpLmery
U’re judging Dez based on what he did prior to the injuries. Every year is different. Is he aging, is he hurt, is he unmotivated, is he not being put in position to win at all costs to complement Dak &amp; Zeke? IDK 🤷🏾‍♂️ Best person to ask is Dez. https://t.co/IcGRpLmery
I like Dez but Dez has to play like the playmaker &amp; player u’re vouching for regardless of the situation. He has to make spectacular plays out of unexpected plays to validate the player he is &amp; justify the money they’re paying him. That’s what I did!! Ball out regardless!! https://t.co/IcGRpLmery
Also, Dez has had a few injuries that may be a factor as to why Dez can’t get open. I don’t really know because I’m not at practice every day nor do I watch every game BUT what I do see is a player not motivated to play for the Head Coach who thinks he knows it all. https://t.co/IcGRpLmery
No. Dez has turned ppl on Dez. Some of it is on him but more on Jason Garrett &amp; the OC who are responsible for putting Dez in the position to win. That means have him run routes to his strengths. Game planning is key...situational plays, down &amp; distance dictates all of that. https://t.co/IcGRpLmery

Dak is good QB &amp; with the players that he has on that team they underachieved. The coaches have to put the players in the best positions to succeed...meaning game planning, game adjustments, personnel adjustments. U can’t keep running the same obvious plays in the same formations https://t.co/Hc6UueFrhP
I only left because the QB didn’t want me there because the QB felt he could win without me. So I had to move on. Trust me, I loved what I was doing in Philly with that team but I can’t make the QB like me. 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/m2Dm9n2PF8
Same issue I had with Garrett when he felt I threw him under the bus after we went 13-3 the year before &amp; we needed to change our plays, teams game planned Dak after his 1st year but Garrett doesn’t know how to make adjustments. Can’t keep running same plays over &amp; over &amp; over https://t.co/GiByXY2tmZ
Mainly QB &amp; front office because QB didn’t like that I was a fan favorite in Philly. #realtalk https://t.co/372UmaWiJT
Who??! Jason Garrett!! 😂😂😂 U gotta be kidding me. 😂🤣 He was part of getting rid of me &amp; Wade Phillips to get the head coaching job thinking that was the answer. And here we r 8 years later...🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/xtDcTkU0Qr

We didn't have WAZE then. I was lost. Lol. https://t.co/iJpQ9T3GG9
@javer31 ok well sit back &amp; watch.
@javer31 this isn't about a promotion. U mentioned my character shouldn't be spoken for that's what I'm talking about. Did I miss something?
@javer31 u do u, u speak for u, I'm gonna do me. It's ok Javer to be different. I'm not forcing the process, maybe this is the process
Take the high road?! 😂 I am, I'm just using WAZE. U should try it. #firsttime4everything https://t.co/Fn62oyV8Su
God also gave me a mouth to voice my opinion just like theirs. Why do u think we have freedom of speech? He gave us things like twitter too😂 https://t.co/n6FpKL76mA

Can ppl really value what Mr. Polian is saying? Consider the source. I have sources too Bill. 😉 https://t.co/2H0QjD6WKg
Tell em to ask them?! They are the ones that have to look themselves in the mirror after they answer. No problem. 😉 https://t.co/6SNbPd9n60
This is for those that may be misinterpreting the tone of my tweets. 😎🙃😉 https://t.co/WxEYkWII9a
A better question for Mr. Polian, what didn't I do to make my teams better?! Before u answer, ask Coach Sherman, Stewart, Culley or Jim Mora https://t.co/fEC399x66J
I guess I need a criminal record of some sort to be included or spoken in his high praises?! 😜 God-forbidden, NOT in this life time. https://t.co/fEC399x66J
Because they think he has or gives accurate information, which is purported private conversations with "his" sources. https://t.co/wDKs7eSvQt
Tell Bill Polian to speak to Coach Ray Sherman, David Culley, George Stewart &amp; Larry Kirksey not ppl that r scared to identify themselves. 😉 https://t.co/gEPpsFSKj7
Bill is a grumpy old guy that knows "nothing" about me except for hearsay. My family name is good. https://t.co/gEPpsFSKj7
Only if Bill Walsh was alive, I guarantee he would dispel any of the such which is the smartest minds in football. https://t.co/gEPpsFSKj7
@Greggosancho I care about the fact that ppl r inaccurately portraying my character &amp; u my friend r just like a # of other judgmental ppl.
@Greggosancho u think I'm reaching out to these radio segments? U know nothing in which u're bumping ur gums about. Lol

@tjmeaney3 doesn't mean I care. What suggests that I do? 😉

Like I said, They can't pay me 15K to release my likeness https://t.co/8YRMEQsfIz
They'll be trying to do some damage control 2morr or maybe they won't. I'm not surprised by too much anymore https://t.co/MxqVTZGC4S
Lol. Exactly. https://t.co/1ARdLO41fl
What did I ever to do @EAMaddenNFL? Mad because I wouldn't accept their offer  to release my likeness when I know they make billions. https://t.co/vDRULx2SfC
They can't even pay 15K to release my likeness https://t.co/mnXuSWIOqr
I'm glad they picked me to throw shade since I've never said anything negative about @EAMaddenNFL. I wanna know who the CEO is?? https://t.co/FVI3DOkXcw
I didn't even ask for it but they can still send it &amp; I'll "drop" it right in the trash since they throwing shade https://t.co/YXsspqxPGs
Classless and Unprofessional. https://t.co/4cEXpEH4JF
They tried to be funny. Thinking a lot of ppl would jump on that weak a## tweet. https://t.co/4ldW7xisS8
Very unprofessional. https://t.co/8OWHyfrfOE
They put me on there &amp; they got a lawsuit coming quicker than I'll drop the one they send me 🤡😂 Drop the 🎤 https://t.co/nZ1n58QGaV
That's why they want my likeness to bring some excitement to the game but I'm worth more than $1500. I never have to be on it again. https://t.co/nZ1n58QGaV
Shows u how ppl think they know someone based off hearsay, never disrespected @EAMaddenNFL. My son plays it. He loves it. https://t.co/d7rCQ6S7hD
I like Tecmo Bowl myself. 😎 @EAMaddenNFL https://t.co/D1pvl9FSrZ
Not for $1500 they won't get me. The players make the game. They make billions. Billions. Just like colleges make millions off the athletes https://t.co/2CBbdm06ys

Hey the consumers know. I didn't say it. U try to clown me when I did nothing. Never have I disrespected @EAMaddenNFL but it's cool. https://t.co/IxiovJLQFF
They tried to bait me for $1500 to release my likeness. They can't get me for 15K when they generate billions. @EAMaddenNFL don't play me!! https://t.co/hjPa5E8AS5
Hey it is what it is. https://t.co/pHZF5I0WXk
It's all good homie. Funny, they've been trying to pay me $1500 to release my likeness for the game when they make billions off players https://t.co/vDRULx2SfC
@EAMaddenNFL stop asking me to be on the game. Stop underpaying guys. I never disrespected Madden, just said I didn't play it. #Blessed

@WitnessOfHis Act out?! What I did was have fun? Just because u &amp; others disagreed then oh well. Judge away.
@WitnessOfHis well this is where I tell u that u don't know me &amp; ur opinions don't matter.
Ding ding ding! Bingo! https://t.co/tD2tAK78Hi
Fought for?! 😂😂😂 those are ur words. I'm just as confused. https://t.co/3PKNHYpZvC
I'm very unique so thank u. 😎 It's called renegotiate. Teams sign guys 2 deals &amp; cut them b4 end of them so what's ur point? #nodifference https://t.co/y9GH8bgWcw
@WitnessOfHis call it what u misunderstood or perceived but I call it confidence.
Year 2 of what? https://t.co/7zA7v5Smzx
@JasonColeBR I hope this engagement isn't enhancing ur job position because u're terrible. Way off base! https://t.co/hzhpgqwsZw
Because I wanted to choose a team with the opportunity to go to the SB &amp; compliment my talent. So that's why. Anything else?! 😎 https://t.co/vqMGY3S81A
Always. https://t.co/Tg4L2cgp36
U asked me why &amp; I told u. The Eagles were interested. So what's ur point?! I didn't force anything. Refer back to my Eli Manning question. https://t.co/yZSHeRZrmr
Come on @JasonColeBR. Whatever u try to accuse me of there r plenty of examples well before me. U better stop before someone gets ur job. 😜😂 https://t.co/FWp8tsl6Hu
Beyond ridiculous. Trust me, it's the @SteveMariucci's of the world that smile in ur face and say what "needs" to be said on tv. #fakelove https://t.co/kSethTS7TQ
That was business. Was I or am I the only one to do that? Didn't Eli Manning get drafted to Chargers? What did he do? #checkmate 😉😜 https://t.co/QPRaiVteYB
No disrespect but they had a young QB &amp; correction, I NEVER held out. See, u guys listen to everything that is said from anonymous sources https://t.co/QPRaiVteYB
@WitnessOfHis Have been. Just because u don't see it or it's not publicized doesn't mean that I'm not. Only God can judge me.

Nothing personal, just addressing ur jabs in well written article. 😉😎😜 https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
My diminished skills had to be amazing to  produce more than the leading guys of the last 2 teams considering they were younger than I was. https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
That's ur honest opinion. So there's nothing wrong with the way it came across to u personally. I view it as confidence. https://t.co/U4zzka0GHH
Ask George Stewart, David Culley &amp; Ray Sherman what kind of person &amp; teammate I was? They coached &amp; saw me EVERYDAY. Not short encounters. https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
No doubt! Always. https://t.co/OCAbt2PEYQ
What's fascinating is that there are many that have spoken about me as a good teammate but it's not taken into consideration. Why is that?! https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
U bought what ur "selective group" of people sold u but I'll go 2 my grave knowing that I was a good teammate &amp; that #HOForNot I'll be ok. 😉 https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
Unlike other sports, NFL contracts aren't guaranteed so if I was such a "horrible" teammate or person then why didn't they cut me? https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
Ask those people what made me a "horrible" teammate? Name or show em to me &amp; I'll show u a liar. #realtalk https://t.co/kwfPuhoRRN
