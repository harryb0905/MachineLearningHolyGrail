Ppl gonna see this score &amp; think the defenses didnt show up. The defense on both teams have made some HUGE plays.
All this game needs is a kickoff return for a Touchdown. Its had everything else.
This game is nuts. I'm screaming at the tv &amp; I really don't care who wins. I just love NFL football.

Fuck this shit.
When is last time someone punted against the Bengals?
It‚Äôs clear Burfict don‚Äôt wanna get fined or suspended he‚Äôs playing tentative.
Another missed tackle!!!
OK Now Defense wrap up!!!
Scandrick can't guard @ajgreen_18
@ajgreen_18 @Joe_MainMixon dont go away from whats working.
Kansas City's offense is everything Cincinnati fans say ours could be.
Can we miss anymore tackles?
SMH
Bobby Hart #68 is shook. He is self check right now.
Kansas City's punter can grab a beer. I don't think he's gonna be working tonight.
OK!!!! Come on offense. We caught a break.
No catch
William Jackson dont test him. But missed tackles are killing us!!!
Unreal. Mixon has 2 carries.
Ok @ajgreen_18 WORKS ALSO.
Mixon has to have at least 20 carries. Bengals gotta keep Chiefs offense off the field.
Feed Joe Mixon!!!! WTF?
Well that sucks
I said the same thing, weird. https://t.co/0FPcEnjipm
So nobody picked the Bengals tonight. Thta's ok time to make the "experts" wrong.
Keys tonight isolate William Jackson on Tyreek Hill. Feed Joe Mixon gotta win time of possession against the Chiefs.
No way another kicker blows it. Sorry Dallas.
Justin Tucker missed an extra point. I'm buying Mega Million lottery tickets ASAP. Anything is possible.

If Lebron leaves Cleveland those courtside seats will be buy 1 get 1 free.
Lebron gives his guys so many open 3's. It's like playing pop a shot. Just sit there wait for the ball to come back to you.
DAMN Cavs have gone ice cold. Warriors are the best 3rd quarter team I've ever seen.
If Rodney Hood stays locked in Cavs are so much better with him instead of Jordan Clarkson.
Yes but he needs some black guys to help also. #whiteguytweet https://t.co/gAVj5bRYK0

If I'm the Eagles I let the Patriots score right away. Get the ball back.
Oh shit down by 5 points 2 minutes left. Tom Brady says " HOLD MY BEER" goes into game.
Patriots win or lose are always in Super Bowls that go down to the wire. Minus the 1986 vs The Bears.
