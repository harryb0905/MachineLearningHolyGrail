There is an instructive metaphor in #KimJongUn’s decision to take the armored train to the Hanoi summit with @realDonaldTrump. The president encourages North Korea to leap forward economically and geopolitically. But Kim sticks with what he knows, controls and keeps him secure.
So @realDonaldTrump insisted during the 2016 presidential campaign that #Mexico would pay for his great wall. Now, pretending there is a national emergency that doesn’t exist, he will attempt to get the U.S. military to pay for it instead.
God wanted @realDonaldTrump, who disregards the moral guideposts of the Bible and other sacred books every day, to be President? Given Trump’s lack of honesty and humility and disregard for the well-being and dignity of the least among us, God must have a wicked sense of humor.
U.S. ambassadors can be trusted to advance the national interest at posts around the world but not with what they post on their private Twitter accounts. The existing @StateDept policy is unnecessary bureaucratic overreach. https://t.co/6dFIm68Cpk via @defenseone
This is an important story. There certainly was collusion, meaning Trump campaign officials cooperated with Russian operatives interested in gaining relief from U.S. sanctions imposed after the Ukraine invasion. Whether this amounts to a criminal conspiracy remains to be proven. https://t.co/8hRtyEOSGj
Good interview with @PeterAlexander @MSNBC on #INFTreaty. Putin uses nuclear capability to support his political narrative that #Russia is back. He's happy to have another conflict with Washington. And it underscores how @realDonaldTrump misread what was achievable with Russia.
Presidents disagree with intelligence assessments all the time. But it usually happens in the White House Situation Room, not on Twitter. The intel chiefs didn’t disagree with Trump’s strategy, but they did torch his naive assessment of his own foreign policy accomplishments. https://t.co/76C0hTAtY2
The president agrees to reopen the government while negotiations on border security continue, precisely where things stood five weeks ago. So this destructive and embarrassing shutdown occurred only because @realDonaldTrump didn't like what right wing commentators said about him.
In the abstract, @realDonaldTrump's engagement strategy with #NorthKorea is reasonable. But he accused Obama of blindly pursuing a bad deal with #Iran. In reality, Trump is chasing #KimJongUn, wishing and hoping as the song goes without knowing what Kim is actually willing to do. https://t.co/BMddVMTMnX
Trump's threat to retaliate against #Turkey if they attack the Kurds in #Syria is reminiscent of the 1992 Bush "Christmas warning" regarding the Serbs and #Kosovo. While a legitimate policy position, history suggests one or both parties will test that commitment at some point. https://t.co/xJyzL2Piqf
@nytimes The GREATEST presidency in American history has done it again! They said U.S. forces won’t leave #Syria until ISIS is defeated, the Kurds are protected and Iranian influence is greatly reduced. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED in just days! (And the check from #Mexico is in the mail)
Ambassador Jim Jeffrey takes over as envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition in addition to his #Syria duties, yet another Trump advisor wearing two or more hats. At this rate, by the end of his term, the president will be able to fit his entire national security team in a compact car.
But curiously not Russia. He believes it’s useful to have a constructive relationship with Russia even though that is not in the cards. Meanwhile he plays the rest of his hand miserably. https://t.co/0W44IJ3jDE
General Mattis’ resignation suggests a complete breakdown of the national security decision making process. Not only is the leading adult leaving the international stage, but there is no institutional mechanism to make future developments any better. https://t.co/2qwy3Mc7UK
Few presidents confronted the geo-political complexity that George H.W. Bush did. He was clear-eyed about America’s long term interests, punishing Iraq’s naked aggression, creating a path for Europe to unify, and imagining Middle East peace. His was a consequential presidency.
Behind the #Khashoggi murder is a vital question: Is #MBS a reformer? Reformers don’t kill opponents in consulates. The president misreads why Saudi Arabia is important. If the Kingdom reforms, the Middle East evolves as well. If not, the region will be, well, meaner and nastier. https://t.co/l7Q0itK9F7
Julian Assange was not charged for releasing classified U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010. Free press rights may be forfeited when @WikiLeaks willingly joins forces with Russia’s intelligence services with the clear intent of influencing the result of the 2016 presidential campaign.
@HayekCaroline @LOrientLeJour I just arrived in Beirut. Perhaps we can connect tomorrow on the margins of the May Chidiac Conference at the Phoenicia. You can email me at pj@crowleyglobal.net. Easier to communicate.
The Trump administration wants #Iran to fundamentally change the nature of its regime, something ironically it does not demand of #NorthKorea. Sanctions can’t achieve that. Let’s remember, for lots of reasons on both sides, nothing in this relationship is ever simple. https://t.co/Bdee78Pu8Z
The roadmap would be to rejoin an expanded JCPOA that includes an understanding on missiles. But it will require #Iran to reengage as well. This all depends on election results in #America in 2020 and #Iran in 2021. Thanks for reading and responding. https://t.co/p9PGLo4bNp
Secretary Mattis helped develop new doctrine a decade ago that advised troops to employ less force in situations where civilians are present. The President is all but encouraging a lethal confrontation with civilians at the border, purely for domestic political gain. A stunt yet? https://t.co/z4QaSj0hvK
The U-Md Board of Regents misdiagnosed its problem, failed to respond based on the values of the university, did not present a convincing case in defense of its decision and misread how key constituencies would respond, all text book examples of how not to manage a crisis. https://t.co/9mxpPgzVgR
Gee, it’s amazing that a president would withdraw from international agreement such as the #JCPOA and #ParisClimateAgreement that are working. The United States gets shellacked, international goodwill gone. Presidents don’t do this all the time. Big mistake! https://t.co/8HDmGR2wQB
Four problems linger with the new #Saudi story: the decision to abduct #JamalKhashoggi in the first place, the doctor with the bone saw, the disposition of the body, and the high level lies. They undermine MBS’s commitment to reform and transparency, the leading U.S. interest.
Looking forward to a discussion on #NorthKorea @BloombergTV this afternoon. There will be another Kim-Trump summit soon. Kim wants a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. The question is what will he do on denuclearization to get it. At this point, we still don’t know.
There is an interesting foreign policy lesson in Europe’s decisive #RyderCup18 triumph. There was great individual effort all around, but Europe demonstrated better teamwork. Yes, they played on familiar terrain, but they simply worked better collectively than the U.S. did alone.
An updated definition of chutzpah: @realDonaldTrump, who famously complained about “shit hole countries,” demands respect from other countries in return for U.S. support. #UNGA2018
Ah, the Monroe Doctrine lives. Expect Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to salute @realDonaldTrump for recognizing regional spheres of influence
Yes, the solution to migration is making other countries “great again.” But this is not something the United States can manage alone, thus the need for a global compact to jointly manage global migration that continues to grow, whether we like it or not.
Globalism is not a “doctine.” Global interdependence and interconnections are simply the way the world is currently working. The challenge is how to manage its impacts, both positive and negative.
Once again, repeating something over and over — the U.S. decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem as a “recognition of reality” — does not make it true. It’s hard to see how the embassy and other moves have in any way advanced the peace process. They haven’t.
I agree with @PressSec. The anonymous official who wrote the @nytimes op ed should resign and explain his or her concerns about Trump's worst impulses to the American people. Of course, regarding Russia, @realDonaldTrump has put his ego ahead of the national interest repeatedly. https://t.co/ftlD3yDAEw
Just when you think @realDonaldTrump’s political pettiness cannot fall any lower, we learn that the American flag at the White House was returned to full staff despite the national period of mourning for @SenJohnMcCain. The contrast between a true hero and a fool is compelling.
God bless @SenJohnMcCain. He served the country with great distinction, led by example and always challenged America to be better.
Trump tweet translation: The North Korea nuclear problem is not resolved (not my fault). Neither is the China trade problem (not my fault). Pompeo wasn’t going to get anywhere in Pyongyang (not my fault). But I wasn’t played by Kim in Singapore and can’t wait to see him again. https://t.co/BwRm95CsLP
Admiral McRaven is demonstrating one again personal courage and genuine leadership. https://t.co/bHLyQxMrvp
Those of us honored to know Judge Bill Webster admire his thoughtful approach to complex issues. He listens. He observes. He gains perspective. And when he speaks, we pay close attention. Our citizens and elected representatives should as well. https://t.co/M8MSLqPUxL
@NBCNightlyNews This lacks credibility. If @realDonaldTrump misspoke, @PressSec had ample time to correct the record before leaving #Helsinki or on the flight home. It wasn’t until they arrived back at the White House and sensed the brewing firestorm that magically “wouldn’t” replaces “would.”
Reflecting on today's stunning #TrumpPutinSummit in Helsinki, @realDonaldTrump seemed to be Putin's Perry Mason, seeking to generate reasonable doubt for his client. What about the Pakistani guy? Where's the server? But playing defense counsel for #Russia is not a @POTUS role.
In response to a direct question, who do you believe regarding interference in the 2016 campaign, your intelligence agencies or #Russia, @realDonaldTrump dissembles. This is negligence, a profound failure to protect the United States from foreign threats.
So @realDonaldTrump leaves #Helsinki having declared #Russia a “competitor” and #Europe a “foe.” This is historic — no modern president has ever said such a thing — and deeply troubling. No doubt #Putin encouraged Trump’s instincts and will exploit his statements going forward.
Sleep well tonight. After a mere four hours together, @realDonaldTrump has personally changed the relationship between the United States and #Russia. Look forward to seeing the terms of the “contract” where #Putin promised he would never interfere with American global interests.
So @realDonaldTrump wants an “extraordinary relationship” with #Russia. What would its foundations be? Shared history? Ah, no. Shared interests? Well, not many. Shared values? Not with Putin’s managed democracy, although Trump clearly finds that appealing. That’s extraordinary.
A good relationship with #Russia is not itself an objective, but a means to advance American interests. @realDonaldTrump has not said what he wants from Russia. But we have 20 years of experience (which Trump ignores) that building a rapport with #Putin doesn’t get you very far.
Bush 43 sought a better relationship with #Russia but adapted his policy after its incursion into #Georgia. Obama did the same in light of #Ukraine and #Syria. @realDonaldTrump has not adapted his thinking despite mounting evidence of its 2016 election intereference. Stunning.
The problem with seeking an “extraordinary relationship” with #Russia is that it does not serve the interests of the United States. Putin’s doing everything he can not to giggle during the pre-game meeting with the media.
@realDonaldTrump U.S. foolishness? Wrong to object to Russia’s incursion into #Ukraine and appropriation of Crimea? Wrong to object to Russia salvaging Assad’s brutal dictatorship in #Syria? Wrong to question Putin’s dismemberment of independent Russian institutions? You can’t be serious.
Over the course of just a couple of days, @realDonaldTrump says he believes in #NATO but the #EU is a foe? If you are a European leader, what are you supposed to do, shoot yourself? After dealing with this president, some might be tempted.
The best of British humor, and well deserved. https://t.co/nhBmvkiXNU
Congratulations to #Croatia for a valiant victory in the #WorldCup2018 semi-final. Things go from bad to worse for #England and PM Theresa May. The collective punishment for losing a chance to play in the final is having to host @realDonaldTrump. Should qualify as torture.
Not surprisingly, @realDonaldTrump has his geopolitics upside down. Who would you rather be, Merkel or Putin? The former leads one of the world’s most vibrant economies, the latter one of the most corrupt. It’s not even close. Germany’s position is sustainable, Russia’s is not. https://t.co/fIxtfkG5nO
How odd is it that @realDonaldTrump introduces Ronald Reagan’s Attorney General while announcing his Supreme Court pick, but not his own? Trump says the Court should be free of political interference. Good advice for so-called judges.
Kim Jong Un shook my hand and said he would take care of everything. Problem solved. Sleep well. But the two sides have different definitions of what denuclearization means. That’s what the actual negotiations are for. Kim didn’t play @realDonaldTrump. Trump is self-deluded. https://t.co/DQic4rFAdT
As @realDonaldTrump announces his Supreme Court pick, what should be obvious is the profound difference between the progressive and conservative political movements. Elections are about candidates, but they are much more about the political agendas those candidates embrace.
David Kramer presents an all too plausible outline @washingtonpost of how the Trump-Putin discussion might unfold, to the detriment of American national security interests. Putin will be well prepared to take advantage of Trump’s instincts. https://t.co/PZaRQeEX6M
So we have an all @NATO and all #EU final in the #WorldCup2018. If @realDonaldTrump notices, he'll   find a way to criticize it as yet another allied weakness. God knows what he thinks about sharing #WorldCup2026 with #Canada and #Mexico.
@realDonaldTrump There is utility in any meeting between the American and Russian presidents, but there is danger in @realDonaldTrump's willful blindness regarding what happened in 2016 and the divergent interests of the two countries. But we'll be invited to "sleep well" after this meeting too.
In Trumpworld, the 159-page Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with #Iran solved nothing, yet the 442-word joint statement with #NorthKorea (references to Trump, Kim, Singapore and history represented 19 percent of the text) solved everything. This isn't naive. It's delusional. https://t.co/znMNNDPfyi
Betrayal? Didn’t @realDonaldTrump say multiple times that, just as he acts based on an #AmericaFirst agenda, he expects other leaders to aggressively pursue their national interests as well? And still he and his accolites are surprised when @JustinTrudeau actually does that. https://t.co/n5IFNO5852
For once, @realDonaldTrump was completely accurate about the crowd size. It was the biggest gathering ever for a White House event commemorating the dis-invitation of a Super Bowl champion, whose players were almost uniformly uninterested in sharing a stage with him. Yuge! https://t.co/JthKVEvE9c
Two known unknowns govern whether the June 12 U.S.-DPRK summit can or should be salvaged. Kim wants security and prosperity, but will he trade his nukes and missiles in return? Trump wants denuclearization, but will he go through incremental steps over many years to get there? https://t.co/mWl8tm2BQ9
A back to reality moment for @realDonaldTrump. He believed he could defy diplomatic gravity and achieve something historic. But #NorthKorea has long been the graveyard of such ambitions. A meeting can still happen but more work is needed as to what is actually achievable and how. https://t.co/VENaVdq2g1
Bottom line from Secretary of State Pompeo @StateDept regarding new post-JCPOA #Iran strategy: lots of U.S. demands without clear leverage. The Trump administration can’t generate unprecedented economic pressure given unless other major players cooperate. That’s unknown.
Interesting that @StateDept Secretary Pompeo references #NorthKorea in his remarks about #Iran. If #Iran is led by a horrible regime that refuses to meet the needs of its people, is that not also true of the #Kim regime? Why are they not entitled to something better?
Obama’s engagement strategy with #Iran lasted basically four years, replacing a strategy of isolation that didn’t move the needle much over 35 years. But we’re heading back to our traditional confrontational posture despite its lack of apparent success.
A great insight. And, like the health care debate, there were offers to make the existing deal better, which @realDonaldTrump chose to ignore. https://t.co/TyK2iMRHdg
There is no prospect of a better deal - Iran will not negotiate away what it views as national rights - so we're going to test the proposition advanced by critics of the JCPOA that no deal is better than the existing one. https://t.co/erKkD07H2F
The best kind of #RussianCollusion. Evgeny Kuznetsov @Kuzya92, Alex Ovechkin @ovi8 and Dmitry Orlov @orlov_09 combine for the winning goal over the @penguins in overtime to send the @WashingtonCapitals to the @NHL Eastern Conference Finals. #ALLCAPS
The Trump argument is withdrawal from the JCPOA is justified because #Iran was a “dishonest actor” prior to the negotiation. This requires them to argue that, despite #NorthKorea’s history of duplicity, #KimJongUn is a Boy Scout. Good luck with that! https://t.co/7DRqCqxHQA
Reciprocity is one of @realDonaldTrump's favorite words but it works both ways. The Macron and Merkel visits underscore how our allies are trying to respond to the president's priorities such as trade and security but he is not responding to theirs, such as climate and Iran.
@JimGoldgeier German integration is still a work in progress a quarter century after it occurred. The gap between the two Koreas is even greater. There are crucial differences. For one, China will not leave North Korea to its own devices as Russia did with East Germany.
Give #KimJongUn credit. He offers two "concessions," gestures regarding testing and U.S. forces, that don't cost him anything. In the process, he is raising the price for giving up his nuclear capability and putting pressure on @realDonaldTrump to respond in kind when they meet. https://t.co/Qel8VhVguW
Many believe @realDonaldTrump pardoned Scooter Libby to send a message to campaign officials facing indictment: Hang in there and I'll pardon you. But in #AHigherLoyalty, @comey details how he appointed Patrick Fitzgerald and recused himself from the Libby case. It rhymes.
The Trump administration has actually drawn a sharper red line than @BarackObama did. If Assad fails to heed the message to stop using chemical weapons,  @realDonaldTrump may have a hard time getting out of #Syria. https://t.co/IzMfKUvb4z
So, @KellyannePolls, the self-described purveyor of "alternative facts," accuses @Comey of revisionist history. And @PressSec, whose biography is entirely about politics, calls a former US Attorney, Deputy AG and FBI Director a "partisan hack." As the military says, #YGBSM.
SFRC deserves credit for an incredibly informative confirmation hearing with Director #Pompeo. Many key policies probed and legitimate concerns raised, but he is qualified to be Secretary of State, will certainly manage the department better than his predecessor.
Director Pompeo suggested in his confirmation hearing that @realDonaldTrump and #KimJongUn will evaluate when they meet whether conditions exist to resume negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program. He seemed open to negotiations. That’s not likely John Bolton’s position.
I don't see a deep mystery regarding #MichaelCohen. He paid off #StormyDaniels, expecting to be reimbursed after the election he thought his client would lose. He was stuck with the bill when @realDonaldTrump won and legal troubles from the #Russia investigation that ensued.
It’s fascinating how #Tulsa’s @WoodyGuthrieCtr highlights the impact the man-made Dust Bowl environmental disaster had on Guthrie’s life and lyrics, and then realize @EPAScottPruitt, who denies global warming, comes from this community and yet learned so little from this history.
It is strange that @realDonaldTrump referred to security commitments to the Baltic States rooted in declarations from 1940 and 1998 and not #NATO membership, which the Baltic States achieved in 2004.
With his trip to Beijing and anticipated summits with the presidents of #SouthKorea and the #UnitedStates, Kim Jong Un has turned U.S. policy on its head. He is in control of the process and has increased his bargaining power. https://t.co/UMdm7Sl4uG
If you want to be optimistic about the future of #America, it is in the number of young people who have joined the #marchforourlives and want to overturn our existing political stalemate. They have inspired us. Next they need to vote!
I was at dinner in late 2016 with some former European diplomats when Rex Tillerson emerged as the nominee for @StateDept. While unknown, they expressed relief that @realDonaldTrump's choice was not @AmbJohnBolton. EU diplomats will not sleep well tonight given the latest news.
Well, with Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster's ouster, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is the only policy realist left within National Security Team Trump. And with @AmbJohnBolton's arrival, there is little doubt that the #Iran nuclear deal is toast. https://t.co/8K7qlYdxL7
A few moments ago, @realDonaldTrump said the arms race with #Russia is getting out of control. But he added we will not let anyone come close to the U.S. full spectrum military capability, a strategic logic that will intensify that arms race. Business as usual in the Oval Office.
In the end, Rex Tillerson was fired because he tried to be the United States Secretary of State more than the Trump Administration Secretary of State. @realDonaldTrump resented it, just as he has with Jeff Session’s failure to be his Attorney General.
This has to be the work of #Russian bots. There is no way even the most casual observer of @StateDept could believe this. Jim Baker is light years ahead because he had a way better boss who actually knew things AND listened to good advice. https://t.co/pAIaR8XZRy
One of @StateDept’s long-term challenges has been the relatively brief tenures of the USD for #PublicDiplomacy, not staying long enough to continue integrating PD and traditional diplomacy. Sadly that trend continues with Steve Goldstein’s departure after only four months.
Be careful what you wish for. No doubt @StateDept will function better. But substantively diplomacy will turn sharply right. Blowing up the #Iran deal becomes more likely, which will make #NorthKorean negotiations even more challenging. https://t.co/29vkgxsraR
Not only does @realDonaldTrump agree to a meeting with North Korean leader #KimJongUn without any preparatory work, now he will prepare for the meeting with complete turmoil at the Department of State. https://t.co/aGrQ8jRF9y
The biggest hurdle to a North Korean nuclear deal: American politics https://t.co/ocQVjKG9OI
Secretary Tillerson in #Djibouti tried to explain @realDonaldTrump’s impulsive decision to meet with #KimJongUn, that conditions are right for talks but not yet negotiations. So we traded a presidential meeting for a three-month testing moratorium. A good deal for #NorthKorea.
As we contemplate high-level talks with #NorthKorea, the lack of expertise within the Trump administration is apparent. With #Iran, Obama put his Secretary of Energy, a nuclear physicist, on his negotiating team. I’m not seeing the same potential from Trump’s Secretary of Coal.
North Korea has talked about denuclearization for 25 years. They are good at talking about it, but not doing it. @realDonaldTrump must decide what he is willing to give to get denuclearization and how to verify it. North Korea’s price has gone up since we did this the last time. https://t.co/EYdiOzgcQE
That’s right, he has been the Hermit leader of the Hermit kingdom, which is why this should not be a home game for him. And remember, as far as we know, the only American to meet him is Dennis Rodman. I cannot recall a presidential meeting in modern times with so many unknowns. https://t.co/N6bE3WTSvJ
Turning diplomacy on its head, @realDonaldTrump will kick start negotiations with #NorthKorea without a lot of expert spade work ahead of time. Trump considers himself a great negotiator, but he has given #KimJongUn a huge win upfront. The meeting should not be in #Pyongyang.
The United States should test #NorthKorea’s apparent willingness to return to nuclear talks, but no one should hold their breath waiting for a breakthrough. To paraphrase former Defense Secretary Bob Gates, we’ve seen this horse before. It wasn’t what it appeared to be.
Looking forward to a chat with @CNN @donlemon about the lack of a government-wide response to #Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and its problematic policies elsewhere, the chaos behind @realDonaldTrump’s tariff announcement and other foreign policy issues.
Another example that @realDonaldTrump is not a detail guy: he misleadingly suggested spending $250,000 to adapt the existing American consulate in #Jerusalem to accommodate an office for the U.S. ambassador precludes spending $1 billion to build a permanent and secure embassy.
Extraordinary tribute to the victims of the #Parkland tragedy by the @FlaPanthers. And heartfelt words from Goalie RobertoLuongo @strombone1 in defense of the students who have challenged us all to take meaningful action in response to these senseless school shootings.
A thoughtful review by @JRubinBlogger of the various talking points employed by elected representatives following our too frequent school shootings to justify the status quo. https://t.co/9NbGFVh9j4
I would love to hear our elected representatives explain why someone who is not old enough to vote or enlist in the military is nonetheless old enough to legally own an AR-15 military grade assault weapon. It's a mystery to me. Sympathies to the families of the #Parkland tragedy.
Fascinated by the #Olympic gold medal #curling final between #Canada and #Switzerland. Can’t think of two countries about which almost no one has a negative thought. Of course that could change as the hockey competition progresses.
Here's where we are as with #NorthKorea as we watch the Olympics. Notwithstanding Trump's "fire and fury," we're actually left with more strategic patience. https://t.co/Mt96s8pwjI
Give #SouthKorea enormous credit for its #Olympic gesture, including #NorthKorea in the opening ceremony. This gesture of respect boosts Seoul’s international stature — sports diplomacy at its best. And the drone formation of the Olympic Rings was truly cool.
Breaking news @MSNBC: @realDonaldTrump has read the infamous Hill memo on the Russia investigation and the FISA application. Wait, what? The president is now actually reading important stuff on the job that doesn’t include pictures and charts? Wow!
The national flush when the #SOTU finally ends will rival halftime at the Super Bowl. But alas, no commercials.
Is he done yet? #SOTU
If the next captured terrorist goes to #GTMO rather than a civilian court, we will be unwinding one of the most effective tools we have used to bring terrorists to justice since September 11. Civilian courts have delivered exponentially more convictions than military tribunals.
Does watching #SOTU qualify as cruel and unusual punishment? This is awful.
We’ve improved our standing in the world? And part of his plan to strengthen it is to keep #GTMO in business? You have to be kidding me.
In #SOTU, @realDonaldTrump cited four pillars to better border security but dropped one. I guess #Mexico is no longer paying for the wall.
There is no evidence in the #SOTU speech that @realDonaldTrump learned anything new in his first year in office. A lot of it is recycled.
If there was a successful trade renegotiation in 2017, I missed it. @realDonaldTrump withdrew from TPP, threatened South Korea and put NAFTA in peril. That’s not progress. #SOTU
So, @realDonaldTrump finally makes a new policy proposal, and it is to fire civil servants who “undermine the public trust” by disagreeing with his next crazy idea. Really?
The war against coal is over. @realDonaldTrump lost. Global energy markets have already moved on to better and cleaner sources of energy.
We’re what, a third of the way through #SOTU, and @realDonaldTrump has not provided one new policy proposal for 2018. So much for the vision thing.
Osama bin Laden was killed on #Pakistani soil. Mullah Omar died in a Pakistani hospital. Yes, Pakistan is battling some terrorists. But it is also supporting others. The government remains unwilling to confront its own foreign policy. https://t.co/TlH8ZJtZE9
The military has compelling readiness needs. The services have been continuously engaged in major military campaigns for 30 years. But it makes little strategic sense to expand military funding while simultaneously cutting our diplomatic capabilities. They go hand in hand. https://t.co/FQkXY0rP7Q
Most of the @realDonaldTrump speech at #wef18 is not new. What is confusing is the idea of reengaging as a group the nations he stiffed when he withdrew from #TPP. They have moved on. Why would they want to go through the same drama Mexico and Canada are experiencing with #NAFTA?
So let’s recap the action. The White House Chief of Staff says the president’s campaign positions were uninformed, but have evolved since coming to office. Mr. Trump’s response is, I had it all right from the outset and haven’t needed to learn anything new over the past year. https://t.co/wsYIU2aUQU
Headline on @CNN: @realDonaldTrump's border positions on the presidential campaign were uninformed. This is not a startling revelation.
If I understand subsequent reporting, the so-called “misrepresentation” hinges on whether @realDonaldTrump said “shithouse” or “shithole” countries, as if one is less reprehensible than the other. Those attempting to defend this behavior are bankrupt. https://t.co/2rLKn5k0i1
Dear @CBSThisMorning: You just confused the public servant on the left for the public servant on the right. Raj Shah on the right has defended @POTUS' horrific and obscene language regarding developing countries. Raj Shah on the left has spent the past decade trying to help them. https://t.co/Qt8BA4dgJg
The new template for diplomatic readouts going forward. The Secretary of State met with the foreign minister of (fill in the country). They discussed a range of regional and bilateral priorities. The Secretary reiterated the United States does not view its ally as a "shithole."
The Trump base can applaud all it wants, but it is impossible to argue that the United States under this president is achieving new heights of international respect. The "shithole" and non-"shithole" countries will be equally and rightly appalled at such distain. https://t.co/PVpu0p2o6d
Looking forward to discussing #NorthKorea and the unhelpful rhetoric around big buttons with @AymanM and @SCClemons @MSNBC during the 6 pm hour.
While @statedeptspox is absolutely correct about the basic human right to protest peacefully, our credibility regarding freedom of expression is undermined every day by a president who rejects all criticism as "fake news" and labels the mainstream media "enemies of the people." https://t.co/Gbc2MLYReJ
During the Cold War, we compared nuclear throw-weights. Now we brandish our bigger buttons. Surely the Cold War would have ended sooner if Kennedy, following Khrushchev's shoe waving at the @UN, had reassured the free world that his foot was bigger. Sad! https://t.co/TRWhcjXsoD
Thoughtful discussion @MSNBC with @craigmelvin, @agearan and @AymanM on #Iran, #North Korea and #Pakistan. It will be best for U.S. policy to keep the focus on the Iranian government’s response to the protests. Of course, that is not how @realDonaldTrump normally operates.
Thoughtful discussion regarding #NorthKorea and #Iran. I don’t see a mixed message in Kim Jong Un’s New Year message. He wants to relaunch international negotiations but on his terms, with a recognition of Pyongyang’s emerging nuclear capability. https://t.co/IjRtDTCZ2q
Chuck Todd @MeetThePress asked his panel of experts if there is a #Trump Doctrine. Why assume someone who came the Oval Office without any foreign policy experience has a coherent world view? The Trump Doctrine is its absence, a foreign policy rooted in impulse, not strategy.
Given how lopsided the vote was on the #Jerusalem resolution, I'll wager the Trump administration will retaliate against the UN rather than individual countries, putting us back in the same counterproductive cycle where we were two decades ago.
All major U.S. allies across the region who are supposed to help the United States deliver on its "outside-in" strategy to achieve a Middle East peace agreement voted for the #Jerusalem resolution despite U.S. threats. Think they know something the Trump administration doesn't? https://t.co/RUjNmSVR35
Three days after releasing its national security strategy, with a key pillar the advancement of American influence, the Trump administration loses a one-sided vote, 9-128-35, after needlessly threatening friends and aspiring partners over a sure-to-pass #Jerusalem resolution.
Just to consider how "unstrategic" the foolish U.S. threat to cut aid over the sure-to-pass #UNGA resolution on #Jerusalem is, it puts weak governments in #Iraq and #Afghanistan in a difficult spot, serving up a potent political wedge issue to America's regional adversaries.
The Clinton Administration established a economic policy directorate within the National Security Council staff. That happened 25 years ago. https://t.co/X2I5NiWirD
Let's see, we're going to magically repair our domestic infrastructure, including our rail system, even as we pass a tax bill that adds $1.5 trillion to the national debt.
If American energy has been under "lock and key," then how did the United States move over the past decade from being an energy importer to an independent energy exporter? #FakeRhetoric
The Trump national security strategy outlines sensible goals - protect the homeland, advance the economy, preserve military strength and extend America's global influence. But specific Trump actions its first year on trade, climate and immigration seem to undermine these goals.
OK, but are you old enough to remember 2001-2008, the last time Republicans controlled the economy and thought a massive tax cut on top of a booming market was a great idea, leaving no margin for error when the good times went bust? #ShortMemory https://t.co/1ZrO72piB3
I'm still stuck on @realDonaldTrump's insistence we must recognize reality regarding Jerusalem. Trump criticized Obama for recognizing reality regarding Iranian enrichment. We have not recognized reality regarding North Korea's nuclear capability. These are all policy choices. https://t.co/aAfVa5PhJc
Once again, the Trump administration is at odds with itself. It is intrigued by the idea of a peace agreement. Yet the #JerusalemEmbassy move, done unilaterally without a well calibrated reciprocal gesture to the #Palestinians, will make the "ultimate deal" harder to achieve. https://t.co/GjW5oojXZU
Jared Kushner @BrookingsInst overestimates the level of trust between Israelis and Palestinians. The two communities do not know each other as well as they did 25 years ago.
As he enters court this morning, does #MichaelFlynn appreciate the irony that, after leading chants at the Republican Convention to "lock her up," he now has to convince a federal judge that he should not go to jail?
Trying to keep up with @PressSec. Today she claims the veracity of a discredited video doesn't matter. Yesterday she justified @realDonaldTrump's tasteless criticism because @SenWarren lied. Ah yes, the real threat is reality. https://t.co/0ZVFGa8uYm
Just finished reading and highly recommend #LosingAnEnemy by @tparsi. Agree with his bottom line: #Iran is a regional power. It is better for both countries to maintain a relationship, identifying areas of common interest and managing inevitable conflicts.
Also stunning about this story, McMaster critics are alarmed that he believes Israeli settlements are a problem. This has been the official U.S. position for, oh, 20 years. https://t.co/iB03Oge6V5
The #Sony cyber attack certainly justifies #NorthKorea's return to the terrorism list, but it's unclear what this means beyond looking tough. https://t.co/ZVTqngKWY0
@WACReading Great program @WACReading talking about foreign policy, domestic politics and what this intersection means for challenges like #NorthKorea.
Great discussion @donlemon @CNN on @POTUS Asia trip. A big question over the next two weeks: Will #KimJongUn try to steal the spotlight?
Yet another Trumpian contradiction. There is no such thing as swift justice at #Guantanamo. That ship sailed a long, long, long time ago. https://t.co/X50arTqKF6
With his call for swifter justice, @realDonaldTrump is channeling the Queen of Hearts from #AliceInWonderland: Off with their heads! https://t.co/g37bSfRQA4
A day after New York, the president wants to repeal an immigration program. A day after Las Vegas, it was premature to talk about guns.
The threat is evolving from structured extremism to individual terrorism. There is a limit to what vetting and intelligence will reveal.
@realDonaldTrump The president presumes highly educated people don't become terrorists. Ted Kaczynski went to Harvard and Stephen Paddock to Cal Northridge.
This is brilliant. The @PressSec's beer colloquy confirms the Trump tax cut should mostly benefit the wealthy. https://t.co/ujzYTtTIGV
George Papadopoulos. https://t.co/JG7XEevrPn
Indictments? Let's talk about who pays what for beer. I might start a graduate lecture with a mind teaser, but not the @WhiteHouse briefing.
The @60Minutes interview with #Qatar's Emir underscores how the regional blockade is primarily about politics. Tiny Qatar is holing its own. https://t.co/280nvCZvLl
#NorthKorea must denuclearize. #Iran must go home. To the Trump administration, solving problems is just a matter of declarative sentences. https://t.co/ziDMUNzKiA
Corporations and states must fill the void on #climate policy in light of the Trump administration’s retrenchment. https://t.co/rsUOjz8Wnx
With #Nicaragua joining the #ParisAgreement, how does our anti-#ClimateChange alliance with #Syria keep America great? Well, it doesn't!
If @realDonaldTrump had responded presidentially when first asked about the #Niger attack, there would be no #GoldStar controversy.
Logistics is a core military function. @realDonaldTrump does not realize that driving trucks is something the military does all the time.
The President's description of #Iran's malign behavior is accurate, but messing with the #JCPOA increases the potential of a nuclear #Iran.
Critics of the #Iran deal relaunch their unicorn strategy, a futile search for a better deal that no other party is willing to negotiate.
We could envision a government of national unity in #America, but what would it actually do? That’s the challenge facing Fatah and Hamas.
The U.S. withdraws from #TPP, #Paris and now #UNESCO. How many times can we take our ball and go home before we cease being a player?
It's only a matter of time before @realDonaldTrump blames @BarackObama for America's loss in the #WorldCup2018 qualifier.
Great discussion @SquawkCNBC. A key virtue of the #Iran deal is it buys time to deal with more immediate security problems like #NorthKorea.
This underscores the primary purpose of Secretary Tillerson's press statement. He had an audience of one. https://t.co/2AtsRgXjIa
The Secretary of State calls a press conference to announce he is not working for a moron. And Nixon said he was not a crook.
I love #golf, but this is more bizarre than criticizing San Juan Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz while hanging out at his course in Bedminster. https://t.co/WM63fI6P2W

It's admittedly a low, low bar, but #NorthKorea's curiosity about @realDonaldTrump is actually good news. He is for them a known unknown. https://t.co/UzERdVEAyi
Women in #SaudiaArabia still confront a profound religious and cultural headwind. Still, this is, as @realDonaldTrump would say, huge. https://t.co/dyHhPZKH5T
Sorry to hear of @SenBobCorker's decision to retire. The Senate does not have a deep bench of true global thinkers. He will be missed.
Wrong to make this about the military. The military fights so its citizens, including #NFL players, can exercise their rights - all of them. https://t.co/NBX0o0E8Kl
Jaguar and Raven players gave @realDonaldTrump an important lesson in political physics. A crazy action elicits a more powerful reaction. https://t.co/wQCC8hitNr
The @realDonaldTrump UN speech is a lengthy review of the world's "deplorables," with only a passing reference to lifting up the world.
On the one hand, @realDonaldTrump salutes the work of the United Nations. On the other hand, he says America is paying too much for it.
There we have it, the new axis of evil -- #NorthKorea, #Iran and #Syria, the latter sliding up the list to replace #Iraq.
Notwithstanding @realDonaldTrump's assessment that the #Iran nuclear deal is an "embarrassment," few other countries see it that way.
Well, we are two-thirds the way to another axis of evil moment, as @realDonaldTrump singles out #North Korea and #Iran for criticism.
"Rocket man is on a suicide mission," @realDonaldTrump tells the United Nation. But denuclearization is unfortunately not its only option.
Trump doesn't recognize what America gets from its investment in the international system, the maintenance of a prosperous and secure world.
Trump, who does not believe in a global community, says the basis of international cooperation is shared interests, not shared values.
There are lessons, and differences. #Afghanistan is a real country. But there is no public support to deploy 500K more troops to save it. https://t.co/bpg1bAdh3D

After non-stop coverage of Hurricanes #Harvey and #Irma, cable news channels are back to scheduled programming, #NorthKorea and #Russia.
Great conversation @ToThePoint_KCRW on #NorthKorea with @DarylGKimball and @BarbaraDemick. Need a more cautious, deliberate approach.
If @RedSox operated like @USNavy, Manager John Farrell would be removed for not properly commanding his clubhouse. https://t.co/mnLyNR24Vu

Breaking: Putin thanks @realDonaldTrump for his support as #Russia suspends relations with the #CaliforniaRepublic. https://t.co/sqWin3jVOE
A persuasive argument by @LoebVernon about Harvey's lessons. Wonder if the #ClimateDenierInChief will read it. https://t.co/RSjxu7XXJ9 https://t.co/9FmmC0m6TH
A most sobering part of @POTUS' #Afghan speech was the admission that 16 years into the war, a political negotiation is nowhere in sight.
To succeed, we need to kill terrorists, grow a legal economy, and help develop an effective #Afghan government. That is nation-building. https://t.co/4QqgL9rLeg
What to listen for in @POTUS #Afghanistan speech: a path to negotiations, strategy on #Pakistan, what more troops will do, and for how long.
While @realDonaldTrump focuses on personal politics and equivocates, the Joint Chiefs see the bigger picture and display true leadership. https://t.co/N3bsNfL9Nb
Be careful what you wish for. Trump did turn a corner. He went backwards, roughly six decades. https://t.co/CnqOBTHWKx
Is there no one in the White House who understands that, if David Duke is applauding, this is bad for the country and for the presidency? https://t.co/UnhQBHAv9r
Loose talk about military options by @realDonaldTrump allowed #Venezuela's @NicolasMaduro to divert attention away from problems he created.
Let's recap. @realDonaldTrump baits #NorthKorea without a strategy but Sebastian Gorka thinks Rex Tillerson @StateDept is out of his depth?
Did fire and fury shift our red line to just a clear threat to U.S. territory? If so, a #NorthKorean missile launch at Guam would cross it.
Discussed whether there is a viable strategy behind @realDonaldTrump's "fire and fury" comments on #NorthKorea @marcowerman @pritheworld.
Having listened to many calls between @POTUS and world leaders, it is stunning to see the national interest cast in such personal terms. https://t.co/Hmrkc3X0BH
Not only does he use a signing statement to brag about his company, but @realDonaldTrump can't spell either: "executive branchs..." Really? https://t.co/RuyUghNDb7
The historically short tenures of several @WhiteHouse officials gives new meaning to a @realDonaldTrump signature narrative: #DriveThemOut!
The Trump administration continues to set records for historically short tenures: Flynn, #Spicey and now #TheMooch. We hardly knew ye. https://t.co/PRvqUYXWhY
Putin wields a disproportionate hammer on the American presence in #Russia and @StateDept still hopes for better relations? #RealityCheck
.@NYTimesCohen is right. @StateDept is in decline, but U.S. foreign policy has been militarizing for 35 years. https://t.co/cMo4oI5PKQ
Great respect for General John Kelly. But he admitted @AspenSecurity being uncomfortable with politics. This will be a baptism under fire.
#NorthKorea is now a partial nuclear power, a fact the U.S. can't accept. China proposes new talks, but there is no basis to sustain them.
Regardless of the motives of #Pakistan's Supreme Court, the country now has a huge opportunity to actually strengthen civilian governance.
Hopefully @Scaramucci will learn that backgrounding journalists about what happens in the people's house is vital. It's called transparency. https://t.co/M3si8ioKI0
Forcing qualified soldiers out of the military based on a political agenda and not based on performance is costly and disruptive. https://t.co/cA2SH7jkdG
I understand the thrill of a visit by @POTUS, but why in the world would the @boyscouts allow themselves to become this politicized?
NSA Director ADM Mike Rogers @AspenSecurity: Must become more agile to stay in front of rapid tech change, particularly regarding patches.
DNI Dan Coats @AspenSecurity: KimJongUn is an unusual leader, but is not crazy. He has internalized value of nukes for regime survival.
Here at @AspenSecurity, listening to a remarkably cogent bipartisan conversation about national security issues among four House members.
Congressman @MacThornberry @AspenSecurity: There should be an updated authorization for the use of force for ongoing military operations.
Congressman @MacThornberry @AspenSecurity: Trump is different. Statements are not as carefully weighed as in the past; not always policy.
Congressman @AdamSchiffCA @AspenSecurity: Must look at Russian interference in terms of contest between authoritarianism and democracy.
Jim Clapper @AspenSecurity: Presidential tweeting opens up potential counterintelligence vulnerability.
Intel vets Jim Clapper and John Brennan @AspenSecurity: Russia has done nothing to justify resumed access to closed diplomatic facilities.
CIA DIrector John Brennan @AspenSecurity: Greatest threat to U.S. is lack of preparedness for impact of automation on population writ large.
Former DNI Jim Clapper @AspenSecurity: North Korea not yet an existential threat, but given paranoia will not give up nuclear capability.
Robin Raphel @AspenSecurity: Pakistan won't give up proxies until Afghanistan stabilizes, even as their proxies destabilize the country.
The idea that there are parallels between Obama and Trump in terms of treatment of the press is utter nonsense. https://t.co/ZldNqqu4Pm
Kudos to Ambassador @hmohib, responding to the idea of privatizing America's longest war. "Contractors don't win wars." @AspenSecurity
Tony Blinken @AspenSecurity: The #Iran deal falls short of the ideal. The actual deal is what could be achieved. It's still a good deal.
Sean Spicer resigns as @PressSec, assumes position as the happiest man in Washington, D.C.
Mike Hayden @AspenSecurity: North Korea is a wicked problem; U.S. may have to accept a basic DPRK nuclear capability in return for limits.
Mike Hayden @AspenSecurity: The DNC hack was classic state espionage. The release of the information was a covert influence campaign.
Mike Chertoff @AspenSecurity: Three dimensions to #Russia issue, probe of voting machines, hack of party database and influence campaign.
Mike Hayden @AspenSecurity: Russia is not resurgent, but is a revanchist power, and willing to take on more risk to achieve objectives.
Amazing that 16 years into the war on terror, we are still debating interrogation and detention issues and the role of #GTMO @AspenSecurity
CIA Director Pompeo @AspenSecurity criticized "letting Russia" into the CW negotiations. This ignores Russia's prominent role in the UN.
When asked about Trump's positive comments about WikiLeaks, @CIA Director Pompeo responded, "I don't like WikiLeaks."
CIA Director Pompeo @AspenSecurity: Non-state actors such as WikiLeaks are like "free range chickens" working against the United States.
CIA Director Pompeo @AspenSecurity: #KimJongUn is rational enough to understand his primary mission, staying in power.
CIA Director Pompeo @AspenSecurity: #NorthKorea got a lot of outside help as they  accelerated up the nuclear/missile learning curve.
CIA Director Pompeo @AspenSecurity: My duty to work with the #Russians if they have CT information that can help us.
Julia Ioffe @AspenSecurity: Whatever system replaces Putinism will be more of the same, and will look a lot like what exists now.
Julia Ioffe @AspenSecurity: Not long ago, #Russia had no understanding of U.S. politics. They got smart quickly about its nuts and bolts.
Evelyn Farkas @AspenSecurity: Given Russia's election cycle, Moscow feels there is a year to establish better relations with the U.S.
Julia Ioffe @AspenSecurity: Russian officials see Trump as Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians, preventing better relations.
Agree. The Kurds will get a vote as well, as early as this year. https://t.co/1xRUYZPeGZ
Robin Wright @AspenSecurity: Each generation of militants rise in half the time, more militant than the last. Little hope in #Sunni world.
Iraqi Ambassador Yasseen @AspenSecurity: #ISIS 2.0 will look a lot like al Qaeda.
Peter Bergen @AspenSecurity: We will see a son and grandson of the #Islamic State, given the unresolved root causes that generated it.
Robin Wright @AspenSec: Future of Mosul will determine the future of #Iraq, critical need to rebuild city institutions and social fabric.
Andrew Tabler @AspenSecurity: War decimated military recruitment in #Syria. Iranian-backed militias filled the void, but are destabilizing.
Stu Jones @StateDept @AspenSecurity: Of the most influential players in #Syria, Russia is the only one the U.S. can negotiate with.
Andrew Tabler @AspenSecurity: The nature of the Syrian regime has changed due to the war. Assad will be difficult to deal with.
Jane Harman @AspenSecurity: The Trump administration was right to defend the red line in #Syria, but still lacks a broader strategy.
White House Advisor Tom Bossert @AspenSecurity describes the Russian election influence campaign as "acting badly on the Internet."
White House CT Advisor Tom Bossert @AspenSecurity: A lot of tactical wins over 15 years, but facing a spreading terrorist challenge.
Will French President Macron implausibly become Europe's Trump whisperer? My take on today's meeting @SquawkCNBC. https://t.co/8pPV2T05Dr
The we said-they said account of the Trump-Putin hacking discussion is not great, not awful, but will the next @POTUS tweet hold that line? https://t.co/3PNjmL9xGi
Trump likes good chemistry, but a bad meeting with #Putin is his best outcome, resetting political perceptions of his #Russia problem.
For all the anticipation, Trump and Putin won't turn the tide in one meeting. On key issues, the U.S. and Russia don't agree on much.
A critical question for @realDonaldTrump at the #G20Summit is whether he converts this tweet into a concrete U.S. foreign policy objective. https://t.co/EiwnJaa2b4
While all eyes are on the Trump-Putin meeting at the #G20Summit, @POTUS's interaction with China's President Xi will be far more important. https://t.co/RcNHM1BmmN
This is good advice, but @realDonaldTrump will likely highlight the good chemistry in the meeting, violating @mcfaul's first recommendation. https://t.co/Fbz1eoJx2W
The clearest sign yet we are deploying more troops to #Afghanistan without a political strategy to support them. https://t.co/jCJFTHoIXB
The U.S. strategy in #Afghanistan, playing for time, requires more pressure on #Pakistan. My take @bbcnews. https://t.co/qQhqVJ60uT
So, @realDonaldTrump seems surprised he could not solve the #NorthKorea problem in just five months. Who knew the world was so complex! https://t.co/Cnfjz6ZAmW
I guess @realDonaldTrump's foreign policy is "selective lecturing." The Gulf (but not Qatar) gets a pass. Europe and our neighbors don't.
Better late than never, President Trump recommits the United States to NATO Article 5.
@washingtonpost President Iohannes of #Romania would love to talk about the dangers posed by #Russia. President Trump, I'm guessing, not so much.
@washingtonpost The President welcomes his NATO counterpart from #Romania to the White House and then launches into a diatribe about #Qatar. Truly bizarre.
Ignore @POTUS tweets, says @KellyannePolls. Sounds like the Wizard of Oz: Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Similar hairstyle. https://t.co/r85QeXGRmx
Oh Mr. President, the world is already laughing at us. The #Paris withdrawal leaves #China as the leading defender of the global order.
Trump's #ParisClimateDeal withdrawal reinforces the link between American domestic politics and foreign policy. I wrote a book about it. https://t.co/PicYdtmRyA
The math behind the #ParisAccord is 193 countries for and four against, so why would @realDonaldTrump believe a better deal is available?
Since only #Russia supports withdrawal from the #ParisAccord, there is no plausible argument this advances American global leadership.
Notwithstanding @realDonaldTrump's #MAGA narrative, withdrawing from the #parisclimateagreement will devastate American global leadership.
Talk about alternative facts! The #Erdogan government complains to @usembassyankara about "security lapses" during the recent DC visit. https://t.co/hIkc7JWrFE
Are we seeing signs of a White House learning curve? After all, @realDonaldTrump joins a sword dance and suffers no self-inflicted wounds. https://t.co/dRMPlJJuC6
The administration, said @nytdavidbrooks @pbsnewshour, is imploding before it is fully staffed. Legal troubles aside, how does Trump govern?
Looking forward to talking about leaks on @ToThePoint_KCRW. @realDonaldTrump is hardly the first president to complain about them.
Trump's bleats about historically unfair treatment and witch hunts reveal how little he actually knows about American political history.
Just finished @JEPomfret's The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom, a great history of the vital yet complex U.S.-China relationship.
Trump's first 100 days were about political chaos. His next 100 days will be dominated by institutional conflict. The swamp strikes back.
Russia offers to give Congress its Trump-Lavrov meeting summary. #Putin, aka Mr. Transparency, is having way too much fun with this chaos.
I agree completely with @CharlesKrautham analysis of @realDonaldTrump's firing of #JamesComey and its implications. https://t.co/oQPV9MedGi
The @FBI Russia probe was an awkward political problem for @realDonaldTrump. Comey's mistimed firing turns it into a full-blown crisis.
It appears that #Macron will win the election in #France, reinforcing the firebreak against right-wing populism that the Dutch began.
What's stunning is not @realDonaldTrump's willingness to negotiate with #NorthKorea, but that he would be "honored" to meet Kim Jong Un.
My take on the strategic and diplomatic incoherence of the @realDonaldTrump administration in its first 100 days. https://t.co/pReZe0dm6R
Gen John Kelly rightly sees @DHSgov as vital to national security but the Trump White House wants to downsize such non-defense agencies.
General John Kelly @DHSgov spoke for an hour long at #GWU about the state of homeland security and never mentioned the great, great wall.
#Turkey over 40 years has evolved from a limited if secular democracy dominated by the military to one-man rule with a democratic veneer.
It's hard to argue that #Turkey is better off with a revised system of government if one man, #Erdogan, remains in power for 25 years.
@TVietor08 @cjchivers All of the above. It suggests we're not looking for an exit strategy. That said, we still have to be tougher on Pakistan.
Obama tried to end the war in #Afghanistan but couldn't. Trump is intensifying it but won't succeed without getting tougher on #Pakistan.
Feels like the Cold War when Soviet leaders were left out of the May Day parade picture, leaving Kremlinologists to interpret the meaning. https://t.co/2WYEHutqxR
How to turn an everyday problem into a major corporate crisis? That's @united, a textbook case in what not to do. https://t.co/SKJ7Z83iRS
A true fact. https://t.co/X1dnCVVaYo
The NSC reshuffle is a win for H.R. McMaster, but having #SteveBannon inside the Situation Room kept a friend/rival close and constrained.
Despite @POTUS' criticism of Obama's #Syria response in 2013, he faces the same vexing policy constraints in 2017. I wrote a book about it. https://t.co/WdVKfjwjor
Interesting dichotomy: @POTUS says the U.S. will resolve #NorthKorea one way or another. Rex Tillerson doesn't want to talk about it.
Ironically, @POTUS order on coal is a net job loser. Coal is a dying industry but it can retard progress in the expanding green economy.
Amber Alert: There is a buck wandering around the swamp looking for somewhere to land. @POTUS response: Buck, what buck? How presidential.
Hmm, @POTUS says all states having problems with healthcare. Not Massachusetts, where a good system was enacted with bipartisan support.
Wait. Republicans were an opposition party when George W. Bush was in the White House? And haven't they controlled Congress for two years? https://t.co/mmrUrefUJn
To recap, @POTUS said who knew healthcare was so complex. @SpeakerRyan said who knew governing was so hard. Welcome to the real world.
Rest in peace Martin McGuinness. Despite Northern Ireland's complex politics, he was more focused on solving problems than scoring points.
Poor #Mexico. How long before @POTUS adds the theft of Brady's jerseys to his purported justification for the Great, Great Wall of Trump?
Hopefully not lost in the hearing politics is #NSA Director ADM Mike Roger's view that our electoral system is critical infrastructure.
Even with the politics, the House Intel Committee put a lot on the table regarding Russia's influence campaign that cannot be ignored.
I agree with @TGowdySC fully regarding the value of evidence. So how much evidence v. politics guided the Benghazi investigation?
Good Lord, @PressSec says nothing has changed based on FBI Director Comey testimony. Really? Total debunk of @POTUS tweets, literally!
Any way you look at it, #Russia's preference for Trump, the poor vetting of Flynn, and wiretapping tweets, this is a bad day for @POTUS.
Investigating the compromise of classified information is appropriate, but it's chilling for @TGowdySC to potentially implicate the media.
@nancyleeny @ColMorrisDavis @ColJackJacobs @MSNBC Nancy, both Jack and I said any use of force would involve tremendous loss of life.
@ColMorrisDavis @ColJackJacobs @MSNBC. Right back at you Morris.

As he damages America's interests with looney responses, @PressSec should understand @POTUS is not his only client. https://t.co/PHztD3F5wT
By the time appeals run their course, the administration should be able to complete its security review, mooting the ban's stated purpose.
It is amazing/disconcerting that @POTUS and @PressSec keep doing backflips into the wiretapping hole, never mind putting the shovel down.
Rex Tillerson, America’s Low-Energy Top Diplomat: the public diplomacy vacuum created by a muted @StateDept. https://t.co/LS9CJBPrLn
As a national security budget, Trump increases offense and defense but cuts prevention, the third leg of the stool. The result is unstable.
Trump's approach to national security mirrors his approach to health care: a sharp cut in preventive medicine. That's what @StateDept does.
The @POTUS budget bottom line: the world is a mess, but it's not America's job to fix it. And our beautiful wall will keep bad things away.
The Trump budget cuts @StateDept funding for climate change mitigation. Their thinking: problem doesn't exist, no need to help. Simple.
The Trump budget sharply reduces @StateDept funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. But as wars wind down, development needs actually go up.
Here in Washington, D.C., the snow better show up or @POTUS will start talking about fake weather, not just fake news.
In his budget proposal, @POTUS is betting - wrongly - that there is a greater threat at the Mexican border than at a commercial airport.
The EO signed yesterday drops the U.S. refugee target to 50,000, the lowest since the early 1980s. Yet the need today continues to expand.
Need to find $54B in budget offsets? The intel community can be downsized given @POTUS preference for @BreitbartNews and @foxandfriends.
Just when you think @POTUS has turned a corner and become presidential, he reverts back to conspiratorial form with his #TrumpTower claim.
Sad to hear of the passing of Rene Preval. Unlike his predecessors, he was able to retire as president of #Haiti and stay in the country.
Attorney General Sessions did the only thing he could under the circumstances, an unforced error largely of his own making.
Trump 1, McMaster 0. @POTUS repeats the term "radical Islamic terrorism" despite National Security Advisor's belief it is unhelpful.
No reference to how @POTUS will pay for the "Great, Great Wall."
Muted applause to @POTUS reference to decision to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
While @POTUS is right that he does not represent the world, calling the media enemies of the people is the wrong way to represent #America.
Appearing today on Washington Journal @cspan to discuss my book #RedLine and the tension between U.S. domestic politics and foreign policy. https://t.co/4i3bzgXuAU
Lt Gen Brent Scowcroft retired from active duty in 1975 to avoid any perceived conflict of interest as National Security Advisor. #McMaster
LTG H.R. #McMaster is an excellent choice. He is a true strategic thinker, a key attribute for a successful National Security Advisor.
Sign at a local bookstore: Building a bunker yet? Let us help you with your library.
Pleased to join @EliotACohen on @pritheworld today to discuss the Trump administration's turbulent start and prospects of a learning curve.
When @POTUS said today that no president has done what he has done in such a short time, he's right. It's why we've survived for 240 years.
If you are @POTUS, the leader of the free world, fixing the national "mess," where do you find time to collect all these grievances?
An hour into the press conference, we finally get an answer that sounds presidential, regarding immigration. But it didn't last long.
Just because the media headlines tomorrow will suggest that @POTUS was unhinged doesn't mean they're wrong. He's channeling Peter Finch.
If @POTUS has been overly scripted in recent appearances, he has been unleashed in assessing his first 30 days in office.
Can @POTUS be serious that his inheritance is "messier" than the dire circumstances that confronted @BarackObama in 2009? Not convincing.
Yesterday @PressSec said Flynn lost @POTUS trust. Today Trump says it's all about leaks to fake media. The gang that can't talk straight.
Distinguishing between the Canadian and Mexican pieces of #NAFTA helps @POTUS politically, but it is a trilateral trade agreement.
Canada and @JustinTrudeau reminds the United States and @POTUS that you can be both open and secure. Yes, it's common sense.
In his remarks with @JustinTrudeau, did @POTUS do a policy U-turn when he cited the value of hemispheric jobs? That would include #Mexico.
.@KellyannePolls says @POTUS makes things up, but he also hits home runs. What's the metric for that, success above deception? That's #SAD.
Great insight from @Arturo_Sarukhan regarding the rising tension in the U.S.-Mexico relationship. https://t.co/vcV9k5Q5ll via @BrookingsInst
No doubt Tom Brady is the #Deflategate winner. @NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's rebuilding strategy died with the Falcons. #rogerthat https://t.co/nEOolBhNCC
The best defense against terrorism is to refuse to be terrorized. The current @POTUS effort to stoke public fear undermines our strategy. https://t.co/m0P7dzm1Rj
The dumbing down of national security: We've gone from avoiding stupid stuff under @BarackObama to reveling in stupid stuff under @POTUS.
According to @POTUS, the U.S. stands by our allies. Of course, that doesn't mean that #Iraq's citizens can travel to the United States.
Does @POTUS not understand constitutional checks and balances? Attacking the legitimacy of the "so-called judge" undermines his presidency.
It appears @BarackObama asked @TurnbullMalcolm to "mentor" @POTUS. The lesson plan: Talk to Trump, head for the liquor cabinet. Repeat.
It appears @POTUS is simplifying his duties. Given the Trump treatment, no allied leader will call him, visit him or invite him anywhere.
Excellent analysis of the national security process challenges facing the Trump White House. https://t.co/QuU7egYnxY via @defenseone
The most unconventional @POTUS in modern history is already drawing parallels to the most controversial, Richard Nixon. #MondayNightMassacre
So @CIA is added as the Trump #NSC principal, but not his boss @ODNIgov? @POTUS is making it as he goes along, without any clear logic.
While diplomats can resign if unable to support @POTUS policy, a White House that ignores the concerns of its troops is headed for trouble.
Agree with the @StateDept dissent memo: We do not need to sacrifice our reputation as a nation nor alienate entire societies to stay safe.
PM @netanyahu's endorsement of a wall created political ripples at home, but it undoubtedly hit its intended target here, the @POTUS ego.
Given the global condemnation, how can @KellyannePolls say the Muslim ban is a "small price to pay" for U.S. security? The cost is huge!
.@PressSec cited Steve Bannon's "considerable" military experience to justify his NSC seat. So why reduce @GenDunford role with 5X more?
Senators McCain and Graham rightly criticize the Muslim ban, but it isn't "hasty." @POTUS said he would do this and we elected him anyway.
Right or wrong, Steve Bannon's inclusion in the NSC reflects the intersection of policy and politics, a premise of my new book #RedLine. https://t.co/EyVY33DkjJ
In one week, @POTUS uses the CIA Memorial Wall and Pentagon Hall of Heroes as backdrops to condemn the media and ban immigrants. Unreal.
What? @POTUS believes in torture but has given the Secretary of Defense the power to override him? I thought the rule of law did that.
Undersecretary Pat Kennedy was the "town manager" of @StateDept. He made it more cost effective, lots of impact for the diplomatic dollar.
In @ABCWorldNews interview, @POTUS suggests alternative fact that water boarding (allegedly) works, but not the fact it is illegal.
Alternative fact #1: Biggest Inaugural crowd ever! Alternative fact #2: Withdrawing from #TPP will enhance American leadership! Doubtful.
We've replaced "don't do stupid stuff" with "alternative facts" as the organizing principle of American policy. It sounds Putinesque.
The @PressSec called his first press briefing to argue about Inaugural numbers and a bust? It will be a long four years or short tenure.
Digesting the Trump inaugural speech, he pledges to return government to the people. But we the people are deeply divided about its role.
The new president deserves credit for a mercifully short inaugural address.
You will never be ignored again says the new president, unless of course you are @CNN and comparable traffickers of fake news.
If @realDonaldTrump threatens #Mexico over payment for his great wall, do we really want to replace American exceptionalism with extortion? https://t.co/6ip0dMmmLD
So thinking about politics, while border security is part of Trump's electoral mandate, no #Mexican president will agree to pay for it... https://t.co/BdWDAD8ATT
As I write in #RedLine, to understand foreign policy, one must take into account domestic politics. That's true of all nations... https://t.co/RvoyJ7xtsZ
The Bush administration reduced the #NSC staff in 2001 but reversed course after 9/11. Policy and politics will force #Trump to reconsider.
The @realDonaldTrump intent to cut the #NSC staff by two-thirds ignores how complex national security policy is. https://t.co/Bj94R3bXL9
OK, so Team Trump is disappointed in the preemptive leak of the report on #Russia's influence campaign which they preemptively disputed?
Senators and witnesses distinguished b/w Russian election interference (no doubt) and influence (can't say), a nuance Trump should adopt.
The #Senate on a bipartisan basis views #Russian interference with the election as an attack on America that merits a strong response.
Today's #Senate hearing on cyber and #Russian interference in the election was thoughtful and constructive, not normally Hill strong suits.
All for increasing @StateDept budget, but the incoming president's mandate is to save Damascus, Ohio, not #Syria. https://t.co/qBlBWAl0Tx
This week's big @realDonaldTrump revelation: As with the generals and the Islamic State, he knows more about hacking than @NSAGov.
Perhaps @realDonaldTrump is just confused about intelligence. It guides a president what to think about. It doesn't tell him what to do.
While @realDonaldTrump sees @Twitter as a means to make his presidency "exciting," most White Houses prefer routine wins to cliffhangers.
Weren't Republican candidates critical of military aircraft that were older than their crews? Air Force One would be over 30 when replaced.
Looking forward to talking with @frankelly08 about American foreign policy in light of the Trump election and his #Taiwan call.
Interesting. @realDonaldTrump woos #Russia, where shared interests are narrowing, and fires a shot at #China, where they are expanding.
Unpredictability got @realDonaldTrump elected, but his #Taiwan call shows how it can add major foreign policy risk without a clear reward.
President-elect @realDonaldTrump calls General Jim Mattis a modern day Patton. But no one envisioned Patton as a Secretary of War.
We live in a post-truth world, @stengel @StateDept tells @IgnatiusPost, a reality @realDonaldTrump seems to embrace. https://t.co/9tRJStgFw4
While #FidelCastro's death will reduce opposition to normal relations, I don't see @realDonaldTrump taking in a baseball game in Havana.
The death of #FidelCastro will reduce the intensity of political opposition to the ongoing diplomatic and economic opening with #Cuba.
Frank Gaffney's inclusion in the @realDonaldTrump transition signals the war with the Republican foreign policy establishment continues.
Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton have real world skills, but their black and white vision clashes with the grays of today's complex world.
How much of @realDonaldTrump's rhetoric regarding walls, deals and alliances will shape his actual foreign policy? Not all, but a lot.
The stunning Trump election reinforces the premise of my upcoming book, Red Line, the intersection of domestic politics and foreign policy. https://t.co/V6toAr65En
Can't say it better than #jonbonjovi in Philadelphia: Tomorrow when Americans vote, the world will be watching. #iamwithhillary
Honored to share a stage today with former Mexican president @FelipeCalderon, discussing with @CoreNetGlobal the forces shaping our world.
Last debate it was Miss Universe. This time around it's Sid Blumenthal.
This is the best moderated debate in recent history. Martha and Anderson have done a great job.
We're back to the unpredictable Trump policy that will not be discussed in public. ISIS is not abandoning Mosul.
Until we find ourselves in the middle of a debate, we forget how long two minutes can be!
We're into policy and Trump has little to say except that the existing system is a total disaster.
Trump has some momentum and just gave it back with the one on three comment.
Trump is throwing spaghetti in every direction possible and see if anything sticks.
Hillary Clinton turning the tables on the Republicans and claiming the high ground in a values election.
Hillary Clinton needs to be crisp tonight. Leave room for Trump to be Trump.
Peace through strength? Donald Trump's election will itself impel #Putin to stop his aggression and #KimJongUn to give up nuclear weapons.
Gov. Pence calls for strikes against #Assad to halt the siege of Aleppo, a much deeper role in #Syria than any prior campaign proposal.
An effective @timkaine critique of @realDonaldTrump foreign policy, including the personal Mount Rushmore of world autocrats.
Sure. When?
The question was whether Donald Trump could keep it together for 90 minutes. He went off the rails towards the end.
To be president, you have to have STAMINA if you are going to negotiate good (not bad) deals that allow you to keep the oil.
China would love to have total power over North Korea. Instead, they confront a vexing major power/client state dilemma.
Hmm, after a two minute rant against the mainstream media over Iraq, Trump says he has the perfect temperament to be president.
Say what? A U.S. government agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has endorsed Trump for President? Don't think so.
OMG! The king of the birther movement just accused Hillary Clinton of disrespecting President Obama? That is rich!
President Trump will restore torture and stop and frisk. Never mind how those biased judges rule. He'll replace them, and the generals.
Just saying law and order, like saying radical Islamic terrorism, is the key to solving the problem. Oh, and better judges.
It appears @realDonaldTrump's beautiful wall will work two ways -- keeping immigrants out and jobs and capital in. #debatenight
China is the best ever, says @realDonaldTrump? It has lifted a historic number of people above poverty, but has major structural problems.
For decades, the U.S. helped build global alliances. Now @realDonaldTrump say allies mustl pay to rebuild ours. Leading with a tin cup?
In Iowa, @realDonaldTrump says "I will keep your communities safe." He doesn't mention local law enforcement. He's going to be pretty busy.
A salute to #Albania for its willingness to resettle 2,000 refugees from Iraq's #CampLiberty. One of Europe's smallest nation stands tall.
The U.S. under @realDonaldTrump will build a state of the art missile defense system. (And we'll get #NorthKorea to pay for it.)
Listening to his new BFF double down on everything, #Mexican President Peña Nieto proves yet again that no good deed goes unpunished.
If the high-level meeting in #Mexico was @realDonaldTrump's moment to look presidential, he seems to have gotten over it pretty quickly.
Curious that @realDonaldTrump supports military commissions and ignores the strong record of terrorist convictions in civilian courts.
It's unclear how #Russia makes the cut as a @realDonaldTrump ally against #ISIS. Putin opposes American exceptionalism and gay rights.
Jean Lee @WilsonCentre @AspenSecurity: Relations between #China and #NorthKorea are not close, but it is an important buffer for Beijing.
Katharine Moon @BrookingsInst @AspenSecurity: Kim Jong-Un has consolidated his power in #NorthKorea faster than his father and grandfather.
Powerful line in the @HillaryClinton video. She is a work horse, not a show horse. We all saw that day in and day out @StateDept.
Cliff Kupchan @EurasiaGroup @AspenSecurity: JCPOA is a reasonable bet on the evolution of #Iran. If wrong, U.S. well positioned to respond.
Shibley Telhami @AspenSecurity : The divide between Democrats and Republicans over Islam is wider than any other issue including abortion.
Shibley Telhami @AspenSecurity : The Iraq war unleashed a variety of forces that have been broadly destabilizing across the Middle East.
Jim Clapper @ODNIgov @AspenSecurity: Al Nusra Front announced split with al Qaeda is a PR move. Remains to be seen if the divorce is real.
Jim Clapper @ODNIgov @AspenSecurity: Reasonable to consider Putin as engaged in a low level asymmetric war with the U.S. Throwback to tsars.
Jim Clapper @ODNIgov @AspenSecurity: Putin sees U.S. conspiracies in political developments in #Russia and could be inclined to retaliate.
John Carlin @TheJusticeDept @AspenSecurity hints it will bring a public case against #Russia if attribution is established in the DNC hack.
Cyril Sartor @CIA @AspenSecurity: The key to fighting terrorism in #Africa is better governance, addressing socio-economic weaknesses.
Cyril Sartor @CIA @AspenSecurity: Terrorist ideologies are a foreign import to #Africa, thrive because they  have co-opted local grievances.
Heather Conley @CSIS @AspenSecurity: Putin is recreating #Russia's national identity by generating and exploiting international crises.
Heather Conley @CSIS @AspenSecurity: The Black Sea area is becoming more dynamic and vulnerable, requires a more significant @NATO response.
Elissa Slotkin @AspenSecurity: Russia is using active propaganda measures to sow dissent and undermine global perceptions of U.S. democracy.
Gen Joe Votel @CENTCOM @AspenSecurity: After defeat of the caliphate, there will be another version of #ISIS. This is a protracted conflict.
General Joe Votel @CENTCOM @AspenSecurity: Al Nusra Front can try to rebrand itself, but it is still guided by the core al Qaeda ideology.
Great question by Richard Engel @NBCNews @AspenSecurity: Who will get to Raqqa first, the Russians or Americans? General Votel: We'll see.
General Joe Votel @CENTCOM @AspenSecurity: We can 't be in a rush to go to Mosul. Must get political and humanitarian plans in place first.
DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson @AspenSecurity: It is far easier for the Islamic State to inspire a western attack than export one from #Syria.
DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson @AspenSecurity: In this environment, you can kill an enemy but not defeat them. Must play defense and offense.
General Flynn, meet Pat Buchanan, the last guy to leave the non-committed watching the first night of an RNC convention this wide-eyed.
LtGen Michael Flynn criticizes senseless political hyperbole. You mean like commending Saddam Hussein for his counterterrorism practices?
LtGen Michael Flynn claims US leadership is in jeopardy, as he endorsed the guy who thinks NATO is old and allies should defend themselves.
LtGen Michael Flynn declared that war is not about bathrooms. But it is the conservative movement that declared war on bathrooms, no?
Reports of an attempted military coup in #Turkey, politically divided, yet much stronger economically than 1980 when this last occurred.
The #FranceAttack is simple terrorism, an ordinary vehicle used as a weapon against civil society. What we control is how we respond.
Amazing chance to speak to 100,000 people in #Paris and thank #Albania for taking in refugees from Camp Liberty. https://t.co/0ACPGqKnHH
Joining the #FreeIran rally with the Iranian opposition in #Paris, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al-Saud of the #Saudi Royal Family. A big deal.
An extraordinary political rally underway in #Paris, 100,000 people gathered in support of a #FreeIran, joined by the #Syrian opposition.
The Soviet Union gave its soldiers a choice of where to retire. Many chose #Crimea and #Transnistria, one reason #Putin is values them.
The New Strategy Center in #Romania has released an interesting paper encouraging @NATO to increase deterrence in the Black Sea region.
In #Romania, the big winner after #Brexit is viewed as #Russia. There is concern that the pressure on Moscow over #Ukraine will diminish.
As someone who has golfed in #Ireland and #NorthernIreland, with #Brexit, at some future point we'll see restoration of border controls.
Contrary to the old saw, politics do not stop at the water's edge. #Brexit just transformed the global financial and security landscape.
Americans should buckle their seat belts. #Brexit will sort itself out over time but there will be considerable turbulence along the way.
I'm coming. I didn't think there was still an open question. Look forward to it.
If Trump believes it was a mistake to admit the Mateens over 30 years ago, his solution to #Orlando is in effect a permanent ban. #NotUS.
Great line @HillaryClinton: It's better in the 21st Century to build bridges rather than walls. Walls will take America backwards.
Hillary Clinton's speech was part foreign policy and part politics. She all but did a reprise of the LBJ Daisy ad against Barry Goldwater.
Hillary Clinton's speech was one that Republican candidates should have given many months ago. Mitt Romney tried, but it came too late.
OK America. It hinges on your common sense. It's too dangerous to place Trump's thin skin or Twitter account anywhere near the button.
A Trump presidency would embolden #ISIS says @HillaryClinton. This is about reality, not reality TV.
Great line by @HillaryClinton: No one loses a life when you blow up a golf course deal, as opposed to blowing up the #Iran deal.
Interesting that Hillary Clinton placed #NorthKorea near the top of her speech. Pyongyang has (sort of) endorsed Trump.
Good theme by Hillary Clinton: Trump doesn't know the world or #America.
Hillary Clinton says the choice is between a fearful and confident #America, then drops the hammer on her presumptive opponent.
Can't remember a foreign policy speech so uninterrupted by applause. Telling the Republican establishment their ideas are dated won't help.
.@realDonaldTrump foreign policy: We must contain the spread of radical Islam. So his highest priority is rebuilding nuclear forces.
.@realDonaldTrump foreign policy: America will be reliable again, but we have to be unpredictable.
.@realDonaldTrump foreign policy: America will be a friend again, but only if you appreciate what we do for you and pay your fair share.
Will talk @realDonaldTrump foreign policy with @JDBmsnbc this morning. Can he outline a strategic framework that his party will support?
NATO is costly, but as @realDonaldTrump should appreciate, things with real value, such as legitimacy and interoperability, aren't cheap.
Republican frontrunners say we must restore American leadership. But ripping up the Iran deal and leaving NATO would surely undermine it.
Ted Cruz says that the world doesn't understand what we're doing, so let's rip up the #Iran agreement. That'll clarify things. #GOPDebate
Rubio says he believes in #climatechange - that's progress - but he is basically saying there is nothing we should do about it. #GOPDebate
Suspending relations again with #Cuba may yield favor in #Florida, but will destroy goodwill with the rest of the hemisphere. #GOPDebate
Not only will #Mexico pay for the wall, but Trump seemed to suggest that #SaudiArabia will fund Social Security. #GOPDebate
#GOPDebate economic bumper sticker: Government doesn't create jobs but it destroys them. It forced left wing plant owners to automate.
Donald Trump is wrong about the military. No commander will follow an illegal order. It's about the law, not the commander in chief.
Obama is right: Let me end #GTMO and not pass to next #POTUS. But Congress won't give him in his last year what they denied him for seven.
President Bush once said, elections matter. President Obama has constructively engaged #Iran just as he said he would in the 2007 debate.
If anyone receives a confidential email from P.J. Crowley, please delete it. I have started the day with a computer hack. Sorry.
Sad to hear of the passing of @RedSox third baseman Frank Malzone. Great old school player, Army veteran and very kind man. Rest in peace.
Rand Paul nailed the connections among regime change, chaos and the rise of extremism.
Rubio and Trump are both right. The world is better off without these dictators; and we could have spent the money more wisely.
Libya is a mess, but it did hold a free and fair election first. ISIS is in Libya, but is not governing the country.
Generals Petraeus and McCrystal were gifted soldiers but both made critical mistakes that compromised their ability to continue to serve.
John Kasich talked about a massive ground force, but only recommended 10,000 U.S. troops. If you want to do that, will have to be more.
Ted Cruz suggested a Gulf War-like air campaign against ISIS, but it involved attacking a major conventional army. Way more targets.
The first time in presidential debate history that a candidate talked about the government using the wrong algorithm.
The contrast between Chris Christie and Ben Carson is striking. One is leading the conversation and the other is trailing behind.
The civil war in #Syria started in part because of a drought. The U.S. government can combat terrorism and climate change at the same time.
If the #SanBernardino perpetrators discussed an attack in 2012, before #ISIS emerged, it shows how long the radicalization fuse can be.
Rest in peace Barry #Schweid @AP, a dogged yet fair diplomatic reporter who helped us better understand this complex world we live in.
Rest in peace Sandy Berger. He had an astute sense of what America could do and needed to do during an era of profound global change.
New description of #MiddleEast challenge by @JohnKerry @CarnegieEndow: degrade Daesh more rapidly, defeat it by ending the war in #Syria.
The Islamic State wants to turn regional clocks back a millennium, suggests @JohnKerry @StateDept @CarnegieEndow.
Says @JohnKerry @CarnegieEndow: Situation in #Israel and #Palestinian territories is not sustainable. Regional politics suggest otherwise.
.@JohnKerry @StateDept just used the words #MiddleEast and optimism in the same sentence. We haven't heard that lately. @CarnegieEndow
Will be on @CNN tonight talking about #BengahziHearing. Reminds me of the saying: Whatever is worth doing is worth overdoing.
Is there a point where we have to treat the #BengahziHearing as an enhanced interrogation technique? Not yielding additional intelligence.
Looking forward to joining @NewsHour tonight to discuss the #Russia and the crisis in #Syria. @IPDGC
Putin and Obama disagree on definition of legitimacy, the former fighting terrorism, the latter not attacking one's own people. #UNGA2015
Syrian forces are valiantly fighting ISIS and other terrorist organizations suggests Putin. Need an international coalition to defeat them.
Putin takes a swipe at American exceptionalism, suggesting that identification with regional change brings chaos and radicalism. #UNGA2015
Putin's Yalta reference is interesting, reminding that major powers can sit together and work everything out through consensus. #UNGA2015
King Abdullah of Jordan just reinforced that when it comes to #UNGA speeches, less is much more powerful. Seven points, then off stage.
#Syrian refugees account for 20 percent of Jordan's population. The international community must do more to offset that burden. #UNGA2015
King Abdullah of #Jordan says violent extremists are outlaws. They are interested in power. They use religion as a mask. #UNGA2015
King Abdullah of #Jordan calls the struggle against violent extremism a third world war and must be waged with the same intensity. #UNGA2015
A key phrase in the Obama speech is "managed transition" in #Syria, recognizing Assad is a fact on the ground for now, but not for life.
It is telling that having used past #UNGA addresses to encourage Middle East peace and Palestinian statehood, they were not even mentioned.
Realism requires compromise in #Syria, but also a transition in #Syria. No going back to the pre-war status quo, Obama tells #UNGA2015.
A great needle to #Iran as it begins to open up to the rest of the world. Shouting to America, suggests Obama, does not create jobs.
Obama seems to be engaged in a debate at #UNGA2015 with Russia, China, Iran and the 2016 Republican presidential aspirants.
Obama calls dictatorships inherently unstable. They cannot imprison ideas or turn lies into truth. #UNGA2015
#Obama tells #UNGA2015 we cannot go back to the old ways of coercion in a world that is increasingly integrated. Must cooperate to succeed.
Obama challenges Russian President Putin directly for his stated belief that support for #Assad is the only solution in #Syria. #UNGA2015
Obama urges imposing costs on those who choose conflict over cooperation, which the U.S. has found difficult in #Ukraine and #Syria. #UNGA
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says five countries hold the key to #Syria: Russia, United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran. #UNGA
The inclusive tone of the interfaith service at Ground Zero is so different from the divisive rhetoric of the campaign trail. #PopeinNYC
German Chancellor Merkel decided Hungarian PM Orban should not be Europe's leading voice on immigration. So why is America's Donald Trump?
Willkommen! #Germany is advancing its #publicdiplomacy by opening up to #Syrian refugees. Where are the comparable scenes in #America?
Interesting name in the @warriororg ad @NYTimes advocating a no vote on the #IranNuclearDeal: Richard Secord. New twist on Iran Contra.
Really? Republicans called @BarackObama Neville Chamberlain but are offended when he compared nuclear deal critics to #Iranian hardliners?
If Mullah Omar has been dead for two years without Washington, Kabul or Islamabad knowing it, this would be a major intelligence failure.
Kudos to @peterwsinger &amp; @august_cole for #GhostFleet, a fantastic story of geopolitics &amp; the promise and dangers inherent in technology.
Counterterrorism panel @AspenSecurity: Four former national security leaders wonder why someone on the no fly list can legally buy a gun.
General Mike Hayden @AspenSecurity: Iraq, Syria Libya and Lebanon are "gone." They will not be the same as they were before the crisis.
#DNI Clapper @AspenSecurity: The Islamic State holds less territory than last June, but success has generated new sub-Caliphates elsewhere.
#DNI Clapper @AspenSecurity: Shia militias have been more effective than the #Iraqi Security Forces.
@JessicaEStern @aspensecurity What #DNI was saying is that IC will increase understanding of #Iran through the deal as it supports it.
#DNI Clapper @AspenSecurity: #Putin is a throwback to the time of the czars. Russia will try to keep #Ukraine in its orbit.
#DNI Clapper @AspenSecurity: #Iran will spend most of its money on its domestic economy. Quds Force and the IRGC are already being funded.
#DNI Clapper @AspenSecurity: The Iran deal is good for the intelligence community given its intrusive inspection requirements.
Doug Lute, @USNATO Ambassador, @AspenSecurity: Not the Cold War, but NATO has gone back to basics, mutual defense among 28 allies.
Russian Ambassador Kislyak @AspenSecurity: Moscow sees the increased NATO military activity close to Russian border. We can read messages.
CIA Deputy Director David Cohen @AspenSecurity: Greater unrest and complexity in a digital world is making the intel challenge harder.
SOCOM's Gen Joe Votel @AspenSecurity: To understand the Middle East conflict, look at Colombia and its 50-year struggle with the FARC.
Iraqi Ambassador Lukman Faily @AspenSecurity: The U.S. can help facilitate counter messaging against ISIL but the messenger must be Islamic.
Special Coordinator General John Allen @AspenSecurity: The Islamic State is losing. It has growing morale problems within its force.
DoJ's John Carlin @AspenSecurity: 40 percent of those targeted for recruitment on line by the Islamic State are 21 years old or younger.
Former USD Mike Vickers @AspenSecurity: The Islamic State's best recruiting tool is success, its ability to form and sustain a Caliphate.
Former USD Mike Vickers @AspenSecurity: The Syrian civil war gave Al Qaeda a new lease on life and space to evolve into the Islamic State.
French Ambassador @GerardAraud @AspenSecurity: America sees #Iraq as the key focus regarding the Islamic State. For France it is #Syria.
French Ambassador @GerardAraud @AspenSecurity: The conflict with Russia over Ukraine is not a new Cold War. It's not global or existential.
DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson @AspenSecurity: The high cost to house a low number of detainees at #Guantanamo is a strong argument for closure.
#DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson @AspenSecurity: The Islamic State is spending more time so far sending messages across borders than operatives.
#DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson @AspenSecurity: Terrorist threat evolving from directed attacks from overseas to inspired attacks at home.
Despite sanctions, Iran figured out how to build a nuclear bomb. The #IranDeal provides time to convince Tehran it doesn't need one.
The #IranDeal provides a decade to try to develop a different relationship between #Iran and the rest of the world. It's worth a chance.
Anticipating a nuclear deal with #Iran, falling oil prices also impact #Russia; in theory, less money for mischief in Putin's cookie jar.
The late Prince Saud's tenure as Saudi FM began just after the oil embargo. From there he helped build an enduring friendship with the U.S.
U.S. Women, up 4-1, have to win the first ten minutes of the second half. If they do, it's hard to see how Japan comes back. #USAvJPN
The small scale extremist attack in #Lyon shows how far the threat has moved from al Qaeda's original preference for the spectacular event.
In #Ireland, people are touched by the response to the tragedy in #California. People are baffled by what happened in #SouthCarolina.
.@novaculus @harrisfaulkner Four years have shown #Syria is not #Libya. All for deposing Assad. It will take 200K troops and $3 trillion.
@philabouzeid Great interview and wonderful visit to Beirut.
Lebanon is intensely focused on #Iran. It understands the value of a nuclear dal, but worries what the local and regional impact will be.
There are 1.5M Syrian refugees in #Lebanon, adding 30 percent to its normal population. Despite added burden, Lebanon remains resilient.
Great discussions in Beirut hosted by "think lab" #MaisonDuFutur and former President Amine Gemayel about #Lebanon and the Middle East.
The visit of @JohnKerry to #Somalia, the first secretary @StateDept to do so, is a remarkable sign of progress in that war-torn country.
Putin could be in office through 2024. What is needed says @carlbildt @CSIS is strategic determination; strategic patience is not enough.
Listening to @carlbildt @CSIS. #Putin has turned #Russia into an unpredictable country, which poses a danger in itself.
In the house at the White House Correspondents' Dinner is @RedSox owner John Henry. Go Sox!
Given the agreement with Congress, Republicans won't scuttle a deal with #Iran. They will run against it in 2016. http://t.co/XgxNA43FrI
Great discussion with @tombrokaw and @politicoroger @UChiPolitics on the evolution of media and politics. http://t.co/QO5iYwgk9A
Hmm, @GovWalker says he will reverse the #Iran deal no matter what. Last time we went that rogue, it didn't go well. http://t.co/NmBhRbjGy1
The @DefenseOne news @RumsfeldOffice is open to a third term as @SECDEFUS under @tedcruz will not make his path to the White House easier.
With the restoration of U.S. military aid, #Egypt's not so inclusive political transition has now come full circle. http://t.co/HwDzSwTumb
Great @ForeignAffairs article on #AlQaeda documents. #BinLaden accepted #climatechange, giving deniers new fodder. http://t.co/utlGNcfwIk
.@m4zdaman @politicoroger The Houthis took dead aim at Obama's #Yemen model. We knew it was fragile and now we'll find out how durable.
.@politicoroger Some balls are kept in play while others are kicked down the road, intercepted and dropped. The key is how often you score.
With the #Saudi response in #Yemen, it's hard to remember a time where we had this many balls in the air in the #MiddleEast at one time.
Congrats to Paul Wood @bbcnews for award winning coverage of fight against #ISIS @rtca2015. @PennyCrook @BBCKimGhattas @LauraTrevelyan
Different responses to college crises: Paterno is denied final three games @PennStateFball. Boeheim is allowed three years @syrbasketball.
After #Israeli elections, history repeats itself. #Obama will pass an Oslo process in free fall to his successor. http://t.co/GkjFqooEEP
The #Israeli elections don't change prospects of a nuclear agreement with #Iran. PM Netanyahu can't scuttle them. http://t.co/GkjFqoGg3p
Great reporting @ajam tonight, putting in context the challenges of chlorine bombs in #Syria and intercepting heroin at the U.S. border.
PM #Netanyahu bottom line: Sanctions are better than inspections at forcing change in #Iran. In truth, both courses involve high risk.
PM #Netanyahu believes until #@Iran behaves like a normal country, sanctions and the declining price of oil is better than a "bad deal."
PM #Netanyahu does an effective job of laying out the risks of a "bad deal" but does not have an alternative to intrusive inspections.
PM Netanyahu says the "enemy of your enemy (the Islamic State) is your enemy." True, but Iraq and Syria cannot be resolved without Iran.
Give Netanyahu credit. He knows how to deliver a speech and his audience, contrasting the stated goals of U.S. and Iranian constitutions.
PM Netanyahu strikes a bipartisan tone with gestures towards Senator Harry Reid and President Obama. Strong message to follow.
.@BHVT @stephenWalt The U.S. won't be friends with this Iranian regime. It can contain Iran, but the view in the region is different.
As we listen to the #Israeli PM's speech, keep in mind a point emphasized by @stephenWalt: our interests overlap, but are not identical.
Listening to @AprilDRyan @Politics_Prose talk about her new book, The Presidency in Black &amp; White.
@nolesfan2011 @PJCrowley The TSA agent who is keeping bombs off planes merits our support and gratitude. This remains a front line.
@MEClosets @PJCrowley @balihai2 I completely agree, but we wouldn't treat a soldier this way and shouldn't treat a TSA agent this way.
Dereliction of duty: As #ISIL expands, Congress fails to fund #DHS, the national security agency charged with preventing acts of terrorism.
My take on the extremist label debate. Be specific. Focus on the strategy, not the bumper sticker. http://t.co/qeb7LRRIds @usnews @IPDGC

Heading for a decisive point in the @NBCNews #BrianWilliams crisis, whether viewed as an isolated error or long pattern of embellishment.
@willowfire01 Putin's economy is in pain because of the declining cost of oil. That has much more to do with the Middle East than Ukraine.
With President Hadi's resignation in #Yemen, another post-Arab Awakening country slides back to square one, with #Tunisia the exception.
Message from @SpeakerBoehner and @IsraeliPM to Israeli voters: Good relations with Congress compensate for a tense one with @BarackObama.

Excellent question from Senator Johnson: The "doing what needs to be done" depends on which conflict we're talking about. More than one.

@ProfJasonRich @PJCrowley it appears the call on the ice was good goal even though the puck had not crossed the line before the whistle.
The Olympics needs a better review system. Two times in two days (Japan-Russia, U.S.-Canada) where the on-ice goal call has been wrong.

@EjmAlrai @msnbc @NowWithAlex #Syria needs better choices. #Assad must go and #ISIS must be contained. Opposition needs to unify.

Discussed #Syria @msnbc @NowWithAlex. #Assad is in a stronger position entering 2014 than a year ago, and more confident he can survive.
Told @msnbc @NowWithAlex a #Sisi presidency would be popular and perhaps stable, but actually move #Egypt farther away from democracy.
Today's deadly missile attack on #CampLiberty is a grim reminder of the international community failure to rapidly resettle refugees there.

The #Iranian nuclear agreement has overshadowed the other news from #Geneva, that the #Syria conference is scheduled for early next year.
The early criticism of the interim agreement is it doesn't dismantle #Iran's nuclear program. That is simply not realistic at this point.
“@NishaChittal: Wow. RT @JohnCornyn: Amazing what WH will do to distract attention from O-care”  He cannot be serious.
The interim nuclear agreement with #Iran puts time on the clock to seek a permanent solution. An historic step forward but more work to do.

@KunwarKhalidYun @PJCrowley @husainhaqqani Coaxing the MB to compete under some banner will be a key to calling the process inclusive.
@mooretommyh The lack of trust is a factor, but the IAEA can put an intrusive inspection regime in place to detect a breakout by #Iran.

@jrishmawi Americans didn't select Morsi, #Egyptians did. If he was a mistake, the best corrective is an election and not a coup.
@AhmedWagih @jrishmawi The fact that #Egyptians will vote on a constitution first and then parliament and a president is important.
@abeerallamj @jrishmawi @AhmedWagih #Egyptians will decide, but to be democratic, there must be a genuine choice.

@jrishmawi @AhmedWagih The elections are about #Egypt's interests. To be legitimate, all #Egyptians must feel their views were represented.
@jrishmawi @ahmedwagih If #Egyptians don't like the FJP platform, the democratic answer is not to bar them; it is not to vote for them.

Man arrested for naming his donkey after General al-Sisi. #Egypt defends its record on free speech. The donkey can say anything it wants.
The #EU says #Iraq is holding seven people in prison near #Baghdad who were at #CampAshraf when it was attacked by Iraqi forces on 9/1.
#Egypt's new inclusive democracy will be tricameral: an upper house, lower house and big house, the latter for the Muslim Brotherhood.
@drRouhani: Given #Iran is a victim of chemical weapons, should the #UN identify who committed this crime against humanity in #Syria?
#Brazilian President Rousseff postpones state visit to Washington due to spying accusations. She seems to believe style points do matter.
@Andrewtalker The U.S. is not a party to the #ICC, having declined to sign and ratify the Rome Statute, as allowed by the treaty.
100,000 people have died in the #Syrian civil war and #Damascus accuses #Ankara of escalation after a helicopter shootdown? That's rich.
#Iran's digital defenses are back up, perhaps reflecting an internal struggle over Iran's external connections. http://t.co/riFAr7K2Ja
If crimes against humanity have meaning, the #UN should tell #Sudanese President Bashir he can't attend #UNGA until he engages the #ICC.
Hello #Iran. Glad to have you back on social media networks. A very interesting moment in Iranian relations with the world.
The shooting in #Washington is the leading story on many #European networks, the lens through which the world once again views #America.
Here in #Bucharest with @adaystew @IPDGC, @PhilipSeib and @NickCull for a forum focused on #Romania's new #publicdiplomacy initiative.
@EBursofsky Public opinion would shift some if diplomacy stalls, but not enough to gain a #House majority in favor of a military strike.
@SottileStephen #Russia sees cooperation on chemical weapons as a means of keeping #Assad in power. The U.S. policy us he must step down.
A vote on #Syria might not happen at all. Given public opposition, it's not clear members will want to weigh in should diplomacy fail.
Though #Moscow and #Washington have common interests regarding #Syrian chemical weapons, their starting and end points are very different.
@jtimpane pjcrowley@gwu.edu
The trials of #Kenya's leaders in The Hague do not infringe on the country's sovereignty. Nairobi chose to give the #ICC jurisdiction.
Now hugging the #Russian proposal, it remains curious that the #Obama administration first treated Kerry's off-hand remark as an orphan.
The president's speech as delivered was probably shorter than the draft he reviewed before the Russian proposal. In a holding pattern.
The president is following a constitutional path in seeking the approval of Congress but at one point he was prepared to act without it.
The chemical attacks in #Syria may be a fact, but one it denies. Waiting for the UN inspection results strengthens the case for action.
While the #Obama administration explains why #Syria is not #Iraq circa 2003, the #Russian proposal would turn Syria into Iraq circa 1991.
If a #UN resolution codifies the #Russian proposal, and authorizes intrusive inspections, #Syria would resemble #Iraq, but circa 1991.
#Obama gains from the #Russian offer. If #Assad gives up the weapons, problem solved. If not, it strengthens the case for military action.
#Putin just offered #Obama a lifeboat, a diplomatic solution that allows the postponement of a vote on military action he may well lose.
Comparing General el-Sisi to George Washington? One declined to be king; the other is acting like a Pharaoh. http://t.co/Ex42Mkitsh
Once again, the U.S. war narrative includes a cameo by Hitler. But if #Assad is that horrific, why are we proposing only limited action?
Everyone is focused on #Obama and #Putin at the G-20 Summit but not #XiJinping. #China is content to let #Russia take the lead on #Syria.
Members of Congress keep asking for guarantees prior to military action. No such thing. The U.S. is only one actor in the #Syrian tragedy.
#Egyptian court labels #AlJazeera Egypt Live a "rebellious demon," a hint of how much Cairo's "inclusive" government fears a free press.
Congress will require a diplomatic plan to end the violence in #Syria within 30 days. On Day 31, Assad, Iran and Russia will ignore it.
Former SecDef and Bill Cohen on @AJAM says the President, having requested a vote in Congress on #Syria, should abide by the result.
@lyda This is strictly speaking about enforcing international norms, not law, keeping chemical weapons out of a war we can't solve.
@MAKtweeter The first strike will be intense and brief. Over time, we may have to do it again if (or when) chemical weapons resurface.
@PeasantParty Disagree. #Israel is fearful #Syria diverts attention from #Iran. #SaudiArabia knows we are not going to get deeply involved.
#Assad will test the red line, so deterrence may require more than one military strike. Congressional approval must include flexibility.
Good discussion on #Syria @pbsnewshour. US policy is containing the civil war minus chem weapons until a political solution is available.
@ianbremmer Prediction: The Senate votes for. If the House trends negative, Boehner avoids a down vote and #Obama acts with what he has.
Job Opportunity: President of #Egypt. Fringe benefits include likelihood of early retirement, lodging at state expense and a show trial.
The administration spent last week arguing why #Syria is not #Iraq, but that question will dominate the debate over the next two weeks.
Perhaps #Obama felt he still needed more international political legitimacy to compensate for the lack of a formal mandate on #Syria.
Conflicted war narratives: Regime change in #Libya was "not hostilities," while a "shot across the bow" in #Syria requires a Hill vote.
@JeffersonObama @chrislhayes The question  in #Syria is not doing too much but whether it will be enough to difference a difference.
The British vote on #Syria could complicate #Obama's consultations with Congress. The administration will need to strengthen its case.
The #British vote against action in #Syria doesn't bind #Obama per se, but it will affect the perceived legitimacy of whatever is done.
@geoffrey_cain Every intervention sets the parameters for a generation. The consequences of #Iraq will handicap policymaking for years.
@omar_au The politics surrounding action against #Syria is complicated, but the case can be made. Leaders should take the time to do so.
The #Vietnam syndrome is officially dead. It has been replaced by the #Iraq syndrome, with serious policy implications at home and abroad.
The #FortHood shooter wanted to be put to death. A more sophisticated verdict would have been life in prison as a murderer, not a martyr.
@RLMcMahon @stephenfhayes The mayhem in #Syria does present extremists with room to operate but this is not fertile ground for #AlQaeda.
@RLMcMahon @stephenfhayes There is an organized #Syrian political opposition that would be part of an interim transitional government.
If U.S. policy is Assad's departure through political means, the contemplated use of force in #Syria should support the broader objective.
The #ArabLeague statement helps build the case for action in #Syria but more time is needed to properly align the politics and strategy.
@IvoHDaalder The Geneva Protocol is a source of legitimacy. Beyond the use, intelligence must point to the regime's finger on the trigger.
@SMArikat My guess is the purpose of military action in #Syria would be to deter further use of chemical weapons, not tilt the battlefield.
One catch to invoking the #CWC to justify military action is #Syria is not a party to the treaty, but it is responsible for its weapons.
The U.S. seems to be pointing at the chemical weapons convention as a potential source of legitimacy as it considers what to do in #Syria.
@medablog Having served in the first Gulf War, quite aware of the risks of military action. There are no cost-free options to #Syria.
@medablog The U.S. did not have to invade #Iraq nor must it "go into" #Syria. Sending a message to #Assad is different and now necessary.
@IbothaboAfrica1 Because of #Iraq, the #Obama track record shows a strong preference for action with partners and with regional support.
@ThinkerSFO This is the first time a military response against #Syria is the only option. The U.S. must build its case to gain legitimacy.
@Sean_OHalloran Happy to join you to discuss #Syria. Please provide details. Depending on timing, a pre-record via Skype may be best.
One potential disconnect emerging with #Syria is that the politics favoring a response will move faster than the #UN investigation.
Kosovo is an apt precedent for #Syria but a divided Arab League may not be able to provide the legitimacy NATO did. http://t.co/NWyPt0ZQjt
@bebird @PicoBee @LVview To a large extent, having all sides mad at the United States for actions or inaction comes with the territory.
@bebird A 1993 cruise missile strike at the #Iraqi Intel HQ after a plot against President Bush sent a message Saddam heard and heeded.
@NicolasTetrault The question is whether #Syria is still a single political entity, or now four cantons defined by religion or ethnicity.
@EBursofsky Should the UN inspection team's evidence point to the regime, the cruise missile option will receive a lot of consideration.
@LesMajestey The UN inspection team is there to find out, but only one side has the weapons, the knowledge and motivation to use them.
@democraticbear A punitive strike against #Syria carries risk, but the chemical attack is a dangerous escalation that cannot be ignored.
@Djerejian Not only must a response to #Syria be carefully calibrated, it must also receive strong regional support to achieve legitimacy.
The #Syrian chemical attack likely will necessitate a response that punishes #Assad without being drawn into the middle of the civil war.
@bbc5live @lucyEgrey More diplomacy must be focused on #Russia and the region, which will feel the impact of whatever happens in #Syria.
#Mubarak's transfer is incidental to the coup but the optics pose a problem for both the #Egyptian military and the #Obama administration.
#Snowden does not mark a return to the #ColdWar but #Syria does, given how #Russia has prevented the #UN from taking meaningful action.
@inashabib @DafnaLinzer The unsolved problem for #Egypt is the opposition has proven what it is united against, but not yet what it is for.
@inashabib @DafnaLinzer The absence of a parliament inhibited the emergence of an effective check and balance to #Morsi's overreach. True.
Talking #Syria in first appearance on @AJCONSIDERTHIS. Latest use of chemical weapons is potential escalation of multi-sided conflict.
@TheBigPharaoh @AhmdAlish @S_Nassar @msnbc To those who regretted their vote for Morsi, the best democratic do-over is the next election.
@S_Nassar @msnbc @AhmdAlish if 30 million Egyptians protested for Morsi's removal, where were they during the 2011 presidential campaign?
@benjaminwittes @lib_ertarian_ @kevinjonheller @ggreenwald Benjamin is right but the errant tweet says a lot about #Assange-media tension.
The U.S. policy problem is its current objective for #Egypt, inclusive democracy within nine months, is no longer achievable. Plan D?
Talked #Egypt @OutFrontCNN. The existing U.S. policy has been overtaken by today's violence. It was a coup and it's time to say so.
The generals in #Egypt are playing hardball. The U.S. chose after the, um, coup to play softball. Looking for all that leverage we gained.
The last time #Egypt imposed emergency law, it remained in effect for 30 years. Hardly conducive to inclusive participatory democracy.
The latest on #Egypt's democracy restoration: generals appointed governors and security forces clash with protesters. Is it a coup yet?
Conservatives in #Iran are pushing back, but #Rouhani's choice of #Zarif as foreign minister reinforces his stated interest in engagement.
@love2golf @pgachamp Until #PhilMickelson won the British Open, the Empire had won three consecutive majors. It must be the beer!
#NorthKorea's decision to reopen the Kaesong plant is not about grand strategy. The closure was impetuous and now they need the money.
@carolmalouf Generating an external controversy for political gain is one option. Actually solving #Pakistan's problems is a better one.
Nawaz Sharif is back and tensions promptly rise along the Line of Control in #Kashmir. The last thing #Pakistan needs is a return to 1999.
#China decided it didn't want #Snowden to be the face of its relationship with the United States. Obviously #Russia has no such qualms.
@ashthoughts Just finished a wide range of news interviews regarding the #BradleyManning verdict.  Happy to join ABC Australia to discuss.
The judge in the #BradleyManning case made the correct decision by rejecting the prosecution's argument on the aiding the enemy charge.
The restart of #MiddleEastPeace negotiations is important even if the prospects are uncertain. Progress will be made in inches, not yards.
The #Egyptian military follows Nasser's playbook and the #Obama administration still can't utter the word coup. http://t.co/0uNrwjx7ri
If Julian Assange gets elected to the #Australian Senate, can he join debates via #Skype and cast votes by email? http://t.co/tXXP9GHnPY
@theodric Plastic ball and bat. If you get hit by one, it usually doesn't hurt. Like a wiffle ball, holding the F-16s will leave no mark.
U.S. officials call withholding F-16s an "inside fastball" to the #Egyptian military. More like a brush back pitch with a whiffle ball.
@ShibleyTelhami at #ASF2013: Israeli-Palestinian relations is not driving current events but is the prism through which U.S. is perceived.
@wrightr at #ASF2013: U.S. policy may be reverting to form in #Egypt, favoring short-term stability vs. long-term support for democracy.
@ShibleyTelhami at #ASF2013: Information revolution helped early political mobilization, individual empowerment during the #ArabAwakening.
Great discussion @AaronHarber on foreign policy challenges and the changing nature of the terrorist threat. Worth watching. #ASF2013
@G_Glennwald His point was about math. To read billions of emails, you would need millions on staff. He does not command such legions.
Gen Carter Ham at #ASF2013: political changes/sensitivities in #Libya have hampered ability to bring #Benghazi perpetrators to justice.
Gen Carter Ham at #ASF2013: if we want the ability to respond to any contingency within two hours, be prepared to write a very big check.
Gen Carter Ham at #ASF2013 said there was no advance threat intel on #Benghazi. He does not believe Amb Chris Stevens saw a threat either.
@olgarbl The NSA is changing procedures to improve internal security, but a determined insider will periodically emerge and can do damage.
Mike Hayden at #ASF2013: As the U.S. comes off the offensive with the Afghan withdrawal, it must place greater emphasis on defense.

Gen Keith Alexander at #ASF2013 said, for #NSA to do the monitoring people claim, half the country would have to listen to the other half.
General Keith Alexander at #ASF2013 says extremist groups have changed tactics and procedures in aftermath of #Snowden revelations.
@VodkaPundit @mitchellreports Americans on site have been interviewed, but they can't add precise insight into the attack's prior planning.
@VodkaPundit @mitchellreports This is about understanding who participated in the attack, including #AlQaeda sympathizers and thugs.
#NCTC Director Matt Olsen at #ASF2013 said #Benghazi was an act of terror but the complexity of the attack is still not fully understood.
John McLaughlin at #ASF2013: #Syria is a dream come true for #AlQaeda, offering the potential to hold some territory in the Middle East.
#Snowden's actions could potentially disrupt ongoing efforts to better fuse information, which was the takeaway following 9/11. #ASF2013
Intelligence panel at #ASF2013 sees erosion of the national state, increased ungoverned space and regional conflict as key future threats.
@richieq123 Americans expect government to protect them. We will cede some privacy for more security. We're rightly debating that balance.
@PR_uno Others make decisions every day that affect our security. Two brothers made a tragic decision to attack my hometown, Boston.
@riotta  I believe the #NSA programs are legal and useful. We are debating the balance between security and privacy, which is important.
Former #DNI Dennis Blair suggests Americans are more inconvenienced from the no fly list than telephone metadata programs. #ASF2013
DoD's Ash Carter calls #Snowden actions a cyber system failure, due to over-consolidation vs. compartmentalization of information. #ASF2013
DoD Deputy Ash Carter at #ASF2013 suggests a national underinvestment in cyber security, a "market failure" within the private sector.
@Ferjani9arwi The unwillingness to call #Egypt a coup adds to Washington's credibility problem in the Middle East regarding democracy.
Those who want to seal our borders should ask #AF Chief Mark Welsh talk about a #Bosnian refugee who enlisted joined to pay us back.
#AirForce Chief of Staff Mark Welsh at #ASF2013 says that sequestration affects the service's ability to do a no fly zone in #Syria.
Four former officials talking at #ASF2013, confused why the U.S. hasn't called #Egypt a coup and adjusted its policy around that fact.
A sign of social media's public diplomacy potential: #Panama President @rmartinelli tweets incriminating photo from the #NorthKorean ship.
@rshidhyder The administration sees calling it a coup (and cutting off aid) and supporting #Egyptian democracy as mutually exclusive.
Hats off to #JanetNapolitano for her leadership @DHSgov, guiding a still new and complex department through a vital maturation process.
@rshidhyder It was a coup, which may deepen #democracy long term but did damage now. The new order is not yet inclusive or transparent.
The #Chinese message on #Snowden is it was resolved through Hong Kong law, meaning we were happy to re-gift him to our #Russian friends.
The #Chinese at the #S&amp;ED @StateDept mentioned #Snowden unprompted in public remarks. They viewed him all along as an unwelcome elephant.
@SorayaBahgat Agree that #Palestinian elections are long overdue, but for now both #Fatah and #Hamas are fearful of an uncertain result.
@Ferjani9arwi Touché. :)
Outlawing a religious party you don't like is not #democracy. Convincing a majority of #Egyptians to vote for a secular alternative is.
If the military keeps arresting MB leaders, it becomes hard to credibly argue #Egypt is moving towards an inclusive political system.
Good line @JoeBiden @StateDept. #JackLew, @USTreasury and prior OMB, is sometimes torn whether it's better to spend more money or less.
@ahmedyounisjd The lack of consensus means the opposition is splintered. It encourages the #MuslimBrotherhood to continue to hold out.
Talking about #Egypt @AlexWitt @msnbc, the failure to reach consensus on #ElBaradei as PM is a disaster for the interim government.
#ElBaradei's selection as #Egypt's PM is a positive but the interim government has to find a way to get the #MuslimBrotherhood reengaged.
The first Hugo Chavez Memorial Award for Regional Antagonism goes to Nicholas Maduro of #Venezuela. Bolivia and Ecuador demand a recount.
@violentfanon Vienna is not relevant here, but I argued the U.S. would be ill-advised to mess with a leader's flight plan. I doubt it did.
U.S. aid could be suspended if #Egypt staged a "military coup." Given it acted with such popular support, it is a complicated question.
As Democracy 2.0 begins in #Egypt, what did key players learn from the past two years? Can they move together from zero to positive sum?
We will hear competing narratives in the coming hours in #Egypt, about democracy vs. legitimacy, about elections vs. effective governance.
This depicts #Egypt's problem in a nutshell: citizens protest, but resist investment in the political process. http://t.co/h6VRCcbD1O
Europeans are being sanctimonious about espionage, but not long ago, Americans were feasting on freedom fries. Mutually assured chirping.
Contradictions in #Egyptian opinion reveal #publicdiplomacy challenge: U.S. is propping up #Morsi and complicit in military's ultimatum.

#Qatar's new emir is putting his own team in place, which means the departure of PM/FM Sheik #Hamad. He was effective and will be missed.
One more time, why did #Musharraf return to #Pakistan? It's the second time he thought he was indispensable, only to be shown otherwise.
@jm111t @dabeard @StateDept #China didn't want #Snowden to become the face of the relationship, so they passed the hot potato to #Russia.
@jm111t @dabeard @StateDept @WashPost Talking about different things. Politics regards how #Russia and #China responded to U.S. appeals.
@dabeard @StateDept Wrong! The administration did not err in the #Snowden case. As I told @washpost, this is about politics, not the law.
In #Australia, a friend of the U.S. leaves and a friend returns as prime minister. #KevinRudd is a terrific global strategic thinker.
A youth movement in #Qatar is a transition from a 61 to 33-year-old emir. In #SaudiArabia, it will be to a king already in his eighties.

President-elect #Rowhani demands the U.S. stop interfering in #Iran's "domestic politics." What is #Iran doing in #Syria? A good neighbor.
A potential first ballot victory by #Rohani in #Iran has to be viewed as a vote of little confidence in the policies of the #Ayatollah.
U.S. decided weeks ago to arm the #Syrian opposition, but linking it to chemical weapons use stirs the ghosts of #Iraq. Unfair but there.
It's not clear extending arms to the #Syrian opposition will be a game-changer, more like another tactical step in a long-term challenge.
@Daniel__Harvey Nothing prevented the kind of Congressional hearings we have now. We didn't need a leak to achieve meaningful oversight.
#PTdefense Three strategic countries will meaningfully impact U.S. national security over the next decade: #China, #Iran and #Pakistan.
#PTdefense A11: Snowden's actions were unwise. NSA surveillance is rooted in law. The debate is useful; less damaging ways to trigger it.
#PTdefense A10: The six #Iranian candidates running today are birds of a conservative feather. I don't see a breakthrough any time soon.
#PTdefense A9: The #NorthKorean people are not better off. The U.S. can contain #KimJongUn until his family business inevitably implodes.
#PTdefense A8: Google the #EgyptInfluenceNetwork, a #Twitter map when #Mubarak fell. The U.S. must engage such networks wherever they are.
#PTdefense A7: Modern political campaigns tweet (hopefully without body parts). If @HillaryClinton runs, social media will be an key tool.
#PTdefense The subpoena was legal, the secrecy counterproductive. A negotiation with AP would have better balanced competing interests.
#PTdefense A5: Millions of people are on-line discussing your product. Better to engage them than ignore them. A sense of humor is useful.
#PTdefense A4: Our military capability is not jeopardized by projected cuts. We need to resolve more crises through non-military means.
#PTdefense A3: Citizen journalists in #Syria helped us understand the tragedy despite traditional media suppression by the #Assad regime.
#PTdefense A2: Internationally, elites are on social media. They also care more about foreign policy, so it's a good diplomatic match.
@PTdefense The new #Obama national security team is experienced. They understand the necessity of American leadership but also its limits.
The North-South #Korea talks end before they begin. They couldn't even agree on who would attend, much less Pyongyang's extortion demand.
Talks between North and South #Korea are welcome but also part of a pattern. The meeting will be more about money, less about peace.
@AmbassadorRice and #SamanthaPower are strong believers in American leadership in the world. #Syria will pose an early test for both.

@jaketapper There is much we don't know, but a leap to system failure suggests all acts of terrorism are preventable. Not in a democracy.
Anyone claiming #Boston is a system failure expects law enforcement to make all hits and no errors. Not realistic in baseball or security.
@RATZ92 Chemical weapons, whether using them or losing control of them, is a unique dimension of the #Syrian challenge.
@chunkielover63 @SimaDiab The #Syrian conflict is primarily for the region to resolve. Chemical weapons can make it a global challenge.
@Saraikee The conditions that came together in #Libya - #NATO, #ArabLeague and #UN support - will be hard to replicate for #Syria.
The U.S. edges closer to its red line on chemical weapons in #Syria but will need to build more international support before responding.
The .political narrative after #Boston is our intelligence and immigration systems failed, but no changes were required after #Newtown.
The question of what to do after #Boston. We talk a lot about the #Internet and travel, but it was the bomb that made them dangerous.
@DUE_DILIGENCE2 There are complicated legal questions in declaring a U.S. citizen an enemy combatant. Our civilian justice system works.
The push to declare #DzhokharTsarnaev an enemy combatant aside, with 84 detainees on a hunger strike, we don't need more issues at #GTMO.
@Tseday The video at the finish line and subsequent possession of explosives indicate involvement. The government must prove culpability.
@UrbanAchievr Whatever facts emerge over time regarding his actions and motives, this case can be fairly adjudicated in civilian court.
The American people have greater faith in the #Constitution and confidence in our civilian courts than the #GTMOThree in the #Senate.
#DzhokharTsarnaev's schoolmates in #Boston are coping with what he did, but their portrait of him is hardly that of an enemy combatant.
@MajorCBS added a new term to the national security lexicon. White House maintained "operational curiosity" during the #Boston manhunt.
#Boston, we have a victory here tonight!
Some see intelligence needs and the rule of law as incompatible, but recent experience is quite different. We can meet both imperatives.
Congratulations to law enforcement at all levels - federal, state and local - for incredible work to apprehend the remaining suspect.
Best possible outcome that the suspect is taken alive, which allows everyone to understand why they decided to bomb the #BostonMarathon.
The #Boston attack reinforces our understanding of the evolving terrorist threat, individual actors, decentralized, unpredictable.
The immediate question after #Boston was domestic or international? It appears to be a hybrid, a homegrown act and international agenda.
With the link to a local community college, they were rooted in the community. Feeling isolated, they would be ripe for radicalization.
Now that authorities know names, they are tracking who else the #Boston suspects associated with and any network they communicated with.
That the suspects were still in #Boston, had inadequate funding and tried to rob a 7-11 store suggests a limit to their expertise.
If the two #Boston suspects were from #Chechnya, the next question is who sent them (if anyone) and beyond killing people, what agenda?
@barbaraslavin1 @paaia The poll demonstrates the #NCRI has work to do to grow support inside and outside #Iran. They now have that chance.
#Obama in #Boston: We were knocked off our feet. We picked ourselves up. We finished the race. We will run again, stronger than ever.
#DevalPatrick: #Massachusetts invented #America! And the grace that we display will overcome the darkness. Well said.
The Interfaith Service underway in #Boston, reinforcing what binds rather than divides us, is the most effective response to terrorism.
Incredible moments at #BruinsSabres game. Fans wearing #BostonStrong ribbons and cheering "Go Boston!" The city's comeback is underway.
The #Senate thought ducking a tough vote on background checks was less risky than making one. The people need to change that calculation.
The #Senate fails to advance the background check legislation, a failure of political courage that will resonate both at home and abroad.
Some claim complacency after #Boston as if we failed to act after 9/11. In fact, we overreacted. Nothing wrong with refusing to be afraid.
As a life-long @RedSox fan, appreciate the @Yankees tribute to  #Boston this evening at the Stadium, reflecting the teams' shared history.
Given how much ground women have lost in the #MiddleEast recently, an #Iranian political movement led by a woman challenges this status quo.
@Anon_Central  Fair point about #JFK and #Oswald, international or domestic. But if #AQ did this, it wasn't to influence the gun debate.
@TerraTech10 @BBCNews A bomb does not by itself define terrrorism. It's the political agenda behind an attack by civilians on civilians.
Suggested @BBCNews that it's possible the #Bostonbombing carried an international or a domestic political agenda. We don't know.
#MelanneVerveer @IPDGC: It is important when the greatest country on earth puts women on the agenda and says that their issues matter.

#DonSteinberg @USAID @IPDGC: We will not fight our way out of #Afghanistan but can develop our way to success. Girls in school are key.
#DonSteinberg @USAID @IPDGC: Simple things like helping women with land tenure, which opens the door to obtain credit, can change lives.
#DonSteinberg @USAID @IPDGC: U.S. policy includes efforts to prevent child marriage and help married children around the world.
#DonSteinberg @USAID @IPDGC: Development must be inclusive including all marginalized groups, but especially women.
#MelanneVerveer @IPDGC: Women are increasingly targets in conflict. They need to play a greater role in conflict resolution and recovery.
#MelanneVerveer @IPDGC: Women in any society are like canaries in the mine. Their condition will tell you a lot about hidden dangers.
#MelanneVerveer @IPDGC: Women's issues need to be fully integrated within policy, not a stand alone domain.
#MelanneVerveer @IPDGC: Empowering women and girls is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.

The cautious media reporting of events in #Boston is commendable. The problem will come when known facts level off but coverage doesn't.
The #Waco siege ended 20 years ago this week. #OklahomaCity occurred two years later. Now a possible bombing in #Boston on Patriots' Day.
@ih8gops #DennisRodman should tell his BFF #KimJongUn he has a better chance of being #NBA commissioner than surviving a war with the U.S.

The long-term problem with #NorthKorea is with a de facto  nuclear deterrent, #Pyongyang is never giving up its regime survival weapon.
Talking #NorthKorea @JansingCo. @JohnKerry in #Seoul has laid resolution of the immediate crisis squarely on #Beijing's doorstep.
If the U.S. establishes no-fly or safe zones in #Syria, it's entering the war. A valid option, but let's be clear about the implications.
On @shepsmith1 @FOXNews, said we have to expect #NorthKorea to launch a missile. If it hits only water, the crisis is still manageable.
What #NorthKorea is doing is a form of swatting, forcing a crisis response not out of amusement but for extortion. http://t.co/6DVU0EW3B2
Told @ElaineReyesTV @CCTV_America if #DPRK fires rocket in coming days, it will certainly add urgency to @JohnKerry talks in the region.

Talked #Iran and #NorthKorea with @ThomasARoberts @MSNBC, Both carry long-term risk, but Pyongyang's nuclear capability is more advanced.
Told @ThomasARoberts #NorthKorea continues to brew a rhetorical storm, but there is little change in the conflict's actual fundamentals.
Welcome to @Twitter @PrezBillyJeff. At 140 characters, it's a tough editor, but no one in our time is better at delivering a one-liner.
My @SMPAGWU #publicdiplomacy class sees @USEmbassyCairo as in error both to tweet the #Morsi @TheDailyShow segment only to retreat later.
Suggested @JansingCo that #China is best positioned to tell #NorthKorea to knock it off. What we don't know is whether they will listen.
Dear #PresidentMorsi, no offense, not meddling, but the best way to fix your falling popularity is to fix your failing #Egyptian economy.

#NorthKorea is not only trying to strengthen the political standing of its young leader, it is challenging #SouthKorea's new president.
Discussed #NorthKorea @ThomasARoberts @MSNBC. If #Pyongyang's propaganda turns into aggressive action, #SouthKorea will likely respond.
@JerryPrag Television is not the culprit. It's the response to having cameras in the chamber. Legislators now talk past each other.
#Russia views the #Syrian opposition as "chaotic." I guess a tidier solution would be to make #Assad prime minister. It worked in #Moscow.
Television has made government more accessible, but diminished the quality of debate and effectiveness of Congress. http://t.co/JQ47Z1OJKb

@Avracado With #Bosnia and #Kosovo, it took time for diplomacy to create conditions for which intervention was appropriate and supported.
Reminded today in #GWU class how much #Bosnia and #Kosovo, and questions of vital interests, arms and UN authorization, resemble #Syria.
Can #SecState @JohnKerry can get in and out of #Afghanistan before #Karzai says something daft for short-term political gain? A toss up.
As @JNSmall @Time reported, @JohnKerry's sub-rosa weekend travel says a lot about how #Iraq remains ten years later a work in progress.
The #Pentagon's cost of building a new prison at #Guantanamo: $49M. The U.S. public diplomacy cost of keeping it open: priceless. @IPDGC
Obama's #MiddleEast trip resembles his #NCAA bracket: many positive outcomes, plausible options for success and lots of unpredictability.
@ValArgen I don't see #Iran benefitting from today's call. Strategic cooperation between #Turkey and #Israel undercuts Tehran's narrative.
#NorthKorea will undoubtedly stymie the #UN investigation, but it makes Pyongyang's abysmal human rights record even harder to ignore.
It took almost three years to engineer today's call with #Netanyahu and #Erdogan. There's still tension but this is a big step forward.
The U.S. protested #Syrian airstrikes that violated #Lebanese sovereignty even as the #UN made the same charge of the U.S. in #Pakistan.

@JJCarafano I agree w/ @SenRandPaul the drone hypothetical is concerning, but #Holder's letter mirrors #Cheney's shootdown dilemma on 9/11.
@JJCarafano #Padilla was first taken from Chicago to a military brig, so the line @senrandpaul is drawing is not gloss and has meaning.
In criticizing #EricHolder's answer on drone use, @SenRandPaul is supporting a law enforcement approach to terrorism his caucus rejected.
@sxpert1 @chavezcandanga The new #Venezuelan leader should say what he is for, not just who he is against. The U.S. will listen closely.

Discussed #NorthKorea with #ShepardSmith @FOXNews. #DennisRodman and #KimJongUn is the indiscernible talking with the inexplicable.
Dennis Rodman has a message for #Obama from #KimJongUn: #CallMeMaybe. The Young Leader has a better chance of being elected Pope.
Visit within #Syria by opposition leader #alKhatib is an important step. His visibility is linked to perceived political legitimacy.
@southpro1957 #Morsi is no democrat, but needs U.S. help to survive. @ElBaradei's is a democrat, but right now he keeps his distance.
@LCellini @IPDGC #Mubarak was a U.S. ally. #Morsi will require U.S. help to survive. Right now, political distance is more advantageous.
Calls for suspension of U.S. aid to #Egypt are short-sighted, but the balance between military and economic assistance should be adjusted.
Interesting the democratically inclined opposition calculates it's better to keep @SecState at arm's length during his Cairo stop. @IPDGC
@StateDept criticized the #DennisRodman trip to #Pyongyang as "business as usual." There is little about him that fits the term usual.
@MikeBloomberg on @charlierose: one billion people in the world will die from smoking in the 21st Century. That's the loss of a #China.

Great line by @SecState Kerry, joking about a faux headline while speaking to diplomatic personnel in #Rome: Kerry Arrives, Pope Goes!
Ike's Bluff @evanthomasbooks a fine read. Having avoided small wars in office, his advice later was to declare war in #Vietnam or get out.
@vermicelli Agree. Candidates with the right temperament and instincts to govern frequently don't run or are early primary casualties.
@williamarzt Thanks as always. Did you go to Arizona for the #Accenture golf tournament? Great finish despite cold and snow.
#Iran would certainly benefit if its 2013 election presented a wider range of choices, but that is certainly not in the cards.
@SecState Kerry is right that #Iran's government is elected. Its 2009 margin of victory was questionable even if the outcome was not.
While the #Senate has cleared the way for #ChuckHagel's confirmation, it is a wonder given the #sequester that he still wants the job.
On @NowWithAlex, suggested to those proposing military intervention in #Syria, we'd be starting a war and #sequester at the same time.
#Putin restricts smoking in public places in #Russia. Next up, smaller servings of #vodka? @MikeBloomberg can offer strategic advice.
In nuclear talks in #Almaty, #Iran demands sanctions relief and movie rights to #Argo sequel. Film will be shot in black and white.

Topics from #Brennan hearing: rewriting history on EITs, OLC memos, leaks, WH media relations and the #alQaeda threat. Priorities jumbled.
#JohnBrennan talks about recent regional unrest which gives #alQaeda the opportunity to plant roots in poorly governed space like #Mali.
More than three hours and finally @SenDanCoats asks a substantive question about the evolving #alQaeda threat and what we still confront.
#JohnBrennan invites members of #AlQaeda to surrender worldwide before they are destroyed. Not likely they will take up his offer.
@SenatorFeinstein demonstrates that important details about specific plots can be discussed in public while protecting classified details.
#JohnBrennan's answer on "liberating" drone strikes may apply to #Yemen, but it is obvious #Pakistan does not view them this way.
Regarding @SenatorCollins' question about strikes vs. detention, the real change is turning drones into a force protection weapon.
What's remarkable so far in the #JohnBrennan confirmation hearing is there are so few questions about drones. It's like a third rail.
@marcorubio does not appear to believe the rule of law is compatible with combating terrorism. They most certainly are.
The Senate Intelligence Committee is so focused on leaks and political score settling, you'd hardly know we're still at war with al Qaeda.

#Iran's jailing of journalists for allegedly working with the "hostile" @BBC is a Cold War throwback that ignores global media realities.
@SecState paid tribute to #RichardHolbrooke in today's town hall. Our #Afghanistan-#Pakistan strategy became more tactical after his loss.
The sequester is more a strategic than a budget problem. To preserve more future capability, we could accelerate the #Afghan transition.
@SecState #HillaryClinton's 59 global town halls is part of an exceptional legacy, expanding the breadth of U.S. public diplomacy. @IPDGC
In the Senate, #JohnKerry had considerable leeway in shaping the foreign relations agenda. As @SecState, the world gets a much bigger say.

The #fiscalcliff will not raise eyebrows in #Mali, but reaching a deal or not will shape perceptions of the U.S. in lots of other places.
#Israel would be better served by #publicdiplomacy that builds rather than sinks a legitimate #Palestinian economy. http://t.co/cb5U2k9s
#Assad's departure from #Syria would be a major development but would not by itself resolve the unfolding tragedy. http://t.co/xH5kbME0
The #Egyptian constitutional referendum evidently passes, but it does not have perceived legitimacy, a leadership challenge for #Morsi.
Another American to rescue from #NorthKorean custody. We're short of former Presidents, but the young leader loves #MichaelJordan.
By #NRA logic, female cadets with #Glocks solve the military academy sexual assault problem. If unwise at #WestPoint, unwise elsewhere.
@NoelConfidence Without accepting your premise, although government is not showing much reason at the moment, thank you for the kind words.
The latest example of #Kremlin suppression of freedom of the press: a 4.5 hour #Putin press conference without a bathroom break. @IPDGC
In hearing, @RosLehtinen is cool to more @StateDept security funding despite #Benghazi report, suggesting no lessons learned in Congress.
Watching the #fiscalcliff antics, one understands fans discouraged by poor play who put bags over their heads. Lots of plays, few points.
Ayatollah #Khamenei on @Facebook. His status is 7th Century.
Ayatollah #Khamenei has 6,000 likes on @Facebook. Most are censors watching to see what is posted about him. And Bashar al-Assad. @IPDGC
Can Americans agree after #Newtown that while we have a right to bear arms, fewer of us should do so? We must reassess personal security.
Strong U.S. position at the #WCIT. The #Internet should be guided by civil society aspirations, not autocratic government fears. @IPDGC
Listening to @BWilliams and @AmbassadorRice, the sad irony is almost everything she initially said about #Libya could still be right.
Reading b/w the lines of @AmbassadorRice's letter, she could remain at the #UN now and become #NationalSecurityAdvisor sometime in 2013.
#NorthKorea wants nukes and normalization. The missile test reaffirms they won't give up one for the other. That's been clear for a while.
If the #FiscalCliff and #NHL negotiators traded places, Congress would be locked out instead of the hockey players. Let the games begin!
Leadership and transparency opportunity for #Pakistani President Zadari: file a tax return and release it publicly. http://t.co/4yKdtfUd
Second time is a charm: #NorthKorea's $400 million missile works this time. All North Koreans celebrate, on less than a dollar a day.
After 12 years, #Afghanistan has only one brigade able to operate on its own. Lots of reasons for it, but hardly a record of success.
My latest post @IPDGC #TakeFiveBlog regarding the #Pentagon's strategic communication name change. http://t.co/ILSBMv8V
@JohnKerry is right the international treaty protecting the disabled was a test of American leadership by example. The Senate failed.
The world according to @SenJonKyl: if #China, #Iran and #Syria are for it, we're against it, even if it is a treaty helping the disabled.
Point accepted, but it reinforces the broader argument. @Pontifex could start with the Church of England. @ChristianGlawe @emptywheel
The #E1 announcement puts a clear choice before #Israeli voters. Should their government build settlements or pursue peace? Can't do both.
The @pontifex decision to only be followed @twitter is a metaphor of the #Church's current challenge. Engagement is a two-way process.
The #Syrian foreign ministry spokesman has defected, vacating what @StateDept described as "the most important position in government." :)
If the U.S. selects who is or is not on @Twitter, autocratic "followers" will use our example to justify their own restrictions. @IPDGC
Curbing political violence requires engaging in and winning the competition of ideas, not shutting it down. http://t.co/BETTXQ9Q @IPDGC
In her #MiddleEast speech @BrookingsFP, @SecState should pivot from frustration with Palestinian #UN vote to the key question: Now what?
Told @NowWithAlex, while today's #UN Palestinian vote could be a catalyst for negotiations, there is a long history of missed chances.
If settlements don't preclude a resumption of #MiddleEast peace negotiations, it's hard to say the #Palestinian UN petition is different.
What color is the sky in @RickSantorum's world given his conspiratorial opposition to the UN convention on the disabled? Dark, very dark!
This may be a Marbury v. Madison moment for #Egypt as #Morsi apparently accepts the judiciary's right to review executive actions. @IPDGC
#YossiBeilin makes a strong argument why #Israel and the U.S. should support the #Palestinian UN petition this week. http://t.co/iLDG95Xg
@NYTimesCohen suggests U.S. should support #Egyptian efforts at #Palestinian reconciliation, a major obstacle to #MiddleEast negotiations.
With the #Gaza ceasefire, the U.S. must retake the initiative in the #MiddleEast. My latest @thedailybeast @IPDGC http://t.co/6YL1PRCj
The #Hamas press conference continues unabated. It could end up being longer than the ceasefire negotiation.
One year after the #BICI report, @StateDept acknowledges human rights and political conditions in #Bahrain are declining, not improving.
#Iran says it supports free, fair and transparent elections in #Syria. Its Quds Force advisors are just there to do political canvassing.
Diplomats in post-conflict societies are at risk. We need them to engage like Chris Stevens did, but politics may cause them to retreat.
Good story @nytimes @robertfworth discussing the policy consequences of our political overreaction to #Benghazi. http://t.co/xF8snnux
A potential loser regarding #Gaza is #PresidentAbbas. The U.S. should take a neutral stance on his bid for enhanced status at the #UN.
President #Morsi of #Egypt has a #ChrisChristie-like calculation to make. Does he focus on national interest or personal affinity?
@HarryShotton #Israel's response must be carefully calibrated and proportional but with all due respect, did not #Hamas fire rockets first?
#Netanyahu and #Morsi have to both act strategically, not easy given that one faces reelection and the other a newly empowered electorate.
A key U.S. strategic interest at risk in the #Gaza crisis is the #Israeli-#Egyptian peace agreement, which #Hamas is trying to destroy.
#Israel has a right to self defense, but ground troops in #Gaza plays into the #Hamas strategy and risks another geo-political disaster.
Note to @DeptofDefense: In light of, um, recent events, we need a new term for "media embed." Attached? No. Bivouac? Better. Tour? Best.
@brettkwan crowley44@gmail.com
@Sean_207 Sean, see my second tweet. Condi was an excellent #SecState. Susan will be as well. There should not be a double standard.
@Sean_207 @SenJohnMcCain @AmbassadorRice
@CondoleezaRice was qualified to be #SecState despite many misstatements about #Iraq. @AmbassadorRice merits the same consideration.
If @SenJohnMcCain says @AmbassadorRice is "not qualified" to be #SecState due to #Benghazi, was@CondoleezaRice given her mushroom cloud?
@dwhelton I saw the Sox insignia!
Rumor is @MassGovernor #DevalPatrick is at the White House. Could they be discussing a #Senate run, freeing @JohnKerry for a cabinet post?
@reallyleila Thanks. A negotiated solution is preferable. Military action would delay an #Iranian weapon, but is strategically costly.
It's hard to contemplate Congress minus the great foreign policy experience of @SenatorLugar and @RepHowardBerman. Just ask #Pakistan.
Panel discussion on Nov. 13 @IPDGC at #GeorgeWashingtonUniversity on #public diplomacy for the next four years. http://t.co/CdlnuZgm
@lrozen #Burma is an engagement success story, for which sanctions have been adjusted. It is not yet a democratic success story. Lots to do.
#Obama's planned trip to #Burma is historic, but a major "give" without a clear "get." The new leadership in #China will also take note.
@GlobeBender @PJCrowley 202-994-6365 for next 90 minutes.
@GlobeBender @PJCrowley
#JonathanCollegio of @AmericanXRoads said they put "a lot of lead on the target." The military calls this friendly fire.
British PM @David_Cameron congratulates #Obama on his reelection. Now planning begins in earnest for the Presidential cricket trip.
Assuming that #Latino voters were decisive in several swing states, #Romney's self-deportation stance was a crucial missed opportunity.
The six billion dollar question: we have repurchased a badly divided government, but did we learn anything about how to make it better?
The budget will be an early test whether a deeply divided government can move off the cliff, reach a deal and preserve U.S. credibility.
It appears in the #Senate races in #Missouri and #Indiana that God stayed on the sidelines and let the voters decide.
If #Democrats add slightly in the #Senate and #Republicans add slightly in the #House, an even more divided government emerges in 2013.
#Ohio, #Florida, #Virginia and #Colorado are too close to call, but the trends suggest a 2-2 result which means an #Obama reelection.
I'll be on @BBCAmerica with @KatyKayBBC later tonight and on BBC Radio during election night. Stay updated @BBCNewsUS.
The world now knows more about the #ElectoralCollege than they want to know, and are scratching their heads just like most Americans.
The right of return is a final status issue, but #AbuMazen is subtly preparing his people for compromise if/when there are negotiations.
An irony about the difficult #Benghazi response is the U.S. had military forces in #Libya until 1970. They left once #Qaddafi took power.
An @africom challenge is a dearth of regional countries willing, stable and democratic enough to host U.S. forces. http://t.co/zK77uR4b
Good analysis @JoshRogin: if @SenatorMenendez moves up Hill leadership ladder as @RosLehtinen moves on, brake will remain on #Cuba policy.
While #Romney mumbles, @JebBush nailed it. Given more extreme weather events, we need effective response at all levels, not just one.
Reform in #Bahrain is a long-term proposition, but the #BICI report is a year old. It's time to remind #Manama what it committed to do.
The U.S. keeps lowering the bar on #Bahrain. There is no longer encouragement for political reform, only the need for meaningful dialogue.
Calling the #Syrian opposition a "continental congress" is fanciful. Unlike 1776, the King is defending his throne. http://t.co/FUc5eZwi
The fat lady sings and the music dies for the #Iranian national symphony, victim of a sanction score. http://t.co/LkFIbS4X
#HurricaneSandy damaged New Jersey, but also #Romney's prospects. The effective #FEMA response has blown a hole in his campaign narrative.
#FEMA ,a brigade-size federal agency, is too small to be anyone's poster child of "big government." http://t.co/RmeDipjA
Government joins the debate over #WenJiabao's family finances outside #China while blocking the story inside China. http://t.co/BTww3kJD
In MA, #ScottBrown has an existing statewide network. The only other person who does is #DevalPatrick. Does he jump to the Senate?
#ElizabethWarren's election probably dooms #JohnKerry's bid to lead @StateDept. #ScottBrown would be favored in a special election.
Through @Twitter, the public filtered the media's perception of the #2012debates rather than the other way around. http://t.co/p8eMcwUB
We have yet to answer the Rumsfeld question regarding drones: are we creating more extremists than we are killing? aphttp://wapo.st/RxVDa1
So many candidates, political operatives, pollsters, PACers and media are descending on battleground state Ohio, could it possibly sink?
Good answer from @StateDept spokeswoman #ToriaNuland regarding #Russian views of U.S. human rights record: "This country is an open book."
If #Russian lawmakers want to engage in a genuine discussion of human rights, the U.S. should welcome that debate. http://t.co/9E7jB85i
Final verdict: #Romney escapes with few points, but no damage. #Obama has all the memorable moments. #Obama the favorite with a solid win.
It appears #Romney's strategy tonight was simply to get through it with as few memorable moments as possible.
#Romney has finally found his voice while discussing #China and trade that works for us. This is his strongest moment. #LynnDebate
#Romney supports the use of any and all means to kill bad guys, including drones. Again, trying to out-Obama Obama. #LynnDebate
#Romney doesn't even pretend he has a difference with #Obama on #Afghanistan. This is becoming a rout! #LynnDebate
Summarizing #Romney's argument in the national security debate, he will carry out the #Obama foreign policy, minus #Obama. #LynnDebate
#Obama takes #Romney to school regarding overseas travel to see troops and #Israel. #LynnDebate
#Obama calls the "apology tour" the biggest whopper of the campaign. #LynnDebate
#Obama says there is a deal to be had with #Iran if they restore credibility on their nuclear program, but the clock is ticking.
So, will #Romney sit down with #Iran's pariah diplomats?
#Obama pledges #Iran will not have a bomb as long as he is president. New #Iran strategy: repeal the 22nd Amendment. #LynnDebate
#Obama admits to a horse and bayonet gap! #LynnDebate
#Obama has his strongest moment, a budget driven by strategy not politics. #LynnDebate
Bob Schieffer asks #Romney the #Reagan question. How do you lower taxes, protect defense spending and balance the budget? Reagan couldn't.
So much for America's role in the world! #LynnDebate
The debate takes a commercial break from foreign policy to deliver economic talking points. #LynnDebate
Will the right wing criticize #Obama for saying America is indispensable rather than exceptional? #LynnDebate
30 minutes in, not a major substantive disagreement between the two candidates on their foreign policies. #LynnDebate
#Romney talks about the vision thing regarding #Egypt.
#Obama has no regrets in pushing #Mubarak out of power. Now expects the new government to meet its responsibilities. #LynnDebate
#Romney rules out a military intervention in #Syria, going a step further than #Obama. #LynnDebate
#Obama beats #Romney in referencing support for #Israel and linking the economy to national security. #LynnDebate
Good retort by #Romney on #Russia regarding flexibility with #Putin. Great give and take underway.
#Obama has his #Reagan moment, criticizing #Romney for his youthful inexperience regarding foreign policy.
#Romney describes the challenge of the #MiddleEast and #terrorism well. He doesn't explain what his comprehensive strategy is. #LynnDebate
Bold prediction: At the end of the #LynnDebate, #OsamaBinLaden will still be dead, many times over.
The candidates need to discuss what #Benghazi tells us about the broader war against #AlQaeda. http://t.co/vOPIiRtg @IPDGC @thedailybeast
It would be great to have a question about #Haiti in tonight's debate given #LynnUniversity's tragic connection to the 2010 earthquake.
If talking to #Iran is "taking the bait," the only remaining options are Iranian capitulation and war, one unlikely and the other costly.
I once said to #GeorgeMcGovern, if we only knew then what we know now. He smiled and replied, "i told Nixon that!" !http://t.co/zDZfOzFP
Monday's national security debate will be even more interesting. #Iran will compete for headlines with #Libya. @IPDGC http://t.co/PqT1nbYC
The clear debate loser? The #Yankees.
The debate about #Libya continues to center on the tactic employed rather than the political agenda behind the terrorist attack. #debate
#Romney has tried to stuff too many factoids into each answer. Wrong approach in this format. #debate
#Romney has placed himself in a binder with this debate performance. Score is tied heading into the foreign policy debate. #debate
#Foreign policy only makes a cameo appearance tonight - #Libya and #Chinese pension investments. We'll wait for Monday. #debate
Kitchen sink answer by #Romney regarding #Libya. Missed opportunity. Strong rebuttal by #Obama.
Finally! Foreign policy. #debate
GM, check. Bin Laden, check, Iraq, check. #Obama working down his list. #debate
#Romney looks petty.
W. makes an appearance at the debate!
#Obama has effectively expanded the opening to address broader concerns of women.
#Romney's bullying of Candy will not work tonight. #debate
Math will be an elective under the #Romney administration. #debate
I think Romney's five point strategy had six points. Inflation! #debate
Questioner has a Perry moment -- and then recovers. #debate
Candy wins moderating contest with Lehrer!
There is no such thing as energy independence! #debates
If we have a market economy, how can government control energy prices? The U.S. remains tied to global markets that dictate energy costs.
Nice line from #Obama: #Romney one-point plan, take care of the one percent!
Pakistan's children cry #IAmMalala! but will the country listen to them and face down extremism at this defining moment? Let's hope.
The world is traveling at warp speed while #Zawahri is on foot, too far behind events to have meaningful influence. http://t.co/SnEgUyaA
Qaeda Leader Calls for More Protests Outside U.S. Embassies http://t.co/SnEgUyaA
#Ryan effectively has two closing statements, effective use of final debate minutes.
Whoa! We intervene in #Iraq and return its sovereignty, but we are going to control who flies over #Iraqi air space?
If the logic of #R2P does not apply to #Syria, then the administration should not have used it to justify intervention in #Libya.
Amen @alexgoldmark. #MoreMartha!
Biden: Our purpose in #Afghanistan was to get those who killed Americans. He is wrong to say we are leaving in 2014. Some troops will stay.
#Ryan says defense cuts are weakness. He doesn't say what we would use a larger military for.
#Biden is scoring points - never been done before - but needs to tone it down.
#Biden accuses #Ryan of having the wrong stuff!
So there are two foreign policy debates this month!
Sharp questions from Martha Raddatz. She has established the rhythm of the discussion between #Ryan and #Biden.
#Biden has moved the search for #bin Laden from the end of the earth to the gates of hell.
DoD's #AshCarter @AspenInstitute called #terrorism an enduring security problem that will require future military action but short of war.
AmbPatKennedy makes a fundamental point about #Benghazi. We cannot withdraw behind fortresses. Risk can be mitigated, but not eliminated.
From #RepLabrador's questions: Officials in possession of the same information can come to different conclusions about what it means.
@RepGosar is right #Benghazi attack was senseless, but it is unclear how it could have been prevented given limited #Libyan capabilities.
@Dennis_Kucinich is right that the #Benghazi attack was a consequence of the intervention in #Libya, but wrong to say it was unjustified.
We have #HugoChavez to tweet against for another six years although #Venezuela would be better off without him.
We'll see #Obama's "I'm not a perfect President" again! A small gift to Mitt.
The debate would not be complete without mention of #Osama bin Laden. #Obama checks that box!
#Romney's problem is if there are no cuts in the military, even back to its pre-war strength, you cannot cut taxes and balance the budget.
There is a very nice flow to the debate, allowing #Romney and #Obama to go back and forth at each other.
The first national security shot of the debate: #Obama accuses #Romney of $2 trillion in defense spending the #Pentagon has not requested.
@MittRomney accused Obama in @WSJ of a lack of resolve regarding #Libya, an odd claim given last year's successful military intervention.
To those who might see political significance in the @rydercup loss, fact is, in the modern era, no U.S. President has a winning record.
The 2012 @rydercup was about a U.S. collapse but also a tribute to the doggedness of Europe's captain #JoseMariaOlazabal.
In the end of the @rydercup, what a tribute to both #SteveStricker and #MartinKaymer that they went "make-make" on their final two putts.
#Tiger hits his approach on the 17th to the right of the pin. No one has attempted that all day. An incredibly bold shot at a vital moment.
#Europe is now in the driver seat@rydercup. If they hold on, it all goes back to #IanPoulter's final clutch putt yesterday.
The @rydercup is guaranteed to go down to the last match. Great theater and incredible pressure.
Bravo #Europe. The U.S. is still in the stronger position, but #Europe has made it very interesting! @rydercup
@steven_metz is right that #Pakistan is sensitive to public opinion but #Islamabad needs to take more responsibility for its policies.
If #Yemen admits publicly it grants approval for all drone strikes, giving them legality and  some legitimacy, why can't #Pakistan?
Gotta tip the cap to #LukeDonald and #IanPoulter. They are keeping the European hopes alive, slim as they are. @rydercup
I have never seen so many horseshoe putts in one round. You have to feel for #NicolasColsaerts. He used all the magic yesterday. @rydercup
Decisive tilt towards the U.S., making Europe's road that much tougher. The margin is becoming insurmountable. @rydercup
Questions about the #Libya attack rest first with Congress, which supports our soldiers far more than our diplomats. http://t.co/sHJeKiJ8
With the speed of the #Medinah greens, haven't seen so many putts singe holes since #Augusta. @rydercup
The @rydercup can't be any closer. The difference in the morning session is the favorable McIlroy carom off the 18th tree. Good stuff!
Great birdie chip by #RoryMcIlroy for the #Irish pairing. If they get momentum, #Furyk and #Snedeker will need to tighten their laces.
Early gamesmanship by the U.S. pays off with a par win by #Furyk and #Snedeker. Game on. @rydercup
Obama calls government control of information obsolete. #Afghanistan bans #Pakistani papers. it didn't get the memo. http://t.co/7DzU8dzp
Told @PiersMorgan the #NFL replacement refs are bad, but they got last night's touchdown call right. And the U.S. will win the #RyderCup.
We should ask tough questions about foreign aid, but the recent unrest is why aid is necessary. Success in #Egypt is a vital interest.
#Obama at #UNGA: In 2012, the notion we can control the flow of information is obsolete. No speech justifies mindless violence. @IPDGC
The idea that one guy ikeeps the world in check while #Obama runs for reelection is news to the rest of the world. http://t.co/TkB6E6TY

@DanDrezner: Americans know what happens in #Greece, #China and the #Gulf affects them, and most now have GPS to locate them on the map!
The @StateDept's lifting of the #MEK FTO designation right before #Iran's Ahmadinejad arrives for #UNGA is exquisite. http://t.co/QfgMfsuG
The American focus on the economy reflects the wider definition of foreign affairs in a globalized world. @DanDrezner http://t.co/2W11FiQ3
The Consulate attack in #Libya was likely an act of terrorism but identifying the perpetrators and motive will tell us how to respond.
If we base foreign aid on behavior and not interest as #Republicans suggest, would we stop aid to #Israel over settlements as #Bush41 did?
The insecurity in #Egypt, #Libya and #Pakistan reflect weak economies and governments. You don't cure the patient by denying medical aid.

Loved #RobertGates analogy @CSIS about #sequestration: the #BlazingSaddles sheriff who puts a gun to his own head and threatens to shoot.
Great to see #RobertGodec @StateDept nominated to be Ambassador to #Kenya. As @wikileaks revealed, he is one of our better cable writers.
The upcoming reaction to the @Charlie_Hebdo_ cartoons will tell us whether protests are driven by religious concern or anti-Americanism.
#BillBrowder's compelling account of the death of #SergeiMagnitsky @charlierose makes the case for visa restrictions for those involved.
#Burma is engagement's greatest hit. Who could have envisioned four years ago an ambassador in Rangoon and #AungSan SuuKyi in Washington?
#Romney rightly says the pathway to #MiddleEast peace is difficult, but he is wrong to suggest the status quo is stable or sustainable.
#Ryan's charge of a diminished U.S. image under #Obama is rich. Invading #Iraq in search of WMD and finding none was not exactly a plus.
Notwithstanding the uncertain state of U.S.-#Egyptian relations, the countries share key mutual interests. @IPDGC http://t.co/KYWAU50V
On #NoEasyDay and the NDA violation, the author should be held accountable through fines, employment restrictions, administrative action.

Deployment of a #Marine FAST team as is happening in #Libya is standard in response to a violent incident or increased security concerns.
Tension between a U.S. and #Israeli leader is not unprecedented. It also happened the last time #Netanyahu was prime minister.
Tension between a U.S. and #Israeli leader is not necessarily a problem. The countries' national interests overlap but are not identical.
#China is a emerging power but its consistent lack of transparency hampers its rise as the intrigue surrounding #XiJinping shows. @IPDGC

#Berlusconi making a comeback? What heavily stressed #Italy needs is a steady diet of political credibility, not political voyeurism.
In the real world, #Russia can be part of the problem in #Syria, part of the solution in #Iran and constructive in #Asia, all at once.
The U.S. wants #Russia to be more active in #Asia to help balance #China, showing how simplistic campaign foreign policy formulations are.
Will be discussing #military and #veterans issues and the 2012 election on @Hardball with #Chris Matthews with @Politico's #RogerSimon.
#Obama chiding his opponent about being new to foreign policy is risky, but his first-hand accounts of wounded warriors hammers it home.
#Obama at #DNC2012: Using the term "nation-building at home" is a creative way to bridge the old guns and butter argument.
#JoeBiden at #DNC2012: We have no intention of downsizing the American Dream.
Incredibly powerful speech by #JoeBiden, connecting domestic policy decisions to perceptions of America abroad. #DNC2012
Bill Clinton: #Obama and #HillaryClinton showing the world that politics doesn't have to be a blood sport. #DNC2012
Bill Clinton: building a world with more partners and fewer enemies. #DNC2012

The release of #NoEasyDay, a quintessential unauthorized disclosure, should help cool the over-heated political lather over leaks. Or not.

To quote @holyroodmandy, the comments of #British MP @GeorgeGalloway, and U.S. Rep @ToddAkin as well, on rape do leave us "gobsmacked."
I remember how persuasive #Ethiopian PM #MelesZenawi was in #Copenhagen in 2009, pushing the developed world to do more on #climatechange.
#Assange's description of his legal troubles as a "war against whistleblowers" is remarkable. That #Ecuador believed him is amazing.
#Ecuador is trying to make the #JulianAssange case more than it is, a question of justice in #Sweden. But for now they are stuck with him.

#Romney and #Ryan have yet to learn what #Reagan did. You cannot lower taxes and balance the budget without reducing defense spending.
The international community is seized by #Syria but more attention must be paid to #Mali before the problem becomes harder to resolve.
The National Transitional Council's performance was not perfect but it kept #Libya moving forward, which is a remarkable achievement.
The calm and sportsmanship of #Japan's coach #NorioSasaki is very impressive, what the #Olympics is about. Worthy of great respect.
What a game and what a rivalry between #Japan and the #UnitedStates. #America strikes gold again.
#HopeSolo saves! She has been the difference.
The ball movement by #Japan is sensational. The scrums at the goal mouth look more like hockey than football.
The U.S. luck runs out in the red zone. Too much open space and too many chances. U.S. needs to hang on and work the clock.
What a rush by #CarliLloyd. The 2-0 U.S. lead may be more than #Japan can overcome. #Japan is going to have to open things up even more.
No doubt the non-call on the hand ball in this #Olympic final caught the attention of #Canada. The U.S. caught a break there.
#Japan is obviously settling in and showing how potent its offense can be. Gold medal game could easily be tied except for #HopeSolo.
The United States could not ask for a better start in the gold medal game against #Japan. Early offensive domination and a 1-0 lead.
The #Syrian prime minister defects and the cracks in the #Assad regime get a little wider. The end is clear but is not yet near.
The end of the #Annan mission doesn't make external military options more viable. The potential costs still outweigh the likely benefits.
The #Annan resignation does not change the #Syrian conflict's fundamentals. It's been clear #Assad had no intention of following his plan.
What do #India and #Pakistan have in common? The need for effective regulation of their respective electrical grid. http://t.co/8I0jbQwE
#India is an emerging power but its #blackout underscores how fragile its infrastructure is and how far it still needs to develop. @IPDGC
@MittRomney may not see value in a peace process now but he would quickly recognize its importance to his regional policy as President.
#NewYork's Ray Kelly at #ASF2012: we should close the gun loophole that puts automatic weapons in the hands of young killers like #Aurora.
AmbassadorSherryRehman at #ASF2012: the use of drones in FATA have helped reduce terror threat, but are now yielding diminishing returns.
AmbassadorSherryRehman at #ASF2012: #Pakistan needs a partnership. It can't mop up insurgent challenge alone as others leave the region.
Doug Lute at #ASF2012, Pakistan's hedging strategy in supporting the Taliban is out of date. Taliban is now a threat to #Pakistan itself.
Karl Eikenberry at #ASF2012: in U.S. relations with #Pakistan, the urgent has always trumped the strategic.
There are more Al Qaeda fighters in #Yemen than in #Afghanistan. #Yemeni government is stepping up to the challenge. #AspenSecurityForum
#AspenSecurityForum: Admiral McRaven acknowledged the the #BinLaden raid was a "little more sporty" than the other raids that night.
The #Senate bill to establish voluntary standards to improve critical infrastructure #cyber security standards is needed given the threat.
In the #ArabAwakening, dictators have learned from their fallen comrades. #Qaddafi did not put his "survival weapons" on line. #Assad has.
#Australian FM Bob Carr linked American power and a budget deal in his talk with @MittRomney. This may be news to members of Congress.
#Russia could have sent #Assad a clear message that his time is up. Instead, he'll interpret the veto as a green light to go for broke.
The attack on #Assad's inner circle may not by itself be a tipping point, but lots of interested parties are reassessing because of it.
Making @katiecouric the face of #Iraq's electrical shortage is also a subtle reminder the U.S. left this unresolved. http://t.co/KxV4OL14

The hesitation in saying "sorry" for the deaths of 24 #Pakistani soldiers cost the Pentagon $100M. The U.S. strategic cost is much more.
@BobbyJindal sees #healthcare as an #AmericanDream. Isn't it a basic right? Oh, too European, like we got rid of all that 236 years ago?
The agreement reached by the world powers is a good action plan on paper, but the parties in #Syria are unlikely to actually follow it.
While key players in the #Syrian drama meet this weekend to plan #Assad's political funeral, a complicating factor is his refusal to die.
#Paraguay deposes its president through a constitutional coup and the U.S. response is   "Gee, that was quick." Coups tend to be that way.
In most cases, the appropriate remedy for serious leaks is administrative action. The #DNI is on the right track. http://t.co/UjeIXb72
What will be important to #Egyptian President-elect #Morsi is getting a parliament he can work with and a constitution he can live with.
Instead of leading a vital democratic institution, #Pakistan now has a Supreme Court Chief Justice acting like a political party boss.
There is an object lesson for #Syria in #Egypt. Pushing aside the dictator is only one step. Transforming the system is really hard.
While @SaraKhorshid is mostly right, the basic question is whether #Egypt has the will to create a true democracy. http://t.co/IcQo1aCS
Failure is not only an option with the #Iran talks in #Moscow, it is the likely outcome. Neither side wants to give something up first.
Given the #Egyptian military power grab, the U.S. has no choice as @SenatorLeahy suggested last week but to suspend military assistance.
How do leaks happen? More people have information and journalists know how to reach them. @washingtonpost http://t.co/4wsgsgXB @IPDGC

#Syria's transition, a slow-motion tragedy, will grind on for months or longer. My latest column @BBCNews. http://t.co/sHl2RcaM @IPDGC
#Egypt already has a full plate. The predictable turmoil following the #Mubarak verdict only makes conducting a fair election harder.
The #Mubarak verdict speaks for itself, but it might have been better to hold its announcement until after the #Egyptian elections.
There are reasons to oppose a unilateral path to a #Palestinian state but #Gaza is a weak argument. Statehood includes self-determination.
Talked #Syria and the campaign @Hardball @MSNBC. Arming the opposition - and who - sounds good on the stump, but is not sound policy.
It is hard to believe that the last time #AungSanSuuKyi traveled outside #Burma, the Soviet Union still existed.
An agreement on #Iran's nuclear program is more likely in 2013 than 2012. Time favors all sides. My analysis @BBCNews http://t.co/xCHHatk7

A #Morsi-#Shafiq runoff would represent a contest between two of #Egypt's strongest institutions, the #MuslimBrotherhood and the military.
The U.S. is angry over the #Afridi verdict but bears some responsibility. We outed him without thinking through how #Pakistan would react.
Political realities may limit what all sides of the #Iran nuclear question can do and accept. A breakthrough may have to wait until 2013.
Joined @NIACouncil discussion on #Baghdad talks. This is a real diplomatic process that can develop if it becomes a real negotiation.
The U.S. says there is no basis to hold #ShakilAfridi. #Israel says the same thing about #JonathanPollard. Espionage is a messy business.
While convicting #ShakilAfridi who helped find #BinLaden, we're reminded #Pakistan has yet to explain who helped him hide for so long.
#Pakistan is still embarrassed by the #BinLaden operation and #ShakilAfridi is a useful political target. It will take time to resolve.
The U.S. should seek the release of #ShakilAfridi for supporting the #BinLaden operation. but to #Pakistan this is salt in an open wound.
#Iran and the U.S. have had few constructive interactions since axis of evil. Even small problems have been big deals. This will be hard.
There is a diplomatic opening with #Iran, but talks face major obstacles. After 30 years of tension, we don't know each other very well.
#Pakistan's decision to block #Twitter is another sign of the civilian government's weakness. It literally cannot afford such intolerance.
When #AlMegrahi was released by #Scotland on humanitarian grounds in 2009, who would have thought he would outlive #Qaddafi, his patron?
While military action could buy time, #Iran's likely response is to actually build a nuclear weapon, the very thing we want to avoid.
The threat of military action must be credible, but a bright red line could impede a diplomatic solution with #Iran. http://t.co/pqC6fDab

As discussed @TheTakeaway, as U.S. diplomats met #Chen and #Chinese officials offered a student visa, a possible solution emerges. @IPDGC
The intense limelight on #China will help #ChenGuangcheng, but as @CurrentSpitzer suggested, Chen's support network will be at risk.
Discussed the #Chen case @NowWithAlex @MSNBC. The #publicdiplomacy fallout will be on perceptions of human rights in #China. @IPDGC

If #SouthAfrica and #SouthKorea had the same election law as #Egypt, history would have lost peacemakers #NelsonMandela and #KimDaeJung.

Yesterday we were a weak and small country, said #KimJongEun at the #DPRK party. Today we are weak and small and a billion dollars poorer.
The #Ayatollah says having an actual nuclear bomb is a sin. That statement doesn't preclude knowing how to build one. http://t.co/LtTbhgJq
The #DPRK's decision to launch a missile continues its unbroken record of bad decisions. Its prompt admission of failure is quite unusual.
Given #NorthKorea's determination to launch come what may, a test failure was the least bad result. But the situation is far from over.
#KimJongUn has a new title but still no experience. He will show his bona fides with the launch at the expense of what the #DPRK needs.
British PM #DavidCameron is right. #Assad must face a day or reckoning but that day is not imminent. This tragedy will unfold over months.
Looking forward to joining @NickKristof on @NowWithAlex @MSNBC to discuss #Syria, #NorthKorea and other #foreignpolicy matters. @IPDGC

#NorthKorea's gesture is positive, but dialoge will inevitably hit a familiar wall. Pyongyang is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons.
#NorthKorea's suspension of nuclear tests should lead to the serious dialogue with the U.S. it wants and the food assistance it needs.

The leadership transition may be over as #NorthKorea and the U.S. prepare to pick up where they left off before KimJongIl's death.
A sophisticated move by the #ArabLeague to request #UN peacekeepers, return to the Security Council and put pressure back on #Russia.
The #Pakistani Supreme Court, a vital pillar of government accountability, risks turning into a political kingmaker, not its assigned role.
In contrast to transitions today in the #MiddleEast, a revolution gone wrong 33 years ago imposed profound costs on the people of #Iran.
The #Egyptian military government's use of the word "conspiracies" sounds like the old playbook and suggests more activist arrests.

#Mitt loves shipbuilding. Mitt loves space. Mitt promises to reduce taxes and the deficit. Unclear how he does all that. Reagan couldn't.
The problem with #Santorum's answer on #Iran is that a military strike makes an Iranian nuclear weapon inevitable. #FLdebate.
News flash: @RonPaul declares that the Cold War is over. This is news to the others on the #FLdebate stage.
I think #Newt promised #Fidel will die on his watch. Good luck with that. Eleven presidents and counting have hoped for the same thing.
The seating of #Egypt's elected parliament is the most meaningful political development of the past 12 months, but it's only a beginning.
#Kenyan leaders can't credibly object to today's #ICC indictments for crimes against humanity since they requested the probe in 2009.
The fact that women comprise only one percent of #Egypt's new parliament shows the difficulty of building an inclusive political system.
If @USEmbassyDamascus is forced to suspend operations, kudos to Ambassador #RobertFord for his courage and support to the #Syrian people.
New military action against the #Kachin reminds how far #Burma has to go to achieve genuine reform. Not there yet. http://t.co/j8ydu9xi
#Newt would move half of #DHS to Texas to control the border. So much for securing airports, coastal waters and disaster response.
If #Chins considers #ZhuYufu's poetry subversive, no amount of #publicdiplomacy can compensate. its global #softpower will be limited.

A compelling question by @sebastianjunger: why a double-standard in how we treat living and dead #Taliban fighters? http://t.co/QZ8UiqdU
Suggested to @AlexWitt on @MSNBC confrontation with #Iran has not reached a tipping point. Both sides see their strategies as working.
Lots of questions remain in the developing relationship between the U.S. and #Burma, like when will we formally refer to it as #Myanmar?
The swift U.S. move after months of steady progress to restore full relations with #Burma is the diplomatic equivalent of speed dating.
The U.S. and #Iran do need a crisis exit ramp, but to avoid a collision, one has to be built. None exist now.  http://t.co/LOvGYC2N #cnn
That Congress keeps #Guantanamo open is bad strategy. That it blocks the release of detainees who no longer threaten the U.S. is injustice.
The defiant tone and incredulous substance of #Assad's speech suggest he will fall eventually, but many Syrians will die before he does.
If #Iran views #AmirMirzaeiHekmati as a political pawn, he could be released at a point; if in ideological terms, he is in grave danger.
The case against #AmirMirzaeiHekmati reflects #Iran's extremist narrative. His service in the #GreatSatan's military corrupted the Earth.
After Presidents #Chavez and #Ahmadinejad trade perspectives on sulfur and the #GreatSatan, it's unclear what else is on the agenda.
In barely a month, #KimJongUn has gone from future leader to supreme commander to genius among geniuses. Talk about grade inflation.
#Iran is dangerous, but contrary to @RickSantorum's suggestion on @MeetThePress, Iran is not suicidal. A weakening Iran can be contained.
#Internet access is not a human right, but government cannot deny people their #freedom to connect if it's available. http://t.co/Z0znjZCX
The nature of warfare is changing. Future conflicts will emphasize employing air, sea and cyber forces, with fewer boots on the ground.
Even with expected #Pentagon budget cuts, we will retain broad, deep and decisive military advantages over every country on earth.
The #Pentagon's two major regional conflict scenario was never about strategy. It set a basis for budget and force structure planning.
#Iran's threats must be viewed in economic more than military terms. They are (successfully) making the West pay for new sanctions.
@StateDept wants relations with #Pakistan to return to "normal." Unfortunately, they are normal, meaning strained. They need to be better.
If protecting civilians is central to modern warfare, we ignore civilian casualties on the battlefield at our peril. http://t.co/xx1JEbf0
The #Afghanistan conflict is being fought on both sides of its border with #Pakistan. The potential negotiation must mirror that reality.
The #Taliban office gives negotiators an address, but it remains unclear how much of the insurgency is committed to the process.
The #Taliban decision to open an office in #Qatar is a signal of a potential willingness to negotiate, but questions and obstacles remain.
After two lengthy wars, the U.S. must employ significant military force at reduced cost. #Defense cuts will force strategic adjustments.
With likely defense cuts, the U.S. will have sufficient ground forces to fight one major war at a time, but not two. http://t.co/pGwWtygk
The U.S. in 2012 must prove that the promotion of #democracy is as important as its other policy priorities. #Egypt will be the test.
The pillars of U.S. policy in the #MiddleEast are the #peace process, #nonproliferation, #counterterrorism, #energy and #democracy.
Agree with @FreedomHouseDC: The #Egyptian military, shutting down #democracy NGOs, has hijacked the revolution. http://t.co/r7zmd2Yp
In an #Egyptian democracy, the military should be subject to parliamentary oversight. The U.S. should stipulate this with future aid.
The #Egyptian military has not opened its books to outside oversight since 1952. In a democracy, no ministry should have private accounts.
How urgent is the need for democracy in #Egypt? The Egyptian military provides slush funds to prop up the economy. http://t.co/rpVrwR88

On this day, a wish for #peace, never easy to nurture, achieve and sustain, but it should be our collective hope throughout the year.
A remarkable year that began with the demand for reform in #Tunisia and #Egypt is ending with a comparable demand for change in #Russia.
#Pakistan demanded an apology followings the death of 24 of its soldiers. We expressed regret. The difference has policy implications.
The United States declined to offer condolences to #NorthKorea. The North Korean people are mourning, but #KimJongIl did them no favors.
America has no trouble communicating. When it avoids words, like the C-word for #NorthKorea and the A-word for #Pakistan, that says a lot.
Given #iraq's self-inflicted and ill-timed political crisis, today's attacks are a reminder of the dangers of playing with sectarian fire.
Looking forward to discussion of the year in foreign policy with #TimFarley @MorningBriefing on @SiriusXM Radio.
In #Somalia, rather than engaging #Shebab, the U.S. may try to deny them access to @twitter, a suspect strategy. http://t.co/ZmFhUqGO

Talked with @jennafnc @foxnews about 2011, a year of falling #dictators. The #Arab transitions are encouraging but they will be bumpy.
Given its violent crackdown, the #Egyptian military's loss of political stature will be a gain for civilian-led democratic institutions.
The #Egyptian military's pursuit of its own political self-interest comes at the expense of its relationship with the Egyptian people.
Talked #NorthKorea with @JoeNBC. What an inheritance for this twenty-something leader: a country, criminal syndicate and nuclear weapons.
The transfer of power to #KimJongUn is underway in #NorthKorea. There may be some provocations for a while as he looks to prove himself.
If #NorthKorea were a normal country, the death of #KimJongIl might open the door to a #PyongyangSpring. But it is not a normal country.
Few people can say they changed the world. #VaclevHavel was one of those people who created the #Europe we have today.
Will be Up with @chrislhayes Sunday morning talking about #Iraq, which is better off without #Saddam, but accomplished at too high a cost.
Told @AJEnglish the clash between protesters and the military in #Egypt involves different visions of the path to political change.

It appears today's proceeding in the #BradleyManning #WikiLeaks case was about legal maneuvering and little else. http://t.co/Z0bjlUu4
Thanks to the #Army's corrective action, today's hearing is about what #BradleyManning is alleged to have done, not what was done to him.
The essence of the #BradleyManning case is, if every soldier gets a vote on national security policy, the military ceases to function.
My thoughts on the conclusion of the #Iraq war @bbcnews. Despite clear accomplishments, a strategic miscalculation. http://t.co/Jxazpmnw

After the live shot of #TahrirSquare, too bad there was no question about supporting #democracy in #Egypt, #Tunisia and #Libya. #CNNdebate
We are giving away the peace in #Iraq? Having helped #Iraq gain new freedom, we must be willing to respect Iraq's sovereignty. #CNNdebate
Congratulations to #HermanCain. A simple, cogent and correct statement. Cybersecurity is a compelling national security threat. #CNNdebate
#Syria is attacking its people with tanks, not planes. A no-fly zone means we are committing to militarily eliminate the #Assad regime.
#Newt appropriately said our actions must reflect our values, but no one advanced a realistic position that gets us to immigration reform.
#RickPerry says he will "shut down" our borders within 12 months. That will take care of the economy. It will cease to exist.
If we are sending money and power to #China, then why extend the #Bush tax cuts which leaves less money to invest in our national security?
#JonHuntsman is right that economic policy has to drive national security in the foreseeable future, not defense spending. #CNNdebate
#MittRomney is being dishonest. If he is so concerned about cutting defense programs, he has to talk about raising revenues. #CNNdebate
A good question by #PaulWolfowitz and good answer by #RickSantorum. #PEPFAR is a successful program that has cut HIV/AIDS rates overseas.
Replace the regime in #Iran? Good idea, but the nuclear program is attached to Iranian nationalism and popular with the Iranian people.
If #Iran has its nuclear program in 40 places, there is no credible plan to knock it out. #CNNdebate
#Romney is reiterating the #Obama strategy in #Afghanistan. Right out of the 2009 speech at West Point.
The money invested in #Pakistan is to strengthen its government to be able to deal with extremists within its borders. #Bachman is right.
Our intelligence capability has gone down hill? Then how did we find #BinLaden? Outstanding work by the intelligence community. #CNNdebate
Good for #JonHuntsman to defend the reputation of the United States around the world and its importance to our security. #CNNdebate
#Abdulmutallab was tried and convicted in a U.S. court of law. During a successful interrogation, he provided a great deal of intelligence.

#Egypt has it backwards. Rather than the cabinet stepping down, the military should step back and commit itself to civilian rule.
By taking time to patiently build a case against #SaifAlIslam, #Libya can best establish its credibility and respect for the rule of law.
Some say the #Supercommittee failure is good news, but it is a serious blow internationally to our political credibility. @carlislepolicy
#SaifAlIslam has a right a fair trial and #Libya must demonstrate to the #ICC that it has the capacity to provide true justice.
Given his most recent foreign policy foray, #MullahOmar will be President of #Libya before #HermanCain is President of the United States.
#HermanCain would be better off simply saying, "I don't have a foreign policy" than trying to pretend he knows anything about the world.
#China's criticism of the #Marine presence in #Australia has little merit. Its own intimidating tactics over the #SouthChinaSea backfired.
As a public service to #HermanCain who admits he struggles with the facts on #Libya. The world is a better place without #Qaddafi. Period.
#HermanCain turned himself into a pretzel to avoid agreeing with #Obama on #Libya. He should have just said it's good #Qaddafi is gone.
King Abdullah of #Jordan describes #Assad as the driver of a political system that steers #Syria and resists change. http://t.co/wFk63rjc
A history lesson for #MittRomney. If #Iran goes nuclear, who is responsible? Try the #Eisenhower administration under Atoms for Peace.
#MicheleBachman believes torture is effective, but a new book by former #FBI agent #AliSoufan explains why it isn't and what works better.
If #RickPerry intends to defend torture until he dies, we wish him a long life but he's not qualified to be President. Fugetaboutit!
It took longer than it should have, but the #ArabLeague has taken an important political step. Next up is more economic isolation.

The @Penn_State Board has taken decisive action. Now it's vital to keep talking with the student body. They too have been victimized.
Taking a page from #HermanCain, #BasharAlAssad will release a statement saying he doesn't remember killing 3,000 people. Did not happen.
#HermanCain is channeling #BasharAlAssad. Saying a "machine" is out to get me sounds a lot like all these protesters are terrorists.
Talked tonight with students @PSUCollegeofCom. They are troubled by what has happened, but determined not to let it define @Penn_State.
The nuclear issue can be resolved if #Iran chooses. It tends not to listen to good advice and its best friend, Syria, has the same problem.
#Ahmadinejad can throw stones at the #IAEA, but #Iran has yet to explain actions that are inconsistent with a peaceful nuclear program.
For a few years it has been clear #Iran would tiptoe up to the line where it could build a weapon if it chooses. This was inevitable.
Principled political compromise is a national security imperative. If #Congress does not function, our power and influence are diminished.
In 2012, two numbers will collide, today's 91% disapproval rate of Congress and its 75-98% incumbent reelection rate of the past 25 years.
#Congress wants to cut spending, can't do it, forms a committee to do it, expects it to fail and now conspires to undo its own mandate.
The loss of faith in the Oslo process is understandable but it is hard to see how #Palestinians gain from abandoning the two-state solution.
Told @PalestineCenter audience whatever political leverage the #PA gains from its current course only has value inside the peace process.
Some in #China, says former #DNI Blair, see from the #ArabSpring protests the resilience of democracies over autocracies. @carlislepolicy
Former #DNI Blair in @DickinsonCol speech said #China will probably develop a more representative government over time. @carlislepolicy
It's time to put specific #Obama parameters on the table and tell the #Israelis and #Palestinians to come back only when they are serious.
Worst of all worlds. The U.S. can't budge this #Israeli government and is blamed by the #Palestinians for their own refusal to negotiate.
There is no floor in the peace process right now as the #Palestinians pursue their UN gambit and the #Israelis announce more construction.
The peace process is now basically reduced to the United States repeating to both the #Israelis and #Palestinians, "That is not helpful."
#Syria says it has reached a deal with the Arab League to end months of unrest. The basic question is, do the Syrian people get a vote?
A tribute to President #RozaOtunbayeva for beginning the process that will lead to a peaceful transfer of power in #Kyrgyzstan.
The #MadridProcess just had a birthday, but with the gap between the #Palestinians and #Israelis, this will not be a year to celebrate.
We should have just ignored the #UNESCO vote. Since the law doesn't allow that, we end up with self-inflicted diplomatic pain and no gain.
We were not late intervening in #Libya, but downplaying our role reduced the international bounce from its success. http://t.co/G85IeFmc
Lemme see, @MicheleBachman told @ABC/this-week she preferred a known dictator in #Libya to an unknown elected leader. Back to the '80s!
Back to the future. With the end of the #Iraq mission, the U.S. restores the kind of troop rotations to #Kuwait that existed before 2003.
#Seif will do anything to avoid a return to #Libya. He belongs at the #ICC, but I bet he follows the money rather than go to #TheHague.
#LuisMorenoOcampo's announcement encourages #Qaddafi's son Seif to surrender and warns #Libya's neighbors to enforce the #ICC indictment.
Even #Bahrain decided after trying protesters, their "terrorists", in military courts it was better to have civilian and military justice.
The #Republican push for military only trials of terrorism suspects is music to autocratic governments. They will be happy to follow suit.
#Libya needs an effective and responsible government. Being transparent and accountable about how #Qaddafi died is a good place to start.
A secret burial is the perfect ending for a brutal megalomaniac like #Qaddafi. His execution is a troubling beginning for a new #Libya.
#Obama is right that there was a recipe for success in #Libya. But #Russia and #China do not want it to become a model for future action.
This is an important day for #Tunisia, but elections are a means to an end, a functioning democratic government serving all its citizens.
What we see is the start of a post-conflict relationship with #Iraq. Both countries must decide what to do with it after the troops leave.
We spend a trillion liberating #Iraq. We spend a billion liberating #Libya. I guess #Romney's campaign feels we didn't spend enough.
#Romney's campaign says #Qaddafi's fall does not validate #Obama's approach to #Libya. What was missing? Chest thumping is not a strategy.
The bloody image of #Qaddafi sends a message to others in the region who refuse to reform. My thoughts @BBCNews. http://t.co/1qDbmRCO
#Qaddafi's capture or death should help #Libya avoid a lengthy and destructive insurgency, but it still faces huge political challenges.
#MujahedeenKhalq would hardly do the #Iranian regime a favor and plot against the #Saudi ambassador to the U.S. This claim seems bogus.
The U.S. is changing its negotiating team, but the direction of the game depends on whether #NorthKorea changes its playbook. Not likely.
#GlynDavies is an experienced diplomat and an excellent choice to replace #SteveBosworth as the lead U.S. negotiator with #NorthKorea.
#RickPerry said tonight he wants to defund the #UN, which includes the #IAEA, its nuclear watchdog. How is that in the national interest?
Appearing on NPR's Diane Rehm Show @drshow today to discuss the upcoming decision by @StateDept regarding the #KeystoneXL pipeline.
The prisoner exchange by #Israel and #Hamas could create a new opening or further complicate peace process politics. Likely the latter.
The fact that #Iran is having trouble with its nuclear program provides more time to work the problem, but there is no easy solution.
#HaroldFord said at #GWU #brokenpolitics forum the United States is still paying in lost global credibility for the debt crisis debacle.
Tear down this wall! That's exactly what Libya did today with Qaddafi's compound in Tripoli. A tremendous psychological step forward.
Great discussion on @AJEnglish. More sanctions against #Iran is the right course but it will take time to make the case internationally.
It's disconcerting that it took five years to figure out how to manage the real short-term economic impacts while pursuing long-term gains.
The trade agreements with #Korea, #Panama and #Colombia reflect the world in which we live, interdependencies that are broadly beneficial.
Discussed the assassination plot on @ToThePoint_KCRW. Could be just a couple of guys or a strategic decision by #Iran. We don't yet know.
The #Iranian assassination plot shows the rising stakes in its rivalry with #SaudiArabia. My thoughts @guardiannews. http://t.co/ob9OXrdF
Great debate on #Awlaki @carlislepolicy. Issue for my national security class @DickinsonCol: what must government share with its people?
Read my latest post @BBCNews on the 10th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan. http://t.co/tCZGxvRu @carlislepolicy
The American people have a need to know in unclassified form the process behind the #Awlaki decision. This is what transparency means.
The #Awlaki strike was legal but the administration should issue, as with an intelligence estimate, a public version of its justification.
If @MittRomney believes he can raise defense spending, cut taxes and balance the budget, he will learn what Reagan did. It can't be done.
The #Iranian Navy plans to sail along the eastern U.S. and surely needs directions. Head for #Bermuda, turn left and look for a triangle.
#Awlaki's death is another major blow to #AlQaeda. After #binLaden he was its most charismatic figure. No one on the bench to replace him.
For the U.S. to plausibly claim to support political reform in #Bahrain, the military's message right now can't be business as usual.
The U.S. again displays a serious policy disconnect, announcing arms sales to #Bahrain following grossly unfair trials against doctors.
Whether the right approach or not, there is a logic of quietly working within #Bahrain's ruling family to support those pushing for reform.
#Netanyahu says the latest construction announcement is just routine. That's actually the problem, reluctance to change business as usual.
Nick Dowling of #IDS and I write about applying the lessons of Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia to #Libya @csmonitor. http://t.co/ItBjY1VQ
The United States needs a better answer to #Palestinian statehood than a veto. See my latest post @BBCNews. http://t.co/ThCzC1Pw
Nobel Laureate #WangariMaathai asked during a town hall in #Nairobi in 2009: with all our riches, why are we poor? Quality of government.
Good point by @BBCKimGhattas. If women can vote in #SaudiArabia and run for office, they should be allowed to drive.
History occurred today in conservative #SaudiArabia as #KingAbdullah announced that women will vote in parliamentary elections in 2015.
How much better off would #Russia be if it opened up its political system to genuine competition rather than playing musical chairs? A lot.
Congress signaled it will play Russian Roulette with the FY2012 budget, meaning our stock will keep sinking in global political markets.
#Obama's words regarding international support for the Arab transition and other conflicts reinforce the #Palestinian #UN argument.
#PresidentObama rightly said there is no shortcut to negotiations, but he offered no incentive for the #Palestinians to change course.
#Ahmadinejad saw the PR benefit of the hikers' release as he heads to the #UN. The judiciary raised the price in #Iran's political market.
#Iran's announcement days ago about the hikers' release reflected a high level decision. Everything since is about process and politics.
The impact of Palestinian actions at the #UN can be managed. The damage comes if politicians retaliate by cutting this or annexing that.
Told #ROTC cadets @holy_cross there is no longer a real line between domestic and foreign policy. Both are vital to national security.
The evident decision to seek statehood at the #UNSC is another lost opportunity. The #Palestinians gain no ground while everyone loses.
Avoiding the worst case means accepting elevated #UN status for the #Palestinians and charting a path with #Israel to direct negotiations.
A #UNSC veto will be a terrible outcome for the #Palestinians, #Israel and the #U.S. Our policy now must be to avoid the worst case.
The #MiddleEast status quo will change next week. The #Palestinians will move in one of two directions. A shift in U.S. thinking is needed.
See my post on The Competing Narratives of 9/11 @carlislepolicy. http://t.co/YQlvw1y
A year ago, I challenged #Ahmadinejad to release #JoshFattal and #ShaneBauer prior to #UNGA. A year late, but he is finally delivering.
Ten years after 9/11, we need to decide how to combat violent extremism long-term, after two wars. A necessary debate. @carlislepolicy
We may be less confident as a nation after 9/11, but that's more about economic uncertainty. We do view personal security differently.
A difficult question to answer yesterday was how 9/11 changed the United States. That legacy is still being written. @carlislepolicy
The quiet dignity at #GroundZero is compelling, the interspersing of the music, now #PaulSimon, and the reading of the names.
Discussed with @BBCNews how to balance rebuilding and remembering ten years after 9/11, continuing to advance but never forgetting history.
Poignant to see the memorial wall for Engine & Ladder Co. 10 adjacent to #GroundZero, and the new tower decked in red, white and blue.
Having been in Lower Manhattan on 9/11, it is uplifting to see #GroundZero take final shape. But we'll never forget the scene a decade ago.
The U.S. won't change #Palestinian plans to force a veto at the #UN unless #Israel adjusts the negotiating posture it has held for a year.
#Iran's call for #Assad to end the crackdown reflects a fear #Syria is approaching a tipping point. Events may already be past that point.
@AprilDRyan :)
By the time Rick Perry decides that the debate on climate science is settled, all of Texas will be on fire.
Rick Santorum, the UN told the United States to intervene in #Libya? Ridiculous. The UN resolution gave the NATO operation its legitimacy.
Michelle Bachman evidently regrets that Qaddafi has been deposed as leader of #Libya? Too many questions about the #NTC?
Kudos to Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman for defending immigration. Our ability to attract people from around the world is a strength.
Jon Huntsman decries the Fortress America mentality. Mitt Romney wants to build a fence. Score one for Huntsman. We can't seal off America.
View my op ed @BBCNews: #9/11+20, developments of the past decade and what we might expect over the next ten years. http://t.co/LGbb5TS
Ten years after #9/11 we better understand the actual threat and that success requires winning ideas more than battles. @carlislepolicy
Its people broadly view #binLaden's death as a 'bad thing,' yet to its credit #Pakistan achieves a success with U.S. help against #alQaeda.
If the #NTC delays installing a new government until #Qaddafi is captured, it cedes the initiative to him, unless they know where he is.
The relationship between #Israel and #Turkey is too important to languish given how events in #Syria will impact them both so profoundly.
The #UN judged that #Israel used excessive force when boarding the #MaviMarmara. Surely #Israel is mature enough to say, "We're sorry."
The #UN affirmed the legality of the #Gaza blockade. #Turkey should pledge to cooperate with #Israel while expanding assistance to #Gaza.
The #UN Palmer report gave something meaningful to both #Israel and #Turkey. They should take advantage and move to rebuild relations.
An interesting column from DepSecNides on the value of the #StateDept budget, which supports 20 U.S. million jobs. http://t.co/Colw2c7
Read my post on #WikiLeaks @thedailybeast. The new documents increase risk for civilians who talked to U.S. diplomats. http://t.co/wIqqW1c
Like water after the hurricane, the release of more #WikiLeaks cables continues its damaging flow, again putting innocent lives at risk.
The weather forecasts, disaster plans, rescue personnel, shelters and recovery funds all come from tax dollars. Someone tell @EricCantor.
What we saw prior to and during #HurricaneIrene were engaged and competent governments in action. As citizens, this is why we pay taxes.
Tribal politics drove #Qaddafi to obtain the release of #Megrahi, from one of #Libya's largest tribes. The #TNC reads the same tea leaves.
My latest @thedailybeast column. The #NATO intervention in #Libya scored no style points, but achieved its objectives. http://t.co/35cCaJg
If #Qaddafi's #ArabLeague membership card was revoked, there is no way #Assad should still have his club privileges. No code of conduct?
With an earthquake and now a major #hurricane, all in one week, August wreaks havoc yet again on Washington's presumed quietest month.
Hey #Qaddafi, you've lost control of #Libya, what are you going to do next? I'm going to Disney World! Nah, a ride at the #ICC is better.
Reviewed #Libya with MSNBC's @maddow. The immediate security situation will depend on whether #Qaddafi plans to fight on or give it up.
The appearance of #Qaddafi son Saif Al-Islam is a blow to the #TNC's credibility. It has to demonstrate it can lead the transition.
Discussed #Libya with @WillieGeist1 on #WayTooEarly. The challenge now is to end the #Qaddafi holdout and consolidate control of #Tripoli.
Former @StateDept colleague #JeffFeltman told @GMA #Libyans want a country that is modern, secular, unified and independent.
Told @the_takeaway that the "Pottery Barn" rule does not apply. This revolution belongs to #Libya. It was not imposed from the outside.
As #TNC Ambassador Aujali just admitted in an interview, the toughest decision the #TNC faces is what to do with #Qaddafi if captured.
The #TNC must quickly demonstrate it can credibly move #Libya forward. There will be lots of jockeying as a new political order is formed.
The scenes in #Tripoli are remarkable, but as #Qaddafi's regime collapses, the #TNC will struggle to fill the void. #Libya is not #Egypt.
Former @StateDept colleague #JeffFeltman said in #Libya #Qaddafi's days are numbered. If he is indeed gone, the number may already be zero.
After scoring enough political points, a confident government now would deport the hikers. Unfortunately, that does not describe #Iran.
#JoshFattal and #ShaneBauer mistakenly crossed into #Iran, but were arrested at the border, which makes the espionage verdict spurious.
Unlike the late 1990s, the absence of a vigorous #Israeli peace camp leaves the #Netanyahu government feeling little pressure to budge.
The struggle by the U.S. and Israeli governments in 2011 to achieve a common approach to peace negotiations is reminiscent of 1998-99.
Four weeks before a potentially decisive moment in the peace process, the gap between the U.S. 'ask' and the #Israeli 'give' is striking.
The #Burmese government still lacks legitimacy after its flawed election. Nonetheless, its outreach to #AungSanSuuKyi has real meaning.
#Obama's call for #Assad to resign assumes even greater meaning when combined with the #UN panel's suggestion of crimes against humanity.
The policy shift took too long, but #Obama's statement that #Assad must go is significant. It changes the thrust of ongoing diplomacy.
#SecClinton comment on @cspan today is compelling: Budget documents are value statements, who we are as a people and what we stand for.
A new #Iraqi government televised #Saddam's trial while #Egypt's old guard has pulled the #Mubarak trial off the air. A telling contrast.
While an admirer of #Turkish FM @Ahmet_Davutoglu, we can't expect #Syrian behavior to change now. It is time to focus on the "or else."
When @GovernorPerry says he wants #Washington to be "inconsequential," does he understand the global reach of the job he is now pursuing?
The Berlin Wall was the most powerful symbol of the Cold War. It communicated what the struggle was about, which side would win, and why.
A question for a future debate: Would you raise taxes to pay for a future war? A candidate who answers no is not qualified to be President.
The characterization of heroic #Syrian protestors as 'militant Islamists' reveals the bunker mentality that now grips the #Assad regime.
Between 2007 and 2011, #Standard&Poors has had a hand in the destruction of more personal wealth than many wars.
#Saudi #KingAbdullah breaks weeks of silence within the region and openly criticizes #Assad's violent response in #Syria. Long overdue.
We have a major league political system and a minor league #Congress full of unyielding ideologues. We the people elected each one of them.
The inability of the #Cuban government to enact meaningful reform or resolve the case of #AlanGross shows how sclerotic the leadership is.
We are reminded again of the wisdom of #SouthAfrica's truth and reconciliation commission, which considered the past to guide the future.
The #Egyptian people deserve both #justice and #democracy. The danger is the #Mubarak prosecution seeks one at the expense of the other.
The #UNSC President's statement on #Syria is a major step in what is likely to be a long process of delegitimizing #BasharalAssad.
#ElliottAbrams and I have dramatically different world views, but he is right in today's @WSJ. We should say unequivocally #Assad must go.
#Iran will undoubtedly convict #JoshFattal and #ShaneBauer. A humane sentence would be release based on two years served and deportation.
@husainhaqqani Great to see you. Hope we can stay in touch and let me know how I can help close the gap between our two countries.
#StuartLevey of @CFR says financial pressure on #Iran is more effective because of #IRGC's reach across the Iranian economy. #AspenSecurity
#DanBenjamin @StateDept is concerned #alQaeda may attack countries in transition to reassert relevance to #ArabSpring. #AspenSecurity
#DavidCole at #AspenSecurity recognized the value of both civilian and military justice approaches to terrorism, but under the rule of law.
The talks with #NorthKorea were unlikely to produce a breakthrough but hopefully convinced the DPRK further provocations are a dead end.
At #AspenSecurity Forum, Ambassador @husainhaqqani stressed #Pakistan is committed to eliminate all irregular forces within its borders.

Former Director of National #Intelligence #DennisBlair estimates 3-5000 committed #AlQaeda remain around the world. #AspenSecurity
#CIA veteran #JohnMcLaughlin told the #AspenSecurity forum #Egypt is the most important #ArabSpring development. #Iran is the big loser.
The debt debate has not been framed to address how to best protect the country and economy, and commit the necessary funds. #AspenSecurity
An key issue raised at the #AspenSecurity forum is how to best sustain the real homeland security gains achieved since #9/11.
#AlQaeda's #AymanalZawahri in a video calls #BasharalAssad in #Syria the 'leader of the criminal gang.' I guess it takes one to know one.
#MikeLeiter at the #AspenSecurity Forum says #BinLaden's death and #ArabSpring have undermined #alQaeda's relevance in the Islamic world.
The #Oslo tragedy gives added meaning to our discussions here at the #AspenSecurity Forum about the struggle against violent extremism.
The question is not whether #Qaddafi is accountable to the #ICC, but who turns him in. It's better for the rule of law if #Libya does it.
#VictorCha is right in @FP_Magazine story by @joshrogin. #NorthKorea has done nothing to suggest it will denuclearize. http://t.co/4OpyKGx
The world is indeed watching. We must live within our means, but #America also has national and global interests that default would harm.
Good line by the President: The people voted for divided government, but not a dysfunctional government.
Agree with @hilango, @ojnilsen, @lrozen. #JerusalemPost editorial on implications of #Oslo represents "epic ignorance." http://t.co/BVSv5AK
#GeneralJohnShalikashvili, by personal history and temperament, was ideally suited to deal with the challenges of the post-Cold War world.
The #Oslo targets were closely linked to the ruling party. Much is unknown, but the early indications point to a narrow, home grown plot.
Discussed #Oslo bombing and shooting with @AJEnglish. The immediate arrest of a suspect will help #Norwegian authorities identify a motive.
Any dialogue with #NorthKorea still confronts dim prospects. There is no indication #Pyongyang is willing to give up its nuclear program.
The North and South Korea meeting at #ASEAN could reopen the door to engagement with #Pyongyang that was closed by the #Cheonan sinking.
Liked @pageonemovie, which shows the internal @nytimes debate about #JulianAssange, who saw himself as an activist rather than journalist.
Looking forward to my appearance today on @AJStream, talking about the ongoing challenge that is the #MiddleEast peace process.
#Egypt should allow international observers for its upcoming election, which will give the Egyptian people more confidence in the result.
#RobertBaer, after saying #Israel could attack #Iran soon, thinks we all took this war and peace stuff too seriously. http://t.co/w1ZXGad
Conservatives, still mad the #OAS backed democracy in #Honduras and not the coup, now want to save the OAS for democracy by defunding it.
What a difference 42 years makes. We came together then to put a man on the moon. Now we struggle to pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling.
Proposed national security reductions like @TomCoburn's must be driven by the long-term strategic implications, not an arbitrary number.
@TomCoburn's plan to reduce government spending shrinks the military, both people and hardware, requiring foreign policy adjustments.
Unless #DickCheney is racing to his soapbox, it's interesting @TomCoburn can propose steep #Pentagon cuts without being called unpatriotic.
#Iran is on the defensive, with its politics splintering and economy sputtering. There is still time to see if the pressure track can work.
The #ArabSpring has sufficiently complicated #Israel's strategic calculus that it is more likely to show restraint in the immediate term.
The claim #Israel will attack #Iran soon is not credible. The strategic costs, while not static, still outweigh the prospects of success.
A noble effort by the #USA, but a salute to the perseverance of #Japan, which it has showed every day since March and again today.
Unbelievable #worldcupfinal. Two heavyweights going back and forth. No quit on either side.
#NorthernIreland, with recent major wins by #GraemeMcDowell, #RoryMcIlroy and now #DarrenClarke, is the world's newest #golf superpower.
#DarrenClarke has put #NorthernIreland in position to win the third #golf major of the past five. An incredible per capita performance.
The U.S. recognition of the #Libyan rebels, joining other countries, seals #Qaddafi's fate. This is zero sum, and he will inevitably lose.
U.S. recognition of the transitional council as the legitimate #Libyan government gives them a vital political and financial lifeline.
The difference between conviction and cowardice? 2,100KM. The #ArabLeague rightly condemned #Tripoli but today gave #Damascus a free pass.
#Nietzsche said "egoism is the very essence of a noble soul." But quoting Nietzsche makes #Chavez the egotist neither noble nor a superman.
@RobAtState @OperationFree Thanks for this and the kind words this morning. PJ
Our AAA credit rating is a national security asset. If we place it at risk, then we are jeopardizing our status as a global #superpower.
Americans have a constitutional right to purchase #guns for self-defense, but not a right to arm international cartels at war with #Mexico.
#Pakistan and the U.S. are choosing words carefully. Relations are already under stress and both sides seem to want to contain the damage.
#Assad, says #SecretaryClinton, "has lost legitimacy" and "is not indispensible," an important turning of the policy corner on #Syria.
The U.S. spent a trillion liberating #Iraq, but now we can't find a few million to open enough consulates to deepen our relationship.

#Syrian protesters can't distinguish U.S. policy over four months from paragons of #democracy #China and #Russia? That says something.
Protest sign in #Syria as reported @nytimes: "To China, Russia and the United States: The people are staying, and the regime is falling."
#AmbassadorFord's trip to #Hama did more to convey support for the #Syrian people than any American action in the past four months.
Congratulations to #SouthSudan on its independence, a new nation blessed with considerable resources but challenged by profound needs.
Great to witness the swearing in of a good friend and great diplomat as the new U.S. Ambassador to #Israel, #DanShapiro.
The powerful visit of Ambassador Ford to #Hama shows the value of his ongoing presence in #Syria and knocked the regime off balance.
Of #NorthKorea, #Iran and #Texas, which does not grant guaranteed consular access to foreign inmates prior to trial? That would be Texas.
@FareedZakaria My only quibble: declaring that #Assad must go does not require military intervention. We have other tools available.
Good news that #Turkey and #Israel are working to resolve issues surrounding last year's #flotilla tragedy. This relationship is vital.
I'm amazed #MitchMcConnell is 'amazed' we would try #terror suspects in civilian courts. Listen to #JohnMcCain: it is about us, not them.
Great point @Townhall #AskObama. Foreign aid is only 1 percent of the U.S. federal budget. We get a significant return on that investment.
Listened to former boss @billclinton tell #CPNC11 access to facts creates informed citizens who can connect dots, convert truth to power.
Great session at #CPNC11, discussing combination of #newmedia spreading ideas, #oldmedia validating facts, together enhancing #democracy.
The #Palestinians and #Israelis keep finding ways to antagonize each other, leaving the #UN peace train wreck on schedule for September.
The capture, interrogation and transfer of a #Somali extremist for trial in #NewYork show we can fight terrorism under the rule of law.
#AskObama, having said #Qaddafi lost his legitimacy for attacking his people, given #Syria's crackdown, at what point does #Assad lose his?
The story about the #ISI role in the murder of journalist #SaleemShahzad is another salvo in the on-going intelligence war with #Pakistan.
As #AungSanSuuKyi travels around #Myanmar, given the hardly veiled threats against her by the regime, all we can say is so far, so good.
Auto fuel efficiency is a national security issue. An #IndependenceDay thought: buy a hybrid, save fuel, save a soldier. @auto_alliance

The #PalestinianAuthority says it is ready to shoulder the responsibilities of statehood. Why not test that at #Gaza's border crossings?
#Israel, #Egypt and the #UN should create a system that empowers the #PalestinianAuthority to be accountable for what flows into #Gaza.
#Israel must realize that no amount of public diplomacy can salvage a #Gaza policy whose political costs outweigh its security benefits.
If the #flotilla risks delegitimizing #Israel, Israel's best response is to alter its unsustainable #Gaza policy. http://t.co/EE32HUT
#Assad has decided to start a transition - in #Hama. Sacking the governor doesn't solve his problem, unless he's ready to fire himself.
#Assad said months ago unrest would not occur in #Syria, but it has. He clearly knows he has a big problem and only one true solution.
Told @alhurranews #KingMohammed of #Morocco has built enough credibility with his people to lead a reform process. #Assad has no such trust.
The #Mikati government has arrived at a fork in the road. One path means justice for #RafikHariri, the other impunity for his murderers.
The delay in the #KhaledSaid case will increase frustration that #Egyptian authorities are unwilling to confront the past and truly reform.
If #EsfandiarRahimMashaei, Iran's alleged bewitchment czar, is trying to push the clerics from power, we should ship him some pixie dust.
Old #Iran strategy: fruitcake. New strategy: #Ahmadinejad's bewitchment. Mahmoud, watch the watch. Sleepy? Turn off the centrifuges.
As #Chavez hangs out at BFF #Fidel's man cave, the #Venezuelan people have but one question. Can he who goes to #Havana stay in Havana?
Postponing the regional leader summit, which was to coincide with #Venezuela's bicentennial, says a lot about #Chavez' difficult recovery.
If @governorperry would demand consular rights for Americans as President, why has he ignored them in #Texas? A good question if he runs.
#Libya ends in one of three ways. #Qaddafi faces justice in #Tripoli (best) or #TheHague (least likely), or dies in office (most likely).
The #ICC indictment reflects the horrible choice #Qaddafi made four months ago. He thought about leaving #Libya but chose to fight instead.
The #ICC indictment of #Qaddafi is a clear statement that dictators who violently suppress the will of their people will be accountable.
#Israel wants to avoid another tragic confrontation yet demonstrate that goods will reach #Gaza. News coverage is an asset, not a liability.
#Israel is working against its own self-interest by pressuring journalists not to cover the #Gaza flotilla, clearly a newsworthy event.
The #KimberlyProcess gave #African leaders leverage to rein in #Mugabe. The #Marange diamond profits enable his brutal reign to continue.
To paraphrase Nobel laureate #WangariMaathai, #Africa, while a rich continent, is poor because it lacks good governance and accountability.
#AiWeiWei's sentence, no Tweeting for a year, underscores #China's continuing fear of social media.
A reduction by one third of U.S. troops in #Afghanistan still preserves enough capability to continue the existing strategy through 2014.
The life sentences for protesters in #Bahrain represent the government's opening statement in its promised national dialogue. Discouraging.
Told @npr @totn that saying #Assad must step aside does not inevitably lead to a military intervention. This is a false choice.
#BinLaden's death and the deficit debate suggest a steeper first year #Afghanistan troop withdrawal than was politically possible before.
As I wrote in @washingtonpost, the existing U.S. posture towards #Syria is untenable. It's time to tell Assad to go. http://t.co/dOc3Ke3
Told @alhurranews #Turkey wants zero problems with its neighbors, but now it has one with #Syria. Interesting to see how Turkey handles it.
No surprise that #AlZawahri has taken over core #AlQaeda. But the energy has moved to AQAP in #Yemen, and with it most of the danger.
Give #Vancouver credit. Its rendition of the #Canadian anthem is special. The battle for the #StanleyCup is on.
The #Olympics are great, but nothing in hockey rivals the #StanleyCup, and a Game 7 final. As a native #Bostonian, backing the #Bruins!
@JRubinBlogger Violent leaders for life are illegitimate, like #Assad, #Qaddafi, #Mugabe. #PA, #Putin are autocrats, but have broad support.
Promoting legitimate governance could be an #ObamaDoctrine, but we have to be more consistent in its application. It can't stop with #Libya.
It's odd that #Obama thinks @RepWeiner should resign, but not #Assad. Sending lewd tweets violates public service, but not killing people?
Discussed #PentagonPapers with @MarcoWerman on #TheWorld. Do not see what happened 40 years ago as analogous to #WikiLeaks. Very different.
The challenge posed by #SecretaryGates is not new. It's 20 years old. What should #NATO do? Are the resources available to keep it viable?
@PaulTalk Right, right, very wrong. I am a nice guy and fervent #redsox fan. I am no neocon.
Lively discussion @HarrisFaulkner @FoxNewsLive about why it is important to support those who are trying to transform the #MiddleEast.
Participating in @Digitas panel discussion on #ArabSpring in #NYC and how old and new media together gave protest movements new leverage.
Credible reports of #Syrian security defections suggest the #Assad regime is vulnerable. It is time for the U.S. to get off the fence.
#Qaddafi says he is prepared to die in #Tripoli. #NATO can arange that. Just deploy a big banner with an arrow that says, I'm right here.
With #Netanyahu and #Abbas uninterested in negotiations, we are going to see more border skirmishes, a dangerous new fork in the road.
While #Syria manipulates border incidents for its own purposes, #Israel's calibrated response nonetheless gives her opponents a new weapon.
Another desperate autocrat checks out #SaudiArabia's Despot Inn. Sadly for #Yemen, #Saleh leaves behind all the makings of a civil war.
#PresidentSaleh has chosen to literally fight reform rather than respect it. It's a losing battle for Saleh, and tragic for #Yemen.
In #Syria, #Assad's legitimacy is going, going...but the United States still struggles to say it's gone. Plenty of final straws available.
In #Iraq, the #MahdiArmy can express itself, but not activists. #Freedom is still a work in progress, which is why people are protesting.
Six months into the #ArabSpring, as #Assad (with Iran's help) resists reform, we need to toss caution aside and support change in #Syria.
Told an Iranian-American group that #Iran is not immune to change. A successful transition in #Egypt will add internal pressure on #Tehran.
#NorthKorea lost its own #GlobalHappiness poll to #China. #KimJongIl traveled there last week to request more happiness exports, aka food.
#Germany, swearing off nuclear power, is betting big on renewable energy. While the U.S. dithers, the #nextbigthing will wear lederhosen.
Roadmap for #Qaddafi: the trip between #Tripoli and #TheHague is 12,486km, including ferry and tolls. The #ICC is holding a room for you.
#President Zuma took a roadmap to #Tripoli today, but the right one for #Libya has #Qaddafi in the rear view mirror.
#GeneralHossCartwright is an unconventional thinker at a time of enormous change. It's not surprising the Pentagon brass ganged up on him.
#GeorgeClooney and @johnprendergast make a strong argument to increase pressure on #Sudan given attack on #Abyei. http://wapo.st/mIjVxE
Given #KimJongIl's economic record, there is only one way #NorthKorea becomes strong and prosperous ever, much less in 2012. Term limits.
#HuJintao says #KimJongIl will give "top priority to improving people's lives." It's unclear if this pledge extends beyond the Kim family.
After the military withdraws, the U.S. will need to continue to build #Afghan and #Pakistani institutions. That process will take a decade.
The plan is to get the military out of #Afghanistan over three years. We need to follow it, especially ramping up political negotiations.
Long-term stability in #SouthAsia requires effective action in both #Afghanistan and #Pakistan. We learned this lesson over the past decade.
The #House attempt to legislate an accelerated military withdrawal from #Afghanistan may have political appeal, but has no strategic logic.
Justice has been delayed, but #RatkoMladic's arrest is a major step forward for #Serbia. He ran out of hiding places and protectors.
Balanced story on #WikiLeaks by @frontlinepbs. Sobering that #Assange had to be convinced to redact names of ordinary civilians from cables.
#ManalAlSherif is now in jail in #SaudiArabia for driving while female - #DWF. The #Saudis call it a sin. We should call it discrimination.
The #ArabSpring started with a single act of defiance. It is being sustained by similar acts of courage, including a female #Saudi driver.
The question for the United States is, are there political consequences for a leader like #Saleh who has become a clear obstacle to change?
The third time is hardly a charm for #PresidentSaleh of #Yemen, who refuses again to accept political reform. He has shown his true colors.
Congrats to the grads at the #UniversityOfSanFrancisco including Christopher Crowley, with honors in Media Studies and Journalism. @USFCA
It remains unclear why #Assad   still merits a chance to lead the transition in #Syria when #Qaddafi forfeited that right in #Libya.
#Obama committed the United States to supporting reformers. He was also specific about who has fallen short, particularly #Bahrain.
More than just calling on countries to stop jailing activists, #Obama must identify clear consequences, and not just in #Syria and #Libya.
#Obama should not just reaffirm the aspirations of people in the #MiddleEast. He should call out leaders who oppose the change they seek.
#HillaryClinton said that #Assad's crackdown "shows his true intentions." Yet the administration can't bring itself to say he needs to go.
Told @FoxNews the United States has long encouraged Pakistan to shift its strategic focus from #India to combatting political extremism.
#Haiti did something truly historic today, the peaceful transfer of power to an opposition party. But it underscores how fragile Haiti is.
#GeorgeMitchell's departure is a telling sign that there are no immediate prospects to advance #Israeli-#Palestinian negotiations.
#DavidHale is a great diplomat and is very experienced as a #MiddleEast peace negotiator. But he faces a steep hill as acting U.S. envoy.
Discussed the role of new and old media in light of #WikiLeaks in a panel @Miller_Center at #UVA. The old media still matters!
An advisor to #PresidentAssad says #Syria has passed "the most dangerous moment." The danger to Assad is reform, and a reformer he is not.
A telling image of #binLaden: the man who would be #Caliph ends up a prisoner in the #Pakistan compound that shielded him, watching TV.
As a #golfer, it is hard to believe that #Spain's #SeveBallesteros is gone. If he was in the hunt for a major, no shot was impossible.
As good friend #RobertHormats wrote in #ThePriceOfLiberty, our wars in #Afghanistan and #Iraq are the first fought without raising taxes.
#SecGates said today that #defense spending does not increase the #deficit. He's right about the core budget, but wrong about war funding.
The doubters of #binLaden's demise do not include #alQaeda, which acknowledged his death today. This seems to end questions about a photo.
Congratulations to @AJEnglish for winning the #ColumbiaJournalismAward for its coverage of the ongoing #MiddleEast transformation.
There is no surprise that #alQaeda looked at the U.S. rail system as a target in light of attacks in #Madrid in 2004 and #London in 2005.
Recommend piece @washingtonpost by @vali_nasr. #Pakistan must shift its foreign policy away from jihadist adventurism. http://wapo.st/loCsVX
Told @oreillyfactor that #Pakistan has taken action against extremists, but that its counterterrorism cooperation needs to get better.
Appeared on @maddow discussing #binLaden. #Obama is right. A photo  release is most likely to inflame, not resolve any lingering debate.
Told @BBC #binLaden photos should not be made public. We want to avoid not just a shrine, but also an iconic image that makes him a martyr.
#Pakistan evidently played an integral part in the #binLaden operation, reinforcing to the #Pakistani people why this is a shared struggle.
#AlQaeda is already diffuse, but it is likely to splinter even more, which creates potential dangers for us and vulnerabilities for them.
Does #binLaden's death matter? There are franchises around the world, but he was a major unifying force. The movement now lacks a center.
#BinLaden's death does not eliminate the threat from #alQaeda, but it is hard to see anyone playing the same organizational role he did.
#AlQaeda was having a bad year already, given its lack of relevance in current events. #OsamabinLaden's death is still a really big deal.
The death toll in #Misrata dwarfs the loss of life in #Tripoli. But the sooner #NATO fully explains what happened, the better.
Mistakes happen during conflict. If verified that #Qaddafi's grandsons died following an air attack, it could damage #NATO's credibility.
Wrote in @thedailybeast that #Assad has lost his legitimacy to lead #Syria. We should say so now, when it matters. http://thebea.st/ijen0z
Appearing on @AlJazeeraDC to discuss new U.S. national security team. Very much about shifting player positions, but maintaining continuity.
#JimmyCarter says #KimJongIl offered talks with #SouthKorea. The response should be yes, with careful planning to test DPRK seriousness.
I look forward to teaching a media and national security policy course next academic year @DickinsonCol, @PennStateLaw and @ArmyWarCollege.
With 400 people now killed by #Syrian security forces, it is no longer just bad behavior. #Assad has lost his legitimacy. We should say so.
The embarrassing #Kandahar prison escape shows how fragile #Afghan government institutions remain a decade after the U.S.-led intervention.
Only 3 of 68 detainees released over the past two years are recidivists. This hardly justifies keeping the #GTMO prison open indefinitely.
#NATO strike of leadership compound is the type of pressure that can reduce #Qaddafi's ability and appetite to attack #Libyan people.
Hear this #NewYork. @WashingtonCapitals are better and advance on pursuit of the #StanleyCup.
Agree with @JaredCohen, #Syrian people are tired of brutality. Today's violence proves that #BasharAlAssad has lost his legitimacy to lead.
#Lukashensko says #Belarus is "too democratic." Right, and #Congo, the poorest country on earth, is too wealthy. Both are badly governed.
Time favors the #Libya strategy. The combination of sanctions and the military pounding will wear #Qaddafi down, but it will take time.
Commiting #Predators to attack #Qaddafi's forces is not mission creep, but is a recognition that the existing NATO effort was not enough.
#Manning's lawyer has raised serious questions about treatment decisions made at #Quantico without foundation. This should be investigated.
The combination of a more suitable detention facility and pre-trial treatment will hopefully correct mistakes made in the #Manning case.
The #Pentagon admitted yesterday, sort of, that #BradleyManning spent more months in severe confinement at #Quantico than was appropriate.
#Assad the Dictator shot protesters. Assad the Reformer ends the emergency law and kills more protesters. Got legitimacy? Don't think so.
#Cuba installed a new generation of leadership this week. The vice president is actually older than the president. Not exactly progressive.
For all #RaulCastro's talk of reform, what we see in #Havana is a decrepit leadership celebrating mythical past glories, and little else.
#ScottGration gets sworn in today as the new U.S. Ambassador to #Kenya. Achievements in #SouthSudan are a tribute to his dedicated efforts.
A stable #Nigeria is vital to West #Africa and it has much it needs to do at home. The last thing Nigeria needs is fresh political violence.
The stated administration policy is to hold #Qaddafi accountable. We should be his travel agent only if the destination is #TheHague.
We should do whatever we can to push #Qaddafi from power. If he chooses to leave #Libya, the best outcome. We should not get in his way.
Story in @nytimes is troubling, that the U.S. is involved in an effort to move #Qaddafi beyond the reach of the #ICC. http://nyti.ms/frg9TC
We should engage #NorthKorea, but we should have new sticks at the ready, anticipating further #DPRK prevarication and belligerency.
Our public posture on #NorthKorea must be more realistic, with less emphasis on denuclearization steps #KimJongIl should take but won't.
The lesson for #KimJongIl, whose only concern is survival, is clear. There is no chance he will give up his nuclear program voluntarily.
#KimJongIl sees in #Iraq and #Libya leaders, one gone and the other under assault, whose nuclear programs never achieved deterrent status.
Denuclearization is the ideal policy goal for the #Korean peninsula, but there is no indication #NorthKorea is going to actually do it.
The solution to #Libya is political, but the United States must be committed within #NATO to apply maximum military pressure on #Qaddafi.
The administration's arm's length posture with the #NATO operation is inconsistent with its political commitment to push #Qaddafi aside.
#NATO must adapt its operations in light of #Qaddafi's changing tactics to reduce the #Libyan military's ability to attack its people.
#NATO's declaration in #Berlin that operations will continue until #Qaddafi steps aside represents a significant political commitment.
#European leaders are right to question how #NATO meets its objective with key U.S. air assets on the sidelines. Need more days like today.
The #NATO mission in #Libya must inflict enough pain on #Qaddafi's regime to stop attacks on civilians and enable a political solution.
It is important for #Europe to lead the #Libya operation. This will make NATO stronger in the long run, but only if the mission succeeds.
If the U.S. policy goal is #Qaddafi's departure, American forces must be sufficiently involved in NATO operations to make them effective.
The Defense Department, playing by its own rules, declines the #UNSpecialRapporteur an interview with an American in custody in #Quantico.
Tale of two departments: State Department invokes international #humanrights law today regarding an American in custody in #North Korea.
Congress cuts foreign aid by 14 percent while responsibilities in #Iraq, #Afghanistan and #MiddleEast are expanding. http://huff.to/eQy7Bz
Told @HuffingtonPost that the budget deal is upside down. Congress raises defense spending even as overseas commitments are being reduced.
As #AlWasat's editors face charges for publishing stories the monarchy dislikes, there is no longer even the pretense of reform in #Bahrain.
#Blogger #MaikelNabil's imprisonment for criticizing the military calls into question whether a democratic transition is underway in #Egypt.
#PresidentKarzai blames the West for the demise of the #KabulBank, despite the fact that his own brother used it as an ATM. That's rich.
The #Libyan rebels must be rational actors in this crisis. If they accept the #AU roadmap, the AU is on the hook for #Qaddafi's next move.
The #Libyan rebels should accept the #AU's ceasefire proposal, then demand that #Qaddafi step down so a democratic transition can proceed.
Watching the stretch run at the #Masters resembles the #UN.  #SouthAfrica, #Australia, #SouthKorea, #Argentina, #Britain - and #Tiger.
#Qaddafi has adjusted his tactics in #Libya. #NATO must do the same, starting with the U.S. putting its close air assets back into play.
A few #House members want to sideline the government of the world's only #superpower because they don't like #PlannedParenthood? Stunning!
The @RepPaulRyan #budget puts our efforts in #Iraq and #Afghanistan, as well as urgent challenges in #Egypt, #Yemen and #Sudan, in jeopardy.
It will be up to @StateDept and @USAID, with adequate resources, to preserve what the military has accomplished in #Iraq and #Afghanistan.
The @RepPaulRyan #budget projects that we will pull our extraordinary but overworked military out of lengthy existing overseas deployments.
The @RepPaulRyan #budget spends 20 times more on defense than international affairs over the next 10 years. This ignores the real world.
In his 2012 budget, @RepPaulRyan acknowledges the federal responsibility of a common defense, but fails to provide adequate funding for it.
Expressed confidence to #AsahiShimbun today that #Japan, with its technical acumen and determined nature, will overcome nuclear crisis.
Congressional opposition to the prosecution of terror cases in civilian courts fails to account for the negative cost to our reputation.
It would be preferable to bring terror suspects captured outside #Afghanistan and #Iraq before credible and transparent civilian courts.
The prosecution of #KhalidSheikhMohammed and others under untested military tribunals undercuts our global promotion of the rule of law.
With the detention of #AiWeiwei, #Beijing's #OlympicStadium joins the empty #Nobel chair as reminders of #China's poor human rights record.
The #Manning prosecution, done right (his pre-trial treatment included), and improved data security are the proper responses to #Wikileaks.
Another key to minimizing impact of leaks in #newmedia age, says @nytkeller, is to tighten security and access around classified material.
Thoughtful article by @nytkeller http://nyti.ms/fX3ccO about best response to #Wikileaks, starting with prosecuting those who commit leaks.
We need to know more about the #Libyan opposition, but we know all we need to know about #Qaddafi, including his connection to #PanAm103.
Four months after the start of historic change in the #MiddleEast, #AnwarAlAwlaki jumps on the bandwagon. Talk about being behind the times.
Note to #Assad: borrowing pages from the #Mubarak and #Qaddafi playbooks is not likely to work. The #Syrian people are no longer afraid.
#Assad says the unrest in #Syria is the result of an outside conspiracy. My people were tricked! Next he'll say they were drugged.
Can the tools used in #IvoryCoast - regional support, political isolation, economic pressure and military protection - work in #Libya? Yes.
There is still a fight ahead for #Abidjan, but the patient strategy in support of democratic change in #IvoryCoast will soon pay off.
#Ouattara's territorial gains in #IvoryCoast reduce #Gbagbo's ability to control and export #cocoa, his economic and political lifeline.
A #NationalSecurityBudget would better support integrated strategies in places like #Iraq. Agencies would have to live within their means.
A #NationalSecurityBudget would cap overall spending for #defense, #homeland security, #veterans affairs, #diplomacy and #development.
The #F-35 is a good airplane, but we can't have a balanced budget or national security strategy unless DoD reins in its acquisition costs.
The #GAO reports $28 billion in cost overruns for the F-35 fighter. That represents twice the operating budget of the State Department.
Can we be a superpower at such an historic time without a functioning government? Just blogged @HuffingtonPost. http://huff.to/hZhg5n
Why did I say what I said about #BradleyManning's treatment? Here's how I explained it in an op ed @guardian. http://bit.ly/gDttRR
Unless #Assad moves on reforms he has avoided for a decade, the fractious #Syrian society will unite against him. May be happening already.
For #Assad, the dilemma is that meaningful sharing of power exposes the narrow basis of his Alawite government in Sunni-majority #Syria.
#Assad in #Syria is now on the same treadmill as #Saleh, #Mubarak and #BenAli before him, trying to appease protesters without ceding power.
Change in #Libya is the policy. But as discussed with @PiersMorgan, this will be accomplished by the #Libyan people. We will help.
President #Obama acknowledged removing #Qaddafi will take time, which means #NATO military operations must be sustained for some time.
President #Obama reiterated that #Qaddafi must leave power. This will be pursued using diplomatic means while protecting #Libyan people.
Told @AJEnglish that we have taken a different approach to #Libya because unlike #Egypt, #Qaddafi ordered his military to attack his people.
Discussed #Libya today on #BBCHardTalk. #ArabSpring might have stopped in its tracks without response to #Qaddafi's attacks on his people.
The U.S. and international community are protecting the #Libyan people from #Qaddafi, but the future is theirs to make, not ours to impose.
To those worried about the cost of military operations in #Libya, it hardly rivals the $750 billion spent in #Iraq, plus the human toll.
Secretary #Gates said rightly that #Libya is not a "vital interest." But Libya affects the reform movement across the #MiddleEast, which is.
If we are patient, the pressure of the military campaign and economic sanctions will be sufficient to force #Qaddafi's exit at modest cost.
While protecting civilians, the military operation gives the #Libyan opposition time to present itself as a viable alternative to #Qaddafi.
#HASC Chairman @BuckMcKeon asks in @washingtonpost http://wapo.st/eb0jHP what the U.S. goal is for #Libya? It is the departure of #Qaddafi.
And disconnect between #nuclearsecurity imperatives from #Japan tragedy and @roslehtinen desire to cut #IAEA support. http://bit.ly/hnBjHv
Read with interest the sensible #nuclearsecurity recommendations by #MatthewBunn of #Harvard @washingtonpost http://wapo.st/fY8OUb
The crackdown against protesters has created fissures within the #Yemeni government and society, making #Saleh more vulnerable than ever.
The departure of Ambassador #CarlosPascual from #Mexico underscores the damage of #Wikileaks. All Carlos did was serve his country well.
Military action preserves the viability of #Libya's political opposition, and a path for a diplomatic solution that forces #Qaddafi out.
The military objectives in #Libya are limited, which means the impact will be limited. The use of force alone will not make #Qaddafi quit.
The #UN passed #Resolution1973, which provides both international authority and legitimacy for the military action that is unfolding now.
The #GCC and #ArabLeague statements demonstrated significant regional concern about the ongoing violence against civilians in #Libya.
Stories about a pivot in the U.S. approach to #Libya strike me as off base. The pre-conditions for international action were all met.
Debate @washingtonpost http://wapo.st/hOuQOT can't just be about #nuclear future, but promoting all #energy sources including #renewable.
In #Bahrain, the #PearlSquare monument is gone, but the underlying tensions will remain until the government commits to substantial change.
MiddleEast drama: Act I went to protesters in #Tunisia and #Egypt. In Act II, the Establishment strikes back in #Yemen, #Bahrain and #Libya.
MichaelScheuer @nonintervention says foreign policy is not about values, only material interests and security. He describes #China, not us.
Qaddafi: "It's over. The issue has been decided." True, since the international community is now committed to action that will defeat him.
#WSJ editorial page nailed it regarding troubling #Aristide return before election. The last thing #Haiti needs. http://on.wsj.com/hzL5sl
Pleased to join #Irish Ambassador #MichaelCollins in celebrating #StPatricksDay in DC. A salute to #Bantry, #Cork, my ancestral home.
It took great political courage for the #Pakistan government to find a way to resolve the Davis case despite understandable public emotion.
@LWorters I appreciate that. Say hello to the gang. PJ
I am humbled by the support and encouragement. I will keep tweeting on global issues. There is still lots to say about BFF #North Korea. :)
We worked together every day during the administration's first two years and I was pleased that Mike accepted my offer to return to State.
Mike Hammer will do a great job as my successor at State. He and I worked together 12 years ago on the NSC staff at the White House.
#AmbassadorJohnRoos spoke with #Japan's FM Matsumoto and reaffirmed that we are ready to provide support as Japan identifies specific needs.
#AmbassadorJohnRoos has moved our #USEmbassy's command center to an alternate location as a precaution given the many aftershocks in #Tokyo.
We have been in touch with the #Japanese government and we stand ready to provide whatever assistance needed in response to the #tsunami.
Discussion @emersonjoudept was wide-ranging, including April elections in #Nigeria and protection of journalists in #Russia and #Turkey.
Grateful to the #MIT #MediaLab for the chance to discuss building global communities to exchange information and views on current events.
These are not #Twitter or #Wikileaks revolutions. They belong to the people, but technology can expand and accelerate the pace of change.
Enjoyed a great Q&A with students at #BostonUniversity's #CollegeofCommunication on the #MiddleEast and the importance of a free press.
Discussed the #MiddleEast with @MarcoWerman on @pritheworld in #Boston. We will support this transformation but it belongs to the region.
Met U.S. students from the U.S. Senate Youth Program @StateDept with @usmariaotero today. Great questions on #China, #MiddleEast, #women.
Two C-130s carrying a total of 150 #Egyptian passengers are en route from Djerba, #Tunisia to Cairo as the humanitarian airlift continues.
Soon #Egypt will consider changes to its constitution. As in our country, a question to debate: why can't an #Egyptian woman be President?
If #Tahrir Square has meaning, then all #Egyptians must be able to participate in, shape and benefit from the transition, including #women.
It is shocking and disappointing that women demonstrating in #Egypt were assaulted by their own countrymen, and on #InternationalWomen'sDay.
We are grateful for Seiji #Maehara's contributions to U.S.-#Japan relations and look forward to working with the new FM Takeaki #Matsumoto.
#SecClinton spoke yesterday with Dr. Muhammad #Yunis and expressed support for the independence of the #Grameen Bank in #Bangladesh.
We congratulate the governments of #Serbia and #Kosovo for the first meeting of an #EU-facilitated dialogue since Kosovo became independent.
The #U.S. State Department has developed an updated strategy on #conflict #minerals to improve transparency in #Africa's Great Lakes region.
The #U.S. will devote $12.6M more to support refugee and migration needs resulting from unrest in the #IvoryCoast, especially for #Liberia.
#SecClinton and FM Frattini of #Italy talked about developments in #Libya and the need to build international consensus for future steps.
#SecClinton called new FM al-Araby of #Egypt today to offer congratulations and discuss regional developments and ways to support Egypt.

#SecClinton and #Egyptian PM Sharaf reviewed developments in #Libya, including U.S. and international efforts to evacuate Egyptian citizens.
#SecClinton spoke with new PM #Sharaf of #Egypt. She reaffirmed our willingness to support Egypt's democratic transition and its economy.
Two more U.S. military aircraft have arrived in Cairo with #Egyptian citizens from #Tunisia. The four flights today will carry 328 evacuees.
Four US military C-130 aircraft will ferry #Egyptian citizens from #Djerba to #Cairo today. One flight with 82 passengers has landed so far.
The Alan Gross trial in #Cuba has concluded. There is not yet a verdict. We hope he will be released and allowed to return to his family.
Two additional #US military C-130 #humanitarian flights are en route from #Djerba, #Tunisia to #Cairo, each carrying 90 #Egyptian citizens.
The #NPT turns 41 today. It has been an incredible success, a tribute to U.S. leadership and international non-proliferation cooperation.
Two #US military C-130 transports carrying 132 #Egyptian passengers on a humanitarian flight are en route from #Djerba, #Tunisia to #Cairo.
The moral bankruptcy of Laurent #Gbagbo is evident as his security forces killed women protesters and his country runs out of resources.
#SecClinton and FM #AboulGheit of #Egypt conferred today about the humanitarian situation in #Libya and the plight of international workers.
#SecClinton spoke with #German FM #Westerwelle about the Frankfurt shooting. We appreciate the outpouring of support from the German people.
#SecClinton to #Congress today: Spending for #diplomacy and #development is about national #security every bit as much as #defense spending.
#SecClinton to #Congress today: We are in competition for global influence with #China. #Diplomatic retreat would be a strategic mistake.
#SecClinton today: Assassination of #Pakistani Minister #Bhatti tragically demonstrates threat to religious minorities all around the world.
#SecClinton tells Congress today: The world is still in great need of #American leadership. But this requires ongoing resolve and resources.
#SecState tells #Congress today: Prior investment in #foreignassistance paid off in #Egypt. #Military refused to turn weapons on own people.
#SecState today: #Military cannot succeed in #Afghanistan without strong civilian partner. Budget for diplomacy and development saves money.
The protests in #Yemen are not the product of external conspiracies. President #Saleh knows better. His people deserve a better response.
We are working with other countries on travel options so roughly 30 more American citizens who have contacted us can evacuate #Libya.
#Qaddafi tells #ABCNews: All my people with me, they love me. They will die to protect me. The #Libyan people tell Qaddafi: You go first!
#Libya is jamming the coverage of news networks including #AlJazeera and #Alhurra. Things are evidently not as calm as the #Qaddafis claim.
Two different pictures are emerging in the #MiddleEast. People protest for change, while #Libya attacks and #Iran detains their opposition.
#SecClinton spoke with #EU High Rep Lady Ashton to coordinate intl efforts to pressure #Libyan govt to stop the violence against its people.
Despite #Qaddafi's hardly sober claim that the protesters are on drugs, the people of #Libya are clear-eyed in their demand for change.
It is remarkable that even before our colleague Ambassador #JonHuntsman departs #Beijing, #China has made him disappear on the #Internet.
#SecClinton talked with FM #Cannon of #Canada about #Libya and the mulilateral discussions underway at the #HumanRightsCouncil and #NATO.
A U.S. charter aircraft departed #Libya at 1:49 p.m. EDT with additional American and international citizens on board, bound for #Istanbul.
More than 300 passengers are on board the U.S.-chartered ferry from #Libya to #Malta. Additional passengers were added before departure.
The ferry carrying American and international citizens from #Libya to #Malta is finally underway. The trip will take roughly eight hours.
#SecClinton spoke with #AfricanUnion Chairperson #Ping about actions the AU can undertake regarding #Libya in light of ongoing violence.
#SecClinton conferred with #British FS @WilliamJHague about #Libya and steps the international community can take in the coming days.
#SecClinton talked with President Deby of #Chad about the current situation in #Libya and the risk to the Libyan people and the region.
The #JulianAssange rape case is a matter between #Britain and #Sweden. Notwithstanding claims to the contrary, the U.S. is not involved.
A trial date has been set for #AlanGross in #Cuba. We hope he receives a fair trial and is allowed to come home. What he did is not a crime.
The ferry departure from #Libya to #Malta is delayed due to high seas. Citizens are safe on board. It will leave when the weather permits.
#Ahmadinejad posed an interesting question today: Why do leaders act so badly against their people? He owes the Iranian people an answer.
If #NorthKorea and #Iran are in "one trench," it is a hole of their own making. But there is a way out: abide by international obligations.
The #Algerian cabinet's decision to lift the state of emergency is positive, but must be translated into expanded #freedoms and real change.
We are surprised that #Argentina has chosen not to resolve a simple dispute involving training equipment. And we still want our stuff back.
Activists meet in #Zimbabwe to discuss the implications of #Egypt and #Tunisia and end up arrested. #Mugabe did not learn the right lessons.
#SecClinton phoned #NewZealand FM #McCully to express sorrow over the #earthquake in #Christchurch. A US search and rescue team is enroute.
#SecClinton: We join the international community in strongly condemning the violence in #Libya. Time to stop this unacceptable bloodshed.

#SecClinton discussed the situation in #Bahrain with #Saudi FM Prince Saud. They agreed to support Bahrain's dialogue with all its citizens.
#SecClinton and #Italian FM #Frattini spoke this morning about the current situations in #Egypt, #Tunisia and #Libya.
#Libya continues to restrict outside communications but it cannot hide the mounting death toll as it cracks down on peaceful protesters.
#SecClinton and #UNSGBan talked tonight about international support for #Egypt and next steps regarding the #MiddleEast peace process.
The #House cuts in #ClimateChange funding are like canceling the #ark and assuring #Noah the weather forecast is wrong. Umbrella anyone?
The #House voted to ban U.S. funding for the #UN panel that deals with #ClimateChange and cut funding for the #SpecialEnvoyForClimateChange.
The #House budget severely cuts funding for #food #security as global food prices are spiking. What happened to compassionate #conservatism?
Women in #Egypt protested for change. It is a concern that women are excluded from the constitutional committee that must ensure all rights.
Governments protect banks, but in #IvoryCoast #LaurentGbagbo is breaking into them - literally - further discrediting his claim to power.
While #China negotiates with #SecClinton, it is evidently trying to make her disappear from the #Internet. This is a losing proposition.
#SecClinton spoke with #Palestinian President Abbas and #Qatari PM #HamidBinJassimAlThani about ongoing efforts to achieve #MiddleEastPeace.
#SecClinton discussed #Egypt with #Senate. U.S. will remain engaged around the world, but draconian budget cuts will make that difficult.
#SecClinton spoke today with #Bahraini FM and expressed 'deep concern' about actions of security forces against peaceful protesters.
#SecState today: U.S. will reprogram $150M so we are in a position to support #Egypt as it identifies needs during its on-going transition.
#SecClinton conferred tonight with FM #KevinRudd of #Australia on building international support for the transition to democracy in #Egypt.
Of course, there is nothing preventing #KimJongIl from opening up #NorthKorea so his people could enjoy #Clapton, and maybe get more to eat.
#KimJongIl's son attended an #EricClapton concert in Singapore? Actually, the #DearLeader himself would benefit from getting out more often.
The budget sent to #Congress for the #StateDept and #USAID is only one percent of #federalspending. Cuts will affect our #nationalsecurity.
#SecClinton and FM #Gryshchenko discussed #energysecurity, #nonproliferation cooperation and the need for more political reform in #Ukraine.
#SecClinton talked today with foreign ministers of #Portugal, #UnitedKingdom and #Germany about ongoing developments in the #MiddleEast.
#SecState sees issue of #netfreedom and #Wikileaks as false debate. Criticism not b/c Wikileaks used #Internet, but b/c people put at risk.
#SecClinton spoke with #Egyptian PM #Shafik. He welcomed support from the international community and U.S. as Egypt identifies its needs.
From #Canada, the #Dominican, #Mexico and #Venezuela, all the way to #Japan, everyone who loves #baseball welcomes spring training.
#Burma claims there is a new era, but it is up to its old tricks by threatening #AungSanSuuKyi. New suits does not a new system make.
#Valentine for the #IvoryCoast: Remember the on-going struggle to help the people of Ivory Coast achieve the democracy for which they voted.
We remember the assassination of #RafiqHariri in #Lebanon six years ago. What kind of future can there be without a commitment to justice?
#Egyptian FM #AboulGheit updated #SecClinton on the new interim government and pledged a roadmap that will describe Egypt's plans and needs.
#SecClinton discussed regional developments with #Palestinian President #Abbas. Deputy Envoy David Hale will continue dialogue this week.

#SecClinton talked with Indian External Affairs Minister #Krishna about #Egypt, his recent dialogue with #Pakistan and bilateral issues.

#SecClinton is making calls to regional and global leaders to gain a shared perspective on #Egypt, recent developments and the way forward.
#Syria restores social media one moment, then conducts a secret trial of #blogger #TalAlMallouhi. #Syria is going in the wrong direction.
#DepSecSteinberg accepted the credentials today of the new Ambassador-designate of the #IvoryCoast, nominated by President #Ouattara.
If confirmed as U.S. ambassador, #ScottGration will continue to address the challenge of #Somalia and its impact on #Kenya and the region.
Few people can say they helped make history. Cajoling #Juba and #Khartoum to support the historic referendum in #Sudan, #ScottGration did.
Unfortunately, severe budget cuts to #foreignaid contemplated by #Congress will constrain our ability to help #Yemen reduce this threat.
U.S. officials told the #HouseOfRepresentatives yesterday that #AQAP in #Yemen is now the most significant threat to the U.S. homeland.
Happy Birthday to Chris Crowley (@sanfransalty), a senior at #USF and future #journalist, a noble profession as we see daily in #Cairo.
There is a certain irony about #Iran's reaction to #Egypt. What is good for #TahrirSquare should be good for #Tehran.
The #Egyptian people will keep coming to #TahrirSquare. #Democracy means that peaceful protesters are both tolerated and protected.
We continue contact with #Pakistan to express the importance of resolving the case of a U.S. diplomat in accordance with international law.
Having been released in #Egypt earlier today, it is good to see @Ghonim back on line.
Nothing in the #UnitedKingdom report released today changes our understanding of the 2009 #Megrahi release to #Libya. It was a mistake.
The people of #SouthernSudan have made a dramatic choice - independence. The government and people of Sudan need to respect this decision.
#SecClinton today: #Egypt must come together and agree on reforms and changes in laws and regulations that lead to free and fair elections.
Secretary #Clinton today: There needs to be an orderly, expeditious transition. The people of #Egypt will be the arbiters of this process.
#SecClinton today: The transition to #democracy (in #Egypt and elsewhere) will only work if it is deliberate, inclusive and transparent.
#SecClinton today: The status quo is not sustainable; need systematic steps where voices are heard, rights respected and aspirations met.
#SecClinton today: Young people in the #MiddleEast are rightly demanding that their governments become more effective, responsive and open.
Contrary to @TelegraphNews claim, we carried forward requirement to notify #Russia about U.S.-UK nuclear cooperation from the 1991 treaty.
@TelegraphNews claims the U.S. betrayed #UK nuclear secrets as part of the negotiation of the #NewSTART treaty. One word response: Bunk!
#NewSTART entered into force today with the exchange of instruments of ratification between #SecClinton and #FMLavrov of #Russia in #Munich.
Government and opposition leaders met in #Egypt today. We encourage broader dialogue and more steps to build confidence in the transition.
@DrRandPaul says no foreign aid? The Marshall Plan created allies and market economies in #Europe, and jobs at home. Aid does that now, too.
U.S. Ambassador Phillip Carter: Sanctions are reducing the ability of Laurent #Gbagbo to "hijack a democratic process" in #CoteD'Ivoire.
We deplore the #Cuban government's intent to seek a 20-year sentence against #AlanGross. His international development work is not a crime.
Secretary #Clinton talked with Prime Minister #Papandreou of Greece today about the current situation and an orderly transition in #Egypt.
Egyptians must determine the way forward for #Egypt. Real negotiations with all interested parties, including the protesters, are needed.
#SecClinton today: There is a clear responsibility by the #Egyptian government, including the Army, to protect those threatened by attacks.
There is a concerted campaign to intimidate international journalists in #Cairo and interfere with their reporting. We condemn such actions.
The perpetrators of today's violence in #Egypt must be held accountable, and the government should tell its supporters to eschew violence.
We reiterate our call for all sides in #Egypt to show restraint and avoid violence. Egypt's path to democratic change must be peaceful.
We are concerned about detentions and attacks on news media in #Egypt. The civil society that Egypt wants to build includes a free press.
President #Obama speaking now: There must be an orderly transition in #Egypt and it must begin now. The U.S. will be a partner.
As part of our public outreach to convey support for orderly transition in #Egypt, Ambassador Scobey spoke today with Mohammed #ElBaradei.
The U.S. Embassy in #Cairo has been especially busy in the past several days with an active outreach to political and civil society reps,
We are concerned by the shutdown of #Al-Jazeera in #Egypt and arrest of its correspondents. Egypt must be open and the reporters released.
Watching #60Minutes: No evidence #WikiLeaks influenced #Tunisia. Events in Tunisia resulted from actions of Tunisian people, not outsiders.
#SecClinton in #Haiti: We will stand with the people of #Haiti. We want to see the voices and votes of the Haitian people acknowledged.
Secretary #Clinton en route to #Haiti talked with #British FM #Hague about the current situation in #Egypt and Middle East #Peace.
#SecClinton today: The government must open an inclusive national dialogue with the people of #Egypt as part of a lengthy process of reform.
#SecClinton today: U.S. supports a peaceful, orderly transition to free, fair and credible elections that lead to real democracy in #Egypt.
The #Egyptian government can't reshuffle the deck and then stand pat. President #Mubarak's words pledging reform must be followed by action.
The people of #Egypt no longer accept the status quo. They are looking to their government for a meaningful process to foster real reform.
With protesters still on the streets of #Egypt, we remain concerned about the potential for violence and again urge restraint on all sides.
As President #Obama said, ideas in #Egypt cannot be suppressed. The people want change and the government must respond to that aspiration.
As Secretary #Clinton said, deeply held grievances in #Egypt must be addressed and peacefully resolved. Violence will not make them go away.
The government and people of #Egypt face consequential choices in the coming days. We hope they choose a path of dialogue and reform.
Reform is vital to #Egypt's long-term well-being. The Egyptian government should view its people as a partner and not as a threat.
Events unfolding in #Egypt are of deep concern. Fundamental rights must be respected, violence avoided and open communications allowed.
We are concerned that communication services, including the Internet, social media and even this #tweet, are being blocked in #Egypt.
We are closely monitoring the situation in #Egypt. We continue to urge authorities to show restraint and allow peaceful protests to occur.
#SecClinton spoke this afternoon with FM Aboul Gheit of #Egypt. She encouraged restraint and dialogue, and offered U.S. support for reforms.
Ambassador Robert Ford presented his credentials to President #Assad of #Syria. He will be candid in communicating our views on key issues.
Progress in #Pakistan, and other key states, is put at risk if #Congress cuts funding for #diplomacy and #development back to FY2008 levels.
The U.S., thanks to #Kerry-Lugar-Berman, has expanded #development assistance to #Pakistan as we build a long-term strategic partnership.
Combine Pakistan's population growth with its on-going battle against violent extremism, and it is clear why the U.S. should help #Pakistan.
A new #Pew study says #Pakistan will be the most populous #Muslim country by 2030. This underscores yet again why Pakistan is important.
#PresidentChavez says he is not an enemy of #golf, as he saluted #JhonattanVegas, winner of the #BobHopeClassic. A diplomatic breakthrough!
#Egypt must handle protests peacefully and create greater political, social and economic opportunity consistent with people's aspirations.
We diminish our power if we defund #USAID as the #RepublicanStudyGroup suggests. And we put hard-fought gains in places like #Iraq at risk.
Being a superpower means applying all dimensions of power - defense, #diplomacy and #development - to a challenge. Think #Iraq for example.
The life sentence for convicted bomber #AhmedGhailani demonstrates again that civilian courts can deliver justice in #terrorism cases.
#Indonesia must hold its armed forces accountable for violations of #humanrights. We are concerned and will continue to follow this case.
The sentences issued in an #Indonesian military trial do not reflect the seriousness of the abuses of two Papuan men depicted in 2010 video.
Good news from #Afghanistan, that #PresidentKarzai will inaugurate Parliament tomorrow. This give-and-take is what #democracy is all about.
The U.S. supports the proposed month-long ban on cocoa imports from the #IvoryCoast. #LaurentGbagbo needs to get the message and step down.

The U.S. remains focused on a two-state solution and will continue to work with the parties to narrow existing differences on core issues.

#HockeyNightInCanada. Admire #Canada, but the official #Washington position: Go #Capitals, beat the #MapleLeafs.
A salute to #Nepal for transfering command of Maoist forces to a special committee. This is a major step in the Nepalese peace process.

#SecClinton called PM #Ghannouchi of #Tunisia today to encourage on-going reforms and pledged support for transition to open democracy.
The claim by the lawyer for #JulianAssange that his client could go to #Guantanamo is pure legal fantasy. Save it for the movie.

As the people of #Tunisia chart a different future, political and social stability are essential ingredients for credible elections.
Friends of #Lebanon joined Ambassador Antoine Chedid tonight in Washington to commemorate a new Congressional caucus to support Lebanon.
We do not doubt President Aristide's desire to help the people of Haiti. But today #Haiti needs to focus on its future, not its past.
This is an important period for #Haiti. What it needs is calm, not divisive actions that distract from the task of forming a new government.
The people of #Tunisia have spoken. The interim government must create a genuine transition to democracy. The United States will help.
Secretary Clinton called #Aung San Suu Kyi today and pledged to work with her to strengthen civil society and promote democracy in Burma.
#Tunisia made some important promises today, to open up to media and human rights groups. These are steps in the right direction.

We are surprised by the timing of Duvalier's visit to Haiti. It adds unpredictability at an uncertain time in Haiti's election process.
Secretary Clinton called Tunisian FM Morjane, pledged support for Tunisian people and urged broad political dialogue during transition.
Tunisia is not a Wiki revolution. The Tunisian people knew about corruption long ago. They alone are the catalysts of this unfolding drama.
RT @bencnn No one I spoke to in Tunis today mentioned twitter, facebook or wikileaks. It's all about unemployment, corruption, oppression.
Haiti will develop the North Industrial Park that will support 20,000 jobs. Counselor Cheryl Mills was in #Haiti to support this milestone.
Enjoyed my discussion with @TWC_Internships students today. Thanks for the thoughtful questions. http://go.usa.gov/rdA
Robert Ford is exactly the right person to be the new U.S. Ambassador to #Syria. He is tough, principled and skilled with a proven record.
The legal export of popcorn, chewing gum, cake sprinkles and hot sauce is not propping up the Iranian government. #Iran
We will defer to Governor Richardson's Office in New Mexico regarding all details of his North #Korea visit.
Governor Bill Richardson called Deputy Secretary Jim Steinberg last night and provided his perspective on his private visit to North Korea.
Unfortunately, North Korea is back to its old belligerent tricks. We need constructive actions, not heated rhetoric. #Korea
Richard Holbrooke's legacy is a combined military, civilian, regional and international strategy, focused on a common objective.
One lesson from Vietnam that Richard Holbrooke applied to Afghanistan and Pakistan was the need for an integrated policy.
Richard Holbrooke's five decades of government service spanned this generation's most complex foreign policy challenges.
No country believes in press freedom more than the United States. We practice what we preach. #WPFD
While Julian Assange places journalists in authoritarian societies at risk through the release of cables, we are protecting them.
U.S. looks forward to hosting World Press Freedom Day. We welcome the discussion about media in the 21st Century http://go.usa.gov/1yw #WPFD
Conspiracy theorists are at it again. The U.S. is not pulling strings in the Assange case. This is between the UK and Sweden.
The U.S. government did not write to PayPal requesting any action regarding #WikiLeaks. Not true.
Some mistakenly applaud those responsible for leaking @StateDept cables, but there is nothing laudable about endangering innocent people.
Contrary to what some are saying, @StateDept does not have a formal policy on students tweeting or posting links about #WikiLeaks.
Julian #Assange comes clean as opportunist, threatens to put others at risk to save his own hide.
One year in prison and not charged with a crime. We remember Alan Gross today and call on #Cuba to release him. 'Tis the season.
Opponents of the New #START can’t find anything wrong with the treaty, so they make things up, like a secret deal. Not true.
Calls for #SecClinton to resign are ridiculous. She has instructed diplomats to do their jobs. Nothing more, nothing less.
Diplomats collect information that shapes our policies and actions. Diplomats for all nations do the same thing.
Contrary to some #Wikileaks’ reporting, our diplomats are diplomats. They are not intelligence assets.
The people of #Haiti are at the polls today to elect a new President who will lead the effort to reconstruct the country.

It is time to ratify New #START. We have negotiated a strong treaty. We have held hearings & answered all the questions. No reason to wait.
Nothing in New #START Treaty restricts missile defense. Who says so? Our military leaders. New START enhances our national security.
The Ghailani case shows America practices what it preaches, protecting our national security through a transparent legal system.
A jury of 12 Americans convicted Ahmed Ghailani of a terrorist conspiracy. Miscarriage of justice? No, it's called the rule of law.
What we heard from Senator Richard Lugar today, encouraging senators to ratify New #START and not temporize, is true statesmanship.

President Ahmadinejad, want to show goodwill to the American people? Bring #ShaneBauer & #JoshFattal home next week when you visit the #UN.
Having released #SarahShourd, #Iran should do the same for #ShaneBauer and #JoshFattal in accordance with its legal process.
We thank the governments of #Switzerland, #Oman and others for their efforts to help secure the release of #SarahShourd.
Meetings yesterday at the White House & today at the State Department were a clear rejection of Hamas & its strategy of endless conflict.

Americans should heed our #travel warning and avoid North Korea. We only have a handful of former Presidents. http://go.usa.gov/cAO #DPRK
We appreciate that North #Korea resolved the #Gomes case. This does not allay our concerns about its broader behavior. #DPRK
President Carter did not carry a message to North #Korea.  His trip was only about the return of Aijalon #Gomes. #DPRK
We are grateful for President Carter's successful private humanitarian mission. Welcome home Aijalon #Gomes. #Korea #DPRK
North #Korea has joined #Facebook, but will it allow its citizens to belong? What is Facebook without friends?
Yesterday, contributions to the texting effort for #Pakistan (text SWAT to 50555) nearly doubled. More than $90,000 has been contributed.
#SecClinton spoke with King Abdullah of #Jordan about efforts to relaunch direct Mideast peace negotiations. More news in the next hour.

#SecClinton spoke this afternoon with President Mubarak of #Egypt about the on-going efforts to relaunch direct Mideast negotiations.
@ricksanchezcnn Combat troops are leaving but the mission in Iraq is not done. It is in transition to a long-term civilian led partnership.

The Hermit Kingdom will not change overnight, but technology once introduced can't be shut down. Just ask #Iran. #Korea
The North Korean government has joined Twitter, but is it prepared to allow its citizens to be connected as well? #Korea
We use Twitter to connect, to inform, and to debate. We welcome North #Korea to Twitter and the networked world.

The U.S. is sending food, medicine, boats and bridges to help people of #Pakistan deal with severe flooding. http://go.usa.gov/Oh1
Two employees at our embassy in #Paris detected an odor while opening a letter. Investigation revealed nothing harmful. Employees are fine.
The three hikers should be released, not held as pawns in a power game where #Iran refuses to play by the rules.
The three hikers are not spies; they are innocent Americans who wandered across an unmarked border. #Iran
Iran demands respect, but civilized nations do not treat innocent civilians the way #Iran has treated the three hikers.
Tragically, it has been a year since Josh Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd have been confined without trial in #Iran.
@random_musings An “army of peacebuilders?” Yes, we need to help more countries “be all they can be.”
@susanmorgan President Bashir must cooperate with the ICC and answer the charges against him.  Peace and justice are sides of the same coin.
#Sudan and #Chad are normalizing relations and eliminating the causes of past conflict. This will save lives in #Darfur.
In #Sudan and the region, we want to see lives saved and justice served. These imperatives are not in competition.
#SecClinton announced today that the Civilian Response Corps ranks reached 1,000 civilian responders to become an army of peacebuilders.
The United States will continue to stand with the people of #Uganda and #Somalia.
The steadfast resolve demonstrated by #Uganda is the ultimate weapon against terrorists like al-Shabaab.
Al-Shabaab has a very different vision for Africa, violence that attempts to tear down what others have built up.
The people of #Uganda were celebrating South Africa's great achievement as host of the World Cup.

The economic indicators in the West Bank are positive, thanks to a responsible government committed to peace and security.
Listening to President Abbas talking with #SecClinton today, the contrast between the West Bank and #Gaza was compelling.
One year later, the government in Tehran neither represents the will of the Iranian people nor acts in their national interest. #Iran
@chavezcandanga sings to @SecClinton? Can #Vegas be far behind? Maybe he should stay in Vegas.
#Canada assistance follows shipments from #Mexico, #Norway and the #Netherlands. We are grateful to all who have offered help. #oilspill
Thank you #Canada! Booms to help contain the oil spill should arrive in #Alabama this evening, with more on the way. #oilspill
#Sudan must stop its pattern of political repression and harassment of journalists, human rights advocates and NGOs.
We continue to raise our concerns for welfare of U.S. lawyer Peter Erlinder with Rwandan authorities. An appeal of bail denial is pending.
A quick timeout from #baseball and foreign policy. Happy birthday to my daughter Mary.
I am a #RedSox fan, but Armando Galarraga and the #Tigers showed class. The people of #Detroit and #Venezuela should be proud.
More important than Armando Galarraga’s 28-out perfect game is his grace and sportsmanship displayed since then. #baseball
Americans share a passion for #baseball with many around the world. We all recognize Armando Galarraga pitched a perfect game.
#Turkey and the U.S. share the same strategic vision. #Iran should not be allowed to become a nuclear power.
The recent #IAEA report and Iran’s public commitment to continue to enrich uranium require a unified international response. #Iran
Re: Free #Gaza #Flotilla, #SecClinton expressed deep regret over the loss of civilian life; U.S. supported the quick response at the #UN.

NPT Review Conference has reached consensus on strengthening the NPT and affirming that countries must meet obligations.
Following up on TRR and #Iran sanctions resolutions, Turkish FM Davuloglu will see #SecClinton in DC on Tuesday.
We used to ask other countries what to do about #Liberia. Now we ask Liberia how it can help stabilize its neighbors. Remarkable.
Liberia was once part of the problem in #Africa. Listening to President Sirleaf, #Liberia is clearly now part of the solution in Africa.
Made clear to Bill O’Reilly that we directly and forcefully discussed our human rights concerns with China. Nothing to apologize for.
Just taped the O’Reilly Factor defending our recent U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue. Tune in at 8 pm.
We are following developments in #Bangkok very closely and remain deeply concerned. A political solution is the only answer. #Thailand
We await the results of the South Korean ship investigation. North Korea should know that provocative acts have consequences.
Contrary to what #Iran says, further sanctions for Iran’s failure to abide by international obligations are both legitimate and likely.
George Mitchell opened the second round of substantive proximity talks with Palestinian officials today. Israeli leaders tomorrow.
#SecClinton talked with #EU rep Tony Blair today about how to improve investment climate for Palestinians.
It doesn’t take a reading test to recognize misguided legislation. I have read the #Arizona law. Comprehensive reform is the right answer.
We talked with the Chinese about freedom of religion. Who led the discussion? Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.
Our discussion with #China was not about the #Arizona law, but the rule of law, transparent government and an independent judiciary.
Who brought up the #Arizona law during the #humanrights dialogue with #China?... Former #SupremeCourt Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.
@SarahPalinUSA says “...We have nothing to apologize for.” Same for our discussions with #China, which highlighted freedom of expression.
@SarahPalinUSA claims we apologized to #China for the #Arizona law. We did no such thing. We showed China what open political debate means.
#Sudan says it is committed to peaceful negotiations. Words must be backed by actions. #Darfur
#Sudan must stop on-going military operations in #Darfur.
We express our deepest sympathies to victims of Afriqiyah Airways crash.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to victims' families and friends.

Pres. Karzai visited @StateDept tonight. We're building a relationship for the long-term, like we have with many countries around the world.
We have a comprehensive review of our landmine policy in progress. Hope to move closer to Ottawa Treaty compliance in the process.
The #PLO endorsement of proximity talks is an important and welcome step.
We continue to work on a sanctions resolution that will show #Iran there are consequences for non-compliance.
Iranian Foreign Minister invited United Nations Security Council to dinner, served leftovers. Unfortunately, he said nothing new. #Iran
Ahmadinejad says bin Laden is in DC. We don’t have him; what we do have is another wild Iranian accusation and no accountability. #iran
13 countries and international organizations have offered assistance with the #oilspill. We are grateful and are evaluating what we need.
We thank #Spain, #Bulgaria for each accepting 1 detainee from Guantanamo. We remain committed to closing GTMO. Today, 181 detainees remain.
Talked w/Gration in Khartoum. New govts being installed. Parties must fully implement CPA. Time is critical. We will hold them accountable.
@digiphile Been talking to @KateAtState @DanielSchaub re: Tweeting for some time. w/ @chavezcandanga entering the field, how could I resist?
At the #UN, #SecClinton pledged the U.S. will do its part to strengthen the #NPT. Didn't see anyone walk out in protest.
At #UN, rather than answer questions about his nuclear program, President Ahmadinejad tried to hide the ball. We aren't playing his game.
At #UN, President Ahmadinejad claims that #Iran accepted TRR offer. But Iran has yet to respond to #IAEA. The ball remains in Iran's court.
Hello world. Excited to be here on Twitter. Looking forward to our global conversation.
