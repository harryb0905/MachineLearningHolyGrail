A good name will shine forever.
The main thing is to be moved , to be love , to hope , to tremble , to live
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going!!!
Your actions are all you can own. Your life is YOUR story, go write it.
Be that person who can smile on a bad day!
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream!!!
It's okay to be different!!!
When you are living the best version of yourself, you inspire others to live the best versions of themselves.
Today, fill your cup of life with happiness and laughter.

We all have the same roots, and we are all branches of the same tree.
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
At the end of the game pawns and kings go back into the same box.
It's not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.
I  tell myself every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better!!
The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.
Great article on my brother from another mother. @tj_ford  http://t.co/LnkGmSPCla
Your life is your story go write it.
Making a million friends is not a miracle... The miracle is to make such a friend who can stand with you when millions are against you!!
The chief happiness for a person is to be what he or she is!!!
The purpose of life is a life of purpose.
We are all born original don't become a copy!!!
The smallest good deed is better than the grandest intention.
It's never the load that breaks you down. It's the way you carry it. Food for thought.

Culture beats strategy all day long!!!!
To know what you know and what you do not know, that is true knowledge.

RIP Anthony Mason. A Queens &amp; NYC legend. Thanks for paving the way.
When you interested in something, you do It when it's convenient. When you're committed to something, you do it all the time.
What lies behind us and what lies before us are but tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
Success does not come through grades,  degrees or distinctions. It comes through experiences that expand your belief in what is possible.
"The masses in the struggle will react in several ways. They can overcome it, challenge it, live in it, or fall victim to it."@PhilBeckner
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling,but in rising every time we fall!!

There are no classes in life for beginners: right away you are always asked to deal with what is most difficult.
A good opportunity is seldom presented, and is easily lost.
Too late!!!!!! @KDTrey5 finished him fatality!!!!
The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.!!!
It is not enough to take steps which may some day lead to a goal; each step must be itself a goal and a step likewise.
I'm glad to see my young bro @rjOKCson_15 getting a golden opportunity he is taking full advantage of it. I see you young Coffee!
There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our !
Happiness resides not in posessions and not in gold; the feeling of happiness dwells in the soul.

No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path towards our own salvation!
We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.
If u focus on success you'll have stress, but if u pursue excellence, success will be guaranteed.

“For everything you have missed, you have gained something else, and for everything you gain, you lose something else.”
People don't do things for you or against you, they do things for themselves , it's fortune, good or bad, to be in the way
Some pursue happiness others create it.!!!!
Knowing others is intelligence knowing yourself is true wisdom.Mastering others is strength mastering yourself is true power
Optimism is essential to achievement and it is also the foundation of courage and true progress.
Good friends are like stars.... You don't always see them, but you know they are always there. #truestory
💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
Dreams are like stars...you may never touch them, but if you follow them they will lead you to your destiny. #sleepwell
Happiness is not the absence of problems but the ability to deal with them.
It's better to be an optimist who is sometimes wrong than a pessimist who is always right!
