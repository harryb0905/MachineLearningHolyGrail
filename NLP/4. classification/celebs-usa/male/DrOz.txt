Take is slow at meal time: The holidays are full of tasty treats. Don‚Äôt forget about food that‚Äôs good for you ‚Äì and take it slow at parties so you don‚Äôt feel uncomfortably full. (6/6)
Take a few deep breaths: Get out all that stress with some cleansing breaths from your belly. (5/6)
Listen to music: Put on something you love, especially later in the day ‚Äì it‚Äôll drop your heart rate and change your mood. (4/6)
Do something for others: Acts of kindness will make you (and the recipient) feel good. (3/6)
Catch up on sleep: You‚Äôve likely been sacrificing sleep to prep for the holidays. Think about yourself for a little bit and get to bed earlier. (2/6)

@ACCinTouch A6: High blood pressure makes your heart work harder to get blood to all your organs. It also causes inflammation in your arteries, which makes them narrower and decreases blood flow to the heart. Shoot for a blood pressure of 120/80 or lower to reduce your risk of heart disease.
@nyphospital @ACCinTouch A5: Over time stress hormones can damage vessels, making it harder for your heart to circulate blood. Stress also triggers unhealthy behaviors like smoking. One study found people with ‚Äúpermanent stress‚Äù had a 2x higher risk of heart attack. #HealthyHeartTalk
@ACCinTouch A4: A healthy lifestyle is key! Eat nutritious foods, maintain a healthy weight, and shoot for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise (or 70 minutes of intense exercise) a week. And here‚Äôs the big one- if you smoke, it‚Äôs time to stop! #HealthyHeartTalk
@nyphospital @ACCinTouch A3: Yes. If one or both of your parents have or had heart disease, your risk is higher. But you can lower that risk by controlling other risk factors. High cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking all raise your chances of heart disease. #HealthyHeartTalk
@ACCinTouch A2: They can be- women and people with diabetes don‚Äôt always get that chest grabbing pain you see in the movies. They should look out for nausea, shortness of breath, or unusually anxiety. #HealthyHeartTalk
@nyphospital @ACCinTouch The most common signs are chest pain, which can radiate to the jaw, sweating, nausea and chest tightness or pressure. You can also have palpitations- which feel like an irregular heartbeat. #HealthyHeartTalk
