@reeb1011 @ScottAgness And even if he did do it you think he‚Äôs the first!?!
@reeb1011 @ScottAgness that has absolutely nothing 2 do w/outcome of the game. So many other aspects of the game than the ball.. #witchhunt
@ScottAgness no the home team gives the vistors the balls to choose from. The home team ALWAYS gets the ball they want. Trust me
So after they crucify Brady they mind as well go after the 30 starting point guards in the NBA.. #whocares #LeaveBradyAlone
30 different NBA arenas... I've played in all and all balls r slightly different. The PG of each team chooses the ball....
