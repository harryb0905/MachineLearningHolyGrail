@Red_Warrior5 @MattMitovich @DavidBrodyCBN Well, you don't seem to be able to grasp what's being explained.  I will now stop trying.  You are muted.
@Red_Warrior5 @MattMitovich @DavidBrodyCBN Yes, but that has nothing to do with my comment.  If someone runs in shouting "fire, fire," it is appropriate to see where and how they got that information rather than labeling them a lunatic.
@DavidBrodyCBN @McDonalds @AOC You didn't answer the question.  Are the statements AOC made based on science that is nearly uniformly accepted?  You attempted to portray them as wild statements of lunacy without noting that they are based in current scientific thinking.  That is fundamentally dishonest.
@Red_Warrior5 @MattMitovich @DavidBrodyCBN That's not the point. The correct reporting of her comments is as being in accord with scientific consensus.  If one wants to go further and question whether global warming or the roundness of the Earth is real, one can.
@seamm54 @DavidBrodyCBN I just like honesty and America.
@Red_Warrior5 @MattMitovich @DavidBrodyCBN I did.
@Red_Warrior5 @MattMitovich @DavidBrodyCBN David's evidence is things people are simply making up.
@jimmyalto @murphymike Yes, it closed.

@DavidBrodyCBN David,  You mocked AOC for her comments on eating beef and a 12-year window for saving the planet.  True or false, both those statements are based on science that is nearly uniformly accepted.  Fondly, Bill

This is CBN's @DavidBrodyCBN saying that because he's an analyst, not a correspondent, he has no journalistic responsibility to determine if the news he's "analyzing" is actually true.  A reminder:  https://t.co/RQr0zTuD4m https://t.co/ZK9XDAMysS
@DavidBrodyCBN Typo: scientists
@DavidBrodyCBN True or false, AOC's comments about eating beef and "12 years," which you mocked, are actually based on sound science accepted nearly universally by science.
Then Trump pulled his eyes to the sides and squinted, explaining the difference between Chinese and Japanese. https://t.co/Vo54jewB6W

@programmingguy @DavidBrodyCBN @FareedZakaria Beware the false equivalency trap.  While both sides err, it is deliberate on the right.  One programmer to another, it is a feature, not a bug.
@programmingguy @DavidBrodyCBN @FareedZakaria Without watching it, I will say that it doesn't compare.  When a journalist precedes remarks with "commentary," he is removing the mantle of authority and saying that he is offering his opinion.
@tousledpigtails Changed it for you.
So that’s how it works.  By using the veneer of journalism and its implied imprimatur of research, reporting and fact, partisans like @DavidBrodyCBN guide their followers away from truth.  /endthread
When presented with this, does @DavidBrodyCBN suggest he will do some reporting?  No, he responds with a childish ad hominem attack on the U.N.  He does no research about how the IPCC is regarded by the global scientific community.  He just tells us the U.N. is dumb. https://t.co/eRIAdUB7G8
The IPCC, a scientific organization recognized as impeccable, stated in its most recent report that there’s about a 12-year window to reduce greenhouse gasses or we may find ourselves at a tipping point.
Problem is, the “12 years” comment (while presented somewhat inelegantly) has its foundation in strong science as well.
When confronted with his lack of reporting on this, @DavidBrodyCBN quickly changes the subject.  He brings up AOC’s “12 years” comment — essentially saying that if the hamburger thing isn’t crazy, surely this is. https://t.co/hemcjKwFKO
In fact, switching to one plant-based meal a day for a year is the equivalent of the emissions produced in a NY-to-LA road trip.
But a minute’s research reveals that AOC’s comment about hamburgers, while flip, is based in fact.  The greenhouse gasses (the cause of climate change) produced by the way we currently raise livestock are about 10% of the total produced.
His followers assume he has done reporting and determined that there is nothing to AOC’s comments but the ravings of a lunatic.
And here is how it works.  Because he presents as a journalist, because he is a voice of authority for his followers, this characterization of AOC as a loon has rhetorical weight.
He even reminds his fellow Evangelicals about his Jewish origins in the tweet, offering a miscapitalized “Oy Gevalt.”
So here he begins.  He quotes an article from the Daily Caller (run by open White supremacist Tucker Carlson) mocking AOC’s call for us to eat fewer hamburgers to save the environment.  What a wacko, right? https://t.co/KFUzVlCL1L
This gives him authority.  It means what when he “tweets,” there is an inherent assumption that he is speaking based on facts and reporting, not just another guy spouting off.
The key thing to understand about @DavidBrodyCBN is that he presents himself as a journalist and is treated as such.  Not only does he broadcast on CBN, but he appears on programs like “Meet the Press” alongside mainstream journalists
(It is not unusual to find converts from Judaism like Brody and Jay Sekulow held in high regard among Evangelicals.  The fetishization of “good Jews” and other sorts of philosemitism by Evangelicals is worth a thread of its own.)
Journalist @DavidBrodyCBN is a pleasant fellow in his early 50s.  He grew up a non-observant Reform Jew and converted to Evangelical Christianity in his 20s.
The way they decided to do it is to portray the Democrats as being in thrall to radical elements, and they’ve found their poster girl in Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Let’s see how it works.
The right wing has an agenda currently.  They need to portray the Democratic Party as incompetent and unhinged.  This is a valid strategy when defending a president who is incompetent and unhinged — essentially, “sure my guy is off his rocker, but the other guys are worse.”
Thread:  How right-wing journalists like @DavidBrodyCBN use social media to manipulate their audience.
Why is the right wing, who spent years being pro-America and anti-Obama, confused about people who are pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu?

Here is the sad state of journalism.  @DavidBrodyCBN decries the "liberal" slant of other journalists.  Here, in a discussion of climate, he has mocked and jeered -- but he has done no reporting whatsoever.  My dad was a reporter.  He sought facts. https://t.co/a5757LSfUb
@DavidBrodyCBN @AOC Also, the name of this logical fallacy is argumentum ad hominem.  Instead of examining the evidence and calling it into question, @DavidBrodyCBN simply dismissed it with "UN, LOL."
@DavidBrodyCBN @AOC Are you trying to tell me that you do not accept the fact of anthropogenic climate change?

@DavidBrodyCBN @AOC Here's some information about where the "12 years" figure comes from.  It is derived from the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  May I suggest you spend less time apologizing for Trump and more time researching.  https://t.co/Gcsjl5DNmU
And no Republican. https://t.co/W4w02E9HZl
@DavidBrodyCBN Again, you might want to support this absurd claim with facts.
@DavidBrodyCBN @AOC She might be giving the Earth too long.  Many scientists believe that we have currently altered  the climate beyond the point of repair and have begun an irreversible slide.  May I suggest that, as a journalist, you might want to research rather than asking comedy writers.
@NoBiasIntended False.   Republicans have admitted publicly that the purpose of voter ID laws is to help them win elections.
@DavidBrodyCBN Livestock production is responsible for nearly a tenth of anthropogenic CO2 production, the primary driver of climate change. I dug these facts out in ten minutes, and I’m a comedy writer, not a journalist.
@DavidBrodyCBN So the correct response is uninformed conservative spin?  A journalist would have taken the quote from the congresswoman, investigated it and reported it with facts. Something like, “while AOC’s comment about hamburgers seems silly, it has its origins in fact.”
@DavidBrodyCBN I’m old enough to remember when journalists did research before offering quips.   For example, this paper from Stanford.   But sure, reduce the greatest threat we have ever known to a pair of “zingers.”  Edward R. Murrow would be proud.   https://t.co/JqbrBrH8r9
Climate change is an existential threat to mankind, and the way we farm beef is a well-documented contributor to that crisis--which has already risen to species extinction level.  But sure, @DavidBrodyCBN -- reduce it to a clever quip with a miscapitalized Yiddish word. https://t.co/yyGhrcrfeN

@DavidBrodyCBN About half the undocumented aliens in the United States come from non-Latino countries.  Why doesn't Trump talk about them?    Why don't we hear about undocumented Canadians or Danes?  Irish?  Why does he only talk about the southern border?
@DavidBrodyCBN That the base doesn't care about facts and enjoys Trump's appeal to racism disguised as immigration policy is as close to an absolute truth as any axiom in mathematics.
@DavidBrodyCBN Essentially, you are saying that Trump will lie to his base about the wall and it will satisfy them.  I wholeheartedly agree.
Confusing trade balances and surpluses with budget balances and surpluses is to economics as confusing liquid ounces and ounces of weight is to cooking.
@DavidBrodyCBN And it will be a lie.  On two fronts.   Trade balances, surpluses and deficits do not provide or cost funds.    The new trade deal with Mexico hasn't been ratified.
@DavidBrodyCBN No one believes Mexico was going to take out a big Hello Kitty checkbook.   "By check" means the transfer of funds from one treasury to the other.   But it doesn't matter because Mexico is not paying for the wall directly or indirectly.   Promise broken.
@DavidBrodyCBN He said, on a number of occasions – listed in the link I sent – that Mexico would literally provide funds.   He changed the story when it was clear that wasn't going to happen.   Currently, Mexico is not paying directly or indirectly.   Promise broken.
@DavidBrodyCBN https://t.co/PMoj8Wyelv

@DavidBrodyCBN There are two instances of Trump saying Mexico was gong to literally pay. One was with Wolf Blitzer. I'll find the other one (or someone else can).
@DavidBrodyCBN Trump said, on more than one occasion, that they were going to literally write a check.   To suggest that his campaign promise is coming true requires that one ignore what the promise was.

@juliekenny145 @DannaHarms @bigbangtheory @WarnerBrosEnt @missmayim @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro I'm not sure why you feel harsh language is appropriate.  We very much appreciate our fans.  The series had to come to a conclusion at some point, and this is that point.  It cannot be changed.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker You made up a number of absurd "facts" including your absolutely made-up completely false claim that undocumented immigrants can collect welfare.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker It must be exhausting just making stuff up instead of learning what's really happening.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker You're just going to keep making things up, aren't you?  Welfare is a federal program.  You need proof of citizenship (passport, etc.) to collect it.  Non-citizens are not collecting welfare anywhere in the United States.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Nowhere in this article does it suggest that non-citizens receive welfare benefits in California.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Really?  Given that welfare is a Federal program, how exactly does that work?  Give me a link to California extending welfare benefits to non-citizens.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Great.  Who works at the dairies in the northeast and mid-atlantic states?  (This information is available online.)
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Ask any economist.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker "the majority of illegals use welfare."  Non-citizens cannot collect welfare.  Your lack of familiarity with the facts about immigrants is on par with your lack of familiarity with the facts on asylum.  Brush up.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Every drop of milk in this country is handled by an undocumented immigrant.  The dairy industry has tried for years to get Americans to do this work.  None will -- even at $15/hour.  You need to do a little research on this topic.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Wouldn't you agree that it's morally wrong for you to impose laws and restrictions on people coming to American now that your family did not face?
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker In fact, our economy is desperate for immigrants.  Without an increase in the currently inflow, our economy will stall and eventually head into recession.  We need more immigrants than we are getting now.  Where are your people from?
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker From where and when did your family come to America?
Mobsters. https://t.co/qC1qvy7v6J
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Here's how I approach immigration.  My grandfather came here as a boy in the early 20th century fleeing oppression.  I ask this question when considering any immigration law:  would my grandfather have been let in?  Under the current laws, the answer is no.  And that's wrong.
@juliekenny145 @DannaHarms @bigbangtheory @WarnerBrosEnt @missmayim @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro It isn't possible.  There's no mechanism to change things at this point.  I'm sad to say that it's a "done deal."
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker You responded to me.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker When did your family come to the United States?  Or are you an American Indian?

@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker "U.S. embassies and consulates cannot process requests for this form of protection because, under U.S. law, asylum seekers can apply only if they are physically present in the United States."  https://t.co/piTFGhLWL6

The last episode of Big Bang Theory will be filmed on 4/30 and broadcast in May.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Consulates are not "American soil" for the purposes of seeking asylum.  You must physically be in the United States.  How many false statements are you going to make instead of just going and reading the law?
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker The law explicitly states that you may seek asylum regardless of your immigration status.  Go read it. It's on the federal government website.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Nope.   The law permits you to seek asylum if you are standing on American soil, regardless of how you came to be there.   Go read it.
@aaronleewaters @elisetthe @ExoThinker Seeking asylum is legal.

@mstang67 @8645AmySaysVote That's not what I asked.  I asked if you can offer an explanation other than racism for his behavior.  I didn't say you had to prove it was his rational.
@ChrisCuomo @AprilDRyan Where's the racist appeal in X-ray machines, Chris?
Hatemonger @TuckerCarlson promotes racism and white nationalism.  Regardless of whether one agrees, there is no justification for promoting him.  I condemn @RoKhanna for doing so.  This isn't how to do it, Ro. https://t.co/OMglotYWxJ
@mstang67 @8645AmySaysVote Can you offer an explanation for Trump's behavior -- only talking about brown people when he talks about illegal immigration -- that is not an appeal to racism?
@mstang67 @8645AmySaysVote Why does Trump only talk about brown people when he talks about illegal immigration?
@mstang67 @8645AmySaysVote Again, kindly direct me to comments from the president where he discussed illegal Canadians, illegal Irish or illegal anyone who isn’t brown.
@mstang67 @8645AmySaysVote If you feel that asking for an example of Trump talking about European, Canadian or Asian illegal immigrants is tantamount to calling you a racist, then you must be the most sensitive person on the planet.
@mstang67 Oh, I forgot about his lie that Middle Easterners were crossing the southern border and leaving their prayer rugs.  Remember when people figured out Trump got this and the duct-taped women from the movie “Sicario”?  https://t.co/utDR3khoUH
@mstang67 No, he only speaks about Latinos when he talks about illegal immigrants.  Why?
@mstang67 Briefings are part of the first part of the process:  identifying the problem.  Then we study the best way to spend the money.  Where is a study showing that the wall is anything but a waste of money?
@mstang67 Please direct me to statements from Trump where he has referred to non-Latinx illegal immigrants.
@mstang67 Here’s how we spend money in America:  1.  We identify a problem.  2.  We conduct research and hold hearings to determine an effective way to spend money to solve it.  Where is the research that shows a wall is necessary and effective?
@mstang67 Really?  Half the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. come from non-Latinx countries.  Please direct me to Donald Trump’s comments about illegal Canadians, English, Irish, Dutch or Asian immigrants.
@mstang67 Your metaphor simply makes no sense.  Drugs enter this country at legal ports of entry and shipped from China.  Trump is actually planning on diverting spending from enforcement in these areas to wall construction.  Just stupid.
@mstang67 I can think of no example from any politician, Republican or Democratic, of a presidential campaign making a bold, deliberate and demonstrable lie the centerpiece of its campaign.  The wall was simply an appeal to racism—and it worked.  It serves no actual purpose.
@mstang67 So when he said that Mexico was going to literally pay for the wall, it was a lie?
@mstang67 So let’s forget the claim that Democrats are opposing Trump policies because they hate him.  They are opposing his policies because they are foolish.    Trump claimed he was the “greatest negotiator.”  Why can’t the “greatest negotiator” persuade people?
@mstang67 Donald Trump publicly said — on more than one occasions — that Mexico was going to literally write a check.  There’s video of it.
@mstang67 What border professionals want is funding for the problem where the problem is.  90% of drugs cross at ports of entry.  That’s where they need funding.  Show me a single peer-reviewed study that says the wall would reduce drugs or crime.
@mstang67 Guess you missed the eight years prior.  Remember when the Republicans stated publicly that their goal wasn’t to legislate but to prevent a second Obama term?  Remember when the they were so opposed to Obama that they ignored their Constitutional duty to consider his SCOTUS nom?
@mstang67 Can you point to an example where a president used the law to make expenditures Congress refused to?  I can’t.  1.  The wall is a waste of money.  2.  The wall is a political sop to his base.  3.  Mexico will pay for the wall.
@mstang67 The emergency law is designed for emergencies, not spending policies that the president doesn’t have the leadership ability to get through Congress (great negotiator, eh?). It’s designed for earthquakes and hurricanes—immediate emergencies.
“Uh, sausage, onion, green pepper, Swiss cheese...”  “Would you like bacon as well?”  “Bacon?!  We’re in the middle of a national emergency!”  “Sorry, sir.”  “Fine, throw some bacon in there.” https://t.co/o6Sv6nwmPw
@mstang67 I guess because we rely on facts.   Border crossings down; crime down — what’s the emergency?
@HDUltralimited Seeking asylum is legal.
@graphixpro1 How is he horrible?  And how does anything justify spreading an antisemitic lie that a victim of the Nazis is a Nazi sympathizer?
Ethnic cleansing. https://t.co/3ZKloCk9KC
@graphixpro1 The antisemitic lie about Soros is antisemitic.
@graphixpro1 "His father's word"?  Where the heck did that come from?
@graphixpro1 The false accusation of Soros is designed to give a fig leaf to the conspiracy theory that wealthy Jews are engaged in nefarious activities.  It is antisemitic.
@graphixpro1 Yes.  And here is the account so that you understand what he is referring to.  If that's "helping," then JFK, Jr. "helped" put a man on the moon. https://t.co/nCuBuvvNVc
The exploitation of grieving parents to obscure facts is repugnant.
@graphixpro1 Again, the actual account: https://t.co/ap3iM8Tvc1
@graphixpro1 To help you understand what happened, here is the account from Soros's biography.  Explain to me how this is collaboration with the Nazis. https://t.co/vqZT4wIIoc
@graphixpro1 He does not admit to helping.  Listen again.  Where did you learn about the Holocaust?  I learned about it from family members who had numbers tattooed on their forearms and told first-hand stories about Auschwitz.  One is featured in this movie: https://t.co/ClbTN7qOqX
@graphixpro1 He neither helped nor sympathized.   He stated that he did not feel guilty when his guardian, at the time he was a child being hidden to save his life, inventoried property.   This is neither help nor sympathy.
@graphixpro1 The lie that he is a Nazi is designed to provide cover for an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
Well, okay then. https://t.co/Nz7esyS3KP
@graphixpro1 The lie that Soros was "a Nazi" is used to justify antisemitic attacks on him.  The notion that "wealthy Jews" are funding immigration to "replace" whites is the vile conspiracy that led to the Pittsburgh shooting.
@graphixpro1 He was a child who was hidden by his father to keep him alive.  The thing he claims to have no guilt about is watching his guardian inventory property.  You claim "he helped."  Show me where he says he helped.
@graphixpro1 Please show me where in the clip you posted he said, as you claim, that "he chose to help."
@graphixpro1 Wow, you posted that clip and you do not understand what he's saying, do you?  He was a fourteen-year-old boy whom his father had hidden with a gentile to keep him alive.  He did not participate in the action.  Wow.  Watch the clip you posted!
@graphixpro1 “At age 14 he CHOSE to help the Nazis.”  This statement is absolutely false.   Prove it.
If you didn’t need to do it, it’s not an emergency. https://t.co/lBN7nq8cYn
@graphixpro1 So you have no idea about the facts. Got it.
Trump just did a “Chinese” accent. Who else saw it?
@graphixpro1 Let’s see if you know the actual story about what happened to Soros when he was a child.   Where was he?  Why?  What was the specific and singular act he was referring to in the interview?
You know that thing high school debaters do where they try to get out as many facts as fast as they can?  Trump is doing that this morning with lies.
@graphixpro1 Are you really this ignorant of the facts?  How old was Soros during the war?
It’s 10:41 on the east coast and 7:41 in the west and the president just failed to understand that Americans, not the Chinese, pay tariffs on Chinese goods again.
@graphixpro1 It’s fun when people make antisemitic remarks to rebut antisemitism. “Nazi sympathizer.”  Amazing.

@IndieAveri If you don't believe that the well-funded Russian influence campaign has had an effect on everything from the presidential election to race relations to debates on critical issues like vaccination, you are deceiving yourself.
@IndieAveri Is your logic that because you personally blocked Russian troll accounts, their misinformation campaign didn't reach millions?  That's like when my mom used to make me put on a jacket because she was cold.

@susienewmac @ExpressScripts I'm actually a believer in generics -- when then work as effectively as the brand name.  I mean, I can't think the last time I bought brand name ibuprofen.  But when they don't work, a patient should have an automatic right to the brand.
@DarianFisher78 Oh, some of those words are in a foreign language.  Google them.
@MAFMichael Remember that time Trump gave a speech about international bankers that included phrases lifted nearly word-for-word from the famed antisemitic forgery "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"?  Good times, eh?
@davmarshall2005 Only the things my grandmother used to say.
@susienewmac @ExpressScripts Yes.  Because @ExpressScripts sucks.
@MAFMichael Actually not.  I have a friend who married a woman who converted to Judaism.  Her father is a raging antisemite.  Your daughter converting and marrying someone doesn't change who you are.
@susienewmac @ExpressScripts The difference is coverage.  You can always get the brand name if you pay the full retail price -- several hundred dollars, in this case.  You need an "override" to get them to cover it.  And their "overrides" expire after 6 months.
@sheemanio @ExpressScripts Is it not effective?
@MAFMichael Remember that time his campaign sent out an image of a Jewish star superimposed over money?  That was fun.
@MAFMichael Here's how I know you're lying.  I've never heard of a group of my people unanimously agreeing on anything.  Nice try.
I have begun the process of battling with the extremely unhelpful for-profit prescription insurance company @ExpressScripts.  I had to bring the CSR up to date.  She said, "It seems absurd that you have to go through this."  I agreed.  The thread, to catch you up: https://t.co/zrAGCgPcoz
@MAFMichael What do your Jewish friends say when you raise this?
@graphixpro1 Oh, gosh, then you'd better go read about what he actually said.  He referred to an antisemitic lie that wealthy Jews are "funding" the caravan.  They aren't.  It's part of a conspiracy theory that suggests Jews are engaged in a campaign to replace white people with immigrants.

@JeremyR86 What are the statistics?
@JeremyR86 Show me where I said that.
@JeremyR86 I made no such leap.  I merely asked you for data about how much crime and what sort of crime members of MS-13 commit.  How many mass shootings have they committed in the past few years?
@JeremyR86 Stephen Craig Paddock killed 58 completely random people in Las Vegas.  He was a postal worker.  Do we have a problem with postal workers that we should look at?

@jellazar I so appreciate your predicament. With only 8 tapings left, the situation with tickets is beyond difficult. I have asked friends and family to give up seats. There just aren't any left.
@TheRaDR A debate I've found myself in with a prominent figure in evangelical Christianity.  My thesis is that legal restrictions on abortion are the imposition of a single religious tradition on those who don't practice it.
@TheRaDR Okay, the biggest todah rabah for you!
@TheRaDR I’m hunting for two threads of yours (I think)... abortion and why there is no “judeo-christian” tradition.
@BruckerHaran I actually discussed my grandfather father with an immigration attorney friend. He said he would absolutely have been turned away under the current law.
@BruckerHaran My grandfather would not meet the current requirements. There are quotas, sponsorship requirements, etc.   He would be turned away.
On MTP, @DavidBrodyCBN once again referred to “third trimester abortion” as if women are deciding days before birth they’d just rather not have a kid.   These rare procedures are done when the child has no chance of survival or death is a certain risk.   Brody’s framing is cruel. https://t.co/n3NdlCiHea
@BruckerHaran @realDonaldTrump I say that they are not climatologists.
@BruckerHaran Again, my grandfather would be barred under the current laws.   Is that right?
@BruckerHaran @realDonaldTrump Science isn't a matter of opinion.  If you think it is, you don't know what the word "science" means.  Climate change is real, it is man-made and it is causing very dangerous weather right now.  And it will get worse.  And science doesn't care what you think.
@BruckerHaran And consider this -- my grandparents would not be allowed into the country today.  They would be turned away under the current laws.
@BruckerHaran The other thing I see is very sad -- there is such bigotry and prejudice against immigrants these days, and it echos the bigotry our parents and grandparents faced -- "no Jews allowed," "no Irish need apply," etc. Now the hate is directed against Latinos, arabs, etc.
@BruckerHaran I live among immigrants and work with them every day.  The immigrants I see and know remind me so much of my grandparents.  They truly work so hard and are part of what makes this country amazing.  If you don't think so, then you need to spend time among them.  You're missing out
@BruckerHaran In fact, most immigrants over the past hundred years have received some form of assistance.  And no one works harder than undocumented immigrants -- who are not eligible for any welfare program.
@BruckerHaran Yes, the immigrants in my grandparents' time were just like today's immigrants.  And like today's immigrants, my grandparents and others faced fierce prejudice.
@BruckerHaran Yes, my family came here legally.  There were two legal requirements at the time:  the name of someone in the United States (preferably a relative) and about $10 in your pocket.  How can I impose requirements on someone else's family beyond what mine went through?
@BruckerHaran @realDonaldTrump If you saw a hundred doctors and 97 said you had cancer and should get treatment and 3 said you had a cold and should drink orange juice, what would you do?
@BruckerHaran Great.  Would you be comfortable with the immigration regulations that were in place in 1956?  My family came to America in the early 1900s -- refugees from Latvia who were fleeing to avoid the conscription of the sons into the Russian army.
@BruckerHaran When and from where did your family come to America?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE You mean where he said girls in Moscow would do “anything” and he bragged about sneaking into women’s dressing rooms?
@AgelessJE @JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET Not if you’re the Trump Org.   https://t.co/wk6HFGOYhk
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE I have a dear friend who worked on Celebrity Apprentice. He describes Trump as crude and remarkably uneducated. He was particularly vulgar with women.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE They did not have the same opinion. That is a deliberate distortion.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE At this point, I'd be happy with a President who could read and didn't lie three times a day.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Perhaps a tad longer than Mueller?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE How long was the Watergate investigation?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE It is currently February 2019.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE At that time.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Compare the length of this investigation to Benghazi or Watergate.   And I don't believe Rosenstein said any such thing. Once again, Trump is lying.
@IncarnatedET @JasonAMasters1 @AgelessJE It wouldn't.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE I do.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE We don't actually know.  It appeared to be in violation of treaties we are signature to, and as you know treaties constitute U.S. law.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE By the way, our economy desperately needs immigrants.  The drop in immigration is expected to slow growth -- and even lead to recession.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Actually, waterboarding never made it to the Supreme Court, so we don't know if it was Constitutional.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE While I am no fan of the patriot act, according to the Supreme Court, it is not unconstitutional.  There is no evidence whatsoever that Obama "used a phony name" in the email "scandal."
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE As you may have missed, the Obama/IRS issue was investigated by the Republican Congress.  It was determined that the IRS had gone after both liberal and conservative groups (correctly, in my opinion).  There is no evidence that Obama used the intelligence apparatus to spy.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE As to the border issue, I was a fan of the immigration proposal made some years by George W. Bush.  Included a guest worker program, relief for dreamers, etc.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE What laws were violated by Bush and Obama?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Resign because he repeatedly violates the constitution, but I'm not sure what you were asking about?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE I think I only know one person who lives in a gated community.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Nope.  I can walk to the grocery store and the 7-11.  No hill.  No gate.  Great neighborhood -- amazing mix of people.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE I do now.
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE All of them.    It is an undisputed fact that the majority of aliens here "illegally" entered through legal ports of entry and overstayed their visas.  https://t.co/8umWBBNrzO
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Again, the vast majority of people who are here "illegally" came through ports of entry.  Half of them are not Latino -- Asian, Canadian, European, etc.
Hey, @united -- no one slams a door in @missmayim's face.  Or puts her in a corner. https://t.co/4Vqpt7ZpHh
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Yes.  Because that's what the government statistics say.  In a recent study, people who overstayed their visas accounted for 62 percent of the newly undocumented, while 38 percent had crossed a border illegally.
@kingofkings247 @chad_almon @realDonaldTrump Is he saying that half is more than 50%?  Amazing.
FYI, half is more than 50%.  I don't fully get the new math. https://t.co/62bdQMwN8q
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro Will God tell me that it's okay to lie?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE I think you need to check your facts.  Look up how the majority of undocumented aliens entered the country.  Hint:  legal ports of entry
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro So Christianity doesn't forbid lying?
@JasonAMasters1 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Half of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. do not come from Latin American countries.  I'm sorry that I don't know the state of paresthesia in your gonads.
@pixiegurrl @realDonaldTrump There are two incidents.  In the first, he admitted (proudly) on the Howard Stern show to spying on adult beauty contestants as they undressed.  In the second, three underage girls reported he had entered the dressing room while they were naked.
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro In what way has Trump been transformed?
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro When Clinton was president, did you preach forgiveness and urge the country not to force him out of office?
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro My opinion?  Please tell me which religion says that lying, breaking the law, committing and boasting about sexual assault, etc. are okay?  Are they okay in Christianity?  Maybe I should learn more about it.
@Jeff80592915 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE @Chinook920 No satanists in my neighborhood.  There is a lovely methodist couple next door -- did you mean them?
Dear President @realDonaldTrump,  One of the predicted effects of climate change is an increase in precipitation-bearing storms and a shift in the polar vortex, leading to colder, snowier winters.  Also, you admitted to spying on women in dressing rooms. https://t.co/wOVCA32EuX
@Jeff80592915 @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE @Chinook920 "Birtherism was racism" -- Colin Powell
@PhilipCJames Somerset County, MD.
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro And I am quite confident in stating that Trump lives by no religious principles I'm familiar with.  What religion condones lying, law-breaking, sexual assault, etc?
@Janiceplus9 @kingofkings247 Trump was misquoting a poll.
@IncarnatedET @AgelessJE @Chinook920 Trump led the birther movement, the greatest racist endeavor I can recall in my lifetime.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Ah, so even conservative sources are unacceptable.  Got it.
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro Where do you stand on Trump's constant violation of the principles of Christianity?
@AgelessJE @Chinook920 @IncarnatedET There are hundreds of links.  Here's one:  https://t.co/UNwnxA0H9V
@aaronleewaters @CassandraRules You don't have to.  Bill Prady read the actual poll and knows that's not what it says.
@chad_almon @kingofkings247 @realDonaldTrump No, only about half the undocumented immigrants are from Central and South America.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Nope. Try the one from the right-wing CATO Institute.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Great. There are a number of studies available that talk about who commits crimes.
@scott_kuecher I'd prefer to get my news from Earth.
@cruiseskater @bigbangtheory @missmayim @WarnerBrosEnt @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro Chuck has been using his vanity card for years to express political views — often much more explicitly. Why the sudden upset?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Nope. I read.
What does this mean? https://t.co/Av8ZcgOttR
@AgelessJE @Chinook920 @IncarnatedET You can start with the US government statistics.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Not true.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker I have written to him on a number of occasions. No response.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker I have no such ability.   Why do you think he never refers to the 50% of undocumented immigrants who are not Latino?
@zenziana Go read the poll.
@Chinook920 @AgelessJE @IncarnatedET Look it up.
@IncarnatedET European, Canadian, Asian and African.
@PeepsLoving @IncarnatedET @AgelessJE Understand the poll.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Tu quoque.
@IncarnatedET Why, when talking about immigrants, does Trump only talk about the 50% who are Latino?  Why doesn’t he talk about the other half?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Show me an example of Trump calling out European illegal immigrants.
@AgelessJE @IncarnatedET @realDonaldTrump It actually is.   We should prepare for only those events for which there is evidence of possibility.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker I do not believe all Trump supporters are racists and homophobes.   I do believe that the majority of racists and homophobes support Trump.   Do you see the difference?
@AgelessJE @IncarnatedET @realDonaldTrump So you’re saying I should be prepared to become a ball player?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Ask the president—he’s the one who only talks about Latinos.
@AgelessJE @IncarnatedET I know that immigrants are a net financial boon to the economy, regardless of status.
@AgelessJE @IncarnatedET @realDonaldTrump Because there is no evidence to support that.   The question was one of desire. If you asked me if I wanted to be a professional baseball player, I’d say yes.  It ain’t gonna happen.
@toddpenley How do you know “FISA will be made public.”  Who told you?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Why does he only talk about those undocumented immigrants who are Latino?
Approximately 22 Veterans a day commit suicide.   Would at least  22 of my Twitter friends please copy and tweet?   (Not RT).  💥💥💥Veterans Crisis Line                    800-273-8255
@AlexGoldman73 I'm not aware of Democrats engaged in a dishonest effort to falsely portray an ethnic or religious group as criminal and dangerous.  I reject the "both sides" argument.
@AlexGoldman73 Similar is the focus on violent crimes committed by Latino immigrants.  Every study has shown that immigrants -- regardless of status -- commit crimes at a lower rate than the native-born.  It is an effort to create the lie that immigrants as a group are violent.
@AlexGoldman73 Why does he only talk about Latinos when he talks about immigration?  Why does he only talk about the southern border when it is not the path of entry for the majority of the undocumented?
@IncarnatedET @AgelessJE 1.  42 million Latinos aren't coming.  2.  Why, when talking about immigration problems, does Trump only talk about Latinos?
@toddpenley You've done no work.  If you had, you would have links.
@AlexGoldman73 Optics?  Maybe.  Racism seems the more likely answer.
@AlexGoldman73 Bush's proposal was killed by the GOP.
@AgelessJE @IncarnatedET 42 million aren't coming here.
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Instead of basing the spending of billions of our tax dollars based on what you or I "say" might work, how about we do actual studies and have experts advise us?
@AlexGoldman73 That's true.  Every Irish bar I've ever been in has employees that are here having overstayed their visa and are being paid under the table.  Never hear Trump talking about English or Irish or Canadians or Asians here without permission.  Why?
@AlexGoldman73 Would you support the immigration proposal George W. Bush made?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov The government spends a lot of money on things I don't like as well.  I think that we can both agree that if an expenditure will have little to no effect on the problem it claims to solve, it is bad.
@AlexGoldman73 In this discussion, you have repeatedly claimed I believe things and support things that I do not.  How is that helpful?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov When we send money overseas, we do it because it is the belief of the State Department and the Pentagon we are making Americans safer.  And yes, the government has limited resources.
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Again, if you had limited resources, would you fix the section of the roof with the enormous hole where water pours in, or the tiny leak where it drips in?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Should someone like the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson -- both of whom have an outsized influence on American politics -- be prohibited from speaking or contributing money?
@AlexGoldman73 No one is arguing for that.  You might do better to examine what's really being proposed rather than the crazed versions imagined in right-wing media.
@AlexGoldman73 Untrue.  Consider the George W. Bush proposal.
@AlexGoldman73 Absolutely not.  I was a supporter of the immigration plan offered by George W. Bush.  It created a guest worker program so that industry and agriculture had access to a workforce and that workforce was protected from exploitation.
@AlexGoldman73 My question was, what harm do they cause?
@AlexGoldman73 I cannot find a single prominent individual who supports open borders.  Show me an example of someone saying they support open borders.
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Let's look at one big issue: drugs.  We know that the amount of drugs that come between legal points of entry is minuscule.  It is smuggled through legal points.  Where should we spend money to stop drugs?
@AlexGoldman73 No, but that is the reducto ad absurdum extension of what I said.  Argue against the points I actually made, rather than things you make up.
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov So some Americans are not allowed to have opinions because of how they feed their families?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Yes, we should address the problems at the border -- intelligently and based on solutions that will work.  The "wall" is a stupid idea and a waste of money.
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Who are "people who pretend to be someone else"?
@SBBJames It is racist because Trump mentioned a single race and implied they are a threat.  If that's not racism, I don't know what is.
@AlexGoldman73 Those statements aren't connected.  1.  The claim that immigrants (documented and undocumented) raise the crime rate and become an economic burden have been studied and proven false.  2.  I do not support "open borders."  Nor does anyone.
@AlexGoldman73 Don't lie about what I believe.  Neither I nor anyone I know supports "open borders."
@SBBJames Show me evidence that anyone is advocating for "open borders."
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Why?  What has changed for you in the last two years?  We have just learned that the tax cut had no benefit for the vast majority of Americans who are seeing smaller than ever refunds.  What's better for you?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov I spent the majority of my life scrambling for employment, in debt and trying to figure out how to feed myself and my family.
@AlexGoldman73 That's a tautological argument.  What harm do undocumented immigrants cause?
@SBBJames In fact, our economy desperately needs immigrants to expand.  Immigrants (both documented and undocumented) are a net economic benefit to the United States.  Why does the president only talk about Latinos?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov Your work sounds very hard.  I know that you work hard to support your family.  So do I.
@SBBJames It says nothing of the sort.  It refers to a poll asking people if they might want to live in the U.S.  What policy does it refer to?
@tawnysthoughts So what?  If I asked in a survey "Do you want to be rich?" how many would say yes?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov When I was a young writer starting out, I often worked 80 hour weeks.  I remember one terrible show where we slept at the office because there wasn't time to go home and shower.
@AlexGoldman73 If undocumented workers are so dangerous, why did the Trump organization employ them for decades and even help them get false papers?  https://t.co/7Mlw6rGcaY
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov I get up in the morning and I go to work.  What do you do?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov What walls?
@SBBJames So given that the president's tweet does not refer to any actual problem, and goes out of its way to single out one group of immigrants (Latinos), explain to me how it isn't racist.
@mtbeaches The article referred to desire.  If I polled Americans and asked "do you want to be rich?" and got a response of 100%, does that mean those people are going to be rich?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS @DHSgov We have many problems on the border.  The wall is not a solution.
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer Show me a quote from a single Democratic politician calling for "open borders."
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS No, it's like saying that there's a fire in one house, but we should send the fire department to all the houses, resulting in an inadequate force to fight the fire at the house that is burning.
@AlexGoldman73 No, Trump is demonizing a group of people by attributing false characteristics to them.  True or false:  immigrants, documented and undocumented, commit violent crimes at a rate lower than the native-born?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS Why don't we direct resources to where the problem is, rather than where the problem isn't?
@mtbeaches The article didn't say what the president said it said.  He implied that 42 million Latinos were on their way over the border.  They're not.  And why does he only talk about Latinos?
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer Logic isn't evidence.
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS Yeah, mostly from China.  Why isn't Trump talking about that?
@SBBJames The poll found that 42 million Latin Americans WANT to live in the U.S.  So what?  If I asked "Do you want to be rich?" probably everyone would say yes.  Does that mean they're going to be rich?
@ABCanada84 @GovAbbott @TxDPS How do the bulk of illegal drugs enter the U.S.?
@mtbeaches Yes, the poll asked Latin Americans if they want to live in the U.S.  It means nothing.  If I polled Americans and asked "Do you want to be rich?" I would get a lot of yesses.  Doesn't mean they're going to be rich.
On @MeetThePress this morning, once again @DavidBrodyCBN raised the issue of "third trimester abortion."  He is referring to the tragic circumstance where a child will not live or a mother is in mortal danger.  This phrase is disrespectful and repugnant.
@ABCanada84 Well, I don't have security and I'm on a diet.  I miss fancy dinners.
@ABCanada84 If you have facts you can link to that support your position, I'm glad to read them.
@tawnysthoughts @fritkis @PatBrigman Do you know the history of the slogan "America First"?
@mtbeaches He's misquoting the poll.  Go read it.
@tawnysthoughts He's misquoting the poll.  Go read it.
@Caleb_K2354 @WVBrad Nope.  I called publicly for resignations in Virginia.  Whether other people are racist has no bearing on whether the president is.  And he is.
@Caleb_K2354 @WVBrad None of those things are proof he isn't a racist.  My grandfather treated his African-American employees wonderfully and with respect.  He was also the most racist man I ever knew.
@toddpenley If I make a point and someone says that I should back it up, I provide links to sources.  If you want to debate me and make a point, you have to follow the same rules.  If you can't, goodbye.
@MelvinGillham1 "By enlarge"?  You mean "by and large."
@ABCanada84 The plural of anecdote is not data.
@toddpenley I can't find it because it's not there.  You made it up because it suits your position.  It is not real.
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer Show evidence to support your claim.
@mtbeaches Uh, no -- if the president had said 42 million people is a problem, that's not racist.  Saying 42 million Latinos is a problem is racist. Kind of the dictionary definition.
@toddpenley So you cannot provide a single link to support your position?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Members of what professions and fields of endeavor are allowed to participate in the national conversation?
@Caleb_K2354 @WVBrad Oh, gosh -- remember when he refused to rent apartments to black people when he was a landlord?  Start there.
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Actually, that's not true.  Half of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. come from non Latin countries.
@cwens70 They why does he only mention the half that come from Latin America?  Why doesn't he mention those who come from Europe, Canada and Asia?
@ABCanada84 I don't know -- do you?  I know the bulk of illegal drugs come from China through legal points of entry so -- Chinese?
@WVBrad What is your word for the hatred of Latinos?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker He has never spoken about immigrants from Europe.
@Caleb_K2354 @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer When Trump talks about immigration, why does he only talk about Latinos?  Why doesn't he ever talk about the half of immigrants who come from places like Europe and Asia?
@TrumpForBoston @ExoThinker Sure.  Just search my timeline -- I called for his resignation when the story broke.
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer Show me evidence to support your claim or admit you made it up.
@toddpenley What sort of research?  Where are the facts that you have researched?
@aaronleewaters @ExoThinker Why doesn't he talk about the half of immigrants who come from non-Latino countries?
@toddpenley Sure.  Show me evidence that Mueller is investigating Obama and Clinton and I'll publicly admit I'm wrong.  Let's see it.
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer So you can't support your claim.  Is it because you lied perhaps?  Not a single prominent Democratic politician supports open borders.
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer Not a single person you've named has advocated for "open borders."  Link to a quote from any of them doing so or go away.
@toddpenley Whoah, dude -- loosen the tin foil hat!  Mueller is looking into Obama and Clinton?  Where do you get this?  From the 17th letter of the alphabet?
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer She does not advocate for open borders.  Show me a quote from her where she does.
@NW_2006 Where can I get a good bowl of borscht in Moscow?
@CrackerALS @ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer Name one prominent Democratic politician who is advocating for open borders.
@toddpenley I know it's hard translating from Russian, but you meant "you're."
@TaraOnYourRight Russians love this sort of arguing:  https://t.co/Eqvm8UT9Oy
@WVBrad It is generally understood that prejudice against brown-skinned people is called racism.  But what would would you use for this sort of hatred?
@firefather24 Путин никогда не полюбит вас, так как ваша мать любила водителей грузовиков.
@toddpenley Путин никогда не полюбит вас, так как ваша мать любила водителей грузовиков.

This is true. https://t.co/L2DZzpDbAf
@ExoThinker @JShandsNorCal @MrJonCryer No one is advocating for open borders.
@ExoThinker How come he doesn't talk about the half of immigrants that come from other countries?
In this tweet, does the president say we need a wall to stop criminals?  Drug smugglers?  Human traffickers?  No. In this tweet he says we need a wall to stop “Latin Americans.”  Now can we stop asking he is appealing to racism? https://t.co/ZU15FfEuaL

Hey, @GovMikeHuckabee -- remember when Trump's friend Alex Jones said that Michelle Obama was really a man and had Joan Rivers killed to cover it up? https://t.co/e8I5zLkFeL
Oh, gosh -- let's everyone share with @GovMikeHuckabee some of the things said about Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, shall we? https://t.co/e8I5zLkFeL
@juliekenny145 @BrandonBippus @bigbangtheory @WarnerBrosEnt @missmayim @kunalnayyar @KevinSussman @MelissaRauch @simonhelberg @SteveMolaro Your enthusiasm is wonderful -- and even I am tempted to sign.  But the "Big Bang Theory" will be coming to an end this year.    There are nine episodes left.
So if you offered me the opportunity to dump the cruel, incompetent for-profit bureaucracy of @ExpressScripts for the government bureaucracy of Medicare, I'd jump in a minute.
While I understand that the plural of anecdote is not data, I compare my experience to that of my parents on Medicare.  They seem to just get what they need.
So here I go again.  Sometime on Monday, I have to set aside several hours to battle @ExpressScripts.  And it the war to get for-profit insurance companies to pay for medication, mine is a small, easy story.  The battle for lifesaving drugs for so many people is big and real.
Finally, @ExpressScripts said that I had approval.  Yay, battle over, eh?  Nope.  You see, the approval is temporary.  It just expired.  I know have to go through the same process -- phone calls, faxes, calls to the nice but confused lady at my doctor's office.
...to participate in human experimentation.  I asked if I could simply have -- in this one case -- the brand-name medication that I know works well.  @ExpressScripts said I'd have to go through an appeals process that required days of back and forth with them, the doctor and me.
...I take has no side effects (in me, anyway).  On a hunch, I got out my blood pressure monitor.  Sure enough, through the roof after four days on the new pill.  So I contacted @ExpressScripts who offered to switch me to another generic.  I responded that I didn't want...
For years, I received a generic version of the blood pressure pill I take.  Then the company that made that generic discontinued it.  @ExpressScripts supplied a version from a different manufacturer.  I took it.  And I felt weird -- which is odd, because the pill...
I'm a big fan of generic drugs.  They are a terrific way to reduce the cost of healthcare, and I use them.  Sometimes, though, there's something about a generic formulation that doesn't work right in some people.  Ask a pharmacist.
Under the terms of our plan, we can fill short-term prescriptions at a local pharmacy, but maintenance medications (90+ days) have to be filled by @ExpressScripts.  Like millions of people, I take medication to control hypertension.  I take it every day.
I have never failed to win the battle, but it is a battle none-the-less.  It involves phone calls, phone calls to my doctor's office, confusing, games of "telephone," faxes (yes, faxes) and time.
Like most of you, I get my health insurance at work (in my case, through my union).  My healthcare provider subcontracts prescriptions to an incompetent for-profit company called @ExpressScripts.  Every few months, I have a battle with them to get the medicine I need.
A thread about healthcare, the possibility of "Medicare for all" and the behavior of one of the most frustrating and unpleasant of for-profit healthcare providers:  @ExpressScripts...
@mobtown1234 Only a Catholic priest can administer the Last Rites of the Catholic Church.
@Neff_RxKU @ExpressScripts My for-profit insurance company forbids me from purchasing maintenance medications from local pharmacies.
Anyone who objects to Medicare for all and thinks for-profit healthcare is better should spend some time battling with @ExpressScripts for life-saving medicine.  My parents are on Medicare and never have problems.
I'm about to have to ONCE AGAIN battle @ExpressScripts to get the medicine that keeps me alive.  They cruel incompetence of this company is astonishing.
@TomWall67909168 Yeah. And even they should be able to be attended by a minister of their faith as they die, right?

@DavidBrodyCBN David, I may choose to share my family's story with you at some point. Suffice it to say, this language is cruel, vulgar, reprehensible, inaccurate, and — in the case of those of us who have survived tragedy — a thing that brings tears. Stop it.

@SoquelCreek @SenDuckworth @SecNielsen Again, the Trump administration had a policy no other president had -- the affirmative separation of parents from children in nearly every case.  It was cruel -- a crime against humanity.  You can discuss the many problems in past policy, but none were this cruel.
@SoquelCreek @SenDuckworth @SecNielsen They arrived unaccompanied, and even so, the practice was decried and an accounting has been long sought.   What the Trump administration did was infinitely worse. The children did not arrive alone—they were ripped from the arms of their parents.

@Mattwoodnyc3 @DavidBrodyCBN Hollywood allows all sorts of horrific behavior if people are making money.   Saying Trump isn’t a racist because Hollywood tolerated him is like saying Harvey Weinstein wasn’t a rapist because Hollywood tolerated him.

@Mattwoodnyc3 @DavidBrodyCBN You have the facts wrong.

@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN What's "hyperbally"?
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN If there are 100 children disobeying the teachers and you talk about all 100 -- not racist.  But if you only talk about the 40 who are Latino?  Racist.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN If Trump talked about all the undocumented immigrants and points of entry -- not racist.  Only talking about the one Latinos come through (even though it is not the major source of drugs or crime) -- racist.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Correct.  It doesn't represent the major source of drugs.  It doesn't represent the major source of violent crime (that's actually home-grown).  It doesn't even represent the major source of undocumented immigrants.  Sure it's a source for all of that -- but not the major one.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN You say that it's "the quickest way to stem the most dangerous threats," but the data shows that isn't at all true.  A response isn't a response if it contains falsehoods.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Sorry.  You offered no explanation as to why Trump focuses on a single area of entry when there is no logic to support it.  You don't get more until you make it past #1.
@ConstitutionLo1 @GOPChairwoman Yes.  You may remember him -- decorated general, Republican and former Secretary of State.  And yes, birtherism was blatant racism -- a way of "othering" the first black president.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Great.  Then you know that immigrants coming over do not raise the crime rate (yes, some commit crimes -- but so do Americans).  You also know that drugs enter the country everywhere -- over the northern border and through airports and the mail.  So why talk about the south?
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN I gave you the first example.  You could offer no explanation beyond the obvious:  racism.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Do you know how drugs enter the country?  Do you know the violent crime rate for immigrants (documented or undocumented) as compared to the native born?  Do you know how undocumented aliens enter the U.S.?  How can you have this conversation if you don't know the basics?
@CruzChix As my mixed-race friends say, you know whether you're black by whether the cabs stop for you.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN I'm sorry, you clearly do not have the factual background to continue this discussion.  When you've learned more about immigration issues we can try again.  Bye.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Sure, just as soon as you come up with an explanation as to why Trump only talks about the southern border that isn't racist.  It's not the drugs -- they come through mostly elsewhere.  It's not crime (immigrants commit violent crime at a lower rate than Americans).
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Given that the evidence actually shows that the southern border is not the major source of undocumented immigrants, drugs or crime, seems odd that he focuses on it, don't you think?
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN I have about a dozen examples.  I've given you one so far.  You don't seem to understand it.  No point in going on.
@ConstitutionLo1 @GOPChairwoman “The whole birther movement was racist."  --Colin Powell
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN I pointed out the first example.  I have many.  The first example is that when he talks about undocumented immigrants, he only talks about Latinos coming in over the southern border.  He never talks about the other undocumented immigrants.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN No, you didn't answer the question once.  The question is, why does he only talk about the undocumented immigrants who come over the southern border.  Why doesn't he talk about the other undocumented immigrants?
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN But also, my claim is that Trump is racist -- not that he became racist when he became president.  So I reject your time restriction notion.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Why, when he talks about undocumented immigrants, does he only talk about the southern border?  That's a question you can't answer (because the answer is racism).
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Sure.  To begin with, we are talking about a quality of a person.  So it is invalid to impose a time frame.  But the first thing that I offered is that when talking about undocumented immigrants, Trump never speaks about undocumented immigrants from Europe, Asia or Canada.
huh https://t.co/g96ZXnCngU
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Why are the only undocumented immigrants Trump ever discusses the ones who come across the southern border?  It is not how the majority of undocumented immigrants come to be in the United States.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN When discussing undocumented immigrants, only discuss Latinos.  No mention ever of the nearly half of undocumented immigrants from Europe, Asia and Canada.
@SwayNetwork @DavidBrodyCBN Led the racist birther movement.
@DavidBrodyCBN There are endless visuals of Trump being racist.
@DavidBrodyCBN David, he has much more than that.  To begin with, he was the public face of the greatest racist campaign in our lifetimes:  birtherism.  And then all this stuff:  https://t.co/ZyHN9yOPJv
@DavidBrodyCBN There's a difference between forgiveness and permitting someone to continue to hold office.  With Northam, conservatives are saying he should be forgiven and resign.  With Trump, conservatives are saying the should be forgiven and not resign.  See the difference?
@DavidBrodyCBN Of course.  But why the endless defense of Trump's racism (or offers of Christian forgiveness) but a completely different reaction when the racist is a Democrat?
@HrHitter33 @DavidBrodyCBN You seem to have misread who is the supporter of Trump.  I assure you, it's not me.
@DavidBrodyCBN Here's my frustration.  I have been waiting for Republicans, conservative Christians and the right-wing media to finally notice the racism rampant in out society.  They finally pay attention only when it's a Democrat, ignoring the greatest racist president in my lifetime.
@Mattwoodnyc3 @DavidBrodyCBN "When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor," Brown said. "It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back."  https://t.co/fT68qIBpoZ

@ConstitutionLo1 @GOPChairwoman Thank you for the tu quoque argument.  Is your argument that because some guy in Pennsylvania was a racist, Trump wasn't?  https://t.co/00sO5Bud7g
@ConstitutionLo1 @GOPChairwoman So you're saying he was just racist for the publicity?  https://t.co/00sO5Bud7g
@ConstitutionLo1 @GOPChairwoman Now read something that isn't right-wing propaganda.  Get back to me when you have.
@emhorst Racism is the systemic oppression of individuals due to their race.
@ConstitutionLo1 @GOPChairwoman 1.  "Birtherism" did not come from the Clinton campaign.  Go look it up.  2.  Trump actively led the movement (including television appearances, etc.)  3.  It was racist.
Adding, “by the way, we own your president.” https://t.co/AcknFwwbfN
Yep. Racist.   Now how about we talk about the guy who led the birther movement to try to delegitimize the first black president, @GOPChairwoman? https://t.co/ss3u2IOpzs
@emhorst Yes. Racism makes me sad.
@DavidBrodyCBN Nope. Two connections 1) "north" can also mean the north in the Civil War 2) the north was opposed to slavery.   No laugh.
It was then that the Governor truly looked presidential. https://t.co/3Qdbz8fnef
@DavidBrodyCBN @Jeopardy @RalphNortham Here is another Northam joke:  Northam admits he was the one wearing the Klan robes, but he insists it wasn't racist:  "I was just dressing up as Donald Trump's dad!"
@DavidBrodyCBN @Jeopardy @RalphNortham You can't.  Joke construction permits you to make one change to reality, not two.  In this case you were inventing a category and then inventing the answer.  A laugh occurs when a single connection is made.  Having to make two is what we call "too much math."
@DavidBrodyCBN @Jeopardy @RalphNortham Here's another Northam joke:  Northam seems to be contradicting himself.  One one hand, he says he's racist.  On the other, he says he's not.  Asked for comment, Trump said there are very fine Northams on both sides.
@DavidBrodyCBN @Jeopardy @RalphNortham Here's a Northam joke for you:  What's the best way for Gov. Northam to get people to ignore his racism?  Change his name to Steve King.
@DavidBrodyCBN @Jeopardy @RalphNortham This joke is incorrectly constructed.  Jeopardy has no "first and last names" category.  You are probably thinking of "Wheel of Fortune" and the category "Before and After" ("Abraham Lincoln Nebraska," "Burt Reynolds Wrap," etc.). Jokes like this require adherence to structure.
@toxicberry @TheDemocrats I can't even process what you are attempting to say.  Do you understand that only one of the two political parties is actively seeking to prevent people of color from voting and it's not the Democrats?

@Greyson2020 @AfroPuff76 Because it exists. It is bad. Avoiding that word as you suggest does not solve the problem.
@Greyson2020 @AfroPuff76 Systemic oppression based on race.
@Greyson2020 @AfroPuff76 What it is is racism.
@AvenattiJose Well, there is also the part where you publicly accused the father of two children of a crime.

@Greyson2020 @AfroPuff76 What word is correct for identifying systemic oppression based on race in your learned opinion?
@Greyson2020 @AfroPuff76 To suggest that the language that permits us to identify and hopefully address racism is itself the cause of racism is as absurd as saying the cause of murder is the existence of the word "murder."
@Greyson2020 @AfroPuff76 The people of color I know use that term consistently to describe the larger set containing African-Americans, the Latinx community, etc. I accept their guidance.

@DavidBrodyCBN Northam's behavior is inexcusable and he must resign.  But every Republican calling for his resignation and ignoring the Steve Kings their party is riddled with is a festival of hypocrisy.  https://t.co/qfINocH7gM
@AyalaCisneros1 Try reading what you're responding to next time.
@DavidBrodyCBN Oh, David.  Look at that in context.  You are better than that.
Examples of racism:  Posing in blackface/Klan hood.  Leading a campaign questioning the legitimacy of the first black president.  Suppressing the vote of POC.  Defending monuments to and displaying symbols of the Confederacy.

@alanalda https://t.co/9myVTPQuIm
@Christy_0107 @dryden2911 @pattonoswalt @realDonaldTrump The parents are responsible for fleeing danger and trying to keep their children safe. The Trump administration is responsible for taking children away from parents.

Governor Northam should absolutely resign for his racist behavior during med school.   Now let’s talk about the guy who led the racist birther movement a couple of years ago.
You led the birther movement, a vile racist campaign against the first African-American president, but sure. https://t.co/UJirCk7b95
@__CanadianBacon Question:  does sitting in a congregation mean you support everything that comes from the pulpit?  If so, I have some fun stories about Sarah Palin and her church.  I don't know about you, but I disagree with many sermons I've sat through.
In 2019 when Democrats discover a Democratic politician has a racist past, they call on him to resign.  In 2019 when Republicans discover a racist politician has a racist present, they support him.

@Ireadabooksorta Then you must have missed the last two years on Earth.
@Ireadabooksorta Then you are supporting the re-election of Donald Trump.

Got that?  No sitting on the sidelines and pouting if your candidate doesn't win the primary.  The stakes are too high.  Our country is sliding dangerously toward kleptocratic authoritarianism (if it isn't there already).  You are our only hope.
So practice this speech:  "Right now, I'm supporting X because X shares my priorities, but whoever wins the Democratic primary will be my candidate.  I will campaign for that candidate by donating, campaigning and everything else I can think of."
Support your primary candidate without knocking the others.  There are powerful forces looking to duplicate the successful strategy of 2016 which pitted Democrat against Democrat and divided the party.  Someone who is attacking, not supporting, is doing the work of trolls.
many pressing issues and the candidates will prioritize them differently.  The longer the candidate who prioritizes similarly to you stays in the race, the more those issues will be discussed.  Don't "game" -- don't try to guess "electability" or "likability."
whether vocal or tacit -- Republicans have lost the moral right to govern.  So commit to support the Democrat with your effort and money.  In the primary run-up, support the candidate who is focusing on issues that are important to you.  There are...
First, make a commitment to vote for the eventual Democratic candidate.  I'm old enough to remember when there were two legitimate major political parties in the country with competing, but valid, governing philosophies.  Sadly, with their endorsement of Trump --
There are a lot of candidates in the race for president.  Here's how to approach this.

@wasike_okile @realDonaldTrump Decisions should be based on facts, not emotional reactions or "common sense."  1.  Identify the problem 2.  Identify the root cause of the problem. 3.  Propose solutions. 4.  Scientifically study the efficacy of the solution. 5.  Proceed only if the solution will actually work.
@wasike_okile @realDonaldTrump Of course not.  That's why we have scientific studies that examine that issue.  And the conclusion of study after study is that immigrants -- regardless of status -- commit violent crime at a rate lower than the native-born.  The wall will not reduce violent crime.
@wasike_okile @realDonaldTrump Let's see your study.
@RobertD50 @renato_mariotti There is no excuse for any crime.   The false statement is that lowering the immigration rate—documented and/or undocumented—will lower the violent crime rate.   The claim that building the wall will lower the violent crime rate is an easily disproved lie.

@xlavadadier @renato_mariotti In what way are the numerous studies that establish this “unreliable”?
@RobertD50 @renato_mariotti Every group commits crimes.   They commit violent crime at a lower rate.   Reducing the number of immigrants, regardless of status, will not reduce the violent crime rate.   By your logic, the death of Heather Heyer should lead to the deportation of Trump supporters.
@xlavadadier @renato_mariotti But you do know how many people are on the Titanic. Simply measure the water line and compare it with expectations, determine the weight differential and divide by the average weight of a person.   Science gives us a clear understanding.  Immigrants do not raise violent crime.
@xlavadadier @renato_mariotti Because you know the status of those arrested for violent crime and you can count.   Study after study has shown that immigrants—documented and undocumented—commit violent crime at a lower rate than the native-born.   In fact, more undocumented people, less violent crime. https://t.co/1ZdHD8rbpV
@RobertD50 @renato_mariotti Undocumented immigrants commit violent crime at a lower rate than the native-born. The logic to this is obvious—a group who knows an encounter with police can lead to deportation is very law-abiding.   In fact, they lower the overall crime rate. https://t.co/TIy1MP80Dr

@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump Sorry. There is simply no way you are in Detroit.   I'm guessing Moldova?  There isn't a Detroiter alive who doesn't know what that meant.
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump I'm doing fine. Thanks for the concern. Think Cabrera do what we need?

@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump And you want to kick my ass because I told you about something on Fox News?
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump Oh. Then you're not actually from Detroit. There isn't a Detroiter alive who doesn't know that question.
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump Lafayette or American?
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump No. But all my family is.
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump So I tell you what Fox News reported and you call me names?  I expect better from a fellow Detroiter.   By the way, Lafayette or American?
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump Even Fox News reported that Trump changed his mind after promising.
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump In fact, he did.   Mitch McConnell would never have brought a bill to the floor of the Senate without assurances that Trump would sign it.   Trump agreed. Fox News mocked him. He went back on his agreement.
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump Not sure how that would help.  Mitch McConnell and the Republicans all voted for a measure to open the government -- a measure that Trump agreed to sign.  Then Fox News made fun of him and Trump went back on his deal.
@DeanFior70 @realDonaldTrump She did.  She passed the exact same bill that the Senate passed unanimously.
@DavidHendel @TheRaDR An account claiming to the the "Jewish Voice" would know what Jewish law states.

@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman And you believe women should be prevented by law from following the teachings of their religions.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Yes. You said that women should not be allowed to follow the teachings of their religions.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman You stated that you wanted to make it impossible for women to follow the teachings of their religions.
Yes. https://t.co/CAcvJQK5aq
@LaviniaHilltopp @FightTheCensors @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman I think he's given up.  He's realized the hypocrisy of his position -- fearful of other groups imposing their religion, but insistent upon imposing his own religion by law.
@LaviniaHilltopp @FightTheCensors @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman You might want to ask him why he wants his religion imposed by law on all women.
@pattonoswalt This is so humbling.  I thought I was the problem.  But no, it's big time famous comic @pattonoswalt.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman You actually didn't.  I've looked at all your responses and there is absolutely no answer to the question.  Can women follow the teachings of their own religions when it comes to abortion?
Thank you, @chefjoseandres for opening a Trump kitchen to feed federal employees.  Just like shelters during the depression were "Hoovervilles," kitchens to feed federal employees are #TrumpKitchens https://t.co/GtMeMM4B1j
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Do you believe women can follow the teachings of their religion when it comes to abortion, or do they have the teachings of your religion imposed on them by law?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman In conclusion, while you fear others imposing their religious beliefs by law, you want to impose your own religious beliefs by law.  I believe the word we're looking for here is "hypocrisy."
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Do you believe that women should be allowed to follow the teachings of their religion when it comes to abortion or do they have to follow your religion?
Pitchers and catchers report in 21 days!  #baseball @tigers
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman It's actually not "humanist."  You can read what the humanist movement says about abortion.  Again, do you believe women should be allowed to follow the teachings of their religion when it comes to abortion?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Do you believe that women can follow the teachings of their religion when it comes to abortion, or should they be forced to follow the teachings of yours?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman First, "prima facie" is spelled without any diacritical marks.  Second, you said that there were legal "no-go zones" enacted into law by Muslim legislators.  Where are they?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Yes.  That is the point of view of your particular Christian sect.  And I understand that you want to impose that Christian law on all people regardless of what religion they are -- sort of a Christian "sharia law," if you will.
@sareysmom Of course.  First, this was not a ruling on the merits, merely on the TRO.  The merits have yet to be tried (although this does hint where SCOTUS is on the merits).  SCOTUS can be overridden with legislation or a Constitutional amendment, depending on the nature of the ruling.
@joycemarieh66 @phillyrcvt These are not food kitchens.  They are Trump kitchens.  #TrumpKitchens
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman So you are in favor of all women being allowed to follow the teachings of their religion when it comes to abortion?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman The BBC did not document it.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman That is to say, you support the imposition of Christian religious law on all Americans regardless of what their religion teaches about abortion.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman You provided not a single fact.  Try again.
@laurenduca @AshleyEsqueda https://t.co/03yrDx6HGt

@FightTheCensors @rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman Where is there a “no-go zone”?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Where is there a “no-go zone”?
@FightTheCensors @rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman Name one example of a Sharia law enacted in Europe.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman What’s an example of a Muslim legislator in France attempting to enact Sharia law?
@FightTheCensors @rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman By providing absolutely not one fact.   Yeah. Mopped.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Your “bet”?  Based on what?  Just prejudice, I guess.
@FightTheCensors @rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman Even though dragons are enormous and breathe fire I am not afraid of them. Because they don’t exist.   Give me an example of a Muslim legislator in the United States attempting to enact Sharia law.
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman When in the history of the United States have they ever tried?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Again, there have been Muslim legislators in America for decades. When have they ever attempted to enact Sharia law?  I know when Christians have attempted to enact Christian law, but not Muslims.
@rpgajewski1 @FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman The only party that has ever attempted to write religious law into law is the Republican Party.   You are afraid of something that isn’t real?  Why?  Who made you so angry?  Why do you hurt?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman That is as pertinent to this discussion as saying that the Crusades are a cautionary tale about Christianity.   The only religious laws that have ever been attempted to be enacted as civil laws in the United States have been Christian religious laws enacted by the GOP.

@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Show me the pattern.   There are Muslim legislators all over America and they’ve been there for decades.   Show me the pattern.
@rpgajewski1 @kelchisak @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You cannot provide a single example of a Muslim legislator anywhere in the United States introducing a law enacting “Sharia.”  What has happened to you to make you so fearful?  How have you been hurt?  What has put all this hate in your heart?
@FightTheCensors @LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman Read the thread before you jump in.
@FightTheCensors Not an example of a Sharia law introduced by a Muslim legislator that was overturned by SCOTUS. If you want to jump into a thread, read it first.
#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/YiCgRlzmRy
@LaviniaHilltopp @rpgajewski1 @davidmweissman The question was, what is an example of a Sharia law introduced by Muslims that the Supreme Court ruled against?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman I paid attention.   You didn’t.   That’s why you got frustrated when you were caught lying.
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman What was the Sharia law they ruled against?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You said that SCOTUS ruled against Sharia law.   Then you said that SCOTUS never ruled against Sharia law.   Which is it?
PJ, Tobin and Squee must be so proud. https://t.co/BkcTVBU2Nu
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You never said SCOTUS handled any Sharia issue??????  Yes, you did.  You said they routinely ruled against it. https://t.co/KbO8hnzKbN
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman Give me an example of “creeping sharia law.”  Just one.   From anywhere in the U.S.
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You are misinformed.   Are you interested in learning, or are you comfortable substituting ideology for information?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman There are Muslim legislators in state governments all over America.   I can give you plenty examples of Republicans attempting to enact Christian religious law.   You cannot provide a single example of a Muslim trying to enact Muslim religious law.   Why?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You may believe it, but it never happened. Not once. Ever.   Give a single example of a “Shariah law” that SCOTUS ruled against.
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman 1.  Only citizens can receive welfare. 2.  Who supports “sanctuary cities”?  Cops. Ask one, 3.  Immigrants—documented and undocumented—are a net economic gain.  4.  Trump just exploded the national debt beyond belief.   Glad to provide details on any of these.
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman The only party that has EVER tried to enact religious law has been the Republican Party.   Name a single Muslim legislator who has EVER tried to enact religious law.
@rpgajewski1 It is not. Harris was born in California and her parents were not diplomats. She is an American citizen.   What may be confusing you is her skin color.
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You haven’t answered a single question.   What’s an example of a socialist program you oppose?  Public schools?  The interstate highway system?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman What “socialist” government programs do you oppose?  Street maintenance?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman What is their “ultimate goal”?
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman You have said that you support many socialist programs.   You have said that you oppose the imposition of religious law.   What’s an example of something they advocate for that you disagree with?
To the brave trans Americans who have put on our country’s uniform and offered to lay down their lives for my children, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.   This is a hard fight, but you’ve been in fights before.   We are on your side.
@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman “Stewardship of the wealth for the common good” is socialism.   And again, the only party who has ever proposed religious law is the Republican Party.

@rpgajewski1 @LaviniaHilltopp @davidmweissman The only candidates I’ve ever seen run on a campaign of instituting religious law have been Republicans.   As to socialism, are you saying we should abandon the military, public roads, public schools, the postal service, garbage collection, Social Security and the CDC?

@andylassner See if you can find someplace not quite so close.

@sgerard You were explaining how you could lead a racist movement like birtherism and not be a racist.

@sgerard @hollygirl2008 @DouglasMoser @JohnFugelsang If he's not racist, why did he lead the racist birther movement?
@sgerard @hollygirl2008 @DouglasMoser @JohnFugelsang Are you suggesting that it is okay for Trump to be racist because you believe others are?  Please explain how Trump could simultaneously not be racist and lead the racist birther movement.
@davidmweissman As long as you support the eventual winner, any choice you make now is good. Support the candidate who is advocating for issues important to you because the longer they stay in the race, the more we will hear about those issues. Ignore “personality.”

@sgerard @tchen002 @hollygirl2008 @JohnFugelsang Trump led the greatest racist movement of our lifetime:  birtherism.  (And no, birtherism wasn't "started by Clinton.")  He also called neo-Nazis "very fine people."
@OnlineAlison With a band led by the astonishing Jack Sheldon!
@AnorakFFM He's actually "David Dennison" on the Stormy Daniels contract.
@sgerard @AyeeYoBruce @hollygirl2008 @JohnFugelsang 1.  Race relations during the Obama administration devolved due to increased public displays of racism from bigots furious over a black president.  2.  Trump led the greatest racist movement of the last ten years:  birtherism.
The Speaker's office never received a signed acceptance from Trump.  Apparently he intends to do it right after he puts his David Dennison on that Stormy Daniels hush agreement. https://t.co/IyVvpKhYb4

@sgerard @JohnFugelsang But just to be clear, you acknowledge that the amazing change in the unemployment rate was clearly, as the chart demonstrates, the work of President Obama, right?

@sgerard @SarahKSilverman Donald Trump recently tweeted material from one of the most antisemitic websites in existence.   He used antisemitic materials found online in his campaign.   He gave a speech that revisited the vilest antisemitic stereotypes.   He called neo-Nazis “very fine people.”
@maarlotta So instead of the gospels, we should rely on what you “think” Jesus would say about the current situation?  Please show me the list of people Matthew 7:12 doesn’t apply to.
@maarlotta Where does he oppose it?  “Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me... unless they are Latinos from Central America.”?

@HarmenNix @CBP Yes, and we shouldn't make a $6 billion downpayment toward a $100 billion cost for a marketing strategy.  We should find real solutions to real problems -- and the wall isn't it.
@HarmenNix @CBP The plural of anecdote is not data.  An expenditure of this kind requires two steps:  1.  Define the problem.  2.  Determine if the proposed solution will address the problem.  I’ve already shown that — despite the president’s rhetoric — it will have no effect on drugs.
@HarmenNix @CBP What CPB actually wants is more lanes and more inspectors at legal crossings. That's how you stop the drugs, not a wall where no drugs cross.
@Kent_Stark It will not protect American citizens.
@VictorFreely @AOC @FoxNews He doesn't have two physical offices.
@Kent_Stark Regardless of the questionable conclusion of this piece, how does that justify throwing taxpayer money down a toilet by building this impossible-to-build wall?
@slim6600 @SarahKSilverman Yes, making fun of the jewelry someone wears and abject bigotry are different.
@HarmenNix @CBP That's not what that means.   Based on interdiction, we know that 90% of the illegal drugs that enter the country do so through legal checkpoints.   Drugs move in large quantities — often hidden in trucks. It's economically unfeasable to bring them across elsewhere.
Grifter-in-Chief https://t.co/CXLhGu506o
@Kent_Stark What a crazy response.   1.  No taxpayer money goes to abortion.   2.  Even if you found a government expense you disagreed with, how is that an argument for flushing money down the toilet elsewhere?  Wow.
@VictorFreely @AOC @FoxNews You accuse with no evidence to support.
Why is this hateful tweet still up? https://t.co/lX99PJ66U3
Trump says he’s concerned about drugs entering the country.   90% of illegal drugs enter the country through legal points of entry.   Building a wall directs taxpayer dollars away from where the drugs enter to where they don’t enter.   Spend our money wisely. The wall is a waste.

@EricKlemstein But the law still says they get counted.
@EricKlemstein The Supreme Court said that all persons residing in the United States are to be counted. We do not count tourists in hotels. We do count those who have made their home here regardless of status.   I'm done here.
@EricKlemstein Go read the Constitution and see.
No insulin for diabetics. Poaching in national parks.   #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Pmy5CfAkD5
@EricKlemstein The word "arms" has ambiguity (does it include a nuclear bomb?). The word "person," according to the Supreme Court, has no ambiguity.
@EricKlemstein No.   I'm saying that the Constitution explicitly doesn't care how or why the people are here when it comes to counting them.   Just like the part that says you have to be 35 to run for president or that there will be a Congress. It is a specific instruction.
@HappyCycler Yes. The 14th amendment to the Constitution.
@EricKlemstein Because the Constitution says to ignore it.   If we weren't supposed to count certain people based on status, they would be listed.
@EricKlemstein It actually doesn't work that way. The principle you are inventing does not exist.
@HappyCycler That's the census department following the 14th amendment.
@EricKlemstein In this case there is nothing to clear up. The Constitution is clear and specific. All persons.
@EricKlemstein The Constitution is clear when it refers to citizens in some places and persons in others.   As the Supreme Court has upheld, the Constitution requires the counting of all persons regardless of age, citizenship or status.

@EricKlemstein Glad to answer.  Some people might feel it's right to count undocumented aliens; some may feel it wrong.  But feelings don't matter.  The Constitution is clear.  It says that we are to count all people -- regardless of citizenship or status.  It's simply a matter of law.
@HISTORYWILLJUD1 @kathygriffin https://t.co/Eh9xjrDa04
@wynterklaus You got one!  And after that, what did Trump do?  Per Putin's request, he announced the withdrawal of troops!
@wynterklaus Weird that you can't find an example of Trump criticizing Putin.  He's criticized hundreds of people -- celebrities, politicians of both parties -- but not Putin.  I wonder why?
@wynterklaus I don't see the quote from Trump in there.  Where is it?
@wynterklaus Show me one comment from Trump that's critical of Putin and I'll consider this possibility.
@wynterklaus They did.  He's been in business with the Russians for decades.
@wynterklaus That's cool.  We'll see how it works out with President Putin.
@wynterklaus Looked like a judge enforcing the law to me.
@wynterklaus @Big_Bob_Mac Noting that the Supreme Court had clearly ruled that the executive branch had prosecutorial discretion.
@wynterklaus Here is the judge's ruling. https://t.co/HQqiH7kD6A
@wynterklaus @Big_Bob_Mac No. Just want the Constitution followed.
@wynterklaus There are several issues.  The court ruled that the process to add the question violated the law.  As to counting non-citizens, according to the constitution, they are counted.
@wynterklaus @Big_Bob_Mac You're mistaken.  You may disagree with the law and want it changed, but the census, upon which districts are based, counts all persons regardless of age, citizenship or status.
@wynterklaus What is your point?
@azusa1906 @johncardillo That's an argument to change the law.   Under the law now, everyone is counted regardless of citizenship or status.
@EricKlemstein Actually there were many non-citizens. They were called slaves.
@worldly401 I'm not a lawyer.

@desertveteran @kim Remember, in addition to ridiculous amounts of money, we will have to seize private property from hundreds upon hundreds of Americans.  Before we do any of this, maybe a study or two to see if it will do any good.  We know it will have no effect on drugs.
@desertveteran @kim Show me one study that demonstrates that the wall proposed would have a positive impact.
As a proud member of the @ADL_National, I applaud this statement from @JGreenblattADL https://t.co/cYvWCI6RJl
@Jamezz_Lee Trump has criticized hundreds of people on Twitter, including the heads of many, many countries.  Why has he never once in any forum -- speeches, online, etc. -- ever criticized Putin?
@desertveteran @kim So you have no evidence whatsoever that the wall would solve any problems, but we should make a $5.6 billion downpayment toward a $80 billion wall that will take decades to complete.  Yeah, sounds smart.
@desertveteran @kim 1.  The figures in your meme are wrong.  When you consider the complete economic impact of immigrants -- documented and undocumented -- it's a net plus to the economy.  2.  Even if we accept your meme, where's evidence a wall would help?  Science, please.
@desertveteran @kim No Democrat proposed what Trump's proposing.
@desertveteran @kim Let's see a study before we waste money.  Remember, $5.7 billion is just the first payment.  Estimates for the full "Trump wall" run between $30 and $100 billion.  In the middle ages, experts believed dogs and cats carried plague. They killed them and rats bred. Plague.
@desertveteran Glad he's getting treatment -- and from one of the greatest health systems in the world -- lower cost per capita and better outcomes than the U.S.
@desertveteran @kim Again, before we spend money, some actual studies and evidence that show it will address the issue.  Not just "educated guesses."
@desertveteran @kim No, but before we spend money, we need evidence -- just just a guess -- that the expenditure will address the problem.
@desertveteran @kim You raise the issue of rapes along the route.  Kindly cite a scientific study that shows that building a wall will reduce this.
@desertveteran @kim We have a great problem in this country with deaths by opioids.  Would you support a program to distribute spangled satin vests to Americans at a cost of $5 billion to combat opioid abuse?
@desertveteran @kim Whenever you are spending taxpayer money, you have to answer two questions.  1.  What problem are you trying to solve?  2.  Will this expenditure solve the problem.  Something that fails to meet this test violates the fiduciary duty of government to spend wisely.
It's important to understand the damage done by language like this from @DEADLINE  Reducing Trump's horrific racist language to a "zinger" creates an "all in good fun" framing (similar to reducing his talk of assault to "locker room talk).  It gives people permission to ignore it https://t.co/hn0zmFxFBD

@SilenceFranklin Obama's aides were present.
@mirloXXbob So when the IG report showed that the emails exchanged between two agents had no effect whatsoever on the investigation, you just stuck your fingers in your ears and hummed?  By the way, why is the president quoting a virulent antisemitic website on Twitter?

@mirloXXbob Yes, there's a lot of debunked nonsense you could "go on" with.  It's very interesting as long as you ignore the detailed examination of all these things -- by the Republican-controlled Congress and the IG -- that showed they were nothing.
@SilenceFranklin I'm sorry, which head of a country is President Obama talking to in this clip?
@RConrad62 A counterintelligence investigation of a sitting president would require AG approval according to Republican and Democratic former members of the Justice Dept.
@mirloXXbob Show me one piece of that evidence "we've seen."
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS QUOTING THE VIRULENTLY ANTISEMITIC WEBSITE VDARE. https://t.co/s0uUeX1wl4
@adamwl Not on a sitting president.  Former Justice Department officials from both parties agree that such an investigation would have to be approved at the AG level.
@RConrad62 You don't seem to know how the Justice Department works.  Such an investigation can only be approved at the AG level.
@SilenceFranklin Huh.  So considering the conversations between every president and every foreign leader going back to Washington, only the Trump/Putin conversations were conducted without any American aides/advisors/military personnel present and you see no problem there.  Neat.
@SilenceFranklin The only person working to destroy Trump is Trump.  Why was Trump the first president in history -- going back to Washington -- to meet with a foreign leader (Putin) without aides present?  Why did he destroy the interpreter's notes?  What is he hiding?
@SilenceFranklin Oh, you have a secret source of information.  Don't let the tin foil hat get too tight.
@guitardis @SilenceFranklin What did they find is the question.  It seems pretty clear that Trump acted in the interest of Russia.  They question is why -- manipulation, blackmail, bribery or a combination.
@SilenceFranklin Nope.  According to the timeline this investigation began during the Trump administration.
@guitardis @SilenceFranklin Given the timeline, either Sessions or if Sessions felt this fell under the terms of his recusal, Rosenstein.
@SilenceFranklin In order for the FBI to act, there would have to be clearance all the way to the Attorney General.
Everyone needs to think about this:  The FBI would not be permitted to open a counter-intelligence investigation against a sitting president unless there were overwhelming evidence.  The only question is where on the spectrum from "useful idiot" to engaged agent Trump was.
@desertveteran @kim Now eliminate from that 22% those individuals incarcerated for a crime other than immigration violations.  Immigrants -- documented and undocumented ("illegal") commit crime at a rate lower than the native-born.
@desertveteran @kim If a single horrific crime is a cause for action, why isn’t Sandy Hook a reason for increased sensible gun laws?  Why isn’t the death of Heather Heyer a justification for increased $$ to address right-wing domestic violence and terror, something the FBI says is a major threat?

@JsonSteele Of course morality can be hypothetical.  An alien race arrives on Earth and offers to give mankind the cures for all diseases in exchange for 1,000 people to return to their world as an exhibit.  This is a moral dilemma, a moral question and completely hypothetical.
@JsonSteele Nope.  Just said that I wasn't going to opine on the morality of a hypothetical.  Glad to weigh in when Mexico has sent the check -- they are sending a check, right?  I mean, the president wouldn't lie, would he?
@OnlineAlison Will try!
@OnlineAlison Why?
@missmayn Essentially, there is no money in the bank accounts of the affected agencies.  The checks would literally bounce.  And federal law prohibits moving money around from agencies that have the funds -- otherwise the executive branch could completely ignore the will of Congress.
@JsonSteele Again, let me know when the check comes in from Mexico and we'll talk.
@JsonSteele Let me know when Mexico is writing a check and we'll get into it.  After all, no point in picking out the car until we have the funds to buy it, right?

Let's all report: https://t.co/2Ei2Re9xhr
@JsonSteele Right.  They will have to fight hundreds upon hundreds of separate eminent domain lawsuits.  It will take a decade.  But again, why are we discussing this until we get the check from Mexico?

@JsonSteele But why argue?  Trump said over and over that Mexico was going to write a check to pay for the wall.  It was even on his campaign website.
@JsonSteele Show me the law that says that it goes faster in this case.
@JsonSteele Yep.  The lawsuits to resolve eminent domain issues can take years.  They built a highway where I'm from in Detroit and it took them nearly 20 years to acquire all the land.  People fought the eminent domain in court.

@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Trump has played golf during national crises where people are losing lives -- hurricanes, fires, etc.  Meanwhile, there is no evidence a wall would reduce violent crime.  There is strong evidence it cannot be built.  Democrats are right to insist we not waste taxpayer dollars.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump If we're concerned about insensitivity, we could discuss a president who currently holds the all-time record for days playing golf during national crises (leaving Reagan, Clinton and Obama in the dust).
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Nope.  I'm in favor of the immigration proposals made by Reagan and George W -- worker visas (including seasonal workers), a path to citizenship for people here for years, etc.  I am not in favor of "open borders," but I note that the U.S. had them for  most of its history.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump There is no evidence that reducing immigration reduces violent crime.  In fact, the higher percentage of undocumented immigrants in a population group, the lower the level of violent crime.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump The House passed a bill to open the government.  You want Senate Democrats back?  Tell McConnell to call the Senate back in session.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Your knowledge of eminent domain is as erroneous as your spelling of it.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Typo:  1.  Eminent domain lawsuits take about a decade to resolve.  2.  The lower crime rate of immigrants has has never been disproved.  3.  The plural of anecdote is not data.  There is no evidence that reducing immigration reduces violent crime.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump The wall cannot be built in three years.  A third of the land is held by private American citizens.  A typical eminent domaine lawsuit takes 7-10 years (they ever build a freeway in your town?).  https://t.co/JLBkjDolaJ
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump And given that there's no evidence whatsoever that the wall 1) can actually be built, 2) will have any effect on crime, you have no evidence whatsoever that sending this money will save any lives.  Remember, immigrants--regardless of status--commit violent crime at a lower rate.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Because...  1.  The wall will ultimately cost $20-30 billion, not 5.  2.  It will take decades to build.  You will have to seize thousands of miles of land from private citizens.  The court cases will take years.  3.  It is structurally impossible.  Why should they waste $$$$?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump So you're okay with Trump having lied about "Mexico paying for the wall"?  And his claim that he was the greatest dealmaker, capable of bringing together opposing sides, also false?  And there is no evidence that the cost will be "offset."
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump The evidence is that Trump changed his mind after he was mocked for being weak on Fox News.  Besides, why are we in this situation at all?  Trump promised that Mexico was going to write a check to pay for it.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Why did Trump change his mind?  What changed in America in 3 weeks?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump The reporting consistently was that Trump was willing to sign it.  Do you disagree with yourself when you say that McConnell wouldn't bring a bill to the floor that Trump wouldn't sign?  Why was Trump willing 3 weeks ago and not now?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump According to you, McConnell would not have brought a bill to the floor that Trump would not sign.  Why was he willing to sign it 3 weeks ago and not now?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump It matters because it's impossible to negotiate with someone who doesn't stick to the deals he makes.  Trump was willing to sign this bill 3 weeks ago.  What changed?
@papudagon @diffinleslie Everyone feels that our immigration system is a mess.  I favor the proposals made by Reagan and W that would have created work visas, a path to citizenship, etc.  There also should be border security.  A wall, according to experts, is a stupid waste of money.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Given McConnell's experience, I think you are absolutely correct when you say that he would not bring a bill to the floor unless he thought Trump would sign it.  So was was Trump willing to sign it 3 weeks ago, but not now.  What changed in 3 weeks?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump What circumstances changed?
@papudagon @diffinleslie The studies are per capita.  The rate per capita is lower for immigrants than the native born.  A hundred immigrants commit fewer crimes than 100 native-born Americans.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump So you're saying that McConnell was okay with the bill, but isn't anymore because of pure politics?  You're saying that he's acting based on politics rather than what's good for the American people?  That he's willing to have people lose their homes over politics?
@papudagon @diffinleslie Go read the underlying research.  In fact, there have been dozens of studies that have come to the same conclusion: immigrants, regardless of status, commit crime at a lower rate than the native-born.
@desertveteran So my source was an actual newspaper account, but yours was stuff you made up?  Actual derangement is real.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Why was McConnell okay with the exact same bill three weeks ago?
@papudagon @diffinleslie We actually do know all those things.  The rates of solved/unsolved crimes is the same regardless of who committed it.  We can therefore deduct from those arrested and convicted.  Immigrants, regardless of status, commit less violent crime.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump No, according to Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution, if there are sufficient voted, the President's signature is not required.  McConnell brought the bill up three weeks ago.  Why won't he bring the exact same bill up now?
@desertveteran Source?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump He brought up this bill three weeks ago and it passed the Senate unanimously.  Why was he willing to bring it up three weeks ago and not now?  If he brings it up now, the government opens.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Given that it passed unanimously last time, he would have the votes to override the veto.  Why won't he bring it up for a vote?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump 1.  Given that the bill passed unanimously in the Senate previously, it is likely that it would pass with a veto-proof majority -- why not vote on it and see?  2.  Why did the President agree to sign it and then change his mind?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump There is not.  But the House passed a bill with language identical to the bill the Senate passed unanimously in the last session.  If McConnell allowed it to come up for a vote, it would pass again.  Why won't he allow it to come up for a vote?
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Yes.  Trump made a deal with McConnell on a deal to keep the government open.  It passed unanimously in the Senate.  Then Fox News made fun of Trump for being "weak" and he went back on his word.
@nielsesb @sherebee The parks should be closed when there aren't rangers to protect them.
@JsonSteele Nearly half the land where the wall would be is owned by private citizens (mostly Texans).  Are you in favor of the government seizing land from private citizens?
@InfernalDante86 The #TrumpShutdown eliminated the Rangers that protect the park.
@PCNedStark @burchfieldjo @NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump What about the bill that the Senate passed unanimously -- Republicans and Democrats -- that Trump agreed to sign (and then went back on his word)?
@Kellylayne10 @galensmomma @JPohlmanWriting What “Obama shutdown”?  Exactly what happened?

@talinafaye Huh. When the government shut down, Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress.   And the president agreed to a deal to keep it open... until he was mocked on Fox News and reneged.
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Again, parents of troops aren't troops.    You don't have a single example of the left exploiting actual troops.
Is anybody there?  Does anybody care? https://t.co/zf0yeix2yk
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Apparently you don't know what the word "troops" means.  Give me an example of when the left used troops for a political purposes.  Parents of troops aren't troops any more than Miss Lillian was President of the United States.
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Give a single example of the left deploying troops in a political stunt.
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin It's not.  I made two points.  The first was that it was wrong to say that only the right was patriotic and loved the troops.  The second was that the left would never deploy troops in a political stunt, and they never has.  Only the right has.
@Jusbeinhonestma They bear some responsibility.  The president who removed the rangers that protect the park also bears significant responsibility.  The trees in Joshua Tree are historic and natural treasures.  Trump removed the guards around them.
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Only a president can deploy troops.  Are you saying that a Democratic president isn't a member of the "left"?  Or are you saying you don't understand that the president is the commander-in-chief?
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Well, it's pretty close to your response, after having been caught in an absolute falsehood, to accuse one of "splitting heirs" (whatever that means).  The point was that I don't recall a Democratic president every deploying troops for a political stunt.  Trump did.
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin "split heirs"?  Dude, you've got to get better Russian-English translation software.
@JasonAU1981 @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin The Kahns were not members of the armed services.  The soldiers who were sent for no purpose whatsoever to the southern border were.
@DeplorableCrush @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin You seem to not understand the meaning of the words "as much" and "more."
@DeplorableCrush @KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin That doesn't even make sense.
@Jusbeinhonestma If the absence of guards doesn’t result in destruction, why have them?  Why have bank guards?  The secret service.   For goodness sake, a little logic, please.
@KristySwansonXO @kathygriffin Because you subscribe to a false belief system that says patriotism, love of America and support for our troops is the property of the political right.   I would argue that the left, which would never do something like use our warriors for a political stunt, respects them more.
By the way, the wall can't even be built:  https://t.co/JLBkjDolaJ
@MattCarterMedia An explanation for how they compressed the decade it would take to rebuild the Capitol into a few months?
@papudagon Nope.  But if you are the director of a bank and eliminate the guards and your branches start getting robbed then yes, you are.
My new oath of surprise is officially:  "By Ted Cruz's beard!"
@papudagon Let's say a university has a "blue light" phone system to increase safety as you walk across the campus at night.  According to your logic, if the system is eliminated and rapes and assaults climb, the university bears no responsibility.
Studies show that undocumented immigrants commit violent crimes at a lower rate than the native-born.  If true, would a higher percentage of undocumented immigrants actually lower the overall violent crime rate?  Uh, yeah. https://t.co/mW0hqU8oVV
#Chicago! https://t.co/eFuDUI7dwf
@papudagon The plural of anecdote is not data.  Immigrants, documented and undocumented, commit violent crimes less often than the native born.  Foreign workers are in this country because business invites them here and employs them.  https://t.co/PkaMX5xmba
Prediction on the first government website hacked due to the #TrumpShutdown ? https://t.co/knZLjmwDK4
@seanmcarroll I do.
@Jusbeinhonestma 1. Trump's shutdown led to the suspension of park rangers.  There is no one guarding the parks.  2.  According to Trump, this is his shutdown.  3.  This has everything to do with politics -- Trump has shut down the government because he cannot enact his policies.

@papudagon What crimes?  Immigrants, regardless of status, commit crimes at a rate lower than the native-born population.
@papudagon How do we know this nature-hating ATV-driving fellow "hates Trump"?  Do you know about the politics of that part of the state?  And justify that Democrats "want" crimes to occur.  Bizarre.
@papudagon What actions?
@papudagon Fine. Trump isn’t responsible for the lack of rangers at the park. Or the fact that aircraft and air traffic equipment isn’t being inspected.   It’s all fine.
@Tailg8er1 @DMuninn @mhykol This is absolutely not the sequence of events.
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate @LarryPalmerIII1 @RyanHillMI @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy I'm glad you want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars based on the uninformed rantings of some random dudes in Tucson.  I, on the other hand, prefer to have my tax dollars spent based on actual facts.
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate @LarryPalmerIII1 @RyanHillMI @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy Ah, so instead of scientific study and fact, we're supposed to base domestic policy on some random "people in Tucson"?  Your facts are completely wrong.  My source is some people in Van Nuys.
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate @LarryPalmerIII1 @RyanHillMI @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy Where are you getting your "facts"?
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate @LarryPalmerIII1 @RyanHillMI @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy Drugs do not cross between points of entry -- it isn't economically feasible.  In order to make drug smuggling viable, you have to move drugs in quantity.  Crossing between points of entry with a big truck makes you a sitting duck.  A wall will have no effect on drugs.
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate @LarryPalmerIII1 @RyanHillMI @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy The conclusions you are drawn would be reasonable, except that they aren't in anyway based on fact.  Here, for example, is why a border wall would not stop drugs at all:  https://t.co/npcMJVZtvX
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate @LarryPalmerIII1 @RyanHillMI @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy Well, you've brought completely bogus data, so that's something.
@HelenSpade4 @ChrisTake1 @williamlegate @WritingDevil @RyanHillMI @FightIdiocracy Where on earth are you getting these numbers?
@LarryPalmerIII1 @williamlegate @RyanHillMI @HelenSpade4 @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy So the first thing you claimed was a law turned out not to be.  Where in our law does it say we can refuse an asylum request if they passed up asylum in another country?  Not in any law I've read.
@HelenSpade4 @ChrisTake1 @williamlegate @WritingDevil @RyanHillMI @FightIdiocracy Where did you get THAT number from?
@HelenSpade4 @ChrisTake1 @williamlegate @WritingDevil @RyanHillMI @FightIdiocracy Oh, your source is a crazy right-wing website called "borderfacts."  Here is a debunking of that crazy site.  Yes, there was a 90% drop -- EVERYWHERE!  https://t.co/Tkp2FaKBpi
@HelenSpade4 @ChrisTake1 @williamlegate @WritingDevil @RyanHillMI @FightIdiocracy Really?  Show us.
@LarryPalmerIII1 @williamlegate @RyanHillMI @HelenSpade4 @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy Fine. What law says you  must accept asylum in the first country you come to?
@LarryPalmerIII1 @williamlegate @RyanHillMI @HelenSpade4 @WritingDevil @FightIdiocracy No law states that.
@LarryPalmerIII1 That is entirely false.   Immigrants — regardless of status — commit violent crime at a lower rate than the native-born.
@HelenSpade4 @ChrisTake1 @williamlegate @WritingDevil @RyanHillMI @FightIdiocracy Given that it will a) have no effect on the opioid crisis, b) ultimately waste about $21B, c) require the government to seize land from countless Americans, d) devastate wildlife and e) accomplish nothing, it is the textbook definition of "asking too much."
@polymorphic09 If you believe that banks with guards are robbed at the same rate as hypothetical banks without guards, you're crazy.
#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/mbxNEHbzS8
@polymorphic09 Yes, he did.  If you remove the guards, you bear responsibility if the bank is robbed.

Flying today?  FAA safety inspectors are not on the job.  #TrumpShutdown
@DarthMouw It is correct to blame him for making the country less safe.
@DarthMouw And enjoy lunch today.   Thanks to the president’s temper tantrum, your food isn’t being inspected for safety.
@DarthMouw More than one person can be responsible.   To say that the president does not bear responsibility defies logic.
@DarthMouw The president agreed not to shut the government down.   Then Fox News made fun of him.   So he changed his mind.
@DarthMouw I blame the side that agreed to keep the government open, then changed his mind after he was made fun of on Fox News.
@DarthMouw So protection is needed.  If a college campus had a “blue light” system of phones to increase safety at night and they remove the phones, do they bear any responsibility if rapes and assaults increase?
@DarthMouw You didn’t.
The fundamental argument Trump made for his election was his ability as a “dealmaker.”  He addressed the frustration with government by asserting that he was unique in his ability to bring people together through negotiation.   “It’s what I do,” he said.
@DarthMouw Do you believe the president should have Secret Service protection?
@kglarson @Q86Dee Trump agreed to keep the government open   Then Fox News made fun of him.   When you have lunch today think about this:  your food is no longer being inspected.   Bon appetit.
@DarthMouw Then you agree we should end Secret Service protection for the president, right?  It costs us millions.

@kglarson @Q86Dee Actually not.   Trump agreed to a deal to keep the government open, then went back on it after Fox News made fun of him.   And yes, he is responsible for those things associated with the shutdown—our food not being inspected, for example.
#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/lepMFVZZM4
@DarthMouw If Congress voted to strip the president of Secret Service protection and he was subsequently assassinated, would Congress bear any responsibility?
@DarthMouw Why do we have bank guards?  TSA agents?  Secret Service?  If it’s the criminals’ fault, why have these people?
@DarthMouw Why do we have police then?
You actually said on multiple occasions that Mexico would “write a check.”  Also, this isn’t how math works. It’s like seeing a $10 off on Gap jeans sale and thinking if you bought 6,000 pairs, the Gap paid for your Mercedes. https://t.co/fdqSRluwMu
@DarthMouw Because there were no rangers in the park.   Because the rangers are furloughed.   Because Trump.

@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate Three weeks ago, Trump agreed to sign a bill to keep the government open.   Then Fox News made fun of him.   So he changed his mind.   Trump agreed to two different deals that would have kept the government open and then went back on his word.   But it’s the Democrats’ fault?
@HelenSpade4 @williamlegate The $25 billion for border security was offered by the Democrats.   Trump turned it down.   Trump scrapped that deal.

@DanielaAM22 Where is "wall" in that?  Obama was an advocate of a comprehensive immigration plan that included enforcement, asylum, DACA, work permits for seasonal workers, path to citizenship, etc.  Quote his whole plan, not just the part you like.
Remember that time Obama said that Mexico was going to pay for healthcare and then he shut down the government to make Americans pay for it and then he declared an emergency and siphoned the money away from disaster relief?
Racism and politics drive policy...  and cause us to ignore real threats. https://t.co/7Zmnwnsfvn
@DMuninn @1confucious @mhykol I remember. Obama said that Mexico was going to pay for healthcare, and when that was exposed as a blatant lie, he shut down the government to get his way.

@Piscesboy69 The responsible thing to do — rather than the high-wire act of real-time fact checking—would be to air the speech after the claims made had been thoroughly vetted so that it could be presented in context.   A live broadcast is a powerful tool this president has no right to.

@Piscesboy69 There is no legal obligation whatsoever to carry an address by the president. It is a request that may be granted.   I would also argue that the legal obligation that does exist—acting in the public interest—is ill-served by offering time to a politician who clearly means to lie.
@Piscesboy69 What sort of obligation?  Not a legal one, of course -- are you suggesting they have a moral or ethical one?

@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein It's not me.  The usage means "connected to the global Jewish conspiracy" regardless of whether the individual being referred to is Jewish.  Again, ask your Jewish friends.
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Actually, I think it's offensive to refer to people as "crackers."  I don't.  And I know that "oriental" describes a rug, not a person.  And I know that "globalist" is a word Jews find offensive.  It's not hard to learn.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Yes, and we can see by your use of "retardo" that you don't mind using words that offend the disabled.  Consistent with your insistence on using words other people find offensive.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein In any event, you are using a term Jewish people find offensive.  If that doesn't bother you, keep using it.  Gey gezunterheyt.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein "udder"?
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein I don't.  I use the term "Neo-Nazi."
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Nope.  Some words, with benign definitions, cannot be used.  We used to call people from Asia "orientals."  Do you still?
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein It's simple.  We used to call people "oriental" and they told us that it was offensive.  So we stopped--even though it has a very benign dictionary definition.  Jews find the word "globalist" offensive.  If you're not sure, ask your Jewish friends.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Yes, you do know.  You are deliberately using a word you now know has antisemitic overtones.  https://t.co/qV3GQH0wAS
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Right, see it's a word we don't use anymore, because it implies a connection to a global Jewish conspiracy (even by gentiles).  Read the article, dude.  https://t.co/qV3GQH0wAS
Can someone walk me through that ruling in the Eagles Bears game?
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein No, I'm saying that you don't understand that the word you're using is an antisemitic slur.  https://t.co/qV3GQH0wAS
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Listen, you can use any word you want without fully understanding it.  Many people do.  Why don't you ask your Jewish friends if they are comfortable with the word?  https://t.co/qV3GQH0wAS
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein And no one is "suppress[ing] your free speech."  Use all the ethnic slurs you want.
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Go ask your Jewish friends if they agree with you.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Not really.  Anyone with a good understanding of history understands how that word came to be an antisemitic slur.  But again, go ahead -- use any ethnic slur you'd like.  It's helpful.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein You don't seem to know what the first amendment is, but ok.  Again, I fully support your right to consider using an antisemitic slur.  It is helpful to those reading your comments.
@WilliPete @595sparky @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Again, if you want to use words that are antisemitic slurs, that's your right.  And it is helpful to people engaging with you -- they immediately know you're either an antisemite or ignorant of history.
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Yep.  We lose words sometimes.  It happens.  It's why "don we now our gay apparel" gets a snicker.
@DerBasterd But it increases daily.
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Correct.  Sometimes ordinary words gain connotations.  The word "globalist" gained an antisemitic connotation decades ago.
@WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Ask your Jewish friends if they agree.
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Ask your Jewish friends if they agree.
@595sparky @WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein https://t.co/qV3GQH0wAS
@WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Great.  May I suggest you look into other ethnic slurs as well.  You seem like the sort of fellow who might enjoy the N-word -- or do you just insult Jews?
@WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Oh, and I didn't link to the ADL -- why bring them up?
@WilliPete @kimmeruwp @kenklippenstein Fine.  Keep using antisemitic slurs.  It will help people understand who you are.

@DerBasterd Yes, but accidents related to problems in air traffic control equipment are directly related to frequency of inspection.  The longer the gap between inspections, the greater the likelihood of failure and accidents.  That's math, my friend.

@DerBasterd They have been drastically reduced. That means a longer interval between inspections, so much equipment is not being inspected in a timely manner.   Again, the only way we will know the effect of this is when an accident occurs.
@DerBasterd Inspections of air traffic control equipment have been radically reduced.   Without inspections, the only way we will know if there’s a problem is when an accident occurs.
@DerBasterd Inspections of equipment have been reduced.

@AmericanMinear He hasn’t written his report yet.   But a federal judge just extended the grand jury another six months—something that can only be done if there’s very strong evidence of wrongdoing.
@AmericanMinear You read the report?
@AmericanMinear I do.   There have been a number of actions taken by the Trump administration out in the open that appear illegal.
@AmericanMinear Right   An independent part of the federal government is ineligible to fund a NPS site according to the regulations you posted.
@AmericanMinear Nope. It is.   It’s also part of the federal government   The two things have nothing to do with each other.
@AmericanMinear I guess you couldn't understand the question.  Try reading it again.  I believe in you.  Here's a hint:  "The same place every part of our government does, the taxes they collect from the citizens."
@AmericanMinear So the GSA is part of the government?
@AmericanMinear Where does the GSA get money to operate?
@AmericanMinear So you can't answer a true/false question?  Must have made school tough.
@AmericanMinear I'll give you one more shot:  The GSA is a governmental agency -- true or false?
Wait, don't they usually buy soybeans and chickens from American farmers?  Gosh, what ever could have happened? https://t.co/nIjQchh9XP
@AmericanMinear Because you argue by lying, you will always win.
@AmericanMinear So we see that the GSA is a government agency that has an operating method separate and apart from the Executive branch.  But it is a government agency.  Thus endeth the lesson.
@AmericanMinear "Independent Government Agency"  Yep, "Independent" is an "opinion" adjective which correctly proceeds "Government," an "origin" adjective.
@AmericanMinear The key is that all of the adjectives are true and correct.  Out of order they are grammatically uncomfortable.  Let's see if our example works, shall we?
@AmericanMinear In English, adjectives follow a set order:  Number (five, several) Opinion (lovely, useless) Size (big, tiny) Age (young, old) Shape (square, oval) Color (red, blue) Origin (American, French) Material (wooden, cotton) Purpose (sun, sanding).
@AmericanMinear Look, you're obviously a troll, but here's a lesson in adjective order in English.
@AmericanMinear According to the rules of English, any number of adjectives can modify a noun (the big, red, angry, rabid dog) and all are equally true.  You listed the three types of entities that are legally allowed to fund a NPS site, and the GSA isn't the first, second or third.  You lied.
@will4911 When did you do the autopsy?  Are you the coroner?
@AmericanMinear The second adjective is secondary in importance?  Seriously?  The smiling homicidal man approached.  According to you, smiling is more important than homicidal.  In fact both are true.  The GSA is 1) independent and 2) governmental.  Therefore it doesn't fall into your 3 options.
@will4911 1.  Examine the cause of death.  2.  Determine if the death would have been prevented if the park were staffed.
@will4911 Nope.  I said that Trump was responsible for the deaths of people only in those cases where it could be shown that they would not have died had rangers been there.
@AmericanMinear According to you, if there are two adjectives, only the first applies.  Therefore, according to you, a tall Italian man isn't Italian, a fast blue car isn't blue and a happy little ant isn't little.  What an odd person you are.  What actually happened was that you were wrong.
@will4911 That's not how math works.   That's like saying that 50% of the population is female, therefore half of the Backstreet Boys are women.
@AmericanMinear Yes. Because I know the difference between a primary and secondary adjective.
@AmericanMinear Yes. I can read the word "government" which means it doesn't fit into any of the three categories you cited.
@AmericanMinear Well, I can read... a skill you repeatedly demonstrated challenges you.   It's why you kept posting an image of a regulation that disproved your point. Over and over.   It was amazing.
@will4911 Given that that is not in any way what I said, sure.
@AmericanMinear I see you've given up quoting things that disprove your points.
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul According to the FBI, the greatest threat for domestic violence comes from Americans with right-wing ideology. We've seen that borne out all over the country.   The Trump administration has cut funds to combat right-wing violence.   Do you care about those victims?
@Vigilanthony73 Got you the job, man.
Experienced people leaving... https://t.co/qydypJkof8
@doug_laydon They commit violent crime at a lower rate than the general population.   Don't you think we should focus on groups with crime rates higher than the general population?  Doesn't it make sense to start with the houses on fire?
@will4911 Nope. Trump is responsible only for those people who would not have died had there been a Park Service ranger.   BTW, why has the NPS site in the Trump Hotel stayed open when all the other NPS sites are closing?
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul The statistics refer to all immigrants — documented and undocumented — they do not raise the violent crime rate.
@AmericanMinear You keeping quoting the same policy that disproves your point. Why?  Did you not read it?
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul Triage.   While all murder and violent crime is horrific, immigrants do not raise the crime rate.   We should focus our money and resources on things that do raise the violent crime rate.
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul https://t.co/poLmyze9WO
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul Which border?
@AmericanMinear You have offered no explanation, but you do keep repeating nonsense. The policy you cite lists three categories legally permitted to fund a NPS site.  But sure, keep repeating yourself.
I caught that. Hysterical. It's the kind of inconsistency you get when children lie. https://t.co/WhAxNPt20U

@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul I don't have the strength to try to clear the propaganda out of your head.   According to CBP, how do the majority of illegal drugs enter the country?

@AmericanMinear In any event, there is no legal way—according to the policy you quoted — for the NPS site in the Trump Hotel to be open.
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul No, I'm saying that if you look at statistics, immigrants — documented and undocumented — commit violent crime at a rate less than the general population, but the majority of domestic terror attacks and mass shootings in the last decade are from right-wing Americans.
@AmericanMinear And a tall man isn't a man because "tall," right?
Hey, just the president of the United States promoting a book from a guy who said Jews are going to Hell. https://t.co/jFmkJzr8Rt
@TrendyWendy72 @CoachTonyPaul Not to mention that the shutdown has stopped deportations of actual bad people.
@AmericanMinear Are you saying an independent government agency isn't a government agency?  So a well-done burger isn't a burger?  Got it.
@CoachTonyPaul Actually not. Hourly workers got no tax cut from Trump (or so little as to amount to pennies).
@AmericanMinear So they are a governmental agency and therefore don’t fit into one of the three categories legally allowed to fund a NPS site.   Thank you. You finally got it!
@CoachTonyPaul I love that posting video of Trump speaking is evidence of having a “hate Trump mindset”!  Delicious.
@CoachTonyPaul Given that immigrants, documented and undocumented, commit violent crimes at a lower rate than the native-born, I know that the “crime” argument is spurious.   You support Trump. The man who killed Heather Heyer supported Trump. Does that make you a killer?  Of course not.
@CoachTonyPaul Mexico’s paying for it. Remember?  https://t.co/62dKHgOG9u
@CoachTonyPaul And yet you express no sympathy for them.
@CoachTonyPaul And again, you believe the 800,000 men and women not being paid right now are in that position because it’s their fault.   Got it.
@CoachTonyPaul So your comment that government workers knew they could be denied pay and they knew what they were getting into wasn’t sanguinity?  Huh.
@doug_laydon @CoachTonyPaul Heather Heyer
@doug_laydon @burkhartlaw97 @hopedellon @SpeakerPelosi What group is responsible for the greatest number of domestic terror attacks and mass shootings in the last decade?  What are we doing about it?

@AmericanMinear Is the GSA a governmental agency?
@AmericanMinear Are you unable to read the word "government" in the phrase "independent government agency"?  Under the law, "third party" means "non-governmental."  Which of the three types of entities referred to in the law you cited is the GSA?  It's not "third party."
@CoachTonyPaul It's good you're upfront with your comfort that the people guiding planes safely through our airspace are frightened they can't pay their mortgages or feed their family.  This will give your friends and family a chance to confront you about your cruelty.
Flying soon?  The TSA agents screening passengers and the air traffic controller guiding your plane aren't getting their paychecks.  They're worried about feeding their families, paying their mortgage, etc.   You okay with that?  #TrumpShutown
@AmericanMinear Under the law, "third party" means "non-governmental."  The GSA is governmental.
@AmericanMinear Ever figure out which of the three entities legally allowed to fund a park service site in the law you cited (“local government, cooperating association and third party”) the GSA is?  (Hint: none of them.)
@LauraD972342 It was not something I’d heard about, and it was brought up in a confusing way in a discussion about how people who opposed the right to abortion were intolerant to certain religions.

@AmericanMinear If you don’t know the answer to the first question, that’s okay. It’s a tough one—it would involve a little research.   Why don’t you try the second question—you know, about the law you cited?
@AmericanMinear 1.  To whom does the head of the GSA report (who appoints her)?  2.  You cited the law listing the three sources the PS is legally allowed to receive money from during a shutdown (“local government, cooperating association or third party”). Which of those three things is the GSA?
@AmericanMinear You really don’t understand how the government works, do you?  To whom does the GSA report?
@AmericanMinear There is no “local government, cooperating association or third party” mentioned in the article. Only agencies of the federal government.
@AmericanMinear Which “local government, cooperating association or third party” is paying?
@AmericanMinear That’s not what the article you posted said.
@AmericanMinear Yes. According to the article you posted, Trump isn’t paying.   He has ordered the government to keep open a single National Park site (in his hotel) as others close.   Did you even read what you posted?
@TexasAmerica @E29tGlenn @BuzzFeedNews According to the CBP, how do the majority of drugs enter this country?

@AmericanMinear So one of the things you’re supposed to do in business is comment about things you don’t understand and then defend yourself by saying you don’t understand things?  And you still haven’t proved your ridiculous claim about the Trump Hotel.
@AmericanMinear I make sure I understand what’s being discussed before I comment.   I also back up my claims with evidence.   I guess that just makes us different, eh?
@AmericanMinear Yes, I understand that you commented without any understanding of what you were commenting about.   It goes hand in hand with you making outrageous claims without evidence.   No wonder you’re fond of this president.

@TexasAmerica @BuzzFeedNews According to the CBP, how do the majority of drugs enter this country?
@AmericanMinear Trump is not paying.
@TexasAmerica @BuzzFeedNews According to the CBP, how do the majority of drugs enter this country?
@TexasAmerica @BuzzFeedNews So you’re saying we should waste money?
@AmericanMinear How did the Park Service post in the Trump Hotel stay open?
@TexasAmerica @BuzzFeedNews The Democratic Party is opposed to waisting taxpayers’ money.

@ronholliday @JonesLeica That should have gone pretty quickly.  Especially if you define lie as a deliberate misstatement, rather than a policy someone wasn't able to enact.

@TheRecklessHedo Third party candidates cannot win, and the GOP has lost the moral right to lead.   Who exactly would one support?
@Jdcs1223 @Emmy4Mayim Fans need to understand that directing their frustration toward our family is both ineffective and hurtful.
@beeg487 In their support of Trump, the GOP has lost the moral right to govern.   If the Republican Party as an institution repudiated him, my opinion would change.
Conservatives who support Donald Trump are offended by a freshman representative using a vulgarity.   The entire GOP is Captain Renault—shocked, shocked to find gambling here.
@emrazz @JeriLRyan College
As Democratic primary season begins, I will come to favor a candidate I feel can best lead. I will campaign for him or her.   But in the end, I will support whoever is nominated—fully, enthusiastically, financially and without reservation.   Do the same.
@Jdcs1223 @Emmy4Mayim I think people need to realize that propagating untruths like this is genuinely hurtful. It harms relationships and frustrates people trying to do hard work.
@Jdcs1223 @Emmy4Mayim The belief that the people involved in this project are playing favorites in some way is hurtful. If fans want to have an effect, direct efforts at media outlets who have control over this.
@Jdcs1223 @Emmy4Mayim When a magazine makes a request, it controls the request. It cannot be modified, only declined. Everyone involved in this project, from cast to crew, is available to any media outlet who makes a request. This shifting of blame to the show is unfair.
@Emmy4Mayim @juliekenny145 Who do you believe these “PTB” to be?  A magazine is the sole arbiter of its content.

@dre242dre @johncardillo @hnbrown4885 @quinncy You are pointing out, correctly, that undocumented immigrants are *victims* of crime more than other groups.
@johncardillo @dre242dre @hnbrown4885 @quinncy And the research that supports your assertion is found where?
@dre242dre @johncardillo @hnbrown4885 @quinncy In fact, the greater the percentage of immigrants in a community — documented or undocumented — the lower the crime rate.
@johncardillo @someideasnstuff @hnbrown4885 @quinncy @dre242dre Read the article.
@johncardillo @dre242dre @hnbrown4885 @quinncy The point is that highlighting violent crimes committed by a group that actually commits violent crime at a rate lower than the general population for the purpose of vilifying that group is disingenuous at best and vile at worst.
@someideasnstuff @hnbrown4885 @quinncy @dre242dre @johncardillo Well, you clearly didn't read the article before you commented.
@DonaldF34205943 @hnbrown4885 @quinncy @dre242dre @johncardillo The person who killed Heather Heyer had right-wing politics. I assume that means people with right-wing politics are dangerous and violent.
@dre242dre @hnbrown4885 @quinncy @johncardillo The person who killed Heather Heyer had right-wing politics. I assume that means people with right-wing politics are dangerous and violent.
@RealMrStaPuft The person who killed Heather Heyer had right-wing politics. I assume that means people with right-wing politics are dangerous and violent.
@johncardillo The person who killed Heather Heyer had right-wing politics. I assume that means people with right-wing politics are dangerous and violent.
@johncardillo Nope. But using a single horrific crime to condemn an entire class of people, despite the facts showing they commit fewer crimes than the general population, does make you dishonest.

@AmericanMinear What arrangement has been made?  Are you claiming Trump is ponying up the money to keep it open?
@AmericanMinear You are wrong.   Within the hotel is a National Park site manned by park rangers separate from the hotel.   While all other National Park sites around the county are closing, this one isn't. Why?  https://t.co/SmqYuSzEkz
@AmericanMinear Nope. Try again.
@AmericanMinear Correct.  They are closing down one by one -- except the one in the Trump hotel.  Why?
@AmericanMinear It's not a website. Read.
@AmericanMinear Why does that national park site stay open when the others are closing?

Trump endorsed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Combatting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was a major foreign policy objective of the United States for years.  If he's never read a book, did he even see "Charlie Wilson's War"?  It starred Tom Hanks and he's pretty good.

@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor The fact that you would believe this is, frankly, repugnant.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor You are suggesting that the parents of a dying child acted "weirdly," participating in a scheme to exploit their child.  That position is morally bankrupt.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor You have stated that the parents behaved "weirdly," suggesting that this was part of some plan to exploit their child.  This position is morally bankrupt.  I certainly hope you are never accused of such a thing.
@Woodcat0214 @RPMcMurhpy @AriFleischer @kathygriffin Yeah, no.  The dairy industry tried for years to pay Americans.  No one would take the work -- even at good pay.

@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor "Weird" implies suspicion.  The reason they waited so long is that they hoped the visa was approved so they wouldn't have to leave the boy's mother behind.  Again, you have failed to answer the question as to why it was reasonable to deny the boy his mother as he lay dying.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor No, you accused the parents of participating in a "weird" scheme: https://t.co/b3vJ4LjIIN
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor Again, you have accused the parents of a dying child of "using" him for propaganda purposes.  Are you religious?  Perhaps there is a priest or minister you could talk to about your belief system.  In the meantime, I hope no one ever accuses you of such a thing.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor You have suggested that the parents of a dying child "used" the child for some sort of propaganda purpose.  I can't imagine a more vile belief.  May you and your family never be accused of such a thing.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor "Basically hopelessly ill kid shipped to US to use for propaganda."  Repugnant.  The suggestion that a dying child was "used."  May you never know such pain.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor You have the facts wrong.  But I appreciate your flailing around after your initial comments based on your lack of information.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor See, here's what happened.  You jumped in without facts.  You had no idea the child and his father were Americans.  You ranted about failed states and open borders.  But then you learned they were American and you tried everything you could to shift the blame.  You failed.
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor Complete this sentence:  "It was reasonable to allow this child, an American citizen, to lay on his deathbed without his mother because ____________."
@AmyAldridge10 Pretty good.
@WallyStummy @NellSco @KurtSchlichter @jack They had a lawyer.  They sought emergency relief in a timely fashion.  The visa was being processed, but the processed was halted when Trump imposed a ban on travel from Yemen.  Why did this boy lay dying without his mother?
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor She had a lawyer.  She began the visa process in 2016.  Why should her son, an American citizen, have been denied her comfort at her deathbed?  Do you have children?  If they lay dying, what would be a reason to keep you away?  What law did they break?
@WallyStummy @NellSco @KurtSchlichter @jack Again, why exactly should this child, an American citizen, have been denied the comfort of his mother as he lay on his deathbed?  You still haven't answered.  Fill in the blank:  "This child should have been denied his mother because _____"
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor Are you suggesting this woman wasn't following the law?  Is that why you feel it was justified for this American boy to lay dying without his mother?
@WallyStummy @NellSco @KurtSchlichter @jack What law is being "nullified"?  Is it illegal for individuals with American citizenship to be in America?  Is it illegal for the wife of an American citizen to apply for a visa?  Exactly what law is being nullified?
@WallyStummy @NellSco @KurtSchlichter @jack Again, why shouldn't this woman have been able to be at the deathbed of her dying American son?
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor So the reason this American father and his American son should have been denied the comfort of this woman at the child's deathbed is what now?  Something from the 1920s?  My grandstanding?
@WallyStummy @NellSco @KurtSchlichter @jack So you are saying that a child with American citizenship should be denied the comfort of his mother at his deathbed exactly why?
@WallyStummy And again, what does that have to do with a story about a child with American citizenship, his American father and a woman going through the legal visa process?
@WallyStummy @KenGardner11 For example, you could include the hot air exhaled by you when you brought up open borders and illegal immigration in a discussion of a child with American citizenship dying without his mother by his side.
There is a huge list of right-wing provocateurs who failed at show business.  @DanaLoesh comes to mind.  Some of the Fox &amp; Friends guys, I think?  Others? https://t.co/2yaYRO5slx
@WallyStummy @BoktaiRanger @DickYoungsGhost @NYCMayor Perhaps the problem is "open borders."  That seems to be your problem with everything.
@cjj1988 @perlmutations With his daughter?
@WallyStummy @NellSco @KurtSchlichter @jack The father and son in this situation were American citizens.  The wife was going through the proper legal channels to apply for a visa.  What does this have to do with "unvetted visitors from failed states," terrorism, drug smuggling or failure to enforce laws?
@WallyStummy The child in this tweet and his father are American citizens.  The mother was legally applying for a visa.  What on earth does that have to do with "unvetted visitors from failed states" and "open borders"?

@RAMRANTS https://t.co/SRjjstgoxN
@keksdisciple @1hairyman So you are saying the president wasn’t concerned about the safety of Americans, just politics.   I agree with you.
@RAMRANTS Now I disagree profoundly with your politics, but I do not in any way question your loyalty to or love for America and Americans.   I suggest you learn how to extend a belief like that to those with whom you disagree.
@oathkeeper1985 You don’t care that a child — an American citizen, by the way — lay dying without his mother by his bedside?
@RAMRANTS So you believe, with no evidence, that I am not a loyal American because only people with right-wing viewpoints can be loyal Americans?
@keksdisciple @1hairyman When Trump issued a travel ban, why didn’t Trump include the country from which the 9/11 terrorists came from?
@RAMRANTS You claim you didn’t know I was Jewish. Prove that.
@keksdisciple @1hairyman Sure. If there were no reason for the ban and it kept families apart, it was wrong.   Those who committed the worst attack on American soil, 9/11, were Saudi. Why wasn’t there a travel ban on Saudis?
@RAMRANTS https://t.co/OgRA8KKFrt
@RAMRANTS You are just going to continue to level slanderous unfounded accusations, eh?  When you say that my loyalty isn’t to the American people, I assume you’re referring to the common antisemitic canard that Jews cannot be loyal Americans.
@keksdisciple @1hairyman I know that no Yemeni committed an act of domestic terrorism in the U.S.  I know that an child with American citizenship lay dying without his mother.
@RAMRANTS You stand by the false accusation you leveled at me with no evidence to support it?  You stand by the unfounded ad hominem attack you made at me?  Got it.
@RPMcMurhpy @Woodcat0214 @AriFleischer @kathygriffin https://t.co/ISP4nPOaUc
@RPMcMurhpy @Woodcat0214 @AriFleischer @kathygriffin Actually, the dairy industry has been unable to find Americans willing to do the job. Go research.
@keksdisciple @1hairyman What terrorist attacks were committed in the U.S. by Yemeni that justified banner them?
@keksdisciple @1hairyman What terrorist attacks in the U.S. were committed by Yemeni?
@RAMRANTS There is no possible analysis of my twitter stream that supports your assertion.   I understand that you felt that insults and ad hominem attacks might advance your case. They didn’t.
@RAMRANTS Interesting.   In fact, if you use philanthropy as a guide, I have made major gifts to address poverty in the U.S. and none that would be associated with the needs of immigrants.   I have contributed to groups like the ACLU who fight for rights and the ADL which fights hate.
@keksdisciple Yes. She is Yemeni. Her husband is an American citizen as was her son.
Vaccinate! https://t.co/8Trg9pWXNx
@CRFlixxx @AnneWheaton Who do you think made up this story?
@RAMRANTS So I can accuse you of anything and the burden of proof is on you?  Absolutely absurd. You made an unfounded false and inflammatory accusation.   Prove you didn’t kill a man in Reno.
@keksdisciple How is America a foreign land to an American citizen?
@RAMRANTS According to you I “prioritize [illegal aliens] over American citizens.”  Back that up or apologize. https://t.co/MUIsnP3AuH
@keksdisciple The father and son were American citizens.
@RAMRANTS So you brought up something that was a) unrelated and b) false?  Explain to me what I believe, as I clearly fall into a group called “people like yourself” whose thoughts you can read.
@ScpoMe @RAMRANTS Tu quoque.
@RAMRANTS It was your response to my friend’s quoting my tweet.   Why bring up undocumented immigrants in a story about a child with American citizenship dying without his mother?
@RAMRANTS Why would you bring up undocumented immigrants in a story involving American citizens and legal applications for travel?  I thought you wanted people to “play by the rules”?
@RAMRANTS https://t.co/Bp2YTs1Oi8
@RAMRANTS Many Americans live abroad. What are you implying?
@RAMRANTS Yours did.
@RAMRANTS This is an American citizen with an American citizen child.   Why do you keep bringing up undocumented immigrants?
@CRFlixxx @AnneWheaton The father is an American citizen who married a Yemeni woman.   The child is American by birth.
Under “religious freedom,” they legalized discrimination against gay people. Now they want to extend that discrimination to Jews.   Someone should write a poem. https://t.co/oUpiJLECTW

@Mstewable Ah. You meant the tweet within the tweet.
@CRFlixxx @AnneWheaton The child was an American citizen.
@RAMRANTS This child was an American citizen and was denied the presence of his mother at his bedside as he lay dying.   Tell me again why we shouldn’t care?
@Mstewable Yes, Trump calling neo-Nazis “very fine people” is awful. Do you disagree?
@RAMRANTS The child was a U.S. citizen.
@Texas_Eric1 What judge?
@RAMRANTS 1. Father (and child) U.S. citizens.  2. Wife in process of applying for visa.  3. Child falls ill.  4. U.S. is slow-walking her visa application.  5. Trump travel ban enacted.  6.  Father takes child to U.S.for treatment.  7.  Mother barred.
@RAMRANTS She was barred from entry along with all Yemenis. Her husband was an American citizen who brought the child to the U.S. for treatment.
@Texas_Eric1 Not true.
@RAMRANTS Why should we stop a mother from being at the bedside of her dying child?

@aaronreagan625 @waronwankers Direct me to your tweet expressing outrage at the death of Heather Heyer.
@rmarculis @Wishingnhoping_ Sorry, I didn’t realize you objected to people practicing their religion.
@USA_First_2016 Yes, but we don’t have any idea where they are or what they’re doing.   Why is an undocumented Irishman okay and an undocumented Honduran not?
@USA_First_2016 If you are coming from a country like the U.K., France, Italy, Ireland, Canada, etc., you do not have to apply for a visa.  You have automatic permission to stay for 90 days.  No medical.  No background check.  The bartender down the street has been here for 10 years.
@USA_First_2016 They do not fill out any medical info.  I have many friends who have visited from the UK, France and Ireland.  They have provided no medical information whatsoever.  We know nothing more about them (including where they are and what they're doing) than any other undocumented.
@USA_First_2016 Nope.  False.
@USA_First_2016 If you arrive in the U.S. from a Western European country, you do not need to seek a visa in advance.  You just show up, present your passport and you can stay for 90 days.  No exam.  The bartender down the street has been here for 10 years.
@KurtSchlichter Where do you stand on Heather Heyer?
@macnificentone So you're saying that having a T-shirt policy (exactly the same as Disneyland) is equivalent to mocking a mother's pain at losing her child?  You are odd.
@USA_First_2016 I have friends who visited me from Ireland and the UK.  They are granted a 90-day visa upon entering.  No medical exam.  No background check.  You are just making things up.
@USA_First_2016 There is evidence of an organized effort on the part of the Trump companies to knowingly employ undocumented workers and assist them in forging papers.  Remember, Trump had to pay millions in a settlement over employing undocumented construction workers.
@aaronreagan625 @waronwankers So you're saying it's Christian to show contempt for a mother's love for her child?  Guess I don't get Christianity then.
@sequoiagaia @kathygriffin Not aware of Kathy ever showing contempt for a mother's love for her child.
@Shgamha Sure we can.  It's called math.  We know the size of the populations, and we know the number convicted with violent crimes.  Then you divide.
@USA_First_2016 If undocumented immigrants represent such a grave threat, why do the Trump companies continue to employ them?
@Shouryureppa @USA_First_2016 What was the proposition I made that qualified?
@USA_First_2016 Background checks and medical checks?  Really?  The Irish bartender down the street from me who's been here illegally for a decade had a background check and a medical check?  Tell me about that?  You make up the craziest stuff.
@Shgamha The reference is to violent crime.  Immigrants, regardless of status, commit violent crime at a rate lower than native-born Americans.
@Shouryureppa @USA_First_2016 You don't seem to understand what "straw man" (two words, no hyphen) means.
@AiderNr @SDavld In that case, the vast majority of terrorist acts and mass shootings in the U.S. were committed by people with right-wing politics and Saudis.
@USA_First_2016 False.  https://t.co/3E1q25laTp
@USA_First_2016 How do the majority of immigrants present "illegally" in the U.S. enter?
@USA_First_2016 The majority of immigrants present "illegally" in the United States came here by airplane.
@USA_First_2016 I don't have any data on your first claim.  Your second claim is false.  According to Justice Department data from the last five available years, around 60 to 75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings.
@Shouryureppa @USA_First_2016 My point is that immigrants (documented and undocumented) commit fewer violent crimes than native-born Americans.  Can you find another historical example where the crimes of a group are highlighted to create a false impression they are dangerous?
@USA_First_2016 Show me some statistics.
@rmarculis @Wishingnhoping_ They've certainly killed more people.
@USA_First_2016 How do you know Mexico is safe?  The U.S. State Department has declared vast sections of the country unsafe due to gang violence.  Why should we believe you instead of the State Department?
@AiderNr @SDavld You don't seem to know what a decade is.
@USA_First_2016 Why are you more concerned about the southern border than the method by which the majority of undocumented immigrants enter the U.S.?
@AiderNr @SDavld Curious why all the discussions of undocumented immigrants are about the southern border when the majority arrive through airports.
@USA_First_2016 The law says they get a hearing.  Do you object to following the law?
@AiderNr You seem concerned about violence.  The vast majority of domestic terror attacks and mass shootings in the past decade were committed by individuals with right-wing ideology.  What should we do about that?
@USA_First_2016 You seem concerned about violence.  The vast majority of domestic terror attacks and mass shootings in the past decade were committed by individuals with right-wing ideology.  What should we do about that?
@SDavld @AiderNr Or the fact that the vast majority of domestic terror attacks and mass shootings in the past decade were committed by individuals with right-wing ideology.
@USA_First_2016 Those fleeing Central American violence (which has its roots in American foreign policy) face danger in Mexico as the reach of gangs extends there.  True or false: it is legal to apply for asylum regardless of immigration status.
@USA_First_2016 How did it start?  How did it make it to Central America?

@USA_First_2016 True or false: it is legal to seek asylum in the Untied States regardless of how you entered.
@USA_First_2016 It is legal to seek asylum regardless of how you entered the country.
@USA_First_2016 It is legal to enter the United States and seek asylum.
@USA_First_2016 It is legal to enter the United States and seek asylum.
@RivalThoughts2 Hm.  Seems to be missing condemnation of a mother trying to care for her dying child.  Fail.
@AiderNr If an undocumented immigrant committing murder means all undocumented immigrants are bad, does a Trump supporter killing Heather Heyer mean all Trump supporters are bad?  If not, why not?
@USA_First_2016 If an undocumented immigrant committing murder means all undocumented immigrants are bad, does a Trump supporter killing Heather Heyer mean all Trump supporters are bad?  If not, why not?
@USA_First_2016 The study is about all immigrants -- documented and undocumented.  Read it.
@USA_First_2016 If an undocumented immigrant committing murder means all undocumented immigrants are bad, does a Trump supporter killing Heather Heyer mean all Trump supporters are bad?  If not, why not?
@USA_First_2016 Because the two things are unrelated.

@BenzaminRush Are you saying that calling someone a woman is an insult?
@LindaMcCorkle I have been trying to understand what that means for years.
@neovictorian23 Heather Heyer.
@USA_First_2016 All murder is tragic. All murder is to be condemned.   At the same time, immigrants, documented and undocumented, commit violent crimes at a rate lower than the native born.   In the 1930s, Hitler had newspapers publish crimes committed by Jews even though they were law-abiding.

@Texas_Eric1 Well, the New York Times doesn't pay for interviews, but thanks for completely inventing something without evidence to try to explain why a woman who literally made Trump's bed was undocumented.  You're working really hard to explain away Trump's hypocrisy.  Kudos.
@Texas_Eric1 No, he is just the CEO of an org with a problem that goes on for decades (first case 1993) and he cannot stop it.  So he's just completely ineffective.  I accept this explanation.
@Texas_Eric1 So there's a problem going on in the Trump Org for decades, year after year, and Trump can't stop it?  Got it.
@Texas_Eric1 Oh, so that women is here legally but she went public and claimed to be undocumented?  Got it.  You have the best explanations!
@Texas_Eric1 You need to do a little research on the structure of the Trump Org.  Trump has publicly boasted that he is "hands on" and knows "everything that goes on."  Guess he was lying, eh?
@Texas_Eric1 And I completely accept your explanation that Trump was too stupid to know what his employees had been doing for decades.  You have explained this very well.
@Texas_Eric1 So you are saying the president wasn't smart enough to know his employees were deceiving him?  Okay, I'll buy that.
@Texas_Eric1 Nope.  Look at the structure of the Trump Org -- they hire directly.  Here is an undocumented worker that literally made Trump's bed for years.  One of many employed by Trump cos.  https://t.co/Ix4r9v21bn
@Texas_Eric1 Sorry -- I've run operations that have employed hundreds of people.  If there is a decades-long problem with hiring undocumented workers, that would be on me.  But if you want to defend Trump by saying he was an inept CEO, I won't argue.
@Texas_Eric1 So when he claims to be the best CEO and manager, it's just a lie?  Oh look -- here's Trump paying a huge settlement for hiring undocumented workers:  https://t.co/48ddTbloEF

@womensmarch I love you guys and want to promote you. Let’s straighten out the antisemitism thing, ok?

@chrislhayes @gtconway3d Hint:  it rhymes with “conclusion.”
@TheBrodyFile It’s two words.  And yes, visiting the troops — after Christmas and after a flurry of stories pointing out that he was the first president since 2002 to not visit the troops at Christmas (he still is) — will give him political cover when he travels to Mar-a-Lago for NYE.
@connie_delaney @kjoerwin Because the optics of traveling to a lavish party while the government is shut down and government workers are going without paychecks is awful.  Visiting the troops gives him something to point to to change the subject.
@FOLLOWROBWRIGHT Andrew Jackson died of heart failure at home at age 78.
@AircraftSpots Can this be tracked on a website?
@TheBrodyFile 1.  He did not visit them at Christmas.  2.  “Oy gevalt” is two words, not hyphenated.  3.  Any particular reason you’re using Yiddish when speaking to a Jewish person?  Do you speak Yiddish, or do you feel I don’t understand English?

@free_stacy Ah, so your justification for Trump going back on his word and causing the shutdown is that everyone does it. Neat. Can you give me an example of Reagan or the Bushes or Clinton or Obama going back on their words and causing a shutdown?
@free_stacy So you agree he changed his mind. There was a deal to keep the government open. Trump was on board and he went back on his word. Got it.
@free_stacy Really?  The Senate voted unanimously on a bill to keep the government open—a bill Trump promised he would sign.   He changed his mind when they made fun of him on Fox News.

@TurlsD @Kebrinks How many took vacations during government shutdowns?
@KimCamarato @RobertaSaidThat Yes.  AF1 couldn’t be used solely to take him to FL during a partial government shutdown.  Also the political blowback that existed for not visiting troops on Xmas would have exploded if he traveled to Mar-a-Lago.  This gives him the ability to use AF1 and political cover.
And even if he doesn’t fly direct, the act of visiting the troops will be cover for New Year’s Eve at Mar-a-Lago.

@zoll_p Trump doesn't live in Florida. He vacations in Florida.
Pay attention. He will fly to Florida now.
ATTENTION JOURNALISTS:  If Trump is secretly en route to visit troops, ask if he will be returning to DC or FL.   The trip will be cover to get to Mar-a-Lago NYE party where tickets were sold guaranteeing access to the president.   He would be using the troops as a distraction.
There are reports that Trump may be secretly en route to visit troops.  Guarantee:  he will return to FL, not DC.  He has to make it to Mar-a-Lago for NYE because he sold party tickets that guaranteed access to the president.  The troop visit will give him cover.
@leahmcelrath That’s not the whole story, Leah.  He sold a lot of tickets to the NYE party at Mar-a-Lago.  Access to the president was baked into the price.  Flying to visit troops will give him cover to return to FL instead of DC.  Can’t disappoint the paying customers.
@MollyJongFast @MrJonCryer He is going to Mar-a-Lago. Visiting the troops is cover.   He sold a lot of tickets to the NYE party and has to get there.
@andylassner @yashar He needs to get to Florida for the NYE party. Can’t use AF1 b/c of shutdown. Visit to safe base (Germany?) lets him return to Florida.   Can’t disappoint all the customers who paid for access to him.

@BullsLawDan Actually, that’s easy.   If you are in a march with many people carrying swastika flags and shouting Nazi slogans, you are either a neo-Nazi or someone perfectly comfortable with neo-Nazi.   The term for someone perfectly comfortable with neo-Nazis is “neo-Nazi.”  All done.

@BullsLawDan Nope. I have the facts correct. There were two groups gathered — neo-Nazis and counter protesters.  Trump referred to “very fine people” on both sides. One side was only neo-Nazis.  And the number of racist and antisemitic incidents is on the rise.  Period.  Life in the Trump era
