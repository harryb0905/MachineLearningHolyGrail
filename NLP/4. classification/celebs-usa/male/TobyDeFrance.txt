@timhames ur applying the letter not spirit of the law. He asked his team mate to get him food from the car. Hardly blameless. #tdf
It starts with "C" and sounds like "heating" @mattrabin - do you want to solve the puzzle? #TdF #FeedCheats
@ksavje @bambula certainly looks like Richie took water +/- food from the car. That's 100% against the rules #TdF
Do the #TdF commissaires have the swingers to DQ Porte or time dock Froome?? #FeedCheats
Riblon looking like he'll pinch the Queen Stage!! Beautifully timed ride. #TdF
Well that's hardly fair. Froome gets fed and watered in the final 5km from the car. #UnSporting #TdF

@monki71 none intended. Tried politeness earlier, but you ignored. I think bigger sticks don't stop cheats. Same as in law.
@monki71 Dude. I'm sure you had a point. I missed it somewhere between your 3rd &amp; 4th tweets. It's twitter, not essayer.
V true @rosscosmart - they're both perpetrators &amp; victims of their own misdeeds. No job if uncompetitive &amp; all were cheats: #Catch22
So GreenEdge &amp; Sky rule out 90% of riders (&amp; staff) of #Pharmstrong era as employees. Any directors available anywhere at all?
@monki71 how much of that is about the peloton now? Cycling's changed. Still more to do, but its a (mostly) clean sport these days.
@monki71 Slow down. Or write succinctly. Cyclists HAVE changed. Look at times up climbs. More still to do for sure, but much better.
@monki71 Garmin have it the right way. Sky &amp; GreenEdge are being excessive, draconian &amp; PR dictated.
@monki71 maybe so. I don't know of any other instance where admitting to past indiscretions = life bans. Frankly unfair &amp; excessive.
Ridiculously PR reaction from @Orica_GreenEDGE re: Matt White. Sacked for bad behav 10yr ago in a diff job for a diff company. Ridiculous.

@regsf @1bigbikeracefan two strikes. By your own standards, you're out.
@regsf @1bigbikeracefan What's your source for that? Wikipedia says he rode for an Italian team. Don't make stuff up, just dislike him!
@regsf @1bigbikeracefan heh. No sweat! And yes, I agree that the big dogs who let this happen have a lot to answer for.
@coop_smithy fully agree. To see 1 rider's circumstance, read bottom page 111-114 of the USADA summary http://t.co/nUBL7L2j Ouch.
@regsf are you talking about Lance now? @1bigbikeracefan and I were talking about Matt White.
@jbhogfat Thanks John.
@coop_smithy that is a #SlipperySlope (illogical) argument. I had no idea he cheated, &amp; we have no idea the circumstances behind why
It's good he's come clean @1bigbikeracefan but he's doing great work now, and hopefully will be able to continue to do so!
@nickmcguirk officially Garmin sacked him for breaking a rule they backdated. Actually they sacked him cos they knew he was off to OGE
@nickmcguirk #FactFail he got it from his work as DS at Garmin, cycling's clean team (with 3 confessors in dossier)
It's already started @X_Clem_X - @anthony_tan has judged from on high already!
Feel sad for a good man who has admitted to bad things (drug use in his past). Matt White still has my support. http://t.co/Cow2hPiM

@au_sesquip Maybe Lance could henceforth just be known as Asterisk or LanceStar or Lance*
@au_sesquip @daveih Riis is winner* as opposed to winner. http://t.co/4ekhsSNE I don't like it, but #ItIsWhatItIs
@au_sesquip @daveih Riis already has.  It's done, and has been for years.
Fully agree @au_sesquip - it is all tainted and extremely disappointing.
Was he fraudulent @daveih in not falling off his bike, nor making any racing errors for 147 days? Doped or not, he was the best.
Read Millar's book @daveih &amp; see the era he raced in. &amp; having seen how much can go wrong during a race, that he won x7 is amazing
That said, he was by FAR the best bike racer of his time. His results are amazing regardless. No way should he be stripped of his wins
The #Armstrong non-contest but vehement denial to me is a concession that they have him on toast and he doesn't want the humiliation

@Kimbo_Ramplin a great question of the age. Similar to my fave: "What's the opposite of defenestration?" #Digression
@Kimbo_Ramplin so is that a de-sherliggetism or a sherliggetised #sherliggetism ??

Go Cadel!! #TdF
So it looks like the best two contenders on TT are in the best 3 on steep climbs! #ToughGig to beat them! #TdF
Sky doing a US Postal circa 2000. Not talking anything dodgy, more their annihilation of the whole field. #TDF12 #TdF
@Kimbo_Ramplin good win. Did ya see me on the field?? Heh. Who you on tonight? Dan Martin for me #TdF
your thoughts @mrendell ? No bet hedgery- Dan Martin for the win for mine as I blogged earlier http://t.co/Pd1Ux2cf
reckon Dan Martin from Nibali from Cadel today @Nhughz http://t.co/Pd1Ux2cf

Ryder in the front group @Nhughz - your bet is still alive!! #TdF
Sagan absolutely taking the piss. Unbelievable. Un.Be.Lei. you know the rest. #TdF
Evans a little edgy there and slowed the chase down! Chavanel a good chance. #TdF
Got him!  About two thirds back. Phew! I'll shut up now...  #TdF
Still haven't seen a Garmin jersey up front. Hope Hesje is still in the mix!! #TdF
Right. Dan's dragging VDV back. Crap result for Garmin. VDV looks amazing! V bad timing #TdF
Old dogs head to head. The Jensie &amp; Big George.  Love it! Thanks for the memories boys. #TdF

“@ChristianVDV: Hip-hop all night long tonight at the club tonight. Yup. You know who won. In ypur face.” HAHAHAHAHAAAA. So Hesje!!
Great stage of the #Giro - it all comes down to the TT tomorrow!
J-Rod stomping the last 400m. Great ride. Now Hesje... Get home!! Looks like he's dropped back to about 30s coming into the TT
Come on Ryder! Respond!!!!
Love the Italian TV directors! Barely get to see the pink jersey. Looks like J-Rod has hit  only in th last km #Giro
De Gendt wins the stage and the clock starts!! #Giro
Scarponi clips off the front of Hesje. Now what will J-Rod do? #Giro under 2km out
Hesje has popped Pozzovivo and Basso!! Absolute gun!! De Gendt ripping it up and well in contention for the overall podium #Giro
Hahah! Shades of #Sherliggetisms there @Kimbo_Ramplin with the carrot chasing the rabbit!
The big diesel of Hesje keeping on trucking! 7 blokes remaining behind him. All big dogs. 5km to go. #Giro
Hesje goes with Gadret's 2nd move!! Others looked less quick. #Giro Gadret's 3rd leaves all behind
Love VDV's work!! Gun. #giro
this is harder than the #TdF @CarloVerzeletti but brilliant viewing and racing for exactly that reason! #Giro
De Gendt riding like a man possessed. 7.5km out, looking like he can ride onto the podium at the #Giro tomorrow! Amazing!
Am beside myself watching @ChristianVDV and @Ryder_Hesjedal do their thing at the #Giro. Go Hesje!!
@miketomalaris and @mwkeenan - love the SBS #giro coverage, but they're pronounced "HEZ je dahl" (not a soft J) and "STETna"
Holy Hesje, Batman! He's gonna win the #Giro if he keeps that up for TWO more days! Go Hesje!
Good call @iatebrisbane - @mummavegas and I had a great #DateNight at Anise #bneliving #DegustationDream
Lance was wrong @nickwrobbins It's ALL about the bike!! Make sure you're properly set up.
Swannie-ology 101 @davecasey1 - the feedzone is terrifying: DON'T MOVE! Help out wherever, and sleep whenever, you can!
Dead right @Merrett21! @hamishnews has broken one of THE scandals of Aus Foreign Policy. Journalism: #NotDeadYet
V happy for Hesje holding the Pink Jersey! Garmin having a go on GC at the #Giro finally &amp; it pays off.
Great day at the #giro for Garmin @Ride_Argyle - stage win, pink jersey, and VDV gets past Stage 3!! He's up for a big #TdF !

Pretty sure Madison style hand slings are banned from road cycling... what is going on with Movistar doms on the final hill??

Will be interesting @stakes14! Washed up never-was taking pro athletes on a training ride. #WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong
Reading @Millarmind book Racing Through The Dark. Great evocation of #TdF '09 Barca: I'm nervous all over again!
In breaking news, the sun will rise in the east today, and Cav is joining Team Sky.
@millarmind I disagree mate. That would be much better to watch than the Indian File processions of distance running
@stu_knight80 VO2 stuff isn't my bag mate. Best training tip I have is consistency is king. Be regular!
Quade Cooper: now challenging Greg Norman for Australia's biggest #choke
And also, chapeau to Team GB for withstanding everything the Aussies threw at them. Great racing #RoadWorlds
The pain of an interwebs fail for me at the race. Couldn't tweet a thing! Bugger.
Race day finally! Come on Aussies! #RoadWorlds
Quiet at #RoadWorlds camp as the TT boys check the course. Not too technical, wind & weather will factor a lot.

So happy Svein Tuft has a ride with @GreenEDGE No doubt they recall Svein's grand rouleur work @ Garmin.
I won't be there @inspiredinvegas - would love to, but my next cycling gig is Copenhagen for Worlds.
at Brown Dog in Brisbane @CarloVerzeletti it was good coffee made poorly. As I said #MacchiatoFail

It's not a #sherliggettisms but the number of "Tour de Force" headlines in Aus today has been painful! #TdF
Hahaha! So Cav gets number 20! The man is a phenom. Congrats to all #TdF finishers chapeau. Have a good night!
Funny @Norbert68 I am a broken human and am almost no chance of making Stage finish awake! Great #TdF #BringOnJuly2012
This has been a #TdF for grand upsets. So my money is on Ty Farrar for the win today! http://t.co/cLJEoXr
Thanks for the pump-up @megawatty ! I clearly love it, so it's a bit of a self indulgence too! Bring on next year!! #TdF
Desperate Procession #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7J
There may have been some celebratory consumption @stakes14 #ScullForCadel was the patriotic thing to do #TdF
It certainly took the edge off our loss @stakes14. Btw, Cadel won the #TdF last night!! Hahaha!
Cadel will win the #TdF for 2011! Hahahaha! So awesome! http://t.co/LGPAIpr
A Grand Victory http://wp.me/pSim5-7H
@Nhughz Cav will win it mañana - play it safe is not a possibility #TdF
Standings: 1st C Evans. 2nd +1'34" A Schleck. You bloody beauty!! #TdF
Best Aussie sporting result since 1983 #TdF
YES!!! Fantastic Cadel!!! #TdF
I'm going to say it again, just because I can!! Cadel just won the #TdF
Cadel just won the #TdF
All hail Cadel Evans, champ of #TdF 2011. So happy for him! #TdF
because @curium I'm in a small country town that doesn't have @eurosportuktv - Melbourne. Hahaha!! #TdF
@rainesy29 ratified
Great ride from Cadel Evans!!! Just won the #TdF with a ride of genuine panache
COME ON CADEL!!! #TdF
Can we please get off the #sherliggettisms "Voyckler" bandwagon. He fought like a lion, but seriously... #TdF
3km to go. Cadel is so deep in the hurt box. But so far up on Andy #TdF
Cadel is going to win the Tour!!! You bloody beauty!! #TdF
Will say right now that this has been the best #TdF in years. Prior to Cadel winning it that is!
Cadel Evans has won the world champs, had come 2nd twice in the Tour de France, and is looking at winning the Tour this year #TdF
2nd time check, Cadel is only 7s down on Tony Martin. Andy on his best day couldn't even dream about going that well on a TT #TdF
Cadel is apparently 18sec in front of Andy #TdF
our man is looking very freaking good @rockwiz38 - am losing my cool right now!! #TdF
Cadel is the virtual leader of the #TdF by 5" COME ON CADEL!!!!!!
Cadel is dancing at 56-57" better than Andy!!! Come on Cadel!! #TdF
COME ON CADEL!!!!!!!!!!!!! #TdF
Cadel had taken 53" out of Andy!!! Come on mate!!! #TdF
@GregCan love the way they raced, not the way they complain about stuff. #TdF
Cadel has taken 44" out of Andy now!!! Hope he hasn't overcooked his front end! #TdF
@GregCan meh
Happy B'day Seth. Ba I love you
I am so nervous! Busting for a wee! Can't leave tv. Need at catheter. Cadel has taken 30" out of Andy at this point!! #TdF
Cadel at 21" at first time check. Hoping Andy gets there in 6'57" time!! #TdF
#sherliggettisms "Schleck is the people's champion" the people are idiots #TdF
The TV feed @mrtiedt
Cadel has taken 15s out of Andy already. 42" to go! Come on Cadel!! #TdF
this year @jazzzzdude ?? He has moaned since arriving on the pro bike scene! #TdF
@jcazana @procyclinglive he'll "focus" the shit out of it! #TdF
I think Cadel can win it. #TdF #blatantlybiased
Andy looks like he's going to pooh his pants. Not a confident looking man #TdF
Come on Cadel! #TdF
#sherliggettisms @Kimbo_Ramplin Phil finally said Voeckler, not Voyckler #TdF
Can't believe Alberto blew the start. Hope the big three don't have such an issue. #TdF
Ya gotta cover the full distance @rainesy29 - everyone has to finish every stage. TT included! #TdF
I'm taking the vibe of Porte beating Fabs as a sign for Aussies vs Leopards. #TdF
Down To Two #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7D
Attack! Attack! #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7B
Cadel needs to get 57" out of Andy tomorrow. Isn't out of it, but also isn't a guarantee. Bring on tomorrow #TdF
Evans was magnificent today. Closed the break down solo, and then attacked Andy up the hill. Great bike racing! #TdF
Hilarious that Rolland is now the toast of France, not Voeckler. Will be a funny dinner table tonight #TdF
Rolland looks like he will win it today. Great stuff! #TdF
Rolland is in the lead!! He won't know what to do with himself! Is a wheel sucker par excellence #TdF
Hahaha @Kimbo_Ramplin - I did notice the lack of waiting from Andy #TdF
What is Andy asking Cadel for? He can complain the shit out of it #TdF
Contador riding beautifully. Cadel looking pretty good. Should attack Andy shortly. #TdF
Remember, Comtador started attacking 97km from the finish today. This #TdF has been spectacular
Cadel still in the #schlecksandwich looking at Andy, he's in the hurt basket. Should attack at some point today. #TdF
Cadel in the #schlecksandwich #TdF
I'm pretty sure Voeckler has cracked four or five times today. Man has guts. #TdF
Contador looking amazing. Chapeau. Come on Cadel! Attack Schleck! Bugger the TT! Do it today! #TdF
Cadel should attack. Schleck looks empty. Cooked. Busted. Etc. #TdF
Go on Hesje! Roll your tempo mate! #weightofanation #TdF
Go again Cadel! And also go Hesje! TdF
Evans is attacking! Wonders will never cease #TdF
This mountain is so cool! Come on Hesje! #weightofanation #TdF
Frank's on the front!?!? That's a change! #TdF
Go Hesje! Would love Ryder winning stage and Cadel not lose a second on Schlecks. Biased! Moi? #TdF
I didn't think it could get any better than last night. I was wrong #TdF
Ryder and Cadel drag it down to 11sec! Boom! Gaaaaaaame onnnnnnn!!! #TdF
Ryder's a gun @Kimbo_Ramplin @AshHofie and doesn't roll that way #TdF
@miketomalaris ask him if he's going to eat a shoe if Cadel wins (from commentary at worlds) #TdF #footinmouth
I'll take Don Julio tequila thanks @Kimbo_Ramplin @miketomalaris #sherliggettisms
Great call @Kimbo_Ramplin @miketomalaris on #sherliggettisms re: beast of a climb calls #TdF
Cadeloton at 20" gogogogogogo!!! Come on! #TdF
Cadeloton smoking it up on the descent. Hesje helping out. Bring it all back boys!! #TdF
Voeckler isn't upset @theCLEcyclist he's a broken man! Doing interpretive dance on his bike at hilltop #TdF
Cadeloton at 30" or so! Man can ride. Descend! Descend like crazy! #TdF
Ok. Now Voeckler isn't there, no worries that Europcar aren't working #TdF
Voeckler has 2 freaking teammates sitting in! Have a freaking go! #TdF
#sherliggettisms @Kimbo_Ramplin Schleck has dark glasses to keep himself concentrated. #TdF
Can Voeckler please put a teammate on the front please? He personally has defended manfully, but use your bloody team!!! #TdF
Cadeloton at 70" now. Really unlucky he had that mechanical #TdF
Cadeloton at 85" ish. Needs to descend like a mad banshee. #TdF
Voeckler doing interpretive dance on his bike. Not the prettiest climbing... #TdF
Voeckler finally blows. Finally. Cadeloton at 1'45" ish #TdF
Lead cars barraged. Voeckler will catch them. This is ludicrous. #TdF
Voeckler matching Schleck & Contador chopping off. Hmmmmmmm #TdF
Hahaha @Kimbo_Ramplin reverse #sherliggettisms - wonders will never cease!
I bloody love George Hincapie! On front for Cadel. 100sec gap behind Frank & Bertie #TdF
Schleck & Alberto cooperating. Massive trouble for Cadel. Is nigh on 2' down. Ugly. #TdF
Cadeloton dropped 20" more on descent. Now at 90" to Contador and Andy. #TdF
Great work Pineau helping Voeckler out. Great work Voeckler thanking him at top #TdF Love this sport!
Rear wheel/derailleur issue. Has changed bike and dropped 70s all in one hit. Bad luck #TdF
Evans has massive mechanical drama. Needs to drag time back steadily, not all at once. Bad timing! #TdF
Voeckler has produced 4 of the rides of the decade this race. @stampinlibby He's riding out of his skin!
If time cut was enforced, there would be 4 blokes finishing on the Champs Élysées! #TdF
This is amazing! Contador, Andy and Cadel away. With Voeckler. Frank off back. 90km out. #TdF
Ummm. They're attacking. Already. Holy crap! 97km to go #TdF
Europcar: the only team to hold the yellow jersey and not lead the race. Awesome use of weakness being their strength #TdF
Big night tonight. Cadel is in a #Schlecksandwich #TdF hope he nails it http://t.co/IFh0TnW
One More #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7y
One For The History Books #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7u
He's ridden brilliantly @inspiredinvegas - no hate. But talk of GC 2012? He got a free 4' on stage 9! He's no contender #TdF
@guyrae @general18 hahaha! Got kissed on the dick to gain the yellow, then had HTC, Leopard & BMC ride for him. Genius! #TdF
Ding! Lightbulb! @civetta has noted Rolland is for white jersey. Right. Still think this Voeckler love fest is ludicrous #TdF
Tomalaris and Tan talking Voeckler for podium. What the??? Who is he beating? Cadel, Andy or Frank? Ridiculous. #TdF
@general18 yeah, but as a watcher of races, I can appreciate panache. Why hold fire on using Rolland? #TdF
Voeckler keeps jersey, but... meh. What was the point of Rolland not riding tempo, and getting dropped 1.5km out? LAME! #TdF
Cadel has done a great job here. Has conceded 2'15" to Andy. #TdF
Andy has genuinely popped. Cadel dragging time off him hand over fist. #TdF
Oh get out of here. Europcar take lead in final 2km. Cowardly sniveling bike racing. #TdF
Magnificent ride by Andy. And also a courageous defense by Cadel. Good bike racing here #TdF
Contador off the back!!! Well I never. #TdF
Cadel getting set up by Contador I reckon. Will be attacked in final km or two #TdF
5km and 3'15" Andy vs Cadel. Voeckler still has teammate, still won't contribute. Lame lame lame #TdF
Sanchez in Barney Rubble. #TdF
Seriously don't rate how passive Voeckler is. Has a teammate and won't defend his jersey. Lame. #TdF
8km and 3'55" for Andy. Big push by Cadel, no other helpers  #TdF
Sanchez cracked #TdF or cracking...
10km and 4'30" for Andy. This is looking a great move! Sanch, Cont & Cadel gotta go. Cadel attacks #TdF
Evans is clearly perplexed. Not sure what to do. I believe "chase" would be his answer. #TdF
Woah. Contador stops riding. Cadel in a looooot of trouble. If Voyckler had any class he'd get Roland to ride #TdF
Cade taking a turn. Where's Sanchez? #TdF
Contador takes the burden of covering Andy. Cade sitting on for now. #TdF
Domestiques getting cooked trying to chase Andy! 4min gap approaching with 16km to go #TdF
Great parachute material tracksuit on dude by the road at 20km to go. #TdF
Pity the Euskatel boys are all skinny mountain goats! Can't take any time out of Andy group like this #TdF
Devenyns has obviously named his price! #TdF
Schleck is over 3min up on main bunch. BMC, Saxo & Euskatel seem to organise finally. #TdF
Garmin may help on chase to defend team lead. Need organization! #TdF
"Stephen Roche" #sherliggettisms
Hahaha! Can see a slightly brown stain on Rochey's knicks as Schleck caught him. #TdF
Reckon Andy should be throwing serious cash at his break mates to help out! #TdF
@imacsweb Voeckler is no hope no way no how #TdF
Freakin courageous move by Andy. Big question will be if it pays off or not. Puts Frank in the money seat #TdF
Schleck can't TT all that well. Surely Cadel and Contador can put bodies up road to drag him back in valley #tdf
Boom. Andy up by 1 minute. Wow! It is ON!! #TdF
Still no time gaps to Andy. Cadel has Bookwalter on front too. #tdf
@dqpryor shit sorry man!
Sanchez & Contador put lads on the front to try and cover it #TdF
Andy attacks 60km out with 2 of his men up the road. Interesting! #tdf
Jens & Stuey drop 2 teammates. Not ideal tactics! #TdF
I wouldn't go that far @rosscosmart - the Schlecks & Bertie put 4min into Lance, Wiggo & VDV in #TdF '09 - he's equal favourite!
Haha @rosscosmart Bertie le Boeuf! he has 2' up his sleeve over next 2 stages. If he keeps loss under that he wins #TdF
@Kimbo_Ramplin how about "Voyckler" and "Boysen-Hagen" #sherliggettisms
Nice sunnies @mattrabin - you and SoSo in the car today? Say flock of sheep to her for me! Hahaha!
#sherliggettisms @Kimbo_Ramplin Gold! I loathe a rider is "concentrated." What? Has he been distilled or something? #TdF
I meant Voeckler @KandiceBuys his TT skills are... ahem... pedestrian. No chance in hell he can win #TdF
Voeckler has been overtaken by glaciers during TTs @stampinlibby He. Can. Not. Win. The #TdF
big hitters day @rosscosmart 4700m vertical! Yowza! I reckon Cont, Sanch, ASchleck for #tdf stage http://t.co/Ub3S7vu
thanks @Kimbo_Ramplin ! Voeckler. Can. Not. Win. The. #TdF Stop saying it Sherwen!!
If Sherwen continues to pumps  up as a potential  #TdF winner I will cry. Can. Not. Win. No. Way. No. How.
Nuthin weird about beers, 2 Aussies & an old muscleman flick during a race @kathrynebrown
Already near 1st climb. Key escapees - 2 from Leopard & 2 from BMC. Help late in stage for Cadel & Schlecks #TdF
I'm not going to be at #ToB @kathrynebrown : DAMN! In Brisbane working with Aussie Rules. Conan night rocked!
4 Stages, 4 Contenders #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7r
As You Were #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7o
Shutting it. Good stage. Badly covered by tv. Hope no Frenchies a threat to win tomorrow - we'll miss the show! #TdF
Hahaha @ClarkeyAC and he flew off road twice after Ligget talked up his descending skillz. #tdf
No time gained for Spainos on any of the favorites. Voeckler & Basso drop more time. All set up for 2 epic stages! #TdF
Basso behind Voeckler. Evans behind Spainos. #tdf
Contador & Sanchez clear of everyone else. No idea where others are. #tdf
Show the effing race you effing French buffoons! #tdf
One Schleck still there. ?Evans in 5th? Hard to tell. 4th stage win for Norway!! #tdf
Voeckler blows corner. Sanchez, Contador flying downhill. #tdf
Guns over the top now. Will Schleck lose more time? Has he got the yips? #tdf
Descent will be carnage for leaders if they race it. #tdf
On like donkey kong b/w Schlecks & Bertie! #tdf
Contador again off Schleck's shoulder #tdf
Contador away. All cover it. #tdf
Eddie tha Boss doin it for Sky & Norway again. Show us the real bloody race now puhleeease! #TdF
All of France on Chavanel to win today. Last chance saloon for a Frenchy stage win. #tdf B Hagen away though
THE BIG GUNS! SHOW THE BIG GUNS! Sheesh. #tdf
Show us the race leaders you dopes!! #TdF
Like a Spring Classic how desperate teams are for position! Ride safe lads!! #TdF
All teams of hitters HUMMING to get position for their gun riders! Schlecks are scared! #TdF
Perez looks pretty good @Culbert_Report The man can climb.  #tdf You see @stakes14 tweet last night? Pure gold!
Alright! Up for the final 22km. Waiting to see what's what now! #TdF
Attempting the sleep now, watch the end theory. Work is in the way of my #TdF watching!
I reckon Coppel, Chavanel, Moncoutie @aaronhully17 @Nhughz http://t.co/pemiBJQ #TdF
Dare We Guess? http://wp.me/pSim5-7l
Schlecks Shaken #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-7e
Boss of bunch yells out piano (softly) and the break goes. Italian thing (I think)@JamesPayne5 #TdF
I'm on the big Canuck to take the win. #TdF
Hesje in the break with Thor. Garmin on a great #tdf
Peloton have called piano!! Break should stick now #TdF
Ludicrously, the break is still not clear!! Hesje still dangling off the front 96km in bugger-all time! #TdF
Wow. At feed zone and break not yet established. Rare. #TdF
Great to see a start to a stage, looking at how tough it is to get in the break! #TdF
Hesje, JohnnyBreakaway shooting for the break 83km to go. Hesje hard to resist when in breakm #TdF
Back Swinging #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-79
Over Already? #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-77
And Now... (No And Then) http://t.co/IL8h3Iv #TdF
And Now... (No And Then) http://wp.me/pSim5-72
3 mountain stages & brave Lions loss today: I'm done. Montpellier = scene of Garmin heroics '09. Tyler for the win! #TdF
Finally, Sanchez takes 25s and Andy 2s on other big hitters. No other major changes. #TdF
You can't say "what's he on" @miketomalaris No good.
Amazing results for Vanendert and Voeckler. Great result for Cadel. Ok for Sanchez. All others disappointed. #TdF
Race done. Voeckler loses no time, Vanendert wins. Sanchez takes 20ish sec, Andy 2 or 3sec, all else same time. #tdf
Andy smokes it. Will get a few secs. #tdf
Everyone looking around. 1km out. Minor gaps, if any for hitters. #tdf
Vanendert to win stage. Nice! #tdf
Frank back on. All still there. 1.3km to go.
2km and Schlecks cover it. #tdf Frank may have dropped
Basso with a litle acceleration. Gets off front. Voeckler bridges! Forces Cadel to attack #tdf
Gets flatter at the top. A sprint for seconds looks imminent between the big swingers. #tdf
Basso on tempo again. Sharing with Andy. #tdf
Vanendert has 40s and 3km. Sanchez bridging. Could get him. #tdf
Sanchez again. Slow response. ? No response. Andy on tempo #tdf
Sanchez goes SchleckF covers #tdf
Schlecks still looking dangerous with 4km to go. #tdf all together though
Basso riding a tough tempo #tdf
Vanendert is 30s up and may win stage for Belgium. All hitters together #tdf
5 to go. All hitters together #tdf
6 to go. Headed to next 10% bit. Fireworks to come! #tdf
Voeckler still there. 6.5 to go. Ludicrous! #tdf ride of his life!
Basso on the yoyo #tdf
Schlecks still looking at Alberto and both away #tdf
7 to go. 12 still in it. #tdf
Contador defensive for now. ?waiting for steep bit with 5 to go? #tdf
Frank now. Cadel on him. Andy resting at back. Will surely go again #tdf
Sanchez sneaking off front. Maybe slowing the Schleck accelerations #tdf
Voeckler & Cadel cover #tdf
9 to go. All together again Andy 3rd attack
Now Contador, 2 Schlecks, Cadel, Vanendert &... Voeckler?!?!? #tdf
No Alberto yet #tdf
Andy again! Cadel gets on #tdf
Again Voeckler is in touch with a teammate. Amazing ride in yellow #tdf
Cadel, Frank, Voeckler, Sanchez, Basso cover it #tdf
Andy and Alberto away #tdf
About 11 to go, hill flattens slightly, VDV still banging it out up front. This is wicked! #tdf
Again Basso looms. Contador not looking great to be honest. #tdf
VDV is back baby! Love watching Christian when he is on song! So cool. #tdf
Voeckler is pretty big @Ride_Argyle - VDV smoking!!! Go you good things!! #tdf
VDV putting TommyD up front. Interesting! Go little Tommy! #tdf
Down to 20ish with 13km to go. Almost over the steepest part. Jens finally blows! #tdf
Love seeing the lads slowly pinging off the back when the pain is being laid down. Jens smoking it up #tdf
Basso looming, Cadel looks good, Schlecks are on for it today! 14km to go. #tdf
Jens! About to give the road back his pain from 2 falls. #hardman #tdf
Hincapie superb for Cadel to pop him in perfect spot #tdf
Showtime! We're about to hit the final climb! Leopard belting it with 15km to go. All strung out. #TdF
Fabian has pulled over 90s out of a 17man break in under 8km! Good grief! #TdF
Fabs on the front. WOOWOO!! The pain train is coming! #TdF 30-odd km to go
Jens a 2nd crash! Looks seriously pissed. Road is in for it now. #hardman #TdF
Jens crashed over the side of road. He's fine. Not sure the road's ok... #hardman #TdF
Leopard have 2 men up the rd @brassyn - will have a lot of horsepower in front for the final climb #TdF
Shades of Saxomobank 08-09 & Postal of a decade ago with Leopard smashing the bunch with their domestiques. #TdF
Second Big Test #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-6X
The Champ Rolls On #TdF http://t.co/jyJyHNL
The Champ Rolls On http://wp.me/pSim5-6T
Get your CV out there @davecasey1 - always lookin for new staff. I'm working with an Aussie Rules team now. Blog still going too!
Incredible work Thor Hushovd. Great win. Moncoutie 2nd, Roy 3rd. Gives Gavlar the swanny a hug on the line. Job done! #TdF
So good to see the Rainbow Jersey on the front of the Tour! Brilliant! Curse? What curse? #TdF
Thor hits again and with 2km to go, will win the day! Chapeau. The man can honour the bands! #TdF
Thor makes a final push 3km out. He'll get on. Amazing riding! #TdF
Phwoar this is wicked!! Underdogs. You've gotta love 'em! Go Roy! Thor looks done. #TdF
Thor's gonna have to do it himself. Still reckon he's got it covered. #TdF
Moncoutie now refusing to help out methinks. Could Roy hold them off?? #TdF
@ajmpalmer you cracking the bubbly mate? Been a good year!
17s with 10km to go. Roy is going to be the valiant loser here. Can't see how Thor can lose from here #TdF
Garmin Swannies getting their podium bags ready for Thor's win I'd reckon. #TdF
Thor's only 31s down at 15km. Roy in trouble. Feel for him here - has ridden super well. That is bike racing. #TdF
20km and 66sec. That's 19s in 5km. Still in doubt, but looks promising. #TdF
@Garmin hey mate! Hating having to watch on tv! Not nearly enough sleep. Hope you're well. Get to Aus! We'll grab a beer!
Lot of chat between Thor & Moncoutie. I'll say it again... KahCHING!! #TdF
85s for Thor to find in 25km. Tough gig. Needs to Moncoutie to help out. KaCHING! #TdF
Thor's got Moncoutie! Now for Roy. Looks good for the big man in the bands! #TdF
Eek! That is a freaking scary looking descent. #TdF
Big Thor has 1km to get over the hill and 2min to take out of Jeremy Roy over 42km to then contest the finale. #TdF
Thor is barely staying in touch with the race leader Roy. Will descend like a demon to catch him and set up a stage win. #TdF
Thor, Roy & Moncoutie well up on peloton with 7km of climbing left, then descend-a-thon. Thor for another win? #TdF
Heh @Fake_Klier when you see how little leeway he gives the breaks, methinks Voeckler's stops are nervous wees #TdF
A Breather. Sort Of. #TdF http://t.co/OMWh80h
A Breather. Sort of. http://wp.me/pSim5-6Q
PS @1bigbikeracefan my blog entry today is http://t.co/t4Bkk99 #TdF
Hey @1bigbikeracefan my blog has stuff from July 2010 archive on caring for the riders tobbloggan.wordpress.com #TdF
More Questions #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-6M
@Velocentric the morality goes very grey as you know people and the background of their choices. Still not EVER right, but... Understandable
Answer THAT in 140 characters @Velocentric ?? In a word: no. If he was less open, or in denial, diff story, but he's neither. Is a good man.
@nicknorco @festinagirl @velocentric a pleasure. Now to bed. Work mañana will hurt! #tdf
@nicknorco @festinagirl most are clean now. I am v confident '09-10 Garmin boys are clean, and they compete at top level Ergo most are clean
@festinagirl "different dope? Still as dirty?" So that's why Voeckler stayed in touch tonight? That's an odd viewpoint to say the least
@festinagirl @nicknorco @velocentric I too was off Cadel til he won THAT strafe bianchi #Giro stage. True swingers
Wheel sucking? @charliegirl2008 If a dude's getting piped, he's on someone's wheel. Should they ride shoulder to shoulder?
@nicknorco @festinagirl I think it's more cat & mouse cos they're cleaner and it's a more level playing field
That's gold @festinagirl - and I don't massively follow Cadel. Just reckon he rides bikes good and stuff...
@Velocentric @nicknorco hahaha! True. Why don't Italians go well in the #tdf these days?
@festinagirl BMC are dodgy? UCI & WADA rated him a very low likelihood if I remember correctly #tdf
@festinagirl @velocentric hahaha! He was a damp squib pre-worlds win! But boy can ride these days! #tdf
@Velocentric so 2008 and earlier? Long memory! He won the best Grandy stage in years, a monument, defended his jersey amazingly at worlds...
Voeckler retains yellow. Frank leapfrogs Cadel. Contador in serious trouble for the race #TdF
Contador dropped!!! Oh my #tdf
Sammy Sanchez grabs it! #tdf
@Velocentric seriously?? When?
Cadel has flicked the elbow twice and Basso just sits #tdf
Contador hasn't responded!! Ok. So he has now... #tdf
Does Cadel not remember sastre beating him in 08??
Frank again #tdf
Who tipped the only teams to have 2 men left to be Leopard and... Europcar!?!? #tdf
Basso Contador Cadel and Schlecks. On skis. Not sure who looks best #tdf
Attack! Andy goes #tdf
Vanendert sporting one of the great used car salesman moustaches. #tdf
Contador to hit very very hard very soon... #TdF
Voeckler still there so it ain't that hard... I mean, it's ridiculously hard for normals... #tdf
Waiting for the next big move - 10km to go #tdf
Sammy Sanchez flying right now! Klodi gone. Worst race everrr for Shack. #tdf
And the final climb starts! Gaaaaame on! #TdF
Andy slipped his chain again!! Amateurrrrrr. #TdF #chaingatewhinger
Ok. So we have engine, stealth paint,  Berry avoidance, marketing tool & super light as options for #Schlecksblackbikes #TdF
Noo! VDV on the yoyo off the back of the bunch! Hold on mate! #TdF Jens is pumping it.
Schlecks riding black Treks compared to the rest of the team. Extra light? Engines? (hahaha) #TdF
46km out and it's on like Donkey Kong! #TdF
Leopard Trek up the ante!! Early! #TdF
Now It's Tourmalet time! Thomas gets back in touch with front break #TdF
it's carnage @rainesy29 - they've all got brown stains in their shorts right now #TdF
same spot @parsingphase - Voeckler, Kloden & Sammy Sanchez dropped it too #tdf
Must be oil on that 1st corner! Massive crash for peloton too. #TdF
How will Thomas cope with the Tourmalet descent?? Clearly shitscared. #TdF
Thomas lucky to be in race after a shocker of a corner! #TdF
Do yourselves a favour and get on Lick ice cream. Stuff's a-frickin-mazing. Especially you @MitchClark1 http://t.co/4rTbzLy
Big-Hitters' Playground #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-6J
@festinagirl true he was a pure defender, but his palmares since late '09 say Cadel's a new rider. Bringit! #TdF
Cadel to attack on Tourmalet descent & make Schlecks & Contador chase him up final hill. My #TdF dream!
you only lost Brajkovic @MI_Cycling_Fan ? I'm down Wiggo, Horner and probably Hoogerland soon!! Yeowch! #TdF
#Velogames #fantasy #TdF ranks: @blue_frog80 881st, @stakes14 6376th, @TQHopper 3646th & I'm 5819th anyone else?

Great to see Greipel get his 1st  #TdF win! Will be a close tussle for the green jersey: PhilGil v Cav

I feel a little weird with no Tour to watch! And my body clock has me wide awake now anyway! #TdF
@Matthew_J19 @Bondles I know! The pain! I think it's resolved now. Thanks for the heads up
oh crap. Thanks @Bondles I'll try and sort it out. Apologies people.
Bad Day Of Racing #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-6a
@imacsweb Tejay's gonna be a gun. Shutting it down for the night though! Haste mañana!
Thor is owning it @imacsweb - will get over this berg, and they'll pull it back, crashes notwithstanding #TdF
Break gaining time again. Garmin not pushing pace as Thor not smashing this hill! Need 3'20" or so still #tdf
with Thor, anything's possible @imacsweb but he is under duress as they need to chase so hard after crash #TdF
Thor a lot further back in bunch as they hit final cat 2 climb. May be in trouble #tdf
Wow. Up to 9 abandonments today. Nightmare! Reminds me of stage 2 last yr #TdF http://t.co/tBXWfrD
Perhaps Voeckler has bought JohnnyBreakaway's help in hopes of gaining yellow #TdF
Garmin driving hard to pull break in. Now need about 4'50" in 74km to protect yellow (6'10") to leaders #TdF
Garmin have 82km to find about 6min on Voeckler to keep the yellow jersey #TdF
if Voeckler trades climb pts to get JohnnyBreakaway riding for him to win the yellow he'd do well #TdF
Zabriskie out too. Bad head knock. He has had some bad ones previously. Hope he's alright. #TdF
Crash has pushed break's gap out to 6'40" - may lose Thor his jersey to Voeckler #tdf
Gilbert & Thor on front of peloton to let those in crash catch up. Vino & VDB2 out of #TdF
Crap. Jurgen VDB is out. Unbelievable attrition for the big hitters. #tdf
Just a terrible time waiting to see who's crashed & how bad they are #tdf
Zab also looks like he's in trouble. Doc looks like he's testing concussion. #tdf
This is messed up. Riders lifting their teammates out of the ditch?? Very bad news. Vino in a world of hurt #tdf
Crash! BMC & lotto and Klodi!! Shack can't buy a trick #tdf
Love watching JohnnyBreakaway fight for the climb jersey! Not a great climber, king of the mountains. Go figure. #tdf
Great Johnny Breakaway's away again! Voeckler, at 90" also there. 113km to go. Won't stick if Thor survives hills #TdF
Can He Hold? #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-65
Surprisingly Static #TdF http://wp.me/pSim5-5W
Costa 1, Gilbert 2, then bunch including Hushovd. Bloke is a freak! still in yellow. #tdf
Contador attacking like mad, not taking time though #tdf
Costa with 1 km to go! Hold on lad!! #tdf
Gesink & Hesje dropped on final climb #tdf
Costa solo 4km to go. Vino 20" down, Cadel & Thor 71" down. Vino in yellow at this moment #tdf
Vino coming hard! Flecha sitting pretty on Vino. #tdf
Final 6km and break may stick! 30" to Vino, 60" to bunch. Thor may hold yellow again!! #tdf
Lead 4 attacking each other. They're toast! Vino flying. 11.5km to go #tdf
Hesjedal ALWAYS rides such bad position in bunch! No wonder he lost time before mountains! #tdf
15km to go. 45" to Vino, 45" more to peloton. Van Garderen leads with 3 others. Great set-up for finale! #tdf
Gesink bit it a few days ago, still suffering @jwy80 #tdf
Gesink dropped on climb for some reason. BMC driving the bunch. Can Cadel drop the skinny lads on the descent? #tdf
Still no reaction from the peloton of note. 23km to go, one more climb. 2' gap. #tdf
Vino kicks! #tdf
Grupetto! Agh Robbie McEwen will be missed! #tdf
All hitters lined on front. Wiggo always said N attack 1st - you will be caught. Who will go?? #tdf
Ahh so good to see the pain of the hills start! #tdf
Great to see Ty Farrar and Jules Dean up helping out on a climb day #tdf ?Millartime tonight? Hope so!
50km to go 4'14" to break. Hit squads organising at the front. Fireworks tonight at the Tour!! Woohoo!! #tdf
@blue_frog80 @scottant77 I like Cadel for yellow tonight! http://t.co/HH0nPIO #TdF
Vino is a good chance @Nhughz - he has flagged holding yellow as a goal, so he's upskis for it #TdF
Time For The Hitters http://wp.me/pSim5-5S
Shocking run for Shack continues with Horner dealing with concussion. Only Klodi left intact! Bad times #tdf
Flicking out a shout to @charmo_19 the big emu has joined the 21st century.
Back online for Super Besse! Not hard enough for big hitters to do damage, but Contador will be aggressive #tdf
Confirmed, Levi has lost 65sec. Nightmare 2 days for R'Shack. Brajkovic out, Levi down. Not ideal #TdF
Leipheimer appears to have lost 62s. Thor just pipped by Gossy on the line. Great bike throw Gossy! #TdF
Eddie the Boss wins it! Thor & Gossy close for 2nd #TdF
Come on Millar! Drag VDB & Voeckler back in! 1.5km to go #TdF
Levi crashed at 5km! Bad luck for him. Slipped on white line on road. #TdF
Hushovd, Evans, Gilbert looming. HTC riders? Which one will go? 5km to go. #TdF
Malori of Lampre remains 30s up with 7km to go. A great ride, but the hill at the end will screw him #TdF
Also appears awful soon to have the break so close to being caught. ?further carnage awaits? #TdF
Also Gilbert, Thomas, Voeckler... Too early in #TdF to let a break go. Despite my blog http://t.co/a36IBQr
Lookin like a Thor vs Cav/Gossy shootout. They've pulled the break close very early. #TdF
Break or Bunchy? Not sure tonight... I think break. Hoogerland-Pineau-Iglinsky #TdF http://t.co/a36IBQr

Death Of The Curse http://wp.me/pSim5-5w
you were correct @Gabi_Marie - Thor was amazing, as was Cadel! Great stage. #tdf
Looks like Wiggo & Andy lost a couple of secs to Cadel & Contador. Hushovd? Freak!! #tdf Chapeau.
Thor retains yellow! Incredible ride. Cadel. Contador. Vino. #tdf
VDB off. Cadel looms. Gilbert? Thor coming again #tdf
Thor is still there!!! Amazing!! 1k to go!! #tdf
Contador goes early. #tdf
When will Gilbert go #tdf
Thor still in touch! #tdf
Big George takes a great turn! #tdf
Alrighty. 4km to go. All together. Ty off the back. #tdf
Having a nap pre-finale. Again, Gilbert-Hesje-Evans, Millar in yellow http://t.co/rzMzWAM #TdF
@Gabi_Marie Of course! Good point! I reckon Millar for yellow today. He climbs better'n Thor #tdf
AND @miketomalaris you'll note I only picked a Garmin boy for 2nd (& the yellow) #tdf
ha ha @Kimbo_Ramplin @miketomalaris Johnny H was in a break w/ #JackyBobby last yr: breakaway gun
Ty dominant in the intermed sprint! ?Thor not up for it this yr?? #tdf
Loving Hoogerland in the break! Points for my #tdf fantasy!
BOOM! @au_sesquip I was wondering who it was owning fantasy #tdf - anyone else on it let me know.
Gilbert Gilbert http://wp.me/pSim5-5t
Ok @MattRabin Gilbert-Hesjedal-Evans, with Millar for yellow. Boom. #TdF #HeardItHereFirst
Gilbert Gilbert @ClarkeyAC (that's a #dadjoke for Gilbert to repeat) #tdf
A Great Result http://t.co/2H6F96d #TdF
A Great Result http://wp.me/pSim5-5q
If I'm failing on velogames #TdF fantasy, SBS are failing on their game! No change in 2days. Sort it out @miketomalaris
On #TdF fantasy, I am failing epically on velgoames. @markz631 (among others) belting me
What news to wake up to!  Tyler you finally got it mate! Congrats to the whole team. Great! #TdF
I love Ty & the Tour, but a man's gotta sleep & it's a long race! Can't wait to see who won! GO TY!!! #tdf
Interesting to see Garmin domestiques are Ram! Zab, Millar, TommyD on the front #tdf
Looks like the perfect set up for Garmin today: 5man break, short leash, bunch kick finish. #tdf wp.me/pSim5-4X

Ahh The First Time! http://wp.me/pSim5-4R
If anyone else has ideas of what's in #Wiggosbox then let us know #TdF
What a great TTT! Garmin have the  #TdF stage win monkey off their backs. Ty will win 2 stages #heardithere1st
This #tdf is shaping up superbly - Contador has to take well over 60s out of Wiggo, Cadel, Schleck & Gesink. Ouch
Thor gets jersey by 1s!! Congrats Garmin!! #tdf
BMC drop 5s more. Thor's gonna hold yellow! Way to go Garmin boys! Chapeau #tdf
Wiggo has taken 24s out of Contador, Schlecks take 20 out of him!! Race is on!! #tdf
BMC 2 men down. Cadel may lose a little time on lead, but not his rivals. #tdf
Leopard +8s at 2nd check. Still a threat! Yikes. Nervous! #tdf
HTC for 3rd across the line. Garmin need to beat BMC by 3s for Thor to hold yellow. #tdf
BMC still in the race! 1s down on Garmin at 1st check. Oh my oh my. #tdf
#wiggosbox = jet pack, iPod (avec Who), motor, smartphone, ciggies, whiskey, Microphone..? #tdf
Shack boys take 18s out of Contador. #tdf
Can imagine Cadel losing his shit over the poorly fit of his green zootsuit! #tdf
So #wiggosbox - whiskey? Drumstix? Fags? Radio? Your thoughts? #tdf
Shack 9s off pace. I am about to call this for the Garmin train! #tdf
Congrats @robbyketchell - boys looked brilliant. Hopefully they'll hold off HTC et al! #tdf
HTC crash! Not a good start #tdf
HTC about to roll. Holy crap if they beat Garmin to 2nd aGAIN it'll be some kind of tragedy! #tdf
“@dmuheim: water bottle? #secretweapon #secretagent 111 in binary is 007.” that is awesome! #tdf
Garmin hold off Sky!!! #tdf
Sky down to 5ish... Gonna be so so close! #tdf
Shack are underway. Cue Emperor's March... Heh #tdf
Garmin back in front at 2nd check. Great racing! Wig go is immense! #tdf
cigarillos, HR monitor, drumsticks, radio? #wiggosbox #tdf
Off the imptnt thoughts on Wiggo's box, Cofidis dropped a bloke off the line!? Long day lad! #tdf
Wiggo and his mystery box has been known to drop teammates! #tdf  2009 for example...
Sky appear to be dropping 2 riders. What a race! #tdf
Sky 1s up at 1st check! Awesome racing!! #tdf
maybe his iPhone so he can tweet on the road? @pllb
Wonder what that side box thingy is under Wiggo's suit. Bit big to be a radio isn't it? #tdf
I love the sound of disc wheels! So cool. #tdf
Here we go. Sky under way. Wiggo v his old teammates! Bring it on!! #tdf
Love the French team mediocre-off in TTTs! I think Europcar are the least bad of them... #tdf
Now to wait for the Sky, HTC & Radioshack hitsquads. Ohhh the tension! #tdf
Garmin cross 12s up! Great ride #tdf
Come on boys! Slow down clock!! Slow dooown!! Hahaha! #tdf
Come on lads! Drive home. Gogogogogogo!!! #tdf
Garmin down to 6 #tdf
Leakygas crossing a fair way down. Basso 45s down on Gesink #tdf
Garmin well up at 1st check. And 2nd! Up 13s on Rabo for now. Wait for Sky though... #tdf
Thanks all! JD is our man down. Bring that train home lads!! #tdf
thanks @cyclingdiva JD would be the least bad loss! Defo wasn't Zab I saw his kit. #tdf
We're a man down. Wonder who? Bloody TV coverage! #tdf
Boys looking pretty good right now. Come on boys!! Boys being Garmin, btw... #tdf
Gesink takes 16 more seconds over Contador!! Boombah! #tdf
Rabo 1st through 2nd check too! Who am I kidding? Come on Garmin!! #tdf
Come on Garmin!! Rip it up lads!! #tdf
Rabo up on Saxo at 1st check. FDJ close to Saxo!! Oh dear. Bertie losing time today... #tdf
Danny can TT well @au_sesquip but he is was 1st man dropped repeatedly when I was at Garmin in '09 & 10
Ok. Take a deep breath. Show's over until the next hit squad come out to play #tdf
Saxo with final 5 #tdf  all on the line for Alberto
@stakes14 you and me both brother! Other than the LARS...
Saxomophoooooone down to 6 men. No margin for error! #tdf
yeah @stakes14 they ride heavier, more aerodynamic bikes for TTs. Also on different handlebars and gear/brake set-ups
Saxo already a man down. Bertie losing more time today? What a race it's shaping into! #tdf
Saxo looking ragged. Not ideal for Contador! #tdf
#TdF '09 @chrismurphy101 and Giro '09, '10... Can fold like a cheap suit under pressure...
And they're away!! Saxomobaaaaank. #tdf
Harsh to say, but DannyPate can choke in a TTT. Could be a liability for HTC today #tdf

@c_fiddy I think @LanterneToby would be appropriate! Am on velogames and cyclingcentral. You? #TdF
Velogames #tdf fantasy league I'm 2nd last! The shame! @TQHopper dominating to date. Early days!
Haha! Just checked fantasy #tdf scores... Bringing up the rear in both is yours truly! I know my bikes.

THREE WEEKS TO GO http://t.co/KY4X7nT #TdF
Horner to take the stage and the leader's jersey. Everyone else defending for their lives! Great ride from Hesje! #ATOC
Horner to take the stage and the leader's jersey. Everyone else defending for their lives! Great ride from Hesje! #ATOK
Horner smoked it up and gapped rest of field. Now TommyD and Hesje can team up. Will VDV get on too? #ATOC
Horner gapped Ryder & Levi. Pressure's on Hesje to chase it. Bummer!! #ATOC
Ryder vs Levi & Horner. Holy crap! Come on Hesje!! #ATOC
HAHA! #WeightOfANation indeed @Garmin - I reckon he can do it. GO HESJE!! #ATOC
Great to awaken to see Ryder lighting up Cali! Can hold on after big efforts that man! Go the big diesel. #ATOC
30km out, Le Mevel grp up 90s (ish) on peloton, and Contador is 79s up on LeMev. Bugger! Likely 2nd on gc for LeMev tonight! #Giro
Millar & @MuriloFischerMF saying to Contador "Please give him a day Bertie. I agree. It was bad steak. Please?" #Giro
Great to see Le Mevel up the road and fighting! Unlikely to be given much rope, but good he's out there! #Giro
Too funny @TdFLanterne ! Maybe he'll threaten to block riders who don't join Grupetto at il #Giro @forlodge1 @HopheadVelo
Hah! @forlodge1 @HopheadVelo @TdFLanterne Angriest man in the peloton could scare a grupetto together... #Giro
My tip is Matty Wilson or Robbie Hunter to be new capo di Grupetto @forlodge1  Thoughts @HopheadVelo @TdFLanterne ?
Robbie McE not calling grupetto and surfing the car convoy will hurt a lot of less experienced lads in il #Giro @forlodge1
Bugger RMcEwen & GBrown both got time cut Stg8, but if they battled on that stage, Wk 3 = impossible! #Giro
Contador wins it. Kreuziger, Nibali, Garzelli, Kvitsov in following bunch. #Giro
Nibali attacks the rest of the grp to gap the rest of the bunch #Giro
Contador kicks to get over the top of the climb to seal the stage. Impressive ride from the Spanish steak eater #Giro
Kreuziger finally has a crack to limit his losses with 2.5km to go #Giro
3km to go. Contador & Guillen (tiny Sth American climber) up by 58sec on the field. #Giro
Contador about 40" up on the other Big Hitters at the 5km mark #Giro
5km. Oddly the chasers aren't organised. Umm... it's Contador fellas! You gotta chase or the #Giro is done!
Contador goes again, and drops Scarponi too! Dominant performance #Giro
Still no sign of what Kreuziger and Nibali are doing. Not enough... #Giro
Scarponi responds. No Kreuziger or Nibali big response yet! #Giro
Contador attacks. #Giro
53" with 7km to go. Surely the lesser lights will have a dig for the stage win #Giro
80" with 8km to go. Looks tough for the break at #Giro
10km and 2min. The break looks like it might stick. Just! #Giro
Lead grp down to 3 with 12km to go & 2'25" lead at #Giro
Love that Contador's byline on the SBS coverage was "Spanish TT champ 2009!" He's won a few more than that! #Giro
Front grp mucking around with 15km to go at #Giro - will lose that 2'30" gap if they keep it up!
And they start the final climb! #Giro Enormous crowds!!
Great to see @MuriloFischerMF leading the Garmin lads up the peloton #Giro
I love watching il #Giro to see Italian teams blow their loads early! Lampre doing ALL of the work? Silly!
Remember today is Black Armband Saturday to honour Wouter Weylandt & Shamus Liptrot http://on.fb.me/jdL3Ji
Alright! Chase is on!! #Giro
Weird to see no Rabo & no Liquigas chasing. Garmin working to defend... 4th... Hmmm #Giro
Good to see McEwen surfing the cars like the wily old pro he is! #Giro
Surely Liquigas will start to chase! #Giro
Ok. Shake it off! Strong man stage. I'm on Pinotti 1, Millar 2, Pineau 3, Arroyo Duran 4, Lang 5. Thoughts?
Hard to get fired up for #Giro today.
RT: to all riders Black Armband Saturday to honor the passing of Wouter Weylandt &Shamus Liptrot http://on.fb.me/jdL3Ji
Impressive #Giro tip from @mattrabin re: D Millar in day's top 5! Congrats to Dave. Sad, sad news abt Weylandt.
My blind guesses (aka tips) for Stg3 #Giro 1Hondo 2 @murilofischerMF 3Pineau4Cav5Tyler Standard pts system Rayban?
@gpyman the official Gazetta feed is the easiest, with the glitch of being in Italian. Authentic #Giro watching!
Ok @mattrabin - who you got top 5 for today mate? #Giro Not sure if the sprinters will be there at the finish...
Tips for #Giro Stage 2 anybody? Bunch kick - Cav-Ty-Chicchi-Petacchi-Blythe you heard it hear 1st people!
The pain of the #Giro not being on live free to air TV in Aus! Can't stay awake for a stream on my crappy net connection
What a Spring Classic campaign! Belgium reigns supreme. Leopard Trek = season's bridesmaids #procycling
I think similar to Fabian being marked out of Roubaix, Gilbert will struggle at #LBL today @Norbert68
#LBL away! - smart money is on Gilbert, but I'm for Hesjedal to beat Gerrans! Heart on sleeve tipster!
I'm not sure about flying attack @andi8488 but #fleche means arrow as well. Great win for Gilbert again!
I WISH it was that VDB! @IlGruppocc But no, I mean the new VDB... #Fleche
21km, 34s.  Is this a radios in or out race? Doesn't seem to change the tactics much. #Fleche
Very true @Halfwheeling - was awesome to see Cadel blow Contador away last year with a well timed ride! #Fleche
Gilbert on the front. Does that mean VDB is up for it? ANOTHER Belgian win?? #Fleche
Love the Mur de Huy.  One of the great hills! #Fleche
Painful result for Dan @lendylen and I of course accept responsibility - clearly my fault for tipping him! #Fleche
Argh! @Cyclingnewsfeed reports that Dan Martin has just crashed out! (NOT abandoned!) #Fleche
Another Belgian to win #FlecheWallone today? I'm thinking... Dan Martin! Go the Brummie Irishman! #Fleche
Another Belgian to win #FlecheWallone today? I'm thinking... Dan Martin! Go the Brummie Irishman!
Awesome day - bring on Fleche! Belgians dominant this Spring. Can they keep the roll going?
Thanks to all who tweeted result! Feed shut down online! Shocking timing! #AGR #Amstel
Gilbert wins, Rodriguez (Purito to the Spainos) 2nd. Awesome finale. #AGR #Amstel
Aahhhh! My net is dying! Crap! What's happening?? #agr
Last climb. Group together. #AGR
Schleck could stay clear! Final few km #AGR
A Schleck away, Gilbert & co chasing. Where'd all those Rabo guys get to? #AGR
Loving the Spanish tweets about Purito Rodriguez attacking! Go J-Quan! #AGR
Garmin either hoping it comes back, or needing to work hard to shut this down! #AGR
Apparently it's disrespectful to race when Fabs or a Schleck crashes. Maybe Fabs should order another go slow. #AGR #TdF
What? Fabian and/or a Schleck crashed and everyone didn't wait? Shame on everyone else... not... #AGR
So disappointed that this week's bike racing won'y be on tv in Aus. #Ardennes
Hilarious - Ty Farrar could have both the current Roubaix and World Champions working for him at #TdF
I don't think Thor backed off @CTPCycling - he can now claim that, but he was riding to win 30km out. #ParisRoubaix
Chapeau to Summie & Fabs for riding like men. Ballan let himself down as a rider, a racer, and as a man. Thor...? #ParisRoubaix
Summie wins Roubaix AND successfuly proposes to his missus Jasmine? That's a good day. #ParisRoubaix
Great to see Summie on the top of the podium at Roubaix! So happy for him and the team. #ParisRoubaix
So excited I can't even see the keyboard anymore! Summie wins #ParisRoubaix ! Great result for a great bloke!
Surely he can't catch Summie!!! Oh my God. Please drive on Summie!!! #ParisRoubaix
Holy shitballs. Fabian has just shredded yards out of everyone with 3km to go. #ParisRoubaix
Johan Van Summeren! What a frickin legend! Winnnnnnerrrrrr!!!! #ParisRoubaix
Summie has 33sec!! 5.5km to go!!!! YOU BLOODY BEAUTY!!! He's going to win it! #ParisRoubaix
A Belgian vs a Dutchman. This is massive! #ParisRoubaix
This is the longest 10km I have ever watched! Come on Summie!!!!!!! #ParisRoubaix
Summie needs to tough it out. Come on mate. Hold hold hold! #ParisRoubaix
I think Fabs is at 50sec chasing Summie at 12km to go. COME ON MATE!! #ParisRoubaix
Fabian has gone bananas chasing with 14km to go. Absolutely flying. Nooooooooo! #ParisRoubaix
Johan van Summeren is going for it! 14km to go. And he is upby a few hundred metres! GO SUMMIE! #ParisRoubaix
Come on Summie!!!! GO BOY! #ParisRoubaix
Van Summeren, Bak, Rasch away off the front. 19km to go. Come on Summie! #ParisRoubaix
Summie is such a grinder! Has to get away from, the break boys. #ParisRoubaix
Back out to 70sec with 25km to go. Hushovd & Ballan have let themselves down. #ParisRoubaix
If you're gunna win, you've gotta earn it! Surely what Fabs just said to the two sitter innerers. #ParisRoubaix
Thor and Ballan are not covering themselves in glory right now. #ParisRoubaix
Fabian sits up. Thor and Ballan have been sitting in for waaaay too long. Fair enough I reckon. #ParisRoubaix
Fabian, Thor & Ballan dragging it up to the breakaway. Down to 25sec gap. 32km to go. #ParisRoubaix
Go Summie! Picks the right bloke to follow! Awesome. #ParisRoubaix
Clearly Fabs will catch them. Holy crap he's good! #ParisRoubaix
Fabs & Thor shredding it! Will they catch the break at 80sec?? #ParisRoubaix
?Dilemma for Garmin - chasing a bunch with van Summeren in it. Plenty of power there. #ParisRoubaix
Oh my! Fabs has dropped Flecha and Ballan on the flat road! Amazing. #ParisRoubaix
Thor's still covering Fabs! Go Hushovd! #ParisRoubaix
Fabs dropping the hammer. Unbelievable! #ParisRoubaix
Thor attacks!  Ty covering Fabs. Great racing! #ParisRoubaix
Summie at the front again coming into Pave. Awesome riding. #ParisRoubaix
Will Ty sacrifice for Thor? I reckon he will! Thor will look after Ty at #TDF if Ty looks after him at #ParisRoubaix
Four? Five Garmin boys in front? Go lads! #ParisRoubaix
van Summeren looking good right now! Go Summie! #ParisRoubaix
Boonen holding knee - was that the one he had operated on?  Nightmare! #ParisRoubaix
Boonen down AGAIN!! Bike screwed a second time! #ParisRoubaix
@Ride_Argyle @mattrabin I was SURE you were a chiro Raybannicus!! I know you would LIKE to be a physio...  hahaha.
Boonen AND Chavanel having mechanicals!  OUCH for Quickstep! #ParisRoubaix
Hahaha @mattrabin mate I am missing the show unbelievably!  Enjoy the day mate.  They've just gone through Arenberg.
Hahaha @MikePovey1 - I love a man who gives thanks for painful advice! Mind the road.
Psoas release: Response to @MikePovey1 http://wp.me/pPmF7-z
Alrighty. What a race! Bring on Roubaix. Reckon @Vaughters made the right call, just was unlucky it was made on air.
Great to see Maaskant's gf Lynne (sp?) the brunette podium girl! #RvV
Hah @vickiewoodsford - I was alluding to Fabs' & Federer's propensity to tears upon losing! It is only sport after all!
Is Fabian crying? What is it with Swiss sportsmen and crybaby Sue antics? #RvV #HTFU
Haha @GobCarlqvist noted Fabs sprinted on the hoods!! Love the trainspotting tragic nature of that! GOLD! #RvV
Great race!  Magnificent stuff! Nuyens with a great final push. #RvV
NGUYENS??????? Amazing result. Great ride Fabian and Chavanel! Great win Saxo! #RvV
Hahah! Oh the irony! #RvV
Chav MUST take a turn! Surely now he will take a turn.  Looks like he won't.  That's pretty crap. #RvV
Is Tomeke suddenly the tactical genius who made Fabs blow his load 30km too soon? #RvV
Captain courageous (aka @Vaughters ) is TWEETING?? Really?  Good grief.
6 man bunch kick coming right up!!  Who is it going to be? #RvV
Did I hear boos for Fabian at the top of the final berg??  Not cool Belgies!! #RvV
Gilbert!!!! #RvV
Still no Garmin lads in the front two groups...  are they sprinting for 14th?? #RvV
Now they must take turns for Fabian, or he must just sit up #RvV
Fabs finds a second effort!!! #RvV
Here come the cavalry!!! #RvV
Hahaha @Culbert_Report I think courageous decisions stopped in January for those guys!!
Chavanel has had a long time on the wheel.  Surely he'll get up this next berg too!?! #RvV
Was the Tomeke attack genius in making Fabs go too soon, or madness in putting himself out of the race? #RvV
Oh my.  JV tells Tyler and Thor to not chase.  #RvV
CJ Sutton wins KBK! 2nd time in my life I've been happy about a Sky victory!! Chapeau CeeJ
sadly i'm not over there @sullbeck - just watching from afar and getting very excited! Love the Classics!
Alright!  The good stuff starts.... NOW! Start of the Classics season this weekend. Good times are a-comin!
tomeke & fabs are P-R faves, Thor & Heiny front of 2nd tier faves esp w/ team they have! HH more for Flanders.
Heiny takes another stage at Qatar. Awesome riding! He's looking good coming to Spring Classics!
Haussler has 2 issues - no fancy stripey jersey & wrong colour p'port. Will need to rip it to lead at Garmin! Thor & Ty to lead
heh @NickDavi the Man in the Bands will be one of the leaders! Surely! And is good for PR. MsR? Farrar & Heinie quicker riders
nice! Heinrich Haussler takes stage of Qatar today. Who will be Garmin leader in classics?? Ty & Heinie both on a win!
#JACKYBOBBY BREAKS CHRIS BOARDMAN'S 15yr old 4km INDIV PURSUIT WORLD RECORD!! 4:10! Amazing work Jacko! Chapeau.
Interesting update regarding the MWhite sacking on cyclingnews.com - check it out!
Great job this week @cammeyercyclist - pity about the other crap. Fun season ahead for you now! Gulp.
Hey @JulietMacur and @Bonnie_D_Ford and @miketomalaris I'd love to get in touch with you guys about today's events. Drop me a DM! Tobes
Well @Culbert_Report I can't say I know why. I can say I'm not at all happy about it.
Great win Swifty, great win Cammy.  Happy days for the Garmin boys. Good stuff #TDU
WOOHOO!  Happiest I've ever been for a @TeamSky win!!  Swifty-Hendy 1st & 2nd. Gossy 3rd.  Cam holds onto the leader's jersey! BOOYAH! #TDU
Last lap!  Come on boys! Farrar-Greipel one two would suit me just fine!! #TDU
A dream for me would be JackyBobby and Cammy doing a mini TP for that final 1km-2km @CTPCycling I WISH! #TDU
Cam Meyer contesting a bunch sprint @CTPCycling ??? Hahahaha. Unlikely! #TDU
Break at 18" with JackyBobby in it. No way they'll stay away, so hopefully Tyler & Greipel can fight out a win! #TDU
so now gossy can be 1 or 2 to take overall. Bling 1st today for overall win! Go Ty & Greipel!! #tdu
not sure what Rabo did on sprint 2... Have lessened Bling's chances overall. Come on Tyler! Win for Cam #tdu
JD & Ty will go for bonuses if HTC prevent a break from forming, @CM_101 Best case is a break gobbling the pts
Equation for #TDU finale 2moro: Goss wins stage, Meyer loses race. Elsewise, Cam wins. Unless Gossy takes int. bonuses!
Thanks @CarloVerzeletti - Cam in lead still and hopefully can hold on for one more day! #TDU
i think it looks good for Cam to retain the lead... I think! Go Cammy! #TDU
fingers crossed for JackyBobby! We'll fimd out how he is soon enough! #TDU
go cammy! Stick with lad! #TDU
go Cammy! Get up that hill mate! Defend!!! Defeeeeeend!! #TDU
Bizarre seeing Ty & Cav do some grunt work on the front. Cammy still looking good! Go the Aussie legend! #TDU
massive day for Cam Meyer & the Garmin boys on the Queen Stage at #TDU hold that lead lads
BOOyah! Cam Meyer wins Stage4 #TDU - great ride Cam & Matty Wilson! Aus TT champ, now ProTour stage win! Boombah
Stage4 #TDU will be a sprint (for a change)! Passes thru Hahndorf, home of Garmin DS Matt White's only 2 groupies!! Haha
Amazing win for Bling Matthews today. Biggest names in sprinting behind you today. Bravissimo! #TDU
The Big Fella, Greipel obviously fancies himself here today. Got his boys working hard #TDU
No surprises it's looking all bunched up today at #tdu.  At least it's a safer finishing run! Go Farrar! haha
stirling stage of #tdu today. Tough-ish finish. Hard man bunchy... Gossy? Bugger it! I'll go for Ty again!
Sprint-a-rama 2011 (aka TDU) on the way.  For today's bunchie, my head says Greipel, heart: Farrar! #TDU
stage 1 of the jnr length Pro Tour race the #tdu (sprinters paradise) underway in 12hrs. Cav vs Greip vs Ty... Go TY! Biased? Moi?
talk about a let down on the crit yesterday! Better sprint field than TdF kicks off 2moro on the softest ProTour race of the year #TDU

The ex pro who'll tear off my legs 2moro is Matt White, @XylonVE - unsure if legs, lungs or ego will be worse!
Going for 3rd ever ride 2moro, 1st with a former pro.  It could be ugly.  Could be... who am I kidding? Out of my depth!
Txema was a truly lovely man. I am still struggling to believe it's true.
Terrible news that Txema Gonzalez, Sky soigneur has passed away. My thoughts are with his friends & family. Terrible.
4 sprints, 4 different winners. Good bike racing! #vuelta
Talking the boss through the final 5km on the phone as he is in transit! Always nervous when Ty's on a bunchy! Go lads. #vuelta

Regarding today's crash, our boys all ok. @MuriloFischerMF lost some skin, but it was so wet, they all just slid out! Good (ish) news.
Race shot to bits by a biblical deluge that hit in the final 5km. Crash final km, no sprint, just survival. Unlucky! #GiroVeneto

A traffic jam at 1am???  In Bordeaux SLOWLY headed to San Sebastian this weekend. Should be a good race! #WeightofaNation in good form.
@Kinnachan it was a great night! We're eating sea bass (sans laser beams on head) by a canal in Amsterdamage. A good post Tour chillout.

Re: sweat/wounds @JBarnesy I reckon it's a combo. We have finite energy: use energy til you sweat = less energy for healing. Theory only!
Urgh. Dud looking day right now! Hopefully it dries out by race time. #tdf
Hi @39teeth : heat's worse. Sweat in wounds, bodies more stressed (so slower healing) and there's more blood to skin, so more swelling.
Alright. Work rate slowing down! Finally!
Hahahaha! @CTPCycling - I'm the Physio, not the DS! I'll find out when you do!
30km to go. Excitement time! Sharp left 4km out could be trouble. 90deg right 700m out could be worse! Go Garmin-Transitions!
Thanks for the shouts @charliegirl2008 @lisafw @ride559 @mjhasgreeneyes.   Looks like another cracking day for a bunchie! Go boys.

9 roundabouts in final 5km. Yikes!
Hey @YoMarques . The boys are looking to continue where they left off yesterday & Ty's on the improve. In all, happy days!
Cracking day in Reims! Looking like a good day for racing.
The Bounce!: http://wp.me/pSim5-1a
Toughest man of day? Tyler with a broken hand, or Millar with broken rib? Let's call it an honourable hardman draw! Chapeau.
Great ride Hesje! Pure class. Proud of you lad.
All boys safely through final sector. You beauty! Go Hesje!
Sector 5 & 6 long, but not too bad. Sector 7 more a dirt road with occasional stones than a true sector. Going to be a filthy tough day!
4th sector. Proper cobbles. Ouch!
2nd sector. Longer, uphill. Still not too bad! 3rd sector not REALLY pavé.  http://myloc.me/8SS5R
Just crossed 1st sector. Very short and mild by the standards of this area.
Ryder "weight of a nation" Hesje in the break and virtual race leader! Alriiiiight.
Robbie & Zab on the line. Safe day boys! http://tweetphoto.com/31113935
Ty definitely starting today. Very tender campaigner, but a tough man. Respect!
Perfect Storm of Crap: http://wp.me/pSim5-19
So. VDV out. Ty lining up. Millar and Julian sore but starting. Good grief!
Holy crap what a long day! Can only get better!
Thanks for the support from all. Diagnoses and prognoses coming in and, whilst bad, it's not ALL bad. Specifics soon. V busy right now!
VDV, Ty, Jules in hospital for examination. Good grief!
We have 3 in hosp for checks re breaks. One on bus with ?rib. And more sorry boys unbroken but sore. Official news soon.
Cluster bomb has hit the team. As bad as you can think. Damn damn damn!
Damn.
At the finish. Grey skies, but currently dry. Ugly weather today.

Hilarious watching @dZabriskie try to get hotel cleaners to convert to natural products! Fine sentiment, but pushing it uphill methinks.

@Andrew303 Thanks mate, looking forward to having a beer with you at the #TDF after party. N.E.R.D are playing!
@JakesJournal Thanks Jake. Very excited about this twitter thing!
@YoMarques Well yes, sort of. I was going to use a team member as a prop for some stretching videos. Who would you like me to punish?
@SkinnyTyres thank you @39teet thanks for the shout out!
@timVcarls the stones have to seen to be believed. I've tried to describe them here http://bit.ly/9bCHE0 but don't think I did them justice
inspired by @gematkins I'll upload some videos with exercises for cyclists. Do you have a fav cyclist from the team you'd like in the vids?
@gematkinson Hi Gem, Sciatic issues are very common for cyclists. I'll upload some videos with streches/exercises and send you the link
