Help stop this horrible person, Joseph Kony, #KONY2012
Enjoying some awesome Santa Rosa training with my new team Bissell Pro Cycling! It's going to be a good year.
Can't even begin to tell you how happy I am to be engaged to the love of my life, Christina. Life is perfect.
Giro's over for me. I'd really like to do that race again when I've been training! Positive side is I get to go home for a bit :)
Good job Martin Kohler! He rode solo like a boss and took the mountain's jersey today at the Giro!
Couldn't have been a more beautiful ride to honor the memory of a fellow cyclist.
My heart goes out to Wouter Weylandt's family and friends. RIP
A little sore after yesterday's crash, but I'm ready for more Giro!
Happy Mother's Day Mom!
Torino Team Time Trial Today! http://twitpic.com/4uh53g
Nothing like finding out you're doing the Giro di Italia 4 days before it starts!
Had a great interview with @testrider for the new magazine Peloton. Got a copy of the latest issue, and the articles are awesome!
Please help my girlfriend's family: donate to "Jason Steven Respo memorial fund" at Rabobank. Her uncle tragically died Wed. Anything helps.
Dr. Eric Heiden took screws out of my femur today. He is a phenomenal surgeon! I'm already walking!  http://twitpic.com/2mwebp

This flight home is bitter-sweet. It sucks to end my season with only 20 race days, but I'm always happy to see my family and my girl :)
If you are bread, pigeons are piranhas that can fly.
My girl just left Florence headed for home :( but I'll be following her shortly :)
@taylorphinney yep I'm in Lucca. Are you here too?
Nice Job @tvangarderen88 Vuelta Podium!
@alex_howes go Team America!
@alex_howes Yeah, but I think the panDERPs were left behind. Plus they are easier to hunt.
@alex_howes can we make blow-darts and hunt pandas?
Heading back to Lucca for some more time off the bike. My body just doesn't want to do work right now.

Tour de L'Ain is over for me, but Morabito won today, although he was unfairly relegated to 2nd.
After spending yesterday in the breakaway, I'm ready for today's FLAT stage at Tour de L'Ain.
Feels like I keep starting my season over.
On my way to Tour de L'Ain prologue this evening. I start about 6pm.
Back on the bike today and it feels good.
@ericbennett feeling better now, hope all is well in CO
@ChristinaBoi love you too
Good luck to the guys starting Tour of Poland today!
More blood tests to make sure this isn't a mono relapse.
@ChristinaBoi thanks babe.
Well, I got last place yesterday and didn't start today because I'm sick. Oh well...
The woman ahead of me in the airport check-in line just changed her baby's diaper. Whaaa...?
On the road again. It's train, train, shuttle, air plane, van and I'll be in Wallonie.

Tour of Austria is over. Felt good today. Did 122km in 2hr 30min and got 15th today. Florian ended up 23rd overall and Butler 29th. Niiice.
So, I ended up 26th in the time trial today.
These storks are right outside our hotel window! http://twitpic.com/243qxz
Ricco crashed into a motorcycle in the TT today. Karma is a bitch.
Today's 231km stage was pretty uneventful. Boring 'til things got crazy in the last 20km. Helped Simon sprint for 10th! Very niiice.
@brentbookwalter you mis-spelled winner
@brentbookwalter Oh yeah, well we had 231km + a 9km neutral. Beat that!
I am lucky to have an amazing and supportive girlfriend. Love you Christina.
Florian took off like a rocket on the uphill finish for 12th today! I got 25th. I think my fitness is coming around...
Zahner was really excited about the view! http://twitpic.com/2379bg
We finished somewhere up there today. Brrr! Florian and @cbutler88 rode like mountain goats today! http://twitpic.com/237964
@thachad I know where your legs are... they're at 2,300 meters tomorrow! Think of it as the Austrian Gila Monster.
It was a rainy day today, but it's ok because we were underground most of the time ;) Austria has as many tunnels as mountains!
It's raining:D Hope the guys at the TDF have better weather today than we do at the Tour of Austria. http://twitpic.com/22vqi9
The final climb today had a section that was 22.3 percent! It hurt.
Austria has big mountains. http://twitpic.com/22lut6
Celebrated the 4th by finishing in the field on stage 1 Tour of Austria. Today's finish: a climb with the last 9km over 10 percent!
Riding in the team bus to Tour of Austria while my girlfriend and sister hold down the fort in Lucca. Race starts on the 4th of July.
Training in Lucca, Italy getting ready for Tour of Austria, which starts July 4th.
Tour of Beauce is over. It rained sooo hard today. Jackson Stewart 2nd. I felt good and am heading to Italy with some new-found confidence.
I'm now at Tour de Beauce and hangin' there. 2 stages down. It's great to be back racing!
Philly was my first race with the team since mono. I made the break, but got tired after 4 hours and dropped out. Major shock to the system!
Ok, so I know I suck at twitter, but now that I'm racing again I'm going to try my best to keep it updated. Here goes...
Off to the races with my mom, dad, and my girlriend finally! I'm starting things off with De Vlees Huis Ronde in Bakersfield.
So my spleen is enlarged but not too much. I should be back racing in 4 or 5 weeks.
Just got a ct scan to see if my spleen is ok. Should know by tomorrow.
@Sevenpelicans oh Ill be back at it before you know it.
Well I officially have Mono, so I won't be heading to Belgium any time soon.
Just dropped off my teammate Alexander Kristoff at LAX. He's off to Tour of Quatar, and is going to win a stage for BMC ;)
Why doesn't Bear Grylles just go AROUND the waterfall???
Morro Bay to Santa Barbara today was great! First ride sans rain! Now we finish up our camp in Agoura Hills. Maybe ride thru Ojai???
The ride from SF to SC (Cali Stage 3) was awesome! On another note, waking up early for UCI doping control is not.
4hrs in the rain today and I'm ready for 5 tomorrow! Woo!
Ride 1 of training camp down. Bikes look and feel fast! Now its off to do some medical testing for the UCI
Just had a collision with a toy helicopter at LAX

@louderjeff Best Mex food in camarillo is El Tecolote and I thought it meant "The Owl," but now I know it means "The Drunk."

MS charity ride tomorrow 8:30am at Seaside Park Ventura.
65 miles of Los Padres trails today! Didn't see a single person. I love mountainbiking.

According to airport security, my shins are made of metal.

Great final stage of L'avenir. I was off the front all day in both breaks and got 3rd. Tejay Vangarderen finished 2nd overall!
Stage 8 of L'avenir: Slept like a champ all morning, but its time to get my time trial onnnnnnnnnnnn
Wow that was hard. Who's idea was it to start on a climb and have a field sprint after a sketchy descent???
Hangin out in some French mountains tonight. Teejay is in 3rd after a hard climber's stage! I survived around 5min down. 6 down, 3 to go.
The long stages of l'Avenir are done. Pete Stetina got 2nd with a breakaway and I ended up 8th on the stage.
Stage 2 of l'avenir was faaaaast! Around 48km per hour average! I spent a lot of time on the front chasing the break and am feeling WORKED.
Stage 1 of l'avenir done. Wow that was sketchy! Nearly missed a couple crashes and ended up 15th.
Back in France. Rode through a French wind farm. Im ready for Tour d'Lavenir to start!
First rainy ride today after 6 whole days in Blgium! Not bad I'll take 1 in 6 any day ;)
If I pull my legwarmers up to my ass and wear my armwarmers on my calves, does that count as compression socks? Yes.
Got 6th in the tt this morning. Afternoon stage not so much...
@Sevenpelicans president avec sel! you know, the good stuff. and yeh i am stoked to do l'avenir again!
French racers are a bunch of friggin aliens... or I'm just super travel-weary. Hope I can punk some aliens in the tt tomorrow morning!
@brentbookwalter how do I join the happy leg cause?
@AustinCarroll no, silly. we're in France. Sheesh.
Coffee, stale bread, and butter for breakfast: can you guess where I am?
27 hours of travel, 5hours sleep in Izegem, 6hour van ride, then race tomorrow and Sunday in France. The Capri Tour.
Missing my girl already... And thinking LAX needs to just give up and start over. Jeeez...
back in california for a few days now. time to hit the reset button.
Got 3rd in the crit. Team rode awesome!
THAT was hard. 3 big climbs and a gnarly mountain finish. I was about 18min down. Louder held on to his podium spot.
Ian ended up 2nd and Brent 3rd yesterday. Time to do some damage today. 100miles and nearly 14,000 feet of climbing should shake things up!
That was frudtrating. My time got bumped down from 17.15 to 17.38? Chad flatted. We'll see how everyone else ends up.
Yeaaa this is my story, got my spacelegs onnnnn.
Survived stage 2. Man that was a long climb. Jeff rode like a manimal to 3rd place.
Worked hard for the team today and cruised up the final climb. Rock Racing took the lead today, but tomorrow is very selective: 30km climb.
Scored the young riders jersey. Brent won. Ian 3rd. Jeff just ahead of me. We STACKED the top 10!
Tour of Utah prologue was short and FAST! Waiting to see if anyone pushes me out of 4th place. Ian is in 2nd and Brent in 1st.
WHOA its hailing up in Alta this morning. Birthday wishes to @thachad today.
About to climb Mt. Nebo, UT in memory of my buddy Chance's dog. RIP Nebo, you were a classy pup.
