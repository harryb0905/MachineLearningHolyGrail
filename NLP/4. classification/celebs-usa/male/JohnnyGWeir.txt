If you look closely at the center of the blade it touches the ice first, then she hits the toe. I probably would have given it to her but it’s very close. Landing on the blade’s center means you’re landing flat footed &amp; is an easy way to hide an under rotation. Still, incredible. https://t.co/YDuaBe996G

Many of you got upset last night when I tried to finish that thought in one tweet so I thought it needed clarification. I’ve got a busy day ahead so excuse me while I lotion...
I was extremely lucky to grow up in a family/community of acceptance and perhaps that’s why I don’t see my sexuality as something that needs addressing. I am forever indebted however, to the warriors who came before me that allow me to lead the life I do so openly.
I wear my sexuality the same as I wear my sex or my skin color. It is something that simply is and something I was born into. I never “came out” in sport because I didn’t imagine it as a great secret &amp; it had nothing to do with my skating or my dreams.
Because of the attention on those athletes, many of you have written or tweeted because I am not referred to as “out” at either of my Olympics and in the traditional sense I wasn’t.
I am so thrilled that there are out representatives of the LGBTQ community competing at the Olympic Games. Notably, @guskenworthy ⛷ &amp; @Adaripp ⛸ among others. It is very brave for all of us to live our truths whether on the global stage or in our own homes.

Well, if 5 suitcases for the next ten days is any indication of what my Olympic wardrobe is going to be, I’d better grow some extra arms for hauling.
So excited to head to Nationals tomorrow and bring you guys coverage of the main events! The Olympic team will be decided in San Jose so cross your fingers for your favorites! ⛸
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!! Health, happiness and unbridled glamour to everyone!!! ❤️💫

Every time I get an email from @NBCOlympics about our travel or work itinerary at @pyeongchang2018, I am awed by how big a job it is to organize the thousands of NBC employees during the Games. Thank you to the entire team for your excellence. 💫

Not that that judging system didn’t need some fixing, however I wish figure skating could be the aspirational dreamy sport it once was where perfection was champion and not as much a mathematics competition as it has become. Nevertheless, the cream always rises to the top.
Having grown up in one judging system &amp; then adapting to the current one &amp; now watching @olympicchannel throwback coverage of 2002 Olympics, I am so nostalgic for the old ways. There was time in the programs to be unique, to create moments, to breathe &amp; emote, stunning. ❤️⛸
Starting tonight at 7pm, @olympicchannel is giving us a week of nostalgia. The free skates from the last 4 Winter Olympics (2002, 2006, 2010 &amp; 2014) will be featured. Tonight, the 2002 pairs and men. 2002 gave us the pairs double gold medal and the men, Yagudin vs. Plushenko! ⛸

I pay little attention to theatrical writers like P. Lukas who in a recent article tried to deligitimize ⛸ but I have to say,  sitting behind a computer screen gives you no license to discredit an Olympic sport (since 1908) simply because we wear costumes. #liveinourshoes #stfu
