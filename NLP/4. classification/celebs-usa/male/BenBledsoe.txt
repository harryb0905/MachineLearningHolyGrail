I've been #catfished several times in the past.  Luckily I've learned my lesson and now don't talk to anyone for any reason ever.  #catfish
You're probably being #catfished if someone keeps telling you that they're really successful in their industry but there's no way to check.
You know you're being #catfished when someone keeps telling you they they're a super celebrity but you can't find anything online about them
You know you're being #catfished when you find a receipt proving that all of this person's "friends" are hired actors from a local agency.
@Antinoth - Yep.  It's definitely an odd situation.  Especially the moment that you realize someone's #catfishing you. You just want to bail
Say what you want...  I'm a sucker for #catfish - even though I've had it happen to me many times (non-relationship), I'm always blown away.

Good morning, tweeterville.  I finally fell asleep at 4:45 by combining a few of your ideas.  You Rock! If you have more, tweet 'em on over.
@x_chiquita_x Thanks for the advice. I'll try it now. If you don't hear from me in 30 minutes, It means I'm asleep & you should write a book
It's 3:28 in the morning....  I've been in bed for hours and just can't fall asleep!  Any ideas?

If anyone you know needs an awesome Voice-Over demo for a great price, let me know.
Just gave IKEA one more chance & I'm even more convinced that there is not one intelligent thing about the way this Swedish rat trap is run.
@Rachel_OTRC you look Amazing on @OnTheRedCarpet.  Congrats on such an awesome gig!  You have an avid viewer from this point on.
I just had a craving for some Cat Stevens.  Apparently that happens.
Apparently my breaking point of anxiety and insanity lie within the tortured aisles of IKEA.  My first experience will also be my last.
