Floyd is punching hard with the one punch. Manny has to keep jabbing. #MayPac
Way to pick up the pace. #MayPac
When Manny is not jabbing that's when he is losing the fight. #MayPac
Floyd dictating fight right now. Manny can't stay in center of ring. He's got to jab. #MayPac

@gmai_hill taped earlier
@blackwidowLj thank you my friend
My low self esteem takes over the wheel fueled by my megalomaniac ego. Explosive combination. #UndisputedTruth
@PinupPickem @HBO doing Mitch was my favorite part to do.
@JoeMimic thank you. It's a big read 550 pages
@ProJones22 appreciated
@mnaz1986 I don't focus on the negative.
Losing to Buster Douglas... Bad day at the office.
@Jameson17 thank you for your service
@ritakh20 all in fun
For those of you asking, I am live tweeting my show airing on HBO right now called #UndisputedTruth.
My imitation of Mitch Green would not have been as authentic without the wig. #UndisputedTruth
See Mitch (Green) you forced me to put a sign on your eye that says closed for the season.
One of the words my vocal coach and I worked on was "epiphany".
@SpikeLee knew me over 20yrs and never told me he couldn't understand me. He got me a vocal coach for this show.
@JustinePeacock thank you. I enjoyed doing it.
I had a focus and drive like no other. I was going to be a God of War like Cus said. #UndisputedTruth
@micfiend06 much appreciated
@janddsdad611 it wasn't meant to be. I had this path for a reason.
@Wale_GOONER Spofford then Tryon Upstate.
@GoCosmicNinja thank you for the support. Appreciate it.
Like Cus said you have to face your demons because they will follow you to eternity.
@William____H yeah it's the worst part of the bathroom.
@MikeCHMiller it's crazy. Going back seems like my childhood didn't exist the way I said it did.  It looks so much better now.
@WARNERPROMOTION @HBO thank you
@Bakery_DuBois @HBO thank you my friend.
Cus told me if I listened to him and follow jus map to success, I would become the youngest heavyweight of all time.
The name Cus D'Amato will forever be synonymous with one another.
My first fight was with Gary the Bully.  He ripped my pigeons head off and threw the blood on me. I beat his a** it was love at first fight.
By the time I was 12 I had already been locked up over 38x's. Juvenile detention center was like Cheers... There everyone knew my name.
Since we had nothing we took pride in looking good. Our clothes played a big role in our identity and self esteem. #UndisputedTruth
Leaving Bed Stuy and moving to Brownsville back in the early 80's was like moving from the devils bathroom to his toilet. #UndisputedTruth
I grew up on 178 Amboy Street. It looks so different now.

#BeingMikeTyson was good for me that it made me have a reason to push myself to return.

Cus told me if I listened to him &amp; follow his map for success I would become the youngest heavyweight champion. http://t.co/57rxCCXFqT
Bobby Stewart punched me in my stomach and I felt the life leaving me. I never felt that kind of pain.#BeingMikeTyson http://t.co/mXdcXPpnNs

Talking to my son Amir.  He just turned 16.  Really smart young man.  Very proud father. #BeingMikeTyson

@lllaurenzo @MrDoodyHead Thank you my friend.
@RaffaMiami @JimBrownNFL32 I visited with him at his home in LA. #BeingMikeTyson
It's hard watching that scene about Exodus. She was only 4 years old when she died.  Milan was 5 months at the time. #BeingMikeTyson
Milan just asked me about Exodus.  My daughter that passed away.  Milan talks about her a lot.  Milan never met her.  #BeingMikeTyson
I can't even get her helmet on right.  #BeingMikeTyson
Teaching Milan how to ride her bike.  Gotta take her on her bike tomorrow. #BeingMikeTyson
My dad said to me the only thing he could teach me was about the bible and pimping.  He was a preacher/pimp. #BeingMikeTyson
Visiting the home of legendary @JimBrownNFL32.  Great man.  He still looks good.  Has an athletic build still.
That's my little girl Milan 4 years old.  That just said she loved me. #BeingMikeTyson

#BeingMikeTyson the kid that Evan's fought told us before the fight that me nor @holyfield could save Evan's that night.
#BeingMikeTyson watching Evan's in the ring had me nervous.  Took me back to my days as an amateur. He used that jab and won! #Warrior

Good luck to my fighter @AlbertBell132 on his 1st pro fight at Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress. I'll be there.
One thing about fighting... You gotta know who you're fighting.
To my son @amirjabron. Keep getting them! I am so proud of you.
Watching that fight changed me. I wanted to be an exciting charismatic fighter because of that fight.
On June 20, 1980 I saw Duran challenge Leonard for welterweight championship of the world. That day I wanted to be great.
Don't forget to get a @positivitybands. It's a great message, reminding us to stay positive and it's for charity.

If you're going there tonight to see me then you won't. I never agreed to have an official after party there.
I'm hearing Compound in ATL is promoting that I'm going to be there for an official after party for my one man show. This is NOT true.
