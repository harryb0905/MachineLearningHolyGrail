My DLg Showcase political hot take: Canadians made a bold, gutsy decision when they put @PetePranica on their 5-dollar bill. https://t.co/V7yxKEDtnf
@talkhoops @FanRagSports Congratulations! ... you'll still live-Tweet bad movies though, right?

@BobbyMarks42 @kpelton @teamziller also Ben Wallace making 3 straight 15-foot bank shots in Game 7!
@tomhaberstroh @TimBontemps correlation does NOT equal causation!
@TimBontemps @tomhaberstroh y'all definitely  increased the budget since I left.
@MainStMemphis @MyMikeCheck was fun just watching his proud papa enjoy it.
@espn_macmahon I am in favor
@ddotmarcus get back to work
@Lockedonsports red panda at the Georgia-Marquette game!!
@ChrisVernonShow so are you gonna listen to my mixtape or not?
@tomhaberstroh wait, what?!?!
@jadande you had to go there.
@dmorey copycat league.
@bruce_arthur @Pflanns make it stop
@bruce_arthur @Pflanns having flashbacks now.
@ZachLowe_NBA I do this often.
@ChrisVernonShow Rob Kelley and Kirk Cousins. It's gonna be like Timmy Smith and Doug Williams against the Broncos in the Super Bowl!
@ChrisVernonShow
@ChrisVernonShow I'm calling HR
@ChrisVernonShow Even with the glasses, nobody thinks you actually went to Princeton.
@kpelton @google @dmorey and this issue goes way deeper than basketball trade rumors. That's all I got right now.
@tomhaberstroh enjoy your trip to the Weedwacker Bowl. We have non-revenue sports to go dominate.
LOL my former ESPN colleague @nickfriedell on tv living the dream in Cleveland tonight https://t.co/MYojx9s0xY
I've seen cricket at-bats with fewer swings at bouncing pitches.
@langwhitaker @johnschuhmann league source confirms.
And that's why you keep going toward end zone instead of having Cousins kneel. Too far out to be a chip shot.
@johnschuhmann @kevinarnovitz schuhmann wins
@Lockedonsports glaring oversight. Already wrote an angry letter to the editor about this.
Tremendous free agent pick-up for Google. https://t.co/P5MTPfS6lS

@MyMikeCheck reunited at last!
@ChrisVernonShow I WANT NEW SCROLLS
@ChrisVernonShow not with Alfred Morris. C'mon man.
@PetePranica OMG this officiating
@netw3rk @kpelton Y'all need to come see this thing, it's spectacular.
@tomhaberstroh football shmootball. We have 16 ACC championships in swimming and diving.
@PetePranica @RhodesFootball glad they found somebody who knew how to pronounce "Willamette"

@SmithRaps added clear path rule and 8 seconds in the backcourt.
@jadande congratulations ... Tremendous free-agent pickup for the Northwestern Wildcats.
Horrible horrible horrible news today. RIP John Saunders, you were awesome.
@ChrisVernonShow that's how he rolls.
@JamesDa_Truth  thank you for coming back!!!!

@JustinVerrier @AminESPN I will be thrown out of this event for heckling.
Hey @delta can you put the gates at MSP further apart the next time I have such a tight connection? Think I can bang out another sub-7 mile.
@DraftExpress only 364 days. Tighten things up already.

@LAIreland A forgotten epic.
@DraftExpress2 @Mike_Schmitz #slacker
@HerringtonNBA ummm .... we increased payroll and sent cash to Charlotte
@HPbasketball can't believe you sold us out in the middle of the night like that
It's an outrage that second place wasn't unanimous. MY COLUMN:
@ESPNSteinLine also Stumptown at 10th and Stark if you're walking toward Powell's. Basically, just swing a cat and you'll hit something good
@ESPNSteinLine 1) Spella on 5th and Washington, 2) Public Domain on Broadway and Alder, 3) Barista on 3rd and Alder.
@AminNBA  545am wake up call overseas and this is first thing I see when I pick up my phone. #afraid

@HowardBeck @jadande The fact he's wearing a kilt doesn't even warrant mentioning because of everything else going on.
@HowardBeck 51 if you count @kevinarnovitz
@HowardBeck won't crack the top 50 of weird people you see in downtown PDX this weekend.

@sam_amick late to this but try Local on Main St. Enjoy your stay and come see us again!
It's early April and I'm getting a second straight 80-degree sunny day in Portland. Dare to dream people, anything is possible.
@bruce_arthur all they need now is Warren Moon  -- Played in Edmonton and was an Oiler.
@Mike_Schmitz @DraftExpress that, or he just stole your truck
@YourManDevine @johnschuhmann man I was soooooo close to getting credit for your Schuhmann's work.
@kelly_english @ChrisVernonShow LOL sorry Kelly I'm just trolling Verno. You were collateral damage.
@ChrisVernonShow Elwood's Debris Po Boy is an incredible sandwich. Love the Debris Po Boy at Elwood's. What a great sandwich #voteElwood
@ChrisVernonShow @HerringtonNBA you monster
@HerringtonNBA @ChrisVernonShow let's go Pho Saigon Bahn Mi!!!
@NickFriedell Congrats on the comeback, this will go down as one of the greatest vacated wins in your school's history. #notbitter
@talkhoops UNFOLLOWED
@NickFriedell remember to wear orange to the game tomorrow so you can melt into the throng of celebrating Virginia fans afterward.
@Pflanns you watch your mouth
Scout's tip: Don't be surprised if one of Virginia's kids solves a 3rd-order differential equation right in the jump-ball circle. #mathletes
@AminNBA @nbastats prove it's not Lady Bird
@ChrisVernonShow Vinny Verno says don't bet on The Verno
@ZachLowe_NBA by the time the wins are vacated you'll have left for the water polo job anyway.
@FlyerGrizBlog @HerringtonNBA  the Grizzlies appreciate your sacrifice Lipe.
@DerekBodnerNBA "Wichcraft"?
@AminESPN Walk. Hard. What does that even mean?
What up Murfreesboro?!?!?!?!?
@ChrisVernonShow Yale was my safety school.
@ChrisVernonShow please, you can't even spell Yale.
Congrats to my fellow Pdx-to-Mem traveler @Iambiggie503 and best of luck in the new gig at Pacific.
Red Panda at the ACC Tournament!!! cc: @Lockedonsports

@memgrizz @RickTrotter Earth, Wind and Trotter
@ChrisVernonShow His original 11:40 cancelled on him.
@FlyerGrizBlog NOT TRUE THIS IS A LIE
@hoopscritic lol keep trying bro you'll get one of these by blind luck eventually.
@teamziller lol let it go, man.
Hardest part of the business. Best of luck to @CourtneyLee2211 in Charlotte after 2+ great years with the Griz: https://t.co/6urscOeKCD
@HowardBeck at what point do you change your Twitter bio to say "Toronto" instead of "Brooklyn"?
@HowardBeck take the new train line from YYZ to downtown ... 30 minutes, no Gardiner, total godsend.
@BTRowland @NateDuncanNBA @DannyLeroux at the time I didn't fully grasp the long-term implications of giving "jetsam" such short shrift.
@tomhaberstroh A Virginia education includes advanced understanding of Euclidian geometric principles and angles of fiberglass refraction.

@AcrossTheCourt @SethPartnow it's actually exactly why I had it on that scale.
@FlyerGrizBlog only if @HerringtonNBA is traveling with you.
@peteredmiston Idea: Please write a "what's wrong with John Hollinger" column.
@AminESPN So disappointed. Don't tell me you pronounce the state "Horry gone" too.
@SethPartnow I prefer to say Memphis won.
All I can say is ...... YOU LIKE THAT!!!!!!
@PetePranica it turns out that blocking matters.
@bruce_arthur don't slow my roll right now
Things that I like:   1) That
@esd45suf yep. Ugh.
YOU LIKE THAT!!!!
Thanks GB for catching that punt over your head at the 7. Please do that again.
@ChrisVernonShow YOU LIKE THAT
Agony in the MSP SkyClub right now. Total devastation.
@Pflanns spectacular plot device for Good Will Hunting 3
@HerringWSJ @ZachLowe_NBA  lol I have an entire cemetery of Per Diem dead-ends on my old laptop.
@AminESPN @rick_bonnell I tried "Amin Elhassan" and crickets.
@AminESPN @rick_bonnell have never been able to get in the door.
@johnschuhmann some of us are preoccupied by challenging schoolwork.
@johnschuhmann Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.
@ChrisVernonShow Washington resting starters just to screw up Dallas's draft pick. This will be better than the Rypien Super Bowl.
Really, Portland? https://t.co/aa5WxhSB8O
@IraHeatBeat was just thinking they should take a knee on PAT if they score.
@ChrisVernonShow btw that ping you just heard is the long-forgotten alert you set on your phone for Brandon Weeden rushing touchdowns.
@ChrisVernonShow hey, sorry about your Cowboys but at least you can watch Brandon Weeden and Kirk Cousins start home playoff games.
@tomhaberstroh @kevinarnovitz eventually the water will regress to the mean.
@kpelton trust me, I wasn't the first.
@ChrisVernonShow Been traveling and haven't had chance to watch football. Who is in sole possession of first in the NFC East?
Sooooooo .... a robe you wish to have, mmmmmmmmmmmm?????? #FirstTeamAllJedi https://t.co/cPoiRsQsFw
@NickFriedell made her return at our home opener!
@Pflanns #thingsIdontmiss
@ChrisVernonShow it must kill you that there are 365 days in the year and you can only do this on 4 of them.
@ChrisVernonShow as long as our punt returner runs backwards for 20 yards I'm happy.
@ChrisVernonShow we lost at home to Matt Cassell. We're 5-7. And WE'RE STILL IN FIRST!!! #7-9divisionchamps #thedreamisalive
@ChrisVernonShow back at ya
@ChrisVernonShow look who's in first place. The dream of a 7-9 division title is in our grasp.
@johnschuhmann  We're too busy dominating non-revenue sports. But you guys got a good one.
Congrats to Justin Fuente on a great run at Memphis, and best of luck at Virginia's second-best state school.
@ESPNSteinLine PA at Fullerton playing "Timber". Use your pull and make them stop.
@ESPNSteinLine https://t.co/eNyw5T6RHW
Random hockey aside: Doc Emrick is just insanely good at his job.
@SethPartnow @kpelton next week vs San Anto!!!
@kpelton When is the next Sounders game? All I hear about is the Timbers game for some reason.
@kevinarnovitz just made me go to https://t.co/GKR8EPIJNy
@geoff_calkins @HerringtonNBA Come for the catfish, stay for the word "sigil"
@GaryParrishCBS It's a win-win -- earn Marriott points without having to stay at a Marriott!!!!
@ChrisVernonShow wasn't aware NFL had added a consolation bracket.
@ChrisVernonShow Are you discussing Kirk Cousins' perfect passer rating at top of show, or saving it for the afternoon?
@talkhoops I come all the way to Minnesota and you blow off the game. I see how it is.
Great win by @iowaenergy in Sioux Falls tonight! But disappointed I didn't meet the town's most famous resident..... https://t.co/AG6OToD1L2
I'm in Sioux Falls right now. Chances are, you're not. #analytics
@AminESPN These will be the best two days of your life.
@ESPNSteinLine so I watch one baseball game all year and they immediately shout out Fullerton.
@ChrisVernonShow btw Roser dropped  a "you like that" on me in the tunnel last night. It was beautiful.
@ChrisVernonShow oops I think I hit a nerve.
@ChrisVernonShow fact that may be of interest to you: Heath Shuler is still available.
Don't look now, but Washington is 8 bye weeks away from an NFC East championship.
@MattWelch @HowardBeck They did, however, keep Royce Webb, who was and remains awesome.
@AminESPN you sound like a fungi to be around.
@ChrisVernonShow Interesting NFL stat I came across today: Washington has more wins than the Cowboys.
No team has ever gone undefeated in summer league, preseason and regular season. Win tonight and we're 2/3 of the way there.
@kpelton @memgrizz cc @Lockedonsports
@bruce_arthur @ekoreen I want in if you guys discuss prorogation. I don't really know what it is but I like the word.
@ekoreen @bruce_arthur what's up with the polite, respectful debate? Canadian Twitter is so weird.
@FO_ASchatz @TheClammers How would you even tell?
@JMcDonald_SAEN also, "does the wifi work now?"
@RKalland @FlyerGrizBlog Robby still 100% accurate in his new sport.
@PetePranica @geoff_calkins yep both replay calls pretty clear.
Let's football Memphis. http://t.co/gnUPPwK7GG
@BobbyMarks42 At least he's not coaching my NFL team.
@SethPartnow redefines "cut fastball"
@mcten @NickFriedell But you got to see me in Columbus, Ohio. Pretty sure Nick's the jealous one here.
@jadande like being the Maytag repairman.
Columbus Day ... literally. http://t.co/f86hbQh9DY
One year ago - was in this gym watching this guy at Kentucky combine. http://t.co/9vB5rpSM3v
@ChrisVernonShow he threw a game-winning TD pass. #respect
@chrisvernonshow The uprights bend to Kirk Cousins' will.
@kpelton @tomhaberstroh will neither confirm nor deny.
@tomhaberstroh important: There's a really good microbrewery across from USC's arena.
@kpelton oh my goodness - I covered several of his HS games at Benson.
@FlyerGrizBlog with about A6 turnovers.
Final 5C-59, Grizzlies win!
@dmorey doesn't matter what base. All your base are belong to us. #geekmicdrop
@basketballvalue @dmorey doing imaginary numbers in regular season.
Preseason gamesmanship already starting - keeping stats in hexadecimal tonight to confuse @dmorey
New hot trend in analytics: Using your final TO to ice the kicker on an extra point.
@ChrisVernonShow how much did he pay Snyder, and more importantly when does Snyder go back to college?
@ChrisVernonShow Kirk Cousins just scores touchdowns.
@FlyerGrizBlog feature, not a bug. We're charging for media seats this year.
@kpelton plus a pick-six is their only chance of winning.
@ChrisVernonShow Not so fast. 14-2 is still in play.
@ChrisVernonShow This is God punishing you for that Boise State pick.
@ChrisVernonShow thanks for the Vinny Verno kiss of death, Einstein. Please pick our opponent next time.

@Sam_Vecenie is that for the first half or the game?
@geoff_calkins @slmandel my former SI cubemate reppin' the 901!
@ChrisVernonShow I'm here too, plus now I won't have to watch NFC East football. It's a win-win!
@PetePranica @NBATVJared Mahwah NJ represent!
@jadande or the regular season, apparently.
@FO_ASchatz Printing out this Tweet and framing.
@ChrisVernonShow keep pretending you don't fear this team. 1991 all over again.
@ChrisVernonShow Who finishes their career with more Super Bowl rings - Tom Brady or Kirk Cousins?
@MrMichaelLee Can't believe you painted that so quickly. Congratulations.
@bruce_arthur NO RELATION btw
NOT. COOL.
@ebehoops @talkhoops I had thought it was merely "disliked".
@talkhoops busted
@talkhoops btw now everyone in Canada will hate me and it's all your fault.
@talkhoops But another replay would have been nice.
@talkhoops Doornekamp extends right arm sideways, hit Vargas as he elevates, otherwise easy tip for win. That's how I saw it anyway.
@talkhoops more visible when they showed straight-on replay.
@ZachLowe_NBA A VenezWhaleOfA game. (ducks)
@kpelton OUTRAGED!!! Loved doing chat when I was there, even if I never quite matched your feats of endurance.
@ChrisVernonShow That's known as a Vinnie VerNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
@ChrisVernonShow so close to a 5 win season.
Looked at ESPN's NFL power rankings and got excited when I scrolled down to 30 and didn't see Skins. Then I remembered NFL has 32 teams...
Not a bad morning o' Eurobasket. Not bad at all.

@SmithRaps #neverforget http://t.co/S8QA8hKHeu
@ChrisVernonShow you fear Kirk Cousins. Admit it.
@ChrisVernonShow hoping for 6 so we can get to a bowl game.
@ChrisVernonShow we intentionally tanked the test so as not to crush the self-esteem of others.
@ChrisVernonShow I just say what the data tells me.
@ChrisVernonShow ask him why he has a ring and Tony Romo doesn't.
@Lockedonsports it's like school, but for kids who want to talk like Sean Connery.
@Matt_Calkins congratulations and well deserved! You didn't need sunlight anyway.

@bball_ref *find*
@bball_ref Former media members fined it useful too.
@JeffZillgitt @johnschuhmann great for those chilly mornings at the skeleton track.
@johnschuhmann kicked everyone out because I have that kind of power now.
Wait, they were only 2nd in the ACC this year? Hoo finished ahead of them?
@JMcDonald_SAEN UNFOLLOW
@SherwoodStrauss Can't believe you saw Heath Shuler at the airport.
@HerringtonNBA omg you're right
The right accessories are crucial for the modern basketball executive. http://t.co/tI4QNPOUPk
@FlyerGrizBlog bigger story is that @HerringtonNBA had never heard of Gorf. Inexcusable.
Woke up with 50 wins, a playoff berth and a plane ticket to Paris. Strong start to my day over here.
@Lockedonsports Disrespectful. Not sure we can still be friends after that.

@ChrisVernonShow this is the best awful game ever.
@ChrisVernonShow yowza.
@ChrisVernonShow you see what happened? I'm at game and they're not showing replay.
@ChrisVernonShow lying in wait, like a serpent. Or like roadkill. One or the other.
Feels like it would be easier to just hold SEC tournament in Lexington.
@ChrisVernonShow watch out Romo, Ryan Mallett's comin' for your job!!
@FiveThirtyEight pours one out for former MEM-AUS nonstop.
@jasonlmarch Cimmaron made the game-winning shot in the mascot game, so you have that going for you.
@jasonlmarch they did their best. It can be intimidating to play such a well-educated opponent.
@jasonlmarch HOO won the Virginia-Florida State game today?
@jonahkeri feel like Color Me Badd is flying under the radar here.
@johnschuhmann hey now let's focus on basketball.
First day of ACC tournament won't be the same today without the tradition of Va. Tech fans checking out of hotel just as I check in.

@tomhaberstroh don't you have a WAKE to attend?
@APkrawczynski I face away from the court and watch a monitor that scrolls 1s and 0s.
Off to scout ACC tournament. I wonder HOOS going to win.
LOTS of growl towels in Nola tonight! Hand hurts from all the people I had to high-five at end ... Heck of a rally on a b2b. #gng
@langwhitaker +1 on this. Highly recommend.
Shoutout to the Cuse fan who yelled "Noonan!" during last FSU free throws. #caddyshacklives
Great win on a b2b! #gng And now I can watch Duke and Carolina fight to be the team that finishes three games behind Virginia.
@talkhoops Tong Po was just as good. Only lost due to random variance.
@talkhoops make it stop
@ESPNSteinLine @HerringtonNBA Look, we can get Brian Teacher or Vijay Amritraj, but MANSDORF?!?! How much power do you think I have?
@ESPNSteinLine I'm hearing Tim Mayotte and Claudia Kohde-Kilsch will be at our game tomorrow. You totally should come. #bringSteintoMemphis
@talkhoops http://t.co/wxe4vEoh51
Congrats to @Nick_Calathes15 -- West Rookie of the Month!
@APkrawczynski @JMcDonald_SAEN Monroe's game-day outfits keep getting more elaborate.
Great to be back in the 901, even if it apparently became part of Saskatchewan while I was away.
@kpelton @jonahkeri So the trash talk about Youppi didn't throw him off his game?
Props to everyone at MIT for an outstanding #SSAC14 ... Best one yet IMHO.

@ChrisVernonShow @geoff_calkins @HerringtonNBA @GaryParrishCBS http://t.co/MayFMqI4PQ
@geoff_calkins @ChrisVernonShow @GaryParrishCBS "participant" probably better. Or perhaps "interested observer"
@geoff_calkins @HerringtonNBA my analytics still rate @ChrisVernonShow and @GaryParrishCBS as the worst-ever rib competitors.
@FoxxyShyD I can confirm!
@EvanDaniels me too! can't wait...
@michaelgrange @bruce_arthur is it ever not?
@ESPNSteinLine er, Wed.
@ESPNSteinLine but when are you coming to Memphis? Hearing Aaron Krickstein and Georgi Hagi will be at our game Tues. #bringSteinToMemphis
Best of all, as a deputy editor, @truehoop will have both a badge and a posse. 'Bout time.
Happy to hear three of my favorite people getting promoted - congrats @RoyceWebb @TrueHoop and Chris Ramsay!
@bruce_arthur if we hadn't cut Eruzione we win this #analysis
@jonahkeri the worst part was all the health care taunts.
@ArashMarkazi holy crap #facepalm Sorry about that ....
@jadande @ESPNSteinLine @kevinarnovitz "like having a Zagat guide on the team bus" said one scout of Arnovitz.
@MikePradaSBN welcome to Memphis sort of.
@AdamSchefter too soon
@jimhlavac just stay away from ours, please.
@jimhlavac what statheads call "the USC effect"
@SekouSmithNBA and still the best WR 'Skins ever had #84
@dmorey #hammalytics
@jonahkeri @ZachLowe_NBA OK walked right into that one....
@ZachLowe_NBA this is too much fun. You should coach more often.
@ZachLowe_NBA You can actually see him preparing to tune you out. Fascinating.
@kpelton @ZachLowe_NBA he just ran a play called "DeLorean doors". Already hearing whispers he won't make it to next celebrity game.
League execs already chuckling over @ZachLowe_NBA 's cover schemes. Any celebrity basketball fan knows Snoop can't  hard show on high screen
@Pflanns !!! I was the only person interviewing him at last Nawlins All star.
Advantage: Memphis. We are totally recruiting free agents with this http://t.co/DZufMTSpbM
Warning to ATLiens: Longest security lines I've ever seen at Hartsfield. (Was exiting, thankfully). If your flight is this century, go now.
@SekouSmithNBA  travel safe, good luck.
@LakerGMC @ESPNSteinLine Stein thinks about him every day.
Gonna make up a rumor that Ilie Nastase and Wojtek Fibak are at the game too. Maybe then @ESPNSteinLine will come to Memphis.

@tomhaberstroh Don't give us any ideas....
@kyleveazey political efficiency rating?
@kyleveazey you meant to say politics, government and tennis, right? Congrats and good luck in the new gig.
@wzzntzz Amazing work. I lived in Wheaton for a year in the 90s. Even then some folks confused it for Sochi.
Smaller scale, but this does make you appreciate the job Slovenia did at Eurobasket: http://t.co/y0s9kllsDe
@DarnellMayberry LOL .. Also could they get some new material now that its year six?
@kpelton little known fact: that was a random Tuesday in Ballard  five weeks ago.
@jadande @michaelsmith Smith knew it would be a quick party. Two steps ahead.
@teamziller or Norris Weese
@kpelton 's gonna go so crazy celebrating tonight that he crosses at a "don't walk" sign.
Seeing one team take an early 2-0 lead and then go in a defensive shell for 60 minutes made this @ESPNSteinLine 's favorite Super Bowl.
Word RT @nbastats Since Dec. 21, @memgrizz have the best record in the NBA (16-5). They're 4th in Defensive Rating (99.4) over that span
@jadande @jemelehill hill's roster looks better on paper but won't mesh on the court -- cold cuts and donuts? Nothing to drink? Disastrous.
@blazerbanter was just there last week and blown away ... Can't believe they did this after I left media world.
Finland beat Turkey, Greece and Russia at Eurobasket -- would have been kinda weird to leave them out and take the other three, no?
@briancmahoney "Dear Pit Bull" would have been too informal
@ZachLowe_NBA @BillSimmons Zach if you don't stamp your feet at opposing 3-point shooters I will be bitterly disappointed.
Great to be back in PDX! Spent the day briefing team on multiple-choice quiz they'll face when they try to throw something out.
@GaryParrishCBS All of the !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@NBAGuru we are *constantly* correcting people on that last one.
@JMcDonald_SAEN part of my evil ploy to make you work OT
Came to see UCLA-Arizona. Inadvertently got to see Flea play nat'l anthem. So that was cool.....
@kpelton @johnschuhmann ALWAYS Schuhmann, it was uncanny
@Pflanns @CoupNBA Disrespectful to Just Wright
@JMcDonald_SAEN We post that information prominently throughout the building.
Small solace for FSU fans, but maybe this will help ease sting of getting hammered by Virginia in basketball this weekend. #hoos
@draftexpress No. 1 on upgrade list, first class full. *what bitter irony*
@DraftExpress missed by three minutes. Think fondly of me while you enjoy the free liquor.
@DraftExpress nice to know there's an alternate plane of reality where I got the upgrade. (get it -- plane? I kill me)
@DraftExpress I'm gonna misconnect. You're home free bro, just don't board the plane until they upgrade you b/c otherwise you lose your spot
@teamziller so much this.
Back at the RAC... Long-ago memories of Mike Newline and Super John flooding in.
@kpelton live-tweeting rush hour on the NJ Turnpike? RT @keplton Fatigue leading to bad decisions right now on both sides.
Doing the Jersey college hoops double today - the Rock and the RAC!   PS I can't feel my toes.
@NickFriedell  This is way better than the Skins' Donovan McNabb deal. #advantagebears
@ChrisVernonShow If you weren't so used to this I'd be worried about tomorrow's pregame show.
@ChrisVernonShow hey now Skins still have a couple picks on second day
@ChrisVernonShow Orton out-Romoing Romo. Think he gets the job next year?
@bruce_arthur @WillBrinson make it stop
@AdamSchefter good times!
The Dolphins have declined Andy Reid's generous offer of a playoff berth.
Nothing but net all over Griz world tonight -- 120 for us and seven 3s for @JTiiii across the pond! http://t.co/4YWa2WyRSv
@CRomerDome @kpelton @kevinarnovitz Bringing extra-large suitcase on Jan. 28 to take it all back with me.
@ebehoops @kpelton @kevinarnovitz @CRomerDome too much competition for that spot.
@kevinarnovitz @kpelton You'll need to master art of jumping rail,  descending stairs, and ending at courtside just as half buzzer goes off.
@kpelton @kevinarnovitz Last one on the right in front of the radio guys? (sheds wistful tear)
@ChrisVernonShow @GaryParrishCBS losing time of possession battle to opponents with no hands still embarrassing.
34-22 run since Marv name-dropped me. Just sayin' ... #advancedstatsYES!
@ChrisVernonShow can't believe they'd ruin your Beef O'Brady's Bowl like this.
@ChrisVernonShow at least now Skins get a better draft pi.... er nevermind.
@DraftExpress Antwerp's gotta be right up there
Ouch RT @RyanKaltenbach . @johnhollinger has a great job. Why is he doing a commercial for a guitar video game? http://t.co/9SkpXrD6ZY
@ChrisVernonShow Kirk Cousins is the quarterback Tony Romo dreams of someday becoming.
Late on this but props to @JTiiii -- Baltic League player of the month! http://t.co/Gzoq1WLMWf
@jonahkeri sellout
And note @MacBo50 's Tennessee-shaped community assist award. Yet another reason Hawaii can't have a team.
@ChrisVernonShow oh man that was harsh. PS you're on the side of the guy who just defended Nickelback @GaryParrishCBS now who's laughing ...
@ChrisVernonShow @GaryParrishCBS Most scouts I talked to felt those kids just had a superior game plan and execution.
Rough night for @ChrisVernonShow - Stayed home to watch Cowboys embarrassed, while some dude schooled the ribs at Griz game. #freekyleorton
@ESPNSteinLine not only is the draw terrible, but the Germany game is on draft day.
Fun times scouting - got to troll @ESPNSteinLine about Fullerton game and run into old PDX pal @Matt_Calkins in same day.
Catch me at Sloan. Nobody bothers me there RT @kpelton So hard to catch up with @johnhollinger with fans constantly coming to him for photos
@kpelton the pocket square gives you away
Check out @kpelton in his courtside press seat while the pro scouts slum it further up.
State champs! RT @memgrizz become third team in @NBA history w/ 4-0 sweep of Cali swing. (DEN-1988 / SAS-1995 / MEM-2013)
@kevinarnovitz but Griz-Clips doesn't feel right without an Arnovitz sighting.
Liking this side of .500 better. Great road W vs. formidable opponent tonight. #gng
@jonahkeri @kpelton @billbarnwell Nearby towns that end in "ington"
@FlyerGrizBlog Jon Leuer!!!
@ChrisVernonShow you spelled Eagles wrong
@ChrisVernonShow wouldn't even crack Tony Oh-no-mo's top ten.
@ChrisVernonShow Romo would have lost that game more dramatically. RG still with much to learn from him.
@mtokito to be played in a frigid Memorial Coliseum?
@jadande one-hander.
Always great seeing my former colleague @jadande at Staples. Hope he's writing about a Griz win in two hours.
@MrMichaelLee "distressed" baggage is the new fashion thing.
@ChrisVernonShow How bout dem Cowboys!!!!!!!!! #onegamebackinlosscolumn #NFCLeastFTW
Shoutout to Mr. and Mrs. @DraftExpress on their big day! Congratulations! .... And now we know why he set up @DraftExpress2 account :-)
@ChrisVernonShow man now they'll have to finish 3-4 to catch Dallas for division title.
HA! Nobody expects the fullback! So long San Diego ....
Lots of credit to Dallas mayor @ESPNSteinLine for arranging such a beautiful day for our visit. B2B for the #GNG crew tonight vs. Mavs.
Heck of a first win! Coach Joerger now has the best home-court winning percentage of any coach in NBA history. #GNG
@stackmack sorry but I'm not nearly cool enough to come up with that playlist.
Say it ain't so, Red Panda. I've been consoling @lockedonsports all morning.
@jonahkeri thanks but you're far too kind ...
@jonahkeri feel like focus on ruling has buried the more amazing fact that Molina went first-to-third on a double.
Was trying to write "intentional"... Autocorrect magically made it "international" ... Which, ironically, was not intentional.
Thought that was the right call. Just when I was so proud of Sox resisting knee-jerk international walk right there.
@Pflanns with the first-ever HBP premonition recorded on Twitter.
RT @ChrisVernonShow Thrilled to be joining the @memgrizz TV broadcast team. I'll be on the "Grizzlies Live" pregame show every home game.
@FlyerGrizBlog @HerringtonNBA We haven't decided yet whether to do this to you or continue doing it to Herrington.
@bruce_arthur If you switched to Farenheit it would be 32 degrees warmer. Mention this at your next cabinet meeting.
Highlight of Toronto trip: Reuniting with Canadian president @bruce_arthur ... gotta get him back on hoops beat somehow.
@FlyerGrizBlog oh I have more than a couple.
@stackmack gonna pass on the poutine but tell me more about these ketchup chips.
Oh man almost forgot -- Toronto tweeps, where's the good coffee at?
@APkrawczynski @Pflanns took the last train INTO your heart, undoubtedly.
@ekoreen can't even work up a coherent defense of the pints-quarts-gallons thing....
Wheels up for Toronto! Need to brush up on my metric system - how do I convert gallons to Celsius again?
@BillSimmons @30for30 great call... That story would break the Internet if it happened today.
On a positive note, the Giants have become my favorite LeaguePass team.
Wow. Don't think I've ever seen a team commit two different penalties while giving up a punt return TD. #NFCLeastStyle
@ChrisVernonShow KIRK COUSINS
@ChrisVernonShow yep. ~70,000 people next door watching Falcons.
@ChrisVernonShow NFC Least baby!
Paid my last-ever Ga. 400 toll today. (Cue violin) ... Griz and Hawks about to tip.
Important seasonal reminder: Pumpkin-flavored coffee sucks just as much in autumn as it does the rest of the year.
@kpelton @kevinarnovitz Must be some kind of typo -- I don't see Atlanta or Memphis on there.
Pretty sure that was a moving pick by the 3rd base umpire.
@ESPNSteinLine subtitle: The Worst 90 Seconds in Panamanian Sports History
Somebody tell Jurgen to pull the goalie.
@ChrisVernonShow small sample size.
@ChrisVernonShow coaching staffs with more penalty yards than the players. #nfcLeaststyle
Looks like I'll miss Redskins-Cowboys tonight. Will have to just listen for @ChrisVernonShow 's tears.
@ESPNSteinLine Can't believe Mexico pulled that out. Was really looking forward to seeing Jurgen 'experiment' with a 1-2-8 against Panama.
Don't wanna brag, but somebody just crossed "drive from Memphis to St. Louis" off the bucket list today.
@dmorey based on world cup qualifying results, was going to answer "Mexico"
Most definitely. Some strong options in West End. RT @Jed_Kaplan Good coffee in Nashville?
Enthusiastic house at Griz open practice in Nashville, right before my 40-minute presentation on regression analysis. http://t.co/GW3joh3m5I
Bonus points for Nashville: my morning brew at Fido has been top notch.
@APkrawczynski Way deeper. Based on sixth-order differential equation of ancient formula that we hand-translated from the orginial Sanskrit.
Rays unbeaten in last three months when Molina attempts to steal a base #analytics
We have a winner ... RT @StarsStripesFC The US government is as active as the Azteca scoreboard.

! #Ilovethisdivision RT @daldridgetnt If Broncos beat Cowboys next wk, 2-3 Dallas will play 1-3 Washington for division lead on Oct. 13th.
@ChrisVernonShow 2nd place! One game out of first! #Ilovethisdivision
Even Jacksonville scored a TD against Oakland's D. 'Skins still got 23 more minutes to match that feat ...
@jadande @kevinarnovitz Totally true. Always looked forward to "nesting" before Game 3.
If changing the Finals format helps @kevinarnovitz and @jadande get Platinum status, I'm all for it.
Are you referring to this game, this season, or this century? RT @rick_bonnell Ugly start for Redskins.
Glad somebody from UVA produced a touchdown this weekend. Disappointed that it took til Sunday. #Schaubnation

To-do list: 1) grit 2) grind 3) repeat
@tomhaberstroh  nooooo!!!!!
One positive thing about this new gig is that I'm too busy to go on an absolutely epic Twitter rampage about RGIII.
Finally got a chance to see our box score ... holy hellington!
Don't know what DLeague record was for longest regulation game. Only know that Reno and Springfield are shattering it.
@johnschuhmann Reno 89, Springfield 89, 3:01 left. #dleaguepassalert
@AnnieMPeterson  sure, NOW they put snacks on press row. Lotta good that'll do me.
Chilling with Scott Schroeder and Sebastian Pruiti in the showcase's Internet-to-front office ghetto.
Great D in Phoenix tonight to start road trip. Now off to Reno for DLeague Showcase and emotional reunion with @ESPNSteinLine
Ok, time for Griz to salvage my Sunday!
@ChrisVernonShow RG3 on one leg &gt;&gt; Romo on 2 or more legs
Does a bad knee make you throw wounded ducks? Asking for a friend.
!! Holy double-take RT @teamziller Head wound alert on the sideline pan.
Never knew Redskins had an ice fishing shed behind bench
Why is that fan in background wearing a "J. Campbell" jersey? Was "H. Shuler" not available? Feels like we're off to a bad start here.
Big evening ahead. In Phx with Griz vs. Suns tonight ... but first gotta see RG3 carve up the chicken-of-the-Seahawks
Former trade machine maestro @billsimmons so rattled by Griz he's proposing cap-illegal trades.
Sorry @billsimmons ... great team effort tonight, fingers crossed for Jerryd.
Rted @ZachLowe_NBA piece that nominates Griz's Marc Gasol as Defensive Player of Year. Great read as always.
The fumble troll for Dallas fans at the end might be my favorite football moment ever.
I would not want to be @ChrisVernonShow 's liquor cabinet right now.
@ChrisVernonShow real quick since game is starting: Should I send  the sympathy card to your home or work address?
Big test vs. Denver tonight ... of whether my well-documented Nugget-cursing abilities as a writer can carry over to front office.
@ESPNSteinLine Great stuff as always, appreciate the Weekend Dime shoutout.
The real reason I took the Memphis job http://t.co/rMc0dWyQ
@ChrisVernonShow Hey now, Hall is important for us. He helps our receivers' self-esteem in practice.
@ChrisVernonShow gonna be awkward when we give Romo game ball after game-clinching pick-six. You'll be begging to trade for Kirk Cousins.
@chrisvernonshow if you want to see a real exterminator, watch what RG3 does to Dallas's season on Sunday.
Also, it appears the difference between Memphis and Atlanta is that Memphis has an actual winter. http://t.co/TnEgK0xT
Missed this while I was flying, but excited for @kpelton 's PER Diem debut: http://t.co/c2tiGVr3
Merry Grizzmas!
Grit n grind &gt;&gt; Mayans. Stat of night: D. Arthur holds opponents to 0% shooting when defending with one shoe.
Saw @swish41 warm up pre-game. He's coping without my Twitter snark well.
Just realized I'm going to have start paying for Insider. #irony
Big win thanks to amazing D (80 pts. on ~100 trips). If world ends Friday will finish front office career undefeated. #mayans
. @ZachLowe_NBA Had a good laugh with @aa000G9 at shootaround today
Missed opportunity MT @ZachLowe_NBA Sort of disappointed @johnhollinger didn't rig Power Ranks on way out to keep Memphis as permanent No. 1
Here's best part of that bike lanes gag: I don't actually own a bike. MT @jfloetry Have you tested the bike lanes in Memphis yet?
Awesome first day of work. Really appreciate the warm welcome, Memphis.
Not so much in-game snark, but I'll be around .... RT @CarsonC5 are you still going to tweet with the Griz?
Today's Per Diem debut from @tomhaberstroh ... and he crushed it just like I knew he would. http://t.co/0j1gkAJK
Hardest column I've ever written. Thanks to everyone at ESPN for an amazing 8 years: http://t.co/6idMxOdG

OK, Heat actually were allowed to sub. Commence ripping Spo for playing Ray Allen on last-second defensive poss.
@TrueHoop Not so fast on O.J. - Mavs can only pay him $4.8M unless they give up some of that cap space.
Underrated move last night: GS didn't sub in final 0:20 timeout, forcing Miami to keep Ray Allen on court on defense.
Don't believe I linked this yet -- here's yesterday's Per Diem on some positive surprise stories (Insider) http://t.co/y4H4vZJm
Just saw Courtney Kirkland's closeout on Kris Humphries; think there might be a job for him on Clipper coaching staff.
Did Brand just dribble off his own face?
@NickFriedell @KCJHoop Kirk was hurt all the time in ATL too.
@ZachLowe_NBA was listening to this on XM while driving -- broadcasters sounded like post-game harakiri was a real option.
Mattered hugely -- offensive foul would have nullified the 3. RT @nuss006 it really didn't matter though.....he didn't hit the free throw.
btw, if the Okafor-Ariza deal really ended up preventing Wiz from trading for Harden (via tax concerns), that's just awesome.
Re: flops, people asking me about Kidd play from last night. Not a flop. The contact was real. Ref just made terrible call.
Solution: Bring back Mike Brown RT @tomhaberstroh 07-08 Cavs took Boston to 7 gms in East semis. Furthest a 9-12 team has gone last 15 yrs.
@ZachLowe_NBA Might be best of the year.
If you missed the flop videos for the newly-warned Omer Asik and @zaza27 - well, they're spectacular: http://t.co/tsy7idFZ
@ZachLowe_NBA Speights isn't trade eligible at all unless he approves it. Technically a one-year non-bird.
Blazers set a record for most 3 points attempts without a make; previous mark was 18.
Blazers 0-20 on 3s, Raps 3-21. Only accurate long range shot tonight was Amir Johnson pegging the ref with his mouthpiece.
Final: Blazers 92, Bacon 74. Teams combined to shoot 3-for-41 on 3s. Now working to remove this game from my memory as quickly as possible.
The Blazers are 0-20 from the 3-point line and winning by 16. #Torpor
One thing I wonder about with Valanciunas: Dude is pretty darn slow in transition. Needs to run harder.
Raps have stopped going inside because Babbitt has them terrified.
THATS LUKE BABBITTS HOUSE
Apparently I just got a shoutout from Toronto's TV broadcast. Hopefully I get free bacon out of this.
Lillard and Pavlovic both back on court, so apparently ankle turns not serious. Portland is 0-16 on 3s and still leads Bacon by 10.
Raps didn't have room for Aaron Gray in their rotation, but he's helping them right now.
No bad days in this job. But sometimes bad basketball. RT @Bmurphy47 where does this game rank on the worst days on the job list?
Bacon rallies to make it 64-59 game at end of 3. Fans begin rousing "please, not overtime" chant.
Damian Lillard turns an ankle challenging a Jose Calderon jumper. We're up to three injuries and an ejection if you're scoring at home.
"OK Jared, we'll let the four steps after the catch go, but you also charged and missed the shot anyway"
Now Sasha Pavlovic is hurt, looks like might have turned an ankle.
Johnson will likely get a multi-game suspension for throwing his mouthpiece. Also, he needs a new mouthpiece.
Johnson grabbed ball after free throw and wouldn't let him have it back, basically wrestled him for the ball. I've never seen that.
Excitement! Out of the blue, Amir Johnson gets thrown out and whips his mouthpiece at ref David Jones for good measure.
FYI, earlier JJ Hickson drew his first charge of the season. See, there WAS a reason to come to the arena tonight!
Why does Sasha Pavlovic turn into a real NBA player every time I show up at one of his games? This is getting amazing.
Claver right now is a slasher who can't finish. Wee bit of a problem.
Torpor Bowl update: Bacon fails to score for 3 minutes against Portland's mighty Hickson-Babbitt frontcourt. 44-40 Blazers at half.
I can hear coaches counting down shot clock from halfway up on other side of floor.    Very rare this happens to me in Portland.
Whomever has Kyle Lowry's mojo, could your please return it to the lost and found?
For those not watching, Nolan Smith is wearing day-glo orange sneakers. Tough to miss him out there.
To prevent us from ever hearing it RT  @AnnieMPeterson Why do they play Miley Cyrus when Nolan Smith scores?
Raptors call timeout after permitting the best three minutes of Nolan Smith's career.
After tongue-lashing from Stotts on Friday, Meyers Leonard now behind Jared Jeffries in playing time queue.
Screen-and-roll for LA after he catches for a left-block face-up? That just happened.
98-second rest for Aldridge. Stotts seems committed to having at least one of LA or Lillard on court all game.
End of 1, it's Bacon 19, Blazers 18. Only thing that would make this worse is if Nickelback had sung Canadian anthem.
Weirdest part of that play - Bargnani was going for a statue of liberty dunk from at least ten feet away, like he thought he was Dr. J.
Bargnani down on floor holding his elbow after a very hard fall. Now headed to locker room.
Sadly, my suggestion of in-game OTR for media tonight was turned down. RT  @BlazerFreeman This game is ... just ... hard to watch.
I'd say Pietrus is taking an "if I'm ever getting a 20 in a game again, this is the night" mentality into this one.
Greetings from the Torpor Bowl in Portland, where Sasha Pavlovic and Victor Claver are your starting wings against the Toronto Bacon.
Coach isn't problem. Squeezed blood from a stone last yr. RT @KevinRashidi Wow excellent article on the raptors. Can you become our coach?
Possible Blazers just play 3 on 5 MT @jwquick Matthews (hip) and Batum (back) out tonight. Stotts will not reveal who starts in their place
@ZachLowe_NBA guess who's going to the Torpor Bowl tonight?
Late to this but I'm with @kpelton 100% ... Pac NW berries are kings of the fruit jungle.
Not an MD but I play one on Twitter: based on my brief reading on hip flexor injuries, Matthews may be out a few weeks.
Kings win 99-80 in a dramatic, triumphant return for Travis Outlaw.
Sac with 21 assists, 9-17 on 3s tonight. Offensively, looked like a real basketball team except in 2nd quarter. #babysteps
Theory: Kings finishing game with Travis Outlaw at SF as a test to see just how bad Blazers' bench is.
Haven't seen replay, but I think Hickson just fouled Aldridge and prevented a put-back dunk.
I like this gamble by Stotts -- down 12, 10 min left, has Aldridge in with five fouls.
@kpelton Travis Outlaw has to get his run.
Matthews tried to return, may have made whatever his injury is worse. On floor for long time, now limping off. I'd say he won't be back.
If Batum and Matthews are both out, Blazers potentially looking at a Pavlovic-Price wing combo Monday. Run for your lives.
Stotts having a long talk with Meyers Leonard at this timeout about a blown rotation on that last Kings basket.
Matthews looks like he's favoring something too -- ankle maybe? Did a little in first half and more now.
Batum went up for that with I-just-dont-want-to-hurt-my-back-on-this vigor. Moral victory he landed upright.
With Batum hurting, why is he guarding Salmons while Matthews is on the guy standing in corner every play?
Brooks dribbles into crowd, falls down, saved from TO  by fact Cousins was just crossing time line with 16 on clock. Kings basketball, baby.
John Salmons has 7 assists already, the most for any King in the last five years. #madeupbutcouldbetrue
It would be awesome if the statistician in Boston had actually been in a bar fight.
What a sweet finish to half for Lillard. Perfect 2-for-1, kick-out for Wes 3 and then great pass to get Wes shot at rim (missed).
Outed RT @BlazerFreeman @johnhollinger you were just in search of some off the record pale ale...
Seriously, if you like watching mediocre post players iso on every play, turn on Blazers-Kings right now. Enthralling stuff.
@BlazerFreeman Any time you can get Kings, Raptors and Blazers in one weekend, you book tickets first and ask questions later.
If you like bad offense this second quarter has been tremendous.
Nobody ever confused James Johnson with Reggie Miller, but he's seriously got the yips this year.
That was an exciting performance of the one-act play "I have no right hand" by Luke Babbitt.
Affirmative MT @SteveKerrTNT With Ray Felton and Jamal Crawford having fantastic seasons, Blazer fans must be going nuts.
TOO. MUCH. BABBITT. He's the game's high scorer right now!
Kings lead 30-18 at end of 1, after a perfect Jared Jeffries feed to Marcus Thornton to end quarter. You read that correctly.
Of course, if the alternative is a Jared Jeffries contested 2 off the dribble, by all means, post up Wessy
Another post up for Matthews against a bigger player. Guys, he can't jump. Stop doing this.
Batum just attempted a reenactment of JaVale's alleyoop. That was fun. Blazers can't stop the mighty Kings' offense either.
Maybe post-ups for Matthews against a guy two inches taller aren't a great idea. Just a thought.
By Atlanta standards this is a packed house, but for the Rose Garden this place is pretty empty tonight. Won't even be a fake-sellout.
Kings start Garcia-Brooks in backcourt. No Tyreke Evans tonight.
Greetings from Portland, where I've sent myself solely to confuse @MSteinmetzCSN .. . Blazers and Kings ready to tip off here.
@MrMichaelLee Jackson's own team passed on him at 30
@ZachLowe_NBA Check out the bizarre Vince iso Dallas runs in last 2 min. I don't even know who they are anymore.
Just finished Mavs-Suns. Three-word scouting report: Aggggghhhhh my eyes!!
Somehow, some way, the Knicks have stumbled into something pretty special. Heat D looked like it was killing a power play.
.@ESPNSteinLine if there's no Nash and no Nowitzki, is it still the Stein Bowl? So confused....
Hint: rhymes with "pench Peasley" MT @paulcoro Gentry "more than likely" will use same lineup but "still have to look at some other options"
Chatting in five minutes on http://t.co/UjMndCER at this link: http://t.co/9UAoPSr1
@MikeWellsNBA particularly brutal TO on dribble handoff to cap an already brutal night.
Collision....yikes. Carlisle used a TO just to pull him. Tough to argue with it.
I can't even identify an intended receiver on some of these Mayo TOs.
This Odom-Fisher battle has been riveting.
Waking up w/ LAC-Dal. Clips open game with a series of isos for Caron Butler. Huh?
Except he scored 32 points first. RT @TMNTFreak0024 Lawson had a Feltdown
Hawks win 108-104. In a rarity, key is that Nuggets were owned on boards. Faried foul trouble obviously key to that.
Lawson dribbles off own foot, Smith scoops it up for dunk-and-one. Hollinger Nugget Curse, In Effect
Iguodala is 1-9 with six turnovers. Denver has run S/R for him last two trips.
Have no fear, Nuggets: Kevin Scott is here to re-set the shot clock for you.
Lawson PROgressing to the mean!
He say anything about Toronto Bacon? MT @AlexKennedyNBA Stern: ‚ÄúIf Charlotte wanted to change to Hornets that would be OK with me.‚Äù
Denver with ball and chance to take lead, 2:52 to go. My well-earned Nuggets-cursing rep is in serious jeopardy right now.
TOO. MUCH. MOZGOV.
If Al Horford was a giraffe that pass would have been perfect.
So the real issue is that fans couldn't see Danny Green. Glad we're clear on that.
at 10:30 am RT @JMcDonald_SAEN ... "they sent a 26-year-old and 30-year-old plus Manu and Timmy home virtually under the cover of darkness."
Why is Andre Miller guarding Lou williams?
Such a vintage JaVale play. Jumps up to goaltend shot, wises up in midair and lets it go, but now can't get rebound --&gt; ATL put-back.
Gallo is really upset that none of the multiple bumps from ivan Johnson got him a whistle. 85-78 Hawks after 3.
Hawks' big lineup first 3 shots: Josh from 18, Josh for 3, Josh from 20. War Hawks.
George Karl talked pre-game about trying to get to 20 made FTs a night. He's at 17 already.
Pachulia-Johnson-Josh frontcourt for ATL, against Denver smallball unit. Power vs. speed.
McGee is having some epic defensive breakdowns here.
DeShawn Stevenson is shooting approximately 97% on 3s with me in the building this year.
George Karl irate that Lawson didn't get a foul call on that jumper.
Four fouls on Faried. Hawks working that block hoping for just this thing.
Iguodala was 0-5 with five turnovers... until he just dunked on Josh Smith. Wowza.
Ty Lawson regressing to the mean in a big way tonight. Making every jumper.
Best part of that slo-mo replay was Kidd's bear-hug on Mullens. That's one way to stop the roll.
@rick_bonnell far and away leading league in 24 violations
Wicked cross-body, cross-lane pass to corner by Devin Harris, who ends up past the camera guys and in the first row.
Nice hustle Josh
So true. RT @Eisenberg43 Zaza doing his best Mozgov impression.
Zaza has 11 points in the first half despite missing three uncontested lay-ups. Nuggies'  D a wee bit suspect tonight.
Say this for Teague: If you let him grab the ball with two hands and then dribble again, he can beat almost anyone to the basket.
"I'll see your bogus continuation, Kane Fitzgerald, and raise you this dubious 3-pt foul" - Kevin Scott
Saw another Nugget in there eating media meal but I must have missed Dre.
Man, Andre Miller does NOT look good tonight.
"Paris yes, China no" RT @MikePradaSBN David Stern on the Hornets broadcast. Says he'll do "a little bit internationally" once he steps down
@jadande ESPN alert tonight!
Williams wanted that Lou-for-1 soooo bad. You could see him thinking about pulling up from 40 with 28 on the clock.
Back to back illegal screens for Nuggets. Good heavens, is that Anthony Randolph checkin in?
Doh! RT @KevinDing Now in the timeout huddle, Dwight is standing up and pointing a finger in the face of the seated Kobe.
Karl said he'd probably play two PGs most of the night since Hawks force so many TOs, but only used one thus far.
I keep hoping for Mozgov to do something hilarious but actually he's been really competent. Maybe JaVale can fix this.
Follow-up: Blame Zillgitt (RT coming)
@BlazerFreeman smart targeting -- you know how us media guys are always chartering our own jets everywhere.
Wrongful airball chant alert! Mozgov just barely catches rim from 17 and crowd lets him have it.
And we're off .. .Lawson has to take that 3, I don't care how much he's been struggling.
Greetings from the NBA's only arena to hang a banner for Widespread Panic. Hawks and Nuggets about to tip off on ESPN. No Korver, no Koufos.
Also, the Hawks recalled John Jenkins today, but only after they were shown a photograph and given several hints.
@chrismannixSI @KCJHoop caller was Jason Kidd
Unintentional comedy alert: No Koufos for Nuggets tonight. Mozgov starting. Possibility of Mozgov-McGee lineup looms.
@sportsguy33 But how does it impact  your on-air/off-air plus-minus?
Chauncey Billups earns warning for game-winning flop in Utah; Gerald Wallace joins Reggie Evans as repeat offender. War Brooklyn.

Best suggestion I've heard: New Orleans Sinners. A) city-appropriate, B) Benson would own Sinners and Saints.
Of my proposed names, Toronto Bacon definitely most popular with @ replies. May just start using it on my own.
Wayne Ellington made seven 3s against Miami ... and has seven 3s combined in his other 15 games.
More revised nicknames on tap: Atlanta Pollen, L.A. Stars, Utah Lakers, Toronto Bacon
Also, if we pool our resources, can we pay the Central Division to go away?
Just finished Indy-Chi. Last play a great example of what Hibbert's done all year: Going straight up and using size to alter shots.
Never mind, apparently playing thru Josh Howard is the key to dissecting elite defenses. Big win for the Ice Road Truckers tonight.
Just cued up Min-Phi. When did we get to the point that the Wolves are calling plays for Josh Howard?
Winner RT @mikefinger @JMcDonald_SAEN Would it now be fair to say Anthony Davis is a glorified version of a pelican?
Great chance for Perk to do Q&amp;A about amnesty process. RT @DarnellMayberry Kendrick Perkins will be defending Andray Blatche.
@jadande Krewe would be awesome if more than 5% of people outside NOLA knew meaning. I liked Brass -- short, sweet, connected.
@ramonashelburne yah, was doing my best to ignore that one.
You know what's awkward? When somebody compliments you on a piece somebody else wrote.
@BlazerFreeman L.A. knows about that whole charge circle rule, right?
Portland scored on its last 11 trips vs. Charlotte to tie game. 25 points in the final 5:31.
Down 3 with six seconds left, I thought Mo Williams should have intentionally missed free throw.
Just finished Clips-Jazz. I'm sure that flop warning Billups gets will make Utah feel a lot better.
Just finished Bucks-Hornets. I'm enjoying this Joel Meyers-David Wesley crew. Not enjoying Bucks' rotation du jour system.
Those footsteps you heard are the 'Skins coming for ya.....
Odds of a play ending that way are miniscule. I don't mean the fumble; I mean Morgan scoring a touchdown.
Has a chance. Probably best candidate I left off. RT @ColinMcGoodtime no Ibaka on potential 1st time allstars?
@BeckleyMason bizarrely there just aren't any free throws in between.

@dwightjaynes Cavs beat on same cut in same spot by ATL's Lou Williams for game-tying 3 24 hours earlier.
Lakers D never struggled this much before they fired Juan Castillo.
Correction: The Lakers got one stop on Orlando's final 12 trips. Two in the final 18. http://t.co/dK9AEkj7
Right now the big loser in the 4-team Dwight Howard trade is everybody.
Someone care to tell Fox that they have an OT game going on right now?
Analysis: I think its obvious by this point that the Rams and Niners are evenly matched teams.
Also: A substitution in overtime! Griz went Bayless for Pondexter two minutes in.
Just finished Mem-SA. Great gamble by Pop to send in the midgets to start 4th.
@uuords word. (See what I did there?)
@johnschuhmann and he still didn't get into the paint on that play!
Btw as a veteran Joe Johnson watcher, gotta say he's looking a step slower. Not getting by guys with those hesitation moves.
Skiles put Mbah a Moute on Terry last 2 trip so he could switch s/r he expected from Boston and end up on Pierce. Pretty clever.
OK this Stackhouse thing is getting ridiculous.
WHAT. A. GAME.
@jadande its Kerry Park. Just up the hill from Key Arena.
Can't agree more with @JMcDonald_SAEN last Tweet. I covered '10 Phx-SA series. Duncan was a traffic cone.
@talkhoops my angle on that play was straight from side and I thought ball deflected off side of rim.
I suddenly see you as remarkably well-adjusted. MT @ESPNChiBulls I've been watching UCF Football all my life.
Just finished Kings-Pacers. As @MikeWellsNBA noted, David West's old guy moves were in peak form last night.
My $0.02: Weirdest part of MAC-Orange Bowl thing is how Kent was ever ranked ahead of NIU.
Fitting ending: Cavs had as many ORB (18) as Hawks had defensive boards. In retrospect, maybe playing three 6-2 guards wasn't the way to go
Alonzo Gee slips along baseline for game-winning put-back with 0.4 left. Cavs win. Crowd stunned.
Nice D Cleveland.
Andy now needs two boards in final 15.8 for a 20-20 game. Or he can just leave somebody open for a 3 and get it in OT.
@johnschuhmann still time to make it weakest 7-game win streak in recent memory.
Waiters sets up Varejao go-ahead bucket, then converts drive on next trip. 21-7 for the rook, Cavs up by 4 with 25.5 left.
Sure looked like that was off Varejao from up here. No replay either.
Good Josh shows up, gathers rebound, dribbles full-court, makes perfect kickout for Lou's game-tying 3. 105-105, 1:16 left.
Iso-Pargo! Teague bottles him up, Pargo scores anyway. Cavs by six.
Didn't really see the part coming where Jeremy Pargo destroys Jeff Teague.
Lou Williams tries a 2-for-1, except with 4:57 on the clock.
Varejao back in. Cavs' dueling-Jason alignment was a +8. #intimidation
Hawks call TO as Cavs cut lead to 3 with 6:09 left. Still on track for worst seven-game winning streak in sports history.
@kpelton think Josh is technically the 3 in this lineup. He even went to corner and shot  (and made!) a 3 in first half.
New Blazer promo: Free tacos if a bench player scores a basket.
BTW Andy V is three-fourths of the way to a quiet 20-20
Tonight's end-of-quarter hilarity is brought to you by Ivan Johnson. Hawks lead 91-82 at end of 3rd.
@ZachLowe_NBA a Lou-for-1 at 39.4 -- has he lost his touch?
Jeff Teague for 3 off a pindown. Did that just happen?
Rule of thumb: A Blazer season hasn't officially gone off the rails until they lose by 83 points in Boston.
Lethargic start to third quarter for Hawks. 11-point halftime lead down to one.
Josh from 20, contested, with 13 on clock. #awesome.
If Jeff Green plays against Portland's bench every night @sportsguy33 is totally gonna win our bet.
@MrMichaelLee movie is called "Just Wrong", based on 2010-12 Wizards.
Ivan Johnson for 3! Hawks go into the half up 67-56. Cavs D was so bad that I found myself looking for Don Nelson on sideline.
New stat: When a tertiary player stops the ball for five seconds, I propose we call it a "Gee"
Hawks entered at No. 1 in defensive efficiency. Waiters is a 20-year-old rookie in 16th NBA game and they can't guard him. Impressive stuff.
Man, Waiters is just killing these guys. 12 pts, 4 ast in 2nd quarter alone. If Cavs played any D at all Hawks would be in real trouble.
Dion Waiters is murdering DeShawn Stevenson.
I'm not saying Donald Sloan was an obscure Hawk, but last year he played more minutes in Philips as a Cav (11) than as a Hawk (10).
Cavs went "dueling Jasons" just now with Thompson and Zeller. If I was a camp counselor, I'be worried.
Casspi for 3! In a Dallas basement, Marc Stein gives an emphatic fist-pump before returning to his Manchester City 2012 highlights DVD.
Hawks up 2 on Irving-less Cavs, so far they're well on way to making this the worst 7-game win streak in history.
Josh gets the coveted turnover-leading-to-dunk + technical foul combo, and it's a tie game.
Josh long 2 with 15 on the clock. #awesome
BTW, if you're in Atlanta tonight and a friend tells you they're late because of "Hawks traffic," they're definitely lying.
Josh only has one foul, not two. Mistakenly trusted Philips scoreboard, which has well-deserved rep for crazy-wrong stats.
Left-block post-up for a fadeaway contested 15-footer by Josh. #awesome
Two quick fouls on Josh. Also, not sure why they're posting him on left block when he's so much better on right.
Pargo blows right by Teague for a trip to free-throw line, while every Memphis fan wonders where this was last year.
No Korver for Hawks, who go small (!) vs. Raggedy Andy and the Cavs by playing Horford at C, Smith at PF, Zaza off bench.
Greetings from the Hawks-Cavs "family reunion" game ... nearly everybody in Hawks FO used to work for Cavs, and vice-versa.
@stackmack word. Alvin's great.
Crucial overlooked detail: By deciding this in July, Pop was probably able to book a discounted advance-purchase fare on SW.
Awesomeness. RT @NdeBasket: Arguably the "flop of the year" in Europe...by an American player. http://t.co/sOJdIxRn
Its Friday the 30th, but Cavs looking more Friday the 13th tonight: Both Zeller and Thompson donning "Jason" masks in warm-ups.
How much "timelier" can you inform everyone than by flying the players home the morning after a game?

@talkhoops on positive note, you finally have a floater.
Tomorrow's Per Diem coming tonight -- just filed on Spurs/Stern silliness.
This is an unacceptable decision by a commissioner.
Told you they'd come down hard for the Southwest thing.
Best @ reply I got was from a Milwaukee fan, saying Bucks should rest starters so they can win.
thought exercise: If Blazers rested their starters, how many points would they score? Could they reach double figures?
Final thought: It would be awesome to be in Orlando's cluster&amp;%&amp;$&amp; of a security line and see Tim and Manu schlepping their way thru.
If rebenga is your thing, the thing to do is announce before next season that LBJ &amp; Wade will sit out San Anto game. Buh-bye, ticket sales
BTW, Miami not exactly on moral high ground here. Sat everybody in dreadful national TV game in Boston last yr. that somebody flew up for.
Guaranteed $$. Why did they give him a qualifying offer? Is there any logical answer for this? RT @PDcavsinsider Cavs waive Luke Harangody
Incidentally, Pop did same thing in Portland a year ago. So unless you want to argue a Miami game is somehow more important, thin ice here.
Talk of fining Pop for sitting stars is ridiculous. But they should fine him for making his stars fly Southwest.
@JMcDonald_SAEN does this mean Cory Alexander is starting?
As I alluded to in my column today, the Spurs will apparently punt tonight.
@timmarchman holy ....
KG got a lot friendlier once he realized it was Gerald. RT @teamziller The second Gerald Wallace enters a fight is the second I leave it.
Apparently, the old guy Dallas really needed to sign was Jerry Stackhouse.
How you know you're in Boston, #73: when you go to a bar and end up talking to actual Irish people.
Is it too early to discuss Stackhouse's chances of winning Eastern Conference Player of the Week?
Stackhouse corner 3? Amazing. Stackhouse goaltending violation seconds later? On a ten foot rim? I'm speechless.
KG off the floor but Pierce still on it. Does he have some kind of streak we haven't heard about?
wait, what? RT @FlyerGrizBlog Tony Allen is in Kidnap That Fool mode,
Reggie Evans just flat out-hustled Pierce for that ORB. Some fans heading out with four minutes left.
Nets bring in their closer, Jerry Stackhouse.
Just when it looked like Joe was in a groove, his last shot nearly missed Massachusetts.
An optional mandatory! RT @Lockedonsports I think the officials in this game just screwed up and took an extra mandatory timeout #UTAatNOH
JT took a foul when Lee was injured. Unfortunately, Nets are in bonus. BKN now up 13 with 6:27 to go.
And now Courtney Lee is down. Celtics may need T Lue to suit up by end of this. More Hawks!
lukewarm hat-tip to Pistons, who are up 30 and have looked very much like a real basketball team last couple weeks.
Fitting that last Tweet, Celtics just saved Blatche from an illegal defense by calling timeout.
This RT @Pflanns This game is a total train wreck right now. No one's even trying to run anything. Just straight chaos ball.
Iso-Joe takes Pierce to the floor with a series of crossovers. Nets holding off Boston charge, up 11 with 7:53 left.
Lopez just came into game, exits immediately with fifth foul. Crowd finally getting into it.
Not sure what Nets are going for right now, unless it's heat checks from cold players.
Another dandy outing for Blazer bench: 42 minutes, 2-13 FG, 0 FTA, 9 fouls, 4 points.
End of 3, it's 70-55 Nets. Jerry Stackhouse is your leading scorer with 14 points. I'm being dead serious.
Amazing thing about Brooklyn's play is that Joe really hasn't looked good all year. True again tonight.
Um, guys, maybe just let Stackhouse catch and shoot from the corner.
@ESPNChiBulls missed halftime show. Will need to get @lockedonsports scouting report.
Stackhouse, the Nets' leading scorer in the first half (!), immediately hits another corner 3. Brooklynites up 17.
Four fouls on Lopez. Fascinating scrum now between Reggie Evans and Jason Collins
It's amazing how many garbage off-ball fouls Reggie Evans draws.
BREAKING: Brook Lopez with a rebound in traffic.
Let's just say Deron Williams won't be atop my All-Defense nominations. Statue-esque
Due to ejections, Nets starting Bogans and Evans at forward -- Celtics starting C. Lee, moving JT to point.
On the techs: Hump got two on that play, one for the extra foul on KG and one for the fracas with Rondo.
Consensus in media room is he'll get 1-2 games for this. Track record will work against him. Not his first visit to principal's office.
Rondo has completed 1 of the last 4 Celtics games I've been to: ejected from Gm 1 in ATL, suspended gm 2, survived Gm 5, ejected today.
Not clear to me why Boston just shot a T. Thought there were two called on each team.
Crowd applauds Rondo for mailing in first half and then getting himself ejected. Or something ....
They called a second tech on Humphries and GWallace and both are ejected. Rondo is ejected and streak ends.
As @johnschuhmann notes, Rondo may have just ended his assist streak.
With cheap-shot experts like Jason Terry and Reggie Evans in middle of mix, amazing this didn't end up worse.
Rondo wrestles Humphries behind stanchion after taking exception to Hump's extra shove on Garnett.
Avery was fuming at James Capers all the way up floor after Wallace was dispossessed. Finally earns a tech.
Nets have just completely bottled up Boston offense. Rondo overpassing, bigs fumbling, and Terry/Pierce AWOL.
TOO. MUCH. STACKHOUSE.
An iso-Joe with 12 seconds of dribbling followed by a Collins foul. I left home for this?
Hawks reunion on court. Stackhouse! Collins! Joe Johnson! Hey when's Jannero Pargo getting here?
Jason Collins in for a struggling Sullinger. Interesting.
You still think there's plan? MT @MikePradaSBN I'm not sure what this team's plan for Bradley Beal is now.
Too. Much. Stackhouse.
Since Celtics don't bother with ORBs, other 4 guys should just run back on D as soon as Barbosa gets the ball.
Of course if Wallace actually hits those spot-up 3s, then it's a different story.
Pierce isn't even leaving the lane to guard Gerald Wallace. Nets gotta figure out the spacing with Gerald-Evans-Blatche together.
Johnson gets a 3 because Rondo cherry-picking. Didn't cross halfcourt til 14 on shot clock.
Kris Humprhies getting lit. Doc got a tech protesting I don't know what but somehow it involved Rondo.
Moronic second foul on Lopez sends him to bench at 8:27 mark. Garnett was 90 feet from bucket.
Greetings from chilly Boston, where the Celtics and Nets are about to do battle. Nets won the first meeting, but Rondo didn't play.
Chatting in five minutes right here: http://t.co/Zm9QTYRn
By losing the Harvard of the B-W Parkway? Please. MT @wexlerworld ACC compromised academics in this move.
To make up for the defection of Louisville, Big East now targeting the Sacramento Kings.
Can't believe ACC traded Maryland for Louisville and didn't have to throw in draft picks or take on a bad contract.
@wolstatsun Lowry stopped guarding last year. Big reason he clashed with McHale.
Blatche should be thanking his lucky stars for Ernie Grunfled. You think somebody else was giving him $30 mil?
PBP sheet from Bucks-Bulls is amazing. Milwaukee scored 14 times in 16 trips to erase a 27-point deficit in less than eight minutes.
I'm a Greivis guy, but two words: Bath salts. RT @EricPincus Chris Paul said multiple times that Greivis Vasquez is an all-star
Knick fans: In Portland what happened tonight is known as a "Feltdown." You may wish to keep that term handy for future reference.
Up 1 with 0:10 left, Ilyasova goes back up with offensive board. Awesome.
The Felton foul took away BKN 2-for-1. Don't think it was on purpose tho.
Analysis: I'm on my couch and impacted this game more than Batum did.
Is that Charlotte-OKC score accurate? Holy regression.
I was so wrong about Singler. Fantastic first half tonight. Bargain of a contract too.
Man,  Will Barton don't give a #$@!% He's gonna take some shots.
Exciting watching Blazer bench vs Maggette-Villanueva-Monroe front line. Like immovable object vs irresistible force. But, yaknow, opposite.
Catching up to Por-Det. What a sweet full court bounce pass by Singler for Pistons' first fast-break basket since 2007.
Bout friggin time. RT @GeryWoelfel Surprise, surprise: John Henson to start for Ersan Ilyasova tonight against Bulls.
Knicks playing big with Melo at 3 tonight. Whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy
Can't figure out who should be more insulted by this. RT @DarnellMayberry Hasheem Thabeet no threat to start in front of Kendrick Perkins
@JMcDonald_SAEN Manu also got away with a blatant up-and-down violation earlier in game. Hilarity when SA announcers ignored it on replay.
Another big night for the Blazer bench I see -- 3-14, 9 points, 7 boards in 73 minutes. With 8 TOs. Yikes.
I know ... its the mentality though. RT @PokeyLokey Rondo had 10+ assists by that point...silly
Um, yes. RT @soconnor76 By interesting, do you mean things like "wait, is that still Jermaine O'Neal?" and defensive sub Sebastian Telfair?
Woke up w/ Phx-Phi. Some interesting Q4 choices by Suns. Like how Doug went small on last play &amp; switched everything.
Just finished Tor-SA. Why won't coaches ever sub in OT? How many OTs would it have taken for Raps to finally yank Bargnani?
@bruce_arthur if you had just had Nickelback sing the anthem none of this would have happened.
Have yet to see a rational explanation for why Przybilla started and played 17 minutes last night.
@haralabob  they call that the ol'  "none-for-one"
That was actually second time this week Cats fouled jump shooter at buzzer. Hack on Bargnani wasn't called.
@haralabob believe hawks led lg a year ago. That might be his reference.
Looks like my evil ploy to delay power rankings and not have Knicks #1 is working.
Lamar Odom and Andray Blatche, possibly the two least valuable players of 2011-12, are now checking each other.
Matt Barnes is throwing passes like Mark Sanchez right now.
@ZachLowe_NBA if it's Cleveland-Orlando I don't think you'll be invited back.
Stat of the day: Reggie Evans has played 1% of the league's minutes and has 40% of its flopping citations.
@ChrisVernonShow sorry my Skins couldn't keep it close enough for Romo to throw a soul-crushing pick at the end.
For Raps fans asking about refs on last play, I had Charlotte feed. But who could imagine a Malloy-Palmer-Goble crew missing calls?
Just watched Toronto-Charlotte. On Raps' last trip, Biyombo basically guarded their entire team.
What I'm thankful for, NBA writer version: DVR, TSA pre-check, arena wireless, Synergy, and coffee. Especially coffee.
@michaelgrange sooo late. This Twitter thing moves fast.
Luke Zeller checks in for Phoenix. Have the Suns ever had the good brother? Taylor Griffin, Robin Lopez, now this. Still hope for Markieff.
In same game, one Wizard ran up court on offense when actually on defense, and another ran off court celebrating when he'd actually lost.
Not sure about this Joel Freeland thing. Getting used on post-ups by a 76-year-old Jermaine O'Neal.
Catching up to Portland-Phoenix. Really digging PJ Tucker's ball denial on the wings.
SportsSouth switchboard lighting up with fans begging them to blackout 4th quarter of Hawks-Wizards.
Several viewers have confirmed original suspicion that Seraphin "JaValed". A D.C. tradition lives on.
Haven't seen a replay yet but looked like Seraphin thought Wiz had ball, started running up court, and gave Horford a dunk.
Wait did Seraphin just do a JaVale?
er, 23rd.
Major upset: PDX homecoming on 22nd apparently will be for Kevin Love, not Brandon Roy.
HAWK! RT @JMcDonald_SAEN Jason Terry jogging out of C's locker room, wearing Boston green. Will always be a Mav to me.
Watching Den-Mem from Monday. Didn't realize Nugs went Mozgov-McGee for a while. Interesting. Also, potential unintentional comedy gold.
@knicksfanblog were supposed to launch Mon. but had a tech issue. Now next Mon/Tue. 'Bockers would indeed be #1 right now.
@truehoop he never struck me as an advanced stats guy anyway.
Told by a spy that the 4-5 Lakers screen-roll from last night is called "Elbow Get"
This Bynum story just keeps getting worse. http://t.co/rtEe8daA
Finally, LOL at Avery's timeout with just over a minute left to kill a Deron transition.
Oh, and Reggie Evans will likely be first player to get a second flopping violation. D'Antoni's "phoning league" gesture was priceless.
Did notice L.A. running that Marion-Amare 4-5 pick-and-roll for Pau and Dwight. Also, Kobe looks amazing.
Just watched LAL-BKN. Only "seven seconds or less" in LA right now is Chris Duhon's battle to get ball over time line.
Rivers botched several rotations and cant shoot, but man what a fantastic hesitation move going right.
Just saw NY-NO. Why is Davis hurt every time I watch Hornets? As others noted, Melo's 1st quarter was epic.
Waiting to hear if this 138-pt guy is secretly Jordan Crawford.
News is that Nene may feel like playing tomorrow in Atlanta. Ironically, I don't feel like going.
@talkhoops Clearly he needs more touches.
Kyle O'Quinn is having himself some quality garbage time.
The Mike Scott era was brief. Hawks put starters back in as Magic cut lead to 12 against their scrubs.
Now Jones misses a dunk. This is spectacular. Earlier we saw an airballed finger-roll and a massively overbanked lay-up.
This is amazing. DeQuan Jones has tried three lay-ups and caught rim on one of them.... the bottom of it. Finally converted No. 4.
@BQRMagic Jones at least caught rim on that last one. The bottom of it, but still....
@BQRMagic that training camp of his must have been one heck of an outlier.
Mike Scott to the table! Wahoo-wa baby!
Davis makes a mid-range J! Magic up to 11 points this half. Alas, they're down 24. Drive safe everyone.
Ivan Johnson almost got an assist. I mean he was this close.
I dunno if a halfcourt shot has ever missed the basket by more than DeShawn Stevenson just did. Orlando with 8-pt Q3, Hawks up by 16.
@Hoopidea Devin Harris with a flop of the night candidate. Last min of 3rd quarter.
Harkless playing 4 against Ivan Johnson. Talk about strength mismatch.
Orlando's offense right now is a Geneva Convention violation.
Josh has The Hand now. Let's feed him for more mid-range Js.
Josh Smith drives for and-1 after scoreless first half. Of course the FT missed, but he got rim!
Please make this permanent. RT @MikePradaSBN Kevin Seraphin starts the second half for Emeka Okafor
Seriously we need a Glen Davis-Josh Smith 1-on-1 game during All-Star Weekend.
Nicholson has to help on that screen with a deadly shooter like Morrow. He'll learn.
He's only taken 21! @DimeAlert Josh Smith just airballed another free throw. That's at least his fourth on the year.
Josh airballs a free throw. Barely front-rims second. Now at 33.3% for season.
McBobs in the house, and yet no @SekouSmithNBA  . What gives?
Game within the game tonight is battle between Glen Davis and Josh Smith to be league's biggest affront to analytics community.
Not saying there are seats available, but earlier scouts were debating whether they'd be able to work lying down.
Still waiting for @MrMichaelLee to organize a Chiefs-Wizards game.
Greetings from Atlanta, where relative to Washington it's a packed house for Hawks-Magic.
we have a winner. RT @KBergCBS Atlanta. RT @I_Rep_MIA Whats worse LA traffic or South Florida traffic?
Non-NBA note: Being from New Jersey, anytime somebody mentions "Rutgers" and "TV market" in same sentence I begin laughing hysterically.
Re: that last Tweet, Saric seen by most as 1st-rounder in '13 or '14
@ESPNSteinLine The Wizzards?
@MrMichaelLee between Chiefs and Wizards, you're becoming a specialist at this sort of thing.
Yo rook -- not cool.
TOO. MUCH. JEFFRIES.
This. RT @BeckleyMason Pacers just iso'd Ian Mahinmi against Chandler, apparently on purpose.
My entertainment on Pacer post-ups: Count how long two guys are standing right next to each other.
(I'll let myself out).
That's how he rolls. RT @WindhorstESPN Sixers fear Andrew Bynum has done additional damage to his knees by bowling
kick no good b/c QB took 2-yard loss on 1st down instead of throwing incomplete pass....right?
Er, time.
Tine to yell at Mario Chalmers.
Way to get back phoenix.
Checked Twitter to see if @ZachLowe_NBA  had a comment on that block. Yep.
@rick_bonnell alas, he has no idea at all how to play defense.
Flailing RT @MikePradaSBN Really strange rotations from Wittman in this 4th quarter. No Vesely for some reason. No Crawford/Beal backcourt
Wizards come to Atlanta on Wednesday. Too early to wonder if Randy Wittman comes with them?
Boos rain down as Utah pulls away. Glass-half-full types applaud fact that OT no longer   a possibility.
Chris Singleton suddenly paroled after 43 minutes in Wittman's hoosegow. Odd.
@JMcDonald_SAEN That's the next step. 20% chance he starts wearing clogs on court.
I may favourite this Tweet RT @bruce_arthur you know you're an honourary Canadian, Hollinger.
One thing I hadn't seen coming was Emeka Okafor turning into Francisco Elson.
Martin blatantly double dribbles in opne court. Officials correct their call, even though the first one was actually correct. OK then.
Was that a Dream Shake, Mr. Seraphin?
This starting lineup not working out any better for Utah than first-half version.
If I ever write a book called "basketball's laziest inbound passes," Al Jefferson will now have an entry.
