Trump cites national security to justify threat of prolonging the shutdown for a year or longer.  Even by Trump logic, that's a hard sell when it is DHS workers he's keeping furloughed.   Shutdown ‚â† National security Caging kids ‚â† National Security Wall ‚â† National Security

@realDonaldTrump In typical gas-lighting fashion, Trump is distorting the reality that his lack of achievements, his unpopular tax cut that went to billionaires and corporations, have left him with little else but a racial dog whistle to ride into 2020.

Odd semantical hang-up by Bolton dodging the question about Khashoggi tapes... Almost like this administration is enabling a cover up.
So according to Ludlow, the President doesn't care if American consumers bear the costs of a tariff war because they can "absorb" the costs better than the Chinese in this game of chicken. Not exactly sympathetic to families living barely above water.

‚ÄúDon't tell me what you value, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.‚Äù   The GOP #TaxScam2 is another giveaway to the wealthy, blowing our deficit and sabotaging social security and Medicare. Unless you make millions, the GOP does not seem to value you.
I commend Senator Flake for taking seriously these allegations against #Kavanaugh and calling for an FBI investigation that may provide more facts before a vote is held on the Senate floor.
This is not political. If we wanted a political fight, we would've had it with Gorsuch. But Gorsuch did not have 3 credible claims of sexual assault against him. So, R's could hold up Gartland for a year, but not delay a week for the FBI to investigate? Disturbingly shameless.

Regardless of whether you believe Ford or not, Kavanaugh made several obvious lies before yesterday‚Äôs Committee, snapped at Senators and displayed a character that is antithetical to that of a Supreme Court Justice. This will irreparably harm the reputation of the SC for decades.
In the face of Ford‚Äôs credible testimony, Republicans have resorted to petulant grief about process or thin attacks on her credibility. There is a recklessly political push to disregard facts, rush a vote, and suppress the truth. Read: https://t.co/LI0EhSB1Uh  #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/MMjpr1QIBJ

On the world stage, President Trump undermines his own DOJ, his own intelligence community, and gives credence to Putin to do the same.
When asked again if he would denounce Russia's meddling in our elections, Trump again pivoted to a conspiracy theory about a 'missing' server. July 3rd, Trump's own appointed US attorney explicitly debunked this in court. He again shamelessly misleads the American people
Mr. President, you are the leader of the free world. You are the President of the United States. You do not insult your country by saying we are on par with Russia, who has attacked our elections, attacked our allies elections, and seized Crimea.
Embarassingly weak of our President to spend his entire address flattering Putin, when even Putin spoke more critically. Hope "great deal of time" Trump claimed to discuss election meddling was greater than this joint address has indicated.

Talking to adversaries is better than the alternatives to talks. However, talks must be honest and firm. Russia has undermined NATO and used military action to seize territory from our ally. Trump cannot brush these realities aside when he meets Putin. https://t.co/IXTeM21ogM
And as much as Trump would like to distort reality, citing instead a "missing" DNC server conspiracy theory, his own DOJ has disproven that false narrative in court.
In light of today's indictments, it's worth reminding that President Trump encouraged Russia to commit crimes during the election: https://t.co/TBwGKVtSVv
Speaking to @VOANews about the importance of working together with our European allies, Macedonia's invitation to NATO, and fending off Russian interference to allow Macedonians to make their own decision. https://t.co/7RrVg31As8
Trump is alarmingly indifferent about Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its military occupation in Ukraine. Normalizing relations with Putin consequently normalizes the use of military force in changing international borders. Dangerous precedent to set.

Between Trump's belligerence at the NATO summit, and the GOP's embarassing attempts to sabotage the Russia investigation during Strzok's hearing, this week has been an early Christmas for Putin. Our adversaries will happily capitalize on this discord if we do not rally. https://t.co/wtI8DsPohH
It is astounding how many of my GOP colleagues are willing to undignify themselves and their office to undermine the Russian investigation and the FBI at large. Today's marathon of a joint committee hearing is a circus.
What progress? All I see is more stall tactics by North Korea, and you take the bait every time. This is what happens when you don't put in the work for negotiations, and parade the nothingburger of a joint agreement as a "mission accomplished" https://t.co/re3f4lsX3R
..This administration will have blood on its hands for sending asylum seekers back. And not the blood of "MS-13 gang members" but the blood of women and children.  https://t.co/FWOESdaGnR

Today's passage of a House resolution reaffirming U.S. support for the NATO alliance sends an important message to our allies: Trump does not speak for all Americans. #NATOSummit
This admin is presenting a false choice when it says the only options are to separate families or detain children. Trump chose against humane alternatives, eliminating the Family Case Management Program which had a 100% compliance rate. #EndFamilyDetention
This shifting goalpost and antagonism towards our allies is unprecedented and counterproductive. Trump fundamentally misunderstands the NATO alliance. He conveniently forgets that our unity has provided peace in Europe since WW2, and that our NATO allies have bled in our wars. https://t.co/gejwrZ4UXx
Today, my bill to improve disclosures around companies with entrenched corporate governance structures passed out of committee. See my statement:   https://t.co/mQZXYjlPCw
Rule of thumb: When Trump starts a tweet blaming the last administration for something, it's usually his fault. The President's trade negotiations have been a glorified game of chicken, and the ensuing trade war is hurting Americans most. Can't pass the buck on that. https://t.co/KntOBsMZd6

Trump tried using family separation as a bargaining chip to build his wall and cut legal immigration. Now he's using separated children as a bargaining chip against parents awaiting their day in court.  This is not due process. This is not justice. This is not humane. https://t.co/9vq2gAdlFn

I‚Äôm glad the @USGAO has accepted my call to review alleged fraudulent submissions in the federal rulemaking process, including the @FCC Net Neutrality process.
The GOP‚Äôs CR leaves the statuses of DREAMers, 900 of which serve in our military, at the whim of an unreliable @WhiteHouse.
The GOP‚Äôs CR does not provide strong disaster recovery funding, including needed funds for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
The GOP‚Äôs CR contains inadequate funds for community health centers which serve vulnerable Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries.
The GOP‚Äôs CR does not make CHIP permanent, which will cost our gov‚Äôt $6 billion according to the CBO, funds that would be better served toward affordable health care.
Short-term CRs are a disastrous way of funding our gov‚Äôt; they are a disservice to our hardworking public servants and taxpayers.
Today, I voted against the @HouseGOP 's misguided continuing resolution (CR).
Does the @WhiteHouse ever accept that the @realDonaldTrump is accountable for his failure to lead? #TrumpShutdown
After months of bipartisan discussions, we know exactly the way out of this #TrumpShutdown.  The political will is not there, however, w/in the @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump should refrain from using our esteemed military men and women as political pawns, including the 900 enlisted DREAMers whose statuses are uncertain under this @WhiteHouse #TrumpShutdown
@SenatorDurbin and @LindseyGrahamSC demonstrated leadership by bringing a DACA deal to the @WhiteHouse. In an attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator, @realDonaldTrump rejected and caused this #TrumpShutdown #ArtofNoDeal #OwnIt
The @realDonaldTrump and his lack of leadership on issues of national importance (e.g., DACA), and the @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP political impotence are the true cause of this #TrumpShutdown #ArtofNoDeal #OwnIt

Let's be clear about a few things, @realDonaldTrump : 1) White supremacists aren't "fine people" 2) There aren't "many sides"
Which leads me to a sad and undeniable conclusion:  THIS PRESIDENT PEDDLES HATE
8) His speeches have been full of dogwhistles 9) And even Neo-Nazi and Alt-Right websites praised his initial #Charlottesville statement
6) One of his top advisers is an alt-right leader 7) He originally balked at the opportunity to do the bare minimum: call out Neo-Nazis!
4) His DOJ is rolling back voting rights and civil rights advancements 5) His DOJ is seeking ID of over 1 mil political dissidents
1) Trump started racist Birtherism conspiracy 2) He called Mexicans "rapists" 3) Just last night he retweeted a major alt-righter
THREAD-- President Trump displayed today what he displayed on the campaign trail and what he truly believes. Let‚Äôs not forget:
