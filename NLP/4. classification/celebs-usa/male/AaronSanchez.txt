Love Manny's energy and spirit, definitely a class act #MasterChef
Tanorria's fried chicken looked on point.  Do you think it tastes as good as it looks. She's gotta make her TN family proud! #MasterChef
Colonel Sanders ain't got nothing on Chef Gordan's fried chicken!  #MasterChef
And your three minutes starts now! #nailbiter #MasterChef
Such an amazing experience seeing all those #veterans, you really could feel the love and pride. Congrats to the blue team! #MasterChef
The last thing you want during a slammed service is plates coming back to the kitchen #MasterChef #nobueno
@Starlilies68 @MASTERCHEFonFOX  seasoned with S&amp;P, grilled + served w chimichurri + fire roasted vegetables, yum!  #Masterchef
What would you guys do with a beautiful protein like hanger steak? #MasterChef
@MorganAlvarado Thanks, Morgan!  That means a lot!
It was so funny watching the competitors split into two groups. Come on guys, y'all have done harder things in this competition! #MasterChef
It was pretty epic flying in that plane with @GordonRamsay #MasterChef
Excited to be back as a guest judge + so honored to be on this episode of #MasterChef!
@GordonRamsay I've been lucky to work w so many amazing chefs, it's hard to pick just 1. Don't worry though, you make my top 5! #Masterchef

@lkassaf nothing beats an gooey salted caramel parfait #MasterChef
@Loris883 - corn masa, it‚Äôs more traditional. I like flour tortillas with carne asada and barbacoa, corn for everything else #masterchef
@wynn2go I like to make pig ears and lots of seafood. A pitcher of drinks and savory crepes. Barbacoa and whole grilled fish. #MasterChef
@emoorecakery @MASTERCHEFonFOX Palates are cleansed with sparkling water. There is also a break between everything. #MasterChef
@xinyu_g Pork because of it's versatility. It can take on a lot of different flavors with seasoning. Braised, smoked, it's always good!
@gabryBoschetto Check out Tiki's, as an El Paso native it's my favorite. I want to retire there someday and go back to my roots. #MasterChef
@Pyllek They either don't season properly or they don't heat their pans properly, it's too hot or too cold. #MasterChef
@830Chef  Lay it flat on the cutting board and make sure you have a sharp knife. #MasterChef

@goodgriefcooks Hmmm... Tell me more
Rhubarb is a very tough ingredient for pie. When done right it's delicious, but easy to mess up. #MasterChef @MASTERCHEFonFOX
@cruxcorona Love it my brother
Terry's blueberry pie is perfection. Pretty damn good for a handyman! #MasterChef

Tanorria showing some swag and strategic gameplay. Long road ahead. We'll see how it plays out. #MasterChef
@MrsMcGonagill Respect
@cruxcorona Fusion creates confusion. But I do apprecite how traditional flavors + ingredients can be adapted to create new dishes.
@TremontRhino Can't go wrong with a good key lime
@Boudleaux Love Chess pie. #whodat
If you had to make one pie to avoid elimination, what kind would you make? I'd probably go with banana cream. #MasterChef
The 3 P's... pies, pudding and puffs! #MasterChef
All 3 were delicious dishes, but one really stood out and won the advantage in the next challenge. #MasterChef
So who do you think deserves to win this challenge? #MasterChef
@diagonnAllly Thanks!  I love being part of it.
Tanorria knows how to get a Mexican chef excited... poblano creamed corn makes me happy. #MasterChef @MASTERCHEFonFOX
@TrueRoyalDM4 Love it!
Alejandro is making arepas, Venezuela's daily masa bread filled with different fillings and one of my favorite dishes. #MasterChef
@DanielleRene_90 I'd love to see that. Two of the best.
What do y'all think about the #MCMysterBox ingredients?  What would you make? #MasterChef

Awesome game. Cavs + Warriors left it all on the court in first 2 games. Going to be closer series than most predicted. #Lovethisgame @NBA
@michaeltranson What about the foul by Draymond on the jump ball?
@TimWenz @KingJames What about the one on the jump ball?
@jamelle147 @KingJames Ok what about the one on the jump ball?
That no call on @KingJames might have cost Cavs the game. Foul couldn't have been clearer. #NBAFinals
@loflier You're asking a @nyknicks fan so if we knew the answer he'd still be a Knick!
LeBron 0 undisputed best player in the NBA - Cavs up by 2 with under 30 seconds to play. Iman Shumpert takes a 3? Don't get it. #NBAFinals
If Warriors win, J.R. Smith has to be considered as their MVP.  Dude made 2 inexcusable plays in last 2 minutes. #NBAFinals
Terrible foul by J.R. Smith. Kind of play that costs you close games. Curry heating up for las few minutes. Coming down to wire. #NBAFinals
@UcCaliChic25 No doubt!  Dude has ice in his veins.
LeBron missing free throws, but hitting monster 3's when they need 'em. #NBAFinals
Let me take this commercial break to say... FIRED UP for Straight Outta Compton #NWA #EasyE
Big time step back and shot by @KingJames. #NBAFinals
@JBthegiant no doubt Cavs are playing intense D and slowing them down.
The Big Russian playing lights out. I don't see Warriors staying this cold in the 4th. #NBAFinals
Crafty veteran James Jones stepping up. Cavs need someone to hit shots and take some pressure off LeBron. #NBAFinals
@NCOrangeMan thanks brother!
@CaptPat48 touch√©!
Fast pace definitely not favoring Cavs. They need to slow it down + try to make Warriors play half court offense to have a shot. #NBAFinals
@NCOrangeMan @NBA Don't have a dog in the fight so just want a great game, but hard not to like Warriors in this 1. But never count out LBJ.
Well THAT was AWESOME. @SantanaCarlos and @drumstress just crushed the National Anthem! #NBAFinals #PRS @NBA
