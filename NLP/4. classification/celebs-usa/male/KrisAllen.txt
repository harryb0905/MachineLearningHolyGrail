@JohnnyRuffo Nice! Yeh try amazon. I don‚Äôt know why it wouldn‚Äôt be available.
@michellebourey It‚Äôs an incredibly hard issue. But it doesn‚Äôt seem that the weight of the issue is what‚Äôs keeping it from moving forward and changing.
@brandonm227 Why has this particular gun (or ones close in detail) been used in so many mass shootings then? Does a .22 have a semiautomatic function? I‚Äôm really just asking. Other than the 12 gauge I had when I was a kid, I don‚Äôt know a lot about guns.
@dy7764 It‚Äôs definitely not an easy issue. I get that. But I just would love to see action in the right direction. I‚Äôm afraid we are moving backwards. What I‚Äôm more afraid of is that there is money making these decisions.
Obviously the desire to kill is a mental problem, but the legal access to this caliber of a gun is a policy problem. Do something. Everything I‚Äôm saying feels like common sense to me but if we don‚Äôt say it then obviously it won‚Äôt change.
@ShepNewsTeam ‚ÄúWe are failing our children.‚Äù That is all any politician should need to hear. Gun policies have to change or this will keep happening. Let‚Äôs stop blaming it on other problems.
@dinahhmite This is not just a hot button issue. This is a major major problem. One that could be changed. Humans have become who we are because we have seen problems and changed them. Why aren‚Äôt we learning? Is it greed? Ignorance?
@dinahhmite I believe in the power of prayer. And I hope that the people that are saying this are actually praying for the families and people that were affected by this tragedy. We should pray about gun policies. That they would be changed effectively. But work needs to be done as well.
@RunInRedSox Thanks for the info
There is so much I don‚Äôt understand. Did this teenager pass the FBI background check to buy this gun? And why did the family let him have access to it? Why didn‚Äôt anyone try to help this kid?
