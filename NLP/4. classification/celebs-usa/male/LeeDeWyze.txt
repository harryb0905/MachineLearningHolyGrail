@natjies For the IPhone?
Can someone explain to me why there is still not a way to share your phone battery?   If you plug into my phone,  my phone then becomes an external charger for your phone. C’mon 2019, you can do it.  #ShareThePower

..clothes, and supplies. They’re working their asses off to fight these crazy fires! Thanks to all who helped make it possible, and remember it doesn’t take much to help!! Here’s a few photos from the help centers we dropped off at...
Thanks to all the donations from @CentinelaFeed in Encino, CA and #BigAlsFeed in Simi Valley, CA , along with the donations from our families and friends... @jonnawalsh , and I, with everyone’s help were able to provide so many families, first responders , and animals with food..
...I know, it may sound like a pipe dream. I’m simply saying it doesn’t hurt to try our best.
you turn. Hopefully we’re not so far gone that having compassion and empathy are things of the past.  There are still a lot of good people out there. Let’s all do try to do our part in adding to the good, and helping and supporting the people in need..
Peoples lives are being burned down. Animals are getting trapped and dying. Roads are jammed with people having to evacuate. This all coming days after a senseless shooting that left many lives in ruin. Not to mention the daily toxicity that exists in every single direction...

I am mentally exhausted.                                            .                                           .                                          .
...and standing for what you believe in? And standing and stepping on the pain and emotions of others experiences and beliefs simply because you feel you’ve “won”. I don’t usually talk about these things because I don’t like adding to toxicity. I just feel compelled today.
With all that’s going on in the current climate...In my opinion... there’s no reason for people to be advocating or enjoying the pain and or the emotions of people who don’t agree with you. There’s a vast difference between having beliefs...

I propose that there be a 3 day weekend. It will be Saturday, Sunday, &amp; Funday. I know this sounds stupid, but it also doesn’t if you really think about it
I wish @Twitter would change the question from “What’s Happening” to something else once in a while. I could list alternates but you get the idea.
Dogs are so appreciative and grateful of their food. They essentially eat the same thing everyday, and they’re always so happy about it.
Have you ever had a moment where you felt both over AND underwhelmed?
It’s interesting to live in a time when everyone knows everything about every subject at all times.

I have tried many of the previously mentioned methods. Unfortunately, nothing is working. So back to the Dr tomorrow. It’s hard to sing with a cough. It’s also hard to sleep. Basically, coughing makes most activities more difficult.
Thanks for the suggestions. Trial and error I suppose. I’ll keep at it, it’s just so annoying!!!!
Cough meds not workin, cough drops, no...anyone have advice for a “tickle in throat/chest” type annoying cough?  #AnnoyingAF

Today we remember the brave women and men, their families, and the service animals who have served and sacrificed for our freedom. Thank You. #MemorialDay
.. and the support from the people around me that has allowed me the space I need to continue to push myself creatively. To all of you, thank you. Here’s to whatever the future holds, to the next song, the next record, the next tour, the next story, You guys kick ass.  #ThankYou
..I will always remember and appreciate the amount of support from my family and friends that encouraged me &amp; pushed me through that very crazy and unpredictable time in my life. It’s the understanding and support from my manager Brett..
...the highs and lows, the sacrifices, tour after tour, song after song that has impacted me the most. It was because of my time on Idol that I  was lucky enough to meet the love of my life in my wife Jonna, and allowed our paths to cross. My wife’s  support has been everything..
For any artist, it’s the fans, the passion for music, and the listeners of our music that drives and allows us to keep creating. For that, I can’t thank you enough. My time on the show allowed me a platform, but beyond that.. it’s the countless memories and experiences...
My passion for songwriting, and connecting with all of you has always been at the forefront. Whether you watched me on the show, or just heard my music for the first time, your support has not and will not ever go unnoticed or unappreciated..
8 years ago today, I won American Idol. I went on the show because of my passion for music. I wanted to be able to perform, and write songs and share my stories through songwriting. For the past 8 years I’ve been able to do just that...
Having a listen to #Paranoia on vinyl for the first time was an awesome experience. Get yours HERE 👉🏼👇🏼 https://t.co/i6CLf5Nvuq #Paranoia #Enjoy @notrendrecords https://t.co/Ipc2huvNGz

it’s not because I’m watching Netflix. Because I can’t. Because I have no internet. Now please excuse me, I have news to watch. Yours Truly, Leon James D.  PS @ATT  Please Send Internet.
...I’ve tried the reset, I’ve performed the ancient router dance of a thousand truths. Nothing..Customer service has abandoned me. I have been promised internet by the 9th day of the 3rd month of the Gregorian calendar. If you don’t hear from me again...
Day 3. Still no sign of internet. The electronic devices have started power down. We’ve returned to standard television, everything seems so...blurry. It’s as if the red blinking light on the router knows what it’s doing, mocking me every blink....
Wtf you doing? That truly saddens me &amp; pisses me off....I’m sure your family will be thrilled. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/0YxEqIbPoq

Thanks everyone. That was fun. Let's talk again real soon :) #Paranoia
"Through the darnkness see the light, empty spaces want to fill your mind.. oh they fill your mind...." https://t.co/kEqlPimqLM
Yes https://t.co/m1OhYZvVMR
I'd say the biggest challenge in making "Paranoia", was hitting those moments of "is that something I would do..." and then when the answer is no, deciding to do it. Im glad I did. I believe I tapped into parts of my my writing that were untapped, that was also the best part https://t.co/MNecjvLI4O
Thanks!! Yeah they are close, but we're okay. Hoping everyone affected is okay and safe. https://t.co/3b74YaajQG
Yes actually, To be more specific.I was thinking about the record..And what people will think when they hear it, and then I looked over, and he was leaning. It was distracting, but didn't erase the more important train of thought. And I suppose "bored" can be replaced with tired https://t.co/eqDcBaSuGe
Unlike the others https://t.co/IXSWMTi5rJ
I hope you all enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed making!! https://t.co/f3DksAaUvg
Yes https://t.co/CRnw8qAbUY
Ten https://t.co/6ZBqTLoPCY
Picking a favorite on this one will be very difficult. Perhaps more so than any album I've ever released...I'll probably talk more about that once it's out...gotta think that one over. Good question!! https://t.co/s8tBhduyda
Yes https://t.co/2wLtvh5iup
I'm down for answering a few questions about the record if you want to ask any, or anything you want to ask for that matter...
D....the answer is D  I am deep in thought, but that's always....and I do get "bored" before I play, usually anxious energy that somehow turns to being tired, and there was a guy leaning on my car..he has moved on to other bigger and better cars..but the lean remains strong.
A) Deep in thought.. B) Watching a guy lean on my car which is making me very happy.. C) I'm bored.. D) All of the above https://t.co/t0lkl2G2go

More specifically: When Kevin plays the TV, and makes the pizza delivery guy think he's getting shot at by a mobster in "Home Alone"... he runs off terrified and he just... went back to work??
Why didn't the pizza delivery boy in Home Alone call the police?

conservation efforts. So, I'm supposed to believe @realDonaldTrump who thinks climate change is a hoax, suddenly cares about the conservation of our planet? And part of his solution is make it more enticing for to kill endangered species? Right. At least his kids will be happy..
There is 0 reason to encourage hunting endangered species on this planet. Why make it easier for poachers? It's so obviously self interest (see family photos of killing elephants and other big game) driving this lifted ban. Disappointing and extremely sad. Tell me it's helping..
To all the heroes who are serving and have served this country, Thank You. #HappyVeteransDay 🇺🇸

There's no conspiracy. Being anti-hate, is not an agenda. I do not support anyone who has a foot on both sides of this picket line.
Why people feel what they feel? Is it that hard? Really? You don't get why people are upset? And pissed? And hurt? and angry?
It is baffling to me the amount of justification, excuses, and counter reasoning that is going on. Why is it so hard for these people to see

Here is their number. I DO NOT want their money. But you guys should get a refund In my opinion. He just pocketed your money (603) 819-9336
You're the best :) Here is a link their Facebook page. Just be aware of these guys.   https://t.co/PAMcaEwhUk  :)
Is how this venue operates. I don't want to see that happen to anyone else. I had a great time that night, and thanks to all who came out..
They just, didn't pay me, &amp; refuse to respond... I'm not worried about getting paid, I just want fans and bands to be aware that this...
I played a show there, and they have refused to pay me. Yes. They just didn't pay me. After taking in money for tickets, and Meet and Greets

I'm reaching for the door, goodbye my friends..the next you hear from me I shall hopefully be in the company of Bagels and Donuts.. #FearNot
With only a blanket and very little will power, I am getting out of the bed. There's no turning back now...
Need food, need coffee..the great Remy monster awaits me. He is strong and powerful, he will make me run around with him.
I'm now sitting up, fully swaddled. I can do this.
Attempt 1 getting out of bed has failed. The room is chilly. I will need extra covering to make this journey...
Well if these were your two options, which would you pick?
That truly is a great question. https://t.co/OqaMfdBWjX

And don't tell someone how to walk In shoes your feet will never fill.
Don't preach forgiveness if you can't forgive.Don't preach acceptance if you can't be yourself.Don't expect to be heard if you can't listen
"You're the enemy, and anything I say, post, tweet, can be as hateful as I want..because I'm just so right"
EXAMPLE: "I believe XYZ, so therefor everything I say is right, and everything I support is right. And im right. You don't agree?...then.."
So sick of people hiding behind their beliefs whatever they are as a shield to be hateful, &amp; "right" . I've never seen more hypocrisy...

Kinda messed up when the political headlines in mainstream news are worse than the Nat Enq headlines.
It's hard for me to say which is my favorite... right now? I'd say the classic Halloween. Such a good one. Nightmare Before is also classic.

Sorry, just stop putting raisins in trail mix. It's just the worst

Raisins are just old people grapes. #RaisinRant
Raisins are the boogers of the fruit world #RaisinRant
Raisins are just grapes that wandered into the desert and died

My favorite part about it? Is that is gives some people who have no guts in the real world a place to build up their self esteem and ego.
I love the Internet.
Ok, I'll make my next record just for you. Because that's why I make music. So Daniel Campos won't hate it. Lolol https://t.co/OI1EseTN0b
That's how I feel about the song I'm writing right now. Good news is, there will be more dinners.
You know when you make a dinner. And you're stuffed, and your like "shit I forgot the baked potatoes" and you wish you didn't fill up...
Very sad and maddening what happened in Brussels. My heart goes out to all of those people, their families, and the city. Very sad.

Everyone else at the dog park is not your dog sitter. It's a place to let your dog get exercise &amp; play. Not let them off leash, &amp; walk away.
Attention people at the dog park. It is not a place to go, let your dog run off while you text and make calls and ignore your dog.

@RaceAvery_ LOL
@ashwee427 the most "challenging" part I guess. Is second guessing. Wondering is this really "done"? That's the worst part for me at least
@JennMHarding I think that moment when what you envision comes to life through the creating process and you sit back. And you experience it
@sublymonal yes yes and yes
@stephhh1124 I guess I would describe it as me. Very very me. Which I guess means I just did what I wanted to do. If that makes sense. Lol
@Kaeleeiscool chill for sure
@MattDamonsno1fa honestly? The "winners" always kind of stand out. You just. Know I guess.
@laurel005 I am very excited. Been working on this for a LONG time now. Will feel so good to put out new music :)
@palatineleefan well. The album is basically "done". :)

Regardless of who they are, or what YOU might think, treating people with respect. It's honestly not that difficult
And I'm not talking about freedoms. I'm not talking about people's right to believe what they want. I'm talking about treating people..
Sorry, but I just saw something really Terrible at a coffee shop by my house. And it made me sick.
Breathing thing. When people realize that we are literally all on this earth together, maybe things can change.
We are on this earth for a very short time. Spend it wisely, because honestly? When people start to look at the earth itself as a living..
Is it that fucking hard to accept someone who is different than you? Honestly. Black, white, gay, straight, trans, it doesn't matter..
Nobody is born a racist. Nobody is born with prejudice. It is taught, and learned. You have a brain. use it. I can not stand intolerance.

Spread my music over the years. I truly see where I'm at now in my career, as the tip of the iceberg if you will, just the beginning...
Well, five years ago today I won @AmericanIdol . I just want to thank all of you for your continued support, love, and for helping....

Sometimes when I'm writing a song, I start thinking about whether I'm writing it, or the song exists, and I'm just finding it.
What's the word
So thanks for letting me talk to all of you, and maybe I can post something soon. ;)
Thanks for all you do. Now? I have to finish this song I started, or else it will not exist, and that would kill me.
In the works :) in fact, something cool coming soon. And can't wait to share with all of you.
To keep me inspired. I am blessed and grateful to do what I love. When I'm quiet on here at times, just know? It's because I have something
I will always be out there, playing, performing, and of course writing... Until my body won't let me. So thank you for all you do..
Includes you. So thanks for coming along on this thing with me over the last few years. Just so you know...
I do this because I think it's important, to keep in touch with all of you. You really are inspiring, and every step of this process..

Something different, something special. So we decided to make this video. We wanted to do something that hasn't been done before like this..
My friend and I, made a music video ourselves. In an ever competitive, and quickly changing industry, we wanted to make something new...
