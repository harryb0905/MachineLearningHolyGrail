Black ops.
@kirtibhargav1 @IGN im glad someone got that
@MandyGomez01 It's a movie called the FP. Look it up one of my favorites
@neenanuh @followoller I think you should make a side by side example to state your case
@IGN probably yelling at lilly tomlin too much
Had way too much fun last night at X-Men premier that I didn't know was happening until an hour before.
Rammstein has officially changed my life. I'm speechless. Once I gather my thoughts I'll have more to say
I think combichrist is opening for rammstein. This is going to be insane.
@xxMaikexxx danke. Ich denke, dass ich sie heute abend treffen werde.
@DestinAsian favorite band of my younger years. They never come to america because they're too cool so kinda once in a lifetime chance.
@daphnetaekema @kyralovesjonas oops. Happy belated birthday.

Modern warfare 3. This November!
@MandyGomez01  then we get the rest based on what we raised, this just helps us get it done faster.

@DestinAsian How you doin' man? I'm sure Bali is gorgeous right now. Have fun at the party!
#ispendwaytomuchmoneyon is a trending topic but i don't understand how it got to that amount of popularity when "too" is spelled wrong.

@BuffayBu Wow all the way from China. don't even worry just knowing that surprises me thanks for the support.
@georgelewiss Oh yeah from anywhere!
@georgelewiss To preproduction mostly. Location scouts, getting the rest of the money depending on how much we raise, and gifts to donators.
so there's an MLK quote going around having relevance to the recent Osama situation, that I'm pretty sure MLK didn't actually say...
@Lunsfuhd hows that trailer coming man?

@christinebrasil thanks!
@watchingusfade hahaha nuff said

@LuceLangley Nice i Like the enthusiasm!
@JoyCyrus Leider nicht bald...
@fefelemos what's wrong with a five dollar? any bit helps
@watchingusfade Ha so was I. sadly i would only get a few cents and it may or may not go from my pocket and into the movie were making
@LuceLangley under each tier you click the "claim this" link and it will take you to the next page.
@watchingusfade hahaha man that's a serious request, maybe some of my colleagues might be willing to consider.

@xTamzy well then here you go
@LuceLangley That's the goal
@WzraTv Thanks for the support!
@28Annie We could turn it around pretty quick, but that's assuming we get started ASAP, and that's where I need your help.
@MandyGomez01 Depends on how fast we get help. and the vid should explain most of your questions
@captainflick I love that you've seen that movie
@BeckerszMusic That's the spirit
@mandydornelas I would consider it. If you were to check out the link...
Fast five is THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR. SO FAR.

@Emily_Loves_You yeah that was a fun one
@aintitcool one of my favorite sites
The new captain america reminds me of the phantom with Billy Zane in the best way possible. I can't wait. Watch the special trailer at....
@SappingtonLaton I know I can't wait but must admit 1 1/2 mass effects in four days has rendered me burnt out. Fallout new Vegas anyone?
just when i thought diving into mass effect was the best thing that has happened to me in weeks, I met Mass Effect 2...
One of the coolest games I have ever played. Deserving of much praise may go on the list with FFVII and Fallout 3. I can't stop playing.
After hearing too much about it and winning bafta's best game award, I had to check out the mass effect series and I must say....
Be sure to check out the season premiere of #gigantic with my boy @FollowOller on Teen Nick tonight at 930p et.

Oh walmart how I have missed your gigantic power.....
After she replies a simple "yes" he then proceeds to name close to a dozen European countries he has been to. He's forgiven, he's a marine.
On a flight, Norwegian girl asks American guy, "Have you ever been to Europe?" "Uhh, no. Oh wait, does germany count?"
Playing Red Dead Redemption with @FollowOller while iChatting with @dericlee. Technology is too much sometimes.

At the midnight showing of MacGruber!
Can't wait to go buy red dead redemption, just like @FollowOller
Airlines will do him a "favor" and pay for half of his hotel and none of his transportation. American airlines sure is patriotic.
Tell the soldier, that even though he will have to wait another day for a flight which was not his fault by any means for missing American..
Baghdad for an 11 month tour has been trying to get to his unit since Wednesday. Along with my frustration, I listen to the attendant...
So an imaginary storm that never happened keeps us from landing which makes me miss my flight home. An american soldier who has been in...
@paulaalvim ok since you called me out here I am answering my fans
If my over 82000 followers never listen to me but one time, listen to this. NEVER fly out of the Dallas airport. EVER!
@WzraTv oh yeah I've had chik fila three times since I've been back. And I've only been here 3 days.
@JoyCyrus welches Lied? Ich kenne sie alle.
Just finished my pulled pork sandwich at sonny's BBQ. It's been too long...

Watching Rob Dyrdeks Fantasy Factory. I want a Sidehack so bad.

@Team_Knight Fair enough, I haven't really been posting many things on it, I should get on that soon.
Great working with @mitchellphoto. getting ready to start
The new trailer for the Expendables is out! If you read this, you're a male, and don't watch it, you're not a real man.
Leaving Paris tomorrow. Sucks, I have been having way too much fun.
I'm not done packing and I leave for Paris in 4 hours.
@AllieJDee Someone told me it would be a good idea to tweet you, @KyleKaplan
Viggo Mortensen didn't even get nominated for an oscar for The Road. I do not even want to pursue acting anymore.
You can't beat blindfiring an AK47 at a truck you're running away from in Nepal, Crash Bandicoot style. Phenomenal.
Uncharted 2. Best movie I have ever played. I didn't mistype that, I meant every word.
Thanks to mother nature, im stuck another night. the car was almost there. Sucks.
thought i was going to make it to LA today, then i looked outside and saw that it was still snowing. Goodfellas and Crank 2 only go so far.
I'm tallying the days snowed in. Day II. Hopefully gonna do some mountain sledding and Crank 2 viewing soon.
I'm actually snowed in the mountains now and cant leave. No cell phone service so twitter is better for communicating this with my family ha
i dont normally post things like this but this interview is a pretty accurate portrait of me
check this out http://www.teenhollywood.com/2010/01/12/hot-lucas-till-spy-next-door-interview
@justjaredjr one last thing i just posted a pic of me on set of battle LA as my profile pic. me as a marine! thanks for talking.
@justjaredjr probably the soundtrack to a video game from when i was younger that i played called Final Fantasy VII.
@justjaredjr also my dad is in the military so it was a little close to heart.
@justjaredjr it was awesome. i love playing new things a this was definitely one of those cooler roles.
@justjaredjr when i get enough land i will definitely have a horse of my own, actually a bunch of my own.
@justjaredjr yes. i went with my dad in the mountains AND i just noticed that the boots i am wearing right now are the ones from the movieha
@justjaredjr i took 4 years of jiujitsu through high school so i have had my share of it and i may take more in the future for a role.
@justjaredjr honestly i couldnt tell you, it changed so many times and it took a week for the restaraunt scene including rehearsal.
@justjaredjr definitely the first one. Fun dialogue, speaking russian, knife fighting with jackie chan, and going through a glass window.
@justjaredjr always wanted to be like mel gibson in braveheart
@justjaredjr i play too many games. ha. i definitely think i would like to have a scottish accent in a role soon.
@justjaredjr i played a lot of Grand Theft Auto 4 to get the accent down and i love accent roles and would like to do more in the future.
@justjaredjr also no miley cyrus kisses so that was different as well
@justjaredjr it was a lot faster, most of my scenes were action scenes, so camera setups didnt take as long and there werent many breaks
yeah how to get my butt kicked by a living legend. that was the most important one. hehe
Hi! It was seriously a dream come true. I used to idolize him all throughout my younger years.
