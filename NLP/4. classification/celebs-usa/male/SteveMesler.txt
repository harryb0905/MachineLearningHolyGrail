A1 - chasing the toddler, running from the toddler, and getting a good morning workout in. Making sure I get my workout in is key to keeping my thoughts clear and my focus on point! #ClassroomChampions
A4: My wishes for education: 1. The edu system would ensure all kids equal access - to knowledge, role models, supports, etc. 2. We could better connect outside of school to inside the 4 walls. 3. Teachers were paid like doctors - it IS life or death. #ClassroomChampions
A3:That's an easy one around #ClassroomChampions - we like to encourage participating classrooms to share with their CC athlete mentor... finding someone outside their normal circle sometimes creates some big engagement. #ClassroomChampions
@ClassroomChamps A2: I like to connect with students on what sports they're interested in before getting into the sports that I'm interested in, or was successful in... finding a shared place of passion with kids helps make that connection come to life. #ClassroomChampions
@yenneam Haha, awesome!
Steve here, currently in the air from Calgary to San Fran... I'm the founder of #ClassroomChampions and used to side down mountains in tights for a living!

@erinhamlin @olympicchannel Still so amazing that that happened!!
@onepeloton just wanted to pop in to say thanks. This 40 year old former run-for-5-second-and-sit athlete can't say enough good things about you and what you've done for my workouts.  That's all.
Thank you for the ongoing support! https://t.co/PtVyDFFWUY
It's humbling to stop, reflect &amp; take account of sustained greatness, especially when it's in something you're wired to despise.  Everyone should try it some day. To appreciate something amazing even when it goes against the fabric of your being is a sobering exercise. #SuperBowl https://t.co/mXhrGqJh8e

Looking forward to what you all have to say on this one! #teachers  Q3: In what ways are you tying tying Outdoor Education to student achievement? #ClassroomChampions
A1: I'm a bit biased and will defer to all of our experts out there on this one.. but, to put my bias out there, here's my outdoor education preference. :-) Q1: How would you describe Outdoor Education? What are your favorite Outdoor Education activities? #ClassroomChampions https://t.co/wR7GdxO3Q6
Hey #ClassroomChampions chat folks! Steve here - I'm the co-founder of @ClassroomChamps and am PUMPED @RobynThiessen is our moderator tonight... another one of those "best teachers out there" people. Go, Robyn, go! (she's third from the left in this pic w/ her #sd36learn crew)

@MarkWarner @arotherham Can you please just post this every morning. You know, as a reminder. Thank you.
@manny_ottawa Yeah, that, and or not bow down Communist demands that affect our democracy. Because I'm sure Canada "listening" to China would stop them from doing ridiculous things and making more ridiculous requests.
@AdrianAdams_USA Keep doing your thing brother!
@RobynThiessen Whoomp whoomp!!!

"Ask"  (you don't get what you don't ask for) #ClassroomChampions  Q4: Many people pick one word to help drive their focus throughout the year; what is one word that will help you focus on making 2019 your best year yet?
A3: Personally, it's going to be a big workout year, so I'm pumped to get into the best shape I've been in since 2010! Professionally, working w/ districts across the US and Canada to bring more athletes as mentors and support for their Ts is going to be HUGE! #ClassroomChampions
A1: We really grew @ClassroomChamps a lot this year - and going through the process of making sure we had great people on our team to support our Ts across the continent as really a huge learning opp for us...  #ClassroomChampions
@smccarthy3rd @ClassroomChamps It's tough work but someone had to do it. :)

These guys volunteer as mentors for @ClassroomChamps in WNY schools. 300 lucky students are getting to learn from them this year. #community #impact https://t.co/FkDQzfanpP

#ClassroomChampions - thanks so much everyone for hanging out tonight - was awesome to see what you all had to say!!!
A4 that's an easy one - #ClassroomChampions! https://t.co/3YZZOGlqWF https://t.co/wHBde2eZVF
A3 This is a big one - what do you all have for this?  #ClassroomChampions Q3: If you could change THREE things about education, what would they be? #ClassroomChampions  @usedgov @educationcanada  feel free to listen in... https://t.co/Qj6UL4hG2o
A2 Goooooo! (I'm sitting here, not so secretly hoping that for you CC T's out there, that @ClassroomChamps is one of those ways!) #ClassroomChampions But, what else??? https://t.co/P6qKAzajwy
A1 I remember, for me when I was student teaching back in 2000 in Gainesville, FL, it was doing my best to work w/the students who appeared to not want to be there. Finding ways to get them engaged was tough as a young T back then. #ClassroomChampions
A1 Really interested to hear folks response to this one - this is where our team gets a lot of info about how they can better support teachers to connect with their mentors... #ClassroomChampions #mentorship #SEL
Hey @ClassroomChamps educator fans - who's joining in for tonight's #ClassroomChampions #twitter chat? I'll be on from 8:30-9pm ET #edchat
That's what I'm talkin'bout Gators!!! #comeback @FloridaGators
@StuartMcMillan1 @LaurynCwilliams I know right?
@StuartMcMillan1 @LaurynCwilliams that was a good dad joke, dude. I'm all in on my dad jokes nowadays.
Yeahhhh, that @LaurynCwilliams is a smart cookie, (***bun intended***)  @StuartMcMillan1 https://t.co/vKExTBf7sk

@sabharwals Love that idea!
Imagine what you would have learned having the best athletes in the world teaching your classroom about teamwork, goal setting, &amp; leadership all year long! @ClassroomChamps is off to a big start mentoring in schools &amp; districts across the continent... https://t.co/PHnGWnnRgZ https://t.co/hlGzDakLjP

Love seeing this one... https://t.co/BrUbcUoPRs
A4 - First 2 CC teachers to reach out to your EdCo - I'll personally hop on with you this week or next to head to YOUR classroom! #classroomchampions
#Classroomchampions totally forgot to intro myself! Along with my sister, I founded @ClassroomChamps back when my main job was to run real fast for five seconds and sit for a minute... Wearing tights. @USABS thanks everyone for taking part!
A2 - interested to hear what everyone has to say on this one... we're always looking for ways to spread the impact of the athletes that are donating their time and experiences to our classrooms - and want to find ways to amplify for you all! #classroomchampions
A3 - Goooo!! :-) #classroomchampions - I'm also curious - for those of you not in CC, how could having a mentor like this help you?
#Classroomchampions https://t.co/2pO6IEYxN8
A1 - at @ClassroomChamps we're thinking about how we can help teachers bridge the school-home gap. We're asking a lot of questions about how we either help teachers get info home, or if we should be digitally getting info there through the non-profit... thoughts?
@mr_Alsheimer @RACzyz @JeremyDarlow @SteeleThoughts @brewerhm @MrsAlsheimer @bethhill2829 @MrsHankinsClass @NowakRo @MrCoachEli *after, not arrive!
@mr_Alsheimer @RACzyz @JeremyDarlow @SteeleThoughts @brewerhm @MrsAlsheimer @bethhill2829 @MrsHankinsClass @NowakRo @MrCoachEli Totally agree - I look at our work and systems to support students, teachers, and families with a whole new lens arrive becoming a father. Keep up the great work!

This is Malcolm. He repped @classroomchamps all summer &amp; today helped award 2x champ, @ScottMccarron, his trophy!  This weekend's @ShawClassic @ChampionsTour will raise $10,000,000 for youth across the region &amp; we're honored for CC to once again be a featured charity!  Yahoooo! https://t.co/J15mZmmN34
That's what I'm talkin'bout #Gators! 53-6 is not a shabby way to start the year! https://t.co/LFUL0Kz0mh
@rossdroy @ClassroomChamps Keep an eye out for Kirk Triplett - we played in the Pro Am with him on Thursday and taught him most things you'll see out there today. (Or... Something like that)
@TeacherPoff @ClassroomChamps Ha, that was literally me this morning getting work done for the same reason!
When I still felt really good about my golf game! https://t.co/NRawbIOesy
The @ShawClassic is on it's way to raising $10,000,000 for kids charities in Alberta. If you want to have your donation matched up to 50% for @ClassroomChamps and/or 180 other charities in the #Calgary area, there's only one day left... thank you to all who have given already! https://t.co/PpPBxk0VnA
@TeacherPoff @ClassroomChamps @breakoutEDU Welcome to the team, Matt! Pumped to see what you and your Ss are going to get done this year! @catwittman5 @MrsPereira_Gr_1 @anjoli_santiago
I mean, I'm never a fan of @ClassroomChamps being the reason for someone to work on a Friday night, BUT............ #BetterGetsBetter #MentorReveal https://t.co/7XI7bXXw9E
Having a fundamental problem w/all the initiatives teaching kids what 'not' to do. Teaching kids, as the fundamental, to not bully each other, or shred hate, seems counter-intuitive to all other methods of coaching. Let's encourage them to DO things, not NOT do things.
@MrsCouchBMP @ClassroomChamps @BrenMarPark_ES Can we have the high res version of that pretty please? :) @catwittman5
Oh man, that's awesome... https://t.co/uwdgClPRD8

@KimPegula Thanks for posting that, Kim. Means a lot to the Olympic family. He will be missed.
@asimon0215 This is great... thanks for sharing it. It states it perfectly...
Couldn't agree more. I see SEL as something separate in so many places across the US as if it's a nice-to-have 'thing' but not as 'important' as academic skills.   It's not binary... https://t.co/SAfMzo4Ct9

@arotherham @russianmachine I think the use of 'cleaver' in this context wins the gold medal in the Word Olympics of this statement.
