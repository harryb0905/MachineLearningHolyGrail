@TacoAffcionado @slwein shut it karen
@MikeAmmo You know this based on what? Survey data? Given the other replies you've gotten, I don't think your generalization is accurate at all. (I haven't paid &lt; $1000 in rent/mortgage since 1999, BTW.)
@MikeAmmo wait, you live in a city where rents are under $1000 but it costs $50+ to uber back to your place? is this brigadoon?
@KCHSBall @pitchingschool You're correct - I'm criticizing the tweeter, not the kid. Who knows if that's his delivery all the time (I doubt it, hard to repeat that). And I don't diagnose off video of one pitch, ever.
@KCHSBall @pitchingschool That’s not correct. We do know some things - for example, pitching more while fatigued increases injury risk; throwing harder, at your peak velocity, increases injury risk; certain mechanical factors increase injury risk.
@KCHSBall @pitchingschool I agree that the appearance of "intent," and even the word "intent," is meaningless.
@griersonleitch @vulture about ten spots higher than i expected it to be (or than it deserved)
@CoachCCom @dandeyoung @_JeremyBooth @birdsonabatshow huh, and here i thought there was 'intent' to have a serious conversation. My mistake.
@CoachCCom @Joseph58Green Scherzer as an example is survivorship bias.
@MrMaxPrice No, since the tweet with video were a perfect example of the phenomenon.
@TheDataCage @Challenger_ST Without question. I don't even finish reading the tweet when that happens. What a child.
@MrMaxPrice Yeah, you missed the entire point, which I have elucidated multiple times now: Encouraging kids to throw as hard as they can, above all else, is irresponsible. How you interpret that as being a knock on the kid is beyond my comprehension.
@MrMaxPrice @FlatgroundApp Again, not calling the kid out, and if you're going to keep saying that I don't think there's anything to discuss here.
@tyler_hank @MrMaxPrice I didn't attack the kid at all, let alone "shit on him." GMAFB.
@MrMaxPrice Unless you think the kid or his family did not consent to PG posting it publicly, I completely disagree.
@MrMaxPrice Irresponsible how? Nobody should be encouraging kids to throw as hard as they can regardless of effort or mechanics. Seems responsible enough to me.
@kcbases @soupville @Adam_Puzio I don't know who is in your video, what it has to do with the question at hand, or why you think it's OK to insult me for my opinion that encouraging young pitchers to throw as hard as they can with visible effort is dangerous.
@JustinCChang great piece, Justin. Especially enjoyed your list of movies from 2018 that handled race &amp; race relations better than GB. (I'd add Blindspotting but I know your list wasn't meant to be complete.)
@Amberintheskye @latimes I think that was the author's point - if this movie moved you, it's because the script is so glib and manipulative. Anyway, thank you for the response.
@kcbases @soupville @Adam_Puzio Strawman, argumentum ad hominem. Is that what PDS pays you to do?

You should have stopped there.
@VrinMarbleye @phildownn Disagree. Critical consensus had Black Panther in this range, way ahead of Infinity War.
@NateSpringfield @SergioMQuintero @Bonner_time and a collision on the field, no?
@TheRealAlexGels @NRO @KatTimpf deservedly so, since the entire premise is based on a tweet of no import
@gabe_toro maybe but he's had some injury history that might dissuade him
@NateSpringfield @SergioMQuintero @Bonner_time correct, he hurt his shoulder
@thesportssnob @DreamingBasebll I’ve seen 60+ movies from last year and at least a dozen will stay with me for a decade. Roma, Burning, The Favourite, Shoplifters, Beast, You Were Never Really Here, Cold War…
@soupville @Adam_Puzio "Intent" has no particular meaning here. Two pitchers can both throw 96, but one may do so with less risk to his elbow or shoulder than the other. Encouraging kids to throw hard, without regard to the process, is irresponsible.
@jorient @Takethatdoctors @rlamartini Yeah, that's not true about the vaccine, and you should lose your license for disseminating such false information.
@soupville @Adam_Puzio I’m sorry but I don’t follow - what do you mean by “intent is warranted but then shunned?”
@Amberintheskye @latimes I thought Justin Chang did an excellent job here to explain why it’s a bad film among BP winners. Why do you feel like the review won’t engage people who liked the film?
@flubs68 @phildownn great argument, very compelling points
@soupville @Adam_Puzio Yeah, I didn’t do any of that, but keep insulting me because you missed the point.
@JVandal42 https://t.co/LltKUoGW9f
@CoachCCom The goal should be to do no harm. That post encourages kids to throw hard regardless of how they do so.
@CoachCCom And your claim about how I'd rank such a kid as a draft prospect if he was throwing 97+ is simply wrong.
@CoachCCom Nobody is after the kid. It's the culture of praising velocity over all else, without regard to how it's generated. You say it "can be safe," but it is often not. There's real research showing pitchers trying to throw at max velocity are at higher risk for TJ.
@CoachCCom that’s now two tweets that have nothing to do with what I said. good job, I guess
@Amberintheskye @latimes do you not know how newspapers work
@one_pitch_man I’ve heard the same. Remember the hype at the time, at least.
@norcalbbgm @MozingoBaseball @_JeremyBooth I find it very hard to believe anyone could repeat those mechanics, let alone throw strikes that way.
@paintingcorner he mentioned him in the quoted tweet
@jfreemyer ugh. RIP.
@DJWeedPizza @Pernellius Knee problems may have led to weight gain which ended his usefulness
@cristoferdeo was he a great talent? just a bit before my time
@GuanellaLou @SergioMQuintero We’re also just throwing names out there. Feel free to add your own.
@jayberger yeah good one, overused big time at LSU
JR Richard. Koufax. Fidrych. All baseball-related. Fernandez and Ventura in unrelated tragedies. https://t.co/5fj1RQSTw2
@one_pitch_man encouraging kids to throw as hard as they can regardless of how they do it
@Joseph58Green I just don’t want to encourage kids to throw hard at all costs
@Joseph58Green I never said anything like that about Lincecum. I worried that he couldn’t hold his delivery deep enough into games but I never wrote that I worried about injury
@AdamJRasmussen @stopthistrain28 More of a recent thing, since it's so much easier to see good films (NOT GREEN BOOK) than it was in the past
https://t.co/eGGQaq1sCi
@birdsonabatshow @BratchAttack I go to minor league camps every year. You are mistaken about the strike zone. Less than 90, probably still wrong, but it's a low %.
@tsaundry13 Different question entirely. Shows me you're just trying to argue for argument's sake. Good night.
@GarretJoseph10 I'm just telling you to do with your personal twitter account, Gerry.
@birdsonabatshow @BratchAttack No they're not. Some do and we should discourage that. Many kids get to 90+ with better, more repeatable mechanics.
@BratchAttack @birdsonabatshow I just watched two HS kids this week, both with average fastballs, who are likely first-rounders and earned raves from scouts who were there with me because of all the other stuff they could do. The days of Colt Griffin or even Tyler Kolek going high in the draft are over.
@tsaundry13 I never, ever said this kid was going to need TJ. Never. Read better.
@rebeccapbp Spider-Man?
@tsaundry13 Is that your issue? Is that why you cited three pitchers who throw super hard and didn't break down, rather than looking at all the pitchers who threw hard and considering how many did break down?
@zqxjk I'm sorry for you. I watch subtitled films all the time and never give them a second thought.
@BratchAttack @birdsonabatshow That's one coach. I can't speak for every single person. And there are probably still some pro teams who'd just draft a kid off straight velocity. But by and large now teams are looking for a lot more than pure mph. Lower velocity with higher spin attracts more teams.
@tsaundry13 It's major surgery. You're OK with that? Good with your kid getting cut open, risking complications - ever heard of MRSA? - with the 15-20% chance he doesn't come back as well? I'm sure as hell not.
@tsaundry13 Yes, exactly. That is what the research tells us (see Chalmers et al, for one). If you have actual research that says something else, please fire it over.
@GarretJoseph10 Good riddance. I don't like followers who tell me what to tweet on my own, personal twitter account.
@zqxjk What's wrong with subtitles, exactly? I wasn't aware movies had to be made in your language.
@edsbs @jessicawluther My #1 movie of 2017. Mooney will slay you.
@birdsonabatshow Straw man. We're not looking for guys who throw 80 mph, but we are looking for guys who show command or control, repeat their deliveries, show one or more good secondary pitches, and show the ability to use all their pitches to get hitters out. Velocity alone isn't it.
@tsaundry13 Because the best available research says that pitchers throwing as hard as they can, as often as they can, are at higher risk of requiring ligament transplant surgery. The only way to find out if a player is "physically capable of handling" this is to see if he breaks.
@RaspberryGoulet https://t.co/b8yk4w5ZaC
@DamySoxfan I never called anything worst "as a factual description." And yeah, you got personal. Good night.
@Ric_swish10 @tommygallegos It *is* harmful. We have research showing that pitchers trying to throw as hard as they can as much as they can are at higher risk of TJ. Encouraging kids to do this is irresponsible.
@DamySoxfan Oh, now we get the personal insults? FOH.
@BriRobitaille This is twitter - the format encourages brevity. If you want my full review, it's right here. https://t.co/RoqBvYjvP3
@Johny_Clipboard I would never claim you can perfectly predict injuries by mechanics or velocity, but why would anyone encourage a kid to do this?
@tsaundry13 https://t.co/FYqDOVoM4Q
@AGoldRedshield I'm glad to hear that - I will watch it, but at home, probably over 2-3 sittings.
@BriRobitaille That line is a great example of bad writing. The whole script is bad - cheap jokes, stock characters, and revisionist history.
@Byron_D11 @ManyFaceG0d @hustledouble @Crawford_MILB Good call
@hustledouble @Crawford_MILB Hendricks?
@Therealrhyno The next time I'm concerned with how I look I'll be sure to consult with the real rhyno then
@DamySoxfan Curious how many movies you saw from 2018
@DodgersMemeTeam If you think I'm trashing that kid, boy did you ever miss the point.
@kimnealintx I will, just on a small screen. I was concerned seeing it in the theater would give me a migraine
Yeah nothing against this kid but by "high intent delivery" do you mean dangerously max effort because he's trying to show off for your radar gun? https://t.co/T1BuVIrub7
@Stat_Ron As I've said in other places, directors and writers who win Oscars get more opportunities to make more films. So it's rational to want people who produce quality work to win these and other awards.
@rebeccapbp @charles_kinbote @HunterFelt Senior year of HS for me - but granted, I wouldn't have read it on my own till way later had I not been assigned it
@ledwithd Did you really bet? I hope so!
@Ryanwtking @TimCDriscoll Classy. I think you should unfollow me now.
@ledwithd Did you hear the air get sucked out of that room oh my god

@kecantona I really need to watch that
@GarretJoseph10 no
@GeorgeTeachman Good point and that's not a factor with Bale, Dafoe, or Mortensen, who were also playing real people but didn't have to satisfy fans of those men
@AGoldRedshield No, not yet. I can't fathom sitting in a theater for 188 minutes (plus previews!). I've seen the other four, plus two shortlisted films (Burning, The Guilty), plus I think four other countries' submissions (Netherlands, Indonesia, Finland, Norway).
@ExcaliburWilly @frownpouch nah
@GeorgeTeachman ah I got it. I thought it was more impersonation than performance. Did you disagree?
@bdelbanco I haven’t heard Singer mentioned anywhere at all
MILLERRRRRRRR https://t.co/K1mp3w2N9d
@GeorgeTeachman they are subjective, yet you just called me pretentious for having a different opinion than you?
@plainstiger94 You should be embarrassed. It's OK, though. You'll get over it.
@AudreyBaerry I thought he was far better and so was Cooper. The best performances of the year by actors weren't even nominated - Hawke (First Reformed) and Phoenix (You Were Never Really Here)
@plainstiger94 No, I have. What's clear is you've read one side of this, accepted it because it's what you want to believe, and have ignored the other side. It fits.
this is for Best Prosthetic Teeth right?
@plainstiger94 Sure Jan
@Ryanwtking I've never said anything of the sort. I gave my opinion and supported it.
@SuperJuancho91 I never said anything about you as a person. If that's where you want to go with this, I'm bowing out.
@plainstiger94 @SuperJuancho91 I'm aware that's the writer's post hoc claim, which the family ALSO disputes. #um
@TheCompanyGuy If great films, directors, writers, actors win major awards, then they'll get to do more work with bigger budgets.
@SuperJuancho91 Trash. Right down to the humor, which was decidedly lowbrow.
@Jakethesnake492 @SuperJuancho91 I answered you already.
@HotTakeMacheen One I haven't written up yet was the Indonesian submission for the Oscars, Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts, which is on amazon prime. Feminist western, strong female POV, but the protagonist is raped on screen, and there is some brief but graphic violence.
@Jakethesnake492 @SuperJuancho91 The director doesn't write the script, and the tweet to which you replied was entirely about the script.
@SuperJuancho91 no, it was trash, unfunny, with a hackneyed white savior plot that shit all over the legacy of a great musician of color whose family came out against how it revised history.
@HotTakeMacheen I did my top ten of last year. Burning was my #1 and didn’t get a nomination. Beast, If You Were Never Really Here, and The Endless were also in my top ten and none was nominated for anything
@frownpouch it’s a damn tragedy is what it is
@SuperJuancho91 really?
@TRUTHorDINGERS @HotTakeMacheen white and male, that is
@TRUTHorDINGERS @HotTakeMacheen overwhelmingly white and make still?
@ledwithd even money on that right now
@JasonAFleming @AudreyBaerry moving the goalposts now? cool. go stan for white savior pablum somewhere else
@HotTakeMacheen there were so so many great films last year, from here, the UK, around the world.
@JasonAFleming @AudreyBaerry Yeah, those aren’t the same thing by a LONG shot chief.
a movie where the white hero says to his African-American employer “I’m blacker than you” just won an Oscar *for its script*
@SteelyDanRather good call, definitely deserved a nod over this mess
@HotTakeMacheen I saw every movie that got a major nomination except Free Solo and Never Look Away.
@AudreyBaerry Don Shirley’s family disagreed.
@phildownn Green Book was the worst of those five movies by a LOT
@camleez same

@joemayo17 Appalled after I saw Capernaum, which isn’t half the movie, and which has some problematic details around its production.
@mdj6248 @mort2885 @charles_kinbote @HunterFelt I think the issue is that she’s acting like we all hid the book from her - or that she made some great discovery. The book is not obscure and it has a broad, substantial reputation.
@DTLAlivin Dude, if you don’t appreciate the movie, that’s fine, but acknowledge that people see merit in it that you missed.
@RichinGlynn @netflix I watched in Dutch with subtitles. Those hard ch and h sounds are kind of wonderful.
@pimtarnacott right? as the script peels back the layers it just keeps getting better
@rflax @peacecorpdad Of Fathers and Sons is remarkable. It shouldn’t even exist.
The Resistance Banker, the Dutch submission for the Oscars. On @netflix. Great if you like WWII movies or spy thrillers or just stories of real life heroes. https://t.co/lLGdAR1h3m

@davidwakeman @bromleynyc I don’t agree. He got old and stopped making hard contact or using the whole field well.
@spry20111 I do think the AAV should have been higher given his youth and production to date. Have to think he’s a 6 WAR player for the first half of the deal if not more, right?

@spry20111 Yes, probably some of every stripe. But I'm definitely not an eat-the-rich guy, nor am I a taxation-is-theft guy. The research on the effects of moving the top marginal rate shows benefits and costs.
@spry20111 I have at least a little background in economics, and know that any change in marginal tax rates tends to have wide-ranging (and often unintended) consequences. I certainly don't favor raising tax rates on lower-income earners.
@spry20111 @FatGuysRun @MissionChaos Except 1) i've never been melodramatic about Machado and 2) you are really ignorant if you think I'm 'pro-heavy taxes,' but hey, keep talking out of your ass, it's a great look

@bromleynyc No, it’s not pushing it. You made a bad argument that doesn’t apply to two stars entering their age-27 seasons.
@JohnnyWishb0ne yes anonymous twitter user has better grasp of MLB revenues than people in industry do, totally believable
@bromleynyc A-Rod’s first deal worked out fabulously. Cano’s has been very good so far. Pujols was a LOT older when he signed his current deal.
@_ToddBauer I’ve never said otherwise.
@CubbableHoosier I disagree that it is but that falls under "would not"
@nyyanksrdbest @ZacharyKinion If the source existed, which I don't believe it did, given what people in the organization have told me. People need to stop following fake reporters like that - it just undermines the work that professionals do

@ALLTheDude all of these https://t.co/aioeV3PhoK

@mlark7 @joetweets1987 Their goods are commodities, undifferentiated from those you'd buy at other retailers. You want to support free markets? Learn a bit about how they work. Taxes do distort decision-making, as do subsidies, but your idea that they are passed straight through to consumers is wrong.
@mlark7 @mdj6248 @joetweets1987 oh, well if you put it in ALL CAPS, that seals it. and that is *still* not how pricing works even under imperfect competition. If amazon has to pay federal taxes - the report has been that they paid none - they can't simply raise all their prices without losing sales.
@mauten1 @RushingBaseball I would say yes, at least enough to play him over Desmond.

@KindaClarkKent yes
@mizzouproud17 If you’ve taken even an introduction to economics course, you’d know price is set by the market and is a function of supply and demand, which may each be affected by taxes/subsidies. But you can’t just set a price based on your costs unless you have no competition.
@IWWWallace I agree on point 2. But the luxury tax functions as any tax does - it distorts spending decisions by making some choices more expensive.
@kingharis it would provide the strong disincentive against tanking, but of course there are logistical obstacles here

@Steve_Armato @philkid3 @blykmyk44 That’s not proof of anything, Steve. N of 1. And Betts made mechanical changes that better explain it.
@Steve_Armato @blykmyk44 @philkid3 Wow that’s embarrassing. OBP is in OPS so you’re double counting. OPS itself is flawed because it’s bad math and overweights power. Nobody in baseball uses Runs or RBI or average any more - you’re just a decade behind.
@jdarnbro thanks! hope you enjoy it
@Steve_Armato @philkid3 @blykmyk44 who said OBP doesn’t matter? can you speak in anything but strawmen?
@Steve_Armato @blykmyk44 @philkid3 Word salad. I asked you a specific question that requires a specific answer. What are the “major offensive categories” that you have decided matter?
@Steve_Armato @blykmyk44 @philkid3 okay what are the “major offensive categories?” who decides whose?
@Steve_Armato @philkid3 @blykmyk44 ooh a straw man!
@Steve_Armato @blykmyk44 @philkid3 Offense is only one part of the game, and I don’t even know what “five categories” you mean.
@kenberman That’s not what he said at all.
I have an economics degree from Harvard but sure, Adam Smith, tell me more https://t.co/1FMdrDgRPD
@kenberman No, he’s not correct. Analytics guys aren’t preventing anything. If a DH is most valuable, then writers who use analytics will vote for him.
@VrinMarbleye what? You know I voted for Edgar, right?
@kenberman because analytics folks are know for their intellectual inconsistency? GMAB
yes. “Analytic guys” just got a DH in the Hall of Fame. https://t.co/q1Aqrq4P3h

@HalberstramMar1 @broshuis @kyler416 @UncleCharlie50 Your fabricated definition of “real job” doesn’t even hold up: the Blue Jays and MLB are already marketing Vlad Guerrero Jr.  And even organizational players provide value to the MLB team by providing playing opportunities to prospects.
@HalberstramMar1 @broshuis @kyler416 @UncleCharlie50 Dude, you have NO idea what players go through if you think this isn’t a “real job.” Spend some time in or around a clubhouse before you run your mouth.

@77Serenade No. Lie-shaming. Good try though.

@cmccosky ah yes, the personal attack is always effective when your argument has no basis. Stop calling your fans idiots when you don’t even know where a player played two years ago.
@cmccosky Which is why competent front offices don’t evaluate players based on “camp.” He hit more than well enough in AA in 2017 to move up - and returning him to AA would have been a mistake. #twidiots

@RickPaulas @DickLittle1 “Fans rooting for bargains and hating overpays feeds into it.” is absolutely true and I agree it’s pernicious.
@DSzymborski this backronym sucks
@MyothaTwitta I don't think this will remind anyone - they'll either walk past it every day (inattention bias) or they'll find it actively annoying as I do because it insults their intelligence.
@RickPaulas @DickLittle1 I don't know what Moneyball refers to if it's neither the book nor the Oakland strategy. Fans may accept losses now, but it is in exchange for more potential wins in the future.
@Rob__Sly are you feeling … the tension? https://t.co/Ql9VDRDLUo
@RickPaulas @DickLittle1 Fans accepting or requesting fewer wins. I know no fans who want that and that was never the point of the book or Oakland’s philosophy at the time.
@FireMacRFN sure. still dumb AF.
@noahgittell also a good point
i don't mean just in clubhouses, i mean ... ever. Imagine thinking a poster version of the "BENGHAZI" backronym was a good method of motivating employees. Especially professional athletes who tend to be ultra-competitive to start with.

@mike_petriello @lonestarball right, because teams may have similar projections of on-field production, but the value of that production will differ for each team, so they should absolutely not have the same financial valuations.
@Schieslmynizzle @poniewozik @bruce_arthur eh, a lot of critics thought Moonlight was the best picture of its year. I wouldn't dispute that one. But if anything but Roma wins this year it's a farce.

@matthewpouliot that’s a very bad take for several reasons, among them Sean’s lengthy injury history at the time he signed that deal.
@jmk4747 @mattkremnitzer Sure, but recognize that I evaluate all systems, whereas you probably know Baltimore's well but others, like Kansas City's, far less. The Royals did just have 5 picks in the top 58 last June, and had a few major prospects in A-ball from previous drafts/international signings.
@slwein same. how could you read Shakespeare, most 19th or early 20th century British or American literature, and nearly all pre-1940s poetry without that foundation?

@mdj6248 @DarrylJohnston @BrianImmekus1 I'd be willing to bet he rolls out a couple of 7-8 WAR seasons in that span, and if I think my team is a contender in those years, he will be worth way more than $30 million to the top line. If there's a 1.3 WAR season in there, it'll be more than mitigated by his best.
@meanmrmustard2 yeah but those deals (Miggy and Pujols) were ill-advised on even traditional grounds. The variables that made those bad moves don't apply to the main FA still on the market.

@Dew_U_Nomie_ @ithrow88 @CespedesBBQ https://t.co/lYFv2RoI43
@NicholasBarone Batting average is a lousy measure of production and nobody is basing a long-term contract decision on a single-year WAR.
@beckdawg_83 Also, I see WS winners with $184 million and $189 million contracts, so maybe slow your roll here.
@beckdawg_83 That’s some serious cherry picking (and an arbitrary endpoint), and definitely not a message of analytics.
@DarrylJohnston @BrianImmekus1 I think we are actually on the same side here. #fistbump
@ithrow88 @CespedesBBQ How'd that work out for you
@DarrylJohnston @BrianImmekus1 I thought Brian was referring to fans who see Harper's 2018 WAR (which is problematic) and call him a 1.3 WAR player. Maybe I misunderstood?
@flanaganbrian76 Haven't seen Free Solo and didn't love MtG. Of Fathers and Sons was remarkable, so was Dark Money, and Hale County is unique even though I don't feel like I totally got the point.
@DuffTheGlueGuy Yes, or at least yes enough for twitter purposes
@Johnny0404 No, because of that very reason.
@DarrylJohnston @BrianImmekus1 He's not a 1.3 WAR PLAYER. That is DUMB.
@jazmasri Have you seen @iramhaq's What Will People Say? Submitted by Norway but it didn't make the shortlist. Very good (and both written &amp; directed by her)

@whiteericb Thanks, I truly wasn't sure where you were going with that.
@KassyDillon @benshapiro https://t.co/NGVgAMqg5L
@acesover5 I would pay Harper $350MM over ten years. why would you look at just one season?
@whiteericb Who's ridiculing him?
@jtgr8ful @alexrene216 Okay now I'm convinced you're just a Tom ricketts burner account
@nickhawks411 I don’t agree. Analysts would be the first to point out that he’s more valuable than public WAR figures imply.
@nickhawks411 “Analytics” also say one-year samples are not sufficiently large for defensive metrics
@jtgr8ful @alexrene216 He wasn’t a generational guy. And the Cubs can easily afford one of these guys. You just bought their excuse.
@jtgr8ful @BrianImmekus1 Teams are not using public WAR. they have their own.
@IWWWallace @ThomasHayostek Those two are not equivalent because roster spots are limited
@JoeDooWahDiddy Harper and Machado are not past their primes.
@wad526 https://t.co/dnjBFBq99V
@nowyrdoingit @gibsonandrew nice and whoa
@VirginiaYankee1 I agree.
@Dale_Sams JBJ is wildly underpaid. But you also cut out Harper’s best year, and there’s a whole conversation about whether his 2018 WAR is at all predictive given his sudden defensive liability.
@BrianImmekus1 the problem with that statement is thinking Bryce Harper is “a 1.3 WAR guy”

@jeffbajenaru @Darin_A_2_ @lloydpparsons Royal Blood has had a couple of really good albums, a bit heavier in tone but still very straight-ahead rock. Drenge's debut album and their EP from last year were both really strong, smart rock records.
@DebSeymour51 On a related note, let me clarify AGAIN that while Queens and Brooklyn are part of Long Island, if you are from either borough you are not *from* Long Island. You are from Queens or Brooklyn.

I don't believe that for a second. One, I think Kyler just flat out prefers football, but didn't see a path to an NFL career until this past fall.

LRT was for my uncle, who took his own life 14 years ago this month, with a gun. Maybe if he doesn't have the firearm, he lives through the attempt, and he gets to meet my daughter 16 months later. I'll never know.
@hashtagbeatla @Lovegrove19 Yes although I'd go back two albums to To Be Everywhere Is To Be Nowhere over Palms. Stronger overall for me and I think they stretched out more musically.
@DavidTalbert19 who are your favorites from previous eras?
@Darin_A_2_ @lloydpparsons Check out Turbowolf’s The Free Life or INHEAVEN’s self-titles album for music in the same general style but that I find more original and less slickly produced.
@Expittriate GVF is overproduced and unoriginal. They’re an A-ball band playing in the big leagues.
@Lovegrove19 I have a feeling most of the bands I like wouldn’t appeal to you, but just staying within these narrow genres, Turbowolf’s The Free Life, Toundra’s Vortex, INHEAVEN’s self titled album, Mastodon’s Emperor of Sand, and Quicksand’s Interiors are all excellent.
@Lovegrove19 @weller_sean Tend to agree. “Kiss This” is catchy as hell but nothing we haven’t heard before.
@Expittriate LZ synthesized blues sounds into something new. GVF is recycling decades-old sounds.
@Darin_A_2_ @lloydpparsons None of that applies to me.
@Lovegrove19 The “actual music” bar is an awfully low one to clear. There are thousands of bands writing and recording their own music on traditional rock instruments. Let’s reward the original ones.
@Lovegrove19 Sure. just don’t give them an award for an album of such derivative work.
@Lovegrove19 They may be skilled musicians, but their songwriting is not original enough to earn this honor.
@owenpoindexter why not Colors? just a sort of creative explosion with great hooks

@thjeca @gbib21 And you sure as f don’t have the liberty to deny your child medicine when they’re sick. Courts have ruled on this repeatedly - and ruled religion doesn’t trump vaccination requirements too
@thjeca @gbib21 You gave up some of that “liberty” to live in a civilized society. You don’t have the liberty to harm or kill someone else. You don’t have the liberty to take things you don’t own. And you shouldn’t have the liberty to spread preventable, deadly diseases.
@thjeca Which is why more states are tightening those or eliminating the exemption entirely. Everything you said in your first response was wrong.
@thjeca False.
@thjeca Vaccination is not a “medical procedure.” There is no force - it is a requirement for attending public school, because unvaccinated children are a risk to others. So they are wrong, as are you.

@jonbecker_ every day this week through Sunday
@birb_fm I only rank farm systems based on players actually in the system.
@MrsPABBK @PaulTFurlong manly men who think they're going to catch a foul line drive coming at them in excess of 100 mph are thinking with something other than their brains

FB friend: you going to watch the #SOTU?  me: https://t.co/pMSeSG3ESp
@JHizzy90 a lot of guys should try it, but I have yet to figure out what makes a particular candidate well-suited to succeed
@kenjilopezalt das ist ein Pizza
@willsommer womp womp
@wearesmrt not that I hate the changes, but the process doesn't make sense to me - the players were succeeding, so who ordered the changes, and why were they so ordered? That stuff should come from the top of player development.
@Melissybk @TacoAffcionado that is obscene
@lmeehan3 shortest distance between two points
@BlueJaysExpress i don't.
@joeypotato1 @Huskerdonut @SopanDeb @sepinwall @AOC ok bot https://t.co/e3k8wTHpCw
@Aus10Turner Diaz and Mountcastle are not top 100 prospects.
point of reference, the two men pictured did not make this farm system https://t.co/iiXYt5qJKZ
@robmellon89 Freese improved as a player for off-field reasons. Descalso has a career WAR of 1.9, so if i'd ever ranked him as a top 100 prospect that would have been a miss. Craig is barely better, also never should have been ranked.
@jayrigdon5 https://t.co/44LqlW9oIr
@robmellon89 Lance Lynn was a first-round pick. Jay was on Team USA as an amateur. Good prospects turned into good players. There's no evidence that "winning in the minors carried over to the majors," though.
@CrawfishBoxes come on, that post today about my farm rankings is ... not good. your site is way better than that. Minor league affiliates making the playoffs has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the prospects in the system.
maybe it's just me but if a source claimed to me they had a photographic memory I'd ask them to prove it, just like if a source told me they could fly I'd throw them out the nearest window #trustbutverify
@TheCut @annaesilman @JillAbramson Abramson told you she has an "almost photographic memory," which is cool and all except that eidetikers' memories are NOT perfect. https://t.co/axVtYyn7m4 https://t.co/WOTxfVxUNy
@SopanDeb @sepinwall https://t.co/axVtYyn7m4 https://t.co/lLS00WrpCK
@jwsewall I think I have him just right.
@Dooch2009 agreed. although it's fun to see fans show their asses over them
@mort2885 @TheOriginalBull I poured more water into this funnel, therefore the funnel should be more full
@RadioJoe7 @Thatbaseballfan I don't care what other sources say. I stand by my evaluations. Good luck.
All prospects are players, but not all players are prospects. https://t.co/NxXza0nH8t
@robmellon89 My opinion is evidence-based. I understand your ideas here but I don’t think they are sufficiently supported in fact.
@craigcalcaterra https://t.co/AaKbhzHNpP
@ShaneChills https://t.co/iOpT4hNJ7j
@robmellon89 Sorry, but it has nothing at all to do with the quality of the prospects or the system.
@robmellon89 No, they should not. It’s not germane. You can win at the minor league level with older non-prospects.
@brianlopez22 I see as many as I can, watch video, talk to scouts and executives I trust. It takes 5-6 weeks to assemble and write.
@robmellon89 No. Team success is not an indicator of player quality or projection.
@Simmy886 @jonbecker_ His rate stats have stayed over 100 because he no longer faces LHP.
@RadioJoe7 @Thatbaseballfan you're friends with Jim Callis? Would he confirm that?   And no, "most in the industry" would not agree with you. They'd think you're a fan being a fan.
@Simmy886 @jonbecker_ Age isn’t “just a number,” he’s not an above average offensive bat, and he’s a below average defender in a corner. otherwise good tweet
@rgf482 @Thatbaseballfan @RadioJoe7 he’s having a normal one
@jenmacramos @WhitneyM02 possible only one person really read it through ... and i don't know how diverse their editorial staff is
@caprisunburn correct
@jay_jaffe @TheTonyFiorigli don't get me started, i have enough to rant about as it is this week
@em_dash01 @jenmacramos fair point. I've also never had to write about a victim, so I'm a little out of my depth here. Probably seeing the article through my lens, as someone familiar with trauma/PTSD, rather than the lenses of other readers.
@TheTonyFiorigli @jay_jaffe in the era of the 12-man pitching staff, i'm not sure you can carry a LHB who can barely play corner OF and nowhere else. Really limits your bench
@zenhussy @jenmacramos if i knew the player's name i'd reveal it
@jay_jaffe understood. And i know that wasn't your comment either.
@jenmacramos I agree with you there. The writer should have phrased it way better. I'd be happy to see more stories on assault victims explain the link between the trauma and subsequent mental health issues.
My latest review for @PasteMagazine covers the great board game Gizmos, one of my top 10 games of 2018, an engine-builder that's family-friendly and plays in well under an hour. https://t.co/KiC5svxjI2
@jenmacramos i interpreted that as showing the negative impact the assault may have had on her life since then - she experienced a serious trauma, and it has done awful things to her, as trauma does. They should name the player, though.
@jay_jaffe god, that's misleading as hell. He wasn't a "significantly above-average hitter" last year - he had 93% of his PA vs RHP. And he has no defensive value. Love the person, but I don't think he merits a 40-man spot at this stage of his career.
@HartmanMath Not really. And he can't hit.
@mosconml @britnidlc As far as I know, the Dodgers weren't told of the sexual assault allegation until much later. There are other issues here - if Dodgers' players got an underage girl drunk, then the team should have reported this to the police, for starters - so I'm not absolving anyone.

@RadioJoe7 @Thatbaseballfan Dude, you don’t know the players at all. That’s fine - that’s why I do what I do. But just throwing a bunch of names out and claiming they have “high ceilings” is not going to get us anywhere because it’s wrong.
no, no, all that matters is framing https://t.co/Cm8oSXdHas
@LeftHandedRach and the cost is trivial. I think the obstacle is the small number of fans who think their masculinity is being challenged by netting.
@jessek_86 @imjustaguy78 There’s a huge difference.
@jorgencomp @tarnita77 @AOC https://t.co/5THpPs1Z2N
@RadioJoe7 @Thatbaseballfan No they do not all have high ceilings. Not even close. I have personally scouted every player you’ve named but two, and I can tell you are just overrating names you’ve heard.
this was superb. Better than at least three of the five films nominated over it by @TheAcademy https://t.co/cr2xr7OUZt
@rjb37066 I already stopped caring what you think

@thekuhlest I can’t believe we’re first hearing about this six effing months later
@DrMike5150 same
@Brandon_Warne scary
@tbuss76 😂
@Brandon_Warne right, but I think it reinforces the need for netting where they can put it. even over the netting it was coming fast enough to kill

@stephaniekays @AKAdocbrown and then there’s Nyctophobia from @Pandasaurusgame which was designed by Catherine Stippell, a now college student while she was still in HS
@stephaniekays @AKAdocbrown heck, @PlanBGames_ was founded and is helmed by Sophie Gravel, who also founded and sold ZMan Games. She might be the most important woman in tabletop.
@RadioJoe7 He’s not 15th in their system. Also, he was a reach at that pick and then missed all of 2018.
@HumanitiesMD @stephaniekays Understood. I think it is neglect, personally.
@HumanitiesMD @stephaniekays that’s a huge part of my philosophical objection to these parents. Their so called “vaccine choice” doesn’t affect them. It affects the child for whom they are responsible. If they deny the child medicine, they can go to jail. This isn’t much different.

@nolan_thibeault well, it's my job to know those prospects, and those of all the teams.
@nolan_thibeault I can’t speak to others’ rankings but I would have a very hard time making an argument that they have a top ten system. Their prospect list isn’t that deep yet, not like my top ten systems are
@nolan_thibeault It's not a sarcastic answer. You said they improved; they did. But other teams still exist. This ranking is relative - a team can improve a lot, but only move up a couple of spots because of what teams around them in the rankings did.
@nolan_thibeault I rank all 30 teams. I think there are 17 better.

@stephaniekays @HumanitiesMD christ. how about 'if you want us to deliver your baby, you will accept the vitamin K shot?'
@JasonKerepesi The original question is "who'd be the best." Not who has the most hits. Not who'd be the most popular. Just "best," which leaves the definition up to each of us. If you like the alt-rock Metallica served up in the '90s, more power to you. I don't. I'm done with this dumb thread.
@RipkenRanger32 @KindaClarkKent @oriolesfan68 "I am do not care to hear"  OK, sparky. You really haven't gotten anything right here. Go have fun with your racist hat.
@dan_scooby @AEDLING all correct except I think I go to at least 20 prospects for all but maybe two teams
@ELJGON i am smoking something right now ... incense
lot to unpack here https://t.co/c1ec1umT8n
@JasonKerepesi This is truly hilarious. Do you think this is some sort of evidence-based argument? In my opinion, Metallica's last good album was released in 1988. You can disagree. But the condescending act here is especially absurd over something so entirely subjective.
@Ponyboy3123 thanks for your feedback
@RipkenRanger32 @KindaClarkKent @oriolesfan68 You have now stated three times what I think about DL Hall, none of them correct. If you're not going to read what I wrote, then sit this thread out.

@RipkenRanger32 @oriolesfan68 I wrote him up last week. Not sure what “the numbers don’t lie” means though.

@DrBobCaldwell that was very much part of my thinking
@LegalMaruchana sure
@DavidARodrigue7 @MLBPipeline I explain my methodology at the top of the post.
@oriolesfan68 top 100, not top 50.
@oriolesfan68 Mullins and Santander no longer qualify as rookies, and while I liked Hays off 2017, you can't put much value on him after last year.
@DavidARodrigue7 @MLBPipeline Yeah, those aren't facts. You're literally asking me to use someone else's opinions on prospect grades when I evaluate prospects myself. MLB thinks the Marlins have the fourth-most grade 50 prospects. I do not think so.
@oriolesfan68 I don’t agree at all. Their depth is poor compared to other orgs.
@oriolesfan68 I don’t think they have either.
@Corey0Smith @minakimes ok you just made this weird
@DavidARodrigue7 @MLBPipeline I did. I don’t know where you got that “50 grade prospects” line, but it’s not factual.
@oriolesfan68 I have no idea. I don’t work on their rankings. I explained why I had them where I did.

@joelcreese @Daaavvveeeee @dervack You’re welcome. Maybe you won’t like it, although I hope you do. I’m only saying that my original mention of Beck is based on my admiration for his recent non-bummer material. And I especially loved “Dreams.”
@joelcreese @Daaavvveeeee @dervack right and I just don’t think we can agree because we differ fundamentally on his recent output
@adjuster_cody okay
@joelcreese @dervack Nobody asked about the masses. The question was the best artist for the halftime show who hasn’t done one.
@joelcreese @dervack You also asked when his last good non-bummer song was, so either you didn’t listen to Colors or you didn’t like it, and either way we’re not going to agree.
@dervack @joelcreese It was my #1 album of that year. And his music has evolved over time.
@joelcreese @dervack Most of his 2017 album Colors, including Dreams, the title track, Dear Life

@Tony_Pumilia sure thing
@hardware_04 That it got nominated over If Beale Street Could Talk, First Reformed, Burning, even Widows or Annihiliation, is just appalling. A bad white-savior film that insults its African-American subject and traffics in bad stereotypes.
@Tony_Pumilia i never said that, but ok
@PMikePollack I'd disagree with that assessment. It didn't make my top ten but I liked it and thought it did many things well within a confining subgenre.

@DatDude_Ster42 @EireannDolan @1800Callabro the importance of pay-to-play events in identifying/scouting players has to decline. There's a huge barrier to entry for less privileged players.
@Cortyrone @BigStones00 @JPosnanski Yeah, it has. Not sure how you missed how badly the players are compensated in the NFL. You're offering very strong opinions from the narrow vantage point of 2019, and ignoring a lot of empirical evidence that what you argue isn't true.
@Chris_Dahl @joe_sheehan @eboland11 @timbhealey That was never in question here. It's certainly not Joe's point.
@jtgr8ful @eboland11 @timbhealey @joe_sheehan Excellent point. Not the one you were trying to make, though.
@Cortyrone @BigStones00 @JPosnanski The current market is more evidence that earlier free agency wouldn't have benefited players. Owners have sought to flood the market since Charlie Finley proposed making all players free agents every winter.
@eboland11 @cpbernhardtjr @ChrisJulienCPA @joe_sheehan @timbhealey If you read contemporary media accounts, you might come to a different conclusion. And that really goes beyond baseball - the US print media has long history of general disdain for organized labor.
@Cortyrone @BigStones00 @JPosnanski Yes. A hard cap.
@Cortyrone @BigStones00 @JPosnanski Because that came with a hard cap. At least be honest about what you’re describing.

@GaryWise1 @joe_sheehan @eboland11 @timbhealey nah we are on the same page here. I’ve just recently started advocating for a huge bump in the minimum salary for this reason.
@GaryWise1 @joe_sheehan @eboland11 @timbhealey I’d say the worst contracts in MLB right now belong to every good pre-arb player. Acuña and Ohtani are hilariously underpaid.
@GaryWise1 @joe_sheehan @eboland11 @timbhealey rather than the player’s?
@gphil24 @JPosnanski This is an impressive combination of confusing different issues (I’m not advocating anyone sign “bad” contracts) and a tu quoque fallacy.
@eboland11 @timbhealey @joe_sheehan The mainstream media coverage has been pro-owner for at least a century. That is certainly changing now, but fan attitudes won’t turn as quickly.
@eboland11 @timbhealey @joe_sheehan The AP’s breathless reporting of “player X gets 500% raise” when someone becomes arb eligible for the first time comes to mind.
@DrHietanen 100%. Medical exemptions only
@Cortyrone @JPosnanski Completely disagree.
@jroell86 typical
@sofianortonkmk well this is wrong, dangerous, and irresponsible.
@MyothaTwitta @BlueMoonisCraft It’s more than just “doing nothing” - it comes back to taxpayers propping up Liberty Media’s profits. Maybe they don’t need to spend to compete this year, but they also didn’t need a publicly subsidized stadium.

This week's roundup has stories on Nashville hot chicken, a blind bank robber, #metoo in DC restaurants, malfeasance in Kentucky, vaccine exemption fights in WA/OR/CA/AZ, climate change denial at the EPA, police incompetence in Eastland TX, and more: https://t.co/zdd5IxG9kD
Rich Hill was their fourth-round pick, and he did make the majors with the Cubs in 2005. Billy Petrick (3rd) and Rocky Cherry (14th) also got cups of coffee. https://t.co/lQeBC6UkMq
@biggentleben @lost_angeles I don't think he's a superstar, but he is valuable because he's probably the top offensive catcher right now - I think he led in WAR without framing

@beefalosoldier @jon_benick so many of these guys have tried CBT.
@beefalosoldier @jon_benick Except really nobody has ever succeeded at that. It's all words until he faces live pitching.
more good reasons the @Dbacks should rethink this plan of building Jackie Robinson Field in a well-off white suburb - do it downtown in the historically black part of Phoenix https://t.co/aiQF9mlnjp
@BlacklashAZ our mutual friend Katie thought you might be interested in this https://t.co/0fca9HYilO
@Marc_Normandin @JessicaFastball yes and yes
@Freddiesgato Yep, i thought that was confounding. the original short story is even more vague.
@Freddiesgato I say yes but it is ambiguous. what did you think?
@JeffLevine21 I don’t think so.
@kielholmes_3 there were a variety of problems
@craigcalcaterra justifying my decision to just block him
@aseerali4 been digging a little on this but certainly not good
@GovernorVA @vademocrats I’m here for the ratio but also to tell you to resign already
@Theo_DeRosa SHUT IT THEO
Hagerty was a first-round pick in the first draft I was ever involved in as a full-time baseball employee. I was with Toronto and we took Russ Adams. The first overall pick was Hagerty’s college teammate Bryan Bullington. I feel old now.
@jon_benick That might be low. And i’m certainly hoping i’m wrong.
I think I’d be way less surprised about a comeback at his age than i would be about any pitcher coming back from the yips (he walked 30 in 6 IP one year) https://t.co/DbHMfhKtjX
@Baseball_Mgr it came out this week
oh that’s nice https://t.co/n0UY1F1lSK
@RyanPayne32 @KrashKraemer @KindaClarkKent Yeah, projection systems have a very hard time with minor league data, even when adjusted ... IIRC they all had Matt Wieters debuting as a top 5-10 player in baseball. If Tatis stays at SS, I think he'll post several 6-8 WAR seasons at his peak (position + defense + bat + BR).
@Matt_Sciannella oh 100%
@HeyBarn @Cubs this is a good tweet
@RyanPayne32 @KrashKraemer @KindaClarkKent for a season? thanks for pointing out how disingenuous some of these claims have been
@Matt_Sciannella ralph?
@Baer_Bill this is very bad
@micetichbrad1 bat wrap is hard to describe without a picture - bat goes behind the hitter's head when he loads. action changeup has some kind of action to it, whether fade or sink or even tail, as opposed to deception just from lower velo at same arm speed
@DrewLou52 @OldTakesExposed Yeah, he's very different. Buehler was two full years older than Luzardo is now, and substantially bigger and stronger.
@PaulCoretti @KindaClarkKent @voiceofcohen Ricciardi did not fire me, although you saying so fits your pattern of not knowing what a fact is.
@PaulCoretti @KindaClarkKent @voiceofcohen "all say Vlad Jr is number one"  pssst no they don't, puck
@DrewLou52 @OldTakesExposed Nothing against @OldTakesExposed but I don't think tagging him in a disagreement about playing time and workloads for a 21-year-old not that far off TJ rehab is a good response, or a good use of his time. This isn't a hot take. I've seen Luzardo and talked to A's people about it.
@PaulCoretti @KindaClarkKent @voiceofcohen translated: "I follow publications that tell me what I want to hear"
@DrewLou52 @OldTakesExposed So you run and snitch-tag Fred because you don't agree with my opinion? Grow up.
@PaulCoretti @voiceofcohen Those rankings are opinions. And you said “I guess Keith just wants to be different from the rest of the group,” accusing me of altering my rankings for attention. That’s an attack, Pete.
@DrewLou52 @OldTakesExposed And what exactly is that supposed to do?
@DrewLou52 I’m not low on him. I’m realistic about 2019.
@PaulCoretti @voiceofcohen You haven’t presented facts, just opinions and the occasional attack on my integrity. Go fan somewhere else, Pat.

@Cortyrone That sounds like wishful thinking to me. I simply can’t indulge in that for this column.
@Jdon76 I'll have more notes on him in the Astros org report. I'm not sure how to answer your question otherwise. I will say unathletic 1b only types don't generally make my list.
@Jdon76 my list isn't a function of anyone else's lists, just my evaluations + those of scouts and executives
@itsOpeningDay Yes it's here https://t.co/P0W7ruHwNW
@RealRyanMesick Puk would have helped late in the year, and then they might have had him ready for the rotation this spring. That one stung the most because I heard he was better than ever right before the injury. Still hopeful about him.
@brenarlo I didn’t ask for your opinion.
@RealRyanMesick He threw 110 last year and that was in the minors, in controlled situations, nothing past AA. 150 IP from him in the majors in 2019 sounds like wishful thinking.
@lost_angeles @jordanhklein Smith isn’t far
@lost_angeles just not their philosophy
@RealRyanMesick Not just service time, although I imagine they'll consider that strongly. He missed most of 2016 and 2017 around TJ, and his workload was limited last year. I can't see him throwing, say, 140-150 major-league innings this year AND being highly effective right out of the gate.
@DBach12 @chrisgarosi MLB seldom updates those after a player reaches the majors. I doubt Altuve has weighed that little since 2013.
@RealRyanMesick Did you read the intro?
@ginnysearle my first winter at ESPN i made a five blades joke in a column for page 2 and was pleasantly surprised how many people got/liked the reference
@ginnysearle @jay_jaffe @fangraphs Moreno should just say f it, we're going to five blades, and sign Harper and Keuchel https://t.co/iTaKrBROPP
@DBach12 @chrisgarosi 1. if Jose Altuve weighs 165 pounds then I weigh about 82.  2. The reason to think Madrigal won't add enough muscle to matter is his frame. This is what Chris and I are talking about.
@510ProSports you've been whining all day, claiming I'm "always low" on the A's, lying about my rankings, all while hiding behind a username. If you don't care, and don't read, then don't comment. We'll both be better off.
@brenarlo @510ProSports Why would I agree with something that wasn't true? I never ranked them 28th or close. Feel free to unfollow.
@cjrdvm yeah, go tell @SharylAttkisson - who blocked me - to knock this crap off
@DBach12 @chrisgarosi Weight &lt;&gt; size.
@DBach12 @chrisgarosi No, he didn't use height or weight to say that they're different. Are you strictly here to be argumentative? If so please untag me.
@510ProSports yeah, i'm the problem here, not you, the petulant child whining behind a pseudonym and accusing a national writer of things he never did.
@tcb375 thanks, looks awesome! i think the writer makes a distinction without a difference, though - the Garage does Neapolitan-style, just not truly VPN, which isn't worth all that much IMO
@noahgittell @TheAcademy same director won for The Lives of Others. i imagine that swayed a lot of people
@510ProSports No, because that didn't happen. I think your diaper's full.
@Cortyrone He threw 25 innings during the regular season in 2018. How much do you think he'll really pitch?
@chrisgarosi amen. i even separate madrigal from the Bregman types - short, but with incredible hand strength
@noahgittell @TheAcademy i'd also love to know how many voters watched all of Never Look Away's 188 minutes ... not sure my attention span or my bladder could get me through that
@_MitchKnutson He has all of half a season in double-A, and still isn't playing 2b every day.
@BobbyAguilera on streaming now though
@chrisgarosi it is the most tiresome thing in baseball now - every twerp middle infielder is the next jose altuve
@noahgittell Korea has still never had a film get a nomination. That's an absolute joke. But @TheAcademy voters have a pretty clear bias towards European films in this category.
@BobbyAguilera yeah, and i'm kind of annoyed it got that far - Burning was so much better
@vincebaseball @Josh_Muller85 @DonsCentral i'll be there chasing the ghost of Kyler Murray
@Josh_Muller85 @DonsCentral @vincebaseball I never said the increase was the issue (there is zero evidence this is a factor in injuries). 150 major-league innings is going to mean a lot more stress than 110 mostly in low-A or double-A.
New dish post - the Lebanese film Capernaum, one of the five nominees for this year's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film: https://t.co/gPo8lvgsR2
@Josh_Muller85 @DonsCentral @vincebaseball One critical difference here is that I've spoken to team execs about how they might use him. Plans can change, of course, but you are guessing and I am not.
@DonsCentral @Josh_Muller85 @vincebaseball Exactly my thinking. He threw 43 innings in 2017, coming back from TJ in the spring of 2016, and I can't see the A's asking him to throw 140-150 innings in the majors this year as a rookie when their interest in keeping him healthy stretches over 6-7 more years.

@bryanarthur @BenZwei @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman Vlad may end up below the production of an 80 hit tool. You seem unable to acknowledge that possibility, which is one primary source of the problem here. As I dislike arguing with inanimate objects, I'm done here.
@BenZwei Liked, didn't love.
@bryanarthur @BenZwei @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman And an "80 grade hitter," a subjective evaluation, would be the 100% scenario for Vlad, as you describe it. So, again, you choose the best possible outcome for one player, but not for the other. Seems fair.
@AlexFast8 oh, sure, although I haven't seen him since he left for Korea
@JohnWick38104 well you need wrist strength and flexibility for a proper CB and Stewart has an exceptional one

@bryanarthur @BenZwei @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman Lot of wrong here, not least is that it's 14 runs if you think he's a 1B, which he's almost certainly not. 20 is a better ballpark on this. And even if it's, say, 15 runs of position, then add defense and baserunning and you're still asking Vlad's to be at least 20-25 runs better
when my daughter was born, we did the free neonatal screening offered by the state, and she came up positive for 3MCC, an organic acidemia. It's rare enough that the state asked to test my genes and her mom's. I have it too and her mom's a carrier (it's autosomal recessive). https://t.co/JZcctPIhFA
@bryanarthur @BenZwei @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman The position value adjustment for one season for a SS and a 1B is 20 runs, according to Fangraphs. It's 25 runs for SS vs DH. I'm being generous, even though Vlad is almost certainly a DH given his size and current defensive skills.
@caleb_kearney @JakeRemus49 @Tim_Curtis And Jake's whine isn't even accurate.
@ThaGreatOne99 Thanks. I’ve seen a ton of Florial in particular and am very confident I have him evaluated properly.
@bryanarthur @BenZwei @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman Then your “feeling” is false.
@BenZwei @bryanarthur @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman It’s about 20 runs if we just assume Tatis is an average SS, which might be conservative. And that’s before considering baserunning value (Tatis is good, Vlad isn’t) or how their bodies might age and hold up.
@BenZwei @bryanarthur @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman Based on fandom, largely, and ignoring all the non-hitting factors that go into evaluating what a prospect's value might be over a career.
@ThaGreatOne99 @FisherCats @BaseballAmerica @MLBPipeline OH MY GOD I'VE BEEN WRONG IN THE PAST
@Sassowned Weird, I literally just wrote two sentences on him for next week's Mets report - as in, I wrote it within the last five minutes.
@BenZwei @bryanarthur @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman https://t.co/05kt0VOndo
@bryanarthur @BenZwei @TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman It’s not a 100% outcome for Tatis.
@BraveTart @seriouseats greek yogurt is so good for baking. I use it in place of sour cream and sometimes buttermilk in recipes so I don’t waste half a container of those ingredients
@KrashKraemer @TheTonyFiorigli @KindaClarkKent You keep treating them like gospel, referring to them as facts or evidence, when they're not. I recall projection systems having similar trouble with Matt Wieters when he destroyed the high minors. And projection systems don't address position, defense, baserunning, body type.
@KrashKraemer @TheTonyFiorigli @KindaClarkKent That's not what projection systems tell us. Projections project - they do not say what IS, but what is likely to be. And projection systems have ranges of outcomes, with wider error bars when the data only comes from the minors. They are not gospel, nor are their outputs facts.
@WPaladino19 @Baseball_Wise @ShrekMetsOgre @joker5339 @AnthonyDiComo @MLBPipeline @BaseballAmerica @baseballpro Well, you can ask and learn, or simply shut out what "doesn't make too much sense" to you.
@TheTonyFiorigli @rzhallman @bryanarthur @BenZwei love to say "30/30 GMs would do X" when you've never talked to a single GM 😂
@thedukesharon Ah yes. I have heard from readers that if you sign up using a VPN and select digital delivery of the magazine you can subscribe.
@thedukesharon why can’t you access it?
@bryanarthur @BenZwei That’s quite a strawman. I can’t speak to what other publications are doing. I know, as I pointed out in my chat, that the difference between a league average defensive SS and a DH is about 20 runs right off the bat, and Tatis may be more than just avg on defense.

@kittypurrzog @TheStranger FWIW, and I know you don't write the headlines, these people are not "skeptics." They are deniers, or denialists. Skeptics demand evidence before accepting something. Anti-vaxxers reject evidence in favor of false beliefs. Calling them "skeptics" validates their nonsense.

@MaxGold81356590 @isaacfromCT @accfanto I know what it is. I'm saying I don't see it as evidence of anything. Execs and scouts from all over the league saw my list, and the majority came back and agreed with Tatis at 1. You can disagree, but don't tell me the league and I overvalue position.
@LttleGel @lindseyadler yep, great piece. I don't include a lot of subscriber-only articles on my saturday link roundups but I included that one.
@MaxGold81356590 @isaacfromCT @accfanto You'd have to ask them. I don't write for other sites. And I have no idea why you're treating that "prospect valuation system" as meaningful.
@LttleGel @lindseyadler I agree. I mentioned Lawson in my writeup of Florial. Lindsey wrote a great profile of Lawson last week - I assume that's why you mentioned him.
@matthew_botteon @alexrene216 love the complaints from someone who's never seen the player or asked a single scout about him!

@ShrekMetsOgre @joker5339 @AnthonyDiComo @MLBPipeline @BaseballAmerica @baseballpro Well, if you still use OPS - a deeply flawed stat for an individual hitter that overweights slugging - and don't realize Las Vegas is an extreme hitter's park, I'm not surprised you don't understand.
@RustyPriske Who says it's "generally accepted wisdom?" You haven't talked to sources. You haven't scouted the players. It's simply not - and to say it makes "literally zero sense" when I gave a rational explanation is insulting.

@iDontHoldHouses He's almost certainly a DH.
@iDontHoldHouses I think you're confused. I'm not projecting what teams will do, but what the players are capable of doing.
@Redsshine09 @BPC2431 @ctrent wRC+ of 97 is below average, by definition. OPS sucks as an individual stat and isn't park-adjusted, which you need to do for a strong hitter's park like GABP.
@randalgraves79 The #1 prospect is at #1. I could not possibly care less about being "hip." I evaluate players myself, and have been doing so for over a decade, and then circulate my list to scouts and execs. I stand by the ranking 100%.
@ReivajJavier2 @SShermanRacing I don't care about what "other outlets" say. My information is solid. He absolutely belongs where I have him.
@BurnieW51 He was in Monday's column.
@matlinsb no
@ReivajJavier2 @SShermanRacing Fathom harder, I guess?
@BPC2431 @ctrent He was a below-average hitter last year - 97 wRC+. You want to die on this hill, go for it. I have rankings to write.
@swwrightson No.
@topskrizzles Correct, he is not on there, or close.
@SShermanRacing correct
@davebarr34 He does not. Rookie status is the criterion.
@BPC2431 @ctrent no. I received a lot of angry messages from Reds fans when I left Peraza off my top 100 after the trade.

@nicholasberger @owenpoindexter I disagree, but both are great.
@cispt2 @stephaniekays I'd love to know why @Jerusalem_Post ran this nonsense
@SBriend97 @big_nate5 @DanTorrenti the nonchalant “got him” is my favorite part
@EvanScherr @SBriend97 @big_nate5 @DanTorrenti i’ve seen it and @longenhagen saw 102

@ndycarrier my #3 movie of 2018
@BenZwei It’s fine but of foreign films this year it’s probably at the bottom for me
@BryceSnape @SouthSideSox I wasn't on him before the draft
@ABabip those are both in my top ten as well
@MarkLikesMovies @LanceBroz Never Look Away is 188 minutes long. Probably gonna wait on streaming for that. But the Birds of Passage trailer looked amazing.
@peacecorpdad i haven't
@MarkLikesMovies @LanceBroz yep, liked Cold War more than Capernaum, less than Burning-Roma-Shoplifters.
@ABabip those are 3 and 1 for me
@NickNelson87 @Crawford_MILB hi I hate you both
@LanceBroz I saw it in november in a theater
Burning &gt; Capernaum.
@DrMike5150 @FLMetsFan @VFL_Hinton either this dude thinks banner ads pay way better than they do or he thinks espn pays me peanuts
@thejd44 He’s better than that.
@SouthSideSox what a lovely review. Thank you.
@therealjpump @AdamSerwer well adam is right about good coffee
@j_whipp13 @Kris_Willis that is correct
@calebgoodman91 why not? I think the capsule explains it well.
@BenZwei @realDailyWire imagine thinking this was some sort of own
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 Okay, so it appears you decide what is ethical. Got it.
@realDailyWire where do I sign up
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 According to you? Teaching creationism in a public school is extremely unethical, since it is absolutely false, not to mention that it invites an expensive lawsuit the school district will lose.
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 They’re functionally equivalent for this conversation. The holocaust happened and evolution is still happening. If a teacher believes either is a “controversial theory” and wants to teach “challenging ideas,” why won’t you let them?
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 The bill would allow alternatives to “controversial theories” - which includes proven theories like evolution.
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 There is nothing wrong with challenging ideas; there is something very wrong with using taxpayer-funded education to teach bullshit. Climate change denial, anti-vax, false flags, creationism, Holocaust denial - keep it all out of public schools.
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 I do understand, pal. I understand you're a denier.
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 Hilarious. That Florida bill would allow pseudoscience, religion, and denialism to be taught in public schools. If you run a public school, and think that's okay, then tell us what schools instead of hiding behind a pseudonym.
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 right, anonymous guy on the internet who claims he "runs schools" says the global scientific community is wrong. https://t.co/4x12oJKmMT
@JFLANland I'm not taking questions on the top 50 until it runs. Sorry.
@MaxHouseholder @HooDooKoo Because of the evidence that you keep ignoring here. People who thought the earth was flat did so because they had no way to directly observe anything. We can see the climate changing, and the changing composition of the atmosphere, and how increased CH4 or CO2 changes climate.
@BatFlip1 @Moses0507 1. i don't know why you put "facts" in "quotes"  2. there are no other facts or evidence when it comes to evolution or anthropogenic climate change. Evolution is real. Creationism and its corollaries are not.
@BrandedBets @tylerdonchez I specifically looked for this reply.
@BatFlip1 @emykleby You keep claiming you run schools. What schools do you run?
@BatFlip1 @emykleby what schools do you run?
@HelloNuman https://t.co/lI6qIBaX68
@KindaClarkKent @LAHoss24 @dan_scooby Horribly. Nor does he seem to know what my job is, what "professional" entails, or the extent to which I give a shit what some rando thinks about me.
@Your_Pal_Billy @ParkerMolloy whoa whoa whoA WHOA
@MaxHouseholder @HooDooKoo "The point I was trying to make is that teaching climate change, aside from it's broadest definition, as settled fact is as ridiculous as teaching that the Earth is flat."  no, it's not. It's so very, totally, thoroughly, utterly NOT. How can you even compare those two?
@ParkerMolloy I don’t even play video games and I got the joke
@LAHoss24 @dan_scooby Griffey was the player most often held up as 'clean' by writers who decried allegedly 'dirty' players like Bagwell or Bonds.  Again, do you have a point here?
@MaxHouseholder @HooDooKoo @M_Insero26 https://t.co/IJfLzU7LhW
@MaxHouseholder @HooDooKoo @M_Insero26 Playing the victim now? You said there's value in "alternative theories." What is Holocaust denial if not an "alternative theory" like creationism, climate denial, or false flag beliefs?
@Sports70 This is untrue. We have seen evolution occur - MRSA is the result of evolution. Read The Beak of the Finch for observed evolution in multiple finch species. We see it everywhere. If you wish to deny it, you may, but you are wrong, and we are all worse off for that.
@KindaClarkKent @LAHoss24 @dan_scooby while holding a grudge over a tweet that is over three years old.
@anthonytraurig You’re welcome. I always consider risk and probability.
@anthonytraurig @Louie80226291 @Kris_Willis FTR, my method is totally different than MLB's or BA's. I like those guys, we're even friends, but we don't go about these lists the same way.
@LAHoss24 @dan_scooby I get no benefit from people "clicking" on my tweet. There is nothing to bait.  As for Griffey, he was related. He was on the Hall ballot that year, and there were many articles extolling him as clean, even though we can't possibly know such a thing.
@HooDooKoo @MaxHouseholder @M_Insero26 Max's argument is also a good way to bring Holocaust denial into schools. Teach the debate!
@MaxHouseholder @SciencelsLife @thejd44 @M_Insero26 That is a serious misstatement of the consensus, bordering on ignorance.
@LAHoss24 @dan_scooby What click? You can’t bait if there’s nothing to click. Do you have a point here?
@Kris_Willis @Louie80226291 @anthonytraurig Completely fair. But shoulder + delivery i’ve never loved is IMO a valid and tangible reason to slide a guy down
@MaxHouseholder @SciencelsLife @thejd44 @M_Insero26 This entire tweet is evidence that you don't really know what climate change or climate science entail. Maybe trust the experts, who are nearly unanimous in their view: The evidence proves that the planet's climate is warming &amp; the oceans becoming more acidic, and it's our fault.
@BatFlip1 uh, i don't think you know what 'freethinkers' means ... and no school that uses public funds should be teaching bullshit like creationism or climate change denial
@Tatolote Yeah, but I don't follow you. And you have no idea why people follow me. Goodbye.
@LAHoss24 @dan_scooby Well, that tweet was rational, and I think made the point desired rather well: We make assumptions about players based on no evidence at all, but on personal feelings.
I've gotten a few questions about Soroka's ranking, so a quick answer - shoulder injuries are a big red flag for me with any pitcher https://t.co/7i1NcXZcDu
@Moses0507 @MaxHouseholder @jobprospectsguy @M_Insero26 Also, Max is flipping the question. The bill proposes allowing teachers to teach bullshit, like creationism or climate denial. There is no bill or law here preventing teachers from teaching something.
@MrCoachRentz I was taught in junior high school around 1985 that that was a myth - that natives were here first and the Vikings arrived here in the 900s.
@FLMetsFan ew complainer
@Tatolote So, you tell someone you have never met how to run his personal twitter account, multiple people tell you you're wrong to do so, and your response is ... to insult us? Grow up.
@MaxHouseholder Or you lacked the same personal initiative you ascribed to students who'd learn on their own that their teachers were wrong.
@MaxHouseholder Wrong. Classic denialist error. https://t.co/txtdY22xcc
@Tatolote I'll take it for what it's worth to me, which is nothing.
"Let teachers teach the earth is flat if they want to," is a hell of a way to run an education system https://t.co/wYDGRyucsz
@KenLavin91 Don't care. I've seen him and confirmed it with scouts. He's not a 60 runner, full stop.
@KenLavin91 I saw him in July and got two average run times for him. And I confirmed this with multiple scouts. Your “info” is wrong.
@KenLavin91 You said my info was “old.” I tell you it’s new, and now you find another reason to discard it? Sure.
@MaxHouseholder No, you didn’t mention scientific theories. You listed hypotheses that failed once we had evidence to examine them. A scientific theory has been proven.
@Sports70 No, facts, proven by evidence. Everything else is denialism.
@KenLavin91 no, they are not, nor are they “takes.” I just scouted Gimenez again in the AFL.
@Sports70 no, so it is. You may be in denial, but these are the facts.
@MaxHouseholder and by the way, it’s not that i believe they’re settled - they are settled.
@MaxHouseholder That’s not even remotely close to what this bill proposes. You’re either being disingenuous or you haven’t read about this topic at all.
@Sports70 That’s a red herring. Evolution and climate change are real. There is no controversy and no “alternative theories.”
@scott_pianowski Humidity is at the top
@MaxHouseholder These are facts, not “controversial ideas.”

@AnAverageGatsby no sorry, i don't have any recs
@zmotalk @tlschwerz how many scouts did you talk to about this
@Hamptonian10 @Kris_Willis @TalkingChop Except you're not. I never said the player "sucks," never said he doesn't have offensive value. Go back under your bridge.
@Hamptonian10 @Kris_Willis @TalkingChop You've already moved the goalposts. Please show me where I said he "sucks." Thanks.
@WalterWhiteball He was on yesterday’s post of guys who just missed
@Hamptonian10 @Kris_Willis @TalkingChop No, I have never said any such thing. Stop trolling.

@aaronburkart Torching or simply not praising?

@CinemaFetish hat tip to my friend @lindseyadler who wrote a great story for The Athletic on Lawson this month
@Gen_Con Fred. #namedragon #okaymaybenot
@Matt_Holcombe @burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio He used a slur for gays and a slur for developmentally disabled people. Those words haven't been "acceptable" to use in decades, if ever.
@Matt_Holcombe @burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio No, you're trolling. Merrifield used a slur, a word that begins with 'f.' The tweet you keep bringing up, because you're trolling, uses a different word. How hard is this?
@admiralNELS11 @KindaClarkKent doesn't matter if it was a friend, and those tweets were already outed this past summer
@Matt_Holcombe @burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio BTW, he tweeted that *after* I blocked him.
@Matt_Holcombe @burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio no, it didn't. Is that your burner account?
@Matt_Holcombe @burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio No, I blocked him (them?) for trolling and for defending bigotry.
@Mbifulco94 @trey_willard @ELJGON and I've been pretty clear that there are many times I'd prefer less attention, not more
@admiralNELS11 Yeah, it's a big deal. Go ask any LGBTQ friend of yours if it's a big deal. And by the way, 9 years ago = he was still an adult.
@JoshDeFamio @burneraccount_0 blocked him, just another troll
@trey_willard @ELJGON how will i ever recover from this
@admiralNELS11 A lot of people. You don't, which I think says something about you, and how you feel about folks who aren't like you.
@burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio because Merrifield wasn't in the majors at the time. This isn't hard.
@_bkuhn_ pardinho's a pitcher. Those are position players.
@trey_willard @ELJGON so sorry to inconvenience you
@_bkuhn_ thanks - what's this referring to?
@burneraccount_0 @JoshDeFamio That wasn't acceptable slang 20 years ago.
@JoshDeFamio is bigotry the soul of whit?
@tberger87 @jonandersenn by fans? the media? maybe his employer? come on. let’s not shed tears for the privileged white man who said bigoted things.

@teewhy_ward the whole schedule is in the article, right next to the Florial blurb
@alwaysbeebetter @Dooch2009 I appreciate the kind words, but where I work is a function of much greater variables than that, such as what is right for my daughter, and how I'm compensated for my work.
@AnalyticsPlant that's realer than real deal Holyfield
@chrispic88 Yes, I think that's dead on. I'd even say the tools to be an above-average regular.
@FontMax there's never been a hitter drafted from a NH high school who's made the majors. So, unless there was someone prior to the draft era, then yes.

@MarcusT313 @joelbrady Minors can be cheap to attend, even compared to other forms of entertainment, and when two tickets might cost you $10-12 it's not unusual to think to bring or pay cash
@joelbrady yes, in general this is a huge issue. However, I'm not sure if that will affect very many people at MLB games. Minors, much more likely.

as a Long Island native I was unaware LaGuardia could get any worse
@HerringLiz @ThePeskyPole This is disingenuous. Nobody is talking about "conservative" here. Baseball is full of white men who have wealth and didn't finish college, a group statistically very likely to vote Republican. The one person we're talking about has made a series of bigoted comments.

Today's Klawchat transcript: https://t.co/NB8QF9IEtC
@EricDetweiler no
@KenTremendous just here to stan for Rosamund Pike because of “A Private War” thanks. also fruit pies are delicious.
@TMarsh88 Forbidden Island would fit. Mole Rats in Space works too but might feel too much like it’s for younger kids.
@lizconsin when I saw that at Gen Con I started giggling like a little kid. It's so dorky and retro that it's just wonderful. Also really f'n hard to beat - harder than Island, maybe a shade below Desert.
@Rmm800 Out of my control, unfortunately.
@ericmcclung @audubonsociety @elizhargrave yep, I'm on the review copy list whenever the second printing hits
@bdelbanco very much so
My latest game review for Paste Magazine covers Forbidden Sky, the latest co-op title from Pandemic designer Matt Leacock, this time with a STEM twist: https://t.co/Gn5xmzYSsz
@crookedtimber25 @chakrabortty He's not "my favorite economist." FOH.
@stephaniekays OH MY GOD
@kenkiebles13 @Buster_ESPN invaluable feedback, thanks
Klawchat today at 1 pm ET: https://t.co/NB8QF9IEtC
in which I tell @Buster_ESPN I think Pollock is close to signing with someone and he says probably the Dodgers... https://t.co/NsQx7Q0nsW
@davidktobin @jakeofohio92 Good talk.
@herrrpunkt It's not out in the US yet. The trailer was gorgeous, but 3 hours may exceed my ability to sit in one place.

@KashChristophe1 @Yanks23242 First of all, stop tagging the players. I will not answer you if you do that again.   Second, pitcher wins and batting average are not good ways to evaluate players. We have far better tools at our disposal today. Mussina pitched in a higher run-scoring environment than TJ did.
@TacoAffcionado @KatieKatCubs @ChrisTweetLLC https://t.co/6woEMwAvVZ
@TacoAffcionado accurate
@HunterFelt Yep. Auto block for me. https://t.co/ZFdptiRAIt
@minakimes https://t.co/BS4LdaX4FN
@creedreader @joshgondelman @akmcquade i’m in the “bug” camp on this one
@KashChristophe1 Their numbers as a whole are not better. We are certainly long past evaluating a hitter by his batting average.
@BenjaminEckhoff it’s not even a political opinion but you do you
@jdarnbro can’t wait for the videos of people cutting up their hats or something
@matthew_botteon nope
@joshgondelman @akmcquade some people view that as a feature rather than a bug
and especially gross since it’s a play on “I am the Love that dare not speak its name,” a line from poet Lord Alfred Douglas that alluded to homosexuality and its illicit status in England at the time https://t.co/9ndynxCJto

@AJontheguitar @PabloTorre @TimCowlishaw my #brand is strong
@LyleGordon1 @chasestrangio you’re welcome!
@LyleGordon1 @chasestrangio So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo is outstanding (although I disagree with her chapter on rap as cultural appropriation, still great though)  Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People by Banaji &amp; Greenwald (more academic, so a bit less fun to read, but insightful)
@DrBobCaldwell @_JeremyBooth @ProspectInsider @spencer_711 @Racerman967 @tromblybaseball @JBristolKHOU I'd also add to that Bonds' superb defense in LF. He doesn't get a lot of credit for how good he was out there, I think because we used to think "power hitter" = "bad defender."
@LyleGordon1 @chasestrangio OK that's just silly.
@LyleGordon1 You are mistaken on this, and if you'd like, I can suggest several books for you to read on the subjects of implicit and explicit bias.
@LyleGordon1 I did not.
@DSzymborski @RyanQDavis @TheOriginalBull oh please, Tony Abreu might be a better candidate than Baines. Baines as precedent is "put 'em all in."
@DSzymborski is he really good enough though? or just “better than we thought but still not a HoF?”
I remember a player we had in Toronto, as a prospect, from the DR. The player dev coaches joked that he didn't even speak Spanish, as if his dialect &amp; lack of education were some personal failing. (He reached the majors with another org.) https://t.co/aSRvbk2pn0
@davidktobin @jakeofohio92 Ozzie, Simmons, Belanger, Ripken, Tulo prior to injury. Rey Sanchez was incredible when he played. Adam Everett too. Would put their gloves all over Vizquel's.
@davidktobin @jakeofohio92 Bleacher Report? No.
@TacoAffcionado https://t.co/ZloqduiXBl
@MrEricHansen yep, it's wonderful for that very reason
I think MLB is better at this today, ~25 years later, but nowhere near where it needs to be in helping players from non-Anglophone countries adjust to life here. https://t.co/haIT1BpIc3
@davidktobin @jakeofohio92 No, I did not. And Vizquel isn't the 2nd best shortstop, defensive or overall, in MLB history.
@Andreworld88 @Yanks23242 I would have answered anyway because I don't think pro-yankee bias mattered here. There was a very strong analytical case for Rivera.
@Yanks23242 @Andreworld88 yeah, a "fringe HoFer" would be someone who gets in near the end of his time on the ballot
@Kwame_F It can only be a positive for me. Never held against a player
@cullycat1 @AnalyticsPlant @stengelsghost @MichaelSalfino The economic thinking on minimum wage increases has been changing in light of empirical evidence from such hikes as Seattle’s.
everything is fine https://t.co/M44sE05J2F
@DETsportschat @KennySledge no Manning is a mistake.
@Andreworld88 Sure. Everyone needs a bad hill to die on.
@cullycat1 @stengelsghost @MichaelSalfino Zero chance of that happening. Switching costs for them would far outweigh added costs of salary.
@Mhyman32 My prospect rankings go up next week.
@Andreworld88 You, at first: "Put him in a Marlins Jersey, and I’d be willing to bet he’s a fringe HOF at best"  You, now: https://t.co/HqZqEhpl28
@cullycat1 @stengelsghost @MichaelSalfino Whether you "buy it" is irrelevant to whether it's true. The argument from personal incredulity is a fallacy.
@cullycat1 @stengelsghost @MichaelSalfino they average over 6 per franchise, Dave. Some of us here have spent years in the industry and know more about its economics.
@Andreworld88 Rivera is the all-time leader in ERA+, park-adjusted ERA scaled to league-average, at 205. There is no way the baseball world today fails to recognize that player even if he spends his career with the most obscure team in baseball.
@Andreworld88 Yes, I have a hidden talent into seeing alternative realities. You really don't want to hear what I saw in yours.  We have team-independent stats to evaluate players, and using those, Rivera was still the best ever at his particular role by as wide a margin as I've ever seen.
@djeterg19 that's what i keep reading on my internet. (love your background, btw)
@Andreworld88 No way.
@cullycat1 @MichaelSalfino Minor league baseball is profitable.
@davidktobin @jakeofohio92 Ozzie just made a lot more plays, period.
Highly profitable, billion-dollar companies do not want to pay workers a few extra dollars an hour. Film at 11. https://t.co/p27bPFfQPl

@gowanusbaseball Edmonds yes, Lofton not sure.
@mackay_rod @maguire1166 There's only been one vote taken away for cause, and that was because the writer gave his vote to Deadspin for its readers to fill out.
@MD_Rossetti His case is not airtight but I can't possibly see omitting him. There aren't ten better players on the ballot, or close to it, and he's also well over the line for shortstops even if you think his defense was execrable
@Mussina_HOF @StreakingIndian Did it help push Mo to 100%? Halladay? I think it does help some players but that we discuss or notice it less
I didn't, because I promised readers a while back I would vote for my top 10. But I wouldn't criticize anyone who cast a strategic ballot, because the 10-name limit is arbitrary and capricious. https://t.co/ordshMENlm
@mackay_rod @maguire1166 Um, yeah. There's so much wrong with your last sentence I don't even know where to start.
@UCSBGaucho @MiddleAgedJoker I agree with you that the tradition needed to end
@ManuclearBomb It's not anecdotal. Scan the public ballots.
@RustyPriske I think the backlog clearing will help Walker most of all, maybe Rolen (yes) and Vizquel (no)
@MiddleAgedJoker @UCSBGaucho that's exactly how I feel. Same plaque for 75% or 100%.
@SriramofNorwell agreed
@spowell82nd @mikeagogliati https://t.co/ajk2ricoNb
@crouses @DavidEberly @originaluyf1950 @Ken_Rosenthal No, it's a myth. I know, having worked in a front office. They haven't lost any pitcher where they were the high bidder. You want a stud pitcher? Bid more than anyone else.
@spowell82nd @mikeagogliati Thank you. I just didn’t understand the plug comment but we’re good.
@spowell82nd @mikeagogliati Sure. You made a bad argument that others have made before. I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work to craft the best possible rebuttal to it. I’m not sure why you’d expect me not to direct people there.
@Marlow28 @thesega @TylerBrietzke @KevinMcAlpin @680TheFan (psssst protection isn't real)
@DebSeymour51 yes, that's accurate
@spowell82nd @mikeagogliati As a measure of individual performance, yes, RBI and Runs Scored are irrelevant. They don't tell you anything useful. There's a whole chapter explaining why in my book.
@SethAtkinson4 @j_o_cannon I don't agree, BTW.
@CWR4 @j_o_cannon Thanks. Rivera's postseason performance kind of rules them all, though.
@dlishhhh @mikeagogliati Nope. Don't see any tantrum but yours. Quiet now - adults are talking.
@j_o_cannon I think the lowest WAR on my ballot was Andruw Jones or Sheffield
@dlishhhh @mikeagogliati Like, you don't even follow me, but went out of your way to throw a tantrum in my replies, in a discussion I was having with someone else. I'm not the 'salty' one here.
@tomservo50 it's in downtown Philly now, so I assume it's across the country in art theaters
@BradleyHernley not that close though
@dlishhhh @mikeagogliati No salt, just facts.
@thehindu19 @ChoochCast You cited the "eye test" when you haven't spent a day in the industry. That's a self-own, pal.
log off https://t.co/AWUiBVKmRs
@tomservo50 they're my 1-2-3, and I just saw Cold War which is itself pretty damn good.
@mikeagogliati Bagwell destroys McGriff. 31 points of OBP, for starters. That's a huge gulf.
@jaxisking07 @sapjfoofan3511 @patmhickey @ja73193023 first you'd have to learn to read
@Schieslmynizzle @MikeMitchNH oh this? https://t.co/5bZs1rbBDX
@jaxisking07 @sapjfoofan3511 @patmhickey @ja73193023 you're short a few zeroes, sparky
@_JeremyBooth @ProspectInsider @spencer_711 @Racerman967 @tromblybaseball @JBristolKHOU yeah but McGriff played the position with the highest replacement level, so he gets a little bump vs Edgar (DH has an even higher R level) but not that much.  FWIW, on a ballot without a limit, I would have voted McGriff this year, but he was not in my top 12.
@mikeagogliati Other than Hoffman, whose election was a farce, nobody has gotten in via the BBWAA with a lower career value than McGriff.
@sapjfoofan3511 @patmhickey @jaxisking07 @ja73193023 The shame is that you have so little idea what you're talking about that you made a comment on an unrelated issue from 2011 in a 2019 discussion about the Hall of Fame. You lost. Night! https://t.co/p9ddyWMe4C
@_JeremyBooth @ProspectInsider @spencer_711 @Racerman967 @tromblybaseball @JBristolKHOU doesn't matter. Edgar produced more while making fewer outs. Those outs are what keep McGriff's WAR and offensive stats at a level that folks didn't vote for him.
@sapjfoofan3511 @patmhickey @jaxisking07 @ja73193023 Except that's not what I said, troll. Your memory sucks.
@jaxisking07 @patmhickey @sapjfoofan3511 my ballot is public. try the google
@jaxisking07 @patmhickey @sapjfoofan3511 https://t.co/oVaXlnDgfm
@mikeagogliati McGriff made 1300 more outs at the plate. RBI are irrelevant as they're a function of your lineup, not your bat.
@_JeremyBooth @ProspectInsider @spencer_711 @Racerman967 @tromblybaseball @JBristolKHOU Outs: Edgar 5043, McGriff 6338.
@sapjfoofan3511 @patmhickey @jaxisking07 @ja73193023 No, I did not. Good try, troll.
@thehindu19 @ChoochCast The "eyeball test" ... like scouting? the thing I do for my job, and have for over 12 years already? That test? It says Mussina was better.
@webjr1981 i get some ridiculous comments on my movie posts/reviews
@bravesjh1981 by the numbers, yes
@patmhickey @sapjfoofan3511 @jaxisking07 I voted for Rolen. He was an easy 'yes' for me. A dominant defender with plenty of offensive value too.
@StreakingIndian The guidelines explicitly include "character." They leave it to the voter to define it.
@markdoubt2 is that Pingu?
@expos_exposed I voted for him.
@jakeofohio92 I will not vote for him.
@webjr1981 dammit, they're on to me
@MikeMitchNH did not vote for him
@VirginiaYankee1 voted for him
Just glancing at next year's ballot, Jeter is the only definite yes, four guys just got in, and McGriff exhausted his eligibility. There *might* be fewer than 11 worthy players for the first time I can remember.
@americantrama https://t.co/QPAov6EtK7
@EveryDouchebag this tweet was epic
well, Jeter wasn't unanimously elected because he hasn't been on the ballot yet https://t.co/FgHPqoKt1d
@matlinsb no, he's probably a lost cause.
@JasonJwill98 @kateefeldman if you look at my discussion with Kate it should answer your question. I did consider it for him and Bonds, and similar issues for Clemens.
@ChoochCast @ajg6882 @baseballhall @MrBrianKenny @jonmorosi @KeithOlbermann *couldn’t
@ChoochCast @ajg6882 @baseballhall @MrBrianKenny @jonmorosi @KeithOlbermann Hm. What front office did you work for?
@kateefeldman Your second sentence mirrors my thinking precisely.
@lmccormick87 @kateefeldman The whitewashing - or the male analogue - is a real problem for all these guys. Bobby Cox comes to mind. We know he abused his wife, and that isn’t part of his legacy in the least.
@WhitneyM02 @kellyawallace TOO LATE
@kateefeldman Would you vote for Bonds or Clemens?
@kateefeldman Sorry, I did not mean to imply you were suggesting removing players.
@kateefeldman I hear that. I’ve tried to do so with active players. I feel like removing such players from the field for longer stretches of time, or forever, can have a meaningful impact. And I know some GMs worry about backlash today that didn’t exist five years ago.
@OmarMinayaFan @kateefeldman The character clause has long been used for good and bad reasons. And the Hall has never clarified if that means on-field character or all character. I’ve generally, but not universally, interpreted it as on-field. Kate disagrees and I respect her opinion.
@lmccormick87 @kateefeldman Well, I think most folks in “our” camp would prefer a WAR leaderboard to the previous way of doing it. But as I said, I’m listening. This is far from a binary issue in my mind.
@lmccormick87 @kateefeldman Thanks. no offense taken BTW. I did ask myself the same question, and then balanced this (Andruw is probably just a bad person, period) against the enormous positive influence he had on the sport. He’s an icon in Aruba &amp; Curaçao and helped spur this wave of players from there.
@kateefeldman I guess I interpret the pedestal differently - it recognizes the best players, who were frequently not the best people. Frequently they were terrible people (Andruw had more than just the DV accusation, IIRC). Bonds, Clemens, a few I shouldn’t name come to mind.
@lmccormick87 @kateefeldman Not sure if that was to me or Kate, but of course I’ll think on it. I run into the same issue with Bonds, whose ex-wife accused him of frequent abuse, and yet whose on field record clearly merits inclusion. Does the plaque celebrate the man, or merely the player?
@Mussina_HOF watcha gonna do now
@PabloTorre @TimCowlishaw (taps mic) Ahem.
@kateefeldman Thanks. As much as I loathe these men as people, and would never employ them or cheer a team for doing so, I have a hard time reconciling the purpose of the Hall with considerations like these. But I appreciate the response.
@kateefeldman Not at all. So you would withhold a vote for any candidate with a DV on his record?
@kateefeldman I care. Bonds was accused of it too. But is that a criterion for the Hall? Is this an evaluation of the player’s career? I wouldn’t employ such a player in any capacity, but this isn’t a job, just an evaluation of history.
@seanq he said he wasn’t voting
@TJRamsey44 @terrykack23 Ok, my bad. Sorry about that, i misunderstood. I don’t view paying a player and putting on the roster in the same light as evaluating a player’s career.
@TJRamsey44 @terrykack23 I’m not campaigning for Reyes to go in the Hall. Is this some kind of gotcha nonsense?
@KlawThoughts @wheeler_josh well, one thing did change 😢
@WilliamPieper We can discuss history but we can’t change it or pretend what happened didn’t.
@terrykack23 @TJRamsey44 Including Bonds (on the ballot) and Bobby Cox.
@TJRamsey44 What do you think you’re missing?
@SethAtkinson4 No, because Hoffman was about half as valuable as Rivera.
@Marlow28 @TylerBrietzke @KevinMcAlpin @680TheFan Yes, they are, although teams are gradually changing this too.
yes revising history is a great idea and never goes badly https://t.co/yZs7EWa43R
@williamfleitch @karabelleric @molly_knight better than the stupid oscars with their stupid not nominating Burning
also very glad to see Andruw stay on the ballot another year.
Holy %#*&amp;. Never thought anyone would be unanimous.
@AnswerDave @kileymcd @soxmachine_josh you’re thinking of Dementors. They’re all done now.

@EricFrazier2 Couple of things here. One, yes, you must adjust for ballparks, especially since Helton played his whole career as a Rockie. Two, AVG/HR/RBI isn't a good measure of a hitter at all. By wRC+, which is park-adjusted, Sheffield is a good bit better, 141 to 132.

@TacoAffcionado @Crawford_MILB brb looking up the tablature
@TacoAffcionado @Crawford_MILB new fone who dis
@TacoAffcionado @Crawford_MILB here's a partial list: (1/342)
@tberger87 yes, just please stop trading the Downs/Gray caliber
@exhaustedtoo @ThatBoy_GoodRS @TheGrandOldGame 80 WAR - whatever you think of WAR, it's hard to handwave away a total like that, which puts him squarely in the Hall
@BrentStecker @Crawford_MILB it's Chris' favorite song, i learned it this weekend just for him
@tberger87 i understand that too. That pick though - that's how you get Taylor Trammell in your system. And you're going to love him when he gets there.
@Crawford_MILB o hai https://t.co/Aa3NZESq7L
New ESPN+ post - the Reds pick up Sonny Gray from the Yankees and ... is that ... is that Jerry DiPoto's music? https://t.co/v1EIZ527X4
@PaulMittendorff I did and I'm kind of confused TBH
(lights cigar with $10,000 bill) https://t.co/FOxmq4ktZj
@jkrenis I'm not a tiny Hall guy, you are, and that's fine. But Jones is the reason we have players today like Andrelton, Bogaerts, Profar, Jansen, Schoop, and more on the way. He was an absolute superstar to those kids.
@jkrenis no it's fine, i was just asking. https://t.co/RoGh8Mx43A
@jkrenis Rolen is at 70+ WAR for his career, pretty clearly worthy. Did you see the case I laid out for Andruw's importance?
@3262mn @FrankieBalboa happy to reconsider anything, but I'm not arguing with anyone who ranks as a bot on there
@jkrenis no, actually we're putting guys in at a lower rate than in the past when there were fewer teams
@InformedMass ok bot https://t.co/OobSeizgDP
@TacoAffcionado i'm not discussing my day
@LRRSports @DatDudeJD I agree. I made my case for him (yes, in spite of the DV allegation).

@AnswerDave @DerekVanRiper the Mystery Team has no prospects on my list
@heelsonthefield @ctrent oh yeah, i forgot about the gimmick with Rachel &amp; the win total ... ugh.
@biggentleben @jasondeecee 2 or 3
@baseballgods16 they also just traded Josiah Gray to the Dodgers so it works on many levels
@paintingcorner @RP3sViews and then a just missed the just missed the just missed list? it'll be like a Kevin Hart onion!
@jelvig1 excellent i need a prospect list template that basically works like a +1 bag of holding thank you
@TacoAffcionado no, you didn't cut the mustard
@RP3sViews in all seriousness i may go 13 instead of 10 there
@jeremybowers 113 is prime, so it's inherently cool
@ParkerMolloy ok, 112 now
@90feetfromhome only one, i must have made a mistake somewhere here
@molly_knight i heard the NFL has some cool tiebreaker rule
@ctrent @heelsonthefield He stalks her. Like, walks into her apartment, unbidden. That's the worst of it IMO.
I have 113 names for my top 100 prospects ranking right now and I don't really want to cut any more, so if anyone out there knows a good quantum physicist let me know thanks
@JordanUhl @CNNRGLDN I assume it’s pronounced Throat Warbler Mangrove
@baseballgods16 oh that’s good
@RyanGSibley @DavidDagger7 @Lynn_Henning I think the kids behaved far less than perfectly. And several of them wore hats with an offensive slogan that has been used to promote xenophobic policies. NP walking slowly towards them has no bearing on this.
@Mitchel85494817 Oh they do. I don’t though.
@RyanGSibley @DavidDagger7 @Lynn_Henning Ryan: I have seen the unedited video, as have plenty of others who've noticed what I did, such as the Tomahawk Chop and mocking chants from the students.   Also, the account to which I replied was likely a trollbot.
@Mitchel85494817 deal would only die if Reds choose to walk away, no?
@shadeofcardinal they said they asked for it. no idea what happened afterwards. The Commissioner didn't go to the winter meetings so nobody got to ask about it.

@Groovejet21 never seen it, sorry
@KindaClarkKent @ThatBoy_GoodRS @Yanks23242 @TheGrandOldGame I do wonder if social media has influenced voters like that. None of the Griffey non-voters ever revealed their identities.
@LanceHathorn @sajrays10 No, it's a racist gesture. If you can't see that, we're done here.
@LanceHathorn @sajrays10 I think you should read more about what actually happened, and watch that full video to which you referred, the one where the students make a racist gesture and mock chant. Have a great day.
@LanceHathorn @sajrays10 Here's a more novel concept: Read more than just one or tweets from me, to see that I did watch the whole video, and have read multiple, excellent pieces from reliable sources on the matter, and still have the same conclusion.
@Poker_Keith oh man, i'm sorry, you're not the only one and they haven't come up with a solution yet.
@DavidEberly @originaluyf1950 @Ken_Rosenthal The Yankees offer had a higher AAV. And if the third year vests he comes out WAY ahead.
@ThatBoy_GoodRS @Yanks23242 @TheGrandOldGame LOOK AT MEEEEEEEEEEE
@Poker_Keith yes here: https://t.co/V118kKK1h5 I don't rank NPB veterans with prospects, as a policy, since they've played in a major league.
@Yanks23242 @ThatBoy_GoodRS @TheGrandOldGame Shaughnessy wrote he'd never vote for Schilling after that picture ("Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required.")
@DavidEberly @originaluyf1950 @Ken_Rosenthal That's a myth. I agree that baseball's economy is anything but perfect competition, but if the Reds want to sign a FA starter, they have to try actually outbidding other teams, not underbidding and blaming the park.
@librarycongress what day is today yo https://t.co/lSBHf2Rv4a
@ctrent Major League was a favorite of mine at the time but it has aged very, very poorly.
@kellyawallace https://t.co/nMVBWCee6J
@TheGrandOldGame @ThatBoy_GoodRS agreed. plus the newer voters are more likely to ignore W for other stats, which tend to help Mussina a lot and Schilling almost as much.
@Poker_Keith I don't play fantasy so I'm not sure how to help ... Mize was my #1 draft prospect, Kirilloff is also a stud.
I loved this movie. One of the best baseball films I've ever seen. ($) https://t.co/11NQnslets
@fodget Of course. But exhorting voters to vote for someone is useless after the voting has ended.
@ThatBoy_GoodRS @TheGrandOldGame I agree if McGriff got to 500 he would have at least have had far more support. The electorate itself is changing and that should help the next wave of candidates.
@ThatBoy_GoodRS @TheGrandOldGame Voters have been extremely hard on starters the last 10-15 years. I think Schilling is additionally hurt by the character clause, but both he and Mussina were already staring uphill because voters still want 300 W.
@MickPMurray You’re supposed to show the part that advocates violence.
@ThatBoy_GoodRS @TheGrandOldGame I’m pretty sure I voted for several Trump supporters.
@MickPMurray I never acted violence against anyone, and never would. Try again.
@TimGrierson @Zaron3 ahem. (taps mic) https://t.co/btQJvlfN6E
@Matthew_S_Brown @KBO1982 @TheColorBlue88 FWIW I think the video of the kids doing the Tomahawk Chop is clearer and more compelling. I truly can't make out what they're saying, but my hearing has never been that great.
@sajrays10 Good question. I think it's more because he was the one facing Phillips, and thus made for the most compelling photo. The hat did not help. Nor did his facial expression. But I'm saying he's the face of all this, not that smirking = hate.
@DesiJed https://t.co/IBfkyfto2h
@jasonprotzman @NickWalther 300 wins has always been just about automatic induction though. I'm not saying I agree
@Aoki5Chuck I only did once and that was to show how much more valuable he was than Trevor Hoffman, who received far more support. But never just on his own - I’d suggest @jay_jaffe for that
@jasonprotzman @NickWalther That’s before I had a ballot. Also, Glavine had 300 wins.
@LastWordWilliam Yes. Those run during the voting.
@LastWordWilliam He’s exhorting voters to vote for Schilling but the voting is closed.
@Pac_Dozen @AmosPosner I agree
@Omar_Cruz @DatDudeJD I do try to be. Sometimes it’s easy, sometimes not. The weak guidance of the Hall guidelines did not help.
@sajrays10 There’s a lot to unpack there, not least that you seem to be ignoring what we saw the students do. But i’ll ask this: do you disagree that that one student became the face of this incident, and the face people associated with hate, when that photo emerged?
@TheGrandOldGame of course
@lawbibliophile @gfstarr1 https://t.co/jtYEm3c9bV

@ambitiousginger thanks again - last thing, if you see a good piece on this you like, fire it over. saw reason, WaPo, NYT, some blog posts, still absorbing. take care.
@ac13alex oh no they got to you too
@ambitiousginger oh, i got you now. I did see that. Kind of chuckled at Massie decrying homophobic slurs, given his stance on LGBT issues. honestly, I feel like my point stands - this kid's face has been everywhere, and he's going to face consequences right or wrong, no? (also thank you!)
@ambitiousginger btw I'm not sure what thread you meant - I see one that still puts more responsibility on the kids. But I do want to hear what you have to say. Thanks.
@ambitiousginger @KBO1982 @TheColorBlue88 @reason @jaketapper Which position requires amending?
@DrBobCaldwell there's actually very little action in football games, comparable to baseball, but the conversations around both are so divergent
@cjane87 how does MBJ not get a Best Supporting nomination
@BillShaikin I know @BraveTart approves
@robchap17 Thank you, and thank you for continuing this dialogue even when we both started well at odds with each other. Be well.
@robchap17 I truly don't think I was lazy; everything I said is still true. That kid is the face of the whole incident. He's going to face consequences, right or wrong, for a long time. Yet because he wore that hat, and was at that rally, I don't feel much sympathy for him.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please @reason I don't support doxxing either. Nobody in this is accused of a crime. But I did see that smirking kid's (supposed) name &amp; information online earlier. I'm hoping Twitter pulled it.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please @reason I've had quite a few people defend those hats to me today. Even if you don't mean ill by wearing one, the fact that so many people see ill intent in them should deter you.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please Agreed.
@robchap17 Does wearing a MAGA hat make you a racist? I don't know. Maybe. But the slogan itself is racist. It was used, and still is used, to promote a platform of xenophobia, Islamophobia, and outright racism. Choosing to wear that, like wearing a Confederate flag symbol, is problematic.
@Dilly_Special No. But thank you for your service.
@AtlantaLiberal What's fake? Still not really clear on that.
@AtlantaLiberal My emotions were and remain quite real. Not sure about 'fake news,' either. Bisous a toi aussi, mon ami.
@halladayfan32 i'd know that smile anywhere!
@kmh40 @SoCaliSteph @Enrique5150th I have. Thanks for your contribution, though. Invaluable. https://t.co/tPWOW7tFjE
@TacoAffcionado STFU friday!
@AtlantaLiberal Hm, fascinating. How so?
@Russian64584841 That's the price, but not the value.
@nickyahogan @BigBlueAL1980 That turned out to be wrong, although I said earlier, I think it's instructive to know Sanchez wasn't related to Gray's struggles. The ballpark, however, may very well have been the main factor.
@Russian64584841 Agreed - but what is that worth? My argument is that the value of that right is trivial. Maybe it's zero, more likely it's more than zero but not enough to pay more to acquire.
@yeahiroy Phillies have a 6'11" prospect, Kyle Young. Got hurt last year but still hoping to see him in 2019, even just to see it live. Giants just drafted a 6'11" kid, Sean Hjelle, but I thought he didn't make full use of his height just yet.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please You're welcome. I truly thank you for the same. May we all find a bit more common ground.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please @reason I'm still here, still talking to you about it, trying to understand your view even though I don't think I agree with it.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please Looks right. And let's not even get started on what that group was saying.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please I watched the full unedited video I shared earlier. That made it clear.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please @reason I disagree again. Lots of discussion today, pieces arguing for the kids and against them.
@nitro1320 @thomasj0007 @AvlonC @DavidCAvlon @RuthKapelus @piesekdug @dlbno @MeganVictoriaI report him
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please I don’t think that’s accurate. I just rewatched the video. That sounded like a lot of kids.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please @reason But have you not seen many responsible articles and editorials on this today? I listed three I personally read.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please they did do the Tomahawk Chop to him and his compatriots. Is that mockery? I say yes.
@LordActonAFool @mjd_jayhawk94 @jeffrey_feff @speechboy71 also good - this rebuttal to the reason story I mentioned. Layers upon layers. https://t.co/XMhKdT6OKA
@LordActonAFool @mjd_jayhawk94 @jeffrey_feff @speechboy71 Same. People slagged one student’s mom for mislabeling them as “black Muslims” but could we reasonably expect most people to know their group? I read a lot and had no clue.
@adamblindell @rvslaine @RLSTheFirst yep good piece
@mjd_jayhawk94 @jeffrey_feff @LordActonAFool @speechboy71 the Black Hebron group? it does seem like they might be the worst offenders. TBH I’d never heard of them.
@jwillett333 That’s fair. I just find it hard to muster sympathy for people who wear that slogan or march to reduce anyone else’s rights. But I hear you.
@Orangejoe82 @speechboy71 @reason has a piece up that analyzes the longest video of the incident and the writer said no. I actually never heard that either.
@jeffrey_feff @LordActonAFool @speechboy71 this discussion is going way too well for twitter
@jwillett333 Sorry you feel that way.
@LordActonAFool @jeffrey_feff @speechboy71 no but as I said yesterday he became the face of this, and probably still is. Look at all the tweets about his smirk or about wishing to do violence to him. His was the image everyone shared (incl me, with the Beatitudes).
@jeffrey_feff @LordActonAFool @speechboy71 the smirking kid was doxxed earlier today. I don’t know if Twitter removed it but it had thousands of RTs.
@Coresica @Junkfood_Please It is. Lots of people looked further. @reason did. The Washington Post did. The Cincy Enquirer did. I will guess there will be even more stories to come. (I still have no sympathy for the kids in those hats.)
@ParkerMolloy twitter is also not good at shutting this down even though it appears to violate policy
@AnswerDave the OG Rams
@ambitiousginger @KBO1982 @TheColorBlue88 I’m happy to read and learn more from reliable sources (see today’s piece in @reason, which argues that the CC kids were scarcely at fault). But this resembled the anti vaxxer screeds I get - like unsourced screenshots.
@SLuke26 Your parenthetical is a good life policy TBQH
@Greg651 Likewise. Thanks for hearing me out.
@Greg651 Which I accept as a fair criticism. His life won't be the same, likely still for the worse even though further details today paint the kids in a better light. Again, that's what I meant and still mean - he'll be that face people think of and repost every time it comes up.
@LordActonAFool @jeffrey_feff @speechboy71 Nobody should be doxing anyone who isn't a suspect in a crime.
@Greg651 Perhaps, although it's not merely the hat, but the reason he was there. And that's back to my point: If the narrative was wrong, it's too late. He has become that face, and that bell is hard to unring, even before the doxing, which could be dangerous.
@jeffrey_feff @LordActonAFool @speechboy71 I don't hear it - but I don't hear all that well when there's background noise.
@Greg651 In the era of print, that image might end up on the cover of TIME. Now, it just gets retweeted, and someone seems to have doxed him (which, FTR, I don't support, because it's dangerous). We're going to see his smirk repeatedly as an image of hate/white privilege.
@Greg651 I did not feel sympathy for him (hence Lewandowski's "womp womp") because of the slogan on his hat, and the reason he was there. I still don't. But yes, that was a descriptive claim. That smirk will stick to him for years, right, wrong, or in the middle.
@Greg651 Was he not made the face of American hate over the last 36 hours? I doubt he could go anywhere today without being recognized.

@charlierose896 @Ohiovoterbear @jasonpalmowski don't waste your breath, dude's a troll
@originaluyf1950 @dfreeves44 That’s objectively false and also contrary to basic microeconomics. Often you buy things that have more value to you than their price. If the seller has a de facto monopoly, the price will probably exceed the value for most buyers (because it’s set to maximize revenues).
@gilpdawg the point IMO is that catching wasn’t an issue. Maybe the ballpark (but GABP is worse for HR), maybe health, maybe something else, but Sanchez wasn’t it.
@jasonpalmowski https://t.co/8bRo6kqOeL
@dfreeves44 @originaluyf1950 No. The price of something does not reflect its value.
@originaluyf1950 Yes, you have avoided it. The correct answer is that its value is trivial.
@marinjos bad ballpark for him IMO. And maybe not healthy?
credit here to to the excellent Yankees blog @RiverAveBlues https://t.co/4OB4cbd0p0
@fcb814 @RiverAveBlues thank you!
@fcb814 yep that’s what I saw. Hi-larious
@originaluyf1950 You’ve avoided the question. You claim this exclusive negotiating window has value, but won’t say what the value is. I say it has either no value or a value so trivial it shouldn’t affect the deal.
@intothewall https://t.co/U3foGWz4Ku
and yet - sorry, I forgot who tweeted this last night - Romine caught a lot more of Gray’s innings than Sanchez did https://t.co/QF6zBxRbKb
@originaluyf1950 OK. What’s it worth?
@Fgerlando https://t.co/XUxhdBmpLt
@larricontrary I feel like it’s intro to economics stuff.
if the Reds offer more to the Yankees because Gray signed an extension … you’re not acquiring the extension years. You’re acquiring one year. So you pay for the value of that one year.

@Justin_Dyer10 I have.
@Justin_Dyer10 No, that's not a secular education, or even close to the exposure I mean. Good luck to you.
@Justin_Dyer10 I'm not. I'm following published news reports from reliable sources like the Washington Post.  Go spend some time in the world. Maybe get a secular education at some point. Travel. Meet people who don't look like you or think like you. You'll be a better human for it.
@Justin_Dyer10 I have said many times, in many forums, that I acknowledge my privilege, and try to use it to help those who were not born white male straight &amp; cisgender, or who didn't grow up with my economic advantages or couldn't attend an Ivy League school.
@Justin_Dyer10 This went around last night. If you take it at face value, despite the lack of any attribution, then I think the problem here is obvious.
@Justin_Dyer10 Whether you think white privilege is a crazy concept is irrelevant. It exists; it is your choice to accept or deny it.
@Justin_Dyer10 No, I'm judging you as a 19-year-old white male graduate of a Christian prep school, who now attends an evangelical university in TN, and is now claiming the mainstream media "haven't exactly been reliable."
@Justin_Dyer10 That's not accurate. Plenty of news coverage today from reliable sources. You seem to have jumped to believe the side of the boys who look a heck of a lot like you. Privilege is a powerful drug.

@thomasj0007 @RuthKapelus @dlbno @MeganVictoriaI and blocked.
@RuthKapelus It was a statement to the public, to which we can then hold him in the future.  The lack of women and POC in baseball is a major problem. I've done things to help, but more would be better.
@dlbno @piesekdug @MeganVictoriaI If they'd made negative public statements, even just saying he was no longer the closer, they would likely have faced a grievance - and certainly caught hell from his agent. As a former FO whatever I was, I see it that they got rid of the guy as soon as they could.
@dlbno @piesekdug @MeganVictoriaI I do. I don't agree. I think you're oversimplifying this rather than seeing it from the FO's perspective. And I say that as someone who would look to release any such player as soon as it was permitted if I were in that chair.
@dlbno @piesekdug @MeganVictoriaI I'm actually not sure they could have released him before the rehab assignment. The Rockies released Reyes outright but only after he completed his suspension. The Padres DFA'd Oliveira after his suspension too.
@RuthKapelus Most clubs handle this atrociously. Shapiro is one of the only execs I can think of who's taken this public stand. He must follow through, but this is progress, and I believe other execs will be forced to answer ("Mark Shapiro said X, what is your policy?")
@piesekdug @dlbno @MeganVictoriaI You might argue they should have just released him when he was suspended. Since he would have been signed elsewhere anyway, I don't know that that would have had any practical impact on the issue (and maybe Rogers forbade it?).
@RuthKapelus @dlbno @MeganVictoriaI I didn't ask you to applaud. But on a day when the Cubs are going out of their way to welcome back an abuser, four months after the Mets sent an abuser off with a tribute day and have since signed another to a three-year deal, I think Shapiro's statement is a net positive.
@RuthKapelus I wasn't snide. I believe my original tweet was clear (that "them" referred to only the major-league team). I don't believe they had the right to decline to send him out to rehab - it was that or release him.
@WISportsRumen @TwinDaddyNJ @coloradobuffs91 Gray has one year of control remaining before he's a free agent. And in this case, you would compare his projected value to that of whoever he replaces in their rotation - likely Tyler Mahle. The net gain is probably less than a win.
@alex1Litt @ginnysearle "Voting: Voting shall be based upon the player's record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played."
@RuthKapelus @dlbno @MeganVictoriaI He didn't pitch for the major league team again after the arrest &amp; suspension. Better?
@ZachAds @MLB Yes, I did.
@ZachAds @MLB I have ten slots. He wasn't top ten. Once again, politics never entered into it. That is your fabrication. Enjoy your evening.
@WISportsRumen @TwinDaddyNJ @coloradobuffs91 Maybe. I explain it in Smart Baseball. But you don't seem to think a 31% chance of getting a three-year (or more, maybe much more) big leaguer for an investment of a bit over $1 million is a good deal. That's objectively wrong.
@ZachAds @MLB I did not vote for him. Politics are not, and will never be, a criterion for my Hall of Fame ballot.
@ZachAds @MLB nobody here mentioned politics.
@dlbno @MeganVictoriaI He didn't pitch for them again after the arrest &amp; suspension. That puts them at the top tier of MLB teams in how to handle such matters.
@WilliamsAaronC “The perfect deal?” Another strawman. You don’t see the value of the draft pick, fine. But it does have value and this deal doesn’t bring enough value back.
@WilliamsAaronC You’ve moved the goalposts now - and it is hardly clear that Gray improves them now.
@Raezerblade @MLB I only mentioned three or four players I didn’t vote for (I think). The column was getting too long as it was.
@firstpitchmitch @MLB thanks!
@Raezerblade @MLB I did not vote for him.
@ZWnBawlmer he is.
@B_Delach well they had one such player and got rid of him
@firstpitchmitch @MLB my ballot is here: https://t.co/RoGh8Mx43A
@boinkofscience @MLB he’s weighed in on that subject today.
@JasonTrekkie @MLB I know. I said now for a reason
@MLB ok now do Schilling
@WISportsRumen @TwinDaddyNJ @coloradobuffs91 Do you know how expected value works?
@WISportsRumen @TwinDaddyNJ @coloradobuffs91 pick #36 is higher than that. Also, what a misleading stat. If you land an average regular in the second round, you’ve gotten over a 1000% ROI on the pick.   And you continue to ignore the pool value because it undermines your point.
@unspeedyclaxton I hope so but neither side has any real motivation to do so
@unspeedyclaxton it would require a CBA change
@WilliamsAaronC Nobody said prospects were sure things. And they’d be trading the pick for Sonny Gray, who is … not a sure thing.
nope. More picks means more pool money which gives you an advantage in taking the best players - or it means you draft a larger portfolio of prospects. https://t.co/LRyDlvYMCR

@WISportsRumen @coloradobuffs91 You’re still wrong. The 36th pick has seven figures of pool value.
@WISportsRumen Incorrect.

@insanebearman Impossibly? Players are tested for PEDs. Unless you’re arguing that those tests are negated by false positives, I think that’s a clear way to meet the standard.

@Joe_Breez no which is it? Murphy said being gay is a “lifestyle” which is objectively false and also bigoted, so you’re still not making sense here

@C_murphy15 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim Yes he did. Machado was 14th in the majors in WAR in 2018, despite playing 90% of his games out of position.
@C_murphy15 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim here's an actual argument: He was worth 5.7-7.1 WAR three times in the last four years. The one exception was a low BABIP fluke; his contact quality was intact. He's 26 and entering his prime years, and plays a premium position. Spare me your cherrypicked nonsense.

@EJames342 @trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim he's probably a top ten all time player, but I don't think he's seen as such by most people
@trios4fun he’s 18 WAR ahead of where Winfield was at the same age. So yeah, i’ll go out on that limb.
@Lmbclean strawman.
@trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim All of those players produced more value in their careers than Jr except Trout, who is 3/4 of the way to passing Griffey’s total at age 27. And you have no idea if Jr used steroids are not.   You’ve missed a lot of great baseball. Now sssh - adults are talking.
@trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim Mike Trout comes to mind. Alex Rodriguez. Barry Bonds. Rickey Henderson. Adrian Beltre.   Meanwhile, you still whiffed on the subject of this thread. Machado is a way better free agent than 39 year old Griffey. He’s better than 28-year-old Dave Winfield was too.
@Blu32 Rancilio Silvia
@EJames342 @thanksfor1984 @susanslusser I do think that’s his upside but also think his probability is low because he has so few AB to date
@trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim https://t.co/4U05i4oaCM
@trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim At the time of free agency, which was the actual question here, machado is clearly better. And if Griffey is the best player you’ve seen in your lifetime you’ve missed a lot of great baseball.
@trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim Also, Ken Griffey Jr. was a free agent for the first time at age 39, by which time he was done as an effective major leaguer. Machado is clearly the better free agent.
@trios4fun @lmeehan3 @JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim He has accomplished a whole lot more than “zip.”

@fotodave @erinscafe it’s so good. and it’s on netflix so you don’t even need pants
@erinscafe how DARE she
@erinscafe well the one movie you saw is the only one I did not
@fotodave @erinscafe worth seeing, in my top 20
@JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim Machado is more than two years younger than Manny was and has a higher career WAR in two fewer seasons.
@RbkBake yes!
@fotodave @erinscafe I thought Washington was a weak spot in BK. Driver was the star. I’d put Malek behind Cooper, Bale, Hawks, Phoenix, maybe James.
@fotodave @erinscafe you think? He’s not even top 4 for me for best actor
@erinscafe I didn’t like it. It’s just not a good movie. And it’s long.
@PadresOnABagel No, that is incorrect. You’re just being argumentative.
@JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim “that he’s one of the best ever FAs is overstated.”  No, it’s not.
@erinscafe they fired him partway through. that’s evident in the final product

@KirkWessler @bkverona good grief. Vizquel isn’t even close.
@PadresOnABagel The alternative was not drafting him. There was “no draft him/no football” option
@bchap07 @tlcote03 @skewlpsych Burning
@JakeElSnizake @sung_minkim Sung Min's right
@drivelinebases @mlb_agent opening the box worked fine for Pandora
@joshuablahblahh the money is immaterial. I don’t think he’s worth the 40-man spot and what that entails.
@PadresOnABagel The system is about to change.
@drivelinebases @PadresOnABagel Jameis Winston could have pulled this out of HS
@PadresOnABagel You don’t need this exact leverage. What about “pay me or I go be the starting QB at Alabama?”
@erinscafe I feel like the beard is actually hurting the suit
It’s pocket change to MLB. I think the 40-man spot and the Mount Everest-sized can of worms this would open are much bigger issues than what is actually a trivial amount of money to these billion-dollar businesses. https://t.co/e68ezrLtdT
@ajg6882 @JeffPassan Sunk cost. I understand your point though.
@ajg6882 @JeffPassan I wouldn't give him a 40-man spot myself
@TigerWu838 That's not the case here. And it hasn't happened in MLB in 15 years, I think.
@TigerWu838 correct, has been that way since 2012
@toasterposey @ryanfagan and every player drafted next year who has a football or hoops scholarship to a major D1 program...
@EthanHullihen It's prohibited - you can't give a drafted player a major league deal. They would have to convince MLB that isn't what's happening here and, IMO, that is what's happening here.
@EthanHullihen If he's on the 40-man he's not rule 5 eligible.

@TheGrandOldGame I thought I had a Pixies song and then I remembered Blackie starts by mumbling “this is a Jesus and Mary Chain song”
@TheGrandOldGame I apologize, I went to sleep. I was never a Dead fan either.
@JonathanFeld i'm not tryna tackle him
@JonathanFeld I don't think there's a human alive who could do it. But if there is, he ain't it.
@JonathanFeld Nobody can do that any more. Not least is that Murray is a long way away from MLB ready, and won't get there playing football 9 months out of the year.
@tishkabibble @wenbickert @ESPNDari I'd rather have it done in the open, with the same rules for everyone, not this ad hoc loophole basis.
@MkTeritoryPD 60-day DL opens a roster spot
@SriramofNorwell @AmirYaqubie @fladamd @ObermillerNate @mashmore98 @JeffPassan Right. Opens the door for a lot of teams and agents to try to evade the restrictions on drafted players.
@EyalShachar @LucyBoynton1 "Drive It Like You Stole It" was robbed.
@jaydestro @benyankee i don't have a good answer for that - it could be ugly
@Omicron013 he's going to go from a single full year in NCAA right to AA? That happens only with the absolute best college hitters and still they don't always pan out (Ackley)
@adamwells1985 @disguyyy yeah that was obvious crap
@bosummers7378 @TDMEL52 I don't do comparisons, just because I don't personally find them useful, but I think there is All-Star upside *if* he fully commits to baseball, year-round, and tries to make up for the lost time
@ldelong21 I don't know the first thing about football, sorry
@bosummers7378 @TDMEL52 Age matters. And that’s just not an accurate assessment of his potential, sorry.
@ClemenAlberto Well that’s not true.
@bosummers7378 @TDMEL52 Definitely not. Cutch was in the majors before he turned 23.
@EvanDrellich @jasongeisenheim he’d qualify for the fourth option year
@ivychat @RyanQDavis that comp came to mind too. similar problems. this was more entertaining
@colemarshall16 @jasongeisenheim doesn’t apply in this case
@VulgarBayFan others have already said the original report was inaccurate
@HotTamale1908 @jw_mike if he gets there AND is good
you can’t make a player ready when he’s not https://t.co/ZyJ8ueqGHo

@nyillini311 That’s 12 years ago
@VulgarBayFan No.
@sc101071 yes
@PaulH1987H I agree … and I agree.
@RyanQDavis well if you love the music and don’t mind being manipulated and get wrapped up in the Live Aid re-creation I get it. But it’s pablum.
oh, also, if the A's add Murray to the 40-man, he'd be out of options after 2022
@thjeca @RemainsOfChub @EmilyCWaldon @MinorLeagueBall he's being a pedantic ass so he can talk down to Emily
@wenbickert @ESPNDari big time
@AmirYaqubie @ObermillerNate @mashmore98 @JeffPassan I'm with Mike 100%
@LioneeR A major league contract = 40-man.
@jw_mike how marketable really? he'd go to low-A.
@TDMEL52 he already does
@DevanFink prior CBA, yes
@RemainsOfChub @EmilyCWaldon @MinorLeagueBall Mansplaining coward.
Scott Boras loved to demand major-league deals for his draft clients before the CBA prohibited them. Guess who represents Murray for baseball. https://t.co/W8AyrQ8BUe
@wenbickert @ESPNDari that will open a gigantic can of worms.
@Mar_and_Scout @LucyBoynton1 Sing Street was top ten for me that year, IIRC. Just loved so much about it, right up to not-quite-happy ending.
@_jschreiber i was tempted but knew the Live Aid scene was at the end and supposed to be good (it was)
@ESPNDari They can't just tear up his contract and give him a new one. They'd have to give him a major-league deal which is now prohibited for players right out of the draft.
@ESPNDari Or it's not accurate.
spends the rest of his life in hipster coffee shops https://t.co/tQimtxBsax
@ESPNDari They always knew he would likely declare for the NFL draft and this contract demand probably violates MLB rules (or would cost them multiple first round picks).
@ESPNDari This report does not pass the sniff test for me.
@njbuzz19 @BleacherReport @MikeLeslieWFAA um, he was always entering the NFL draft, and this story would mean he asked the A’s to violate MLB rules
@RDTopp @RabidMongoose @Baer_Bill No shot. They might as well strike that part of the CBA. Why not waive it for everyone?
@amandarykoff yeah i followed that drama too. Disappointing because i don’t think it helps the band’s legacy or his.
@amandarykoff the last point bothered me the whole movie
@johnfpettit @LucyBoynton1 keep pushing, it’s so good.
@thegr8juan_2 saw it, did not care for it at all.
@skewlpsych my #2 movie of 2018
@shelbymustang In fact it's a great year for critically acclaimed cinema, but those aren't the movies getting the hype right now.
@disguyyy I'd say wait. The music is great, though, and seeing the Live Aid recreation on the big screen is +.
@gooddays22 @ItsRamiMalek Malek was good and just generally fun. Plus I can't imagine how hard it was to lip sync with all of those Mercury recordings.
@RDTopp @Baer_Bill Kingery was two-plus years out of the draft and about to be added to the 40-man. The A's would have to add him to the 40-man now, which would itself be a dumb move, and would also likely incur MLB's wrath.
also it took me about 100 minutes to realize Mary was @LucyBoynton1, who is also in Sing Street, which everybody should go watch because it's fantastic

@starkers_tweets @JDC5000 I'm not anonymous, and you've added nothing here but the genetic fallacy (who cares if Josh is a journalist, his retort was still a strawman argument) and a misrepresentation of something totally unrelated that AOC did.
@Johnny0404 @RbkBake mid 90s? that wasn't even that well reviewed. I haven't seen it on any top 10s

@santoniobrown @Freddiesgato Lovely.
@SeriousMH I don't believe you, and there's plenty of mainstream coverage of him doing just that. I'm done here.
@SeriousMH That's not what I said, first of all. And if you haven't caught his race-baiting act, that's on you, not me.
@Books_Not_Wooks I'm with you on that. The lack of insight into Cheney was a major flaw.

@ajvollmer @ddiamond I think you're avoiding the question. If you make tobacco sales illegal, then you are proposing legal punishment for its sale and distribution. We've done this twice: Prohibition, a failure; and now about ninety years of marijuana prohibition, which has also been a failure.
@ajvollmer @ddiamond So you want to ban cigarettes and then jail people for nonviolent offenses for selling them? Pretty sure we've tried that before for something else, and it has done little good except for shareholders of private prison corporations.

@Baer_Bill @sarah_connors Her genuine ethos? I guess I don't see how we could know that with any degree of certainty. Plus the landscape has shifted on pot, on jailing nonviolent offenders, and on the school-to-prison pipeline, enough that I think a few Dem candidates will move left on this.
@sarah_connors @Baer_Bill that was my take too. If this is a policy shift from her, let’s applaud it.

@truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @t3tragrammat0n @doritmi @schadenfreudi @SharylAttkisson @chelss54 @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews "Vaccines are unavoidably unsafe." Still false. They are incredibly safe, safer than aspirin or acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and the most effective medical intervention man has ever discovered. Measles would be eradicated if we weren't fighting cranks who lie about vaccines.
@schadenfreudi Thanks, you too.
@chelss54 @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @SharylAttkisson @endodoc31 @komonews Denialists do love them vaccine inserts, but those aren't science, Cherry. They're written by lawyers, just like the inserts you don't read that come with all the medications you take.
@schadenfreudi And he still recommends vaccination, which Attkisson neglects to mention because it undermines her narrative.
@schadenfreudi Except it's not "legitimate information," because the evidence says he's wrong.
@truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @chelss54 @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @SharylAttkisson @endodoc31 @komonews You expect us to believe your child suffered a brain injury from vaccines, even though that’s impossible.

@chelss54 @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @SharylAttkisson @endodoc31 @komonews Except no one has provided any proof.
@schadenfreudi He’s one person whose opinion is contradicted by available evidence and by the global medical community.

@truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @chelss54 @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @SharylAttkisson @endodoc31 @komonews All false. And your child's "brain injury" probably had nothing to do with a vaccine, so all you're doing here is contributing to outbreaks of preventable, often fatal diseases like pertussis and measles.
@US395 I think she has misled people repeatedly about this story, and that this one doctor is pushing a discredited idea (but still argues for vaccination). There is simply no vaccine-autism link. The guy who first proposed it faked the data and then lost his medical license.
@truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @chelss54 @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @SharylAttkisson @endodoc31 @komonews Scapegoating a vaccine for a child's illness or genetic disorder doesn't change the facts. They don't destroy brains, or cause brain injuries - but they do save lives.
@US395 Happy to answer, but what's your specific question here? About vaccines and autism? This has been studied endlessly - there is zero link. Multiple large-sample studies found no association at all, and since autism is detectable in utero, there isn't a mechanism for it anyway.
@schadenfreudi He's not "the preeminent government vaccine Dr."
@US395 @SharylAttkisson @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @chelss54 @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @doritmi She said there is "a robust debate about the current one and its risk/benefit ration in USA."
