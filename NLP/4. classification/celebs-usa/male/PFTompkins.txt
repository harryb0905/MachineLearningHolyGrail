@markmcconville Finally Sweet Georgia Brown has a song!
@TheoMadla Maybe you shoulda just let the tweet stand, lesson learned?????????
@nwalks I guess we should get started on the screenplay of that idea, though.
@nwalks Ah shit, you‚Äôre right.
@nwalks If only we hadn‚Äôt already been on stage.

@zap_rowsdower16 If spirituality is important to Catholics they should have demanded this problem be addressed so so long ago. You can believe in the teachings of Christ and not support a corrupt institution. People have known about this &amp; buried their heads in the sand.
Okay, I really enjoyed that. If you don‚Äôt love Sam Elliott I honestly  don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
Why should the Catholic Church receive a single dime from its members when its leaders are just getting around to saying ‚ÄúHmmmmm what should we do about all the pedophiles we have always known about and helped keep safe for years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs start with that question Bish https://t.co/bfMQ7cWvgN

@parterre @einbert1986 Then James, you are welcome to do as I was invited to do &amp; did, and watch the whole fucking thing yourself! IT‚ÄôS A CONTEXT EXTRAVAGANZA https://t.co/C1J4Nksh6b
But I am glad that my tweet could offer a place in the replies to unite Feinstein defenders, MAGA heads, people who find it hilarious when  children are treated poorly, and at least one QAnon disciple.
And not for nothing, whoever told me, ‚ÄúUH, AT THE END SHE GIVES ONE OF THE GIRLS AN INTERNSHIP‚Äù edited out the notion that the girl ASKED for the internship, despite being talked to like an asshole.
There is still no justification for the rude, condescending and disrespectful way she spoke to that group, no matter how many minutes of passing around printouts there are.
K, watched the whole thing and it made no difference except no one told me she‚Äôs not even in the first two or last two minutes so my time was even more wasted. BUT! I‚Äôve done my due diligence!
@einbert1986 @parterre You get all of that James?

11:11 and so far the awful shit she said in the HEAVILY EDITED VIDEO has not been mitigated.
8:30 in and the parts that were cut out are standard politician stuff, less combative but she still talks to them like they‚Äôre idiots.
Okay, big ups to all involved in Mission Impossible: Fallout! Now to watch the UNEDITED DIANNE FEINSTEIN VIDEO, what a double featch!
@Manglewood Oh my GOD this moron

@BillCorbett Bill no I haven‚Äôt watched the unedited video
36 minutes in and it is worth adding to the chorus that the Mission Impossible franchise is the most underrated gigantically successful movie series.   cc: @doughboyspod
Okay a few people linking to a thread of the FULL UNEDITED VIDEO which is still somehow several parts? But fine. This whole thing was not my introduction to who Dianne Feinstein is, but I‚Äôll check out the FULL VIDEO after I‚Äôm done watching Mission Impossible: Fallout https://t.co/foEVzYhSpu
@johnlevenstein John, did you get to the part that completely negates the shitty stuff in the edited video?
@bigsteve8921 How about if instead of all the celebrities did that one and a half billionaires did it instead
@rachelmillman I have all kinds of tools &amp; medical supplies now.
@rachelmillman The knife slipped and closed on my index finger. I looked at the blade half-buried in my finger like a thing from a novelty shop. There was so much blood. A band-aid wasn‚Äôt gonna do it, and absent any other supplies, I wrapped it in paper towels &amp; scotch tape.
@rachelmillman When I was in my late 20s I was assembling an IKEA bookshelf using my only tool, a Swiss Army knife. At one point I had to take it apart &amp; start from scratch. I had to dig out one of those wooden pegs &amp; I used the blade of the knife.
@rachelmillman I honestly don‚Äôt know

@Randazzoj I think Dianne Feinstein was saying a silent prayer and it just LOOKED like she was talking to those kids like they adults who weren‚Äôt begging for their lives

@Quinoacowboi Did you not see where I replied to this point already or
@Quinoacowboi Because we MADE the math work out. We had all the time in the world but we still did it. We have far less time now for people to be saying ‚ÄúYour plan is unrealistic.‚Äù What was more unrealistic than traveling to OUTER SPACE just to do it? Make the plan real.
For real, if you‚Äôre gonna use conservatives‚Äô denial of/inaction on climate change as a political tool against them, it‚Äôs bad form to then tell little kids ‚ÄúShut up and save your strength for the Water Wars‚Äù
We went to SPACE with no clear idea of what we were going to get out of it. We made the money happen for it even though many thought it a waste of time. We got a LOT out of it &amp; we did it WITHOUT an immediate need to do so.  My point: we should shoot Dianne Feinstein into space. https://t.co/nuX2dZCoyL

@JShandsNorCal What made you think that at the end of that whole thread that I was using the word ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù in earnest
@JShandsNorCal It‚Äôs almost like that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
@ronsalas Why not
I‚Äôm sure the summit he‚Äôs got going on right now seems nice, but if The Pope does not follow the plan I have just laid out here I am skeptical that anything will change.
Then he repeats this in every country as needed.
He does this all across America. Not sure how he keeps a lid on it so the word doesn‚Äôt get out &amp; the priests &amp; staff can ‚Äúreassign‚Äù themselves away. Lookalikes? All descending simultaneously? Could be tricky &amp; run into money but the Pope could sell some art I guess.
He makes the priests write down the names of everyone who knew, everyone who covered it up. Pulls out the phone again &amp; waits til the cops show up &amp; put everyone in the rectory in cuffs. On to the next parish.
The Pope then flies to America. Starting on the East Coast, he goes from parish to parish, any place a priest molested kids, and shows up in the tracksuit &amp; sunglasses. ‚ÄúYou know who I am, right? Bad news: I just learned who YOU are.‚Äù
Clerk writes his name. Pope takes the list &amp; pulls a cell phone out of his pocket. ‚ÄúHey congrats,‚Äù The Pope says to the clerk, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to jail.‚Äù He calls the appropriate authorities and gives all the names. ‚ÄúThis is the Pope, by the way.‚Äù Hangs up.
When the clerk looks confused and opens his mouth, the Pope says, ‚ÄúYou know the names I mean.‚Äù The clerk hands over a list of all the priests who have been reassigned or ‚Äúretired‚Äù for molesting kids. Pope looks and says, ‚ÄúWrite your name at the bottom.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs what Pope Francis needs to do. It will take some time but it will be worth it.   Put on a white tracksuit and sunglasses. Go to whatever is the main records office for the Catholic Church is. Say ‚ÄúGive me the names.‚Äù
@sannewman That‚Äôs what I was doing when I was reading it, maybe that‚Äôs why it seemed so calm to me

@6point02x10to23 So while you have every right to your opinion and every right to express it, why not just quote-tweet me in your own feed with your arguments because as my initial tweet about enjoying the show might suggest: I do not care how you feel about it
@6point02x10to23 It‚Äôs okay not to like something, but not everyone is looking for a debate if they make a statement of positivity
@6point02x10to23 I think your pandering argument is pretty weak, I think they just wanted to use that song for that sequence, probably more to do with the lyrics than the time period
@6point02x10to23 I saw Days of Future Past and remember pretty much nothing about it except I didn‚Äôt like it. I like this a lot. Also I was born in 1968 but I like a lot of music from the 60s???????????????
@6point02x10to23 I saw all of Skyscraper, a bad movie, when I was invited on a bad movie podcast. That‚Äôs not the same thing as you telling me you didn‚Äôt like something in response to me saying I liked it.

@6point02x10to23 Hm you got me there, there can‚Äôt possibly be a similar time travel story before 1981  ANYWAY your two misgivings that you tried to make into three are sound sound sound reasons for 1) not watching a single second 2) telling someone who liked it why you won‚Äôt try it
@6point02x10to23 Maybe try watching the thing. Also, the graphic novel was written 7 years before the X-Men movie.
@6point02x10to23 Pandering to WHOM
@Jeff8275 (Jeff I‚Äôm a comedian)
@KesselChristina This almost made sense
@6point02x10to23 You made the same complaint into two separate tweets
@KesselChristina What you just said is profoundly stupid and nonsensical; it indicates an embarrassing immaturity and perhaps a lack of empathy. That‚Äôs just what I think and I am a VERY nice man.
The VERY first thing I saw was a cute story about him and a little kid and then the rest of the day was devoted to ‚ÄúHe was wet garbage holding a fan‚Äù
It‚Äôs kiiiiinda making me laugh that almost every single mention of Karl Lagerceld‚Äôs death is pretty much  some variation of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, Karl Lagerfeld was a complete asshole‚Äù

If you stop to think about, the percentage of people that I know whose lives were ruined by a medical issue are pretty much zero. So, I think the American people have spoken in the form of me, an American person.
Look, universal health care just isn‚Äôt pragmatic because I am all taken care of, don‚Äôt you see? It‚Äôs a nice idea, sure, but think of how I don‚Äôt need it, and then you‚Äôll see that we should instead focus on what‚Äôs not that.

@KrangTNelson Holy shit this is patriotism
@AManHasNoName7 Well then, the burden will be on New Era to now NOT make an inferior product. But I bet we both know what‚Äôs gonna happen! (Also, a little unfair to chide the coiners of the phrase ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù for not predicting that people were going to deny climate change as a reality.)
https://t.co/jrDl4aWae9
Look, I‚Äôm not going to ridicule this gross idiot for experiencing something that could happen to anyone. Rather, I would like to focus on the fact that who cares who is on Mt Rushmore, it is literally trivia https://t.co/0PQs5HiBoO
He‚Äôs right, Malia Obama should resign https://t.co/zdlK1VW3Ay
@AManHasNoName7 I guess we‚Äôll see, but I think it‚Äôs a case of what‚Äôs past is prologue with situations like these. Getting rid of union workers is highly unlikely to be the only corner cut.
@AManHasNoName7 I guess the serious answer is, if they‚Äôre willing to ‚Äúsave money‚Äù by eliminating union jobs, and those caps already have quality issues, do you think they‚Äôre doing this to IMPROVE the quality, when they are pretty much a monopoly?
This is now the worst thing New Era has done, narrowly pulling ahead of when they put their logo on just one side of the caps (instead of centered on the back, with the MLB logo) https://t.co/kcstxC6HJ1

@IfyNwadiwe You think people wouldn‚Äôt want to hear ME spit about Christ‚Äôs love? Get real, Iffs.
@paulandstorm I honestly don‚Äôt mind small talk, it‚Äôs just that one thing
But today I realized that from now on when anyone asks me ‚ÄúWhy are you going there/what brings you to town‚Äù I will simply respond ‚ÄúFUNERAL‚Äù
I don‚Äôt like telling the tuth because saying ‚Äúactor‚Äù invites ‚Äúwhat have I seen you in‚Äù (nothing they‚Äôve seen) and ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù is worse because it just makes the driver feel embarrassed for me; since  they haven‚Äôt heard of me, I must be struggling.
I could not come up with any lies fast enough so I just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not talk about it.‚Äù They guy apologized &amp; now I feel a little bad. But I dread someone asking me ‚ÄúWhy are you traveling to [fill in city]?‚Äù
Just tried to deflect the ‚ÄúSo what do you do‚Äù Lyft driver question with ‚ÄúWriter‚Äù because there are usually no followup questions but today THERE WERE FOLLOWUPS.

@bader_diedrich @MJMcKean I mean, I don‚Äôt enjoy the songs, by and large, but they are nominated and I assume some people enjoy them. I sort of endorse them as a little break in the show. At least there‚Äôs only 5 &amp; we haven‚Äôt seen them performed over &amp; over.

@nshady I just tweeted about it NICK
I one thousand per cent endorse this show and am thrilled it is available here now. GET IT https://t.co/9ZbMhsAFNB
@TheJustinGiglio That‚Äôs not a thing that happens every year, but sure, or that
@bigbearII See how it took you two tweets to convey the idea whereas I used the word ‚Äútech‚Äù and you knew exactly what I meant?
I would much rather see an Oscar given out for Best Stunts than see that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have what she‚Äôs having‚Äù clip jammed into some montage full of other scenes we‚Äôve all seen a trillion times
The ONLY montage needed/wanted: The Death Parade (you may know it as ‚ÄúIn Memorium‚Äù)
They could shorten the ceremony/broadcast (and even add some more tech categories) if they would eliminate the countless montages about the movies. If anyone‚Äôs watching already, YOU DON‚ÄôT NEED TO SELL THEM ON THE CONCEPT OF MOVIES. https://t.co/YwUGmhxIyX

@WilmaFingerdue Please show me one previous-to-Bean example of someone getting a massive prop turkey stuck on their head. This is a VERY SPECIFIC THING.
@thatbilloakley That‚Äôs not a turkey. I‚Äôm not saying Mr Bean invented getting stuff stuck on your head. I‚Äôm saying you can‚Äôt just put a giant turkey carcass on your head and act like you haven‚Äôt seen the one other time it was done.

@johnlevenstein John, I hope this is the inaugural tweet in a new personal genre, where you plug someone‚Äôs project and rate how easy/difficult it is to be happy for that person.
@scurvyelbow How are you enjoying your second hour on twitter
What we should be talking about is that we now have an opportunity to produce no further Batman movies. How will history judge us in this moment?

@mrgregshields I didn‚Äôt come around, my instinct was correct that it was not a good show
@EverCarradine Hahaha
@tonnslingdog @decider @stephenfalk Todd you are making me blush

It has honestly been fun seeing how certain so many people are about which show it is. Like, EXTREMELY confident. To the point where some people are EXPOUNDING on the show they are certain that it is. Peak TV, guys!

@Lennyjacobson Oh and I am not going to confirm or deny the guesses
@chrissyteigen @ElizabethEThorp No can do Chris
@Lennyjacobson 1) yes 2)no 3) none
@BDBurrow It‚Äôs actually great
@ke3024 Why this is twitter
@ElizabethEThorp Can‚Äôt do it Liz
@SamBearIt Good of you to stick up for this show even though you have no idea what it is
I am watching the second episode of a show I hated after the first episode because so many people told me how great it is &amp; so I thought I‚Äôd give it another chance &amp; it turns out my instincts are GREAT
@MsKetherDonohue @MandellMaughan @SPONTANEANATION @DammitCARL @shaundiston @Jackie_Michele I guess it‚Äôs safe to reveal now that this was the sole purpose of starting the podcast in the first place

@AUChizad It‚Äôs all ‚ÄúTrump derangement syndrome‚Äù and these people are nice and just like red hats and Trump is also nice, no one is mean except people who spread fake news about red hats
@AUChizad The people at his conventions in shirts that said ‚ÄúFuck your feelings,‚Äù they just thought it was a cool shirt, right? There‚Äôs no correlation between people‚Äôs allegiance to this bully and liking the bully aspect, right?
@AUChizad Sure. It‚Äôs narcissism. So what percentage of people who wear those hats are doing it for the reasons I said? If not 100, what would you wager? Zero?
@AUChizad Did you see this particular scarecrow
@AUChizad It‚Äôs not politics. People don‚Äôt wear those hats because they like Trump‚Äôs views on trade. It‚Äôs something else. And you know it.
@AUChizad Theres a world of difference between someone wearing an Obama shirt in Mississippi and those hats. And you know it! It‚Äôs a statement. And you know it. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúmerch.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe current president,‚Äù it‚Äôs Donald Trump. It‚Äôs specifically about him.
@AUChizad There was at least one guy that said it https://t.co/YxERwAVlTz
@AUChizad @SmrtHandsome Well now, I have stuff to do too, man. Don‚Äôt accuse me of putting on a pot of coffee and getting out the white board to craft a reply to you. I‚Äôm not the one who said you were dragging your feet.
I have deleted my tweet that contained the link but I stand by my terrific mockery of TMZ, I am very proud, I am a boy who is proud! https://t.co/21IP3jmdie
Okay, so TMZ is the ONLY source saying the ‚ÄúMAGA country‚Äù thing. In my haste to make fun of their ‚ÄúMAGA supporters‚Äù phrasing, I forgot they were still TMZ. https://t.co/2HM5BuSjE2
@AUChizad Those hats are meant to be a provocation. People who wear them like getting a rise out of other people. Be honest.
@AUChizad No, I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve seen every length of the videos and I don‚Äôt think that Covington kid was ‚Äúsilently praying.‚Äù People wear those hats as a declaration of a bully mentality. You know that they do. So I‚Äôm not agreeing with you, I‚Äôm saying you are pretending.
@jmebressler Nope!
@BillCorbett CHEAP HAT BE MY DAD
@AUChizad Maybe it‚Äôs because those hats are deliberately worn as a provocation, but pretending that is not their sole appeal and purpose is what you apparently do.
@AUChizad Wait what was my previous incident of spreading fake news about the MAGA hats

@nsilverberg It‚Äôs the least weird thing I‚Äôve ever heard.
Hardly any likes for these tweets OH NOES I AM BEING SHADOWBANNED
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a billionaire businessman, why‚Äôd you all of a sudden decide to get into politics at the highest level?‚Äù  ‚ÄúUh, cuz I deeply care about &amp; relate to non-billionaires &amp; but was too busy making money earlier to run for city council or whatever so I‚Äôm making up for lost time.‚Äù
Someone who hasn‚Äôt heard the word ‚Äúno‚Äù for decades unless it‚Äôs coming out of his own mouth is definitely a guy you want in charge of a system of government
It only make sense that someone who has spent their entire life in pursuit of wealth and then suddenly decides they want to run an entire country has YOUR interests front &amp; center in their mind

The people that say everything they don‚Äôt like to hear is fake have to make up stuff to be mad at, and then make a lot of noise about outrage culture and people seeing racism everywhere etc
This piece of shit MAGA bully page doctored a screencap of something my wife tweeted and made it say something that no one would ever actually say. That‚Äôs what these feeble-brained cowards have to do to feel ‚Äúright.‚Äù https://t.co/DzdrrfaErN

@JoseMOrdonez1 That‚Äôs all of them &amp; it‚Äôs not new
I am spewing all of this uncontrollably because the thing that stuck with me all these years after Catholic school is Christ‚Äôs message of love. So that video of that kid and the school‚Äôs hiding from the fallout sickens me to my core. I‚Äôm sorry this isn‚Äôt funny!
Not only should these kids not have been out there publicly mocking anyone, they shouldn‚Äôt have had those fucking hats on in the first place. I‚Äôm sure if you banned them, the parents would be upset, right? Why not model your courage after that of Christ?
If Christ returned today, do you really think he‚Äôd have a lot of positive reviews for Donald Trump?  Is it truly all about whoever says they‚Äôre against abortion? Are you a single-issue religion?
I went to catholic school for 12 years &amp; you know what was a very big deal? Aside from the teachings of Christ that is? DRESS CODES. We had to look a certain way at all times. Even a class trip! We could wear casual clothes but there were certain things explicitly out of bounds.
These pathetic cowards. If you‚Äôre gonna hide from people because you can‚Äôt accept the completely earned anger your students inspired at least take out the publicly viewable parts about how you‚Äôre educating young men ‚Äúspiritually and socially.‚Äù https://t.co/5bqojfMz64

I didn‚Äôt know what to say.
I placed my carryon atop the belt. ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù the Agent said urgently, ‚ÄúIs it true? That Chuck Schumer threw a shutdown party and had a TSA agent pi√±ata fashioned? And the pi√±ata was filled with our paychecks? And he &amp; all the democrats ate the checks when they fell out?‚Äù
As I approached the conveyor belt, an agent grabbed one of those dog-dish containers used for small items. He vomited discretely, then looked at me, abashed. ‚ÄúApologies, sir,‚Äù he murmured, wiping his mouth, ‚ÄúI suddenly pictured the Democrats. All of them.‚Äù
At the airport. As I approached security I saw several TSA Agents kneeling in prayer. As one, their they offered up their supplications in reverent whispers. I‚Äôm a pretty good lip reader so I could discern that they were all praying for President Trump.

@TheBigOnesPod @janiehaddad I would tell the niece ‚ÄúIf you are still together in 5 years I will perform your wedding ceremony.‚Äù
@JoshMalina Josh, I am one of the people who saw that show the one time it aired. Can you help me connect with other people who share this unique trauma?

@MilesKlee Truly!

@brianlraney You never told me how it felt
@SalAntithesis Anyway let me know when you‚Äôre ready to apologize
@SalAntithesis There is no point in arguing because I‚Äôm the initial tweet I clearly stipulate the theory is airtight, makes sense, and that we all agree, not really sure what you‚Äôre doing here

@GaryJMatthews It‚Äôs not, I just said it wasn‚Äôt, maybe take another run at reading the tweets and perhaps you‚Äôll see
@BusyPhilipps The people who made it should be in jail.
@SalAntithesis Wrong, what I said was the right thing, go reread it and apologize
@professorhazard Thank you for agreeing with me
@el_travos Do they
@edfischman @DADDOISTIRED That‚Äôs the mockery part
@bradiscranky And yet it was, isn‚Äôt that weird how it supports and validates my point

One of the horrible accidents is a positive home pregnancy test; gotta admit, that‚Äôs pretty funny.
There is a commercial that depicts a series of HORRIBLE ACCIDENTS in 1st person POV and I am trying to describe it to a friend and he asked me what it‚Äôs a commercial for and I have no idea. The concept of pain?
@StopMakingPence No because the stories were true and only the names were changed to protect the innocent, I wish people could reread the tweet I posted because it includes all@the information you need including that everyone agree with me
@CMWAshby Thank you Charlie Laser Sword
@GIMilner There is also a theme song
@BotDabs Oof. You should delete this reply with the link before anyone sees it and your friends &amp; family have to stage an embarrassment intervention
@MrSmythe5 Go lie down
@MrSmythe5 You‚Äôve had now two tries to write ‚Äúcaptain‚Äôs log‚Äù correctly so maybe you should figure out whose head your ass is in first   Matthew 7:5
@BotDabs Is part of the protocol ‚Äútell us what your overall mission is even we already know you are ordered to say some poetic stuff about space‚Äù I‚Äôm so, SO sorry that you have been made so wrong
@jjsgriller @wannabeatheist That‚Äôs not a mockumentary because Rod Serling is the host of the show and directly addresses the camera and introduces the stories, my tweet is infallible and you should read it again
@GIMilner It‚Äôs not vexing at all, he‚Äôs saying it to audience, you should really reread my initial tweet
Sad so many people are using this argument when the captain‚Äôs log in each episode is different, why would he say the same thing  before every entry it‚Äôs clearly for an audience, sorry to make you all wrong https://t.co/x870VPhhm1
@GIMilner Then why doesn‚Äôt he say ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äôs Log Preface: SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER‚Äù
@nathanpthousand The show is over by that point, ineligible also laugh track
@megnbarnes Which captains, how many do this
@ColleenSmi He doesn‚Äôt say it at the beginning but good bullying
@MrSmythe5 All of them?
@seanphughes99 It‚Äôs a terrible WHAT
@cubfansince76 Captain‚Äôs Log being read aloud supports my theory which everyone already agrees with, thank you
@wannabeatheist Talking heads came later, this is the very first TV mockumentary and we all agree, you should reread my tweet
Captain Kirk‚Äôs opening narration explaining that you are watching the voyages of the starship Enterprise means he knows there‚Äôs an audience &amp; thus makes Star Trek the first TV mockumentary. We all agree this makes sense and is airtight and true.

What kind of Olympic-level liar do you have to be to try and claim that teachers are ‚Äúgreedy.‚Äù Like, you have to put in way more than 10,000 lying hours. You have to walk into crowded rooms &amp; yell ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT IN THIS ROOM‚Äù and believe that people will believe it. https://t.co/ljpmcHBFza

@johnlevenstein I mean, it‚Äôs such a specific word, I think it‚Äôll be a good while. If it starts to mean something else I won‚Äôt like that.
It‚Äôs very rare that I make pronouncements like this, so I try to do it only when necessary. Here goes:  I used to find the word ‚Äúhorny‚Äù gross and embarrassing but now I find it amusing and honestly kind of cute.
@EADizzle I think this response is all the evidence needed to exclude you from judging what is and isn‚Äôt funny.
@Qimmortal @EbanSchletter Listen to Monday‚Äôs episode for your special shoutout. Your generosity is greatly appreciated! Thanks for being a good guy.
@Qimmortal @EbanSchletter No no no, than Q!

@EADizzle @axhart I mean if you‚Äôre gonna try to roast someone with ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand big words‚Äù you should at least know the common term for big words
@EADizzle Hahaha ‚Äúframed it poorly‚Äù he was ‚Äúfactually correct‚Äù about A NUMBER. And of course it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù to use naughty language in politics but that horse has left the barn, friend!   The REAL issue facing us now is: you got mad at a joke
@EADizzle So when he explained who the 47% were he WASN‚ÄôT really making a valid point? And also didn‚Äôt have a valid point about Tlaib? This is confusing! Why are you even arguing with me if we both seem to feel that Romney is full of shit?
@JohnRossBowie Bing-the fuck-GO

@BrandonR4KY So my spelling is actually okay.
@frangeladuo Love, love, loved hearing you two talk comedy and share your experiences.
Oh man it was a TREAT to hear my old fellow VH1 construction paper pals Frangela talking about Second City and all sorts of stuff on YOTR. A terrific hour! https://t.co/YSSUzHSWI4
@BrandonR4KY Did you respond twice to the same tweet in two minutes with two different goodbyes? Off topic: I am VERY interested in examples of my horrendous spelling.
@BrandonR4KY The joke was that you would TURN INTO a Trump voter based on all the PC talk, not that you already were one. You seem to have problems with nuance, as evinced by your arguments!   And I won‚Äôt stop at ‚Äúdo better.‚Äù My advice to you is... #BeBest
@BrandonR4KY Yeah, I‚Äôm familiar with George Carlin. You could also learn from a much funnier comic. Get it? Enjoy voting for Trump in 2020 to own your fellow libs!
@BrandonR4KY I honestly don‚Äôt care.
@BrandonR4KY I wish I could say it‚Äôs been enjoyable to have this debate with you but it really hasn‚Äôt!
@BrandonR4KY You have been trying and trying and trying to make the case that this language policing is a widespread scourge ruining society but you have not been able to prove it. There‚Äôs no threat. Maybe it makes you feel okay to say it because you‚Äôve been saying it since 2009.   BE FREE.
@BrandonR4KY Why would I assume moderate-right would be part of ‚Äúmoderate?‚Äù Republicans voted for Trump because he ran as a Republican. Anyone turned off enough by PC language to vote for Trump‚Äî that‚Äôs an idiotic reason to vote for a President. To feel good about ‚ÄúMerry Christmas?‚Äù
@BrandonR4KY You can make a statement, add in details you omitted when called out and reiterate the first statement, but that doesn‚Äôt make it patently true.
@BrandonR4KY Oh, they‚Äôre moderate-RIGHT now. Come on man. The thing he‚Äôs been the most honest about is bigotry. This argument is not sound. You wanna say words that people have asked you not to say? Go right ahead. Literally no one is stopping you. No one is stopping Louis.
@BrandonR4KY Anyone who uses that line of reasoning to vote for an obvious liar‚Äî I‚Äôd rather not cater to THEM.
@BrandonR4KY Sorry‚Äî do YOU think Trump was ‚Äúrefreshingly honest?‚Äù People liking his hateful speech and calling it ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù are not ‚Äúmoderate.‚Äù
@BrandonR4KY No one got turned to Trump because they got fed up with not saying ‚Äúmidget.‚Äù
@BrandonR4KY There is nothing lazier than saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to change what I call you because it hurts your feelings.‚Äù Using the Howard Stern example is a perfect illustration of your misguided thought process. Empathy is not the enemy.
@BrandonR4KY So is your argument ‚ÄúConservative bigots hate PC language, liberals should too?‚Äù
@BrandonR4KY Yes, I am disagreeing with your larger point
@BrandonR4KY I don‚Äôt know what personal experience made you feel like you have to pretend the world is falling apart but maybe consider that you were wrong that time.
@BrandonR4KY 1) Tracy‚Äôs joke (2011) was about stabbing his son if he said he was gay right? And this was before he was cast as the lead in his new tv show, yes? It‚Äôs a good show BTW 2) OH NO, HOWARD STERN GAVE A SHIT ABOUT SOMEONE‚ÄôS FEELINGS THE THOUGHT POLICE GOT HIM
@BrandonR4KY ‚ÄúSafe spaces‚Äù and ‚Äútrigger warnings‚Äù have probably helped more people than they have harmed, despite becoming a dumb, easy punchline for people who think they‚Äôre funny (but aren‚Äôt).
@BrandonR4KY That was almost 10 years ago now. So this is a very slow cancer? You keep talking about this stuff like it‚Äôs an urgent dilemma.
@BrandonR4KY You're looking at this in a very simplistic, reactionary way. There's a much larger picture here.
@BrandonR4KY But this whole ‚Äúpolicing of language‚Äù has still not turned out to be the Orwellian nightmare we‚Äôre feverishly being told is happening again and again and again.
@BrandonR4KY Whether or not that is true is a different debate, and there is a case to be made that he has often punched down in his comedy &amp; that it just seems worse now, in light of revelations about him.
@BrandonR4KY The vast majority of criticisms about the subject matter of Louis‚Äô recent set are not ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT.‚Äù People are saying the material is weak and mean and there‚Äôs a shift in his targets.
@BrandonR4KY Come on. Have you? Are you touring college campuses? Or have you heard the same handful of stories I‚Äôve heard? Every time people talk about this stuff they, like you, frame it as ‚Äúa cancer.‚Äù It‚Äôs not.
@BrandonR4KY Give me an example of this liberal authoritarianism with language.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Hahaha ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù I addressed every single example. Twitter outcry ALSO didn‚Äôt get Gilbert fired, excuse me!
@pavlovhoney1 @thewillbryant @BrandonR4KY This is weak.
@GodAlmighti You don‚Äôt or won‚Äôt understand a few concepts here.
@isaacwitty Hi Isaac! Long time no see. Just to be clear: I was not starting a debate, I was declaring those people were idiots. ANYWAY goodbye for another decade or whatever!
@GodAlmighti Did he mention how he was a sex offender? Like at all?
@GodAlmighti What did he say about himself? Because I remember reading about his first set back and he did material on parades. Then a couple sets later he talked about how he‚Äôd been through Hell and lost millions of dollars. THAT kind of making fun of himself?
@ChudFusk I never said everyone liked his material or that everyone thought he was previously enlightened or that everyone used to think he was funny
@lysergicserpent Hm tell me more about the comedy process, it seems FASCINATING
@thewillbryant @BrandonR4KY Hahaha if you saw ‚ÄúI Love You Daddy‚Äù you‚Äôd know that ain‚Äôt happening.
@Walrus_Legend Here‚Äôs one thought: you are not qualified to discuss comedy with me, Doug Stanhope or Louis CK for that matter. That‚Äôs all ya get!
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever An obvious joke https://t.co/WZkkHgD94z
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Gilbert told some edgy jokes on twitter while he was working for an insurance company and his job was saying one word. The insurance company didn‚Äôt like the jokes and they are an insurance company. The government did not fire Gilbert.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever That is not happening to Louis, an admitted sex offender who is still being allowed on stages any time he wants.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever It was a campaign motivated by hypocrisy. James talked shit about Trump and MAGAheads combed through his tweets. Perhaps misguidedly, James refused to delete old, stupid joke tweets, and his bosses caved in a cowardly fashion.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever You could have just said James Gunn, as he is the only recent example. And it‚Äôs a good one! That is a PERFECT example of people politically motivated to get someone fired, and unfortunately it worked.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever It doesn‚Äôt, but also, none of the people you listed (even the living ones) were ever going to host the Oscars‚Äî or the Kids Choice Awards, for that matter. Not every job is appropriate for ‚Äúoff-color‚Äù comedians. That‚Äôs not censorship.
@kendallybrown I was merely trying to provide some BARE MINIMUM stuff he could have done. I still believe in redemption, though! But yeah, you have to give a shit.
@mjfern6 I was answering a question, that‚Äôs what the lil picture with the words was, it was a response not an ‚Äúassertion‚Äù and I also said ‚Äúcould‚Äù not ‚Äúshould‚Äù
@trickyc66 Great
@Walrus_Legend Your point is you‚Äôd rather listen to Doug saying ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt judge this material because it‚Äôs not finished yet‚Äù than me saying ‚ÄúI can absolutely judge this material because i am also a professional comedian who is familiar with how material is constructed‚Äù  Right?
@AndyRichter @Walrus_Legend Haha
@wolfbpj Your gues is as good as mine, Wolf Blitzer Psycho Jazz
@Walrus_Legend @AndyRichter I started doing standup in 1986 do I win your mind Mr. Math
@rachelmillman We‚Äôll see!
@LadyKateBond Absolutely wrong.
@LadyKateBond It‚Äôs good!!
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Luckily no one has been lynched, beaten to death or dragged from the back of a truck for being fat.   There‚Äôs no need to discuss the ‚Äútran‚Äù things, right? We‚Äôll pretend that didn‚Äôt happen.  Hey. You NEED to grow up.
@OutForRepairs Weird, no issue with any of the other things I suggested in response to the question ‚ÄúWhat would you have Louis do?‚Äù Just the word ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù didn‚Äôt work for you?
@sandman012 How did it go getting this vlog to happen https://t.co/WdE9uPVB9S
@kennyjaworski @Shockrates I recall he mistakenly apologized to one person for an assault he committed  on another person.
@1984flyawayhome @bobbyfucknhit Bobby, I‚Äôm sorry this guy called you a dough bag. It‚Äôs weird, it feels like you should be on the same side here.

@LadyKateBond I am most gratified.
@MagicMikeXXL__ @JimNorton Like, no link even?

@MrEmilyHeller Yeah man YEAH
@LadyKateBond Here‚Äôs you in the waiting room https://t.co/f8Tf6cqYyB
@MeekinOnMovies Good bit, thanks
@LadyKateBond This dude? https://t.co/GVainbMPJy
@LadyKateBond This is incredible.
@MeekinOnMovies Only if it‚Äôs a movie
@HerbMarselas Herb you‚Äôre killing it move the word ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù to the front of your bio
@claudwal @MarcEvanJackson @FillmoreDetroit @DCP_improv Thank you Clauds!
@Manglewood Hahahaha
@benpobjie No, I know
@MeekinOnMovies Stick to movies
@UncleFlansy Another expert heard from, thank you for getting it
@HerbMarselas Herb, as a fellow comedian, walk me through the scenario where the cops are questioning you about Twitter
‚ÄúLastly‚Äî and this is important‚Äî if you want to talk about politics? STICK TO COMEDY. If you want to talk about comedy? SHUT UP. Never forget that the comedian is the one who knows the least about comedy and is forbidden to talk about other stuff.‚Äù
@lindaholmes I‚Äôm onto a different thing now Linda
‚ÄúRemember! Humor is subjective, so audiences should defend comedians they like at all costs no matter what they do and they should tear down the ones they don‚Äôt like if at all possible. That‚Äôs called SUBJECTIVITY.‚Äù
‚ÄúEvery comedian must be able to DESTROY a heckler. If the comedian cannot or will not DESTROY the heckler, they are NOT a VALID COMEDIAN. Even non-comedians somehow know this, though it‚Äôs been kept secret for years. It‚Äôs 99% of the job.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre on the subject of comedy, you gotta factor in that heckling is not only just part of comedy, it is an EQUAL part of comedy, equivalent to and as important as the standup itself. It MUST happen.‚Äù
‚ÄúLook, here‚Äôs how comedy works: the actual premise is THE LAST thing that comes into place.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on this bit where I sound like an ignorant bully BUT after I have finished the bit it will not sound like that at all, I bet. You gotta trust the process.‚Äù
Lot of experts on ‚Äútrying out material‚Äù have found voice of late
@mjfern6 With respect, he owes me personally nothing &amp; I never said otherwise (as a human being he may just owe other people a CONSIDERABLE amount), and that set was a pile of shit
@kendallybrown That is a WHOLE OTHER conversation about remorse &amp; redemption that I wish we were having but he is definitely NOT that guy.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Also, it‚Äôs very telling that you say people ‚Äúare tired of being told what to say‚Äù when 1) what they‚Äôre being .*asked* to say is something that a person they‚Äôre addressing has asked them to say 2) Most people are upset that they‚Äôre being told NOT to say things (like, slurs)
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever What‚Äôs the most recent example of someone being fired for making a joke on social media?   Reminder: Kevin Hart stepped down from a one-night ‚Äújob‚Äù and his career is fine
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Your words not mine
@niravrph Hahaha you sound a thousand years old, go take a nap, Granny!
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever You were so close to having a point and then it all fell apart. But! You got closer to a point than Louis‚Äô latest set!
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Wait I‚Äôm in a bubble and MOST POEPLE, THE AVERAGE JOES, are worried about a social media lynch mob coming for them?
@VincentVangokh You will shocked to learn that people said all the same things about every single person you‚Äôve listed. The only real difference is Lenny Bruce actually WAS hassled by the law, not a social media platform. Go unclutch your pearls &amp; stop being a sex pest apologist.
@cubfansince76 I care about this stuff and maybe an explanation of my point could resonate with someone.
@BrandonR4KY How about all the other sets he‚Äôs done, read up on those, they feature him complaining about losing millions of dollars &amp; going through ‚ÄúHell‚Äù
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever It‚Äôs so so so so easy to slippery slope this and much harder to just accept that what is happening is what is happening: Louis is making a gross, ugly comeback and is a gross, ugly person.
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever I forgot Louis was our only standup comedian, it‚Äôs good he‚Äôs back doing unapologetic comedy about how marginalized people and children should shut up
@niravrph HAHAHA ‚Äúedgy‚Äù not ‚Äúashy‚Äù  I AM SAYING RIGHT NOW THAT COMEDY MAY NO LONGER BE ASHY
@justinstromber2 I‚Äôm very sorry you can‚Äôt see how all this is connected but I understand it‚Äôs difficult for some people
@justinstromber2 @_andrewmartin_ @tqbf ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúsecret‚Äù in this context, it means ‚Äúindividual and direct,‚Äù maybe go rest your big brain
@justinstromber2 @JCEdmund @daveweigel Yes definitely in this discussion of Louis CK I am the true villain
@justinstromber2 @paulbasss I was responding to a hypothetical situation, that might make it even more fun for you, a very smart person who is good at arguing
@DougStanhope @IceIceDante I must have read it backwards. Happy New Year, Doug!
@gensabine @less_scrutable @danagould What‚Äôs a sample freakout that I may judge for myself, could I see a screencap or something?
@niravrph What would you say the ‚Äúdifferent thinking‚Äù he was trying to provoke was with those riffs
@niravrph 1) No one has said comedy can‚Äôt be ashy anymore 2) that riff was extremely hacky and pointless  3) he‚Äôs had all this time to think of material and this is what he comes up with?
@niravrph Thank you I personally am dealing with it by saying it sucks and Louis is a coward
@gensabine @less_scrutable @danagould I haven‚Äôt seen anyone FREAK THE FUCK OUT, but I have seen people saying Louis‚Äô new material sucks. Is that the same thing?
@IceIceDante @DougStanhope I am aware of Doug‚Äôs take which quickly shifted to the legalities of bootlegging
@paulbasss I have zero doubt that if social media were a thing while Pryor was in his heyday and all of those things were common knowledge AND RECOGNIZED AS UNACCEPTABLE AS THEY JUST ABOUT BARELY ARE TODAY, he‚Äôd have done material on all of it
@paulbasss It‚Äôs true Richard Pryor didn‚Äôt admit to those things, say he was going to take a long break to listen, and then come back and not talk about them. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúthe social media age,‚Äù it‚Äôs about individual actions
@bobbycolada73 I‚Äôm making s‚Äômores over this take
@BrandonR4KY @Worst_Hero_Ever Hey George Orwell no one is restricting anything, they are criticizing something
@BrandonR4KY Why would be not be working on THAT material now, after nine months off?
@CountSaltula SPOILER: He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs already said on stage that HE has been through hell. He is not building towards anything except playing to people who want him back and feel he did nothing ‚Äúreally‚Äù wrong. You can stop giving him the benefit of the doubt.
@JCEdmund @daveweigel The market place is deciding his fate   Criticism is not censorship   This is not toooooo hard to understand
@VincentVangokh No one is setting any rules but some people are offering informed professional critiques of a famous comedian, it seems we were not on the same page after all
@_andrewmartin_ @tqbf Any word on those personal apologies chief
@PhillyinRVA The only people bringing him ‚Äúowing‚Äù anything are the people who greet any critique of him with ‚ÄúWHAT DOES HE OWE US‚Äù
@AngerHeSmiles It‚Äôs not like that at all because of one crucial difference, I wonder if you can figure out what it is
@AngerHeSmiles Doesn‚Äôt it seem odd that we have not heard a single word that he‚Äôs done ANYTHING in that way? And he sure as shit hasn‚Äôt apologized to those women individually or at least ONE of them would have said something. Don‚Äôt you think?
@IfyNwadiwe ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AngerHeSmiles He never apologized. You insinuated I was being unfair, just as Louis insinuated he apologized (but didn‚Äôt, actually)
@JimmyJump90 Also lol at ‚Äúinsane standard‚Äù maybe try growing the fuck up
@JimmyJump90 You‚Äôre right, assaulting people and subsequently having your reps intimidate those people into silence and lying about it for years does sound like a real dumbbell move and far from monstrous.
@BillCorbett Hahahahaha
@AngerHeSmiles No it‚Äôs too late you got me worked up, I‚Äôm insane now and I am being very unfair to Louis who we‚Äôll never know from his current behavior whether or not he‚Äôs done any of the things I said, it is impossible to judge &amp; I‚Äôm probably just nuts from your comment
@trickyc66 As opposed to whom
@AngerHeSmiles Hahaha yeah, seize on this specifically unprovable thing even though you know full well he probably didn‚Äôt! WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT‚ÄôS IN HIS HEART, RIGHT!
And with that, it‚Äôs BACK IN THE GENERIC POOL FOR ME! https://t.co/40Y3bDKMYw
And remember‚Äî it would have been LEGENDARILY HILARIOUS, because unlike me or you, Louis is FEARLESS and CAN MAKE ANYTHING FUNNY, even something introspective and truly self-deprecating!
- Could have taken some of the money from the millions he absolutely still has to set up a foundation (for someone else to run) to aid victims of abuse  - or at least made a sizable donation to RAINN - and then could have put together an hour special about what he has learned
Louis, the genius comic who could make ANYTHING funny (right?) who admitted he did awful things &amp; vowed to take a long time to listen, could have: - sought specialized therapy for his specific issue  - actually apologized (not just admitted he did things) to the people he harmed
This is a great question, one that  gets asked a lot, and seems to be a real BAFFLER to people who know nothing about stand-up comedy/ empathy. I‚Äôm happy to answer in the tweet after this one! https://t.co/11ZcRmUpll
@gensabine No, it‚Äôs missing the point. That‚Äôs why I said that.
Yes. Every idiot saying ‚ÄúUh, this is what Louie‚Äôs material has always been like, he‚Äôs not doing anything different now‚Äù is missing the point. https://t.co/hGDHZq9j7c

If the dad WOULD vote for Biden? I could let that sink in! It won‚Äôt make me want Joe Biden to run for President, but it makes sinking the information in more attractive. If the dad merely COULD vote for Biden? Your sink-in privileges have been REVOKED! Let THAT steam over!
This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúuseful information‚Äù until the dad gets off the COULD/WOULD fence! I absolutely REFUSE to let it sink in until this is settled! Consider this ‚Äúinformation‚Äù stored in a ramekin until such time as it is ready to be applied for in-sinkage! https://t.co/oKtRmHxAc7

@DiegoEspinoza60 Diego, maybe you should be done for the day, big holiday coming up
@DiegoEspinoza60 You may be surprised to learn that the part about kids testifying before Congress was a reference to the Parkland kids. Too bad, it was almost a HILARIOUS bit!
@Fetzer2 @cinemaven He was just in a major motion picture that made a ton of money &amp; was nominated for several awards
@SoSaySoothsayer @davidaxelrod It doesn‚Äôt, but then again that‚Äôs not what I was trying to do. And if you‚Äôre trying to say me mildly insulting this political figure is the same as anything Louis has done or said, maybe YOU‚ÄôRE not helping either.
@ralfeecakes Please I beg of you to look up the word censorship
@efd @heliumcell Sound vaguely familiar
@JayRoy08 Can movie reviews not say that a movie is bad?
@JayRoy08 It‚Äôs okay to say ‚ÄúI wish this guy would go away because I think he‚Äôs a bad guy‚Äù  It‚Äôs not okay for the government to say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not allowed to say these types of things‚Äù   Do u c the diff
@JayRoy08 But anyway, yes you had nothing but good intentions, clearly https://t.co/hA0xOOO4xA
@JayRoy08 You never said what we don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee eye to eye‚Äù on. I had enough respect for you to thoroughly answer your question &amp; tell you where coming from but you didn‚Äôt seem to offer anything to counter?
@KingofHype @JayRoy08 You need a better gathering system

@ben_rosen @AlUCanEatShrimp I mean that just would never have occurred to me to do. Amazing.
@kevinseccia Well, HEARING the word censorship
@ben_rosen This is an incredible find
@RheaButcher Uh  THE MARKET  *smoke bomb*
@RheaButcher Um maybe you didn‚Äôt read his heartfelt apology where he did not forgive himself for exploiting their admiration for him
@KingofHype @JayRoy08 You are really jumping though hoops for this guy who, by the way, is doing absolutely fine. Your arguments have gotten weaker and weaker over the course of this conversation. Why is it so important to YOU that no one criticize him?
@ktownjerome Hahahaha sure
@Natesaturday Not all, no.
@JayRoy08 If it makes you feel any better the market seems to be on Louis‚Äô side! CONGRATS!
@JayRoy08 If he continues to get booked it‚Äôs because the pressure of the market wasn‚Äôt enough to keep him off stage, which is what seems to be happening. THIS IS THE MARKET, even if you don‚Äôt like it or think it seems unfair.
@JayRoy08 Again, THIS IS NOT CENSORSHIP. This is not Lenny Bruce. People saying they don‚Äôt like him performing &amp; that they think he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to perform‚Äî THAT‚ÄôS THE MARKET. They DON‚ÄôT LIKE HIM.
@JayRoy08 The fact that now he‚Äôs doing material about even more marginalized people and in such a lazy way is making it worse. And the market IS deciding, so what‚Äôs YOUR concern?
@JayRoy08 People are allowed to criticize him by saying he should go away. Do you understand why they feel that way? It‚Äôs not just about what he did in the past. It‚Äôs about him not addressing it, not showing any remorse, sometimes making HIMSELF out to be the victim. That‚Äôs all part of it.
@KingofHype @somefishpun23 @JayRoy08 Just one final word: ‚Äúadmission of guilt‚Äù and ‚Äúacceptance of responsibility‚Äù are not quite the same thing.
@KingofHype @somefishpun23 @JayRoy08 You want to give this guy a pass, go ahead. But don‚Äôt try to sell anyone else that bullshit. You don‚Äôt think it was that big a deal, what he did. That‚Äôs your thing, right?
@KingofHype @somefishpun23 @JayRoy08 I not only read it, I understood it. He says a bunch of things that was accused of happened. He admitted responsibility. He did not apologize. The closest he comes is ‚ÄúI do not forgive MYSELF for that.‚Äù
@KingofHype @JayRoy08 He literally did not apologize https://t.co/Ecz7UBFt5T
@JayRoy08 What kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù was this supposed to be? ‚ÄúSo you admit you don‚Äôt think Louis should be performing again!‚Äù Why is that such an extreme take? He is an unrepentant abuser. Of course people feel that way.
@JayRoy08 I guess what YOU are saying is that everyone needs to just shut up because Louis is back and he is great and what he did wasn‚Äôt that bad if he even did it in the first place
@JayRoy08 Do you think you‚Äôre making an amazing point by intimating that some people are saying Louis shouldn‚Äôt be allowed on stage? They‚Äôre allowed to say that. They are not the government.
@DiegoEspinoza60 Hey Diego, leave me alone man, David is saying stupid shit and now so are you
What is ‚Äúde facto censorship?‚Äù Saying ‚Äúthis sucks?‚Äù That sounds like the market deciding to me, Axe! Also, people are showing up to see him &amp; club owners are putting him on, so you can go back to whatever it is you do now without further worrying about poor Louis! https://t.co/TcvIaZKFwX

@talklew @zdroberts Go reread the thread I guess, bud
@MoccasinWalter Ah. My fault for engaging.
@talklew @zdroberts Ya couldn‚Äôt do it Lew! But I hope you‚Äôll take our conversation to heart and begin forming a plan for how you‚Äôll react if (god forbid) a person more successful than you jerks off in front of you at work, never apologizes and suffers no serious repercussions!
@MoccasinWalter What is the point of satirizing anything I guess? That might be a problem for me and my line of work? I also never said you were a demon?
@talklew @zdroberts Lew.  üíØ
@talklew @zdroberts Lew. IF SOMEONE DID THIS TO YOU, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR  EXPECTATION OF WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TO INDICATE REMORSE. This is the third time I‚Äôve asked you this very simple question. Answer it or drop this altogether.
@talklew @zdroberts We have zero evidence that that happened. No one has said ‚ÄúHe apologised to me probately.‚Äù And why wouldn‚Äôt he mention that himself? Why wouldn‚Äôt ANYONE mention that, under this circumstances? All of a sudden he‚Äôs a discreet gentleman? This is chivalry, that what you‚Äôre saying?
@talklew @zdroberts And he never, ever says I‚ÄôM SORRY.
@talklew @zdroberts Saying ‚Äúyes I did this‚Äù isn‚Äôt the same as apologizing. And he says the power he had over them was THEIR ADMIRATION FOR HIM. No mention of the work status imbalance (or his reps intimidating the victims into silence). Again, if someone did this to you, Lew, what would YOU want?
@masiellonj Yes... my quotation marks indicate it‚Äôs a direct quote. So *I* didn‚Äôt begin the sentence. Perhaps you meant ‚Äú*one* would begin the sentence...‚Äù  Is that what you meant? Forgive me, do you understand the use of ‚Äúone‚Äù in this context?
@42HankScorpio I SAID IT‚ÄôS NOT ABOUT TIME
@masiellonj Quotation marks
@MoccasinWalter I think that the word is out and that my ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù won‚Äôt be what keeps Louis successful
Walkie-talkies will always be THE BEST https://t.co/j67q7tiZgT
@anne_theriault I am a great deal older than your son and I still have‚Äôt gotten over them
@zdroberts @talklew I think LewüíØ meant ‚Äúpunching up‚Äù as in ‚Äúworking on material‚Äù
@talklew @zdroberts Pretty weak answer, Lew! A mealy-mouthed response worthy of Louis himself! (Scan the ‚Äúapology‚Äù for the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚ÄúI apologize.‚Äù Closest you‚Äôll find is ‚ÄúI do not forgive myself for this.‚Äù What??)   A shame, really thought you‚Äôd keep it, as your handle suggests, üíØ! https://t.co/HR3BuKqNhR
@talklew @zdroberts And he issues a blanket ‚ÄúWhat I did was wrong‚Äù(without actually saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry) and then 9 months later he goes back to work, doesn‚Äôt acknowledge what he did to you at first, then makes HIMSELF the victim, then nothing? What would YOU want him to do? (2/2)
@talklew @zdroberts Why do you believe his apology to be sincere? If someone in a position of power jerked off in front of you, had his representative intimidate you into silence, then years later when enough stories build up around the guy &amp; he‚Äôs forced to admit it (1/2)
@talklew @zdroberts You think taking nine months off does the trick? Let me ask you, what makes YOU the moral arbiter that says it‚Äôs cool that he‚Äôs back like nothing happened, why just it he that people are ‚Äúspiteful of his success?‚Äù
@talklew @zdroberts Yes, you asked me what he could do and I responde: SOMETHING. Let me ask you, what has he done to indicate he is remorseful for the pain and harm he has caused? What has he done to indicate he even understands?
@zdroberts Big, big sign
@zdroberts Also the zero remorse
@talklew @zdroberts Who said anything about timing?
@talklew @zdroberts I guess the kinky thing I need him to do is SOMETHING. Look, I get that he‚Äôs your hero. Maybe write him a nice letter and he‚Äôll jerk off at you someday. It‚Äôs not that bad!!
@talklew @zdroberts No, THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES is that judge
@talklew @zdroberts He also fucked with peoples‚Äô careers. He treated them like garbage. You want to give him credit for not penetrating people, intimidating them into silence &amp; then eventually telling the truth after lying for years, shine on, you crazy diamond!
@talklew @zdroberts He doesn‚Äôt seem to have any remorse or to have demonstrated that he‚Äôs learned anything from the terrible experiences he inflicted on other people, that‚Äôs like the main thing
@Brocklesnitch That‚Äôs the worst part
@Brocklesnitch I‚Äôm only teasing you!
@talklew @zdroberts Also good to know you have a personal depravity scale
@talklew @zdroberts I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs so much people being spiteful of his success as it is he was not just accused of things but admitted to all of them after threatening people to keep quiet, brah
@Brocklesnitch Sounds like you‚Äôre just about done!
@zdroberts It‚Äôs actually less about economics and/or timing &amp; perhaps more about not being a sociopath, but I think that‚Äôs a taller order.
@LadyKateBond Yeeeeeep

@krinklyfig @johnlevenstein @BrianStack153 Only because Elvis made a last-minute decision to play that song rather than the one he‚Äôd done at rehearsal. It had nothing to do with the content of the song; Lorne doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äúsurprises."

@johnlevenstein @BrianStack153 Indeed. I was not trying to equate the intentions. Just wanted to get in some jabs at old school SNL.
@johnlevenstein @BrianStack153 How about when Belushi mocked Joe Cocker during Joe Cocker‚Äôs performance and Joe Cocker had to force a smile because it was live television.
@Bathilde77 Oh no you are using my own tactic against me
@Bathilde77 GREAT gif
@Bathilde77 GREAT point
@Bathilde77 Maybe you should have lead with that?
@Bathilde77 Ok
@Bathilde77 I‚Äôd urge you to reconsider the ‚Äúanyone who wanted to could come‚Äù approach to wedding invitations as it could impact your special day negatively.
@Bathilde77 We got married at the home of a family friend. We did have the food catered and hired a DJ, though. And we rented a tent in case of rain. It was pretty reasonable and everyone had a great time.
@Bathilde77 It was because that was your repeated argument and I wanted to know why you thought that.
@Bathilde77 But no reception, right?
@Bathilde77 You actually don‚Äôt get it but maybe some day you will!
@Bathilde77 Right, but even when it‚Äôs not ‚Äúlavish‚Äù it still costs money to feed people and provide them with drinks and dancing.
@Bathilde77 The reason I asked if you‚Äôd had a wedding is because it sounded   like you had an idea about what throwing a wedding involve but didn‚Äôt have the actual experience of putting one together.
@Bathilde77 It all weddings are gift grabs, either. My wife and I were not kids when we got married, so we weren‚Äôt asking people to give us blenders and such. We just wanted people to be there for the party. No one had a problem with not bringing their kids. Most people understand.
@Bathilde77 So once you remove little kids from the equation, things get easier for pretty much everybody. People who ignore a directive and WANT to bring their small children to weddings are the outliers.
@Bathilde77 Then, we decided no kids. Beyond just the cost concern, it was also about the experience we wanted people to have at our wedding, We love kids, but little kids are a lot of work. Most people, 99.9%, are thrilled to leave the kids at home and go to a party. It‚Äôs true!
@Bathilde77 Keep in mind, you believe it is stupid to spend thousands of dollars on a wedding.
@Bathilde77 My wife and I both have tons of cousins. We love our cousins but it was just too many people if we were going to invite our immediate families and the people in our daily lives. Are we selfish assholes for not inviting the cousins?
@Bathilde77 @JessicaHuseman Anyway, the guest list for a wedding is a complicated thing; it depends on how many people you both know, family, friends, etc. No matter the size of the wedding, the guest list has to be figured out. So first you have figure out which adults you‚Äôre inviting.
@Bathilde77 @JessicaHuseman Sorry, I did not in fact see your response at first. Here‚Äôs how it looked to me: https://t.co/8g2ymJohZY
@Bathilde77 It‚Äôs late where I am so I‚Äôm gong to sleep now but I‚Äôll happily pick this up tomorrow if you actually want to have a discussion! Answer my question first and the I‚Äôll answer yours and we‚Äôll go from there. I hope you find that fair!
@Bathilde77 @JessicaHuseman Oh and forgive me: thank YOU for not answering as well!
@Bathilde77 @JessicaHuseman To be fair, you didn‚Äôt answer my question first, which really got the negation ball rolling.
@Bathilde77 @JessicaHuseman Ugh I thought we were actually going to have a conversation. My mistake!
@a_smyth @TVsAndyDaly @alicewetterlund @StephAllynne Oof
@Bathilde77 @JessicaHuseman Happy to oblige. Why do you assume people why have kid-free weddings are ‚Äúselfish assholes?‚Äù

@ScottAukerman https://t.co/UiGNiP3Pfb
@ScottAukerman are u dead yet
@klausWW1T Hey Klaus thanks for the attempted lesson in death but I‚Äôm all growed up now
I thought maybe he‚Äôd be on here &amp; I wanted to write &amp; tell him that, but it‚Äôs a hard name to search here. So I googled him &amp; our school &amp; our graduating year. And there you go. So whoever is reading this, know that Robert Evans was great in that production!
Robert‚Äôs final scene in the show was him on stage alone. Crusty Mr. Dawes Senior is all by himself, remembering a joke the Banks kids have told him. And Robert Evans performed the most natural stage laugh I have ever seen to this day.
My classmate Robert Evans, a wonderful singer, played the role of Mr. Dawes Senior, the elderly banker. In the movie, both of our roles were played by Dick Van Dyke! #aspoonfuloftrivia
I essayed the role of Bert, the chimney sweep. My favorite moment to play was the scene where Bert sings a sad, ‚ÄúCat‚Äôs Cradle‚Äù-type reprise of ‚ÄúSpoonful of Sugar‚Äù to Mr. Banks (a character I have massive empathy for now as an adult, despite having no children).
I just watched ‚ÄúMary Poppins Returns‚Äù and remembered doing a show called ‚ÄúThe Practically Perfect Nanny‚Äù in high school. This was well before the official, licensed Mary Poppins musical. Basically the film script of the 1964 film hastily converted into a stage show.
For the first time in decades I looked up a high school classmate only to learn that he is dead. But it‚Äôs still 2018 so I‚Äôm not going to read into it as a harbinger of the new year.
@chapka thank u, next https://t.co/2qveSNdvx4

My hazy memory is that it was a morning show, possibly England or Australia. The puppet was (to me) an extremely generic puppet, not a world-renown character. The topic turned to, like, kids with cancer or something.
@danawickens Yeah!

Oh no that must make the murder 100% not a crime and also maybe good, thanks for this legal clarification, I am not a lawyer, I just own a seersucker suit https://t.co/sIzwqn0fya

I had to delete and repost because I confused Amy Grant with Martina McBride, but to be fair I bet they often think they are each other too

@nwalks His righteous anger burns brighter than a thousand tannenbaums
Anyone in these mentions critiquing Reba herself and not the material can go to city music Hell. I am addressing this monologue because Reba deserves better.
@nwalks ...How‚Äôd it go?
Why would you ask ‚ÄúWhat would Santa do‚Äù and then call Santa and tell him what you are going to do? So, Santa would ask his own permission to do a song about himself? Come on. Someone in country music must have a connection to Bruce Vilanch.
Okay so Reba destroys with some material about modern kids &amp; how they deal with Santa but then her premise at the end loses its logic? Reba, I want you to succeed. https://t.co/0RwaE0Blrb

Okay, I thought I posted my last tweet of 2018 and could take the year off, but some dumb goons don‚Äôt seem to understand that ‚Äúcluck cluck‚Äù is not a chicken noise. ‚ÄúBark bark‚Äù is not a dog sound. You dumb goons.
@RetroCanada You probably deleted this when you realized that ‚Äúcluck cluck‚Äù is how dumb goons spell ‚Äúbok bok‚Äù https://t.co/qNolw6Ht4j

@yayforzig ‚ÄúArthur is not just a king. He is the Once and Future King. Take heart, for when Albion's need is greatest: Arthur will rise again.‚Äù
@SainteEph I guess this is a sick burn? I am not familiar with that network. Hey, I‚Äôm sorry that guy you don‚Äôt like knows who I am and that I responded to what I assumed was your snarky joke but now I am starting to think that maybe none of it was a joke?
@SainteEph Didn‚Äôt think you could top yourself but happy to be proven wrong
@SainteEph GREAT comeback
@SainteEph What does it say about you that I didn‚Äôt who he was until you tweeted me
@CoutureRicky @yayforzig Kevin Hart is not ‚Äúcanceled.‚Äù He is just not hosting the Oscars. Just as those women aren‚Äôt. And presumably weren‚Äôt asked.
@CoutureRicky @yayforzig I‚Äôm not giving anyone a pass for ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù jokes, btw‚Äî just pointing out that the point of a joke is what makes all the difference. Also? Not for nothing? All three of those women have been taken to task for their material on many occasions.
@CoutureRicky @yayforzig Also, if you want to line up the jokes of many comedians side by side, it‚Äôs important to know what makes a joke homophobic and what makes a joke ABOUT homophobia. I‚Äôd absolutely be able to tell the difference, would you?
@CoutureRicky @yayforzig This tweet. Why would I refer to the tweet you responsed to as ‚Äúthe next tweet‚Äù https://t.co/IXchLc5Jmh
Just saw a video of a lizard being confused by seeing himself in a mirror &amp; started wondering which animals eventually ‚Äúget‚Äù mirrors, but that idea was quickly hijacked by wondering if animals who learn what mirrors are have the ability to feel superior to the ones that don‚Äôt.
@CoutureRicky @yayforzig The Oscars are a self-important awards show that are watched by many people because they are about popular entertainment. There have been many issues about appropriateness of the hosts‚Äô material after the fact; the biggest anomaly here is that it‚Äôs happening before.
@CoutureRicky @yayforzig Can you imagine if you read my very next tweet
@yayforzig Also, smart that no one in the Nick Cannon Trust has never been homophobic in any way, because they might accidentally be making the case that homophobia is bad no matter who it comes from
@yayforzig They have a point, though‚Äî Chelsea, Amy and Sarah should step down as the triple hosts of the Oscars.

@BillCorbett @twittels It couldn‚Äôt be more understandable. Like, even if you haven‚Äôt heard the one-line explanation of the concept, when you are THINKING about adding the hashtag, don‚Äôt you have to wonder if the ‚Äúhumble‚Äù part applies?

@DaveHolmes Even as a kid I remember being mortified by it.
‚ÄúAlso ‚ÄòTwinkle Twinkle Little Star‚Äô is ‚ÄòFarmer In The Dell.‚Äô And the alphabet. Most songs are ‚ÄòFarmer In The Dell‚Äô because it contains the basic song structure that science knows from history.‚Äù
I haven‚Äôt seen this since I was a child and wondered if it was a regional thing? My friend Samantha was intrigued enough to research it &amp; sent me this: https://t.co/wJslQC6fxS
Went to a wedding this weekend &amp; was reminded of the practice of the wedding band playing &amp; singing ‚ÄúThe bride cuts the cake, the bride cuts the caaaake‚Äù to the tune of ‚ÄúFarmer In The Dell.‚Äù All actions were narrated to this tune for the cake-cutting sequence.
@BAKKOOONN In the story I named my horse ‚ÄúBarb‚Äù and when I went to play through again I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to use the same name so I typed in ‚ÄúBarb Jr‚Äù and they told me it was profanity? I added punctuation &amp; they accepted ‚ÄúBarb, Jr.‚Äù

@max_harvey Why
1) This is my second tweet about Christmas music in a week 2) I don‚Äôt know that saying something is happening is a ‚Äútake‚Äù 3) Congrats on settling Mars, I guess? https://t.co/axGRXykWPR
It‚Äôs extra work that I don‚Äôt need as part of my day.
It‚Äôs more annoying to experience than I can convey to you and certainly more so than I would have thought.
So this is new: this Christmas season, whenever I hear certain sections of instrumental versions of ‚ÄúChristmas (Baby Please Come Home)‚Äù I think it‚Äôs ‚ÄúSkid Row (Downtown)‚Äù from Little Shop Of Horrors.
@LPizzle I have zero context for this but it delighted me enough to RT. All I can say is if Tommy Lee is indeed claiming to have invented the rollercoaster, he is definitely LYING.

To be fair, some of these people may be walking around with their home pillows because they don‚Äôt trust 1) the pillow at their ultimate destination 2) airport baggage handlers to not steal their magical pillow
Then other people seeing that person at the airport and thinking ‚ÄúIt is worth looking like a weirdo carrying my home pillow around in public if this works, which it must.‚Äù

@woody_wolfpack @ChaseMit Maybe advise the person to take down the ‚Äúwhoever did this‚Äù tweet instead of keeping everyone else up to date, because it‚Äôs not about singling out that one person, it‚Äôs about many many people doing this exact thing
@theworldisflatt @ChaseMit Maybe if it had been phrased as a question that could have happened but the person didn‚Äôt actually seem that interested in finding out

It was also great to hang out with  so many other nice folks after the Sunday show, when we did what Superego usually does: hang out in a bar scanning through the movie Bugsy Malone on a phone to see if any children actually die as a result of cream pie attack.

@JayAlver @wool_potatoes @ashleyfeinberg Yeah I think everyone gets that part, it‚Äôs that it took them so long to seize on that
@lena_moss @dadlac Uh WOW
@hodgman I‚Äôm rolling down my window
The point is, @TheRock is great and always has been. https://t.co/ZEb7ARertW
He was a delight and he threw me though a window (mostly offscreen)   https://t.co/BUqvlG7Iwr
Then he looked up and said, ‚ÄúJust kidding. I know how to read.‚Äù
We all sat down to read the script. When it came for The Rock‚Äôs first line, he struggled to sound out the words. Everyone froze and eye contact between anyone did not happen anywhere in the building.
D‚ÄùTR‚ÄùJ was beginning his transition from wrestling to acting. He was definitely a wrestling STAR at this point &amp; it was a big deal to get him for our new show. He came to the table read &amp; met everyone beforehand &amp; was super nice and friendly, as we all now know he is.
Holy moly, thank you to @andygordon3000 for reminding me of this little story: all the way back in the year 2000, I was a regular on an NBC sitcom called ‚ÄúDAG‚Äù  [applause dies down]  And on one episode, one of our guest stars was Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson.
Happening now: The young lady sitting next to me on the plane sneezed &amp; I said ‚ÄúBless you‚Äù &amp; she thanked me then she immediately sneezed again &amp; I said ‚ÄúYou only get one‚Äù and oh she did NOT laugh
@HarMarSuperstar @NickSwardson Look, I LOVE Minnesota, but you don‚Äôt see Nick moving back there to shovel snow &amp; die of heat prostration.
@zylalovesyou You have your orders
Minnesota: wrong on living in Minnesota for two out of four seasons, wrong on Duck Duck Goose https://t.co/nzkJvOfhNk
‚ÄúI actually think Hydrox are better that Ore‚Äî‚Äú  Go choke on a Sierra Mist
‚ÄúDid you know Hydrox was actually firs‚Äî‚Äú YES
Don‚Äôt come into my mentions with your Hydrox kindergarten games https://t.co/sscub7QGut
@claudiastrater @jkread3 To be fair I spelled it correctly in the hashtag so you‚Äôre both WHO CARES
Please don‚Äôt call me an ‚ÄúNPC‚Äù it is a very hurtful &amp; effective insult and PLEASE if I am sitting in a circle with others do not tap me and yell ‚ÄúGOOSE‚Äù think of the discourse for god‚Äôs sake
@petersagal To quote David ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù Gregory, you are welcome to do your own research.
@petersagal How do you know what movie I‚Äôm talking about?
*texting me back. I am rage-typing now.
This is funny, but the quotation marks clearly imply it is Bill speaking. Also, although I‚Äôm sorry I did this to you, if this is how it feels to respond seriously to a joke, I gotta say, I get it now. WHAT A RUSH https://t.co/uteaSflNl9
Re my first tweet, I guess #JasonMantzoukas has lost the respect of autocorrect, despite his name definitely being in my phone as proven by my texting him and his still not text me back
I wish more of my colleagues were not on this app, I have a lot to say about a lot of people
It is freeing to badmouth him publicly know he can‚Äôt see this. BE CONSIDERATE, #JASONMANTZOUKAS
Jason Mantoukas is not on twitter but he IS on my last nerve for making me wait for a text back. #JasonMantzoukas
@johnlewinski Apology accepted, thank you.
‚ÄúWill #GeorgeSoros make it rain frogs like in a movie I saw?‚Äù https://t.co/cj26ZlI8XC

@MsSarahGuzzardo @southphillyexp Hey sorry I never responded to this 9 years ago
@danawickens https://t.co/hOroDOVs8i
@KarenKilgariff @richardrushfield @johnlevenstein (I was lying on John‚Äôs show.)
@johnlewinski Yeah, just a little quarrel. Tell your sister hello! https://t.co/j0qMets7eX
@ashleyfeinberg A really cringey part is that this is their best deviation from insults that are really only effective when they use them on each other
@IRodC Directed by @mrbobodenkirk. He talks about it here. https://t.co/X3f9ckkBNa https://t.co/pxDvJPGfXL
@spies_please It is right and just and good that you are doing this and also I have never muted a conversation faster in my life
@DaraMWilson @Pat_Healy @ScottAukerman @laurenlapkus https://t.co/xSkcSxB32C
@erinandtrev @starwars @BenBlacker @bnacker @janiehaddad Aw!
@Bro_Pair I also just realized I screencapped the wrong tweet so this sucks all around https://t.co/iFK8vGlhHX
@notoffthegrid @JohnRossBowie Oh god no. Just the voice. The puppeteer was a brilliant artist named Ron Binion.
@RobertKFOX14 You little creep. You think I didn‚Äôt feel your intrusive journalist eyes on me at every turn. You‚Äôre worse than the peacocks.
Just met a young woman named Cassiopeia, bring my total up to 1 career Cassiopeia
Aw crumbs. I tweeted as fast as I could! https://t.co/fYrI8HP1mV
‚ÄúWho are there guys, anyway?‚Äù Something like that. Maybe ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll never make it!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI liked their earlier stuff.‚Äù
RIP Stan Lee. Now he gets to cameo as an audience member watching that Great Rock &amp; Roll Jam in Heaven.
Ep 190 of Spontaneanation is a Good Place to have fun! With interview guest @jameelajamil &amp; improvisors Marc Evan Jackson &amp; Maribeth Monroe! Listen on up! https://t.co/2XYbm2bWBM
@aquasad1 @Ryan__JW Do you feel the need to defend groups of bigots since you disagree with me politically?
@KPack1972 It‚Äôs literally the least he could do considering he is responsible for their deaths.
@ScottAukerman So disappointed to discover you ripped off your whole thing from this idiot protesting the 2000 Florida recount. https://t.co/hgiV1xluYv
@themattylee @HussardTailleur @Slate Perfect pairing of delivery with profile pic https://t.co/Qn18Wql6sB
@minimark Okay you don‚Äôt seem to be acknowledging any of the points that have been made and just keep assigning intentions to people, so maybe we‚Äôve had enough conversation.
@minimark WHY. ARE. YOU. YELLING.
@minimark @RheaButcher @SarahKSilverman @BetoORourke No one is demeaning anyone, unless you count George W Bush having the gall to make any comments on Veterans Day, today or any time in the future.
@minimark @RheaButcher @SarahKSilverman @BetoORourke I also think I made a point about not forgetting as we look forward.
@minimark @RheaButcher @SarahKSilverman @BetoORourke You understand that the absence of a draft doesn‚Äôt preclude a needless war or two, right?
@minimark @RheaButcher @SarahKSilverman @BetoORourke Do you think he truly cares about vets because he needlessly made so many of them? Looking forward also means not forgetting so we don‚Äôt end up in the same place we‚Äôve been before.
@AliciaATobin You‚Äôve changed
@AliciaATobin So hurtful
@HussardTailleur @Slate Agreed
@HussardTailleur @Slate I think it‚Äôs actually a step below yelling at people in restaurants. I prefer public shaming to scaring kids. Don‚Äôt kink-shame me.
@AliciaATobin How would my saying I liked Holy Water be making fun of you, YOU WEIRDO
@AliciaATobin Oh, I also liked Holy Water!
@AliciaATobin I liked the drama of The Stations but they should have cut a couple out, IMHO
@Slate I will agree that chanting shit like ‚ÄúWe know where you live‚Äù is menacing and irresponsible (and redundant, you‚Äôre outside his house). I just saw the video and cringed.
@BurkeHall @johnlevenstein We have squirrels in the neighborhood but they don‚Äôt seem interested!
@WarMachine78 @Slate Yes, I responded to you.
@AliciaATobin The incense was one of the things I actually liked!
@NebFeminists @JaredRizzi I‚Äôm sorry if your being in the jewelry business means you feel compelled to defend class rings by insulting grown adults who are mocking them, this must be a terrible burden for you.
@NebFeminists @JaredRizzi Hi I don‚Äôt know what your point is or was
@WarMachine78 Thank you. Ugh. That is threatening language. That was not included in the coverage of the police report that I read.
@NebFeminists @JaredRizzi Oh good call the only reason people thing class rings are dumb is because they‚Äôre ashamed of being poor?
@nochillcale I was a catholic school kid
Just heard my first ‚ÄúRockin‚Äô Around The Christmas Tree‚Äù of the year and it made me feel the resigned misery of when I was a kid and knew I was powerless over going to Mass.
@WarMachine78 @Slate Show me
@johnlevenstein We have been lucky‚Äî every year we get a pumpkin as part of our Halloween decorations, and then November 1st we remove everything but the pumpkin for Thanksgiving-y purposes. And it lasts! Because we do not carve it.
@GeneralPSwine @Slate Thanks for the follow
@pattymo Thank you for bringing this into my life
