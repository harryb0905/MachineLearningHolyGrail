Degenkolb amazing ride!  @GregVanAvermaet your the man !
Can still come.back together ...
Degenkolb  probably faster on paper . In roubaix after 260k all is different . Especially from a break .
Degenkolb  amazing bridge !! Etixx may start sitting on .. director won't let him pull I'm sure ..
Go.@GregVanAvermaet !!
Next section not that selective , but some sharp stones on the sides . Possible flats .
"@rhyspencer: @ghincapie that's a large group this late! Velodrome group sprint?"I think so .
In training everyone rides in the middle . At this point in race your just looking for any line that may be smoother.
The section is awful . At this point your  bones feel like they are coming loose . Everything hurts .
Lotto looking good . Sep must be feeling it ...
Bmc- katusha will start working together  need to go now ..
Directors on radio now saying do not let this go .. impresive move by Wiggins . Group unorganized behind .
"@MatthewKutilek: @ghincapie is this near the sector where your bars snapped off?"yep !
THis is a good move ! Without @f_cancellara and @tomboonen1 we may see a big group sprint still at the finish .
My buddie @manuelquinziato looking good . Awesome teammate !!
Big group still= more crashes . Guys are getting tired, reaction time is slower .. I've spent time in some of those ditches .
@f_cancellara I saw they just went past your favorite sector .. not the same without you ..
"@dwuori: @ghincapie Sagan pooped, bunch of guys skipped through a railroad crossing."wow .. he looks good now .
Had to get a quick ride in , what did I miss ?
"@redlandsClassic: The Stage 4 results : Brendan Rhim @calgiantcycling -new us classic star in the making . Congrats buddie!

Hope you recover well from your crash  @MBurghardt83 ! Thinking of you . The team needs the bulldozer. ..
Not sure what to think about today . There will be a lot of unhappy riders tonight .
Looks like Contador bonked . So much energy spent in this stage . Short stage ,but tons of nervous energy spent .
Maybe not , boom flying ..
@f_cancellara can bridge up in next section .
"@FreddyG819: @ghincapie enjoyed the interview on Quebec french station @RDSca #velords Next year will you do it in french? :P"thank you !

"@trentcycles: @ghincapie not even the Passage du Gois?"nope , not even close .
"@chorltonjohn7: @ghincapie Are you missing it George? Madness!"no.
"@commish24: @ghincapie Must take a real psychological &amp; emotional toll as well as the physical beating."Correct !!
After today's flat 160k stage , riders will be more exhausted after today, then any other stage in rest of the TDF.
"@thenevadan: @ghincapie Reminiscent of Paris-Roubaix 2001, eh?"the roads weren't that slick then . Just the pave .
"@KevinTranz: @ghincapie One of those days when you are glad you're no longer in the peleton? #tdf2014"yes !!
Don't believe I ever experienced a stage this crazy in all my TDFs .
Seriously slick out there . Doesn't get much more stressful then this in the Peloton .
Watch @michaelschaer and @MBurghardt83 helping @tejay_van today before the sectors. They are some of the  best in the biz at positioning.
@RANDYOWENS69 @richhincapie you sure that wasnt Rich ? He's been on that crazy crash diet . You never know .
@f_cancellara @tomboonen1 @letour You know better then anyone. Good luck my friend.
@MBurghardt83   you know what to do. I'll be watching . Keep our boy @tejay_van where he needs to be .As och would say.Don't f it up.
Last 10k of the first stage of TDF may look fairly calm on tv . It's not . #Craziness! !
