"This is their moment and their reactions tend to be more spontaneous and emotional and unfiltered than anything else. Never take that away from them. Never give the impression you're taking that away from them." -@TheFienPrint  #Oscars https://t.co/GeRBjgCVw2

#MaryPoppinsReturns is really sweet &amp; very well done. Reminds you of watching the original as a kid. Actual fun for the whole family. My nephew &amp; nieces were smiling the whole time. I would imagine it gets even better the more times you see it, as the songs become more familiar.

#Vice possible Oscar nominations: Best Picture. Director @GhostPanther. Original Screenplay @GhostPanther. Actor #ChristianBale. Supporting Actor #SamRockwell. Supporting Actress #AmyAdams.
With #Vice, director #AdamMcKay (@GhostPanther) makes you interested in a topic you didn't know you could (or should) care about. #DickCheney might be the biggest villain in any movie this year. You never feel like you're watching #ChristianBale as Cheney or #SamRockwell as Bush.

FACT CHECK: President Sauli Niinistö of Finland told Ilta-Sanomat on Sunday that he never discussed raking with Trump during their brief meeting in Paris last week. “I mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests &amp; we also have a good monitoring system &amp; network.” https://t.co/VKqpQ3w7FM
If there’s anyone dumber than @realDonaldTrump, I have yet to find them.  He has the audacity to blame the fires here in California on the forests needing to be raked 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/1hEAozZiGo

Exactly. https://t.co/Aqtq7zDQCS
The bottom line is this:  If @realDonaldTrump wasn’t “President”, none of these horrific things would be happening.  He spreads hate, fuels conspiracy theories, and empowers lunatics.  Get him out of office. https://t.co/vwqCOSFC62

When #BrettKavanaugh lies, he twitches his nose.  #KavanaughHearings
Why doesn't #BrettKavanaugh want an FBI investigation if he's innocent?  #KavanaughHearings

#LifeItself (like life itself) is full of unexpected twists &amp; turns. Different stories intertwined. Makes you think. If you like #ThisIsUs, you’ll like #LifeItself. Heartfelt writing &amp; directing by @Dan_Fogelman (He got me with a dog scene). Glad I got to see it with my parents.

"If the Academy plans to define popularity by gross, the problem is holiday releases open in time to qualify but fatten up grosses after the award is presented. The Greatest Showman is a good example: when it opened December 20 who knew it would gross $434 million?" @DeadlineMike https://t.co/OHkNFGEYfY
If they absolutely have to do this...  How about calling it an "Audience Award" like film festivals do?  Instead of "Most Popular"  Audience votes online.

Why the cringeworthy TV show descriptions?   &lt;&lt;“I Feel Bad” follows Emet, the perfect mom, boss, wife, friend and daughter. OK, she’s not perfect.

2 years ago today, it was love at first sight. Before I took Buddy home, I picked him up, looked him in the eyes, and told him "I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll figure it out." 2 years later, I'd say we've figured it out together... 😘🐶 https://t.co/XPBw6Ccg2s https://t.co/QDOikHYTK8
Correction: "He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the Trump administration"  Therefore, @realDonaldTrump needed him to go.  Just 2 days before his retirement (&amp; 50th birthday) when he would get the pension he earned after 21 years of service https://t.co/f65BQzMOaJ

Dear @kingsthings,  What can we do to save @NateNAl's?  It's been a Beverly Hills institution since 1945.  73 years!  It should not change locations.  (Norm's on La Cienega was deemed a "Historic-Cultural Monument" and it's only been there since 1957)  Sincerely, @BrettGursky

"Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President." @realDonaldTrump   "This tweet was made by @AlferovaYulyaE, a woman with strong connections to the Kremlin in 2014." @EdKrassen  Why lie about that? 🤔 https://t.co/UKna1BPuTs
The truth has always been that Russia offered to help you win the election in exchange for not putting sanctions on Russia once you were President.  This began way back in November 2013 when you brought the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow.  Still no sanctions.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9kIrT9L1uk

Also, this is just your thinly-veiled attempt at bashing @JeffBezos, who owns both @Amazon &amp; the @WashingtonPost.   And we all know how you feel about the @WashingtonPost.  Also, no one else agrees. https://t.co/ertaAmqV6f

#Jumanji is a really fun movie. A sequel, not a reboot. Nice throwback to the body-switching comedies of the '80s &amp; '90s. Clever to see teenagers trapped inside @TheRock @KevinHart4Real #JackBlack &amp; @KarenGillan. My nephew especially loved it.  (cc @ScottyRosenberg @chineseguy88)

No one ever stopped saying it.  There was also never an assault against the phrase, so you haven't had to lead any charge.  This is just another lame attempt at trying to divide people.  p.s. Look at all your old tweets that say "Happy Holidays"  @realDonaldTrump #thegrinch https://t.co/hTL93Rupog
#MollysGame possible Oscar noms: Best Picture. Actress @jes_chastain. Adapted Screenplay #AaronSorkin.
Loved #MollysGame. Have always wondered about the inner workings of those infamous poker games. Certain aspects of Hollywood hit close to home. Appreciated all the LA locations. Great performances by @jes_chastain &amp; @idriselba &amp; directing by #AaronSorkin.
#TheGreatestShowman possible Oscar noms:  Best Picture. Actor @RealHughJackman.  Original Song #ThisIsMe #AMillionDreams #RewriteTheStars @pasekandpaul

“I refuse to believe that comedy can’t live on the big screen... I absolutely live in a world where comedies can get made and have to continue to get made. I just know it. The world is a super stressful place, and people just want to go to the theater and laugh.” -#MattTolmach https://t.co/JJDu3pGM3W
