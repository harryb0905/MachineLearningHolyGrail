Great night at the #CDGA https://t.co/79Q9lyMezH
It was my honor! 🙏🏻 https://t.co/PbWCHTFBue
@Frankymack1 I like a light amber ale like this one here.
@marksheehan17 Craft amber ale from a place called Bluebird Brasserie on Ventura Blvd in Sherman Oaks. It's a great spot. Delicious Bavarian craft beers made on the premises and really good food.
Cheers 🍻 #beeroclock https://t.co/ALnZsU8jd4

Having spent the day driving around in Los Angeles in the rain, my conclusion is that our species is pretty much doomed. #LArain
@ShieldShattered @actorbrianwhite I was there that night, mainly listening as they destroyed the apartment they were fighting in. Absolutely insane level of trust and commitment to each other and the work. We always went for the real. It was exhilarating!
@johnenright43 Early on and @actorbrianwhite did not disappoint! He was a champion and a stud just like his dad! #TheShield @ShieldShattered
@Jrams307 No! It’s a museum piece from the French impressionist period! I just think it’s beautiful.

@TheDorkyShane The people/audience can be critical of a performance, although being "critical" and being horrible are two different things. I'm saying fellow performers should think before they spout off at the gob! If anything we should be supportive of one another not tearing each other down.
For the record, I think it's so F-ed up to see celebrities ragging on the halftime performers. You do it! Armchair critic cowards! This is how twitter sucks. Everyone forgets what their parents taught them. If you have nothing good to say... STFU! Lest you be judged!

Dearest Josh, It is with humble gratitude that I suckle upon the sweet nectar of your hatred and drawing strength from it, direct this new found power in unbridled support of my beloved @Patriots that they might smite the @RamsNFL, in their mercy. #Amen #LoveYouToo #GoPats https://t.co/78CWPSG5Z9

@ShieldShattered @TheDannyPino @sutterink @TheKennyJohnson @ShawnRyanTV @CatherineDent @glenmazzara @skeeterosenbaum @TheShieldFX @drsnell The reason that scene worked was Danny. He trusted me. He gave me permission to get very physical with him, trusting that I would sell it but not take it too far, not hurt him. When people have a visceral reaction to the work, it’s thrilling. I want to move people, make them feel

@MrDavidQuinn @chrismcquarrie I could hear the theme in my head as watched this video! Haha! Make it happen Chris!
@Mark55964331 Haha! Vic would not do well in an ethical debate!
@Poetic_line *personal
@Poetic_line Yes but look more deeply into what I'm saying. We often want to be "right" in an argument so badly that we won't take responsibility for what we got wrong along the way. We justify, deflect &amp; deny. Simply put; two wrongs don't make a right. Personally accountability = credibility
@SlenderSherbet Dying!
Do not abandon your principles for the sake of being right. It's a more difficult path but it's the righteous one.
@AutumnChiklis @enrique7425 Ditto baby!
@szhooper Right. There's only one way to maintain the higher ground &amp; that's by holding ourselves to the highest standards of truth and integrity. Our public discourse is fraught with false equivalencies, justifications &amp; the assault on truth &amp; accountability. I won't do that.
@AprilTara There's clearly a lot more to this story. I won't defend myself when I'm wrong though and I was wrong.
@Tihocan3322 @JaredStarks3 For my part, this is not political. I'm speaking only to my own jump to judgement and owning that I was incorrect. The rest are separate issues.
@roasterchief23 Thanks for this Patrick. My heart was in the right place but sometimes that's still not enough. If we're ever going to come together in this country, this world, we have to take personal responsibility first and treat each other with dignity and decency.
@brood5 If that's true then that's on them. Had I been more discerning, my statement would have at the very least been different.
@AnthonySkordi Exactly Anthony.
@mind_noise Correct!
@Hoppalicious That's a different issue all together and has nothing to do with what I said, what they were being accused of and my taking personal responsibility for my own words. I don't believe in the notion of justifying no matter what. Two wrongs don't make a right.
@brood5 I don't agree with their politics but after seeing the whole video, they didn't start this thing and I past judgement prematurely. I have to own that.
I'm truly sorry I commented on this story. Facts matter. The truth matters and it's vitally important that we all take responsibility when we are wrong. I got sucked into a narrative that was incorrect and for that I apologize to the parents, teachers and kids involved. https://t.co/dV8RokDJQb
@SarahRedhead_Me @hasmatkid @foggybottomgal Wow okay I thought you were a legit person but since you're just trolling and not interested in making things better, bye bye!
Do you believe in miracles!?!? @Patriots https://t.co/xXNinI4i1K

@JBorzumato Dude you just made my Sunday!
@zstansbe @coachiggs Wait, that's not what happened either. False equivalency. This is a pointless discussion. I'm going to go enjoy my Sunday and the football. I hope you do too and I hope the school and the parents of these kids turn this into a teachable moment. Have a great weekend.
@coachiggs Let me ask you... would you ever get in an elderly man's face like that? Wouldn't you just back off in deference to his age? That's what I was taught. To respect my elders. Those boys making the tomahawk gesture &amp; imitating him? Come on. Don't defend the indefensible.
Haha! Awesome! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!! @Patriots https://t.co/0zaiIjXBwh
@coachiggs The first video I responded to didn't tell the whole story. I still believe a school chaperone should have been there to intervene &amp; that the boys were clearly mocking the old buck. He shouldn't have approached them though. So yes. I think we all need to calm down that's for sure
@JBorzumato 3. other apart. I just looked at the discourse from this thread alone and it makes me wonder how we'll ever get back on track. If you don't think things could completely break down, think again. This is dangerous &amp; we all need to recognize that &amp; behave like adults. Here's hoping
@JBorzumato 2. I hope that everyone steps away from this story now and lets the school and the parents try to turn this into a teachable moment. Bottom line; this is America now. Horribly divided and at each others throats over everything. Cooler heads need to prevail or we'll tear each
@JBorzumato 1. Wasn't to do with his hat. I just responded to a group of young men, seemingly surrounding an elderly man and gleefully mocking his indigenous song. I have since seen that he approached the boys &amp; his statement for doing so is gray. A chaperone should have intervened for sure.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the greatest team of all? What was that? The @Patriots you say? TB12 is on his way?  Can’t wait for tomorrow, I’m holding my breath, just hope they all don’t freeze to death! This’ll be fun, one hell of a show. Come on you @Patriots LET’S GOOOOO! https://t.co/tC5E5vQGrb

@CGachko @maxkellerman Re Max, I've held my tongue for a long time &amp; I finally hit the wall when I saw his rant last night. He's always been blatantly bias &amp; downright disrespectful with his comments about TB12 &amp; the Pats. Cock sure punk arrogance, yet he's consistently wildly incorrect. #Done
@CGachko @maxkellerman Glad to hear it but you are wrong in terms of his performance. Numbers are deceiving. Almost every int has been a tipped ball, team's been plagued by injuries, mental health issues etc. Fact is, being where they are is a testament to he &amp; coach B's prowess. #ColdObjectivity
@CGachko @maxkellerman Dude this has been years of this nonsense. I'm just tired of the bloviating while being so incredibly wrong. Whether the Pats win or lose, he's never been correct about any of it. Guess you're another TB12 hater. Hate him or not, tip your hat or you're embarrassing yourself too.
@maxkellerman You're really embarrassing yourself now Max. It's painful to watch you speak so effusively about football as if you actually know something about it. What's worse is your jealousy, contempt &amp; overt bias with regard to TB12. At this point it's downright cringe worthy. Hush now. 🤫

@richeisen Here's the thing. I'm not just a fanboy who doesn't want to recognize the truth about the situation. I'm very clear about this. Two things; Nothing is fundamentally broken in NE and No other team is so dominant and without troubles of their own that NE can't beat them. It's on!

@SmithCinm @Patriots @BumpNrunGilm0re That's a silly question.
Loyalty is a great word, a wonderful, admirable and all too rare quality. I won’t have it be usurped by villains or besmirched by the righteous. Loyalty only becomes ugly when it is fueled by greed or misplaced through blindness. To me, it is the mortar of family and friendship.

@_joshrife @TheKennyJohnson @ShawnRyanTV @OriginalFunko Agreed! @OriginalFunko needs to do a Ronnie to complete the #StrikeTeam set!

@JNettieB Still not able to return but their house is apparently still okay. 🤞
@WEEI Kellerman exposes his bias here and frankly makes a fool of himself. Inconsequential game leading up to a bye week in a division that's just not competitive makes for games like this one against Tennessee. A drubbing always motivates Brady not to mention haters like Max the mouth
I'm blessed to have played one of @TheRealStanLee 's classic characters and to have known the man. My family and I send love and condolences to Stan's family and friends and we intend to celebrate his life and legacy. #RIPStanLee Excelsior!
Bwahahahhahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaa! Thank you! Can’t wait for TB12 to see this! https://t.co/mtgUs9K8MA
@JNettieB It’s well north of us but our friends still can’t go home. 🤞🏻
The Chiklis family want to add our voices to the chorus of thanks and praise for our brave service men and women this #VeteransDay2018 Thank you all!

@Bardswan @ABC7 @KTLA @cbs2kcal9brk @VCscanner Thank you!
@RachaelHPugh @ABC7 @KTLA @cbs2kcal9brk @VCscanner Thanks for this!
This isn't a suggestion. I'm actually asking for specific information regarding the status of evacuated neighborhoods. People need to know. My friends don't know what's happened to their neighborhood and there's zero information! The Oaks? @ABC7 @KTLA @cbs2kcal9brk #Woolseyfires
Could the LA local news affiliates please give more specific information as to the current status of evacuated areas? Our friends who are staying with us are frantic to know about their neighborhood and information isn't available. Any word about The Oaks in particular?
Our friends had to evacuate today and since they’re staying with us, I figured I’d make some comfort food. Chicken cacciatore a la Chikie! #calabasas #lafires stay safe. 🙏🏻 https://t.co/SkePwtiZio
When the internet came to being I thought, "Fantastic! We've entered the Information Age! The world will become smaller now. We'll be less afraid of each other. People will be better educated &amp; thus less ignorant &amp; bigoted." How naive I was. Welcome to the #MisinformationAge 😞
@andyludwig Hahahaha!
@jimmyjam_nh Spot on Jim!
@getyrtrouserson Yes I'm afraid you're absolutely correct. The ramifications of war are generational, far reaching and tragic.
It's a horrific and confounding pattern that so many of these disturbed people decide to make their last living act an attack on innocents before turning the gun on themselves. Why? Why kill a bunch of strangers before killing yourself? If you're having these thoughts, seek help!
We have a heavily armed public, plagued with an epidemic of mental health issues. A lethal combination. What are we going to do about it? We can't continue on this way. Something has to change. It's just getting worse. Human time bombs all around us. How do we defuse them?

@theChosen__One Ah then I should have added cynical and jaded to the list perhaps? Hearing this from a teacher is extremely disheartening. What’s your point? People should stay home? As a teacher, would you really encourage people to not participate in these elections?
@theChosen__One 1. America IS a democracy and it is NOT an illusion. (That’s helplessness &amp; ignorance) 2. I’m perfectly aware of the electoral college &amp; if you understood it, you would also understand why I’m encouraging people to vote! Are you advocating apathy?
@theChosen__One Really? Do tell...
Over 71 million people DID NOT vote in the last presidential election! 71 MILLION!!! Far more votes than either candidate actually received! You know who you are. Please DO NOT let apathy, helplessness or ignorance be the death of democracy!  #VOTE 🗳

This @RedSox team is so special. Phenomenal chemistry! A bunch of pros who grind every pitch and love doing it! I don’t think any team ever scored more runs with 2 outs in the post season than these #relentlessredsox #worldserieschampions watching them has been a pleasure! 🙏🏻
#workdserieschamps @RedSox https://t.co/uA7dPENrvK
@welliver_titus @1kitt73 Back in the day! Go Bosox!
If you find yourself bitching about how tired you are from watching the game last night, think about how these athletes feel! @RedSox #DoDamge
@MrMank Apologies. It’s been a rough week. A lot of people suggesting his brand of law enforcement is the way to go and I just have to nip that right in the bud. Thanks for your kind words 🙏🏻
@MrMank I’m not Vic Mackey. He’s a fictional character. His beliefs do not represent mine. If you think of him as a hero, you didn’t get it.
Please everyone, let’s move to the middle. It’s bad for ratings but it’s reasonable, rational, calm and safe. If you start to respond to this with anger and hate, stop and think about that. This is a time for maturity and thoughtful discourse not more of the same hateful vitriol.
You can’t fight a fire by throwing gasoline on it. People may scoff but I truly believe love and kindness are far more effective antidotes to hate than matching rage with more rage. An eye for an eye leaves us both blind. #Love #kindness #education
More hate. More carnage. More death. We can no longer afford to be reactive. We need to be proactive, preventative and preemptive. Thoughts and prayers are cold comfort to grieving families. The fish rots from the head. #VOTE
The Dodgers won an epic battle last night. There’s a reason they’re my national league team. They are formidable but they will not win this war! Go @RedSox #DoDamge #WorldSeries
Oh and Nathan Eovaldi is a superhero. Night.
After all that, it’s 2 - 1 @RedSox #dodamage

@allenMarples I'm not asking anyone for money. I'm asking people to consider supporting a fellow artist. I get nothing out of it, save the satisfaction of helping my friend. I contributed myself &amp; spread the word. If you can't help, that's fine. Those that can, please do! It's pretty simple.
Come on people, he's 4 K short of a green light! Like my dad says, "a lot of hands make light work." 5 - 10 bucks and you're helping an artist tell you all his story. Pass on that latte and pitch in! https://t.co/PwIaw9NgQK https://t.co/kprNFutogi
@flbound07 10 bucks and you're helping an artist make a film.
Pass this around. They’re very close now! Too close to quit!

Gee wiz gang, anyone catch the score tonight? @richeisen you must know? @RedSox @Yankees #shellacked
@MattyBruins @RedSox We knew that game two was the game we wanted to slip by and the most likely we would drop because of Price. We will clip one of two in NY and win it all at home!
Right move by Cora. He really knows how to manage a game.   Now we need some help from our offense. @RedSox

@coachiggs https://t.co/f4HL6xjxCw
@RobertBeatty55 On the contrary. I’m concerned about just that.
@coachiggs Instead of insulting my intelligence, indicting my integrity and assuming you know anything about me or my knowledge base. Why not listen, think and discuss? I know it’s easier to just name call but what might amaze you is what you might learn.
@JohnDennisWEEI Human nature is never a maybe John. It’s the one completely dependable constant of our kind. All the “measurable” economic data in the world isn’t nearly as reliable as man’s capacity for greed &amp; conversely, fear. Personally, I’ll ride both waves as they ebb &amp; flow. Good luck 🍀
@JBorzumato Well it might hearten you to know that, if I had to label myself, it would be as a Kennedy dem. Moderate reasonable, rational centrist. Boring I know but I believe in moderation for a happy life.
@JBorzumato Regulation is not tax and I could use a tax break myself. I’m not a socialist though we live in a hybrid of capitalism and socialism right now. These issues and complex and nuanced but now everyone just wants to fight, over simplify and reduce everything to black and white.
@JBorzumato You presume a lot in this tweet. Especially the part about rooting for a downturn. It’s a warning. Stop labeling people you don’t know and listen. I’m a student of history and human behavior. I want this country to flourish.
@JohnDennisWEEI Deregulation. I wish it were okay but I study human behavior for a living and greed will ruin it. You need rules John. It moderates the level and speed of success but prevents rampant abuse. History teaches us this but greed forces us to ignore it.

@youngcryptopope If you bring a bunch of wolves into a chicken coop and say, “now you be nice and don’t eat all the chickens.” And then just leave. When you come back you will find nothing left but a pile of feathers.
@youngcryptopope The folks on board were sipping champagne 🍾 and enjoying a luxurious, smooth ride for quite a while before they hit. Here’s another analogy that might make it clear. I’m a capitalist and I wish there were no thieves in this world but unfortunately there are so here goes...
@youngcryptopope Clearly you don’t understand what you just read.
People fail to recognize the US economy is like the Titanic, huge, powerful and seemingly unsinkable but it takes a long time to steer away from obstacles. This “Captain” has hit the throttle &amp; now we’re cruising at full speed as he turns us back towards the ice. https://t.co/uePKm6CNag

@MarinaProctor @sagaftra @ActorsEquity @directorsguild This is so spot on I could frame it!!!
@BubbersThe @sagaftra @ActorsEquity @directorsguild Actually I'm sure he would want a spotlight shined on this issue because maybe it will lead to more equitable union contracts for working-class actors so they can make a living wage &amp; not have to work 1, 2 or even 3 other jobs to make ends meet. That's how progress works.
There are so many ridiculous misconceptions about actors I could write a book about it! A tip of the hat this #LaborDay to honor all #ActorsWithDayJobs. Hold your head high Geoffrey!

@ZanderMagic Also, any individual or group who deliberately spread lies and misinformation in order to create chaos and incite violence.
@ZanderMagic Very simple &amp; extremely limited. I'm intolerant of any person or group of persons who's stated intent/belief is, if they were to have their way, another person or group of people would be enslaved/opressed/exterminated. Example: I believe Nazism should be outlawed in the USA.
@ZanderMagic Nope, can't agree with this thinking. It's called the paradox of intolerance John. I give these people no quarter. This isn't merely a disagreement. These people are dangerous. No quarter!
@CatherinVaritek Don't bother, it's really upsetting fringe wacko conspiracy theory shit that should have 43 followers from some backwater not 430K. It's indicative of a failure on the part of the educational systems of the USA over the last 30 years. The ignorant need to be educated.
@Songsmithdh1 That's a very large flock of lost, stupid sheep!
Infowars still has over 430K followers for Christ sake! Who are these f-ing idiots?
@boxermommyreads So glad you enjoyed it Barb!

Devastated to hear of Craig Zadan's sudden passing. He was a true gentleman and a thoughtful, sensitive and tremendously talented producer. My heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues. Rest in peace Craig.

@Rodney4KBluRay @idriselba I'm turning 55 this month and I'm getting into the best shape of my life. He can do it.
@Rodney4KBluRay @idriselba 45!? So what? Sign him up for a 3 picture deal to be shot over the next 9 years, then he passes the torch to the coolest chick alive in 2028. #justathought #JamesBond #JamieBond
@elihuh2001 @idriselba Funny you should ask... as a matter of fact, I do. But I'm more of a Bond villain. #hinthint
@elihuh2001 @idriselba Well naturally but that doesn't mean a Brit would have to play him. Probably for the best but not a must.
The only prerequisite for playing "James Bond" is being the coolest mother f...er So... @idriselba ✔️ #NOBRAINER
Sometimes it’s so difficult to stay positive on social media. So many toxic people doing harm to others and being rewarded for the worst behavior. Is it any wonder why young people are giving in to the darker aspects of their nature. They’re getting attention for it! Paid even!😩

@RayBronson5 @NYStevenFL @RedSox @Yankees That's what I just said. For a hundred years they dominated the sport and the spending. Actually that's gradually changed over the last 15-20 years and thus they remain extremely competitive but no longer dominant.
https://t.co/SCnLwvJqkw
@RayBronson5 @NYStevenFL @RedSox @Yankees Not to mention the fact that they out spent every team in baseball 3 to 1 for 100 years! Now that there's more parody things have changed quite a bit!

@cheesehead1976 Chick Michaels was one suggestion as I recall! Almost used it as a writer pseudonym.
True story: When I starred in my first film 30 years ago I was advised to change my name because it was "too ethnic." Sandy haired, blue eyed Chiklis was too ethnic. I refused. We've come a long way since then. Let's not go back.
Happy 26th anniversary @Michellechiklis Time flies when you’re having fun! https://t.co/4lMkF7lFM8
3/ Were we less sophisticated than kids today? Absolutely. Were we happier? Is this part of why we see so much anger and mental illness now? Do we all suffer from a level of PTSD? I’m asking. We all know how toxic cyberspace can be. So what can we do about it? Thoughts?
2/ ...we wake up and are immediately bombarded with the news of the entire world. Who died, who killed, who cheated, who lied, who stole, who suffered, who flourished...etc. When I was a kid, my peers and I were blissfully unaware of all of this...
1/ Social media is such a fascinating step in the evolution of human kind. It's so new relative to civilization it's rather incredible watching how we handle this deluge of information/misinformation. We're really not built to take all of this in. Think about it. Every day now...

@MoleskiA @KyleKashuv @Davidp070 But he doesn't learn not to bully by being bullied. There's no need to abandon the high ground when you're right. He deleted his comments that prompted this thread. All of these kids are traumatized &amp; we adults should fix this but if we don't it's pretty clear that they will.
@Davidp070 @KyleKashuv Please do not attack the victim of a school shooting in my defense. It's wrong &amp; accomplishes nothing. The kid has been through a lot &amp; is entitled to his feelings &amp; opinions. Everyone needs to calm down &amp; discuss this issue rationally. Name calling &amp; vitriol solves nothing.
@KyleKashuv Kyle passions are high right now. All the more reason for calm, respectful dialogue. I’m not a political person but I am a concerned parent and citizen. (And gun owner incidentally) I wish you peace, prosperity and safety. Hopefully we can all work toward that common goal.

@HoldEmCaufield We've tried that theory &amp; it hasn't worked. There's clearly a mental health issue at the root which only exacerbates the need for deterrents, which definitely work. We can't allow easy access to these WMD. The only thing the gun is blamed for is the ease of mass killing.
@usafss74 Ah okay cool... cause @davewecklmusic has flawless technique and feel as well as tremendous creativity. Cheers!

@BigBaldRon @JonPollinger Everyone acknowledges the need to address mental health issues as the root cause but you blithely ignore the FACT that the "loud thing" that "tool"is a WMD designed specifically to kill people en masse. It's too easy for a sick person to get one. Your lack of empathy is stunning.
@Andres_Got_Me @EmilioRiveraFan @TheShieldFX @BHGirlMaria @TheKennyJohnson @EmilioRivera48 @drsnell @sutterink @CatherineDent @BMartinez @CCHPounder @JayKarnes @WaltGoggins Walton isn't on twitter.
@WesBreault @denisohare Just trying to get through to the intransigent any way I can because doing nothing isn't an option.
@cc19348 Obviously Carolyn but you miss the point. When there is a massive public safety issue of any sort, steps need to be taken to mitigate risk &amp; damage. Please open your mind to the big picture here. Don't fight it, fix it.
@cc19348 I thank you for the compliment. Making the country safer is all I'm interested in here. Law abiding citizens are suffering every day at the hands of shooters. You can't walk on a plane with a gun right? Taking my shoes off every time I fly is a pain in the ass too but we have to.
@BigBaldRon @CraigHaasis You're simply incorrect sir. I can't help but wonder if you have children. I ask again, why in the world wouldn't you be open to making gun ownership safer? Statistically deterrents work. That's just another pesky fact. Are you interested in solutions or obstinate intransigence?
@PaulMalkin Couldn't agree more. I hurt for my country right now because we're having an identity crisis. We have to ask ourselves who we are and what we stand for. This is an epidemic and to continue to do nothing is criminal and immoral.
@PaulMalkin Just trying to move the needle. The intransigence is infuriating. I place the value of life over any material thing let alone guns but many people are fixated with the principal of maintaining their constitutional rights. I'm merely proposing compromise. To do nothing is insane.
@BigBaldRon @CraigHaasis 1st an AR-15 IS an assault riffle sir. Just because there are other preferred weapons used by the military does not make that untrue. 2nd Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher produced the first successful design for a semi-automatic rifle in 1885. 3rd true, so what? Facts matter.
@cc19348 I'm sorry Carolyn but your argument just doesn't hold water. I'm a gun owner &amp; was raised with guns too but to say that nothing can be done to make gun ownership safer just isn't true. Re drunk driving? Nothing is full proof but deterrence work. Look at the statistics.
@csmatteson Honestly nothing about this is funny. You asked me what I suggest and I made a few. What do you suggest?
@csmatteson You presuppose that gun control advocates do not recognize that danger too. Did you complain when smoking was banned from public places because it posed an unacceptable public health risk? You can still buy a pack of smokes right? This sort of intransigents is the problem.
@csmatteson Semantics. Craig please work with me here. Are you suggesting that we do nothing? I'm coming at this from a reasonable, rational solution based mind set. It's not either or. There's nuance to these questions. Please agree that many steps could be taken to make gun ownership safer
@BigBaldRon @CraigHaasis Not a "gun grabber" sir. Assault rifles didn't exist when the constitution was written either.  as·sault ri·fle noun a rapid-fire, magazine-fed automatic/semi-automatic rifle designed for infantry use.  Why wouldn't you be open to making gun ownership safer?
@csmatteson Part of our constitutional right is life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness. Moving about freely is a right. There were no cars when the constitution was written nor were there assault rifles. I promise you the founders would see the wisdom in adding caveats to the 2nd amendment
@CraigHaasis Life long gun owner myself. Like my analogy re cars. We've used technical advancements to make cars safer not ban all cars. We changed the cars &amp; the easy access to them. If you're blind, you can't drive. If you get drunk, you can't drive. Heavy prescription drugs, can't drive...
@csmatteson Thank you for bringing up cars. Read my last tweet. Your argument is an old one that no longer holds water. Yes there needs to be a focus on mental health as well but there's much that we can do to make gun ownership safer and more sensible. It's called technological advancement.
Look, in the 70's there were a lot of road fatalities in the US. What did we do? We made cars safer and we made stricter drunk driving and speed laws. We didn't ban all cars! We made changes that saved a lot of lives! Isn't that reasonable?
@csmatteson Your response is to protect guns after all the carnage we've seen? BTW an AR-15 IS an assault rifle. It's designed to be a people killer. But the one model isn't the point is it? I grew up a hunter &amp; gun owner. No one wants to take that away. Just make gun ownership safer...
@csmatteson Start by making reasonable gun laws &amp; restrictions. No cop wants any citizen to have an AR-15 w a high capacity clip! Also make getting a conventional gun at least as difficult as getting a f-ing drivers license! Provide outreach programs for troubled youth at all schools &amp; more.
So far as a country we have done nothing about this scourge. This is a crisis that reflects the priorities of this nation. Who are we? What are we going to do about this? Nothing? Really? How do we pretend to hold any moral high ground? Insure domestic tranquility! Do something!
Know how to "insure domestic TRANQUILITY?"  Stop selling WMD to your citizens! Nothing tranquil about an AR-15. BTW every hunter I know agrees with me &amp; none of them mind having tougher regs to get their guns. It's not about the 2nd Amendment, this is about protecting our kids. https://t.co/q7EDbCFOIa

@realDonaldTrump What a vague &amp; weak statement @realDonaldTrump Denounce Nazis &amp; the KKK immediately in the strongest terms or admit you advocate for them.
@scottlud Cooler heads must prevail
@scottlud Nazis = cancer &amp; you can't coexist with cancer, you have to cut it out or destroy it where it lives.
Never imagined so many would defend Neo-Nazis in the US. 65 million people died including 400 K + Americans in WWII. How did we get here!?
@Diane_7A @mikecakeman I'd laugh but I honestly never thought having zero tolerance for Nazis would be controversial 😳
@mikecakeman @Diane_7A Wait...so you're defending the Nazis?

@danturnerjr Once again, you know nothing about me Jr. Interesting how you rag on me and Hollywood but you put your trust in a reality tv hack grifter.
@danturnerjr What's your business? How's it been going over the last decade? How old are you? Where did you go to school? Seriously curious now.
@danturnerjr Crediting a president of 6 months with job growth reveals you know nothing about economics. Curious about your idiocy. What happened Jr?
@danturnerjr More evidence of your arrogance and ignorance. You know nothing about me. Tell me about yourself Jr. What do you do? Are you married? Kids?
@danturnerjr Oh my... I just looked at your feed. Never mind. There's no cure for the kind of stupidity you suffer from. I am out of touch...with you. ✌️
@danturnerjr Since I grew up in a middle-class family from the suburbs of Boston (not elitist at all) tell me Jr. what exactly is a "Hollywood elite?"
@danturnerjr Look man, you've been duped by Don The Con. A lot of people have been. Wake up, be an American 1st &amp; stop defending these frauds. 2/2
@danturnerjr He had to Jr. His veto would have been overturned. Do you read? Re Hillary; another false equivalency but don't assume you know my views.1/2

I said Belgium because of that. Meaning, how long till it all breaks up? This is just the beginning. Very troubling... @JBrsted
