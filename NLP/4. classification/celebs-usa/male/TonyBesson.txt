@MKBHD just passed 80k miles on my 2015 85D. not a single issue, yet. can’t imagine ever switching back to gas for any reason other than if I picked up a classic car again as a second ride. https://t.co/m9NMcZwUzI

@seancannell heading out to the show today!
@ClintKeepin @RomainHedouin @Tesla @elonmusk I had a Subaru STI and ‘69 Bronco before. The STI was actually more a month likely because the average owner is less than 22yrs old.  My Bronco’s insurance was practically free because it falls under classic insurance pricing.
@Crawl_SC @elonmusk @Tesla Haven’t had to, yet. Just got them checked.
@kelly4webb @Crawl_SC @elonmusk @Tesla yup! My brakes are still good, as well.
@RomainHedouin @ClintKeepin @Tesla @elonmusk My first set lasted to 42k miles and I drive it pretty aggressively. Purchased some high performance tires that only lasted 5k miles before switching back to factory tires.
@aaronbesson @elonmusk @Tesla https://t.co/t79ul5AiUg

@wendito03 week ago!
@IgorHowA I was wondering that when I was editing it, too. I don’t know what it is.
@CaseyNeistat best view! 🤙🏻 https://t.co/COWa89u4GJ
@elonmusk First off, so stoked you made time for this. Very cool! Question: is Track Mode only going to be available on the Model 3’s.  Translation: are us Model S (dual motor) owners gonna be able to get wild with our S’s in the future?   *please say yes. please say yes!*
@CaseyNeistat: use the @NTRecovery system I sent you. Should solve that pain in your knee issue in no time.

@Gur814 @MKBHD @elonmusk ha! yeah. I doubled for Hayden Christensen most of the movie.
@Gur814 @MKBHD @elonmusk just caught that, as well. mines likely long expired, too. I’ve had my S since 2015.... getting ansy for some more power and that new car smell. can’t imagine ever owning any other car, now.
@Gur814 @MKBHD i’m currently a model S owner. assuming I can’t refer myself, I would hope to just be grand-fathered into it. i understand not including it with the base model 3’s. wish the performance models came with it given the higher price point. any chance that ever happens, @elonmusk?
@MKBHD feel like we’re a few years out still from a 2nd Gen Model S. been kicking around the idea of swooping up one of these to replace my 85d. hate the idea of giving up free charging, though. that Track Mode looks dope AF. solid video, dude.

@TheRock @linkinpark I've nerded out twice in my life meeting anybody. The first was Chester years back at the VMA's. The other, well, you. Such a loss.
@TedStryker @daxholt Fucking terrible news.
Completely gutted to hear about Chester. I've seen maybe 20 shows in my life &amp; more than 1/2 of them were Linkin Park. Damn, brother. Why?!
@BBCNorthAmerica If this doesn't tug on your ❤️ strings and inspire the hell out of you I don't know what will.

@ha_gaaabe @CaseyNeistat @HulkHogan One would assume, yes. But, that's the weird part. We actually met on the set of 'Eli Stone' and he/they started following me the next day.

Have you read your tweets?! RT @mariateresaroj6: @TonyBesson please follow me, why no?
I'd prefer not to, but thanks for the opportunity. RT @mariateresaroj6: @TonyBesson follow me?
Lol RT @JennyJohnsonHi5: Stay in school, kids. RT @TaraReid: Yo you guys is it really supposed to be the end of the world tonight?
@RyanTuerck Sounds good, hit me up when you get out here. We'll go throw some mud around in the Bronco, she's rockin' a new 351W now.
@RyanTuerck North of 400K views on episode 1 (http://t.co/YJ823ZL7 …), huh buddy?! #AWSM Keep throwin' those vids down! You out here soon?
Real sorry to hear that, @DaneCook. You're literally the 3rd person I know who I'v read today about their dog passing, yesterday. So sad.

Everybody does 'Ugly Sweater' Christmas parties, I prefer '1sies Pajama' parties, instead. Booze tastes better in PJ's. http://t.co/VJIhkpDE
Thanks, @LifeProof. Really looking forward to you guys releasing the new armband for the iPhone 5 case.
I just spent $21.90 at Wendy's. On just myself. Not gonna lie; I'm equally as disappointed with myself as I am impressed.
Christmas lights are looking solid, @NikkiSixx!
@AlonzoinLA thanks, brother.
I'll be more impressed when it's 13/13/13.
I hate people who bitc% about the iPhone when they don't even have one. It's like a virgin telling you sex is overrated.
BIG thanks to @SpartanRace for not only having me out for their Malibu event, but for also including me in this vid =&gt; http://t.co/iQfEKuqX!
Don't mind me, just over here geeking out over the new 'Man of Steel' trailer. http://t.co/4YGWYW22

We're losing by 4pts, you win. RT @pennydrake4real: @TonyBesson I'm in São Paulo, Brazil. Yeah. Kinda having a good day off. Lol.
Feels weird rollin' thru Staples Center &amp; not being able to say "Hi" to, @pennydrake4real. Hope you're having fun on your day off, kiddo.
Roughly 11,460 days ago today, @DebbieBesson &amp; @MichaelBesson had unprotected sex. Today, we celebrate that random act of irresponsibility.
Well, I'v got that going for me! :) thanks, Esk. RT @DanielleCasting: @TonyBesson Happy Birthday lovah!!! You are a stud!
“@teeco71: Happy Birthday to @TonyBesson please make sure to give him a #follow &amp; send some B'day wishes his way :)” tell em, Tommy!
Thanks, Jana. RT “@JanaKris: @TonyBesson Happy Birthday, Tony!!! Wish you a wonderful one! Hope all is well. :) xx”

BIG thanks to @CarrieRADams &amp; the entire @spartanrace organization for having me out @ today's event in Malibu, I had an absolute blast!
Thanks, @mikeBnelson. BTW- congrats on the booking! Have fun out in Vegas, that's my hometown.
This week was insane! My agent is killing it. 8 auditions, 3 of which were callbacks. Just a matter of time before this kid is back on TV.
True story. RT @CarrieRADams: @SpartanRace you know @TonyBesson is originally from #Nebraska, right? My home state!
Pretty sure 'the nothing' from "The Neverending Story" is making its way over the S bound 405 right now. Call, Atreyu. http://t.co/c3vC4NWd
BREAKING NEWS: Lindsay Lohan arrested in NYC for, well acting like Lindsay Lohan. In other useless news- I prefer sushi over steak.
Hey, @DanielleCasting. It's been far too long since our last make out sesh, this is unacceptable! #haveYourPeopleCallMyPeople
Been stuck @ a callback 4 over an hr. In other non-entertaining news, I'm eating an apple &amp; reflecting back that I should have gone orange.
I don't know @JennyJohnsonHi5, personally. But from what I'v heard the past few days about her, she's good people.

Solid night of drinking &amp; memorising with good friends &amp; fam. Finishing up the night w/ shots of Tequila &amp; 'Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles'.
@PortableShua Solid action flick, brother! All sorts of crazy that last 10mins. #RedDawn #Wolverines
Black Friday: because only in America do people trample each other for sales exactly 1 day after being thankful for what they already have.

@OoooItsMe We're going camping this weekend, or should I say, "glamping". I was sold after hearing the tents have wi-fi &amp; climate control.
You could have mentioned this last night, @davidsullivan9.
Why @JasonBiggs spends 1/2 his day responding only 2 followers that do nothing but talk shit about him is beyond me, but it is entertaining!
Bumped into @Tyrese today at Kinkos. Dude must be 'How I Met Your Mother' fan because he was suited up like, Barney Stinson.
@OoooItsMe's Malibu Marathon run has got some AWSM, eye candy. She's running &amp; I'm sippin' a pumpin latte &amp; tweeting.  http://t.co/TkpIcO02

@ooooitsme You. Me. 'Skyfall' tonight at, @Muvico14. #PantiesOptional
I would like to thank, @OttoEspresso1, for my now 8-12 shots a day addiction to espresso. You created this machine. It's your fault.
Why four shots of espresso at 7:30pm?! Because a 3hr training sesh at @TempestAcademy begins in 3, 2, 1....... #BeastMode
This movie (http://t.co/PRt40ZGR … …) actually looks pretty dam, good. #WorldWarZ
I only drink on 2 occasions: When I'm thirsty &amp; when I'm not.

Just finished eating my 1st Big Mac in over 10 yrs, immediately remembered why I hadn't had a Big Mac in over 10 yrs.
Pretty stoked that the election is over, now I can get back to reading about check-in's &amp; seeing Instagram pix of your dogs or lunch.
#1 reason I voted for Obama: I knew it would piss my father off.
Went into class with a black president, came out of class with the same black president. All is well in the universe.
Tonight is the night we find out if it's true...  America went black...  will it go back?
I early voted this year, but only because it seemed chic. And it's true, because every time I tell someone I early voted, they love it.
#Thatawkwardmoment just after U've checked ur FB, Instagram &amp; Twitter when U realize there's nothing left 2do but TALK 2 ur friend @ lunch.
I don't wanna sound like a badass or anything, but I just saved a starving child by "Liking" a picture on Facebook.
If you're are looking to kill 3hrs while getting visually mind banged, check out 'Cloud Atlas' ----- or you could just drop acid.
I'v never tasted my dogs asshol*, but I would imagine it tastes similar to @AMCTheatres espresso.
I'v got a few extra @MoviePass invites I'm giving away. Shoot me a tweet w/ your email address if U want 1. 1st 3 peeps to respond get em!
"You're Tony Besson, huh? Indeed I am. "I follow you on Twitter, you're funny sometimes!" Uhhh, thanks?! -random chick at Whole Foods.

For the record, I had to Google how to spell cunnilingus. Saddens both my girlfriend &amp; I.
With that being said: Reese Witherspoon is another story.
Now that I'v been next to Cameron Diaz for longer then 10mins I can honestly say I'd rather engage in cunnilingus w/ my girlfriend.
@Clampaid the world's ending in 55 days?! Shit. I better catch up on my @TiVo then. #pressesPlayOnSeason4ofBreakingBad

For me, there really isn't a single problem in life that can't be remedied by either a triple shot of espresso or tequila. #RealTalk
Diggin' the Facebook 5.0 app update. That was what, 2 years overdue?!
I'v spent the last 9hrs of my life watching nothing but back 2 back episodes of, "Breaking Bad". That's right, I know how to party!
The first 5 days after the weekend are always the hardest.
Truly saddened to hear about "Top Gun" Director Tony Scott's apparent suicide earlier today, Hollywood lost a VERY talented man today! #RIP
We're conquering that wall at @tempestacademy on Tuesday night, @CBDon_CA!

Having one of those days that I think only @danecook could relate too.
Riveting film, there's already Oscar buzz. RT @Kevzin Off to the gym then back home to watch @TonyBesson in 100 Ghost Street.
Cloud porn. http://t.co/aW6SKvpK
I'm not in this business to become rich &amp; famous [LIES], I just don't want to ever have to take off my hat at any restaurant or club. EVER.
Let me know how it is! RT @karliethebarbie Watching 100 Ghost Street: The Return of Richard Speck, @Jasmininaaa where you at?!
#SpoilerAlert, I die in it. RT @_LeahTrann 100 Ghost Street is the scariest movie ever! Started watching it &amp; I'm already scared..
There's NO WAY you're going marlin fishing in Hawaii w/out a GoPro,@TKFrench. So, I loaded U up an AWSM box of @GoPro toys &amp;overnighted it!
You ready for Vegas, @VaughnGittinJr?!
I gained about fifty new followers last night, this puts me only 26,531,843 away from being just 10,000 short of @JustinBieber!
Sharks must HATE Aug.12-19th every year.
I know XGames athletes who in their careers haven't gotten hurt as much as my friend, @followMikeLove. Broken neck &amp; back in the same year?!

My kinda Thursday night.  http://t.co/c9kh0r6L
@cassandrasteele you've got some interesting, fans! For example, @DemetreBryonhu3. He's been on a hot 1 ever since you tweeted me yesterday.
Waxed eyebrows are the new toupee.
Absolutely, pointless tweet.
I may have lost my virginity to that song, I also might not have. RT “@pennydrake4real: Journey's "Don't Stop Believin" never. gets. old. ”
Operation "Become 1'ce a month drinking buddies w/ @JasonBiggs &amp; @jennyandteets" needs help, start sending dirty pix to Biggs, @OoooItsMe!
Excellent question, @chandralikesfun. Highly unlikely that @jennyandteets didn't see the posts. Call it a failure. Not my first.

I was told by 3 friends over the weekend that I look like I'v gained a lot of weight. In other news: I killed 3 people this past weekend.
I bet black unicorns have the biggest horns.
I'm willing to bet jumping thru a window in real life is a lot more painful then they make it appear to be in movies.

It's almost impossible to watch the Olympics &amp; not become a fan of, @gabrielledoug. HUGE congrats on bringing home the Gold!!!
I chose, Olympics. http://t.co/QBSvlp93
@OoooItsMe's texting me dirty pix, she wants me to come satisfy some #50ShadesOfGrey fantasy of hers. I'm torn between that or the Olympics.
Just got done watching "The Dark Knight Rises" for the 2nd time. It's no "100 Ghost Street: The Return of Richard Speck", but it's decent.
I'v been called worse. Matter of fact, probably even by you. RT “@ashleebond: @OoooItsMe @tonybesson u guys are gross, lol”
@JennTolman your "Hero" is Alicia Silverstone?! I might have to sign with another (grabs phone to call Gersh) agency.
I couldn't be friends with a person who drinks de-caffeinated coffee.
I'm in a movie that's now out called "100 Ghost Street: The Return of Richard Speck". You'll see nudity. You'll get scared. Now go see it.
How has there not been a single person who has made a Katherine Jackson parody Twitter account yet, the material practically writes itself.
I'v been looking for an opportunity to use that last hash tag. (checks 1 item off bucket list)

@Most_Designs what's wrong is the fact that I bought 4 scoops &amp; polished it off within 10mins of the first bite. #melikeycookiesAndcream
Eating Baskin Robbins while watching the Olympics feels kinda wrong, but it also feels kinda AWESOME.
