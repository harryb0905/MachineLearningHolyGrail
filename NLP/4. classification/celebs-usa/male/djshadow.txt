Wacky, edgy show tonight in ATL. Thankfully I was up for the challenge, seems like the crowd was too. Thanks for rocking with me y'all
I used to consider my US fan base largely confined to the coasts. Lately tho, the best gigs have been in "secondary markets." I'm ok w that
I guess that goes to show you the power of a good promoter, a good venue, and a knowledgeable, hungry fan base. Thank you Asheville!!!
If I could bottle an audience to use in case of wack crowd emergencies, it would be the audience tonight in Asheville. F--king amazing.
Asheville wins. #themountainwillfalltour

Today was enthralling. Everybody was completely in sync w the spirit of the event, despite my fears to the contrary. It was touching to see
Here's everything you need to know about the DJ Shadow pop-up store this weekend in LA: https://t.co/esQssNwepF https://t.co/LBUrhAVS2v
@Skyaaz_com saying.
@TheAshleyBeedle @AndyHermannLA Don't worry there will be plenty of cheapies on hand!
@BenCazzola ha. Not "selling my collection..." just lazy clickbait headlines  out there misleading folks
@insomniacdotcom nope. Not selling my collection...just some duplicates...I know it's confusing
@lukeguidici exactly.
@HouseShoes Looking forward!
@oliverswang True, but in this case I'm only selling records I already have a file copy of.
@oliverswang I think that's because non-collectors automatically assume that all collectors are hoarders.
People keep texting me like "Yo, tell me it's not true!!" Everything is fine, ha ha. Just a little pop-up sale for fun. Stop in!
Regarding the pop-up store in LA this weekend: I am not "selling my record collection." Just some duplicates I have picked up thru the years
@MistahFAB what's good Fabby, dm me and let's link
@dancingastro not really...just some duplicates and other stuff I had sitting around in quantity
Los Angeles, the First Annual DJ Shadow Storage Sale is coming at you very soon: https://t.co/uQFzRfqSuD https://t.co/FJgNkUnbws

@303Squintz for sure, stay tuned...
Jeez, ridiculous line-up tonight https://t.co/vtP58v9KBZ
@LFCCapital7 my team
I hope this 2-hour mix is fully representative of my DJ aesthetic: demonstrating a love for our musical past and present in equal measure.
The second hour: a left turn (naturally). Music very dear to my heart that is heretofore unknown. Definitely one for the hip-hop fanatics.
The 1st hour is an homage to the genius I hear around me on a daily basis. New beats, new ideas. Lots of Cali stuff bc that's where I dwell.
Back to the new mix. Fun fact #2: I recorded the first half in April, right after finishing the new album. Had to get it in before tour prep
In fact a NY Times journalist recently asked if she could do a story about the phenomenon. Hopefully that'll happen soon. I'm ready 2 reveal
The slow, moody singer/songwriter track near the end of the mix is one of the most asked-about records I've ever shared in any context.
I put so much energy into it that I decided to issue it as a limited 2xCD package called "Diminishing Returns." Stickers &amp; coasters included
Ok, just a few more hours until my new @essentialmix drops on @BBCR1 . Fun fact #1: my first Essential Mix debuted over 13 years ago.
@EngineEarz yup! üëä
My @essentialmix airs this weekend.  First hour, killer new beats. Hour 2 is strictly for the collectors. üöÄ @BBCR1

Connecting a sense of place to the music I enjoy from all over the world is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a touring DJ.
I remember leaving Bulgaria, homesick &amp; tired from touring, &amp; "I Got 5 On It" was playing over the airplane speaker. I was like TAKE ME HOME
Music from the San Francisco Bay Area speaks to me in a special way...it's in my soul, a reflection of the landscape in which I was born
We all have a special affinity to music from the region and community in which we were raised. For many, it is a profound and lifelong bond.

Calgary, WE'RE HERE
@Cut_Chemist &amp; I are paying tribute to the genius of Bambaataa in our final 3 shows of the year: Edmonton 2nite, Calgary 2moro, Oakland Tues
I decided to pursue a communications degree because of a Yo!MTVRaps interview with Kool Moe Dee in 1989. I needed direction, rap provided it
Rappers like @MrChuckD , @IAmKRSOne , Rakim, &amp; even @FINALLEVEL taught me to view the world differently, with humility and maturity
I feel fortunate to have grown up in an era where there was a true variety of personalities and viewpoints within hip-hop
Yup, just arrive to the venue for soundcheck around 5:30, we got you RT"@atheg74: @djshadow are signatures a part of the VIP package?"

Been coming to Austin for 19 years. It's changed a lot, but I loved it then and I love it now
Busy week. #SXSW tonight, @beatteamsupreme event on Friday, and a surprise on Wednesday...
Before eBay, record collectors stayed in their own lanes. Rock dealers wouldn't touch soul, etc. Now everyone's an 'expert' in everything. $
I can't come to Austin without thinking about how fun it used to be to tear this town apart buying funk 45s when literally no one else was
Honored to be playing with @Machine_Drum and @reggiewatts tonight for this @VICE event! #SXSW #Austin

Thank you @fujirock_jp, amazing experience
Like the time in France when Mot√∂rhead started playing on the second stage during a particularly mellow Radiohead performance #comedic

There's some really good beats coming out of Australia right now
Shout-out to @djnobody, one of the nicest people I've ever met, for real
My Fridays are dedicated exclusively to checking out as much new music as humanly possible.
Working on a remix for a friend. I'll debut it next month at Fabric.
I lost most of my 'rock' fans after The Outsider, which is too bad, because I think some of them would have liked TLYKTB
Whether I find anything or not is almost irrelevant; it's a lifestyle and a state of mind. Plus, I've been doing it my whole life.
I consider myself well-balanced musically. For example, I still go digging on off days.
Red Rocks! Now THAT was fun.
There go that @djembadjembaa remix
The homies @TwoFreshbeats killing it at Red Rocks
And now, my attention turns to Red Rocks. #AllBassesCovered2013
Lincoln, Nebraska!  I will definitely be coming back here, my new favorite place to play.  Thanks for the GREAT time
Express Rising II.  You need it in your life, trust me.
Nebraska, I go on at almost midnight tonight, so don't worry about any time conflict w other shows in the area #AllBassesCovered2013
Getting ready 2 head to Lincoln, Nebraska. Another first made possible by the fact that I'm rolling light (no visuals or lights, just music)
People keep telling me every day that I look tired. At some point those people need to realize that this is my face
Just spent six hours on a forty second transition in my set. Not sure whether to laugh or cry
I don't care about charts, sales/views, or blogger hype. If it's good music, it's in, period. The artists I play know what I'm talking about
My formula for determining what music to DJ is the same as it was 25 years ago...I seek out the dopest beats, and I play them. End of story.
Some people have asked where the shirts I'm wearing are from...you can find them here: http://t.co/jSMdQjh77x
Got my eyes on the Warriors game &amp; my ears in this new music I'm adding 4 this weekend's shows...nothing better than holding exclusive fire
Wow, this @Thundercatbass track sounds like a HIT to me... #goodnewmusic
Shout-out to the homie @clicksxwhistles for sliding me some of his new beats!!! Bass for days
Showtime at 11 tonight El Paso #AllBassesCovered2013
Tulsa, I respect you...thanks for a great time #AllBassesCovered2013

Amazing venue, amazing crowd. I've said it a million times and I'll say it again...I love Austin. #AllBassesCovered2013
Tonight's SOLD OUT show in Austin moved bc of thunderstorm concerns...now at ACL Live at Moody Theater. BIGGER venue, so more tix released!
STOP SAMPLE SNITCHING
Fact: Madison, WI is a great city to play. And, fans that drive hours between shows just to support are the best fans there are. Thank you
Madison encore show tonight, completely new set from last time FYI...that's why it's called: #AllBassesCovered2013
Ok MKE!!! I go on at 11 tonight. Honored to be back in Brewtown. @miltownbeatdown #AllBassesCovered2013
Getting ready to drive to Milwaukee for tonight's show...and Madison, WI tomorrow #AllBassesCovered2013
Twin Cities, I'm excited to be here. I go on at 10:30pm tonight. You will not believe the ((B-A-S-S)) in this place

Santa Ana, California. TONIGHT. @The Observatory. TONIGHT. Midnight. TONIGHT. #AllBassesCovered2013

Sad to be leaving Maine, would have loved to have had some time off here...next time! Thanks for a great first show, Portland
Wow, so much fun tonight in Pittsburgh...audience was up for anything. So nice to play to an open-minded crowd! Portland, Maine tomorrow

My brain hurts...
In a hotel room in Athens, GA making tweaks to the set ahead of tonight's show at Georgia Theatre.  As always, expect the unexpected
Working hard on the set getting ready for next week's shows: Athens GA, Charlottesville VA, and Nashville TN, all first timers for me
Poland, thank you for your faith and generosity.  Had a tremendous time.  #AllBassesCovered2013
Playing in an old public swimming pool tonight in Warsaw.  Sound system is LOUD...recipe for a good night #AllBassesCovered2013
It CrANkED tonight in Poznan, Poland... #AllBassesCovered2013
I bump this @DroopE707 "N The Traffic" track, @NiteJewel sounds great in it
My first coast-to-coast US tour was with @Jeruthedamaja, April 1997.  #PersonalFirsts
The first record I ever played in Europe was Kings Of Pressure "You Know How To Reach Us (Instrumental)."  Berlin, 1993.  #PersonalFirsts
Excited for tonight, the first of 3 gigs in Poland! Gdansk was NUTS last time, so I have high expectations... #AllBassesCovered2013
Very special to get to meet everyone after the gig, THANK YOU St. Petersburg, let's do it again SOON!!
Looking forward to tonight's show in St. Petersburg at Kosmonavt Club!! I go on at 9pm
The last time I was in Russia it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit...this time it's only 15.  St. Petersburg is amazing any time of year
Frankfurt represented! Not bad for a rainy Sunday night #AllBassesCovered2013
Athens that was AWESOME, it's so much more enjoyable when the audience has an open mind...thank you, and hope to be back soon!! #gratitude
In the middle of 4 gigs in a row, Athens, Greece tonight!! #AllBassesCovered2013
Being able to travel the world doing what you love for a living is both a gift and a responsibility, neither of which I take lightly.
Thank you Antwerp, for coming out to an early Monday night show, much appreciated. #Respect
Paris and Eindhoven were DOPE, Antwerp tonight! #AllBassesCovered2013
UNREAL line-up tonight in Eindhoven: @Machine_Drum, @eprombeats, @Lunice, @HudMo (and myself)... #swagnostic
New year, new set: All Basses Covered 2013.  Europe, get ready!!
This week I'm reading 'And Party Every Day: The Casablanca Records Story' by Larry Harris
Big respect to @beatteamsupreme, destroying Low End SF with some insane beats on a Friday night #swagnostic
Have spent the first three weeks of 2013 immersed in music. For this simple yet utterly essential pleasure, I am grateful.
Great night tonight in the Bay, thank you Wintersalt Fest and the homies Latyrx for an amazing end to the year
Or maybe it was all the trap &amp; juke that preceded it...I dunno. I'll get the set up on soundcloud soon so every1 can enjoy. Happy Holidays!
Ironically it was drum and bass that broke the camel's back(!) Note to self...play more drum and bass!!!
I appreciate everyone's support. Obviously I should have never been booked there in the first place. Square peg in a round hole, etc #iDoMe
I don't care if I get kicked out of every rich kid club on the planet. I will never sacrifice my integrity as a DJ...ever #AllBassesCovered
Atlanta, I'm looking forward to playing for you tonight.
That said, tonight's set in Miami WILL proceed as planned...I go on at 3am (yes, 3am!) Atlanta tomorrow #AllBassesCovered
The challenge for any "entertainer" working on this tragic day is to find a place to compartmentalize the sorrow in order to carry on...
Thank u 2 @bassiklife 4 bringing me out 2 Nola, helluva show! Loved meeting everyone at the signing table. C u next year! #AllBassesCovered
Just wrapped up sound check at The Republic. First time I've done this type of set in Nola, EVER. The homie @Salva is playing 2nite as well
Touched down in New Orleans, my musical home-away-from-home. Playing @Republic TOMORROW, Miami Friday, Atlanta Saturday. #AllBassesCovered
Brooklyn Bowl tonight! This show sold out weeks ago, so I know it's going to be ON #AllBassesCovered
Once again I'm so honored 2 meet everyone after the show tonight in Boston, thank you 4 having fun w me and forgetting that it's a Sunday!
I love that people r "getting" what this set is all about...if ur not moving forward, ur standing still. As an artist, the choice is simple.
Here we go, Boston! I go on at 10pm tonight 'cause it's Sunday, just FYI #AllBassesCovered
DETROIT!! That's three sold out nights in a row, thank you!! Tonight was amazing...Boston up next! #AllBassesCovered

Wow Madison WI, thank you so much for all of the love during and after the set, that was truly humbling. I had a blast, hope it showed.
Tonight's show is sold out. Dope!! #AllBassesCovered
About to go on in Madison.  Need to keep my wits about me...most of tonight's set is basically unrehearsed! #AllBassesCovered
Case in point: Madison, WI tonight. Looking forward to it! #AllBassesCovered
The nice thing about doing DJ sets, as opposed to the full live show, is that I'm able to visit smaller markets I've never been to before
Getting ready to DJ live at @KCRW and http://t.co/rasSdAHM!! #AllBassesCovered
Putting in WORK getting ready for these USA shows...first up is Madison, Wisconsin this Thursday #AllBassesCovered #BackInTheSaddle

Thank you to anyone and everyone who has ever paid to support my art. I respect your trust in my craft and that's how I continue to grow
You can pay for YouTube views and twitter followers, but real fans can't be bought; they are earned.
Touched down in Santiago, Chile. I go on at 1am, in case you're making plans
Sao Paolo, my new favorite city. How has it taken this long?? I've been missing out...thanks for an amazing night, I can't wait to return
This week I'm reading Kraftwerk Publikation, a biography by David Buckley. Great backstory about Computer World, one of my all-time fav LPs
Bogota, thank you for being a wonderful host on my first trip to Columbia. I really appreciate the support.
Seems to me that South America is one of the few places left that still has a genuine intellectual curiosity about music
Always have been, and always will be, a hip-hop DJ. But I will play something different if the mood strikes me or the situation demands it
Gotta say, this @CoronaFest schedule is one of the best line-ups I've ever seen...from Shabazz Palaces to New Order. And that's just today
Upon arrival in Mexico, the customs form asked if I was bringing any "samples." For me, that's kind of a trick question
Getting ready to fly to Mexico City to begin a solid run of SA dates. Columbia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina. Life is good. #AllBassesCovered
Reconstructed: The Best of DJ Shadow is now available: http://t.co/M1xb5JHT - These are my personal favorites so far, w 2 new ones. Enjoy!

"Reconstructed: The Definitive DJ Shadow" -- Coming very soon... Stay Tuned...  http://t.co/fRypK22q

Been 6 years since I last played Sacramento, looking forward to Launch 2012 Saturday night! Set includes a world premier, among other things
The live tour is over but I have a few DJ dates coming up...it's refreshing to build a set using other people's music instead of just my own
Working on some stuff for my Low End Theory fam...it's going down this Friday in SF...
Completed a new track with the legendary Terry Reid, what an absolute HONOR...he's still got it and then some
Rest In Peace, Yauch! Condolences to the entire Beasties family.  A sad day for anyone who grew up loving hip-hop
And make sure to bring your 3D glasses!

My home-away-from-home in Seattle?  That would be The Showbox, hosting one of the final four #Shadowsphere shows tonight.  Get there by 9pm!
Have to say Vancouver, that was one of my favorites of this tour, I felt great (which helps) & awesome, vocal audience (which REALLY helps)
Oh, and the great @jojomayernerve opening up on all remaining shows as well! Vancouver tonight, then Seattle, Portland, Reno, San Francisco
After a killer @Coachella2012, down to the last 5 #Shadowsphere shows ever.  Tonight it's Vancouver, BC @CommodoreBallroom.  5 shows, 5 days
Thanks to all involved @LevitateFestival, I had a blast! Open-minded audiences are the best kind.  Next stop, @Coachella part deux
My musical tastes are always evolving, but the thing that never changes is my love for rap and hip-hop.  It will always be my 'life music'
Getting ready to head to @LevitateFest here in CO, an honor to share the stage with @ruskoofficial again!
Want to say thank you to my man @Mophono for opening up for me on the last few tour dates, very inspiring musically and such a cool dude
Aspen, CO tonight.  Hopefully the #Shadowsphere is gonna fit!
Back at The Depot in Salt Lake City for one last #Shadowsphere show...energy renewed from a great weekend at Coachella
Nobody saw it coming
OOOOOHHHHHHH YEEEAAAAHHH #Coachella2012
T minus 5 hours until liftoff. #Coachella
Live in So-Cal? Want to see the #Shadowsphere but couldn't get Coachella tix? Last chance tonight in Ventura @majestic theatre. LATE SHOW
A lot of people are saying that they're "working on something special" for @Coachella.  You can put me in that category as well.
Good stuff, @Snowbombing...smashing night of music alongside Jungle Brothers & @Zanelowe (a gentleman & scholar.) Next stop, @Coachella
This is my night. #Snowbombing #Shadowsphere
You can't win 'em all...I'd settle for one, though
Merci, Morlaix! Jusqu'√† la prochaine fois
Gearing up to unleash two pretty insane archival projects...one "official," one thru my site.  Excited about both of them for diff reasons
Bye-bye, Canada.  Hello, Switzerland.
Just finished sound check here in Toronto.  Phoenix Theater, tonight.  I go on at 10pm, make sure to catch @jojomayernerve at 8:30!
Syracuse tonight! This is NOT my first time playing here, however...will explain more at show (hint: it was 1997, and Nas was the headliner)
@EngineEarz Oh, groan...I know what it is now.  No, not me, but thanks 4 the heads-up.
@EngineEarz Wha??? Er, that's news to me! I'd like to be there, too. Can u email me the link?
@elmayhem Yes, it is.  It's not me, it's the label...a machine that doesn't feel remorse, or pity, or fear. I will try again
Ok Boston! That was a good one. Near-perfect show for a perfect crowd. Goodnight and drive safe
Thank you NYC, see you...soon???  Next up, Boston and Syracuse as the final Shadowsphere dates roll on
Heading down to @IrvingPlaza for tonight's show in NYC. Nov 2010 show there was one of my favorites, so high expectations for tonight
Great crowd tonight in MD, generous with the love (and forgiving of my nervousness.) Thank you one and all
Wow, @jojomayernerve set tonight = amazing.
@estif_panamanan Thank you, brotha.
@FrannieWTF @djshadow You should make London, UK your home away from home. &lt;--- It already is, forever and a day, til the end.
@makev_ @djshadow Last year at Rams Head was awesome, anyone opening for you tonight?? &lt;---- Yes, @jojomayernerve, they go on @8pm
Home away from home: playing The Fillmore tonight in Silver Spring, MD. First and last DC area Shadowsphere show, let's do it
Very nice to build (briefly) w @AlanTheChemist and @DJ_Muggs just before the show @Ultra. Humbling to play in the presence of my peers.
@dclang @ultramusic Nice. Had a blast.
@owbmusic @ultramusic I appreciate that, thanks.
@StevieReds Costa Rica!
Wasn't sure what to expect, but I actually had a really good time playing @Ultra Music Festival in Miami. 1st 2012 show, felt great
Have never, ever, ever played Miami before.  Ever.  But that all ends on March 24th.
@EllenMclean Would love to come back to Belfast, believe me...great town. But tour ends soon
Damn...@eprombeats got that sick knock
@SLUGABEDmusic Cheers for that bro
@UndeRadar Can't say that I blame you...
@Kdope50 Good to hear. DM me your cell fam
@TheMode101 @coachella Unfortunately not, too chaotic to try at festivals.  Too many restrictions  Thx
@Kdope50 Nuthin, same old...good to hear from you! I'm coming to NYC in about a month.  How you been?
Going to one of the upcoming shows? Enter to win a PRIVATE TOUR inside the #Shadowsphere before it disappears forever: http://t.co/F4sALlcZ
The armies are massing at the border...
I go to these music tech conferences and all I see are Wall Street dudes running around trying to play moneyball with DJ culture.
Congratulations and respect to my good friend Jim Abbiss for his win tonight! Nice to see real talent recognized at last
Always so much fun playing 45s @Danny's in Chicago...no pretension, just really good music and a regular monthly crowd of music lovers
DAT tape was without a doubt the most fragile, unstable storage medium ever invented. Trying to salvage old masters is like defusing a bomb
Yesterday: drive is dead, files lost. This morning: after repeated tries, drive miraculously works again, files saved. Happiness restored.
Top 5 Winning ‚ÄúScale It Back‚Äù Fan Remixes Available Now for Free Download http://t.co/GO6BhMGI  -- #ScaleItBack
REMIX CONTEST WINNERS ANNOUNCED: http://t.co/yLKzQu9O #ScaleItBack
There's about 8 or 9 that I love as much as anything I've heard in the last 12 months. Such an amazing result
Narrowing 400 remix entries down to 40 isn't too hard.  Getting to 20 isn't bad, either.  But after that, it gets reeeaaal dicey
Real bad boys move in silence
On a global basis, I'm hoping for a lot more (good) music and a lot less economic and political tyranny in 2012
Christmas vacation always seems a little too long for me...celebrated NYE by staying home and WORKING.  Gotta get these ideas down
Records, records, everywhere...
I've got my work cut out for me on this remix contest...some very good work was done by a LOT of people.  Inspirational
THANK YOU to everyone around the world who has been supporting "Scale It Back" at radio! Good music CAN win (occasionally)
Couldn't ask for a better end of the year than a sold-out show in London, where it all started for me...massive gratitude and respect
Quite possibly the final UK "Shadowsphere" show ever, tonight in London...come celebrate with @EngineEarz, @TheKnocks and myself
Great vibe at the Oxford gig tonight, was a pleasure meeting everyone at the signing afterward.  Until next time!
In Oxford for show tonight at O2 Academy, stage time is 9:20...cool that 2010 remix contest participants @TigerMendoza are supporting
An absolute joy today to pull back the curtain, remove the safety net and JUST DJ!!! Total chaos, thanks 2 @boilerroomtv & @roughtradeeast
@PlugWonDeLaSoul Where in the UK were you? Did you get caught in the snow? Rip it up in Bologna fam
Newcastle, England tonight: I take the stage at 9:20pm sharpish
I started with the oldest entries and am working my way forward...rest assured EVERY mix will be heard
About 1/3 of the way through the submissions for the remix contest...hit ratio for me is about 1 out of 10 so far.  A lot of nice ideas tho
I think it's safe to say that Winter has officially arrived in Glasgow! Very much looking forward to the show tonight @02ABC
Liverpool, was so nice meeting everyone after the show...lots of hardcore fans, thanks for all the support!!
Heading to sound check...show tonight in Liverpool @02 Academy, onstage at 9:20pm.  Last chance to see the Shadowsphere
Going through the remixes for the "Scale It Back" remix contest...trying to limit myself to 30 or so per day to stay objective.
Leeds...thank you for being so generous with your energy and positivity.  What a crowd! Respect.
The single biggest challenge facing musicians today: retaining artistic and personal dignity in an industry that rewards buffoonery
@ryanforrest82 I go on at 9:20 tonight, make sure you come for @EngineEarz at 8:15 if you can!
@DavetheBear58 Ha, that's why we do what we do...thanks for the note
@cojones1980 That would be the sensible thing to do, we're working on it! Cheers
Show tonight in Birmingham (England), but my immediate focus until then is to spend some quality time evaluating the "Scale It Back" remixes
Nottingham try to come early if you can to check out @EngineEarZ, should be a fun night...I go on at 9:30
Tonight it's Nottingham Rock City, what a privilege to still be able to play such a classic venue after all these years
Bristol show was nearly perfect...thanks to all who attended! Also thanks 2 Rise Records for allowing me 2 perform the all vinyl set earlier
Ok, back in the UK; Bristol tomorrow for not one but TWO shows, two completely different sets.  Feels good to stretch as a DJ.  #ILoveMyJob
Oh man, this #ScaleItBack remix contest isn't even finished yet and I have over 300 to listen to so far... http://t.co/5Jify4eQ
Also, if you'd like to go to one of the UK shows but you're on a tight budget, consider this option: http://t.co/gh9JLiZW
Something fun to do over the weekend: http://t.co/7sHW9D4s
The world premier of the "Scale It Back" video is live NOW courtesy our friends at http://t.co/PTT7EHez, check it out! http://t.co/gXen41v2
Doesn't matter how low I feel...plug in those two turntables and mixer, and in that moment I know...everything's gonna be alright.
@stewartalaniz I'm now being told 11/8 is the date, so sounds like next Tuesday. As far as why, I can only surmise low man on the totem pole
@therealKidKoala Ha thanks bro, well I still haven't figured out a better way to present it live than what u saw in Montreal
@exbarman That'd be amazing, can't wait to get back!
After a few days' sick leave, working on something kind of interesting for some upcoming UK in-stores...
Mexico City, it's going down tonight...
@Cut_Chemist Come up North man, you need to see this collection.  So juiced you won that Ultra Mag special, keeping it in the family
The Shadowsphere is officially in Mexico. Guadalajara tomorrow (Friday), Mexico City Saturday. #ILoveMyJob
Are you kidding me?  This World Series game 6 is a slug-fest
U get all those DJ's in one room, ur gonna learn sumthing. I learned that @Cut_Chemist is a really good chef. And Mix Trix on cassette? Wow
A great day in Glendale!!! Thanks fellas @Cut_Chemist @jrocc @ztrip @djnumark @gaslampkiller @djshadow http://t.co/bvaZxrgV
@DJUnit27 Hit me!!
@JahPetz Every tour is different. Vinyl won't work when u have a lot of outdoor shows, as I have on this tour. Last tour, it was all vinyl.
@checks1 I'm on at 1am, my friend, or so I'm told.
There comes a time in everyone's life when we need a helping hand. For DJ & friend @MrDibbs, that time is now. http://t.co/RJDKiuFe
Was great chopping it up with the homie @DJRevolution yesterday
Your chance to remix http://t.co/WPdZ2U62 my next single, "Scale It Back" feat. Little Dragon.  Download the stems, make something happen!
@yoMTVtrash Much appreciated, Ashley
Don't have anything to do today in Los Angeles? Then come down to @Amoebamusic, I'll be playing a short set and signing from 6pm-on.
@GASLAMPKILLER No, thank YOU!!
@Lilerific @fondamusicbox I'm on at 10pm tonite.
@DanteRoss Right now it's looking like Spring '12.  Played Irving Plaza last November though.
Last USA show of the year TONIGHT in Los Angeles w/ support from @GASLAMPKILLER.  These Cali dates have been cracking, don't want it 2 end!!
Arrived in San Diego, getting ready to play tonight at 4th & B with @GASLAMPKILLER should be a good night!!
And then tomorrow in San Diego and Sunday in Los Angeles, I'm being joined by @GASLAMPKILLER should be siiiiiiccccckkkkk....
Getting ready to head out to @RegencyBallroom in San Francisco for the show tonight...I go on at 10pm but check out @TruthspeakerHQ at 9pm
@NicoleJordan @scottalk Nice.  There's a bonus I'm waiting to announce as well
First-ever solo show in Santa Cruz tonight at the Catalyst.  Monterey, Salinas, Watsonville, San Jose, this one's for YOU #SantaCruz
Been looking for break-beats for going on 25 years, and JUST NOW discovered one of my top three...heavy, killer, and unknown. #ItNeverEnds
Portishead comes to the Bay for the first time in over a decade, and I have a show that night across town. Life is not fair. #SchedulingFail
@3migo Very nice of you to say, thank you.
Proud to welcome Quannum fam @TruthspeakerHQ, opening the shows in Santa Cruz & San Francisco; stay tuned for exciting news regarding So-Cal
Just a reminder, last California dates of the year: Santa Cruz (Oct. 20), San Francisco (Oct. 21), San Diego (Oct. 22) Los Angeles (Oct. 23)
W/out family, friends, & fans, I would be lost. It's so easy to get caught up in ego & pride...with humility I strive to OWN my shortcomings
Discovering, appreciating, and sharing the music of others is what makes being a DJ so rewarding.  #ILoveMyJob
@sachynsuch No worries man, it happens.
First solo San Francisco show in four years: Oct. 21 @RegencyBallroom Wanna see the whole Bay there!
@EngineEarz Already in the works man, check with Nick ;-)
@EngineEarz Ha yeah it's me...dude, "They Live" is one of the gnarliest tracks I've ever heard, seriously!!
@alazenby @MutinyRadioSF Sure, I'd be happy to do that.
@hellofromJYC Excellent, see you there!!
@JALaRochelle You will definitely hear two of them ;-)
Looking forward to this upcoming string of California dates next week: Santa Cruz, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles; then Mexico!
Beware PTADS: 'Post-Tour Adrenaline-Deficiency Syndrome'
@howardihno Really appreciate that!
Home, sweet home.
Brilliant end to the Asia leg of the tour, audiences in Japan are doing it BIG.  Thank u #AsagiriJam #StayStrongJapan
Whoa...this crowd is HUGE.  Playing in the shadow of Mt. Fuji
For me to focus on the negative is to disrespect my collaborators, my team, and my fans. I will learn from this and grow. #TLYKTB
Longest autograph signing session since '98 Unkle in-store, last night after Tokyo show.  Was great to see everyone!
@tcote @numerogroup @pitchfork It's become almost comically predictable. "If I could be...who you wanted..."- T Yorke
@DanteRoss James Brown's "Mother Popcorn"
@numerogroup @pitchfork Haha! Dude.  DUDE! I can't even take it seriously anymore. Lol
New favorite pastime: making rock critics hyperventilate.  ONWARD #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
So in case you missed it, we streamed just a small part of the Tokyo show live...an experiment for something much bigger planned...
@betsko Thx & to be completely honest, it stops fazing you after awhile.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I can hold my head up high
My show is Streaming LIVE right now from Japan - http://t.co/CFTFv0DG
Two shows for you this weekend, Japan: Tokyo show tonight at Blitz, 8pm.  Saturday at Asagiri Jam Festival, also at 8pm.  Hope 2 see u there

@jslydemusic Thank you very much.
@spade_hands They wanna try to keep me in press jail...All I care about is that real fans like it. #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@phontigallo Appreciation reciprocated Phonte...Charity Starts At Home!! --&gt;This Little Dragon & @DJShadow joint has been on CONSTANT repeat

@Rambler321 Appreciated sir!
@kingmajix Sad And Lonely isn't beautiful in your opinion? Thx
@philPTML I can dig it, thx
@JPBBoyce Yup, it's a straight-up trap.  Just happy that most hardcore fans are digging it, that's all that matters to me.  Gratitude
@JohnProduces Could not have put it better myself.
@Marshcp True fans know what's up.  Thx
Glad no one told Bambaataa he couldn't cover The MC5...or Flash that he couldn't mix Queen with Chic...Succeed or fail, DJ's yearn to learn
Since when is a DJ supposed 2 stick 2 playing or making 1 type of music? Rock critics wanna rewrite the rules...won't work. #LetTheDJDecide
@shadowygirl6 Thanks so much!! Glad to hear your thoughts
@DjAslan Thanks cousin, keep doing your thing! BTW, I was in the audience at DMC '99 (was reading your timeline) PTrix!!

@tsardony  High praise, thanks!
@unheard78  Only if I can clear the sample...still working on it  #SampleClearanceHeartbreaker
@unheard78  Well said!! Especially since like 3 corporations own all the stations
Speaking of enthusiasm, the flying fist fight during "I Gotta Rokk" last night in Chengdu, China was some straight punk rock mosh pit ish
First new album in 5 years "The Less You Know, The Better" drops today in most places; I appreciate the support and enthusiasm.  Long road
@Senor_Goat  O word?  Cool
@danielleperry @zanelowe @RobdaBank @anniemacdj  Thank you, thank you!
Other "radio suckers" exceptions:  NPR, @kcrw, and pretty much every college radio station.  But OTHER THAN THAT...(haha)
@mattzki  Haha ok I see your point, thx
Radio suckers never play me (applies to USA only!!!) Big shout to @zanelowe, @RobdaBank, @anniemacdj, & all others that support  #gratitude
@mattzki  Because they asked me about it.
First thing I'm going to do when I get home is spend about a week just listening to/ taping new music.  Time to update Shadow Radio
After 6 months on the road my sartorial game is DRAGGING.  Just want to burn my whole suitcase and start over, lol
@Belfastportal  Of course, that's the whole point Thanks
@DJ_FUNKY_C  That would be INCREDIBLE
Beijing rokked HARD tonight!!!!
@toptoga  Thanks family!
@toptoga  Agreed, and news to me.  Looking into it, ok?
@sachynsuch In a word, yes.  Had to cut the cancer to save the patient.  Still hope to clear it soon though.  Thanks for the question
@IrnMnky Thanks bro
Grew up loving hardcore beats but sometimes a ballad can be even harder. Emotion is more potent than bravado if you're not afraid to use it
Seen the 3xUSB version of the album yet? One of the coolest physical variants we've done in awhile...at my site next wk http://t.co/dPXupKvb
Meet album cover artist and co-conspirator Tony Papesh! You can see more of his world here: http://t.co/63C4TPRj

Thx for the feedback everyone and remember, musical diversity is not a crime (come to think of it that would make a good bumper sticker, ha)
@sadeagle Oh so maybe it works outside the US as well?  I dunno dude, I just know what they tell me lol.  So maybe it works everywhere!
Those in the USA can stream my new album "The Less You Know, The Better" a week early, courtesy our friends at NPR  http://t.co/7byb9IqD
Yeah so in the US, copies of the album sent to press had the tracks in default ALPHABETICAL ORDER....oops.  An honest mistake, but damn!!
Remind me to tell you all some day about the Great Track Listing Caper...you gotta hear it to believe it!!  #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@DanteRoss Damn dude thank you! Maximum respect right back at you!! Hit me up
Let me see some pictures of people underneath the new album billboard at Amoeba L.A.!  #TheLessYouKnowTheBetter
@JSMartinII Astral Projection on Maverick (with promotional company flyer) among the highlights #45sInThailand
@djtonypsalms Dude you're not lying, there was a Quannum 12" for "Extravaganza" in there as well...
You nailed it.  But even so, unplayed '60s garage rock 45's from Texas?  Under an inch of dust? -&gt; @drknife My bet is military servicemen.
The psychic migration of vinyl never ceases to astound me. Found some stuff today in Thailand that defies explanation; how did it get here??
@thisisjohnbook Hi John. I read it, and I thank you.  I am at peace with my successes, my failures, and ultimately, myself.
Ok, so I have a new album coming out in like 9 days.  First new album in 5 years.  I invite your attention 2 this space over the coming days
I know I am terrible at social networking.  I choose to focus my limited time and energy on the music I make.  Pls forgive my shortcomings
Going on at 10pm tonight @Demo in Bangkok, Thailand
Take a look at your "I Gotta Rokk" vinyl.  If it has marbled 'splash wax,' you have something very rare on your hands...
In 2011, if you're not making uber-pop, fan support is not only necessary, it's absolutely essential.  Thanks 2 every1 for supporting so far
Yes, Singapore!! Great show tonight @Zouk, thanks to everyone for treating us so well
Found a vintage 8mm print of 'That Man Bolt' today at a thrift market in Jakarta. #ilovemyjob

Getting ready to sound check in Cardiff...first show in Wales in 15 years!! Last time was opening for Radiohead...damn, time flies
What a relief, so nice to play to an appreciative audience...nothing makes me feel better than seeing girls on shoulders @ElectricPicnic
30 minutes til show.  Santigold just came off, crowd dug her a lot.  Nervous about the new stuff I added, no chance to rehearse it
No matter where I go in the world, the temperature drops 10 degrees the moment I land...everyone on the tour calls me 'Mr. Freeze'

@mrbenone Signing the CDs when I get back to SF next week, I would be very surprised if Bristol was not on the itinerary next year...thanks!
Didn't have them then! Just got it in this week...@surflogic "you should have left some in London during Wireless Festival"
Have started leaving vinyl around the towns I visit...hard to find but it's out there. Maybe soon I'll post some pix of what they look like

Tomorrow is my first ever set in Ibiza...yes, you read that correctly!! Hopefully providing an antidote to the usual club same old thing...
Domaize, France: thousands of EXTREMELY enthusiastic youths in a field, jumping up and down to Organ Donor...what more could a DJ ask for?

@JWDijk @l33chbert @jwalphenaar Thanks, was nice to play in a city outside of Amsterdam for a change...I think tonight will be great
