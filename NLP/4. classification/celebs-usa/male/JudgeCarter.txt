I’m glad to see this shutdown end and federal employees be paid. It’s now time to negotiate and address the very serious situation on the southern border.
I'm excited to introduce you to a new intern in our Temple office! Meet Joel Loua, a Poli Sci major at @UMHB.  He's an Army cadet with UMHB's Army ROTC and plays on the university's soccer team. Fun fact about Joel, he is fluent in French. Welcome to Team Carter, Joel! https://t.co/kvUi31LBFg
Speaker Pelosi flat out refused to consider the President’s proposal, despite the fact that it would provide protections for DACA recipients, something Democrats have continually wanted in the past. They are more focused on obstructing than negotiating.
ALL Republicans voted FOR it. For the Democrats, it isn't about paying federal employees or reopening the government. Their unwillingness to negotiate shows that their only goal is to obstruct.
This vote would've paid all federal employees during the shutdown until a solution is reached...215 Democrats just voted AGAINST it. https://t.co/fWjvGibReX
By rejecting President Trump’s latest compromise without even making a counter offer, Nancy Pelosi has shown she’s not interested in negotiating to reopen the government. It is beyond time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats to come to the table to negotiate.

It’s past time for the Democrats to negotiate, provide funding for border security and reopen the government.
Democrats have made it clear that they are unwilling to negotiate, despite evidence of a growing crisis at the border. Law enforcement professionals need resources to do their job, including a barrier, to slow down illegal border crossings, so they can apprehend individuals.
#LawEnforcement officers put their lives on the line every day. Join me in saying thank you for all they do to keep our community safe. #LawEnforcementAppreciation #BackTheBlue https://t.co/HTkiFEyI64
get border patrol agents what they need to do their job safely and effectively, and reopen the government.
Texans see firsthand the impacts of a porous border. We are on the frontlines and it’s obvious we need additional border security measures, including physical barriers. Democrats need to come to the table and negotiate with @POTUS to get our southern border secured,

In 2013 Senator Schumer said, “No matter how strongly one feels about an issue, you shouldn’t hold millions of people hostage.” Fund our troops, provide for low-income children, end the #SchumerShutdown #SenateDemocrats https://t.co/kx0gkQgUYq
A shutdown means our troops will work without pay, and 9 million children from low and middle-income families will lose funding for their health care. Democrats ought to be ashamed. #SchumerShutdown
I never thought I would see the day when Democrats put noncitizens above the American military and our children in need. The Democrats’ reckless decision to hold the American people hostage over unrelated immigration issues is completely irresponsible.
It’s irresponsible and reckless for #SenateDemocrats to hold our heroes and our kids hostage. Fund the government now.
House #Republicans have done their job and sent legislation to the #Senate to keep the government open, extend #CHIP for 6 years and provide for our military. Unfortunately, Democrats are willing to shut the government down over unrelated immigration issues

@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepRoybalAllard Homan: "what the men and women of our agencies do is extremely dangerous and is very American."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepRoybalAllard Homan: we run through a very elaborate system for over-stated visas.
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepRoybalAllard @RepAndyHarrisMD: "what is .@ICEgov doing to find and re-patriot those who have over stayed their visas?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD .@RepRoybalAllard: "Part of the reason we are in this situation is because Congress has not done their job."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD Homan: "you can't say, 'I want to be apart of the greatest country on earth...but I do not want to follow their laws."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD Homan: "the policies by sanctuary campuses mis-message .@ICEgov. We don't arrest in schools. You don't need a school policy for that."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepAndyHarrisMD: "Sanctuary universities refuse to work with ICE. Where else is @ICEgov not allowed to go?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD Homan: "if you are the victim of a misdemeanor or 'minor crime' it isn't minor. It means something."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD @RepAndyHarrisMD: "I disagree with people who are going to look the other way who think DWI offenses are 'minor crimes.'
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson @RepAndyHarrisMD Homan: "in my experience, I haven't found that to be true...the rule of law means something to these people (local law enforcement)."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo @CongCulberson .@RepAndyHarrisMD: "do local law enforcement agents dislike interacting with .@ICEgov?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo .@CongCulberson: "local and state jurisdictions cannot in anyway interfere with federal law enforcement's dealings with illegal immigrants"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo Provost: "they (illegal crossings) are the lowest numbers we have seen in years."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo .@CongCulberson: "just from .@POTUS  enforced direction, illegal crossings have decreased by more than 75%. Is that correct?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo Carter: "it is dangerous for an officer to approach a residence..in defense of Mr. Homan; I agree with him...God bless you all and thank you
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva @CongPalazzo Provost: "We have apprehended some. That is a top priority for us. We work very closely with @ICEgov to handle hose threats."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva .@CongPalazzo: "what about foreign nationals...people that want to do us harm, have y'all apprehended any?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva Homan: "@ICEgov does not separate families. The perpetrator and the violator splits up his/her family."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva Homan: "if someone has a DWI, yes. That is an offense worth being removed. If someone has entered illegally that is a federal offense."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva .@Call_Me_Dutch: "what is @ICEgov exact policy on deportation?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar @Scotttaylorva Provost: "the Steel Bollard wall is our preferred wall of what we currently have in our toolkit; however, we support innovation."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar .@Scotttaylorva: "is there a standard practice or a desired standard for fencing?"
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder @RepCuellar Wagner: "we are looking at new truck screening technology and what exactly is he best technology."
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder .@RepCuellar what are your plans to fix the damage done to the port of Loredo (the world trade bridge)?
@ICEgov @RepNewhouse @CustomsBorder Provost: "we are very excited to begin piloting small UASes...we believe these will be very beneficial for our men and women on the ground."
@ICEgov .@RepNewhouse: "how far off we where technology can support immediate @CustomsBorder operations?"
@ICEgov Homan: "...there are no sweeps. There are no raids. I want people to go to church. I want people to go to school."
Homan: "the men and women of .@ICEgov know exactly who they are going to arrest and the exact location of where they will arrest them at...
Homan: "our arrests are up by over 50% are detainers are up by over 75%."
Homan: "I think 51,000 is a good number...we have opened the aperture for who we are looking to arrest, detain, or remove."
.@RepRoybalAllard: "does .@ICEgov have a requirement for the 51,379 detention beds in FY18 and what is that based on?"
Provost: "San Diego, El Paso, and El Centro are the priority areas of old, outdated fencing that need the most attention."
Carter: "where and when will you begin the construction of this replacement fencing and doyou know the exact location?"
Provost: "it is always .@CustomsBorder goal to work with the landowner to find a resolution on those property rights."
Carter: "we pride ourselves in TX on our property rights...we violently fight for our property rights."
Provost: "We are working towards, if we receive the funding, being able to start in March or April in 2018."
Provost: "there are areas where there are natural barriers and here is no requirement for a wall."
Provost: "the Rio Grande valley is a high priority area for us and is an area where we lack a lot of infrastructure."
Carter question to provost concerning infrastructure covering: types of barriers, contractor information and private property laws in TX
Provost: "in its simplest state it is being able to impede and deny entry and having situational awareness until agents can respond."
Provost: "operational control is not new to the @CustomsBorder...we created 'operational control.'
Carter question to Provost: "how do you define the requirements for operational control of the border?"
@JudgeCarter: "we are a current event...we must remember that and must do a serious inquiry."
@ICEgov .@HouseAppropsGOP #HomelandSecurity hearing with @ICEgov &amp; @CustomsBorder for the #2018Budget https://t.co/eAFlMD3vvM
Homan: "@ICEgov officers don't do what they do out of hate for what's in front, they do it out of love for what's behind them."
Homan: "if a federal judge's decision is not enforced, then there is absolutely no integrity in this entire system."
Homan cont..."they have the right to be proud of the enormous contribution they make to our nation's safety and security."
Homan: "@ICEgov officials have the right to end their shift safely and return to their families everyday....
Wagner: "Last year @CustomsBorder officers inspected over 390 million travelers and arrested over 8,000 individuals wanted for serious crime
Provost: "@CustomsBorder is the finest border security force in the world."
