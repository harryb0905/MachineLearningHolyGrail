Congrats to Colin, Eric and all the future athletes who will be positively impacted by the settlement. We need to push harder on the wheels of the justice system. In two years, I've seen no movement in my case. I appreciate the fans especially the people of NY for their support.

No player in the history of the game has put together the body of work Lebron has.
Excellent point guard on the court and leader on the bench. Gook luck to @MarkJackson13. People shouldn't believe everything they read. https://t.co/JkmXmVhNTw
Everybody talking about goaltending - that's two points. Lebron hit a 3 to win the game so get them two points and the score still 98-97, Cavs win.
Donovan Mitchell is a more athletic Joe Dumars. Ben Simmons is in his own lane. I think we will be seeing Co-Rookie‚Äôs of the Year.
90s Basketball was alive and well yesterday. Teams were feisty and ready to go war for their teammates. Let‚Äôs see what today brings
Miami beat themselves. Shot 52% from the line and Sixers with 26 turnovers.
