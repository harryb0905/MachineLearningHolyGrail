My whole feed rn is all ppl who loved Brody. I knew Brody, but not as well as I know depression, and I can guess that Brody knew how much he was loved, and by how many people, and it still didn‚Äôt stop him. Depression is a fucking killer. Don‚Äôt ever underestimate it. Get help now.

@KateHarding I agree that our society is an ageist sexist crap bag, but she handled that badly.

TREASURE HUNT: Find one black person on Twitter defending Liam Neeson. Hucksters don‚Äôt count
Jesus some of you are exhausting
Ppl in this thread still saying ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it good to give voice to bad thoughts so we can learn from them?‚Äú If an action star talked casually about how he used to want to abuse children, would you defend him? Or would you rightfully see that as the possible normalization of evil?
Also, I‚Äôd bet a few car payments that every fucker on here speaking up for him wouldn‚Äôt have a syllable of defense for a black action star who told a similar anecdote about a random white guy
@weismanjake Oh
The urge to get revenge against an innocent black stranger is an aberrant malignancy of hate that should never be spoken, lest a bunch of shallow white ppl think that it‚Äôs a naturally occurring naughty thought.  It‚Äôs fucking evil; keep it to yourself and feel shame.
‚ÄúI got so mad at my mommy that I wished she was dead‚Äù is something you can own up to to be relatable.  ‚ÄúI wanted to brutalize a random black guy‚Äù has literally caused the deaths of countless ppl.
Jesus Christ, ppl came to this tweet to fucking defend him. ‚ÄúA black person allegedly did a crime, so I was gonna go commit violence against a random black person‚Äù is not an oopsie that you just own up to in order to boast about how far you‚Äôve come. It‚Äôs ACTUAL UGLY HISTORY
@weismanjake Oh I don‚Äôt deal with pages.  I‚Äôll just tell it to whomever the agency sends over

There‚Äôs all kinds of things in that Bible that we don‚Äôt do anymore because we realized they‚Äôre stupid and barbaric and wrong. You pick and choose, Christian. Deciding to tell kids they‚Äôre born bad should‚Äôve been one of them ages ago.
This is bullshit, so keep it off of kids. This should be self-evident, regardless of what your interpretation of an ancient book says. https://t.co/Q8l5ZoPFqB
Any institution that cares for children that tells them being gay is bad or sinful is committing abuse. They are hurting kids. Period.
This is still on my mind, because it is not about some benign differing belief.  It is about a school that is telling some of the children that go there that they‚Äôre born wrong. We know enough now to know that is ignorant, destructive cruelty.

Wife just said ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs Richard Hatch, he was the first season winner,‚Äù and my 13 yo daughter (who of course had no idea who won) executed a world class slow burn at her. Oopsie!
@PFTompkins @Walrus_Legend That earned that guy a block
My daughter &amp; I are watching the first season of Survivor on Hulu &amp; the way the other tribe members talk about Richard Hatch‚Äôs sexuality is SO cringey. World‚Äôs not perfect, but at least we know how to talk about gayness better than we did 18 years ago.
@MrEmilyHeller Yippee!
@AlbertBrooks Was lucky enough to work with him a couple of times and he was so goddamned funny. So unapologetically, wonderfully himself.  An absolute Jedi master at not giving a shit what anybody thought of him.  I will miss him, and I‚Äôm thinking of you &amp; your family.

@cavaticat @spookperson This is one of the nicest things I‚Äôve ever heard. Thank you!
The GOP saying Dems don‚Äôt care about border security because they won‚Äôt pay for the wall is like grandpa saying you don‚Äôt care about grandma‚Äôs health because you won‚Äôt let him use her insulin money to pay for a witch doctor to treat her diabetes
Meaning, for Romney types, Trump could cage all the kids he wants if only he weren‚Äôt such a tacky asshole
That Mitt Romney op-ed reveals that the most dangerous thing Trump could do would be to become 10% more polite

The PC police are not ruining comedy. It is a challenging time to be making jokes. You either accept the challenge or retreat into a past that was easier for you. I hope that this kind of selfish, easy, decency-contrarianism soon becomes as hack as airline food and mother-in-laws
We are seeing a cliche in action.  Comedy man meets consequences. Comedy man becomes ‚Äútruth teller‚Äù by fishing in a barrel of societally sensitive topics.  What a gigantic yawn. What a waste.  What a lost opportunity for an artist to do some art.
Now there‚Äôs a lot of revisionist history about Louis‚Äô work, mainly that he was never funny. That is not true. Years ago Louis could be stone cold brilliant. About relationships. About parenthood. About the fucking human condition.  That‚Äôs why this is all such a bummer for me.
I can‚Äôt say that the hackiness of what Louis said was the main thing, because he said some fucked up stuff (i.e., denying bravery of Parkland survivors advocacy is untrue. Shitting on trans ppl is small &amp; mean). But wow, was it lazy. Wow, was it EASY.
(Also comedy is on a continuum. You can‚Äôt pluck someone out of the historical timeline and plop them down somewhere else. Today‚Äôs comedy is what it is bc of yesterday‚Äôs comedy. The jokes of today have to be what they are because of the jokes of the past)
‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs environment (fill in blank w name of legendary stand up) wouldn‚Äôt succeed!‚Äù Stand up from 50 yrs ago wouldn‚Äôt work? No shit! Comedy is the most perishable form of entertainment. Shit just stops being funny. We‚Äôve all watched old SNL‚Äôs &amp; experienced this.
But there is some comedy that sucks and it‚Äôs bad for people imo. Some comedy sucks and it‚Äôs bad for comedy imo.  And if I yell ‚ÄúBoo!‚Äù that is not censorship. It‚Äôs just not a laugh. And if you tell jokes that‚Äôs the risk you run. No sense crying about it.
I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time judging the quality of other‚Äôs comedy (it mostly just comes off as adolescent &amp; insecure). My taste isn‚Äôt the law. People like what they like. What do I care? Some comedy sucks. What do I care?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna show that I‚Äôm not afraid to mock this upsetting thing that most ppl don‚Äôt find funny‚Äù is not brave.  It‚Äôs not hilarious because it offends some people.  It‚Äôs a FORMULA, and an increasingly lazy one.

@behindyourback An unfair version of this is when I argue with my kids in public.  It doesn‚Äôt bother me that some ppl know who i am (every family argues, so I‚Äôm not embarrassed to be human), but it does bother them.  So I have to be careful. Even when they‚Äôre being dicks.
Sometimes in life you decide you want something, &amp; that you want it so bad that you don‚Äôt care whose feelings you hurt. And so you push hard, maybe too hard. And then when you get the thing, you realize you don‚Äôt even want it. Take, for instance, this fucking figgy pudding

I can‚Äôt believe that any of these fuckers are still talking about that goddamned wall with a straight face. We are living in Dum Dum Town. They might as well be shutting down the government because no one will fund the time machine they want to build for the Easter Bunny.
‚ÄúWorst December stock market performance since the Great Depression‚Äú. And GOP leaders are going to let this asshole shut down the government.  What part of ‚Äúgood for business‚Äú is this?
@owillis She just loves the color of blood
This functions as a pretty comprehensive list of why Trump is a criminal disaster.  And all of it is the fault of the GOP. https://t.co/R2FymIkQWr
@marcellacomedy AMEN
I used to screen grab ppl‚Äôs anti-gun control tweets to protect them when I responded &amp; I decided to stop.  Why protect the comfort of ppl who aren‚Äôt interested in protecting anyone else?
@RheaButcher Too many of them reflexively say no to anything vaguely resembling restriction. Hopefully that‚Äôs changing
If I‚Äôm talking about guns &amp; I address someone‚Äôs tweet, don‚Äôt bother telling me ‚Äúhe‚Äôs only got ten followers.‚Äù He represents a lot of ppl.  I‚Äôm talking to them &amp; I‚Äôm talking to you. &amp;I don‚Äôt give a shit about ppl piling on that guy. Fuck gun worship.  Fuck promoters of gun death.
Also seeing dismissive ‚Äúmost gun deaths are gang related‚Äù horseshit  in these @‚Äòs, as if there‚Äôs 2 different kinds of dead kids. Fuck that. You think just because you attach the word ‚Äúgang‚Äù you absolve your white self of voting for paid-for pols who flood the US w guns? Nope.
Also, for most folks a rise in preventable violent child death tends to arouse emotions.
I‚Äôll go slow.   The article is about leading causes of US child death.  The top 3 are car wrecks, guns &amp; cancer.  All 3 kill kids. That makes them related!  You compared 2 of them, so you must know they‚Äôre related w/o even realizing it!    Glad to help.   https://t.co/GQYVLKp3E2
We already have ‚Äúautomobile reform‚Äù numbnuts. Licensed owning and operating, restrictive safety laws, etc. If we treated guns like we treat cars we‚Äôd save countless kids‚Äô lives and you‚Äôd STILL get to play bang bang w your stupid fucking toys.  https://t.co/ZYjPDBuFhd
@RheaButcher Difference is that‚Äôs actually being treated like a problem worth acknowledging and solving by most people and the entire auto industry
Look at that statement.  Enough is enough.  Any talk about ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù or ‚Äúrights‚Äù is a pile of dangerous, murderous lies.  Our children are dying and they don‚Äôt have to.  There is blood on many hands.  Is there any on yours? https://t.co/PZi19EZ014

@spookperson Get with the times, dopes!
If I were gay, I‚Äôd be loudly and proudly gay. I just happen to be straight.  To try and tease me with some thuddingly dumb insinuation that I‚Äôm not straight is boring, lame, and belligerently dumb. It‚Äôs an incredibly lazy punchline. Work harder.  Do better.
...Lots of people are gay.  Lots of people are left handed.  Lots of people are hockey fans. To get a tittering thrill out of insinuating that someone might be gay is really lame.  And slightly hate perpetuating. No one thinks that‚Äôs ok anymore. Grow the fuck up.
...and I‚Äôve always felt like responding to these @‚Äòs by saying what is so fucking hilarious about being gay?  I‚Äôm not gay. But what‚Äôs so embarrassingly funny about it?  Why do you think it‚Äôs such a hilarious inside joke to remind me of?...
I honestly don‚Äôt recollect these moments, which is one of the drawbacks of being on tv for thousands of hours. However, over the yrs I have often had fans of Norm refer to me as ‚ÄúSwedish German‚Äù &amp; I‚Äôve always know that it was some sort of joke code for ‚Äúgay‚Äù...
...for the life of me, I could not exactly remember the origin of these ‚ÄúSwedish German‚Äù references (other than knowing they were about Norm), so I did a You Tube search and it produced this: https://t.co/Prp47VbXKJ
The topic of my heritage has inspired a few responses of ‚ÄúSwedish-German,‚Äù which i have gotten throughout the yrs. They are from Norm McDonald fans, and I had an idea that they are insinuating that Swedish-German is a euphemism for gay...
