@zombietardis Great!!!
@cslamb5 Wow! Looking good, my friend! Thank you for listening to my songs!
@cslamb5 Wha?!?!! That‚Äôs incredible! Happy birthday!!!
@KateAurthur Ha ha! Hmmm... Burrito Van is kind of an obscure one. Thank you for the clip!
@KateAurthur Hi Kate! Thank you for listening to the songs. Please tell your sons that I appreciate it!
@RJLunn Thank you for the suggestion! **writes ‚Äúbat eating a cupcake‚Äù on to-do list**
@Aquadragon01 ha ha! Wow! That's a lot of frogs on one snake!
@Jawsh86 @PunkoCastle I‚Äôm too lazy to sue anybody. And that‚Äôs a great song! Happy to share the notes.
@mclars @linusdotson @AngryObie I did the robot voices on the dinosaur songs (and planet songs), but the songs and raps were done by the incredible genius super-talent Erik Weiner ( https://t.co/A1j3Im0HDW ). Those hip-hop songs are amazing!
@ddribin Happy Holidays to you and your family! Thank you for the kind words!
@patrickoriley Yup! That‚Äôs me! I love the @SantaBarbaraZoo ! Did you really win the New Yorker caption contest?
@humanleon @Spotify Ha ha! My favorite song of mine is "Space Unicorn" or "Turtle", although I switch around a lot. Song by someone else, "Rock Lobster" by The B-52s is way up there. It's super rocking, and it's about a lobster! Bruno inspired the backwards rabbit song, and starred in the video.
@humanleon Please thank your son for listening to my music on @Spotify. My rabbit Bruno likes fancy organic vegetables, and Spotify helps to pay for them!
Sleepytime Zoo! It's very relaxing to visit. https://t.co/I2D6ZrqCP5

@WiFiler That's good advice! I've found that my best songs are written about ideas that I'm personally interested in, not about what I  think others would want to hear. And a cat flushing a toilet is very interesting to me!
Amazing!!! The first demo I made was already really fast, but then @VivziePop asked me to come up with an even faster part for the end. I was worried about someone being able to sing it, but @ElsieLovelock nails it! https://t.co/BQaEVaurYD

Fun at the dump today! It's outdoors, there's lots of weird stuff to look at, and you get to watch a bulldozer push old treadmills around.
