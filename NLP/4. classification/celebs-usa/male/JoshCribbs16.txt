@toysnyder97 @HARyder @JacorienB @JacobAWohl Patriotism is becoming the new Racism, when you say respect the flag or armed forces you say your justice is not important or an issues
@toysnyder97 @HARyder @JacorienB @JacobAWohl You can definitely kneel against injustice while respecting law enforcement, these issues are not the opposites of each other or relate
@toysnyder97 @HARyder @JacorienB @JacobAWohl You are so right! The issue is injustice/brutality not about law enforcement or flag
@Kennysen Almost finished my MBA, 🤚🏾hold on who are you &amp; what?
@DanielStackhou7 It's only about injustice the country has several issues but let's stay focused on the major issue in play
@DanielStackhou7 Or kneel for that matter against injustice with noe distractions about the reason for doing so
@DanielStackhou7 What is the point your making? The time is now bc it has reached a boiling point we all know it's true so why can't we all stand against it?
@DanielStackhou7 No not at this point we need constant leadership

@malbaugh1 @RyanShazier If everybody decided not to offend ppl during a protest, there would still be segregation &amp; no rights for ppl of color
@sixdtwo &amp; that if it's in the constitution then it's American &amp; I support it bc we honor our troops by our actions not our gestures..thank you Again
@sixdtwo You &amp; other soldiers must tell the country, so what if ppl are offended you fought for the constitution not the flag
@sixdtwo Now help defend the NFL players rights to do what you fought for!!! Nobody has to agree, that's what makes the country great,
@sixdtwo Not seeing the vision does not disqualify the cause or protest... you fought to give us the right do whatever, thank you
@sixdtwo 1st Thank you from the bottom, the Vietnam War was brutal, I grew up on the stories from my dad &amp; uncles just want to thank u 4 your courage
@mashields Players have an off day every Tuesday usually,  all across the league their out doing community service I did it for years it's what we do
@TCMow When players take a knee it's offensive to ppl who have justice already, offensive to those who don't care about what are soldiers fight4
@TCMow Soldiers my mom &amp; dad friends &amp; family took oaths to defend the Constitution not the flag
@TCMow Please be on the right side of history it's being made again, look back on all that has happened, slavery/civil rights/voting there 2 sides
@TCMow Thank U for being a fan I'm so grateful for that, can I ask you how u feel about injustice &amp; which is more important disrespect or Justice?
@cleveland19news #nfl
Love how Cleveland was well represented in front of the country today amidst the political &amp; social turmoil. Lead by Dee &amp; Jimmy H @Browns https://t.co/ImmSpZOyOB
@justinjakab @ZTproperties The timing the ppl none of that matters only Justice for all
@justinjakab @ZTproperties It was never about one person only injustice
@justinjakab @ZTproperties Maybe u right but it's not about him...
@justinjakab @ZTproperties lol it reached the point of protest 9/1/16
@ZTproperties Exactly so you know you can't trust this poll, also it's right vs wrong I just believe if change is to occur it must rock the boat
@ZTproperties @NFL Back then a lot of ppl were against her too, just like now just be on the right side of history
@ZTproperties Only 1400 ppl took part in the poll... 70% of white ppl who were polled were against it... you have to do better research &amp; read thru it
@ZTproperties That was written sept 2016
@ZTproperties Reasonable won't bring justice
@ZTproperties Your numbers are completely &amp; utterly false lease research before tossing out a number
@ZTproperties pre conditions will not get any justice, the cause must be greater than the penalties &amp; risk if it's not don't confuse action with results
@covell81 Injustice
@kwrnr1961 We dishonor them by not standing for what they faught for, they didn't die for a flag they died for what the flag stands for!!!
@ZTproperties So glad Rosa Parks had the courage to get arrested, bc that changed our future, again make sure you are on the right side of history @NFL
@ZTproperties This is history being made right now around the NFL, taking a knee to protest injustice, make sure you are on the right side of history!!!
@ZTproperties I'm Glad Rosa Parks got arrested bc nothing would've changed if protesters listen to the Nay Sayers &amp; didn't offend anyone
@ZTproperties I'm glad that Martin Luther King Jr didn't listen to ppl telling him not to have the bus boycott, they told him to to do something else too
@ZTproperties U respect the flag but do you care what it stands for at all or do you just say respect the flag regardless if what it stands for isn't true
@ZTproperties Im a Marine brat 2 parents Vietnam grandfather WWII mom/Dad both been police for over 25yrs
@ZTproperties Then you should be mad like anybody else to hear that what the soldiers are dying for is not being given
@bwalk_27 Don't follow your point??? What does this mean or pertain to?
@ZTproperties It just means you don't care as much about the "Justice for All" as you do for respecting the flag, that stands for the thing not given😑
Love it how teams unite in order to urge the country to unite as well! https://t.co/OEyNpvOTYC

@LittleKitty469 Your comment says hey injustice is bad but it's not worse than disrespecting offended veterans (all are not offended)😑 you can't see that?
@LittleKitty469 I'm so sorry but when u say #alllivesmatter it's like saying forget Texas/Florida All States matter😑 u see how that sounds?
@LittleKitty469 Both my parents family &amp; friends have served &amp; support
@LittleKitty469 Justice vs Disrespect, What is more important?
@LittleKitty469 Our soldiers died in WWII in order to  defeat Naziism so where was this rhetoric in response to Charlottesville ??
@LittleKitty469 Please answer this do you know or care why players are taking a knee?
@LittleKitty469 Calling kids names?
Exactly!!! https://t.co/UreOVcXZSn
@LittleKitty469 Our children at times are disrespectful to us parents, their not sons of b's... also is injustice more disrespectful to the soldiers???
Awesome statement from Dee &amp; Jimmy Haslam 🙌🏾💯 #leadership https://t.co/lWXw6NcVNa
@KevinKvasnok12 Oh ok I disagree bc taking a knee is not hating &amp; is peaceful, standing against the players says that you don't care about justice for all
@mommy1624 @NFL If we don't have what our soldiers are fighting for then why do they fight, just to say we have the freedom to protest or justice?
@mommy1624 @NFL With respect, That's not making a point as a country we honor our soldiers with action in providing justice for all bc that's why they fight
@Tomboh36 Not true most ppl are not even in their seats during the anthem at the stadium or at home
@KevinKvasnok12 I'm not sure I understand exactly what you are getting at
🏈Game Day!!! #dawgs #nfl good old days #joehaden lead block https://t.co/52HxSdiK29
@mommy1624 That's not fair to say what if it stops injustice, then would it be worth it, or does that matter ?
@rydog23 Thank you👍🏾🙌🏾
@doorknocker1 @TonyZ19 @WOIOSports @BeanieWells26 @bobgolic @cleveland19news Wow we disagree so now your not a fan??? Thanks for all the support thus far 👍🏾
@SteveStrah If ppl are comfortable with any protest then it's not effective &amp; should end &amp; try again
@SteveStrah Then turn around &amp; still do what we are paid to do &amp; at the highest of levels on the planet!
@SteveStrah They don't pay us to care about the community &amp; the ppl in it of all races, ethnicities, or religion, we do that on our own
@dominicpallone 👍🏾no don't stop send all my family &amp; friends to war &amp; say their fighting for freedom &amp; justice, eventually we'll get it, if we salute more😑
@dominicpallone So what if we don't have Justice let's salute the flag anyway bc it's one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for some😑
@SteveStrah And I guarantee you if you walk into your job  take a knee before you start &amp; get up &amp; do your job like athletes you will still have a job😑
@SteveStrah Take a knee with us it shows you are against injustice are you for injustice???
@SteveStrah Huh???? We are paid to play football, We play football🤷🏽‍♂️ what does kneeling have to do with playing football??? It's injustice we kneel4
@terrytesmer It says I don't care about your ppls injustice I only care  about the country😑
@terrytesmer Some who are against players taking a knee are unintentionally standing for injustice, caring more about ideals than human rights!!
@terrytesmer Those who hate it give more attention to its purpose... Muhammad Ali was hated too now everyone looks back to see he was right...
@terrytesmer Yea but u just proved my point... the fact u doing for ppl who can't, the world wasn't focused on injustice until Kaepernick took a knee
@terrytesmer I love what our country stands for &amp; strives to be, we are not there yet
@terrytesmer I'm sorry to confuse you, if you care more about respecting the flag than human rights, you make the call on what that is...
@Jcs1311 It is not against NFL policy to take a peaceful knee, take a knee at your job, they will expect you to be there the next day😑
@terrytesmer Our soldiers are fighting for something that's not given... that's disrespectful to our Soldiers!!!Everyone needs to stand with the players
@terrytesmer Evil only prevails when Good ppl do nothing!!! If injustice is wrong recognize call it out take a knee with players! Black/White/brown
@terrytesmer The entire stadium should kneel &amp; then the country who stands with each other will unite  Patriotism is turning into the new Racism
@Jcs1311 To ask for respect over justice is what's disrespectful, bc why are they fighting if we don't have what their fighting for?
@Jcs1311 Understand but disagree bc if we are to be men of our word in the community, how can we be true &amp; not stand for them in their time of need
@_BrownsOC I'm a Marine Brat sir both parents Vietnam grandfather WW2 they fought for justice or should we continue to pretend
Remember the ending of the "Pledge of Allegiance" with Liberty &amp; Justice for All....not some..sooo do we just edit the ending or Kneel?
Their sacrificing all the scrutiny for #injustice for an entire ppl..
Ppl say NFL players need to be happy they in this country making money, WHATTTT!!!!! Their not taking knees for themselves!!!

@tomscocca @GeorgeFoster72 Exactly....smh not all of them tho to be clear!
@MikeSev3 When ppl don't recognize the plight of the oppressed before stating your opinions make certain ppl appear to be inconsiderate or racist....
@MikeSev3 At what cost is it disrespectful? So what is injustice? Which one are you more upset about you see the problem, the dilemma?
@MikeSev3 We dishonor vets when everything they fought for isn't upheld,I'm a Marine brat, my folks are mad they fought for ideals that are not true.
@MikeSev3 when ppl say it's disrespectful it's saying forget all your human rights &amp; injustice respect the flag &amp; vets I choose vets over your rights
@MikeSev3 That's why I feel that in instances where there is injustice, ppl ignore it &amp; scream patriotism, make sure it's not the new racism
@MikeSev3 Cleveland Police did not refuse just the union president &amp; a few officers read the article from the police chief
@KevinKvasnok12 So more ppl who are with vets should join the protest bc soldiers fight for rights all Americans don't get that's the crime, &amp; is the focus
@KevinKvasnok12 Understand that vets fought for all the freedoms of the constitution, rights they fought for are not being preserved
@KevinKvasnok12 I've asked &amp; talked to several vets there's a divide, be careful that Patriotism doesn't turn into the new Racism

@phialphasae @Jaydawg_74 I respect your but feel our salary has nothing to do with anything, &amp; to suggest it does disrespects the cause at which we are fighting for
@Jaydawg_74 Definitely understand that, but injustice to many isn't nonsense, &amp; it's a good moment to do it at least we are discussing it, thanks again!

@angela_rye @VanJones68 so bc it answer questions by claiming Executive Privilege they have to claim it's not invoked in order to protect it
@angela_rye @VanJones68 Execuyive Privilege was used in such a way that they can't speak on it, if they claim it, it answers questions
@VanJones68 @angela_rye doesn't it look like Executive Privilege was exercised? The president doesn't have to make public neither do they

@PauleyAlioto discuss the actual picture not the act of me posting it, only interested in intellectual convo;have none, then keep swiping
@ZaneInTheValley pretty good conclusion 🤔

@vegaspapi no judgement just read what I said regardless lives were loss it's too much killing
@ryantc213 as u would with any job, but knowing what I know I would still play just smarter
@ryantc213 the concern is knowledge and being informed, money/career not even the issue, dig deeper intellectually below the surface
@tmaloy68 It's bringing the awareness to the public an media which allows the majority of athletes to become aware &amp; ask questions etc
@tmaloy68 I missed it what did I say that your confused about?
@UA7TypeS right!!!where's the news coverage
@joshuachalicky they may be justified bc they were scared but it upsets real police officers who fight that fear to protect &amp; serve!!!
@joshuachalicky the fear in them should not have caused the loss of life when several alternatives existed
@joshuachalicky my good friends are police officers, their upset bc the lack of courage those officers showed.
@joshuachalicky my father has been a police officer over 25years my mother-in-law over 15years both are more than upset.
Yet another police shooting in Minnesota 😔I'm about to just turnoff the Tv &amp; hug my kids, this is getting beyond crazy #helpusJesus

@JosephHeckert  it was out of respect for the other few that politely asked me to remove it,
@JosephHeckert well not a lot of people felt the way u did about those post &amp; it wasn't bc of u that I took it down,
