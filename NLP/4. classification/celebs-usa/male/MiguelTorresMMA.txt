Wisdom comes from understanding the key to true happiness is in the act of doing, expecting anything else in return other than doing the right thing is just a form of self absorption and self-fulfilling prophecy in the end leaving you sitting their in a state of cynicism.
No matter what you sacrifice or do to help bring someone up they will always tend to forget in the end leaving you right back at square one.

That awkward moment when you get to the club &amp; didn't bring an id. But you have a sherdog profile verify your age.

@BUDLOFSKY Batman doesn't have to kill Wolverine to let him know he is better than him.
@thugjitsumaster did I mention that Batman is banging most of the female Super Heroes?
@BUDLOFSKY dude, what are you talking about cage matches for? You can't put those guys in a cage, a hypothetical fight has no boundaries.
@BUDLOFSKY @thugjitsumaster Batman would figure out Wolverines main weakness, which is his over aggressiveness & exploit him.
@thugjitsumaster man I like Wolverine too, smart ass who fights everyone. Batman would outsmart him though. Strategy over power all day.
