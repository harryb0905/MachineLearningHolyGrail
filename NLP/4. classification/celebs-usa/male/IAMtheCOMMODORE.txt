@iiNiccole you will, I swear. It's been a tough couple of years. I'll write you and tell you more.
@sarinnne you're not, don't worry. I'm not even old. "Old" is a state of mind.
The nostalgia I've felt today is thick, palpable. I don't even know how to handle it.
@sarinnne right?! That's life. You blink and 10 years have passed. Such a wild feeling.

@lisamariex0x0 I'm in Saratoga...a few hours east of you :)
Now I'm laying in bed in the same room I grew up in. It's mostly the same, filled with all my childhood stuff, like a time capsule.
@danielleyoung__ @KariLeeBosen It's crazy, right? That feeling only gets stronger and deeper as you get older. (It's a good thing)
@KaylaIsAllNow life is good. Challenging, but good. How are you??
@rosehawkins_ the best. THE BEST!!
@KaylaIsAllNow hi Kayla!
@KariLeeBosen I'm about to turn 36. Life is weird.
I stepped into my childhood bedroom tonight and the feeling of comfort and security was so overwhelming, I nearly started weeping.
@KariLeeBosen we've been in LA for exactly 7 years and 6 days! Hard to believe...
My parents live in the same house I grew up in. So when I go home to visit, it's really HOME. Hashtag blessed.

Deep breaths... I got this.
I'm going to start by finishing my letters to many of you...at least I have lots to write about :)
I never meant to abandon you. I never meant to let you down. I want to find a way to make it up to all of you, but I don't know how.
But I'm getting better, things are looking up. I still have lots to look forward to. And I have all of you to thank for some amazing moments
You all know me pretty fucking well...I'm generally a very happy person. But it's been hard for me to be happy since the band split.
...I've spent the past 18 months struggling with that. It's been a STRUGGLE. In a lot of ways, I feel like my life has been on pause...
@sarinnne :)
...and I felt like I had nothing to be proud of. That's a horrible feeling...it made me crawl into a shell for a while.
...maybe I felt ashamed...depressed...that the thing I was most proud of went away...
I think I stopped tweeting &amp; communicating with the outside world because I was bumming about HS and had nothing exciting to share...
@danielleyoung__ hokay!!
