Just before his SOTU address, @realDonaldTrump had a 40% approval rating. At this stage in his presidency, Ronald Reagan had 35% approval but within 2 years was easily re-elected winning 49 states &amp; 525 Electoral votes. George H.W. Bush was at 83% but then lost to Bill Clinton. https://t.co/PzQ2e6EVOl

After US intelligence chiefs disagreed w/ @realDonaldTrump on national security issues, he tweeted today perhaps they ‚Äúshould go back to school.‚Äù In 2015, he said: ‚ÄúI know more about ISIS than the generals. Believe me.‚Äù He's also said: ‚ÄúI know more about technology than anybody.‚Äù
Watch what @realDonaldTrump has been saying about major national security threats facing the U.S. and what his top intelligence chiefs told the Senate today: https://t.co/JxaUqIEa2c
As @SpeakerPelosi decides when to invite @realDonaldTrump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress, it‚Äôs worth recalling this one line in the Constitution. https://t.co/8EDxqyZDJM

Roger Stone and @realDonaldTrump have a long history. Check out my exchange on @CNN with Trump in 2004 when we discussed whether he should run for President. He called Stone "a friend" and "a good guy" who looked into the possibility for him. https://t.co/GgcKsubmh1

Given the news that @realDonaldTrump discussed pulling the U.S. from NATO, I checked the @CNN archives. Back on March 21, 2016, I asked him whether the U.S. needs to rethink its involvement in NATO. He said yes. And then, on April 4, 2016, he referred to our exchange. Watch: https://t.co/1O6jmKTeWl
On Saturday, @realDonaldTrump tweeted: ‚ÄúElections have consequences.‚Äù He‚Äôs right. His election has had enormous consequences. Now, w/ Dems winning 40 House seats &amp; the majority, getting subpoena power &amp; electing @SpeakerPelosi that election also will have enormous consequences. https://t.co/baNdLooPFr

At a Republican presidential debate in 2016, I asked @realDonaldTrump: "If you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?" Here's his response: https://t.co/i7dQea8Ehi

We know Special Counsel Mueller has been investigating the 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Paul Manafort attended the meeting. Now, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya has been charged by the feds w/ obstruction of justice in an unrelated money-laundering case. She was also there. https://t.co/afR7Er2ALE
Paul Manafort‚Äôs lawyers say his solitary confinement has impacted his physical &amp; mental health. He suffers from ‚Äúsevere gout, at times confining him to a wheelchair,‚Äù depression &amp; anxiety, and, due to the jail‚Äôs visitation regulations, has had ‚Äúvery little contact w/ his family.‚Äù https://t.co/0wVoWREbKV

The U.S. Labor Department reports 312,000 jobs were added in December. In total, 2,600,000 were added for all of 2018. Since President Trump took office nearly two years ago, roughly 4,800,000 new jobs were added to the U.S. economy.
The U.S. Treasury Department says that the national debt has increased by $2 trillion ($2,000,000,000,000) since President Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017. That's with Republicans in control of the House and Senate. The national debt is now almost $22 trillion.
