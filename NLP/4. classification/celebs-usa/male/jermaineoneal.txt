@clev_45 what makes you feel comfortable even coming out your mouth like this. If I was your teammate it would be a serious problem on site!
Message to the media:Your Pin and Tv Coverage is a powerful thing so use your platform to educate and not just for rating or news paper sale
It's time to start talking about it and addressing this issue head on so that "Everyone" can be better educated about everyone feelings/view
United States of America üá∫üá∏ racism isn't in the closet anymore and it's staring us directly in the faces of all races!
As a black man it really F**ken upsets me to see this but hate creates more hate which puts everyone in a even darker place.
We need our leaders to lead across the board!  No one should be afraid of being killed or racially profiled because of there skin color.
Then they will turn around and teach there youth to do the same. It's time to set a standard to life to help people to success
But I do know that hate isn't born in you it's taught to you! So all the communities need to take a stand and "teach" our youth to love
Or is the law and our constitution written for a certain race or class of peopleü§î? I'm not even sure anymore how to feel about these issues
At what point do people understand that times have changed and we all are "EQUAL" as American citizens.
I'm not sure what to tell my kids or kids in the communities about the issue that is continually happing in our country because of race.
Man I've been struggling all day trying to figure out where this country is going. I feel a little lost as parent and community leader.

Steph will dominate you smiling and Reggie would dominate you, bite your head off and let you know about it. https://t.co/Syh8CiKI44
They are 2 different players but both are the greatest shooters that this world has ever seen!  https://t.co/Syh8CiKI44
I can't argue you on that point.  https://t.co/ULmxummKOh
Yeah that was probably the most physical era. You can never go wrong with any era that had Jordan highlighting it https://t.co/DMzyhXhV2R
Yeah that was a dope, deep, and talented area... https://t.co/fVBlc9MzGN
Just for a fun conversation, As fans what era do you like the best?
Let's just sit back and enjoy watching these guys go after something that only one team has ever been able to do in any era! Good luck dubs!
We are watching the greatest shooter "ever" and possibly one of the greatest teams of all time!
But to discredit what Steph is doing individually and what the Warriors are doing as a team is absolutely crazy!
Yes the eras are different, yes the game isn't as physical anymore, yes the level of overall competitive nature of teams are different.
I can't believe that every day I turn on the tv people are talking about or trying to pick apart what Steph and the warriors are doing.

We got to do better! Yes we want justice,  but by no means should we cause injustice to hard working families and there lives.
How do you we call this supporting a cause by destroying people in your same communities lives and livelihoods!
So I'm confused on why people think this is ok to do and cause so much heart ache and pain to families that may never recover from this.
I get even angrier when I see people of the same color as me go and Destroy homes and businesses in areas that people of the same color live

Great day today with the fam! Truly life long memories... http://t.co/wZUpHTE4Ce
I will say this, if the decision is to play I promise you that when I hit the court I will be ready physically and mentally to help a team!
But I love my family more than I love life itself and they will have the final say on my playing career or the closing of my bball career!
I've been blessed to have the opportunity to play for some great coaches, organizations, and cites and I will always have love for them!
My decision will not be based off any personal relationships with a cityor organization which will be tuff because Ofthe love I got for them
Can I physically still play?Probably better than 60% of the bigs in the league today! That's not a knock on anyone but more about how I feel
Do I still love the game of basketball? Yes without a doubt!
So you can believe now whatever decision I make will be a pure family decision that my family will have a huge part on making with me.
For 18 long years sports has dominated my families life to a point that they have had to sacrifice things that was important to them.
So I know it's been some talk about if I will play again or not and if so then what team will I choose. So I thought I would speak on this.

Man it feels strange to be watching nba games as a fan now after playing and being involved in it for the last 18years! Wow!!!!!!!

I want to congratulate my teammates and @MarkJackson13 and his staff for a outstanding season! I'm really proud of you guys!
Man it really doesn't set in that the season is really over until days like this when you have to clean your locker out and say goodbye üò©

I also want to thank every fan in that arena for showing me so much love tonight! It was for sure heart Felt and I will always love you guys
But I must say it was good being back home and seeing a lot of familiar faces! It was also great to see the field house loud and crazy again
Big win against a very tough pacers team tonight! Im proud of my guys! But It's a must win for us tomorrow to end this trip the right way!
But I will be ready to help my team try and get a tuff win against one of the leagues best on Tuesday! (Bottle the anger and release it tue!
To help them battle for a win during a very important part of our season! Words just can not explain how I feel right now.
And believe me when I tell you that there isn't a person in the country more upset than me about not being able to be with my team tonight
As a leader, businessman, and father, I pride myself off being responsible, professional, and prompt! I did not leave or lose my passport!!!
So tonight I will play and hopefully the rhythm won't take long to come back....
8 weeks ago I was told that I would probably be out for 4months after my surgery, but with a lot of hard work and a lot of prayers I'm back!
Sometimes life presents challenges that seems to be to great to overcome but with god by your side anything and everything is possible!
@LetsGoWarriors to clarify, I said that I thought that Seattle would win in there building because of the crowd noise! But I am a cowboysfan
‚Äú@PrayInFaith: God sees your pain. He will supply an opportunity. He will provide a way. Bigger and greater than before!‚Äù

"@E_Boy88: @jermaineoneal if.its.not true why you sp thirsTy to prove to us its not true. just let it be." You don't want to know the truth?

But coach hunter is our coach now and we fully support him!
Coach gentry will be missed but its also apart of the business in sports! We all had hands in on the 13-28 start not just the coach!
Lindsey hunter is now our coach and we will do anything and everything to support him and try to turn this season around!
Altercation? False! Argument about a coaching change or coaching hire? Even more false! That's is not my position or job to determine that!
People should be ashamed of there selves for reporting things to the public that are absolutely not true!  smdh!

@claudiajordan
"@desoto103: @jermaineoneal I'm taking classes to become a teacher"very nice and congrats to you!
Ok enough debate on that! What's on everyone's agenda for today!
@SMosley21 thank you and I appreciate the work that you have done for our country.
@sergienko22 you might want to read your bio again and you will understand what  I'm saying bro!
@linkdepaula right to correct mismanagement of money.
A lot of opinions about that subject and I appreciate the responses! Its always good to get a different prospective from other people!
@sergienko22 so my question to you is why have our 4+ years of college CEO of banks failed at managing money? bailoutplan from government!
@TonyJohnIII so let the teams make the best judgment just like any other institution in the business world.
@Jayboats it was no disrespect to the soldiers that gives us a opportunity to live a free life brother!  For sure no confusion there!
@Jayboats the comparison between soldiers and sports was just having the choice to decide what you want to do at18 out of highschool! Choice
@sergienko22 our country is struggling from mismanagement of money from the most powerful institutions in our country.So its not justplayers
"@sergienko22: @jermaineoneal how many players become bankrupt once they leave the league ?"Have you look at the ratio in america in general
@WarrenSapp the age limit in basketball.
@DrRobert3 but why aren't they train for 4 years for it! Basketball is just for entertainment. Its all about having a choice!
@DrRobert3 I agree and serving your country is a very serious thing and I salute each and every man and woman for it!
@linkdepaula and just to be clear I'm not by any means saying that its not a good idea to go to college! I'm just saying having a choice is
@linkdepaula ok again, why is it some of the countries most succesful people either never went or dropped out of college?
"@andrewwallock8: @jermaineoneal It's a whole different thing, bro. NBA is not the military."Right, but its about having a choice!
Ok so why is it ok to go over seas at 18to fire a gun in a war to earn a living and it isn't ok to choose to play basketball coming out ofHS
@Ken_Marks_Esq or because this is twitter and you only get a limited amount of characters to get your statement out! Or did you forget!
"@mcfoleysauce: @jermaineoneal because they turn into immature washouts like you."Let me guess, you are a very unhappy person in life!
@WarrenSapp what are your thoughts on this?
"@Megusta_MD: @jermaineoneal @basketballtalk No one is stopping them from playing overseas professionally"I agree as well.
@bpore again why can't you educate yourself and do something that you have dreamed about doing all your life? Is that not possible to you?
"@HakonBjarka: @bpore @jermaineoneal Its more important to make a living then be educated!" Why can't You do both at once? I'm confused!
"@GigiShiree: @jermaineoneal just like anything else, its what one makes of it. hardwork and dedication never go unnoticed."Totally agree!
@DericRoberts if he wins does he not earn any money during the event or have endorsements?
@_TheChief or you clearly don't understand what life is all about! Don't confuse your way of life with everyone's way and approach to life!
@bpore huh? What do you do to take care of your family?

"@J_Smoooth87: @jermaineoneal because golf isn't a contact sport...you don't have to worry about Tiger Woods trying to post you up" huh?
"@BrianPatrick03: @jermaineoneal no one drops out of school to play golf..."Doesn't matter they are still pro and making a living!
Our constitution states that we all have the right to choose and make a way of living! That's the true value of our country!
@CMcnificent is it fair that colleges can make millions off of kids and they can choose to make a living for there selves?
@JO7FAN bro going to college doesn't mean that you will be prepared for the nba! Its nothing like learning on the job in any work place!
I wonder why its ok for a 14 year old to play pro golf but a basketball player has to be 2 years removed from high school!

Well thanks everyone for the feed back on what I missed in the sports world. Gave me and my brother something to discuss over dinner.
"@DiegoSwish13: @jermaineoneal YES. bob arum..before the decision, bradley told arum he was sorry..but just couldn't beat pacquiao.."Crazy!
Did both fighters have the same management team?
"@deion423: @jermaineoneal hell yea steavie wonder could have judge that fight"hahahahahah damn that bad?
Now those judges just killied the pacman vs mayweather fight! No one wants to see a fight that they think maybe rigged!
Boxing is like WWF now! They Predetermine who is going to win because the sport is dyeing! UFC is much better to watch. At least its real!
"@TKSmoove: @jermaineoneal he landed 34 percent of his hits. Timmy landed 18 percent. Even Tim admitted he lost. Judges ruled Tim." Crazy!
I'm hearing the fight was rigged! Did the pacman get cheated?
I was a tuff day in the sports world for me. I get off the plane and I see that The celtics lost and pacman lost. What the hell!
"@goddesspeachy: @jermaineoneal i know u got Celtics for tonight, how about Pacquiao-Bradley?"I got pacquiao for sure!

"@Chris_Pehrson: @jermaineoneal JO ever think about bringing the corn-rolls back?"But know I'm past the phase in my life bro!
"@Chris_Pehrson: @jermaineoneal JO ever think about bringing the corn-rolls back?"Hahahah me and my brother was just joking about that today

It will be tough, but I will beat the odds and you will see it all! I'm starting a you tube page so everyone can see it!

"@BugraOvacik: @jermaineoneal you should bring back your tough inside moves my man! that ones make you J.O. #7 real sharp moves" I agree!
Step 2: train as hard as I have ever trained in my life! Really challenge the body!
"@avery22oliver: @jermaineoneal getting the Kobe Arod surgery??" Yes I am getting the same treatment
The first step starts in a couple of hours when I board a plane to dusseldorf Germany for a week of treatment with dr peter wehling!
"@BenRavey: @jermaineoneal Dude you not retired doe? Say it ain't so!!"No sir!
I have a 3 step process for this summer to see if I can get myself back to a level that "I'm" happy with and that could help a team win!
"@poloswagg2: @jermaineoneal wish you still played for the Green and the White #CelticNation misses you" thanks a lot and I miss playing!
@BugraOvacik I'm not sure my brother. I'm concentrating on getting the body right and the testing it to see how hard I can challenge it.
Wishing the green and white luck tonight down in miami! I wish I was able to see the game tonight but I'm sure the out come will be great!
@HalaFishHeat one person can speak for a entire city! That was a dumb ass that threw the drink but that one person doesn't rep a entire city
Its a lot of great fan bases in the nba, but celtics fans showed a lot of class and that chant will energize the guys for game 7!
"How are you going to know where I'm at, if you aint been where I've been, you understand where I'm coming from" #thought of the day#

"@jchatelle: @jermaineoneal rose has been recovering the whole season. Dude only played half the games"yes but he never had enough prac time
@Ericb1980 that's not true bro. When bodies are tired and not enough time to recover then your body tends to break down! That's fact!
To many games in not enough recovery days!
Today was a clear sign of fatigue bodies from a short condense hard season! 2 torn acl injuries to key players!

But it looks like its going to be a lot of action in this game tho. #high scoring game#
@KaylaKorte I'm not sure about that! Kansas have size also!
I'm not sure if kentucky can play in a close game because they are so use to blowing people out.
I got kansas winning it all by 5pts!

"@abstractness: @jermaineoneal support your boys, let the haters hate!!!" That's for sure!
"@glenng4433: @jermaineoneal @whyhate"how is that hate? Am I not allowed to say that my boy is doing good in a game? Stop being sensitive
My boy d wright is doing his thing tonight against the heat!
"@clearazglass: @jermaineoneal Mannn, get out dat store.. LOL!! NO FRIES!!"Why can't a brother have some fries?
"@magicfan2301: @jermaineoneal You had to go shopping? You picked the wrong day to lay the cook off! lol" yeah considering its 25 degrees
But I can tell yall whatever I'm going to eat is going to have to go with this! my favorite! http://yfrog.com/h0f4cbj
As yall can see I've got some decisions to make! Hummmmmm http://yfrog.com/h2b1bjj
"@Courtdilla: @jermaineoneal top ramen.. If u fuck up that then idk what to tell u.." From the words of my boy KG "Anything is POSSIBLLLLLLE
"@13am13i: @jermaineoneal Ok .. Peanut butter and Jelly sandwich with chips and a soda on the side .... LOL !!!"I like that for a snack
"@fiestyliz32: @jermaineoneal anything that won't burn the house down or make you wake up with a bad stomach lol" yeah that's a great idea
Hold up yall! I'm not a 5 star chef! Some of yall getting a lil to fancy for the kid! Let's stay with the basics!
Im about to try and cook something for dinner  because I gave chef nigel the day off. So what do yall think I should whip up?
"@hollywood_k: @jermaineoneal u should just do your shopping online :)" Im already on it!
"@AllisonCeglio: @jermaineoneal (uneventful) what a word! Lol only u" what you never heard that word before?
@Cassius_King_Jr yeah I thought the same thing
Just got done looking at "the tourist" and I really didn't like it. It was to slow and very uneventful!
Just finished a great day of workouts and now I'm about to check out the new movie "The tourist"! I hope that its as good as the previews!
@THATGIRLME that's not a bad thing as long as you get something! Better late than never!
Have yall started christmas shopping yet? I haven't gotten one gift yet! But I am a great last minute shopper......
@JO7FAN its doing good! Some days are better than others.
Damn today feels like "ground hog day"! Today has been ruff!
@nate_robinson l$$$$$
@mike_stjean what's your full name bro!
@BoricuasFinest7 well I got 2 tickets for you tonight if you want to check the game out.

@BoricuasFinest7 thanks bro! Where do you live?
"@bostongirl_a: @jermaineoneal Me too, big game tonight!! How is your knee doing?"its doing a lot better!
"@Dupes4life: @jermaineoneal Any tickets for tonights game?"I do if you are in boston
On my way to the arena and I hope that my boys can get number 8 in a row tonight!
"@Mizz_Modesty: @jermaineoneal Whether it's good, bad, or indifferent. I support my Cowboys all day...every day.  #GoCowboys"
This pats/jets game reminds me a lot of the cavs/heat game: "a lot of hype but ending up to being a early blowout"!
"@Agreezy84: @jermaineoneal how you feel bout the coaching change??"I wish they would have did that earlier in the season!
I support the pats because I live in boston now but I'm a true cowboys fan!
Just getting home from the gym, so I guess now I'm going to check out monday night football. Who do yall got in this one?
7 DAYS until @iamdiddy's "Last Train To Paris" drops! Check out the prelude: http://diddy.it/hzaS4Y"
By the way I will have a better answer for everyone who keeps asking when I'm going to return to playing on saturday or sunday.
About to stop to the crib to grab a quick bite to eat then I'm headed back to the gym for my second workout of the day!
God bless all of those kids and there families!
It puts things in perspective on what's really important in your life and what really isn't when you see so many kids fighting for the lives
Just leaving the childrens hospital and I had a blast with the kids and there families! Shouts out to the celtics for putting that together!
Good morning everyone!
@Marquis_Daniels bro i rep columbia s.c! That means the metro, eau claire high school, and the university of s.c!

"@billydaps: Yesterday was one of the best days of my life, winning tickets from @jermaineoneal was so awesome, thanks again man" no problem
@claudiajordan you need your own show for real!
Man it looks like cleveland is laying allllllllllll the way down!
Yeah this game is over!
The first five minutes of this quarter is going to tell you the out come of this game!
Its starting to look like cleveland doesn't have enough fire power or "D"!
@claudiajordan you are funny!
"@claudiajordan: Cleveland missing more shots than a sick dog in the hood . You know they NEVER get taken to the Vet!" @classicquote :)
"@NYJE57: @jermaineoneal do you think the amount of hate is justified?" Fans live through sports,  sometimes that tends to make them thatway
Seeing all the signs and hearing all the boos has to be hard for lebron after so many years of being there!
I'm waiting to see if he is going to do the powder!
I think that this game won't be close either way for the cavs or heat! Someone is going to get blown out! I think its to much emotion in it!
@Thoroughbred215 lol
Do yall think that lebron will throw the chalk in the air tonight in front of the cleveland crowd?
@leomvp96 what's up bro!
@Legs_for_days did you do all of that today already?
I guess I will do the same as most of yall and check the game out tonight!
Is everyone watching the heat/cavs game! Wow!
Damn
What's on everyone's agenda today?
"@Lizzs_Lockeroom: @jermaineoneal Thank you! People don't get that concept.. Love, Kindess and time is a way to give back"
And by the way, it doesn't take money to be a impact in some ones life. It just takes a little bit of your time and effort!
I would encourage everyone to help someone during the holidays! You may not be able to help everyone but you can help impact @onepersonslife
"The key in life is to change the world and be a influence on the world one person at a time"!
All you have to do is go to j7ofoundation@gmail.com and tell us your story and why your family should be selected!
We will also purchase food for the families so that they can have a christmas dinner to go with the toys!
By the way on behalf of me and my family, we are looking for 4 families in the boston area with at least 2 kids to give gifts for christmas!
Doing nice things for people helps take your mind off of problems that you have going on in your life!
@producepat ok you can pick the tickets up at "will call" at the box office! Enjoy!
@producepat what's your full name?

"@BugraOvacik: @jermaineoneal 10 rebounds, 10 blocks, 18 points. vs. toronto. You are correct! Do you live in boston?
Ok here is the 2nd question for the final 2 tickets to the game tonight. What were the numbers to my last triple double?
I have 2 more tickets to give away but I just got in the car to go home from the gym, so I will have the last question of the day in 10mins.
"@billydaps: @jermaineoneal William Dapkus I cannot thank you enough" no problem! Enjoy!
@billydaps send me your full name and 2 tickets will be at will call under your name.

@billydaps would you be able to make the game?
@J8Lacy do you live in boston?
@billydaps do you live in boston?
Here is the first question: what's the most points I've scored in a nba game?
The first correct answer that I see will get the tickets.
Well since I'm new to the city of boston, I'm going to test just how much you know about me to get the tickets.
Well since I'm new to  th city of boston, I'm going to test just how much you know about me to get the tickets.

"@projectzeroent: @jermaineoneal depends on the situation..... but probably....BALLER!!  #chumpchange" it was punches thrown!
Do yall think that if 2 basketball players would have been involved in a fight like johnson/finnegan? Would we have just been fined 25k?
@PrimeObjective just getting home from working out and about to watch the "Cs" get a win in cleveland tonight. What's up with you bro?
"@magicfan2301: @jermaineoneal change numbers every 3 years." That could help!

@joumanakidd yeah i i heard that st tropez was very nice and i think thats the place im going to try to get to.
@prtygrlgonebad are you ok? Do you need a hug or something? Why so angry?
@HeadHeartbreakr I dont believe that!
But the funny thing is do the women really think that they can live without men in there lives even if they are a liar?
So is that why alot of people dont want to be in relationships anymore because of the lack of trust between the 2?
@ckstrategies lol
Its funny to see alot of the ladies comments and how hard they are on guys. Do some of yall, if not all of yall not lie to your mates?
So now i see that this has turn into the male bashing session! :) So why ask a guy for the truth if most of yall cant handle it?
@Vspikes Im doing good. Just sitting on the couch watching chef nigel and bonzi wells play madden.
I got a question for the ladies. Why do alot of women tend to want to accept a lie from a guy than the honest truth?
@Fligirl0026 how is cali?
Whats good twitter fam!
Just got home from a great workout but im sad because my family left todAY! :(
Goodmorning twitter fam! About to kick this day off with a great breakfast and a nice hard workout!
Well yall im about to lay down and watch sponge bob with my son because he leaves tomorrow, so i will get with yall in the am! Goodnight fam
@LilBabyCakes916 Well thank you! :)
Before i forget "SHOUTS OUT TO @kalikwest" for the page! Good lookin my brother!
@MsDanaLee Isnt that the truth....
@KlassikBREEZY dm me..
@Birdking187 naw he didnt, somebody else brought it to my attention and i wanted to talk about it..
I wish alot of people could think the way yall think because this place we call home would be alot better! Yall responses are on point!
But to be honest do we really give damn if somebody is hating on us? I for sure dont because it doesnt change my life AT ALL! I LOVE IT!
For example i want yall to take a look at this page @hateraid. This is crazy! What the hell is wrong with people!
@nativeinktattoo Well thats not cool..
@From_The_Chi You are right and people have the right to not like something. But how far does a person take it?
But the biggest question is why not help the next person instead of trying to pull them down! Is helping somebody else really that hard?
So i guess it takes alot of practice to develop that B$TCHA$$NESS?
Ok so some are born with it, some are some lazy F$%KERS, some have F#$ked up lives and some are mad at what somebody else has! Ok i see now.
I got a question for yall because ive been trying to figure this one out. How does a hater become a hater? Are they born with that disease?
@CARAMELDREAM69 lol yeah i know...
@MzNat85 so you was thinking the same thing then!
@Eb_the_Celeb honest
@TeeArnee Thats good money! Thank you!
@ckstrategies I like that answer! :)
@brittanydailey Yeah you would want me to look like a ass! :)
@ocean_green Yo just dm me so i can give you that information.
Wait a damn minute now, i dont know how to feel about alot of yall liking the new look. So how the hell did yall think i look with braids?
@projectzeroent Hahahahahaha yo thats funny!
@ckstrategies Got to have that right! :)
@brittanydailey Yo thats the worst too! You have to go through the ruff stage where you dont want to leave the house because of how it looks
@B_ran_Dee Why was it a smart move?
@misscheriee Yeah but i still get that question everyday...
@tiffbryant22 awwww thank you!
@bhedington Naw he cut them off last year...
@jenshipley @mylalove09 IM GLAD TO SEE THAT YALL FEEL THE SAME WAY! :)
You cant have braids at 30 or older trying to go to business meetings and expect people to take you seriously PERIOD!
Im going to answer the braids question that i seem to get everytime i get on here, "It is a 0% chance that i grow my hair back"!
@catwalkkc Yeah she has grown up!  Time flies!
@catwalkkc How are you?
@abcsamir Im just resting up from a crazy long day at the gym! mondays are always the hardest from the 2day break from the weekend!
