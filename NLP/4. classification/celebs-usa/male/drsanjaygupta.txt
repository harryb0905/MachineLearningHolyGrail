@dragonpepper others have said they would take temp 2x/day for 21 days -- and if over 101.5, seek care, isolate and test
@JATetro thanks! I needed that. Unless you are actually mocking my tie? I wouldn't know either way. I am not a big tie guy or suit guy.
@dragonpepper it has been tough to get answers to some basic questions.
@dqdebra not sure why that is -- but, I will keep asking.
@bowen1953 @wrongt @nymedabc @DrOz @MarisaGuthrie thanks for that. I miss that show too. No question, though, @wrongt is brilliant.

depends where she lives. RT @SethSchneids1m @drsanjaygupta friend has a 7 year old like Charlotte w/ 100s of seizures daily. Where to start?
these patients were taking marijuana as an oil or vaporized. I found many medical marijuana patients don't smoke. #Weed

absolutely true. RT @DrVinayChopra2m @drsanjaygupta don't discount that weed can impair your senses and make driving deadly #Weed
these are some amazing scientists. very tough for them to get federal funding for their research, but they persist. #Weed

@GiavannaAlexa23 hey there! thanks for watching. Giving you, AJ and your mom a big wave! #BigHits
@bennyearl @Fortunejn we spent a fair amount of time with #SportsLegacyInstitute. Featured in the documentary. #BigHits
Can watch again at 11p est #BigHits #CNN
I love watching the JH Rose Rampants win this game. Homecoming. They played safe... and, they won! #BigHits
@jkirby @DowJokesReport that is insane... why would they do that? #BigHits
Artificial turf more likely to cause concussions than natural grass. Artificial turf also tended to cause more severe concussions. #BigHits
@jkirby it is a worthy debate. Should high schools have football programs if they cannot do everything proven to keep kids safe? #BigHits
@BiggieSwoles very true. and, bad habits can start at the Pop Warner level as well, such as leading with the head. #BigHits
Girls more likely to report symptoms of fatigue and sensitivity to noise. Boys more likely to report amnesia and confusion. #BigHits
@mb00gie ha! thanks.
@appelATC thanks for watching. We want everyone to have access to this. Will make it available at http://t.co/jXLzSAg9 -- tomorrow. #BigHits
An unbelievable and selfless act by the parents of Nathan Stiles. Ron and Connie Stiles. Thank you for sharing your story. #BigHits
For people between the ages of 15-24, sports are the second leading cause for traumatic brain injury, behind car accidents. #BigHits
@KatieRdATC yes, i was stunned to learn that. When they say Big Hits, they mean it. Up to 150 G's of force. #BigHits
@Frank_Ten if there is a doubt as to whether a player is healed from a concussion -- the test should be repeated. #BigHits
Kevin Guskiewicz won the MacArthur Genius Grant for his work on concussions. Listen to his solutions. Next #BigHits #CNN
@jkirby  now there are objective cognitive tests that can be taken at beginning of season. get a baseline, and then compare. #BigHits
Athletic trainers have a tough job. Sometimes they have to take a player's helmet to keep them off the field. #BigHits
@JordanSalley as i investigated this -- i realized so many of the concussions occur during practice. perhaps, fewer drills and head hits.
the average high school football player takes 650 hits to the brain every season! many of them like being in a minor car accident. #BigHits
@DrDavidGeier new research show girls more prone to concussions. girl soccer players 68% more likely as compared to boy soccer players.
@CRS19  helmets alone can't solve the problem. in a few minutes, you will see what happens to the brain during a concussion.
@MagnaReady absolutely. shortly, we will take you to boston to look at the issue of cumulative hits. brand new science. #BigHits
@kwellum it is a rough game, but there are simple strategies to play safer, and still have football be... football. #BigHits
@giffordgraphics @DrDavidGeier @daniellecnn glad you stood your ground. And, I am sure the players will thank you as well.
Terms like "Bell Rung" serves to minimize the problem. As we are about to show you: concussions are brain injuries. #BigHits
@eoin1mccarthy defensive backs, offensive lineman and linebackers:most likely to get a concussion. no position, however, is immune. #BigHits
@jkirby there are solutions that can reduce the most catastrophic consequences. For starters, athletic trainers at all practices/games.
@Fortunejn CTE can show up later in life. It is the result of cumulative hits to the brain, and can look like alzheimer's dz.
@Jodaay009 that was our point. There was no athletic trainer -- instead, only someone who was trained in first aid, not concussion diagnosis
Keep an eye on player Grey Dixon #34. His story is a case study in how concussions should be handled. #BigHits #CNN now

about to hear from dr lemole, the neurosurgeon on call at university medical center. he had a critical decision to make. #cnntv
the medics, nurses and docs have an eye on the clock. the golden hour has started for Giffords. #cnntv
@nonious yes, you will notice: these medics did not place breathing tube while in the field. #cnntv. Giffords was protecting her airway.
@DeAnnSmithkc great question regarding princess di. I don't know, but remember the ambulance stayed on scene in france for a long time.
trauma protocol is ABC -- airway, breathing, circulation. that's what the medics are focused on. #cnntv
in the US, trauma care focuses on a scoop/run philosophy. pick up patient and get to hospital asap. #cnntv
these medics who care for giffords are so compassionate. emt's don't always get the recognition they deserve. #cnntv
