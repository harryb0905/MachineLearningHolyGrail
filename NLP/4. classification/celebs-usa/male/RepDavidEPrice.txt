President Trump's national ‚Äúemergency‚Äù circumvents the will of Congress and the American people to build an unnecessary wall he promised Mexico would pay for. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm an original cosponsor of @JoaquinCastroTX's resolution to terminate it.

Nothing says national emergency like a weekend of golf in Mar-A-Lago. https://t.co/0srtRBEGMr
Not only is there no national emergency at the border: crossings remain at historically low levels. My full statement: https://t.co/oebNIAQBUZ
Since neither Mexico nor Congress will pay for his ridiculous 2,000-mile border wall campaign promise, Trump has set a dangerous precedent by declaring a phony ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù that circumvents the will of Congress and the American people.

While @realDonaldTrump once again chose fear and division as his preferred path, @HouseDemocrats will continue to advance an agenda that moves our nation forward in a united way. #SOTU
With only 10 days before the government runs out of funding once again, we heard nothing from the President on how to avoid another #TrumpShutdown. Democrats are ready to fund smart, effective solutions for border security. The President is only ready to play games.
In tonight‚Äôs #SOTU we heard a hollow pledge for unity, followed by lies and division designed to manufacture a political crisis. The President‚Äôs scripted remarks mean nothing if they are followed by a discriminatory agenda that undermines our values &amp; further divides our nation.
FACT CHECK: false. https://t.co/vhrmiawwLd
I‚Äôm proud to be joined at tonight‚Äôs #SOTU by Ken Krebs‚Äîa federal employee in my district who was furloughed thanks to the #TrumpShutdown. Ken hopes to hear the President‚Äôs plan to avoid shutting down the government again. https://t.co/nsVU9MzIWe

Dr. Everett Ward, who has led @SAU_News since 2014, has announced that he will retire this summer. I know I join thousands in the Raleigh &amp; St. Augustine‚Äôs community in thanking him for his selfless service and wishing him well in his future endeavors. https://t.co/sBHZO3qmrg
In the coming weeks, Democrats will work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass already-negotiated appropriations bills for Transportation, HUD, and other federal depts., protect our borders with smart &amp; effective solutions, and uphold our shared values as Americans.
I‚Äôm pleased that President Trump has, for now, decided to end his tantrum and sign legislation to temporarily reopen government while negotiations continue on border security issues.
Trump‚Äôs shutdown of the federal government has been one of the most irresponsible chapters in American political history. His reckless demand that Congress pay ransom for his foolish border wall left 700K federal workers without pay &amp; millions more without services they rely on.
Emerging reports that flights are delayed into NY area due to @FAA staffing issues is only the beginning if #TrumpShutdown continues.  Our dedicated air traffic controllers need to get paid, and President Trump needs to stop holding the nation hostage.
Voters sent a clear message in 2018: Do not take away our health care. Health care was a defining issue in the midterms, and Congress must work to #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/c3W7NbQVTg
The average federal employee takes home $500 a week and can't afford to miss a paycheck. You don't understand why they can't afford food? Because your boss shut down the government and is holding federal worker's paychecks hostage. https://t.co/JuDTdinlla
It's been two years since President Trump reinstated &amp; radically expanded the harmful #GlobalGagRule. This rule restricts reproductive rights, undermines global health, and sabotages local efforts to save lives. https://t.co/WvCQSgpElo
Regardless of what @realDonaldTrump says, Democrats support measures to improve border security. Here's what's in our latest package to reopen the government:  -$524.2M to upgrade our ports of entry  -$563.4M for immigration judges  -$527M for assistance to Central America
The only "compromise" in President Trump's proposal was a compromise of our national values. When you water down protections for Dreamers and refugees and eviscerate the asylum process you can't say you're negotiating in "good faith." https://t.co/NSvK8fop21

While the government shutdown is certainly Donald Trump's fault, 800,000 federal employees remain unpaid because of @senatemajldr's spineless refusal to put funding bills on the floor that would assuredly pass in the Senate.

8. To make matters worse, as Trump slams the door on asylum seekers, he has proposed to gut aid to the very countries from which migrants are seeking refuge, further exacerbating the crisis. https://t.co/xLOkMp0U6Q
7: The Trump administration has claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists have been prevented from entering U.S....FACT: @CBP encountered only SIX at ports of entry along US-Mexico border--that's 35 less than total apprehensions on the US-CANADA border. https://t.co/R6yjyjSFcf
6: Also, states with higher populations of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller undocumented populations. https://t.co/2ZisCUIOXR
5: The Trump administration's entire immigration platform is predicated on the idea that immigrants commit crimes. FACT: undocumented immigrants are far less likely to commit crime than native-born citizens. https://t.co/2vndz1a9Wz
4: The number of illegal border crossings is less than half of the number of individuals traveling by plane or boat who overstayed their visa in 2017. Additionally, the number of visa overstays declined from 2016 to 2017.
3: In fact, since the end of the Great Recession, more Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico from the U.S. than have migrated here. The total number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico has declined by more than 1 million since 2007. https://t.co/B8mMPrNB6a
2: While the number of illegal border crossings ticked up slightly in 2018, overall they have declined by MORE THAN 75% since peaking in the year 2000.
1: Despite what the President says, arrests in 2017 for undocumented border crossings were at a *46-year* low. For reference, the last time border crossings were this low (1971), the average cost of a movie ticket was $1.50‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bCsnJMuBrS

I'm honored to be sworn into the 116th Congress today alongside a new Democratic majority that will deliver for the American people. We have a long road ahead to expand opportunity for all, restore faith in our democratic system, and defend our values as Americans. #NCpol
It‚Äôs shameful that House Republicans are sitting on their hands while the #TrumpShutdown overshadows their last day in power. The new Democratic majority will work swiftly to reopen the government and provide certainty for hundreds of thousands of families affected.
On Thursday, the House will take up legislation already passed in the Senate to responsibly fund the government, without paying for Trump's ridiculous wall. Republicans have a choice: do their duty to keep the government open or cave to his childish demands. #TrumpShutdown

800,000 federal employees are at home over the holidays wondering if they‚Äôll receive their next pay check because @realDonaldTrump shut down the government. Mexico wouldn‚Äôt pay for his wall and neither will American taxpayers, so he has decided to throw a tantrum. #TrumpShutdown
Trump can throw tantrums on Twitter all he wants, but we all know who's shutting down the government. https://t.co/lE254jt3Nv
To recap, the #GOPTaxScam:   -Blew up the deficit by $2 trillion -Undermined healthcare for millions with preexisting conditions -Handed out trillions in cuts to billionaires &amp; corporations -AND didn't stop volatility on wall street  That's the legacy @SpeakerRyan leaves behind. https://t.co/QRtDzlJF0w
The President's decision to blindside Congress, the Pentagon, and the State Dept with a tweet withdrawing troops from #Syria proves once again how unstable he is.

In the final act of Republican control in Washington, Congress will once again kick the can down the road &amp; fail to fully fund the government. Even worse, they're doing so because President Trump couldn't get a border wall that he told us Mexico would pay for in the first place.

At a time when our elections are plagued by unlimited corporate spending, anonymous donors, and illegal foreign meddling, the Trump admin‚Äôs decision to obscure millions in dark campaign money weakens our already failing campaign finance system and diminishes the power of voters.
The Trump admin recently decided to allow special interests &amp; foreign entities to hide major campaign donors from the IRS. Following yesterday's Senate passage of @SenatorTester &amp; @RonWyden's bill reversing this rule, I introduced a companion bill in the House this morning. https://t.co/kWvRWCcPwC
I was pleased to introduce the Spotlight Act with @SenatorTester to shine a light on dark campaign money. The House should follow the Senate's lead and repeal the IRS rule that makes the problem worse. Read more about my bill: https://t.co/QFox0nIUNo https://t.co/5uUypwMfbB

As dean of the NC delegation, I support the call for an emergency hearing by @GOPoversight &amp; @OversightDems to ascertain the extent of this fraud and take appropriate action as needed.
Thanks to great local reporting, the evidence of widespread election fraud in NC-9 seems to be mounting. As the @NCSBE continues to investigate, we must consider all remedies, up to and including a special election to ensure the voter‚Äôs voices are accurately heard.

Pleased to be joined by Mayor @NancyMcFarlane, @crowder4council, and my entire staff to tour Raleigh‚Äôs @dixpark, an incredibly exciting public-private partnership that will serve the entire community. https://t.co/aSXpclvk5i
Wishing all those celebrating a happy and joyful #Hanukkah https://t.co/Db6yh89ke0
We mourn the death of President George H. W. Bush. He was a skilled diplomat and champion of American alliances, co-architect of a major budget agreement that improved our fiscal future, and one of the most effective modern presidents in working with both parties in the Congress.
Millions of children around the world are #HIV-free thanks to the incredible work of our global health programs. This #WorldAIDSDay, Congress must recommit to #EndAIDS and one day reach an AIDS-free generation. https://t.co/SIlYpPSXHq
Today is a sad day for the Durham community. Samuel Oliver-Bruno‚Äôs arrest and deportation are a failure of justice, and we are demanding answers. My full statement with @GKButterfield: https://t.co/DKRfmz00eP
Allegations of misconduct must be thoroughly investigated to guarantee the outcome of this election reflects the will of the voters. That's why we're calling on the State Board to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to certifying the election results.
This afternoon, @GKButterfield, @RepAdams, and I released a statement on the North Carolina Board of Elections' bipartisan decision to delay certification of NC-09 election results. Read full statement here: https://t.co/M6dpYICgTE
Today is the #NetNeutrality Day of Action! Without Net Neutrality rules, internet providers can block, throttle, or create fast and slow lanes on your access to the internet. We must act NOW to restore the free and open internet. https://t.co/Dce3gTCBBK
The Senate will vote today on a man who defended the worst voter suppression &amp; disenfranchisement tactics in the nation. Thomas Farr's confirmation would be an affront to impartiality, an insult to voters of color, and a threat to free &amp; fair elections for all. #StoppFarr
Tonight, @GKButterfield &amp; I were notified that Samuel Oliver-Bruno's petition for deferred deportation has been denied. Mr. Oliver-Bruno's treatment by the Trump admin has been a miscarriage of justice--and we're calling on @SecNielsen to immediately reverse his order of removal. https://t.co/tfknnfAkhC
The images coming from our southern border of families being tear-gassed as they seek refuge from persecution, disaster, and turmoil are haunting. Plain and simple: the Trump immigration agenda is un-American and Democrats will do everything in our power to reverse it. https://t.co/HLgGDJOzmo
Mr. Farr has an alarming history defending voter suppression, supporting racial/political gerrymandering, and intimidating African American voters. His record clearly demonstrates he would not only be a partial jurist, but a threat to voters everywhere. #StopFarr https://t.co/6iDF0qemcE
Today, along with my colleagues, @RepAdams and @GKButterfield, I sent a letter to @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell urging the cancellation of all votes on the nomination of Thomas A. Farr for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court of Eastern NC. https://t.co/DMLqpTjzLd
UPDATE: This weekend, @GKButterfield &amp; I secured a commitment from @ICEgov not deport Samuel Oliver-Bruno until his deferment claim is heard. But the circumstances of his arrest &amp; detention are unacceptable, &amp; I'm continuing to contact top DHS officials for his immediate release.
This morning, Samuel Oliver-Bruno was abruptly arrested by ICE agents as he visited local immigration offices to check-in on his status. My full statement with @GKButterfield can be viewed here: https://t.co/4k26pinK2g https://t.co/uEe88Ap6vB

Once again, President Trump has rebuffed our nation‚Äôs intelligence agencies to the detriment of our nation‚Äôs values and interests. My full statement on Trump's defense of Saudi Arabia: https://t.co/cc6OKDV7Io https://t.co/VIhKfW2JAO
As I said when it was announced, Trump‚Äôs asylum policy is not only callous and un-American, it‚Äôs a blatant violation of federal law. https://t.co/wHnkEwlgvs
President Trump exploited our nation's service members to sow fear in Americans ahead of a national election--a disgraceful abuse of power that was categorically ignored by Congressional Republicans. https://t.co/xNRQz47bLb
.@DukeU President Price is right: this is a craven and cowardly act that has no place in our community. We must confront and speak out against hate wherever it occurs. https://t.co/94uHWVzd00
üö®IMPORTANT THREADüëá https://t.co/rjGmyB1989
As Democrats regain the majority in the House, there are many priorities we must deliver on for the American people. At the top of my list:  üá∫üá∏Comprehensive democracy reform  üèó Real investment in our nation‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure  üîç Robust oversight of Trump administration https://t.co/RngkBHH66j
In our letter, we point out the severe risks posed to vulnerable populations such as children, low-income individuals, and communities of color if the Trump administration succeeds in gutting the CPP and replacing it with it's far weaker plan. Read more: https://t.co/qTT5SFyKcm
Today, along with 100+ colleagues, I sent a letter to @EPAAWheeler urging him to reinstate the Clean Power Plan, which was a landmark achievement in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change, and protecting the health and safety of the American people. https://t.co/uEYN3bkX0o
HUD‚Äôs failure to enforce adequate property standards has left thousands of residents in dilapidated conditions &amp; more of our affordable housing stock at risk of disrepair. As the incoming THUD Appropriations Chairman, I plan to hold this administration accountable on this issue. https://t.co/ipSCRNA6MT
I'm proud to continue representing N.C.‚Äôs 4th District in Congress. As we look ahead to the Democratic House majority, I am ready to resume the fight for affordable health care, an economy that works for everyone, and a democracy that empowers people over special interests. https://t.co/UwjXUj1ML6
Many people have asked me what is the first thing Democrats will do when we regain the majority. As a Vice Chair of the House Democracy Reform Task Force, I'm proud to say this is the answer. https://t.co/qrAUYNyXlB

I'm honored to continue representing North Carolina's Fourth District, and I'm ready to resume the fight for progress on the issues my constituents care about in the 116th Congress.
The American people spoke last Tuesday. They voted to protect health care for millions. They voted against massive tax handouts to the super rich. They voted to reduce the power of special interests. And they voted for a House that'll be a check on Donald Trump's reckless agenda.
While we take time this #VeteransDay2018 to express our gratitude to our nation‚Äôs veterans and their families, let us never forget our duty to meet the needs of those who answered the call to serve. @UNCMedCenter https://t.co/UoUvb8JqLL
Lisa &amp; I were proud to present Mickey Michaux with a copy of my remarks for the Congressional Record honoring his more than 4 decades of outstanding service to the people of NC. Mickey retires as a Civil Rights icon, a champion for social justice, and a trusted friend &amp; advisor. https://t.co/074j2gaEpL
Beautiful, unifying Veterans Day ceremonies offer a heartbreaking contrast to the abuse and exploitation of our troops at the border by a deeply cynical president. https://t.co/qhl9A6Fqs1
Agreed. That‚Äôs why my Stand By Every Ad Act would require super PAC ads to list the names of their top contributors on the screen. https://t.co/04OtqlSvlO
Counting every eligible vote is the DEFINITION of a democratic election. The only fraud happening here is Republicans pretending to care about the integrity of our elections. https://t.co/GyYjteOkn1
America has always been a place of refuge for those fleeing desperate situations, but Donald Trump has undermined that fundamental promise. This massive executive overreach is not only heartless &amp; un-American, it's a blatant violation of the law that must be challenged in court.
After narrowing grounds for asylum, separating families at the border, &amp; systematically turning asylum seekers away, Trump now wants to refuse any individual not crossing at a port of entry‚Äîeliminating the possibility for some to obtain the protection &amp; safety guaranteed by law. https://t.co/RBaeUoNn30
Thank you to all the veterans and family members who attended my annual Fourth District Veterans Briefing. This event allows us to honor those who have served, discuss pending veterans legislation, and connect vets with community resources. #VeteransDay2018 https://t.co/ZCxWPVeAWa
.@WRAL has it right: through extreme gerrymandering, NC Republicans have rigged our state's elections, subverting the will of voters to choose their representatives. My bill, the We The People Act, would end this practice and begin to restore integrity to our elections. https://t.co/J2TZyOIzhT
Another heartbreaking reminder of the epidemic of gun violence that plagues our nation. While our hearts go out to the victims and their families, our work should go towards ensuring others don‚Äôt have to endure this pain. https://t.co/pOvhQN5k6f

President Trump is using the cloud of an election defeat to strike a major blow to the independence &amp; integrity of the Justice Department. Republicans must immediately stand with Democrats to protect the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation. https://t.co/uQ6aLXKTGU

Instead of cynically turning our military troops into props in a campaign ad, Trump should focus on addressing the real causes of the migrant crisis, of which he is certainly one. https://t.co/cYNZWvh6QB
Using the military for such a blatantly political stunt is not only morally repugnant, it will actually undermine military readiness and distract from more dangerous threats, while doing nothing to address the root causes of migration. https://t.co/MNaTXJOdLl
Let‚Äôs be clear: Donald Trump‚Äôs deployment of active duty troops to the southern border has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with election-year politics. https://t.co/RpLFvv5tYv

Trump knows he can‚Äôt run on his record of stripping health care to pay for tax handouts to the wealthy, so he is doubling down on distraction and division. Be outraged, but don‚Äôt be fooled. Stay focused. https://t.co/IXkChQZLTZ

Horrible news out of Pittsburgh today.  The epidemic of hate-filled violence in our country must be confronted. The time for action to reduce gun  violence is long overdue.

This decision not only harms US interests in the region, but undermines the legitimate pursuit of a two-state solution. @realDonaldTrump is actively cutting off pathways to peace in the Middle East. Actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/FIJjVBBfCT
Words matter.¬†Leadership matters.¬†This is the country @realDonaldTrump has created, and he must condemn such acts of terrorism in the strongest terms. https://t.co/1w0gLtqRI5
President Trump's bigotry and discrimination against the LGBTQ community knows no bounds. Rather than attacking the humanity and identity of transgender individuals, we should be ensuring their equal rights and protections. #WontBeErased https://t.co/y6wl9OFI2t
When my colleagues &amp; I asked the @StateDept why their global report on human rights excludes reproductive rights, they responded to "reduce the reporting burden." Does the Trump administration not think reproductive rights are human rights? Or is it just not worth the paperwork?
Great visit to @NCState today to meet with students in the @ParkScholarship program. We discussed what leadership means today and how their scholarship and service contribute to the strength of our community. https://t.co/E8kDP3scuP

President Trump and Senate Republicans have sent a message to would-be sexual aggressors that their misconduct may well go unpunished, and to victims that they may not only be ignored, but actually publicly ridiculed. (5/5)
Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation is a tremendous step backward for an independent judiciary, an impartial confirmation process, and a thorough examination of the background of judicial nominees. (4/5)
Asked to respond to these claims, Judge Kavanaugh displayed a remarkable lack of judicial temperament, attacking Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee and alleging political conspiracies against him. (3/5)
Kavanaugh‚Äôs examination was hampered by the White House‚Äôs refusal to release highly relevant records from his political service. Sens. Leahy &amp; Durbin in particular cited instances where he had been less than truthful. Then came several credible claims of sexual misconduct. (2/5)
From the start, we‚Äôve known Judge Kavanaugh was an extremely partisan judge, handpicked by ideological interest groups hellbent on undermining voting rights, unions, environmental protection, &amp; reproductive freedom. (1/5)
A 5 day investigation with less than 10 interviews isn‚Äôt an investigation at all, it‚Äôs a sham.   Donald Trump &amp; Republican leadership only care about one thing: fast-tracking a nominee to the Court, regardless of his unacceptable temperament or credible allegations of misconduct.
To benefit the oil &amp; gas lobby, the Trump admin wants to undermine worker safety &amp; environmental rules put in place after #DeepwaterHorizon. Along w/ @RepBarragan &amp; @RepCharlieCrist, I introduced the #SafeCOASTAct to protect our coastal communities. https://t.co/Aki9l7gov3
To hold a vote without a proper FBI investigation of these claims would be a tremendous disservice to these women, the Supreme Court, and all Americans.
In light of her testimony, and the numerous other credible claims alleged against Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump should rescind his nomination immediately.
Dr. Ford has demonstrated tremendous courage and poise in appearing before the @senjudiciary today. Her testimony was recognized by Democrats and Republicans as credible and earnest, and she should be commended for her bravery in recounting her story in this manner.
The Trump admin's decision to allow dark money organizations to obscure millions in campaign money weakens our already failing campaign finance system. I introduced the Spotlight Act with @SenatorTester to reverse this decision. https://t.co/QFox0nIUNo
ICYMI: I spoke on the House floor earlier to thank my colleagues in the NC delegation, @NC_Governor, and @Transport &amp; @AppropsDems committees for helping to secure the $1.68 billion down payment in disaster recovery funds to help North Carolina rebuild after #HurricaneFlorence. https://t.co/HbI70AaUhu

I will continue working with my colleagues and the Appropriations Committee to secure additional funding to support recovery efforts in our state. (3/3)
While it‚Äôs clear additional funding will be required to meet the needs of the many communities still reeling from this storm, this funding, once enacted into law, will be a significant down payment that will help millions in NC &amp; elsewhere recover from recent disasters. (2/3)
I‚Äôm pleased to work with my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation and with @NC_Governor to secure $1.68 billion in disaster relief funding to help North Carolinians begin the work of rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane Florence.  (1/3) https://t.co/vvRjxk9YzV

In abandoning the Iran Nuclear Agreement and hosting this lackluster summit, President Trump has given credibility to the North Korean regime and diminished the likelihood that he could ever achieve a serious agreement. (4/4)
The President hastily agreed to a summit with the North Korean dictator with only one apparent precondition: that gross human rights abuses by North Korea would not be seriously discussed. (3/4)
In exchange for praising the world's most murderous regime and suspending U.S.-South Korean military exercises--President Trump achieved nothing but weak commitments, far, far short of the Iran Agreement he just trashed. (2/4)
A diplomatic approach towards denuclearizing North Korea is always preferred, but legitimizing and embracing a ruthless dictator while alienating our international allies weakens U.S. leverage and is not worth the vague promises offered by Kim Jong Un. (1/4)

It‚Äôs now abundantly clear that the Administration‚Äôs lackluster response to Hurricane Maria has cost thousands of lives - nearly triple the number of lives lost in Hurricane Katrina. This is unacceptable and a failure of the Trump White House on every level.

Thankful to be joined by the 5th grade students from the Raleigh School today during their field trip to Washington, DC. These bright young men and women asked important questions about government and the future of our nation, which they will one day lead! https://t.co/vneLp4Awiz
Children on #SNAP are more likely to graduate, break the cycle of poverty, and contribute to a productive economy in the future. I'm voting NO on the #GOPFarmBill to protect 265,000 kids across America who will lose access to meals at school if this bill passes. #HandsOffSNAP
On this International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia (IDAHOT), I am standing in solidarity with my colleagues, constituents, and many others to push back against violence and discrimination against the #LGBTQ community. #IDAHOT
Congratulations to Judge Keith Gregory on his appointment to the Wake County Superior Court. Judge Gregory is a devoted public servant and community philanthropist whose legal expertise will serve the people of North Carolina tremendously.
The future of the internet is at stake in the fight against the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #NetNeutrality.  I‚Äôm supporting legislation to #SaveTheInternet and ensure that all Americans have access to a free and open internet.
Although I'm stuck in DC today, my heart is with the thousands of teachers from North Carolina who are marching in solidarity. As the son of educators, I know that teachers are selfless public servants who want the best for the children they educate. They deserve better. #Red4Ed
I will be voting NO on H.R. 2, The Agriculture and Nutrition Act, because it fails to meet our commitments to rural communities, neglects environmental and energy considerations, and literally takes food off the table for millions of Americans. (5/5)
Additionally, the bill cuts conservation programs by more than $800 million, abandons bio-energy and energy-efficiency goals, and represents a missed opportunity to expand federal support for the organic farm industry. (4/5)
Family farmers, producers, and ranchers are still reeling from President Trump's reckless brinksmanship on tariffs, and yet, this bill fails to bolster trade assistance programs and slashes funding for rural development initiatives. (3/5)
As @SpeakerRyan approaches his retirement, he is hoping to check off another one of his bucket list items: gutting SNAP benefits by $23 million, putting millions of low-income Americans in jeopardy of food insecurity.  (2/5)
Rather than working with Democrats to craft a #FarmBill that supports American farmers and fulfills our commitment to nutrition assistance, Republicans in Congress chose a partisan strategy that abandons family farmers and millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet. (1/5)
To all those celebrating, I wish you a happy, peaceful, and fulfilling #Ramadan. https://t.co/tU9ZXNiBKb
Last year, I joined a federal lawsuit against President Trump because it was clear his pay-for-play business practices were illegal. Now, as Chinese companies funnel money into Trump's pockets, we learn they are also a risk to our national security.  https://t.co/JCQcE0nF85
Scott Pruitt's political staff is concealing vital health information to avoid a "public relations nightmare" for its industry insiders. One of many brazen political manipulations warranting resignation. #BootPruitt https://t.co/LJ1ChLQ46A
I was honored to deliver the commencement at @UNCPoliSci yesterday. The insights that political science offers about the power of collective action to bring change in a democracy are as relevant &amp; vital today as ever before. Congratulations graduates! https://t.co/wK034Jz6jE
The Trump administration's decision to move the U.S. embassy to #Jerusalem unilaterally undermines prospects for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and recklessly endangers U.S., Israeli, and regional security. https://t.co/UjBjlUn332
The Trump Administration's policy of taking children from their families solely because they are immigrants is cruel and inhumane. This #MothersDay, I'm standing with all the mothers who simply want a better life for their children. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/t62gQpwA05
Joined by my colleagues this morning, I told reporters that "by pulling out of the #IranDeal, President Trump has unilaterally isolated us from our partners, put Israel and the region at a greater risk, and diminished our leverage to hold Tehran accountable." https://t.co/PDTVVhB2YV
TODAY AT 10:30am: I'll be joining @NancyPelosi and other House colleagues in responding to President Trump‚Äôs misguided decision to terminate U.S. participation in the #IranNuclearDeal. Tune in here: https://t.co/0qGpsCU4JD
Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Fuller Elementary School, where I talked with teachers and administrators about how lawmakers can support their work. I also presented them with a flag that had been flown over the Capitol in Washington. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/V5hzUatgaw
.@realDonaldTrump's casual suggestions to jail journalists or strip them of their credentials is a despotic reflex that should be universally condemned. His affinity for dictators and strongmen is concerning, but when he models their behaviors we must speak out. https://t.co/b5YTQampe7
In violating the #IranNuclearDeal, President Trump has triggered a self-inflicted crisis that will increase oil prices and decrease U.S. leverage. He is clearly more concerned with dismantling @BarackObama's legacy than with dismantling Iran's nuclear program.
President Trump has consistently demonstrated his ignorance of the complexity of the world‚Äôs challenges and today‚Äôs decision further highlights his inability to protect U.S. interests abroad. (6/6)
.@realDonaldTrump's actions serve only to isolate us from our allies, to encourage Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, and to dissuade nations from negotiating agreements with the United States. (5/6)
With no strategy in Iran and no vision in the Middle East, President Trump‚Äôs reckless decision will increase tensions in hot spots around the world, push the United States closer to armed conflict with Iran, and severely diminish U.S. leadership and leverage. (4/6)
In his efforts to destroy this agreement, President Trump ignores consistent assurances of Iranian compliance from senior military and intelligence officials, independent inspectors, and our international partners, including Israeli security officials. (3/6)
Since its creation, the Iran Deal has implemented the most stringent verification and monitoring standards ever placed on a nation, successfully preventing Iran from developing or obtaining a nuclear weapon. (2/6)
Make no mistake: by reimposing sanctions lifted in the Iran Nuclear Agreement, President Trump has manufactured an international crisis that risks an armed conflict with a nuclear Iran. (1/6) https://t.co/v3rBTCdX9I
As I said in January, delaying implementation of HUD's fair housing rule will hinder efforts to reduce systemic discrimination. Since Trump's HUD refuses to protect equal opportunity in housing, the courts must intervene. @natfairhouse https://t.co/1jSbQXQLTf
As the son of educators &amp; as a former professor, I've seen the impact that a teacher can have on a student.

While much of our collective attention focuses on another Trump scandal, his mass-deportation agenda continues to tear apart tens of thousands of families.¬†He has abandoned our national commitment to serve as a place of refuge from violence and disaster. https://t.co/kTFYsrtE3e
There‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúsmall‚Äù about the impact of #SmallBiz on the American economy: they have created 40% of all new jobs over the past 20 years! I‚Äôm proud to visit Full Bloom Coffee, Grafix House, and Locs, Naturals, and More in @TownofGarner today for #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/N1JYophaW0

Scott Pruitt's time at the @EPA has been mired with secrecy, waste of taxpayer money &amp; widespread conflicts of interest.

A reminder on #TaxDay that @realDonaldTrump still hasn't released his tax returns, breaking a 40-year precedent going back to Nixon. My 'We the People Act' would require the President &amp; Vice President to release their three most recent returns. https://t.co/jqY2fmCZuw

President Trump's lack of a calculated diplomatic or military strategy, as well as his disdain for refugees fleeing the crisis, have complicated a situation that will not be resolved by a single bombing campaign. (3/3)
A coordinated international response may be required as part of a comprehensive strategy in Syria, but President Trump has yet to develop any such strategy, to consult with Congress, or to seek a renewed authorization for the use of force. (2/3)
Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on his own civilians is abhorrent and beyond the pale, as is the support and defense of the Assad regime by the Russian government. (1/3)

Director Pompeo‚Äôs nomination might mean a Secretary of State who is more in sync with @realDonaldTrump, but it won‚Äôt resolve the basic problem he faces: an erratic and reckless President and a diminished and disillusioned diplomatic corps.

I called for Devin Nunes‚Äô removal from the Intel Committee b/c it was clear he lacked the integrity to protect our elections &amp; national security in a bipartisan way. His abrupt end to this investigation w/ no input from the minority solidifies his legacy as a Trump/Putin abettor. https://t.co/uYIWOmOMq6

.@SpeakerRyan: the American people demand action.

The #TrumpShutdown is completely unnecessary. Republicans spent months pushing a $1.5 trillion tax scam for corporations, rather than addressing the need to assemble a budget, the status of CHIP/DACA, and number of other priorities. https://t.co/1NZ8ZLnZ8E
Congress has offered a bipartisan solution to get us out of this mess. But as long as extremist west wing staffers pull @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs strings, the White House won‚Äôt get to 'yes' on ending the #TrumpShutdown.
Tune in to @NewDay NOW to hear me talk about how Democrats are fighting for bipartisan solutions to end the #TrumpShutdown
Republicans are in the majority, they control what bills are voted on. @WhipHoyer introduced a bill that gets us out of this mess and addresses both party‚Äôs concerns, and it would pass easily. It‚Äôs that simple. #TrumpShutdown
Although I‚Äôd rather be in Raleigh for the Women‚Äôs March, my colleagues and I remain committed to fighting for bipartisan solutions to keep the government running. https://t.co/jBwcefoMWd
If Democrats and Republicans both want children to keep their health insurance, Dreamers not to be deported, and our government to stay open, then put a bill on the floor now that does that. They won‚Äôt do it, because the President won‚Äôt let them. #TrumpShutdown
President Trump has spent the past year undermining our democratic norms and dividing Americans at every turn. Even during the #TrumpShutdown he‚Äôd rather mingle with billionaires than show an ounce of leadership. https://t.co/AMoy4qgeUM
@SenateMajLdr .@realdonaldtrump and the Republican majority just turned the #TrumpShutdown into reality because they don‚Äôt want DREAMers to stay in the country or sick children to have health insurance - yet he calls Democrats ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù #SolidLeadership
The @SenateMajLdr is right, this #TrumpShutdown was 100% avoidable. The President had a bipartisan deal to fix what he broke, and he reneged on his promises, pushing us to a shutdown. He has no capacity to lead, and the American people are witnessing it in action.
The President created the DACA problem then asked for a bipartisan immigration deal to fix it. The senate came up with a bipartisan deal and he changed his mind hours later. Now he‚Äôs trying to blame democrats, who don‚Äôt control any branches of government. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/TJGH4eF6Za
After spending months ignoring CHIP &amp; DACA to focus on passing a $1.5 trillion tax plan for corporations, Republicans are now on the brink of shutting down the government, potentially leaving millions furloughed without pay.
A great country can‚Äôt be governed by temporary funding month-to-month. We need a bipartisan budget deal now. We‚Äôre already 4 months into the fiscal year with no agreement thanks to GOP disarray.
1. President Trump created the DACA problem.   2. President Trump rejected a bipartisan immigration plan to fix it and keep the government open.   3. President Trump is pushing us towards a shutdown, and the GOP congress is enabling him.
The U.S. government has never shut down with one party controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress. Democrats are fighting for bipartisan solutions to keep the government running. Republicans are booking flights to Davos and Mar-a-Lago.
FACT: there's a bipartisan immigration bill that already has the votes to pass both houses TODAY. President Trump blew up the deal and is sending us towards a shutdown to advance his racist, mass-deportation agenda.

I join my colleagues @GKButterfield and @RepAdams in calling on the @senjudiciary to reject Mr. Farr's nomination to the Eastern District court. #FarrTooExtreme
Mr. Farr's nomination is opposed by the @OfficialCBC, @NAACP_LDF, @RevDrBarber and countless others who understand the threats posed to the African American community by Mr. Farr's racially insensitive past.
North Carolinians are well aware of Mr. Farr's dubious history defending voter suppression, supporting racial/political gerrymandering, and intimidating African American voters. Even worse, his seat would oversee a district with a sizable African American population.
Today, the @senjudiciary will consider the nomination of Thomas Farr to serve as district judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina. I strongly oppose this nomination.

There's no doubt, Republicans will use the $1.5 trillion in debt incurred by their #GOPTaxScam as a pretense to gut Medicare and Medicaid. We must stand ready to protect the middle class, defend these programs, and offer Americans a better deal. #HandsOff https://t.co/vDhorETSSG
Yesterday's court ruling requiring the Trump administration to resume the DACA program is important, but it is far from a lasting solution to protect our nation's Dreamers. It's time for Congress to bring the #DreamAct to the floor without delay. https://t.co/u5rh2MPHSP
Republican and Democratic governors from states up and down both coasts, including @NC_Governor, have made this same appeal. Coastal tourism is not unique to Florida @SecretaryZinke.

It's been 100 days since Republicans in Congress let the Children's Health Insurance Program funding expire. Health insurance for 9 million children has taken a backseat to handing out $1.5 trillion to corporations and the wealthy. #CHIP

Republicans are sending a clear message with their Ed cuts: they don't support the educators preparing to teach the next generation.

I will keep fighting to ensure that immigration enforcement prioritizes dangerous criminals rather than contributing members of society.
I offered an amendment to shift funding for these misguided enforcement activities to increase customs staffing at airports &amp; ports of entry
Trump's lack of prioritization &amp; wide-net approach led to a surge in immigration arrests explicitly designed to tear communities apart.
Trump's DHS is failing to humanely enforce our nation‚Äôs immigration laws without causing undue upheaval or collateral damage.
During today's DHS Appropriations markup, I took action to hold President Trump accountable for his deeply misguided immigration policies.

Despite what Mr. Trump believes, we don't have to endanger the environment and coastal communities to build a stronger energy future.
It also puts the US at risk of falling behind those countries that are investing in renewable energy solutions.
This order disregards the bipartisan opposition of dozens of coastal communities concerned about tourism, fishing, and the environment
Today's White House Executive Order puts at risk NC's coastal communities and fisheries, which are among our most precious natural assets.

A #PiDay fact: if the 24 million who will lose coverage under TrumpCare stood in a circle, the diameter would stretch from Raleigh to L.A.! https://t.co/5aC6SPexM4
The repeal proposal is terrible policy - clearly Trump &amp; Republicans care more about special interests than the health of Americans
4.) The Republican proposal would increase out-of-pocket health costs significantly, especially for older Americans
3.) The Republican proposal would cause premiums to increase by an average of 24-29 percent over the next two years
2.) The Republican proposal would cause 7 million Americans to lose their EMPLOYER-PROVIDED health coverage
1.) The Republican proposal would take health coverage away from 24 million Americans by 2026, include 14 million next year alone

Gutting the Coast Guard to pay for President Trump's foolhardy wall will weaken our homeland security, not strengthen it.

I'm voting against the #GOPbudget. A budget is a statement of our priorities &amp; values. The House #GOPBudget gets both wrong. #ncpol
The House #GOPBudget would result in 3 million job losses through 2016. #ncpol
At the same time it cuts programs that help seniors, #vets &amp; kids, the #GOPBudget gives those making over $1M/yr a $200k tax cut. #ncpol
The House #GOPBudget gets 69% of its cuts from programs that help low-moderate income Americans, including seniors, #vets &amp; kids. #ncpol
W/3 applicants for every job #NC's people still need help. #RenewUI will help ensure that losing a job doesn't mean economic ruin. #ncpol
Last mo., #NC led US in job losses. Our labor mkt continues to shrink. This is not a 'Carolina Comeback.' It's a Carolina Catastrophe #ncpol
Despite blatant misrepresentations by the Speaker &amp; Majority Leader, CBO confirms #RenewUI would create jobs/strengthen recovery. #ncpol
After bispartisan Senate passage, for the House to ignore the #RenewUI bill would be unconscionable. #ncpol
