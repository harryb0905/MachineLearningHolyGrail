4. What's my favorite sports blog?
3. What's my favorite pizza?
2. What band did I write a review on last summer for Houston Press?
1. How many brothers do I have?
I'm going to tweet out 6 questions. The first to respond with all six correct answers in one tweet wins the tickets to the game tomorrow.
Time to see who has been paying attention. Ten minutes...
I will get back to you all around nine tonight with the contest.  #BullsOnParade
