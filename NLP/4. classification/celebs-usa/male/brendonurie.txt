It's funny how something like a loss of power forces neighbors to finally go outside and converse with each other. "Hey you lost power too?"
Also, the reason I'm reading instead of playing video games today is because a power line fell behind my house and blew-up the transformer.

Great show at @thelaughfactory last night. @chrisdelia is a true class act. It's not easy to joke about poo and come out looking so clean.

“@anneatthedisco: @brendonboydurie I like that no one knows you're talking about the film titled Red Eye. Further proves how shitty it is.”
Waiting for this red-eye flight is almost like that shitty movie with Rachel McAdams. Almost.
“@HeyyMonique: @brendonboydurie alcohal is gross so...” I'm sure this "alco-Hal" you speak of is. But alcohol is great and I love it.
Damnit. The only place that's closed in this airport is the one place that serves beer. I must've really pissed Yahweh off. #NotJewish
Can't wait to get back to Los Angeles and make some music with some really sweet dudes. Really sweet.
Hey, followers, I love you. So don't worry. Just reciprocate the love and we're golden. You jerks.
“@RyanGottshall: @brendonboydurie If you block my phone # then I'll be forced to stalk you. FORCED TO.” Dude. Super blocked.
And for those who may be concerned, saying, "Don't block me!" is just asking for a block.
I just found out how to block people on Twitter. This is going to be fun.
Heading home from Hawaii today, I have a plethora of freckles to show for it. Little tan, lots of freckles. You're jealous. I can tell.
When you're sliding into home and your pants are full of foam, change your diet. (Notice the correct uses of "you're" and "your." Thanks.)
My body is a wonderland... that also produces mucus and feces.
The weirdest noise I've ever made somewhat resembles a snort. And it occurs as I'm waking up, so I can hear how embarrassing I sound.
Here's something awesome you can watch: http://t.co/5YaUUHZt Follow @jacobgivens bc he's a funny guy.
On a related note, it's sad to see how some people spend their time being someone else. I suggest getting out of the house. Or exercise.
Sorry, folks, I do not have a Tumblr. Just Twitter. The rest are imposters. And shame on you for presuming otherwise. #beliefwithoutproof
Ah, man. That was so funny. What I just heard from someone. It was really funny.
I like the manner in which your hips and limbs explore their space.
Just watched Frederick Wiseman's "Highschool." I'm not sure how available it is, but it's well worth the effort.
I'm sleeping under the tree tonight. And at the right moment I'll pop out, scaring Santa and ending his reign of terror once and for all!

Just so everyone is aware, American Horror Story is one of the most disturbing shows I've ever seen. I like it.

“@CharlottePond: @brendonboydurie you're high?? THINK OF THE KIDS” Why would I think about kids when I'm high? Weirdo.
But, then again, sometimes you just have to tweet when you're high. Anyone else hungry?
I don't tweet when I'm high because it takes me too long to decide if what I tweeted is the right thing to tweet at that moment.
“@XsugeNastyX: This girl is for real and the Big Gulp cup MAKES the video... http://t.co/NQrEYhGP” This girl has got IT.

Thank you, Sacramento. Tonight was a success.. meaning I didn't throw up on anyone. And I saw a unicorn stage-dive. A very old unicorn.

Jet-lag is a dick. Doesn't even have the courtesy to offer me hallucinations anymore. Least you could do is make it fun, jet-lag. You jerk.
