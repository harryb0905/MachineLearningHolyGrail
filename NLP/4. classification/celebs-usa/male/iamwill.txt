1. An investment for a kids education in the hood is 5k 2. All of those kids will most likely end up in Prison 3. those Prisons are privately owned   Meaning: Prisoners are owned   4. That‚Äôs new age slavery  5. How do we REVOLT when our music promotes drugs &amp; crime?  #EDUCATION https://t.co/9A6IZiRQis
There were lots on slaves that revolted &amp; they were lynched or shot &amp; raped, physically, psychologically with spiritual warfare that is still present today... to say that was their choice is to blame it all on our ancestors &amp; it Disrespects their suffering... https://t.co/XhLAFV9Kh8
You obviously don‚Äôt know the conditions in the hood...A proper investment on education is a human right... zoning in our ghettos so that healthy opportunity is on every corner... we didn‚Äôt chose our zoning... we didn‚Äôt chose the conditions we live in... please enlighten me. https://t.co/zAzGwiBUDt
A choice is when there are options...  Please tell me the options our ancestors had???  Enlighten me please... https://t.co/HZOhl3So4n
.@kanyewest   #slavery vs #prisons   Reality:  its not &amp; never was by choice.  This wickedness was done by force &amp; strategic conditioning. &amp; education deprivation is at the root.  The fact that the USA builds prisons &amp; not schools, is not our choice  https://t.co/eCSLcypo5W

You can‚Äôt love with an ego...if you love with EGO, you actually end up hurting what you say you love...and that kind of love is selfish love...not selfless love...selfless LOVE is true love...(let the E go) #selflessLOVE #whereIStheLOVE [?]
