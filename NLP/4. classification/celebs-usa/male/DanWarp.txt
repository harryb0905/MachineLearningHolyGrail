@undurscore YEP. We've already had @MatthewBennett from Victorious.  And Kel Mitchell  said he'd love to have the original All That cast on!
@robertd2468 :) :)
@undurscore Unfortunately, they're not for sale anywhere yet.  But they should be!  I'll try.
@robertd2468 Always.  I have an idea what my next one MIGHT be :)
@SashaRachel1 Hope so!  No plans, but I'd love to.
@SashaRachel1 Ha!  That is one of my favorite questions I've ever been asked!  Wish I had a good answer.  Let me think...
@snathan432 @GameShakers :)
@ckfilmz @NickelodeonTV I love All That, too!  First TV show I ever created/produced :)
@HenryDangerWiki Hmmm.. not sure, but I THINK G.S. season one was 20 eps, and so is season 2.  For H.D., season 3 will be 20 eps or more :)

I was just told LESS THAN ONE HOUR FROM NOW.  It's on its way!    Here's one last hint:  It's been 10 years.  You've waited long enough :)
A lot of you are guessing correctly :)  And, although it's just a little surprise, I think your mind is going to be BLOWN.
HINT #2: The little surprise I have for some fans... let's just say... today is the day.
HINT #1: The little surprise (that's coming later today) has NOTHING to do with my two •current• TV shows, @HenryDanger and @GameShakers.
There's quite the fun little surprise coming today.  I'm smiling just thinking about the reaction.  Stay tuned, y'all... ;)
@caden_m_clauson You already have - by watching!  You're part of the family :)
@http_jayxl wow, thank you so much!!!!!! :)
