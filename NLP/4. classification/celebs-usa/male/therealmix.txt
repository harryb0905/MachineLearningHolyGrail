I want to thank @RSherman_25 for bringing us something we couldn‚Äôt imagine 30years ago.  You gave this team an identity, a voice and a championship.  Maybe now, people will understand your views on contractual negotiations?  One injury &amp; bye? smh.  Good luck &amp; Thank you brotha!

@say_duh_nelle Well just a smidge
@amychua I completely agree with your opinions on political tribes.  Even as you explained it on @HBO the panelist couldn‚Äôt stop doing it.  You‚Äôre a definite breath of fresh air.  #truth
@YakimaTazz @willcain It it should‚Äôve that simple boss
@JakeMarc23 It‚Äôs the ‚Äúsurviving the ground‚Äù part that‚Äôs sketchy to me
@tmassart @willcain No.  Currently the ground can force an incompletion even after an obvious catch
Ok @willcain here‚Äôs how the definition of a catch can can be simplified.  Ball is  secured while (or before) a football move is made.  If the ground jars the ball loose it‚Äôs a fumble except in the end zone.
@Lambo_Bellevue teasing me again.  Hmm #rollsroyce #sirmixalot https://t.co/feGtO7UjVo
You‚Äôre right @willcain   Sports are a much needed break from ‚Äúda real‚Äù

@MikeBarbre  :-(  man you had to mention that
@MikeBarbre  I guess I remember Celtics, Lakers &amp; Pistons in the '80s. Fierce
@MikeBarbre  but once the Bull became dominant.  They destroyed everybody.  Didn't they have a 70 win season?
@CJRockford good point
Jordan didn't have a nemesis.  Every dominant team needs a rival. Redskins/Cowboys lakers/celtics. Pistons vs civilization

@ANM90 @SPINmagazine @JLo  DAAAAAMNNN
@SPINmagazine @JLo  misquotes go a long way.  JLo is fine though
@1978BABY youre exactly right. In that era sistas were forced to assimilate as opposed to being themselves. I pointed 2 JLo as the body type
@tabithaAngus11 @Nwtuningtech I'm there now
@Nwtuningtech  I'm the Seahawk Yoda
@DCEE88 @ComplexMusic @JLo  no 1 person inspired it.  It was my frustration with how women of color were portrayed in Hollywood then.
@ComplexMusic @JLo  I was a bit misquoted by @TMZ but oh well. Such is life.
@1978BABY  before you read misquotes you need to talk to me.  Good luck
@hijinksandhalos @BuzzFeed yep!

@SanFranciscoVC @franklucianoIII  yes sir
@franklucianoIII @SanFranciscoVC right on man. The idea keeps evolving. I've gotta stop that
@AdrienneEvey  hahaha. You're sweet
@philoking  I use Kontact and MachFive3. Kontact's workflow is goofy for me and MachFive3 has no good sounds.  I like to shape my own stuff
@philoking  I mean the ones that play real sounds not analog
@philoking  what soft sampler do you use?  Kontact?
@philoking quick access and easy editing.  A bunch of sounds on tap is cool.  Real sounds not that reverb drenched demo stuff
@tomsummerfield cool
@philoking  got @AvidProTools 11 running. Loving it. Bought a Roland Integra 7 and having midi issues with it.  Multi-timbal mode locks up.

@68drop  they don't deserve a meal &amp; flight at a decent hour? Wow $61mil surplus and no underwear money. Btw most don't go pro but all eat.
@68drop  so flying at 4am 'cause the NCAA is cheap is ok?  Not talking pay I'm talking food, etc. or allow them to monetize their likeness
@JennyPurr @philoking  how's that product gonna grow with no incentive for developers?
@philoking @JennyPurr are you serious?
@philoking @JennyPurr huh?
@JennyPurr @philoking probably no IP
@JennyPurr @philoking  I have a cool idea for google glasses
@philoking needs apps
@El_Daverino @ESPN_FirstTake @stephenasmith  how much of a surplus does the NCAA gain in that  4year period
@notracistriley @ESPN_FirstTake @stephenasmith  right on
@philoking  dammit
@gpalmmm @stephenasmith  a $70mil surplus should certainly allow these kids to fly home at a reasonable hour.  Geez
Thank you @stephenasmith @ESPN_FirstTake for telling the truth about how the NCAA treats these kids.  Legalized Pimpin'.  SMH

@funkalicious69 @JeanetteJoy  don't take the kids
@mr922a  thank you man. Life is evolution.   Sometimes. :-)
@Helsieboo @Xtinedunlop me too
@ricks51 @stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless well said
@Xtinedunlop daaaaammmnnnn!!!! Nice
@BaySportsMom @ESPN_FirstTake agreed
@DA_REALCOACH  I used to be comfortable with it but now it feels totally wrong to me. Blood was shed to eliminate that word
@bamurphy760 @ESPN_FirstTake @stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless  right on
@BaySportsMom @ESPN_FirstTake I totally agree.  Casual use can actually de-sensitize the youth to the true origins of that word
@JeanetteJoy @funkalicious69  I loved Wolf of Wall st. but I need to see 12 years first
@DA_REALCOACH  I don't think the word can be legislated out but I personally stopped using it for fear that I'd perpetuate a stereotype
@WavesAudioLtd  absolutely love what I saw.  Watched video 2 three times.  Love the the new Waves direction &amp; attn to the consumer.  Props
@NBAFemale77 @ESPN_FirstTake  Amen
@DA_REALCOACH @ESPN_FirstTake @stephenasmith @RealSkipBayless  I'm not sure I agree
Damn "MetaFilter" by @WavesAudioLtd  is insane.  Gonna download it now on the road and put it in da studio when I get back.  Love it!
@stephenasmith  @RealSkipBayless great debate on the "N" word.  Had me yelling at the TV.
@DanGibson520  is this the number that Mike gave me?
@Becky__Patten  I sneaked in.  :-)
So I emailed @WavesAudioLtd at 11:49pm Saturday night.  An actual person answered my question at 6:00am on Sunday (yes Sunday). Very Classy!
@funkalicious69 @JeanetteJoy  yes
@bvsedgodzayn  sup baby girl
@eLbeskoz  Wow. Photoshop is pretty good.  Lmao.  Ick
So @JeanetteJoy what was your pick for movie of the year?
@slick  will do
@desireeeking   That's wuzzup!   Very impressive. :-)
Watching @espn and that Cincinnati coach should be happy his players held him back.  Da ref was gonna whoop dat arse.  LOL. Great game
@103ryan59   Happy birthday bruh.  Hold young?
@Sander1Arts @meetiboy @Atmel  it's coming my brother
@ChristinaForce0  you caught me in nasty work clothes
@EricS80  Wow...  Resonate is one of my all time favs!   Thanks
@GSMastering nice!
@GSMastering  how'd it go?   Big shot callers came out?
@GSMastering  omg you wouldn't believe the tech nightmare I've had.  I hate upgrading.  Sorry man
@Lizzs_Lockeroom @lawdog1911  you know I do
@NotEvenChad  Essex
@AvidProTools  avid is doing a remote access now.
@AvidProTools  it still says 11 not HD but I did load HD and the drivers. PT10 sees all of my hardware
@Oren_S_Levy @AvidProTools  never had stuff like this happen.  Maybe I loaded HD over 11 and regular 11 trumps it?  Lost a  huge project
@AvidProTools  in the playback engine menu there is no HDX available.  Only PT agg.
After I do Viva Phoenix 3/7 I've been asked to do an after party. I initially said "no" they said "it's a strip club". I said "what time?"
@chrisburlingame :-)
@DJGirl6 @necexposure   Great pic!!!  LOL
@blkthorobred @Lady_She  absolutely
Yo @Bootsy_Collins   You be good cool over there.  Ain't no rules!  Amsterdam has been dipped in da Fonk with a big P
@AvidProTools  So now I purchased PT11HD and it still doesn't recognize The HDIO's, 192's, Pre's or the D-Control.  My studio is shut down.
@MissDestructo @Giffdev @eliasisrael @omglazerkittens  ass hunters
@eliasisrael @MissDestructo @omglazerkittens mmmmm@mm

Ridin with two chicks playin YALA by@MIAuniverse really loud!!!   Love her! #headnoddin
@MissDestructo @unmarketing don't know.  It's a runaway ass
@SadieSmithRoks @CanadianPitbull  the she'd be round.  No angle
@MissDestructo @unmarketing  that ass is a star.  Been in movies, TV and video
@AvidProTools I'm going to go forward with the purchase.  I'll see what happens on the other end.  Is the purchase immediately downloadable?
@AvidProTools  I have sessions this week, so I'll buy the HD upgrade again &amp; hope it's immediately downloadable.  G,S&amp;B will call Avid soon.
@AvidProTools  Order ID:  4055170
@Christo333666  I saw that. @llcoolj is the man
@AvidProTools  yes I did.  I sent an email to store support but....
@Jasondcall @Avid @AvidProTools  I'm setup. It was just going from 10HD to 11HD.  Waiting on a "digital response" is pissing me off.  Thanks
@Avid @AvidProTools so why can't my ilok license for PT11 be deleted &amp; move the money over to PT11HD?  I've only spent over $250K with em.
@crazytone40 @ItsFlo @Cheesecake  congrats bro!!!!
@MInnisDixon right on man.  I'm a big @numanofficial fan.  Thanks
I love @Avid @AvidProTools products but for some reason when I make a purchase its like pulling teeth.  Bought PT11HD and ended up with PT11
Hey @ItsFlo I thought you worked here so I came in and found out you actually own the place.  @Cheesecake http://t.co/XVzEox4arX
Does @ItsFlo from progressive secretly work at the @Cheesecake ?  Hmmm
@D_Girl22 @ArsenioHall  great question.  It has a history.  It was once shot down on Sunset BLVD.  Then it went on a would tour.
The great @ArsenioHall allowed me to put a 40foot ass, smack dab in the middle of his stage in 1992.  You touched many careers bro.  Thanks
@Edawg206 @overvision @nastynes1  we didn't give a damn about a tux.  Lmao

@digiears @hackaday  I started dabbling with C++ but "jack of all trades master of none" came to mind.  I'm gonna get at it again though
@digiears @hackaday if I knew how to write code I'd really pump out some insanity.  I have some ideas for midi controllers
@DavidLDawes @TripleDoor @presidentsUSA  I'm working on it!!
@DavidLDawes @TripleDoor @presidentsUSA  I totally agree.  The lack of arrogance combined with pure talent is the perfect recipe. @Jasonfinn

@KingsFanInWA @AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio  that's how I see it also
@NotEvenChad @MadDogRadio   Lmao
@BLaGasa @AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio  lmfao.  I agree.  If I ever meet a guy named Sources, I will say "about time you came forward".
@BLaGasa @AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio  now "sources" say there was a racial slur.
@KingsFanInWA @AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio  I totally agree.  What did the fans next to him hear?
@AshleyLolaRyan @BLaGasa @espn @MadDogRadio  hmm.
@AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio   I hate to say it but I wish he would've gotten socked in his face if he said that
@AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio  they say he tweets crazy stuff also
@BLaGasa @espn @MadDogRadio  Agreed
@AshleyLolaRyan @espn @MadDogRadio OMG!!!!!!!  Are you serious?
@BLaGasa @espn @MadDogRadio  I totally agree but he must have cut really deep.
@nirvxlou @espn @MadDogRadio  that alone leads me to believe ..... Well you know

@Nick_and_Nate @kebmcorey @BeckyMegan2  yes sir
@Eels2Go  2 of those teams played in an era where headslaps  and QB hits were encouraged not only allowed. Hawks did it in the hands off era
@ashleyohcanada  you guys were great. Question is... Did my manager do at least 20% ??  I'll be back
@TerrenxMariex @niaacee  you guys were smiling and looking gorgeous
@adfskitteh @Seahawks  3 times.  It's better each time

Interesting listening to Scotty @MadDogRadio   Hard for him to admit the @Seahawks are the better team.  Kneel and kiss the ring homie.
