It's not OK to make this a purity test, and condemn anyone who thinks that's a dubious political strategy as a neoliberal shill. (And its also not OK to condemn single-payer types as radical socialists, although I'm not seeing much of that among Dems.) 4/
And many European countries achieve universal coverage with regulated/subsidized private systems, so that's a workable path. Now, it's OK to argue that we can go for all-out single payer and win, even if polling suggests otherwise 3/

Very good piece. Howard Schultz may be a fool, but he represents a real and dangerous phenomenon: plutocrats willing to undermine resistance to Trump unless they get to keep their taxes low. This isn't "centrism"; it's attempted blackmail
Actually it will be worse than that -- not whether reporters like them, but pronouncements about how voters will perceive their likability, brought to you by the people who keep interviewing Trump supporters in diners

Overall, however, I think the ability to live with high taxes, in both Stockholm and New York, is the important message. The idea that high taxes are a huge economic problem is supported by nothing except the interests of the people who want you to believe it 5/
On one side, this shows that the disincentive effects of taxes are much less than claimed; are high-income New Yorkers lazy and unmotivated? On the other, it says that the room for further rate increases may be less than some on the left imagine 4/
Plus sales taxes -- 4.5% state and 4% city -- also reduce the purchasing power of a marginal dollar earned. Put all of this together and high earned-income individuals (as opposed to capital incomes) pay a marginal rate of 55-60% 3/
I'd also point out that while the US federal top rate is only 37 -- it was 39.6 before the TCJA -- there are also state and local taxes. If you're a high earner in New York City, you pay almost 9% state and almost 4% city tax at the margin 2/

Well, gatekeepers and referees in public discussion need to try to avoid serving Upton Sinclairization. Every time CNN describe Stephen Moore as a "top economist"; every time cable TV highlights a climate denier as if he were an expert; they're feeding the malady 14/
Of course, Upton Sinclair economics is part of a broader phenomenon; the same thing poisons discussion of climate change, crime prevention, and more. So what can be done about it? 13/
Environmental degradation is being justified with claims about economic harm from regulation that are easily shown to be vastly overblown. Austerity policies in a depressed economy were justified with economic arguments that failed test after test 12/
And there's lots of other Upton Sinclair economics out there. All the work requirements and other hardships imposed on the poor are based on a theory of poverty that has been thoroughly refuted. 11/
Yet the usual suspects trotted out the usual arguments for the Trump tax cut -- and will not be deterred by the failure of that tax cut to deliver the investment or revenue booms they promised. Why not? Because they are, essentially, paid not to learn from experience 10/

In fact, the most important example of Upton Sinclair economics surely involved taxes, where the belief that tax hikes destroy economies and tax cuts work miracles survives no matter how many times it fails in practice 7/
I hereby propose we call this "Upton Sinclair economics", after the famous line "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it." And minimum wages are hardly the only example 6/
Why can't this issue seem to get settled? Because there are powerful, wealthy interests who don't want to accept what the evidence says. 5/
But there's steady drizzle of claims that minimum wage hikes do too kill jobs -- a sort of minimum-wage skeptic literature -- that continues no matter how strong the evidence gets. And the usual suspects predict disaster every time a hike is proposed 4/

So how much investment are we talking about? Private fixed assets are more than 200% of GDP. To get a 10% increase over 10 years -- which is what CEA claimed -- you'd need investment to rise by more than 2% of GDP (and that's probably an underestimate). 4/

Basically, disputes over trade can seem gentlemanly because economists, at least, mostly talk sense; disputes over macroeconomic policy can't, because they don't. Sad! 6/
Put it this way: you didn't have famous professors at Chicago denying comparative advantage, but you did have such people insisting on the validity of Say's Law and warning about phantom inflation. 5/
So writing and talking about monetary and fiscal policy necessarily has an edge -- a bit of ugliness, if you like -- that talking about trade doesn't. I don't see any way to avoid it: being nice about the macro debates would mean being dishonest with your readers 4/
The difference is that while people say dumb things about trade, you don't have a faction within the economics profession determined to support those dumb things. In macro, by contrast, prominent economists have been destructively ignorant and deeply partisan 3/

Exiting the customs union would still be costly, but not 8 percent of GDP costly. Meanwhile, you need to be realistic about what canceling Brexit would mean: it would still be the same old EU, with the same arrogance and intellectual rigidity. 7/

First, drop the hysteria about the costs of no deal. It's true that the complete absence of contingency planning means that a sudden end to the customs union would cause huge disruptions -- but that could still be avoided, and wouldn't last all that long 5/
You can see why the idea of a second referendum is gaining steam: voters were lied to, and they're starting to realize that. HOWEVER, if you're going to make the case for calling the whole thing off, you should do what Brexiteers didn't, and  be honest about the tradeoffs 4/
The "Norway option" would minimize the cost of Brexit, but would actually leave the UK with less sovereignty than staying in. The May deal would lead to less sovereignty and economic costs. Only a hardish Brexit would gain some control 3/
But I can't avoid Brexit entirely, so here are some thoughts about where it stands.  Simon Wren-Lewis's schematic picture of the options gets at the basics: the promises of the Brexiteers were nonsense, and now there's a tradeoff 2/ https://t.co/pRh2T7SEKF https://t.co/H5N8BBOlO6

That's not going to happen -- and even if it did in Fresno, that would just add another superstar metro, and do nothing for all the other left-behinds.  The point is that you can do a lot for the people in such locations -- give them health insurance, subsidize their wages 5/

Bad news: Canada has substantially lower productivity than the US. The biggest difference is in the service sector, which is hard to blame on the border effect. But also lower in manufacturing, which may have something to do with limited markets 2/
On Brexit, I've been thinking about what may be a useful model for post-Brexit Britain, another advanced country with formal free(ish) trade but not an open border with a much bigger neighbor: Canada. Good news: Canada isn't a wasteland. So hold the apocalyptic visions 1/

Now the government in Westminster is trying to throw up barriers to the rest of Europe -- but it doesn't want to unravel the peace in Ireland. And it's not having much success reconciling these goals. In a way, this reaffirms the EU's mission -- but it also shows the UK mess 8/
A key part of the settlement was the assurance that the border with the Republic of Ireland would stay wide open under EU rules, allowing Irish Catholics free access to their community to the south. It was about using economic integration to assure peace. And it worked 7/
And here's the thing: the Irish border illustrates the same logic in miniature. Northern Ireland had a terrible history of discrimination and violent opposition; there was a time when IRA bombings were almost routine 6/
The idea was that integrating a key industry across borders would create a mutual dependence that would prevent any future war. And that's been a running theme for the EU ever since 5/
European integration really began with the Coal and Steel Community, whose goal was to create an interdependent industry sprawling across the Franco-German border. This wasn't just about efficiency; it was also about peace 4/ https://t.co/ys49hBQoqS
This sounds like a strange issue to crop up. But actually the Irish border issue resonates deeply with the history of the European project, showing that the concerns that created that project remain relevant today 3/

Also also: we need to ask how much of the tax cut actually went to foreigners. Working on that. But early estimates suggested around 1/3. That's a lot. 4/

The GOP strategy depends on angry whites being essentially overrepresented by our skewed political system. And while that seems to be true of the Senate, it looks like it's no longer true of the House. Advantage Dems, probably for years to come fin/
Put it this way: no Democrat would ever think of basing a whole political strategy around hate and fear of rural whites, the way the Trumpified GOP bases its whole strategy around hare and fear of brown people. 10/
But doesn't this make the parties symmetric? No, because Rs play ONLY to their base. Trumpian posturing is aimed at those rural whites; Dems try to turn out minority groups, but also to appeal to suburban whites. 9/
This means that when you see things like Trump approval staying above 40 percent despite his awfulness, that number is being sustained largely by people who are not going to be swing voters in the House 8/
If anything, Rs have more wasted votes than Ds. And I think there's a story there, which bodes well for Democrats in the future. Basically, rural and/or southern districts are now as atypical of the nation as inner-city districts. And they vote R 7/
The story about structural R advantage was that the Dem hump on the left would be bigger than the R inverse hump on the right -- that is, more wasted votes in safe D than safe R districts. But what it actually looks like is this 6/ https://t.co/logcTENxMQ
Here's what I did: I ranked districts by Dem margin, then averaged them into five quintiles. For each I calculated the "excess" Dem margin -- the difference between the D margin in that group and in the nation as a whole 5/
but also because of population demography. So Dems would, the story went, have a lot of "wasted" votes in districts they were always going to win, while Republicans wouldn't. So what happened? I've been looking at the excellent Cook vote tracker 4/ https://t.co/1wP97kSuCm
This fear was reasonable based on history, when Rs often controlled House despite getting fewer votes. And there was a story behind it: concentration of minority voters in relatively few districts, party because of gerrymandering 3/
As I read it, the popular vote was more or less in line with polling, but Democrats did considerably better in seats gained than expected, belying the widespread fear  that even a large pop vote lead would leave the House in R hands 2/

But there is also no such thing as virtue, or heroism, or service -- all are defined in terms of what serves the Big Man. And I think that at some level debasing the Medal of Freedom is a conscious act -- it's a way of denying that you can be a good American who isn't Trumpian 3/
There's something deeper and uglier about it: it's another implementation of Trump's moral and epistemological relativism. In Trumpworld -- now indistinguishable from GOPworld -- there is no such thing as truth, only what serves his interests 2/

But it may well have cost Democrats a Senate seat in Florida. Great job, news media https://t.co/8HMx2zJEAA
If Democrats end up losing only 1 seat in the Senate despite a terrible map, while gaining almost 40 in the House, will the usual suspects still claim they fell short? Why, yes they will. https://t.co/oMvAQtRIsm

If Republicans get away with this now, you can be sure they'll do much more of it in the future. So this needs to be stopped: we can't afford to let it slide 3/
Even if FL and AZ have elected Democratic senators, Rs will still control the Senate. But the chance for a Democratic takeover in 2020 will be much better. That is not, however, the most important issue. Instead, it's about whether stealing elections is OK 2/
So Republicans are trying to stop the vote counts in Florida and Arizona -- that is, to steal those elections. We don't know if Dems will win if all the votes are counted, but they very well might. Why does this matter? 1/
The thing, I think, is that for today's conservative movement, as for Trump, someone decent is ipso facto unreliable: he might actually display a conscience, or care about professional ethics, in a crunch. And that's not a risk they want to run 3/
Partly it's because those are Trump's kind of people -- people a lot like him. But I also think it's a Republican thing. It's like the preference of the GOP for economic hacks, even though there are more respectable alternatives 2/ https://t.co/d0IbkLf37r
The guy Trump expects to save him from Mueller is a real piece of work. But then, so are most of his appointments -- not just hacks, but petty crooks and scam artists. Price, Zinke, etc. Why? 1/ https://t.co/wLO8dTpWyg
But, but the narrative always says that Dems are losers https://t.co/47xfUnUyoz
Luckily the stakes not as high this time around: Dem takeover of House was the crucial thing, and the wave was so high that barrier was cleared with plenty of room to spare. But in assessing that outcome, don't forget that it happened despite foul play of several kinds 4/
But now we're replaying 2000, with Rs trying to steal an election in Florida by stopping the vote count. (GA governorship clearly stolen, if Kemp gets in). Even so, Dems may hold Senate loss to only 1 seat. But without media collaboration and stolen votes, what would happen? 3/
Notice that the caravan totally disappeared as an issue as soon as the votes were cast -- not just Fox News, but mainstream media too. Guys, you really need to take a hard look in the mirror and ask why you're so easily played 2/
The midterms election feels like a mix-and-match combination of two ugly episodes from history. For weeks it felt like 2016: Rs created a fake issue -- the caravan playing the role of emails -- and the news media happily went along with it. 1/
When values divides play into deeply distorted representation, it's a problem https://t.co/X7wY6nT1cU
And Trump isn't a dictator, much as he might wish he were. He can tell federal officials not to talk -- but he can't tell private citizens, including fired prosecutors, not to testify when called by Congress. His defensive wall has been breached, bigly 4/
The thing is, with a Dem House Trump can't really kill the inquiry -- because now people with subpoena power can call Mueller and colleagues for testimony, and get the facts out anyway. In fact, this could be worse than letting Mueller finish and then sitting on the report 3/
Surely the plan was always to kill the Mueller investigation after the midterm. But this was probably envisioned as something to go along with a GOP House that would block all other inquiry. Trump's anger over the loss may have moved him to act without thinking things through 2/
Some midair thoughts (yes, I'm on airplane wifi, so this is all going v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y) on Trump/Sessions/Mueller. My first reaction on the replacement of Sessions with a complete hack was despair; but maybe needs to be rethought 1/
One thing I'm seeing, both out there and in some correspondence, is an amazing reluctance of the media to acknowledge that Democrats won big in the House. Bigger vote margin than 1994 or 2010; &gt;35 seat gain; but "Dems are out of touch losers" seems to be impervious to facts
Aha. Losing the House really limits Trump's ability to obstruct justice. https://t.co/nW0OeDUBI7

Interesting: during that brief moment when it looked possible that Republicans would hold the House, interest rates on US debt spiked. Party of fiscal responsibility! https://t.co/M7qwK27cF5
But even getting to that crisis is a big loss for Trump and a big victory for the resistance. The next two years will be terrifying, and may yet end in disaster -- but there's now a visible route out of the nightmare 4/
Of course, given who we're dealing with, it won't be that simple. The best guess is that when the Democratic House tries to exert its legal authority to subpoena records, the Trumpists will try to defy the law. A constitutional crisis is predictable 3/
You see, Trump didn't just need full control of Congress to advance his agenda. He needed it to shield the most corrupt administration in history from scrutiny. Now the wall of silence has been breached 2/
Americans of good will wanted a complete repudiation of Trumpism. They didn't get that: in some races, hatred, lies, and fear won the day. But Trump losing the House is a very big deal -- much bigger than it would be for a normal president 1/
So, I’ve landed in Germany, where the leader of the free world - Angela Merkel- is stepping down. I guess Nancy Pelosi will have to take her place.

I think this is part of a broader principle: fairly low-tech innovations can make a big difference in transit effectiveness. But of course NYC is a place where even affluent people use buses, making reform more likely 4/
The subway lines above the 50s all run north-south, so to get from the east side to the west or vice versa you either have to take a bus or make a circuitous route. The bus used to be painfully slow; now it's quite fast 3/
Seems like a simple thing -- but it's transformative, because the bus moves much faster, and doesn't lose lots of time as people pay. And the SBS service fills a major gap in Manhattan transit: going crosstown above midtown 2/

But I don't think it will work: he's abused his office so much, behaved so badly, that only his base sees him as presidential, and the cynical silliness of the stunt is obvious to everyone else. This dog won't wag. 8/
And Trump seems to believe that it will still work -- that he can get images of soldiers deploying to protect the border and that it will make everyone think of how strong a leader he is 7/
At the beginning, despite his manifest unfitness for office, Trump was also able to benefit from Presidenting theater. Every time he bombed someone, pundits eagerly proclaimed "Today Donald Trump became president" 6/
But after the bungled response to Katrina, a virtually identical image was seen as a demonstration of his lack of connection to suffering citizens. In other words, Presidenting theater is a limited resource 5/
But eventually the act wore thin, as disillusionment over the Iraq occupation and corruption scandals ate away at Bush's credibility. After 9/11, a photo of Bush on AF1 looking pensive was seen as an iconic image of the Great Leader 4/
And Bush the younger got huge mileage -- for a while -- out of playing Commander in Chief. Even Operation Flight Suit (remember that?), while inherently ridiculous, got a lot of favorable coverage at the time 3/
But it was always an exercise in theater. And I have some thoughts on that. You see, Presidenting Theater can be a very potent political tool. Reagan's political team didn't care what TV news said about him, as long as they got the flag-waving images 2/

So no, Pence didn't deliberately set out to offend every Jew in America. But this error probably wasn't an accident, either. My guess is that it had its roots in his religious extremism and ignorance of other faiths 3/

Yet the GOP, including supposed moderates (there aren't any in real life) bought int claims that the Trump tax cut would create so much growth that it would pay for itself. This party that doesn't let evidence get in the way of prejudices -- and invents conspiracies as needed 6/

And the conspiracy theorizing is itself part of an even broader attitude on the right: this is a movement that never accepts evidence that contradicts its preconceptions. Think about the way the GOP clings to belief in the magic of tax cuts in the teeth of experience 4/
After all, the deep state stuff comes from an ongoing right-wing meme. Also remember, it's more or less standard on the right to assert that thousands of scientists around the world are part of a conspiracy to fake evidence for climate change. 3/ https://t.co/WLlpv0DQ1W
And no doubt we'll see a lot of double-think: an individual's actions say nothing, and also he was a deep-state plant. In any case, it's really important to understand how predictable the false-flag claims were -- because conspiracy theorizing is central to the modern right 2/

The theory behind the tax cut was that it would unleash a huge wave of business investment, financed by massive capital inflows. And there's still no sign that this is happening: business investment as a share of GDP 2/ https://t.co/s4HXeh6deg
Reaction to the GDP numbers: quarterly growth rates don't mean much. For one thing they fluctuate a lot -- e.g. rapid growth in 2014, signifying little. For another, you can always juice the numbers for a few quarters by running big deficits. What about the long term? 1/
I have to admit that I wondered whether Trump and co would restrain themselves and act piously concerned. If they had, the usual enablers would have popped up and said, "Today, Donald Trump became president". But no. 2/

So saying that Denmark is poorer than the US, while not exactly false, misses what's really going on, which is different decisions about work-life balance. And given Denmark's superior performance on many quality of life indicators, is there good reason to say they're wrong? 5/

And the truth is that I would be even more cautious. But by historical standards Trump has nothing to complain about -- yet he manages to be aggrieved anyway. And the hard-money men of the right are remarkably silent 4/
And it has raised rates less than in previous recoveries, even though unemployment is very low. There were reasons for this: it didn't cut more in 2007-9 because it couldn't, having hit zero, and it's being cautious about raising rates bc it's worried about underlying weakness 3/
The Fed always cuts rates when the economy slumps, then raises them when it recovers. In fact, it cut rates no more in response to the 2007-9 recession than it did in the two previous slumps, even though the recession was much worse 2/ https://t.co/tcXKDv7TnG

And Obamacare was very carefully paid for -- which is why it didn't blow up the deficit. So by being cynical about "all politicians", you're actually failing to give credit where it's due, and thus enabling the bad guys. In other words, you're part of the problem.4/
Clinton and Obama were also both quite fiscally responsible -- maybe too responsible. Clinton oversaw a big fall in the deficit; Obama inherited a big deficit and an economy that needed deficit spending, but brought deficits way down thereafter 3/
In reality, both the Clinton and the Obama administrations were very honest on policy issues -- you can't, as far as I can tell, find any examples of gaslighting on the scale that is standard in today's GOP 2/

In short, you need something that looks a lot like Obamacare. And to my colleagues in the news media: we've been over this ground many times since 2010. There's no excuse for not getting it right after all these years 5/
Otherwise healthy people won't sign up, and premiums will be very high. So you need inducements to buy insurance: a mandate if possible, and subsidies to make it affordable to lower-income families. 4/
In other words, it was a scam. And the point actually goes deeper. If you want to protect pre-existing conditions, it's not enough to regulate insurers -- even if you do that effectively (which Rs didn't), you need a good risk pool 3/

Now, judging the tax cut by a couple of quarters' growth is stupid and/or disingenuous; but in any case we probably haven't seen the downside yet. The crowding out is still in the future 5/

It should be much less effective when you're near full employment (which the Fed believes we are, which is what matters) and the Fed will raise rates to block overheating. In that case it will cause crowding out of other spending 3/

Monetary doves may well be right; I'm one of them. But Trump is making the best case around for Fed independence, even when the Fed may be wrong 6/
So the Fed isn't a sacred body that mustn't be criticized. Indeed, it's OK for elected officials to weigh in on monetary policy. But such criticism is only legit if it isn't nakedly driven by self-interest. And everything Trump does is naked self-interest. 5/

But in the 70s and 80s that kept not happening despite huge price spikes. I remember people talking about "[Marty[ Weitzman's Law": the cost of alternatives to crude is 40% above the current price, whatever that price is 4/

And what about his righteous anger? My God: we've all seen Donald Trump in action, lying with abandon about even trivial things, then bursting into volcanic anger when called on his lies. Kavanaugh is clearly cut from the same cloth 6/
Kavanaugh's defenders have urged us to ignore what he may have done once upon a time, and focus on the man he is now. That's a bad criterion -- but even if you do that, the man he is now is a pathological liar, about matters great and small 5/
All of these are lies about the present; but he also clearly lied about the past, Ford aside.  He lied about what "Renate alumni" meant.  He clearly lied about his past drinking behavior: many former classmates say that he was a heavy drinker. 4/
He lied about what "boofed" and "devil's triangle" mean -- leading someone on Capitol Hill to try to edit Wikipedia after the fact.  He lied about whether he watched Ford's testimony on TV, claiming he didn't when reporters saw him doing just that. 3/
He lied about what others who may have been at the party said; aside from Mark Judge, none of them "refuted" Ford's account.  He lied about Judge, who did not submit an affidavit that could subject him to perjury charges, just a non-binding letter from his lawyer. 2/
The morning after: really depressing to see "she said, he said" headlines. She said; he lied. Not about what happened 35 years ago; he lied about recent events and provable facts about his past. The Times editorial doesn't even get at all of them 1/ https://t.co/aTG4HWxmwF

So Kavanaugh and R senators are just lying outright about what Ford's friends said. They didn't say it didn't happen, they said they didn't see it. This isn't a debatable point. They just believe that if they yell a lot the base will believe them.

What seems to explain the difference is incentives. Judges are political appointees; so a lawyer may find himself or herself facing a Federalist Society judge, creating an incentive to treat these people respectfully. Nothing comparable in econ 5/
But there's been nothing like the way law professors rushed to endorse Kavanaugh -- who got his career start pursuing conspiracy theories -- or the high reputation of Whelan, who seems to have been a crank all along 4/

What's different is how respectfully the judicial crazies have been treated by the non-right-wing legal establishment. Economists generally call cranks cranks, with some unfortunate exceptions; lawyers apparently don't 2/
A point some others have made: given Kavanaugh's record (sexual assault aside) and the Whelan stunt it's now clear that the right-wing judicial establishment is full of charlatans and cranks, to use Greg Mankiw's famous phrase about supply-side economics 1/
Their haplessness now reminds me of the security people in Westworld who keep shouting "Freeze all motor functions!" at murderous hosts. They just seem stunned that the stuff that used to work isn't, at least for now 5/
So experience has taught these people that crazy conspiracy theories work, or at least do no harm to their cause or careers. Why should they have expected this time to be any different? 4/
Benghazi plus emails definitely put Trump in the WH -- largely because so much of the mainstream media ran with it, making emails the biggest issue in campaign coverage. And of course Trump is a birther 3/

It will also be a test for the news media -- in fact, the test has already started. Will they accept R lies about health care -- because that's what they will be -- at face value, or at most say "some Democrats" say their plans won't do what they claim? 8/
So what's coming if Rs hold Congress will be a massive exercise in fraudulence: a bill that pretends to protect pre-existing conditions, but actually doesn't, and would cause millions of vulnerable people to lose coverage. That's not speculation, it's deduction 7/
Republicans will not come up with an alternative that still protects people with pre-existing conditions. I don't say this based on knowledge of what they'll propose, but because any plan that really protects PECs *has to look a lot like Obamacare* 6/
Republicans have killed the mandate, which has damaged the program -- but not as much as one might fear, because the subsidies limit premiums as a percentage of income for the majority of those signing up. So the ACA is still standing, if somewhat eroded 5/
A mandate requiring you to have insurance helps, but can't work unless you also provide financial aid to people with lower incomes to make sure they can afford the premiums. Obamacare did both of these things -- because that's what the logic required 4/
But even these steps aren't enough by themselves, because they can lead to a situation in which healthy people don't sign up, so you have a sick risk pool and prohibitively high premiums. So you need more: incentives for the healthy to buy insurance 3/
To make affordable insurance available for people with preexisting conditions, you need guaranteed issue -- insurers can't turn you down -- and community rating -- they can't charge you high premiums because of your medical history 2/

If (b), it's a big step toward all-out global trade war. Is this the plan? Probably not: they're backing themselves into it with a shoddily constructed agreement and lack of clear thinking 5/
Trump presumably doesn't care. But then the question: is the tariff (a) only on Mexico, or (b) global? If (a), this hurts Mexican production vis-a-vis European and Asian. Since Mexican cars contain a lot of US parts, this probably destroys US auto jobs 4/
Trump could block this by imposing a 232 -- that is, national security -- tariff on nonconforming Mexican auto exports. But this would be a travesty -- a clear violation of the spirit of international trade rules 3/
The deal appears to impose fairly onerous requirements on new Mexican auto plants if they want to qualify for tariff-free access to the US market. Bown suggests that Mexican producers would find it cheaper to ignore the reqs and pay the 2.5% tariff on non-NAFTA autos 2/

So many voters came away with the impression that Clinton was as or more corrupt than a guy who was more or less literally a mobster. This was a huge journalistic failure. And my impression is that all too many editors still don't get it 5/
It was the AP, not Fox News, that portrayed Clinton's meeting with a Nobel laureate who also happened to have donated to the Clinton Foundation as a major scandal. Meanwhile, Trump scandals tended to get one article, then fade from coverage 4/
Yet Trump's corruption and dishonesty were always obvious to anyone who dug even slightly. So how did he get away with it? The answer, surely, lies in mainstream media coverage -- in breathless reporting about emails etc. 3/
Remember, he also had an edge on perceptions of honesty. And these weren't just the Trump shoot-em-on-5th-avenue base, who aren't a majority; this has to have included a number of educated voters, including white women 2/

I don't know the answer, but it seems like an essential question to ask, because even if democracy survives Trump -- which is far from guaranteed -- the GOP is clearly ready to do it all over again 8/
And the question then becomes, why? America isn't or wasn't obviously a collapsing state; the GOP's supporters were hardly oppressed by historical standards (and its rich donors have done very well). So why this willingness to break all norms, including basic patriotism? 7/
So what's going on here? The record seems to say that the modern Republican party is something special: corrupt and disloyal not simply to a degree unprecedented in American history, but as far as I can tell, in all history. Am I missing something? 6/
And treason was a thing in ancient Greek city-states, typically collusion with the Persians. But Persia was a superpower, versus small Greek polities; colluding with a small power when your own country is far bigger is new in history, I think 5/
So my first question is, is there anything like this in history? Certainly not in America: we've had traitors, but never at this level. You can, perhaps, get a bit closer in some European experiences: some countries had fascist politicians colluding with the Axis pre-WWII 4/
And even more remarkable is the willingness of the whole Congressional GOP to go along with the obvious, ongoing betrayal of U.S. interests. Not one important players has offered anything more than a few sad tweets. 3/

Why the urge to destroy? Well, partly it's because it's what Putin wants. But I also suspect that the whole postwar system offends Trump's sense of how things should be. It was devised by elites -- the kind of people who, in his mind, have sneered at him his whole life 5/
The best hypothesis is that trade war and destruction of alliances aren't means to an end -- they are ends in themselves. Trump isn't trying to fix the system, he wants to destroy it, and supposed wrongdoing by others is just an excuse. 4/
There's probably nothing the Chinese could do that would satisfy Trump on trade; there's certainly nothing the Europeans could do, since they're no more protectionist than we are. Nor would, say, a rise in German defense spending calm the waters 3/
In both cases you go badly astray if you take Trump's claimed motivations and goals at face value. That is, trade war and disruption of the Western alliance are NOT bargaining ploys aimed at pressuring others into changing their policies 2/
Trump's assault on NATO and his assault on the GATT/WTO world trading system should be seen as being of a piece with each other 1/ https://t.co/nD749rAqaR

So yes, let's have better empirical work and more evidence. But I suspect that there will always be too much money at stake to truly depoliticize economics. 6/
But to a first approximation nobody has admitted being wrong about anything, let alone changed views in the face of overwhelming evidence. And a large part of this is politics: the more or less Keynesian view supported by the evidence is seen as too pro-government to accept 5/
So is macroeconomics really all that different? Yes, lack of experimental evidence makes it hard to pin down the effects of monetary and fiscal policy; but the experience of the past 10 years has provided enough evidence to clearly refute some views 4/
Why? For one thing, there's a lot of money at stake: skepticism about well-established science is good for the fossil fuel industry, so there's good money to be made in being a skeptic. 3/

So the only policy that makes sense for China is retaliation -- make this as painful as possible for Trump, and hope that this pushes him into either backing down or at least making comprehensible demands. Not saying they're good guys; but Trump not offering any useful options 6/
So what are the Chinese supposed to deliver? They don't even know what concessions might satisfy Trump, and have good reason to believe that nothing would do the trick -- after all, Canada is also in the crosshairs, and does nothing important wrong 5/
But (3) is just stupid: China would have large bilateral surplus even with balanced trade, because it's the Great Assembler of goods whose value added comes largely from other countries. Yet (3) seems to be what Trump mainly focuses on 4/
Meanwhile, (2) is far less important in, say, 2010: Chinese surplus smaller relative to GDP, and the U.S. is no longer at the zero lower bound with high unemployment, so demand drag from foreign surpluses less of an issue. Still, some case for shift in Chinese macro policy 3/
Of these, (1) is a real issue -- but should be addressed by a coalition of advanced countries, except that Trump is stirring up trade war with our allies too. And Trump has offered no specifics on what China should do 2/
Maybe worth laying out incoherence of Trump's trade war a bit more, um, coherently. There are three issues that seem to be flashpoints:  1. Chinese bad behavior on intellectual property 2. China's overall trade surplus 3. China's bilateral surplus with the US 1/

The answer is clear: nothing. 5.2% growth in the 3rd quarter of 2014 wasn't the signal of an upward breakout in long-run growth, just one of those fluctuations which are normal wiggles around the trend 4/
This tells us the economy's long-run growth rate, since unemployment can't fall without limit. Now, the Trump tax cut is supposed to raise long-run growth -- up to 3 percent or more over the course of a decade. What will one quarter tell us about that goal? 3/

I think it's a combination of mysticism and laziness. The less people know about international currencies, the more they seem to think they matter. And it's easier to talk about the special role of the dollar than about determinants of capital flows. Anyway, this is a bad take 4/
The pound, the loonie, and the Aussie dollar aren't reserve currencies; so it's really not about that. It's probably about low saving and relatively favorable demography. So why do people keep talking about the special role of the dollar? 3/

But it's actually worse than that. The banana war involved a US demand that Europe stop doing something it was actually doing -- granting heavy preference to bananas from former colonies. Trump trade policy is all about demanding that Europe end its "massive tariffs" 2/

Indeed. To the extent that there was a case for the 2017 tax cut, it was the claim that it would eventually raise real wages.

You could do what some of us do when we get it wrong: admit the mistake, and try to learn from it. But our emerging hack won't do that, perhaps because his ego is too fragile. Instead, he doubles down, trying to regain his footing by becoming even more dumbly contrarian 3/
This contrarianism always involves shocking liberal pieties, never conservatives. Funny how that works. Anyway, pretty soon it turns out that the contrarianism wasn't clever -- it was simply ignorant; the liberal pieties were there because they were, well, true 2/

So we're taking a protectionist plan that's already really bad -- partly because it will hurt employment in downstream industries more than it helps the protected sectors -- and making it even worse 6/ https://t.co/tlhMMaQaRn
Back when US costs of protectionism were fairly significant, those quota rents to foreigners -- especially the rents on apparel imports, restricted by the Multi-Fiber Agreement (don't ask) -- were actually the main cost of import restrictions 5/
If the US imposes a tariff, it at least gets the tariff revenue. If a foreign govt administers a quota, it -- or the firms it favors -- get the quota rents. So this is basically giving money to foreigners 4/
In the case of a tariff, the wedge between domestic and world prices is equal to the tariff. In the case of a quota, there's an equivalent "rent" -- what the right to sell a unit of the good to US would sell for. (Historically, there have even been markets for export rights) 3/
Why prefer a quota *administered by a foreign government* to a tariff? I mean, except for one qualification I'll get to shortly, a quota and a tariff that produce the same level of imports have the same effect on domestic prices 2/ https://t.co/qAZoA6bGFv

Doing some tax cut economics, and wanted to repost this chart from Greg @gregleiserson Trump administration is living in a different universe from independent analysts https://t.co/OztglU1kLN
Of course, this costs money, and requires higher taxes further up the scale. But there very little evidence that top tax rates in the US cause big incentive problems -- except for the incentives politicians have to cater to wealthy donors 7/
The other way is to make benefits fade out more slowly, as in the line labeled "Aid 3": benefits don't go away until you reach an income of 30K, so you only face a de facto marginal tax rate of 33%. I.e., making benefits more generous for the near-poor can improve incentives 6/
Anyway, suppose you want to reduce the disincentives. One way is to go to the line labeled "Aid 1": make benefits much lower, so that families only lose 1K for every 3K they earn. But this increases misery 5/
The problem with this program is that in effect it imposes a 67% tax rate on low-income families: for every 3K they gain in income, they lose 2K in benefits. Actual poverty programs do this to some extent, although not for very low incomes where EITC actually rises with income 4/
Here's the chart 3/ https://t.co/OvkvetQ8gW
Imagine a simplified poverty program that gives low-income families aid that depends on their income. In the chart below, think of this program as the red line labeled "Aid 2": it gives families with zero income $10K, but fades out and is eliminated by the time you reach $15K 2/
In today's column I point out the many ways Trump and his allies in Congress are attacking the poor. But there's one point I probably didn't explain well enough: how we can improve incentives by making aid *more* generous, not less 1/ https://t.co/Iaj64TwOPV
And it's worth noting that the case for low taxes on the rich is *strongest* at the state and local level, where rich people might move. At the national level it's even weaker -- has to rely on incentive effects that are nowhere to be seen 2/

And the pathetic thing is, none of it worked -- not for him, not for any of the long list of economists Quiggin cites. None of this group was rewarded with a major policy position; instead, Trump went for Kudlow and Kevin "Dow 36,000" Hassett. 4/

The terrible thing, of course, is that these hollow men have real power now, and their neediness will do immense damage to the world 4/
And this is obviously true of Trump himself -- he's the one who sets the tone for the whole administration. It's not even about power or wealth, except insofar as these buy validation. It's about humiliating and lording it over people to numb your inner emptiness 3/

I've been cynical about the state of conservatism for a long time, but even I find it hard to wrap my mind around this -- not to mention the corruption of conservative media, evangelicals, and more. With this much rot, you really do wonder how the republic survives 4/
But they're running cover for him anyway -- with not one serious dissenter. So we're looking at a whole party so addicted to power, so determined to serve donors' interests, that it's essentially willing to condone treason. Trump is a symptom of a much deeper rot 3/
Surely the vast majority of Rs in Congress have privately reached the same conclusions as anyone reading the news: Trump is deeply corrupt, his campaign colluded with a foreign power, and he may well be subject to blackmail that is shaping US policy 2/

Which is why retracing Comey's errors isn't a waste of time https://t.co/oVtQ5kRd4P
Let me also say that a lot of the news media essentially played the same game -- let's rag on Hillary to show our "balance", because what could possibly go wrong?
Yes, Comey effectively threw the election to Trump in what he thought was a cost-free way to appease the right. Saying this isn't sour grapes or a refusal to move on -- because it will happen again if we don't face up to the reality now https://t.co/L8RyD8GsiW
Anyway, this does seem as if one particular kind of policy scam has reached the end of its road 4/
This is somewhat different from the Bush tax cuts, which were fairly popular. Interesting to ask why. The crumbs are even smaller? Years of deficit-scare rhetoric have made the public more skeptical? Anything with Trump's name attached is devalued? 3/
If anything the tax cuts are getting less popular over time, despite low unemployment 2/ https://t.co/YadJSZKIOe

Oh, and Republicans in Congress have also made it clear that no scandal, financial or otherwise, will cause them to break with Trump. So what can Putin possibly have? 4/
I mean, by now it's clear that key Trump support groups don't care about any of it. In particular, evangelical leaders have made it perfectly clear that his personal morality doesn't matter; they'd stick with him if there was video of ... actually, use your imagination 3/
I mean, let's be realistic: everything, and I mean everything, indicates that the president of the US is a Russian puppet; it almost has to be blackmail. But then the question is, blackmail with what? What could be worse than what we already know? 2/
I've been pretty much staying out of the Trump scandal business, bc it's being well covered by other people, and I think I add more value added by concentrating on my comparative advantage. But I remain deeply puzzled by Putin's obvious hold on DJT 1/

If experience is any guide, soon the media and the professional centrists will find another right-wing intellectual hero. And he will also be a complete, obvious fraud 6/
The trouble is that to say this -- to have a list of major ideas and major thinkers that contains no currently active conservative ideas or Republicans -- seems "unbalanced". Ryan was credited with virtues he didn't at all possess to try and fill this gap. 5/
That was in the late 1980s -- and it was accepted on the left while becoming anathema on the right.I may be missing some other ideas, but I don't think any major ones. And the reigning orthodoxy on the right consists of known falsehoods 4/
The truth is that there has been a long dearth of interesting policy ideas on the right. The most recent I can think of is Stuart Butler's concept of universal health coverage via mandates and subsidies -- a Heritage idea that became Obamacare 3/

In fact, the amazing thing is how little spending has risen -- the modest additional costs from Obamacare were more than offset by the slowdown in Medicare spending. 5/
True, spending is now slightly higher than before the crisis. But that's basically demography: with retiring baby boomers, you expect more spending on Social Security and Medicare (the US govt is an insurance company with an army) 4/

So Trump attempts to push Obamacare into a death spiral, while they have hurt the program and slightly rolled back the improvements in coverage, have also turned it into a program that looks more and more like government insurance rather than a regulated private market

If you try to put an economic value on the sickness and death caused by pollution, the numbers are huge; but if officials get a green light to be corrupt, they'll cheerfully impose those costs to raise a few companies' profits 6/ https://t.co/AyXcqKeyWV
So if we let environmental officials get away with personally profiting from lobbyist connections, you're going to have a pronounced pro-pollution bias -- and this will be true even if the social costs of their laxness are vastly larger than the benefits 5/

you just can't find honest, informed defenses of many ideas that are GOP doctrine. So news orgs have a choice: give hacks equal representation with real experts, or present an "unbalanced" picture that acknowledges that some things just aren't true. 8/
The point is that all this happened long before Trump -- which means that the attempt to offer "balance" essentially requires intellectually shortchanging readers. Economics surely has more good researchers who are also conservative than many subjects. But even so ... 7/
But the major right-leaning think tanks aren't in that business. The Heritage Foundation is a spectacular example: its hackery and inability to get basic facts right mean that nothing it says can or should be taken seriously 6/ https://t.co/hCnte39Eer
This is also why viewing Washington as an arena of contending think tanks is actually false equivalence. Center-left institutions like EPI, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and so on really do research: they have an agenda, but care about facts 5/
Yet supply-side economics still shambles along, eating politicians' brains. Why? Because the doctrine serves the interests of the GOP's paymasters. That is, the politics drive the ideas -- which is also why conservatives are still saying the same things they said 30 years ago 4/

As a result, whatever impulses toward decency may remain among, say, Republican senators are overshadowed by their fear of the Trump-loving base. Which is, in turn, why we are so vulnerable to a constitutional crisis 9/
Second, the party's base will disproportionately consist of the easily conned. And this explains why Trump, who looks to most people like a dangerous buffoon, dominates the GOP so easily: he's a crude con man, and the party's base loves him for it 8/
First, the party's politicians will disproportionately include people who are both willing to engage in con games and good at it -- i.e., con artists. Not saying that there are no con men on the D side, but there's hardly anything else on the R side 7/
But there are other implications of this kind of analysis. If a party's political strategy rests fundamentally on a con game, there will be a selection bias among both politicians and voters -- one that's very visible here in America 6/
That is, to do away, de facto at least, with democracy. This could mean full-blown authoritarianism, but it could involve gerrymandering, disenfranchisement, etc.. A lot of this has already happened in the US, where Dems need a 7 or 8 point popular margin to take the House 5/
What Simon argues is that this con game is always fragile -- the public might catch on (special indications indicate that GOP attempts to kill health care for millions are taking a big toll on the party). So the right has strong temptation to cheat 4/

Which is why the European Union, which seems to be Trump's current focus of enmity, has also seen a steady decline in manufacturing as a share of total employment 7/ https://t.co/sWRUQ1trSq
Not saying that trade had no role; over shorter periods, like the surge in deficits under Bush, it was a big factor in absolute changes in mfg employment. But over the long run manufacturing decline reflects forces much bigger than trade 6/
First-pass estimate would be a comparable increase in employment. So we'd be talking about raising manufacturing from 8.5% of employment to maybe 9.8%. We'd still be overwhelmingly a service economy, nothing like we once were 5/
But a dollar of trade shift in manufacturing would add much less, maybe 60 cents, to manufacturing value-added, because mfg uses a lot of service inputs. So were talking about maybe 1.8% of GDP added to mfg -- or about 15% more than now 4/
But how much does trade have to do with this decline? The US used to run roughly balanced trade; now it runs a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP. If that deficit were closed, most of the shift would be in manufacturing 3/ https://t.co/p6Z2m67I84

Back of the envelope math: we spend about $90 billion on steel products. If a tariff raises that by 25% -- yes, it would raise prices for domestic as well as foreign steel -- that's about $150 per worker. Remember Paul Ryan touting a teacher's $75 tax cut?

OK, you get my point: Republicans didn't go off the deep end in 2017, or even after Obama was elected. The moral and intellectual rot goes back at least a generation; it's just that people pretended not to notice 5/
They didn't take their cues from Breitbart; they relied on respectable media organizations like the Drudge Report 4/
Significant figures in the party didn't peddle conspiracy theories about high school students and other victims of gun massacres; they discussed substantive issues like Hillary Clinton's murder of Vince Foster 3/
I mean, back then the GOP wasn't led by a personally repellent vulgarian, it was led by fine upstanding open-minded gentlemen like Newt Gingrich. 2/
One thing I'm seeing among moderate Republicans -- there are maybe two dozen of them, none in Congress, but are fairly prominent in the commentariat -- is nostalgia for the 1990s, which they remember as a far better era. And you can see why 1/
Because a twisted, gerrymandered system effectively disenfranchises tens of millions of Americas. Isn't it great living in the world's greatest democracy? 3/

It's also, but the way, what you'd expect if a large fraction of taxable profits represents monopoly rents rather than return to capital. And in that case, there will be very little trickle down. This will be a tax cut for the wealthy, full stop 4/

So Trump won't produce a real infrastructure plan because he doesn't dare employ anyone who would know how to do that. 8/
Or because people who actually know what they're doing in any field other than propaganda -- be it defense, diplomacy, science, economic policy -- might, you know, turn out to have independent minds and even consciences. They're dangerous! 7/
After all, a real infrastructure plan means deciding what needs to be built; it requires that somebody in the administration have some professional expertise. And this admin actively hates employing such people, either because they weren't loyalists in the past 6/
One answer may be that much of the Congressional GOP hates doing anything that might convey the impression that government is good for something. But I have a personal theory that something else is going on: Trump is terrified of trying to make actual policy 5/
And given a complaisant Congress, he could waive lots of rules and turn infrastructure into a big profit center for cronies, very much including his own family. So why is there nothing here but a big fat zero? 4/
The interesting question is why he won't go for a few hundred billion in actual stuff. I mean, he could get some credit from voters; he could stick his name on things (plenty of past politicians have had edifice complexes for that very reason) 3/
Furthermore, his budget slashes $178 billion in transportation funding, billions more from water, energy, and so on. So the real net spending on infrastructure being proposed is basically zero. All that's left is an effort to privatize things that can make profits 2/
Journalists need to stop talking about Trump's "huge", "$1.5 trillion" infrastructure plan. He's only proposing $200 billion in federal money, which is somehow supposed to jumpstart almost 8 times as much total spending 1/

Fundamentally, Germany just has low overall spending; it maintains full employment only thanks to that surplus, but the surplus creates big problems for others, mainly in Europe.

Let me add that German differences didn't matter too much when Germany was a small player. But they've become a real problem given Germany's role in the eurozone

One key lesson of 2017 was that everything liberals have said about right-wing hypocrisy was true -- in fact understated 1/ https://t.co/o9Le1y7Sau
Opponents of clean energy used to pretend it was about letting the free market work. Now they openly call for subsidizing polluting energy sources, and actively try to harm renewables https://t.co/8rOW6JCtlJ
The Koch brothers get a great return on their political investments https://t.co/w4aVp2tEaQ
For what it's worth, however, the weakness of the dollar -- now well below its pre-election level -- is a pretty clear sign that markets don't believe in a Trump boom as opposed to being generally optimistic about world growth 3/ https://t.co/A3FSO8OXt2
If I remember correctly, Bill Clinton once idly remarked that a weaker dollar was good for exports; he was just showing off his economic knowledge, but markets freaked out. If you're a senior official, you just don't say that sort of thing 2/
I suspect that this isn't an economic strategy, it's just idiocy. 1/ https://t.co/nssDtYkeDf
Many tributes today to Ursula Le Guin, and deservedly so. For some reason not seeing many mentions of The Dispossessed, which had a big impact on my thinking about society
Partly this reflects the view that what's good for the Koch brothers is good for America. But I also think it's a macho thing: real men pollute the environment, and anything else -- solar and wind, but even relatively clean natural gas -- is for sissies 3/
This administration hates renewable energy. I don't mean that it hates subsidizing it -- it goes far beyond that. Remember, Rick Perry tried to push a plan that would have forced users of other energy sources to subsidize coal and nuclear 2/  https://t.co/IiKDBqrZMN
The solar panel tariff will almost certainly kill more jobs than it creates. But that's a feature, not a bug 1/ https://t.co/TGv3dm3XW8
Meanwhile, we're on the road to really bad monetary policy ,,, https://t.co/7tuBTtCC74
This has been more or less universal among inflation derpers. As Binyamin says, the refusal to concede mistakes is much worse than simply making a mistake, which everyone does sometimes. https://t.co/nptJcyUDZY
I've probably had more experience than Chris with profoundly alienating meetings, but agree. Unless you're there to interview movers and shakers, no point I can see to going. https://t.co/sp6VL9NQYU
In fact, I did say exactly the same thing a month ago 2/ https://t.co/iDCvDLP9rm
Agree totally with Jim Tankersley here: even if you believe the most optimistic case for tax cuts, it should take time. I would have said the same thing 1/ https://t.co/tbCqTMzqj5
This happens to me now and again, but so far it has never involved a missile alert https://t.co/rWgatMd0tf
Refusing to take any action on opioids is both indefensible -- thousands will dies unnecessarily -- and politically puzzling. It would take so little to make a difference, and Trump etc could claim credit too https://t.co/jpaxJCTTIW
This is brilliant https://t.co/wgE9Ohus2D
If McConnell breaks his promise, if Trump vetoes the CR, that's all good news for the Dems. I admit that activist complaints are useful -- they will help keep spines stiff -- but let's be real 3/
They also didn't fund the wall, and they didn't agree to any new restrictions on family-based immigration etc. And what they gave in return was three (3) weeks of funding. Why will their leverage be any less on Feb. 8th? This looks to me like a tactical victory. 2/
I yield to nobody in my desire to see Dems stand up to Trump. But I really, really don't understand the notion that they somehow just caved in. They took CHIP off the table; they got an agreement to hold a vote on DACA, and failing to honor that agreement will be bad for Rs 1/
https://t.co/cIjywP9lX0
Also no link to wall or changes in legal immigration, at least so far
I just don't see this as a Democratic cave. Maybe you can argue that a prolonged shutdown would somehow get DACA now now now. But what they got was CHIP extension, a promise to get legislative play for Dreamers, and a chance to call foul in 3 weeks https://t.co/Z6LkZqdAiX
Yes, how I see it. Not really a cave, although there will be a real cost to Dreamers over the next three weeks https://t.co/KKjSeJ0V1p https://t.co/xWRsZ5MIyx
