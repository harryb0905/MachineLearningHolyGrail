@MaevriPlays Yeah! I haven’t seen this trailer, but I played the beta for a bit and am excited to see how it turns out!
@TomRyanOGRE2 @Courtknee66 @MLGPuckett What a boss! Thanks for the carry @Courtknee66!
@TheSimms Happy birthday! Going to celebrate you today by playing Halo as poorly as I can.
@PUCKETT111 !!! I haven’t seen that shirt in years!
@dmaq1 @MLGPuckett @KamronQuinn @TheLegendP @BrandonDefy @NickBesTMaN @masoncobb I’m out of town in Charlotte that weekend :(

@TheSimms See you soon, bro! &lt;3
@OlManMakowski *in Pac voice* MAKOWSKI
@KarmahTV Awwww yeah! Let's game some OW when I'm not on the road!
@ErnieSilvestri Didn't consider Honduras, let's jump on a call and you can tell me why it's a must visit!
@Greenskull Might have to happen!
@WARDOG &lt;3
@MLG_DarkFenix Of course! See you there!
@DaveAPyper @EvadLOL There was no way I was getting out of that crosshair
@akawyf @UGCmatt Will let you know if I end up in Toronto. Otherwise I'm sure I'll catch you at another event soon!
@walkerb Thanks! Let's get together when I'm back in town next week!
@DaveAPyper Possibly!
After 2+ years at First Strike Games, I’m moving on and excited to start writing the next chapter. For the first half of 2019 I’ll be traveling, reading all the books on my backlog, and supporting the HCS grassroots events! https://t.co/5eiHgvodk1
@PINPOINTASSOC @ronnochamilton @MLGPuckett @Halo @MLGSundance @ScottGandhi Didn’t know that! Was it playing well before the server crashes started happening?
@MLGAwkward @GamersOutreach I’ll see you there!
@MLGPuckett @MrBitterTV @Halo @MLGSundance @ScottGandhi Definitely come out so I can body you in Halo and Melee!
@theRealShooKon3 @W0lfyZero @Brav @Joe_Fries Happy New Year! Maybe we can link up when we get back to Bangkok!
@DevilVeteran59 @Halo @ProximittyCE @343Postums @Unyshek Happy belated bday!
@NickBesTMaN One of these days! We have stories that need to be told!
@Lovedeep87 @Halo Maybe!
@LcevoIx @DanRyanOGRE1 @TomRyanOGRE2 @masoncobb @JacobHysteria @SKHalogod @iGotUrPistola @StrongSide @bravo Merry Christmas! Hope all is well!
I'm known for backing up my trash talk, can Racks say the same? Appreciate @Complex and @Battlefield for making it happen, go check out the videos now! #Promo https://t.co/IDDzHtdaNP
@koush Will hit you up when I get back! I’m out of town until Jan 15th.
@LEGIQN Nice!! Did you crush it?
@TeamBeyondnet @ASTROGaming @Halo What a run! Thanks again for hosting all these online events!
@Chen @TomRyanOGRE2 @shibbyrw Looking forward to seeing you next in 2023!
@TravisForrest1 Haven’t been streaming. Maybe will turn it back on one of these days!
@rittsdope Whoa, 10 years ago! Thanks for the throwback!
@BrittonSkinner Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you were playing with a fake. I wasn’t gaming last night.
@akan907 Hope to catch you again soon!
@Cylical @KMaddify @itsBiiTTERSWEET I WANT TO PLAY THIS AGAIN!
@VinceTheKoala @MicrosoftStore Great meeting you!
@Schlayygs Will let you know soon!
@Mikwen The floor is lava
@Falloutt @masoncobb @JacobHysteria @RR0XY @DeRsKeezY I won’t be competing, but I might swing by and check it out!
@TheSimms Our casting has evolved over the years, but has always been a blast. I’m sure we’ll be on the mic together again soon!
@Nadeshot @100Thieves @slkeene @redbullesports @tom_nguyen_ Congrats my man! Well deserved for you and your org.
@aYo_MattBurns Hahaha!
@KarmahTV We do work during most OW games! Can only do so much!
@AKut47 Great seeing you again!
@minimightymouse @TheSimms You are too sweet. Always happy when I see your positivity in my Twitter feed!
@theRyanBateman @TheSimms @HCS That was so good! Please take Simms’s spot, I’ve been trying to get rid of him for years!
@minimightymouse Haven’t seen you yet this weekend!
How about that Roy double kill?
@KarmahTV LET’S GO!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!!!
@sharkybait @TheSimms Thanks! Was the tournament being streamed in the store all day?
Time for some Halo 3 on the main stage! https://t.co/qX0jLwhqJK https://t.co/R6ay7dslL4
@KarmahTV GET IT!!!!!!!!!
@oLGv_Sway @OpTicH3CZ @redbullesports I have signed two Shamwows over my Halo career.
@TomRyanOGRE2 Too late
@OpTicH3CZ @redbullesports &lt;3 Hecz
Up next we have Reciprocity vs Mentality! https://t.co/65clhRTnO0 https://t.co/B6xuKdvhi5
@TheSimms We’ll make it happen!
@FearSmth @KarmahTV It’s up now
@KarmahTV You got this!
@JessHawk36 @astro_halo @Trevor_McKinley @NorthSnipes_ Good seeing you there today and congrats on the win!
Happy Haloween! https://t.co/RYKqkmdM6q
@MuggsyLT At least you made sure I was in the right room this time! #willneverforgetPAX2018
@Tashi343i Thanks for having me! See you soon!
@DaveAPyper Maybe one of these days! Crazy busy lately.
Quick Halo chat https://t.co/TkYzfBAiia
@TomRyanOGRE2 3/3 National Championships. I took care of it this morning, Tom. https://t.co/k3HuW6TGKI
@Tashi343i @Fwiz Killer Queen is the best! Will you have the cab before I’m at the office in December, Ryan? Would love to run some games!
@MLGHoLic Nice insta and sick clip!
@TheMKB_ We have a full QA team right now.   You can apply on careers-&gt;general inquiry so you can be considered when a spot opens up!  https://t.co/61PVDKzgWq
@hastr0 Congrats!
@Flash_Potential Not really into streaming right now, but maybe sometime in the future!
@JAMALLICKTHECHE @Spavvner Hahaha! Appreciate the random shoutout!
@DatDudeDiesel10 Thanks!
@aagold3 👎 I’ll get you one of these times!!
We took 4th place yesterday in the MCS Finals Killer Queen tournament. Wanted to place higher, but I was happy with how we played! https://t.co/rjCC7Xp8GY
@MagW0lf @KillerQueenGame @killerqueenblk Come say hi!
@koush @KillerQueenGame @killerqueenblk We’ll play it when I get back in town!
I’m playing in a Killer Queen tournament today! Check it out and learn about this awesome game before it comes out on Switch and Steam at the end of the year. https://t.co/8tKzcJjgSw https://t.co/9Yt7fQe9I0
@TheOnlyZoltan @Tashi343i @HCS @HaloDataHive @PROVERBDR @MrAustenRoberts @joshua_menke @StressJS @DMusa_ @Wonderboyo @TomRyanOGRE2 @TheSimms @Spartan @DeRsKeezY @masoncobb @GH057ayame @jamesbachici @ChrisCovent @KnightysKnight @TheShyWay I’ll have to watch it and check it out!
@OpTicMaNiaC @Mikwen @JoshDiesToday @GH057ayame @joshua_menke @Moses_FPS @NorwenSLG I don’t think automatics are/were the only problem. Just giving my vague two cents on that topic. I need to write multiple pages to talk about the changes I would have attempted if I was a designer with influence there.
@Mikwen @JoshDiesToday @GH057ayame @joshua_menke @Moses_FPS @NorwenSLG To be clear. I think automatics should be in the game, I just think they should have done less damage and have significantly higher auto aim.
@Mikwen @JoshDiesToday @GH057ayame @joshua_menke @Moses_FPS @NorwenSLG Agreed. They implemented automatics with the hope of appealing to casuals, but they were too tough to use. Instead the autos were in a middle ground that was too low for top players and too high for casual players.
@Holzn3r No plans to any time soon.
@LEGIQN And now our ice cream adventures make 25-year-old you cackle like a mad man.
@Tashi343i Ball has so much influence on spawns! I remember Side showing me that back in the day.
@Tranmobile_ @Frodan Guardian Ball was one of the best map/mode combos for sure! Btw - miss you both!
@Frodan Pit was incredible! Would have been even better if the BR did more damage long-range. Sword-side of the map was pretty weak unless you had sniper.
@kr4ven11 Definitely miss parts of it!
@TheSituJAKEtion @OpTicMaNiaC Oops
@aagold3 I put soooo many hours into H3! No regrets!
@DatDudeDiesel10 Dress up as Cortana if you really want to throw me off my game.
@KnightysKnight @ShaneisMC Double-reloads...
@Biz_Ounce I enjoyed Halo 2 more, but Halo 3 definitely had a higher skill cap shot-wise. It was a step in the right direction and had a lot of replayability.
@ShaneisMC Can agree and say that online play with bloodshots were infuriating. LAN was great though.
Halo 3 is one of the best in the series. Insta-splodes with Plasma Grenades was my favorite mechanic that came out of this game. https://t.co/AuS2Vq6dLE
@FragDVixXen @MLG Whoa! Almost 10 years ago, thanks for throwback!
@TeamBeyondnet @TappingButtons Clutch win
@Nadeshot @fourzerotwo @II_UnLiMiT3D_II @Ninja @redbullesports @FortniteGame People like Ninja and Nadeshot took gaming and fame to a whole new level. Happy to have helped play my part and lay down some foundation.
Congrats to Tox for taking 1st place at HCS London! https://t.co/xRELOmK5W0
@PhoebeRoxz Thanks! Was great meeting you too!
@MrJDHYoung @OnFireMoses I don’t live in GR anymore, but I sure miss it!
Just a couple of guys from Grand Rapids, MI talking about Halo and Counter-Strike in London. https://t.co/ig1l5a6BbZ
@OpTicMaNiaC Room #?
@aagold3 @ChrisBaldwinter @NandosUK We call this an upgrade in the casting world. Aaron is the best KQ caster and is going to kill it out there this weekend!
@TylerMoloney @ChrisBaldwinter @TheSimms @NandosUK C’mon, you know I’ll be at BumbleBash!
Best conversation I’ve ever had with my friend, @GoldenboyFTW. https://t.co/D050CVI0fz
@MikeManns1 Thanks for the kind words!
@ChrisBaldwinter @TheSimms @NandosUK Really wish I could be at Hive Hustle! Unfortunately fell on the same weekend as HCS London and Halo takes priority.
@iTz_BRuZeR Was nice to meet you too!
Nice to meet you too! Thanks for coming out to the event! https://t.co/91ii64kzQz
@DanGheesling @TheSimms This is out in London!
@Jump_ @TheSimms Will be missing you out there, Bil!
@TheSimms I fly out tomorrow! Good times will be had!
@masoncobb I’ll see you Saturday
@LcevoIx @TomRyanOGRE2 @iGotUrPistola @StrongSide Sorry to hear you’re in this position right now, but I’m sure UW has a great staff and will take care of you. Wishing you a safe stay and a speedy recovery.
Red Bull’s first esports LAN. One viewpoint, one webcam, and it got more views than anyone expected. https://t.co/5MMf6GFhew
@sharkybait @Tsquared Maybe can tell our stories one day! Thanks for showing interest.
@JustSnipes @CatamyKX @TheCleanerHD We were crushing!
@JamesFuryNH @NeighborHeroes @MoxBoarding Won’t be able to make it in that time window, but might be able to swing by if it runs later.
@SighDefect @masoncobb @MoxBoarding How late will it be running? I’m meeting up with a friend in downtown Seattle and wouldn’t be able to swing by until much later.
@NeighborHeroes @KillerQueenGame Nice to game with you all last night!
@StudioMDHR Happy to be one of those purchases! Thanks for making a great game! https://t.co/39Ge3QPCsh
@RANKWlSE No exact formula, but playing in free money events that https://t.co/pFhfrgrce7 has been hosting lately is a good start. Otherwise grinding matchmaking and getting ranked high in the playlist will give you opportunities to play pros when they are searching.
Blast from the past! https://t.co/fKhlefBcJm
@xD1x Shot registration was an insane improvement, and that got me excited since most of our time playing is online. However, the core mechanics and gameplay was not great. I rank Reach below Halo 1/2/3.
@ZachWigal @MartinOmes Happy birthday, Martin!
Send them over! Those are super old school! https://t.co/ShEYE6Hvhs
@NickBesTMaN That’s the plan! I heard you and Neighbor might be playing in the H3 2v2 - is that true?
@xXKillerBuzzXx @HCS That is happy winner right there! Congrats again on winning and I now realized that I have to give flak to every people who wins so that they'll tweet me a photo after they get their prize!
@WarrrrN @MrAdamAp @MLG Thanks man! I'm not as responsive online, but I always make sure to spend time and talk to people when I'm at the events.
@MrAdamAp @MLG That's incredible! I never get tired of hearing how someone was positively influenced.
@NickBesTMaN @ComedyCentral @realjeffreyross Kills it, as always. Is the rest of the roast worth watching?
@Coinsultive Haven’t played it :(
@HCS_Takedown Saiyan came up with the team name.
@joel12p Hahahaha! One of the rare times where I actually caught it! I almost took the pole from my Dad when he hooked his fish though.
@TheAlabamaBoss And break the rules at the lake? Absolutely not!
@GoldGloveTV 172 days. And it was worth it.
@BertTheBigHurt I don’t know where to get them any more!
Final Bass https://t.co/gGev32MxDk
@David44868483 Not entirely sure which content piece you’re thinking of.
@FlagzTV No clue where pictures might be. At this point I’d probably have to go searching online.
Casting Tox vs Renegades with Goldenboy! https://t.co/qX0jLwhqJK https://t.co/PQtXmrnDAT
@mainev3nt @GoldenboyFTW @Splyce Eat my shorts
@minimightymouse @Wes_Clutch Wish you could make it out here, but always appreciate your tweets when you aren’t at the event!
@themohawkmike @TheBuffaloGame @JD3Studios @CEOGaming @StrongSide Welcome to the game!
@Connor_018 What?!? That’s awesome!
@ProMom9 Miss you and the family! I wish I was in Chicago for more than a couple nights so I could have swung by to say hi and spend some time with you and Mr P!
@JustSnipes Yes! Hope I get to see you soon!
@OhNoItsFused Thanks so much!
@MrHiglez Let’s keep the streak going to 6 next year!
@RustyPipBoy Thanks!
@MrHiglez Happy birthday to us! Hope you had a great day yesterday!
@JustinTheriauIt Thanks!
@Jeremy71146437 Thanks man!
@Lexi Was awesome to see you on the cover of American Way! Keep on crushing it! https://t.co/3ofMZXzdmC
@oreeeo You get your payment (exposure) as soon as people post the photos online. Seems like this mainly falls on you.
@aagold3 @ChrisBaldwinter @KillerQueenGame Yeah - it’ll be fun to cast with Garson! Let’s try to cast a match together on Sunday at some point.
@aagold3 @ChrisBaldwinter @KillerQueenGame Hahaha! See you this weekend man! Also, we need to jump in the commentary booth together sometime this weekend!
Ordering my Nintendo Switch today for Killer Queen Black! https://t.co/eW8MhskCKa
@OnsetMTH I also want more close-range combat! Thanks for the shoutout.
@JustSnipes I can’t wait!!!
Stream's going live now! Get in here for some FFA action casted by @OnsetMTH and myself! https://t.co/ksvMp0lZTx
@slkeene @redbullesports @Enable @Nadeshot @PartinGBigBoy @OpTicFlamesword @SC2Bomber @MLGACE @ASTROGaming @AssaultCL @AudreyAdair Amazing shots! Thanks for taking such good care of me during your years at Red Bull.
@KarmahTV @GoldenboyFTW @Axeltoss Someone has to try and keep these Alexes in check.
@MLGKimo @Volamel We had a couple internal issues
@DrLupoOnTwitch @GoldenboyFTW Consider it done
@GoldenboyFTW My new todo list today:   1. Screenshot every tweet that has me in the top 10 2. Unblock your phone number  3. Text you all the screenshots
@Ninja Happy birthday dude! Excited to see you and @JGhosty in a few weeks!
@GrimBrotherOne @therealvivi @KornnerStudios @343Wrensi Inverted makes it more of a challenge. Default is too easy to play on.
@ZachWigal @Mr_Monopoli @StrongSide Heard it might not be the same as the arcade game. Might be a turn based game.
@TheSimms You should claim @TheSlimms before someone else takes it.
I will be holding on to these forever! Thanks again for the epic retirement gift! https://t.co/Kmop4vc8wT

@Kevin_Tang_ Still haunts me to this day.
@SuperOmarioBro Great meeting you too! I definitely want to put more hours into Rocket League after talking about it this past weekend!

@MrPARADlSE @laurence2571 I’m here!
@crispydew Yes!
I’m proud of what Gamers Outreach has accomplished these last 10 years. https://t.co/vdMlBuKP5H
@Fizzor_ @HashtagVeegie For a while I recorded pretty much every time I played.
Halo 1 pistol is one of the greatest weapons in all of gaming. https://t.co/GyE0h7zh5W
Got lunch today with @HashtagVeegie, who did the 3D work on my montage over 10 years ago! Where has the time gone? https://t.co/KQy5pDXY39
@TheLittleMoa Likewise! Catch you at another event!
@WARDOG Nice meeting you too!
@KyleJxhns Getting good at an activity has always helped me feel better and more productive. Reading has also entertained me by getting to live an adventure or gaining a greater appreciation for life by understanding it from someone else’s perspective. Wishing you the best.
@Tocom11 @TheSimms @TeamEnVyUs @Splyce Let’s do something early May!
@Tocom11 @TheSimms @TeamEnVyUs @Splyce Bummed we didn’t get to meet up!
Mama Walsh is a fair weather fan https://t.co/jMfC9MXnnc
@tigould I’ll be roaming the floor more today!
@minimightymouse I might have to teach these whippersnappers a lesson or two.
Up next on the Bravo station we have Infused taking on Renegades! Get in here! https://t.co/RiSGlxFUKM #HaloWC https://t.co/6eOuFntn7p

@BeyondJoseph @CaesarsPalace Good seeing you too man!
Great venue and crowd here in Vegas for GOW! https://t.co/RGcMpAOZFt
@marstonnigelp Nope. Told me to go to their gift shop.
Don’t forget your toothbrush when going to Las Vegas https://t.co/N0bFpkUODJ
@jasonthinks Same. It’s been too long. When will you be in Seattle next?
@FYC_boxycotton Crazy enough, heading to Vegas and will see some of those same people this weekend. Is every MySpace page still up? I should check that out.
@jasonthinks I’m in SeaTac, but boarding right now at N2. Where you at?
@toph_bbq @KateMitchellOW Happy birthday dude!
@HashtagVeegie @Tocom11 @kjhovey @Rhabby_V That montage was incredible for its time because of Peridious's editing and your 3D intro. I live in Bellevue, let me know if you want to grab lunch one of these days.
One more week! https://t.co/w2n6Jdl69c

@letsgohome @HCS @GoldenboyFTW @TheSimms @OnsetMTH @Wonderboyo @Lethal_HT @Brav @Caster_Butters @RyInfinity @StrongSide @Elamite Pleasure working with you all again. See you in three weeks!
Mama Puckett is an angel. I’m in town to cast the Halo event and she swings by to give me a tin of cookies! https://t.co/VdVQODXI5D
@voteproud I don’t know. You should come in and ask the front desk if you’re already in the parking lot.
@DatDudeDiesel10 Great meeting you too - thanks for coming out and playing last night! I’ll see you at BB3 at the end of the year.  #Greedy
@minimightymouse @Wonderboyo What’s the count at now? I know I messed up and said it at least a few times last match!
@StDxSchool You’re a monster! Keep it up!
@voteproud Tickets are sold out. Only way to get in at this point is to get a ticket from someone who already bought one.
@SoyLiaRocha Always a pleasure to see you too!
@CristianFahren Great meeting you as well!
@LestatNstuff Happy to be back! It’s been too long!
@GTHalo @KnightysKnight @Wonderboyo @TheShyWay I need to study up on Canadian pop culture next time!

What a matchup. https://t.co/t4FQjM1e6u
@notoooooorious @TomRyanOGRE2 @DanRyanOGRE1 @StrongSide Come say hi tomorrow! I’ll try to swing by the CS setup at some point.
@Spartan Get ready to carry me
@TheSimms @Wonderboyo I’ll take care of it.
@BertTheBigHurt I have a few games under my belt! DM me your tag
@CloudysToxic I only had one channel. There were multiple others that used my name without asking.
@TaKe_NoTeZz Was one of my old tags - I think that one got stolen too :(
@notoooooorious @TomRyanOGRE2 @DanRyanOGRE1 @StrongSide &lt;3
@hottshy @WlLEY_COYOTE I saw that clip! You’re sick at the game! Maybe after I get some more hours into Fortnite we should run some duos together.
@SpenserKern @DatDudeDiesel10 I’m planning on going! Hopefully see you there!
@PhilRanta Great catching up - hope to see you again soon!
@WonderboyHalo @MartinOmes @EGLXofficial @Moses_FPS @PmL_Ninjutsu Beating up the old man Voldemort wasn’t enough for you?
@MattSparkuhl Can’t have you swing by the office, but I’d be happy to meet up with you for lunch one of these days. Free in early March?
@ChrisKurlz @OpTicGaming @TeamEnVyUs @Lunchbox @theRoyBorg @Pistola_nV These are awesome!
@BeyondJoseph @GamersOutreach @TeamBeyondnet @OSUWexMed @RocketLeague Great work man!
Optic has stopped messing around. They will win if they play like this the rest of the tournament.
What a comeback by Optic! I started to count them out after that 0-2 start on Coliseum CTF.
@ShonzoBall Poor words from me there! I overcomplicated trying to say that the flag takes so long to reset without an enemy on it.
@heytred 100% chance I would have been there
@GrindouTeSports Thanks man! I am planning on going to BumbleBash 3, hope to see you there!
I can confirm. https://t.co/SDulstNPJV
@DeRsKeezY @StrongSide @ZachWigal @GoldenboyFTW @TheSimms @TheBuffaloGame Pathetic. I demand a less corrupt commissioner.
@VwS_BroadSide The call out is real!
Gamers Outreach is looking for volunteers to play video games in hospitals with kids. Great way to do what you love while giving back to those in need. https://t.co/Oeg6abDqMH
@awesomejoshua See you in March!
@Brav @Joe_Fries You’re right, but I can’t really say I’m surprised.
@Joe_Fries ... Should have stayed some extra days to game.
@GrimisS Kicking a man while he’s down.
@laurence2571 @HCS @Halo @StrongSide @EDWSnip3down @RyanTowey @MLG Happy that you can make it out! I’ll see you there!
@Jump_ @TheSimms Gaming events are sort of like the old rap duo Kris Kross, they make me want a @Jump_.
@jdickson93 See you there! Was a blast meeting you last time. We should see if there is a nearby pinball bar in Columbus.
@MLGSireph @MLGKimo Nothing will ever top that game. And nothing will ever restore Will’s trust in Kimo.
@TheSimms Can’t wait to get back in the booth! I’ll see you soon.
!!!! https://t.co/ao4Px4F9a8
@Porgeland Always great seeing you dude!
@alanwdang @GroundKontrol I was there! I will probably come out again in 3-6 months from now.
@DnnRoxas As long as you include a self addressed box + postage to send it back. I can DM you my work address.
@AndrewHanus Staying busy with the game dev job!
@OpTicMaNiaC @OpTicHitch I took your advice, but I should have said no when he asked to take care of my facial hair. https://t.co/9SJwfWxOgO
@JustSnipes GET OUT HERE!
@RammyyHimself I’m down to play some now. I’ll dm you so we can add each other on Steam.
@RammyyHimself I haven’t touched it recently, but was playing it a bunch for a few weeks when it first came out.
@jakedailyyo @wecameasromans I’ll do that now!
This is awesome! @wecameasromans sent me a gift pack after I️ tweeted about their album a couple weeks ago! https://t.co/3SZEHdtj8F
@EcIips3 @Brutus_PS Grenade + reload + reload in quick succession was an offhost glitch that auto-reloaded your gun.
@BrandonDefy The struggle is real.
Anothing typo... I’m done with Twitter for today.
Was so focused on not having the iOS bug show “I️” in my tweet that I totally messed up and forgot the include the word “life” in my tweet. Only time I’ve choked when it something related to Halo 2.
I spent countless hours on this game, which positively changed my in ways I never could have imagined. Happy birthday, Halo 2! https://t.co/vmLJeNT9Mj

@JordanTuran14 Yeah! I went to Switzerland to study cloud computing and finish up my CS degree.
@MoNsTcR Congrats on the 2nd place man! Happy to see you killing it in the H1Z1 scene!
Up next is the Elimination Bracket Finals match with @Splyce vs @TeamLiquid! https://t.co/65clhRTnO0 https://t.co/78R2UowBzx
@ZachWigal @KillerQueenGame Nice! Are you running Queen or riding snail?
@MamaRosaMakeup @General_Mittenz @mcstrongside @TheSimms NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Thanks for having us! https://t.co/7VcXZefZlj
@ZachWigal @KillerQueenGame @InventONater I’m with you in spirit today https://t.co/Sw0gNtiXfl
@laurence2571 @mcstrongside If you don’t make it out to the next event, we’ll hopefully come overseas again to say hi!
@Epic_Kayozz Nice meeting you man! How’d you do in round 2 of the FFA?
Up next at Dreamhack Denver we have @EvilGeniuses vs @TeamLiquid! https://t.co/65clhRTnO0 https://t.co/6QqJr2KXB2
Great video! https://t.co/9iLJCxUZFM
@JHowGaming @Halo Thanks man! Hope you’re enjoying the games.
@jessicamonda @DrDisRespect My bad! Are you planning on swinging by the DH event this weekend?
@minimightymouse Thanks!
@_habooya Doubletree!
@ChrisGuthrie One of these days!
I will have this album on loop today in between casting Halo matches. https://t.co/WjDNu3NnrS
Found @DrDisRespect while wearing his Blockbuster champion tshirt. https://t.co/ETHRwEKWos
@Dub_XL @Tsquared Happy birthday!
@jjbouc @ZachWigal @InventONater Pokemaster JJ
@BeyondJoseph Agreed. Apparently our pun sense is more cultivated than the masses.
@Chiig @TiberiusAudley Why would I go to a place that doesn’t have a pun as its name?
@TiberiusAudley Both names are so damn good. How can I just instantly count out HAPPY GRILLMORE?
I need help choosing which food truck I should go to today. Happy Grillmore (burgers) or Naansense (Indian)?
Awwww yeah! See you all in Denver this weekend! https://t.co/pLlNg89cZ9
Going live in two minutes as we watch teams battle it out in Legendary Cup #4 for $5,000! https://t.co/65clhSaYFy https://t.co/VoNTCH440U https://t.co/mkQKW0XsMV
@PrototypeMEM Oh snap! I need to go to this place asap!
Picture for context https://t.co/NBe0xGvpBm
Whoa. I’m not as good as I used to be, but Washy is uncalled for. https://t.co/jEPeMESOCK
@LAN_Valen I mean it’s no Applebee’s BBQ, but it gets the job done.
@PrototypeMEM Pics or it doesn’t count
@LordZ__ That was fun!
@Gooner_Finch Container Park
@JayxLinh Count me in!
@Mikuz I’ll check that out next time I’m here!
@heytred So good!!
@Braddock512 Mac and cheese is where it’s at!
I apparently didn’t get enough the last two weekends so I went directly from the airport back to Big Ern’s BBQ. https://t.co/xlIpgZIMCB
@Bullxt_ Wish I could find the time to stream - been super busy since I started the game dev job.
@ChadLarsson @millesports Best of luck with your new esports franchise and thank you for everything you’ve done (so far) for the Halo scene!
@calloussss I forgot to ask, what was the closest match your team had?
@SkywardPrim @BigErnsBBQ Nope. It’s a stand-alone store.
Delicious way to end my trip to Vegas. https://t.co/WmzogZiPn3
@calloussss Congrats man!
Going live now with @millesports Legendary Cup #3! https://t.co/65clhSaYFy https://t.co/C8IixaMM4s
Had fun swinging by and casting a match! https://t.co/IZcdD090nc

Check out the national tournament for my favorite arcade game! https://t.co/wNRPafLoS5 #bumblebash https://t.co/qAZsKIS1np
@HCS_Takedown @Tsquared @_Yiws @Xrossfade @Elamite I was miles away, but I appreciate the concern.
Going live in five minutes with @millesports Legendary Cup #2 https://t.co/65clhSaYFy https://t.co/lCY6NmLFqR
@IGoTNoAiMBoT Nice! Did you get the tattoos when H3 came out or did you get them recently as a throwback?
@ChadLarsson Happy birthday!
@heytred This is my favorite day at work so far
@JuggleRob Let me know when shirts/hoodies are available so I can buy one!
@GoldenboyFTW @united @Delta But for real, being platinum you might be able to get comped on another airline with equivalent status.
@GoldenboyFTW @united Huge shoutout to @Delta and @united for keeping GB out of first class! https://t.co/GLeuuEsq0G
Live in three minutes with @millesports Legendary Cup #1! https://t.co/qX0jLwz1Bi https://t.co/TnI1icGe69
@AKut47 Halo 1 was ahead of its time and still holds up as an incredible game.
@adamkovic Called me a loser so I'm returning the shirt. https://t.co/pKpvvtKhxk
@SighDefect I was out camping this weekend, otherwise I would have swung by like I did at the end of the last event!
@ZachWigal @jjbouc @KillerQueenGame @mcstrongside @InventONater NICE!! Now we need to take @InventONater out to play!
@pancakepow @AMD @AMDGaming Great seeing you again!
@walkerb See you there!
@Dyesect @FATAL1TY Thanks man! @FATAL1TY was one of the OGs that showed professional gaming was possible!
@brutallyvogue Did the poser at least order something good?
@Dyesect Nope.
@Robvolver I also won a Dodge Charger SRT8 taking 1st place in a Battlefield tournament
Proud of and happy for you! https://t.co/JMAqYnCva0
@OverwatchBoston @LorangerChris @overwatchleague Congrats @LorangerChris!
@Renegade_JW Happy birthday dude
@Renegade_JW 33 and I'm not feeling wavy
Always great to see @GamersOutreach in the news! https://t.co/uLLnUCKhjM
@Falloutt @JustSnipes There isn't a Sounders game during that time, but I'm down to figure out a night to meet up!
@JustSnipes @Falloutt Absolutely!
Check out https://t.co/Ag2h4lU2BS for some old school Halo 1 action this week! So many good memories with that game!
@DorkyShorty_YT Totally did! Randy and I used to hang out and game together all the time! I'm hoping to go to Portland soon to catch up with Randy.
My first time at The International earlier today. https://t.co/nKY3waPpL8
@oreeeo the way menus should be split up. https://t.co/1UMhWIs8F8
@MrBitterTV See you soon!
@MartinOmes happy belated birthday dude! Thank you for all you do for Gamers Outreach and the Halo scene.
@LEGIQN @oreeeo @ZachWigal @thinkreese @Joe_Fries @OZenrique7 @bluebirdicecrm Friday of PAX!
@ZachWigal @oreeeo @LEGIQN @thinkreese @Joe_Fries @OZenrique7 Next time you are all in Seattle I will take you over to @bluebirdicecrm!
Two GO-Karts are fixed up and back in circulation at @seattlechildren! https://t.co/hI3MH1Hmh2
@OG_Punchy Whoa - for some reason I thought it was more recent than that. Time flies by.
@alwayspaisley Congrats!
@alwayspaisley Your MBA is already done?
@ZachWigal I make sure to show this to @Mr_Monopoli on a daily basis.
@LxthuL @Mikwen_nV @NickBesTMaN @therealgoldx @Ninja_TB Worth it. If I couldn't be the best in the world, I had to establish myself as one of the best in Michigan by taking you out.
@iCyborg117 Anytime! Thanks for coming out!
@ElevateMao @Vanirfreyja &lt;3
@SavageShaw Great meeting you!
@Mikwen_nV @NickBesTMaN @therealgoldx @Ninja_TB I should have already retired!
@OpTicMaNiaC Was looking for you!
@MMKevlar Sorry to hear that it was stolen :(
@BC_Breakdowns Nope.
@SighDefect @HCS @mcstrongside One of these days!
@Maximum_Clutch @GamersOutreach Thanks! I rock it on casts when I can!
Grand Finals time here at Dreamhack Atlanta with @OpTicGaming vs @Splyce! Get in here: https://t.co/qX0jLwhqJK #HCS https://t.co/abduX5lWU4
@Ninja_TB Congrats man!
It's pretty much OUR 6 month engagement anniversary! https://t.co/AVzBVMxjrN
@chirikalov Yo!
@ProverbsAngel @EsportsKnighty Thanks!
@tlither No problem!
@StKGrandPaC Wish you were here too! It's been too long and we miss you! cc:@mcstrongside
@JayxLinh You can take the gamer out of the street, but you can't take the street out of the gamer.
@I_Sparks_I Around 6 more hours
@HiddenXperia @Greenskull I will probably swing by for a few hours one of the days!
@Greenskull &lt;/3
@Daffs_ Congrats on the win!
@aglmegadeath @Greenskull ?
@Greenskull I miss you too! See you at PAX in a month?
@JoeyReWiNDDavis @Halo @TeamEnVyUs Next time if I'm not casting an event I hope to get an invite to the viewing party at your place!
@HoaxerTV Heading over now.
@SlieghtH It's a must read.
@OpTicHitch @OpTicMaNiaC Still here? Swing by the back - otherwise I will have to catch you tomorrow!
@OpTicMaNiaC @OpTicHitch Was going to ask when I would get to see you guys at DH, but this is not the best thread to ask.
@I_Sparks_I I'm still here watching the Liquid/Splyce match! 4 rows behind Team Liquid, come over here!
@slkeene Because a few of the scenes were similar to how I imaged them. Especially the ballroom dance scene!
@slkeene Good point - I don't want this to be botched like Ender's Game. This trailer was rad, I'm pretty confident after a few of the clips....
@sSacrifice_ @TeamEnVyUs @OxygenSupremacy Thanks!
Up next we have @TeamEnVyUs vs @OxygenSupremacy! https://t.co/65clhRTnO0 #HCS https://t.co/mRCy1klRuc
"Ryannoob says bye ya noob" is my favorite quote of the weekend from @Caster_Butters
2018 needs to hurry up and get here! https://t.co/OXhJe6qg3t
@ARonaWillDo Nice meeting you too!
What a game!
@JuggleRob Bummer! Hope to catch you at another event before G4G 2018!
@JuggleRob Will you be at DH this weekend?
@LAN_Valen I'm going to pass out right now and wake up for rehearsals. Let's try to catch each other tonight or at the venue tomorrow!
@Overshields @ItsMayybee Haven't heard of it before. I'll look it up!
@ConsiderIt_dunN Sorry for such a delayed response! I'll DM you my number and let's catch up when I get in!
@RyanFoolz See you soon!
Flying out tonight to Atlanta for Dreamhack! Who else will I see there?
@OneRepublic my girlfriend got this email too late because she was up north with me and my family. She is a huge fan - anything you can do? https://t.co/4SAmv3fgra
@ZachWigal @TheBuffaloGame @mcstrongside @GoldenboyFTW @TheSimms @OpTicFlamesword And I present to you the world's weakest Buffalo https://t.co/B2x4KLLHjG
@MightyMouseUFC I didn't know you lived in the Seattle area! Hit me up if you want to check out this sick arcade game called Killer Queen.
Grand finals time for Legendary Cup #4! https://t.co/qX0jLwz1Bi
Up next in Legendary Cup #4 we have the LB Finals with Wise Gaming taking on Era Eternity! https://t.co/qX0jLwz1Bi https://t.co/ZaMfV970Hm
@ZachWigal @GrimisS @KillerQueenGame Godspeed my snail friend
@heytred @Wolfmayyne Nice! Make sure to take some pictures. See you soon!
@Devious_Kitten Yep!
@HavoKProphecy Thanks!
@PmL_BaesedGod You're a true champ - I could never claw very well on the duke's, but I loved doing it on the S types.
@ZachtehCEO Lateness on my part or a strategic social media strategy? I'll never tell.
@MLGSireph @MLGKimo @mcstrongside Thanks!
@MLGSireph @MLGKimo @mcstrongside The ending of the game in Cbus was my favorite "Will, I promise on my life that I'm not the werewolf!" -Alex
@jamaican116 @Moses_FPS See you there!
@ReflexHalo @walkerb It was @walkerb's camera and I don't remember the model.
@heytred @Wolfmayyne Going to be a blast! What day do you move here and what day do you start?
@DevilVeteran59 @ProximittyCE Has she always been slaying or did she totally surprise you when she picked up the sticks?
@OG_Punchy I am so sorry to hear that. Way too soon. You had the cat for about four years, right?
@Tuckbuttt @GH057ayame @masoncobb For writing I'd recommend On Writing Well by Zinsser and Elements of Style by Strunk and White.
@Tuckbuttt @GH057ayame @masoncobb Learn programming/scripting and start making stuff - I'd suggest UE4 or Unity. Writing and communication is incredibly important as well..
@DustyFotter Was a fun business venture to try!
Going to commentate @MightyMouseUFC and @BlessedMMA playing NES Punchout! https://t.co/hLIyXEYZY9 https://t.co/oyVTS9DpIg
@thatcodystoner I will absolutely be that dad if/when I have kids!

@d_wrecktion @HCS Thank you!
@Rippon_HCE @JGh0sty You're not as late as I am! Thanks for the bday wish and an extra late happy birthday is owed to @JGh0sty!

@HuNteR_Jjx Thanks man! It's been a good year so far, time to finish up the second half strong. Hope you're doing well!
@AKut47 @HCS Thanks! Hopefully we'll get to meet again at another Halo event soon!
@jdickson93 cut off my subscriptions on Twitch. I haven't streamed in months and that's not fair to anyone who is still subbed to my channel! 2/2
@jdickson93 First off - I love running in to you at the events since we can chat Halo and pinball. Secondly, I need to either stream or... (1/2)
@343iCommunity Thanks for watching over the years!
@D_Randa Thank you step-son
@W0uld Thanks! Was a blast casting with you too man! Hope all is going well with you.
@Moses_FPS I also thought I was already following you? Sorry if I somehow unfollowed!
@Moses_FPS Dude! So far this is my favorite picture tweeted to me on my birthday! Thanks so much for making this old man smile!

@MLG_BCognac Thanks man! When will we cross paths again? It's been too long!

@stianeklund Thanks!
@thezyfe Thank you!
@xraylegend I definitely enjoyed the day, thanks so much!
@KMaddify What a throwback! What event was this? I'm guessing it was 2012 or 2013?
@Devious_Kitten Thanks for the bday wish and thanks for coming out to volunteer at Gamers For Giving!
@Dallay_Lama Thanks man! Will I see you at Dreamhack?
@DulaiAllDay Thanks!

Packwood Lake https://t.co/seeqZrOPcW
@theRoyBorg @masoncobb @eclipson @Lunchbox @RyanTowey Towey tanks are funny to think about now, but during the GB matches I sure as hell wasn't laughing.
Also, I still need to respond to everyone who sent me a birthday tweet. Sorry for being slow on social media!
Up next in Legendary Cup #3 we have the LB Finals with Gosu Crew vs Wise Gaming! https://t.co/qX0jLwz1Bi https://t.co/aMMGmvBIBa

@arjbarker Excited for your show tonight!
Check it out! https://t.co/JsnKSjLhGf
@Project_GRideR There's a reason the line for the al pastor is so long! It's worth the wait!
@SilverGamingCS Hey! Where did you meet up with my Dad? I assume playing pool somewhere?
@Project_GRideR Glad you enjoyed the place! Did you try the al pastor?
@TheUltimateFox1 I'll have to bring the series back one of these days!
@CondoRiZz @Spartan Hahaha - we did play paintball!
@Spartan Such a fun LAN!
@MordenNZ @EsportsGears Not this year.
@MordenNZ @EsportsGears You were at the event?!? I was there too, we should have met up!
This is the exact phrase I use when telling the European Halo casters what weather to dress for when visiting. https://t.co/59fwobcuuw
@GH057ayame happy birthday dude!
@Reiku78 @GH057ayame @ske7ch @Chiig Definitely watch out - I'll be throwing left hooks and right claws.
@PhilWhi7 Great meeting you too!
These look amazing! https://t.co/99mtQUBqVg
@kristen_ryan @DanRyanOGRE1 I'm happy I wasn't the only one to notice!
@DanRyanOGRE1 That shirt and one of your soccer shirts has lived through hundreds of gaming sessions!
@Project_GRideR They have two locations in Vegas with one right on the strip.
We start up in 45 mins. See you all soon! https://t.co/TdxQYQnSbS
@TobyDillman @GhostGaming_GG @TeamEnVyUs Fun to watch!
Watching the LB Finals with @GhostGaming_GG vs @TeamEnVyUs live in Las Vegas! My first MLG event I'm not competing or casting. #GearsVegas https://t.co/rqe5OEoy5x
@UGCmatt Hahaha! That was your exact reaction too!
@RdotChadha Will have to check it out the next time I'm there!
@MrAdamAp What time will you be at the venue? Didn't get to see you yesterday.
@thyAshes @EsportsGears Loving the energy at the event! Thanks for breaking down the top level strategy with me!
I eat here almost every time I'm in Vegas. So damn good! https://t.co/Zq6fHSmng8
Great seeing you too! This event looks awesome! https://t.co/ieTr1CVxUe

@iiBiiRD Opened up a Fat Tire shortly after the picture was taken :)
@FinalArazome What do you mean?
@laurence2571 I've had this "desk" for over 5 years and I love it!
@lunch_box77 Come on over!
Prepping some teriyaki kabobs while watching the HCS LCQ! https://t.co/Xq3WdhZjNA
@thislukesmith great job at the reveal today!
@OpTic_Alpaca @DavidSsandman Pathetic. Meg carried so hard.
@Sgibs7 @MaddenBible @TeamLiquid @Splyce @mcstrongside @HCS @UMGEvents Probably won't be there this year, but I'll let you know if that changes.
@Sgibs7 @MaddenBible @TeamLiquid @Splyce @mcstrongside @HCS @UMGEvents I should have given you a heads up that we were in your state!
@tylerhammer @GoldenboyFTW @mcstrongside @TheSimms @WonderboyHalo @GH057ayame @EsportsOnset Thank you for the work all weekend! Wouldn't have been able to do it without you.
@themohawkmike @mcstrongside @TheBuffaloGame @PlayUFS Welcome to the game!

@Jose_Garton Yeah!
@calloussss I'll have to give Fuku Burger a try!
@calloussss Their al pastor tacos are undoubtedly the best tacos I've ever had. I try to stop there every time I'm in Vegas.
@K1NGofG4M3S Nice meeting you too!
Two of my favorite food spots in Vegas have to be Tacos El Gordo and Cous Cous. https://t.co/RZJJTQznwG
@eSaysThis @HCS @GoldenboyFTW @mcstrongside @GH057ayame @TheSimms @EsportsOnset @WonderboyHalo @LandoCoD @UMGEvents Miss you E!
@Troop_PM @DavidVonderhaar And yes to your original question. Took me about four years.
@Troop_PM @DavidVonderhaar Some people go in to just try and learn the shortcuts to pass the exams without understanding the importance of the math.
@Troop_PM @DavidVonderhaar Calculus and Discrete Structures can be intimidating, but if you go in to try and truly understand the math you will be fine.
@TheLegendP Old school!
@FaithSide_ I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL DOING SELFIES!
Today you need to check out @PUBATTLEGROUNDS's charity invitational benefiting @GamersOutreach! https://t.co/0UKuTa0WrK https://t.co/FcN4QlDdn8
Going to be a fun event to cast! https://t.co/0yxHeNHt0W
@Troop_PM @DavidVonderhaar All it takes is time. You have to be persistent and not give up easily because you will continually run into issues you can solve.
@jasonthinks @SmittyBoyTellEm @wewavedash And @LiquidKen's practice noob carried me to top 8 in doubles at a west coast MLG event!
@SmittyBoyTellEm @wewavedash @jasonthinks Absolutely!
Always trying to learn more about the best games out there. Thanks for the tutoring session! Hahaha https://t.co/KUfJxghPH6
@wewavedash Congrats @jasonthinks!
@GrimisS That is legit!
@OpTicMaNiaC Kind of tough when you set the bar so high. "Maniac's on a running riot. Again."
@ZachWigal @JuggleRob @KillerQueenGame You need to try the game!
@HUNGRYxB3AR @E3 Not sure if I'll be there this year.

@Elamite @Halo @intel @primagames @MLGACE @Lunchbox Now we just need to find an Elam that is a Halo expert!
@Elamite @Halo @intel @primagames Blame @MLGACE. @Lunchbox and I destroyed him so many times in Halo Wars 1 that 343 must have assumed Elams can't/won't play Halo Wars 2.
Thank you @Halo for the Halo Wars 2 care package! https://t.co/PlMGHyIyX3
@RiniGrandViper Saw it online and had to buy it!
@LEGIQN It's the go-to when one needs to get out of a lobby.

@Commonly Tried to make my gamertag THETRUTH and that was randomly generated tag.
Live in five with the HCS Open Circuit Legendary Cup! Tune in to watch @RyanTowey and I cast today's matches: https://t.co/feyMOQbaGt https://t.co/aYXFdVPvYy
@ScottGandhi happy birthday!
Chicken shawarma from Cous Cous https://t.co/OS19IOyuCZ
@Fley__ I might jump back on later tonight - when do you usually play?
@Fley__ Check my level now!
@leopardstealth https://t.co/tTdyP8czLB
@RedghostFPS I might do a giveaway one day, but I don't currently have anything for sale.
@Vindexterity Not sure where you can get it. Sorry I couldn't be more help!
Shadowrun was such a fun game to play when you got eight players of equal skill together. https://t.co/sGSa7UtI1y
Here are the details for @UGCevents Halo 5 tournament in St. Louis - see you there! https://t.co/DsiBm6021o https://t.co/d7w6y13Kfp
@Potthoff @UGCevents @MartinOmes see you there!
I flew out to Las Vegas to cast the @ProGamingLeague HCS Open Circuit with @Tsquared! https://t.co/feyMOQbaGt https://t.co/9ClTLFfcd3
@Sloth_Hipster @Xinthus_LoL I'll be hanging out with Ryan when I'm back around Xmas.
@LiverpoolRising this one is in Las Vegas, I don't know if there is one in Seattle.
@Sloth_Hipster this one is in Las Vegas, but I think there are a couple locations in Michigan.
Top Golf is so much fun! Highly recommend it. https://t.co/EetTTjidWh
@leopardstealth casting for @ProGamingLeague's HCS Open Circuit!
Merica https://t.co/stGnMYNoRL
@OpTicMaNiaC best of luck with whatever is next for you - will miss watching LANiac's sniping sprees at events this year.
I miss casting with and making fun of @GoldenboyFTW  https://t.co/iVBHO7nCL0
@M0orty nope
Thanks to the @Halo crew for the nice gift! I can't wait to frame these and hang them up. https://t.co/4k1EWqkMgU
@Joe_Fries @LEGIQN @ZachWigal @oreeeo @OZenrique7 Molly Moon's in Seattle. They properly communicate about spoons. https://t.co/yk0zAy4GCp
@ScottGandhi not sure if I agree with that!
@wutronic thanks Lukasz! You ever make it up to Seattle for gaming related wok?
@Phizzzzzy @ScottGandhi in my defense, I go MIA on Twitter all the time. Even without the job excuse.
@bobbysundara wish I could!
@jasonthinks @ScottGandhi always down to talk games! Hope all is well with you, Jason.
@TheSimms thanks!
@awesomejoshua just start a northwest tour!
@Darkness429 thanks Tim!

@OpTicMaNiaC @Chriss_cnc about damn time
Check out https://t.co/7qj3vazH1X for some rare Halo:CE action! BTW - Nistic hasn't changed his play style in 13 years and I love it.
@JustinCaffier sure thing. DM me whenever you get a chance.
@Poor_Andrew @TomRyanOGRE2 @DanRyanOGRE1 pretty sure there was a quote along the lines of "there is no way I'm puking tonight"
@jdickson93 I like the idea of having matchmaking rules be the same as the tournament rules, but a full reset seems to be too much.
Teams already had 15 minutes to prove they were better. There needs to be some likely game-end situation.  https://t.co/cb7j7mphJE
I think overtime needs to be first cap.
@CoachMayyne I would love to be out there!
First match of the Halo 5 NA Summer Finals is starting now! check it out at https://t.co/qX0jLwhqJK https://t.co/rxEwUhNssz

@IMP3RlUS we are long overdue, @TheSimms!
@i0sen @Holy if you bring Xboxes and TVs to ZHAW I will play a couple games on my lunch break.

@Gncsis_HCS Mr. Jolink's class, right?
@MrPARADlSE I leave in about 12 hours
@xbl_xsk I should have arranged something earlier. I leave tomorrow morning to Zurich :(
Dachau https://t.co/2LCFoL7KfX
@Cortalisk Nope - I'm in Germany right now!
@lasteferih @Brav even more reason for me to visit next time!
@Greenskull Creme Brûlée from Paris - 10/10 https://t.co/5tmheAsTdu
@lasteferih @Brav not this trip. Hopefully the next time I vacation in Europe I will visit Barcelona!
I now need to try and grow my hair out like that.  https://t.co/GSill9JUWA
@Brav I had quite an amazing time yesterday. So glad you recommended Paris!
@TaLiiic Bonjour! I'm loving Paris so far!
@FlamezEU was cheering on England, but that didn't go very well.
@bobbyx249 was rooting for England...
Waiting for the England vs Iceland match out here in Paris! https://t.co/AgITviAoBq
@Moanaaah I leave this morning for Paris. Did we just miss each other again?
Got a tour of Netherlands from my incredible tour guides, @followgrubby and @followcassandra! https://t.co/Ml9N8Svo2f
@Filthierich just followed you back, feel free to DM me.
@MLGACE I will have to try and find this place - is it spelled Lucerne? I had a couple friends recommend Lucerne.
@brewstorm1170 loving it!
@IamMKB_ I'm hooked. I plan to finish the book over the next week.
@samsabri I'm in Zurich! I took a 20-minute train to Uetliberg and hiked up a path to this restaurant.
@IamMKB_ 1Q84

@AsauaeSaawa @theRealShooKon3 I owe Shook a lifetime supply of Sprite if he is collecting with interest.
@RealGoose 1Q84 - I'm 300 pages in and I love it so far.
@MiloRoss thank you!
@KyleHigley84 happy early birthday!
@leopardstealth isn't* (you know what I meant!)
@leopardstealth it hasn't that trippy yet, but I heard it is must-read.
@heytred @_harukimurakami I'm only ~100 pages in, but I like the story so far and I LOVE Murakami's style.
@CouRageJD thanks!
Last meal before a nine hour flight to Zurich. See you in three weeks, America! https://t.co/GgIcJzvN8O
@KeepHaloAlive not for a bit, I fly out to Europe for three weeks starting tomorrow.
@DanGheesling we should play some Overwatch together sometime when I get back from traveling! I'll DM you my bnet tag.
@Unyshek is one of your job requirements to get sick Killpocalypes for the HCS stream to show during commercial break?
@TomRyanOGRE2 you should cast some EU Halo Pro League with @OnsetHalo on Friday!
@DanGheesling @BaerTaffy hahaha! I will have to check this video out when I get home.
Agreed! Maybe try to do an episode sometime before I leave on Wednesday? https://t.co/TiiWJywQ3a
Looks awesome - can't wait to check it out! https://t.co/rSOqs1mL7u
@ESLHalo Any time!

@TheSimms @Tashi343i @Unyshek EZ
@Lawler_RL @GoldenboyFTW hahaha!
@FierceEIite E6 has been playing far below my expectations, especially yesterday. After E6 got 3-0d by ALG, I'd say this was a surprise.
I didn't expect that to happen. Kudos to E6.
@PuLse_SLG Good work - overall I was really impressed by you. You and your team have potential, just have to talk more in-game plans.
I will be casting some EU Halo Pro League today at 1:45pm EST on https://t.co/HHtjg5IGcm! See you in one hour. https://t.co/gkyMcxCMTi
@SrgntBallistic @quinndelhoyo @mcstrongside @Tashi343i I would have been off yesterday by predicting RNG and E6 to win.
@quinndelhoyo @mcstrongside @Tashi343i didn't all of you call a CLG 3-0?
@I_Sparks_I if they keep this up for another 1-2 years I would say it's a fair comparison.
Up next is CLG vs EG - get in here! https://t.co/qX0jLwhqJK https://t.co/eOmtmKnfW2
@Ninja_VwS I definitely miss it from time to time.
@SrgntBallistic I wasn't playing last night, but I have been playing Overwatch a couple nights a week.

@HotformHS I can understand a tournament having to enforce a time limit, but a player going out of their way for a dq is a bit much.
@HotformHS that's so lame
@THEPeteCoUk not my house!

@Brav Yes. I would like you to reopen the poll so I can get my vote in.
@Brav Nah
@CS_s3lioh I will watch this when I leave the venue and have a better connection - can't wait to check it out!
@C9Mang0 are you in Toronto for EGLx?
@BertTheBigHurt nah
@Magsin_EH @C0VENT @NthusiastGaming @UnEarthedGamin @GizmoJBT @PeaceLaBeast where was my invite?!? That looks delicious!
Welcome to the second worst decision in your life. Your first worst decision was being friends with Goldenboy.  https://t.co/cN2f8G1rI8
@djkillerflex4d yeah! Here to commentate the EGLx Halo event!
@LorangerChris see you tomorrow then!
@esportsdoug I'm about to head out to dinner, we should grab a drink later tonight though!
@LorangerChris Hey! I'm in Toronto, let me know if you want to meet up!
@RyaNoobALG @GoldenboyFTW I will try to respond more in-depth after finals, but GB receives a lot of hate for no reason is most cases.
@RyaNoobALG @GoldenboyFTW in gaming. He brings energy, makes it appealing to someone unfamiliar with Halo, and knows the game in-depth. 2/2
@RyaNoobALG @GoldenboyFTW Will read this and respond when I'm done with finals, but first thought is that GB is one of the best casters 1/2
Had a great time competing against you, watching you, and working with you. Best of luck in your next steps brotha! https://t.co/gbKSRLRH0u

@M_Khalilian @halodatahive the part that confuses me is that even if they are getting destroyed in scrims, why is slayer their lowest win %?
@M_Khalilian @halodatahive misread your tweet - my apologies!
@KnightyK_HCS those were the ONLY teams we would lose to online and we we were winning more than 25% of our games against those teams.
These stats are incredibly surprising: such a low win percentage - especially in slayers.  https://t.co/0txofvE2Fj
Middy was the best dog https://t.co/OH6Q7B3Z2g

Our response to the Halo tournament cancellation this past weekend: https://t.co/fkSuYe3FGE
@ImCotyy likewise! Great work this weekend, you should be incredibly proud of how much you were able to raise.
@ESA_Wade @PreSchool_Slays good idea - will look into making this happen, but don't want to promise anything until we have a plan.
@PreSchool_Slays with you? I don't want technical difficulties at our event to be the reason you lose your love for Halo and competition.
@PreSchool_Slays We also wish we didn't have issues - my team tried its best. Is there anything I can do to help make this better 1/2
@TuViciouz @mcstrongside that would have been perfect! I wish I had service in the venue to read this earlier.
Got to meet @JackTheCEO today! https://t.co/OQvaQ4zYQA

@i_Liiah I'll be there - see you in a few weeks!
@Teapot_Yo I would be interested in playing a couple games! Please find me at the venue if this happens.
@GH057ayame @SquidGrip @Twitch but after playing the first couple games with you, realized how good you were and we kept playing! 2/2
@GH057ayame @SquidGrip @Twitch I remember inviting you because you asked for a game multiple times on IRC and thought I'd just be nice 1/2
@bthomas360 @GamersOutreach nice - I'll see you there!

Casting @EvilGeniuses vs Triggers Pound with the WutFace himself, @GoldenboyFTW! https://t.co/qX0jLwhqJK https://t.co/3ZYlgWnQNR
@GoldGloveTV hey - you should come game with @ImCotyy at Gamers For Giving on March 12/13! When can we jump on a call?
@LxthuL @GoldenboyFTW @Benson_EU @GH057ayame ? https://t.co/PCVgVgH839
@gottaburnemall @_killfeed_ Allegiance is too strong. I think Allegiance will 3-0 or 3-1 Optic
@NightFoxx_ @_killfeed_ I don't think so. In that case TP and Optic will be tied with 4 games each and then TP wins the heads up vs Optic
I think if Optic 3-0's Allegiance, they and Triggers Pound will advance with 4 games each compared to Allegiance's 3 https://t.co/jndOEmykJr
First tiebreaker is amount of games won between the tied teams.  AvB 3-0 AvC 0-3 BvC 3-1 C advances with 4 games won https://t.co/sGtJvzp792

@iMasterMinded great point.
@Naded I approve.
@iMasterMinded Kristi made a decent point saying how each expertise is divided. For example - baseball players can't win a Super Bowl ring.
@NightFoxx_ yes.
So you're saying there's a chance? https://t.co/R3amlq7BlP

@FSAviations headshots only matter after the shield has been pierced. 3 BR shots to the body and 1 to the head = 4 BR shots to the head.

@sunnyst4r @GetEmGurl_ @FemaleJedi_ Too late, they are gone.
@FemaleJedi_ These bananas aren't spotted, they are pure darkness
@FemaleJedi_ Not old?!? I thought a banana's ripe color was yellow, not black!
@SlieghtH You and @FemaleJedi_ are making the assumption that I know how to make banana bread! Are you supposed to use old bananas?!?
@TeEsGATOR Nope. Going somewhere closer to downtown GR.
@MrMiyagiGO @ESLHalo @Battlefield definitely need to have a match soon!
