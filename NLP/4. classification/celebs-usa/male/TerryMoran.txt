@MassimoFaggioli "Zero tolerance for the sexual abuse of children by priests" and "Zero tolerance for covering it up" are sound moral precepts. Given the horrific place the Church has been FOR DECADES on this issue, raising objections to these foundational precepts is just quibbling and evasion.

@kcismek37 My point is twofold. 1) This is the precisely the same argument justifying taxation that Elizabeth Warren makes: Absent government action, the increased wealth would not have happened, thus justifying taking some of it in taxes. 2) It's still not Mexico paying for the wall.
Trump‚Äôs argument:  1. Government does something‚Äîthe USMCA.  2. Private businesses/citizens make more money.  3.

Brexit always seemed to me to be a failure of imagination. Deep reforms of the EU were glaringly necessary--but leaders only halfheartedly pursued them. So the answer, for many voters, was to cleave the UK from the huge European free-trade zone. They'll be poorer in the long run.

@Bradymjmc @LanceVader @AngusRockford His senior officers including McClaws and Longstreet (his second in command)were committing this crime openly and notoriously. As contemporaneous evidence in letters, logistical records,orders and more prove‚Äîit was a crime known and tolerated throughout Lee‚Äôs army, up to the top.
@mpdugas Read J.C.F. Fuller. Or John Keegan. Or any military historian who understands grand strategy.
@mpremo87 Lee suffered far more casualties‚Äî55,000 more‚Äîthan Grant, fighting the wrong war. He should have been fighting defensively and preserving his manpower. Lee was a brilliant tactician, but failed at grand strategy. Grant understood both‚Äîas his triumphs in the west and east prove.
@LanceVader @AngusRockford He also almost certainly countenanced his army‚Äôs kidnapping of free-born Americans of color residing in Pennsylvania and Maryland to bring them south and profit off their flesh by selling them into slavery, arguably the worst war crime Americans in uniform ever committed.

@jmwhit47 This is a typical Twitter distortion of a simple statement. I said nothing about abandoning one‚Äôs ideals or the drive for political/cultural/social change. One can, of course, seek to change minds and hearts in person, face to face, rather than remotely and anonymously.
Twitter isn‚Äôt real life. Cable news isn‚Äôt real life. Media isn‚Äôt real life.  The way to renew the American center is to turn off our screens, get out of our comfort zones, and encounter each other IRL with open minds and hearts. What‚Äôs so funny about peace love and understanding?
This idea that only Trump and the GOP played hardball on the Kavanaugh nomination is inaccurate. The Dems played rough, too. The leak of Blasey Ford‚Äôs letter was a calculated hardball move. It just backfired. Now, the midterms look different, and Kavanaugh is on the Court.

@benshapiro Agreed. One way witnesses are discredited at trial is through evidence they have fabricated before. People don‚Äôt just decide at 51 yrs old to tell a giant public lie. Evidence of prior fabrication in a witness‚Äô life is important. So is its absence‚Äînot dispositive, but probative.

@theajulieABC Not that I know of. But neither has Kavanaugh. His 2009 article is a discussion of policy changes Congress could make concerning presidents and criminal investigations. It's not an analysis of what the Constitution says about it.
Should Kavanaugh recuse himself in any SCOTUS case involving Donald Trump personally? In the past, justices have ruled on cases involving the president who appointed them. Breyer, Ginsburg didn't recuse in Clinton v Jones; Burger, Blackmun and Powell didn't recuse in US v Nixon.

@Prolifeldy It‚Äôs just reporting the facts as I saw them. And making sure that the many law enforcement officers on the scene doing their duty professionally and respectfully, and the people exercising their rights passionately but civilly, aren‚Äôt slandered. It wasn‚Äôt a mob scene.
@DerekTilton @isthisnameused @JWGOP It‚Äôs my reporting. The demonstrators I saw and heard for hours, the strong, respectful law enforcement presence, the many other TV crews and bystanders‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt see the mob scene she portrays. And I didn‚Äôt want all those exercising their rights passionately but civilly slandered.

@AngusRockford Barack Obama won Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania‚Äîtwice. So did Bill Clinton‚Äîtwice. HRC lost all five. Those voters haven‚Äôt vanished. Politics still works‚Äîif you work at it. That‚Äôs what Northam, Lamb,  Jones, Ocasio-Cortez and so many others are proving. Grow up.
@MattM3502 At the presidential level, yes. But, as you know, not in the electoral college. And at other levels of government, Democrats have lost more than a thousand offices‚Äîincluding 13 senate seats in recent years, leaving them with a steep challenge to block Trump‚Äôs SCOTUS pick.
@jedshug @jadler1969 That‚Äôs so weak. Your ‚Äútradition‚Äù is just a hodge-podge of cherry-picking, uninformed speculation, coincidence, and tendentiousness. You‚Äôre better off calling for raw exercises of partisan power, when Dems have it again, than trying to dress it all up with this ahistorical bunkum.
After the 2016 election, there were calls to abolish the electoral college. Now, after Kennedy‚Äôs retirement, there are calls to ‚Äúpack‚Äù the Supreme Court.  Whatever the merits and political viability of these proposals, at some point, Dems will need to win more races.
@AngusRockford You are making my point precisely. Threats of bogus impeachment by Republicans would, under this spurious ‚Äútradition,‚Äù prevent every Democratic president from appointing SCOTUS justices. And vice versa. There is no such ‚Äútradition.‚Äù Starting one is desperate. Win elections.
@CitedForClarity @brbassoff @mattyglesias Robert Jackson is one of the greatest lawyers in American history. He essentially apprenticed in law. A different time, for sure. Today, an era of credentialism, he‚Äôd never get away with it.
This ‚Äútradition,‚Äù concerning which there is little actual evidence, would operate as an invitation to partisans to threaten impeachment, and thereby block any nomination to the Court. It is founded on speculation, coincidence and frustration. https://t.co/khjcVLqjv2
@jedshug Court observers have noticed a slight shake developing in Justice Kennedy‚Äôs arm; he tries to hide it. Also, without getting specific, I can tell you his wife was unwell recently; Kennedy spent a lot of time with her. He‚Äôs 81; he and Mary have known each other since childhood.
@jedshug Rank ‚Äúspeculation.‚Äù Stevens served until 2010! And he was at the Court last week hiring law clerks for next year...and the next year, when he will be 100 years old. It‚Äôs false to say this man‚Äîstill spry and sharp at 98, though a bit hard of hearing‚Äîwas ready to retire in 1977.

@imitationsun @2AEvanTX @mattklewis @RedHenLex It depends. My own feeling, as I said, is that the move embraces the Trumpian impulse to degrade our shared civic space. And this: segregation was American apartheid, enshrined in law and enforced with murder. Trumpism is a political orientation. There‚Äôs a difference, I think.
@imitationsun @2AEvanTX @mattklewis @RedHenLex Isn‚Äôt there a huge difference between sit-ins, where the powerless force the powerful to exercise their immoral power and pay the spiritual price for it‚Äîand kicking someone out of the restaurant you own? It‚Äôs not MLK. It‚Äôs a surrender to Trump‚Äôs America, not a refutation of it.

@imitationsun @2AEvanTX @mattklewis @RedHenLex I see. To me, entering the market created and sustained by our nation‚Äôs diversity entails civic responsibilities as well as property rights.

@2AEvanTX @imitationsun @mattklewis @RedHenLex That‚Äôs not what SCOTUS ruled.

@PLMay None. It was an offensive and disgraceful thing to say. But why do so many people insist on always look backwards to 2016? Live today, build a better future. Be best.
The blatant dehumanization of any person is wrong. For me, every person has infinite dignity in the loving eyes of God. That does not mean that every person is a good person, or a "very fine" person. It means that every man is my brother, whom I am called to love.
@MZHemingway That may well be true. Or they couls be following the most recent DoJ constitutional guidance on the subject, the 2000 memo from the Office of Legal Counsel memo. Read it here: https://t.co/0rnV9K5yH5

@mopenshaw You don‚Äôt know the facts. The Netanyahu presentation offered zero evidence of an Iranian nuclear program post-2009. The JCPOA was signed in 2015.
This is 100 percent correct.  Under both US and international law, Trump‚Äôs move today is perfectly lawful.  Whether it is wise is another discussion altogether. https://t.co/UCsDgiBacv

@mopenshaw The IAEA has verified Iranian compliance with this deal ten times.  And Defense Secretary Mattis‚Äîjust last month‚Äîtold Congress he had carefully reviewed the agreement, including the classified verification protocols used by the IAEA, and found them ‚Äúrobust.‚Äù https://t.co/HJmmiYZ7kC
Does President Trump want to negotiate a new Iran deal? Or does he really want regime change in Tehran?   And could that be achieved by anything short of another major war in the Middle East?
‚ÄúI am ready willing and able‚Äù to cut a new deal with Iran, Trump declares.
The key question for Trump now: How does the US‚Äîhaving rejected the counsel of allies and now standing alone in the world‚Äîpropose to stop an Iranian nuclear weapon?
‚ÄúThe Iran Deal is defective at its core,‚Äù Trump declares.
@DouthatNYT If true--a big if--then a bribe has been paid to Trump while he was president. I hope it's not true, in part because I think we need to get back to the business of the country, but also because it would represent a test of the congressional GOP that I am not sure it would pass.

@okcitynews Yes, Mueller‚Äôs role as special counsel is perfectly constitutional. He is an employee of the Department of Justice, part of the executive branch of our government, under Article II of our Constitution.
@MariaBo08160553 @ReaganBattalion Flynn plead guilty to a felony.
@okcitynews 2/2 After I noted Mueller‚Äôs history of Senate confirmations, you called him a ‚Äúbureaucrat,‚Äù then dismissed my recounting of the appointments clause as ‚Äúold school.‚Äù Instead, you hailed Trump. We have a beautiful, complex constitutional system. Trump is part of it; so is Mueller.
@okcitynews You need to study our constitutional system, read some Supreme Court precedents. I described with precision the Framers‚Äô plan to make ‚Äúofficers of the United States‚Äù accountable to the people‚Äîthe ‚Äúappointments clause,‚Äù it‚Äôs called. Try Scalia‚Äôs 1991 concurrence in Freytag. 1/2
@MariaBo08160553 @ReaganBattalion Of course you are free. As am I. We are exchanging our opinions. That‚Äôs how a healthy democracy works.  Gen. Flynn served his country with great honor and distinction. Until he didn‚Äôt‚Äîas his own felony guilty plea acknowledges.
@okcitynews If you think constitutional governance is old school‚Äîyou are wrong.
@4waterbear @InvestigateRU For someone who quotes scholastic philosophy, that is an incredibly stupid thing to say. Like describing the Investiture Controversy as a disagreement over clerical fashion.
@MariaBo08160553 @ReaganBattalion It is extremely rare. If by "think alike" you mean recognize the integrity and ability of a man who served our nation with honor and bravery in war, and continued to serve in public office for decades, including restructuring the FBI after 9/11 to protect our homeland--yes.
@okcitynews Every senator is also elected by the American people. And in their name, senators advise and consent to presidents' nominations of men and women to serve in the most important offices in our government. Very few have won the kind of bipartisan support across decades Mueller has.
Robert Mueller has been confirmed unanimously by the US Senate four times: 1990 Assistant AG under Bush 41 (unanimous consent) 1999 US Atty in CA under Clinton (voice vote) 2001 FBI Director under Bush 43 (confirmed 98-0)  2011 reappointment as FBI Director under Obama (100-0)

@DevinGordonX @jackshafer You don‚Äôt get a pass on being cruel because you aren‚Äôt the president. And the WHCA dinner was by tradition not a roast. A bit of a singe at best.
@DevinGordonX @jackshafer The argument that ‚ÄúTrump does it, so it‚Äôs OK if we do it‚Äù is, to me, a surrender to the hatred of the Trump era. To see liberals rush to become the worst version of themselves because Trump is the worst version of himself is a defeat for the democracy I‚Äôd like to live in.
@DevinGordonX @jackshafer I live in London. I have nothing to do with White House coverage. I called out what I thought was uncivil cruelty. I know these days we are all supposed to cheer hatefulness when our team does it, and gin up outrage when it‚Äôs the other side. But I don‚Äôt play that.
@RandyEBarnett Look, I slammed Wolf for her unfunny hatefulness. But let‚Äôs be honest here: the GOP not only normalized uncivil crudity. They nominated it for president.

@jpodhoretz Doesn‚Äôt matter. Either way, the court should have been told it was paid political dirt from the presidential campaign. We should want FISA judges to have the full story. Th judge might weigh the evidence differently. Might consider First Amendment implications.etc
@schwanderer No doubt there was SIGINT and maybe HUMINT. But context is crucial to these decisions. We should want the FISA court to have the full story before it approves a request to spy on an American citizen in the US, especially when that person is involved in a political campaign.
@Robertwaldeck The judge cannot take notice of things outside the court process.   I agree the renewals are significant.  But if in 2008 the FBI requested surveillance of Susan Rice based on an oppo research dossier funded by the Koch Brothers‚Äîwell, I'd want the judge to know that, too.
@MelissaMermaid I did not say it came from one partisan side or the other. The judge should have been told it was paid political oppo dirt. Context. We should want the FISA court to have the full story before it approves of domestic spying.
@twitting999 I did not say it came from one partisan side or the other. The judge should have been told it was paid political oppo dirt. Context. We should want the FISA court to have the full story before it approves of domestic spying.
@wogletree I did not say it came from one partisan side or the other. The judge should have been told it was paid political oppo dirt. Context. We should want the FISA court to have the full story before it approves of domestic spying.
@stuartadel I did not say it came from one partisan side or the other. The judge should have been told it was paid political oppo dirt. Context. We should want the FISA court to have the full story before it approves of domestic spying.
This is where Trump has a legit beef with the FBI, and I‚Äôll bet the FISC judge is pissed about it, too. The court should have been told that this warrant was based in part on oppo research stemming from the campaign. https://t.co/H4vZS0QmLw

@JenWoodruff79 @luvofUSA @AshaRangappa_ @just_security Why not? Why is inviting you to read something that struck me as helpful evidence that I am against transparency. I'm just suggesting you read MORE. Get MORE info. About how the process works. That's all. It's not scary. It's just an article.
@ysBones @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I'm simply inviting you to read something. Sheesh, if I had known that would have terrified you so much, I would have put an adults-only warning on it!
@WaynesterAtl @RichardGrenell @JammieWF Shape your own narrative. If you want to do it after reading more perspectives and context on the historical practice of obtaining FISA warrants, fine. If not--that's fine, too. Hope you have a nice day.
@MMouseUSA @RichardGrenell I thought at the time and continue to think that HRC's private server was a shady and selfish move, a dereliction of her duty, an incredibly arrogant attempt to evade public accountability for her work in the public sector. So there.
@ebc2017ebc @RichardGrenell It means understanding the actual historical practice of obtaining a FISA warrant. It means putting the memo in a factually accurate context, rather than simply hollering at each other about it. It's like learning about a business before investing in it.
@Mildredhrn4 @RichardGrenell Americans are wicked smart. That's why I'm not afraid to release the memo. Or recommend we all learn a bit more about how the FISA process actually works, so we can use our excellent minds to assess its significance. And--I never mentioned gender. That's a bullshit evasion.
@jg091297 @JammieWF @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I can't speak for others. I've never treated the FBI like a holy cow. It's a government agency--works well sometimes, not so well at other times. All I would ask is that people delve a little deeper into the FISA process, to help them judge what happened here.
@RichardGrenell Not at all. I'm fine with releasing the memo. I'm suggesting we all get MORE info. MORE debates and discussion about its significance. MORE reporting on the historical practice of the FISA process it focuses on. Why would you be uncomfortable with more info/perspectives?
@luvofUSA @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I'm perfectly fine with the memo being released. And fine with people debating and discussing its significance from all kinds of perspectives. And fine with reporting on the context and historical practice of the FISA process it focuses on. The more info, the better.
@JammieWF @AshaRangappa_ @just_security I'm perfectly fine with releasing this memo. And fine with people debating and discussing it from all kinds of perspectives. And fine with reporting on the context and practice of the FISA process it discusses. It's you who seem to fear additional info.
@SneakyBlackDog @GenghisKhet @JammieWF @AshaRangappa_ @just_security It's about understanding the actual historical practice of obtaining a FISA warrant. The context. That's like saying, "Why do I need announcers when I watch baseball?"--when this is the first ballgame you've ever watched. Why be afraid of context?
@FromFlyover @AshaRangappa_ @just_security No. It's an invitation to read and learn about the actual historical practice and legal context of the process of obtaining a FUSA warrant, so the Nunes memo can be assessed from a point of deeper understanding. Why would you be so afraid of that information?
@SprayCanAnn @AshaRangappa_ @just_security Maybe. But the writer is attempting to describe a fact of federal practice in this area: Federal judges aren't idiots. She used sarcasm to make the point. But I've been in plenty of federal courtrooms--and she's right. Once in a while, you get a rummy. But most are pros.
@Mildredhrn4 @AshaRangappa_ @just_security Why reject a deeper level of discussion on the context and historical practice of how FISA warrants are obtained by federal prosecutors? No one said anything about gender. That's a bullshit evasion.  Sure, release the memo. And then read it with an informed perspective.

Bipartisan applause on paid family leave and vocational education.
Democratic leaders sit stone-faced, signalling they won't do an infrastructure deal with Trump. Most voters will not understand that.
Trump knows that the dumbest thing the left ever did in America, back in the 1960s, was to surrender the symbols of American patriotism to the right. That's changed, but the legacy lingers.  "If you want a symbolic gesture, don't burn the flag; wash it."  --Norman Thomas

So true.  The one conversation I ever had with my dad about sex--I was 18, setting off for college--lasted only a minute or so, and consisted almost entirely of the following words, spoken slowly and accompanied by a steely gaze: "I expect you, at all times, to be a gentleman." https://t.co/SAbpGDXnvH

@R_Love317 @guypbenson No. But why should some businesses--craft beer makers, private equity, cruise lines, real estate developers--get favored tax treatment, but not others? Because they have influence and donate tons of campaign $$$. That's no way to "reform" the tax code.
@laddydogH @guypbenson Pass through provisions. Carried interest. Excise tax relief for some businesses, not others. REIT treatment. Accelerated depreciation. Etc.
@FrozenTumtum https://t.co/JSW3nD3hCH
@elgato_57 Loopholes were multiplied--the pass-through provisions, for instance. Take a look. Also, the egregious carried-interest provision remains, Trump breaking a campaign promise on that one. ETC
@boplowden https://t.co/JSW3nD3hCH
@boplowden And economists will tell you that when the government tries to choose winners and losers through the tax code it distorts economic choices and invites rent-seeking behaviors based on tax avoidance opportunities rather than wealth creation. Conservatives used to understand this.
@EndDeepState No. That's not the way it works. When you close loopholes tax revenues will go up. So you can slash rates. A helluva lot. Reagan's '86 bill took the top income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. THAT'S tax reform.
@boplowden That's not an economic policy argument. Just ad hominem expectoration. Plus a little snark and snobbery. It's Twitter. I shouldn't expect better.
@boplowden When it comes to tax reform, I'm a Reaganite. I covered the '86 bill, thought it a great legislative achievement, making our tax code both more efficient and more just. And done through bipartisan leadership. Trump hated it. Natch.
@RandyEBarnett I'm all for cutting taxes. The question is: How? This bill--with all its new loopholes--actually reflects the belief that government is all-wise, that politicians can determine that some people's income is better than others, some economic choices better. Reagan this ain't.
Lower rates are good. Adding more loopholes and tax shelters is bad. They encourage more people to make economic decisions based on tax avoidance rather than wealth creation. Our tax code hobbles our economy with inefficient incentives. This bill makes that problem worse.
@laddydogH @guypbenson Lower rates are good. Adding more loopholes and tax shelters is bad. They encourage more people to make economic decisions based on tax avoidance rather than wealth creation. Our tax code hobbles our economy with inefficient incentives. This bill makes that problem worse.
@guypbenson The bill cuts individual rates--a bit; corporate rates--a lot. That's sound policy. But tax reform this ain't. The pass-through and carried interest provisions are incoherent. Plus--more tax shelters! It's really just industrial policy/special-interest giveaways using the code.
@NotMe91422 @jbouie Yes. Both Democrats and Republicans have for decades larded up the tax code with complexities simply to reward their donors and burden those they disfavor. The result is a code that is both less efficient and less just. This bill is no different. The Swamp won again.
@Bluewater22 @guypbenson Absolutely nothing--since 1986, when Dan Rostenkowski, Bill Bradley and other Dems worked with Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp and other Reps to slash tax rates and close thousands of loopholes. The '86 bill made the code more efficient and more just. Trump hated it--back then.
Democrats and Republicans for decades have larded up the tax code with complexities simply to reward donors. This bill is no different. It incentivizes even more economic behavior to focus on tax avoidance rather than wealth creation. More industrial policy enforced by the IRS.
@TeelowM3 Sanders is talking about the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That is a different metric than the Gross Domestic Product. I compared apples to apples; you, apples to autos. And, yes, Obama inherited an economy in free-fall; Trump, a stable, slow-growing  economy. #facts
In percentage terms--the relevant measure--the market went up by a lot more in Obama's first 11 months than in Trump's. https://t.co/TPAtsaqUar
@guypbenson The real problem is that the GOP squandered here a rare opportunity to simplify and flatten the tax code, thus rendering it both more efficient and more just. Instead, they larded more complexity, inefficiency, and corruption into the code. The Swamp won. Bigly.

@guypbenson Also important to note: The woman who alleges Moore engaged in unlawful sexual contact with her when she was 14 made contemporaneous reports to two friends, and told her mother a few years ago--long before Moore's political career.

@ABL1994 And if you think a self-serving, post-facto email from a Hollywood mogul in frantic CYA mode is the gospel truth--I've got a bridge to sell.
@ABL1994 You need to get a clue. Agents KNEW,after clients complained. Journalists KNEW. Stars KNEW. Shit, Seth MacFarlane and 30 Rock JOKED ABOUT IT
@annegrace_C I am referring to the countless MEN who KNEW--agents, producers, stars, journalists--and said NOTHING.
@GordianSlots @JamesCarville How would you possibly know that? On what basis would you claim that? I backed Paula Jones' suit; I reviled Carvile's comment. So STFU.
@annegrace_C They condemn conservative harassers, but obey a code of silence for powerful liberals. It undermines their outrage on the issue.
Power corrupts. It corrupts the left and right. And, while both sides prattle on about how much they care about "real people," they don't.
Monster. Liberal Hollywood's omert√†, while smugly ( if rightly) condemning Trump, Ailes, O'Reilly, etc is appalling. https://t.co/mP6R2tKDuf

@redsteeze A) I'm not saying that. B) The Alexander/Murray route might help. C) You've got the votes! Pass your own bill.
@redsteeze So Jimmy Kimmel now runs the GOP? Trump, McConnell, Ryan--they've handed over all their power to him? Governing is hard.
@redsteeze Now THAT'S a dodge. ;)
@redsteeze Not meant to be. Seems straightforward. Are you saying that there is absolutely nothing the GOP could do and we are all doomed? Seems wrong.
@redsteeze OK. There's 52 GOP votes.Do the hard work of writing a bill that would get 50 of them. Or try the Alexander/Murray bipartisan route. Govern.
@redsteeze And governing is hard. We sued to know that, and, in fits and starts and stumbles, do it. Now it's all kibitzing and tweets and hollering.
@redsteeze The vote was strictly partisan. The process was far more open.
@redsteeze And maybe the old processes of holding hearings and debates would surface good ideas, refine them, gain support. You know--governing!
@redsteeze https://t.co/KVkbePyahD

@redsteeze https://t.co/sXqhKOvtoH
@redsteeze It didn't do all it promised. Many predicted that. So it needed either fixes (Democrats) or a complete replacement (GOP). That's governing.

@LolaScarpitta Sure. But, for me, the premium exceeds the value delivered by a wide margin. And I've run into more than a few cabbies who tried to cheat me
Black cabs rule the streets unchallenged by any meaningful competition. Dual taps in the sinks. Britain out of Europe. The Stargazers at #1.
@PunditFight @PatrickRuffini London black cabs are a total rip-off.
@Morten15 @PatrickRuffini No Lyft in London. And TfL killed Taxify after only 3 days. This is not about corporate ethics, but protecting the powerful cabbies' unions.
@chenenko @PatrickRuffini In London? Taxify tried. Authorities shut it down in three days. This is about protecting the cabbies and the city's $$.
@marcelvandenber Yes, Uber's business practices are troubling. But this isn't about corporate ethics. Taxify's not Uber. This is special-interest regulation.
Uber banned in London. Taxify banned, too. Now the wildly expensive black cabs will rule the roads again without meaningful competition.

Trump hates the Iran nuke deal--but most world leaders think it stopped yet another war in the Middle East. #UNGA
Trump declares the US is ready " to destroy North Korea." That's an immoral threat. Threaten vicious regimes, not innocent people.

@texaninpa Not true. I loved when he called terrorists "losers," and his tough talk to Carrier Inc. on shipping jobs overseas. But this is a falsehood.

@jeff_jara But they won. A lot. The reward for that in democracy is the initiative. Obamacare wasn't perfect--Dems opening bid. The fix will lean GOP.
@jeff_jara GOP controls Congress--because they win. So they get the opening bid. The public shot it down. There's a middle ground. We used to do this.
@jeff_jara Because the health-care system needs fixing. Obama: If Republicans come up with a fix that works--and call it "Trumpcare"--he'll support it.
@PatrickRuffini And whichever party succeeds in escaping identity politics--academic PC-ism or soft white nationalism--wins for a generation.

@klcmurphy @aravosis Yes. That's not "brain dead," a term easily abused. Other doctors thought differently. The parents wanted to go in a different direction.
@pdxusr @aravosis Charlie's parents say they see a different child. They do not believe he is suffering. They say if he was, they'd let him go. Not fanatics.
@pdxusr @aravosis Totally agree. The parents are close observers of their son, too. They have a different vector of insight. Not invalid.
@BBCDanielS And so my question: Is the state more likely to intervene in working-class and middle-class families than in the families of the privileged?
@pdxusr @aravosis Read the case? The evidence of suffering offered by the hospital was that Charlie was intubated. Painful, yes. But millions live with it.
@klcmurphy @aravosis The child was not "brain dead." The evidence of suffering was that he was intubated--like millions of people. Many things can't be cured.
@aravosis The hospital decided it was in the best interest of the child that he die. The parents disagreed. The court sided with the hospital. UK law.
@BBCDanielS Will do. Yes, the state has far more power in family law in the U.K. The threshold for state intervention in families is much higher in US.
@aravosis His parents raised $1.3 million to pay for every dime of his treatment.
@BBCDanielS You covered it fully. I just read J. Francis's decision, and the 1989 law. Sometimes what's legal isn't what's right.And privilege matters.

@sdc0155 Yes--but a president's power to self-pardon has never been tested. Nixon's lawyers thought it was legal. Might be. SCOTUS would decide.
@BPOGrady The American people. It's probably going to be a political fight.
@sdc0155 Actually, no. Prospective pardons have long been considered constitutional. President Ford pardoned Nixon prospectively.
@BPOGrady Not clear. But there's a case to be made that the Constitution does grant the president that kind of authority.
@NotoriousRBF That would be up to congressional Republicans. In 1974--after years of revelations--Republicans on Judiciary Committee stood by Nixon, 11-6.
@AndeeBarenholtz Nixon almost pardoned himself. His lawyer told him he had the presidential power to do so. But Ford did it instead.
@NotoriousRBF Maybe you're right. Maybe not. Scholars say it is a very close question. The Roberts Court is a wild card. so? https://t.co/XNm1dsSKXQ
@SeanTrende And then he'll pardon everyone, including himself. And a GOP majority will back him.
I could see Trump firing Mueller, Rosenstein and whomever--then pardoning Don, Jared, Manafort and himself.And the GOP majority going along.
Thanks! https://t.co/2g8KNWuACG

@ThunderB Haven't looked at that issue closely. I'd want to hear from cops themselves on this. But at first glance, what you say makes sense to me.
It's character, not nationality, that separates good cops from bad cops. Police work is hard. It takes courage, judgment, nerve. Character.
People are reaching for stereotypes in the Minneapolis police shooting. Some guys--Somalis, Americans, etc--shouldn't have a badge or a gun.
@RefugeeWatcher @ScottMcConnell9 I've covered cop shootings. Sometimes, not often, it's simply a guy who never should've had a badge or a gun. Character, not nationality.
@GrammaYayam164 One Somalia guy. Other police shootings have involved Americans who also shouldn't have had a badge or gun. It's character, not nationality.
Minneapolis police shooting looks grimly familiar:Some guys shouldn't have a badge or a gun.Police work is hard. Demands courage. Character.

@wideawakelife @brianstelter @ReliableSources The public has a right to answers from their servants in the White House. But there's no commandment decreeing it all has to be on TV.
@wideawakelife @brianstelter @ReliableSources I might not like it. But it's his presidency/term in office. That's the way the Constitution works. The press has no right to be on TV.
@ScottPorch @brianstelter @ReliableSources The point of Q&amp;A is to elicit a meaningful answer. Camera on or off, many tactics help: Reportorial, rhetorical, performative. Get an answer
@brianstelter @ReliableSources The point is to make sure the president and his staff face questions; answer them. Seems to me Trump's WH does. His choice how. He's POTUS.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Why should the press insist on televised briefings as a matter of right? In an age of podcasts and social media and limitless text--why TV?
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Why not? Seriously. There are many different ways of being president. The press can't dictate that. Trump and his staff answer a lot of Qs.
@RonBrownstein Because they have to win back working- and middle-class Americans in states very different from California. Maybe she can. Maybe she can't.

@SeanTrende @RadioFreeTom @nonfamousjay Wasn't it coined to describe demonstrably false stories (e.g. Pizzagate)? He twists it to mean--a story I don't like, even if it's factual.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS It has everything to do with country over party. History will show that--however this all turns out.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Country over party. The real American way. Good night.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Wow. Even after the tapes reveal Nixon directly ordering crimes from the Oval Office? Here is where we disagree. For me--country over party.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson You don't believe President Trump's own DCI/DNI? You don't think they have evidence to say DNC servers were attacked by Russia? So be it.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Not in June '72.And right up to 1974, Nixon supporters--blinded by their partisan loyalties--demanded an end to the investigation. Familiar?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Again: President Trump's own DCI and DNI have confirmed in testimony that Russian intelligence agencies--GRU/FSB--carried out DNC hack.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson And the DNC. Again: President Trump's own DCI and DNI have confirmed this attack. It is a fact.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Sure. It was wrong. Let's investigate by all means. If those involved (Dems or GOP) have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS Also--do you think no US laws were broken? The DNC hack alone is a violation of federal laws. Hacking is a serious crime.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS No one tied Nixon to the break-in at first. No one suspected Nixon was involved in Watergate nine months after it happened. We investigated.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Trump's own DCI and DNI have confirmed publicly it was Russia, based on their knowledge of classified evidence. All leads should be followed
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson A mountain of targeted disinformation. Also--cyberattacks may have been furthered but US persons.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Why are you so afraid?Do you think Trump has something to hide?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson But the attack went far beyond technology. There was disinformation, cyberattacks, likely espionage. And possible involvement by US persons.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS There was no evidence of any crime by Richard Nixon in June 1972--even though he committed one on June 21.It took an investigation to reveal
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS It is the opinion of DCI/DNI that our country was attacked. There is evidence that might--MIGHT--show US persons involved. So: Investigate.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS You don't start with a crime. You end with it--a jury verdict. You start with probable cause--reasonable suspicion. Then dig, without fear.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS He did nothing we know of. There are facts which involve people close to him--Manafort, Kushner, Trump Jr. "Leads." You follow them.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson These aren't talking points. They're my ideals. As for logic--let's find out the facts. That's logical. Anyway, late here.Nice talking. Bye.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson @POTUS I disagree. Mueller is a stand-up guy. Unanimously confirmed by Senate. I truly hope Trump is cleared, runs again in a fair 2020 election.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson The FBI is the DOJ, led by Sessions, who recused himself. And appointed Mueller.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson It's more than cyber. This was a classic 21st Century, Putin-designed attack. I saw similar ops in Crimea, Poland, even here in UK.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson I am not on a soapbox. I am looking for the common ground Americans used to share more easily: Love of our country. Instead, you hurl scorn.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Also, Ruth, there is also a difference between what is legal and what it is right. Voters have a right to know what happened here.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson I see no evidence of crime by them at all at this point. But why short-circuit the investigation into a major attack on our country?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson I see no evidence of crime by them at all at this point. But why short-circuit the investigation into a major attack on our country?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson We must get to the bottom of the Russian attack on the USA--confirmed by Trump's DCI/DNI. And go where the evidence leads--without fear.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson It's unfair for you to hurl that insult at me. We are on the same team! USA! We can disagree. But we must defend this country TOGETHER.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson IN NO WAY DO I WANT THE ELECTION OVERTURNED! That would be a disaster for the country I love. And I respect Trump's voters--THEY WON!
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Please don't let your own politics weaken the defense of the United States against this kind of 21st Century attack. It's real. #America
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Totally agree this must not be a "coup" of ANY kind. But it is much more than cybersecurity. Disinformation, espionage, hacking, etc.#Putin
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson We are investigating the Russian attack on the 2016 election, confirmed by Trump's DCI and DNI. Why? Because we love our country, that's why
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson We are investigating the Russian attack on the 2016 election, confirmed by Trump's DCI and DNI. Why are we doing it? Because we love America
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Haven't we gone over this? So: What? The Russian attack on the 2016 election, confirmed by Trump's DCI, DNI. Why? Because we love America.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson There is no hard evidence now that Trump was involved. The investigation is about the attack; if he had nothing to do with it, he's fine.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson No one should let their partisan support or opposition to Trump distort this necessary investigation. Let it proceed,with secrecy and order.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson It demonstrated our vulnerabilities.Defending our country means investigating how.Again: Trump won fair and square.But let's defend the USA!
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson But this is a significant challenge to the USA.We need to get to the bottom of it. No American should have anything to fear from the truth.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Don't be afraid! Our system works! Believe me, I think it'd be best if all this turns out to be nothing, and we have a good election in '20.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Ask Trump's appointees, DCI Pompeo and DNI Coats. Both have said the classified evidence is clear: Russia attacked the US election.
@rhill22733 @WildBill4701 @guypbenson If a person claiming to represent the government of a hostile foreign power asked me if they could help me attack my country--I'd say no.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Who said such a thing? Not me. If you voted for Trump--good! You and I may or may not agree. But we can together defend the USA.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Who said such a thing? Not me. If you voted for Trump--good! You and I may or may not agree. But we can together defend the USA.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson And the attack is in large part Obama's fault; it happened on his watch, after all. Let's get ALL the facts. Why are you afraid to do that?
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Trump won. Hillary lost. That's a fact. AND Russia attacked us. That's a fact. I don't know why any patriot would deny it.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Consistent, targeted cyberattacks/disinformation from GRU/FSB accounts. Targeted attacks on voting machines--failed. This is all documented.
@rhill22733 @vShockAndAwev @guypbenson Tell that to Woodward/Bernstein.Sy Hersh. Ida Tarbell. Stanley Nelson.So many other journalists who dug out the truth without fear or favor.

@MyPlace4U @redsteeze Kiev is not. Sanctions slowed him down. I was there.
@FJ473 @GomesBolt @redsteeze I've never said "Russian collusion; see no hard evidence of it. But, given the attack, the investigation should continue. Why cut it short?
@hellion2172 @redsteeze No! When was the last time you were in Russia?
@KeystoneObsrvr @redsteeze Absolutely. But so did sanctions. Ask any Russian economist. It was a double-whammy. And Putin did not expect Europe to go along.
@GomesBolt @redsteeze Yes. He paid a price he was willing to pay. The sanctions--especially in Europe--probably slowed him down some in Ukraine. No easy answers.

@charlescwcooke The words were Jeffersonian, Wilsonian, Reaganesque. But do you think Trump believes them? His record ought to give you pause before praise.
@MZHemingway But "to go Zapruder" is an excellent neologism.
@MZHemingway Agreed. The whole episode was stupidly exaggerated by CNN and others. But "funny"? No. It's puerile and hateful. Like so much else today.

@ThunderB @MZHemingway My point was that one reason some people get angry at the media is that they can't stand the truth. Iraq was a case in point.

Trump will declare victory on travel ban. But all liberal justices joined this opinion. Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch wanted much more.
@PatrickRuffini If you're serious: Howard Schultz. Eric Garcetti. Brian Schweitzer. Tim Kaine.
There's nothing hip or amusing about assassinating the president. And there's nothing hip or amusing about beating your wife.
Trump's election was a verdict on neo-liberal economics and post-Cold-War interventionism. Until Democrat candidates answer that--they lose.

@jpodhoretz @KirstenPowers Yes. They're our enemies.
@jpodhoretz @KirstenPowers An ideal--I certainly fall short of it often. But it seems we've given ourselves permission to be hateful to each other politically.
@jpodhoretz @KirstenPowers Yes. But aren't some emotions--if we permit ourselves to vent them--destructive of solidarity? Isn't there an ideal of civic comportment?
@KirstenPowers Hatred in politics corrodes civic solidarity. It is toxic--destructive of the respectful debates without which democracy is impossible.
@PatsyWilliams1 @ABC No. I do not hate. I raise my children never to use the word. I am sorry you feel that, and I will try to do better.
@PatsyWilliams1 Which friends? I hate no one. But you lash out at me--a person you do not know. That's wrong. We are not enemies. You are my fellow citizen.

@janetbussi Obama himself spoke of his regrets and sense of futility about Syria. And many in his administration thought his Syria policy a failure.
It is so clear that Putin, Lavrov and the Kremlin elite really, really hated Obama. Almost as much as many of you here on Twitter. Almost.
Did the Trump administration learn nothing from Obama's mistakes? Tillerson is calling for regime change in Syria. Great powers don't bluff.
Waste of time and energy. Also--Harry Truman was right: the buck stops with POTUS--the current POTUS. Period.
Blaming Bush didn't make Obama any better of a president. Blaming Obama won't make Trump any better a president, either.
@Shanemober Lavrov and Kerry were pals. The Kremlin saw Kerry as an experienced guy working for Obama--whom they really hated.
@GregDjerejian Lavrov was downright rude, barely looked at him. And he seemed like he'd been saving stuff up to say to his face. But then, he's Russian. üòâ

@seanmdav @guypbenson @sahilkapur Dissimulation. For senators who have a constitutional responsibility for oversight: How can you trust him?
@mattyglesias @RichLowry I think Lincoln said it in the 1840s. He was a Whig. That was their platform.

@jimgeraghty Let's hope no one repeats what was one of the lowest moments in the modern history of the Congress.

Keanu rules. Everyone probably likes five Keanu movies--but won't admit it. https://t.co/KAQ7NhHIOm
For me, best movies this year were: 1) Hidden Figures; 2) Hell or High Water; 3) Hacksaw Ridge; 4)  Star Trek Beyond; 5) Trolls.
In his alarm at the percentage of Asian-American CEOs in Silicon Valley, he was off by at least 300 percent. Weird.  https://t.co/LwNdd3gbxI
What Does Steve Bannon Want? He's an original thinker. But his paranoia about Asian-American CEOs remains...odd. https://t.co/ZpXLsu3QR4
@Barbi_bb My friend survived that night. Went back when EODM returned. She's Parisian. She doesn't cower; knows her city--better than you.
The WHCA dinner is from a different time, a lost time. For better--and for worse--a dead time.
@TheAgedP @securitykartell @PrisonPlanet @ScottMcConnell9 I'll take Paris over London any day.
Happy Saturday. It's not the end of the world. It's just the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine. https://t.co/YGimWX98Xs
@lisa_gallazzi Like security around the White House. Or Trump Tower.
@securitykartell @PrisonPlanet @ScottMcConnell9 I've taken my family there on weekends twice in the past two years. We had so much fun.
@MarianneHaran "Approve"? Don't put words in my mouth. I dispute the notion that riots in Paris="collapse." And I cite history. Heard of it?
@ScottMcConnell9 @PrisonPlanet It's like Europeans who hear of mass shootings in America, and our murder rate, and say--"A slaughterhouse!"
@ScottMcConnell9 @PrisonPlanet Sure. But they were violent, trashed vast sections of the city, brought down governments. Paris endured.
@Just2Learn1234 It's open. I have a friend,there the night of the attack. She went back when EODM returned.She doesn't cower.She's Parisian.
@DFlaherty08 Curious: When was the last time you were there?
@RipperBravoSix Are you serious? Read some history. Start with 1968.
@FederalSpyGuy I'm in Paris all the time. I can assure you, "Federal Spy Guy," it's far from a sh*thole. Ask Parisians.
@Just2Learn1234 "Civilization collapse"?! Go change your diaper. And visit Paris. For reality's sake.

.@PrisonPlanet @ScottMcConnell9 You don't know the history of Paris very well. Riots in Paris are as Parisian as escargots and adultery.

So good to see @realDonaldTrump at the @NMAAHC. Presidential visits, gestures matter. Of course--policies matter more.Still, this was right.

@SWCCEM "Fancy words"? You argue on the level of a 3rd-grade kid falling behind in class: Triggered by vocabulary. Pathetic. Or: Sad!
@MindMappingMBA Love Archer. But if that's your response, then you are a disgrace to whatever position you are attempting to argue. Blocked.
@Deplorable_JJ @Terryoneill If that's supposed to be proof of a dangerous crime wave--it's a tendentious reading. Where's your data?
@KurtSchlichter Glad to see CPAC rescinded the invitation. Standing against the advocacy of sex with minors is just plain right.
@mjrod I'm exercising MY free speech to castigate moral cowards/Milo fanboys who lack the decency to condemn advocacy of sex with minors.
@Deplorable_JJ @Terryoneill OK. You show your research. Here's mine. The official numbers--crime is DOWN in Sweden: https://t.co/3EJHtrlAGO
@daveweigel That seems either disingenuous or functionally innumerate.
That #CPAC can't find the stones to reject the gruesomely ephebophiliac Milo shows how the word "conservative" has been vitiated of meaning.
The real falsehood told by President Trump in FL (and elsewhere) has nothing to do with Sweden: https://t.co/hPwJ5GlOWe
Stop with talk of impeachment/removal, absent solid evidence of actual crimes or provable incapacity.It's undemocratic and only helps Trump.

@jamestaranto That (snotty) insult is the same as the POTUS calling press "the enemy of the American people"? Weak.
@seanmdav No. It's more the equivalent of the "not my president" rejection of legitimacy. First time I heard that: Dick Armey on Clinton.
