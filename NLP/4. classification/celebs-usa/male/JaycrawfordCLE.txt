@ESPNCleveland @SolonSpine It‚Äôs not about restricting as much as educating. You teach kids habits you hope they‚Äôll carry into adulthood. Eating habits is the single biggest gift you can give your kids. Next is exercise. Together, they will build a foundation for a healthy life.

@R1ckMoran1s @JGbuckeye Under-delivered for a guy who said after beating warriors he‚Äôs the goat.
@Busterlouie1 @Yuda40857055 But.... they were... and lebron did win. Boom!
@ncjones_ @Yuda40857055 True greats. Top 5 all-time. Lebron can do things and has done things that neither can.
@mvrogers7 @Yuda40857055 Lol. KD burner account. Epic!
@whammer3000 @btkskeptic Someone has a reading comprehension problem.
@shabeck1206 @K_Breehl44 On the court it was lebron. Off it, wade/Riley had more to do with the rings.
@JGbuckeye @R1ckMoran1s This hits the nail on the head. Bingo
@Yuda40857055 Name one other player that led all 5 stat categories for an nba finals? Oh and did it against the team that set a new record for reg season wins. No one. And will NEVER be done again. No dispute. Greatest most diverse skill set ever. Just wish he was more of a leader.
@victor_withjerk He did plenty wrong in a Cleveland jersey. And has done plenty of great things in a heat and Lakers Jersey. I call each situation as I see em.
@mapplegate23 Who is talking about MJ??
@MB_Miller Try to. No chance. Home field edge is huge!!! Lol
@JackRobNDCL @C_Full19 TT got paid. Not sure he‚Äôs happy how the lebron tenure ended in cle. We‚Äôll have to see how many big $ free agents line up to sign in la in the off-season. In the past, they haven‚Äôt exactly beat his door down.
@MattMcNeill13 Must not have watched the game.
@JackRobNDCL Admire your conviction. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, talent-wise, no one better. No one. Ever. But being a great teammate is part of the total picture for the goat argument. Sadly his antics have detracted at times from his teams. Btw congrats on being named top 50! Big things for 2019
@JackRobNDCL @C_Full19 I can step in here. It‚Äôs happened. Multiple times. Sadly it‚Äôs become the norm. Teams can‚Äôt be constructed by someone in uniform. There is a real fear some players have of becoming his teammate. Which relationships have ended well?
@susanfisher33 Saddens me too. So much talent. So many self inflicted or nightmares.
@JackRobNDCL Lol.
@JackRobNDCL Pulling strings behind the scenes to trade away 6 of your teammates is never a good look.
@jgman5 @sills_33 Not at all. What typically happens in that instance is you bring it in. Did you watch the game? The most surreal game of lebron a career and that‚Äôs saying something.
@robsine Who made a case for mj? I think you brought him into this talk.
@R1ckMoran1s Did you watch that game? It was the most surreal game of his entire career. Not getting back on defense. The crowd chanting when other lakers were shooting free throws ‚Äúlebron wants to trade you‚Äù. All after the reports la was contemplating trading half its players for ad.
@JackRobNDCL Not completely true. He has sat right next to Luke at times. We all know the news that broke earlier that day that led to this. Not a good look.
@Kruzindirty That was my favorite lebron too.
@rupertdilig Yea. 9 trips to the finals gets you a ticket into that chat.
@JSPARK06 I never mentioned MJ.
I‚Äôll always maintain Lebron James has the best and most diverse skill set the game has ever seen. But this image  and the things that led to it will always give sufficient fuel to the argument of him not being the GOAT. https://t.co/ziTdNXtNIc

@R1ckMoran1s @Daryl87971978 @HeadHunterCorey Belichick factor. It‚Äôs the cause and is more than the jimmys and joes. Also, a field stretching receiving never hurts. To win this super bowl without one it was impairative those one be more about their defense. And it was.

@HeadHunterCorey Name his backs during his 9 super bowl run. I‚Äôll wait.
@JDomro1 @RobParkerFS1 Now imagine if he and Walsh had to deal with free agency.
@theterrylee @RobParkerFS1 Thanks man
Funny watching that Romo-Brady interview. Romo has already left football and climbed to the top of another profession while Brady is still at the top of his. Romo is 3 yrs younger than Brady.
@theterrylee @RobParkerFS1 Thanks man. Can‚Äôt say the feeling is mutual. Lol
@JDomro1 @RobParkerFS1 The rules were the same for everyone that played in that era. They are the same for everyone in this era. 9 is 9. 4 is 4. 4 is always way less than 9.
@RobParkerFS1 Don‚Äôt be silly Rob. 5 plus 4 equals 9. In the age of free agency. And 6 plus 3 also equals 9. This isn‚Äôt even a debate anymore. Not even close. Hope you‚Äôre well brother.

@machzurphy @KOCOAbigail @GottliebShow It doesn‚Äôt matter. You can practicing ball striking, position and leg speed.
@Blastcoachrick I‚Äôve seen many lineman kick fgs of 40 yds goofing off before and after practice. It‚Äôs not as uncommon as you‚Äôd think.
@Blastcoachrick @KOCOAbigail No idea. He clearly didn‚Äôt execute what he was going for. The play should‚Äôve been the conventional onside kick though.
@Blastcoachrick Anybody is too strong. But anybody with Nfl athletic ability fits.  And thanks man!!
@Philly_phan_5 @BmJohnson323 Exactly. Just stunned at the nfl level it can to that. Most coaches get it.
@DoubletuckFullT Lol. You make it sound like some Herculean athletic endeavor. Before you ask, yes, I‚Äôve tried it many times. I‚Äôm guessing the Seahawks have at least a dozen players that at some point have. What they did last night was, as buck/aikman said, a gift. See ya now
@machzurphy @KOCOAbigail @GottliebShow Ever see a kicking net on the sidelines. He was using one moments before. To practice a drop kick!
@Blastcoachrick @KOCOAbigail Anyone of moderate athletic ability, of which there were many on the Seahawks sidelines.
@Blastcoachrick I have. Many times.
@BmJohnson323 Use a tee.
@KOCOAbigail He‚Äôll say oh he‚Äôs the backup. He never onside kicked before. Blah blah blah. You knew for 5 minutes that could be in play. They showed him practicing drop kicks before the td. Just wow
@ZachThePT You onside kick. Period. 8% chance of working. Drop kick?!?!  Wow
@JamesonDaniels He gave his team a 0% chance. 0. I‚Äôm pretty sure you know 8 is higher than 0.
@r8hitman Pete‚Äôs the coach. Tell him to put the ball on the tee and kick the top of it. It‚Äôs simple!!! I‚Äôm just stunned right now. Gift.
Wow!!! What in the hell is pete Carroll thinking. ANYONE can onside kick. What did I watch?!

LOVE the call to go for 2!! Chargers played the 4th quarter to win. Chiefs played it not to lose. Major implications to those decisions on both sides. Chargers deserve that win! Division shaker!!! Great game!!

@Be_Led_ @Browns And the New Orleans game and the Pittsburgh game. Could easily be 8-5.

@DerekDeedok True.
@DerekDeedok That makes him a stronger candidate just so you know. Durable as hell at the most violent of positions.
@bdub237 She has also used Jr seau. He‚Äôs a great comparison. Brian was a slam dunk hall of famer. Here‚Äôs a guy that played at the same level...but for longer. She‚Äôs not dissing Brian at all. Just showing clays dominance by comparing his numbers to someone we all know was dominant.
Make it happen! It‚Äôs overdue. This man belongs in the HOF. https://t.co/4p7mdjIwbC
@1ash542 Might as well.

@chewyredding We all have a line of decency we define for ourselves. There is a basic code of behavior I expect from others. I define that, not you. Sorry. Treat others how you wish to be treated. Disrespect others, expect it in return. It‚Äôs very simple.
@chewyredding You should read all of them. You‚Äôll get my clear tone. It is always cordial until a line is crossed. Then they get what they get.
@__seanpatrick @lfoxcbus Bye Felicia.
@__seanpatrick @lfoxcbus Ohhhh he who judges without knowing makes grave mistakes often. You have absolutely no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Your speed to judge with slivers of info exposes your character once again.
No one said it would be easy. Loyalty is always rewarded. https://t.co/AcSnYRBB1o
@__seanpatrick @lfoxcbus I don‚Äôt recall saying he was.
Sticktoitivness. https://t.co/fXAL7taiSU
@tf0620 @matthewganson We‚Äôre even. I didn‚Äôt know who he was either. Hell, still don‚Äôt. He knows me now.
@lfoxcbus @__seanpatrick Shhhhh. You‚Äôre spoiling what wants to believe. Needs to believe. It‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been fed.
@tf0620 @matthewganson Blocked that mo. He was like a piece of gum on your shoe that had no stick to it.
@MatthewKripke Btw. 0-7.
@MatthewKripke As long as your ok with one day losing your job because one of your employees was accused but never convicted of something not work related, that‚Äôs cool.
@bcarrll15 It wouldn‚Äôt shock me.
Kindness. Share some. It goes a long way. https://t.co/glvckp1MOW
@MARKLAUR @rclark333 Perhaps.
@riptheory22 Follow the facts.
@OKLAHOMAsNATIVE 8 bids. 5 auto bids to the big 5 winners. 3 at large. Notre dame. Join the damn party. Getbin a league like everyone else. Absurd.
@KyroDC It‚Äôs what it‚Äôs become.
@jamiewhited0000 All good.
Best commencement address ever!  Please take the time to watch. American treasure. https://t.co/pr4f0gOyFu
@__seanpatrick Yep. You too.
@Kappykidd @tsrobbie No I caught it. lol. Was still responding to sarcasm.
@ChadEhrnsberger @espn Always good to hear from you Chad. I always try to be as fair as possible. I am human. I have favorites. We all are. Thanks again and hope you‚Äôre well.
@jamiewhited0000 Absolutely health is driving this. Naive to think August doesn‚Äôt factor in. He can‚Äôt say this. And won‚Äôt. He shouldn‚Äôt. But he‚Äôs human. And he felt he was treated unfairly.
@PerezAA805 @mitchusson You too Tony!
@Scoooter32 @relaxinallcoo @rkozey Urban committed no crime. Had no misdeed that raised to a fireable level. As for the 9 times. What was it after say 5 or 6 that made her stay? Financial reliance can‚Äôt be enough to stay in something that abusive. Women must leave. Please leave if it ever gets to this!!!
@__seanpatrick And some people see guilt when facts tell you otherwise. Follow the evidence always. And understand when he says, And she says, usually somewhere in the middle is where you find the truth.
@DocBunyan @rkozey Wise man! #wewereallbetteroffbeforetwitter
@Kappykidd @tsrobbie I prefer discussion over arguing. Debate TV has told us if we yell loudest we must be right. Measured, intelligent discussion is always my preference. It can devolve sadly. Prefer it not to though. Let‚Äôs all find common ground and build off of that. We can all be better! üëçüëç
@tsrobbie @Korosuzo84 You bet Todd!
@Frankiefingerz8 @rclark333 I see a man desperate to say what he needs to in order to reconcile. Kind of like a woman who claims abuse then insists there was none. Dropping charges where there was violence MUST STOP!!! Empower any woman you know or love to #STANDUPANDSTAYUP
@__seanpatrick Urban knew they had a volitale relationship and history of verbally abusing one another. Absent of charges, he fires him for that and he opens himself and university to a litany of legal fights he can‚Äôt win. Again, here‚Äôs to hoping you‚Äôre never fired for rumors or someone‚Äôs word.
@matthewganson Enjoy enlightening the under-educated and mis-informed. It‚Äôs become a form of entertainment for me chief. Bye Felicia. It‚Äôs been...  well it‚Äôs been.
@PerezAA805 @mitchusson See I raised both of my kids to follow my code of ethics. My moral compass. Hope was I did it well enough that some other adult, coach, teacher, etc, couldn‚Äôt undo my teachings. Jury‚Äôs still out. So far, I‚Äôve done good. Very proud of both my kids!
@__seanpatrick Sad truth is people abuse. And people lie. No one gets benefit of doubt because of duke. Each claim must be vigorously investigated &amp; adjudicated on its own merits. However, let duke lacrosse &amp; oj serve as cautionary tales on opposites sides of spectrum. Each case, on its own!
@Holywarriortim @Twitter @WYMT Thanks Tim. So many fond memories of WYMT days.
@javierroman3711 @ohiosportslead And thus, he must be fired. Sure hope your boss uses a different standard. Hell can you imagine the unemployment rate??
@MARKLAUR @rclark333 I figured that out.
@Kappykidd You‚Äôre right. He did. Which investigating committee, only ones who had ALL the facts, suggested his punishment be time served.  Pressure from media and social forced prez to do more. He did. Now he has a new coach. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all.
@Scoooter32 @relaxinallcoo @rkozey Your mind was cemented from jump. I get that. I wish for more open minds. Myself included. Media outcry? Listen to that. They are deemed by whom to have moral high ground on all things in question? We must be more careful than that. Our own public opinion polls confirm that.
@JimmyBozz @Stuckey__ Agreed. We all should do better. Perfection is a high bar. Many of his players are living productive and incredible lives. But you see, that just doesn‚Äôt get clicks. So boring.
@tsrobbie @Kappykidd I will make an announcement when my non compete finally expires. Enjoyed the back and forth. Let‚Äôs agree on one more thing. To each do our best daily to make this planet better. We owe it to mankind to do this. Peace friend. Happy Holidays.
@matthewganson And I‚Äôve never heard of you. Probably won‚Äôt butbthat doesn‚Äôt disqualify you of having an opinion. I‚Äôm only a free agent as I enjoy the last year of my non compete clause. I certainly hope you enjoy yours.
@pmason03 @ohiosportslead Thank you Pam. Appreciate the kind words.
@__seanpatrick Couldn‚Äôt agree more with the end of your statement. Dead on!!  That said. I‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt believe the duke lacrosse survivor. Whew! Bullet dodged there!
@PerezAA805 @mitchusson We‚Äôve degraded to name calling now? That disqualifies you from further intelligent conversation. Have a blessed day.
@tsrobbie @Korosuzo84 Name calling?  Chief?  Come on now. Take your faux outrage elsewhere. I have an itchy block finger.
@Frankiefingerz8 @rclark333 Educate yourself on that please. He vehemently denies hitting her. But you, nor I can‚Äôt possibly know what happened. He does. She does. They have wildly differing stories. Those called in to investigate side with him. However, doesn‚Äôt make it fact.
@Scoooter32 @relaxinallcoo @rkozey Read what their response was to the 9 calls. They are not martial arbiters. If there is real DV taking place and the facts substantiate such, charges must be filed. And never dropped by alleged victim. That‚Äôs what ensures our system works.
@Kappykidd Driving home the importance of pressing charges. No one gets a pass on DV. EVER! We‚Äôve seen what that can lead to. We must empower women to stand by charges when they are real. For their own safety. I have a daughter. I certainly hope she would.
@tf0620 I do not.
@ohiosportslead Thanks.
@__seanpatrick I don‚Äôt. I represent myself and my views only. You can‚Äôt expect one person to advocate for an entire group. That sir would be unfair. And I‚Äôm certain you would not want that.
@Stuckey__ That is as fair as I know how to be. But for what it‚Äôs worth I would not want me or someone with my bias determining real justice in this. I‚Äôm too close to the fire. Likewise, I wouldn‚Äôt want a Michigan fan dispensing it either.
@Stuckey__ I admit my bias. It is undeniable. I am trying on this issue to be as fair as I know how to be. I believe there was enough to warrant Zach‚Äôs firing. He was fired. Did it raise to a criminal level? Apparently not. This is why I feel asking Urban to die on that hill is unjust.
@SoulFulOfShyt I love it when folks get it. You get it. Logic. Reason. Fair. Justice. Words twitter could use more of.
@tsrobbie @relaxinallcoo Yea. Really. Fair and measured. Grasp that for a Sec. That is all. Bye Felicia.
@tsrobbie @Korosuzo84 Your inability to comprehend general facts makes it impossible for me to continue this conversation. Have a great day chief!
@relaxinallcoo @pmason03 @rkozey This is a huge part of it. Who owns media companies? Entertainment companies. Disney, Time Warner, universal, Sony. Journalism should never be entertainment. It‚Äôs too important for that. The mission is to inform. To educate. The public deserves truth and fact in reporting.
@mitchusson @PerezAA805 I said at the time in August we should be careful the society we scream for. We are all accountable for our own actions. I truly hope no one else is responsible or punished or rewarded falsely for mine. We‚Äôre all adults here.
@relaxinallcoo Sorry for being behind. I‚Äôm trying to answer all I can. Too many convos at once. Lol. Godspeed.
@relaxinallcoo @Scoooter32 @rkozey Zach‚Äôs behavior, whatever it was, needs to be investigated, litigated, adjudicated. Justly. And fairly. Then, and only then, if proven guilty, punishment can be dispensed. Not by media or public. #dukelacrosse
@relaxinallcoo @Scoooter32 @rkozey I don‚Äôt need to educate you on the differences between arrests and charges and ordering stupid things to work and criminal convictions, so I won‚Äôt. If allegations are enough for you, and kinky lifestyle is enough for you, I hope it never turns around towards you.
@manumarquez1986 @shermotothemoon Utah? Bowling Green? Show me the major college football program without ‚Äútroubles‚Äù. Your narrative is falling apart. But forge ahead sailor.
@Kappykidd According to our criminal judicial system, he is. Our civil system said he was guilty. Criminal bar, beyond reasonable doubt. Civil bar, more likely to have committed crime than not. Our criminal justice system is not perfect. Far from it. But it‚Äôs the best the world has known.
@Kappykidd Then charges should have been filed right? But they weren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs on someone. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs on Urban. If it is I would stand corrected.
@tsrobbie @Korosuzo84 Fair and equal justice for all. Regardless of salary, position, color, race, gender, preference. FOR ALL. I have the same standards for you on your salary as I have for Urban on his. Do the right thing. Always. He felt he did. He could‚Äôve done more. The committee &amp; he agreed.
@relaxinallcoo @pmason03 @rkozey This is correct.
@Frankiefingerz8 @rclark333 No.  I‚Äôm being consistent. We have video proof of misdeeds. We don‚Äôt have all of the facts of that night. We need them. The videotape is part of a story. There is another part. Audio would have helped paint that picture. No excuse for violence against women! None!!
@JimmyBozz @isJoeBrownsing In defense of Urban, he is incredibly uncomfortable with his own fame. Actually a private, family man who has never felt at ease in the glare of the spotlight. I understand that on a much smaller scale. Sometimes his unease can be mistaken for aloofness. He is a kind &amp; good man!
@tf0620 What justice that would be. But doubtful.
@mightymac1963 @JKPgh I lived that whole debacle. I was there. Shuddering all along as justice was being handed out on TV. Moral superiority kicks in and it‚Äôs a wrap.  Pause. Breathe. Investigate. All sides. Present what you learn. Let the audience decide. There wasn‚Äôt much of that going on sadly.
@pmason03 @relaxinallcoo @rkozey I miss those days. I hate the media has eroded such credibility. Poll after poll show we are in the teens in public approval. This is a problem. A real problem.  I wish I could help change. The boy who cried wolf is rarely believed. We have done this to ourselves. We must fix it.
@ImReallyTrilly @relaxinallcoo @rkozey It‚Äôs only their job to get a conviction where a crime was committed. If one was, and they couldn‚Äôt expose it, that is a problem.
@relaxinallcoo Thanks! I am a fan of the fair and measured exchange of ideas. I open my mind to be enlightened. We all should. Enjoy your day good sir. Happy Holidays.
@manumarquez1986 @shermotothemoon You shall be afforded no breaks. Just swift and improper condemnation from high atop the mountain.
@JohnnyFactor @JKPgh Ahhh stand corrected. Apologies. lol
@Kruzindirty @NDEaton4 Thanks Charles. Appreciate the chat. Here is my premise. Justice is dispensed by police and prosecutors and juries and judges. Not by media and twitter seeing bits and pieces of the facts. Sit in on half a trial one day. Justice is screaming! But there must be a fair scale.
@relaxinallcoo @Scoooter32 @rkozey That‚Äôs your perception. I‚Äôve never defended Zach. Only Urban‚Äôs accountability and role. It so happens Zach wasn‚Äôt committed of anything. Yet you want his boss to punish him. I hope you don‚Äôt live or work in that world. Zach‚Äôs guilt or innocent has actually never been litigated.
@Kappykidd Was he an alleged abuser? Or convicted abuser? Because a duke lacrosse team was infamously alleged to have done terrible things. And the media and public convicted them of said things. And everyone was wrong. Well, except the lacrosse team.
@DanielJackson11 @rclark333 @tmar8 10 out of 10 twitter trolls agree!
@relaxinallcoo @Scoooter32 @rkozey He was fired. And justly so.
@relaxinallcoo @pmason03 @rkozey He was. The prez piled on. Relationship fractured forever. And thus, my original point.
@relaxinallcoo @pmason03 @rkozey Expectations of people, despite popular misconception, do not change based on salary or position. We are all charged with doing the right thing. There is no sliding scale. That said, his acknowledged misdeeds were addressed. Penalty recommended by investigators. Ignored by prez.
@mulchesoddesy It wouldn‚Äôt shock me. But a wager would go against it.
@PerezAA805 We all are accountable. First for our own actions. Then, to ensure all accused and alleged victims are treated fairly. Anything less is a crime of humanity.
@Kruzindirty @NDEaton4 Funny thing, justice has no eyes to determine any difference between you and anyone else. You SHOULD be compared to any and all. You should hope that‚Äôs the case. And that there is one fair and just way of determining real guilt or innocence.
@Korosuzo84 Well then. An independent investigation without said agenda could‚Äôve made better use of those pesky facts.
@relaxinallcoo @rkozey They recommended a punishment commensurate to the mis-deeds. Public not satisfied. Same public outraged by duke lacrosse allegations mind you, so prez added on.
@bryanpHury Somewhat surprised yes. The TCU win at the time looked impressive. As the season played out. Not as much. The other games....well.
@isJoeBrownsing @JimmyBozz I actually worked with him at ESPN. Got to know him far better than you claim to.
@mightymac1963 @JKPgh Michael, you are a smart man. All I can say is thank God there was no Twitter then. The media and public tried and convicted those men and that coach based on what?! Lies. Pump the brakes. Gather the facts. Let them lead you to justice and pray you get it right. For all involved
@Korosuzo84 That actually, is untrue. But hold tightly to that nugget. It makes you feel better.
@JosephPBryant Bingo! I‚Äôve advocated for that for years! Have a good day.
@bigredshady Thanks Mike.
@Korosuzo84 Oh I read it. And those urban statements are true. I believe he did what he believed was best for everyone. Btw, there are things the commission saw and learned of that the athletic and others didn‚Äôt see. 2 sides. Hear both. Listen carefully. Try to make best and right decision.
@JohnnyFactor @JKPgh Not at all. Just informed. And fair. And wishing that for all who may ever be accused of anything. Or be the boss of someone accused of anything. I‚Äôm all for justice. Fair. And equal. For all!
@tsrobbie @Korosuzo84 Bashing? There you go. Throwing around hyped allegations again. Careful now. Twitter may come at you bro.
@Scoooter32 @relaxinallcoo @rkozey That‚Äôs why you fire a coach.  Well, absent a crime.
@jordanwolfe330 @AndrewBCanan No. A win for twitter mob would have been fired on the spot. He goes out on his terms.
@AndrewBCanan Don‚Äôt kid yourself. This is ALL about the marital issues.
@dooger60 Very perceptive of you. #thinker
@JKPgh Facts. Don‚Äôt let them disrupt your agenda. https://t.co/uj2OruB9mm
@Kruzindirty @NDEaton4 Actually no. Charges don‚Äôt prove a crime was committed, just imply one was committed. I prefer charges before I wreck lives. But that‚Äôs me. Btw, I hope if you‚Äôre ever charged with anything you‚Äôre punished only after it was determined you COMMITTED said crime. That‚Äôs how it works.
@relaxinallcoo @pmason03 @rkozey Journalism is the search for and dissemination of the truth. The truth as it exists. Not as you wish it to be. Never forget that. There‚Äôs not a lot of that going on today. Sadly.
@relaxinallcoo @pmason03 @rkozey You see that‚Äôs a big part of the problem. Too many journalists today believe it is their role to shape public opinion. I know. I was in the world for 30 yrs. Believe it or not many have agendas. It is everywhere. Ashame, because they take away shine from truly gifted journalists.
@rkozey You too friend!!!
@smh122_ https://t.co/uj2OruB9mm hmmmmmm
@IvraII Spot-on my dude!
@perditiondawgs @AndrewBCanan I have expected that yes.
@NDEaton4 @Kruzindirty Stop it!  You‚Äôre being fair and rational and making too damn much sense right now. What do we want??? Justice!!! When do we want it???? Now!!!!
@PerezAA805 It went against what the commission recommended. They investigate. The recommended. The public outcry had to be satisfied. Someone MUST be punished here. So the prez went ahead and fed the mob. Neat. Clean. Done. Maybe not.
@Kruzindirty @NDEaton4 Do we punish judges or juries when the accused they exonerate go on to commit future crimes. I was unaware of that aspect of our judicial system. Ever make a mistake? Think someone was good or innocent and be wrong? If so, hurl that stone.  If not, congratulations on perfection.
@T3rryBowman @devo816 @rclark333 Agreed. But it doesn‚Äôt make it right. That exists for perception. So the league can say see, we care. Their actions tell us otherwise. I‚Äôm unaware of that code of justice for coaches.
@JimmyBozz Have you met him? Do you know him?  I emcee‚Äôd a fundraiser this summer. One he quietly attended. No fanfair. I watched him write a healthy 5 figure check for a terrific cause. No media. No cameras. He did it because he believed in the cause and felt it was the right thing to do.
@GorrellCody Oh. And bye Felicia.
@GorrellCody Can you read? Try this.  https://t.co/uj2OruB9mm shitbag: term used by uninformed member of social justice for all member.
@relaxinallcoo @rkozey (1) https://t.co/uj2OruB9mm that is all.
@rclark333 https://t.co/uj2OruB9mm
@rclark333 It‚Äôs not what I think. Its what those commissioned to investigate the entire matter and look at ALL of the facts think.  That‚Äôs what matters.
@JosephPBryant I want the best teams in. Period. The 8 best. Period.
@mightymac1963 @JKPgh That doesn‚Äôt fit the mobs narrative. Facts be damned. What do we want??? Justice!!! When do we want it??? Now!!!
@AndrewBCanan Oh he knows? He was inside the couples house? Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre the boss, just for a second. And one of your employees has a marital spat. You jumping in to decide blame? Be careful. If so, follow the facts! Where do they lead you. Be careful. The world is watching.
@JosephPBryant Did Phily lose last year to inferior teams? Should they be champs instead of Phily?  No, because you see, in the PLAYOFFS Phily beat all comers. That‚Äôs how it works.
@AndrewBCanan Questionable behavior, investigated. Determinations found. Recommendations made. Then overlooked for the sake of appearances. Oh idk.
@Korosuzo84 What did the commissioned investigation, the one privy to ALL the information and facts recommend? My hope for you: after your trial, a sentencing judge takes to heart the jury‚Äôs findings and recommendation. You know. Real justice. Even if your only role was being the boss.
@rkozey I respect your opinion. But disagree. I hope you are never punished by twitters standards. I hope all the facts are heard in your case. All of them. And then i hope you‚Äôre treated appropriately. Fairly. I also hope any potential victim or alleged victim feels justice too.
@PerezAA805 I hope you‚Äôre never punished because twitter thinks you should be. I hope your justice instead comes from real courts. Real judges. Not the worlds largest bathroom wall.
@JosephPBryant Ahhhh you‚Äôre getting warmer.
@Kruzindirty @NDEaton4 Too much for me to detail here. Way too much.
@ZachMentz The investigation commissioned to study the entire situation, an investigation that was privy to facts you or I never saw, recommended just that.  Those who knew EVERYTHING, recommended time served.
@Sdbuck1 Intentionally. Using the word justice implies it is present.
@rclark333 @tmar8 Allegations. That were looked into. Multiple times. This guy was no saint. But did his transgressions raise to a level of criminal behavior? All investigations say no. Allegations. No doubt. But due process be damned.
@devo816 @rclark333 Fair to you? In any realm??
@JosephPBryant You guys aren‚Äôt one of the top 4 teams in the country? I happen to think you are. OSU is not.
@AndrewBCanan I hope you are never punished in life for rumors. You see we operate in facts. Or at least we should. Investigate rumors where appropriate. This happened. Follow the results and act accordingly.
@AndrewBCanan I hope you never have a boss that caves on you without due process. And if some form of due process happens and the recommendation is time served but you get more, I hope you can find it in you to feel the same way.  I will regret you were treated unfairly.
@relaxinallcoo @rkozey Shown? Proven? Convicted? Or are you now the judge, jury and executioner? We have a system in place for all of that. An imperfect system, but that‚Äôs what we have. Not people with pitchforks.
@BerryJuice83 Thank you!  Very bright man and often right when many can‚Äôt see the truth. #thinker
@JKPgh Better yet imagine a world where justice is dispensed not by law. And order. And courts. But by many nameless, faceless uninformed people writing nonsense on the worlds largest bathroom wall. That‚Äôs a great step forward. We‚Äôve been heading that way for sometime.
@nickseip I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs 20-80. He‚Äôll it could be 50-50. It could be 99% medical, 1% disappointment over August. Either way, I believe it played a factor. I do believe the medical is a huge factor just like I believe the relationship changed forever in August.
@manumarquez1986 No. It was probably the lack of charges or a conviction. Here‚Äôs my hope for you, that a boss never fires you without due process playing out. It‚Äôs mybhope for everyone.
@ZachMentz Not at all. Haters always hate.  It‚Äôs what they do. It was the universities response to it that defined the end.
@JW_Mediagroup What a run though!!
@rclark333 Like the lack of charges. Or conviction? Yea. Good point.
@NDEaton4 @Kruzindirty Facts?! Don‚Äôt let something so trivial get in the way of a juicy story on a bathroom wall.
@MikeC_WSU Yea!  Like a real dance competition. I think you‚Äôre pretty. And you. And you. There! We fixed it. Lol.
@rkozey Toe that PC line. If you‚Äôre ever a boss I would recommend not firing an employee for alleged activities. Courts tend to frown on that. Let due process play out. Which means allegations turn to charges which turn to convictions. None of that happened here.
The Urban resignation surprises me not at all. You could see on his face and sense in his body language he was done with the Buckeyes when Prez Drake caved to the social warrior twitter mob in August.  Can‚Äôt blame him. Hell of a run. 7-0 vs TTUN. Good luck coach Day.
@JosephPBryant Ask Georgia fans what they think.
@JosephPBryant You EARN playoff spots. They are not chosen by computers or juries. Define a system, earn the berth, and PLAY IT OUT. NFL playoff system controversial? NBA? NHL?  MLB? Can‚Äôt remember the last time any of those leagues had a playoff controversy. You get one in NCAA FB every yr.
@HammanTerry Omg. Epic. America couldn‚Äôt handle him though...or could we??? He‚Äôs like cough syrup. Tastes sour going down, but it‚Äôs what we need.
@JGarst_CLE @hisbarber Thanks Jason. Note I only get snarky when snark hits me. And hopefully everyone always known it‚Äôs meant in a fun and good spirited way, unless and until they take it off course. Then, look the hell out. Lol
@techczarcle Massive league.
@JGarst_CLE @hisbarber Touch√©. Excused. For the spelling only.
@badguy974 @JRAMTHAGOAT24 Try 8. But what‚Äôs an exaggeration of 4992, or 244? Mensa man.
@IAmTheStorm7137 While the players get.....
@BaxOn_BaxOff TV is a huge barrier. Huge. Flawed logic.
@LuckySwantucky @izzyrz @JLaurinaitis55 Win your conference, you get the bid.
@JGarst_CLE Oh now you can read my mind. Learn to spell Purdue first, then you can move on to mind-reading.
@AlexMorse1 I‚Äôd be petrified.
@badguy974 @JRAMTHAGOAT24 Yea 5000. Who‚Äôs the idiot?
@mrwayne623 Needs just one more week. And the answer to that is simple. DONT TAKE A MONTH OFF BEFORE THE BIGGEST GAMES OF THE YEAR!!!
@EEGREEN80 You poor flawed soul. Love was clearly scarce in your childhood. I won‚Äôt punish you for that. I don‚Äôt care who gets in. If a jury decides, it is flawed. Tell me Mensa man, which other league uses this brilliant system you hold so dear. I‚Äôll leave you to ponder that thought.
@ejaya2 No. 8.
@DMOSTMAN @NCAAFootball They‚Äôre so slow to change. Afraid to slay the golden goose. A true playoff system would generate more than twice the money. As for the bowls. Ooooo I‚Äôd hate to lose that all important and historical tax slayer bowl. What WOULD we do?!?
@izzyrz @JLaurinaitis55 8. Period.
@clevetalkin You sir, are a genius!
@lukeghiardi That would easily qualify you for the rock head bin. Easily!!! I can no longer see your comments for fear of losing IQ points. Buh-bye Felicia.
This man is a genius amongst rock heads. His sarcasm drives home how truly stupid and ineffective this ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is. Again, do you want your playoff teams decided by a flawed jury, or a defined criteria system? All sports leagues in the world get it right, except one. https://t.co/76LihII4Rn
@Tristan2swole Oh I only do it for self-entertainment!  They never let me down.
@AyZiggity @liveblue32 Lol. He reached my low expectations.

@TimTheDad @Jimmy11241 Lol
@crawfordbounce @Jackson64322163 Lol
@TimTheDad @Jimmy11241 Exactly. In the nfl all 32 teams know before the season what they need to do to make the playoffs. They also know there is a path for ALL OF THEM. Flawed system. Really laughable.
@JosephPBryant @Nehmer4Life You‚Äôre missing thre point because you‚Äôre seeing what you chose to see. The committee can NEVER get it right. Ever. Because a pre-determined playoff criteria is the only just and fair way. Period!!! Until they have that, these are all mythical champions. All of them.
@RevSFranklin That was flawed too.
@PAManAL I‚Äôve been saying that for 12 years.
@Mistah_Vaughn @Nehmer4Life I‚Äôve been complaining about the system for 3 decades. It‚Äôs awful. Start any sports league right now and try using that system. Good luck.
@liveblue32 Learn the facts. You fire an employee with NO CHARGES you lose that lawsuit every time. You are disqualified. Ba-bye.
@Josh_Baum77 Well they‚Äôre out. They had a loss.
@Josh_Baum77 Who‚Äôs you‚Äôre team?
@TMoe56 @JakeGlomb Lol. That dude was seriously impaired. TWI. Tweeting while impaired.
@Josh_Baum77 You an NFL fan?
@JakeGlomb You‚Äôre a simpleton so, you‚Äôre disqualified.
@Nehmer4Life Not at all. Jury picking playoff teams is my beef. Only sports league on planet where that happens. But everyone else is doing unfairly. MUST have pre-determined criteria for playoff format. That way ALL teams know there‚Äôs a path. Simpletons can‚Äôt that. Your excused.
@JakeGlomb Conveniently forgetting the yr EVERYONE said the same thing would happen. OSU didn‚Äôt belong! In as 4. Punked Alabama. Punked Oregon. Lost to va tech at home. So teams can‚Äôt have a bad week. Eliminates everyone in the nfl from making the playoffs. Absurd system. Horribly broken.
@JakeGlomb Northwestern was close?  Hmmmm go check the score chief.
@NOLA9Saints @Jimmy11241 Awwww. Someone wasn‚Äôt loved enough as a kid. Please stay away from other children. You‚Äôre a danger.
@jackstrawelf Ohio? You‚Äôre disqualified.
@Jimmy11241 That‚Äôs funny. OSU struggles with Michigan? You‚Äôre disqualified.
ATTN: All sports leagues except NCAA FB. The time has come to change your outdated and unfair formats. No more pre-determined criteria for making playoffs. Unfair! Let a jury decide. Also STOP paying players. Use barter system &amp; keep billions for yourself. Seems just and fair.
@Randy23462944 Asshat.
@buckeyefansonly @EddieGeorge2727 Going tomorrow night. Looking forward to it.
@Kris1980 Should. But won‚Äôt.

@StephanieARuiz Thanks! But I already purchased.
@johnatamanec @BauerOutage @drivelinebases Lol. You caught that.
@_mythile You watched a different game than I did. Total domination in 1st half. Only second half score was set up by a turnover and very short field. Offense went way too conservative. This game was very much in question in the 4th q.
@DogFent Athletes use any slight, perceived or real, to maintain that chip. No one better at that than Michael Jordan. I‚Äôm fine with him using whatever he need to as motivation. I also see why Hue took the gig. No fault. No foul.

As Bill Parcells once said, you are what your record says you are. A culture change was long overdue. Salvage 2018 by winning more games in the second half than the first, then rebuild that O-line and let John work his draft magic. Today is a new day. Let‚Äôs hope for new results.
@boyjesus0 I‚Äôm going with my judgement on this one sorry.

@TomHorsman @voltzgj @AndyOuriel @sandusky2018 @sanduskyregistr Serving victory 7 days a week! Lol
@believeland19 This one isn‚Äôt really TVs fault. Pitchers need to have pitches between inning to get loose. The game was close and hard fought. Just takes time. They essentially played 2 games at 3 hrs and 40 mins each. Wow!!!

@shakthedoc @mattbrown75 @MDiezel @SportsCenter @KingJames @espn Just truthful.
@BennyNtheJetson @SportsCenter @KingJames Thanks!  Great here. Espn needs a fire-o-meter. I know fire when I see it. It‚Äôs always served with a side of W.
@GeeJayMaui @MDiezel @SportsCenter @KingJames Hell nah. It was time for him to move along. Way too much drama and only 1 title. We good.
@Luckylefty116 @SportsCenter @KingJames Nope. Small market vs big. Watch them ride it now.

@MrEdawg L doesn‚Äôt equal fire. Never.
@P_Townnn @SportsCenter @KingJames No hate towards lebron. None. Grateful. You can‚Äôt call that debut fire. Ask lebron if he thought it was fire.
@P_Townnn @SportsCenter @KingJames Fire=defeat. Nah
@negrito81 @SportsCenter @KingJames Not at all. Fire in defeat?? Ok
@lbcarlin @SportsCenter @KingJames No hate. Truth. Never seen a ‚ÄúFire‚Äù‚Äôdebut that in less the L. We should have higher standards.
@MDiezel @SportsCenter @KingJames Setting wrong agenda for sure. Not new.
@qlc_1983 @RevSum @SportsCenter @KingJames Pleased they did. It was more than time to go.
@yamborma @SportsCenter @KingJames Zactly
@qlc_1983 @RevSum @SportsCenter @KingJames q gets it.
@rubenp24_ No salt at all. For a debut to be ‚ÄúFire‚Äù it better include the dub that‚Äôs all.
@MDiezel @SportsCenter @KingJames Very good Portland team!!! And they‚Äôre not even in the top 2 in the West. #STACKED
@2Hammer5 @SportsCenter @KingJames Nope. Not at all. Just stating the facts.
@BackPackJones @SportsCenter @KingJames Not at all. Just stating the facts. You‚Äôll have plenty of showtime. But he‚Äôs measured in rings. Good luck.

@GenoPowell I‚Äôm in. Lol
@TheDavefrom @davidtjustice Guys stop fighting. We‚Äôre done because our starters, relievers, defense and hitting were all over-powered.  There is not one deficient area. It‚Äôs all lacking to win a World Series.
@JEhrbar_95 That may be the point. Who showed up?
It‚Äôs October 8th and all of CLE‚Äôs sports hope is riding on the Browns. Feels very different, and somehow I‚Äôm ok with this.
@DBK1957 Enjoy.
@jgoose514 Thanks John.
@islandoldman Looks about right.
At least there is no doubt. Tribe definitely lost to a much better team. Astros played to their level, starters, relievers, defense, hitting, and especially clutch hitting all played better.  They‚Äôll be a very tough out. They all understand how to be their best in biggest spots.

If you‚Äôre only as strong as your weakest link....
@anthonyburke @NFL Sad Tony. Sad. But we get the dub.
@BrownsDawgD @kevinthedog_og @DeanBricker1 @NFL Call obvious intentional ground calls and obvious PI calls in CRITICAL situations.

@DeuceDynamite @923TheFan The question wasn‚Äôt is this a must win for hue. It was, is tonight a must win for the browns!  Come on people!!! It‚Äôs week 3. Last years 0-16 does not count against us in the standings.
@x_jingle @923TheFan So if they lose the seasons over? Because that‚Äôs a must win. And if you say it is for you and they rip off 6 of 8 to sit at 6-4-1 you‚Äôll still be done. Come on. #drama
@Jeffdraeger34 @923TheFan You‚Äôre getting warmer.
@ShaneVIII @923TheFan When everything is called a must-win it takes away from the actual and real must-wins. This is a definable term. Must! Or eliminated. Not arbitrary. So, read your own meme. And act accordingly.
@highlifejoe54 @923TheFan Best reply yet!!
@923TheFan Some are having a hard time with the phrase ‚Äúmust-win‚Äù. It is very literal. No gray area. No room for interpretation. Must means must. It means a loss leads to elimination from something. A loss tonight eliminates the Browns from nothing. Thus, it is not a must-win.  ‚Äúshould-win‚Äù
@CLE2018 @923TheFan No losers mentality here. The question was simple: Is tonight a must win? The answer is also simple. No. It eliminates them from NOTHING! This, itbis not a must win. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúreally like to get a win‚Äù ‚Äúreally should win‚Äù but not a MUST!
Watch this and don‚Äôt smile. I dare you!! https://t.co/jgpbMpLFpW
@Aarhead_ @RealSkipBayless @woodypaige @danajacobson I remember you as well. He‚Äôs gifted for sure but works very hard at his craft. If the stars align!!!!2020
@TheeOSU90s @Browns Of course they did. Look at the offense they run. Everything is predicated on quick throws. Defenses understand that. Can rush 4 and get away with it. How‚Äôs that run game look to you? That‚Äôs all a product of.... the o-line. They need to be better. And trust me, they know it.
@Aarhead_ @RealSkipBayless @woodypaige @danajacobson Ah very cool!!! I‚Äôm sure Corey remembers you. Great sport!
@JBfromCLE Must is very easy to define. We must have food, oxygen and water to survive. In sports terms, you must win to keep hope alive. We‚Äôre the browns. We‚Äôve had our hopes and spirits crushed many times, but we keep coming back...because we‚Äôre Browns fans!  We will survive.
@qlc_1983 They have a chance!
@Aarhead_ @RealSkipBayless @woodypaige @danajacobson Thanks Aye! What was your event in track?
Old school. Best school. https://t.co/fWQG0ll4nG

@Slipster11 One more year left on my non-compete contract with the 4 letter network.
@AndyDigeronimo @TheMilkMan08 Hey it happens. They‚Äôre hard to tell apart this year. Lol.
@TheMilkMan08 @AndyDigeronimo Sometimes you just go with it. Lol
@AndyDigeronimo It doesn‚Äôt help.
@rickycampo Lol
Too many walk off losses for the Indians this year. 10
@ShaunLeeper11 @joycalhio Of course they will. And the options are bleak. But you don‚Äôt need to announce what you‚Äôre going to do. There‚Äôs no sense to that whatsoever. It is what it is. And it ain‚Äôt good.
@ShaunLeeper11 @joycalhio Hue knows. The Steelers don‚Äôt.
@joycalhio If it‚Äôs 1 percent that could be the advantage you need. Difference between winning and losing is often measured in inches.
@BretHoovler Nope. Don‚Äôt have him.
Pssst. Atl? You lose faith in 11? I would‚Äôve thrown to him on all 4 downs. It‚Äôs been a long off season for Julio.
@Hoard11 Lifetime roster spot.
@Dawgzfan @WillLarrick @MLBastian @terrypluto @Indians @ZackMeisel @BauerOutage Remember, it‚Äôs not important where he is in sept. It‚Äôs October I‚Äôm worried about.

@Maverick__Matt @brabt59 @timcouchtv @DustinFox37 @Browns I have one more meal for the troll. If by fired you mean paid for 2 1/2 yrs to vacay! You nailed it. I hope everyone gets fired like that. What channel are you on? Where can I catch your play by play? Nice bio MAVERICK!! You Top Gun now? Back to your hole. My work here is done.
@Maverick__Matt @timcouchtv @DustinFox37 @Browns Yeah. You should. You just used a meme to do what you can‚Äôt. You gravitated to the followers. I got a kick out of you hitting send on 22k tweets to your ‚Äúbase‚Äù. Just text them. You jump onto my TL to throw shade, you‚Äôre catching some. Now carry on slappy.
@brabt59 @Maverick__Matt @timcouchtv @DustinFox37 @Browns I know his kind. Constant tweeter. 22k nuggets of knowledge to no one. You know him. Mr. knowsitall. Popular at parties. Plenty of friends.  Lots of free time. And an opinion on everything he believes must be shared. Out of his way to @ people for the attention.
@Maverick__Matt @timcouchtv @DustinFox37 @Browns Matt, you should cut your losses. You really should.
@joe_neall @Maverick__Matt @timcouchtv @DustinFox37 @Browns In my day.
@Maverick__Matt @timcouchtv @DustinFox37 @Browns As long as we‚Äôre going out of our way to @ people, this tweeting thing...it‚Äôs not your thing.  Just saying. Throw hands, catch hands. Tim and Dustin and I, we‚Äôll be fine. https://t.co/E3IWLld8Oq

@x2skier And so do I. He‚Äôll fix this.
@BretHoovler They‚Äôve lost 3 in a row after being red hot. It‚Äôs not even about that right now. It‚Äôs about being a month out from the playoffs.
@AllanPatchin I‚Äôd use him to eat innings to see what he has. For now.
@AllanPatchin This isn‚Äôt 2016. Best for the role right now. That‚Äôs easy.
@AllanPatchin No.
@AllanPatchin Perfect example of stats not telling the whole story. Use your eyes. Who‚Äôs better?
@Tribe5886 @Indians Terry‚Äôs a loyal manager.

@MJudahBrave @SportsNation @FirstTake @woodypaige @danajacobson @RealSkipBayless Lol.
@KenKnoxPhD Thanks Ken. And I agree. Must score off turnovers. Remember, 2 very good receivers were out last night. Keep the faith!
@KenKnoxPhD 5 more than the defending super bowl champs. Means nothing. But it‚Äôs better than 5 pts less.
@KenKnoxPhD @Browns And a dub. Defense wins.

@Cam_From_Canada All very true. And all of that is part 1. The only thing that matters is what is done with all of the capital. Time will tell that truth. So far, and it is very early, it looks like it‚Äôs coming together.
@BIGPLAYdaveymac @KenCarman @Reflog_18 You have a future as a graphic artist!  Slick look!
@Cam_From_Canada The org has had opportunities before but missed out on the one key element. Using the draft currency to get enough difference makers in the building.  Time will tell if this roster will work, but all signs point to major improvement.
@Cam_From_Canada @timcouchtv @Browns @BernieKosarQB @NathanZegura @BGSUGibbs That‚Äôs one narrative.

@johnatamanec @jadande @clevelanddotcom Of the 3 I‚Äôve discussed the topic with 2 felt it is a tribute and the other has no issue either way. All 3 understood it was never intended to do anything but honor. It‚Äôs a cartoon logo. Like many in sports.
@xbucki Thank goodness we have plenty that can make contact or the game would completely go away.
@Ohio_State_Grad @clevelanddotcom As I said, off my lawn chief. You have NO idea what you‚Äôre talking about when you make claims or guesses on my opinion. You‚Äôre dangerous to yourself. Peace!
@Ohio_State_Grad @clevelanddotcom Stay off my timeline with your mindless accusations and conclusions.

My unsupported theory/guess on last nights AS game. W/ AL up 2-1 in B7, the regular baseballs were replaced with the HR derby juiced up balls to spice things up. After 3 runs total thru 6 1/2 innings the teams combined for 11 runs on 7 HR‚Äôs over final 3 1/2. Just a fun guess!

@pwash86 We had a special chemistry for sure. In tv familiarity wins. It has always been that way. You can‚Äôt change personalities like underwear. The audience needs time to form attachment to cast.  It‚Äôs about finding good teams and letting them breathe. Too much change causes chaos.

@Busterlouie1 @ScottyPicciano Nope. That happened when they called KD from the parking lot after that 2016 L.
@MrIDONTSAVEEM Salt free and loving life. My moods don‚Äôt hinge on other grown ass men dribbling a basketball.

@felixbleno Good!  Gotta keep ‚Äò em guessing.
@SigiIIo Hit me after 11 all-star seasons with the Lakers. See ya in  2030. Slappy.
@SigiIIo No salt. Like it or not, the L-train can‚Äôt run forever. Deal with this fact slappy, his best years were spent in CLE. That‚Äôs a #fact
@2scubasteve7 @mattbb2009 No answers. Players wanted this nba. Now it‚Äôs their mess.
@JonAlbertson Without a doubt. But he could‚Äôve extinguished much of it. Let it burn. When he came back with the yearly options he came back to date not to marry. Put Dan on a year to year basis. That was always bullshit. Made landing players more difficult.
@tikeycole Always have always will.
@bobbo405 @danajacobson Thanks my man. Coach is good peeps.
@chase__thomas Followed you. Slide into the dms
@blue4ever1914TW He always supplied plenty of it. Won‚Äôt miss it. Truth.
@pjmileta I will ALWAYS cheer for the name on the front of the jersey over the name in the back. Every time. Loyalty in probaports has never existed. Either way. Player to team or team to player.
@M2Chalet He‚Äôs not long for this world.
@JonAlbertson Why I said thanks. Sour not at all. Taste of the championship still fresh in my mouth.
@ryantc213 @WATSOBR It‚Äôs an epidemic.
@SzzzJake @eclipse811 Hit me next June
@voiceofFNF Absolutely.
@Supreme_takes Grown men. Plenty of blame to go around. Blame game is for people dwelling in the past. No time for that.
@SzzzJake Thankfully!
@paulra78 @Mizdaddyflex Key word. Clowns. They give Twitter a bad name. I have other names for them but you know....
@clevepride140 @Brett_Rentsch Hell yes! Cleveland til I die. And proud of it!
@ThatCroatianKid They set ‚Äòem up.  I knock ‚Äòem down.
@king_jefe63 Cheap? Check his payroll. Call himnother things. Cheap ain‚Äôt one of them.
@DonnieHoward2 @Mizdaddyflex Thanks Donnie!  Those were good times.
@Gaaangs @PopcornSutton09 Truth be told it‚Äôs always been broken. How many nba teams have never won a title??  It‚Äôs a joke. Has been forever.
@DavidRusso_NYM @CoreoNews Hey David. Go re-read my tweet. First word was thanks. But you missed that.  But I expect that from a Mensa member like yourself.  Google it pal. Out.
@Mizdaddyflex This made me laugh.  You guys never let me down.
@IAmMikeEdwards The Cavs season will end next year the same way it has every year but one over the last 50. Without a title. Btw they weren‚Äôt winning one had he stayed the next 5.
@Bucknate1532 Why would the lakers do that? They knew they had him. Trust me! This wasn‚Äôt just decided. Happened when they fired the gm w/o his input. He saved his new team 50 mill. All‚Äôs fair in love and war.
@itallionstalian And then the game ends. And no rings for fans. Or checks. Or parades. Just the fantastic memory of a great night!!!
@MichaelYan23 @Mizdaddyflex I smack their hands.
@Jogull4 Just sitting by the fire with fam loving my life.
@king_jefe63 For real, none. Just wine. The good life. Whether my teams win or not. I decide my happiness. Not other grown man dribbling or hitting or throwing a ball. I keep sports in perspective. It‚Äôs the only way.
@akrongt09 Save a ridiculous block by lebron itsb4 straight for the dubs. That‚Äôs unreal in today‚Äôs free agent world. They aren‚Äôt finished yet.
@jjeffcooley Don‚Äôt feel for me. Or any of us. We experienced our title. It was cool and all. But no fan received a bonus. Or a ring. Or a parade. It was a thrill in the moment. It‚Äôs ours forever. And it‚Äôs over. No one dies because he‚Äôs leaving. Life goes on. I wish you luck with him.
@JPNugghead Here‚Äôs the thing slappy, you can‚Äôt tell me what I meant or how I feel. Now keep the train moving and troll in another neighborhood  you‚Äôre kind aren‚Äôt welcome here.
@WATSOBR Thanks Brent!
@The_Real_ChrisL @PhotoCLE And had a 4 leaf clover and a buckeye in every players shoe. Scandal.
@KCarter92474 I‚Äôll make a deal with you. You do you. I‚Äôll do me. And we‚Äôll stay out of each other‚Äôs way. Now carry on.
@ubersamoyed I‚Äôd play for any team that would take me. I‚Äôm 52 with a weak left hand.
@Skilz007 @Brett_Rentsch He deserved that.
@JPNugghead Ah. Then it‚Äôs a reading comprehension thing. No glasses for that. You‚Äôre stuck then, boss.
@WATSOBR Just my last attempt at humor of the night. Lol. Peace my man.
@Mizdaddyflex My free agency doesn‚Äôt begin for another year. After my free money stops. But I‚Äôll keep you posted chief.
@itallionstalian No.  It isn‚Äôt. Maybe for some. Not for me. My happiness does not depend on the success or failure of other grown men. Temporary thrills. That‚Äôs all. No rings. No checks. Just entertainment in 2 hour blocks.
@WATSOBR It‚Äôs all good Trent. I love the back and forth!
@lando_cuyahoga @10centBeerNite Thanks Lando.
@JPNugghead You missed the first word of my tweet. You need glasses chief?
@twm825 @JGbuckeye @Uncle_Tom_Hicks Nope. Kyrie already hit that checkmate button.
@akrongt09 All is well! Thanks. Hope it is in your world. But close?  You watch the 2nd half of games 6 and 7 of wcf? Nothing close about that. And even if refs didn‚Äôt reverse that call and even if Jr knew the score Cavs ain‚Äôt winning that series. Your IF scenario is a major stretch.
@stizzo47 @SHIZZD These dudes make it easy.
@RAZDAJOLLYROGER Hmmmm. I missed the Cavs drama during the heat years.
@The_Real_ChrisL The draft didn‚Äôt do it. Remember 2016. It was when KD got fed up taking those Ls and ran to Oakland. Changed the league for good. and not  for the better.
@MikeTomlinsEgo @ap467429 I‚Äôd have to say you may be right. And damn that‚Äôs saying something!!!
@ahmaha1 All good here. You can have it.
@C_Full19 Soon enough. Browns pre-season games then next fall when my contract runs out.
@WATSOBR Not really. Because CLE is done paying Lebron.
@WATSOBR Nope. Amused. Seriously.
@Brett_Rentsch You‚Äôre right Brett. The land needs more fans like this. https://t.co/EvsAxrnVV7
@SHIZZD @stizzo47 I have to sit back for another year and collect that free money bigun. Where can I find you on the dial?
@RAZDAJOLLYROGER News flash. He could‚Äôve stayed, and Cavs weren‚Äôt winning one regardless.
@ubersamoyed Never rooted for the heat. You‚Äôve got it confused.
@nFamousOneuhB Thanks Nate. Peace.
@Venenott Finally!  Lol.
@TheRealTeamBoey @SHIZZD Candy from a baby
@boilerfansc I‚Äôll take GS all-stars.
@DavidRusso_NYM @CoreoNews Salty about that title?!Salty about the thousands of highlights?  How?  I‚Äôve realized since KD went hunting rings in Oakland it was over for every other team for the near future. My time here is limited and valuable. Too valuable to waste on wishes pegged to other grown men.
@TylerEPalisin9 @ScottyPicciano That‚Äôs fair.
@stizzo47 @SHIZZD Always do. lol
@nFamousOneuhB Oh I can touch on it. There are plans. I‚Äôm good on the names though. Thanks.
@10centBeerNite Lol. I‚Äôll do anything to be liked. Anything. Just please pay attention to me and like me. I‚Äôll let you treat me anyway you want. Just please like me. Stop it! You look foolish already.
@rogerdan39 Perfect place for it too!
@SzzzJake Lol. You probably thought at halftime of games 6 and 7 that the rockets had em. Sucker!
@ubersamoyed I missed when the Cavs had the super team.
@JoeBucki18 @ScottyPicciano Who said it was ok?
@ap467429 Wow. The race card. Hmmmmmm. Interesting.
@timtraut But GS All-stars will stand in the way.
@kevinob53 Don‚Äôt read it that way. When changes were made in the front office  without his input he was done.
@Venenott Hmmm. He didn‚Äôt play game 7?  I missed that part salty.
@eclipse811 Everyone but golden state is in re-building mode. All lack pieces. Houston was a lebron away.
@TannerDudley And it‚Äôs never been any worse.
@nFamousOneuhB Can‚Äôt until I‚Äôm done collecting my free money from Espn. Life‚Äôs a bitch chief. For some of us anyhow.
@SHIZZD Who‚Äôs mad?  And you meant to use ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù. But I‚Äôm sure you knew that based on your reading comprehension skills chief.
@jeremyfhj @crawfordbounce lol. All good this time around. Title achieved. He wasn‚Äôt getting another in cleveland, so I get it all. He‚Äôll still be looking up at golden state next year only he‚Äôll have a longer off season.
@JoeSmithson19 Doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs. 4 team league most years. 2 team league now.
@ohiostmusicman @DaveMurphy0121 Who said it was?  You missed the nothing changes part.
@Venenott Calling KD from the parking lot after that L. Work.
@MichaelKarvelis Thanks mike!
@scottjo58377928 @j4ohio Scott Scott scott. So much wrong with this. But thanks for the chuckle.
@herzonestrada82 I always do!!
@nFamousOneuhB @Musicand5liters @TheBigHoss62 Don‚Äôt try. Some people have twisted sense of reality. See and hear what they want. I‚Äôm amused by it actually.
@omare2101 You must‚Äôve missed the thank you part. I understand. Reading can be tough.
@Iam_Sportcenter Not at all. I never let probaports detract from life. No rings. No paychecks. Just temporary thrills. When the last whistle sounds, the entertainment is over.
@JoeSmithson19 Problematic from jump. But the land got the title. Allll good!!!
@hbryant42 Lol.
@DaveMurphy0121 The nba finals will be played 2 weeks earlier next year. They‚Äôll be called the western conference finals.
@yruscreaminj Would‚Äôve been fun to watch! And at least brought back some interest.
@CC_Rider32 That certainly didn‚Äôt help.
@TheBigHoss62 @Ohio_State_Grad @nFamousOneuhB @Musicand5liters No. You have serious comprehension issues. Some people see what they want to see.
@AeroNutTom Thanks Tom. It‚Äôs not hard
@MarkMheston Hollywood baby.
@Musicand5liters @TheBigHoss62 @nFamousOneuhB Lebron brought unprecedented skill set. Greatest player EVER! Period. He also brings un-necessary drama. Comes with the suit.
@JayHeatTheKilla @ScottyPicciano Never been less.
Unless Lebron went to Hou nothing changes &amp; none of it matters. The Golden State All-Stars will still win the title. Cavs weren‚Äôt winning it w/  him &amp; they certainly won‚Äôt w/out. NBA‚Äôs competitive balance is still broken.  I wish Lebron the best in LA &amp; will always  be thankful!
@nFamousOneuhB @Musicand5liters @TheBigHoss62 Winner!!
@Ant_Cirillo No sour here. I wish him all the best and thank him forever for the title. Cle can not win a championship just as easily next year. Golden state all-stars have the trophy on lock. Enjoy that.
@ScottyPicciano Not mad at all. Just way over the nba. Golden state all-stars ruined the league for me. No comp. No interest.
@bbiscewl Me. https://t.co/VHfvJ3psBH
@JayHeatTheKilla No years here. Got that title. No more coming with the golden state all-stars.
@Glenn_247 Not one slice. Washed away the nba after game 1.
@fredward1129 Matters not at all in my life. Didn‚Äôt watch one second of finals after game one call reversal. Whacked league.
@CoreoNews All sugar here!! Washed the nba from life after game 1 call reversal.
Thanks for the title. Please take the drama with you. https://t.co/1QWtzKLgSB
@Jeremy_George Call ‚Äòme as I see ‚Äòem. I just wasted 2 hours watching one team pass the ball over 11 hundred times.   IN ONE MATCH!!!!

@criswilson02 4th. And no. This is the worlds biggest tournament. You don‚Äôt decide on penalties.
@luharsehgal @PeteJolicoeur @RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith We disagree. That‚Äôs ok. Thanks man.
@DanCanova We have a winner!!!!
@cthehunter I did. Catch up.
@luharsehgal @PeteJolicoeur For simple minds there may be no better way. For progressive thinkers, there is always a better way.
@luharsehgal @PeteJolicoeur We‚Äôre four teams tied? Come on man?!  This isn‚Äôt rocket science.
@luharsehgal @PeteJolicoeur No. That would be single elimination. The nba playoffs is a tournament. Not single elimination. A tournament. Playoffs.
@PeteJolicoeur You think the stadium would be empty???
@JohnnyOhio Better than fair play!! And I‚Äôd watch!
@luharsehgal @PeteJolicoeur That was your suggestion not mine. I‚Äôm laughing at you not with you.
@PeteJolicoeur Yes. Couldn‚Äôt happen that way.
@luharsehgal @PeteJolicoeur The tournament is the playoff stage. Qualifying is qualifying. Not that hard. Group stage is part of the tournament. Playoffs.
@omieg89 Lol. All good.
@Be_Led_ Lol. Agreed.
@omieg89 God NO!!!! We have that already. It‚Äôs called college football.
@PeteJolicoeur Forget everything you know for a second. Just imagine a scenario where tomorrow japan and Senegal re-convened for a pk round. Would you watch? The entire world would. Logistics? Sure. But very doable. The entire sports world would watch.
@alex_s_thomas @philosophiezy I‚Äôd say the worst part of the game.
@ChaddyDaddy_19 @VEGALLIANCE No.
@PeteJolicoeur Wrong. Qualifying is the play-in stage. The tournament is being played in Russia. You know this.
@PeteJolicoeur Judging by the number of cards that weren‚Äôt deserved and plays with fouls that weren‚Äôt called, you‚Äôre no more in charge of that than a coin flip.
@ChaddyDaddy_19 @VEGALLIANCE Anything but penalties.
@alex_s_thomas We have a winner!!!
@PeteJolicoeur No. The World Cup IS the playoff. The NFL‚Äôs playoff format is simple. You play until a winner is decided.
@CJCRams This is just one of many things most Americans don‚Äôt get about the game. A real shame. But reality.
@alex_s_thomas My criticism Alex is meant in a constructive way. This is clearly the worlds game. This event takes 4 years to roll around again. Just seems way to arbitrary. The refs literally decide things this way.
@PeteJolicoeur You‚Äôre taking it apples to oranges. We‚Äôre talking about a playoff game not the play-in stage. This tournament is 4 years in the making. Cards?? And I don‚Äôt have a dog in the fight. I also know I would not want to advance that way.
@SuperJamono Agreed. But it‚Äôs not an option if the teams in question play head to head earlier in the tournament.
@mgbode_WFNY @BFoley82 Still not great,  but it doesn‚Äôt send either team home.
@BFoley82 I‚Äôd prefer practically anything over this. I‚Äôve seen literally a dozen cards that weren‚Äôt. Same for plays that included penalties with no calls. And THAT‚ÄôS how we‚Äôre deciding it? Let the brilliant minds that run the sport figure it out.
Wow. Deciding who advances in a tournament based on ‚Äúfair play‚Äù? I‚Äôm all for fair play, but imagine if the NFL decided a playoff game passed on fewest penalties?  There has to be a better way.
Go get it!! https://t.co/6Uex1Tcb4C

@tdudz5 @bsakes He did what he does. He‚Äôs true to his style. I admire him for that. Just because it‚Äôs not my style doesn‚Äôt make it wrong.
@michellebrains Football seems to be the  most important thing in Baker‚Äôs life.   I‚Äôm not sure Johnny could say that at anytime while he was in the NFL.
@bsakes That said, I respect and like Colin a great deal. He has a job and I do not. So it‚Äôs not for me to criticize. He has takes. Strong takes. Not easy to do. But he stays true to his and unlike some can admit when he makes a mistake. One of the best in the business.
@MarkMheston The answers on the one td celebration vs OSU and his response to the police video.
@bsakes Not my style. Unfair misrepresentation. Showing one piece of a puzzle and pretending to see the whole picture. Each piece has value based on all of the others but tells no story. Together you have an image.
@MarkMheston You were listening to the wrong part.
@songgirl127 Understood. I was pissed too. But I‚Äôve decided, I‚Äôd rather play with that guy than against him.
@LyinBrian1 Feel free to disagree. One of us will proven wrong. I feel ok with my bet. Kids a proven winner. We‚Äôll see.

@jgoose514 @ClevelandJeff @Indians Sure! Love any seat at a baseball game.
It‚Äôs all coming together. But your math is off. It‚Äôs actually 26 feet 10 inches. https://t.co/MSKPfr0hxT
@ClevelandJeff @jgoose514 @Indians Did either home run leave us down big late? No. They both tied games in the 8th. That in the moment is the thrill. Did they lose both? Yes, but each gave fans a thrill IN THE MOMENT. Your  analogy is broken.
@ClevelandJeff @jgoose514 @Indians And if lebron leaves, he leaves. He left behind a title. The cities only one in my lifetime. I‚Äôm grateful.
@ClevelandJeff @jgoose514 @Indians You‚Äôre missing the point of being a fan. Sports should add to our lives, not detract from them. It‚Äôs meant to be entertainment. When I play, I play to win. Every game.  Every time. As a fan that‚Äôs impossible. You‚Äôre mentality applies to players. You‚Äôre not one. Relax and enjoy.
@MelissaGHughes @crawfordbounce @tallglassofKP @CamElementary Way to give back kid!!!
@ClevelandJeff @jgoose514 @Indians Give it time. You get no check when they win. No ring. No parade. It‚Äôs for entertainment. Enjoyment.
@ClevelandJeff @jgoose514 @Indians Billy bitterman. Chill! It‚Äôs a reg season game.
@alikasams Ahhhh I‚Äôve had 3 of those myself. No fun. Good luck with the rehab!

@Kensizzle @Wpark83 All good. Snarky civil works for me. It beats down right douchey which I loathe.
@Kensizzle If you believe that, then go with that.
@PeteJolicoeur Genius!!!
@MattKeough Well, I‚Äôve never seen George and Brandi in the same room at the same time. This is sadly funny.
@mightymac1963 Sadly both apply.
@JonathanEperson I‚Äôll take filet and baked potato any day of the week so there‚Äôs that. But bdubs wings are my fave of any of the chains. If there‚Äôs a big game on bdubs wins this debate. If not, put me down for 2 at outback. G‚Äôday mate.
@JonathanEperson Any occasion?
@Wpark83 @Kensizzle They are. But I too watched Jordan‚Äôs entire career. He was the best the game had ever seen. WAS. Lebron is the most complete player the game has ever seen &amp; the gap between he and the next best is widening. The eye test always wins out. He does everything you want a player to do.
What?! How is Brandi standing next to this with a smile on her face? The plaque looks like a cross between Rex Ryan and Eleanor Roosevelt. How does this happen?  https://t.co/4LW6gbJXsX
@Wpark83 @Kensizzle Ah got it.
@WillLarrick My mic drop stat for LBJ as GOAT is this: He is the only player EVER to lead all players in a single NBA Finals in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. He did it in defeating the best regular season team of all-time with an epic block late to seal the ring. BOOM! https://t.co/jieZ5FnGz3
@MachiaBilly It was a perfect blend!  I loved it.
@scirner It was special!!
@SportsAholic6 I think it‚Äôs unlikely but you never know. I believe KDs switch to Golden State was his checkmate move in LBJ. He couldn‚Äôt beat him w/out  an army of greats, so he went to GS to finally collect rings, and in the process block lebrons path to clear cut GOAT status.
@Wpark83 @Kensizzle Truth always provides laughter. In this case, he set himself up, then took the bait. It was candy from a baby. Lol
@Kensizzle As for the woods comparison, the kind of training tiger was doing put his first job at risk. Running 10 miles in combat boots? A golfers legs &amp; back are critical to his game. The harm he did by chasing an alternative dream left its mark on his body. Baseball didn‚Äôt do that to MJ.
@Kensizzle No. Neither harsh nor like woods. He abandoned his team at a time when he and they could have made a run for all-time immortality.  He left a 3-time defending champion to play minor league baseball. Lebron left a franchise that couldn‚Äôt give him what he need to win a ring.
@RonWalk49187024 Yes we do!!!
@Kensizzle Well then, your guy quit on his team, to play minor league baseball.
@ramonetyrelle @MCStophe @Jonathan_Dubya Picking poison is not in my positive nature. Lol
@MachiaBilly He did!  Along with William F. Buckley
@RonWalk49187024 Hey Ron! How are you?
@Kensizzle Oh yeah? Who is your GOAT?
Oh, and he‚Äôs 33 years-old. https://t.co/eESehubqZ8
He spoke at my college commencement. His ‚Äúbe kind‚Äù message really resonated.  It almost always makes those around you more comfortable. It ALWAYS makes me more comfortable to be kind.  #ThingsILearnedFromMrRogers https://t.co/OVQCQhcIkd
@ramonetyrelle @MCStophe @Jonathan_Dubya I agree. May not have been the best play by kyrie NO player is winning a title without at least one other and maybe two other super stars. It‚Äôs just where we are today.
@B1GHomie @crawfordbounce Very true.
@B1GHomie @crawfordbounce Any more questions D? Lol
@ramonetyrelle @MCStophe @Jonathan_Dubya You missed the point. The point is this Celtics team is better than the Cavs team when you take away the two superstars.
This!!! Hahahahhaha https://t.co/oCrBsEHnm6
@northNJtrack @crawfordbounce Will do.
@zach_jones44 @88Jmoze He‚Äôs the greatest sharer if the basketball ever.
@ramonetyrelle @MCStophe @Jonathan_Dubya Who has better team? Cavs minus lebron or celts minus kyrie. That‚Äôs easy. If lebron went out in March is CLE still playing?
@northNJtrack @crawfordbounce Meet in calibin2 weeks. USA‚Äôs in Iowa then Europe. Maybe others. Not sure.
@eroc4774 @crawfordbounce Yep.
@ramonetyrelle @MCStophe @Jonathan_Dubya And his numbers....went down.
@88Jmoze They had to be. Way more opportunities. No superstar.

@jayhawk4life35 @hymansays @ChidiAhanotu @sagesteele @NBA Why gambling will be legal.
@hymansays @ChidiAhanotu @sagesteele @NBA Just the truth. Ratings way down. Revenue way down. Not a good outlook.
@ChidiAhanotu @sagesteele Wait till you see the nba finals. Congrats @NBA your product is officially unwatchable. Of potential 28 games in conf semi-final round they needed just 19. Loss of revenue is in 10s of millions. Competition is gone! #snoozeville
@DominicVerdell @cavs Like the Celtics when they get it handed to them by GS.
@jwillett83 It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a race to get dominated by GS.

@Ejayjones3 @RealSkipBayless Yea. He loses so much he‚Äôs been to 8 finals before his 33rd birthday.
@jestes9 @RealSkipBayless Ppg. Assts and efficiency rating all down. Speaks volumes.
@xbucki @RealSkipBayless Flatly wrong.
@at_motion @waidharper @MattFinkes @RealSkipBayless Jibberish. All of it.
@at_motion @RealSkipBayless No one is discrediting mj. 2nd best player ever. It‚Äôs not like he won 13 titles in 13 season. 7 years he never made the finals. When he got there, he and his team closed. He led them there. He just isn‚Äôt as complete a player as lebron is.
@rerthegreat @RealSkipBayless Let‚Äôs face it, on MN the teams Love played on pre LBJ who else was going to gobble up all those stats. EVERYONE that plays with LBJ is in a supporting role. Period. And thanks brother.
@waidharper @MattFinkes @RealSkipBayless Ah, the hate directed at a player who has reached 8 nba finals before he turned 33.
@rerthegreat @RealSkipBayless Yes. He did. #facts thanks for asking. https://t.co/ee11d9ZONb
@jestes9 @RealSkipBayless He left because he was tired of living in LBJ‚Äôs shadow. No one will ever mistake Kyrie as the GOAT. And idk his numbers last year were BETTER! https://t.co/L0Pe7GNsjz
@IslandKing63 @RealSkipBayless That‚Äôs funny.
@MattFinkes @RealSkipBayless Ah how the legend of players grow as they get further and further from the era.
@RealSkipBayless Because Lebron is the greatest passer of the basketball by a non pt guard EVER! He makes everyone around him better! #fact
@psmith7493 Thanks Patrick.
@kevin61934871 @JonRudder You‚Äôre late to the party hoss. It was much worse. That was just the final blow.
@BigPopa1971 Thanks man!
@BigPopa1971 @JonRudder I just tossed a social grenade at your timeline too. Lol.
@BigPopa1971 How‚Äôs this for a downer. The cowboys have won the same number of Super Bowls in the last quarter century as the Browns have. Which is 3 rings fewer than lebron has. And actually the raptors have a less than zero percent chance of winning a title. The Cavs are in the finals 4.
@JonRudder Dude was a moron. Clearly wasn‚Äôt loved enough as a kid. He‚Äôs a KNICKS fan!!!
@SlickJD2 They are until they see the Cavs. #facts
@Bchester79 They owe me. Lol
@greek0034 Funny. 4 teams won 50 games in east. Only 2 teams won 50 west. For that nonsense you‚Äôre permanently banned!
@proud2BfromCLE That‚Äôs the genius of lebron. Just make the playoffs, then make hay!
@realadubbs34 Just stop it.  You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself.

@bengela12 @ljf1017 Wouldve?  No response.
@bengela12 @ljf1017 And look what they‚Äôre doing!  Remember, when Jordan went full on Baseball? the bulls still won more games in each of those two seasons than the Cavs won this year. He had a GREAT team and an all-time great coach! Lebron had same in Miami and won a pair of rings.
@ljf1017 @bengela12 Such a bad way to claim a player is the best ever. Titles won!  Takes a team. And go jo jo!!! Lol
@bengela12 That argument makes my case more than any other. One player can GET a team to a finals. It takes a TEAM to win it. Did Kobe or Jordan reach 9?  And what about then7 season MJ DIDNT make the finals?  I love how his army acts as if he was 13-13. Revisionist history!
@Buckeye_in_Va @crawfordbounce @tommy_sage @Yodisgio @darny3_16 By that flawed logic yes. Lol

@tommy_sage Accepted.

@rizsrug216 @jtsnydr44 I won‚Äôt waste my time. You clearly don‚Äôt get it.
Poor mike clevinger.
@Yodisgio @tommy_sage @darny3_16 Lol. Rings=team stat. Pts, rebs, blocks, steals, assts all individual stats. Each has a skill set completely different. No player ever, before or to come, has or will own all skill sets to lead an nba finals IN ALL 5!! Recognize and stop the hate.
@sturbill @DvonTheGreat Just watch last nights game. Dude was mauled for 42 mins.
@richurbinati How many finals did he play in? What about the other years he never made the finals? Those don‚Äôt count against him?? LBJ s address has been the nba finals. Look at the rosters of some of the teams LBJ took to the finals.
@_thesauce Thanks josh
@cjdew67 Who‚Äôs trying to erase him? No one. LBJ just surpasses him. Records fall with every series.
@PaceTire Smartest thing I‚Äôve read in this debate
@tgriff716 @sturbill What stat line did he lead in? Because lebron led all players both teams in all 5 stats. That‚Äôs too easy.
@Yodisgio @tommy_sage @darny3_16 How does 1 player,  w/ love and kyrie on his team, lead all players, including curry, Thompson, green, in ALL categories in a 7 game finals??? Get your mind around that. Blocks? Check! Steals? Check! Pts, rebs, assts, check, check, check! Case rested #vsgreatestregseasonteamever
@TheInfamousChee @tommy_sage You meant you‚Äôre. Not the only mistake you made though.
@Yodisgio @tommy_sage @darny3_16 Takes team to win rings. so in using that to measure individual greatness, no you‚Äôre wrong. By your measure Karl Malone isn‚Äôt great. #flawedlogic
@sturbill I watched both for entire careers. I must have missed when mj took down a 73 win team in the finals by leading all players for entire series in pts, assts, rebs, steals and blocks. #willneverbedoneagain
@SkrticX @Indians @Cleveland_PL @OTBaseballPhoto @BDbaseball6 @sabr @terrypluto @stomattu @jfeador @MLBastian Wow John!!! I went to photo day that year. So many great memories. The links you sent were terrific!!! Any chance You could find the originals or negatives of any of those pics? So great to see them!!! Thanks so much.
@TheInfamousChee @tommy_sage A block is just as good. His numbers dwarf mjs. Most complete player ever. led all players, both teams, in all  5 stat categories for a 7 game finals against a 73 win team. Only man ever to do it. Will never be done again.
@tommy_sage Eye test. Use it. That you think that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs done proves to me you‚Äôre blind. Out.
@mrmarty_mcfly Jordan was 6 for 15 winning titles. #facts.
@Appleguy32 He was 6 for 19 in titles. If that‚Äôs your yardstick bill Russell slays Jordan. simpleton.
@Appleguy32 That proves one thing. MJ has beetwr teammates. This is ball not boxing. One man never wins a title. Oh, what happened to the other  13 seasons ? By my count he was 6-13.

@bhaynes81 Well, I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm too old. The browns will. Which is what I stand by.
@Be_Led_ Yea. Who needs a guard. Jeez!
@CoryGardner2 Ready to give him his fair shot. Many intangibles that a qb must have to be successful.
@SeanBrawley26 The offense was the key to that turnaround.
Love both of the 2nd Rd picks!!! Chubb, Hyde, Duke, Gordon, Landry and Taylor.  This team will score points!!! #BrownsDraft
@cbyoder1 56
@AyeJefferson @dubby_88 56
@TheeRealMikeP The bulls.
@TheeRealMikeP I am!! Pitched 3 innings last Sunday in a scrimmage.
@I_am_Bmoll @browns5719 Some need to be learnt.
@RollysonJustin I do too. But it‚Äôs been liberating!!
@EdSchiavone Thanks Ed. However, it was late in the season for darnold. Shouldn‚Äôt he have been playing his best? That doesn‚Äôt apply to usc? And was OSU clicking 2 games earlier when a mediocre Iowa team dropped 56 on them?
@phoneguy24 @mjsloan84 Didn‚Äôt darnold have the benefit of playing the whole season too? Shouldn‚Äôt he have been at his best. And to your theory, with Iowa being so late in the yr and the OSU def peaking, how‚Äôd they give up 56???
@steve78powell Wasn‚Äôt it late in the season for darnold too?  Shouldn‚Äôt he have been much better than early in the season? And oh, the Iowa game was late in the season too for OSU. The hawks dropped a 50 spot on OSU. Just a month before they shredded darnold.
@EShimmy20 @EricJ3122 Yea Eric I didn‚Äôt even waste my time on that one.
@browns5719 Same can be said for usc and darnold?  What he didn‚Äôt get better too? If not, is t that a problem?? And was the OSU defense better when Iowa dropped a 50 spot on them??
@EricJ3122 When you name for me one usc qb that won a super bowl.
@GaryDBenz @Tom_RedRight88 And offenses and qbs don‚Äôt?  Stop the madness.
@YeaThatsMe_3 It did for us.
@GENTILEJ1A Tip: never question someone‚Äôs smarts and misuse ‚Ä¢your/you‚Äôre‚Ä¢ in the same sentence.
Not a science! https://t.co/3uHXne5WSP
@YeaThatsMe_3 Iowa dropped  a 50 spot on that OSU defense at the end of the season. Much closer in time to the usc game than the Oklahoma game.
@buckeyes883 He‚Äôs a sophomore. But he‚Äôs on the nfls radar. https://t.co/KB69vlI3V8
@buckeyes883 See Iowa game.
@MostlyTony @RUSKlN No. Both last season.
@YeaThatsMe_3 See Iowa game.
@JNickJay You‚Äôve seen him play how many Nfl games? 1 fewer than I‚Äôm basing MY opinion on. Who‚Äôs the idiot???
@__AB Perfect age!
@Winstar1970 See Iowa.  Hear mic drop.
@BrianDoering80 Like against Iowa?  Together?  Ok.
@Jps027 @Tomboh36 You‚Äôre right about one thing!  You don‚Äôt KNOW. you think.
@believeland6 See Iowa.
@BrianDoering80 Was the Iowa game early or late?
@Tomboh36 @Jps027 Think about it. Logic is easy to follow.
@dubby_88 Not at all. Unlikely. There‚Äôs a difference. A fluke happens once. They scored 8 tds in that defense. 8 is not a fluke. After a while it was very predictable.
@CleFan802 @denzelward That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been told that and I doubt you‚Äôre qualified to make that judgement. So I‚Äôm going with no. No I don‚Äôt have Stockholm syndrome. But thanks for the arm chair analysis. Just as valuable as your football acumen.
@Stuart_Sharrett But you love him. But it‚Äôs sucks. Got it.
@dirtydiapers77 On 45 throws with 3 turnovers a pick six and wait for it...8 sacks.
@MattFinkes Thanks Matt. Come to cle and let‚Äôs play golf. Bring that punk Miller too lol.
@GregOnDemand216 Glad I lived up!!
@dubby_88 Nothing flukey about giving up 50
@jlgrimwood See Iowa game
@bmac1818 @erich_karthan On that I agree.  It‚Äôs just pointless to rip a kid that hasn‚Äôt taken a snap in the nfl. Not a great way to welcome the kid who holds our future in his right hand. None of this is a science. We‚Äôll know in a few years.
@greycole05 @FireRunner Ok play that card. No usc  qb has won a super bowl.
@dave_eichorn So which defense allowed a 50 spot to Iowa??
@stuart_dallas Thanks Stu
@KosichJohn Thanks John!
@LDocks003 When was the Iowa game? That defense was much closer to the one we had in late December.
@shays82cle @dooger60 Thanks my man!
@TrottaJim See the Iowa game?? That was a month before usc. Just sayin.
@dubby_88 When was Iowa?
The smartest thing I‚Äôve read all night!!! https://t.co/Gtg1VmJwAr
@BrownsForum @njkujawa Yea. Sc just can‚Äôt get any players.
@samuelldrew You‚Äôre right on 2 of the 3. I‚Äôm right and smart.
@MattFinkes I refuse to argue with a Buckeye legend! You win   Lol
@Jps027 The game was in December. Go watch the Iowa game again a month earlier. THAT defense had a 50 spot dropped on them by a .500 team.
@criswilson02 Both.
@dooger60 You mean that same dee that gave up 50 plus to Iowa a month earlier. Yea.
@ClayDavis90 Not get sacked 8 times and not turn it over 3 times. Other than that, nothing.
@BrianDoering80 No. It wasn‚Äôt. The same OSU team that lost by a hundred to Iowa a month earlier.
@samuelldrew You already did.
@AlexMorgan_33 See Russell Wilson.
@erich_karthan Better than making a decision...after no games.
@CleFan802 @denzelward What matters is we give these guys a chance and make them feel like they‚Äôre playing for the best fan base in the nfl. This kid is an animal!!!
I know some are hating the mayfield pick but re-watch the Oklahoma-OSU game then the USC-OSU game. same defense, loaded with NFL talent and mayfield ripped them to shreds while Darnold struggled with 8 sacks 3 turnovers and a pick 6.
@denzelward welcome home!!!
@SportsAholic6 Thanks my man!
@chadmc32188 @WEWS Hahahaha. Yea. No land lovers there.
@chadmc32188 @WEWS Why what did they do?
You Cedi coming off the bench?  Who‚Äôs lebron? https://t.co/hFflDnUDaB
@lbcc49er @DJMiddlecup Appreciate it
@SportsAholic6 And I need just one stat to prove it. 1 player has led all players in all 5 stats for an entire NBA Finals: Lebron v the greatest regular season team ever: GSW. https://t.co/dJvDZv70oA
@SportsAholic6 Give Jordan some these rosters. Laughable. A nba title is a TEAM achievement. Ask any if the greats. They‚Äôll tell you.
@SSHOLDER29 Thanks Bobby! It was fun.
@DJMiddlecup I‚Äôm in tonight. 7-8 in CLE
@_MylesHighClub_ @gobucksburson That was the lineup to start the 4th quarter.
@SportsAholic6 Lol. Laughing my ass off. It‚Äôs his 4th. But who‚Äôs counting. Oh wait. You are. Counting and kissing rings. Use your eyes. Most complete player ever. Full stop
@AlexNFlorida @WEWS Perhaps on browns dot com
@EricEricCamCam @WEWS Not in the box score. W!
@LeBROCKETS2018 @FirstTake @RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith And it was a great run! 9 years between cold pizza and ft but when it went all debate, it became too much yelling for me. They‚Äôre still my dudes tho
@LeBROCKETS2018 @FirstTake @RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith We were....younger.
Indians beat the Cubs. Lebron daggers the pacers. And tomorrow night browns begin the turnaround. See you from 7-8pm on the Browns pre-draft special on @WEWS  #letsgo

@jasonbayly13181 No one needs to say it. Just watch.
And the tribe bats are MIA again. Over the last 26 innings they 1 run producing hit netting 1 run.
That was a microcosm of the season. +17 1st half,  -19 2nd half. Out-coached, uninspired, confounding.
@SpikeOnTheMic @CameronLynch50 @1025TheBone My dude!
@OhioSt1960 @CLBClippers I absolutely did! Wow. Epic artifact.
Now that!!! I would watch. https://t.co/d20pupO4D8

@Gurgs The same way it felt for you when we dominated the rockets in the early 90s. FYI all-time series. 39 BGSU. 39. toledo 4 ties. See ya in the fall!!
@THE_OSU This is my favorite question all day. I remember our coed softball team for being dominant. I remember both of you being good athletes. So scott, yes.
@TMantin30 Could happen...
@TCarosielli8 Know that game. And do your homework.
@brucejones13088 Fall of 2019. I actually know the exact number of seconds because I can‚Äôt wait.

@JackMullen2 Good question jack! I am a fan. That will come thru in the telecast. The audience is also fans of the browns. I have to measure my fandoms with objectivity. Believe me, I will carry a piece of every Browns fan with me into the booth. I will need surgery to remove my smile.
@JuliusvanRooyen Work hard!  Have fun. Seems simple but that‚Äôs really it.
@deleterious_2 Pb and banana no doubt!!!
@TobyFoote @bgsu I‚Äôm a seam head so my answer is World Series. But if you‚Äôre asking which one would mean more to the cleveland fan base I can‚Äôt even begin to guess what a browns super bowl would be like. Crazy!!!
@KirstynCrawford @maxwell_zane @alexdsolis Hi sweetie!!! Miss you and see you this afternoon.
@AnthonyJoki @1085Gridiron Have your people contact my people. Lol
@SteeleNewsLive Come to Bg and tour the facility! I encourage all young hs students considering journalism to visit a number of schools they‚Äôve identified as prospects. Go somewhere that will allow you to get practical experience and reps!!

@BGSUBirds That‚Äôs tough because it‚Äôs all been amazing but really the students. And the hockey games. And the football games. Oh and of course the basketball and baseball games and all of the other sports! Yea! That‚Äôs it. And pisanellos. And brathaus. Lol
@BGSUAdmissions @bgsu Get involved early with BGRSO and call games be a part of the program! Mostly get a great reel while you have this amazing facility at your disposal.
@Big_O_2020 I need more than 280 characters to answer that. It was mostly a blast. Always challenging. Sometimes frustrating but ultimately rewarding and the experience of a lifetime.

Pat was incredible. A tireless worker w/ several jobs. She always had a welcome ‚Äúhello jay!‚Äù  In 08 I lost my dad to cancer. I was away for several wks. When i returned she asked where I‚Äôd been. I told her I lost my dad.  She was genuinely sad for my loss. I am so sad for hers. https://t.co/wHCsKAE3S6
What the @Indians pitching staff is doing is unimaginable. While the entire offense is in a slump of historic levels the team is 6-5. Look at the avgs after tonight‚Äôs 2-1 win. Stunning!!! The team is hitting a MLB low .158 When the bats wake up....watch out!! https://t.co/FnX95jFBOZ

I get the sense this game could go 20 innings before the Indians score again. #deadbats
@BiggsTheKingpin It‚Äôs early. And it‚Äôs the white flag approach. Save the bullpen arms.
On the bright side Tomlin just lowered his ERA by about 22.5 runs.
@MikeJudge1027 Many more Mike!
@TomHoulf That was the only that inning NOT jt‚Äôs fault. He‚Äôd tell you that. Can‚Äôt locate. And with his stuff that‚Äôs a wrap.
Ok. Tomlin doesn‚Äôt have it tonight. Wow
@adnanESPN Pinstripes promote pressing.
Very nice win!!!! @cavs getting close.

@Roscoe728MBC @Indians Don‚Äôt over react. You‚Äôre right. It is one game. I‚Äôve seen that game a dozen times. Klube gets dunked for an early home run, game over. He‚Äôs an ace, so he faces a lot of aces. We made it interesting. We‚Äôll win the central then our revenge on the Yankees awaits.
@ronnievmartinez @kingLosCali @KingJames Listen to your eyes, not the finals storyline. Michaels game vs lebrons. Watch. It‚Äôs actually not that hard to see.
@jgraham702 @Indians I tend to agree Joe.

@TarN8tion @KJ2LiVE @oscarangulo_ It shines through!  Great kid.
I love Baseball for the pitch by pitch battle. For the one on one, inside a team game aspect. For the sun. And grass. And crack of the bat. For the way it bonds father and child. I love Baseball for a million reasons. #whydoyoulovebaseball? #OpeningDay2018 https://t.co/Jx4TZ7WKyi

@SkipSide @Browns I like Josh Allen a lot. Not sure if I like him at 1 though. Would love to interview he and Baker Mayfield.
@JStetters lol. I‚Äôve left the bear and ct thankfully behind!!! Back in the heart of it all state. Finally! #thrilled
@SkipSide @Browns The need for a qb has never been more glaring for any franchise in league history. Typically, running backs have to be sure fire hall of fame caliber to take that early. He is a workout warrior no doubt. There are red flags in his game stats though. Very tough, but critical call.
@EricEricCamCam @crawfordbounce He is working hard to master his form. He is very driven. And yes, extremely athletic. Lol

@brett_gibbons4 Can‚Äôt wait to try it!!!
@brett_gibbons4 Lol. What restaurant??
@DannySpeas @amyvandyken Which is an Olympic sport. Governed by Olympic rules. If confirmed by the b-sample, he broke the biggest one. Doesn‚Äôt matter why. Maria sharipova, Russian, was banned from playing tennis for using the same drug. All Russians are aware of the drug and that it‚Äôs a banned substance.
@DannySpeas @amyvandyken It‚Äôs the definition of cheating. Breaking a rule is cheating. He broke a rule=cheating
@Cowboykev72 Waiting for mY ESPN non-compete to expire.
@amyvandyken Completely agree. Why have rules if there is no punishment for breaking them. Like the world doesn‚Äôt know Olympic Athletes of Russia is actually Russia. All cleans athletes should be outraged.
@DannySpeas @amyvandyken The cheating in Russia was systemic. He is not being demonized for his countries wide spread cheating. He‚Äôs being demonized because HE failed a test for a banned substance.
@DannySpeas @amyvandyken It‚Äôs a banned substance. World class ‚Äúathletes‚Äù know well what‚Äôs on the list.  Like all athletes that test positive there is an appeals process. So we‚Äôll see. The belief is it helps protect ones energy source. That‚Äôs the best guess why it‚Äôs a banned substance.
@DannySpeas @amyvandyken It‚Äôs banned for a reason.
@amyvandyken Exactly!
@j2002smith To me it speaks to systemic cheating, still. If curlers are using, and they‚Äôve lost the benefit of doubt at this point, is any Russian athlete clean?!?
@LoveTheSacKings Understand this, you can‚Äôt spell corruption without an I an O and a C.

@pizzr718 One day.
@Jennings2James @cavs And so will the Cavs. With more time to gel and a Kevin Love back! See ya in June.
@sweet_baby1Ray Fans reacted to both.
@C_Fish07 Playoffs. Of course that happens. And it was 5 days.
@PaulMurphy1973 @cavs Last week. They were. Today. Completely different vibe.
@TheFakeSpaz @cavs Tell yourself that.
@The_Rege @cavs That‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôs 4 days. I‚Äôm not measuring 4 months from now. 4 days. Then to now. Wow!!
I know in sports, fans tend to over-react but here goes. I can‚Äôt remember in my life a bigger mood swing around a teams in a matter of 4 days than what I‚Äôve witnessed with the @cavs this week. Wow!!!
Gorgeous day in Naples. https://t.co/zTmev0a1p3

@GBertido And you never had an Espn show. Even more sad. No pity for me! My life is tremendous. Now get back in your mother‚Äôs basement troll.
@TalknGrubb Thanks.
Thoughts on Cavs trades: A lot to digest. Athleticism will help. This is what I know for sure, the old team was broken and wasn‚Äôt going to fix itself. Personality conflicts always makes winning harder. We‚Äôll know by April.
@katylanders It‚Äôs hard to tell. I‚Äôm trying to get my mind around what‚Äôs left. I know this, the old team was broken.

@rekdum69 @SCRESINC_BTRAIN Bet he wins a game.
@SCRESINC_BTRAIN True true.
@SCRESINC_BTRAIN Thanks!  His offense put up 42 against nfls top defense in the playoff loss. Focus on bad play calls in the clutch but the Steelers lost that game because of the defense. Stop somebody. 42 should‚Äôve been plenty.
@JCPrah If by ‚Äúfail‚Äù you mean his offenses over past 11 seasons are a collective 22 games over .500 yes. He‚Äôs failed. I‚Äôll take that at this point.
@Kyle_Wandel See Steelers offense last 6 years. See browns.
@TimBeeSports Better than what they have now.
@daveandbroshow I gave them. Very good thing.
Browns adding Todd Haley is a very good thing!!!
@horner_shane They will be in the mix. Play 90 games. See where they are. Then add a piece at the break. Like jay Bruce last year. Can‚Äôt overpay. We have arms galore.
@PSzamosszegi Nope. This game does just fine.

@cookienofilter No worries. It took me reading his bio and one tweet, the one about knocking out a woman at the peach bowl, to discount anything this clown says. Looks like cookie needs a filter like he needs followers and friends.
@JMB12789 Hey Bryan. I mean Felicia. Bye!!!
@akbywaydet Yep. That‚Äôs exactly how it works!!! I have mad powers that way.
@danzips1 No idea?? Bizarre.
Did harbaugh take an NFL gig at halftime?  Because it looks like he did.
Happy New Years!!! May 2018 be your best year yet.

Goodbye football!  See ya in September. 10 weeks to spring training!!!!
@COriginalmusic Who said I was offering support. No one.
Perfection so far for the Big 10. 7 wins. 0 defeats. Don‚Äôt screw it up Michigan!
@hop57 One works. One is hopelessly broken. Enjoy. And the pats lost to the bills last reg season.  16-0. In New England. Went in to win SB.
@Finmo12 Bama fan in Ohio. Got it!  Cya chief.
@DaveSprayberry @EricHorchy @John_Sabol @11W Oh you‚Äôre the worst of all fans. When your team sucks so much you root for anyone who beats your rival. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs come to for your brand of Michigan fans. Most are better than that! You clearly are not. Bye Felicia.
@DaveSprayberry @John_Sabol @EricHorchy @11W That‚Äôs it chief. Bye Felicia!! That was easy!
@DaveSprayberry @John_Sabol @EricHorchy @11W No. Go read your first tweet to me again chief. And that rookie of the year reference is a Baseball one. And I‚Äôm sure you meant ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù. At least I hope you did. ‚ÄúYou are‚Äù better than that. At least I hope you are.
@hop57 Idk. Patriots lost last reg season by more than 2 tds at home to buffalo. Didn‚Äôt score a point. They went in to win a super bowl.
@JMB12789 @Glaugh_Kid @NFLFantasy_More None here! It‚Äôs sports. Games. No rings for fans. Game ends. It‚Äôs over.
@jamiemurt64 Been saying that for 4 yrs.
@jamiemurt64 A bowl team is a bowl team. Just another part of a system hopelessly broken. #collegefraudball
@valorguitar Last year the patriots lost 16-0 at home to the bulls. Went on to win the super bowl. By your logic, and a system that votes 4 teams in, they miss the playoffs. Enjoy your broken system. #filledwithflaws
@jamiemurt64 Other bowls teams. #fact
@Glaugh_Kid @NFLFantasy_More Only team with 3 wins vs top 10s. Only team in nation in top 10 off and def.
@Glaugh_Kid @NFLFantasy_More 3 wins vs top 10, and ONLY team in the country ranked in top 10 offensively and defensively. Champs in a league currently 5-0 in bowl games. Imagine if the NFL voted on playoff teams and one bad loss kept you out. Laughable system. #mythical champion.
@garrett77870924 Bye Felicia.
Truth https://t.co/qlLbD6NDXt
@JLGallagher3 @John_Sabol @EricHorchy @11W No. They beat Oregon in the title game.
@DaveSprayberry @John_Sabol @EricHorchy @11W Lol.  30 yrs in the biz doesn‚Äôt qualify as a rook. Your career was far more meaningful than mine, no doubt. But you take a shot, you get one back. Lesson for you chief, go easy. Chill. Be kind. I mean, you‚Äôre a life saver right?  Act like it.

@BMitchell0121 No. Asking why they are never drafted. Ever.
@BMitchell0121 Not blindly draft osu players. But when Zeke and bosa are available and you trade picks or pass on sure fire buckeyes it does beg the question. Steelers always seem to get good buckeyes.

Extremely well done. All @MLS fans need to watch. #SaveTheCrew #BusinessmetricS #BS I was there from the beginning. I know how much Columbus loves the @ColumbusCrewSC https://t.co/UYHolE1UGS
@bradthemodel Enjoy!!! It goes so very fast!  Mine were 6 15 mins ago.
@bradthemodel Thanks Brad. Desire has much to do with it!!
I‚Äôve taught you well son!  Let me tell you once again, KEEP JUMPING!  Never stop jumping. You‚Äôre very good at it. https://t.co/OeQZrQiY8j
@Official_AGmann Sadly it will have to happen without. I leave Bg tomorrow am. Lol. But have 1 in my absence.
@DanBolyard @ThisIsRobThomas @EddieTrunk @taylormomsen @LZZYHALE @ShannaMoakler @DamonJOfficial @ESPNDari @ZMyersOfficial Happy Birthday Dan!!
Bgsu hockey ticket still available. First responder is in LA. he won‚Äôt make it time.
@ChadSonkin Pick up your ticket at will call. Walk in go straight past all the ticket ropes to the table.
@ChadSonkin Collect at ice rink. I‚Äôm just pulling in.
@Official_AGmann @BarstoolBG @bgsu @PresidentMazey @realDonaldTrump Lol. Doubt you want me as prez. Meetings at brathaus wouldn‚Äôt fly.
BGSU hockey fans I have 1 extra ticket. (Sorry just one). First come first served.
@DevinICrosby @TeamJuJu @CharlieBatch16 @steelers Lol.
@GhostWriter1970 Thanks Anthony!
I‚Äôm a fan of the Dorsey hire for the Browns. Great track record. HE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE AND HAD SUCCESS!  That‚Äôs a step in the right direction!!!
@abbbreiderr I was told it was canceled.
@DavidRDupont @BG_IndyNews @bgsu Thanks David!!
@AndyFishman1 A guy can dream right?!
@Formidable_Kibs I‚Äôll be off the bus by then.
@Deg4returns Lol. Just lol
Must get this next hire right. There is no room for making another massive blunder. The cleveland browns are on the clock. https://t.co/a2tM8bi8U4
@henzach11 Thanks Henry!
@Autumnstev03 Terrific Job!
@KyleatRappflex @tennisprof My pleasure Kyle.
@BradenPogue Thanks Brandon.
@Dc_Or_Nothing @AnionSports Well done Don!!
@BroadcasterZach Very funny Zach. Bg!!! Over Toledo.
@cmrump @bgsu Thanks Chris!
@HistoryBoyle Thanks Joe!!
@DHec51 Done!  That‚Äôs easy.
@loomis_brittany Glad it resonated.
@drew_reliford Sure.
Looking forward to it!! https://t.co/pU9giOOKEi
@DHec51 Thank you!  That‚Äôs my point!!! Not the 1-4 seeds but the 5 and even 6 seeds which would be 9-12 league wide.
@Patrick_Hall_ @bgsu Sorry, not this year.
@DHec51 The buckeyes won it as a 4 so stop it.
@TheBigCatfish @dpaoloni Talk to me in 8!years when the tv contract is up. They can‚Äôt keep getting it wrong.
@_BrianBlakeley No Brian. They don‚Äôt. What do they ensure. I‚Äôll help you. That you get a meaningless banner. End game, win a national title. Conference title has nothing to do with that lineage.
@WillLarrick Oh it‚Äôs coming will. I assure that.
@SaveTeamCasey @caplannfl Thanks Jon
@DonDoncarey4 I enjoy Rocky River!
Hmmmmm. Interesting. Give the people what they want. https://t.co/kM0qfXkcda
@timmy2putt 8!years. So we get 8 more mythical champions. Dilly dilly.
@ICMBroadcasting Great. Let‚Äôs abolish Nfl divisions and vote on the top 12 teams to advance to post season. Let me know how that works out. #foolish
@TownieIrish Hey Jim!  I‚Äôm not sure but I will check.
@TBSavage Oh. Like bama paying for playing Mercer. Got it!! Laughable.
I‚Äôve invited family from Sandusky!  Excited to address those in attendance. https://t.co/oCwqQyMbzP
@WillLarrick Ask Alabama-Mercer fans. The regular season still decides the 8 playoff teams. So of course it will mean something. That‚Äôs crazy talk will
@ICMBroadcasting 9 and 10 have no shot to get through that gauntlet. None. 5 -8 do.
Joel knows. https://t.co/S6w7c9eNzE
@bdenman4 @mikewickett But they do! Conferences. They just don‚Äôt use them the same way. Just imagine, not all of the nfl division winners get in to the playoffs. Just 6. We‚Äôll be leaving 2 out. No wildcards. No auto bids for division winners. We‚Äôll just leave it up to a vote! #lunacy
@MichaelMPierce @dhanlin3 In the business of ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù now?  I‚Äôve seen that melt down many times. You should move to Las Vegas. Let me know how that works chief.
@Joshyy_7 Who really never have a shot anyway.
@MistaMike I wasn‚Äôt ok with it. Look what happened.
@dhanlin3 Hahah. Thats you‚Äôre white flag. I‚Äôm done here.
@B1GHomie @crawfordbounce Lol
@chewyredding @dhanlin3 One of us is trolling for attention. One of us chief.
@dhanlin3 Can‚Äôt explain away Mercer.  Can‚Äôt do it. Where‚Äôs the oklahoma caliber opponent?? It‚Äôs not there.
@B1GHomie @crawfordbounce And where Penn State in that list?? https://t.co/P8hnzS5JHs
@B1GHomie @crawfordbounce U wrong. Just wrong. Lol
@JenNimePalumbo @ProudMemberBbn A top 10 3 loss team. Strip bama off the jersey and give that season to say, ole miss, Miss state. Texas a&amp;m. Then they become Wisconsin in this conversation.
@dhanlin3 Bama got blown out by a 3 loss team. So there‚Äôs that.
@mikeiosue @dpaoloni If 538 said it... well then... it must be right!  See 2016 election. #youhadonejob
@dhanlin3 Soooooo... schedule Mercer not Oklahoma. Got it!!!
@Wolverine310 Jay is on paid vacation til late 2019. Loving life!!!
@MichiganPorVida Oh please. You have no voice in this convo. Don‚Äôt wind me up.
Mom?!?  Really???? https://t.co/8BVPG8EBKp
@Hassel_Chris Are they a top 4 team in your mind Chris?
@r_volz That‚Äôs the problem. Each committee re-writes the rules to fit their agenda that year. Confntitle games matter...but...  the but means they don‚Äôt.
@ShawnMega @deanishisname No they wouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the point. 5 power conf winners get auto bids. 3 at large. Simple.
@hughhewitt I always knew you to be a wise man Hugh. Funny how educators can‚Äôt figure out the obvious.
@ProudMemberBbn @JenNimePalumbo Bama lost by 2 tds to a 3 loss team. OSU beat Penn State and Wisc both top 5 teams at the time. Bama beat Fresno and Mercer.
As long as there is a human vote to decide playoffs, the process itself, like humans, is flawed. Imagine if the nfl, nba or mlb VOTED on teams to advance to playoffs.  Power 5 winners get auto bids. Let the humans pick 6-8. Take the egos and pomposity out of it! https://t.co/kM0qfXkcda
@dpaoloni Exactly opposite. Instead of it only having meaning for the 8 or so teams in the mix for 4 spots, it will have meaning for the 16-20 fighting for 8. Win. Win.
@JeffreySorrell4 It will.
@Tucsonmike520 We lose a week from the reg season. I can do without Alabama-Mercer.
@bschwartz07 It ALWAYS holds true. FOLLOW. THE. MONEY. Works here too.
NCAA playoffs:
@adidasjunkie350 @woodi19 They look at QUALITY wins. Well they should. But this year.
@maxlpom @OhioStFootball That‚Äôs been a joke for decades.
Committee considered last year ABSOLUTELY. They had a choice between Clemson V OSU or Clemson V Alabama. NO WAY they ignored those results.  The system is still flawed. No PAC 12. No BIG 10. You can‚Äôt invite 4 with 5 power conferences and call it a TRUE title. #mustbe8
@NickP118 Exactly!
@adidasjunkie350 They beat 2 top 4 teams. Bama beat Mercer and Fresno.
@jjaquis324 Great school!!
@BPfromCLE If it means something to one team and not another, it means nothing.
@Mistah_Vaughn That‚Äôs stupid. Of course it matters. Too many losses will keep you out of title game anyways.
This committee had a choice. Clemson vs OSU or Clemson vs BAMA. Won‚Äôt hear for a second they didn‚Äôt consider last years playoff games in deciding which matchup would be better for TV. Last year absolutely mattered. Just own it.
@JimOShea4 Reg season?? The committee just told OSU stop scheduling Oklahoma. They told Alabama, go ahead, keep scheduling Mercer.
@jillclary68 Not soon enough.
@jjaquis324 Always knew what I wanted to do.
Conference championships mean nothing. They are bake sales.  OSU got in a few yrs ago by not MAKING the conference title game. This year they WIN it and miss and that‚Äôs fine. But let‚Äôs end the charade of title games and begin an 8 team playoff as soon as this TV deal ends.
@jjaquis324 You should absolutely consider BGSU!!
@cledawgbob Lot of range.
@TheSOTMShow @joetoohey @KirstynCrawford Well....
@jrod24 @joetoohey @KirstynCrawford Thanks Jrod. Hope you‚Äôre well!
Tennessee is getting someone that knows what‚Äôs up and tells it the way he sees it. https://t.co/ZACilZ7iEx
@IvraII @joetoohey @KirstynCrawford Lol. Me too.
One of my favorite shots from my beautiful daughters wedding!!  And a shoutout for my new career in woodworking. Lol. @joetoohey @KirstynCrawford  https://t.co/YGU6FDRBkk
@PerkinsYthFball @ericwobser I welcome any and all from Sandusky excited to see Char again!!
@PerkinsYthFball @ericwobser Looking forward to seeing you.
@PerkinsYthFball @ericwobser Told them I want to buy two but haven‚Äôt heard anything in specifics to how to pay. Need to get my Amex number to someone.
@BSU_BRONCOS The market has a voice. It MUST be heard.
@ledwithd @jasonmizzou Oh believe me, me too!!
@ledwithd @jasonmizzou They have to pay me through contract.
@ImReallyTrilly @espn Thank you sir for the kind words!  Appreciate the Cleveland love.
@TyRink14 @espn @Buccigross Bg here. Bucc is Heidelberger.
@TyRink14 @espn @Buccigross Bucc is insanely talented!  He‚Äôs safe.
@jasonmizzou Non compete until late 2019
@howieschwab Wow! Good for you friend. Glad you‚Äôre well.
@MikeMicasherman Thanks mike!
@johnny_law49 @BrittMcHenry @FOXSports Thanks Johnny!
Remember this @danajacobson       https://t.co/eI4RtZL18K via @youtube
@tignerosu I trade to be fair. Glad you noticed. Thanks Doug.
@paulgero Both have the potential to be. Darnold for me for now...
@Rmeyer15 @BrittMcHenry High praise Ryan. Thank you.
@howieschwab Miss you brother!! How are you??
@brandenobv @BrittMcHenry @LeBatardShow Failing is too harsh. Still making money. Lots of it. Trouble is, it‚Äôs not nearly as profitable as it once was. And it won‚Äôt be returning anywhere near to its past self.
@Meatrecruiter Love Tampa. May be coming back!!!
@JoeBucsFan He did.
@Italian_Ang23 Changing times Angelo.
@Meatrecruiter Yikes. For a second I thought you were the other jim trotter.
@kts88 Sad
@damon8755 The market is speaking.
@TrevorVallejo Ty!
@DiamondHoggers Not my company.
@July041776 Thank you.
@JStetters @TODAYshow @woodypaige I miss that too.
Thinking of all of my former colleagues impacted by today‚Äôs news. Change is never easy. Please see this as opportunity.  https://t.co/w8QUtz8P3V
@JStetters @TODAYshow Thanks for the kind words Jonathan.
Killin‚Äô it bro!!! Great sound. https://t.co/8hePn2endd
@ConorPernetti13 big game Saturday!! Wish I could be there. I‚Äôll be out of state but I‚Äôm wishing you all the best!  Leave it out there!!
@Hough75 Lol. Ditto. Let‚Äôs agree on this, both would do much better with the browns.
@Hough75 So let‚Äôs compare apples to apples. College records.   Again. Urban: 175-31. Your guy: 57-31. I. Win.
@Hough75 10-3 last year.  8-4 this year.
@Hough75 Same number of super bowl wins as urban. 0. But 3 behind urban in national championships. Just stop. You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself.
@Hough75 If by well you mean 8-4 and 4 losses in the big 10 and sole possession of 4th in the east division, then ok, I guess he‚Äôs doing well. Keep overachieving.
@Hough75 This is just sad now. Hate elsewhere. My numbers made the winning case. See ya
@Hough75 Weak. Year 3. Takes a step back from year 2. Plenty of his players there now.
@Hough75 My guy:  175-31. 3 National titles.  Your guy:  57-31 0 national titles.   My guy: 10-3 in bowl games.         Your guy: 2-2 in bowl games.             If your guy wins the 118 games in a row, or doesn‚Äôt lose for 9 seasons, he will still trail my guy.  My guy wins, easily.
@Hough75 And tough for urban to get a college team to a super bowl. #rocketscience
@Hough75 In Jim Harbaugh's first 3 seasons at Michigan he is now:  - 0-3 against Ohio State - 1-2 against Michigan State - 0-4 vs. OSU, MSU at home - 0-6 as an underdog - 1-7 against Top 10 teams
@Hough75 National titles?  Urban has them at multiple schools?  How does your guy do vs rivals? Let me help you with that. Not well. I have all the evidence on my side. You lose. Jim loses. Again. And it‚Äôs you‚Äôre not your.
@Hough75 It was a road win vs a rival by 11 pts. That‚Äôs about the difference in talent.
@Hough75 I never have to wonder who is the better coach. The results don‚Äôt lie. They‚Äôre very consistent.
@BazeelWells #moron
@BazeelWells Of course not. He wasn‚Äôt in the game. Do yourself a favor. Understand how team sports work. You are clueless. He played. He made big plays. He helped his team to a win today. He earned the win.
@Bgfalcon91 Matters not at all. Heading to big 10 title game.
@BazeelWells That‚Äôs totally different. He didn‚Äôt play in that game. Today‚Äôs is not up for debate. He played. Made big plays. In a 60 minute battle each play matters. He earned a win today with all of his teammates.
@BazeelWells Nothing??  Really. Hell I‚Äôd hate to be your teammate. Win as team. Lose as team. He played. Made many big plays. They all count. Stop it.
@Jtdyer @Niemiec84 No reason??? From Ohio? There‚Äôs your reason.
@BazeelWells Do they win without the point for which he responsible?  I‚Äôll answer that. No.
@danajacobson @TheLazarusman2 Sweet!!!!
@mikevanevery84 Don‚Äôt need one. Victory. Ahhhhh
@TheLazarusman2 @danajacobson 1 million dollars. Our biggest bet yet. I‚Äôm so pumped.
@BazeelWells He played. They won. It‚Äôs the entire teams win!
Ohio State does it again. Urban still perfect with the buckeyes vs mich. JT leaves OSU 4-0 vs the wolverines. Damn this is fun!!!!
Here we go!!  O-H
@sandusky2018 @ericwobser How do I get one?
@officer37 You bet frank. Hi to all there.
@trumanshow33 You too Tom!!
@JohnnyBlaze_82 I‚Äôm sorry Jonathon. But you do have family. Wife, daughter. Enjoy them. Better days ahead!
I‚Äôd like to wish everyone a very Happy Thanksgiving! Enjoy family, friends, food and football!!
@1Shane_Adkins Oh I know. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs funny!
Truth is always funny! https://t.co/LCSZJlGWlM
@reddusfoximus @jaymee @OvertimeScottB Thanks Pam!! Hope you‚Äôre well friend!!
@kenyon1524 Love CF. Looking there. Hope you‚Äôre well Jim.
@emilykennard @ringer Thank you Emily!
@ZackRaab @bryancurtis @jaysonst Thanks Zack!
@taylourJohnson Good work if you can get it.
@118sherman Love hearing stories like that. Glad we could help. Hope you‚Äôre well now!
@jimszoke @mattharris1079 It only serves cheap beer. So always!!
@bkline97 I‚Äôm really glad to hear they‚Äôre enjoying my time there. I know I have!!
@MikeStein1000 I love Cleveland!
@drewtsmall And I LOVE being there!  Back in 2 weeks!
@3inaburningcar Sad but true.
@mattharris1079 Anything for you Harris. But bars are my specialty. https://t.co/faSwUq4xTe
@MrVanDep Thank you sir. Looking forward to doing it again!
@Jakeyer Late 2019.
@MrVanDep Absolutely.
Nice work Bryan! Glad to see those you spoke with are doing well!! https://t.co/ejMElTbdMk
@jaybhnk Make a list of questions. Dm them to me. Be glad to answer what I can.
@jonathanrobles @ringer Thanks Jonathon!
Looking forward to it! https://t.co/uz1zCUgvMF
@CoachReiff @BGathletics @BGSUSoftball Name it!! Love to.
@LindseyParryZA @BruinJumps @CheckTheSky And 41k is much like watching grass grow. A preference.
@LindseyParryZA @BruinJumps @CheckTheSky They NEVER breakaway during the final 1k. Which is when the 5K is won or lost.
@Maddentrish Love you sis!  Enjoy corey for thanksgiving.
@BruinJumps @CheckTheSky Tv has long missed how to cover t&amp;F. They would much rather show 15 minutes of a 5K which looks painstaking the same until the final lap over the drama of a complete field competition.
@BGSU_Jour_PR It was a pleasure.
@CheckTheSky Quite possibly the best OVERALL long jump competition EVER!  Amazing depth, drama and performance.
@Maddentrish Go sis!!!
Very well done!!! It‚Äôs ‚ùåichigan week!! Let‚Äôs get another WON. #BUCKEYES https://t.co/j405QbZsdQ
@TimHaut13 @jaybhnk @cooltrav @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Absolutely. If it happens just see how many fans turn out. That‚Äôs the measuring stick. If more than 50,000 turn out I have drastically misread the fan base I thought I knew. I‚Äôm doubting that happens.
@cooltrav @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Done here. Enjoy your....whatever.
@jaybhnk @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 That is certain.
@jaybhnk @cooltrav @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Thanks!  Done with this utter nonsense to self promote. Narcissistic.
@cooltrav @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Im using the word March as used in protest. To parade is of course to March, which in that form means to move along. The protest form means to gather and move along to demonstrate resistance or advocate change. Parade does not apply there.
@ASwanson33 @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 #smart
@John_Sabol @LauraHarrisWFTS @SarinaFazanWFTS @BryanKBOI Funny how they love to dismantle!! Lol. I‚Äôve seen the same thing.
@Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Not asking for help. Again, parade = celebrate. March = protest.
@theclemsonkid @Reflog_18 @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 To that, I raise a glass.
@theclemsonkid @Reflog_18 @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Protest and parade are oxymoronic. Parade celebrates. March protests. That‚Äôs the rub.
@Hordfest @dchabz @Reflog_18 @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 Exactly. It also re-enforces what they‚Äôve long know, fans care so much they‚Äôll throw a parade. He will laugh at that gesture and use as further evidence. They. Are. Hooked!!
@dchabz @Reflog_18 @Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 The best way to show that, don‚Äôt show up one Sunday. No one!! The image of a stadium with a thousand fans in it is worth a billion words, not dollars.
@Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 @Reflog_18 Put your misery in public display and let more national jokes about cleveland fly. Ready, break! Sounds like a plan.
@themediashed Lol. What up shed.
@IanBodenhoff @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 @Reflog_18 Well, one just asked, what does it matter if we go 1-15 or 0-16.  There is your answer.
@Hordfest @StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 @Reflog_18 The celebration is for 0-16 only. Slice it how you wish. That‚Äôs celebrating losing.
@FanOf_TheLand @LeadFoot_Lads82 @Reflog_18 Doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be donated either way.
@CheckTheSky @SportsCenter They don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know. Except John Anderson. He knows what‚Äôs up. Keep doing you‚Äôre thing! #gimmickcenter
@theclemsonkid @jaybhnk @itsafunnyhat @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas They no longer mention the browns because they are no longer part of any relevant conversations.
@theclemsonkid @jaybhnk @itsafunnyhat @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas Throw a parade for an 0-16. Watch the tide swing. The poking fun has stopped because, we‚Äôll what‚Äôs the point?
@skeatskeat2 @BGSU1982 Loyalty. It‚Äôs a crazy thing that way. You only root for your teams when they‚Äôre winning?? Lose faith easily?  We don‚Äôt.
@clevelandteams @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas Not at all. I root my ass off for them every Sunday. Want the best for them! Doesn‚Äôt mean I sugar coat the truth. I support! Not blindly.
@levichloe @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam You sir are a vet, and thusly saved from my wrath.  Thank you for your service and go Browns! Oh, I‚Äôm very awake. And thankfully no longer a ‚Äúmedia type‚Äù. Proud to say I never was.
@StardustRedding @LeadFoot_Lads82 @Reflog_18 What does it matter? That you have to ask highlights part of the problem. Go ahead, go down as celebrating historical incompetence. Losing breeds losing. We‚Äôre now seeing one of its many ugly forms manifested in an apathetic fan base. I‚Äôm thrilled most browns fans agree with me.
@KCarter92474 When my non compete ends. They pay me through 2019. I‚Äôll be back!  Meantime....Paid vacation :)
@ClevStrikesBack Which, happens to be part of players.
@mtoth33 @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam Not really weird at all. The fact NO ONE gets it should be a hint.    https://t.co/0bwBp3n6BT
@KMTG23 @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam Oh I agree. A parade is not the way to do it. Boycott a game. Everyone stay away. That would be embarrassing and get everyone‚Äôs attention in a much more practical way. National media would pay attention. A parade would provide a 30 second laugh-fest video clip at the fans expense
@theclemsonkid @jaybhnk @itsafunnyhat @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas Yea enjoy that ‚Äúsatire‚Äù I fully understand the concept. You WILL provide laughter trust me. It will be used as an example to represent ALL cleveland fans. Like the burning jersey. Im confident it will be the worlds smallest parade.
@skeatskeat2 @BGSU1982 No.  We‚Äôre loyal.
@LastTardigrade @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam Who the hell is mcneil??
@Animaleyz I don‚Äôt know who that is.
@SALB216 @Reflog_18 @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam Yea. That‚Äôs a mentality. I think you can figure out the kind. Enjoy.
@RyInCBus So we‚Äôre halfway home then? Right??
@CLETrumpFan @jzura74 This is my intention.
@jaybhnk @itsafunnyhat @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas March denotes protest. Now that I could get into.
@jaybhnk @itsafunnyhat @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas Better.
@BMitchell0121 @NickWilson923 All we need?  That‚Äôs it. Oh nevermind then.
@CaicoNotGeico 1-25. But who‚Äôs counting.
@cleveland_cam @itsafunnyhat @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas That‚Äôs the hope! Appreciate the civil dialogue.
@itsafunnyhat @cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas That‚Äôs comedy. It‚Äôs funny. I get that. 0-16 isn‚Äôt funny. It‚Äôs pathetic. Enjoy your parade.
@216_Born @jzura74 You know me well Tim. But I‚Äôm closer than ever before.
@kylegratz @egoldie80 Of course. A middle of the pack defense. Don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs a top 5 defense. It is not. It‚Äôs improving and making progress. Hold off on the party. They‚Äôre 0-10.
@BrettMHancock @NickWilson923 Laughing that you‚Äôre applauding the defense as a huge win. It‚Äôs is middle of the pack to top third. Hit me when it‚Äôs too 5. Guess that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre 1-25.
@cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas Agree to disagree. What I see is a celebration of complete failure. Just me.
@Browns_SZN @vladvaler So to summarize its hue not sashi. You lost me with your endorsement of the on field product this season.
@CaddyMikeCorrao Oh I will be there. One of my favorite vacay destinations.
@jzura74 That is the single biggest issue I have with this group. Let Pryor get away only to reportedly try to work a trade to bring him back which would have cost MORE assets. That and the bengals trade debacle have me close to the brink of kissing them off.
@NotJustinGeorge This statement is likely truth. Sadly.
@Browns_SZN @vladvaler They are. Or I am. End of rope for me. They have this offseason to get it right. I refuse to condone incompetence with my rabid support past this debacle. #seenenough
@1buckeyetom One unit playing well equals defeat when another unit fails miserably. There are no partial victories. It‚Äôs a loss. Another one. Takes a team.
@araver2 @egoldie80 And I believe a few have.
@TodSaidWhat To say ‚ÄúALL‚Äù costs you serious credibility. An organization wins as one and loses as one. Period. No one is ever due ALL of the credit or ALL of the blame. Avoid absolutes.
@cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas You protest with a lack of patronage. Always works. You celebrate their incompetence, you endorse it.
@cleveland_cam @TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas Utter nonsense. You don‚Äôt throw a parade for 0-16. That!!! Is on whoever organizes it and attends.
@TMC_PREZ Been preaching that for 3 years.
@michaelritter70 @egoldie80 Heard an NBA analytics guy is on deck. Joking. Maybe not. Probably.
@DJSeb9 @KJChmura Stunning how in the browns history they have ALWAYS taken great pains to AVOID drafting OSU players. Stunning. Steelers have drafted far more. Compare the two organizations. Don‚Äôt rattle off the buckeyes cleveland drafted. I know them all. The passes far outweigh the takes.
@Be_Led_ Correct. Of course.
@CaddyMikeCorrao Damn!! Need more notice. I love the INN course!!!!
@TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam Than laugh privately. Individually. Laugh publicly and collectively and I ASSURE you the sports world will focus its laughter and ridicule on you.
@Jakeyer @root4cleveland That is an extremely liberal use of the word great. Extremely.
@Be_Led_ That is, by far, the funniest thing I‚Äôll read today. You just took two of the greatest ever at the two most vital positions and put them on the Browns. That is the biggest abuse of the ‚Äúif so then such‚Äù argument maybe ever.
@hasmith84 Today the offense played well. In the bigger sample size they are near last in the league in key categories.
@TheKevinBeard @KenCarman @HammerNation19 @CaseyKulas @cleveland_cam Enjoy that misery. Incompetence celebrated in any form is beyond complacency. It is lunacy. Frankly, I‚Äôm embarrassed by the notion ANYONE could throw a ‚Äúparade‚Äù to celebrate and highlight such a source of embarrassment.
@BigMr216 Yes. I feel way worse for fans.
@AshleyNevel Ouch.
@eddickson25 There is talent on every team. Stop saying that!!! These guys are paid. There better be talent. The problem is there is not NEARLY enough. Stop with that narrative.
@1buckeyetom Other than that Mrs. Lincoln how did you enjoy the play?
@waynekerrphelge They all are. All of them. I see too many players at too many positions that we could have and should‚Äôve drafted performing at high levels elsewhere. Every organization has the tone set at the very top. We have failed miserably in that area.
@clevelandteams I do. He was handcuffed on selecting talent. Didn‚Äôt have a big enough say. He is grinding. This is killing him trust me. That said, he has performed below an acceptable level and will pay the price for it.
@PlymouthTrack Played a great def. great!
@root4cleveland This!!! A million times this!!!
@vladvaler 1-25. Trust me. That change will be made the Monday am after this train wreck ends.
@KJChmura That is part of this too.
@asportsguy I saw things that I liked. Some progression for Kizer. What‚Äôs most troubling is he still has no mental clock ticking when he drops to throw. Things must slow down for him or he has no chance.
@siebs71 No. Front office has provided the paint. Don‚Äôt blame all of this on the artist who has limited colors to work with.
For 50 years the battle cry of Browns fan has been ‚Äúmaybe next year‚Äù  At this point I would settle for ‚Äúmaybe next decade‚Äù
@RickMuber @espn Buttfumble.
Browns defense. A-  browns offense D-  feel so bad for the players and coaches. They are grinding with no results. Please draft better players. Please.
@TerryKilbane Wish I could go. Left today.
Thanks Ryan but remember I‚Äôm just one set of eyes. Keep working!!! https://t.co/0Vdlt3crjX
@JeffreyMeDailey I guess that‚Äôs not playing it safe.

@JamieLindsay @scottpeachey I always pitched inside. Always. Still do. Every once in a while up and in. A reminder the fat part of the plate is off limits.
@Cleveland_Wins Scouting and drafting has been suspect. I do like both Garrett and ogbah.
@fordhamrams85 Nice to meet you as well Jim!  Thanks and best to you.
@scottpeachey Thanks Scott. Every once in a while I‚Äôm driven to that kind of approach.
@Rease2x_216 @cleflygirl15 Oh I don‚Äôt know. When are the Steelers ever horrible, patriots? It doesn‚Äôt have to be that way.
@Sammy_B20 Thanks for the laugh!
@Cleveland_Wins They came into yesterday 28th in the nfl in points allowed. They lived down to that ranking.
@Drew_Bresco But kudos on the profile pic. Cracked me up!!!
@Drew_Bresco Never
@horner_shane @Riles64 Who‚Äôs his coach?
@SteelValleyMatt @HammerNation19 @TonyGrossi @TheRealTRizzo Gotcha. You play the lottery too right?  Come on Matt!
@Rease2x_216 You mean like Wentz and Watson?
@Scottkwou Hanging with teams and losing by 14? That‚Äôs your encouragement?  Be better. Expect more.
@SteelValleyMatt @HammerNation19 @TonyGrossi @TheRealTRizzo Wake up man. This isn‚Äôt doom. This is reality. You paying attention?  What‚Äôs the lions record? That look like a playoff team to you?  Keep buying that hype peddled out of the factory. Sure fire way to ensure the misery continues.
@AstroMickeyT @cleveland_cam Hit me in Jan.
@Rease2x_216 5 years?!?!?!  Man you crazy.
@SteelValleyMatt Want to buy a bridge?
@horner_shane Wait, did you see the end of the first half???? Maybe you were taking a bathroom break. I think someone else was too.
Looking at the schedule I don‚Äôt see where a win comes from.  Maybe Baltimore but probably not. 0-16 looking like a good bet. When will it end?
@NoshPI33 @andy_baskin @DustinFox37 @RuiterWrongFAN @HammerNation19 @WFNYScott No explanation.
@yoopercarver Normalcy restored.
@KJChmura That!!! Is the NCAA in a nutshell.
@Fiainkoka Non compete yes.
@dufr01 @JoeMers @SkrticX @Cleveland_PL @Browns @terrypluto @Livy70 @WindhorstESPN Paper route. Best first job ever!
@Harry0we @crawfordbounce You did!
@Fiainkoka I wish. Espn won‚Äôt allow it.
The #afootballlife on @LarryFitzgerald does two things. It highlights Larry as a hall of fame football player but more importantly it shows he is a hall of fame person in every way possible! True winner!
@elmsy1922 George was incredible!!!

@JasonJones0144 Oh. I will.
@rookegreenwood Yep. That‚Äôs me. Lol
@EricC1025 Haven‚Äôt been there since April. Part of the last cuts. But thank you. High praise. Stu set the bar.
@CoachGraffin All I watch now.
@MikeAmmo @JadeMcCarthy @jaymee We‚Äôre thinking of starting our own network JSPN. Jade, Jaymee and Jay 24-7. Layoffs were done by first initial basis. All the Js...gone. Kidding. Maybe not.
@Zig76Cody For contract employees they pay out the entire sum remaining. More of a long term work force reduction than short term play.

Against a top ranked Penn state defense. #focus https://t.co/Di2TqJIpEp
@A2BuckNutz Precisely. So why would you try to add a playmaker that may win a few games (highly unlikely) and get out of the top pick? #nonsense
@A2BuckNutz You‚Äôre not paying attention. ‚ÄúDoing something‚Äù by trying to acquire ‚Äúplaymakers‚Äù in Oct?? Teams are dying to unload those this time of yr.
@waynethecane Lol. Good times!!
@Todd_Pitt New level of it in fact.
@RC_cog The joke, is clearly YOU. Tweeting with a fake handle. Not owning anything you share. Hiding behind a logo, likely from your moms basement.
@crolland71 Don‚Äôt mention it chief.
@RC_cog Writing skills also flawed.
@RC_cog Your reading comprehension skills are flawed. Sad!!!!
@spiroagnew69 You don‚Äôt fix an 0-8 team in October.
@Covertwo81 Baseball season is over chief. Deal.

@MarkMheston The duping continues.
I have figured out the Browns problems and can sum it up in one word:  EVERYTHING
#analytics
@Beardofknowldge Someone has to. #analytics
@Beardofknowldge @FirstTake @danajacobson It‚Äôs a different show for sure.
@AlexMorgan_33 You. Are. Right. #buckeyes
@Beardofknowldge Trade down. Get a couple of 2s and 3s for the 2028 draft. Thinking there, by then someone else will own/run the team. Real value there.
@RyanTramel Same for me. I‚Äôm 52.
@IIICodeBlueIII Yup. We‚Äôre #2. We‚Äôre #2.
@hawaiijames808 Wait, there‚Äôs been a trade. The browns send their first pick to the Steelers for 2 2nds and 2 3rds in 2028-2029.
@AlexMorgan_33 Fantasy Alex. Fantasy. Or go live life. Always an option. Movie. Hike. Road trip. Anything but burning 3.5 hrs a week on that nonsense.
@A_Baca55 Week 12
@RyanTramel Now you‚Äôre getting somewhere aryan!! When they make the effort, I‚Äôll make the effort.
@MattSiroskeyNBA Some?  One would help.
@AlexMorgan_33 STOP WATCHING. it‚Äôs much easier.
Halfway there. 0-8
@RyanTramel What do you mean?
@DaveW_21 @Witnessgabe Doh!!!
OSU. WOW!!!!!! #buckeyes
@crawfordblast34 Get em kid!!!
@theadored1 That‚Äôs a legitimate concern. Many players have that. What‚Äôs odd is he believed the court was leftover from the 70s. But that‚Äôs just me.

@jaybhnk He was a smart man.
@horner_shane I will say this. He‚Äôs been hamstrung by a bad roster. Not his fault.
@pderenda80 mine too. Always will be. Long before this group. Long after this group. We should all expect and demand better. #Irememberwhenweweregood
@horner_shane I‚Äôd like to think he wouldn decision the past few weeks have led to more doubt. Jets game. Ugh. Qb shuffle. Ugh. Not getting ball to DJ ugh.
@pderenda80 @NickWilson923 @ShaunEberle @DreKnott @johnnyfire817 @radum27 Of course!! I love this team. Root like hell for this team. Live and die every Sunday with this team. Bleed over this teams failures.
@pderenda80 @NickWilson923 @ShaunEberle @DreKnott @johnnyfire817 @radum27 That‚Äôs not my mess. Or the fans. If they look to us that‚Äôs even worse. His business. He needs to figure it out or sell to someone who can.
@browns5719 @DreKnott @NickWilson923 @pderenda80 @ShaunEberle @johnnyfire817 @radum27 You would think, but there are blindly loyal fans arguing to enable another regime with the stability play. The house is on fire.
@pderenda80 @NickWilson923 @ShaunEberle @DreKnott @johnnyfire817 @radum27 I‚Äôm clearly wasting it on you. Fishers career equity earned him that time. What‚Äôs this regimes career equity. I‚Äôve got that. NONE! Peddle on
@NickWilson923 @pderenda80 @ShaunEberle @DreKnott @johnnyfire817 @radum27 That was 3 yrs too long.
@pderenda80 @NickWilson923 @ShaunEberle @DreKnott @johnnyfire817 @radum27 Really?  See the rams. Turned it over until they got it right. There are many other examples. Keep drinking that stability look-aid.

@JXDubya üëç
@NickWilson923 @SCHWANNY4531 Love your thinking! I would too! Enjoyed the back and forth. Let‚Äôs agree on this. We love the Browns, LOVE! And we should all demand better.
@NickWilson923 @DreKnott @radum27 So you believe this is the management team that will lead the Browns back to respectability. That‚Äôs a choice. Yours. And I hope it‚Äôs right.
@NickWilson923 @SCHWANNY4531 Are you really Nicholas Haslam?
@JXDubya Sadly my football weekends focus way more on what happens saturdays than Sunday‚Äôs.
@SCHWANNY4531 @NickWilson923 That‚Äôs biz!
@cooltrav I agree. Totally.
@B_Rody1 @JakeLake720 This is accurate.
@JXDubya Never. Browns forever. Ride or die. If not the Browns, no team for me. It‚Äôs getting closer each year.
@SCHWANNY4531 @NickWilson923 Which is why I threw it in.
@MasonTalksCLE @NickWilson923 Because they were.
@NickWilson923 @MaryLynneBonta Or inexperience people making one mistake after another.
@NickWilson923 More healthy?  If it were a horse...well you know the rest.
@NickWilson923 Success in 1 business doesn‚Äôt automatically transfer to another. Know what you don‚Äôt know, hire someone who does. Stay in your lane. Him too
@BmJohnson323 Mine too.
@bmpbigdaddy09 They are. Very.
@JimWhite67 @crawfordbounce @barstoolsports My man jimmy!
@Big_TEX4 @crawfordblast34 My dude!!!!
@B_Rody1 It‚Äôs not your job to hit on him. It‚Äôs theirs. They missed. The beat goes on.
@eta44676 @JXDubya I‚Äôm waiting. For now.
@jrgioffre Thanks Joe!!
@MaryLynneBonta @NickWilson923 Some will say that‚Äôs already happened. The last two home games were among the worst pre mid season crowds they‚Äôve ever had.
@MrLarryLarry And still applies today!  That‚Äôs the beauty/horror of it. Clearly lost on you.
@jamescags24 @bryanpHury Can‚Äôt hear Triv where i live.
@cooltrav You‚Äôve missed the entire point. She is every bit as qualified as he is to make key nfl personnel decisions... not at all qualified.
@NickWilson923 At this point NO ONE without prior high level NFL front office success should be involved. Period!!!
@JXDubya See the receiving crew no qb has a chance. What have we really learned thru 6 losses?? No with no JT, we‚Äôll need 5 more QBs to end the yr.
@JXDubya We had the space last year. Mccorty is a hit. But Britt? Just this years dwayne bowe. Track record is horrible. Have lost all faith.
@JimmyBozz @_RonnieBass @espn Everyone‚Äôs trying to move the meter one way or another. I can count on one hand the number of people that I found unlikable in real life.
@JXDubya Ahhh
@BmJohnson323 I started at the right time, and definitely ended at the right time. Very Lucky to get the specific 14 yrs I did.
@SportsOhio7 I didn‚Äôt miss that part. Which front office did he visit that was loaded with high level executives with no previous NFL  front office exp?
@Tribe5886 He is a winner. Mets gain is our loss.
@JXDubya They didn‚Äôt need to hit on last years picks??? One bad draft can set back an organization 5 yrs. maybe more. 3 bad classes. Forget it.
@_RonnieBass @espn I know I did.
@SportsOhio7 Lol. Written by a Baseball guy nearly 2 years ago.
@JXDubya I understand. My point is the biggest part of ANY plan is the people in place to execute it. If they aren‚Äôt the RIGHT people, plan fails.
@JXDubya It‚Äôs only right if you hit on those picks. If your evaluators and scouts miss, obviously the plan isn‚Äôt executed, therefore, it‚Äôs flawed.
@m_schlesh @PardonMyTake @BarstoolBigCat @PFTCommenter Oh I wish.
@gwalkamoly Sadness. All the way around sadness.
@BrettMHancock No. This just shows both are broken that‚Äôs all.
@JaredKMueller Hope and 1 billion dollars buys a team. The hope part is optional and worthless.
@JXDubya Then, by the first measure of ‚Äúplan‚Äù it is an abject failure. The plan is right, the people hired to execute it are not. Come on man.
@kyyyyle Ok. Let me know how that works out.
@SportsOhio7 Yo, KD, this you??
@aross13 No one. Browns. Ride or die. Period. However, I can‚Äôt continue to support this mess. My fandom is on hold until I see corrective measures.
@bryanpHury Hearing the same thing. Money is a real issue. See salary cap.
@HHSReport Yes I do. Sad what its become. You guys to great work!  Keep it up.

@BMcBride20 @TaylorTwellman That‚Äôs my view too. Unreal. MLS can do nothing?
@TaylorTwellman What‚Äôs your take on this story? Also @BMcBride20 what‚Äôs going on here? This seems unthinkable to me!
@mjrill @DerekDeedok @Carraway1980 Of course. And fans suffer. Typical.
@DerekDeedok Soccer will always be in cbus. If he takes it and runs an expansion club will replace it.
@SkipSide Sounds like he wants a new downtown stadium, but doesn't want to pay for it. Threaten move 2 city he's apparently been eyeballing all along.

@Covertwo81 I'm convinced this is the beard account of a Browns front office employee.  Convinced.
@Covertwo81 Sixers have a title?? T'wolves? I missed those. Tanking is for losers!!! Period!!! Patriots tank much?  Steelers?  Winners!!! Culture!!!
@Covertwo81 That logic is completely losers mentality. The browns have tanked 4 years, where are they? There is no "lebron" coming out in the NFL draft
@VinceKutyIII @FanSidedFoS Overall though nice piece.
@VinceKutyIII @FanSidedFoS Barrett to finish it off to end his career with the title he couldn't help win in 2015. This season feels like 2015 in many ways.
@VinceKutyIII @FanSidedFoS Like 2015 when they lost out if confirmed game at home early, then caught fire. Barrett was injured, Cardale Jones led to title. Chance for
@VinceKutyIII @FanSidedFoS Careful with the exclamation points. Not needed. Also, Mike Weber not Webster. Edit carefully. Draw a conclusion. This season looking a lot
@themediashed @MarkAKunz It's hypnotizing. Lol
@VinceKutyIII @FanSidedFoS Would love to. Send a link.
@Covertwo81 No, it took Lebron coming back. That's what it took. He's not walking through the Berea doors anytime soon.
@Covertwo81 Oh, a 1 win then perhaps a no win season?  You can have that rebuild while everyone else laughs.
@TheTweetOfBuda Sure. Shoot!
@themediashed @MarkAKunz That's how this two-different colored eye, light-sensitive cat rolls. Lol
I said the same thing. In what scenario does this work? https://t.co/PpknXDY7dX
@Covertwo81 Lol. That's hilarious. Patience. We've got the bad part down pat.  No one is supposed to live at the bottom end of the talent cycle. #apathy
Thanks Mark! https://t.co/iF9NEQ7bw0
@BrianLenahan @owinewton Lol. Enjoy your young team that has all the other 31 teams laughing at their ineptitude.
@BrianLenahan @owinewton No. Hiring quality evaluators with proven success will do the trick. Blindly hiring newbies has not worked.
@Covertwo81 Of course they have to deny it. Just like the text to Watson. You can't own that.
@MikeALaheta @Browns Wait, 1-21 is not good?
@ohiobigdog1 People. He. Chose.
@TBSavage Apathy is the worst possible scenario. It has finally arrived.
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack Brick. Wall. No more talking to it. Out!
@ClevStrikesBack What if the tools and resources aren't adequate?  You think they are?
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack No where else to go. They've hit bottom. Rock. Bottom. Fans demand better. Deserve better. If you're good with this.... enjoy.
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack You want more of this? Have at it chief.
@ClevStrikesBack @bburch115 @Echo7Solo See steelers ownership for the model. That's why this is so tough.
@bburch115 @Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack True. Truce.
@Keith_A31 @Cleveland_Wins @AaronFromDover Oh, he didn't hire the coach?
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack You keep blinding supporting. Let me know how that works out. Peace
@bburch115 @Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack How many over the last 6?
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack Have the replacements?  Uh. No.
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack It's not working now.
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack I don't care about that regime. Long gone. And actually, yes, they were slightly better.
@Echo7Solo @ClevStrikesBack You like the last 6 years?? Just wondering.
@Nubetoriuos Not all
@Cleveland_Wins @AaronFromDover You think we had an a draft??  I'm watching the qb we passed on wipe up the field with the replacement to the qb we did pick.
@_JacobMilani @stanverrett Good call!!
@Nubetoriuos Respectable. Sure. Competent? Track record?
@richangelino lol. I actually don't blame the players.
Is that bad? https://t.co/22TZBCdYVj
@AaronFromDover lol. Nah. He picks the gm and coaches. Wake up
@mgbode_WFNY 6 increasingly more difficult to watch seasons.
@jbecks22 lol. I do!
@AndyFishman1 Lol!!
@joycereitz It's the draft. Plain and simple. Miss on too many guys. Too many guys we pass on are players. Weitz, Watson etc...
The second the browns enter the red zone the wheels fall off. Every week. Every qb.
Smiley spent a lifetime bring smiles to faces that needed them. After a long life with no sight, smiley can finally see. #RipSmiley https://t.co/QWNjotDHp8
Solid win by the astros. Solid.
Let's finish this off!!! #BGSUHomecoming https://t.co/L3F1bzt8zs

@bmac1818 @Pollyeyes That's what I got!!! Damn that's a lot of food.
@Official_AGmann Game.  Coin toss. Brathaus for sure.
@bmac1818 @Pollyeyes Wayyyy too much food!  I can't eat that big of a portion. Lol. But really good.
@ImThatGuyJG @Pollyeyes Yep
@lordviscera It's been terrific!
First ever @Pollyeyes experience going down!!! Let's see if they live up to the hype!
@VermaTyler @ShannonSharpe Thanks Ty
@alex_shoff Thanks Alex.
@TheGrimHEEP Thank you sir!
@B_HALL_24 @D_Br2 @wbgufm @4_T_W_ Looking forward to it.
@D_Br2 @wbgufm @4_T_W_ Done.
@MattFinkes That made me laugh. You gave  my dad one a great sports memory! I'm sure you remember the game and play! Hope you're well Matt!
@BobGlauber Thanks friend. Hope you're well!
@D_Br2 @wbgufm @4_T_W_ I once sat where you guys were sitting. When I'm back next month I'd LOVE to sit there again!! Lmk
@bkline97 Thanks Bob!
@claywsyx6 Hope you're well friend.
@johnjury11 Very true John!  Journey&gt;destination
@TarasU_13 @MrNickGerman Is there a belt with this title?? Lol. Thanks!
@Tmargs @funkinflash @Indians There you go. perspective.
@I_AM_RONIMAL It's all good üòä
@CoryG0uld Thanks Cory.

@atrain2309 Thanks Alex!
@katylanders Ty!
@DaddyCarlos21 Thanks Carlos.
@_SDunn_ Thanks Scott! We can talk soon about some little things with the app.
@John_Allen19 Would live to twin. But I'm at BGSU.
@danielleWTOL11 Thanks D! Nice job in CLE yesterday.
@MrNickGerman Great job Nick!!
@MaxLewton Thanks Max!
@1buckeyetom @Jwhitson9 @bgsu Thanks Tom
Had a great time! Thanks. https://t.co/QfPFVejw6s
@ShayneNissen Glad to have helped Shayne!
@Jwhitson9 Thanks Josh! I have no doubt I will.
Embrace the wins! Shrug off the losses! Know what is truly important. https://t.co/IivhccXYQj
@redjr30 Stay in this space long enough. It's commonplace. Sad. But human nature.
@tribesucks1 @BMitchell0121 In time Jedi. In time.
@Danimal1978 Wallow in self pity or misery if you wish. They clearly didn't play up to their ability. It happens. My life goes on. Yours should too.
@Jwhitson9 No longer my problem.
@BrownsLALAW This is the bottom line.
@_RonnieBass @Rider4Real Most ejections. "That was not a strike! The arc was illegal!!!" Throws bat and wipes off eye black dropping F-bombs everywhere.
@ljf1017 You're a wise man friend!!!
@BGan1725 Glad to help.  Now go embrace life!
@Nino_Morrison Just be respectful friend. It's free. It's easy. And it's just a better look. Enjoy your win. Watch those stros!
@ilovejessicadow Thanks Tim!
@Machine1885 Granted. But just 24!
@GoBuckeyes4Life @RonDonLaFlare Having lost my father before I could share that with him I understand the pain. Don't waste days with him being sad over a game!!!
@Nino_Morrison Enjoy the astros Nino!!!!
No Nick, it's how you deal with something that in reality changes very little in your life. You get paid last night? Ring?  Get 'em Cleeps.. https://t.co/GmP8kagJcS
You're a class act Daniel. I'll let Cleveland fans deal with you and say things I won't. Enjoy!!! https://t.co/Tz5nuosmh2
@RonDonLaFlare Of course it's natural. But it's a game. Fans get no rings. No money. No celebrity.  And really, how much does a title change your life?
@adidasjunkie350 @Skrubba05 I believe he meant we'll be part of the discussion for a long time. If he didn't, he's mistaken.
@Skrubba05 Neither is NY so there's that.
@Nino_Morrison Basically getting swept?? Is that like being basically unaware?
This is what I said after the Cubs loss last year and it still holds true today. It's a game. Season over. Life goes on!!! Live it!!! https://t.co/yc13LcNkFM
@Emily_Hannah09 This is what I said. It all remains the same!!! https://t.co/gKqAq4y2Lo
@DewhurstTodd Thank you Todd. Most kind!

@horner_shane I have wished that. I would just stop watching the NFL before that.
@Covertwo81 You're out of your mind. Diss? Truth. Sorry for your. Kind https://t.co/TsHUfzbl2E should demand better. Shame on you.
@knicks148 Dominated!  The rights to the number one.
