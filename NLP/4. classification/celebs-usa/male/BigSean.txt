Pay attention to your mental health, that’s a real important thing
Feeding your ego ain’t gon do nothing but leave you disappointed in the end. Feed your happiness, your purpose. Real wins
It was times in my life I thought I wasnt enough, or wasn’t worthy because I was comparing myself to my brothers or sisters success, instead of just being happy for them like I knew I should be. That’s that mufuckin EGO! That shit will get u in trouble
In my life I internalized how I felt way too much, one thing I learned is u gotta let that shit out soon as possible. It’s unhealthy not to say how ya feel

He claimed he had wrote songs for Michael Jackson, Jay Z n was wit Birdman etc. I'm hoping he's getting the proper treatment he needs.
the dude was released from a mental hospital last week, has a long record of mental illness n was off his meds. Very serious issues
some guy waited in line in the cold since 10am, bought my CD, when I signed his CD n shook his hand he TRIED to hit me off guard
Look I never comment on this type of shit but they can't do me dirty and say a fan smacked me or no shit like that.

One of the 1st female black officers in Detroit, a teacher/counselor, an amazing mom/grandma were too great for this song not to be a single
I hope my grandma is looking down smiling on me right now. Because the struggles she went through to become a female black captain in WW2,
Real to me be 1 of my singles n not just a album song. I promised myself only music from the heart from now on when I made this album...
know it's hard to imagine me not cursing on a song/single... (Cues up IDFWU, etc lol). But honestly I'm proud to have a song so heartfelt n
never had a song like this be a single, it's different then what's on radio, but I feel it's needed w/ all the craziness goin on right now..
