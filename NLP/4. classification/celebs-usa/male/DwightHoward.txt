@aredddd24 we had a dunk contest against each other before
@RezNBK lakers. The bigs is key
@JarrodRudolph me too
@aredddd24 Vince easy
@JarrodRudolph he was the truth
@JarrodRudolph agreed
@RGuedry18 it's Twitter not class
@ethomas5991 daenda
@Lauren_knight7 wingstop
@JarrodRudolph oh that's tuff now. Lol gotta go with the magic shaq
@JarrodRudolph what about the first game
@WCSportsMike Turk
@Gooooonzalez thank u
@LakersNationYT when did u ever hear me say that
@puebla34 try every year.
@ChefTalkSports it's old players not current
@puebla34 and what team was this
@kpatterson98 was talkin bout shooters
@LilMaccc they don't know basketball
@CrossCanseco I don't have any issues with him. Life is way to short to worry about petty stuff
Game on the line. Need a 3. Choices are Robert horry  Steve Kerr Reggie miller or Ray Allen.
@CrossCanseco lol yall believe everything Stephan a smith says. Where was this story two years ago.
@tylerwigfield who's blockin the skyhook
@JMKaram I know who they are. But that's my opinion. I'm entitled to it.
@Ace32387 Kobe shaq. Then I might have to do Lebron and dwade. It's a 2 on 2 game. Mj would be hard to beat
@Shameekia11 jus a trivia
@Rachel_Deneen it's 2 on 2
Who's the best left handed player ever.  I'm goin with James
@Shameekia11 lol I think him and shaq might win
Kobe and shaq vs Kareem and magic.   Second one dwade and Lebron vs mj and pippen
@JarrodRudolph 😴
@grisson123 I love Clyde. But that flash guy. He was the truth. And he still got it.
@poundVAMPLIFE it's really a hard decision. It's like u may want mickey ds and I want Burger King. It's an opinion
After Mj and Kobe who's the third best SG.
@poundVAMPLIFE have u seen Kareem play. Or wilt. They played a position that isn't sexy. Guards always look better so people (cont…
@poundVAMPLIFE …cont) gravitate that way
@joybenedict so for Kareem to play till 40 and dominate should make him
@noside12000 he won in Milwaukee also
@BrandonSchu13 that's be cuz he was all over the tube. And he was a great player.  I believe if people saw a… http://t.co/U9txSwmSRz
@z_kendall what's ur reason
@joybenedict who got the most points in nba history
@katalinafulop ok
@aredddd24 that's a hard one. Lol. #
@HereComesTurco he played against wilt and jerry west.
@TJ_HatesBitches hmmm than Kareem.
@joybenedict y
@Vanigga_Woods thank u
@joybenedict tip got wilt beat
@Vanigga_Woods yea. It was different then.  We don't need to fight.  We jus hoop.
@HereComesTurco no u can't discredit. 11 rings. Defense. Coaching.  Bill Russell was a beast. Jus played in a different era and (cont…
@HereComesTurco …cont) basketball wasn't that popular then
@Vanigga_Woods it's not fighting. It's a discussion. I jus wanted to hear people opinions.
@Pacs_1992 its old news now my g.  Focus on yall squad.
@Shewanna_Chief not to young but he still playin.  He right behind mj as far as game
@HereComesTurco winning 11 rings in any era is hard. Don't discredit him.  Nba championship in any era is hard
@Vanigga_Woods that has nothing to do with physicality.  Game was different then. And the rules were different. Y fight and lose money
@Kingg_Reyes who was the leading scorer
@HereComesTurco if if if.  He couldn't help when he was born. Nobody knows what would have happened
@Vanigga_Woods physical. The game gets more physical each era.
@HereComesTurco that's the dumbest thing I heard this week
@aredddd24 so y they always debate if this player is better
@BrandonSchu13 but I thought it was about rings
@bigmiggz_ lol
@CLF_423 what tweet would that be.
@Omar_Luciano1 I didn't but they don't talk about him for some reason.
@Kselfmade so did Kareem and Bill. Mj had the two best defenders on his team when he played
@bigmiggz_ it won't be another bill or Kareem
@Lionelx93 lol man yall tripping.
@3Horstman a team player lol. It's a team sport.
@ogpapash umm nah. Bruh say what u want these professionals.
@neilc252 there all nba players tho. It's the best of the best
@musicfan637 that's crazy lol. I think people jus sleep on him
@_usmanh_ no knock on mj but Kareem and bill came before him and there wasn't commercials and media surround… http://t.co/aphnOQLXdH
@neilc252 I don't think u can say that.  Do u know what bill went thru as a player and a man.
@xxThrash_15xx ok
@MichaelRGoldman great point
@GYounger30 I'm not knocking mj. But yall forgetting about what Kareem did.
@Kselfmade so are u saying there wasn't good players in Kareem and bill era
@SirFunktastic go look at what Kareem did in his career. Y wouldn't he be the goat.
@JROD813 I see u still on here hating. I hope u enjoying
@Dirk_Junior41 so what about bill he did all that
@TazHaider24 but he got 11 rings
@jakeswayze06 umm no.
So who is the real GOAT. Kareem Jordan or Bill Russell. Me and the fellas wanna know yall answer.

@DTMuzic not playin boss. It's not one of those games. It's more so like a all star game.
@DTMuzic hmmm Gladys nights
@DTMuzic hmmmm what side of town
@alexkoford not complaining. At all. I can and will be a better. But don't compare u shooting in a gym alone to what we do for a living
@__Cam21 I'm not trippin
@4GotUrScootrBro yessir
@alexkoford u also don't play in front of 20k people a night
@bmomba_ I agree. But it doesn't upset me.  Most time it's funny
@alexkoford so guys who shoot less than me don't practice either right.
@JakeMessner doesn't mean we don't practice or I don't.
@therealdanzel I'm jus talkin bro. Not upset. To blessed to be stressed
@alexkoford and u know I don't practice y. Be cuz someone on TV said it.
@bmomba_ not wasting time jus. They jus obviously don't understand which is fine I wouldn't expect someone who watches nba instead of playin
@megaleonardon too bad
@alexkoford but he is a champion. U are on the outside so u wouldn't know how none of this would feel be cuz u don't go thru what we do.
@megaleonardon I'm not gonna take back what I said. And if u were ever in that position u wouldn't either
@King23Lewis right
@alexkoford we always push for more.  That's y it's a mentality. U don't sit and lay in defeat. U get up and… http://t.co/gAod5Xo0YI
@alexkoford when did I settle.
@megaleonardon mind of a champion and champion.  And we are here be cuz we didn't allow people to define us.
@alexkoford ur getting champion and champion mentality twisted.
@OrgesV imma always work to win a championship. People think that it's so simple to do. U can play your heart out and still not win (cont…
@OrgesV …cont) a ring. Allen iverson tried so hard. It jus didn't happen. So did Karl and pat Ewing
@megaleonardon that's not always tru. But you wouldn't know be cuz u are on the outside looking in.
@alexkoford I don't have one yet. And it still doesn't determine who I am. It's alotta players who don't have rings. But guess what (cont…
@alexkoford …cont) they are still great
@alexkoford I don't recall u being in this convo. I think we all know who won.  But that doesn't stop me from reminding myself who i (cont…
@alexkoford …cont) am. Jus makes me work harder
@King23Lewis thanks
@megaleonardon I think we all can admit when we lose. Obviously u haven't played to realize what I said. Being a champion starts in (cont…
@megaleonardon …cont) ur own head.
@megaleonardon like I said u wouldn't understand be cuz u don't play.
@megaleonardon being a champion is a mind set. And it's obvious u don't have that be cuz u wouldn't comment the way u did
