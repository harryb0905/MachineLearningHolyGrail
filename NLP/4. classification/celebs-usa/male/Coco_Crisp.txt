I know there's none A's fans out there that root for me as well, thank you to. I can't wait for next season, so jealous of the playoff teams
Unfortunately the season is ending. I had a blast in Oakland and Want to thank all the A's faithful and the organization for their support.
Was hoping 2 see my boy @BWats0n play 2morrow but he's on the road. Guess I'll just enjoy some sites in NY n Get some rest durin the off day
Wow!!! what a catch, saved the game, took a HR n my 1000th hit away. Sucks big time! Tomorrow is a big game 2 even up the series. Sleep fast
Finally! feeling better today. I've been sick the past week or so with that runny nose, sore throat crap.

If you get a second chance, grab it with both hands. If it changes your life, let it. Kiss slowly. Forgive quickly. God never said life
regrets. So love the people who treat u right. Love the ones who don't just because you can. Believe everything happens for a reason.
Be the kind of man that when your feet hit the floor each morning the devil says "Oh Crap, he's up!" Life is too short to wake up with
