This redtabletalk on being a gay black man in America is a must see!!! One of the most candid &amp; revealing conversations I‚Äôve ever had thanks to jadapinkettsmith, @purpleforora &amp;‚Ä¶ https://t.co/tgN74U0s5D
@PablonceJ @RedTableTalk Thank you for watching. FYI I came out in my 20‚Äôs to friends &amp; coworkers, my mom &amp; family at 30, &amp; I first talked about it publicly in my 40‚Äôs. In those 30 plus years I‚Äôve been out, I dated black men, most of them were closeted or on the dl. Perhaps not your experience, but mine.
A must see episode of ‚Å¶@RedTableTalk‚Å© on being a black gay man in America. If you think gay is a sin, watch. Whatever you think, watch. I promise you will learn &amp; grow. ‚Å¶Thank you @jadapsmith‚Å© ‚Å¶@OfficialWillow‚Å© &amp; #adriennebanfield https://t.co/5cbBsCfDjz
