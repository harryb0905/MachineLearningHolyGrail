@SalVulcano That‚Äôs true. Would like to see game to expand to a 7 day format, in which each team plays every other team once a week.
@BruceRheins Yes - BUT - you have to react instinctively: train with the brain, but let the body make the plays.
@SalVulcano They also play on Thursday and Monday.
@mikefinger Treat it like another day at the office. Know your assignment and do the job.
Looking for this game to be a battle of wills. Who can impose their will on the other team? Who can come back from a setback? Coaches need to keep these guys razor sharp today.
@GlennF 2 rings.
@SalVulcano Don‚Äôt get ahead of yourself, kid. This is why the game is played on the field instead of on paper.
I‚Äôd like to see the QBs air it out early to help establish the run game. Defense is going to need to step it up and make sure they‚Äôve got the mental game on lock down.
Special teams are going to need to come up big here. Turnovers could play a huge role.
Both teams have a shot to win this thing but, in my opinion, it‚Äôs going to come down to who wants it more.
SUPER BOWL ANALYSIS: I think the key to the game today for both teams is going to be coming up with big plays at the right time.
People ask me if I miss playing football. Don‚Äôt miss the practices or the travel, but I always get a little nostalgic on Super Bowl Sunday. Nothing like playing for a championship. #9years2rings

Not a student of history but is it unusual for a sitting president to have private talks with the leader of a nation that attacked us, to say he believes that leader's denials about attacking us, and to confiscate all the notes of the meeting so nobody can know what was said?

Or am I missing something? I mean, yes, they're all lying, but I just haven't heard clarification or follow-through on this point.
Giuliani said that Trump's answer about Trump Tower Moscow covers until 11/16, and Trump said he wouldn't answer q's about his presidency. In other words, Giuliani's NOT saying those conversations didn't continue after he got elected, right? Nobody is making that point.

I know the answer is because "he's the president," but what's the point in reporting anything Trump says? Nothing he says is credible. His policy discussions are incoherent. He's not even entertaining anymore.
@ProfJackie That's funny, I was literally just thinking about that production the other day. Please tell him I said hello. Also, I was supposed to read Tess in high school but didn't so my ignorance is my own fault.
@ProfJackie @rexparker And I am utterly unschooled on all things Thomas Hardy, and pretty much everything else.
@ProfJackie @rexparker In the first half of Jude, though, he introduces us to basically only two women, both thoroughly unlikeable. The woman who he ends up falling in love with later is (in my opinion) much more of a sketch of a woman than an actual women, although I'm still only 1/2 through the book
@ProfJackie @rexparker Keep in mind that I'm going off having read about 1/3 of Jude the Obscure, and nothing else by Thomas Hardy. Further, part of the conceit of the podcast is that I'm commenting out loud as I read, so I readily admit I'm just kind of throwing shit out there...

@UsmanAlly I don't think I am in this case - Saudis putting a hit on an American national? Do you think they would do that without some belief Americans wouldn't respond or that their response would be minimal?
@sfrantzman @YawnDogg Perhaps that was misworded. Yes, it's been going on for a long time; the "starting" referred to nations who may have held back in the past because they understood their actions would likely have consequences. Now they understand their consequences will not.
@sfrantzman I don't think US can do everything, but we seem to be entering a situation in which we do nothing.
When the US starts telling the autocrats of the world, "We don't care what you do," it doesn't seem so surprising to me that they then start killing journalists, academics, lawyers, critics, etc.
@Amy_Siskind Can felons vote in New York?

@GlennF All I know is we‚Äôve come a long way from a guy who sometimes had 1 or 2 beers to the president saying he had a drinking problem - as everybody has noted, this matters because his credibility rests on him *never* behaving in the manner Dr. Ford described.
If the president acknowledges his Supreme Court nomine had a drinking problem and that nominee says he continues to drink, wouldn‚Äôt it be prudent to inquire what that nominee has done/ continues to do in order to deal with that drinking problem? Or is that just nuts?
Would be willing to bet they‚Äôre not from the future. https://t.co/3jgDQgVdIN
The only positive thing we can say about this coming week is that it's likely to better than next week.
@sukatra I‚Äôm not saying she should name the guy. I‚Äôm saying she‚Äôs doubting Dr. Ford‚Äôs memories so I think it‚Äôs fair to ask if she remembers the circumstances of her own assault.
Does Kellyanne Conway remember who sexually assaulted her? Would be interested for a journalist to follow up with that question.

To clarify: I‚Äôve had these talks with my son too but I happened to be driving my daughter around this morning.
@bradiscranky Yep.
I was trying to have this conversation with my 15 year old daughter today (not for the first time) but Erynn spells it out so much better than I did. I‚Äôm going to have my daughter read this thread. https://t.co/CsQxqC7MQm
@bradiscranky I‚Äôve known guys like that too and a lot of them, after being shitheads in their teens and early 20‚Äôs, turned out to be decent guys (and some didn‚Äôt). That‚Äôs not a conclusion about Kavanaugh either way.  Nor would it excuse what he did to Dr. Ford (and, again, I think he did).
@bradiscranky Agree on sociopaths and authoritarians. Trump is both.
@bradiscranky I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in any position to say what‚Äôs in anybody‚Äôs heart but I will definitely agree with you that his performance the other day was horrendous.
@LThacyk The chipmunk is free. The dryer was uninstalled and reinstalled. It‚Äôs a great day.
@bradiscranky I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to live mine. It‚Äôs really fucking hard for everybody.
@bradiscranky I‚Äôve been living in an almost nihilistic rage the last two years and I can‚Äôt keep doing it. I know there will be people who feel as though their whole lives have been spent that way; their rage is certainly justified. Everybody has to learn to live their own lives...
@bradiscranky The problem with this thinking (and you and I are probably mostly in agreement politically) is that it requires us to reject proponents of any competing philosophy as being ‚Äúless than‚Äù as people. I have been guilty of this and I can‚Äôt keep doing it because it‚Äôs eating me alive...
@bradiscranky The easiest thing would be to condemn everybody, to cast everybody out as demons, including those who believe, for example, Kavanigh‚Äôs denials or those in his political party. I don‚Äôt know where all of this leaves us. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm struggling with.
@bradiscranky That‚Äôs why all of this is so painful for me to wrestle with. What does it mean to hold yourself accountable for your actions? How do we do that for all men and women? Like, what should happen with Asia Argento, a victim and victimizer? I don‚Äôt know.
@bradiscranky We have, or should have, compassion for those who have done wrong *and* compassion for those who have been wronged. So how do we live with people who have escaped and accountability for their sins? How have they shown they have lived with their guilt? I dont know.
@bradiscranky A troubled and flawed human being. Do his victims see him as a demon? They very well might and I would never encourage them or any other victim how to feel or what to believe. To move forward collectively, however, I can‚Äôt simply cast out every person guilty of a crime.
@bradiscranky Are atrocious and I don‚Äôt think he should be on the Court. But, I also think he probably has done a lot of good in his life for his family and community. Is he a demon? I can‚Äôt get there because it separates him from the rest of us, creates a monster where I see...
@bradiscranky I totally hear you, and I agree with you about Trump. He‚Äôs a legit awful human being and always has been. But I don‚Äôt think I can draw the same conclusion about Kavanaugh. To be clear, I think he‚Äôs guilty of sexual assault, I think he lied about it. I think his politics...

@bradiscranky My worry is that the constant demonizing of our political opponents is killing us piece by piece.
@bradiscranky Agree. And I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù is the same as forgiveness. To me, it‚Äôs about living in the space *between* accounting and forgiveness. And I have no idea how we get there. To me, it‚Äôs the same conversation we have to have about race.
@richsuckass @BronzeHammer @adultblackmale I would 100% support Biden over this fucker and if you wouldn‚Äôt then I have no confidence in your ability to be a constructive force for the country.
@bradiscranky I agree but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs possible for truth to come out, in all of its ugliness, without a way to understand the reconciliation part. My sense is they work best hand in glove.
@Just_SomeChick Of *course* women should not only speak but shout the name of their abuser if that‚Äôs what they need. Always.
@bradiscranky Can you imagine listening in an active way that challenges you? Because the easiest thing for me would be to only listen to the angriest voices. I‚Äôm often an angry voice myself and I‚Äôm trying to figure out a better way. There is a way to work through all of this together.

@Gwenda @JBFletcher88 @kalenski Believing every moment of Dr. Ford's testimony and reserving *far more* empathy for her in this, and how that terrible night affected the rest of her life. All of that can be true, which was my only point.
@Gwenda @JBFletcher88 @kalenski I think his policies are *atrocious*. I think he should never sit on the Supreme Court. I *also* think there are people who love him and believe him and support him. I'm not one of those people, but it is possible to have empathy for him and them *while disbelieving him* AND...
@Gwenda @JBFletcher88 @kalenski Is to paint everybody in such stark terms that we cannot recognize each other. That really worries me because I don't see how we move forward together if every conflict requires staking out impermeable sides. Let me reiterate: I think Kavanuagh *did it*. I think he's a perjurer.
@Gwenda @JBFletcher88 @kalenski That's good advice, and I sometimes hit "send" before I think the wording of tweets through all the way. I'm struggling a lot with the way everybody (myself included) portrays everybody else. As we're both saying, none of us are demons/angels but the tendency online...
@jesseEturner I think first 100 people get a t-shirt.
The standard for a profile in courage now seems to be that you make a bad vote for the wrong reasons in order to appeal to the worst people.
@Gwenda @kalenski Because that ends up creating a caricature. The problem is, we can all be reduced to caricatures. Is he guilty? Fuck yes. But I can also recognize that other people in his life believe him to be a "good person."
@Gwenda @kalenski Both of those things can be true. His crime disqualifies him from serving, and may even subject him to criminal prosecution. But it doesn't erase his totality, which is why the issue, to me, is more nuanced than saying somebody is a monster...
@Gwenda @kalenski Those same people do "good" things. We aren't one thing or the other, even the worst among us. So I was just making the obvious point that we are all both. As far as I know, Kavanaugh has been a "good guy" for decades, but I believe he *did* what he's accused of doing...
@Gwenda @kalenski But I also think it's important to talk about "the good guy," as he's perceived by others and by himself because almost *everybody* (man and woman) believe themselves to be "good," so I struggle with that dichotomy. We *know* people do shitty things. We also know...
@Gwenda @kalenski That wasn't my conversation; it was one tweet in a daylong conversation.
@mrdavehill Can you back up a minute? 1-10, how much did he look like Steven Seagal?
@Gwenda @kalenski I think he's guilty as fuck, I think he lied, I think he's disqualified. I *also* think he can be a basketball coach and a good boss and whatever his friends believe about him. *My* feelings about him seemed obvious to me based on the fact I'd been railing against him all day.
@Gwenda @kalenski I often forget that people will interpret tweets in the worst possible way as opposed to the way it was intended. What I thought was obvious (people behave differently around different people, particularly over time) people interpreted to mean that *I* believe he's a good guy...
If they can erase a woman's memories so easily, they can certainly erase her rights. https://t.co/mvXF4TO5UO
@mkkraemer @moby_dickhead I 100% see the privilege. Had it been anybody else behaving like that yesterday they would've tased him. My point was simple, just as yours. The people in his life (and he himself) may believe he's a "helluva good guy"; that same guy may have done these things.
@mkkraemer @moby_dickhead My point was exactly your point. Read my timeline if you want to see my "fucking take away" from this.
Let's say what GOP is true and Feinstein leaked it when votes for Kavanaugh were clear. So what? At that point, they have to re-open the background investigation and the fact that they haven't tells us everything.

@asperschlager @moby_dickhead The term "helluva" was my quotes.
@moby_dickhead Because I can hold two thoughts in my head at the same time. I think Kavanaugh did it. I also think he's a perjurer. I also think he's disqualified. I also think he may be exactly the guy his character witnesses portray based on their interactions with him. .
@DanaSchwartzzz He didn't. If you read my timeline you'll see that I said that I think he's lying. I mean his can be a coach and a mentor and a great boss and everything that his character witnesses said and still be a guy who sexually assaulted women.
@ldrinkh20 @JenKirkman Yeah, that was my point.
@JenKirkman I just mean that his character witnesses may all be telling their truth about their experiences with him.
Seems like two things might be true: Kavanaugh might be a helluva good guy now and also that he did those things then.
All of these GOP senators apologizing to Judge Kavanaugh for what he‚Äôs been through. None of them apologized to Dr. Ford for what she‚Äôd been through. They wouldn‚Äôt even speak to her.
I don‚Äôt know how you draw any conclusion other than Kavanaugh is exactly who Dr. Ford described.
@andrewzimmern Me?
But, for real, what's the downside for them? They do the right thing, kick him to the curb, and end up with another nominee who will be just as shitty on policy minus the sexual assault charges. Win/win for GOP.
@Merrillmarkoe It's an excellent point.
@NaveedAJamali Yeah, but I feel like the media itself only refers to Collins and Murkowski; they seem to take for granted that GOP men will just vote for this dude.
I honestly don't understand why Republican male senators are getting a pass on this - it's just assumed all of them (except maybe Flake) will vote yes on Kavanaugh. Where are their voices?
Usually I give my 17 year old son a hug/kiss goodnight. Tonight I was on the couch with my laptop and instead of giving him a hug, I gave him a high five. He leaned down and hugged *me* instead, so now I might have to cry.

@Massawyrm I'm in.
@eshap More bat shit?
@AlanHunterMTV I didn't see any of that - only worked with him for a few days and he was a goddamned delight.
Worked with Burt Reynolds on a TV show once. He introduced himself by saying, "Hi, I'm Burt Reynolds. I used to be big in the 70's." How do you not love that?

As frustrating as it is to witness, I have to admit that I'm proud to see the Kavanaugh process is working as it was intended by our Founders, which is to keep me from doing anything productive with my day.
Cory Booker was right about Jeff Sessions, so at this point I'm going to trust that he's right about Brett Kavanaugh.
@SincereTruths Sure, go ahead and build me whatever you like. In the meantime, blocked.
@SincereTruths How do you say these things and then say "no offense"? Offense was intended. Why would you say it wasn't?
See you there!  https://t.co/UgpXcDPbZy https://t.co/tSipSlyLGF
Hi. Saw you're on Twitter just now. Just wanted to resend this thread in case you didn't see it. Would love to hear back. Thanks.

@Massawyrm I'm thinking of generals writing memoirs after disastrous wars, all of them blaming each other. Doesn't usually work but it makes the writer feel better.
@Massawyrm If that's true, it's cynical beyond all measure, which is certainly possible. At the moment, I'm choosing to believe it's just somebody (or somebodies) trying to salvage their future reputation.
I still don't understand how that op-ed is supposed to help anything. What is being served other than the writer's guilty conscience?
@MollyJongFast I desperately want this to be true.

@MrDonEden I support harrumphing.
I don't like when people on the news chuckle. Nothing is funny. No chuckling.
@DunkingBaby @aedison Ok.
@joshgondelman @mariskreizman Happy birthday!
@ben_geier So you voted for a war criminal. Got it. And when Barack Obama‚Äôs eulogized McCain, he was eulogizing a war criminal. You must think very little of Obama for doing so.
@ben_geier If you believe that, then you had no choice but to vote for Donald Trump. Was he your choice for president or did you just ‚Äúsit it out‚Äù? Was that the best option so you wouldn‚Äôt have to vote for a war criminal?
@ben_geier If that‚Äôs true, you‚Äôre going to have to indict a lot of people. If voting for war is itself a crime, you‚Äôre going to have to indict even more. I hated the Iraq War and continue to hate it. But I voted for Hillary Clinton to be president. Is she also a war criminal?
@TheTedAllen In Arlington, VA telling jokes.
@tropicalsoul Because, after two full days of this, I want to know if this is how she wants her fans to behave. If so, cool.
By the way, people who are reading this, I have no interest in anybody attacking Avery.
I don‚Äôt know anything about you other than you‚Äôre a comic. Your fan base obviously thinks highly of you - do you condone personal attacks on me based on my defending somebody I care about? I certainly didn‚Äôt attack you and didn‚Äôt insult you. Legit wondering if you‚Äôre cool w/it?
Explaining that you can disagree with me, you can disagree with her but coming after somebody I care about in a personal way is out of bounds. Wouldn‚Äôt you do the same for your friends? Don‚Äôt you have people in your life with whom you have deep disagreements but still love?
@aedison Hi Avery. For the last two days, my TL has been filled with people attacking me and my friend, and tagging you in the chain. So I‚Äôm asking sincerely; is that cool with you? You came at my friend in a personal way and I blocked you...
@edwardnelson4tn @robdelaney @NekoCase Thank you. I asked for respect for somebody I knew who died. That‚Äôs all.
@I_am_Roz I‚Äôm so sorry. Will reschedule ASAP.
@edwardnelson4tn @robdelaney @NekoCase I support Democrats.
@edwardnelson4tn @robdelaney @NekoCase Good luck in your race and thank you for your service.

@cunn1ng__stunt @MeghanMcCain Before I block you, I can tell you didn't read the book. It's filled with disagreements. In fact, that's the entire point. We disagree throughout and manage to do it without killing each other (although we came close a couple times).
@OLDHAMBERT Happy to help you out. Blocked.
If I were a senator on the Judiciary Committee, my first question to Brett Kavanaugh today would be, "I know a guy who has your last name but he spells it differently. Do you know him?" Then, no matter what he said, I'd say I didn't care and he wasn't getting my vote.
@cunn1ng__stunt @MeghanMcCain ...and?

@lmegordon @ancatdubh2 Don't worry - they won't be surpassed.
@McnallyKell Oh! I guess I'm a humanist minus about 80% of the optimism.
@estarianne Yeah, and you can actually have decent conversations with them.
@estarianne All I'm asking for is a little human decency. Disagree, sure, but I'm just asking for my followers to abstain from name-calling and personal attacks. That seems like a reasonable request?
@lmegordon @ancatdubh2 Hahaha. I picked it because it was sitting on my bookshelf and I liked the name. My wife had to read it during college; it had remained unread since.
@estarianne Arguments are fine - I don't care about arguments. I encourage them. It's the name-calling and attacks. I asked people not to attack, that's all. And I said "please!"
@lmegordon @ancatdubh2 Is he generally rated above them? (I've never heard of Gaskell.)
@McnallyKell I honestly don't know what humanism is, but I imagine it involves humans?
@estarianne Asking people not to attack somebody is rude?
@ancatdubh2 @lmegordon This one is going to get ugly. Actually, I have no idea how well-rated Thomas Hardy is or not. Moderately well-rated?
@sonofrpc Probably yes. Enjoy!

@whmullally You work for Al Arabiya, owned by a Saudi billionaire. Where are your comments about Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses? I don't say this to shame you or to put you on the spot, but only to point out that you're seeking the perfect in others, but not yourself.
@whmullally Yet you live in Dubai, a city built on slave labor and have never, that I can see after reading through your timeline, spoken up about that slave labor. https://t.co/uBsWxAdnd3
@whmullally So it's galling when we see politicians violate what we believe to be those tenets. We use our voices to speak out for marginalized people and speak up for them as we see fit. That's part of our responsibility. I assume you agree with that.
@whmullally Thanks for the keen observation, William. As liberals, I suspect you and I both believe in human rights and do what we can to support them, yeah? And so when we find violations of those human rights, we speak up about them. I mean that just seems like a tenet of our belief system
@Imyellinganyway @harveymalk @NekoCase @robdelaney Sure. I'll block you and then you won't have to deal with my takes. Happy to help.

@harveymalk @NekoCase @robdelaney Yes! It was his experience dipping into corruption that led him to become an anti-corruption crusader.
@NekoCase @squintables @HorridHenryVIII @robdelaney Yes, it's a lot of attention for one person. Too much for taste for sure, but not so much as to be offensive. It was important for reasons that extend beyond his life and into the current political culture. He thought, correctly, his death could inspire a moment of comity.
@smitallica @robdelaney @NekoCase Colossal, unmitigated fuck-up on his part.
@harveymalk @NekoCase @robdelaney I will defend good people who, over the course of a long career, did some fucked-up shit. Voted against MLK Day in Arizona? Fucked up. Voted to authorize force in Iraq? Fucked up. Supported campaign finance reform, immigration reform, saved Obamacare.
@handicrap89 @robdelaney @NekoCase He fucked up Trump's Obamacare repeal.
@HorridHenryVIII @NekoCase @squintables @robdelaney That's true, but it's because he understood the moment. That's not hagiography. He also invited rivals to speak for him, and they did. Even his friends pointed out his flaws.
@CariniGambarini @gdholtby @robdelaney @NekoCase He was definitely wrong a lot of the time.
@NekoCase @robdelaney Sure. Happy to read. Have a great flight.
@NekoCase @squintables @robdelaney I definitely agree with the disdain for hagiography, for him or anybody else. I think he did too.

@mizzzzzemilia My reasons for opening the dialogue about Louis were wrong-headed, as I have said, but actually came from a place of wanting to be supportive of women. I apologized for the comments and will do so again to you. I'm sorry.
@mizzzzzemilia As for who I champion, I don't want to promote or defend myself. I think my actions supporting female comedians speak for themselves - and you are free to interpret that any way you want. If you think the answer is I don't champion them, that's fine.
@mizzzzzemilia Sorry - I've been overwhelmed with people on my TL and am only seeing this now. The reason I didn't mention the women by name is because I thought they deserved to be disentangled from this story. To link their name with his only furthers a story they didn't ask to be a part of.
When we asked to switch to the fourth room, the hotel clerk put us into a hypoallergenic room for "sensitive guests." We're like, "We're not sensitive. There's literally a wifi network saying your hotel smells like shit."
I never ask to switch hotel rooms. Checked into a hotel 6 hours ago, now on 4th room. Room 1: Air-conditioning didn't work. Room 2: Air-conditioning didn't work.  Room 3: Smelled BAD, and somebody set up a wifi network called "[Name of hotel] smells like poo-poo." Room 4: ???

@nberlat Hi Noah. Do you have any way that I could contact the poster? (I mean, if she wishes to be contacted.)
@Astromarine @nberlat Sorry - I wasn't being flip just then. I'm legitimately sorry for your abuse and I would be happy to talk to you further about this if you need to.
@Astromarine @nberlat I'm sorry for your abuse. I'll see if the poster knows how to contact her.
@Astromarine Do you know her? Do you have a way for me to contact her?
@Astromarine Not sure what you mean when you say you don't want to engage with me since you engaged with me, but ok. I don't need your apology; I just genuinely don't understand where the word "coward" is coming from. Have a good one.
@Astromarine Coward? Can you explain that?
@shannoncoulter That's very well put.
@BunneeShelton No, I don't block people unless I have a very good reason - criticizing me isn't a good reason.
Hopefully he'll accompany this with another tax cut for the rich to really straighten out our finances. https://t.co/kYbiqxhYlE
@shannoncoulter And my questions only worsened that for you b/c I seemed so out of touch. Women feel like men will never hear them, and my comments seemed to confirm that. If I've got that wrong, please let me know.
@shannoncoulter That specific harm, I have the (for lack of a better word) privilege of being able to stand back and ask these lofty questions of "redemption" and "reconciliation." It's not about that for you - it's about genuine harm and pain...
@shannoncoulter I totally hear that. I'm going to try to echo it so I get it right: as somebody who was assaulted, you feel like you don't have the luxury of considering these questions in the abstract. To you, it's personal and visceral, but because I didn't suffer...
@BunneeShelton I didn't block anybody. I've been engaging with them.
@shannoncoulter So I became a guy who fucked up and I'm trying to do what I can to rectify it, including having conversations with people I upset.
@shannoncoulter At best premature, and at worst, actually painful to victims. I took that to heart. As has been pointed out, Louis will survive. I was trying to use his story as a stand-in for other stories of guys who fucked up bad. And, like I said, I did it in a clumsy way.
@shannoncoulter Yeah, I don't see it that way at all. To me, it looked like a really bad move on his part but as has been pointed out to me, I am often wrong. That being said, to me this was never about Louis. It was about reconciliation. And what I heard is that my questions were...
@shannoncoulter Thats fair - I was thinking of everything I'd been reading that didn't come from random Twitter accounts. People, like you, who are thoughtful and have a history of thinking about these issues.
@shannoncoulter I obviously can't answer for him, but I can say from an outsider's POV, it seems as if the condemnation against his returning to stage and the specific way he did it has been almost universally criticized.
@shannoncoulter I responded to you in good faith, and I am certainly willing to have a good faith conversation with you if you want. If not, be best.
@LeslieStreeter Thanks, Leslie. I really appreciate it.
@shannoncoulter He made his situation worse. If anything, the letter is now magnified. As for your "congratulations," I'm not asking for them and I don't need them. I needed to apologize because I was wrong.
@shannoncoulter But you did ask and I will answer: yes, I think he did. The question is what he did with that shame, and the answer is that he didn't do anything. In fact, he brought more on himself in the poor way he took the stage regardless of what the immediate audience did...
@alicewetterlund That's why we have these tools - to engage, debate, learn. I was wrong. Guess what? This messy bitch is often wrong. I'm sure I'll be wrong in the future and when I am, I'll cop to it. Good luck with your special.
@alicewetterlund That's the pleasure of pain of this site - we use it to communicate. I made a mistake the other day in trying to defend a position that was, as I said in a previous tweet, ultimately indefensible. I was wrong and apologized. But I don't apologize for using my voice on here...
@alicewetterlund Alice, you're certainly right that I'm a messy bitch. Have always been one and will almost certainly always be one. I suspect we're all messy in our way. I didn't think anybody was asking me to weigh in any more than anybody was asking you to weigh in on me...
@shannoncoulter I heard that and apologized because I think they're right and that, ultimately, I was acting like the person I am describing, somebody too willing to forgive.
@shannoncoulter By seeking a path forward for Louis and men like Louis, one way I erred was actually OVEResitmating, not underestimating our capacity for forgiveness. Women fear Louis will be too willingly forgiven and allowed to leave his misdeeds behind.
@shannoncoulter But what so many women told me is that men ARE routinely allowed to shed their sins and continue on as normal, while women are not. The reason so many people objected to my original point is that I hadn't considered this. That was my mistake, a mistake I fully admit.
@shannoncoulter It didn't originally occur to me that he would be "forgiven" in the sense that everything would return to the way it was for him. That didn't seem possible to me because, as I said, I envisioned him as always wearing the scarlet letter...
@shannoncoulter One of the main objections I heard is that women do not feel like that's true, that his behavior may be forgiven and forgotten, but that the victims will continue to be victims regardless. I hear it, understand it, and agree with it.
@shannoncoulter The comparison is that she was sentenced to a life of shame for breaking those norms, not whether or not the norms were just. Whatever happens with Louis, he will always carry the same letter. I wasn't asking whether he should or shouldn't, only acknowledging that he will.
@steeleman04 @kathygriffin Will consider cutting them off right after I block you.
@less_scrutable @JenKirkman 48 hours ago, I was raising the question about how do we have this next step in a painful conversation. What I heard from women is "Not now," and that it's not my question to ask. I respect it.
Thread from my friend @jenkirkman. https://t.co/QKjyVAd8N1
@mspricklefinger @phoebe_anne_ The problem was mine. I'm not saying anybody read anything wrong, but rather I didn't make the point well, and that, moreover, maybe it wasn't my point to make in the first place. I was wrong. As for mercy, we are all entitled to give it as we see fit, and to whom.
@LizArcury I hear you. Have a great night.
@NamirYedid @elle91 I hear you. Like I said, have a great night.
@LizArcury Yes, the metaphor is the same. In the case of the Scarlet A, it was her actions that earned her that letter. It wasn't an oopsy-daisy, either, but rather a deliberate breaking of taboos, actions for which she felt terrible shame. I think the metaphor is apt.
@NamirYedid @elle91 My initial stance operated from the premise that no human is disposable. You may disagree. We are a redemptive culture. We always have been. It's something I believe in. How do these men begin, and are we ever willing to let them back in? That was my q. Have a good one.
@NamirYedid @elle91 Thanks for checking in. I hope you feel heard and respected.
@NamirYedid @elle91 I think you are accusing me of presumption. That I know the answers to these questions. If you read what I wrote yesterday, you'll see that it'll filled with questions. And it's filled with people telling me their opinions. If you read my piece from later, you'll see the same.
@NamirYedid @elle91 I hear you, Namir. What is the listening you are doing? I ask that in all sincerity. What listening are you doing right now? Are you hearing anything I'm saying? Or are you too caught up in your indignation? If you are, that's fine. I understand.
@NamirYedid @elle91 But when I rub my own face in my own shit as apology and then you accuse me of stinking, what is the point? If the point is to point and laugh, so be it. I would hope you also have it within you to find a more helpful reaction - helpful for you, I mean.
@NamirYedid @elle91 Nobody is forcing them to do any work they do not wish to do, just as nobody is forcing me to anything, either. If we are here, together, it's my hope that we're here to bring what we have and learn from it. Sometimes, as in my case, what we bring might be shit...
@NamirYedid @elle91 Namir, I take your point and it's a valid one. Where else should I learn? What else is the point of communicating, publicly or privately, if not to engage with people and, hopefully, learn something? If people are here, in a public space, engaging with public people...
@elle91 Definitely trying.
@BetteMidler @JulietteLewis YOU'RE HIRED!
@phoebe_anne_ And it felt presumptuous of me to try. Thanks.
@phoebe_anne_ To me, those impulses were born out of empathy and mercy. I understand they were received as cluelessness, tone-deafness, and privilege. I hear that. I listened to what people had to say and apologized because I felt like I wasn't the person to ask these questions...
@phoebe_anne_ Then, I wanted to begin asking how we bring people out of the cold. I thought about the Scarlet Letter, a letter that affects people for life. Yet they still return, somehow, to work amongst their town. Can we have make space for some of our people who bear that shame?
@phoebe_anne_ I incorrectly assumed that people would understand I was not trying to relegate their suffering to some other, less important space, but trying to extricate them from this part of the conversation because their lives are already so burdened with this, I felt separation necessary.
@phoebe_anne_ I didn't recognize the pain asking the question would cause, didn't realize the fragility of the MeToo Movement, and didn't recognize that it would appear as one privileged white dude sticking up for another. My interest isn't with Louis. It's with, first and foremost, survivors.
@phoebe_anne_ Hi Phoebe. I hope I addressed this last night, but I will clarify. My intention was never to place the needs of the abuser over the victims, but rather to begin asking a question: is there a way to bring people back? I asked the question in good-faith, but perhaps naively...
I can tell you from personal experience, this point was brought home loud and clear to me yesterday. https://t.co/6VPUafNLGg
Has anybody seen Scooter Libby? https://t.co/amsmTTExsm
@kat_blaque I think this is a smart thing to say, and I understand it. I was conflating MeToo with a broader awareness of these issues. The mistake was mine.
Thread from the great Kathy Griffin. https://t.co/2G1CEnRK8n
@andizeisler Hi Andi, if I remember that exchange correctly, it ended with me saying I was wrong. I am often wrong. Have never said otherwise. I try to own my mistakes and apologize for them. Yesterday I made a mistake and apologized. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be the last time.
Isn't it the president's position that shit like this is fine? Looking forward to a statement of support from him. https://t.co/yhyFgWiYnw
@audreyalison Hi Audrey, if you read the rest of my timeline from yesterday, you'll see that I responded to women's comments to the best of my ability, acknowledging the faults in my thinking, and apologizing.
@maysoonzayid Not at all my intention to say that the abuser needs saving over the victims. If that's how it came across, I sincerely apologize. I was trying to find a way to begin asking the question of "what is the correct penance"? I unintentionally offended a lot of people, and I'm sorry.
@dorothyofisrael Hi Rebecca, I hear you. I hope I didn't mansplain, even in my flailing arguments yesterday. I think you're right that the path for victims is in believing and supporting women, and I'm doing my best to help even if I fuck up sometimes.
@chescaleigh I agree. That's why I'm reaching out to people and apologizing.
@chescaleigh Well, I definitely felt the anger and I think I absorbed what I needed to hear from it. Look - I'm a fuck-up in a lot of ways. Yesterday I fucked up, but I hope you know I fucked up with good intentions.
@chescaleigh Also, I understand that some people believe there should be no "forward," until women feel secure, heard, and supported. I get that, too.
@chescaleigh Franchesca, I'm seeing your tweets for the first time. I'm very sorry for what you went through and never meant to imply that it was anybody's job to rehabilitate Louis, only my hope there is, at some point, a way forward for men like him. I obviously made a mess of it. I'm sorry
@AnnaAkana Hi Anna, I hear you and totally understand this. Without rehashing the mess I made yesterday, let me just say I was trying to be helpful but was obviously the opposite. I‚Äôm very sorry.
@BillCorbett I agree with you. My point about the market was that, in the absence of a legal framework for guys like Louis, what else is there?
@amandadeibert I totally agree with this. ‚ÄúCaught up in‚Äù was a terrible choice of words and I apologize for that. I don‚Äôt think survivors are under any obligation to do anything. I‚Äôm sorry.
@thebobbieoliver @StaceyPrussman I‚Äôm very sorry. I should have been clearer. I meant that I think stand-up comedians in general got painted with a broad brush after Louis and Bill Cosby. I certainly didn‚Äôt mean to suggest there was no issue before 2017.
@PadmaLakshmi I‚Äôve spent the day unpacking my feelings on this and finally came to the conclusion that I was wrong and I apologize for being wrong. My heart intended something my head could not provide and I made a mess
@Bristy I think that's right. I am sorry. And I hope I did hear you today.
@_ElizabethMay Yes. I specifically didn't mention them because of an article I read from one of them in which she said she didn't want to be defined by his actions; I thought linking their names to his would be a disservice to them. If that was wrong, I apologize.
@mariayagoda I agree. I've been having private conversations all day with great women and made a couple donations and an apology.
@lindaholmes I think that's right and I apologize.
@mariayagoda I'm fine with being taken to task when I deserve it and I clearly deserve it today.
Dana's great and she has some wise thoughts. https://t.co/k0aGdT2ok4
@sabaahfolayan Sabaah, I've been reading your tweets to me. I hear you and I totally understand what you're saying. I apologize.
I'm making a donation to both right now. I think Talia did some great work today to make me defend a position that was, ultimately, not defensible. I understand that and, again, I apologize. https://t.co/nzx4nkODxq
@StephAllynne Hi Stephanie. I take it you don't mean "odd" in a good way, and I understand. I'm very sorry.
From somebody I admire and respect who DM'd me. She said I could post. I hear all of your voices and I'm really sorry to have upset so many of you. https://t.co/qOqhF9eDXM
@MrrBrr I definitely hear this.
@rgay @ElizabethSmthwk I agree. It was a poor choice of words.
Another view which takes me to task. Totally fine with this view and agree with much of it. https://t.co/8zEXpCQ8Oo
I totally agree with this, and I think it's impossible to know yet what personal changes (if any) he's undergone. The burden is on him. https://t.co/25pl1hxfmF
@MildlyAmused It's not about the abusers. It's about men in general.
Sorry if I haven't replied to any of you since this morning. I've been at work all day, and only got a chance to gather my thoughts in the last hour or so, which I wrote above.
I posted about Louis here: https://t.co/CTnw4YhtQ4
@_celia_bedelia_ Will read.
@JessicaValenti @chick_in_kiev I hear this. I don‚Äôt know how to answer; do I think that guy should be punished? Yes. Do I think there‚Äôs no way back for him? I don‚Äôt know. That is the issue for me. Is there a way back?
Happy birthday to Twitter Disney princess, @OhNoSheTwitnt!
@thecherness That might be true.
@Mel_Ankoly @cmclymer I‚Äôve never heard that.
@cmclymer I‚Äôm not at all familiar with the ‚Äúblacklist‚Äù allegation.
@cmclymer I actually agree with this. I think that was a shit move on his part.
@alcohollywood Because that is the human experience.
@hellocantera Agree.
@JessicaValenti @chick_in_kiev As for the message it sends to women, I think women will be the most important voice here: they will support him or not. If not, I am 100% on board. Personally, I can't imagine going to see him perform but nor do I think he should be unable to perform.
@JessicaValenti @chick_in_kiev I think it's terrible that they gave him a standing ovation. And I'm not welcoming his return. I'm saying I'm happy to see him try because I think it's important to figure out how we move forward.
@chick_in_kiev I'm not seeking absolution, Talia. Nor did I defend him. I'm trying to have a conversation about what I see as an important aspect of a much bigger problem.
The #metoo movement is incredibly powerful and important and vital. One next step, among many steps, has to be figuring out a way for the men who are caught up in it to find redemption.
My empathy isn't for Louis. It's for the recognition that we're in a cultural moment in which some men who do terrible things have no pathway for redemption. That lack of a pathway creates a situation in which we are casting people out but not giving them a way back in.  1/2 https://t.co/9o4U8TfniW
To those who think this is what I'm saying, please read my conversation with @chick_in_kiev. You'll see that's not at all what I'm saying. https://t.co/pQZInRyROt
@chick_in_kiev @lizclarkwessel @jonrosenberg That may be the end result. We just don't know. That's why I'm happy to see him try; he was among the first to be brought down and the way he moves forward will be instructive for all of us, for good or bad.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg You're right. It's impossible for me to reckon with anybody's pain. That's not for me to do. What *is* possible is for the culture as a whole to reckon with the damage somebody causes, and whether or not we can allow them back into the culture after they do so.
@chick_in_kiev @lizclarkwessel @jonrosenberg Poor wording on my part, but I do think it's important to take a broader view of this because it's not enough to identify a problem. We also have to figure out solutions. Is it permanent exile? It might be, but I don't think we've figure it out.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg It's really not about him at all. It's about a larger cultural issue and trying to see nuance in a difficult and painful atmosphere. And yes, the difficulty and pain lies primarily with the victims. But it's also with our ability or inability to reckon with these men.
@lizclarkwessel @chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg I'm not. But nor am I saying his life doesn't matter.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg I hardly think I'm "rushing" to take him back. I'm saying there has to be a way for men to come back. All cases will be different. All people are different. But I'm unwilling to say there is never a way back for people. I just don't know what it is. I don't think anybody does.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg It's not fair to say he hasn't paid any penance, because none of us know what he's been doing.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg When I say I'm "happy to see him try," I'm happy to see him emerge from self-exile and see if he can recover. To me, part of being a better man is seeking redemption. He's not going to get it at a single set at the Comedy Cellar, but he may in time.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg Public opinion may always be against him, in which case fine. Public opinion may be more forgiving, in which case fine. Nobody's giving him anything here, other than 15 minutes at his home club. If the outrage is sufficient, he won't be welcome there. Fine.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg 100% agree. Fucked up as hell. I'm not defending him in any way, shape, or form. What I'm saying is we're in uncharted territory in which somebody is not legally charged with anything, and so the only system to adjudicate is public opinion.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg But what else can he do? Are we going to say he should remain in permanent self-exile? That may be what some people want, but there's no system for adjudicating this other than public opinion.
@chick_in_kiev @jonrosenberg Agree that his power and cultural capital suppressed it. But I don't think it's true that he "continued to assault" colleagues. He wasn't Bill Cosby. But I definitely understand and appreciate the outrage. What he did may be unforgivable; if it is, his audience will let him know.
@dprimerib Well, I'm not out here saying Bill O'Reilly shouldn't have whatever stupid podcast he has.
@chick_in_kiev Because then somebody would be paying him. Here he is relying on a direct payment system where the market of the audience is reacting in real time to him. Either they will accept him or they won't. It's entirely up to them. Trial by fire.
@chick_in_kiev I think what happened with Louis has permanently changed the dynamics in the comedy community. It's also a misnomer to that sexual assault was endemic before. It wasn't. Sexism was, and IS, but that is changing, too. I don't know. It would be different to me if he got a TV show.
@chick_in_kiev I think you mean that if Louis is "allowed" to return to stage, women will feel like male comics will feel freer to assault them because they feel like the consequences are minimal. You might have a point.
That would have been your right. I'm sure they would have refunded your money. I'll just make the point that, unlike other careers, when he does stand-up, Louis works for the audience. They will determine if he's welcome or not. And the answer may very well be that he's not. https://t.co/5x7XlL9crC
@happystash He didn't get his job back. He performed a 15 minute set for free. He works for the audience, and they'll decide if they want him back or not.
I expect a lot of this, so I will say only that I'm not going to defend what he did or what he lost or what his punishment "ought to be." I'm only saying that we're in uncharted waters and we need to figure out how to move forward. https://t.co/HWo8DjqxVo
Will take heat for this, but people have to be allowed to serve their time and move on with their lives. I don't know if it's been long enough, or his career will recover, or if people will have him back, but I'm happy to see him try. https://t.co/QmqdGJnIjy
@KristerJohnson Even if he doesn‚Äôt know, why isn‚Äôt he at least calling for the killer to be brought to justice?

Yeah, I think this must be true. My point is that the way these groups of soldiers *portray* themselves is vastly different, not necessarily reflective of how they feel about each other. https://t.co/PykljHC17g
@AntiquesDuo True, but the trend goes back to before draft was repealed.
I don't use the term "toxic masculinity," and you may be right about this specific photo. But if you look at group photos of GIs going back to WWI, you'll notice a tapering off of touching and physical intimacy. (Obviously there are exceptions.) https://t.co/M8igaWy7Fm
I'm not making a judgment on either photo, just noticing that 19th century American soldiers expressed tenderness towards each other in a way 21st century ones do not - or at least they do so very differently. https://t.co/2k1D2JuNCd
I think it's indicative of larger societal changes involving men and masculinity that occurred between then and now. https://t.co/bD9GF2hU9J

The difference is that Catholicism is hierarchical in a way that no other major religion is. There's no Islamic pope, no Jewish pope, no Buddhist pope.

@islero47 Studios, because of the expense of making/marketing movies, has to appeal to broadest possible audience. That‚Äôs why today‚Äôs movies are so conservative (and bad).
@islero47 The reason TV is so good right now is that it‚Äôs picking apart these ideas and reformulating and upending them. Experimental, complicated, nuanced. Outside Hollywood‚Äôs conservative nature. Because channels are more niche, they can afford to experiment.
@islero47 Most mainstream movies, by their nature, are socially conservative in their themes: good guy vs. bad guy, hero wins, America is the land of the free, home of the brave, etc. Men are strong and true, women stand by them. This is H‚ÄôWood formula. Predictable and boring.
@islero47 Clint Eastwood remains one of the most popular directors: much of his work is the kind of conservatism I think you mean. His last movie, about the soldiers who stopped a terrorist attack on a train, didn‚Äôt do well.
@islero47 If I understand you correctly, you just want *more* of these movies. That‚Äôs fine. But I would argue if you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù movies, there are an abundance. In fact, I would argue the entire Marvel universe is, first and foremost, about American patriotism.
@islero47 You‚Äôre talking out of both sides of your mouth: on the one hand you‚Äôre saying Hollywood doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúconservative‚Äù movies. On the other, you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúconservative‚Äù movies make money hand over fist.
@islero47 Although I agree with you that Hollywood, in general, is left-leaning, they will happily take anybody's money who will hand it over. That's capitalism. If "conservative" movies suddenly become as popular as superhero ones, they'll all make them.
@islero47 Like any company, "Hollywood" exists to make money. 20th Century Fox is making shitloads of money off conservatives. It's called Fox News. Plenty of cons go to movies. If you mean fringe right movies, people make those, too. Steve Bannon has a new one. D'nesh just made one.
@TheSteveHolland I hear you and agree with you, but Jesus didn't say shit about homosexuality. Didn't say shit about celibacy. Didn't say shit about patriarchy. When I say the faith is gorgeous, I mean love, sacrifice, social justice.
@islero47 It really doesn't. It acts the way it is: as disparate companies in constant competition with each other. It can certainly be self-serving and insular, but it's not institutional in the way that schools and churches are.
@islero47 Agree that public education needs to be radically reformed. "Hollywood" isn't an institution; it's a business sector. Whoever commits crimes within it should be punished.
The Catholic Church should tear itself down, brick by brick, and rebuild. The faith is gorgeous, but the institution is rotten to its foundation.

@Iowan4rights You pointed to a bill co-sponsored by many democrats in 2015 so this is obviously untrue. Dems have repeatedly fought to reinstitute the Assault Weapons Ban.  This ludicrous statement conflates jokes with political positions. But you keep on keepin' on.
@Iowan4rights 1. Doubt it. 2. If you did, then you were ignorant about the Democratic platform.  3. He didn't; even if the bill had passed, it was never held to be unconstitutional. 4. You might be right about the story; I don't know.
@Iowan4rights Democrats tried to revive this bill, an effort which failed, yet somehow you voted for Obama TWICE and blame him for "taking away your rights" when he did no such thing? Somehow, I doubt you're being truthful about who you or your objectives.
@Iowan4rights So you, a Democrat, supported Democratic policies such as the Assault Weapons Ban, in place from 1994 until it expired under W. in 2004. Between 2003-2008, Democrats tried to revive that bill. You, a Democrat, apparently supported them. Then, when Obama was elected...
@Iowan4rights What gun ban was that?

@espiers I agree it's not onerous (and you are obviously far better informed about this stuff than I) but it seems like with everything on a quarterly system, public companies are always chasing that sugar high of quarter over quarter earnings at the expense of strategic long-term growth.
@MsAllesandrine My opinions about education haven't changed. I think the system needs a radical overhaul - that belief has nothing to do with the commitment and passion teachers bring to their work. It is the nature of the work itself and the structure underneath it.
@espiers Better for long-term investors, worse for day traders.
@espiers This seems like a good idea to me - even a slightly longer reporting time for public companies would allow them to focus more on strategic goals instead of daily market gyrations. No?
We lost Aretha, but we still have Lana Del Rey.

@andylassner @AndyRichter Guys, it's also my wife's birthday. She old.
@alinebmckenna @Racheldoesstuff @NiaVardalos @pattonoswalt I AM TECH AVAIL AND WANT TO PLAY A RAPPING GUIDANCE COUNSELOR THANK YOU!
My daughter got a math award. On one hand, I'm very proud of her. On the other hand, now I have to figure out who her father is.
@annetdonahue @vornietom If you talk to him, can you ask him to weigh in on my lips, which are, in my opinion, HIGHLY supple.
@andylassner @AndyRichter That was my second guess.
@andylassner Trump, right? Probably Trump.
@andylassner Who are you talking about?
@Caissie @HeatherWhaley @BusyPhilipps I'm a shitbag, but thanks.
@Caissie @HeatherWhaley I think this will be great. Strong agree with Heather. Congrats to you and @BusyPhilipps
@mull8193 A commie?
Started reading a long article about Kellyanne and George Conway. About halfway through I realized I don't give a shit about either of them.
@BusyPhilipps If you make an equally annoying noise with your mouth, the two sounds will cancel each other out.
I have mixed feelings about social media companies banning people, even odious people. On the one hand, I think it stifles free expression. On the other hand, fuck those fucking Nazis.
Update: a few days ago, I told you that Jeff Daniels was on my flight. Sad to report that Jeff Daniels is not on my returning flight. Hug your kids.
@aparnapkin @maevehiggins As an aside, I also like cake.

@brendonwalsh No!!!
@PardesSeleh No doubt you feel attacked, and that sucks. Consider the reasons for people‚Äôs anger. Maybe you think it‚Äôs unjustified. If so, keep on truckin‚Äô. But maybe you can understand why people worry about your boss‚Äôs message.

@AmericanRonin79 First, thanks. Second, conservatives are not being kicked off the service. Those who violate the Terms of Service are (belatedly) being kicked off. If I threatened to kill somebody (for example) the same would happen to me.
@AmericanRonin79 Nobody's being oppressed. Twitter can do whatever the fuck they want.
@steeleman04 This is dumb. Soldiers at war are different than peacetime citizens assaulting each other.

I mean, I acknowledge I'm a legitimate idiot, but this idiot can't see how "strategic satellite warfare" doesn't turn into generalized earthy warfare.
Or consider the advantage one side would have if they can see the battlefield but you can't? What do you do? Seems like you'd have to go on the offense before you lose your vision, right?
If you've got an array of ICBMs which depend on satellite guidance, and that satellite guidance is about go down, what do you do? You're in a use 'em or lose 'em situation.
@ditzkoff C'mon, man. Don't joke about Space Force.
To me, "strategic satellite warfare" sounds a lot like "launch our earth-based shit while we can still can." https://t.co/BXhZtMkIGt
Treaties? We don't need your steenking treaties. https://t.co/rfdDLP8j61
Some Thursday thoughts: 1. I like the name Space Force because it's so goofy.  2. Weaponizing space means we're going to have a space arms race. The most likely outcome of that is war sometime in the next couple decades, probably with China. 3. We're so fucked.

@jamesdiscourse Again, you haven‚Äôt provided any false information in the article.
@jamesdiscourse https://t.co/XklJ8H31pH
@SteveHuff Ugh - ditto.
@jamesdiscourse That doesn't my question. If you view of reality is skewed, there must be something false in the article about which I'm mistaken. What is it?
@screamingzen Thank you! I implore you to tell the world!
I would refer you to this Gavin McInnes interview with his friend, white supremacist Jason Kessler, which begins by Gavin saying he should project images of kiddie porn behind Jason.  https://t.co/GhyHWOA8ug https://t.co/PL1I3oxGjQ
@jamesdiscourse What's false in it?
Note: this article is from about a year ago, and involved Gavin saying he is going "mainstream" with a big media company. That obviously didn't happen.

@scalzi @HarlanCoben If he goes on an international trip, he's a Harlan globetrotter.
@HarlanCoben I am stating unequivocally that Myron is an excellent, unexpected name for an action hero. Certainly better than, I don't know, "Harlan," which sounds like some 80's villain.
@brendonwalsh I know you wouldn't want him to, but that doesn't really help - I mean, he lives with his mom and she's very permissive. I just think it's a bad idea.
For God's sake, who else has an action hero named Myron? I love these books! https://t.co/DF1VhIs5zA

@dynneson_kasey He has also made plenty of anti-Muslim statements, which are not "racist," but are bigoted. His anti-woman statements are also just heinous.
@dynneson_kasey Crooning to a room full of white supremacists giving sieg heils is also pretty good evidence.
@dynneson_kasey The entire Leslie Jones incident, which Milo promoted and encouraged, was blatantly racist.

@rob_sheridan STRONGLY AGREE
You keep making the same specious argument. It didn't work when you said he cannot be a racist (sorry, "Western chauvinist," as you say) because he married a black guy, and it doesn't work now. It's a dumb argument. And yes, white supremacy *is* a threat: his, yours, anyone's. https://t.co/MbFdApOwEh
Proud boy, I am only refuting the specific argument that you made, which is that a white person in a relationship with a black person cannot be a racist. It's an asinine argument.  https://t.co/86PrtZqNdy https://t.co/rQtf4JdkNJ
Strom Thurmond never raped anybody:  "'They were in love, clearly in love,' said [his daughter] Essie May."   Just like the loving relationship you describe between Milo and his husband. Yet Strom Thurmond was clearly a racist. How is that possible???   https://t.co/CHpHQBmBCW https://t.co/EH0OvPySJv
Proud boy, your argument began with "Milo is literally sucking a black man's dick right now," so it seems like you're the one fixated on the banging. Nope. He's a racist. (Oh, sorry, I know you prefer the term "Western chauvinist.") https://t.co/C1JQM9Ci09
What I‚Äôm saying is, you‚Äôre making a really dumb argument.

When there is violence or incitement to violence, it should be condemned. Whether on college campuses or anywhere else. That is why people are so frustrated with this president. He and his spokespeople tacitly endorse threats to the press and to those who oppose him. https://t.co/DFmzIlBnKF
@FieldOBears I'm not sure I've ever spoken one way or the other about antifa, but I have spoken very clearly about my opposition to violence. I condemn whoever commits it, whether antifa or college protestors or anybody else.
@FieldOBears Really? Which communist terrorists do I support?
As a conservative, do you consider the white supremacist Milo Yiannopoulos one of your brethren? What about Richard Spencer? Gavin McInnes, who traffics in racism and anti-Semitism - do you consider him a conservative? All of them were protested. Is that cool or nah? https://t.co/Z1xlduzqqA

@plagueoflegions I'm not sure how, but if you feel a lack of empathy on my part, I certainly apologize.
@plagueoflegions You're right, I haven't. Not because I think it's a good tweet but in the interest of transparency. People can scroll my entire timeline to see the entirety of my content; some is good, some is not. This one was not. So be it.
@lilmisslisajean @dloesh Lisa, what do you know about my personal life? I'm a comedian. I make jokes for a living. Sometimes those jokes are off-base, and when they cross a line for somebody, I apologize. I will do that now: if my jokes upset you, I apologize.
@tigerhawk33 @DLoesch She's the spokesperson for the NRA; she has written to me several times in the past and we have engaged in dialogue. Seems like the natural person to ask about illegal Russian money washed through her terrorist organization.
@Mickey51502 I think you're right. I have spoken with some survivors who don't mind these jokes and some who do. But I agree that if my kids were victimized I wouldn't be so cavalier, and I'm sorry if any of my jokes upset you.

@lerias1968 I own up to making some off-color jokes. I own that. It's why they're still up there after all these years. And if somebody is hurt by them, I really am sorry. My intention is never to hurt people, particularly people who have suffered. Have a good one.
@lerias1968 I think a lot of them are distasteful and I wouldn't make them again. On the other hand, a few of the ones flagged I still found funny. Comedy, right? The point is, I do not consider myself the moral police. I say what I think is right and when I err I try to own up to it...
@lerias1968 I made jokes about a topic people find distasteful. They aren't threats to anybody, they don't name people, they don't make claims. They're jokes. There is no action associated with those jokes. They live and (mostly die) on their own. When I look at them now...
@lerias1968 They kill gun control legislation to support their terroristic rhetoric, people die, which enhances terror, rinse and repeat. So I'm looking at their actions to draw my conclusion. I assert this is who they are because they fit the definition...
@lerias1968 I think this is a good point. I really do. And one I've been thinking about. I didn't come the conclusion that the NRA is a terrorist organization lightly. They systematically use terroristic rhetoric to achieve a political/financial end. Those are words put into actions...

@sdotglass @jennajameson She might not. My point was only that we shouldn‚Äôt make assumptions about people‚Äôs private lives based on their public performances. That seemed obvious to me, and I thought she would understand. Have a good one.
@sdotglass @jennajameson You might be right; my intention wasn‚Äôt to shame. I thought she was in a unique position to understand the point given her past work.
@sdotglass @jennajameson I didn‚Äôt shame her at all. Nor would I. I made the obvious point that public performance as an entertainer shouldn‚Äôt be confused with private conduct.

"Have to pay dues"? Friend, the 2A is there whether you give your money to noted organization the NRA or not. The NRA isn't there to "protect" anything other than profits. As for my being a terrorist, I did spook my dog last night when I unexpectedly opened the front door. https://t.co/r2IJkL9azw
@C4Note I never said they "serve" Russia. I said they took tens of millions of dollars in illegal Russian money. It's not my assertion; I'm using news reports.

@scottEweinberg Yeah. They‚Äôre feeling themselves. Unfortunately for them I don‚Äôt have a career to ruin.
@CJKFlyer I confess sometimes it was coach.
So be it, fuckers. I know what I‚Äôve done in my life. And I know what you‚Äôve done in yours. The NRA is a terrorist organization culpable in tens if not hundreds of thousands of American deaths. You want to shit on me for some bad jokes. Have at it. My hands are clean.
I don‚Äôt even think I know your mom. I make jokes about playing in the NFL. Guess what? I never played in the NFL. I could go on. The point is, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that the week I go hard after the NRA for being a mob front for Russia, I get this coordinated attack.
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs true: 1. I make offensive jokes. I‚Äôve been doing it for 30 years and although I‚Äôve slowed down in recent years and gotten more reflective about it, I still do it. Like when I say I do butt stuff with your mom. I don‚Äôt *really* do butt stuff with your mom.
Today, right wing Twitter came after me out of the blue (again) because they took offense to a bunch of jokes I‚Äôve made over the years (again). Why now? I suspect it has something to do with me asking @dloesh all week about Russian money-laundering at the NRA, but can‚Äôt prove it.
@LiberalsRSick Again, I‚Äôm flattered, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got strong, beefy hands, but I‚Äôm a married man.
@LiberalsRSick You‚Äôre making a pass at me? Flattered but I‚Äôm married.
@CassandraRules I have over 80k tweets, but I actually agree with you. It's not a funny topic, but I made jokes about it; I've made lots of terrible jokes.
@CassandraRules @MikeyK70 Agreed. We all should do the same.
@CassandraRules @MikeyK70 A ‚Äúpurge‚Äù would include killing children. Regardless, what you‚Äôre saying is *you* have a line. That‚Äôs fine. We all have lines in our speech, but there‚Äôs a massive difference between making an off-color joke and accusing that person of a crime, no?
@CassandraRules An ‚Äúannual purge‚Äù would imply a mass killing, no? Isn‚Äôt that insensitive to those who survived mass killings? My point is obviously that you‚Äôre splitting hairs about what‚Äôs fair game for jokes and what isn‚Äôt.
@CassandraRules Why not?
@CassandraRules By the way, I‚Äôm sorry about your best friend - that‚Äôs truly awful.
@CassandraRules I‚Äôm not sure I follow this logic. You yourself said you make a lot of murder jokes. I know people who were murdered. Does it follow that you shouldn‚Äôt make jokes about murder?
@Guinz I think, on advice of counsel, she has been quiet on this subject?

@thejoelstein THIS WAS A TRIUMPH FOR ME!!!
Some play it safe. But some go as far as they can. Those are the comedians I always admired. Richard Pryor, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, etc. If they had Twitter, do you think they'd face backlash? Of course. And I know what they'd say - fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
And I understand why sometimes, corporate entities feel obligated to sever ties with people over jokes, like in the case of Roseanne. And I understand why a company might hesitate for me to be a pitchman for some product. Every comedian has to wrestle with how far they want to go
Sometimes those jokes work, sometimes not. Comics often push the line because either we're trying to make a larger point or, as is often the case, just trying to get a rise out of people. I have always believed nothing is off limits, but I understand why some people disagree.
I think this is a good question. Here's the answer: I don't know. When is it funny to joke about Nazis, cancer, gun violence, suicide, drug abuse, cutting, car accidents, deeply held religious beliefs, sexuality, bestiality, etc. But comedians joke about all that stuff and more. https://t.co/N4KgSHU3so

@StoppingBadPpl @DHSBlueCampaign Just curious, what would be the charge?
@IgG1purifier He pled to a lesser charge.
@dougkowalski That sounds like a threat?
@Dotte_Boy78 @therealroseanne Of course not. We say things, people react how they‚Äôre going to react. But what Cernovich does is take people‚Äôs jokes and attempt to weaponize them. He‚Äôs been incredibly successful at it despite his lack of credibility due to an actual rape charge and pushing Pizzagate.
But this isn‚Äôt true at all. The primary source of gun violence in the US is white dudes shooting themselves in the head. Suicide leads gun deaths; most of those are white men. https://t.co/5jXWRiPxur
@davidegreenwald Thanks but I don‚Äôt need it. There‚Äôs nothing to defend.
@Erik_Kenney I don‚Äôt even understand why that was included.
@lizicobb Yeah, I didn‚Äôt understand why that was included.
@4one2nd Check the date - it‚Äôs been up a long time.
Anyway, have a blessed day. I will apologize for making bad jokes. Did you apologize to the girl you raped?
Mike, you sell ‚Äúbrain pills.‚Äù
Or this gem: ‚Äú(((Echo))) exists because people got tired of seeing, ‚ÄòWE WHITE PEOPLE are evil and oppress blacks‚Äô. Speak as Jews, not whites.‚Äù
Sorry, I said you are a racist without providing evidence: ‚ÄúNot being a slut is the only proven way to avoid AIDS. If you love Black women, slut shame them.‚Äù   ‚ÄúToday we have a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin‚Äôs rape victims. Kidding! He got got before he was able to rape‚Äù
Moreover, you are an overt racist and conspiracy theorist who pushed Pizzagate and have repeatedly smeared people, baselessly accusing them of, primarily, pedophilia. Yet you endorsed an ACTUAL pedophile, Roy Moore, for Senate.
‚ÄúRape via alpha male is different from other forms of rape.‚Äù These are your words, Mike, and you consider yourself an ‚Äúalpha male.‚Äù So when you were actually charged with rape in 2003, how was that ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù from a regular rape?
As somebody who has in the past made jokes about a whole host of topics, including molestation, I have never denied the horrors of it whereas you, actually charged with rape in 2003, have denied whether ‚Äúdate rape is possible‚Äù?
Wow. This is quite a comedown from James Gunn. Mike, we‚Äôve had this conversation before. There‚Äôs a qualitative difference between a comedian making jokes - even offensive jokes (me)- and somebody being charged with rape in 2003 (you). https://t.co/b5U7ITKkU7
@elle91 If only somebody would put them on double secret probation.

No, because terrorism requires the inclusion of terroristic rhetoric, which the NRA regularly uses to drive up gun sales and everyday gun violence, as well as less frequent terroristic violence. Thx. https://t.co/MYljZY6ywu
It's a great question - how many people have cigarette companies killed? None of them injected lung cancer into their victims, yet all of them are culpable in those deaths through their products, lies and lobbying. The NRA lies and lobbies for the gun industry. https://t.co/Y1ZswLuJZL

Setting aside the dubious assertion that most Americans "don't care," that's not really the issue. The central questions now are whether an American president: 1. Broke the law 2. Is beholden to another nation. 3. Does pee-pee stuff. (#3 is not central, but I want to know.) https://t.co/d6JoMsxSKw
@_mikegalt_ Could be - I promised them 42 but I have no idea. I think it might end up being right around there, but I haven't done any actual calculations.

@MJMcKean Seemed to me like a very careful interview on both sides.
A former CIA director, former FBI director, former DNI, and now former acting Attorney General all seem to believe the President is compromised by Russia. Let's assume they are all lying - there are others who held these same jobs. Who among them is saying the opposite? None.
@805Maverick @joelpollak This was the third version of the travel ban.
@joelpollak She said she would not implement what she believed to be an unconstitutional order; that order was found to be unconstitutional. Seems like she was right.
@Wind2Energy That's an interesting point of view. Do you believe Americans don't care if their president is compromised by another nation?
@Martinjx1 "The president is not all-in for the United States."
Does not getting "crosswise with Russia" sound like anybody else we know?
The beginning of the interview described consequences of how Michael Flynn might be compromised? Maddow asked if it would mean handing over names of spies? Yates said could be more subtle: might be that he just wouldn't want to get "crosswise" with Russia.
Is that a concerning thing for a former Acting Attorney General of the United States to say? Because it seems a little concerning to me.
Sally Yates is on Maddow right now strongly implying the President of the United States is compromised by the Russians.
@DavidPressman I'll have my assistant reach out. thx

Hey @dloesch, I‚Äôve reached out several times over the last few days to get your comment regarding the massive Russian spy scandal currently immolation your terrorist organization, the NRA. You‚Äôve never hesitated to reach out to me before. Why are you ignoring me now? Thx.

@HarlanCoben @jpodhoretz I‚Äôm saying those of us opposed, not the legislature.
@jpodhoretz I think the consensus from those of us opposed to the war is that the Bush admin, led by Cheney, cherry-picked intelligence info to make the case for war and that Bush willingly bought his bullshit.
That‚Äôs okay. Nobody knows what the guy is saying and we watch him every single day. https://t.co/NMrmrtXDrt
Were the comments that the NRA is a terrorist organization? https://t.co/fMFrBm4Atl
@AmarandAgasi @MalcolmNance @HTBA_Show Thanks, Sean.
@Spider_Hunter @RVAwonk @maddow Thanks!
@RVAwonk @maddow Ok but who is US person 1?
Dana, it's just a little hurtful that you have no problem writing to me out of the blue when I say the NRA is a terrorist organization, but when I write to you to ask about the NRA being investigated about the FBI, you ghost me. I thought we had something.

@trevor_walsh Dip it in soap first.

@trevor_walsh Yeah, it needs to be a mall battery, like a watch battery. Have fun!
By what reason should Trump should be allowed keep his job? The most benign explanation for his behavior is "utter incompetence." Less benign explanations involve psychological illness and deliberate treason. Regardless, he needs to slide that ample ass right out the front door.
@chick_in_kiev I will send Thai divers in to fetch you if it gets too bad. A lot of us are experiencing simillar, but waving hello in the dark helps, I think.
A little concerning that the United States has moved on from talking about whether or not its president is sane to whether or not he's treasonous.
@chick_in_kiev Hang. In. There.

@mic_p_dre @BradThor I‚Äôve rehashed the argument innumerable times so I‚Äôm not going to do it again for you, but feel free to search through my TL for my case.
@mic_p_dre @BradThor And I‚Äôm not trying to convince you. I‚Äôm making a careful (if provocative) argument that the NRA is a terrorist organization. You may not be persuaded but that doesn‚Äôt make the charge inaccurate.
@mic_p_dre @BradThor I don‚Äôt take offense and I have drawn a distinction between those belong to the NRA and those who control it or speak for it. Moreover, the NR does not commit overt acts of terrorism but rather aids, abets, and profts from terrorism.
Oh shit, I just realized I forgot a major addition to this list: I knew I was forgetting somebody important: @Amy_Siskind is a must-follow.
@mic_p_dre @BradThor I have conversations with their supporters all the time.
@BQQuinn @SI_badboy Congrats to all of you except Joe.
Hi @bradthor, wondering if you have had a chance to speak to leadership at the NRA yet about the funding they received from Russia? During our (very civil and good) Twitter convo, you said you would look into this. Thanks.

@TonyDLeonardi @XMalice Yes. Ultimately this is the crux of the argument: states‚Äô rights vs. fear of federal overreach. So while we fret about a hypothetical future tyranny, we live in a present one that allows 30k+ gun deaths per year.
@fathanunk Thanks! It‚Äôs currently my favorite thing to do.
@JosephPSimonLaw Feels too vague to be useful right now but I like the general concept.
@TonyDLeonardi @XMalice I‚Äôm not sure that there‚Äôs any applicable precedent given our history with firearms, nor do I know of any comparable nation that currently has a total ban on gun ownership.
@cicero418 So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance.
@TonyDLeonardi @XMalice I‚Äôm not sure I follow this argument; many nations allow individual firearm ownership without a constitutionally enshrined right. Why would it be different here?

I have had many conversations with NRA members in which I make this point: a terrorist is someone who directly engages in acts of terror. A terrorist organization is a structure that (among other things) uses terror to achieve a political aim. That is the NRA. https://t.co/rZG9B3iuE7

@DLoesch The video I just linked is from McClatchy reporter Greg Gordon.
Here's a "Meet the Press" video about whether the FBI is investigating Russia using the NRA to funnel money to the Trump campaign.  https://t.co/ac0gy1W5wj
And at least a few dozen Russians with deep pockets. https://t.co/6lMhgMlONE
Are you sure you're Dana and not the Dana bot? We went over this at the beginning of our conversation last night and I don't want to rehash. But yes, your group, the NRA, is a terrorist organization. I'll keep saying it and you'll keep doin' what it is you do. https://t.co/NkXer2Q0AL
"it was reported the FBI is investigating whether a Kremlin-linked Moscow businessman channelled money to the group‚Äôs campaign to help Donald Trump win the election." https://t.co/2uX1TfLiuB
My witch hunt? I'm not the FBI. I'm just a D List actor with too much time on his hands. As the mouthpiece for a terrorist organization, I'd think it'd be easier to debunk my claims. https://t.co/8Vt7lumdcU
@KristerJohnson Damn. Well, back to turning folks gay, I guess.
But yeah, the FBI is investigating your terrorist organization over $35 bucks and a magazine subscription.  https://t.co/qwJj0oaQ4j
So all of these connections between Alexander Torshin, the Kremlin, and the NRA are over $35 membership dues?  https://t.co/of9uEwbk19 https://t.co/J7AJ6EvD2K
And why is the NRA "gathering docs amid scrutiny over ties to Kremlin-linked banker" over *years* related to Torshin and his protege?  https://t.co/U4VT89f8p4
You said it was one ex-pat. So why did a "web of elite Russians meet with NRA execs" during the Trump campaign? https://t.co/MxqnaJG6cR
You said it was one ex-pat. Then why did you then disclose two dozen other additional Russian contributors? https://t.co/S5GywCQKXB https://t.co/SyVKJL2HLG
Here's an article entitled "Inside the Decade-Long Russian Campaign to Infiltrate the NRA and Help Elect Trump." But yeah, it was one ex-pat who gave a couple thousand bucks. Keep lying, Dana.  https://t.co/MgoZ4RBFvw https://t.co/LAHL6h1Rt1
And here's the RAND study which itself uses thousands of studies to reach its conclusions: https://t.co/zLrgFzycLf
The specific policies they mention are the "Stand your ground" laws and reciprocal concealed carry permits. And before you say it's the liberal Washington Post, the article uses a RAND corporation study to reach their findings.
Here's the Washington Post saying your terrorist organization, the NRA, is "making crime worse." https://t.co/5D1VtoOSdz https://t.co/LpOeRNlQPp
@davidmweissman Takes two seconds on Google.
@curlycomedy Also: I'm very handsome.
And just in case people don't want to read a couple paragraphs, here's the most relevant sentence from the Congressional report about your terrorist organization, Dana: "The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to secretly fund Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign."
Sorry, I said it would only be two tweets, but I just wanted to point out a couple paragraphs from that report. https://t.co/uhyxyeVrSp
As for Russia, it doesn't seem like Congress would be investigating Russia over a couple thousand bucks by "an ex pat." Yet here's a congressional report...  https://t.co/MTlF6ghvEX
Ooooh... I see the confusion. You're saying I said something I never said. I said that your terrorist organization, the NRA, uses "every available means to put as many guns into the hands of as many people as possible." I didn't say they are direct retailers. 1/2 https://t.co/czPR9QvI2H
@seamck14 I mean, if you think it'll help... I CONDEMN YOU!
Going to assume that since @DLoesch didn‚Äôt correct my statement that it is correct. Biggest question right now around NRA is exactly how much Russian money they‚Äôve illegally funneled into American political campaigns.

Sorry. I was watching ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.‚Äù (Very good, BTW.) I‚Äôm not sure what answer you‚Äôre trying to goad me into but I will repeat that your terrorist organization, the NRA, is the political and marketing front for death merchants, and you are their mouthpiece. https://t.co/EnPcRXdCcG
Maybe you could ask the question in a different way because I‚Äôve tried answering in as many ways as I can think to answer. Your terrorist organization, the NRA, is dedicated to increasing access to the weaponry they know will be abused. That is your job. That is what you do. https://t.co/65opgEREOW
You do the same thing. You attempt to create the conditions for the addicts of gun violence to get their fix. And you are successful. We lose so many to gun violence because pushers like you love that sweet blood money.
The analogy is accurate. A cigarette salesperson does not literally supply cigarettes to their addicts because that would defeat their purpose of profiting from their addictions. Instead they help create the conditions for the addict to have access to the deadly product. https://t.co/ea3HlJhEUU
I‚Äôve answered it twice and will answer again. Your terrorist organization, the NRA, is the political and marketing front for death merchants. Your job is to increase gun violence the same way a cigarette salesperson‚Äôs job is to increase lung cancer. https://t.co/T9LauC6zb3

Happy to answer. Twofold:  1. Using blood money to buy influence with legislators to make sure guns are readily available (supply). 2. By using terroristic rhetoric to capitalize on the massacres you enable (demand). https://t.co/3vnzDcYypY
@carlosalazraqui Of course. They‚Äôre playing the odds knowing that these massacres will happen and capitalizing on them for further gun sales when they do. It‚Äôs grotesque.

@Gjmartinez210 @SouthernKeeks Just to through your list of male attributes. Is your wife not: Appropriate Well-mannered Civil Strong moral values Protective of her family Disciplinarian Ethical Self-sacrificing?
@bandlersbanter Yeah, exactly. To be inspired by feminism would be really helpful for men to develop their own language of gender.
@bandlersbanter The article doesn't say that at all. It calls for learning the lessons of feminism, in particular developing a language of masculinity, to help the problems with boys.
@markyugen Yup.
@Gjmartinez210 @SouthernKeeks I think all of these are great attributes. What distinguishes them from how you would describe a woman?

@DesireeSeattle @SouthernKeeks @molratty I think you're spot on with this.
@bandlersbanter I'm using your definition, Aaron. If you've got a better one, I'd love to hear it.
@bandlersbanter Ok, but you and I right now engaging in the same exact behavior: so, by that definition, you are also not a real man.
@bandlersbanter I don't know what that means, Aaron. What is the opposite of me? Can you define it? Or is it just one of those, "I know you are but what am I" type insults?
I really don't care. Do you? https://t.co/MQi1zOKrEw
Whoa - she's excellent. https://t.co/pWtAzFMZRa
@SouthernKeeks @molratty I'm not asking you to change it, just looking for further definition.
@SouthernKeeks @molratty I wasn't looking for a "solution." I never asked for one. I only asked for your definition of a "Real Man," which you don't have except that he is pro-life and doesn't make certain kinds of jokes.
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Ok, so you believe Ronald Reagan was not a "real man." Have you considered what makes a Real Man beyond being pro-life? Do you have examples of who *is* a Real Man?
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Again, I'm just trying to understand what a "Real Man" is from your point of view.
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Which goes against the idea that a Real Man does not make jokes about the taking of human life. So was Ronald Reagan *not* a real man? (He also signed a bill in 1967 allowing abortion in California.)  https://t.co/m0sb18zCrR
@SouthernKeeks @molratty We agree rape and incest are horrifying crimes, but you get into tricky territory here as it relates to pro-life being the position of "Real Men." Ronald Reagan, for example, was pro-life except in those cases. He also joked about bombing the Soviet Union 1/2
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Again, you can read my thread from last night to understand my position. It's too difficult to rehash piecemeal.
@dannyboi965 Used to be a weekly before the magazine industry collapsed. :(
@SouthernKeeks @molratty So, for example, would a real man ALWAYS be opposed to abortion: even in the case of rape, incest, or the life of a mother? Or can a real man support those incidences?
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Got it. Being pro-life is your starting point. What else?
God no. It's an atrium. https://t.co/x6F28LbgN7
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Because it was a long and nuanced discussion. I'm just asking you for *your* definition of a "real man," a topic in which I'm interested because I'm writing a book about it.
@SouthernKeeks @molratty I didn't make a claim to true masculinity. I don't know what that means. I asked for *your* definition of a "real man." As for abortion, I had a long conversation last night with another conservative defining my position, which I would encourage you to read. Don't want to rehash.
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Also, where am I inconsistent? Thanks.
@SouthernKeeks @molratty Right - I addressed the first part, not the second, because we're not going to agree on what "innocent in their womb" means. Is that the entirety of your definition of a "real man"? If not, what else is a real man?
@molratty @SouthernKeeks She said I am not a "real man." She didn't answer, but you did. I am dissecting your definition. That isn't deflecting. Next, you said a real man is somebody who takes personal responsibility for his actions. What actions of mine do you think I haven't taken responsibility for?
@molratty @SouthernKeeks They *were* jokes. You can look them up. As far as deflecting goes, I'm confronting your arguments head on. (Actually I was confronting Kimberly's, but she seems to be relying on yours.)
@molratty @SouthernKeeks Ronald Reagan: "We begin bombing in five minutes." John McCain: (singing) "Bomb, bomb, bomb bomb Iran."
@molratty @SouthernKeeks So, by the definition of someone "who doesn't make jokes about ending a human life," was Ronald Reagan a real man? Is John McCain?
@SouthernKeeks I hear you. You're saying what a real man *isn't*. But that's not what I asked. I asked what a real man is. If your definition of a *real man* is a "voice for vulnerable women" I would argue that's exactly what I am. Does your definition of real man extend past that? I'm curious.
@SouthernKeeks Kimberly, what is a "real man"?
Got it, you're an anti-Trump Republican. So I misread you based on a tweet. Wonder where I've seen that before...? https://t.co/7lbWv85CMN

@Heminator Similar ideas pepper my book, not necessarily with the "manual labor theme" because I am inept with my hands, but notions of traditional masculinity, what it means and doesn't mean, and how we can expand it to encompass our full selves as men.
@Heminator Is that good or bad? I would argue good, that individual freedom brings complications but rewards. Working with our hands certainly feels great for everybody, regardless of gender, as all physical exertion does. I'm all for more of it for everybody, starting with myself.
@Heminator Those roles could also be constraining for both sexes. The path we've followed since is murkier, and probably no happier than the one behind us. But we've granted ourselves more opportunities to fulfill our destinies in ways probably unimaginable to the folks of his youth.
@Heminator To say that these were "happy marriages" because the men did manual labor? How does he know how happy these marriages were? How does he know how the women felt in those marriages? There's much to love about a simpler, binary era when men and women fulfilled assigned roles.
@Heminator I read it. It IS terrifically written but I think it's overly romantic. Take this paragraph: https://t.co/ycymUz8OtA
@DaveWeasel I MAKE GOOD POINTS!!!
@Liz_Wheeler Ok, going to watch the first episode of Season 2 of "The Handmaid's Tale." Will speak more later if you like. Glad we agree on so much.
@Liz_Wheeler But you HAVE established right/wrong: you've said life begins at conception. If that's so, why would you not penalize the person who commissioned the hit man, only the hit man? That doesn't make sense.
@Liz_Wheeler Again, we agree. It's not a perfect metric, which is exactly why I said I didn't know if it was best or not. I'm asking again, if abortion is "killing unborn humans," what should be the penalty for those who have them? Why is this so hard to answer?
@Liz_Wheeler You believe the moment is conception, so I ask you again: what should the penalty be for "killing an unborn human"?
@Liz_Wheeler Is that the best metric? I don't know, but I know a fertilized egg is not a human being. I also know that a 9 month old about to be born is. Question, as always, is where is the line? Again, I don't know.
@Liz_Wheeler Seems like a human to me. Again, we agree. The fundamental question in the abortion debate, as always, is at what point does the procedure cross the line into killing a human. Historically, the metric we use is "viability," the point at which an embryo could live on its own.
@sfierri STRONGLY AGREE!!!
@theNuzzy @WalshFreedom Thanks, Nuzz.
@Liz_Wheeler We agree. Science has given us different names to describe the different phases of human development from zygote on. For example, here is a picture of the egg at the moment of fertilization. Is this a human? https://t.co/qArT2Yiwfo
@Liz_Wheeler Also, you haven't answered my question. If abortion is "killing unborn humans," should an abortion be considered murder? What should the appropriate penalty be?
@Liz_Wheeler Got it. I absolutely agree that human life begins at conception - when else would it begin? But science does not agree that the initial fertilized egg is a "human." In that case, an embryo is also a human. Should unused embryos for in vitro be considered people?
@Liz_Wheeler Liz?
@Liz_Wheeler But you didn't answer my question: if we are "killing unborn babies" through abortion, what should the appropriate punishment be for the woman who has the abortion and the doctor who performs it?
@Liz_Wheeler Great. So we agree the death penalty is wrong. We also are both pro-science. And we agree that it comes down to when "life begins." But science does not say at conception. Science says life is a process. For example, a sperm is "alive."
If the death penalty is not the correct punishment, what is? Legitimately curious.
Again, I get your argument: abortion is murder, yes? And murder, according to most conservatives, deserves the death penalty. I assume you are pro death penalty, and so the logical conclusion is that women who have abortions and their providers should be given the death penalty? https://t.co/p6L6VO7gEn
I get it - you dislike abortions. So do I. But you're mad at a joke, not that women's rights are now under dire threat. Once we criminalize personal healthcare we criminalize individual freedom. But yeah, a comedian made a joke. Be best. https://t.co/04NYP4XPyr

Stock up on abortions now. Roe v. Wade is gone.
Yes, everything is incremental. They ARE coming for Muslims, immigrants, unions, women‚Äôs rights. Soon, it will be academics, journalists, LGBT. It will be free speech. We already know where this is headed - we‚Äôre just waiting to see who, if anybody, stops them. https://t.co/ZyIJORV5u3
@HarlanCoben (Good argggh BTW, not bad argggh)
@HarlanCoben By the way - the end of ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù? Arggggh.
@HarlanCoben It was an amazing exchange.
They put kids in cages. Yesterday they came for Muslims and women‚Äôs rights. Today they came for unions. They‚Äôre not going to stop. That Niemoller poem asked who is going to stop them when they come for you? Be best, y‚Äôall.
@inkyelbows @AlgonquinBooks @nytimes Thank you, Debbie!
@MickeyFisher73 He's pretty much got it nailed.
@ChrisMinervini @warnerthuston Agreed! I am often effeminate! Not sure why Warner couldn't say that.
@IanEnsign They're saying it'll be out fall 2019. Writing it now. Books take a while. Don't worry, I'm going to promote the fuck out of it when it's available.
@joeltweetsjoel Not for a while, but thanks.
@RyanRossoArt I asked myself the same question about qualifications. In the end, I decided I am as qualified as anybody to write this book by virtue of being a man for almost 50 years. As for depression: yes. Addicted to outrage: maybe. Feeling small: sometimes, yes. What're your excuses?
@moshekasher With all due respect, your face is.
@jpodhoretz I wish! *Zips up thigh high boots, begins walking.*
This is legit hilarious to me. This guy, a "writer for Breitbart" began our conversation by calling me a "Weak Little Nancy Boy." This is his last message to me. You should read the whole thread. https://t.co/2znj9EB9ad
@warnerthuston As for "telling you what I mean," I sent you an entire OpEd. So you should know *exactly* what I mean. How does any of this make me:   1. Weak 2. Little 3. Effeminate of homosexual  These are *your* words, Warner. If you can't defend them, I'm happy to accept your apology.
@warnerthuston Here is the definition of Nancy Boy: https://t.co/H5kC2uMglO
@mgwynnjones Yes. I own it and am a fan of Robert's, but have purposely not read it through yet because I don't want to be influenced. I have glanced at it, though, and I suspect we touch on similar themes but I think the books will be quite different.
@warnerthuston Great, but you still haven't answered my questions.  1. How am I weak? 2. How am I "little"? 3. What do you even mean by "Nancy Boy" Do you mean gay?
@peachiestkari So sorry. The Breitbart crowd has been great today. Very grateful to them for energizing me. Please give your brother a hearty hello to me when you talk to him next.
@warnerthuston You're welcome. To follow up. How am I either weak, little, or a "Nancy Boy"? Not sure what you mean by any of it.
@warnerthuston I would argue that saying "society is broken" is far more general than saying there are significant problems with the way we approach masculinity. Also, you began this conversation by calling me a "Weak Little Nancy Boy," but still haven't explained what you mean. How am I weak?
@peachiestkari It's the conversation I'm trying to have.
@peachiestkari The thing is, without knowing your dad, I would bet money he thought he was protecting him.
@warnerthuston Yes. All I'm asking for is you to accurately quote me the way I quoted you calling yourself "writer for Breitbart." Since you're having trouble finding my position, I'll give it to you: https://t.co/bPL5gLMdNC
@peachiestkari Wow.
@warnerthuston The insult is directed at Breitbart, not you. I believe you that you are a writer for them; only put it in quotes to refer to your own bio. And no, accurately quoting your bio is not the same as calling somebody "Weak Little Nancy Boy," which you still haven't explained.
@warnerthuston Where did I say that masculinity needs to be "fixed." You keep throwing out charges that are unsupported by my words. Instead, it seems like you have an idea of what I mean in your head and are determined to pursue it regardless of anything I've said.
@warnerthuston If you agree that men comport themselves differently, then you agree that masculinity is not fixed. In agreeing but also insulting me, you seem to be insisting that there is a "correct" way to express masculinity and an incorrect way. True?
@warnerthuston As a "writer for Bretibart" it seems like you'd want to be able to back up wild assertions with some evidence. (I'm being generous to Breitbart here.) Where did I ever equate masculinity with cancer?
@warnerthuston I suspect you're equating "masculinity" with a binary idea of "gender." Two different things unless you think men can only be one way. I don't. For example, Babe Ruth and Albert Einstein were both men but expressed their masculinity very differently.
@warnerthuston But I get it; easiest way to attack a guy raising an uncomfortable topic is to insult his masculinity. I talk about that in the book - hope you'll read.
@warnerthuston Expand is probably a better word, but using the insult "Weak Little Nancy Boy" makes me reconsider which word would be better.
@DavidYazbek Was going to offer you 60%.
@peachiestkari Men sometimes sound like cartoon bugs.
@warnerthuston Where did I blame "masculinity" for anything? How do you think "society" exists separate and apart from masculinity? Do you think they are unrelated?
@DLoesch Dana?
@warnerthuston Warner?
@peachiestkari You're very kind, but the truth is I fully expected this when I started speaking about this topic and have been surprised it hasdn't happened sooner.
@warnerthuston Can you explain what you mean by ‚ÄúWeak Little Nancy Boy‚Äù?
@Mike_Eagle Feels pretty great.
@Mike_Eagle I did that!
@ParkerMolloy And she knew that when she did it.
@dnjscott531 Hi Dan. Setting aside the hacky insult, what makes you say that?

@Estrada1001matt A child who arrives alone (a refugee) can be provided social services, care, and support while their case works through the system. Good refugee care is important and humane. When a child arrives with a parent, they should be provided with the same services WITH their parent.
@Estrada1001matt I will happily engage with a good faith conversation with you on this. You present a false and binary choice. First, we‚Äôre talking about children who arrived with a parent being separated, not a child who arrives alone.

To think that she would reach the US and have them take her disabled daughter from her is gut-wrenching. What they‚Äôre doing to these families is monstrous.
What would she have done if we‚Äôd grown somewhere where she felt our lives were in danger? She would have walked us to safety.
My mother would have done anything to keep all of us safe and fought for years with the state of New Jersey to ensure she got the schooling she deserved, even though it required a lawsuit.
She could not have cared for herself beyond getting dressed. To be separated from our family would have been terrifying for her and utterly unimaginable for my mother.
I don‚Äôt talk about this often in public because I am protective of her but I have a sister with Down Syndrome. When she was 10, she could have told you her name in her slurred way. She could not have told you her mother‚Äôs name or where she lived.

Had Trump said during the election he was going to put immigrant children in cages, he probably would've gotten more Republicans to support him.
@sasddl SUPER!
@KatyVancil @davidcrosss Hahaha
EQUALLY IMPORTANT: My "How to Be Amazing" interview with David Cross @davidcrosss is up and excellent because he is excellent. Listen hither, thither, or here:  https://t.co/aUIO9eKNym
IMPORTANT REMINDER: I have a new podcast called "Obscure," in which I read "Jude the Obscure" out loud and comment on it as I go. Listen on itunes or Stitcher or direct from the source. https://t.co/u4AW1gI0f3
There‚Äôs so much sickness and corruption coming from the White House that it might be best if we just erect a chain link partition around it. #BeBest
I don't know if this is a good idea or a bad idea, but I like the name Space Force. https://t.co/0qf6uA9W2v
@Sumtinstink Great. Glad we agree. Hope you'll continue to speak out.

@Danaconda813 Doesn't matter.
So you agree it's a tragedy? Great. Please join me in condemning it. https://t.co/1gD1YbU3jX
MATES fans: my partner @CavanaghTom is off playing the Flash on HBO or something but if you need to hit your snackology jones, these guys are in the game. https://t.co/HZLPXN1kFA
@Cap_Kaveman @timagne @CavanaghTom That's great.
@Sumtinstink Oh hey Rodney. I have condemned the practice of putting children in cages regardless of who does it - do you?
2014: 276 girls forcibly taken by Boko Haram. 2018: At least 1,000 girls forcibly taken by US gov't.  Where are the girls?
Rodney?
@natfeelco Natalie, just wait. It gets sexy!
As much as I criticize him, I have to give Trump credit for changing the way things normally get done - most dictators go after the kids last.

I'm not entirely opposed to putting people in cages. I'd love to see Stephen Miller in one.
@andylassner @OhNoSheTwitnt @RexHuppke @markhoppus @HarlanCoben @DannyZuker @SortaBad @mikd33 Odds of me being their dad are probably less than 1 in 4.
@HarlanCoben @andylassner @OhNoSheTwitnt @LOLGOP @MollyJongFast @RexHuppke @markhoppus @DannyZuker @SortaBad @mikd33 I mean... you're nice?
Hi Rodney, still waiting.
@SarahThyre @goldengateblond Only the sexiest projects with my dad.
So we agree putting children in cages is horrible and inhumane. I condemn anybody who would do it - do you? https://t.co/5yZTrydTSk
