@adamhegedus @FakieFrankie Adam, no  offense but I was there. I'm not trying to be a d***. Just being honest.
@businessinsider truth is that @FakieFrankie's doping wasn't "at one point" but rather "the majority" of his career. #fact
Now to the other July cycling tradition @RAGBRAI_IOWA Best of luck to @TJRAGBRAI and all the riders in Iowa this week.
@rouleurmagazine Lavanu ought to be sent home too.
@sacca amen
@JeremyRoussel rain check. I'm in @aspenco.
2/2 truly humbled by the response from the French public. To say our history is complicated would be an understatement. Merci 4 the support!
1/2 Back home. Had some time to reflect on my time in France w/ the @TdF1DayAhead team. 2 things - awfully impressed with those riders and..
Thoughts go out to the family of Marcelo  Flores on his passing. He rode on the @Texas4000 a few years back. http://t.co/4CkFJWan9x

@Stefan_DeVriese thanks dude! Good memories with you here
Incredible first day w/ the @TdF1DayAhead crew. Hot &amp; hilly but gr8 time. And a big thanks/merci to the French people for the warm welcome
@SSbike @SkyOrla @TdF1DayAhead Shane, what is the last donation you made to a charity? Or volunteered for?
@jeremycwhittle sorta the way he views his peers.

Fascinating lunch with @Pam_Alexander and @markpinc. Thanks for your time y'all.
@StephenAir negative. Great question tho
. @danieljcastille I'm not accusing anyone   In fact, quite the opposite. I'm not interested (nor do I have the credibility) to opine there.
@jono1000 perhaps indeed.
@jamie_storey who's throwing stones?!?
Finally, this @letour is NOT over. Those initial hard efforts that Sky put out today tend to add up and there is a ton of racing left.
@thepieman84 I agree
3. Nibali's tour looks to be over.
2. The first mtn stage is always unpredictable. The day after a rest day is also unpredictable. Combine the two and its 10x.
1. Clearly Froome/Porte/Sky are very strong. Too strong to be clean? Don't ask me, I have no clue.
Getting lots of questions regarding today's first mountain stage @letour. Some thoughts to follow.
@PeteScobell likewise bro. Aspen is a small town. Let's connect after I return from @TdF1DayAhead. Cc @KidRock
Thinking about @ivanbasso and wishing him the very best as he embarks on his cancer journey. #IvanSTRONG!!

Appreciated the opp 2 speak 2 @StephaneMandard from @lemondefr however didn't appreciate the twisting of my words. Sorry for the confusion.

@therealfakebill @Digger_forum i agree
.@johnleicester 99-05. I was clear with @StephaneMandard on this. Today? I have no idea. I'm hopeful it's possible.
@dwuori I did not

@luke0411 @blameitonandy @dwuori @LeviLeipheimer you have no idea
@dwuori @LeviLeipheimer @luke0411 I guess I wasn't one of the "10 or so"...

Congrats @LIVESTRONGCEO and AG on the arrival of Sam Ulman!! Happy and healthy.
@MMinSC @msnbc if everyone in the nfl is accused of murder then it's a fair comparison. Otherwise, not so much so.
@kevinrross and 86, 89, and 90
Happy birthday @KShoptaw!!!
@Greg_Keller @sampetrequin man, you have a creative sense of interpretation
@Greg_Keller @sampetrequin not on page 66, that i can see.
@Greg_Keller @sampetrequin who the fuck did that?
@sampetrequin ignorance is bliss
@sampetrequin that's not for me to decide. I'll let the others debate that.
@FrankPucher @LTRaceSeries negative
Ride file from today's mtb ride in @AspenCO. This is a good loop for someone looking to go hard but technically easy http://t.co/SSULg4GcD4

@drmiles85 has the added benefit of actually being true
@wieslawb @z1z2z @yespleasenurse correct
Thinking of @joedutton and @cityofcalgary folks up North battling the floods.  Great part of the world.  Be safe out there y'all

Greetings from the Armstrong family to yours. Family dinner at the Holuakoa Cafe! http://t.co/xYxCu4OSSa
@nailbomb3 @smnb absolutely not. Never.
@nailbomb3 @smnb was NEVER offered that deal
@Vaughters @MarkRechtin @CensoredCyclist @letour @NBCSN like, uh, a 100?
@MarkRechtin @letour @NBCSN precisely. WWIII!
@sarcastitom @smnb @FakeFloydLandis @veloclinic fellas, this is above my pay grade. I'm going golfing.
@Leds0206 @S8Stocks @smnb amen
@S8Stocks @smnb oh yeah? How so?
@smnb they don't want that. They got their man (and set a legal precedent going fwd).
@smnb you Brits. It's asshole not arsehole. Haha! But yes, u are right, yet that is not in any code..
@smnb so one man gets life and everyone else off scot free? Really?
@dpTomlinson @smnb fair enough. So no heroes for you?
@smnb my wrongs or our wrongs?
@theunzippedfly thanks!!
Hanging out with my son @lukearmstrong in the Kohalas yesterday! http://t.co/YSzOjceEpX

@paulsen_smw yeah, that's never happened before.
@DanielCoyle errr, really? Lots still to learn Dan.
@KeatingSports @ReillyRick that's not Rick's fault - it's mine. Place the blame on me for not being honest with him
@bkhooray hey man, I am sorry.

@_JHellBoy_ it's "y'all"
@dennismcarey love it. David (Garrido) is a good friend.
@ad_I_am @billmcferson that whole 'pissin up a rope' thing I never quite got
@luke0411 fair question but I'm too removed 2 know. My sense is that things are way different. However, the events of the last yr aren't why
@luke0411 Luke - the past year we heard stories from the 90's and early '00's. ppl have lost perspective of time. It's 2013, btw.
Thanks to Kohala Ziplines for a great day! http://t.co/QnvzC7Gbkt

@Andylanger @brian_mansfield hey guys, greetings from Hawaii. This news made a good day even better. All my best.
@ad_I_am whew, at least he didn't call me an asshole.
I'd definitely like to drop a few pounds but i've had enough of these bullshit garcinia extract spam tweets.
@KenBobPryde well said mate.
@EricGregg300 @RedHourBen don't remind him!
Dear @ATT - please turn the mobile phone service back on here in Hawaii. Thanks, Lance

@Ludoviclonger read it. Thank you.
@cyberjunkie21 @LizKreutz we can score u one of those
@CavortinNorton @DanceMoms uh, really? The latter I can confirm.
@CavortinNorton @DanceMoms can't say that i caught it. Or ever even heard of it.
@Dare2Tri 100% in
@luke0411 no
@luke0411 dude, good question and not one i have the answer to. not that involved anymore at that level. what's clear is change is essential
@sanchez_edmund I don't have the power but I have the desire.
@bandgeekmafia78 go fuck yourself. Leave my kids out of it.
Crazy bday party for @maxarmstrong1! @charliebonney assisting with the cake. Follow lancearmstrong on Mobli  http://t.co/c8VgMVoSd9
@Michael_Birdsng @RedKitePrayer @ironstringmark that's nonsense. I've stated my commitment and it stands. Waiting for the call.
Happy 4th birthday @maxarmstrong1 !!!
@williamsmatthew so far we got one of those.
Wishing Jim Kelly the best. Always loved watching him play. http://t.co/ztp7HpWGNR
@LeamansTerms Yep. Enjoyed a great Sunday with family instead. Fair trade.
@Reid_Rothschild @cdcanning that performance was 100% clean. Like it or not.
Happy 40th bday @pjrabice !
@PelotonCafe @fireflycaelli too bad it's not an accurate depiction of the era
@CateP36 care, so sorry to read this. Hang in there.
@tracy173 excuse me?
@cdcanning really?
Down in New Orleans for my buddy (and incredible artist) Scott Campbell's wedding. Love this town.
@SpenceSmith @spencerwtsmith @BijuTheChef wait, you're not in KISS?

5th grade graduation party for @gracearmstrong and @bellaarmstrong. Calling reinforcements!!! http://t.co/AMS0iG0SbT
@obrienkevin not for a few weeks
@DrHeadgear @Ben_M_Berry @ironstringmark incorrect
@Zeb_King I'm in. @bobkeroll , you in again?
@Ben_M_Berry thanks!! And you'll pay the 100 mil the DOJ wants too?!? Thank you!!!
@Ben_M_Berry @ironstringmark so that leaves two orgs capable of doing that...
@Ben_M_Berry @ironstringmark I hear u but it doesn't work that way. It has to be CONVENED and @UCI_cycling obviously won't do that.
@Ben_M_Berry @ironstringmark essential that @UCI_cycling @wada_ama and @usantidoping make that call. I'm waiting. We are all waiting.
@Ben_M_Berry @ironstringmark and that starts here on twitter? No. It doesn't.
@Ben_M_Berry @ironstringmark ok, how do I so that? I am not in a position to convene anything. I'm a retired athlete, that's it. Zero power.
@tiffanycraven @TheChadMountain 44,154 views...
@ironstringmark I'm just waiting for the call.
@ironstringmark best option to fully address the issue and to move FORWARD. Unfortunately it seems the 3 main entities are opposed to it.
@ChrisBook thx man
@DJLindJr no problem.
@CKleberg @mellowjohnnys heck yeah!! Biggest test an mj's jersey as seen.
@ScottTedro thanks bro
@GregMason82 yessir. #happy10

@jaowen exhibit A
@nealrogers likewise, also tryin to craft a tweet that will resonate, not add to the hysteria, and actually be seen as progressive. #noteasy
@TdFLanterne @inrng @UCI_cycling I would say that is spot on.
Just got word that Andreas Knickman's latest scans came back clean. Yes!!
@McChoudhry @festinagirl honestly, i'm sick of the haggling. time to talk straight and help the sport move on.
@Spanielsson @dustynbutler @festinagirl without a doubt
@festinagirl I'd be happy to.
@dpaustin only one ride so far but rides great.
