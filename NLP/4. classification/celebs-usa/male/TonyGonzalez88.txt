Wanted to say thanks to all the fans for a great season of supporting us. The most fun I've had since I've been in the Atl! Rise up!
So happy to get the win! Way too close for comfort. The rise up nation was rocking the dome. Got to have it again next week!!
Sorry about tweeting about some game yesterday but my phone was hacked by some 2 year old mad man gone wild...my son!
Looking at Disney junior with the kids. It's telling them to stay away from salty snacks and eat fruits n veggies. That away Disney!
Congrats to Jason Witten for getting the TE reception record. A complete TE.

Great team win yesterday. That's how we need to play the rest of the year and on into the playoffs! The dome was rocking as well!
@EdDyGaMeZ happy belated birthday
Thanks to Walmart and all who helped make this a great night for the kids. This will be a Christmas they will never forget.
Watching this game. A bad call can break you. Thoughts?
Thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the deceased. Stay strong KC.
Seriously!! Trying to get to the game! Shame on all of you that have done this before ha!  http://t.co/pIqUOl03
Another close game... Again. But we'll take it! Keep Rollin!
Great story on espn called kick of hope. Check it out if u can. #inspiring

The refs are destroying this game!
Great win for us today! Wasn't the prettiest but we'll take it!
Just got to the hotel in DC and turned on the TV. 4 out of 5 commercials were political. Got to love this city!
Chipper Jones. Here's to a great career!
What is a pop up fly rule? Watching the Braves game obviously.
Watching the debates. Good stuff. Hope everybody else is.
Hanging with the kids today. Thinking of cooking up some salmon.
I've been saying give the refs a break but that TD call was ridicules. How do you miss that? Pop Warner refs would have gotten that right.
Good win for us today against a good team. Got to keep it rolling!
RIP Steve Sabol. I remember growing up watching NFL films. That's where my love for the game started. Thank you.
If you really want to get inside my head as a player check out this interview I did with my old teammate Coy Wire.  http://t.co/PuLiF1sA

Last day of camp today. Glad it's over!! Time to get down to business.
hanging with the fam before the game tonight http://t.co/qcDZNRCj
After your workout what's your power up? Liquid supplements are absorbed more than twice as fast as solids so I stick with liquid nutrition.
Cut back on your added sugar intake today. The average American consumes about 31tsp of added sugar daily or 117lbs of added sugar per year!
Eat organic so your fruits and vegetables are pesticide free, and eat grass-fed meat so it's additive free. Cleaner food is better food!
Just left lunch with my 4 and 2 year old. These kids are so loud I swear people were clapping when we were exiting.
Enjoying the day off with the family having lunch. Good showing by the 1st team offense and defense last night. Keep working.
Often our eyes are bigger than our stomachs so be conscious of how much food is on your plate. Eat enough to be satisfied, not stuffed!
I love watching the Olympics. Marathon swimming is equal to 120 football fields done in 2 hours. It's amazing what human beings can do.
Our bodies don't produce Omega-3 fats but it's important to everyones diet so have flaxseeds, walnuts, beans or fish today for your Omega-3.
Long day! Time to hit the pillow.
Work out instead of veg out and ditch the snacks during your TV time today. Replace the popcorn and chips with crunches and pushups.
Remember to choose organic when buying fruits and vegetables. You can cut your pesticide exposure by up to 90%
Been watching your caloric intake? Watch what you drink! Some speciality coffee drinks can cost you 700 calories! Opt for unsweetened today.
Congrats to Gabby Dougles. I admire someone that can perform under intense pressure and come out on top. Go USA!
If you want to achieve excellence always work your hardest and practice discipline, only then will you perform at your very best.
Watching Olympic boxing...unbelievable! This sport has got to go.
Make sure you get a workout today and remember it's all about quality not quantity so decrease the amount of weight used and focus on form.
First day in pads went well. Guys are looking good.
Camp is going as camp usually goes. The team is working hard!! It's hot!
Try getting your lunch today from a farmers' market, local farm or your own garden. It will help your body and your pocket.
As you go through your day remember to keep hydrated. Divide your body weight by 2 to find out how many ounces you should drink daily!
Check this out, it makes a lot of sense. Things are getting out of control. http://t.co/ZxezAp8O http://t.co/QpsvtB8e

That's what you call a halftime adjustment. NE is one of the best teams in the league at doing that.
Best halftime show I've seen in a while. Madonna is looking good!
Great pass pro there. Don't underestimate the NE offensive line.  they have 3 guys that have played in the probowl.
Bradshaw makes the Giant offense go. When he's running well they are almost unstoppable.
Super bowl finally. Can't wait to get home to the kids.

Don't worry heat fans. They will win at least 3 of them.
This game is over. Happy for J Kidd!
I said it b4 and ill say it again, the charging call is a cop out....play defense! Can't stand that call.
You might have heard this before but its so true. "These are the good ol days". So enjoy the moment.

Why keep trying to block Dirks shot. Let him shoot. He's 7 feet!
http://twitgoo.com/2byuir view from where I'm watching the game....HB!
I mean allowed.
U should not be aloud to take a charge on a fast break. Such a cop out move....make a play!
Alright halftime is here. Labron steps up the second half. Dirk keeps doing what he's been doing. Good game so far. Watch.
If Wade is out its over. Unless Labron can go for 40 and Bosh for 25.
Labron goes for 30 tonight...at least.

@Playboi_92 Always excited to get back on the field!
@cjh8837 Hawks looked good last night, I wonder how Rose's injury will effect the series
@screamalejandro I'm excited, he's a great receiver and it will hopefully spread the defense out and open it up for more passes to me haha
U know I love my Lakers but I wouldn't be to upset if my CAL brethren Jason Kidd got a title.
Round 2 starts tonight, let's GO #LAKERS
http://twitgoo.com/28qpas see the squat technique...off-season workout baby! Ok I'm taking the day off.
http://twitgoo.com/28qp9k in the garden with the little one. Nothing like fresh veggies.
Anyone know what's going on?? You know what, I'll figure it out and get back to you all!
Lockout is back on, UNBELIEVABLE!! To everyone out there, I think I'm just as confused as you are about what's going on!
#Lakers close out their first round series & the #dirtybirds got a great addition to the offense, pretty good night!
Watching this draft let's u know how big the NFL is. All u fans are great!
That's a great move by the dirty birds! Welcome to the team Julio.
Not surprised about the #1 pick
Draft time!
@rockstarz30 @tcocrane Great that's a name in the drawing, keep going so you have more names in the drawing and more opportunities to win
All my fans on Facebook fans hit their goal last weekend so I hope my Twitter fans can show them up!
As a reminder, the 3 prizes are: Autographed mini helmet, football, and jersey (if we make it by weekend).  Good luck!
I took away the jersey since we didn't get there by the end of the weekend, but id be willing to bring it back if we got there this weekend
Hey Guys, looks like you all forgot about the 60K contest!  Haven't got there yet, keep referring people to get more names in the drawing!
Closing out the series tonight, go #Lakers
What sprain?! Lakers looked good!
@LEGENDARYMG You can find info for all of our products: http://allproscience.com/nutritional-supplements-and-products/
@trurideordie Hard to answer that not knowing what sports he plays and what his overall workout goals are
@SenorMalcolm It's made for post-workout but we are launching our Pre-Charge in a few weeks which is great for Pre-workout
@SenorMalcolm to help with electrolyte replacement try out Recovery, it's not a pill but works great:http://allproscience.com/recovery.html
Congrats to APS athlete Joe Williams winning the 185 Pound belt!  http://yfrog.com/gzk53yuj
Lakers are gonna rock staples center tonight, gotta shut down Chris Paul!
I hope Kobe's MRI goes well today
Happy Easter Everyone!
Don't forget if we get to 60K followers by the end of this weekend I'll draw a winner for an autographed jersey too but only if we get there
I hope everyone has a great weekend & a happy Easter!
@OneDayGM Refer people 2 follow me & have them put "referred by @yourname" & each person u refer u will get u an extra name in the drawing
Make ya a deal, if we get to 60K by the end of the weekend I'll add a Jersey as a prize too (3 winners) but only if we get to 60K by Sunday!
Refer people to follow me and have them put "referred by @yourname" & each person you refer you will get you an extra name in the drawing!
Hey guys, let's keep working to get me to 60K! I want to give the mini helmet and football away!
Last Day For a Chance to Double Your Order For Free! http://icont.ac/Xlm
Glad my #Lakers won last night, but they still need to step it up and play better!
I love how the baseball coaches wear the same uniform as the players. Makes me laugh! Imagine football or B-ball coaches doing that. Ha!
Lakers are taking Game 2 tonight, have to get the ball inside to Gasol & Bynum!
Our schedule is out! Great match ups, very excited for the upcoming season! Hopefully the #NFL will end the Lockout and #LetUsPlay

Hey Guys check out APS athlete Anthony Slama, @Slama39 he's gonna be the next great pitcher in the MLB!
@rixorz555 don't think they'd like u giving out their numbers. We have had probs w/ profile creation for contests so im always skeptical ha!
As a reminder, creating profiles and following me won't get you extra names in the drawing...it's very easy to tell which profiles are fake
Each person you refer gets you an extra name in the drawing, have them say u referred them. If everyone gets one we'll get there in no time!
Hey Guys I want to get to 60K followers, can u help? Refer someone & be entered in a drawing to win one of these:  http://yfrog.com/h4jodphj
My buddy Tulowitzki is ridiculous right now, he and the Rockies are unstoppable
@CoolChick15 The Lakers are my team so I'd have to pick the Lakers

Congrats to Uconn. Butler had a great year and u can't take that away.
Im sorry but what a horrible game. Didn't look like the 2 best teams in the country.
Like I said before...too athletic and too big.
You can not win a game without points in the paint. Game over.
Make a shot!
Uconn looks way more athletic and bigger. Waiting for Mack to get going.
Can't wait for the big game tonight!
I'm going with Uconn, but I I'm kinda hoping Butler wins! I like when the underdogs win
Gonna be a great National Championship tonight!
Well im glad I got one game right. I'm going with Uconn on Monday. But I can't lie I'm hoping Butler wins.
@BrianPriester we have a lot of diff supplements, check them all out at allproscience.com thanks!
Looks like VCU's magic is just about up, heck of a run though!
http://twitgoo.com/22i64y In the garden with Mom. Fresh veggies for the summer!

NY is freezing but I love this city.
Excited for baseball season to start this week, my Halos are gonna make a run this year!
Wow no #1 seeds in the final four! Gotta love March Madness and the Cinderella VCU story. Who do you guys have winning it now?
Wow VCU is just letting KU right back into this game
I got KU left according to my bracket to win it, but if Arizona plays like they did last night I don't know who can beat them
http://twitgoo.com/21vngj I have my boy helping out at work today haha. Future APS athlete!
It's going to be a great night of basketball tonight!
I know I had Duke to win it all but if they had to loose I'm glad it was a Pac 10 team. The Wildcats played lights out.
@iowahawksfan06 You should use some Creatine with some protein, it's the best for muscle mass
It never rains in Southern California....yea right. It's raining cats and doggies out here!
@ethjoe You need to eat healthy, don't cheat, and supplement smart with your workouts

@Tez_THEGREAT90 Hard work, dedication, passion, eating, working out & supplementing right, & the drive to keep going & never quit

@OneDayGM It's different for everyone, but I love our Veggie protein! But I would only recommend it to you if your vegan or vegetarian

Wow what a great first round of the tournament, I hope tonight's games are just as good
Watching the tournament. Gonzaga knows how to pass the ball. I guess with John Stocktons boy they better.

@z4willy All the protein products are great, just depends what flavor you prefer, but the Pure Creatine is good for building muscle mass.

@Cabayero Check out APS Grass Fed Whey http://bit.ly/bgIT3R
@Deano7180 Start practicing before everyone and stay till the lights go out.  Its all about hard work
@Quackarazzi There isn't a miracle cure for that, make sure you're hydrated & have good foods in your system.  It takes time
@DinaTG Not too sure about that, but watching where you get your food helps. Buy fresh food & lots of veggies, they're good for the heart
@SeanRobinson09 Creatine is a tough one, it has its good uses but some people abuse it.  If you're smart it can help
@Quackarazzi A good pre-workout will help keep your energy up
@TJAY_G6 If you don't have a protein, check out what we're doing at APS
@j_barty_party not too much Vitamin C but a good 3:1 mix of protein to carbs
@Gerbalaya Might want to look at the multivitamin, its got the vitamins you need no matter what age http://bit.ly/ciMHne
I'll take a few more questions then I've got to call it a day.  Anything about supplements or @allproscience
@ski8764 Anything for the fans, haha, twitter has been really cool for that, lets us keep in touch
@Ukraizian26 I was for a while, but I eat some meat now

@Msants7 Its good to have a mix, Grass fed whey is from animals, Veggie Protein isn't, we offer both
@Bradley_W_Parks Eat as much as you can, check out this article - http://bit.ly/bnRhsT

@NKA31 Core work in all forms from crunches to medicine ball work
@starchild793 Your body is really receptive for the :30 minutes after a workout.  Mixing up protein sources is a good idea
@BlackGreekGod Hopefully soon, realistically 6 months to a year.
@USAFHART Wild rice is really good stuff, you don't want super processed carbs, a lot of the nutrients are robbed that way
@Bender53 The artificial stuff in some other products isn't good for you long term,  APS is pure protein from clean sources
@MCAllisonMC You can always order to a friend in the US and drive it across yourself, haha
@PesoLoSo There might be, but I'm not aware of any.
@USAFHART Its not about weight loss, its about healthy active living.  If you eat right, your weight will be where it should be

Hey @allproscience customers, which flavor is your favorite? People are asking and I want your feedback
@dave_ethan You'll have to talk to your nutritionist, but I do know taking protein helps aid muscle recovery & growth
@Loyal_Dips APS 100% Grass Fed Whey + 3 days a week of weight lifting
@YafaSakkejha Its tough to be an athlete & vegan, you have to eat a lot, but eating natural foods is a good step for anyone
@AdamBianchi12 The APS multivitamin has 6mg of iron, all of the proteins are fortified as well http://bit.ly/ciMHne
@Joelocalpt It will have some natural energy boosters probably B12 & should be collegiate compliant
@1gameshyofglory I co-wrote a nutrition book with @nutritionexpert, Mitzi Dulan, you can follow her for more tips http://bit.ly/9skuqd
@JenReel Take some APS grass fed whey & mix it with oatmeal or grains.  Its thick but will bulk you up
@VictorPorunga Talk to your nutritionist first but it works for a lot of people if you take it wisely
@CentenoDiego A few cross fit gyms are selling APS, if you're interested, email customerservice@allproscience.com
@DerekWilson05 A banana is a really good pre workout snack
@Percules28 haha, protein, fish oil & multivitamin are the my top 3
@Beaglebozo I'm not vegan, I eat some meat, but sticking to any nutritional diet isn't tough if you believe in it
@Tha_Frank Its tough to cook & eat a piece of meat fast but easy to do a protein shake
@Tha_Frank A protein shake is good after a workout because its fast & easy.  You need the protein within :30 minutes
@SeanRobinson09 The best is the grass fed whey, to save 20% use the code "tweet88" thats a pretty good price for this kind of quality
Find out about new APS products, contests & promotions, join the APS Newsletter, I promise I won't spam you, haha http://bit.ly/aCKZys

@Joelocalpt APS is coming out with a pre workout soon, RECOVERY is great during & after
@DJ_Frisco Burning calories, take up jogging or play some pick up basketball, whatever you enjoy the most is what you'll stick to
@1gameshyofglory Just passing on knowledge that I've gotten from top nutritionists & has worked for me. Always consult your nutritionist
@cheryfair haha, thanks
@rw21md Without taking supps you'll need a lot of protein, eat some meat but also beans, nuts & eggs
@sturwold20 protein, a mass gainer or creatine all help build muscle mass
@Tha_Frank Most of that stuff isn't good for you, lots of artificial junk in it, stick to all natural, its more work but its worth it.
@ToMcVey_9 Best protein?  APS of course, haha, I like chocolate & strawberry
@OtavioRoichman Hows the weather down in Rio?  Make sure to train for both, keep a balance.  Protein helps fuel both strength & speed.
@alaj11 A pre-workout is good because it helps you work out harder and makes sure your body has what it needs heading into lifting
@jeffvietri RECOVERY is good if you were running, you need electrolytes & carbs, if you were just lifting, protein is fine
@JenReel Are you a good cook? haha, eat a lot, maybe take a weight gainer shake & lift weights 3-5 times per week
@ARCohen5 Somewhere between .5g/lb - 1g/lb every day would be good to start
@AntionetteG I take protein in the morning in a smoothie, then RECOVERY after I work out and another protein at night
@IN_Falcon We say 1g of protein per lb of body weight for very active athletes, anything from .5g/lb - 1g/lb is good for most
@Hekler21 haha, you've got to be more specific
@PiketYJ You can mix juices & fruit with our protein powders to make a smoothie, I don't believe we have any pills, only capsules
@ProInterviews Haven't heard of E2 diet, but its good to eat things that look like they do when it came out of the ground
@AdamAnimal5 Always talk to your nutritionist about what you take, but I know creatine works for some people
@KingDex1120 A mass gainer is good, they have protein, carbs & calories.  APS has an all natural one coming out soon
I'm answering questions about supplements, nutrition & @allproscience today.  Ask away
@IN_Falcon Coffee & protein? Thats new to me, but hey whatever works for you, haha
@RobertHayes33 Along with working out, take protein by itself, it helps sustain muscle but is low calorie
@drosales43 Creatine can help if you use it right, protein is good as well
@h_rod I gave up meat for a while, but now I eat some, mostly fish & chicken & only pure stuff, free range, wild fish etc
@theformulaco This is the best way to get started, its got one of everything http://bit.ly/95NUJR

@CMinor1974 Haha, if you order a copy of my book from APS it comes signed, I signed a bunch before I left for season.

@AMW1angel Great, mention you heard about APS on twitter and I'll have the guys in the warehouse throw in something extra in your package
@andylanders41 Try Veggie Protein from APS. Its low in calories & sugar but still 23g of protein, will help get you lean muscle.
@StephenByrd35 Don't forget to use the code "tweet88" to save your 20% bud
@hibbstim Anyone that drinks milk can take APS protein, there is nothing strange in it, just protein taken from grass fed cows
@OhYeahImLou You'll probably have to bump up the workout routine, we'll have a natural creatine out soon that might be good as well
@stricken721 Yes, APS is a supplement which goes along well with a new workout plan & its the best quality you can get
@JoeyInDC Good idea, we might have to look into that
@wcrtchicago No, I'm not a vegetarian, I eat some meat but when I do its quality stuff from pure sources
@MVPFF haha, who is they, I co-founded APS, It it isn't an endorsement deal, its my product & what I believe in
@Hitmanpicks email customerservice@allproscience.com your resume and they'll take a look, I know they're looking for an intern
@bigeviljb Here is a good meal replacement, 1 scoop of oatmeal, 1 scoop of APS protein, 1 cup of warm water.  Good, quick & healthy.
@FalconsJano Definitely good afterwards, what you drink before is up to you, its whatever you wont throw up, haha, 26 miles is too far
@andylanders41 Usually 3-5 business days, email customerservice@allproscience.com if its late, they'll help you out, good guys, haha
@StephenByrd35 RECOVERY has a good mix of protein, electrolytes & carbs, its good for during or after a run
Don't forget, I set up a code at www.allproscience.com for my twitter fans, save 20% by using "tweet88"
@StephenByrd35 Runners need protein too, not as much as a football player, you would probably do best with RECOVERY http://bit.ly/d0992W
@49ercarlos Quality, this report from Consumer Reports shows what bad stuff is in some other proteins http://bit.ly/bmnfPJ
@QCFatGirl Cardio & lifting low weight high reps are great ways to stimulate weight loss, also eating healthy foods & proper amounts
@radiophilbilly APS isn't a miracle, its just pure natural protein, you have to work hard but APS can help go that extra mile
@AyeYoChobbz Eat all the time, make sure its good food and work out, check out these tips http://bit.ly/bnRhsT
@TheRusCo If you have the $, the Ultimate Package is the way to go, it has my book (signed) & all of our products http://bit.ly/95NUJR
@StephenByrd35 Right now APS is available online at www.allproscience.com & in a few gyms, it should be in stores like Whole Foods in 2011
If you have any questions about nutrition, supplements or @allproscience shoot them my way & I'll do my best to answer
A lot of people have been asking me about @allproscience, I'm going to take some time today to answer questions about supplements
@cavsfan2123 Catch a lot of balls.  Every day after practice, catch 50 extra passes.  Stay late, put in the time and you will improve
@theformulaco You'll love them, which ones are you going to try?
I can't stand the blocking call in basketball. They should hardly ever call it unless it's just blatant.
@roddywhiteTV Best team is of course the World Champs.....Lakers!!
@roddywhiteTV hold on. The game is not over yet plus it's the first game. When they get that chemistry going they will b the 2nd best team.
Nate Robinson would have made a great running back.
Loved Labrons commercial. He's not a villain.
I hope Chris Bosh gets enough shots. With Wade and James it's going to be hard.
About to watch the game. If the Heat don't win how much of a letdown will it be?
Ok, yesterday I caught 3 Bass. A beautiful day on the lake. It was good to take a break.

We just have to keep getting better every week. I know that sounds boring but it's true.
Just got back to ATL. Great win for us today. Total team effort! Saints made it tough.
Game day! Best day of the week. Enjoy the games today.
What is the best motivational book you ever read that you would  recommend a high school kid?
@ATaylor400hKing Wasn't even close. I think 27-6.
@torressports CAL better bring it tonight if they are going to win. I have faith they can get it done!
That QB from Michigan is the real deal. I hope he's not seriously hurt. I think he might have a shot at the heisman.
Watching these college games in the hotel in NO. Ingram is a beast. Can't believe UCLA mopped Texas so bad.
@wcrtchicago no, just watched it on TV.
If Ali got passed the 1st 3 rounds he would have won BUT I don't think that would have happened. MT was the fastest,strongest, and meanest.
@wcrtchicago i enjoy arena football. It's a lot of fun to watch especially when guys get knocked into the stands.
In there primes who would have won... Mike Tyson or Ali? I'm going with Tyson.
@JanJanMan20 get 100 catches per practice.
@sturwold20 I like Vernon Davis. He's becoming a complete TE by blocking as well as catching. Jason Witten is a complete one too.
Just got off the field and about to get a massage! Can't wait! Oh yea practice went well.
For this week I'm giving away game worn gear from the #Saints v #Falcons game. http://twitpic.com/2pcd21
Did anyone catch the new show Undercovers last night? I thought it was pretty good. what did you think?
If you're feeling sore after practice, APS all natural Relief roll on was made for you http://bit.ly/dd1cXt
Man it was hot again in the ATL. Practice went well anyway. Hopefully it will help us focus better for the game.
Remember... I have myself on my FF team haha!
To all the FF players out there with me on there team. Catches will come sooner or later but as long as we win that's good enough for me.
@DJC20 haha. I know it seems that way but believe it or not I have been blocking really well. catches will come.
@FRANKTRIGG good to catch up. Looks like you were good luck!
@redbone444 jumping rope works the whole body at one time and helps with coordination. Only other cardio I do is play ball.
@SuperJusticeMan I'm happy for the chiefs. Wouldn't it be great if we played them in the Super Bowl haha!
@DingmanGroup Ask for Greg. He will be able to take care of what ever you need.
@rockchalk717 stay away from processed foods, sodas, and fast food as much as u can. AND make sure u exercise! You'll do great.
Man it's hot in the ATL! Practice was tough but we got through it. It should be a good one this week against the Saints.

@redbone444 cedar planks are the best way to cook salmon. You can get them everywhere.

Wow! I didn't think they would take away Reggie's trophy. He had to PLAY to get it. I think a stiff fine would have worked. Thoughts?

@Im_ThickE She will! Shoot, she already is!! Haha!
