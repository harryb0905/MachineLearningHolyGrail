Cool! You’ve found a way to hate on (proven to work) laws AND brown people. What kind of society do you want to live in? I don’t need an answer to that question. It’s for you to ask yourself. https://t.co/gflSLgNBI2
So your argument is that good faith attempts to curtail bad behavior (i.e. laws/regulations) are useless because some will act in bad faith anyway so why have laws? That is a bad faith approach to civilization. The whole shebang runs on good faith!! That’s why it needs our care. https://t.co/Xp1GbQBVGW

I'm sure the issue was the spacing. Frankly, it was kinda amazing to stand so close to something so unstable, yet predictable.  #MythBustersJr
In the end it didn't take more than a few pounds of force to get the last domino to go. It was SO ON THE EDGE of being able to stay upright.  #MythBustersJr
The setting up of the big dominoes took SO LONG. #MythBustersJr
With an exponential demolition like this you can choose your parameters. The Juniors chose to play at the edge of possibility, such that the careful and sensitive setting of the proper distance between dominoes was CRITICAL, a skill that Cannan was the most proficient at.
For the record, I haven’t checked whether I actually have dismemberment insurance. I mean, if I lost a foot, I'd kinda like to make my own. Ditto for a hand. I'm not sure if the policy would cover THAT.  #MythBustersJr

We were blown away by all of their professionalism. Amazing job, @valerie_mbj @RobotMakerGirl  @jesse_lawlesss @NotABombBunkE @braintwist2112 and Cannan. #MythBustersJr
This was the 1st episode to film, and the kids did GREAT. It's so hard for a kid to just be a kid, let alone w/4 cameras pointed at them, but we knew the story we wanted to tell was one about their experience of what we were doing, and they showed up ready to play. #MythBustersJr https://t.co/vrfaXmEsAx
I’ve seen some Tweets by people saying there’s no way the Demolition Dominoes myth wouldn’t be confirmed. But I didn’t feel that way. #MythBustersJr
It’s never not fun to crush a car (on purpose). #MythbustersJr https://t.co/1FEk6F40iK
I was blown away by how many words one could write with a pencil (over 80K from a real pencil if memory serves). You don't often come across a myth where the reality is so much better than the story. #MythBustersJr
Just dropping a glass of water on the ground and watching it break using my phone's slo-mo camera is thrilling. I LOVE high speed shots. And I love time-lapse footage almost as much.  #MythBustersJr
I am SO often surprised by what I see in the high-speeds that I didn’t catch at the time with my eyes. It's always illuminating to see things slowed down. I've learned so much about material science from witnessing our high speeds.  #MythBustersJr
I can't remember the first @MythBusters story we used this quick release on, but we've dropped hundreds of thousands of pounds from that puppy.  #MythBustersJr
The quick release we’re using here is actually built for safely dropping things in film. It's an industry piece of equipment, which makes it ideal for us: robust, easy to set, easy to strip down, simple operation. #MythBustersJr
On the set. #MythBustersJr https://t.co/y7uGAcQKgn
@KrisRussell26 Yes! Explosions, crashed cars and everything you’d expect from MythBusters.
@EvanAndKatelyn @ScienceChannel Biggest hurdle, hmmm. That’s tough. Frankly it was juggling #MythBustersJr and @testedcom at the same time. It took some figuring to make sure each was properly served.
As some of you know, I prefer to sketch in pencil. My favorite is the PaperMate Sharpwriter #2. I love those things. I know that offends a lot of pencil geeks out there. I'm sorry, but my tastes in mechanical pencils is simple. #MythBustersJr
@TigerMike83 @MythBusters We started filming in June, and wrapped at the end of August!
The pencil myth has been on my list forever. I love the whole concept. I wanted to do this during the original @MythButers but we never got around to it. #MythBustersJr
This high-speed was AMAZING. The Slinky really does seem to defy gravity even when you film it on your phone. It's uncanny. #MythBustersJr
Also we only had wooden stairs (not carpeted) in my house growing up, and Slinkys aren’t the best on slippery surfaces. But of course I had to have one. #MythBustersJr
I had a Slinky as a kid, although I handed it to my friend for a second and they tied it up in knots. #MythBustersJr

Well, thanks, everyone, for joining me tonight! Hope you enjoyed the episode. If you missed it, it re-airs at 9 pm PT on @ScienceChannel  and Saturday at noon on @Discovery! #MythBustersJr
What a treat this was! We were all glowing like bass drums with lights inside.  #MythBustersJr
OK. Mind = blown. You go through all the possible scenarios in your head and you try and make every allowance for variance you can, and to eliminate any variance where possible, but you NEVER EVER EVER get it on the first try. #MythBustersJr
While we were dialing in the crossbow rig, you’ll see in the #MythBustersJr episode that I was filming the test on my phone. Here’s that video. https://t.co/RmtNNA476I
Please please don't throw your batteries in the trash. If we've made a proper PSA that keeps people from doing that then I've done my job. #MythBustersJr
The smell of burning trash was pretty gross. #MythBustersJr
On the other hand, I’d always wanted to get inside a garbage truck and see how it works from the inside, so that was a treat. #MythBustersJr
Rooting through this garbage was as disgusting as it looked. Reminded me of when we doing the Dumpster Diving myth and the first dumpster we checked out at the dump (the first one I jumped into) was full of medical waste. Gross! #MuthBustersJr
By the way, my coat of arms from tonight’s #MythBustersJr now proudly hangs in my cave! https://t.co/f84zVkmsTs

For those asking, here’s a link to Simone’s Got Problems (https://t.co/GozlyTfvVS)
I  kept most of my archery equipment from @MythBusters. But I don't get to shoot very often. #MythBustersJr
I love archery. I set myself up with a nice compound bow while we were filming @SimoneGiertz’s Simone’s Got Problems (which I executive produced) and have always loved it. #MythBustersJr
Seeing a lithium battery ignite like this was terrifying. #MythBustersJr
Byron Ferguson was AMAZING. I hadn't worked directly with him before, but what a craftsman he was! #MythBustersJr
I’ve seen a lot of Twitter comments re: “Straight as an Arrow” referring to the arrow, not the path. I’ve always thought of the phrase as the flight. #MythBustersJr
Do not throw your batteries in the trash!

Good morning! Please look up and listen to an amazing song: The Mother, by @brandicarlile. I’ve been listening to it on repeat for days. “From inside of the ages of your eyes”chokes me up every time. Thank you for what feels like a proper modern protest song.
Thanks Matt! https://t.co/Gmu3WBAPBI
Amateurs. https://t.co/S6KeoocfAG
Confirmed entirely. https://t.co/ynfMtitE55
Whatever the etymology is, the fact remains that said tape is SHITE on ducts. Absolutely useless against the duct. It’s akin to realizing you could never hurt a dragon, and subsequently calling yourself DRAGONKILLER. https://t.co/jYTAmeijng
Shhhhhh https://t.co/9qItMWKdxW
Okay, that was so much fun. I'm so glad you all liked what we made together this past summer. My new mythbusting colleagues are now part of a grand tradition. Empirical knowledge can save the planet. All love and hugs to everyone. Off to dinner with Thing1. xoxoxox MBJr rocks!
As for the duct tape tires, I had very high hopes and … OK, I won’t reveal these results either. Let’s just say I was surprised by those too, but for a different reason. #MythBustersJr
The duct tape parachute results TOTALLY surprised me. I won’t reveal what they are, for those of you haven’t seen the #MythBustersJR: Duct Tape Special yet, but … let me know if you were surprised too.
Ten episodes in this season. If it does well I'm hoping we'll film another 10 this summer!! Tell everyone! https://t.co/KhnJPOYS5a

Driving like this again for #MythBustersJr was SO. MUCH. FUN. I'm pretty highly trained at this point and I don't get a lot of opportunity to test myself. Lovely to be back in the saddle, doing crazy shit with cars for camera.
Drifting on duct tape tires was EVERY BIT AS MUCH FUN as it looked. https://t.co/M9AxS7pvjv

@midnight_techsc The. Best. Crew.
The OG buster was a pile of burnt chunks at the end of filming MB. We gave every crew member a plastic box with a burnt, blown up camera and chunks of buster in it. https://t.co/oXb7ELnKQY

Cannan did SO well for a first-time driver. He gave over to the absurdity of learning to drive on a closed course on duct tape wheels and had a great time. #MythBustersJr
Yep. Made locally here in CA by the fine folks at @RideOnewheel. I've cumulatively put over 1500 miles on mine over the past few years. https://t.co/fN1tvoVm8X
Correction, buster does NOT qualify for hazard pay. No sentience. Turns out to be a requirement. https://t.co/e8XocicJnq
@WhatIsAClayton Buster's sport is called EXTREME METHODOLOGY.
It was the BEST FEELING to be back at Alameda. It was so fun to take the #MythBustersJr kids to our old stomping ground and let them experience it for themselves. Also much of our crew were original #MythBusters crew so that was also awesome. https://t.co/oqxxdQpZf4
These six young Mythbusters are so kind, so engaged, they inspired me every day. https://t.co/FuAhPudJ3O
Yay! Make a duct tape boat with them! https://t.co/Z48N4f03Hc
@InfectedMusic91 My question exactly.
If I had to pick a favorite duct tape myth, it would be the boats. I enjoy so much making boats out of the stuff and testing them on the water. #MythBustersJr
I was very happy to see Buster again. However, I'm not so sure he was happy to see me. #MythBustersJr https://t.co/KGOVlo6NOf
Thank you. It's nice to be back. (I was never very far away) https://t.co/uM27oE9SEZ
#MythBustersJr producer Jax came up with duct tape parachute and I was frankly a little astounded that two such awesome duct tape stories were out there just waiting…
Yay @Glitch community! Thanks for joining in on the fun! https://t.co/GiQ2VQx8DK
It was AMAZING to work with duct tape again on #MythBustersJr. I thought we'd done all the myths possible with duct tape on #MythBusters until I caught an article on @Jalopnik about duct tape tires and knew I'd never be happy until I saw it tested.
I was happy to put away #MythBusters in 2016. I'm proud of what we all made together, and after so long, I was tired. But when I heard the idea for #MythBustersJr I was hooked. I loved the idea of a not-a-kids-show starring kids about science and methodology.
Time to turn on #MythBustersJr on @ScienceChannel right NOW! I’ll be tweeting live throughout the broadcast. So exciting!
It’s 2019, so OF COURSE I needed the blimp from #BladeRunner, which I couldn’t have done without @KayteSabicer or @roboterkampf’s kit! Check it out. https://t.co/ZEHxUFkam9
.@PopMech gets it! #MythBustersJr has kids, but it isn’t specifically a kids show, any more than #MythBusters was. https://t.co/Qa4qfIaYmc
SO EXCITED FOR TONIGHT! And if you plan to watch #MythBustersJr tonight I’ll be Tweeting live during the premiere at 9 pm ET on @ScienceChannel! https://t.co/BtFDYKel7B

I’m in awe of all the amazing women, people of color, and of such varied faiths and beliefs who worked so tirelessly to make tonight’s victories possible. This is the America I want to live in.  There’s NO place for white supremacy in this melting pot. G’night all. Xoxox
Ate dinner tonite with some of my great WETA friends in Wellington, replete with great stories, laughter, and terrific food. Rejuvenated i return to my hotel to read such excellent results of today’s election. To ALL who waited to vote, I thank you and I love you. Let’s rebuild!!
I’m not saying I can think of how it makes me vulnerable. Just that it feels like a bad idea so I don’t make that info available. https://t.co/heduPzd7NU

Well once I held your beautiful creation it screamed out for something substantial. What magic spell did you cast to get such a full tone from such a small instrument? I very much enjoyed playing it while it was briefly in my possession. We will post a vid of the build soon. https://t.co/GUSZwyVYwd

Note, I’m not AT ALL saying that republican (or conservative) voters are guilty of those things. Nope. I’m saying that the PARTY is demonstrably, factually, and consistently guilty of those things. Xo!
Of course we will. Pretty much only one party inspires horrifying acts of violence, is openly racist, lies outright constantly &amp; it ain’t mine (i know i know all politicians lie, but if you think there’s ANY equivalence you’re not paying attention) but thanks for the advice. https://t.co/q0DxkK4IdV

@LordDragoZac @donaldkoenig @smittyhalibut @JayFloersch Don, stop, he’s arguing in bad faith.
Dammit. I proof read and then autocorrect changed a bunch and i missed that. Yes, NIXON and his people invented the war on drugs to SILENCE the voice of POC and anti-war activists. Tell THAT to conservatives who claim racism  is a myth. BUSTED. https://t.co/5EG2aGAoKr

Jeremiah I’m assuming you’re speaking in good faith, so I’ll respond in kind. Right now, at this moment in time, we need you to spend “a few seconds in a voting booth”. And also to do the things you think will make the world better. Do both! All love. https://t.co/bH0uPyqllM

The immigrants aren’t coming for your jobs. The caravan is not an invasion. The phrase Black Lives Matter specifically means all lives matter. When you yell ALL LIVES MATTER! what you’re really saying is THE STATUS QUO THAT BENEFITS ME MATTERS. Vote vote vote vote vote vote vote.

@Whatnot6 @RobotMakerGirl The cultures are different. But the ppl in those two cultures are both simply makers. There’s somewhat of a tendency to think of crafting as the poor relative to making. Those value distinctions ill-serve us, and I bristle at ppl feeling like they aren’t good enough to join in.

There are plenty of conservative political ideas that are totally worth discussing. I don’t hate conservatives.

Last word: over the past few days “WILLFULLY IGNORANT” has given me so much more pleasure to write than “idiot”. More precise, exact, and it has inherent faith in the power of change. In every way I like it more. It’s far from a concession. It’s a bonus. I’m done. All love! https://t.co/6oaSAmhAjs

Truth. We all gonna die with a full to-do list. Yet if I can ease someone else’s experience even a little, it’s worth the expenditure. Of course it’s a case by case basis, and this is one of my cases. We all have to work past the privilege of ignoring the marginalized. https://t.co/mrhocarOGx

I thought this thought: do I want a kid who can clearly see that some people in the world are smarter than them to feel “less than”? No. I really don’t. Because intelligence is just one of an infinite tapestry of human qualities. https://t.co/8pnIAFv5xV
To those making a “slippery slope” argument to me. I willingly  and gleefully choose my words in the world carefully to cause least harm. At the same time Mrs Donttrythis &amp; I share wildly inappropriate humor with each other in private. https://t.co/6oaSAmhAjs
Right, but here’s the thing. I used a word meaning “less intelligent” as an insult. Do I hate the less intelligent? Goodness no. Why would I when I know so many ppl smarter than I. So I opted for exactitude in place of Ad Hoc insult. https://t.co/NmI4PpBoHt
I decided to start using it recently  in place of “idiot”;  someone pointed out that word is ableist. I love the word idiot but couldn’t refute their point in good faith. So now I say the more accurate “willfully ignorant”. https://t.co/8WSOSDfGEE
By all means! https://t.co/HONBlFvhMs

Ahhhh. I find few things more relaxing than regarding a nicely decked out Bridgeport mill. https://t.co/aXhVSilxQ3

I was so sad when that tape recorder fell out. https://t.co/pMaCX3IKTf
My wife and I are enjoying a throwback Saturday night listening to JOAN ARMATRADING and being gobsmacked how incredible her music is, and how young we were when we first found her.

Maybe this tweet will get me fired in ten years. For being dumb. https://t.co/zwgL4KOeCc
Whups. I boned the punchline. Ugh. https://t.co/DJSDQPlfpB
Just put down the regulator and we’ll act like nothing happened. https://t.co/9oOoaOaAJ8
The old joke was rush Limbaugh, but it fits POTUS much better. What’s the difference between the Hindenburg and POTUS? One is a flaming Nazi gasbag disaster. The other is (sadly, hopefully temporarily) president. https://t.co/EijTAwj6Ri
Literally my favorite loop ever. https://t.co/CySKtIjjOn
Are you guys going through all the helium today? Make sure to stop before your lips are blue (don’t ask me how I know that ) https://t.co/RJVzx4i7IJ
I love you guys. I’ll text you my dancing monkey video later tonight. https://t.co/kcWXwEW98j

Hey this is just to remind everyone that our democracy is literally crumbling in favor of autocracy &amp; fascism and that our criminal-in-chief and the GOP establishment are carving up the spoils. This is an emergency. If you support them YOU ARE ON the WRONG SIDE.
Well there’s also the fact that from the vantage point of a parent, big is a HORRIFYING movie. https://t.co/Z4iqWXv72V
Read this. Horrifying. Disgusting actually. https://t.co/tVGQs5LRmj
(PS, for those who don’t know, it’s the main panel of the Apollo 11 Command Module.)
Love this! And you can get it as a shower curtain from Luna Replicas too. #notsponsored https://t.co/aa9xJHvPpe

#ShareYourRejection In 1995 I applied for a job to build, install and unveil traveling exhibits for @exploratorium. They turned me down, but with regard to my resume they paid me this high compliment: “In the words of the immortal Bruce Lee, your work is very dangerous, sir.”
Oh god this is the WORST. I’ve yet to figure out what to say to achieve any substantive results. Telling then I’m not feeling well helps for a little while. My wife has experienced that the very drivers that do this often dislike being asked by women to change how they drive. https://t.co/jKgh2UfC8x

Yes but still. Be careful with the individuals themselves. We are all more delicate than would seem at first glance. https://t.co/Rvg0VwQsXq
Off the cuff I’d say probably, but you should remember you can have no idea about the true and deep suffering of others and what they’ve gone through just to be a human being. Judge the cult by all means, but be careful with the individuals. https://t.co/EjhYoL2pLw
Hey tweeps, calling someone “gullible” simply because of their religious beliefs is ignorant and narrow minded. That feeling of superiority it gives you? You might want to check that.
How do you reconcile your Christianity with POTUS’ behavior? He demonstrably despises the poor, the downtrodden, the needy, and without a doubt, the brown. I might be agnostic but I‘m pretty sure Jesus would be on my side of this debate. Not a rhetorical question. https://t.co/I9EFJlAuZ0
