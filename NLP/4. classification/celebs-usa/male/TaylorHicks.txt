You have meteorological drought syndrome James.  It’s been undiagnosed for years. We’ve all watched it get progressively worse. We are glad we are above average rain fall right now. We love you and we are here for you. https://t.co/AyMu04tkF5

Interesting turn in the #JussieSmollet case. Something didn’t add up imo. If it is staged publicity stunt, he should be jailed. For someone that’s in the business and tries to let the work garner press, it’s sad what people have to do to get their name out there.

Great article by Mary Colurso!  https://t.co/fkBDDJF0dO
Last one @United. Here’s the cherry on top. My bags made the earlier flight. And to all a good night America.
#callpaul https://t.co/H6bNZTAquq
Here is my take @united. I’m cool about this. I don’t really want to talk to anyone else. If I did I would have to tell a crazy Paula Abdul story on Idol. If any flight is over 6 hours delayed. One should have the option of a hotel. 3 hours should be the max.
It’s snowing like a bitch in  #chi-town.
@united didn’t bother to tell me there was a later flight to nashville? Ran to gate. Wtf. There is little to no communication about other options to travel.
The repetitive cadence in country music is played the f@#$ out. Just sayin. Let’s get creative again people.
@united now 4 hours. Avoid #ohare like the plague in the winter.
It’s cool @united. @Delta would have done it for me wouldn’t you have @Delta? 😳
@united 3 hour delay. How bout a @united club pass? #unitedclub are the best😉😉😉😉😉

@JohnHayes730 play the whole video of #devinwhite. White hits him then stands over him.  A hit around the head and upper shoulders on a player is a late hit. Standing over the defenseless player after the hit is taunting. From the replay booth (late hit +taunting =targeting).

The death sentence. https://t.co/KX14MSMdUi
I think we ought to start mobilizing some military.
@finebaum @JohnHayes730 If everyone actually sees the whole play after the hit which imo was late and up around the helmet and shoulder pad (late hit) #DevinWhite stood over the qb after the play taunting.   Late hit+taunting=targeting
@Ravens soft. Get a a qb that likes to play not has to play. Out coached.
I have no faith in Joe Flacco.  No fire in the gut.
@leefitting @CollegeGameDay  The best game day show and storylines I’ve ever seen.  Great television. Had me in tears. #TylerStong
Oh yea. Forgot.  What a story in #Purdue last night.  #TylerStong  That’s what college sports is all about folks. #OSUvsPUR
Might😳?  Bring it. https://t.co/1ny5E3ETek
So that means we all should be prepared to follow @spann for the latest winter updates and to follow all the northwest forecasters to see if it’s actually gonna snow in the mountain region and northwest. #Propaganda 🙄😂😂 https://t.co/crdzAcksT5
Me too. https://t.co/zeeRGQfdA0
This is why I believe he will succeed.  Second half adjustments in this league separate the men from the boys imo. It’s why the SEC has had success in bowl games. Minus Ohio State they are on par. https://t.co/WblaJbCfBD

I really enjoyed my sleep on my red eye flights last night on @AmericanAir. The recline allowed for a good nights rest unlike your new 300 series aircraft. Why y’all skimping??? Hmm.. @wesheavner your right #conciergekey https://t.co/Fk5UwyFdR9
This is a big one @delta. https://t.co/Fk5UwyFdR9
@Delta we have a problem.
Hell yes!! https://t.co/W5rtY5ft36
@wesheavner No D. The only thing asleep are these defenses.
The #RedRiverShowdown is a powderpuff game.  This is arguably the weakest conference in college football. Where did the defense go in this league? It’s a joke.

Not only does Alabama have the best offense in college football, they also adjust very well in the second half of games. You know who else adjusts well? Coach O and the #LSUTigers.
Biggest bet of the year to date. 2 half team total over 10 and the hook Washington St. 😎 https://t.co/lGvQueZC7D

#SEC. who the hell decided #Washington was a top ten team?
This game is over.  #WASHvsAUB
#Washington is overrated and slow. Why they are in the top ten is all politics to drive tickets. These pre season polls are designed to drive the dollar 💵.

#SEC speed. https://t.co/UyTEsBKNj1
The #Huskies are a joke and overrated.
Northwest football does not have chance against the #SECNation. #Washington will get waxed just like they did against #Bama. Wde.
