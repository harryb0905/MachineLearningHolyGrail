We actually don't do that (look at another channel to determine topics)..  and I do ask people on Social Media (Facebook/ Twitter) what they would like to us to discuss all the time.  What would you like us to discuss on the panel tonight Joel? https://t.co/9zQMlzqIlS

2/2.  We beat the next net by 45 mins -our data was better &amp; the decision desk guys were confident- never waivered.

I know of no network that would wait until all the polls were closed to make a control of Congress call.  That would be a 1am call.  Just like Presidential elections when one candidate is projected to get 270 electoral votes.  We call it.   1 of 2. https://t.co/vfU6cnr4dj

The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley will oust two-term Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill in one of the most closely watched races in the country. https://t.co/TaWK5PE3xM
In the Oregon gubernatorial race, it is too early to say whether incumbent Democratic Governor Kate Brown will stave off a challenge from Republican Knute Buehler, a state lawmaker.
Fox can also project that Hawaii Governor David Ige, a Democrat, will win a second term by defeating Republican Andria Tupola.
The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Idaho Lieutenant Governor Brad Little, a Republican, will defeat Democrat Paulette Jordan in the race to succeed retiring GOP Governor Butch Otter.
In Washington state, incumbent Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell will win a fourth term by defeating Republican Susan Hutchinson.
Another Democrat on that committee, Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono, will also win reelection tonight by defeating Republican challenger Ron Curtis, according to the Fox News Decision Desk.
Fox can also project that California Senator Dianne Feinstein will defeat state senator Kevin de Leon, a fellow Democrat who had placed second to Feinstein in the state‚Äôs non-partisan ‚Äújungle‚Äù primary in June.
The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will defeat Republican John Cox in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic incumbent Governor Jerry Brown.
Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Democrat Andrew Gillum will fall short in his bid to become Florida‚Äôs first African-American governor, losing to Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis https://t.co/jxvj7kC6RY
The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Republican Senator Ted Cruz will win a second term by defeating Democratic Congressman Beto O‚ÄôRourke in the most expensive Senate race in American history. The Republicans will retain control of the Senate https://t.co/c6V0MlZ0G8
colleague @ChrisStirewalt joins us to explain why @FoxNews made the call for the house #foxnews #Midterms2018 https://t.co/KBdahLKB03
Democratic state senator Laura Kelly tonight will beat GOP Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who in August defeated Governor Jeff Colyer in the Republican primary. So Democrats score another gubernatorial pickup tonight, this one in Kansas. https://t.co/wG7JJ80hti
Fox can now project that Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer will unseat one-term Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp, scoring a crucial Senate pickup for the GOP.
The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that former Republican presidential nominee @MittRomney will defeat Democrat Jenny Wilson to succeed retiring GOP Senator Orrin Hatch. #FoxNews https://t.co/uvO5zoUvH7

The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, dealing a major setback to President Trump‚Äôs legislative agenda
Fox News can now project that Republican Vermont Governor Phil Scott will defeat Democratic challenger Christine Hallquist.
In Oklahoma, businessman Kevin Stitt will succeed term-limited Governor Mary Fallin, a fellow Republican, by defeating Democratic lawyer Drew Edmondson.
We have another major race call to make in the Tennessee Senate race: The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen to replace retiring GOP Senator Bob Corker.
We have a major race call to make in New Jersey: The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that Democratic Senator Robert Menendez will win reelection by defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin.
Rick Scott advisor says ‚Äúit will be very close‚Äù &amp; to keep an eye on Okaloosa County, which is in the panhandle. The results there just started to come in.  #FoxNews
It is now 8:30 on the East Coast and 7:30 in Arkansas, where polls have just closed and Fox can now project that incumbent Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson will defeat Democratic challenger Jared Henderson.
The Fox News Decision Desk can now project that incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, as expected, will win a third term by defeating Republican Congressman Jim Renacci.
In Massachusetts, Republican Governor Charlie Baker will win a second term by defeating Democrat Jay Gonzalez.  In Alabama, Republican Governor Kay Ivey will win election to a first full term by defeating Democrat Walter Maddox, the mayor of Tuscaloosa.
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf will win a second term by defeating Republican businessman Scott Wagner. In Maryland, Republican Governor Larry Hogan will win a second term by defeating Democrat Ben Jealous, the former president of the NAACP.
In MS, Republican Senator Roger Wicker will win reelection to a second full term by defeating Democratic state lawmaker David Baria. In TN businessman Bill Lee will succeed Governor Bill Haslam, a fellow Republican, by defeating Democrat Karl Dean, former mayor of Nashville.
In Delaware, Democratic Senator Tom Carper will win a fourth term by defeating GOP businessman Rob Arlett. In Maine, Independent Senator Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, will win a second term by beating Republican state senator Eric Brakey.
In Rhode Island, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse will win a third term by beating GOP attorney Bob Flanders. In Maryland, Democratic Senator Ben Cardin will win a third term by defeating Republican educator Tony Campbell.
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Senator Bob Casey will win a third term by defeating Republican Congressman Lou Barletta &amp; In Connecticut, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy will win a second term by defeating Republican Matthew Corey.
Unsurprisingly, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat, will win a second term in Massachusetts, although she is already considering a presidential run in 2020. Warren defeats Republican Geoff Diehl, a state lawmaker.
There‚Äôs the special Senate election in MS, which may not even be settled tonight. That‚Äôs because no fewer than 4 candidates are competing in a ‚Äújungle‚Äù primary. If no candidate receives more than 50% of vote tonight, then the top 2finishers will advance to runoff election Nov27
It is also too soon to call the Senate race in New Jersey, where incumbent Democratic Senator Robert Menendez is vying with Republican businessman Bob Hugin.
And speaking of running for the Senate, Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee currently has a lead over Democrat Phil Bredesen, a former governor, to replace retiring GOP Senator Bob Corker. But it is too soon to project a winner in that race.
Also in Florida, it is too early to say whether Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, will defeat Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis to replace term-limited GOP Governor Rick Scott, who, as we mentioned, is running for the Senate.
Another opportunity for a Republican pickup is in Florida, where Republican Governor Rick Scott is trying to oust Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson. The Fox News Decision Desk does not yet have enough data to project a winner in that race.
One of the closest Senate races has been in MO, where Democratic incumbent McCaskill is battling Republican challenger Hawley, the state‚Äôs AG. While it‚Äôs too early to project a winner, a victory by Hawley would give Republicans a crucial pickup in the Senate
It‚Äôs 8 o‚Äôclock on the East Coast and polls have just closed in 16 more states (as well as DC), including 5 w/ highly competitive elections that will help determine control of the Senate ‚Äì MO, TN, NJ, MS, FLO (which also has a crucial gubernatorial election).
* Poll hours have been extended Tuesday for 3 locations in Gwinnett County, Georgia, where voting machines malfunctioned earlier on Tuesday. #Midterms2018
per @pdoocy: We are told a ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù Gov Scott has arrived at the La Playa hotel and golf resort in Naples, and is in his room watching TV and checking the internet for updates about the race with the First Lady of Florida and multiple grandkids.
Also in Ohio, the Democrat who succeeded DeWine in the Senate 12 years ago, Sherrod Brown, is currently ahead of his Republican challenger, Congressman Jim Renacci, although Fox is not yet ready to make a projection.
In OH gubernatorial race, former Republican Senator DeWine is locked in a very tight race with DemRichard Cordray, who served as President Obama‚Äôs first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We do not yet have enough data to project a winner in this race
It‚Äôs 7:30 and polls have just closed in three more states, including two of national interest in this election, WV &amp; OH. In WV, Senator Manchin is trying to fend off a challenge by Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. It is too early to declare a winner in that race.
It remains unclear... https://t.co/1rGNXpN9wo
We have @@BillHemmer at the @FoxNews big board tonight-- #Midterms2018 https://t.co/P5uk8OjLl4
Remember, the two overarching questions of the night are whether Democrats can take control of the House and whether Republicans can keep control of the Senate. It is of course too early to make those all-important projections.
We can also now project that Republican South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster will win his race against Democrat James Smith.
Clinton‚Äôs running mate in 2016, Democratic Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, will win a second term tonight by beating Republican challenger Corey Stewart, according to our Fox News Voter Analysis
Fox News Decision Desk can project that independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, will easily win a third term by defeating Republican Lawrence Zupan
In Indiana, incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly is trying to stave off a challenge from Republican businessman Mike Braun. That race is very close at the moment, so it‚Äôs too early to declare a winner.
In GA, Democrat Stacey Abrams, vying to become the first African-American female governor in U.S. history, is locked in a tight race with Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. It is too early to say who will win that contest to succeed term-limited GOP Governor Nathan Deal.
It‚Äôs 7 o‚Äôclock on the East Coast and polls have just closed in half a dozen states,  @FoxNews Decision Desk can now begin to project winners/ losers in crucial elections across the country. 2 most closely watched races at this hour are the Indiana Senate /Georgia gubernatorial
Pouring rain in #Florida‚Äî @AndrewGillum campaign had to move indoors. #foxnews https://t.co/o08rKjMNvP
Per GA Secretary of State Spox Candice Broce: High voter turnout across the state w/ minimal issues. 2 voting locations granted judicial extensions.1 for 9 mins in Fannin County/1  Gwinnett County for 29 mins due to difficulties getting all equipment running on time this morning
Bloomington in Monroe County Indiana, home to Indiana University - county that Trump/Pence lost by 23% in 2016 ran out of ballots. Caused delays - voting has been extended there by an hour to compensate #Midterms2018
