Worked w/ Stubby Kaye (w/Brando below) just before doing G&amp;D on B'way &amp; told him I was playing Sky in a new revival. He said: "Oh, Pete, that's a great! A friend of mine played Sky a few years ago. He wore a light blue hat and a light blue suit.....Don't do that!" And I didn't :) https://t.co/Pwjqp2Qp4w

@levisharpe @madeleine_rae @forzaquattro77 @peretti Oops,  you win. Sorry and thanks for the education.
@levisharpe @madeleine_rae @forzaquattro77 @peretti He was gracious.  He used the right pic  - of a  character in American Beauty that I based on Trump - the wig (Cary Grant's :), the weight, the profound, myopic self admiration. Unions aren't perfect but catastrophic wealth inequality is no picnic either. Cheers!
@levisharpe @madeleine_rae @Hail_Car_King @forzaquattro77 @peretti I love Unions..I'm a member of several...why is this guy using my picture?
@DebbieLemieux10 OMG! Hello and thanks Debbie. That was so long ago I've been wondering if it happened - thanks for the confirmation. Sending all good wishes. Go Jumbos!
@MutantRejects @brghtidea @TheGiftedonFOX Best to you all!
@bshanleyjr I loved making that film. Probably the best film role I've ever had. Michelle Pfeiffer was just as you would hope. Lovely and talented.

Maybe if I put a little live show together  it might be a good song for now - maybe I'll lose the mascara and satin-or maybe not? Written by Jeff Barry.

@soultruth1 @coenbroscharac @CoenBros Thanks Jennifer - not at the moment. The last one was a B'way cast album of On The Twentieth Century - which is really different. lol. I'll let you know!
@soultruth1 @coenbroscharac @CoenBros That's who I was trying to do. Memories Are Made of This was a big Dean Martin hit - He was my earliest inspiration and I used to do  impressions of him when I was about 8 to anyone who would listen. - never met him tho.
@MutantRejects @brghtidea @TheGiftedonFOX Thanks, Dom - don't let me stop you. My hope was that kids who feel targeted by hate would see that it's not really about them. Someone who spews hate does it to get a lot of money and power and they don't care who they hurt - as long as it's not themselves.
Thanks Fred! Directed by John Badham and also starred  two treasures @AudraEqualityMc and @DMurphyOfficial. On our first day of rehearsal Garner said: "here I am, a kid from Norman, OK and about to start another picture at 72 - ain't life grand!". He was awesome - I miss him too https://t.co/SI1khgzkjE

@thoreau_devotee @geisha59 @JohnJHarwood I made a mistake in the transcription of my mom's poem...It should have read: "My world will be tumultuous with you no longer here, To change my moods tempestuous with ones of cretonne cheer" etc. oops! Thanks to Charlotte Sherman
@geisha59 @tldevaney You're right!  I missed tumultuous. sorry . The crazy thing is, cretonne is a cheerful upholstery fabric which had it's origins in Normandy France - which neither of them could have known that  was exactly where my dad and so many others would soon be headed. Thanks, Charlotte
@tldevaney 3/3 - thought I could get it all in in 2 tweets..nope. here's the rest:   To let us live and let you stay      When you come home, my love.
@tldevaney 2/3:  To spheres celestial where it is caught       And held by only..you. My world will be tempestuous       With you no longer here, To change my moods tempestuous,      To ones of cretonne cheer. But I‚Äùll plan ahead and often pray      To our peaceful Friend above,
@thoreau_devotee @JohnJHarwood Sure.
