@worldsoccertalk @IrishInAtlanta I have no problem including Fox on the policy criticism, though I can't remember the last time an important general-interest game was behind its 2nd paywall. I certainly can remember recent cases for B/R, NBC, etc. Look, you've got an axe to grind with Fox. I get it.
@worldsoccertalk @IrishInAtlanta What you don't seem to understand is that it's possible for me both to work for Fox as a 2nd job and be critical of one of their business policies. Some would say that takes some guts, but you seem to be fixated on screaming "hypocrisy." ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@worldsoccertalk @IrishInAtlanta No issue with FS1 or FS2, which are part of most single-pay subscriptions. But yes, I include Fox's 2nd paywalls with my criticism (even though it almost never puts top games behind it).
@worldsoccertalk @IrishInAtlanta In terms of media content that isn't live sports video rights‚Äîi.e. shoulder programming, replay rights, even Sports Illustrated magazine, etc‚ÄîI have zero problem with a single paywall or subscription fee. So "hypocrisy" isn't even the right word with anything SI is doing.
@worldsoccertalk @IrishInAtlanta I get why the NFL can charge plenty for Sunday Ticket. But that's a mature sport in the US. Soccer isn't yet, which is why these 2nd paywalls for live rights from anyone (Fox, NBC, B/R, DC United) are hurting themselves in the long run.
@worldsoccertalk @IrishInAtlanta Don't know how to say it any clearer: I have no problem with having to pay a company once (via cable, OTT, satellite sub fees) to watch live games. I have a big problem being asked to pay a company twice for live games (especially when they put the best games behind 2nd paywall).

@easeltyne @WilliamsBob75 My issue is not with paywall content. The reason media is in such a tailspin is because too many consumers think it should be free, which is ridiculous. My issue is with 2nd paywalls for live games on top of the paywall we already pay for them.
@easeltyne @WilliamsBob75 I don't make those decisions, and I'm not speaking for my employers.
@WilliamsBob75 PL would have been better off taking less money and having their title race games the last 2 days be available to a much bigger audience in the US.

@whistleandthumb There already is a paywall (fees from cable and OTT distributors). If they want to have a 2nd paywall and put the best games behind it, they should be very clear about that with leagues when making those bids. I'd argue the extra rights fee money isn't worth it for those leagues.
@ramincol @chriskilroy Last I checked cable and/or cord-cutting service to get NBCSN is not even close to "free." I don't have a problem with paying. I have a problem with paying twice for the same league.
@chriskilroy Never said I wanted it for free. I already have one paywall to watch live PL games. Having a 2nd is excessive and ends up hurting NBC in the long run.
@rsingleton2608 SI isn't the exclusive rights holder to live matches‚Äîand we certainly aren't putting up an additional 2nd paywall for exclusive live matches the way NBC is.

@worldsoccertalk I truly don't care. I don't make those decisions, and I don't like putting live soccer rights (something SI doesn't have) behind a "double jeopardy" paywall for people who are already paying fees.
@Chris78Williams @fuboTV I'm sorry Europeans have to pay more. The sport of soccer is in a completely different stage of its development in the US, and the extra paywalls will hurt the sport's growth‚Äîand in the long term hurt the business itself.
@Chris78Williams You're not addressing that the vast majority of TV watchers in America are already paying up to $200/month for cable TV that they now have to add more to than ever for additional paywalls to watch soccer and other sports.
@Chris78Williams Apples and oranges. Completely different markets and stages of soccer growth.

Never thought I'd see the day when the MLS final (Tata, Gio, Josef, Almir√≥n, Valeri, Blanco, Char√°, Atlanta fans) has more South American flavor and atmosphere than the Libertadores final (in Madrid).
@AlexStone7 @SteveFeekins I don't think the main issues are with FIFA staffers in Switzerland, but rather with leadership that thinks incremental change is transformational when it isn't. Nor did the issues disappear when a new president came in: https://t.co/0yuGXxG3u1
@SteveFeekins @FIFAWWC The FIFA initiatives I've seen in women's soccer are good (and overdue), but the change I'm seeing is incremental, not transformational, which is what needs to happen‚Äîand that comes from the top leadership.
@SteveFeekins Agree that there are some good people at FIFA, including on the women's soccer side. But if you watch the whole video, there are plenty of recent examples from FIFA leadership in the spirit of Solveig.
A male host asking Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg if she knew how to twerk is hardly an isolated case. FIFA and global soccer need transformational leadership to change the culture of the sport.  For all of PFTV Ep 52, go here: https://t.co/sexwiQHiy6 https://t.co/llRELqVQqy

Current lead-in to MLS Cup final broadcast is a Marquette-Wisconsin basketball game.
Biggest win-win-win possible for soccer in US: Copa Libertadores final goes to Miami, kicks off at 5:30 pm ET, FOX buys vacant English US TV rights, uses as dynamite lead-in to MLS Cup final on FOX at 8 pm ET. (Caveats: I work for Fox Sports, no inside info here on my part.)
Fwiw, MLS Cup final is set for December 8 at 8 pm ET.
CONMEBOL announces Copa Libertadores final 2nd leg (River-Boca) will be played outside Argentina on December 8 or 9. Would have to be December 8 if Miami's Hard Rock Stadium were to get the game. (Dolphins play there December 9.)
@sampierron @cmpark Did not realize that until your tweet. Might have to get the guy on my podcast...

@AntoniettaESPN happy birthday!
@youdeadassZ I don't think we're in disagreement. I'm not blaming Ramos, I'm blaming US Soccer.
Flashback to Nov 2017: Tab Ramos refused to be USMNT interim coach, wanted full job, remained in U20 gig. Think of how much good work he could have done with young USMNT over the past 12 months. US went from getting a head start on the world this cycle to getting a late start.
And Julen Lopetegui, who also couldn't manage an interview with US Soccer despite his interest.
US Under-20 MNT beats Mexico 2-0 to win CONCACAF championship. Coach Tab Ramos has also led US to two straight U20 World Cup quarterfinals. But like Martino, Vermes, Marsch &amp; Osorio, Ramos has not been formally interviewed by US Soccer for MNT senior job.

@OpenSourceSoccr @thegoalkeeper I had no need to save face; I was referring to Lopetegui's agent's need.
@MLSist I'm glad @ESPNFC editors are here to tell us that this agent's response "sets the record straight"‚Äîas if he's the arbiter of all the facts here üôÑ
@TheCalcioGuy @lmechegaray @DavidAmoyal Genius, I say!
@EmlynBassnett The point is that US Soccer no doubt would have loved to deny that such an approach took place, because they don't look great to some fans here. But they weren't going to lie by issuing a denial.
@mjcranston No. He passed it to Earnie Stewart, who made that decision.
Note, also, that when I contacted US Soccer about the intermediary's approach for Lopetegui, they could have issued a denial but chose to say no comment.
Understand the desire to not lose face, but I literally spoke to the intermediary who contacted US Soccer on Lopetegui's behalf (a well-connected person who was not his agent). Intermediary contacted USSF's Jay Berhalter, who passed it to Earnie Stewart. https://t.co/JPWlGyq2qE https://t.co/ujOgqphQQW

@frankmSounders @si_soccer I'm fine with a one-game final like the current format.
@frankmSounders @si_soccer MLS may well do single elimination. Various people tell me MLS won't do a group stage because 1) you could have a dead rubber, or 2) they think it's too complicated to understand. Both of which are lame reasons.

13-year veteran star Megan Rapinoe on the rampant USWNT, which earned a berth in World Cup 2019 last night https://t.co/dZkQJ74qVc https://t.co/TgyTmRcxO7
@thegoalkeeper My sense is that‚Äôs a bit different context than the gratuitous comparisons we often see‚Äîand fair game as a result. Most US fans are to some degree fans of WNT &amp; MNT, and if either had missed a WC (men in ‚Äò18, women nearly in ‚Äò11) it would have resonated across all of US soccer.
Last column from Texas: Over the next 9 months, this could become the best USWNT of all time https://t.co/dZkQJ74qVc

3 Thoughts on USWNT 6, Jamaica 0 (US qualifies for World Cup 2019) https://t.co/DXtTGdSvV0
Tobin Heath showing zero interest in taking the penalty that could give her the first international hat trick of her career.
Starting to think anyone in the media covering women's soccer who feels the need to make a comparison to the men's game should get an electric shock every time‚Äîor at least be required to make a women's comparison when they cover the men's game for every time they do it.
Jamaica isn‚Äôt a very good team, but the quality and execution of the US goals so far have been outrageous.
Ridiculous ball from Dahlkemper to Rapinoe on the 2nd US goal vs Jamaica. World Cup berth getting closer. 2-0. https://t.co/55RZd1CpTk
Could be a long night for Jamaica: USWNT scores less than 2 minutes in with a World Cup berth on the line. https://t.co/0mCtMY6Avn
World Cup berth on the line. https://t.co/hYOxrx4i1k
Players-side source tells me relations between USWNT players and US Soccer are better than they have been in some time. No home games on artificial turf in 2018, and federation provided charter flight from NC to Dallas for WCQ decider, which Jill Ellis helped push for.
@AlexStone7 Yeah, Sauerbrunn and Rapinoe are two of the best-informed US players on this topic. So is Christen Press.

Missed this during the World Cup, but love the story of Tim Weah playing in a New York men‚Äôs rec league game this summer on the team of SI‚Äôs @Daniel_Rapaport https://t.co/fI8yxBQzAb
Revenues should matter in prize money, but the men who chime in this way‚Äîand it's always men‚Äîinvariably fail to recognize the difference between for-profit companies (like pro sports teams) and non-profit entities like FIFA whose main purpose is to grow and invest in the sport. https://t.co/1NMoJqljMn
SI: Total prize money for 2019 women's World Cup set to double from $15 million to $30 million. But gap in prize money between women and men's World Cup will have increased over the past 4 years. (Total prize money at men's World Cup 2018: $400 million.) https://t.co/FVmM0DqdEp

Will take a deeper dive into this. Really disappointed so far by the non-USA/Canada/Mexico teams in CONCACAF Women's Championship, which have regressed in the last 4 years. FIFA has to incentivize these national federations to do so much more for the women's game. https://t.co/lR39CjgPuw

@AlexiLalas That was my follow-up question, including whether there was a chance they might move the men's finals to, say, Saturday from Sunday. But that statement was as far as FIFA would go.
A FIFA spokesperson gave me a statement on what they're doing to address the 2019 women's World Cup final being scheduled on the same day as the men's Copa Am√©rica final and men's Gold Cup final. https://t.co/OeKXVrDWeF

@kevvwill I don't know. Think it speaks more to the difficulties of attempted humor/sarcasm to translate in other countries.

"This is a disaster from FIFA."   Allowing the 2019 men's Copa Am√©rica final and men's Gold Cup final to be on the same day as the women's World Cup final shows exactly what FIFA thinks of the women's game. For all of PFTV Ep 43: https://t.co/LgalcLFafE https://t.co/CWv9oLfDXy
@AlexiLalas That's exactly what I'm saying‚Äîfor the same reason that no good coaches ever treat all their players the exact same way (see Wooden, John).
@AlexiLalas Case by case basis. Bradley is at a different stage of his career than those guys‚Äîand has a much bigger role than them if you call him in. Also: Lots more midfield strength for the US right now compared to the forwards. It's always good to bring more nuance to the discussion!
"Unlike our friend @AlexiLalas, I don't think Michael Bradley should be excommunicated from the USMNT due to the World Cup failure. But his play for Toronto this season doesn't merit a call-up right now." See all of PFTV Ep 43 here: https://t.co/LgalcLFafE https://t.co/llZYzoZ3Zn

With LA Galaxy in danger of missing the MLS playoffs, Sigi Schmid resigns as coach. Dom Kinnear will take the job the rest of the 2018 season. One potential replacement for '19: Caleb Porter. But there should be international interest too.

Really enjoyed covering the men‚Äôs World Cup, but it was stunning how FIFA did next to nothing in Russia to promote the 2019 women‚Äôs World Cup to international fans and media. Didn‚Äôt see any visual promotion in Moscow, despite there being plenty of it for Qatar 2022.

Thrilled that Luka Modric gets the Golden Ball as the best player at the World Cup.
Seeing way too many politicians at the World Cup ceremony. Yuck.
Congratulations to France, a deserving winner of World Cup 2018.
4-2. Will everyone remember this France team as a freewheeling attacking machine (when it was for only 2 games)?
Pogba starts the play with a remarkable pass to Mbapp√© and finishes it with a gorgeous strike. Total confidence in his left-footed shot right after total confidence in his right-footed shot. Great technical skill with both feet.
VAR got the penalty call right. Unfortunate that VAR couldn‚Äôt review the dive that led to France‚Äôs first goal.
Croatia has erased a deficit in its fourth straight World Cup knockout-round game. Incredible.
Perisic! Ridiculous first touch and then finish. Another goal off a set piece. Buckle up!
Total dive. And an own goal. Awful.
@AviCreditor @BrianStraus @jonawils @lmechegaray @woodymlb4 @PaulCarrTM @watch_sitv @SInowLIVE @SInow Thanks Avi! Huge thanks to you as well!

My 3 Thoughts on Croatia 2, England 1, sending Croatia to the World Cup final vs France on Sunday https://t.co/hlBVnfuLOi
Mandzukic beat Stones to the ball and scored. Just as Perisic beat Walker to the ball and scored. Anticipation. Fractions of a second.
Great play by Perisic to get to the ball first. Not good enough from Walker or the lack of pressure on the pass. We‚Äôve got a game!
Modric has been so good, but didn‚Äôt need to commit that foul. Overpursued.
Gold from Trippier.
@fiotl She‚Äôs American. Was born in England.
With Belgium‚Äôs loss, the World Cup will continue its streak of every one (men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs, 28 in all) being won with a coach from that country. Is there a deeper reason? Or just a reflection that only countries with entrenched soccer cultures have won World Cups?
World Cup hotel lobbies the week of the semis and final are the greatest Star Wars bar in sports.

Didn't think Sunil Gulati would produce one of the most amusing images of the World Cup, but this qualifies. https://t.co/oVzdBvUMeV
Croatia seems to have a lot of instances when players say they're injured but aren't being believed by their teammates and coaches.
What a strike by Cheryshev. Four goals now. Maybe he has finally earned his coach‚Äôs trust to start every game?
@mpscheerer thanks!
England's first World Cup semifinal since 2015
Thoroughly impressive, prepared, well-executing, likeable üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø team, now coming to the World Cup semifinals.
Curious to see what Sweden looks like when they‚Äôre desperate.
Playing Sweden is a total grind, but really impressed by how England has found open headers on both goals.

@DasGherkin Sarah, I think you're taking the term "hipster" to be far more denigrating than I do. Which is to say, it's not a denigrating term to me.
Premier League hipsters love to slam Roberto Mart√≠nez, and when his team succeeds they say it's because of Belgium's talent. But Mart√≠nez got it right tonight, and there's a reason he has always been a good knockout tournament coach.

My 3 Thoughts on Belgium 2, Brazil 1 and France 2, Uruguay 0 at the World Cup https://t.co/wBNUJfdaBb
Brazil is out. Belgium's front three‚ÄîDe Bruyne, Lukaku and Hazard‚Äîwere absolutely incredible. What a game.
Renato Augusto comes on the field and almost instantly makes an impact with the goal. Really tough header to execute, and he did it. 2-1.
@ene9807 interesting!
How do you not give Neymar a yellow there? Would be suspended for the next game (if he has one).
@adowniebrazil Multiple problems, including up top.
Firmino Time is now.
What a goal by De Bruyne. And once again amazing work by Lukaku. 2-0. Brazil on the ropes!!!
Own goal. Again. This game has a high Craziness Potential.
@blazindw Thanks!
Lloris save may be the save of the World Cup. But I still haven‚Äôt seen a better angle on Pickford‚Äôs save on Uribe. Was it going in the goal? If yes, that‚Äôs my choice so far.

@the_mls He‚Äôs 23
Haven‚Äôt seen a player crying in-game like Gim√©nez did since Adam Morrison and Thiago Silva.
Had concerns that France might be too soft. Those have been answered in this game.
Mbapp√© channeling his inner Neymar.
I know it took a wicked swerve. But man, that can‚Äôt happen.
Terrific finish by Varane on the free kick. France showing it can score in different ways. Mistake by Bentancur led to the chance.
Per Opta on those set piece statistics
@DaleJohnsonESPN Opta says 5 for Uruguay and 4 for England. I can tell you off the top of my head that Uruguay has more than 1 with Gim√©nez vs Egypt and the Su√°rez free kick vs Russia.
Uruguay has scored more goals on set pieces than any other team in this World Cup (including England) while also being one of the best set-piece defending teams in the tournament. For Uruguay to win, look for Su√°rez on direct free kicks and God√≠n/Gim√©nez at both ends of the field
No Cavani in the Uruguay lineup. Not a surprise, and Stuani could still cause problems, but it‚Äôs a bummer when such special games don‚Äôt have a Cavani or James Rodr√≠guez.
Anyone else ready for your World Cup withdrawal to be over today? https://t.co/oxyCi2W4qH

@smithsam1993 Thanks!
Maybe, just once, a keeper should just stand straight up and not dive in either direction?
Diego Maradona is livestreaming this game on Instagram stories with his Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary.
Yerry Mina is money on corners. What a World Cup.
The polar extremes on the responses to whether FIFA will reward Geiger on his officiating performance are fascinating. My sense is, knowing FIFA, it might (even though I think he lost control of the game at one point). https://t.co/kwuz9CrLf9
@DanielGAlarcon I honestly don‚Äôt know the answer, but knowing FIFA, I think there‚Äôs a chance the answer is yes.
Genuine question: Does FIFA reward Geiger for this refereeing performance?
Sweden gets rewarded for all that pressure with Forsberg‚Äôs goal. Thought we might get a smile from Sweden‚Äôs coach, but...
Lukaku's run on Belgium's stoppage-time winner is crazy. Drags one way to create space for the pass to Meunier. Drags the other way to create space for Chadli. Then does a mind-bending dummy at speed when he would surely love to score himself after missing so many chances earlier

My 3 Thoughts on Day 19 at World Cup 2018 https://t.co/GQGiPTwKG6
Electric finish to an amazing half. All-time dummy by Lukaku. 3-2 Belgium.
How many times tonight where you think: Lukaku has to finish that?
Love seeing Belgium challenged and responding to real pressure. Hazard terrific there. Lots of time left.
Wild game. Mistake by the Japanese keeper allowed Vertonghen‚Äôs goal, such as it was, to happen.
Japan giving us some of the best soccer/football we‚Äôve seen in the World Cup. Exhilarating stuff.
This tournament, man. Fantastic stuff from Japan and Inui.
Great transition from Japan. Thought Haraguchi waited too long, but that finish was pinpoint. Poor from Vertonghen.
Vincent Kompany is back in the starting lineup for Belgium vs Japan. One of the most insightful players I have ever interviewed and a star of my new book. You can order it here: https://t.co/v8jMIUGQ6S https://t.co/r92qSlt7dG
@komandnaya True!
Confused as to why anyone would have an issue with Osorio saying it‚Äôs better for more Mexican players (or US players for that matter) to try to play in European clubs.
USA fans: Would you like to have Juan Carlos Osorio as the next USMNT coach?
@rjohnston4 Yes. Feels different somehow with these 3.
@CoachGallimore Yes
PSG forwards (Mbapp√©, Neymar, Cavani) having a great World Cup. Possible to have all 3 and still get the most that‚Äôs possible out of them?
Mexico‚Äôs biggest mistake was not winning the group when they had a great chance to do it.
@moyadodd Thanks Moya!
Great work by Willian with the burst and pass, and Neymar finishes for 1-0. Brazilian pressure so intense to start the second half.

My 3 Thoughts on Russia over Spain and Croatia over Denmark at the World Cup https://t.co/FQjo13Gxx1
On why that's not a red card: Triple jeopardy rule was changed. If player makes an attempt on the ball, it's a yellow in that situation.
Nice save, but Schmeichel was a yard off his line when the ball was struck.
@nickmarkel @honigstein Certainly not all!
@davidqatar @7amkickoff @bglendenning @realDonaldTrump Case by case within every country. We‚Äôre not in disagreement here.
Terrific penalties by Russia and Akinfeev. Never any urgency from Spain. Some blame has to fall on Hierro. Didn‚Äôt recognize the need to make more dramatic changes in-game.
Russia eliminates Spain on penalties. Pre-2008 Spain is back!
Time to send Piqu√© up top.
Thiago for Koke. Or Aspas for Koke. Now.
In terms of developing and executing an effective gameplan, Russia and Cherchesov deserve a lot of credit here.
Even if Spain wins this game, there‚Äôs something missing with this Spain team. Not as tight defensively, not as much cutting edge in the attack.
@tsnmike Thanks Mike!
We‚Äôve got a game. 1-1. Too many uncharacteristic errors by Piqu√© in this World Cup.
If he hadn‚Äôt put it in his own goal, Ignashevich should have been called for a penalty on that play.
Spain‚Äôs goals in this World Cup have mostly been very un-Spain-like.
@7amkickoff @bglendenning @realDonaldTrump I was responding to the continued nonsense statements that US soccer journalists know nothing. Every country has higher and lower levels of discourse, and it's case by case. I was sharing my broad opinion on what I've seen at WC press events over the years. Feel free to disagree.
@UruFootballEN With all due respect, I fully understand that FIFA recognizes those titles as world championships. I just disagree with the decision. Please see my other tweets about Uruguay. Full respect for the country and the team.
@RaeComm @alywagner @FOXSports @FOXSoccer Great to see you guys in Russia!!
@hrustar I'll find out!

@michaelm_1978 Thanks!
@bglendenning @de_Koonk Not my questions, Barry. Seems like you don‚Äôt want to find common ground, so I‚Äôll stop trying.
@EwanMacKenna @bglendenning @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs a response to nonsense I‚Äôm hearing about US journalists. I‚Äôve been to enough World Cups to know the questions that I hear in press conferences. I‚Äôve enjoyed a lot of your stuff, but not the columns that criticize women‚Äôs sports.
@EwanMacKenna @bglendenning @realDonaldTrump Think you‚Äôre revealing much more about yourself here than anything else. And I‚Äôve read far more of your work than you probably realize.
@bglendenning It was a response based on 7 World Cups of observing press conference questions.
@bglendenning @realDonaldTrump Dude, let me buy you a drink sometime. To be compared to Trump is the absolute worst. I‚Äôm just tired of US journalists being ripped when we, for the most part, bring a pretty high standard to the coverage here.
@chrisoaks2007 I‚Äôve been to 7 men‚Äôs World Cups and press conferences throughout. Maybe it‚Äôs a truth that some don‚Äôt want to hear.
@bglendenning @realDonaldTrump Hi Barry, you‚Äôre a terrific writer, and there are many in England. But I‚Äôm tired of nationalistic Trump comparisons and you only engaging with me over something negative that you want to say.
@daniellevslaton Thanks for listening and nice job tonight! I always wondered what would happen if Brazil women won the World Cup. Doubt the men would add a 6th star!
@BigEasyMLS @si_soccer @BrianStraus thanks!

@MoyMu23 Jaja, keepers in the box forever!
@JuanG_Arango I knew the history of Uruguay‚Äôs stars and questioned the stars on the US badge when they were there. You‚Äôre not entitled to your own facts, Juan.
@ata_dizdar I know this and still disagree with it. Why is that hard to understand?
@JustRichWebster You act as if I don't know why that is the case. I do know, and I disagree with it.
@JuanG_Arango The idea that anyone's opinion only has value that is dependent on the success of their country's national team is ludicrous.
This Uruguay team is good enough to win the World Cup.
Why do they always put it on the keeper's head when he runs up to the box for a corner at the end of the game?
The Seattle-Portland game at 4:30 pm ET on FOX will also have a live interview at halftime with new DC United signing Wayne Rooney.
Much better 2nd half from Portugal rewarded with an equalizer.
@csettimi Sigh. And three weeks later...
Always found this fascinating about Su√°rez and Cavani (from my 2014 SI story) https://t.co/Nrh5vxEaV5 https://t.co/wilVXPq6vL
Respect history, love Uruguay and still don‚Äôt think they should confuse people into thinking they‚Äôve won 4 World Cups when they haven‚Äôt. https://t.co/RUN8SZn4Ik
So great from Cavani to Su√°rez to Cavani. Does that count as a give-and-go? üòÄ
It's basically the same as the University of Kansas putting up banners for its Helms Foundation national basketball titles as if they were the same as NCAA titles.
We haven't talked enough about how lame it is that Uruguay's 4 stars above its badge include 2 for Olympic titles. Come on, guys.
Loved Sampaoli's work with Universidad de Chile, the Chilean national team and Sevilla. What the hell happened once he took over Argentina?
@JaimeACardenas Yes!
This column, by Jorge Valdano, remains the best explanation of Argentina's World Cup problems. He's the former GM of Real Madrid. Why can't he have a similar position with the Argentine federation? https://t.co/NmOVYKEjPl
Symbol of Argentina's World Cup: Desperately needing a goal to survive in the final minute, and Otamendi decides to go mental on an opponent and waste time.
To avoid Messi retiring internationally, Argentina needs to get someone competent running the federation who makes a smart hire on the coach and runs things smoothly day-to-day, both when the team is together and when it is not.
Hope you're enjoying all the goals in this game, because Uruguay-Portugal might give us 120 minutes of zeroes. (I hope this isn't the case!)
Mbappe again. 4-2. We're finally seeing the real France, and it is majestic on the attacking side. Highest ceiling of any team here when it's functioning at its best.
Would pay good money for a Sergio Romero Cam during this World Cup.
This game might end 7-4.
@RattoNBCS Got me. Maybe the Twitter crowd knows?
Not bad for Pavard's first international goal. 2-2. What a game. Classic on our hands!
Argentina leads, and it's totally against the run of play, but that doesn't matter. Wow. 2-1.
What a strike by Di Mar√≠a with no French defender pressuring him. Did he just do a Sam Cassell big-cojones move on the celebration?
That first touch again from Mbapp√©‚ÄîTHE SECOND-YOUNGEST PLAYER IN THE TOURNAMENT‚Äîwho's eating Argentina's back line for lunch.
That first touch and burst of speed from Mbapp√© is something else. 1-0.
Would love to, but I literally have to record my convo with Brian in the 15-minute window between the end of the day's games, my nightly SI video and the start of Fox's World Cup Tonight show on the set in Red Square. https://t.co/QV0lCCEU3V

At this rate, Belgium and England might just agree to even up the fair-play points and let a coin flip decide.

@senyorreporter He advanced to the knockout rounds with 6 points. So yeah.
Good World Cup day for MLS players: Waston (goal), Svensson, Vela.
Love those runs by Paulinho out of the midfield, and Coutinho's pass was perfect. 1-0 Brazil.
Switzerland scores against Costa Rica and moves (as of right now) to the top of the group ahead of Brazil. (Group winner will face Mexico.)
@TheWilderThings Haha, thought I might come back to no desk at all...
@TheWilderThings Wait, do I no longer have a desk next to yours?
Sweden and Mexico survive. World Cup champion Germany becomes the 4th of the last 5 defending champions to fail to advance from the group. Mexico owes South Korea a nice thank you gift.
Mexican fans going nuts, and their team is getting slammed 3-0.
SOUTH KOREA GOAL!!! (After VAR review.)
How did Hummels miss that?!?
Eerie similarities to WC02, when Guus Hiddink‚Äôs South Korea did a huge favor in this same spot to help USA survive.
South Korean goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-Woo is one of my favorite players of the World Cup.
Every Mexican a South Korea fan now.
Own goal. Sweden 3:0 Mexico. And attention shifts to Germany-Korea. Mexico still in as of right now, but a Germany goal would make it Germany in, Mexico out.
That late Korean goal vs Mexico looms large now.
Sweden 2:0 Mexico now. Mexico still in as of right now, but if Germany scores it will overtake Mexico.
3 of the last 4 World Cup Champions have gone out in the group stage of the following World Cup. Germany about to make it 4 of the last 5?
Sweden scores. And as of right now, it‚Äôs Mexico and Sweden in, Germany out.

My 5 Thoughts on Day 13 of World Cup 2018: https://t.co/lFYKIaH5LP
Croatia goal! A bit of insurance for #ARG.
Marcos Rojo? Marcos Rojo!!!
Higua√≠n and missed chances in big games for ARG...
Iceland equalizes. Hope you've got 2 screens right now!
Of all the wrestling moves we‚Äôve seen in this tournament, they decided to call THAT one by Mascherano a penalty?
Nigeria scores. Croatia scores. More to come, surely.
Argentina's biggest problems have been in the midfield, not elsewhere. Much better so far tonight.
Messi! With his right foot! What a ball from Banega.
In: Higua√≠n, Di Mar√≠a, Banega, Armani. Out: Ag√ºero, Caballero, Meza, Acu√±a. https://t.co/TbQ163DAg3
Can we all agree that France-Denmark game never happened?
@ThatDamnYank True, and that isn‚Äôt happening. Maybe make it two separate draws to limit it to teams with similar rest periods?
Agree with this. https://t.co/BsBAz0i6Pr
France-Denmark: First 0-0 of the World Cup?
Finally, finally, Peru gets its goal.
@JeffAgoos Results are part of it, but also close to complete performances.
Best teams I've seen so far at World Cup (based purely on performance in Russia): 1. Croatia 2. Mexico 3. Belgium 4. England Wondering when any of the pre-tournament favorites might join this group?
@FernandoFiore I'm going to win either way, my friend. That wig is impressive!
Every team is still alive in Group D ahead of today's simultaneous kickoffs (2 pm ET, FOX and FS1), including Iceland. How did #ISL get so good? Watch SI TV's half-hour documentary with astonishing scenery (7-day free trial): https://t.co/ny7NBZpoE7 https://t.co/LpPPF2Mhhz

My 5 Thoughts on Day 12 of World Cup 2018 https://t.co/L1BeV6ZaBo
Historic double-VAR moment here!
Morocco is definitely in the territory of best World Cup teams ever to be eliminated after 2 games.
Ricardo Quaresma with a classic Quaresma goal.
Spain goal‚ÄîIsco. Order restored (for now).
Morocco scores against Spain! Awful turnover, and Morocco finally scores its first goal. Strap yourself in.
What is Piqu√© doing coming in 2-footed like that? Couple of wildly uncharacteristic plays by him in this World Cup.
@chagollan6 hope you enjoy!
@blueforlifekc @BrianStraus thanks!
@nicolleferguson Thanks Nicolle! Hope you‚Äôre doing great.
‚ÄúDifferent countries have different measures of success for the World Cup.‚Äù And for Panama, a 6-1 loss at the hands of England still carried plenty of meaning. On the impact of Panama's 1st World Cup goal in its history: https://t.co/PI9PFt4gaD

My 5 Thoughts on Day 11 of World Cup 2018 https://t.co/wgxub7emsp
Thought Falcao was done as a player a couple years ago. So cool to see him scoring World Cup goals. Great ball by Quintero.
Warming up for our next World Cup Tonight show with @FernandoFiore @MoyMu23 @rachelbonnetta @RudenkoOfficial #GuusHiddink https://t.co/EhaDTJ0Hf8
Moussa Wagu√©, the 19-year-old who scored Senegal's second goal, went through Qatar's Aspire Academy and now plays for the Qatari-owned club Eupen in Belgium. You can read about the program he came through in @sebabbot's terrific book "The Away Game" https://t.co/Avzr6ngLW1
Senegal takes the lead! What a game. Chances at both ends. Gorgeous sequence of feints and turns and flicks in the box before the finish. 2-1.
Panama getting plenty of joy from the nation's first World Cup goal https://t.co/YL7KYpS5s0
If Brazil finishes 1st in its group and Germany takes 2nd in its group, England would probably be better off finishing 2nd than 1st in its group for the knockout-round matchups.
Group H games have been balanced and fascinating, and Senegal-Japan is no different.
If you‚Äôre wondering how Panama beat USA in World Cup qualifying, it came down largely to the points the teams won against Costa Rica. Though if USA had gotten a point more against any opponent, it would have qualified. Bottom line: USA didn‚Äôt deserve it over a 10-game tournament. https://t.co/SbOeW7b0g6
That‚Äôs a penalty, indeed. CONCACAF referee wouldn‚Äôt have called it.
"Everything's going to be OK. Senegal plays today!" https://t.co/SpcDA3dSYo
@bnceo Thanks!
@jpereznavarro @FernandoFiore @MoyMu23 Thanks Jorge! Love your calls with @marianot19!
There's something about playing for Germany in a World Cup or Real Madrid in Champions League‚Äîthe advantage of history and a winning culture‚Äîthat comes out in the moments that matter most. Like tonight with Toni Kroos, who plays for both those teams. https://t.co/fiP5L5uoB1

My 5 Thoughts on Day 10 of World Cup 2018 https://t.co/9F6V7WZsf1
Scenes. 10-man Germany scores late in stoppage time to beat Sweden. German, man. What a strike by Kroos.
What a counter and goal by Sweden. World champion Germany on the ropes!
Incredible how often Germany has left itself exposed in the back against Mexico‚Äîand now Sweden. Penalty for me.
Mexico wins again. 2 games, 6 points. Osorio 2 for 2 on gameplans. Players 2 for 2 on execution.
There‚Äôs a line between physical and dirty, and South Korea has been awfully close to that line today.
Totally different game for Mexico than Germany was, but El Tri is handling the greater possession well. Mass-quantity fouling by the Koreans, who remain dangerous on the break.
@paaatcha Yes!
IT‚ÄôS SOCCER TIME üî•

Would be lying if I said I‚Äôm not concerned about Belgium‚Äôs defending against better teams. But maybe they can just outscore everyone.
No player in the last 3 men‚Äôs World Cups has scored more than 6 goals in a single tournament (James, 2014). Lukaku and Cristiano are already on 4 (and counting).
Commentator‚Äôs curse
Realize Belgium is starting with Panama and Tunisia, but man, this seems like a different Belgium team than the one at Euro 2016.
Neymar. Chicharito. Even players who WIN World Cup games are crying. Champions League may have overtaken World Cup as the soccer litmus test, but World Cup still has something Champions League doesn't: Limitless pressure &amp; emotion, even in the group stage. https://t.co/PeNpsbPL1D

Just got sent this by @garzball. Helps explain the Albanian eagle goal celebrations by Xhaka and Shaqiri against Serbia. https://t.co/rSTI3Hqqey
Fantastic comeback by Switzerland. What does the "wings" goal celebration mean?
Heard in my room: "Wish Xhaka would show something like that for Arsenal."
Xhaka! What a strike. 1-1.
Great defensive work by the Serbs to win the ball deep and set up the Mitrovic goal.
Besides Musa and Moses, this might be Nigeria‚Äôs MVP today https://t.co/YOIYKGzszS
It‚Äôs going to be a wild group finale of simultaneous games with Nigeria-Argentina and Iceland-Croatia. Argentina isn‚Äôt out yet‚Äîbut at this point it has been the worst team in the group.  Croatia 6 Nigeria 3 Iceland 1 (-2 GD) Argentina 1 (-3 GD)
NIGERIA IS HERE
Terrific goal by Musa on the break. What a first touch from the Moses pass.
@Deepakr05 @AztecaAmeliaaa @BrianStraus @FutMexNation @MexSoccerShow Thanks!

Even the winners in this tournament are crying. Neymar. Chicharito. So much emotion and pressure. The World Cup is the best.
Realize Brazil‚Äôs resurgence the last couple years has come largely through great balance, but can‚Äôt help but wonder if Firmino and Gabriel Jesus should be together up top from the start.
@GeoffShreeves Fair. It was used worst in FA Cup. But MLS has been bad with it recently too.
Cojones from Coutinho in stoppage time. Great team plays by Firmino and Jesus to set it up.
@GeoffShreeves Overall, VAR has been terrific so far. Will never be 100% correct on everything, but it has been very much a net positive to this point.
@milenagimon S√≠, estoy de acuerdo
The success of VAR at the World Cup (so far) makes the English mismanagement of VAR during the FA Cup look even worse.
VAR gets it right. Again.
Watch Mexico win its group and still get Brazil in the Round of 16.
@DanielGAlarcon üòÄ
Tite gets it right, adds another forward (Firmino) and keeps Jesus out there.  Sampaoli got it wrong, taking Ag√ºero off for Higua√≠n instead of letting them play together up top.
Keylor is so, so good. Gives his team a chance no matter the opponent.
HT #BRA 0-0 #CRC. (Whispers: Best scoring chance so far was Costa Rica‚Äôs.) So far, the polar opposite of the memorably wide-open 5-2 Brazil victory over Costa Rica at World Cup 2002.
Chucky may be the James 2014 of this World Cup. https://t.co/OlmBk96R6B

My 6 Thoughts on Day 8 of World Cup 2018 https://t.co/hciNf0gaCr
Goal difference of minus-3 could be a killer for Argentina even if it wins its group finale.
What a goal by Modric. Operatic scenes in Nizhny Novgorod. Croatia 2, Argentina 0.
Sometimes your goalkeeper gets hurt and you get a Goycochea. Sometimes you get a Caballero.

Bummed out for Peru. Such an emotional story to get here. So many joyous fans on the streets of Russia. Can only wonder how things might have been different if Cueva had converted the penalty vs Denmark.

@JohnPMotta I asked. We‚Äôll see on an answer.
New guest at our hotel is Sepp Blatter, who‚Äôs in Russia at the invitation of Vladimir Putin.
Saudi Arabia was starting to look competent. And then that from the keeper. 1-0 Uruguay.
@aloaizaoficial @FIFAcom Thanks! Blatter is actually staying at my hotel here!
Morocco the better team in 2 games = 0 points.   Portugal outplayed in 2 games = 4 points.  Cristiano Ronaldo far and away the figure of the World Cup so far.
@bitNomad Fox has no control over the HBS cameras, just as is the case with every other rights holder.
Whether it‚Äôs Ronaldo or Pepe, love how often Portugal gives us visual evidence that players have a direct influence on Fernando Santos‚Äôs substitutions.
@AndrewDasNYT Yes! Trails by 1. Own Goal fist-pumping furiously after Pogba‚Äôs goal was switched to OG.

Tony Meola called Senegal-Poland yesterday, did the World Cup Tonight show until 3 am last night and is now calling the first game today (Portugal-Morocco). Impressive from the former US keeper.
Ronaldo. Again. Amazing. Now the No. 2 scorer all time in men's international soccer.
@VictorZapat1 Look at the Messi GOAT photos, which are also part of an Adidas campaign at WC. Look at how Ronaldo celebrated his goal the other night. Look at the goatee today. This is classic Ronaldo.
@VictorZapat1 100% it is
@VictorZapat1 Yes, I do! Which is what makes this even more fascinating.
Ronaldo growing a goatee and celebrating goals by grabbing imaginary goat whiskers‚Äîin response to Messi‚Äôs G.O.A.T. portrait with a real live goat‚Äîis my favorite petty World Cup subplot üêê https://t.co/8ef6cepP94

Russia having the injury-prone Dzagoev go off injured in the first game was a godsend. His replacement, Cheryshev, has been fantastic.
"Russia plus-8 goal difference" was not something I expected to write during this World Cup.
Own Goal (5) well on his way to the Golden Boot.

Another set-piece goal. Advantage: Japan. So many momentum shifts in this game. More to come?
@YesThatBrooke @jpereznavarro @marianot19 I‚Äôm not hiding any of that. But I can also have opinions.
Haven‚Äôt always loved P√©kerman‚Äôs in-game substitutions, but today‚Äôs have been inspired.
Love @jpereznavarro and @marianot19 on the call for this game. Over the years, there hasn‚Äôt been nearly enough Latino style included in English-language US soccer broadcasts.
So much to talk about in this game. It‚Äôs had everything so far.
Kind of glad Edwin Cardona isn‚Äôt here for this Japan game.
Couldn‚Äôt imagine a better start for Japan‚Äîor a worse one for Colombia, which will now play from minute 5 with 10 men.
It‚Äôs all happening! Colombia red card and penalty.
Convenient that Izquierdo plays on Colombia‚Äôs left wing.

My 5 Thoughts on Day 5 of World Cup 2018: England! Belgium! VAR! https://t.co/ZHBtgUXjJp
12 European teams have played in the World Cup. The only one to lose so far is Germany.
Insane trivela assist by De Bruyne.
RIP Walter Bahr. He had the assist on the goal scored by Joe Gaetjens that beat England 1-0 in World Cup 1950. Always enjoyed speaking to Walter, including for this story in 2014 https://t.co/v643pyehgU
RIP Walter Bahr. The last surviving member of the 1950 USA World Cup team that famously beat England 1-0. His sons, Chris and Matt, both won Super Bowls as placekickers. A kind man. Thoughts are with his family.
Mertens picks it right out of the air. Golazo.
Credit to Panama so far. In their first World Cup game ever, they aren't uncomfortable on the big stage. Belgium strangely subdued for much of that half. HT 0-0.
@ChrisChavez @matt_dollinger Ha! You haven‚Äôt seen me actually run yet.
I know team chemistry issues are important, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Leroy San√© would make their teams better, period.
@kyal45 Every goal is reviewed
@ravi_hiranand Long way to go though!
To my surprise, VAR still getting it right at the World Cup (so far). Sweden 1, South Korea 0.

My 5 Thoughts on Day 4 of World Cup 2018 (Mexico!) https://t.co/lvbRRTUf9o
How many times have we seen Coutinho do that before from distance? Uncanny.
Came into this World Cup thinking Osorio had a decent shot to be the next USMNT coach. At this rate (and things could change), he may get offers much bigger than that.
Mexican fans are going to take over central Moscow tonight. Going to be epic.

What a set of passes by Mexico, what a composed finish by Chucky Lozano. Mexico up 1-0 on Germany! Terrific counter.
Another World Cup game decided by a set-piece. Kolarov's fantastic free kick makes the difference for Serbia vs Costa Rica. Unfortunate foul to set it up by Portland's Guzm√°n.
Costa Rica remains, as ever, really hard to play against. Respect.
@rickymachel @JohnStrong Nope. Even without that context, the point holds. It was a tie that felt like a win for Iceland.
The global desire to think Americans know nothing about soccer/football is the biggest punchline of all. This clip cuts off @JohnStrong‚Äôs reference to a famous newspaper headline. It‚Äôs actually a brilliant call. https://t.co/DO41SdfA9d

My 5 Thoughts on Day 3 of World Cup 2018 https://t.co/EzlIsLCfwM
That‚Äôs an own goal.
Big result for Iceland today vs Argentina. Want to learn how #ISL got so good? Watch the half-hour doc "Exploring Planet F√∫tbol: Iceland" (producer: @leefeiner) on our free 7-day trial: https://t.co/oQ1FUIqmND https://t.co/LpPPF2Mhhz
Impressed that Denmark found a way to win in the second half. Missed opportunity for Peru. For the second time today, a failed penalty kick looms large.
Kind of fun sitting next to Guus Hiddink telling stories about having Peru‚Äôs Jefferson Farf√°n and DaMarcus Beasley at PSV, where he took them to the Champions League semifinals.
@alinearnotm Thanks!
Mission accomplished today for Iceland. This is the way they always play.
Man, Iceland knows how to rebound quickly from an early deficit in big games. Same thing happened vs England in the Euro. Instant response.
What a turn by Ag√ºero. Can‚Äôt defend that.
Pogba quiet all game but then big in the moment. Still, lots of questions for France to answer.
Not a great two days for Barcelona centerbacks Piqu√© and Umtiti. France 1:1 Australia.
What‚Äôs Umtiti doing there?
VAR is here. Penalty to France.
Great to meet up with Venezuelan rising star and Florida State forward Deyna Castellanos @deynac18, who‚Äôs in Russia promoting women‚Äôs soccer with FIFA on the #DareToShine hashtag during World Cup. Podcast interview out tonight! https://t.co/YVgPlsaIjo

And, after all that, Russia and Iran lead the World Cup groups.
My 5 Thoughts on a memorable night from Cristiano and everything else from Day 2 of World Cup 2018 https://t.co/kbNlC1agmh
Standing O for Cristiano.
Quite remarkably, Sergio Ramos is only the No. 3 villain in this game.
@rachelbonnetta (quietly slides down in my chair)
Good god. What a strike by Nacho. Better with every replay. Makes up for the early penalty.
Spain is playing like classic Spain tonight‚Äîexcept when they're scoring their goals.
David De Gea, meet Loris Karius.
This World Cup needed this game. What a jolt of adrenalin. Awesome stuff.
What a finish by Diego Costa. VAR shout denied. Yes, he made contact with Pepe. Yes, Pepe embellished it.
3 minutes, one Cristiano Ronaldo goal from the spot. Carvajal's replacement Nacho didn't suspect Cristiano would try a stepover, apparently.
Very much looking forward to the Diego Costa-Pepe matchup.
An own goal with authority. Unbelievable.
ANOTHER late set-piece goal, and Iran is ahead. Wow.
Tight game between Iran and Morocco, who each need 3 points with Portugal and Spain in the group. @alywagner killing it on the call with @RaeComm.
@AnAbnos Good luck!
Iceland-Argentina is at 9 am ET tomorrow on FOX. We went to Iceland with https://t.co/FaPitGl62P to find out how Iceland got so good. Do the 7-day free trial for the full half-hour doc, which is worth it (producer @leefeiner): https://t.co/oQ1FUIqmND https://t.co/LpPPF2Mhhz
German rising star Joshua Kimmich may be the World Cup‚Äôs best right back. I sat down with him to discuss his remarkable rise‚Äîand his thoughts on the matchup with Chucky Lozano https://t.co/6GNrZtdZbs
Surprise: Uruguay set-piece magic = Atl√©tico Madrid set-piece magic. Gim√©nez and God√≠n bringing that Atleti steel today.
‚ÄúMy name is Jos√© Gim√©nez.‚Äù Uruguay up late.
Diego God√≠n not a big fan of his teammates in this game. Rough one for Su√°rez‚Äîand others. But give Egypt credit. Hegazy and general organization have been terrific.
Whenever I see Wanda on the signboards, I can‚Äôt help but think of Wakanda and wish they had a team in the World Cup.
Insane missed sitter by Su√°rez. My goodness.
In my book, Vincent Kompany said Luis Su√°rez is the best in the world among forwards who can lurk and then pick the ball off a defender‚Äôs foot in a dangerous area.
Mohamed Salah not starting for Egypt vs Uruguay. The surprise to me was C√∫per saying Salah would play at all. He only recently started training again, and the games vs #RUS and #KSA are likely to be the decisive ones for #EGY.
New World Cup Daily podcast: @BrianStraus and I talk #RUS 5, #KSA 0 and getting negged by Ars√®ne Wenger in an elevator. Plus I interview German great @LMatthaeus10, who gives me his ideal Germany starting 11 https://t.co/o5U5DrF5eN
World Cup Day 1 from Red Square: My take on Russia 5, Saudi Arabia 0, a packed Day 2 headlined by Spain-Portugal, Mohamed Salah and Luis Su√°rez; and Gerard Piqu√©'s fantastic Michigan 1989 tweet https://t.co/jlw8YwQvWf
Why would Antoine Griezmann want to do his own version of The Decision? What about that event was viewed as worth repeating?
4-0. Goal difference could be huge for Russia.
Maybe, but the top of Asia and CONCACAF are somewhat similar. https://t.co/S6wTmnM77R
Currently imagining the quality of some of the teams that will qualify for a 48-team World Cup.
Seeing Saudi Arabia, one wonders how USA missed this World Cup.
The sub, Cheryshev, makes it 2-0 for Russia. Composed finish. Saudi Arabian defensive organization is dreadful.
Great ball from Golovin, and Russia leads 1-0.
@thomascope_cope He speaks great English
Fun interview today with German rising star Joshua Kimmich, who may be the best right back at the World Cup. Talked about several topics, including his Sunday matchup with Mexico‚Äôs Chucky Lozano. Story out soon! https://t.co/3yKeipYpI9

Came full circle today. Decided to stick with my pick of Spain to win the World Cup. It's the same players. Viva Gerard Piqu√© y Steve Fisher!
Midnight in Moscow. Now realizing that our Red Square hotel will have crazy fan noise outside until 4 am every night for a month. Contemplating wearing noise-canceling headphones while I (try to) sleep. Might even take vuvuzelas over this.

World Cup '26 vote wasn't close: 134 to 65 votes.
The USA-led bid to host World Cup '26 (with Mexico and Canada) has beaten Morocco. USA will host 60 of the 80 games in World Cup '26, including every game from the quarterfinals onward. Historic moment for soccer in North America.

The firing of Spain coach Julen Lopetegui 2 days before the World Cup‚Äîa day after he was named Real Madrid coach‚Äîis yet another example of how much bigger the club game has gotten than the international game.
Real Madrid's Florentino P√©rez probably cackling now. He'll get Lopetegui even sooner than he expected.
Hoping Lopetegui lasts more than 6 months with Real Madrid.
17-year-old Canadian Alphonso Davies speaks onstage for the United Bid to host World Cup '26. Terrific prospect. Here's why he was named the current MLS Player of the Week: https://t.co/eeg8Q5buog
Spain is back to being pre-2008 Spain.
Wow, Spain has fired coach Julen Lopetegui 2 days before the World Cup. He was announced as the new Real Madrid manager yesterday, angering his Spanish federation bosses. Insanity. Spain had been my pick to win the World Cup. Not now.
FIFA Congress is 55 minutes behind schedule now. Expecting vote for WC26 around 6:30 am NYC time.
Swedish FA president takes the stage and appeals for more prize money from FIFA for women's World Cup.
@johannagara Just heard that
Looks like we may know the host of World Cup '26 at almost the exact time we find out if Spain's Julen Lopetegui will stay on as national team coach in the wake of yesterday's announcement he's joining Real Madrid.
@FernandoFiore You can trust me!
Vote for World Cup '26 host is scheduled for 5:35 am NYC time, but FIFA Congress program is currently 16 minutes behind schedule. Intriguing note: 17-year-old Canadian prospect Alphonso Davies (current MLS Player of the Week) is set to speak in the United Bid address.
@DavidAmoyal Congrats!

@gabaldonart @si_soccer thanks!
Cordeiro: United WC26 bid has spent around $8 million on bid, meeting its budget. USA will pay proportional cost based on how many games it would host.
Cordeiro: We don‚Äôt know for sure if USA, Canada and Mexico would all get automatic bids for hosting WC26, but we believe that will be the case based on what has happened in the past. 6.5 bids for CONCACAF.
In Moscow ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs WC26 vote, US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro says North American bid has met with 150 national federation presidents from around the world.
@parkrun_anita 1-1 final‚Äînot bad for USA!
@RaeComm @EASPORTSFIFA @santiagoj83 Congrats Derek!

@RobGehringNFL @fuboTV Hi Rob, producer is @leefeiner camera is Nick Midwig
@Okwonga @fuboTV Thanks Musa! Just saw the finished 33-minute final cut. Really happy with it.
@el_gaucho8 It‚Äôs just not the whole staff for the World Cup, which is a diverse group as a whole.
@andrewjskerritt Understand, but this is not the entire group
@TheKaylaKnapp You‚Äôre awesome, friend.
Great to spend time with some of our Fox Sports World Cup group in NYC https://t.co/d6yhtrt38r
Just a reminder that FIFA‚Äôs technical bid reports for the vote involving USA and Qatar for World Cup ‚Äò22 were basically ignored by the voters.
@LFCConnecticut Haha, thanks. Won‚Äôt be in Ireland.
Here‚Äôs FIFA‚Äôs official World Cup ‚Äò26 bid evaluation report for North America and Morocco https://t.co/1E4CUrKFmb
@howardmegdal üòÄ
World Cup ‚Äò26 bids: North American bid gets 4.0 rating out of 5.0 from FIFA. Morocco gets 2.7.
@TotalSoccerShow Thanks! Loving your WC group preview episodes.
@TheGinaMiller @ESPNMichele Thanks!
@ESPNMichele I‚Äôm excited!
Hearing now that both the North American and Moroccan bids will go through to be voted on for the World Cup ‚Äò26 hosting rights on June 13.
@WilliamsBob75 @fuboTV Thanks Bob‚Äîsaw the full-length doc for the first time yesterday and was blown away
@DavidAmoyal Thanks David!
FIFA may release technical reports on North America and Morocco‚Äôs World Cup ‚Äò26 bids today. There had been questions over whether FIFA committee might remove Morocco from the process for that 48-team tournament. https://t.co/LZRqo2qCrU
Diehard listener, but finally got to be a guest on my old SI cubemate @richarddeitsch's podcast. Fun discussion on all things World Cup, LeBron's 2002 SI story and the wild and wooly world of mixed-zone interviews. https://t.co/VoAScDRGx3
@MikeChizNH @richarddeitsch thanks!
@BenHCarrington @Karembeu Nice!!
@HerPitch I really don‚Äôt have a good NPR name, unfortunately
@calcul8id Yes
@Raphael_Gellar Thanks!
Been listening to NPR all my life. Thrilled to be doing regular appearances during the World Cup on NPR's Morning Edition, All Things Considered and Weekend Edition.
@SI_PeterKing Thanks Peter! Beernerdness: If you haven‚Äôt tried Iceland‚Äôs Einst√∂k, I would highly recommend!
@gkellynyc @fuboTV The whole 35-minute doc turned out great.
@rebsdg Think you'll like it!
@mitchgoldich Thanks Mitch!
Coming Monday on https://t.co/FaPitGl62P @fuboTV and Amazon: By far the most ambitious SI Video project I've ever been involved in. A roadtrip around the perimeter of Iceland to tell the best underdog story of the World Cup. Here's the trailer: https://t.co/IK3LWdXXWJ
@lmechegaray @SInow Congratulations! An absolute pleasure working with you every week.
@leefeiner @fuboTV ‚Äúglam‚Äù
@BegleyChris @johannagara Thanks!
My friend @johannagara informs me these women are doing expert game commentary on TV (not studio shows) for the men‚Äôs World Cup: Aly Wagner (USA), Viviana Vila (USA), Vicki Sparks (UK), Lise Klaveness (Norway), Hanna Marklund (Sweden). Are there any others?
@emmabaccellieri I see what you did there üòÄ
@mfatta7 @MoSalah Thanks! My sense was it reflected the agent more than Salah. But I also realize there are sensitivities having covered Aboutreika‚Äôs story in 2013.
@mfatta7 @MoSalah Thank you! Very impressed by him during our interaction.
@BryGuyJD Thanks!
Loved visiting Iceland and learning how its soccer culture has led to the nation's incredible global rise. A classic underdog story that transcends sports and provides lessons for the United States https://t.co/i8ifVkXRQl https://t.co/XTsTaeVlBu
@MickeysView Makes sense. More money in CFB. I‚Äôm more of a hoops guy.
@MickeysView No college basketball coach who gets an offer from a bigger school ever requires compensation going from the bigger school to the smaller school to get released from his contract.
Sorry, but I didn‚Äôt say that. https://t.co/WY3Sht4nxi
@DavidAmoyal Yeah. Not sure why so many are thinking there‚Äôs zero chance Poch can move now.
Always fascinated that coaching contracts in US college basketball and football are instantly breakable, but that‚Äôs not the case in other sports like soccer. That said, no reason Daniel Levy couldn‚Äôt negotiate massive compensation from Real Madrid and do a ‚Äútransfer‚Äù with Poch. https://t.co/P4nnN0yM0Q

@gkellynyc It‚Äôs fun how often the story resurfaces...
@DanaWessel @gkellynyc Been lucky to be involved in a few. But this one is up there with Women's World Cup '99, Where's Daddy? and a couple other ones.
The editors at Sports Illustrated asked me to share some of my memories from reporting our 2002 cover story on LeBron as a high school junior https://t.co/bDzzDtdhZ9
‚ÄúThe Chosen One" was on SI's cover as a HS junior:  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really understand what it truly meant to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated‚Ä¶ The cover pushed me onto the national stage, whether I was ready for it or not.‚Äù  My story from 2002: https://t.co/fXZ4hLAp0d https://t.co/GpUq8sdfRx

The outpouring of Real Madrid players posting gratitude to Zidane on social media shows how much respect he has. Also a reminder that players speak by not speaking when most coaches leave a job.
Peru star Paolo Guerrero will play in the World Cup after all following Swiss Supreme Court decision. A nation breathes a sigh of relief.
@pourmecoffee Lol
@komandnaya The only job I can see him taking at some point is France national team.
Always found it fascinating that Zidane‚Äôs France ‚Äò98 coach, Aim√© Jacquet, won the World Cup at age 56 and never coached again. Going out on top is so rare in the coaching business.
Zinedine Zidane leaving Real Madrid after winning 3rd straight Champions League title. Smart in a lot of ways.
Yes, Panama and Costa Rica are in North America. My mistake. Read @BrianStraus‚Äôs story. It‚Äôs terrific. https://t.co/4DOtO82zJb
Mexico plays more games on U.S. soil than it does at home, and it regularly outdraws its rival USMNT here. It's North America's only team in the World Cup, and its fandom north of the border is only growing. @BrianStraus on the United States of El Tri https://t.co/0r8sO3hd4d https://t.co/X5tsZvaybo
@PaulCarrTM Don't tell anyone those were the two words I drew out of the hat that I then had to get into the story...

@nwblackmon Thanks Neil!
@Wright_One Thanks!
@byrrrne @BR0leary He did an interview with CNN as well. But in terms of written publications, they said there was nothing and they turned down interviews with NYT, Washington Post and others. Take it for what it‚Äôs worth, but I trust them on that.
@BR0leary @byrrrne Nor does that appear to be a publication.
@BR0leary @byrrrne I‚Äôm just telling you what his people told me. This was the only WC interview and photo shoot that he did ahead of WC. What you‚Äôre showing doesn‚Äôt contradict that.

Find it fascinating how many Americans who cheer for US national teams think America refers only to them, as if millions of American citizens might not root for a national team other than USA. Intriguing linguistic exercise today. https://t.co/TlpLcjVhvb

@JuliusCesar25 @CH14_ @HirvingLozano70 @11carlosV If you read it this way, that means you‚Äôre presuming that ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù is a direct synonym for ‚ÄúUSMNT fans.‚Äù That is not close to accurate.
@KHeneage Thanks Kris!
@JuliusCesar25 @CH14_ @HirvingLozano70 @11carlosV America includes millions of citizens whose team is Mexico.

@PhilippeAuclair Think we‚Äôll be following this storyline for a few weeks. Egypt obviously wants to create optimism.
@_ToddBeane Sorry, disagree with you on this one.
Update from Egypt national team: Salah expected to be fit for World Cup. Vamos a ver. https://t.co/4zsfneKih5
@WillieOReeFan I did credit him.
Hoping Mohamed Salah isn‚Äôt out of the World Cup. Might throw up if that ends up happening.
@ShawnBlymiller Sure. Nobody pointing a gun to their heads to comment on it.
Odd to hear first comments from Bale/Ronaldo after winning Champions League be about their agents and future. Just celebrate today. Worry about the other stuff later.
Worse epic screw-ups in huge games?
From a human perspective, the most interesting player to follow over the next week is Loris Karius. Can only imagine what it will be like.
Liverpool sitting on a lot of money. Donnarumma (or even Buffon) would be an upgrade at goalkeeper.
If Gareth Bale leaves Real Madrid, that‚Äôs a good way to go out. Incredible.
We‚Äôve got a game. 1-1. My bar in Brooklyn erupts.
Liverpool: Weak goalkeeping for as long as anyone can remember.
Sergio Ramos has had dirty plays over the years. The play on Salah wasn‚Äôt one of them.
There‚Äôs no crying in soccer? There‚Äôs lots of crying in soccer ... if you go out injured in a final. Hope Salah and Carvajal are OK.
@lmechegaray Sorry, bud
Shad Khan: I like this Wembley Stadium. Might have to buy it.
Tim Ream was terrific today. Best performance by an American in the playoff final since Jay DeMerit with Watford.
Congratulations to Fulham, which beats Aston Villa in the playoff final and advances to the Premier League next season. So few Americans in the PL these days, but US‚Äôs Tim Ream and teammates earned it.
@ShawnBlymiller @Arsenal Thanks!
@Matt5cott Then we‚Äôre on the same page! (I swear I‚Äôm an Anglophile, Matt.)
Fulham up one but now down a man. Every big moment in this game has come after a terrible first touch.
@Matt5cott It‚Äôs a joke, Matt. Where‚Äôs that famous British sense of humor?
Enjoyed this New Yorker story on Mohamed Salah https://t.co/2oGL9230vd
Some of these folks at Wembley should consider wearing more sunscreen.
@cbfowler I had a positive experience there for Euro 2012 final. Though parts of the city felt vaguely sinister.
Fulham goes ahead. Sessegnon play to catch up with his own bad first touch saved it.
@Terry_T_Mark No worries! That was actually one of the title names being considered at one point.
@mobilesworking Should be, yeah
@Terry_T_Mark Awesome. Thank you!

So I got ratio‚Äôd (often hilariously) for saying I‚Äôm picking Mexico to beat Brazil in the World Cup Round of 16. Admit it would be an upset, but look at their recent head-to-head record‚Äîincluding several with Neymar involved. Players are also very much behind Osorio. https://t.co/xyTlxkw1l0

@Jackie_Bizzle Suspect that's why Arteta didn't get the job in the end. He wanted more control than they were willing to cede.
Important word choice in Arsenal's official tweet: Unai Emery is the "head coach." Very specific job of preparing the first team to play. He isn't a "manager" responsible for long-term strategy and player acquisition. Big departure from the Wenger-dominated previous structure. https://t.co/BoPdgXa9Qq

@TSCPolitics No single player won that World Cup‚ÄîScurry was huge; I wrote about her in a big SI story the previous week‚Äîbut the success of that team was based on a group of players who viewed their success as a collective effort, basically the opposite of what you're saying.

@kevvwill Yeah, seriously
@gabsschb @TheWilderThings https://t.co/YxfYmVlyxK

@76placidcasual @albertjschulman @JohnBrewin_ @james_corbett @marthakelner As should any of ESPN‚Äôs journalists when they had a rights deal with FIFA? That makes sense.
@76placidcasual @albertjschulman @JohnBrewin_ @james_corbett @marthakelner USA English, USA Spanish, Canada. Countries where other sports are dominant in November and December as opposed to the June-July quiet period in North America.
@76placidcasual @albertjschulman @JohnBrewin_ @james_corbett @marthakelner Sorry, just don‚Äôt follow. Company A and Company B have contract. Company A changes parameters in way that would cause Company B to lose millions. Company A: Please don‚Äôt sue us. Let‚Äôs negotiate a new contract that both sides are satisfied with. Same with Fox as Telemundo.
@SamBorden Congrats Sam!
@76placidcasual @albertjschulman @JohnBrewin_ @james_corbett @marthakelner The extra payment part if WC26 is in North America makes sense for all the North American TV companies and for FIFA. Failing to see any shadiness here. Not do I receive any personal benefit if World Cup is in USA, Morocco or Neptune.
@76placidcasual @albertjschulman @JohnBrewin_ @james_corbett @marthakelner Have never hidden that I work for Fox Sports. No writer working for a company holding TV rights (including John‚Äôs days at ESPN) should have to declare it in every story. TV contracts should generally be open-bid, but FIFA created a huge problem by moving WC22 dates post-contract.
@kjchanusmnt @BrianStraus @AviCreditor Same here!

@bonitamersiades @james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Pretty hard to be critical of FIFA‚Äôs problems‚Äîincluding the insanely excessive gift-giving culture‚Äîwithout getting your own house in order first. IOC banned bid junkets for journalists. FIFA should too.
@JM8999 @BrianStraus Thanks!
A well-updated version of the classic from @KuperSimon and @sszy is definitely worth the read https://t.co/mGng98FT2i
@SaintTone95 @BrianStraus Thanks for tracking it down!
@JohnBrewin_ @james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual You guys can try to circle the wagons on this and make it about other things, but the job is the job, and journalists accepting thousands of dollars in free travel from the people you cover isn‚Äôt even in the gray area. Full stop.
@bonitamersiades @james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual I‚Äôm not responsible for what any of those people/orgs do. But I do know the basics of journalism and that journalists/outlets don‚Äôt have have a gun to their heads to accept thousands of dollars in free travel.
@Marcotti @marthakelner Heard about that‚Äîand that Don Garber and other MLS folks canceled too
@Marcotti @marthakelner Nice. Not there, unfortunately. Sounds like an interesting conference.
This is a great story for Mother‚Äôs Day by @WulfESPN about his family and Bambi Wulf, who gave career chances to so many of us and left us far too soon https://t.co/mDluIf2zu0
@JuanG_Arango @Marcotti @marthakelner I did. Paid for by Sports Illustrated. Wondering now if we should include that as a line in all our stories.
@Marcotti @marthakelner You‚Äôre in Miami?
@76placidcasual @james_corbett @marthakelner I recuse myself from writing about the soccer TV business. You seem to lack the ability to judge false equivalencies here.
@76placidcasual @james_corbett @marthakelner It was a rational decision by FIFA, which would likely have lost more money from losing a lawsuit to Fox, Telemundo &amp; Canada outlets than by giving a discounted WC26 to those companies. SI has dealt smartly with my conflict by having coverage of soccer TV by Deitsch/media writer.
@76placidcasual @james_corbett @marthakelner Sounds like you have an issue with FIFA‚Äôs decisions, not Fox‚Äôs. No TV company in the world, including ESPN, would have acted any differently than Fox did in what was a rational business deal for all the North American TV companies that got WC26 rights after the WC22 date switch.
@daveschechter Thank you!
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Sounds like you have an issue with Americans. Financial pressures are similar in US media. It‚Äôs how you respond to it that matters.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual So we agree on that, and we agree that it‚Äôs a bad situation that journalism budgets for travel have gone down. We just don‚Äôt agree on the way to respond to that.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual SI paid thousands of dollars to send me to Doha in 2013 for a balanced story. The Guardian took a massive freebie from Qatar and produced this: https://t.co/ggqBB6RojT
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual So you‚Äôre acknowledging that maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with taking these massive freebies?
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual IOC has rules against it for a reason. Nobody is forcing you to accept those thousands of dollars.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual North American bid is struggling. I honestly don‚Äôt care who gets it. But I don‚Äôt think this was the point of our conversation.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual You seem to be making this less about a black-and-white policy that really matters and more about personal stuff. The scale of the freebies being given to journalists here is breathtaking https://t.co/5mnrOM2S4s
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Yeah, Juan Ruiz. That‚Äôs why we have a policy. I follow it.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Our policy says nothing worth more than $100. This has literally become an exercise in Trump-level whataboutism. Is this a hill you want to die on?
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Doubt it. But not accepting travel from the people you cover is Journalism 101.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual If Sid had known, he wouldn‚Äôt have done it. Mentioning their names isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It‚Äôs transparency.
@marthakelner Journalists who accept paid travel from the people they cover are typically pretty quick to rationalize it in my experience.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Apparently that policy is to allow accepting free 5-star travel from the people you cover. Sid is a terrific writer, but the fact here is the only SI writer violating SI‚Äôs policy was a Guardian writer. (And it was overlooked by a British SI editor.)
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Yes, that was the one I suspected you‚Äôd refer to. Totally against SI policy, and https://t.co/5rBd4yJSew soccer editor at the time (Jen Chang) should have been clear about it. But at least we have a policy.
@76placidcasual FIFA switched the ‚Äò22 WC dates to November/December and felt like it would save money by doing what it did than being sued by several North American TV companies.
@james_corbett @marthakelner @76placidcasual Did you confirm with the SI writer that he/she had it paid for? Who was the SI writer? I‚Äôve been on international media availabilities to European clubs where UK journalists there were paid for and SI covered all my costs.
@marthakelner This culture of bids/companies providing journalists with thousands of dollars of 5-star travel is of a piece with the extreme gift-giving culture that helped make FIFA a cesspool in the first place. It‚Äôs designed to influence, and it works.
@marthakelner There's a reason the IOC doesn't permit free travel junkets by bid groups. FIFA should do the same.
@marthakelner Hi Martha, yes, better to declare than not. But accepting thousands of dollars of free 5-star travel from the people you're covering isn't in the gray area. I'm ambivalent on USA hosting WC26, but I also saw the Moroccans got out their message of improper behavior by competitors.

@marielstoll More than a decade ago, Sir Alex Ferguson saw him and was interested in bringing Shea to Man United. Squandered potential.
@MattDoyle76 Yeah. Just seems surprising that the model would predict that chance would be missed 35% of the time by a player.
@MattDoyle76 Was there really a 35% chance he would miss that sitter?
@patricksandusky @olyphil That‚Äôs insane. Would love to see a story where the topic is addressed in honest and open terms, though.
If there‚Äôs a symbol of the lost generation of US Soccer (ages 24 to 28) that failed to qualify for the World Cup (and the Olympics), it might be this from Brek Shea. https://t.co/3UrDjuAeU2

@JSCollinsAP Perhaps. England and Italy seem to have zero patience whatsoever.
@MarkEccles5 @mixedknuts Thanks! Feel free to interrupt my ramblings and say hello next time!
@joekrishnan Possible! But doubt it.
Prediction: Never again will a Premier League manager have a tenure at one club even half as long as Ars√®ne Wenger‚Äôs 22 years at Arsenal.
From a US perspective, it‚Äôs unfortunate for Wenger that the Premier League became truly visible and popular in the US only after 2004. Not enough Americans saw or remember his finest moments.
Ars√®ne Wenger announces he‚Äôs leaving Arsenal at the end of the season. A transcendent tenure that produced some fantastic memories. (Though truth be told, this should have happened a few years ago.)
It‚Äôs not every day that you randomly run into other Americans working in soccer on a train in the UK. Awesome to finally meet @mixedknuts in person. https://t.co/hXozcebRvr

One of the coolest sports moments I‚Äôve ever seen in person was Old Trafford fans giving Brazilian Ronaldo a standing ovation after his Champions League hat trick against Manchester United in 2003. Similar respect today from Juventus fans to Cristiano Ronaldo.
Juventus capitulates. Real Madrid rampant. Stunning.
Thiago puts Bayern up 2-1 at Sevilla. Order restored.
Love moments when fans applaud a player from an opposing team for a remarkable piece of skill. Respect for Ronaldo.
Damn, Cristiano Ronaldo still got it.

If I cut the cord today, what is the best option for me to see the top European leagues, MLS out-of-market, Mexico, Libertadores, international soccer, etc, that includes DVR and/or archived games?
Best window into Atlanta soccer culture that I've seen. This is really happening. Good stuff, @ayyy_west and @COPA90US https://t.co/lmDam3J4ji
@adybec Congratulations!
Back when I covered college basketball, I wrote about John Beilein and the innovation‚Äîread: massive amounts of trial and error‚Äîthat results when you become a head coach at a young age https://t.co/4peB9hJrHe
@SchuetteFaced Thank you!
Unbelievable sports weekend.
Between Zlatan and the women's Final Four games, this has been a ridiculous sports weekend so far. Hoping the men's Final Four games can keep up.
From @DrJoeMachnik: "I have just seen Stuart's Tweet photo and it is safe to say that he was behind the ball at the moment the ball was played, and the ball is what counts in this regard as the ball was closer to the goal line than any of the defenders.  ONSIDE!" https://t.co/BZpzRenWte
Zlatan's LA Galaxy debut: Most indelible moment in MLS history https://t.co/uXq5msbrtq
All the big moments here in Zlatan's belief-defying LA Galaxy debut. https://t.co/pz9qDsY7s6
Pretty entertaining 1st game between LA Galaxy and LAFC https://t.co/0YLZxqAZeR
Trying to imagine what would have happened if VAR had overturned this. https://t.co/cvcLdxVON7
@lovefutebol Ha, probably true!
I'm just glad Zlatan didn't take his shirt off again and get sent off.
Still can't believe this happened. https://t.co/kzP9ZLVi66
I don't even care. What a game. Unreal. https://t.co/1W5CwUej8y
Zlatan winner. My god.
Unbelievable. One of the great moments in MLS history. https://t.co/AQIUXbhQq2
ZLATAN!!!!!!!!!
Zlatan's on, and LA Galaxy has pulled back 2 goals to make it 3-2 LAFC. This is fun. On FOX now.
@PaulCarrTM lol
This is soul-crushing for LA Galaxy.
@awaiters86 Denny Green, is that you?!?
LAFC is an MLS buzzsaw, and it hasn‚Äôt played a home game yet.
@ryan10_jones @PhilSchoen Why? NFL has a salary cap. It's just incredibly high.
@bah777 Kneejerk from Bayern winning the Bundesliga year after year after year?
Looking WAY down the road: If MLS ever does get world-class players in their prime on par with the top European leagues, a more even playing field will be a huge selling point for MLS. HT Bayern Munich 5, Dortmund 0.
Solid impression of Washington Generals defending by Borussia Dortmund all season long. My goodness.
VAR is odd sometimes.
Pulisic starts for Dortmund vs Bayern Munich. Worth not having him come for USMNT friendly. 12:30 pm ET kickoff on big FOX. https://t.co/KeTWcgHg7O
Correction: It‚Äôs actually 5 straight hours starting at noon ET. https://t.co/BrcX5JbXze
4.5 hours of soccer today on big FOX? Yes, please. Bayern Munich-Dortmund at 12:30 pm ET, LA Galaxy-LAFC with Zlatan Ibrahimovic‚Äôs debut right after that.
Exhausted. What a game.
Great basketball doubleheader.
Good stuff on a quick turnaround from LA Galaxy. (Plus, Pierre Barrieu is the man.) https://t.co/Z0nWG8PFBe

If I were talking about the best-performing foreign signings in league history, that's a different ranking altogether. David Villa would be near the top. So would Robbie Keane and Bradley Wright-Phillips. https://t.co/EfSjuGOmWB
Love everything about Ibra joining LA, but keep hearing it's MLS's 2nd-biggest foreign signing after Beckham. My ranking: 1. Beckham (5-year deal at age 31) 2. Thierry Henry (4.5-year deal at age 32) 3. Sebastian Giovinco (5-year deal at age 27) 4. Ibra (2-year deal at age 36)
@LabidouA Maybe a bit, but he could still get so much more on the open market.
Also sent Zlatan's superagent, Mino Raiola, an email asking: Dude, how could you let him sign for just $3 million over 2 years? Haven't heard back yet.
Intriguing sports biz tidbit: Recently learned Zlatan doesn't have a shoe deal right now but wears Nike because he likes it. Introduced his own clothing line last year. https://t.co/L6Tj3CTe8N

@dvits14 Thanks‚ÄîI agree on Bob.
The most popular soccer team in the United States continues to be the Mexican men's national team. https://t.co/yPY4jI6aoi
@JerRasso That‚Äôs a completely inaccurate presentation of what I said. Go back to the original statement: There are more fans of pro soccer, the sport, in the United States than of ice hockey. To say otherwise is not accurate.
This isn‚Äôt complicated. NHL is bigger than MLS for now. But pro soccer (all of it, from around the world) is a lot bigger than ice hockey in the US today. If you want to say 4 major leagues in North America, NHL is there. If it‚Äôs 4 major sports, soccer &gt; ice hockey. https://t.co/mTGPPx0LKI
@cammiebuckeye33 If you think MLS represents all of soccer in the US, you‚Äôre clueless.

@TwoPennyBeer Plenty of questions if he's a DP for those reasons. But complete no-brainer if he's on a TAM deal.
For anyone wondering if LA Galaxy signing Ibrahimovic is a good move, signing him for 2 years at just $1.5 million/year is an absolute no-brainer.
Wondering if anyone has informed Zlatan yet that he's not a Designated Player...

Concacaf Champions League semifinals: Toronto-Club Am√©rica and NY Red Bulls-Chivas de Guadalajara.
@Galloots Interesting. Hard to argue with any city that doesn‚Äôt want to agree to FIFA‚Äôs demands.
3-0. Comprehensive thumping of Seattle by Chivas. Said before quarters that 1 win in 3 would be MLS meeting expectations, so 2 of 3 (Toronto and RBNY) will still be exceeding them.
Diana Ross will have to miss that penalty kick somewhere else this time. https://t.co/3G0itJ6WzD
Seattle no doubt regretting all those missed chances in the first leg.
At this point, Seattle‚Äôs best hope may be Obafemi Martins running onto the field from a secret location in the stands.
L√≥pez puts Chivas ahead of Seattle. Where is the Seattle goal going to come from? Standing 8 count.
Golazo from Chivas on the free kick. Skeleton crew Seattle still even, but in trouble.

Courtois player rating today?
Don‚Äôt feel like Chelsea has played badly, other than the Courtois error. Just some exquisite quality in moments for Barcelona.

@alan_ilitzky When you haven't won anything against Liga MX in games that matter, it's a historic moment when you do.
Toronto eliminates Mexican champion Tigres and advances to the semifinals of Concacaf Champions League. With NY Red Bulls eliminating Tijuana earlier tonight, a huge evening for Toronto, New York and MLS.
GOAL TORONTO‚ÄîGiovinco with yet another classic free kick golazo. And now Tigres needs 3.
Vargas answers for Tigres. 3-2 (agg) to Toronto, and you know that Tigres is going to come with all its firepower now.
@richarddeitsch Would be pretty huge to eliminate the Mexican champs. Just one goal ahead now...
Osorio did add that he likes Damm as a pure crossing threat and wants to see him play in Europe. https://t.co/VLAq4tQIoM
Someone should tell Auro that J√ºrgen Damm has no left foot. I know this because Juan Carlos Osorio once told me: "J√ºrgen Damm has no left foot."
GOAL TORONTO‚ÄîMLS champs ahead of Tigres 3-1 on aggregate midway through the 2nd half in Monterrey.
NY Red Bulls advance to Concacaf Champions League semifinals with 5-1 aggregate dismantling of Tijuana. Tigres-Toronto (1-2) return leg of Liga MX champion vs MLS champion up next.
@IrisCisneros_ Para m√≠ tambi√©n!
Hell of a counter by NY Red Bulls, and their 2-goal advantage is back.
Huge night for MLS teams in Concacaf Champions League for the next 4 hours. Games are on Univision Deportes (in Spanish) and go90 (in English).
Nope. It's not about which team is better. It's asking which contract extension was a bigger surprise/more confounding. https://t.co/AOgqphGFwo
@gordonhill54 ? Not sure why that makes a difference.
More perplexing contract extension: Mourinho at Man United or Wenger at Arsenal?
Sevilla slays Manchester United at Old Trafford. Roma also advances past Shakhtar to UEFA Champions League quarterfinals. That English-teams-excelling storyline faded quickly.
All United needs to do is crank up that vaunted Mourinho attacking machine and they‚Äôll be fine.
It was. All you need to do is win at home, and if you can‚Äôt do that you don‚Äôt deserve to advance. https://t.co/5FQA26Qzy2
If I was the Sevilla coach, I would have run down the entire touchline in front of Mourinho to celebrate.
Wow, Ben Yedder scores for Sevilla. Man United needs two. Death silence in my bar.

@aplusashley I like the sound of that!
@aplusashley No, but hoping to get there soon! Hope you‚Äôre doing well.
72,000-plus in Atlanta for an MLS game. Not even a surprise anymore, but it's pretty incredible. https://t.co/8hQY7cYFEw
Two games in LAFC's history: A 1-0 win away at Seattle and now a 5-1 win away at Salt Lake. Next LAFC opponent: LA Galaxy.
@dunord If it makes you feel better, you will never hear me say "Crew SC"

New pod: Steve Nash discusses his new job covering Champions League for B/R Football and Turner; plus author @sebabbot on his new book ‚ÄúThe Away Game‚Äù (subscribe, rate, review) https://t.co/UxkcqsLqmK
FT Seattle 1:0 Chivas. Just the first leg, but all 3 MLS teams have leads against Liga MX teams heading into the return legs.
GOAL SEATTLE‚ÄîDeuce from Wingo. It's 1-0 late against Chivas.
Do Chivas and their coach really need to wear winter gloves in Seattle?
Credit to Univision for showing Concacaf Champions League games. It's not just about the games. If you watch their soccer talk shows, CCL is a big topic. This tournament matters for MLS's reputation in ways that don't show up in English-language media.
FT Toronto 2:1 Tigres. Two first legs in CCL, two advantages to MLS over Mexican teams. Are the times changing? Seattle-Chivas about to kick off on UDN.
Imagining Gignac talking French smack to Bradley is great fun.
GOAL TORONTO‚Äî2-1, and that is a huge one from Osorio.
People new to soccer always ask me: What's the most important stuff to watch? In this part of the world, the answer is: NOW. Watch Toronto-Tigres in a game that matters on Univision Deportes.
Game on. 1-1 between the MLS and Liga MX champs. Get thee to Univision Deportes pronto!
Quality from Vargas. Toronto has to respond.
@jas2781 They are good at it!
Probably should keep in mind criticizing Concacaf playing surfaces in Caribbean and Central America when you see the field in Toronto tonight.
FT USWNT 1:0 England. Own goal makes the difference. The old Mystique may not be there, but USA finds a way to win the SheBelieves tournament.
@kenbensinger apparently
England, @whatahowler.
Trying to get used to saying Concacaf, but not in ALLCAPS.
@SaintTone95 @SiriusXMFC thanks for following/listening/reading!
Packed night: USWNT-England, 7 pm ET, ESPNNews; Toronto-Tigres, 8 pm, UDN; Seattle-Chivas, 10 pm, UDN.
Why do Argentine forwards play so much better for their clubs than for their national team?
Gut punch for Tottenham.
@Sportsviking All good. If he doesn‚Äôt score once in two games I‚Äôm worried about the guy!
@Sportsviking ? That‚Äôs referring to a different game on a different day in which Gonzalo didn‚Äôt score.
@dubois Think I mistook Juve‚Äôs lack of urgency for them basically saying, We got this.
Cold-blooded 5 minutes from Juventus. Wow.
Someone should do a graphic on all the places Barzagli has kicked Son (including the 4 times in 2 seconds with no foul called).
Son should be able to get that Korean military service requirement filled if they win Champions League, right?
Once asked Clint Dempsey who were the most talented players he had ever played with. Didn‚Äôt hesitate to say Mousa Demb√©l√©.
Main focus is Spurs-Juve, but keeping an eye on Man City-Basel to see Phil Foden.
@TimFroh Clips of LA‚Äôs reluctance have mentioned a few (security officials and financial risk). Might also want to check the FIFA website, which may have more specifics.
Los Angeles was in danger of being left out of the World Cup '26 bid, but I'm told that LA has now accepted FIFA's terms and will be part of the bid https://t.co/uL8F48Av0J

Highly entertaining Chivas-Am√©rica rivalry game right now on Univision. 1-1.
@PagingDrVol Nope. The referee is still judging the recklessness of the ACTION on the attempt, not what the referee thinks is going on in the player‚Äôs mind. (Judging intent on handballs is a silly exercise, but such are the Laws.)
INTENT üëèüèº HAS üëèüèº NOTHING üëèüèº TO üëèüèº DO üëèüèº WITH üëèüèº ANY üëèüèº FOULS üëèüèº OTHER üëèüèº THAN üëèüèº HANDBALLS

@GMeenaghan Thanks!
Terrific performance from Wilmer Cabrera‚Äôs Houston to thump Atlanta 4-0. Central midfield remains a concern for Atlanta, and first-half defending was abysmal.
MLS preseason favorite (Toronto) loses 2-0 at home. MLS No. 2 preseason favorite (Atlanta) down 3-0 after 26 minutes.
@aNateScott I'm going to call it a day now
Houston: #WengerIn 1-0.
Klinsmann at Chivas de Guadalajara would be interesting, whether it's as technical director or coach https://t.co/wGzIQNYXPV
Good to see @Nicocantor1 on the Univision broadcast of Houston-Atlanta with @raulguzman, @DiegoBalado and @elcondek.
@RobAbramowitz @TigresOficial Going to need to play better in that game. Going to be a cold one!
@PaulCarrTM I'm hoping to start a collection
@4totera Obviously, yes. Orlando City looked pretty good the first month of 2017.
@herculezg Most of their guys were above average. Good runs from Zardes. One-time finish. Think I'd like playing his position on this team.
Nobody at Sports Illustrated picked Columbus to make the MLS playoffs üëÄ
Deserved 2-0 win for Columbus at defending champion Toronto. Terrific work from Artur, Pedro Santos, Higua√≠n, Valenzuela. Toronto already with as many home league defeats as all of last season.
And ... Dybala with the stoppage-time winner for Juve. So strong in the box on the finish. https://t.co/BrvOCpW22t
Well, at least one Higua√≠n is scoring right now. Federico puts Columbus up 1-0 at defending champion Toronto.
Sort of hoping the president of Liberia doesn‚Äôt try to persuade his son to play for Liberia instead of USA.
@herculezg @Tim_Fontenault My friends were much better at the timing than I was.
@herculezg @Tim_Fontenault Never could totally figure out the Bull Charge
@joedacar Compared to Lazio-Juve it most definitely is
American 18-year-old Tim Weah coming on for his debut for PSG.
MLS Live may be in its dying breaths, but it‚Äôs showing live MLS games for free now. MLS season opener Toronto-Columbus at 1 pm ET.
@WxveFC Would be great for him to make his debut, but come on.
@TheMikeDonovan Yeah, true
Today‚Äôs best game in Italy (Lazio-Juventus) can‚Äôt be seen on US TV right now because BeIN Sports (whose owner owns PSG) is showing a meaningless PSG Ligue 1 game.
@HenryBushnell Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing Weah get on
@HenryBushnell Ha, who owns BeIN again?
@IanDarke Sorry Ian. That‚Äôs a long drive.

@AlexiLalas @MLS How many of these guys were stand-in models who actually didn't play pro soccer? I recall at least a few of them, right?
@JamesPiotr @AnAbnos A bit nicer! (Not the rocks.)
Why MLS as a "retirement league" is nonsense: Only 1 of the last 35 designated players who has been newly signed to the league has been in his 30s (Bastian Schweinsteiger).
New podcast: Megan Rapinoe talks USWNT, NWSL, how she and Sue Bird discuss vision in soccer/hoops, and why she hopes more white athletes become allies to Kaepernick and others https://t.co/i6ZjR09anO

@shinguardian I need to do more reporting on it, but I'm hearing MLS had the chance to change to what should have been a more favorable schedule but opted not to.
@abnerha Also, a friend tells me my earlier tweet was uncool and too personal. Upon reflection, I agree with him. I apologize, Abner.
@PedroAreIIano Yep. Thought that was an appropriate look on my face!
@abnerha That's cool. You do good work. I'm frustrated with MLS on this topic. Been following since '96 as well https://t.co/GN2FCAgQnm
@KerosLowder Nah. It's a decade of MLS losing in this tournament.
@abnerha I understand it's harder to see that if MLS is signing your checks.
@abnerha Not really. MLS has done a lot of good things, but US Soccer (and US soccer) needs more accountability.
Dallas craps out in CONCACAF Champions League to Panama‚Äôs Tauro. I‚Äôm tired of hearing excuses. If MLS says it wants to be one of the world‚Äôs top leagues, it‚Äôs way past time to be better than teams in Mexico (and Panama) https://t.co/JEeMF7mp4s
@MLSist legend
Dallas face-planting at home against Panama's Tauro in CCL. FCD needs at least 3 goals in the 2nd half to survive.
@eddie_robinson2 @samonty22 @dang90 Eddie, you have no clue how much I know on this topic. Don't confuse disagreeing with someone's opinion with claiming they don't have information on it.
@eddie_robinson2 Country‚Äôs leader calls African countries ‚Äús‚Äî-holes,‚Äù tries to ban entry of citizens from Muslim countries. Country shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when other nations don‚Äôt want to reward it with World Cup.
Things I'm psyched about: Toronto vs Tigres, MLS champion vs Liga MX champion, in the next round of CONCACAF Champions League. Things I'm not psyched about: MLS's record transfer, Atlanta's Ezequiel Barco, missing 4-6 weeks with an injury at the start of the new season.
Lot of people have no idea that World Cup host voters have changed from two dozen to more than 200 since Russia/Qatar votes. https://t.co/9qft6GoaYa

@RobHarris Yeah, brain lock on my part. Was thinking 50 not 100.
Glorious free kick from Fred. Shakhtar leads Roma 2-1.
Terrific poise in the box by Ferreyra to equalize. Shakhtar 1:1 Roma.
Roma better than expected all season in Champions League and doing the business again away to Skakhtar. Cengiz √únder puts Roma up 1-0.
