LeBron James' Lakers falling to 11th in the West is obviously a massive story, but allow me to mention another whopper that impacts the same playoff race: San Antonio just went 1-7 on its annual Rodeo Road Trip #whoa
When the Knicks unexpectedly became part of Sunday night’s Oscars, it was the latest (and maybe loudest) reminder that the conversation about tanking — more than tanking itself — is what unnerves the NBA. Column for SportsTuesday in the @nytimes: https://t.co/6q4imuBGC6

My position should be pretty clear by this point -- Let New Orleans shelve Anthony Davis for the rest of the season! -- but can we at least all agree it's time to scratch the notion that sitting AD is some huge tanking offense? They've been a tougher out without him for a month
My fault, @TKokkinakis

More from the NBA’s Mike Bass on New Orleans and Anthony Davis: ”The Pelicans were advised that the team had not identified a proper basis for making that determination at this time and league rules governing competitive integrity therefore require that he be permitted to play.”
NBA spokesman Mike Bass tells @NYTSports on the Pelicans and Anthony Davis: “The NBA did not tell New Orleans that it would be fined $100,000 per game if Anthony Davis were held out for the remainder of season ... (QUOTE CONTINUED IN NEXT TWEET)
Important to note, as we look at this season’s various players in trade limbo, JR Smith and Zach Randolph (to my knowledge) mutually agreed to stay home until a trade solution is/was found. But Carmelo Anthony and Chandler Parsons, like Anthony Davis now, did not mutually leave
Another player who spent the whole season in “exile” until the Kings traded him to Dallas last week ... https://t.co/90cJ2a8BUP
@TenPercentNinja Anthony Davis was fined because the trade request was made PUBLICLY. Trade demands are perfectly legal if they are not made public and Davis is completely within his rights to ask to be dealt. On Point No. 2, very valid criticism of the Pels: Fines do appear to be worth it here
@SansCheese Wrong on every level. For starters: We’re not gong to treat every NBA player equally now? It can’t matter how starry (or not) they are. Secondly: New Orleans’ aim here is to protect Davis from a serious injury that makes the player who has requested a trade untradeable. That’s it
If Anthony Davis wants to exercise his right to request a trade, his team should be able to exercise the right to not play him until the trade is made
The Pelicans are being held to a standard that the NBA has not held other teams to this season. A very healthy Carmelo Anthony was essentially exiled by the Rockets in November. Memphis' Chandler Parsons and Cleveland's JR Smith, too https://t.co/Bil6Ci8M1G

Also: If the action of the past week leading into this trade deadline wasn't enough ... you greedy A(   )
The Boston Celtics, possibly at their own risk, are officially part of the Anthony Davis Sweepstakes as the Pelicans keep Davis beyond the 2019 trade deadline
The Knicks plan to keep DeAndre Jordan but intend to grant Wes Matthews a buyout once the trade deadline passes, league sources say. Matthews is at the top of the buyout brigade with expected interest from Indiana, Golden State, Houston and maybe more.
We will soon pass the 20-trade marker in the space of a week — starting with the Porzingis Blockbuster last Thursday — if we’re not already past 20
The Pelicans and Lakers have had no Anthony Davis trade conversations today, according to league sources
Trade deadline almost here and all signs overwhelmingly point to Anthony Davis, as expected, staying with the New Orleans Pelicans for the rest of the season. Less than 40 minutes left for the biggest of trade buzzer-beaters
Add March to a long list of free-agent vets teams will be pursuing starting at 3:01 PM today ... https://t.co/B8HFcY2qOs
What's going on at the top of the East is exactly what this league so badly needs. There has to be good, meaningful basketball for the game to shift the focus away from The Transaction Game

Philly (Tobias Harris), Milwaukee (Nike Mirotic) and Toronto (Marc Gasol) all make big moves this week ... and Boston (presumably) has to save all of its chips for an Anthony Davis trade in June
Confirmed https://t.co/P8d7V8p5Y2
Nets re-acquire Caris LeVert https://t.co/DwqkmsyelC
New team in the hunt for Wes Matthews if he secures a buyout from the Knicks: INDIANA. Philly, Golden State and OKC have been frequently mentioned for Matthews, but the Pacers clearly have a sizable void to fill after the  All-Star guard Victor Oladipo's season-ending knee injury
FOUR
Hearing that the Mirotic trade will net New Orleans four second-round picks
There will be a good (albeit) untested team in the Finals from the East when the Warriors get there
The Hornets are pushing hard to find a new home for Frank Kaminsky and there are some murmurs they might have success before today's 3 PM deadline
At Grizzlies shootaround this morning, Mike Conley says he'll play anywhere he's traded https://t.co/SGl2g5K2Tt
There were seven trades in the NBA yesterday. If today's business drags all the way to the deadline that would be understandable
Utah, meanwhile, has not abandoned its pursuit of Mike Conley, league sources say, even knowing Conley's preference is to go to the East if he is dealt today. As discussed here yesterday, Memphis may decide its trade options for Conley broaden by waiting until closer to the draft
The Hornets were not able to acquire Harrison Barnes but continue to engage with Grizzlies on a Marc Gasol deal, I'm told. JaMychal Green is also attracting interest on what could well be a busy day in Memphis
Harrison Barnes and agent Jeff Schwartz were apprised before Wednesday's game that Barnes was being pursued by Sacramento and Charlotte, league sources say. The Kings' offer won out and Barnes, as explained by Paul Pierce late last night on ESPN, opted to play rather than sit
Zach Randolph appears headed for what will be a sizable buyout market after Sacramento dealt him to Dallas in the Harrison Barnes deal. The Mavericks, I’m told, won’t necessitate that Randolph reports

@SopanDeb Pierce (retired) and Barnes (now Sacramento-bound) are both repped by Jeff Schwartz …
@NYTSports The Pelicans have not yet disclosed their intentions regarding Davis should they elect to keep him past Thursday's 3 PM deadline. Davis wanted to play in both of New Orleans' games this week but was understandably held out by the Pelicans
@NYTSports Sources say Davis, meanwhile, remains adamant that he will not sign a long-term deal with Boston if the Celtics trade for him in July and that he would like to play out the rest of the season for the Pelicans if there's no trade by tomorrow's deadline
@NYTSports The Knicks could still try to trade for Davis before the deadline or wait until after the draft lottery in May, when the world will know how strong their top pick in June is. Either way, New York has ample encouragement to pursue a Davis trade before its big free-agent summer
@NYTSports Davis, I'm told, prefers becoming a free agent in July 2020 to signing an extension with any team that acquires him
@NYTSports And whether he is traded before Thursday's 3 PM trade deadline or in the offseason, league sources say, Davis intends to play out the remainder of his current contract and become a free agent in 2020 no matter where he lands.
Anthony Davis has the Knicks on equal footing with the Lakers in terms of teams he is interested in signing with long-term, @NYTSports has learned. The Clippers and Bucks also remain preferred destinations on his list
No new trades in the last half-hour #sorry
The three-way deal that will land Iman Shumpert in Houston is the NBA's 10th trade since the Porzingis-to-Dallas whopper got the frenzy started ... unless I missed one ... which would be understandable
John Wall's Achilles tear has apparently invalidated the Wizards' vow that neither Bradley Beal nor Otto Porter would be traded https://t.co/gysChyBEpy
Will the trade market for Mike Conley broaden if the Grizzlies wait until closer to the draft in June? The Grizzlies are committed to trading Conley but this is among the variables they are weighing as the deadline draws near
The Raptors are not presently pursuing Memphis' Mike Conley, according to one league source, while pessimism is emanating from Detroit about the Pistons meeting the Grizzlies' asking price for Conley. Twenty hours to go before the trade deadline for things to re-ignite
Hate the jumper. Love this team
The hard question for Utah, obviously, is whether to invest so much in a player who doesn't want to be there. Can you win that player over?
Have heard the same as Windy: There is reluctance on Conley's part to go to Utah. That said ... this is not the first time that the Jazz have heard that. Conley is owed $66 million over the next two seasons. If Utah and Memphis came to terms, Conley would have to go ... https://t.co/g4OVNcRkQ1
25 hours to go until the trade buzzer sounds. Don't worry ... more will happen
Memphis is said to be seeking multiple first-round picks in exchange for Conley ... and we have seen two deals in the last week (Porzingis and Tobias) that had teams (Dallas and Philly) willing to go to those lengths
The Grizzlies, meanwhile, continue to press in their efforts to move Marc Gasol (Charlotte in the lead) and Mike Conley (Detroit and Utah are deeply interested but are yet to meet Memphis' asking price)
The Sixers put it on paper: They’re all-in to win the post-LeBron East by acquiring Tobias Harris ... https://t.co/ZLruu3z5D8
Separate from all things Anthony Davis, New Orleans continues to explore trades for Julius Randle and Nikola Mirotic in advance of Thursday's 3 PM deadline, league sources say

@BA_Turner Disclaimer time: The trade deadline is 48 hours away. There is obviously plenty of time for talks to get re-ignited and both the Lakers and Pelicans are trying to create any semblance of leverage since L.A. is basically only team currently in the hunt for Anthony Davis THIS WEEK

The Jazz have undeniable interest in Conley as the deadline approaches, league sources say, but it is a big step up financially from Rubio's $15 million expiring deal. Memphis is believed to covet prime draft compensation in a trade involving either Conley or Marc Gasol
For those talks to progress all the way to a deal, though, would require additional pieces as well as Utah absorbing the two years and $66 million remaining on Conley's contract -- which is obviously steep
Utah has had exploratory discussions with Memphis on a potential swap headlined by Mike Conley and Ricky Rubio in advance of next week's trade deadline, according to league sources.

A deal between the teams appears imminent, league sources tell @nytsports
The Knicks would also receive future first-round draft compensation from the Mavericks and, by shedding the contracts of Hardaway and Lee, create the salary-cap space this summer to pursue two maximum contract free agents
The Knicks would receive Dennis Smith Jr. and the expiring contracts of DeAndre Jordan and Wes Matthews in the proposed trade, according to league sources
The Mavericks have agreed to take on the contracts of Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee to faciliate a Porzingis trade and are working to complete the transaction today, league sources say

Anthony Davis' agent Rich Paul tells @NYTSports he has NOT given the Pelicans a preferred trade destination for Davis. But Davis' July 2020 free agency obviously gives hm huge say in where he lands since no team will surrender meaningful assets for a player it can't re-sign
Asked if the Pels would honor Anthony Davis' request before the Feb. 7 trade deadline, agent Rich Paul told @NYTSports: "They haven't said much, but we wanted to do the right thing to let them know by the deadline so they could do what's best for the organization  going forward."

Also true that typing on an iPhone is evil ...
It is also true that, based on the way the NBA record book works, Luke Walton’s never-to-be-DUPLICATED and utterly ridiculous 39-4 stint as Warriors interim coach in 2015-16 goes all on Kerr’s record.
Also: I fear everyone is officially afraid of the Warriors again
Steve Kerr needs only 377 games to record 300 wins, as covered in this week’s @nytimes NBA newsletter, breaking Pat Riley’s record (416) by nearly 40 games

It will be Nowitzki's sixth career entry into the Long Distance Shootout ... in his 21st (and possibly last) season. The lifelong Dallas Maverick won the 3-point crown in 2006.
Dirk Nowitzki has been invited to participate in the 3-point contest at All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, league sources say.
You can also read this week's newsletter to chuckle at your aging correspondent for putting Mike Conley's salary where Marc Gasol's should be. Gasol is earning $24.1 million this season, not $30.5 million.

@bkarbour @BimaThug @AlbertNahmad @BobbyMarks42 Reasonable deduction: Chicago HAD to put the rights to SOMEONE in the trade to make it legal even though the Bulls' willingness to take on Melo's contract is the real asset here … so the Bulls asked Houston to give up the rights to one of its international players to stay "even"
And there it is ... https://t.co/jjEt4ralNi
@TheAthletic The teams plan to officially announce the Carmelo Anthony trade this afternoon, but it appears Melo will have to wait 18 more days -- until the passing of the Feb. 7 trade deadline and clearing waivers Feb. 9 -- to become an actual free agent who can pick his next team
To complete the Carmelo Anthony-to-Chicago trade, Houston had to remove the draft rights to Marko Todorovic and, according to @TheAthletic, will instead send the draft rights of Jon Diebler to the Bulls to make the trade legal
The trade sending Anthony from Houston to Chicago is still expected to go through today, but issues that have arisen over the proposed trade construction illustrate why the league would not execute the trade Monday without the Rockets submitting the required advance notice
The Carmelo Anthony trade call, I'm told, has yet to take place today because the deal sending Anthony to Chicago might have to be amended over a discrepancy involving the rights to an international player

@AlbertNahmad The Rockets just completed the Michael Carter-Williams trade with Chicago
The Cavaliers signed the restricted free agent McCaw to a two-year, $6 million unguaranteed deal that Golden State declined to match. Cleveland waived McCaw after he appeared in just three games, setting up McCaw to become an unrestricted free agent if he clears waivers this week
Not yet clear how deeply the NBA will look into Cleveland's signing and near-immediate release of restricted free agent Patrick McCaw. Asked if they would urge the league to do so, Warriors officials declined comment Monday

Can the Suns attract offers in which they don't have to take back an unsavory contract to match Ariza's $15 mil? That is the question ...
Ariza is on a one-year, $15  million deal with Phoenix. Interested teams have been  hoping the Suns would just buy Ariza out like they did with Tyson Chandler, but they are expected to pursue trades to try to get at least one asset in return
Dec. 15 is the first day players who signed free agent contracts last summer are eligible to be traded and the Suns -- mired at the bottom of the West -- are expected to field interest from contenders in need of wing depth for Ariza
The Suns' Trevor Ariza is seen by rival teams at the top of the list of players who will be made available via trade after Dec. 15, league sources say

Bob McAdoo two weeks ago (https://t.co/tRIXgjvlhS) ... Nique this week. The adjustment isn’t the snap we all assume it should be. https://t.co/fGwZsH4Uyx
It's not often that one of these press releases forecasts an in-season return so confidently. Nets doc: "... (LeVert) is expected to return to full strength and resume all basketball activities without any limitations this season.” https://t.co/nnqP1Ll2Jz

Talked to one NBA coach this week who thinks Tyson Chandler will keep coming up big for his new team. The quote: "He's 36 -- but those weren't high-mileage years for his body in Phoenix."
The Lakers are a touch too excited to beat the (purportedly tanking) Hawks by a point at home ... but it certainly was an inspiring block at the buzzer by Tyson Chandler. (Liked seeing Trae Young try to get to the rim FTW, too)
More from the pregame media sessions in Houston: Rockets GM Daryl Morey said "a lot" of the team's struggles to open the season are "on me" and Coach Mike D'Antoni acknowledged that management is "exploring all options" in the wake of a 4-7 start https://t.co/IutrCmPBXa
Morey just met with reporters in Houston and insisted Carmelo Anthony is still a member of the Rockets https://t.co/Lsx8qFPGFZ
The Rockets have denied they are waiving Carmelo Anthony, but two sources close to the situation say Anthony has been informed that his brief time with the team will soon be ending. Anthony has been listed as "out" for Houston's game tonight against Indiana due to illness
On Friday afternoon, Houston announced details of a Carmelo Anthony foundation event scheduled for Wednesday. On Saturday night there are questions circulating leaguewide about whether Thursday’s loss at Oklahoma City was Anthony’s last game as a Rocket https://t.co/Z3usCTa5uW
Asked tonight if the Rockets were soon parting company with Carmelo Anthony, one source with knowledge of Houston’s thinking insisted the team is “not letting Melo go.” Yet it appears we must stay tuned amid multiple reports about ongoing talks with Melo on his role going forward

Josh Richardson started the season so well -- after the trade didn't happen -- that Miami decided he was now off-limits. Time will tell if Minnesota saved itself today ... or missed out on the better deal https://t.co/ewWkjjEZhJ
The Wolves, remember, could have traded Jimmy Butler for a package headlined by Josh Richardson and a future first-round pick. Instead they balked -- at least twice -- and now have to hope that Covington/Saric is a package that pans out
Wolves wrap up an 0-5 West Coast trip with a 121-110 defeat in Sacramento. The eight-week mark since Jimmy Butler's desire to be traded became public knowledge is also almost here.
What better to do on a wild Friday night ... than send in your questions for the @nytimes' weekly NBA newsletter. Send 'em to sportsnyt@gmail.com (and sign up here: https://t.co/KwfHrDo8bs)
So the scheduled rest games, I'm told, are a measure to try to minimize the risk (for both parties) as much as they can, since the Wolves know they have to move Butler before the Feb. 7 trade deadline or risk losing him for nothing in free agency in July https://t.co/IEXtnABw5h
As I was reminded this week at Staples, once Butler's  competitive juices take over, you know he's going to try to play all 48. His coach Tom Thibodeau obviously has the same mindset. So ... (ONE MORE TWEET IN THREAD) https://t.co/Mbte8BKWkw
But Butler is averaging 35.6 MPG in his nine games to date. He has only landed below 32 minutes twice -- opening night and a blowout L to Milwaukee. Butler logged nearly 40 minutes in Monday's road L to the Clippers that I attended, then 43 minutes in Wednesday's L to the Lakers https://t.co/TQCEHoaZUu
Sources say Minnesota and Butler jointly established a loose limit of 32 minutes for games -- both to ease him back to full speed after he missed training camp but also to try to minimize injury risk for both parties after Glen Taylor promised Butler he would try to trade him https://t.co/1CoMiUPRQF
Jimmy Butler is scheduled to play tonight at Sacramento, but league sources say Minnesota will continue to mix in occasional games of "scheduled rest" for Butler as part of a jointly agreed plan coming into the season
Did NOT realize, until Inside tonight, that Adonis Creed has to deal with a Romanian in Creed II

Tyson Chandler is an LA native and the Lakers' need for interior depth and defensive reinforcements is well known. Chandler is earning $13.6 million this season, which suggests he will clear waivers easily and be able to pick his next team
The Lakers are expected to be at the front of the line to sign Tyson Chandler once he clears waivers, league sources say

Minnesota has decided to rest Jimmy Butler tonight in Dallas … second night of a back-to-back
For sure that, too. Probably even more what you're saying but winning in Utah like that is something … even on Oct. 19th https://t.co/If0yaySZAZ

One potential issue with this "professional path" provision is that it's going to put an even bigger target on the backs of young players who go this route. Hard enough to survive in a league of guys scrapping to get to the NBA and in many cases earning $35,000 or less https://t.co/4A2kC3gGTX

The trade is on course for completion today before 5 PM to enable the Clippers to waive Ajinca — as opposed to just waiving the more expensive Wes Johnson.  The Pelicans want Johnson for wing depth https://t.co/LDo4WT1sp9
The Clippers are in advanced trade discussions to acquire Alexis Ajinca from New Orleans in exchange for Wes Johnson, league sources say
Happy 25th anniversary to one of my all-time favorite shows — CNN International’s World Sport — and honored to visit with @donriddellCNN tonight help them preview the NBA’s 73rd season.

I dare you to come up with a better late Friday night that re-reading and re-watching all the glorious GIFs, tweets and quotes emanating from the Minnesota Timberwolves this week
After playing tonight in Dallas, Charlotte's Tony Parker said he's well aware of the Spurs' "bad luck" with injuries losing "three young guys in a row" in the backcourt but made it clear he has "no" regrets about signing with the Hornets as opposed to staying in San Antonio
Dare I say the Doncic Hype is understandable. NBA-Ready with a capital R ...
Random stat that won’t help the Hornets unless I move to Charlotte someday: Jeremy Lamb is shooting 71.6 percent from the 3-point line lifetime in his games I attend in person
The Suns are courting free agent guard Jamal Crawford, according to @Gambo987 in the desert https://t.co/kondV1QkhM
Hazard obviously a beast. I probably need to stop penalizing him for the season a couple years back that he mailed in. Undeniable monster when he's in his current form https://t.co/gPSCde4tGO

As @NYTSports reported last week, Wolves ownership has been notified that Miami is Jimmy Butler's preferred destination, which is significant given that Butler becomes a free agent July 1 https://t.co/nid1sI613K
Deal specifics are not yet known but the Wolves and Heat, I'm told, have been discussing a trade without the involvement of a third team https://t.co/QAzJmk9tKo
The Wolves and Heat were making significant progress on a Jimmy Butler trade this week, league sources say, before deal changes proposed by Minnesota led to a breakdown in talks

Perhaps the respect Serena deserved -- what she says her top male counterparts would get in the same situation -- is a last warning from the chair along the lines of: "If you carry on in this manner I will have to give you another violation and dock you a game." Did that happen? https://t.co/zHUr78bYP0
(2/2) Just my humble opinion: The warning for coaching was the truly ridiculous part here and Ramos could/should have known he was too punitive at the start and let Serena vent until she got it out of her system. But calling the chair umpire "a thief" is not nothing https://t.co/hmpizbVkgO
(1/2) She questioned the integrity of the chair more than once. THAT's why she got a third violation … it's "language" any chair umpire would at worst put on pair with getting cursed out and probably view it as much egregious https://t.co/cMEsBn3QIb

Where's Timmy to hit us with a drawn-out NANU when we need him?
So, so grateful to have been there for @manuginobili's last game in the Albiceleste of Argentina. Remember an emotionally spent Manu stopping to make sure the English-speaking press got a few quotes amid the post-game madness. From that night in Rio -&gt; https://t.co/YC2ii1AgIE

Before Team USA can dominate the 2019 World Cup in China, @usabasketball's @nbagleague-laden squad actually has to qualify. Coach Jeff Van Gundy doesn't see that as a gimme (at all) as explained in this week's @nytimes NBA newsletter (online version here): https://t.co/tVrvYm2TdP
Anyone else still struggling to process these tweets talking about "Toronto's Kawhi Leonard" and "San Antonio's DeMar DeRozan" like moi?
From Monday's @NYTSports piece on Pop and his forthcoming debut at Team USA head coach ... https://t.co/6R95nCHecM
This won't surprise USAB officials; Jerry Colangelo told me they saw Kawhi's attendance as a "maybe." I would expect USAB to keep the door open for Leonard, since both Colangelo and Pop have said attendance this week is not mandatory, but does Kawhi have down-the-road interest? https://t.co/I4YvHMWItM
From @AlbertNahmad on @kevinlove: Love’s four-year, $120M extension, starting in 2019-20, is $9.7M less than his four-year, $129.7M max extension (and far under the five-year, $221M max contract he theoretically could sign next summer). Love can’t be traded for six months.

Amid the most challenging period of his career, Gregg Popovich starts his dream job this week with @USABasketball. "I think about it every day to some extent," Pop tells @NYTSports of his new gig: https://t.co/u2Q3VLL6h8
TIRELESS and tieless https://t.co/eXrR7xNhKo
Ashamed I forgot the tieless @DannyLeroux ... another cap artiste https://t.co/yf4FLvOAFI
The Mavs are going transaction wild now that they have Dirk Nowitzki under contract. They just signed Chinese swingman Ding Yanyuhang ... who played summer league ball for Dallas in 2017
They're all sensational and make sure @EricPincus and @DLord_DBdotcom are on your list, too https://t.co/bTYkt7opwb
Johnathan Motley was on a two-way contract for Dallas last season; Seibutis and Leunen are former second-round picks who have yet to play in the NBA https://t.co/NZqCd3IgFr
The Mavericks also just traded Jonathan Motley and the rights to Renaldas Seibutis to the Clippers for the rights to Maarty Leunen and cash considerations
If you, like me, find the cap-nerdy subject of NBA no-trade clauses and how hard they are to get irresistible ... allow me to re-share last week's newsletter that went deep on the topic: https://t.co/ezV0HcGCUl https://t.co/v7jXEyzuqb
LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony previously had no-trade clauses but can't get them in their new deals because they've switched teams. And now Nowitzki is a One-Year Bird ... which I shall let @AlbertNahmad explain in smarter language than me https://t.co/BQpf64C0ox
But what makes the absence of a full no-trade clause for Nowitzki interesting -- as we covered in last week's edition of the @nytimes weekly NBA newsletter -- is that it means soon no one in the NBA will have one https://t.co/mhKputQscq
Dirk Nowitzki's new one-year contract with the Mavericks does not contain a no-trade clause, league sources say, because he has automatic veto rights over any trade as a One-Year Bird. So a full no-trade clause was unnecessary
A short time ago on The Jump, asked by my old friend @WindhorstESPN about the topics discussed in this piece, David Robinson said of Pop: "It's been a very tough time for him. It's hard to even imagine him being the one that needs support because ... he's always the tough guy." https://t.co/qaedOTZnqF
After vowing for years he would walk away alongside Tim Duncan, Gregg Popovich actually has two jobs now. Pop's new gig with @USABasketball begins in earnest this week and the Spurs' patriarch discusses it with @NYTSports: https://t.co/u2Q3VLL6h8
I'm sure the clip will be posted later if you missed it live ... some very interesting thoughts on the Spurs/Kawhi/Pop from @DavidTheAdmiral Robinson just now on The Jump with @rachel__nichols

A trade sending Cleveland's Kyle Korver to Philadelphia in exchange for Jerryd Bayless is "possible" but also "far from certain," according to one league source briefed on the talks.
The Mavericks are signing Yogi Ferrell to a two-year deal worth in excess of $5 million, according to league sources

In DeRozan’s case, timing was the culprit. He landed his big contact after his seventh NBA season. Players must have eight years of service time — and at least four with the same team — to be eligible for a no-trade clause. So DeRozan was one season short to even ask for one. https://t.co/XXNB2YYHRS
This week’s @nytimes NBA newsletter delved into the fate of the no-trade clause. They’re VERY hard for NBA players to get and now DeMar DeRozan, like Blake Griffin, seems poised to discover why teams are so reluctant to include NTCs in lucrative contracts: https://t.co/ezV0HcGCUl
One update to the Sixers' foiled pursuit of Daryl Morey: League sources say Philadelphia indeed sought and received permission to meet with Morey, but the Rockets' GM elected to stay where is, having built the league's consensus top threat to Golden State https://t.co/Pz3CIPx0BN
Running it back from last night: Philadelphia’s bold attempt to hire Daryl Morey away from Houston ... https://t.co/B3xhr5IDJk
A Sixers spokesman, when asked about the team's interest in Morey, told @NYTSports that it will be not be commenting on the specifics of its GM search https://t.co/qbHfAuWfkX
The 76ers had great interest in Morey -- freshly voted as the league's Executive of the Year -- to replace the ousted Bryan Colangelo. But Morey couldn't be lured away from the Rockets, with whom he has spent the last 12 seasons. https://t.co/H7ZupxCF7c

The Bucks always resisted calls to trade Jabari Parker and always scoffed at suggestions that he wasn't a fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo. Now they've lost a former No. 2 overall pick without compensation. Not how you expected Parker's tenure in Milwaukee to end

Last one on this topic (for now): Chicago could also choose to use its cap space to try to play the restricted free agent game with one of the top RFAs still available ... or use the space to try to acquire draft picks by proposing to take on bad contracts. The Bulls have options https://t.co/nuCIw6Aboc
The Rockets, as reported Tuesday by @NYTSports, are regarded leaguewide as the unquestioned frontrunners to sign Carmelo Anthony once he clears waivers. Here, again, is the browser version of Tuesday's @nytimes NBA newsletter on Houston's Melo pursuit: https://t.co/DoAAn2zR8l https://t.co/43cq15HuuP
The obvious question for the Thunder -- provided Chicago would be willing to absorb Melo's $27.9 million salary -- is how many quality assets OKC would have to attach to satisfy the Bulls -- and whether that cost is preferable to just waiving and stretching Anthony https://t.co/0qvZg2tr2u
And of course it is Cristiano FELICIO ... I am having the BEST #autocorrect week https://t.co/xnfPdAb4yh
In either scenario -- after a complicated trade or going the simpler buyout route -- Carmelo Anthony is widely expected to become a free agent .. with the Houston Rockets favored to sign Melo once he clears waivers https://t.co/jylH5jVhBx
The Thunder have been working all week to try to find a trade home for Carmelo Anthony so they don't have to incur the considerable full cost of outright waiving him. One way or another, Melo is leaving OKC and it's simply a matter at this point of how soon https://t.co/yBagNpsDnn
A trade that could send Carmelo Anthony to Chicago -- with Cristiano Feliciano going to Oklahoma City -- is now at least mathematically feasible. Check out a series of tweets from @albertnahmad for the full salary-cap explanation

More on the Lakers and DeMarcus Cousins: League sources say they remain Cousins fans but felt they had to pass on signing him now -- even at a reduced rate -- because the Lakers don't share the Warriors' luxury of waiting until January or February for Cousins' return from injury

We've surely crossed the 20-deal threshold tonight. Who is tweeting out the fanciest list?
And a lucrative one-year contract dice roll on DeMarcus Cousins would presumably make it even more of a win in Lakerland https://t.co/LODuldnuh3
The Lakers. for the record, do still win the summer if they get LeBron James
Who else is secretly worried that LeBron is going to wait until something like 5:23 AM ET and unveil his plans?
As with other top free agents in 2019, more money is available to Butler if he plays out his contract and proceeds to the open market next summer, but Minnesota's bid to sign him is no surprise. Butler and a Karl-Anthony Towns extension are the Wolves' offseason priorities. https://t.co/zlZykMeXXm
The Timberwolves began free agency by informing star guard Jimmy Butler that they intend to offer him a maximum contract extension valued in the four-year, $110 million range as soon as he's eligible to sign the deal on July 9, league sources say
Money is so tight that free agents and teams aren't waiting on LeBron James as we've seen in the past. Teams have a finite amount of cash to splash and free agents are grabbing it. Quickly
Right there with Windy. Thought Paul George would take a three-year deal with an opt out after Year 2 at the longest. Incredible moment of triumph for Russell Westbrook, Sam Presti, Oklahoma City, small-market teams everywhere, etc. https://t.co/RfJVM7prZn
No deal can formally be signed until July 6, so both the Mavs and their new center will have to endure plenty of barbs and skepticism until then after what happened in 2015. But Jordan-to-Dallas has been trending this way all week since @NYTSports reported the teams' trade talks https://t.co/G0JodHu7P3
DeAndre Jordan and the Dallas Mavericks have verbally agreed on a one-year deal approaching the $24.1 million option with the Clippers for next season that Jordan relinquished Friday, according to league sources
Kevin Durant and the Warriors have now verbally agreed on their expected new two-year deal worth $61.5 million and featuring a player option in Year 2 that allows Durant to return to free agency in July 2019, according to league sources.
Denver and restricted free agent Nikola Jokic have already agreed on a five-year deal approaching $150 million, league sources say. The deal contains no player option, according to @ZachLowe_NBA, something Denver sought in exchange for declining next season's $1.6 M  team option
Sources close to DeAndre Jordan say he is eager to join the Mavericks and has made that known to some of his potential new teammates, having declined his $24.1 million option with the Clippers for next season to ensure he had the ability to land in Dallas https://t.co/NGUWhJKKHX
DeAndre Jordan and the Dallas Mavericks have scheduled a 12:01 a.m. meeting to immediately launch into free-agent negotiations and are expected to quickly reach terms on a new deal tonight, according to league sources.
I think what we've really underestimated is the partnership Paul George and Russell Westbrook have built. "This is a friendship decision to stay in OKC as much as anything," one rival executive tells me

The new deal would pay Durant $30.5 million next season and allow the two-time reigning Finals MVP to return to free agency in July 2019 -- three months before Golden State moves into the new Chase Center in San Francisco https://t.co/Q3qklVsrkz
Durant is expected to be one of the first deals struck when the NBA's free-agent marketplace opens Sunday at 12:01 a.m. ET. Warriors GM Bob Myers has said repeatedly since Golden State's second consecutive title that Durant will get "whatever he wants" contract-wise https://t.co/kf0iiQjTne
Kevin Durant plans to tell the Warriors after 12:01 a.m. ET that he wants a new one-year contract with a player option for 2019-20 to return to free agency next summer, @NYTSports has learned
Amen ... https://t.co/uwrJQPxzp6
To clarify: This rule was instituted in before free agency last summer and teams were reminded in a June 11 memo that they were clear to schedule free agent meetings with players as of noon ET today -- essentially 12 hours before the marketplace opens https://t.co/Y7IXGDzBid

One more thing, y'all: Only 24 hours to go
The Mavericks remain the favorites to sign Jordan. Dallas, remember, has created roughly $28 million in salary-cap space and -- as you may remember from July 2015 -- will make the longtime Clipper its No. 1 free-agent priority when the market opens Sunday at 12:01 AM ET https://t.co/8fVecmD7j7
Such a move would require Jordan to take a deal starting at the taxpayer midlevel exception of $5.3 mil -- which would cost the Warriors more like $27 mil next season. But it has been whispered around the Warriors for months that they will at least explore making a run at Jordan https://t.co/YMkABpbq3v
The Warriors know this has a marginal chance of success, but league sources say they intend to at least explore their free-agent chances with DeAndre Jordan, who is not only close pals with Kevin Durant but also one of GM Bob Myers' former clients
The Mavericks, in a mutual decision with Dirk Nowitzki, are declining Nowitzki's $5 million team option for next season and plan to hash out a new contract with him in July, according to league sources. Full @NYTSports coverage: https://t.co/czXwb3EMow
The Mavericks did not want to surrender draft compensation in a potential trade with the Clippers for DeAndre Jordan and prefer instead to pursue him in free agency, league sources say
The Mavericks will make DeAndre Jordan their top target in free agency after Jordan informed the Clippers that he will bypass next season's $24.1 million player option to become a free agent, league sources say
DeAndre Jordan update: One source with knowledge of the Clippers’ thinking says they are NOT opposed to the idea of taking back Wes Matthews in a Jordan trade, which does keep some hope alive for an opt-in-and-trade scenario
Can we say you're opting in now? https://t.co/9jYw0fHdqR
The Clippers are resistant to taking Wes Matthews back in a trade for DeAndre Jordan, league sources say, which means Dallas must either present an alternative trade scenario L.A. accepts or try to sign Jordan in free agency if he indeed declines next season's $24.1 million https://t.co/JcF22FAetY
DeAndre Jordan's decision to opt in or opt out of next season's $24.1 million will drag into Friday, league sources say, with a buzzer of 11:59 PM (EST) for the decision
This doesn't guarantee Kawhi Leonard is going to the Lakers this week -- since San Antonio could always trade him elsewhere and/or drag things out -- but league sources say of the Spurs: "They're ready" to move on from Kawhi

One source described a Jordan-to-Dallas trade as a "long shot" ... but the fact it's on the board is the strongest indication yet that the sides are willing to engage again after Jordan's about-face in 2015 free agency when he committed to the Mavs and then went back to the Clips https://t.co/RtYuckP40H
Among the various options DeAndre Jordan has been weighing,  according to league sources, is opting into the final season of his current contract (at $24.1 million) before Friday's midnight deadline to facilitate a trade -- with Dallas, sources say, among the teams interested

Just to clarify on Kevin Durant: Friday's deadline compels Durant to opt IN on his $26.3 million for next season if he chooses, but league sources say he has already informed the Warriors that he will let the deadline pass quietly so he can become a free agent July 1

But have to say I am just as intrigued to see if the Warriors succeed in buying a second-round pick. They can offer up to $5.1 million but have met with a shortage of willing trade partners after all the heat Chicago took for selling them the Jordan Bell pick in 2017 for $3.5 mil https://t.co/Y3mCF1a29F
The Warriors are drafting Jacob Evans at No.28, league sources say
Protections on the 2019 first-round pick Atlanta will receive from Dallas in the Luka Doncic deal, per league sources: 1-to-5 protected in 2019; 1-to-5 in 2020; 1-to-3 in 2021; 1-to-3 in 2022; fully unprotected in 2023. Dallas obviously hopes it conveys next June

No one knows the Suns better than @Gambo987. Check his track record. Breaks TONS of Suns news. It's the NBA ... things can change quickly. Especially on draft night. https://t.co/Dw7Fi4mRey
League sources say the Clippers have been trying to lure the Spurs into Kawhi Leonard trade talks with an offer featuring their two lotto picks and Tobias Harris, but it appears they'll be making the 12th and 13th pick for themselves — with Michael Porter Jr. still on the board.
The Mavericks will now draft Trae Young for Atlanta and nudge Orlando in the direction of Mo Bamba at No. 6
In his final NBA season, Dirk Nowitzki will be mentoring Luka Doncic. Good theater ...
Dallas will send a future first-round pick with various protections over the next five seasons to Atlanta along with No. 5 to acquire the third overall pick from Atlanta, league sources say
The Hawks are going to be drafting for Dallas at No. 3, league sources say
The Mavericks are closing in onclosing on a trade for Luka Doncic, according to league sources
The Sacramento Kings are about to make it official, league sources say, and draft the player they've been calling "their guy" ... Marvin Bagley III
The Suns are about to make it official and select Deandre Ayton with the No. 1 overall pick, according to league sources
The Hawks also sought an unprotected future first-round pick in the Matthews/Bazemore scenario, according to one league source https://t.co/NGH3EzPXtP
If the Mavericks hold firm with this position, it's because they like the options at No. 5 -- such as Mo Bamba or Wendell Carter Jr. -- better than the idea of taking on an extra season of Kent Bazemore at $19.3 million for the right to draft Luka Doncic https://t.co/tQK2tILe62
The Hawks and Mavericks are still talking, according to league sources, but Dallas is unwilling to trade No. 5 and Wes Matthews for No. 3 and Kent Bazemore. Such a move is essentially paying $19.3 million to move up two spots in tonight's draft
With Deandre Ayton widely expected to go No. 1 overall to Phoenix, league sources say Sacramento has lasered in on Marvin Bagley with the No. 2 pick in tonight’s NBA Draft
Washington's aim, sources say, is trying to construct a Marcin Gortat trade without including the No. 15 overall pick https://t.co/nseswjDY3t
The teams that can comfortably absorb Gortat in a trade tonight are Dallas (cap space) and Portland (trade exception) but the list obviously broadens if the Wizards were to reach a verbal agreement on a trade with a team that has the requisite cap space to absorb Gortat in July https://t.co/1YOznWIwaG
The Wizards are actively exploring their trade options with Marcin Gortat, but league sources say Washington is thus far resistant to the idea of surrendering its No. 15 overall pick tonight just to dump Gortat’s contract, which has one season left.
Detroit is making a hard push to hire Bucks assistant Sean Sweeney -- who has worked as closely with @Giannis_An34 as anyone in Milwaukee -- to join new Pistons coach Dwane Casey's staff, according to league sources

Phoenix and Charlotte did seek and receive permission from the Pelicans to interview Chris Finch for their recent head coaching vacancies, league sources say https://t.co/uoVQpelFHW
New Raptors coach Nick Nurse was an assistant coach under Finch on Great Britain's Olympic team in 2012 and naturally had strong interest in trying to bring Finch and his offensive stylings onto his bench in Toronto https://t.co/YX4W83rbAr
Toronto requested permission to hire Chris Finch away from Alvin Gentry's staff in New Orleans, league sources say, but the Pelicans denied them permission, valuing Finch's contributions in his first season with the Pels highly
The Grizzlies, meanwhile, continue to receive significant trade interest in the No. 4 pick in scenarios where they would also send out Chandler Parsons.

Dwane Casey was an undeniably worthy winner having overseen a 59-win team and a dramatic change in style which wasn't nearly as simple as everyone makes it sound given Toronto's personnel. That said ... it's still hard to fathom how Stevens failed to get a single vote out of 29 https://t.co/Ed46ThjA4I
Some potential answers, Griff: 1) As explained in our @NYTSports story, N.B.C.A. ballots only ask coaches for one name.

Thought going in that LeBron needed to score 45 for the Cavs to survive this Game 7. Might have to up that at this rate ...

Suspect it will be noted in Indianapolis that Paul George and the Thunder exited the playoffs on the same night the Pacers forced a Game 7 in Cleveland
Haven't stopped whining about how bad the 2017 playoffs were ... but this first round hooked us up
The Knicks have ramped up their background work this week on both former Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer and former Cavs coach David Blatt, according to league sources. They've interviewed both within the last five days

Sota’s shooting tonight is realistically unsustainable but they got a lot out of seven guys in a pretty must-win Game 3 and will send a long-suffering fan base home happy. For the moment ...
It took 15 shots in 19 minutes but the Wolves’ bench sure seemed giddy to welcome Derrick Rose and his 17 points back into their arms heading into that last timeout
Some encouraging and, yes, fun minutes tonight in ‘Sota from a certain Derrick Rose ...
From a purely observational perspective: Frustration with the Blazers’ playoff sweeping is understandable ... but pinning all this on the coach who helped a team with the frontcourt issues Portland has secure the West’s No. 3 seed strikes me as an incomplete picture
The mumurs have already started In coaching circles that 10 consecutive playoffs defeats will cost Terry Stotts his job in Portland, but league sources say Orlando would register immediate interest in Stotts if he becomes available

Let's not pretend that the shade going back and forth between Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell is a problem. Because these "dramas" fuel this league and (almost) everybody on here loves it

The Warriors, I'm told, badly wanted to avoid this outcome but also felt that they need to keep all of their bigs (Zaza, West, JaVale, Looney and Damion Jones) for the postseason grind to come
Because he was not waived by March 1, Omri Casspi is ineligible to appear in the playoffs for any other team this season
Very harsh numbers game catches up to Omri Casspi, who league sources say turned down more lucrative interest last summer from Brooklyn to go for a ring on a minimum deal in Golden State, only to be forced out when the Warriors had to manufacture a roster spot by Sunday for Cook
The Warriors just announced that they've waived Omri Casspi to create roster room for Quinn Cook

Nowitzki decided to play through the left ankle impingement that plagued him throughout this season and his mobility was severely hampered at times, but the Mavs' hope is that today's procedure helps in that department

League sources say @usabasketball is adding Santa Cruz Warriors swingman Damion Lee to Jeff Van Gundy's @FIBAWC qualifying roster to replace Canton's Marcus Thornton, who is signing a 10-day contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers today
The Cavaliers initially targeted Kendrick Perkins to fill this spot -- to the point Perk posted an "I'm back" picture on Instagram on Feb. 8 before deleting it - but the Cavs decided they needed more than locker-room presence https://t.co/jBvF35Yrtx
Cleveland's decision to sign Marcus Thornton from the Canton Charge out of the @nbagleague means Jeff Van Gundy will have to make one more roster tweak before @usabasketball's plays its next two @FIBAWC qualifiers on Friday and Monday

You'll recall Brandon Jennings, as the 10th overall pick in 2009, scored 55 points for the Bucks against Golden State in his seventh NBA game
Earlier today @AdamJ_NBAGL reported that Brandon Jennings had signed with the @nbagleague and entered its player pool. Wisconsin sat No. 1 in the waiver order
The Wisconsin Herd of the @nbagleague have claimed former Bucks draftee Brandon Jennings, according to league sources
With the All-Star break fast approaching, league sources say it’s increasingly possible Derrick Rose’s future won’t be resolved until after the break when teams resume practicing
Julianna Hawn Holt, who succeeded Peter Holt as Spurs chairman in March 2016, told @ksatnews in San Antonio that the couple’s impending divorce will not lead to the sale of the team. "We are dedicated and committed to continued success," she said in a statement to KSAT-12

The Wolves continue to have great interest in adding Derrick Rose and will explore the possibility of claiming the former MVP off waivers now that Utah has released him, league sources say

In this era of the 3-ball, Cleveland shows us something new: The desperation three-trade heave. How will it all turn out? On Pro Basketball column for @NYTSports --&gt; https://t.co/XBTNI1WvlQ
Sense is that the Kings would work with Carter on a buyout if a tempting potential landing spot emerges between now and March 1 but their hope is that he elects to stay https://t.co/TISYtWxtNK
Early read in Sacramento per league sources: Joe Johnson will definitely get his buyout, but the Kings would love for Vince Carter to stay through the season
The Mavericks have no current plans to buy out big man Nerlens Noel, according to league sources. To the contrary, Dallas is hopeful it can get Noel back on the floor after the All-Star break and make another run at establishing a role for him.
Kemba Walker named All-Star replacement for the injured Kristaps Porzingis
Great to see the tireless @EricPincus breaking down salary-cap matters on @NBATV. Smart, smart kid ...
The Cavs feel as though they need Kendrick Perkins’ strong locker-room presence to help them with the big adjustment period looming after today’s series of trades, league sources say
57 minutes left ...
Strong expectation in Cleveland that one of the Cavaliers’ soon-to-open roster spots — barring any more trades — will be filled by Kendrick Perkins
With Tom Thibodeau in charge, Minnesota is a natural landing spot for Derrick Rose, who has interest in a reunion, league sources say
The Timberwolves will try to sign Derrick Rose if he clears waivers after his looming release by Utah, according to league sources
Only three hours left for NBA trades ... but three weeks of Buyout Market mayhem to come
They would likely need a third team to help facilitate, but the Raptors have tried to work their way into the DeAndre Jordan trade mix, league sources say
Alonzo Gee, Travis Wear, Terrence Jones, Larry Drew II and David Stockton are among the NBA vets chosen for the @usabasketball squad to face Mexico during All-Star Weekend and then play for Jeff Van Gundy in two @FIBAWC qualifiers this month, according to league sources
Watching Utah today will be fascinating, with some 20 teams said to have inquired about Rodney Hood. Does Dennis Lindsey resist the interest and keep Hood ... but also allow him to become a restricted free agent July 1?
For a deal to go down ... it would ultimately hinge on San Antonio's willingness to part with a first-round pick. They'd naturally rather not
Danny Green and a first-round pick for Avery Bradley is one potential trade construction that the Spurs and Clippers have discussed, league sources say
The Clippers are seeking a first-round pick to surrender Avery Bradley, who just arrived in LA via last week's Blake Griffin blockbuster
The Spurs have emerged as a trade suitor for the Clippers' Avery Bradley, according to league sources

Tonight is a prime example of why OKC, for all its flaws, is so intriguing. The Thunder have always believed they're good enough to win a series with the Warriors. How many teams really have that swagger?
The Warriors are in the midst of their first spell of vulnerability in forever ... and you can scarcely give it any attention on the same night Porzingis suffers a season-ending knee injury
The Cavs have lost their last eight games on ABC, ESPN or TNT ... and play 13 of their remaining 30 regular-season games on one of those national channels
There also continues to be considerable trade interest in Hawks forward Ersan Ilyasova, but Ilyasova can veto any trade as a One-Year Bird and to this point has shown little interest in relocating
The Hawks have informed veteran sharpshooter Marco Belinelli that he is on course to be traded by Thursday's 3 p.m. deadline, league sources say. Atlanta said to still be weighing its options in terms of exactly where it will send him with multiple teams interested
The Celtics are chasing that extra first-round pick in Marcus Smart trade talks in hopes of flipping it in a deal for either Lou Williams or Tyreke Evans, league sources say

The NBA names Goran Dragic an All-Star to replace the injured Kevin Love, announcing he was next in line in the voting among Eastern Conference coaches
One of the more interesting areas we covered here (https://t.co/2IweJN9Mnu) with @GeoffCameron: The huge influence @clint_dempsey has been on his career and establishing yourself in England as an outfield player —&gt; https://t.co/vUBAZLC9sv

Veteran scorer Joe Johnson is angling behind the scenes for a trade out of Utah, according to league sources. Will be interesting to see if he becomes a buyout candidate for contenders should no deal materialize before the Feb. 8 trade buzzer

The Sixers have expressed trade interest in Tyreke Evans, according to league sources, but Memphis continues to seek a first-round pick in an Evans deal and Philly is naturally reluctant to surrender it
HARDEN https://t.co/jVcY3L51Up
The coaches’ vote isn’t revealed. The league is expected to simply announce Wednesday that whoever replaces Kevin Love had the next-highest vote total from the coaches behind Andre Drummond https://t.co/5qR2xDTx7M
It would appear James Hardwn disputes the assertion that his recent hamstring thing stunted his MVP campaign ...
The NBA, in announcing Andre Drummond’s All-Star selection, confirmed he was next in line in the voting among East coaches and that’s why he was chosen to take John Wall’s place
Andre Drummond just announced as John Wall’s All-Star replacement
The Clippers’ true trade motivations? The palace intrigue in the Pistons’ front office? Quick and easy sign-up and it’s all here for you ... https://t.co/t7x6uVlih0

The Blake Griffin-to-Detroit trade is on course to be finalized and announced tonight, league sources say
The Bucks just announced that Jabari Parker has been medically cleared to make his season debut Friday night against the Knicks
The Clippers clearly believe they can make it onto LeBron James' free-agent short list come July and, according to league sources, will indeed move DeAndre Jordan and Lou Williams before the Feb. 8 trade deadline if they can find workable deals to help them in that quest
Just as important, though: Blake Griffin was indeed eligible for one last summer even though he had only been on the floor for seven seasons because he had actually been in the league for eight entering the 2017-18 campaign
Quick (but important) reminder: No-trade clauses in the NBA are only available to players with eight years of service time and four with the same team

DeMarcus Cousins and Mike Conley ruled out for the season this weekend and similar fears surround Andre Roberson. Someday ... somehow ... someone has to invent the no-injuries mode button for real life
Reinforcing what was said last night. Fairest play from the NBA when picking an injury replacement is to go to the next name on the coaches’ list https://t.co/wCQoqB739R
Paul George will this join Team LeBron for the Feb. 18 All-Star Game in Los Angeles and give Oklahoma City a dash of consolation on an otherwise rough day given the Andre Roberson injury news
The NBA has named Paul George as the All-Star injury replacement for DeMarcus Cousins
An incredibly nice man who meant a lot to numerous NBA players has passed away. This is Dwyane Wade's tribute to Henry Thomas ... RIP Hank https://t.co/2neIU6jJen
As we covered in a recent @nytimes NBA newsletter, New Orleans has been planning to offer DeMarcus Cousins a five-year max deal in the $175 million range on July 1 and widely expected to re-sign him immediately. The calculus involved obviously just got a lot more complicated ...
Basketball loses tonight
The Pelicans were trying to do it different. They were making some great progress, too. Warriors/Pels in the first round could have been so fun
Would really rather talk about All-Star implications later ... but since so many of you are asking be advised that the league does often turn to the next-closest reserve in the coaches’ voting when it’s time to make an injury replacement selection
The Pels were playing so well.  And Cousins was playing so well en route to his first career trip to the playoffs and heading into free agency. Brutal development on so many levels
There are a lot of NBA fans right now hoping that the DeMarcus Cousins injury is somehow one of those that miraculously ends up being not as nasty as it looked

Sources say KD knows he was the No. 1 pick ... https://t.co/JGpmpjCWl6
Yup! At midcourt on Feb. 18 before tipoff with players wearing reversible jerseys depending who picked 'em https://t.co/qj9v1fsgL9
How do we factor in the change in the value of the franchise over that time? https://t.co/lwjAXKqAvs
But the numbers we don't know: How many millions has LeBron's return pumped into the Cavs' coffers over the past four seasons? https://t.co/hhanvyI86b
Wrong. They wouldn't trade their equipment CEO/enforcer Al Whitley for three firsts ... https://t.co/3YNuacym2s
It would take a first-round pick to get him, because Dallas sees him as one of its culture-setters, but league sources say that the Mavs would part with Wes Matthews before the Feb. 8 trade deadline  if they can get a first in return
LeBron James and Stephen Curry will hop on a conference call this afternoon to pick the All-Star rosters. Who’s excited? That’s right ... pretty much no one. @NYTSports column: https://t.co/2C9i14yf0J
My understanding is that the new captains-pick-their-teams format was indeed hatched with the full intention to televise the draft. But union pushback -- NOT unanimous pushback, but enough -- scuttled the plans to put it on TV
I suspect that we will be talking about the covert-ops NBA All-Star draft all day ... so let's open the floor

Rockets whisper from tonight: Provided it has roster room, Houston is hoping to bring back veteran guard Bobby Brown after the Feb. 8 trade deadline
Haven’t been around here for a minute ... so can someone please explain to me why Salah Mejri’s nickname would ever be changed for Salah The Ballah to The Mej?
Channing Frye’s $7.4 million expiring contract would certainly feature in any Cleveland/Sacramento swap and Frye would likely become an immediate candidate on the buyout market, league sources say
The Kings will extract some sort of draft comepsation if they go ahead with the proposed trade of George Hill to Cleveland for Iman Shumpert and Channing Frye, according to league sources
The Bucks are among the topics covered in our latest NBA newsletter ... which comes right to your Inbox when you subscribe here —&gt; https://t.co/tB9vuAmCdG
Will be fascinating to see what Milwaukee does now in the wake of Jason Kidd’s dubious dismissal. Trade deadline is Feb. 8 and the Bucks — who’ve had Giannis, Middleton and Jabari together for ZERO minutes over the past two seasons — have been actively seeking roster upgrades
The Bucks were among the teams that engaged Charlotte in Kemba Walker trade talks before Michael Jordan’s pronouncement that he’d rather not deal Walker, according to league sources.

Link to the @nytimes latest on the Cavaliers’ attempts to reshape their roster by pursuing trades for DeAndre Jordan, Lou Williams and George Hill —&gt; https://t.co/xJil7exHMX
The Cavaliers have allso registered trade interest in the Clippers’ Lou Williams, according to league sources, with Cleveland vets such as Tristan Thompson and J.R. Smith featuring in various trade proposals.
It remains to be seen if the Cavs have the assets to acquire one or both of their top targets, but league sources say they are in active pursuit of both. @ShamsCharania first reported Cleveland’s interest in Hill.
The Cavaliers are pursuing separate deala for DeAndre Jordan and George Hill in advance of the Feb. 8 trade deadline, according to league sources
Bogut ranks as the most accomplished defensive big man on the market since parting ways with the Lakers, but sources say interested teams have a shown a desire to maintain maximum roster flexibility through the trade deadline before making free-agent signings.
Andrew Bogut is being courted by a multiple playoff teams and is expected to sign with a new club after the Feb. 8 trade deadline, according to league sources

On the locker-room door part of the story: League sources say the commotion caused by Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green getting into the Clippers' locker room was already underway and prompted Tarik Black -- NOT Capela -- to approach the Clips' front entrance before being turned away
Predictions GALORE in the first edition of our new @nytimes NBA newsletter: https://t.co/xjPQy4AmAe
Also told today that DeAndre Jordan, as the closest Clipper to the door when Trevor Ariza and the other Houston players got inside LA's locker room, was key in keeping things from escalating
Hearing strongly today that Clint Capela was not the Rocket who appeared at the Clippers' locker room doorway Monday night ... belief now is that it was Tarik Black and not in any sort of diversionary tactic

The Kings just answered one question posed in today's @NYTSports NBA Power Rankings --&gt; https://t.co/azhQqiWXIe https://t.co/BHmMN1sqVz
Can they get DeAndre Jordan? Do they have a better deal looming that no one sees yet? Whatever it is Cleveland HAS to swing big to give itself every chance to convince LeBron to stay ...
One trusted source pulled me aside at the @nbagleague Showcase last week in suburban Toronto and insisted that the Cavs will "definitely" swing at least one deal before the Feb. 8 trade deadline. But is there really one deal out there that closes this gap?
You said it, Bones: Gamers. Not talking speed. Just paying homage to the zillion ankle sprains Dirk has played through ... https://t.co/Z6GkqY9AaQ

Preliminary estimates on Utah’s Thabo Sefolosha are that he will miss at least six months, league sources say
There are fresh fears in Utah that Thabo Sefolosha’s knee sprain suffered Friday night in Charlotte could be a long-term injury, league sources say. Definitive diagnosis is expected this weekend.
Today is the finale for the annual @nbagleague Showcase outside of one of the world’s greatest cities: Toronto. League sources say that moving the event to Las Vegas — also home to the NBA Summer League — is a strong possibility for next season.

Important to note: If the Bulls pick up their team option on Nikola Mirotic for next season before trading him, Mirotic would lose his current veto power over a trade as because his current contract would become a two-year deal.
Agree with @KCJHoop. Word is the the Bulls are determined to get a first-round pick in a Mirotic deal https://t.co/0uJYBZmbVz
The prospect of Mirotic being moved before the Feb. 8 trade deadline looks increasingly likely, league sources say, with a deal potentially hinging on the level of draft compensation Chicago gets
The Pistons have joined Utah in expressing trade interest for Bulls forward Nikola Mirotic, according to league sources

Ummm ... there was this team called the Lakers that posed a bit of a problem. Was just discussing this with Mr. @PeterVecsey1 the other day: People forget how good the best Milwaukee and Dallas teams were in the '80s cause they didn't win it all. STACKED! https://t.co/477yNXXray
Derek Harper (@d_harp_12), Ron Harper (@harper04_5), Rod Strickland (@rod_strickland) and Eddie Johnson (@Jumpshot8) ... absolute stalwarts from the '80s and '90s who were all so unlucky not to earn at least one All-Star berth
Favorite part of my chat with Harp this week: No. 12 doing a New York accent recalling his greeting from fans in his early days with the Knicks in 1994: "Hey Harper, it's been a week now, how f------- long is it gonna take for you to do something?"
The great Derek Harper on Sunday's looming jersey retirement at halftime of Knicks at Mavs: "I've tried to downplay it like it's not a big deal. But the more you look up at the rafters at different places when I travel around doing the broadcasts, you realize it is a big deal."
