Taking off for SF! See you at @TheChapelSF tomorrow night. Question for you denizens: What are the best art/design destinations in the city?
@EmsyB12 @TheChapelSF That WAS in the works, I‚Äôm not sure what happened. No one tells me anything.
@JasonWallace84 Better to separate them, but it takes practice. I do a whole lot of miming when I‚Äôm recording acoustics. If it sounds weird, just do it all at once‚Äîbut don‚Äôt mess up!
I‚Äôm in San Francisco this weekend for a one-off at @thechapelsf Sunday night. Hope you can make it! Requests? https://t.co/XPQ5Ia4sBQ

http://t.co/hDld9FCH
I gave this really honest interview to a Ohio state paper, but we have to cancel tonight because my voice sounds shit.
Hi all.  It's been awhile.  Getting ready for a show in Minneapolis...
I reckon if you're pooped on by a bird, and in good enough spirits to say it's good luck, you're probably going to have a good day anyway.
Show tonight at anthology in San Diego!  Soundcheck sounded great, should be a good night.  Requests?
About to go on stage in San Francisco!  Been awhile...  Psyched!
Thanks for all the recommendations!  Starting to get pretty crazy outside.
What's your favorite movie you've seen recently?
I want one of those snazzy red CNN windbreakers.  #waitingforhurricaneisgettingboring

Yes! http://t.co/miEWWqX
What are you listening to this summer?
Autographed CD's are still available at www.howieday.com.  I signed 1,300 last week, just for you. You probably won't order 1,300 though.
AccuWeather says "RealFeel" in NYC hit 112 degrees today.  Embarking on a flick with ice cream.  It's all I can do.  Stay cool.  Stay cool.
Ceasefire EP has a nice little buzz!  If you like it, thanks in advance for turning your friends onto it or leaving a good review on iTunes!
I finished "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" by Tom Wolfe last night.  Made me want to hang a parachute in my living room.  What next?

I wake up everyday, with the same ol' nagging sense of a dream...
Has anyone else noticed how amazing Olive Garden commercials have gotten lately?
@laabswes Undressed is #9 on the new album... and Postcard From Mars is #10...
So, "Sound The Alarm" is already an album by 'Saves the Day'...  And there's a band that goes by "Sound The Alarm" from Bangor, PA... Weird?
On voice rest.  BOOOOO!  So... which of the 3 songs on the EP are your favorite?  How do you feel about "Everyone Loves to Love a Lie"?
@howiekday listening to be there on the radio in mn... awesome! (via @TylerBeauchamp) it's starting to happen!
What's TODAY when the Celts and the Lakers are gonna win TOMORROW?  I guess it's YESTERMORROW! Wow. That was so lame I might lose followers.
goodnight, all!
@randakaylee @HowieKDay Hey Howie! Love your music. What album is "No Longer What You Require" on? i cant find it on itunes...  NEW ALBUM!!!
Early gloom on the California coast today!  Relaxing with friends... and juggling...  In MY MIND...   ...  ...  Oops!
I love when it stays light out longer...  In Maine it stays light till 2am in June...(not really).  Yestermorrow seems to be gaining steam..
Possible album titles:  "R is for Rocket", "Yestermorrow" (Ray Bradbury kick), "Sound The Alarm" or "Hurry Up and Wait"...
Release date for the NEW HD ALBUM is AUGUST 25th!  (Yooz guys been askin')
I'm pretty bad at tennis, I'm only slightly athletic.  However, I can thank NOT making the highschool basketball team for my music career...
Off to play tennis.  Enjoying my last few days as a civilian before vocal surgery (nothing crazy, no worries!)
@musicfan24 RESET!!  YES!!!  Still backed up tho.  Garbage disposals are like pinky toes, you don't miss them until they get all messed up.
Just broke my garbage disposal.  I guess you're not supposed to put artichokes in there.  Damn it all to hell, more apples.
I take sequencing the record way too seriously
Off to a gallery opening...  I'm so freakin' ahhtsie!
Be There...  the song really illustrates one of my favorite quotes:  "Women are psychotic, men are jerks"...  But how do you SHOOT that?
Anybody have any amazing ideas for a "Be There" video?
Why do you suppose we have the words "foot" and "feet", but when it comes to "hand" there isn't a word like "HEEND"?  I'm gonna sleep on it.
Goodnight (or possibly, good morning) everyone!
Good afternoon!  Thanks for all the amazing feedback on the new EP!  Fun Fact:  The day that underwater shot was taken, it was 48 degrees.
Hey y'all!!!  There's only 2 reviews up on iTunes of the ep!  If you have time, write a good one!  (but don't say I told you to!!!)....
Look where I am!  Beautimous! http://yfrog.com/6udjdj
Hope you like the new stuff...  I'm off to lunch w/ my parents (they're visting)
"Be There" EP comes out today!!!  Listen here for free, then buy it on iTunes!... http://tinyurl.com/64kxuf/6
Managed to avoid the wheel of fortune at the Vegas airport!  I prefer the fortune cookies from my fav Thai restaurant anyway.
Getting on my private jet soon.  It just happens to have "American Airlines" printed on it.  And there's strangers we're letting come w/.
I quite like blueberries...  Delicious.  And full of antioxidants!  A hill made of them?  Could you ski on it?  What do the skis look like?
Good morning (uh, afternoon)...  Gonna go get my run on.  Gotta keep the cheeks at bay.  (That didn't come out right) ... (Neither did that)
Ahh, St. Louis.  Good to be back here.  I think you're going to like the new album...  I think I'm gonna have to start playing more piano!
Driving again...  Listening to the running order of the record to see if there are any last minute tweaks.
Goodnight everyone!  Off to St. Louis tomorrow...  Laitress on the Men-ge'!
Seeing I love you man for the 2nd time tonight!  Why have sno caps become less popular in the last decade?
Just came off stage in kc...  Power went out after first song...  So I did a full set by candlelight!!
@jleblancmusic ..3 songs coming out next month...  Be There, 40 Hours, and Counting On Me.  Full album out on cd, digital, and VINYL in Aug.
Just finished soundcheck.  We rented a highlander, but there's no sword in it.  WTF???
Should I tweet here on howiekday?  Or @howieday?
On a plane to KC!!!  First face mask sighting at DFW...  Breathe shallow, breathe shallow...
Just finished up the gig in Austin!  Now on our way to Kansas City for tomorrow...  Hopefully well catch coast to coast on the AM dial!
How much tweeting is too much tweeting?  If anybody knows where to get Grether's Pastilles....  I need.
I wish I could steal home...
@mattsneed  pretty much the same!  But I do admit, it's a little better.
At Stubb's.  Stubb is nowhere to be found.  He only comes out when it's sunny.  He's afraid of mice, the way velvet feels, and thunderstorms
Off to bed.  I get it a little more now.  It's like a whole new world, a whole new world for you and me.
Austin tomorrow... just came off stage in Dallas.  Austin tomorrow.  Sorry I'm twittering so much.  The band downstairs is loud.
@SaraOsburn glad you enjoyed the new stuff.... I don't get how this crap works.  Soon enough, I shall understand.
Although, right now, I feel quite anonymous.  Twittering to myself.
Maybe since I only have 3 followers so far, I'll let the audience in Dallas know to check me out on here...  That also would prove it's me?
still in Dallas... time to go see Nick open this rock concert!  Then I'm on.  Well, hopefully....
at the hotel in dallas...  show at HOB tonight!
