Moving words with heartwarming comedic breaks from all the speakers, but I boohooed pretty good during this speech... watching it with my son only amplified the waterworks.  #RIP41 https://t.co/R4oABgQWtq
Slick spots this morning in the Northeast... and tonight's precip will start as a mix, bringing a glaze to parts of northern #NY and #NewEngland tomorrow morning. https://t.co/vDbNt3NgIH
Surprising, encouraging statement from the mayor of #Anchorage:   “The extent of damage here is relatively small compared to the scale of the earthquake” (No fatalities)

On a more positive note... #hurricane season ends today. https://t.co/6LvwZXoPLW
#USGS predicts a 27% chance of  an aftershock of 6.0M or greater occurring in/near #Anchorage within the next week -- that is significant risk for additional damage.
There have been at least 18 aftershocks of ranging from  3-5.7M (the first) in #Anchorage
I just love the mission of #MakeAWish https://t.co/JIfZsnkJ1e
@Timben66 @Ginger_Zee We've pick our sides and we're stickin to it :)
@pdykstra @Ginger_Zee It's a diplomatic gesture to include NJ ;)
Severe storms developing after dark and continuing thru the overnight into tomorrow... snow to the NW and heavy rain in the NE quadrant of this storm thru most of the weekend. https://t.co/r7j6iibCbC
This is just the beginning... snow levels will lower as totals top 3+ FEET —  and the pattern is looking pretty active thru next week.  Great base building snow in the mountains setting up. https://t.co/UDgLqvman0

Another storm system targeting California tonight -- 60 mph winds, up to 25 foot waves on the coast and up to 3' of snow in the mountains... and heavy rain that could trigger mudslides in wildfire burn zones. https://t.co/6huVbolmOU

@Laurie_David @chucktodd @CNN @FoxNews as I tell my 7 year old daughter --&gt; you shouldn't take your frustration out on people who don't deserve it.  My job is to report, and add context/perspective when appropriate.  GW does amplify some extreme weather events... tornadoes (in the current research) is not included.
President Trump doesn't 'believe' report climate change hurts economy.  Here are 5 takeaways - ABC News https://t.co/gpVoqoDw8H
Beautiful water vapor loop of a nasty storm...  secondary low cranking up on the occlusion... cold, wet, windy in the megalopolis.  ICK factor is high. https://t.co/R5sVBB8f2V
@RnbwSprinkles I hear ya but money not the issue.  All that was needed was to see what the scientists were seeing...  show me what's on their computer screens, on the wall, or something.  They spend much more on fancy animations in between live events.  These are the important moments.
Now #Nasa... about your television production...  ehhh that was not so good.

#Mars #InSightLanding coverage begins in less than an hour... here's the link to watch:  https://t.co/STqLUTFbzJ
@Laurie_David Oh that... well that's actually true... still is... there is no consensus on how GW will alter tornadoes, which require many ingredients.  Weather is complicated, especially in the mesoscale.  You're not doing the cause any good spewing venom and bad facts.
Several storms will impact the west coast this week... needed rain, (but burn areas beware), and snows that will build a great base on the mountains. https://t.co/y3zTkhmfwF
@Laurie_David @chucktodd Not sure why or how you think I'm a climate change denier...  I've reported every IPCC report supporting their consensus... not to mention individual weather events that have a climate link signal.
Here's how the rest of our storm shakes out today...  heavy blowing snow north &amp; west of centter - heavy rain again for the I-95 corridor today/tonight.  There will be flooding issues along the NE coast as a secondary low develops. https://t.co/msAkI8XsaE

A solid 3-6" of snow across #NY #NJ #CT #PA with a few spots near 8"  -- list --&gt; https://t.co/nIRi8Trwjy
Officially 6" of snow in #CentralPark #NYC -- models showed the big snowfall rates... and obviously big enough to cool the urban island of #NYC and accumulate more than I expected... @NWS was right to upgrade their forecast before the snow hit.   Incredible I-95 November snow!
Easily 3" heavy wet snow on the #Manhattan #UWS ... here are some official totals and times recorded https://t.co/nIRi8Trwjy
#NYC is an absolute mess after getting thumped by 3 hours of heavy snow on untreated streets... #gridlock
Snow goes to rain by midnight along I-95 but this will be a very slick and stormy commute... especially for the interior.  Windy overnight as coastal low approaches NY Harbor around daybreak.  Hello mid November. https://t.co/wJ0qWpYKOe
Snow forecasts from @NWS have been bumped up for #NJ #NY #CT (perhaps a bit too much), but there's no question a ~5hrs burst of heavy wet snow is coming, starting um soon! https://t.co/tVbzWvkGfi

6 more bodies found in Paradise #CA #Campfire bringing fatality total to 48 — beyond heart wrenching — 8,817 structures destroyed.  The worst fire in #California history keeps getting worse.
#WoolseyFire over 96K acres burned but now 35% contained.  They’ve got a  pretty good handle on that one, with very little fire activity below the high hills.
Today's eastern storm makes way for a more substantial nor'easter Thursday, including a more wintery mix of precip. https://t.co/HYUuvtrMV0
It's a mess in the East this morning.  Rainy, windy, cold, with snow trailing this expansive system.  Super cold in #Texas with snow flakes flying in unusual spots for November! https://t.co/2YObj8a5ov
No rainfall expected for #California for another 7 days, but models hinting at a pattern change that could bring some moisture in next week.  But that's next week... https://t.co/GEC9ZOeave
Winds have already gusted to 86 mph in the hills east of #SanDiego.  Fire weather conditions there are Extremely Critical today.  Any fire starts will have explosive growth. https://t.co/AboCV3eNKd
The last time #SoCal saw such a strong, persistent #SantaAna event was October 2007 which was also nothing short of disastrous.  I’m worried for the #SanDiego area next 36 hours.
Red Flag Warnings have been extended into Wednesday with the strongest winds of this entire event expected tomorrow.  #Riverside to #SanDiego County in the extreme fire weather conditions.

Fire does not discriminate.  Rich or poor, fire destroys without compromise.  Highlighting celebrities impacted by the #CaliforniaWildfires underlines that fact.  That said, it's been our lowest priority angle on this story. https://t.co/BK41aWQykZ

I need to hear from any animal rescue org that’s in the storm zone.  This little buggers need food &amp; shelter ASAP.  Please help @ASPCA #HurricaneMichael #PanamaCity https://t.co/V7l9yCp4n1

Getting around for our first look at some of the damage.  Didn’t take long for us to come across this church/school torn up pretty bad.  #DestinyWorshipCenter #PCB https://t.co/XqXddqmVHG
Winds are rippin as the eye wall of #HurricaneMichael approaches.  Turning more offshore now which helps surge issues.
UPDATE:  #HurricaneMichael winds strengthening to 150 mph as pressure drops to 923mb.  The center of the storm now just 50 miles out!
#HurricaneMichael has made the turn to the NE... barring a wobble left, landfall of #HurricaneMichael center likely between #PanamaCity and #PortStJoe #Florida https://t.co/zgqVOW5l5g
The blue spots shown here within the eye of #HurricaneMichael are “non-precipitation” objects  =&gt;  BIRDS likely that got caught up in the storm. https://t.co/Qdj5GdI1iw
Lightning and multiple vortices spinning around the eye of #HurricaneMichael 😳 https://t.co/vm9h2anJoL
At 933mb #HurricaneMichael now stronger than #Harvey (h/t @manzo) and showing no signs of weakening.  Structure of the current storm is textbook.  We need an eye-wall replacement before landfall for any hope of a hiccup. https://t.co/eHbW3pEKyA
You have perhaps another hour to get shelter safely in the #HurricaneMichael storm zone. https://t.co/4aSO4BErNQ
@Washeeta @BradNitzWSB I thought the same thing... not this time
@TERRIJBAUMANN @spann Yes.  The sky is for all to enjoy 😊

Tropical Storm #Michael rapidly intensifying... nearing #hurricane strength... could become a CAT 3 before landfall. https://t.co/XmwDeU2vIh
#HurricaneSergio and its massive eye 100 miles across...  will be weakening as it heads toward the cooler waters but will bring #SoCal beaches big surf and some flooding this week. https://t.co/hG7aU0Fyk4
#Michael will be another right-side heavy storm coupled with a strong Atlantic High that will result in high wind/rain/water impacts on the east coasts of #Florida Georgia #SouthCarolina https://t.co/SgVbpj2vI3
Hurricane Hunters reported back from #Michael show a strengthening system.  NHC upgrading the forecast at landfall to a CAT 2 storm somewhere in NW #Florida Wednesday. https://t.co/uK2nsZ89qp

The new forecasted slower approach of #Florence is bad in that the coast will get lashed for longer, but good in that the land interaction, upwelling, and shear should weaken it below Cat 4.  We’ll see... timing is in flux as is where it meanders post landfall. https://t.co/cQ3KxVxRWY

#Hurricane Watches are up.  Landfall timing has slowed a touch w/ forecast track changing very little (+/- 50 miles).  Hurricane wind field will be about 100 miles wide on approach so that line is merely a reference point. Storm stall post landfall is another issue. https://t.co/x0g5jIzNI5

#Lane now 150 miles SW of #Honolulu finally moving west at 7 mph w/ 50 mph max sustained winds.  #TropicalStorm Warnings have been dropped but Flash Flood Watches remain up for all of #Hawaii https://t.co/MsIwAWgm6z
Whelp, that happened quickly... shear finally putting the strangle hold on #Lane... now a #Tropical #Storm
Thankfully the lava flow has slowed considerably and is not a factor, but there have been events where volcanic eruptions and tropical cyclones have made for a nasty precip mix. https://t.co/h44JCo1BSf
Category 2 #Hurricane #Lane now just 150 miles from #Honolulu.  More details and a live report from #Hawaii @ABCWorldNews https://t.co/fQeDKiIPoy
On our NW approach to landing at #HNL you can see the outflow "grain" in the clouds amplified by upper low helping tug #Lane north... that is, if you stand on your head because I guess I held my phone upside down. https://t.co/IC0iIx8Z8O
@JrLaslett @Ginger_Zee @Racing31881 often speculated but never scientifically proven
#HurricaneLane now 180 miles south of #Honolulu moving north at 5 mph with max winds of 110 mph — CAT 2 — forecast track nudged right but a turn left is likely IF #Lane weakens more... https://t.co/6pHX1JQL7n
A brush fire on #Maui fanned by wind gusts to 50 mph has forced  evacuations of people in shelters for #HurricaneLane.
#Hurricane #Lane now a Cat 4 — will weaken as it makes a southern route toward #Hawaii but #Oahu now well within the forecast margin of error Friday. https://t.co/DJ5NSwg99M

#CarrFire Update: 1378 structures destroyed including 965 homes, making it the 6th most destructive fire in #California history.  112,888 acres burned - 30% contained
The #CarrFire is now the 7th most destructive fire in #CA history, surpassing last year’s #ThomasFire.  Over 103K acres burned, destroying over 1100 structures (818 homes).
A little pacific push mid-week will cool temps in the #California fire zone 4-5 degrees.  It’s not much, but anything will help. https://t.co/YOeUHTnTU1

Not gonna lie, this was outstanding.   #buythestock #breakfastofchampions https://t.co/DeneNHKHnp
Heat stretching into the Northwest today...  only hope of not hitting 105 in Redding is a thicker smoke layer, but that limits the fire fighting attack from the air. #carrfire #pickyourpoison https://t.co/WWBaN9Z9qY
Back from the fire zone in studio for @GMA  —  a bit beaten and smokey but here we go.
@kim_carreiro Thanks Kim :)
#CarrFire Update: 89K acres burned  Containment remains unchanged at 5%
#CarrFire Weather Briefing:   Smoke has been holding down temps to ~100F, “but if you can see your shadow that means fuel is pre-heating”... and will burn more aggressively.  Check out the Incident Met working the map: https://t.co/XaVg34RFUs
We’re live again in #Redding #CA — grim discovery yesterday of a woman and 2 children who perished in the #CarrFire — all of this is just heart wrenching. https://t.co/wcKimaNkmG

@QCGreg @GMA @qctimes @danbharris @paulafaris @quantumphil1 nice work GON!!
That said... “Arbuckle Winds” from the south are scheduled to pickup around 1pm PDT — seeing lots of crew movement now
Smoke from the #CarrFire actually helped yesterday (and hopefully today).  It blocks the sun, which keeps temps 5-10F cooler, which keeps the evening winds down🤞 https://t.co/VJywf1NFTz
#CarrFire now over 80,000 acres, additional evacuations, but it was a more successful night with structure protection and less intense wind/fire conditions.
We’re in #Redding #CA where the #CarrFire has destroyed 500 homes and business... including homes of some firefighters... 2 of which died in the fire... just heartbreaking. https://t.co/BwefudADk3

@MissAshes92 There is that, but I assume the alerts go out just for the warned polygon and not the entire county, which helps.

Good morning... here's the latest #Alberto info...  '"landfall" may not happen until late Monday or Tuesday, but rain is already reaching into south #Florida. https://t.co/c6o8J1wx7l
#Alberto has been an eager beaver this millennium...  also May storm in 2012 and an early June storm in 2006... and one of the longest-lived TCs in 2000.  Perhaps ole Berto should be retired for his unwarranted enthusiasm.

A tropical (or hybrid) depression is likely to form and impact the Gulf Coast states this weekend.  NHC now has an 80% chance of development. https://t.co/eViWl8nPzB

@JimCantore @capitalweather ditto in the NYC area where ABC and most of local TV forecasts I saw were far lower than the 12-18” from NWS
The heaviest plume of rain has thankfully been just north (and south) of #Ventura and #SantaBarbara burn areas.  So far the ground has been able to take the more sporadic downpours.  #SLO and #PasoRobles getting the worst of it. https://t.co/bVgRzwGmke
I remember spring snowstorms as a kid, racing to get out to play in the snow before it melted.  Hope you got yours today, that late March sun is strong.
@DLWad1 hm. I've lived out there and always heard them shortened to Sierras as whole range and Sierra as a location.  But I suppose you are correct, so I'll try to change that.
@DesireeCausey I’m almost certain most food truck owners do not have an MBA.  That is a statement of admiration, not judgment or sexism.

Nor'easter reboot not quite as strong as last week's but hugs the coast and has more cold air to work with = more widespread snow.  Windier and wetter near the coast. Rough track and timing here https://t.co/rmqHxeo14K
Our Wednesday storm is shaping up to be a more classic nor’easter. Models getting along with a more textbook track.  Wetter and windier near the coast with big snow inland, especially at elevation.
Though these forecast headlines come from our @ABC station in #Philly, the overall theme holds for most Northeast locations. https://t.co/HrH0gQYGPV

Here we go... epic coastal storm unfolding... we’re at 987mb... need 979mb by 7am or more realistically 975mb by 1pm to be a ‘bomb’... just semantics at this point cause it’s gonna be ugly with this track.
Though airlines are waiving change fees ahead of storm, because it is more of a wind than snow wet at airports, ops decisions to cancel flights have not made as yet.

Gonna be a huge, long duration, wind field.  High Wind Watches now extend all the way into #Georgia.  Winter Storm Watches may need to reach more south and east too.
Cool to see the Euro and GFS begin to negotiate a compromise, which only brings more confidence to a high impact, in like a lion March 1-2 storm...  #roar
More weather goodies going into orbit tomorrow!  Goes west young satellite, goes west...  #GOES17 https://t.co/YJpIZbXZzV
Precip next 3 days shows bulk of flooding rain in the Mid-South Today/Thu, the Northeast mess Friday, and the biggest California storm of the year Thu-Sat. Over 5 FEET of snow coming for the Sierras. https://t.co/jvXdcc9qY8
@BradFieldWx @DavidMuir BRAD!!!  you are the grand master, and I will forever be your humble apprentice 😊
Coastal Flood and Winter Storm Watches now up for the impending Northeast storm Friday.  The inland snow details are loose, but the coastal impacts forecast is firm.  Big waves, wind, and 3 high tide cycles for flooding.
Good to see some red in the #Sierra.  Not good to see it across #AR #TN #MS #OH flood zone.  Rain/Snow next 5 days. https://t.co/jtTSIcffEF
Good Morning West Coast!  #SoCal storm exits today with a couple more to spread needed precip into the #Sierra thru the week.  Winter Storm Watches now up. https://t.co/0WF9shidzA

Here's how the start of the next batch of rain times out (noon to midnight).  Beauty of a day for the East Coast. https://t.co/dVt6oQ50YM
About 10 more hours of dry weather before the next surges of rain reach the flood zone.  Plus we’ll update the NE storm potential and finally some winter in California @GMA https://t.co/rKWycy3O5P
The word from #Rome is visitors and locals alike loved the rare snow ⛄️ https://t.co/k6hohjI9MR
And for the #California, and nice SE trajectory of storms will bring some rain and much needed #Sierra snow. https://t.co/QSnPArrwb0
All signs point to a potent northeast coastal storm Friday.  Low location and exit timing will determine impact and duration.  Coastal flooding, rain, and wind a good bet for starters. https://t.co/u1rVKCzPvC

Our 12 hour snowstorm performed to the high range of forecast ❄️❄️❄️  NE Snowfall Recap via @danpeckwx https://t.co/LRtUImhDn3
Temps barely cold enough for snow along i-95, but overnight timing helps make it stick and accum. It’s a 12 hour event, but the low could get frisky when it hits the Atlantic. https://t.co/Dza6pVgYSe
Temps hugging 32F and a quick moving system should limit totals along I-95 but 3-6" just inland a good bet.   Sat 6pm - Sun 6am animation here: https://t.co/Z8onP1btO4

BTW the coldest #Superbowl ever played outdoors was 39F in 1972 in #NewOrleans!
Here's how our eastern storm shakes out today.  Needed rain in the SE but some icing NW of I-85 thru the #Carolinas.  1-4" #MI #PA #NY. Snow quickly to rain I-95.  Plan your travel accordingly, or just watch the game at home, after you watch @ABCWorldNews of course! https://t.co/vIufLkFfaK
This will easily be the coldest #Superbowl at game time (outside).  Beating the old record of 26F set back in 1992 also played in #Minneapolis.
The over/under is 48.  I'll take the under.  Forecast temp at game time ~4F.  I might take the under there too.
Happy #SuperbowlSunday!  The money favorite will win today, as it does nearly every year.  I'm just hoping for a good game.

Why is the #PuertoRico situation so dire now, and in the months ahead?  Thorough write-up here: https://t.co/DdOUUWNJ1n
~18 day supply of food in #PuertoRico.  Ports opening will get more, but lack of truck drivers is a big distribution issue right now.
5% of #PuertoRico now has power and there is currently ~20 days of gasoline on the island, per Governor Rosselló h/t @EvaPilgrim
@RealCMFallick @Isabel1170 yes I'm sure.
@agape217 understood.  will have team on ground push.  be patient... big island with big needs everywhere

Certainly plays a part. So far no Rita-like highway catastrophies that I've heard. https://t.co/3EoMC9qRyI
@randallkjones Looks like Naples is gonna get creamed.  Send me updates and stay safe RKJ!
Yes, though the size and scope of #Irma and track approach yield no 'good side' or safe haven in #Florida https://t.co/LQfXE9pqIh
Operational GFS and Euro holding west, if not more... https://t.co/ZlxPSwISvo
@steffanwatkins @CNN_Oppmann Oppmann is the mann!
#GOBIGRED https://t.co/xGdknG3pgA
My #Turks buddy made it through the storm and says @GraceBayClub is a mess but held up well.  He's unsure of other parts of the island. https://t.co/gXTjdI8D7R
#Irma 11a Update: another nudge left but fcst to be 140-150mph at landfall w/ growing wind field = no real safe spot. https://t.co/LgZepllKjL
Huge EYE DIAMETER  ---&gt; 40 NM! MAX SUSTAINED WINDS 130 KT WITH GUSTS TO 160 KT. 64 KT....... 60NE  45SE  35SW  55NW.
And being a peninsula, there are only 2 interstate routes north out of this state. 75 &amp; 95 are jammed and extremely slow going. #irma
I have never seen a storm evacuation this large and thorough.  Hotels, shops, restaurants, etc... all shuttering or in that process. #irma
Good Morning from #Miami https://t.co/lhywp0sFaZ
And this, at least 5 dead as 8.1M  #earthquake rocks southern Mexico, felt in capital and a tsunami on the coast. https://t.co/UYtqk82GU3
Good Morning.  #Irma now just under Category 5 strength.  Here's the latest track.  A very slight shift west on #Florida approach. https://t.co/I4CF74xNpU
Just now from #Turks hotelier:  "One of my staff just called me wanting a rescue. Roof gone and 6 family hiding in a bedroom. Jesus"
Not much change to 11pm NHC forecast into #Florida - more westward bend well after landfall into #GA/#AL then remnants into #TN https://t.co/yQrmyxPzaN
Phones are blasting across #Miami -- #Hurricane Warning is now up for nearly all of South #Florida
#Irma eye now ~20 miles wide and max winds 165 mph.  Hopefully, this weakening trend continues, it's still a CAT 5
He says the structure is "barely holding up" ... "we are getting totally hammered. It's awful."  #TurksandCaicos #Irma
The @GraceBayClub is top level w/ extreme hurricane building codes.  I assure you the owner/operator doesn't scare easily.  I feel his fear.
This text from my friend who operates hotel on #Turks:  "What is the latest?  Don't know if we can take much any longer. It's brutal"
This morning @GMA we talked #Homestead recovery.  Just seeing this stunning #Andrew (small) vs #Irma comparison ( h/t @PaulRogersSJMN) https://t.co/CFQbRNMbj5
#PLS could use this more southern approach. 65mph gusting to 81 now. Bout to get really bad. https://t.co/uT6AcijVOb https://t.co/GlfAUADyRV
While we're getting closer to the NHC locking in on a forecast, but we're not there yet. That said, best case is not a good case for anyone.
The anxiety level has jumped even higher here in South Florida since 5pm.  Our hotel just called to order us out by night fall.  #Irma
Nearly the entire states of #Florida #Georgia, and #SC are in the forecast cone. https://t.co/mBMcZFMEKW
And there it is, a shift of the #Irma track west.  Sustained winds continue at an astounding 175 mph with few speed bumps in front. https://t.co/OUGL2KjI75
#PLS reporting sustained 48 mph gusting to 60 mph with #Irma on final approach ~80 miles SE.  Conditions there will go down hill in the dark
Guidance models shifted west again... eesh I don't envy NHC forecasters. 50 miles in either direction can alter impacts exponentially
@hotcookinmama2 @NickGregoryFox5 yes likely, but the winds were definitely calm in that 30-40 minute time period as barometer bottoms out
@FPOnTheDL none of us do :)
Oh, and there's #Katia and #Jose to make THREE hurricanes on-going.  The later to hit islands just devastated by #Irma. https://t.co/pg6mTRDSPX
NHC forecast track with a slight nudge east.  Hurricane Watches now up for south #Florida and a 90% chance of tropical storm winds Sunday. https://t.co/sbkZJXL2DX
55 mph winds sustained ramping up to 155 mph gusts in just 1 hour, then completely calm. Incredible!  (h/t @NickGregoryFox5) https://t.co/djQwJtmdIG
Building codes are strong for the resorts in #TurksandCaicos but I fear for the lesser built homes especially for surge on SE side tonight.
Good Morning #Homestead / #FloridaCity - an area wiped out 25 years ago by Cat 5 Hurricane Andrew https://t.co/utzpGwWQzv
#Irma 90 miles N of #PuntaCana DR w/180mph winds.  The eye is a little ragged now, but on track to hit #Turks hard tonight &amp; #Florida Sunday https://t.co/kK6TxolIxx

@carlquintanilla @pbaratelli unless there are evac orders I'd rather sit at home than in traffic. NE FL could be a relatively safe pocket.
@FPOnTheDL seems to be legit but haven't looked closely
@carlquintanilla @pbaratelli an early turn is great news for #Florida, not so much for #Georgia and #Carolinas. Lots of uncertainty still
@sangita_patel @etnow @ETCanada fun work in Toronto :) hope you're well!

Incredible.  You can see the meso vortices rotating within the eye wall.  Remarkable, mesmerizing, and terrifyingly powerful. https://t.co/hnqb59Of13
#Irma an even stronger Cat 5 w/ 180mph winds and an expanding #hurricane wind field over 100 miles across.  There is no silver lining now. https://t.co/pbo0ILl6Dj
#Irma now a frightening 175 mph Category 5 hurricane - the only silver lining right now is hurricane wind field is small at 70 miles across. https://t.co/o3PJtuvktL
We'll see what the 00Z does, but the GFS ensemble has #Florida surrounded with #Irma options, and none are good for the U.S. at the moment https://t.co/BGAcq2bNwq

@jvrmrc1967 the chances are good. Perhaps Better than 50%
Longer range models bring #Irma in for a U.S. strike late next weekend.  Everyone on the East Coast should have a hurricane plan in place.
Growing confidence in #Irma impacting northern #Caribbean, #Turks, &amp; #Bahamas.  And this trajectory is not good for the U.S. https://t.co/hUQGvyc13P
