On a marketplace 15-30%+ take sounds sustainable. @Patreon seems too low (and they’ve admitted that).

@MLifschitz32 @singareddynm @axios @theskimm @inside @stratechery @dailycandy Who else is doing newsletter businesses @awwstn? @danprimack?
@MLifschitz32 @singareddynm The top newsletter companies can make millions to tens of millions each    @axios makes 8 figures @theskimm  makes mid seven figures (I’ve heard)  @inside just broke $1m a year @stratechery makes millions in subs  Back in the day @dailycandy made mid 8 figures   It’s 1st inning
@Patfactorx In a sub $10m fund, called a micro fund, they typically get a couple of million to invest but they get no management fee to pay salaries.   In a traditional fund they get 2% of the fund size a year to pay salaries &amp; overhead.   So a $20m fund would have $400k a year to spend.

@KingDogDad It’s a killer gig if you write about a topic you love! It’s a “meh” gig if you don’t love the topic and have already immersed yourself in it.   Ie: We want to hire someone for https://t.co/Hs8PmzQkYq that has experience in sales and who loves the topic already.
@_gordee A full time writer would be able to do 2-3 newsletters a day, depending on their skill level... so it might net out to 40-60k a year if we hired full time writers (we don’t do that).   We want well rounded freelancers  with other things going on... but who want an anchor client.
@_gordee If you are passionate about a topic, say video games, &amp; you listen to video game podcasts, read video game news &amp; play games already, my guess is it will take 3-5 hours to write a daily newsletter based on your skill as a writer.  Sign up for https://t.co/lPdRLwwSZy for example

Should you invest in founders working on two projects?  Bottom line: startups are absurdly hard. Running two at the same time is like winning two chess matches at once.

When people in the Valley call a startup a lifestyle business, they are implying that it’s a GREAT lifestyle, perhaps with a certainty of pulling out a million or 2 in profits a year, as opposed to the 5-10% chance of waiting a decade to have a greater.. https://t.co/UQ3dw6xRyd

@FoldableHuman @JayLeonard @Patreon It was not proven enough to find an alternative funding source (bank), &amp; it certainly wasn’t easy to scale off modest cash flow.   If it could be bootstrapped it would have been, I know since I’ve heard no less than 20 pitches for a “better Patreon.”  It’s a challenged model.

@tarikh @matt_slotnick @jhong @Quan @fox there are some notable boot strapped businesses that have hit serious scale without venture funding, like @mailchimp and @DistroKid --- but these are very rare and require having technical founders will to work for free/below market, and no funded competition.

Most VCs don’t look at a lifestyle business as bad, they look at it as bad for getting an outsized return for LPs.

@JaneFra17391331 @Patreon Please make a Google sheet with your model of deploying $100m into 20 or 30 slow growth companies and let's see what you come up with!
@eddiemac3356 @fox Most of them are profitable, breakeven or could be profitable with 10% cost cuts. Go long  capital is driving everyone to go global, but it's not dotcom madness this time around. These companies have real revenue and large numbers of delighted customers (see Uber, Airbnb, etc).
@JaneFra17391331 @Patreon What is terf mass flagging, you delightful ray of sunshine?

@therealrainfall @fox Unicorn label by @aileenlee is critical concept here — ultra rare, invaluable.
@adamamcbride @fox If you own an agency or consultancy that bills $3-10m a year with a 20% margin, that’s the perfect example. Make 6-20m over a decade... pay your taxes and you’re a millionaire!
but banks don’t give small business loans, &amp; certainly not to high risk new ideas like @Patreon. If they did they would need to factor in 90% of loans going to zero, which means the winners would need to pay back 20x to produce a return—which is what  VCs do! High risk capital! https://t.co/yySrm7gIkr
@clearJB @fox Bootstrapping simply means without the assistance of investment capital — the origin is from the colloquialism “to pull one up by their bootstraps.” Doesn’t mean you don’t have customers or a killer product.   In Silicon Valley the most coveted founders are bootstrappers.
This is a misconception @Fox.   When Silicon Valley calls something a lifestyle business they imply a GREAT lifestyle for the founder(s), &amp; that the founder(s) are best served by making $1-2m a year in profits—sometimes for decades—rather than going for a unicorn return. https://t.co/r98TMdSXGW
@KateKendall @bigyahu @mattallen @shl @fox That’s the best model: bootstrap and skip one or two rounds of funding, going big and preserving the founders (and investors) stake on the cap table.

@neildugal On the margins
Take a moment to look at your product today and ask “if this went away what would my customers do?” In most cases, the answer is “nothing,” because your product isn’t essential or extraordinary. So, get back to work making that product MUCH better.
#1 reason: founders build products that don’t provide extraodriary value. They might provide some value or a lot—but not extraordinary value.  Often founders don’t realize this, but mostly they dilude themselves  into thinking their product is extraordinary when it’s ordinary.
Founders: Startups are a extremely simple formula: make a great product that people get amazing value from, charge them a fair price and then pump all the profits back into your flywheel (team, product &amp; brand).   So why do so many fail?

Taking VC money is a choice, everyone knows exactly what it means and the people complaining about the toxicity are being disingenuous... no one has a gun to founders heads saying “you have to take VC!!!!”   Build slow, build fast or pick a pace in the middle — founder’s decide.
Founders: hyperbolic nonsense from @Bryce below. if a great VC wants to give you $5-20m for 20% of your business 1-2x, &amp; help you build a unicorn that’s OK.

@eddiemac3356 @netflix Model 350M subs and the spend staying the same —- where do we wind up?
@ataussig @eringriffith I’m told this is exactly @a16z model: they only hire former founders who have had giant exits. They don’t take salaries &amp; put all that money salaries of the services folks who provide free consulting to founders.   Was supposed to disrupt the VC industry, don’t think it has.
@richkleiman @TheKnicksWall Stoked. Let me know when we‘re taping!
@CognitoLOP @KapilGuptaMD Lock it up
@eddiemac3356 @netflix Model this out with 250M subscriptions —- then double that —- because @netflix is going to hit 250-500M global subs.
Back in 2011 I told y’all that @Netflix would become a studio — we got receipt! 🧾 🔥 🎙 https://t.co/Ao3KZEDOVL

@dylanized @Microsoft @SlackHQ Like the didn’t do with YouTube and android?
.@hansois (@Nurxapp) on home delivery birth control, HIV prevention, HPV test + "Guess Fake Startup" https://t.co/N9M8mHqMiM
Very dangerous for @Microsoft to not buy @SlackHQ, which could very rapidly bundle an office Suite into their lock on “company chat.”  Google could make SlackHQ free with Google Docs and connect it to the GMAIL social graph and allow a billion folks to participate in SlackOsphere
It’s a no brainer for @sundarpichai or @satyanadella to buy @SlackHQ right now... but the inspired choice would be for @JeffBezos to buy it and create an App/Office365/google docs lawyer at @awscloud   That would be yum yum for @Amazon!

@jhong @naval @paulg @Chritchen @avc @TWistartups @saastr @AngelList @ycombinator Interesting. One reasons why a founder wouldn't take money from the same VC again is because they are able to fund themselves to Series A/B &amp; then create a marketplace.   IME many founders look back &amp; rightfully (or wrongfully) say "I could have done this with anyone's money!"

Most conflicts I see are a subset of all startup conflicts: the #problems co-founders can’t resolve and they bring to a trusted 3rd party, in this case, an investor.  more: https://t.co/0KHDt5lFDB
Before we talk about the conflict at hand, we need to look at the founders themselves and ask...  👉 are these emotionally mature founders who are self-aware?
Resolving co-founder conflicts 🥊 —&gt; https://t.co/0KHDt5lFDB   This is one of the hardest questions for me to answer because conflicts are so situational, often personal and if they are hard to resolve they are often complex with multiple resolution paths.

Sure, some of these bonds and index funds are backing interesting projects, but the truth is, this capital doesn’t change the world in the way startups do. I’m trying to inspire 10,000 rich people to become angels moving a small % of their zombie capital into startups.
Rich people are sitting on large hoards of zombie capital, be it bonds, index funds or cash, that sit passively in the cloud, allowing the rich to stay rich, beating inflation and sometimes a bit better.
If 10,000 individuals worth $10m each put 5% of their net worth — $500,000 — into angel investing over the next five years, that’s a billion dollars into seed stage startups. https://t.co/YN3fLavj0B

Note: No idea what’s true or false in this story, but if you control your company’s board with super voting you lose the oversight function — which is bad optics.   bad optics, bad governance &amp; a conflicted transaction certainly looks very bad.   GOVERNANCE MATTERS!
Bottom line: avoid any self dealing at your company, it’s simply not worth the headache. When you have to explain what you did, the mob assumes your guilty.

@MontreaLauren @TWistartups @memberful @Patreon got it.... so, they cost the same, but you white label and Pateron doesn't. also, they do customer support and you don't. not sure it matters for us... only thing i really need is the individual RSS feed so my top listeners can subscribe with their own RSS feed without ads.
@shash__wat @TWistartups @memberful @Patreon just listen to the ad-supported version!

@DonMacAskill @DerekjAndersen @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk @Cargill @MarsGlobal @Enterprise @SASsoftware @Mailchimp If you’re counting 100 year old companies, before VC even existed that’s cool... but I’m guessing they would have taken it in this era.

@insideNiMA @rmchase @indievc @alexdunsdon @vkhosla It’s a bit of a false premise, because the range of multiple offers would not be 2x.   A great VC would probably match or come within 10-20%, in which case you take the great VC!   If it’s $3m vs 1.5m for 20% I take the $3m — unless it’s top 5 firm.
@josephflaherty @indievc @web @peterpham @DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @LighterCapital @travisk i've been saying since the start, nothing wrong with bootstrapping... and i made this point in my book, https://t.co/aMsoEHSPER --- even saying bootstrappers were my favorite founders.  my point has always been that the industrial venture complex is amazing--have both!

@web @peterpham @DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk we will see outliers like Mailchimp for sure... and that's AWESOME. I'm not against it.  I just think it will be &lt; 1% of unicorns. it's way too hard.    I'm interested to see if any can achieve decacorn status (I think Mailchimp will).
@indievc @kplikethebird @DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @LighterCapital @travisk Well, I am the #1 syndicate in history... which makes me the 3rd most successful person at actually creating something between bootstrapping and VC--right after YC and AngelList (which are #1 and #2 right now).
@alexterenda Zoho is a good pull.... they started in the 90s in India, before their even was a VC presence there right? I'm guessing if founded in the past 10 years they would have taken it.   Mailchimp &amp; Minecraft are best examples... mailchimp will be decacorn I trhink.
@CarolForden @MJB_SF @andrewthoesen three of my four management team members are women.... so you're right, I have no idea.  🤣
@MarisaKabas ahh... so, your opinion is based on not understanding the economics. Noted!
@mattiecamp @singareddynm @rrhoover BREAKING NEWS: not everyone can take the same risk! AKA a democratic, capitalistic society.   if someone wants a totally level playing field, with little variability, I think communism provided that, albeit briefly, unsuccessfully and without personal freedoms
@guyfriedman @rabois that's good company to be in, I'll take it!
@kplikethebird @DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk it's obviously not.   The discussion you slid into is about should founders raise a ton of money and dilute themselves down to 10-20% ownership, vs. bootstrapping and not taking VC.   of course job &amp; product creation count!
@MarisaKabas some details on the side hustle/part-time gig that was offered (not by me) https://t.co/LquqUAQfpL   important to note: back end comp is what folks opt into here most of the time.
@JeanCHoffman @jacobhartog @nmsanchez @singareddynm @rrhoover people are entitled to their opinions, and I get that the system isn't fair... but i like to assume good will on the part of all parties and address the topic at hand as objectively as possible. if you read my post, it's obvious: take carry.
@MJB_SF https://t.co/ADKx1STSKO
@peterpham @DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk I'm excited to see the outcomes of these new VC firms that don't want a chance at an outlier result by backing founders who don't want them to have a monster win.   Please check back with me in 2029 Derek!

@DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk you're right... 10% of $830m is only $83M.... and $50m after taxes.   how will this founder ever survive this horrible existence!??!  (and maybe he took down $5-10m in secondary already!).

@kplikethebird @DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk have you used @Airtable?!?! it is MASSIVELY valuable to millions of people.... as proven by them paying $20m a year to use it.   had the founder on @TWistartups -- it's an awesome product https://t.co/BAp8gmYy4W
@jacobhartog @nmsanchez @singareddynm @rrhoover read this https://t.co/LquqUAQfpL   in this case, the 20 hour a week side hustle as a VC CoS, it would be economically foolish IMO to not take the backend over the cash comp.
@ninavizz @CarolForden @MJB_SF 1000% agree injustice exists. 1000% agree that the pay gap exists   1000% *disagree* that taking a 20 hour a week side hustle to break into VC is a bad idea... in fact, I would say it is economic foolishness to not take the backend comp. more: https://t.co/LquqUAQfpL
You played yourself Derek!   The founder of @Airtable is worth $100M and counting and this is a bad outcome??!?!   Ha! ha! Please #Jesus, let every founder in my portfolio have this disastrous outcome of $20m in revenue, unlimited cash reserves &amp; a bright future! https://t.co/yUKbASaJAl
@DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk You just played yourself Derek.... the founder of Airtable is worth $100M and counting and this is a bad outcome?!?!
@LukeThompson360 @singareddynm @rrhoover I wrote up the discussion here, with some basic math around why you should take the backend comp not the quick upfront comp https://t.co/LquqUAQfpL

@MJB_SF @andrewthoesen @CarolForden honest question: what's a better career path than the venture industrial complex/Silicon Valley journey? It ain't perfect, but I can't think of a better rout for young folks.
So Silicon Valley needs to create jobs that pay massively well, reduce risk &amp; give massive backend upside?!?   Done! 🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/hRzINkFdHu https://t.co/Mwr5jdCfct
@nmsanchez @singareddynm @rrhoover So Silicon Valley needs to create jobs that pay massively well, reduce risk and give massive backend upside?   Done!   https://t.co/hRzINkFdHu
@andrewthoesen @MJB_SF @CarolForden Everyone should NOT do a startup or be an angel/VC, just the folks that want a chance at creating massive wealth &amp; changing the world.   There are other platforms that change the world &amp; create massive wealth, I'm just not sure any do it as well as the venture industrial complex.
@OneBandwagonFan @MJB_SF Just wrote 1,000 words explaining why you should take this job &amp; backend comp -- not cash comp -- if you can figure out how to do this. This advice is only for folks who want to change their station in life, however. https://t.co/2xzTvUSMH4 in an hour or so. Waiting on an editor!
@MJB_SF coming up... on https://t.co/2xzTvUSMH4   [ 20-30% carry is what most micro VCs would get, I suspect they would give 20% of that 20-30% to their partner who didn't have to raise the fund. That would be 4-6% carry on profits ]
@CarolForden @MJB_SF I will write a longer blog post explaining just how bad your advice to young people looking to break out in VC is Melinda. Will be on https://t.co/2xzTvUSMH4 this afternoon. 🤣🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄 Happy Sunday!
@nmsanchez @singareddynm @rrhoover My understanding of capitalism, is that people get to make their *own* decisions of how much risk they want to take, dialing up &amp; down immediate comp against a risky backend.  Now, if you can sell or write code you can have both by working at Google, FB, etc!
@nmsanchez @singareddynm @rrhoover You are 1,000% correct in your assessment: jobs w/ (1) massive cash comp, (2) massive backend &amp; (3) no risk will result in a) the greatest number of people being able to take them and b) wealth creation.   However, I haven't seen any jobs that have 1, 2 and 3 -- have you?
@MJB_SF Do this for 20 hours a week (1,040 hours total) &amp; you get:  1/a huge network 2/carry in the fund (possibly big $) 3/a resume builder that makes you a VC (hardest job in the world to get)  Compare it to spending $30k a year on college or 4 hours a day watching TV--not a job.
@MJB_SF The point here is that the compensation is equity-based &amp; backload for the VC (@rrhoover ) and their #2. This is how small funds have always worked (they don't have fees). Most folks don't know this.  That being said, a modest stipend + backend comp would be better
@alexterenda 1/Please send me the list of bootstrapped unicorns... no one seems to have this list available.   2/"You may not even need one monster exit to have strong returns over a 10 year timeframe" -- make a google sheet &amp; share it, as I can't figure out how a loan outperforms equity!
@DerekjAndersen @bearmace @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk I’ve never seen a 3% outcome. More like 10-20% for founders of google and Facebook by IPO.  founders get to sell along the way these days, choosing to trade equity for cash.   Typically it’s 6% incubator, 10% esop, 20% dilution a couple of times—in exchange for millions.
“You gentlemen ought to expand You're going to need a helping hand, now So, gentlemen well, what about me? We'll make a little business history, now Or my name's not kroc call me ray” — @MarkKnopfler, Boom Lije That   https://t.co/FPglXGcBg7
@Thogori @rrhoover I would pay, obviously, but I do think folks can make their own call if they want to defer comp now for carry
@justbalbi @singareddynm @rrhoover Correct.   The world is not fair, and some fields are zero sum and have very limited slots (nba, VC, Oscar winners etc).

@DarrelFrater @TWistartups 💥
@DerekjAndersen @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk If founders want to go the slow way, that’s just fine (as I’ve said like 1,000x), but they will not build a decacorn with this model.
@DerekjAndersen @DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital @travisk The entire concept of angel investing &amp; venture capital is that some number of folks have outlier returns.   If you remove this concept from high-risk investing, no one would do it.   You can cherry pick individual outliers, losses &amp; wins, but that’s not intellectually honest.
@MarioATX_MD Well, @calm didn’t raise much money and skipped at least 2-3 rounds of funding!
@singareddynm @rrhoover I think this is the opposite case... this is a hack to let more folks in. Just live modestly, work half time on your side hustle and half time with @rrhoover
@EskilSteenberg Then get bank loan and/or build from profits!
@myxys @hunterwalk You got a lot of excuses kid, but not as many as the job openings at google and Facebook!
@myxys @hunterwalk If you can learn to code (lame but ok), then learn to be a sales executive and make $150-300k!
@ChrisIseman https://t.co/raozKeg3Ey
@HoldenthePage @AdamSinger @rrhoover Oh please, stop clutching your pearls and let folks decide for themselves if they want to trade 1,000 hours of work to get into the room where it happens!   Easily worth taking $0 with carry upside &amp; working a side hustle to pay bills for 6-12 months.
Or people could make their own decision if they want to take 10-15 years out of their career path by working for free for one year with @rrhoover!   Please don't discourage the secret back doors into VC by not applying! https://t.co/ASeoV7C4eq

Hawt take: indie vc / vc loan concept will have modest returns and will never create a decacorn.   Come @ me! 😂 https://t.co/DNJm2k5j5O
@valb00 This is not knee jerk, I’m just being a jerk/truth teller.   Indie VC concept is nonsense... call it what it is: a loan.  I’m cool w/founders taking all the equity &amp; bootstrapping like @craigslist almost did, &amp; others are reversing into (@buffer @wistia  ❤️❤️).
@myxys @hunterwalk Do yourself a favor and google starting salaries at fb and goog — it’s bonkers. 2-5x startups salaries.   That’s your rip cord kid... any time startup life beats you down, go take zuckerberg’s blood money!
@DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital Incorrect.   founders seeking angel investment start with the greatest angel investor of all time—me—even if they don't have a venture scale business.   90% of the time I say not yet it’s because it’s not venture scale. (almost never say no: https://t.co/aMsoEHSPER)
@DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith @indievc @LighterCapital i never see those funds in deals and i'm guessing they are doing loans... which is fine, loans are cool.
@DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith What you need to ask is "why don't lower-performing funds designed to support modest outcome businesses exist?"   the answer: investors already have muni bonds, real estate/REITS &amp; dividend paying stocks.
I encourage you to find the LPs who are looking for below market returns &amp; then pair them with all the founders you find who want to build startups that are moderate successes! 🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄 https://t.co/lL3A6ChYpy
@DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith I encourage you to find LPs who are looking for below market returns and then find the founders who want to build moderately successful businesses.
@DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith VCs &amp; their LPs are not interested in a "range of success." They want every investment to have a chance to return the entire fund. if they don't do that they don't get another fund.   It's that simple. put $5-10m into a company and need to return 20-40x with 1  to break even!

@susanlyons @bgurley Sounds interesting, how is it working out?
@cyantist @LeeJacobs @DandelionChoco Epic
@myxys @hunterwalk A founder who can't get a job?! Are you serious?   1. Learn to code  2. Learn project management  3. Learn to sell (ads, enterprise software ).
@danprimack Correct. If you invest at a $5m valuation you can do well with $250-500m exists.   It's what I do for a living, but it's very hard work because you have to make a lot of investments (I did 50+ in 2018).
@myxys @hunterwalk I've met many founders who have blown through savings and and ground without a salary!   at any point in time, any founder can stop grinding and take a cushy job for big money. That's just facts.   Being a founder is not a death sentence... It's a choice, and you can reverse it.
@DavidSpinks @hunterwalk @eringriffith Syndicates and equity crowdfunding have already done this -- but almost all founders here in the Bay Area still want the big VC check.    Why? Founders want to go big -- just like VCs!
@myxys @hunterwalk Building a company is too stressful?! Give up and make a fortune working for Facebook or Google!

@ShiraOvide Fairly standard for this to be based on the last month. In high growth startups you are growing at 2-4x+ year over year so month one and month 12 can be $100k and $600k
If you choose to take venture capital you are choosing to grow your business in the most aggressive way possible—this is not news to founders.   It’s great if you have that choice, but obviously most businesses can’t &amp; don’t have this choice—and that’s ok. 👌 https://t.co/LF8VUHT43V

@MarekZee @finkd You put your name on the side of the building you are responsible for what goes on inside it. Period.
It's fine if you suddenly realized that capitalism, fame &amp; wealth aren't what you desire, but we don't need you out here telling the next generation of founders to not hustle, get rich &amp; change the world.   True stoicism would be quietly deleting your social media accounts. 🙏
A lot of the #stoicism I see out here reeks of #narcissism, filled with the musings of rich, powerful &amp; retired entrepreneurs suddenly embracing having little and needing less—except the millions in their banks and follower counts, that we watched them build for the past decade.

@choffmann_ You can learn to be more creative, for sure.  Refined design is something you can, at the very least, learn to identify even if you never are able to build something refined.
@choffmann_ Selling is actually easy to learn, but hard for many people to practice. I think many folks feel bad talking about themselves or asking people for something.   If you love your product or service, it's much easier to look someone in the eye and say "Buy this... you will love it!"

Great question @ericlIcaden, the most important skills (semi-random order):  1. The ability to learn new skills quickly &amp; independently (resourcefulness)    2. Emotional intelligence &amp; self-awareness (comes from meditation, therapy, mentorship, reading &amp; slowing down). 3. .... https://t.co/QUQyhL014z

@kimmaicutler @georgevaldes @paulg @mattknox @DannyDeVito I like to ask people "what's was your intent?" It works well for me.
@kimmaicutler @paulg @mattknox 1. "Everyone needs money, that's why they call it money"--@DannyDeVito  2. "Changing the World" in our business is most often so a combination of: a. saving people money (uber, airbnb) b. saving people time (google) c. entertaining/distracting people (TV/movies, games, instagram)
@kimmaicutler @paulg @mattknox Perhaps this chart argues that we should study the person's intent.   i.e. Are they the alt-right/hysterical left/trolls, desperate to get page views &amp; the dopamine hit of dancing on the line, or are they someone trying to have an intelligent debate about a topic near the line?

At early stage startups, be aware of the ratio. Having 15 people with little experience can be chaos while having 10 with experience and 5 neophytes, can be magical.  That's what I do: 2/3rds seasoned, 1/3rd up and coming. How about you?
With the new trio, you will have extensive management as you train them &amp; check their work. However, "young guns" might bring a fresh perspective since they don't have a ton of experience doing it "the right way." They might be less cynical &amp; more enthusiastic as well.
Answer: Both of these models can work. For the two seasoned executives, you will have a harder time finding them, but they will stay at your company longer, and they will be less management for you and your leadership team.
Founder Scenario: You can 2 people with 10+ years experience for 100k each/$200k total, or you can hire 3 hungry folks with 3.33 years of experience each for ~$70k each/$200k.  Which one do you choose and why?
@magicsilicon my audience is founders.... addressing them specifically here. of course, it applies to everyone.
Watching talented people die from #heroin #fentanyl &amp; prescription #opioids is soul crushing.  Founders: Never touch these drugs. There is no "experimenting" with heroin or fentanyl--you will just die.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Prince, Cobain, River Phoenix, Belushi... 😢 https://t.co/9wDEiAAobu

Putin’s goal is to create chaos inside America so we don’t have the high ground and focus to contain him.   Trump was merely the best target to accomplish the maximize the chaos — it’s not personal.
Putin is smart, so if he was helping @realDonaldTrump &amp; @DonaldJTrumpJr to win the election, you can be sure he funneled tons of money into trump apartments, the inauguration fund, the @NRA &amp; other affiliated entities, to maximize the blast zone around this operation’s end.

@KylyFlyly All true. The government can be a great customer... but the founders I see obsessed with grants seem to never understand they are splitting their focus between their real customers and some government bureaucracy
@adasomg @choffmann_ If it's $1m+ without strings, it takes &lt; 30 days to secure &amp; u don't have professional investors who want to work with you, sure take it.   However, if it's Spend $3M and we *might* give you want 50% of that back, well, then you're focused on pleasing government not customers.
@choffmann_ Founders that obsess over grants don’t change the world.   Founders who obsess over customers often do.   Be a US Corp, build a large business &amp; don’t waste time begging for grants/scraps.
@keyul Both are viable, but remote work is winning hearts &amp; minds.  The growing cost difference between major &amp; smaller cities (2-4x!) Also favors remote work.  Finally, hiring a person great at X in Brooklyn is harder than hiring a person great at X in North America—or on planet earth
@JohnFiorello 1. Create custom audience of your top 1,000 targets on twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook.  2. Run adds against them &amp; track who visits your website.   3. Triple down on targeting 200 who visit your site with a free offer.   OR  A. Start a podcast, invite targets on as guests!

@Lons @mrbilldempsey Imagine airports having straight shots from 20 different entry points — and all that traffic being removed from surface streets &amp; highways. It will work.
@Lons @mrbilldempsey The tunnel system does not require having elevators—that’s just one option.   You could just as easily end the tunnel on a street, an on-ramp to a highway or into a garage.  It’s also autonomous, so cars will be 2x as dense and travel 2x as fast. So, a 10 mile run in ~5 minutes!
@jerrycolonna @fredwilson Cybersurfer! 😂
@Lons @mrbilldempsey The concept is that there is a main loop, but many offshoots where you get off. So, imagine going 100mph under the 10 from Santa Monica to DTLA, but taking an exit to staples center or dodger stadium, where a dozen elevators took people into a garage. Or Manhattan to JFK.

@davecraige @MikeIsaac @moiramack I don't speak for Uber, Lyft or Postmates, I'm a tiny shareholder, but I answered your intellectually dishonest trolling here Dave https://t.co/p6k1a9dVBC
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack The services can make it work with everyone full-time or as ICs in my opinion. The people who will lose are drivers (who will lose flexibility and have to fight for 10 hours shifts like taxi drives do) &amp; riders who will pay highers prices &amp; longer wait times.
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack That last part is what most folks miss. The drivers are signed up for multiple services. The companies know this &amp; are in a dogfight to keep the best driers between each other... not to mention fighting Walmart, Starbucks &amp; Target for team members.
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack If you force postmates to pay hourly, they will simply drop the rate to $12 an hour &amp; force those workers to be full-time and sit in their office doing other work during down time.   I think Americas can pick which model they like--esp. given such low  unemployment right now.
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack If a Postmates drive does 3 jobs in an hour &amp; each makes $10 and take 20 minutes each, you're at $30 an hour.  If they only do only 3 jobs over 2 hours it drops to $15 an hour--but they had one hour off. So, do you count that or not is the issue.
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack If you choose to work full-time, you give up controlling your work schedule. You have to show up at an office when your boss tells you &amp; you can't pick who you work for--but you get more security (maybe).  ICs choose flexibility &amp; are paid on their output.
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack Choosing to be an independent contractor means you determine your work schedule &amp; who you work for. Some people in Hollywood, tech &amp; advertising choose to be ICs or to work full-time &amp; lose flexibility &amp; maximize their earnings.   It's their right to choose.
@davecraige @adamnash @moiramack I don't speak for Uber, Lyft or Postmates, but you're being intellectually dishonest about the actual question Dave--which is your pattern.   The question is should independent contractors be able to work on a per job basis or should they be forced to work on an hourly basis.

@davecraige @facebook The critical mistake people make WRT cutting the cost of rides is that it drives massive usage---especially by folks who have limited choices (people with less money). Usage=more jobs  If you raise prices usage goes down, jobs will disappear.

#bitcoin testing the floor again.... $3,835.    Is this mining risk true @APompliano @VinnyLingham? "As I argued, once Bitcoin’s price falls below its cost of mining, the incentive to mine will deteriorate, thrusting bitcoin into a death spiral." https://t.co/WMkDcKXgOy

@sethbannon Said another way, did you cry about the end of toll both collectors or ditch diggers? Making coffee for 2,000 hours a year for 10 years is fine if a) you need the cash &amp; have no options (sometimes) and/or b) you love it more than anything else (doubtful)
@sethbannon Iit's easy to assume that eliminating manual labor will result in chaos, but we have been eliminating back-breaking/soul-crushing work for 100s of years &amp; we have record low unemployment  Who knows if the trend will continue, but I don't cry for the elimination of toll booth jobs
@sethbannon I try not to judge people's choices without knowing their intent (the opposite of what you're doing to me), but I would guess that the majority of folks making coffee are doing it for a paycheck--not because it's their life's work.... and...

Actually, @benshapiro isn’t IDW — he believes in religion over science (based on what I’ve heard). He is a fierce debater and podcaster, which makes him similar to the IDW of course.   Also, he regrets former stupid positions — a common trait in the IDW. 😂 https://t.co/f8wie5Ytoa

Having been on the receiving end of the great bounty that a free country like America can provide, to the tune of billions of dollars individually, what motivation could @google executives have to promote the oppression of vulnerable people?   What’s the story @sundarpichai?
very disappointed that @google, #larrypage, #sergeybrin &amp; @sundarpichai would build a censored search engine for communists.   How could you sleep at night knowing that  $goog would be forced to hand over journalists, religious leaders &amp; artists for torture &amp; imprisonment?

@CNBC Wait, @Fidelity &amp; other institutions are buying all their bitcoin privately--did I hear that correct @andrewrsorkin @APompliano?  Can we fact check that --- @fidelity are you building a position in bitcoin for your customers in 2018? https://t.co/5JeTFYPlOS
#bitcoinzero is still the likely case (60-70%)   if you own #bitcoin, understand it's a highly manipulated currency, with no rules or regulations.... if you didn't get in early, you're the sucker at the table.   $3,700.... ouch. https://t.co/ABh6nkE5Vh
@DavidJN79 @CNBC @Fidelity we had bitcoin folks on @twistarups about 8-9 years ago. have invested in 3-4 startups that have crypto aspects to them. I know what it's all about... it's a nice collection of technologies filled with fraud and greed, and very little consumer value to date.

Really enjoyed having @BalloonrHQ at the @launch accelerator!   We've had 70 startups in the program and some big news... next year we will welcome 50!   unlike other accelerators that host 150 startups per class, we have only seven startups per cohort (a much better model). https://t.co/1orBOPrkVb

@danielkuntz0 I agree it's good to get the greed out of the space.
Remember #bitcoin? If you bought a year ago you've lost ~70% of your money.  Oh yeah, the SEC is forcing #ICOs to refile, pay fines and give the money back..... which is *exactly* what the adults in the room said would happen.   #Crypto heads, what are the signs of hope? https://t.co/sj9J7Li5Km

I told you these #ICOs would get reversed. My understanding is these two companies have to return the money &amp; pay fines — even if the suckers sold the coin at a loss. And they have to file as a security—losing millions!  My guess is the SEC is just getting started... who next? https://t.co/R43f09Eqy3

For example, I loath @facebook &amp; it's clear to everyone that Zuckerberg has created a horrible mess for society, mental health, democracy &amp; children's development.   Was Zuck driven by greed, cluelessness or evil? I think the first two, but not the third.
I read it &amp; I enjoy @NellieBowles' work.

@salonihs @karaswisher @NellieBowles With great power comes great responsibility, and companies like @facebook have compromised our democracy &amp; our children’s mental health.

Surgery went well!   They found a small potato piece stuck in between his small and large intestine!   highly unusual, as food like this usually gets digested. Taurus is recovering, but he’s not out of the woods.   Keep sending good vibes &amp; prayers. https://t.co/IzGRilL3vt

One of our two beautiful bulldogs, Taurus, was in distress tonight &amp; is going into emergency surgery.  He’s 12, which is very uncommon for bulldogs, &amp; he has had an amazing life.

How Apple hasn’t made (another) run at Tesla is beyond me. They would sell 1m Model 3 cars if they had them in their stores—and the Model 3 will be a money printing machine at scale.   Thoughts?
Don’t feel the need to upgrade my iPad Pro, and I’m a price insensitive gadget junkie.   Feels like Apple needs a new product line — and AirPods are not it (as great as they are).
Also, I replaced my $2,700 MacBook Pro with a chrome pixel book that’s more powerful and $1,500. Replaced my $2,500 desktop/iMac with a chromebox that’s more stable for $800.   Did buy the Apple Watch 4 and its exactly the same as my Fitbit — only 3x the price.
Been thinking forever that Apple’s iPhone franchise would flatten and then decline as consumers settled into a longer upgrade cycle. I upgrade my X to the XS max and there was no noticeable difference — complete waste of money.  Perhaps the future is people skipping 3 versions https://t.co/MXIx5usyYU

@JasonHirschhorn @jack @Twitter @TwitterSupport 1/I'm guessing folks have (illegally) backed up twitter's archives.  2/I'm guessing that Twitter has this data on their backups, but I'm not sure. @TwitterSupport -- do you have any record of deleted tweets, or do you go back and purge them in your archives?
My guess is everyone will start using "https://t.co/xOSaXVfaFZ" tools -- which cost ~$15 a month. @jack, I would have paid @twitter $180 a year for this feature and we could have had the history in place.   We need #twitterprime  #twitterpro @twitter -- make it happen!

@GatorInvestor @dan_lyle @markbspiegel Doors work fine. They are flush with car to reduce drag &amp; increase mileage.  Very simple once you learn how: you push the fat part with your thumb &amp; the long bar pops out for you to grab with your other fingers.  Model X doors get a bad rap as well due to learning curve.

@davecraige @davidcohen @naval @tferriss @TheRealFreada @scottbelsky People can protest or ask for more money, sure, but at the end of the day these services are opt-in &amp; are lowering costs so that there is more demand.   If you raise the prices there will be less riders, if you pay to little the drivers opt out — it’s simple supply &amp; demand.
@davecraige @davidcohen @naval @tferriss @TheRealFreada @scottbelsky If one on demand company doesn’t pay enough, workers will go to an Amazon factory job, retail gigs or another on demand job.   Millions of folks are optioning into working in a gig fashion, if they don’t want the work they have many, many, many options in this economy.
@davecraige @davidcohen @naval @tferriss @TheRealFreada @scottbelsky I don’t speak for Uber (I’m a minor shareholder), but you’re spinning the numbers (ie counting down time, dead head time, cost of cars).  We are at record low unemployment, there are dozens of on demand options &amp; Amazon &amp; other factory jobs are raising rates.  It’s a free market!

@rafat $10m a year probably means they are hitting ~100,000 hotel room nights, right? 30-40,000 folks staying for 2-3 nights.   Means the city is giving $200-300 per participant. If each person spends $2,000 while in town, seems reasonable — since no one is going there anyway (for tech)

@dhh Agreed. Many Gen-X members are imitating their younger millennial cousins and focusing in "working to live, not living to work."   Also seeing folks give up on the major cities and take advantage of teh massive arbitrage of living in Austin &amp; Tokyo vs. NY and SF.

Amazon really went out on a limb here raising minimum wage from 11 to $15 — right before mandatory $15 kicks in across many geographies, and as unemployment hits record lows. 🙄   @Walmart still holding at $11 an hour... they will crack in days and match Amazon. https://t.co/SM1QKRExRw

@KevinCTofel @jjesse Does anyone build custom ChromeBoxes? Would be cool to buy one with 32 gigs of ram and absurdly fast graphics card and SSD ---- make stupid fast, absurldy stupid fast. I love chrome OS

@KevinCTofel @jjesse I'm in love with PixelBook2 so far... can't figure out how to get Google Assistant and Play to work with my google domains email, but other than that it's a game changer. Just want to spend $3,000 on a laptop with absurd performance. :-) Also, want to buy a desktop unit...
@KevinCTofel @jjesse Why aren’t there super pro models of chromebooks? Like 32 gigs. And powerful desktop models?

1/Learn to code.  2/Learn to recruit coders to work for equity and/or deferred comp.   If you can’t do either or both of these things then most investors assume you are not qualified or worthy of investment.   That’s reality, you won’t change it. https://t.co/cO0y1TNx1d

Cult like status spreads so far, wide and deeply that those wide it can, literally, print money and take over industries.
Every day @Tesla delivers hundreds of these Model 3s to fans... who then become super fans... who then inspire more fans... who become super fans....   .. that leads to “cult like status” — which is what @Apple, @Amazon Prime, @robinhood, @Uber, @airbnb, @calm &amp; @Tesla share. https://t.co/8lHH8dGtV4

@heydave7 @Tesla @reidhoffman @sama @Benioff @algore @elonmusk That’s an amazing list... how did I wind up on it?! 😂😂
TFFL: @tesla fans for life!  These customers will buy 3-4 more Teslas each in my experience, &amp; they will convert a dozen friends &amp; family members as well.  Every Tesla sold right represents dozens more based on the real-world vitality of these spectacular objects d’art! 🚘🌈❤️ https://t.co/7zzuAJ2Cz2
A savvy move by @elonmusk.   Clearly he was willing to fight for the truth, but this shows he wants to focus on the fight that matters most: building the world’s greatest cars!

I’m not a lawyer, but I’m guessing that he would have a good shot — which is why he didn’t take the deal.   The world will not think less of Elon if he does take a deal — he should know that.   SEC &amp; E both have good intent I’m sure, seems they are very close to a resolution. https://t.co/4fRnwk7RLb

Take the deal E, make a deal SEC— @SpaceX &amp; @Tesla are two of America’s most important companies.  We need Elon in the game, we need these companies to keep America competitive on the global stage — not to mention for the environment &amp; national security (in the case of SpaceX).

Take the deal.
It’s really early and I’m awake thinking critically, which means I’m on @CNBC with @carlquintanilla &amp; @jonfortt at 8am.   Have analysis and feelings to share about the Tesla, Elon &amp; the SEC with everyone.   What’s your take? https://t.co/kqKOpM5VEj
@shillycrypto I don’t trade public stocks. I invest in private companies (have a Robo portfolio).
What are your thoughts? What’s the appropriate punishment — if any — in your minds?
How long would the SEC v Elon take to play out if it went to trial? a year or two? three?   Independent of the tweets, I’m concerned the punishment  of banning Elon from Tesla would be more damaging to shareholders than the going private tweets ever could be (if they even were!).
@sama It’s a great product
@moskov When are you coming on @TWistartups?!? Cc @JacqKD
We pay for @Asana and we don’t need to, as the free version is more than enough for our modest team of 14 @launch.   We pay because we appreciate how awesome the product is and we want to see @moskov and his team succeed.   It’s a great product. https://t.co/VTytmFuGuW

@andrewbogut i'm going savage from now on.... gloves are off
Decided I'm going to spend half hour on twitter every day, from my desktop &amp; turn over a bunch of tables -- then turn Twitter off until the next night.   Been a winning strategy so far.
I just re-read this tweet.... I'm starting to sound like Trump. BIG PLANS with GREAT PEOPLE -- REALLY, REALLY GREAT PEOPLE. EVERYONE KNOWS, I KNOW THE BEST PEOPLE AND HAVE THE BIGGEST PLANS! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious. This kid got the wool pulled over his eyes with Steve Jobs' classic "access journalism" trick. Zuck shows up for an event, sells $2k tickets, drives page views... &amp; the journalist defends him for fear losing access.   Zuck's behavior has been horrible since day one. https://t.co/jZVppZW8KU
Loved my time in Tokyo. Thanks so much for translating my book and making me feel so welcome.   I will be back to Japan.... soon. have some big plans with some great people. https://t.co/A4m2fxE5QO
@markgelband It's access journalism... oldest trick in Steve Jobs' book.  This is how it works in tech journalism. Josh gets access to Zuck and that sells $2,000 tickets to conferences &amp; gets you tons of page views.  It also gets you a nice link for your resume. It's sad.
@JoshConstine You got conned kid.   It's called access journalism... he worked you over. Don't be star struck. All Zuck has ever done is screw over the user base. Look at that facts, not the PR speak and press tours.   Judge people on their actions, not their media training. Be more cynical.
