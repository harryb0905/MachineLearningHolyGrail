Tatum goes deep to snatch the Skills Challenge  https://t.co/e6CZNrsNeg
Dirk Nowitzki, on his determination to get every shot up in time in the three-point contest: "I was hustling harder in between racks than I do on transition defense usually."
They gave Diallo a winning score on the last dunk as a reward for the dunk over Shaq, just like Denzel Washington’s "Training Day” Oscar was really for “Malcolm X”
Diallo with the double-homage to Vince Carter — dunking over a center (Shaq), hanging his elbow in the rim.
We don’t pay enough attention to another term Silver uses frequently: equality of opportunity. Notice he doesn’t say equality of outcome. There’s only so much the league can do to help bad teams get good. Most of it is up to the teams. Focus should be on them.
Adam Silver often mentions “unintended consequences” of collective bargaining agreements. There’s also the unspoken CBA trap doors: the league can’t keep players from taking less money to go where they want.

If you could go back to 1991 and tell everyone involved in that last tweet what the future held in store for us, we'd be more amazed by that than by the fact you had time traveled.
I was telling Scottie Pippen tonight about the time Rachel Nichols walked into the Daily Northwestern office and told me she wanted to write about sports. That was the start of the journey that led to her hosting the show he appears on now.
I know most of you don't read the bylines, but next time take a glance and be happy for that person for a moment.
Something I hadn't really thought of before, even though I've lived it most of the past 27 years: whenever you read a story in a major outlet about someone doing what they love, the same can probably be said about the writer.

He told me a little more about it. I said I'd try to be there.  "What do you mean TRY?!!?" he thundered back at me. Later, I saw his wife in the corridor. "You know you have to go now, right?" she advised me. Yeah, I understood. I went. And afterward I went up to him so he'd know
I would always stop and pay respect to him whenever I walked by. One time I had read about a Jackie Robinson event he was speaking at in the upcoming week and I asked him some details....
Frank Robinson would sit behind the basket at Laker games almost unnoticed, as if he were not one of the greatest home run hitters in MLB history and its first African American manager...

@RealDavidIsrael @BeatKentucky I was into Moonlighting (in high school) Never really got into Hill Street Blues. I’ve read about how groundbreaking it was, but fear it would pale in comparison to Sopranos and what came afterward
@meghanmcpeak 100% factual

Reading that made me want to doubt every sports/ celebrity profile I've ever read,  because you wonder what's been left out. But then you wonder if that applies to this as well. The central question is whether you believe Todd Maronovich has finally discovered his own truth
This is a phenomenal story. It does such a good job of forcing you to question everything you think you know about someone that I even doubt its own authenticity.

My final Sopranos thought of the day: you won’t find better acting than James Gandolfini and Edie Falco in the pool house in the “Whitecaps” episode. If I taught an acting class I would just show that scene again and again.  https://t.co/tCnoQ9NGVh
The only internet ad that ever got me to buy something on the spot was a Sopranos coffe mug and shot glass that popped up on my screen one day https://t.co/2xwQLeNiVZ
I’m 👎🏽on the Sopranos finale as well. But I don’t know anyone who loves the show who didn’t love the pilot https://t.co/yGTOAH2yeR
“Mad Men” didn’t hit its stride till Season 1 finale (“Carousel”). Breaking Bad took off when Gus arrived. Although, on rewatch, both series had foundational moments - practical thesis sentences — in the pilots. Just not as good TV as Sopranos pilot. https://t.co/U3Wwn2XCVY
That makes sense. Makes me feel old, but it makes sense. https://t.co/GEyI5iAO47
@SnowflakeDrizzy @StereoTheSecond Which version though? That’s another reason The Sopranos theme wins this for me.
@asharma24 But it definitely got worse when Tony was comatose or when homeboy off to New Hampshire. That dip is what keeps it from definitely holding the top spot in my eyes
How could you forget about the ducks? They were the key to the episode. Also signaled the important role animals would play in the series. especially Pie O My. Tony cared about animals more than he cared about people. https://t.co/6crkiQ1ttU
@kevin_ablaza Dont know what the hell that has to do with a Sopranos conversation in 2019, but for the record I was working for ESPN then, not the LA Times. Not that my employer would affect my prediction anyway.
.@StereoTheSecond once asked what we think of when we see the HBO intro. In my mind it always triggers “...woke up this morning...” https://t.co/Hg6sMLWNmf
While I’m not sure “The Sopranos” is the best TV drama of all time, I will say definitively that it had the best pilot episode. I bailed out on “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad” after a few shows, then came back after the strong word of mouth. But “Sopranos😀” had me hooked from Day 1 https://t.co/C7SeViWJLr

The lesson: research the people and places you get your loans from. And have that loan locked down before you get too far down the road to buying a place. --30--
I sold right before that tech company corridor in Virginia took off. Real estate zoomed. I missed out. Made the mistake of Zillowing the house to see the value a while back. Made me wanna cry. Worth 3X what I sold it for....
after about 12 months, I needed to sell. Had a mini cash crisis. I managed to clear a few thousand (much-needed) dollars on the sale, but I'd sold under duress. With a better mortgage I could have MADE money each month and held on while it appreciated...
Then the 2 years ran out, and my mortgage went up. If I had a regular ARM (adjustable rate mortgage) I would have been good, because rates had gone down. But because of that gimmicky mortgage I had, it went the other way. i hiked the rent, but still lost money on it...
It was all good at first. I had my own condo, paying less than what I'd been paying in rent. Then I got the job in L.A., which meant leaving my condo northern Virginia after only 1 year. I rented it out at a slight monthly loss the first year....
I had a shady loan agent who couldn't deliver the goods when it was time to close on the condo. My realtor was furious, but she improvised a way to get me into the house: a 2/1 buydown mortgage, where I'd pay a bit more upfront but have lower monthly payments 1st 2 years...
As well as my last home experience went (sold at the peak of the market for double what I had left on the mortgage), I made some rookie mistakes when I bought my first condo...

It really hit me after Randall Simon whacked one of the Brewers sausage racers with a bat. The next day I realized I  to go on TV and talk about a professional baseball player hit a person in a sausage costume. What a great country. Thanks for the ride. It's time for No. 3601
We hung in there. Most importantly, the viewers gave us a chance, then kept watching. So grateful that you have enabled us to get paid to have so much fun for so long.
Managing 5 shots from separate feeds all the time is hard. I realized that the first time I went to DC and sat in on a show taping. It didn't help that most of the panelists were clueless about how to do TV. When we debuted we got killed...even by our own newspapers...
More relaunch thoughts: I remember sitting down for my first ATH rehearsal 16 years ago. I had no idea what was going on. Heard these weird sound effects in my earpiece. Woody was saying all this crazy stuff. It would take hours to tape the show as crew learned the ropes

Joe Horn actually played in the flip phone era, meaning stadiums weren't filled with camera-carrying people. How far ahead of time did Michael Thomas have to plant that cell phone for there to be no one around to post about it? Did he have an accomplice? I'VE GOT QUESTIONS!
Only way this could be better would be if he actually called Joe Horn on it https://t.co/hwlyBgxwY7

Buehler and Eovaldi between them pitched 13 innings, allowed 5 hits and 1 earned run. And somehow Alex Wood is the winning pitcher
Okay, Dodger fans, who among you has enough cell phone power left to get an Uber?
Muncy finally got it calibrated. Eovaldi does NOT deserve to be the losing pitcher. So unfair.
Let's hear it for routine ground ball outs
Eovaldi has thrown 90 pitches tonight. That's more than 4 of the 6 starting pitchers in this series so far.

This was a smart, balanced column. But I still think the real baseball numbers problem is the stat people care the most about — home runs — was devalued by PEDS. If hardcore fans can’t get excited by big HR numbers anymore then how can casual fans?  https://t.co/127q4qvTJ2

Flashback brought on by that Heisman House ad: Perhaps the most random thing I've ever encountered came after a round of golf in NJ, when I saw a Heisman trophy sitting on a table. It was Mike Rozier's. He lived nearby, and brought it with him to the course. Wouldn't you?

@CandaceDBuckner The realism makes it relatable to an often-ignored audience. That’s the draw. But the absurdity is the payoff.
With Issa and Lawrence we saw their flaws right away. They decided to slow down and get around to showing us Daniel’s flaws this season and it’s no fun going through that process.
Insecure is best when it’s absurd, much like Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm. Only absurdity so far in S3 was the Lyft fight. Best part of the season.
Issa’s property management gig, Molly’s new job and a potential job switch by Issa all have the chance to jumpstart this season. Because Issa staying at Daniel’s house and Daniel’s music issues were both a drag. https://t.co/N1GBFayb7P

@TerranceHarris @ElLayJay The Lakers traded for Kareem, signed Shaq as free agent, traded for Kobe’s draft rights. They won coin tosses to get the No. 1 picks for Magic and Worthy, and more admirable to you?
@TerranceHarris The freedom-lover in me likes to see athletes get to choose where they work. The manager in me likes to see teams rewarded for building winning cultures, not for losing games
@TerranceHarris What’s so noble about building through the draft?

@JonesOnTheNBA And getting down to the nitty gritty, if you make your social media accounts public does that make you a public figure?. It’s an important legal distinction
@JonesOnTheNBA It’s already established that you can be recorded in public. And the fine print on your ticket says you can be recorded at a sporting event. But does being “internet famous” make you a public figure, with the lack of protection that implies?
Nah, this deserves a parent of the year nomination https://t.co/5mTVUEavLg

@FearTheSword Dropping the banner did make for a poignant image in this ad though. Maybe that’s what they have in mind https://t.co/HJbPLHhd3z
@FearTheSword If Nike wants to brand LeBron as a true icon than it shouldn’t matter what jersey he’s wearing at the moment. That banner is a landmark. What else in town gets photographed more?

You'll have the Lakers reality show entertain you in the regular season, an unlocked Eastern Conference playoffs with young teams trying to break through and then the champ will be the predicted team just like the Bulls always won in the 90s era y'all are so nostalgic about
@schuey20 You won't hear the small-market teams complaining when the Warriors come into town and sell every variably priced ticket. Nor will they complain when they cash their revenue-sharing checks.

Of the last 10 MVP winners — KG, Nash, Dirk, Kobe, LeBron, Rose, Durant, Curry, Russ and Harden — Durant and LeBron are the least surprising based on draft-night projections.
Shaq is another one who delivered what was expected. I’d say Tim Duncan, too. I put LeBron in the “surpass” category, even with all the hype when he entered the league
Kevin Durant is one of the few players who landed right on the mark we set for them when they entered the league. Most careers either surpass our expectations or disappoint.

One last random thought on the vanishing big man: remember Nikola Pekovic? That guy literally vanished. He’s been out of the league for two years.
One thought in the Elam Ending is to start it with a jump ball. If they did, with the requirement that the two people competing for the tipoff had to be on the court at the 4:00 mark, that makes big men more valuable at the end of games.

You can even give Durant a hockey assist on that Curry-to-Draymond bucket
Kevin Durant should not have to do anything else after this game. No media interviews, no carrying his bag to the bus. Some other Warrior should cut his steak for him too.

Jordan Bell: 4-5 field goals, 10 points, 6 rebounds, 1 KG block
Durant to Curry at halftime: “I got you.” This is why Curry got on that plane to New York in 2016. He’s 1 for 8 in this game, but the Warriors are still in it thanks to Durant’s 24 points.

LeBron with the junior skyhook. It's amazing how few hook shots we see these days.
I think the Warriors' inability to get separation is a byproduct of 4 straight Finals meetings. Cavs don't freak out when Warriors look ready to blow it open. They've been through all of it. Warriors' only 10-point lead was in OT of Game 1

@AllieRenison @dcsportsbog Just as wrong as trying to compare the popularity of T.J. Oshie (400,000 twitter followers) to Stephen Curry (12.5 million twitter followers). And you expect Curry to ride BART to the Finals?
@AllieRenison @dcsportsbog You took a nice moment for a hockey player and tried to use it to elevate that sports' athletes over other sports. Not necessary. And factually wrong.
@dcsportsbog @AllieRenison Here's Nick Young, dancing with kids on his birthday during the NBA Finals. Should I add "You'd never see hockey players doing this"? https://t.co/OiR8seCwnz
@dcsportsbog @AllieRenison I mean, if I used your line of thinking I would say "Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson have been employed in ads for cars, online realtors and milk. You'd never see hockey players getting those national endorsements."
@AllieRenison @SFBART @dcsportsbog Did you ever think that maybe NBA players are 50 times more likely to be recognized in public, thus more likelu to be swarmed by fans on a train?
@dcsportsbog @AllieRenison Why did you feel it was necessary to take a cute moment and try to use it as a way to establish some sort of character superiority of NHL players over NBA and NFL players?

By the way: good job by Mike Breen and Co. to alert the viewers of the possibility that the block/charge call could be changed during the restricted area view. That’s an obscure rule and they were on it.
Ty Lue went there: "robbed"
@DarthAmin That wound up being some Johnnie Cochran-level working of Lawler's Law
All those buckets were bonus points for the Cavs. Scoring with LeBron barely having to cross halfcourt. Saving his energy for the stretch run
It’s allllmost like LeBron checked in and said, “Let me get my assist numbers up.”
