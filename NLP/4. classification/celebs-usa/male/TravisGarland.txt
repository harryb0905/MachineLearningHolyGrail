you've made tens of millions from generous contributions of people in your community. contributions that paid for that church @joelosteen
@shea_jordan figure of speech.
your neighbors are without food + shelter while you sat back with your doors closed all weekend asking for prayers + donations. @joelosteen https://t.co/qNpIpOCm47
+ only after the entire world shamed you online. the furniture store down the street opened their doors before your church did @joelosteen
you literally have a refuge in the middle of a flooded city + all you did this wknd was put up a donations link on your website. @joelosteen
deeply disappointed @joelosteen. that House belongs to God + was built for people in need. you should have been the first to open your doors

but first...
and this is just the first EP. UPPERS+DOWNERS vol. I drops next week. go &amp; tell everybody.
play them when you're drunk. when you're happy. when you're sad. when you're high. when you're with your friends. when you're ________.
i'm the same as you. take these songs. share them with your friends. play them when you're getting ready. when you're alone.
i feel all the things you feel. i feel pain &amp; heartbreak &amp; joy &amp; love &amp; lust &amp; dissapointment &amp; depression &amp; fear &amp; rejection &amp; loneliness.
but i just want you to fucking have these songs! i just want you to know that i am going through the same shit that you are.
it's as raw as i've ever been. as open as i've ever been. none of these are as polished or as perfect as i'd like them to be...
but the majority of these records were dreamed up, written, produced &amp; recorded by me, in my apartment in downtown LA.
this is the first project i've done entirely on my own. i had help here &amp; there on a record or two...
i've dedicated myself to my craft. songwriting, engineering, vocal production, mixing, pushing myself as a vocalist &amp; as a creative.
when i started in this industry, i was just a kid from texas who loved to sing. over the years, countless late nights in the studio...
the last few years have been some of the craziest of my life. love, loss, growth... extreme highs &amp; lows. those early 20's are crazy af.
this next project is for my fans, for all the people that show me so much love &amp; support. i'm giving it away for free on soundcloud.

Do your research. Check your facts. Take everything with a grain of salt. There's always three sides to everything.
And the worst part is that people blindly swallow up what is being fed to them.

Think for yourself. Stop letting other people tell you what you like, what you dont, whats good or bad. You have a mind of your own, use it.
Theres enough people trying to bring you down, you dont need that shit in your circle. Tend your garden. Kill the weeds so flowers can grow.
If someone is constantly making you feel less than, there is absolutely no place for them in your life.
