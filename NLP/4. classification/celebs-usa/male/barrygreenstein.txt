17 going out of his way for someone else to help make a memory. He softened as he got a little older, I think we all do,
16 Gav changed his flight so he could pop into the city and spend an afternoon with me where I skipped out on work. Typical Gavin stuff –
15 I saw him less the last few years but did have a night in Vegas with him and a day in San Francisco, and they were special to me.

12 but in a lot of ways that is what’s perfect about it, and him.   We talked poker, life, love, struggles, antagonized the living hell out
11 He, in many ways, is what life should be: full of love and loudness. It ain’t ever going to be a smooth ride, and neither was Gavin,
10 difficulties and struggles, and so was Gavin. He encapsulated every piece of that and that’s why I think we all loved him so much.

8 I think that’s why we identified with each other so well, on a primal level, despite having wildly different experiences.
7 Let’s not sugar coat it though, Gavin was a bit of a mess, complete with inner demons that would rival most purgatories.
6 and he was the soul of everything that we created. He made up for his lack of common sense with a double sized dose of love.
5 He affectionately called me his “little bro” and I did always feel that connection with him. His spirit was larger than life,
4 wonderfully talented cast of characters, raising hell, and sharing a lot of good times and a lot of bad times.

...the best hand and I see a 230k missed opportunity.  Before I can get angrier at myself the river is dealt, and it's seven. 86o scoops.
When the other folder says he had A8, the final caller says how can you fold trips and tables 86 offsuit. It's clear to everyone I folded...
But the raiser calls so quickly, I'm now glad I folded but fear I might see two smaller flushes. The live one turns over Jc9s for a straight
... in signs so I fold hoping the first caller moves in and proves me right. He folds and later claims he had A8.  I want to call now.
I think the all-in guy has a smaller flush. I'm afraid the first caller has a full house and called to trap the flushes in. I don't believe
A small crowd gathers as I tank. Moorman joins the crowd which I take as a sign to call. Would he ever fold the nut flush in a chiplead pot?
We all have around 70k. First guy calls, next guy raises to 35k.  Action players moves in. My turn and I have no idea what to do.
Did someone flop 7s full?  Two of the callers have been very live. I fired out 10k, hoping for folds or crying calls. Should I have checked?
Flop 8c8h7c.  Checked to me. I bet 4500.  Three callers. Only big blind folded. Turn 10c giving me the nut flush. The small blind checks.
I hoped I'd get a walk from people folding to see day 2.  Instead I got four callers, one two to my left, the button, and the blinds.
... a gift double up to 74k as the director announced last three hands.  Blinds 500-1000, I opened under the gun for 2200 with Ac2c.
The play level is noticeably weaker in these $3500 WPTs than the $10ks.  After being short all day from some failed semi bluffs, I got ...

I just got rivered in a pot for 12 million. Fortunately, it's at the 50k/100k play money table on PokerStars.
including my 6k call. If I call and also call 7k on the river, my expectation is ( (9 x 29) - (2 x 7) )/11 = 247/11 = 22.5 chip ev.
If he's bluffing with a club he has 8 outs out of 44 cards, which is a 9 to 2 underdog. If I raise on the turn, I pick up 22k right away ...
“@Wretchy: @barrygreenstein I think you played that hand pretty horribly on all streets” Thanks for the encouragement.
@zackmorrisfive If he's going to fire 7k or more on the river when he's bluffing, it's better to call on the turn, even if he has a club.
“@robertcroak:  did u tell us how much he had left when he net small on river?” He started with 5k more than I had.
“@TeamLal: I would shove on river, he can only call you with nuts, and if your read was it wasn't the nuts, he can't call.” Winning decision
This guy had done nothing out of the ordinary for two hours, then he makes a strange bluff that turned into an inadvertent semi-bluff.
I decided to call. He said, "Good call. You win." He looked back at his cards and said, "I only have the four of clubs." He tabled 4c4h.
I'm going to sleep. I'll let you know what happened when I wake up.
3) raise my last 9k and turn my hand into a bluff, hoping he will fold a small flush.  It seemed he didn't have the nuts with his 7k bet.
Looking at 29k in the pot it seemed I had three choices. 1) fold and assume he has a flush. 2) call, hoping he has a small set or worse, ...
The ugly 10c came on the river. He thought a few seconds and bet 7k. Why not more? Does he have the small set? Does he have a small flush?
I decided to call since he'll probably leave me with some chips if a blank comes and he flopped a flush. I'm hoping he has a smaller set.
Flop came Q53, all clubs. He checked. I bet 1500. He raised to 3500. I called. 8s on turn. He bet 6k. I can raise, or call with 16k behind.
For my poker playing friends, here are the gruesome details: I had 27k at 75-150 blinds. UTG opened to 450 and I 3bet to 1300 with QhQd.

Degen is playing and not taking regular bathroom breaks.
“@BrittainFraley: Just passed @barrygreenstein playing ofc on his iPad in line for the bathroom. I don’t feel like a degen now” ...
“@DPUNeil: @barrygreenstein playing 1 Drop Barry?” I'm boycotting $100k+ events until I have a spare $100k to throw away!
It was a long trip but it was necessary to clear my head so I could play better poker: http://t.co/8ojMi6xkh2

“@Hubcapchaser: @barrygreenstein from Agro player ..I'm missing you Barry where did you go?” The same place you went: the rail!
Aggro player told me it's the worst thing for me that he's on my left." I replied, "it would be much worse if you were at another table."
“@RealBigpotsUTG:  you played very passively 5/4 handed down IMHO. Card dead or strategic choice?” Dead 3 handed and Marco kept drawing out.

Flopped a set of fives vs  KK and was about to be huge chipleader. But a K came on the turn and I lost 340k pot. Dbled the next hand to 140k

The guy who cracked my AA opened with AJo. I called with 22 in the big blind. Flop J42. He bet. I raised. He moved in. I called.  Turn 5...
I folded incorrectly with 10s to shove and reshove over my open. They had 4s and 7s. Dbled with JJ &gt; AK. Lost AA &lt; KJ. 81 left.  I have 88k.

decent cards and a few gifts I accumulated 65k in chips. 54BB at 600-1200 tomorrow.

My mother told me if you have nothing good to say don't say anything at all. So I haven't bothered to mention my bustouts the last two days.
“@FiggBruce:  Still 442 million hands to go, Will be several days yet” Thanks. I haven't noticed a hand number since about April 15, 2011.

Slightly tweetworthy. 120 are left. Average is 23k. I've climbed over that to 25k. #wsop5
“@CharlesKhing:  yeah in the espn video on archie?” Yep you're right. He was known as that at the time.  He did put it all on the line.
@CharlesKhing I don't remember saying that. Are you sure you got that quote correct?  Archie gambled the biggest that one summer though.
It doesn't seem tweetworthy but I played day 1 of the stud8/omaha8 event and finished with a paltry 7k. 175 are left. Average is 16k. #wsop5
Sorry Joey.  That's the message I have for you after your Cubs swept my Sox. http://t.co/RYRaJ9I4ea
He went back to his post at the door and so I guess I was wrong. Rooster hair is apparently a fashion statement.
I whispered his hair was messed up and he probably should comb it. He said "Like a rooster, right?" I said, "It's not intentional, right?"
One benefit to being older or very young is you can say anything truthful without it being considered too insulting or fighting words.
But his hair was sticking up strangely in the back. I was thinking I should mention it.  He asked me if I needed to talk about anything.
After bubbling my first event I went to the bank to get more ammunition. I was greeted at the door by a well-dressed gentleman in suit &amp; tie
I shoved 10h9h on the button. Big blind woke up with kings. Flopped a pair, turned a straight draw. Blanked the river. Out of #wsop2.
Dinner break. 65 left. Average is 111k. I have a disappointing 25k. 10BB #wsop2
AcKc all in preflop vs Mike Sowers' 10 10. Board ran out Q5342. Stinky way. Lost back 20k the next hamd with 10 10. I now have 80k.
I just lost to a flush draw on the river for 100k. I have 60k left which is average with 120 players left. #wsop2
I held off Jonathan Little's flush draw and then coolered Waxman with AA vs AK. 140 left. Average is 52k. I have 110k. 110BB #wsop2
“@zlavy: Who are you with” Keith lehr, gavin griffin, jonthan little, alex Kuzmin, David Vamplew, and Steve Brecher.
I sat down in the 5k and didn't know anyone at the table. Unfortunately, it wasn't my table. I know everyone at mine and that's not good.
End of day 1. 210 left. Average is 35k. I have 51k. 85BB. #wsop2
Won a 15k pot with AK vs QQ when a king flopped. Then got AK vs QQ for the 4th time today for 35k pot. Board KQ6A9. Down to 50k. Avg 26k.
This time QQ opened.  Short stack 66 shipped. I reshipped with AK. QQ calls.  66 flops quads. Board runs out small. Still have 60k. 200BB
I raised in with AcKc. Got 3bet by QQ. 88 shipped his short stack. I shoved. QQ called. Ace flopped. Up to 67k. 235BB Average is 17k.
“@Vino_Taur: what was the action preflop?” I raised in. He slowplayed his aces. He made a small raise of my bet on the flop.
Flop was K 9 7 for my J10.  The turn was an 8. Got all in vs AA. Up to 31k from my 15k start in the 5k wsop event. #wsop2
“@SuddenlyBryce:  you misplayed your fantasy land hand” taking into consideration my results against you, I've been doing that a lot.
“@NYRambler:  I really hope you hit the 6s on the river on him.  #lucksackbarry” I put the Ks up top early and got saved on card 12 with 6s.
Danny Dang has refused to play his river card on this hand. Maybe he broke his iPad. http://t.co/ZxycGsdLn6
“@MrZeroVB:  or if you need a cure for insomnia :)” Don't give up on it. I chose this link because Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy are great.
If you compete at games against your partner you'll probably enjoy this play: The Gin Game. http://t.co/EmHLMH0bhA
“@QuadKeenan: yes, see my video with shaun on youtube, but some people in Europe were playing you are only allowed 1 return trip to fantasy.
“@AlexGoomezz: how many tournaments you plan to play?” I'll be playing in one everyday but making several day threes will lower that number.
I haven't responded to requests to contact me on Twitter.  I'll be easily accessible at the Rio during the entire WSOP.
"@BJNemeth: Restricting liquids is one of the stupidest aspects of airport security. And that’s really something." They worried I'd drink it
I was already late. It might not have been worth the risk to try to smuggle a Coke bottle out of France. Living dangerously?
My information was recorded and I was nicely told to not take my bag on the flight if it set off alarms. Not complaining ...
The person who found it  only told the person who discussed it with me that my carry-on bag was flagged.
My sister-in-law collects distinct coke products. So I bought a bottle at Nice Airport.  It was discovered at the transfer in London.
@orangegrinder @haralabob Spoke on shows about it several times. Hamilton, Matloubi, amd Pierson are the apparent perpetrators.
“@haralabob: @barrygreenstein how long after did you interview Travis?” http://t.co/g9tt90lmPB
@fanexfox @haralabob the interview was webcast live with micon and wittelles. 2+2 doesn't allow posts referring to their stuff.
@haralabob Russ convinced me Travis was behind it until I interviewed Travis and talked about the tapes. You were out of the loop by then.
“@mustberigged: Could you post the link” Search for my name and open face. Someone out up their copy of what will be on pokerstars.tv.
For those who missed it on the ept stream, the intro to openface I did with @stapes and the hand play I did with @shaundeeb are on YouTube.
@DianeDawson Don't be discouraged. Some of the computer apps know what cards are coming. Practicing against them is nevertheless helpful.
Raised on the button with KQo. Both blinds called. Flop KQ3 with two diamonds. Got all in vs 33. Nothing good came. Out of #eptgrandfinal
Two bad levels. 180 left. Average is 89k. I have 70k. 44BB #eptgrandfinal
240 left. Average is 67k. I have 110k. 110BB #eptgrandfinal
“@devilfish2011:  Should be riveting I"m tuning in asap.”  I'll be using various multi-syllable words in a dialect you can't understand.
I'll be doing commentary on a live OFC game in 30 minutes, also on the live stream. The only issue is everyone is afraid of @shaundeeb.
“@Mystro72:  Can you tweet the link please? Thx!!!” It was on the ept live stream. I assume it will eventually end up at pokerstars.tv.
The webcast for OFC is going to start in 30 minutes here in Monte Carlo. Early than planned so I can do some teaching.
@DaneCJorgensen I break my stories to create some suspense although I may end up just annoying people instead.
I thought I had a good story but nothing compared to the heart the Bulls showed without Luol Deng, Hinrich and Rose. Go into Miami and win.
Old guy turns over two black tens. Jd on the turn. River Kc.  End of day 1a. Avg is 60k. I have 70k. 88 BB. #eptgrandfinal
Flop 7c3s2s. Old guy bet 5200. Young guy calls. Flop is too big, so I ship my 27k.  Old guy calls quickly and I fear AA. Young guy folds.
However, the guy who 3-bet was older than me and I had not been  3-bet in around 40 opened hands.  I played it as a suited ace and called.
I got three bet to 3200 and a guy on the button called after acting like he might reraise.  Normally, this would be an automatic 4 bet.
I finally got back to my 30k starting stack with three hands to go. I picked up AsKs and raised in for 1400 with the blinds at 300-600.
I grinded up to 25k. Lost with KK. Down to 15 with an hour to go for the day. I went on a run off winning pots preflop or with flop C-bets.
I anted down to 4k and moved in with Ah8h. Called by AQ. 8 on the turn gave me a stay of execution. From this point I played a lot of hands.
We were moved to the feature table and I was having difficulty staying awake. I played ipad letterpress with Joey to keep my mind active.
Then I raced with QQ vs duhamel's AK. Flopped a Queen. Busted Jonathan. Up to 25k. Then QQ vs Watson's AK. Ace on flop. Crippled to 6k.
I kept three betting my small suited connectors. I picked up draws but was unable to outrun my opponent's big pairs. Down to 15k from 30.
Usually the dreaded combination of bad luck and bad play dooms you, but this was closer to bad play and no miracles.
I got a bad table draw in what looked like a good field. Haxton, Watson, duhamel, Becker. Too tired to grind, I played fast early.
I had been up all night playing open face. I can play limit poker on no sleep, but in no-limit one mistake can cost you your stack.
I came to the casino at 1pm and was informed that I was scheduled to do an open face Q&amp;A tomorrow so I had to play day 1a today.
I was scheduled to play day 1b of the Monte Carlo EPT Grand Final. I flew in a day early to play the £2k open face event. #eptgrandfinal
I hope you like long stories. I was too tired and annoyed to tweet updates as they happened, so I'll recap the day.
@pantybandit1 I've been called worse in Farsi as well as English. But I was innocent in your case.
@3ranges meet up with the late shift floorman Daniel if you have a chance.
@3ranges When you go to Aria, let me know who's playing in the biggest game, and I'll get you your money.
@3ranges Are you going to be playing poker somewhere?
@pantybandit1 I've never called security on anyone in my life. Last night a floorman said some guys wanted to take a picture and I said ok.
@pantybandit1 I have no idea what you're talking about.
“@mdesjard16:  @edarriola Isn't Ed disqualified since he did not give pokerstars ID? ;)”  Nice try Marc. You were tied for third anyway.
“@3ranges:I won't be in Vegas until the WSOP but I can have someone meet you or I'll see you when you show up at the Series.
“@Steve_3791:  well the one for the mini comes in around 200 quid, so trebly that and convert ~ $1,000” £200 = $305. Very close.
@3ranges western union or meet me in Las Vegas during the wsop. Or have me give it to a friend who goes to big events.
“@3ranges:  Barry i was closest! Only 2 cents off”  Yes you were. I never envisioned 1000 replies. I owe you double for punitive damages.
Not sure if you can read the attachment, but it cost 326.98 without labor. I'll haven't checked who was closest. http://t.co/wVN2wZqtE3
Someone guessed 329 and there were about 20 other guesses closer than the mode guess of 350.
“@edarriola: @barrygreenstein $325.99” Ed is the closest to 326.88. Saved me from paying the three people who guessed 325.
All the stoners who guessed $420 were a little high!
“@dmclarney:  $15,000” You have the highest guess. I expect you'll be getting spam from auto parts salesmen after this tweet.
“@victorramdin:  $ 2.975” Guess which friend of mine is going to have to do the transfer since I have no money in my PS account?
“@burrrrrberry: @barrygreenstein did I qualify?” Of course not. You have more money than charder.
“@MicheSimmons76:  soooo...who won...me...right!! Wink wink...lol...please let it be me! I never win anything :((” your streak is intact.
Contest closes at midnight PST because there are already hundreds of responses for me to look at. Now I know how to get people to respond.
“@realcharder30: @barrygreenstein 2k --&gt; charder30 on ps”. This contest is for working people, not the super wealthy.
“@badpokerpaul: @barrygreenstein Are we playing Price Is Right rules? Closest without going over??”  Nope. Just closest.
“@SuddenlyBryce:  7 small bets in the stud game at commerce”.   There is no 50-100 stud if that's what you were alluding to!
“@JoeTall:  3D printing is going to crush the overpriced auto part market.”  This part could be printed for $1.
"@ALL_IN_BROKE: @barrygreenstein  I'm guessing there is a light in the piece" just for the plastic, not for the light it covers.
50 guesses in the first ten minutes.  15 of them were some form of "three fitty." None included PokerStars ID, probably because most are US.
Closest guesser will get $25 deposited in his/her pokerstars account so include your screen name.
Guess the replacement price for that black plastic piece to the left of my license plate without labor. http://t.co/peAEyqlGGY

Flopped 10 8 7 to my J 9. Played for my 10bb vs Landfish's KJ. Turn A. Check raise by me. River Q. Out of #wsop40
Fell back under starting stack to 6500. Got reeled in by Landfish and his magical Q9o a few times. #wsop40
Early rush in #wsop40 six handed limit holdem. 300 players started with 7500. I have 13k.
RT @donkability: Just brushed up against @barrygreenstein in the hallway been running good since! ... now I know where I lost my mojo!
Out 21st. #wsop37
Couldn't beat a Jack in triple draw. Got down to 38k. Dbled back to 80k in nl holdem, JJ &gt; AQ. Still 23 left. #wsop37
Lost two pots and I'm short with 70k. If I had won them I'd be chipleader. Nathaniel took off. 23 left. Avg is 156k. #wsop37
My youngest son Nathaniel is sweating me day 3 of 8-game. Should be good luck. Actually all my kids are good luck for me. Avg chips 24 left

Late entry into #wsop37, $2500 8-game. Started with 7500 in chips. Now I have 12k.
Another second at a shootout table. Had enough luck to win it. #wsop36
Playing #wsop36 $3k no limit shootout. My table might be first to heads up. The other guy took everyone else out and has 71k to my 19k.
This time I was done in by a Jack on the river. I'm going to have to start playing better or getting luckier. Out of #wsop35
@Jamie_Manz you'll have to find me at a tournament if you want your book signed.
But I still have 10k which is around average. #wsop35
Similar to how people complain to me, I want to blame the guy who wrote the book "Ace on the Turn" because that's how I got my Kings cracked
#wsop35 $2500 mixed holdem. 350 players started with 7500. I have 8500. Not great but a better start than my last few events.
Out to a straight that hit on the river. #wsop33
Playing the 1k today. KK vs 99 for most of my chips. Another guy says he had a 9.  Flop 10 9 3. Down to 1k from 3k start. #wsop33

RT @ericrodawig:  hope you're coming back with a book for my good friend @Oscillator_WSOP #teamchips... stopped doing that end of 2011
That was hard to take. Won the blinds twice. Was shut out besides that. Already out of #wsop32 $10,000 HORSE
Another annoying exit from a good event. Final hand was a pat 10 losing to a one card draw to 8532. He hit a 4. #wsop30
Around 300 players started with 4500 in #wsop30 2-7 no limit. I have a disappointing 2700 at the first break.
@hasanhabib1  I submit the trio of Antonius, Oppenheim, and Hennigan as the best players who have not won a bracelet.
Here is the picture I sent earlier. http://t.co/ihrKPGJ7
Sorry you're not here @jonv.  http://t.co/OL419EGm
RT @clayton27: it's way more frequent than 1000:1 river being dealt up at WSOP (Probably true but over the year that's close.)
1/7000 x 1/10 (opponent calls to river) x 1/1000 (river dealt up) = 1/70,000,000. So maybe only 1 in 10 million at seven handed table.
Four card str flush about 1 in 7k, but your opponent will normally fold by then. Then dealer has to misdeal river up, completing str flush.
Hint: 7 card stud boards are normally four cards.
Something happened in HORSE event yesterday that I estimate is 100 million to 1 against. A straight flush on someone's board in 7stud.
Out on the first hand after the break. I expected this to be a good event for me but my cards had other ideas. #wsop27
Two hours. One pot. Down to 1200. 6BB #wsop27
Good start to #wsop27 #1500 HORSE. I have 7500 in chips from an initial stack of 4500.

RT @WillFalkiner: @barrygreenstein  He didnt "detail" your car, he was removing fingerprints :)
RT @JeffinPhx: V @barrygreenstein Career wise that valet has peaked, next stop mall security.
The guy detailed the car, inside also. I feel bad for him. Normal person would have dropped it off somewhere.
The perp's mother claimed he has mental issues and somewhat believes it's his car. He is now in the hospital.
The guy who took the car saw it in the valet parking lot and told the valet guy the plate and asked for the car.
the valet guy knew he had screwed up and lied about the ID and Greenstein story. He's terminated.
I just got the entire story and it's pretty bizarre.
RT @BrokeLivingJRB: My bad. I needed a pimp ride for my date(brokelivin style) and Ivey never showed up at Marriott w the Rolls
@bmeredith64 I let amnon fillipi borrow it and he topped it out at 180MPH. Anyone else would be a safer choice.
RT @buffalomyke: @barrygreenstein You at least going to bail him out? Kid had some balls, show him some love Barry.
This might make America's dumbest criminals show. He could have just asked me to borrow the car.

I think he took off before the police could detain him. Joyride or no where to fence it?
Unbelievable, but the guy dropped the car back at the mariott. He's now claiming I asked him to detail it.
RT @tiltdad: @barrygreenstein it's just a car.  ... Fortunately I know that, but as a poker player it makes you think you're running bad!

RT @MattGlantz: @barrygreenstein When they return it, they should get a signed book.
@Gamecock_Al The mariott manager said that valet parking is outsourced to a third party. I'm hope they're still liable.
I came here for the mixed game at the palomar card club. I was the big loser last night, and bigger with this.
Guy came up to valet and said his name was Greenstein. Didn't have a valet ticket. Flashed a california ID.
Olive green. License plate BG3. Stolen from mission hills (san diego) mariott.
I don't think twitter can help with this but you never know: my Aston Martin DB9 was stolen from valet parking!
@uve_been_riverd if I tell you I have aces so you fold, it's unfair to the other players in the event that I prevented you from busting.
@uve_been_riverd the main problem is unintentional collusion: comments that prevent a player from losing, costs the rest of the field equity
@SETHGBUSTBARKER if he gave info that seems like collusion, he will be penalized. (E.g.,I have the nuts, so I have to raise. Don't call.)
@lawdogusc as the final two, anything goes. You can say, "You call and it's gonna be all over baby," or even tell the opponent your hand.
@OSEEONE the tournament director can always use judgment along with the rules.  If people are colluding, then they should be penalized.
@OSEEONE the one is all in and said "fold" is in violation and will be penalized, in your example.
@grinningbuddha if only the person with the decision talks,, he doesn't change what the other player(s) do.
@TVFilmTalk if you raise on the river after disclosing your info about your hand, you would be in violation and penalized, one round off.
An example of a violation would be if I told you my hand while you were contemplating whether to call.
A player is only allowed to mention the strength or content of his hand if no other player in the hand will have a decision to make.
I think if you have last action in a poker hand you should be able to talk about it.  So the rule should be:

The flop came Ac3h2h. He checked, I bet, he called.  Turn was 10s. He checked, I bet, he raise all in.
I have been straddling and playing in the dark in the 5k PLO.  One one hand a guy limped so I couldn't raise.

After a little nap and some food, I'm ready to go for #wsop14, $3000 limit hold'em.  9k starting stack.
Decided to go all in with a flush draw and a gutshot on the flop. Two blanks and I'm out and ready for sleep.
I've played over half the hands and gotten lucky enough to go from 4500 to 9000 in chips. 180BB
@Eric_carrillo83 I don't play cash games for more than 20 hours straight. But in tournaments, I can't lose more than my buy-in.
Playing the shootout on no sleep. I plan on shooting my chips of pretty quickly or building them up. #wsop13
@Slipmaggot8 aria nightly. Take one zero off what I used to play for during the poker boom.
Still trying to decide if this will be the night to get more than 3 hours of sleep. Cash games around the clock.
Linger long but die you must. I'm out.
I'm still surviving. I have 12k, which is 8BB. Average is 42k. 144 left.
Just made a wheel with the nut flush draw and lost half my chips to rivered full house and wheel. Only 10k left.
Fizzled down the stretch to end the day with only 33k. #wsop11
I've slipped back to 44k with one hour left to go for the night. #wsop11
Still moving up. 56k at the break. Next level: 800-1600 limit.
We had about 200 entries and I'm off to a good start with 45k at the mini-dinner break. #wsop11
Up to 38k from a starting stack of 30k in #wsop11, the 10k Omaha8.
Played one orbit of the $1000 crapshoot. 3bet all in with 88. Called after long delay with QQ.  I'm out.
As expected, Jimmy "Horatio" Fricke is one of the chipleaders in the 2-7 no limit?
Struggled for hours and finally succumbed where we both paired deuces but he drew better. #wsop9
120 left. Average is 11k. I have 3300. 11BB #wsop9
145 left. Average is 8500. I have 2400. 12BB #wsop9

I wandered over to wsop9, 1500 2-7 no limit.  I am one of 250 or so players who started with 4500.
Lost half my chips with pocket kings to a set and the other half with the nut flush draw. I'm out of #wsop7
End of day 1 in #wsop7. 130 remain. Average is 57k. I have 83k.  83BB
Won a race to knock out dan kelly. Then lost a pot to david chiu. 150 left. Avg 50k. I have 88k. 110BB

249 players entered the 10k PLH. 205 are left. Avg is 37k. I have 65k. 130BB
A good climb up to 51k at the 30 minute semi-dinner break. Average is in the low thirties.
But I've increased my starting stack by 1% in the first two levels, from 30k to 30,300.
I'm at a tough table in the 10PLH. Dan Kelly on my left, then wretchy, nenad, p.jetten, and david chiu.

schemelev beat me in 140k pot then 100k pot to knock me out.

End of day 1 for event 3. 220 remain. Average is 19k. I have a healthy 46,900.
340 left. Avg 12.5k. Got down to 25k, but a lucky last hand catapulted me back to 39k.
I lost a few potsafter dinner but I won't blame it on what I ate or JonV might add something next time. 34k
@jvfricke I forgot to tell you. Everyone on the team was invited to the trailer in the parking lot for JonV's spaghetti and meatballs.
Sick rush. 500 left. Average is 8k. I have 37k at the dinner break.
@TweetJoeSparrow I've won almost every pot. You must be on an amazing rush to eclipse mine.
I think I'm the early chipleader.  I have 30k which is more than four times the average.
Up to 9600 in #wsop3.  925 total entries, a new record. Making this the first low buy-in event helped.
I have joe serock vs bobby bellande final table and bracelet bet with @boostedj. Sorry bobby.
I'm playing #wsop3, 1500 Omaha 8. Triple chips in all events, so I started with 4500. I have 7k at the first break.
Phil called me and screamed into the phone for 5 minutes, so I can't really say I talked to him about the post.
A5 &lt; 88.
Out. A5 88. Not the best way to start off the WSOP.
I'm down 102k to 48k but lucky to still be in. Earlier, he had me all in with A10 vs K6 and I hit a 6 on the river.
128 entries for #wsop2, $25k heads up. My first opponent is Benjamin Tollerene.

Event 1 of the USA COOP is tomorrow, but I didn't see it because my tourney filter screens &lt; $100.
I just signed up for all the USA COOPs on PokerStars. The first one is this Sunday. Why is it event #2?
Dwindled down and then got all in with AQ against Brett Richey's AK and got knocked out.
There are 10 players knocked out from the other three tables. None from mine. I'm down to 16k.
I have 23k from my starting stack of 25k.  No one is out at my table but Phil Laak leads with 36k.
This is being televised for ESPN to be shown in December.
Alex Keating, Brett Richey, Pat Pezzin. Darus Suharto, and Tim Begley.
I'm playing the 5K bounty shootout at Crystal Casino. My table is Bob Lauria, Daniel N, Phil Laak,
Hard to believe but I got knocked out already after getting crippled by an opponent who flopped a set.
I've got an easy tell about whether my girlfriend is staying with me: wrinkled shirt!
It's rare these days to play with satellite winners playing their first live event. NAPT Bike is such an event.
Good a big lead in the second leg. Then lost AK to A8 and eventually lost the match to bubble again.
Down 1-0. Not a good start.
I made it through the match. Next opponent is Chance Kornuth.
I thought I had the momentum, but I'm already down 2-1 in the third leg.
After being down 7-1 in the second leg, I won it to pull even in the match. Two lucky hands helped.
I'm on the other side of the luck this match. Lost a 2 outer and a 4 outer. Down 1-0 and he has a 3-1 chip edge.
My second match is against Ben Wu. He seems like a nice guy..
I won my first match 2-0. (It's best 2 out of 3.) I won the two big races we had.
I'm playing the bicycle club heads up event. My first match is against James Carroll.
The board is K-9-6-6-7. Cheong is out 3rd.  Duhamel takes a 5-1 chiplead over racener to be played Monday night.
Cheong is all in with Q-10 vs duhamel's A2.
Cheong has moved all in twice and won uncontested. He has a fighting chance to catch racener.
The board comes K-J-3-3-A and Joeseph Cheong has over 7BB.
Cheong gets his last money in with 7-3 offsuit vs K9o of duhamel.
Duhamel doesn't quite cover cheong. Cheong has 3BB left. 4 million.
The board blanks out 9-3-2-6-8.
This will go down as a very surprising play in poker history whatever happens.
Cheong 5-bet raisesall in with A7 against the big stack duhamel who calls with QQ. They are close in chips.
Duhamel takes back the chiplead. He called with AK high on the turn, then hit a king on the river. Ace high was good.
Then I can head straight to the airport and go back home to LA.
Almost everyone is hoping for a bustout so they can get some sleep. I want a few more hours of play.
Blinds are 600k-1.2 mil.  Racener still has a little play left with his 23BB.
Cheong takes over the chiplead from duhamel, 97 mil to 94 mil. Racener is a distant third with 28 mil.
Ace on the flop. Candio quickly out 4th.
Candio all in with KQdd vs Cheong's A3cc.
They're dumping out a bunch of money and claiming that it's 9 mil. Isn't it mostly ones or fake hundreds?
Apparently duhamel has 11 million more than cheong.
They're presenting Frank Kassella as wsop player of the year.  It seems to soon to walk over Grinder's carcass.
Cheong and duhamel are essentially co-leaders with around 75 million
Grinder is knocked out fifth with top pair of queens against duhamel's pocket aces.  All in on the flop.
I'll try to keep up with the action while I join the pokernews chat.
Duhamel flops a 9 to get to 50 million and send grinder down to 30 million.
Grinder moves in over the top of duhamel's open. Duhamel calls with A9o. Grinder has 33.
Actually he has around 35 million because he lost a few small pots the last round. Duhamel has under 30 mil.
He flops a Queen and doubles to around 50 million.
Racener all in with AQss vs duhamel's AK.
Just what we needed. Two drunks competing with each other for attention in different sections.
Cheong is back in the chiplead with 61 million. Grinder second with 50 million.
Racener doubles through Mizrachi with AK beating A8.  Racener back over 30mil.
Three players with good chips, Mizrachi, duhamel, and cheong.  Candio and racener still short.
Dolan got over $1.7 million for 6th. 5th pays over $2.3 million.
Dolan shoves with Q5dd in the small blind and gets called by duhamel with 44. Nothing comes. Dolan out 6th.
I meant 36 million.
The blinds are at 500k-1mil. The average stack is 3.6 million or 36BB.
For those who don't know, there is an almost live stream of the final table at espn3.com. It's delayed five minutes.
But it runs out J9 and cheong busts senti out in seventh place. It could only happen online.
Jason senti flopped trip kings on a KKQ flop.
Jason has AK vs cheong's 10 10. Cheong covers.
Yes
Still seven left. Grinder is almost to 70 mil. Duhamel has 50 mil. Racener is third with 25mil.
Back to the rio after doing the radio show. It appears I haven't missed any knockouts.
I guess stapes and I are going to fire up a pokerroad radio show on ustream right now.
90 minute dinner break. Grinder and duhamel lead with about 50 million. Cheong 3rd with 34 million.
Another important factor: grinder has been to the left of the bigger stacks and to the right of the short stacks.
Candio moved all in for 20 million over the top of two players. He showed a Seven when they folded.
Grinder picking up small pots. Experience is starting to show. That Ace on the river helped a little also.
It's starting to get crowded up here on the stage. We need another bustout to clear out a section.
RT @KrynnMaliki: @barrygreenstein But he pisses off all the dogs in the area, and bats fly into walls
One of the benefits of my advancing age is that I can no longer hear his frequency.
It has been relatively quiet around the final table but I see Mike Matusow is in his active chatting mode.
Grinder must be closing in on the chiplead after four betting against duhamel and taking a pot preflop.
On break. Duhamel with a slight lead over cheong but it's pretty flat chip counts.
Senti is all in with K7 vs cheong's A9, blind versus blind. Ace on the turn, but diamond on the river to dbl senti.
It looks like JC Tran and some of Soi Nguyen's supporters have switched over to wearing Grinder shirts.
Check that. Candio bluffs out mizrachi one the river and shows it. Then does the fillipo leap to his crowd.
It seems like racener has been pretty card dead, slowly dwindling away.  Candio has been waiting patiently also.
Dolan's father and brother invited me to sit with them. If he loses a pot I'll sit somewhere else.
Duhamel takes a pot from Cheong on the turn to close in on him for the chip lead.
Cheong makes bottom two pair against duhamel to take the chip lead.
Each time someone busts, I take over a seat from his departed section. I feel like a vulture.
Grinder busts Jarvis in a repeat of the Ivey Moneymaker hand. He has over 30 million.
Grinder racing with AQ suited against Jarvis's 99.  Grinder flops trip queens.  Turn is a Nine! Ace on the river.
Joseph cheong is in second place with 45 million. Duhamel leads with 50 million.
Joseph cheong rivers the nut flush against John dolan to take a big pot.
I stand corrected. The chipleader Duhamel doubled up Candio.
I stand correct. The chipleader Duhamel doubled up Candio.
Jack Effel is wearing a black tuxedo with a red vest.  He looks like a cross between a raven and a robin.
Fillipo doubles up with pocket Aces against Cheong's AK.  He has over 30 million now.  Third in chips.
Since Soi is out, I'm rooting for Fillipo Candio since I think he's is now the biggest underdog.
Still playing 250k-500k blinds.  Jack proudly displayed new oversized 500k chips that are now in action.
Restarting after a 40 minute break. Chips aren't much different except for Senti getting Soi's chips.
Actually Soi had the AK and Senti flopped a set of Queens.
If I'm not mistaken, all eight players remaining are under thirty years old.
The meeting was with Republican Representative John Campbell. He wants a poker-only bill.
I'm back. I missed Soi Nguyen losing a race with QQ against AK to Senti.  He's out in 9th.
I habe to take a short break to meet with Congressman John Campbell to tell him why online poker needs his help.
Soi went over to talk to his coach Nam Le. Cameras rushed over. They were speaking vietnamese. Might need subtitles.
Missed a few hands for the local fox affiliate.  This is the Superbowl. Hopefully we'll get it televised live next year.
The first big pot was won by Joseph cheong over matthew Jarvis.  Cheong raised all in on the river. 20 mil pot I think.
The first hand was won by Jarvis 27 minutes after Jack started the table introductions.
Fireworks and blasts of steam. Bruce Buffer has come and gone. Still no dealing.
Pay the over. 21 minutes is up. Jack is filling while we wait for the TV people. Bruce Buffer coming on now.
I think the Grinder got the loudest ovation. Or was that just his wife Lily?
Haven't people learned that it's dangerous to disrespect the sasquatch?
Despite my disappointment at being put in the VIP area, I am here with the Jack Links Sasquatch.
Each "sign" girl is standing by the side of the table still holding her sign. None of them look Asian to me.
They have girls holding seat numbers over their heads as they walk the players to their seats one at a time.
Over/under from when he starts talking until the first card is 20 minutes.
Jack Effel with the introductions. He really does show some enthusiasm. Over
I just got kicked back to the VIP area. The only guaranteed seats are at the final table. I should secure one next year.
The calm before the storm. The players were just taken off the stage so they can properly be introduced.
Four of the nine players are wearing hooded sweatshirts.  That wouldn't be my choice in final table apparel.
I already got kissed by two beautiful Asian women: Katrina Jett and a media girl. That's always good luck.
I'm initially rooting for Soi Nguyen because he's the biggest underdog.
Now I'm in the front row, but I think I'm in someone else's seat. Eat your heart out Bob Uecker. "He missed the flop."
I'm waiting at the in some VIP area near the stage because they don't have as much seating as last year.
I'll tweet from the wsop final table tomorrow. Join the thread in live tournaments forum at pokerroad.com.
@RealThuyDoan you can always post your videos on pokerroad.

Pokerstars @wcoop events keep missing their guarantees, which means lots of free money in overlays.

I put up a new Play by Play feature on pokerroad.com: voiceover on some TV hands. Feedback please.
Especially if we keep the trend of online qualifying for live tournaments. Online produces new players.
We can't accurately measure the effect online poker has on the land based casinos, but I think it has been positive.
They certainly had no qualms with my statement that they were just trying to protect their business interests.
But they seemed ok if regulators will be as strict with shareholders of online casinos as with them.
Commerce Casino management feels they are being unfairly singled out as the bad guys. Many CA casinos are against online.
Hasn't congress worked out that the opposition to online poker is always backed by competing gambling interests?
People are upset that the commerce casino had a representative testify against online poker.

I'm not sure if better late than never applies here, but snoop dogg finally showed up a little after 12:30.
I wonder if snoop is going to dog this. He still hasn't shown up and the party is supposed to end in 40 minutes.
It's tough when drunk people want to converse with you when you're totally sober.
I'm at the PokerStars party waiting for Snoop Dogg.  I just remembered the only drawback to not drinking.

There is an $11 bounty tournament on pokerstars at 16:00 EST tomorrow. Knock me out for $500 bounty.
I had the best hand most of the match.  But it still took to the fifth level for me to win.  Sammy next.
Vanessa tripped an hour ago and badly sprained her ankle.  Jeff Gillooley didn't charge me too much.
Antonio and Sammy have been chosen for the feature table. A good choice for sure.
Hoping to avoid being the feature match, but Vanessa represents the sponsor. It can change the way she plays.
I play at around 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon, the second bracket in action.
That last tweet was a text to Phil obv!
ey announce it.
You play Gavin Smith in your first match. Plays a lot of small ball, limping style, which plays right into your strength. I'll tell you  ...
If I beat her, I'll play the winner of Sammy Farha vs Antonio Esfandiari.
I got a pretty tough draw in Vanessa Rousso. We played in this two years ago and I beat her, but I didn't outplay her.
Waiting to get into Pure nightclub for the bracket drawing for the NBC Heads Up.

Apologies to any female friends who have had to put up with my snoring.  Three hours of sleep for me.

Out with QQ in a nice pot. Lost all in on a flop of 653 to 22.  Deuce on the river.
That makes the tournament more relaxing, but I am a little hungry.
At least I won enough during the dinner break to cover my buy-in and a little more.
Dinner break. 200 left.  I have 18k, which is a little over average.  We got 3k for each rebuy and 6k for the add-on.
The $1,000,000 guarantee wasn't met in this event so the Commerce had to add $86,000 to the prizepool.
1k with rebuys. I came in an hour late. Rebought immediately. Rebought again and added on. 4k total.
A definite improvement in the commerce tournament hotdogs. I made it halfway through this time.
@GambitDZ I don't like the sound of that. Please don't desert me!
Matt Savage told me they did away with the one-bite-throw-away hotdogs at commerce. About to test it out.

Lost an 80k race and another big pot.  Now I'm the shortest stack with 30k. 68 left.
The KK was the short stack but flopped a King. A noise inducing Ace in the river to burst the bubble.
It looked like Marsha Waggoner was going to bubble with only enough chips for a couple hands. Then AA vs KK.
73 left. Playing hand-for-hand. Average is 205k. I have 100k.  Not expecting the double bubble.

I won only one small pot that level. 200 left. Avg 75k. I have 110k. Would like to get to at least 200 by end of day.

3 way pot. flop Jd4d4s. I had Ad8d. Bet and raise to me. Knew I was against AJ, but moved in anyway.
We're restarting now in Melbourne.  294 players left out of the total field of 746. Avg 51k.  I have 74k.
Out on the bubble with Q10 vs KK to the same guy who beat my pocket kings.
The other time I played this event I went out on the bubble with QQ vs 1010.  These $100,000 bubbles add up.
I was the chipleader, but then I went all in with KK vs JJ and lost. 50k left with 6 left. Bubble likely.

If you sign up for tourney,  reply to me and I will respond. Lauren @ pokerstars, I will give the count.
$1000 split for players who outlast all PS pros. I have a bet that at least 3 people will sign because of my tweet.
I just signed up for an $11 "Outlast the Pros" tourney on PokerStars. It starts in 2 hours at 20:00 ET.
Out with 70 left.
Terrible level culminated by losing a 280k pot with a missed straight draw. Down to 45k, 11 big blinds. 85 left.

Happiness is flopping top set, getting good action and winning the pot. Happened twice to get me to 210k.
180 left. Average is 110k. I was over average briefly, but now I'm back down to 100k.
The total entries is 322. 193 are left. Average is 100k. I'm not there yet, but I'm up to 84k.
49k after level 6. Avg 80k. Devilfish was right. I can't look much worse than usual with my head shaved.
16 people got their heads shaved by Johnnie and Jason and then Thuy shaved Johnnie the barber.
I guess I'm going to get my head shaved tonight with whoever will join me in solidarity for Thuy Doan.

Bellagio Five Diamond $15,000 Main Event.  Started with 60k in chips. I have 55k after the first level.
Funny tweet after you get off the phone with me. You mean "rest the phone while you wait for your dad to stop talking so you can get to  ...
Out. Probably bad karma from forgetting to bring a PokerStars patch. Didn't know I was going to play.
After level 4, I'm down to 6k here at the Commerce, after starting with 10k. Get the mixed game going downstairs.
I used the food coupon for a hot dog, chips, and soda. It was one of those one-bite-and-into-the-trash hot dogs.
Paul "Eskimo" Clark is alive and well and just offered me 2/3 if I stake him. I passed on that incredible deal.
No big cash game at the commerce, so I'm playing the $2,000 main event at their fall tournament.
Sitting down for High Stakes Poker against Phillips, Dwan, Ivey, Robl, Antonius, Negreanu, and Veldhuis.
Joe moves in with 99. Darvin calls with QJdd.  150 mil pot. Board 872 K 7 and Joe wins the main event.
They have played over 80 hands and had 5 or 6 all-ins, one called.  This has gone way longer than I expected.
Board was 10 5 9 10 3. Joe had J9. Darvin 8 7.  Joe leads with 109 mil to 86 mil.
Darvin moves in with a straight draw with one to come and gets called by second pair. Joe doubles up.
Moon strikes back on a board of 10-9-8-K, betting 15 mil which got Joe to fold on the turn.  137 to 58.
Cada 4-bets all in and Darvin folds. Another 8 million back to Joe Cada.
Cada just rivered a straight to get 12 million back, but he's still behind 130 to 65.
Cada keeps trying to outplay Darvin instead of a basic solid game. It may be his demise as he bluffs off some more.
Darvin has won four straight decent pot, increasing his lead.  Joe is definitely feeling the pressure.
Big pot won by Darvin with, what else, third pair.  He's got the lead.
Every time Cada loses a big pot, a supporter behind him says, "You got this Joe." Isn't his timing off?
The betting preflop: 3 million by Moon, 10 million by Cada, 25 million by Moon. Cada folds. Back to even.
Someone just asked if Joe Sebok was my son. I asked why. She said he was a great guy. I said, Then he's my son.
Darvin has fought back to almost 90 million.  Not that far behind. There are 195 million chips in play.
There is no doubt that if they both flop top pair or better, they will get all in for 80 big blinds.
I wish I didn't know that Phil bet that he would win against Darvin winning. It's hard not to like Darvin.
Now Laura Lane from Inside Deal on epsn.com is talking to Stapes to add to his strikeout total.
Linda Tran is the current dealer and she is beautiful and Asian. More incentive for me to final table next year.
Darvin raise-bluffed on the river and Joe called with second pair to take a 129 to 66 chiplead.
Joe bet 3 mil on the flop with only King high and got called by Queen high. Maybe he bet for value!
Moon three-bet three hands preflop to get back to about 85 mil vs 110 mil for Cada.
Stapleton hitting on the most attractive women on the stage. He has a low batting avg, but the most at-bats.
Huge pot, won by Cada.  Almost back to where we started.  35 mil bet on river, not called by Darvin.
Some guys were asked to put their Cada shirts back on. Thankfully, we haven't had any mooning from the opposition.
I think Darvin Moon has the chiplead after about 10 hands.
Cada flopped the nut flush and played it slow. It look like he could have made more since Darvin easily called.
Darvin wins another big pot. He's almost gotten even with Cada.
We just broke the most users on the pokerroadforums.com record. We forgot to link to the threads Saturday.
Darvin wins a 50 mil with QQ vs 99 on a board of K32AK. If he played it preflop he might have doubled up.
Big pot first hand. This could be it.
I guess I missed it. The guy sang shuffle up and deal.
Motley Crew singer will say shuffle up and deal, but he has some things to say first!
Will Jack Effel's intro speech take longer than the heads up play?  He just introduced the Sasquatch.
Jill Russin wouldn't let me stop kissing her for the cameras so I told her let's get a room, and she's not even Asian.
I gave an over/under of 28 hands for the media.
Joy Miller asked if I would do commentary if it went longer than expect. I said, "Don't worry. It will be a quickie"
Its a bigger zoo here than I would have expected. Don't they know it's going to be over quickly?
Antoine all in, 88 vs Joe's AK. Board: 545 10 K, knocking out Saout. Resume play Monday. Cada 136m Darvin 62m.
Joe Cada moves in with 22 and gets called by Saout who has QQ. Board: 972 3 6, doubling into the chiplead.
Eric all in again with A5cc vs Darvin's KJdd. Board is Qc 9h 2c Kh 4h, eliminating Eric in 4th place.
Eric is all in with K 10 vs Darvin's A7.  The board is K 9 5 K Q, doubling Eric to over 20 million.
Eric has under 10 million, Antoine has 90 million. Darvin has 56 million, Joe has 43 million.
All in! Eric with AQ. Antoine has AK. One will have a 2 to 1 chiplead. The other out or crippled. Board: K 10 7 K 6.
All four players are near the average of 50 million, which is 50 big blinds. This will outlast my battery.
Buchman and Saout get into a raising war on a 10-3-2 flop. Buchman wins a huge pot to take the chip lead.
Jeff is all in with pockets sevens against Antoine's A9. The board comes 10 9 6 Q 4. Jeff is out in 5th.
Actually Shulman is down to 7 big blinds. Saout leads with 75 big blinds.
Break. Anyone's game. Shulman is the shortest. Low battery of course.
Antoine has KQ against Jeff's A5. Jeff is all in for over 5 million.  Jeff flops an ace and doubles to 11 million.
Darvin slips up again by going all in with K9 offsuit and gets called by Cada's Aces. Cada might be chipleader.
All in.  Jacks for Shulman, Threes for Cada. Cada flops a three to double up and cripple Shulman.
Darvin AQ, Begleiter all in with QQ.  Darvin spikes a magical Ace on the river to regain the chip lead. Begs out 6th.
For the pokerroad faithful, Phil just seventhbok'd, of course.
Phil gets all in with AK against Darvin's AQ. Queen on the flop and Phil is out in seventh, unluckily.
On break. Still an hour left at 300k-600k.  Phil has 6.5 million.
All in Buchman against Cada.  Both have AK suited. Buchman picks up a flush draw on the turn but misses. Chopped pot.
Phil is dying a slow death. Down to 11 big blinds.  He needs to pick up a good hand and double up.
Strange call by Begs. He was a solid underdog to two overs and a flush draw. Saout is the new chip leader.
Saout moves in post flop with AKhh on a two heart board. Begleiter calls with second pair. Heart on turn.
Joe cada checked top pair twice against Phil until he bet at Joe on the river. Phil down to 8m. Blinds 300k-600k.
Cada moves all in on Phil with 44. Phil takes a long time to call with A8ss. Phil loses the race. Phil down to 10m.
Cada doubles up his short stack through Buchman, J4 versus 54.
Jeff doubles to 12 million through Joe Cada with AK against AJ, avoiding Joe's straight draw on the turn.
@espn_poker. I don't think they've converted t-chips to dollars.  Maybe to dollars divided by three, in some sense.
I also think you can find these tweets  and more @pokerstars and @pokerroadnation.
I assume all of you know it, but my tweets and other issues are being discussed in the forums at pokerroad.com.
Jeff is the shortest stack with 13 big blinds.  Phil has 30 big blinds.  The chipleader has 110 big blinds.
I came back late and my seat had been taken. I'm no longer with team Ivey. Maybe seats will open with the next bustout.
Great speech by Mike Sexton, as usual, but I wasn't sure if he would finish in time for the Main Event to resume.
Rousing speeches by Doyle, TJ, and Tom Sexton presenting Mike. It was so sugary, I thought he had died!
I'm at Mike Sexton's VIP dinner. Joe Stapleton found out the food is free. His pockets are full and Scott is helping.
Two hour dinner break. Phil is in fifth with 16 million.  Buchman leads with 54 million. Shulman is last.
Phil wins 3 million from Begleiter after betting the river and not getting a call.
Phil and Jeff Shulman are the short stacks with around 10 million. Average is almost 30 million.
Phil is the clear short stack with 20 big blinds, but just picked up over a million against Jeff Shulman.
Darvin and Begs play a huge pot.  Begs wins with a reraise and Moon may have lost the chiplead to Buchman.
Phil and Joe Cada are the two short stacks with under ten million. Still seven left.  Darvin leads. Buchman second.
Jonathan finally gave out all the pokerroad swag. We fitted most of Phil's section. Not sure if they will get on camera.
Buchman KK against Schaffel's AA, all in preflop. Buchman busts him with a King on the flop, and Quads on the turn.
Akenhead out in 9th. 33 loses to 99 of Schaffel.
Schaffel doubles through Akenhead AA vs KK to cripple him back to shortest stack.
Cada tried to raise bluff Darvin on the river, unsuccessfully. Darvin back on his feet. Cada short stack in trouble.
Coloring up for the next level: 200k-400k, 50k ante. Phil is in eighth place with 11 million. Schaffel last.
Darvin bluffs all in against antoine's jacks and deuces on the flop and doubles him up. He should raised him preflop.
Unbelievable Queen on the river for akenhead to triple up to nearly fourth in chips.
Akenhead all in and called by begleiter. Buchman thinking. Then reraises with obvious big hand.
Long break.  Three big stacks, Moon, Buchman, Begleiter. Six low stacks, lowest is Akenhead's 3.5 million.
First break. It felt like the first round of a boxing match where there was more feeling out than punches thrown.
We finally see our first turn card and our first river. Buchman beats Schulman in a checked down pot.
Joe Cada has opened the most hands and has been reraised three or four times, and has folded every time.
Melissa's funny observation: Phil Ivey's family is off limits to cameramen, yet they are wearing Full Tilt logos.
It took about two rounds until Phil won his first pot. Then he moved all-in against Shulman two hands later, and won.
Ivey plays his first pot, calling a raise from Joe Cada and folding to a bet on the flop.
Darvin Moon three bets Akenhead's under-the-gun raise and takes it down.
After six raise-and-take-it's, the limit is increased to 150k-300k with 40k ante.  Schaffel wins with a bet on the flop.
Jeff Shulman raised from the cutoff and won the first hand, stealing Phil Ivey's big blind.
Those betting the over on the start time probably won.  The first hand was dealt at 12:59, as Doyle says shuffle up.
I'm sitting next to @melissalvla who is suggesting mean and cynical tweets. You'll just have to follow her if you're demented.
They announced the size of each rooting section that each player brought. By far the smallest: Phil Ivey.
Introducing the players.  Surprisingly, Darvin Moon brought 100 friend and relatives to cheer him on.
Competitive screaming from the various rooting sections. Joe Cada's group wins that competition.
National Anthem for Barry Shulman. Military presenting arms. Lame recording. Needed a real band or singer.
Back handed compliment when Jeffrey introduced Barry Shulman, WSOPE winner, and said. "Anyone can win."
Opening announcements; Jack Effel's wedding anniversary and a moment of silence for Hans "Tuna" Lund.
The Humpreys are in the first row on the stage. Phil's family and I only qualified for third row seating.
First order of business. Mel Humphrey wouldn't take off his Ivey tee shirt, but Pat put on a PokerRoad hoodie.
Commence WSOP Main Event tweeting. Jeffrey Pollack gave me the OK to tweet as often as I want.
I'll be tweeting updates from the Main Event final table. They'll be compiled in the Red Pro Forum at pokerroad.com.

Nelly was rockin', or is it rappin', but the only part of his lyrics I could decipher was, "Put your hands up."
Scantily clad girls dancing for hours. Am I getting old because I was very impressed with their athletic ability but didn't think about  ...
Pokerstars does put on a great party. Make sure to qualify online there for next year's Main Event so you can see what I mean.
