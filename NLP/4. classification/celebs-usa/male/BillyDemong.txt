New @Strava pet peeve, people log a bike ride under running.  1:26 mile? I mean c'mon.
Great Provis jump @TFletchernordic @SkiFletch !
@CalebTurner17 that being said all good cyclists I know are hammers at Nordic after a season or 2
@CalebTurner17 I would say it takes longer to get proficient with xc technique than going the other way.
@nordictrecker @kikkanimal @dophed @sadzarue where are you watching this?
@CalebTurner17 for fun fitness or competition?
Trying to get fit! http://t.co/BvC6Ezjp7O #strava

Almost home! http://t.co/dx6b176hBO
Journey home begun. Quick trip but some fun racing in Norway! 6 days door to door.
@KristianBuvarp ask @jdjarrett1970
@KristianBuvarp @_Holmenkollen @TFletchernordic Maybe?!
@lsasfan perhaps!
In unofficial (cuz I was scared) time bet w @TFletchernordic we were within .7s for all '14 races except 2nd Oly indiv w that he wins by 52!
Ok @_Holmenkollen s a wrap! Good jump from @TFletchernordic &amp; Im satisfied w' my race but ready to get home! Better not oversleep my flight.
Nice work by @Lowellcbailey &amp; @tb_burke finishing 10&amp;13 for @USBiathlon @biathlonworld cup in Pokljuka!
Can't wait to watch @CitiEveryStep All-star @RicoSled23 tear it up @Sochi2014 sled hockey! Opening ceremonies in progress.
Hmmm... Will we be jumping tonight @_Holmenkollen or will we be Wiki racing?!
@lindseyvan have fun! But not too much... No @jessicajerome
Flying 2 @_Holmenkollen now but don't worry stayed awake and now safely onboard!
@jdjarrett1970 if @tfletchernordic pulled off a negative split the next step is to make the last lap the fastest! #playercoach ;)
@jdjarrett1970 @TFletchernordic @_Holmenkollen @SkiFletch @nick_hendrickso The real question is do I owe Taylor a 5 spot?!
Nordic Combined fun! Jumped ok to 20th place. Skied w @BKircheisen (thx buddy!) to fight for podium w15 guys on the last lap! Tot reshuffle!
Luckily there is a universal cure for jetlag http://t.co/xx5fN4jgh9

Well at least I got my ride in! Thanks @Motorad666 n @johnmckone http://t.co/gaHi6iQY6s
Weather says 50 and sunny. What to do... Maybe surf and turf? Ski this morning and ride this afternoon?
@alanabrahamson can I go as your assistant?
Seems like not too long ago that @JohnnySpillane and I flew home with the @Olympics flag from Nagano to Salt Lake.
@Viper2dot0 I was close when I couldn't find the pot pies.

Kinda strange to wake up in my own bed and tear up the grocery store with Liam at 7:30 this morning!
@andrew_gardner I've got a three year old who's 23 hrs deep in this travel day. Thankful for iPad right now!
@andrew_gardner anything would be sweeter than what I meant. #snafu

Of course my family shows up and the sunshine goes away for the first time @sochi2014

First morning back in PC. Feeling good, weather looks sweet, what are we going to do today?!
Pretty sweet video of the start of the Engadine marathon http://t.co/mitmcmN4 @FastBigDog
@FastBigDog question: what is the significance of 2250? A: the amount of $ spent on engadine. Or B: your overall placing
First snafu of the assault on the Engadine... @FastBigDog has a ticket for tomorrows flight.
thanks for an amazing season everyone! @SkiFletch @tfletchernordic @CoachGilbo @johnnyspillane @jdjarrett1970 tusen takk!
Holy cow! @SkiFletch wins the holmenkollen!!! Way to hang in there and have your first podium be the biggest world cup you can win!!!

@sylvanellefson @AndyNewellskier Are you Oslo bound?  Or Drammen?  Where you staying?
@FastBigDog  @jessicajerome @TFletchernordic stop demeaning florida.
Awesome job today @SkiFletch! Big congrats to @TinoEdelmann and Johannes and hats off to hot shot @jan_schmid  for the victory in Lahti!
@IanMacGregory Did you get my email?  I'd try again but since you did not write back I'm assuming twitter must be the only option.
My friend just complained their iphone won't sync with their new $45k car... #firstworldproblems
@TFletchernordic get me a pair!
@SkiFletch @TFletchernordic @nick_hendrickso @brettdenney 2 bad bout comp today but look forward 2 getting up early again to watch tomorrow!

Super happy to b home with my family but missing my team... hope @TFletchernordic @SkiFletch @nick_hendrickso @brettdenney kill it in Lahti!
If there is one thing I am envious of @TFletchernordic it's his ability to sleep long drives away.
Happy mardi gras to the birthday boy @coachgilbo http://t.co/n0WTxiGT
@TFletchernordic @FastBigDog thanks for your honesty Tay, gr8 to have humble teammates like u. This bet def puts new slant on 10 takes team.
As predicted by oracles of repute, like @FastBigDog, I have successfully buried @TFletchernordic by 12.8 seconds for overall season lead.
@TFletchernordic u neglected to mention how you caught 34 seconds on me and then lost 13.1 on last lap. A trend that will continue today.
Hope @AlePittin is ok! Let us know when you are feeling better.
Road warrior again. Intervals with @PaulClarkPC in the am. Munich bound in the pm. Race in Klingenthal on saturday!

Great party celebrating the new @lululemon store opening in Trolley Sq, slc.

"@jdjarrett1970: Nice work @jmjarrett2002 and @BillyDemong NC kicking but in classic racing!" You too, way to rock the masters!

Rough night. Fever and not holding food down. Bummed I'm going to miss the Super Q

25-30 kmskate pulling chariot with a 1 yr old and being herded by a border collie = hard without!!!
@TFletchernordic @PaulClarkPC @toddhageman absolutely not. You wussied out of 5 world cups this year so I'm actually ahead by 5 min.
@nick_hendrickso heard u got stabbed in da race?! Blood trail to the lodge, you ok? was probably @FastBigDog heard he's a dirty double poler
@PaulClarkPC @toddhageman @TFletchernordic Had a stellar pool party. Did any of you win the race? Bummed I missed it... but not too much
So far I'm disappointed with the "big storm" we were forecasted.  Hoping the next few days errs in the other direction.
@USANAinc thanks for your support of @usskiteam and http://t.co/XixZdtIa Young guys r killing it this season and on the road with your help!

@timjohnsoncx give lynn a big congrats for me!
Looking forward to a time when I will ride my bike and ski more miles than I fly.
@roncjudd true! yet the flipside $25 burger in the usa would entail a minimum of 4 patties and a stack of cheese. Good after a 10km though.
This is what a $25 burger looks like in switzerland. http://t.co/huizflKv
So close! In podium contention til the end but got worked by @MikkoKokslien and finished 6. @AlePittin win in huge solo style! #bigcahones
Decent day in Chaux Neuve. Made it up to 3 or so for a sec but effort to get up was costly and finished 12th. Congrats again to @AlePittin!
Hard new track in Chaux Neuve today! Gr8 jumping by @SkiFletch and whole team. Congrats to @AlePittin on his 1st WC victory!

Dumping snow in oberstdorf, nice change. @JohnnySpillane and @SkiFletch had great provisional jumps. Team event tomorrow
Made it to Oberstdorf on last possible train. Slept 6 hours and then spent last 30 min pushing vans through the snow. On our way now though!
"@Emma_Garrard: @toddhageman had a full class tonite but why were half of them wearing headphones?" thats not cool.
Currently sitting at the San Francisco Coffee company in Pasing Germany watching bums fight on the street outside the Bahnhof.

Jonesing in Kuusamo, xc course is almost there, jump on the cusp but nothing quite ready.  Forecast looks manageably warm.

@JimMillerUSAC I've never in my life used this term before but it seems appropriate... LOL!!!
@JimMillerUSAC at what point do my shenanigans indicate that I am a master blaster?
@JimMillerUSAC this is true! I'm thinking I should do a cross race this weekend or maybe running to keep it going
Just rode about 20 miles on dirt and pave bike paths pulling the chariot... Why am I so fried?! @PCpoint2point

Nice Racin boys! 3 in the top 30 in Obertsdorf. @BFletcher2010 19th (35/14) @JohnnySpillane 23rd (41/13) @TFletchernordic 29th (52/3)
@FastBigDog are u in BC? Those trails look nasty too!
@BFletcher2010 @toddhageman really far back me 8:17 but beat the 1st girl by 1min.  Todd was maybe 20 min behind me.
Since I'm not a good enough mechanic to close a skewer i had to stop and close it 4 times, when I finally fixed it I got stung in the face
Made it home after finishing @pcpoint2point and absolutely worked. I can see why people call leadville a road race! @Jride13 you are sick ;)
There is only one potential problem for the Park City P2P this morning... I can't get the ice off my windshield.
Good chilly morning to be back in the Utah hood.  If its this cold for the PCP2P tomorrow I'm going to need to shed some layers somewhere!

@BFletcher2010 this is true, you logged extra k's today.
Guarantee I would hate it if I had to do more than 1or2 penalty laps. Definetly favors the jumpers
1st podium since oly games at the SGP today. 3rd in the innaugural NC Penalty race, hated the idea before I did it, now biased.
Cold snap. Just in time for 1st SGP comp in Oberwiesenthal went from sauna to hoodie weather! Time to put on some @Smartwool and giv'er!

Back at Hotel comfy in bed watching TDF!
Just had an epic fail... Rode from Courchevel over Madeleine and bailed at the bottom of Telegraph after freezing butts off in St Jean
@Cloxxki it would have to b steeper than paltry 7-8% to have chance at all 16% or more, classic would be fastest for sure on a long climb
@Cloxxki meaning duncan douglas
@Cloxxki classic? I think might be faster... Dunno maybe 75-80min for great skier
Hard little TT up L'Alpe d'Duez today. 48:15 not sure if that's my PR or not but it def would not play on friday!
