After 10 games my Lions r 7-3. With 6 games left my prediction of a 10 game season is looking really good.
Watch 2 great college football games, both winning quarterbacks gave praises 2 God. Dont really hear that from athletes anymore. #respect
Because 1st time is a skim thru listen to beats, then the rest of the day is listening to lyrics. Def will b bumping Wale all day 2morrow.
Hearing a lot about Wale new joint. Got that today too but haven't got to it. Any album I buy I def have to listen to it a whole day.
Jus got that new Drake, maybe 2 suspect songs but probably best album this year. What y'all think?
Prayers go out to the families of the Oklahoma State Women's basketball team who lost their head & assistant coach in a plane crash.
Thanks again for listening. Now back to twitter hibernation.
Affected by this & we feel 4 them because a lot of them depend on these jobs, but we didn't go on strike we were lock us out. Big difference
Where ever we want to jus like owners have the right to trade us without informing us. And 2 we know all the game day workers that are
Keep hearing people saying blame the Melo's & Lebron's for forming super teams. Thats y we in a lockout. Which is not true we should have
I know I said I was going into hibernation but jus read about 700 tweets. 2 things I like to address b4 I'm done talking about this. One....
Sorry for blowing up y'all time line, jus a little frustrated. I'll go back into twitter hibernation.
Giving back 7% (350 million a yr). After all that we jus want @ least the system rules have to favor for us. Do is that still being greedy?
Apologizes to all the fans out there, but I feel like I had to state our case because we are being perceived by the owners as greedy after
Play, but like I said we owe this to the players from 99 and future players. In my opinion its a slap in the face to both. Once again I
Even when we agree with a 50/50 split the system was so terrible that their wouldn't be any player movement. Don't get me wrong I want to
And I understand that both the NBA & NBPA are alienating the fans and as a player we r sorry for that, but we have to stand up 4 a fair deal
To the players from the 99 lockout because THEY sacrifice for US, which we benefited off and we need to do that for future players to come.
The owners who r being greedy by not negotiating fair on the BRI & system issues get called businessmen. We the current players owe this....
Lot of u guys saying we are being greedy. Fact is its a business and like it or not basketball players r businessmen. It's funny that...
Read someone tweet saying Orlando Magic players wants 2 accept the deal. It doesn't speak for all of us I dont agree with accepting the deal

Finally after reading all 1,485 tweets about my Andrew Bynum tweet, had some good responsive n some terrible ones. But in the end everyone
My argument is not about if he was wrong or not, it's about the punishment. I WILL REPEAT THIS 4 3rd X, HE WAS WRONG! Is that clear enough?
RT @Glenjr88: @jrich23 this isn't the 80's though. Should have been 10 games. (true but the players of the 80s made the game popular today)
RT @59Spartan: @jrich23 disagree on that. They need 2 send a message. 25k is nothing 2 him  (no matter how much he makes it's still 25k)
I REPEAT HE WAS WRONG! but not 5 games wrong. Maybe a big fine but not games missed.
Wow! I guess everybody that responded 2 my last tweet is under the age of 21. Do anybody remember the NBA in the 80s?
Damn 5 game suspension + 25k  for Andrew Bynum is crazy. His foul was totally wrong but not worth that severe of a punishment.
This game could of been over in regulation if KD had the ball. Hats off to the Grizz for playing hard.
Can someone call Buffalo Wild Wings, don't want this game to end lol.
Damn is KD on OKC team anymore? Clutch time and ball is not in his hands?
