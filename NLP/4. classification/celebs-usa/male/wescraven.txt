(con't RE Scream TV series) If they have a great script/concept, it could be fun. If not, not.
A lot of you have asked about the Scream TV series. It's true I've been approached. My response was, it would depend on the script.
#ThingsNotToDoOnAFirstDate A chick flick. Take her to a scary one, see what she's made of. Unless she has long fingernails, then watch out.

No, he didn't open them - he blew them off their hinges. He was uniquely qualified for that because he was a little unhinged himself.
Jonathan Winters died today. He was my first comic hero in HS + college - a guy so dangerously funny he opened the doors to modern comedy.

My thoughts are with Roger Ebert's family. He was one of the greats and will be dearly missed.
Roger Ebert gave my first film, Last House on the Left, its only positive review. Everyone else reviled it, but he saw merit in it.

@Awe3 I started at 31 so it's not impossible. Just make money for somebody and you'll work again!
@adudeinaz I don't think so. She was still moving when we cut away from her...
@WackyBasith The camera's Panavision 35mm. And all the lenses for the SCREAM series are anamorphic. They gives the "big screen" look.
@rikoconel Que tal?
@MlRANDALEIGH Anybody on a ladder
@ademori I think she should turn out to be Ghost Face. Just kidding.
@PatrickKeown I'm sure it was a Communist plot.
@_Silvey_ Didn't go to see it. Grrr.
@kingtonseth Yes.
@Drea_AM Being forbidden to see them as a kid helped, I'm sure. Also, when I did start watching them, I just fell in love with them. Magic!
@WanielDalker It was Bob Weinstein's call. Since it involved Sid and her friends, Bob was worried that it wouldn't grab a young audience.
@ILNY83 Hire all first-time actors, shoot it on iPhone in one room and hire someone cheaper than me to direct.
@Mattfittes I'm proud of almost all of them, just because they got done. But, LHL, HHE, NOES, PUTS, MOTH, and SCREAM, I guess.
@ottawasearching That's right. Many years later I watched a documentary about the phenomenum - it's real in one specific area of Asia.
@MlRANDALEIGH Unfortunately I had to sell the rights to the story back in '84 in order to get the film made. So, I have no control over it.
@OmgRC18IzSwagg Just do it. Do something original. Get the very best actors you possibly can.
@ademori I do too. We're great admirers of each others work.
@TheErikFox It was a last-minute replacement for the original one Kevin wrote. I think he knocked it off in a weekend!
@MauricioGomez_ No, haven't talked to her. But she was really nice to work with and very dedicated.
@jacki1991 We loved Ann Arbor.
Thanks!  This has been a lot of fun we will do it again soon.
@LizaCollins9 - Yes, People Under The Stairs, Nightmare and Hills Have Eyes were all based on real stories.
@LindaSilja - I would like to do a Broadway show version of Elm Street.
@NialPerry918 - I wouldn't mind producing a remake of Shocker.  The basic concept could be expanded and it could use some new special FX
@MarinaFromMars - Fitting 50 pounds of you know what in a 5 pound bag.  The clock is my enemy....
@TheErikFox - It took about a year and a half to write Nightmare.
@ChrisHernandz Favorite scene to shoot Scream 4: Emma Roberts beating the shit out of herself.  She was amazing and so was the stunt woman
@IrenePacx - The script was already written.  I didn't want an entire rewrite while we were shooting :)
@hattyjay - After the original, I would say Nightmare 3 and Nightmare 7 of course :)
@CraigKocher - The list is too long.
@TheErikFox - Right now... comedy.
@benmckk - 11 weeks!!!
Subzero_One No, but I do appearances when I can.  I just did a lecture/Q&A at NYU Film School.  It was lots of fun.
@Lostboy1982 Only with Robert Englund playing the role
@joshbtaylor Eraserhead, When a Stranger Calls, The Hitchhiker all started out as low budget shorts.
@joshbtaylor Step 1 - Make a really great short film.  Step 2 - Move to Los Angeles.
@DLo86 - Quentin Tarantino told me we should have killed everyone and let Jill get away with it in @Scream4. Bob Weinstein wouldn't have it.
@Utica84 We had two scripts written but were never satisfied with either.  The studio sort of let it fizzle.  I still would love to do it.
@jacki1991 I have been doing it my whole life.  One of my parent's friends was a naturalist and made me aware of the world of nature.
@gakirules Freddy.  Because he talks and he is funny.
@MauricioGomez_ The Night of the Living Republicans
@MauricioGomez_ Is there anything with Republicans in it...
@Buster815 - Only if the birds won.. Or we could do a movie called The People...
@AdamShiels - But there's never been a film like it :)
@AdamShiels - No.  The first time the studio saw it they though it would never make a penny. I was never so sure they weren't right.
@muerte_amor And that was the entire original costume, by the way.
@muetre_amor I was pretty leery... didn't want to do something silly in the middle of a scary scene.  But it seemed to get by okay.
@Lunachique - If the parents haven't burned me at the stake...
@Lunachique - I'm working on book called a Child's Book of Nightmares.  Maybe once it's out we'll make a movie.
@EvaDestructi0n The first thing that comes to mind is JAWS which was a fantastic score for a fantastic movie.
@JackAllenOnline - "Who is your favorite director?"
@mddeese It's like flying a 747 - no, 50 747s at the same time.  I love it.
@DebbieWilkins1 - Very hands on.  I have a long relationship with Marco Beltrami.  I am 100% part of the creative project & love new bands
@Bertha_Leal  Being back and working with all the people I love to work with
@BittrScrptReadr Yes it did.  I would love to do any of those things.  Are you the head of a studio?  Send me a script!
@MauricioGomez_ My cat Cinnamon
@Califdream_1 - We are working on a secret project in the graphic novel world...  Don't have clearance to discuss quite yet.

Don't miss: MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, with stunning Elizabeth Olsen and very creepy John Hawkes.
Also: IDES OF MARCH, starring George Clooney and Ryan Gosling - Gosling is much stronger in DRIVE, but he's okay here too :)
Other new movies I rec: THE GUARD, starring Brendan Gleeson & Don Cheadle (also check out Gleeson in SEXY BEAST or THE PROPOSTION)
