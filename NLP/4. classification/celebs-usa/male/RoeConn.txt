Sorry debate ended before Martha Raddatz could get in a question about Lindsay Lohan's 911 call.
Twitter is kinda predictable.  Left says Biden won.  Right says Ryan won. Everyone else took pictures of their dessert.
If Ryan is REALLY Biden's friend, Joe should offer him a ride home.
Biden going from giddy to belligerent.  Been there.

Speaking of healthcare, has anyone checked to see if Jim Lehrer is still breathing?
Healthcare DRINK!
At halftime, #Romney leads in all categories...especially time of possession
This debate is AWESOME...if you're an accounting major.
I was kidding when I told @BretBaier he might get called in from the moderator bench tonight.  Not so far-fetched now...
POTUS playing grandma card.  Break glass in case of emergency!
Did #Romney just fire Jim Lehrer in the middle of the debate by cutting PBS funding?
Jim Lehrer needs a nap
Romney seems FAR more confident and detailed than does POTUS
I see your study and raise you 2 studies.
Romney says the middle class has been buried.  Very Biden!
Ohh that's new..."economic patriotism". Does that mean if you don't pay enough taxes, you're unpatriotic!?!?
Don't you always wonder what they say to each other when the shake hands? "Hey, your tie is crooked"

#Grammys best Television Spectacle in years...until this. No, we won't be talking about his tomorrow
Who's going to the afterparty at Mickey's with Deadmau5, Modest Mouse and Danger Mouse? #Grammys
Security, take that stick out of Chris Brown's hand!
JHud!  Memba when American Idol said she wasn't good enough for the finals?
Why do we have to hear from the #Grammys president?  He's like a guidance counselor taking over the school assembly when it gets too rowdy.
That's the encore of a lifetime!  #GlennCampbell #Grammys
Dear #Grammys, Just hand Adele all the remaining awards, put on your bulletproof vest and head off to the afterparty.

‚Äú@Marty2634: @RoeConn what it's like Co-Hosting "The Roe & Roeper Weekday Afternoons on 890 WLS AM in Chicago?‚Äù. Best job in the world!
‚Äú@hannahaggie: Two words:  Hairbeas corpus‚Äù couldn't have said it better myself!
6 hours straight of live radio feels a bit like 15 minutes in an F-16.
The best thing about today's Blago verdict is it marks the end of "Primetime Blago."
Delusions of grand-hair RT @cubsgirl23: Did you see Blago's Twitter account still says he is serving as Governor?
#2 Newspaper leak forced us to step in early.
#1. We don't like to see Senate seats sold. Our job is to try to prevent crime not just prosecute crime.
Fitzgerald says there were 2 reasons for stopping Blago before he sold the senate seat.
Fitzgerald: "This is a bittersweet moment."
US Atty Patrick Fitzgerald stepping to the podium now. The hits keep coming.
Judy Baar Topinka says the Blagojevich verdict sends clear message: "Play by the rules. If you don't bad things are going to happen to you."
Judy Baar Topinka joins us in the studio right now.
Blagojevich jurors speaking now. Called Blago's testimony "manipulative" at times. These jurors are sharp.
Rumor in the office is that WLS has already offered Blagojevich a talk show to start in 2311.
Blagojevich talking outside his house now.
Blagojevich as he exits the building: "I'm disappointed and stunned" ... "Not much left to say."
Blagojevich coming to the microphone.
Blagojevich retrial scorecard: http://t.co/wXpvF4m
If Blago holds a post-verdict press conference, we'll bring it to you live: http://t.co/9q0Hlkb
My guess, by the way, is 8 years and out the door for Blagojevich.
Check that! Blago eligible for 300 years total for this trial plus 5 from the first. This is why you shouldn't do radio, tweet, and math.
I'm guessing a plea deal looks pretty good right about now.
If my math is right, Blagojevich is eligible for a maximum 350 years sentence for this trial. Plus another 5 years from the first trial.
So just to recap - Blagojevich was found guilty of 17 counts, jury was hung on 2 counts, and not guilty on 1 count. Ouch.
Check that on Count 11 - jury was hung on that count
GUILTY on Count 19
GUILTY on Count 18
NOT GUILTY on Count 17
Count 16 skipped
GUILTY on Count 15
GUILTY on Count 14
GUILTY on Count 13
GUILTY on Count 3
GUILTY on Count 12 - Children's Memorial attempted extortion
GUILTY on Count 11
Blagojevich GUILTY on all wire fraud counts
GUILTY on Count 10
GUILTY on Count 9 - racetrack scheme
GUILTY on Count 8
GUILTY on Count 7
GUILTY on Count 6
GUILTY on Count 5
GUILTY on Count 4
GUILTY on Count 3
GUILTY on Count 2
GUILTY on Count 1
Here comes your Blagojevich verdict.
Judge Zagel and the jury making their way into the courtroom.
Media has been let into the courtroom. Looking like a 2pm verdict.
Prosecutors and US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald have entered the courtroom to hear the Blagojevich verdict. Only minutes away now.
I'll give you the verdict count by count on Twitter as well.
Blagojevich is in the courthouse. Verdict is imminent. Hear our coverage live here: http://t.co/9q0Hlkb
Blagojevich is entering the Dirksen Federal Building, looking a little less confident than the last trial.
News helicopter are chasing Blago's SUV. Where have I seen that before???
If he thinks he's "All Shook Up" now, wait until they read the verdict.
Blago's statement as he leaves home for courtroom: "My hands are shaking, my knees are weak, and I can't seem to stand on my own two feet."
Blagojevich jury agrees on 18 of 20 counts. I'm on @wlsam890 now and will bring you the verdict live.

‚Äú@mikeb31772: @RoeConn Paper or plastic?" Good question for Mitt!  #cnndebate

I just read the Supreme Court's decision to Burt Odelson. The media got the decision before the attorneys in the case. #TimesChange
Burt Odelson, the lead attorney pressing the residency issue, says "it ends here" - he won't appeal the Rahm ruling.
IL Supreme Court overturns Appellate Court and rules #Rahm meets residency requirement. Rahm stays in the race.
They tell me the Rahm ruling is imminent. But they've told me that for the past 48 hours.
Rahm ruling is expected to come down very soon. Stand by, people.
Illinois Supreme Court issues stay to keep Rahm's name on the ballot until they can consider the case. Game on.
Rich and I have paid out on our bet with @GovWalker -- I feel so dirty. http://twitpic.com/3t35eq
Given the timing of the decision, Rahm prob won't be on the ballot even if he WINS his appeal. He'd have to run as a 'write-in' candidate.
The big winner is Caleb Hanie now expected to enter the mayor's race as the consensus anti-Cutler candidate.
Appeals court tosses Rahm off the ballot with a 2-1 vote. He does not meet the residency requirement.
