Quality time with this gremlin https://t.co/iIaXxYrmMc
It shouldn’t be about getting to the “pot of gold”. I feel more energy needs to be given to who we become while chasing it.
@DeanRey92535832 @BravoTV Thanks! I’m not opposed to my own show. If it’s meant to be it will happen.

Grateful to have finished 2018 on such a high note. If last year taught me anything it's that the people closest to me are my biggest support system.

@shirleyann32 @dragonbait205 @DonaldJTrumpJr It doesn’t matter when. It starts now. It starts with us. We shouldn’t be divided. We are American
@dragonbait205 @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you implying that makes it right? It’s time to take the high road on both sides. No more excuses. It starts with us..
@DonaldJTrumpJr Disgracefully and unamerican to mock this hero who fought for our country.
@olsonbjorno I understand but am 100% ok with current laws in place.
Laws &gt; emotions 🇺🇸
@EmilyEggbert @misspedia74 @MikeTokes I tried to have a meaningful dialogue with you but you’re too set in your ways to respect another person’s point of view. Wish you all the best
@EmilyEggbert @misspedia74 @MikeTokes What I find interesting is why you have the need to feel superior to others when you tell them they are in denial. For this reason is what grew the movement bigger than its ever been and why 2016 played out the way it did. Keep it up if you want a repeat
@misspedia74 @EmilyEggbert @MikeTokes I was very disappointed in the DNC for what they did to Bernie and still am. I don’t pat myself on the back for anything. I simply live in truth and represent it at all costs.
@EmilyEggbert @misspedia74 @MikeTokes This is the real problem. Everyone’s too busy telling people they are right and others are wrong. I don’t really care as long as people are thinking for themselves. The polls will determine which way the country moves next week.
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr They are fueling more division with “pointing the finger” rhetoric. It’s obvious to many and they aren’t fooling any of us. We are the silent majority who seek out the truth each and every day with no tolerance for bs.
@misspedia74 @MikeTokes It’s my choice to speak my truth. You trying to control? Control is what got this country into the mess it’s in
@braindirt88 @MikeTokes I’m probably order than you lol
@GarsOrdinaire @RealCandaceO @DonaldJTrumpJr Sarcasm or not. Was in very poor taste.
@RealCandaceO @DonaldJTrumpJr What HRC said should never be spoken out of anyone’s mouth. Her colors are really showing more now than ever before. I have no tolerance regardless of the intention behind those ignorant words. Love what you’re doing to get the truth out Candace! 🇺🇸👊🏻
@MikeTokes Disgusting for HRC to even take it to that level. Joking or not. Shame on her. “They all look alike” is a phrase that should never even come out of her mouth. Glad she won’t ever be president.

@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump I’m aware and the economy is booming for all socioeconomic classes. Lowest unemployment rate. I couldn’t be happier for America. Still a long way to go but such an amazing start no doubt.
@stampsfaninsask @realDonaldTrump Thx Robert. I’ve always thought for myself. That will never change..
@realDonaldTrump Not a question of “could”. He will.. 🇺🇸
@Deaner1000 @PressSec @POTUS It’s true people have the right who to serve at their establishments. We need to start respecting each other’s differences rather than alienate and judge. Two wrongs don’t make a right. 🇺🇸
@PressSec @POTUS Absolutely disgusting behavior. That restaurant did not do the right thing by kicking you out. Their actions will cost them future business for sure. 🇺🇸
@Kimzolciak 💯
@Scaramucci 💯🇺🇸
@demiro3 💯👍🏻
@nyc88888 The president just signed an executive order to end family separation which was compassionate and I was very happy to see that done.
@Smithbo It’s a mess on both sides. The cages and horrible immigration policies were in effect way before the Trump admin. It’s not his fault but it is his issue &amp; ours. He did the right thing by signing the order not to separate families.
Do all things with kindness, compassion, truth, and integrity. You will be blessed beyond measure.

@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump It’s so blatantly obvious what the top guys at the FBI were up to. It goes against our democracy which I can’t support under any circumstance. Hillary was the worst candidate in my opinion. 🇺🇸

@missalyssajules 41
@Katy52 @kkddcaydee @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump It’s not going to happen cause that is a false narrative. One which you and many others are holding on to for dear life. I’m a realist. The odds that narrative proves to be true is slim to none.
@lostinabss @kkddcaydee @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump I don’t lie
@Katy52 @kkddcaydee @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump Couldn’t be more false. You will see
@SomeoneIsSalty @Squirl00 @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump The point is what he’s doing isn’t hurting it will only help America. He’s a businessman and very well versed in how this process works.
@Jamma1313 @realDonaldTrump Google
@ScribeWandering @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump It’s ok baby steps. As long as it’s in a forward momentum we will all benefit. Rome wasn’t built in a day.
@TrayFuqua @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump Not all prayers were answered in that horrible time but others were as a result of the survivors. Nevertheless it was extremely tragic to say the least. In today’s times be the voice that encourages peace, not hate, to ensure the past isn’t repeated.
@Squirl00 @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump He is right to say that we are paying too much in trade to other countries. He isn’t trashing just being honest. I respect that talk.
@kkddcaydee @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump That narrative has been disproven. Even the media has moved on from it.
@AveryChasten @MPMontague2 @realDonaldTrump Yup. Just figured that out 👍🏻
@AveryChasten @realDonaldTrump Thanks. Goodness and truth will always prevail.
@patrici59152026 @gcamp4 @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump I wasn’t referring to our president. I was responding to the person who tweeted in opposition. I 100% support POTUS
@MPMontague2 @realDonaldTrump I don’t see it like that so I’ll just agree to disagree. We are all concerned since we occupy this world together. But a lot of good is being done. I’m a proud American. Pray for peace.
@TrayFuqua @realDonaldTrump I only speak my truth and represent goodness. I never fear the truth and represent it with all of my energy. I completely accept anything that happens as a result.
@THCobbPHC @Oytaki @realDonaldTrump I would never condescend. We are all equal and worthy of our opinions. But name calling and putting people down is never acceptable.
@THCobbPHC @Oytaki @realDonaldTrump You are only responsible for what you say and do. What goes around comes around.
@Oytaki @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump These comments are truthfully so sad. Such negative energy which does you or nobody else any good. I wish you could see that we make a better impact in this life w/ positive energy.
@THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump 👍🏻✌🏻☮️
@THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump I bet you’re a good person but these comments are so petty. The bigger picture here is peace. That is worth all of the energy in the world.
@Earnold88100463 @THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump 💯
@THCobbPHC @realDonaldTrump I get it you don’t support his agenda. Do you support peace? If so. I encourage you to pray for him and the world cause this is a very important meeting.
@realDonaldTrump Peace through strength. Thank you for your strong leadership! History in the making..✌🏻💪🏻🇺🇸

@koolhandkim My best advice is to be an assistant to a top producing agent in the area he wants to work for at least 3 to 4 years. Here’s a link to a lecture I did at Crossroads School on the topic—&gt; https://t.co/ryzkTnfG4N
@BVTech 💯
Destroy the idea that you have to be constantly working or grinding in order to be successful. Embrace the concept that rest, recovery, and reflection are essential parts of the progress towards a successful and ultimately happy life.
Life is a process, not an outcome.

@IamCaseyJames Now I know where the term “Masshole” comes from 😂
@IamCaseyJames It’s 100% the truth. With that attitude you will never manifest a life that you don’t need a vacation from. I’m giving you the gold. Up to you if you want to believe it or not. Good luck
@IamCaseyJames It’s called manifesting your reality through hard work, discipline, and commitment. Make sense now or still over your head?
Whatever your current circumstances, if you can imagine something better for yourself, you can create it.
I believe that the entire universe is always working in our favor. If it doesn’t open, it’s not your door. There’s something better on the way!
@stoolpresidente 💯
@ScottPresler Yup! Genius!! 🇺🇸👏🏻

@heyismee The fact that it’s a people business. I like the 1 on 1 interaction. Plus I have the best boss- Myself! Lol
@nyc88888 I’m having the best year of my career and it’s only February. Why you making stuff up? Lol
@greg_gopher It will go back up. It’s mainly due to interest rates increasing. The economy and the real estate market are doing amazing!
@HarleysR4Chicks @Starlathechi You as well
@HarleysR4Chicks @Starlathechi Sorry to hear about your loss. Their lives are too short.
@Jewelsholograph Thx! Life is too short to be anything but positive. All the best!
Never give up on what you really want.

@harmonmarkets @Rysmom2004 I left the show and have absolutely no regrets. Life is too short for drama and negativity. My business is doing amazing and I couldn’t be happier.
@Rysmom2004 Thx but I would never return to that show. I closed that chapter for good when I left. Having said that, I’m not opposed to doing my own show as long as it’s the right fit. Have something cooking now.

@esteebass @Bravotv Starla is 10 but going on 2! Thx! I hear that a lot from the fans. Happy New Year!
Fall in love with where you are right now and everything will come to you. Gratitude attracts more gratitude. Appreciate the now and you will get so much more!
@RedPillBlack It disgusts me too! There’s no basis for anyone to compare Trump to that evil monster. 🇺🇸
@Royorbisonjr Happy birthday Barbara! She was the most amazing person! Miss her
@TylerElsa @RealJamesWoods @POTUS They all need to be tied together. I’m confidant it will get done. 🇺🇸
@followberman Anna is the best! Lol
@JeffHaring She’s an American citizen. I don’t agree with her political views but I have to say she is highly entertaining
@aduanebrown That’s why I won’t discuss politics with her but she keeps me entertained 😂😂😂
I think it’s safe to say Anna isn’t a “Trumper”. I had no idea how political she was until tonight! Sound on 😂🇺🇸 https://t.co/9jmJeYKfk8

@shediac_acadian @SandyStarzy Very true! I’ve done all the work I needed to on myself and don’t take things as serious anymore.
@shanedawson What his name?? Lol
@SandyStarzy @shediac_acadian Thx! I don’t spend as much time on it anymore! Lol
Celebrated my dad’s 70th with family and his closest friends. It’s moments like this that I’ll cherish forever. 🎂🎉 https://t.co/oD7s7oa7ML
@SandyStarzy @shediac_acadian Hilarious!! Glad I was be able to clarify “name gate”.
@SandyStarzy @shediac_acadian If you 2 were on TV I would so watch!! Happy New Year!
@SandyStarzy @shediac_acadian She started off by calling me “chaddy cakes” so I did the same thing to her name. But then I got lazy and just called her cake. Lol
@shediac_acadian @SandyStarzy Cake lol
@NEBeachGal I’m keeping my hairstyle. I don’t give AF what you or anyone thinks about it. I’ve sold over $400 Million worth of real estate with it so what you wrote isn’t true.
@BingeWars Lol
@missingcjt Thx!! Happy New Year!
@Esolace Thx! Happy New Year!!
@sipnremy Happy New Year Jack. Not sure. Good luck!
@saucystaci @jebishop Exactly!! People need to stop making a big deal out of that off the record conversation. If he does it as president then it makes sense to have an issue with it. In life we all live and learn and I’m sure he knows better now.
@CoronerPBR I’m a big believer in 2nd chances. So moving on to MAGA..
@jebishop And before you say what he said wasn’t presidential, he said that as a civilian. You never said anything you wish you could take back in your life? Maybe you’re just perfect then..
@jebishop I highly respect women. Yes he was wrong to say that but for you to hang him on that alone is highly insensitive. He’s allowed to make mistakes as a human. And yes woman are my thing. People who state whatever they feel without merit are the real problem with America right now.
@Septimbersells Exactly cause she would’ve been destroying our country under the radar. Love how President Trump is exposing all the Clinton cronies and corruption.
@aduanebrown 💯🇺🇸💪🏻
This is my favorite season of “Trump’s America”. So many new villains, backstabbing, and overall drama. The cast and writers are so talented! #MAGA 🇺🇸
@realDonaldTrump You are 100% correct! So glad you are the president! 🇺🇸
@stoolpresidente @TuckerCarlson Watched your segment! Great job!!! Happy New Year
The moment you start acting like life is a blessing, it starts feeling like one.
@MarbleheadGuru Thx!
@RealStacyEvan Me too!!! Finally see how corrupt the other side was!! Never knew until I got well informed. They tried to pull a fast one. HRC makes me sick to my stomach.
@MikeTokes @DonaldJTrumpJr @TrumpGirlStrong @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @TuckerCarlson Finally!! Can’t wait to see this one play out!

@Ry_I_Am I knew there was a miscommunication. Happy New Year!
@Ry_I_Am @RealOmarNavarro Agreed! 🇺🇸
@bigmammawelsh I think you thought I was tweeting my initial tweet about Omar but I wasn’t. Read it again. I’m one of his supporters like you.
@Ry_I_Am @bigmammawelsh @RealOmarNavarro I think you’re confused I 100% agree with Omar.
@Ry_I_Am @RealOmarNavarro I’m on Omar’s side. Who’s are you on?
@bigmammawelsh @RealOmarNavarro YOU need to be an adult and respect the fact that I have just as much right to my opinion as you. Petty words will never get you anywhere in life.
@SandyBeach727 @bigmammawelsh @RealOmarNavarro Omar and the other supporters should have had equal rights to stand where the other people were. It’s obvious they weren’t respected and that’s a fact.
@RealOmarNavarro Thx!
@RealOmarNavarro I would expect more out of people who preach equality. Such hypocrites with large platforms. Happy New Year Omar!
@realDonaldTrump 💯🇺🇸
@realDonaldTrump My favorite 4 words! 🇺🇸
@LauraLoomer @AdamHerbets That’s the very reason why I follow you Laura. Don’t let these media bullies get to you. All we care about are the facts. Consider yourself lucky you don’t have to answer to anyone, unlike them. Happy New Year!

@ryanghinds Got it! Thx for the info
@ryanghinds What site? I have something in the works. Happy New Year
@Jewelsholograph Nothing wrong with that!! Lol
Happy New Year!! What’s your #1 resolution for the year? Mine is to travel more.
@nyc88888 @RyanAFournier Hope so! If it’s not someone that was cleared such a bad look for his security detail.
@aduanebrown @RyanAFournier It’s a total security threat. Surprised the security service wasn’t aware!
@RyanAFournier How did they get that close to our president. Something isn’t right with that.
@Esolace I will show her. Happy Holidays to you and your family!

@ScottPresler I couldn’t have said it better myself Scott! 💯
Raise your standards and the Universe will meet you there. When you truly believe in yourself there are no limits. Happy Holidays!

@CelesteJMarek @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr Agreed! They just talk/tweet in circles. We are all going to have more $$$. Happy Holidays!
@ronkonkama @jrothmtg I don’t care what is socially/politically correct. It’s not Christmas yet therefor it’s Happy Holidays.
@TylerElsa @realDonaldTrump Thx for being a fan! To make it fair on my following I only follow my personal friends. Hope you understand and Happy Holidays!
@realDonaldTrump Finally!!! Thank you
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama Or some learn from other people’s mistakes. So the solution is to either double down and repeat with a different outcome or to go a different direction. Our president just doubled down.
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama I agree history repeats but not in all circumstances.
@jrothmtg Thx! I’ll get the name of them and tweet it to you later.
@jrothmtg Thx! My remodel felt like it was never gonna end lol. Here’s a link to my home tour. https://t.co/JF1Qzwysbh
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama Great question!! I’m not psychic so I can’t answer that one. I hope the positive changes last a very very long time. Only time will tell. History doesn’t repeat itself 100% of the time. We all need to have faith and trust. I do
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr @BarackObama “After” is the pivotal word and truest in your response. President Trump came “after” Obama which I for one am grateful for. At this point I will agree to disagree. I’m not a religious person but I believe in god and the future, as with everything, is up to him.
@RealOmarNavarro @RealAlexJones @Millie__Weaver @infowars 👍🏻👍🏻
@PoliticalShort It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to figure that one out lol🤔🇺🇸
@jrothmtg @PressSec @POTUS The truth will always prevail. Happy holidays!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Family affair! Love it
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr If all the same economic factors back then applied now then the critics might have a fair argument but it’s a completely different economic time which is what I meant in an earlier response. I’ll man up if I’m wrong in 2027 but I doubt that will be the case.😉
@PressSec @POTUS 💯🇺🇸
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr Nobody can say with total certainty it will be one way or the other in 9 years from now. Anyone who says it will prove to be a disaster in 2027 is just speculating. But I respect your opinion.
@davecrimmen Thx! Going great. Happy holidays
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr At the end of the day it’s just an article. The outcome will depend on so many moving factors too early to tell. At least for now the majority of Americans (Rich/Middle class) will get tax relief.
@ReligiousJezta @MiimiBayer2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr Let’s see in 2027. You will either be right or wrong. But for now we will receive greater cuts and that makes me very happy.
@ReligiousJezta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr Like I stated before only time will tell. But I’m all for it moving forward.
@MiimiBayer2 @ReligiousJezta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr It’s going to put more money in the majority of American pockets and that’s enough for me.
@ReligiousJezta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr I read it and agree but it still doesn’t mean that the majority of Americans are losers. The proof is really in the pudding and time will tell. I feel the majority of Americans will be better off.
@DiamondandSilk So many presents for Christmas! Getting spoiled!!!! 🎄🇺🇸#MAGA
@ReligiousJezta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr 85.4% represent the vast majority of Americans and they will receive a tax cut. Only 5.1% of Americans will see a tax increase. https://t.co/bbccGfl5DZ
Looks like Christmas is coming early! Thx @POTUS! 🎄🇺🇸#TaxReform #MAGA @RealDonaldTrump @PressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr

@dolphyfan I will never politically label myself. I’m only on one side and that’s the side of truth.
@RayLigaya Best advice! Happy holidays!!
@heyismee Thx!! Agreed. Happy holidays
@afroconserv Thx! Happy holidays
Self-discipline is everything. If you can conquer your physical and mental being, you can conquer anything in the world.
@ReligiousJezta Agreed! #PersistenceInTruth
@martasue No worries. We all are pissed on both sides. But everything needs to be done in truth. I have no tolerance for BS. Thx for the compliment and Happy Holidays!
@martasue Who you calling little boy?? I’m 40 lol There’s corrupt on both sides.
@steftravels I can’t speak for everyone but I feel it’s my responsibility to be politically aware. So I’m watching everything that happens daily. I’m hoping for the best as well. Happy Holidays!
I’m all for the swamp getting drained but it needs to be done ethically and in truth. The Alabama election got politically dirty. We will persist and continue the fight in 2020. #MAGA

@RealStacyEvan Agreed. I find it so sad cause everyone has a path to happiness if they do the hard work. It took me all of the last 7 years and I had to completely disconnect from many things. Grateful I figured it out.
@claudia61160929 True peace comes when your mind, body, and soul are connected. Anything short of that is denial.
@claudia61160929 Yes but that’s not success to me
Inner peace is the new success
@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump @ABC In some cases yes
@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump @ABC This is what happens when civilized people disagree.
@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Thx. I respect your opinion but am obviously very passionate about mine. Happy holidays.
@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump @ABC You see the gloss of my success but if you truly studied my path you would know it wasn’t an easy journey. I was a waiter in college living pay check to pay check and then a real estate assistant for many years after.
@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Yes but they cut me off at 21 and I declared bankruptcy due to very high credit card debt out of college. Learned my lesson. Bought my home 12 years later with no loan or help. Made all my own connections.
@Juicebox911 @Eye2eyecandy And I thought they were an honorable party for many years. Had me completely fooled! Thankful for Trump.
@Juicebox911 @Eye2eyecandy This is what they do when they don’t agree. I find it so sad. I really don’t care if they share the same political views as me but at the very least show respect.
@Eye2eyecandy All of what you wrote is complete bs. Remember in this country everyone is innocent until proven guilty. He has done nothing wrong. I don’t even want your follow cause you have no respect.
@realDonaldTrump It always made sense to me! You are winning and they hate it. 🇺🇸
@Deaner1000 @realDonaldTrump @ABC If you truly researched my path to success you would know I earned every penny on my own. Everything is very well documented online.
@realDonaldTrump @ABC America is winning and your movement is strongest it’s ever been. Keep up the good fight. I’m with you 100%! 🇺🇸
@realDonaldTrump We never doubted you. 🇺🇸#AmericaFirst #BestPresident

@kahreennaa @przsu @RealOmarNavarro You have the right to your opinion but I’m sure you are aware that a lot of Mexican Americans are in favor of the wall and cracking down on illegal immigration. I’m 100% pro legal immigration. Omar has my vote.
@ZachTurner_ @RealOmarNavarro That couldn’t be farther from the truth Zach. I’m for the rights and freedoms of every American. But I have no tolerance for anyone who doesn’t respect this country. 🇺🇸

@trumplove63 @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Thx for being a fan! Love our president. #ProudAmerican 🇺🇸
@DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS 💯😞
@DonaldJTrumpJr Heartbroken over the ruling. Grateful @POTUS is president. 🇺🇸
@RealOmarNavarro @ZachTurner_ Clearly! My parents always taught me to treat others how you would want to be treated. We all come from the same place. Goodness will always prevail over evil.
@ZachTurner_ @RealOmarNavarro Such a cheap shot on your part. What happened to being respectful to others? Am I missing something?
@FoxNews Such a below the belt move on her part. You should always stay true to your opinion but be respectful to others at the very least.
@LauraLoomer It doesn’t make any sense to me either!
@RealOmarNavarro We need it more than ever! I’m sick over today’s ruling
@LauraLoomer Disgusted
@MikeTokes Completely disgusted over this decision
You are exactly where you need to be. Trust the process. Trust yourself.
@ScottBaio @RealOmarNavarro 100% support Omar! We need him to win!

@UpStateHousewif Thanks Alli!
Focus on becoming a better person, don’t let the world’s negativity change you.
@ProJcanty500 This home would be about $20MM so $135,000/MO is a deal. Rental rate is most always relative based on how much home is worth. Make sense?
Never chase love, money, or success. Become the best version of yourself and those things will chase you.
@skulleeroz1217 The 1%
@skulleeroz1217 That's not a factor as the full rent is always paid in advance.
@skulleeroz1217 Of course!
@steftravels It does!
Leased out this Malibu Colony beachfront home which I have listed at $135,000 per month (Summer rate) for the next few months. https://t.co/aBNngQdry2

@LauraLoomer 👌🏻
@CEO Agreed! Love it!
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones Now you know :)
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones Thanks Chris! Just for the record I don't support him.
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones I respect how passionately you feel in your truth. Take care Chris!
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones "Good" in any context of exposing the truth needs 2 b said. His other context doesn't apply to my "good" response. We must always seek truth
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones If we don't have ethics we don't have anything. We have to protect the truth at all costs! I agree w/ you that he has hurt many w/ his words
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones I only said "good job" for exposing Megyn who was wrong in this regard. My "good job" does not pertain to anything else he has said.
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones I agree with you but it wasn't ethical on her part to set up the interview w/ deceit and manipulation. That's what I am 100% against.
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones I don't agree w/ harassing parents at all. If you listen to the preinterview w/ Megyn he says it 100% happened but the MSM isn't airing that
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones It's all good Chris. Believe whatever you want and I wish you the absolute best life has to offer!
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones It's never vile to expose the truth in any context which is what I stand behind specifically relating to Megyn Kelly's deceit towards him.
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones I only said "good job" to him in the context of exposing Megyn Kelly.
@ChrisAlan1969 @RealAlexJones I never said I agree w/ his theories. I gave him props for exposing the truth w/ Megyn. I wasn't kicked off I left-&gt;&gt;https://t.co/NM4CMc5K73
@RealAlexJones I've never listened to your show but after watching the interview it's obvious what happened to you. You exposed the truth. Good job!
Don't lose hope. You never know what tomorrow might bring.

@___wait4it___ @hackettp @Stevey_B_good @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I'm not qualified to say what ban would be non-discriminatory and legal but if it was revised upholding the constitution I would support it.
@jennifro @___wait4it___ @hackettp @Stevey_B_good @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Both are important issues that need to be addressed. I'm not qualified to give a solution to it but agree that the madness needs to stop.
@dhosborne @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump That is true but I'm 100% about supporting the constitution and following our laws.
@GavinMatts @MikeSpencer21 I don't give more than I give so not going to do it but I have full faith in you that you can work and afford the coffee on your own.
@MikeSpencer21 @GavinMatts Just cause I have it doesn't mean I need to give it to people asking for $ on twitter. I give a lot to charity each year. Hope u understand
@anjalialii Agreed
@Belle292009 @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Anything 45 wants to pass that isn't legal will not be approved so I'm not worried. I have full faith in our checks and balance system.
@anjalialii I don't believe that. A ban could be legal and not discriminatory as long as those being banned are a direct and credible threat to America
@GavinMatts You don't need my $4.50 lol. I share the same love for coffee as you! I need my iced Americano everyday.
@GavinMatts If that was the truth I could retire. Fake news lol. But I'm grateful for life's blessings. I wish you much health, success, and happiness!
@nathanpboston @InwoodKeith @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Oh...Got it
@nathanpboston @InwoodKeith @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I don't oppose the 1st amendment.
@theCJS @everybuddha @realDonaldTrump Got it. My grandfather was from Winnipeg. I have family in Alberta.
@theCJS @everybuddha @realDonaldTrump That article on me is from the truth. Lol. Anyway I appreciate &amp; grateful for all my blessings. I wish you both the best as fellow Americans
@PaigePLetter @NoHateNoWall @Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump I will never support hate. I support the president &amp; will do everything I can to empower him w/ respect &amp; goodness. No good comes from hate.
@NoHateNoWall @PaigePLetter @Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump I agree not to be silent but to make your voice heard coming from a place of goodness not hate. He represents himself &amp; you represent you.
@ChrisHashtags @realDonaldTrump That's assuming he is racist which is 100% your opinion. I don't see it that way. Nevertheless I respect you as a fellow American.
@shivm231 @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump A ban that bans people who are a direct credible threat to America is the only ban I'm in favor of.
@ChrisHashtags @realDonaldTrump You are entitled to your opinion Chris. Not everyone who supports him is "racist". You are making too big of a generalization.
@PaigePLetter @NoHateNoWall @Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump We represent solely who we are. So I come from a place of goodness than from a place of hate. These hateful comments towards him don't help
@DanielBoswell @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Absolutely not cause the law wouldn't support it based on driscrimination.
@CharlieMike87 @Stevey_B_good @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I never did. I just gave him a thumbs up that I support him based on 2 things. He's the president and I'm pro security as long as its legal
@___wait4it___ @hackettp @Stevey_B_good @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I never said that I supported that specific ban. But I do support a ban if it is deemed legal. If it passes it can't discriminate.
@NoHateNoWall @PaigePLetter @Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump I don't condone what he said. But the bottom line is he is the president so we need to be empowering him w/ goodness than petty hate talk.
@lestathavana @theCJS @realDonaldTrump I have full faith in this country &amp; our lawmakers. We should b empowering him w/ love &amp; goodness rather than hate talk. Good always prevails
@ChildofLight16 @theCJS @realDonaldTrump Thanks!! I'm 100% pro legal security for our country.
@KObrien33525 @theCJS @realDonaldTrump $0 lol
@theCJS @realDonaldTrump It's all good! Everybody is entitled to their opinions.
@BeanBagChairBob @theCJS @realDonaldTrump Thanks! I turned 40 a few months ago.
@NoviceRunnerJMH @theCJS @realDonaldTrump That's not my calling in life. I'm proud to be an American but don't have any desire right now to be in politics.
@wreck_tech @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump If it's passes it's legal and not based on discrimination. If it's illegal I'm not for it.
@wreck_tech It's a principle that I live on and apply it to everything I do.
@DarkHorseImages @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I'm giving him a thumbs up for #1 being my president and 2nd wanting to protect America anything he does will need to be legally approved.
@wreck_tech @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I'm not on any specific race or religion. I'm in favor of a ban on any person that poses a legal credible direct threat to America.
@DarkHorseImages @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump It will only pass if it's legal. If it discriminates it's illegal. If it passes I'm for it. I have full faith in our checks and balances.
@NoviceRunnerJMH @theCJS @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't be interested in that. I'm happy where I'm at in life. Don't need more than I have. Very grateful for my blessings.
@theCJS @realDonaldTrump I was on TV for many years selling high-end real estate which I've been doing for the last 19 years. I wish you the best as well!
@STEPD0C @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Perfect. That is what I'm in favor of. If we need to implement new legal bans based on any additional threats I'm for those as well.
@theCJS @realDonaldTrump I don't need or want that. Lol
@theCJS @realDonaldTrump There are obviously people that are for it and others that are not. But I represent what I wrote. I stand with my president.
@ColleenJensen17 @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump There are credible and legal examples of threats to this country. I'm for those people being banned. But not in favor of discrimination.
@ColleenJensen17 @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Agreed!
@STEPD0C @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Which country doesn't matter. Anyone who is a direct, legal, and credible threat to America is the only way I would be in favor of a ban.
@SarahLume @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Anyone who is a direct credible and legal threat to this country. Anything short of that is discrimination.
@HezPwr @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Then it will never get approved. I'm only for a legal ban.
@kwil0944 @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Only those that are a direct legal credible threat to America. Anything short of that is discrimination.
@NewaHailu @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I won't answer that cause I know that scenario would never happen. I have 100% faith in my country and its lawmakers.
@yoesh82 @realDonaldTrump I never said I was in favor of that specific ban. I am in favor of a ban that is based on a direct credible legal threat to this country.
@TaylorB189 @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Have a great day Taylor! :)
@GDanendraH @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Correct. I would only be in favor of a ban as long as it proves that the specific people are a direct credible legal threat to America.
@CaBaldridge @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Ok. I agree. So therefor it will need to be revised to not discriminate or the ban will never get approved and I'll be against it.
@MegMusselman @PaigePLetter @Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump My statement is not limited to the president. We need to come at everyone w/ love &amp; goodness. Not hate and negatively. Goodness prevails.
@ElOsoFurioso @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump That person posing a threat can be from any country. So he will need to revise and prove the threat or no ban.
@ElOsoFurioso @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump You can only ban if a person is a direct legal threat to the country. Anything short of that is discrimination.
@NewaHailu @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump So of course it can be changed/altered to not discrimate. If it discriminates it will never get approved and therefor I'm not for it.
@KristenC121411 @misjudge_me @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I never say never. I believe that everything will work out for the best of this country as long as we are good to each other.
@TaylorB189 @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Wow. You have no respect for those that you don't agree with. Nevertheless I wish you health and happiness.
@TwitfishCatcher @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Exactly. So therefor it will need to be altered to not discriminate. If it proves to be legal after being revised I am in favor of it.
@KristenC121411 @misjudge_me @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump That is why we need to empower him more than ever with goodness cause he is our president and in power. Goodness always prevails.
@psmoylan @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump It would need to be one that proves those being banned are a DIRECT, SOLID, and LEGAL threat to this country.
@fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump Agreed! I wish you the best my fellow American.
@KristenC121411 @misjudge_me @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump We all solely represent ourselves. I represent goodness/truth to fight evil/lies. Nothing good ever comes from hate.
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump Those are great qualities to represent!
@TwitfishCatcher @KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I'm not saying I agree w/ all of his ideas either but what I am saying is that we need to empower him w/ goodness rather than this hate talk
@fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump It's very clear how you feel. That's why we have checks &amp; balances. Nothing will get passed that isn't legal &amp; for the best of this country
@fuelgrannie @KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I respect your opinion but I feel very strongly toward mine.
@KateofNewYork1 @fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump Yes. I have 100% faith in our country and lawmakers.
@fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump Agreed. There is a healthy way to channel energy to do goodness. Nothing good comes from attacking &amp; calling names. Empower through love.
@KateofNewYork1 @fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump Yes. Defend/represent go hand in hand. That's why nothing which is illegal will ever get approved in this country.
@shadow_ecco @FarRightInfidel @nathanpboston @hackettp @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump @lsarsour @SadiqKhan If that is the context he said it in then I would 100% agree. They can happen at anytime which is the world we are living in.
@fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump Whatever he is. He is our president. So we need to empower him more than ever by spreading positive energy and not this negative hatred.
@fuelgrannie @Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump I'm representing myself not him. Nothing good will ever get accomplished through hating him. We need to always represent goodness.
@misjudge_me @KristenC121411 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump He is our president. Nothing good comes from hate. Now is the time where we have to spread so much positive energy to him &amp; our country.
@PaigePLetter @Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump I support a president of mine. I will empower him with love and goodness and have no tolerance for disrespect. Nothing good comes from hate.
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump Now that's the spirit! Lol
@hackettp @ragin16ths @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Sounds good Patrick. Take care
@misjudge_me @KristenC121411 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump We are first &amp; foremost Americans. I love this country. We need to spread goodness and love cause nothing positive  comes from anger &amp; hate.
@ragin16ths @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump Discrimination is never necessary. But there are legal reasons for a ban as long as those being banned are a direct solid legal threat.
@hackettp @Stevey_B_good @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I truly don't see that happening. We have too many leaders that will ensure that anything passed is legal based on our safety as Americans.
@nathanpboston @Joemdouglasjr2 @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump The ban he put on the table will obviously need to change so it's not discriminatory. If it's legal &amp; based on a solid threat I'm all 4 it.
@lbs_sullivan @DesertDog1979 @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I don't believe that as long as those that are being banned are a solid direct legal threat to America.
@hackettp @Stevey_B_good @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump And we are doing a great job at that! I'm just saying that with new security threats additional legal measures will need to be considered.
@Stevey_B_good @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump As long as those that are being targeted are a direct solid threat to this country I am for a legal ban.
@Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump We all need to direct that message to him. He needs to be empowered through love and goodness.
@DesertDog1979 @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump That's for the political leaders to figure out. The ban would need to be based on a direct solid threat to America for it to be legal.
@hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with anyone who says get used to the attacks. Right now is a time where we need to put an end to this and not accept the evil.
@Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump It's ok. I understand your point of view and you are completely entitled to your personal opinion.
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I have one career which I've been in for 19 years. I sell high-end real estate. https://t.co/AslTXqvpwZ
@bastivargas @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I agree it needs to be reworked so it's not discriminatory. If it makes sense &amp; is legal I'm 4 it. I support him cause he is the president
@LoriAkin2 @realDonaldTrump You have a right to your opinion. Light and love to you and your family.
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump At the end of the day you &amp; I are both Americans and want the best for our country. He is our president &amp; we need to encourage him w/ love.
@hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump If he wants this travel ban it will need to be legal and not discrimate. I don't know how but I am all for one that makes America safer.
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I live my life treating people how I want to be treated. I respect you as a person and want nothing but the best for you and this country.
@DesertDog1979 @hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I know what you're implying. To be very clear I agree and am not for the previous ban. It needs to be reworked to not discriminate.
@SamerAbukhaled @KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I have seen some really good things come from him which I support. You have issues w/ specific items but not everything is backed by hate.
@Bill_ee_O @KateofNewYork1 @realDonaldTrump Only time will tell. You are right he is my president &amp; I have nothing but respect 4 his position. We will get more from goodness than hate
@dinnifree @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump 👍🏻
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump It's ok to agree to disagree but at the end of the day he's our president and we all need to encourage him through goodness and not hate.
@ElOsoFurioso @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump It obviously needs to be reworked so it's legal and doesn't discriminate.
@amandainlust So therefore a new ban will need to be put in place that does not discrimate and is legal. It needs to obviously be reworked.
@hackettp @shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump A ban can be justified based on a solid threat to this country. I don't know how  but I'm sure there is a solution that makes legal sense.
@DrLearnALot @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I know what you're saying and am not for that specific ban. It needs to be reworked to not discrimate and must be legal.
@KateofNewYork1 @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump Where is all this anger coming from? We can respect each other without cheap shots. I represent goodness which I'm sure you do too.
@baban_slemani @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump First off nobody has proof that he is pulling the strings and 2nd we need LEGAL action to start. I'm not for anything that discriminates.
@tonycelery @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with that. But you are entitled to your opinion.
@shadow_ecco @nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I understand what you're saying but it needs to be reworked to not discrimate. A ban is necessary in my opinion.
@icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump Thanks! Same to you as well!
@QuadrilleInfo @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump I'm sure you &amp; I both want the same thing for this world. Peace &amp; love is what I stand for. Calling people "morons" has the opposite effect.
@Ikea_Monkey_89 @icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump First off I'm 40 and 2nd calling people stupid is not respectful and puts negativity into the universe. We are all entitled to our opinions.
@nathanpboston @SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump I'm not in favor of that specific ban. But I am in favor of a ban as long as it doesn't discriminate.
@icutyourhair @realDonaldTrump You should buy a house! Home values continue to appreciate and will keep on increasing under the @realDonaldTrump administration.
@SinoReddit @WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump It's never ever right to signal out a specifically race or religion. A travel ban does make sense as long as it DOESN'T discriminate.
@WorkTurns2War @realDonaldTrump If that's how you feel ok. We are all entitled to our opinion. Thanks for following through the years :)
@realDonaldTrump Perfect! Keep up the good work! #ProudAmerican
@misjudge_me @Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump You have so much anger inside of you. I sincerely wish you the best! :)
@Bill_ee_O @realDonaldTrump I'm entitled to my opinion just like you. Be respectful cause negative energy you release in the universe always comes back to you.
@realDonaldTrump 100%! I stand with you 🇺🇸
@realDonaldTrump Agreed 👍🏻

@Leigh10002 It's heirloom tomatoes not relish
@lisaaiko It's just my food will upset her stomach and not healthy for her to eat. So I'm doing the right thing no exceptions.
@lisaaiko It does! I only give Starla her food.

There is always a new way to look at something. There is always a new approach to a situation. Forever be looking for that new way.

Realtor tip of the week: Be an expert and farm a specific neighborhood. Information is valuable and buyers/sellers will recognize your value
The things that money can't buy hold the most value of life's treasures! Too many people don't learn this lesson until it's too late..
When you feel like quitting, remember that sometimes you have to go through the worst before you can arrive at the best.

Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life. Tip toe if you must but take the step.
Keep the following fact in mind before giving up: A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence.
Be thankful for what you are now, and keep fighting for what you want to be tomorrow.
Today is the first day of the rest of your life. The next move is entirely up to you..

Ask yourself what is really important, and then have the wisdom and courage to build your life around your answer.
We all need to listen to our intuition cause if we don't it will eventually stop speaking to us.
@scribeking- I read your @Bankrate article. As you already know real estate agents aren't appraisers. Therefor the seller has no recourse.
A big reason people resist taking a chance is because they focus on what they have to give up rather than what they could gain.

Commitment means staying loyal to what you said you were going to do long after the mood you said it in has left you.

Your attitude towards life attracts people who need to learn a similar lesson to you, know this &amp; you will see more clearly..
You have no idea what you're capable of until you try!
You must channel your energy into your passions, for this will be the catalyst for prosperity within your life..
If it does not come naturally then it is not meant for you. If it is against your nature, life will never flow freely..
