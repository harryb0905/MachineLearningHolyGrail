Today, the House passed a resolution I authored remembering the victims &amp; survivors of the 1932-33 Ukraine Famine, known as #Holodomor. Its passage is another reflection of the basic values of the American people. | My statement: https://t.co/oLTmsw01zB

There can be no doubt about the culpability of Burma’s military in the oppression &amp; violence inflicted on the #Rohingya.
...the GM layoffs &amp; plant closings underscore why #NAFTA remains unpopular in industrial areas. The new NAFTA - renamed the #USMCA to avoid any association with the old one - still falls short on providing protections for workers, jobs, &amp; wages. | My op/ed https://t.co/XtF205PTIg
Without changes, in law and practice, that address the suppressed low wages &amp; dismantle the so-called protection agreements in Mexico, the new #NAFTA will continue conditions that have led to outsourced American jobs. https://t.co/vGbhyWXsEm
When he authored an article commenting on the continuing friendship that I shared with Gov. Milliken, I very much treasured it.  As we continued to stay in touch, he as always maintained his warm spirit despite the challenges he faced. So very many of us will very much miss him.
It was with deep sadness that I learned that George Weeks passed away. I got to know him first as press secretary for Governor William Milliken. Like the Governor, George combined civility and total dedication to his work and ideas.
The new #NAFTA fails to forcefully &amp; directly address the lack of assured &amp; real labor reform in Mexico, in language &amp; in practice. Failing that, it will only lock in the status quo of massive outsourcing to Mexico for decades to come &amp; its consequences. https://t.co/TAVWO5ub2F
There has been this major shift of production to Mexico. So much new #NAFTA talk centers on rules of origin and composition percentages but misses the core problem of suppressed, low wages in Mexico that leads to the race to the bottom that contributes to American jobs lost. https://t.co/EqcRTNyxyJ
The recent GM announcement must serve as a major wake up call. Mexico’s persistent, suppressed low wages of a few dollars per hour caused a major outsourcing of vehicle &amp; supplier production to Mexico, suppressing American wages &amp; creating job loss. - https://t.co/iceSPxNyxO

"#Holodomor is both a cry for freedom and a cry against authoritarianism." - from my remarks today before the plenary session of the Ukrainian Parliament, commemorating the 85th Anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine-Genocide.
#Holodomor is a reminder of the value of democracy. The truth about the famine was suppressed by the totalitarian Soviet regime. One of the advantages of democracy is that there are more ways for the truth to be brought out, and fewer barriers to overcome. https://t.co/JUUKM6rMgj

Today, Rep. @BillPascrell &amp; I testified before the U.S. ITC. I warned them that the failure to rectify the basic flaw in &amp; the major source of controversy over #NAFTA 25 years ago will jeopardize #USMCA support from the new House Democratic majority | https://t.co/0ciQF7BYo1 https://t.co/GwpaIsI2B0
This has been calculated to save $1.4 billion annually by the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services. I have introduced H.R. 5150, the Protecting Medicare from Excessive Price Increases Act, which would establish such a program in Part B.
A better way to address growth in Part B drug prices would be to follow a recommendations by the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to require drug manufacturers to provide rebates to Medicare when the price of their drug increases faster than inflation.
Moreover, changes to Part B could shift more costs onto seniors and in some cases may jeopardize access to chemotherapy for cancer patients.
This will likely have only a modest impact on overall Medicare spending and will do next to nothing to force drug companies to limit growth in the cost of their drugs.
Instead, the Administration has put forth a package that addresses relatively narrow issues in Part B while completely ignoring the rapid growth in the Part D program.
Pres. Trump again failed to call for basic reforms that meaningfully cut prescription drug prices, e.g. allowing seniors to import lower cost medications from Canada or to allow Medicare to directly negotiate w/drug manufacturers, despite his repeated campaign promises to do so.
Trump issued guidance allowing insurance providers to avoid covering pre-existing conditions &amp; get federal subsidies to do it, threatening affordable coverage for +4 million in MI alone - our family, friends, &amp; neighbors &amp; millions more across the country! https://t.co/1jNGM7t3M9

Congressional Republicans have failed to deliver on President Trump’s campaign promises to cut prescription drug costs by not working with Democrats to produce comprehensive solutions that get at the root causes of the problem.
The GOP majority has prevented votes on bills to reduce cost growth for Medicare Part B drugs, allow Medicare to negotiate lower Part D drug prices, &amp; allow patients to import cheaper medicines from Canada. https://t.co/K1RNImL9HG

I'm proud to join +100 of my colleagues on the #ExpandSocialSecurity Caucus. These are benefits you've earned. It's an insurance program, not an entitlement. It protects our seniors, survivors, &amp; the disabled. We must strengthen what works, &amp; not allow the Republicans to gut it.
Since the Republican tax law was signed, wages are not keeping up with inflation, health care costs are rising, and companies are spending much of their returns on stock buy backs while others are shipping jobs overseas. The second #GOPTaxScam is more of the same failed policies.
Today, I spoke from the House Floor today calling my colleagues to advance a resolution I introduced last week which condemns efforts to suppress information related to the ethnic cleansing being perpetrated against #Rohingya minority in Burma. https://t.co/aG3sUS79Go
It is within her power to free two reporters imprisoned for revealing the truth about the treatment of the #Rohingya and the House of Representatives should call on her to exercise that authority.
I met personally with Aung San Suu Kyi a few years ago and was inspired by her story of not only perseverance but triumph over oppression.  It is vital for Suu Kyi to openly address the brutal repression of Burma’s #Rohingya Muslims.
Today, I introduced a resolution calling on Burma’s civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, to release two journalists sentenced to 7 years in prison for violating state secrets laws after reporting on atrocities committed against #Rohingya Muslims. https://t.co/Gkg6sGJRIp
In July (https://t.co/FNLZ4pRtRr) the Franklin-Bingham and Sterling Heights Fire Departments and in August (https://t.co/G0C8jJazFz) the Roseville and Fraser Fire Departments also were awarded SAFER grants.
The importance of these grants cannot be overstated and it is why I continue to support robust funding for this program in Congress. They help ensure that our fire departments get the personnel, equipment, and training necessary to keep our communities safe.
I am happy to announce that the Madison Heights Fire Department was just awarded a Dept. of Homeland Security grant through the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) - Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program. https://t.co/KguGwW1No9
Based on earlier discussions &amp; information available today, there is no such assurance that this core issue will be adequately addressed. Unless it is, I don't believe that there will any significant Democratic support for the revised #NAFTA, most likely necessary for its passage
A revised #NAFTA must assure that this pivotal issue be effectively addressed. The Administration has not consulted effectively with Congress or shared the existing text.
Two groups of workers - independent union vs. CTM-controlled - highlight the need for labor reform in Mexico which, under #NAFTA, has maintained a policy of suppressing industrial wages/worker rights resulting in outsourced U.S. jobs. and lower U.S. wages. https://t.co/AVz9LoxzXA https://t.co/Y2K0lOqTBI
Earlier this year, Reps. Pascrell, DeLauro, &amp; I - along w/ +180 House Democrats - reminded the Trump Administration failing to directly address this problem w/ enforceable measures leaves intact a system that promotes outsourcing &amp; harms American wages https://t.co/SL50VqBDWT
I strongly urge the Administration to stay at the bargaining table as long as it takes to ensure a good deal for America’s workers, and to consult with Congress as required by law.
After today’s announcement that the U.S. and Mexico have come to an agreement on a revised #NAFTA, it remains highly unclear whether there will be assured, substantial change in the status quo on this key issue.
Meeting just now with a group of workers in Mexico who were fired from their jobs in a tire factory after they went on strike to protest wages of less than $2 an hour made it crystal clear how far Mexico still has to go to ensure real labor rights.
If a rewrite of #NAFTA fails to forcefully and directly address [suppressed labor rights &amp; wages in Mexico], the result will just be more downward pressure on American workers’ wages and outsourcing of U.S. jobs to very low-wage Mexico. https://t.co/PZb2ka2Hge
We hope our trip will further illuminate the essential importance of this issue, especially as negotiations over #NAFTA have reached a critical juncture.
Any new #NAFTA cannot address this critical problem indirectly or with half measures. It must tear down this long-standing structure now embedded in many thousands of so-called protection contracts, which were signed with no real input from or knowledge by workers.
Mexico's industrial policy of keeping wages low by suppressing workers' rights has led to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs, while also keeping Mexican workers from rising to the middle class.

Very few families with modest incomes can afford the high out-of-pocket expenses required in order to participate in an HSA.
Expanding HSAs and shifting more Americans into catastrophic coverage, as H.R. 6311 does, will not meaningfully help middle-class families harmed by Republican sabotage of the ACA. Instead, it will primarily benefit wealthy Americans and large insurance companies…

The more the American people learn about the Republican tax bill, the more they will reject it, just as every Democrat did today on the Committee on Ways and Means. 4/4
Speaker Ryan has said the bill is focused on the middle class, but that is simply not true. It’s really the opposite: it’s a bill built for millionaires. And the process used to consider it has been driven by desperation, rather than deliberation. 3/
While the GOP bill gives the very wealthy enormous tax breaks, it actually raises taxes on tens of millions of middle-class families by eliminating the personal exemption and deductions for medical expenses, for full state and local taxes, and for educational needs. 2/
The Republican tax bill picks winners and losers – the big winners are the very wealthy and some corporations, and the losers are the middle class and those who aspire to it, and the rest of America who will be forced to pay for the bill’s massive debt for years to come.  1/

In total, abt 1 MILLION Michiganders have health insurance thx to #ACA, thru exchange or Healthy MI.

#Medicaid covers nearly 6 in 10 of all long-term care (nursing home) stays. We can't let GOP threaten that guarantee.
MI #Medicaid expansion, Healthy Michigan, has brought health insurance to 671,000 in our state and millions more nationwide.
.@USCBO found in yrs past that #Medicare voucher plan could nearly double premiums for those left on traditional pgm https://t.co/e8Vcn2wAu4

On the 52nd anniv. of #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid, I'm committed as ever to fighting against #GOP efforts to slash benefits
As we mark 52nd Anniv. of #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid, we must work to protect them from drastic changes like the ones proposed by repeal of #ACA
For each of repeal plans being debated, #Trumpcare means… -Soaring premiums -Fewer options -Millions of families without coverage

No matter your ideology, cutting HC is the wrong RX for America. Read my full op-ed here https://t.co/e8Vcn2OblC via @detroitnews
Regrettably, GOP vision for health care consistently focuses on cutting assistance for Americans: Medicare, Medicaid, or repealing #ACA.
Our focus should be on supporting and strengthening Medicare, not undermining. 57M Americans depend on it — including nearly 2M in MI.
Medicare vouchers are  unpopular. 2015 poll found that 70% support keeping Medicare as it is, only 25% support shifting to voucher
GOP claims current seniors would be exempt from change, but once basic guarantee of Medicare eliminated for some, it's at risk for all
This attack on benefits for seniors is particularly misguided in a budget designed to pave way for huge tax breaks for wealthy &amp; lrg corps.
Last week @HouseGOP passed in committee a budget that would replace guarantee of Medicare w/ a voucher &amp; cut Medicare $487B over 10yrs.
While GOP might gut Medicaid w/ #Trumpcare, House GOP Budget includes instructions to end Medicare as we know it https://t.co/uoyfJl30z7

Happy Birthday @freep! Thanks for all your years of covering the news of the day and key issues for metro Detroit. https://t.co/hP8uxOSsag
It's an honor to represent you. Be assured of my continued opposition to #Trumpcare and other harmful proposals. https://t.co/S7cqSvYFgU
Today, @HouseGOP turned their backs on the health needs of millions and millions of Americans.  My full stmt here → https://t.co/aiBdOX7WOY
The Upton &amp; other amendments to #Trumpcare make a bad bill worse. Fewer covered. Higher costs. Fewer protections.
.@HouseGOP promised no one would lose coverage under #TrumpCare, but nonpartisan @USCBO says 24 million Americans would lose coverage. https://t.co/rayH5pZ8ob
High risk pools don’t guarantee coverage; frequently included long waiting lists, limited cvg/exclusions, &amp; v. hi premiums. #ProtectOurCare
.@RepPaulMitchell I'll take you up on that offer. Why don't you join me @ Macomb Henry Ford Hosp. for their health summit tmr?
Roughly 129 million Americans are living with pre-existing conditions. Under #Trumpcare, they will pay more for cvg if they can get it
The American Medical Association has said on history of high risk pools: those w/ pre-existing conditions will be stuck w/ 2nd class cvg
I share your concern; I will be voting no on #Trumpcare bc it guts $$ for Medicaid, protections for pre-existing conditions, &amp; much more https://t.co/tkNUYnhtXd
#Trumpcare threatens coverage for pre-existing conditions - like mental health, maternal care, emergency room visits. Unacceptable.

It's a little hard to tax the sun. https://t.co/mUINrrf3oG
Ice cream does not have the same impact that scientists have found from tanning.
It is really unfortunate &amp; sad that we're taking up this bill in this way, w/o single hearing on this bill so that people can raise issues.
The ideology: Get rid of taxes regardless. The regardless is the lives of many people that are at stake.
There's no golden eggs that come out of these tanning salons. To lose $600M because of this, really raises Qs about the recklessness.
I'm sure there are jobs involved w the tanning tax, but the basic issue is health. Evidence is clear: tanning can be a source of cancer.
Nothing is more important than one's health care. Nothing. And to minimize it is a mistake.
When it's said ACA is anecdotes - no it isn't. It's the lives of millions who have benefited from ACA.
ACA brought insurance to 20M ppl, the insurance rate went down dramatically. Ppl no longer have to fear illness bc they don't have insurance
