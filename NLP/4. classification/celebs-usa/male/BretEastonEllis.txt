Really liked GREEN BOOK. Made my top 10 of 2018. It's a comedy first, ideology second. It shouldn't work but does. Two of the best performances of the year: Ali, Mortensen. Progressive's who find this innocuous movie racist are part of the problem in the current cultural divide. https://t.co/b6mMSb0Jet

Ari Aster's HEREDITARY is not only the movie of the year but one of the scariest, most upsetting horror movies ever made--a true freak-out. It's a great debut, novelistic in scope and a polarizing, brilliant, beautiful nightmare. Toni Collette and Alex Wolff are magnificent. https://t.co/NUtMWkgMet

Glasgow, winter 1973, two teenagers shot dead, police force silenced by the wealthy, a young detective dares to investigate. BLOODY JANUARY by Alan Parks, a Scottish-noir crime-procedural: really tight writing, gripping and violent, dark and satisfying. I flew through it quickly. https://t.co/LFIRlJoyu4
LOVE, SIMON and MY FRIEND DAHMER: two recent gay-themed high-school movies, one ends on a Ferris Wheel with two boys kissing while friends cheer below; the other ends with the murder of a hitchhiker by a murderous teen. One feels like liberal fantasy. One feels like awful truth. https://t.co/OmA6c5yt6G

Randomly watched Bob Clark's DEATHDREAM, also known as DEAD OF NIGHT. Fascinating low-budget mid-70s horror about a young soldier back from Vietnam (yes, undead and a vampire) dealing with his family and having a murderous breakdown. A prime piece of 1974 horror. Kind of awesome. https://t.co/2YYxpxpdW3

@Karaszewski It's good.
The DGA Nominations: GET OUT, LADY BIRD and THE SHAPE OF WATER are actually better directed movies than Paul Thomas Anderson's PHANTOM THREAD?!? Or is ideology trumping aesthetics? I hope not. https://t.co/1xaKSLD8S6
This kind of ideology is another example of how people don't care about movies or art anymore. Movies should only be made by a PC democracy! It will hopefully not take years for a generation to rid itself of this kind of mindless, regressive, identity politics groupthink. Resist. https://t.co/LN4xGYkMnY

@RodLurie I think you might be right or...I think we are heading toward a Richard Burton vs. Richard Dreyfuss upset from 1978.
@RodLurie Thanks RL. I think Chalamet gave the performance of 2017 but AMPAS members I've talked to aren't into the movie. They seem to love Disaster Artist so I think it's a showdown between Oldman-Franco with Franco actually having an edge because they find Darkest Hour kind of boring.
@RobLowe @Sethrogen Actually, he'd better get the Oscar. IMO.

Just watched SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER for the first time since January 1978 when I was 13. It has aged better than ever. A key 70s movie: crude and messy, sexy and profane; a completely hypnotic, ecstatic experience. John Travolta: amazing. Nothing today compares. https://t.co/urYoemsiGW

"A picture's beauty does not depend on the things portrayed in it..." Marcel Proust.
There might be flaws in BIRDMAN but it's the most audacious, interesting, self-conscious, entertaining, tragic and funniest movie of 2014.
Inarritu finally nails it with BIRDMAN: wildly over-the-top entertaining and Keaton gives the greatest performance of the year. Wins Oscar.

When Louie finally tanked: "fat girl" episode which took everything great about the show and turned it into the worst Facebook thread ever.
The 27-year-old would rather look at cat pics than watch Marathon Man or the fat girl episode of Louie. I agree with him on the latter. Ugh.

Disney defines its brand with SAVING MR. BANKS. The Studio: is right about everything. Writers: crazy people who need to be told what to do.
The first 45 minutes of Spike Jonze's HER is the best movie of the year. The following 75 minutes are not.
Favorite lyric from "Frozen" is when Anna sings: "For years I've roamed these empty halls/Why have a ballroom with no balls?" Yes. Indeed.

"I like a moral problem so much better than a real problem." Elaine May.
I really liked THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE. Even when it kind of stumbles it's still the best American movie I've seen this fall.
"Now, that's someone I love! And you I don't even like! You got an assignment, cheapie: find my money!" Marty Augustine in The Long Goodbye.
Everyone involved with PHILOMENA should know better (and they do!): Steve Coogan, Stephen Frears, The Weinstein's, Judi Dench, U.S. critics.

It's now the 12th of November and the best American movie released so far this year is still Richard Linklater's BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
BRING UP THE BODIES is a smoother, faster read than WOLF HALL, even though there are seven introductory pages reminding us who everyone is.
"Each time I have tried to communicate with someone, love has disappeared…" Michelangelo Antonioni, La Notte.
Antonioni's great film LA NOTTE (1961) is one of the few things that Don Draper ever admits to actually liking in "Mad Men" so far.
Just re-watched Michelangelo Antonioni's amazing LA NOTTE. A great film and one of Stanley Kubrick's top-ten favorite movies of all time.
Kenneth Lonergan's MARGARET is a masterpiece. Anna Paquin and Jeannie Berlin give legendary performances. The death scene is bloodcurdling.
The worst thing I noticed about this last Halloween: American morons who got wildly offended and pissed-off by, um, yep: Halloween costumes.
THE CANYONS opens in Italy on November 14th. Here's the slightly more explicit Italian trailer: http://t.co/LWgyqlSIgt
Halloween costume: the 27-year-old is going as Sandra Bullock's vengeful, unforgiving dead daughter in GRAVITY, rooting for mom to drown...
There's so much self-righteous hatred aimed at THE COUNSELOR because it dares to laugh darkly at the "Victims Are Our New Heroes" culture...
I liked the bloody feel-bad nihilism of Ridley Scott's THE COUNSELOR, a much-needed rejoinder to "noble" and "humanistic" movies everywhere.
I'll be with artist Luc Tuymans at The Menil Collection in Houston on Tuesday October 29 6-7pm. A conversation and book-signing.

Why remake one of the greatest American movies of the 1970s? CARRIE 2013 was the most depressing filmgoing experience I've had this year...
This is one of the best things I've ever read about Brian DePalma's CARRIE and why certain movies change you: http://t.co/oNKsP3y1zZ via @EW
The basic story in any movie is always, again and again and again and again, about one thing: loneliness.
I've been thinking about the painful and nightmarish images from "12 Years a Slave" all day. Impressed but conflicted. Very troubling movie.
I'm reading the wonderful "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" by Ben Fountain as slowly as I can because I don't want it to end.
With its constant fetishization of brutality "12 Years a Slave" is grim and powerful but because of the subject matter it also feels rigged.
Parts of "12 Years a Slave" are very powerful but why did it seem like "Mandingo" for the guilty-liberal, show-biz, art-conscious crowd?
"If you can't make fun of bad movies on serious subjects, what's the point?" Pauline Kael on being a film critic.
"I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is a shame, two is a law firm, and three or more is a congress..." John Adams.
Being acknowledged in Joan Didion's acceptance speech at PEN last night was very moving because she's the writer who means the most to me...
At the PEN dinner in L.A. honoring the great Joan Didion, the writer who has influenced me the most and the writer I most love. Emotional...
"Dogs are loyal, yes, but to us, not to other dogs..." Karl Kraus
What's so bad about American movies now is that they're overcome with righteousness. Decency has replaced everything interesting about them.

The sentimental hatred for me has made me want to re-read Munro, who I never really got, because now I feel like I've beaten-up Santa Claus.
Today's horoscope: Emotionally you are a sea creature. You have no fear of the deep waters; it's the shallow water that gives you a fright.

Alice Munro is so completely overrated.

Today I watched Max Ophuls amazing "The Earrings of Madame De..." (1953) and was even more depressed by the current state of American film.
Happy about Matt Smith in AMERICAN PSYCHO: THE MUSICAL but I also liked the idea of runner-up Andrew Rannells in the role. Maybe Broadway...
KILL YOUR DARLINGS made me conflicted about: The Beats in general, adolescent narcissism in Queer Cinema, actors playing Kerouac, being gay.
139 pages into "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" by Ben Fountain. The best fiction I've read in a long time. A total pleasure. Loving it...

"GRAVITY celebrates humanity by reducing the spectrum of human life to a narrow consensus of decency..." Richard Brody, The New Yorker.
"GRAVITY flatters the studious humanism of critics who honor the attention to so-called reality..." Richard Brody, The New Yorker.
"GRAVITY involves a far more menacing emptiness than the physical void of outer space: the absence of ideas." Richard Brody, The New Yorker.
"It's hard to recall a movie that's as viscerally exciting and as deadly boring as GRAVITY..." Richard Brody, The New Yorker.

The only things I took from GRAVITY: I want George Clooney's ghost to give me pep talks, and maybe they shouldn't allow chicks in space.

GRAVITY is technically brilliant but it's totally boring in just about every other aspect. It has become the most overrated movie of 2013...
"Hollywood is the only place where you can die of encouragement..." Pauline Kael.
One of the biggest problems with American movies now is that they demand too much of our sympathy.
The blind auditions on THE VOICE are probably the most emotionally stirring and suspenseful episodes on television right now. Deal with it.

The August 8th 1970 New York Times review of Joan Didion's PLAY IT AS IT LAYS ends with the line "a bad novel by a very good writer." Hmmm.
Yes, guys: RIDDICK is a much better movie than THE BUTLER by a long shot.
Catfish: Another fat Millennial opens a door. Handsome and bangable Nev stares semi-impassively. I'm always near tears. Best show on TV?
Saw "YOU'RE NEXT" today. I could only think: it's a better movie than "THE BUTLER" and Joe Swanberg's performance in it is totally terrific.
Most intense cinematic experience of 2013: watching Thom Andersen's nearly 3 hour LOS ANGELES PLAYS ITSELF on an iPad, on YouTube, outside.
This is Donna Tartt's best novel. It's nearly 800 pages long and I've been savoring it for over a month. Inspiring. http://t.co/bU9exg5QRV
Yet again disgusted by the dumbed-down culture we live in: grown adults whining like babies about "spoilers" in movies and TV. MAN UP, guys.
Let me lose more followers: in GRAVITY Sandra Bullock is saddled with backstory of dead kid and George Clooney's ghost gives her a pep talk.
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN: Spectacular and thrilling and charismatic and psychedelic, it makes the good movies now look like dogshit. Or am I old?
ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW: the post-Empire future. A prankster's wet-dream you root for but everything cool about it goes totally off the rails.
THE WORLD'S END: The 27-year-old said he's too young to get it but the overall metaphor resonated with me even though I barely laughed once.
AIN'T THEM BODIES SAINTS: Love Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Rooney Mara but it confirms the solemnity of its title in about 15 deadly minutes.
GRAVITY: completely interminable and lacking in suspense because it's so seriously miscast. Do you REALLY think Sandra Bullock is gonna die?
Last 5 Films Seen: ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW, GRAVITY, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, THE WORLD'S END, AIN'T THEM BODIES SAINTS. I only really liked one...
2013 is undeniably, so far, the worst year ever for American movies.
IN THE REIGN OF THE GAY MAGICAL ELVES by BRET EASTON ELLIS | Out Magazine: http://t.co/t2eiiEq6pg
While in Italy for the Venice 70th International Film Festival the person I became most obsessed with is the rap star MORENO via MTV Italy.
When E.L. James asked me who I thought should be Christian I said "James Deen, of course" and then she shoved me. We were both very wasted.
E.L. James and I were at Rob Pattinson's house when she admitted that Rob was first choice for Christian. Ian Somerhalder never in running.
Talked to E.L. James at a party over the summer: her first choice for Christian was Rob Pattinson and Matt Bomer was never in the running.
Surreal moment at the Venice International Film Festival: James Deen is mobbed by teenage girls while Silvio Berlusconi sits ten feet away.
Lindsay flaked.
At the 70th Venice International Film Festival for the European premiere of THE CANYONS, walking around the Lido with James Deen and Stoya.
Joe Swanberg's DRINKING BUDDIES on VOD: riveted for 90 minutes. The culmination of everything he's done and one of the best movies of 2013.

PACIFIC RIM is the second most beautiful movie I've seen in 2013. Don't get me started on Victimization Cinema and FRUITVALE STATION. Argh.
Nicolas Winding Refn's ONLY GOD FORGIVES is the most visually amazing yet narratively frustrating movie of 2013. This goes hand-in-hand now?
James Wan's "The Conjuring" is okay. Maybe better than okay at times. But it's basically okay. Way too many "Boo!" moments but they're okay.

Reading: "NW" by Zadie Smith..."My Lunches With Orson" by Peter Biskind... "The Goldfinch" by Donna Tartt...
Don't get me started on "Fruitvale Station"...
If I really thought about it: Yeah, I have a problem that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev made the cover of Rolling Stone but The Replacements never did.
Moronic outrage over Rolling Stone's Tsamaev cover is a depressing reminder of what a baby-sensitive and dumbed-down culture we've become...
The current American love affair with the cult of victimization is part of a childish sentimental narrative that is enveloping all of us...
The Rolling Stone cover of a dreamy Dzhokhar Tsamaev is shocking and effective. It works. It's relevant. This is the face of terrorism.
"Laurence Olivier is very--I mean, seriously--stupid. I believe that intelligence is a handicap in an actor..." Orson Welles.
And I'm watching "Big Brother After Dark"...
Okay: I started "My Lunches With Orson" by Peter Biskend an hour ago and I already know that I'm not going to sleep tonight. It's amazing...
For those who asked me: the music in THE CANYONS trailer is "Love, French, Better" by @GOLD_ZEBRA and "22 My Other Girl" by Brian Randazzo.

"Bret, do you want an Adderall?" the video director asked me while I was doing the voiceover for brilliant new Placebo clip...
Mad Men is so spellbinding that even though Season 6 is its weakest season it's still by far one of the best shows on television ever aired.
As someone who loved American movies: at some point in 2013 I realized that they were probably dead as an art form. I am late to the game.
I've just watched the first two brilliant episodes of Mad Men Season 6. Um, what are the problems? Better than any movies I've seen in 2013.

The worst and most painful and wounding relationship I ever had was with someone who was an idealized version of myself.
Edward Snowden is one of the more attractive people I've come across this week.
Best book I've read this year is a remarkable novel by John Williams called STONER. It isn't about drugs but it's about everything else...
What is the thing I hate the most? The consummate dishonest team-player who ends up being so guarded that he's just another boring observer.
The great movie stars have to have some hint of not liking themselves or else their plan doesn't work.
The greatest filmmakers show an indifference to reality, even a disdain to its restraints.
I love James Franco. I really do. And I always have.
Reading: "A Hologram For The King" by Dave Eggers. "Antonia Lively Breaks the Silence" by David Samuel Levinson. "Stoner" by John Williams.
SALON MISLEADS. I never "interviewed" Matthew Specktor for Salon. We had a conversation. He taped it. He transcribed it. Heads up everyone.
The last thirty minutes of Justin Lin's "The Fast &amp; The Furious 6" has one of the greatest and most crazily exciting chase scenes ever shot.
In the middle of what might be one of the great unheralded 20th-century American novels: "Stoner" (1965) by John Williams. Almost perfect...
Matt Damon is "the finest" actor; Frances Ha is "the best" movie; The Fast &amp; The Furious 6 has "the most exciting" chase in years. Etc, etc.
The Best. The Most. The Greatest. The Funniest. The Scariest. The Sexiest. Yes, this is the teenager in me. Yes, this is the hack in me...
Matt Damon in "Behind the Candelabra" proves that he is the finest actor of his generation but the role is not as crucial as his Ripley...
Not thrilled with this minor piece but told NUVO Magazine I'd mention it anyway: http://t.co/pPVgx7Bng2 Oh, Canada. Really?

For those who keep asking me what all the fuss is about in The Sex Scene that they've heard about from GLAMORAMA, okay, go to pages 334-340.
I seriously liked Noah Baumbach's gorgeous FRANCES HA. Greta Gerwig might be the best actress of her generation. Favorite 2013 movie so far.
Watched George Cukor's masterpiece "A Star Is Born" (1954): not only one of the best films made about Hollywood but also a great noir movie.

Many questions about American Psycho the musical that I don't have the answers for. Go to @APtheMusical #americanpsycho More news tomorrow.
After GLAAD banned me they told the friend who was bringing me to the event to WARN "Bret not to go public or TWEET about this decision..."
It's GLAAD's party and they can invite whoever they want, but as the guest of someone invited who was told today she can't bring me, well...
GLAAD is supposedly "furious" about my tweets. And I'm guessing not the ones concerning my boyfriend or how sexy I think Adam Driver is...
As a gay man in a domestic partnership who plans to get married I'm sad to hear I've been banned by GLAAD from attending tomorrow's event...
The American Psycho musical premieres this December in London but don't ask me how it is because I haven't seen it yet.#PatrickBatemanLive
Reading a new novel by a writer who is obviously writing for posterity without understanding the fact that posterity doesn't exist anymore.
The only possible way to find any meaning or relevance in "42" is to watch it as the first large-scale Hollywood movie about Barack Obama...

Sitting through "Trance" tonight I wondered: what are the reasons that have hindered Danny Boyle from ever making a good and coherent movie?
The new "serious" Evil Dead is disastrously literal-minded. The giddy rain of blood sequence is a nice try but overall: an annoying remake.
The Not Exactly Terrible But Very Disappointing 2013 Movies so far: Spring Breakers, The Place Beyond The Pines, Side Effects, Phil Spector.
The 2013 Walkouts so far: Oz the Great and Powerful, Stoker, A Good Day To Die Hard, A Glimpse Into the Mind of Charles Swan the III...
Best movies of 2013 so far: Reality (Italy, Garrone), 56 Up (UK, Michael Apted), Like Someone In Love (Abbas Kiarostami), Room 237 (Ascher).
After watching the delirious Room 237 I realized that the worst thing happening to movies was the empowerment of the viewer via technology.
Absence means the most.

Watching Stanley Kubrick's endlessly fascinating The Shining tonight I'm not sure if we collectively willed a problem movie into greatness.
Matteo Garrone's "Reality" is the funniest and most visually stunning film I've seen so far in 2013. A problem movie but also ravishing...
For some reason while grinning through the adolescent jingoism of Olympus Has Fallen I realized I liked it a lot more than Zero Dark Thirty.

In a new memoir Tom Sizemore accuses me of "denying" that I "stole" his cocaine. Well, I remember taking it but I don't remember denying it.
The new James Salter novel "All That Is" contains the most beautiful prose I've read in years. He's maybe the last great American stylist...
Adam Driver is without a doubt the sexiest man on television.
GIRLS: it's Adam Driver's episode and he has never been more powerfully messed-up. He's absolutely haunting all the way through. Fearless.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Mirrors" by Justin Timberlake.
Movies of the Romanian New Wave are so torturous. Latest ordeal: "Beyond the Hills" by the exemplary writer/director Cristian Mungiu. Ugh.
Why don't they just let Justin Timberlake host every week?

Chris Ware's "Building Stories" is a once-in-a-lifetime reading experience that makes you change your mind about the future of fiction...
The impishly handsome and alive-to-the-moment Alden Ehrenreich is one of the only reasons to sit through bad movies in 2013.
Abbas Kiarostami's "Like Someone In Love" is the best new movie playing around right now. Gorgeous and hypnotic, it takes you by surprise...
When someone complains that a movie is "completely devoid of emotion" can't they understand that numbness is a legitimate feeling as well?

In order to become a great artist of any kind you have to be completely open to the idea of totally deluding yourself. Logic means nothing.
"The Last Resort" at the end of The Eagles "Hotel California" is the ultimate L.A. Boomer lament; it's a song even Ronald Reagan could love.
The Eagles "Hotel California" album for better or worse is the grand apex of self-pittying Boomer rock. Every track is a sonic masterpiece.
The Eagles were the epitome of Baby Boomer narcissism which is what made them totally great for a few years and then totally irrelevant...
The Eagles. Sigh. Just watched all three hours of the new doc. There isn't another American band that I'm more conflicted about. Depressed.
"There is nothing more absurd than properly motivated characters..." Walter Hill.

WAKE IN FRIGHT (1971): "It left me speechless"-Martin Scorsese. "The best and most terrifying film about Australia in existence"-Nick Cave.
The hypnotic "Wake in Fright" (from 1971, Australia) isn't a horror film exactly but the notorious kangaroo sequence left me shell-shocked.
Trainer who finds GIRLS "impossible" gives up. He sighs to everything I rave about Lena/Hannah with: "Um, good for her, um, good for her."
After watching the last episode of GIRLS again I'm convinced it was one of the best-written TV shows I've ever seen.
Main topic for most of the day with everyone I talked to: GIRLS Season 2 Episode 5. Love/hate? Brilliant/absurd? Patrick Wilson followed me.
Part of me wishes that Patrick Wilson had asked Hannah, "Who's Fiona Apple?"...
A realist movie about common relatable experience, there are few films that have the intense comic-obsessiveness of SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.
GIRLS: the almost unbearable pathos and honesty of the last two episodes makes everything else on TV seem like something we need to forget.
GIRLS: whether the Lena Dunham/Patrick Wilson hookup is "fiction" "wish-fulfillment" or "unrealistic" does not matter. It breaks new ground.
GIRLS: Lena Dunham's fuck you to anyone who thinks Hannah's not conventionally attractive enough to have sex with Patrick Wilson is awesome.

ARGO is nice and all that but SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is seriously crazy and modern and genre defining. The best rom-com of the last decade.
WOLF HALL is "better" than FIFTY SHADES OF GREY but which one did I get through in a day? Which one took me two weeks to get to page 277?
WOLF HALL should've been called PRONOUN HELL. Any book where you have to keep referencing the FIVE PAGES of CAST OF CHARACTERS is a problem.
David Shields: an indispensable writer whose new book How Literature Saved My Life is brilliant. Also recommended: his great Reality Hunger.
Frank Ocean's "Channel Orange" is the version of "Less Than Zero" I would have written if I was an incredibly talented and chill musician...
Corey Stoll in "House of Cards" and Ryan Gosling in "Gangster Squad" give my two favorite performances so far in 2013. Yes, it's February...
House of Cards: David Fincher's cold, malevolent mastery with completely unlikeable characters makes the first two hours utterly hypnotic...
Tonight: Terrence Malick's glorious "Days of Heaven" (1978) on a huge screen at the Cinerama Dome had the packed house absolutely in awe...
The dance-sequence in Silver Linings Playbook is as important to the rom-com as Diane Keaton singing Seems Like Old Times is to Annie Hall.

SAG Awards Favorite moment at E! On the Red Carpet: Jennifer Lawrence demolishing the E! MANICAM with her "fat" fingers while growling...
Have to admit I'm baffled that Argo wins Best Ensemble Acting at the SAG Awards over Silver Linings Playbook. A very curious Awards Season.
After the SAG Awards tonight: will reevaluate Silver Linings Playbook upcoming chances. If it has to lose to something I'm fine with Argo...
GIRLS: Episode 3 (Season 2). Brilliant. Hilarious. Hannah's savage monologue to Marnie was genius. Funniest use of a Duncan Sheik song ever.

Oscars 2013: "Silver Linings Playbook"--Best Picture, Director, Actress, Supporting Actor.
Oscars 2013: Or it's a replay from Saving Private Ryan vs Shakespeare in Love and Steve wins yet SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK takes Best Picture.
Oscars 2013: Ang Lee deserves Best Director more than anyone but since that's not going to happen I think it's between SS and Russell...
Oscars 2013: Affleck will win the DGA hands down. The Oscar vote for director is between "Lincoln" and "Silver Linings Playbook" and I think
Oscar 2013: Directors. A race between Spielberg and Russell. Are they going to give SS a THIRD Oscar? Or give Russell the award he deserves?
I actually think Silver Linings Playbook will sweep the Oscars on February 24th considering the Academy voters I've talked to. Just a fact.
"Lincoln" and "Zero Dark Thirty" are both vaguely Republican which is why "Silver Linings Playbook" will win the Oscar for Best Picture...
In Zero Dark Thirty Oscar ads Jessica Chastain says "We all remember where we were when Osama Bin Laden was killed." Um, no, babe, we don't.
Tonight: my 70 year-old mom and step-dad drink Cosmos at Hamburger Hamlet in Sherman Oaks making "Amour" jokes: "Bring. Me. The. Pillow."
I wish people would stop taking the standardly "controversial" and boringly negative route with THE CANYONS. It's actually a good movie...
The noble solemnity of "Lincoln" and "Zero Dark Thirty" annoy me to no end compared to the relevant craziness of "Silver Linings Playbook".
I watched "Amour" again and I still think it's so sadistic that it is the movie Hitler would have made if he had directed "On Golden Pond".
But the "silliness" of the ending of "Silver Linings Playbook" ties in with Pat's tirade against the ending of Hemingway and oh forget it...
Am I alone in thinking that Brian De Palma's Dressed To Kill is better than any of the movies nominated for Best Picture Oscar's this year?
Listening to Oneohtrix Point Never's "Replica" while heading toward The Guitar Center on Sunset to buy the 26 year-old a Yeti microphone...
Second episode of "Girls" (Season Two) confirms that it's the best show on television. Just absolutely beautifully written, acted and shot.
I watched "Silver Linings Playbook" again tonight and I'm even more convinced that it's a better, more relevant movie than "Lincoln"...

Jodie Foster speech: doesn't really come out, brags about being 50, kills off her mother, celebrated by the LBGT community for coming out...
Jodie Foster says "I want all of the good stuff and none of the bad stuff!" What is she? A three year-old lesbian?
Jodie Foster was drunk.
The Hollywood hypocrisy is complete: Jodie Foster accepts her Lifetime Achievement award at The GG's and then demands PUBLIC PRIVACY...
What is everybody talking about? Didn't I just hear Jodie Foster fake a coming out speech? I've never heard the word PRIVACY said so loudly.
Apologies to Andrew Rannells for anything negative I said about The New Normal. He's really great and fearless on Girls. Is it the writing?
Wait, after Claire Danes speech: I'm confused. Is Damien Lewis's mother upstairs at The Beverly Hilton as well?
GG's: You really can't make fun of a show where Kirsten Wiig and Will Farrell already did the job for you, brilliantly.
I don't believe #ERedCarpet advocates torture but the way they approach the material one could easily think this was true. Mani Cam must go.
I don't believe the makers of Zero Dark Thirty advocate torture but the way they approach the material one could easily think this was true.

Love that Silver Linings Playbook grabs the audience by the lapels and shrieks Feel! Feel! Feel! (sob) Feel! Feel! (sob) Feel! (sob). FEEL!
"Silver Linings Playbook" is a benchmark in the development of the romantic comedy the same way "Annie Hall" was over thirty years ago...
Silver Linings Playbook. Jennifer Lawrence: a no-brainer for Best Actress. And the same goes for Robert De Niro for Best Supporting Actor.
The Academy should GET that what Cooper did in creating an original character is more impressive than what Day Lewis had to impersonate...
Beasts of the Southern Wild is even more overrated than Zero Dark Thirty which makes it the most overrated movie of 2012. BEST ACTRESS? WTF?
Daniel Day Lewis has won TWO Oscars already. Are they really going to give him a THIRD for Lincoln? Bradley Cooper should win it hands down.
Daniel Day Lewis: his noble theatricality is no match for the wild and fearless go-for-broke craziness that Bradley Cooper brought to SLP...
2-man race between Lewis and Cooper. Will The Academy give Lewis a 3rd Oscar or give it to Cooper for most original performance of the year?
The huge support from the acting branch of The Academy for "Silver Linings Playbook" is a key indicator of where things fall on Oscar night.
The Oscar Noms reveal it's really a race between "Lincoln" and "Silver Linings Playbook" and I think "Silver Linings Playbook" has the edge.
No. Comment. "Here Is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie" http://t.co/CDktTYK7
Bored. Writing. What I'm really thinking about? How great Tom Holland was in the otherwise meh movie The Impossible and what does that mean?

I'm shy.
I don't know what it says about me but I find both Nick and Amy Dunne in Gillian Flynn's novel "Gone Girl" totally sympathetic characters...
Today yet again someone makes a Dorsia joke to me. I always cringe and smile and play along.
DGA: Lee should get it. Affleck comes in second. Spielberg and Bigelow: meh. Tom Hooper: WTF? Where's David O. Russell? Hunch: Affleck wins.
The new holier-than-thou Oscar ads for Zero Dark Thirty. Angels sing while: "A lot of my friends died trying to do this," Maya cries. Ugh...
Saw "Searching For Sugar Man" and even though it was a little Sugar-Coated it's the best doc from 2012. And the music: it's really amazing.

Best Picture 2012: "Silver Linings Playbook"....
Best of 2012: Argo, Chronicle, The Dark Knight Rises, The Kid With A Bike, Life of Pi, Magic Mike, Prometheus, Silver Linings Playbook...:)

"And so it is...Just like you said it would be...Life goes easy on me...Most of the time..."

My favorite Christmas movie: "Eyes Wide Shut" with "Less Than Zero" a close second...
My favorite 2012 holiday moment: It's Christmas Eve and me and Mark. Z. Danielewski are talking about how much we both love Michael Buble...
The fact that Zero Dark Thirty never acknowledges or implicates US policies that led to 9/11 is what makes the movie such a moral washout.

Using suspense techniques (including sounds of real people dying) to make your blood boil is one of the worst things about Zero Dark Thirty.
I saw "Zero Dark Thirty" a few weeks ago and I checked-out when I realized it was an extreme American revenge fantasy about US imperialism.
Juiced-up Gotta-Kill-Osama ads for Zero Dark Thirty (pulsing music, rapid-cutting) equals awful situation re-imagined as fascist movie art.

3 AM. I'm still on the couch. Depressed and completely sober and realizing that everyone needs to read "Play It As It Lays" by Joan Didion.
Joan Didion on Hemingway: "Very direct sentences, smooth rivers, clear water over granite, no sinkholes..."
The view from the couch... http://t.co/gdHsZtBh
Still on the couch, reading a Paris Review interview with Joan Didion on my iPad while a completely unfunny episode of SNL plays itself out.
Skipped a Christmas party, laid on the couch and watched a depressing documentary about The Central Park Jogger case. This is where I'm at.
Gay friend told me that my Suraj Sharma tweets were "amusing" but "totally inappropriate" and that they pretty much sum up where I am now...
A long phone call from worried gay friend concerned about my mental well-being. He advised: 1. Go back to your shrink. 2. Get off Twitter...
Friends are concerned: What's happening? Why are you hating everything? Why are you so angry? Why don't you just chill out? What's wrong?!?
Tried to show the 26-year-old Savages but was told angrily that Weeds was so much better. Had giant fight even though I hate both of them.
@EllenBarkin I have always loved Ellen Barkin since I first saw her in "Diner" (amazing) and I hope she understands where I'm coming from.
Yeah, I'm a sexist but like women. Yeah, I like dudes but hate the gay agenda. Yeah, I think people are awful. I'm a mess: like everyone...
Okay, it was fun twenty years ago: I can't sit through "Point Break" now. But, my God, Keanu was beautiful and Kathryn Bigelow knew it...
I hated "Avatar"...
The only time I felt a woman director deserved the Oscar was Sofia Coppola for Lost In Translation because it had a no bullshit female tone.
The best movie Kathryn Bigelow has made so far--and by a long shot--is the deliriously campy "Point Break" but I'm afraid to watch it again.
I still believe that if "The Hurt Locker" had been directed by a man it would not have won the Oscar for best director.
Barraged today by people who think I'm "sexist" and "toxic" for thinking the beautiful Kathryn Bigelow is overrated because she's a woman...
Concerned Empire woman offended by Bigelow tweet writes "I love you, babe. But stop tweeting wasted." When the hell else should I tweet?!?
Anyone Unfollowing me should have known better and never Followed me in the first place. Wise up: pussies and snowflakes. Get the F over it.
Why does it make me happy that @RezaFarahan is now following me?
Kathryn Bigelow: Strange Days, K-19 The Widowmaker, Blue Steel, The Hurt Locker. Are we talking about visionary filmmaking or just OK junk?
Kathryn Bigelow would be considered a mildly interesting filmmaker if she was a man but since she's a very hot woman she's really overrated.
"Zero Dark Thirty" might win critics awards but "Silver Linings Playbook" will win the Best Picture Oscar. This is how it always happens...
Have been accused by someone that my Twitter rant last night about the movie version of "Les Miserables" was possibly the gayest thing ever.

To all you Generation Wuss snowflakes out there: GROW SOME BALLS.
The world needs more gays who don't subscribe to The Gay Middlebrow and awarding KA-WEENS GLAAD awards and letting stereotypes win Emmys...
Oh yeah and I forgot: "Les Miserables" opens on Christmas Day and (spoiler alert!) just about everyone in it dies. Merry fucking Christmas.
The one actor surviving the incomprehensible mess "Les Miserables" is Eddie Redmayne, who should get an award for avoiding humiliation...
"come over at do bring coke now..." Christ, I should have tweeted that while sitting through Les Miserables. I might have liked it then.
Tom Hooper blows just about every song in "Les Miserables" including "On My Own" which I didn't think possible no matter who directed it...
The film version of "Les Miserables" is so bad that it made me rethink why I ever loved the stage version. 2 hours and 40 minutes of tacky.
Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed A Dream" in Les Miserables is shot in one close-up and is so overwrought the dummies in the audience applauded...
Just left DGA screening of Les Miserables. Did I hear applause at the end or am I just losing my mind? Borderline ineptitude. A disaster...
Lindsay Lohan is great in "The Canyons" but this was the second choice. Pay attention to Leslie COUTTERAND.... http://t.co/LQGL77IO
We were almost kicked out of an early critic's screening of The English Patient because we were giggling so much. New York 1996. Happiness.
Suraj Sharma and Dev Patel? Problems, guys?
Suraj Sharma gives an amazing and incredibly moving performance in "Life of Pi" and seriously needs to do some porn. Misspelling: my fault.
Yes. His name is Suraj Sharma. Apologies.
Life of Pi is the movie I've thought about the most in 2012. As a writer I can't reconcile with its disturbing reveal: illusion vs. reality?
FYI: There. Is. No. New. Novel. Being. Written. Except for maybe The James Deen Story and something called "Come Over At Do Bring Coke Now."
Based on the terrific source material "Killing Them Softly" doesn't work at all, but the actor Scoot McNairy is now officially on the radar.
"Killing Them Softly" starring Brad Pitt is one of only eight films in Cinemascore's history to receive an "F" grade but..."Troy" didn't?!?
"And what have you learned about me?" she asked. "That you can hurt me," he replied, very much in love.

Adapted Screenplay: race between Argo and Silver Linings Playbook. Quentin could win because he should've won the last time he was robbed...
The Academy hates The Dark Knight Rises because I sat in that theater that night and listened to the banter in the lobby afterwards.
The Academy is going to go for Silver Linings Playbook and not Lincoln.
Wally Pfister has a very good shot at best DP though the Academy hates The Dark Knight Rises and he's said a lot of shit about The Avengers.
There's not a chance in hell that Ang Lee will win best director. That will be a fight between Ben Affleck and David O. Russell. Haneke? No.
Patrick Bateman and I loved Les Miserables in 1987. I'm seeing the movie this week. Early word is, um, good. But it looks like a disaster...
Patrick Bateman and I loved Les Miserables. Seeing a screening of the movie Tuesday. Early word says it works. But It looks like a disaster.
My choices so far: Picture: "Silver Linings Playbook." Director: Ang Lee (the storm sequence alone). Actor &amp; Actress: Cooper and Lawrence.
If you haven't read the not very good book Ang Lee's "Life of Pi" is based on be prepared for the most shocking, upsetting reveal of 2012...
Ang Lee is the director of the year with his visionary Life of Pi, despite a tedious first act and the Evasion Versus Spirituality Thing...
Silver Linings Playbook in the wrong hands could've been a ludicrous mess but it was in the right hands and it's the best movie of 2012.
Lincoln: intelligent script, good acting from Sally Field and Lewis (who was "great" but zzzz) yet its lust for nobility just turned me off.
@ItsGrahamParker has written some of my favorite songs and recorded three of my favorite records. I love how Apatow used you in THIS IS 40.
If we're talking about sheer enjoyment then I would rather re-watch "Shahs of Sunset" again than have to sit through "Lincoln" twice.

THIS IS 40 contains a hilarious Arcade Fire joke, and Charlyne Yi has a freak-out that is one of the funniest things I've seen this year...
THIS IS 40 is the kind of movie I totally respond to: sprawling, messy, hilarious, transparent and stars Leslie Mann in a great performance.
Biggest movie lie of the year: "Lincoln" is a great movie. Biggest truth of the year: "Silver Linings Playbook" is...
The "reality" of "Life of Pi" makes "Funny Games" look like a Pixar movie.
The problem with "Life of Pi" is that it's a lie. It's about lying. And if the "real" movie played out it would be a Michael Haneke film...
Life of Pi: yes, I believe we are the tiger. But I identified more strongly with the zebra.
I skimmed the unreadable book but Ang Lee's miraculous film convinced me that "Life of Pi" is actually about how we try to process horror.
The "Life of Pi" reveal is either totally bogusly horrible and life-denining or spiritually and creatively the way we process things. Ideas?
Just something that I can't get out of my mind today: Dylan Klebold drove a BMW and went to his prom.

Oh yeah, and dudes get off on the 10 page threesome sex scene in Glamorama but I wonder how many of them are on the DL. Two guys. One girl?
If I had a dollar for every teenage girl who told me they masturbated to the sex scenes in "American Psycho" and "Glamorama" I'd retire...
A legless Cotillard! A totally naked Schoenaerts! Soundtrack: Springsteen and Katy Perry! Director of A Prophet! Rust and Bone still bores.

Aaron Taylor Johnson is my favorite British young actor right now. Period. Ben Whishaw a close second...
If you've never read a novel pick up "Anna Karenina" and you will have the most intensely jolting and cinematic experience ever. Great book.
Lincoln: The gassiest team of the year--Spielberg, Kushner, Day-Lewis, John Williams--all upended by Sally Field's greatness. This happened.
Best ass of 2012: "Cloud Atlas"..."Savages" and "Magic Mike" runner-ups...
Best score of 2012: "Cloud Atlas."
Lincoln has the A-team of the year and its agenda is so noble and undeniable that you feel trapped into agreeing with it and liking it. No.
DP Wally Pfister's darkly luminous compositions are the main reason why "The Dark Knight Rises" makes it one of the top movies of 2012...
2012 best so far: Argo, Chronicle, The Dark Knight Rises, The Kid With A Bike, Life of Pi, Magic Mike, Prometheus, Silver Linings Playbook.
I'm happily surprised that people who don't usually read novels picked up Paul Murray's "Skippy Dies" and loved it. Thanks for the tweets...
After the first tedious 30 minutes are done with and that amazingly staged storm begins: does Ang Lee become the greatest filmmaker of 2012?
There hasn't been a more annoying or wildly misguided movie from 2012 than the Joe Wright/Tom Stoppard "adaptation" of Anna Karenina. Awful.

The trailer for my favorite movie about writers. Reprise by Joachim Trier, director of Oslo, August 31st. http://t.co/M8AYt7YI via @youtube
Earlier today I watched the great Norwegian director Joachim Trier's "Oslo, August 31st": a totally haunting movie about addiction and loss.
If you get jacked-up over something as charmingly innocuous as "Liz &amp; Dick" then there is a bigger problem at large than the movie itself...
I've taken Lindsay to task before: the fun I'm having watching "Liz &amp; Dick" has nothing to do with the fact that she's in "The Canyons"...
All I keep thinking: "Liz &amp; Dick" is just chintzy fun and I'd rather sit through it twice than endure something like "The Sessions" again.
I'm thoroughly enjoying and consistently amused by Liz &amp; Dick. The haters went overboard on this one.

Silver Linings Playbook's rom-com conventionality could have been a problem but the cast and David O. Russell's craziness makes it soar.
Someone just tweeted that "Imperial Bedrooms" is the "laziest book you've ever written." They're kind of right. It was all about the pain...
Silver Linings Playbook: 2012's best movie. Judging from what's lurking in the distance, nothing else is going to replace it so: see it now.
One of the biggest shocks in my life was when a friend sincerely asked: "Wait a minute. You attached FEELINGS to sex? What are you? Crazy?"

Quick interesting take by Michael Wood on P.T. Anderson's "The Master" in The London Review of Books. Volume 34, Number 19. 11 October 2012.
Holy Motors didn't fully work for me. I loved some of it but was bored and I wished that Leos Carax had given Kylie Minogue a better song...
Don't trust me on movies since "Silver Linings Playbook" and "Magic Mike" are my two favorite films of 2012. Trust yourselves and just go...
On a scale of 1-10 working with Lindsay Lohan on "The Canyons" I'd say given the amazing performance she gives, well, a possible 9 maybe 10.
If you're really bored this weekend and want to read a fantastic novel pick up Skippy Dies by Paul Murray. I laughed and wept this morning.
I kept thinking if only David O. Russell had directed "The Descendants" then it would have a shot at being good but probably not. Onward...
"Lincoln" is obligation. It's sitting in history class again. "Silver Linings Playbook" is the best movie of the year. See it this weekend.

There's no such thing as "inappropriate" AIDS comments, rape comments, pedophile comments. That world is over now. It doesn't exist anymore.
The only time I held back a tweet because I admired the talent involved was about how much I really disliked the musical The Book of Mormon.

He always believed in explanations: the universe as a series of questions posed to its inhabitants with the answers waiting like prizes...
I'll be (for some unfortunately) tweeting about "Silver Linings Playbook" and why it's my favorite movie of 2012 despite its flaws and shit.
Lost over 100 followers for constantly mentioning Bradley Cooper's great performance in Silver Linings Playbook. Or maybe I'm just a jerk...
Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence give the two best leading performances of 2012 in "Silver Linings Playbook" despite the sitcomy set-up.
I care more about Bradley Cooper's jazzy, crazy, messy Pat in Silver Linings Playbook than I do Daniel Day Lewis's noble Lincoln perfection.
After midnight I get bored...
Magic Mike is not about male strippers but about the economy. People who don't realize this probably argue that Cabaret is just a musical...
I don't care how great Daniel Day Lewis is in Lincoln. I get it but I just don't care. It doesn't change anything. He's great but whatever.
The best two movies of 2012 that reflected where we are now: Silver Linings Playbook (light) and Magic Mike (dark). Which one wins awards?
And I wouldn't be surprised if Silver Linings Playbook's Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro all win an Oscar next year...
Maybe I'm overpraising Silver Linings Playbook with its sitcom premise but I think David O Russell's craziness lifts it to the best of 2012.
You're an evil person. You're a person who pretends to love people so you can control them. But you don't care about anyone except yourself.
"Magic Mike" is the best American movie so far of 2012. Period. If you don't understand this you don't understand movies...
Unfollow. Unfollow. Unfollow. Please God Unfollow....
It took me 48 years to finally understand women. I do now. It's horrifying.
Namaah@The_HappyNoodle tweets: I miss when you were the genius who wrote Less Than Zero and Lunar Park. My reply: "So do I babe, so do I..."
The transparency issue between men and women is based on that a woman's allure is  about her illusion while men know their own allure isn't.
The woman the three men had dinner with tonight admitted that yes: women do not have the transparency that men have because "we care more."
Men are liars but in a fairly boring and predictable way. Women, on the other hand, have strange complicated ways of lying that trump men.
I think it's just that women's natural inclination leans towards secrecy, mysteriousness, an otherness lodged in their DNA. It's not a slam.
I've met many men who are transparent but I've probably never known a woman who is totally transparent. Not good or bad. It is what it is...
Tonight. Dinner. Three men. One woman. A conversation about transparency. The conclusion being that women are incapable of transparency...
It was also the music of course but wasn't it really the remoteness of The Rolling Stones that made them so powerful and popular?
In the original cut of The Informers Brad Renfro begs for his life before Mickey Rourke shoots him in the desert. CUT from the film. A loss.
Paul Schrader wrote the original screenplay for "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
Wye Oak is the only band that calms me now...

The funniest AIDS jokes I've heard are from HIV-positive gay men. Straight David Foster Wallace calling AIDS a "blessing" is truly awful...
Why don't well-meaning gay (and straight) people understand that gay people find it funny to deconstruct gay stereotypes and have a laugh?
The Gay Fascist Middlebrow that got angry over the Glee tweet is the problem with the politically correct gay agenda. We are all different.
When I tweeted "watching Glee is like stepping into a puddle of HIV" I stole it from my HIV-positive friends. Gay Fascist Middlebrow=EVIL...
The source of Saint David Foster Wallace's "AIDS is a blessing" quote is from his new collection of posthumous essays. Total fraud and jerk.
David Foster Wallace writes "AIDS is a blessing, a gift perhaps bestowed by nature to restore some critical balance." This is the problem...
Supposedly Mandy Patinkin thinks that Homeland is too important and serious a show to make fun of. This is Empire earnestness at its worst.
I heard that Mandy Patinkin was somehow "offended" by SNL's meh parody of "Homeland" last Saturday. This is so Empire I can't believe it...
Patrick Bateman is a Libra.
Michiko Kakutani glowingly reviews David Foster Wallace's collection today. She used to shit all over his books. But he's dead now. Gross.
The last 24-hours someone said "I hate how stridently opinionated you are" while someone else said "I totally love how opinionated you are."
When GENERATION WUSS starts complaining that I "used to write important books" I concur, then silently weep while listening to Rihanna...
Patrick Bateman is 18, a claw-hammer, a hatchet, various syringes, a 14 year-old girl, a bathtub, muffled screams, Sean crying next door...
Someone just asked me if it bothers me that my work is disparaged as sexist among critics. It doesn't. Because all the guys are assholes...
Probably the most moving and enthusiastic crowd I've ever encountered as an author was Galway in 2010 during the "Imperial Bedrooms" tour...
Most disturbing thing I've read in a long time is Michael Jackson's autopsy report in Vanity Fair. He had "no nose." Yes, I knew this but...
Up way too late reading Paul Murray's extraordinary Skippy Dies. 660 pages about a boys prep school in Dublin and every page is pure magic.

Split Enz "I Hope I Never" played over a scene of dismembering a teenage girl is probably not where I'm at. As much as I like the idea...
Patrick playing Altered Images singing "Don't Talk To Me About Love" while slamming an ax into the crotch of a 15 year-old girl upsets me...
Patrick Bateman as a teenager in the early 80's and the horrible things he does with teenage girls. So grotesque that I don't think I can...
The more Patrick Bateman is haunting me the more I want to write a sequel. But it's so gory and awful I don't want to put myself through it.
Patrick Bateman is now listening to the last Wilco record.
Patrick Bateman is everywhere. He came up to me at Musso and Frank tonight and asked if I wanted a cucumber slice in that Hendricks Martini.
Was Taylor Kitsch the sexiest guy on Friday Night Lights or was it really Zach Gilford? Jeez, I'm losing followers with every tweet tonight.
Twitter follower made the excellent choice that Sexiest Man Alive should've been Taylor Kitsch. Yes. Unfortunately three bombs rule him out.
Future Sexiest Man Alive: Rob Marciano? Ben Whishaw? Alex Pettyfer? Richard Engel? Adam Driver? Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Aaron Taylor Johnson?
I can go with Channing Tatum as the "Sexiest Man Alive" but...who is the "Unsexiest Man Alive"? Yes, I'm using a hashtag. #UnsexiestManAlive
I can't reiterate this enough but the novel "Skippy Dies" by Paul Murray is fantastic. I'm reading it slowly because I don't want it to end.
"Shining Light" by Ash is my favorite song.
I know this might sound absolutely crazy but Sally Field is amazing as Mary Todd Lincoln. Tony Kushner wrote the part and it's awesome...
The best movie Spielberg made in the last decade is "Munich" marred by the I-can't-have-sex-because-I'm-so-guilt-ridden" scene at the end...
"Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom" might be one of the best action movies ever made.
I love Spielberg but give me the kinetic masterpiece that is "Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom" any day over the solemnity of "Lincoln."
For "Girls" fans Adam Driver (crush) has a small unflattering cameo in "Lincoln" where he just stares uncomprehendingly at Daniel Day Lewis.
Hollywood liberalism is at its best and worst in "Lincoln" because it's an obvious movie made by proud people who want to be congratulated.
The tiresomely noble "Lincoln" is superbly written and acted but why did I feel like I was back in 11th grade watching The History Channel?
I love the fact that Ellen Barkin made a "super-subtle joke" about me on "The New Normal" tonight and has also blocked me on Twitter. Cool.
I heard there was a joke about me on "The New Normal" tonight. Missed it because I was asleep at "Lincoln" but I hope Nene Leakes made it...
"Magic Mike" is the best American movie of 2012. Seeing "Lincoln" tomorrow. I have never snickered or rolled eyes more during a trailer...
A reason why I like the endings of 1970's movies but, whatever: God bless America. Electra glide in blue.: http://t.co/zlBrNaOX via @youtube

Skyfall starts well but despite Ben Whishaw and Judi Dench it ends up with the lamest climax of any Bond movie since Diamonds Are Forever...
What happened to SAM RILEY? After "Control" I thought he would be a huge star. Forget the Burberry ads but that performance was phenomenal.
"Ray" might be the worst music bio-pic ever...
"Control" is the best rock bio-pic ever made.
Of all the versions of Lou Reed's "Perfect Day" Susan Boyle's is the eeriest and ultimately most devastating. The best new Christmas song...
The greatest and most sentimental song of my generation. It simply beats out everything so deal with it: http://t.co/7qdA2apN via @youtube
"I just can't follow Bret Easton Ellis anymore. He's so pretentious that I hate myself for following him." Hey GENERATION WUSS: Grow a dick.
There really hasn't been a good Bond film since "The Spy Who Loved Me" and I actually think "Quantum of Solace" was better than "Skyfall"...
"Skyfall" is so Empire: the villain is gayish, foreign and pro-transparency which is why 80% of its U.S. audience is white and over forty...
"You're concerned about the Ayatollah?" asks Alan Arkin in Argo. "Try the WGA." Maybe the best line of 2012 that no one outside of L.A. got.

Sean Bateman is alive and happily closeted in West Hollywood, hooking-up with Taylor Lautner whom he affectionately refers to as "bat face".
In the cold LA night Bateman keeps whispering: "You thought you got rid of me, Bret?...But you didn't...I'm still here, you little bitch..."
I've just added the "Skyfall" ringtone to my iPhone. "This is the end...hold your breath and count to ten..."
"OH STOP IT! You made money off your break-ups," the 26 year-old scolded me. "But I didn't make ADELE-money!" I shouted back, then sobbed...
After getting too many recommendations to ignore I'm now on page 258 of "Skippy Dies" by Paul Murray and loving it. Total sheer enjoyment...
2012's most provocative line: "How do you know this is my first time?" Daniel Craig's Bond asks Javier Bardem's Silva after the fondling...

This week I kept thinking that Rebel Wilson should have played the Denzel Washington role in Flight and the Helen Hunt role in The Sessions.
Why hasn't anyone warned me that "Flight" was a two-and-a-half hour PSA for Alcoholics Anonymous and NOT the action movie being advertised?
I wish the best for Lindsay.

Someone asked me if I watched "non-English spoken movies" and my only answer is yes, I watched "Bachelorette"...
Worst movies this fall: The Paperboy (though I love Zac Efron); Trouble With the Curve; Seven Psychopaths (ditto Martin McDonagh but meh)...
The best movies this fall: "Pitch Perfect" and "The Perks of Being A Wallflower" and, um, "Amour" and "Argo" (but with many reservations)...
I have to admit that I liked "Moonrise Kingdom" a lot more on the second viewing even though there is a distracting whimsy factor that bugs.
But then the movie I liked the most this fall was "Pitch Perfect" so, um, kill me...while you're singing "Just The Way You Are" a cappella.
But I was always a fan of the much-underrated "Speed Racer" and its amazing visual design which compensated for the silliness of its story.
Despite reservations and endless complaints, I overall liked the movie version of "Cloud Atlas" regardless of its earnest embarrassments...
Yet another reason not to live in New York.

The "lawn mower" sequence in "Sinister" is 2012's biggest shock at the movies...
Neither Bob Clark's "Black Christmas" OR Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" are available on iTunes or Netflix? What the fuck!?!
I'm so bored working on a script that I've resorted to watching Season 3 of The Real L Word. "When artificial insemination failed to--" OFF.
"Argo" is really good until the last ten self-congratulatory minutes which go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...
And yeah, "Argo" was pretty good too.

"Sinister" has the best opening shot of any movie from 2012.
For about two-thirds of its running time "Sinister" is by far the scariest horror movie of the year. And then suddenly: it isn't.

Lusting for a respectful greatness: Paul Thomas Anderson did himself in after Boogie Nights and Magnolia. This happens all the time. Vodka.
Magnolia and Boogie Nights are movies that had contempt for respect but There Will Be Blood and The Master and Punch Drunk Love: the abyss.
Just watched Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece "Boogie Nights" (his best movie by far) and wondered what James Deen thinks about it. James?

Michael Haneke's "Amour" is what "On Golden Pond" would have been if it was directed by Hitler.
Michael Haneke is basically a strict and austere academic. "The White Ribbon" is great filmmaking with a kind of dumb thesis at its core.
Michael Haneke's chilling formal "mastery" is always impressive yet always leaves me exhausted. "Amour" is undeniable but also a big trick.
Michael Haneke is that weird rarity: one of the world's greatest filmmakers who has never made a great film.
The screening of Michael Haneke's riveting "Amour" left me in a foul mood. It contains the most symbolic pigeon I've ever seen in a movie...

Taylor Swift gets it more than Fiona Apple. If you don't understand what that means then you're lost in the Empire. Sorry: Generation Wuss.
"Why don't you have anything positive to say?" whines a member of Generation Wuss while petting her cat and listening to Fiona Apple.
During "Looper" I was mildly distracted that Joseph Gordon-Levitt resembled porn-star James Deen more than he did a young Bruce Willis...
I gave "Looper" 100 minutes. Finding out it beat B.O. records in China makes me feel vaguely vindicated and less confused by my response...
Am I completely in the minority having just walked out of Rian Johnson's "Looper" or did people actually like this movie?
I should probably know better because it's against everything I like but I still think Woody Allen's "Interiors" is a 1970's masterpiece...

"Ravedeath 1972" by Tim Hecker was the soundtrack playing while I desperately drove through the canyons to the studios in L.A. today. Scary.
Ellen Barkin's role in The New Normal is really well-written and genuinely rude. She is the reason to watch the show and will win an Emmy...
Andrew Rannells in "The New Normal" makes Sean Hayes in "Will &amp; Grace" seem like Jason Statham in just about anything.
The writing on "The New Normal" is fairly funny for a sitcom despite the fact that it's a gay minstrel show. I wanted to trash it but can't.
2001: A Space Odyssey has the most intense gay love triangle of any American film. HAL kills hot Gary Lockwood to be with hot Keir Dullea...
2001: A Space Odyssey: the scene where Gary Lockwood in tight-whities listens to his parents birthday video is shot like late-60's gay porn.
Was re-watching 2001: A Space Odyssey which might be the best-directed movie ever and wondering why Kubrick cast the two hottest astronauts.
A straight man bitched to me after I described what GayFace is that he now sees it everywhere. I said: That's because you were at The Emmys.

"Each time I have tried to communicate with someone, love has disappeared..." Antonioni, La Notte (1961).
Watching "The Perks of Being A Wallflower" I was reminded that playing Bowie's "Heroes" over any scene or montage automatically improves it.
In "The Perks of Being A Wallflower" Ezra Miller takes the cliche-gay-role and rethinks  the cliche-gay-role in a completely modern way.
"The Perks of Being A Wallflower" is a very moist movie about the ominous beginnings of Generation Wuss but I really liked it a lot.
A mystery doesn't need to be solved.
Ira Sach's "Keep The Lights On" doesn't fully work but it's the best movie about two gay men since Andrew Haigh's "Weekend." A new outlook.
As someone who has used Grindr? Paris Hilton isn't that far off.
I kind of agree with Paris Hilton.
Ezra Miller is the future.

I'm about to watch a movie with The 26-year-old. The choices have boiled down to three weird, random choices: Sleeper, Vertigo or Cruising.
"Envy is the central fact of American life..." Gore Vidal.
Whenever I watch "Californication" I am always horrified that "I" am somewhat responsible for Hank Moody's career...
I just purchased Chris Ware's "Building Stories" because of a recommendation from J.J. Abrams.
P J Harvey's "Let England Shake" is the best record of her career by a fucking landslide. It's terrifying and awesome. I'm late to the game.
I Heart Huckabees: I don't think there's a more telling or more powerful scene from that decade when Jude Law vomits in the conference room.
Not a popular opinion but David O. Russell's I Heart Huckabees is one of the great unappreciated and misunderstood movies of the Aughties.
David O.Russell's Silver Linings Playbook: it's only mid-September but this is now the front-runner for the best picture Oscar next year...
The Master: Yeah, whatever: I haven't made the great movies P.T. Anderson has, but you don't need to be a chef to know if a meal tastes bad.
P.T. Anderson's "The Master" is the kind of movie that Paul Kinsey or Ken Cosgrove from "Mad Men" would have made if given the chance...
The P.T. Anderson who made Boogie Nights and Magnolia "matured" a long time ago, which is fine, but not when you end up with The Master...
God, I wish P.T. Anderson would spend his huge talent on something trashy and sexy and fun. The current movie suggests an ominous dead-end.
I can't help it: "David Comes to Life" by Fucked Up is one of my favorite records of the last couple of years. Fantastic L.A. driving music.

David Foster Wallace: "I feel like I have learned so much about what good writing ought to be." The new earnest irony-free fascism begins...
One of the many bad David Foster Wallace ideas/daydreams: reassuring sincerity and a return to earnestness was a virtue for a prose writer.
The worst idea that David Foster Wallace put into play: irony was defeatist. Added plus: Burger King commercials really, really upset him...
What gay Hollywood was dreaming about itself in 1978: Jane Wagner's "Moment by Moment" with "lovers" Lily Tomlin and John Travolta. Crazy.
Reading: "Ten Thousand Saints" by Eleanor Henderson, which is one of the best first novels I've read in a long time.
I forgot how much I liked Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Dreamers" (2003) and that Louis Garrel has one of the greatest faces in modern movies.
"Time to go to bed," says The 26-Year-Old as I'm pulled out of my office...
My favorite lyric that I always laugh happily at: "Would she go down on you in a theater?"
"Smell that, Core?" David Foster Wallace asks a friend at Amherst. "It's springtime. The smell of cunt in the air." From the D.T. Max bio...
David Foster Wallace: "shallow and tricky, philosophy with zingers, a clever thought with three wise-ass sentences around it..." Sums it up.
David Foster Wallace: when I say "better" writer I don't know what the fuck that means except he knew big words, syntax, grammar. Big deal.
No problem that David Foster Wallace was smarter than me and a better writer but he was so much colder than I ever was. He faked it. Almost.
I have to admit that as much as I dislike David Foster Wallace as a literary persona D.T. Max's compassionate bio is really well-written...
The fake-earnest Midwestern "sincerity" of David Foster Wallace that a generation of babies relates to is the thing I hate most as a writer.
"There is no truth. There is only perception..." Gustave Flaubert.
"Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know..." Ernest Hemingway.
This has got to be one of the most solemnly humorless things I've ever read: Why We're Unfollowing Bret Easton Ellis http://t.co/yCFGCEi0
Whether he's playing tennis with Jay McInerney, beating up Mary Karr or pissing all over Philip Roth: David Foster Wallace is insufferable.
DFW is the best example of a contemporary male writer lusting for a kind of awful greatness that he simply wasn't able to achieve. A fraud.
David Foster Wallace was so needy, so conservative, so in need of fans--that I find the halo of sentimentality surrounding him embarrassing.
Reading D.T. Max's bio I continue to find David Foster Wallace the most tedious, overrated, tortured, pretentious writer of my generation...
Saint David Foster Wallace: a generation trying to read him feels smart about themselves which is part of the whole bullshit package. Fools.
David Foster Wallace carried around a literary pretentiousness that made me embarrassed to have any kind of ties to the publishing scene...
Anyone who finds David Foster Wallace a literary genius has got to be included in the Literary Doucebag-Fools Pantheon...
Reading D.T. Max's bio of DFW and OMG is the solemnity of the David Foster Wallace myth on a purely literary level borderline sickening...
Watching Don't Look Now reminds me of working with Nic Roeg on a Catherine The Great movie for Bob Guccione. Never happened but it was fun.
Writing horror script dealing with premonition and water I decided to re-watch the great, hugely scary Don't Look Now (1973). Masterpiece.
The rejection of middlebrow sentimentality is the most furiously important thing an artist can achieve right now in this historical moment.

Ending the summer of 2012 by watching one of my all-time favorite movies: DePalma's "Phantom of the Paradise" (1974). RIP: William Finley...
Beasts of the Southern Wild: probably the most overrated 2012 movie. The earnest good-intentions killed the legitimate moviemaking fever...
The best American movie so far this year is "Magic Mike" and if you're thinking it's "Moonrise Kingdom" then you are a hipster douchebag...
Don Draper's unofficial theme "You Only Live Twice" plays over a black empty studio and into a bar where a girl asks him "Are you alone?"...
If the haunting, thrilling final minutes of Mad Men: Season Five are any indication then The Wire might not end up being TV's greatest show.
And then there's the whole Drake thing ("I LOVE DRIZZLY!! LEAVE ME ALONE!") and, of course, this... http://t.co/I2b557ru
1970s American movie night with The 25 year-old: Manhattan and Jaws. Argument that ensued suggests I'm both Isaac Davis and Bruce the shark.
Why do I find Mad Men so completely mesmerizing and Breaking Bad so impossibly contrived? And please don't tell me it's because I'm a fag...
Marathon viewing of Mad Men: Season 5 is distracting because Elisabeth Moss's Peggy Olson looks so much like a young Ayn Rand. A new biopic?
I am spellbound by marathon viewing of Mad Men: Season 5. The opening episode  was--sigh--better than any movie I've seen so far this year.
For some reason the TV character I want to see a lot more of is Kenneth Cosgrove.
Fifty Shades of Grey movie will DEFINITELY be written by a woman and the budget will be below 15 million. Ana will be played by an unknown.
"Fifty Shades of Grey" will be budgeted at 12-15 million and James Deen is on the list of actors to play Christian Grey according to source.
Just got inside information that James Deen is actually in the running to play Christian in "Fifty Shades of Grey" with E.L. James support.
Distressed: a producer last night was pushing me to write a script for Aaron Johnson and then admitted Aaron Johnson has no idea who I am...
Thinking of writing a Notes On piece about Middlebrow Gay's love of narcissistic victimization vs. the cool gays who just don't give a shit.
Shia LaBeouf disses Spielberg, defends Malick, naked in Sigur Ros video, will fuck for new Von Trier movie, survives meh Lawless=I love him.
Conversation with Michelle Williams over dinner yet failed to admit that her performance in Take This Waltz is the best I've seen this year.
Read a post today by a young gay guy who was a fan but is now "disillusioned" by my "lame" Tweeter feed. Another victim of Generation Wuss.
Watching The Expendables 2 today I not only loved all of the plastic surgery but also how Jean-Claude Van Damme purrs "I like a shall-ange."
Weekend movies: I liked Premium Rush so much more than the earnest serious puling of Red Hook Summer and Compliance that it was a reminder.
As a fan of Don DeLillo and David Cronenberg I think that Cosmopolis works even though the Academy screening last night suggested otherwise.
Robert Pattinson is very good in Cosmopolis: the prostate exam, the fake orgasms, the Patrick Bateman via Christopher Walken impersonation.
Insomnia: Paul Schrader tells me that Gay Middlebrow sounds like a character out of Trollope...
Insomnia: 2 in the morning and I'm watching YouTube videos on Gore Vidal and Joan Didion and I always knew it would be like this. Ambien...
Is the Gay Middlebrow dictating how other gays should express themselves or are they only comfortable with the cheap, sentimental narrative?
The Bends by Radiohead may be the greatest rock record of the 90s but OK Computer will be looked at as the decade's most overrated record...
Maybe one of the most important cultural   questions of my generation: What in the fuck happened to Radiohead?

JAMES DEEN as Christian in THE CANYONS, written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader. What happens next? http://t.co/4KjujyeM
The desert: a dozen manuscripts and still the best thing I've read is Lena Dunham's "First Love" in the August 13/20 2012 of The New Yorker.
In the desert: Is it just me or has 2012 felt like the summer of death?
"What is greatness? It is the capacity to live by three fundamental values: reason, purpose, self-esteem." Ayn Rand.
"In principle, I believe that taxation should be voluntary. Like everything else..." Ayn Rand.
"A rational man will never be guided by desires or whims, only by values based on his rational judgment..." Ayn Rand.
"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I respect..." Ayn Rand, Anthem.
"Faith, as such, is extremely detrimental to human life. Faith is the negation of reason..." Ayn Rand.
"There are two sides to every issue. One side is right and the other is wrong, but the middle is always evil." Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged.
"I consider promiscuity immoral not because sex is evil but because sex is too good and too important..." Ayn Rand.
To say 'I love you' one must know first how to say the 'I'...Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead.
"Friendship, family life, human relationships are not primary in a man's life. A man who places others first is an emotional parasite." Ayn.
Ayn Rand: "In any historical period where men were free, it has always been the most rational philosophy that won."
I have not taken Ayn Rand seriously since college but now in the desert looking at pics of Paul Ryan in a bathing suit I've changed my mind.
Desert reading: I shouldn't like Amy Sohn but she keeps transcending a genre and I love her latest novel "Motherland" which is her best yet.
In the desert: it was sometime around midnight when the edibles kicked in...
In the desert: okay, we just found Danny on Grindr.
In the desert: staying somewhere that resembles The Overlook from The Shining: but 93 degrees at night yet I still feel like Jack Torrance.
In the desert: another fight with the 25 year-old, screaming "WILL YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU LOVE DRAKE?!? It's driving me crazy!"
Finding out who Brent Ellis is the 25 year-old gets on Grindr: discovers 16 guys who are 0-10 feet away. No, we're not staying at The Ace.
I honestly thought that when I first watched it that The Big Bang Theory was about four gay dudes who work at Caltech and a butch waitress.
In the desert: Alex Pettyfer got back to me and said he would've loved to be in the Christina Aguilera video but is shooting a movie. Lying?
In the desert: I'm beginning to feel terrible about what I said about Matt Bomer and gayness. I think I'm right but I still feel terrible...
In the desert: just e-mailed Alex Pettyfer to see if he wanted to star in the new Christina Aguilera video because someone asked me to...
In the desert: found out that there's an online petition to remove me from Twitter. Also found out that The 25 Year-Old signed it...
In the desert: found out that where I'm staying is someone named Brent Ellis and that's why the reservations were somehow screwed-up...
I'm so in love with Drake right now I don't know what to do...The Desert will answer this problem...
"Desert Tweets" this year will involve Drake, The Shining, James Deen, You Never Give Me Your Money, and a famous American woman novelist...
Will be starting this years "Desert Tweets" tomorrow. Last year it was: Angry Birds, Ocho tequila, You Never Give Me Your Money, Lady GaGa.
Love the idea that Paul Ryan could be Christian Grey despite (or because of) the Ayn Rand obsession. It works for both "characters" Cool...
I like Matt Bomer. But the only thing I remember about him from "Magic Mike" is his stoned character letting his woman fuck Alex Pettyfer...
The complicated problem with Matt Bomer has to do with male attractiveness in our society and how we embrace/denounce it. Paul Ryan anyone?
The Bourne Legacy's centerpiece: a masterfully done Tony Gilroy specialty: corporate murderers calming down and trying to kill Rachel Weisz.
The Bourne Legacy. Thoughts: why does Edward Norton hate me? And does anyone else think that Jeremy Renner comes off as a little, um...gay?
THE CANYONS: another victim in the unravelling of madness written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader... http://t.co/eH7hcMba
The LGBT community really supports Ryan Murphy's series The New Normal? Is this how they want to be portrayed? Dignity? Ugh. Premiere? 9/11.
Paul Schrader just corrected me: Tuesday the 14th is the wrap date on THE CANYONS. Here's Paul with James and Defazio. http://t.co/ACkXTqmX
THE CANYONS: It's a wrap. James Deen changes pants before getting into his car after finishing his role as Christian. http://t.co/JnMGgGVp
And damn, Harry is so hot...
I don't believe in guilty pleasures but I love the closing ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics. I love the Brits. I can't help it.
Okay, I can't help it: I'm old enough to be moved by the joyous tackiness of the closing ceremonies at the London Olympics 2012.
I loved Ian Somerhalder's performance in The Rules of Attraction. It was funny, wry, brave, and he got to make out with James Van Der Beek.
I'd love to see Sarah Silverman as Ana Steele taking down solemn CG in 50 Shades of Grey. She's hot as hell and funny in Take This Waltz...
@iansomerhalder I'm not a part of Fifty Shades of Grey but I really wish the best for you. And I hope you get the part of Christian. Sexy.
But I still don't think Matt Bomer should play the role.
Let's destroy the bullshit stereotypes of Hollywood studio moviemaking and cast a gay actor as Christian Grey in "50 Shades of Grey." A win.
You know what? I changed my mind: I now think a gay actor HAS GOT to play Christian Grey. It's IMPERATIVE that someone gay plays him...
If you think Modern Family has a progressive attitude about gayness then you're a retrograde tool. The fact that it's being lauded: a joke.
You're missing the point. I'm not a homophobe. I'm a misanthrope. I hate the way homosexuality is presented in our entertainment culture.
And please don't get me started on the gay The Big Bang Theory. I'm too tired to go there. Gayness personified. Another terrible CBS sitcom.
You don't think the makers of How I Met Your Mother didn't KNOW that Neil Patrick Harris was gay and that would be part of the joke? Really?
Look, I like Neil Patrick Harris especially when he's hosting The Tonys but "How I Met Your Mother" is like all CBS sitcoms a piece of crap.
Then why not cast Jason Segal in the Neil Patrick Harris role in How I Met Your Mother? The meta-joke is that Harris is openly gay. Lame...
Feel complicated about Neil Patrick Harris on How I Met Your Mother: central joke being that he's a gay actor playing a het womanizer. Um...
After Anastasia asks the gay question Matt Bomer as Christian "raises his eyebrows, a cool gleam in his eyes. He does not look pleased."
Scene in Fifty Shades of Grey I'm most looking forward to: Matt Bomer as CG: "Are you gay, Mr. Grey?" Matt sighs: "No, Anastasia, I'm not."
To reiterate I NEVER said gay actors can't play straight roles. If that were true my entire generation of male movie stars would be jobless.
However: in the VERY specific case of trophy-husband Matt Bomer playing Christian Grey then it makes things problematic. That's the truth...
Reading all of these articles about Matt Bomer: I NEVER said gay actors can't play straight roles, or straight actors can't play gay roles.

Watching one of the 5 greatest films ever made: Godard's "Contempt" "Contempt" "Contempt" "Contempt" "Contempt"--screenwriters beware.
What's worse? My ugly mug next to Matt Bomers in 300 articles or that the dude who wrote Cars 2 is on the Fifty Shades of Grey writing list?
I've never been called "self-loathing" more times than today. I think a little self-loathing is an underrated quality. More people need it.
I was just spit on at the West Hollywood Pavillions supermarket while passing the Free HIV-testing van in the parking lot.
Well, there goes my GLAAD Humanitarian award.
My ideal Christian Grey is James Deen.
Regarding Matt Bomer as Christian Grey: there's the small problem that he will be 36 when the movie starts shooting. A gorgeous 36...but 36.
I like Matt Bomer. I think Matt Bomer is sexy and a good actor. Do I think he'll be discriminated against regarding 50 Shades of Grey? Yes.
If you think Universal is going to hire an openly gay actor to star in the adaptation of the biggest novel of all time: YOU are ignorant...
Andrew Haigh's "Weekend" from 2011 is probably the best--and least condescending--movie about gay men ever made. Check it out.
Final word: there is no way in hell that the makers of "Fifty Shades of Grey" will hire an openly gay actor to play Christian Grey. Period.
Why Brokeback Mountain was a hit was because it starred two beautiful actors instead of two real ugly characters from the story. Producers.
Hollywood is the most homophobic place in the entire world.
Would anyone watch Brokeback Mountain if it stayed true to the original story where both characters are hideously ugly? No. Homo beauty WIN?
Look, all actors are GAY: they put on make up and pretend to be someone else. That's just a fact. Rock and roll. Deal with it. Scientology?
I think Matt Bomer is incredibly handsome and a good actor but I think he comes off totally gay in White Collar. And that is why no to CG...
I actually think it's cool that women want Matt Bomer as Christian Grey. It means that we've moved beyond stereotypes and that gay is hot...
I am NOT discriminating Matt Bomer because of his sexuality. Fifty Shades of Grey demands an actor that is genuinely into women. Get it?!?
And I think if Matt Bomer wants the role which I doubt the international press tour will be an embarrassing fiasco. He's not CG. Never...
Okay I'll say it. Matt Bomer isn't right for Christian Grey because he is openly gay. He's great for other roles but this is too big a game.
Jesus, the homophobia over Matt Bomer not being Christian Grey is so unsettling and aesthetically retarded. He's NOT right for Christian G.
Fifty Shades of Grey: the most popular book on the planet having Matt Bomer--a gay actor--play Christian Grey is absolutely ludicrous. Why?
Fifty Shades of Grey: Matt Bomer is NOT about discrimination. It's about an intensely straight actor wanting absolutely to screw Ana Steele.
Fifty Shades of Grey: Matt Bomer: I don't care how good an actor you are but being married to another man complicates things for playing CG.
Okay. Let's finalize this. Matt Bomer is totally hot and a very good actor. He is NOT right for Christian Grey and it complicates the role.
Slow day: drove around to The Decemberists The King Is Dead, watched Annie Hall, texted James Deen, grateful for Fifty Shades of Grey fans.
Fifty Shades of Grey: The 25-year-old asks "Why are you so bummed? You dodged a fucking bullet." My response: "I'm tired. I'm going to bed."
@E_L_James I hope you find someone as passionate as I was about "Fifty Shades of Grey." I will miss it. Moving on. Laters, baby...
Thanks to the fans for the months of intense support. Your awesome enthusiasm and great suggestions were instructive and meaningful to me...
It's a very major disappointment to announce that I've somehow been taken off the list of possible screenwriters for Fifty Shades of Grey...
The only time I came in contact with Robert Hughes was in 1991 when he threatened to leave Random House if they published "American Psycho."
The #1 movie that ruined American movies: "Easy Rider"...
1975: the ultimate year when auteur filmmaking and the studio system matched-up resulting in the greatest period of modern movies ever made.
Fifty Shades of Grey/AP: if you don't get that Jean is Ana and Patrick is Christian then you don't get that Bateman is a helpless romantic.
Fifty Shades of Grey: Yes, fans, I get it. If Patrick Bateman had been challenged by Anastasia Steele he might have become Christian Grey.
Getting 1975 nostalgic: just watched Dog Day Afternoon with the 25-year-old who asked, stunned: "Wait. They used to make movies like THAT?"
Oscar Nominee's for Best Picture 1975: Barry Lyndon, Dog Day Afternoon, Jaws, Nashville, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Enough said. Sigh.
Fifty Shades of Grey: I've nothing at all against Matt Bomer. I've just realized that I'm gradually shifting over to Ian Somerhalder for CG.
If Jesse Tyler is smart enough to get the Matt Bomer quip then all you sensitive snowflakes out there should man-up and eat a Chick-fil-A...
Reading: the very funny Everybody's Right, an Italian novel by Paolo Sorrentino, the filmmaker of Il Divo, and translated by Howard Curtis.
Fifty Shades of Grey: JAMES DEEN as Christian...
Fifty Shades of Grey: didn't like Ruby Sparks but I'm intrigued by Paul Dano...and Chris Messina...
Fifty Shades of Grey: Alex Pettyfer as Christian. Thoughts?
Fifty Shades of Grey: Casting Matt Bomer is the equivalent as casting Jesse Tyler Ferguson...
Fifty Shades of Grey: Channing Tatum, Tom Hardy, Aaron Johnson, Alex Pettyfer, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ian Sommerhalder, Ryan Lochte, Bale...
Fifty Shades of Grey: last reading I saw Ryan Gosling and Carrie Mulligan. But there are problems there. Too old, too young? Unknown as Ana?
Fifty Shades of Grey: I watched fifteen minutes of Armie Hammer in "Mirror Mirror" and thought hot but meh. Can Christian be slightly older?
Fifty Shades of Grey: ultimately who do you want as Christian and Ana (an unknown?) or a star? Or is Christian the star? Or does it matter?
Fifty Shades of Grey: I'm seriously having problems with Matt Bomer as Christian...But why?!?
Fifty Shades of Grey: Insomnia. Looking at the book. Thinking of writing test scenes. Need to picture Christian and Ana. WHO plays them?
JAMES DEEN as Christian and GUS VAN SANT as Dr. Campbell in a scene from THE CANYONS written by Bret Easton Ellis... http://t.co/COBkZtVw
"The subject of the painting is the painting..." Mark Rothko.
"Vertigo" defines the cruel way movies work. It explains more than any other film what it means to be just a spectator, a helpless voyeur.
Why I like "Prometheus": its visual logic and lack of commonsense; its fear of sex; its profound pessimism: we exist only to be destroyed...
Fifty Shades of Grey: in a lot of ways "Vertigo" could be the template...
Vertigo: bored at 17, mildly interested at 28, beyond devastated at 37. From then on I've considered it the most beautiful film ever made...
Thanks to the very cool and supportive @Palihotel on Melrose for letting us shoot a scene from THE CANYONS there yesterday with Nolan Funk.
So "Vertigo" finally tops "Citizen Kane" in the 2012 Sight and Sound poll of the greatest films ever made. I can very easily live with that.
My favorite Gore Vidal tweeter eulogy: @bryangreenberg: "RIP Gore Vidal:(" followed by "New Bourne trailer looks dope." Gore would approve.

I'm not going to delete the Ambien induced tweets from last night. Except for the one about Bryan Cranston. He's actually a good actor.
The end is near! Back THE CANYONS movie by sending your pledge to vanguard@me.com or http://t.co/6Ct4iapC. Same rewards as Kickstarter!
You can still back THE CANYONS starring Lindsay Lohan and James Deen by sending your pledge to iVanguard@me.com on http://t.co/Sgdd3EOo.
Note to self: do NOT take Ambien because of current insomnia situation and start tweeting about how much TV sucks. Delete. Delete. Delete...
Ambien is kicking in...erasing the insomnia...I will delete...most of these tweets tomorrow...yawn...zzzzz...where am I?...oh yes...zzzzzzzz
"Dexter" sucks big time. A high-concept cutesy serial-killer drama that has as much depth and scares as an episode of "American Psycho 2."
Billy Wilder's belief that screenplay is ALL is what limits him as a great filmmaker. Why so many artists go with this idea is depressing.
It's what makes filmmakers and screenwriters kneel at the alter of Billy Wilder. The flaw of his movies is that script is God. It's NOT.
The fallacy of the theory that TV is better than the best movies is that people believe that WRITING is EVERYTHING when in fact it isn't.
Yes, "Friday NIght Lights" and "Mad Men" make the case but compared to the best movies they still seem formulaic and trapped in a system.
And "Breaking Bad" is the most overrated TV series in the history of television. Even though I want to bang the kid with cerebral palsy.
And please don't use "The Wire" as an example. Yes, it's the greatest TV series ever made. But it's a TV series. It's not "Vertigo" guys...
Current TV is NOT better than the best movies. It's just fucking LONGER.
Yeah, right: "Homeland" is better than "The Tree of Life." Yeah: "The Newsroom" is better than "Moneyball." Yeah: "True Blood" is SO GREAT.
What is this shit being disseminated that TV is "better" than movies? Most TV is terrible. ALL network TV is awful. So is most cable. A LIE.
Empire irony: Twin Peaks. Post-Empire earnestness: The Killing. I'm not sure which one is more misguided. Insomnia and Ambien: key factors.
Insomnia encourages binge-TV-watching of The Killing and because I'm an addict I'll have to watch the entire 1st season in the next 5 hours.
Louie hits its third season stride in episodes 4 and 5 where Parker Posey gives an astonishing performance. Ignore earlier comments. Ambien.
Note to self: do NOT take Ambien because of current insomnia situation and start tweeting about favorite records from the 1970s. Delete.
I was re-watching "The Last of Sheila" because someone asked me to write the screenplay for the remake. Conclusion: it shouldn't be remade.
"The Last of Sheila" also contains my favorite cinematic portrayal of a Hollywood screenwriter, played by Richard Benjamin in his prime...
The epitome of all-star 70s chic "The Last of Sheila" (U.S. 1973) is a mind bending murder mystery and my favorite movie about Hollywood...
Fifty Shades of Grey: during meeting someone said maybe a female screenwriter would work better. "But I AM a female screenwriter!" I gasped.
Fifty Shades of Grey: a very positive meeting last week with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti. Seems we're all on the same page.
Good night... http://t.co/y2e5JvfC

The main thing I've learned about people who become actors: they become actors because they don't want to be themselves.
The Dark Knight Rises: the most wrenching image in American movies this year is Tom Hardy's Bane being unmasked and looking hopefully up at?
I think the best acting Christian Bale has done despite the business card scene in American Psycho is when he tells Alfred goodbye in TDKR.
A follower complains that I should "refrain" from tweeting about The Dark Knight Rises. Fuck that. EVERYONE should go see it this weekend...
The Dark Knight Rises: the tragic epic realism that Chris Nolan has given the trilogy is what saves the films from legitimate complaints...
Despite its flaws and the fact that it has to be compared to THE key movie of its era (The Dark Knight) I'm with the The Dark Knight Rises.
Not that it really matters but there was zero love for "The Dark Knight Rises" at the packed Academy screening in Los Angeles tonight.
Fifty Shades of Grey: be a snob, fine. But Christian and Ana's first sex scene is so incredibly erotic if you imagine it cinematically...
Fifty Shades of Grey: definitely need to do something about Christian ripping open condom wrappers with his mouth every time he fucks Ana.
Transparency equals connected.
Fifty Shades of Grey: am obsessing tonight on how to stage that first kiss in The Heathman Hotel elevator. One take, total silence, then...
Fifty Shades of Grey: "Why are you reading that mommy porn again?" a follower asks. "You're better than that trash." Thanks but no, I'm not.
Fifty Shades of Grey: reading it again as a movie. Who am I thinking of as Christian? Who am I thinking of as Ana?
Fifty Shades of Grey: just so I'm totally clear on this, Ian Somerhalder is your first choice as Christian? http://t.co/WWGZF7xB

Tom Cruise playing the lead in "Lunar Park" is going to win him the Oscar. Period. Good night.
I've made my mind up about Lunar Park: Tom Cruise in an indie film plays a recovering novelist/addict battling his demons is a win-win-win.
@DanaBrunetti Inner Goddess has gotten a lot of negative feedback. I'm not sure how to handle it. Need yours and Mike's and EL's thoughts.
Tom Cruise is my first choice to play the lead in "Lunar Park" and I think based on the Roger Avary script will win him a Best Actor Oscar.
Tom Cruise is everyone's first choice for "Lunar Park" and it would win him the Oscar based on Avary's script but I don't think he'll do it.
Director/writer of "Lunar Park" is Roger Avary who has written a great, scary-as-hell script. He plans to shoot in September. Aaron Eckhart?
MARK RUFFALO was so amazing in his few scenes in "Margaret" I think he's my first choice to play the Bret Easton Ellis role in Lunar Park.
I really like Ed Norton and think he would be so perfect as Bret Easton Ellis in Lunar Park. I just don't get why he's so against me. WHY?!?
Fifty Shades of Grey: a question a lot of women ask me: why is Ana a virgin? I have no problems with that but a lot of women do. Thoughts?

Fifty Shades of Grey: Yes, this is Diego Boneta in the role of Jose... http://t.co/NjvbcywV
Fifty Shades of Grey: I would never let the Jose character say "Dios Mio!" especially if DIEGO BONETA gets cast in the role. He'd be great.
Edward Norton was on the short list for the BEE role in Lunar Park when I heard that Norton would NEVER be associated with a BEE project :(
Just found out from a casting director that Edward Norton will NEVER work on anything associated with Bret Easton Ellis. I'm wondering why.

Fifty Shades of Grey: so is this a yes or no for Christian Grey? What are the concerns? http://t.co/GYyNgLXu
The "empress" attitude of the famous Nikki Finke is why this is the end of an era. One of the final nails in the coffin of the Empire. OVER.
Nikki Finke accuses staff in our building of "outing" her to me. A joke. None of them know who the fuck she is. I found out at a dumb party.
Nikki Finke: the hectoring, threatening, vaguely litigious e-mails she sent to our buildings owner and management was a truly awful thing...

Fifty Shades of Grey: And to just get things straight you are or are not interested in AP as Christian Grey: http://t.co/RcZghcpj
Fifty Shades of Grey: or is Matt Bomer the man you really want to play Christian Grey? http://t.co/rm0RhSLo
Fifty Shades of Grey: So is this the top choice for Christian Grey? http://t.co/kKVZvLZp
Fifty Shades of Grey: So: this is who so many of you seem to think should play Christian Grey? http://t.co/ZhoNdX2C
Fifty Shades of Grey: I have to admit the composite drawing of Christian Grey by that British professor looks uncannily like...JAMES DEEN.
Fifty Shades of Grey: a lot of votes for Ian, Matt or Alexander to play Christian. But surprisingly for Ana a lot of votes for an unknown...
Adding up tweets I've received Christian G. should be played by Ian Somerhalder or Matt Bomer or Alexander Skarsgard. Who is being left out?
2012 "actual" Oscars: "Margaret" for picture, director, original screenplay, actress (Anna Paquin), and supporting actress (Jeannie Berlin).
If I'd seen Kenneth Lonergan's "Margaret" last year then it would have been the best film I saw in 2011. A wrenching mesmerizing masterwork.
A very ripped Nolan Funk in one of the first scenes shot for THE CANYONS written by Bret Easton Ellis... http://t.co/pB6KKCGD
After 5 years of delays Kenneth Lonergan's "Margaret" is available. Not sure which cut I just watched but: this is a great American film...
Hey, I'm not that down on "Ted"--I've always thought that Seth MacFarlane is a very funny man as well as being quite physically attractive.
Nikki Finke called one of the agencies that reps me and threatened to sue me AND to destroy them as well. Fortunately the agency was ICM.
Anyone in the movie industry who fears they have to "watch out" for Nikki Finke is a complete and total old-school fucking Hollywood loser.
If I had a back-up for 2012 mid-year best: Sarah Polley's "Take This Waltz"... If I had a back-up for 2012 mid-year worst: "Project X"...
2012 mid-year worst: This Means War, Rock of Ages, John Carter, The Lorax, The Dictator, Dark Shadows, Savages, Bully...
2012 mid-year best: The Kid With A Bike (Belgium), Magic Mike, Chronicle, Prometheus...
The motel room fight amazes and I smiled during the coke-binge chat but even though Seth MacFarlane has some good ideas why is "Ted" so meh?
Ah, life is worth living again: watching The Robert Blake interview with Piers Morgan on CNN...
Fifty Shades of Grey. Okay, back to the matter at hand. Who should play Christian? Who should play Ana? Re-following E.L. James.
@E_L_James Hey E.L. you're in L.A.? I'm in L.A. Want to have a drink or dinner? I'm available...
Just caught some of Mary Harron's "American Psycho" and was surprised how good it is. I'd been lightly dissing it but I'm wrong. Polanski...
Fifty Shades of Grey. What is your most favorite thing about the book and what is your least favorite thing about the book? Specifically...
"The only thing more destructive than a tornado is a family..." Reynolds Price.
The Newsroom: I still think it would be a better show if Eric Cartman replaced Jeff Daniels but Episode #3 wasn't bad...
"To write a novel is to betray it..." Michael Chabon.
The celebrity couple I'm most compelled by right now: Andy Samberg and Joanna Newsom.
Any ideas for songs/scoring over Fifty Shades of Grey? Right now I kind of like the idea of EMA...
Fifty Shades of Grey: have to face the fact that you're going to be making the most intensely erotic "mainstream" American movie ever made.
In Fifty Shades of Grey movie: I want to see as much of Christian's body and erotic pleasure--the hard intense letting go--as much as Ana's.
Everywhere I go women come up to me asking about Fifty Shades of Grey. I just tell them I want to make the movie even more sexually intense.
"Take This Waltz": 2012's most visually exciting scene: an amusement park ride, "Video Killed The Radio Star" and a woman falling in love...
Sarah Polley's "Take This Waltz" is weirdly exquisite and anyone who cares about screen-acting has to see Michelle Williams performance...
Chris Heath almost makes the case for "Shame" in his GQ profile on Fassbender. But I still think the movie is pure opportunistic showbiz.
And, no, I didn't like "Magic Mike" just because you get to see Alex Pettyfer's ass. I'd already seen it.
Magic Mike is being sold by the studio as something it isn't. It's the darkest movie I've seen about where we are now and masterfully made.
Magic Mike: the "celebration" sequence in the Tampa condo during a hurricane sends out such bad vibes but with such subtlety that I froze...
"Magic Mike" is by far the best U.S. movie of 2012. Nothing comes close. Ending doesn't sweeten The New American Hopelessness at its core...
While enduring "The Newsroom" and Jeff Daniel's Empire anguish I just kept wondering: do we ever get to see Dev Patel naked?
What I can't believe watching "The Newsroom" is that Aaron Sorkin and I went to the same shrink.
When something as self-congratulatory bull-shitty as The Newsroom is taken seriously by the people it's about: a narcissist wet-dream spews.
Fake-scene after fake-scene in The Newsroom belongs in some terrible off-Broadway remake of Broadcast News. And where are the tits and ass?
"The Newsroom" thinks that good TV is all about clever-fake click-clackity dialogue. It  forgets that the best TV is all about subtext...
I'm only into 6 minutes of Episode 2 of "The Newsroom" and it's already driving me crazy with dialogue that sounds like Neil Simon on crack.
Note the movie theaters in this great THE CANYONS teaser with awesome song by DUM DUM GIRLS at: http://t.co/GRQZBT0I via @youtube
Reading: "When It Happens To You" by Molly Ringwald..."The Longest Way Home" by Andrew McCarthy..."Fifty Shades of Grey" by E.L. James...
If people only stopped slamming the prose of Fifty Shades of Grey then they could see: a fascinating situation, complex characters, a movie.
Why am I fascinated with Fifty Shades of Grey? Yes, sex. But also because it's about control. The need for it, as well as the illusion.
I picked up "Swamplandia!" by Karen Russell thinking: meh. But the prose is so magical that it forced me to read the book in like one day...
The amazing teaser to THE CANYONS written by BRET EASTON ELLIS with DUM DUM GIRLS singing "Coming Down": http://t.co/GRQZBT0I via @youtube
PHILIP PAVEL as Erik. Final casting news on THE CANYONS next week... http://t.co/8vWgWRtZ
JIM BOEVEN as Jon. THE CANYONS casting continues... http://t.co/cpkBwgyZ
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Reel Around the Fountain" by The Smiths...
To Rome With Love: Ellen Page gives best performance as neurotic LA actress. First hour charms. Then stuck in late-period-Allen movie-hell.
The antiquated Woody Allen: the only technology used by the youngish modern-day cast in the 112 minutes of To Rome With Love is 1 cellphone.
TENILLE HOUSTON as Cynthia. Continuing to announce the casting of THE CANYONS this week. http://t.co/39SYswTq
Regarding Nora Ephron: I'm not sure how I'd feel if the definition of my life was reduced to Meg Ryan faking an orgasm in Katz's Deli.
For those of you confused about Empire vs post-Empire check out The Daily Beast article: Charlie Sheen and The End of Empire. AGAIN...
I didn't connect with everything Nora Ephron made but I met the woman numerous times and she was a lovely, funny, genuine person. Sadness...
The talented fiction writer Wells Tower reveals he's trapped in the Empire by writing about James Deen in the July issue of GQ. It's awful.
Upset that I lied to Benicio at the "Savages" party last night. But I was so shocked when he asked me if I LIKED the movie I was speechless.
AMANDA BROOKS as Gina. Announcing the cast of THE CANYONS this week. http://t.co/34oC7akv
So tired of movies aimed at adults being cartoons where we care about nothing, enjoy the carnage, and are supposed to think it's all ironic.
NOLAN FUNK as Ryan. I'll be announcing the rest of the cast of THE CANYONS this week. http://t.co/8I3fQEwh
The point is, in defending Kubrick as gay, he elevated gay cinematic sensibility to a place where no other American gay filmmaker has.
Full Metal Jacket. The most elaborate and sickening display of Kubrick's misogyny with the murderous Vietnamese girl begging to be killed.
Eyes Wide Shut: If Nicole Kidman played the woman at the orgy Tom Cruise has to save then the movie would have been an operatic tragedy...
If Nicole Kidman played every woman Tom Cruise encounters in his nighttime dream escapades Eyes Wide Shut might be considered a masterpiece.
I would be happy to hear any comments on the Tom Cruise and Alan Cumming scene in "Eyes Wide Shut" and the fact that Cruise never gets laid.
There is more erotic (gay) tension between Keir Dullea and HAL 9000 in "2001" than there is between anyone else in Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre.
2001: HAL 9000 is the bitchiest, most murderous queen in American movies, obsessed with two extremely hot hunky pilot-scientists. SK=GAY...
I admired Aaron Sorkin's tenacity defending the Empire in "The Newsroom" pilot on HBO. And, yes, it thoroughly annoyed the shit out of me...
Why is Jack Nicholson reading a Playgirl magazine in the lobby of The Overlook before his interview with Barry Nelson in SK's The Shining?
Never said Kubrick wasn't a loving husband or father. Only: his films are filled with allusions to homosexuality suggesting a closeted gay.
"Eyes Wide Shut" makes total thematic sense when viewed as the dream-movie of a gay but closeted filmmaker, and starring Tom Cruise no less.
I'm not sure if this is good news or bad news but I just found out that Nikki Finke lives in the same building as I do in West Hollywood...
JAMES DEEN as Christian. I'll be announcing the rest of the cast of THE CANYONS next week. http://t.co/p4IBnOci
ANA'S THEME from FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. E.L. James take note: Dum Dum Girls - Coming Down [OFFICIAL VIDEO]: http://t.co/YxBfli6B via @youtube
Contrasting gay American Stanley Kubrick (he wasn't British, you morons) to Cukor, Ray, Whales, Waters, Van Sant, Minnelli? I mean REALLY?
The fact that Stanley Kubrick might have been gay is actually a big deal: it means that there was at least one great gay American filmmaker.
Missed out on THE CANYONS rewards? http://t.co/2ruV72Il. Back us here: http://t.co/6lfkG1DG. Send pledges to ivanguard@me.com. COOL STUFF.
@E_L_James Please consider me to adapt "Fifty Shades of Grey" for the movies. Hope I'm not off the list. I love Christian and Ana. Respect.
The subtextual PERSONAL meaning of "A Clockwork Orange" actually makes it even more interesting if Stanley Kubrick was, in-fact, a gay man.
I don't believe in guilty pleasures: Alan Parker's "Evita." Perfect melding of role and actress. Those black eyes and that awful ambition...
Fact that Stanley Kubrick was gay seems to piss a lot of dudes off. It's actually fascinating and illuminating. Either way: great filmmaker.
Ryan O'Neal's scenes with the older men in "Barry Lyndon"...and the scenes with Malcolm's mentor in "A Clockwork Orange" grabbing his cock.
Kubrick's gayness: insider proof. It's all there."Ghosts" in The Shining giving blow jobs. Cruise being attacked as gay in Eyes Wide Shut...
THE CANYONS: http://t.co/GRQZBT0I via @youtube
THIS IS ANA'S THEME for FIFTY SHADES OF GREY and we want to use this as the end credits of THE CANYONS: http://t.co/YxBfli6B via @youtube
Rock of Ages: I wanted to leave but screenwriter I was with was purring with pleasure about how there were 20 things wrong with every scene.
Adam Shankman's gayness directing "Rock of Ages" compared to Stanley Kubrick's gayness directing ANYTHING is a very compelling comparison.
Rock of Ages: But I will say that Diego Boneta survives the wreckage and could became a star. The boy-band scenes are the best in the movie.
Rock of Ages: a lavish "family" (PG-13) musical about the Sunset Strip 1987: no coke, no sex, a kind of hugely tacky inept embarrassment.
Rock of Ages: 25-year-old vomits when told best number is Alec Baldwin &amp; Russell Brand singing REO Speedwagon's "Can't Fight This Feeling."
Hebrew translation for "Less Than Zero" is "Men In A Trap." The Japanese translation is: "It Is Snowing Cocaine and Blood in Beverly Hills."
I don't care who's gay and who's not gay but the fact that Stanley Kubrick might be gay makes a fascinating director even more fascinating.
Has anyone heard that Stanley Kubrick was gay? Info from two very good sources that despite wife and kids he had a long-term male partner.
"When someone dies young, everything comes to look like an omen..." Luc Sante.
Girls: Whoever thought that Beyonce's "Halo" could be used to such funny, touching effect? One of my favorite moments in a great 1st season.
Lena Dunham handles the season finale of "Girls" beautifully by completely avoiding the cliche of the typical season finale cliffhanger...
Happy fucking Father's Day.

A very 80's Saturday: Reading Andrew McCarthy's collected travel essays. Seeing "Rock of Ages." Having dinner tonight with Molly Ringwald.
RAGING BULL isn't on NETFLIX???? RAGING BULL isn't on ITUNES????
"A monster is a person who has stopped pretending..." Colson Whitehead.
@iansomerhalder I'm glad you're as excited  by the prospect of "Fifty Shades of Grey" as I am. (I've heard that Angelina is not involved...)
"To cure jealousy is to see it for what it is: a dissatisfaction with self." Joan Didion.
And I'll leave you with this: Mitt Romney as Patrick Bateman: http://t.co/eqct6xLe
I know Ian Somerhalder and how kinky he can be and yes, he's probably Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey, and he will go all-out for it.
Okay, okay: I'm seeing Christian G. in Fifty Shades of Grey as Ian Somerhalder but Paul Denton in The Rules of Attraction keeps haunting me.
Just watched "Alien" and "Aliens" with the 25-year-old. Though impressed, the 25-year-old muttered: "I don't really know whose side I'm on."
Rereading "Fifty Shades of Grey: it's hard for me to think of Ian Somerhalder as Christian G. because I've known him personally for so long.
Noomi Rapace's C-section in "Prometheus" is the most awesome, suspenseful scene in recent American movies. Kicking the seat in front of me.
Shooting THE CANYONS starring James Deen and Lindsay Lohan: July 9-31 in L.A. Could not have dreamed of a better cast. Lindsay nailed it...
And I am beyond thrilled that James Deen and Lindsay Lohan will be playing the parts of Christian and Tara in THE CANYONS by BEE.
James Deen and Lindsay Lohan will star in THE CANYONS.
Not saying Prometheus is a great film (unlike a genuinely perfect film like Alien) but it has serious moviemaking intelligence. That's rare.
When movies deliver the atmosphere and the grandeur and the precision of something like Prometheus: the flaws in the script DO. NOT. MATTER.
Prometheus: big, adult, scary. Its skill and design shame most other movies. Probably the best thing Sir Ridley has done in over 30 years.
I think David Cronenberg is a great idea for directing Fifty Shades of Grey and we worked together on American Psycho in its initial phase.
Thanks to everyone supporting BEE adapting Fifty Shades of Grey: the response has been huge and amazing. Hope E.L. James feels the same way.
Bruce Wagner's "Dead Stars" is a  tragicomic Hollywood epic: obscene, scandalous, heartbreaking. Best American novel I've read in a year...
"What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light..." Matthew 10:27
Hope E.L. James doesn't think I'm being a prankster. I really want to adapt her novels for the screen. Christian Grey is a writer's dream...
Completely committed to adapting Fifty Shades of Grey. This is not a joke. Christian Grey and Ana: potentially great cinematic characters.
Huge thanks to all the backers of THE CANYONS. We start shooting in a month here in L.A. Cast will be announced perhaps as soon as Monday...
Contacted my agent about adapting "Fifty Shades of Grey" and have heard nothing back. But it's a Saturday and Gay Pride, so: understandable.
I'm putting myself out there to write the movie adaptation of "Fifty Shades of Grey"...
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "The Fighter" by Gym Class Heroes featuring Ryan Tedder...
Reading articles about Luka Magnotta while GayPride Weekend music blasts from Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood into my office: yeah!
I'm completely offended by recent articles in the news: Luka Magnotta is a fucking amateur compared to Patrick Bateman.
Continuing with 1970s American movies: the 25-year-old approves of "Smile" (1975) which, despite its flaws, remains a key movie of the era.
Interview with...J A M E S  D E E N: http://t.co/D4DkbREO via @xbiz
I am getting way too many e-mails and texts telling me that Prometheus "sucks major cock"...
These are the last five movies Ridley Scott has directed: Robin Hood, Body of Lies, American Gangster, A Good Year, Kingdom of Heaven...
If Twitter is telling you Who To Follow it should also offer suggestions on Who To Unfollow.
Argument with 25-year-old about The Conversation ended with 25-year-old admitting it would've been better if Kristen Wiig played Harry Caul.
Persuaded 25-year-old to watch the rest of "The Conversation" but after its climax 25-year-old made derisive farting noise and groaned ARGH!
The 25-year-old is totally bored with Coppola's "The Conversation" and an hour into it refuses to watch the rest. Not sure what to do. Hmm.
Fully inhabiting a great character Adam Driver gives one of the most complex, layered, interesting performances by anyone on TV in Girls...
"Girls" has gotten to that place where no matter what happens on the show you're moved by the totality of the creator's vision of the world.
Things I'm thinking about: Lindsay Lohan. Source of Light by Polara. James Deen. Dead Stars by Bruce Wagner: the best 2012 American novel.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "The Fear" by Pulp...
Was about to make a Spring Awakening joke when I remembered: Duncan Sheik wrote all the music and lyrics to American Psycho The Musical.
And I've always thought that Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket was one of the two most influential movies of the 1990s, along with Pulp Fiction.
Wes Anderson's great ad for American Express with Georges Delerue's score from Truffaut's "Day For Night": http://t.co/MsjPlYrZ via @youtube
Wes Anderson's "Hotel Chevalier" is one of the best shorts I've ever seen. I wish he had included it in "The Darjeeling Limited." + NP nude.
Paul Thomas Anderson has made two of the greatest movies of his generation and, unlike Wes Anderson, I'm not afraid to watch them again...
If the early Wes Anderson pictures hold up then I can't think of another American filmmaker who is only 43 and has made four great films...
When I defended Wes Anderson's first 3 "masterpieces" naysayers took me to task. I'm afraid to watch them again. I loved Fantastic Mr. Fox.
Moonrise Kingdom achieves intense whimsical charm that devolves into such oppressive inhuman cuteness I wanted to shoot myself in the head.
The "Moonrise Kingdom" review by Manohla Dargis in The N.Y. Times is the whitest review I have ever read about the whitest movie ever made.
One of my favorite trailers for one of my favorite movies about writers: Reprise (2008, Norway): http://t.co/M8AYt7YI via @youtube
Driving through Highland Park listening to James Blake as the L.A. dusk glows over the palm trees on the 5 heading back into West Hollywood.
2012 best: Chronicle, The Kid With A Bike, The Avengers, This Is Not A Film, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games, Damsels in Distress.
ArcLight. Not one laugh in the first 40 minutes of The Dictator. Flee. Confronted by: whitest line ever for a screening of Moonrise Kingdom.
And no, "Girls" isn't the whitest show on television because: satiric realism, crazy-ass self-awareness, overweight nudity, and Adam Driver.
For thirty minutes every week "Girls" manages to be the most suspenseful show on television.
During Wes Anderson's "Moonrise Kingdom" I kept thinking that this has got to be the whitest movie I have ever seen in my entire life...
Kristen Wiig leaving SNL is like the most depressing thing ever...
Stefon on SNL is probably the funniest character on TV.
So far: Mick Jagger is the best host of SNL all season.
Bruce Wagner's Dead Stars pgs 46-61: our obsession with very young celebrity pussy. One of the most exhilaratingly obscene things I've read.
Who in the fuck were The Wiggles?
Just re-watched Brian DePalma's "Dressed To Kill" (1980) and was yet again amazed by the scares, the skill, the fearlessness of being dumb.
Just reread "The Golden Suicides" script about Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake and whatever actors decide to play them will win Oscars.
The saddest decline of a great American director is Jonathan Demme's after "The Silence of the Lambs"...
What is the most overrated contemporary novel? "Beloved" by Toni Morrison. Thoughts?
I also loved Dark Shadows...when I was 6. When you're 48 and waste 200 million remaking the crap you liked as a kid then there is a problem.
These are the last five films Johnny Depp  starred in: Dark Shadows, The Rum Diary, a Pirates sequel, The Tourist, and Alice in Wonderland.
One of the best songs of the last two decades: Billy Bragg. http://t.co/hTCn818J via @youtube
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Accident Waiting to Happen" by Billy Bragg...
Here we go again. Empire? Post-Empire? Notes on Charlie Sheen and the End of Empire. The Daily Beast. Bret Easton Ellis. You'll understand.
I love Tina Fey but she is completely Empire compared to Lena Dunham's hopeless transparent post-Empire fearlessness. "Date Night" anyone?
I think it's pretty official now that "Girls" is the best and funniest show on television. And that Lena Dunham is a total freaking star...
"Still Holding" by Bruce Wagner is the best novel about Hollywood ever written.
Tonight at The Chat: Bryan Greenberg asks James Deen "Don't I know you?" while Paul Schrader drags me to the pool equals why I live in L.A.
The gayest day ever: looking for new towels; Lady Ga-Ga CD blasting; trying to find CK boxer-briefs; trainer and I talking about best lube.
My favorite female character in American movies is Clarice Starling.
The women characters I most identify in fiction are: Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina, Dolores Haze and Maria Wyeth. Yes, two are suicides...
I always found Holden Caulfield to be a whiny self-absorbed brat. And I think Salinger felt the same way. The most misread book of all time.
For those of you unfamiliar with Frederic Moreau he's the protagonist of the greatest novel ever written: Sentimental Education by Flaubert.
Patrick Melrose is probably the fictional character I most relate to next to Humbert Humbert, Frederic Moreau and of course Patrick Bateman.
"Marvel's The Avengers" is the best-looking 3D movie ever made and it didn't give me a seizure-induced headache. It's also funny and smart.
If you can't appreciate the beautiful fanboy precision that Joss Whedon brought to "The Avengers" (despite its meh-factor) then you're lost.
After witnessing Amira Casar raped by a pitchfork and Rocco Siffredi's penis soaked with menstrual blood I just want to watch Animal House.
Oh, and I really liked Marvel's The Avengers...
Just watched Catherine Breillat's "Anatomy of Hell" (2004) and I finally understood why the French like me.
Cut Copy is one of my favorite bands...
No one has seen these movies but the two most interesting performances of 2012:  Greta Gerwig (Damsels In Distress) and Jack Black (Bernie).
I'm annoyed by the fact that Daphne Guinness says I'm not helping with her Twitter account. At least Kate Upton isn't saying the same thing.
"I've spent the last two years looking for my ex-girlfriend's killer. But no one will do it." Anthony Jeselnik.
"Girls who weren't boys were such a let-down." Edward St. Aubyn, Mother's Milk.
I can't help it. I like this. Most interesting musical response to Adam Yauch's death. RIP MCA: http://t.co/sVT0ciGQ via @youtube
Having sex while "Game of Thrones" is on is a really bad idea.
"The most terrifying verse I know: merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream." Joan Didion, The Last Thing He Wanted.
Adam Yauch: the first celebrity death of the year that has left me completely unmoored...
When you love a book it loves you back.
Marnie masturbating in bathroom (hot!). Elijah says "And your dad is gay!" The best use of Robyn singing "Dancing On My Own" ever. GIRLS 3x.
Men fall in love with their eyes. Women fall in love with their ears.
Was sent the proofs for a very famous British writers new novel. I couldn't find a single interesting sentence so I put it down on page 30.
Pino Donaggio's score for "Carrie" is great because it isn't a horror score and that's why it works. It's an aching 70's teen girl ballad...
Pino Donaggio's score for "Carrie" is one of the greatest horror scores ever written but also one of the greatest movie scores ever.
The prom sequence in Brian DePalma's "Carrie" from beginning to end is one of the greatest, best shot and edited scenes in American film.
"Girls" is exceptionally good. The third episode is a knockout. The best new show on television. And the funniest.
Alex Pettyfer just came over to my office and demanded that I write a script for him about a gigolo. Somehow he, um, managed to convince me.
Somewhere in the late 1980's I almost found myself in a coked-up threesome with Rielle Hunter in my condo on 13th Street in New York.
I spent the better part of a year casually telling people how good this new American band Yuck was until today when I found out they're not.
"Girls" is really good.
Yes, "Smash": the show where one gay character apologizes to another gay character by saying "I brought you some croissants."
In the current issue of Written By (the WGA magazine with sad-faced Gary Ross on the cover) 10 pages are devoted to the creation of "Smash."
The cover of Written By (the WGA magazine) Gary Ross looks at us with sad, pleading eyes psyched at continuing The Hunger Games franchise...
Typical article in Written By (the WGA magazine): "How I Left Hollywood To Beat Ageism And Came To New York To Write Plays And Went Broke."
It amazes me yet again that beautiful but terrible actresses are able to give "great" screen performances by the sheer force of their image.
Written By (The Magazine of The Writers Guild of America) might be the saddest, most relentlessly depressing "magazine" ever published...
If Graham Parker and The Rumour have reunited and Judd Apatow has actually put them in his new movie then Judd Apatow is my new hero.

In honor of 420 watched the new Bob Marley documentary and smoked from a chocolate bong that the 25 year-old won in a pot-shop raffle.
Late to the game: always loved Miranda Lambert but the 25 year-old and I have been obsessing over Pistol Annies "Hell on Heels" for weeks...
WATCH THIS MOVIE: Phantom of the Paradise (1974): Part 1/9: http://t.co/iI1yy21A via @youtube

Watching "The Raid: Redemption" you realize Harvey Weinstein is right: THIS got the same rating as "Bully"?!? There is a total disconnect...
"...a city full of phoney aggressive  fantasists and, of course, a few genuinely unpleasant people with power..." No, this isn't about L.A.
"Of course it was wrong to want to change people, but what else could you possibly want to do with them?" Bad News, Edward St. Aubyn...
The main idea of Bully? "Niceness" solves everything. This is the total lie which ignores the reality of what it means to be a human being.
The funniest thing I've heard in weeks: there's no Pulitzer prize for fiction this year.
Titanic is one of the most obsessive American movies ever made. Even if it sucks at times there is a level of obsession that is undeniable.
For those who keep asking me about Hard Candy? I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Love Patrick Wilson.
Girls: post-Empire Sex and the City. The very very talented Lena Dunham is post-Empire Candace Bushnell but am I too Empire and feeling meh?
Why do people keep asking me about We Need To Talk About Kevin? No, we don't.
..."Meet Me in St. Louis" which is one of the great American films: so ravishingly beautiful and shot and designed I watched it stunned...
Catching up on movies I missed (Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid, The Hospital, Assault on Precinct 13) the best thing I saw all weekend was...
Irvine Welsh tweeted that we once had a drunken "play fight" at Dublin's Clarence Hotel. Fight? I thought he was trying to have sex with me.
"Help I'm Alive" by Metric is getting me to sleep tonight...
The Patrick Melrose novels? Of course start with "Never Mind" the first book in the series which includes the rape of Patrick by his father.
Why did it take me so long to fall in love with the brilliant novels of Edward St. Aubyn? People said they were like BEE but they're better.
I've really tried but it's official: I can't resist "Shahs of Sunset"...
"The Cabin in the Woods" is the funniest movie I've seen in about a year. It might look Empire but it has a gleeful post-Empire sensibility.
"The Cabin in the Woods" might not be great (or meet the hype) but when it explodes into horror-movie nirvana it's sensationally satisfying.
Warning to those seeing The Cabin in the Woods this weekend: It's a crazed stoner-fanboy's paranoid horror-comedy and not that scary. Smile.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Beautiful Loser" by Bob Seger...
There's about thirty minutes of sustained deliriously bloody action-horror in the last half of The Cabin in the Woods. Watch for the Merman.
Greta Gerwig is probably the most interesting young American actress in movies now...

Hollywood in post-Empire free-fall: Watch STAFF MEETING VIDEO: THE MOVIE on Vimeo! http://t.co/5mFjvl2k
The biggest irony in recent American movies: "The Hunger Games" and "Bully" opened within the same week. Guess what every teen liked more?
Bully: I'm talking about the why-can't-we-all-get-along? piano-laden hug-fest from Weinstein & Co and not the sexiest, hottest film of 2001.
Why force-feed students to endure the wistful passive gentleness of "Bully" when you can show them Kinji Fukasaku's "Battle Royale" instead?
Bully: lame public service announcement in love with its own victimization and passivity. Stagey and unpersuasive. Total failure as a doc.
"There is nothing more absurd than properly motivated characters..." filmmaker Walter Hill.
McCabe & Mrs. Miller is too painful to watch because it's one of the great examples of 1970s American filmmaking and that era is long gone.
Best movies of 2012 so far: The Kid With A Bike (Belgium), Chronicle, This Is Not A Film (Iran), The Hunger Games.
"Let's not talk about the good old days, but the bad new ones..." Bertolt Brecht.
Added to The Meh List: Bruce Springsteen dedicating "American Skin (41 Shots)" to Trayvon Martin at a show in Philadelphia last week.
I'm never going to be convinced about the case for Billy Wilder.
Fincher's "Zodiac" isn't about its title subject but about those obsessed with it. So: it's about a movie and the audience who watches it...
Again. For those confused about Empire vs. post-Empire read "Notes on Charlie Sheen and The End of Empire" on The Daily Beast to clarify...
What I mean about a new art form: Jeff, One Lonely Guy by Jeff Ragsdale is really the first example of successful post-Empire reportage yet.
The most powerful reading experience I've had in the last year is a new book called Jeff, One Lonely Guy by Jeff Ragsdale. A new art form...
April 24th: FSG publishes Laurent Binet's HHhH. It's about the plan to assassinate the most dangerous man in Hitler's cabinet. Order it now.
I don't want to oversell the Dardenne's "The Kid with a Bike" but it's about saving a child's life and incredibly moving. Their masterpiece.
Just a fact now: Transparency equals true respect and connection. Anyone who thinks differently: move to Planet Empire and stay scared fake.
Empire: that you can like a person but not like their work yet "have" to keep quiet about it. Post-Empire: Anonymous sources equals idiots.
I think it's very post-Empire that the screenwriter of "ATM" (and "Buried" which I liked) seems cool with the fact that I dissed his movie.
John Carter doesn't really start until Taylor Kitsch is shaved and put into a loincloth. This is about forty minutes in. Then you can leave.
I was told by a couple of people who loathed it that I would hate it too but they were wrong: I'm loving Chad Harbach's The Art of Fielding.
On Sunday night before bed this is my favorite end-of-the-week song: Against Me! - Thrash Unreal (Video): http://t.co/1VJLAQga via @youtube
Final say: It. Was. Dharun. Ravi's. Room. As. Well. The fingerwagging in The New York Times today was so crazy and insensitive that I puked.
Movies this weekend: the high-concept, ridiculous "ATM" that seems like it won first prize in some kind of Orwellian screenwriting contest.
Movies this weekend: Gordon Willis introduces himself as America's greatest cinematographer in "Klute" (1971) with Fonda's weird hammy Bree.
Movies this weekend: Adrian Brody gives a soulful, amazing performance in Tony Kaye's right-on-target but ultimately overwrought Detachment.
Movies this weekend: re-watching Julian Fellowes and Robert Altman's Gosford Park and depressed that this kind of movie isn't made anymore.
Wow. Re-watched one of the greatest American movies ever made: The Last Picture Show. The 25 year-old asked: Did David Lynch direct this?...
There are really few pop songs as good as this even though it's 1979: Graham Parker - Discovering Japan: http://t.co/ZIMryjz9 via @youtube
I shudder to think what really went down between Jason Russell and Jacob Achaye but it clarifies a lot why Jacob said he'd rather be dead...
Jason "Honey Badger" Russell. Yeah, another great role-model. The whole Kony thing seemed off from the get-go. When JR gave it a face? Fail.
FREE DHARUN RAVI. AN OUTRAGEOUS, (AND VAGUELY RACIST) VERDICT. COLLEGE PRANK REWRITTEN AS INVASION OF PRIVACY/BIAS IS RIDICULOUS. SHAMEFUL.
This is one of the toughest performances to pull off but Adam Scott manages a kind of miracle in the very compromised "Friends With Kids"...
Best of 2012: "Chronicle" and "This Is Not A Film" and The Shoes - Time To Dance (Official Video): http://t.co/vLvQIiAU via @youtube
I was bullied. It was awful. But I learned a lot. I learned how to cope. It taught me things: people are cruel, the world sucks. I grew up.
Bullying=Suicide? Personally I blame the parents and an entire culture that indulges a childproof world where pain and losing doesn't exist.
If Tyler Clementi had not killed himself we would have never heard of Dharun Ravi. This is a witch hunt pure and simple and it sickens me...
Dharun Ravi might be a jerk but if a jury convicts him because Tyler Clementi killed himself then the US justice system is seriously fucked.
The best video I've seen in ages. Funny, sexy, raw. Retweet: The Shoes - Time To Dance (Official Video): http://t.co/vLvQIiAU via @youtube
This is arguably the best pop song: The Walker Brothers "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)" 45rpm: http://t.co/uZaCxrdp via @youtube
Much better than Wrecking Ball: Land of Hope And Dreams - Bruce Springsteen - Live in NY City - Legendado: http://t.co/v8dzINKE via @youtube
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "We Take Care of Our Own" by Bruce Springsteen. I'm conflicted but love the bombast.
Dinner with James Frey at The Chateau tonight: talked about how scary German book tours are; how fun Australian book tours are; retirement.
Stunned by how scary/funny/catchy this is. Jake G is awesome: The Shoes - Time To Dance (Official Video): http://t.co/vLvQIiAU via @youtube
Compared notes tonight over dinner with Jonathan Lethem about how ridiculous The Paris Review interviews are conducted and why bother? Ego.
Interview in The Paris Review's 200th issue. The myth of the Brat Pack. Why Glamorama is my best novel. Cocaine. Bisexuality. James Joyce...
Interview in The Paris Review's 200th issue. Feelings about Duran Duran, Jonathan Franzen, Donna Tartt, and people I knew who were murdered.
Interview in The Paris Review's 200th issue. The frantic re-editing of American Psycho. How I got kicked off my high school newspaper. Pain.
I think I really, really like this a lot. The Shoes - Time To Dance (Official Video): http://t.co/vLvQIiAU via @youtube
When the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises is better than any actual movie you've seen so far in 2012 you have to realize the game is up...
After seeing studio bummers this week like Project X and The Lorax I'm going to stop movie-bitching because no one cares anymore. It's over.
At the insistence of the 25 year-old I'm about to get very stoned and head over to Hollywood to see "The Lorax"...
Keeping what might be the new book under wraps for now after last nights inspiration. But am still interested in suggestions and advice...
Please keep sending me ideas... You won't get credit...But they help...
Making new notes. Going to bed. Can't believe this happened. Am I really going to start doing this? PB says yes...
Patrick's favorite movies are Hostel 2 and Chicago...
Patrick is oddly sympathetic to Kirk Cameron...
He hates Dexter because they stole his name...
Patrick loves Celebrity Apprentice and Chopped and the Kardashian's. I think... Housewives of Beverly Hills?... NCIS?... What else?...
Up to 14 pages of notes...
Patrick is most obsessed with Rihanna and then various James Deen co-stars...
12 pages of notes...
Yes, Patrick Bateman would use Blendr...
OK so Sean is gay and living in West Hollywood and Patrick is visiting LA with plans to murder who? Famous actress?Anyone in "Hunger Games"?
Patrick watched Friday the 13th when he was sixteen but... page seven on notes for sequel...
Yes, Sean Bateman is gay. Didn't anyone figure that out?
Patrick hanging with Mumford and Son's... what would happen...
Scribbling notes on PB as hedge fund manager in LA...
Patrick and Gavin Rossdale had a Luis Carruthers moment in the bathroom at Bristol Farms.
Patrick was at party weeks ago where Lindsay Lohan swore she was going to sleep with Beckham. Patrick in L.A. with gay brother Sean? Paul?
Patrick's favorite movie: "The Help"...
Patrick's obsession: Rihanna...
Stalking Gavin Rossdale in a Bristol Farms in West Hollywood...
Hmm...Page 5... Murdering David Beckham in an elevator in Manchester...
Patrick's ideal threesome: Chris Brown and Rihanna...
Patrick wants to bang all the Kardashian sisters... Page four... And then... wait how does Channing Tatum come into play?
Patrick hanging out with Scott Disick and Rob Kardashian...
The first murder is the #Kony2012 guy who Patrick finds out is Andy Dick's boyfriend...
Patrick's scary homo encounter: Kris Humphries at STK...
Patrick's favorite threesome: Rihanna and that girl from Sleigh Bells...
Patrick Bateman running around Central Park listening to Missing Person's "Destination Unknown"...The notes keep flowing...
Patrick Bateman would be obsessed with "Stop and Stare" and anything else by the guy who wrote "Halo"...
That Pavilions is so gay they have free HIV testing in aisle 5...
Patrick Bateman's hero was Michael Hutchence...
Scene where Chris Martin and Patrick Bateman eat waffles and talk about how cool St. Vincent is...and then Patrick slits his throat. Notes.
The other novel I've been thinking about is Sean Bateman as a total fag in West Hollywood where he contracts AIDS in the local Pavillions...
Patrick would complain about spotify and the cloud and tumbler...but he would find victims via Blendr while listening to Beyonce and O.A.R.
Patrick would go on a very long dissertation about Coldplay's oeuvre... His favorite song being "Fix You"...
I've three pages on where Patrick Bateman is now and where he came from. The most violent scene is in a sorority where PB rapes/kills 12...
Patrick's iPad would start speaking to him... Telling him Adele's cover of The Cure drove him to killing, well, just about everybody...
Patrick would talk about Adele and Kanye and KATY PERRY because "Firework" is his favorite song... and then he kills Katy Perry's trainer...
Patrick would post pics of murdered girls on Facebook and either no one would notice or post "Fuck yeah" and that's what I'm thinking about.
How would Patrick Bateman deal with the notion of transparency? Or did he already deal with it in the original? Thoughts as I write notes...
Patrick would hate Obama and for example, go into great detail about the Honey Badger fraudulence of #Kony2012 and he'd love Kim Kardashian.
Patrick's first killing would not have been at Harvard. It would have been before... it would have been his father's mistress...
I would love Patrick dissecting Don Henley's "Building the Perfect Beast"...
Patrick at Harvard listening to The Nylon Curtain... maybe Nebraska... maybe Don Henley...
Well, if this American Psycho sequel pans out I'd get in touch with my agent first but will have to spend the weekend seeing if it works...
Hmmm... Maybe I'll call my publishers on Monday... But have to figure out what the structure is... Definitely murders at prep school and ...
Flashback: Patrick as a teenager and then  moves into college before he gets to New York and how Pierce & Pierce is forced by his dad to...
1:00 AM in L.A. and sitting at my desk finishing a script and suddenly I'm making notes on where Patrick Bateman's now and maybe he could...
Confused: Is the guy running the #Kony2012 campaign also the voice of The Honey Badger? Or is Timothy Treadwell still alive? Anyone know?
"It isn't the camera that loves an actress, or makes her exceptional. It's the intent behind the camera, the awful hope." David Thomson.
Thanks for all the birthday wishes. Here's a gift back: http://t.co/rURD44gR
Introducing James Deen and the post-Empire: http://t.co/r9U8mh5W
Birthday Today: avatar is a reminder of the douchey younger self. Tomorrow it will be replaced by the more current douchey older self...
Soundtrack for birthday: "David Comes to Life" by Fucked Up...
Of the adaptations "The Rules of Attraction" reigns. I didn't have anything to do with it but it is by far the best college movie ever made.
Reading: "The Wrecking Crew" (Kent Hartman)..."The Art of Fielding" (Chad Harbach)..."The Kindly Ones" (Jonathan Littell)...
Join THE CANYONS on Facebook: http://t.co/udjLljTg. News later this week about auditions, open casting... if you can handle it...
The difference between "This Is Not A Film" and its more popular US counterpart "A Separation" is that one is coded and the other is not...
The Iranian "This Is Not A Film" is a far more interesting movie than "A Separation" which seems like a male Lifetime movie by comparison...
After tonight not sure who will win Celebrity Apprentice. Lisa Lampanelli or Penn Jillette? I'm rooting for both. Donald's son: sadly hot.
Don't forget that FSG is publishing Laurent Binet's HHhH, about the plan to assassinate the most dangerous man in Hitler's cabinet this May.
Dana Spiotta's Stone Arabia haunts me (is it the best rock novel since Great Jones Street?) but start with her masterpiece Eat the Document.
The upcoming interview in The Paris Review's 200th issue is probably going to cause some problems but I take full responsibility for them...
The American writer Dana Spiotta has now written three excellent novels in a row. Very few writers, if any, are able to do this. Read her.
The Canyons... http://t.co/gmBOEiAz
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Chances" by Athlete...
I really thought I could sit through anything with Tom Hardy in it. But after contemplating suicide while watching This Means War: um, no...
I'm going to be completely pissed if the movie version of The Lorax doesn't shatter me the way it did when I was kid: devastated, in tears.
It's 1 A.M.: I'm just trying to finish a script, waiting for John Legend to cover Dancing In The Dark on Fallon, while the Xanax kicks in...
Problem: Adele's "21" yearns for a post-Empire transparency that, say, Drake's "Take Care" completely owns. One is coded. The other is not.
Hard to concentrate: Taylor Kitsch on Letterman talking about his homeless days living in a subway, and yet still managed to get to the gym.
Feel vaguely guilty about the fact that I like Adele and think she's very talented and yet I still find "21" to be a really boring record...
Sample dialogue today: "But I thought you weren't going to do porn," I said, when the trainer told me what he did over the weekend.
My favorite website right now is probably hotandbusted.
Just got back from various Oscar parties. It's 6 AM in LA. Consensus: best-produced Oscar show ever. No lawyers, managers or agents thanked.
As I predicted in a Tweet on December 3rd 2011: The Artist will win best picture, best director and best actor. Good night.
This is by far the most streamlined and elegant, best produced, and the simplest Oscar telecast that I've ever seen. The way it should be.
Train In Vain-The Clash. Discovering Japan-Graham Parker. Oliver's Army-Elvis Costello. Respectable Street-XTC. What gets the most votes?
Zoning out on the 2012 Spirit Awards I am suddenly reminded that K'naan's "Fatima" is the best social protest pop song of the last decade...
I'm not entirely convinced: I think Jean Dujardin will and should win. Every Academy member admitted: the Oscars are ridiculous but vital...
Talked to too many Oscar voters tonight who said that they voted for George Clooney for best actor. Jean Dujardin did not come up once...
George Clooney should have won for "Michael Clayton" or "Up In The Air." "The Descendants" just doesn't cut it. Jeez, that glycerin tear!...
Jean Dujardin should win on sheer craft and physicality. My sentimental favorite is Brad Pitt. And if George Clooney wins I might throw-up.
If the Oscars weren't so sentimental Berenice Bejo would beat Octavia Spencer and Jonah Hill would win over the old gay dad with cancer...
Again, for those confused about Empire/post-Empire read The Daily Beast: "Charlie Sheen and The End of Empire." It's just a phrase I use...
The Oscars ARE Empire and yet The Artist is a post-Empire film with a definite post-Empire subtext: it's about adapting to new technology...
I was scolded today for finding the Oscars interesting. The person complained that it was "so Empire" of me and I replied "But I AM Empire."
If you had told me five years ago that a silent black-and-white French film would win Best Picture at the Oscars I would have ignored you...
Laurent Binet's "HHhH" is about the plan to assassinate the most dangerous man in Hitler's cabinet. The best novel I've read in a long time.
Out of curiosity watched The Artist again. Feel kind of the same but there's no getting around the best performance of 2011: Jean Dujardin.
I always loved Cee Lo but "The Voice" makes me like Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera and Blake Shelton in ways that I never thought possible.
At 75 Woody Allen will become the oldest recipient of an Original Screenplay Oscar, beating out last years winner David Seidler who was 73.
I hate to think of what Billy Wilder would make of Terrence Malick...
The Oscar for best Original Screenplay 2011 should probably go to "Warrior" by Cliff Dorfman, which wasn't even nominated.
If people who are making films now are using Billy Wilder as a reference for what makes content work they should be exiled to Planet Empire.
The reason why "Midnight In Paris" is popular is because of its title. It's catchy/bad like The Cheesecake Factory, or Desperate Housewives.
The idea that there are "third-act problems" connected to "first-act problems" is something lawyers and the numbers people came up with...
When Woody Allen wins his third best screenplay Oscar for the truly mediocre Midnight In Paris it's a triumph for white old-man nostalgia...
Whitney Houston. Aren't we all implicated? Didn't we all aid in her demise? Where else did she get the money to buy all that crack and weed?
The "surprise" in "The Bodyguard" that it was Whitney Houston's sister who intended to kill her is no surprise at all if you have sisters...
I'm disappointed that Maya Rudolph didn't do her brilliant Whitney Houston impersonation on SNL tonight. But I get it: too soon, too soon...
Watching Whitney Houston's funeral and Clive Davis speaking at length for the first time, and I've suddenly realized: he's totally gay.
Can we get a reality check here? "The Bodyguard" was a truly dreadful movie.
Watching the kind-of-unbearable Kevin Costner at Whitney Houston's funeral and thinking: Hitchcock and Kubrick never won a directing Oscar.
I'm on page 244 of Laurent Binet's "HHhH" and even though I have eighty pages left, I'm already convinced that it's a great novel.
The three most dreaded words in the English language are: "A friend's play"...
A ghost desires only one thing: to live again.
The trailer for "The Lorax" is the best theatrical trailer since "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."
Has anyone else heard about "Full Service" by Scotty Bowers? It's the most honest, jaw-dropping, sex-filled Hollywood memoir I've ever read.
Wild Flag is a better band than Sleater-Kinney, Quasi, The Minders, Autoclave, Helium and The Spells all put together. This happens rarely.
It's 4 A.M. and I can't sleep because tonight I'm disturbed by the realization that my father completely identified with Michael Corleone...
And, yes, I'll reiterate this: Josh Trank's "Chronicle" is the best American movie I've seen in months...
"140 characters offer plenty of room for getting into trouble" warns The New York Times. Only if an Empire asshole can't deal with a tweet.
Whitney Houston: Yes, somewhere tonight Patrick Bateman is weeping, shocked but not surprised, and ordering three hookers instead of two...
Three boys play football in the cloudy skies above Seattle. The casual splendor of Chronicle kicks Hugo's ass when it comes to movie magic.
Watching the tacky "Interview With A Vampire" but am amazed at how eerily prescient and accurate it was about gay Hollywood parenting...
I really like Kanye/Jay Z's Watch the Throne but my favorite moment from it is actually Frank Ocean beautifully singing "Made In America."
But would I rather watch W.E. again or view James Deen porn again, well, the answer is pretty obvious...
While watching problematic W.E. wondered: if Madonna's name wasn't on the credits would it have been more respected? Very interesting movie.
The James Deen porn is just the actualizing of that female fantasy...
W.E. is about a certain type of packaged media-sold female fantasy, and the projection accompanying it. And, of course, it's about Madonna.
But then so does a lot of the James Deen porn I've been looking at lately...
W.E. taps into female fantasy more vividly than maybe anything I've seen. It's about Jennifer Aniston as much as it's about Wallis Simpson.
Question: why are there no cool gay role models?
Am reading Laurent Binet's historical novel "HHhH" slowly convinced that it might be a masterpiece...
2011: by far the worst movie was Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, but Coriolanus pushed me out sooner, yet not as fast as I Melt With You.
Because of how "The Grey" has been promoted it leaves you unsatisfied. 2012 movies that feel the same: Haywire, Crazy Horse, Contraband...
The Grey: Liam Neeson has never been more powerfully raw than in his last tortured speech, where he rages alone at an uncaring white sky...
The Grey: the long scene where Frank Grillo as Diaz decides to give up is so primal and moving that it almost derails the next two deaths...
The Grey: the scene after the harrowing plane crash where Liam Neeson talks an injured young man into accepting his death had me in tears...
The Grey is NOT a wolves-chase-Liam Neeson movie but a meditation on death with four brilliantly moving scenes where men accept their fates.
Everyone keeps asking me my thoughts on Lana Del Rey but I don't have any. I'm listening to PJ Harvey's last record and thinking about that.
On "Smash" gay guy apologizes to another gay guy with the line: "I brought you croissants" while Debra Messing looks on. Gay Empire Alert.
Plus: this is my favorite photo of the week: http://t.co/ClwdLMo7
The most thrilling network TV moment right now is on "The Voice" when the judges press that red button and the chair twirls around...
Here we go again: not trying to sell Empire. It's just a term I like to use. The Daily Beast: "Charlie Sheen and The End of Empire" essay...
I can't help it: I love "The Voice"... It makes "American Idol" seem so Empire...
"It's all about faith, family and friends," says the actor, photographed in The Polo Lounge at The Beverly Hills Hotel on January 3, 2012...
Am completely fascinated and immersed in Laurent Binet's "HHhH" but am reading it too slowly in order to give it a quote which is due 2/14.
If I had to have a girlfriend it would have to be Liz Phair: no fucking doubt. Hottest woman in rock. Non-black. Where in the hell is she?
Someone just tweeted that if you claim to like Springsteen you're hiding your homosexuality. WTF are you talking about? Bruce MADE me gay...
Weird feeling about Madonna. The songs are great but she needed Nicki, MIA, Cee Lo and LMFAO to back her up? Didn't happen with Springsteen.
Super Bowl interrupted writing of James Deen script.
The 25 year-old likes the tUnE-yArDs "w h o k i l l" while it left me a little cold and made me retreat into my Bob Seger catalog...
Did I actually just see Matthew Broderick do a CAR commercial where he says "...if you don't stop and look around you miss it."?!?
Did I actually just see Matthew Broderick do a car commercial?
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Shining Light" by Ash. Probably one of the most epic pop songs of the last 20 years.
Of all the lies we were told growing up the biggest one has to be: sex isn't everything.
The Avett Brothers "I And Love And You" kills me every time. I avoided it for years but the pain came back when I heard it played tonight...
Just finished 30 pages of the James Deen L.A. noir script. The producer, impressed, texted me: "I should find you more Hebraic porn muses."
The first time I distinctly felt my age was in the digital department of the United Talent Agency offices at 4:53 P.M. on February 3rd 2012.
The 2011 record that made me the happiest and most optimistic despite everything collapsing was Fountains of Wayne's "Sky Full of Holes"...
At a tiny book party in West Hollywood tonight Jack Nicholson shows up solo, looking around for a cigarette. The 25 year-old finds him one.
"Red Light Fever" is maybe Liz Phair's best song and the Liz Phair record it's from is maybe better than Exile From Guyville. Haters: wrong.
Today: Staring at the hundreds of head shots autographed by dead actors, lining the corridor of the Santa Palm car wash in West Hollywood...
Reading: "Stone Arabia" (Dana Spiotta)... "HHhH" (Laurent Binet)... "Conversations With John Schlesinger" (Ian Buruma)...
The Grove: a crowd surrounding a man signing autographs. Curious, we moved closer. Found out it was the guy who does The Honey Badger voice.
The best part of Steven Soderbergh's exercise Haywire is the section with Michael Fassbender stealing the movie with his casual studliness.
Just reread Joan Didion's "Goodbye To All That" and found it more unbearably moving than the hundreds of times I've read it since I was 16.
As I predicted in my December 3rd 2011 tweet: "The Artist" will win the Oscar for best picture, best director and best actor.
For those of you confused about the meaning of Empire/post-Empire: The Daily Beast and read Notes on Charlie Sheen and the End of Empire...
James Deen understands after reading the treatment that he has to film a scene where his mad girlfriend forces him to get it on with a dude.
For those of you who think I'm trying to sell Empire/post-Empire, I'm not. It's just how I see things. James Deen, 25, got it immediately...
James Deen and I talked about his post-Empire popularity, the ups-and-downs of growing up in LA, and the ironic mold making of his own cock.
James Deen and I talked at length about the rape of Monica Bellucci in Gaspar Noe's "Irreversible" while JD ate a scoop of coffee ice-cream.
James Deen ordered a salad and we chatted amiably about the unearned feminist hysteria we both received at certain points in our careers...
Just had a revealing dinner with James Deen: super-smart, funny, perfect for the part. And if he doesn't get it I will be very disappointed.
It took me 47 years to finally understand women. This happened sometime in December.
The woman I'm maybe the most attracted to right now: Erin Burnett.
Whatever its influences are, Vampire Weekend's "Contra" always sounds to me like the whitest damn record ever made. And that's not a diss.
In "The Ecstasy of Influence" by Jonathan Lethem: "Bret, Donna, and Some Others" is maybe the most honest thing anyone has written about me.
The Empire people who complained that Catfish wasn't "real" or felt like "a cheat" missed the point. It didn't matter. It's where we're at.
Catching up on 2011 movies I missed and shouldn't have: Paranormal Activity 3. This series is the epitome of post-Empire horror moviemaking.
Demian Bichir's OK but compared to the crazed desperation Leo gives J. Edgar (another 2011 movie I could've missed) Oscar-voting guilt wins.
Catching up on 2011 movies I missed and could have. A Better Life. Disconcerting slickness feeds on white guilt about a very decent Mexican.
I'm sounding like an old crank because I'm under the delusion that movies still "matter" and transport us in a way no other art form can...
This years Oscar nominations are mostly terrible but the fact that The Tree of Life and Terrence Malick were nominated gives one hope.
The Oscars are a marketing tool but they give an indication of what Hollywood is thinking about itself. 2011 was an awful year for movies...
Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close: what would the victims of 9/11 think of this sentimental kitsch? Truly the most risible movie of 2011...
There were good intentions all around but Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is probably the worst most out-of-touch  movie I have ever seen.
In order for The Oscars to mean anything, if they mean anything at all, they have got to limit the number of best picture nominations to 5.
Getting huge vibes from women about my last Tweet that Alexander Skarsgard is too hot for "me to say 'don't rape me'." Same with James Deen.
But Alexander Skarsgard's suave blue-eyed redneck cruelty gives Straw Dogs a smoldering jolt of sexual electricity. Yes, I just wrote that.
Catching up on 2011 movies I missed and could have: glossy neutered Straw Dogs remake. Rod Lurie lacks the required nihilism to pull it off.
James Deen is my first choice to play Christian or Ryan in LA noir micro budget Paul Schrader movie I'm writing. Nudity and acting a must...
#Sundance: Richard Gere gives the best performance of his career in "Arbitrage" and my congrats go out to Nicholas Jarecki. #arbitrage
Watched Taxi Driver again. The 25 year-old (who had never seen it) was shocked at how relevant it still is. It's the key movie of the 1970s.
Catching up on 2011 movies I missed and could have: Attack the Block (U.K.) The film Super 8 should have been but despite its charms: meh...
Catching up on 2011 movies I missed and should have. Fast Five. 132 minutes: only one good chase and Paul Walker doesn't take his shirt off?
Robert Forster overdid it in The Descendant's. The oldest daughter was good in a sitcom role. Matthew Lillard nailed it in the best scene...
Matt Damon has like 4 kids and you could tell this in We Bought A Zoo. I never believed for a minute Clooney had kids in The Descendant's.
We Bought A Zoo: Matt Damon interacted with his kids in a real and intense way compared to the childless George Clooney in The Descendant's.
I now want Jean Dujardin to win because of his adorable Golden Globes speech and playing with the dog on stage rather than King Clooney...
In terms of sheer technique Meryl Streep deserves it even though the sentimental Academy votes black. Jesus, Streep lost to The Blind Side?
If Viola Davis was nominated for best supporting actress she would have been a lock but as actress she's lost in the crowded "The Help"...
George Clooney: more of an actor in Burn After Reading. Jean Dujardin: pulls off an impossible physical riff. Brad Pitt: better than either.
So now it's a two man race between George Clooney and Jean Dujardin. But I really, really want Brad Pitt to upset and win with Moneyball.
Had a conversation on Saturday night with Lindsay Lohan about who was better in Melancholia: Kirsten Dunst or Charlotte Gainsbourg. Guess?
So I guess "Black Swan Green" is my favorite David Mitchell novel...
Cloud Atlas: funny, exciting, imaginative, extraordinarily well-written but it's now starting to strain for greatness and that bums me out.
I'm hitting a wall with "Cloud Atlas": David Mitchell is a literary wizard but too much formal British "playfulness" can become strenuous...
Before bed finishing film treatment for James Deen to star in. He has to act and be full-frontal naked banging girls and guys realistically.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Kids on the Run" by The Tallest Man On Earth (Kristian Matsson)...
We Bought A Zoo: Matt Damon should get an award just for believably not noticing (for two hours!) that Scarlett Johansson wants to fuck him.
How does Matt Damon keep giving strong performances in iffy movies? His 2011 best: We Bought A Zoo, despite its hippie dig-the-animals vibe.
Finished Bill Clegg's "Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man" and wondered: can't someone write an addiction memoir where they stay trashed?
Re: the U.S. Marines urinating on Afghan corpses? I'm sick of hearing that we are a better, more honorable country than that. No. We're not.
Just watched again one of the best rock bio-pics ever made: "Control" (2007, Corbijn, U.K.) Sam Riley as Ian Curtis should have been a star.
To clarify things: "Glamorama" is the best book I've written.
The person my trainer and I talked about the most last week: the career of the porn-star James Deen and what it all means.
Why in the hell wasn't Bennett Miller nominated by the DGA? "Moneyball" was by far the best directed mainstream studio movie of 2011. Crazy.
"First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you." F. Scott Fitzgerald.
1977: Johnny Rotten singing God Save the Queen, Martin Scorsese's "New York, New York" and The Eagle's "Hotel California" hitting number 1.
Aaron Johnson's work in "Kick-Ass" and "Nowhere Boy" and "Albert Nobbs" is one of the reasons you keep watching movies. Passionate, devoted.
Aaron Johnson (most striking British actor under 30) and Mia Wasikowska holding their own against Glenn Close's Jigsaw in "Albert Nobbs"...
"This is what I think now: that the natural state of the sentient adult is a qualified unhappiness." F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Crack-Up.
Final Destination 5: the effects are spectacular, the deaths are bloody and imaginative, and I especially liked Nicholas D'Agosto as Sam...
I know it's hard making the case that Final Destination 5 is "better" than Hugo but on a primal moviegoing level I prefer it in every way...
The homage to Chuck Palahniuk's story "Guts" in The Final Destination (2009) caused relieved laughter because it was so much easier to take.
The Bagghar chase sequence in "The Adventures of Tintin" is the most ecstatic "pure cinema" moment from any movie of 2011. Balletic poetry.
"I avoided writers very carefully because they can perpetuate trouble as no one else can." F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Crack-Up.
My favorite Christmas movie: "1941"...
And perhaps the greatest "new" Christmas song: The Pogue's "Fairytale of New York"...Mike, I miss you...Memories...Rest in peace...
"Christmas Wrapping" by The Waitresses...
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo: an excellent business decision, a beautifully made product for a consortium, the artist given 100 million.
Phil Spector's A Christmas Gift For You: one of the greatest pop records ever made, a symphonic masterwork, a major piece of American art...
Darlene Love singing an amazing version of "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" on David Letterman is the perfect intro to Christmas Eve...
No matter what's nominated for Best Picture 2011 the sad fact remains nothing will come within a 100 miles of The Deer Hunter. #whereweare.
Talented young filmmaker is offended that I called his last film an opportunistic cute-boy-with-cancer flick. Empire sensitivity implosion?
Ryan Gosling looked impeccable eating an apple as he sat down staring quizzically at the 25 year-old who explained to him how Twitter works.
And Joaquin was hanging with Gaspar when we arrived and I forgot to tell him that "I'm Still Here" was probably my favorite movie of 2010...
Ryan came to meet Gaspar Noe who is directing The Golden Suicides. The 25 year-old broke up with me when I said we couldn't stay for dinner.
Chateau tonight: traded laughs with Benecio, met Ryan Gosling, bumped into Colin at the valet and felt eerily like Victor Ward in Glamorama.
Reading: "Cloud Atlas" (David Mitchell)..."The Crack-Up" (F. Scott Fitzgerald)...
Mission Impossible 4: the 25 year-old snickered at most of it yet the 47 year-old me liked it and recognized: it's hard being Tom Cruise...
Lukewarm on "Drive" but it had my favorite sequence of 2011: Gosling in a mask stalking Ron Perlman while Katyna Ranieri sings Oh My Love...
Question asked the most lately: Who could replace Albert Brooks in "Drive" and would have been even more vicious and scarier? Ellen Barkin.
50/50 would have been a much more interesting movie with a hard British actor like James McAvoy in the part than the adorable American JGL.
I would have loved the use of Beyond the Sea during the final minutes of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy if I had a clue as to what was going on.
Ryan Gosling is going to have to wait this year out and then win the Oscar for playing Jeremy Blake in "The Golden Suicides"...
The best thing in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy: the anguished Tom Hardy storyline. He brought a humanity that was totally lacking throughout...
Brad Pitt should get best actor for Moneyball and The Tree of Life, and getting both movies made. He won't but he made a difference in 2011.
The Academy HATED Shame and not Fassbender's fault or dick-size (brave performances from both): it was just an overall reaction to the film.
To clarify the December 3rd tweet about The Artist: the SAG nominations clinched it. The talk in town is (quietly, now) about The Artist...
As I predicted on December 3rd: The Artist will win the Oscar for best picture, best director and best actor. Good night.
Reluctant: put The Tree of Life screener on thinking there's no way it'll play on the small screen but: magically transported once again...
Haters beware: I just had a long discussion with Noble Jones, the writer/director of the "new" American Psycho movie. His take is genuine...
The Tree of Life: the movie I wanted to talk about the most with dudes this year. Yet I found myself lost in conversations about, um, Drive.
Mystified by the Albert Brooks critics wins lately. His awful murder of Bryan Cranston in Drive was truly disturbing but Brooks was miscast.
I begged the studio to cast Anthony Michael Hall as Clay. They gave it to Keanu Reeves. Then fired him for McCarthy because of Mannequin...
The Julian I based that character on would have told the father that he was an idiot and snorted up a line and then fucked his brother...
The father-son tennis court scene in Less Than Zero is so bogus is why Less Than Zero the movie should only be shown on subways and buses...
Robyn's "Body Talk" is something I've been listening to for over a year. It was fantastic seeing her on SNL. A weird revelation. I love her.
Robyn. SNL. Awkward. Real. Probably the best musical guest they've had all season: Call Your Girlfriend and Dancing On My Own equal awesome.
"Young Adult": the best thing Diablo Cody has written, and it's directed by the best American mainstream studio director under 35...
Best performances 2011: Charlize Theron, "Young Adult"...
The Descendant's plays so much better on a TV screen (less forced, less strained) because it's basically a TV movie. Grudgingly gave in...
I am waiting for Scott Disick to ask: "Who in the hell is Bret Easton Ellis?"
I have warned Lionsgate that I will not approve a new version of "American Psycho" unless it stars SCOTT DISICK or MILES FISHER.
Complain to 25-year old that looking at Joe Jonas' tweet-pics was low point of my day. 25-year old says: "I think it was your high point."
Michael Fassbender has been my favorite actor for three years and yet I don't like any of the 2011 movies except for an hour of X-Men...
The snores in the theater, the grumbling in the men's room: this grim, oppressively exquisite thing is so confusing it's almost parodic...
And the LA awards screenings slog forward narrowing the Oscar race: tonight was the next one out of the running: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Fascinating and instructive double feature by an obsessive auteur: Spielberg's "1941" and Spielberg's "War Horse"...
But was very aroused by the scenes between Jeremy Irvine and the hottest damn horse in American cinema history. Alternate title? WhoreHorse?
And all bets are off for Spielberg nominated for anything. I love him and think he's a master showman but the movie is a misconceived fail.
Powerful movie person contact wrong about War Horse: the LA screening was subdued except sustained applause (me too) for dp Janusz Kaminski.
The weak-ass anti-bullying approach: YouTube video with Sia wailing Breathe? I want the kid who growls: "I am gonna break your fucking arm."
The "celebration" of victimization is so widespread in the culture: has it created a generation of overly-sensitive narcissistic snowflakes?
When I was bullied: you manned-up. You learned something. You realized: I'm not getting the gold star. You realized: you lose. Deal with it.
Paul Rudd is the only American actor who seems incapable of giving a bad performance. He has no vanity. Incandescent in Our Idiot Brother...
Best performances 2011: Paul Rudd, "Our Idiot Brother"...
Hold on. Our Idiot Brother? The dumb-looking stoner comedy I avoided last summer is actually the pretty terrific comedy-drama I just rented?
Best performances 2011: Hunter McCraken, "The Tree of Life"...
Best performances 2011: Tom Cullen, Chris New, "Weekend"...
Best performances 2011: Alex Shaffer, "Win-Win"...
Best performances 2011: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, "Bridesmaids"...
Best performances 2011: Ryan Gosling, "Drive"...
Best performance 2011: Steve Coogan, "The Trip"...
Best performances 2011: Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, "Moneyball"...
Best performances 2011: Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Morrison, "Warrior"...
Best performances 2011: Vera Farmiga, "Higher Ground"...
The Artist will win best picture, best director and best actor at the Oscars next year. Good night.
Why didn't Josh Hartnett do The Informers? I don't think he wanted to have sex with Austin Nichols.
I wrote the Graham character in "The Informers" for Josh Harnett. He didn't want to do it.
I would love David Lynch to make "Lunar Park" into a movie. Not going to happen but you can dream...
Roger Avary wrote a great script for Lunar Park and I hope he makes it.
Well, loving Mulholland Drive doesn't mean I want to watch Inland Empire again. But I love Lost Highway and Fire Walk With Me.
Mulholland Drive is such an Empire movie: lavish art-house film made on an epic scale that resonates and gets better over time. Genius...
What sums up Hollywood: Naomi Watts sitting in a coffee shop offering cash to kill the actress she wants to be. A truly devastating movie...
Mulholland Drive: the most emotionally complicated movie ever made about believing in the myth of Hollywood. And a million other things...
You start losing your misogyny when you realize the world is dominated by the messed-up, truly fearful rules of men. An important lesson...
The sexiest movies I saw in 2011 that weren't porno: parts of Uncle Kent, the fake soft-core scenes in Conan The Barbarian and Weekend...
Saw Julia Leigh's "Sleeping Beauty" today and as much as I admired the performances and filmmaking can't anyone make a fun movie about sex?
As a member of the WGA I'll be voting for "Moneyball" for best adapted screenplay and "Warrior" for best original screenplay and then...um.
"Moneyball" can take care of itself but will the Academy please take a look at "Warrior" again? I know "The Artist" will probably win but...
Just got a text from powerful movie person post-screening: "War Horse is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life."
There are small miracles in Shame: the date scene done in one hold-your-breath take; the tracking jogging shot that ends in Times Square...
Steve McQueen's "Shame" would have been so much more disturbing if Brandon had actually enjoyed the sex.
Biggest moviegoing regret of 2011: missing "A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas" in a theater. It came and went too fast. A big fan of last one.
Okay, yeah, Scorsese makes the case for 3D with the best use of it ever in a full-length feature film but, my God, "Hugo" is so damn boring.
My favorite American modern screen actress ever: Diane Keaton.
I distinctly remember the conversation stopped and I was embarrassed and then we were told that dinner was served. This was seven years ago.
The week Brando died I was at a dinner party in a group that included Keaton. I reminded her of the Brando impression she did in Sleeper...
Reading Diane Keaton's memoir and remembering hanging out with her and Warren Beatty in the VIP box at Rams games. I was in high school...
The National song I'm listening to the most right now: "Lucky You"...
The Tree of Life was the movie of 2011 that I thought about the most...
Horrible Bosses was the comedy I didn't laugh at once in 2011...even though I love Charlie Day...
Hall Pass is the best American comedy of 2011, and the funniest and most classically structured.
Before awards season best of 2011: Moneyball, The Trip (U.K.), Warrior, Weekend (U.K.), L'Amour Fou (France), Hall Pass...
Jean Dujardin will probably win....
George Clooney should have won the Oscar for Michael Clayton and Up In The Air. But if he gets it for this...well, time to grow up...
Payne and Clooney are major artists in American movies but the sitcom fakeout of The Descendants is depressing. But I also hated The Artist.
George Clooney playing Ryan Bingham or Michael Clayton he's peerless. When Payne is writing about assholes he's close. The Descendants, eh.
The most distracting thing about The Descendants? I never believed George or Alexander ever had kids and the result? Everything rang false.
On now: Every shot of Hitchcock's Psycho has a very real kind of awesome humanity. I can't help it: I hated every minute of The Descendants.
If you're dreaming about a house or a hotel you're probably dreaming about your body...
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 months: "You Believed In Me" by Todd Michael Schultz: http://t.co/Ciqh1Mo2...
Unless you are having sex with me please DO NOT give me unpublished manuscripts or ask me to read screenplays that haven't been optioned...
Disconcerting....Check this video out -- What Are Our Young Novelists Up To? http://t.co/0UOZyAlL via @youtube
The American Master's documentary of Woody Allen might be a puff piece but it's endlessly fascinating and reminds me of how Empire I am...
"This was in 1972, in Philadelphia" is the last sentence of the Ann Beattie story "Shifting" and it changed the way I looked at writing...
Flipping through cable: "Nine" my favorite Broadway musical turns into the movie debacle that's flashing in front of me now. Time for bed.
Flipping through cable: "Mamma Mia" has maybe the greatest pop score ever for a musical but why is it one of the shittiest movies ever made?
Scripted becomes scripted reality that morphs into scripted again. "Gigolos" still fascinates. Are the girls this hideous? Is Nick that hot?
Michel Houellebecq has written at least two or maybe three great novels and his latest, "The Map and The Territory" is one of them...
Michel Houellebecq is the most interesting, provocative and important European novelist of my generation. Period. No one else comes close...
CBS President Les Moonves when asked about the Charlie Sheen situation: "Shit happens." A succinct and very post-Empire response. I like it.
I can't help it: most perplexing moviegoing experience of 2011 was at the premiere of The Descendants. Kept being told: "Shut the fuck up."
#sexiestmanalive: Richard Engel...
Stressing for three days about a tense four page scene consisting mostly of non-expository dialogue is suddenly written within five minutes.
Source close to the Golden Globes actually worries that if Ricky Gervais hosts again he will "DWARF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CEREMONY ITSELF."
Finishing script that's The Parallax View meets Singles, which is better, I guess, than the last one I wrote: Bewitched meets The Wire...
I didn't really mind "Tower Heist" because I can basically sit through anything with Casey Affleck in it.
Mario Batali being forced to apologize for his benign Hitler/Stalin comment, and becoming another Free Speech victim? Totally sickening...
I've seen Alexander Skarsgard naked so many times in the locker room of our gym that there's no reason to watch "True Blood" if at all...
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Goodbye To Love" by The Carpenters and its crazy guitar solo by Tony Peluso. Genius.
Continually punishing free speech is probably the most immoral and evil thing about Hollywood. GLAAD using Ratner as whipping boy is ABSURD.
And Michael Fassbender is probably the most handsome "masculine" movie star in world cinema at this point. And he has a really big dick.
Just left screening of Steve McQueen's "Shame" which is the kind of trap movie about sex that the GOP could show before debates.
On Melancholia: Lars von Trier is that weird rarity: one of the world's greatest filmmakers who has never made a great film.
Empire Hollywood gate-keeping at its very old-school worst: Brett Ratner forced to step down from producing Oscars because he said "fag".
Drug dealer thought Q was the daughter of another Joan who had just arrived and Quintana finally said: "No, I'm not Joan River's daughter."
...in thrall of her mom and asking her unending questions while Fleetwood Mac played as she sat calmly in drug dealer's armchair and smiled.
Read Didion's "Blue Nights" twice and it crushes me. Quintana's first night at Bennington me and the campus drug dealer accosted her...
Let Me In: the sequence in the gas station and the spectacular car crash that followed was better than anything in the Swedish version.
I think the American remake of "Let Me In" was FAR better than the Swedish version...
The trailers for "Dragon Tattoo" are better than the totality of most movies.
"I really don't care about the story in a film. I think more about the painting..." Robert Altman. (1971 on "McCabe & Mrs. Miller")...
Polanski's Carnage which I just saw at an AFI screening isn't really much of a movie (it's a play) but it's a masterclass in craftsmanship.
Zodiac: an existential masterpiece that's not about the crimes but about the search for meaning and the ultimate futility of that. Life...
Zodiac: not even Hitchcock was this perverse or discursive. The crimes are over in the first third and then the futile search begins. Great.
Zodiac: the only two people who find the truth are in an airport and they're not even in the movie and then it all slams shut. Devastating.
Zodiac: a meditation on the nature of truth and how it loses us. 3 hours of people trying to find the truth and don't. The human condition.
Can't sleep. The 25 year-old's friends sing Band of Horses The Funeral in the living room, all of them wondering what bar allows jailbait...
Can't sleep. Rarely change my mind about movies. The last time: Fincher's "Zodiac" which I disliked when I first saw it. Now: a masterpiece.
Educated Americans tend to confuse morality and art, and morality for them tends to mean social consciousness which usually equals bad art.
The flaunting of scripted reality on Showtime's "Gigolos" is pretty brazen. Sexy? Gross? Both? Who in the hell else is watching this show?
Waiting for Herman Cain to go totally post-Empire on us and admit: "Hellz yeah I remember harassing those bitches!"
Michel Hazanavicius The Artist makes Mel Brooks Silent Movie (1976) look like a masterpiece and in their way The Weinstein's are very smart.
Reading: "Anne of Hollywood" (Carol Wolper)..."The Map and The Territory" (Michel Houellebecq)..."The Journals of Spalding Gray"...
Legitimate question: just walked out on L.A. screening of The Artist and wondered: am I a Grinch or is it just an unbearably cute flyspeck?
If the son is the death of the father, then the grandson is the rebirth of revenge for the grandfather...
Greatest horror scores: The Fury; The Exorcist; Halloween; The Shining; Psycho; The Silence of the Lambs; Alien; Carrie; Dressed To Kill...
Rereading Salem's Lot: though it remained my favorite Stephen King book for years I can't believe how clunky the dialogue is. Still scary...
I don't really care what he thinks about me but I'm reading James Wolcott's electric memoir "Lucking Out" and seriously loving it. No joke.
This is how your life changes: someone tells you something.
The "dream" of "Eyes Wide Shut" begins when Kidman tells Cruise of her desires and ends with him finding the mask...
Eyes Wide Shut: rainbow references: the name of the shop where he rents the costume; the Rainbow bakery box he brings to the prostitute...
Eyes Wide Shut: the rainbow references: the two girls at the Christmas party who tell Cruise they'll take him to "the end of the rainbow"...
Eyes Wide Shut: the bird motifs (Nick Nightingale, Wren Street, the masks at the orgy)...
The dream of "Eyes Wide Shut" is everywhere: the bird motif, the rainbow refs, the same Christmas tree everywhere, the blue light shining...
Tom Cruise's delusion that he's in control in "Eyes Wide Shut" by always showing his I.D., stressing that he's a doctor, is very touching...
Kubrick re-imagined the books he adapted. Example: Alex in the novel "A Clockwork Orange" is NOT the triumphant victim he is in the film...
Kubrick re-imagined the books he adapted. Example: Barry Lyndon becomes a cad because his girlfriend is a whore. This is NOT in Thackeray.
Eyes Wide Shut: every female wants to have sex with Tom Cruise but they're either crazy, have AIDS, or martyred whores. Kidman's last word?
Like Wendy in "The Shining" Nicole Kidman in "Eyes Wide Shut" is never part of her husband's "dream" movie that plays out in front of us...
Stephen King has very powerful female characters but in Stanley Kubrick's universe they're either passive, whores, nonexistent, murderers...
The original ending of Kubrick's "The Shining" is Danny traumatized in a hospital room still tormented by the ghosts of his Batshit Dad...
The novel "The Shining" has Wendy and Hallorann hanging out together (in the summer!) comforting Danny about the loss of Batshit Dad. Happy?
Stephen King's "The Shining" has as much to do with Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" as the "Less Than Zero" movie had to do with the novel.
"The Shining" is so emotionally complicated (the frustrated artist, the bad marriage, the crazy dad) that it's more fascinating than scary.
"The House of the Devil" (2009) has a spectacularly scary forty-minute sequence where a babysitter just wanders around a house at night...
Carpenter's "The Fog" (1980) earns a place just for the eerie credit sequence alone and Cundey's breathtaking shots of the Pacific at night.
If I was forced to say what the scariest movies are: John Carpenter's "The Thing" (1982), "Alien" (1979) and probably "The Exorcist" (1973).
Movies that scared me as a kid but don't now: "The Devil's Rain" (1975), "The Omen" (1976), "Sssssss" (1973)...
Movies that scared me as a kid but don't now: "Race With the Devil" (1975), "The Reincarnation of Peter Proud" (but sexy), "The Fog" (1980).
Movies that scared me as a kid but don't now: Hell House (1973), The Other (1972), Food of the Gods (1976), Prophecy (1979), Psycho (1960).
Someone actually read my tweet suggestion: Sex and the City 2: Directed by John Carpenter http://t.co/xz9apI6Q via @youtube
Movie deaths that really bothered me as a kid: Alex Kintner being pulled off the raft in "Jaws"...Betty Buckley's at the prom in "Carrie"...
Movie deaths that really bothered as a kid: the first kill in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"...the murder at the end of "Don't Look Now"...
The first horror movie that scared me enough to leave the theater was "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" (U.S. 1973). I was nine.
Scariest movies of 2011: 1/3 of Insidious; the first attack of the Thing in the unnecessary prequel; parts of Stake Land; the Arthur remake.
"Halloween III: Season of the Witch" is actually the most ridiculously disturbing movie in the series. Truly gross. Silver Shamrock rules.
Saw "Halloween" at a screening in 1978 months before it opened, and yet Michael Myers announced on that night: movies will change. They did.
Eric, Tami, Julie Taylor. Tim Riggins. Matt Saracen. Lyla Garrity. Landry Clarke. Tyra Collette. Just a few of the best TV characters. Ever.
"...driving down your freeways...midnite alleys roam...cops in cars, the topless bars...never saw a woman so alone...so alone...so alone..."
Jamey Johnson's "The Guitar Song" is one of the greatest contemporary country records and "My Way To You" is its awesome final track...
Thinking about favorite performances 2011: Spike Jonze in "Moneyball"...
Okay. Common ground with the 25 year-old. In terms of network TV: watching Season 4 of "30 Rock" agree that it's the funniest show on air...
Earlier today: in my car the 25 year-old ejected the last LCD Soundsystem CD, groaning: "Why? Why? Why are you listening to THIS?"...
Fight with the 25 year-old: I was watching "Greenberg" again (I'm obsessed) which the 25 year-old thinks is a completely irritating movie...
I thought I knew his story well but Scorsese's graceful doc made me realize: George Harrison's life was genuinely transcendent and heroic...
The way Zachary Quinto came out was very calm and cool: no bells, no whistles, no handwringing, no apologies, no tears. This is the future.
The 25 year-old channel-surfing and "Pretty Woman" flashes on and  realize both Richard Gere and Julia Roberts became stars playing hookers.
Why haven't more people talked about Scorsese's remarkable George Harrison doc on HBO? Started watching it just because it was on. Amazing.
Pedro Almodovar is that weird rarity: one of the world's greatest filmmakers who has never made a great film.
The Skin I Live In is basically Pedro Almodovar's chic version of The Human Centipede. But I prefer Dieter Laser over Antonio Banderas...
And if he can get away with the sex scenes: it's as hot as fucking hell...
Just finished reading Roger Avary's adaptation of "Glamorama" which he will direct next year. Hilarious, horrific, sad. He's a mad genius.
Reading: "Blood's A Rover" (Ellroy)... "Scar Tissue" (Anthony Kiedis)... "Lightning People" (Christopher Bollen)... "Salem's Lot" (King)...
Is "Friday Night Lights" the best prime-time network one-hour non-cable drama series American TV has ever produced? Why am I thinking it is?
Movies are about atmosphere, tone, an editing shift, that tracking shot... They are not about "information"...
Blasted when it first came out, Woody Allen's "Stardust Memories" is the best meta-movie about celebrity and a work of total Empire genius.
Went to a screening of "Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)" and yeah it's the grossest movie ever made but also kind of likable and charming.
Steve Jobs death is one of post-Empire America's most significant events because the metaphor of it feels so huge...
A pretty remarkable movie anyway you look at it but Andrew Haigh's "Weekend" (U.K.) also might be the greatest film about gay men ever made.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "For The First Time" by The Script...
The moment Rosebud burns is the moment when movies shared a secret with the audience that the film pretends to be unaware of. This is magic.
"Moneyball" is the only movie I've seen so far this year where a paying Los Angeles audience applauded at the end. In tears, me included.
Not that it really needs to be said but Tom Morello has always been a hero of mine. Just a passing thought on a late-night September Friday.
The best thing about "Drive" is its violence. I can't remember an American movie which caused grown men in the audience to recoil vocally...
After seeing Drive today was told: "Sorry, babe, but I'd leave you for Ryan Gosling..." My response: "Um, babe, I'd leave you for him, too."
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "He sucked dick; still didn't get that part" "Married gay" "I have a meeting at FOX tomorrow."
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "Gay" "Makes scripts worse" "Whore" "Douchebag" "Yeah, I'd fuck the little guy that won."
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "Gay" "Super Gay" "Are gays singing 'Hallelujah'?!?" "Gay who date-raped someone I knew."
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "Gay" "Married to a gay" "O.D.'d in Vegas" "Took a dump in my apartment; didn't flush toilet."
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "Gay" "Gay" "Thought San Diego was a state" "Whore" "Can't add" "You'd fuck Kyle Chandler?"
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "Gay" "Gay" "Gay" "Fucking crazy whore" "Stole my car" "Gay whore" "Has never read a book."
Dialogue with 25 year-old watching The Emmys: "Gay" "Gay" "Whore" "coke addict" "Gay" "Fucked my sister" "Gay" "Did heroin with him in 06."
Warrior. Didn't really want to see it but began choking up when "Start A War" plays over the opening. By the end I was sobbing like a bitch.
Argue it's not art and totally shameless but "Warrior" is BY FAR the most exciting and emotionally overwhelming movie I've seen this year...
Why do gays care? Why can't Anderson Cooper stay in the closet? I don't get it. Why would anyone want to come out of it? Leave him alone.
The most tragic thing in the silly "Holocaust Drama" (oh, get over it already) "The Debt" is that Sam Worthington turns into Ciaran Hinds.
And Rob Kardashian looks totally awesome in his new Twitter pic. Yeah, and referencing Bette Midler makes it a West Hollywood kind of day...
Revealing conversation today about what was the saddest pop song to ever reach the Billboard top #5. My choice, out of the blue: "The Rose."
Watching The Shining: one of the most endlessly fascinating Empire movies. That it would never be made today on such a lavish scale: a loss.
Was really looking forward to seeing the world ending and the entire cast of Contagion wiped out. But no, we're saved. Seriously depressing.
"Somewhere Only We Know" is one of the greatest songs of the decade. Jesus, fuck off...
Another perfect pop song: "Perfect Symmetry" by Keane which rivals ABBA at their greatest...that soaring bridge is orgasmic and the choir...
But really My Chemical Romances's "Disenchanted" is the best power-ballad of the last ten years...
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Where Am I Gonna Run To" by Ryan Downe...
And I'm not sorry: Coldplay is awesome. "Lovers In Japan" and "Fix You" and "The Scientist" and "Speed of Sound." Snobs and haters beware...
What's sexier than Bruce Springsteen singing Brilliant Disguise in one take in black and white as the camera moves closer and closer and...
You know you're a douchebag when: you use "You're old" as an insult.
Watching one of the great LA films "Greenberg": Stiller at his best, Harris Savides, Gerwig and Ifans, Musso and Frank's, the party scene...
Another example of why It Gets Worse: The A-List: New York. (Despite Rodiney wailing: "Reichens no loves Rodineys anymores!" in Season One.)
The other night advice from a shrink on if your parents ever fight back with the We-Did-The-Best-We-Could thing: "Um, call them out on it."
Sublime: Matt Berninger's opening The National's Hollywood Bowl concert with a wrenching version of "Runaway" is why you leave your house...
Star Wars blu-ray controversy? The movie's always been shit. I knew it when I was a 13 year-old boy in May '77 and it's still shit now. So?
Remember that September after dinner in Tribeca walking past the barricades at midnight and standing there thinking how small it all looked.
Reading: "Knockemstiff" (Donald Ray Pollock)..."Sag Harbor" (Colson Whitehead)..."The Reclusives" (Mark Damon Puckett)...
Just watched the "Duckling" episode of "Louie" that takes place in Afghanistan and yeah it's sentimental but it's better than most movies...
"...I never give you my number...I only give you my situation..." The opening of "You Never Give Me Your Money" keeps playing everywhere...
Disagreed with famous novelist because "Veronica" was one of the decade's best novels. She disagreed with me because she had never read DFW.
And "You Never Give Me Your Money" keeps playing everywhere. Paul McCartney singing "...and in the middle of negotiations you break down..."
Desert. Dinner with famous novelist. Most overrated writer of our generation? Her choice: Mary Gaitskill. My choice: David Foster Wallace...
Still in the desert; had dinner with the 24-year-old's parents last night which is always semi-relaxed because we're basically the same age.
In the desert; remembered a NY night years ago doing a ton of blow with Jonathan Ames and Jonathan Lethem and talking about bisexuality...
Party in the desert house next door. Everyone singing "The Edge of Glory" and thinking: Lady Gaga works because she's in pain and is rock...
Realized that probably my favorite character in American movies from the last couple of years is Insectosaurus from "Monsters vs. Aliens."
...and haunted by the way Clive Owen says "You writer" to Jude Law in the penultimate scene of "Closer"...
Still in the desert, not thinking about the werewolf script; playing Angry Birds Mooncake Festival instead; sunburned; Ocho tequila...
The rape of Susan George in the original "Straw Dogs" was one of the most powerfully erotic things I had ever seen in movies as a young boy.
Regarding the tame conversation between Don DeLillo and me in the next issue of The Believer: it was a year ago, in Paris, and I was scared.
Greatest last shots of girls walking away from the camera: Natalie Portman in "Closer"...and Scarlet Johansson in "Lost In Translation"...
In the desert, thinking about werewolf script; Ocho tequila; "You Never Give Me Your Money" playing over and over; rerun of "Charmed" on TV.
Can't help it: yeah, there's the kid with cerebral palsy from "Breaking Bad" but I also want to bang Rob Kardashian as well.
Misspelled "DEMI LOVATO" in horror pilot script I'm writing. But none of the producers noticed the difference. "Skyscraper" playing while...
And yet dead during Lone Scherfig's "One Day" I drifted off and thought: wow, is Leni Riefenstahl really the greatest female director ever?
Proven wrong again: Vera Farmiga's beautiful "Higher Ground" had me totally enthralled. And Lady Gaga was epically post-Empire on the VMAs.
VMAs are still so Empire. Not to sound too gay but Katy Perry's "Firework" WAS actually the best video of the year. Rick Ross was my fav...
Two things I told the 24-year-old today: "You is kind. You is smart. You is important" and, after dinner, "Minny don't burn fried chicken."
The "Joan" episode of Louie has a scene between Joan Rivers and Louis CK that is one of the best written things I've seen on TV in months...
L.A. Friday: Posters scream "Don't Talk To Anyone! Don't Touch Anyone!" My trainer explains vampire-porn site idea. Soundtrack: Beach House.
This is the third time I'm giving "Breaking Bad" a chance and yet the only thing I kind of want to do is bang the kid with cerebral palsy.
Floored by the final shot Season 1 of Louie. 24-year-old complains only reason: "you and your friends like the show is YOU'RE ALL Louis CK!"
Reading: "Totally Killer" (Greg Olear)..."The Night of the Gun" (David Carr)..."Light In August" (William Faulkner)...
Debating now: what is the best end of summer song? The Boys of Summer (Don Henley) or Girls in Their Summer Clothes (Bruce Springsteen)?
And no the producers of the script I wrote (Downers Grove) which Darren Criss might (or might not) star in didn't make me write that tweet.
Whatever my problems with Glee have nothing to do with the incredibly talented cast itself. Have tastelessly bashed the show not the actors.
OK, OK, I'm late to the game but Louie is the funniest live-action TV series since The Comeback and has a dozen scenes I wish I'd written.
Fountains of Wayne's "Sky Full of Holes"=indescribably happy. Finally stopped listening to Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti's "Before Today"...
Best documentary I've seen in the last year: "L'amour Fou" (France).
Would love to see an "American Dad" mash-up with "The Help" where Roger plays both the Emma Stone part and the Viola Davis part...
Had a drink with Alex Pettyfer at The Polo Lounge last week. He wants to play Victor Ward in "Glamorama" and admittedly I'm intrigued...
Across The Universe: I can think of few movies whose first half I liked as much as I hated the second half. It all went downhill with Bono.
Just saw "Rise of the Planet of the Apes." Well, it's better than "The Help"...
Finished marathon watching of the black mass that is "Damages: Season 1" which left the 24-year-old completely freaked-out. Serious scares.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Skyscraper" by Demi Lovato...
The smartest analysis on Empire-Post Empire I've yet come across: "In Hell We Will All Burn Brightly" by Brianna Berbenuik on Numero Cinq...
My favorite portrayal of a Hollywood screenwriter is the Richard Benjamin character in "The Last of Sheila" (U.S., 1973, Herbert Ross)...
Watching terrible romantic comedy last night realized Justin has a nice ass and that Mila starred in "American Psycho 2: All American Girl."
Listening to "Haunted" by the Pogues. Realized Cars 2 is the first Pixar movie I haven't seen. No, I won't cop to fathering Scott Disick...
The new Harry Potter movie is by far the best in what has been until now a so-so series (and I'm including the one directed by the Mexican).
Reading: "Shock Value" by Jason Zinoman..."The New Yorker Stories" by Ann Beattie..."Mule" by Tony D'Souza..."The Pack" by Jason Starr...
"Summer (The First Time)" by Bobby Goldsboro...
Watching new Transformers I became distracted by Shia's genuine pain, confusion and annoyance but after 45 minutes it became mine as well.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Beach Baby" by The First Class...
And the unfolding case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn just reinforces my theory that men are no picnic but women are fucking CRAZY...
The case of Mark Halperin: shades of Orwellian Empire in getting suspended over calling Obama a "dick" on, um, Morning Joe? What. The. Fuck?
Reading two books about total Empire, one about a king, one about a jester: "Robert Redford" (Callan) and "See A Little Light" (Bob Mould).
Richard Engel...
Mid-year best of 2011: The Trip (U.K.), Hall Pass, The Tree of Life, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Thailand)...
Tried not to lose my mind during The Green Lantern but then thoughts drifted to: is this really any worse than The Legend of Bagger Vance?
So: the best 2011 U.S. theatrical release is The Trip? From U.K. TV? We get to feel Steve Coogan's pain while the theme from Gattaca plays?
The most beautiful actress in American movies today: Shannyn Sossamon Shannyn Sossamon Shannyn Sossamon Shannyn Sossamon Shannyn Sossamon...
The movie playing over the end credits of "Super 8" has more heart, scares, sweetness and narrative skill than the movie that preceded it...
Random Saturday thoughts. Depressed and concerned that I scored a 41 on the How Empathic Are You? test. Adam Levine: sexiest douchebag ever?
Hungover, watching "The Voice" and getting way too emotionally invested in it, while eating a disgusting pizza the 24 year-old ordered...
The basic problem with making big powerful American movies today is that the best filmmakers are more passionate about losing than winning.
This is the Empire problem: some VAG just tweeted me "But sexting to a minor? Ick." A "minor" in post-Empire? WTF? Sexting minors IS hot...
I'm just grouchy about Weiner having to resign over, um, sexting? A major Empire triumph. But in reality: a post-Empire moral disaster...
I like Woody Allen but despite the success of "Midnight In Paris" (his biggest hit in years) it's a really, really lame, lazy, dumb movie...
Tracy Morgan doesn't have to say sorry for anything. His fake "apology" was funnier than the routine. Empire: politically correct bullshit.
Tonight post-Empire: What is more culturally relevant and funnier? The Republican Debates or The Real Housewives of Orange County Reunion?
Most critically underrated rock album of the 1980's: "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking" by Roger Waters. Side Two: sustained masterpiece...
Anthony Weiner pressured to "seek treatment...to make himself WELL" If that's where we are then every single dude I know needs to join him.
Gay Shame Weekend approaches: go-go boys and drag queens on Absolut vodka floats and HIV rates keep rising. Yeah, it gets so much better...
If Anthony Weiner doesn't resign (and he absolutely shouldn't) this will be a major historical triumph in the post-Empire world...
Watched "No Country For Old Men" last night. Even though it's the Coen's masterpiece it's also by far the most earnest movie they've made...
L.A. driving soundtrack today: Swans. "No Words/No Thoughts." The first song from "My Father Will Guide Me Up A Rope To The Sky"...
Dale Peck in Mischief & Mayhem Books writes about "Imperial Bedrooms" It's the most interesting review I've received in my entire career...
Post-Empire: Anthony Weiner's Twitpics. Empire: Anthony Weiner denying and then crying about them. Question: What do women really expect?
Just watched Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye" and Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography and John Williams score: one of the best 70's films...
Am I the only person who can't get through the Stieg Larsson books even if the original Swedish/European titles are "Men Who Hate Women"?...
For all its flaws and glories Hunter McCracken gives the best male performance by a child in The Tree of Life since Henry Thomas in E.T...
Just showed the 24 year-old "Shampoo" and it resonated and agreed that the last ten minutes are among the best edited in American film...
Kristen Wiig, the funniest woman of her generation, gives the best performance of 2011 in Bridesmaids but why did I feel she was too tamed?
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Waiting for the End" by Linkin Park...
Kirsten Dunst looked a lot sadder when I ran out of coke at an Oscar party 5 years ago than at the Von Trier press conference at Cannes...
Reading: The Man in the Gray Flannel Skirt (Jon-Jon Goulian). The Looming Tower (Lawrence Wright). The Secret History (Donna Tartt).
Post-Empire: Lars Von Trier "admitting" he's a "Nazi" at Cannes. Empire: Manohla Dargis's freakout about this in The New York Times. Please.
The last ever U.S. bookstore appearance of "Bret Easton Ellis" will be held at Skylight Books in Los Angeles on Thursday, May 19th, 2011...
The two key American films of the 2000's: The Dark Knight, Knocked-Up (duh)...
The two key American films of the 1990's: Pulp Fiction, Bottle Rocket...
Is Donald Trump the most adorable person in the news right now? He's absolutely delightful. Calling the Chinese: motherfuckers? I love him.
The worst thing that can happen to an artist is to become afraid of his audience...
Was asked to write something about "Notes on Glee and The Curse of Stereotypes in Gay Culture" but actually I'm really not that interested.
Reading: "The Shape of Things to Come: Prophecy and the American Voice" (Marcus) and "Triksta: Life and Death and New Orleans Rap" (Cohn)...
Kelly Reichardt's "Meek's Cutoff" is the most conceptually intriguing movie playing theatrically in LA now. But why is it so damn boring?
I just finished continuously barfing during the last twenty minutes of the Glee anti-bullying episode. Am officially back in the closet.
Best movies 2011 so far: Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Thailand, Weerasethakul) and Hall Pass (U.S. The Farrelly Brothers)...
David Foster Wallace: not ever going to happen...EVER...
Hated every minute of "Hanna" except for 45 seconds of Eric Bana in his skivvies. Glee haters: fuck off. Reading: Mitchell's "Number9Dream."
As much as I like Jennifer Egan's "A Visit From the Goon Squad" I can't help but feel that Jonathan Franzen's "Freedom" was totally robbed.
Gay Empire: Darren Criss marching around a GAP belting out Thicke's "When I Get You Alone" to CLOSETED Carrot Top lookalike...
Gay post-Empire: Darren Criss singing Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" to lame reaction shots of Chris Colfer. Jolting, subversive, hot, cool...
I hate that shit about "It Gets Better." It doesn't. Retool it. Say "You Get Stronger." The narcissism of gays is out of fucking control...
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it. I'll stop riffing on H.I.Glee and tweet about how boring the collected stories of William Trevor are. Happy?
No, I wasn't drunk last night. I was watching Chris Colfer singing, um, "Le Jazz Hot" and felt like I had suddenly come down with the hivs.
I like the idea of "Glee" but why is it that every time I watch an episode I feel like I've stepped into a puddle of HIV?
Unless Rihanna and Britney are singing anything off Sleigh Bells or Beach House or Janelle Monae or Best Coast then I'm not interested...
Reading: A Visit From the Goon Squad (Jennifer Egan). Listening: Halcyon Digest (Deerhunter). Watching: Celebrity Apprentice. I'm so white.
Somewhere during the last twenty minutes of Part Two of HBO's "Mildred Pierce" the 24 year-old glances at me and asks: "Is Todd Haynes gay?"

The three key American films of the 1970's: Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Nashville...
A critical mass moment in Empire/post-Empire: Sorry, but Rebecca Black is totally post-Empire...
HOW do you fuck up Battle: Los Angeles? It's, um, BATTLE: LOS ANGELES. How do you fuck this up? It's a no-brainer but worst movie in years.
The uncut "Notes On Charlie Sheen and The End of Empire" is up and running on The Daily Beast.
Hall Pass, the funniest American movie in about a year, contains the nastiest visual joke I've ever seen involving a drunk girl sneezing...
Watching a tormented Liam Neeson search the snowy Berlin streets for his lost wife in "Unknown" gives this absurd movie a piercing undertow.
Music tonight. @gotoddgo woke me up and I'm tired but I agree: Taylor Swift's "Speak Now" is a better record than "The Suburbs."
Gregg Alexander could have been the next Todd Rundgren. Watch The New Radical's "You Get What You Give." A new star is born...
In the mood: one of the best video's ever: "Torn" by Natalie Imbruglia...
In the mood: Against Me! "Thrash Unreal."
I love Charlie Sheen.
No one seemed to read my "Jersey Shore" article in January's Playboy except for my trainer but only because he was banging the centerfold...
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Dancing On My Own" by Robyn...
The worst thing that can happen to a man is falling in love with a whore...
The bridge on Mumford & Sons "Little Lion Man" was the most wrenching musical moment of 2010. Their performance on the Grammy's sealed it...
L.A. party last night. Agree: "The Ruins" is a totally underrated horror film, Jason Sudeikis is totally bangable, and Egypt: a disaster...
Just saw a rom-com where Natalie Portman sticks her fingers up Ashton Kutcher's ass. I'm left wondering: why didn't I like this movie more?
My two favorite American movies of 2010: "Toy Story 3" and "I'm Still Here."
Slow weekend. Soup with the 24 year old and Netflix: Going the Distance. Best rom-com in a very long time. Directed by...Nanette Burstein.
Long talk with angry, successful screenwriter yesterday about our admiration for "Somewhere" and how its images have haunted us for weeks...
Post-Empire: Ricky Gervais hosting of the Golden Globes. Empire: Hollywood's reaction. (Downey rails on RG before HIS creepfest intro? WTF?)
Reading: "Don't Cry" (Mary Gaitskill)."The Discomfort Zone" (Jonathan Franzen)."Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art" (Scott McCloud)...
Jennifer Getzinger directed what might be the best episode of "Mad Men" ever: The Suitcase. She should win the DGA. So...well...um...yeah...
Just read somewhere that the massive bird deaths all over the world were caused by angry pigs.
Great performances 2010: Lesley Manville, Another Year. Tahar Rahim, A Prophet. Andrew Garfield in the fake Facebook movie made by old men.
Shark attacks. Earthquakes. Riots. William & Kate. Mercury in retrograde. Why Christmas sucks. My sister's site: www.addictedtoastrology.com
Does Susan Boyle really understand her version of Perfect Day? I guess it doesn't matter. It's the best cover of the song I've ever heard.
David Seidler wrote a great original script "The King's Speech" which will win the best screenplay Oscar. And he's 73. Hollywood: Fuck. Off.
Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse.
Empire movies about post-Empire: The Social Network, Waiting For Superman, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps...
Reading: "A Short History of Women" (Kate Walbert)... "The Double Life Is Twice As Good" (Jonathan Ames)... "Life" (Keith Richards)...

Fascinating and instructive double feature by obsessive auteurs: Gaspar Noe's "Enter the Void" and Peter Jackson's "The Lovely Bones"...
On the final night of the Imperial Bedrooms world tour I find myself on an Italian talk-show with...Phil Collins. Somehow this makes sense.
Italy. Hotel in Turin. Watching the Chilean miners being saved and just realized: I've been on this tour longer than they've been trapped...
Racing back to Frankfurt after Heidelberg appearance listening to iPad wondering: Why do I love Tom DeLonge's voice? Is Pete Townshend gay?
I'm tired of the debate: "Freedom" is the best social-realist novel written since I started publishing books. Rock and roll. Deal with it.
No press today. Strike in Madrid. Reading about the history of DreamWorks in "The Men Who Would Be King" (LaPorte). Supremely depressing.
In Amsterdam, and now in Paris, keep glancing at CNN's segment about Mark Ronson and thinking: he's the most attractive man on the planet...
Reading: Cockpit (Kosinski) and Freedom (Franzen), the best American novel I've read since The Corrections. I remember when he hated me.
Empire: Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" video, Tetris, cocaine. Post-Empire: Katy Perry's "California Girls" video, Angry Birds, cocaine...
Labor Day weekend the misogyny came back: The Real Housewives of New Jersey Reunion Parts 1 & 2 and the season finale of The Real L Word...
Post Empire: last night passing on dinner at Dan Tana's with Richard Kelly to eat soup and watch episodes of Jersey Shore with 23 year old.
Empire: last night meeting Tarantino at The Last Exorcism premiere and talking about Pauline Kael, Norman Mailer and "Less Than Zero"...
Powerful moments from last week: Christopher Hitchens on Charlie Rose and finally feeling Rihanna's piercing chorus in Love The Way You Lie.
Hated every minute of "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" (except for about 45 seconds with Brandon Routh). Excruciating. The geeks were wrong...
At that point in the tour when Robbie Williams "Come Undone" plays nonstop accompanied by images from the video acted out in various hotels.
The first book I bought on my iPad is Rob Sheffield's "Talking to Girls About Duran Duran."

Spacing out during "Salt" and reminded that the most powerful movies are about surrender and loss, and not about control and victory...
Why did I keep giggling at the dialogue in "Inception" and why do I think its "seriousness" makes it one of the silliest movies ever made?
"Love and Anger" by Kate Bush.
Not to sound too much like Bateman but the James Perse t-shirts and hoodies I bought a week ago are the best clothes I've worn in a year...
4th of July: at a party talking with Eli Roth about how wrenching Toy Story 3 was, and comparing notes on how much we cried during it.
Reading Post-Empire: "Both Ways Is The Only Way I Want It" (Maile Meloy)... and Empire: "Mergers and Acquisitions" (Dana Vachon)...
"High Violet" by The National is the best record I've heard in a year. It's the only thing I've listened to on the "Imperial Bedrooms" tour.

Ran into Roger from American Dad at The White Party. "Telephone" blasting, pools of lube, Nacho from Grindr, all of us watching "Dahmer"...
The score from Halloween should be playing over the Sex and the City 2 trailer. "The Girls Are Back in Town"? Girls? GIRLS? WHAT girls? WTF?
Why is the siren call in Bad Romance "I don't wanna be friends..." the sexiest lyric in pop songs this year by about a million miles?
John Mayer in the March Playboy is one of the most interesting, funny and revelatory celebrity interviews I've ever read. He just gets it.
Keep looking at the script...Angelina and Franco for Theresa and Jeremy?...It doesn't matter...I wrote it for them anyway...I just spaced...
The best living film critic, David Thomson, calling the great Red Riding trilogy "better than The Godfather" doesn't lessen its impact.

Finishing "The Golden Suicides" script...staring at the view from my office...Dear Science playing...Mike at a friends in Lake Hollywood...
James Cameron, 60, sees the avatar as a means of freedom and escape. Jason Reitman, 32, sees the avatar as the narcissist's ultimate fuckup.
Andrea Arnold's "Fish Tank" blew me away, easily the best movie since "Inglourious Basterds". I've gotta stop saying "Women can't direct."
Yeah!! Thank God he's finally dead. I've been waiting for this day for-fucking-ever. Party tonight!!!
Got into a fight tonight with a screenwriter about why I think the "Last House On The Left" remake is a better movie than "Precious"...

Fascinating and instructive double feature by obsessive auteurs: Lars Von Trier's "Antichrist" and Nancy Meyer's "It's Complicated."
Up In the Air is the best American movie since Inglourious Basterds. Oscar night 2010: George Clooney, Streep, Christoph Waltz, Mo'Nique...
2012: Socialist epic so deranged and absurd it has long stretches of unintentional genius. L.A. destroyed=most breathtaking cinema of 09.
Obsessed with The National's "Alligator." My favorite record since The National's "Boxer." The only thing I listened to in Palm Springs...
Reading: 2666 (Roberto Bolano), All The Sad Young Literary Men (Keith Gessen), Buddha-Volume One (Osamu Tezuka).
Listening again to everything The Hold Steady recorded. Is this the greatest American band now? They just got me through a rough month.

"District 9" is fucking terrible.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt in "500 Days of Summer" gives the best performance I've seen by an actor in a movie this year.

"Starlight" by Muse.
"Bruno" looks bad but is the funniest film of 09. Gays should be ashamed of themselves and not this movie if they accept what's on LOGO...
An issue: "The Hurt Locker" would have been semi-boring if a man had directed it but knowing a beautiful woman made it: it was riveting...
Reading the novel "Netherland" by Joseph O'Neill, and think the writing is  grand and commanding, but then I'm a very, very white dude.
The song I've listened to the most in the last 5 days: "Halo" by Beyonce.

The Girlfriend Experience--best movie of 09 so far?
This weekend reminded: Slap Shot is the funniest sports movie ever made. Bo Burnham-unbearable. The Jayster can really write short stories.
