I will be voting for public advocate in NY tomorrow, and before I do, I'm going to find out what that means.

I just ate some chicken fingers. They came with fries. Didn't eat all the fries, guess I'm "playing with house money" now.
I've never used the phrase "playing with house money." I'm now going to post a tweet or two where I don't use it correctly.

Was worried that my "brunch menus suck" tweet wouldn't hit hard, but I'm looking at the RTs and see there's 3 reasons I was wrong.
Just deleted a brunch menu pdf from my phone. Not sure how it got there. Brunch menus suck.
@brendonwalsh I'm gonna mention you RTd your own dumb tweet. #FTW
This is tweeting reimagined.

Just ate at a six-seat restaurant in the East Village. Two other people in the place. That means 33⅓% of the people there were @verified #celebs. That's a higher percentage than you'll find  at the Academy Awards.

@MattOswaltVA That or LA Law
How about five unsigned bands for the next #SuperBowl halftime show?! They can each do one song! I bet this happens next year!
Next year's #SuperBowl halftime show is going to be a sideshow of my @ replies.
You guys are upset by the #SuperBowl, I'm upset because I just faved a @iamcolinquinn tweet.
@kateberlant You didn't help things with "librettos"
@kateberlant Not during the #SuperBowl, please.
I've heard about the Gisele 180degree high five. #SuperBowl
My review of the #SuperBowl so far:  Game: very exciting Half-time show: very rocking Ads: very funny
Be the strong one at your #SuperBowl party: stand up and say "let's just switch it over to Todd Barry's Netflix special."
In the ideal #SuperBowl the teams would play four quarters straight through, but bookended with performances by Maroon 5.
Hey! I've been to California! #SuperBowl
No F bombs during the #SuperBowl, please!
Did this happen at your #SuperBowl party? https://t.co/kIcCsDZvwA
If Maroon 5 doesn't do that "Animal" song, I'll donate $5,000 to the charity of my choice. #SuperBowl
If you see a celeb on the street tomorrow holding a large coffee, look at them, point to the coffee, and say "Whoa, a large! Looks like someone did a #SuperBowl commercial!"
Been yelling "Nice Hail Mary" after every pass. #SuperBowl
Go Gators! #SuperBowl
I'm the best person to watch the #SuperBowl with if you want your night ruined.
*Outside The Box* #SuperBowl snack ideas:  - wings - beer - chips
Good luck getting into a cat cafe tonight! #SuperBowl
How about a nice screening of "Roma" for the #SuperBowl halftime show?
If the #SuperBowl ends in a 0-0 tie, I'll donate $5,000 to the charity of my choice.
@eddiepepitone Is that a @iamcolinquinn quote?
It's true. @iamcolinquinn always launches *pre-dawn* Twitter attacks on me. Almost makes me feel empathy for Roger Stone!
@iamcolinquinn I just woke up. More later.
@iamcolinquinn @YouTube Is there video of you looking up Amadeus clips at 4AM?
I may have gotten my B.A. at @UF but I got my Ph.D. onstage at sold out arenas and opera houses around the world.
I love that my cat never uses the expression "there's no *there* there."

I'll tweet about this special for $4,500. https://t.co/YTlUyx0KbT

@joshgondelman I notice this anytime someone comes over.
A lot of people tweeting about some sort of NY Knicks related thing that I don't understand at all. I don't think I can post enough "Starbucks guy running for president" tweets to compete.
"I'll give you Todd Barry tickets if we stop talking about Howard Schultz." https://t.co/x1sNHIZK42
@sammorril I had the same question!
"Definitely Too Cold (But Not As Cold As it Could Be)" - Avril Lavigne https://t.co/3fLLVeBSDo
It's weird, I'm drinking coffee, and our next president was the CEO of Starbucks.
Donald Trump, Jr. is an idiot for writing "S&amp;L" and also I can see how someone could make that mistake.
#Burlington  Feb. 21-23 @vtcomedy   Tickets: https://t.co/gxgOyQgFfn
You guys should just accept that the Starbucks guy is going to be our next president.
@blainecapatch I once stayed at the same hotel as him in Rome. It's true!!!!!!!!!!
@JMScomedy @luisadieznuts Not a Starbucks tweet!
In the past, if I made a typo, I'd delete the tweet and post a corrected version. Now I realize it's wonderfully vulnerable -- and downright attractive --  to just leave the imperfect version up!

@MikeRoyce @netflix @NetflixFR I think someone just asked if they should watch my Netflix special.
"Roma" was a great movie, and it also taught me smoothies existed in 1971.

Spent a solid 80 minutes catching up on emails last night (saw @iamcolinquinn's show)
@iamcolinquinn I think the term is "cutting your losses."
@iamcolinquinn You're correct. Saying your show was "really good" was hyperbole.
Saw @iamcolinquinn's #RedStateBlueState tonight. It was really good, but now I need to figure out how to plug it in a way that insults him - - yet seems light-hearted and *ball busting* -- but also makes you wonder if there's actual hostility between us.
@GaryGulman Can I come in for career day?
In the Netflix #FyreFestival doc, Ja Rule says "it's not fraud, it's false advertising." That's like me saying "I don't get standing ovations. People just leap to their feet in appreciation when I'm done with my arena show." (Apologies for not posting this sooner.)
@anylaurie16 So, same as my ringtone?
@anylaurie16 Hey whoa, I just woke up!
Finally leaving Burlington after 9 hours. Glad I declined airline's offer to pay for a TAXI from Burlington to NY. (seriously) But maybe I cheated myself out of 7 hours of ice driving with a taxi driver who already worked a full day.

@anylaurie16 @Delta I told them to do that.
I'm excited about the #FyreFestival tweets I've blessed you with, as well as the ones that are forthcoming!
If someone booked a comedy festival based on the quality of comedians' #FyreFestival tweets, the lineup would be me and some solid opening acts!
If Ja Rule said to Billy "let's make this the 'Todd Barry's comedy' of music festivals" there would be two documtaries out about how amazing #FyreFestival was!
I want to tweet about how I'm stranded in Vermont for a second night due to canceled flights, but I suspect that would garner a #FyreFestival-attendee level of sympathy!
@AndyRichter https://t.co/6uqGFd9qjx

@scharpling @iamcolinquinn Ooh! I'm scared!
@scharpling It was actually a wonderful commentary on comics not watching standup specials!
If I watch 5 minutes of a friend's standup special, that's equivalent to a non-comic watching the whole thing 10 times in a row.

If I won an award at a show I was hosting, I'd just give the finger to the camera for the next two hours. #GoldenGlobes
Viggo Mortensen and I were staying at the same hotel in Copenhagen years ago. So I should be at the #GoldenGlobes
@jonwurster What's that have to do with the #GoldenGlobes
Amy Poehler's arm slightly blocked the view of the woman texting from the front table. #GoldenGlobes
See, this is why I'm not a famous actor. I couldn't imagine asking the director for another take. #GoldenGlobes
Everyone is going to say HFPA now. #GoldenGlobes
@brendonwalsh You could use a ghostwriter, shithead. #FTW
He's right that anyone can sound like Beethoven. #GoldenGlobes
@kenjeong I haven't forgotten.
I have to leave in about 30 minutes. Will do my best to slam out another 500 amazing #GoldenGlobes tweets before I go.
Idris Alba worked as a bouncer at Caroline's Comedy Club. That means there's a chance I may have met him years ago. That means I should be at the #GoldenGlobes
I have bootlegs of the first 17 mixes. #GoldenGlobes
I'm a synth player and I'm not even bothered by that! #GoldenGlobes
Standing ovation before she walked out! That's Todd Barry style! #GoldenGlobes
@kateberlant Those take a while! #Mansplaining
What kind of new @verified #celebs am I going to get during the #GoldenGlobes2019 ? Poets? Scientists?
Wow. @kenjeong got fucked on this bit. #GoldenGlobes
I make idiosyncratic work. I DO!  #GoldenGlobes
@kateberlant I don't like chunks of tomato. So make sure you make it that way.
Too much hair. Not enough bow tie. #GoldenGlobes
If anyone wants to know what the seating is like for a shitty corporate show, check out the audience at the #GoldenGlobes .
@MeghanMcCain @michaelianblack Oh, I know.
Getting a decent amount of followers from @michaelianblack's insincere suggestion that people follow me. #GoldenGlobes
I've heard great things about "The Americans." Should I be on it? #GoldenGlobes
If I won a #GoldenGlobes the biggest challenge would be thanking "my team" without referring to them as "my team."
I've never watched "Bodyguard." Should I be on it? #GoldenGlobes
I guess the downside of being at the #GoldenGlobes is not being able to follow my live tweeting of the #GoldenGlobes .
@joshgondelman Apologize first!
@joshgondelman I almost tweeted that I didn't know that show. Thief!
@DougBenson @united I'm Premier Gold. I'll take care of this.
Awards shows should be more like Shark Tank. Just get into it! #GoldenGlobes
Hoy shit! Lady GaGa has blue hair! #GoldenGlobes
The #GoldenGlobes are at the Beverly Hilton?! Shit! I'm Gold in the HIlton Honors program! I probably could've gone!!
Oh, that game was at Soldier Field! I sold that place out twice.
Sometimes I think being a kicker in the NFL is the most stressful job in the world, then I realize you could say the same thing about how I go onstage alone in arenas and opera houses across the globe!
Too bad they don't give #GoldenGlobes for ghostwriting. Otherwise I'd probably win one for a little show called...#EscapeAtDannemora .
@JeckelJake @sarahleal123 Two completely different jokes about broken escalators.

Here's the deal:  I'm gonna drink 99 IPAs until around 11:59, then I'll slam a signature cocktail right as the clock strikes midnight.

Hey @iamcolinquinn. When does your show open and close? Also, I'm out of town that whole time.

@Moreguinness @NekoCase I actually tried a sleeping bag!
@NekoCase I live in a studio apartment (for the next few months) She dives under the covers and wakes me up multiple times a night until I'm in a quiet rage. HOW CAN I KEEP HER AWAY FROM MY BED WHEN I DON'T HAVE A DOOR?!! Gonna unfollow u if u don't solve this. Ahahaha

Saw Elon Musk on 60 Minutes. He opened up his patents so other people can make similar cars. Inspired me to open up my Twitter premises. So I guess what I'm saying is, feel free to tweet about "Welcome To Marwen".
My cat just asked me if I got a "Welcome To Marwen" screener.
@MrEricLange Thanks!

@kevinseccia Wow. You're starting to fight back. It's sort of adorable!
@kevinseccia Beginning of what?
Got in concurrent beefs with Aronofsky and Rourke on the set of "The Wrestler." That was a rough three days!
The worst thing I can say to another comic is "you're not big enough for me to beef with." Yep.
I hate to say this, but when you're a @verified #celeb with strong opinions, beefs just come with the territory! I really hate saying that!
#NYC Rare NY headlining show.  December 22nd 8PM  The Loft @CityWineryNYC   Tickets: https://t.co/8XD9zOplnh

@kevinseccia Thanks for not dissing my fans.
@realAlanWelker Figuring that out! Hang tight.
@howardkremer I do a joke in my act where I refer to a pet as "pockets." THIEF! Ahahahahahahahaha.
@ComedyClubBKK Great!
Hey, whatever I need to do to shake off a bad set! https://t.co/gewleLTnh1
@MonicaLewinsky It is true! You were wearing your Shooting Gallery cap. The stunned employees basically formed a circle around the edge of the store and watched you shop! I went unnoticed!
I'm actually good to have a beef with because I'll not only admit I'm wrong, but I'll throw in a $20 iTunes gift card as icing on the cake.
@blainecapatch Had to delete!
I think I know the name of this one. https://t.co/Or4RPC2b8b

@thebrianposehn @davidchang @Megadeth All jokes aside, David, you should put us on the show. Me at the very least.
@davidchang @thebrianposehn @Megadeth I'm getting the feeling I'm not going to be on your show.
@davidchang Deal!
@thebrianposehn @davidchang @Megadeth That's why I prefer bands like R.E.M. Spelling never gets in the way of a friendship.
@thebrianposehn @davidchang Also, it's true we'd have to work around my hatred of tomatoes, but I also won't ask you to revolve shooting dates around Megadeath's touring schedule.
@thebrianposehn @davidchang Maybe Brian and I can work out our differences and both be on the show.
Hey @davidchang. Can I be on the next season of "Ugly Delicious"? I don't like tomatoes, but we can work around that.

Dude at pet store suggested I put orange peels on my kitchen counter to repel my cat. Said I should "eat the orange first." I looked at him with my best John McEnroe face and said "You can't be serious."
@joshgondelman I don't know, based on the EXTREMELY palpable anti-Josh Gondelman vibe that was emanating from him, I'd say mending fences isn't really on the table!

Hey @joshgondelman. Ran into John Oliver on the street today. He didn't mention you, but I still got a strong anti-Josh Gondelman vibe from him!

CUT, PASTE AND TWEET:  Hey, if you're looking for the best Steve Bannon tweets, I STRONGLY suggest you head over to @toddbarry's Twitter page. Great stuff!
I was scheduled to headline the Monterey Pop Festival in June of 1967. Then I found out Steve Bannon was also on the bill. I told them to fuck off.
@AliNotAlli I don't think I would!
If I had tickets to see Eurythmics and found out  Steve Bannon was filling in for Annie Lennox, I would not go to that concert. Yep.
@johnnypemberton U ain't a celeb, bro.
@iamcolinquinn Should've done a retweet with quote, dummy!
@PFTompkins Thanks!
Steve Bannon just asked me to mow his lawn for $2. Told him no. Yep. Gotta take a stand.
@brendonwalsh Hopefully you'd put in a word with your boss! #FTW
If I went to an indie rock show and saw Steve Bannon manning the merch table, I wouldn't buy a beer cozy. Yep.
If I went to a Taco Bell and saw Steve Bannon behind the register, I would move to another line. Yep.
Just did a show with @iamcolinquinn. He tried to give me notes on one of my jokes afterwards. I was like, "um, I'm good!"
I would turn down a movie role if Steve Bannon was also cast. Yep. Gotta take a stand.
@joshgondelman @michaelianblack I consider you a friend!
@brendonwalsh Your career is wall-to-wall bombing. 💣 #FTW
@joshgondelman @michaelianblack I'll plug it, too! $2,500.

The New Yorker Festival should cancel Steve Bannon and use his slot for a roundtable discussion of people who wrote great tweets about them booking him in the first place! YEAH!!!!!!
I would've used "..........." before "FOR ME!" https://t.co/0gd7Pjb6Cp
Tickets for Steve Bannon at the New Yorker Festival are $59! For just another $141 you could see one of my shows!
I did the New Yorker Festival in 2014. I'm retroactively canceling!
I feel like as people drop out they'll be able to add extra shows! https://t.co/jgHBFwPKki

NOTHING worse than seeing something you want on Amazon, but it's one of those "add-on" items, so you make a mental note to order it when you order a bunch of other other shit, but then when that day comes YOU. FORGET. WHAT. THE. ADD-ON. ITEM. WAS.
@michaelianblack Nice *disarm*!

On my way to get coffee in Montreal. Ran into @michaelianblack in elevator. Invited him. He says yes, and walks with me a bit. Suddenly he says "oh shit, I have a call at 1pm. I can't go." Weird that he's anti-gun and I just dodged a bullet!
Just for quiet laughs. https://t.co/A14Dzhx89B
@anylaurie16 Whoa Laurie!
I should be a director and/or cinematographer. https://t.co/aMXJn4cWTj
@RonFunches I don't think we can recreate the magic of London.

@EugeneMirman It seems that way!
This is in my LA hotel room.  No indie bands, you can't crash here. https://t.co/oXOLE7s4vK
@theskylerstone Leave Wed.
Been in LA less than an hour, already heard a dude at coffee shop say "DP" and "second unit." Whoa, LA. Give me a few minutes to adjust!
I'm in talks for this as well. https://t.co/6QQRqB1mKk
Just made a Whole Foods cashier HOWL with laughter when I suggested I'm going on vacation with the 30¢ I saved for being an Amazon Prime member.

Until five minutes ago I didn't know there was an assistant Secretary of State.
I can't believe they actually say "belly pain" in that Linzess commercial.
My kitten just got mad when I tried to clean her litter box. That's like if I got mad at an audience for giving me a 45 minute standing ovation! You KNOW it's just like that!
@AndyKindler @daveccher @AcmeComedyCo I was gonna scare you and say it was me.
Hey @Pipsnacks. Just remembered I never asked you for free popcorn. Apologies! #FreeStuffForTodd
Just had a pleasant conversation about cookie prices with a Whole Foods cashier.
Yes, we KNOW: "the definition of 'insanity' is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." We GOT it.

Facebook should make it harder to accidentally "like" someone's comment. I'm just thinking about people who get all excited because a @verified #celeb "liked" their thing then the "like" was gone before they took a screenshot.

Hey #TonyAwards. I did two performances in the Sam Shepard one-act "4-H Club" at the University of Florida in the low-mid 80's. Should I get fitted for a tuxedo?

Nothing wrong with drinking "cold brew" coffee, but you should still order it as "iced coffee." As in "may I have a large iced coffee" not "may I have a large cold brew." That sounds stupid. If you disagree with this, please delete your Twitter and Instagram accounts.
Working on another tweet about "cold brew." Hopefully dropping it within the hour. .

Thanks to the 300 people who sent me examples of full-length albums that only have 7 tracks. You realized I was literally defining a term and not just making a lighthearted joke. https://t.co/JTaBlIKn1z

When the #SuperBowl is over, do people feel let down? Or is it like one of my shows, where you still have a smile on your face 24 hours later?
When Justin Timberlake told the audience to take out their cell phones, he should've added, "but please don't do this at comedy clubs." #SuperBowl
I don't mind a performance that's a little stripped down, but c'mon! #SuperBowl
No lozenge necessary for this performance! #SuperBowl
I feel like Justin Timberlake has been in the building for quite some time! #SuperBowl
Warning from someone who learned the hard way: if you imply that Pink spit out her gum when it might have actually been a cough drop, people will let you know. #SuperBowl

What's that coach holding a Thai food menu? #SuperBowl
How did the actor Bradley Cooper get #SuperBowl tickets?! Seriously, the actor Bradley Cooper?!
That touchdown seemed unnecessary. #SuperBowl
I invented the RPO. #SuperBowl

It's statically impossible for the Patriots to come back at this point. #SuperBowl
Patriots are getting their asses whooped. #SuperBowl
Might tweet "Go team! Get a touchdown!" every five minutes. #SuperBowl
Please let me be the only person who tweets about Pink spitting her gum out. #SuperBowl
I bet there's people who are so rich, they invite people over to watch the #SuperBowl and they have food laid out and shit.
Everyone Venmo Justin Timberlake $5 during the halftime show. His phone will vibrate like crazy and mess up his performance! #SuperBowl
