Nathaniel “Nat” Turner was an African American slave who led the only successful slave rebellion in US history. The rebellion took place on August 21, 1831, lasting for two days. Turner believed a series of eclipses were a sign from God to start the uprising. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/7XvQvkUfGV
