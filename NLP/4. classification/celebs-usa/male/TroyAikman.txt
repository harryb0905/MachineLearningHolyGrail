As @tometrics explains, the point was the amount of time left in the game...there was not enough time left in the game to count on 2 more possessions for a failed 2-point play. As it turned out, they never even got 1 more possession. Analytics is great but other factors involved https://t.co/r41YQp5mgm

For sure! https://t.co/7osdtsKFUH
Smart by Aaron Rodgers wanting one last play (to throw the incompletion) meaning the FG would be the last play of the game...with 6 seconds on the clock prior the most that can come off the clock is 5 seconds which would’ve given 49ers one last chance chance on the kickoff.

Just thought knowing the importance of the game for the Lions and their need for a pass rusher, we’d see him in a limited role after 17 defensive snaps the previous Monday night. The Lions were probably hoping for that too. He’s one of the greats. https://t.co/oMNg2tVz7U

“Glossed over”? The ball was released from within the pocket w a free rusher and no receiver in the area - intentional grounding. It’s a judgement call as to "facing loss of yardage."  Receiver running the wrong route is not a criteria that bails the QB out. https://t.co/IOuAICQfKb

Outside of 10 guys tops, coaches could've picked their rosters when camp began. They've only been evaluating these guys since May.

You might be on to something! Ha! I prefer coaches. RT @Jasy_3: Is it me or do former QBs make the best analysts?
Packers? RT @DonovanRussell1: Does any NFL team have more injuries to starters than Dallas? @RainerSabinDMN @dmn_george @BloggingTheBoys
Great analysis by Trent Dilfer @tdespn breaking down NE Patriots' linebacking struggles in pass coverage
Haha! QB Club we formed had our own line of clothing...the Zubaz craze! RT @Brew_City_Kid: Please explain this picture. http://t.co/bobo0R3p
Thought it was great! Trust me, none of my passing records will hold up RT @miller_keith19: How do you feel about romo breaking your record?
Good question. Falcons will likely be #1 seed &amp; haven't called a game yet RT @Ttimeturner: When will you and Joe get an ATL falcons game?
Thoughts and prayers are with Jerry Brown's family &amp; friends during this most difficult time.
How great is the @espn 30 on 30 series? Thoroughly enjoyed tonight's documentary on Bo Jackson. #BOKNOWSCLASS

Correction: Redshirt Freshman
Johnny Manziel not deserving of Heisman Trophy because he's a true freshman is the most ridiculous argument I've heard.
Saints @ Giants RT @17hcb: Do you have the Dallas/Cincinnati game Sunday?  Should be a good one!
Heisman Trophy winner RT @timstowe7: What's your thoughts on Johnny Manziel from A&amp;M??
Agree w @junior_miller...too many college bowl games w too many mediocre teams.
Good stuff...lots of footage I'd not seen b4. RT @roughneck48: Watching the triplets sound fx..u were a great leader. Lead with intensity!!
Looks can be deceiving! haha! RT @Stephen04699874: hey u look like u could still play
Board meetings this morning at corporate headquarters in Dallas for @wingstop
Congratulations to Cowboys franchise TD pass leader Tony Romo...he'll own all the records before he's done...if he doesn't already!
If Falcons are going to win their offense will have to do more than they have against NFL's worst ranked defense.
@willmacewen Made me think of '94 immediately...Novacek scores if he doesn't slip on the wet surface.
Saints not getting points on drive before the half is huge...remains 2 possession game and huge momentum shift for Falcons
As QB you know when you make that throw short of GL it's TD or no points at all...can't count on having time to clock the ball.

Norv Turner is the best offensive play-caller in football...not even close.
Def stop the game. RT @KSRYAN1966: @TroyAikman Should they stop the game to acknowledge him and record or should they play on? Thoughts????
No shortage of storylines for Saints/Chargers game!

Now THAT'S funny! RT @HochsRightBicep: Let's make this an elite ref conversation. Either you're me, or you're not.
So tired of the "elite" QB conversation...who cares?! If you win you're elite...if you don't you're not...it's real simple.
Two best referees when I was playing were Red Cashion &amp; Jerry Markbreit...appreciated the way they controlled a game &amp; respected the players
Referee Gene Steratore has always been a referee in command...I've respectfully referred to him as "The Sheriff"...he's one of the best.
NFL has prioritized getting tough on labor over integrity of game but Commissioner is simply a broker for owners http://t.co/fYP4ppee
These games are a joke.
Hope so...never liked it to begin with. #bushleague RT @thecommishes: Is it time to stop icing kickers?
One of Seattle's receivers ran wrong route. You don't put 2 receivers that close together in the endzone or anywhere else for that matter

Convincing? It's UCLA! #GoBruins RT @NathanBrice3000: How did UCLA convince Jim Mora to go back to college?
Re: 12 men on field RT @MikePereira: His foot has to be down. That is right. If his foot is in the air he is not out...new interpretation.

An irresponsible explanation for not wearing protective gear RT @Shanej37: likely to cause more contact in a contact-less game? @USlacrosse
No contact in Ladies LAX? How about getting hit in head w the ball or stick? C'mon there's no rational explanation for not wearing helmets.
Thank you...that's a start! RT @greggpresson: Went through the same thing with my daughter's team.  This may help http://t.co/50Nnar4j

We lost a good man today. Coach Joe has been one of my very special friends in life...I will miss him terribly.
@mypanda333 @jcy18 Don't know who said this but I can assure you it was NOT me.
Would love to see him back on the sideline. RT @sbigblue1969: Do you think Parcells will coach the Saints this year??
Always enjoy Chicago & NYC. RT @Boston_Bred: What's your favorite city to visit and call a game?
Yes, wouldnt trade my UCLA days for anything. RT @JFields50: If you had to do it over would you say no to Jimmy Johnson in college?
Still expect them to contend. RT @GregPotts54: What's an honest expectation for Saints this year with all the distractions RT

@davidalancrow &amp; if Giants hadn't won their last 2 games they wouldn't have gotten in the playoffs &amp; won the Super Bowl. What's your point?
Lots to consider re: Peyton decision...49ers looked to be best fit but don't know all the variables affecting decision &amp; may never know.
Not anymore. RT @USANFL: @lizzylondon Your too nice Troy! That decision sucked! #Broncos have worst offense of those he considered.
Another team RT @imalovelyman: Where do u figure Tebow will fit in the Broncos' plans w Peyton taking his starting job? FB? RB? TE?
Would've loved to see him in the NFC but a good choice. RT @LizzyLondon: What do you think of Manning's decision?
Yes, grand opening for very first Wingstop SPORTS. RT @TheRantingDead: Is it true you're going to be in Brownsville TX tomorrow?
Absolutely, they were top 4 last year without him. RT @BrandonWingo1: do u rate Denver top3 in AFC now, with Peyton?
49ers would be a good fit. RT @WFlyge: Will #49ers sneak in a grab Manning?
Have filled needs w limited cap space. RT @JulianMckelvey: What do u think of cowboys free agent signings so far??

He's already in that conversation. RT @jafilmfan: Would you say that if Brady gets his fourth ring he'll be the greatest ever?
You're beautiful too : ) RT @IrmaWinthrop: @TroyAikman never retweets or answers my questions. Is it bc I don't look like @mariamenounos?
Had a lot of fun filming RT @toddlipani: Just saw teaser for Bridgestone SB commercial. Awesome! I work for Bridgestone & it makes me proud!

Lots of traffic on the 101 going to Candlestick...rain coming down pretty good too.
Saw Eddie Debartolo, Jr in the gym this am...will serve as 49ers honorary captain for coin toss...great 49er teams & players under his watch
Strong winds impact passing game most. RT @SevenwithaT: Why would it be a factor? Rain and strong wind is not exclusive to San Francisco.
Never a factor when I played there but could be tomorrow RT @MandMSportshow: How difficult were the winds in Candlestick?
You too?  RT @thespoiler28: I've been diagnosed with charasthma - so much charisma that it makes it hard to breathe, any advice?

Arrivig at Lambeau http://t.co/6DtynWD7
Getting morning workout in before heading over to Lambeau
Great example of good coverage & Brees throwing away from defender & trusting his receiver would adjust to the throw.
You're kidding, right? RT @jeffreymartens: Didn't need xtra week. Fangio would've done just as good w no xtra ... http://t.co/bMgLjsLP
Vic Fangio has called an excellent game for 49ers defense...showing what an extra week to prepare can do for a team.
Those catches are required to win games in the postseason. RT @Reptilian13: That was a big time pass, tough catch ... http://t.co/nCy5lcGr
@stromile88 Thought is to get to a manageable 3rd down distance but can't become predictable calling a run on every 2nd & long either.
Yes, didn't take THAT many hits! Some epic battles against them. #muchrespect RT @KingG2k11: Remember playing the 49ers in the playoffs?
Nowhere to throw w that kind of protection is impressive coverage by 49ers secondary...giving a lot of different looks.
Good for him...I couldn't pull that combo off. RT @shelbykitchens: What do you think about Moose's shirt/tie combo?
3rd & 3 and Brees takes shot to endzone...that's a confident QB...perfect throw.
49ers not giving up any big throws down field. Brees completing high % of passes. Big play offenses can get frustrated if that continues.
Favorite weekend of the NFL season...can't wait for 49ers/Saints on @NFLONFOX...@daryljohnston on the call says field is best he's ever seen
Congratulations Captain. RT @Murph_clp: Can I get a RT from one of my Cowboys heroes, I was promoted to Captain in the Houston Fire Dept.

Good decision by Landry Jones to return to OU...he'll benefit from the extra year...as will the Sooners of course.
Props to Dean Spanos for making a tough call but the right call. RT @ProFootballTalk: Chargers announce A.J. Smith, Norv Turner will return.

No protections for week 17...league determines the NBC game. RT @Cowboycalebmem: Why did fox not protect the cowboys/giants game?
A beautiful morning in Aspen as we make our way back to Dallas. http://t.co/lGHwEG5D
For the record, Dan Marino has always been my favorite QB but I give Joe Montana the nod for best ever.
Records don't mean much...winning is what matters. RT @judyaj8: Were you sad when any of your records were broken?
Little doubt Drew Brees breaks Marino's record tonight...don't know if Dan is at the game but it'd be pretty cool if he's in attendance.
Aspen-bound for a few days of skiing with my girls...can't wait!
And I always thought it was a hook that wouldn't listen? RT @HankDHaney: ...tried to fix Geyer's slice but he wouldn't listen

Hey- Joe Buck has gotten back in the game! Follow him at @Buck.

Still feel it'll come down to last game between Cowboys/Giants for NFC East title. RT @AaronJaudon: Do u think cowboys will win the east?
A lot has to happen. RT @officialMaximus: Do u think the Eagles can make the playoffs with their remaining schedule as Dallas playing well?
Losing Jimmy was a bigger factor. RT @JimShue45: If they had not put a salary cap in how many more SB's could you guys have won in Dallas?

Sure they do but each generation is different. RT @shane_emerson: Do you think today's players respect the game the way y'all did
No. RT @DCFanaticsBlog: Jerry compared this team to the 90's teams saying they both made stupid mistakes. Doesn't that comparison anger you?
A great one AND one of the all-time great guys too. RT @sbass1310: Do you consider Steve Beuerlein your best backup qb you had?
Can always do more but it is a priority for NFL RT @T_Freezy05: Is the NFL doing enough to both prevent &then treat current/former players?

Yes...good memory. RT @carpettuna: Didn't u bite through your tongue in Arizona on a hit? I think u did complete the pass to Irvin.
Yes. RT @pug185: If you had to bet your life savings, will the Packers run the table?
Afraid so. RT @mgwalks: Did you ever take a shot like the one McCoy just took?
I've run 2 half marathons...will likely run another this spring. RT @carp082288: How many marathons have u run. Ran my first last month.
Thank you. RT @JohnnyTheGrk: Even though I'm 100% Giants Fan, I must say you were one of the best. A true class-act on and off the field.

Couldn't agree more! RT"@gofster1978: Coming from guy in Scotland, saying that Troy Aikman is best QB that ever lived deserves a RT.
That's what I did during the lockout RT"@Bobbyrevolution: Watch the 92 NFC title game in sf. That's what I would do."

Does preseason football make anyone long for the NFL Lockout?! J/K...kinda!
Back from Calif today...great running into UCLA alumns & supporters while on the left coast...don't get that too often in Texas.

@jwitchard - Its likely, but a potential work stoppage could impact whether head coaches will lose their jobs #NFLMobile
@chinnmusic - No. I think they need offensive line help #NFLMobile
@Peridot2681 - The rematch of Pittsburgh & Baltimore #NFLMobile
@thairandolph - Highlight of my career was three World Championships.
@Etrader - Yes its possible, but it becomes a pain tolerance question and long term damage.

Horizontal passing games (West Coast offenses) umpires became target for WR's on crossing routes to pick def backs...became too dangerous.
Long overdue. RT @Adam_Schefter: NFL will permanently move its game umpires to the offensive backfield, starting with this 2010 season.

Having a beautiful snowfall in Dallas this a.m....a precursor to our family ski trip in Aspen this weekend.
@kimberlyreeves It was a great win for them...can't imagine anyone outside of Colts fans not being happy for them.
Congratulations to Sean Payton, Drew Brees and the entire Saints organization...quite a thrill for the city of New Orleans.  Well done!
You're right. That's the only SB that was played in rain @billpearch: Except when the Bears played there in Super Bowl XLI.

Watching Ohio St/Oregon reminds me that the Rose Bowl is the greatest setting in the country for a football game. Man, I miss that place!
Not to my knowledge. Hope you won something good! RT @JamieMitcham: In a heated debate..Have the Cowboys ever worn black uniforms in a game?
Just saw "Up In The Air"...very good.  A recommended move to go see.
RZ Def/Takeaways hurt them but I agree should be lil higher w/ 3rd fewest pts allowed. RT @smitty767: Cowboys' defense below league average?
@ibthegr8 22nd on offense; they're 1st in defense.

Any other Blackberry users experiencing email outage? Thought I'd check before driving myself crazy trying to figure it out.
Awesome!  Nick and his staff do a great job! RT @smileyvol: how good is Neighborhood Services?
I guess they're not too concerned with college basketball players since they're considering expanding March Madness to 96 teams.
NCAA would like for us to believe they're concerned about the kids (too many games) so therefore no playoff system.
College Bowls were once awarded to teams for great years; Now they're awarded for mediocrity. Reasons are clear...more revenue.
Cowboys went from a December punchline to a legitimate playoff contender...all within 3.5 hours.
Joe Montana gets my vote. RT @RicNasty: I agree with ur statement Peyton is the most consistent qb. I'm just curious is he the best ever?
Gotta be impressed with Jags too.  Haven't beat many good teams this year.  This would validate them as a playoff contender.
How many times have we seen this performance from Peyton? The most consistent QB - week in & week out - I've ever seen.

Long flight to San Diego for Padres board meetings in the morning & then back to Dallas in the afternoon.
An exciting win for the Saints today! Congratulations on their 13th win & securing a 1st round bye in the playoffs. Quite impressive!
Watching "The U" on ESPN...this should be good!
Congratulations to 2009 Heisman Trophy Winner Mark Ingram...well deserved!
C'mon Ace! RT @jacobu: RT Remember when Neuheisel said he wanted UCLA fball to achieve same success as UCLA bball? I think they're there
5 finalist for Heisman Trophy are an impressive group. They represent their Universities & families very well. Best of luck to all of 'em!
No. Until the Cowboys win in January they will continue to be questioned fair or not RT @joshviveros: Do u think jerry jones is the problem?
It was a big win for NY. RT @NYSM: All Of New York loved hearing you and joe buck go silent when hixon returned that punt against your boys.
A bit of a stretch! RT @NFLfootballinfo Week 14 will have SB feel w 3 SB rematches Panthers-Patriots, Rams-Titans, Raiders-Redskins
Yes I do RT @JimboGilmour: Do you think Colt will win the Heisman?
Colt McCoy won the '09 Davey O'Brien Award last night. Enjoyed spending time w him & his family. Off 2 Atlanta this a.m. 4 the weekend.

Hey, he's playing great! RT @malloryhoke: Troy Aikman is so in love w Favre... Date night is Friday, try to contain your lust until then.
What was there to be positive about? RT @tjb122982: Joe Buck &Troy Aikman has a beef with the Chicago Bears; nothing but criticism.

Can't get the UCLA game in my hotel room in Minneapolis. Following the game online as best I can.
Makes no sense 2 be in FG range without having 2 gain any yards. RT @Kevonfl: Why not? I think it is much more exciting than NFL.
Among other things, I don't like college football OT rules.
Still running just not through Plano.  Mostly on Katy Trail these days. RT @TAYLOR_corp: I miss u running thru willow bend!!
The Crosstown Rivalry continues tonight! Go Bruins!!!
Sorry, busy week w 3 games in 7 days. Will have them out next week. RT @shureban: What happened to AER Week 11?

Never said GB came out on topRT @jgunder: if  the vikes have chance doesn't that contradict ur statement last week GB won in the favre trade
True for virtually every team. Health is key. RT @Rich66C: If Favre stays healthy, sure.  One good hit could derail it.
Absolutely. No glaring weaknesses on their team. RT @RyanPom: Do you think the Vikes have a good chance for the Superbowl?
Good luck Brown!! RT @rio_shark: Brown Middle School in Forney TX is hosting the district tournament for volleyball.
