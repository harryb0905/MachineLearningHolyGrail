I remember when @bgtennisnation said on ESPN after Rafa won his first @rolandgarros title that he would win 10!!   I looked at him like he was crazy (he is). And now it has been proven Brad. You are wrong.   Rafa better than ever. Simply incroyable.
There is 1 person on the planet that has the game/tactics to truly worry Rafa right NOW on this surface...and he‚Äôs practicing at this moment on grass in Stuttgart
Interesting idea. https://t.co/vlRQbQ0A0K

Beat down City  #NBAFinals
Coming up on @SportsCenter to discuss present and future for @DjokerNole   Can he win calendar Slam?  @ESPNTennis
@rogerfederer 17 majors   @RafaelNadal 14 majors  @DjokerNole 12 majors   I wonder
Crazy  https://t.co/lfYu11EVsc
He's done it
He can barely breathe
2 immortality points saved  Deuce
History point
Novak has tightened up
5-4 Novak will serve for it again
Not just yet says Andy
As soon as match ends I will be on @SportsCenter to break it down   @ESPNTennis
5-2 Djoker
Closing in
Turning into Beat Down City
Yup we've seen this script before CF.  https://t.co/4Q3rQNV9oK
What a get and shot from Djoker off of a great Murray drop shot  4-1 double break
Djoker about to break this wide open
I'm just telling you what I see https://t.co/3Ya5zmnVvt
Yes we do. And @usopen too https://t.co/jB32U1Covc
Murray is not fatiguing   He just can't win long running rallies consistently against Novak.   For that matter, nobody can
Break for Novak 2-1  Look out
Another running point  Another point Djoker
Murray has to pummel the ball as much as possible. Running war=huge edge Djoker
Murray needed that hold to open 3rd set
Only surprise is 2 sets done in just an hour 21  1 set All @rolandgarros final
Novak feeling it now   More movement better ball striking
The more movement there is in the rally, the better chance Novak wins the point
Going big on second is dangerous
Here we go @rolandgarros   @ESPNTennis   2-0 Novak
Break coming @bgtennisnation
Because Novak a better mover side to side
Murray going away from playing middle to Novak backhand. Now moving Novak around. Bad idea
Big hold for Novak to open second set
Yes it is https://t.co/Zq7RRM52x2
Murray points at his head as he wins first set 6-3. Aggressive and brilliant tactics
Call in no way affected Novak return  https://t.co/HdYhfWOs9h
Correct call by chair umpire
This may be just what Novak needs
And if he plays to backhand it's only down the middle.   Working so far 5-2 Murray
Murray playing more balls to Djoker forehand than I've ever seen before
Murray 2/7 on second serve points. Will become bigger factor
Lines people always move during the point
I only work for @ESPN  https://t.co/rCheWzjwSP
Murray on fire early up 4-1 @rolandgarros @ESPNTennis
3-1 Murray
2 more break points for Andy
This could be good   Real Good
Hello.   Murray has come to play
And Murray breaks right back
Djoker breaks at love to open match
Yes https://t.co/uuhju3iEW0
My keys to today's @rolandgarros final coming up live on @SportsCenter at about 8:50am ET. @ESPNTennis
I will be on @SportsCenter tomorrow morning to preview the final @ESPNTennis @rolandgarros
Ok now. @DjokerNole vs @andy_murray in @rolandgarros final. Who you got?  @ESPNTennis
Oops oh yes.  https://t.co/xx7CnqwGvv
Coming up live on @ESPNSportsCentr to discuss the GREATEST OF ALL TIME
Grande Espana @rolandgarros   And that's without Se√±or @RafaelNadal
Same reason women do. To stay warm  https://t.co/gInx7iSVuD
True but typical  https://t.co/mPS8AL3k9O
My pleasure  https://t.co/YwH5WX1uAu
Not exactly. Most doubles specialists well into 30's or 40's   Right @tennistweetscom?? #theking  https://t.co/KXHm2PBDWg
Yes https://t.co/eceD9apZIc
No it does not mean she will win. But she's the favorite &amp; Garbine is enjoying her victory as she should. &amp; 4ever https://t.co/dTBNyhvWsv
The main difference is how often players stay back now in doubles and try to dictate with forehand, especially on clay
Mike signaling to his player box string tension on racket. Needs to adjust
So interesting to watch the evolution of men's doubles. Bryan Bros have seen it all first hand
I enjoyed it immensely thx  https://t.co/yeCHCqXKPy
Hasn't even been 365 days  https://t.co/xFZgyO6zFo
@GarbiMuguruza WON this match
UN REAL  https://t.co/a6p8x0Po2h
Serena is the favorite @Wimbledon
WOW
22 will have to wait. Amazing performance from Mug to win her first major
Triple match point
Huge forehand 30-0
Backhand error again from Serena
As BG would say 50.6 https://t.co/FFqesas6Wz
Serena holds. Can she come off the mat yet again?? 4-5   @ESPNTennis @ESPNSportsCentr
Down the line off both wings has paid off big time for Mug
Another match point gone
Another match point
2 saved by Serena. Deuce
1 match point saved. 1 more
Mug closing in on @rolandgarros title
FYI. I will be on @SportsCenter right after this match to break it down @ESPNTennis
2 breaks to open second set. 1-1
Not a case today of Serena nerves. Played well in first set but Mug off the charts
Monster set from Muguruza. Does she have one more? Serena as we know, will not go away. I'm locked in @ESPNTennis
Set point 3
The bigger the point the harder they hit
Zero fear from either player
Serena keeps a comin
Incredible D from Mug gives her set point
Serena needs to adjust return position
Serving a lot of 1sts to Serena f hand
Double from Mug. Also feeling pressure of return
Humongous from Mug to break for 6-5 lead
5-5 and another double from Serena
Hello
I'm loving this match
Wow forehand up the line from Serena 40-30
Serena being also forced to he big on second
But Mug has come to play   Excellent match
On fire on serve now
Huge hitting from Serena to break back. 4-4
Mug up 4-2
Serena backhand struggles continue
A double gives Mug first break of match. Serena feeling pressure of 2nd serve return  3-2
Trouble here for Serena
Exactement!!!!  https://t.co/yZlsmLdODp
Mug with a big hold for 2-2. Yes that early is big
There is risk going for more in 2nd. First double.
More pace and better direction on Mug serve so far
A very good second serve gets pummeled by Serena. Deuce again
Yes. And @rolandgarros final. And #22. And #4.  https://t.co/fJIV3mvwKv
Unlucky from Serena on that call at deuce
Ace saves breakpoint from Mug
Monster return from SW for another break point
Mug saves a break point with some controlled attacking off forehand
Correct  https://t.co/kHGCzVxvAr
Serena looking relaxed early. Great sign @ESPNTennis @rolandgarros   #22?
9:19am start for @rolandgarros women's final
Yes https://t.co/aj1PMrgkKa

Her ranking at cut off (6 weeks before tourney) not high enough  https://t.co/cNsANKTz9R
Brings up a great question.   Obviously @DjokerNole is @rolandgarros favorite. Who is your second favorite?
Great point. He's got a shot but hasn't played as well this clay court season  https://t.co/xNWGDpDnLf
No @jemelehill and @michaelsmith are back in their chairs https://t.co/66Zs7fvv5u
No idea but I'm guessing it's 8-10 months meaning she will be able to play late this year https://t.co/sm3Ri42BJP

Stunned silence @OracleArena
That violation epitomizes Westbrook energy in second half  #WARRIORSvTHUNDER
Where's the home team call?
There you go
If Durant wasn't ice cold now, this game would be over  #WARRIORSvTHUNDER
Did he call glass??
Does Curry ever stop moving?
Only chance for Thunder is for Durant to go off  #WarriorsVSThunder
@ApplePasta not enough options to score
Unreal how Durant can run the floor at 6'11   #WarriorsVSThunder
So many easy buckets for the @warriors
Congrats to all. What a show  https://t.co/FhX8jP7erZ
Great call https://t.co/2yzXTO7ItI
Luis.....ahhhh Luis....ahhhh...forget it https://t.co/kJFoNI5XEz
