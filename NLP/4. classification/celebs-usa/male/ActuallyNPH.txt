What I want for my birthday, Part Last: for anyone irked by this bit to know I‚Äôm not being serious, I do this every year, and it‚Äôs mainly just to mention things I think are cool. Happy hump day!
Sincere apologies to @Racheldoesstuff for my Tony tweet. I failed to research her before pressing ‚Äòsend‚Äô, and what I thought was a funny comment in our living room must have been far from funny to read, backstage, mid show. As a performer and a parent, I should have know better.
Things I want for my birthday, Part Four: a melodica. It‚Äôs a keyboard that you play by breathing into a tube on the end. Also known as a ‚Äòblow organ‚Äô but, umm, I‚Äôm, err, probably better off calling it a melodica. https://t.co/QCsvciaBOV
What I want for my birthday, Part Three: automatons. Moving mechanical marvels, either vintage or contemporary, like this from the amazing Thomas Kuntz. Awesome.  https://t.co/LxSMcBbzPb
What I want for my birthday, Part Two: a newfound resolve to meditate and focus. To calm my mind and create a space for - oh, oh! - and any new VR games for @OculusRift and/or @htcvive! VR is soooo dope, yo!
What I want for my birthday, Part One: anything designed by @elonmusk, or any intel on what future technologies he‚Äôs creating. Cough, cough, 2 day shipping with @amazonprimenow, cough!
Congrats to the entire @TheTonyAwards production team. It‚Äôs a beast, and you tamed is incredibly well. So many performances, so many awards. Not an easy task. Well played.
@Racheldoesstuff @TheTonyAwards Indeed! Well said. Thanks for the reminder. How was backstage?
@MaryColon @thealexnewell @springsteen Seriously? Miking Actors isn‚Äôt because they can‚Äôt project, it‚Äôs for creating a proper sound mix. Using a teleprompter is just not being willing to memorize your lines. The director should have said something. Oh wait.
@pope_meredith11 @thealexnewell @springsteen Umm, yes he was.
How was @thealexnewell not nominated for a Tony? @springsteen won, and he uses teleprompters. I don‚Äôt get the logic... #livetweetingtheTonys
It‚Äôs hard to watch @TheTonyAwards. I miss it.
Who is the woman in the top hat backstage at @TheTonyAwards? Gideon remarked that she says ‚Äòlike‚Äô and ‚Äòoh my god‚Äô a lot. I‚Äôm confused...
Holy wow, watching @carouselbway makes me love  @TheTonyAwards!
My birthday is less than a week away. Still plenty of time for gifts to arrive. Address in bio. Thanks in advance. I love it/them.
Any suggestions on which video game platform might be best suited for 7 year old boy/girl twins? PlayStation? Nintendo? Intellivision? What‚Äôs better for first graders? Are there new technologies? Games that aren‚Äôt super violent? Oh wow, I sound old... #help

Just saw both parts of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on B‚Äôway (@HPPlayNYC) and...wow. It is to plays what Hamilton is to musicals. Stop what you‚Äôre doing and see this magical show. Poetic, dramatic, respectful, exciting. The cast is sublime. Must. See. #gobsmacked https://t.co/OCgz32fCC3

Enjoyed a delicious steak dinner at @BenjaminSteak after David's show. Dee-licious! A great post theatre option. Very large, very macho.
This night's awesome. Had a stellar dinner at @CatchNY, now heading to NBC shindig to shake many a hand. Can't wait for you to see the show.
At the NBC Upfronts, as they announce their new season, including my variety show: Best Time Ever w/ Neil Patrick Harris. I hope you dig it.
Happy Mother's Day. I am blessed with an absolutely fantastic mom - wonderful person, doting grandma, beautiful soul. I love her lots. üåπ
Just saw @HandtoGodBway. Maybe the craziest shit I've ever seen. In the best possible way. The entire cast deserves a hand. But just one.
Come join the madness: I'm headlining a big variety show at the @Just_For_Laughs Festival in Montreal on 7/27. Tix: http://t.co/8RopsPt4gJ

This I Love: the podcast @Radiolab. It's fantastic. "A show about curiosity", as they put it. Intelligent, creative, witty. Do listen.
I keep finding things to recommend. So, I'm starting a new thing called 'This I Love'. Not paid endorsements, just random stuff I dig.
‚Äú@elsiete: @ActuallyNPH thanks in advance for helping out!‚Äù My plezsh. Hope he gets an A.
‚Äú@elsiete: 1) fav animal? Dolphin 2) what do you miss about ABQ? Green chile 3) what's the 1st magic trick you learned? Nickels to dimes‚Äù :)

Loving London. Soaking in all of the behind the scenes producing of my new variety show, based in Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway.
Congrats @Davidburtka and the entire cast &amp; creative team of @ShouldaBeenYou for a job well done at their first preview last night! #success
Happy St. Patrick's Day!  Look out for leprechauns! http://t.co/wZ0aH31mNx
Just realized it's Friday the 13th! All makes sen-Wait, someone's at the door. I'll let him in. Hmm. He has a hockey mask and a machet-OHNO!
I picked up a face down penny, stepped on cracks in the pavement, a dog started howling and a bird flew in my window. Today be crazy! Hmm...
Blurg! There's a water leak in the living room! Oh wait, here's an umbrella. I'll just open it up and use it to protect the couch. Hmm...
Ug! I'm trying to eat lunch and this darned salt shaker keeps dropping onto the floor! There's salt everywhere!  Hmmm...
Following the kitty. Under a ladder? Okay crazy cat, if you insist! Hey, look there's a mirror. Hope it doesn't fa- oh, it shattered! Hmm...
Happy 13th, everyone! What a lovely Friday. Oh look, a cute little black kitten just walked right in front of me. Hmm. What could that mean?
Spectacular night with the kids. Karate class, dinner with Daddy, sneaking in to see him sing and dance at his @ShouldaBeenYou rehearsal. :)
I'm loving this downtime with the kids - taking them to school, preparing meals, reading books. Lots of work but so worth it. #grateful
Just saw The Audience on B'way. All hail Helen Mirren! Phenomenal! Reignited my love for the theatre. #masterclass #bravo

So first I saw the dress as white and gold, and only that. Now, it's absolutely blue and black. How?!? Does this make me bi-dress-ual?

My iphone shattered the morning of the Oscars. I probably should have read more into that. #harbinger
It's the day of the show, y'all. #Oscars @TheAcademy
Hey, I know that dude! @TheAcademy http://t.co/f3t9ooOMhM
I'm super appreciative for the group of writers we hired for my #Oscars content. If only they could write everything I say always. #proud
My brain hurts from all the #Oscars overthinking. It's time for the fine tuning, rewording, and 3rd guessing. So much minutiae! @TheAcademy
No turning back: Dropped off my official #Oscars predictions to the two people in charge of the ballots at @pwc_llp. http://t.co/WXawVsDcbu
Congrats, SNL - 40 years of classic, cool, courageous current comedy. Well played. @nbcsnl
Question: what you're favorite movie that wasn't - and shouldn't have been - nominated for an #oscar? My choice: The movie Clue.
So fortunate to see You Can't Take It With You today on B'way. Closes 2/22. Wish it could play forever! Absolutely loved it! @CantTakeItBway
‚Äú@Obliviouswb: @ActuallyNPH From EW- CLUE?!  I LOVE that movie!  The cast, the quips, and multiple endings!‚Äù Right?!? Best. Movie. Ever.
‚Äú@Davidburtka: I‚Äôll think about it okay yes!‚Äù Yes! If my Valentine's night was now up for an Oscar, it'd be for Best Original Score!
Hey @Davidburtka - Will you be my Valentine? Ok, I realize you're already my husband, but a 'yes' would sure make my day/night/life.
Congrats to the North Carolina Powerball winner! Way to make winning an #Oscar seem that much less impressive. @TheAcademy
Rehearsals are intense for the Oscars.  And by rehearsals, I mean me singing into a hairbrush in front of a mirror.  #Oscars2015 @TheAcademy
Had a tremendous meal last night at @MVinkLA. Massively impressed by food is both exquisite to look at and delicious. http://t.co/YS1IckPucT
Tonight, I'll be joining the hilarious @PaulGreenberg1 in the season finale of @IGIHollywood at 8:30e/p only on @AudienceDIRECTV #haunted
Looking over the preparations for the #Oscars set. After last night, we've installed a second layer of Kanye-proofing, just in case.
As always, unbelievable respect for the crew working backstage at the Grammys. Changing out set after set - their work is amazing.
GAH! Our best of friends just had a child! Sorry Grammys, but the godfathers have to meet themselves a new baby! #goodnight
Hmmm. Jamie Foxx reading braille next to Stevie Wonder. Not sure how to feel about that.
Amazing. Beck and Chris Martin sure did... stand there super well. So much energy!
Sam Smith is awesome.
Who knew Kristen Wiig was such an amazing dancer! Wait. I think someone put something in my drink. This ain't right. #whatishappening
Shia Lebouf sure knows how to read a teleprompter.
Prince is so shiny..!
Sam Smith is awesome. Add Mary J. Blige- just wow.
"This would be a real good tiiiiime.. to take a nap."
Just loving the Grammys. Thanks to CBS and Jack Sussman for creating such an amazing show, year in and year out. If you get a chance, GO!
Usher can sing. But did that harpist come from the Ariana Grande school of hair design?
It's Ga Ga Game time! http://t.co/z8cYAQOT95
Wow. That was awesome. @katyperry as Princess Leia has never sounded better.
Pharrell just can't stop wearing shorts..! Is this a Wes Anderson movie? Does he work at the Grammy Budapest Hotel?
So @Davidburtka and I have agreed that if Nick Jonas responds to this tweet, our wedding vows will sort of kind of change a bit.
Annie Lennox is awesome. Not only can she sing, but her bird calls worked! They are everywhere! #don'tcare #standingovation
Annie Lenox makes everything better. Especially church.
Adam Levine must be some sort of super hero person. Doesn't he want to have my baby?
Gwen Stafani must be some sort of super hero person. Didn't she just have a baby??
I thought Beyonc√© had a middle part, not a beehive. #goodtoknow
Josh Duhamel is everything.
Madonna is losing the Running of the Bulls. Oh wait, here comes a gospel choir. She's good. Oh, no. She's dead. She lost.
Sam Smith is awesome.
Who knew Miranda Lambert's set designer was her biggest fan? She's hot, but cool.
Pharrell is actively disrespecting everyone on the frozen East Coast by wearing shorts in the winter. #howdareyousir
Marion Cotillard is up for an Oscar AND singing on the Grammys with Tom Jones? What can't she do?!?
Ariana Grande's eyelids seem really heavy.
Anna Kendrick looks hot. No bra. Well played.
I'm one envelope away from seeing Taylor Swift's lady parts.
LL Cool J is talking. All I can hear is ringing in my ears. I think they're bleeding. #oldpersonjoke
AC-DC opened then show, and now everyone is effectively deafened. And I think six people had seizures. And 50+ got 3rd degree burns.
I gotsta live tweet the Grammys! Get ready: as a non-winner, I'm eleven drinks in.
Aw, nerts..! We didn't win a Grammy for @HedwigOnBway. Kudos to Beautiful, but @stephentrask's music still rules my rock-ish world.
Thinking of going with a solid gold tuxedo for Oscar night. Thoughts? #chafing @TheAcademy
In honor of Birdman, we‚Äôre going to do the whole #Oscars broadcast in one continuous shot.

Due to the Patriots ball scandal, I‚Äôll personally be making sure all the Oscars are fully inflated this year. #Oscars
This year's #Oscars will be a little different: In addition to acceptance speeches, all non-winners must deliver concession speeches.
Today we honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a remarkable humanitarian and civil rights leader. #greatness #respect

Maybe everyone should ask @OzBoateng to dress me for @TheTonyAwards. That seems to be the consensus.
I Iove this British designer Ozwald Boateng, but D&amp;G is great. Paul Smith, too. I'm getting nervous for show time.
‚Äú@GarrettGrantham: @ActuallyNPH hey Neil, you wanna hang out in northern virginia?‚Äù Umm... based on your pic, probably not.
What tux should I wear for @TheTonyAwards? I need to pick a great designer... Suggestions?

So as my 3,000,000th follower never responded, the Ducky Tie now goes to #3,000,001! Congrats, @ForceFieldJer. DM me for deets.
Very happy to hear the documentary @BullyMovie was given a PG-13 rating by the MPAA. It's a powerful film that should be seen by all.
I adore Amy Sedaris. Just watched her as the Tooth Fairy on Yo Gabba Gabba. She's maybe the coolest chick around. That's all.
@LeahthePage right now I'd say Hedwig. It seems camp and simple, but is really dark and complicated, raw and sexy. A real actor's part.
All in all, a lovely meal. Very french and fancy. Extra expensive, though. Good for a special occasion..?
Dessert: My dapper dining companion, @Davidburtka. Sweeter than the tastiest confection. http://t.co/k5e8Ev3S

So @Davidburtka and I had our anniversary meal at M√©lisse in Santa Monica. Here's what we ate. Let the food porn commence! (trumpet sounds)
OK, the # I chose last week was: 1,347,850 (# of sexual partners). The winner, 2 away with 1,347,852 is @philiphodgetts. DM me for dinner!
Tomorrow I reveal the (rannndom!) winner of the 3M contest. And continue my food porn with our anniversary dinner. 'Night.
Here's some cool news: http://t.co/Ksm5X86O
Dinner at Melisse in Santa Monica. Delicious. I'm so full I may burst. Will provide a full pictorial report tomorrow.
Today @Davidburtka and I are celebrating our 8th anniversary (a day early). There will be champagne, gifts, sex, and most likely food porn.
Here's how I assured accuracy: http://t.co/mQz2grhR
Still tabulating. But the 3 millionth follower is @sarahbeep. Random congratulations! DM me and I'll send you something random (ducky tie?)
Having a rough time sifting through all of these guesses. Twitter won't let me access all of the responses! Stay tuned...
Times up! No more guesses allowed. Give me a night to look through the responses and figure out the winner. Yay, this is fun!
The prize will be dinner with me and @Davidburtka at the @MagicCastle. If you're not local, I'll send you something equally awesome.
In honor of @DerrenBrown: I'm thinking of a # between 1 and 3,000,000. Closest guess wins. I'll stop taking guesses in 3 hours. Good luck.
So for reaching 3M followers, I'm gonna have a contest. Right now. Winner will get a wicked great prize. Ready?
3 million.  Egads!  As promised, I'll give a cool gift to someone, and explain my plan tomorrow.
Very proud of @DavidBurtka. He did a very powerful interview with Sir Elton John about bullying. It's airing on @ENews tonight.
‚Äú@Ojoya: I've never understood giving a future follower a prize. Why not give a random follower something when you hit 3MIL?" Good point...
I wanna give my 3 millionth (!) follower something cool. How would one quantify that? Is there some sort of log?
This week at work is our last show of the season. 24 episodes! Time flies when you're suiting up, drinking, and shagging actors. Having fun.

So Becki Newton, my sexy new HIMYM squeeze is on Twitter, but her handle is @NewtonBecki and not what I tweeted before.
Tonight watch the radiant @beckinewton in her first of many episodes of HIMYM. She plays a chick I'm trying to bang.
Great Grammys! Bravo to the entire gang that produces this show. Seriously, from backstage it's unreal. Crew, handlers, producers: bravo!
Adele!!  I kissed her. On both cheeks. Just sayin'.
Nicki Minaj was outstanding. Levitations rule.
Adele is back.  Dope.
Just hung out with Fergie. Not only is she hot and talented and super cool, but she's a 2 time Grammy winner tonight.  8 so far. Respect.
Katy Perry doing a magic illusion on the Grammys just gave me a boner. Is that wrong?
Taylor Swift! And Sheriff Swift! And Coal Miner Swift! And Prospector Swift!
Handing out electronically monitored bracelets for the Coldplay song has made many people around me  nervous. #notnamingnames

Just watched the Super Bowl Halftime Show on TV. I think it's one of the best produced shows ever. Big ups to all that worked so hard on it.
Tonight's HIMYM episode was crazy to film. Just know: all three acts are exactly the same length. It'll make sense after you see it.
At last: a brand new episode of HIMYM is on tonight! It's a 'structure' episode, one of my favorite kinds. Hopey you likey.
I really dug the halftime show. Not sure how it looked on TV, but all the production and projections combined with Madonna rocking? Loved.
Oh, and I finally ate at @stelmo! So happy I couldn't stop crying. Partly because we got a table, mostly from the spicy shrimp cocktail.
What a day at the Super Bowl! All I wanted was a close, exciting game right up to the last play. It didn't disappoint. Congrats, NY Giants!
Kidding aside, we had dinner at @recessindy and it was fantastic. Great concept, lovely staff, and spot on food. Yum! http://t.co/6gmpncjR
Well, the Steak and Shake didn't have our reservation and couldn't take us until 10:45. So we're still searching for dinner.
Saw @billyeichner on the street with a camera crew. I wanted to jump out of the car a play a game with him. Love that guy.
Got a reservation at a fancy place I found online. Famous for their beef and sweet drinks. Called Steak and... Shake? Hope it's good.
Just tried to get into St. Elmo (@stelmo) for dinner. Booked solid until 10:30!  What is this, the night before the Super Bowl? #boo
Last night was wild in Indy. I wanted to go explore, but there were 17 bazillion people in the streets. It was like Super Bowl-i Gras.
Very excited for a Super Bowl weekend in Indianapolis. Where should I go? I hear there's a big football game on Sunday.
Comics Fans: my friend and fellow magi @cardjon (with @mikecosta) put a cool idea to paper. Check it out at @SmokeMirrorsIDW

Congrats to Daniel Radcliffe on his final performance of How to Succeed on B'way. 8 shows a week for 10 months demands respect. Kudos.

Watching the Ed Alonzo's Psycho Circus at Knott's. Best show in the park. Screw mazes, check out his hilarity! Love Ed Alonzo!
Loved the Hanging at Knott's! Well done, stunt actors. Well done, writer Jeff Tucker! Hilarious.
At Knott's Scary Farm! Such an awesome, scary night. My best friend Ed Alonzo is starring in a show. Must see! Be afraid, be very afraid!
Happy International Suit Up Day! Pimp your threads with pride, and send me pics as I want proof of your awesomeness.
And I'm in awe of, and so grateful for, @davidburtka. He is, in my humble opinion, the greatest dad in the history of ever.
Things I dig: our twins Gideon and Harper, who are one year old today! They are glorious. So proud to be their Papa.
Had a freakishly good time acting with @hitRECordJoe tonight at his #FallFormal. Literally 75 camera phones surrounding us. Surreal!
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.  Your genius will live on for generations to come...
RT @therealjackc @ActuallyNPH PLEASE WATCH THIS. IT'S DEDICATED TO YOU. http://t.co/jTehRBy6 Y'allz dope! Well played. Made my morning.
My smurfy friend Hank Azaria is starring in Free Agents, a new comedy tonight at 8:30. Yes, it's on NBC, but he's too funny not to watch.
Things I dig: You Don't Know Jack! Awesome trivia-ish game show, now on your iPhone! Welcome back, old friend. http://t.co/MwL1lVSv
I can't get over it. Best concert I've ever been to. And I'm not a shill. Just a fan. Wow.
Elton's show was f***ing unreal! He's fanfriggingtastic. If you go to Vegas... See. This. Show.
Midshow. I'm so lucky to have somehow been on Elton John's radar.  His show is fantastic. He's better than he's ever been!  Great night.
Just arrived in Vegas, baby! So excited to go to Caesar's Palace and see Elton John's opening. I hope that's not a euphemism.
@atigs  Break legs, Andy. Specifically, Captain Hammer's. I'm sure you'll knock 'em dead. And the 'em is, one again, Captain Hammer.
Things I dig: Sonos wireless music system. Listen to different music in every room of the house! A perfect gift for, say, Rosh Hashanah.
Just saw the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's new show IRIS. It's ammazing! If you come to Hollywood, it is a MUST SEE!  Best show in years!
Jim Henson would have been 75 today.  I wish he were still around.  I miss him.
Equinox gyms turn 20 today. I must say, they don't look it. #Happy20thEquinox

How I Met Your Mother premieres TONIGHT! Tell your friends, alert your neighbors, cold call random people. It's a good one. I even dance.

Things I dig: @HowardStern. Weather a live show or a Best Of, King Stern and the Gang make driving in L.A. a blast. Huge fan. Baba Booey!
Things I dig: state fairs. Just went to the NM one. Petting zoos, lemonade, carnies and deep fried peanut butter cups: http://img.ly/8owx
Looking for an affordable, reliable, awesome handyman to help with a big family project in ABQ, NM. Anyone interested?
And fireworks! Wowza! http://img.ly/8f8n
At the Hollywood Bowl, listening to Tchaikovsky by the glorious LA Philharmonic. Sometimes it's nice to just still and listen for a spell.
Uch. Watching Big Brother is now a waste of time...
Things I dig: Monkeys.
Things I Dig: Equinox gyms. Not cheap, but worth it. Best staff, hottest members, latest equipment. They make sweating sweet.
Things I dig: Sushi. Sitting at the bar being served amazing fish, Omakase-style, is the best. Kiwami in Studio City is my current #1.
Things I dig: Les Miserables. Say what you might, but I just caught the London O2 concert on PBS, and that show is all kinds of epic.
RT @whasabae @ActuallyNPH have you been watching #cbsbigbrother this season? If so, your thoughts on it...) Jordan, all the way. I love her.
Things I dig: Pottery Barn Kids. Just got me a changing table and a rug and such. The twins can't stay away: http://img.ly/7ZVg
Things I dig: Ventriloquist puppets. Old school vaudeville and creepy. Here's one I own: http://img.ly/7ZlD
I think I'm gonna start tweeting about things I dig.  Not 'shallow graves' or 'tunnels to China', more just random stuff that I like.
Book seats to live local events thru @Goldstar. They just sold their 5 millionth ticket! Read the @techcrunch write up: http://t.co/sHMKeL0
Oops. Steve Jobs and Tim Cook apparently have different twitter names. Sorry, other dudes that I just wrote about.
Crazy respect for @SteveJobs. The technology that he championed? Phenomenal.  Best of luck, @timcook. Long live Apple.
My god. What have I done? I inadvertently watched the new show Dance Moms. It's repulsive. And yet hypnotic. I hate that I love it. Help me.
Sorry I haven't tweeted lately. I fear I've run out of things to say. Like we're on an awkward 4th date, staring at each other in silence.
Back at work on HIMYM's season 7! I must say, the premiere episode will definitely be groovy.
Terrific. Now, instead of blocks, all the twins are wanting for their birthday is a mega-yacht.
The family and I are having one of the best weeks of our lives. More details to come. Oh, and go see Smurfs. Xoxo
Had a lot of fun with @BravoAndy last night. Here's a picture of me pointing at him: http://img.ly/6FWN
RT @BravoAndy There's nothing @ActuallyNPH can't do!! What a great guest. Thanks Neil http://say.ly/MPNwSJ  My pleasure. Anytime.
@HowardStern, where was Eric on the red carpet for the Smurfs premiere?!? I was dying to talk to him!
Had a blast on The Daily Show. Jon Stewart may be the sharpest interviewer around. Synapses firing fast to keep up with him. Hope u dig.
RT @KellyRipa Hey @ActuallyNPH check it out! Smurftastic!! http://lockerz.com/s/123620034  Thanks, KR. Already miss you.
Smurfs premiere this afternoon in NYC! Hmmm, what color should I wear..?
Had a blast guest judging SYTYCD this week! The top 10 dancers are so talented - almost better than those chicks that danced with Snoop.
I hate AT&T and their errant cellphone reception with a burning, white-hot fury. Calls drop 15-20 times a day. Is Verizon way better?
What a rush! I must say, I feel so proud of all of the dancers. From dress rehearsal through live broadcast, they gave their all. Well done.
Just finished dress rehearsal for SYTYCD. Such pressure. I'm really REALLY nervous right now. And I'm only sitting in a chair!
I love having the 405 freeway closed. Traffic is nonexistent. Carmageddon is the best! I'm gonna Carma-get-in my car and run some errands.
If you didn't see The Best and the Brightest film, it's soon on Netflix. It's highbrow & lowbrow, with Amy Sedaris! http://t.co/UneQkgS
Gideon & Harper are 9 months old today. Having a low key party. 400 people. Viper room. Slam dancing. Pitbull is performing. Should be dope.
Had a wonderful afternoon with the great @stephenfry today.  It involved cameras and took place in my living room, and for once wasn't porn.
Happy 5th of July! For those of you that already miss fireworks, here's a fun, sexy video I found:  http://t.co/ipI73QM
Happy 4th of July, everyone!  Hope the fireworks were/are awesome tonight.  Both literally and metaphorically.
My mother's father, G. Walter Scott, passed away this afternoon. He was 95, and was a great influence on me. Rest in peace, Grandpa Scott.
So I'm directing a cool theatre show, Expert at the Card Table, 7/13 to 8/7. Limited seating. Watch me pimp it: http://t.co/evqXwCX
@RichardBlais @FlipBurger Likewise, RB. You're an inspiration. Let's open a Flip Burger in L.A.!
Kripsy Kreme milkshake at Flip Burger (yes, it's topped with liquid nitrogen): http://img.ly/5GHJ
Just left Atlanta after a few days of fun. Amazing restaurants! Flip Burger was unreal. Woodfire Grill tasting: spectacular! Top Chefs rock.
My three go to's: pasta bolognese, a burrito, or some delightful version of a chicken sandwich.
I wish every meal could be a tasting menu, chosen by the chef and served as a surprise. Otherwise, I always order the same three things.
Dear media: Just because David and I will soon be able to marry in NY, doesn't mean we are actively planning a wedding. Cart before horse.
And now, for something far less political: A rock juggling otter!  http://t.co/QFFkPjr
Weird that Drudge Report has not a single mention about the marriage equality vote in NY? Does he not want to admit that it happened?
David and I did propose to each other, but over five years ago! We've been wearing engagement rings for ages, waiting for an available date.
It PASSED!  Marriage equality in NY!! Yes!! Progress!! Thank you everyone who worked so hard on this!! A historic night!
I'd sure love to get married. Please, NY Senate, vote in favor of marriage equality today. My family would really appreciate it.
@Shadowolf19 Try booking thru @Goldstar. They are amazing. I strongly endorse them. See live events at a major discount: http://t.co/vc5aYer

Wow. I just hosted an event for LGBT rights, and the keynote speaker was President Obama himself! He's amazing. Called me 'openly terrific'!
May be seeing Sleep No More again tonight. But as everyone wears masks throughout the show, you'll never knoooooow..!
The answer was 'SCOTT' or 72688. The numbers represented the letters on a telephone pad. To everyone who solved it, well played...
Speaking of codes, solve this:  9428 47 843 643353 6263 63 69 766?   Hope you don't get hung up on this one...
Why, when ordering said @GogoInflight, does it taunt me with entering a promotional code? What is this secret code and why don't I know it?
Flying East.  Loving LOVING the wifi on the plane!  Thank you Gogo Inflight.  You keep me away from Skymall and it's wondrous treasures.
COMPANY will extend its run from June 23rd to June 26th at many movie theaters across the country! Visit www.CompanyOnScreen.com for deets.
@ball4NY Please vote yes on marriage equality. It'd mean a lot to me and my family.
Are the twins's unique fussing, crying, and crabbiness today supposed to be some sort of karmic Father's Day lesson?
Then, in the backyard, he hired a group of acrobats to do this epic Cirque-like show in/around the pool. With fire!! @Davidburtka rules.
My b'day was unreal. D created a surprise 'murder mystery' with 25 close friends in character. I was the detective and had to solve crimes!
Company is starting is limited run in theatres today! 1 show per night.  Only 4 nights. Buy a ticket for my birthday! http://t.co/0PfrGLs
I'm old right now...
After many many months, Spider-Man opens on B'way tonight. To the great cast and crew who knew not what they were in for: congratulations!
Kudos also to David Javerbaum and Adam Schlesinger for writing the Tony Opening Number and for having difficult names to spell.
Better link: youtu.be/4CR-sAit8LE
Kudos to @Lin_Manuel and Thomas Kail for penning my closing Tony 'rap-up'. Watch 'em create the song during the show: t.co/XZQrDPZ
Walking the High Line for the first time. About to see the sun set. The vibe here is great, everyone is so happy. New York is fantastic!
Spending way to many hours at Mario Batali's amaaaazing Italian market/restaurant/food mall Eataly. David is in culinary heaven!
Having a perfect relaxing day with D. Just saw the Alexander McQueen exhibit at the Met. Intricate, sexy, hypnotic and inspiring.
Thanks everyone for such nice Tony tweets. I had an absolute blast. Can't believe after all that work, it's over! Congrats to all of B'way!
In prepping for the Tonys, I find that I only have 2 1/2 hours of Spiderman material, and need much more. So. Favorite Spiderman joke. Go:
Normal Heart: Joe Mantello gives the most riveting, honest, passionate, brilliant performance I've seen in years. I am so deeply impressed.
Saw The Normal Heart tonight. Riveting. I'm a mess. All gay people should be required to see it. All straight people will be changed by it.
Saw Anything Goes tonight. Really great. Sutton Foster is never not amazing. She's like a perfect robot person.
Jane Lynch is hosting this year's Emmys. Great call. Perfect choice. Can't wait.
I must say, New York theatre is so impressive this year! Tonight I saw Motherfu**er With The Hat. I fucking loved it.
The love of my life and daddy to our twins - @DavidBurtka - was born today. I am very glad he was. Would you send him a B'day message?
I still can't stop thinking about the show last night. Moody, sexy, edgy. It's like existing in a David Lynch movie. www.sleepnomoreNYC.com
@tykapfh Is there ever a show you DON'T like?! // Oh yeah. I'm just very specific in my wording. Compliments don't always equal raves.
Saw Sleep No More tonight. 1 of the single greatest things I've EVER seen. Immersive theatre on a whole other level: www.sleepnomoreNYC.com
NYC-ers: My friend Nick has a hilarious show he co-writes called Shells, and it's at Joe's Pub tonight. Critic's pick: http://t.co/0nOs6PG
Saw the play Good People at MTC tonight. It's so impressive to watch such adept actors live on stage. And to think they do it 8x a week!
What number can Book of Mormon even DO on @thetonyawards?!?
Book of Mormon tonight. Hardest I've laughed during a show in years. A F***ing Plus. Everyone is brilliant. Must must see.
More theatah: saw matinee of Catch Me If You Can. Norbert Leo Butz is outstanding. Aaron Tveit (again, robbed!) is SO crazy gifted.
Crows=crowds. Stupid thumbs...
The Tony preparations continue. Saw How To Succeed last night. Daniel was robbed. Rob Ashford's direction rules. The crows went nuts.
Just saw Sister Act on B'way. No expectations - and we loved it. Patina Miller (the lead) has every reason to win a Tony.
I'm trying to find a really great ventriloquist puppet, with lots of clever articulation. And oddly, there is no punchline. Any leads?
HIMYM Season 6 Finale is TONIGHT! You should watch, as one character will DIE! Not really, but it's a funny show: http://bit.ly/kaiLgV
Just saw Priscilla, Queen of the Desert on Broadway. Gayest thing I've ever seen, in the good way. Audience loved it, as did I.
@gottaloveyou1 The other day I announced that I would have a sex change just so I could have a chance with @ActuallyNPH. --- That's hot.
A great, great documentary about a junior magician competition is playing for one week in NY: http://tinyurl.com/3hlmgdu  If you can, GO!
Ashton's replacing Charlie?  Good times! CBS shindigs just got much easier on the eyes...
@Georgaldinho: I think I've turned gay for you.  ---  That's hot.
My friend and great magician Derek (@derek_del) is performing a magic show live, via Twitter, on 5/19. Whuua? http://tinyurl.com/3f3sx9c
And, just like that, we found her some housing!  Thanks for the help, all.  As per yoojh, my Twitter team rules.
NYers: I'm trying to find a simple, furnished sublet for our nanny in the Upper West Side-ish area for a month or so.  Any leads?
The Tony Awards are now on Twitter: (timpani...) @thetonyawards  (and spin it, and spot it, and spin it, and spin it, and splits!)
I'm hosting this year's Tony Awards.  (crouch, snap! - step, snap! - step, snap! - jazz hands!)
Just came upon this cool site.  It's basically a trailer, but looks spooky and involves puppets, so I must share:  www.thespiritcabinet.com
Happy Mother's Day, everyone!  I'm very lucky to have a mom I respect and love. Sheila (@gladsheila), I'm super proud to be your son.
Oof.  Just ate a giant, nasty beef burrito for dinner. Happy Cinco de Mayoh, no..!
Oops. Mormon, not Morman. (insert your own joke here: ____________ )
Tony nominations today. Book of Morman nabbed the most. Wonder which number they will be allowed do on the show? Censors must be nervous!
Navy Seals are the s#it.
Everyone is sitting around my living room, mouths agape. Wow, what a night. Thank you, Mr. President, for such an eloquent speech.
Going to a friend's to watch the UFC fights tonight.  I need to learn how to discipline the babies once they become toddlers.
Sorry I haven't tweeted lately. The monkeys are teething, and drool is everywhere. As it turns out, the iPhone is not a great pacifier.
@NathanFillion Thanks, err. Um. I've.. gotta... err.  I'm now feeling a little... naus... umm... I should sit down, now, Nathan. Um, thanks.
I'm directing my first multi camera pilot for CBS in a few short hours. Hoping the comedy stars align, and all goes swell. Fingers crossed!

Relaxing on a Sunday afternoon.  My heart is full of love: http://yfrog.com/h34btibj
Unsolicited rave: I love Equinox and their gyms. Super clean, new equipment, great employees. Makes me look forward to working out...
Good news: I just received my Shorty Award in the mail.  Less good news: It arrived broken and a bit shattered.  #likemyspirit
Watched the first part of AMC's new series The Killing. I'm hooked. Loving it. Hoping the murder mystery makes a big comeback.
Just saw this: http://tinyurl.com/6fnw2em  Total bunk, absolute nonsense. Annoying. Thanks for needlessly worrying David. 'Preciate that.
@rhydlover We are super duper happy. David is my hero.
Gadzooks, was that Company experience grueling! And just like that, it's done. Crazy. If you saw it, great. If not, I hear you might soon...
@MeritThorson @JeremySmolik Congrats, you two.
This Company gig is kicking my arse. Soo proud of all involved. But I forgot how exhausting it is!  Two shows tomorrow... send good vibes.
Company rehearsals are exhausting madness. Colbert is kigass:  http://yfrog.com/h731476576j

My friend @marycmcCormack is back on In Plain Sight. The new season starts soon, so set your DVRs. She's great and it films in ABQ (bonus!).
... april fools ...  My followers rock.
I'm sick of these negative responses! Rude, hurtful, constant - it's too much. I'm leaving Twitter. Love to say I'm joking, but I'm not.
Oooh, I gotta good tweet. Here goes: 'Aw snap, those Kardashians is so craaazy! WTF?!?'  Good, right?
So I won a Shorty Award for tweeting. Very cool. But now there's too much pressure. I don't know what to say. I have Tweeter's Block...
Muu haa haa!  Muu HA haaa haaaaaa!    First the book, then... the WORLD!!    http://twe.ly/Jfhb
Just performed at a benefit in Ojai, CA. At the dinner after sat next to friggin' @ConanOBrien and his lovely wife! He's very rad. #teamCoco
Harry Houdini was born on this day, 137 years ago.  When using handcuffs or other restraints tonight, please do so in his honor.
@mikenitty91 Mike, I appreciate your saying that.  Thanks, man.  That was a cool thing to acknowledge.  Props to you.
Big new HIMYM on tonight. Barney finally meets his pop. I'm really proud of the way it turned out. If you're able, please watch.
Ok, no more answering of questions for a spell. Knuckleheads keep sending the same ones to me hundreds of times...
@Heterosexismdoc Sorry mate. My dance card is fill right now.
@packman1984 Hey what kind of phone do u have?....Patrick williams from Indianapolis // Iphone (rocks). 3G (rocks). AT&T (not so much).

In honor of my friend @MrTeller (of Penn &) and his good taste in theatre, I'm gonna tweet a riddle soon that rewards those who solve it...
@ampnga There will be another H&K. A holiday flick - in 3D, no less!  And come on, a shotgun blast can't keep a drug-addled NPH down...
@petesawesome My advice? Bad relationships provide knowledge you'll need for the good one. NPH from H&K? Bang some strange. Our babies rock.
I've decided to start replying to more tweets. So every time i check Twitter, I'm gonna respond to the latest one. We'll see how it goes...
Congrats to Josh Radnor for writing/directing/producing/starring in the new film Happythankyoumoreplease. Homey is talented. In LA/NY now.
Thanks for seeing @BeastlyMovie, those that did. Now if each of you tell 287 of your friends to do the same we can beat Rango! Let's do it!
HIMYM picked up for 2 more years! Yahoo! With so much job security, I should buy something extravagant. Like a pony. Or some gold teeth!
John Boehner: no disrespect, but please don't claim to speak for all Americans and what they want their leaders to focus on. You don't.
Charlie Sheen's done lost his crackers...  #teamcbs
Happy Oscar Sunday!  I'm grateful that I'll be watching from my living room this year, and not hyperventilating offstage, about to perform.
Just bought a new (and expennsive!) baby monitor system from Summer Infant. Staring at the many screens makes me feel like a Bond villain...
Gearing up to do lotsta of press for @BeastlyMovie this week. You name it: bench, permanent, full court, im.  Get ready.
Great time at the Grammy!  Now before we go home to tuck in the babies we get wasted in Arcade Fire's tour bus. 'Night, night!
Arcade Fire!  I'm having... a... seizure..!
Nicki Minaj's hair made me hungry for carnival snacks.
I must say, watching the crew backstage strike and set up 18 different acts is amazing. Truly. They deserve an award themselves.
Mick Jagger can work a staaaage!  But listening to the song, I'm not quite sure who exactly he needs...
I'm backstage. I've already declared Cee Lo's my favorite performance. You'll see why shortly.
Holy cripes..!  NINJAS!!
Big fan of the monocle. So glad to see it making a comeback.
MUSE: Masterful Use of Screens. Excellent.
Loved Lady Gaga's ode to Haunted Mansion's pipe organ.  Respect.
Alright, it's decided. I'm going with the wrestling singlet and the glitter. Can't wait!!
Excited for my 1st Grammys! What should I wear? I'm thinking a black tux with that metal robot headpiece will.i.am wore at the Super Bowl.
Just finished a long, exhilarating day filming with @john_lithgow. So talented. Such a wonderful vibe. Very lucky to have him on the show.

@PerezHilton: Agreed. Most Mimis have been much older. But there's something tragic and vulnerable and raw about a very young addict...
@PerezHilton: Zoe is great, but Mimi is 19.  I think casting someone age specific, especially at the Hollywood Bowl, will have added impact.
@PerezHilton: Mimi's not a hooker. Addict, yes. You're saying, because of her past roles, Vanessa can't play that? I respectfully disagree.

So I'm directing the Hollywood Bowl's staged concert version of RENT.  Random Question #72: who would be ideal to cast and for what role?
Bobsleds are cool.  They look so modern.  I wonder what's inside of them?  Cup holders?  Ipod docks?  Mood lighting?  Flat screen TVs?
Olympic curling - riveting!  But what's with all the shouting at each other?  They sound like lion tamers in the circus:  Hup. HUP! HUUUUP!
Agenda-free plug: as far as gymnasium organizations go, Equinox is fantastic. They are classy, state-of-the-art, and everywhere. My 2 cents.
I friggin' love the Olympics. I never thought I could care so much for people or sports that I just learned about six minutes beforehand.
Oh, and Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!  I hope you spent some time being open to love, being expressive in your feelings, and cuddling.

Jennifer Lopez was really great - hot, cool, and funny.  And well prepared! She gave me a few pointers. Here's one: http://yfrog.com/33kruhj
Follow Friday Pick: The Dan Band. One of the most hilarious, best concerts ever. Google 'em. Better yet, follow 'em: @thedanband  Eff yeah.
The ever-hilarious Craig Ferguson has joined Twitter. @craigyferg  Please make him feel welcome, or I fear he'll start drinking again...
Ok, major gossip on J.Lo, y'all! We were hanging out on set today, between takes. She turns to me and says, dig this: "Neil, I'm going to tr
J LO's on HIMYM, not Glee.  At least not yet.  Future Ted Mosby got to her first!  How bout that?  Bang!
I get to work with Jennifer Lopez on Friday.  J. Lo.  I get to work with her.  Yep.  I'm gonna get my work on with her.  NPH and J, um, LO.
To all my Twitter pals that came to the Cube taping, that stayed all the way to the end: I thank you for sticking around, and for being rad.
I must say that @derrenbrown could have the greatest apartment I have ever seen in all my days. I'm in awe. And he's super cool, to boot.
Stunning immersive theatre last night: Shunt's Money: http://www.piurl.com/22,c  Simon Kane staggering. Direction awesome. Find a way to go!

Random question #681: What was your favorite game show growing up?  What's your favorite game show now?  Me: Match Game and Survivor
I'm never leaving HIMYM. That job rocks. This would just have me doing double duty on the Tiffany Network. (Huh, huh. I said double duty...)
London is dreary and drizzly and perfect.  I'm here filming a pilot for a new show.  It tapes Thursday.  Send good vibes?  Thanks.  Cheerio!
Apparently the Kelly Ripa that demands you to submit to be her friend is a fraud.  I'm glad, because the real Ripa is dope and would never!
Everyone follow Jesse Tyler Ferguson (@jessetyler) and Kelly Ripa (@regis_and_kelly) so they will stop talking smack. BTW, London is grand.
Just heard that the Pasadena Playhouse is closing in early Feb: http://tiny.cc/2KKJx  Such a bummer. A great institution will be missed...
That being said, I have a new favorite word and obsession:  iPad  (drool...)
As much as I LOVE me my iPhone, it's unbelivadiculous how crazy often my calls get dropped. Curse you, AT&T and your exclusivity!!

@neilpatrickbenn Love, boss Benn.
Oh, and Labyrinth 2!  How could I forget THAT!?!  Love me some Labyrinth 2.  I'm stumped on some.  I'm not afraid to say it - I'm stumped..!
And NPR.  Damn it, the right answer is NPR.  Shoulda said that.  It's great.  You should pledge.  Love NPR.  It's on my homepage.  Carry on.
Nice.  For me: Loved Tiki Towers. Until I didn't. Then Rope 'N Fly. Now Peggle!  Productivity: Ghost Cam annnd... Indiana Jones Sound Board?
OK, funish question: what are your two favorite iPhone apps? 1 game and 1 productive type.  Or 2 games.  But the BESTEST!      Ready..?  Go:
Strange. Feels like this is turning adversarial. Know that I'm a fan of JB and if he wins this poll, I'll happily stand right behind him...
@ThatKevinSmith Didn't realize the upset my words caused.  Looked back at what you said, and I concur.  Ignorance on my part.  Apologies.
Yowza! Just got home. Who knew Barrowman liked to play so rough? I need one final NPH push! (That sounded naughty...) http://tiny.cc/IhRGJ
If you're feeling it, throw a vote my way:   http://tiny.cc/Do80i   Being atop John Barrowman would be a great way to start the decade...
@jzashu I've been in a remote town near Cancun, spotty wifi. Went to the largest, oddest water park there called Xcaret. Cool, yet loco!

Holiday Airline Madness! Flight to NY cancelled, mad dash to find seats in full planes. Feel like I'm on the Amazing Race. In the bad way.
Sushi post script: Kiwami Sushi rocked my brain hole. Thanks for all the suggestions.  I'm lucky to live near such amazing fresh fish.
Best sushi in Studio City area?  Suggestions, please.

@everythingloria Thanks, Glo!  We miss you at the HIMYM!  It's Episode 101, called 'Jenkins'. Amanda Peet guest stars. She's rad.
Directing HIMYM this week. Equal parts overwhelm, education, and exhilaration. But directing while acting in a scene - very strange.  Meta.
Holy didn't really appreciate my last tweet.  Meant no historical disrespect. Twas a joke about my pointing pics only. Sorry. I'm tired.
Two Secret Service agents tackled me as I went up to Robert Kennedy Jr., pulled my hand out of my pocket and pointed at his gut. So no pic.
Sitting in hotel.  Doorbell!  In walks Bobby Kennedy.  Yeah, I just chilled with Bobby Kennedy.  That's how I roll.  Pointing pic to come!
Just arrived into Park City.  Entirely unprepared for the weather.  I somehow realized that I would be skiing, yet forgot it would be cold!
Come experience Accomplice: Hollywood, a show I'm co-producing in L.A. Watch: www.nikkidesmond.com for backstory. Kinda treasure-hunty.

Wi-fi during your flight is the greatest advancement in aviation since, well, the airplane.
