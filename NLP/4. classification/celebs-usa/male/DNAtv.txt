Just watched @AnandWrites intellectually eviscerate the unfailingly bland, embarrassingly uninformed perspective on "Justice" shared by Noah Rothman, who clearly didn't talk to any Browns, Females or Humans before writing his ridiculous book. #MorningJoe
Howard Schultz is profoundly arrogant. Sounds good on paper, half-baked in person. Had he run as a DEM he might be a contender. By going it alone it's clear he has no idea how govt works. We can't afford another amateur in the highest office in the land. #MorningJoe
Howard Schultz thinks that his personal story is sufficient to transform Washington DC. With zero policy prescriptions other than "bringing ppl together". How can a man this "successful" be this basic? #MorningJoe
Watching Howard Schultz flub the basic question from @WillieGeist on why he's not running as a DEM. He imagines that one "non-partisan" guy can transform govt. Trump has already proven that PARTY matters for all 3 branches. How does ONE GUY change everyone else??? #MorningJoe

@francismmaxwell @ChuckModi1 It's easy to demonize the victims of oppression when the alternative is to acknowledge you might be a beneficiary of their oppression. And while you're busy punching down, the oppressor-in-chief is standing on your neck too...
@francismmaxwell @ChuckModi1 This is exactly the dynamic that fuels the ignorant MAGA crowd today, as well as the backlash against Central American migrants fleeing the nations we helped destroy.
This is a perfect corollary for what was done to Haiti. Make an example of the "liberated" by crippling them out the gate, and then use their consequent struggles as proof that that were always unworthy of liberty. https://t.co/vpVDMmqkmy
The call for #GeneralStrike needs to come from outside the Beltway, from a coalition of groups. Most effective would be veterans groups in solidarity w the Coast Guard, TSA &amp; general natsec.
