Well, joke if u want to but I have seen the future. There WILL be a Space Force. It’s first unmanned, command/control center (that eventually careens out into oblivion) will be named the I.M. TRUMP. It will be recognized for generations as having been absolutely useless. https://t.co/3kwCL8G1DQ
Or a day that perhaps isn’t rainy too? Maybe? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Thanks y’all for the shoutout! https://t.co/e017uzvOHk
This is some kind of weird, lefty news media joke... right? Right?? Oh what... it’s actually true? What the FUCKing FUCK?!? https://t.co/PcPusRItsL
If only our elected officials had this brand of dedication to what democracy is meant to be... https://t.co/oAKgc06Ofl
This dude was everything Hollywood has forgotten about. He made people smile because they recognized he was in love with his ridiculous job. I hope those not familiar will explore his contributions to the joy of movies. He IS the #1 reason I pursued my ridiculous job. https://t.co/bEsB8oYnTK
It’s unfathomable that human beings experiencing this undeniable reality can somehow still champion a president who simply says it’s not happening.  (This statement can of course be repurposed for pretty much any other non climate change issue as well.)  https://t.co/4xcWGFJOSv
Our President is nothing short of an asteroid we may be able to do nothing about. He is a global threat and should be recognized as such by the global community. America is no longer in the driver’s seat. I hope the world will step up for us as we have for it in the past ✌️🇺🇸
Nothin but fun making this record with y’all. Thanks so much for everything... https://t.co/n9DzcJHhZ2

Watch this whole thing. If you disagree with this man’s sentiments I can safely say I wish for u to remove yourself from this Twitter account. And I wish u good luck in the psychotic America this president’s policies intend to foreshadow and promote. https://t.co/YJv1MYTaRC
Dunno why it hasta say “Explicit”. Are ANY words even offensive anymore in this current culture?  https://t.co/2i3GKSejnD Aaanyway, WORLD PREMIERE VID “Always Trouble” coming within 48(ish) hrs. ✌️🤘🖤

Jesus Christ @GOP do u really think this festering, lie spewing, ass wound u call ur leader is sustainable?!! U all still have a chance to escape to a sanctuary city called THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.

There should be ZERO circumstances under which the President Of The United States and leader of the free world asks the public for sympathy. This one asking for apologies as a diversion to sentiments he won’t denounce only speaks to what a small human being this country elected.
It is beyond comprehension how any person with even minimal understanding of human compassion could support this sociopathic policy. Memorial Day honors not only the fallen, but the values they died for. 🇺🇸 Contact your Reps! https://t.co/Onr7Elo6eZ https://t.co/1Ts7TFDCiW
Dear @Seahawks, to whom I’ve given my heart thru thick and thin since their 1976 inception into this now sadly, politically ($$) dominated league- It is with heavy heart that I must remove myself from fanship of any franchise that would adhere to this 1st Amendment abomination.
Glad you’re um “home?”🤔and doing well Melania (spellcheck). Words cannot express how sorry we are about the dude you married. Perhaps when you FULLY recover you’ll realize how much you don’t need him anymore...🤙😉 https://t.co/zXl9efNi0W
American coal. As clean and odor free as the Presidential bowel movements (and tax records??).  Do something about American kids getting murdered in American schools, Your HighNess. https://t.co/mLA0Uf0XIh
So yeah, America... I love you 🇺🇸, but guess what... we fucking suck right now. And it seems like you’re cool with that.
Our society was founded on the simple principle that common sense should outweigh the selfish interests of those we keep in power. Allowing this 2 be acceptable while those we keep in the HIGHEST of power offer nothing but prayers defies all common sense.  https://t.co/ncD7nItl0h
I love this so much it makes me wanna cry https://t.co/eGdEZGSmxL
I know my twit habits are sparse esp when it comes to promoting my own gigs, but having just seen @breakinginmovie I feel like I gotta tell u... I think y’all r gonna enjoy the hell outa this one ✊️ #gomoms https://t.co/RrdeRuLUxg
I’ve concluded that trying not to be moved in any way by @AmericanIdol is like trying to deny that puppies are cute even though they’re shitting on your rug right in front of you. Despite the commercialism, at it’s core its a show about possibilities. We need that. ✊️🇺🇸✌️👏

I honestly seek not to start some lame, directionless Twitter feud with this gentleman, but this bears sharing given that it couldn’t make any less sense even if he’d spellchecked America. I wish him well though. #AmetiricFirst https://t.co/ftriLAbD1I
What will it take for @realDonaldTrump supporters to realize that what they want most (protection from a nefarious government) is being stolen right before their eyes with the cruelest of weapons? INDIFFERENCE. Wake, people! Please WAKE!! https://t.co/qJUzC1Hg0N
Bless this man with an R in front of his name. This man who can support his 2nd amendment values and still have the humanity and balls to call out his fellow R’s. “R’s are not going to do a SINGLE THING” and “D’s work for incremental wins” #FlipTheHouse 🇺🇸✌️❤️ https://t.co/EywsbBDAH2
Quite possibly the “coldest” &amp; surely one of the most ignorant statements a sitting  president has ever spat upon his own citizens, let alone humanity. For those who continue to believe this man gives a shit about u, I can only hope your children &amp; their children find reason. https://t.co/mDfc0f9iRE

Big ups and thanx to @jayjan300 &amp; @RadixDance this weekend for teaching my daughter &amp; all the kids not only some sick tap steps, but some killer philosophy on work ethic &amp; gratitude in between. Good on ya, Jason
Oh my good lord, if ur not watching @godlessnetflix ... or if u are and don’t think it’s the most superb modern day western cinema ever... ur either stupid, or I am. Cast, storytelling, production design, direction, cinematography ALL divine. Wish movies were still this good. A+
And for those asking... the new album I’ve been sitting on like an OCD mother hen... IS indeed coming... 2018 🎼🎸🎤🤘
Don’t know who this kid is but he seems to be pretty pleased with himself. Perhaps he knows that his present hair do won’t look nearly as bad in comparison to those of his future self.  Thank u everyone everywhere for the lovely birthday greetings and wishes.  -bb https://t.co/4SgSqwFwM9

On a lighter yet even more eerily ironic note... America, consider your pussy officially grabbed.
That said, I believe Trump is an unkind, insincere, thoughtless, immature human being whom I truly hope we can all help to evolve himself.
I believe that voters truly believed in what they wanted. What I question is if they truly understood what they'd be getting. We shall see.

Anyway to re-cap: web address coming very soon, album release (tentatively) June 22, recruits and recruiters much appreciated. Much Love -bb
I promise it won't be what's expected. I realize the bad taste it can leave in your mouth when an actor decides to take a musical ego trip..
...a few hundred thousand singles, we got a good shot at shakin' up the labels and the suits. Sound like fun?
and ya know, give this thing a good ol' grass roots fighting chance... If we can get to a million or so and give away let's say...
all u gotta do is sign up at my new website (coming soon). What I'd like to do before then is welcome in some new followers...
So... as I've mentioned before, I'm droppin' an album in June. U will ALL be getting a free download of one of the 1st singles if u want one
http://twitpic.com/1dyvsi - no, that's not a chick's hand. it is indeed, mine.
What a lovely response. You're all lovely. Speaking of lovely, a pic of lovely manicure work done right here in lovely Shreve, comin' up...
If i put up a pic of me with the nails, can i get some of ya'll to help me with somethin? A lil' booster project  for what's coming in June?
I'd post a pic but... ya know, don't really wanna give too much away. But maybe. Stay tuned...
Days off- walk to casino, sit @ poker table, try not to lose money while deflecting stares, questions & comments about wearing acrylic nails
Life in The "Shreve": Work days- go to set, put on makeup, leather pants, more rings than Liberace, try to function wearing acrylic nails...
I'm in Palm Springs with the fam for the weekend. Just felt the quake pretty good here.
@Thehaleyfuentes  U win Haley. Welcome to the show.
Do you believe in magical atmospheres? Places where Heaven becomes reality? Like to visit one?  ... Shreveport, Louisiana awaits *~`
@Pandee77... I hope Charlie's 'stache doesn't say any thing stupid at the release party he's supposedly attending. He can be very brash.
The drop comes this Summer. More info to follow in the coming weeks...
Initial tracking for my 1st supersonic record album is now complete. Into the mix for a bit while i make a movie with Nick Cage & friends...
Hooray 4 Hollywood u may be homely in ur neighborhood but if u think that u can be an actor see Mr. Factor he'll make a monkey look good ;)
I made guesses based on what I've heard from the "pundits" and SHOCK, they were right. Hmm. What's that say about who wins and who's a dog?
Here's the capper- I won my Oscar pool having seen only 2 ( +a bit of one on a plane) of the 10 major movies nominated!! ... which means...
...included in the montage was "The Silence Of The Lambs" which won 5 Oscars in 1992-- among them-- Best Picture!!! Who's writing this crap?
Horror film tribute?? HUH?? What was that even about? 37 years since they've been recognized (for The Exorcist)?? Uh, WRONG...
...will say that presenting Makeup was the funniest, most subtle and oddly genuine performance Ben Stiller has given in, well... ever?  nice
sadly not much else to inspire either venom or praise... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Well, the getting buzzed part happened...
Shit. Oscar night. Hope I don't get & buzzed and start spewing a bunch of bitter, spite-ridden comments all over this page. Stay tuned...
I wonder where billy's been. He hasn't tweeted in a very long time... http://silvatarmedia.com/removal
1st official night of recording complete. I will NOT allow this to sound like "aging actor getting ego jollys by making a record". (i think)
@jaimeepperson .... happy birthday jaimee. not gonna lie, 21 is gettin up there. please don't fall and break a hip. x
Takin a break to have some peeps over for dinner in pajamas. Could get messy... or sleepy... or "Spice channel"... or all of the above.
Locked in with the asbestos and roaches writing songs for the lil' record album. Will return periodically with crumbs from the cellar... *~*
Can't figure out if I feel cheap and whorish. Did an "at home" photo shoot today for UK mags. Balanced it out with some studio time though.
@sunray16 Happy Birthday Sunray. Sorry ur getting old.
As some may notice... I'm taking requests of late. Cheers Chix.
Back from Jolly old Englandland. Had a pretty sweet holiday. Always odd to find I don't hate LA as much as I thought when I come back.
@Pandee77     Word... to u and yours
@Stellar143 slowly but... yep ok
Happy New Year to all. Don't get disappointed if you don't have an awesome time tonight. It's only an accident if u do. Just grin and rock.
29 years ago today a true original was born. Happy birthday to the lovely and amazing Pollyanna Rose. I love you Baby.
Much love to Gil's friend Meadow. xxoo
Hope I wasn't too tired and crappy on GMTV.
Still in London. Chiswick to be exact. Jolly ol F'n times. West End play tonite folllowed by festivities...
Shite. No possible way to figger out who number 8 is. I'm grabbin someone though...
just on for a sec. dunno how to make decisions like this so... the 8th person I hear from (my favorite #) is getting followed. more to come.
Holy F-knot. A lotta pretty tasty & tangy responses. Gonna take me awhile to giggle thru'em. Heart & darling cynicism never goes unnoticed.
So I just realized I'm only following 7 peeps. Dunno why, jus peeps I know I guess. S'pose I could follow sum more, but who... and why them?
Lookin for gift ideas? Proceeds go to VH1 Save The Music which I've been a long time supporter of-  http://www.vh1bigshopping.com/node/742
Those in the UK, looks like I'll be doing GMTV the 22nd and some other random stuff in the London area cuz we'll be there for the holidays.
Got some shite brewin for the coming year. Workin' on some music in rare spare time for a record that we hope to release next summer...
Been workin' some funky hours again. Droppin in to say thanks imdb players but alas, it looks like we're being out-logged. No worries...
Many requests to play imdb lotto some more. Who am I to argue? Need the link? K, here you go-  www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605/ Shameless? Nah.
All those who played my imdb game... we're now at #12. OK, so the movie just came out but let's take the credit. Number 1 is only 11 away. X
I posted an exclusive Video to my iphone app. http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=318589882&mt=8
For those in the LA area, i'll be doing something on the KTLA morning news tmorow as well. Not quite sure what.
I'll be of course working tmorow on another gig. Would not wish any differently. Hope u all have a kick ass turkey day...
So many Happy Birthdays. Never gotten this many in my life. Much love back to u all...
Hey-wanna thank everybody for the kind words. Glad ur diggin' the flick. More later...
Thanks to the fans here in  Toronto. Good times.
In Toronto introducing another pre-screening. When I get back home I'll start posting some vids on the app.
Goin to tape a segment for WCBS evening news...  then VH1 Save The Music event somewhere in Times Square...
Jus finished Ch. 11 morning news here in NYC. Apologies to those who suffered "morning burke"

There's a very tight community on the app so if u decide to get it, be gracious to them and i'm sure they'll return the favor. Love u girls
I've been asked to try and capture some of the chaos and upload it to my app. So I guess if you don't have it...
Apparently, there's some big deal going on in Westwood tonight...
and i'll be introducing the special screening of NM that night as well i'm told. as well as the one the next night in Toronto. C U there...
So I'm gonna be at this VH1 Save The Music event on Weds in NYC. It's one o my fave orgs. www.vh1savethemusic.com/
Wow. Jesus, I've been lame lately huh? What an ass.

good to see all who were there. sorry bout the uncomfortable-ness of the ill-conceived Q&A of it all. never quite comes across in the chaos
Goin to see Death Cab @ H'wood & Highland tonight. They're from Bellingham too. Weird.

@ClaudiaPope  Well...y'know, i can't stop people from doing what they wanna do, right?? *wink, wink*
@LynzMichelle -- man cards?? look who's talkin.
@ClaudiaPope   hmm. dunno. sounds a little shameless... even for me.
@ClaudiaPope ... ooo, sounds EF-a-licious. How??
so i guess our little fun car hit a wall on the imdb thing (down 48%). dunno what happened. oh well, it was cute while it lasted.
@tylrnclrbnsn um... i dunno. I guess I'll let u know if I ever do work with him???
http://twitpic.com/nz46d - halloween '09 me & polly as Sid & Nancy

@bekahkatherine nope... and my life is way more normal than what everyone's perception might be.
@Mary_Toko Hey Mary, looks like persistence pays. Hope all's good witchu... XO   -bb
@MsHorseThief Whoa, wait a sec... who the F is this??
@itscandacebitch @Redeyed_Chelsea @ItsXander @kinesis311 -- Shouted. Where are the Swan's online? Anyway, rock on Cullens.
@heatherinheels It ain't over 'til the vampires cry. Dig?
@LynzMichelle Agreed... and agreed.
@iamcaraa Please... let's try and forget that movie ever happened. gracias.
@ashleyfrag yes, i think i mentioned my mucho appreciation for the appreciation. XXXand 000
@feefeevieira   Is it Oi or Oy or Hola or ... shit, i forget. anyway, Hi Brazil.
@amberjusm @TIFFANY_TWIST3D @loganch www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605/ ...there u go
@PaulSilverWolf Nah, New Moon's still up plenty.
we're at #157 from 400 something 2 weeks ago so... that's pretty sweet. thanks for playin evryone.
K, dont get discouraged. Only 45% this week cuz as we get closer to the top the competition gets thicker. Get it? We're actually kickin ass.
Wanna give a shout out to the cast & crew of HP. Had a kick ass time amongst the oddities and chaos. Much loves.
Officially wrapped "Highland Park". Back home tmorrow to see my sweet ones. Appreciate the appreciation btw. Tweet u's from Hollywoodland.
jus got off work btw. not that anyone would find it curious that i'm up this late. wrap tomorrow on this shin-dig in Detroit.
@laHummle i don't know exactly how it works. that was kinda the impetus for the experiment. tryin to find out how they get they're numbers.
Once again, the numbers change weekly. Results will show up Monday. Yea, self indulgence rules!
for those confused-- u don't hafta DO anything. just click on the link -  www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605/ ...and ur misson is complete.
for those still game, #1 is the goal...  www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605/ i mean unless u think RobPatz needs a bit more exposure. let's do this
@SmeyerJR Fuckers. totally my idea. i want royalties. (like that'll happen)
@Daydas Never been to Brazil but from what I hear it's pretty bitchin'. If there's a Twi-gig down there I'll be sure and try to make it.
@dragonflycurls Holy crap that's pretty awesome. First thing I saw when i just logged on. I AM saving the pic. Nicely done, young lady.
@jkennedy80 Rankings are on imdbPRO but i think that might be a pay site. Anyway, we're at #228 right now.
here's the link again- www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605/ - is number ONE possible? What'll they do when Burke comes outa nowhere??
Yes, I realize this is completely self-indulgent but... whatev. Nobody's gettin' harmed. Just manipulating the system for fun cuz we can.
thank you all so much for indulging... that was fun. Anyone up for seeing how far we can take this thing??
Well, well. So it seems we've discovered that the numbers actually are (at least in part) based on something real. Nicely done, people...
Much love to all playing along. The numbers change weekly I believe, so we'll see how we did on Monday. FIGHT THE POWER. xxxxxx
Jus fer fun.... let's see shall we??  www.imdb.com/name/nm0121605/
I wonder what would happen if EVERYONE following me right now hit my stupid fuckin' imdb page for a straight 72 hours?????.....
As some know, I'm a bit of a fan of F'ing with those who hold what could be considered "synthetic" power...
I'm curious how their "Star Meter" works. Is it just an arbitrary system that they control on their own? Or is it based on real math??...
here i am, once again when everyone's retired. jus logged onto imdb for the 1st time in awhile. anyone wanna try an experiment??
Much love to EVERYONE who put their heart and guts into it. Until we meet again..........
Big shout out to the ever so lovely David Slade et al. Had, once again, an excellent time creating with these peeps another SAGA installment
@Mary_Toko Think i owe u a hi. so... hi. and thanks.
Movie I'm doing in Detroit is called "Highland Park" for those asking. IMDB page is not up to date for it yet though. Be shooting til 10/24
then straight to Detroit ROCK CITY for my other movie. For all u swooning girlies out there... RobPatz was looking especially darling tonite
Just wrapped what i THOUGHT was gonna be my last day on Eclipse. Oh, how wrong i was. Gotta come back Monday for more fun & games...
BD would be quite a ways off. long time for unnecessary facial hair. resurrection is always a possibility. RIP for now lil stachey.
maybe i'll have a funeral for the mustache
yeah, so been a lil busy of late. 2 movies at once. heading back to Vancouver on thurs for charlie's LAST DAY of shooting...
BTW, being a crossword clue DOES actually consecrate one's arrival into venerated history. I humbly await my anointment ceremony.
Leavin early tmorow back to Vancouver. Regret to inform that i may not make the London Twi-gig in Oct. Another pic in the works. Letcha know
so, it was... passable. not fantastic. overcooked the fish a bit. the salsa was pretty kick ass though. crazy spicy.
Making baked halibut with homemade mango salsa. Betcha didn't peg me for a domestic type, huh? Well me neither. Letcha know how it turns out
Michael Jackson generated ka-Jillions of $$ for that raging shit storm they call a TV station and THAT'S how they honor him??!!
wait, don't get me wrong-- the Kanye moment was SADLY the most entertaining part of the show. and the MJ tribute... shameful.
The KWest bit was just a microcosm. Poor guy must be starting to feel as insignificant and desperate as MTV and it's 17 remaining viewers.
The VMA's. Wow. What an embarrassment. I grew up in the original MTV era. They revolutionized popular culture. Now they're puking on it.
the rough cut of a movie yesterday that i'm not allowed to tell you about. you'll be able to see it on 11/20/2009.
ok, been AWOL again but here i am late hours as usual counting down to the Seahawks opener against the Rams. that's all i got. oh and i saw-
@MsAshleyH19 HOLY CRAP! tell your mom i say hi! she was my favorite bartender. i basically grew up at Palmers.
to answer as many as i can- shot some scenes, have more to go, evryone's cool, no major bulls#it, paps r rabid, fans r sweet, all is rockin.
yes, i am alive. jus got home for a couple weeks. giving the stache a rest until late september. catch me in the later hours as usual...
I posted an exclusive photo to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
I posted an exclusive Voice Message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
Just sitting here in my hotel room with uncomfortable images of PFach and Lutz together in a tandem lotus position. mmmm, dreamy.
jus got to hotel in Vancouver. start tmorow early. someone gets a cap and gown. g'nite for now.
@LynzMichelle -- done. beddie-bye for bb now.

@LynzMichelle - dunno what that really would entail. go to the app chat
reading a script. zzzzzzz. it can be trying sometimes.
jus gonna put out a massive HI to all who are up and requesting. had a family BBQ tonight here in the hometown. no drama, so that's... good.
well, it's 11:11. bout time for me to see waht's tweeting.

Goin to Seahawks preseason game vs. Denver tonight. Family has kick ass season ticket seats... and it's beautiful out. yeah, life's rough.
on my way out to din in Seattle. question: what the hell does "Follow Friday" mean?
I think RT means Re-Think what you tweet before you tweet it. G'night.
is it weird that i think its weird that people ask if its weird if they think they have a crush on ol' charlie swan? is that so weird? weird
i'm not in vancouver yet. next week.
sorry, cant keep up. gettin good cards
@LynzMichelle ... nope. is that broken too?
@tucheer83 .. sweet. much love.
@LynzMichelle... phone is retired for the night. did u get the Q and A question?
@hello_jodie ....poker and twitter. good one
playin a lil poker on line. hafta spend free time wisely
@LynzMichelle @got2bekidding ....hey
k, thanks all. 100's of RT answers. think i get it now. sorry to those for whom my tweeting hours miss. i'm a nighty not a day-ee
and hey, if anyone wants to call this DOUCHE out for completely bastardizing my words in US weekly, Philip.Kim@usmagazine.com - feel free
can someone tell me what RT means?
So, can't make the New Jersey gig. Sorry all. That's the day I start this movie called Eclipse. I play a character called "Charlie Swan".
and scrutinize the "journalists" before they fall for what is written with complete abandon and recklessness. end of rant.
i don't actually care enough to dignify it. enough said. I would only ask that people use they're common sense...
3 totally separate sentences take WAY out of context. Shame. Would love to hear they're rationalization for this mis-quote, but here again..
@IrishTwiSisters Ok people, for the record, I said nothing even remotely close to what these peeps are quoting...
@Angie1007 u got one now. chin up, kiddo. ya never know what's gonna trigger the ol' mustache into responding.
hey. just want evryone to know, i totally dig u ALL. i mean that. but i cant respond to EVERY tweet so dont get pissed at me...
They own all rights to cheesy movie mustaches as well.
What's this I hear? That halo is patented. Exclusive property of... well, Summit I guess.
What'
@LynzMichelle yeah, the prob is- i don't run my facebook. they set it up. i haven't gotten that deep into my computer usage yet.
@LynzMichelle what does that mean?
So, my app update F'd up the app even more. Sorry to those it's affecting.  And yeah can't make Phoenix or Chicago. Bummer.
Haven't been able to update the app. That's why it's on the fritz. Workin on it.
I posted an exclusive chat message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
@amandazufolo WORD!! I guess i didn't win a teen choice award either. Thought for sure there would be a "best facial hair" category.
Regret to inform that I will not be able to make Phoenix. The gig I'm doing prevails. Apologies to all. Much love.
Goin to the Inglouriuos Basterds premiere Monday. @therealbasterds. Heard it's old school Tarantino. In which case, should be pretty sweet.
On the set of the indy movie i'm squeezing in before Eclipse. The guy I'm playing could kick a vampire's ass with his mind. (and a lunchbox)
I just want a Charlie Swan lunch box. Is that too much to ask?
I'm sure Facinelli is is dreaming up campaign tactics as we speak. Oh come on, just kidding Pete.
um... although i appreciate the sentiment of being nominated Mr. Twitter, I'm not sure i would want the title. not exactly my style, dig?
I posted an exclusive chat message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
Dallas. Hmm, well people were sweet. Nothin but luv to those I did meet. Other than that, got nuthin to tweet.
I have NO idea what went down with the Rachelle thing. None whatsoever. Bit confused myself. I gotta go bowling now. More later...
@AshleyK_Elliott -- Holes in the wall. Now yer speakin my language. Gimme a list, yo.
Anyway yeah, Dallas. This weekend. Who's comin? What's a guy like me do in the Big D?
Revisiting my roots as the "despicable" guy on episodic TV is enjoyable every now and again. I pretty much began my career with those roles.
In response to all "The Closer" questions- there are are no plans to return to the show as of yet. But I did have fun playing Mr. Stroh.
Starting a new flick this week. Under the radar, dark, psycho, bones & blood brain teaser. I'll mutter stuff from the set when i can. Word?
F¥(kin A. Feel outa touch w/my twit world. Doin my best to chk in but 2 much blah goin on. Dallas anyone?
there. everyone was very sweet and enthusiastic and groovy.
so it seemed like our comiccon experience was over before it started. too much hustle not enough time with the fans. thanks to all who were
So far we've been herded from theatre to theatre to say hi to peeps and then rushed back out.
I posted an exclusive chat message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
I'll try to let ya'll know what goes down as it does. Those of u who have it. Tune into the app.
So we're locked in a hotel suite at a secret local in San Diego. Q&A soon. Pandemonium here.
I posted an exclusive chat message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS

anyway, i'll try and be more present when all this s#!t is over with on Monday. I'll be at special screenings and such @ ComiCon on Thurs...

@mamajalapa umm... ok , where's the live app page??? like i said, i'm computer stupid. tryin my best to keep up.
I posted an exclusive Voice Message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
The one you're all thinking of I have not read yet. But yes... I do have it in my possession. Got it last night.
So i gotta sit down and read a script tonight. Procrastinating. Reading makes my brain hurt. And if the script is bad, anger sets in.
I posted an exclusive chat message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
@jhopewood happy bi®thday. you're legal. behave. (or not)
...a massive shout out and thanks. WONKA!!
Speaking of candy, the WONKA company is being kind enough to drop off a load of goodies for my daughter's 1st birthday! So i wanna give them
anyway it's only $1.99. you can't even get a decent candy bar for that these days.
so the app has "dropped" as the hip kids say. looks pretty sweet. gonna take me awhile to figger out howta make it kick ass but...
Got some stuff in the works that may take awhile.
So, I think the app will be available tomorrow. Still workin on it. I'm computer stupid.
I posted an exclusive Voice Message to my iphone app. http://bit.ly/6JgWS
That being said, we'll try to make it worth your while-- know what I means, Jelly Beans?? Let's have some funs, Hamburger Buns.
Now listen- as most of you know, I'm not the warm and fuzzy tweety, tweet-tweeter type, so we're gonna try and keep this genuine. Dig?
So i guess my App is getting set up tomorrow. Don't have a clue how it all works but apparently there R some new bells and whistles on it.
Didn't win the whole thing tonight (poker tourney) but finished in the top 20. Too many distractions if ya know what I mean. (Not ALL good)
Really had a groovy experience with the peeps in Atlanta. Can't thank you all enough. Lookin forward to next time wherever it may be.
got off the plane from Atlanta and ... uuhhh had to go straight to the Playboy Mansion for a charity poker game. God my life is sooo ruff.
Shout outs to- melsvfp, kalicokel, jeanna420, kendallzaqt. Thanks for comIng.
Great people, lotta laughs (a few tears). Nice to have folks who get my dopey sense o humor. Thanks to all.
So, jus finished a QnA @ TwiCon Atlanta. Had lotsa fun with it actually...
Anyway, I'll be canoeing my way down to Atlanta for the shin-dig they have planned on Friday. S'pose I'll see some of you there. Yes?
my virginity is still in tact.
Went AWOL again for a couple days. Got lost in the woods and made really good friends with some toothless banjo players. Don't worry...
@SarahKeene I never make fun of a poet. I appreciate all. I will say-mostly, the less literal the better for my taste. Don't be afraid.
Best damn down home 4th of July in ages. The 4 F's-- Family, friends, food and fireworks. Perhaps a few more F's still to come... whoo hoo!
We who live in relatively free societies should remember how F'ing lucky we are now and again. Dunno, feelin patriotic tonight i guess.
That reference to the Declaration Of Independence was not to be taken cynically, btw. Everyone should read it again and soak it in...
"When in the course of human events it becomes necessary..." barbeque some stuff and light some shit on fire. Happy 4th of July people.
@alexandralayne I WILL be at ComicCon unless unseen forces prevent. Think these tweets are sporadic?? Wait til I'm on a REAL holiday.
And I actually haven't seen ONE reference to NASCAR yet. Seems you can buy a fishing pole almost anywhere though.
Man, it's green here. I'm from WA state and I thought that was green. The peeps have been awfully nice too. Very polite and hospitable.
@phorine Sadly, I was there to buy diapers and formula. The Target here doesn't sell Vodka??!! Oh, the hardships I must endure.
When I said no she asked me if I knew Brad Pitt. I told her "Know HIM?? I'm having an affair with him. Haven't you heard?"
So it's quite nice here in NC so far. The cashier at Target asked me if I was invited to Michael Jackson's funeral...
Now if you'll excuse me I have to get in my gas guzzling limousine to get to the airport. Goodnight, all. Speak to u from NASCAR land.
Like I said... deep thoughts, always.
Nothin personal against the racing fans, but funny how with all the concern about fossil fuel usage- no one ever mentions THIS F'N SPORT???
NASCAR. That's the sport where people drive around in a continual left hand turn, right?
Anyway, leaving for North Carolina tonight. Any clues on s#!t to do there? (aside from my secret rendezvous with a certain heart-throb)
@DawnDaynNight -- I was probly just thinkin about havin an In N' Out burger
@DawnDaynNight Yes my thoughts are ALWAYS deep. My complexity is chilling and relentlessly perverse. Oh, how i long for dreams of dandelions
Maybe i'll text him to see if he's thinking about me. But alas, I fear the truth. Damn you KStew. Damn YOU Rob. A curse on u both!
@dri_antunes That would be one swarthy, debonair kid.
I wonder how long it will take for it to come out that RPatz and I are dating. Apparently I'm completely captivated by him.
@allisonfuller87-hmm... Honestly don't remember saying any of that. Don't really sound like my words, do they? He's worth the hype???
@KatieLibey waiting patiently for the dudes to get the app in gear. thanks for the PERSISTENCE (and patience)
ok . new night. hair issues are long behind us. don't really know what's happening with the iphone app but it's supposed to be coming soon.
Ahh I love venting when I'm in a crispy mood and somebody throws me their unsolicited opinion.
He'll I'm just happy to HAVE enough hair for it to look stupid without a comb-over for god's sake.
If I'm growing it out for another gig and it's perhaps going thru an awkward stage let's just leave that alone, K?
I must address tucheer83's comments about my hair -- back off chick. I'm an actor not a model. Dig?
To add to that, because of the awards show, I was severly overdressed for the party we went to after. Yee haw.
Was a pleasure showin up for a great cause but then... well I gotta say I'm jus not a huge fan of bday parties.
So yeah did the Vision awards then went to a friends bday party...
goin to play some poker now. need some luck. haven't had much lately. hope everyone's well and kickin ass. watch for late nite tweets *_~
we'll see how embarrassing it turns out.
so i've been AWOL for awhile. back home for just a few days. we'll be editing a lil "chicken fried". can't promise a posting but...
I will tell him when I see him Evelyn, K? Whatever you're going thru, remember these words-- It's just for now.
Dunno Evelyn, sounds daunting. Whata u got?
Shout out to Caryn69 and jorosep. I do the best i can to respond to as many as i can, K? ...much love
For all you daddy's girls out there, jus remember it never takes much to melt your dad's heart. She'll be a year old next month btw. thanks
My daughter presented me with a card this morning (with a lil help from mommy). It put me instantly into another stratosphere.
It was very strange to get messages on my phone today wishing me a happy father's day. Never thought it would apply to me.
i promise if this vid turns out as funny as it seems right now, i'll post it. (probly jus funny to US)
I'm not even old enough to be Bella's dad FairLady ;)
shout out to EvelynEpstein! sweet guitar pic baby!
so now we're a little whacked and shooting our own music video to the "Chicken Fried" song. funny what margaritas will do.
Sorry ya'll. We're on vacation so I've been a bit lame at the tweets. Having some margueritas. Don't be jealous.
but i can't be positive. it was however, 4 or 5 weeks ago.
What?! I'm on the MTV cast list for New Moon?? I hope they didn't make a mistake. I vaguely remember shooting some scenes with a moustache
so i'm answering questions for an online interview and i've been working on the first answer all day. "Tell us how your career began"
wow, that was a long dinner i had last nite
throwing some steaks on. (i know, my life is rough) back in a bit
i'm not ashamed to to say that it's two parts Malibu rum, one part pineapple juice, a lil ice and a whole lotta love.
104 degrees in Palm Desert. wearing nothing but a smile. only thing that's upsetting me is the absence of an umbrella in my drink.
talk to ya'll tmorow from a secret location in the California desert.  Pieces and Love  -bb
U too MsJBell. wish i had a prize.
U win il_mio_cuore!!!!! much love--
i like a lil bit'a chicken fried... for all you cats in the south who know what i'm talkin about. (but it might be past ur bedtime)
listen, u peeps are the only ones that matter. couldn't care less about the non-RECOGNIZAS. jus like to throw $#!t at'em... cuz it's fun.
aahh. nice to come here and get some fuzzy love. i love u all.
interesting. i guess i'm not in New Moon according to their cast list. can't wait to see this movie i wasn't around for.
so dinner was... moderately satisfying. and then to add to my indigestion i followed Pete's link to the MTV New Moon site...
eating a couple wieners. be back in a bit.
just BBQing some sausages (easy now, i mean that literally) for dinner. then might watch some "I"M A CELEBRITY, GET ME A CAREER"
who's causing trouble tonight? anyone? I wanna see some questionable behavior.
so um... wow. looks like this Facinelli thing is getting way out of hand. what's he gonna do with all those followers. i'm scared.
easy adairish, pay attention, we're all friends here. speaking of... what up CHICAGO?! and as for the UK... my lovely lady is a brit. Oi Oi
hmm, i see the burning question is already up on the Lexicon. the little hairy monster does indeed have a life of its own. and yes its REAL
maybe the stache becomes a werewolf in book 6.
glad u got the Rocky Horror reference, Danya. nice!
--pation
i see there are already a lot of strong opinions. yes, i say a campaign is in order. i can feel my upper lip quivering with antici--
jus sayin. wonder what the final tally would be. Oi BRAZILl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! gotta get my a$s down there someday.
what if... for Eclipse, Chuck Swan actually parted with the &lt;!#k broom on his upper lip?
or maybe... fer reals
what say we get the SWAN TRAIN up to oh... 100,000 give or take a couple hundred thou and THEN we have an actual vote. ya know, jus fer fun
here's what i'm thinking...
i wonder what the consensus would be if the Twi fans put it to a vote...
i've been seen without any facial hair. (Charlie's moustache now has it's own makeup trailer)
jus some pics with a brilliant friend photog seein' if he can make me look presentable. got me thinkin. it's been a long while since...
whoa. just looked for the first time today. up over the10 grand mark. lovely. jus got back from a photo shoot. got an idea. more later...
15 championships. most of any coach in any major sport EVER. props, Phil.
good to hear from ya Gil. hope all's well. what up AUSTIN?! love that town. and hell, i gotta give it up for the Lakers and Phil Jackson.
i got Gil's back. who else needs love? and who's got some new muzak for me? New Zealand??
get some of those ka-jillion Facinelli followers to HOP ABOARD THE SWAN TRAIN BABY!
yeah Oi. that's what i meant. anyway so i'm following Pete. now what? i know. maybe we could...
i guess Pete's chair back IS a valuable piece of memorabilia... but still... HOLA BRAZIL!
I could be wrong but i think i've already seen Rob in a bikini...
i wonder what WE can get from either of these two fine gentlemen. I mean what's in it for us, right?? must think hard about this...
ok. um... always up for a lil gambling. but who to choose?? after all i consider Rob my friend too. hmm... this'll be interesting
dinner time.... and it better be good. my lovely Pollyanna wants to say bon soir to y'all too... so g'night fer now
shout out to Brazil, soft hotel towels, Texas, alienation, overrated things, good natured haters... and NYC!!!
somebody better tackle me before i alienate the entire greater Los Angeles area, so here... big ups to East Hollywood.
spending the night in a bev hills hotel. won't say the name, but so far... OVERRATED. (much like bev hills itself) oops did i say that?
it's a metaphorical lake people. c'mon, stick with me here. and it IS a GUY singing. the girl plays bass. my bad.
song i can't stop listening to for all u Silversun fans-Panic Switch. beautifully dark. sounds like she's singing from the bottom of a lake.
brilliant Saroyal... the Law of Comedy. Love it
look at it this way Laker fans- at least LA doesn't have a football team for me to root against.  and btw-- GO SEAHAWKS!!!
i guess those court-side seats won't be coming anytime soon either
i hope Jack Nicholson never sees that last one. he'll never work with me. (as if he was clammering to before)
here's a tidbit that may disappoint some and bring a smile to others. i am NOT a Lakers fan. it warms my heart when they lose. go Magic.
i know i've been really boring lately, but i'm workin on a way to get some stuff (music) published and put out to the peeps. may take awhile
Off to play some golf. A game I am truly mediocre at. No gambling today.
On a roll. Won four dart games in a row at Cat & Fiddle. No cash though. No one wants to gamble w/me.
Online tourney every Tuesday- hollywoodpoker.com (for those who care)  Come play. Playing now... then off to an old school haunt later.
Had some friends over. Played a lil card game called "screw your neighbor". Took all their money. Should I feel bad? I don't. VICTORY is ...
s American cash! All mine.
... and debating where to go on vacation to escape from ours for a second. Nah,  we'll bring her with. Maybe.
close friends just had a baby girl. At theirs giving useless advice. Congrats J & A.
so there's this crazy little event that occurs every summer called Comic-Con. apparently it's sold out. if u've got tix... C U there
Just about ready to start this shin-dig. Making it up as we go. Dont know what's gonna happen. Come along and be prepared for anything...
