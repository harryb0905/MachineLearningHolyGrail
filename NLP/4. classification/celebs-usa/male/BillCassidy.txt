@StephenHandwerk @KATCTV3 PFA: Regardless, all patients get a standard plan, HSA, drug coverage, no penalty. No action required.
@StephenHandwerk @KATCTV3 All auto-enrolled in coverage. Must ACTIVELY OPT OUT to not maintain. Only then subjected to enrollment penalty.
@StephenHandwerk @KATCTV3 Ballooning costs under #Obamacare will eventually collapse exchanges. We need a new system that will work. (3/3)
@StephenHandwerk @KATCTV3 The #Obamacare system is fundamentally flawed. (2/3)

You wouldn't agree to buy a car without knowing the price. Why would you with your health care? we need price transparency #wphealthcare
CT scans can cost $250-$2500 depending on where you go, but you have no way of knowing. Our plan creates price transparency #wphealthcare
Confident that @RepTomPrice will do a great job as HHS secretary to institute health care reform that works for patients. #wphealthcare
Congress should give Americans hope for a better vision of healthcare that will work for them. #wphealthcare
Obamacare has left 30 million uninsured. Republican alternative will insure more w/ better care. #wphealthcare
A fraction of Obamacare Medicaid funds actually reaches the patients. What a waste. #wphealthcare
Why should states, with massive premium increases be forced to keep #Obamacare , a system that is failing them? #wphealthcare
Republicans have said, "if you like your plan, you can keep it." We mean it #wphealthcare
Worked for 30 years in a hospital for the uninsured. These are my patients. Need a plan that gives them the power of choice. #wphealtchare
Obamacare forces Americans to pay more for benefits that they don't need. That needs to change. @wphealthcare

Good conversation and debate this morning. Lots of good thoughts and ideas shared about how to reform Medicaid. https://t.co/GJPt7h6pbC
Medicaid helps poorer individuals but right now money is not used efficiently-too much going to institutions, not to help patients #HCReform
#Medicaid has poor outcomes. Patients need provider accountability. #ProHC reform
We have to go past the anecdote and look at the data: patients only receive 20-40 cents of value for every $1 spent by the government #ProHC
Medicaid is the illusion of coverage without the power of access.
.@rebakahgeeMD agrees, Medicaid spends too much on institutions and not enough on patients
Expanding Medicaid and not seeing improvement in the service shows a problem with the program. Spending more money with no result #ProHC
Great turn out here with many more watching online. Let's talk about health care in this country. #ProHC reform https://t.co/udGc0EmYvY

Antonin Scalia was a leader, a protector of our constitutional rights. His influence will be missed. Our prayers are with his family.
A must read from @NOLAnews -President Obama shouldn't even think of taking money from our vanishing coast: https://t.co/IMqWbF1kux
Happy 207th birthday to President Abraham Lincoln, one of the finest men to ever serve our great nation.
@SOLouisiana @SpecialOlympics it was such an honor meeting Aaron, thank you.
ICYMI- Obama wants to take money away from LA- again. We've got to protect and increase revenue sharing. Read here: https://t.co/StX4ALTmAj
Happy Mardi Gras!
Will continue to fight against Obama's policies &amp; use my seat on Approps Cmte to block this. LA families, our economy must be protected.
The president is again attacking our oil and gas industry w/ his plan to put a $10 tax on every barrel of oil. This is unacceptable.
To my wife &amp; all women who have dedicated their lives to medicine- thank you. You are leaders. You are role models. You inspire us all.
I know first hand the impact women have had in the medical field. I'm so proud of my wife and her work to help breast cancer patients.
Today is National Women Physicians Day in honor of the bday of Elizabeth Blackwell- 1st woman to receive an MD from an American med school.

@thefccouncil Thanks for stopping by! Great seeing y'all.
Revenue sharing allows states to maintain and prepare for infrastructure demands of energy production &amp; help protects our natural resources.
Did you know a fourth of America's energy supply depends on the support facilities in South LA? With development comes costs to our state.
In LA, 100% of revenue from revenue sharing goes to coastal restoration projects--critical to LA survival and American energy security.
Energy-producing states deserve to share the revenue derived from energy developed both onshore and offshore.
.@SenBillNelson read the revenue sharing amendment. https://t.co/At5TH7SSzX
Big thanks to @lisamurkowski @DavidVitter @MarkWarner @timkaine @SenatorTimScott @ThomTillis for sponsoring revenue sharing amendment.
Amendment also establishes revenue sharing for VA, NC, SC, GA and AK.
By law, revenue sharing money goes toward coastal restoration in LA. Critical to protecting our coasts &amp; American energy infrastructure.
In FY2014 federal gov got $4.6 billion in royalties from Gulf oil production--coastal only received $3.4 million. Let's make this more fair.
Amendment provides greater equity in revenue sharing for states that host offshore energy production https://t.co/29ALsNbKSd

Why did Senate Democrats block a bill that would have suspended the admission of Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the US? (2/2)
If FBI Director Comey said, ‚ÄúMy concern there is there are certain gaps ... in the data available to us‚Äù in screening Syrian refugees. (1/2)
Join me in taking a moment to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Our nation is forever grateful for his extraordinary sacrifices.
I hope the president listens to the people of Louisiana today, and doesn't just speak.
You'll see families are struggling to pay their health care bills. They're concerned about radical Islam-POTUS won't even say radical Islam.
Talk to LA families today, Mr. President. You‚Äôll see your regulations are hurting our oil &amp; gas industry &amp; the jobs that come with it.
The president is trying to convince Louisiana families that it is opposite day, that his failed policies are working.
Joining @995WRNO to talk SOTU- listen in now.
We all agree w/ pres praise of Americans, identifying economic pressure on them. I hope the next 4 yrs will better address these issues.
Worst of all, patients on Medicaid still lack access to doctors. This is clearly a broken system‚ÄîLouisiana families better.
Data shows that patient‚Äôs health outcomes will still not improve and some patients will have worse outcomes than the uninsured.
The Urban Institute says that if Louisiana expands Medicaid, it will cost our state $120 million a year, on average, over the next 10 years.
Louisiana‚Äôs Medicaid expansion will follow the course it has in other states, costing taxpayers twice as much as originally proposed.
I‚Äôm a doctor, I‚Äôm all for covering people, but Medicaid is a broken system. When you have a broken system, expanding it doesn‚Äôt help.
Congratulations to Rep. Taylor Barras on becoming Louisiana House Speaker.
@UMCNO thanks for having me.
Obamacare's high costs &amp; mandates are hurting families. Thats why Congress voted to repeal Obamacare- no surprise POTUS vetoes repeal bill.

Heard in @EnergyGOP hearing: U.S. exporting crude oil is a clear win.
Read the data and see more here: https://t.co/G6NCB4HByE
This will result in tons less GHG emissions, more income for American workers, an increase in the US GDP and a focus on American priorities.
Bottom line, if crude oil export ban and American oil is exported, the demand for Iranian oil will decrease...
If Iran ups oil production by 2M barrels per day due to a vacuum US leaves in market, they will emit 100,000 metric tons more CO2e per day.
Rigs in the Gulf emit 0.031 &amp; 0.034 metric tons of CO2e per barrel-- Iranian oil fields emit 0.070 to 0.099 metric tons of CO2e per barrel.
Iran emits almost three times the GHG per barrel during production of crude oil than that of U.S. producers in the Gulf of Mexico.
...While pushing the Iran deal, Obama failed to mention that Iran does not share U.S. commitment to reducing emissions from oil production.
Obama has repeatedly made clear his belief that no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.
...while his Iran agreement allows Iran to increase their oil production by 2 million barrels per day &amp; gives access to new global markets.
Obama has attempted to lower GHG emissions by limiting domestic oil and gas production on federal lands &amp; implements crude oil export ban...

There's still time to get to the polls to vote for @DavidVitter for Governor. Read his message: https://t.co/p9sni81tCS
Today is the day to vote for Governor. Polls are open 7am-8pm. Join me in voting for @DavidVitter for Governor.
For these reasons and more- Louisiana needs @DavidVitter for Governor. I hope you join me in voting for him tomorrow.
We need a Gov who will protect Louisiana families by stopping Obama's Syrian refugee plan, not work with Obama to strengthen it.
We need a Gov who believes all children should have access to quality educations by supporting charter schools.
We need a Gov who will not only claim to be pro-life, but will advocate for policies that oppose abortion &amp; protect life at the state level.
As you head to the polls on Sat to vote for Governor, it's important to remember that there are stark differences between the candidates:
Who is going to pay for the increasing costs when more insurance companies back out of Ocare exchanges? Taxpayers. https://t.co/tVMV4yLpfi
