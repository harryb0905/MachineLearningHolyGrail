Frank Jr. was a great and loving family man. He will be missed dearly.
Last season, Frank Jr. sang the national anthem at Dodger Stadium on my birthday. What a voice! https://t.co/Nbeq3rXIBH
I am saddened to hear of the passing of Frank Sinatra Jr. Like his father, Frank Jr. brought us much joy w/ his unbelievable musical talent.
Nancy Reagan was a wonderful, sweet lady. I tell you, I really enjoyed being around her. https://t.co/HxdjHda1Ph https://t.co/Lr2tw96tpf
