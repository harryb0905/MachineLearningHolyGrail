Not the 1st time negotiations had a fix for DACA in exchange for A WALL.   Dems offered $25 Billion for border security in exchange for DACA. That could have included A WALL, as Dems promised $20 Billion in exchange for a path to citizenship for eligible immigrants.

Whew!  Okay, done venting. I‚Äôm better. We now resume our regularly scheduled tweets of  üí® jokes and pictures of ü•©s, üê∂s and üöòs.
‚ÄúIf the BuzzFeed report is right, then the President of the United States directed an underling to lie under oath -- which is, in and of itself, a crime.‚Äù #LockHimUp
#Base!!!!  If you still support Trump for who he is, try DOING AS HE DOES and see how it works out for you: STOP PAYING TAXES / BURN BRIDGES / BULLY EVERYONE / ONLY LIE / SUPPORT RACISM / DISRESPECT WOMEN / FIRE THOSE THAT QUESTION YOU / WORSHIP PUTIN / BLAME EVERYONE!  #Happy?
@michjohn48442 Not true. It‚Äôs coming.
No denying Trump is a piece of shit. But if these recent allegations/admissions from Michael Cohen don‚Äôt dissuade his brainwashed base, nothing will. Trump is THE most UN-American president in the history of our great country. #TraitorTrump #LockHimUp
@michjohn48442 Seriously? Look at the person you are standing up for. He is a bad human being. Really bad. And don‚Äôt attack anyone on my side without thinking about that. You‚Äôre better than that I would hope.

@FofStuf That is hilarious. Yes, I am shooting episode nine right now. And thank you for saying that
@cringle526 And by the way, I respect a sitting president that earns my respect. Donald Trump is a scumbag and deserves no respect from anyone because he gives no respect to anyone. He cares about one person and that‚Äôs himself.
@cringle526 We don‚Äôt live in a dictatorship. And it is the job of every single citizen to question when a rash or poor decision is made. Look at every single military mind and everyone in our government who is against this decision. This hurts our allies and helps our enemies.

@cringle526 Thanks for calling me a moron. I‚Äôm not saying we shouldn‚Äôt bring them home but at the right time. Almost all in the military think it‚Äôs too soon. That‚Äôs all.

@RKondratishin At all? You don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any validity in her statements that she was sexually assaulted? At all? Wow.
@KevinGillman Again, you are not dealing with my original statement. You are deflecting. Probably because you‚Äôre so ashamed of the person that you‚Äôre supporting. I am talking about the way Trump acts and how incredibly insensitive and cruel he is. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm talking about.
@KevinGillman Maybe you read a different question. I never mentioned Harvey Weinstein. I‚Äôm specifically asking how you can in anyway support such a disgusting sexist human being.

Forget the charges, the GOP is willing to confirm Kavanaugh to the highest court in the land for LIFE when he clearly lied about who he really was in high school/college. It‚Äôs despicable! He‚Äôs a liar. He‚Äôs a TERRIBLE choice. They don‚Äôt care!
@LDougdims @LindseyGrahamSC ... but he‚Äôs clearly hiding A LOT!

@SoapTweetsGH @cher Uh... yeah. You‚Äôll see.
#KavanaughHighlights so far. Kavanaugh is a great student, good athlete, hard worker, religious family man who also happens to have SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOL &amp; COLLEGE.
#Kavanagh won‚Äôt answer direct questions and instead goes through that laundry list of what a wonderful person he is and how hard he worked in school and what a great athlete he was.

@AMF6686 Good point. I thought about that too. But the way it‚Äôs portrayed in the movie is done in a very insensitive manner. Again, if it applied to any other disease or condition people would be outraged. As we should be.
@MouseLME It‚Äôs not the title. I know it looks like that from the Headline but that‚Äôs just what they call the character in the movie.

Throughout our history we‚Äôve sent men/women to war to fight the same type of autocratic, racist, evil monster we currently have occupying the WH. Think about THAT the next time you turn a blind eye and defend Trump with how well our economy is doing!
This drunk racist doctor is a piece of work!!!  Resist Arrest much?! https://t.co/86hXN2qeZp
FACT: A re-election campaign costs even more than a narcissistic military parade. So hopefully Trump is considering cancelling THAT too.
How can ANY true American support TRUMP?  He DOESN‚ÄôT believe in what America stands for... Freedom Of Speech, Respect, Equality &amp; Unity. He, and anyone who enables his autocratic bullshit is simply #UnAmerican!

@Nemo19089 Yes I am. I believe they fairly report the insanity Trump spews.
I personally believe when Trump supporters yell ‚ÄúCNN sucks!‚Äú they are actually yelling ‚ÄúThe TRUTH sucks!‚Äú because they can‚Äôt let themselves believe the madness/stupidity they are blindly following. LET‚ÄôS VOTE:
(CORRECTION) TRUMP: ‚Äú...it‚Äôs crazy, every time you go to the grocery store you‚Äôre asked to show your TAX RETURNS!‚Äù
I JUST did this exact thing on the subway last week. https://t.co/laFcnL9r3w

@TRUMPTEAM3 @StephMillerShow You are proving my point. None of what you just tweeted is true. None of it. But you just keep on believing your leader blindly.
@Iam28TNT @StephMillerShow That is 100% false. But you listen to Trump and believe him which is the problem. Trump is abusing ICE. They were never meant to be used in the way they are currently.
@GaryBurford12 @StephMillerShow You must be a robot my friend. Russian built no doubt.
@NicGreenDesign @evriley I‚Äôve never heard that but if you have then I can‚Äôt dispute what you have heard. But that is absolutely ridiculous. Nobody in their right mind wants a wide open border.

@evriley How IS that a sign of wanting open borders? Just because you‚Äôre cult leader tells you it is? Just because he lies to you? You‚Äôre smarter than that. Don‚Äôt believe a word he says. He lies about everything. Everything!
Why is Trump allowed to get away with saying ‚ÄúDemocrats want open borders‚Äú? COMPLETE LIE!  And why isn‚Äôt this lie as well as everything else he lies about convincing his base to stop following him like they‚Äôre in a cult?! #WakeUp

Trump is so transparent and juvenile on every level. He really reminds me of a 10-year-old. And an immature 10-year-old at that. Bashing Jeff Sessions so he will  resign. He can‚Äôt fire the man without looking like he is obstructing justice.

@billrantz Let me know.
Why is TRUMP freaking out?  HIS appointed team ordered these raids today. He said himself, he knew nothing about what his crooked fixer did for him. No knowledge of the $130K hush slush at all. Why‚Äôs HE freaking out?  Unless... bum Bum BUUUUUUM!!!  #WakeUpBase
@_MrNeeds Oh yeah. I‚Äôve waited until the 10th anniversary to come out. Gonna be fun.
@SPN_Nicola Always.
@thedudemikemay Thanks Mikey. And thanks for letting me borrow your fat suit.

@Jillbles Nope
I found the tie-dye dog you were looking for. https://t.co/eAX2QvVHbQ
@Adlee7873 Seems to me Scott must have been joking about that.
@shipleylr @CathySheffler The self-restraint that I am currently fighting... if you only knew the comments I want to send back to you guys.
@shipleylr @NittanyNC Too many poppies. Now your comments are making sense.
@shipleylr @Daminals76 Of course I was.
@Radatatin Thanks so much.
@lindsellen Okay very cool.
@ellegirlnyc Thanks so much.
@JosephJBouman I think you‚Äôre thinking of Joe and not Jerry.
@HForHershey So frightening as a parent.
@ScottPaterno You would know better for sure. But the news reports I‚Äôve seen it seems real Jerry was just as creepy as the one portrayed in our film. But as https://t.co/EkVQh3KoL7 shows these monsters can be anyone. Scary.
That‚Äôs actually not the way he is portrayed in the movie at all. As a matter of fact, Pacino states how ‚ÄúJerry was honored by the POTUS... experts were fooled by this man‚Äù.  Everyone should read this report on spotting a predator. https://t.co/cHuiReNODW
@ScottPaterno Absolutely.
@shipleylr @thejonsteinshow Gimme a break.
@bapudliner @RobStennet @PSlock @HBO And yet it continue to happen to so many more innocent children over years and years. Forget whether Joe could‚Äôve done more... which of course he could have! So many others guilty of letting it continue. THAT‚ÄôS what the Paterno Family is trying to educate us ALL about.
@tripill @HBO Thank you.
@bapudliner @HBO Because that wasn‚Äôt in my dialogue. I‚Äôm an ACTOR!
@AndyMilder @HBO You‚Äôre too thin.
@shipleylr @HBO And her Pulitzer Prize?
@ronraymond Bingo!
@JamieJmessina Cyber bully... perfect timing.
@alijacobs200 Exactly.
@DefendAChild @ChiTownLionPSU I disagree. People are talking about how important it is to say something if you see something. So that‚Äôs a huge win in the fight to protect our kids.
@sonsofsidg I really appreciate that.
@artdecider üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
@galahad_progeny Good point.
@clarksdailys Thank you so much. Appreciate that.
@CathySheffler It happened. And we need to take away from this film that we ALL need to say something when we see something. Attacking others does nothing.
@TFanella @NPR @HBO Pulitzer Prize winner Sarah Ganim you mean?
@_jenngonzalez Thank you. Appreciate that.
@ebrown2112 Thanks man.
@Kel_Pac It was the highlight of my career. A master class. He was generous and warm and amazing.
@CathySheffler @Jcorbs63 Not true.
@princess_sized_ Barry Levinson is a genius.
@allkenz27 Thank you.
@NJSS56 Thank you.
@SpudCouch1 Thank you so much.
@beachwineguy What are you talking about?  Did we just see the same film?
@AndyMilder You are the greatest!  Thanks pal.
@ebrown2112 Thanks.
#PaternoHBO ‚Äî Let me know your thoughts after you‚Äôve seen it. Thanks.
@chrizly72 It‚Äôs just so shocking!
@shipleylr @HBO See the movie before throwing stones.
Did the #POTUS just tweet about how well his building did in the fire today WITHOUT addressing the LOSS OF LIFE that resulted in it?  A HUMAN BEING DIED IN YOUR TOWER ASSHOLE!  HIS ignorant selfish evil is MIND BLOWING!
‚ÄòPATERNO‚Äô on NOW on East Coast on @HBO
@benbell93 You bring up great points and exactly why I think this film needed to be made.
@jfsemmer All of your questions are valid and would apply to a movie called ‚ÄòSandusky‚Äô. Our film is called ‚ÄòPaterno‚Äô. You should see it.
@AHeroIsHere Thanks for the follow. Means a lot to me.
@joeyg49 @bluesal89 That is just absolutely 100% incorrect. See the movie before you make these crazy accusations.  Come on!
@wensilver @bpd115 @ChiTownLionPSU Why was the reporter that broke the story involved? Is that a serious question? And Barry Levinson did the exact opposite of what you‚Äôre claiming. See the film.
@psunumber1 @klkpsu86 @ChiTownLionPSU Great point.
@Berkland4 @emtfr @sdgarguilo By believing and fully responding to the terrible reports from children. That‚Äôs how.
@bapudliner @ScottPaterno @ChiTownLionPSU When you haven‚Äôt even seen the film.
@PBlite29 Please watch the film before you attack. All the facts are brought up in the film. You‚Äôll see when you see it.
@JmmyW Yes. That scene is captured. And so is that same feeling of using JoPa as a scapegoat. All of it. You‚Äôll see in a couple of hours. It‚Äôs a powerful film IMO.
@PSUProud1 That‚Äôs a great point.
@markhentz @jarradjames12 Incredible.
@capkbc It does. You‚Äôll see when you watch it.
@bluesal89 I read as much as I could on line as well as following Scott on Twitter. I learned about how smart and caring he is and how much the family truly cares about child safety and have devoted themselves to providing the resources for all of us at https://t.co/EkVQh3KoL7
@markhentz That‚Äôs really not a question for me. I‚Äôm actor in the film. You should see it.
@EllsBellsInPA You‚Äôve already seen the film? How did that happen? See the film first before attacking me.
@SeanitoPK First of all, congrats on writing a graphic novel. Submit it to all of the publishers that you can. That‚Äôs how I did it.
@PBlite29 That‚Äôs funny.
@hmciv You‚Äôll see.
@PSUProud1 See the film. I‚Äôm an actor in the film. That‚Äôs it. I hope people take away from this film the fact that we have to say something if we see something. All of us. Not just those at the top.
@hmciv You‚Äôll see when you see the film.
@HForHershey Please refer all questions on the actual making of the film and the research done to the filmmakers. I‚Äôm an actor in the film and incredibly proud of it. See the film before attacking. Please.
@klkpsu86 @ChiTownLionPSU Are you fucking kidding me? First of all, I am incredibly proud to be in this movie. Work with these amazing people. Hardly a misstep to continue the conversation about speaking up and protecting children.
@bpd115 @wensilver @ChiTownLionPSU I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚ÄúAsk me anything‚Äù. My fault. I‚Äôm an actor in the film. You have questions about the making of the film?  Bring it on.
@emtfr @sdgarguilo Why are you attacking ME?  Sandusky is the devil. GOT IT!  Are you defending how the university handled this monster?
@emtfr @Arturo14495276 Known LIES?  Children were molested. Lives were ruined!  MANY people didn‚Äôt do enough. Turned a blind eye!  This must change.
@capkbc @Arturo14495276 See the film. Not fictional.
@emtfr Wow. See the film first. Then you can attack me.
@JSpangs44 @emtfr @bpd115 See the film first.
@PGQue @bpd115 See the film THEN comment.
@bpd115 See the film.
@emtfr @bpd115 I disagree. See the film.
@ClareKramer @NBCThisisUs @c2e2 @MiloVentimiglia @justinhartley Ask Milo if he‚Äôs going to watch ME in ‚ÄúPaterno‚Äù tonight on HBO at 8pm.

'PATERNO' REVIEW from @npr https://t.co/nGPKHTTZgn #PaternoHBO @HBO
THIS song?  I like it.  https://t.co/oESztUzn1p
@jarradjames12 And the camera?
@AHeroIsHere Greatest: Company Man. Lowest: Heroes Reborn
@bpd115 It‚Äôs not irresponsible storytelling.
@andmichaelgreen I suggest:  PATERNO on @HBO &amp; A Quiet Place in theaters.
@thejonsteinshow I did not. I probably should have.
@dresswhisperer @HBO Awesome. Hope you enjoy it.
@Spencer2671 Thanks so much.
@jarradjames12 Wow!  Fill me in. I have no idea.
@sdgarguilo Unfortunately not. I would love to one day.
@just_the_same Dream Jumper Book 2
@Arturo14495276 His professionalism and willingness to try interesting things. He‚Äôs the GOAT!
@ScottPaterno @ChiTownLionPSU Understandable.
@ScottPaterno I‚Äôd love to know your real thoughts after seeing the film tomorrow night.
@ScottPaterno Inquiring minds...
