@lanceallan And that is why the entire @packers coaching staff must go.  Team team is completely lost.
Did an Interview with ABC 5 here in the Twin Cities to try and get some support from the state for needed upgrades to our oval.   https://t.co/313duvMEed
Something seems fishy about this entire thing. #nfl @packers https://t.co/xWUFNhABaw
@lanceallan @packers @Vikings @tmj4 I‚Äôll see you at the game!!! Go Pack Go!
@lanceallan Horrible play calling.

Great message... https://t.co/QSqcNCzSuW
@lanceallan @garydamatogolf @Wisdotgolf @RobHernandezGLF Congrats @garydamatogolf !
@dpshow Hell no!  Two athletes past their prime who won't let go.  If they were doing an event like this for charity I would definitely tune in.  Neither of these individuals needs another $10 million.

https://t.co/NSEiJSga1Q  Got a chance to work with Carl on Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in 2012.  Sad to hear of his passing.  One of the great recognizable voices in show biz.
@garydamatogolf @journalsentinel Bucks need to bench Bledsoe as well as Snell at this point.  Time to give Brogdon and Parker a chance with starting lineup to see if they are in the Bucks future.  Hard to watch this team right now.
I know it‚Äôs only game 5, of 162, but still super exciting. https://t.co/LuEADAHgpY

@lanceallan @e_vansmack But it‚Äôs not over yet!!!!!!
@lanceallan @e_vansmack It is heartbreaking.  I feel for the athletes.
@lanceallan @e_vansmack I tell you what @lanceallan.  There are definitely some changes that need to be made, but this team can‚Äôt catch a break.  Injury, illness, etc.  Still, give them .5 second and they have 3+ medals and this conversation is completely different
@BrittanyBowe Keep your head up Bbowe.  The adversity you have faced over the last 2 years is second to none.  We all know your ability and what you are capable of.
