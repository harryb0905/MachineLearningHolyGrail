@garlin @MalloryMcMorrow @NotreDame See, that’s the kind of magnanimity I like seeing from a #MichiganMan. @JordanAckerMI, you can learn a lot from @garlin!
At the “Top of the Mark” at the @InterConHotels Mark Hopkins in SF listening to a wannabe tech bro trying to hit on a woman by claiming he’s building an “Instagram competitor on top of Instagram” and that he “used to be an iOS developer for a while.” Ugh. Run away!
I’m a former @AIPAC intern and a Democrat. The @nytimes Daily podcast narrative that a couple instances of uninformed tweets means the Democratic Party has a problem with anti-Semitism is false.
@sanuzis You mean when he was advocating for service to the United States in what he called the “New Frontier” in that speech — in a group that he would soon call the “Peace Corps”?
One way to make sure the "clarification" gets the same "volume" as the original tweet is adding it back into the feed of anyone who engaged with the original. https://t.co/R27uOHCWTv

@LisaDNews Trump could show up when the House is in session and ask to be recognized. Then Pelosi would be in the position to either recognize him, ignore him or gavel out of session and turn the lights out. Hard to believe that this would happen however.
@SuperBentendo @mr_patrickallan Or late Gen X.
@IlhanMN @bariweiss Kudos to you for acknowledging the lack of understanding of the context and responding directly.
@bugeye15 @mrlevine I meant Chevrolet and GMC. Each have different features, customers and marketing. I assume just like Ford and Lincoln. For example, Lincoln has Matthew McConaughey. Also, although you can get power running boards on an F-150, they aren’t illuminated.
@oaklandroads @TroyMI_Police Good luck and stay safe! (Cc: @MDOT_MetroDet)

But yes, didn’t know the ad data until I moved to the publisher role.
@jowens510 @majoranabreak @danahull @business Sure, but we popularized the “big board” idea. Every Gawker employee had access to our data — even when we got up to 150 employees.
@jowens510 @majoranabreak @danahull @business I was a reporter there first and I had access then.
@jowens510 @majoranabreak @danahull @business I knew that type of information at Gawker. I think all reporters should have a better understanding of how readers read their work.

@AlexRoy144 @united Get rewarded everywhere you go.
Excited to hear from @garlin this morning at @MalloryMcMorrow’s new legislator training.
Response from Harvey Santana: “you look about my size, I’ve got all sorts of flashy clothes for you to wear!”
I have a question for the panel: “how can I maximize floor privileges to most embarrass my wife, @MalloryMcMorrow?”
@MalloryMcMorrow @lpackard Already do that!
Harvey Santana: “do not go up to Mackinac without your spouse. I don’t know what they put in the water up there but... just don’t do it.”
@MalloryMcMorrow: “don’t get any ideas...”
Raschelle Hauck: “I have no rules for @RogerWHauck. I let him run amuck.”
The Santanas say they’ve almost divorced “so many times.” GREAT. SUPER EXCITED.
@MickiMaynard @MalloryMcMorrow Oh, in total now? At least 8 female Democratic Senators (of 16) now — I think most have spouses.
Somehow my response will be more like “Get your ass to Lansing, @MalloryMcMorrow!”
On attacks, Raschelle Hauck says “focus on business as usual” and “stay grounded in myself” so that when her husband is home “ahhh, he’s just home!”
@MickiMaynard @MalloryMcMorrow At least a handful.
@SenatorSantana has had protestors show up at their house during challenging votes. Glad we’ve got our scary security dog. https://t.co/1PUsIw2bHS
Raschelle Hauck removed herself from social media to handle the critics. @RepFarrington agreed. Yeah... guess that’s not going to happen for me.
@lpackard @MalloryMcMorrow Maybe both?
https://t.co/5JtYRvnwuS
I hope I learn how to do things like keep dinner warm for @MalloryMcMorrow when votes run late.
The panel? @RepFarrington, @SenatorSantana and Raschelle Hauck, wife of @RogerWHauck.
At a new legislator orientation with @MalloryMcMorrow. Stay tuned for my live-tweeting of the next session: “Advice for Legislative Spouses” https://t.co/GLMXxu7JHV

@jonfavs @MalloryMcMorrow Now we need to leverage what we learned — starting with asking the voters what’s important to them, and using that as our starting point to win in 2020 and beyond.
@jonfavs As someone who worked for the last Democrat to win the Governor’s office in Michigan, and whose wife, @MalloryMcMorrow, ran for State Senate this cycle, I’ve never seen a top of the ticket so focused on working to win races down the ticket. Amazing leadership.

So proud of @MalloryMcMorrow for being endorsed by the @Freep, Michigan’s largest newspaper, in her run for Michigan State Senate — one day after the @detroitnews said she was “running a strong campaign!”

@tomshea It really kicked the llama’s ass.
@mbsimon @joshtpm Does she though?
@joshtpm And she’s hanging out with him because I honestly don’t think she understood anything about what this guy stands for.
@joshtpm Campaign events. Apparently there was an event with Mark Meadows that he showed up at last week.
@JordanAckerMI @joshtpm Josh — talk to Jordan. Trust us. It’s worth it.
@joshtpm It was a Lena Epstein for Congress event. They handled the logistics, paid for it and set the run of show. Jacobs has apparently been at Epstein events recently. Last, his “synagogue” is down the street from Beth El, the Temple both Lena and I belong to. Her team invited him.
@duckduckF It was a Lena Epstein for Congress rally. They put it together. This was all Lena and her staff.
@joshtpm She also said in her own statement that she invited the prayer.
@joshtpm Also, I know Lena very well. This is absolutely the type of idiotic thing she would do.
@joshtpm https://t.co/3P5DHc923W
@joshtpm Nope, it was definitely Epstein and her campaign that invited the fake rabbi.

@JGreenbergSez @LenaEpstein @VP I have it on good authority the staffer’s name is “Shlena Shlepstein.”
Lena Epstein invited a “fake rabbi” to a rally with the Vice President and Mike Bishop to give a blessing over just Republican candidates, and she’s calling that “an effort of unity?” I don’t think she knows what the word “unity” means. https://t.co/wq6QorPS1I
@rafaelshimunov *invited
@rafaelshimunov The worst part is the person who incited the fake rabbi was Lena Epstein... she’s Jewish!
Now the VP’s Press Secretary has joined her boss in tossing Lena Epstein under the bus over her inviting a fake rabbi to her rally with Mike Bishop and Pence: https://t.co/VGBTSLf6sw

@jonathanoosting Because he was already doing so well with married suburban women.
@jonathanoosting https://t.co/qu2GMHNYXg
The weird thing is Granholm still polls well in Michigan. #MIGovDebate
This might have been Schuette’s “Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer” moment. That didn’t work well for Dick Posthumus. Ask his daughter, Lisa. #MIGovDebate

So proud of @MalloryMcMorrow for staying focused on the issues that matter to the residents of Oakland County — our water, our roads and children’s education — and not trivial, silly and sexist attacks from career politicians. https://t.co/oORbVgJpBB
Hey @amyrchapman, is this one of the PACs you’re fundraising for? If not, I still kind of want to donate to it — I don’t even care who they’re supporting. Well, unless it’s Ted Cruz. https://t.co/M5H4ip3PXj
@baseballot @FiveThirtyEight Michigan senate shouldn’t see a shift to R due to fundraising. Quarterly number doesn’t take into account the equal level of cash on hand or the $4 million already pre-spent on ad units by Stabenow for final two weeks. Jacobs still just trying to catch up.
@TVietor08 Also, for anyone who wants it, here’s a link to help donate to flip both houses in a state — all the targeted Michigan state legislative races: https://t.co/L015f3qwDU (h/t to @charles_gaba)

@john__rosevear @timkhiggins @marycmccormack @chevrolet No burn. The @GM advanced tech Comms team are just big West Wing fans and want to make sure @marycmccormack has some dependable all-electric 238 mile-per-charge transportation.
@timkhiggins In the interim, we’ve offered to loan @marycmccormack a @chevrolet Bolt EV so she has a more dependable electric vehicle to drive.

@MikeIsaac Yeah — which is why I’d label them as a “potential” challenger. TBH, I’d expect all - FB, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon - to continue challenging each other’s core businesses as they try to maximize their own opportunities.

@darrenrovell @tischphotos @ChrisVannini Let's ask @micahcohen and @FiveThirtyEight. I think they might disagree.
@tischphotos @ChrisVannini @darrenrovell So, sure -- it's a poll. Is it any way scientific or relevant? Not likely.
@tischphotos @ChrisVannini Is it technically a measure of votes? Yes. Is this an actual measurement of "people" who believe something, as @darrenrovell says? No.
@_DanielJThomas_ Thanks -- screwed that one up. Fixed now! :-)

@ChrisVannini I always accept Twitter polls as a valid form of polling.
@pbump Right after saying Trump "can say whatever he wants." I'm confused... what's it called when only the leader has the right to free speech?
@emilymbadger So... the President can "use whatever language he wants to use," but NFL players need to "do free speech on their own time?"

If cutting government spending was the Tea Party big story, what was the #WomensMarch big story?
@Aerocles oh, trust me, I know/
@wittinmyhair @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump the point isn't which is bigger, point is even with 4x audience, Obama still needed media.
@Aerocles @seanspicer @ajt someone should... I have my own analysis I'd be happy to share.
@Aerocles @SeanSpicer also, remember, @BarackObama had 4x the followers of Trump. He still needed media.
@Aerocles @seanspicer only .02% of his followers click Twitter links and tweets only seen by ~1.3%. He needs media beyond right for reach.

@jlgolson how many miles does it get on all-electric? Over or under 200?

I heard Trump's Secret Service nickname will be "Chester."
@alieward @CBSInnovationTV I'm only slightly very scared of bugs, so this is, like, revolutionary and stuff.

You would think given Trump's love for @McDonalds that $MCD would be up more today.
Well, Republicans wanted the power. Now they'll have it -- along with the accountability that comes with it. #ElectionNight
@jlgolson https://t.co/L2nXWqaEmE
If PA and MI go to Clinton, Wisconsin goes Trump, and Clinton holds on to Nevada, we may go to 269-269. This is insanity. #ElectionNight

Hey, @RJ4MI, your website is down on election day. Not a good time for that to happen.
Wolf, please stop yelling in John King's face every time a precinct in Florida updates.
Broward County FL results just updated: https://t.co/Aia6y0V7zF #ElectionNight
Florida polls about to close... now. #ElectionNight
750K votes in 2012 in Broward County, FL. Obama won 2-to-1. With 1 hour to go, Broward has 12% higher turnout than 2012. #ElectionNight
Any reports of Oakland County, MI precincts with long lines that I can bring pizza to?
I don't know why @MSNBC is saying first polls close at 7. The first polls closed at 6 in most of Indiana and the eastern half of Kentucky.
If you're paying attention to precinct turnout data and the demographic of that turnout, you're not believing  "Trump is close in MI."
This will be huge news for Clinton in FL. Broward breaks 2-to-1 Dem. #ElectionDay https://t.co/6E65qekgcl
Remember, there are just 1,456 days until Election Day 2020. #ElectionDay
@amyrchapman @Jeff_Daniels looks like he's in Santa Fe... 🙁
Screw exit polls. I only care about turnout in benchmark precincts. #ElectionDay
Just saw 2 PM turnout #s for key R, D and I precincts in MI's Oakland County. Turnout is sig. higher than 2012. #ElectionDay
@FrankLuntz my seven Oakland County Ind. benchmark precinct 2 PM turnout #s are 9% higher than 2008, 22% higher than 2012.

MI Oakland County Royal Oak Precinct 6 is a reliable bellweather for independent turnout. Record 808 votes cast by noon. #ElectionDay
I feel like Stauffer's missed an easy opportunity to sell "donkeys and elephants" animal crackers on #ElectionDay.
Great to see @AndyMeisner while walking over to my precinct to vote to reelect him for Oakland County Treasurer! #ElectionDay
Trump finally made it to his polling place at 10:56 AM -- literally the worst time for TV viewership.

"Such a nasty woman" is not how you endear yourself to women, Donald. #Debate #debatenight
@zachmaster426 Not saying it wasn't legal. I am saying that it's not "we," as in the Trump Organization, Inc., it was "him" as in Donald.
Melania was right, Donald is a boy, not a man. #debate #DebateNight
And with that comment, Trump just called into question the foundation of our democracy. #Debate #DebateNight

@metarzn @jowyang precisely. What happened to building "EVs for Everyone?"
@johndstoll there'll be more than enough time for them to learn about the benefits of the Bolt EV in the next two years they'll be waiting.
@johndstoll I'm not. I just know the Bolt EV team is pretty busy getting ready to build some cars. 😉
@johndstoll @mashable I'm sure we can arrange something soon. Email Michelle / Kevin and cc me.
@johndstoll @mashable but I'm sure we can arrange a passenger seat ride for you in a Bolt EV sometime soon.
@johndstoll @mashable you can DRIVE a Bolt EV after you DRIVE a Model 3. 😉

@kosmokenny @Ballaban I don't think that's it.
@Ballaban I don't know. The ICE infrastructure - gas stations - were built by other companies. That might be why.
@Ballaban I believe other automakers have offered to build adapters to use their network. Tesla won't allow it.
@Ballaban One minor issue. Have you asked Tesla why they don't allow other automakers to use their network?

@xoxoCox @Curbed @LangeAlexandra @GM @gmrencen Yes, it was @Ford before they completed their great white flight, consolidating in Dearborn
@xoxoCox @Curbed @LangeAlexandra Except @GM moved its HQ to the @gmrencen in 1996, not 1977.
@danbedore @chevrolet @NissanUSA I meant AC/DC (or the rights holder) was lame for selling the song to two automakers in one year.
Didn't @chevrolet just use "Back in Black" in ads and now @NissanUSA is using it? Lame.
