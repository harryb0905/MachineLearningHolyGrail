New vlog is up! Check it out! 👍🏼  https://t.co/7MZsgxX8qf https://t.co/gW1xxSGnkz
@MotoAmerica1 will be on @FOXSports with 90 minutes of live or same-day coverage on both Saturday and Sunday from all 10 rounds of the 2019 series! This is HUGE news! Please spread the word by giving this a RT.   https://t.co/IzwZ1vdTEI https://t.co/MNDtIWJ9Kq
@xracer264 You’re welcome. Happy new year!
@ebbtide113 Thank you. Happy New Year! 🎆
@GaryJoh99596196 Thank you and Happy New Year!
If you’re splitting lanes DO NOT sit between cars. Don’t hesitate. Just go. Be safe. Happy New Year!

LETS GOOOOO! It’s my time! Click the link to watch the video announcement! @YoshimuraUSA @suzukicycles   https://t.co/yKpNoNBJyD https://t.co/6NUPng9njO
@WorldSBK is back at Laguna Seca with @MotoAmerica1 on July 12-14! You’re not going to want to miss this event. Mark your calendars. https://t.co/G2JaN6xTo4
@dyessman03 @MotoAmerica1 Probably to allow some late bloomers the chance to race the 300’s at an older age.
@JohnnyStetz @MotoAmerica1 It does get old watching someone win. I agree with that. But if I was a kid I would rather race against the best.
@T__Eazy @MotoAmerica1 Totally agree!
@eschelzig @MotoAmerica1 They do. I don’t agree with the age restriction though. Does the NBA make a 30 year old go home because he has too much experience to play against 19 year old rookies?
The age limit for the @MotoAmerica1 Junior Cup class has been raised from 14-25 to 14-28. What are your thoughts? I don’t think there should be an age limit in a professional series. MotoAmerica is for the top riders in the country. Why restrict the age?

Stunt life bro! https://t.co/6KnbdFh0EX
Please RT if Twitter is your main source for motorcycle information and you’d like to see me post more.
It’s pretty sad that the commentators apologize 10 times for riders cussing after a race. Let them be real people for gods sake. Quit taking away their personalities.
@reformedfabian 😂😂😂
@smaritz21 I didn’t get pulled over. All good. Lol
@Raymond51758 He didn’t even pull me over. Lol
@xracer264 I was in my truck doing 40 mph. Thanks though Dad.
I just accidentally drag raced a cop in an unmarked car from a light to the freeway on ramp. I lost.
@TyvanHooydonk @CycleGear 💯
@gotpurpledrank That has to get old telling people every day. They should put a sign up on the front of the store. NOT A BICYCLE STORE! Lol
@johnhughes_225 @gregwhite Thanks man! Hopefully you were able to watch a race in person. Here is the sfhedule for 2019 if you haven’t seen it already.   https://t.co/19bRxaFBsv
Earlier this week, I went to a Cycle Gear and as I opened the door I heard @gregwhite’s voice announcing a MotoAmerica race, “And Josh Herrin wins by 37 seconds!” The guy behind the counter looked up and we locked eyes. It was the most random things that has ever happened to me!
How many people go to Cycle Gear thinking it’s a bicycle store? 🤔

@CW1Miles @jacksonlackmon_ @WFMY @KTMUSA @MotoAmerica1 Link isn't working
@AdamRoberts3 No doubt. Their sponsors got their money's worth the past two weekends alone. Haha
@killroy26 I'm not sure what happened there. Have you ever seen Pedrosa's loop out?
@ThomasLUTHI Good job! 👍🏼
@doxom85 I think Morbidelli will go to Marc VDS and replace Rabat if he doesn't get some good results this year.
@AdamRoberts3 Big time! What was their best result last year in the dry?
Turn on @MAVTV right now to watch @cameronbeaubier on the @DaveDespain Show. @MotoAmerica1 👍🏼
@SuperLex26 Good job Alexis! 👍🏼
You're so sexy @LarryPegram72! @beINSPORTSUSA needs to get some wigs in the studio! 😂  Good job man. I agree with your #MV25 prediction. https://t.co/GMWabbyX39
@bikewaffle I love Nakagami. That guy can string laps together in testing like I've never seen. I hope he puts together a solid season this year.
@JohnnyStetz @maverickmack25 @ValeYellow46 That was good to hear him admit that he maybe made a mistake. Kind of weird that him and Pedrosa fell in the same spot.
@rickhimself101 I don't see him leaving Tech 3 for anything besides a factory seat if he is getting good results like he is.
@bikewaffle I see the marketing side of it but I hope someone gets it that deserves it. Who knows. Maybe Pedrosa will keep re signing. Haha
@rickhimself101 That's what I was thinking but I would think a VR46 rider would get that spot.
@bikewaffle I hope not. He doesn't deserve it.
Zarco is so impressive! He needs pedrosas ride.
Let's go @maverickmack25!!!!
Turn on @beINSPORTSUSA right now to watch Moto3, Moto2 &amp; @MotoGP. Hey @TerriLeighTV! @LarryPegram72 is no Josh Herrin is he? 😂 #justkidding https://t.co/oXGA17ZL2k
