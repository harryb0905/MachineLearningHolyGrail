Not saying any fault. MM commits to turn, leans in. MM's head (&amp; maybe more) connect with Rossi's leg. Rossi feels impact, his body reacts.
Marquez headbutts Rossi's knee. Rossi's leg movement is a reaction to an impact. MM's shoulder/arm probably hit Rossi's calf/ankle/foot too.
Marquez leaned into Rossi's knee, head first. Marquez then lost the front, taking pressure from Rossi's knee, causing his leg to come out.

Today surfing unites bravado and supreme apathy. New island shores harbour internal tides amongst nuanced inlets.
Everything is simple.  Usury is wrong. So is theft.  Love and forgiveness are right.  Forgive the bankers... and steal from them.
Recognizing weakness is not a strength. It's a responsibility.
Somethings I'm proud of.  But I'm most proud of what I haven't done.
You have a second chance. A third. A fourth. Even a fifth. And more.  But just for you.  You'll never get her back, and that's for the best.
Fucking up is human. Fucking you is wrong.*  *New Year Revelations From the Past.**  **we all have ghosts in the closet.
Why do other religions also take days off over Christmas?  Because denial is exhausting.
Why do you think you are stupid?   You are wrong.
The birth of the father of forgiveness and a new year are close for a reason. Forgive yourself and move forward as a new you. Love U ALL!!!
Melted cheese is the king of foods.

The #RipcurlSearch. Where Rip Curl is searching for money to hold an event and locals happy to see them. #DONTHOLDYOURBREATH
Live surfing except for ads, interviews, recaps, replays, warmups, showering, changing, wives, dogs, crowd and lifestyle shots. #ASPYEW
The ASP has banned everyone from watching the Portugal event. Spent all their money on the new logo.
@ripcurl_usa @nachogil3 @moche @RipCurlPro not webcast team. You have free hosting with youtube. You're in Portugal. How do you fuck it up?
Someone give Knox a Red Bull. Or let him have a nap.
