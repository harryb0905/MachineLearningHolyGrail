@The_RollinChef I like flank it flap steak for this - you could also sub any protein you want like chicken, shrimp, etc...
Set out extra chips, toppings &amp; plates so guests can make their own &amp; you can watch the game. Recipe https://t.co/dPKJrdOZfU #EmerilsGameDay
Serve the nachos immediately and enjoy! #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/ORxWOrwYJS
If you feel like kicking it up, melt the cheese with a blow torch! Your friends will be impressed...#EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/xevou8mpNc
After assembling layers, broil the nachos for 2-3 mins ‚Äì just long enough to melt the cheese. #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/f2fryPyoLn
Remember that you can add any toppings you want &amp; as much as you want, so if you want more steak, go for it. #EmerilsGameDay
Add steak to nachos in layers. This recipe calls for three layers of chips, beans, steak &amp; cheese. #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/HObFNEwsMV
Once the steak has rested, slice it very thin across the grain &amp; cut into bite size pieces. #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/958cCNErk3
Begin layering the nachos with chips on the bottom, following with some of the beans &amp; cheese. #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/AePy7AL9X6
Season the steak with salt &amp; grill for 4 mins per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter &amp; let it rest for 5-7 mins. #EmerilsGameDay
Chop lettuce and grate the cheeses so that you are ready to start layering when the steak and beans are ready to go! #EmerilsGameDay
Start making beans &amp; while they‚Äôre simmering, begin assembling all of the garnishes. #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/H2GcZAljWB
Preheat oven, rub steak with my Southwest Seasoning or other rub, set aside at room temp for 1 hr #EmerilsGameDay https://t.co/aYqz0TnTkK

Bake the oysters until the sauce turns brown on top - about 20 mins. #EmerilsHoliday https://t.co/bracyc1LrT
Remove from heat &amp; beat in egg yolks. Make sure to remove from the heat first. Otherwise, you will scramble your eggs. #EmerilsHoliday
Next up, add lemon juice, green onions &amp; parsley and stir to mix well. #EmerilsHoliday https://t.co/rCsLQxYN3e
Add milk &amp; wine &amp; reduce heat. Then fold in mushrooms &amp; shrimp &amp; cook until the sauce is thick. #EmerilsHoliday https://t.co/JDjNo6n6qe

Now, it‚Äôs time to make the sauce. You can use it immediately or reserve for later closer to when guests are arriving. #EmerilsHoliday
Place oysters on a sheet pan on rock salt. The salt keeps the oysters in place. Preheat oven to 400. #EmerilsHoliday https://t.co/P0AGDP0r3G

Hey Steve, I know my kids love pasta. It's a good way to work in some veg too. #AskEmeril  https://t.co/2dY8IT2hdx
For a gumbo, it's all about the roux. You have to have a good roux for a good gumbo. #AskEmeril  https://t.co/wwkr73kraM
I do. If people are paying attention to the soup, then you know they're paying attn to other things too. #AskEmeril  https://t.co/dMFzUqs0Ee
I love a shrimp boil or stuffed shrimp. Most of the time, I saute them though. They are so versatile. #AskEmeril  https://t.co/PY0Dq7MS9M
