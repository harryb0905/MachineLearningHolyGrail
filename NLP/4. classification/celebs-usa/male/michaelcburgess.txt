The value of work is an important tenet of the American story. I joined @RepKevinHern to send a letter to @SecretarySonny supporting stronger work requirements for #SNAP benefits because it’s critical for Congress to encourage families to succeed. https://t.co/amSatuNlSC
ICYMI: While Democrats are busy using @HHSgov ORR shelters as political props, I’m working to ensure that unaccompanied minors who cross our border are safe. https://t.co/wcogjM6Nar
Last week at @EnergyCommerce, @gracemarietweet presented an excellent case for greater health care freedom that gives Americans the right to choose coverage that works for them. Read more in @Forbes: https://t.co/HR23H8vPV4
It was great to catch up with @GovAbbott this week in Austin as we collaborate on ways to serve Texans, including our work to extend our state's @CMSGov #1115Waiver to protect Texas patients' access to quality care. https://t.co/dygH1G3tt4
It’s unfortunate that @HouseDemocrats continue to put their political agenda ahead of the truth. No one should be surprised that they are making headlines by mischaracterizing a shelter providing critical &amp; compassionate care to vulnerable kids. https://t.co/T9ZHkr11l8
Thanks to Lt. Gov. @DanPatrick for a productive meeting at the Texas Capitol this morning. https://t.co/UdqjyqDLvT
For real change, Congress must hold the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras accountable for the wellbeing of their children. There’s a Burgess bill for that ➡️ https://t.co/r3L9Gr79NL
As Congress focuses on oversight, we must remember that lawmakers' rhetoric &amp; empty promises can be used by coyotes to entice families to attempt the dangerous journey to reach our border. This is just inhumane.
ICYMI: While Democrats are busy using @HHSGov ORR shelters as political props, I’m working to ensure that unaccompanied minors who cross our border are safe. https://t.co/wcogjM6Nar
Though other Members of Congress on this trip regard these shelters as nothing more than political props, I remain committed to doing our job – oversight. While they malign @POTUS, I’ll keep working alongside @SecAzar and @HHSgov to ensure that all kids receive quality care. https://t.co/wudXtCEz5H
During my visit to both the Homestead and Boystown ORR shelters today, I was pleased to see children receiving excellent care from dedicated @HHSGov staff. https://t.co/wYJyhQwIy0
I had a productive meeting with Assistant to the President and Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Ronny Jackson at the @WhiteHouse last week. I’m looking forward to working with this fellow Texan on our nation’s health care. https://t.co/y2eUq8ikNf
Alongside President @realDonaldTrump and @SecPompeo, I condemn this violent attack. https://t.co/ysvrsovFX0
Thank you to students from @leisd Oak Point Elementary for making these valentines for our local North Texas veterans receiving care at the Denton @DeptVetAffairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic. https://t.co/GQWck5lqWV
As @RulesReps considered the appropriations bill, I offered an amendment to hold the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras accountable for the well-being of their children. Though my amendment was not accepted, I believe this is the correct way to move forward.
The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, &amp; Honduras have been unable, and sometimes unwilling, to combat the corruption, drug trafficking, and gang violence that drive irregular migration. Congress must continue to encourage the leaders of these nations to take responsibility.
Since 2014, American taxpayers have spent more than $3 billion caring for other countries' children once they reach our border – in addition to the foreign assistance the U.S. provides to their home countries. Simply, it is wrong to charge Americans twice for the same purpose.
The flu is a formidable foe, but together we can protect our North Texas neighbors. Washing our hands, avoiding contact with sick people, and getting a flu shot are simple ways to help those who are more vulnerable to the virus. https://t.co/iMQEZqHDDl
ICYMI: @repgregwalden and I have asked @EnergyCommerce leaders to hold a hearing on their radical plans to force Americans into single-payer health care, eliminate private insurance, cost taxpayers $32 trillion, and end Medicare as we know it. https://t.co/TdgSdOrSwo
This @EnergyCommerce hearing is another attempt to distract from Dems' agenda to establish government-run, single-payer health care. Although they refuse to discuss their radical plan with GOP E&amp;C Members, they're clearly happy to share it with the media. https://t.co/WnkxDPetXy
Nearly every day, I hear from Texans about their sky-high premiums &amp; deductibles. What good is health insurance if you're afraid to use it because you can’t afford your deductible? Unfortunately today's @EnergyCommerce hearing is a missed opportunity to address this urgent issue.
Today I had the privilege of joining @NIH leaders for a discussion on the future of medical advancement. These remarkable men and women are tasked with propelling tomorrow’s innovation into results for the American people, and I’m grateful for their contributions. https://t.co/mX6m5JBmqx
I recently had an opportunity in @RulesReps to thank @HouseVetAffairs Leader @DrPhilRoe for his help to ensure that North Texas veterans could access newly-expanded services at the Denton VA, including critical mental health care resources. Watch here: https://t.co/ubjn7u9EyK
It was a pleasure to join #NHPC19 to discuss our @HouseCommerce accomplishments of the 115th Congress and outline a path forward to create better a health care system for American patients, physicians, and other health care providers. https://t.co/TVkmTgN23G
My friend @RepWalterJones was a faithful public servant whose life reflected his deep commitment to helping his fellow North Carolinians and the American people. I extend my sympathies to his wife Joe Anne, their family, and the people of North Carolina’s 3rd District.
Thank you to the @FlowerMoundHS Debate Team for stopping by the @uscapitol to meet with me during your trip to Washington, D.C. It was a privilege to talk with these bright North Texas students on the Capitol steps. https://t.co/LA4Y1SZ0wP
.@EnergyCommerce Democrats refuse to hold a hearing on their extreme health care plan to strip Americans of private health insurance, force patients into single-payer &amp; government-run health care, cost taxpayers $32 trillion, &amp; end Medicare as we know it .https://t.co/J97XiDm5Sx
This week I reintroduced H.R. 1040, the Flat Tax Act. Every Congress since 2003, I’ve introduced this commonsense legislation to ensure that all Americans pay their fair share in taxes. More: https://t.co/bGCHCMXGP3 https://t.co/wsHR4hLEQ2
Chairman John Dingell was a lifelong public servant and legislative giant. His matchless wisdom, persistence, and humor will be sorely missed in the halls of Congress, and especially in the Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room that bears his name.
Congress cannot bring back their loved ones, but my North Texas constituent Chris and other #AngelFamilies do deserve justice. We must act to protect the American people and defend our borders to prevent further heartbreak. #BorderSecurity https://t.co/nOqrcsYTIR https://t.co/KZcDzzuVpy
Under the Trump Administration, @SecAzar and @HHSGov are providing excellent care to the children entrusted to their custody. At today’s @EnergyCommerce hearing, we should recognize these public servants for their steadfast service to these children.
As a physician and a congressman, I take oversight of @HHSGov very seriously. Thanks to @HouseCommerce GOP’s efforts, unaccompanied children in ORR custody are now screened for medical, dental, and mental health, in addition to sexual abuse and vulnerability to #humantrafficking.
During the Obama Administration at the height of the unaccompanied minor crisis in 2014, I visited HHS ORR facilities and was horrified by the conditions I found.
Quite simply, it is downright inhumane to encourage families to make the dangerous journey to our southern border – often atop of La Bestia. https://t.co/veOtFGFikl
It’s always a pleasure to attend the National Prayer Breakfast, and I am glad that North Texans Vince and Mona Puente were able to join me for this outstanding event. https://t.co/Sx2PqMNLFP
I was saddened to hear about Chairman @JohnDingell's health challenges. My thoughts and prayers are with my friend &amp; Energy and Commerce legend @JohnDingell and @RepDebDingell at this difficult time.
Encouraging families to make the treacherous journey across the desert to our southern border is not only wrong, it’s inhumane. #SOTU https://t.co/gQqas6xyXV
This evening President @realDonaldTrump offered an optimistic message of hope and unity to the American people. My statement on tonight’s #SOTU: https://t.co/Sfb4YpaPJV
While Democrats are working to force Americans into government-run, single-payer health care, I’m fighting to lower drug costs and make the health care system work for – and not against – American patients and doctors. #SOTU
President Trump is committed to protecting workers &amp; fighting unfair #trade deals by equalizing U.S. tariffs with those of other nations. Congress should ensure @POTUS has the ability to negotiate from a position of strength for the American people. #SOTU https://t.co/ADzeMnWpk9
Sovereign nations must define + defend their borders. As Commander-in-Chief, President Trump should have the resources he needs to defend the American people from gang violence, crime, drugs, and human trafficking. #SOTU #BorderSecurity
All of us can - and should - work together to choose greatness for our fellow Americans. From strengthening our national defense to protecting American workers and investing in our infrastructure, President @realDonaldTrump is committed to creating a better tomorrow.  #SOTU
Despite Democrats’ obstruction, @realDonaldTrump’s Administration and Republicans in Congress continue to deliver on our promises to the American people. #SOTU https://t.co/eodejSNAaM
It’s an honor to welcome U.S. veteran, Angel Dad, and TX-26 constituent Chris to attend tonight’s #SOTU. https://t.co/dDUm8iTduB

Today @FCC Commissioner @BrendanCarrFCC and I attended the opening of @ericsson's new Lewisville facility, which joins a number of North Texas companies that are leading the way in innovation for the 21st century. https://t.co/RRfceqGuY2
Tomorrow morning, I'll join @MariaBartiromo at 6am CT/7am ET to preview President @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU and more. Hope you’ll tune in.

While Republicans focus on pro-growth policy, Democrats are fighting to strip hardworking Americans of their private insurance and force them into radical “one-size-fits-all” single-payer, government-run health care.
The excellent January #jobsreport not only indicates that 300,000+ more Americans have jobs, but also that more families have access to employer-sponsored health insurance - a far better option than #Obamacare marketplace or any other government-mandated coverage.
Thanks to @dentonisd leaders for visiting my D.C. office this week. We had a productive conversation about serving North Texas students. https://t.co/JmRpNcpOW4

President @realDonaldTrump has proven that he values the wellbeing of Americans over petty politics. In the coming days, @SpeakerPelosi should show up and work to find real solutions to defend our nation and provide stability for federal workers. My full statement: https://t.co/HwsToMl5Lg
Yesterday it was a privilege to catch up with Capt. Trey Gregory, who I nominated to attend the @NavalAcademy more than a decade ago, at the @uscapitol. Supporting North Texans who answer the call to serve our nation is an important part of my job, and I am grateful to them. https://t.co/HUVF1xQfYF
Today I joined President @realDonaldTrump at the @WhiteHouse to discuss the need for fair and balanced #trade that will bolster our economy and protect American workers. My statement: https://t.co/r4Jq7kZ925
It's always a pleasure to join @AmericanCancer at its annual You're Beautiful lunch to celebrate cancer fighters and survivors as America works toward a cure. https://t.co/JeD70gz1o1
Under @SpeakerPelosi's leadership, the House has wasted 330+ hours on political stunts - all while federal employees go without pay. It's past time for @HouseDemocrats to come to the table for good faith negotiations to secure our borders and reopen the federal government. https://t.co/1r5tp3JEuc

President @realDonaldTrump has shown that he’s willing to come to the table and fulfill his promises to the American people. It’s time for @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats to get serious about reopening the government and securing our borders.
This week, I had a productive meeting with @SBAList's Marilyn Musgrave on my work to promote commonsense #prolife policy. The fight for life is a team effort, and I am grateful to all who use their voices to help the most vulnerable among us. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/yirq5SDMk9
As a physician, my career was rooted in the truth that all life has meaningful potential. While my work has changed over the years-I now spend late nights on the House Floor instead of the delivery room-my dedication to #ProLife medicine remains steadfast. https://t.co/aLnnjRDzF4
I agree with President @realDonaldTrump. @SpeakerPelosi and @HouseDemocrats should stay in Washington until they reach a deal to reopen the government and secure American borders. https://t.co/9aE6z4qYn0
As I told @trish_regan, it's wrong to expect American taxpayers both to provide foreign aid to Central America and to care for unaccompanied children when they reach our borders. The simple fix? Americans must hold foreign leaders accountable for the well-being of their citizens. https://t.co/0rMw8t7Vls
I’m joining @trish_regan at 8pm ET. Tune in for our discussion on the Democrats’ unnecessary shutdown and their obstruction of the resources President @realDonaldTrump needs to defend our nation.

The last Administration clearly failed to fix what President Obama dubbed a humanitarian crisis in 2014. President @realDonaldTrump is committed to securing the southern border, and Congress must ensure he has the resources he needs to defend the nation. https://t.co/tqXjpnE8Me
#TBT: In 2014, President @BarackObama met with then-Gov. Rick Perry to discuss the flow of unaccompanied children crossing the southern border, yet refused to visit the border himself. As I've said since then, there's no substitute for showing up. https://t.co/bfRAq6FFqr

President @realDonaldTrump recognizes the urgent situation on the southern border as the humanitarian and national security crisis it is. Now is the time to #SecureOurBorder. My full statement on the #TrumpAddress: https://t.co/KTDmV6yNmr
As I've said for 5 years, there's no substitute for showing up. The brave men and women of @CBP are public servants who know the challenges of the southern border better than anyone in Washington. I encourage @POTUS to ask for their wise counsel as he considers #BorderSecurity.
I’ve traveled to #McAllen, TX many times since 2014, and it’s only right for President @realdonaldtrump to see firsthand the urgent situation on the southern border. What the last Administration labeled a humanitarian crisis is now a National Emergency with consequences. https://t.co/dUtWrVs5i3
It is an honor to be appointed to serve on the House Rules Committee for the #116thCongress. I'm looking forward to working alongside Ranking Member @TomColeOK04, @RepRobWoodall, and @RepDLesko on important policy, and I'm grateful to @GOPLeader for the opportunity.
My friend @RepLizCheney is a trailblazer and steadfast leader for the people of Wyoming and her fellow Americans. I served with her on @RulesReps last Congress, and I’m grateful to have her at the helm of @HouseGOP as chair of the GOP Conference for the #116thCongress. https://t.co/BjdniSal8Y
.@SouthwestAir co-founder Herb Kelleher's legacy includes vast contributions to North Texas &amp; our economy. It was a privilege to work alongside him and others to resolve the impasse known as the “Wright Amendment” several years ago. I'm grateful for his dedication to our region.
Despite what House Democrats are saying, the status quo on the southern border is simply unacceptable. As I told @MelissaAFrancis on @FoxBusiness last night, @HouseDemocrats should stop their senseless obstruction of the #bordersecurity that America needs. https://t.co/TEgOST2XnR https://t.co/77wnyvDd9w
Think Americans should be paying their fair share in taxes? There’s a flat tax for that. I plan to reintroduce this legislation in the #116thCongress. https://t.co/NgJBzNAvYw
Thanks to @HouseGOP and President @realdonaldtrump's pro-growth policies, the economy added 312,000 jobs last month. In the #116thCongress, I'll keep working to improve the economy for hardworking families in North Texas and beyond. https://t.co/JJ7N4yo06P
Today I took an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution as I serve the 26th District of Texas in the U.S. House. In the #116thCongress, I'll continue fighting to limit the role of government in Americans’ lives, strengthen national security, and bolster the economy.
I’m joining @FoxFriendsFirst bright and early this morning. Tune in at 5:30am ET as we discuss the critical need for #bordersecurity and what the #116thCongress will mean for President @realDonaldTrump’s Administration.

The defense of our nation must be Congress’ first priority. Period. I urge the Senate to join the House and pass H.R. 695, Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, which includes @POTUS’ requested funding to build a wall on our southern border &amp; protect the American people.
After months of bipartisan, bicameral work, I’m thrilled @POTUS has signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law. For families in North Texas and around the U.S., this law has personal significance and I’m grateful to all who have contributed their voices to this effort.
A sovereign nation must define and defend its borders. This morning I joined Lt. Col. @AllenWest on the @MarkDavis Show to discuss my efforts to fund border security in the U.S. House. Listen here: https://t.co/chHGEalk1h
Last night in @RulesReps I stood up for President Trump’s priorities and, along with fellow members, delayed consideration of the Senate’s appropriations bill. We must find a path forward for @POTUS’ requested funding to build a wall on the southern border and defend our nation.

I’m joining @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness in a few moments to discuss a path forward to secure American borders.
Last week I visited @CDCgov to learn more about the agency's work on some of the most urgent health care challenges we're facing today, including maternal mortality, influenza, and #AFM. @CDCDirector and his team are working hard to protect the American people. https://t.co/6fNwTypyjS
A century after the Spanish Influenza killed nearly 700,000 Americans and millions more worldwide, the Senate must complete its end of the bargain and pass the critical reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. #PAHPA https://t.co/WgtaxaXhw4
President Trump has signed my bill, H.R. 315, into law. The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act will help deliver quality, consistent care to American mothers in North Texas and beyond. I am grateful to all who helped to steward this lifesaving law across the finish line.
American health care should put patients first. This morning I joined @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria to discuss the latest ruling on #Obamacare and outline a way forward. https://t.co/CKgFwCBpZo
As I’ve said from the beginning, #Obamacare isn’t working for the American people. This ruling will be challenged; nevertheless, Congress should use this opportunity to deliver health reform that puts patients first.
Yesterday I had a productive conversation with @CDCgov Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat and @NIAIDNews Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about the recent uptick in acute flaccid myelitis (#AFM) cases as @housecommerce #SubHealth tracks its impact on American communities. https://t.co/F4tmnjmhHU
After months of bipartisan work to help our nation’s mothers, I’m grateful that the Senate has passed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, sending it to @POTUS' desk to become the law of the land. Thanks to Rep. @HerreraBeutler for leading this lifesaving legislation.
I'm tracking the bomb threats made in North Texas. While thankfully all have been deemed non-credible, remember to stay vigilant. If you see something, say something. https://t.co/lmg7KTxIG8

With today’s passage of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, the House has taken another step toward eliminating all preventable maternal deaths. Thanks to Rep. @HerreraBeutler for leading this work. Now, the Senate should pass this bill and send it to @POTUS’ desk. https://t.co/GUfgQVjYgM
Today on the House Floor, I had the privilege of managing debate for several critical health bills, including initiatives to end maternal mortality, combat sickle cell disease, prevent premature birth, and address traumatic brain injuries.

I’m on the House Floor speaking about legislation under consideration. You can follow along with my remarks on @cspan.
I had a productive conversation with @MariaBartiromo this morning about the critical need for border security. As a sovereign nation, America must define and defend its borders. It's time to #BuildTheWall. https://t.co/qshjL5CocT https://t.co/UGFPz0E1qs
I will continue to work alongside President @realdonaldtrump to secure America’s borders, restore order at ports of entry, and protect legitimate asylum seekers. Read my full statement on the #migrantcaravan: https://t.co/A6LHfKzj7o
Any misconduct in our U.S. Olympics community is simply unacceptable. Earlier this year, @HouseCommerce held a hearing with top Olympics officials. Here are the questions I asked about their plans to keep athletes safe. https://t.co/rxmIaGQy1n
ICYMI: It’s a special privilege to represent my fellow North Texans in Congress. Since January 2017, we have accomplished key goals to help Americans continue to succeed – from passing #taxreform to improving #healthcare and more. https://t.co/xgmycTp6Kg
As we reflect on the many blessings we enjoy as Americans, I give thanks for each constituent of TX-26. I wish you and your family a happy and safe #Thanksgiving. https://t.co/6TCOZbdr9Y
I’m looking forward to watching @KellerISD students march in the Macy’s #Thanksgiving Day Parade tomorrow morning. Good luck to @KellerHighBand. https://t.co/OROw8g74gI
This year, @DeptofDefense completed its first-ever audit. After 5 years of working to hold the Pentagon accountable to American taxpayers, I am encouraged to see this step in the right direction. #TBT: Read my #AuditThePentagon oped with @GroverNorquist: https://t.co/9bn5vrDbR2
ICYMI: I joined @FoxNews to offer a path to secure American borders. WATCH: https://t.co/WK1hDiHPgc
As I said on @FoxNews yesterday, our rhetoric matters. It is wrong to encourage families to make the dangerous journey to our border without the benefit of citizenship. We must hold Central American leaders accountable for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens. https://t.co/9opDOkLWeW
I’m monitoring the #AcuteFlaccidMyelitis situation, and appreciate @CDCDirector and @CDCgov's work to find answers for patients and families. https://t.co/B44rINFYRa
As Congress seeks to rebuild our Armed Forces, it is more important than ever to ensure that the DOD is working to meet its full potential. My amendment to #AuditThePentagon has been included in the #NDAA since 2015. My statement on @DeptofDefense’s first-ever audit: https://t.co/k0Hs5s9HxF
The @DeptofDefense’s first-ever audit is a step in the right direction. For 5 years, I've been advocating to #AuditThePentagon. Taxpayers should know what we've bought, how much it cost, where it is, whether it's working, and what we need for the future. https://t.co/Tzh3WSl0Rj
It was a pleasure to help honor members of America's uniformed service who responded to the communities devastated by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma &amp; Maria.

I'm looking forward to working with @GOPLeader McCarthy, Whip @SteveScalise &amp; Chair @RepLizCheney to keep delivering on our promises to the American people. I was encouraged by the show of unity when Rep. @Jim_Jordan congratulated Leader McCarthy. Now it's time to get to work.
Thanks to @dallasnews for sharing these helpful tips about avoiding the #flu. We can all do our part to help protect our family, friends, and North Texas neighbors. https://t.co/MXvGmxbnjC
Yesterday I had the privilege of joining students, teachers, and faculty at @McMathMS to pay tribute to North Texas veterans.  #VeteransDay https://t.co/vecWOjheWS

On #VeteransDay, we honor those in North Texas and beyond who have fought to protect American freedom. Our veterans have made immense sacrifices to serve, and they deserve the upmost respect. It is in the sacrifice and service of our veterans that we see the American spirit. https://t.co/gbKi1NrVlc
A century after the end of World War I, we thank those throughout American history who have fought for our freedom. #VeteransDay https://t.co/VhLiZ4ilWH

Throwback: Read more about the Obama Administration’s move to block Americans’ access to an over-the-counter asthma inhaler. #TBT https://t.co/UJ1sFAyWh4
In 2011, President Obama’s EPA banned a widely-used inhaler. Thanks to Dr. @SGottliebFDA + @US_FDA, this over-the-counter medicine has been restored. After years of fighting for this move, I am glad to see this win for American asthma patients. https://t.co/3iazG91Ke0
It is an honor to represent you in Congress, and I look forward to serving North Texas in the 116th Congress.
I agree with Senator @JohnCornyn. Thank you for your long service to Alabama, the U.S. Senate, and our country, AG Sessions. https://t.co/dch0UFkgfC
Last winter, @SecretaryAcosta came to TX-26 to visit the future home of a North Texas veteran – U.S. Army SPC Daniel Dumas – and his family. I consider the privilege of serving North Texas #veterans one of the most important parts of my job. https://t.co/Rft27lT0X6
America can be compassionate and America can define + defend its borders. It’s time to hold the leaders of Central American countries responsible for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens, and stop the cycle that leads to irregular migration. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH
Rep. Sam Johnson, who will retire at the end of the 115th Congress, spent nearly seven years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In February, I spoke on the House Floor in honor of my fellow Texan's 45th "Returniversary." @SamsPressShop https://t.co/8XIfpLStO0
Less than a year after President @realDonaldTrump signed #taxreform into law, we’ve experienced record-breaking economic growth. In October, our economy added 250,000 jobs. https://t.co/VYmDMmXGKi
American consumers should know how @facebook uses their data. In April, I had the opportunity to ask Mark Zuckerberg. WATCH our conversation here: https://t.co/9eDYgcn3kT
Over the summer, I had the privilege of joining North Texan Sadie Keller and President @RealDonaldTrump at the White House for the signing of the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. WATCH my remarks from the Oval Office. https://t.co/ksOH8bjJWu
The U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs in October. Coupled with the biggest wage increase in a decade (3.1 percent) and the lowest unemployment since 1969 (3.7 percent), this #JobsReport indicates encouraging growth for North Texans and all Americans. https://t.co/VYmDMmXGKi
Earlier this year, Texans and Americans across the country mourned the loss of former First Lady Barbara Bush – an incredible role model for patriotism, compassion, and courage to always do what is right. WATCH my tribute to her on the House Floor. https://t.co/Dcx1nYZkKu
BIG: Contrary to what you may hear in the news, there is a greater percentage of Americans in employer health coverage today than at any time since 2000. Here's what that means for Americans with #PreExistingConditions. https://t.co/rLq3Fbk2ZN
I'm sorry to learn of the loss of @HHSgov's Dan Best - a committed partner in @housecommerce and Congress' work to improve health care for the American people. My prayers are with Dan's family, friends, and the HHS community at this difficult time.
As caravans from Central America travel to our southern border, we must address the cycle of poverty, violence, and corruption that leads families to leave their home countries. Here’s a real solution. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH
Last week, President Trump signed #HR6 into law – culminating months of bipartisan work to combat our nation’s #opioidcrisis. WATCH my remarks on this landmark bill before we sent it to President @realDonaldTrump's desk: https://t.co/tsNpmcFMVI
There’s nothing scary about this news – Wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase in a decade. Thanks to #taxreform, our economy is finally working for the American people. https://t.co/YagNABSv73
As #HealthCare trends in the news, it’s time to set the record straight on #preexistingconditions. @HouseGOP is committed to creating a fair system in which ALL patients are protected. Watch my full remarks: https://t.co/P35mbJreSi https://t.co/IOPGHGmVH6
THROWBACK: Earlier this year, Senate Democrats shut down the federal government to hold up funding for #CHIP – a program upon which millions of American families rely. While the government was shut down, I headed down to the Floor to correct the record. https://t.co/6H7AVqLH4U
As 2018 comes to a close, I am working on compiling this year's Year End Report [read last year's here: https://t.co/HyXuYCh0AM]. Over the next few weeks, we'll take a look back at some of my work to serve North Texas.
In the midst of this tragedy, the American people must come together for the sake of our neighbors in #Pittsburgh, in North Texas, and around the country. Together, we can build a better future for generations of Americans yet to come. /4
We must commit to working together, listening to one another, and reaffirming our belief that each person has been created and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. /3
The U.S. Constitution guarantees a number of unalienable rights, including the freedom to practice the religion of one’s choice - a core tenant of our American democracy. In the United States of America, no one should be afraid of worshiping freely.  /2
This week, I join my fellow Americans in mourning the eleven innocent lives taken needlessly in the #SquirrelHill attack - an act of pure evil.  /1 https://t.co/tEeNUYaBYq https://t.co/Lpqz43ZYp5

WATCH: Each year, America generously welcomes over a million immigrants to our country. We also must define + defend our borders. In July, I went to the House Floor to discuss the situation on our southern border and trace the roots of this crisis. #TBT https://t.co/V4KHbhv0YC
It's been a privilege to help steward life-saving legislation that will touch every facet of our nation's #opioidcrisis. It is my hope that our efforts will spare any additional families from the devastation of opioid addiction and provide hope to communities across America. https://t.co/cmJjBC8yeB
This afternoon, I am looking forward to joining @realDonaldTrump as he signs #HR6 into law - culminating the hard work of #SubHealth, @HouseCommerce and @HouseGOP to get this life-saving legislation across the finish line and deliver results to the American people.
.@VP is correct. Violence - against elected officials, the media, or any other human being - is always inherently wrong and absolutely unacceptable. Period. Those responsible for these cowardly attempted attacks must be brought to justice. https://t.co/T0qgbAazom
We cannot expect American taxpayers to both 1) provide foreign assistance for Central American countries and 2) provide care for unaccompanied children who cross our border. If we keep doing what we've been doing, nothing will change. It's time to act. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH
I support President @realDonaldTrump's efforts to define + defend American borders. Despite the cable news criticism of this strategy, it is the best path forward. If @realdonaldtrump wants Congress to take up this endeavor, there’s a Burgess bill waiting. https://t.co/5SKOYmAMsH
President @realdonaldtrump is expected to sign #HR6 into law this week, furthering our fight against the #CrisisNextDoor. This bill, a culmination of months of bipartisan work, will help families affected by opioid abuse in North Texas and across the U.S. https://t.co/gnRKGj2hIR
Foreign aid can be a powerful motivator for the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala &amp; #Honduras. We should ensure that American assistance given to these countries is redirected to organizations working to address the circumstances that spur people to leave. https://t.co/X5XRQXmnUp https://t.co/RR7T0sYUfr
Over the summer, I traveled to Honduras to meet with local officials and learn firsthand about the corruption, poverty, and violence that is spurring families to leave. To end this cycle, we must hold Central American leaders accountable. MORE: https://t.co/vPRSQyWW0K https://t.co/v2VDuj1fPG
.@dallasnews didn't get quite the whole story. If we keep doing what we've been doing, we'll keep getting what we've been getting. The leaders of El Salvador, Honduras + Guatemala need to step up and take responsibility for their people. My solution: https://t.co/lqoEixbeTN https://t.co/6cdS7c8Yob
We must hold the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras accountable for the wellbeing of their people. That’s why I’ve been introducing the Unaccompanied Alien Children Assistance Control Act since July 2014. https://t.co/WAZhed4qXa
America’s foreign aid funds are much better spent helping to build a better life for children in these Central American countries than caring for them in HHS-ORR shelters once they reach our border. For things to change, we must act.
President @realdonaldtrump is on the right track. To break this cycle, we must end the status quo. There’s a Burgess bill for that --&gt; https://t.co/lqoEixbeTN https://t.co/4Xxw7L1uAm
Do not be fooled: Anyone who says that House Democrats’ government-run #healthcare bill will allow individuals to keep their private health insurance is lying to the American people. https://t.co/AhxN1QRGrA https://t.co/hONhkTB1O8

ICYMI: The @dallasnews published an editorial highlighting Congress’ bipartisan work to combat the opioid crisis in Texas and around the country. We expect President @realDonaldTrump to sign H.R. 6 into law soon. https://t.co/jqq6CDiYUF
Today President @realdonaldtrump signed a bill into law that will eliminate “gag clauses” at the pharmacy, improving transparency and helping to lower drug prices for the American people. https://t.co/7o4f0F2hFR
From provisions included in the 21st Century Cures Act to our latest work in H.R. 6 to address the #opioidcrisis, @housecommerce #SubHealth has prioritized helping individuals and families affected by mental health and/or substance use disorders find the support they need.
On #WorldMentalHealthDay, I reaffirm my commitment to help North Texans and Americans across the country access quality mental health care. For those in need, @samhsagov has a free, confidential 24/7 help line: 1-800-662-HELP (4357). https://t.co/Hu3k0U4luw

Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a qualified jurist who will uphold the original interpretation of the U.S. Constitution as the Framers intended. My statement on the Senate confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the #SCOTUS: https://t.co/H4mAOx1PZe
Thanks to President @realdonaldtrump and @HouseGOP, in September the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent for the first time since 1969. Since January of last year, the economy has added more than 3.8 million jobs. This is good news for North Texans and all Americans.
In September 2018, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent for the first time since 1969. For perspective, the last time the unemployment rate was this low, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, the Beatles released “Abbey Road, ” and I was a student at @UNTnews.
As I told @MariaBartiromo yesterday morning, the people of Texas and Americans around the country are ready for this cruel process to end. It's time for the Senate to complete its work on the #SCOTUS nomination. https://t.co/AQPwxO8h3e
Those who travel to our border without citizenship face a perilous journey through the desert. Our foreign aid funds are much better spent helping to provide a safe home for children in Central American countries than spent caring for them in taxpayer-funded shelters in the U.S. https://t.co/17xVBfnfWo
Thanks @MariaBartiromo for having me on @FoxBusiness to talk about our nation’s immigration crisis. If we are ever to end the cycle of poverty and corruption in the Central American countries from which many  travel to the U.S. border, we must change our course of action. https://t.co/IC11GFeG95

It’s a privilege to be in Washington this morning to pay my final respects to Senator McCain. Today this American hero will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol – a rare honor that has been granted to just a few great Americans in our nation’s history.
As we seek solutions for our immigration crisis, we must consider why families are willing to send their kids on the dangerous journey to our border. Foreign leaders must be held accountable for their citizens' wellbeing. Our foreign aid funding should be dependent on results.

We can be compassionate and we can provide a secure border at the same time. These two concepts are not mutually exclusive. It's time to end this broken pattern. We must find a solution. We must secure our borders. https://t.co/voashGufLE
Aid can be a powerful motivator. As we determine appropriations for FY 2019, all Members of Congress should consider the foreign aid we'll agree to send to Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and even Mexico – the countries whose children are fleeing to the U.S. for their safety.
It is simply irresponsible - it is inhumane - for the American government to incentivize anyone to subject themselves or their children to the perilous journey to our border.
We know coyotes &amp; traffickers use our rhetoric to prey on the disadvantaged, encouraging families to put their children on top of La Bestia to travel to the U.S. When we say – or even suggest – that children could receive amnesty at the border, we put innocent lives at risk.
President @realdonaldtrump has said that the highest sovereign duty of the President is to defend this Nation, which includes the defense of our borders. I believe that America is a country worth defending.
In 2014, President Obama faced a crisis when a flood of unaccompanied alien minors crossed our southern border from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala &amp; Mexico. There is no question that @BarackObama's “catch-and-release” policies contributed to today's situation.
As @SteveChapman13 wrote on January 17, 1993, mere days before @BillClinton took office: “A lot of Haitians are disappointed to find [Clinton is] something less than a man of his word. They're not the only ones.” https://t.co/DdiJfFnwcX
In the 1992 election, @BillClinton campaigned on ending the Bush Administration’s “cruel” practice of returning Haitian refugees fleeing to the U.S. by boat. After winning the election, in a @VOANews address to the Haitian people on January 14, 1993, he had a change of heart. https://t.co/5ufR15vI5l
In 1980, the Carter Administration grappled with a flood of Cuban refugees attempting to reach the US by boat. Carter officials, including Sec. Muskie and Nat'l Security Advisor Brzezinski, were part of a discussion where "it was suggested that boats could be rammed or shot at." https://t.co/2KmKufme47
In my latest Floor speech, I traced the roots of our current immigration crisis. There is significant evidence that enforcement-first policy deters people from subjecting themselves and their children to dangerous journeys to reach the U.S. border - whether by land or by sea.
There's no question that America has a crisis on our southern border. As 30,000+ people stream across each month without the benefit of citizenship, all Americans can agree that our immigration system is broken. https://t.co/V4KHbhv0YC

In 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger of the Union Army arrived in Galveston to announce the end of the Civil War and - at long last - enforce the #EmancipationProclamation. Today I join my fellow Americans in celebrating #Juneteenth2018 as the end of slavery in Texas and our nation.
Here’s the good news – Congress is considering two immigration bills this week. Any changes that are made will be the result of legislation passed by Congress and signed into the law of the land. This is the way democracy works.
Returning to President Lincoln’s sage advice - we know that to change enforcement, we must change the law.
As we consider solutions, we must hold foreign countries accountable to improving the lives of their children. That’s why I introduced H.R. 120 – to withhold foreign aid from countries that send children across our borders and into @HHSgov custody. https://t.co/LLSwJhAtzh
As my fellow Texan @RepCuellar said in 2014, human smuggler "coyotes" are becoming rich by bringing Central American children to the border. https://t.co/8zZ52uIcAy
Those who are determined to come to America illegally, as @RichLowry writes, should leave children at home. However, with the current system, "We are creating an incentive to do the opposite and use children to cut deals with smugglers." https://t.co/iVNTmJ91zE
From October 2017 to February 2018, @DHSgov experienced a 315% increase in illegal aliens using children to pose as family units to gain entry into the country.
The American government should not incentivize illegal immigration. In the interest of safety, we must not encourage sending kids through dangerous conditions in order to cross the border and gain entry.
As President Trump has said, the United States has “the world's worst immigration laws.” All Americans can agree that our immigration system is broken. https://t.co/wedFZC3rUr
On the border, the Trump Administration is enforcing existing law – a constitutional responsibility of the executive branch.
It was our 16th U.S. President Abraham Lincoln who said, “The best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly.”

As the House considers #RightToTry, I stand with the President and I stand with Americans suffering from terminal illness, their families, and their friends to get this policy to @realdonaldtrump's desk. It is time to offer American patients the “right to try" here at home. https://t.co/rbuyCR5jO0
Last week, the House passed the VA Mission Act to ensure our veterans have timely access to quality health care options. It's time for the Senate to pass this bill and send it to President Trump's desk. https://t.co/fMvAsJxxcD

Last Friday, President Trump took calculated action against unjust brutality in Syria. If further military force is deemed necessary to deter the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons, Congress needs to authorize that action. https://t.co/Ct0QsrjKTs

Back in 1997, Dilbert got it right. Twenty-one years later, too few Americans read the "terms and conditions" we agree to everyday. Consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data. https://t.co/FIJbb6BCfQ
There’s a powerful, inherent human proclivity to document and share about our lives. Social media like @facebook gives us tools far beyond a petroglyph, but requires an abundance of caution. https://t.co/oWWekGNHYg

.@HouseGOP passed a bill requiring @POTUS to put forward comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS #SOTU
.@POTUS fails to acknowledge Iranian arrest of @USNavy sailors in #SOTU further proving how out of touch w/ reality he is w/ Iran situation
.@POTUS continues to make empty promises about changing "outdated regulations" &amp; "cutting red tape" for private sector growth #SOTU
Nat'l sec is #1 issue for Americans. @POTUS' strategy to defeat ISIS is weak &amp; failing. It's time to do more to make Americans feel safe.
.@HouseGOP has boosted funding for our military, ensuring our troops are well-equipped to carry out their mission #SOTU
#Cures2015 is a full offset, fiscally sound and puts tomorrow's #cures in the hands of patients today #SOTU
Once again another presidential speech concludes w/o any outline of a strategy-- a strategy to defeat ISIS, a strategy to revive our economy
#Obamacare has proven to be a careless, experiment with Americans' health care #SOTU
Tonight @POTUS will extol his so-called "legacy" during his last #SOTU yet the majority of Americans believe his policies are failing
As @HouseGOP works towards actionable progress, @POTUS advances his agenda through exec. actions showing how isolated his stance has become.
.@POTUS must address the Safe Harbor negotiations in #LastSOTU. There is no U.S. trade partnership more imp. than that with the EU.

Core functions of both the federal and state-based exchanges of the #ACA have yet to be completed. http://t.co/ttxwiuC3M3
Great Point - “One of the great drivers of costs is medical malpractice, which wasn’t addressed in the Affordable Care Act.” #smallbiz
Kelly: “There are four fees that will go into effect next year.  Those fees alone will cost my company $48,000 next year.”
Morrow: “The coverage we have, we would like to keep but the coverage we are being mandated to have is unaffordable”
Hugh Morrow, Ruby Falls LLC: "This past year we saw premium increases of 21% and are projected to see higher than 30% increases in 2014."
Lozinsky cont: "This law that was supposed to help lower income works will hurt our lower income workers"
Lozinsky "It looks like our only option will be to cut our employees hours to under 30 hours."
Speaking now is Steve Lozinsky, Sparkle and Shine Cleaning Services in North Carolina.
Kelly: "A one size fits all approach, with arbitrary standards and impractical requirements is not going to work and is not lowering costs"
Jeff Kelly: "ACA is proving to be unpredictable and unaffordable. Since the passage of law in 2010, our health care premiums have risen 46%"
"At a time when the country is just starting to find relief, we can't afford the job loss the Affordable Care Act will cause."
