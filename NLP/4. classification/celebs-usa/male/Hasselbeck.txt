@willowdavis5152 @Patriots @Chiefs @Chargers @FirstTake @GetUpESPN @ESPNNFL @nflnetwork Willow.. Not sure what you’re talking about. I’ve been talking about Joe Thuney all year. Gave him game balls before and after win vs Chicago Bears. Praised their renewed commitment to the run starting in Week 16. Did you also know he can also solve a Rubix Cube in &lt; 90 seconds?
@20XFB15 @GarryGraham14 All sales are final. 😂

@TheBlueMare It means he wants to hear the play in his helmet via the “Coach-to-QB” communication system.
@a_gerasch Play both QB’s today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So do they get the ball on the 30 inch line again?
If the Watt play isn’t a TD... then this isn’t a TD.
3Q and the Ravens are finally in Chargers territory! Not ideal.

@ATousaw @dallascowboys It might a little soon for me. Still a little salty about last night. 😕😕😕

@TheGeeScott I will say that the Indianapolis airport is 💯.
@TheGeeScott That’s a trap.

@AdamSchefter I know. Temple has matched UCF’s explosive plays all night. Great game.
@KNegandhiESPN @thekidmcmanus The defenses didn’t survive the 1st half. 🤣
@KNegandhiESPN @thekidmcmanus They may score 100 points in this game. #UCFvsTemple
@KNegandhiESPN @thekidmcmanus Either way, this has been really fun to watch so far. #UCFvsTEM
@thekidmcmanus @KNegandhiESPN This is on it’s way to being an 80 point game as well. #UCFvsTemple

@TroyAikman This is helpful Troy. 👏  I wasn’t sure how to say his name anymore so I just stopped saying it. 😕  Sort of like when I don’t order minestrone soup because I’m not totally sure how to say that either. 😂

@Macdad38 Did I see some @ChrisGray62 love all over the #SpaceNeedle?!! https://t.co/YLflvpnlDc
@AaronQ13Fox Good to hang with you &amp; @jordanbabineaux last night.
@Macdad38 I saw a few #38’s out there last night. Where have all the Fullbacks gone?!?! None better than the Mack Truck!
@shaunalexander Good to see you Shaun... it’s been a long time!
@PSchrags @MatthewPerry @MatthewModine @McConaughey @Lions @gmfb I don’t know if that qualifies as ‘big love’ 🤔? That was about as luke warm to cold as it gets. 😂
@danorlovsky7 Wouldn’t you?!!?!
So good to be back.
@bhofheimer_espn @12s @Seahawks Oops. Is that game tonight!?!?! 😳
@cthefallguy Goff! 👍👍
@lorrie_gatewood No price... just time.

@MarcWood71 Jax #EliAsTheirQB
@BECrim71 Credit goes to Drew Brees. Washington is playing well all things considered.
@GodIago Yes. Send to ESPN. I’m a little behind on signings.
@TheCrappyTotals Legion of Injuries this year. 😕
@BennySel96 But I love Dak too... just not Dallas’ year. I had them all the way last year! Dang ARod!!
@BennySel96 Wentz Wagon
@Giants_Pro I’ve got far worse than that!!!
@PdotJdot11 Playing their way OUT of the playoffs.
@OGJackyor Pat. But honorable mention to Mewhort and Reitz.
@Zzzack518 @BigWalt71 Best 2 Ever Do It.... but no.
@kfrigo23 My go-to’s were Santorini Grill, Cactus, and El Gaucho.
@ambo1228 That one didn’t end up being fun. 🙃
@cmarkus21 I would think so.
@JimiV_87 Too many to choose from!!! I love Seattle.
@ImChrisSmith I do know that Mike is a good QB coach. Taught me a lot.
@rollincrispys No doubt.
@Grantt2014 Someone cares too much about their Twitter timeline.
@celticpride81 Tough to do!!
@BrownsScout Not ready to do that but it’s NEVER what the mass media tells you.
@T_Schlub I’d expect them to stop the bleeding at 4.
@walrusbanjo Spags is a good scheme DC.
@GCSeldon Educated guess but each offseason you have to bring your absolute best or it won’t happen!
@StickEquips My guy!!! #Sticks

@CollinStraka You have to ask @studie32
@Sharks771 I was 4-0 at 40 until I separated my ribs. Brady just needs to stay healthy and he will continue to dominate.
@B_Skip17 Roller coaster... finish strong! I like him though.
@Sharksizzle XBHS!!!!
@WillWithers30 Feel bad for the kid... not even close to ready!
@cegrossmann The team in Mexico right now. 🇲🇽

@nastyjayau @buffalobills Still in the playoff hunt. Tyrod can make a statement the rest of the way! Seize it!!

Congrats to my HS @XBHS_Football on another trip to the Massachusetts Div 1 Super Bowl @GilletteStadium !
@JoeReitz76 You probably thought @DesmondTrufant was @dwightfreeney or somebody when you first thought about sliding. 🙃
@JoeReitz76 Excellent point! Truth be told.. I thought you were @doylejack84 when I first thought about pitching it. 😳
@robin__legrand @JoeReitz76 Fair point!
@JoeReitz76 I thought that play could get us 1 yard vs the Atlanta Falcons but my big 6’6” 300+ lb right tackle decided to slide after he got a 1/2 yard. 🙃
@C_Harnish X Y Hook!!!!
@cheezit @Pringles .. and the @XBHS_Football way! Way to go Hawks!

@Kenny_Mayne @Seahawks Almost as big as this trade!
Denver has 16 Turnovers this year (7 Fumbles lost) #DENvsKC 😳😳
@RPreston53 Postgame!
@SiHox12 Amen! 😨
Denver Offense out of sync/rhythm last 3 games.
Good time for Broncos to cause &amp; recover a fumble.
@TopSpeedLLC Wrong. Von said he has respect for DT, so it’s special when he plays here. #58
@2liveunStews @AdamSchefter They will sign a Vet.
Fumbles on offense and not causing them on defense has been crushing the Broncos this season. #29thInTurnoverDifferential

@Delialubanovici Well I appreciate it even if they don’t. 👍
@BenihanaGT @AdamSchefter Even my man @wallace_seneca got hurt at WR that year I think!

The 2 Short Yardage stops by KC defense were HUGE tonight.
@123JeremyJ More like 1 in a million!
Holy Toledo.
@TaylorTwellman You called it. #HopeNot
@DilfersDimes Eye candy 🍭
Alex Smith's stat line is something out of Madden 18. 👀
@nobrown22 That may be more frustrating!
This game is unreal. #KCvsNE
Can we do our Fantasy Draft over again?
RIDICULOUS #47yardsPerPlay https://t.co/gLCT0yXUyj
@SFCJensen I don't know, but great game!
@REAL_AndyMack Hire Andy! #HeShouldBeBoss
@Swavey83 One is including playoffs.
😡 https://t.co/IlVL1CydGa
@20XFB15 True story.
So you're saying there's a chance! https://t.co/D635ymUgip
That's a lot of plays in the 1st Q! #FastBreakOffense https://t.co/72AFLxFq7v
@JLaurinaitis55 Disgusting.
@madnessnyc Agree
@GirlyVirgo78 Hi.
@Kenny_Mayne @TheJimmyGraham At least 12!
If you love watching TE's... this is your Super Bowl. #KCvsNE
I love watching these coaches scheme, two of the best! #PatsVsChiefs
The NFL is back!!
@MSK5kiss Lone Pine?
😉 https://t.co/l3boYrlqPY
As Coach Fritz Shurmur would say on this day, "Cuts are never final."  I learned that the hard way in '98.  (thx @rickmirer) https://t.co/3YnCfhHVA8
Way to go Jake! https://t.co/oQFnf5fzNq
I've had to change my playoff teams 3x because of all these trades! #wow
@LisaKerneyESPN ... and a QX80
@tthasselbeck @jayfeely It's a Hard Knock life for us.
@jayfeely True story. Maybe a couple trash bags and cardboard boxes if you've been on the team for awhile.
I can't wait for the Browns 2020 season. 🕰
@BadGuy711 Agree!!!!
With that being said... I've been traded and cut... neither feel very good at the time. #NFLtrades #NFLcutDay
One silver lining for NFL players recently traded (instead of cut), team pays for one 1st class ticket and your moving/relocation fees. #CBA
@JJWatt Well done Justin James!
@richeisen @redmckinney That jersey has some miles on it Rich, so somebody has been wearing it!
@redmckinney Lookin' good! #8
@4thandLongwell @doylotennis @lleytonhewitt Do we have a football or lacrosse program yet?
@Wowigotnowords @PatrickMahomes5 Perfect spot for him to develop. I like Andy &amp; Alex a lot.
@wingoz Bald by choice. 😳 #Pinocchio
@ArmandoFootball Zebra Spread Left 3 Jet Double Option HB Wide
@MikeeFarrar Win/win?

@its_christmass Let me work on my game.
@20XFB15 Coffee!
@dominic_pirak Carolina game is my all-time favorite
@ssvajian @XBHS My hair was great but never as smooth as yours!
@GeneralAip812 Only ever cared/listened to trash talk from my friends.
@noattachments8 NEVER
@GordyMegroz Princess Leia?
@BYFFL 👍👍
@MattLaCombe Sort of true #Jan2008
@SeahawksBMX Sure, send to @espn.
@1_800_AXE_Matty Paleo Crunch
@monkeydvince2 Mark Bavaro or John Elway
@VinceSaiz96 For sure
@nhgator13 The automile is tough to beat!
@saiz_vince Whoever my dad was playing for.. Pats, LA Raiders, Vikings, NYG
@ErikMahler Good idea!
@iruhl426 Bacon
@aaroschu It's obvious
@jshoeshine NHL 95 best game ever
@RickMirer Favorite roommate at training camp went to Notre Dame 🍀
@VincentSaiz Love it!
@CynthiaPaap Peace Corps
@Maybe_YesSir Wise man. Pruitt not at fault though.. his job was to emulate Troy P #43 all week. John Howell &amp; Marquand Manuel also got hurt. Tough deal.
@JKfBaby93 @TYHilton13 He's a stud.
@DannibusX Wish we would've won!
@johncanderson21 TNF vs Houston slant &amp; go to @TYHilton13 to end the game.
@11plus1TrueHawk @BigWalt71 Hilarious. I blame/credit Tobeck.
@sgarzahawks12 Had that injury from Detroit game that season. That TD run was final straw.
@TheColtsFanatic We loved Indy.
@vincesaiz1 Yes
@tchern7 Not sure but he can pinch you with his long toes.
@NFL_Beast_1501 Flexible hamstrings
@JKfBaby93 @PatMcAfeeShow John Randle wasn't crazy but opponents thought he was!
@jcyzycki 100% of us will get to do it.
@zeke_werden During my 1st mini camp thanks to talk from Andy Reid. I was just happy to be there.
@edoc82775 It sure was!
@MJPerry64 Vs KC in 2003 I think.
@GuyEast Always willing!
@joemac484 Dilfer was HOF prankster
@fan2colts Saved by grace... can't boast!
@tjrueve @jgiuliani7 No idea.
@PSchrags Ask Nate if he know what coach asked me that.
@mrandmrsawesom1 Give it away
@semwin2 @tonyromo He's got a good gig.
@charlieg67 My kids are going for this guy https://t.co/I7iGUQHlq9
@irishpetedoyle 2001 Eagles D was legit
@Dansmets19 @DunkinDonuts Cold Brew #ThankMeLater
@maureenfox @Matt_Gerrish Or a Reno 911 outfit!
@frank_fjc509 Only when someone says Detroit.
@HistoricPackers @RickMirer I think it was in the back of Frank Winter's truck at one point. #AndyReidDroveItSometines
@ArmyofAdam Peyton had Colts rolling one year.
@ndwade I don't remember but I think I had dessert BEFORE dinner. #Savage
@TheNateBecker I work on Sundays. #NotIdealTiming
@Alabamafan40 Both but don't forget the equipment guys and athletic trainers!
@MarcusPeeples Super Elite!

@alexsizemore24 Waited too long!
@george24hite Math
@mariners1144 #B2EDi @BigWalt71
@bobbvy435 I hit Powerball lottery with teammates
@TPMcMullen McCaffery or Mixon
@gmbremer Is Wade Philips still playing a lot of cover 1?
@GetzAustin Catching a TD pass would've been epic!
@Travisty_88 I hit the Powerball lottery with teammates!
@DaRealLevikins Lots of great ones... @ElGauchoSteak is fun.
@ctylerbooth Guessing yes. #NotIdeal
@NickBeII My kids love that movie.
@senCyr Ferrari or Lamborghini?
@fLAno0 Lots to choose from but throwing a 99 yard TD to my backup QB vs BC High to win the game was pretty memorable. #XBHS
@ryanmarket1 My kids
@AlanR3nnard Old Country &gt; New Country #FightMe
@sbwebster15 Kenny Mayne is hilarious
@llcooltray New job, not quite retired.
@bandb311 @PatMcAfeeShow No but being around Pat is pretty epic no matter what day it is.
@noble68 Great spot but don't sleep on 1933 Lounge
@JKfBaby93 2nd fiddle to the legend @adamvinatieri
@ejf_1287 Having fun with friends.
@Noy3s Lots of great WR's to choose from but throwing to @JerryRice in Mike Holmgren's offense was absolutely amazing. #surreal
@newport_chase Love that kid. Top 10 teammate of all time.
@BCCheechees 15 games????
@Noy3s Friends
@LilJonny3 B&amp;G Oysters
@MrColtsFan12 Strahan was a big pain in the butt.
@metallica_87 Every day
@JKfBaby93 Too many to name. Great guys.
@TheGeeScott That cannot be true. #3LittleKids #Cheerios #Raisins #Goldfish
@LilJonny3 Somewhere in East Nasty. Maybe @LockelandTable
@B_rabb86 Run for the pylon!
@Matt_Gerrish Maybe in San Diego!
@rnavarro5150 Thanks Ryan.
@Dugless206 My fault 100%.
@CatDogPerson Never seen an episode.
@JKfBaby93 He is a huge fan of Clint Dempsey and Condoleezza  Rice. #Random
@walterdwang It wasn't as good as starring on The Knightrider #MichaelKnight
@Louis_Ville It was brief! Went to that camp as a kid. Tom Coughlin gave me my first scholarship offer after that. #BC
@western10 Fortunate to have many many great coaches along the way... huge factor in my success.
@Jofus77 @billromanowski  @michaelstrahan @jharrison9292 #TakeYourPick
@vincesaiz1 That would be great!
@BYFFL That's going on my resume.
@CitiusMag Fastest time was 4:59 at AAU Junior Olympics in 5th grade (got 2nd place). Nowhere near that now!
@voomdoom1 Broke my wrist punching him my freshman year in HS.
@SFCJensen GIF winner!
@DuncanJTerry Great question. Someone needs to develop young QB's!
@SeaProps Like picking a scab.
@HahaDABO Both will be longtime starters in the @nfl.
@camboespn @tthasselbeck @AdamSchefter I blame my bosses for all those carnival game segments.
@booman64 Very unfortunate! Feel bad for him.
@H2Poe I love JC, glad I got to play with him.
@vincesaiz1 Maybe!
@notdonenever I tried to avoid the good and the bad that writers would write... nothing personal but always helped to keep my focus on opinion of coaches.
@AaronQ13Fox @Hooters I can't even imagine.
@3lone Woof woof
@vincesaiz1 Dodgers vs Sox would be epic
@TumbarelloHB Shave 2x per week. #ProTip
@wtladybuff10 More to it than that.. backups sometimes need to be invisible. He is a good kid though for what it's worth.
@wtladybuff10 He has enough talent. 2nd string QBs aren't always the 33rd most talented QBs in the world.
@Matt_Gerrish Please No. It was only a joke to relax the team.
@Moneymarin12 Sprinkler Dance
@emanthemaan Very optimistic
@DragonFan96 Matt Stafford = MVP Candidate #TrustMe
@bry_paz Unreal. I was like, "Is this even real?!!!?!"
@brentlbryant1 He is a beast!
@imperial_junior Dream come true to be the Seahawks QB.
@vincesaiz1 I do. Hoyer is underrated also.
@RickMirer @HistoricPackers Thanks to Vinny T's injury you had to go rescue the J-E-T-S.
@EMMufc One of the best people you will ever meet anywhere on this planet. Love that kid!
@rabdelfa So many good teammates. Best part of playing in the @NFL for sure. Very thankful for the older QB's that helped me early on.
@Matt_Wilson206 Away stadium would be Lambeau in the cold. Great stadium!
@muspirit I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn last night. 👨‍⚕️
@EMMufc Orondo, WA
@Gaychel22 My mom raised the 12 flag once, very cool moment.
@bry_paz If you know the whole story-- don't regret that part at all! The throw... not so much. 😳
@realmatthoward He has way too much dirt on me for me to answer that.
@_lionheart41090 Relationships
@emosqueda53 Not today
@PSchrags This was an actual question posed to me by a head coach (I assume you know the story) #IfNotAskNateB
@PSchrags All 3 could win their 1-on-1. #NoDefenseForThePerfectThrow
@SeaProps I've never finished it.
@isthatsol Most definitely!
@a_bydalek I like Glennon, he has a future... but Trubisky is special.
@rossnelson17 Cedar Planked Salmon 🐟
@EvanonHB Once upon a time, very true. He helped me more than I could've ever helped him though.
@tjrueve Underrated toughest DC to prepare for would've been Clancy Pendergast.
@jackets97 Throwing Touchdowns! It's an unbelievable feeling. Trust me.
@ctylerbooth Hoping for the best with him, he is a very hard worker-- I'm sure he is doing all that he can.
@VinnAYE Many to choose from but somehow winning that Thursday Night game while sick in Houston... powerful experience. 🙏
@crissy_froyd He might be a cat person. 🙄
@abrotherston Yes, a bunch of guys I played with still there... Kam, Earl, Bennett to name a few.
@BesseBoy Nope!
@DiorNFLPA Kyrie!  🍀
@dmaxjak I have tremendous respect for coaches and the sacrifices they make, a lot harder to coach than players realize.
@BCCheechees What sport are you talking?
@candysizzle Bronx Tale
@AndyEide Weird question... very weird.
@colewagoner I almost died and my family almost owned @nbc.
@realaaronlee The people.
@thepete2011 Awesome!!!
@jgiuliani7 Tough to choose.  @ San Diego week 17 in 2003 (I think) was fun regular season game that gave us our identity on offense.
@ChadEWright @judybattista I love his book choices. I think his mom is the best reader in the family though.
@HistoricPackers @zaksheskyman Anything to hide a receding hairline! 🙄
@zaksheskyman @HistoricPackers NASCAR-ish hat 👍
@AaronQ13Fox @Hooters I just found those t-shirts the other day. #HolmgrenWay

@Avid_Pacer 3 man rush with extra defenders in coverage like last time would've been better plan!
@juicewop12 That wouldn't surprise me either!
@StuckOliver @ESPNNFL They better figure out how to cover AB then!! 😳
@CodyWheeler @ESPNNFL Educated guess. 🤔
@ESPNNFL I don't like when this happens.. too late for me to change my guess?

@Bham_Insider I'm just here so I won't get fined.
@DiorNFLPA Great to see you Dior!
@ZachGears That's fair. But in 2016 that is still going to be a penalty.
@ZachGears Might not be fair to defenders, tough play but still a penalty.
Missed that call.
Face mask came off!

@titanup86 Great win. Should've lost, KC iced the kicker. Great win.
@damienwoody You know that happens. Just takes 1 guy. 😕
@thelukerodgers 👏👏
@VU_All_Access @pookhahare Nope. Got lucky because they iced the kicker. Better to be lucky than good.
@HomerSakai Agree!
@VU_All_Access @pookhahare Incorrect.
@Aaron_Greenlee @LRiddickESPN Agree!
@niilodon Unreal!
The chart in Tennessee must say "Go for 2 when you shouldn't so you can have a more epic 53 yard game winning field goal on the road".
Should've used the "When to go for 2" chart!!!! https://t.co/IZ8VWIBosC
