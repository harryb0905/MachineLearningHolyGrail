Mainstream media flashed Trump, then trashed Trump, now they're aghast at Trump. They were wrong start to finish.
A repudiation of Obama and a smack down for Democrats. America chose hatred and revenge over love and justice.
Racism, sexism and classism were given the GOP seal of approval last night. He won, but at what cost to the country?
I see our true colors shining through, and I don't mean red, white and blue.
Democrats ran an elitist candidate in a populist election. @BernieSanders is somewhere crying.

The truth is that Black life in this country does not have the same value as white life in this country. #Figureitout
We keep looking at the issue of distrust between citizens and cops as a political issue. #moralleadership #truth
We are lacking the moral leadership we need to address a moral issue.
It's not either/or, it's both/and. Cops have to respect citizens and citizens have to respect cops. Stop scapegoating #BLM.
It's one thing to call the cop killers "vicious and despicable" but we don't reserve that rhetoric for killer cops.
#GOP and @SheriffClarke are scapegoating; that's what people tend to do when they don't want to address the real issues.
Somebody has to stand up with courage, conviction, and commitment to try to make our republic what it should be.
#BLM isn't anarchy. If that's the case, the Boston Tea Party was anarchy and we wouldn't be here without it.
When do we get around to valuing the sanctity, humanity, and dignity of Black life? That's why we have #BLM protesting.
Political sycophants advancing simple slogans &amp; rosy rhetoric but can't get to a real convo about what's at stake in America @SheriffClarke

It's important that #POTUS visit MN and LA. He shouldn't misread the pain of Black folk. Read more in @USATODAY https://t.co/yLrs97YDYw
When #GeorgeBush didn't get to NOLA quickly enough, we raised holy hell. But #POTUS can bypass Louisiana &amp; Minnesota and get a pass? Not.
On matters of race #POTUS tends to be so measured that he comes across as milquetoast, so carefully calibrated that it feels cold.
Even if #POTUS does decide to go to Minnesota and Louisiana after Dallas, it's an afterthought, not original intent.
