@NSDelToro @flip_a_bit @radpad we implemented positive pay in June as safeguard bc some checks were being stolen and forged
@NSDelToro @flip_a_bit @radpad you're right. It was posted on Reddit. Must be true

If you want to try #PayWithRadPad  @philpostro don't send fake payments through. We'll catch you every time
@philpostro @radpad second you were given proper notification in an email that your account was suspended for sending a fake payment

@rayhanrafiq what i posed is a question about renters paying 15% of their yearly rent to a broker/agent.
@rayhanrafiq obviously you believe that. you're business is based on the demand from agents and brokers.
@rayhanrafiq again. i think that model will go away. and while it certainly works in nyc, i don't think renters will pay in other cities.
@rayhanrafiq supply of what? renters don't need human beings to show them apartments. technology can do that and it will.
Do renters really want to pay 15% for someone to show them an apartment? I don't think so. http://t.co/UMPUimxQzy)
