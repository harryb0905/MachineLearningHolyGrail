Democrats are sitting there in the Senate thinking that by forcing Franken to resign they are taking a stand and showing that Democrats have a zero tolerance for sexual harassment. That will NOT be the lesson learned here.

Has there ever been a more inconsequential #VPdebate ? #MikeWho #TimWho
Why do they even pretend by shaking hands? #debatenight
Trump truly has diarrhea of the mouth. That was just a spastic random spewing of crap completely unrelated to the question  #debatenight
That was a genuine laugh from Hillary. How wonderful to see a genuine laugh. #debatenight
OK .. I take it back Hillary. You’re right. I was wrong. Just stand there. He’ll bury himself! You’re right! #debatenight
Hillary’s stare to the camera was her saying to folks at home “Are you hearing this bullshit?” #debatenight
Countdown to Trump attacking Hillary on Libya…… #debatenight
Whoa Trump! Don’t talk shit about 400lb people sitting on their beds! They are your voters! #debatenight
That’s nice in theory… but she needs to start fighting fire with fire. get pissed at him! All of your supporters are! And you look WEAK https://t.co/TsMBq5MzoQ

YES HILLARY!!!! —— I agree! I love having inexperienced politicians in office. That's why I get my mechanic to do my taxes. #debatenight
She thinks looking calm makes her look presidential. And I think she’s right. But voters don’t seem to care about presidential. #debatenight
Unfortunately, Hillary looks typical and he looks like something new. I think by comparison she looks fake. That worries me. #debatenight
Is Trump taking notes!??? No way! He’s probably doodling something. #debatenight
Hillary needs to interrupt him a bit more. Not the way he is interrupting. But she can’t just stand there when he spouts BS. #debatenight
But who the hell would ever want to stay there now??? https://t.co/NCbwDfj6LA
He’s owning all of the horrible things he’s done and wearing them as badges of honor. Is this real life? #debatenight

@Ramsey1975 or was it the policies that increased the GDP by +15%? Or the stock market performance by +175%
@Ramsey1975 @BarackObama You mean the ones that added 14 million jobs? Or the ones that got 20 million more people health insurance?
@Hardlanding @ArsenioHall Certainly not opposing him becuz he is Republican. I like Republicans. It's because he unstable and unqualified.
.@HillaryClinton's nomination has been expected so much that we've taken for granted just how much tonight is BIG DEAL! #history #herstory
This #DemsInPhilly convention is killin it! I think it's doing all exactly what @HillaryClinton needs when it comes to reintroducing her!! 🎉

Will these new justices also uphold Article 12 of the Constitution? https://t.co/JctbwpB5uP
Be careful with all of that infrastructure talk @realDonaldTrump .. you're coming perilously close to embracing a Democrat policy!
So @realDonaldTrump who's gonna protect the LGBT citizens from the hatred of DOMESTIC violence????
I don't think saying the word "plan" actually constitutes a plan. 🙄
I could have sworn that a few yrs ago all of the problems in in the world were Obama's fault. Now all of the sudden it all Hillary's?
Uh... Does @realDonaldTrump not realize that crime control (homicides, etc) is not under jurisdiction of President/federal govt? #GOPinCLE
.@IvankaTrump gives a beautiful speech without once trash talking @HillaryClinton - it can be done! Who knew #GOPinCLE ??
This music though!! 😳 Sounds like some battle scene from a WWII movie. 😳
Colorblind? How would Latino immigrants feel about that claim? Or Judge Curiel? Or Muslims? Really? Thats laughable. #RNCinCLE
Listening to #GOPinCLE, you'd think @HillaryClinton was the Antichrist come to destroy America deliberately &amp; eat your kids - #givemeabreak
Do @NCGOP and @PatMcCroryNC still think #HB2 isn't harming #NC now that @NBA has officially yanked the 2017 All-Star Game? #ThisIsNotAGame

#IWantToBeFree to marry who I choose! #GOPinCLE

#IWantToBeFree to believe I can send my child to school without the worry someone will get his/her hands on a gun and attack #GOPinCLE
#iWantToBeFree to be trapped inside a wall... Oh wait... That contradicts ... Nvm. 🙄
Women say #IWantToBeFree to make choices about my own body and medical care. #GOPinCLE
Those "local values" ur talking about @tedcruz -- Can you talk to @NCGOP and @PatMcCroryNC about that. They seem to disagree #hb2
#IWantToBeFree to vomit every time @tedcruz pretends to be defending gays and lesbians! #GOPinCLE
"I want to be free" to believe I can send my child to school without the worry someone will get his/her hands on a gun and attack #GOPinCLE
"I want to be free" to vote for my leaders without gerrymandering or obstacles in my way because of my race or income level #GOPinCLE
"I want to be free" to marry who I choose! #GOPinCLE
What parent asks their 8 year old child "What if this is the last time you ever hug and kiss me?" -- the bullshit is deep tonight. #GOPinCLE

This is all so fake and disingenuous and self serving and totally for show that it's nauseating.

Not sure how @andersoncooper is holding it together covering the #OrlandoShooting today. Some very powerful interviews on @CNNnewsroom
No @AGPamBondi not "because they were in a bar at the wrong time" They were gunned down because they were gay n a gay bar! #CNN @CNNnewsroom

@Hallofr808 @voxdotcom Yeah... I usually change the subject when I've lost the argument too.
@DeirdreHarvey6 @realDonaldTrump especially the "poorly educated" - Feel safe!
@hagman3926 @MeghanMcCain @americanowradio The handle actually SAYS "radio" and yet still you "wouldn't watch it"? Please do try to watch! 🙄
@jodymcbrayer Are you trying to say that this was NOT a homophobic, gay-targeted attack?
@Hallofr808 @voxdotcom And Saudi Arabia doesn't let women drive, so us paying them less and ignoring when they get raped is fine. Good point
@karatelawyerguy My facts on legal discrimination in FL are absolutely correct... as is the first half of your Twitter profile description.
@nanibrum He was an american, born and raised - influenced by decades of antigay laws and sentiment from American leaders and politicians.
@AlshowaierNouf I don't disagree. I think you chose to miss the point.
Great deal of respect for @CAIRNational and other Islamic leaders for making statements condemning violence. It's a shame they have to.
@afraidofalling @sometumblrthing no  the fear-mongering and ignorance persists. https://t.co/f2QN5VeExr
@randydeabay Diseases that they test EVERY blood donation for regardless. Spare me your homophobia disguised as medical expertise.
@1Dtightjeans not just one gay man. It was a global statement. All gay men in America are banned from donating blood.
Preach! https://t.co/gyt2ewl4AV
@richpink nope. Whole country.
A gay man who survived this awful #Orlando hate crime is not legally allowed to donate blood to his friends injured in the same attack.
.@realDonaldTrump Where is YOUR acknowledgement that this attack directly targeted gays? Will you call 4 discrimination protections 4 LGBT?
@mushystarr Fine. Agreed. But it was still SPECIFICALLY directed at gay people. That's a hate crime.
@seanw65 Not the wrong time! This idiot killed people because they were gay! This country still allows discrimination for the same reason!
@brooklynmiles66 In over half of US states, there are not.
A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL have his landlord evict him in FL (and many other states) simply because he is gay.
I worried that people would begin to copycat mass attacks on LGBT people after #Orlando and now it didn't even take 24 hours apparently.
A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.
Ok @cnn. This MIGHT have been Islamic terrorism. But it DEFINITELY was a targeted attack on gays! And you're totally downplaying that! 😒
This shooter was Islamic. But father says he was "not religious". He was pissed that he saw two men kissing. This was a hate crime! #Orlando
Beautifully written and powerful reminder by my friend, Wayne Riggins https://t.co/zNPiq8iQsJ
.@realDonaldTrump This was a hate based attacks on gay people! Do you have the courage to call it that? #Orlando
Dont take the easy path of calling it just "Islamic terrorism". This was an attack on LGBT people! Yet LGBT are still not a protected class!

Rubio wants to keep Trump from getting delegates to win outright. Rubio won't win a brokered conv. but can claim "win" and be GOP "savior"
I don't think @marcorubio is even running to win anymore. I think he's only running to try to stop @realDonaldTrump from getting the nom.
If I told you I wanted to take away your $50 bill so that I could give you a $100 bill, would you be upset with me?
My BFFs mom is voting for Hillary b/c she says Bernie wants to "take away Obamacare"!! This kind of BS makes me dislike Hillary. #smdh

"Cruz lies, but at least they are reasonable lies." What does that mean? That's not what you were saying last night, Mr Trump!
Doh! He's recounting stories with specific people he has "met"!! He IS turning into a real politician!! #campaigning101

It sounds mean and bully like, yes. But these attacks Trump's throwing at Rubio are going to work. He's effectively painting him as weak.
Rubio had a good night last night. That should have been the story. Gotta hand it to @realdonaldtrump. He knows how to take the story back!

@huitecouture Disturbing... as in its disturbing that he looks in charge.
I'm going to need to learn Spanish so I can watch this woman @MariaCeleste on @Telemundo. I'm sorta loving her. #GOPDebate
"Go ahead. Don't get nervous." Trump is such the Alpha on the stage that Cruz and Rubio both look like kids. The whole picture is disturbing
MERCY!!!  SHUT UP!!! Everyone else on stage is acting like a kindergartener, and Carson goes and tattles like a preschooler! #GOPDebate
Come on now Rubio, say something other than "This is not a real estate deal". I know you practiced it, but that was 4 times, man. #GOPDebate
Trump is right. I'm pretty sure my dog could beat @tedcruz #GOPDebate
The @realDonaldTrump : "It's embarrassing for me to say I'm beating him so badly" ... you sorta gotta love him a tiny bit! #GOPDebate
Is Rubio adopting Trump's scowl? #GOPDebate
@believeinxfiles I'm pretty good at everything! :-)
@jgaryp He's over on the side of the stage. But i think he may be asleep.
I don't know @MarcoRubio can give @realDonaldTrump crap for repeating himself when Rubio is a nothing but a memorized script. #GOPDebate
@andrechouravong Not with one of these crazies! haha
Come on @wolfblitzer You're moderating! Not Cruz. take charge man! #GOPDebate
I am LOVING these @politico vines! https://t.co/RRxbC1S7L4
When Rubio smiles at his own digs, he looks like a little kid who is so excited that he scored a goal in soccer. How cute. #gopdebate
@matthewharden "A Black"? There's "a black"? Really? #pointproven
@ALT_PROTOCOL is being a dumbass a mental illness too? Maybe I should see your psychiatrist!
"Extra rights"? Go back to sleep @RealBenCarson. #GOPDebate
How did @JohnKasich just say he wants to pray for me to "change" my "behavior" and yet he is still the sane one on this stage? #GOPDebate
I'm sure Telemundo is very happy to hear that Trump is no longer fighting with Univision. ha ha #GOPDebate
"We are the party of diversity" Ok. That made me chuckle. #GOPDebate
Ha ha. #soundbite Marco Rubio ... every singe one of your lines is so obviously rehearsed. #GOPDebate

OMG!!! What am I watching??? This is a mud fight!! I am expecting audience members to start throwing chairs very soon! #GOPdebate
Someone needs to control this audience!!! This is ridiculous! The audience is getting more airtime than anyone. It's like a WWE audience!
Did @realDonaldTrump just insult @LindseyGrahamSC in front of the senator's home state Republicans?!?! #dumbmove
Oh wait @tedcruz did you just get your facts wrong and get your butt handed to you?
You better read that script again @marcorubio !! Man... does he never learn? That was totally memorized!
@SenatorBurr The people DID have a say! Elected a pres in 2012 and chose Pres Obama 2 nominate vacancies for 4 years. That's how it works
Thank you @SenateMajLdr !  There is no better gift you can give the Democratic candidate than to make the #2016race about the Supreme Court

"If u vote 4 Donald Trump as a Republican, u're buying a ticket on the Titanic AFTER u saw the movie." Ha ha. I sorta love @LindseyGrahamSC
How you gonna breathe a "sigh of relief" when no one has called the race for you yet!?! 😳
Why is this dude still running his dry mouth?
Hey @realDonaldTrump, remember that time you made me come in 2nd place? Doesn't feel good does it? 😉 I do still love ya, but #karmasabitch
I love hearing these teenagers arguing on @MSNBC. So much passion while not having ANY IDEA what they are talking about! #democracy inaction
Just to give some perspective... with 20% of precincts reporting, I was winning! Haha. Let it get ahead of ourselves.
This #IowaCaucus coverage on @CNN and @MSNBC and @FoxNews is essentially #politicalporn for me.
Watching #IowaCaucus coverage with @thaynejasperson reminds me of how much we MUST fix public schools in the US. #thinkstrumpisincongress
Thomas Kail deserves 2 Emmys for #GreaseLive tonight... one for direction and then another one for direction, just because it was that good!

Of course, as soon as I tweet that someone would go and screw up the mics. Come on #GreaseLive - but still really impressed
I really wanted to be able to talk smack about this #GreaseLive on @Fox but man they are really doing an incredible job! Really well done!
Some1 oughta tell @marcorubio that when, all of the sudden, u start bringing #God up in every interview when u haven't b4, no one buys it.

Ok. That military mom showing up on @americanidol just tore me the hell up! Wow! I've got chills. THAT is good TV!
When you really love something you only want the best for it, and you have high expectations from those you know are capable of it.
We're all more critical of the things we care about most.
When your favorite team that you've cheered for for years happens to play a shitty game, you're absolutely allowed to be upset about it.
Now that #Raleigh has shown out and these judges have put me to sleep! I'm changing over to watch my girl @tyrabanks on @black_ishabc
Leave it to the contestants from #Raleigh NC to totally make tonight's show worth watching!!
It's VERY clear now that @SimonCowell was the reason @AmericanIdol was a hit. I've watched root canals more entertaining than these judges.
Oh good Lord... those boring ass responses from the judges!? Where is Simon when you need him!? That guy need a hook to pull him off stage.

They know what is possible when you work together. They represent the true values of North Carolinians.
As I traveled across the district last week, I met so many ppl who still believe that our brightest days are ahead of us.
It seems that the loudest, most extreme voices get all the attention. And that needs to change.
Some people think that’s too optimistic.  And I can understand why. There is so much cynicism and negativity in politics today.
When I began my campaign for Congress, I said that I believe people in my corner of North Carolina want a Congressman who listens to them.
