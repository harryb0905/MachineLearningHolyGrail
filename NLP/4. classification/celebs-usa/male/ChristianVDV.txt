@J_Buzzard see you there man. Thanks.
@BenBostrom anytime dude.
Congrats @danmartin and the entire @Ride_Argyle. Team effort from start to finish. We've been talking about today for a while now. #guts
Heart pounding
Have to give the upper hand to @DanMartin86  in the sprint today. But after a stage like today, all bets are off.
@daniellloyd1 I am with you.
Quintana's lack to completely commit is great for @DanMartin86. #biased
@MonteDirks attacking with the boys.
Movistar is taking Porte out of the race but making it "easy" for Froome. They need to attack. Like now.
Don't forget about the race within the race today. There will be many riders racing flat out just to make the time cut today.
Carnage. Saxo missing the boat. @Ride_Argyle and Movistar making this the best stage in the last 20 years.
Long downhill now and stretch till the next climb. Richie needs to come back but Movistar is not letting that happen. @Ride_Argyle crushing.
Caution to the wind today. This going to be an amazing day of racing. @Ride_Argyle
Expected display of dominance today by Froome Dog and Richie. If today was rough for some, tomorrow will be ugly. Congrats Sky.
Thank you for all the well wishes, I'm humbled beyond belief. Relieved not to be suffering anymore but absolutely gutted to be leaving.
Acceptable in the 80's.

However, the riders still make the race. It was still dramatic and the fact is, Tom Boonen is a champ no matter what roads you race on.
Keep the laps in the beginning or the middle of the race. But keep the traditional final in place. Muur, Bosberg etc...

I will be looking for @dzabriskie in his Borat swimsuit on Els Angels.
Racing past my house today. Once a year we get to race on roads that we actually know. Might need security to hold all the Americans back.
Congrats @mattgoss1986. The mvp has to be Scarponi after bridging to the first group, by himself!
Great race today

I want to go by boat to every race.
Everyday, on the way home to the hotel, we have to drive up this massive climb on the tt course that we will do on Saturday. #sickandtwisted
Now I know where Oman is.
@suffolkcycles He did talk about bees. However he was trying to explain what @BenBostrom was talking about. Bees,Veganism etc.
@dzabriskie asked me today if I drove home from Mallorca. I told him that I didn't own a "bitchin' Camero" anymore. He was serious.
I think I may have the honor of riding with @dzabriskie today! I am one of the lucky few.
Heinoh!
Good bike practice today in Mallorca. Very happy with the form and the the team. However, I just read about Ricco. #speechless #goodriddance

@jimmohan Yeah dude, I DO have an impostor on facebook. I have finally made the big time.
1,953,337 gallons of eggs. Or 3 point something or other olympic size pools worth of egg. If I am wrong, blame Robbie.
You could "egg" every house, twice, maybe more, in the US with those eggs.
500 million eggs. Really, what is the diameter of a half billion egg omelette? Would it fill our pool?
Jacky Bobby wins in Eneco! Belated congrats to Svein and @Greghenderson1 for their respective wins too. Ok, @allandavis27 too.

Go @ryder_hesjedal! Moving up to 6th.
This is gonna be good. How many spots can change today. Ryder, Menchov, going up. Andy just blazed the first time check, can he keep it up?
Pretty cool seeing Garvey in the car behind @lancearmstrong  Book ending the TT car rides.
