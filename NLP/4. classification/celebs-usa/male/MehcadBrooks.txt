The fact that @realDonaldTrump called @MichaelCohen212 a rat. First off that’s how Mafia bosses talk not presidents. Second, rats are snitches. Snitches are disliked by criminals because they tell the truth about crimes committed. If Rats were liars then there would be no anger
Ever notice a pattern with @realDonaldTrump he claims anyone he sees as a threat is doing what he is actually doing. Cohen “lying to protect his family” nope #POTUS pretty sure that’s what you’re doing. Hillary “colluding with Russia” no that’s going to be you and yours again.

Umm Brett if you like coaching girls basketball “More than anything you’ve done in your whole life” the Supreme Court is not for you. There’s a job for that. It’s called a basketball coach.
@JCallahanNCIS Touché
So lemme get this straight Brett. If that is your real name. You didn’t enter sexual assault appointments in your calendar in the 80s? Well then I think that clears it up.
I don’t think I even knew 65 women in high school. But who has not assaulted 65 women. I’ll wait.
Did he just liken beer drinking to sexual assault? I would wait for SNL to do this skit but I don’t think there’s going to be anything unexplored after his monologue.
I haven’t seen worse acting since my high school play. Kavanaugh monologue series. Cry, sniffle, water pour, water drink repeat.
He’s crying about his dad’s calendar? If a woman was crying like this at a hearing all we would hear about is how unstable she is. I think Brett is not stable enough to sit on the highest court.
All this I was in high school and it was in 1983 isn’t holding water. Didn’t Bill Cosby just go to prison for things he did as far back as in the 60s?
Coming into a hearing that you’re accused of aggressive sexual assault aggressively and unstable is probably something he’ll regret.
Kavanaugh translation: “How dare you call me out on doing whatever the hell I want?”
Stand with Dr. Ford. Believe victims when they exhibit credibility. No one would come out with this information thirty five years later and have to suffer what she’s had to recently (death threats) Just to sabatoge his career. It happened.  #IStandWithChristineBlaseyFord

@SpinCity75 @united Long story - they threatened to call the police on me because I asked for them to explain why I couldn't use their lounge. Check IG stories
Is that too much to do @united?
What @united put me through was one of the most embarrassing things of my life. And I didn't deserve it. I'm only asking for an apology.
@united You spoke to someone who works for me and offered to call to make a formal apology and now nothing...you treated me like a criminal.
@united You reached out Wednesday to set a call for Thursday. It's now Friday.
Waiting on our call @united the one you promised to have two days ago. #unitedneedstobefair
Alt Right hero Steve Bannon resigning from the WH in the wake of Nazi-gate makes about as much sense as ketchup and mustard on cereal.

@brandonmiguel55 @ColorOfChange Stating your opinion about what you think is fair doesn't answer my question.
#DylannRoof killed more people than the two Boston Bombers combined. 3x times as many. Why is he not considered a terrorist? @ColorOfChange
#DylannRoof is a terrorist and should be treated like one. Period.
@ClouDesignz @SoLilMuchTweets @PiscesChikk So what if he hated all people with brown and black hair? Is that then terrorism? Or if it were some other arbitrary device of division.
@ClouDesignz @PiscesChikk He wanted to insight a race war. He thought all whites should kill blacks. Sounds like ISIS if you replace black with American or infidel.
@LuisVelazVFL Then why classify a Muslim doing what he did as terror? We cannot have blatant discriminatory justice. That's the antithesis of justice
THANK YOU https://t.co/WNQJojRTa0
@DAVID_LEE_RGV If you have to ask...
@AmyAzeEng No thank you. Is not about Dylann Roof. It's about people who will do it in the future. Thur should know what theyre doing is terrorism.
@josephcbow He said he was inspired by the KKK. We haven't labeled the KKK a terrorist organization but shouldn't we?
@JEWJETSON @TalentDisplay I care. Because it's important.
@DemonsDaughter It was for political and sociological gain on sacred ground. Isn't that what ISIS just did in Egypt?
@Liberty_Czar I have. Go on and explain.
Why isn't #DylannRoof being tried as a terrorist? What he did was terrorism. What's the difference if you use a truck or a gun?

If government cannot explain dropping 16 years of bombs in one place without any foreseeable end then they need to stop doing it right now.
Pentagon: since war on terror began acts of terrorism increased 4500%. We've bombed Middle East relentlessly for 16 years. What's the goal?

@BradDillon17 I'll wait...
@BradDillon17 I'll ask again. Which nations are not Islamic? Should Belgium be banned since much of the euro attacks were planned there?
@BradDillon17 yep Iraq is dangerous because there's a WAR there. That's pretty dangerous.
@McKotney that's exactly my point. It wasn't a quote and he used quotations to act as if the ban is not discriminatory. 🤷🏾‍♂️
@McKotney quoting who?
@BradDillon17 @MsBigBrother18 which nation on the ban is not an Islamic one?
@POTUS is telling Americans that they cannot visit their own families if their families happen to live in a " "banned" country. Demagogue.

Russia is doing what's best for Russia. But why is our senate doing what's best for Russia?
What's the most distressing is that our senate knew about this in Sept and refused to tell the American people. I'm not mad at Russia.
But 2 question the CIA for going 2 the senate with the intel seems to be demeaning of the office of POTUS. It's not like the CIA went public
Hundreds of billions of not trillions at stake
Im interested to see how this plays out
On Russia it's clear we have watched a coup of the American government by Russia and certain corporations that stand to make $ with them
Obama has sanctions on Russia because of its illegal seizure of Crimea all of which Trump can lift on day one. If he does lift the sanctions
If we do nothing we can guarantee that other nations will involve themselves in our elections via hacking.
So there's no harm in him accepting the intel and Obama and Trump both go after Russia because we KNOW they committed a crime by hacking
Is not reliable because it doesn't make him look good will cause a much larger issue with the intelligence community Trump won't be recalled
Trump questions the CIA and FBI's intelligence and says he does not believe it. This is becoming frightening. A POTUS saying our intel...
16 of our intelligence agencies have now confirmed that Russia and likely North Korea actively meddled in our election by hacking.
