Conceptually I think it's a great idea, the interviews were fascinating and the show did not allow us the time to get everything in. I did this show to capture these amazing stories from the creators, and hope to have the podcasts back to you soon. (2)
While I deeply appreciate the response to #HistoryofHorror on @shudder, I was very surprised they released a podcast of my full interviews without ever having told me about its. Not only did I never hear them, I learned about it when you all did. (pt 1)
Awesome , thank you Rob! Had the time of my life making it. Glad you enjoyed it. https://t.co/Zk5yLPdeZM

@SHO_TwinPeaks &amp; @GameOfThrones definitely cheered me up. That said, still feeling like a zombie.
You can trace a direct line from NOTLD to Get Out. And...Romero created the modern zombie. The infectious bite. Shoot the head. Everything.
Very few others in cinema were taking such risks. He was both ahead of his time and exactly what cinema needed at that time.
Romero used genre to confront racism 50 years ago. He always had diverse casts, with Duane Jones as the heroic star of NOTLD.
Just heard the news about George Romero. Hard to quantify how much he inspired me &amp; what he did for cinema. Condolences to his family. ❤️

My only real problem with #TwinPeaks is that I can't stop talking like Wally Brando. And that's not even really a problem.
Was it Ronette Pulaski by the fireplace? Is she the American Girl?
Fun fact: I worked as PA on Central Park West and used to fan out daily to @madchenamick about #TwinPeaks and she was always cool abt it!❤️
