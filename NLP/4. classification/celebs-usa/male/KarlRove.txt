Politicization of nominee fights by stressing outcomes, not qualifications, is why trust in the judicial system has declined.
Hunt doesn’t have right solution for Dems, i.e. broaden opposition to Kavanaugh by demanding liberal outcomes on redistricting, affirmative action, voting rights, etc., from the Supreme Court.
Hunt identifies why Dems are in a bad spot on SCOTUS but leaves out Sen. Harry Reid’s perfection of obstructionism on judicial nominees for lower courts during 43’s terms. https://t.co/t0dfFa6Peq

Thanks for following along with my updates tonight. I'll be joining @megynkelly shortly with more #SOTU reaction.
Left out of Obama's agenda: dealing with the debt, deficits/Medicare, Social Security going broke. #SOTU
"I know, I won both of them" reminder of how hard edged Obama is. Reminder of "I won" comment in '09 &amp; jarring w/ calls to work together.
This SOTU w/ proposals he knows are DOA evidence he plans to spend next 2 years attacking GOP, playing politics. #SOTU
6 years in, he promises to work w/ Republicans to make country stronger. Heard it before but haven't seen him do it. #SOTU
"A better politics" might be possible if he started appealing to basic decency, not fears, stopped demonization, starting uniting. #SOTU
He has governed as if he only cares about liberal America and questioned beliefs, motivations of any who disagree w/ him. #SOTU
All he wants to do is get prisoners out of Gitmo. He's blind to threat to US this represents. #SOTU
And deal with China not submitted to congress for approval. Shame! #SOTU
US steps up war on coal &amp; cars NOW while China promises to think about doing something (maybe) decades in future. #SOTU
Obama Asia Pacific policy sounds good, but is not backed with resources, focus. #SOTU
How many deadlines busted by Iran before POTUS reverses position, starts putting pressure back on? #SOTU
Not a word from POTUS about Cuban democratic dissidents &amp; freedom for Cuban people. #SOTU
Certain Putin laughing @ claim US "upholding principle bigger nations can't bully the small by opposing Russian aggression." #SOTU
Obama's "smart kind of leadership" is losing Yemen tonight while JayVee ISIL slaughters children, Taliban threatens Afghanistan. #SOTU
He couldn't get Dem Congress to "stop rewarding companies keeping profits abroad" in 2009..2010? #SOTU
Doubt Obama can get 1/4 of Dems to back Trade Promotion Authority. Test of how serious he is: campaigning or working over Dems on TPA. #SOTU
At current rate of creating 17k manufacturing jobs, will take about 8.5 years to get back to # of manufacturing jobs in 12/2007. #SOTU
"New generation of veterans," but not a single word about fixing problems at VA. #SOTU
Let's have DC run community colleges. They do so well w/ VA, post office, OBAMACARE web site... #SOTU
CBO says Obama minimum wage hike will cost 500,000 jobs. Unions want it bc their pay is tied in contracts to increases in min. wage. #SOTU
Yeah, "putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets," just like that $2,500 a year reduction in health insurance premiums. #SOTU
"We want everyone to contribute to our success," then he pivots to class warfare. #SOTU
Gov't has been holding back economy. DC has been screwing things up. We'd have been better off if POTUS had tried to do no harm. #SOTU
Middle class economics works? Median household income down, more people out of the labor force. Inequality up, deficit up. #SOTU
Chutzpah: Obama claiming credit for shale revolution happening on private, state lands and not on federal lands or waters. #SOTU
What happened to POTUS claim that businesses don't create jobs?  It took until last April to get back to # jobs America had 12/2007. #SOTU
Well, we've been warned. POTUS will spend rest of year campaigning. #SOTU
Best way to salute courage &amp; sacrifice is to make certain that it was not in vain by winning war against Islamic extremists. Not retreat.
Only free of grip of foreign oil bc drilling up on private, state land. Way down on federal land, in fed waters bc of Obama Admin. #SOTU
Economy may be growing, but it's the weakest recovery in nation's history. #SOTU
What do you want to hear Pres. Obama say in tonight’s #SOTU? Let me know. Will be discussing with @megynkelly around 11 PM ET.

Thanks for following during #SOTU. Tune in to #kellyfile now for more analysis of Obama's speech.
SFC* not SCF. Apologies for the typo.
God bless SCF Cory Remsburg and all like him who don the uniform of the United States and go bravely into harm's way. #SOTU
Sanctions bill kicks in if negotiations fail.  strengthen POTUS hand; provide valuable insurance policy. can't understand y Obama opposed.
Iran has neither halted or rolled back the Iranian nuclear program. Naive and misleading. #SOTU
Iraq would be much different &amp; America safer if POTUS had not blown negotiations 4 residual force there like planned for Afghanistan. #SOTU
Congressional democrats cheers make it appear they're ready to follow Obama in defending ObamaCare. #SOTU
Let's do see if "the numbers add up," Mr. Obama. They haven't so far for your program. #SOTU
9 million: Claims credit for Medicaid sign ups in states that didn't expand Medicaid and claims credit for renewals as new signals. #SOTU
Let's see how many democratic senate candidates act same way. #SOTU
No remorse. No apology to millions who lost coverage because of ObamaCare or have higher premiums, larger deductibles.
He lectures congress about getting rid of Fannie and Freddie after blocking their shutdown. What's his plan?
Interested to see where POTUS thinks he has statutory authority to set up MyRA with federal guarantee without new law.
How many workers for federal contractors make the minimum wage?? This was a teeny tiny burp. #SOTU
So now the federal government is running our high schools, re-designing them? Are not local communities in charge? #SOTU
Of course, he couldn't credit no child left behind. Would've been generous and accurate. W/o NCLB his "race to the top" impossible.
What evidence does POTUS have that CEOs are deliberately NOT giving long term unemployed a fair shot at new jobs?
Is it me or does he seem more bored and detached than usual and a little irritated as he reads his script? #SOTU
Now he's promised to lock up more federal land. Energy production on fed land is down since Obama took office, up on private &amp; state land.
Oh, it was Obama's strategy that opened up the shale revolution &amp; reignited our oil industry. Not entrepreneurs &amp; energy industry he attacks
Trade promotion authority. 1 thing I agree with POTUS about. Of course, he's only 5 yrs late on paying attention to new trade agreements.
At current manuf job creation rate, it'll take about 20 years to get back to # of manuf jobs in dec 07. More manuf hubs won't solve that.
Will he finally "streamline the permitting process" for Keystone XL pipeline to show he's serious about this promise?? #SOTU
So we reform taxes to cut tax rates and spend lots more money?
Guess "whenever I can take steps w/o legislation" depends on whether he thinks he has stat authority 2 do so or just wants 2 take steps.
"Too many working more than ever just to get by." Maybe that's been because of Obama policies.  #SOTU
Congress got budget agreement bc Obama administration was on sideline, not because it was involved. #SOTU
The man who threatened the full faith &amp; credit of US in 2005 now lectures congress on the issue.
More oil DESPITE not because of Obama administration. What gall. #SOTU
8 m new jobs? Doesn't count jobs lost on his watch. Still take 6ms 2 get back 2 # working when he took office. Worse recovery in US history.
Just a few minutes away - what do you want to hear President Obama say tonight? #SOTU
