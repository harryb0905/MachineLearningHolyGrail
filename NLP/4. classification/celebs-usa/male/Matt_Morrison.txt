I‚Äôve just been made aware and seen a video from the set of a film I worked on in China.  My heart is broken to see any animal treated this way.  Had I been on set or known about this, I would have made all efforts to stop this.  I‚Äôve called the producers to express my outrage.
@Lin_Manuel @Richard_Schiff @VAMNit Ahhhhh!  So pumped for you and Vanessa!  REWIND, and try to do it better the second time!! Congrats
Less than a month before my return to Japan.  VERY excited for these shows, and I can't wait to meet many of my fans in Tokyo and Osaka.  Tickets and more info at https://t.co/laWSEbheBe https://t.co/yhx3n0SsUq
Thank you so much, again, for joining this week's live q&amp;a. I appreciate your love and support, more than you can possibly know. Thank you for watching, and talking with me, and pretending to laugh at my jokes. Gotta head to sleep now!! Goodnight! https://t.co/Q6WzR2syWi
@bri_ibarrondo @GreysABC They're both interesting, but it's a lot more challenging playing a bad guy.
@_bbrittanyluv @GreysABC Nope! I think this one was perfect.
@evanxamazing @shondarhimes @GreysABC Overjoyed and honored!
@badluckbritt03 @GreysABC Bad guy for sure!! So challenging but so rewarding.
@Mickey752 @GreysABC Thank you! I really appreciate your support &amp; love! I think Paul so far, because he's a villain but his evil is really subtle. That was a huge challenge.
@Columbo25 @JanineCoyle @GreysABC @NeverlandBway Anything he wants! I hope he follows all his dreams.
@DatosIsabellaC @EllenPompeo Badass!!!
@redick_ulous @GreysABC I think we all know who it was... https://t.co/U8MVppmYlV
@Mickey752 @GreysABC A guy can dream...
@msdynamite1985 @GreysABC Hours! The fake blood felt so weird. I don't know what it's like to be covered in actual blood but I have a feeling it feels just as gross as fake blood.
@to_shepherd @GreysABC If Paul got arrested, that wouldn't undo the damage. At least this way, they might've saved some people with organ donations.
@Maggie091903 @GreysABC  https://t.co/WkKmhcbKzw
@GHD_inPunxPA @GreysABC human. human. human. alien. human. human. human.
@CynthiRose @GreysABC Here's to hoping we can shine a light on this problem even more in the future. I love knowing that we are bringing awareness to the prevalence of domestic abuse.
@greys_liars @GreysABC I also think she has amazing taste in husbands!
@Redvelvetsweet @GreysABC Hah, thank you! I'll tell Revel!
@Kels_The_Dragon @GreysABC I certainly hope there are... https://t.co/LwBJX9BnUf
@mssarfatilea @GreysABC Being surrounded by so many great talents. So many people to learn from on that set!
@WelcomeMySidee @GreysABC Finally, someone gets it! https://t.co/4GEiV7aRM9
@abbyzeis @GreysABC Thank you!
@iqbaltheba @GLEEonFOX Duh!  Always!  Achievement!!!!! Miss you pal!
@carebear_always @GreysABC No, thank YOU! My biggest takeaway is just that no matter who you're working with, you need to sometimes step back and just appreciate the genius as a person who is lucky enough to be standing nearby.
@Redvelvetsweet @GreysABC Yes! I'd love to play some kind of rugged, adventurer type. Or a dad character-- that's my favorite real-life role so far so I think it would be fun on tv!
@greys_liars @GreysABC That's exactly what I thought!
@mssarfatilea @GreysABC Pretending to be a doctor, a teacher, a writer, etc. I love playing pretend every day!
@mssarfatilea @GreysABC The worst, ever!!
@ahamsabemos @GreysABC This one is a current favorite. I felt it today when I opened the fridge for the tenth time and there still wasn't anything good inside... https://t.co/wVHkwDbkMb
@greys_liars @GreysABC  https://t.co/KsCuco3qOi
@mssarfatilea @GreysABC 15!
@cathybrmd @GreysABC The challenge, and the importance of telling this story.
@mssarfatilea @GreysABC No way! They see so much blood. I'm good with the fake blood, for now! https://t.co/7qsJFM8waE
@greysfan @GreysABC Thank you so much!!
@j6nnifer @GreysABC You should expect "a group of ambitious misfits trying to escape the harsh realities of high school by joining a glee club, where they find strength, acceptance and, ultimately, their voice, while working to pursue dreams of their own." No, wait. That's Glee. Oops!!
@dbg431 @GreysABC Not a stunt person!!! Can't even imagine the pain lol
@WeatherGleek611 @GreysABC The best thing was playing a role that was super challenging, I'm a pacifist and I don't have a temper so acting that out was... interesting. My family is really loving Moana right now, and we sing along extra loud to "How Far I'll Go" so that's a favorite. Great drawing, btw!
@Lovatic5HDores7 @GreysABC @sarahdrew That would've been a great idea too-- I like where your head is!
@CynthiRose @GreysABC Thank you for your bravery in sharing your experience. It was difficult getting into Paul's mindset because I'm a big pacifist, but it's important to portray the truth of the situation. Which is that abusive people usually aren't very obvious-- they hide in plain sight.
@mssarfatilea @GreysABC Some surgeries are necessary, so I try not to be!
@HeatherEBD @GreysABC I will try super hard to make sure you don't want to kill me again!
@msdynamite1985 @GreysABC I really hope so!!
@jseelye94 @GreysABC Yes, I loved slamming my head on the ground repeatedly ;) but also, I had a stuntman https://t.co/pmgLfp2ec8
@babybella1978 @GreysABC I'm either a great actor, or a really terrible one... hmmm....
@JanineCoyle @GreysABC I loved playing J.M. Barrie in Finding Neverland because I think we can all relate to feeling as if we have these dreams we're just meant to follow, and still wanting to keep our childlike sense of wonder and imagination alive along the way.
@anothrmerderfan @GreysABC Meredith! But I could never do better than @EllenPompeo so it's a good thing that didn't happen.
@ahamsabemos @GreysABC I do, I do!
@greys_liars @GreysABC Not at first, but I binged a bunch of it when I got the script. My wife also loves the show so she sat me down and gave me all the info!
@1Band1D1Dream @GreysABC I researched the mindset of abusive people &amp; how they rationalize their behavior. That was most important for me: playing Paul as a real person, even as a villain.
@karevsjosephine @GreysABC I think it ended when it needed to. There's no way you want any characters you love to be stuck in this cycle of abuse. I'm glad he isn't going to cause more damage.
@Maggie091903 @GreysABC Is it cheating if I answer... ALL OF THEM! hahaha
@Lovatic5HDores7 @GreysABC I didn't expect it! Totally thought someone from the hospital was responsible. They got me with that twist.
@cora_nascimento @GreysABC @sarahdrew Beyond excited!
@r_dingler88 @GreysABC So much fun, but also a huge responsibility that I take very seriously.
@ILaffJoy @GreysABC I also hate Paul, but thank you so much!
@surgeonkarev @GreysABC @camilluddington Knowing that when I stood next to her, everyone suddenly realized what a bad actor I was in comparison.
@CamillaLNews @GreysABC I'm just so glad she isn't going to have to be in the same room with Paul ever again.
@mararitzel_ @GreysABC My memory's a little foggy from slamming my head so many times but probably a million...
@KiraCapri919 @GreysABC @shondarhimes The most amazing. No words describe that level of amazing.
@surgeonkarev @GreysABC Pretending to be a doctor! I went home and tortured my family every day, making them ask me about surgery and the hospital lol
@surgeonkarev @GreysABC @sarahdrew Heavenly. Talented. Hysterical. I promise she isn't standing in front of me, telling me exactly what to say... https://t.co/OAX6aSMMHb
@vacountrygirl23 @GreysABC No worries. I honestly have no idea!
@atjogialove @GreysABC I'm just not very musically gifted!! (this is what I tell myself so I don't cry about being left out) https://t.co/9SupcSD3X9
@Sydvaughnfan2 @GreysABC Absolutely!! I'll miss this entire cast. So much fun, professionalism, and talent. Camilla is a superstar of a person, and actor.
Hey, everyone! I'm going to be answering your questions here, live, as @GreysABC airs on the west coast. Hope you're ready to ask, because I'm ready to spill. Let's do this! #GreysAnatomy
@EllenPompeo Thank you for being the best leader #boss https://t.co/TuwV7j0PgS
Had such a great time doing the Q &amp; A after last week‚Äôs Greys Anatomy. What do you think about another one this week?
Suzy Pepper getting her sweet revenge!!  Ahhh...I love you too???! https://t.co/nsxSd68Bi2
That live chat was fun, but I also had to learn about memes tonight and that was maybe the most challenging moment in my entire career. https://t.co/m867icelAV
@itsjeaninemason No, YOU. You were hysterical in this one, I‚Äôm so proud of your journey and talent. You can truly do it all!
@titirestu @DarrenCriss It‚Äôs the best when you get to really flex your skill for a role that‚Äôs very different from who you are, so that‚Äôs a great accomplishment.
Thanks so much to everyone who sent messages! I‚Äôm honored you enjoyed the episode. It‚Äôs great to hear from you, you‚Äòre the reason I get to be a part of this amazing show. https://t.co/pPeImGRXpJ
@swxnqueenmagic Really, I‚Äôm flattered!! Thank you so much for watching
@MamaMitchey @GreysABC Spoiler alert, I ran over Paul.
@caterinaskatic Actually, it was me.
@allieeethomas @GreysABC Everyone‚Äôs trying to get the spoilers and I‚Äôm out here like https://t.co/CYD1VUrpCY
@iheartnetflixx Wonderful!! An amazing person and actor
@Bri1Sky @GreysABC I second this!!! Gimme the ‚ÄòHottest Man in My Living Room‚Äô award, I‚Äôve totally earned it and I‚Äôm the only man in here!!
@swxnqueenmagic I am gonna take this as a compliment  lol
@chadsabby @BethanyJoyLenz We became fast friends, and I‚Äôm such a fan of her singing voice! It was a great experience.
@grantslexie It‚Äôs an incredible honor!
@greyboluda @GreysABC So do I!
@ThePompeoMethod @EllenPompeo LOL tell ‚Äòem!!
@cardiosriggs @GreysABC  https://t.co/Pfms4YVcsp
@styleskiwiwoman @EllenPompeo Everything except type quickly... I feel like I‚Äôve been answering the same tweet forever https://t.co/6OYPAfkksL
@caitlinfrxst A very widespread problem and even with the amount of attention it gets, there‚Äôs still not enough! We‚Äôve all gotta do what we can to shine a light on this. I‚Äôm honored to be part of that.
@spicedchy @GreysABC Thank you!!! I‚Äôm learning about memes, it‚Äôs a difficult time for me. https://t.co/n3qH3K7rDl
@KbethEbrook @GreysABC I could‚Äôve done a million scenes with Kevin Mckidd, I loved the show Rome. And yeah, totally! This felt like a good time for me to reach out, it‚Äôs a heavy episode.
@cardiosriggs @GreysABC You should probably see a doctor about this... sorry I‚Äôm not an actual medical professional
@toodunwithyou  https://t.co/26EH5tVHDA
@titirestu @GreysABC I would be excited, but hope that Revel understands the danger of abuse in all forms, recognizes that Paul‚Äôs behavior is unacceptable, and knows his Papa would never harm another person in that way in real life!
@sophluddington Thank you so much!
@MDCalzona So incredible. This show has been such a big and important part of people‚Äôs lives for so long, which means everyone on set has it on lock. This was a real privilege.
@wilsonxludd  https://t.co/CBboPIeqi2
@paddysholybutt I‚Äôm the person who keeps giving dogs low ratings on @dog_rates, it helps me get into an evil mindset.
@spicedchy @GreysABC Scrubs all day! Best costume ever. https://t.co/bHiM0J5RHj
@miranditty I‚Äôm so glad you enjoyed it, but yeah‚Äî a lot to process, very heavy subject matter, and tons of drama. Hopefully we did justice to the seriousness of domestic abuse.
@merpompeogrey  https://t.co/Xvz3WC0LAx
@cardiosriggs @GreysABC I hope not!! But no spoilers https://t.co/YMGEqrX3WI
@Hudsonwife16  https://t.co/u7WIRZq4B9
@ameliasvlogs @GreysABC @camilluddington Just like you said, amazing!
@merpompeogrey @EllenPompeo She is such a strong &amp; outspoken woman, an incredible talent, and a great person. It was wonderful working with her.
@msdynamite1985 @GreysABC Weird, she followed me all around set and wrote my name in hearts on her copy of the script. #nightmare #justkidding
@toodunwithyou They‚Äôre both fun! But the character I would have the most fun playing is a guy sitting on his couch in a onesie, eating dessert. (I am doing that right now and would love to do the same thing every day)
@paddysholybutt I was so blown away by her skill and hard work. She took an incredibly difficult moment as an actor and made it look so easy. True talent.
@KbethEbrook @GreysABC You know how you‚Äôre never supposed to admit you have a favorite family member, because you love all of them equally? Just kidding. I really do love all my co-stars equally, they‚Äôre amazing people and extremely talented actors.
@wilsonxludd Spoilers??? https://t.co/xmhkw86Dgm
@miranditty For real?? Now THAT‚ÄôS an accomplishment in a show when so much crazy stuff has already gone down
@donna_costa @GreysABC Not to my memory‚Äîthis was a totally new challenge for me.
@dbg431 @GreysABC I kinda hope it‚Äôs the end of him, just because he‚Äôs the worst person ever üòì
@miranditty @GreysABC A ton of research on domestic abuse and the attitudes/beliefs of people who abuse others but manage to justify it in their own heads, mostly.
@wilsonxludd Terrifying! But I was really ready to jump into it.
@miranditty Hah, thank you! I worked really hard on Paul. + I‚Äôm very honored to be part of the discussion around acknowledging victims of domestic abuse and encouraging them to seek assistance. We want them to know they‚Äôre not alone, and they have options.
@WeatherGleek611 @GreysABC 1. Absolutely! I‚Äôve done some voice acting before, and Disney is definitely a dream. Preferably an extremely handsome and charming prince... 2. I received the script and was so blown away by the writing for this character, and inspired by the work and effort it must‚Äôve taken.
@Columbo25 @GreysABC Not in this specific episode but wow, good catch!
@JolexMyHeart It was challenging because I was playing someone so unlike me. And also because I wanted to do justice to this plot line, as domestic abuse is an incredibly widespread problem that we wanted to bring attention to in a way that didn‚Äôt dehumanize or downplay.
@JanineCoyle @GreysABC Thank you so much!
@JolexMyHeart Thankfully, our relationship is the complete opposite of the one on-screen. She was such a professional, I really admire the incredible performance she gave in this ep.
@punkymama11 @GreysABC This was my #1 intent with my portrayal of Paul! Real people don‚Äôt see themselves as villains‚Äîand in Paul‚Äôs case, it really shows you how twisted he is. Once Paul was ‚Äúreal‚Äù to me in that way, he became much less challenging to inhabit.
@CourtMarie_31 @GreysABC I did research on domestic abuse. Abusers tend to believe they‚Äôre in the right, and they convince themselves of it. So we developed that mindset in Paul, because it adds yet another layer to how twisted he is and also helps me see him as a dimensional character to inhabit.
@charaye @GreysABC Big Mood
@Maggie091903 @GreysABC I had to dye my hair darker... not a good look
@JanineCoyle @GreysABC I was actually super up for the challenge! All actors dream of playing a character who‚Äôs totally unlike them.
@Maggie091903 @GreysABC I will always return to the stage, Broadway is my home. #FirstLove #isthishowyouuseahashtag
@MCKel27 @GreysABC Thank you!! üòÖ
@iamLillyC @GreysABC My wife just said the same thing.
@LifebyChellie @GreysABC I‚Äôm always down to break out in song, but I have a strong feeling Paul‚Äôs not a musical theatre kinda guy
@Maggie091903 @GreysABC Both shows are so similar in a way‚Äîvery well-oiled machines, with a lot of context and history. I actually think the biggest difference was in what my character required of me, in terms of playing this awful guy!
@youngfreitas @GreysABC I would, but...no spoilers here! https://t.co/OozFsSvvKY
@shannon_m @GreysABC Hey Shannon! I just wanted to show his own truth in his side of the story. He believes he‚Äôs the good guy, just like a lot abusers. I had to do some research on that angle, so I could inhabit Paul.
So ready to answer of all your questions and discuss this week‚Äôs ep of @GreysABC as it airs on the west coast! See you then! #greysanatomy
