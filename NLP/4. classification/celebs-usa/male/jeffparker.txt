@AshleyVRobinson @OKBJGM I think* it was 86 and 87!
"Shouldn't we prep for this trade discussion before the reporters get here?"  "Nah, I know this stuff cold, Bob. You're Bob, right?" https://t.co/ZvJj2HGtIf
@AshleyVRobinson @OKBJGM do you have either of the Robin issues I drew?
@KurtBusiek @IAmBradWalker @philhester @BrianChurilla "green statue is just what Hulk needs!"  😳
@IAmBradWalker @KurtBusiek @philhester @BrianChurilla or some Romita Raider over the blown up image Kurt mentioned
@IAmBradWalker @KurtBusiek @philhester @BrianChurilla Sal always drew the Angriest Hulk. The one time I got to talk to him on the phone, he told me how he never wanted to pencil, just ink. "But Stan kept bugging me!"
@KurtBusiek @philhester @BrianChurilla ha, I knew that would send you to the basement files
@KurtBusiek @philhester @BrianChurilla you wanna put some money on it?
@KurtBusiek @philhester @BrianChurilla you're all wrong it's Marie Severin
every time I finish explaining to someone how our 'wacky city' reputation is overblown, https://t.co/f3pKivnInj
@HitlerPuncher that stuff is the shit, and anyone who thinks its the same as duct tape needs to be kicked point blank in the scrote
@ianmacewan I've done that.
@JayLender1 @dee_bax awesome! I mean...  "Ninety years ago I was a freak. Today I'm an amateur"
@VaGentlenerd @tomtificate @jessnevins okay, I can hear it now. congrats!
@VaGentlenerd @jessnevins if this were game night, this would be the point where I frustratedly say "Randy Newman!" again trying to make it so
@VaGentlenerd @jessnevins Randy Newman?
@dennisculver @PaulTobin when Spinnaface was here and on duty, we didn't have these Patriot Prayer assholes running around
@dennisculver 'not cuttin' it til I finish me theory on Jack the Ripper'
@fredvanlente it's a much bigger motivator now that my beard is mostly white so what I'm holding over my head is essentially a youth elixir
@jessnevins @VaGentlenerd Leonard Cohen?
@jessnevins "I'm sorry sir, we're not hiring grizzled prospectors at the moment"
I don't know if any of you have ever tried "I'm not cutting this facial hair (or whatever feature) until I'm done with this script no one's paying for" but it kinda works when it's not maddening
🤔 lets look into it https://t.co/rYGorNCiyA
@VaGentlenerd Tom Jones
@danmcdaid it's such a major cheat, of course if you put actual tracks from one of the all time great bands, people are going to have feelings and make it all about whether they love QUEEN or not. The only good thing is that Jurassic Tim played John Deacon
@RobotJQ yes! You'll have an immunity-field around you.
@RobotJQ it laid me out for a week, all I could do was lie around and feel pain
@bigredrobot @TheKyleStarks Woody does not enjoy having kids shout "lookout Andy's coming!" to prompt him to play dead, no matter what the easter egg guides tell you
@Mike2112McKone well lookit Virgil Finlay over here
@RobotJQ not during this virus wave.
@Chris_Kemple it is bulllll-shiiiiit
we should back the Germans up on this and put him on trial here too. https://t.co/Dk7oL86tuI
@HeathCorson because you know Da Public, Joe Lunchpail, Box-office Bob
@kibblesmith you did great and really recovered during that incident
@franzferdinand2 @uzionmain I'm telling you, all the old folks just like the car
@alliamisi @monkey__marc well, I'll work with you in ANY capacity, and at any pace you want.
@monkey__marc @alliamisi I have to second this- you're PHENOMENAL. Even though the story we worked on went nowhere, it was gorgeous and I would drop everything to work with you again Lara!
@LanceArthur Lance, thanks!
@brettwhite @cracksh0t I first loved him in L.A. Story.
Green Book was always going to win because a lot of retired Academy members watched the screener and said "I used to have a Cadillac like that"
@MikeMeltzer It’s really distracting and makes him look even lesser like Freddie
@ghweldon Rodak and his Lugo Men will be on the carpet later
@costa_kout @highway_62 @sandy_jarrell @ben_towle Classic Jarrell
@Ibrahim_M_ I knew that was coming
@pittsed_off @Joe_Hunter it's a flippin' great song. Also fun to watch the video because Grant Morrison is in it
@Ibrahim_M_ My boy outdid himself this time. And he couldn't bring himself to do a tiny spray painted smiley face on the wall
@urbanbarbarian I'll punch 'em while they hold  their cigarettes in that annoying Euro way
@pittsed_off the one you can't remember is NA NA NA.
@BrianChurilla while The Oscars struggle to keep everyone thinking of the entertainment industry as a dream factory full of magic, Wizard World is out there doing their part, giving the public the crass and dehumanizing side of it
@TheMERL @dzhyde @marissadraws did you see
@philhester was it a Rip Kirby?
@AlexJordan406 booooooo
oh hey it's snowing
@DieRobinsonDie Yeah I don't need people to have always acted the way I want. I agree that you don't want to waste the seniority your group has built up, but there's nothing wrong with them catching a reality check on the regular
Just when you think Kareem can't get any better. https://t.co/vbEAjRq0hH
@DieRobinsonDie Everyone really assumes now the choice is either the correct one or oblivion. What's wrong with us splashing an Old Guard with cold water so they stop a minute and assess the modern landscape for a change? While dripping and sputtering some
@jessnevins I am familiar with the feeling
@jessnevins You've found the IT we always knew you would.
@GunwildPrime @Jody_Houser look these plans usually take Voldemort most of the length of a school year to figure out already
@shadipetosky where did you find this guy? I'm looking through his site trying to figure if this is a someone doing a bit. I was nearly certain he's real, but then there's this one line about Brian Doyle Murray on the About page throwing me
@fordgilmore @andykhouri @thatpetewoods @ScottW_inks Kevin torching the doorknob for a minute, now that would be cool.
@PFTompkins it's an envelope joke Carnac the Magnificent would read but even less funny and not helped by Ed McMahon's guffaw.   oh shit now some of these funlovers are going to explain Bill Maher to me, aren't they
@Jody_Houser and it has Harry finding a dead guy (Tennant's dad Crouch) and never finishing his task of telling anyone about it, weirdly
@andykhouri @thatpetewoods @ScottW_inks now you've got me wondering if they were discontinued precisely because of Home Alone showing this use for them. Not that they aren't perfect Home Arson Machines already
@andykhouri @thatpetewoods @ScottW_inks and... HOT!🔥
@thatpetewoods @andykhouri @ScottW_inks yeah it's just the same kind of heating element like on an electric stove, only short and U shaped to fit under a pile of briquets
@ScooterHarris @JerryOrdway @Tommy_Cash2 @DocShaner @bader_diedrich dude you have to finish reading the sentence
@jrobertdeans @JerryOrdway @Tommy_Cash2 @DocShaner @bader_diedrich remember, Mr. Mind gets pretty furious and little worm tantrums
@JerryOrdway @Tommy_Cash2 @DocShaner @bader_diedrich this works completely
@whoisrico a new development from Boj Central!
@eshonborn @MitchGerads @DocShaner aw! You do fine here- maybe we can just all hop on Twitter and tweet-talk a few minutes at the table
@HitlerPuncher I take no pleasure in reporting this
@letsgoayo They are the very bottom of the garbage. Our protest conflicts never get that bad but I feel like if the police keep letting them slide, it's finally going to get real violent.
@letsgoayo -- and there's no way we don't have enough on the main Patriot Prayer people to lock them up. We've got to weed out the goons in our police force who practically encourage it. Presumably that's what Chief Outlaw (actually her name!) was brought in to do
@letsgoayo there was just a town meeting with the Mayor and Police Chief at this church (across the street from Lieber) all about this, everyone is ready for them to be cracked down on. They aren't locals, they come here because it gets the attention they want--
@MitchGerads @DocShaner I'm still baffled by the ones who are genuine fans, not resellers,  but express that by bringing a suitcase full of books to sign when the time could be used talking to this creator instead. I love talking to readers who really know the material.
@TheDrewBrowne that's brilliant.
@ghweldon "He knew how to run with a bit"
@jorm my son assigned us all our profiles so my pic is one of the Queer Eye guys, his sister is the baby from Series of Unfortunate Events and he made himself Steve Harrington from Stranger Things
did you know some people who don't share a Netflix account with families set up the other Who's Watching profiles to tailor to their different personalities
@Devilpig666 I like how you did this woodcut look with the Reaper back there
@PatrickZircher for a while there you could really tell how much Glenn Fabry probably looked to Albright for inspiration
@hotelfred @DaveShelton oops, now I see I was just piling on old Rex. Of course as a kid I preferred him as Dr. Doolittle. Which made no end of confusion when I watched My Fair Lady and he's not the Doolittle of the story
@hotelfred that's great! I bet he sings better than Rex Harrison, too.
@taterpie @highway_62 @mercuryeric true
@taterpie @highway_62 @mercuryeric as was Bret Easton Ellis
@taterpie @highway_62 @mercuryeric because McCarthy said F this, I'm going to go drag a dead guy around for two movies
@highway_62 @mercuryeric even then I thought Harry Dean Stanton wouldn't put up with all this horseshit
btw it's LEGALLY BLONDE- she's Elle!
Watching your kid as the lead in a musical get up on stage and absolutely crush it is a transcendent experience.
@CBCebulski @themikenorton @brentschoonover @sandy_jarrell @Ben_Abernathy @BadWeatherBrew @BegyleBrewing @buttonwoodsbrew This flight is "Cleared for takeoff"
@TheZMage thanks!
@sandy_jarrell @Ben_Abernathy @brentschoonover Brent is over there looking heroically in the fridge, grabbing the can and saying "this one's for Parker"
and besides, that's how everyone from Minnesota eats salad
@sandy_jarrell @Ben_Abernathy @brentschoonover cool! Venus Flytrap beer. I'm waiting till this sickness is clearly in the rearview mirror before I rejoin the beer bros
@LindserAnnie @BenjaminDewey that's the brand inside the brand, right there
@whatthe_shea @ronmarz that sounds like Spirit Airlines, where they charge you for water and anything else you might ordinarily take for granted. They also brag about having the youngest flight crews- but they don't say the "so we pay less!" part out loud
@taterpie and then went on for another ten years!
@taterpie bet she doesn't use a comb to eat HER salads
@taterpie Well she sure doesn't remember anything about how to talk to kids. She comes across as the person who tells the clerks/waitstaff "do you know who I am!?"
@taterpie undoubtedly, but what made that occur to you just now
@Ibrahim_M_ ha, you had it comin
@UNSTBLmolecules it's incredible
I remember the time I told a bunch of school kids I was elected by a million vote plurality, boy did I lose the crowd on that one! https://t.co/vreb3ySltu

@DAvallone @dloehr @DynamiteComics @van_jensen and THEY ARE!
@rusty_game it's a handy 'trick'
@DAvallone @dloehr @DynamiteComics I didn't want to interrupt because you were on a roll, but that was @van_jensen with the great CR adaptation
@Bustronaut @highway_62 from what little I know of it, the Nashville system is set up in a way that makes it near impossible to do anything like country we might like, with an actual band. Those groups have to go the College radio route
@highway_62 it's the most processed over-produced paint by numbers with the same session musicians musical genre, and that's saying something.
@DieRobinsonDie I dunno, I'll be happier when people pick up on my practice of calling the Minnesota one Frau Blucher
@World_Of_Hurt I started to tweet that too, she's the living template for Lois.
@uzionmain those were pretty fun until they weren't
@World_Of_Hurt easily! Like they say in the piece, imagine what a badass she'll be once she can DRIVE.
The best story I've read all week. This girl chasing down hard news stories on her bike, calling bluffs on lying cops, she's a FORCE. https://t.co/IoZBonCN5B
@PatrickZircher what's in the water there!
@PatrickZircher now go start a college and/or a toy company.
@TerriDrawsStuff and you finally got to see what the inside of the Maranatha Church looks like.
@MichaelEmond I was very relieved that no drawings of a stingray turned up in the thing.
@MichaelEmond it seemed fairly straightforward?
@dennisculver ✊
I love today's Google Doodle of Steve Irwin.
@dnwilliams 👍
@jrobertdeans @VaGentlenerd that's why he dunks EXTRA hard
@neilkleid boom-tshhh
@taterpie so much so that I think I forgot it exists
This isn't my Dark Universe plan, exactly... https://t.co/QmlaybzO1j
@brentschoonover @ericjschuster it's time to bring that back, yes
@taterpie @kenlowery that's how I got our first Roomba
@ericjschuster that's the way to look at it!
@kenlowery that's why we bought a used one and had to clean it out, etc. But man, I have never seen something pull dirt like this, it's incredible. I hate that Dyson supported Brexit but he does make good stuff
(quietly)  I could have made the Dark Universe work
@DocShaner ey there Sammy boy
Peter Tork you were the funniest Monkee, and for some reason my kid brain always connected you to Larry Hovis of Hogan's Heroes. RIP
@jesse_hamm Dean Mullaney keeps sliding that art away just are you're going to pick it up
@Peter_Wartman it is really good, it took me forever to read it too. I like the way they did the images and maps. I pretty much lay the blame all over The Pentagon after reading it.
@fordgilmore @RamonVillalobos @Mister_Walsh yes but for me every day felt like Michael's today
@bnacker it's pronounced "Frau Blucher"
@Cattifer @roxypolk isn't CBS all access part of Prime?
@Elisabethf @jesse_hamm Columbo shows you how to do a magic trick
@RamonVillalobos @Mister_Walsh pile on, I've got a great big Villalobos payback coming up this year!
@jesse_hamm @Elisabethf yeah, that's the first one. But my fave is him as the Nazi Magician
@JohnPontoon @ThatWeissGuy I've not!
@Mister_Walsh remember they're going to spend 20 seconds reading that page and you can kick ass tomorrow.
@JohnPontoon @ThatWeissGuy the only bonus would be some weird hallucinatory idea, but I've forgotten all of them within minutes
@kierongillen what I really don't get is when editors bring someone unreliable on board, like it's taboo to call an old boss and ask some questions before entrusting them with the whole team's fates
@ThatWeissGuy this flu has been the worst I've had in years.
@CurtPires Best to you and your family, Curt.
@Elisabethf I still felt he didn't have enough to prove Cassidy hired the weirdo to kill Mickey Spillane
@taterpie I don't think so, if I do I'm just coming up for a day.
@marcandreyko that Julie Andrews? Can SING
@bnacker I haven't thought about Mojo Nixon in a looooong time
@marcandreyko You've not seen Sound of Music? 😳
@Elisabethf I bet they'd just watched The Thomas Crown Affair. I like how in this one Cassidy makes it look like he was framed, he had Columbo going for a while
@Elisabethf ah, this is the one with the split screens
@Elisabethf better than him as a NAZI MAGICIAN???
@TomTaylorMade @JeffKingTV @MitchGerads @UmbrellaAcad I'm pro-POGO
@ARTofCOOP @uzionmain @Kevin_Church this guy was an ex-military dude, he was quite cool with the idea that you wouldn't be a voting citizen unless you served
@ARTofCOOP @uzionmain @Kevin_Church haha, no
Sometimes I think about artist Mitch O'Connell and wonder if he's bummed out at how much his name sounds like the nation's worst Senator.
@sandy_jarrell did you do something pleasant?
@sandy_jarrell yesterday was a day of PAIN. Today was better, hopefully tomorrow I'll have some energy again.
@VaGentlenerd @shutupdougan like riding the "Metro"
@shutupdougan I always love when you post pics of Exorcistville.
@joegross Oh I know better than to watch it again!
@joegross the redeeming quality of Juno is JK Simmons, as always. I was thinking of it again because Umbrella Academy
@neokefka_99 @franzferdinand2 @EricaFails @Kevin_Church and starring Casper Van Dien as Johnny Rico!
@uzionmain @Kevin_Church I knew a really conservative artist when I worked at Sony Animation who loved to read it literally. Of course, that was Heinlein's actual leaning I believe
@Kevin_Church I miss when everything didn't have to be ultra-obvious.
@Kevin_Church it's pretty clearly satire, did they miss the bug-stomping scene?
@CatStaggs @matthewdowsmith @ryanbnjmn FINALLY. Thanks Cat!
@TerryDodsonArt @gabrielhardman @johnwordballoon I particularly enjoyed the Trek talk AND taking digs at Joey Heatherton
Next year I will be getting that flu shot.
@declanshalvey @BillRosemann 👊
@BenjaminDewey @BrianChurilla the realtor gets money anywa-AAARRGHHH I hate that guy
@Wil_Moss @steve_lieber @MarkPaniccia I'm sorry Wil!
#comichelpinghand The giants for me were @steve_lieber who made me finish my projects, helped me finish my first graphic novel, read my work when no one would. @MarkPaniccia who trusted me to write story after story and is the reason anyone knows my work at all.
@tomfowlerbug @steve_lieber pushing you in the right direction to stagger back to the hotel room
@rhomzombus @sandy_jarrell I feel we all learned a lesson that night, about empathy

@JohnPontoon @benbatesart oh wow that was longer ago than I thought
@gregpak @fredvanlente @CharlesSoule @geneluenyang this is convenient because all of you have done the same for me! Well actually Gene and I just commiserated, but it counts
@jodamico1 @Kevin_Church Liberty Valence, that's my pick
@benbatesart wow, you have a good memory Ben! Always try to set a final act in beautiful country, that's my motto
It's troubling that the Grand Canyon collections building had uranium out where people could be exposed to radiation, but encouraging that it was detected by a TEEN GEIGER COUNTER ENTHUSIAST.

@PaulTobin @sandy_jarrell Shucks!
@sandy_jarrell Aw
@FrankConniff my favorite thing in McQ is that Eddie Albert played the Chief, fishing desperately to find someone who seemed older than Wayne
@PaulAllor Buchanan, fucking up my science again
@Chris_Kemple the Whiz Wagon
@popgunchaos I endorse this message
Washington! Kennedy! Your Preferred Roosevelt! Ike, depending on how you pronounce the -hower in your region
@popgunchaos I would not cry if it was her.
Our greatest presidents tend to have three-syllable names and so today I'm leaning towards *Gillibrand*  Our most deeply sucky prezzes have one-syllable names; this is just science, folks
@CrisDCasa @DocShaner @steve_lieber @whoajordie even better, let us chronicle the days of her no-good selfish sister Lucy.
@meakoopa +100 for "Upseteros"
@ThatWeissGuy Not Pile: those overalls shorts
@brentschoonover @ronsalas me too! He's tremendous.
@zacksoto Real as you and me, Soto
@HitlerPuncher @turnageb I bet he delivers the papers too!
@turnageb @HitlerPuncher We had a little rag like it where I grew up. It was also the paper where you could fulfill your legal obligations like inviting people to contest a will, etc- and get away with no one ever seeing it
PS I have already read some of it and it is funny AF
@taterpie we'll find out what the director thinks tomorrow! Hopefully the lights on her will help too, I'd hate for her to have to go get lightened again
@HitlerPuncher that's gotta be one of those county papers that are always half police-blotter, half outstanding debt shaming. Plus this one old illiterate who writes something monstrous every week and usually only his cousin reads it
@taterpie It looks really good but it's not Witherspoon-Blonde
@taterpie sort of related; we're debating over whether my daughter's coloring earlier makes her hair blonde enough- she's the lead in her high school musical's Legally Blonde starting in 3 days
@marissadraws @ZackDavisson @mperezwritesirl @TBonvillain @mooncalfe1 @RamonVillalobos props to Zack for pulling that lie out of nowhere
@SaraJBenincasa Stevie Nicks yo
@jpalmiotti @AmandaRantsAlot @Barbie @Marvel she was already good!
@TimCallahan @kara_querl @04nbod I always particularly loved that one, @tommcoker absolutely killed on the covers.
@highway_62 hi-larious
@PaulTobin @ConroyForReal piling on more; Wayne gave Kirk Douglas shit for playing Vincent Van Gogh instead of a more manly role-- Douglas of course was in the Navy during the war (I'm just really trying to make sure Chris Time-Punches Wayne)
@PaulTobin @ConroyForReal also one of the biggest war boosters though he begged out of WW2 because he didn't want to lose momentum with his career. Meanwhile Jimmy Stewart bombed the shit out of Nazis. That gives The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence interesting subtext
@ThatWeissGuy Message Delivered!
@sergio_diaz both at same time, I says
I spoke a few final words over the dead rat we found at the pet door, in short:  "This entrance smelled like two cats and a large dog, what did you think was going to happen"
Fraction and Lieber on Jimmy Olsen!  I f*ck*ng said:  ⭐️⭐️FRACTION and LIEBER on JIMMY OLSEN⭐️⭐️
@blaise_faint @tompeyer "Mr. President, it's better to trust these missions to a group better equipped for modern hazards, say... oh just spitballing... the Justice League"

@schweizercomics I was just watching that PBS clip about how he probably got an infection and the doctors bled him to balance the humours, finishing him when he could have probably slept it off
@Sleestak @highway_62 thank you for your service, AGAIN!
@Sleestak @highway_62 tangent- I hate white power types anyway but extra-damn them for getting their grossness all over Norse mythology
@Sleestak @highway_62 now now, no one's saying they're gunsights, they could also be white power symbols for example
@highway_62 my only guess is that because Trump was able to slag judges openly, he thinks somehow it will work for him, a private citizen
@kenlowery the Truth that cracked the universe open
@JoshFialkov so there's that.
@tomfowlerbug @marissadraws and it could have worked!
@allpaul DID YOU KNOW BRIAN MA- oh okay
@marissadraws that would have been interesting, I like him in the Bond movies
@DanSlott oh yeaaaah!
@marissadraws huh?
@DanSlott EASILY.
hoowhee this is not a good movie about Queen
@ericjschuster "I didn't expect it would knock the whole wall down!"
@taterpie he makes him feel safe.
Some say Trump is bought and paid for, some say Putin is extorting him, I say-- why not both? https://t.co/h4iY2RLNEv
@marcbernardin @shawsam @dustythomason 👍👊👍👊👍
@brentschoonover that's the whole pitch, right there
@PaulAllor @fuzzytypewriter it's really the story of Quint's little weirdo first mate and how when he doesn't go along, it's bad luck for The Orca.
oh shit, Rick Steves has Scandinavian guests on tonight talking about Gnomes, it is ON
@erikburnham @Sleestak I mainly see an occasional back up hosted by Zombie Bucky
This needs to come BACK. https://t.co/C7XTOSyOjJ
@gabrielhardman would also work well with "the creative side" of the brain
@Cyberjaeger yes!
@JAMALIGLE I'd love Limbaugh to have to run into Mueller face-to-face, he'd piss himself.
@RyanDunlavey currently my son (14) has started playing bass and keeps going for mostly really good older music including The Clash and I'm delighted about it.
@RyanDunlavey I think 3 more years? That's "Repo Man-years old"
@RyanDunlavey I can't believe you thought they'd go for Repo Man yet
@OhColeman I just looked it up and saw that the actress was James Cromwell's mom, how cool
@OhColeman Did you get it from Movie Madness?
@Cyberjaeger I wish I'd had more books to get into that
@BrianChurilla The best to your family Brian, sorry for your loss.
@uzionmain get off Fred Armisen's junk, the man's a drummer
@maggieserota I will line up for Dumberbatch
@rstevens oh man, get in line. Or rather, stand by that table and... Ferris will be with you shortly
@danmcdaid Also I'd keep Columbo as if he's perpetually in 1970 while the rest of the world is current. https://t.co/31EDoJDopM
@WarioDraghi @danmcdaid he'd be the one to get under Columbo's skin
@JeffKingTV @UmbrellaAcad Jeff my son was enjoying UA last night, I'll probably start it tonight! What I peeked at looked great.
@Sleestak of course there are
@Sleestak what makes it stick anyway, wax?
@Oregonian good.
@drinkpinkink you're making a very Bob Odenkirk face there.
@DanSlott might as well do Reluctant Astronaut and Ghost and Mr. Chicken to make a Knotts-a-thon!
@Cyberjaeger @cartoonwatchr everyone loves Birdman tho
@highway_62 AND he has a gag order
@ChristianLipski https://t.co/qevM3g947a

@xtop I'll not die on that hill, but I'll remain on it for a hazardous length of time.
@xtop I've not seen him say it, but you know how they're alike and Catherine Keener is in both!
@xtop -GET OUT &lt; BEING JOHN MALKOVICH
@DavidRF34 that was a special time for Detective Comics
@NewMutant @philhester @McLauchlin I doubt it

@bigredrobot @kellytindall that original HTTYD was almost shocking, I couldn't believe it could be a Dreamworks movie (except there were farts)
@ConroyForReal then it's time to move into the Captain's seat
@bigredrobot @ibrill you gotta de-starch them or it's just potato nonsense
@taterpie been watching too much FRASIER
@VaGentlenerd I had to have mine extracted, it was a real party I tell you. The doctors said the area I lived in (The Piedmont) was called "The Kidney Stone Belt" because of the minerals in the water!
@SimonBowland 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
@VaGentlenerd the WORST pain, I had them when I was 19!
@Shockbolt101FDS @TomTaylorMade might be Bruce Campbell's time for a Marvel movie
@DavidWalker1201 haha, that's awesome
@tompeyer @rhomzombus well then I shall purchase this book
@tompeyer @rhomzombus Yeah? Say more!
@RamonVillalobos @thejimgibbons meanwhile Durant is still carrying Kerr through the locker room, out to the airport shuttle
@RamonVillalobos @thejimgibbons right behind the 3 point line
@RamonVillalobos you need some of these RV https://t.co/3xfyvMKlvJ
@tomtificate @VaGentlenerd I like your vision, Tom!
@VaGentlenerd what's the flag, POW-MIA I bet
@VaGentlenerd it's so insane now. When I was a kid in the pre-machine gun era, people just had rifles and didn't fetishize them, the idea of registering them didn't really seem to freak people out. You should definitely have to have insurance too
wow Trailblazers
@KurtBusiek agh, Hyde, yes!
@VaGentlenerd I presume they're sequestered off in some walled office park where no one can protest them.
@KurtBusiek It's a lesser Vincent Price movie, but I remember it fondly.  Also, a brain in a jar
@VaGentlenerd a bill allowing people to carry WITHOUT a permit
@VaGentlenerd did you see what Oklahoma passed today?
@KurtBusiek a Tingler, a Fly
@VaGentlenerd they are such a force.
@VaGentlenerd that was the one where I thought "the country has to do something now, this is the lowest point imaginable"   And boy was I wrong
@RamonVillalobos @thejimgibbons Lillard all up in that Warriors grill, you can't deal
@gregpak American kids do use "rubbish" a lot now, that's a fact
@mercuryeric @gabrielhardman @fangirlsmash True Believers all remember FACEBITE
@JerryOrdway @PatrickZircher ooh, that's good
@OU_Torgo @PatrickZircher @WizardsNorman I will try to get out that way!
@OU_Torgo @PatrickZircher Which store?
@PatrickZircher Oklahoma I assume is a result of a dead heat between the two things but I don't think by law they can stop me from pitching GOTH HOSPITAL
@fakemikejones @PatrickZircher that one made me head scratch even more than Droopy Balls
@McLauchlin @Kevin_Church maybe it was on "Offer Up"

@fakemikejones @ronsalas it seems like an easy rule to change*- you want to lobby, you stand in line yourself.  (*once there are more Congress members to care about it)
@hermanos yeah, but I could've replied and spared everyone. It's like dragging the kid out in front of the whole block
@ronsalas @fakemikejones she really is stepping into that role of being our eye behind the curtain
apologies for doing an RT argument in your timelines everyone, a moment of weakness
Disingenuous. We're talking about people shaping a nation's policies, and this gives corporate funded lobbyists a ridiculous edge. https://t.co/pYt6YZUIW2

@BenjaminBirdie @PRTejeda @Memles this is why we're seeing so many stories set in the past, cellphones screw up a lot of story dynamics.
@PRTejeda @BenjaminBirdie @Memles well it's not as interesting as her running over to his apartment or him going to the party is the only reason, they could remember numbers across the restarts
@BenjaminBirdie @PRTejeda @Memles I kept getting frustrated that she and Alan couldn't seem to call each other on their phones
@joegross really?
@themightylayman @AfuChan1 @droog811 oh man I can't believe you mentioned you have a comic out today UGH  --seriously, why else do you think people follow you Layman? For the sick Tom Peyer burns? Alert us to books!

@highway_62 @ThatWeissGuy @jason1749 @kenlowery the important thing here is we derailed Ken's Coke survey. Good job gang
@highway_62 @ThatWeissGuy @jason1749 @kenlowery same!

@jkaylub @cameronMstewart Caleb the people cannot handle that much MODOK
@Kevin_Church commensurate, but big yes on all these points
@ScooterHarris that's from Lancelot Link, isn't it
@pauljholden that they took a look around and went back in is my favorite part of the adventure.
@pauljholden true- by the way, we've heard all about your Escape Chimps there
@bigredrobot the way to do it is to keep backing up like you're talking to someone behind you, then spin around at the last second
@bigredrobot if you go and see him, go up to him in line and say "I'm Dylan"
@adampknave I'm not even going to turn off your internet because in the construction of that labored joke, you came up with a book I'd like to read.
@gabrielhardman @fredvanlente I like to think his isn't even an action feature, it's just his life.

@danmcdaid @calamityjon I remember the first week I moved to LA I had to swerve back into my lane on Wilshire because she was driving like a maniac to the E! Entertainment building. I can't remember if I shook my fist and said "Whoopi!" like Col. Klink or not
@danmcdaid @calamityjon ooh, I like the idea that it was a set-up
@calamityjon and weirdly, Whoopi was the one who convinced him to do it, it was a real head-scratcher
@mrmarkmillar ?
@ZackDavisson where was this when I was 12 and wouldn't stop drawing that ship. I guess you were also 12, of course
There was a Huell Howser discussion somewhere and I was not apprised https://t.co/ToMjYttxgY
@kenlowery it's what did in Terriers
@kenlowery it's the barrier that has kept me from watching Schitt's Creek despite all my friends vouching for it
@benito_cereno It does happen that a 70 year old might have some teen kids but it's maybe less common than a satanic cult
@benito_cereno It's funny how Suspension of Disbelief works- I was completely open to all the scary elements, the only thing that threatened to take me out of it was Gabriel Byrne. He's too old for that role
No fooling, this is a special book. https://t.co/eNrLMnoXik
@benito_cereno @tweetachromat you guys have seen all the good stuff and I'm still way back in the Aughts!
@benito_cereno @tweetachromat the list to watch, but as I made clear I'm pretty far behind already
@HitlerPuncher @franzferdinand2 @bigredrobot friend, that's all there is to it! Kids will look at you like you're some super wizard
@franzferdinand2 @heythisisbrian @PositronicWoman @kenlowery he hate-watched a lot of movies to get all the jokes about them
@franzferdinand2 @bigredrobot anyway, mix 1 egg, sugar, milk and a dash of vanilla in a bowl. If you ever get a good blanket of snow, scoop a big bowl full of the fluffiest part on top, then mix it in with the goo you made until it's ice cream consistency. Accept prize for Dad of The Year
@tweetachromat @benito_cereno putting it on the list.
@franzferdinand2 @bigredrobot well let me tell you the Good News about Snow Cream, Dylan!  It's Dessert from the Sky, the equivalent of hand-cranked ice cream but without all the work
@benito_cereno @fordgilmore "he's Polanski- without all the, you know"
@GWillowWilson @JoshFialkov I wonder that all the time. And why they ignore the fact* that they themselves were vaccinated to no harm.  *ignoring the facts is of course the bulk of the problem
@benito_cereno it was a lost art for a while.
@benito_cereno that's why I put the "truly' on it! You're right that we're finally getting actual great horror films
@benito_cereno @fordgilmore by the end I was ready to proclaim him the modern Polanski.
@MikeMeltzer she's always worth the price of admission and she really gets to work in this.
@fordgilmore @benito_cereno YES. I'm going to follow Ari Aster around now, and that Pawel guy
One of my many year-late movie takes, but: HEREDITARY is probably the first truly great horror film of this century. @benito_cereno you did not lie.
@JamesWallis just makes me think of the Tharks from John Carter, Warlord of Mars
@taterpie but if i start hearing that one I immediately go play the real one, it will never be topped.
@DonCardenasArt what a little cutie she was!
@DarickR AWK-WARD
@BenjaminDewey I took Stephen and his buddies over to Old Town Music for a bit and they had a couple of sweet Gretsches

@chukw wow you sure want people to get off the subject of The Zodiac really quick Chuck, kinda suspicious
@chukw coded messages reminds me, I watched ZODIAC last night
@GeekintheCity I'm just saying Hugo is a fine actor but a Weird Lookin' Dude
@GeekintheCity I have long said this
@PaulTobin @RafaelKayanan that Return of Tarzan dollar giant was also a prized possession of mine as a kid. I cut out the diorama!
@RafaelKayanan Before they eventually put it into print again, I checked this out of my school library constantly
Seriously, I'm getting an ad every 5 tweets here suddenly. Did Twitter just suddenly feel like I'm being a freeloader
@jonathanhliu it would have really messed up the schedule for Allie's school musical, I'm seriously thinking her mom moved the weather front with pure willpower.
@JohnPontoon @MatthewSBernier Not only was I not in the dust, I must have played Lincoln and Flood 5000 times back in the day
Is everyone else seeing a zillion promoted tweets now? Like way more than usual?
@Williamson_Josh argh I was so close to being the 69th Fave
@xtop it's the hundreds of thousands of lying sailors not disclosing the ice wall around the edge thats' the most impressive part of the cover-up.

@damienroc yeah, we have an equally unimpressive number of snowplows! But really most of us can walk to stores and places, it's not a hard place to be snowed in
@kaydee_artistry wow, I just looked and you're right, it's much less cold there than I expected!
It's that time of winter when people from flat-ass states make fun of us for not wanting to slide down our steep hills! Bonus Portland Fact: they don't salt the roads much here to protect the salmon in our two big rivers
@schweizercomics @MrTylerCrook make snow cream aka Dessert From The Sky
@RamonVillalobos @kharyrandolph @NotZombies so I've heard
@Alex_Antone I took it for the team!
@Alex_Antone keep that talk private, buddy
@andykhouri he's a proud dad.
@Alejandrobot @PaulHChadwick @gabrielhardman Gaines did give a lot of art back later, at least. Better than a lot of companies at the time. I forget who egged him into doing it
@warmoth I knew going in it was a Groundhog Day setup, but it bugged me a little how close the leads are to the leads in The Good Place for a while. But the last 'act' really makes it its own thing.
@PaulHChadwick @gabrielhardman I just want a scene of artists bringing in pages and Bill cuts them a check right there on the spot; that would be drama for ME at least
@carolynmain you and @kthorjensen pretty much run #TwitterAfterDark now.
@warmoth for a minute there it looked like they were going to have the same story.
@gabrielhardman @highway_62 @andeparks and Kurtzman, of course!
@gabrielhardman @highway_62 @andeparks I'd love to help cast Williamson, Krenkel, Frazetta, Torres and all. But probably you're mainly going to get to see Elder and Davis
@seankmckeever we will not celebrate you more than once a year!
@gregpak AGREED. Before this even cranks up to something with a budget, I hope a GND info program can get started, letting the public know things like which regional trees they can plant with the best air-scrubbing qualities for carbon capture
@gabrielhardman of course I'm most interested in the 50's with him, but you've got to get late era Gaines and his out of control Statue of Liberty collection in there.
@seankmckeever no
@gregpak Everyone around me was already sick of hearing me go on about how we needed a climate program like the 60's moonshot, and then I heard her say it too and I thought "we're both brilliant!"
@gregpak A political leader not already beholden to special interests, it's like someone pumped oxygen into the room.
@amandadeibert soon you'll only tweet on "Twitter After Dark"
@matthewdowsmith @PhillipKJohnson @netflix @DEADLINE now that's good news! Way to go guys
@kthorjensen "it's like that time the Freak Brothers had to remove the bag of weed lodged in Freddie's buttcrack! Underground Comics you saved the day here"   also, you're right, that tangent completely blows the storytelling there

@allysonwillsey Chicken and rice, not concentrated!
He's not kidding, this is one of those issues that I'm going to push in front of people for a long time. It's a stand-alone story of James Bond in Lisbon, 1941. Bob's art seriously deserves Eisner consideration here. https://t.co/qx2bgoO9ZG
@allysonwillsey I just had a bowl of soup, it's the perfect lunch choice
@paulreinwand @ronsalas @kmellon I guess they had all that custom made because it's very consistent in design. Unless this is all common accoutrement, I could check with buddy @ErikaMoen who would know better

@Emadjshah @DanSchkade @RamonRosanas You know the Peter B. Parker Spider-Man in that is the original Spidey, right?
@DanSchkade @RamonRosanas Some of my favorite work of Ramon's I didn't even get to write, it's his parts of our AGE OF SENTRY mini-series. He does the 60's stuff so well, I wish he'd drawn a Batman '66 story.
@Emadjshah @DanSchkade @RamonRosanas good tidings unto you, sir!
So glad Dan (find his LAVENDER JACK on Line Webtoon, its fantastic) read our Spidey 1602 series. I'm very proud of it and @RamonRosanas showed what he was capable of. Required a lot more research than usual super-hero work. https://t.co/LiG7YUx8Ix
@DanSchkade This is a delight, you're the best at reverse-engineering story goals in comics. I was reading the Aubrey-Maturin books by Patrick O'Brian to get in 'historical' mode. @RamonRosanas really showed what he was capable of!
@PaulTobin Kind of surprising how accurate this poll was, it shows why there are such even amounts of both stocked at supermarkets.
@CullyHamner @themaimedman that dude is Certified Cool™
@taterpie all anyone needs to do today is wait for the ice-crew called THE SUN to show up, but will they do it?
Everybody thinks "I got this!" until they have to go up an icy off-ramp https://t.co/S2Q0ldQwvt
@maguirekevin somebody let me know when he's being investigated by actual officials though
@OhColeman like half the talking points keep coming back to FIRE
@andrewfarago even BETTER.
@ThatStevenGrant unless they let BEN Stein in the Green Party this time
@KurtBusiek ah, that's more like it
@ThatStevenGrant it's not a real scenario Steven
@nicRDe another one where I'd be powerless to not vote!
@internetfionna they must help me defeat my programming
@DAvallone I throw the ball up near the rim, you dunk it
@steve_lieber fuckin' Dave
and the campaign slogan would be IT'S ALIVE!
Yeah I have a lot of problems with both Al Franken and Jill Stein but if they ran on a ticket together in that order I admit I would need friends helping me not check that box #FRANKENSTEIN2020
@EvieN that was an A+ tweet.
@marissadraws @kmellon @jameslucasjones @MrTylerCrook oh what I miss when I have to clean the kitchen. Btw I can use my sherlock powers and deduce the rocks were in your toilet because someone emptied a gross fish bowl into it
@electricjason Older brothers are the best.
@gabrielhardman let it go
@kthorjensen I can't look at any photo of ALF without thinking of Permanent Midnight
@marissadraws I think I'll be around!
@marissadraws when is it?
@marissadraws @TerriDrawsStuff do Weddell Seals come to help her find the surface hole ( I just wrote a Little Passports comic on Weddell Seals )
@Jann_Jones lol
@alex_segura Cashiers who don't acknowledge in some tiny way that I bagged the groceries  YOU SAID -PETTY-
@bigredrobot @kenlowery he never said any of that shit tho
@LuBellWoo genius!
@Tallychyck I guess as long as it wasn't "Lenin"
@Tallychyck Tally may I put forth the possibility that they said "Lennon"
@JoeQuesada I remember that, thanks for telling your followers Joe!

@rusty_game @philhester that calls for Skankin' Batman https://t.co/1IjJM8SheJ
@Sleestak in my very 2019 reading, at first I was WOW she is COLD and then I thought 'hey, you shouldn't propose to your assistant, not cool' and I guess it all evens out but she didn't get to hook up with a robot
@ThatWeissGuy @rusty_game I would have loved a tour of the Necco factory.
@philhester @rusty_game more like BLECCHS, if this were MAD Magazine
@rusty_game https://t.co/aKhRG1Pn1g
@Sleestak good addition, I snorted loudly at the end.
I like watching the snow fall outside and imagine my son's fury in the classroom that it didn't start last night like the forecast said and he won't miss any school #pdx
@kmellon It's nuts. I've known some pathological liars but I have to wonder, did Mallory keep excessive notes on all the lies he'd told for decades? It seems impossible to keep up with
@electricjason @ARTofCOOP what Mickey Rourke doesn't have an LL name, that baby's wrecked your head
@paulreinwand @RonDanChan yeah, Astoria is a cool town and doesn't deserve to be saddled with such a sub par flick.
It's such a literary baller move to base a victim on your pathological-liar editor like Sophie Hannah did, knowing he can't say anything without burning himself https://t.co/lnKjz0OoLr

@BenjaminDewey @BaddWolfeHowlin my favorite part of that QJ interview a year ago was when he said Elon Musk keeps trying to get him to go to Burning Man and he adds "no thank you."

@ARTofCOOP @saladinahmed way back I used to joke/lie to people that I had a pitch for a new Superman Giant issue like the famous Muhammed Ali one where Superman was now going to box Lennox Lewis
@jason1749 @ThatWeissGuy those Spire Christian Archies are all deeply troubling
@shutupdougan I was just listening to that piece in the car. I look forward to NPR doing a segment that focuses on *Busters* one morning
@RobotJQ that's even better.
@marissadraws They must hate money, and security.
@Kevin_Church It's interesting that for years Bond movies were the only reliable place to find an artsy opening credits sequence.
@bully_thelsb @franzferdinand2 @TimProbable take the rest of the day off, you earned it already.
I walk into the late founder's office amid people freaking out, pull open desk drawer to find piece of masking tape on bottom with password written on it. I am rewarded handsomely and move on to the next debacle https://t.co/2ahzpALivw
@Kevin_Church oddly now the focus is the credit sequence. GOTG  2 and Ant-Man 2 both had really cool ones. I love Radiohead put to this
@pattonoswalt 👍👍👍🤓

@ErikaMoen someone is out of CONTROL
@taterpie I wanted to RT it but it really only enjoys the art so I didn't think that would be helpful.
@taterpie I was just reading that
@bigredrobot @taterpie he actually wasn't even that pissy about it but it appeals to me in the same way that Jeremy Renner breaking both his arms in TAG does
@bigredrobot @taterpie I need to put up a still of him from the documentary when he finds out they changed the whole movie and aren't using a whole stack of songs
@bigredrobot but you're still laughing at Sting's lost songs, aren't you

@marcandreyko @TerryBlas Frosty's hat, Thor's walking stick, Thanos' gauntlet
@CullyHamner ah fart, I guess I read stuff out of order.
@CullyHamner Good! Nice going
@russburlingame @CullyHamner @KarlKesel don't worry Russ, I got what you meant! You're a good dude
@russburlingame @CullyHamner @KarlKesel Right. Also besides being a great friend to Ringo, Karl was the BEST artist to ever ink him- of course you can say that for practically everyone Karl has ever done finishes with
@maguirekevin @ronmarz yes. And they'll be totally cool with him putting Mike's signature on it, no prob!
@CullyHamner I especially wish he'd knock it off with the "I inked him!" defense because of inking once on something else. You wouldn't see an actual reg collaborator like @KarlKesel trying that nonsense
@CullyHamner The least (but still) dodgy thing someone could do there is put "after Wieringo" on the final but to go ahead and *sign his name* to it is fucked up beyond belief
There was never any question that @hotelfred would make a perfect POPEYE strip for the anniversary, https://t.co/y6sWzemJar

@CatStaggs @DCComics now that I look harder, I see it's not a Penn State thing, but a local group who bought ad space
@TheBurnham hahahahahahaha
@McLauchlin you are supposedly an American citizen
@amandadeibert I get not wanting food in the class, but I think even when I taught Freshman Comp drinks didn't bother me, I wanted them as awake as possible. Of course that was before Howard Schultz taught us all to love coffee or whatever
@McLauchlin oh my god there's no way you haven't watched Bill Murray's greatest work
@amandadeibert the rule is you bring the Professor a coffee too or you don't bring one!
@highway_62 the entire Pentagon is just Generals and Admirals throwing folders and slamming phones all week

@THEKarlaPacheco I'm torn between 'get him out of there" and "no, no wait I want to see what else he does"
@THEKarlaPacheco did you read more of the thread, he was actually thinking about moonwalking right there on the spot before his wife shut it down
@RoberteLove he just digs deeper by the minute instead of saying "I was an insensitive shithead back in school!"

@ShellDogDCPR @urbanbarbarian @BeMiraculousLB I didn't think Holden dealt with Pontiacs?
@VaGentlenerd the Chessmaster.
@VaGentlenerd I totally get wanting him to step down, but you might get a lot more from someone who feels they have to prove themselves to the black community. Either way the public needs to see him go through it, not avoid it.
@VaGentlenerd I'd kind of like to see him very publicly own up by doing something hard- like attending a NAACP conference, really facing the music and asking them what they'd prefer he do.
@sdunbier @ArcudiJohn very cool! I loved RFWTM.
@AlyssaRosenberg the raccoon battle is the best part of the whole thing

@jesse_hamm THAT's why it came home! And at the time I'd read anything left lying in front of me
@Manruss it's that weird dynamic THE FOUNDER has, Keaton is engaging but you want the movie to be about the McDonald Bros. and there's no way it can be
it's boring af because it's all about winning for winning's sake. Each chapter he conquers another goal and then asks 'but how could I go even farther!' HOW I DID IT books (with ghostwriters) are cursed objects anyway because they aren't How WE Did It books.
I did read Schultz' 1st book when a roommate brought it home from work ( I guess employees had to read it?) TL:DR- we're supposed to root for him buying out the original Starbucks and hooking America on Frappuccinos

@jesse_hamm @NitrateDiva I don't know why they bothered to make more movies after 1972, tbh
@DanSlott I kept whispering 'they should go grab one of those wardrobe cabinets from the rooms, they look like they'd float'
@sequentialmatt I psyche myself out too, it's a never-ending battle.
@sequentialmatt it's just like comics in that only results matter. I was an English major, and nobody even asked me about my education, they just made me take a clean-up test.
@sequentialmatt also I had moved out to Hermosa Beach and wasn't about to drive all the way to Glendale until I finally got a new place
@sequentialmatt nonsense! I only worked in it for a tiny time but I started doing cleanup boards and was storyboarding within months. That's just how it's done. I almost continued over at Futurama but decided to do live-action commercial boarding so I could do my comics.
@sequentialmatt it's really something you learn on the job, imo
@OhColeman it is PRIMO SAVALAS, too

@Cattifer @ryansara when they focus on him, whoever is Good At Jason comes in- Megan Amram maybe? Like the episode with Pillboi and Donkey Doug. When not, he just gets a Blake Bortles reference and it moves on.
@Mr_Schofield @maguirekevin @YouTube Yeah, the effects were done by the Lydecker Brothers, who would make little models and do forced perspective, that's how Captain Marvel flying looks so good. All of their work was very impressive for the time, still holds up!

@marissadraws only a few minutes ago I figured out how to get through a story point I was stuck at. It fits the logic of things which is nice, but more importantly it's an entertaining way to proceed.
@KyleReadsComics yeah, it was definitely a case where every element put the pressure on and the GOP just couldn't shake the blame
@bclaymoore I always get a kick out of seeing what Ditko thought kids probably looked like
I want to see more real-time FB deletions, this is good stuff https://t.co/KjbP7gYKPN
@PatrickZircher Its the only way the rest of the world would trust us again.
I know, right? https://t.co/rBC6QBxeV8
@costa_kout it's got everything, and it even has an on-site cat. I'd happily keep feeding the cat if it wanted to stay
@tomtificate @JAMALIGLE someone would start to read it to him, then he'd wander down the hall and watch tv.
@urbanbarbarian @TheRealRedSonja @DynamiteComics @sequenceart ooh!
@ShesGotMoxieLMH @McLauchlin @ronmarz @mypauljenkins I bet everyone immediately started brushing their gums as soon as they could after reading that
There's an engine rebuilding shop in my neighborhood that I wish I owned because it's the perfect hang-out garage. The owner even has a YOU WANT IT WHEN? sign inside. I covet this place so hard
@McLauchlin @ronmarz @mypauljenkins @ShesGotMoxieLMH According the news yesterday it looks like you need to bring home some Listerine with it #GumDisease
@JAMALIGLE I predict he will barely ever mention it again
@Ibrahim_M_ @MichaelGarland @SimonBowland @NateCosBOOM SO pissed I didn't say that
@urbanbarbarian @TheRealRedSonja @DynamiteComics @sequenceart hey this is real good and you're real good
@Ibrahim_M_ @SimonBowland @MichaelGarland @NateCosBOOM Bond's all like let me out, aaaah  I'm trapped in a syringe, I am
@McKelvie isn't it? It always reeks of someone wanting everyone to hang in fear.
@TheDrewBrowne @tonymoore I want to help craft this syllabus!   Tuesday: Don't buy gd Drano, just take that p-trap pipe off under the sink and wash it out. NOT in the same sink you little monsters
@TheDrewBrowne @tonymoore teach them to clean the damn lint out of the dryer
@BenjaminBirdie how do you see the film future so clearly
@DaveHendrick 👍👍👍
@seankmckeever @flycojoe YEAH JOE
@highway_62 @ARTofCOOP that's how you beat him, you join hands and dance around him laughing at him like the Japanese school kids in Cabin in the Woods
@kenlowery I hope that catches on.
@YourComicMuse I think he needs the speech, and in a place that makes him look legitimate. But I agree that he probably doesn't want to give it, he wants to go golf the rest of the year
@Manruss a SOTU anywhere else makes him look "illegitimate," a fear-word for him
@highway_62 @ARTofCOOP Eeyore will you let us have one flippin' day
@evanwaters the ideal would be if Mueller could do one more arrest right before the SOTU
@CatStaggs right? It's always where they get pantsed!
@ARTofCOOP afraid so
@VaGentlenerd also, and not that this is important, she looks at LEAST ten years younger than she is. That's someone who takes care of herself
@CatStaggs they're the border to complete nationwide chaos, once they started closing, there were alarms going off in the White House
@VaGentlenerd she does it all so pleasantly with a smile, she's kind of devastating
I do think Trump's defeat today was largely because of the airlines, but I want to credit Nancy "Nancy" Pelosi with taking away the State of the Union speech, there's no way Schumer would have thought of or done that.
@pauljholden oh god I hate this timeline
@JayFaerber hahahaha
@pauljholden as a Fellow Old, I remember it well and appreciate it so much more than I did then!
@danceformyhorse @JonHexLives &gt;👊&lt;
@craigrousseau well, it's a low bar but they didn't sell a bunch of data to a group for Russia to game our election, didn't soak parents out of thousands for their kids playing games, and
@ThatWeissGuy @highway_62 he'll fixate on some other nonsense, like giving himself amnesty for life
Today's news, in brief: If it bleeds, we can kill it.
@highway_62 because we know Trump will abandon a thing that makes him lose publicly, and also people are finally getting paid
@CullyHamner @realDonaldTrump he thought he was hot shit when he had all of Congress and... still couldn't pass most of his nonsense
@ConroyForReal Immiserate!
I just remembered that tweet about Donald Trump Jr. printing out emails to shred them, I hope that guy got a Pulitzer for that.
This is it, this is where Trump shits himself in The Rose Garden
@Spoolses it does highlight the problem of people who assume we check their feeds constantly instead of reaching out with important news. It's "the plans have been on display in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years"
@Spoolses wow!
@bigplastichead "oh here's where I lost a whole day trying to reason with a friend of someone I didn't like in high school"

@taterpie @ericjschuster you are on my card rolodex under "Homies"
@McLauchlin I've been clean for a year!
@taterpie @ericjschuster LinkedIn drove me nuts- I got rid of it maybe 10 years ago and it was hard to get out of even then.
@ericjschuster Been clean for a year, don't regret it!
@CullyHamner also he still thinks it means actual Coyotes that go AWOOOOOOOO
@seankmckeever triple-agree!
@ComicArtGems YES! They literally helped erode democracy not just here but all over the world! It costs nothing to take your account down!  And thanks
We could all delete our Facebook accounts in 2019 to help make the world better. And before I get the standard reply, we all kept in touch with our relatives and friends by phone, mail, Email before it. Pictures of lunch isn't a sacred bond https://t.co/OULSHIgCnU
@tomfeister @CullyHamner They can take it out of his hands!  his tiny hands
@Zat_Thomson you all deserve SO much justice!
@THEKarlaPacheco haha, that was funny to visualize!
I only wish that my UK friends could have a similar fun Friday event, like Nigel Farage getting arrested or some such
@daveexmachina ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Roger Stone, earlier this morning https://t.co/9jX7pmTDYU
@ThatWeissGuy -as is his custom.
But now the wider public is going to soon be made aware of Roger Stone and wife's kink shenanigans back in the 90s, that will make for some interesting news items
You ever wake up way too early because you felt like something good just happened? 👍⭐️#RogerStoneArrested
@bnacker GP? About to watch it in a bit
@bnacker outstanding
@bnacker pardon me sir, do I hear you enjoy Quality Television
@jameslucasjones @kmellon I thought you did that last weekend!
@culturepulp what a great time.
Aw Mitch, I know what would make you feel better- go get some dinner in a nice public restaurant among the middle class! https://t.co/d9fgBlarCP
@VaGentlenerd still one of the greatest threads ever on https://t.co/D158IGihSb
@marcandreyko I wonder that too. I guess the answer is; they always assumed having all the money would lead to happiness, and then it didn't and they're pissed about it. But now they think perhaps the misery of others leads to happiness...
@marcandreyko I feel like we're mostly done caring about the super-rich and any party that doesn't realize that is: stupid, and poopy
@highway_62 speak plainly, writer man
@highway_62 @chukw You'll see him, he'll be there! Drawin'
@culturepulp man, Classifieds took up so many pages! If you wanted to see a car you'd have to spring for a copy of Wheels N Deals or whatever an area called the local newsprint booklet for car ads
@MikeMeltzer and it does have Shyamalan playing a doctor, again
@highway_62 you're going to need to talk to @chukw!
@MikeMeltzer it's a thing that is so embarrassed by what it is
@MikeMeltzer oh it was boring then too
@ohlaika @benito_cereno there is no way he's keeping up with contacts! He doesn't have shoes sometimes
@LuBellWoo @Cattifer @MrTylerCrook really though, would you consider swapping out Religion for "A Calling" or some such
@benito_cereno I kept bringing this up, the ghosts took his horrible myopia away
@LuBellWoo @Cattifer @MrTylerCrook sorta makes one a Zealot? I'd say its more a Bizpulsion
@PaulTobin @erikburnham 💯
For the #newcreatoradvice tag - If a story is coming easily to you, that's actually a good thing! Write it all down even if it's not what you need to be working on at the time. The Muse does not like being ignored.
@marissadraws Fortniters feel so alone
Was doing the Google autofill again to get a sense of the current zeitgeist, and "Does Donald Trump-" did not go where expected https://t.co/A3GEoqXnaL
@MrTylerCrook they assume it's hell, and that paying taxes on more than $10 million would somehow subject them to infernal flames.
@ARTofCOOP really, if I could live in Green Acres, I would. I call Mr. Kimball's job
@ARTofCOOP he saw a show once, where people went into a grocery store, and that's how it worked
@elliotblake and who does not have a driver's license, I'm pretty sure
@David_Hahn @AndreaDemonakos it's such a weird special system- just assign me a seat (that isn't the middle)!
@kthorjensen FUCK THE WALL, CRIME WILL CALL!

@chukw @urbanbarbarian @RobotJQ the all-time greatest Connery quote!
"Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $8,000? You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail!"- Wilbur Ross
@DanielKWay I've looked at those piles before and had that moment where I realized how much of what I'd sent in went into them to die...
@JohnPontoon @urbanbarbarian @RobotJQ thanks! I'd be surprised if more of the foreign language bits aren't off, spell-check thinks they're all wrong anyway
@RobotJQ @urbanbarbarian no you just draw so fast and so much that you're already three books away from that
@RobotJQ @urbanbarbarian (th' drunk schene)
@xeni I canceled my subscription in '17 and it still bums me out that they give me no good reason to come back.
@RobotJQ @urbanbarbarian you drew it!
Plus we have cool @urbanbarbarian covers and @RobotJQ will keep doing the cool war poster variants!   AND in one of these upcoming issues we have Bond *shpeaking like thish* https://t.co/ZR7vjkJ5zQ
@BrianLynch noted!
@nellucnhoj also Joshua Bell is way overrated imo
@GWillowWilson that is the BEST solicit copy
@DanielKWay so same thing really, and we do have Chiarello to thank- New Frontier would have never happened without Ego!
@DanielKWay Way, I'm not arguing but I remember Darwyn saying it was down in a slush pile (stack of submissions on the floor in a corner of the office, for others reading unfamiliar with the term) and Mark pulled it out of that. Which is *essentially* The Trash!
@rusty_game @theisb it's brilliant work!
@rusty_game I hope there's a high res image, that's great
@joegross this sounds like a job for an airplane flight viewing
@schraderbrau88 that's way over his head
@joegross that really made me want to see it though
@Mike2112McKone spread it on *something*
@KurtBusiek I'd love to see him painting more
@taterpie oh god yes
Chiarello!
@BrianChurilla you evaded that trap deftly
Circling back to this because I don't think enough people got how good a tweet it is https://t.co/C4etM2w6Y8
@MrKyleRose @DanSlott 👊
@DanSlott Sluggo calls it 'da Spidah-voise"
@Darkseids_Boots he's just so pissed he already used "Nasty" on Hillary
Trump either can't think of one of his goofy nicknames to go with 'Nancy' or she's just so in his head he's afraid she'll like what he picks.
@ChrisSamnee good because those books were terrible!
@McLauchlin wait I never heard what Shelby was up to the other night when he sat 3 stools down
@EvertonBailey @Oregonian good, I wanted closure on that!
@ChrisSamnee do they read those Daisy Meadows books like my daughter used to
@amandadeibert the hamburger thing was just a week ago

Everyone fretting about the crop of candidates for the 2020 election so far should remember that Deez Nuts was polling well early on

@PaulTobin the *Tropics*
I'm always enjoying stories of entrepreneur's early days building their business on shows like @HowIBuiltThis only to later read "they support Brexit and are moving operations overseas"
@World_Of_Hurt @jorm @seankmckeever exactly!
@jorm @seankmckeever Patrick Wilson is PERFECT as Dreiberg, and he's good in Aquaman, playing a younger guy somehow
@jorm @seankmckeever for me it was weird how much of the dialogue is straight from the book, that could have been altered to sound more natural, but it really starts clicking at the prison break. Also Carla Gugino is the best.
@seankmckeever he even later said he started speaking with a German accent to push the villain-ness, which besides hackneyed, is the very opposite of what Veidt is saying there at the end about who he is
@seankmckeever All the casting was great except Veidt, he got everything about his character wrong.
@fredvanlente @CrystalSkillman pioneers!
@brettwarnock it doesn't seem so
@TerriDrawsStuff I like imagining them using crazy bomb sized explosives "for science"
@xeni I regret reading that.
@TerriDrawsStuff my research suggests that decades of glaciologists putting explosive charges deep in the ice is to blame for glacier collapse
@Matt_Grigsby TVs should be able to tell you what Fox segment they were watching when they went.
@DieRobinsonDie Paul Ryan probably really enjoyed being treated like the office boy
This makes me feel so conflicted- it's Trump being incredibly shitty at his job, yet imagining Paul Ryan here for it sparks joy https://t.co/7x22enM1qv
@DavidPrecht Yeah I don't want to know that kid's name, but I'm fine with his school catching tons of hell for their performance. They need the big embarrassment as a (hopefully) wake up call.
It's not just teens being callous goofs, they're - at this stage in their lives- garbage. And Smirky McMAGAson wasn't trying to diffuse anything. I want to see some parents owning up to this. https://t.co/in5fiuQZSs

@jameslucasjones @taterpie did you get a new one yet?
@jameslucasjones @taterpie what is it? I'll try to think of someone
@MitchGerads I figure any Mitch works

@kibblesmith I can't believe you went Supervirus on a SPACE JAM tweet
@mat_johnson I still haven't been there, how is it?
@ARTofCOOP just like trying to find any mention of Dean Jeffries in relation to the Batmobile
@ARTofCOOP you just sent me down a hole of reading about Daniels and I hit the part where he only got 200 bucks for designing the Munster Coach.  Barris!!
@ARTofCOOP also I just realized they snuck in Arte Johnson's Laugh-In Nazi line!
@ARTofCOOP those Monogram guys had some shit going on, way weirder than Revell.
@dyfl was it   Hint Of Lime
this crazy arctic wind in the PNW got old fast, blow away now
@ARTofCOOP the tank treads!
@hermanos @marissadraws #cursed
@ARTofCOOP found one and not putting it up because everyone will think we're into Nazi shit
@ARTofCOOP brb gotta find a pic of The Red Baron
@CharlieChu @kenlowery I've seen that in one of the others
@dyfl I used to read an essay now I read a Thinkpiece👶
@VaGentlenerd I bet it's the larger staff but the chef is still there so Tubby doesn't have to worry
@World_Of_Hurt we've somehow been swallowed up by "Ambient"
@jason1749 !
@PRTejeda I loved that audio from the Clemson players and the one who says "I thought it was a joke"
@jessnevins the reason is, it's #hot
@ThatStevenGrant pretty sure
I'm with Lincoln up there all 'hmmm' https://t.co/hfietfEv3l
@World_Of_Hurt I had some thought really close to this the other day and thought I was just being an old dude. But now I'm like YEAH
@bigredrobot you're the King of Typos
@zdarsky @dennisculver when they had us riff on that for Fall of the Hulks I kept calling it Sleepy Hulks
@bigredrobot can you now do same with one of my teens
@Devilpig666 it totally works
lol Trump gave them Clown Food
@shawnaldridge dang right you're using headphones Silas
@McLauchlin I used to live right by the Tar Pits when I first moved there. The short film showing all the animals getting trapped in the tar (within 2 minutes) was my favorite thing.
@jfruh yeah picking a specific Catholic church limits who your priest choice, I remember a friend's wedding where the priest referred to the bride by three different names, that was not their wishes at all
It IS a great plan, despite James not knowing how to fly a plane! Pick up JBO 5 https://t.co/tNyZTIgBBc
@BenjaminDewey @dmeconis why am I in the minority on Take Weight Out, join me cowards
@mudron these pieces are so great!

@pascalcampion this is wild, friends of mine and I were just talking YESTERDAY about when the New Yorker would realize you need to be doing covers- Congrats man!
@rusty_game same thing that took down Joe Piscopo and Bronson Pinchot, nobody like jacked comedians  *also Carrot Top I guess but he was never funny
@liberalbastion @kenklippenstein ⭐️👍⭐️
@Ben_Abernathy @sandy_jarrell @Chargers @BL_Singleton @brentschoonover @TransplantsBrew Brandon is great then
@rusty_game I hate corn in my gas!
I don't need political leaders to be Extremely Online people, but I am glad that we're getting a new crop of quick thinkers who wouldn't fall for a BOFA setup
@hermanos tag yourself I'm middle-school David wearing grownup jackets
@gabrielhardman when I was about 4, I used to be scared of the Balok dummy that they always showed in the end credits, I'd run away if it was on
@gabrielhardman agree! Even though CM loses a little steam once they find Clint Howard, it did what I wanted from Star Trek, discovery of the unknown. What I never care for is Federation biz
@Boilerplate1893 @battonl oh man! What a gentleman he was, always.
There's no stronger selling point than "you won't have to do anything"
@erikburnham both are romantic comedies starring Mustache Tim Daly
@tomfowlerbug That said, they may owe me money
@CatStaggs @JAMALIGLE well that went downhill fast!
@jameslucasjones @taterpie @DavidWalker1201 I run ahead and play him in with a track on my phone and one of those jamoji speakers
@DavidWalker1201 is it the same room? I'll pop in and be hype man at the start of class.
@JAMALIGLE I don't know anything about her but I like the idea of multiple women running so Warren or whoever isn't simply 'the woman candidate' in news cycles
@OhColeman thank you for the name of my next novel, WASHINGTON AMUSEMENT
@OhColeman how much was the pinball machine?
@bigredrobot dammit you made me go back and find the name generator to figure out that you're Nightjack
@TheKyleStarks oh man, I'm so sorry Kyle. She was beautiful.

@mattwieringo play an ear-piercing sound file (that only dogs and Superman can hear) for a long time until even they can't stand it.
@storrieville hoping the best for you and the Storrie family, so sorry to hear this.
@taterpie don't disappoint me!
@Kevin_Church props to whoever set up those two pics so it looks like a tiny trump hand on Bezos
@taterpie glad I got to go camp out there before Trump's Base got out there with their saws and ATVs, god damn them

We all talk about how the 45 Administration movie (or series) would go, but I'm growing more convinced it'd be delivered best as a 🎶 MUSICAL 🎶
@SteveNiles @themightylayman Niles was the only one right

@Sk8j it was a Good Death
@MikeMeltzer Infinite Footnotes
@McLauchlin I'm pretty sure I did use you somewhere- I wasn't kidding about the 'forget to tell people' part
@kmellon saving you for a special thing
@TomTaylorMade it us
@YourPalZ with that name, you bet
I was just reminded how much I write friends into comics and then never remember to tell them, or ask permission
@marcbernardin @MistahPete I needed "TV show writer" and you were the first to pop into my head, no lie!
@LucyKnisley she realized a pal of hers also has the book, you are popular with the #teens
@leiladelduca hey
@LucyKnisley hey LK, I gave my teen Relish for Christmas and she loves it!
@ARTofCOOP the way everyone sends Dan Clowes weird little figures they got from a vending machine

@MitchGerads I can tell they're good when the store has a "Jeff Parker' section, stocking Jeff Parker books
@jpalmiotti that was great.
@chukw I hope he drops some indictments right while it airs
@alex_segura @MichaelMoreci @parentdaniel @wastedwings @AllredMD you folks are great and know your stuff!
@Manruss I wondered about that.
@Bustronaut @highway_62 like almost all offices in that part of NC, it was a Hosiery company.
He's supposed to be going on TV to beg for his wall money, but that's not even the real reason. The country's been talking about a bunch of new politicians for a couple of weeks and he can't stand it. He can't stand not hogging all the attention.
@highway_62 my mom brought me home the wire report that came to her office. I never thought to ask her why they received AP wire stories there
@WilliamSingourd yeah, it's a joke. The crab piece is by John Brosio, I didn't mean to leave it up so long or I would have put his credit in the bio (which also wasn't supposed to stay up so long!) Check out more of his work, it's great

@TerriDrawsStuff @THEKarlaPacheco Terri I'm not reading every single tweet you throw out there just because you're heir to the Dell Empire now
@mudron many people do this with Kris Kristofferson and Tom Skerritt
@MikeMeltzer that's the great thing about Kamandi, pretty much every issue has an amazing opening page, often followed by an amazing double page spread!
@TerriDrawsStuff @cheryllynneaton you can hear the guy who's recording, he thinks it's funny
@World_Of_Hurt the other day a guy was being a total asshole to my older neighbors who have a rescued Akida when they asked him to leash his dogs. She gets afraid and thereby scary and hard to control. The dude yells 'then your dog is the problem!' and lies about what the law is, etc
@THEKarlaPacheco this is insane
We try our best to impart useful skills to our assistants, and run workshops, do demos, and generally help them learn about being a working creative. You will also learn where to find the best coffee in Portland City Center

@MysteryCr8tve I wish people wouldn't get puppies if they can't have them with them most of the day. It messes with their little puppy heads and crates do not magically make them feel calm.
@bigplastichead chiming back in to say this is still bothering me, especially the comment about "plenty of spit rags"
@alliamisi I hope you are doing better, my friend!
@gregpak I'm back in 'em!
@Comixace yes! Hey @steve_lieber did you see this?
oh man, now I'm bummed I didn't watch the Golden Globes just to see this! https://t.co/Q58aIJHU4x
@mudron a place where we can go think great thoughts and do great things without all the Normals getting in our way!
@mudron stop you know this will get me railing on Tomorrowland
@thatpetewoods that's it, Woods
@PaulTobin @steve_lieber @TKOpresents @highway_62 @TerryBlas @cheryllynneaton @dmeconis yeah, it's pretty interesting!
@Bustronaut I think it’s for large stone like for landscaping
UPDATE: it is a store, that sells stone. Fun over
@HitlerPuncher it's a shock to people who expect to instead find little childhood treasures in their wall like Amélie came by
@uzionmain I have to go to the store in a minute, I'm going to drive by there and see if there's any reason that spot was chosen
@tomfowlerbug Happy Birthday to YOU!

@taterpie a lot of people did lose power, not in this part of town though. Couple a branches came down
@taterpie oh yes
@crichardhowe @DocShaner I mostly enjoyed it though
@Cyberjaeger but really, whatever makes him go away
@ibrill I remember a guy in LA w a screenplay 'where the Afterlife is run like business' and I didn't say that this take has been going on since the 40s
@Cyberjaeger he's also being investigated by the NY Attorney General, that pardon would only work once
@DocShaner yeah!
@TimCallahan when will autocorrect actually help for once
@RonDanChan what's great is that most people will think you're joking
@bigplastichead I wish I had been channeling Tommy!
@bigplastichead it's blowing the place apart here!
@RobotJQ @dennisculver Has Bob been to GAS yet?
@RobotJQ dude you already draw at sub-light speed
@rusty_game I love that part so much because it's a flashback that Mussberger wasn't actually there to remember, but then once it plays, he relaxes with a cigar knowing he's safe
@CatStaggs @amandadeibert Amanda has the edge here in that she can probably wink without cheating it
@amandadeibert there's White Rihanna!
@RobotJQ you darin' me!
@RobotJQ you'd crush that.
@nprscottsimon Very good commentary, Scott- thank you
@carolynmain may I use the term "Allentown Hot" thx
@jameslucasjones and though it doesn't apply here I like to think he was particularly pissed about those guys selling pigeons in the church

@mudron shapoopi!
@taterpie I want you to get a new avatar just to see how freaked out people get
@mudron I haven't seen it yet, I heard the music was pretty good but got the implication that there weren't any standouts like Spoonful of Sugar etc
@mudron the properest would be magically find some Sherman Brothers songs that were never used. I don't think Mary dislikes poor children but requires a nice room while she's on Earth
@steve_lieber there he is
@rusty_game Aquaman was always the problem book with this subject
@THEKarlaPacheco (don't think through all implications of a random thought) TWEET
squibs are the Shabbos Goy of Harry Potter
Here's how it worked: The Wizarding World gets some of their Squibs (magic people who are duds) to learn Muggle skills, and they put in the plumbing for big Galleons. #ImpeachtheMF
@taterpie @chukw huh
@chukw @taterpie they clearly show the bathroom when they visit Moaning Myrtle
@taterpie who at the Pottermore site thought plumbing was this recent 'technology'?

@PRTejeda @hermanos @bigredrobot people are going to think it's all jokes and forget I actually worked on a Nelly video  (Ride Wit Me)
@hermanos @PRTejeda @bigredrobot the underlying theme btw is that Dylan and I both break into giggle-fits when we think about Renner breaking *both his arms* during filming of TAG

@McKelvie my best humble suggestion, write the name of the room on any leftover paint can
@CharlieChu Life: SOLVED
@MichaelMoreci Oh man, so sorry. What a beautiful furball.
@mudron well it was written by Lorenzo Semple Jr. who was the main writer of the Batman TV show, though DeLaurentis didn't see it that way because that's just his tastes. Looking forward to this one!

@whatthe_shea @Alex_Antone hey happy birthday buddy!
@RobotJQ @dennisculver @ColleenCoover 🤓
@aubreysitterson @RamonVillalobos @dennisculver @ColleenCoover @TBonvillain I love those old Marvel comics that would have that reddish-brown sky background. It made no sense but I like that color!
@RobotJQ @dennisculver @ColleenCoover it's always a different thing when artists color their own stuff! I used to imagine all these beautiful blues and then poof, a great wall of purple. In your hands its beautiful, but for many its the Comics Sans of colors.
As I said, everyone gets the fans they deserve. https://t.co/IQE4hcjuaD
@OhColeman I actively want to hear that it was good for my friends, I don't really buy into misery loves company.
@dennisculver @ColleenCoover I got so fucking sick of seeing my art colored purple I switched to writing
@zdarsky so glad I logged back on
@Manruss thanks, that is a welcome prediction.

@mingdoyle @neilcic a SECRET BABYT !?!  Good work you two!
@JayFaerber going in on the Parkland Kids? He can't even imagine what if his daughters had been near that massacre? I guess it's a natural progression from thinking it's okay to masturbate at comediennes

@Devilpig666 love the thin line and texture!
@tweetachromat I hadn't considered the Shroomage
@taterpie @kenlowery exactly.
@tweetachromat its exactly the kind of thing like a bread machine that people buy and never use. But if you've got apples going soft, it gives them a second chance at being eaten!
@tweetachromat they sure are, friend!
If you ever find one of these stack-level apple dehydrators at a garage sale or anywhere, get it. https://t.co/QdAg4axcky
@kenlowery @taterpie I'd never waste time with a Gater, it was a Bernie person which seemed more do-able

@Alejandrobot BUDDIES NO MORE for me
@RonDanChan well, no
@bigredrobot @RamonVillalobos I often smile when I think of my uncle who has that name, because that man has no jazz, has never heard a jazz, and is bereft of jazz
@bigredrobot @kenlowery @tatianawrites @RamonVillalobos #tastemaker
@bigredrobot @RamonVillalobos I like how you plan ahead what you're going to say

@tompeyer I did see a report mentioning Trump calling a meeting of the Joint Chiefs and asking why 'this Peyer guy' hadn't signed

@cracksh0t 😘
@xavkoenig @taterpie I think it's safer if we leave everyone from past races out, this is too important to let any grudges hold us back. I include Clinton, Joe, all in that. No one is owed a seat!
@xavkoenig @taterpie I have plenty of Bernie pals, and I've also seen some fairly rabid Bernie supporters harass  online Democrats. I'd rather we drop the divisive figures of 2016 going forward, I don't think they'll help.
@xavkoenig @taterpie maybe don't jump in a conversation between two friends who are being kind of jokey in a way that only makes sense if you were around for a lot of their past conversations.
@taterpie yeah, I'm glad she at least doesn't have that particular pressure dumped on her now because of the 35 year old rule, the only rule Trump passed easily
@taterpie they're ready to hate any woman ya got
@JeffreyVeregge @DocShaner we'd like to see that too

@bigredrobot smash ya boy out a chicken parm
@hermanos yeah Bucky did not inspire fans to turn to each other with open mouth expressions in the theater.
@bigredrobot As usual I do not begrudge Bill Nighy
@bigredrobot hey now we're all at the airport, this is like closure, right?
@bigredrobot There's so much to hate about it, but I think what I hates most is that it just snags the ending from ABOUT A BOY out of nowhere, figuring Hugh Grant is in it too so you won't notice
@tomfowlerbug @highway_62 I am _ashamed_ I didn't think of Bruce.
@danielralston AUGH

@obnor2k2 Merry Christmas, Brister Gang!

@ARTofCOOP that is so slick. Wagons are so much better than SUVs in every way.
@brentschoonover he's good, too! Merry Christmas Schoonovereses.
@jesse_hamm @imemi Jesse's like 'not as long as Two Front Teeth is still played on this radio!'
@McLauchlin @zachpennington keep an I on him!
@SalHas81 oh god that is so bizarre I don't know where to start
@alex_segura To her long life!
@TonyParkerArt Right??
All I want for Christmas is The President to shut the fuck up
@patloika 👊
@SanctumBlog yeah at least yours has fun little specks on it, I would do that for cookie gifts too! I'm a fan of gift bags, they really save you in a last minute-just-remembered-a-birthday emergency
@dyfl sending strength!
@dyfl enjoy Southwest!
@highway_62 not where you want a turf war
@philhester Grainger, by a landslide!
@dyfl RIP
@NicolaScottArt it's all about Geena snapping the neck of the robot deer
@kibblesmith @JenAshleyWright NOW you two are truly one.
@tweetachromat that is EXACTLY what it feels like
@sequentialmatt congrats booksellers!
@AndyRichter that's our clue he's not all bad, because he's also a nice dog
@dyfl @darrylayo same! And as we've all said at one point, no one (except the worst assholes) is going to want to admit they voted for Trump and that Russia excuse will be invaluable
@highway_62 typical Sunday eve 🎶
@BenjaminBirdie no lie, that is my favorite little bit in Hudsucker.
@ThatWeissGuy you can feel how it's practically ready to liquify right into petroleum too
@dyfl @darrylayo I just get real weary of seeing people say we deserved it. We did not, Puerto Rico did not, the refugees don't deserve to lose their kids, and Sally Yates should be sitting in the seat Kavanaugh is farting up
@dyfl @darrylayo Even though our Olds should not be so impressed by Impact font on top of pics of Hillary, the entire propaganda effort and much of Trump's campaign was funded by Russia and simply illegal by what few election rules we do have.
I can't believe that I  A: bought transparent wrapping paper and  B: they make transparent wrapping paper and phooey on the Hallmark people, if this isn't a trick to get rid of a bunch of Easter basket plastic, why do they put a nice color gift paper on the tube to trap ya
@monkey__marc bloody well right
@Ben_Abernathy @brentschoonover @sandy_jarrell what a label!
@Ben_Abernathy man that battery lasted a LONG time!
@chukw @steve_lieber @mturetsky that's what I wonder, there's usually a battery for the readout. The wire in the wall is only for it to send the orders to the furnace- but you _would_ have some weirdo one that breaks the rules
@kibblesmith Black AND Gay?! In THIS economy??!!  ok I've finally gotten the economy response out of my system
@PaulTobin I feel like no matter what she says, "Space Gun!" is going to be his response
@taterpie 😲
@DustinWeaver12 we'll try to switch it up, Sunday often works for those because its an otherwise dead night for the venue, but maybe we could do a Monday as well.
@Ibrahim_M_ yaassssss
@DustinWeaver12 I was getting over a bug so I ran out of steam quickly. I'm a lot of fun!
@DustinWeaver12 hey sorry I didn't get to talk to you last night!
@heythisisbrian Hoskins Smee is the one good thing I can focus on in it
@sandy_jarrell @Ben_Abernathy Really, how is that Greenville beer?
@gabrielhardman dog wants pizza- just give us lots of coverage and we'll pick later!
@laura_hudson You're one of my top Funnest Friends, easily
@LelandPurvis @BenjaminDewey those assholes largely won't be back, they were only in it for Trump. Throw them a shit sandwich
@BenjaminDewey @LelandPurvis I genuinely don't think we can get respect from the rest of the world back unless they see us lock up our President. That would go a long way. Also he can't necessarily be pardoned for everything by another Prez
@LelandPurvis @BenjaminDewey depends on the charge, I don't think they'd do it if Treason.
@mattwieringo of course, what about the Dr Who Christmas episodes?
@SamRoseWatson -gasp-
@McKelvie the word brings me PAIN
I'm eager to go see Mary Poppins Returns but I have to admit I'm a bit troubled by the fact that it seems to be the same plot as HOOK
@mudron "is Ladyhawke a Christmas Movie"
@BenjaminDewey I also want as many of them in solitary as possibly and my extra Christmas wish would be for Sally Yates to somehow be seated on the Supreme Court.
@BenariLee that one Nazi officer back there cannot be interrupted from his job directing our munitions plant being sabotaged, Hitler's safety be damned
The sweetest part of #TrumpResign #ResignTrump (whatever your fave) is that if he did it, he'd think his troubles were all over and then get the shock of seeing the investigation continue
@taterpie maybe as you leave, go for it and put on CNBC
@laura_hudson Happy Birthday Hudson! 🎂
@ianmacewan that part didn't look very Jack Davis to me, but once they got to the TV trailer, it SCREAMED Davis. But hoo-boy, did this not need to happen
@ianmacewan all the penile imagery on the planet apparently wasn't enough, look at the throne https://t.co/8aBluInSrN
@cheryllynneaton do you have a good sewing machine?
If I were a candidate, I would completely accept donations from groups I didn't believe in and then govern/vote the way I was going to anyway. Then when they called me on it I'd say "oh dag, I forgot, bro. Next time tho!" and repeat
@jesse_hamm Jesse's right Bob, you are!
@bigplastichead ha-ha!
@gabrielhardman I figured! I always treated screeners like airplane movies where I watch things I'm sort of curious about but don't have big expectations for- so I might as well watch it in a seat back.
@gabrielhardman I still haven't seen it
@highway_62 He didn't get too fussy about it because I put butter on it, which someone advised me would help it slide down easier.
@bigplastichead I would love to have a pic of my family in Chitty Chitty. It was a favorite of mine as a kid and I sang Hushabye Mountain to them constantly as babies.
I successfully got my cat to swallow his worm pill! Now we play... the waiting game https://t.co/Tr67JSWk9S
@bigplastichead that's a toughie, I like the song. Like it makes more sense to cut out the oddly saucy "Choochie Face", but I feel like they wanted to give Gert Frobe a fun bit and he probably deserved it.
@bigplastichead love that Q and Goldfinger are in it! And it's some great Sherman Bros songs overall.
@bigplastichead I always want Trudy's song cut out, it's just so long and doesn't advance anything.
@brianwolfstuff yeah, it feels like the point of the article is to troll us
Sorry to keep talking about that 25 year old money guy, but when people question that he'd have roomies, I think back to Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett being flatmates when they were both already fairly successful.
@marissadraws @RonDanChan I don't begrudge the guy, I just wonder what the point of the article is. Be frugal like guy who doesn't have to be? I think it would have benefitted from showing the budget breakdowns of several people w different incomes and work.
@zdarsky have a happy, sexy birthday
@CharlieChu I especially want to see that because someone might owe me $
@McKelvie ugh, were you going through Gatwick?
"Bro you're on track to make 100k next year? Hey float me on rent a few months"- that CNBC 25 yr old's life now that the other roommates have logged on
@uzionmain Idk why we aren't forming a human wall around her everywhere she goes
@ChrisEliopoulos I know, I just wanted to make a In This Economy joke
$20 Internet? In THIS economy?
@fordgilmore OOF
@bryanedwardhill yeah, we've begged him to do it for two years now, he seems to be fine with it.
@BrianChurilla that would be fascinating.
@SGirner @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Get a CharlieCard, Girner!
@fordgilmore are you trying to destroy Hollywood, Ford?
Thanks to James Bond Radio for a great talk, and thanks to Bob for calling out my handsomeness https://t.co/yTBcdnLClq
@monkey__marc @RobotJQ @brentschoonover @duncanfegredo @Coelacanthkiss @Inkdropinc @JenniferLMeyer @Hamm_Tips @johnwordballoon @TerryDodsonArt @PageFortyFive Merry Christmas Marc!
@DanSchkade @OhColeman they were the two movies my dad and I would talk about as our favorite Fords and Westerns. He was The Searchers guy, I was LV, and nothing really diagrams our relationship and how it intersected better.
@PatrickZircher they're more popular than ever because we all feel like weak children and crave power fantasy, maybe
@DanSchkade seriously fuck them
-the Tax Collector in POPEYE. He described the whole set in Malta and seemed to enjoy the memory. What a great guy and an exceptional talent.
An actor with incredible presence, and my neighbor for a while when I lived in Hermosa Beach. He stayed there half the year and was always very nice to my cat who liked hanging out on his porch. The only time I ever asked him about his films was his role as- https://t.co/SnCTtO1fPy
@GlenDavidGold and considering you live in California, that says something
@taterpie about the same
If historical perspective helps at all, go look up Caligula and how his rule wrapped up, you'll feel better.
@gregpak @xeni big agreement
@gregpak @xeni I'm super-nostalgic for when news was only on two times a day and then everything stopped at 1AM
@comicsreporter "guy smashing someone's head with a bottle... eh, not enough"
@TerryBlas some wassailin'
@jpalmiotti @tommyleeedwards @Oeming @dave nice work, @Devilpig666 !
@JACKOHMAN seems pretty simple!
@thezacksmith @erikburnham @TBonvillain that dog gets a friend who is a mountain lion
@TBonvillain yeah, that made me feel like I'd been tricked into going to one of those secret church events
@THEKarlaPacheco that sounds like one of those white letter decals someone would have on the back of their car:  Slam Dunking                                           Self Pleasuring
@David_Hahn the use of the word "pout" makes clear that a parent wrote the song.
@TheOnlyTrout @ColleenCoover could snap up Jeeves at last
@pauljholden it's a pre-Brexit farewell
@DocShaner draw them dogs doc
@kenlowery @THEKarlaPacheco @cheryllynneaton I'll stop preaching now, I just hate it. It hasn't made things better. "Acting like a public utility" is the perfect description
@THEKarlaPacheco @kenlowery @cheryllynneaton finally someone is honest
@THEKarlaPacheco @kenlowery @cheryllynneaton everyone's still got email, Pacheco! It's been shown that FB doesn't let your promos get very far unless you pay. We were all better off when we didn't have access to everyone we ever met, imo. We've handed a frat stooge crazy amounts of power
@jason1749 I guess this movie leaves out COL?
@THEKarlaPacheco @kenlowery @cheryllynneaton I respond with Morgan Freeman appearing to endorse a diatribe
@kenlowery @cheryllynneaton If the algorithm lets me!
@cheryllynneaton yep, an almost-development.
@kenlowery @cheryllynneaton All those old folks have a phone! I gotcha, but FB depends on everyone thinking they're performing a public service and assuming everyone checks it all the time. We got along fine without it for decades, it's a scourge I says
@cheryllynneaton hot damn, another MW storyline where something almost happens
@Joe_Hunter Be well, Joe, sorry for your loss.
Mr. Peanut wears a top hat and monocle, this comes as no surprise https://t.co/e72akq9FgT
@marcandreyko @Mike_Dougherty I seem to remember you could take his tail off and store stuff in it.
@bigredrobot @zacksoto Ayyyy, Cunningham
@ARTofCOOP he loves that shit
Don't be like my son either and invite half your friends for a sleepover when I'm an oozing sickness
Don't be like me kids, get a flu shot
@tonymoore @studio13toledo Happy Birthday Colonel!
@JerryOrdway @MichelFiffe @zacksoto I was there in the back too- once Todd revealed himself in undies, the crowd was totally on his side and it was over.
What happens when a car breaks down in there, is the next invention a tow truck that works from the front https://t.co/kKdA1oknxd
@gabrielhardman Hammer Horror it up
@ericjschuster @TerriDrawsStuff @gabrielhardman @highway_62 @bigredrobot concurrent
@RoberteLove it's kind of weird when Disney animation is way sexier than a live-action take. Well, maybe not
@RoberteLove why is everyone wearing TONS OF CLOTHES
@SimonBowland look man I just did a lettering draft of the script the other day knock off the subtweeting
@bigredrobot dammit, I was going to make a In This Economy joke today and you used it up
@MysteryCr8tve @gabrielhardman @highway_62 @bigredrobot I can't find ANY reference to it though I remember reading about it like in... 2014? It was a bizarre idea then too, no wonder it's been scrubbed from the internet
@TerriDrawsStuff @gabrielhardman @highway_62 @bigredrobot more proof you were the one who spread the rumor of me being a child actor that everyone just took as fact without looking into it.
@gabrielhardman @highway_62 @bigredrobot do you remember that talk of opening a Kroft-superstars themed bar/club in LA a few years back?
@alex_segura *Supposedly* it's all wiped! Not sure I believe it. I downloaded all my Facebook posts first to make sure I got some pictures.  I do feel like if you have a business in the US, the least we can expect is that you not sell out the country.
@alex_segura it was the Cambridge Analytica deal. I was already certain FB's fake news memes had warped the election, but then that confirmation went way beyond every line in the sand for me.
@joeharris he went to the future to play basketball.
@fordgilmore Laverne and Shirley's place was Oscar and Felix's!
@sexualcabinetry Oh I remember MR. COOL!
@tweetachromat I definitely believe Boulder smashes laws of physics.
see also; Mork, Mindy
now remembering Joanie and Chachi did an even bigger time jump because their show was set in the 80s yet they were not suddenly in their 30s. So in short Happy Days posits that Milwaukee is an anomaly and leaving its border will propel you into the far future
Penny Marshall was a powerhouse (Myrna on The Odd Couple!) and could even make you not care that Laverne and Shirley starts in the mid 1950s and later timeshifts to the late 60s which does not affect Lenny and Squiggy for they are timelocked
@davedwonch @Ibrahim_M_ Dave hush
@ibrill saving this one
@ghweldon did it  flow
@maggieserota It's okay.  (we don't know what Mueller knows)
@RobotJQ @McLauchlin @SimonBowland @chance_second whew!
@ghweldon I particularly liked: "the comedyish series Entourage"
@RomanPStevens @Ibrahim_M_ 👍👍👍
@jesse_hamm dude just go have that transmission rebuilt
also don't worry, we are still searching for Bond artist @RobotJQ who was lost in a canyon and we won't give up until he's NOT in a canyon
And check out that @urbanbarbarian cover, that is HOT https://t.co/fjBcc0VoNX

@OnePerfectShot Stoner Floyd from True Romance
@sandy_jarrell the Famous Flying Ace can't stop dreaming about climbing the skies of France in his Sopwith Camel, battling the Red Baron
@maggieserota FYI Maggie, thanks to you, every time I leave a group of friends to go home I conclude with "we don't know what Mueller knows"
@Jonathan_Case Dorothy's boots over there are troubling, it looks like a magic act where you sawed her legs off
@OhColeman he'll break a Thunder Egg* over your noggin  *geode
@OhColeman Coleman I believe you are referring to   *Ed's House of Gems*
@dyfl please direct the making of video software that mutes/pixelates Jimmy Fallon in any YT clip
@Alejandrobot No better line this year than "the queen’s nipples had grown significantly, increasing suspicions that she was the Chosen One."
@Elisabethf I think of it all the time when I pass that area
@sunstrouckel @rogercruzbr nice! It's so good to see Roger's work, I hope he's doing well these days.
@Elisabethf especially if it was on Sandy by the Comcast building! I hope they're feeling fine.
I like that Spider-verse reminds everyone that Kingpin is really a Spider-man villain who Daredevil has just rented for decades
@jameslucasjones @coavacoffee Dive into them like Uncle Scrooge
@Wil_Moss Kids make a great time marker that way. My kidless pals are forever freaked out when seeing how old mine are and I can tell they've just been snapped out of their timeless sense of existence for a minute.
@mariejavins @whatthe_shea A true Boss!
@Wil_Moss wow, it's been 5 years already? Congrats!
@declanshalvey @DocShaner same! Mulaney was the perfect casting for him.
@JohnPontoon @jasonlatour similarly, I often do those 'explaining' tweets to make people lay off the jokes by robbing all the fun out of them!
@JohnPontoon @jasonlatour the 2nd tweet only connects to the first line
@DocShaner "Can you float through the air when you smell a delicious PIE?"
@jasonlatour 💙
@zacksoto yeah you do
@crichardhowe I like that world's May!
@OhColeman I've gradually become one of those annoying 'inward' laughers, but not that time
@jasonlatour I can only imagine what that was like for you! 🕷️
It's NUTS how good Spider-Verse is. It is an *experience*.  Also I can't believe my favorite line in the whole thing was from Spider-Ham
@mudron @dmeconis @steve_lieber this was so great.
@steve_lieber that was so perfect too
@DocShaner now I do toooooooo
Waiting for Spider-verse to start: don’t yell at me I’m not going to tweet during the movie like Scott, the lights are still up!
@mattwieringo The only time (I think) that even Columbo pauses to stare at a hottie.
@JohnPontoon @David_Hahn Yeah, that one worked well as a stand alone episode. I also liked the one focused on Theo. And all the Carla Gugino bits. Really as long as it wasn't focused on Steven, I was engaged
@tommyleeedwards @al_ambition you're right, that is EXCELLENT.
@David_Hahn ugh now I'm going to go back into Netflix to find it
@David_Hahn really? I remember him saying it at the funeral home later. Also, I did a triple-take when I realized younger him was ET Henry
@Matropolis86 I've not heard- thank you!
@dyfl @IvanBrandon his line "You killed my mother's sister!" will haunt me forever.
@David_Hahn THAT is where I saw it too! Though it was Timothy Hutton saying it in the present I think (or maybe just a few years previous) so it didn't poke me as much as the Irish guy in Man in the High Castle saying 'sounds like an anomaly, all right'
@David_Hahn I noticed "been a minute" used in some weird past context too, what was it?
@thatpetewoods what did we do to you?
@comicsreporter Many Happy Returns Spurge!
@McKelvie wow, I can't either
For @iammrvandy's birthday, let's not forget he was one of the all-time best COLUMBO villains https://t.co/147bR1AJdy
@taterpie no, might go tomorrow
@taterpie what songs?
@RonDanChan that is cool
@sandy_jarrell hey, what a good idea Sandy!
@bigplastichead I'll zing him sometimes, but it's a great piece still!
@sandy_jarrell I was thinking about your chair situation when we were there
@sawdustbear Cool set up! do you have those suction cup window shades too?
I hope everyone agrees that LED bicycle spoke lights make the perfect stocking stuffers because that's what's happening
@declanshalvey A tweet is somewhere between a stray thought and an action, usually closer to the former, imo. But we tend to experience it as an action, and react as such. Anyway I wish Twitter would impose a per-day limit to encourage people not to dwell.
@Chris_Kemple turns out the guy's gun was a replica- he got shot (of course) but lived
@smcinern hey thank you
@DanSlott @LostonWallace I figured there couldn't be another! That fella has talent.
@DanSlott btw did @LostonWallace do this guide?
@DCComics @Walmart can't get enough @NickDerington art!

@MattAdlerComics @MarkPaniccia you can't always trust the close reading of online summarizers! :)
@Weezer @RiversCuomo @TheMonkees great tune, and my favorite art is @AllredMD drawing Julie Newmar!
@tweetachromat I had a surprisingly calm one sleep on me the other day! Well it was calm for a bit anyway
@MattAdlerComics @MarkPaniccia we said both in the series, it was mistranslated on purpose to be a slur. Claw played into that to build up his menacing legend for Jimmy's sake

@raineboyd checking back in but no pic of Jordan dancing on a rooftop with soot on his face has appeared yet

@TravisBudd no, he was dropped out of the saucer but it sure looks like he can there! Good ol' Carlo
@raineboyd Raine, if you've never gone as Mary Poppins on Halloween then something is not right in the world

@HopeLNicholson yeah, it would have killed the pacing!
@HopeLNicholson yeah, on another watch through the video glossed it right where it would be clear. I wonder how long it took to race home and back
@gregpak I'm happy for Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who has one of the best roles as Tagomi on Man in the High Castle.

@Secretoriginz probably. But it does seem like a lot of people are in flux
@tweetachromat well I do think there's ONE person in the country who never will
@tomfowlerbug @jesse_hamm it would totally work done straight. I'm most interested in Superman as a job-placement agent, whatever company he's flying you over at the moment is where your new career will be
just over here in Oregon, trying to process Woke Ammon Bundy
@jesse_hamm she also seemed fun, which is something a lot of takes on LL seem to avoid, making her kind of mean. Which a Kent probably wouldn't like
@kmellon @kellysue hey
@Ron_Randall ugh! At least Jill went out the Garden entrance and wasn't by the Starbucks
@jesse_hamm she was *spunky*
@kellysue 👊
@brentschoonover @MitchGerads Brent Respects Fridays
@MikeMeltzer -whew-
@xtop I can't imagine many in town are making money, they seem to be just waiting each other out.
Scary- my wife was leaving this Fred Meyer just as the police were racing in. #America https://t.co/KURAW7D1MC
@kenklippenstein no lie, I would pay for this site if it went to such a model
@PaulTobin @ColleenCoover 🤯
@PaulTobin @ColleenCoover I can't believe this thread hasn't already eclipsed the Break Into Comics thing from the other day, btw!
@PaulTobin @ColleenCoover did you know what it was as soon as you read it? I rest my case
this guy! https://t.co/RCDoWK7vaC
@PaulTobin @ColleenCoover Steve's got another one!
@brentschoonover @kmellon @marissadraws whaaaaaat it's Schoonsgiving, hot damn!
@gregpak ha-ha, now you have to start drinking
@nikdirga I like this kid.
@bigredrobot @RamonVillalobos https://t.co/4sF08olR5P
@taterpie you're still mad about the niece thing
@taterpie I'm saying it wouldn't affect the Peggy of the 616 (ugh, sorry) and make some alternate Peggy happy
@taterpie it would be an alternate timeline, wouldn't it?
@bigredrobot the great thing is that I knew it was coming after I saw the trailer, and as always you did not let me down.
@kmellon man, I was just thinking of that guy the other day
@tomfeister how many since TERRIERS?
@bigredrobot the first thing I thought of too :)
@MrPeytonReed @newsobserver @UNC @ChancellorFolt @ThomGoolsby I wish they could rename Carrboro too, after reading Carr's insanely racist dedication speech at the statue unveiling
@amandadeibert I can picture it so clearly! Thanks for their story Amanda.
@highway_62 well just make yourself at home
@tomfowlerbug those people are not your friends.
@RichardCasey @marcbernardin I think she's brilliant but she's always been way too interested in backstories and reveals and this suffers from that acutely.
@RichardCasey @marcbernardin and man, what a waste of Ezra Miller, he just stares at the floor while people keep telling him things. And you get a backstory! And you have a backstory! Sorry I keep ranting, my kid took me along to see it
@marcbernardin Yes! I think the worst offense though is that the story keeps forgetting to be entertaining.  Jude Law seems to realize someone should bring some charm to this, but he's only in it a bit.
@marcbernardin He's pretty irrelevant to the story, whatever it is. Shout out to Queenie (and everyone else) for doing what the plot told them to do, no matter how little sense it made
@HitlerPuncher @ThatWeissGuy I thought that because I never saw it again after moving out of NC, and I probably always associated it (wrongly) with the town there
@ibrill I love that they thought Two-Face would be too scary for kids and ended up doing something truly horrifying
@marcbernardin 👊
@neilkleid @philhester boo, hisss
@HitlerPuncher I 🧡 that you spell the song like that watery steak of the South
This is the most I've been in Cruise's corner since EDGE OF TOMORROW, which also needs to be viewed with Motion Smoothing OFF https://t.co/7Tv92skHfr

@SimonBowland ol' Subtweetin' Simon
@DocShaner @ronsalas @MitchGerads oh cuss!
@Kevin_Church Sulu hear "Naked Time!" and took it seriously
@dyfl terrible.
@ScooterHarris it sounds great until you find out your posts don't make it in every friend's timeline, as I understand
@mfpseth @kalebhorton there's GOT to be a lot of overlap with Bohemian Grove attendees.
@OhColeman I don't *need* the approving nod at the counter, but when I get it I do walk out feeling pretty tall in the saddle
@amandadeibert I wish I were the Press person responsible for this headline and picture, they single-handedly got everyone thinking about NASA
@mattsouthworth I fanboyed at Rosalynn being there
@thatpetewoods I like the door!
@CharlieChu I respect your sick takes
@TerriDrawsStuff @jesse_hamm resurrection is all about the Top Hat.
@shawnaldridge didn't one usually bleed right into the other?
@rusty_game @jesse_hamm Frosty is a snow-golem
@jesse_hamm what? He totally DOES die at the end
@shawnaldridge too young for Doug E Fresh.
@shawnaldridge were you playing The Show while you explained?
@philhester 😫
I feel like this is payback directed personally at me for ruining other fan's childhoods. Check and mate, King Features https://t.co/OWa7Za8M1K

@mudron I bet they played Elvis' 68 Comeback show every Christmas.   Also, hell yeah Benny Hill at 11:30
@IvanBrandon more awesome: he runs with whoever to be VP AGAIN
@BrianChurilla @bigplastichead I'm going wide with that
@BrianChurilla @bigplastichead the truth is all these now-aware people are just enthralled by the idea of a president you could go weeks, sometimes months without having to think about
@steve_lieber Flynn-tastic work everyone!

@andykhouri Whoever hosts the Oscars should begin with telling everyone to turn off Motion Smoothing.
@1KevHamilton yeah, not that there's ever going to be good timing to lose a son, but that was especially bad
@electricjason (flips through rule book) "There's nothing in here that says-
@jimmmers feels like this is one of those roles you don't want a 'name' for, in movie terms. I just really don't want a rematch of 2016 mainly, hope for new people.
@taterpie Primaries count as running! I don't make the rules- well except for this one. Al Gore lost a primary, later lost the big one. Richard Nixon lost the primary and won the general, and he turned out to be Richard Nixon!
sorry Uncle Joe, you were a great VP but The Parker Rule applies to you too: https://t.co/sKDcs4gceB
@World_Of_Hurt also according to the Parker Rule, he cannot run.
@PaulTobin @ChrisSamnee @Jody_Houser I found a li'l Samnee Gorilla-Man in my kid's desk the other day, they're everywhere

@brentschoonover @lousupercon this is flippin' COOL.

@jrobertdeans @gabrielhardman @steve_lieber I'm really surprised he still had that for you to get. No I'm not, he never goes anywhere, it was destined to be your page
@BrianChurilla @SeidmanLea @MrTylerCrook I can talk to you and not dudes from high school I didn't care for then. Also I feel FB really influenced the election way more than any other media.
@gabrielhardman yeah, I sometimes feel like I have this secret advantage in that I'm not going to like the same pages as everyone else. But nothing beats the time @steve_lieber bought Wildey pages where the guy thought the page number was the price

Who out there is finally going to delete their Facebook account (not the app, the actual account!) for the new year to kick off 2019? You have a few weeks to make sure you have the good friends' contact info, make the resolution, you'll love it
@Wisenheimer FR, IRL!
@xtop the best face.
@cheryllynneaton that's exactly the way it was with Nixon, though I don't know what cover story all his voters used. They probably just said 'ooh look!' and ran off when the other person turned around
@damienroc @cheryllynneaton I think that's at least as likely
I'm already pre-mad at the people I know will say something ignorant like "I didn't notice anything being all that different" just like some old-timers referred to the McCarthy era https://t.co/ONF4Gh5rZI

@andykhouri I truly believe the pants are that baggy because they don't want anything clearly defining the diaper.
@heyjimhill @ghweldon he had the goods, no doubt!
@ghweldon yes but F Troop knew that the guaranteed laffs were always Larry Storch in red longjohns. RIP Fred, likable enough that no one resented him for not being Andy, daring enough to drive a sentient VW Beetle.
@heysarahsweeney it's a good one!
@RobotJQ would not have guessed that!
I'd not heard this about altitude and mood before. https://t.co/ZP8QqhU1hC
I can't stop watching that G20 footage of Trump walking off stage when he's supposed to stay there. It's the little wave to the audience and the framing of the whole thing like Mike TV on screen in Willy Wonka, it's perfect
@sandy_jarrell @Ben_Abernathy I'll be Bourdain about this and say that was perfectly fine WHILE I was having nachos. I don't see any point in drinking it by itself though.  Waiting on the new beer to get cold, got it from the stacks at Grocery Outlet
@Peposed @kibblesmith oh Ike!
@PatrickZircher From what I've seen (when I'm actually paying attention) the oversized first issue seems to work pretty well.

@bigredrobot incredible- that leaves a hole where some movie about anything else might get a week of attention!
@HeathCorson @PatrickZircher it did really well for 52 back in the day, surprised we don't see more of it.
@marcandreyko you done REAL good pal!

@PaulTobin yeah, its crazy dark outside already too, not cool, sky

@kalebhorton people love our books, in movie form
@ThatWeissGuy @bigredrobot I think it was the second one, which didn't even have something as fun as Monster

NdGT biting on that guy's big numbers tweet about trusting scientist, c'mon Prof
@BenjaminDewey @Tallychyck now post some sketches already
@ARTofCOOP he puts to rest all those Columbo villains who are horrible killers but still will take a fall for the sake of their kids.
@gabrielhardman I just looked on the map- it's so wild that now there's stuff like this where it was Skid Row
@andrealrosales don't worry, they went back and convinced him to be himself!
@gabrielhardman where are you going for sessions?
@andrealrosales as they say, IT WAS RIGHT THERE
@andrealrosales I believe the story had kid Jesus visit the modern day and go in a church- then find out what the Crucifix is and freak out and determine not to cast out guys selling doves
@ARTofCOOP and you will still throw them under the bus anyway
@andrealrosales oh, that one HURTS.
@allpaul @OhColeman the Office Killjoy strikes again!
“Should ElastiGirl be stretching or bending in this ad, maybe?” “No, why?” https://t.co/KPN4s8iIl9
@JonHexLives exactly
@HitlerPuncher @mudron it was the kid taking Jesus to the present day (he's a kid) and shows him a church, he finds out what the Crucifix is and says "NOPE" and stays a carpenter and the Devil wins.
@HitlerPuncher you heard me! It's like they would tackle Bible material, Black Mirror style
Its our Danish intern's last day and she just told us about a tv tradition they have that's like an Advent calendar story broken up over the month of December. One was a kid going back in time to stop Jesus
@mercuryeric sorry, I know you're still in your car
@TheKyleStarks I'm already saying that ghost-punch line,
@zdarsky, why
@KurtBusiek you Trumprolled them!
@mercuryeric sucks, but I do feel a bit worse for the truck driver!
@Jody_Houser same thing with me for Sorry To Bother You
@TheKyleStarks hey Mars Attacks is Real Good™
@ComicsNerdling it's got everything! NY retiree, Mobster, Aerospace, Disney, Gator- it needs an intermission
Good ol' Brain, treating every stray thought and joke as equal so I spent the whole dog walk thinking of numbers for 'Florida! The Musical'
@World_Of_Hurt @DarickR I also credit Stan Lee and PIZZAZZ magazine, which referenced WBK every single issue.
@DarickR sitting at a kitchen table while your husband does his stand-up material, not sure how much you need to laugh since there is a laugh track- what marriage should be.
@DarickR even being young I remember every episode ending with Kaplan sitting with his wife and subjecting her to his Groucho routines
@DarickR once modern audiences watch they'll never take our word on anything again, Darick
@dyfl this is going to be just one of the many callouts in the musical I'm writing, "Florida!"
@Robwilliams71 perfect, you gave it to him while he was all fresh and full of energy!
@liberalbastion we're the High Castle reality that other happier realities keep sending films of their world to, hoping we'll figure it out
@philhester like a chef
@Robwilliams71 that is incredible.
@PatrickZircher my son has been rereading our Popeye volumes and we were just talking about some of our favorite scenes. In my mind, it's still at the very top of comics, it's just as funny today as it was then.
@JamesUrbaniak this was great.

@Boilerplate1893 Happy Birthday Paul!

@THEKarlaPacheco feel like somebody hit me, in the stomach
dammit everyone, the word is exploiTAtive, I keep seeing 'exploitive' everywhere lately  same goes for Adaptation!

@ErikaMoen @LuBellWoo the best part: https://t.co/NWmUf7w9ZO
@TerryBlas I mean, it's practically law that you'll have to engage in duels when wearing it.
@EvieN and now I realize it too
@rusty_game the ultimate vacation goal.
@gabrielhardman I was worried that the ears were going to be stuck straight up like my dog's  (though it is a nice recognizable silhouette from far away) but it looks like all the options are still on the table.
@TerryBlas brave
@Cattifer weirdly, we didn't make any sweepotatoes this year.
@bigredrobot Jughead's Gang
@bigredrobot I hope everyone gets how jealous I am of them coming up with that line.
@bigredrobot then you'll never know the epic highs and lows of high school football
@gregpak @dyfl This was encouraging https://t.co/585Xty01qb  also news that the big ozone hole is repairing at a good pace. #MrPositive
@gregpak @dyfl also these new powers I've manifested.
@HopeLNicholson it's also wild how fast they could tell a story. One page, maybe two! Now that's compressed storytelling
@WinkelerComics right? Also they could scale it up like crazy now.
It seems like a perfect time to do another remake of THE BLOB.
@steve_lieber love too ship orders
@ClayRenfroe "Please stop sexing up my children's story" is quite a painful one. My son was disappointed too, as a big reader of it. Be nice if Disney made it as a tv series, like the way Series of Unfortunate Events got a new life.
If you managed to skip Thanksgiving here, you can pick up a turkey for ten bucks at any store now
@amandadeibert Pooey to them from me.
Reading those notes Rick Riordan sent to Fox about the adaptations of his books is a real bummer. Many studios take the term 'source material' pretty loosely
@kalebhorton will do!
@kalebhorton only Campbell's original though, everyone else's version is mostly terrible. I thought REM's was pretty bad and then I heard Dwight Yoakum's with the drum machine and threw whatever I was holding
@kalebhorton a buddy was interviewing Bob Mould a few years back and asked if I wanted to put in a question, mine was 'what makes Wichita Lineman such a great song?' It was a perfect ringer, Mould went on and on about it. If that song doesn't transport you, you're dead inside
@bookswpictures @slicedfriedgold @inkandpen @douglaswolk I remember when he showed it to me a while back, it does look very promising
@slicedfriedgold @bookswpictures @inkandpen @douglaswolk Listening to this now and got to the part where Katie talks about the new POS system- isn't that New Zealand Stu's app?  -Oops, now you're talking about sex toys
@ARTofCOOP @Kevin_Church did he keep telling them they were 'ossum'
@Plustenstrength this is a line in the sand.
@alex_segura there was definitely something going on with Ms Needleman, also she is fancy
@gabrielhardman Zita's so young and already a Bark Ranger!
@CharlieChu we could call it "TRUTH" maybe!
@bobbyrobertspdx as I said; no Paulie's Robot, no Parker in the seats
@MikeMeltzer Hot Topic went All Nerd, Spencers is the one that defies explanation
@David_Hahn I know somewhere you're saying out loud 'does-anyone-knowthe-true-meaning--of Christ-mas?'
@David_Hahn like at the Paywall Street Journal or LpAy Times
@tomfowlerbug I can visualize it.
@Robwilliams71 rooting for you!
@OhColeman and Conan zinged Ricky for being out of breath!
@taterpie water maybe- not the other things you NEED to be able to go through
@taterpie viiiiiiiinnnneeesssss
@taterpie @tomfowlerbug I trash people I LIKE in there, that place is a wasteland!
@taterpie @tomfowlerbug I thought it was you because we trash so many people in DM! I was saying to whoever that I thought he'd make into that timeline of Comics gape, remembering when he'd tweet awful shit at Laura Hudson and things like that.
@ibrill @PaulAllor he already looked different by three or four years later. I credit that 60s subculture!
@Cattifer yeah but this time its going to be live action
@CharlieChu joke's on them, we're not going to want to read one more damn word about that fool once we don't have to
@xtop having a digestive tract that's only 12 feet long pays off, for dogs
@JAMALIGLE ugh! An old friend was trying to find me on FB and since I deleted my account, the only thing he found was a video railing on my anti-machine gun story. Another "who are these assholes?" discovery
@DanSchkade The New Deal by @Jonathan_Case is a great one that LJ fans would love
@uzionmain I still keep thinking about how they played the whole damn song
@JAMALIGLE my favorite addition used to be wrapping with Fat Albert's quiet "hey hey hey." But that's been tainted now.  ah, I'm still gonna do it, hey hey hey
@taterpie I like Conan pointing out that RJ was winded from throwing some cards
we all know there's going to be a lot of magicians doing annoying shit at Ricky Jay's funeral
@Robwilliams71 oh ho ho!
@taterpie I knew Jack wouldn't get rid of the Like button, it's too important to the algorithm.
@ZackDavisson @jesse_hamm you're right!
@marcandreyko oh no!
@bigredrobot he seemed fine with all of it as long as he got to play a couple of numbers during the episode and he DID.
@jesse_hamm "mother he's down here making mad love to me!"
@bigredrobot also props to Cash straight up playing a villain going for underaged girls with no compunction
@bigredrobot hey little buddy!
@highway_62 hey who dat
@HelioscopePDX Who left several *cases* of KOOL-AID JAMMERS on my desk?
@Alejandrobot that dawg is hawt
@McLauchlin water bottles are BACK
@dowlster exactly. Why would you not get to her having a show, where she became mega famous? And as you say, that could have all kinds of great possibilities.
@AlanGMorton good ol' hot water, it's there for ya
@TomTaylorMade @Jody_Houser solid list, Jody! Especially w Edge of Tomorrow in there
@nicRDe rub it in!
@sidewaysburnout I bet that's what most people think when they see one in the drugstore
@carolynmain very true. Thanks CM
Where’s my people who break out the hot water bottle when winter starts in, sound off https://t.co/sJWaHvYeBN
@zacksoto even she seems to feel bad about taking up time in it, or maybe I read that into it
@RobotJQ I love it SO much
@DieRobinsonDie the old "League of Their Own" ending
@JSPartisan they're great every time! Why in the world would you take the camera off them
weirdest of all we barely see Julia cook!
@JSPartisan Yeah, I got the kid angle, but it really isn't utilized, I feel
@DieRobinsonDie and it's no mystery, of course she would! Like Barks and Rosa
@RobotJQ Yeah, I'm an Adams fan but those parts bring nothing to the table, so to speak
full of weird choices too- for some reason it brings in Julia Child's sister and shows her meet a man and get married, which impacts Julia's story in no way except to have her parents show up briefly. Okay, sure
Watched Julie and Julia and its baffling to me that Nora Ephron didn't just make a movie about Child, like the audience was going to get invested in a blogger
@sequentialmatt family regain
@JG_JONESfanpage looks great!
@JG_JONESfanpage I meant, were you going to post it here!

@steve_lieber we've got to get someone to make new clothes for him.
It's simple; if CREED 2 brings back Paulie's Robot I will go see it, if not I won't
@marissadraws @andykhouri this is how we all end up living on a train and eating babies.
@TerryDodsonArt that's wisdom.
@frankmartinbox okay, but cool lizards, right?
@RobotJQ it's brilliant and should be a poster, or at least a print at your table
@monkey__marc https://t.co/XB0PLKVva1
@NateCosBOOM @monkey__marc @sanya01 @RobotJQ @jordantboyd @SimonBowland @DynamiteComics that's great, hadn't seen that one!
@frankmartinbox that looks great! I bet there's a waterfall somewhere
and look at this wartime poster variant by @RobotJQ it's the BEST https://t.co/nWEbEgDpqB
ask the shop to hold this one for you, we're proud of it. https://t.co/JYYZ6l3hWt
@ibrill and Werner Klemperer!
@OhColeman enjoy!
another Thanksgiving down, and I still don't know why we all tend to have this giant meal at some weird time like 3 in the afternoon. A question for next year
@gabrielhardman this sounds like a plan for me too
@Matt_Grigsby Do not, my friends, become addicted to gravy- it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence!
@KurtBusiek @hotelfred @ErikJLarsen imagine a happier world where Bourdain is still alive and decides to take up the calling.
@sandy_jarrell @Ben_Abernathy 'they play so fine, don't you agree'
@BrianChurilla maybe it will make some other missionaries think a little harder
@BrianChurilla that guy was from here! Over in Vancouver
Once again I remembered everything except that I need to get a new Gravy Boat 🚣‍♂️  Now everyone has to spoon gravy out of a bowl instead of nautical ware, like savages
@ShesGotMoxieLMH @McLauchlin Thanks!
@McLauchlin Made cranberries w orange and about to fry the turkey
@JonHexLives whoa, you're not supposed to mash them THAT much
@David_Hahn I always have to credit Angelo Torres being the first person to point that out, messing up Al Williamson's whole week
Sure an’ we’ll be havin’ mashed p’tatas https://t.co/tyNYXSvRKV
@laura_hudson when my mother in law lived with us for a while, we would BOIL in winter
@David_Hahn He must be in there, there's a giant door in that wall
@ThatWeissGuy @heythisisbrian I believe he began by singing a Jesus song to them, and someone immediately shot an arrow at his bible
Just saying- if someone tells me don't go to that island, the people there were almost wiped out by exposure to outsiders and now they will shoot visitors full of arrows, I'm like "Got it."
@ErikaMoen we will not be using that hashtag thank you very much
@McLauchlin and there's so many now no one can remember their names anyway
@laura_hudson did you bring a flashlight to read comics under the sheet by
@DavidPrecht I don't usually see Jeeps at the rental places
@NicolaScottArt also, never pitch on social media!
@cheryllynneaton stay strong sis
@tomgurg I do, but I'm still trying to clean this house! Will chime in in the next couple of days
@EmCeeArtist street cred!
@THEKarlaPacheco it doesn't make sense to start breaking out your old drinking game gestures though #Thumper
@THEKarlaPacheco I've got a good guess at the particular gesture
@McKelvie SOLD!
@McKelvie you have to research each haunting and decide if a particular ghost suits your family's style
@THEKarlaPacheco aside from the punches, the whole scene still looks very choreographed to me, everyone waiting for their turn. Folks lose their minds over a continuous shot!
How often does the populous of Gotham City get diarrhea from Joker's constant water-supply meddling

I don't get it, does ALL Romaine in this country come from the same place?   (Parker, about to find out an unsettling Farm-fact)
@Cattifer I'll save you some, I got a big one and most everyone we have over tomorrow is vegetarian.
If AR-15s gave people embarrassing poops, THEN we as a nation would act quickly. https://t.co/n3cEaN8Acg
@shutupdougan as soon as everyone hears I fry them its the same bunch of jokes about explosions. Which is because I guess a lot of people drop a frozen turkey in the oil. They probably try to bake without thawing too but with less chaotic results
time to make my yearly promise to everyone that I will not use gasoline instead of peanut oil to fry my turkey.

@daveexmachina as if I didn't like her enough he associates her with Veruca, the most talented kid in Willy Wonka? $old!
T-Tip: start eating extra portions with your meals for the next two days so you don't injure yourself this Thursday
@MattBors I will never tire of this joke so keep it comin'
@AdamSMessinger ugh, sorry Adam! I'll look.
@daveexmachina the real win here is how you used Mute AND Moot in the same tweet.
@AdamSMessinger it comes in to my inbox- did I miss one from you?
@mrpolonog what have I wrought! :)
@fuzzytypewriter @JAFlanagan making them sit outside in an old wreck is a total power move

@emibot @ZackDavisson https://t.co/ztdvJQzw4F
@OhColeman #Professional
@emibot well, if you cram it right into potatoes and stuff immediately, I suppose
@OhColeman @Cattifer then I'll make sauce and pour it into a can to cool so it has that delicious shape
@THEKarlaPacheco @taterpie no, you're *hot* garbage, buddy!
@Ben_Abernathy @sandy_jarrell I was giving it to friends on Halloween and everyone loved it, as would you
@THEKarlaPacheco @taterpie people are garbage!
@PRTejeda it's SO easy!
@Cyberjaeger oh sure!
@PRTejeda I've heard people do that, the weird thing is some people actually like the canned kind 😖
@scrawfish @Horrorellablog I like how you see Fraser (at the height of his powers!) in the 70s getting his kid to watch Frankenstein.
@taterpie I might! It totally works
Picked up a turkey, a zillion potatoes, and cranberries. My sympathies to everyone with that one 'nostalgic' guest who *must* have can-shaped cranberry sauce
@gregpak do you not enjoy weird followers embarrassing you with their replies that include you and the other tweeter?

@ErikaMoen @RonDanChan @HelioscopePDX holy cow, she's morphed into another dog
@mattwieringo she raised thoughtful boys.
@Manruss heh, other people at school think Zan sux
@mloehrer yeah, they namecheck her right after she walks off and I was like WAIT, GO BACK I WASNT LOOKING
@Alex_Antone "Slaaaaade."
@PatrickZircher all charm is relegated to Jude Law, who's great at it, but he's not the point character.
@PatrickZircher also lots of odd choices- when it opens there's a lot of way-too-close camera work. I thought maybe it's supposed to represent Newt looking directly at people now and how weird it is for him? But if so it isn't clear
@PatrickZircher my boy was Newt for Halloween! Weirdly, the movie struggles to give Newt things to do, it's not really about Fantastic Beasts anymore.
@PatrickZircher the second one could have used a double dose of Goldman! Like a lot of comics crossovers, the characters are mercilessly pushed around through the plot instead of driving it.
@TheSickness85 @HitlerPuncher superlative thinking always bites us
@HitlerPuncher I was wondering after the last one- which was great, again- when will the haters show up? They must be on the way
@JoelGHodgson As well it should!
@DocShaner Malfoy deserved the Oscar!
@larrydigital do any of them really age differently from Muggles?
@DocShaner that's the ONE thing that could have brought this movie to life and they had plenty of opportunity to do it
Took son to Crimes of Grindelwald. Very much a "middle" movie. Terrific cast, but it pushes them along through its plot and keeps forgetting to be enjoyable. All the charm is hoarded by Jude Law, who feels like Richard Harris' Dumbledore.
@ed_solomon (applause)!
@martynpedler when they're ready to get serious about cinema.
@David_Hahn @bigplastichead Never heard that one, but I remember you saying it after Karl was talking about their tandem
We moved across the street and now they’re chattering about sin on a mic and killing all the business at the empanadas cart
My daughter is busking w violin ate the waterfront to raise money for a big trip. Was going well until these guys handing out Jack Chic tracts showed up and started scaring off all the music appreciators 😏
@chance_second @Tallychyck Live Burns are best.

@sandy_jarrell terrific!

@NicolaScottArt the uh, age I am RIGHT NOW
All honesty, though I say I would deliver a stinging rebuke to Maher if I ever met him, in reality I would bring up this episode of Politically Incorrect and ask what was said when they went to break right then. THEN my sick burn https://t.co/Do5z6d2wfE
@stevestar87 @TomTaylorMade @maguirekevin @sinKEVitch I have tried so often to find a clip of it and can't. It was mid 90s
@stevestar87 @TomTaylorMade @maguirekevin @sinKEVitch actually, Harlan was on his show back in the days when he was less a blowhard. I can't forget it because Maher made some (complimentary) joke about Harlan's virility, and Harlan acted odd then said, "I don't have a penis." It stopped the panel COLD.
@bnacker oh man
@BrianChurilla yes, I left out the best part!
@maguirekevin CHAYKIN
@taterpie some of my favorite lines lately have been when Eleanor pronounces it "Jif" and the Hemsworth brother refers to "TM-Zed"
@taterpie that's hardly a spoiler!
@taterpie going to watch it tomorrow!
@taterpie it's the same with Eleanor though, that's where they overlap.
@taterpie I liked being reminded of how evil Michael was, Chidi in the purple blob cracked me up
@Manruss mumbling 'lodestar' in his fitful sleep

@bigredrobot Grease is "problematic"
@jesse_hamm high-fives
@DavePorta1 @bigredrobot I think they’re pretty! But they irritate my cells.
@cheryllynneaton also like how Mary is doing the Mr. Roper and looking towards us as she lies
@cheryllynneaton oh man, they're drawing him just like Carl in UP
@taterpie @cheryllynneaton yes
@cheryllynneaton Mary will just buy some damn tires to get someone near the shelter, and he will just ride along to watch some tires be put on

@xtop she's so flippin cute, even for a cop
@culturepulp the subject of Stanich's comes up all the time over here. I didn't go there that much but I can't stand not having the option! I liked the tuna melt.
@azalben People around this neighborhood are constantly grumbling and wondering about if it will ever open again. It was a solid place!
@kibblesmith this tweet really messed with me because my first thought was "what, BP came out two years ago"  TrumpTime has wrecked my sense of when things happened.

@frankmartinbox why is every country ahead of us on everything! :)
@ARTofCOOP it would be nice if Affleck and Damon did a special thanks to him for launching their careers with that screenplay Oscar

Goldman! Read his books about working in movies if you haven't, they're great. https://t.co/MVkwUPQGcV
@DeanWhiteColor So sorry for your family, Dean.
@Manruss @GailSimone I did it because they wouldn't print my Chipotle fiction like Jonathan Safran Foer.

@jkgreenwood_art @steve_lieber you're drawing it J
@PatrickZircher Tom Laughlin was an ... interesting dude.
@OhColeman that's the best I can come up with too. And she knew he'd be dumb enough to keep rolling
Remembered that earlier today I heard a loud rumbling noise and looked outside to see a car with *all four tires* flat, driving down the street. Frustrated that I couldn't reverse-engineer that story
@xtop how much does she weigh now?
Just as I'm thinking how the world has changed so dramatically from when I was a kid, I hear my 13 year-old working on Sunshine Of Your Love with his bass
@xtop still, squirrels bad
@OhColeman this is tough, a very good bracket
@DarickR exactly.
@DarickR he sure wasn't MY frontrunner. I don't want any more people who have never held an office and definitely no more assaulters

@bigredrobot @andykhouri "Camp Dyl-Kill"
@andykhouri @bigredrobot it's winter time shenanigans. The cub troop I was in as a kid did nothing fun even though we lived around all these great trails. My kid got to do all kinds of cool camping and hikes (and then I did too)
@bigredrobot @andykhouri yeah, those are garbage. Scouts are always trying to find something else that gets kids fired up like the derbies, but the regatta and that 'rocket' derby never do it. They should just go fire Estes rockets, it's actual fun
@bigredrobot I got a digital scale
@bigredrobot wait, I was just there how I was not brought in on this
@andykhouri I'm actually okay with these people realizing everyone can find them and what they say has consequences
@themikenorton ah, that's too much too. Probably just go get a beverage
@Bob_of_Skull @NC_Comicon @DocShaner Not that I know of- this is a look back at that, and other books we did.
@hermanos everyone is supposed to just lay down and take it, I guess. Or they could be made to imagine 'oh, they could flip my car over with me in it'

@jason1749 that was the best one yet.
@emibot thanks! I want to see it but I'll be out of town later this week. But now I'll have plenty of chances.
@emibot for how long, Emi?
@leiladelduca @tulalotay hey that's real good

A great Rockwell piece, but the polls tomorrow shouldn't look like a 1944 illo for Saturday Evening Post. They should look more like Rockwell's "Right To Know" from 1968 in my header https://t.co/EdmCiwdvSj

@BaddWolfeHowlin congrats Sean!
@ThatStevenGrant @KurtBelcher I first saw him in a manners-comedy called Cold Comfort Farm, he was good even then
@craigrousseau you've already burned through it? You were supposed to be watching Hill House like me!
Yes. We can all put up with a few phone calls and tweets asking if we've voted. https://t.co/ONhnZeJTHB
@nikdirga It's not much like the book afaik, but I like the show. The first season takes a while to get going and then it's engaging.
@seankmckeever Yes!
@tomfowlerbug @Kevin_Church like Kingdom Come Batman.
back on that High Castle, just watched episode one of the new season
@CharlieChu CRUZ rhymes with LOSE  okay I'm done now

@Chrispy2143 @NC_Comicon hey I'm up for whatever Chris
@ShanaTargosz @CharlieChu I don't know ANYONE who picks up unrecognized calls anymore, either.
@CharlieChu that's what I've been think-hoping too.
@taterpie I like the sets a lot!
@taterpie yes but I sat down while my son was watching the last one, I need to go back
@andykhouri @DavidUzumeri @curtofranklin @dyfl it's a typical middling biopic.

@awalrusdarkly @heysarahsweeney In my mind the guy is already building a rep as "The Zillow Killer"
@ThatStevenGrant @KurtBusiek For a split second you had me seeing an alternate reality where Arizona has a D Governor!
@ThatStevenGrant our Dem gov
@ThatStevenGrant the independent running for governor just did that here, it's a close race
@kenlowery @taterpie at the very least, not come out making jokes about losing millions
@CharlieChu this is the worst episode of Parks and Rec

@azmattu Yes! The Abigail bit was clever
@bigredrobot oh hey I'm coming to town tomorrow and hell's coming with me
@bigredrobot but they also saw YOU, and started sweatin'
@azmattu Update: I liked it! Thought it was a solid conclusion.
I felt awful earlier but my pal @ErikaMoen got me out of my head and then I enjoyed Halloween.

@Ben_Abernathy later I'll put up pics of what Justin and I rigged up outside
@epascalides they REALLY want to get the message across about cheese being involved
@rusty_game wow, he really is on a timeline.
@ghweldon hey congrats on sticking "All Hallows Steve" in my damn head, there to announce itself every time I see someone say the original name
@DialHForHagai congratulations!
@Kevin_Church "dammit, me about to crack case wide open, no pull!"
Usually I'm pretty indulgent with the dog, letting him sniff around on our walks but this morning its like he was working a murder case.
@caitlike ugh, why is the end time so late at night
@Manruss he'll think he's fled the country but like his hero, he'll find out Puerto Rico is actually part of the US.
@AmyChu Larry is the Best.
@brihurtt @MrTylerCrook news should go back to being on for only an hour and TV should go off at 1 in the morning again.
@BrianChurilla where is it?

@ScooterHarris @carlreiner you and me both!
@Chrispy2143 @NC_Comicon sure will- I usually do a character for about 60. Bring books for m' signin' hand too
@MrTylerCrook I'm with ya, buddy.
@MrTylerCrook I'm pushing the hashtag #TheLastElection
@mattsouthworth make Warshington safe
@EvieN I always love that he begins listing the history from the year HE was born
@shawnaldridge I can't enjoy those scenes because I feel bad for Sally missing out on Halloween, it's like she went to one of those Christian haunted houses by accident.
Even more than I want it for myself, I want @carlreiner to see the change he hopes for. https://t.co/cKtfQGH4EZ
@shawnaldridge Linus is a flippin zealot.
@sanfordgreene @repjohnlewis Greatness.

@Robwilliams71 I'll fave this, but it's largely because I have to use up my faves since they're now finite
@tweetachromat I'm pretty big on fixing things instead of buying new, so I'm quite happy
@PjPerez oh what a difference! Programs open up like magic
@ZackDavisson @xtop yeah Ross always surprises me the random stuff it can have
@xtop the ones at GC are about 12 bucks, Marty loves them
@sharkieQ pretty much!
@PjPerez it's an ol' macbook pro 2012
@xtop Grocery Outlet has some cheap but comfy dog beds.
My computer was dying a pinwheel death, and today I had a new solid state 1-terrabyte drive put in it, and now I wield the power cosmic, basically.
After a weekend job, back to Hauntin' of Hill House, episode 8. I'm on schedule to finish on Halloween!
@RobotJQ totally different you see, theirs is BREWS and Boos
@RobotJQ THANK you. Was listening to Boos n Brews last night. Also saw the copycat sight, they even did a riff on your logo!
@jrobertdeans @Jonathan_Case you have to read through the site!
@Jonathan_Case It looks terrific, nice job! PS I was the old man who flipped you all off
@jessnevins I loved the Air &amp; Space when I was that age.
@thetonyisabella Tony thanks for the '66 review!
@heythisisbrian it's Billy-Bass terrifying.
@SongbirdDiamond @bryanedwardhill I probably said something about considering more how I did it, if I said that I’ve failed miserably since!
The human skeletons pleasuring themselves with pumpkins IS the spirit of Halloween though
@SongbirdDiamond @bryanedwardhill What’d I do
I love dinosaurs and appreciate anyone who decorates for the best holiday, but this suggests you don’t Get Halloween https://t.co/6Kz8sSJ2fe
@mattsouthworth The statue is going to shake its head and leave Rio
@steve_lieber @comicconla The BEST

@tomfowlerbug Stupid rock.
@dyfl @chrise17 If you come back together then get WB to hook you up w tickets to the studio tour, that will cover him for LIFE.
@HiThere144 @chrissteinplays Why are you awake right now?
@HiThere144 @chrissteinplays Well, I feel he stokes the fire for antisemitism, James. He rants about Soros and ‘globalists’ which are very common dog whistles for blaming things on Jews.
@HiThere144 @chrissteinplays The President, usually- for the rest of THE DAY,  unless massacres are now no big whoop apparently
@tomfowlerbug It’s great seeing these again!!

@TheChrisGlass yeah, I imagine it's better to look like 'we got nothin'
Heard on the radio that the #MAGABomber (s?) targeted Joe Biden and... Robert De Niro. This is a lot of packages, the FBI must have something to work with by now, at least the locations mailed from and video there.
@EvNarc he sure loves theoretical coffee!
@Ben_Abernathy that is how it's DONE.
@jameslucasjones -whew-
@ThatStevenGrant I believe you, they're magical thinkers
@highway_62 @kalebhorton watch, the next time I'm there I'll see a venue named Hipster Coffee Place and be forced to eat my words
@ThatStevenGrant sure, nothing about it really works how he says. I mainly wanted to point out some gross incompetence while I was marveling at the flood of horror. Really, what they've probably heard him talk about is nothing but legal landmines
@kalebhorton but were you in "downtown" where all people in L.A. go for coffee
The #MAGABomber, the Justice Dept. pushing the Supreme Court to let businesses discriminate by orientation, and a Trade War we can't win because China hears every Trump phone call. This news cycle gets more hellish by the HOUR.
@greyallison I'd say... yes?
@PaulAllor @BenjaminDewey @LindserAnnie @steve_lieber well done Paul.
@RamonVillalobos you taught me that every hero has a shoe specific to their nature #Ramonloveswhites

@j_cohl Jonny will straight up knife a fool, especially at Christmas
@jpalmiotti @MitchGerads I had them when I was 18, I barfed up BILE. It felt like broken glass going through my side, and I get freaked out still, like Mitch describes.
@timnelsonPDX I had a book to return, thank you
@moiseschiu definitely on the up and up!
@xtop that's all the chance you get when he's scootin' https://t.co/K3k2tWFFLu
@moiseschiu it was for sure a phishing scam and not tech support for an app?
@moiseschiu maybe the Activity Monitor would show any surreptitiously added program running in the background?
@KurtBelcher haha
@IvanBrandon not that Luke!
I thought this episode of THOHH was going to explain why Luke doesn't need glasses as an adult
@TerriDrawsStuff I like the Lincoln statue- they're over on Park Row downtown. George is up at the former Masonic Lodge near me!
@TerriDrawsStuff they should have added a gorilla for Joan to be fighting while they were at it
@TerriDrawsStuff I had heard it was there for years just bronze and then gilded relatively recently (by which I mean within 30 or so years)
@TerriDrawsStuff it's a copy, not his original. The real question is why they felt the need to gild it
4th episode down of Haunting of Hill House, poor Luke 🎩  *they don't have a bowler hat emoji
@ARTofCOOP Why Mr. Cooper the high school closed its doors 30 years ago, no kids live around here

@PaulTobin Filled it out a while ago, going to drop it off tomorrow!
@storrieville @adampknave you're missing the best parts of being a shut-in, Storrie

@OhColeman you son of a bitch
@Ron_Randall this is nuts, you're the Kickstart King!
@xtop oh no, tell her to back off, she don't want trouble like that
@xtop good girl!

@David_Hahn David, thanks for giving that consideration.

@steve_lieber @Oregonian One of those random fights where you happen to have a bonesaw for cutting off fingers and limbs, and noise-reduction headphones to downplay the screaming before the fight is over.
