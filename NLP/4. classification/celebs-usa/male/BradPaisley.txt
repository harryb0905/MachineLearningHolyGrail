When the Nashville floods wiped out most of my guitars, Roy heard about it &amp; showed up at a show and gave me one of his. This is who this man was. Constantly giving. I owe him so much. Go say hi to my Papaw for me Roy. You left the world a much better place. #royclark https://t.co/Aus1110BsU
My story is not unique. How many guitar players started with a Roy Clark guitar method book? How many guitars were sold to people wanting to play because of him? How many lives were made better because of his wit and joy? I‚Äôm one of so many. https://t.co/jxE20oEW0S
Right before this moment  I was standing by Roy in the dark. I put my arm around him &amp; told him I loved him. We both teared up. Then the lights came on &amp; we delivered that iconic Hee Haw opening line at the CMA 50th. We will miss you so much Roy. https://t.co/zKMOdMehcg
Roy Clark shaped my path. My Papaw introduced me to his music as a toddler. Every Saturday we‚Äôd watch Hee Haw. My first guitar book was a Roy Clark guitar method. I practiced his style, then practiced making his facial expressions. He was a hero. And so many have the same story.

It's hilarious seeing tweets giving me crap for any picks I got wrong. Fair enough. Most importantly, I got WVU right. And football's back!
And any loss by more than 10 points calls for something stronger than ice cream. http://t.co/0MFoyQIXZD
I very carefully reviewed the data and stats to arrive at such a conclusion. RT @steveshenbaum: Wise pick. Northwestern wins. Go Cats!
All y'all's teams winning out there? Yes? Wonderful then. Good work. No? Ice cream. Just do it.
And now we'll see how I do...

..then 5 beats 7. Who am I to stand in the way of excellent journalism? I mean,thats fair. And balanced.Right @DanaPerino @TheFive @foxnews
Thing is,my management/suits record launch plan focused on some 7pm Farm Report or somethin. If the news outlet about to leak starts at 5...

Oh crud, management is going to tan my hide. This is a mess. But to be fair, I can't stop the news from doing their job. #leakingmoonshine
Uh oh. A certain news channel has obtained the song I'm leaking tonight and is trying to scoop me. I'm gonna be in trouble#leakingmoonshine

Song choice is everything in a career. Love @JesseKinch &amp; now y'all shut up &amp; let me mentor him the best I can. I want him on the radio.
Didn't change a thing about his trajectory. Love y'all, love @JesseKinch. Song choice is everything in a career. Some fun, some serious.
And I want @Jessekinch playing stadiums and arenas.  Not bars. I'm right people. This is a speed bump on the way to stardom he will remember
I adore @jessekinch -but how does he sound on a ballad? Something like Gravity- Jmayer or modern rock like Kings of Leon? He can balance all
Okay look...RT @bmw545iluv: @JesseKinch Jealous, jealous, jealous jealous r u BP.  Hope u can't sleep tonight because of that red arrow!
When @JesseKinch goes to sleep tonight he will think about that red arrow. And if that makes him make great decisions later, hallelujah.
I also sang Whiskey Lullabye mother...RT @mstanley7557: Says a guy who made his bones singing about "Alcohol" and "Ticks."bp @JesseKinch

Ok,last night @Sonnetmusic told me her strength is songwriting. So before I leak anymore moonshine today, I'm gonna listen to Sonnet.
@BradPaisleyPlay won't be the same if you're not in the audience next week!!
Okay @Sonnetmusic we have a deal: You're going to send me an original song you wrote and recorded. Let's hear it!

Darn darn darn darn Darny darn darn!!!!!!!

See response. http://t.co/gKRvBPggsx
So you heard the man. Promote the song "Moonshine". Here we go. Buckle up. http://t.co/MG9KUGFIbm
My response. Sounds pretty clear to me. http://t.co/6jq0bS38jm
Got this from the head of the label.. Seems pretty clear to me. http://t.co/FmwPWRkFj4
Wait I got an email I gotta read...
I want this record presented to you in the spirit it was made; smuggled in a car across a dry county. So...what to do what to do.
Let me say: I love recording at Sony. I love my manager, my publicist, my agent. But yes, I'm doing this largely on my own.
Which bible verse is "Finders keepers, losers weepers"? I can't seem to find it.
I am so proud of my sister in law &amp; I love Jim Gaffigan. I can't wait. Let's leak it early! RT @ash30: KA-BLAMO http://t.co/yfEoR35BpW
And welcome to the rebellion @DaveRamsey ! Better than I deserve.  #leakingmoonshine
RT @DaveRamsey:Don't like banks,but got nothing against Brad @coltford or River Banks-love the song#leakingmoonshine http://t.co/ZF744uFamL
And @mrBobbyBones and @coltford can't tweet the YouTube  link for this remix either. The YouTube link for RiverBank Rip Rap. Can't. Not us.
Again, I can't tweet the link to the @coltford Remix of RiverBank. Which exists.
So, here's the thing,my management has very good reasons why I can't tweet the link yet to the @coltford RiverBank remix. Sorry.
Yeah me too. @Monicasel
Here's how I see it @coltford @mrBobbyBones - River Bank is not only a summer party song, it is sound financial planning advice...
So I have an idea @mrBobbyBones -we need someone that's not in OUR industry to post the @coltford remix.They can't make them take it down...
We will have the last laugh @mrBobbyBones , trust me.
@mrBobbyBones is the link down?
Cooking up something. Won't be tonight though. Thanks @peoplemag for the collaboration in anarchy today. Night! http://t.co/QIj1Oo5rCE
So what do ya wanna hear next? #leakingmoonshine
Wait it's still up! I had the wrong one. I'm paranoid. And an idiot. http://t.co/968CIDYPMJ
Looks like they blocked the link at @peoplemag again
New link! Crushin it! Hurry. http://t.co/968CIDYPMJ
When are the powers that be going to give up and allow me to be the wild and free ghost panther I was born to be? Ha! Hang on.
I bet the Suits blocked the link. Don't worry, we'll get another. But listen fast when I tweet it. Won't last long I bet.
Well so much for all that talk about the Free Press!
The video is blocked already? @peoplemag
God bless the free press &amp; the 1st Ammendment. No removing this 1.We got the bill o rights on our side.Crush it ya'll http://t.co/ssvIGvQ2CO
Last night @ludacris was my accomplice. But when I tried to post "Crushin It" yesterday, it got taken down . Hey @peoplemag You ready?
So you wouldn't believe the conversations that were had today about my actions. Problem is, I'm a terrible listener. So...
I'm seeing an outcry for a re-edited video with @coltford in a wet t-shirt. Whatdya say big boy?http://t.co/kr2nTDfsdy
It's been an interesting day.

@wildhorseradio We'll get it to ya! And that's a good idea.
We can share a padded cell RT @mrBobbyBones: @coltford i think they are mostly afraid we were both going to get fired. but thumbs up
Whoops. Here we go again. @coltford  http://t.co/G09uRushMA
Told ya me and @coltford had something fun for y'all. How'd they like it @mrBobbyBones ?
Me too RT @P_Wunder: I wonder how much trouble @BradPaisley is in today. #MoonshineInTheTrunk
No one has been as inspiring as @KarenHornsby to me on our show. So much respect.
RT @Ludacris: Check this link out -new album @bradpaisley¬†Can't wait to see how these fit into the record! http://t.co/aNSjbHpY02
Again, I promised the label I wouldn't post the link myself. Me. Myself. I.
I'd love to post another clip of music, but they're watching me like a hawk but I'll bet they're not watching @ludacris ...
See my response to the label here... http://t.co/htJgowrTFc
