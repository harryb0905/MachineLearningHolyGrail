On potential nuclear agreement at #TrumpKimSummit @realDonaldTrump "It's a deal. Who knows. You never know about deals. You go into deals that are 100% certain - it doesn't happen. You go into deals that have no chance and sometimes, it happens easily."
On #TrumpKimSummit @realDonaldTrump "There are certain conditions that we want and I think we'll get those conditions and if we don't, we don't have the meeting...If it doesn't happen, maybe it'll happen later. Maybe it will happen at a different time."

We asked @SecNielsen three times if she wrote a resignation letter in response to @realDonaldTrump criticism. She did not reply.
Via @SecNielsen on #DischargePetition "I am supportive of anybody who wants to try to fix border security and a broken immigration system. I've had lots of conversations (w GOP leaders) the last few days. The president has as well. We'll continue to work with leadership."
More from @SecNielsen on GOP-led Congress not moving on @realDonaldTrump immigration demands. "I think it's a timing issue, meaning that they are just never in session. Right. They take lots of recesses. They have other things to do. We've encouraged them to stay in session."
To reporters just now @SecNielsen  on relationship w @realDonaldTrump "We have a very strong relationship. I think what is true is we are both really frustrated. We need Congress to act. The law is broken." Was #POTUS frustrated with your leadership? "Not that I believe so, no."
On @stevenmnuchin1 discord with Navarro @larry_kudlow "It's all a lot of gossip. Okay! Differences of opinion. We're a democratic country. We got a big team. A lot of smart people and you're going to have discussions. I just don't want to go there."
More on #China via @larry_kudlow "I think we're going to see discussion on industries and sectors that will be opened up to American exports. This will be industrial, technology, financial openings. We gave them a lengthy, detailed list of areas where we want trade openings."
As far as talks @realDonaldTrump will meet today at #WhiteHouse with Chinese trade leader, Vice Premier Liu He -- for U.S. team, @larry_kudlow says @stevenmnuchin1 running point &amp; Navarro (trade adviser) will attend. Kudlow on Navarro: "He'a a member of our team and a smart guy"
On trade talks with #China @larry_kudlow "This is a great opportunity for us to move the ball in the right direction and the Chinese seem amenable and we are expecting some documents from them, some new proposals. I'm sure this is going to be a lengthy process."
Just now @larry_kudlow on #ZTE "The president is responding to a request from President Xi to take another look at it. That's what we're doing. Secretary Ross...has always regarded this as an enforcement issue, not a trade issue. They will take a look at the remedies."
+ @PressSec on @AmbJohnBolton and "Libya model"  -- "There is not a cookie cutter model of how this works. This is the President Trump model he‚Äôs going to run this the way he sees fit. He‚Äôs the best negotiator." What Bolton said: https://t.co/TDYBmcS1KT
Just now asked @PressSec about @AmbJohnBolton @FaceTheNation remarks on "Libya model" for North Korea nuke talks. Her response:" I haven‚Äôt seen that as part of any discussions‚Ä¶.I am not aware that that is a model that we are using." More to come.

Via @POTUS ‚ÄúAs a wife, mother, grandmother, military spouse, and former First Lady, Mrs. Bush was an advocate of the American family. Amongst her greatest achievements was recognizing the importance of literacy as a fundamental family value that requires nurturing and protection‚Äù
