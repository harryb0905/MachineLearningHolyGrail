With that being said- if you want an interview hit up @erikanswerman
ive done interviews for high school students, blogs with 10 to millions of viewers- i respect all bloggers and journalists with integrity
Att blogs- dont charge artists for interviews- ur site will not be taken seriously- write compelling articles, draw in a fan base &amp; sell ads
when you charge for an interview, ur journalistic integrity is immediately compromised- @RunninWithIt
find a niche, write informative articles that increase your viewers than charge for advertising when you build a base- @RunninWithIt
whats good yank? that dude is a joker @djyank
take my song of ur fucking site @RunninWithIt
