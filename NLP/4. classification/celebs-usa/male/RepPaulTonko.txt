President Trump's clean air chief was a lawyer for a shady coal industry group right before &amp; continues to meet w/ industry lobbyists over objections of ethics officials.   He says that's ethical as long as there are at least five people at any meeting. üßê https://t.co/sY6ATWGHBQ

@realDonaldTrump "...that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."  222 House co-sponsors have signed on to end President Trump's #FakeEmergency. I'm one of them. https://t.co/BDjYUtpTNh
U.S. military leaders and our intelligence community keep telling us that climate change and its consequences are a major national security threat. President Trump continues to look for ways to ignore this reality and his duty to act. https://t.co/drEdkwRVCb
Critical forecasting happens at our @NWSAlbany office. As the climate crisis grows, @NWS forecasting will be even more vital. 3-4 years of training to do this job but severe staffing shortages &amp; a 35-day shutdown left jobs unfilled &amp; folks being thrown in straight out of college. https://t.co/U5877B6Pih
.@realDonaldTrump failed to convince Mexico, the American people or Congress to pay for his massive, misguided border wall. Now he's working feverishly to undermine the rule of law that has long protected our American republic.   I'm signing on to end this #FakeEmergency now.
This president is declaring an emergency over a crisis that doesn‚Äôt exist, even saying today that he ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt need to do this‚Äô.   Meanwhile illegal border crossings continue their long downward trend from already historic lows. https://t.co/YbPWXywqMz #FakeTrumpEmergency
If he chooses to continue this foolishness, it would only prove that, given the chance to listen to the people and govern with reason and common sense, this President prefers to run head-first into his own wall.
Whatever he chooses to do from here, Congress and the American people have been absolutely clear with the President that he is alone in this misguided quest to build a vast &amp; ineffective border wall.
I'm dubious about some of this agreement, but that's compromise. In the end, this deal funds important priorities for our national security &amp; economy, resolves uncertainty for vital agencies and workers, and should finally end the threat of another pointless government shutdown.

For your list of this President's broken promises:   The #TrumpTaxScam: - didn't make filing taxes easier - didn't pay for itself - didn't lead to major job &amp; wage growth - is actually cutting refunds &amp; raising taxes for millions of middle class Americans: https://t.co/cGMMOO8XVQ

‚ÄúIn 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Many of the jobs it is creating, it turns out, are in the tax industry... ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs created just a whole lot of new complexity and it‚Äôs given us mountains of new guidance to figure out and to deal with.‚Äô‚Äù https://t.co/WyyoaTawLC
"This line plot shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2018.... Though there are minor variations, all five temperature records show peaks &amp; valleys in sync with each other.

"Some of that heat came in the form of heat waves that took hundreds of lives. The heat also helped fuel record-breaking disasters, like the Camp Fire in California, that wiped out cities and left thousands homeless." https://t.co/uaj2BxFXEM
Bad enough that 2018 was the 4th hottest year on record. But #1-3 also came in the last five years.   This problem isn't going away on its own. We need to listen to the scientists, study the solutions that have been tried, and move forward with urgency &amp; resolve to #ActOnClimate.

We have to do better. My Democratic colleagues and I are working on a comprehensive framework to tackle climate change before it‚Äôs too late. This is a challenge we face across every sector of our economy and in nearly every aspect of our lives. We have to get it right this time.
Calling climate change a hoax doesn‚Äôt just ignore overwhelming &amp; diverse scientific evidence, it endangers the health, safety &amp; prosperity of the American people and all of humanity for generations to come, an astonishingly irresponsible thing for anyone in power to do.

In the words of former longtime New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan: ‚ÄúEveryone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts.‚Äù   President Trump wants us to forget the facts and who we are as a people. Thankfully we, the people, disagree.
This week and next we will be offering legislation to reopen those agencies one at a time to help ensure that home and business loans, tax refunds and other important services continue to be available to the American people.  There's really only one person standing in the way.
The House of Representatives reached bipartisan agreement last week in a vote to reopen federal agencies the President shut down and to restore paychecks to 800,000 workers. The week before, the Senate voted 100-0 to keep the government open. We are still working to find a way.
@DeptVetAffairs We also believe the symbol of our nation should be our Statue of Liberty, not a massive coast-to-coast border wall. https://t.co/GhqYZKDFPm
@DeptVetAffairs Fact: Democrats support strong borders &amp; oppose illegal immigration. We believe the best way to improve our security is to upgrade our ports of entry and invest in 21st century technology to address unauthorized crossings, and have long stood for comprehensive immigration reform.
@DeptVetAffairs Fact: President Trump has said numerous times during his presidency that he would like to shut down the government to build his wall, and said just before the current shutdown that he would proud to own this one too. https://t.co/eGSRTAwZjR
Fact: Mexico isn‚Äôt paying for this wall. $5 billion from taxpayers should fix real problems e.g. - Rebuild Flint‚Äôs water system &amp; 89 others - Modernize @DeptVetAffairs record system - 2x funding for mental health &amp; substance use programs - Cover 1.4 million Americans via Medicaid
Fact: The American people don‚Äôt want a border wall. It‚Äôs a 5th century solution to a 21st century problem. https://t.co/nQMjiiI9ds
Fact: Illegal immigration in the U.S. has been falling for years, including from Mexico. @CBP data shows that in FY 2017 border apprehensions hit their lowest level in four decades. https://t.co/sjj54y0sQc
President Trump has repeatedly misled and even outright lied to the American people about immigration and immigrants. We have tried to negotiate in good faith. He has proven untrustworthy. https://t.co/sbxxUPXyzm &amp; https://t.co/CQBtyqJj4y
Building walls doesn‚Äôt solve real immigration issues:  - Most illegal drugs come through ports - Most undocumented people in the country overstay visas and never cross the border illegally - Refugees aren‚Äôt terrorists, they are the victims of terrorists
Applicants for asylum are typically required to wear ankle monitors and work closely with caseworkers to ensure they show up for their asylum hearing. When done in a thoughtful, responsible way, their court appearance rate is at or near 100% https://t.co/wvMrbxPIoP

If there is a security and humanitarian crisis at our Southern border today, it has resulted from failure, mismanagement and inhumane treatment by this President and his Administration.
This #TrumpShutdown has hit critical national security agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, FBI and Drug Enforcement Agency, even the immigration courts responsible for ruling on deportations.
First, this needless government shutdown is already creating a drag on the economy, stopping countless home and business loans and paychecks for 800,000 federal workers, including 14,367 New Yorkers.
A few things to keep in mind as President Trump continues his fiction-filled push to keep the government closed and force taxpayers to build his ineffective border wall  1/

It's time for Congress and our federal government to get back to working for the people. We're getting started, but we can't do it alone. Your voices and organizing saved healthcare and woke a generation. Your actions make a huge difference.
Finally, H.R.1 strengthens ethics laws preventing conflicts of interest in public service, requires financial transparency at the highest levels of government, confronts the revolving door between Congress and private industry &amp; establishes a code of conduct for the Supreme Court
H.R.1 also confronts big money in politics by requiring disclosure of big donors, modernizing political advertising laws, setting up public matching for citizen-owned elections &amp; ensuring the Federal Election Commission is doing its job as a cop on the beat of campaign finance.
H.R.1 includes overdue electoral reforms that make it easier to vote including automatic voter registration, voting by mail &amp; early voting, as well as reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and safeguarding our elections by modernizing voting systems &amp; ending partisan redistricting.
I'm proud to cosponsor H.R.1: The For the People Act of 2019 designed to root out corruption in government and put the needs of the American people ahead of political and special interests that have gotten their way and gone unchecked for much too long.
.@RealDonaldTrump said he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù to shut down the government for his costly, ineffective border wall. Law enforcement officers, Forest Service firefighters, food safety inspectors &amp; many others have now gone for two weeks without a paycheck and there's still no end in sight.
Last night Democrats in the House voted to stand with 800,000 federal workers and end the #TrumpShutdown. Less than a month ago, a Republican-led Senate voted 100-0 to keep the government open. There is no excuse for Congress or President Trump to keep punishing these families.
Under recent Republican leadership, Congress worked to give the biggest breaks to the wealthy &amp; well-connected. It‚Äôs time for a change. My Democratic colleagues and I are advancing a new set of House rules that will clean up Washington and get Congress back to work #forthepeople.

President Trump forced our country into a shutdown with no plan to get us out of this mess. Now hundreds of thousands of families‚Äìincluding those of FBI, DEA, Secret Service &amp; border patrol agents and customs officers, Forest Service firefighters, food safety inspectors...
A new Congress gets sworn in today. Time to end this President‚Äôs tantrum-driven government shutdown and turn the page on an era of Republican-led governance by crisis that has done incredible harm to our national security and economic stability. #TrumpShutdown
Based on this estimate, some 14,360 New Yorkers have been sent home or asked to work in their federal public service jobs without pay during this #TrumpShutdown.   12 days and counting. https://t.co/mne8NXiGGw

We no longer have time to debate settled science. Climate change will cause massive economic and health harm to Americans in every region and industry. Heavy costs have already started hitting millions of Americans across every state. #ClimateFriday
Yearly costs from #ClimateChange could exceed $100 BILLION in the energy, agriculture &amp; health sectors by the end of the century. The White House tried to bury this finding last week, putting politics over the health and prosperity of the American people. #ClimateFriday https://t.co/z8sqUMJtnp

Today on International Day of the Girl, @girlscouts is honoring the remarkable 2018 National Gold Award Girl Scouts, including Caroline M. from Nikayuna, at a ceremony at the @UN. Congrats to these young women on being leaders who fought to change the world around them. #IDG2018
Good News for Social Security ‚Äì next year‚Äôs COLA will be 2.8 percent. But with the rising costs seniors face ‚Äì we need to strengthen Social Security. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm fighting to #ExpandSocialSecurity.
As a member of Congress, one of my top priorities has been improving our nation's mental healthcare system. For too long, mental health has carried a stigma that has slowed our progress toward improving services for those with mental health disorders. #WorldMentalHealthDay2018
As a longtime advocate for those with mental illness, I fought in the New York State Assembly to pass Timothy's Law, which ensured that New Yorkers with mental health concerns are treated on par with those seeking physical health care. #WorldMentalHealthDay2018
The @UN #ClimateChangeReport must be a wake-up call to Congress and #ToxicTrump. The time for #ClimateAction is NOW. The consequences of 2 degrees of warming could be devasting, permanent, and lasting for Americans, people across the world, and our planet. https://t.co/t5sFvaq1wx
Thank you to @EnergyPace for your work as the CHP TAP for NY &amp; NJ. And thank you to @AllianceIndEff, @ToSaveEnergy, @AmChemistry, and @ACEEEdc for supporting this critical DOE program. https://t.co/BUMhsZOWpy

For over 4 decades, DOE‚Äôs Weatherization Assistance Program has provided weatherization services to millions of low-income households, reducing electricity bills &amp; making homes healthier &amp; safer. Each $ invested in weatherization returns $4.10 to society in benefits #EEDay2018
Consumers put their trust in Energy Star because it saves them money on their utility bills. These products have saved consumers hundreds of billions of dollars since 1992. That is why I have worked to ensure the continued success of the Energy Star brand #EEDay2018 https://t.co/dQO5TfvUtr
In NYS #energyefficiency jobs comprise 12% of all construction jobs and 36% of all energy sector jobs. In NY-20 alone there are more than 5,000 #energyefficient jobs! #EEDay2018 @e2org @e4thefuture
Through #Energyefficiency, we can create jobs, innovate new technologies, save consumers money, and protect the environment all while reducing energy use. On #EEDay2018, I want to highlight a few federal programs that have made these efficiency gains possible.
Today is National Energy Efficiency Day. As a long time champion of energy efficiency and clean energy jobs, I believe that energy efficiency should be our fuel of choice. #energyefficiency #EEDay2018

When the President refuses to stand up to bullies like Vladimir Putin and defend American interests abroad, he is all but inviting future foreign inference in our democracy.   Today is a sad day for America.
For reasons he desperately needs to explain to the American people, President Trump refuses to acknowledge the clear and indisputable reality that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a foreign campaign to sabotage U.S. elections.

The Trump Administration has refused to uphold #ACA law, an issue likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has a history of rulings that suggest #healthcare for millions of Americans may hang in the balance with his nomination. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh
In recent months, the increasingly ideological Supreme Court has eroded many of these rights. If the President‚Äôs latest nominee is approved by the Senate, his push for an extreme and at times un-American agenda will only accelerate.
...to step up when Congress fails on issues such as gun violence prevention and environmental protections. We also believe as a nation that healthcare is a fundamental right for all Americans, including millions who are classified as having pre-existing conditions.
We have long upheld the rights of workers to join together to bargain for better wages and working conditions, the rights of women to make their own healthcare and reproductive choices, the rights of voters to express themselves through elections, and the rights of states...
Republicans stonewalled a Supreme Court nomination for more than a year, arguing that people have a right to be heard on such a consequential lifetime appointment. Now, with just 4 months until the midterm elections, Republican leaders are ignoring voters and their own precedent.
President Trump‚Äôs #SCOTUS nomination of Brett Kavanaugh extends his push to pack the court with extremists who support his misguided policies and will help insulate him from legal accountability for his past actions. The Senate should fulfill its Constitutional duty and decline.
I hope today‚Äôs long overdue announcement brings an end to a regrettable chapter in this great agency‚Äôs history. @EPA is critical to protecting our nation‚Äôs public health &amp; environment. It's my hope that the next Administrator will respect EPA‚Äôs mission &amp; its dedicated workforce.
He showed an incessant drive to enrich himself at the expense of US taxpayers &amp; federal ethics rules. When details of abuse of his position were reported, he failed to express the slightest contrition. Ultimately, he failed as a steward of US taxpayer dollars &amp; our environment.
Scott Pruitt proved time &amp; again that he was unfit to lead the @EPA.

Rural schools, businesses, farmers &amp; healthcare providers need high-speed #broadband to provide critical services to their communities and fend off international competition. The #GOPfarmbill still makes a mess of #ruralbroadband funding, leaving many of these communities behind.
Rural communities often struggle to secure capital for infrastructure and economic development. This #GOPfarmbill increases financing costs by adding fees to Rural Development loans.
Farmers and rural businesses have been able to make excellent use of #farmbill programs to help lower energy bills and create #renewableenergy. This #GOPfarmbill still cuts funding for the Rural Energy for America Program.
In the face of chaotic #trade policies coming out of the White House, farmers have repeatedly asked for more funding support for the Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program. The #GOPfarmbill ignores them.
This one is so wrong it‚Äôs stunning: the #GOPfarmbill still requires #SNAP recipients to confront former partners to recoup child support, or else they lose benefits. That puts families at risk.
In fact, after what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúmanager‚Äôs amendment‚Äù, the #GOPFarmBill‚Äôs workforce bureaucracy will actually knock an ADDITIONAL 600,000 people off #SNAP, with a total of 1.9 million of our loved ones, friends and neighbors kicked off by 2021.
House Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn‚Äôt kick a single person off #SNAP. That‚Äôs also untrue. 400,000 household will lose benefits AND 265,000 kids will lose access to food security through free or subsidized school meals.
House Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn‚Äôt cut #SNAP. That‚Äôs still untrue. H.R. 2 cuts $14.1 billion in benefits and imposes costly and burdensome state bureaucracies.

In the months before this so-called "Zero Tolerance" family separation policy was announced, some 700 children were separated from their parents.   The number of children acknowledged to have been ripped from their families by the Trump Administration so far:  1,358 and counting.
These are not the actions of a great nation, nor of a people who believe in strength of family. This must end. I am cosponsoring a House Resolution Condemning Separation of Children from their Parents at the Border and demanding we stop this inhumane activity immediately.
In just 2 weeks of their new border policy taking children from parents, the Trump Admin broke up more than 600 families with no plan to reunite them.  Many fled extreme danger in search of legal asylum. Instead, infants as young as 18 months were ripped from their parents' arms.

Forcing taxpayers to bail out uncompetitive generators is not a sustainable path forward, but they will find willing partners in Congress for a sincere plan that drives meaningful improvements in our grid infrastructure and deals with persistent blind spots in our energy markets.
I urge the Trump Administration to drop this charade and come to Congress with proposals that: 1. strengthen cybersecurity for critical infrastructure 2. sustain domestic nuclear supply 3. drive investments in our nation's energy grid to make it smarter, more reliable &amp; resilient
Policymakers have a long history of debating and supporting grid attributes that are not adequately addressed in energy markets. But those decisions should be made by elected officials in Congress or at the State level.
Puerto Rico's blackout during and after Hurricane Maria, like most outages, was NOT caused by a lack of electricity generation. It was a transmission &amp; distribution failure.   After months of weak &amp; inhumane crisis response, that has become a tragic and deadly government failure.
The leaked NSC memo outlining this energy bailout shows the Trump Administration has missed the point entirely, with no lessons learned or even a mention of the most devastating blackout in our nation‚Äôs history: the failure of #PuertoRico's grid during and after Hurricane Maria.
I am concerned that ratepayers are being asked to pay for a proposal cooked up with seemingly no regard for its high cost or its minuscule benefits. For many reasons, our response needs to be much more cost-effective.
A @rhodium_group review found fuel emergencies/deficiencies at power plants resulted in 0.00007% of total customer hours of lost service.   No amount of power generation will fix a downed power line, but this Administration wants consumers pay a lot more for very little benefit.
@SecretaryPerry @ENERGY The Department of Energy‚Äôs second Quadrennial Energy Review showed failures in U.S. electrical distribution systems are responsible for more than 90 percent of all electric power interruptions. https://t.co/fX6QKHjJwF
@SecretaryPerry @ENERGY I've written before about America's need to refocus on grid resilience instead of pushing costly efforts to prop up uncompetitive energy sources: https://t.co/Tbhhn3W99G
@SecretaryPerry @ENERGY In January, federal energy regulators unanimously rejected that "fuel assurance" proposal. I posted a few comments on their decision at the time: https://t.co/nikE4RaQMD
I questioned @SecretaryPerry last October on whether the Department of @Energy had looked at cost when it was cooking up this political favor to uncompetitive coal &amp; other generators.  His answer, in part: "what's the cost of freedom?" I took that as a no. https://t.co/yfW9niRBLs
@ENERGY Let‚Äôs be clear, fuel assurance doesn't guarantee generation after a disaster. During the Polar Vortex, coal piles froze. Coal piles flooded in Hurricane Harvey. This response fails to address the real vulnerabilities in our grid, most notably weaknesses in distribution systems.
As a reminder, in September the @Energy Department launched a rulemaking process under Section 403 of the DoE Organization Act for federal energy regulators to provide cost recovery to coal &amp; nuclear generators based on their ability to store fuel on-site: https://t.co/oiFsjsg2Yp
Much of this was revealed thanks to a leaked 41-page NSC memo showing President Trump‚Äôs Department of Energy planning to go far beyond its statutory authority and to put a political thumb on the scale of electricity markets: https://t.co/1bEgXOrubU
That would be an unprecedented market intervention, and not just unnecessary and legally indefensible but would actually drive up electricity costs for consumers and make American manufacturers less globally competitive.
America is long overdue for an honest national conversation about securing, strengthening &amp; modernizing our electrical grid.   Instead, the Trump Administration wants to turn crisis procedures (e.g. after a natural disaster) into a multi-year bailout for uncompetitive energy.
The Trump Administration has floated a proposal to bail out uncompetitive electricity generators. It‚Äôs a costly, unjustifiable bit of political favoritism that hurts consumers &amp; should never see light of day. Bear with me a few tweets as I dive into the weeds of US energy policy.
According to New York‚Äôs Department of Financial Services, "Without the federal action, the average requested rate increase would be 12.1 percent"  Many fought to stop this from happening &amp; things can still get worse, but they can also get better. Let's get Congress back on track.

@germanrlopez Just 1 in 5 Americans suffering from #addiction today is getting treatment. This massive treatment gap is one of the top reasons America's #OpioidEpidemic persists. We have no shortage of solutions, but for some reason Republican leaders keep blocking them from getting a vote.
Consider this: "unlike the stories commonly told in the news &amp; coroners‚Äô reports, Ricciuti did not overdose and die. Early in 2017, she got on buprenorphine... which does not produce a euphoric high when taken as prescribed." @germanrlopez #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/eeAdf4TMVI
This is stunningly bad. Holding a PFAS summit was almost a step in the right direction. But this team of @EPA political appointees can‚Äôt even get out of their own way without compromising scientific integrity or our First Amendment.
Unfortunately, victims of PFAS contamination are not being represented at this @EPA summit. Few if any independent scientists are being allowed to present their views.   Now we‚Äôre hearing reporters are being kicked out of the event, in some cases forcibly: https://t.co/6ZG3DtcFLR
.@EPA needs to hear from these Americans who have been made sick by exposure to these contaminants and from independent scientists who can guide us toward smart necessary environmental protections to eliminate these dangerous chemicals from our drinking water.
.@EPA is convening a national summit on PFAS, contaminants affecting countless families &amp; communities‚Äîin Hoosick Falls &amp; Newburgh, NY among MANY others.   Sadly, victims &amp; community voices have been largely shut out of the event &amp; have no #SeatAtTheTable. https://t.co/ylep7FN9Vk

@USCBO @NewYorkHunger This #GOPFarmBill is filled with heartless, foolish, anti-family nonsense that creates more bureaucracy and delivers fewer benefits at higher costs. It‚Äôs bad for New York and terrible for America.   I‚Äôm voting ‚ÄúNO‚Äù
@USCBO @NewYorkHunger The #GOPFarmBill even forces parents with children to apply for child support, a process that can require 4-5 days off work to file paperwork and appear in court and could even lose them their #SNAP eligibility under the new work requirements!
@USCBO @NewYorkHunger Under the #GOPFarmBill, New York would also be forced to create a large new bureaucracy tracking some 544,000 #SNAP food assistance recipients each month, shifting even more bureaucratic cost burdens onto our state &amp; local taxpayers.
@USCBO @NewYorkHunger As a result, passing this #FarmBill would mean some 467,000 New York households will lose their eligibility for heating/cooling assistance and more than half will lose #SNAP benefits, a $270 million loss for our state.
@USCBO @NewYorkHunger The #GOPFarmBill would also sever the link between food assistance and heating/cooling support, a link that simplifies paperwork and helps the most vulnerable New Yorkers avoid the dangers of hunger and extreme temperatures.
@USCBO @NewYorkHunger Stripping state flexibility for #SNAP benefits under the #GOPFarmBill will also re-impose a ‚Äúbenefit cliff‚Äù‚ûûresulting in many of our poorest neighbors &amp; families losing food assistance if they earn even a modest pay raise. This makes no sense.
@USCBO @NewYorkHunger The #GOPFarmBill also imposes asset and vehicle tests that will significantly increase the bureaucratic challenges and delays for many folks who may not even know where their next meal is coming from.
@USCBO A MINIMUM of 34,000 New Yorkers would lose #SNAP food assistance under the #GOPFarmBill, a $54 million loss for our state, according to @NewYorkHunger
@USCBO The #GOPFarmBill would be especially painful for New York's poorest individuals &amp; families who depend on #SNAP food assistance just to get by: https://t.co/KmXikF0LNM

As Senators grill @EPAScottPruitt this morning, a friendly reminder of the many abuses &amp; scandals that define his time at @EPA: https://t.co/yEGmzZUP9r
@USCBO ...and it removes some $800 million in conservation funding for agricultural operations, making it harder for farmers use their land and resources in ways that don‚Äôt pollute or do lasting damage to their own land, water, or neighbors.
@USCBO ...and a prohibition on local governments creating stronger protections against pesticide runoff than the low federal standard, taking vital public health decisions out of the hands of local communities.
@USCBO Congressional Republicans also threw in some nasty anti-environment provisions including weakened protections against deforestation, putting some 58.5 million acres up for grabs to the highest bidder: https://t.co/PKgAp8DkdI
@USCBO Shockingly, the #GOPFarmBill would force #SNAP recipients to confront former partners to demand child support or else they lose their benefits.
@USCBO The #GOPFarmBill spends $65 million to push low-quality health insurance plans onto America‚Äôs farmers. These low-standard plans will barely be worth the paper they‚Äôre printed on. Farmers are tough, but they‚Äôre not invulnerable. https://t.co/q5YSfdhukb
@USCBO Under the #GOPFarmBill, food assistance recipients would have to register highly personal private information in a national database, forcing them to choose between their own data security and their family‚Äôs food security: https://t.co/xZHNRfCnPo
If you like big, expensive and slow bureaucracies, you're going to love the #GOPFarmBill, which the non-partisan @USCBO says would spend billions creating vast impractical bureaucracies that will take more than a decade to even get up and running:  https://t.co/MsVabtl9cZ
It also adds new bureaucracy and complexity to high-speed broadband development grants that farm communities have been waiting for. This makes no sense.
The #GOPFarmBill slashes hundreds of millions of dollars from job-creating rural development initiatives and loan guarantees for #smallbiz. That makes life &amp; business harder for farmers and rural communities.
Instead of strengthening trade assistance programs, the #GOPFarmBill simply ignores America‚Äôs small farms that are already reeling from President Trump‚Äôs patchwork trade policies.
@chelliepingree Under the #GOPFarmBill, more than a quarter-million (265,000) of America‚Äôs most vulnerable and food-insecure kids will be left to go hungry at school. https://t.co/ILQUnRNuC8
As my friend &amp; colleague Maine Representative @chelliepingree puts it, "Work requirements will do nothing but snatch away a lifeline from those who don‚Äôt know where their next meal will come from." https://t.co/GLsKiQ115h
These requirements targeting poor families &amp; folks approaching retirement age also ignore the practical realities of working life for millions of Americans, e.g. @CenterOnBudget: "Most Working-Age SNAP Participants Work, But Often in Unstable Jobs" https://t.co/BTTPvKAnYo
These requirements are little more than a Republican talking point, e.g. @GaBudget: ‚ÄúResearch shows work requirements do not help people reach financial security. Instead, it leads to an abrupt loss of benefits and increased financial instability.‚Äù https://t.co/bGTnfEGiDf
#SNAP food assistance already has work requirements. Congressional Republicans are imposing painful changes that target families with children and individuals between 50-59 years of age.  2 million of the most vulnerable Americans will lose food security. https://t.co/k8JXSGhKhl
A majority, nearly 2/3, of all Americans receiving #SNAP food assistance are children, seniors or disabled persons.  And more than half of the remaining 1/3 have kids themselves. https://t.co/AfJbUAxlaU
Here's your headline: #GOPFarmBill cuts $23 billion from #SNAP food assistance.  #SNAP supports 1 in 10 Americans, including millions of children, seniors, people with disabilities, working families and 3 million #veterans.
I'll dive into heartless details, but bottom line: this bill ignores the needs of America‚Äôs farmers &amp; rips needed food assistance out of the hands of millions of America's poorest children &amp; families. https://t.co/jzYIZMrxUv

Last night we found out Pruitt‚Äôs questionable #Morocco trip may have actually cost taxpayers more than $100,000, more than double the price tag previously revealed: https://t.co/NUmgS5WNdb
UPDATE: a lobbyist helped organize @EPAScottPruitt‚Äôs highly unusual #Morocco trip last year and got a job out of it‚Äîworking as a foreign agent for Morocco: https://t.co/nZ8TeFrvH5
@TGowdySC @EPAoig .@EPAoig, an independent investigative office, actually expressed a need for a significant increase to its budget to carry out oversight of the agency. The request was rejected out of hand by the Trump Administration: https://t.co/fBSVXsS9Vg
@TGowdySC @EPAoig Notable that EPA's independent investigator @EPAoig had requested a budget increase for 2019. Instead the Trump Administration has proposed cutting the budget for this independent investigative office by almost $4 million: https://t.co/exDDQVmpqL
@TGowdySC This and more is why I raised serious concerns at our recent EPA budget hearing about whether the agency‚Äôs Inspector General @EPAoig will have the resources needed to investigate Pruitt‚Äôs seemingly endless misconduct: https://t.co/VjzNcZHyxV
Amid all of this, in mid-April, House Oversight &amp; Government Reform chairman @TGowdySC wrote to Scott Pruitt (again) because: ‚Äúthe EPA has failed to produce all the documents requested.‚Äù https://t.co/hvfycTxQV7
@EPAoig On at least one occasion Administrator @EPAScottPruitt reportedly tried to use lights &amp; sirens to get to an appointment on time. The lead agent on his security detail refused since it's an emergency-only measure. Two weeks later that agent was reassigned: https://t.co/HNX72dWgJk
@EPAoig Pruitt‚Äôs taxpayer-funded travel abuses don‚Äôt stop at first-class flights. Last year, he reportedly used taxpayer funds to upgrade his official car &amp; add luxury leather seats &amp; bullet-resistant covers: https://t.co/rQ6NCO84iq
EPA‚Äôs independent investigator @EPAoig has confirmed that it is investigating the Administrator‚Äôs use of an official security detail for his personal trips (Disneyland, Rose Bowl, college basketball games): https://t.co/4lRZSRc79S
Pruitt‚Äôs lavish taxpayer-funded security detail reportedly also traveled with him on non-official business, including trips home to Tulsa, a family vacation to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl: https://t.co/KOX5Na24N4
Administrator Pruitt‚Äôs aides even considered leasing a private jet for him at a cost to taxpayers of some $100,000/month: https://t.co/gIxo7TO04P.
Around that same time it came out that taxpayers had also paid more than $105,000 for Pruitt‚Äôs unusually large security detail to fly first-class: https://t.co/IOuZvEXyPg
A few weeks later it was reported that Pruitt had spent some $68,000 in taxpayer funds, just on first-class flights and luxury hotel upgrades for himself, just in the six months prior: https://t.co/CFiF4aaoGu
NOTE: when taxpayers weren‚Äôt paying for his tickets, he flew coach: https://t.co/MlGlXB16Mx
Pruitt announced on March 1st that he would discontinue the practice of flying first-class, after more than a year on the job: https://t.co/0ObnCavBzF
Pruitt also scrapped his plan for a taxpayer-funded trip to Australia, but not before spending $45,000 of your money to fly a team of five to prepare for his arrival: https://t.co/UEyVCftNz6
@EPAoig @TGowdySC Amid all of this scrutiny, the Administrator canceled a taxpayer-funded trip to Israel, showing the first hint that he knew his lavish taxpayer-funded spending on travel had crossed a line: https://t.co/xhmYiDVaM8
@EPAoig The Republican chair of the House Oversight &amp; Government Reform committee @TGowdySC also sent a letter to Pruitt requesting information about his unusual taxpayer-funded travel arrangements: https://t.co/85WjjSsjQc
@EPAoig We also sent a follow-up letter to Administrator Pruitt reminding him of outstanding Congressional requests tied to his first-class travel and any related ethics waivers that might have enabled it: https://t.co/WhZ0XlyDKn
@EPAoig We reached out once again to the EPA‚Äôs independent investigator @EPAoig to verify that they were reviewing Pruitt‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúblanket waiver‚Äù for what seemed to be unlimited first-class flights at taxpayer expense: https://t.co/0zGlRR6O6P
@EPAoig Again, for a brief accounting of just some of these taxpayer-funded flights, check out this previous #thread: https://t.co/ILQVErzS6P
@EPAoig This included the infamous ‚Äúblanket waiver‚Äù EPA said Pruitt had been granted but which Pruitt himself continues to deny: https://t.co/hidF26lAqK
@EPAoig Things got worse for Pruitt in February when reporters started to uncover his litany of expensive taxpayer-funded first-class flights and upscale hotel stays: https://t.co/meUKkkI5wf
Given this curious activity, @EPAoig again expanded their investigation into Pruitt‚Äôs possible misuse of taxpayer-funded travel: https://t.co/iKCcjFNI6m. Keep in mind that his sweetheart housing deal with an energy lobbyist with LNG clients was only revealed months later
And this Morocco trip, where Administrator Pruitt did little official work and veered well outside the scope of his job or the agency he leads? This one trip cost American taxpayers nearly $40,000: https://t.co/pVs1LhR1xw.
EPA‚Äôs release of the Administrator's unredacted calendar for his Morocco trip showed little official work, having only disclosed a single one-hour meeting each day for two of his three travel days there: https://t.co/5hFm3EUjSh
@EPAoig @EPAScottPruitt In December 2017, @EPAgov published a press release announcing that Administrator Pruitt had traveled to Morocco to promote liquefied natural gas (LNG), an issue outside the scope of EPA‚Äôs mission or the Administrator‚Äôs duties: https://t.co/n1qYXvvq65 https://t.co/YuXi4mBEy4
@EPAoig @EPAScottPruitt Within days, @EPAoig confirmed that it was expanding its investigation into EPA Administrator Pruitt‚Äôs reported abuses of taxpayer-funded travel: https://t.co/DmLdV6zeP7
@EPAoig @EPAScottPruitt My colleagues and I requested that @EPAoig expand their investigation at that time to include private and military plane chartering at taxpayer expense: https://t.co/jxLkobkhY8
@EPAoig In late September 2017, it came out that @EPAScottPruitt had been using private planes and had even used a military jet, at a significant cost to taxpayers, to fulfill his government duties: https://t.co/2mkZirp1w7
EPA‚Äôs independent investigator @EPAoig accepted the request and started looking into Administrator Pruitt's questionable travel: https://t.co/3s70EpYJDF
@EPAScottPruitt Even "though a trip to Oklahoma might last three or five days, it was not unusual for only one such [informational] meeting to be listed during Pruitt's time away from Washington." When we learned of these large travel gaps, we requested an investigation: https://t.co/8pixyC3O75
In a span of 3 months last year, @EPAScottPruitt was in Oklahoma for nearly half of his time "on the job." His trips home cost some $15,000, mostly at taxpayer expense. EPA reports show major gaps in the Administrator's official schedule over that period: https://t.co/6shNDA1Sga
When he testified before Congress last week, @EPAScottPruitt said he wasn‚Äôt planning to try to undermine state clean vehicle standards.  Less than 24 hours later, we found out that might not be true. We need some answers. https://t.co/Lu22V6taro
Now let's get to taxpayer-funded travel, part II of Administrator Scott Pruitt's endless list of abuses, misconduct &amp; mismanagement at @EPAgov.  For a partial rundown of his expensive flights that you paid for, start here: https://t.co/ILQVErzS6P

@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight NOTE: Pruitt &amp; staff took a $40,000 trip to Morocco in December to push Liquefied Natural Gas exports (not in EPA's purview).

@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight Lobbying disclosures recently revealed that Scott Pruitt himself met with that same lobbyist and another client in 2017:  https://t.co/pAkbu3SWBF
@EPAoig @TGowdySC @GOPoversight Mr. Pruitt told Fox News in clear terms that the lobbyist tied to his far-below-market-rate condo rental "has no clients who have business before this agency": https://t.co/MzXOvFjOaw
@EPAoig A few days later @TGowdySC, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee @GOPoversight, informed the EPA Administrator that his committee had also opened an investigation: https://t.co/hvfycTxQV7
At this point my colleagues and I sent a letter to the EPA Inspector General @EPAoig requesting a review of this unusual arrangement: https://t.co/qvromXyufI
@EPAGov That ethics review included a copy of Pruitt's lease showing that the original landlord's name on the EPA Administrator's sweetheart condo lease was not the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before EPA, it was the lobbyist himself: https://t.co/Et7Vwb7zpj https://t.co/nzO1pJb8gh
@EPAGov After Pruitt claimed that an EPA ethics official had reviewed the lease, that same official clarified that he wasn't given all the facts about the rental before he had to issue his decision: https://t.co/mhyH3CdXLD
The energy lobbyist tied to Pruitt's sweetheart apartment rental claimed at the time that he had not lobbied @EPAgov in 2017 or 2018: https://t.co/EMWfsfxOvf  (spoiler alert: he had)
President Trump was asked about Mr. Pruitt's housing scandal the next day (4/3). The President responded, "I hope he's going to be great." https://t.co/EMWfsfxOvf
@WhiteHouse My colleagues and I sent a letter to Mr. Pruitt formally expressing our concerns over possible conflict of interest under this special rental agreement: https://t.co/s1BjUs2xPk
The @WhiteHouse launched an inquiry into Pruitt's unusual housing arrangement with ties to a prominent energy lobbyist that same day.  That was almost a month ago: https://t.co/XWWRFWnetO
On April 2nd, we found out one of those clients had their pipeline project approved by @EPAgov at the time the Administrator was living there: https://t.co/qMeYTl55Ar
@EPAScottPruitt On March 29, we learned Scott Pruitt had a sweetheart (heavily discounted) apartment rental deal with the wife of a top energy lobbyist with clients interested in @EPAgov decisions: https://t.co/2U87yeQCaT

The students participating in today's #NationalSchoolWalkout deserve to be heard. Peaceful civil disobedience is not easy &amp; often comes with consequences. They have weighed their options and are following their conscience. I am proud to join them. #NotOneMore #NeverAgainMSD
Instead of trying to repeal the #ACA &amp; block grant #Medicaid, two pillars of U.S. #addiction treatment, Congress should actually work to combat the deadly &amp; worsening #OpioidEpidemic.   Here are some potentially life-saving bills we could easily advance to a vote: https://t.co/qWX3oTMJNk
"#HR3692 would build on progress made under #CARA, adding additional nursing specialists to those able to prescribe medication-assisted treatment (MAT) &amp; codifying a cap increase for the number of MAT patients doctors can treat at any given time."  More at https://t.co/p9t3uDWBwg
A heartbreaking &amp; preventable tragedy. End these deadly barriers to #addiction treatment including doctor patient caps &amp; long waiting lists. Congress must pass #HR3692: Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act and any other bill that gets this done today. Lives will be saved. https://t.co/0oIdeNfLb4

Our nation‚Äôs top law enforcement officers shouldn‚Äôt be targeted, threatened with removal or fired simply for doing their jobs. I find it disheartening and deeply troubling that this needs to be said.
America is a nation of laws. No one is above them or immune from accountability to them. That simple fact has protected our democracy for more than two centuries. I‚Äôm cosponsoring the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (HR 5476) to safeguard this important standard.
Dear @SpeakerRyan: "Our families deserve to know what chemicals are being sprayed on their food, released into their water or added into products they buy.

Two wrongs don't make a right. Republican leaders shouldn't have spent $1.5 trillion to give huge tax breaks to the richest families &amp; corporations in America.

According to 56 retired generals &amp; admirals, ‚Äúthis proposed ban, if implemented, would cause significant disruptions, deprive the military of mission-critical talent &amp;  compromise the integrity of transgender troops.‚Äù #ProtectTransTroops #TransMilitaryBan https://t.co/wG2nfPzbp5
Transgender service members have served this nation openly with distinction for most of the last 2 years. President Trump is playing politics and wasting taxpayer dollars &amp; military resources to target a group of America‚Äôs bravest &amp; most selfless.
President Trump is using the Friday news dump to try to sneak through the same transgender troop ban that fell apart on him six month ago.

@BarackObama @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump #ACA‚Äôs Medicaid expansion has brought quality health care to millions more working Americans. Republicans have tried for years to strip it away. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/To5uuYtJl3
@BarackObama @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump The #ACA also makes insurance meaningful by guaranteeing that ALL insurance plans cover essential health benefits such as #addiction treatment, mental health support &amp; maternity care. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/xuFpwqO0s2
@BarackObama @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Despite all those efforts by Republican leaders to #sabotage America's healthcare system, the #ACA still provides key preventive health services‚Äîsuch as flu shots, cancer screenings, and birth control‚Äîat no cost to Americans with insurance. #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks https://t.co/eZ3XqObWX9
@BarackObama @HouseGOP FACT: 3 million fewer Americans had health insurance coverage after @realdonaldtrump's first year in office. The #GOPTaxScam even included a measure to #sabotage the ACA ‚Äì and it's driving premiums higher for American families. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/JGiMzHSWJX

@NTIAgov I also co-chair the Heritage Area Caucus and am pleased that we were able to secure $500,000 increase for Heritage Partnership Programs. Thanks to innovative public-private partnerships, each dollar we spend attracts an average of $5.50 in additional private funding.
@NTIAgov Historic sites &amp; cultural centers instill in us a sense of place. They can also be important economic drivers: America‚Äôs museums spend $21 billion in their communities every year &amp; employ 400,000 Americans. We secured $3 million under this deal for the Office of Museum Services.
Broadband Internet has gone from a luxury to an economic necessity. Our Capital Region still has homes &amp; businesses without this access. We worked to secure an additional $2.1 billion to expand rural broadband access and $7.5 million for @NTIAgov to improve its broadband maps.
The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) helps low-income Americans improve the energy-efficiency of their homes. Democrats fought to secure $248 million for the #weatherization program, another one the President attempted to eliminate.
That's in addition to securing $47 million more for the Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), a major source of cutting-edge U.S. energy research.
America‚Äôs competitors around the world are spending heavily on clean energy, and we are barely keeping up. Disregarding the President‚Äôs requested cuts, we were able to add $231 million to the Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
@EPA @CDCgov Foreign interference in the 2016 election is well-documented, despite many denials by President Trump. Thankfully the President‚Äôs opinions had little to do with the outcome here, which yielded $380 million in new funding to help states protect election systems from cyber threats.
@EPA This budget deal loosens the gag on @CDCgov #gunviolence research, opening a door that has been closed for more than two decades. The bill also strengthens the background check system and helps cash-strapped school systems looking to invest in greater #schoolsafety &amp; security.
Thanks to Democrats, President Trump got none of his desired cuts to @EPA. Staff members at this agency work tirelessly every day to ensure pollution and contaminants can be kept out of the water we drink, the air we breathe and the soil that helps grow the food on our tables.
86% of U.S. households depend on public water systems, many of which need major repairs or replacement. My colleagues and I secured $300 million in additional funding for states to repair drinking water systems &amp; $300 million more to support state-run clean water programs.
We also secured $1.6b for Community Health Centers on the front lines of the #OpioidCrisis. And despite the President's proposal to cut them, Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment grants will continue to deliver lifesaving treatment to some 1.5 million individuals every year.
As America‚Äôs #opioidcrisis continues to worsen, the need for a national response becomes ever more urgent. I am proud to report that my Democratic colleagues and I were able to secure $3.2 billion for programs that specifically address the #OpioidEpidemic.
This bipartisan budget agreement include dozens and dozens of critical wins in other vitally important areas that will help millions of Americans. Many were opposed by President Trump and Republican leaders. They are included largely because I and other Democrats fought for them.
We still have a tremendous amount of work to do on these and other related issues, including securing universal background checks on all firearm sales and protections for undocumented individuals who were brought to America as children and now face deportation by this President.
Overall, the other priorities represented in this bill will help millions of Americans who are still being largely ignored and forgotten by this President and Republican leaders in Congress.
...this bill avoids foolish, costly and unpopular spending on a border wall and other misguided priorities that would do little to address the major issues with our border or our immigration system.
While I remain deeply concerned by blockbuster military spending increases and broader budgetary issues less than a year after Republicans voted to add some $2 trillion to the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthy...
...and critical funding for proven safety net programs such as Head Start, home #weatherization, community #health centers, #manufacturing growth, heritage areas, #museums and #libraries, and much more.
...support for states to make urgent drinking water repairs and upgrades, mental health treatment and training, advances in clean energy research, improvements to our broadband Internet maps and America‚Äôs transportation systems...
Today‚Äôs bipartisan budget agreement reflects major priorities that my Democratic colleagues and I have been actively pushing for months to achieve, including major steps forward in combating the #OpioidEpidemic, addressing gun violence research...
After repeated delays and years of painful cuts, Republican leaders in Washington seem to have finally realized that their partisan crisis-driven governing does not serve the needs or best interests of the American people.  #omnibus #budget

@EPA Dr, Gretchen Goldman, a trained #scientist &amp; research director at @UCSUSA, points out that attempts to limit @EPA's use of these kinds of scientific data reflect, at best, a failure to understand #science &amp; the agency's rule-making process: https://t.co/VAYaAcUuhW
@EPA It would almost certainly drive our public health costs higher as weaker protections lead to more pollution, more missed days at work &amp; school, higher rates of asthma, heart disease, other disorders that show up first in the scientific data this political appointee wants to block
@EPA That would mean weaker protections for the air we breathe, the rivers, streams and other water systems that flow into our taps, and the soil that makes it possible for our food to grow.
@EPA Prohibiting @EPA staff from using the best available scientific data to set rules &amp; protections poses a direct threat to the agency's abliity to safeguard our public health and the environment.
The Trump-appointed @EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is preparing to aggressively cut back the agency's use of #science in its rule-making: https://t.co/EvALKRpX2H

May her extraordinary legacy continue to guide us, and may her family find peace in in the knowledge that her spirit lives on in all who were lucky enough to know her well.   Rest in peace, my friend.
Working with Louise taught me a great deal about how to be a better public servant and I will forever miss our countless conversations and her warm and wise counsel.
Louise touched the lives of many with the warmth of her smile and sweet sound of her Kentucky accent. Her determination to fight for the people of New York &amp; our nation will long be a shining example for aspiring young women and all Americans of good conscience &amp; selfless heart.
When she spoke it was with conviction, charm, intellect, integrity, and a force that felt at times like it would raise the Capitol dome.
Louise was beloved by many for her lifetime of service to the people of Rochester. Her fierce and principled leadership as the dean of our New York delegation and as the first woman ever to chair the House Rules Committee elevated our work in Congress every single day.
History will remember Louise Slaughter as one of the most respected and dedicated members ever to walk the halls of Congress. I will remember her as a dear and loyal friend. As she would say, I will miss her like a front tooth. https://t.co/8ColMsfZ9L

Amidst this lavish spending on travel and office upgrades for the agency's Administrator Scott Pruitt, EPA is facing massive cuts to career staff and programs that are critical to helping state and local governments safeguard public health and the environment.
He spent $10,830 in taxpayer funds to fly through Colorado, Iowa, North Dakota and Texas.   He flew to Colorado Springs in May to speak to a Heritage Foundation meeting at a cost to taxpayers of $2,903.56  A week later he flew to Tulsa for the weekend, costing taxpayers $1,980,34
Just in the month of June last year, Administrator Pruitt spent at least $90,000 on taxpayer-funded travel.  In July he spent $4,443 of your money on trips to Birmingham and Atlanta.   He spent $4,680 to fly to Salt Lake City, Minneapolis &amp; Little Rock to trash water protections
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA Let's not forget: this is the same EPA Administrator who took a military flight from Andrews to Covington, Ohio and then to New York at a cost to taxpayers of $36,068.50  And who chartered a flight between two Oklahoma airports at a cost to taxpayers of $14,434
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA Not only does EPA already have a secure booth, this all comes on top of other troubling taxpayer-funded office expenses by Administrator Pruitt, including:  $2,500 to install biometric locks with fingerprint readers in his office  $3,000 to sweep his office for listening devices
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA In addition to Pruitt's costly &amp; customized sound-proof booth, taxpayers also paid:  $7,978 to remove closed-circuit TV equipment plus $3,350 to patch and paint that area of the Administrator's office  $3,470 to pour a 55 sq ft concrete floor and $3,361 to install a drop ceiling
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA EPA previously disclosed the cost of this customized "privacy booth for the administrator": $24,570  Now it's coming out that this disclosure was hiding nearly $18,000 in additional taxpayer-funded expenses.
.@EPAScottPruitt spent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to install what is basically a bunker in his @EPA office where he can have secret conversations. Despite repeated Congressional inquiries, he still refuses to disclose what he's using it for or why he needs it. https://t.co/oFWJC6ARdF

That lasted a few hours until lobbyists from the gun industry and a group of Congressional Republicans got to him: https://t.co/HSzmVoedml
As he has done many times and on many issues in the past, President Trump made big promises to act on this issue. Specifically, he promised strong background checks and age restrictions that could save lives: https://t.co/gsSXw19AOS
The gun industry's profiteering from these national tragedies has gotten so bad, the stock market value of its companies goes up nearly every time news breaks of another deadly mass shooting: https://t.co/DxWbuN3OY7
America's #gunviolence epidemic is not a coincidence. In fact, the U.S. gun industry has managed to turn nearly every crisis of violence into a lucrative opportunity to sell more guns: https://t.co/SKEQwwqrLX
An @Everytown for Gun Safety analysis of mass shootings from 2009-2016 found that in 85 of 156 such events (54%), the shooter killed a current or former intimate partner or other family member before or during their shooting spree: https://t.co/e2GCfEEZNN

7,000 pairs of shoes rest peacefully in the grass outside the U.S. Capitol today.  Each pair represents a child lost to gun violence since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary that took the lives of 20 young children and six adults in 2012.  I am heartbroken. #notonemore https://t.co/OGNazF7uQ6
@CDCgov The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 people and injured 851 on October 1, 2017 using a so-called "bump stock" modification to increase his rate of fire.   Nearly six months and several deadly tragedies later, we're still far from having a real enforceable ban: https://t.co/ELga0NilGV
@CDCgov High-capacity magazines make it possible for shooters to keep firing for much longer before having to reload. It's heartbreaking but important to consider that limiting magazine sizes could save lives: https://t.co/3GvYNfIxJy
@CDCgov Let's start with universal background checks. If we want to manage the flood of guns and keep them out of the hands of criminals and people with violent tendencies, we need universal background checks including for private gun sales: https://t.co/CGNZFoT9jD
@CDCgov The American people also overwhelmingly support stronger gun laws and believe they would effectively prevent more mass shootings: https://t.co/n9uZso9LwJ
@CDCgov Despite gun industry claims, the available #facts &amp; #science show gun laws do work &amp; do effectively save lives and reduce gun violence: https://t.co/Xj8w1wkGSp

Bottom line: H.R. 3387 is a smart, long-overdue bipartisan bill that has already passed out of committee and is ready for a final vote on the House floor.  Every life &amp; every job depends on access to safe, clean drinking water. Let's get this done.
7. Provide additional support to disadvantaged communities by increasing the maximum and minimum amounts of DWSRF assistance for these communities.  8. Encourage the use of asset management by drinking water systems.
5. Require water systems serving 3,300+ persons to monitor for unregulated contaminants, such as PFOA (current minimum = 10,000)  6. Extend the time for DWSRF loans to be repaid in full from 20 years to 30 after a project‚Äôs completion, and up to 40 for disadvantaged communities.
3. Provide $750m over 5 yrs, to support State water offices through the Public Water System Supervision grant program.  4. Require water system risk assessments reviewing resilience of systems from malevolent acts &amp; natural hazards, such as extreme weather events.
Among other things, this bill would: 1. Require ‚ÄúBuy America‚Äù &amp; prevailing wage standards to ensure American workers are benefiting from our investments.  2. Establish $5m/yr grant program to help schools &amp; daycare centers with drinking water fountains that have lead components.
H.R. 3387 reflects the tough bipartisan work &amp; best ideas from Republicans and Democrats that have come together to address our drinking water needs, a great and growing national #infrastructure challenge.
My friend @RepShimkus &amp; I also worked together to craft H.R. 3387, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017, a major bipartisan bill that was passed out of our Environment Subcommittee, the broader Energy &amp; Commerce Committee &amp; now awaits a vote by the full House.
For the past three Congresses, I have introduced the AQUA Act (H.R. 1071) to provide significant support through DWSRF to state and local governments that are working to maintain, upgrade and replace their existing local drinking water systems: https://t.co/vPv9tnzMRX
We can deal with this, and we can do it now. Congress needs to reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), the primary source of federal funding for drinking water infrastructure financing.  We haven't done this in 21 years.
The news isn't all bad. Businesses are more likely to consider areas with modern water systems over places where water safety, reliability, or affordability is a concern. And according to @BGAlliance, $1 billion invested in water infrastructure creates more than 20,000 jobs.
Tragedies in Flint, Hoosick Falls and beyond show real dangers to public health. There may be as many as 10 million lead service lines currently in use across the U.S. Many of our schools have drinking fountains with lead components.   Those numbers should be zero.
Every time "boil water advisory" or "water main break" shows up in your local news, that's your drinking water system breaking.   Across the U.S. there are more than 700 water main breaks every day.
Outdated drinking water systems aren't just more expensive to maintain &amp; likely to fail. Leaking pipes lose an estimated 7 billion gallons of clean drinking water every day. That's treated drinkable water, our tax dollars &amp; utility payments, racing down the drain.
@EPA These are major systems. Albany, New York alone has 317 miles of pipes, some dating back to the Rutherford B. Hayes administration (135+ years old).
This is America's reality. 86% of U.S. households rely on public water. In 2013, the @EPA estimated $384.2 billion would be needed in the next 20 years just to keep these systems in working order. https://t.co/Bl1yYjEHlj

This budget sells out our public health, our environment &amp; our nation‚Äôs economy. I simply refuse to support a Trump budget that puts special interests ahead of the needs of the American people.
These proposed heavy-handed cuts to @EPA‚Äôs budget stand in stark contrast to the common-sense protections the agency provides. They pose a threat to public health, our environment, and the long-term strength of our U.S. economy.
The protections we enjoy through the @EPA drive down rates of asthma, heart disease and other health conditions, keeping our workers, businesses and industries more competitive and resulting in fewer missed days of school or work.
@EPA A strong @EPA is our best defense against irresponsible corporate polluters that threaten the water we drink, the air we breathe and the health and safety of our families.
The Trump budget slashes @EPA by a third. Nearly 40% of EPA funds go directly to states, so these cuts would be especially devastating to New York, which now uses those funds for brownfield industrial site cleanup, air pollution monitoring &amp; financing for water infrastructure. https://t.co/5hOMdsSZGA

Another estimate puts the trickle-down effect of the $1.5 trillion #TrumpTaxScam around 13%. Seems optimistic based on the early numbers. Same estimate says 43% goes straight to investors. That also seems conservative: https://t.co/sfGXke1EEE
Corporations expecting a windfall from the #TrumpTaxScam have already spent $97.2 billion on stock buybacks, nearly 40x what they have given to workers in one-time bonuses: https://t.co/GAMKZ49vaN
As a reminder, #Medicaid covers:  - 64% of nursing home residents  - 1.75 million U.S. veterans - 39% of U.S. kids - 1/2 of all U.S. births  #FamilyValues
For the record, Democrats have proposed an alternative infrastructure plan that actually rises to meet the challenge, immediately creates jobs, makes our economy more competitive and keeps our critical infrastructure the public good that it is today: https://t.co/wzb3TlOznv
The President's #infrastructure proposal is almost as a bad as his budget. It does not bet on America, instead bowing out to Wall Street to fix our crumbling drinking water systems, roads, bridges, airports, railways and shipping ports.
A budget is a reflection of its author‚Äôs values, and this one shows President Trump‚Äôs true colors.
The President's budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid &amp; the Affordable Care Act, guts critical environmental protections &amp; eliminates major economic competitiveness support. These extreme cuts would fall disproportionately on programs that support the most vulnerable Americans.
After blowing $1.5 trillion on a tax gift for the wealthy instead of focusing on the middle class, President Trump is now proposing we take a butcher knife to America‚Äôs social safety net. https://t.co/wVw5O0EAUD
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you need to accept responsibility in this. You had a senior aide, in fact the person handling your most sensitive papers, who couldn't qualify for a security clearance. Did you ever think to ask him or the @FBI about it?

The Senate GOP has known for more than a year that they would need a bipartisan compromise to keep the Trump government open. How did they spend their time? - Multiple votes to rip healthcare from 20+ million Americans - $2 trillion tax scam giving most benefits to the wealthiest
GOP leaders control House, Senate &amp; White House. They shouldn't need my vote but if they want it, I've been clear about my priorities: #OpioidEpidemic, Community Health &amp; DSH hospitals, pension security, disaster recovery, funding for veterans health &amp; protection for #DREAMers.
It would be a lot easier to reach a budget deal with border security &amp; protections for #DREAMers if we hadn't just blown $2 trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy.  For reference, that's $12,500 in new debt for every single member of the current U.S. workforce (incl. unemployed) https://t.co/mEuHU6Xehn

Mishandling our energy priorities puts jobs &amp; our economy, public health &amp; the future of our environment at risk, and ensures our competitors will dominate the global clean energy economy for years to come. @realDonaldTrump needs to realize his error here before it‚Äôs too late.
Every other country in the world recognizes that energy innovation is key to dealing with climate change and building a modern competitive economy.
EERE promotes energy innovation and efficiency improvements for low-income families‚Äô homes. Cutting these programs will result in tremendous lost economic opportunity to create, protect, and grow jobs in industries that are not only our future, but our present.
President Trump has proposed cutting the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) by 72%, even more than the President‚Äôs first proposed budget: https://t.co/G5ckXCMCq0

Republicans spent all last year giving themselves tax breaks &amp; sabotaging the U.S. healthcare system. Now they‚Äôre playing politics with children‚Äôs health (#CHIP), threatening to deport #Dreamers who came here as kids, and still doing nothing on the #OpioidEpidemic. #TrumpShutdown
The priorities Americans want to see addressed, #pensions, #Dreamers #healthcare for kids (#CHIP), combatting the #OpioidEpidemic, etc. aren‚Äôt controversial. Why did Republicans in Congress &amp; the White House choose a #TrumpShutdown over meaningful bipartisan progress?
Here‚Äôs what comes from a #TrumpShutdown: -Threatens public health &amp; consumer safety -Disrupts our economy &amp; job creation -Blocks services &amp; investments critical to our families &amp; our communities - Undermines faith in the strength &amp; resilience of our democratic republic
Disappointed to miss our Albany Women‚Äôs March today because of the #TrumpShutdown, but I found some friends to cheer with here in DC.

.@realDonaldTrump's prized achievement in year one?   The #GOPTaxScam, a bad deal for the middle-class making it harder for women &amp; families to put food on the table, buy a home, go to college, and get health insurance. #AYearofTrump
In his first year, the President worked to pass #Trumpcare &amp; made other attempts to #sabotage the #ACA &amp; take away health care from Americans. After #AYearofTrump, 3.2 million fewer Americans have health insurance!
#CHIP funding expired more than 100 days ago, putting 8.9 million children at risk of losing healthcare ‚Äì all because @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans wanted to use them as a bargaining chip. #AYearofTrump
The Trump Administration has made the #LicensetoDiscriminate a major priority -- issuing a new rule that allows virtually anyone, including bosses, health plans, &amp; schools, to discriminate against women by refusing to cover #birthcontrol #AYearOfTrump
6. If not for the "master dealmaker" creating a mess of confusion, repeatedly waffling his position on issues, contradicting himself, his spokespeople and Republican leaders, Congress would have a bipartisan deal done &amp; #shutdown averted.
5. Temporary funding measures (CRs) hurt our military. Defense Sec James Mattis: ‚ÄúNo enemy... has done more to harm readiness of US military than... Budget Control Act defense spending cuts worsened by operating 9 of the last 10 years under CRs wasting copious...taxpayer dollars‚Äù
4, Shutdowns cause major disruptions. In 2013 we halted inspections of food, hazardous waste, drinking water &amp; chemical facilities. 400 parks closed &amp; millions of visitors were turned away. In 1996, 10,000+ Medicare applicants were turned away every day the gov't stayed closed.
3. Government shutdowns have major costs. The 2013 Republican shutdown caused $24 billion in lost economic output. The IRS stopped processing tax refunds or verifying information for banks, delaying millions of Americans who were seeking mortgages and other loans.
Things to remember as we approach a #TrumpShutdown:  1. The President rejected a bipartisan deal last week because it allowed too many immigrants from "sh*thole countries" 2. Clean bills to permanently extend children's health (#CHIP) &amp; protection for #Dreamers would pass easily
Republicans spent 2017 negotiating big tax breaks for themselves &amp; their wealthiest donors instead of dealing with urgent funding querstions. They have held power in the House for the better part of a decade.   This is no way to govern. https://t.co/diVS6rYDFy

I've said it a few times: President Trump is doing nothing  NOTHING  to combat the spreading #OpioidEpidemic that took more that 64,000 lives in 2016.   But this is actually worse: https://t.co/LfJhEBJWM2 https://t.co/V58B8sGYfL
It‚Äôs a new day! Excited to find out if President Trump today will agree with President Trump two weeks ago &amp; help us #ProtectDreamers, or just keep trying to deport them because they‚Äôre not Norwegian enough.  Feeling: nostalgic for American leadership.

What he said was crude. What he meant was offensive and un-American. We are not a nation that casts aside thriving, inspiring, hard-working Americans because of where they came from. Our history is filled with people who came here, with nothing, to share in the American dream.
That was the meeting where President Trump revealed his honest views about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and the entire continent of Africa:  "Why do we want all these people from 'sh*thole countries' coming here?‚Äù https://t.co/QTG7k9O4KV
One more thing: last week Republicans &amp; Democrats in the Senate appeared to have found common ground on a deal to #ProtectDreamers &amp; prevent a #shutdown. Immigration extremists on the White House staff reportedly heard about the deal &amp; raced to destroy it. https://t.co/VEnPArY9vn
These are policies that stand for America‚Äôs family values &amp; moral leaders. They strengthen our middle class economy. As the clock continues to tick down, they are only becoming more urgent.
Millions of Americans are facing painful cuts to #pensions they earned from a lifetime of work. Their retirement security was lost by no fault of their own. Many now face a future of financial dependence on family or the government. These folks deserve better &amp; need our help.
@politico More than 100 days ago, hurricanes slammed into #PuertoRico, #USVI, #Texas &amp; #Florida, knocking out power, destroying infrastructure and devastating communities. We have a responsibility to help our fellow Americans when tragedy strikes. That duty remains unfulfilled for many.
From @Politico: "Trump declared an opioids emergency. Then nothing changed." https://t.co/y9gd067W7f
The #OpioidEpidemic took more than 64,000 lives in 2016, more than Iraq &amp; Vietnam Wars combined, more than firearm &amp; automotive deaths combined, more than at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis. This President has blustered heavily on this issue but nothing done. That has to change
97% of current #DACA recipients are in school or working or both. 91% have a job. None of them have a serious criminal record. Spending the money to deport them is not just wasteful, unethical &amp; foolish, it hurts our economy and dims America's light as a great &amp; leading nation!
@USCBO Rescinding #DACA with no plan to replace it was inhumane and threatens some 800,000 #dreamers who came here as minors &amp; grew up as Americans. Today they are doctors, nurses, teachers, and 900+ have signed up to serve in our military. They deserve protection &amp; a clean #DreamAct.
100+ days ago funding expired for the Children's Health Insurance program (#CHIP). If we renew for 10 years, the non-partisan @USCBO says we save $6 billion and more every year after. Let's make it permanent, save the money &amp; stop playing politics with our kids' health.
Republicans shouldn't need my vote. But if they want it, I have been consistent and clear about my values and the priorities I know will impact the people of my district.
I also remember the government shutting down in 1996. During that one, Social Security &amp; Medicare stopped issuing cards and verifying benefits. As a result, more than 10,000 Medicare applicants were temporarily turned away every single day the government remained closed.
Hang on, there's more. National Institutes of Health stopped admitting new patients or processing grant applications for public health research. IRS stopped processing tax refunds or verifying info for banks, delaying more than a million requests tied to mortgages &amp; other loans.
The 2013 Republican Shutdown did more than $24 billion in economic damage. Environmental inspections of hazardous waste, drinking water &amp; chemical facility sites were halted. FDA delayed nearly 900 food inspections. 400 national parks closed with millions of visitors turned away.
A federal shutdown this Friday would represent a stunning failure by the GOP to govern or lead. It could cause billions in avoidable economic losses &amp; disruptions for millions of Americans.   Republicans shut everything down in 2013 and it did real damage: https://t.co/JZtVL55Xqs
Republicans control the House of Representatives, Senate and White House. They have all the power &amp; votes they need to prevent a gov't shutdown, which they proved when they borrowed $1.8 trillion to give a #taxscam gift to their donors, billionaires &amp; wealthy corporations.

@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM @NewYorkISO @nationalgridus Americans need &amp; deserve a reliable, resilient, modernized and affordable electricity system. We can thank our regulators, grid operators and utilities for all the work they have done thus far, and hope they continue to take a thoughtful approach on the future of our grid.  /end
@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM @NewYorkISO @nationalgridus No doubt our electricity system is changing and will continue to do so. In my view, it is trending in favor of consumers and the environment, as well as toward greater grid reliability.
@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM @NewYorkISO @nationalgridus Increasing grid resilience in the short-term also has important implications for long-term planning to reduce carbon emissions and help temper the worst effects of #climatechange.   This should guide us as we work to develop a smarter grid and cleaner energy mix.
@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM We certainly owe a big #ThankYou to our grid operators (@NewYorkISO), utilities (@nationalgridus and GIPA), and all the linemen and crews who have braved the hostile chill to keep the lights, heat and power on.
@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM The recent extreme winter conditions have reminded us that a diverse mix of generation is important for reliability and resilience.   But we should not fall into the trap of assuming that equates with fuel assurance.
@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM This must include supporting the deployment of distributed energy resources, including storage and microgrids. These resources will improve grid reliability and resilience. We must also encourage hardening of traditional transmission &amp; distribution (T&amp;D) infrastructure.
@SecretaryPerry @theNASEM As we move past the #NOPR, we should concentrate on the real issues that will promote a stronger grid, including the need to make MAJOR research &amp; development (R&amp;D) and #infrastructure investments in order to build the grid (and the generation mix) of the future.
@SecretaryPerry Consider, for example, the National Academies @theNASEM U.S. electricity system resilience report recommendations: https://t.co/afuPhHOXZT https://t.co/wMM1IhONt2
@SecretaryPerry We should certainly be exploring these questions as we invest in rebuilding #PuertoRico‚Äôs grid and continue debating #infrastructure and budget priorities in Congress.
Future disruptions from cyber or physical attacks &amp; extreme weather may be inevitable.  I disagree with @SecretaryPerry's proposal but grid resilience needs attention from regulators &amp; policymakers. Our grid operators should be equipped to review &amp; strengthen systems as needed.
Consider, for example, that coal cannot generate electricity when waterlogged from flooding, and is just as unusable when it freezes.
#FERC made the right call here in rejecting DOE‚Äôs misguided #NORP Grid Reliability and Resilience Pricing proposal. This proposal would have hurt electricity markets &amp; cost ratepayers significantly while not actually achieving its stated goals of improving grid resilience.
This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a proposed Trump Administration coal subsidy that was being masked as a boost to grid resiliency: https://t.co/D0pT76JTwM   As someone who has worked on energy policy for many years, I wanted to share a few thoughts.  1/
#Weatherization dollars also go a LONG way. In 2015, Department of Energy funding attracted $883 million from utilities &amp; states. That's $4.62 for every federal dollar invested.  And those dollars have a great multiplier, generating some $4.50 in benefits for every $1 spent. https://t.co/Y0lVD0AWdf
Care about protecting the most vulnerable Americans when extreme cold hits?  Cold weather hits low-income households hardest, with energy costs representing some 16.3% of their total annual income!  https://t.co/PnFCQaCs8A
Just so we‚Äôre clear, Congress could secure healthcare access for 9 million of our most vulnerable kids...  or spend 22x more &amp; blow $18 billion on an ineffective border wall...  and we already spent 1000x that much on tax cuts for the rich?  Yeah, I'm voting for the kids. #CHIP https://t.co/H9gDymjyfm

Earlier this month I posed these &amp; other critical questions to @EPAScottPruitt during his first appearance before our Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, where I serve as Ranking Member: https://t.co/XQc515P9fY
@EPA I have spent weeks asking critical questions of the @EPA:  - how is the U.S. going to recruit &amp; retain the technical expertise necessary to protect our communities, health &amp; environment? - how can we prevent scientists from leaving &amp; hollowing out the agency‚Äôs technical capacity?
More than 200 scientists and nearly 100 environmental protection specialists have left @EPA this year, amidst widespread denial of #science &amp; devaluing of their work.  This is a bad sign. Public science saves lives &amp; protects our families &amp; our economy.  https://t.co/FPp4Nv5g4L

How are Republican leaders stacking the deck against America‚Äôs middle &amp; working class families this time?

My full statement on today's House vote to approve the #GOPTaxScam: https://t.co/uCq4IfNjv1 https://t.co/WpFRpRLeTv
Despite @HouseGOP claims that the #GOPTaxScam benefits middle-class Americans, MILLIONS of middle-class families will see a tax INCREASE.  In fact, 83% of the tax cuts in this plan go to the top 1% of Americans. https://t.co/mdUStjY902
The American people strongly oppose the #GOPTaxScam The House is voting on now.   Why?   Because they know it will raise taxes on 86 million middle class families &amp; explode the deficit to give massive tax breaks to the wealthy. https://t.co/pkXmVDBUiH
Final House vote is up NEXT  #GOPTaxScam #TaxScamBill https://t.co/6RHMGiqBz6
The #GOPTaxScam hikes taxes on 86 million middle-class families, takes away health coverage from 13 million Americans and increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion. This is a bad deal for American families.   I'm voting NO. https://t.co/rW4dYcKtS6

14. https://t.co/2unzfOqsrj #ANWR
10. Raids our coffers to give lavish gifts to the richest &amp; most powerful corporations in history 11. Gives big tax breaks to inheritances over $11 million 12. Makes the tax code even more complicated 13. All of the modest middle class benefits expire within the first 5-10 years
5b. $1.5T is around $12,000 in new debt for each U.S. household 6. Ignores or raises taxes on 84% of Americans 7. Pushes 13 million Americans off their healthcare 8. Drives up healthcare premiums 10% every year 9. Personally benefits the President &amp; Congress members supporting it
Let me see if I can get these without looking: 1. Raises taxes on anyone making less than $75,000/yr 2. 82% of $$ goes to wealthiest 1% 3. Triggers $25 billion in Medicare cuts 4. Incentivizes job outsourcing to other industrialized nations 5. Blows $1.5 trillion hole in the debt https://t.co/dZ1vVO4I5X
More bad #GOPTaxScam news: ‚ÄúThis perverse design means the more a U.S. multinational shifts jobs and operations to industrialized nations with similar tax rates to the U.S., the more it can get away with shifting more and more profits to tax havens.‚Äù  https://t.co/n3PYlpzKSZ
The House voted tonight to move up tomorrow‚Äôs #GOPTaxScam vote to 10am.  After rushing the bill through Congress with no hearings, limited markup &amp; no transparency. The final bill wasn‚Äôt released until Friday night.   This is no way to govern.
Not good. Not fair. Not right. https://t.co/5nNI9ApnRP

Furious about extra goodies for private jet owners &amp; personal perks that Republican senators scribbled into the margins of their tax bill last night?  This is not over. House &amp; Senate need to reconcile their versions &amp; vote one more time.  Your voices matter, now more than ever. https://t.co/Zc6lZSmO1T
This cannot be overstated. https://t.co/KITQAALAmG
Bottom line: The #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on MILLIONS of America's middle class &amp; working poor families to give huge breaks to some of the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the world.  I voted NO, and if it comes down to it I‚Äôll do it again.  https://t.co/T4ZAK4KhKn
@pmagc1 Hi Patty, Thanks for your note. I included links to references in many of the posts in this #thread. You can find the Joint Committee on Taxation's latest report here: https://t.co/eQWxviopZo.   I hope this helps!  -pt
According to non-partisan Congressional review, by 2027, even individuals making up to $100,000 will see their benefits dry up, and most Americans making less than $75,000/year will actually see a tax increase!   https://t.co/8G6Im9S5af
The #GOPTaxScam gives billions of dollars in breaks to the wealthy while most households end up with less than $100.   Meanwhile the $1.5 TRILLION it adds to the deficit works out to about $12,000 in new debt for every American household. https://t.co/iNlzl8wN5A
Don't forget: we're just hours away from the Senate voting on this absurd #GOPTaxScam and they still haven't released text of a bill!  https://t.co/29PJ3UzTmM
The #GOPTaxScam has so much deficit spending, it would immediately trigger a $25 billion yearly cut to Medicare and more than $100 billion in other cuts that could impact student loans, customs &amp; border enforcement + MUCH more. https://t.co/dfDSrgFTIN
GOP leaders in Washington have been cagey about this, but among friends they are talking about making "structural changes" (i.e. cuts) to Medicare, Social Security and the rest of our social safety net. https://t.co/HiEzngfjAQ
The Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the #GOPTaxScam and found that the budget hole it digs is more than 3x the size of the revenue growth expected. That means this bill puts us $1 TRILLION deeper in debt. https://t.co/snkJ3RcDeH
Amazingly, the Senate version is even worse:  - Evaporates more and more middle class benefits over time, most cuts turn into substantial tax increases by 2027  - Healthcare repeal pushes 13 million off their insurance, drives premiums up an additional 10%/year
Here are a few of the people that would be hurt by the House version of the #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/CIEGy3xGPc
The #GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on MILLIONS of middle class and working poor families, provides little or no benefit to millions more, but gives huge tax breaks to billionaires and wealthy corporations.   Those are the facts.
If this #GOPTaxScam passes, the wealthiest 1% of Americans will receive more benefits over the first 10yrs than the other 99% combined.   Yes, you read that right.
Republican leaders in the Senate are scrambling to vote on the #GOPTaxScam TODAY. There‚Äôs at least one very big problem with that:  There üëè is üëè no üëè bill.  https://t.co/29PJ3UzTmM

This debt isn't free. Just paying the interest is going to cost us $51 billion over the next 10 years. https://t.co/PmFd0PF1dA
If that doesn‚Äôt make you rethink this plan consider one other note in the report:  ‚ÄúAn increase in interest rates generated by the increase in Federal debt is expected to increase the cost of Federal debt service by about $51 billion‚Äù  That‚Äôs 51 billion dollars just gone. Whoosh.

This is bad.

Trickle üëè down üëè doesn‚Äôt üëè work
NO surprise that #GOPTaxScam is deeply unpopular -- raising taxes on half the country to give more breaks to the wealthiest people &amp; corporations doesn't really have a populist ring to it.   What IS a surprise is Republican leaders falling all over themselves to vote for it. https://t.co/HaRjyKWe3s
Clear evidence Republican leaders are gearing up to slash Medicare &amp; Social Security.   Remember, the #GOPTaxScam ADDS $1.5 trillion to the deficit &amp; gives more billions to billionaires. This was never about fiscal responsibility. https://t.co/twAsgn1v0c
The Historic Preservation Tax Credit has delivered real value, jobs and economic redevelopment throughout New York State. The #GOPTaxScam eliminates it.   h/t @ah_Spotlight showing impact on our region: https://t.co/haBWWD9Cxe https://t.co/A2hCD6ybDZ
That chart doesn't even include the repeal of a tax gift on inheritances of more than $11 million or huge tax breaks for the wealthiest corporations. It also doesn't show painful cuts that will be triggered by trlilions in deficit spending to pay for this ridiculous boondoggle.
The #GOPTaxScam is designed to confuse you, but it's built on a simple set of ideas:  1. Raise taxes on working poor &amp; head-fake middle class with tiny breaks that turn into tax increases in 5-10 years.   2. Give huge permanent tax breaks to wealthiest individuals &amp; corporations. https://t.co/HnqkitFdFD
More evidence the #GOPTaxPlan is bad news for New York: eliminating the Historic Preservation Tax Credit "would kill a lot of the rehabilitation jobs that we‚Äôre able to do in historic downtowns... It‚Äôll make the kind of rehabs we do impossible." https://t.co/T7jif7oVzU

Sad but true. It's called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit &amp; it helps employers hire veterans with service-connected disabilities, are unemployed or who receive food assistance benefits: https://t.co/psXFEKGB5w  America, this is what a #GOPTaxPlan looks like. https://t.co/5mdSMe0Rp0
According to @CenterOnBudget, the #GOPTaxScam will give millionaires a $200,000 average tax break next year: https://t.co/7v9vwgzppk  I believe real economy-growing #taxreform should build from the middle out. So let‚Äôs say you had an extra $200,000. What would you do with it?
This credit has helped drive $390+ million in jobs &amp; economic redevelopment in Albany, NY &amp; even more in our region:  Cohoes: +$139.8 million Saratoga Springs: +$101 million  Schenectady: +$15.99 million Troy: +$50.3 million  Our #UpstateNY economies lose big with the #GOPTaxScam
Many, many betrayals in the Ryan-McConnell #GOPTaxScam. One that will hurt America's historic cities is the elimination of a vital economic redevelopment tool called the Historic Preservation Tax Credit: https://t.co/twOJodbFpI

Feels like architects of Ryan-McConnell #GOPTaxScam bill just sat down &amp; asked themselves, ‚Äúwhat is the absolute least amount of good we can do for middle class &amp; working poor families to sneak through this massive windfall we really want to give donors &amp; wealthy corporations?‚Äù https://t.co/WqA1FRvnn3

Phone lines, social media &amp; mailboxes are being flooded with comments from people demanding that Congress stop doing the bidding of the biggest donors &amp; corporate lobbyists &amp; get back to doing the peoples‚Äô work.  Those calls, emails, letters &amp; social media posts need to continue.
I want to be clear: this fight is not over. The phones in my Washington office starting ringing off the hook today, just as they did each time Republicans tried to gut the American healthcare system earlier this year.
Republican leaders in the House knew they would need to rush this kind of bad news through before the American people could find out what they were up to.   That‚Äôs exactly what they did with today‚Äôs vote.
50% of the benefits under this plan go directly to the wealthiest 1%.   36 million Americans will face higher taxes, many of them New Yorkers.   This plan will hurt teachers, students, veterans, people with cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs and anyone with a job that can be moved overseas.
I remain strongly opposed to the Ryan-McConnell plan to raise taxes on millions of middle class families, rip away their healthcare &amp; explode the deficit, just to give massive tax handouts to some of the wealthiest individuals &amp; corporations in the world. #GOPTaxScam
The House just voted to betray millions of working families in New York and all across the country.  I voted NO.  https://t.co/gqQM4tQk0V https://t.co/cDPT8F8ZMq
@AARP @HouseGOP The #GOPTaxScam:  Step 1: Give tax breaks to wealthiest &amp; corporations Step 2: Explode deficit Step 3: Make American seniors &amp; their families pay for it  The #GOPTaxScam will mean a $25 billion cut to #Medicare in 2018 ALONE! Seniors &amp; people with disabilities won‚Äôt stand for it.
@AARP @HouseGOP Republicans are exploding the deficit w/their #GOPTaxScam, all so they can turn around and cut #Medicare.  America's seniors deserve better than having to foot the bill so billionaires &amp; wealthy corporations get a tax break.
@AARP .@HouseGOP plans to eliminate the medical expense tax deduction with their #GOPTaxScam.   @AARP did a state-by-state analysis of how that will impact seniors: https://t.co/A686IEL6Xa   Also not great.
.@AARP looked at how the #GOPTaxScam will affect Americans age 65+.   Turns out millions of U.S. seniors (and future seniors!) get nothing. Millions more will see tax increases.  Not great. https://t.co/Jox7grupR6
What's actually in the #GOPTaxScam bill being voted on TODAY?  *Higher taxes for 36 million Americans  *13 million people lose healthcare  *Health insurance premiums spike  *Medicare cut by $25 billion  *Cuts tax relief for teachers, students, veterans, small businesses... https://t.co/sYRuSFKFDG
Every single crumb of a benefit promised to middle class families in the Senate‚Äôs #GOPtaxscam bill will expire within 5-10 years.  Tax breaks for millionaires, billionaires &amp; wealthy corporations? Permanent.

Facts = bad news for Ryan-McConnell tax plan: raises taxes for 36 million Americans, adds $1.5+ trillion to U.S. deficit &amp; gives big breaks to billionaires &amp; wealthy corporations.   And now it rips #Healthcare from 13 million Americans. #NotOnePenny

This is not a joke, a drill or a test of the emergency political broadcast system.   The #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on millions of Americans, specifically targets New Yorkers, &amp; now rips #healthcare from millions more to pay for big breaks for millionaires &amp; wealthy corporations.
Let‚Äôs be clear, repealing the individual mandate will drive up premiums &amp; lead to MILLIONS more uninsured Americans. These are facts. #GOPTaxScam

The Ryan-McConnell tax bill is overflowing with kickbacks &amp; handouts for the richest families &amp; wealthiest corporations on the backs of our middle class &amp; working families.  Another broken promise getting rammed through Congress by the President &amp; GOP leaders. Don't stay silent!
Many of America's veterans also depend on the same education, home mortgage and medical expense deductions that help countless middle class &amp; working poor families every year.
@thehill The Ryan-McConnell Tax Plan blows a $1.7+ trillion hole in our deficit. That's about $12,000 per American household.   What does that pay for?  - big breaks for richest families &amp; wealthy corporations - higher taxes for millions of Americans - cuts to #Medicare &amp; our safety net
The #GOPTaxScam repeals the Disabled Access Tax Credit that helps small businesses provide access to disabled individuals, a group that includes many of America's veterans.
The #GOPTaxScam also means higher costs &amp; less opportunity for America's veterans.   First, it repeals the Work Opportunity Tax Credit that encourages employers to hire veterans who have a service-connected disability, are unemployed, or who receive supplemental food assistance.
The #GOPTaxScam bill even eliminates the $250 above-the-line deduction for teachers' out of pocket expenses.   Remember, our average American teacher spends about $500 of their own money every year to make sure their students have what they need.
Wait, there's more. The #GOPTaxScam also hurts students paying tuition &amp; anyone paying student loans. Around half of the individuals &amp; families that take these deductions make less than $50,000/year.
11,000+ individuals &amp; families in #NY20 making under $75,000/year filed returns with a combined $185 million in medical expenses in 2014.  Ripping up this deduction takes money out of the pockets of New York seniors &amp; families with major healthcare costs. These are our neighbors!
It gets worse! #GOPTaxPlan rips up medical deductions even though 73% of people who claim it earn less than $75,000/year.
#GOPTaxPlan raises taxes on MILLIONS of America‚Äôs middle class &amp; working poor families to pay for HUGE tax breaks for millionaires &amp; wealthy corporations.   ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"Trickle-down" doesn't work. So why move $1.5 trillion frm working families to corporations &amp; the wealthiest few?  Good question #GOPtaxbill https://t.co/jx7PlvnaHT
The #GOPtaxbill = $1 trillion in permanent tax breaks for millionaires &amp; corporations. Nearly all middle class benefits would expire.
Middle-class families lose big under the #GOPtaxbill while the wealthiest Americans &amp; corporations get big tax breaks. Not good &amp; not right. https://t.co/6mflA77NoS

.@realDonaldTrump promised the GOP #BillionairesFirst tax plan would work for the Middle Class.   Another broken promise. #NotOnePenny
GOP wants you to believe the estate tax has something to do with our Middle Class, but it impacts fewer than 5,500 very wealthy families.
President Reagan, President Bush 41, President Bush 43. All tried "trickle down" tax cuts for the rich.   It never worked. #NotOnePenny
GOP #BillionairesFirst tax plan eliminates medical expense deduction ‚Äì despite the #fact 73% of ppl who claim it earn less than $75,000/yr.
Under GOP tax plan, Americans with cancer, ALS, etc will no longer be able to write off medical costs. #NotOnePenny
I will keep digging through details but this does not appear to be the relief New Yorkers &amp; American people are asking for right now. (8/)
AND it forgets about the workers that make corporate and broader economic success possible! (7/)
Bottom line: cuts for the rich, heavier burdens on working families at a time when corporate profits &amp; income inequality @ record highs (6/)
Even worse, it targets New York taxpayers by slashing the state &amp; local deduction &amp; cutting the mortgage interest deduction in half. (5/)
It blows a trillion-dollar hole in our deficit, threatening long-term future of Social Security, Medicare &amp; the entire U.S. safety net (4/)
GOP bill would slash taxes that only apply to millionaires &amp; billionaires and raise taxes for those in the lowest-income bracket (3/)
...entirely at the expense of America‚Äôs middle class and working families who haven‚Äôt gotten a real raise in decades (2/)
Still reviewing 429-page Republican tax bill but already clear it would be a HUGE giveaway to corporations &amp; the wealthiest families (1/) https://t.co/eHiIOrTCOp

@DeptofDefense U.S. servicemembers deserve support, not a capricious #TransBan, and ALL deserve the utmost respect for the burdens they carry for all of us
@DeptofDefense Bottom line: the nasty #TransBan is a slap in the face to #TransTroops &amp; all service members who risk everything to protect us.
@DeptofDefense If there was correspondence before he tweeted out the disgraceful #TransBan, the White House must prove it &amp; show Congress the documents.
The President tweeted the #TransBan apparently w/o @DeptofDefense Pentagon. If true, represents a major breakdown in military communication.
Joined with 114 of my colleagues to send a letter to General Mattis today asking for documents on the disgraceful Trump #TransBan.
Today‚Äôs action is no different. Shame on the President for this dangerous rule that sets our country backward &amp; limits women‚Äôs #reprorights!
Since #POTUS first day in office, his White House &amp; GOP-controlled Congress have relentlessly attacked women‚Äôs #reprorights &amp; access to care
To be clear, this will let virtually anyone (bosses, health plans, schools) discriminate against women by refusing to cover #birthcontrol.
We cannot, we must not rollback this progress. But that‚Äôs exactly what President #Trump‚Äôs anti #birthcontrol #contraception rule would do.
Remember: thanks to the #ACA, 62.4 million US women have access to #birthcontrol without out-of-pocket costs &amp; save an average of $255/year. https://t.co/tg7ISW7BEj

We should be growing services &amp; private partnerships to train returning veterans &amp; all who need jobs to thrive in new clean energy careers.

Also worked with my colleagues to advance our clean energy economy &amp; jobs in #manufacturing of solar panels, state-of-the-art wind turbines.
I strongly support legislation to close loopholes for companies that outsource jobs &amp; replace with tax credits to help biz hire in the U.S.
Congress is working to make up lost ground. As a member of the House Manufacturing Caucus, I strongly support the Make it in America agenda!
It also makes the US economy more competitive. President's budget completely eliminates funding for this important #manufacturing resource.
the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program helps small &amp; medium-sized manufacturers in all 50 states &amp; #PuertoRico...
Unfortunately, the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) Institutes program is partially de-funded in the President‚Äôs Budget.
More than 5 million U.S. #manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2000, most of them due to automation, lousy trade deals and off-shoring.
Each manufacturing job creates 3 to 4 other jobs in research, development &amp; process design, and needed supply chain and post sales services.
#DidYouKnowThat America's manufacturing sector employs 9 percent of the United States workforce and makes up 11.7% of our GDP?
1 in 7 U.S. private sector jobs depends on our manufacturing base. Last year manufacturers contributed $2.18 trillion to the U.S. economy!

Sad to hear of the passing of former Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, a true &amp; longtime advocate for the cause of mental health parity.
@CDCgov Let's follow the facts we have from science, medicine &amp; experience and take the steps most likely to deliver results before it‚Äôs too late.
@CDCgov My hometown of Amsterdam &amp; thousands of cities, towns &amp; villages just like it all across the U.S. are now on the front lines of this fight.
@CDCgov Whatever you believe about #addiction, there is one common, absolute &amp; indisputable truth: we must act quickly or things will only get worse
@CDCgov These sobering numbers, a death rate = one commercial airliner crashing every day for a year, should be a wake-up call for all of us.
@CDCgov That puts # of overdose deaths last year higher than deaths at the peak of HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, another true health emergency.
2016 was the deadliest year yet. @CDCgov estimates 64,000 ppl died of drug overdoses last year, an astonishing 21% increase from 2015!
More institutions should learn from them. I will be offering a bill to restore #Medicaid addiction treatment to patients 30 days pre-release
We are not without success stories. Rikers Island Correctional Facility has maintained successful medication-assisted treatment since 1987.
Individuals reentering the community after incarceration are 8x more likely to suffer an overdose in their first seven days out of prison.
In our nation‚Äôs jails &amp; prisons, incarcerated people are routinely denied medication for #addiction because of the stigma around treatment.
Today, just 1 in 5 individuals struggling with #opioid use are receiving treatment for this disease.  We need to fix the treatment gap.
"Community coalitions are making real progress preventing drug use &amp; education youth. Flat funding leaves them with less &amp; less over time."
"Family members, friends &amp; neighbors desperate to find treatment find themselves on yearlong waiting lists buried in bureaucratic red tape"
"The devastating struggle, pain and loss of the #opioid epidemic has touched many places like Amsterdam [NY]."
"Amsterdam is my home. And in the span of just two weeks last December, my hometown lost four people to fentanyl overdose deaths."
Combating the #opioid epidemic: Why #science should guide policymaking‚Üí https://t.co/lC8PxeVKh4 #OpioidSolution
@BobCusack @thehill Thanks to @BobCusack &amp; my friends at @thehill for hosting this important &amp; timely discussion as we work toward a fact-driven #OpioidSolution
@BobCusack @thehill "The numbers, 21% growth from 2015 to 2016, are instructive... We should take heed." #OpioidSolution
@BobCusack @thehill "We're not going to be able to go forward much longer without a greater emphasis on treatment &amp; prevention." #OpioidSolution
@BobCusack @thehill "Medication assisted treatment... with its order of flexibility, [provides] in a way that responds most fully to their need" #OpioidSolution
@BobCusack @thehill "All hands on deck is the approach we now require."
@BobCusack @thehill "To see the impact this [epidemic] is having, you just have to look at the obituary columns." #opioidepidemic
@BobCusack @thehill "I am impressed with my local communities in Niskayuna [and] in Troy... the numbers show dependency has been reduced tremendously."
@BobCusack @thehill "We're not going to stop this [epidemic] just through arrests &amp; incarceration. We need to invest in services and in research." #opioidcrisis
@BobCusack @thehill "When people come to that moment of clarity and seek treatment, we need to be there." #opioidepidemic
@BobCusack @thehill "As I visit those individuals struggling with this illness, I hear they are forced to wait as much as a year for treatment."
@BobCusack @thehill "Getting rid of preexisting conditions would have meant people suffering from #addiction could have been denied care... a brutal outcome."
@BobCusack @thehill "We need to go forward seeing [the #opioid epidemic] as a disease &amp; addressing it as a crisis."
@BobCusack @thehill "There are signs that this crisis is getting worse... it impacts all of us"
@BobCusack @thehill Starting now! https://t.co/RZxuqHf5Qs

@USCBO Senate #Trumpcare eliminates #ACA cost controls on insurer bureaucracy, letting them go back to using sickness to pad their profits.
@USCBO .@USCBO expects 1/2 of U.S. population 2b affected by states letting insurers cut maternity care, prescription drug coverage, mental health.
@USCBO "net premiums for older people ineligible for subsidies... would be much higher under this legislation than otherwise" - @USCBO #Trumpcare
@USCBO .@USCBO: ‚Üë‚Üë in uninsured "larger among older people with lower income" especially those 50-64 making less than 200% poverty level.
@USCBO .@USCBO: "Coverage for maternity care, mental health care, rehabilitative... treatment... could be at risk... &amp; become extremely expensive."
@USCBO More from @USCBO on #Trumpcare: - middle class families pay more - min wage families pay over 1/2 annual income before deductible kicks in
According to @USCBO, Senate #Trumpcare will mean 4 million Americans lose employer-provided insurance next year. Another 5 million by 2022.
Senate #Trumpcare imposes a 6-month lockout from coverage if you lose insurance for 63 or more days.  https://t.co/vEriVYgjZQ
As many as 27 million Americans who get health insurance from a job could face rationed care under #Trumpcare with annual &amp; lifetime limits.
Senate #Trumpcare makes coverage more expensive for 500,000 middle class Americans, cutting income eligibility even closer to poverty level.
EHBs are a heavy cut. A rider to restore coverage for lung cancer in a plan that omits it = $72,980 more, a breast cancer rider = $28,660.
15.5 million U.S. cancer survivors lose Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) in Senate #Trumpcare‚Üíinsurers don't have to cover their conditions.
14 million Americans have health coverage thanks to Medicaid expansion under the #ACA. Senate #Trumpcare would reverse that.
Medicaid also covers: - 30% of U.S. adults with disabilities - 60% of U.S. children with disabilities - 76% of America's poorest children
As a reminder, Medicaid covers - half of all U.S. births - 39% of U.S. children - 64% of nursing home residents - 1.75 million U.S. veterans
Senate #Trumpcare cuts Medicaid by $772 billion. 77 million Americans, one in five, depend on Medicaid for their care.

@POTUS @FBI @TheJusticeDept @VP 9-When &amp; how were @POTUS &amp; @VP warned about #Flynn concerns?  10-Does Putin have undue influence over current high-lvl WH officials?  (5)
@POTUS @FBI 7-Were @TheJusticeDept &amp; Rosenstein asked to help cover up Russia investigation as real cause for Comey firing?  8-What did @VP know?   (4)
@POTUS 5-Did @POTUS pressure former @FBI Dir. Comey to stop investigating #Flynn?  6-Did @POTUS really ask him to start arresting journalists?  (3)
@POTUS 3-Why was Oval Office Trump-Lavrov mtg closed to U.S. media? 4-Why was Putin's state-owned media outlet credentialed &amp; invited instead?  (2)
Many outstanding questions: 1-What sensitive intel did @POTUS share w/Putin's top aides? 2-What US intelligence assets are now at risk?  (1)

The disaster known as #Trumpcare was finally announced this week:   ‚Üì patient access ‚Üì quality of care ‚Üì affordability  #BrokenPromises
#Trumpcare would be a disaster: - Lower taxes on wealthiest 0.1% - Higher premiums for seniors - Unstable system - Rationed care
#Trumpcare finally showed its face last night:   ‚Üë pocket costs for seniors ‚Üë burden on working families ‚Üë # of uninsured Americans
#Trumpcare bill would be a disaster for US healthcare system. Missed my analysis on @MorningEdition? Listen here: https://t.co/avsUZRXJ64
