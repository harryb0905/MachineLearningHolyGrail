This young man has an expulsion on his record because a coach decided he wanted to use his authority to walk up to him and talk down on him? Instead of having his own coach speak to him. This half investigation is because this yng man future isn’t a priority for this school. https://t.co/ss1Z6G9KoQ
This is weak and this is sad. This handbook doesn’t come with the truth that this young man and his mother have asked for and deserves. We understand “rules” but we also understand they are enforced when y’all see fit. Hence the girls basketball coach still having a job. https://t.co/ss1Z6G9KoQ
