Second example of family openly shaming family to force political shift. Same happened with Harris I’m NC. Shows some things can still trump partisan posturing https://t.co/H1cMXo3eiK

The wall is not about human trafficking...it is about trafficking in the politics of persuasion. Big talk...big lie. The proof of Trump’s real concern for trafficking? Take a listen... https://t.co/t27ekxL37L

I hear you. He has credibility issues. And yet the trump argument that he was out to get him is undermined by fact he only leaked about Clinton problems. Just like Comey. https://t.co/xOloE7l6nk
This is about answering why all these trumpets lied about Russia if there is nothing to hide and why potus messes with a probe he says he doesn’t care about. I don’t anticipate massive prosecutions. Things can be wrong and not be crimes. Potus didn’t go under oath for a reason. https://t.co/F1Exu1CXtd
I think you have watched too many movies. Just because we are Italian does not mean we talk “mob” :) https://t.co/XXfXu8sIpd
FWIW - this is something to listen to and remember. While KAC is wrong that report is up to mueller (it is up to AG) the chance that we get stiffed in disclosure is more real than many anticipate. Everyone loses if there is not a report that you get to see https://t.co/KOByIEA9JZ
Mueller has found plenty. Unprecedented lying by and around this president about russia-related matters. Why? And if you listen or watch anything I do you would know that you are way off base about my expectations. Know more; tweet less https://t.co/KvMCoAzLvD
Politics has always been about persuasion.  There have always been bs spin and lies and that’s why there is such disaffection - and this potus benfitted from the low expectations of credibility and character. https://t.co/gZdWhIzz0g
She has never been implicated personally. And she is too smart to ignore all the lying that has been shown. The lies are the burden for this admin. Why lie if nothing to hide? Why mess with probe if no worries about conclusions? https://t.co/BwZIjmaC3M
It is exactly how journalism works ... that’s why your administration chooses the comfort of Fox. The answer to every criticism is not “fake news” and if you are going to assail the credibility of someone you must prepare to defend your own. https://t.co/bzWnYfIAXk
Those who tell you Mueller needs to find crimes: He is not just looking for crimes... this is about understanding whether anyone had contact or even coordinated with those involved in Russian interference in our election. https://t.co/xigzpiz6ef
When you don’t have substance driving politics you get labels. And we are in a pit of labels as proxies for actual messaging. Other than smearing the left - which may happen from these efforts - what is this potus selling? https://t.co/GDZfHq18Dk

Mr. President, we thought you learned there are not good people on both sides when it comes to bigotry...and that there is no such thing as bigotry that is ok. What you ignore you empower and in your case...what you ignore you may have to own. https://t.co/9jrVF7aasm
The President used to love to use "El Chapo" as an example of why we needed to get tough on the border...but when the truth of the cartel's operation came out, it proved that a wall isn't the fix we need. https://t.co/9LIemldT7B

You realize this is bs propaganda, right? You know no journalist would ever say anything like that, right? The point is simple and obvious: seizing on murders to cast a shadow on all migrants is wrong and political pandering. And to say a wall is how to stop gun violence is bs. https://t.co/oaFGIV5ozi
If potus is so curious or concerned about what mueller is doing ... why doesn’t he just ask? https://t.co/qEQpQnUTCD
Can’t quit on dialogue. That’s the job and it’s my belief - truth wins. There is room for wanting more barriers and better security and also being humane and respecting the mandate of American diversity and inclusion. https://t.co/DXazNKQxbD
I support the truth which is easy to find, maga-man. Physical barriers matter but we are not a wall away from solving what potus exaggerated as a crisis. Potus on record assuming those who enter illegally are likely to be rapists. That’s bs. Don’t be a lemming. https://t.co/JP0uPI8Wlx
“And some I assume are good people”. For years potus has wasted no opportunity to exaggerate the criminality, terror profile, and circumstances driving migrants. He has played to every bigotry and fear aspect he can. And you lap it up...spud juice. https://t.co/t3H0sIbSp1

For now. Hopefully this has made him fearful of going this way again. At least if he declares nat emerg the tension is about courts. If he clears that the. We have a real problem of what money he is taking from people and places that need it just to build a farcical wall https://t.co/wkf3WCeGfW
He forced people to hurt for no good reason! No praise for that. Did only decent move there is here. End it. He started it, McConnell sat meekly, so he had to end it. Actually surprised he did. didn’t think hardship would move him. Guess he has a thing for timely air travel https://t.co/TQlrIw3eGA
Fair point,  but imagine if he hadnt done it. Potus has showed great ability to hurt people for no good reason. At least it is over...for now. https://t.co/4aaf5gWmLV
As long as he stopped making people hurt for no good reason, speechify away. https://t.co/JfEi68EEbH

Wrong. The crisis is increased flow the system can’t handle; the conditions people are forced to survive as they wait.

Always and forever. Potus must learn to surrender the me to the we. And by the way, the point is not that Mexico paying was right -  but he said this is about “promises kept” and the Mexico part was a key part of the promise! https://t.co/taNurf4qYW
Physical barriers help but they don’t solve the drugs or terror threats as potus sells you. His urgency should be equipping POE and bolstering airport detection. Farce vs Fact. https://t.co/LWew6ZncpJ
Shutdown politics suck. Always have. The idea of people paying the price for politicians inability to make a deal is horrible. But here - people are suffering, we are all losing, over a vanity project. The crisis potus describes is not solved by his farcical solution. https://t.co/8m1Wgczd5t
Do what you say and have Mexico pay. https://t.co/8tC7Fojccw
Shutdown may wipe out all growth for a quarter. You are crush workers and endanger the people you took an oath to protect in the name of a wall that won’t keep them safe from the crisis you created. #BeBest https://t.co/M5QfSvUr26
Economists are saying shutdown may wipe out all growth for quarter, the loss is already estimated at ~6b and even if none of that were true they were supposed to be all about the workers! https://t.co/mMbxATV2aO
Have you seen this warning from the air traffic controllers? Did you know they were doing the job at basically half capacity and often with broken equipment? Is it worth this hardship - and risk - for a “wall”? https://t.co/WyAEt8gkNY
Is not funding ice the right call? https://t.co/pWxk0xwg6i
Wonder what would have happened if he stayed? By most accounts, potus is keeping his own counsel now - and we see the results https://t.co/7wkIIiE7XC
Remember we know mueller is looking at public statements in assessing obstruction. https://t.co/xtQmFVNQZ0
Does fair mean gutting DACA? Does fair mean you not allowing votes that may have ended this weeks ago? https://t.co/rcmFN49qw2
Bottom line...the shutdown is supposedly okay because we have a border crisis that demands a wall. That's not the truth.   The truth is, POTUS doesn't have to invent crises anymore...he has made a real one. A shutdown he promised you on national TV. https://t.co/uQ0hlSlaWv

Confusion persists about the Trump Tower Moscow deal... #CuomoPrimeTime #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/5VPGFmAFwl
Nah - people thought I meant the senator needed to rebut, and I don’t think that. If you saw my thread that’s clear but the first tweet was worded poorly. Better to clear it up. So I did. https://t.co/BMkVBvoohv
Deleted my original tweet because it was taken literally the opposite way that I intended it. Sen Harris has no duty to justify any such accusation, let alone a birtherism attack. You accuse, you prove. That was my point. Apologize for confusion.
I agree with all of this. The tweet was meant to put onus on accuser. Not Harris. That is the lesson of birtherism. Deleting original tweet to make this clear. Apologies. https://t.co/6vAHXNjDtr
Once more potus says if he doesnt think something is fair, it is fake. https://t.co/tNqQdQh8vB

You can argue Cohen should discuss everything but reps have said they would defer to mueller and Cohen lawyer says they will too... https://t.co/ddZ7gIUHgb
For those who wanted former Trump lawyer Cohen to be grilled about all the key aspects of investigation - probably won’t get what you want - https://t.co/ddZ7gIUHgb
Agreed https://t.co/2Im016s3jK
I hear you. I don’t agree. I don’t see two sides here nor did I there. You accuse, you approve. Was never for Obama or Harris to respond unless there is credible, corroborated proof of the accusation https://t.co/EVTLyrxr11
I owe you no such response. You accuse, you prove. First, whatever my hair is it is better than your’s...second, if it is an actual dead animal on my head - does that count as a toupee? https://t.co/hdt3zgJqh0
No one ever owes an accuser proof of their accusation or rebuttal. That’s the point I am making. As for the second part, wait for the probe report and the conclusions will follow from there. https://t.co/BEduQbrNVT
That bullshit. It is on the ACCUSER to prove what they say about Harris. Not on her. That’s my point. That’s the only point here. https://t.co/rIQb3t6afB
Talking abt the accusers. Not the senator. Read, think...this is Twitter...don’t just assume things. Ask. They made the accusation. They need to back it up. Period. https://t.co/0DiOwNa4CN
Go look at Obama scenario - first it was the mother then the father then no records then fake records then about his faith and his name ... if the accusers keep shifting to avoid fact and harness animus, we must call it out. Period. Ok?!?!? https://t.co/a1Oqh6nZao
This line of deflection would be much more compelling if the probe hadn’t generated so much contact and legit questions and charges and convictions - and if potus weren’t a central figure and constant source of lies about the same. https://t.co/T5f8z5LeRa
This is detailed and squares with @CNN reporting on this in general. Amazing how blame is the obsession and the overarching point of how to do deal with provocation and the need to be better to one another is lost in the left/right blame game https://t.co/XAocPdz6vG
As with many avenues of pursuit, there is a potential crime, certainly a potential wrongdoing once again involving those around potus and a central question of what potus knew and when https://t.co/PRK6NvJF3u

Why did the kid get in his face and the others cheer him on in a way that seemed disrespectful? Why is the kid’s school looking at it? https://t.co/7dAY0iOdGG
Whatever...all these responses about how dems should take it. They offered this to potus with 25b and his righty rulers forced legal immigration restrictions and complaints about how much for how long and for what - and trump walked away https://t.co/CBpwQl6ct8
not about guilt/innocence; about how we treat one another/how we confront what we oppose. No need to deny the obvious, or to exaggerate it either. And telling me that this happd with some lefty kids another time - doesn’t make anything better. https://t.co/Qz84z12X9M
Supporting potus does not require for you to call what is obvious, fake. These are dumb kids displaying a dislike of “others” which has been given political currency recently. https://t.co/JhmASn0thO
And all this “he had the right” - not the right analysis...something being ok if not illegal is not the only measure of civility or what is right. We see too much of this these days, people for some political reason being insulting or worse to what they oppose. https://t.co/uru82trqIJ
The difference between love and hate on display. https://t.co/uru82trqIJ
The kid did a stupid thing...call it out for what it is, don’t compound it by mitigating it for political purposes. https://t.co/wSEgRAiFFZ
Key: more proof dems are not anti-security or physical barriers. Left and right have funded fencing for years. How much and where - areas of debate and disagreement.  Trump’ farcical “new wall” is just that, a fake exaggeration of the status quo https://t.co/WseCiJRSK1
@jaketapper really isolated Rudy and Gillibrand on key issues. A lot of ground in one show https://t.co/M2BkKXqlFY
Add to analysis: his offer is a version of the what they offered INITIALLY, they then made a deal and potus then walked away under pressure from same righties he is catering to now. https://t.co/6mmMBLOVTU
An ironic criticism https://t.co/DbfigcJJyQ
Because this is abt public persuasion.  And @jaketapper isolated it and exposed it for all to see. Bravo. https://t.co/CD4CiQMVgR
Asha identifies what will be a key aspect of probe, not the idea of things being illegal (like a Moscow tower) but that they lied and potus knew and or enabled the same wrongdoing. https://t.co/lQz2EGpNT2

@CuomoPrimeTime -where things stand given Mueller team weighing in on the buzzfeed story about Cohen, potus, and perjury. We have people who have made these cases on where we go and we have a gop senator who spent an hour with potus about what will end the shutdown
White House denies potus directed Cohen to lie to Congress. They don’t deny that people in admin helped Cohen plan the testimony and whether or not potus knew about those plans. Narrow answer to insulate potus from worst suggestion.
Again ... this is his go to in good times and bad. Keep the base scared. https://t.co/oHb15WjwF3
When all else fails? What else has potus tried? He has been pushing the us faje crisis since he learned it from Steve King https://t.co/7vgEYqG1VQ
Read: Muslim=bad. More bs “brown menace”. When will potus learn creating false crises leads no where good? That’s why he wound up shutting down govt for no good reason. https://t.co/yWH0kmkIlz
@AndyOstroy Call 8669676887 and let’s discuss on my sxm show. Board is packed but I will look for your name when you get through.
Never did. Trump owns shutdown. Pelosi is best player in the game right now and she will have to be part of a solution. That’s my point. https://t.co/i35SqOqMok
But he does like to deny allegations. But not here, why? Probably worst one to date criminally... https://t.co/lyvKmQO8qA
Why the obvious evasion, where is the denial from you that you did not know about or motivate efforts to shape cohen’s lies to Congress? https://t.co/3ZWOknItJX
One good sign is potus pushback by lawyer is to tell us not to believe Cohen and he was not their source apparently. https://t.co/rL9ONYmlUA
I have not criticized anything or anyone. This is standard procedure. On something like this all of us try to match reporting to build the credibility of the assertions. That’s journalism. https://t.co/rL9ONYmlUA
Barriers are part of the solution but otherwise I agree. The point is to do what can be done to get potus to a deal where he does t get as much as he wanted. https://t.co/TZ6XTsGFwJ
Always the case. Of course, depends on who sources are and what they showed to back it up. Either way, it is too heavy to play with until more reporting confirms. https://t.co/pdWyfE7ESv
I think you stated it better here. And you are right by all accounts. Wall helps, but not the fix potus sells. And his crisis talk is bs. And his demonizing of who comes is too. https://t.co/BquwSbxDYU
The buzzfeed story is a powerful allegation. So powerful that if we can’t match the reporting I can’t really do anything with it. One of reporters said on @NewDay that they have not seen evidence from sources. Have to go slow because it matters too much. Major crime if true
Not sure about override on our reporting but it is shameful to close senate and shameful that 2/3 of congress can’t agree to help people. https://t.co/MaJ8iVhoRX
There is too much “we win if they lose” in the air. Makes it hard - but potus makes it even harder by not keeping his word. Still, the suffering should be highest concern and clearly is not https://t.co/TEz9N4qW3u
Wrong. It is not a panacea. Of course a barrier helps.  Dems have funded them many times. And are offering funding now. Potus lies to you about the crisis and how much a wall will help. https://t.co/GI0Ggmlt8w
Matt - read what I have written. Potus has backed off 5b. And rightly so (ironic that he was offered that much once before and walked away). Fencing is needed. Dems know that and you should too. Talk to dhs and CBP. It is about how much and where. https://t.co/gYbNsysvuf
Yes they say that but they don’t say it is a panacea. And the amount and location of barriers and how much of the budget should go to it are absolutely up for debate. Stop drugs? Xrays ar POE help more.  Terror? Foot traffic almost irrelevant. Illegal entry? Airports are the key. https://t.co/ZA6VUYrryd
Disagree. No need to capitulate. I know potus has already backed off the number with folks...problem is, he breaks his word. https://t.co/0XETplL4Xj
She is not the problem but she - and maybe no one better than she - can fashion a solution. Sotu stuff is petty. She will be part of whatever solution ends this. Watch. https://t.co/aTEQ9lY7iN
Last time - I love a a good fight but this nonsense. Find where I ever said pelosi is to blame for any of this. I am asking for the best - and she is clearly the best of the left now - to find a way to help people. Read the tweets for yourself. Think.  Then tweet https://t.co/siWYMO6GeO
I mention McConnell ALL the time. His capitulation is shameful. Pelosi has offered billions for wall funding. And is offering a billion plus right now. You don’t know the facts. https://t.co/7IxGJFLeW0
What is? The blame? Of course. So now what? If you were someone not getting paid would that make it easier for you? I am asking for those who can to try to find a way out of this. And that is the right thing to do. https://t.co/d3P33Qn2Tz
866-967-6887 I would love for people  to call in from 12-2eastern and make the case that what i am saying on shutdown makes me guilty of false equivalency or blame sharing. #LetsGetAfterIt get behind your tweets. Hope to talk soon https://t.co/7DSVvXMSNx
No lectures. Read my thread. The blame is clear. Never seen a senate leader cave to potus like this. But now what? https://t.co/WOwt4suvnv
Never said it was all on pelosi. That’s stupid. I am saying we need them all to figure this out. The “wait for him to cave” and “don’t deal with terrorists” notions are not likely to help the suffering any time soon.  And dems are not anti border security. https://t.co/Ig5HoGbgWm
True - he walked away from two better deals. Shame on him. So now what? We wait? Ok...works for me, but I am not working without pay, worried my family will be hurt. https://t.co/R16OUUzpyl
He knows he won’t get the 5b. His side is already backing off the number. But he is not the deal maker he seeks himself as. He really doesn’t have a clue how to get this done. And every day people are losing in real ways https://t.co/kY5rGY7d4B
Are you really content to wait for potus to just cave? What if it takes a month? Ask @PaulRieckhoff what that would do to vets and some active duty. To all those families. There has to be a better way. https://t.co/0uXgh6dr9A
Really hope it doesn’t get to that point. People should not pay for poor politics. https://t.co/uDkwHyd0rE
Dems offered to fully fund wall. Have funded barriers many times in last. There is actually a law that provides as much from Obama admin. This is about how much and where - not abt dems being anti physical barriers. https://t.co/5a85ntGYl1
This doesn’t work for me. First, US give deals with terrorists all the time. And that tortured analogy aside, potus clearly can’t make a deal himself. No shutdown has ended without a combined effort.  That’s not “both sides” bullshit, it is reality. https://t.co/5Z0PELhfjl
She is clearly the only one on top of her game. I know you don’t want people to keep suffering and you can’t be naive enough to think potus just caves, right?  Only a fool thinks a deal gets made with only one side https://t.co/VwznL4CpW7
Goo follows potus. If he stops making the physical barrier the only thing that matters they will get in line https://t.co/S5d0ioD4hX
They are offering a billion+. The same amount he asked for in his budget! They offered him 25b and he walked away.  Congress would likely vote to end shutdown but McConnell won’t do job. I want pelosi to help figure out a fix but potus has to own this and be motivated to settle https://t.co/x2v6iH5S9e
Remember potus lawyer will only contest idea potus himself did anything wrong. Everyone else- including his kids - could be exposed. https://t.co/qzQjSCW1tZ
So they are rapists and drug dealers but now potus wants them to be able to work? https://t.co/1Z4hmXPnk4
If you would just tell McConnell to do his job shutdown likely over. If you would just accept the deal they offered the first time shutdown over. If you just decide people don’t pay for your mistakes...shutdown over. https://t.co/bh7Hu5MavQ

That people here misconstrue things often and in a hyper-partisan environment left and right can be highly reactive? I get it. I also know I have said trump owns the shutdown from jump. But what about the people suffering. You say wait for him to cave and let congress leave? https://t.co/8ljs0GchiH
I am not sure I am capable of surprise anymore. At my physical I barely even registered a reflex response. https://t.co/G6IYIOEDmS
@ISLY1978 And thanks

No he doesn’t. Nothing will be easy or fast here. And nothing may happen at all. If this is a political process ultimately, it will be about votes. 50%+ in house, 66%+ in senate. https://t.co/mcS5R4x1yD
That could mean lots of things...mueller, sdny, fbi, etc. matters where it came from to consider how close to the information they are or were. https://t.co/MV4wlqcZT9
He is waiting for potus to tell him it is ok to do his job https://t.co/t5XzoYWl5j
We said that https://t.co/CX8dMFazt1
He is afraid. He saw the neck moves. https://t.co/PwO1NEsAhb
Well, why would potus accept Putin’s defense on interference (and it was a lame defense) over his own intel agencies? https://t.co/mle7sNFRro
Amazing how no one on the right cares about that part of the promise. The partisanship is staggering. https://t.co/coVcaImwgS
But how does it get fixed? Looks like only pelosi (until sotu thing) is the one at the top of their game. I don’t get why Congress would go on recess when so many are hurting. https://t.co/7M69zxesUr
That is all true. You are just wrong - I am not blaming both sides. I am asking both sides to try to stop people from suffering. And recess is wrong. https://t.co/3QR9pP1ZWm
While I notice your trumpian “say it a lot to make it so” tactic, the way it works is impeach first, then there could be a prosecution if warranted. That’s is, unless doj changed policy https://t.co/dKWziocZzL
If we are talking impeachment, true. And that is a funny second line. https://t.co/pgFoxdqtYu
We certainly know McConnell has subordinated his duty to his constituents to the wants of potus. https://t.co/UO3g16NJ8y
Maybe...but not about the subpoena perhaps but about what people told investigators. This is not a difficult crime to prove but we have yet to see anyone officially accused of it. https://t.co/aHVJODCuAD
Not how it reads - and says there is substantial corroboration- and I didn’t say it came from mueller. Not my reporting so I don’t know the sourcing. But it is a heavy allegation. https://t.co/Cjm3Issx71
This would not be mistake of law. Potus would go with ignorance altogether and they would have to show he did know.  IF Cohen was told by admin to lie and they helped develop his lies...and if potus was aware...hard to escape. https://t.co/njWPV3cUAW
Yup.  That will be part of the counter narrative when the report comes out. But for all the yap about missing texts, two IG’s looked and there is no good reason to question the probe. There is political reason but not factual reason. https://t.co/L2DtXzd0bj
Every allegation needs proof, whether it goes to a crime or something unethical or just plain wrong. That’s why the mueller report is essential and as much of it must come out as possible. https://t.co/7ySfHsNhuZ
Now google the LEGAL definition and you will see it is a real crime. https://t.co/sdRLUHFbnR
you shouldn’t want them to. https://t.co/uAa8XVG0Ni
Enkignof this bullshit. Watch the show and you would know I always say clearly trump owns the shutdown. The point is to stop the suffering, isn’t it? Can you do that if you are on recess? That’s the point. Only “both sides” here is that all partisans should want this to end https://t.co/7IxGJFLeW0
No - you are looking for balance where there is none. One side was the kkk. That side must always lose. https://t.co/FUsjzxg7pe
Time for you to google “suborning perjury” ... if the report is true...and it is hard to believe something like this came from mueller given how tight they have been...this is a serious crime. While implicated, is this something else potus will plead ignorance about?
Remember - President Trump probably doesn't know anything about who is good at espionage...as he rarely pays attention to briefings. So he is probably just accepting Putin's opinion and then he talks to more media and hides that Putin told him these things... https://t.co/YtgVnlXS9n
You saw it in real-time right here on Cuomo Prime Time. The answer to the central question of Donald Trump's presidency now consists entirely of... "all I know is it wasn't me" https://t.co/EyhUsDIJiI
Thanks for repeating what I have reported to you for weeks. Now, you reset: Do we have a deal? No. Will we have one if everyone stays as is? No. Are people (not you, apparently) getting hurt by this? Yes. Should congress go on recess now? No. That’s my point. https://t.co/t1bbYApHmL
Asking her and all involved to do more is not wrong. I know as well as any what potus has done to get us here. Read my thread. think of the people hurting. Whatever deal is on McConnell’s desk is not getting it done. Why go home? https://t.co/cyXBBrxBBL
I agree 100%.  But still need to make a deal. And the sotu snub plays into potus wheelhouse. We hear more and more stories of people hurting because of shutdown every day. https://t.co/VPe7PqO5G6
No...he is like “oh, that guy on the far right doesn’t like it? Nevermind.” Shameful to then force a shutdown when Pelosi and Schumer offered him what he wanted. But now we are where we are and I can’t believe anyone would take off when people are suffering. Stay and work it out https://t.co/Mu716PQ5Ge
He is not afraid. He is a pawn. He has chided fealty to potus over honoring his oath to the voters. I respect your defense of the speaker you just aren’t getting my point https://t.co/En2LfEpizb
Yes we are shameless trumpers. Every poll shows potus owns the shutdown.  He told you he would on live tv. But to go on recess while people suffer is bs and you know it. All sides must be pressured to get something done. https://t.co/D3N3bD8ZDU
They will and have. They offered 25billion that included physical barriers. They are offering over a billion now for the same. This is abt potus wanting a huge price tag, making the wall more important than all the other border needs, to prove he kept a farcical promise. https://t.co/TJ2PrghoSZ
Everyone knows his poor choice. Focus on progress and less on blame. https://t.co/NvG8xMk5HT
None of this is ok. Enough with the stunts and the letters and the bs. Do what you were ALL elected to do. POTUS and Pelosi must make a deal and vote on it. Stop making good people pay for your bad job performance. https://t.co/y3TNTOXGvb

God forbid - one is too many. But we can all see that the bar is being set to low for satisfaction by the potus team. What was done by campaign and who knew what, matters. What potus knew and lied about, matters - whether a crime or not. https://t.co/lBjQqxKw2b

point that needs no assumption -lawyers have now shrunk their defense to just the idea that potus himself did nothing. That is new and troubling and also not bulletproof. What did potus know and when? Did he lie about the same? Not just abt crimes but credibility to lead https://t.co/W91Ovew3YX

Many are arguing that a national emergency could be the President's only move. Some are even saying it could be a good move. Let's deal with that quickly... https://t.co/uEjdksn4pl
The self-professed greatest deal-maker we ever had as president, has once again gotten nowhere making a deal with Congress. So, now declaring a national emergency may be the President's best option for more wall as he sees it.   #LetsGetAfterIt #CuomoPrimeTime https://t.co/0SvYMasr5Z

Living His message is the command. How should a senator be doing that right now? https://t.co/TpRT0LG2Lx
Huh? McConnell said he won’t put anything on floor unless potus tells him to essentially. The senator is acting like a pawn not a president. https://t.co/1zo84xaTPQ
Shutdowns never really have a winner no matter what the political outcome. This President said he would be different. He could make deals. He would be for all Americans. None of that is playing out in this situation and the worst part is that this hardship doesn't need to happen. https://t.co/gg6sjUigiL
The President has clearly chosen the wall over workers because he refuses to end the shutdown. He fears the retribution of the rabid right. He'll risk the longest shutdown ever, burdening people who need paychecks...just to say he made good on a promise that was always pretend. https://t.co/eh96Nyvzsm
The 5b+ is and if potus had owned the humanitarian side of the argument instead of demonizing migrants he may not be in such a box. https://t.co/w1LoYHqrao
That’s the job. There is a paucity of open minds right now. The facts and the application thereof to the law and ethical standards of good government - are all we have https://t.co/ozGLGQxm62
I don’t see basis for indictment and it should not be the bar for acceptable conduct by president. Your point that no matter comes potus way his base will be forgiving, seems right for now https://t.co/kvPsnNetq5
They have trump owning a shutdown that punishes workers for his inability to get a deal. They are formidable and experienced, and most importantly given the fractured nature of the right...United. https://t.co/vLqG88QRAr

Come up! https://t.co/if2O309YdT
Actually we have never heard this. And the lie has been dismissing the probe as a witch hunt. https://t.co/0ZhvmEY4n7
Again - contact and collusion are political problems, ethical problems, even if not crimes. The bar for acceptable behavior is not merely to commit no felonies. https://t.co/MOcGYp3X0Y
Trump has a forgiving base. The probe is not over but word about rosenstein leaving around feb raises the question of whether the probe could end about the same time - and that’s when we will know what he has in full...if admin allows access to full findings https://t.co/JWzWmH2RC2
Wrong on both. We do point out - often, including in this instance, that we have seen no charge of a crime that goes to the heart of working with Russia...yet...but contact like this with a Russian operative, sharing info and working to change us policy, could well be collusion. https://t.co/FAdWCM8i6w
https://t.co/S6XGe4Ecga
Never been the standard. Read the mandate: any contacts between campaign and those interfering in election. Nice try - actually, pretty lame. https://t.co/Y3O9jpZlWW
They are not ALL bots. Some are (and it is bizarre how we have a WH that constantly mitigates the influence of foreign malefactors when we all see poorly written attacks on here daily). Many - esp trumpers - fight the facts and that is a fight worth having https://t.co/I1tILt6X1Z
Exactly. We lawyers deny what we can for a client. That’s the job in a pleading like this.  Now - we don’t know of any charges based on the suggested collusion. Why not? Either mueller doesn’t think rose to a crime or there is some other aspect of it yet to come. We don’t know. https://t.co/j0TKuGneU5
Why do you quote something that wasn’t said? You guys called it a witch hunt. You harp on the findings of collusion. You now have a collusion collision between the main campaign operative and a know Russian gru and you refuse to deal with it straight up. #pfff https://t.co/bZXseHlWnb
You mean does the contact or collusion amount to a crime? We know there is no charge for the activity at this point.  But the mandate was to probe contacts between campaign and Russians - and this is obvious and compelling proof of same https://t.co/Xt7GEyMC4D
Yes you do - some refuse to accept what they don’t want to be true. https://t.co/lertnA1a7I
And you are rolling in bs. I qualify the reporting because that’s where it stands. Called incisive thought. Google it. The idea that there is nothing to it - the tweet I was responding to - defies what we know, hence the call to regard the facts https://t.co/LDLREIWZBW
We don’t know that. But it was clumsy especially for such pros. I go no further because mueller folks have been a vault https://t.co/azltqNMr10
And he knows it. He marvels at how loyal and adoring they are. Even he doesn’t quite get why it is this way https://t.co/rjkzJvuMvt
We don’t know about full or even a crime but we know the probe ain’t a witch hunt for damn sure and that going at the media is an excuse for not being able to rebut the reporting. #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/GY8MEqB2qS
Can you read? I said the opposite. Come on...new year new you. Think first, then tweet https://t.co/FgHCGn3JRW
Proof of collusion if the legal papers are accurate.

Because simply correcting the stat misses the motivation.  Of course we fact check but part of the journalism must expose the motivation for the deception - especially on this. The “brown menace” deception is pernicious and bleeds into many issues https://t.co/jV9laWUqC5
There is nothing to admit. We have always had barriers. This is not a new or trumpian idea. Potus promised a new wall paid for my Mexico. That was a farce. I believe those who say more barriers needed. But they don’t see walls as panacea.  So why does potus say it is? https://t.co/LxkKeaFXak
Question being missed: media easily shows that stats offered to justify wall are being mangled to mislead by potus et al. We must ask and expose WHY they continue to do this on issue. Farce vs Fact. They know they are misleading.
This shutdown is on you, Mr. President. You told us all that. People are hurting because of you. You know this. End it.  #LetsGetAfterIt #CuomoPrimeTime https://t.co/ncPLaMiuEN

So which former potus told president trump he supported his wall farce? He wouldn’t mislead the American people about something like that would he? Hint: his COS could not answer who told him. https://t.co/ENXnx4roMI

No authority I have encountered thinks we are a wall away. Because the wall is a bs ploy. The real point is physical barriers. All tell me they need more and better. None says it makes all the problems go away as potus does. https://t.co/x6daEz2NEo
no trump design.  BOLLARD FENCING is what was being put up before trump. You make my point - the barriers are not a new idea. We need more, yes. But all involved - except potus and his followers like you - don’t think barriers are the key. They are only the key to a farce https://t.co/YmXSRLwYIg

Issues, yes. Plan? No. A wall was a gimmick with a fiction that Mexico would pay. It was never a plan. It was a trump con.  Now GOP should step away and work with dems on a plan because need is real and great and barriers are just a part https://t.co/xn4DP6XxXM

I don’t see the value in debating potus mental health. Or the Romney/potus bs. both have been highly hypocritical about the other.

“Border security” is now accepted GOP parlance. Wasn’t during trump public display with both sides. Was a big reason a deal wasn’t done. https://t.co/nJvl34iD8A
Or answer for it. Also notice how potus lawyer defines what matters. Carved out potus knowing about any bad meetings and contacts and knowledge of interference efforts AND obstruction. It is all about a pr war. Not legal points. https://t.co/tgfAG06K6M
She talking about potus? https://t.co/2c1gS3BNYY
Never had anyone in leadership from CBP say we are a wall away from a solution. Ever. And potus also has facts wrong about what father said, reportedly. But biggest point is that potus never owns responsibility for any problem. https://t.co/tdH0K8UQts
Potus lawyer weighing in, why? pr war: deflect and distract from mueller issues at all costs. Going at pelosi - who is not speaker - for vacay when potus has set a new standard for time away and has us in a shutdown of his own making only makes sense in this context. https://t.co/NyQJfEoPpN

My experience is deep and irrelevant. Literally a lifetime of exposure to the illness.  And no counselor asks people to go from coke to booze, etc. stepping down is about reducing amounts, combos, and habits. Even then it is risky and often unproductive. https://t.co/0H7gsZMGnI
Completely consistent. It is so hard to stop smoking that often the physical addiction to heroin can be less taxing. Sometimes. Again - we are dealing with deadly addictions. I would love to learn vaping is a safe passage away from any of it https://t.co/DbXKOHnIRK
That’s twitter. I know this for a fact, smoking will kill you. And quitting nicotine is very very hard. I just won’t be surprised when we learn there is a reason all these teens can’t stop vaping. Parents talk to me abt it all the time. See it in my own experience. https://t.co/hR5h7ODBDU
Less bad. Not safer. We don’t know it is safe. That’s the point. And stop assuming vaping is the cure for smoking. We don’t know that either. I know some who called to stop. I know more who now can’t stop vaping. https://t.co/TXOkAWqYP1
Many proponents argue exactly that: that it is harmless. And we are seeing more and more cases that suggest otherwise. And the idea of stepping down from one bad to a lesser bad - is not new. And not the best way to quit any drug. https://t.co/9TlXnrtCcv
Brava! So hard to do. Congrats. Don’t smoke today! https://t.co/HM4N6gTz9z
I don’t think so - except for small trump base. One piece of advice: ignoring any positive moves by admin does not enhance scrutiny of the same; it weakens your ability to argue the negatives. https://t.co/7BxI2EWpRQ
And it may be better than smoking...but we should all agree that is a poor standard. being a smoker sucks. Very hard to quit. But quitting is the only safe course. Heroin rehab often allows people to smoke because too hard to quit! https://t.co/IW4xHRLXJ9
You are exaggerating the known to cover the unknown. And you think shifting from smoking to something less bad justifies all. I don’t. Worried about kids and as an ex-smoker...quitting is the only safe path. https://t.co/8eH5pSbnNB

He could not follow the simple advice: keep it nice and about them. He can’t help but prevaricate for his own aggrandizement. Not even over there and with them.  Still - it is nice for the troops to feel special https://t.co/yd1M7J6ybU
Not sure shame works on potus. But maybe it will on you: calling positives and negatives as you see them is strength not weakness. The partisanship that forces you to ignore all that isn’t negative is toxic. Avoid that instinct. https://t.co/BqZoA2u5oC
Good move for potus - seeing troops in Iraq after Xmas. Yes, this potus has waited longest to do so, but he did it. And it means a lot to troops. Keep it positive and abt them - potus will get warranted positive coverage.

Potus says the Fed Is the problem. Investors talk about his trade threats, fiscally irresponsible tax cut and consistent poor messaging like this from him and his peeps https://t.co/Xyo09gyaTl
Guess that’s why he shuts his mouth and does little to stem the dysfunction all around him. https://t.co/WSXSy4HnXx
Gop set a standard for opposition- unprincipled and purely partisan. Undocumented workers are nowhere near the top threat to your safety, your job, or your future… https://t.co/mvh3hZRwmV

Trump handles his role as Commander-in-Chief very differently than any president in modern history.

Comey had to backtrack on what he testified to regarding Clinton. Lying is something that must be proven. Please, proceed ... https://t.co/skPUkcZJiL
And yet WH sticks with story that Flynn railroaded. Why? Why say LOI in Russia deal signed by Cohen or not signed by trump? We all reported trump signed it. I have a signed copy of it. By potus. #FactsFirst https://t.co/IRQbZUq1Q1
No lying to federal investigators? https://t.co/aVOJz09xiA
One letter. We all reported it. Potus and co seem to be trying to change the narrative - hence time to point out the fact. Doubt you have seen signed letter before now fwiw https://t.co/nNBHJ0z8Un
The final fact: seventeen. That's how many separate investigations of the President there are ...federal, state and local levels. Shout out to Garrett Graff from Wired for compiling the list, and here it is... https://t.co/MPNTy5veZF
There are at least 17 known investigations that involve Donald Trump... Think about that...it's almost instructive... The President waves all of them away as partisan attacks, but today he folded on one...  #CuomoPrimeTime #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/X608z3e94h
URGENT: Sanders on Flynn ambush comment: "We don’t have any reason to walk that back"  More bizarro theater. Flynn says no ambush in open court but WH sticks with bs. But sander right, they don’t have a reason...because they are only in the game of attacking institutions
And yet the case is civil. Maybe you were hit with a rock that made you confuse the facts ? https://t.co/D3PVNKBJfW

#FlynnSentencing Judge Sullivan making clear that any Flynn suggestion of wrongdoing by govt better have facts behind it. Quite a different standard for political attacks by potus and pals.
https://t.co/iIa8oHAdQf what changed from when govt decided bump stocks were just a part and not subject to regulation? They say they reviewed new developments? You mean 58 dead?

An attny general demanding that a sitting potus and his family not be allowed to sit on a board of a charity. There is no guidance for how to deal with the events surrounding this admin. We have never been here. https://t.co/ArEb2vSC3v
They called and asked and Flynn invited them. It was in him. As a general and intel expert he knew the rules and he clearly worked the situation.  And he admitted to doing the same and is being sentenced today.  Those are the facts. https://t.co/rqWh49imhm
But most mobsters are savage sociopaths. https://t.co/qn1tC2Fa5k
They just lie for effect. Period. This is all a political contest for them. They will attack any institution apparently if it serves Trump’s immediate interest. I usually say potus, but there is no legit interest in that office for this kind of bs https://t.co/O8nSvFVjsP
And now comes the “we did nothing wrong; this a witch-hunt” ? https://t.co/FNAM92zcjB
Interesting read. Credit potus with getting so called fiscal conservatives to shut up and swallow what he feeds them. Not ez to do with this group. https://t.co/6W36gUMJn4

There is no new wall; just more barriers where needed. That’s the fact. Now the issue: the price tag dems say it is artificially inflated to con voters into thinking trump delivered on an entirely new structure. So now what? #TickTock https://t.co/HMjSwuts3A

Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the Flynn Interview https://t.co/74goy0VCfA
The Republican controlled Senate Intel Committee just put out some third party research that provides our best evidence to date of what Russia was doing on social media to muck up our election. The clear goal: help Trump.  #LetsGetAfterIt #CuomoPrimeTime https://t.co/kwqTdumoGc
One is a legal scholar the other is counsel to potus.  The idea that they be silenced because you don’t like what they say...is a bad idea in this regard. Test their ideas, expose whatever is misleading...that’s what we are about at our best https://t.co/wkKj9h8pGZ
Where is that the standard? https://t.co/dzzferAdUL
This is all gibberish. They heard Flynn  lie. They thought about it - decided to ask him about it. And he lied about it. No contrivance necessary. And you can spin conspiracies as much as you like. Find the facts or find another fiction. https://t.co/uRxFq46Mk4
Was dershowitz - but solid analysis. “No investigative purpose” is not an ez standard to satisfy in this situation. Watch what we have on @ChrisCuomo  tonight. The questions are all real. The answers are unknown. https://t.co/okTuj428sh
Interesting. “Only to elicit” jaundiced assumption? knowing someone will lie does not influence the decision to do so. “Material” goes to what the lie is about - thoughts ? https://t.co/UWCbgL8vyM

Klobuchar/Brown - hey dems...sound like your best shot to beat potus? https://t.co/ODknVHp0mw

I am seeing that there are plenty of local efforts... but I wonder if a more scaled-up effort...that could up the deliverables...more expensive things...tech stuff that could really give kids and teens a leg up. https://t.co/TPZMSBuILN
Right? However if they are not deployed it matters same way. Don’t we owe them this? Why shouldn’t the rest of us chip in to make sure their kids are treated special?  the way we always say they are when we promise to support the troops?  (an often hollow phrase)  @PaulRieckhoff https://t.co/JBM8i0ZX4P
Politics are not part of this. Why can’t troops’ kids write notes not just to Santa but to the “Grateful Nation”? An organization could easily monitor what was requested and follow through. Will research what exists like this but who wouldn’t donate to that fund? @PaulRieckhoff https://t.co/GvJeSHL7jL

Brother - for the left, almost all on the right should not be allowed to voice what they think - even if key players or electeds. For the right, most of you are trying to bring down a president without cause. Open minds are in short supply. I get it. But I believe in testing. https://t.co/TyqK5F1MBH
Even their best can’t fight the truth: potus lied about Cohen and the payments. Lied about Russia ties. Why? https://t.co/xYk9Dl81Xr
He doesn’t have to direct to be legally exposed and he doesn’t have to direct to lie about it, which potus did. KAC is clever but the WH is trying to deflect and attack those who test them. That’s what comes shining through in all this. The lying is the loser for them https://t.co/vnoXOsY5Jy
The legal standard is right, of course, Mariotti is a pro...but the lying is clear. Why did potus lie? And if lies like this on a number of issues relevant to investigators what will that mean to country and to political accountability? https://t.co/EaQX9I6r8J
Round 2 https://t.co/hCj7T7nXJ8
President Nixon wound up foretelling his own fall when he said on tape "it is not the crime...it is the cover up that gets you." Lying to insulate yourself can be a trap. And that's what this President faces now. https://t.co/Aw2U1LbdGB
The more people go down for lying the less others are likely to keep up a lie. And if the President continues to lie as a first response, the more those lies impact a federal investigation, the higher the price he may have to pay. https://t.co/zv6AjJ0c5n

We all know the threat is real. This is not just a job, it is a calling - people do it because they believe it...maybe now more than ever https://t.co/w4MRjJ50yp

This is a common refrain but if the general decides to go another way, wonder if trump will look to his caddy or some other familiar face. Personal pilot for FAA, personal doctor for VA, personal morning show anchor for UN, why not?
Everyone evac’d and is reported fine. Have to put safety first. Thanks for all the well-wishing, but even more so for not making stupid jokes empowering such a threat. People will re-enter ASAP. Onward. https://t.co/Lrm3TmFjuT

Both takes have merit; it is a matter of opinion. Don is right that there is plenty of good reason for the Obamas to blow trump off. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t make the right choice by addressing him https://t.co/4WnHoXMpjR

Lack of design is the issue. Potus seems to see migrants as something to exploit politically in the main - and we have seen little expression of the “love” he promised. https://t.co/nwGnlEAYwy

The blame is for the reality and lack of readiness: we never saw this volume amassing before - and yet no plan. So as a result you have desperate people in combustible situation with trump rhetoric making it worse. Trump said treat the rocks as rifles. https://t.co/n9YGHuUnkr
No such thing. Some are saying it was pepper spray not tear gas. We are checking on that but even if it were, pepper spray is very difficult for adults let alone kids. https://t.co/7SqmJbbRLz
That is clearly untrue. You are missing a lot - most central, the push to get xparency and accountability for this assault on the migrants and to see how govt can avoid it happening again https://t.co/oz1OOw3NFi
So true - and seeing kids exposed is terrible...i have seen it here and abroad. but as Democrat Rep.

Don’t be a sucker. GM already did what it is going to do in Ohio. There is zero indication that this is part of a car swap. It is about maximizing bottom line.  Potus starts with a suggestion and then pretends his wish is a fact #dbas  watch and see: https://t.co/rBcN0cjSO4
For those who keep saying it is wrong to accuse potus of burying report and for denying climate science: YOU are wrong. Proof: https://t.co/WirXZ77brO
Odds are yes - especially with potus pushing for her in a ruby red state. Wonder how all those GOP’ers in the suburbs feel about him pulling for another candidate who cottons to bigotry? https://t.co/C3fjl7hUoQ
Question is was there an order or was this reaction. Working on answers. Asylum laws are also party of intl protection and potus seems to think he can just change them himself. He can’t. https://t.co/ZcjGdccv9Z
Why isn’t the country more focused on what’s happening? Media covering it. Twitter is only one metric - and a toxic one at that...but Alec Baldwin court appearance getting more traffic than #SanYsidro https://t.co/TqZFvH03W2
#MigrantCaravan #SanYsidro - not even close to trending...but they should be. Potus is off on facts. He is ignoring the problems there and at same time seems to think the problems help him. Will dems become more vocal? https://t.co/Pj1DJhln0o
He could just ask for more judges. Potus hasn’t even done that. Does he want it to be chaotic? https://t.co/YiibI6XLST
60 did not do a phony story. Potus admitted he wanted to send a message of harshness. HLS was treating kids in a way they did not have to. Bush and Obama (and Reagan and Clinton, etc) never did that because they were not trying to create a brown bogeyman. https://t.co/KgY5GrsBHR
True. But scenes like today feed the fear of migrants and fear of those enforcing the law. Why isn’t potus talking about his plan if he believes there is an invasion to thwart? https://t.co/h63mnJarxI
They are not bots. That’s the challenge. People are so far apart when their interests are so often pretty closely aligned. Here, all want the law enforced and more judges and staff and accommodations would do that better and faster https://t.co/IkWHxc4y61
Who says? And even if that’s true - even if a third are kids and their moms...that’s thousands and abusing one is too many. You can enforce the law and be decent. https://t.co/RKSq283BE1
Well- pols make it hard. But calling for staff and judges and a better process is very do-able. If potus is invasion-conscious, why not improve the system to help? (Assuming he wants to see a solution and not more chaos) https://t.co/Hxm2wTjh0e
Migrants are not breaking the law by coming for asylum. That is what the law allows. More judges would help. Ask for that. Being decent to migrants is not weakness https://t.co/P1TCIzZqlf
It was crowd control. Not an invasion. Look - I see your side demonizing the migrants, and those who oppose your position, are outraged and equally passionate to see brutality called out and stopped...but what matters most is leaders figuring out how to control the flow https://t.co/SWuXpeqx6s
My reaction? It is sickening to see kids in that turmoil. My job is to work sources to find out what happened and why and to expose what I can show and to plan going there to have eyes on any conflicts in real time. https://t.co/7SOYxOOLvT
That’s what we are working on now. And the 39 arrested in connection with the event. And the truth behind the 500 arrested by Mexican authorities. https://t.co/UFmegkNwkF
And you have to know who did it and hold them to account. My point is just to say that all of CBP is not to blame. Find the facts of who did what and go from there. That’s what we are doing https://t.co/CCyaSF00X6
Or not. Why not just expand the process...more judges, more accommodations, more staff...to process humanely and effectively. This is not a hard fix. https://t.co/TaUNGccIQ0
We will survive - but how we come through this is the issue: we can’t expect to process large numbers of people in ways that force families apart and create chaos. We can do better https://t.co/Ree7sdVhGf
That’s never true.  All duty requires discretion. Especially in these situations. https://t.co/PzpAShMol3
Fact-less https://t.co/VHk8rhQTtG
I keep hearing from people who know potus that they are not sure he will run. Find that hard to believe https://t.co/wXWuHowBNN
Voting is always the answer. But I would be slow to put so much pressure on mueller report (assuming acting AG or whomever is in power then let’s us see it. Mandate is to only deliver to AG, but don’t see how they can not disclose to public in some form). https://t.co/VaxVToSoFQ
Not about cleaning up. I see opportunity for politicians who find answers to this and other issues. Millions just delivered a mandate for oversight and accountability and better from govt. https://t.co/yig2q76mRz
That didn’t work https://t.co/5mcwXyXxgp
If it is true that the majority of Americans want to see migrants treated with respect and for their to be reform of the system, leaders would be placating by doing something about it. https://t.co/7a5dyq30i7
All true. But you also know it didn’t get done and the prospects for comprehensive reform are unclear - and while potus owns the greatest responsibility, i have not heard lawmakers pushing for answers here. Maybe after today they will. https://t.co/Lf4KGzVQ8N
Of course not but where did you guys get the idea that false reports are the norm? Do the research, happens but usually someone who decides to leave all they know and love and make a desperate journey are not faking. https://t.co/LupejK0Rp0
But the system matters too. Congress said it wants to reclaim oversight, dems specifically, do we have plan for migrants congregating bear border that respects them and is efficient? No word of same from potus or admin https://t.co/tswmexZHgJ
Propagandist and mendacity often go hand in hand. Real concern: we witnessed cruelty towards children and adults on border by govt, I hope people don’t pay less attention if it happens again. Compassion must not fatigue https://t.co/6ngfmmwe1p

Strong point. Word sounds great, but means something terrible. Can’t believe it is relevant in this country in this day and age...actually, yes, yes I can believe it https://t.co/8ZxG30jKAK
Whatever word - it was decisive and related to his negativity and constant attempts to divide. Potus even basically admitted he is not trying to unite the country right now. https://t.co/aURSrc8JLR
never an excuse for inhumanity. My concern:  I see more of this coming if there are not solutions to help all these people in a faster and humane way. And potus may point to that as proof of his invader pitch when his rhetoric and lack of plan helps create the problem https://t.co/g4SaQzQ48T
I have never - personally - seen gas being used by troops/cops because gas was used on police/troops first. I have seen it to deter riots and violence toward cops. https://t.co/vpjyeEd79K
Agree 100%. https://t.co/m5k8HWxSig
Agree 100%. We need to test power in #SanYsidro (and wherever migrants come together) and demand transparency. Media will have to be there. And you must see what happens and be informed. And govt has to create solutions. https://t.co/v162sUlSju
Remember the polls during Crimea “annexation”? Do Americans want to be involved? Is that the only metric that matters? Tough situation for potus especially with all the Putin posturing https://t.co/MZrH48Zbyk
Let’s say you are right. And again, that would be a sad commentary on a nation of immigrants - and no matter what potus says, that’s what we are. We are still left in the same place. How do we fix what is going on to respect the people and the need for a process? https://t.co/xS6Btrojjc
Here is the main problem: even if everyone was acting with the best of intentions (and potus makes clear that is not the case), we don’t have a set up to process these numbers with respect for humanity and law. https://t.co/DrK8NhRmzX
Facts are facts. The politics are as obvious as the predicament: can’t leave the situation as is...can’t have thousands coming here and no system to accommodate. We have to be able to do better.  We can have respect for migrants and law. https://t.co/KBwl6rRHGb
I don’t believe this country hates immigrants. So many - like me - are a couple generations in or less.  Potus pitching antipathy for migrants was rejected widely in midterms. Remember that https://t.co/6VPektPM5G
Problem is system wasn’t working then or now where mass movements are involved. Call out the ugly lies, hold officials to account for methods, but the main problem has to be addressed - by congress and potus. If Tijuana becomes a staging ground for thousands, we need answers https://t.co/cS9jrjdtLo
Agreed - and when I see proof of the same I go after it - enough to be a  constant target for potus and his loyalists, right? I get your point - I just think the emphasis should be fixing what is happening. We can’t have gassings and altercations like this. What is the solution? https://t.co/xkPrpE1LnG
Mass migration happened and holding kids who came alone happened but the stated objectives of being cruel as a deterrent? Casting all migrants as invaders who are coming to rob and kill? This is all a signature of this potus. Own that. https://t.co/Qvgechsh89
Oh yes he did. Bragging abt 2 senate seats? should have gotten 5 with this map. You lost 7 govs and house, in part, because potus jingoistic fire-breathing and lying was rejected across the country. https://t.co/i8PFd1kM9r
This is a good watch. It was a policy, not something they were forced into. https://t.co/313cpI1bOn
Don’t know where you get the number - but there were far too many ok with doing what was done. And we exposed it for the irrational harshness it was.  And potus got whupped in midterms peddling his migrant mendacity https://t.co/7cnFrMSSbu
Not bickering. Discussing. Not everything has to be toxic. And who said equal blame? You can play that game I see a bad reality coming and my job is to test power - on both sides - to see what they will do about it. https://t.co/eQhkyC4213
government should be able to handle this. You are making a generous offer- usually it is “hey Cuomo why don’t you take them in” - which is the exact jaundice potus bet on and lost in midterms.  Problem is potus was bs abt invasion but he didn’t fix or plan and now it may get ugly https://t.co/anehcfnbQ0
You are right about potus - at least as far as he has showed us to date. But spreading his feelings to all in govt is unfair. I spoke tonight to people involved and they care, they act out of pathos as much as out of a duty protect https://t.co/7Gs4LKlObL
And they wouldn’t let us see at first. And lied about it. And then HLS Secy there was no separation policy and we showed that wasn’t true and showed documents suggesting as much. We have been all over this and with good reason. And the worst may be yet to come. https://t.co/2aHkgevJ0w
I have seen lots of people, kids, elderly gassed. I have been gassed. It sucks. The situation sucks but the point is to not demonize the men and women in duty without cause and to address the problems that lead to them facing this overwhelming group of people who deserve help https://t.co/oz1OOw3NFi
I covered that fight closely; it was too big to pass. Rubio was right: immigration needs to be done in pieces. Gop can’t complain about a migrant issue and claim to be abt law and order and then not address the problems w/ the law and the order - without paying yet another price https://t.co/03tRtoSRPD
Streamline? Asylum is a process and an important one.  System can’t handle flow. There are legal and logistical obstacles that have to be addressed. Dems in house can try and if nothing else expose potus and co desire to do nothing productive - if that’s the case https://t.co/tRPkzhjuPN
I said no such thing. And you know it. They needed to simplify the fixes and they stuck to a grand gesture and got nothing done. That’s the reality. Dems have power and a chance to help. Isn’t that why they wanted power? Your left right handwringing is tired, pal. https://t.co/0rfzmusOC0
spoke to several who say potus abandoned deal w/ dems. He caved to party xenophobia aka “hardline”. For all his bluster about invasion he has not tried to do a deal since. Potus wanted people to vote out of fear. Maybe he thinks doing nothing will make him right abt problems? https://t.co/qXpnT3alpX
This is all nonsense. Are you just a flamethrower? You really think comprehensive reform has a chance or just sounds good? They need to deal with this issue (migrant mass movement). Now. https://t.co/4sFY7Vvdvq
And we wonder why nothing gets better. Political feelings aside,  I have been with CBP folks along the border. Plenty. And I know many are latino and  I have seen compassion in their treatment of migrants. Actually did a doc on it. Check HLN On Demand: Inside with (me) https://t.co/qxzJ6Cabhc
Trump is in power, calls shots with CBP/HLS. been a constant agent for jingoism/bigotry toward migrants. Period. That said, dems have power and w/ that comes responsibility. Will this be a top priority? However, the situation may come to head before Jan https://t.co/Fw7hvnvnwr
That’s what you want to put out there. Fine. My job is to test those in power and to show the situation for what it is. And expose the problems. And there are many. And it may soon be worse. Don’t get why dems don’t front load this as a priority. Why give this issue to trump? https://t.co/i9Vd6NYiuo
It could certainly be both. Facts: The system can’t handle the flow; doesn’t accommodate the realities of who is coming and how and why. We are not a wall away. There could be 10k in TJ soon. Where is congress and this WH working on ways to help? https://t.co/sk3JO5f1If
The question is why Congress and the WH apparently didn’t even make an effort. An EO ending asylum? Legally and politically foolish. DHS and CBP are doing their jobs but the system has flaws that compromise those protecting the border and those seeking a better life. https://t.co/cWQJMKlG6U
Ignore? Ww cover potus and co lies  on immigration regularly. And I - unlike you - don’t see the need to exaggerate the already toxic hostility. I am pushing leaders for ideas for progress not platitudes. And if Tijuana gets as bad as they expect, we will be there. https://t.co/NcemJYjJ1N
Tim is my man and a mentor - i am pointing out the reality: trimp backs people with questionable sympathies and connections to bigots. He just does. https://t.co/J6y1YkvoX6
No one wants to see migrants treated poorly. That’s why there is so much media presence. But your analysis is not in line with the reporting about what is happening. And this may be inevitable when you have a large group being handled in current system. Something has to change https://t.co/0Z7PIbWKfW
Key question: what happened before these actions by authorities? Reporting seems pretty clear that Mexican nor CBP border security initiated action. We have to be fair to situation on the ground and hope you and your colleagues actually make the system work better. ASAP. https://t.co/aDkb7dQYRT
Fringe conversation is one thing but would pelosi and dem leadership really allow this notion to get traction in the caucus? Seems to be great way to own all the problems on the border coming soon. https://t.co/VeAXnlrpRB

This was not just about CNN.

A big reason why the wave was washed out for some were some bold face names losing, names that carried hopes for radical change in places normally out of Democrat's reach: Beto was bettered in Texas; Abrams seems out of in Georgia, and then there is Florida. #CuomoPrimeTime https://t.co/CvHautM1lQ
Rallies of thousands are not reflective of the will of the majority. As we just saw in midterms. Trump could have arguably gained seats based on economic spin and lack of cohesive counter message - but he can’t even get to 50% in the polls. Imagine if there were a recession... https://t.co/t3zbf2AGoU

Obama got shellacked. Also had cultural backlash and economic desperation.  Trump should be like bush after 9/11...who gained seats, instead he divides and thus even the economy could not save him from himself. Spin as you like. The numbers are facts. https://t.co/gpqcgcfPig

Two problems: he is wrong on the facts. And this is the first line of the 14A. A president can’t change the constitution.  And FYI - The legislative history makes clear they included it to secure it from congress or scotus interpretation. So much for respecting constitution https://t.co/8m6qOxjh29

The man is president. We only have one. He must lead and he held to account for the same. Still not one single thought about how we can unify and how he will make the change. Not one. https://t.co/oaAVA04Piq
Why does a tea party republican cotton to these types? Asked to come on to explain...invite stanss https://t.co/IMGF7Z3rF6
Demonstrably false. Look at the rallies and statements after the bombings and the biggest mass murder of Jews in America and you see lip service to unity and massive intent on division. And she knows it. https://t.co/EMIx559WuY
And the base says “who cares”... and 54% of the country says he is “who we thought he was” https://t.co/VML5wbwbfQ
The left is not blameless but that doesn’t make anything equal. Potus is at top of food chain and is driving a hate train. https://t.co/3FZ6GrolC4
Is he a wordsmith? No. Is he a regular guy? No. And plenty of them know not to bait haters. The quote abt migrants makes clear potus wants you to think migrants in the main present problems for us. https://t.co/oZYVz1FCja
This guy is becoming the norm there - someone expected to know better who parrots as much xenophobia as he can remember https://t.co/aFlOe1Z4Y2
Another jingoist from an attack site. Jews are fake if they don’t accept potus “enemy” talk? https://t.co/tvKye6DbCa
Key part is around 1:45. Divisive talk is not new. Yes the media today is more active in calling out. And with good reason. https://t.co/aVGMfx7vWF
Are the Jewish leaders now the enemy too? https://t.co/AOyjnioa6b
So unity means trump gets praise. Come on! Somebody in power speak some truth to potus. https://t.co/uVR3iYeG5v
Stop being surprised that potus shirks responsibility for his actions and words. He has never owned mistakes. He has never promised to change. Only when all those around him insisted he do so (access Hollywood tape) did he even own something he said was wrong. https://t.co/zK4gMMElX7
Media is supposed to expose bs propaganda, not be a part of the same. https://t.co/QHXwLwgQgC
but not fair coverage. Just praise. We should ignore his talking more abt how bad his opponents are than abt how he will unite the country - even on the day of the shooting. Respect the dead by taking about them, and how you will honor their loss by being better https://t.co/t0ZnDTZTUV
Good for him. Fox has to stop being a safe haven for trump folk looking to duck accountability. The secy has consistently distorted the policy and reality. Wallace was a mentor of mine at abc and he is a standout, especially there. https://t.co/qF3ItJQTqg

I don’t need to insult to feel justified in my reporting or argumentation, true - but saying trump is incapable is simply not true. He chooses to be the way he is https://t.co/UgifDCUeBG
He is capable - he is not willing. Trump thinks this is how he wins. But why doesn’t he see that over half the country disagrees ? https://t.co/6rkXmNXg7w
Only one to own the poison ploy, FYI. Not sure if he outsmarted himself or gave in to what the Fox audience wanted to hear instead of being smart in his analysis https://t.co/XCwI1gAGIe

This is not 9/11 or anything remotely like it - who suggested anything else? Point: All devices could be useless. But bombs targeting your targets is scary. For real. This gave leaders a chance to own their part in a toxic dialogue. You did the opposite. https://t.co/ClCyqGO8DV

It's a moment that's given some pause to consider what the hell we're doing to ourselves for political gain...but the President seems to see it as a time to double down on divisiveness, refuse to own any responsibility and blame the media, which was just targeted by a bomb. https://t.co/RuKw7fi0E0
She keeps on using that word. “Presidential”. I do not think it means what she thinks it means https://t.co/Z6X0Oa74Ow
He knows this untrue. https://t.co/6YE6AcWgZ8
Unless he is talking about his patsies posing as press - this is more proof potus is not concerned about the bombs. And still no mention of the former presidents - no respect or recognition...no leadership https://t.co/WvXs0ymmPi

Don’t be small. Not funny, not masculine, not needed. Be better. https://t.co/e27xL01hDB
I was wrong. Trump decided to absent himself from any scrutiny and blame the media (that was sent a bomb) along with his other favorite targets. calls on others to change - not himself. Makes sense: trump once said he’s never done anything that required God’s forgiveness https://t.co/uILBqyNMbX
It was a suspicious pkg but not a bomb. Not related. Thank you. https://t.co/aFxPjPzEWt

Surprising if trump squashes the anti-media, “i am a nationalist”, opponents are enemies bs tonight? No. Arguably foolish not to. But what about tomorrow and next week? That the test of his resolve.

I am ok if you don’t watch, just don’t send bombs. Let’s start there. https://t.co/bBuvy9bCqL
If the evidence suggests this was done to advance a political agenda it will be designated a terror attack. That’s the legal definition. If it is a white guy from here or a Moroccan from there - is irrelevant https://t.co/dBmDpMzyJO
If anything this should be a beginning.  If this is a domestic terror threat when will we say enough with the empty negativity? https://t.co/vH0avPRMfo

Thank you for all the kindness directed at @CNN and for the concern about my brother. The gov did not get targeted as far as anyone knows. That was a false report. Your reax show there is much more that unites than divides. Even now - especially now.
I don’t want you to agree all the time - but you should want to listen and think and stay open. Your political opponents are not enemies. The trick is how we get better. That will be a bottom-up effort I suspect https://t.co/BQCZ7Yn4YM
We clearly have a problem. We clearly need to think less about division and toxic attacks and more about how we come together. That isn’t saccharine - it is fact at this point https://t.co/8nJgHtiLHz
My own fan-version-of-me is against me https://t.co/x0KA8TQDw3
Did he send the bombs? People need to own their own shite and to realize that we each make a choice to help or hurt the dynamic. My job is to call out bs from potus and moreover to inform you of the truth. Truth is the problem is bigger than him https://t.co/XnSlG7eDJf
That is a useless point: they have to deal with what is coming and a status quo that is not acceptable. “Can’t” is not an option. Election in two weeks - let’s hear candidates say they can’t do anything. Trump lying abt problem has been exposed - time for him to do better https://t.co/X5K0zqDliO
As my thread explodes I encourage you to call 866-967-6887 from 12-2p Eastern. My sxm show today will be about the bombs and what to do about the political climate
My point is the negativity is toxic. It is getting us nowhere. Look at caravan - all this bitching and lying but who is planning for if/when a group of any size shows up? How do we police/process? Dems? Gop? Trump? https://t.co/zbBuhMHXFi
That’s bs. As a guy who works where this was sent, who receives all kinds of threats that would keep you under your covers - I am looking for better, not merely blame. Blame gets us nowhere. Clearly. How do you make it better? https://t.co/BGCb2Z5ro1
No one says open borders. No one. The issue is HOW we enforce the laws. So don’t cheapen the problem. Do you tear kids away? Trump says yes. How do you deal with mass migrants? Does trump have a plan other than military? Are we ok with that scenario? https://t.co/1VRYFJAsF5
Leadership. And yes, it should have been Trump who sent this https://t.co/1oKHQlRqoa

Kushner: we will determine which facts are credible re Saudi. Probably misspoke but given trump penchant for mendacity worth reminding: ALL FACTS ARE CREDIBLE. that’s why they are facts
Wow - you see being bigoted as the righty response to lefty politics? That’s messed up. Let me help you: being a bigot is not ok. It is not a legit political position. It is a malfunction. https://t.co/xBHhrZbx3Q
Sound foolish. What do you think she did to him to warrant a bigoted response? https://t.co/4biWrj0ez3

He doesn’t know the position or the science so the joke will be lost on him. Carlin is missed. https://t.co/1DdiSY2i2O
@PauPaulbuccello Like a bad case of stupid. Seems incurable. Only the weakest of your ilk would try to paint someone this way for political points. Have some shame.
Depends on what your hopes are :) My job is to tell you how it is...some people only hear how they want it to be. That’s ok. Record is clear. And who knows what will happen. Plenty of surprises to this point https://t.co/oeZPMvhvLr
100% - truth leads and no favorites, though no suggestion they are in a fix at this point.  Poor choices? Yup. Poor ethics and intentions? Probable. Crimes? Doubtful. Enough to impeach based on what trump knew/did? unclear at best as of now https://t.co/3ahcSbcLv1
There is no quota - no right number. If people ask for asylum, process and follow law. Period. If you don’t want any migrants at all (which many like you seem not to) - then make that the law and policy (would be anathema to our history but can be done) https://t.co/2zs651Q5GN
Record is clear. Go back and check. There are real questions and issues of concern but the outcomes have always been necessarily limited in potential. I have written reported and relayed this...many times. https://t.co/63vqLTeiZW
Not at all. Should never be about a desired outcome...just what we can learn abt how and who and what can be done to keep it from happening again. https://t.co/BOq0p0mITA

Reason mueller probe has been quiet reportedly is to allow elex to proceed.  But when it comes out, it will be a partisan spin cycle. https://t.co/lycyUFWK9y
I have no deeper info on what Mueller has but for some time we have cautioned that this probe matters to get facts about how Russia worked our election and see if anyone helped them and those pushing a trump knockout are setting u up  https://t.co/LU3lzpDvDi via @politico

Trump seems to see saudi cover story for what it is - but doesn’t seem to think worst fears about Kashoggi murder warrant disturbing commerce. https://t.co/yXY2xCHx7E
A good read https://t.co/yXY2xCHx7E
the point is simply that violence must be called out and we can’t cater to bullies. I use my mind, my heart and my mouth. Not my hands. But I won’t be intimidated into not testing power. Touching is wrong - and opens up those who do it to being wronged https://t.co/uRkJv950jC
This guy is a pos. this race to the bottom you are in is a losing effort. There are a lot of angry people and many are poor examples of political thinking. Why are you making them the standard? When you call out potus for playing their game, let me know https://t.co/KUCxEfnNYo
You are dead wrong that all accounted with Lowe followers are bots. I have seen the metrics. I reply to those who represent a significant body of opinion.  Don’t be a snob https://t.co/Bm5TToRV4z

Ur a “Proud Christian”? No wonder pride is a deadly sin. Think Jesus would call migrants “illegals”? You know your faith as well as you do facts and science. Hope you are better as a counselor than a critic. https://t.co/2eAa3l9qrh
Because I don’t encourage gratuitous violence. Because the rock knows he has nothing to fear from a bully and thus no need to use force. That’s true power. https://t.co/YLlTa9GudF
Did it come out because of being hit or despite it? Research overwhelmingly supports the latter. Anyone who knows me would tell you I am strict...but I have learned the error of hitting. https://t.co/WcpW1KW71O
Because she is a leader of a powerful group and is a key surrogate for trump and she is therefore perfect to test the soundness of his positions https://t.co/1sT2wJP3Tr

To you. But he has said illegal entry must be curtailed and the legal process needs work. If you don’t think compassion needs to be part of it you have forgotten your family’s experience as well as you duty of fairness as a supposed journalism teacher https://t.co/n8PVeBEsiQ
You quoted something that is not a quote. And made an argument I find offensive. Your father’s stance was brave. My pop was told he was less than for much of his life because of his name and ethnicity and social economic status. That’s offensive too. Don’t be offended, be better https://t.co/pqqXWZOUhY
Are any people with open minds buying this bs? Who says we should not have borders or vetting or standards? Trump is making choices about what kinds of people get to come - legally - that’s why this is a cultural question not just security https://t.co/3UN6oEceuZ
Watch more. Tweet less. You sound foolish. https://t.co/4hfnMFEv68

I don’t hate anyone. And any designation on basis of color or creed is unAmerican.  Diversity is strength - this you don’t dismiss any aspect of that diversity, right? Fatal flaw of #MAGA : ask when things were better than now. Answer always exposes period of less equality https://t.co/uenINnKUNy
What is offensive is your illogic. I point out that white male aspect because it evidences the xenophobia at play. Your people and mine came when the burden was getting here. There was no secondary selection process of worth. And they because the people who built this place. https://t.co/khLCldggth
Find me a major politician arguing for no borders and unchecked entry to the us. https://t.co/IHfslWDpOX
Who doesn’t think this? Who says let in bad peoples who will do nothing? I am just second generation. My people came with one asset: desire. They were spoken about as you speak now. You should know this. https://t.co/DKtZ5EEo24
Neither of us knows that. You heard it. You want it to be true. But you don’t know that. And who says let all of any group in? Point is not to say all of any group is automatically kept out. Make sense? https://t.co/cJsLbvvuun
I respect your service but I completely disrespect that nonsense. Look at the job openings and you see why there is a need for the exact labor that often comes from abroad. https://t.co/u0JlBIcMof
Proper counter: facts to offset false feeling. They probably read a bs riff from a righty rag and accepted it as fact. You didn’t insults - you offered info as insight that countered.  Well done. More please. https://t.co/AcrIbBqPgQ

Small thoughts from a small man with small legs - but he is also damnably correct #truthhurts https://t.co/ielQBaKkLR

Odd - this tweet comes from a white male. Trump wants LEGAL immigration greatly curtailed to avoid the same kinds of people that built this country. Even though we have a labor shortage. Wonder why? Ask all those Latino GOP’ers. https://t.co/aUQA1nv9ML
Good Book says a lot about how to treat the poor and displaced too. https://t.co/omPAmSvOWq
Why be shocked? I don’t think revelatory works here on any level. Arguably what her party responds to best from trump is his ham-fisted efforts to paint harshness as strength. https://t.co/LuAPENwDQq
Trump covets strength and is all about talking tough, that is, until he is dealing with someone who is actually tough - then he is measured and meek https://t.co/ZxHGPjG6KC
I'm going to leave these images playing in the wall because,remember, these are real people. Instead of seeing them as Trump wants you to, as monsters on the march, see them as they are:desperate, leaving behind whatever they had, whomever they knew..for a chance at a better life https://t.co/FEO5udZXSe

No question Antifa thugs - or thugs who claim the Antifa name are causing crime and poison decency.  But how can that be an excuse for sheltering racists from scrutiny? https://t.co/Hz0rMbq2kS

This is nyc. Antifa has a bunch of thugs that commit crimes in their name. That’s wrong. and it does not make these bigots less repugnant. Don’t run from this. Both are bad but it doesn’t excuse this. https://t.co/HMnoa1OFvs
Even with a General he calls a good man - and one with a record of service that rises to top of current admin - trump STILL must push us and them... calls him a Democrat like it was about vampires bs werewolves. Where does this get us? https://t.co/NZLmRTUZGC
More proof that it was never a mistake. All their denials, trump, WH, Nielsen - hogwash. Policy was intentional and about harshness and they want to continue it. https://t.co/2dcWWE5dyL

You see this is not about disrespecting political perspective - it is about exposing those who think simply being “anti” is a legit perspective https://t.co/FEIwfBks0K

@IIIPIIA Your vulgarity diminishes your point but first of all we have seen baseless allegations given a lot of attn and second you still haven’t articulate what standard should trigger consequence and how much of a show is required by either side. That’s the problem.
That does nothing to articulate a standard and relative responsibilities in the context of an allegation. https://t.co/SIy2ZiH4PO
headline is a good example of misleading media. My point: outside courtroom we don’t know what the burden of proof is and how much falls on the accused and the accuser. To say “presumption of innocence and it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt” OUTSIDE trial is nonsensical

The idea that anonymous sources can’t be used or trusted is nonsense. And trump clearly doesn’t believe that himself. He just says it out of convenience. Like many things he says. https://t.co/o258SpTR4v
Wrong. I am saying it assumes intel still offers such info to a president that clear disregards info and disrespects the source AND it assumes trump does homework and pays attn to something other than having his apple shined on tv https://t.co/wmS2e88xnA

Important for 2 reasons: shows that an allegation is often not enough to make a case; and this part of a story that ends this way - the allegation not holding up - is often not given attention.  It all matters: hear, respect, vet, resolve. Much tougher to touch all outside court https://t.co/EV1RP7Q2FJ

I would fight. That’s not the point.  How you fight matters. And shows what u r about.  K is being considered for a position that must be free of political animus. Each senator must judge if K showed the temperment scotus requires. https://t.co/Uq62NrdLv3
deleting this. I am all about engagement and disagreement - but I am not about adding to ha politics and using victims as fodder. Ford was victimized again - by politics. I won’t add to that. I have no fight with Mika or anyone. We must be united on respecting victims https://t.co/1KFwLZkQUw
Anyone looking at this fairly will see what is going on and that my asking for fairness to victims is not the problem. I will deal with the controversy between right and left on this - which I think is totally manufactured and unproductive on SiriusXM 124 at noon. 866-967-6887 https://t.co/jy2dP9CuqB
He has the right - but it really is not right. Even his yes men had to say it was wrong. It is far worse that that but for them that is a big step! Again - problem is Ford became a piece in an ugly political chess match. https://t.co/EdYmhYL5oJ
I didn’t watch. But I see what went on and I get the point abt the egg for @Mika. I said the same last night.  I don’t get why left and right are making this political. It is not. It is about how we treat the reality of people being hurt and then silenced https://t.co/RsQTCfMAyj
This is exactly right. I have now reviewed all the reax to @Mika - wasn’t aware of it when I tweeted. This seems really unproductive. Ford was trying to do the right thing in a bad place at a bad time. This is all abt getting K thru, not the truth of her story https://t.co/Mk4QSDzt0p
I just watched and read. Again. I get why there is a controversy that has. I thing to do with me.  I was just making a point of fairness, not looking to insult - clearly. We all want to see victims respected and heard. Let’s focus on that https://t.co/lcohTgIGJy
Mika - I am trying to contact you to discuss. I read the piece and then tweeted. You should know my intention is not to offend you or anyone - but just to raise a question of fairness. https://t.co/TLzkzDUATT

I think WH still has to ask fbi. Any hands Trump says no? https://t.co/3ApMYgeFYG
Flake said they deal was to push a bill on floor for extension and that was a basis for his voting in committee. Had he not it would have been 11-10 NO on K. Got it now? https://t.co/UWYlZujB8c
By lying about his drinking habits? Would that be enough for senators to sing him? https://t.co/UQXO3j2zdG
You are assuming no other R will vote no if no extension. https://t.co/MUWZnrKshU
You are painting with partisan brush. We need less of that They will vote on a bill and flake is using his vote as leverage. I am told he is not the only R who is in favor of this extension. https://t.co/TtWPmkBnEN
Why tweet when you can talk? SiriusXM 124 12-2. Call 866-967-6887 and make your case in my face :)
Wonder if will puff up abt them today? https://t.co/nQPLbFkxq5
Eloquent – but both can’t be telling the truth. And in a divided society… A most dangerous proposition: it is time to take sides on this matter. Both can’t be right https://t.co/HFf2jArfdZ
Anyone who sees Gotti as a model of anything positive… https://t.co/wkGYmqUZmG
From his perspective – his entire life is being trashed on the basis of something that he doesn’t believe they understand. I see both sides… The problem is this process was never going to clarify anything. We have a bunch of judges up there who all want a specific pitcome https://t.co/okAzKpIGOW
Would Trump with a majority vote in senate on his credibility or questions of his character? https://t.co/Ld6i02Mull
Another problem with this process - what is the chance K doesn’t hold a grudge on court, doesn’t favor trump ? Almost to much to ask for him to be fair when he is clearly hateful of Dems and totally aligned with trump and right. https://t.co/zY1fsm9FiN
But if he is rewarded at the end of this with a SCOTUS seat, his standing will be much better than it has ever been or would have been https://t.co/Qhyt0d5WAw
Better than with Leahy abt Bart O Kavanaugh. When you refuse to admit anything you expose yourself to speculation about everything. https://t.co/vdFWVkzdQZ
Very trumpy: deny all. https://t.co/8xA79bLtcN
By decency does she mean “says what we want said”? https://t.co/jtdQH1d0aU
Credit him with coming on when he knew he would be tested. Rare these days https://t.co/7p0FteBFaF
Ironic that this tweet sounds stupid. https://t.co/xN0HjXqCuo
Again, does k benefit from Trump being his advocate in a claim of being abusive to women ? https://t.co/FMTCjPeT6l
And too many are rooting for him and her like sports teams. Someone is lying here or really wrong.  Putting a question like this to a vote by self interested pols is a mistake. His emotion, her emotion - and someone’s feelings about them - that’s not the same as truth. https://t.co/kJsJTvJVTW
I am no scientist but having tried smoking and vaping...I can’t believe vaping wont some day be found to be toxic https://t.co/8NrlSs8ttG
This man loves to scrap https://t.co/ecmPVeqtN7
Hear that -  but also that they may need to rethink and will discuss tonight and maybe poll gop senators about whether they want time. Main feeling is that time may be right thing to do, but wrong thing for them to do here https://t.co/F1BlPPetk4
Think Trump told him this? K is too smart to believe this is all orchestrated https://t.co/X4TzWC7YOv
He is passionate - here and when he wrote about how he was outraged and disgusted by Clinton and then designed the most lurid and perversely sexual questions I have seen by a political operative. Point is- he gets deep into his feelings. https://t.co/ZCjB2zTxOG
Guy is just a treasure trove for Trump critics. https://t.co/fT6GFkymOi
“Performance”? With friends like these... https://t.co/dmVg1sLBur
Another nod that these partisans are not here for truth...only advantage. This is the wrong place to work out claims like this. These people are BS truth that doesn’t suit their agenda https://t.co/j5etHLzzZD
And his yearbook uses same “who won that anyway?” line suggesting he was drunk and forgot more than once.  He is compelling here on central questions but defending a “never did anything wrong ever in my life” line is tough to make credible. https://t.co/Y2FCqYpCFN
Of course he does. Trump believes Trump is a function of how people feel about something - not facts https://t.co/ozn1M225FF
K insisting on being perfect in every way may please Trump but it is at odds with what seems sincere abt him https://t.co/wNcz3jTi9R
So what happened? https://t.co/Jogd3VbVgI
Loves it but never did it to excess. This is the most suspect statement given all the corroboration against it https://t.co/dy5UImJ6lx
Or take a lie detector. And arguendo, if his perfect portrait was false and he was a hard partier, could it be he was there and did this but doesn’t remember? Or he was there and didn’t intend what Ford perceived? Or is she just making it up? Which is most likely at this point? https://t.co/ivm7QNBS2D
More specifically - k’s anger excited righty men...women tend to see his anger as off-putting and proof of a disposition they don’t admire https://t.co/Vm6vo7MAho
Interesting how the anger of K made the righties on here so happy. Such empty currency when it comes to truth and reason. Being angry doesn’t make you credible. In fact, it can suggest the opposite. https://t.co/3s21BFo5lw
So what? Why all the questioning of whether this is a stunt? This is not about the truth of the substance - it is about making it political and competing political agendas. This is not what matters here! https://t.co/t1SjRWtyeT
This is the better example of what we need to struggle with... what is a valid defense, what warrants action? Politics pollute the truth https://t.co/YwicC4LLzy
This is not hype. This is a lousy way to deal with a real struggle. How do we respect accusers, make them feel safe to disclose? How do we assess truth and consequence? How do we weigh accusations and denials? What proof is needed and from whom? None of that is focus here https://t.co/6SEcrmyCwX
BS issue. Lawyer paid. Problem with this cultural question being negotiated among partisans who want specific outcomes. https://t.co/oItKjzUiAv
Didn’t testify yet https://t.co/haSAnf9Gq0
When I read this I thought it was honorable of gop to put someone in the position who is not a hit man. But she now has a job to do...and we are dealing with a cultural struggle in a setting where no one is focused on the struggle only the outcome. Politics poisons https://t.co/92ZdiICJJJ
Good for them for owning what they did and why. Rare these days, certainly rare in media. Whether or not you agree with the sensitivity - the no bs transparency is valuable. https://t.co/kPQGUqOrqc
Before any testimony heard, without a record created of what all witnesses say...many lawmakers minds’ are made up https://t.co/i6Y7MqUNxj
SIRIUSXM 124 from 12-2 EST I will be on an covering hearing and taking your questions abt this and rosenstein mtg today. Be heard! 866-967-6887 #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/KYnlRU3mwx
Maybe. Let’s see what happens https://t.co/BsztdKkwm5
Let’s see what happens and then ask me that again https://t.co/KYnlRU3mwx
Depends about what https://t.co/alo2sNPRY1
First question is who is we? I have reported and argued since this started to GO SLOW. Don’t assume, don’t jump, don’t rush, don’t just choose to believe. Investigate, eliminate what seems false or too thin, isolate what needs testing and do that. Then vote https://t.co/5nzvrpz7ue
Even if K were lying about his past partying, even under oath...is that enough? And if it is not shown or even strongly suggested he is lying and to blame for the more serious allegations...is that the bar of satisfaction the senators will need? https://t.co/axo7ohxFae
Even if k did lie, is that enough to keep him off the court? and that may be the worst of what can be shown to any satisfaction - certainly tomorrow #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/CuqkNqw3uC
Help a side? The job is to create a record. They develop background they don’t make a case in this context.  They found they could not corroborate claim of Hill. All the more reason for gop to sue them to assemble record for k https://t.co/skGiQ2LIBU
How dare I what? What’s your point? https://t.co/KICAuGVBn0
And you, sir, may want to recall the need for the fbi in this process: not to decide, by to create a darinrecord of all relevant parties and witnesses. Something you all seem slow to want to do. It is your job to decide what matters and to vote. They can help. https://t.co/evTG2qskLK
The risk of doing an interview where you say all the convenient things to a friendly face and where you are not tested… Is that if/when discrepancies and hard questions come out… They seem to be even more relevant because you never addressed them. https://t.co/ywrOW2U9qP
Helsinki redux. Meet with putin alone? Awesome idea! https://t.co/VfsafZL87p
This will never happen https://t.co/vsjwoxjO9q
“It is a con job but when I hear her I may change my mind”. “All three will be heard”. Really?? https://t.co/n2KGvXLWYe
Trump calls the accusations against judge Kavanaugh “a big fat con job” BUT then says he will listen to the accuser tomorrow and he may change his mind. #doublespeak https://t.co/OzdouujQoj
That’s not true. and not the standards. You rape someone and no one else is there, are you saying impossible to prove? We would never have church cases or gymnastics cases. Be fair. Trump can’t be your only guide https://t.co/jkcdyCGNAg
And church abuse allegations. These men sound foolish, and that’s sad. They should all be calling to do a simple review of who can prove what. The time is worth the takeaway for them and us https://t.co/Oi3q0Cwvto
None. And stop blaming the victim https://t.co/BX20yBI7Ke
Disagree. People who suffers what they say are survivors. I never said all must be believed. I said you must vet all to know what to believe. Stop talkin BS. https://t.co/d2HSjmpRRi
If you are K, do you want Trump defending you vs allegations involving treatment of women?
Tell us how you know all women are lying? You don’t. And that’s messed up https://t.co/H2Pzk34Hfq
Worst part: struggle is real for us to figure out how to deal with these allegations outside criminal context and we are doing it in worst place...because political partisans are exacerbating all the problems. Hardest problem in control of worst problem solvers
I think we don’t know. I think Avenatti is not the issue except for those who don’t want to deal with the issues. And I think that the clear intent to do the minimum by gop is a problem for them and unfair to k https://t.co/FUYzrKezGi
Will Trump get a win but lose the women he had? https://t.co/Abks3zAUTv
All of that is true. Short shrift to claims hurts women, K, and the rest of us. https://t.co/Z6hitZxGvJ
But gop and potus say no. A hearing and their staffers is enough. That’s the point. https://t.co/HDrJT7IMnS
More allegations, yes. More assault allegations? No. https://t.co/yo1g71pN4P
Lies? And only my mom and one other get to call me that :) https://t.co/A2f4CAYEax
Be careful - nothing is admitted or proven to a certainty. My point is pushing process is having the allegations hang is not fair to K if what he says is true. My problem is not him - it is how this is handled https://t.co/N4y62chp06
It matters but don’t think you can expect ford to argue the strengths of other people’s allegations, can you? https://t.co/uZnxvGFV9Y
If they hear both sides and they are equally compelling and K is confirmed ... a year from now has it faded? Is there any lasting effect? https://t.co/A9s19CxyR0
Odd...assuming that gop knew abt other allegations that are now public, why did they go so hard on  “there would be more than one” when ford came forward. Now you have 3.
I had Avenatti on for a reason - and it proved to be as I suggested. Many have egg on their face - but that and avenatti are a distraction. How do you vet swetnick claim? What is right way forward? Does Fairness to K demand ability to say we looked and it is not sufficient? https://t.co/O1ISKDAfxJ
Andy is 6’ and I am 6’8” - in the fantasy land that is Andy Radio! https://t.co/99dZVTNSB7
Low bar https://t.co/t789Ph9V1a
Zero doubt? That makes zero sense https://t.co/By8KRJGbjS
Blame is meaningless. How we got here is secondary. Opinions on who is right are premature ... the focus should be process. How do we vet and move forward? https://t.co/tMhzXD1j1l
The answer lies in the location of Cohen’s other hand. https://t.co/P1IJVpv2sR
If that were the case - the questions and the non responsiveness is of value. But these can not be partisan issues. https://t.co/ogGvFTLSBR
Calls raining in on SIRIUSXM 124. What happens next? Do you believe #swetnick ? Should it be investigated ? 866-967-6887
Impossible to confuse with that furrowed furry brow https://t.co/ZMXM4VBuO7
People do follow me and harrass me. On here. In person it is - “ I support the president, do you really think he says things that aren’t true? Aren’t things better?” Polite. Discreet. Here - phony tough. And the men here with the “beat you up” BS  - never in person https://t.co/BPIGIZPhjP
I don’t. Too ez to deceive. And there is a reason the fringe types do it. Desperate to be relevant. Ignore https://t.co/AZIm4IN1SY
Doesn’t deserve it - cheap tricks to tantalize...and he is not relevant to administration. https://t.co/UAoqMipzTM
Calling people that makes you simple. https://t.co/3M413URi6Y
They don’t own it. Never did. Saying something doesn’t make it true. Despite what potus seems to think https://t.co/zgYRGsKouu
I said it was a private restaurant. It is in the segment. I also cited time place and manner conditions in the set up. This is abt the wider notion of tactics and having the right vs being right. You ignore what doesn’t work for you - that makes you weak. Don’t be weak Larry. https://t.co/hnHnI0mcYW
Question: if McConnell is right that this is all digging for dirt by Dems on K, none of it is legit like Trump says, then why didn’t they do it with GORSUCH? Same school. Same years basically. None of the same allegations. Tell me?
6’2, 225. Bad neck :) https://t.co/pxYx1wERgj
Not about facts; it is about feelings for too many. Thanks. https://t.co/mA7QSIu0y4
Muy rico! Free...but costs you your family https://t.co/WZL4F7WAel
Nutritious. Though that was closer to accurate than the rest of the tweet https://t.co/lsncIQXqd6
Heard the fishing is awesome but that documentary worries me. Thanks for the good word - and it always helps - though others deserve it far more. #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/8lJejBG8Jh
I am not cheap! https://t.co/Sqv176a1tj
We are how we want to be. The struggle is to be better. The goal is to be decent. https://t.co/RCNhyVMr7D
Will this prove a sound argument? We know Thursday. https://t.co/62oP7cFM0Y
When I make an argument it is to provoke thought - agreement and disagreement. Both are necessary to find common ground. Thanks for the respect of your attention https://t.co/WJxZyMnbWc
Interesting choice for counsel: a sex crimes prosecutor who has spoken on the vulnerability of the victims. https://t.co/h6qqBXgkdm
We now see the truth of the trump admin intentions. And it is what we were told would not happen. My invitation to the secy stands. https://t.co/CaC3l7qOly
They were there about k.  And i don’t need a lecture on lecturing. I am the only who argued for the kids tonight and the policy being slipped in while our heads are turned away. I get the need to get after power. But how you do it matters https://t.co/Lqc0AhU53x
Appreciate the interest but I must demur. This stuff has layers and context. That’s not BS. Truth is not always simple and I think we give you a unusually honest take. Don doesn’t backpedal https://t.co/qdLBuCPGYr
That’s the argument. Public official must be held to account. https://t.co/eNuShovhmk
“Female assistant” why refer to outside counsel that way? Even the lawyer gets implicitly marginalized. Bad enough a hired counsel will do thinking for gop
I don’t block unless you abuse someone else. I see insults as weakness ... because they are. When we spar, the one who runs the mouth is the one who runs away. https://t.co/olBWLVpV73
No. But talk about some different things. Look better on POTUS. https://t.co/sZvwOQWVmP
Aggriendly. https://t.co/XT4t5SezFK
Thanks for lighting up the call board on #LetsGetAfterIt siriusxm ch 124. C u tomorrow from 12-2 and tonight on @CuomoPrimeTime 9p est.
She is allegedly open minded on K despite party loyalty. That’s my point. Thank you for listening. 866-967-6887 call me. https://t.co/p40P1kEVl3
True https://t.co/p40P1kEVl3
Oops. 866-967-6887 https://t.co/6yTheBbAI9
Want to say something to me? Do it.  SiriusXM 124. 12-2EST #LetsGetAfterIt
Did she? We have. And continue to. https://t.co/4iaJd7RW2b
And what a tradition it is. A tradition of non disclosure, bogus bases for refusing to explain what only becomes obvious once on the bench. Weak example of providing valuable advice...great example of consent by whoever is in power. https://t.co/0biaRg5DJW
Anybody seen Paul Ryan? Any word on whether mueller needs protecting? McConnell? Anyone?
Former governor doesn’t even mention the women https://t.co/VBuPJDkaAZ
This is certainly a national problem. Wages. Seems simple until you remember why they are low: cheaper labor elsewhere. And we empower profits. Stock prices. So those with stocks and at top of Corp structure win. The 1%. That’s why the gap is yawning. How fix? https://t.co/WAdoVWHB8x
And this tension, tells the story. GOP also is far more interested in getting to bottom of delay by Dems than the truth of the actual allegations. Odd. https://t.co/ddgUyZoFiP
But will he? https://t.co/JQ5FRatemY
No one should want someone compromised by unfounded allegations. The point is to merely investigate. Show you care by doing so. Then you remove doubt and expose allegations as strong or weak. https://t.co/AuNo1Uwpja
This is the risk of kavanaugh complete defense of never doing anything alleged. Others will disagree. https://t.co/h3C71IbmLK
Good thing she has never said anything before that would suggest an affinity for such contemptible notions https://t.co/CvXri655dE
Senator is right to be concerned but what to do when either happens? https://t.co/3D3wjT0873
Disagree. While k statement abt virginity came vs Avenatti claims, it did seem to serve as a general defense - that he was not into any such behavior as is alleged https://t.co/VOYovmk6ye
And...does not being sexually active in high school and college make one less likely to try something like this?  Kavanaugh seems think his alleged chastity is a defense. Is it? https://t.co/RI3B3NS3MR
Kavanaugh certainly had all the “right” answers...of course they weren’t tested as they will be on Thursday. https://t.co/HWNGVZriyz
Never mad.  This is about reason not emotion. Too many here feel for positions. SIRIUSXM 124 TODAY 12-2   let’s TALK not just tweet.  866-967-6887 #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/mj2x07Eh74
talking about the process. Of course I am skeptical of everything.  The lack of a search is the problem. I am not suggesting an outcome. If you don’t look - and you don’t know diddly about what can or can’t be corroborated because it hasn’t been shown to you - u cant find. https://t.co/u0rgoBJCPa
My team at abc news exposed mangum and changed fate for duke kids. Do your homework or be quiet https://t.co/GPq5JwFjOi
I think about that. We would fight for the truth. Witnesses, proof of corroboration. Not allowing him to be judged until all was known. That isn’t happening here. Those in control are saying they don’t need to know to decide. https://t.co/WiT3z7OBK2
Proven to what point? Reviewed by whom? Keep going. https://t.co/L8Y34kf6eX
Are crimes the only wrongs? If we argue and I bop you in the nose, little chance of prosecution (most assault or battery statutes require injury that a bop would not meet)...but it is wrong. Add a great delay in disclosure because of distress so statute has run...now what? https://t.co/Sc1vwuIMfN
Any chance a woman would ever write this? Fellas, why is my thread replete with angry middle aged white men who think any allegation of assault without video and a confession is weak and that being conservative means being cruel? https://t.co/OzvjC2kyev
Partisans can lie. Part of why politics engenders disrespect. That’s why we test. What bothers me is all the men on here exhibiting dispositions that explain why we have so many allegations in the first place. Cruel cave men. https://t.co/7FkO65TJ4u
Touché. False accusations happen. The problem is that there is no earnest effort to figure out the truth. And this isn’t about harrassment or workplace wrong (which matter too of course) - ford alleges an assault. And attempted rape. https://t.co/00TfmCAqMD
That’s the way to be. You only know what you can show. HOWEVER, remember what this is about for GOP - they are trying to secure a generation of jurisprudence. That’s what K represents. https://t.co/QuaBuJbJ7J
@CuomoPrimeTime has been trying to get his accuser. We discuss on radio show. SIRIUSXM 124. 12-2. Know more. Tweet less. https://t.co/kBiqlXRW4N
It matters A LOT. and even a vulnerable accuser outside a court of law probably has to make a shoe in order to be convincing. And must the accused unlike at trial. What satisfies? And by what measure? We don’t know. And we don’t struggle to find out. And so we are stuck https://t.co/jJx2XWQm4O
First - I think the time has come for you all to show yourselves. If you want to be heard, be seen and own it. 2nd, what system? We are not in court. Do your kids get a jury trial option? No - we need to figure out what the standard and burden are. That’s my point https://t.co/SsnyGubGiV
Good thing this guy doesn’t work for the Catholic Church. A lot of good people who still be searching for justice and respect. Weak argument that reinforces the problem. https://t.co/WDiItiC1x9
Remember what is at stake. You see a situation about potential abuse of women, others see a man who is the key to a generation of jurisprudence. The key to delivering in a signature promise to base. And some of them see obliging former as surrendering the latter. https://t.co/ZfxquzSkzo
I see it a little differently: while I agree Kavanaugh intentionally did not shake the man’s hand, the situation speaks more to how far his GOP supporters will go to insulate him. https://t.co/2rEddV1y1O
We have invited prof ford and the others on @CuomoPrimeTime. We can’t force them on and some are not ready. If an allegation is true you must remember how hard it can be for someone who was victimized to talk about it let alone to be scrutinized https://t.co/GUYC8Vx8dc
Hard to judge until you see how he answers when tested. Again, kavanaugh may be telling truth. His problem: credible allegation, friend who was very very different, yearbook gives different view and potential assessments may counter. But GOP won’t allow witnesses. Odd? https://t.co/Y87uVzyrrn
Refusing to give any legitimacy to people claiming abuse has worked really well for us so far. Odd to hear a middle aged man criticizing such a change. Not. https://t.co/JycvEYahDT
A man who calls for transparency is not always one who will provide it. Ugly politics. https://t.co/SdIn43aV13
He picked a friendly forum for intv. People often think a pass is what they need but when people have real questions about you, they want to see you tested. If you don’t struggle with what matters, you don’t change minds. https://t.co/RsoqOT8wHf
It is how the scandals are handled...it is the unwillingness to be accountable and to address connected problem of who can be a priest. Just allowing married priests would infuse massive amounts of retirees and devotees into fold and flock would follow https://t.co/XKvkfSk5Xe
Age was 18 then. Whether he is telling truth abt his behavior is an open question - as is whether senators care https://t.co/uLLLS1VK5X
Stop lying Capt Caps. I never said he said he didn’t drink. He made a point of saying you could drink at 18. And that’s what happened. Be right or be quiet. https://t.co/EwTuhwqF5T
Fair assessment but kavanaugh is making it sound on fox right now as if he never drank until he was a senior and may have sometimes merely had a few too many and never had sex - ever - until maybe after college. https://t.co/RPcWka6C0Q
Interesting intv tactic: instead of testing #kavanaugh credibility, ask him to test the accuser’s credibility. Then follow by asking if he is surprised the New Yorker would publish such a thing (as if it was mere gossip). Quite the fox pressure cooker here.
Did you workout? No. Why? My (whatever) hurts. My day is too packed. Weather sucks. Tomorrow is better. Really? Tell him: https://t.co/QVFcSgYK1t
#LetsGetAfterIt, genius. https://t.co/1Lq0StJfi1
Nice. Hope you can handle her. Whenever you take off your tight little biker pants, give a call! :) https://t.co/4T9BX9rNm2
Seeking a safe harbor - not the strongest sign of confidence. https://t.co/wcSOhBs6Yq
You don’t. Was a bit glitchy at top. All good now. Catch me tonight on @CuomoPrimeTime and tomorrow at noon on ch 124 #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/aqKv5h1iJb
Odd to poll before anyone has heard directly from accuser or accused? https://t.co/SIcuHfwMko
He doesn’t know the tribe. @QtipTheAbstract is my man. https://t.co/bh6i42b12a
Cuomo and a cannoli! A nice snack. Thanks! SiriusXM 124 12-2... 866-967-6887 https://t.co/bN0uNvAiFQ

#LetsGetAfterIt ! https://t.co/2e7vwDjg6i
Whatever you do - DONT DEVIATE FROM THE TRIBE! :) come on brother...open your mind https://t.co/OtG3YZVmxV
Listen to me on SIRIUSXM 124 and call in 866-967-6887! Right now until 2pm
No kidding. I am saying why resign if you think you will be fired? https://t.co/h325HAa7QP
THANKS for the love abt show. All part of same vibe with CPT. And for those saying I will only take fake calls...try me: 866-96-POTUS. And  for those who are using their heads as a hat rack, please call early and often.  866-96-POTUS. Q’s abt news or whatever you are feeling. https://t.co/Ft81SqN60f
He can’t be meeting with potus, right? Trump is in NYC/at UN. Traffic is horrible FYI. Is this a kelly special? Who leaks first, WH or Rosenstein? https://t.co/ru72frt5Mi
Either you resign or you don’t.  If he thinks he is getting fired - find out. Let potus make the call. Odd machinations. https://t.co/ru72frt5Mi
Big #Rosenstein and #Kavanaugh news. SiriusXM ch 124 - listen or holler at your boy from 12pm - 2. My new show #LetsGetAfterIt starts TODAY! Mostly call in. So don’t tweet tough, call in and bring it on. And tonight @CuomoPrimeTime has @MichaelAvenatti and @GoldstoneRob. Wow!
Raises plenty of questions...and we will ask them on @CuomoPrimeTime tonight! 9p EST https://t.co/5Pf8lJjmks
Trolls are those intentionally disrupting with falsehoods and invective - plenty are simply mean or unproductive on here. I distinguish between the two because the latter can be reasoned with. https://t.co/7mK6k3jSLf
They went with their sense of where majority would be - and were apparently rewarded. You are the one treating politics as a demented game of survivor, so let’s see how it works for you :) https://t.co/8uJNHMao8Y
You mean age well. And we are saying the same thing. https://t.co/rZQ1l74t1o

Fair point - until you take the next step: graham and GOP in general have come off wholly uninterested in trying to test the accusation https://t.co/ZdAn6XZnsS
1. 1 IN SIX women suffer assault or attempted assault.                               2. Close to 70% don’t report in large part because they are afraid of not being believed.                                     3. 98% of assaulters do NOT get punished https://t.co/NaZQRhUCXL
Or was graham just given too much credit for being independent ? https://t.co/hhAQkiCS2Q

I can’t say. But I can say that not all allegations are true but by refusing to properly vet what ford says they seem unfair and they are compromising kavanaugh. https://t.co/YrBciKUL7P

Would you suggest that you should never question a president's actions with respect to an inferior officer ever? -- hear how @JaySekulow, President Trump's personal lawyer, answers that and so much more on #CuomoPrimeTime #LetsGetAfterIt https://t.co/yxkfCYLx53
But there will be no trial. That’s the problem, the struggle in situations like this. What are the standards of judgment? How do we proceed and discern allegation vs conclusion? Lots of agendas can mask the truth. As we see right here and right now https://t.co/M7OPMs3FwK
But there will be no trial. So what do you do? Ignore all allegations that are not subject to prosecution? Clearly we can not. And this is a struggle. Simple declarations like yours do not reflect reality and do not improve the situation. https://t.co/fBI5dPK406
This is certainly not an unbiased body. The pushback on any delay makes that additionally clear. Why rush? To remove any chance of K getting further compromised. This is abt getting him thru for GOP. Not abt looking for reasons to remove him. Inherently biased https://t.co/sCUeNOxUJc
How am I missing the point by asking a question that relates to that exact point? It is not always as simple as you make it in this context - that’s why an investigation is in doubt.   That’s why I am asking what you all think about it. https://t.co/2sjMhnLlul

Why not do both? Like with Hill. Bush asked fbi to intv who they could and see if they could corroborate. they looked and did not. https://t.co/8m0uz6DyXB
Who is playing? That’s your bias. An allegation can be true or false.  Kavanaugh should have every right to defend and confront. And in court of public opinion, accuser may have burden of corroboration. But Ford matters and best efforts should be made to know the truth https://t.co/bVdgsagaPN

Kavanaugh drew criticism for being cute in some responses and reactions (potus exposure tonlegal process, “settled law”, handshake with parkland dad). Cute is a nice way of saying deceptive. Will that tendency manifest again and read as disingenuous on Ford allegation? https://t.co/u0T3Dq3qdN
Allegation vs kavanaugh is specific and comes from the woman who says it happened to her. That said - this piece - while designed to defuse kavanaugh woes - goes to part of the struggle: how do we assess allegations in a public setting? What are our standards and strictures? https://t.co/lRg415dJhd
What is our standard? What do we tolerate? How do we assess? These are real considerations that demand leaders - not just those constantly seeking leverage. You can empower the accuser and the accused. https://t.co/93OnHvqabP

Trump paradox in one tweet. He could just celebrate the second part. Spin that. But his success must always be coupled with a call for someone else’s failure. And once again he is wrong on facts. And he knows it. So that makes it a lie.#BeBest https://t.co/TTNjFNxoPC

Trump attnys cut deal to answer #SummerZervos questions in writing. Is case a major issue? Not at this point but the reluctance to speak for himself is notable. Also reflects his legal team worries about his ability to speak the truth?
@serenawilliams now making the point that could be a flashpoint: that she is fighting for women to be able to be strong and not be judged differently than men #USOPEN
#osaka is something. She didn’t want to disrespect the audience or the people she beat by succumbing to her being in awe of Serena and not playing her best. That’s deep. #USOPEN
That’s your opinion. Serena made the gender point. And I have see a lot bad behavior by top men and. It see penalties like this. https://t.co/y7R8Nh6DyL
#osaka showing tremendous grace. Her words about her mom and her dad (who can’t handle watching so he walks around the stadium!). Respect for Serena. She made history from her country, man or woman to win grand slam. Well played during and after match!
@serenawilliams class act! Telling fans to stop booing and congratulates #Osaka who was amazing. Serena could have dominated this moment but she was very generous under the circs.
You are saying she didn’t get the violation for coaching but that was only one step. Violating for racket. Taking the point. Taking a game. Very harsh moves. And Serena clearly said I know the rules. This always happens to me here. It is because I am a woman. https://t.co/4VZqkNw8UE
What will @serenawilliams say at the ceremony?  She was very gracious to #Osaka at net - and the winner here was outstanding. @ChrissieEvert made the right points about coaching and the match. Then penalty put the match out of reach though Osaka was in command.
You know how often they coach and it is not called? Know how often penalties are assessed as this chair has? Can he justify it? Yes.  The rules allow it - but it is a harsh move especially in this situation. https://t.co/zUsPSYRKF9
Hey pally - go find me a guy penalized a game for something similar - let alone in this situation, as a champion in a major championship. https://t.co/fP17DslCud
#Osaka is playing brilliantly to this point and she has done nothing wrong at all, but that was not a fair call by chair.
This #SerenaWilliams match is going to be a big story. She was penalized a point and then a full game!  She made point men do much worse and are not penalized at all and she is right.

Disagree.  You learn nothing from an echo. You have to hear your opposition. You will either hone your own arguments or maybe even learn something new. Common ground cannot be found otherwise https://t.co/bjLF6blrLF
America at her best leads with her heart not her hate. Make America great again... catchy... but the true greatness lies in what you make America...the choice is yours. https://t.co/wAMvbLMKri

Wow - almost criticism from a trumper of an objectively reckless reaction from trump. Almost. https://t.co/h6ejIJvImd
Well argued by kavanaugh but also proof of the slippery nature of precedent. He is right nominees all punt. And that is wrong. So it is precedent and also bad precedent. https://t.co/UnQ2px28UE
If the senate hadnt conspired tonplay a game of posturing and power plays when it comes to scotus, things would be different.  Nominees from both sides hedge and hide and get muscles through. This is why people get angry abt politics https://t.co/Givl8FDT4m
Like “settled law”; like “i would have to know facts to tell you any thoughts on the subject”; “inappropriate” is hedge by a very clever political operator to avoid scrutiny https://t.co/jvlFvuoRq3
No - it is proof an obvious hedge; an attempt to deceive about one’s true feelings. He has written and spoken and been a political operative for people - all create a clear understanding of his feelings that he now denies out of convenience. That’s the problem. https://t.co/OxPBD64k1c
And if they hear the person who wrote it denying doing so, do you think they should out them? https://t.co/mkO5wIJdX2
Is Senator Susan Collins still comfortable with Kavanaugh on Roe after this? The man clearly has opinions he has shared in the past that he won’t own now. https://t.co/bqP9LP5LW7
You won't change Trump but you can change the dependence on him. Assuming a fraction of the stories are true - and they are - all the more reason for Congress to do what it promised in the last elections...take power back from the executive and do the job for the rest of us. https://t.co/eoiFsdMydY

“Hypothetical” means “that I don’t want to answer” https://t.co/2bvZ0GyADn

More tried and true BS done by left and right judges. General statement that means nothing and then refusing to answer real question under guise of objectivity. Then on court they suddenly have a bent. Inane process? https://t.co/KCbWUOaL4r
SCOTUS confirmations are often abt what is not said… Saying roe is settled law…meaningless at Supreme Court level. They settle and unsettled law… That’s what they do. We need to hear more. And then there is this example: this means nothing. https://t.co/I8OxIIW79M
And as anyone who knew trump pre-base knows...that’s when he backs off, lest he get deposed and exposed like with @TimOBrien in NYT suit https://t.co/Xla1ztODl6
Right message from pope? https://t.co/SYauECjzBh
Yet not a word of reproach. Not a word to the president.  Why not? Judges. Rolling back protections. Chance to undo equality and reproductive rights. Trump is a means to an end for the right. So they keep swallowing whatever he says. https://t.co/MjBTj1CkCG
Is this grandstanding or breaking out? Campaigns are built on projection of purpose - sparked by a message that attracts support. Do we see that with Dems for 2020? https://t.co/IUlh2lHubo

Shame=truth is only believed by our president when he likes it. potus is referring to a 2-time Pulitzer winning, watergate exposing legend, whom he called to kiss up and tell they were always fair.

Why would #KavanaughSCOTUS do this? https://t.co/7171dsmfng
Or is he compromising his own integrity - without outside influence ? https://t.co/aYTqkGFCl4
That’s one way to look at it. https://t.co/E1DQLxReSE
Not out until next week. And the WH - “this is all untrue” - only driving interest. Maybe if they used a different defense once in a while there would be more credibility. https://t.co/MreipwxTWf

transition costs are high. Require tax increases that I don’t think people want. People who didn’t even really benefit from trump tax cuts are in favor of more of them - even though it’s going to strip their essential services and add to debt. This is abt choices https://t.co/560cEQi6Dv

Wrong. Violence is illegal except in self defense. I have never stated support of any group nor would I. My point is there is no moral equivalence between hate and those opposing it. You twist because you want division. That’s your problem. https://t.co/LfmVN1Vhf5

First - he used it, red x. Second - whistles are about context. A black man talking gratuitously about confederacies and monkeys and who is articulate is not an equal concern. You know that but you want to talk down the problem. And that is the problem. https://t.co/bWM3gsjbIG

When your devoted allies tell you that you are falling short - is it time to listen?
