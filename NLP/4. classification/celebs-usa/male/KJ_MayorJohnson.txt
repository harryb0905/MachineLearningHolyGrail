While there are issues that still must be addressed we are in a much stronger fiscal position today than we have been in years.
We are addressing long-term liabilities to improve the city’s credit rating and growing our Economic Uncertainty Reserve.
We have approached this budget in a fiscally responsible manner. We have ensured a surplus for the second straight year.
This budget includes efforts to create jobs by diversifying our economy and fostering a business-friendly environment.
We are upgrading Sacramento’s infrastructure. such as parks, pools, sidewalks, street improvements, street lighting and bike paths.
We are also adding 15 firefighters, building a new fire station and bringing two new ambulances online.
In this budget we'll add 43 new positions in our PD, fund a gang prevention task force &amp; create a hiring program to increase PD diversity.
A new era for Sacramento’s budget - we are in a much stronger fiscal position today than we have been in years.  http://t.co/vRrVPAI2UO

The word "lynching", has a long and painful history in our nation. It's time to remove its use in CA Law.
During public comments last night I was shocked to learn, in CA removing someone from police custody is defined as "lynching"...(con't)
It is also the right of citizens to protest peacefully &amp; make their voices heard like during public comments @ City Council Meetings.(con't)
It is never ok for someone to interfere with the police, or try to remove someone who is in police custody…(con't)

Top 5 reason why the State of the City is important to Sacramento http://t.co/adZGVf20bH
We will continue to work to ensure this decline in crime continues.
This week at the POTUS Task Force on 21st Century Community Policing, I was proud to report on this success. (Cont)
Going forward we will continue to work in lockstep to ensure crime rates go down, while community trust goes up. (Cont)
These types of results wouldn’t be possible without the City, the Chief, the peace officers, and the community working together. (Cont)
The latest stats show we're making progress creating a safer Sac including the eye-popping reduction in homicides, now @ a 41 yr low. (Cont)
When I ran for Mayor six years ago, I said that public safety would be my top priority.(cont)

Quite frankly, our expectations were exceeded.
Commissioner Silver made his decision not because of a threat, but because it was the right thing to do.
A boycott was never mentioned in my conversations with Commissioner Silver.
....where sports provides a place for fundamental change on how our country should think and act.
I believe this stands as one of those great moments where sports once again transcends...(con't)
The biggest stars to the everyday players in the league were unafraid - they came out strong and powerful.
Let me say how proud I am of the players of this league for standing up for themselves.
The NBPA feels this is an opportunity to enhance our relationship and transform it into a true partnership
Commissioner Silver, the players salute you for your unequivocal, decisive action.
Thanks for coming @SteveNash and thanks to all the NBA players that attended today's press conference. http://t.co/kjmu8UwZss

Amazing news in Sac!  We have a budget SURPLUS for the 1st time in 7yrs. Our city continues to get stronger and we're not done yet...
I will be keeping Chris Paul, the Executive Committee, and all player representatives informed of every step.
While I originally came on to lead the Executive Director search, this issue requires immediate attention from the players association.
I will be formally reaching out to the NBA today to determine our next steps....(con't)
I have spoken with NBPA President Chris Paul and I will be leading the NBPA in addressing the implications of this serious matter...(con't)
There needs to be an immediate investigation and if the reports are true, there needs to be strong and swift action taken....(con't)
The NBPA must and will play a very active role in determining how this issue is addressed.
The reported comments made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling are reprehensible and unacceptable....con't

We look forward to talking with all of them again in Dallas.
I believe the owners realize that there is far more to think about than just an increased bid. They know what this story means to the NBA.
The ownership group, the city, and the community have shown the NBA, without any shred of doubt, that the Sacramento Kings belong in Sac.
can put together a plan and organization to ensure the franchise can rebuild and thrive.
This was always about whether Sacramento, a community that has supported the NBA for 28 years... cont'
The NBA leadership and owners have always said that their decision would not be dictated by a bidding war.
We feel very confident about the position we are in right now.
Nothing feels better than giving back to your city. Volunteer to rebuild McKinley Park June 4 -9  for more info go to http://t.co/jVLrBcbdOC

That's what I'm talking about SACRAMENTO!!!!! WE DID IT!!!!!
As with U.S. Sec of Transportation Ray LaHood, I look forward to a strong working relationship with Mayor @anthonyfoxx  in his new role.
I also want to commend President Barack Obama for looking to a local leader to fill such an important position.
Mayor @anthonyfoxx  has shown great leadership during his time as Mayor of Charlotte.
I want to congratulate Mayor @anthonyfoxx on his nomination as the new U.S. Secretary of Transportation.
I'm a big @TimTebow fan. Excited to see where he'll land next. When one door closes another opens! Romans 8:28

Exciting day for Sacramento! Our bid is in! Feeling real good about our chances. #PlayingToWin
This is big! This ad is running in times square every 5 minutes. Now that's #playingtowin  http://t.co/XiNHAmsfhf
A big shout out to @SacramentoCVB for making that ad! Just another example of our community stepping up. #playingtowin
A very sad day. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families of the tragedy in Boston.
to make sure we leave it all on the court. For all of these reasons, we feel good about where we stand.
That said, we of course are prepared to maintain the full court press we have applied over the last several months...cont'
which is why as we head into the meetings in New York City next week we are following the process established by the NBA....cont'
We know the NBA has never moved a team from a market that has performed and where a clear path to an arena has been demonstrated....cont'
and securing significant fan and corporate support...cont'
Sacramento is playing to win, including having assembled a world class ownership group; voting to move forward on an arena....cont'
We have Californians who've helped create Tibco, 24 Hour Fitness, Qualcomm, and now, Facebook all working for the future of Sacramento.
When we started this project, I never imagined so many important leaders from across CA become a part of it.
This is exciting news! I’ve gotten to know @thatchriskelly through Democratic politics and his leadership on important issues. #playingtowin
Congrats to the cal lady bears on a great season. You balled this year! #gobears

@ColinHanks Thanks for supporting the Kings. I'm a big fan. I'm here at the Rangers Pens game too.
Sea presenting now, then us. Going 2nd is a plus- like having the ball for the last shot in a tie game with a chance to hit the game-winner!
Almost game time! Excited to represent our community - we've done our part and have a great story to tell to the NBA! #playingtowin
“@Vivek: #HereWeStayKings.tumblr.com received so much GREAT stuff. We used it to to fire up the team"Vivek got us ready with a great video!"
Big News! Kings limited partner files intent to match offer on 7% with trustee. It's staying in Sacramento! #PlayingToWin
Thoughts and prayers to Greg Willard family. Didn't always agree with his calls, but a great guy who loved the game. He will be missed.

Up at 5 for a run. At work by 7. Lunch at my desk. Still energized! Tonight's historic vote can't come soon enough! #PlayingToWin
to supporting local artists and cultural infrastructure so vital to our city's future.  #playingtowin
The ESC only strengthens my commitment to work w/ my Council colleagues, as well as the arts, business and philanthropic leaders...(cont'd)
the long-term success of our local arts community and assets like the Crocker, Community Center Theater, &amp; B Street Theater....(cont'd)
that will host 100+ concerts &amp; family events per year. But the ESC is only 1 part of a much broader strategy that must also ensure...cont'd
Tonight’s vote is so much bigger than basketball. It’s also about enhancing arts &amp; culture through a world-class facility ... (cont'd)
Historic day in Sacramento! An opportunity to save our #Kings, create 4,000 jobs, and generate up to $1B in private investment downtown!
A true Dream Team! This Fab Four is a bracket buster. #PlayingToWin!
I'm thrilled to welcome Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs to Sacramento! Another visionary who believes strongly in this market. #playingtowin
Happy Passover! Enjoy your seders and don't eat too much matzah!
True team effort! Props to City Mgr John Shirey + team, esp Dan Barrett &amp; John Dangberg. All fought hard for City taxpayers &amp; core tenets.
With all that said...I'm pumped!!  Ron B &amp; I officially closed the deal a few mins ago - maybe this pic says it best! http://t.co/AThMg9sAG9
I'm excited to talk further about the deal with my Council colleagues and the public...
Once again, we're proving the strength of our market – both as host to an NBA team, but as an emerging region with global potential…
They will also make a 35-year commitment to keep the Sacramento Kings right here where they belong!....
The new ownership, historic in its reflection of our city's diversity, will invest up to $1B in Sac - a strong sign of confidence in our mkt
For a comparable investment to the 2012 deal, we've secured more private investment &amp; greater econ development potential at the new site…
Consistent w/our core tenets, the deal avoids new taxes, protects the City on the Kings loan, and ensures no net impact to the general fund…
I’m pleased to announce an agreement w/ Burkle-Mastrov-Ranadive group on a public-private partnership to build a new ESC at DT Plaza Mall...
It's a great day in Sacramento!!!!!
