@BarryJenkins @A24 damn this the best I’ve ever looked (sadly) - how the fuck do you do it????
@alfonsocuaron Gracias Alfonso!!!
If you are bored and Australian, Eighth Grade is now showing in theaters in Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Happy New Year to everyone. Twitter makes me hate everyone and myself so gonna back off again. Xx
@WhitneyCummings Love sent from B.O. “Body Odor” Bumham.
@jacquelinenovak @zinoman You weren’t shrinking! I was just restating your point about embodying the familiar as my own by adding more words. Twitter is hell and it stresses me out. ☃️
@jacquelinenovak @zinoman (P.s. I’m not trying to explain this to you like some asshole. This is just the weird twitter thing where u say stuff out loud just to say it for the other ppl reading. Just want this stuff to be written down for the record. Kate’s a genius and I’m pretentious✌️)
@jacquelinenovak @zinoman She demonstrates out loud and in real time the amount of historical and personal and contextual processing we all have to do in order to express any idea at any point. And she makes it funny. Wowzers.
@jacquelinenovak @zinoman 100%. Totally inimitable. And observational, yes! Observational about the act of observing. Her act (for me) is an embodiment of what it means to attempt to live right now with any self-awareness. It’s not just satirical. It’s deeply TRUE.
@zinoman “Catch up” not “match up” and “performative, liberal” not “performative liberal.” I hate writing about comedy, i don’t know how you do it, Jason.
@zinoman And she was doing the hyper self-aware deconstructive performative liberal stuff 5 years before that stuff was part of the popular culture. We are all playing match up to Kate. I’m being psychotic but she deserves the credit. Millennial Lenny Bruce or whatever I’m done goodbye.
@zinoman It’s the former. I’ve slipped into stealing Kate’s vibes without trying. Most influential/imitated comedian of a generation. She figured and mastered the performance angle we were all looking for.
@ElsieKFisher we were so young!!!
@normmacdonald Norm, this is so kind and means so much to me coming from you. Too much to express here but thank you thank you thank you. You’re one of the best of all time. I hope our paths cross soon.
Thank you, Alfonso. Was an honor meeting you. You are a genius. ROMA is beyond belief. https://t.co/JsumeWQRDr
@hunteryharris I’m HARD PREPPING, Hunter. Ready for all possible outcomes. I will WIN THIS DISCUSSION.

@BenSPLATT @ladygaga clean up on aisle me.
Incredibly honored to be nominated for a Gotham Award along with the legend @ElsieKFisher. We’re soaring! Flying, even! https://t.co/c7blGroEHg
Greg, the actor who played the principal in Eighth Grade, made this video. On his own. No one told him to do this. This is real. This is somehow real. Please watch so I am not alone in this. https://t.co/Kh2lNNn5em
We’re screening Eighth Grade at 100 schools for free the week of 10/22. Teachers and faculty can submit their schools at https://t.co/9ph7AhLvny - Students, convince the faculty by leaving lone red apples on their desk, they love that according to cartoons.
So if you’re young and still haven’t registered - I GET IT. I really do. But just do it. It’s really easy to do and it’s one of the only tangible things you can do in these weird times and it’s actually way less bad than the dentist. 2/2 https://t.co/2LaZW8aajy
I didn’t vote when I turned 18. I thought I was being cool and rebellious but I knew deep down that I was just being lazy because I was young and stressed out and hated going to the dentist (still do) and voting felt like the dentist to me. (1/2)
@TheBlack @A24 You didn’t go after the exposed shins and I appreciate that.
Eighth Grade is now available digitally on iTunes and other places. A bunch of deleted scenes and a commentary with me and the kid. Tell your friends. ✌️ https://t.co/1rTUGHPZZG https://t.co/oa9Tto23B2
@CoreyReviews @eighthgrademov @AndrewWehde Thank you bro!!!
@OHEducation @eighthgrademov @GatewayFC @OHEducationSupt Love this.
@bailsofheng Unforgiven
@mikelucianosup YES. It’s incredible.
His short story, Forever Overhead, is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. I would not have written Eighth Grade if I hadn’t read it. It’s about a young boy jumping off a diving board. Here’s David reading it himself. Rest In Peace. 2/2 https://t.co/kw6OjDhFI5
David Foster Wallace died 10 years ago today. He’s become a beacon for every pretentious male dickhead who thinks he’s smarter than you, and his legacy is being re-examined, appropriately, in light of the accounts of his personal treatment of women in his life. Given that...1/2

I played Ren in Footloose in my eighth grade musical. This tweet brings my creative life full circle so hard and is such a satisfying conclusion that I feel required to never make another thing ever again. I had fun though. I will now farm! https://t.co/kilIugN96x

@Shrink_Tank Thank you for the kind words!
@CoreyReviews @ElsieKFisher Appreciate it, corey!

@RayNarvaezJr I spelt your incorrectly but I’m gonna leave it I’m not ashamed
@RayNarvaezJr Thank you Ray. Always appreciate you’re support.
A few photos from the 50 free no-ratings-enforced screenings of Eighth Grade last night. Thank you to all the kids who came out. You’re the best. https://t.co/AfB1IWWBz6
@SarahBaska ❤️😭👍
@ScottMendelson @IAmRobbieClark Cont’d...but I generally wish kids were less exposed to such crazy shit. It’s a bummer. My producers and I did talk a lot about not wanting to wage some holy war because that felt tasteless and not the point of the movie. I’ll stop now though, thanks for listening, Scott.
@ScottMendelson @IAmRobbieClark Yes totally - I’m certainly not declaring war. I understand the impulse to want to protect kids. My view is just that the internet exposes them to everything, and better to put those things in context within a narrative then try to hide them from what they’ll find on their own.
@landonianempire @ElsieKFisher This is the best!
@SHLULLY Shit I’m sorry. Adults ruin everything.
@ScottMendelson @IAmRobbieClark We knew it’d get R. We’re just having fun with the irony of kids not being able to see unattended the life they live unattended. And I didn’t want to go to the movies with my parents at 14/15/16. Much preferred me and my friends. So it’s a night of a few kids getting to do that.
@ccarolynrose It’s the 7pm screening in Danvers that’s ratings free. Hope that helps! Check https://t.co/9ph7Ai36f6
@scottcwheeler NSFW
TONIGHT. 50 FREE screenings of our R-rated movie EIGHTH GRADE with no ratings enforced. So if you’re actually 13, you can come. One in every state. Info here https://t.co/9ph7Ai36f6 also, WARNING: https://t.co/djd0yqx3Mu

My dear friend and very funny person @peteholmes special airs tonight on HBO. He's a pile of joy and you deserve it.
@brendohare @NotoriousROD oh what Brendan you're just too down to earth and humble to have any FCA? Then explain THIS: https://t.co/kAAn9da4rc
I'm directing the genius @NotoriousROD 's new HBO special. Taping 12/9 in NYC. Tix are FREE. https://t.co/i1vfMg6yXX
me: you're not that hot, pilgrim. *pilgrim makes eye contact* *slowly unbuckles his hat* me: fuck.
I'm going to try to stop speaking in the second-person for a while. You should too.
@Velocipony @michaelianblack lol! Never claimed not to be a total hypocrite!!
@michaelianblack and i only replied cause I know we don't really disagree. And maybe we could actually have a convo and we did and thanks.
@michaelianblack all good man, I'm in a bad place about all this and it's tough and I'm really angry in general
@michaelianblack and someone tweeting criticisms of trump and then saying don't take to the streets to criticize trump just makes me insane.
@michaelianblack just discouraging a certain form of expression of this thing that we are both feeling I think.
@michaelianblack I get it. But the trauma of this is still happening and people get to feel it for a bit before being told how to.
@michaelianblack *think
@michaelianblack so become disillusioned to the point where they thing political protesting generally does nothing?
@michaelianblack but did you think you were "generally achieving nothing"? Expression is meaningful. If not, why are you tweeting all day?
@michaelianblack @LoreneScafaria BUT POLITICAL PICTURE BOOKS ON THE OTHER HAND 👍
Please, please, please can the internet get better at helping us communicate and understand each other rather than doing the exact opposite.
Too many movies about fantastic beasts, not enough about how to specifically locate them!

@JRichardson1997 you better not be being sarcastic!
@gigglechick of course i wasn't referencing the shooting. i'm referencing the DYING we're all running from and terrified of all of the time.

@RobbieAmell @Libb_Ayee I was like, "shit, Robbie is so photogenic that he somehow attracts photoshoot quality lighting in real life."
@RobbieAmell @Libb_Ayee didn't realize that that was a cardboard cut out at first and it was really creeping me out.
@FaithisBailey just called your director and he/she said, "I don't fucking need her. She plays villager #5. She is not essential."

@AndyMilonakis @CSteijlen oh internet, you're too kind!!!
@boburnham BREAKTHROUGH: "balloons" proven to be representative of the breasts of one Ann McCullen (1845-1902). Strange choice. Case closed.
@boburnham UPDATE: accumulating data pointing to "balloons" being representative of breasts. But who's breasts? I'm in for a long night.
Been in the library for hours trying to figure out the subtext to Katy Perry's "it's time to bring out the big balloons" line. No progress.
I like Lana Del Ray because she sings sad songs but also looks like she could sell you a quality jar of beeswax.

@pilotbacon if Kenny Ortega had taken off his sunglasses for him it may have come close to rivalry HSM3. #theonlytruetrilogy
@LouisPeitzman @pilotbacon the curtain dropping at the end of the movie is a meta-theatrical/cinematic masterpiece.

@PaulMcCartney @instagram @RollingStone WOW! HE'S REALLY "ARRIVED."
People throw the word "love" around a lot. And they also throw around the thing "frisbee" around a lot.
"I thought I found the connector; It's just a Reflektor. So I told my friend, Hector. Jane lied, so I had to correct her."
I'm as in to the song as anybody but we can't pretend that rhyming "connector" with "Reflektor" is cool.

A real man can admit when he's wrong. A fake man can do anything you want him to do because he's fake, so it's not much of a competition.

...I am very grateful for and proud of the 12 episodes we're were allowed to make. And thank you so much to everyone who has watched it...
For those asking, MTV airing the final 3 ZS this week, 2 on Saturday, is most certainly a sign that they won't order a second season...
@GillianJacobs thank you sweet Gillian! But, alas, I am no real boy! Mick holds that title alone.
