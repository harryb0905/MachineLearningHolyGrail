I really need to contrast between the hot &amp; cold tub, all jokes aside what are my chances of the Dolphins staff allowing me to use their amenities despite me no longer being an active player or affiliation with the club❓
Only way to visibly tell the difference is by the dorsal fin, Transient Orcas have a pointed dorsal &amp; the Resident Orca dorsal is round, you can’t see it unless you put each of the two side by side then you’d understand, to the average person they wouldn’t be able to tell. https://t.co/ZWY5wDBOD5
#ForzaNapoliSempre 🇮🇹 https://t.co/8JokiyA9lp
Transient = Savages: they eat walruses, sea lions, ALL other whales &amp; every other species of dolphin (which is weird because it takes an entire pod of Orcas to strategically separate 1 dolphin from the pack which doesn’t seem like enough to feed 1 Orca) 🤷🏿‍♂️ https://t.co/CNJ9eSPheo
