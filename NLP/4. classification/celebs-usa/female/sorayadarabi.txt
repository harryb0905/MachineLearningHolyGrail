“Experiments” and “EQ” were the top two words of #WEF18 - IMO - a sign of the times. Interestingly, EQ was coined in 1990 by renowned psychologist and Yale University president Peter Salovey. He agrees the acronym has made a comeback in #Davos CEO speeches (e.g, Dimon, Ma) https://t.co/4vtzVTzAS4
Awesome graphic included in a strong article by @mlevram re: the rise of women LPs. Still, major data point missing: how many of those female investing partners (the 1/14) have carry of significance in their fund? A top valley recruiter told me far fewer than we think. https://t.co/MWJK1gNGNS

Key learning at #WEF18: from @AdamMGrant : sound of voice and tone may be a better predictor for interpreting emotion than reading facial expression. Maybe social media communities could generate more empathy if sound played a larger role vs. simple text. https://t.co/NlnTiR8AI3

@TheStalwart History remembers Dan Quayle as hating on single moms and spelling badly.
@adamludwin I once heard him attribute his success to being the “CEO” Chief education officer. All of his Co founders were teachers - they believe in top down sharing and empathetic listening.
Jamie Dimon on a recent real estate summit he attended / hosted of the worlds’ most successful real estate titans. All white men he said. “Horrible.” Worst representation but venture funds are equally bad. - #WEF18
Take care of your mind, body, soul. It’s important. Take care of yourself before work and children. - Jamie Dimon on the importance of wellness  - it correlates with success. #WEF18
Jamie Dimon: in the future we will work 3.5 days a week in America, and it will be fine. - #WEF18
Jamie Dimon on JPM success + management: review every department every month. Have a disciplined detailed follow up list. Follow through. Upgrade people. Be honest with yourself about your own performance. At the end of the day success is all about the people. “Your army.” #WEF18

Common themes at #WEF18 on the future of work: equality in the workforce/how men + women can align, empathy, our aging population, public-private partnerships in this climate, scaling despite consolidation, smart nations, AI/ automation of jobs + to “co-bot” (coexist with robots) https://t.co/uPFUor6NQv
Summary: ‘We need an culture of courage. For women in the workforce. For seniors, for the young, for those seeking purpose.’ “Fear of job elimination is an old fear.  Generational. It’s 500 years old, this fear repeats itself. Different jobs appear.” @CathyEngelbert #WEF18
On #futureofwork panel at #WEF18 : CEO asks “what does the future of retail look like in a post Amazon Go era?” Rhetorical question.
@CathyEngelbert is the first woman CEO of @Deloitte, managing 75K. On #futureofwork she says “I prefer saying the work of the future” because there WILL be work. Gen D is looking forward to the future. 66% of grammar school kids will have a job that doesn’t exist today.”
Meeting with #blockchain genius @jenzhuscott.  She said. “the difference between wanting and deciding is that you can want something from your sofa. When you decide on something it requires concrete action. Resolve to want less and act more.” #WEF18 https://t.co/xi4DT4xsNL
