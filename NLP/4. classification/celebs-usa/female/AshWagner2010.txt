Guys I don’t like ice dance anymore. That was fast.
You guys I LOVE ice dance..who knew!?!! #4CC2019
I’m a sucker for Romeo and Juliet 😍 #4CC2019

That knee slide though!! #4CC2019
Starry Night is just pure art!! I’m in love with all of the little moments @PiperGilles and @PaulDPoirier create! #4cc2019

Question to literally anyone: Can being Miss North Carolina be a full time job? Feels like that’s just a year long stint for the resume..
I am all for a man being in touch with his feelings and such...but is Colton always almost crying?
I cannot listen to a full season talking about this man’s maidenhood. #TheBachelor
Demi “she’s so brave for admitting she’s 30” I AM DEAD #TheBachelor
Chances of them actually knowing who Nick Offerman or Megan Mullally are...slim #TheBachelor

Is a pinky promise and a thumb bite a thing? Asking for a friend #TheBachelor
I relate to this girl sitting on the couch complaining about talking to Colton with her cutlets hanging out on a spiritual level
Oh my god stop proposing people
Surprise twist, Australia girl keeps up the accent until hometowns, Colton finds out at the airport when they don’t fly to Sydney
Lucy gets the final rose #TheBachelor
Real talk where do I get these pink couches?
This woman is absolutely Alyssa Edwards. I’m convinced.
SINCE SHE WAS 12!? Girrrrlll
This is ABC proving to us that you can find love on the Bachelor...I’m not fooled
ABC getting this poor girl to call her mom in Federal Prison..this girl is making it to hometowns for sure so Colton can meet her imprisoned mother
Chances of her bringing this picture of her and Colton to the first night...100%
Is this the most dramatic season we’ve ever seen yet?
I’m this hilarious sober 💁🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/ORYjxBFbZX

@realdetective Thank god for this level of support. I got scolded by someone for calling it terrible...and that was what I ended up with after deciding against calling it a trash fire so you can't win them all.
So on that note, good night to whoever I've managed to offend by trying to just move on with my life tonight. XOXO Ash
The 2018 Olympic version of myself was def not my most clear minded and compassionate, I can admit that! That being said, I think in developing a new relationship with skating I'm here 2 really just try 2 help bring some humanity and understanding into the athletes stories now!
The only place I'm inconsistent is on the ice lol. Program layout is the bones of a program. Choreography connects everything, it's what gives a program style and identity, at least that's how I see it. Style preference is different for everyone, but I was looking at the bones! https://t.co/4nAFU31Hkk
Lastly, woman to woman, I apologize for calling you sweetie. You’re right it’s absolutely insidious 🤭 https://t.co/xnZs9YfUOs
Program layout is not choreo or costuming...so before you climb up on your soap box, please try to understand what I was talking about. The world does need more role models but I’m also allowed to stick up for myself when someone points a finger at something that isn’t accurate. https://t.co/xnZs9YfUOs
You bring up a great point. I’m a public figure but I’m also a real person with opinions that maybe not everyone likes. My main goal on social is to never put something out that I wouldn’t say to someone’s face! I also think that my headspace around the Olympics wasn’t my best. https://t.co/xnZs9YfUOs
I was just confused bc what I said about Jason had nothing to do with him, not because of your English! It felt very out of the blue for me reading it. I can’t speak anything other than English so props to you! That is impressive. https://t.co/VvfUjh1DRY
I was just commenting on Jason because I was very excited for him. I think it’s important 2 know you can compliment one athlete without taking away from another. OBVIOUSLY Yuzu is someone to be respected in this sport, he has accomplished more than anyone else in this generation! https://t.co/VvfUjh1DRY
Girl what? https://t.co/yUzrijGG2P
Listen up queens... https://t.co/A90lQpv9Ld
Bahahahaha https://t.co/woAjU2ma9r
Oh sweetie. I'll always think a program with all the jumps at the end is unbalanced..which is why they changed the rules this year so I wasn't too far off! I will always admit she is incredibly technically gifted! https://t.co/iNQlHUsLTG
@vmstagemom I don't understand ice dancing so I won't even attempt to comment on it
I'll wrap this up here, but never forget, figure skating is V hard and we all need a lot more kindness in the world.
I really love how Marin Honda moves. I think she's so interesting to watch. I absolutely HATE that she pops jumps. Such a talent that wastes silly points! I want her to skate clean because selfishly, I really just love watching her on the ice.
Jason is the proof that skating is not dead and we don't have to be forced to accept sloppy quad attempts being rewarded. He was clean and smooth and REWARDED...bless the skating gods have served us a performer who gets points for it.
My heart broke for the Russian pair team. I actually really loved their program, and just missing the final is absolutely gut wrenching.
Rika for Olympic champion. I'm calling it now.
Evgenia is still queen. I think this year is mentally so completely different than anything she's ever known, and we all have to just sit back and wait for her to figure it all out, because she absolutely will. She's got longevity, and this will take some time.
Nathan is actually the only person who could train with a Skype coach, take on an Ivy League education and still be able to get through a long program. I'm currently unable to go eat the rest of my Thai food bc its too far away. So, there's some perspective for you all.
I never need to live through that day of short programs ever again. That was stressful and desolate all in one. I needed a full glass of wine to help myself calm down from all the stress bangs and flyaways I saw.
The French pair team's long program is my always mood and I never want to see Vanessa in anything other than a catsuit ever again. We are all but peasants beside her.
Ok, let's talk figure skating real quick...
Does anyone else feel like they've aged a million years after watching this last Grand Prix?
But @GraceEGold who gets to be Whitney and who's Mariah? https://t.co/YzLPI5QQlZ

For anyone who's a little curious about what I've been up to...https://t.co/67nlhwaWtQ

His talent was so much more than just being an athlete. He constantly amazed me with his capabilities and his passions in life. Denis, you were taken too soon from us. I think the entire community in in shock from this, and this loss will be felt for quite a while. https://t.co/3cY5PsZoOd
Today, the world lost a bright star. Denis was not only incredibly talented, but also the kind of athlete where his kindness and light was felt way beyond the rink. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his friends and all the people that he made smile. You are missed. https://t.co/46oNfGBQQt
@bcoley02 @starsonice Girl I didn’t fall in act one 😂
Setting the bar high @Bumble and @LAClippers. Excited to see more teams adopt the empowerment badge. #teambumble #strongerwithher https://t.co/PdRaGC2mES
Ok buddy, time for a lesson in history. I've got a world medal that I earned since that Olympics. I've produced quite a lot through my hard work. After 22 years in this sport, and over a decade being spent at the elite level, I think I have earned a little me time so shush💋 https://t.co/W2PTaiRUd0
The cast of Stars on Ice wants to hear from you!  Send us a short (5 sec) video to @starsonice and tell us what you love most about the Olympics. Your video could be selected and featured in this year’s Stars On Ice “The Olympic Celebration” Tour!! 🤞
I am confident that she will head into this competition and shine the way she always does, and wish all of the US ladies the best of luck at Worlds!
In preparing to take a step back, I notified my training mate, Mariah Bell, that I was not planning on taking the alternate spot should I be called in so that she could prepare and be ready for Worlds, just in case.
A few months ago, I made the choice to listen to my heart and body and take an intentional period of rest away from skating, closing out this season. This time of heart healing has been essential, and not rushing the process is just as essential.
Also after @QueerEye I am changed. Team Tom forever. Just trying to keep you all up to date on just how crazy wild my life is 💋
I've had a lot of free time lately, and I have a lot of questions for the world. Specifically, how do I become a world famous blogger so I can go on all of the @REVOLVE escapades? Orrr what does K beauty essence really do? Real talk. It makes you wonder 😜
Hey Bumble, I've got a lot of strong women in my hive who taught me we are all created equal! So excited to watch this grow! https://t.co/jwSs6lkqcO
It’s not just what I get to do at the rink that I love. It’s also moments like these. Thank you to @Bridgestone for giving me the opportunity to hang out with these little athletes. Check out how your little one can win a chance to meet me or another fellow U.S. Olympian! https://t.co/UIR02n65rR
@shayz0rz I am shooketh
Twitter, y'all are crazy. Love you lots, but you're crazy. https://t.co/sj87onYWyz
All of this was said before the individual event and I have time and time again complimented her technical prowess and acknowledged the success of her strategy. It wasn't an "emotional moment" it was an opinion and let it be just that! Nothing more or less was meant by it! https://t.co/rMjfKivLhc
So, everyone is entitled to their opinions but I have an endless amount of respect for any athlete that can lay it down under the pressure of the Olympics, and I'll never find it my place to take away from that moment. Congrats to our young champ, it's an amazing accomplishment!
It is a system that my sport has created and it allows for programs like this. They are amazing technical feats, I just think it kills the artistry that I love in figure skating. Watching a young athlete achieve Olympic gold is something I have so much respect for!
I am getting all of these responses to my comment about Zagitova, so I'll reiterate what I said one last time. I don't   think backloading leads to a very artistic or balanced program, I just don't. I also can't do a program with all of my jumps at the end and find it impressive
Just discovered Oprah's "Super Soul Conversations" and I'm loving it! So great for anyone feeling a little lost and needing some life inspo!

The Olympics are about more than a medal sometimes. Our team got to see Mirai land a triple axel, Bradie crush it and help get that team medal and Karen live put her Olympic dream. Congrats to these ladies on turning the Olympics into their reality. Don't forget that people. 💋
@SadGalLaurie 🤷🏼‍♀️
@demonlyforever That didn't happen sooooo I'll just let you know it's Mirai* instead I guess 💁🏼‍♀️
And I'll wrap it up with this for our top three ladies of the night who KILLED IT! https://t.co/6hZ0CzSLmm
I will add this though. https://t.co/T50TGSTRZZ
Welp. Thats about all I've got to say after that!

Some phenomenal skates with the ladies today! @kaetlyn_23 was the shining star of this event for me! Also a very impressive start for Zagitova, we will see what happens in the long...
Can we talk about Kaitlyn Weaver's new costume? It's so good. She's a goddess.
Seattle, Portland, and Spokane are some stops with @starsonice this year! Come see usssssss https://t.co/fsbi7j9PqI
He did. We are all blessed. He's a busy babe https://t.co/yThtGc0lwm
I'll meet u in the middle bebe. First, the tone police don't exist outside of an actual conversation. Second, perhaps my opinion can seem harsh, but no athlete is ever tagged and I always respect their own individual approach 2 competition, but that doesn't mean I have to like it https://t.co/Mtw7etkmWu
I answer because people need to see that words absolutely hurt, but only if you let them. If you call them out on their negativity and shine the light back on them they usually don't know what to do with it. Can I hang with your dog too though? https://t.co/BffQjrNtXN
No, they aren't bad, they just don't lead to a very intricate program. It's a way to gain speed that isn't very taxing, it's just not as difficult. The jumps he does are insane but there is room for more. https://t.co/aqGwqpJUjG
Very true. She's a force to be reckoned with as she is now. Give her time and she will absolutely flourish artistically https://t.co/ZqYNEpgSNg
I simply offer my opinion which I can back up with facts. I'm so supportive of athletes living out their Olympic dream, it is incredible. I also have a preference in skating style which is all mine and no one else's. I'm sorry if you find it rude, I come from an honest place https://t.co/GAMcmLOai8
I will remember youuuuuu 🎵🎶🎵 https://t.co/49oeizc9Xx
I just feel the other boys had more to offer for their programs as a whole. Boyang has phenomenal jumps, but doesn't have as intricate a program in my eyes. The boys finished appropriately I think! https://t.co/sROoj3UPyv
Again, I already did sooooo that can't be too accurate 😬 https://t.co/0xWzxYAcIo
But you are reading my tweets soooooo 😁 https://t.co/hecn2BpWiy
Whoops I already did! https://t.co/ol7W2sTZIa
Yikes Richie. https://t.co/cMGOaZpKIu
But baby I was born this way! https://t.co/zZYayTRyMS
I understand, but there are just no transitions in the program. I don't mean for it to be mean, it's just how I see it. Technically he's strong, but as we saw today there needs to be more than technique to get into the podium. https://t.co/9WtgOVWsRV
It's our basic way of gaining speed in skating. You'll usually see people doing them skating backwards around a corner https://t.co/pq79lsdTx6
THANK YOU SHOMA
YES BABE
Please Shine. Crossovers can't medal at the #olympics
You all know my love for Shoma.
I appreciate a good flowy shirt tbh.
See what I did there?
Ohhhhhhhhh Javi saw the door open and is ready to Skate through it maybe??
The people in front of me are so hyped and keep apologizing. They don't realize how much i appreciate them and wish I could get on their level
So am I. https://t.co/f5J2nOciB8
Thats how you win the #olympics
Ok I won't even comment on what is about to go down.
Got that @SamsungUS battery 👐 https://t.co/T5uFGgw1R7
I'm at 83% baby! https://t.co/T5uFGgw1R7
Beautiful. Simply beautiful.
Honestly I can watch Patrick just do crossovers and I'd be happy. I know I I know you guys but it's different.
Holding my breath bc that's all I'm in control of right now
Oh a cowl neck
Patrick ARE YOU WITH US TONIGHT???
THAT WAS SO CLOSE!
Crossovers.
Great skate. One mistake but other than that solid. I just wish he would have done more crossovers. K I'm done I swear. Really I'm done I mean it.
Me during this program. https://t.co/s9poOG8jOW
The force is with him tonight.
More crossovers. I can't wait.
Up next, Star Wars. That's all.
Aliev looking like he's hurting from that fall. Ok he's fighting but you can tell that second fall got him.
Ok this warm-up is sloppy. I feel like we're going to see Nathan rising up in the ranks today 💁🏼‍♀️
But, male modesty 😂 https://t.co/TfzrWflxQL
I am so proud. @Adaripp was injured in a boot this time last year. He came out tonight and showed everyone hard work, determination and a touch of fabulosity will get you far. I love you so much and I'm so amazed by you.
This top is SO GOOD AMIRITE
Babe is next brb freaking out.
I hear this music every day back home but it sounds SO GOOD in an Olympic venue
I want you all to know that my stress bangs are out of control today https://t.co/4Db0mbjCXp
I guess I could ask for some rotations. THIS GUY CAN BE SO GOOD WHEN HES ON!
What do they with the Russian judges here? I'm curious if they are impacted by the ban or not and I haven't heard anything about it!
Sparkle belt. Purple accesory fabric. Elvis. I guess I can't ask for much more from Kolyada
Chills. What a great moment for our guy!!!! First showing at the #Olympics and he was in control the entire time. WOW @govincentzhou
This tech score is going to be bonkers for @govincentzhou if he keeps this up 👊👊👊
Just a casual quad.
You know I'm here for a Moulin Rouge moment!
VINCENT 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
We're pretty tight now 💁🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/X1WfCJNb82
He's also a cat.
Fun fact...Keegan Messing taught me everything I know about yoyo tricks when we were kids. #TheMoreYouKnow
Also I'm baaaaaaacccckkkkkkk 😈
I like Jorik's skating! He's really solid and can pull you into a performance.
Who's ready for this group of boyz???
YAAAAASSSS Nathan! That's the athlete I know 👐
@jillpainter @Jackie_Pepper @bethharrisap @jojolats @helenenothelen @AlanSpringer @YSportsEvan @carolynmanno @TomGoldmanNPR @NPRmelissablock @Adaripp @mirai_nagasu Check your DMs!

Before I get myself in anymore trouble I'm gonna wrap this up. AMAZING men's short today. We will see who makes moves in the long!
Fair 💁🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/v451wzbFXk
But at least I'm in the building 💋 https://t.co/lGa7MSWiYH
@betty_boo94 Nope! The man is a cat. He can land just about anything! So great tonight 👏
@KacKelly It works really really well for him, he pulls the style off!
Great technical program from Boyang
Great quad from Boyang. This music is almost making me forget that all he does is crossovers. And chill all I ever did was crossovers too
@team_pdd @Debsplaining THE PANTS
@vesperteacup Absolutely was!
I love Javi his skating is incredible. I just have a hard time getting into super schticky programs
104.17 from Shoma Yuzu should be feeling pretty comfy with that
Shoma 😍😍😍
I love how exciting the quads are, but unless these guys go out and do them like Yuzu it's hard to watch. It gets sloppy real quick
I'm getting the feeling this last group will be sloppy. These guys are going for technical elements that are just so risky
Poor guy. Training with him he's such a hard worker. Great kid. There's just so much pressure he's under. He .might have dug himself into a hole that is too deep
This one is going to hurt him. A could of huge mistakes.
Down on the quad lutz, he just needs to hold it together now.
This is such a good program for Nathan. It gives him maturity and style.
It's a tough position to put Nathan in but he's tuning out the noise and staying focused
This score is going to be INSANE
I love his axel entrance. You never see it coming and it's so dynamic
Textbook perfect quad. You can't ask for anything better
Yuzu up first. I'm ready for this place to go insane
And now the chase for the podium begins!!!
I haven't seen this kid skate before. I really think he's got some potential if the tech gets worked out
We have a Lambiel program up next. This will be good
Hava Nagila at the Olympics representing Israel. The crowd is into it
This is about to be the most Jewish thing we've ever seen and I love it.
So many Winnie the Pooh things are getting prepped and ready for their Olympic moment
Second mark pushes him up as it really should he deserves it. That axel though!!!😬
K I apparently curse people when I praise them
Perfect lutz toe. This is such an ooey gooey  good program
Nails the first quad
We are all just dust in the wind.
HUGE SCORE for Dimitri! 98.98
Ok which Chiddy are we getting today? He could EASILY take control of this event right now if he lays it down. Best men's skating skills out there.
K I'm loving this costume with this music. Such great Olympic music..
Wow great quad combo to start with Aliev
I'm shaking he was awesome
Mesh. Shoulders. Sass. Glamazon and she's ready for her runway. Who's ready for @Adaripp
Technically he's throwing it down. Yikes just as I typed that he went down the axel. The quads should hold him up a bit though
Great quad combo to start
Danny...a young talent let's see what he does
Je suis malade we are all deathly ill after Jorik. DRAMA. I love it
Misha serving up a lot of dramatic face touches and giving us feels. Nice triple axel 💁🏼‍♀️
Paul Fentz is giving me some Javi vibes.
@WeaverPoje You're right I'm v alive 💁🏼‍♀️
Just watched Aliona and Bruno's long. What a MOMENT. I have chills. My cold dead heart might finally be feeling things? I don't know. I am changed. Ugh. So good.
@Ladybugs96 Yikes girl, right back at ya!
@HousewivesTWTS @Bridgestone Because I'm an Olympic medalist 😘
I appreciate this. https://t.co/MmKPbsH1Dy
En route to the men's short program. Y'all. Get ready for some live tweeting. It's about to go down.
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. I know why she had a tutu, I'm just starting a conversation about the choice in costume because it's not traditional for figure skating. No need to be snarky, it also comes off a little ignorant 😌 https://t.co/KZAQVbAyw5
Hi all. This woman is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥 watch her take over the universe today. We aren't worthy. https://t.co/mOZMY3OyFE
A proper glo-up if I ever saw one @guskenworthy https://t.co/wYQLKvRxKi
Great stone glide. Smooth and steady and also on one of the circles. @NBCOlympics I'm available if you need my professional commentary
Currently watching curling, and tbh I don't get it. These guys are all v chill though and I can appreciate that
I know you're just trolling, but also, true 💁🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/qhtqpyb5Ri
Well I'm not actually at home...how funny! https://t.co/Xu9ZB9j6d1
Hardly envious I absolutely cannot handle a program that technically difficult at the end! It's impressive but I just prefer a bit less of a chaotic second half! https://t.co/y5f1yjeBQ3
Oh the tone police have arrived! You won't get very far with that argument. Not criticizing, as an athlete I totally respect what she's doing! A shining star in this event ⭐⭐⭐ https://t.co/b8YBq59kBc

@BikiniPromote I actually hadn't seen it yet! Love the Julia gif though
I absolutely agree it's a strategy, she works the system like I've said before. It's not criticizing her she's using this to her advantage. I just don't enjoy it as much as a whole program though. I find back loaded programs very empty in the front and too chaotic at the end. https://t.co/SnsVGUq05z
Points on points. It's the system and she's working it, you can't blame her it works
Ok. I respect the competitive approach. But no cannot do this set up. It's not a program. She killed time in the beginning and then just jumped the second half. It's not a performance. I understand that this is what the system allows but it's not all figure skating is about
Technically so perfect.
She's going to do seven jumps in the second half.
When is she going to jump....
I'm watching with a snowboarder and feel like I have to explain the tutu on behalf of my sport.
Classic tutu. Thoughts?
K this is the girl to watch. She could snatch the crown this games
134. 134. One thirty four. I guess that's all I have to say?
Hi all. If you mean tweet me you get blocked. You no longer exist to me after that so I guess bye?
Keep me humble. I can't forget my roots https://t.co/McUZFgXeBP
Replaying the triple axel right now. So solid. This girl can't be stopped. What a cool story.
I do want to give her just like a spray of hair spray so bad though
Ladies have been really strong so far it'll be interesting to see what they do with this
Caro looking a little tight. But she's serving a flirty eye moment that's making me ok with it all
Wonky landing but she gets it done
Transitions for days. Jumps are so light
Caro is on. Girl loves a good lash and I am here for it
Looking @TeamUSA right now looking great for a medal! So excited for my teammates having this moment
Just left filming to find out that @mirai_nagasu got her axel called clean in the team comp! So proud of this girl, such an inspiration with what she has done to her career 👊👊👊
Tweeting during film breaks RN. Can we talk about how amazing @Adaripp was?!?! I see him skate like this every day and to watch him just let it happen is so refreshing
I really love her technical abilities, and she is a total performer. I just don't like the layout of this program. It feels like it's maxed out for points and less for the moment it could create! Still so incredible to watch her.
TEXTBOOK
Quiet all. The queen is taking her turn.
ABSOLUTELY NOT. That shouldn't have gone in front of Bradie unless I'm missing something. I get the second mark but still.
Russians in the house cheering on their girl Evgenia. This place is going to blow if she skates the way we know she can
Hi all. Phone is dying. It'll make it for Evgenia. Miss you all already.
Nerves are a thing here. Such a powerhouse but it can get out of control  if you're not careful
I love this program for satoko. It keeps her beautiful and elegant but makes her sharp and strong as well
Caro is one of those skaters that just makes you want to go out and skate. My favorite performer of all time. A level of skating we cannot lose in this sport.
Dabin. Ombre on point. Bell sleeves for days. Great skate from her. The crowd is really feeling it
Caro warming up lots of loops, Evgenia looking so solid. Osmond looks ready, I love this program of hers. Satoko is stunning as always
Group 2 is on and it's kind of insane to imagine that just about all of these girls could be a medal contender. A great preview for the individual event
Bradie was the queen we don't deserve and was so solid for @TeamUSA today in the short! Technically perfect.
Also hi from the Olympics Twitter!
It literally doesn't matter what happens put on the ice with @MBMeite she is such 🔥🔥🔥 to watch every time
@J_Butt Thanks. I'm an amazing swimmer 💁🏼‍♀️
Headed to a viewing party for tonight's Opening Ceremony? @ProcterGamble has you covered with all the essentials. Get to your local @riteaid and grab everything you need to look your best. #TeamUSA #Pyeongchang #ad
Athletes dont get to choose what the media does with them. We don't get to choose who says what about us or when. Don't go out of your way to tag me in a tweet. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, doesn't mean we need to see it! So proud of those girls and it's their time now https://t.co/arZZXOUC82
The longest convo @nathanwchen and I have ever had 😂 https://t.co/6ApKrJQHuw
Tragically, my Louboutins were stolen by my house thief. I am a girl without her red bottoms ☹ I am here for some 2014 weave action though. I want the ponytail this time though https://t.co/6QiDUVWA8E
Ok @guskenworthy I see you working that Opening Ceremony uniform 🔥🔥🔥 Love it all, might even hate love the gloves? What do you guys think?  https://t.co/lQKvwIvA77
Adulting is cute. When is our Olivia Pope wine night where we plan world domination? The white seats add a level of danger I live for💋 https://t.co/S4jK9PQ2zu

❤️ https://t.co/Ugpp7mALjt
Lastly Twitter, before you eat me alive, don't forget there is a real person on the other end of your tweets. ❤
As an athlete, I'm allowed to be mad. As a senior competitor with over 10 years of experience, I'm allowed to question things. At the end of the day, I laid out my best and I'm going home proud! Congrats to the lovely ladies of the team, you've got me in your cheering squad now!
No matter what happens. Thank you to every single person in that rink for giving me a special moment I will never forget. Thank you.
My king. All hail. https://t.co/9RMxvfSkvJ
We were told we had to sing. We went and got @Starbucks instead. Thanks for the ride @Toyota and @USFigureSkating https://t.co/IrWSILg8dw
Just so everyone knows this has been happening via candlelight https://t.co/bUJWYPcXHI
He has to leave for his Brazillian Blowout soon so we might have to get back to this at a later date
Attention @adaripp is now looking up his moon sign stay tuned
Omg he got up and I thought it was to look at the beautiful sunset now I am realizing it was for this dramatic photo https://t.co/W0kdfFKX1d
Day to day with Adam means going along with all these tangents. Which means acting genuinely surprised when he's in shock that he's not a double Scorpio for the first ten minutes, then nod supportively when he rambles on about how he's always known he was different for another 10 https://t.co/vPWzrfR0Nz
@morgan_la_faith Obviously ❤
@wranghorn I'm obviously v supportive of this and would never judge. You do you babe, grammatically correct or not.
Adam left an hour ago and I'm bored. https://t.co/HXBeq0E2Ap
Supportive Twitter post from oceans away. https://t.co/VkC2JxEDJR
Mostly because you called me kiddo. https://t.co/sRprEbUKOz
Correcting people on Twitter for their bad grammar is my FAVORITE.
A queen in our midst https://t.co/tbu6RxS7jC
I've learned from the best ❤ https://t.co/vuhRmXehOg
Haha no actually! I asked for people like you to learn how to use question marks when asking a question! Before you sass me, learn to punctuate properly 💋 https://t.co/8cIX0L04Uf
No one told me about my stress bang but this is still cute https://t.co/w3Zmo7XF8y
@ESWill09 @espn I googled it to make sure because I thought so too! 🤷🏼‍♀️
Ok, just kidding this is the last thing. Fine, you aren't so sure that skating is much of a sport bc we have costumes etc. I guess my question is at this point, just bc you have access to a keyboard are you really a journalist? Hmmm 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/WBjzyiEAHc
Oh one last thing! Since when do journalists reference Hollywood movies and act like those are the facts? Get back to me when you can actually learn how to spell OLYMPIC CHAMPION Meryl Davis's name right. Google, try it out it's fun! Again @espn SMH at all of this. https://t.co/SRsQhTonMd
Big LOL at this article. Live for ignorant male writers who take something beautiful and question if it could possibly be a sport! Put @JannyMedvedeva in a paper bag and she'll still be a kickass ATHLETE who dominates..SMH @espn at such a ridiculous article https://t.co/DtNkOjcaFj

Thank you all for distracting me from warming up. Until next time, you can find me at your nearest UPS Dropbox.
Omg. My cry for help has been answered. Thank you 👐 https://t.co/yPDprEWi9a
Ugh fine. You all are right I am wrong.
See fam, I am getting a lot of no responses but Google has told me differently. It's not that I don't believe you, it's just that the post office is on my way home from the rink...
Question to the twitter fam. Can i drop off a UPS package at the USPS? Melissa Wagner is not responding fast enough to my inquiry.
I have an unacceptable number of winter coats for living in California. Just putting that out there.
Yaaaassssssss shoulder shoulder shoulder face https://t.co/yZVyh3bCp6
@Adaripp But for real how did you get him to take a pic with you this is so cute I don't think he likes me enough to tolerate this

No excuses, nothing to say other than that I am beyond ready to close up the chapter that has been this season. You live, you learn.
Everything happens for a reason. I have been through so much this year, and without question this is just a stop on the journey.

How many times did Vanessa change her lip color!? @BachelorABC
@HarrisonChoate I'm there with you right now.
Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh.
This @BachelorABC finale is making me very excited for @helsinki_2017 Worlds!
I LOVEEEEE Raven's dress
He is building Raven up to tear her down and it's going to be terrible 🙈
Nick's sweaters are criminal. He looks like a renaissance queen with that collar #BachelorNation
PUPPIES!!!!!!!!
Maybe the cutest skating date of all time. Boys take note 💁🏻 @BachelorABC
Sad crying on a last date is not a good sign.
Vanessa has very clearly never watched the bachelor #BachelorNation
Vanessa is committing to the non-zip with this jacket situation. I'm impressed. Also cold. #BachelorNation
What is happening!? How can you have a safari in the snow. Why is Santa here!? #BachelorNation
It's Bachelor night. Tonight, we get to watch Nick choose between two women, and he doesn't like either of them. This is going to be great🙌🏻
@b_ridgeb @ChristineC2387 No you are so right and I am so sorry for this current struggle of yours 💁🏻

But he had to break up with her during rush hour. Nick, low blow.
For the first time ever, I think I actually like Corinne
Ah there's so much traffic! How awkward!? Ugh poor girl
Okay agree or disagree. I totally thought he was keeping Corinne around his long just for the fantasy suite 🙈 I'm amazed she's going home
Corrine brushed her hair today. This is a big deal. Downside, she showed up in a loin cloth. You can't win them all. #bachelor
NICK YOU'VE MADE ME TOLERATE YOU FOR TOO MANY WEEKS DONT SAY YOU DONT HAVE TO PICK A GIRL. YOU DO!! @BachelorABC
Meanwhile Nick is nice and warm inside talking about his feelings #bachelor
Okay I'm mad at this rose ceremony. First one in forever and they make them freeze outside. I'd be so mad. I'd need to show off my dress
Brb for the next couple hours. Can't wait to sit and watch Nick not find his true love for the fourth time 😅😭😭😭 #bachelor

Ponytail/man bun power? I can't keep up
This kid. Such a star
Shoma. What happened to your hair?
@rockerskating We need to know
I do feel like whoever is singing his music is screaming at me though
So this kid can skate 💁🏻
No prob. Two
Oh. Wow. One down
Marissa says she thinks her boot size is bigger that Shoma's...accurate?
YASSS QUEEEEENNNN
K. Back. He's an angel and we are not worthy
Okay commentary on pause you all understand.
Beautiful performance from Sergei! One of my fav Russian men!

@realdetective FOR REALZ!?
Omg push kid you're too young to go that slow
Sassy dancing I love it 💃🏻
Solid combo
I'll be honest I'm mentally screaming at him to push faster into every jump
Dicey but there
Nam and the sparkle belt. Let's go noodle
Shoma knows all about a good ombré amirite!?
Alright people #GetUp and cheer for our boys!!!!!! #SkateAmerica
Great score for Boyang! Four quads is impressive no matter how you slice it #SkateAmerica
I am the queen of no transitions, but Boyang surpassed me today #SkateAmerica
But four no problem 💁🏻
Third time is not the charm today
Ooooh goofy flirty clown, oh and back to a million crossovers
Boards babe. Don't jump on them.
And that's two...
Huge. One down
Color blocking on point
How many quads are we about to see? Any guesses?
