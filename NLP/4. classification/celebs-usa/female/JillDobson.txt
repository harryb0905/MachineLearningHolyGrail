Who makes #Spartans prouder: Journalism master's grad Jill Dobson or Jalen Watts-Jackson? (Hint: The winner gets it by a TD. And isn't me.)
It's been 17 years since I lived in Alabama. And yet I just turned to my coughing kids and asked, "Are y'all OK?"
Me: "Women's sizes are crazy. My skirt this morning was Size 2. These jeans are Size 8." @RandyYeip: "Sheesh! What'd you have for lunch?!"
In grad school, @RandyYeip said the funniest thing anyone has ever said to me...
My spellcheck doesn't recognize the word Prosecco. I'm like, "Hello iPhone!! Have we met?!" #Bubbly

How I spent my summer vacation: https://t.co/4mmqDSQBKU
...but then I dropped pizza on the gown. #Oops #DoIHaveToBuyItNow?
...Later I covered the Primetime Emmys red carpet in a borrowed designer gown. And it felt so right! #CableNewsSalary
...But it was black, so I thought maybe that helped. But I'm not sure that it did! #LocalNewsSalary
I once attended the Daytime Emmys with my now-husband (then-boyfriend) and I was so poor I wore an old cotton sundress from The Limited...
Apparently it's National Thrift Shop Day. So I've got Macklemore on repeat. Also, I'm wearing your granddad's clothes.
Whenever I see cast members from "Downton Abbey" in modern clothes, I get really upset.

In a shocking turn, my daughter asked me to turn off Jewel's "Twinkle, Twinkle" and sing it myself. Poor baby is clearly tone-deaf. @jeweljk
I'm trying to Jedi-mind-trick @GwynethPaltrow into believing that we're best friends. #MayTheForceBeWithMe

That's how I felt at Fox News, @elielandau! "Who's walking toward me? @HeatherFoxNews? @CourtneyFriel? Oh. I'm just approaching a mirror."
@TheView, I'm watching at the gym- wearing yoga pants; listening to Madonna during breaks. I'm LIVING the Hot Topics. Or you're stalking me.
@ZachSelwyn - I suggest you talk to @JimOrnstein about your cards and Judah Friedlander about your hats!
...My TiVo keeps telling me to watch "Fifty Shades of Tina Fey" and "Fifty Shades of Bobby Flay," which is making me laugh. Hungrily. @bflay
On the one hand, I'm mad at my TiVo because it failed to record @TheView yesterday so I missed @StacyLondon and @WhoopiGoldberg. However...

@Deannaee I don't have the dexterity for that! Or the time- because I'm spending it all shopping at TRDO (Trampy Red Dress Outlet). Clearly.
@aliciar The upside: You never dine alone!
Closet-shopping on #GoRedForWomen day. Now, which is most appropriate for preschool pick-up? http://t.co/V6BDv04jHd
Gotta love @FreshDirect- I just completed my weekly grocery shopping while playing hide-and-seek with my kids. #SendingThisFromUnderTheBed
@Rabiddogg Thanks, dude! You're awesome at many things, too!
Look who's on @RedEye tonight, debating whether Katy Perry is hot or super hot. Tune in! http://t.co/uJaHo2Mkob
@BillSchulz "If you come here for game, you need to bring chilled Veuve Clicquot." Look, these aren't my rules, these are VANDERPUMP rules.
My winter fun recipe: two kids with the flu + hundreds of NYC pharmacies out of flu meds or closed due to snow. Martha Stewart, I am not.
I love watching @klgandhoda  - especially when @billybush shows up to prank Hoda and @JimOrnstein! #LavenderSweater
Emma Stone- this Cabaret crowd has Bon Jovi, Ali Wentworth &amp; George Stephanopoulos. Maybe you'll get mentioned on GMA! Or in a Jovi ballad.
No pressure, Emma Stone, but nit only am *I* in the audience of Cabaret tonight, but Jon Bon Jovi is here too!
@aliciar It was in Westchester for Julie &amp; Julia. Sony "forgot" to reimburse me, but I met Meryl, Amy Adams and... Danny Castellano!
Amount I once spent on cab fare to get to a Meryl Streep interview: $100. Five minutes with Oscar's most-nominated actress: Priceless.
Big day for Kevin Hart: I might discuss @KevinHart4real on #RedEye. Which I'm sure is a much bigger deal to him than today's Ellen segment.
I'm watching gorgeous @CourtneyFriel on #RedEye and thinking I have a LOT to do before my appearance tomorrow. Do I have time for lipo?
Thanks for all the fun comments, dear #RedEye viewers! I needed some cheering up since I'm in LAST PLACE in my bracket pool. Darn you, Duke!
Tonight on RedEye (Fox News, 3am): Lindsay Lohan scoop, NCAA bracket fun, and.... (drumroll, please)... me!
Dear @GregoryDobson, I've never beaten you at anything in my life. Perhaps the Twitterverse is aiming to correct that. Thanks, Twitterverse!
@aliciar Best quote from Miley: “I think water’s, like, a really important thing.”
Yes, @romanov_76_110! @aliciar made me return &amp; the first thing I stumbled upon was @AlissaHenryTV's kind tweet. Is Twitter always this fun?
Fun weekend idea: Have some enchiladas and then see @spinplatesmovie - or go to it on an empty stomach like me and spend two hours drooling!
If @GregGutfeld's birthday wish is to hang out with me, then he's a lucky boy! I'm visiting him on the #RedEye set tonight. Join us!
We had a baby girl! How do you like her name in comparison to North West and Prince George? http://t.co/dSdLdk9UdM

If I ever get a dog, I'm totally naming him Mark RUFFalo.
I love seeing random tweets like this, @ShannonPoe! You're awesome, too!
@courtneyfriel My parents called to tell me they saw @CarterEvans on CBS! They were so excited!
Loved catching up with friends @janicedeanfox &amp; @heatherfoxnews today! Point of clarification: By "catching up with" I mean "watching on TV"
Please say HI to all my fellow Michiganders while you're performing in Detroit this week, @ConstantineM! In return, they'll ALL attend J&amp;H!

The best part of the new #Twilight movie? When @aliciar yelled "cheater!" at the screen during Bella's final onscreen moment. #NeverForget
Who needs a "Hang in There" poster? Instead, my friends are getting a calendar with an anti-affirmation-a-day. #ThinkNegative // @BowmanInc
If you think anything pleases me more than eggnog, online gift shopping and a @hallmarkchannel holiday movie...you don't know me at all!
Your 15-month old could teach a lot of New Yorkers a thing or two, @AbiDobson. Does he also refrain from hocking loogies on the sidewalk?
What do you mean #RedEye's Bill isn't funny, @ShimmerBlue22? I laugh every time I even LOOK at him. I laugh AT him. Not with him, of course.
Every picture my husband has ever taken of me has been blurry. Either he's a terrible photographer or I'm part vampire.
Sure! Where do I tune in? // RT USATODAYlife Want to watch a mediocre show about male models posing as firefighters?
My only criticism of Kathie Lee and Hoda is that they don't drink enough.

You HAVE TO tune in to #RedEye for tonight's @Mickey_Rourke segment. Hilarious, if you can overlook @BillSchulz's presence. #PowerMiddle
You weren't complaining when I used my connections to get us Letterman tickets, @BowmanInc! (Oh, wait, those were *your* connections.)
Yes! His name is @BillSchulz and he's horrible. // RT @suwannn6: @JillDobson do you have a boyfriend?

Just so everyone knows...ditto! // RT @aliciar: Just so everyone knows I'm wearing Target while watching the Emmys on my couch.
I think we all know which carpet *I'd* end up on! Sigh. // RT @APEntertainment There's THE red carpet &amp; a parallel one for the less famous.
Oh my goodness, Coach's Wife looks amazing! #Emmys #FridayNightLightsForever  #ConnieBritton
I feel that way about Honey Boo Boo. // RT @BowmanInc I never heard about Mike Birbiglia until a month ago. I liked it better that way.
Is that water or whiskey? If the latter, drink up! //RT @aliciar: @UnitedWater says the brown water in Hoboken is safe. http://t.co/O37D4lI7
If you had one question for PRINCE, what would it be? I'm discussing the Little Red Corvette singer on HLN's Showbiz Tonight!
I wish Ted were hosting! Or Stewie. Or Peter Griffin. // RT @EW Seth MacFarlane hosts tonight's SNL.
If you met stars @tthasselbeck &amp; @ehasselbeck, would you ask about their fascinating lives OR miss the fun by napping? Friend wants to know.
Thanks! I forgot to say I also got in shape doing Daisy-endorsed pilates DVDs! // RT @DanielDonnelly: @showbiztonight @daisyfuentes awesome!
Hobo Correspondent! Finally, the perfect title for @BillSchulz! // RT @troublesoup Bill Schulz is the best hobo correspondent...
On HLN's @showbiztonight, I'll talk about Jessica Simpson's baby weight, and my own! Also Ryan Reynold's abs, and my own (or lack thereof)!
Home decor so affordable, @BillSchulz might even try it in his cardboard box! http://t.co/HQ4cYgM4
I thought you said "The Grudge" look. You know, hair in the face, demonic glint in the eye. // RT @KellyanneDignan "The grunge" look is back
@BillSchulz Don't even get me started on your illegitimate daughter, Lunestra!
Yes! To @BillSchulz...in my dreams. And by "dreams," I mean nightmares. // RT @suwannn6: @JillDobson Are you married or not
I like to think I'm clever. But compared to this @EW piece http://t.co/PYyJ51UD, my writing is as hollow and pointless as @BillSchulz. :(
Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes! My kitchen cabinets will soon be Warhol-ier than thou! // RT @tamaragitt Campbell channels Andy Warhol...

I wish I'd been at the @TylerHilton show too, @Ashley8053! But I had to be home for SOMEBODY's 7:45pm bedtime. (Mine!)
So happy Bill &amp; @GiulianaRancic will soon have Baby. If they name it Shane, I've got tons of custom hats, bibs, blankets to share! /@aliciar
Everybody, avoid the bathroom here! A man just asked his kid, "You need to go #1 or #2?" The kid shouted urgently, "Number eight!" Yikes.
I'm still recovering from how gross Candy Cigarettes were! Terrible idea! // RT @LeniseLigon Woman sells "meth-inspired" candy.
Just had a vivid dream that I'm filling in as co-host of @KLGandHoda this morning! Running over to NBC studios now, in case it was real!
You're right, @LLSKYGIRL. My deepest apologies to Ellen. I *wish* I were half as successful as a talk show host... with a Cover Girl deal!
Mine's @BillSchulz! // RT @christinahonan: Everyone has a guy friend who looks like Ellen Degeneres.
Thanks, @5thRing!
Thank you! Fun fact: @BillSchulz really does sit home trying to take pictures of thunder! And failing, for some reason. // RT @fcifaldi...
I'll be out there cheering you on, @byrnes22! Good luck! #NYCTriathlon
In terms of #redeye guests, I earned the bronze at best. Gold &amp; silver went to @AnthonyCumia &amp; @mcmoynihan. And @BillSchulz earned a razzie.
Tonight on #RedEye: Six hilarious people...and, oh yeah, me. But you should tune in anyway. It's 3am- what else is there to do?

Yay for you! I'll be watching! // RT @mikeogorman: We're making a Tiny Apartment TV pilot! Thanks to all the fans! http://t.co/0bqoziYX
I tried. It's impossible! RT // @BowmanInc: Gordon Ramsay just called his chefs "Muppets." Try screaming "Muppets" without laughing.
I've been removed from the #RedEye roster, hopefully just for tonight. If they ban me for life, it'll be hard to bash @BillSchulz in person.
Exactly! That's exactly what @BillSchulz smells like! // RT @TonyMuckleroy: Stale beer, Marlboro reds and Desitin?
...Not because of that, though. Because of how he smells!
TV tip: Camera only adds 10 pounds if you're next to someone skinner than you. I dread being on-cam with lanky @BillSchulz tonight! #RedEye

Watch out- Regis is taking over the airwaves! Right now @OfficialRegis is co-hosting with Kathie Lee at NBC &amp; he's the guest on Rachael Ray!
So busy with the baby, I'm just now reading an @EW mag from February. For Oscar night it suggests drinking a "dry Martini Scorsese." Ha!
Seriously? No one responded to my last tweet? Not even to mock me?! You people are too nice. God bless.
Confession: 10 years together, and I still have to think twice to spell my husband's last name. (I don't know how @shan_szczerbiak does it!)
Congratulations on your new gig, @maybeleah! Hope your salary is better than what I earn as a stay-at-home mom. I get paid in spit-up.

Definitely, @shan_szczerbiak! Should I wear awesome shoes, too?
Ha! Not your fault, @Seamless Web folks! Faulty modem/router. And, burying the lead here - I eventually got my veggie burger! #HappyEnding

I refuse to tell my husband that @NBCBFF is AWESOME because then I'd have to wait & watch with him. And I can't wait! (Sorry, sweetie!)
Hold on. There's a magazine called Baby Style? My 6-month old is looking for first haircut ideas. Now we know where to turn! @grettamonahan

I'm high on the Chicago improv world today, after my Celebrity Sighting of the Day: Tina Fey. (I SO wanted to quote 'Bossypants' to her!)
Hello Chicago! Go Bulls tonight! And Friday night, enjoy the best improv in town: http://bit.ly/m5v2tG #ILoveChicago
I love how you think! And the dust? Settled. // RT @cwoodall1 When the dust settles, my campaign for the #thejilldobsonshow is going hard!
@LeniseLigon An MSU girl in Alabama working in TV?! Who are you- me? (I went to Troy U., then grad school at MSU, then graduated to TV!)
@BowmanInc - Bowman knows best! Bring on the Bloodsuckers! Did you mean a Rob Pattinson-type, or an actual vampire? Anything for ratings!
House Arrest: Awful or Awesome? I take you INSIDE the mind of Lindsay Lohan. Click here, if you dare: http://www.thejilldobsonshow.com/
@bubbascrzy PLEASE tell me you're a high-level network exec, and you're dead serious about that!  :)
@BowmanInc Yes, Ferrari Guy is just the kind of guest to help "The Jill Dobson Show" win the Oprah audience. Thanks.
HA! // RT @Coffeehousejoe:  Industry sources confirm Oprah really left daily TV because she feared competing against "The Jill Dobson Show".
Someone (OK, me) started a grassroots effort to give someone (OK, me) her own talk show. How thoughtful!! http://www.thejilldobsonshow.com/
I HAVE A DREAM, @DougAPalooza. A dream of one day having my own talk show. Until that day, I have a blog. Enjoy!
Thx! //RT @romanov_76_110 Why didn't you mention www.TheJillDobsonShow.com earlier? It was lots of fun & was laughing out loud several times
Here's my plan to honor the legacy of @Oprah: http://tinyurl.com/3k6mj2e
These yoga-then-omelette mornings remind me of my spin-then-grits days with @DialKyle. #GuiltFreeGorging #MmmmGrits
I recently sang [read: destroyed] that song at karaoke. Sober. I'm a brave, brave soul. // RT @siksigmabarry I'd love to sing"Baby Got Back"
My last tweet was a reply to this. // RT @romanov_76_110 @JillDobson But the real question is: why aren't you watching #RedEye Ms. Dobson...
Oops - good call!  Turning on @GregGutfeld now!  (I mean that in more ways than one!  No, I don't!  Yes, I do!)
George Clooney Vacations with Jill Dobson—Take that, Elisabetta! // RT @eonline: Leo DiCaprio Vacations With Blake Lively—Take That, Bar!
Wow! Rob Nelson and @PeggyBunker on @ABC World News Now sure are a barrel of laughs for 3:40am. This viewer has never enjoyed insomnia more!
Thanks! // RT @yankee_faithful Jill you really do have the prettiest gums in showbiz. That's the first thing I noticed when you were at FNC.
Most unusual compliment I've received? Jill Scott told me I had a nice smile with "pretty gums." Thanks... I've been flossing!
Sometimes when you interview celebrities, they are kind enough to give you a compliment.
...I ask because when I see Ellen dance, I'm kind of reminded of myself.  And I'm not sure if I should feel good about that... or awesome.
Time to watch ELLEN! Poll: Is her dancing A) good; B) bad or just C) enthusiastic? What do YOU think??
Based on the sounds coming from the front seat, I've deduced that my cabdriver is CLIPPING HIS NAILS!  Uh, safety first, sir...please?!!
Tell her she's GREAT in Bridesmaids! //RT @CooperLawrence: Hey, Kristen Wigg is on the show this morning. What??! 8:50AM on PLJ
@KristoferBuckle Maybe gorgeousness would ensue IF I got to work with the talented Kristofer Buckle for a day!  A girl can dream...
I love school, but sheesh! Franco has studied at 7 universities! // James Franco's Higher Education http://eonli.ne/iVWJlw via @eonline
@KristoferBuckle - You did it! Congrats!
I'm so happy for @AliciaR!  She's at a special @Oprah taping and is live-tweeting the Oprah Spectactular.  Follow her!
So, has Marisa surpassed Anne Hathaway as your ultimate dream girl? // RT @BowmanInc: Today @MarisaMiller... told me I looked "festive."
I like your thinking, Zach! // RT @montyth: @chelseahandler if you need a fill in from time to time, @jilldobson has my vote!
@altgeldshrugged After Twitter-stalking you, I didn't want to scare you more by introducing myself! Thanks for answering my Q from afar! :)
@ChelseaHandler says of her talk show, "I'll maybe have some people fill in for me once in a while." Ooh, ooh, pick ME! Pick MEEEE!
"Armpit" by @BillSchulz! //RT @andilavs Celeb fragrance find: Love to the Fullest by Reese Witherspoon. I also love JLO Glow & SJP NYC. You?
Jen Lancaster just gave a great answer to my question, "Does your husband read your books?" You should attend an @altgeldshrugged reading!
Ooh, a style compliment from @StacyLondonSays! Best. Day. Ever.
I'll watch! Also, I'm in lavender today. Hot or Not? // RT @StacyLondonSays I'm talking color Weds on the 830am half hour of the TODAY Show.
I'm sobbing, actually. // RT @HollywoodLife: Jersey Shore will begin filming this week in Florence, Italy! Rejoice or cry - your call.
Yes. // RT @rbrockington: I feel like my brain is going to explode from massive stimulation. Is this what Charlie Sheen always feels like?
I'm jealous of @aliciar - she gets to interview my "friend in my head," author @altgeldshrugged! Hey, have YOU read "If You Were Here" yet?
Listen up, ladies! Dex's abs are back! // RT @aliciar: A possible sequel to SOMETHING BORROWED: http://bit.ly/ksqsed
Can't wait! I love talk shows! I want to BE one. Not just a host, an actual show! // RT @USATODAYlife: Regis Philbin memoir out this fall.
@HollywoodLife Great scoop on the Today Show this morning, Bonnie Fuller!
Best headline of the day! // RT @TheOnion: Childbirth To Be Area Woman's Least Painful Interaction With Daughter http://onion.com/aMIUpx
Fact: Shopping for purses is the most fun of all. (Right, @BillSchulz?) // RT @BowmanInc Fact: It is more fun to shop for shirts than pants.
Remember when @ehasselbeck & @tthasselbeck switched jobs for a day? Awesome! Other power pairs should do it - Oprah & Stedman; Bill & Andy
@mariekeefe Not a critical fave. No "No Country for Old Men." A fun "who had dibs on the hot guy first" flick! Enjoy! #SomethingBorrowed
At an early screening of "Something Borrowed" I literally laughed til I cried a couple times. My fellow cynical journalists cracked up, too.
Good news, @AliciaR! Your doppelgänger, @WhoopiGoldberg, is now on Twitter!
My #FF suggestion for y'all: The guy who made the best Bin Laden comment of the week...(drumroll please)... @DaveEaston21
Are you watching @ehasselbeck and The View ladies today? I'm so excited to see "Nurse Jackie" herself, Edie Falco. That show is the BEST!
Welcome to my Twitter friend #6343, Air Force wife @rcwaterfield! USAF note: I once flew with the Thunderbirds. (Yes, I puked. Repeatedly!)
Thanks a lot, @BillSchulz, for getting "Baby Got Back" stuck in my head... where it'll likely stay til 2012.
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. -Thomas Edison (via @cal_francis)

I'm totally kidding... I don't even know what reflexology is. Do you?
@dawnyanek Meantime, the woman doing my reflexology keeps saying I'm too obese. Her tip will also be, um, excellent.
Ever unknowingly tweeted something that turned out to be the biggest news in the world? This guy has: http://on.cnn.com/iMaMEv
"Moment of Unity" for America: http://wapo.st/jonmc9
@lindsaylohan - All the latest updates are on www.washingtonpost.com
Dr. Rosen told me I have "a perfect set." Of course, he's my dentist and was referring to my teeth. Why? What were you thinking? Podiatrist?
There is a certain 'pack-a-day' quality to that voice, isn't there? @altgeldshrugged
If I were A-list the 1st thing I'd get: a business manager. Bills go straight to him. Only thing in my mailbox? InStyle, W, Vogue, Bazaar...
I never knew you were such a skilled artist, @ehasselbeck! That's amazing! Did @tthasselbeck return the favor and paint YOU?
Now, that's just mean! // RT @PhitinsPhan: @JillDobson what time is the Rangers game.....?
I'll come, Sherri! #NotAStalkerJustANiceViewViewer // RT @SherriEShepherd: Throwing Jeffrey his birthday party & only 3 people have RSVP'd
My last tweet is only funny if you know the *incredibly* slim odds of my Mom ever joining in such hijinks.
@MomDobson- Wanna crack out our pink bikinis? // RT @WendyWilliams: MOMS/DAUGHTERS If you want to be in our swimsuit fashion show, email us!
...and now I have to leave Twitter & tune in. So much for my plan! // RT @byrnes22: On @MLBNetwork 6pmET breaking down all tonights matchups
Now following @byrnes22, @tthasselbeck & @billybush.  I get all the MLB, NFL & LiLo news I can use, without ever leaving Twitter. #Awesome
I got an early media copy of "If You Were Here" by @altgeldshrugged and LOVED it! Read her fiction, read her memoirs, attend her book tour!
Help! We're becoming a bunch of narcissists! Well, YOU are. Not me. I'm better than that. http://nyti.ms/hD0967
I bet it's a fascinating week of work for @billybush, reporting LIVE from London! I'm enjoying watching LIVE from New York, Billy!
So cute! // RT @ehasselbeck: I told my son there are 100 pennies in a dollar bill. Eyes wide, he holds it out flat: "HOW did they DO that?"
Seriously out of breath after chatting on phone with an old friend. #NeedToDoMoreCardio
US Weekly cover story, here I come! // RT @followfriday_us: @jilldobson was  #832 Most Recommended Celebrity this week http://bit.ly/hAOjFQ
Enjoy them, @StacyLondonSays! I'm also enjoying egg-shaped Reese cups and those pastel-colored Cadbury mini eggs... for breakfast!!!
"@cwhiatt: Come on  #NYRangers get a goal or two and make it interesting here. #nhlplayoffs"
Never! [Insert evil cackle here.] RT // @bubbascrzy: @JillDobson Helllo Jill, do you ever tweet back to an unimportant person like me?
So glad @StacyLondonSays is at this party! I styled myself head-to-toe in Dr. Scholl's, Lee and Pantene, just in case!
Enjoying "The View" this Good Friday. So glad I took Mom to the show - Whoopi, @ehasselbeck, @SherriEShepherd etc are ON! Tune in.
I don't deserve any #FF love this week. All I tweeted about was sports. WHO AM I anymore?!! #IdentityCrisis
I'm so sorry to hear they were killed! I liked them!// RT @anferno: @jessiecantrell @mikeogorman @patdsez killed on the YHTBT Podcast...
Kangaroos! The shoes with pockets for stuff! (Like a penny or a nickel. Not much else would fit.) //RT @ehasselbeck: #favoriteshoe as a kid?
NYC too! // RT @altgeldshrugged Chicagoans take to the streets in panic, confused and terrified by enormous yellow ball of light in the sky.
Ackkk! Me too! // RT @underadar: About to schedule double bypass surgery....CLEAR!  #NYRangers playing with my emotions!
It has never been louder at The Garden! Let's Go #NYRangers!
@hellskitten is a GREAT Twitter name! Way more creative than, uh, @jilldobson! // RT @dawnyanek: Time for beer and cheese with @hellskitten!
I'm so jealous! I love the Wendy Williams show! // RT @dawnyanek: Many thanks to the fabulous @WendyShow for having me on this morning.
You're all over @martharadio lately, @rbrockington! I love it!
That sounded braggy, didn't it? Sorry. I actually meant it in a "Whoa, that screaming line drive almost busted me in the face" kind of way.
#GoYankees You know you're sitting too close when your seat says: http://yfrog.com/hs5afsfj
G'day to my 6200nd Twitter friend, @martineeliserus! In Australia, no less. I wrote a report about your continent/country in 4th grade!
(Note: Scott Hamilton later showed up for the aforementioned interview with the nice reporter and was just lovely. So all was forgiven.)
'Scott Hamilton' (verb) - A form of online revenge that happens when you stand up nice reporters for the Today Show. Invented by @BowmanInc
I suggest you read through my pal @BowmanInc's tweets. World, do not cross this guy. He'll mock you mercilessly and/or 'Scott Hamilton' you.
Do you watch @WendyShow and LOVE it, too?  If so... How you doin'?
...And I was singing it at the top of my lungs. 12 hours straight. My neighbors actually complained to the super.
It's cuz I spent all yesterday singing "The sun will come out...Tomorrow!" You're welcome. /RT @dawnyanek Hooray! Sun and warm weather! #nyc
@BillSchulz, self-proclaimed #1 fan of Jill Dobson, just updated www.jilldobson.com. I should get cracking on my planned "Bill Smells" site.
Visiting NYC? You MUST SEE @MillionDQuartet with James Moye and the gang, or you ain't nothing but a hounddog!
I miss Michigan! But NY's cold winter/spring makes me feel right at home! // RT @CransonB: Hey Jill...  How is my old Branch County friend?
What about Barry Manilow fans? // RT @EW: Nirvana and Metallica fans most likely to go 'all the way' on first date.

SOMEBODY'S been watching "Kourtney & Kim Take NY!"// RT @rdercjr: @JillDobson Can you drink from a keg hose while suspended upside down?
So true! // RT @michaelparks11: @JillDobson Ya but you have the best followers. So really you have more than Kim.
I'd say you're, at most, half right! :) //RT @cdog32: @JillDobson You're hotter and smarter than her. They should be following you.
OMMMGGGGG I hit over 7 million followers! Seriously guys! U mean the world to me!!! / Oh, sorry. I thought I was @KimKardashian for a sec.
@altgeldshrugged Schadenfreude? No, that's not it. What other "Avenue Q" words might work here?

I'm hosting Strategy Room -- tune in now ONLINE at www.foxnews.com/strategyroom and join the conversation about Timberlake, Streisand, P ...

@BillSchulz has gone from gentle weeping to full-blown sobbing.  When @AndyLevy and I team up against him, anything is possible!

Oprah is all a-Twitter now.  Friends, our secret is out.
@BillSchulz, as a recent RedEye guest, I am deeply offended at your recent tweets that @AndyLevy is the only amusing person on the show!
