@coldwired @anitakgran We do.  We also offer same leave for new parents thru adoptions and surrogacies.
.@coldwired @anitakgran And we offer paternity leave and, in 2015, 823 men at Yahoo took a paternity leave.
.@anitakgran # of women who took leave = 469; # of women who took maximum leave = 349; # of women who took less than one month leave = 1(me)
.@anitakgran Thanks for asking me to explain/comment and HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY to all!
.@anitakgran I understand there is a worry about setting the tone, but the data suggests it isn't an issue at Yahoo.
.@anitakgran I understand I'm the exception, and need to be, for all the reasons cited. I find other ways/times to bond with my kids.
@anitakgran # of women who took leave = 469; # of women who took maximum leave = 349; # of women who took less than one month leave = 1 (me)
.@anitakgran At Yahoo in 2015, every new mom took at least 1 month of maternity leave and nearly 75% took full amount allowed (14 weeks).

@karon @johndphoto I worded my answer terribly. I really apologize for what it sounded like outside of the context and notion of Flickr Pro.
@karon @johndphoto Yes, was regarding Flickr Pro, which we are deprecating, there are no "Pros" on Flickr - all users have the terabyte.
@stephenherron Yes, apologies.
@pcwilliams Sorry about that! Was about terabyte on @Flickr, how many photos everyone takes, and that storage needs aren't that different.
@savoryexposure It was a misstatement on my part and out of context.  Was about the terabyte on @Flickr &amp; how many photos everyone takes.
@GiveBackBroker thanks!
@LaurenUntangled Apologies!

@minarad That is very weird... :/
@efors If your laptop doesn't have an accelerometer (not all do) then we just default to the spinning (no way to sense the tilt)
@minarad Really?  That's what I'm using.  Try clicking on the mobile and drag it.
Two notes on Calder: click and drag to put the mobile in motion, rock your laptop side to side and it behaves gravitationally correctly.
Yes, that is the coolest part!  RT @amycao: Don't mind me. Just shaking my laptop to make the mobile move.
@velorg The shadow is under the search box and buttons.
