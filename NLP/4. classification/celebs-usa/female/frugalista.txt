@aisha1908 We don‚Äôt have slavery money, and we pay more to issue bonds. IMO, funding doesn‚Äôt matter as much if no one is investing in you. I say get in where it feels right.
@aisha1908 Morgan is thriving now. It‚Äôs been setting up good partnerships. No?
@aisha1908 @MoreAndAgain I‚Äôm really not trying to be a contrarian, but I don‚Äôt want someone to read this thread and be discouraged from pursuing an arts major at an HBCU.
@aisha1908 @MoreAndAgain I don‚Äôt agree that entering the creative workforce is harder coming from HBCUs. Contacts and people promoting you are necessary. We have formal and informal networks to help. Chad Boseman and Susan K. Watson got help from Denzel Washington and Phylicia Rashad to study in London.
@aisha1908 @MoreAndAgain You forgot Brian Tyree Henry, John David Washington, Bradford Young and Susan Kelechi Watson. HBCU creatives are booked and busy.

@MrChuckD I have managed expectations when it comes to the Grammys, but I want the next generation to have what I had growing up. The Motown 25 special had MJ doing the Moonwalk. I‚Äôm always going to fight for the creators of the culture to be able to showcase their talent EVERYWHERE.
@MrChuckD If it were Marc Anthony, I could see it. I‚Äôd be excited. However, that‚Äôs not who is being billed and promoted. Furthermore, I‚Äôd like to see Normani, HER and Jazmine Sullivan take the stage and do Motown. I hope they get the chance.
@MrChuckD Nope. Not doing this with you. Some Puerto Ricans claim their black heritage. Others don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt understand. There have been tons of studies on this.

Some info on Ruth Simmons, the first black woman to be a president at an Ivy League college. Simmons served as president of Brown University (Rainbow‚Äôs alma mater). Simmons graduated from Dillard, an #hbcu in New Orleans. #blackish https://t.co/RScNGQEmBM
I woke up pissed. I pray my Twitter followers forgive me.  I regret watching it, but an HBCU blog alerted me to watch. Jokes on me. üëø https://t.co/n1dEN6SzLx
Anyway, here‚Äôs some info on the Brown University-Tougaloo College relationship. Don‚Äôt let anti-black propaganda, disguised as a ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù argument stop you from learning the truth about black culture. https://t.co/fHnTGaX5DE #hbcu #blackish
I really hope black colleges do a better job about restricting access to certain entities that only seek to profit while undermining the validity of black colleges. The days of ‚ÄòA Different World‚Äô-type programming are long gone.  #blackish
It‚Äôs very dangerous how ‚Äúblack‚Äù programs are being used to discredit and undermine black spaces. The show showed way more care when debating using the N-word than it did discussing a college decision. #blackish
Woke up still disappointed in #blackish and its portrayal of #HBCUs.  Rainbow is a Brown graduate. She‚Äôd know that the school had a black female HBCU graduate (Ruth Simmons) as its president for 11 years. Brown also has a feeder program with Tougaloo College, an #hbcu in Miss.
@TeritaTweets I haven‚Äôt been in so long. I‚Äôm good. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@TeritaTweets Yo! Cats will tell me the dates!
The messaging on  #blackish and the #hbcu experience was dangerous. Let‚Äôs stop hoping that Junior gets a spin off show. All they‚Äôd do is trash #HBCUs. Let‚Äôs pray that the rest of the kids go to Liberty U. or that school where the girl got poisoned by her roommate. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
In addition, Howard University and other #HBCUs  have relationships with tons of corporations. Google, NASA and Intel, for instance. Why wasn‚Äôt this discussed? The fact that the Dad on #blackish has a career should be proof that they work.
Furthermore, the #Blackish parents never wanted to take their kids to homecoming at Howard? Or any #hbcu? I have a ton of black friends who have been to more Howard homecomings than I‚Äôve ever attended!
Rewatching this #blackish episode. The mother is a doctor. The majority of black physicians attended an #hbcu. And no mention about the trials and tribulations of black kids on white campuses? Why?
Black Generation Z kids will never know television programming where the validity of their culture and its ability to provide for them was not a public debate. In the ‚Äò90s, it was understood, promoted and cherished. Why are we hustling in reverse? #hbcu https://t.co/3ZDMbCaE8U
I miss #hbcu grads like Debbie Allen and Phylicia Rashad. They‚Äôd never use their platforms to question the validity of HBCUs. Our culture isn‚Äôt up for debate with the masses. #blackish
Nope. I interned every summer in ‚Äúwhite society‚Äù and had a job waiting on me in ‚Äúwhite society‚Äù after graduation. Got my book deal from a ‚Äúwhite society‚Äù publisher and EVERYONE regardless of race was on board. #blackish https://t.co/wtgRfK1bpR

@DavidHarewood Thank you! Have a good one!
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood That's cool.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Boo. A star with no stars in his eyes? Tsk.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I think you are. I feel great after a good movie. Finding light in a sad situation as an actor has to feel great.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Maybe therapeutic.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I know he upset a lot of people, but America already knows him. We don't know the B-Bs as well.SLJ is going nowhere.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 SLJ even held Martin Luther King's dad hostage at Morehouse as a student protester!
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Hopefully, you get a chance to sit down with SLJ. He was an usher at Martin Luther King's funeral. So much history.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 So, I'll be sure to tell people about our tweets and leave them up.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I don't think that essay really represented your abilities as a human being.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I think you have karma points. I'm glad that I tweeted you. I hope others get to see this side of you.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Baggage is a loaded word. Racial perspective sounds better. Baggage sounds like a problem. Lol
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 And you can get one with a black director, too. The right black independent director takes a film places.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I'm really happy with the crop of black directors. It's exciting and you can tell a difference in the work.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood Race baggage is the reasoning people argued that it's better to have white directors on black films. No bueno.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood The "race baggage" wording makes me uncomfortable and I've heard several people use it. (1)
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 &amp; you believe your perspective as a B-B makes you uniquely qualified for roles. SLJ believes the same for A-As.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I'm going to send SLJ's link so I can listen again. I really think he argued perspective, too.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Sam Jackson said that an African American actor may have had a different idea about the character, no?
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Who are the South African actors?
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 SLJ made a brief statement about perspective and everyone brought out pitchforks.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Also, if you are arguing for perspective, why did the Black Brits revolt so harshly against SLJ? It was visceral.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 It doesn't sound that way to A-A ears.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood Sometimes being protective is good. Sometimes it's stifling.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood When you say that being an ethnic outsider is an advantage, that's what makes me feel, I guess, protective.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 It's one thing to say that you are talented, work hard, serious, so you bring your skills to a role.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood I feel alienated.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 When I read quotes, essays from actors+directors that say British are better at playing AA historical figures...
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood America has had first-generation blacks and immigrant blacks as actors. Nia Long is of Trini descent.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 We may not ever view the essay the same, but it's good that we attempted to understand.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I appreciate that you are taking the time.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 I appreciate it. I don't want to harangue you for your views.

@DavidHarewood @rebel19 Your last paragraph reads like you think A-A actors aren't able to portray historical figures in their culture.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood I would never say that Black Brits don't deserve opportunities here. Please be mindful, though.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood These characters are our culture.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood Again, I'm hoping that you and others take a step back and really think about how you are navigating.
@rebel19 @DavidHarewood It's dangerous to say you can portray another culture better than members of that culture because of your ethnicity.
@DavidHarewood @rebel19 The last paragraph in the essay was problematic.  I hope you're able to see that in time.

@kbmiami So true!
@kbmiami I can't put it all on immigrants. It's everywhere you find people of color who have been disrupted.
@kbmiami It's very hard to not subscribe to colonization. Most messages we receive promotes whiteness as the supreme.
@kbmiami Ah. Well many people don't have intellectual curiosity. Many countries of color have been colonized, so that mindset is standard.
@kbmiami What is the project's goal?
@kbmiami Indeed.
@kbmiami Indeed. The school systems don't teach it. Sometimes American parents don't pass it on. They want kids to be like everyone else.

@OMGitsDaGenius @Phil_Lewis_ We don't view the article the same. Nor do we have to. Be well.
@OMGitsDaGenius @Phil_Lewis_ In vernacular "black college" means HBCU. We all know this.
@OMGitsDaGenius @Phil_Lewis_ The entire premise of her article was saying that she had a black college experience. Not a reach.
@OMGitsDaGenius @Phil_Lewis_  HBCUs are more than spaces where black people congregate.
@OMGitsDaGenius @Phil_Lewis_ The essay was written to discredit the uniqueness of the HBCU experience.
@OMGitsDaGenius @Phil_Lewis_ It was implied. She compared the numbers at Spelman and other black colleges to the numbers at her college.

You can't say you support the middle class and do hatchet work on college budgets. Never going to buy it.
College is one of the best ways to increase American earning potential. Why are they on the chopping block?
Politicians campaign saying they will help the middle class and then cut college funding. Middle-class jobs are lost by the cuts.
I hope #hbcus ask the right questions when candidates visit this election cycle. Don't allow your campus to be used for platform and press.
Black colleges produce wonderful people like Toni Morrison. I question why any elected official wouldn't cherish them.
I need to celebrate awesome people more and ignore the terrible ones.
I shouldn't be this excited about Toni Morrison's birthday. She's such an important person. Sula is my favorite novel by her.

If you're fortunate to move along in life, you aren't the needy. You are the needed.
I wish Kanye would use his power to advocate for more funding for small + mid-range creators who need help.He could be an angel investor.
It seems like whenever Kanye goes on a tirade something happens. I am not a Kanye fan. He's mean and abusive. But, he moves the needle.
Kanye has the connections, but I don't think he has the approved introductions. His Twitter campaign will elevate him or demolish him.
Getting venture capital is an insider's pursuit-either you have the connections that come with an approved introduction or you don't.
I'm trying to decide if Kanye's antics/Twitter fundraising campaign can only happen to Kanye or if there is something else there.
Read Kanye's timeline. He may end up getting funded. Unwittingly, he launched a 1 percenter gofundme start up on his Twitter timeline.

Crazy what will go viral. Given @MsPattiPatti 's appeal in certain communities, I could see pie-eating events at nightclubs/drag shows. #sm
@BeezHunny @MsPattiPatti Yes. And buying in bulk. Lordt.
#strandedinus is beautiful and right.
@Crusky I can tell that you have a good heart. You care about the little person. I just think Howard cares, too. That's all.
@Crusky The student is a lacrosse player.
@Crusky OK.
@Crusky Plenty of students get housing on campus and keep it. The University is not creating a tent city of homeless students.
@Crusky "Parents take note" Really? No one has his file and only the University and the student know what happened.

@Midwestcap @White_House_PR I don't have specifics on your school. I spoke generally. https://t.co/ztRLahcBJR
@Midwestcap @White_House_PR Good stuff. I haven't studied closely.I know there have been studies about black college athletes and education.
@White_House_PR That's true. Nothing to do with the protests. Tough living if you don't make it pro and have no degree.
@White_House_PR Then they'll start their own businesses.
@White_House_PR If they make an NFL team owner rich with their talent, they'll be fine. Money talks.
The winner in all this #mizzou mess is the football team. Talk is cheap. No one cares. Show them the money (out the door.)
Money talks here in America. Always has. Always will. Where you spend your money shows what you value most. Don't value disrespect.
Don't finance your own abuse. That's my #frugalista tip. People may not respect you, but they will respect your money leaving them.
America has so many choices for college.We have schools based on gender, race, religion and more. Find the best school for YOU!
College is one of the biggest investments that you will make. Pick a school that will encourage you. Anything less is unacceptable.
And with everything I do, I try to share a little cheer or optimism mixed in with a solution. @howardu taught me that.
I'm going to keep peeking in on all these trends related to race and education. I just had to let Twitter know that there are options.
Being #blackoncampus can have many different meanings. All #hbcu grads should take one kid under age 15 to a Classic game or homecoming.
My parents met at an #hbcu, my brother and I attended one. All of my cousins graduated from #hbcus .We have to raise people in the culture.
I had a mentee who had a hard time at her #pwi . I suggested Howard to her and she recoiled. You have to groom people young. #hbcu
#hbcu (s) need to hit people up in junior high or earlier. I think there is a real opportunity there.
Not enough to ask  #blackoncampus people to transfer. My experience is that many #pwi students would enroll again, despite the experience.
Reading  #blackoncampus tweets. #hbcu (s) need a specific plan to reach potential students earlier.  The experiences are so different.
@ItsEstaFiesta It's about to be the next race war. Twitter is a mess!
Attend your #hbcu alumni meetings and participate in recruiting events. The #mizzou and #yale students have made their choice. Think ahead.
Students who attend #pwi do so because they want to. Focus on getting the next generation of #hbcu students enrolled.
This #PWI vs. #hbcu debate is sad. I want #hbcu grads/students to focus on recruiting early in high schools.  No more Twitter fingers.

@Nettaaaaaaaa Good stuff. I just got worried that you hated the school or didn't see any value in the college.  I appreciate the time.
@Nettaaaaaaaa I agree. No one should turn a blind eye to injustice. I wonder if there is a way to segment.
@Nettaaaaaaaa And I know lots of Howard students and graduates embrace your work.
@Nettaaaaaaaa And I'm not used to you having a dismissive attitude. My take away from your work is to be inclusive.
@Nettaaaaaaaa I'm not saying that you can't have a point of view. It just seemed dismissive and I'm not sure the school deserves that.
@Nettaaaaaaaa Thank you for responding. There's admin and then there is the rest. Nothing is perfect.
@Nettaaaaaaaa I was proud of how your work had all genders, sexual orientation and classes. Why did you need to be anti-Howard?

Don't be so quick to have an agenda or a platform in college.Focus on your studies, correct your mistakes and become a capable person.

We all make mistakes. College is the perfect time to make them quietly, learn and come out smarter for the experience.

@TeritaTweets Right.
@ChloeeJP I hope things get better. The short-term goal would be for your friend to find housing independent of the school.
@ChloeeJP I read about the Takeover problems. I care, but I also have been around enough to know it will pass.
Y'all may make me find my old college clips and tweet out my coverage of the annual Howard student revolt. Heheh.
So cute when current Howard kids tweet me about their online activism against the administration. In my day, we took over buildings. ‚úä üëä
@ChloeeJP The students will survive it all and go on to do wonderful things. It's just the course of life there.
@ChloeeJP Howard has students getting Rhodes scholars and creating inventions during NASA internships. I don't feel bad for the students.
@ChloeeJP When I was at Howard we took over the A building, like generations before had taken it over. It's how we do at Howard. All good.
@ChloeeJP He needs to get a loan, find a place on Craigslist, and keep it moving.   It's a setback and not abuse.
@ChloeeJP help for what?
@onli4Songz We don't have all the details. They could have given him more time, but they felt his infraction was too deep.Time will tell.
I write this as a proud Howard grad. We all had our hiccups on campus. We took the hits and moved on. #focus #HomelessatHoward

A full scholarship at a private college is an honor. Protect your privilege by doing the right thing. #HomelessatHoward
No one is asking why the "friends" he sneaked into the dorm aren't housing him. There is a lesson here, if he's open. #HomelessatHoward
@onli4Songz right
Most of the social justice activists hyping him up did not attend an #hbcu and have no concept of how the schools work. #HomelessatHoward
I hate to see young people go down the social media rabbit hole and burn bridges with people in real life over it.  #HomelessatHoward
He should repair his relationship w/ the school. The people hyping him up have not invested in him like Howard has. #HomelessatHoward
He's proven to be excellent at marketing. He's gone viral by influencing the influencers on social media. &gt;&gt;#homelessathoward
If #HomelessatHoward kid were smart, he'd take this loss, find a place to stay and move into the dorms next year.

#fireraven @theview
If @theview doesn't condemn Raven's remarks, I will believe that it dislikes black women. Raven's Michelle Obama remarks were awful, too.
@DJNYC1 http://t.co/v0ctFS7gWV
@AGirlAboutStyle She said she's not African American.
I wouldn't accept Raven's comments from anyone, regardless of race. The View advertisers need to let us know if they agree with Raven.
I won't let Raven's comments slide. This is beyond witty memes and threats of racial drafts. The View MUST answer for her comments.
Black women suffer heavily from unemployment. For Raven to advocate name-based employment discrimination is unconscionable.
Raven has benefitted financially from black creative genius, but makes it her agenda to alienate and marginalize black people.
Maybe Raven's letting everyone in on how people truly feel about black people in the industry. We can assume, but maybe she's verifying.
I'm past being upset at Raven's antics. I'm looking at the people who associate with her and keep her career going. Do they agree?
