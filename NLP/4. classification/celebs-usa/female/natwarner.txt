@BKlYnCeNaTiON hiiii! It isn't up for free download & prob wont be soon as it's been rerecorded for the album! It IS on iTunes though :0)
Just sneezed so hard that my phone flew out of my hand!
Had some fun adventures today. By fun I mean lame! But good stories! Can't wait to be in CA Saturday!
The end!
... b/c YOUR trailer actually had car tires on it, & no wonder they exploded--in a thunderstorm!!!!
...and then being stranded at a tire store for 3.5 hours waiting for the right kind of trailer tires to come in...
Know what's so cool? Blowing a tire on your trailer & being stranded on the side of the road for 1.5 hours...
NOT the best thing that's ever happened to me! ...at least @t_rav_bing figured out the problem! http://yfrog.com/bcbetyj
@josephsaid whoaaa! But it wouldn't be the same without Sydney and Vaughn! And Jack!! Haha
@kristyduh 3 weeks just 3 weeks!!!
@T_Rav_bing "our" as in mine and @scottmckay haha
@T_Rav_bing duhhh that is our child, La Kraveddiephen Keng. ;-) thank you for your help! We are gone!!! :0( / :0)

HAPPY BIRTHDAY @SCOTTMCKAY !!!
I really want some corn on the cob
@memphised haha it takes a while to process it i think
OMG LOST!!!! jk i haven't seen it yet. too many commercials so i'm gonna start it in like ehhh 15-20.
@laurenbing or do you mean like you've only seen 5? never mind i know what you mean BUT WHAT I SAID STILL IS VALID haha i dont knowww
@laurenbing only if you think you'll make it to the last one without finding out how it ends beforehand haha
@Steelaw no. Your mom isn't either.
@memphised o ya kno
I have to actively stop myself from tweeting about food sometimes.
@skilletfan92 Haha
@crestsofwaves I don't know, aren't they all the same? Hahahaha ahhhh. Rock with me? Rock with you? Rock your body? I dont know the title ha
All my single ladies need to tweet @memphised
I seriously lost 3 followers for daring to say that LOST might be disappointing?! hahahaha oh you guys. I'll be watching it either way
@dannynicoletto psh every time is coffee time. every day is coffee day.
Haha at everyone taking today off for LOST. No way will it be as satisfying as we've hyped it up to be haha

Last minute rerecording of vocals? So sucky. Doing them at midnight coz you can't any other time? Even worse
haha oh i love that you just did that @theotherdevo
I love the new black eyed peas single. There I said it. Shoot me.
Do NOT ever go to The Spa of Cool Springs. They overcharged me $21 and refused to refund it! Massage ruled, but the front desk people SUCK

@TheEllenShow Why don't you add this little number to the caption for that video: Text REDCROSS to 90999 to donate $10 to help those in TN
Really can't believe that people are still asking "what happened in TN?"
@TheEllenShow "some storms" ?? How about "THE storm that drowned Tennessee" ??? Are you even aware of what's happening down here?
@slowhandsmusic does your fam need anything???
You know it's bad when your city is flooded and no celebrities are issuing statements of faux sadness and "thoughts and prayers" ....haha
@zacfarro spoke to your mom-you got so many people looking out for you friend! gonna help clean up tomorrow! we'll make it shiny..ish!
If you need a place to stay in TN, come hit me, @laurenbing or @kristyduh up because we will for sure bake you treats and help you eat them
Things are back up and running over here. Thankfully!! Back to work, but if anyone of my TN friends needs anything--let me know!!
BUNNIES AND RAINBOWS!
@BarackObama I sure hope you're paying more attention to what's happening in TN than the national news is! Send relief!
@CNN it's a big deal that someone attempted to bomb TS..but people are DYING & HOMELESS here & you're barely covering it so no one knows!
@CNN why do you not care about the fact that half of Tennessee is underwater? How is this not a big enough news story to you?
I'm sorry but why does the national news not seem to care that landlocked Tennessee just became several small islands??
if any of my friends need help tomorrow...in any way...let me know yo!!
@laurenbing it's like Christmas!
You know what is nice about not being able to work or leave the house?? The opportunity to catch up on 24!!!
