Loved the #AcademyAwards show last night! The no host clearly worked. It started making me think about other ‘no’s’ we don’t need.  What's something else we don’t need that we don't think about? #Oscars2019
I'm sitting down with two of my favorite people on this week's episode of my #MeaningfulConversations podcast: Dorothea and @jonbonjovi to talk about the work they are doing with @JBJSoulFound to bring dignity to the issue of homelessness and hunger. https://t.co/uE3gI3yrmh https://t.co/5D9V1m2ZnY
Prescription: Watch this over and over.  You’ll have a great week, trust me. Happy Monday :) https://t.co/nmVUcBZtBb
As the world rages on and as others try to pull us into the noise, it’s important that we have tools and practices to help resist this pull. So this week, think about what you value. Think about your priorities.  Think about how you can seek the light. https://t.co/wBGJIwcOze
One of my core beliefs is in staying the course. Being persistent. This is such a great example of that @kenradio! https://t.co/zzxdMpjK6P
Stepping back, pausing and reflecting. Bravo, wish more people would do this - good for you @KirstenPowers. https://t.co/uurvoV18EW

Thank you @GavinNewsom for appointing me to lead the new Task Force on Alzheimer’s Prevention &amp; Preparedness. CA has to research ways to prevent #Alzheimers. We have to better prepare families for the physical, financial &amp; spiritual realities of this disease. We can do this.

This week, I want to challenge myself to find love within. I want to challenge myself to have conversations that are hard to have. I want to challenge myself to take the time to listen. After all, love isn’t as easy as “roses are red and violets are blue.” https://t.co/1AWwZImKCi
This is clear, smart and true. I’d also venture to say that she's saying this with such passion because she loves her country. https://t.co/twUvzPmqTT

I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to address world leaders at the World Dementia Summit in London yesterday and discuss why #Alzheimers is a women’s issue.
This speech moved me. I don’t know a parent alive who wouldn’t want their child to say this. President H.W. Bush was a gentleman, great family man. I always loved that about him &amp;there he was surrounded by his family—his pride &amp; joy &amp;his strength. Great reminder to us all. https://t.co/fmyXH0BgWo
What's your favorite quote? I share mine with my friend @hodakotb in her new series "Quoted By... with Hoda." These words help me stay strong no matter what I go through. Find out what I share with Hoda in our conversation: https://t.co/1SaKBh29zM
Excited to join the World Dementia Council Summit in London today with @womensalz! #DefeatingDementia https://t.co/OYmDSKdYHA

Fascinating new report via @CivicEnterprise @HartSurveys @caselorg &amp; @Allstate tells us what kids need &amp;what we need to know. A must-read for every parent, educator &amp; policy maker. Kids want to be seen, heard &amp; respected. They want to feel safe https://t.co/nGDDlePTNp
There’s always a chance for something new.  #MondayMeditation #prayer #IveBeenThinking https://t.co/xDeNsbYbE5
I love the notion that we triumph, not in spite of our wounds and our suffering, but because of them. Wounds hurt us, but they can also make us more human. They make us more vulnerable, more open and more connected.  Read more of what #IveBeenThinking: https://t.co/F3Y2uw8UCM
So proud of the work of my brother @bobbyshriver and Bono and Red are saving lives, getting medication to those who need it. https://t.co/45eTGKN2yb

My friend and @womensalz supporter Sue Gragg shared this with me. Exciting. https://t.co/dHTOLtRU7b
In this 1-minute clip from my #ArchitectsOfChange conversation with @DeanOrnishMD, we discuss what you can actually do when you feel stressed out, sad or depressed. We all experience suffering, but it’s what we choose to do with it, he says.  https://t.co/6E3B9fGlel https://t.co/Aq2XPPspTt

This holiday season, I’m taking on the #30DaysOfKindness challenge. I want to bring joy to people around me by making someone else’s day. I’m using small gestures, finding small acts of kindness and reaching out. https://t.co/HuIYK6T1dP
For me, the holiday season is about joy. It’s about my faith. It’s about generosity of spirit (not generosity of my wallet).  https://t.co/FxIBPE7cxG
The @SpecialOlympics makes a powerful difference in the lives of others every day. Thank you to @BankofAmerica and @AnneFinucane for partnering with them and for recognizing the incredible work of so many changemakers in this new campaign. https://t.co/lk7JJXrCgq

This week and this Thanksgiving, I hope you’ll make an effort to connect to those sitting at your table. Listen to what they have to say. Ask them how they are doing (as in, “how are you really doing?”).  https://t.co/oQQHKwWPtc
Good for @CNN for pursuing this in court. Good that other news organizations came together to support and good for the country that they won. Onward. https://t.co/ZlYMPZNNvf
Hang in there @amyschumer! I had this, too. It sucks but there is light at the end of the tunnel! https://t.co/EaKOAFBGyz
Instead, I hope @realDonaldTrump shows gratitude to our firefighters, first responders and all those stepping up to help their fellow Californians. Tell us the money we need to rebuild is on the way. If not, don’t come. (2/2) https://t.co/aZzxQmhKKA
I hope when @realDonaldTrump comes to CA he doesn’t try to lecture or shame us. (1/2)
Good sign of press outlets coming together. The freedom of the press is at stake. https://t.co/yc0e91Ygxe

So many have lost everything &amp;need our support. This is a @gofundme for our dear family friend Will Thach @MollyChristmas. He lost everything but his beloved dog. He’s the best man, loving, smart, kind &amp; caring. If you can pls help us help Will. Thank you. https://t.co/kuNIE6TEe9

Amen to that. You are the heroes among us. Thank you. https://t.co/0TpvbC3Gcg
We just never know what will happen one day to the next. That’s why we must each decide whether we will live each day to its greatest potential, or whether we will succumb to the fear and belief that nowhere is safe. Find out more of what #IveBeenThinking https://t.co/NP5C3MTOCm
I challenged mayors and city leaders @leagueofcities to return home and make their communities #Alzheimers prepared. Many agreed. How exciting. (2/2)
I loved speaking to our nation’s mayors and municipal leaders today at the @leagueofcities City Summit. I especially love that incoming president Mayor Karen Freeman Wilson of Gary, IN, (@karenaboutgary) wants to lead this group next year with a theme of “love your city.” (1/2) https://t.co/kdgTsvGNh7
Ann is super smart, a dedicated public servant, and a mom. We’ve worked together for years. She’ll be a great right-hand. Her works starts now on these fires. Ann, you have our support. https://t.co/yKjXFx7AE2
That’s for damn sure. You guys keep doing your best. Pay him no attention. He doesn’t have a clue. https://t.co/GjK2gfLuLd
We must break the stigma of Alzheimer’s and dementia by speaking openly and honestly about this issue. Millions of American families are dealing with this mind-blowing reality each and every day and they should know they are not alone. https://t.co/zi6Wjhkzkg
As fires burn, as families and lives are upended, the last thing we need is the president criticizing our state. Just get us the help we need. Do it now.
Our neighbors need our help. Please join me in supporting an organization that is on the ground. https://t.co/K1Lkt0N6G7
California firefighters are the best there is, but what they are facing is daunting and life threatening. Please hold them in your prayers.
This is an amazing legacy and a welcome idea in the pursuit of trying to understand brain diseases. Bravo to the Rainwaters for stepping up and innovating. https://t.co/X37OytZ7AS
Yesterday was tragic for so many families, and now this. Thinking of all my fellow Californians this morning who are being forced to evacuate their homes due to fires. Thinking about what we can all do to be of service to our brothers and sisters in pain. https://t.co/5tJoTAjnHZ
The tragedy in Thousand Oaks underscores how much we need women like this in Washington D.C. who will make this their issue. It's got to be everyone's issue. https://t.co/NnSrofzLLM
Agreed, @bobbyshriver. This man died a hero trying to save people during a mass shooting. He ran into danger—he didn’t walk. Thinking of his bravery right now, the lives lost to senseless violence last night and all the family and community rocked by this senseless violence. https://t.co/UTJaMusCjH
This is mind-blowing. https://t.co/Kcz45QBIv4

Oh that’s a good question @JoeBiden. To ask to every person in this country:  Who are you? How they answer will tell us who WE are. https://t.co/YtXJteTCxO
Smart read for any voter in California. In my humble opinion, independents will vote for individuals they see as competent and above the party fray. @StevePoizner was smart to decline to state "no party preference." That’s a path forward for all.  https://t.co/gAI7ZaTYrE

I just heard the news that Father Thomas Keating just passed away. He was such a life force, a living saint, a contemplative man who believed in love, God and silence. I was honored to spend time with him and think of him as a friend. A holy man indeed.

We cannot simply call for civility.  We must practice it.  Respectful tone.  Listen.  No name-calling  Otherwise you’re on a time out.  #ThursdayThoughts #IveBeenThinking
Suspicious packages. Heated rhetoric. Angry outbursts.  We are better than this. But this is result of fanning flames, provoking fear and gaslighting people. All of us have responsibility to turn it down. From the top to the bottom. Demand it. #WednesdayWisdom
We continue to fight this disease that steals the minds as brilliant as Justice O'Connor. I’m more committed than ever. Please join us. #Alzheimers
Today I’m thinking of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. I’ve been honored to work alongside her these past years as we have fought to find a cure for #Alzheimers, the disease that stole her husband's mind and life. She announces that she, too is combatting dementia.

What a kind, insightful tweet @dylanmarron. As our nation moves forward, this is inspiring. Use your pain to fuel your purpose. Good job, @MonicaLewinsky. https://t.co/MVxtLnF4Zl
Votes to confirm. No surprise after listening to this speech. But I must say, I was taken aback by @SenatorCollins speech. The fight may not continue here but it will continue in the streets. If you're looking for inspiration today, go look at the Nobel Peace Prize winners.
“I don’t believe these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving.” -@SenatorCollins   There you have it.
Wow. Surprising to me how @SenatorCollins is throwing cold water on Dr. Ford’s entire testimony.
"I found her testimony to be  sincere, painful and compelling… " -@SenatorCollins, in talking about Dr. Ford.  *But there’s a big BUT.
.@SenatorCollins going all-in on presumption of innocence and fairness.
I’m really surprised by this speech from @SenatorCollins. As I sit here watching this speech, I must say that I'm surprised.
Love this @amyklobuchar. Stand up for something "larger than yourself." Amen. https://t.co/2WDihDZchn

I heard Dr. Mukwege speak several years ago and he blew me away. His work, his dedication of this award to women just made me weep, and Ms. Murad's bravery does as well. This happening today is such perfect timing. I’m so inspired and so hopeful. https://t.co/afYgCEun58
Great, inspiring news today. https://t.co/EOTSHTbwJz

There's an incredible group of seniors in Chicago deemed “super agers”- they’ve avoided many common diseases of old age. On @TODAYshow, I spoke to amazing individuals who have donated their brains to help researchers better understand mysteries of aging. https://t.co/vpA95Y7tC1 https://t.co/LXrbyIT4JZ
Smart point @matthewjdowd. I would also add, since I was watching the news last night with my son who said, 'I don't get what’s happening here, I thought the media was supposed to just give us straight facts, not pontificate.' I said that’s the way it used to be. https://t.co/pwslgxz7Gk
You inspire me @RichardEngel @MaryKForrest. All of you. There are so many inspiring people in our world. Let’s focus on them, shine light on them and lift them up. In doing so, we will lift our spirits, too. https://t.co/itOlHqQ2fL

My heart goes out to Ted. As I’ve said so many times before, this disease affects so many millions of people. Help us get to the bottom of it. https://t.co/TYrKeE9KxP
Was just about to say same. Coons and Flake came together and asked for a pause. This is a glimpse at how our politics could work. https://t.co/K13QgMdw5i
Great comments from Sen. Flake just now. Pause. Try to bring the country together. Have an investigation so we can move forward without people saying we didn’t do one. https://t.co/WmD06MvXsR
Ocean of pain. That is so true. How can we work on this? https://t.co/TWQmQN0zuj
What’s the rush? Can’t we pause and do this right? It’s important not just for Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. It’s important for all of us. Pause. https://t.co/Hn3vgGQ4ml
Listen. Was so impressed with her yesterday as well. https://t.co/Mblp5hP1y1
That’s a wow. I was educated by the Jesuits and the nuns. My dad was in the American Bar Association. Both organizations are saying the same thing. That’s highly unusual and worth noting. https://t.co/11WpJ9LeMh

I am, too. We must all work to build a better nation. A conscious and more compassionate nation. https://t.co/zzGNa5L2j1
Truth. https://t.co/EIjTSSvZkj
Thought-provoking. https://t.co/HdNhIyMsY8
This is so true. Very true also in regards to fiery opening statement @JWGOP. https://t.co/MlfuPjqgH5
It’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to go into public life after what we have witnessed today.
Oh my god. This is every woman’s nightmare. This is a terrifying image. https://t.co/mIgEN2ALhj
Agree @katieleslienews. We need compassion in every area, especially here - I agree. https://t.co/luM7VZnFZQ
That was very clear from watching his testimony @craigmelvin. https://t.co/pkCuzO0AoM
Brett Kavanaugh gives a very powerful, tough and what felt like a rebuttal to Dr. Ford. So clear the toll this process has taken on him and his family.
We have given Dr. Ford our attention and our open minds. She has moved us deeply and I believed everything she said. I intend to give Mr. Kavanaugh my full attention as well.
As Dr. Ford wraps up her historic testimony I’ll remember this day forever. And to all women and men who have experienced sexual assault my heart goes out to you. #IBelieveHer
Sen. @KamalaHarris to Dr. Ford “You have nothing to gain. You are a profile in courage.”
I gotta say, and it might be the altitude, which I doubt, but I’m not following Rachel Mitchell line of questioning. At all.
Next to me. https://t.co/CrMYAkPF87
From one of my brothers: Perhaps this will shock the culture to a new place.
And @LindseyGrahamSC's responses are beyond tone deaf.
Orin Hatch's language is ridiculous.
I’m flying. Everyone on the plane is watching these hearings. I'm getting messages from so many men and women moved to tears, moved to reach out to one another. So many people in pain.
Anxiety and PTSD are always the result of sexual assault and trauma. It’s just the half of it.
So many have experienced sexual assault or rape and never felt entitled to call themselves victims of sexual assault. They too, are victims and survivors. Trauma always impacts memory.
.@SenBlumenthal 'You have been honest about what you can’t remember.' Very important point.
I think Professor Ford's voice shows us that you can be terrified and strong at the same time, which is way more common than people realize.
Thank you for saying this @laurenrankin. So true. https://t.co/o5Y32iS5hD
Agreed. Wondering the same thing @yashar. https://t.co/Ofor5iFpSw
As a mother of boys myself—one turning 21 today, I’m thinking of Professor Ford's sons watching their mom with their dad. This is a moment for boys and men as well.
And since we are on a break, I found sen Grassley opening comments offensive. Just saying.
Me too, me too @neeratanden. https://t.co/JmUWtCsTRA
It’s also super important for everyone to understand that sexual assault comes in so many forms. The trauma lasts a lifetime.
This is an incredibly emotional day for millions of people who have experienced sexual assault, both women and men. Be gentle today to people. You have no clue.
Agreed @JamesFallows. https://t.co/BkRTXe8x6v
It’s impossible for me to believe that Brett Kavanaugh can be confirmed, can be promoted to the Supreme Court.
Listening to Dr. Ford. I could feel my eyes well with tears. So many women understand what she is talking about.
Well said and so true @matthewjdowd. https://t.co/e6KO5zvEED
Sexual assaults are life-shattering. Allow people the time and space they need to come forward. If they don’t want to at this time, allow them the time when they want to. Thank you Professor Ford for your civic duty.
The trauma of a sexual assault lasts forever. It impacts every part of your life. This is the truth.
I didn't want to tweet during Professor Ford's remarks. I wanted to listen to her, I wanted to hear her. I’m grateful for her bravery, so sorry for what she’s been through. I believe her. #IBelieveChristine
There is so much at stake this morning.  Professor Ford has said she believes it’s her civic duty to testify. It’s our civic duty to listen with respect.
Today may we listen, really listen.  May we have open minds.  May we all think for ourselves.  And when we go to comment may we be mindful of our words. Our words matter.
Love this @BetoORourke. Classy and respectful. This is the kind of politics we deserve in this country. Regardless of party, vote for people who raise the standards. https://t.co/WyEllVbX3O

Heartbreaking news today about @SenJohnMcCain. As an American, I am grateful to him for his service to our country until the very end.  My love goes out to his family. Let’s all take a moment and be kind to his family and all others battling cancer.

Optimism is what this #Alzheimers fight needs. We need better tools, more out-of-the-box thinking. Grateful to you @BillGates for your optimism and commitment, which goes way beyond money. Big thinkers are welcomed to this fight. https://t.co/SkEtDhOi9N
This is so inspiring. Bravo to these women. They’re showing us what courage looks like and reminding us we are not alone. https://t.co/pUtUVTJ8mH

"Wouldn’t"—I’m using the right word—that be great? ✅ We’ve got a lot to do in this country. Let’s get it done. ✅ And let’s allow the intelligence community to do its job. They say the Russia threat is real. Take their word. ✅The above are real. Let’s do something.Waiting.(3/3)
Millions and millions of Americans are unpaid caregivers. They need help. ✅ Kids are going to school scared. They need to feel safe. ✅ Teachers use their paychecks to buy supplies. C’mon. ✅  Millions of Americans want common sense gun reform. ✅ (2/3)
What we know now: Russia interfered. ✅ They will do it again. ✅ Millions of Americans are working and living paycheck to paycheck.  They need help. ✅ People are being diagnosed with #Alzheimers every 65 seconds. They and their families need help. ✅ (1/3)

Thank you @BillGates, I believe we can do this. We must do this.  It’s personal, professional and political — not just for those with Alzheimer’s but also for the millions of caregivers in our country. Here’s an open invitation to all who want to join in this fight. We need you. https://t.co/eqN5VyPSyI

Trump said Putin was very powerful in his denial of meddling. Powerful denial is something the president does himself all the time. #TrumpPutinHelsinki
There are bullies that even other bullies are afraid of—just saying.
Struck by all the reporters reporting out of the #TrumpPutinSummit. This is a defining moment for those of us who care about facts, truth and our country’s standing.
So much going on this am. The president calls the United States foolish. This is indeed a moment for all of us to step back and assess our loyalty to country @JeffFlake. https://t.co/Cl8blpdeV1

@JeanieBuss is a smart, savvy woman. @Lakers get @KingJames, maybe @Yg_Trece and we are back in the game. You can’t believe I’m commenting on free agent status lol
So @KingJames is not exercising his option. Moms this means he’s a free agent just in time for the Fourth of July!! Stick with me here because I think I actually know what I’m talking about. Like I said earlier this week, I think he’s coming here to LA to build up the @Lakers.

This is a moment to be heard. Speak, or forever hold your peace. https://t.co/qyeDIMEgLx
So, let’s not lose our minds as we use our voices. Voices that are raised with confidence and certainty can be heard. Voices that scream and rage often fall on deaf ears. So, may we raise up. May we speak out. May we speak from our hearts without losing our minds.
We are a nation of immigrants. We have been here before. Your relatives and mine have been here before. There is a way forward.
I know our immigration policy needs to be reformed. We have been saying this for years, and I know it’s complex, complicated, and hard. But I know it can be done and will get done. Because I know who we are. We are a nation of people with hearts and souls...
I know our collective good. I believe the majority of us are outraged at what we are seeing and hearing. I know this will stop. I know the collective voices are having an impact. I know the rest of the world hears our voices and cries out in unison with us...
This is what I’ve heard others ask at dinner tables, on social media, on TV, radio and wherever conversations are occurring. Full-hearted people are asking, “Who are we at this moment in time?”  I step back, close my eyes, and take a deep breath. I know who we are...
...with the news out of immigration centers, with the photographs of children wailing alone — scared, crying, screaming for their parents. Who have we become? Who are we? This is what I’ve asked myself over and over this week....
I’ve tried to imagine being separated and not knowing where my child was for days on end. It would be torture. I think it would drive me insane. That’s what I fear is happening to all of us. I feel like everyone is losing their minds. It’s easy to do in this news cycle...
It’s been a brutal week for people with hearts. People who feel. People who believe in our shared humanity. People who have held children in their arms. I’ve closed my eyes numerous times this week and tried to imagine someone pulling my child from my hold...
Smart fact check @craigmelvin. One administration rules it heartless, not who we are. The next does it and blames the former for it. Know your facts. https://t.co/Lc4ORrnAL9
I tweeted this yesterday. I haven't heard an answer @IvankaTrump. Step up or step down. https://t.co/TrV5qq4Avm
Amen my friend @SRuhle. As I’ve said @IvankaTrump should speak up or step down. Does she have any power with her father? She maintains she does, so... https://t.co/dTa5Q5pokR
Welcome to the independents. We are glad you are here @SteveSchmidtSES! https://t.co/TbBauphXqb
Now would be a good time for Ivanka Trump to show what it means to be an advisor on women’s issues, a proponent of female empowerment. You can’t be an advocate for women, mothers and not speak up about what is happening to women and children at this moment. #KeepFamiliesTogether

If the last week or so has taught us anything, it’s that people are super fragile. All of us are, at one point or another. It’s hard to know what’s really going on inside the hearts and minds of others, including those we care about most... https://t.co/ve8yJsr3yz
So excited that @Variety is saying @takeyourpills @netflix is one of the best films of 2018 yippee @CSchwarzenegger! #TakeYourPills https://t.co/kamUncSwez
Honored to share my personal journey with #Alzheimers in @MediaplanetUSA Stories’ Fighting Alzheimer’s Campaign. Learn what inspires me, the @womensalz, why I work to fight this disease &amp;provide better caregiver support #BrainAwarenessMonth #MoveForMinds https://t.co/AH00Efoyks

Thank you for this. Definitely gonna get my unexpected on -- thanks for the inspiration. https://t.co/wA6LRuY67J
This is so illuminating @craigmelvin. It’s those small moments that kids remember. Happy Father’s Day weekend to all the guys trying to get it right. Keep at it! https://t.co/2NKRKbkkQG
This not who we are.
Yesterday I said to you, my fellow citizens, this is not who we are. Today, the weekend before Father’s Day I wonder who among us who are parents cannot condemn this? My fellow parents if these were our children what would be doing? All of these children are God’s children. https://t.co/jvV0uos4uJ
#LosAngeles: Dr. Ruth Benca, @MGH_8, Dr. Richard Isaacson, @bewellbykelly, @meditationbob. #SanFrancisco: @DrDaleBredesen, @NkechiNjaka, @lilysarafan and Dr. Sharon Sha. Thank you for helping to make our #MoveForMinds events with @womensalz @Equinox such a wonderful experience!

Wow. What Bible? Jesus preached love, acceptance, treat each other with love and compassion. I’m having a hard time recognizing the country I was raised in. https://t.co/dcMjPuJar9
Well said @bobbyshriver. And history will be hard on us as well, unless we collectively denounce it. https://t.co/1ng4CAUpzo
My fellow Americans, this is not who we are. Children caged like animals? Unacceptable. Barbaric. What are we doing? Who have we be come? https://t.co/s4d2WoZma9
Bravo to you! Gotta love this story. Doesn’t matter where you come from. It only matters where you are going. https://t.co/Bj2cYIk3D9
I have no idea how this works and I know I’m not a teen, but I am a proud mama! https://t.co/RDTS2aTyZd
Omg, this is so exciting! Vote for @PSchwarzenegger! https://t.co/u7F1DQznpo
This is stunning to me, and it must be to all of us. https://t.co/5S6Taob1ev
So honored that Jason Rosenthal shared his story with me for @TODAYshow. Watch our conversation, then be sure to check out his emotional new TED Talk as well. https://t.co/4FS6lW0vht
Ten years ago wow. Remember it like it was ten seconds ago. Life is short, make today memorable. He was a giant worth remembering at a time when good journalism is so important. https://t.co/dtos7JsiWb https://t.co/zyErfWXcFO
...that are scientifically proven to improve your brain. I recently caught up with my friend Dr. Richard Isaacson, where we discussed the health benefits of doing BrainHQ cognitive training. Watch our conversation to learn more: https://t.co/7Fh6r6uDe1

So take a deep breath today don’t yell at someone, don’t shame them, belittle, or judge or for that matter, don’t tell them to just get it together. Just act like you are a volunteer at a crisis hotline. Listen. Talk. Help. https://t.co/hBjIMawKFB
Thanks to all those who volunteer to staff these hotlines and provide help to those in crisis. Keep in mind that many people who look fine on the outside are in crisis on the inside.
Happy birthday to Mr. President @GeorgeHWBush! Thank you for your service to our country and happy early Father's Day to you.
Truth. #TuesdayThoughts via @Word_Porm https://t.co/Ym1zGqcWbQ
Well done @rosemcgowan. Blame never helped anyone —so true. This conversation is for sure needed across generations. Peace within is the desired goal. Blessings. https://t.co/BDD0ZBiDBF
Well said @tonyschwartz. Couldn’t agree more. Let’s try to emulate what we want to see and hear. https://t.co/ykK43JSgy6
Thank you to all of our experts who joined us at #MoveForMinds @womensalz @Equinox! If you want to learn a lot from the best in the business on brain health and Alzheimer’s please follow my Facebook page and watch these compelling conversations: https://t.co/twOYwGnji6
Bravo to you. We need trained journalists. Bravo. https://t.co/kknFsDact8
Yes, yes, yes @kaitlancollins. What’s become of us that people cheer this man, take selfies with him? People remember. https://t.co/Tpyk1eDya3
Let’s be clear. No one has your voice. No one has your opinion. No one has your individual take. Your take on life is just as valid and just as important as someone else’s. Yes, that’s true. Read more of what #IveBeenThinking in my Sunday Paper today: https://t.co/J8GAd4HoWq
If you're in the San Francisco area, I hope you'll join me Sunday afternoon at the Bloomingdale's on Market Street! I'll be signing copies of "I've Been Thinking..." from 2:30-3:30pm and 10% of tracked sales in the store throughout the day will be donated to @womensalz! https://t.co/FiVIQgT5cz
Hi @AlanFeldstein. Thanks for the nudge. I do respond as much as I can mainly on Facebook and Instagram —will try harder on twitter nice to meet you! https://t.co/SLhhraFFEc
Love this especially the part to check on your strong friends, too @amandadecadenet. https://t.co/rW4z5GobQM
Yes, yes the perfect graduation book book @KSchwarzenegger! I just graduated now what? How about come join me and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s. https://t.co/lPOZb9odg7
I’ve always loved horses, they were my passion as a little girl. Nothing better than seeing a horse so beautiful do such a beautiful, historic thing. History made. Triple crown bravo, Justify! https://t.co/oXUlb9q9lr
As a mother this really hit me @MiaFarrow. I’ve been openly talking to my kids about their mental health, emotional health and spiritual health. My phone is always on, my heart is always open. I’m in call 24/7. What else should we do, what else can we do? https://t.co/vErtLOTsin
Join me LIVE at #MoveForMinds with the @womensalz @Equinox in #LosAngeles! Join the conversation featuring @MGH_8, Dr. Ruth Benca, Dr. Richard Isaacson, @bewellbykelly, @meditationbob and why we're fighting to help wipe out #Alzheimers disease. https://t.co/bJEtzg7aN9
Today move one baby step out of your lane. Say hi to someone in the line at Starbucks. Maybe even buy them a coffee.  Call someone you haven't spoken to in awhile. Ask someone for help. I know that’s hard -- do it anyway Move out of your lane.
Wow. Never doubt the impact you can have on another person @moneyries. https://t.co/kPcHimezij
How beautiful. On a tough day of news watch this:  https://t.co/N7dOXgkVs7
Wow thank you for sharing @lizzieohreally. https://t.co/y70YuUn2XX
I’m so sorry @yashar. And I’m so relieved you got help from him. Your voice is needed. Please take care of you. https://t.co/gUQ6cEqLdN
There are lives behind these numbers. Reach out today. Don’t wait for someone to call you. You call someone. https://t.co/TorLi1ijEE
Truth. @matthewjdowd https://t.co/tIIh0dzukU
...what we see on social media and TV isn’t the whole picture. Talk about mental health, reach out. Build strong foundations, make it clear to those you love that you are available and without judgement. Try to help others with what they need. Don’t judge others just help them.
Interesting that my boys have reacted so strongly to the Anthony Bourdain news. For them he was super cool. He had a great job, looked like he was having a blast, then this. Teaching moment for us all. As I say to my kids almost daily...
Now please everyone, especially those of us in the media, do what she asks. It’s not our business. Allow people their time. https://t.co/CMOyBse07Q
Yes, yes, yes @GavinNewsom yes. Brain health, mental health, emotional health, spiritual health. We all need support, love, kindness and community. https://t.co/CDsdENKT3w
Ironic given that this week we are witnessing how hard life is for so many, how long so many people have to battle their demons, their health struggles for years. This is just brutal, insensitive and unacceptable @larry_levitt. https://t.co/iB32DLbNp7
This is important: https://t.co/Lq8M5Lt4th
Every person carries pain. Even those we think have everything. It’s my experience that we all have to reach out more, pick up the phone, check in on people. Social media masks the truth of people’s lives @KayWarren1. https://t.co/bSgZgjmoxS
Woke up to such heartbreaking news. I sense we all need to take a collective deep breath. People are in real pain, struggling every day, sitting next to us in offices, walking next to us. People are so, so alone, isolated, sad. Please reach out be kind be gentle to everyone. https://t.co/mbixy5gP2c
Congrats to my friend @TedLeonsis, owner of the @Capitals! He’s the best and invested in his team and town.
Bravo to the Capitals! Best thing going on in DC. Bravo!
Struck by the president's comments re: preparation. Not much to prepare, he says. It’s about 'attitude,' he says. Wow. I tell myself and my kids it’s all about preparation.  Preparation. Preparation.  Trust me — the others are bringing their A-game. https://t.co/NQMx06vWee
No yikes here @maggieNYT! More like good for you and super great of her/her office. This says don’t speak for me. Warning to not just Giuliani. https://t.co/0bwgNWUdrS
I love this finding. I love that it conveys trust and hope for a better country. https://t.co/dCvQw5acBv via @nbcnews
Love this for its truth and the lesson it conveys! Gotta get closer. Further away may feel more comfortable but gotta get closer. Thanks for the note @bobgoff! https://t.co/oXqRdYNKhM
This is heartbreaking and infuriating @BobShrum. Imagine now the trauma that this young boy will live with. https://t.co/pUxGIizdl0
Bless the Broken Road @rascalflatts! https://t.co/4aHg8bX8b9
So honored and thrilled about this partnership with @HCAssistance @womensalz! Caregivers deserve this. https://t.co/x9OmLuExvM
Good for you, for saying you will continue this work and for recognizing those who have been at it for years @KimKardashian. Go forward together! https://t.co/17z0kzIIW0
The face of a survivor. Today, as always, I'm thinking of my aunt and how she persevered and kept her husband's legacy alive. Amazing triumph. https://t.co/hj0jbsiZR5
Thank you for this important reminder @dhookstead. So true. Thank you. 🙏 https://t.co/zNln8Xc7cf
Now that’s a photo @RepJoeKennedy @DoloresHuerta @Emma4Change. Everyone in it is using their voice for good. https://t.co/Z70P1pkP2O
This story will inspire you and make you laugh. And please if you know anyone with Alzheimer's or caring for someone with #Alzheimers pass this story forward. https://t.co/vVolofO8RL
Love it. News cycle needs more of stories like this @craigmelvin. https://t.co/ikCE3tZq9j
Congratulations @ZachWahls! I was so impressed when I first heard you. Now look at you. Bravo! https://t.co/0dH05hgCia
I want to live in a country that values justice for all — not just for those who can afford it.  My list goes on.  What’s yours? https://t.co/mE7jXECpkx
I want to live in a country where you can grow old with dignity. I want to live in a country that values the value of care, caring for one another, caring for parents, caring for loved ones.
I want to live in a country whose political leaders speak to one another with respect, with decency and honor. I want to live in a country that asks all of its citizens to serve, to serve one another, to serve their neighborhoods.
50 years later it would serve us all well to ask ourselves today at this moment: What kind of country do we want to live in? I know the answer to this. I want to live in a country that respects and values all its citizens.
Good for you @KimKardashian — For using your voice for a higher purpose. https://t.co/7JI2NvBwzl
It wasn’t that long ago that a White House invite was THE most prestigious invite anyone could get. https://t.co/koaubEKSU3
It’s time to let people who are alive know how you feel about them—as in today, as in right now. Pick up the phone, visit someone. Check-in.
Struck as always by the outpouring of love that greets people when they pass. I suspect Kate Spade had no clue how admired, loved and respected she was.
Absolutely I agree. @davidhogg111 https://t.co/SRCaCtedzj
Life is precious. In a minute it can all change. So find your mission, find your purpose and get on with it — the world needs you.
Each of us can use our words to heal, to bridge, to inspire. On this day that’s what I’m thinking about and as always on this day I say a prayer for my Aunt Ethel who has carried on and my cousins who do as well.
Today many are marking the anniversary of my uncle’s death. I want to focus on his life and not his death: If you can read one of his speeches, check out some of his quotes. The world he envisioned is still waiting to be realized.  Each of us can be a force for good.
And so in California we have a Democrat versus a Republican for the governor's race in November. #CaliforniaPrimary #elections https://t.co/1YhJ9d7nGO
Uh oh. This is going to be a long night. https://t.co/Fy0VwXdvHa
This is a story that stopped me. It’s a wow. He donated his money to teach kids compassion, civility and so many more values that we all need to learn. Bravo to you, sir. https://t.co/hfIwXGxbbY
Yes, yes and yes @cmclymer. Teaches us all to pause and realize that we don’t know what goes on inside people. So be gentle. Be compassionate. Be kind. https://t.co/w6sPfoqMjV
Me too @schwartzbCNBC. Bring that back, along with manners, decency, integrity, nobility and care for all our citizens. https://t.co/Pi4QFytCzc
Did you vote yet? Today is the #PrimaryElection in California and I want to encourage all of you in every state with elections happening to get out there, vote and make your voices heard. You can make a difference. #vote https://t.co/nv3xsWrzbW
Correction: My* heart goes out to Kate Spade's family. May we all take note that we never know what goes on in someone’s life. Be kind to people today, even those you think have it all. https://t.co/1UW8SkshI8
Me heart goes out to Kate Spade's family. May we all take note that we never know what goes on in someone’s life. Be kind to people today, even those you think have it all. https://t.co/1SFbSRfQK6
Bravo to you such a big achievement @samafbaby!! https://t.co/S2LYh6cguR
So In the last day the Eagles got disinvited from the White House, Howard Shultz stepped down as @Starbucks CEO to think about how he can be of service. The First Lady reportedly reappeared and Paul Manafort is going to have a rough night. I’m sure I’m missing something.
Lordy Moses as my friend says Lordy Moses. Just when we thought nothing more could happen today. Buckle your seat belts. https://t.co/JhfrNB30D6
Thank you ladies @TheBethPhoenix @NatbyNature! I hope that means im in your circle of friends. https://t.co/QzbIMCv01Q

Thank you @kristatippett @onbeing! I'm grateful for our conversation, too. I enjoyed our discussion about #IveBeenThinking and appreciate your voice. https://t.co/0o3CSlYL9S https://t.co/uEGFOaZ9B7
Smart statement @brianstelter. Truthful and thoughtful. https://t.co/XlK9Du6nM8
Howard Schultz of @Starbucks is off and running. I’m not a betting person but I’d bet on this and I for one think that’s a good thing. I look forward to his voice in the political space on leadership, healthcare and education. https://t.co/0oNnFkS0h6
Both parties should be on alert in #California. Californians need a party that addresses everyday life: the cost of it and the reality of it. Both parties are losing traction. #CaliforniaPrimary https://t.co/Sk5bfiXgtf
And I see you @StaffGirlVA. You are not alone. We need leaders to see that you exist and to make your situation front and center. It’s a holistic way to look at healthcare, the economy and everyday lives. It's up to us to get this issue front and center. #caregivers #Alzheimers https://t.co/r7djKUZ05N
Women listen up. You are more vulnerable to #Alzheimers. Your brain is your most valuable resource. I’m going to say it over and over again and share news that you can use it. Voila: https://t.co/4mDh6MLP1a
Yes staggering @Juliegreb. And staggering to me that none of  leaders in #CaliforniaPrimary mention this to us. #Alzheimers https://t.co/3nLa65EGu8
Listening to Greg O'Brien is so deeply moving and inspiring. He may have Alzheimer’s but he is also a working journalist and his reporting from the frontlines of this disease is a public service for our entire country: https://t.co/eSaJ8pLTle
Every 65 seconds someone in the U.S. develops Alzheimer’s and 2/3 are women. If California gets smart about either of those we will not only solve one of our biggest challenges but we can also lead in the nation. https://t.co/Np4K7lgyB8
I know and respect many of the people on this @sacbee_news #election list. That said, I’m disappointed that no one thought the growing number of those living with #Alzheimers and caregivers are among our state’s biggest issues...
Agreed regarding @itstonybennett @cmarinucci but please look at the woman in the corner, the unstoppable Charlotte Shultz who made that honor happen. https://t.co/4nIDNwjN0R
Full stop! Full speed ahead for Steve Schmidt. The man tells it straight. Listen up. https://t.co/h21pDhoPRd

That’s right ❤️ @NatbyNature!  Keep staying the course. Good way to start the new week. Keep on it. https://t.co/PgqwWvCDd6
So true @nytopinion! We call women crazy. We call them hormonal and we don’t even bother to fund basic research into women’s health. Time for such degrading language to stop. https://t.co/TbNP8S2yiJ
But, if I’ve learned anything, it’s that stuff happens when it’s supposed to in our lives, not always when we think it should... Read more of what #IveBeenThinking in my Sunday Paper today: https://t.co/OfiTZu4KCU
I think so many of us are in a rush these days. We’re in a rush to get on with things. A rush to get over things. A rush to be where we think we are supposed to be.

You know what they say @cmarinucci... As California goes, so goes the rest of the nation. This rise in our state should concern both parties — not just Republicans. https://t.co/n1n8brWWhw
The best! Made me cry @yashar https://t.co/HoslVCCWSG
Agreed @AsteadWesley. https://t.co/dFx6D1Umjb
Another teachable moment today. This figure, this fact stopped me cold. We saw today that words matter. Facts also matter. Most of all lives matter. https://t.co/TW8WoCHzf5
Today words mattered. Bravo again @ABC for a swift decisive response. Today also gives all of us a teachable moment @ValerieJarrett. We will need many more but good to take advantage of them as they come along.
Words matter! https://t.co/Ujbqa6g8cz
Rivka is a Gold Star mother and her story about her son Cole will move you. Thank you Rivka for your sacrifice and your courage.  Read her story in this week’s Sunday Paper: https://t.co/wpNz3198rK
While many today go to the beach and enjoy family, may we stop to remember and give thanks to all who fought for our country and made the ultimate sacrifice. With their lives and or their loved ones lives. This is Rivka Bent and her late son Cole. https://t.co/tIilJTmgkj

On this Saturday, may we once again salute those using their voices to create change be it in Ireland or here at home. Every day is a chance to begin a new today. May we add our voices to denounce the separation of children from their parents on our borders. Begin anew.
This is so true @katiebrown_10 and when we criticize, demean, judge it takes a lifetime to undue. Surround yourself with those who bring you up. https://t.co/NfcCEcfvLi

Amazing images out of New York this morning. Unthinkable not too long ago. Unthinkable today were it not for courageous women and intrepid reporting @RonanFarrow. https://t.co/G9jAUpTPi5
I’m just saying you are one awesome brother, son, reporter @RonanFarrow. This statement gave me chills. Bravo your voice matters. https://t.co/dyByIECNnI
This is only happening because brave women stepped up and used their voices and never gave up. This is a moment I’m sure very few ever thought could happen. Women’s voices forcing change.  Wow. https://t.co/u2DhTkOXLy
On so many women’s health issues the answer is ‘We don’t know why that is.’ We need to step up our research on women’s health whether it’s Alzheimer’s or lung cancer. I for one am committed to getting answers — not ‘we don’t knows.’ https://t.co/TU7CymiI64
I’m blessed with healthy children. So many of my fellow citizens are not. Thank you @KSchwarzenegger for bringing this to my attention. Count me in. https://t.co/RuKkfsClW1

Smart idea @shorteducate. I find myself constantly disappointed in the NFL when it comes to just about everything: Brain trauma, helping families who are then caregiving for life, abuse, the list goes on. https://t.co/g9tpkaquF1
Join me LIVE tomorrow 5/24 with @CristinaCooks on #ArchitectsOfChange at 11:30AM PST. Don't miss it! We're making blueberry cobbler — can't wait to try it! https://t.co/mLXoIWwyHR https://t.co/VYFLzF05FD
Agree with this sentiment @HRC. It's worth noting how long change takes and how you have to stay the course. Staying the course is what makes the difference. #HarveyMilkDay https://t.co/DKQ5ycBqdD
My son @CShriver573 sent this in our family chat. I totally agree @kanyewest. https://t.co/KSxkKa1Q7I

This is a forceful speech given with strength, purpose and confidence. A true moment of bravery. https://t.co/HX6zwZrRMx
Preach @shannonrwatts preach. https://t.co/7I2L2IJntn
Amen. Thought the same thing as I watched her sitting alone, comfortable, strong, elegant and calm. Wow wow wow! https://t.co/uWOdJc4Bgc
Healing can, and does, happen when people want it to. It can happen when people believe it’s possible and when they see another example of healing that inspires them.  Read more of what #IveBeenThinking in my Sunday Paper newsletter today: https://t.co/17RPAgTyJz
I always had great admiration and empathy for Princess Diana. Today I can’t help but think about her. What a job she did with these young men. Strong, kind, elegant, loving —they keep their mother front and center after all these years. What a triumph.
I love this. Her face, her elegance, her strength. At the end of this day I’m focusing on love in all its forms.  It’s what moves us all forward. https://t.co/nG2uwiES67
This is an awesome choice. My mother won this award last year. This award is about courage, love, righteous anger and social change.  These women are trailblazers. https://t.co/HYREBhmZ0z
Love the couple.  Love that he opened the door for her. Love the car. Love the love. https://t.co/sJDkijjK75
Go out today and be a light. Show your love. Stand by someone. Stand up for someone. That’s amazing. We are all amazing.
Takeaways: The power of love — it can change the world... Amen. Who doesn’t need that? We all deserve love, even second chances at it. We all deserve someone to stand by us to stand up for. Love knows no color, no zip code, no boundaries. https://t.co/Qd9z3XZLBp
That’s the world I’m constantly imagining everyday — not just on a wedding day. Trying to turn imagination into reality. https://t.co/HxUZE9H8Gb
Just keep watching this over and over today. When you lose hope watch it again and again. https://t.co/V0zMC4ZWM6
This and the song “Stand by me.”  Love is the healing we are all in need. Wherever you are today I hope you have someone to stand by you and I hope you renew your commitment to love. https://t.co/ec6L7pHWhG
This is a huge, make-a-difference action. What a loving move. https://t.co/fXTf8xDF4r

Has anyone thought it’s worth thinking about what is happening to our boys, our young men? Isn’t that a conversation we should be having as well?
Great idea, great thought moving us forward @lexforchange. So many for me to mention! https://t.co/nY2vw3sYbD
Not normal to me.  Not going to get used to this. Never ever. I know once gun violence has touched your family you never ever get over it. Never.  C'mon let’s focus on this one thing and make a difference. #GunReform https://t.co/F3ZR9Ux28Q
Watching @AndrewPollackFL, father of Meadow, who was killed in Parkland shooting, use his voice tonight again on TV. Thank you Mr. Pollack for your strength, your voice.

Really ? Really ? @realDonaldTrump  Please Mr. President focus on one thing that will make a difference in the lives of everyone in every state in our country: gun reform. Do it now.  We can’t be great until this gets done. https://t.co/uvq1VAt9tj
I’ve said it before @Alyssa_Milano. Will say it again.  Don’t vote for someone in the NRA.  Don’t support those who go and speak at their conventions to rally support. We the majority of men and women want this violence to stop now.  We are fed up. https://t.co/bw3CJv1oOR
Horrible. ⚡️ “As many as 10 dead and 10 injured in Texas school shooting, officials say” https://t.co/fYPf6spkEq
It feels impossible and surreal that here we are yet again. But here we are yet again. I know many say we don't need your prayers, but it’s what I have at this moment. May we all recommit ourselves to doing what we can. https://t.co/TsWM7rqdBR
This is fact not fiction. So when people say, 'Oh look at the economy, everyone’s doing so well.' — Um no... they are not. Hard-working Americans can’t afford the basics. Yesterday the headline was teachers having to buy their own supplies... now this: https://t.co/dyzxEtoxxF

Interesting trend. Worth digging deeper to explain. Is this a financial decision? Is this that women feel they can’t get support from workplace? Interested in the why of this across all demographics.⚡️ Birth rate among US women drops to new all-time low: https://t.co/67VdA4F8Ci

Shame on us. https://t.co/Rwow4H3IWZ

Must-read for every parent @NBCNewsHealth. As a parent of twenty-somethings I hear all the time about anxiety, depression, pressure and no time to disconnect. Note to self here: dig deep, talk, connect. https://t.co/Z007IWWeSn
Once again @Pontifex is correct. Violence never leads to peace—not abroad, not here at home or in our homes. Let’s commit to being healers in our own lives. Let’s elect healers. Let’s raise up the voices of healers. Let us be the change. https://t.co/CWLXs8QwRO
It’s women’s health week. It's critical for women to be educated about sex differences because our doctors rarely are. Headaches and migraines are no joke. Don’t let anyone make fun of you for them. There is a real reason you have them. Get educated. https://t.co/Hn2IYqvKxh
This is an oh my god, stop in your tracks moment.  332 women and girls  332 women and girls  It’s on all of us to make sure this doesn’t happen anywhere anymore. https://t.co/dTqYQNFaUx
When my mother had a stroke in my home, knowing this helped me know what was happening. Smart to know @MayoClinic. https://t.co/0EefJKKK0T
My heart goes out to Meghan Markle. Weddings are stressful enough. I hope her mother walks her down the aisle! That would just be awesome.
I really like Nikki @BellaTwins. Think she’s a special woman. May she find her way May we let them find their way. ⚡️ “John Cena says he still wants to marry Nikki Bella” https://t.co/kdMswPV0Wi
To see such violence in such a holy place makes me pause. I often feel I’m watching different realities in real time, it feels like one has no clue about the other. I’m motivated to do more to understand how I can use my voice to bridge the divide around me. #MondayMotivation https://t.co/mqM3L9mrVx
Happy Mother’s Day to all those who mother, who nurture, who guide, who love unconditionally, who keep going. Even when it’s hard they just stay at it. Gotta love motherhood.
Once you commit to motherhood, you are always in mother-mode. You are always on the line and always on-call. And, that’s fine with me, as I find motherhood endlessly fascinating... Read more of what #IveBeenThinking in my Sunday Paper newsletter: https://t.co/26VABH1eeW https://t.co/NZySKaH6su

Mothers as optimists. They are behind us all, pushing us forward when we doubt ourselves @tomfriedman. To push for change you must have hope. I thank my mother for her hope her optimism and her fury. https://t.co/T0PdMigZYL
This is about so much more than being disinvited from a philanthropy summit @mekosoff @MonicaLewinsky. It’s a thought-provoking read and it’s written with strength and without shame. That’s a big mountain that she climbed. https://t.co/T1nIBwmjzS

We have lost our manners, our compassion, our empathy. That’s what I feel bad about. That said I believe there are more good people than those who make the noise.
I actually feel bad for us as a country. I feel badly that we have lost our decency. We have forgotten how to respectfully disagree. https://t.co/ZEjzccofnc
Couldn’t agree more. How do we change this? I’m serious. How about manners 2.0? How about a compassion initiative? https://t.co/HB5sYkEz86
Old women? Did I read that right? https://t.co/6hG8krpYeH
I’d be in that third category. Independents will soon surpass Republicans. I wish we could all coalesce under the the party of us or independent party. Nonetheless, this group needs to be taken seriously. https://t.co/FG6KVBiKzQ

Beautiful statement on Barbara Bush from President George W. Bush. Mothers should keep their sons on their toes. And how beautiful to have a settled soul. It's something we should all aspire to. Amen. https://t.co/ylXNEb8OXA
Barbara Bush served her country with class. She served her family with love and compassion. I’m grateful I knew her. And as an American, I'm grateful for her service. My heart goes out to her husband, children, great-grandchildren and the entire crew. A life beautifully lived. https://t.co/WUuQgo8iBF

Not feeling like you belong creates loneliness, unhappiness, fear and anxiety . And I must say, I feel like I’ve been having lots of conversations lately... (1/2)
What saves us in anxious times like these is our sense of community + belonging. What will save us is making changes to how we approach our lives, how we treat one another, and how we work together... Sign up to read more in my Sunday Paper: (2/2) https://t.co/kOwhwRp3pl https://t.co/XFbwSUV3Cs
#IveBeenThinking quite a bit lately about belonging. I know a lot of people feel lost and disconnected right now. We hear on TV and from our politicians that we’re more divided than ever. But I don't believe that, and I don't think you should either. (1/2)
I never take a sight like this for granted. Wherever you are I hope it’s calm, it’s peaceful, and you feel as though you belong there. https://t.co/XRLVYp81iV

#IveBeenThinking that we can pick our attitudes. We decide when we want to change things. If I imagine something, then it’s up to me to make it happen. And as Dr. Maya Angelou says, if you don’t like something, then it’s up to you to change it. #MondayMeditation https://t.co/WhMbHpaB5k

People of all ages have fear. Fears of failing. Fears of failing their children. Fears about their jobs, their health, and about letting go. In the past, fear has occasionally gotten the best of me. I’ve come to realize that fear is no match for my own internal strength. (1/2)

Recently, #IveBeenThinking about passion and purpose. We each have talent and skills that make us incredibly unique. It’s how we tap into those gifts, share them with others and connect with each other that matters most. It’s about how open our hearts truly are. #MondayMeditation https://t.co/BytY4iWJF4
I'm in Texas now for my new book #IveBeenThinking so I’ve been thinking how awesome this is: There's a primary here tomorrow with at least 50 women running, but all of these women have already made a impact by stepping up speaking out. Bravo! https://t.co/1WesrI9Q0T
Love this. So powerful. Words matter, as do visions. https://t.co/7VJCoklo1L

I read this piece on the plane in @USATODAY. It's a piece of joint reporting by them and @KHNews. It’s terrifying, upsetting and disturbing. If you are headed for a surgery at a surgical center read this before you go: https://t.co/sUA6GzfyC8

#IveBeenThinking just how powerful kindness is. It uplifts us. It changes us. It surrounds us. We need to spread it. We need to teach it. And we absolutely need to live it. As Cleo Wade says, kindness can be the profound force that changes our world. #MondayMeditation https://t.co/tDMI8FdxJN

Great. I’m in. See you there. https://t.co/EmDSTvRyAZ
It doesn’t matter what you give up for Lent. Your relationship with whatever has a hold on you will change, no matter what it is. I wondered: what vice do I have that has too much of a hold on me? Read more of what #IveBeenThinking in my Sunday Paper: https://t.co/WnYEw4HzFd
Today I watched @SpecialOlympics athletes and @NBA , @WNBA All Stars playing together. Unified. We can, together, unified, follow their lead. https://t.co/JJPm61aGxf
This week, #IveBeenThinking about self-doubt and how it's bad for our physical, mental and spiritual health. Read more in my Sunday Paper email newsletter tomorrow: https://t.co/kOwhwRp3pl https://t.co/0eYwcVsVj7
Well said and true. https://t.co/WtfBUnCMED
Let’s get more counselors in schools. Let’s make the internet abide by some rules. Yes, let’s do this ASAP. Let’s tell Congress to act like first responders and get the job done. (5/5)
Let’s take a page from the first responders. Let’s go in and get something done. Let’s work on sensible gun reform. (4/5)
In my morning meditation I kept thinking of them, of the students, of the families. I keep thinking about us. The small us, the big us. (3/5)
As a citizen, I’m continuously humbled by the bravery of first responders. They go in and they risk it all for us. Total strangers. The best of us in the worst of times. We don’t know their names. We don’t see their faces. We don’t sit with what they saw or experienced. (2/5)
Today will always be the "day after" for families and students in Parkland, Florida. It will also always be the "day after" for first responders. (1/5)
Listening to former congressman David Jolly tonight following the tragic shooting in Florida. Wow. He explains his transformation on this issue and says Republicans will not fix this. He tells all of us to work for incremental change. https://t.co/ywA9hmL01a
What, might I ask, is it going to take for us to look at our young men in this country and say we have a national crisis? There is no doubt about this. What can we do to make this our last school tragedy instead of just another school and family tragedy? (2/2)
I know it’s Valentine’s Day, but the news out of Florida should rock all our worlds on this day. All of us should be outraged and shocked. What, might I ask, is it going to take for us to enact sensible gun reform? (1/2)
It’s so easy these days to just scroll by a story like this. But this is developing and we should pay attention. There are families in fear and people injured. They need to know that we are thinking of them and supporting them. https://t.co/yGohvcUUgi
Happy Valentine's Day! We could all benefit from giving a little more love these days. Here's some #WednesdayWisdom from my upcoming book, #IveBeenThinking. Pre-order your copy! https://t.co/jLsaeGrfU7 https://t.co/pohxOhbOp0
Today is about love. It comes in all shapes and sizes. It’s nurturing, it’s uplifting, it’s healing and it’s confirming. It's also the beginning of Lent. I’m giving up self doubt. There is nothing more loving than believing in yourself, surrounded with people who believe in you.
How do you really get through to your loved one? Relationship expert Terry Real says we can radically change our relationships by changing how we communicate. His advice in this week's Sunday Paper: https://t.co/T3J5qQJ48C
God speed. Interesting that he broke his silence to tell this story. Everyone has a story. Allow them the time they need to tell it, to heal, to recover. Good luck young man. https://t.co/lFG6fpKjZ2
My father said this in 1957. It needs to be reiterated in 2018. Because today we need to lead from a place of love and compassion. That’s strength. That’s us. https://t.co/1BPsnhEQJl
The uphill battle of rebirth. It’s beautiful, as rebirth is where the light is. As Lent begins this week, let this be a good reminder not to give up or doubt one’s self. That’s way harder than giving up bread or sugar. Keep speaking, Jennie. https://t.co/ZHFD6Oi0NN
#IveBeenThinking about the fact that none of us truly know what is going on in the life of another human being. We make judgments all the time. And yet, we know nothing. What I do know for sure is that we all need love. Read more in my Sunday Paper. https://t.co/QQltdOrMN4
This week, #IveBeenThinking about love. What it is, and what it isn't. In these changing and turbulent times, I believe that real love is the best gift we can give each other. Read more in my Sunday Paper newsletter tomorrow. Sign up here: https://t.co/4R9W1iqKLE https://t.co/HjRcF3VDxV

This is super important. It stopped me cold. Kelly’s judgment should give us all pause, especially you know who... https://t.co/DXsaKkzfGL
I couldn't agree more! There are Architects of Change among us, and that's why my Sunday Paper newsletter is devoted to elevating the work they are doing to move humanity forward. That's something we can all do. https://t.co/kOwhwRp3pl https://t.co/hBKdb7e0wm

Watching former FBI agent Josh Campbell on @CNN. Smart. Solid. Insightful. A warning to us all: sowing doubt about the FBI hurts us as people and as a nation.
Americans shouldn't have to choose between their jobs and caring for a loved one. On this 25th anniversary of The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), we must call on our policymakers to do more to guarantee #paidleave for everyone. #FMLA25 #PaidLeaveMeans
As I wrote yesterday, I think we should all root for each other. Root for the greatness in each of us. Love this from one of my favorites, Rumi. #MondayMeditation https://t.co/LATrWpFb7P

Okay Patriots, do your thing! Boston strong!

"Out of many. One.  Ladies and gentlemen, have faith: The state of our union is hopeful, resilient, enduring." I so believe we are one. Great job, @RepJoeKennedy #SOTU #SOTUResponse
.@RepJoeKennedy mentioning #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter... President never mentioned either. #SOTU #SOTUResponse
"To the dreamers... We will fight for you. We will not walk away." Nice to hear @RepJoeKennedy make some of his remarks in Spanish, a former Peace Corps volunteer in Dominican Republic. #SOTU #SOTUResponse
"We choose a health care that offers you mercy." I love the word mercy because we all need it and understand it. #SOTU #SOTUResponse
"Here is the answer Democrats offer tonight: we choose both. We fight for both. ...Shouldn't leave anyone behind." @RepJoeKennedy #SOTU #SOTUResponse
"We are bombarded with false choices." This is so true. We have got to get to our common ground so we are not pitted against one another. #SOTU
Smart to do the response from a crowd of real people. #SOTU
.@RepJoeKennedy is idealistic. Committed, smart, focused and driven. A good man devoted to serving his country. #SOTU
Here we go @joekennedy! Talking to us from Fall River. A fitting place to gather to talk about our union. #SOTU
Gotta say, I love the stories of the people in the gallery. So inspiring. Such a great reminder of who this nation is. #SOTU
A moving story about Ryan and Rebecca, adopting their daughter Hope. So many great people in this country. #SOTU
Watching #SOTU I’m always struck by the divided chamber. Half sitting. No matter who is president. So divided.
"We have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government." Interesting. How many people feel this way? #SOTU
Me too. Agree with you https://t.co/PaRdp4K9TZ
It was my pleasure to sit down with @BillGates to talk about his fight against #Alzheimers and the Dementia Discovery Fund. @TODAYshow https://t.co/6tciyOWQ8J

Strong countries must be like strong families. They must be accepting. Otherwise they are fractured and divided.
Anyone brave enough to serve our country should be allowed to do so. That's how you build a common sense of purpose, identity &amp; strong home.

This holiday weekend, we can all take a time out, @POTUS included, away from phones &amp; Twitter. We must be kinder, be better and do better.
I'm all for free speech but I'm against speech that hurts, defames or is just rude… as my mother used to say, it’s “very unattractive."
Heading into the holiday weekend let's talk around our tables about the power of words. Free speech doesn't mean we have to defame others.
Oh yeah! Keep 'em coming. You both are wonderful human beings. Lucky them! https://t.co/pmCgxPepvP

Say a prayer for those whose lives are in the balance. Spread kindness and love wherever and whenever you can. You only have this moment.
If you are able, reach out to someone you love. You are lucky to be able to do that. If you are in a fight, reach out. Life is short.

We (and our country) need to stay the course. Breathe.
Today may we focus on what we can do to make our communities/country more conscious, more just, less party-focused &amp; more country-focused.
The country's system is at work. The press is doing its job. Checks and balances implemented long ago are working their magic.
It'll be a marathon for our country - a rollercoaster of emotions, facts, who said what &amp; knew what. Stay informed but keep your perspective

"Europe and the world: expect that we defend everywhere the spirit of Enlightenment." #Macron -- love that
"We have the strength, the energy and the will - and we will not give in to fear." Inspiring, Macron sets the bar high.
What a moving scene in Paris. This young man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Macron laying out the enormity of his challenge. Calls on everyone to join him. To be successful, it's what he needs. Good he asks for unity
The Macron victory in France says a lot about independence, vision &amp; courage. Political parties everywhere must reckon within.

President Trump spoke tonight with a different tone and different approach than the inaugural. Spoke to all of America. #JointAddress
Trump wraps up his speech. Worth reading if you didn't see or hear. Get engaged. #JointAddress https://t.co/d7yk3IeF7B
"...Guided by our vision, not blinded by out doubts." #JointAddress
Pres Trump outlines America he envisions. "Not too much to ask... This is our vision... our mission. We are one people, with one destiny."
"We know that America is better off when there is less conflict... We want peace, wherever peace can be found." We can all agree on this.
"My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States." Thoughts? #JointAddress
"Our veterans have delivered for this nation, now we must deliver for them." That's for sure. We need details. #JointAddress
Worth noting on eve of Women's History Month that majority living on brink are working women needing childcare, living wages, flexibility.
"To break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence." Amen #JointAddress
Always telling who the President's guests are in the balcony. It tells you a lot. #JointAddress
Beautiful story about perseverance about Megan Crowley &amp; her father. FDA process is slow. Trump is right about that. #JointAddress
"Find common ground to advance the common good..." How do people define common good? Thats where we need to start, define it &amp; move forward.
Pres Trump talking about paid family leave. It's important for all working families &amp; hope this includes caring for parents. #JointAddress
"Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed." Why not join forces &amp; get the job done? I think everyone wants that #JointAddress
Trump says those w/ pre-existing conditions should have coverage. This was big part of Obamacare. Let's credit him for that. #JointAddress
The "how" is in the details when it comes to repeal and replace. #JointAddress
Pres Trump mentions Lincoln and Eisenhower. I'm hoping he mentions a democrat president as well. #JointAddress
"I'm going to bring back millions of jobs." -- That will be music to millions of ears. #JointAddress
Trump says we must restart engine of the US economy &amp; make it harder for companies to leave. Seems everyone can agree on this. #JointAddress
Trump paints very bleak picture of country he inherited. Fascinating compared to one Obama described in his outgoing speech. #JointAddress
I'm always struck by these speeches. The way half the room gets up and half doesn't. How do we get by this? Suggestions? #JointAddress
Trump: "I want to... update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises." -- interesting use of I, not we. #JointAddress
"...we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate &amp; evil in all its forms." #JointAddress
Women in white in the house What are your thoughts regarding that? #jointsession
Pres Trump about to give 1st joint address. Very important moment for those in the building but mostly for those of us outside the building.

Watching two presidents side by side on TV, hard to wrap ones mind around such different visions, styles, tone, politics btwn them.
I was hoping for a vision that Obama's "we" and Trumps "we" can all get behind. I still hope for that.
Was hoping for language that would bring the two hands of our country together. Didn't hear it.
Love Joe Biden. Focusing on him getting on the train right now.
Wow, farewell to the Obamas. Struck me as farewell to his "we" as well. #InaugurationDay
We are a global community. I'm thinking this message will not be seen as an invitation to join us. #InaugurationDay
My takeaway is that there wasn't much there that is going to start unifying our country. Still struck by way he painted USA #InaugurationDay
So much of this day is about symbolism. I wish Pres Trump would have shaken Mrs Clinton's hand. #InaugurationDay
What struck me here is the division between Trump and Washington is very stark. #InaugurationDay
Trump is painting a picture of an America unattended to. Wonder what Obama and Biden thinking at this moment. #InaugurationDay
Thinking that Trumps "we" may be very different from Obama's "we" -- How do we become (us)? As in (United States) #InaugurationDay
Trump says going forward, America is now first. #InaugurationDay
"We are one nation. We share one heart, one home, one destiny. The oath I take today is allegiance to whole country." #InaugurationDay
"January 20, 2017 -- the day the people became the rulers of this nation again." #InaugurationDay
"This is your day. This is your celebration. This is your country" #InaugurationDay
The president paints a division from Washington DC to the rest of America - "This is your moment" #InaugurationDay
Today we are transferring power from Washington DC back to you the people. #InaugurationDay
We are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Obama -- they are magnificent #InaugurationDay
"Together we will determine the course of America" #inaugurationday
Here we go. Those who voted for this man and those who voted against, we all need to take a deep breath #InaugurationDay
Strikes me as so old fashion for Mrs. Trump to sit behind her husband. #InaugurationDay
Schumer: We live in challenging times w/ a fractured media. I am confident because of you the American people
I'm hopeful that for just a few minutes on social media &amp; in our real life discourse, we might all be kind &amp; might listen. #InaugurationDay
As Trump waits to walk down the steps, I pray the enormity of the job and what he is about to do has sunk in. #InaugurationDay
President Obama's final tweets reminding us he is a citizen, as we all are https://t.co/v8NImb2icm
Amazing to think that the oath of office and transfer of power goes back to 1789 #InaugurationDay
Wow! Wow! Wow! Donald Trumps walks out #InaugurationDay
First sight of Pres-Elect Trump. I feel is that he seems alone, standing alone. It can be a lonely job. #InaugurationDay
My heart goes out to Mrs Clinton and her family #InaugurationDay
Having been at both Obama inaugurations, it's a striking difference to me the makeup of the crowd #InaugurationDay
The final moments of the Obama/Biden presidency. Two classy men. #InaugurationDay
My friend sent me a note saying she went to church to light a candle tonight for our new president &amp; our country. I'll do the same. https://t.co/E0Qd7fIZpz

Never doubt the power of a beautiful speech. Elegant, calm, smart &amp; positive. #ObamaFarewell
My takeaway from this speech is that we must fight fear. We all have a role. We must embrace the role of citizenship. Politics can be better
So glad I voted for this man. So glad I witnessed this leader, husband and father. #ObamaFarewell
"Yes we did. Yes we can." We can all believe in our ability to create change #ObamaFarewell

"You did change the world... I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic than when we started." That is reassuring! #ObamaFarewell
"To my remarkable staff... You never let Washington get the best of you." The sign of a great leader. #ObamaFarewell
"To Joe Biden... You were the first decision I made as a nominee and it was the best." Yes it was! #ObamaFarewell
"Of all that I've done in my life I am most proud to be your dad." Wow, to hear your dad say that! #FarewellObama
"You have made me proud and you made the country proud." Love the way this president talks about his wife. So moving. #FarewellObama
"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life... Run for office. Show up. Dive in."
"For all our outward differences we in fact all share the same title... Citizen." #ObamaFarewell
"We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others... We sit back and blame leaders we elect." #obamafarewell
"We the people give it power." Yes this is on us. Our freedoms not assured. We all must be involved. #ObamaFarewell
"Let's be vigilant but not afraid." This is so important for all of us to remember. #ObamaFarewell
"Democracy can buckle when it gives into fear." Protecting our way of life is all of our responsibilities. Love this concept. #ObamaFarewell
"To all who serve or have served... we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude." Yes we do. Thank you. #ObamaFarewell
"Politics is a battle of ideas." We must have facts. Science and reason matter. #ObamaFarewell
"We all have to try harder." So true. I know I must try harder &amp; will try harder to reach out. We can all try harder. #ObamaFarewell
"We have to pay attention &amp; listen" I love this. So true. Btwn races &amp; genders &amp; beyond. Must all walk in each other's shoes. #ObamaFarewell
"Hearts must change." So agree with this. So must our minds. #ObamaFarewell
"Race remains a potent &amp; often divisive force in our society... All of us have work to do." Amen. Yes we do. #ObamaFarewell
On supporting a better healthcare: "That's why we serve... to make people's lives better." #ObamaFarewell
"We rise or fall as one." So important at this moment in our country to remember that. #ObamaFarewell
"...only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people." Yes, let's focus on our common purpose #ObamaFarewell
"It's up to all of us to make sure our gov meets the many challenges we still face," ensuring a peaceful transfer of power #ObamaFarewell
"You were the change." I love that. Yes, we were. Yes, we are. #ObamaFarewell
"The long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion... To embrace all and not just some." #ObamaFarewell
"From Selma to Stonewall..." People were prepared to give their lives. Makes me think, where is that today? #ObamaFarewell
We the people, can form a more perfect union. A radical idea that still stands. #ObamaFarewell
Change only happens when ordinary people get involved. So true. #ObamaFarewell
Appreciation to the entire Obama family and the Bidens for their service. All great role models.

37% of Republicans approve of Putin. Sobering.
The hacking story is not a partisan issue, it's a patriotic issue. All of us should think about our roles in this.
Obama's comments today should make the press, citizens and political folks think about what we give weight to in our national discourse.
Watching Obama's press conference comments re: email hacking &amp; how it was covered by press. Worth all of us reflecting on, on our part.

As today comes to a close, here's what I've Been Thinking... https://t.co/hAvdkUSplc
I have been in a losing campaign. It's gut wrenching. Heartbreaking. To everyone on social &amp; in media, please be kind.
May we hold Mrs Clinton in our prayers and our hearts. She stepped into the arena. She tried. She did her best. Hold her in your heart.
I count my blessing every day &amp; believe the best days ahead. Whoever breaks the glass ceiling will owe their gratitude to Mrs Clinton.
"To women who put their faith in me. Proud to be your champion. Someone will break that glass ceiling." Thank you for trying Mrs Clinton.
Mrs Clinton acknowledges the hurt, the loss. Says it was still worth it. Wow!
Mrs Clinton to young people: I've had success and setbacks. Sometimes really painful ones. This loss hurts.
Mrs Clinton is courageous. Regardless of who you voted for, please see this: a woman who tried, did her best, who had grit and determination
I am so grateful to stand with all of you - Mrs Clinton thanking the Obamas for their graceful leadership &amp; thanking her family
I still believe in America. Donald Trump is our president. We owe him an open mind.
Mrs Clinton looking beautiful, sounding smart &amp; wise. I know how disappointed u feel. I feel it too. This is painful &amp; will be 4 a long time
Mrs Clinton "This is not outcome we worked so hard for. I feel pride and gratitude." You should
Mrs Clinton loves this country says Tim Kaine. That we know for sure. Devoted her life to it.
As we await Mrs Clintons speech may we find compassion within &amp; extend it to her. Shes a human being. Imagine yourself in her shoes. Be kind
This is a divided country, we all have to take a deep breath.
On this day, may we all remember we are instruments of peace. Mrs Clinton won the popular vote, Trump electoral. Let's all be humble.
Can't imagine how tough it was for Mrs Clinton to concede to Trump. My heart goes out to her.
Trump says this was a movement of people who want a better life for their families &amp; will renew American dream Lets hope and pray he can do
My fellow Americans, tomorrow we must put this election behind us &amp; reach across the divide. We have to listen, learn &amp; find a way to unite.
This election is much closer than anyone anticipated. West coast: you can still vote! Get out there! This is close!

Let's be clear about debate. Headline will be Trump saying he won't necessarily accept results. That's what will be left in people's minds.
Thanks to both for agreeing to these debates. The decision is now up to all of us. #debatenight #vote
Trump final statement: He needs to reach out to independents. I will do more for African American and Latinos than she will. A positive end?
Clinton: Reaching out to all Americans. We need your talents, energy &amp; skills. I understand awesome responsibility. Great final statement.
"Would like to end this on a positive note." Amen. #debatenight
Sec Clinton: Bernie Sanders says I think you are the most dangerous person to run for president. I agree. #debatenight
It's free fair election &amp; all must accept results. Clinton - I'm appalled at position Trump taking. America is bigger than any party. Cmon!
At the end of campaign loser concedes to winner &amp; accept results.Trump says he'll keep us in suspense. This is not a game this is not funny.
I'll look at the results of the election when it's over. Trump will not commit to results. Here we go folks... #debatenight
It's time for us to each decide where we want to take our country. America is great already because it's is good. #debatenight
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. There is not a woman on this earth who doesn't know what that feels like. #debatenight
Why would so many women make up these stories? "I think her campaign did it," ...lies and fiction he says. #debatenight
Swirling in my head: 30 yrs experience. 4 mins for the nuclear button. Crocodile tears. 33,000 die from gunshots each year. #debatenight
Crocodile tears. Uh oh! Trump Hotel in Vegas was built with Chinese steel. Yikes! #debatenight
4 minutes. 4 minutes and nuclear weapons go. That sticks in my mind. Calm decision making. #debatenight
4 mins btwn when president says go &amp; nuclear weapons go. Terrifying responsibility. Think about whose finger you want on that button.
Mrs Clinton: Most important point in this election, that trump reject Putin. Putin now getting a lot of air time. #debatenight
He choked... She just said Donald choked with the Mexican president. He will not like that description! #debatenight
The wall is back! He never explains how to build that wall!! And did he just say "hombres"??? #debatenight
We have come too far to have these personal, intimate choices reversed. #debatenight
Very stark differences on Roe v Wave btwn candidates. Women's health choices now front and center. #debatenight
33,000 people die every year from guns. That figure should make us all stop and think. #debatenight
Sec Clinton: Important that we don't reverse Roe v Wade, marriage equality. Important to remember vote 4 prez impacts the court #debatenight
Before tonight's final debate, I'm sharing my Debate Party Rules. What are yours? #debatenight https://t.co/nrzIV1E0vg

Best question at end. Mrs Clinton says "I respect his children." Mr Trump says "Shes a fighter she, doesnt give up &amp; fights hard." #debate
What will you remember from this #debate?
Leaders need discipline. They need to be calm, cooperative &amp; collaborative. They need to be a uniter, not a divider. #debate
Ten minutes to go. I'm worry that this divided nation will be even more so at end of this. #debate
The Trump Effect. Bullying is up. Pay attention. #debate
"I have a deep devotion" - Sec Clinton. You need a deep devotion to ensure this. #debate
"He and I haven't spoken." Trump about Pence. #debate
This man is so demeaning, the energy is coming thru the TV. So condescending. #debate
Talk about thirty years of accomplishments. Talk it up, girl! You've got them, speak truth. #debate
I'm stress eating. This man doesn't stop. #debate
Trump standing behind Mrs. Clintons in her space creeps me out. #debate
Mr Trump: "I know nothing about Russian" ...LOL! #debate
We have never seen an outside country try this hard to influence an election. Terrifying. #debate
Leaders need to be collaborative and mindful of their language and tone. Whose tone &amp; language do you want representing you? #debate
This is a fact. Trump makes stuff up. Gotta remember that. #debate https://t.co/jfKFbSJ7HI
This is a bully. This is rudeness on display. I hope if our kids see this they know this is what a bully looks like. Teaching moment #debate
I've got to say, I doubt I could hold my temper with this. Let's fact check, fact check, fact check. #debate
What the devil? "If I win I'm going to instruct my attorney general to look into you." What is happening to our politics? #debate
Sec Clinton staying high. Everyone should draw their own conclusions on whether this man respects women. We can make our own conclusions.
It is beyond belief that our politics have come to this. #debate
We see him go after women. This is who Donald Trump is. We must question our country &amp; answer. This is not who we are. #debate
Here we go... We heard him talking about what he thinks about women. I think it represents exactly who he is.
I can't believe what I'm hearing. "No I've never done those things." What's happening?? #debate
Thank you @andersoncooper for the follow up. Trump doesn't get it. He doesn't understand. #debate
We must make clear to our children that we ARE good. Mrs. Clinton is calm, clear, and confident. No easy feat tonight. #debate
Omg my friend Suzanne brought these. This is what we're starting with! #debate https://t.co/U4cpLs1q50
Stay on the high road. Stay calm. Stay classy. #debate
Again, there are no words. How low can this man go? https://t.co/OAHdH20X3c

Important read from my brother @Mark_Shriver on putting our children first https://t.co/75x6Z4zWtE
There are just no words... https://t.co/2I0myR474k
Good statement from Mike Pence. Remarks are indefensible. https://t.co/YrHfydSnNW
The best way to truly condemn this language is to vote against it. It's the only "you're fired" that some seem to understand.
I'm really heartened by all the good people in the world condemning this language that is so offensive to women and men alike.

We are done. Measured conversation -- very good. Thank you both @timkaine &amp; @GovPenceIN for your service. #VPDebate
Unity is coming together, working across the aisle. It's crucial. Kaine and Clinton do have track record of working across the aisle.
How do you unify the country? A question for all of us. How do you want to see the candidates do this? #VPDebate
"Why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves? - Sen Kaine #VPDebate
Love that Sen Kaine said let's talk about this. Last thing govt should do is punish women who make choices about their reproductive rights.
"We trust American women to make their own decisions with their bodies." - Sen Kaine #VPDebate
Love Tim Kaines depiction of struggle regarding death penalty. #VPDebate
Clinton Foundation DOES do good work. That's a fact. #VPDebate
I think most Americans interested in jobs, economy, taxes, racial divide, health care &amp; immigration. Let's get back to that. #VPDebate
Can we get off the Putin topic already? #VPDebate
Is this swaying any voters? Does this impact your vote one way or another? #VPDebate
Good comeback from Sen Kaine re: Pence court martial. Smart, solid response. #VPDebate
Hope they talk plans to help millions caregivers &amp; funding most expensive disease in our history - #Alzheimers. Real relief for real people.
Personal Mt Rushmore? Oh my. I love our Mt Rushmore as is! #VPDebate
Terrorist threats decreased according to Sen Kaine. I don't think most people agree. #VPDebate
"I look forward to working together in whatever capacity we serve in." -- Sen Tim Kaine. No matter who wins we must work together #VPDebate
Thoughtful, compassionate &amp; steady -- Pence's words to describe Trump. How would you describe him?? #VPDebate
Gov Pence has a big job to do tonight -- steady a ticket &amp; steady people's nerves. #VPDebate
Gracious opening by Gov Pence #VPDebate
There's a saying that behind every successful woman is herself. Tim Kaine disproves that this time -- a good man behind a successful woman.
Fascinating and wonderful to watch a man talk about being proud to support a strong woman. #VPDebate
Qualities, skills, temperament -- good question for all of us to ask to those in our own lives. #VPDebate

Great evening, honored to watch. A critical election. Vote AMERICA -- bc that's what makes America great, that we can vote #debatenight
Great stamina response from Sec Clinton #DebateNight
She's showing stamina in this debate. She looks damn presidential to me. Smart. Calm. Classy. #debatenight
Love that everyone is focused, attentive &amp; respectful of what this night is showing us #debatenight https://t.co/D59EYCf6cs
Words matter. It's essential that America's word be good. Amen to that. #debatenight
I wasn't expecting a knockout but it's what I'm watching. Knockout on facts. Knockout on temperament. Knockout on going high. #debatenight
No going low. Stay high on the high road, stay high! #debatenight
Wicked smart. Wicked calm. Wicked strong. Wicked wise. Guess who I'm referring to? #debatenight
Yes! You should've! Open invite, lots of comfort food. Next debate, come! https://t.co/VwpTO9ui8r
Whatever you want to say, you've gotta admit Mrs Clinton is what I call wicked smart! #debatenight
One of these two people will be our next president. Make your vote count. Think about that as we watch. #debatenight
Yes, Obama is a man of great dignity. Sec Clinton not going low, going and staying on high road. #debatenight
The racist birther lie... Trump can't close the deal on that question. His answer doesn't jive. Think about that. #debatenight
Great follow up by @LesterHoltNBC -- no response from Trump as to why it took him so long. #debatenight
Stayed home? So snide. #debatenight
Implicit bias -- smart for Sec Clinton to focus it onto all of us #debatenight
Omg. If looks could kill... Arguing with the moderator. Mrs Clinton, class act not interrupting.
Wow to response on taxes from Sec Clinton #debatenight
Silence in the room. Historic night. #debatenight https://t.co/nOw0ri38kK

God bless Mother Teresa. She mothered, and in doing so, changed not just her life but the lives of millions. A saint among us. Bravo!
There are places all over the world where each of us can be of service. We just have to open our eyes, our minds and our hearts.
Mother Teresa was indeed a woman of great service and faith but also struggled with that faith making her more human and fascinating to me.
My mother once told me Mother Teresa would become a saint. I thought she was dreaming. But Sunday, she will be canonized.
This picture sits in my childhood bedroom. My mother idolized Mother Teresa &amp; was inspired by her faith and service. https://t.co/zgzFJA2FRt

But not before making sure I knew how to skipper my own boat. Be the skipper of your own life.
She sailed rough seas with courage, determination &amp; a fierce resolve. Hair blowing eyes straight ahead. She left a hole the size of an ocean
My mother was the skipper of her life and the lives of so many others.
If you don't, do what I do: Find a quiet spot and talk to her. Today I'll be in a space and place that my mother loved, Cape Cod. By the sea
7 years feels like an eternity &amp; then it feels like yesterday. If you are lucky enough to have your mom, call her, hug her, reach out to her
