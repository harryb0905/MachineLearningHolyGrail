Can you believe that this album was released 20 years ago today?! I can’t. It’s been the journey of a lifetime, but I’m grateful for every moment. Getting to know you all over the years has been such an incredible experience. Thank you for all your support ❤️ #BabyOneMoreTime20 https://t.co/vbj10cDn2C
I appreciate your prayers and support for my family during this time. Thank you, and love you all… always.
I had to make the difficult decision to put my full focus and energy on my family at this time. I hope you all can understand. More information on ticket refunds is available on https://t.co/SBF4WxXT31.
However, it’s important to always put your family first… and that’s the decision I had to make. A couple of months ago, my father was hospitalized and almost died. We’re all so grateful that he came out of it alive, but he still has a long road ahead of him.
I don’t even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say. I will not be performing my new show Domination. I’ve been looking forward to this show and seeing all of you this year, so doing this breaks my heart. https://t.co/kHgFAVTjNA

.@iTunesMusic @ReadySetRock75 Alien #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic You get to be Britney Bitch ;) #AskBritney
Especially because it's a greatest hits show. I just hope Vegas is ready! ;) #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic SO excited!! I'm counting down the days to December 27th! I REALLY think this is going to be my best show ever... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Loving @lordemusic right now, such a unique talent. @MileyCyrus of course. I think she made an amazing album. #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Work Bitch is shaping up to be an incredible number in my Vegas residency. I think my fans are going to LOVE it. #AskBritney
I dont think anyone ever thought they would see a @Tip feature on one of my albums :) #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic The features may be surprising, but I'm really excited to have my sister @jamielynnspears &amp; @Tip on the record... #AskBritney
I tend to write from experience, but also enjoy fantasizing &amp; writing from imagination. #AskBritney
I used this album to get out everything I'd bottled up over the last few years... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic On this album I mostly drew from personal experience. #BritneyJean was therapeutic... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic Of course! I've recorded a few songs in the past specifically about my boys and they are my daily inspiration. :) #AskBritney
It also has a lot of personal songs. Songs that are very moody and vibe driven. #AskBritney
I typically make albums that are fun pop/dance records &amp; #BritneyJean has a few, but... #AskBritney
.@iTunesMusic #BritneyJean is very special to me! It's a diff album than any other album I've recorded throughout my career... #AskBritney
Q&amp;A with @iTunesMusic in an hour!
Day off... been a busy week but damn I'm going stir crazy, what's a girl to do without her dancers?!
#FlashbackFriday A #BritneyJean moment from way too long ago. My goodness time flies! http://t.co/IC97MPWcCM
Nelson Mandela was a true inspiration to all humanity. He will truly be missed.
"Perfume" video, next week on @VEVO http://t.co/lE4eymp3Zd
It warms my heart that y'all are loving #BritneyJean. Get your copy @amazonmp3 &lt;3 http://t.co/LtJvU2BiVv
Lots of love to everyone who has already gotten their copy of #BritneyJean :) MUAH! Xo http://t.co/dps446FIFx
That's it!! Thx so much for listening through the album w/ me :) I love reading what u guys think of the songs! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@ItsROfficial Your background is hilarious
Which version of #Perfume do you guys like the best? I'm not sure I could choose!! I really love both :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@califever That sounds like fun! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@SamerMajali It does have that feel a little doesn't it? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Next Up: #NowThatIFoundYou! This song just sounds like love doesn't it? :) LOVE the music on this track! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I think it helped set the direction for the album overall. RT @loosho @britneyspears what makes it different? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@InsaneMia All of the Britney Army are my Brightest Morning Stars #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@KurtiusMaximus OMG too funny #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@CoolBeans_XD Love that :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
It’s the 1st song I recorded for #BritneyJean. My dear friend @KooolKojak came over to my house w/ his guitar &amp; we wrote this song together.
@TiffanyZeyer Cute! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
#HoldOnTight is a little different from the rest of the record, but I loved writing and recording this one!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Brightest Morning Star is a song @Sia helped me write about God :) Who is ur Brightest Morning Star? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@dangerbritney That's what I hoped for! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@BuzzFeed Chillin' with you ;)
@WesleyWalrus Well thank you. Don't cry though! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
He suggested getting Foster The People 2 help on production. I really think they nailed it. They added a few bells &amp; the whistle on the song
When @iamwill &amp; I were finishing the song we felt it was missing something. It felt like it needed something to make the song more unique...
Funny story about that! RT @EmreAkn I love the whistle in the beginning. It gives me chills. And the lyrics are soo emotional :(
@neevebayb Means the world sweetie, thank you! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
This one was very therapeutic for me. Sometimes a girl needs to remind herself not to cry and that life will go on.
Really proud of the final version of #DontCry :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@GrantPYoung @jamielynnspears I have too! It finally felt right for this album. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@jamielynnspears Your voice really shines on #ChillinWithYou sis!! Proud of u &lt;3
@Robin_H00d Good luck!! Thanks for tweeting along :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
She's more of a country artist and I'm obviously pop so we figured we would meet in the middle :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@hausofbliss Wait until you hear more of her music!
@brunolovesbrit @jamielynnspears That would be fun wouldn't it?? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
She's been working on her first album in Nashville for a while and I thought it would be really cool to have her on my album.
@AllexxSpears Enjoy the ride :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
.@jamielynnspears and I had SO much fun recording #ChillinWithYou!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I just loved this song and it spoke to me right away. RT @hausofbader The beat and lyrics are everything! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@zacharyfunk Aw thankya Zachary. Loved loved loved recording this one. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@leogmz @katyperry Yes she is! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
My girl @KatyPerry wrote this one with @Sia and the @Diplo track is incredible :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I fell in love with #Passenger as soon as I heard it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@breatheheavycom Hehe!
Life is funny like that. Think I've kicked myself a few times after breaking up w someone. Dont kno why it’s always so clear AFTER u breakup
This makes me smile! RT @alekjandro it's makes me stronger, It's helping me@cope with a broken heart &lt;/3 #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@Manon_ASP Yes ma'am #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@ElenitaSPEARS Too sweet, thank you sweetie xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty
#TilItsGone is a post-break up song, and it's true... You never really know what you have until it's gone. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@picsoftumblr I see you now! O_O #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@leoinsiders2 A God job, wow! Ha #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@MRKiNGALEXXX You'll have to wait &amp; see ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
The show I'm putting together has more dance than any show I've ever done. I guess I was dancing until my body ached every single day. LOL!!
When I cut this song I was right in the middle of dance rehearsals for my Vegas show...
@freeasmydick So cool! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
I think at my core, I am a dancer through and through. ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
And the next song is #BodyAche! I think this song speaks to my biggest passion which has always been dancing.
@teambritneyuk_ Omgoodness, me too. Tik Tik Tik  #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@daniel_tang @Tip It's a good one! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Seeing lots of these tweets! Hmmm.... RT @_DenverSean make #TikTikBoom a single. #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@famousrichard What show are you coming to?? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Next up: #TikTikBoom!! I knew immediately that I had to have @Tip on this track! You guys dig it? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Always fun in the studio w @iamwill RT @GGsaid this song is so fun, you must have had a great time making it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@dafuqboys Luv u too! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Sometimes, we make love really complicated, but I've always felt It Should Be Easy :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
So much love to @sia for helping create such an amazing song!! Xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Sooner than you think! RT @britneyspeans My favorite! when are we getting the video? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@TiffanyCarterxo Lips are sealed :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Can you guess who this song is about?
#Perfume is really just about relationship insecurities &amp; feeling insecure about the person you care for the most #BritneyJeanListeningParty
You better believe it! RT @dangerbritney Are u going to perform Work Bitch in Vegas? #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@TWY69 Hehe, nope don't have 1 of those either #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@CassPiamyheroes Get it girl! #BritneyJeanListeningParty

@chr14t12n One of mine too #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Such a massive fan. I def see myself working w him more in the future RT @StephanyValeIz #BritneyJeanListeningParty How was working w Orbit?
Sometimes I need to remind myself that i'm #NotAlone :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty
Song deals with loneliness and how you can be surrounded at all times by friends, family and adoring fans who you love and still feel alone.
Starting with Alien :) Loved working on this track with the very talented @WilliamOrbit! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
