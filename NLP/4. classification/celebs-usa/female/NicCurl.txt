So excited for our trip to @Korbel1882 in June! Flights are booked :)
@NNicholson10 @db10er Hust saw Aaron Rodgers in the crowd. Go Bucky!
That might have been the most bumpy and scary flight I have ever been on. @kpatts and I are needing to stand on solid ground. 1 more flight!
Funny how a couple days of traveling for business can really tire you out. Let's hope travel goes smooth this evening!
It is funny how I cannot sleep well when I travel for business. It is so weird! Been up for 30 minutes and do not need to get up for 60.
@APottinger @NNicholson10 @Sachcurl me too?!?!?
“@MelissaJoanHart: Pick 2 http://t.co/8NVGmONVDC” Very accurate!!
It is quite unfortunate that Emma decided today of all days she would not take a nap. #stillnotfeelingwell #needrest
Still fighting a nasty head cold. I was hoping today I would feel better!
Best part of my busy day was getting home to see Emma before she went to bed :) #readbooks #snuggle
A little retail therapy while Emma takes a nap! Left and returned to her still snoozing while @db10er watches bball. Nice!
Mommy and Emma! Happy Saturday :) https://t.co/L71QyzP3U3

I am obsessed with watching Shark Tank. #SharkTankNation

Enjoying a night out supporting the Latino Chamber of Commerce. Happy to be at the @tdstelecom table. #ourfuture
I give up! My eyes just won't stay open any longer. What a week! I am mentally and physically drained. Night world :)
12Days of Christmas workout @PatPatsgym put me through yesterday, destroyed me. Simple things like typing have become a painful. #paincave
Is it too early to go to bed?
We have been in our house 3 years and hanging up pictures I bought a year ago. #betterlatethannever
Let's go Bucky!!
I am going to avoid stairs and walking in general tomorrow. My legs are dead from 100 heavy squats! Thanks @PatPatsgym :)
@mollylarson70 @GoogleFacts True! Except not as much at the elite level play like Nationals and World Championships. But certainly the tour!
All smiles as we awaited our ride on the Polar Express! http://t.co/WpiRxiGpur
I'm 1 present away from being done w/ all our Christmas shopping for our families. Thank you Internet...couldn't have done it without you :)

I made it through the October Challenge @patsgym! 31 x 1 min max cals on the Airdyne. No more Airdyne @PatPatsgym!! #allout #alldone
Studying this week for my 9th and final CCP Exam on Monday. Yahoo!!!! #workinghard #gettingsmarter
Getting the award for most creative packing to avoid checking my bag :) #boughttoomuch #personalstylist

Time for some shopping, food and laughs with @NNicholson10 and @APottinger :) #funtimes #toastlife
Some light reading for the plane. #gettingsmarter http://t.co/iqyj59oy0B
In need of an Airdyne in Verona :( Right, @PatPatsgym?
@NNicholson10 The second best thing we do is #shop ... Which we get to do next weekend with @APottinger :)
Out for a walk and I captured this cute picture of db10er and our little peanut :) http://t.co/I6XntsgOU7

"Adaptability is about the powerful difference between adapting to cope and adapting to win." - Max McKeown
Workout = Suffering w/ @PatPatsgym ... Although not doing the same workout, there were others suffering in the pain cave #miserylovescompany
Dear Flatiron: Today was not the day to die on me. Your replacement cost is substantial...You are eating into my fun money. Regards, Nic
@patsgym October challenge is not a single event but 31 x 1 min max cals on the #airdyne. @PatPatsgym had me do 4 to stay on track...#ouch
@NNicholson10 I wish I was there too! Miss you :) Get a little sun (with appropriate levels of sunscreen) for me!

Out to dinner with my two favorite people! http://t.co/q3AliwRNnR
Thanks @PatPatsgym 4 killing me in the gym this week. I would give U a high 5 but my arms cannot move above shoulder height, nor straighten.
I can only hope that I run into no one I know on my brief errand trip… I look hideous!
I can finally see the bottom of my inbox at work. Time to call it a day/night! Happy weekend!
Twins! Happy Monday :) http://t.co/1DrtOUUp33
Work Trip=Pool Car. The one I reserved has our @tdstelecom logo on it. Wore my "TDS Blue" which warrants a picture :) http://t.co/YjF58nVpP3
Nothing better than FaceTime with Emma in the morning when I am traveling for work. We "chatted" and she gave me FaceTime kisses :) @db10er
@tc110 It is healing pretty good! I still cannot bend my first knuckle but hoping I can next week!
Just killed a nasty bug in my hotel room. I am sure I will sleep real well tonight. #ihatebugs #ihatespiders
When U can't use your hands in a workout....U end up doing 300 lunges &amp; 150 GHD situps. Did I also mention the 5 min wall sit? @PatPatsgym
@flipwrite 6 stitches and some pain. I will survive!
@fajita43 Yes, for sure. Or just blizzards from now on!
@AJPreziosi Left hand - middle finger has 6 stitches!
Learned an important lesson. Ice cream cakes need to thaw before cutting. Otherwise you end up in the ER getting your finger stitched. #ouch
Nothing like having a great steak dinner cooked to perfection by @db10er with a $35 bottle of Merlot :) #happywifehappylife
Mowed our lawn @db10er :) #wifeoftheyear #pushmower
Enjoying a VIP "behind the finish line" Ironman experience with @db10er. #amazingathletes #ironman

Looking forward to a much needed 90 minute massage today. #soremuscles #recovery #metime
Walked into my workout today...still super sore from Tuesday. It was a challenge but happy I survived :)
Looking forward to participating in the Superhero Run/Walk on Saturday with @db10er and Emma!
Checking out our new TDS TV lineup. She loves the Disney channel :) http://t.co/L3C51VmIPL
August Challenge at @patsgym is 100 box jumps for time. 20" box for females. I completed it in 3min42sec which resulted in major quad pain:)
Proud of myself for making PR on my dead lift today with @PatPatsgym. Almost got 240lbs but was excited to get 235lbs :)
@USPS you have failed me. Priority Mail to IL ends up in CA? Really?!?!
It is sad when a trip to Target...by myself...turns into something I look forward to on the rare occasion. LOL
Wishing I had food in the house. Guess it is a bowl of cereal kind of night :(
@VeronaCavaliers Dramatic much?? @db10er
I need to find a way to recharge...in all aspects of my life! #findaway #stayinthemoment
What a day! Work, workout, Emma Time, study, more work. Time for bed and more of the same tomorrow :) #goodnight
Here's a picture of half of the landscaping project we took on this week at our house. Cannot wait til it all blooms! http://t.co/smqrJ9JKSD
2.5 tons of rock to move tomorrow. Excited to have all the plants in the ground &amp; weed-block in place. Not excited to shovel &amp; move rock...
@CharlieFPotts @db10er Just taking a year off to decide what I want to do :)
@Sharks4Cup @db10er Just taking a year off to decide what I want to do :)
@atomicaunt711 Luckily no, just a in the middle of a major landscaping project at home!
10 of 21 plants are planted :) Why do I always get these crazy landscaping ideas...so much work. Family is helping!
Just got drug tested by USADA for the second time in a month. Interesting because as of July 25 I had been removed! #pee #drugfree
Between working out and the big landscaping project at our house… I am wrecked!
Today was a battle in the gym...but in the end I won. Thanks @PatPatsgym for pushing me through another grueling workout :)
I could not have asked for a more productive weekend. #feelingsuperhappy #cleanhouse #familytime #studyingcomplete
@VeronaCavaliers @db10er If that is true, that is REALLY weak.
Cannot sleep...guessing the evening latte to help me study is now going to keep me up. #justmyluck #spidersolitairetime
Feeling more myself after a good workout today. I think I forgot about all the craziness in my life for a solid hour. Thanks @PatPatsgym
@CharlieFPotts @patsgym LOL - I work in HR and specifically in compensation. So I help shape pay plans/policy and day to day activities.
@CharlieFPotts Certified Compensation Professional (CCP) for work. 10 exams on different topics. #intense
Eating alone at a restaurant didn't feel weird until just now...check please ;) #desserttogo
My brain hurts just as much as my core :( Time to eat and then more work/study time.
In Chicago, getting smarter :) It was so nice out this morning that I wish we could hold the class outside! Going to get hot quick! #ac
Today is worse than Friday post #core workout with @PatPatsgym on Thursday.  I cannot stand up straight...
Nervous...but I think that just means you are about to do something that matters and is meaningful :) #embraceit #noregrets
@GumballRalley I don't watch his show...magazine :)
@AJPreziosi @TRXtraining I have used TRX and like it!
"Winners do things losers don't want to." - Dr. Phil #iliketowin

This has been db10er for the last hour... http://t.co/B5sSc60FfV
Reconfirmed my "wife of the year" status once again @db10er...you owe me ;)
Emma = Nap. @db10er = Nap. Mama = Studying. Quiet house :)
@tc110 Getting a second opinion for sure!
@tc110 Yes, but it is a killer!
@AJPreziosi Yes, agree :(
@RickSwansonNY Thanks!
@tc110 Love the slosh pipe!!
@AnneFHughes Weird, huh? Response is before too!
@RickSwansonNY 2nd opinion for sure!
@tc110 No. That is why I found it odd:(
@kde52 oh great! I do not want fall apart :)
@tc110 I find it odd that is how she responded :)
I have had a headache for about two weeks...left temple. I messaged my doctor and she told me "old people get headaches"...what? Is 33 old?
@DangerousMabry Taking a year off to re-group :)
@atomicaunt711 I should have :) What an odd spot to be in...oh hey coworkers...these are my drug testers ;)
@GumballRalley No but try explaining to all your coworkers why two people are following you in the bathroom to get a pee sample!!
Random Athlete Drug Testing...today...at my work! Really USADA? You couldn't hit me up at home? #notevencurlingthisyear #complicated
Feels weird to be spending my night studying. #gettingsmarter #work
Happy birthday @db10er :)
120k Delta Sky Miles later and we are booked for Christmas in Baton Rouge! #warmweather #cousins

@db10er @APottinger @Sachcurl @dougpottinger Not surprising :) #curling
@bphebus Someone just beat me by 10 seconds :(
I don't feel like I'm "winning" at anything this week...
@AnneFHughes @PatPatsgym You killed it as well :)
June Challenge...50 Burpees for time. Killed it in 2 min 15 sec :) Thanks for coaching me through it @PatPatsgym
It is time to battle... #noregrets
Snuggles in the basement...love my little peanut to pieces! http://t.co/T6DcwnMrNd
@db10er Status update please?
Working hard :) http://t.co/U0HxYfk4CX
@Klspencer22 Hopefully the storms stay away for the rest of the weekend :)
@CharlieFPotts No contemplation needed for that decision :)
Often times, the most difficult decisions can also be the most freeing. I hope that holds true.
More storms tonight. Hopefully these do not lead to tornados :(
@FrankF1951 You never know until you walk in :)
I powered through a workout @patsgym today...even though I was going on very little sleep. Another challenge awaits tomorrow morning!
I wish understood my shrubs, plants and trees better. Some do great with little care and some struggle each year. #stumped #notagreenthumb
@GumballRalley Typically Sept - April.
Wishing the show Yard Crashers would crash our yard! #yardcrashers #diynetwork
Muscles hurt from my Thursday workout with @patsgym...not sure what part is 2 blame but the cool down of 100 KB swings in a row might be it!
Will I change my mind in 30 min? Probably :)
I should be cleaning the floor or doing some other productive chore but I am not. Do I feel lazy? Yes. Do I feel feel bad about it? No.
Good to be back in the gym with @patsgym! 40-30-20-10 sets of OH Squat and Ring Push-Ups w/ feet elevated. #noregrets
@recoby4of5 Reeled it in a couple hundred feet :)
In the air on our way to see our little Emma. Missed her so much but she had some special time with Grandma and PaPa.

Today was a grind in the gym. 25 - 20# slams + 25 - 40# KB swings in 2.5 min (any extra time is "rest") x 11 sets. 275 reps for each!
@CharlieFPotts I definitely have one and totally agree :)
Heavy weight lunges today with @patsgym ... Wonder how my glutes will feel tomorrow...
A little behind in my magazine reading...hello @OxygenMagazine December 2013...and January 2014...and February 2014 :)

Unexpected post-work evening with our neighbor buds. So fun watching the girls play while we hang out!
Exhausted...brain was on overdrive @ work. I just told @db10er I might go to bed &amp; realized it was 7:37pm! Maybe I should wait for sunset...
Hello Monday...you arrived all to soon. #icedlatte
Wearing a pedometer to see how many steps I take...Emma's constant desire to go on a walk and go to the park have netted me 10K+ already!

We are making the most of our delay in Toronto. I have been working on a lot of projects for work and soon we plan to hit the gym.
Our flight was cancelled to Saint John &amp; the next available on any carrier is tomorrow. Times like this I wish I knew a pilot with a plane!

Watching the Oscars! Great way to spend the evening as we brace for the snow storm 2014. #wearenotinwisconsin
3-0! P is for Patience! :) Capped off a great day by putting my little lady to bed!
Got a solid win this morning! It was fun to have Emma watch this morning. She was cheering hard for us :)
First WIN in the books. On tomorrow at 8am. Time for dinner!
Getting ready for our official practice at the @2014CurlingNats ... looking forward to getting this show on the road :)
Great travel day with my little Emma. We are tuckered out but safely in Philly. She was a good travel partner :)
@Erik_in_Raleigh Minutes! Part of why we have done so well over the years.
@Erik_in_Raleigh No. Just a single practice! We will get on the ice together in Friday :)
Solid practice at the curling club this afternoon. Feeling great! Looking forward to competing in Philly starting on Saturday. #noregrets
@jade_moshier 15 years old :)
Decided 2 trim Emma's bangs tonight...she was squirmy...@db10er was trying 2 distract her...def not straight &amp; def too short. #epicfail
I was on my way to the curling club when I got an email that there is ice maintenance this morning unexpectedly...#bummer
Weekly Target run complete...@db10er let Emma run wild while I shopped and she is now taking a really good nap :)
@db10er Nope...Bluetooth and Voice tweet...#boom
Turkish get-up with 55lb KB...working on the February challenge with @patsgym!
@Erik_in_Raleigh Potentially but I wouldn't pay money to play in an event that 1 loss means you are done.
@Erik_in_Raleigh Triple knockout with qualifiers is ideal.
PR on hex-bar dead lift today! 240lbs...boom. Thanks for coaching me through it @patsgym!
@CharlieFPotts Total ergo mouse! And beer was needed for this endevor!
@LeePrice273 I think it will be interesting to see what they do. I am not sure what the answer is :(
@marksme That is interesting!
Old school PC pulled out of storage to dump files on an external hard drive so the PC can be donated :) http://t.co/wvE0neNbv2
@ChuckS65 Thanks for the tweet :)
Happy Valentine's Day everyone! :)
Morning workout with @patsgym ... Working off those Valentine chocolate  treats :)
@RyanAntony22 @DavidBurgenske @db10er Can you also teach him to put the phone away at dinner? Please and Thank You :)
@DavidBurgenske @db10er @RyanAntony22 Better you then me....drives me batty :)
@Erik_in_Raleigh I appreciate it and totally knew what you meant :)
@Erik_in_Raleigh It would be a lot to commit another 4 years. The time I spend on and off the ice training is a lot. It is a balance w/life.
Today my workout was a test of mental toughness...I survived &amp; am better for it both physically &amp; mentally. Thanks @patsgym! #noregrets
@TXscuba26 anything to help curling exposure but I would be more in favor of a mixed event vs. mixed doubles.
@WestBend7Up @VeronaCavaliers LOL - not in charge of that. Haha
“@LeahV93: @NicCurl do you see yourself making a run for 2018? #missyououtthere #curlinghero” Thanks...haven't decided :)
@Erik_in_Raleigh Sorry, I see the orig ? non-hammer. That is a stealing strategy in most cases or 2 bring the play 2 the middle vs corners.
@Erik_in_Raleigh Rocks in the rings can always B hit so it would likely never net U more than one point if you always put them in the rings.
@Erik_in_Raleigh There is a lot of strategy behind guard placement. First four stones if in front of house, cannot be removed. (Cont)
@Erik_in_Raleigh sure, what's on your mind?
@zestyZacRipple Yes, for many reasons....wish I was playing but that is the competitor in me!
“@mdillon98: @NicCurl is it too late for Team USA to fly you out to the Olympics?!!!” I wish!!! LOL
@GoodGovt I wear short sleeves when I play in an arena due to the ambient temp...you work up a sweat sweeping ;)
@stevejohnsonokc They beat us at the Trials. Just wish the outcome would have been different. We all train so hard!
@tjszuch That made me laugh :-)
@TopherDaTiger We lost the Olympic Trials final in November :(
@Erik_in_Raleigh No worries!  :)  We have the US Nationals in March and will hopefully get back to the World Championship :)
@tjszuch We lost the Olympic Final in November :( Sad!!
@Erik_in_Raleigh I do not...still too painful that I am not there :(
@c_spears10 I think I saw that the other day too!
@Larry_Jensen After 2010 we parted ways...it was time to try something new in line up.
@TurnerWalston Each athlete throws 2 rocks an end. The Skip calls the shots and the others sweep when they are not throwing
@Larry_Jensen We lot the Olympic Trial final in November :(
#nike calf sleeve...so much cooler than an ordinary compression sock! #nikerocks #lookgoodplaygood http://t.co/eAsbQ7RMXo
Great to medal at the Olympics but I totally gets this!! True Champ!  “@HK_Ski: Bronze feels at lot like a broken heart.”
Snow, snow and more snow :) At least they are big fluffy flakes! Coffee and #HGTV while Emma naps.
@WesleyWilson We are selling the condo in Madison. Crossing my fingers!
2 showings at our condo today. Praying we get an offer soon! #twomortgages #bleedingmoney
@JHall886 I am usually not in that area to curl. But if I ever am, I will tweet back!
@JHall886 It's a bummer but luckily I have had opportunities in the past that many only dream of. That is the positive :)
@JHall886 Our team lost the Olympic Trial Final game :(
In 3 weeks, Emma will head to the @2014CurlingNats w/ me. This will be her 2nd time to Philly. 1st time I was prego and no one knew :)
@d_e_heller Good curling :)
Good work @db10er on the 2k! @patsgym will be able to give us workouts to feel the burn using our @concept2 :)
200 bench press with bamboo bar &amp; kettle bells hanging from the bar on bands...every muscle in my upper body is feeling it! Thanks @patsgym!
@GretaPete I had a melanoma in situ re-excised on my calf. Luckily, it was found 2 B on the surface but have 2 take margins - 3 in scar!
@zestyZacRipple Awwww! Thanks for the tweet! I am still a bit sad about not being there. But looking forward to the US Nationals in March.
Just got a much needed haircut and color :) #lookgoodplaygood
My stitches are out! Another week or two and I will be as good as new. #healing
@GretaPete That is awesome! I hope they like it :)
Winning feels so good...literally! Rocking my new @patsgym hoody as the January Challenge winner. #noregrets http://t.co/ukFz4rlJNU
@db10er has "man plans" so I have my own "food plans" !! #partyofone
Born and raised in Seattle...wonder who I am cheering for ;) #Seahawks
All my babies :) Love Saturday mornings with my little Emma and @db10er!! http://t.co/rB9zTg8FJh
@marksme Thank you! I have run into atypical mole biopsies (of varying degrees) most of my life so I am a regular at the dermatologist! :)
@marksme I had a malignant melanoma in situ excised from my calf. Luckily it was caught early and I will be fine. Just need to stay off it.
@DanSchlicht Sounds like fun!  A great beer and a big screen is all you need!
When you have to stay away from a lower body workout...you end up doing a lot of pull-ups, push-ups and shoulder press with @patsgym !
Growth is born out of vulnerability and taking risks. #noregrets
Nice work @AnneFHughes!!! Way to go!!
Thankful 4 @patsgym cause he is always challenging me. Today it was 5 min plank...catch was U had 2 do as many push-ups in that time. 86!
@marksme I am as real and quite ordinary as they come :) Have a great one!
All the pull-ups (7-1 x2 ladder) and deadlifts from Wednesday have kicked in...ouch...I am sore! #recovery
@marksme I agree! It still hurts but I am lucky to be able to call myself an Olympian and to have gone in 2010.
@marksme We lost the Trials final so we won't be going to the Olympics :( But we will be going to the US Nationals in March :)
@myriad_of_ideas It did, thank you!
@myriad_of_ideas @adamcarolla Thank you for the suggestion!
@Erik_in_Raleigh Thanks :)
I have a lot on my mind...predicting a difficult time falling asleep. Time to watch some TV and zone out for the night :) #mindracing
Thankful for my thoughtful friend @mollylarson70 for bringing me lunch today from #chipotle!

Just as my muscles started to feel normal again from last weeks training...they got destroyed all over again by @patsgym. #noregrets
Obsessed with @westelm ... I have my eye on a couple pieces for the basement. Shopping online is the best!
I despise weeds...wish I had a gardner :) Ha!
Thanks @SanfordHealth for your continued support of our team as we prepare for the Olympic Trials in Fargo this November.
Good luck @db10er against Middleton. Cheering for @VeronaCavaliers!!
@bhawks399 No, but I love that show :)
@GretaPete @patsgym Burpee races, skierg races and split jump races followed with a cool down plank. Legs are beat!
The DIY network has some pretty entertaining shows...Renovation Realities...very interesting and fun watching couples try to remodel! Ha!
Headed to a workout with @patsgym. I can only imagine what is in store for a Saturday morning workout :)
Trying to keep our basement project moving forward. Slight hiccup but hoping to get back on track. #makeithappen #GC
10-1 ladder KTE, 5 min Farmer Walk w/ 2 x 40 lbs KB, 5 min ring plank and #skierg to "cool down" ... And throw in 80 burpees :) #noregrets
Awesome workout with @patsgym today!  Feeling so strong :)
@SweetSoulBoots That would be really sweet!! :)
Wish I could participate in the #JD19 Golf outing today. But alas I get to spend the day with my peanut while @db10er takes care of #bizness
Love this!! #98DaysToShine #noregrets http://t.co/qLRPBLml76”
My Friday night date at the park :) http://t.co/psMNyVPZ9a
Thanks to @SanfordHealth for renewing their sponsorship of our curling team. We appreciate the support, as we go for gold!
@GretaPete @AnneFHughes It went pretty good...better than expected given the distance aspect :) Although @patsgym might think otherwise...
@Sharks4Cup I think it is very important to train and play together. I do not believe an all-star team in curling would be successful.
@AnneFHughes @patsgym I am doing the tortuous ski-erg workout in 1 minute. Eck!!
@kittygilles @concept2 Getting close...I can feel it :)
Super excited to see the drywall go up tomorrow in our basement. Moving right along :)
@patsgym didn't disappoint...delts are screaming and my core feels worked over. #lovetraining #noregrets
It has been a day! Feeling like a hamster in a wheel...moving as fast as I can but not feeling like I have gotten anywhere! #typicalMonday
First class to Madison #boom #thanksdelta
Good luck @db10er !! Hit a homer for Emma and I ;)
Landed in MSP. Going to have breakfast with Nat before we connect for home. Great weekend with the team. #buildingblocks #noregrets
In the airport, heading home. Good bye Fort Wayne!

Looking forward to hitting the ice at 8am.
Al and I practiced in Fort Wayne and had a yummy dinner at a local hotspot.
@db10er What is stressing you out?
Love the Delta Sky Lounge :)
On my way to the airport. Looking forward to flying into Fort Wayne and starting this season off with a bang! #noregrets #makeitcount
Packed and ready to go! Looking forward to competing this weekend. #curling #noregrets
Feeling great after a challenging workout, snuggle time with Emma and grocery run complete.

Good luck to the @VeronaCavaliers today!
Solid game tonight! Another game tomorrow vs. China. #noregrets #makeitcount

What a great day...got to catch some rays for lunch at The Free House. #rare to actually leave my desk ;)
@patsgym Great QOTD! Totally must have been someone who has never suffered on the #airdyne :)
I always feel better after @patsgym kicks my butt in the gym :) Thanks @patsgym !!
Our basement is starting to come together. Super excited :)
Getting some reps in while Emma naps. #burpees #pushups #atomics #pullups #gobletsquatsonbosu #noregrets #makeitcount
@db10er  and I made one of our favs for dinner...enchiladas...so delicious!!
Productive little Saturday. Prepping fruit and veggies for the week. Planning out my workout for tonight.
@rickmcmanus2 That is awesome!! Have a great night :)
Fun catching up with friends this evening :)
Had a challenging workout today with @patsgym ... then when it was all said and done I had to go all out on the ski-erg ... #sore #recovery
Totally agree :) “@AnneFHughes: @patsgym agree.  thanks for high expectations and grueling workouts. Best trainer in madison!”
Getting squared away with all cabinets, countertops, flooring etc for our basement. It is going to be sweet!
Traded in my blackberry for an iPhone 5...good thing the iPad has helped me learn to navigate this! #olddognewtricks
Gearing up for a busy day tomorrow...
@kittygilles How's the rower? :) Ours needs the basement to be completed before it gets the test run.
Going to be picking up my #Concept2 rower today. Getting excited!
Best. Domestic. Purchase. Ever. #Dyson = Amazing. Costco had a great instant rebate that was the best deal! Have fun @db10er :)
@db10er Lucky for you it folds down easily to store if needed for a party. #getonboard #olympian #RoadToSochi
@db10er LOL...you get a bar in the basement and I get workout equipment. #happywifehappylife #boom
Getting excited for the delivery of my very own #Concept2 rower.  I am sure @db10er  is equally excited :) #ooooppppssss
@marksme It is hard to believe the time has gone so fast. Getting excited!
Another fun bridal shower for my SIL. Celebrated with @Korbel1882 of course!
Finally sitting down for the first time all day...productive/fun but busy day. Nice 2 have my parents around to help knock out some to-do's.
Word that makes me nervous when I am training with @patsgym ... ROUNDS ... no rest, just work. Love the challenge! #noregrets #makeitcount
Girls night at chez moi. Fun to have friends over for yummy food and good convo.
@LeonPurvis Thanks for sharing! Good luck getting Gabby to say "yes" to a date :)
New move today...reverse burpees...going to feel this workout tomorrow...well played @patsgym!
@BBitt That cracked me up!
I love a good storm! #thunder #lightning #hail #boom
We have the permit for finishing our basement...yahoo! #excited
Enjoyed a productive but relaxing Sunday. Ready to get this week going...
Dinner at Paisan's...cannot wait. Love downtown Madison!
@patsgym Harder!!! Seriously sweating and getting a great lower body workout!
Thank you to @patsgym...all that training has paid off for the pedaling tonight! LOL
Second stop...the Vintage!
14 person bike...first stop...the Echo Tap...earning that drink :) http://t.co/gz8zwisDFB
Getting on the 14 seater Capitol Pedaler...giddy up!
Getting excited for my SIL's shower / bachelorette!
Snuggles with Emma this morning. Her toothy little smile from her crib in the morning is the best. She's so excited to see her mama :) #love
@db10er  What happened? Sounds bad...
Got in a workout after Emma went to sleep. Now it is time to relax :)
@patsgym warned me today would be a killer workout...he didn't disappoint. #boom #noregrets #makeitcount
A celebration is not complete until you pop the top on a bottle of @Korbel1882 ... Celebrating our Anniversary!
Happy Anniversary to my hubby @db10er!
Worked up to heavy front squats and then settled into 10 x heavy squats / erg sprint. #noregrets #makeitcount
@MrVersaBowl Good tip! Thank you!
@mtkr Thank you! I appreciate it!
Working on finding the "right" under-counter fridge for our basement...suggestions?
Got some quality snuggle time in with Emma when I got home...missed my little peanut.
Bummer...went against my better judgement and should have gone the back way home for the last 60 miles. At a stand still...
Morning practice in Blaine. Then back on the road!
The "youngsters" on the team enjoying a drink on the rooftop in celebration of Al :) http://t.co/Tt51kxrUSY
Celebrating Allison's birthday at Crave! So fun to be out with the ladies relaxing at a nice dinner.
Day 2 on the ice...solid practice and a fun game against @Shoostie2010.
Happy Saturday! Another day on the ice with the ladies. Looking forward to some practice games. #curling
@HilldaleDental Absolutely! At least 2 times a day...gotta keep that winning smile looking good :)
So much good music out right now! Jammed the whole way here...starting to believe Nat...maybe I do have a voice like Mariah...or maybe not;)
Fit in a workout at Pat's Gym on my way out of town. Heading to the cities for a team on-ice training weekend.
Sometimes you need a reminder of where you have been and what you have accomplished to help shape where you are going. #noregrets
@pics_curling No worries...it is quite the last name!
@pics_curling Hi! Thanks for the tweet...FYI my last name is spelled Joraanstad :)
@HilldaleDental It was a tough one but I grinned through it! Lots of burpee pull-ups, erg, feet to hands (core) today.
Burpee pull-ups! I can't say I am surprised :) Feeling strong, thanks @patsgym! #noregrets #makeitcount #boom
Heading to the gym for a workout with @patsgym. He has really been on a burpee kick so I am sure he won't disappoint!
Looking forward to the weekend! Back in Blaine for on-ice training with the team :)
@db10er is addicted to the AMC series The Walking Dead...it freaks me out!
Took some PTO over lunch to go pick out finishes for our basement at Nonn's...super excited!
Work...workout with @patsgym...more work.
@BennyHeebz Congrats! Love the name...and she is totally the boss :)
Happy 30th Birthday to my hubby @db10er! :)
Our team has a new FB page...please "like" to follow us on our journey this season :) https://t.co/KY1Jp8EE0o
Earned a Sow's Ear latte and big bowl of oatmeal. #fuel
I need more cals before I do morning workouts with you @patsgym :) #destroyed #funtimes
8am workout filled with burpee pull-ups, squats, box jumps, burpee jumps, press and ski-erg race...should have eaten more cals! #noregrets
I am not a fan of watching scary/thrillers...I am a wuss...I know it. #nightmares Thanks @db10er!
On my way to workout with @patsgym before work. #noregrets #makeitcount
Impromptu grill out with friends...ends a fantastic 4th of July!
@AnneFHughes @patsgym Way to go :)
Good luck @db10er and the @VeronaCavaliers. Time to hit some bombs and get that streak back! #htlchamps
@rickmcmanus2 Thanks :)
Happy 4th of July! Looking forward to putting something red, white and blue on Emma ;)
@db10er @patsgym Blizzard? That is on the approved "cheat" list after all the time I have spent working out this last week!
Solid workout with @patsgym after work. Then proceeded to nearly burn the house down making salmon. @db10er is now making a food run!
@Sharks4Cup It is great...always entertaining ;)
Happy Gilmore on Netflix...never gets old!
Relaxing after a great team weekend full of curling and working out with @patsgym. Thanks to @patsgym for helping us out, you rock!
Lost :( But I guess that means one more workout tomorrow morning with the team! Wonder what @patsgym will plan...
On at 5pm...should be a good battle!
Relaxing on Allison's porch...beautiful day out.
Productive morning...another WIN and another workout led by @patsgym. #noregrets #boom
Heading to our 8am game. Starbucks latte in hand. Let's get a W.
Game #1 = Win. On at 8am...time for sleep.  Ice is great!
Fun working out as a group and @patsgym destroyed us! #recover #noregrets #makeitcount
@traineatrecover @patsgym We killed it ;) Wrecked from this week of training!
@paulhesco In it, to win it! :)
@patsgym and I made it to Minnesota. Meeting the team for lunch and then we are going to go kill it in the gym. #boom #noregrets
All packed and ready to kick the #curling season off this weekend in Blaine. Looking forward to hitting the ice! #noregrets #makeitcount
@rickmcmanus2 Me too! Luckily the new facility is well equipped!
@PriceAtkinson @Sochi2014 Thank you! Appreciate the support :)
Cannot wait for the curling season to kick off this weekend in Minnesota...looking forward to seeing the ladies!
@FaneEric LOL - It is not my style but I think individual style is what's important. Rock on with your turtleneck sweater!
Rare night out with @db10er...nice to have some adult time together.
Killed it at my workout with @patsgym today...ski-erg ladder, burpee pull-ups, KB swings, and GHD sit-ups.
Olympism is persevering through the ups and the downs...training and competing each day with #noregrets! #OlympicDay
Happy #OlympicDay!! So proud to be an Olympian :)
Pulling weeds...does that count as working out?
@AnneFHughes I like it too but it is going to be a challenging few days in my house with stairs. :)
100 back squats at 105lbs (2 steps, 2 squats...) and some burpee pull-ups...good day in the gym!
Shoulders are burned out from my workout...guess that means my workout tomorrow might involve my legs :)
Looking forward to my workout with @patsgym!
Night out! http://t.co/l5l4JRSSiG
Day 4 at #shrm13...heading back to Madison, WI today. It has been a fun journey!
@rickmcmanus2 Thanks! I appreciate it :)
At Sweet Water on Michigan Ave for dinner with the girls!
Day #3 at the #shrm13 conference in Chicago.
Hey @justbut! In your neck of the woods...go blackhawks!

Hanging out with Ike #iCIMS at #shrm13. http://t.co/fRX1T45Wny
Sitting on the floor for lunch :( Looking forward to a chair in the next session! :) #boom #shrm13
Feeling inspired by the keynote speaker Blake Mycoskie at #shrm2013. What a great concept! #startsomethingthatmatters
On our way to downtown Chicago and a deer just went across 8 lanes of traffic. Almost caused a major collison but we made it!
It has been a productive weekend so far with lots of family time. And...a little golf on TV too.
Enjoyed some much needed time off this afternoon and caught up with friends. #recharge #lovefriday
When traffic makes you 30 minutes late to train with @patsgym ... You have to train smart to get maximum benefit out of the time you have!
@AnneFHughes - You go girl :)
Met the ladies for lunch at the Sow's Ear...it was nice enough to sit outside and watch the "hometown" parade. #newtradition
“@Korbel1882: @NicCurl Thrilled to sponsor such incredible athletes! Cheers to you!” - We heart Korbel! :)
@patsgym LOL - surprised????
2 a days...well 2 long walks today...#recovery #stillsore
Sent @db10er a text...only moments later I heard the beep coming from a pile of clothes...guess he won't get that til he gets home. #nothere
@rickmcmanus2 Totally agree! It was a crazy one :)
Happy it is Friday...considering on Tuesday at 8:30am I made the statement to my pal Lexi that "it has been a long week"...imagine today!
On a long walk with Emma. She is chanting mama. Awesome!
@AnneFHughes @patsgym Thanks...I am getting there...slow and steady!!
@AnneFHughes @patsgym @NathanEnglander The bamboo bar is a fun new challenge for sure :)
Yeah! Thanks for telling me I could do this @patsgym!! “@patsgym: Nice PR of 215 @NicCurl http://t.co/C6AyyPpZT2”
A huge shout-out to @Korbel1882 for renewing their sponsorship with our team. No time like the present for a glass of bubbly to celebrate!
Another curling entry sent in for the fall. We are all set for pre-trials events...now on to post-trials events :) #noregrets #makeitcount
Dragonfly Hot Yoga Fit class was awesome this AM. A great mix of weights, yoga and good music! Going to do that again.
Headed to Dragonfly Hot Yoga for a Fit class. Morning kick start!
@JTScan_13 @db10er Wow. Who ended the run?
@AnneFHughes @patsgym BTW - I can just now start moving from my workouts this week! Going to get after it right now...Emma is asleep :)
@DavidBurgenske @NJKrohn vs. @JTScan_13 @db10er This is sure to be a battle...hoping for live twitter feeds straight from the source...
@JTScan_13 @db10er Go in with a game plan but know when to bail... #keytowinning #tsnturningpoint
@db10er @JTScan_13 Good luck dominating the shuffleboard tonight!
Sow's Ear with Katie! Emma is becoming a regular with me at the coffee shop :) Perfect Saturday morning.
Planning an afternoon workout at home while Emma naps. I see burpees in my future :)
Enjoying the night from our deck. Love the summer!
Looking forward to a kick-butt workout with @patsgym after work. #noregrets #makeitcount
Love thunderstorms...reminds me of living in Seattle :)
@patsgym brought back the "complex" for the first time in awhile...do 8 movements / 6 times each with a barbell...add weight and repeat.
Thanks to all those who have served or are serving the great U S of A! #memorialday #thankyou
@marksme Thanks! She is such a good baby...very blessed!
@RickSwansonNY Thanks! Hard to believe she is 8 1/2 months old already...wow!
Loving the pictures that we had taken of Emma. She is growing so fast! http://t.co/T907p48FWz
So excited for the "extra" day off tomorrow! #makeitcount
Enjoyed a late morning excursion to the Sow's Ear for a latte and brunch with the ladies. #favoritelocalcoffeeshop
It has been a great little Saturday! Although... @db10er has been dragging a bit. #notyounganymore #1nightout2dayrecover
Went on a long walk with Emma tonight. Weather is perfect :)
Hi @AnneFHughes ! @patsgym told me he made you do feet to hands and you got just as mad as I did ;) #trick #unbelievable
My core was tested tonight at my workout with @patsgym ... predicting a very sore core for several days. #noregrets #makeitcount
Cannot wait for the long weekend. I need some major R&amp;R! Running on fumes :(
Sounds like @daxshepard1 needs 2 get schooled in curling from an Olympian. I would be happy 2 set him straight on the sport &amp; our uniforms.
Who needs to work out when you do 2 hours of lawn work after a 45 minute walk with Miss Emma! Joys of home ownership...
Successful shopping adventure! Even had lunch with @db10er. Time for the spa!
Taking some time off this afternoon for "me" time.  Pedicure, shopping and a massage :)  I couldn't be more excited!
Thanks to @TrainEatRecover for putting me through a workout in @patsgym's absence. I am going to be sore! #makeitcount #noregrets
@tagbattle20010 I sure hope so! Olympic Trials are in November.
6 weeks until we start curling again....soooooo excited :)
Grip strength was tested in my workout with @patsgym today. Some heavy front squats too!
Bought new shoes online! Cannot wait to see them tomorrow...#onlineshopping #neednotawant :)
@db10er Finally!! This is good news!
It might be a 2 latte kind of day...
I fit in a workout while Emma sleeps...multi-tasking at its finest! #makeitcount #noregrets
Happy Mother's Day everyone!!
@db10er owned the lawn today! All this work is going to pay off with a nice lush green lawn.
Serenity now...love Seinfeld! Feeling that today:)
@AnneFHughes @patsgym I do want to try that sometime!
Thanks @patsgym for proving yet again that I am getting stronger and stronger with each workout. Feeling like my old self again! #noregrets
@Rebob1958 Unfortunately no :( That is the final weekend of our Olympic Trials...hoping to earn our spot to Sochi!
Thank you @db10er for that Heath blizzard from @DairyQueen :)
Team schedule is set...cannot wait to kick things off! #noregrets #allout
It is so nice out! Wish every day was just like this. Perfect! #lovespring
I've accomplished so much in the last two hours...guess I get to hang out and relax with my peanut all day while dad plays baseball! :)
Time to workout! You don't need a lot of equipment to do a killer at home workout. #noregrets  #makeitcount
Planning out my workout for tomorrow... #noregrets #makeitcount
Took Emma out for her first dinner at a restaurant...well she was out eating her baby food and we got a meal out with fam!
150 KB Swings, 150 Goblet Squats, 70 Deck Squat/Jump/Ball Slams...then let's do pull-ups and rows. Thanks @patsgym !!
@AnneFHughes @patsgym :) Good times!!
@tc110 We did heavy push press w/ Airdyne time/cal goals ladder then push-ups w/ Skierg time/meters goals ladder. My muscles are mush :)
Asked @patsgym for the puke bucket today during my workout...I survived but it was very challenging. #noregrets #makeitcount
Happy Monday! Attacking the week already...love it!
One flight away from @db10er and my little Emma :)
Relaxing and working in the MSP Delta Sky Lounge. #longlayover #workinghard #multitasking
@davidogravelle Thanks for having me! I had a blast!
@janarama39 Safe travels!
On my flight from Charlotte to MSP...then layover in MSP until my flight tonight to Madison.
I had SO much fun w/ the #HotShots in Charlotte. It was fun 2 meet so many great people and talk #curling. Truly an awesome experience!
Time to rest up for the big grudge match at the Hot Shots camp this evening after dinner. #gotime #makeitcount
Defended my "world record time" in the balloon race this evening at the Hot Shots Camp.  #boom #stillgotit
It is so fun to watch the hot Shots partcipants strengthen their deliveries right before our eyes. So cool! #lovenc #curling #arenaice
Hot Shots camp kicks off in an hour...looking forward to meeting all the participants :)
At dinner with all the Hot Shots instructors in NC and Mr. Earle Morris got carded...classic! #younglooking #21? #goodtimes
@billvoth Yes at the Extreme Ice Center...on the flight right now headed to NC. Looking forward to seeing the rink.
@TheHammerhead81 @db10er I am terrible at shuffleboard! Should be better! LOL
@billvoth I am instructing at a camp through Sunday afternoon. Excited to hit the ice!
Hello from 10,000 feet...love go-go wi-fi :)
Flight delays out of MSN...hoping to be on my way to Detroit shortly.  Might be close with my connection to Charlotte!
Packing for NC...pulling out the capri shorts...need sun...and curling.
@djrosenberry Totally! I have work listed as "do not disturb" so I made them follow me to the gym since I was heading there. Ha!
@DavidOGravelle LOL - passed with flying colors!
@Nathaniel_1975 We used weights ... Ouch!
Had some "visitors" at work that followed me to Pat's Gym...USADA random drug test wasn't in @patsgym's plan :) http://t.co/CaVBD2V7T1
If you have ever done a weighted burpee...you know my pain! Going to feel this tomorrow. Wow.
Getting excited to instruct at the Hot Shots camp in Charlotte this weekend! #curling
Wishing there was another day of the weekend :(
Sunday breakfast treat...all natural cinnamon rolls. They were delicious!
Sitting with @db10er as he searches for the best "instrumentals" for walking into a sporting event...hilarious and entertaining!
Grilled out with friends = Perfect night!
Relaxing weekend on tap. Much needed after another busy week. Time to re-energize. That starts with a latte!
@db10er and I are glued to CNN Live coverage...
TGIF - Happy Friday!
Had a great night out with friends...I feel re-energized :)
Killer workout with @patsgym today...every muscle in my body got worked over. Stronger, better, faster...#noregrets
Our team schedule is coming together! So excited to play. #noregrets #makeitcount
Wow! I was challenged in the gym today by @patsgym. I can barely move already...but I survived :)
Praying for Boston. So sad and senseless!
Love watching the Masters...what a finish!
Sow's Ear for breakfast with Natalie and Stella. Nothing like a great latte and friends :)
@Sachcurl Thanks for coming to visit us! We need to do this more often!!
It is so fun having Natalie and Stella visit us :)
Emma's photoshoot last Sunday...too cute KLP! http://t.co/lWQFd3CEos
Signed up for our first summer spiel in June...should be fun and nice to get ice time! #noregrets
Hard work pays off! Going to be a great week. #noregrets
Dinner out with the work team! Fun times...
@Sachcurl They fly in at 4:45pm so 6pm. Does that work?
@Sachcurl @db10er will grill out :) Side dish?
Miss Emma and I before her photo shoot today...cannot believe she will be 7 months tomorrow! http://t.co/VkmVE5Ke0M
Watching the Men's World Gold Medal game on Universal.
Working and watching curling on Universal. Love curling on TV :)
@Sachcurl Dinner at my house on Friday?
Happy Weekend! For me it will involve working...Implementing new application on Monday for tracking candidates...#bigdeal #lifeofemployee
@Sachcurl Miss you! Are you going to visit with Nat and I next weekend?
@tc110 @patsgym I am! My core felt it the next day for sure!
@SeansatFOH @patsgym Yes indeed! Great workout!
@Mike_Christian I can only imagine :)
@Jeffrey_Pfaff Worse! You have to walk and the bungee kettle bells no uncle all around. Core killer!
@tc110 Good question!  @patsgym - what is this called?  I think of it as bungee kettlebell walks :)
@SeansatFOH My trainer @patsgym will then start to get the kettlebells bouncing on either side as I walk &amp; that is when the core takes over!
This is way harder than it looks! http://t.co/IUcFGmaOnX
It was all about the core today at my workout with @patsgym...going to feel this tomorrow!
Work, work and more work! I think I hit a record high last week...might get there this week too! Thankful I only have off-ice training now.
Happy Easter!!
Thank you Syracuse! Now I need Duke on Sunday. #stayingalive #bracket
Relaxing Saturday...coffee shop for breakfast and watching movies. Workout planned for later this afternoon :)
Kansas...OT...really...nervous. Let's go Kansas! #bracket
Grilling out for dinner ... So excited :)
Enjoyed the afternoon with Emma and going to head out for a walk on this beautiful day. Happy Friday!
@DanKarell15 I need Syracuse :)
Working and watching basketball...yeah...I am worried about my tournament picks :)
The Airdyne was a mighty challenge today with @patsgym. I wanted to give up but I kept going until the end. #noregrets #makeitcount
@tc110 @patsgym Will do! Maybe we can do a vid tomorrow. Thanks!
It is finally warming up a bit...I was so excited to take Emma out for a walk today after work...my hamstrings appreciated the stretch too!
KB Swings, Goblet Squats, Deadlifts and Lunges were in my workout with @patsgym today...my hamstrings are already finding walking difficult!
Check out our new Team Pottinger Facebook site and "like" please :)
Planning out my off-ice training for the week...time to amp it up now that the ice is out for a little bit. #noregrets #makeitcount
Helping mommy cheer on her bracket picks :) http://t.co/hGo9vYba9R
Watching curling on Universal...makes me wish I was playing right now. #focusontrials
Overhauling the food in my kitchen...
Morning workout with @patsgym!  Drinking my latte on the go.
@c_spears10 Gonzaga, Kansas, Syracuse and Duke ... We will see!!
Filled out my very FIRST NCAA tournament bracket. I do not really follow college basketball so I am certain my entry is a "donation" :)
@TheHammerhead81 @db10er It is but he did venture out in the cold at 8:30 at night :)
@db10er brought be a DQ Blizzard...what a treat! #cheatsnack #welldeserved
@tc110 Yes, absolutely! I have one I use at home as much as possible.
Considering I am still sore from a weekend workout...my workout with @patsgym this evening won't help the situation.  #noregrets
@ytsejamn @patsgym Is definitely a team supporter :) Been training me since the lead up to the 2010 Olympics.
@rickmcmanus2 Either works! As you can imagine training/travel for curling is expensive at this level! We want to get back to the Olympics!
My team is looking to add a few SPONSORS to our elite line-up for this upcoming season (Olympic Trials!). Let me know if you are interested.
@hellerbig1070 @phildawsonradio Sounds good! When we get ice in October, we will have the ultimate re-match...start the off-ice training :)
Go #Badger basketball!
You know you hit your core hard in the gym when laughing is painful! #noregrets #makeitcount
Hi @hellerbig1070 &amp; @phildawsonradio! We should have another pre-Olympic curling challenge in the fall...are you game? Oly Trials are Nov.
....breakfast!
Sow's Ear treat for
@rickmcmanus2 So true! It is funny how so much changes with a little one...wouldn't change a thing...it is so fun watching her grow :)
Target power shopping on a Saturday night for groceries and baby essentials...what has my life come too?!?!?!  :) #mommy
Looking forward to some special guests this afternoon! Cleaning while Emma naps...
@kiki_curl @tgeorge1323 @joepolo1 @jillianlmouzar Sounds like fun!
Another grueling workout in the books thanks to @patsgym. Core is tore up!
Emma is asleep so it is time for a workout...need to work out these sore muscles before my workout tomorrow...workout to workout :)
Walking = Difficult ... Guess the workout really did get me sore as expected!  #makeitcount Looking forward to another challenging one!
@mtkr @patsgym Back squats involve putting a weighted bar on your back (vs. in front or overhead)...they added up today!
@patsgym Rough might be an understatement...but hey #noregrets!
@AnneFHughes @patsgym Luckily...just need 2 make it to my desk @ work...I have about 30K lines of data waiting for me :) I won't be moving!
My workout with @patsgym involved so many back squats that I may not be able to walk again!
@BobMarchese @TheCurryGuy Thanks for the tip!
@beats_down_low I will definitely be trying that...yum!
@itsneverenuff @NicCurl Sounds very yummy!
@MattGray6 @NicCurl I need to check that out...I might be the last one to finally discover that sight...heard great things about it.
@BobMarchese @NicCurl Dinner please.
@kmdric @NicCurl *some ideas I meant!
@kmdric @NicCurl perfect! Thank you for sending me one ideas!
@MattyThePlanner @NicCurl That is going to make the rotation this week. Great idea!
@MattGray6 @NicCurl That sounds really good! Thanks a bunch!
Looking for some new meal ideas...I am in a food rut. Going to change things up. Any healthy ideas?
@InspirationMed @NicCurl Sounds good to me!
Found out today that @db10er dislikes squats....race to 100? Challenge out there, awaiting response...
Not sure who is messed up more from time change...me or Emma. The day started a bit "later" but after coffee at Sow's Ear it went downhill.
Training the mind is just as important as training the physical. #mentaltoughness #noregrets
@InspirationMed @NicCurl Thanks :) What would that entail?
Watching DIY network... #nothandy
Morning conference call with the Team...planning, planning and more planning. Love it!
@AnneFHughes @NicCurl @patsgym The "new" weighted pull-up...I like it!
@randy_lints @patsgym Good luck at the event! Proper rest and recovery is key! Off-ice training is important too.
Solid workout in the gym today...60 pull-ups knocked out. Getting back to my pre-baby form! Thanks @patsgym!
Almost passed out from an intense workout with @patsgym! It was a challenging one but I survived :)
@patsgym @NicCurl - I am finally healthy again although still sleep deprived...I have another 18+ years of that I guess :) Let's crank it!!
Words to live by... You can't keep doing the same thing and expect different results. More of the same doesn't make it better. Change it up!
Feeling inspired today... #makeitcount
Snow, snow, go away... #overwinter #needsun
Checking out the Brier standings...might watch a VOD tonight.
Feel like I need one more day to feel like I am "caught up" ... :) Looking forward to a week of work, curling and working out. #noregrets
@MattyThePlanner @NicCurl We don't have TSN so I will have to watch it online. Wish we had TSN!
@recoby4of5 @NicCurl @patsgym No but we definitely do a lot of Burpees :)
Made the weekly trek to Target...brought the fam...I am not sure how I would have managed by myself...we needed two carts! #stockedup

@VicNutter Thanks...I really appreciate the note :)
@chip3b We are in training mode but the next competition won't be until late summer / early fall :(
I feel like a hamster in a wheel...doesn't matter how fast I move my legs...I don't seem to get anywhere.
@whereishawkins I love Amazon Prime!
I'm totally obsessed with shopping online...time saver! I guess this comes with trying to do it all as a wife + mom + employee + athlete :)
Busy day at work! Topped my day off with a solid workout. Time to relax...
@delyea The Trials are in Fargo, ND.
@BagelMan85 After the Olympics we parted ways. We have been the same team since post-Olympics. We cannot wait to play!
I couldn't be more fired up to play in the Olympic Trials this November. 9 months to #makeitcount and have #noregrets. #Sochi2014
Wish I had TSN in the states so I could watch the Scotties!
What a day for Emma! She can sit on her own now. She is such a little cutie!
Thinking about hitting up hot yoga tomorrow...I need to mix it up.
Spending the day with the fam. Hard to believe how fast Emma has grown!

Sore from my workout with @patsgym. Love a challenging workout! #noregrets #makeitcount

Loving our Nespresso...nothing better than having a coffee in the comfort of your own home.
Felt good to be in the gym with @patsgym today! 9 month count down until Olympic Trials. #noregrets
@whereishawkins It is certainly a balancing act! I have a great support system and I have to be really, really organized with my schedule :)
Back to reality today :) Not too bad...I'm lucky 2 have a great job @ a great company. Training continues 4 Trials...no rest for the weary.
@Sharks4Cup We will still train as much as possible over the next 9 months! #noregrets

I have had a headache all day...I cannot figure out why.  Weird!
@marksme Totally!!  Curlers are a fairly low risk but I understand ensuring the playing field is even.
@Sharks4Cup I would say I get tested in and out of competition about 2-3 times a year.  So odd for someone to show up at my house for that!
Had an unexpected visitor this evening...USADA showed up for an "out of competition" random drug test...the joys of being an athlete :)

Spent some quality time with my nephew Will today.  He is soooo cute!  It was fun to babysit :)

Solid workout with @patsgym! Feeling strong :)
Bad storm has knocked the power out :(

@Evilpa Atomics are a core movement. Lay flat on ground (legs straight & arms straight. Bring legs in & arms up (like a v-sit).  Repeat.
@matnit08 - Good question!  Yes, it is a key component to keeping at the top of our game.  It makes a big difference :)

@subsisthippie - Eating protein after a workout is key.  If I am not having a meal right away, I will make a protein smoothie.
