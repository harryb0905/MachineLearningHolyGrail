@spikeanselm @vexedinthecity Warren and Harris
Dems have thus far had a "stick heads in sand" attitude toward here, but Republicans are doing an upsettingly competent job on messaging this &amp; that cannot stand. The vote today was all about putting Dems on the record against "The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act" !! https://t.co/0r9SYnwFxZ
Late-term abortions are rare but the passage of these bills has energized the anti-choice movement. Republicans, an already truth-challenged group, are going to yell "INFANTICIDE" at every turn. Dems can't ignore this, they have to fight it. (2/2) https://t.co/FXVqGMU47u
@tina_herod I get that and I'm not trying to convince people to back him, I'm just saying I hope everyone who wants to run in 2020 joins the R or D primary. I want no third party spoilers.
I really hope Dems are gearing up for this shit. Trump has already made it clear they're going to use abortion in 2020 as a big wedge issue &amp; while the majority of Americans support choice, 90% are against late term abortion (1/2)  https://t.co/r4z8gMx8Jv https://t.co/FXVqGMU47u
I'm not a Bernie stan but the "he's not a Democrat" thing is confusing to me: Wouldn't you much rather him run as a Dem than Independent and split the vote? Everyone hates Howard Schultz and he could still costs Dems the election by doing just that.

@Ed650b @HoarseWisperer Exactly

@lkmcgann This doesn‚Äôt read that way at all. It reads as a defense of her and a dismissal of this as sexist.

@akruglov @SenFeinstein ditto! where are you based?
And to be clear I'm not Green New Deal OR BUST. This is the best I've heard so far, climate has to be priority one period and we have to go BIG or lose or home.
@akruglov @SenFeinstein I'm not at allGND or bust. I'm wedded to bold action and I think tying jobs, infrastructure and environment together is genius in that it unifies labor and environmentalists for the first time since the 70s/80s but really I just want it to be priority 1.
@akruglov @SenFeinstein Great, Alex, you do that and I'll hold pols feet to the fire til they promise not to continue their disastrous policy of doing absolutely fucking nothing
@rickscottrod That's the genius of tying jobs, infrastructure and climate together. For exactly the reason you're talking about.
@akruglov @SenFeinstein These are great thing to aim and prep for when we need to build bipartisan consensus. Dianne could be doing that but she's not. I want commitment to work tirelessly on all this shit until it's fixed. Incrementalism hasn't worked.
@akruglov @SenFeinstein You do you, but the promise to do something big &amp; expensive &amp; radical is what *I* care about right now. We won't have control of all three chambers for at least two years, maybe four. There's time for details. I want commitment now or I want to vote for their primary opponent.
@inthehands That's up to her. Dianne can come back petty or open.
@Alllwftopic @HoarseWisperer https://t.co/mLi28UqM72
. @SenFeinstein's line about not having money to pay for the Green New Deal was much more abhorrent to me than her treatment of the kids. Climate change will much more money in the long run (and thousands of lives!)  https://t.co/ENd4DqrchP https://t.co/GduhwydJsS
Just want to hold Dems feet to the fire on the GND cause we may only have 1 shot at passing it or other bold legislation that can actually make a difference. I don't care about the rest. I want to talk abt what the past two generations that failed us on climate change owe us now.
@phlubup @HelenKennedy That's fine. I just want to talk about holding Dems feet to the fire on the GND cause we may only have one shot at passing it or other bold legislation that can actually make a difference.
@alwaysabides nah, i think they brought the omelet bar back with them
@noboa I totally forgot about that
@WhenIs2001 @eileenshorts YES!
@TheJWQ @porterguy1969 I feel like I‚Äôm going insane
@moomoof Yes!
@phlubup @HelenKennedy I know you are and I think that‚Äôs telling. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. I want to talk about climate change. All this deflection around the motives of children: Who cares! The upshot is she is a leader from CALIFORNIA who doesn‚Äôt support bold action on climate change
@AlwaysThinkHow @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt lol ok buddy
Thank you. I just want to talk about climate policy. I do not hate Dianne, she has been a strong leader in important issues. But we have to get this together and blaming activists to protect the powerful from this debate is just gross https://t.co/mQku8KfOEv
@porterguy1969 lol, my candidate in 2016 was Hillary and yes they are facts. You sound very Trumpy right now.
He‚Äôs actually at 42% which is still 42% too high https://t.co/MGAfztoU1d https://t.co/cUzSAVD0qC
@AwfulJournalism Here are some actual facts about what pols knew and when https://t.co/D1N4Upjfs3
@doccandidate I agree about Gore. Tragic. And AOC has very little to do with this. Yes, Republicans are mostly to blame on climate but we have held the senate, house &amp; WH house at the same time for ten years out of the last 30 and did nothing substantial on climate change. It‚Äôs upsetting.
@phlubup @HelenKennedy All of this could have been avoided by Feinstein not being a jerk to them or fighting for real works on climate change. A lot of things would have been great. Can we now talk about the GND and not worry so much about a powerful women‚Äôs feelings?
@eileenshorts The civility police shit means very little to me honestly. I don‚Äôt dislike Dianne, but she needs a kick in the pants and that‚Äôs all this was and I will not apologize for hurting anyone‚Äôs wittwe feewings
@meechebucco @chaddalrymple @wulfsethen @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt She has a great record for voting for small things that didn‚Äôt do much. All Dems do. They knew 30 years ago this was a huge problem &amp; didn‚Äôt take the appropriate action &amp; we‚Äôre fucked. This is mostly on R‚Äôs but also on D‚Äôs Who didnt fight every day like our lives depended on it
@nonunaspiare I disagree but even if it was shame is a good thing: It sets the limits of what is acceptable in a society and not acting on climate change when we have a matter of years left is unacceptable. Why is everyone so protective of her? She‚Äôs a strong lady!
@JMoLawre So true
@eileenshorts @WhenIs2001 Why? They are her constituents. She showed her true colors on the issue which is in line with the last 30 years of inaction. She was shamed in the public space &amp; may hear her constituents as a result. It‚Äôs always amazing to me when people tell others they are doing activism wrong
@CardiganCorg Russia is not behind the kids asking Feinstein to act on climate change
@Mikel_Jollett Thank you, I really needed this sane take today after being told repeatedly Russia was behind this https://t.co/OYA51AGrv5
@HillaryPolitics @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt A) the kids know that they were asking for her to support it when it happens. B) you‚Äôre getting lost in the weeds here‚Äîthe point is to push urgent action on climate the minute we control congress and the White House. Period.
@rawe1nce Their parents brought them there and you can‚Äôt prove a negative. The onus would be on you to prove the positive.
I‚Äôm not gonna make it, guys https://t.co/uBf1wbm4zU
@eileenshorts They need a wake up call. They need to be pushed to left. That‚Äôs all this was and the reaction from her defenders has been breathtaking.
@eileenshorts I don‚Äôt care if she was nice to the kids I care she said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not gonna fix it in 12 years‚Äù and was dismissive. Nothing else matters if we don‚Äôt act on climate change and our politicians have failed us wildly on the subject
@eileenshorts There is built up anger from me and others that they have landed us here. Silent and Boomer generations did nothing and now we have 12 years or we‚Äôre fucked so I‚Äôm pissed we have to ‚Äúwin her over‚Äù at all. She should feel the righteous anger that‚Äôs healthy.
@HoarseWisperer I like you but I couldn‚Äôt disagree more here. ‚ÄúUnexpected target‚Äù? She‚Äôs their senator‚Äîpeople come by the office all the time. She works for them! And I watched the whole video and think the clip (put up at that length cause twitter has a time limit) is an accurate represention
@ReliableSources @davidfolkenflik @JohnAvlon @CharlesMBlow @jacobwe @mitrakalita @JohnHMcWhorter @LZGranderson @Egangoonsquad @secupp @CNN Are y‚Äôall gonna finally talk about that crazy CNN hire honestly?
@HelenKennedy So no one should ever post videos on twitter? I watched the whole thing and the short one and thought the clip was very representative of the whole.
@WhenIs2001 THANK YOU
@nonunaspiare WHO IS TEARING IT DOWN??? What those kids were doing was EXACTLY pushing it to the left. This is exactly what's driving me nuts.
@eileenshorts Eileen, they are saying that. Look through twitter.   I watched the whole video &amp; the clip they put on twitter &amp; see no discrepancy. I thought it well represented what went on in that room. It's nice she offered them internships-that's great-but her attitude on climate was not.
@HelenKennedy That's a nonsense take. Those kids went in their in earnest as far as I can tell https://t.co/6gFxWzH63S &amp; the video wasn't doctored: Twitter has a time limit for videos so it was clipped but the whole thing was made available elsewhere.
@rawe1nce I saw one person do that and she was promptly and thoroughly mocked for it as she should have been but I really don't think that was a wide-spread idea. Twitter is a nutty place. And no, that's a lie about the kids https://t.co/6gFxWzH63S
@doccandidate @ManInTheHoody link?
@hdot42 @doccandidate @ManInTheHoody What substantial thing has been done? Please tell me cause the scientists disagree with you. And of course R's are the enemy here which is why to win back we should have bold proposals that we are all behind to show we are the only option to save the planet.
@HillaryPolitics @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt A Democratic president and senate. Nothing can be done without that and looking at the maps it's unlikely we have it til 2022. That's not deceptive it's a fact you need those chambers to create change.
@alwaysabides YES ugh
It's a fact that pols have done little if anything substantial about climate change for 30 years. You are treating that fact as an attack &amp; then saying "HOW DARE YOU ATTACK DIANNE" It's insane "logic," bizarre defensiveness &amp; does not speak well of your intellectual honesty.
@AlwaysThinkHow @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt I never said she has done nothing. I said she and the rest of the politicians in America have done nothing substantial about climate change in 30 years. That's a fact. If you don't like facts I do suggest you unfollow me. https://t.co/D1N4Upjfs3
These people are so unhinged. We're trying to have a fucking policy debate and they are taking it so personally. That video was not manipulative, it was representative. The idea that we can never criticize anyone on our own side is so nuts. https://t.co/RvJyCgnQ3J
@wulfsethen @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt lol
@PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt Amazing how personally you are all taking this. Dianne is great but holding her feet to the fire is not an attack. The actual attacks on AOC for dancing &amp; shit are hilarious nonsense but policy debates are what we should be having &amp; it's nuts to me you're all so scared of it
@HillaryPolitics @PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt We have broad strokes and two-three years to flesh it out. That's not a problem. Announcing large, bold policy goals is something Dems should have been doing before this.
@PamKeithFL @billmckibben @SenFeinstein @sunrisemvmt Pam, we cannot make a compelling case that R's like Cory are the problem if D's like Dianne show we might not do anything about it either! Her seat is safe for now, this isn't damaging the democrats, it's invigorating them and letting hold outs know the stakes are high.
@PamKeithFL @ArtMorelli @billmckibben If she wants to put pettiness above principal that's on her &amp; it would be yet more evidence she doesn't care about the planet. But besides that she'll be 86 in a couple mos &amp; CA could have a new senator at any given moment. Things like this keep priorities fresh in people's mind.
@c_singh_ @d_fu66 @PamKeithFL @MalcolmNance Ditto the whole "WATCH THE WHOLE VIDEO" nonsense is pure gaslighting
@PamKeithFL @ArtMorelli @billmckibben There's no evidence she wants to save the environment beyond small votes on incremental changes that haven't done much. Maybe this pressures her into thinking more about the green new deal or maybe it just wakes CAers up to the idea their next senator should be a leader on it
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/HDAmYaWQvl
@ArtMorelli @PamKeithFL @billmckibben That‚Äôs how the internet works and good on those kids for making this a discussion. Many of us have been screaming about inaction on this for years and now there‚Äôs a reason people will argue with us about it.
@RadioFreeTom A lot?
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC Twitter really needs a ‚Äúreport dumbasses‚Äù option. Not so you‚Äôre suspended just so you can be made aware just how many people think you‚Äôre an idiot at any given time.
@ArtMorelli @PamKeithFL @billmckibben We rely on Dems to be the moral voice here. If she doesn't like the green new deal let's hear her alternative but shooting it down without having a big bold plan is unacceptable at this moment in time. I'm disappointed because I respect her not because I don't (2/2)
@ArtMorelli @PamKeithFL @billmckibben Art, that moment is not the indictment, her inaction is. And it's obviously not just Feinstein, it's all of them. They were told 30 years ago about the problem and have done almost nothing about it. https://t.co/D1N4Upjfs3 (1/2)
@doccandidate @ManInTheHoody so because Gore was screwed it was ok for the senate to abdicate all responsibility on the subject?
@frazierapproves an ex of mine shared a screengrab of this on FB and I loved it so much I came and tracked you down ;)

‚ÄúThose kids were being counterproductive‚Äù I say while having a two-day debate about climate change for the first time all year. üòè
@akruglov Literally our best shot rn is the green new deal and she showed no interest in supporting it. The video those kids made has us all talking about it for two days and that‚Äôs magic in this insane media environment.
@akruglov I believe in my kids being able to live on the East Coast.
@classiclib3ral @virgiltexas My favorite are the boomers in my mentions saying the kids were being unreasonable when we all know the planet is very reasonable and likely to come around
@oneunderscore__ https://t.co/MiNmWaWkOM
@akruglov Defending her is no more tenable than agreeing with her.
@akruglov This "practical" shit is exactly the problem, Alex. They created a huge problem now insist we play by their incrementalist rules to fix it. The climate doesn't play by their nonsense rules. Stop trying to convince people this is sanity when it is clearly insane.
The past two generations of US leaders (Silent and Boomer) have bee complete failures on the most important issue we face: Climate change. This is a fact and the defensiveness of people who want to pretend otherwise is mind-boggling.
@akruglov Alex, she doesn‚Äôt support the green new deal. She‚Äôs been in the senate for decades and has done nothing meaningful to stop this‚Äînone of them have. Paying lip service and voting the ‚Äúright‚Äù way on bills that do small things here and there is nonsense in the face of this problem
@peppersandeggs @KatTimpf The right has never been good at deciphering comedy because they‚Äôre bad at it in general
@akruglov Something very serious needs to be done or this planet will become uninhabitable. If you are not fighting every day for this shit, you don‚Äôt care.
@berkfran lol how dare young people want you to fix the mess you made before we doom the planet.

There is no green new deal or Medicare for All with the filibuster or this illigit court in place. We only have 12 years to stop climate change‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have time for this shit and @SenSanders @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris are wasting our time if they‚Äôre not willing to change it
They‚Äôre destroying democracy with minority rule. They stole the court with Garland/Gorsuch &amp; put a sexual harasser &amp; sexual assaulter on the court as well. It‚Äôs not legitimate now. + The filibuster has to go. Any candidate not willing to talk abt these things is not my candidate
We cannot play by two sets of rules. When Republicans destroy norms it is not Dems responsibility to put it back together, it is their responsibility to represent their constituents. If R‚Äôs get their national emergency, we do ours (but for real emergency), we pack the court, etc

@HerbSpeaks @ParkerMolloy I don‚Äôt know if it does any more but Stuyvesant used to have a class called ‚ÄúThe Bible as Literature''
@PoliticlPikachu @HerbSpeaks @ParkerMolloy It‚Äôs often taught in chunks. Especially in English classes. It‚Äôs very hard to understand all the allusions in Shakespeare and other great works without a working knowledge of the Bible.
@ChuckWendig One of my friends who does daily affirmations was telling me some people think it‚Äôs silly so she tells them ‚Äúhow many times a day do those negative voices in your head tell you the opposite. Those are negative affirmations you are doing unconsciously all day long.‚Äù
@ZerlinaMaxwell https://t.co/FgdzkGIWdC
@ZerlinaMaxwell Yup has been for at least two hours
@SMurp3131 @ParkerMolloy Hahaha, I missed that
@HerbSpeaks @ParkerMolloy It absolutely is taught as a text in public schools. It cannot be taught as a devotional tool. But it‚Äôs a book like any other.
@ParkerMolloy It‚Äôs also funny cause I went to three schools in my life (pre-K through eighth, hs, college) and we were taught the Bible at every one of them. It‚Äôs considered an important text and is in no way ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù from being taught but he‚Äôs way too dumb to know that.

@Noahpinion I believe in karma in that doing crazy shit catches up to you. If he's doing stuff like that to me, he's doing nutty stuff to other people and that never ends well. Anyway, he's worth no more of my mental energy. I'm excited to forget his name.
@Noahpinion Nah, I told him I didn't need to do anything else going forward because karma's an even bigger bitch than I am.
@Noahpinion Yep. And it's a lot because I don't list my clients here or talk about them here. This one was mentioned on LinkedIn (since removed) and he went there, then found out the owner then tracked him down. It's very creepy behavior.
@terrapinion @Mark_J_Perry @Noahpinion @kingharis nope, he's a liar and hypocrite to the core https://t.co/cVfXWG6CUJ
@IvanIlyich3 @dylanrahe @karlbykarlsmith @Noahpinion @Mark_J_Perry But he didn't lobby for that. He did zero research, he didn't ask them to do that he just filed the complaint.

@flawedgenius777 He's lionizing her "bravery"--showing her as the sane one standing up against unreasonable "purists." A fact would be "Amy Klobuchar doesn't support the green new deal or medicare for all." This is centrist fetishizing that cable pundits cannot ever stop.

@SeherSens Your argument has now morphed from "DNC rigging" to "centrist leaders are bad." I want a progressive to win the primary full stop. But is it possible you're unwilling to support a centrist Dem even if they are democratically chosen in the primaries? Cause that's a different story

@SeherSens Seher, it's not fear mongering when it's happening right now. You are talking in broad generalities. The DNC made a lot of changes after 2016 but they are not perfect. Are you really going to put so many at risk for something you can't even articulate?
@litbrit @mirandayaver @MSNBC Agreed, they did. I am not optimistic their coverage will be much better this time around in terms of focusing on real issues but I have not seen them crown anyone thus far.

A plea to my fellow Dems/liberals/lefties: Figt for your candidate as you will this cycle but please do not take it so far so that you cannot support whatever candidate becomes the nominee. Everything that has held together thus far will break if Trump is re-elected. Begging you!
@BenHowe @Pete2303 Look at this bonding! Next year a Ben and Pete buddy comedy. ;)
@Pete2303 @BenHowe I think this is right too. And going one step further Jesse Kelly‚Äôs thing last year.
@BenHowe @Pete2303 Yeah that‚Äôs probably true. But it‚Äôs also a chicken and egg thing: is it because the right breaks the rules more or the left reports it more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@Mikel_Jollett They‚Äôre really big towels and they‚Äôre delicious. They are amazing. Don‚Äôt let @yashar‚Äôs towel shaming stop you from trying them
@BenHowe @Pete2303 Do you mean collaborative like actually coordinating with other people to report or just reporting a lot and others doing the same?
@Pete2303 @BenHowe I think Ben is probably wrong about conservatives being more targeted by twitter if one controls for the offenses committed (hence my original tweet) but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs immovable on the subject or else I wouldn‚Äôt bother talking to him ;)
@Pete2303 @BenHowe That‚Äôs not my read of Ben. I disagree with him about a lot of things but he‚Äôs always shown himself to be intellectually honest and willing to call out the right.
@BenHowe I think it‚Äôs a location thing too. I lived in NYC for 35 and never had more than four towels even when I had live-in partners cause where the hell were we gonna put them?
@samstein I‚Äôm fairly sure he‚Äôs joking
@BenHowe Yep! I understand people‚Äôs frustrations with Twitter‚Äîthere policies are opaque and not evenly applied but that Quilette thing is such nonsense it‚Äôs incredibly irresponsible
@BenHowe I‚Äôd argue right wingers are 80x more likely to say shit like this https://t.co/FRkg76NUfb

@Advil We have six bath towels which works for us. Before I moved in recently my man had no wash clothes or smaller towels so I was honored to bring a few in. You really don‚Äôt need that many if you have easy access to a washer dryer.
@kimguilfoyle lol you‚Äôre lying as usually.
@QueenInYeIIow @ben_geier I‚Äôm not an SC expert but it was not a ‚Äúmanufactured‚Äù narrative that Sanders had problems winning black voters and winning over African-American activists, many of whom I hugely respect. I‚Äôm not attacking Bernie, I‚Äôm just saying he ignores this at his own peril. https://t.co/SPaVXLDfc6
@Freeyourmindkid Or an English speaker
@ben_geier I saw folks saying that it was an attack from corporate media (one example below) but it didn‚Äôt really read that way to me at least.

@epkaufm @RichardHanania You‚Äôre joking. This is a joke right? ‚ÄúRigorous study‚Äù?? It's just some guy listing a bunch of people who got suspended, not tracking why, then concluding that because people like David Duke and George Zimmerman were on the list, that's proof of anti-conservative discrimination.

@Mark_J_Perry @BlackGirlsCode So instead of working to get that program extended you‚Äôre taking opportunities away from young black girls to prove a point about male vicitmhood right? Because you‚Äôre a bad person.
So instead of lobbying Wayne State, a school you‚Äôre not affiliated with, to bring https://t.co/Km0xze3S48 on you decided to sue to keep @BlackGirlsCode out, which proves you don‚Äôt actually care about young black boys you‚Äôre just a terrible person. https://t.co/0vYPJRcxcs

lol there is no evidence in this piece.

@GeorgeShortez @blackha50711355 @StefanMolyneux READ A BOOK.

This is a very Trumpian response.

@AkilahObviously That is the correct answer.
@angstlos8 @ForeignPolicy I‚Äôm in no way excusing them. It‚Äôs bad.
No, I‚Äôm guessing many people on that staff have many different ideas of what the point of it was and some of them are probably annoyed that they had to do it all. It shows! (End)
There‚Äôs no single directive that explains this list and the headline ‚Äúglobal thinkers‚Äù means literally nothing. So what was the criteria? Most headlines? Maybe but then the energy folks wouldn‚Äôt make the list. Most powerful? Love Ronan Farrow but he‚Äôs not a PM or president. (4/)
And some are crazy, murderous despots. Time‚Äôs person of the year wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a compliment when it started‚Äîit was just supposed to be the person who made the most headlines (Hitler ‚Äúwon‚Äù it). Seems like some folks on staff though that was the directive here (3/)
This is something they‚Äôve done for a while. It probably didn‚Äôt have a clear mission statement to begin with and if it did it got watered down over the years. Some of it seems to be a typical ‚Äúhere are good people making a serious impact‚Äù which advertisers like... (2/)
