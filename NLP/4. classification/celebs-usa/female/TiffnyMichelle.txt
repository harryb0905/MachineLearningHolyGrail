@THEJoeDub @Stapes @gardenscasino I need names, dates, locations and quotations. You must have me confused with someone else, cuz I’m actively nice and cognizant is being kind to to 97% of humans I come in contact with 👍🏼

@Stapes @0Rl0N_ @PokerNightTV Yeah... apparently they’re super unhealthy! And clocks?!?? Banned from my home 🚫 I don’t even own a watch! Although let the record show that I was shot-clocking years before the shot clock even existed. #pioneer
@0Rl0N_ @PokerNightTV @Stapes Let’s hope that one thing we all did 10 years ago isn’t what we’re judged for the rest of our lives 😳 And I can confirm that my hosting style on a TV show is notably different than the agro way I opt to play poker against predominately male opponents for millions of dollars 👍🏼
Annnd this is where the Gardens #PokerNight set will go....  13-weeks of LIVE celebrity #poker action begins March 27th, every Tuesday on @CBSSports &amp; Wed-Fri I’ll host continued live stream programming from @GardensCasino. So yeah... I basically live  at a #casino now. Shocker! https://t.co/jTMVZ9Z9Gv
100% live!!! Zero prerecorded... anything can happen! ... which is why it’s super different than other poker programming and bringing something totally fresh to televised #poker. And after the live show, the action will continue on a live stream online on Twitch. https://t.co/2mrHTnEFgU

Rickie Fowler = Zac Efron long lost twin. #IdHitThat &lt;&lt; golf pun. #TheMasters2014 #RickieFowler #girlslikegolftoo
Did the commentator just refer to Justin Rose's stroke as "... just a 'gentle banana'"?? #TheMasters2014 #golfcommentary #PGATOUR
By a show of hands... should I live tweet #TheMasters2014 today? #PGATour #SundayFunday #golfnerd
This is not a #Coachella tweet.

Funny thinking about the women who find out they're ACTUALLY pregnant today &amp; tell their man, who just laugh like its a prank. #AprilFools
Am I the only person who doesn't like Pharrell's song "Happy"? It's annoyingly... uh... happy.
Just saw the #NoahMovie... the best part was the adorable baby animal montage at the end of the film.

Does anyone else giggle immaturely when #Instagram says "Finishing up" ?
Big congrats to my #poker wife @MariaHo on her 1st place, $100k win in the @WinStarWorld 5k event. She just keeps bringin' home the bacon!
@Jtillathekilla2 Lol. That's definitely more inconvenient &amp; problematic than my autocorrect! "Oooh you look nice." / "Pooh, you look nice."
Scary how well your #autocorrect gets to know you &amp; what it tells you about your common vocab. I type "Ooooo" &amp; it corrects to "Opponents."
@JoshMalina Sometimes I wanna "like" your tweet but "favorite" is my only option, so now I'm at a loss what to do. Lie or silence my liking?
Bye NYC. Bye @ZacharyLevi on Broadway. Bye @VanessaSelbst in wedded bliss. Back to LA to finish filming season 4 of @DeVanitysoap. Yay.

The sunset view right now from the Hollywood Hills. Wow. http://t.co/YvzEQXB0
Amused at how job descriptions try to spiff it up & sound more impressive. Isn't a "Coffee Host/Deli Team Member" just a "sandwich maker"?
Why isn't "NEITHER" an option in the gossip mags Who Wore It Better? Sometimes you can't make a potato sack look better than the next girl!
So great to see all my @AmazingRace_CBS family back up on the Emmy stage. Yay for Emmy #8! You guys deserve it! #AmazingRace
One of my Bucket List items is to go to the Emmy's in a cheap, nobody dress & when asked "Who are you wearing" say, "I got it at Ross!"
Pumpkin Spice Latte in hand. Fall can start now.
Checking out LA Food & Wine Events; amazing chefs/cuisines yet the one that catches my eye is "Grilled Cheese & Great Wines" :) I'm easy.
Tonight I wanted refer to Antonio Banderas & after saying "Antonio" the next thing that rolled off was "Esfandiari." Too immersed in poker?
Just found my theatre crush on FB from when I was 10, we were in Pinocchio. 17yrs later he's CUTE… & gay. Theatre crushes = don't work out.
Thanks! You'da you'da best :) RT @MatherPhotos Awesome Santa Monica photo shoot today w/ @TiffnyMichelle!! Check out: http://t.co/4hqAvxl
Had to bust out the ole pageant crown while getting ready for tonight's Miss Universe viewing party. http://t.co/QobvXQA
I wrote this awhile back & thought it was appropriate to share today: WE COULD UNDO http://t.co/2u9QLVv
Do any of the NYC Fashion Week designers have an amazing line of socks? If so, be on the look for @matrix31... he will be your #1 customer!
Thanks @BlakeLewis & all the amazing Idol alum for sharing your talent last night @ElevenNightclub. The world needs your voices. Rock on!
Trying to eat an In N Out double-double while driving on Muholland in nice clothes is proving to be more challenging than the Amazing Race.
One of the busiest travel weekends and I decide to do LA &gt; Oklahoma &gt; Dallas &gt; LA &gt; Mammoth in 72hrs. Go me!!!
Great day on the lake with @matrix31 - he caught the last tube of the day just as we caught the beautiful sunset! http://t.co/QTW90nr
Going "around the world" last night at WinStar with @matrix31 & @MariaHo... we were incognito obviously. http://t.co/MiJdoqi
Packing THREE suitcases right now: 1. My suitcase 2. Next week's camping suitcase 3. Everything Maria forgot suitcase. Yes you heard right.
Not sure which depresses me more: watching the news... or reality television.
Dear @KyleKaplan, please stop being so witty & funny. Its gonna look weird & kinda stalkery if I Favorite & retweet EVERY one of your posts.
...And more VMA after partyliciousness! http://t.co/6h4TKz1
Hahahaha. Yes please! RT @KyleKaplan Drake...im one of those so many people you didn't know last year. Should I open with that?
What a game! I luuuuv LA. http://t.co/Jr6hOVt
Seeing the grin on @TheRealMattKemp's face 2nite when he HR'd into the 30/30 club & standing with his family as they went CRAZY = priceless!
Gonna watch MK break some records tonight. http://t.co/ga3gSzt
So much for that "driving the speed limit" tweet... but seriously Mr Officer, 55 in a 40?! We don't have better things to do with our time?
Seems like it takes forever to get somewhere when driving the speed limit.
20hr day & its time for bed. Big thanks to the wonderful cast & crew of @DeVanitySeries for welcoming me into the fam today. All the best!
Who in the Hollywood Hills is BBQing right now??? I smell it and I want an invite to dinner!
Shooting a Guest Star on @DeVanityseries today. I don't even mind working on a Sunday when having this much fun!
Fav word of the day: Sniping. It sounds sneaky and is just fun to say!
Sad that @LouDPhillips has busted from the tourney... but not sad that he lost his underwear to @MariaHo in a last longer bet. Hee hee.
Just squeezed in some sit-ups... at 1am... on the porch... in my underwear... while waiting for my dog to pee. Make time to exercise people!
Not sure exactly what's going down in Hollywood tonight but THAT is a horse in the parking lot of the Roosevelt Hotel. http://t.co/EzqQvNa
I want a love story like in the movies: instantaneous,  perfect, forever... and with a soundtrack.
Cee & I celebrating the Dodger win on field with a gorgeous firework show! Happy Friday! http://t.co/5gi3Y88
Beautiful fluffy pink sunset here at Dodger Stadium. http://t.co/WY6pQeu
Dodger game. I've got the team spirit... even my tongue is blue! http://t.co/QYzYnal
It really is amazing how significantly a clean car improves my mood!
Takin my boo to the airport (aka @MariaHo). Not sure what she's gonna do on this trip without me around to carry her bags.
Apparently my watch dog is always on duty even during naptime :) http://t.co/O5U1SWP
Uhhh, so literally 5seconds after trying a "1-time" run good at the DMV... their entire system crashed. No joke. Guess I have my answer.
Wonder if I can use my "one time" "run good" powers at the DMV... bout to try it. ONE TIIIIMMMEEE!
Nobody has been home the last few days which leads me 2 believe that the  culprit who finished off this entire box of Vanilla Wafers was me.
Yep... she insists on sitting EXACTLY in the middle of where I'm doing laundry. http://t.co/mqwZVAn
Got blisters on my hands after a day of cleaning: dishes, laundry, dusting, sweeping... I'm clearly not cut out for this kind of hard labor.
I know about this whole "hands free" / no texting while driving... but what exactly is the law about doing my nails while driving?
Ohhh scalloped potatoes... you get me every time!
So happy to be home from Vegas & spending a SoCal Sunday here... instead of in the flaming desert. http://t.co/vqBw3gG
I just ate a cupcake for lunch. No one tell my mom, she would not be pleased.
I'm pretty sure @MariaHo's @BluffMagazine cover is the hottest BLUFF cover to date. She's got the Ho world in her hands! Couldn't resist :)
Just booked a role on the season 2 premiere of the new hit web soap @DeVanityseries. A naughty or nice role... you shall have to see! :)
Nothing brightens my day quite like a fresh, mom-made tuna sandwich!
Yep pretty much EVERYONE is at Comic-Con except me :( Gonna think of something really awesome to do this weekend to make THEM all jealous.
Oooh found a lovely treat to get me thru the basketball off season - Lie To Me. Lovin it, & who is this delightful @Brendan_Hines creature?!
Hmmm... maybe the insomnia is caused by the late night, totally pointless cyber browsing & the fact that I can't put my computer down.
I get a bit bored & restless during the basketball off season. Not sure what to do with myself. What does one watch on a week night?!?!
Gotta say... @espn3's online coverage of the @WSOP Main Event is looking good! Wish it had been around a few years ago.
Thanks to all who came tonight & helped raise money for Triumph Foundation/Spinal Cord Injuries. Nights like tonight make it all worthwhile.
The thing I miss most when spending the whole summer in Vegas... being right here. Good to be home. http://twitpic.com/5qbwue
Wow. I forgot what it's like to drive with the window down. God bless you Southern California. Home has never felt so good!
@matrix31 I want an ESPYs socks tweet!
Geesh, forgot how exhausting poker tournaments are! Put in a 12hr day, thankfully not in vain - made Day 2 of Caesars Mega Stack Main Event.
At a club in Vegas & @Jennicide's advice when I say I don't know how to dance to house music "Just move your legs & elbows." Thanks Jen :)
A good start to the week... http://twitpic.com/5orwg6
Ended up poolside at Hard Rock last night for a private Gavin Degraw performance. Good gig. Sweet jammin. http://twitpic.com/5of17g
Huge congrats and happy wedding day to a super sweetie pie who deserves a lifetime of love @Chikezie_Eze! Sending love to ya'll from Vegas.
All I know is that you're my new good luck charm! I'm taking you EVERYWHERE! RT @mannystreetz Hangin with @tiffnymichelle she knows cards!

4th of July weekend in Vegas... and I'm ready for a whole lotta THIS...  http://twitpic.com/5jc5wg
Can't imagine playing a poker tournament without my @skullcandy headphones. Got my white aviators today, love em.
Apologies 2 any women offput by my 08 heel click, just a personal victory. I actually like u, playing with u & think you're nice & pretty :)
I must say, it's nice to sit down a poker table full of women... every's hands & nails are so nicely manicured!
Would be interesting to have a "Whats in your bag" segment for poker players... today I have chicken tacos sitting in mine. Lol.
Can't wait for all my favorites to get to Vegas this weekend for some ridiculously HOT fun (literally).
Someone please explain http://yfrog.com/kgdbwcj - only thing inside is keypad with a red button next to it. Frightening. Very Lost-esque.
It's really not that difficult being a curtious driver. Let people in, give a wave of thanks when someone does something nice... try it!
Just heard a person spelling on the phone, using words to clarify the letter. I found "alibaba" to clarify the letter "A" an odd choice.
@ClintRobinson83 @don_83 Sending well wishes for a successful surgery & recovery!
Vegas is MUCH too hot... must..... escape...
@JasonMercier Another WSOP bracelet & I won't be able to handle your hotness factor. If so please don't look me in the eye henceforth ;) GL!
They may be Globetrotters but when they're in our hood they always stop & see us! Thanks @NikkiBeachVegas for the fun! http://t.co/pkeYM0a
... also, Spirit Air's planes are grungy & run down on the interior & the least amount of leg/in between seat space I've ever seen.
Traveler Tip: Don't fly Spirit Air! Cheap tix but extra charges 4 CARRY-ON, seat, suitcase (FYI 40lbs limit), drinks (even water) adds up!
Is it weird that I'm looking forward to landing at the Vegas airport so that I can have a pretzle???
Thanks Shawn Marion (@matrix31) for a great party yesterday & for letting @MariaHo & I win at the poker game ;) http://twitpic.com/5dsr7m
Note to self: Stop waking up before the sunrise.
2hrs of sleep in Dallas, then flight back to Vegas were the basketballer weekend continues as @MariaHo & I reunite with our Globetrotters!!
Nothin @danikadbagency can't get done! I ask for a drink, she brings me an entire bottle of champagne!
The only hotter place than Vegas right now is Dallas. @MariaHo & I partying in Mavs country with @matrix31! http://yfrog.com/h2hiqvtj
Even an LA girl can appreciate a great season by the Mavs & 1st franchise Championship. @MariaHo & I in Dallas to celebrate with @matrix31!
Video from the WSOP Kick-Off party at @NikkiBeachVegas this past weekend http://t.co/sEbJ5c1
Just landed in Dallas... and I can FEEL the Championship spirit in the air. It's just like being home! ;)
The Nevada DMV smells like popcorn... and isn't nearly as scary as I thought it might be. I just might spend the afternoon here!
6pm and I'm ready for bed. Vegas will do that to ya!
A huge freakin' CONGRATS to the Dallas Mavs... from me & @MariaHo :) Another  good excuse to celebrate! http://yfrog.com/kfkwgkj
Shots when: Marion @matrix31 dunks, Mavs lead @ the end of a quarter, when there is a T & when @mcuban cheers with both hands up. Who's in??
No poker today, @MariaHo & I are rooting on the Mavs & playing our favorite Playoffs/Shots game. Uh-oh. Shot, shot, shot, sha sha shots.
Sweating @Phil_Hellmuth at another WSOP final table, going for his 12th World Series of Poker bracelet. Go Philly! http://yfrog.com/gy866nej
Maria & def have the HOTTEST horse in the @WSOP 2pm Deepstack. We're bringing our Amazing Racing girl Meghan over to the poker darkside ;)
Dinnertime with @VanessaRousso @Mariaho, got our party shoes & dresses on & we're ready for @NikkiBeachVegas! http://yfrog.com/gz29382605j
Min-cashed and took 40ish something place in today's $550 Venetian Deepstack. Brutal bust out, AQ v. AQ & my opponent goes four to a flush.
Basking in the @MariaHo spirit has worked! My 1st tourney this summer & I'm in the money & down to 52players in the Venetian $550 Deepstack.
When you're a certified massage therapist you can give yourself your own backrubs at the poker table! It's actually kinda working right now.
I've been in Vegas for a week now & the last few days just basking in @MariaHo's greatness... maybe it's time I start playing some poker!
In case you hadn't heard, @MariaHo @VanessaRousso & I are hosting a fun WSOP party at @NikkiBeachvegas this weekend http://on.fb.me/mKSxOi
@runwicked @wickedbecool Thoughts and love to you guys and your families.
Having a mini final table celebration last night with the girls. The big bash will be this Friday @ Nikki Beach. http://twitpic.com/584vjx

Pretty crazy view from Azure pool at Palazzo, of Fashion Show Mall & The Wynn http://yfrog.com/h231555950j

Gearing up for @MariaHo @MariaHochips to bring me home a birthday win today in #wsop4. Playin 'All I Do is Win' 2 put her in the right mood.
At 2:49am the lights of Del Taco beckon me like an oasis in the dessert to a thirsty traveler.
Hmmm, maybe that @mcuban is onto something. How clutch are the Mavs right now?!
Ohhh that's right!!! I'm in Vegas... where the typical temperature outside at 7:00pm at night is 90-degrees. It's all coming back to me now.
Driving to Vegas with @MariaHo.. & by "with" I mean next to. 2 girl's Vegas summer closets can't fit in 1 car obv. http://yfrog.com/h62terwj
The sun burn on my face & body tells me I had a good holiday weekend -may not provide much fun for the week ahead, but ya can't win em all.
@AlexisBellino It hasn't even been a week and I miss you already! Come to Vegas soon for a little funness :)
Looking forward to playing @liveatthebike with the sexy Shaun Sipos, Nick Gonzalez, @MariaHo,  @JenEliseCox & more. Watch it live at 7:30
Gonna join a special "Maria Ho & friends" celeb cash game edition of LIVE AT THE BIKE tonight, you can watch live here http://bit.ly/92oTlm
Uhh, just got a birthday card in the mail from Southwest. Didn't know airlines send bday cards. Free flight woulda been much more exciting.
Dallas v. Oklahoma... giving me my basketball fix right now.
Eating my last slice of NYC pizza before heading back to LA. You know it's been a good trip when you've been MIA from Twitter & Facebook!
Nothing quite like Central Park just after a rain storm. http://yfrog.com/h2i7cdpj
I feel so grown up, spending a rainy NYC afternoon at The Met (@metmuseum)... my mom would be proud.
Out and about in NYC. Posted a pic +note on my tumblr page from one of today's finds - see it here... http://bit.ly/kyisP2
New York: So many pizza places... so little time.
On the E-Coast, taking a train today for the first time in my life... unless you count the trams at Disneyland. http://yfrog.com/gygzvrqj
Just saw a sign that said "Village Speed Limit 30MPH"... I did not know that villages have speed limits... or that New York has villages.
A side of New York you don't see very often. And If you look real close to the left of the red tree is a deer! http://twitpic.com/4wqo5l
Missed the Amazing Race 10yr reunion this weeknd, but season 15 had our own party at Meghan & Cheyne's wedding! http://yfrog.com/h4xxevdj
What 4:30am looks like http://yfrog.com/h2lbosjj
Never a good feeling when I have to set my alarm for an hour beginning with the number 4.
On days like today, with the cool breeze & sunshine its pretty impossible to get any work done from this couch.  http://twitpic.com/4vnrxh
What I was up to this weekend http://bit.ly/lBPhgq - Gorgeous couple, gorgeous ceremony. I gained some amazing friends from the #amazingrace
Dallas really brought it this round. If it can't be the Lakeshow going all the way, then I hope its the Mavs. G'luck @matrix31 & @mcuban.
Downtown San Diego, I love you. Be back soon. xox
Night 1 of Meghan & Cheyne's wedding weekend - with the FINEST men to have graced The Amazing Race. Fact. http://twitpic.com/4tynxv
Gonna really miss being at the Kentucky Derby this weekend but being in San Diego for an Amazing Race wedding will be priceless.
Never a boring photo shoot with @MatherPhotos - one of my fav photographers. We always do some fun stuff. Peek... http://twitpic.com/4t2f78
Did someone say 'Rummy'? How do I get in on THAT game? RT @PhelpsTheFish Glgl in rummy for all you guys tonight:) @Jgross5 @TheRealNicoleJ
You challenging me to a Pole-off? RT @MASEinthe place @TiffnyMichelle Yea stripper pole what wha! You can't come close to my skills tiff ;)
What she said &gt; RT @MariaHo LA girl & Laker fan but got love for @mcuban @matrix31 & that Mavs spirit! Looking forward to a great series!
Best post I've seen all day = RT @AmandaStratton The girl married her Prince. The bad guy is dead. It's a real Disney weekend here on Earth.
A "mini" huh? All I see is a stripper pole ;) RT @maseintheplace Yup thats a mini in a warehouse & my New place! http://plixi.com/p/97585437
Boo. Guess that means you're not comin' out for drinks tonight huh? RT @matrix31 City of Angels all work no play that's what's up.
Is it weird that when I don't have shoes on, I like driving like this? http://twitpic.com/4s52hl
Helena Bonham Carter is the man. That's all.
Lakers & Mavs round 2?!? Nooooo!!! Sigh. Clearly my top two favorite teams have to battle so soon. Will be exciting. There will be blood.
@BritWoodward Yep, today settles it... when I grow up I wanna be just like you. x2theO
Wow gorgeous day. 82-degrees in Hollywood, summer is knocking on the door & I fully intend on answering it in a bikini with a "Come on in!"
Is there something in the morning air (anything before 10am) that makes my eyeballs burn or just my body's way of saying I'm up too early?
Always cracks me up when I'm up too early that even my dog, who usually likes to pop up, run outside, go potty & play, won't get out of bed.
Clearly no one has told her Highness, Moxie that pillows are for people & not for her furry little puppy booty.  http://twitpic.com/4qfx8g
Dear NBA, I'm ready for the "where amazing happens" thingy right now with :33secs left in the Laker game. -Love, Tiffany.
People who chant "Kobe sucks" just look stupid or are in denial. Haven't they heard he's a gold medal Olympian, multi-MVP, 5time champ? Lol.
I've heard of Christmas miracles. Is there such a thing as an Easter miracle? Cuz I'm close to asking for 1 with this mess of a Laker game.
In movies when people rush to the airport, buy a ticket & chase down their lover, is that because BOTH their cell phones stopped working?
View from the Easter table http://yfrog.com/h7kzhqlj
"Jurassic Park" is one of the worldwide trends on Twitter right now? That's like, sooo 1993.
Happy holiday weekend to you all. Crack an egg over someone's head, eat a chocolate bunny, drink a mimosa and hug a family member. Be safe.
At UCLA today with friends for some wheelchair basketball. My first time playing, so this will be an experience! http://yfrog.com/h02lduaj
Good, bad, happy, sad, hard or easy, this life is a blessing and I can't help but be thankful for the air in my lungs and health in my body.
Remember when I tweeted: "Lakers playoff game... I feel like its Christmas"?! I now feel like I just got coal & used socks as a present.
Doesn't matter how many Fast & The Furious movies they pump out, they are my guilty pleasure. Even if each one is supposedly "The LAST job!"
Lakers first playoff game starts now... I feel like its Christmas!
...and Meghan's Vegas bachelorette weekend continues. Round 2,058,394 starts now & @MariaHo is feeling the love. http://twitpic.com/4lsib7
@PhelpsTheFish @TheRealNicoleJ Good seeing you guys today. Now, go getchyo tan on... and don't kill each other over the pokers! ;)

Yep, I just picked up some sick new gear from @Skullcrew & they straight up ICED me in the lobby. Props Skull Candy... you got me THIS time.
Other reasons I love Vegas... walked into @ScarpettaLV for dinner and the chef himself greets us. For the record, Scott Conant is a cutie!
Tonight at Tryst with @MariaHo & our gorgeous bride-to-be, Meghan 4 her Vegas bachelorette weekend extravaganza! http://twitpic.com/4l1mw1
Reasons I stay at @Cosmopolitan_LV - they welcome me at check-in with a Mimosa!
Good luck to @VanessaSelbst, down to 12 player & crushing the NAPT Mohegan Sun right now! I still wanna be you when I grow up.
Never a dry eye when I'm watching ABC's Secret Millionaire (@ABC_SM). What a special and powerful show. Great TV programming, ABC. Kudos.
Is it pathetic that I'm mainly disappointed about losing my wallet because I had a punch card with two free Aunt Anne's Pretzels in it?!
5 ejections, 3 technical fouls... the Lakeshow looked more like a hockey game tonight! Kinda fun.
@phil_hellmuth Happy Anniversary Philly! You & your wife make a great couple & its inspiring to see that you 2 have put in such a long run!
After a long days work, Vegas calls... and we said "Yes please!" http://yfrog.com/h8sk5wjj
Its not every day you walk down the world famous Freemont Street for work.... in a non-hooker kind of way ;)
35-degrees in Colorado. Not cool... literally... more like FREEZING.
I love getting the chance to meet deaf poker players at events & refresh my sign language days. So special for me.
Huge thanks to everyone at @NewBelgium Brewery for the rock star tour today. Coolest staff ever! We're fans :) http://yfrog.com/gyjclavj
Had NO CLUE how freakin cool @FirstLadyPoker & @Jan_Fisher were! Love seeing female legends of the game who are totally badass & hilarious!
So touched by how supportive this entire county is of Realities For Children. Amazing to see everyone pull together & give so unselfishly.
By the way this whole weekend that I'm apart of is to raise funds 4 Realities For Children, doing amazing work in CO ! http://bit.ly/fUVslZ

The most awesome bottle of wine I saw at Vintages/Your Personal Winery, where people make & bottle their own wine http://yfrog.com/gyqowsj
Fort Collins clearly wants to get me drunk today: Noon wine tasting, 2pm beer tasting & tour at New  Belgium Brewing... all before lunch!!!

A friend took this pic & I borrowed. Uhh, I feel a little uncomfortable about this yet I think its fairly awesome! http://twitpic.com/4c6a2t
Random 1:00am thought: Man, its been a hot second since I've enjoyed a drink & storytime with @bobguiney... I'm definitely overdue.
Lol'd at this RT @NellSco What if the #Supermoon is just an ordinary moon with a GREAT publicist?
Shout-out 2 my friends Kevin & Alvin who may not be able to run but will rock the LA Marathon tomorrow on their hand bikes! Proud of u guys!
Just realized that I have not tweeted in THREE days! That cannot be good for my health!

Never underestimate the power of a kind, friendly & helpful sales associate. Norman at Samy's Camera LA made my day yesterday! Thank you!
Thanks @WickedChops for the shout-out/write up on your site about this past week's charity tourney. http://bit.ly/eMkK6x Always hilarious.
Totally KNACKERED! ...and in case any of you don't speak British... that's NOT necessarily a good thing.
Recovering from too much Vegas fun & going through pics from last night, like this one with Miz @nataliegetz. http://twitpic.com/469e04
Thank you, sweet friend :) RT @TrishelleC Only @TiffnyMichelle can host an event & make the final table of it. She does it all!!

Any day that I HAVE to set my alarm for 11:00am... is a GOOOOD day.
Road trip from LA with @MariaHo @TrishelleC & @JeffMadsenObv was a fun, hilarious & ticket free! Helloooo Las Vegas.
In other news... more talk show hosts should be Oscar presenters.
My favorite part of the Oscars... @ZacharyLevi singing "I See The Light". So proud of that boy. Such a beautiful, talented soul.
@MARLONLWAYANS In other news... are you coming to Vegas on Thursday? I'm pretty sure we've got some lingering poker score to settle.
Clearly I was disillusioned about today's weather as I step out in leggings only to realize it's 40-degrees outside.... NOT legging weather.
Clearly I've been staring at my computer too long today... I didn't even notice that its raining outside.
Never met @DaveLGood but the fact that he's talkin smack about takin my $ at the tables next week in Vegas tells me we're gonna get along!
Big thanks to the @WorldPokerTour for throwing a great event last night - here is @MariaHo & I on the red carpet http://twitpic.com/422212
Why do I ever leave the house when I can watch endless television programming like "My Strange Addictions: I Eat Couch Cushions". No joke.
Thats sounds reasonable! RT @ShannaMoakler Mr Jerry Buss is at my table... I feel if I get all his chips he should give me the lakers !
Who says girls don't play poker?!?!  Got my favorite blondes here @TrishelleC & @ShannaMoakler http://yfrog.com/hs4b1bdj
Alright let's get some boys in there. Love me some Jerry Buss & Scotty Nguyen, two of the sweetest guys I know! http://yfrog.com/h4k0xwfj

You know you're having a good time when you go for hours, completely oblivious to Twitter, Facebook, your cell phone, electronic devices...
This is literally where my dog sits when I drive. http://yfrog.com/hst65xj
Just saw a play that covers: rape, suicide, masturbation, abortion, homosexuality, & child abuse. You know, one of those feel good musicals!

Frozen face parts, that can only mean one thing... I must be on the East Coast!
I think I want to change my last name to "Chancellor". It sounds very regal & powerful & has the word 'chance' in it. It feels appropriate.
Wicked Chops red carpet interview from @HPTPokerTour's kick off in Las Vegas, dishing on what I have coming up in 2011 http://bit.ly/dKAkIe
Hit a bit of a lull in the HPT tourney but Whitney, Britney, Kanye & My Chemical Romance are pullin me through it. Wow, what an odd combo!
Listen I'm a very logical person but I'm also pretty sure that Mimosa O'Clock provides me with magical powers @ the poker table. Just sayin.
It noon in Las Vegas... according to MY watch that means it's Mimosa O'Clock. @HPTPokerTour who's with me???
Good morning Las Vegas!!! Playing my 1st live tournament of 2011 - The @HPTPokerTour's season 7 kick off main event. Happy thoughts!

Started the day with supporting a great cause, now 2 final tables & 3 cashes later I'm feelin' the poker karma! And the night isn't over!
Apparently the holidays are over and now I actually have to start thinking about being productive and getting back to work.
Overheard "All I know is I woke up this morning in bed next 2 Larry & thought WOAH what am I doing in bed next 2 Larry?!" Oh Sat mornings!
I bring you this important message: @stevevalentine is THE best dinner guest one could ask for. His card/magic tricks blow my mind!!!
Southern California is seeing snow right now while THIS is my view http://yfrog.com/h6bi3ej
Must be a slow news day when the web headlines are about a celebrity "debuting a new hair style." Isn't it just called getting a hair cut?!
Golfing in Maui. I couldn't ask for a more peaceful & gorgeous way to ring in the New Year. http://yfrog.com/h03aybj

Not sure if I was more excited today for Christmas or the Lakers vs Heat game..... happening NOW!
Someone fits right in with the Christmas festivities. Just put a bow on her and call her my furry little present! http://twitpic.com/3jkybd
About to sneak into my parent's house... hopefully no one mistakes me for Santa, although I would not turn down milk & cookies if offered!
They're either looking for Santa or trying to figure out how to light the GAS fireplace... http://yfrog.com/h0pg6uj
Just saw someone on the freeway with a Christmas tree on their car roof... talk about a last minute purchase!
In case I go MIA over the next two days from Eggnog, Christmas carols & present coma... MERRY CHRISTMAS everyone! http://twitpic.com/3ivcfd
Dear Santa, I just saw the Lakers schedule... wow, you work fast. THANKS! Love, Tiffany.
Dear Santa, for Christmas I'd like to watch an awesome basketball game... with the Lakers playing the Heat. Thanks. Love, Tiffany.

Well THAT has to be a first! Airport security just said to me "Ma'am, I'm gonna have to measure your screw driver." Then we both chuckled.
Ted Lawson & Vanessa Rousso both gave me good reason to fly to Vegas. Sweating the WPT Five Diamond final table http://yfrog.com/h375711109j
LA is home but I woke up this morn in a San Diego hotel to Maria walking out saying "Bye! See you later today in Vegas." Our life is funny.
Well, at least ONE of us final tabled the charity poker event tonight. The big Cheyne W. did us proud with his FT! http://twitpic.com/3e0w7i
Tournaments where a player (honestly) takes the dealer button & puts it in his chip stack when a pot is shoved to him is PLUS EV for me!!!
How 9-10 is &gt; than K9 & A9, I don't know. But I wanna keep playing at this table for FOREVER!!!
Racing, pokering... we love doing ANYTHING together. Tonight we're at the tables raising money for @Road2Recovery. http://yfrog.com/h4kk8j
You know you've reached adulthood when you don't know how many days it is till Christmas.
Puttin' my big boy pants on today! Gonna get down and dirty with the moto boys; dirt bikes, race tracks, poker... Yum!

You know you're in a huge airport when....... there is a 'K' gate.
Travel day from hell has redeemed itself & turned into a mini Amazing Race Reunion in Chicago with our Sammy! http://yfrog.com/128u9lj
You'd think a place called "Boy's Town" is for the ladies, right?! It's not :( The odds are NOT in my favor in this part of Chicago.
Travel day from hell: Cancelled flight &gt; became new 3hr delayed flight &gt; became cancelled flight &gt; turns into 4.5hr road trip with @MariaHo
http://yfrog.com/ehmyaxj Ice cream and wine at 11pm at night?!?! Odd combo @MariaHo, but I won't stop you!!!
Bubbled the HPT's Championship TV final table, not much wiggle room with everyone's stack at 8-10 big blinds. Happy with 7th out of 413 tho.
HOLY COW! Three final tables in a week! And I haven't even been wearing my lucky underwear! ;) HPT Champs 9handed, not a lotta chips.
14 players left in the HPT Champs. The blinds are going up fast. I have 620k chips with 10,000/20,000 blinds +2k ante.
In the money and down to 28 players in the @HPTPokerTour Championship Event.
It's 5:40am PST (my time) & I have to get up & play a poker tournament. Pretty sure I've never done this before. Not sure brain is working.

Made the final table of the HPT's Charity Poker tournament and took 5th. Hopefully I'll keep this run going into tomorrow's Main Event!
You know you're not in LA or Vegas anymore when..... The driver picking you up from the airport mentions that it's "deer season."
Each time I step off an airplane & DON'T have to go running, I am happy. Being able to casually stroll through an airport is a treat!
Anyone in the Mt. Pleasant Michigan area 2morrow, come join us @ Soaring Eagle Casino for the HPT's Celeb charity event http://bit.ly/d990BI
Took 6th place. Can't complain at 2 final tables in one week. Lets keep the good runnin' going this week at the Heartland Poker Tour Champs!
8 handed now, still short stacked. @jeffmadsenobv told me to think positive... so I am. I wonder how many chips thinking positive is worth.
Yes... go us! ;) RT @JeffMadsenobv @TiffnyMichelle And me at next door final tables.. Go us
Had a nice little, 2pm table side casino breakfast with @devopoker now I'm ready to play the NAPT 1k final table, starting 8th in chips.
Home court advantage seems to be working for me here at the NAPT in LA. Made my 2nd final table, in the 1k NL event! Play resumes tomorrow.
We really do everything together! @MariaHo & I are down to the last two tables in NAPT side events. Her in the 1k HORSE & me in the 1k NL.
Playing the NAPT $1k side event today. Got a perfect view of @JasonMercier's chip towers (in the Main) & will use them as inspiration.
Thanks for the love! Took 8th after an insanely uneventful & card dead final table. But it's always nice getting there & having a shot :)
Been so card dead, then got all in with 9s v. K- 10, hit my set then board goes 4 to a straight flush for the other chick. Short now, 7left.
Chip leader going into the NAPT Ladies final table. Haven't played this many consecutive hours of poker in a long time. Man, I'm exhausted.

The classiest dinner @MariaHo & I have ever eaten... http://yfrog.com/g9k0cpj
Listening to Maria's & my music gig recording from last night, @Chikezie_Eze & Ryan Eggold's guest performances are KILLIN' me. So talented.

Been entertained all day by the @WSOPstream. Super interesting even with no holecams. It's 1am but Philly, Gav & James are keeping me awake.
Cracking up and enjoying @JonAguiar's Main Event final table commentary and terminology on @WSOPstream (on ESPN3.com)
Watching the @WSOPstream. Sweating The Grinder. God, I love this game! Poker is such an amazing & brutal lover. Always a roller coaster!
Maria went to South Africa & all she brought me back was this Silly Band http://yfrog.com/n2blzkaj Was hoping 4 a baby giraffe at the least.
Dear Scarves patiently hanging in my closet: I'm sorry. Maybe we can hang out next year.
Finally got around to watching Robin Hood. Somehow @ScottGrimes made archery look sexy.

Sending all my happy and lucky vibes to @TheGrinder44 and family at the WSOP Main Event final table in Las Vegas this weekend. Do work, kid!

Alright people the fun & games are over. Wipe that chocolate from your face, peel off those fishnets, put some clothes on & get back 2 work!
@KimberlyLansing Taco didn't happen this year. She put on her football jersey & called it a night! It was just one of those Halloweens ;)
Genius! RT @joeldavidmoore With a lack of candy we've moved 2 trick or trade. To get something they give us 1 of their less favored candy.

Ooooo, so fun turning on my TV and having @sarahjoybrown's pretty face pop up on my screen! :)
I have underestimated how hard core metal fans are. Me & the blond stick out like a sore thumb. Looking forward 2 watching @Scott_Ian shred!
Loving the comments on what to wear to the metal concert. My favs: "body armor" "earplugs" "ask @liv_boeree" "nothing" "blood stained shirt"
Hmm, what exactly does one wear to a Megadeath/Slayer/Anthrax concert???
An interview I did with @FashionNewsLive TV in March at Brand Equity Showroom's Fall Runway Show during LA Fashion Week http://bit.ly/bpQy1Q

Grabbed this picture from @sarahjoybrown... **DO NOT want to live here! http://twitpic.com/2zk6pn

An evening snuggled up on the couch for Monday Night Football sounds just about perfect for a rainy day! Where's the hot chocolate?!
Looks like I'm gonna have to put some thought into what I wear 2day, my go-to flip flops, shorts & tank won't do. Where'd I put my sweaters?

You know you're in Jersey when... http://yfrog.com/n87hjdj ... you see men sportin' a muscle T!
Good morning @BorgataPoker! Thanks for the tasty dinner & great sleep... now let's play some cards!
Reunited & it feels so goood. I just can't live without @MariaHo! http://twitpic.com/2o6s69
In my opinion, its unhealthy to wake up & start your day when it looks like this outside...  http://yfrog.com/fvkh7j NOT COOL 5AM, not cool.
Setting my alarm for 5am makes me cranky..... and it's not even 5am yet!
Thankful today... for life, for freedom, for the promise of tomorrow & the adventures that await, and for friends & family to share it with.
Enjoying an amazing dinner last night at Searsucker in downtown San Diego with the Amazing Race family. http://twitpic.com/2n5qlc
My little slice of heaven... http://yfrog.com/b5yjnj
Date Night... with the Asian and two blonds. I'mma lucky girl!
Yep, sounds about right... get my car washed and 30min later it starts sprinkling.
Hope everyone enjoys Labor Day! PLEASE remember to be safe... call a cab, ride with a friend, don't ruin the fun with any accidents!
Just heard a funny quote, "We're gonna do it MY way... there is no highway option!"
Pumpkin Spice Lattes are back at Starbucks... best news I've heard all day!!!
Another day, another dollar, another crack at  The River $3,000,000 guarantee poker tourney.
Always good times with @MariaHo. Sending love from WinStar Casino, thanks for everything! http://twitpic.com/2l1i5j
You know you're in Oklahoma when: You can get a bottle of wine for $22.00... & when a grasshopper hits you in the face, right @MariaHo?!
Seriously?!? Out of everyone playing The River tourney in Oklahoma  THIS is my table draw?! In this order too! http://yfrog.com/n1tiiqj
I am in a town called Thackerville. It sounds like a place from a movie but it's actually in Oklahoma. "Thackerville", it's just fun to say!
Helllooooo Dallas, nice to see you again! Didn't think I'd be back so soon but how can I help it when y'all are so dang nice?!?!
Totally stoked about the unclaimed Yoshi slippers that I just stole from the guest room closet! http://twitpic.com/2kgdks
Should be prepping for a callback tomorrow but procrastinating instead, watching @jenelisecox's reel. I love her, she so funny!
http://yfrog.com/6cn1wgj My weirdo dog does this all the time. She loves to crawl on my lap & burrow under my computer!
I could listen to @KChenoweth singing pretty much any day, all day.
@matrix31 Welcome home! We missed your twitterliciousness. BTW Ho & I will be in your backyard this weekend... stalking you obviously.
RT @davidalangrier @TiffnyMichelle I miss u !! &lt;-- Stay in town for more than 2 seconds & we can nerd out & watch cooking shows together! :)
Well helllooo Texas/Oklahoma. Ho-Chips is gettin ready to riiide again! @MariaHo & I are comin' back for more. Round Two, ding ding ding.
The weather in So.Cal today is perfect for my agenda: Online poker, watching movies, snuggling on the couch with the pup and sipping wine.
Spent the evening in Wonderland w/ @sarahjoybrown, wondering if she's back 2 her normal size yet. Shame we didn't get a round of croquet in.
Just watched "The Other Guys" and realized that the Wayans family basically runs the world.
At Fox 4 audition & I'm the only girl in a room of gorgeous black men. Clearly we were not here 4 same role & cleary I don't mind the view!
At a dueling piano bar with  girlfriends. They start playing, blond girlfriend says "Oh my god... there's 2 guys playing at the same time."
Just discovered the best drink invention ever!!!! Hello, Frozen Mojito... I love you. Let's makeout!
Loved the Viva Elvis sets, costumes & performances. This flag is from an Army scene, its long johns & t-shirts! http://twitpic.com/2i3pgj
I mean... how could @MariaHo and I pass up the opportunity to snap a pic with our favorite slot machine?!?! http://twitpic.com/2hz36x
@matrix31 USA misses you :(
Time for a dance break??? I think so!!!
Um @MariaHo, where did your drink go? That looks like a 16 ouncer & the show was only an hour long! http://twitpic.com/2hxmzz
Found time 2 see a Vegas show which we never get 2 do, Viva Las Vegas. @MariaHo just realized something I've known 4 awhile, Elvis was hot!
Being in the back of a cab with @MariaHo always gives me Amazing Race flashbacks, but today I'm less stressed & the cabbie speaks English!
Vegas called... @MariaHo & I packing our bags for a last min meeting & some pre-Emmy festivities, lets make it 8 in a row for Amazing Race!
Two @UB final tables at the same time??!?! Yes, please... that's a good day's work! Thanks all who stopped by and wished me luck today!
Today's closet/cleaning discovery: I have A LOT of sweaters and an unnecessary amount of Laker attire.
Deep run in a #UBOC event = $0.00 / Losing JJ v. AJ = However much Advil costs (for the pain) / Playing with rock stars on UB = Priceless.
I loathe using my car horn, but when I must it's nice having a loud 1. Nothing worse than trying to make a point with a sissy sounding beep.
@BrianPeeler Yesssssssss!!! Love it!
No matter how many times I've watched, Will Ferrell movies make me laugh out loud... even by myself.
@mcuban You're so much taller than I thought. There... just didn't wanna be out of the loop. :)
Ha ha. Wish I was keepin' you company :) RT @SammyRyRy Enjoying a Lemon Drop Martini somewhere somehow but with no 1. Thanx @tiffnymichelle

Check out the StarCraft v. Poker Pros feature I shot @ KTLA the other day. http://bit.ly/csKqAT Fun times, thanx @cyberguy & @DarwynsTheory
Driving by the Staples Center... having major NBA withdrawls. My life is so dim in the off season. LOL.
T-minus... not enough hours till my flight to Wales. Maybe I should consider packing.
http://yfrog.com/2tnyofwj The truck says, "Royal Flush"... something tells me these guys have nothing to do with poker!
http://twitvid.com/WP3XU - This is just too funny not to share. My horny dog does this EVERY night (only at night) to HER favorite bear.
I feel kind of guilty setting my alarm for 10:00am.
I need to win the 1st #UBOC event, kicking off in 30min in order 2 pay for all the audiobooks I just bought on iTunes. I went a little nuts.
http://twitvid.com/JDAEJ - Maria Ho & I at KTLA, ready to get our video game on & get massacred by the Starcraft guys.
At KTLA studio this afternoon playing Starcraft & poker with Blizzard Entertainment CEO Mike Morhaime & pals. http://twitpic.com/2fsdjz
About to super nerd out right now at KTLA with some Starcraft players & get my video game on... not nervous AT ALL!!!

I knew I was strangely attracted to u 4 some reason ;-) RT @ShannaMoakler @TiffnyMichelle welcome to my world!! I have 100000 fsas hoodies!

THAT&#039;S a good Sunday! http://twitpic.com/2atuap
Just discovered the all-time greatest place to spend Poker Sunday; @TrishelleC's house! She provides coffee, Happy Meals, snacks & brownies!
Rediscovering 1 of my fav TV shows ever: Pushing Daisies. What a beautiful & brilliant production with such talent, much too short lived.
Stoked about the couch day that I have ahead of me, accompanied by X-Games on TV.
Yep, I just lost the game Catch Phrase because of this word! I&#039;m so out of my mind at this game right now. http://twitpic.com/2aacq8

Gotta hand it to him, Adam Lambert puts in a great show! @alisanporter's song 'Aftermath' was, hands down my favorite of the set.
@alisanporter ...I just caught Orianthi's pick! &lt;-- Of course ya did cuz you're a ROCK STAR & those kind of things gravitate toward you obv.
Good to be home. Getting some much needed recovering from Vegas... I did it good and hard this week, and my voice is thrashed to prove it.

Loved being apart of the Executive Monkeys show @ Palms. Be sure to check it out Vegas, Wednesday nights at 9pm. Funny stuff, talented cast.
Enjoying a perfect Vegas night, 55 floors up @ Moon with @TrishelleC http://twitpic.com/27hu5e

http://yfrog.com/n7x87j Yep that's @TrishelleC as we're about 2 board, sitting on her suitcase cuz that's the only way it'll close. Cute T.
How has @TrishelleC not tweeted about her near felony arrest @ the airport this morning?! Never a dull moment. We're finally Vegas bound!
Random thought of the day: I'm really glad Eminem is back... loving all his new stuff.
http://yfrog.com/n69cwj Is that an unhealthy amount of pillows to sleep with? I think I just counted 12.
Southern California summers... can't beat 'em. Beautiful day in Santa Monica today. http://yfrog.com/n4tusqj

Having a little fun with the girls at Oakley's MLB All-Stars party tonight! http://twitpic.com/24wa37
I've somehow ended up on @Oakley's party bus. This will be interesting. http://yfrog.com/58m6eqj
First up... Oakley's party. This is their headquarters & I feel like I'm entering the batcave. Cool. http://yfrog.com/2olqpkj
Dragged my booty out of the house for MLB All-Star festivities. It's 11:10pm and the night hasn't even started. Oh boy, here we go...
Who says stuff like this?! Lol I love her. RT @MariaHo Day 3 of the WSOP & feeling optimistic & confident in my short stack ninja abilities!
Doesn't matter how many times I've seen them, I never get tired of watching James Bond or Batman movies! And today it's *all of the above!
LOL I'M jealous of your 176,600 chips. If ya keep at it you can enjoy a nice drive home too, millions of $$ richer! RT @AnnieDuke Jealous!
http://yfrog.com/3uxn4cj Adios Las Vegas! Thanks for great summer. Now I shall drive off into the horizon, in search of the next adventure.
...And that's it for me. Fought like a champ my entire tourney. Lost what little chips I had left with AJ v. 56. Had a fun 2010 WSOP!
The WSOP Main Event can never let me just coast huh?! Up & down all day, always a fight. Got my chips back, 69k now & 92 guy apologized :-)
Ugly. Lost 1/2 my stack (down to 34k) with AK (top 2), guys raises pre then bets every street with 92 & makes a flush on river. Good poker.
@EmilyJillette You smart... AND pretty!
So excited that I actually, legitimately found a random guy, who I don't even know for today's #WSOPHotGuyAlert http://yfrog.com/eudoqj
The double up came! Got 77 in verses AA and flopped my set of 7s. Have some breathing room now with 30,400 (@mychipcount).
Good morning World Series of Poker Day 2. Let's see if we can work this stack up & make it a long day!
Another Emmy nomination for @Amazing_RaceCBS for 'Outstanding Reality Competition Program'. It's well deserved. Congrats to my AR family!
@druidDUDE Congrats on all the Emmy noms!!! Pretty crazy how life turns out huh?! So happy for you and all your success xx
My fav WSOP updates 2day have come from @AnnieDuke -1st break still in -2nd break still in -Last break still in. Ha ha, short & 2 the point!
Love that @Jennicide is back on the poker scene and giving the boys a run for their money in the WSOP Main Event. I've missed that girl!
Pool, pedi's & massages today with the girls. Maximizing the relaxation factor during my 3 days off before returning to the Rio for Day 2.
Forgot all about this one until I passed him @ the Rio today. #WSOPHotGuyAlert is back & paging Nick Schulman!!! http://yfrog.com/jbfrpyj
@twi_poker @wickedchops Fun times today on This Week In Poker, always love chatting with you guys.
Watch @MariaHo & I today at 4pm on This Week In Poker here http://bit.ly/90zDB7 - We'll be live & available for your questions!
Video interview up on @ESPN_POKER, recapping my Day 1 of the WSOP yesterday http://es.pn/buRmrP
Now that he's made it thru Day 1 of the WSOP Main Event I can brag that @DavidAlanGrier is my poker prodigy lol. Watch out @MARLONLWAYANS!!!
Well, there was no crazy double ups OR busting. Made Day 2 of the WSOP Main Event & will be coming back on Friday with about 20big blinds.
I keep thinking that good cards HAVE 2 come. Playing 10hrs & I've had Aces twice, jacks, 8s, AK AQ & AJ once.  Not exaggerating. That's it.
If @MariaHo weren't so greedy she'd totally help a sister out & throw me just a single tower from the Great Wall of China she's building.
Loving another new pair of my @SkullCandy headphones http://tweetphoto.com/31052180 ...love having option when it comes to designs.
My table draw: got a Swede on my left & an Asian/Finnish/Canadian on my right... & I'm the poor little American girl sandwiches in between!
Who says she doesnt carry our team?! ;-) RT @ESPNInsideDeal Amazing Race Update. @MariaHo cruising with 60K @TiffnyMichelle fighting early.
Getting railed by @SammyRyRy is never a bad day!!! ;-) http://yfrog.com/9fnj4qj
Listen ESPN cameras: Stop hoarding around my table like I'm a lamb being led to the slaughter, not giving you an exciting bust anytime soon!
Ahh, nothing like a little Welcome To The Black Parade for much needed pick-me-up at the poker table!
So... things are basically going the same way as the early days of my 2008 WSOP, short stack: grind grind grind. Let's hope this is an omen.
@BTNFLY Thanks Jimmy... always appreciate your support :-) Wish you were playing with us!
Good morning WSOP Main Event! Aces count of the day = 1 for 1, altho they weren't worth much but as long as they keep holding I'm A-ok.
Alright, bedtime for me. Playing Day 1a of the WSOP Main Event tomorrow... lets see if I remember how to do this! ;-)
What better way to spend the 4th than in the pool with your girlfriends?! http://twitpic.com/22k91j

http://yfrog.com/417foj Wearing the new cuff I got at the Emmy gifting suite from hthandicrafts.org, a wonderful non-profit organization.
TMI post of the day: Bad idea wearing shorts 2 play in today, my butt/legs are sticking to the chair making it difficult to maneuver around.
Down to 1400 chips in the WSOP $1k tourney. @MariaHo just told me to rally & then Christina Aguilera's Fighter came on my iPod ha ha. Ok.
Just ran kings into... umm 5/7?! If this doesn't work out I plan on going back to the PH Suite & getting chocolate wasted @ the candy table.

RT @sarahjoybrown Just landed in Vegas w/ @TiffnyMichelle going 2 lunch with the beautiful ladies nominated for Lead Actress, Cheers!
The hottness factor at the Burbank Airport has significantly increased today... Daytime's sexiest stars are off to Vegas for the Emmys. WEE!
I have found a way to exercise on my Elliptical while playing online poker at the same time. My bum is very excited about this discovery.
Looks like a pretty good Thursday night to me! http://twitpic.com/1zq8lg
Getting soooo excited for the Daytime Emmy festivities this weekend in LAS VEGAS! Can't wait for my hot date @sarahjoybrown to get here!
In other news: I'm wearing my @SkullCandy special edition Snoop Dogg Skullcrusher headphones today.... my fav headphone ever!
Um YESSSSS! Can't wait. GO TEAM BROWN! RT @sarajoybrown Is it just me or is it time 2 get excited for the Emmy's n Vegas this weekend?
When you're a girl poker player (@TrishelleC) stuff like this happens to you when you're shortstacked on break http://yfrog.com/3o21122288j
Can you tell by my amount of tweets today that I'm sitting at a poker table, playing a tourney... bored?!?!
Apparently the bar was set too high with my #WSOPHotGuyAlert when I named @JasonMercier cuz I've been on a serious candidate drought since.
@TrishelleC Ha ha. BTW, who needs a WSOP bracelet??? Let's find out what we can get for a 1st place win at the Venetian Deepstack tourney!
Not @ Rio 2day, so no #WSOPHotGuyAlert. Something tells me there won't be complaints with this bday pic instead. http://twitpic.com/1ykel3
Definitely my new favorite club, so purty & spacious. Fav cake ever too! RT @Eve_NightclubLV Happy Birthday Tiffany http://yfrog.com/j1p41cj
Off the hook at @Eve_NightclubLV. Best bday ever, not to mention the SICKEST cake. http://twitpic.com/1y1ylu

LA wins! Now I've got even more to celebrate at my birthday party tomorrow night at @Eve_NightclubLV! Come out and join the fun.
Who needs a WSOP bracelet when ya gotta NBA Champs ring?!?! Well, not me personally but my hometown & I'm sure Jerry will let me hold his :)
I luuuuuv LA.
My Lakers halftime show was @jeffmadsenobv doing poker impersonations. He does the BEST Tom Dwan that u have ever heard! I was in stitches.
Loved shooting at @evenightclublv today. What a sexy venue for a photo shoot! Can't wait for my bday bash there tomorrow night.
Think I'll save my money, not play another WSOP event till the Main & just live vicariously through @MariaHo... girl is makin' me proud!
Out of the $1500 NL. King-high flush no good. At least I'm not wasting entire days grinding it out at the Rio all for naught.
Alright, enough time off. Time to remember why I'm in Vegas for the summer. It's back 2 the Rio tomorrow for a little WSOP $1500 NL Hold'Em!
Winning in Vegas and I didn't even have to leave the house! Just won the 7k GTD on UB! Now if only I can run that good in a WSOP event.
How have I not run out of Laker's clothes to wear yet?! It's getting to be slim pickins though... they'd better lock this up soon!
Best & most thorough written article I've read regarding the WSOP Ladies Event. Props @taopauly (a man) for his insight http://bit.ly/dbhdXr
http://yfrog.com/7gxplj You can't totally tell but the Vegas sky is really pretty right now with the evening sun peeking thru the clouds.
No seriously... either @MariaHo, @JenEliseCox or @Liv_Boeree are winning me a WSOP Ladies Event bracelet today as a belated bday present!
Yes... I like red!!! http://yfrog.com/hqdribj RT @Jarebx Anyone like red? http://tweetphoto.com/26920546
...& yes, that is what I was thinking as I exited the Rio a moment ago from the 1k event after busting in the 1st level with a set of jacks.
A man's thought bubble when busting early from a poker tourney "@&$#"... A woman's "Wow, THAT was a waste of a hair & makeup job!"
So many of my gorgeous girlfriends still in the Ladies Event 2day but not me. So I shall divide & attempt to conquer the $1k NL Event today!
@JeffMadsenObv You look so young in your POY pic from 2006 hanging @ the Rio.... I've decided to renickname you Jeff Baby Bird Madsen.
@MariaHo ...no seriously, there are BARELY any popsicles left!
Now I remember why I don't mind busting the 1st level of a tourney... cuz it sucks THAT much more busting @ the very end of playing all day!
http://yfrog.com/5eq7bj There's ALWAYS a moment for a Kodak moment. Right @TrishelleC & @SaraUnderwood?! ;-)
My table has replaced poker hottie  @vanessarousso with poker hottie @saraunderwood. Apparently it was too much hottness for one table.
http://yfrog.com/10lu4qj All my fav LA girls are here today playing the WSOP Ladies event: @MariaHo, @JenEliseCox... (insert @TrishelleC :-(
WSOP Ladies event today... Not surprisingly, I think there will be a serious lack of #WSOPHotGuyAlert s today.
http://yfrog.com/j9lsqfj Bad table draw but I love this girl so at least I'm guaranteed a fun time & a pretty view!
...in other news... kinda excited about the World Cup starting tomorrow.
Why is it that Celt fans feel the need yap all this trash talk towards LA & "fakers fans" yet u never hear us shovin our wins in your face?!
Time to look in the Laker portion of my closet & find something to wear tonight. LET'S GO LA!!!
@MariaHo If you keep making it deep in every tourney you play I'm DEFINITELY gonna polish off this box of popsicles all by myself at home!
Heard @ the Palazzo sportsbook = @MariaHo defending a Fisher hater (after he scores a hoop) by yelling "BECAUSE HE'S A VETERAN FOOL!!" lol
Vegas sportsbook w/ @MariaHo & @GregFBT... guess who orders a Strawberry Daquiri + Sprite w/ splash of cran + Fiji water. He's such a girl!
http://yfrog.com/g03cwlj Yes... we brought our Lakers bangers all the way from home to Las Vegas. Go team!
I apologize for the serious lack of #WSOPHotGuyAlert s... I haven't been spending very long days at the Rio but I'll get to it this week!
A 3.5hr drive from Vegas to LA ain't no thang when there's a Laker game at the end of it! :-)
Spent the day at Lake Mead with the girls & was inspired to film a silly little "MTV Boats" spoof video... http://bit.ly/9ybeHC

Back at Rio for #wsop36 the $2k NL & already the boy are shippin' me their chips & callin raises with 5/3 off & bottom pair. Yessss.
Enjoying another day off of poker but I'll be back at Rio tomorrow for the $2k NL #wsop36. Gonna snuggle up now for dinner and a movie.
Might just have to cancel my plans to play tomorrow and sweat @MariaHo down to the last 13 players in the $10k Limit Championships!
So excited 4 @MariaHo in the final 2 tables of the $10k Limit Championship! Enjoyed my day off of poker, got the Venetian Deepstack 2moro.
Obviously the donking of chips has begun. Managed 2 ship my comfy lead & 20k away. Sitting @ avg now with 1.5hrs left in the day.
2 more levels till the end of Day 1 in the 2k #wsop32 - got 42k with avg around 25k. 360-ish players left & about 150 will cash.
Back from dinner break in the 2k NL, won the 1st few pots I've played. @ 40k ish, 200/400 blinds with a 50a, 17k avg. Gonna try not 2 donk!
@VictoriaCoren It was wonderful playing with you today Vicky. Sorry I had to be the one to bust ya. Hope we play again soon, you're lovely!
My 3rd dinner break @ the WSOP, maybe I can turn it in2 a Day 2 then final table! Under 600plyrs from 1534, got 32k, bout double chip avg.
I interrupt my poker updates from the #wsop32 2k to report that I think Ben Fold's 'The Luckiest' is one of the most romantic songs ever!
On a sick run right now in the 2k NL event #wsop32, got 33k going into 2nd break, next level 100/200 with a 25a.
Wow the 1st time all Series I've had some chips! In the #wsop32 2k NL. Just knocked out @VictoriaCoren & had a lovely time with her!
Of course I have to be the one to bust @JoeSebok , 88 v. KQ. Sorry Joe! They broke our table but @VictoriaCoren still with me.
Uh-oh @VitoriaCoren just got the special 'doodaloo' double up zap that I sent 2ward @JoeSebok 's stack who's sitting next 2 her. I misfired.
Yeay! Another double up with Aces. Got a little time now with just over chip avg. But its early, only level 3 in #wsop32. Come on @joesebok!
On the race 2c which short stack will bust 1st between me & @joesebok I survived elimination KQ v KK, now its his turn 2 dub up!
@joesebok Wanna do the opposite of a last longer... like a "who'll bust quicker?!" #wsop32
Very exciting 2 see Roland de Wolfe win his 1st bracelet. Also cute seeing all my Brit friends light up when their national anthem played.
Good morning Rio! Hello $2k NL Event. Hope it's a long day for me & my table mates @joesebok & @victoriacoren.
Good day! Lakers win, good company, got some sun, did some shopping, now if I can figure out how 2 win the WSOP 2k 2moro!

Playin Venetian Deepstack, double up last hand before dinner. 100plyrs left, 36k chips with $1k/$2k blinds 300ante.
OMG. The player next 2 me just LOST it after losing QQ to AJ then punch his chips across the table & almost clipped me in the face. Scary!
Its never easy is it?! Went from 140k to losing every hand & pot for 2 levels. Down to 26k. Almost dinner, 140plyrs, avg 55k.
Venetian Deepstack treating me well! What an insane day of poker, calls & folds. Got 90k, chip avg 28k, 260plyrs left to fade!
Just saw Mark Podell who's playin @ Venetian. We chatted about all the fuss from our infamous Main Event hand last year.
After 2 hands in the 1500 & getting all in with top 2 (KQ) my fate has been decided & I'll be playing 2day's Deepstack event at Venetian.
Can't decide if I play the Venetian Deepstack or WSOP 1500 donkament today?!
Not the best way 2 start Ultimate Sports Wknd but fortunately hockey isn't my game. Sure was fun watchin @laceyjones cheer & curse @ the TV!
http://twitpic.com/78wda - At ESPN Zone with Sam Ryan (@sammyryr) & Lacey Jones (@laceyjones) toasting 2 their WINGS!

What a game! You know what I'm talking about! Oh yea, and Fish is my hero... reminded me of the old days.
Excited about the ultimate sports weekend @SammyRyRy and @LaceyJones and I are planning... kickin' it off with the Lakers game now!
Don't know if I should be thankful or bitter about my early exits. The 1500 tourny came down to 2 hands - KK v. Q10, AJ v. 810 no good!
Up and at 'em! Off to the Rio for today's $1500 NL luckfest!
In N' Out Burger at 1:00 AM, mmmm such a good way to end the day... or start the morning, depending on how you look at it!
Busted just before dinner break at the Venetian Deepstack tourney, typical KK v. AA - all in on an unders board. Hmpf
Venetian tourney going MUCH better than my brief appearance @ Rio 2day. Got lotsa chips, over 450 players for this $550 Deepstack.
Fav song that I'm jammin 2 today: Usher's Love In This Club. Guilty Pleasure song of the day: Miley Cyrus' The Climb lol.
At least I busted in time to heasd to Venetian & play their Deepstack tourney today. Gonna try to redeem myself :-)
Well THAT was my quickest bust ever! 30min and I'm out AK diamonds v. Kings
Back at the Rio today! $1500 NL Shootout. Got Mike Sexton at my table.
Just bumped in2 Paul Wasicka (@kwickfish) at Palazzo valet, man he's def 1 of the cutest poker players! Home & bed now, 2500 6handed 2moro.
Somehow found my way 2 Venetian poker room & am sitting @ a 2/5 game with @morganmachina & Jerry Yang.
@laceyjones was told she's not being loud enough rooting 4 the Lakers so she's starting 'woot woot'-ing & its adorable!

Gonna enjoy a bit of Vegas sun while I have some time on my hands then head to the sports book for a little Laker game party!
Out of the Ladies event, don't get many chips 2 start. Made an iffy call with top pair (aces), she had a set of queens. Bye Rio hello Lakers
SIGH. Started with 3k in the Ladies event, down to 500 after a blind v blind hand, flopped trip 4's jack kicker she had a queen.
Sigh. Gonna put the day & $5k tourney behind me, get some rest and play the Ladies event tomorrow. Even on a bad poker day my life is great!
Somedays I hate poker. All in A10 spades v A9 flop 10 J Q 4... & take a wild guess what comes on the river. Ug, an 8 and I'm out!
Level 8 now, 300/600 with 75a. We play 2 more levels 2nite, I've got 12k & didn't see a single face card the entire last level. 333 left.
WOW I just got the ugliest double up ever! I was all in pre with K5 v. AK, flop 532... 8... K!!! 15k now @ 200/400 with a 50a.
Was down to 4500, picked up queens in the big blinds & got Grinder 2 double me up! 16min till dinner, I'll be happy with 1 more dub-up.
One more level till dinner break. Owen & Grinder behaving themselves. Got 9k, blinds 150/300 w/ 25, avg 20k.
Just got moved to a new table in the 5k with Grinder and the super cute Owen Crowe. 13k chips, just down from our starting stack of 15k.
Paul Wolfe is 2 my left & keeping me entertained, he's 1 of the nicest plyrs I've met! PS Good luck to @joesebok on Day 2 of the 2500!
http://twitpic.com/6rzba - Do you not have to stand when they play the National Anthem & its not your country?
Playin the 5k its a pro heavy field but no recognizable faces @ my table. Its gonna be a fun day, these guys are super talkative & friendly.
Another day, another dollar, another bust... ahh poker. Might play the $5k NL 2moro if I'm not too wiped.
Barely staying alive, now nursing 4350 (avg 28k) ha ha, next level is 400/800 with 100a. We've got a LONG way to go kids!
Livin' on a prayer now. got knocked down to 1500, had top pair against aces. Blinds 300/600... I've got one move!
