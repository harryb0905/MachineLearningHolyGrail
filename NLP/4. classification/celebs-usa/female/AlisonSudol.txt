@GreenpeaceUK Thank you so much, it was a life-changing trip! And yes! We are on it! #protectAntarctic !
@floch_x First of all, it's so good that you got help, that was brave and the first step towards a healthier life. I think the first thing really that's most important is really focusing on self-care, therapy, getting healthy. Your joy will return naturally, just give it time and care
@MrsMarie_ I was so scared to do it, and still trying to shake off remnants of shame around it, but honestly, it really changed everything for me. Just make sure you get the right meds. Sometimes it takes a few tries. Good luck!

@katherinenews17 talk to anyone about the difficult experiences I had when I was younger, and so I let the scary things dictate a lot of how I approached boys and relationships. you are not wrong for being upset, and you don't have to deal with this alone.
@katherinenews17 like it wasn't something that you wanted, or if it scared you. or even just that you thought you wanted it and changed your mind, and weren't listened to or respected. it's so important to work through these things with someone, so they don't stick with you. i didn't know how to-
@katherinenews17 do you have someone that you can talk to about it? a family member or trusted adult? these kind of situations have happened to more girls/women than you can imagine (myself included) even situations that aren't outright sexual assault or abuse can still be traumatic if you felt-
@katherinenews17 first of all, i am so sorry that happened to you. secondly, i'm not qualified to give advice on this sort of thing, especially not knowing the specifics, but it sounds like it was a deeply upsetting event for you + that is something you shouldn't ignore or put yourself down for.
wow, look at how cool that is! @louismasai + @SynchEarth are teaming up with @zsllondonzoo to bring awareness to the #EDGEspecies -  you can go watch him paint until july 20th- definitely worth a visit (and also to say hi to the giraffes) hooray for #conservationoptimism https://t.co/11LztgdJFM

@herrero_noelia7 yoga. CBD oil is great. there this app https://t.co/AsTYriuwaR which I've heard is great. if it is very bad, I'd speak to a doctor. clinical anxiety is scary but can definitely be managed! don't worry, there are many things that can help you! just breathe + try to slow down ❤️
@herrero_noelia7 i'm so sorry to hear that, and i get it too. have you seen a doctor about it? there are many things you can do for anxiety, but it depends on the severity. there are kundalini breathing exercises you can do, meditation, walks in nature. Sometimes i listen to an audio book or do-
@vonprond it is so scary. it's far reaching and insidious and needs our attention and imagination big time to handle it (on a lighter note, hi!)
@TwxstedWxcca but if you can start to check in with yourself more while you're this busy, you can start to get a better idea of what you need. also, @TaraBrach has some great meditations if you need something to listen to to calm your spirit https://t.co/U9ZAxVZGMd
@TwxstedWxcca it seems like you really need to do some self-care! I'm trying a thing where I take five deep breaths when I start to feel like I'm running + running. Just slow down for a moment, put your hands on your heart. in the long run, you may need to shift your schedule to be healthier-

@fantastcwizards @mrdanfogler that's great! i love that!
@queentrinket of course I'm angry, but I want to channel that anger in to action, to helping people who are doing positive things, to doing something, otherwise that anger will just eat me up. in my opinion, it's important to get angry, but i prefer to use that energy for good when i can.
to create space for us all to exist together. to build bridges, not keep burning them down and reinforcing how separate we all are. we all live on this planet together, after all.
but there are so many incredible things happening for women in this time- it's a time where change actually does seem possible, where the system feels like it's actually capable of shifting, even if it takes time. that makes me excited. we need to work together- all of us humans-
relationship between human beings.
i deleted my tweet earlier because i think i could have said that better. i celebrate women, all women, and am saddened by the misogyny, racism, anger and political rage in reaction to #celebratewomen it's just an indication of how far we have to go to create a balanced + healthy
I celebrate these women bigtime. Whoa. Brave. Hundreds and hundreds poachers are killed trying to protect wildlife- it is a terrifying job and these women are doing it, and with a smile. #CelebrateWomen https://t.co/vgjbt8ZOvD
hi everyone! sorry i've been silent. i've been up to my eyeballs in everything lately. a lot lot going on on every front, and haven't felt very much like being on social media. i'll be back soon! xx
@fantastcwizards happy birthday, my dear! have the most beautiful day, full of fresh air (when you get off the plane), love, laughter, joy and cake. so much cake. have fun!!! xx
Such a nice piece on my friend @Kristin_Ess - she and I had some serious fun with my very long, very red hair back in the day. I love the story behind why she did her line and am very proud of her, it's been a long time coming + the line is fab! https://t.co/cZnrfgdrWZ
this is a powerful article. what an intelligent, eloquent, courageous person. again, i am deeply inspired by these exceptional young voices. keep the heat on, kids, we will change this broken system eventually. https://t.co/M5xAYNMhqG
last night, i went to see my dear friend @jayduplass in the tender + thought-provoking new film that he + the very wonderful @lynnsheltonfilm made- it's called "outside in" it's out friday and a very worthy thing to see. highly recommend!
@TwxstedWxcca tomorrow, listen to your body, and when it's time to go, go. and if you need to go take a break to calm yourself while you're there, go to the bathroom and take at least 5 deep breaths. feel the earth under your feet. you can handle this!
@TwxstedWxcca oof, that is not easy at all, i'm so sorry to hear that. anticipation is the worst! maybe try to take slow deep breaths, count to 4, hold for a sec, then let it out for 4 counts. one breath at a time. tomorrow, you won't be alone. keep breathing, remember you are safe now + brave
@jacobandqueenie "I actually think my body is pretty gorgeous, and I'm going to treat it well, make healthy choices so it feels good, dance in it, breathe in it, kiss with it, and savor being alive." If you focus on being kind to yourself, other people will take note. x
@jacobandqueenie with so much body shame- still dealing with it, frankly, although at 33 i am starting to find it very boring. we need to work on new standards of beauty in society, which is going to take time, but it starts with each one of us saying, "yeah, I'm not going to accept that,-"
@jacobandqueenie that negative energy starts to move out of your body. a good old fashioned "f*** it! that's your deal!" said loudly while dancing also can be cathartic ;) the way that our society is set up, where skinny is the only form of acceptable beauty, is so stupid. I have personally dealt
@jacobandqueenie urgh, i'm sorry he made fun of you! i want to say something super wise here, but i'm not sure what would actually help... i guess one thing is to communicate how it made you feel. another is to do what i do sometimes, which is have a little dance party with myself until some of-
@TwxstedWxcca @alisudolupdates it's such a beautiful note. you are so strong, and such an intelligent, insightful person. i am so honored by your words, and your constant care and unbelievable attention to detail. thank you for your openness and your courage, it's inspiring ❤️
I’m moving in to my new place and very grubby and perhaps might be using a little bit of magic, but seriously, can you blame me?  #wandsup !! Aaaand the #CrimesofGrindlewald teaser trailer is out today watch it now!! https://t.co/KVYHZ8SZh0 ❤️✨❤️✨ https://t.co/EgqS15MyH7
@Feferang @nytimes Yes!!! So exciting!
And as Greenpeace’s Antarctic Ambassador, I’d like to share this video to introduce you to some of the badass women I had the pleasure of getting to know on the Arctic Sunrise. They seem to be able to survive without hairdressers, somehow... ;) https://t.co/knYeX5fweQ
It’s not only ok to be human in our womanhood, it’s gorgeous. It’s real. My heart is held together by the extraordinary women I hold in it. I can’t imagine a world without them. I am enfolding you in this embrace, with all of us, and wishing you a very happy #internationwomensday
It’s ok to not know what you’re doing, to feel things that seemingly contradict each other, make mistakes. We may have the gift of excellent instincts, but we also have a society that actively teaches us to ignore them. So, in finding our truth, our paths, we’re bound to stumble.
I’m learning each day to embrace more of myself, especially the parts I don’t particularly like. I’m learning that being a woman is not about getting it right, being a saint, being nice, always having it together. It’s not about “being good” or doing what you think you should do.
May we allow ourselves to be courageous and scared, vivid and boring, loving and grumpy, messy, flawed, generous, volatile, intelligent, curious, pissed off, bold, big, powerful, uncertain, whatever, all of it.
Thinking of all the incredible women in this wide world tonight. May we celebrate all the colors within us- including those that perhaps may be considered un-beautiful by society.
@cade_jackson I’m not sure! Will see! And new music is coming soon :)
David + I talked long + hard in Antarctica about many serious things. It’s hard to be serious when penguins keep making fun of you behind your head. It’s also hard to be serious when someone keeps saying puke all the time.  Someone * cough @DavidKHarbour https://t.co/jrP50lz0qN https://t.co/jTPKnCx55W
@RMHCUK It was such a sweet day! Big hugs to the kids, I loved meeting everyone!

Live stream is happening in just under an hour and a half- if you have any questions for me (or someone on board ) ask away!
I think I’m going to attempt a livestream today, 5pm our time, which is 3PM EST, noon PST, 8PM GMT... I’ll show you around a little and introduce you to some of my shipmates 🚢
It’s our first day on the water. All I can really do is lie down and roll with the waves. Slightly green, but it’s also strangely calming... kind of rocks you to sleep, if you let it. I’m letting it. #protectantarctic #dayoneatsea

@EstherHorvath3 @DavidKHarbour @Greenpeace She’s gorgeous!! Can’t wait to climb aboard!
Have you ever seen dead coral? It has such an eerie quality... even paradise can’t escape the damage we’re doing to our ocean. Sad + mad + feeling more committed than ever to helping any way I can, it’s all i can do 🌊💔 - much love to @Greenpeace @SynchEarth @IUCN @SylviaEarle
Went snorkeling this morning, on the last day of island living before we start our long, exciting journey to the bottom of the world..was so excited to see the coral and the undersea wildlife in the warm waters before the cold. The sight was devastating.
@megsie_walsh Deep breaths beforehand, maybe a little walk or dance it out in the bathroom. Keep your body moving and trust that you are prepared and that will take over when the lights are on!
@MissMajaFox @Greenpeace There will be much cataloguing!!! We are so excited to share this experience with everyone.

For some time now, I’ve been hoping to find a way to collaborate with you guys, because the art I’ve seen you create, esp around Beasts, has been so inspiring! Now we have a chance, and for a good cause too- kids, @lumos + Christmas
Sorry NOT 12:30, 1:00pm PST! See you in three hours and 15 min!

Especially when I eat off little corners and then try to pretend I haven’t.
Every time I bake my kitchen looks like the apocalypse, and so do I. But it smells so good, and makes me so happy.
I totally believe in all kinds of “impossible” things. Or at least, I totally believe that we have no idea what is or isn’t possible, so why not? Also I love that all Yetis do is lurk.  https://t.co/jv9acBqfW5
no @katmac95 *I* don’t smell like soup. haha. at least, I don’t think I do...
everywhere I walk today seems to smell like soup.
if they don’t want to be hugged, perhaps there’s a good reason for it. That doesn’t mean kids shouldn’t be given a tremendous amount of love, physical affection and compassion, just that they should be treated with respect and not forced into it.
Wow, this really struck me. Kids have very little control in their lives- I know I felt that way- but they should have a say over their body &amp; be able to say no if they don’t want to be hugged. I think kids have great instincts &amp; tend to choose affection if they have a choice so- https://t.co/QrhWJcbCBr

I’m going to now go snuggle into the countryside with no service (heaven!) but before I do, one last little promo so I feel I did my bit
I’ve never had such a relaxed release day. A release day that actually felt like a release. Soon will be able to tell you more about why that is, a very big shift in the way we’re going about this that is making it all... just..  fun... and warmmm
Also had quite a big day on set today. And also had some things happen on a personal level that were quite powerful and good.
So moved and tickled pink by all the lovely feedback about the music today. It means a lot. Thank you.
@jk_rowling @EstuaryArtists @AliChant_Toybox Thank you, Jo!!! Much love ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻

Going to meditate on all the magic I experienced tonight at the @britishlibrary with @lumos and see how on Earth we can bring some to South Dakota. Because goodness knows it’s going to take some extraordinary measures to clean up this mess (which COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED)
@jk_rowling @Evy_Lynch @jasonsfolly @lumos @britishlibrary Of course! So happy to support such an important cause! And the exhibition is AMAZING! I had no idea you were such a gifted artist, your drawings are wonderful! And all those magical sources, wow, so inspiring!
this hurts so much, yet isn’t a surprise... thinking about the reservations, the wildlife who will suffer, + the tribes + all who stood together at Standing Rock who knew, spoke out, did all they could, but those who only care about money &amp; power didn’t listen. this must change. https://t.co/0zRAEmvb0M

but in the meantime, if you’d like to join in I would love if you would read a chapter from Women Who Run with the Wolves so we can discuss-
Good morning! I won’t be doing the livestream tonight because I have a thing to go to and also I need a bit more time to process some stuff-
We have to help protect our majestic blue planet...
Goodness, #BluePlanet2 is blowing my mind, breaking my heart + making me fall even more in love with this planet than I was before @BBCOne

@SudolsDoll 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🐋🌎 so so very glad
thank you for reminding me that being courageous, pursuing truth and helping others is always the way to go, even when it’s super scary
can be enough to completely alter your life. The remains of my old heart shell are busted, dust. Feeling raw, definitely, messy, but open ❤️
If I had known a week ago what kind of rocket my last livestream was going to launch me on, I would have buckled my seatbelt. Just 7 days-
listening while making things with colors... mmm... https://t.co/oacoSVC3uG #colleen
(that said, daytime fireworks are also super cool..)but stars need the night sky too, so whatever. You know what I mean. Bring on the light.
can do, it means the dark no longer has the power. Without the dark sky, how would you see the fireworks?
when you have to look at something you don’t know if you can bear to see. But to bring light into that dark is the most courageous act you-
I feel each burst keenly. Today has not been an easy day. Sometimes healing requires deep and unflinching truth-seeking, and can really hurt
It’s so interesting this week happens to be Diwali. The sky around us full of explosive, powerful, exuberant colour. Light overcoming dark.
@fantastcwizards Breathe. Slowly, quietly. Sometimes I go to the bathroom to have a quiet moment. Maybe do some dance moves. Move the energy around!
Feeling happy + immensely grateful. Sending love. Will return properly to socials soon, just needed a breather.  Good things cooking! ❤️❤️🙏🏻
That’s amazingly weird and great. Happy birthday @mrdanfogler Brazil loves you and so do we! https://t.co/i3JqvROg15
+ buried for ages. This is getting long, maybe I'll write a little note instead so I'm not writing a 47 tweet diatribe that's hard to read!
with each other in a deep, honest, healthy way. And that first, I know a lot of anger is going to have to come out, because it's been stuck
also this extraordinary moment we find ourselves in in history- a chance to heal such old wounds, to bring light into darkness, to unite-
I just want to say that I am thinking a lot about the conversations we have started, about the way men and women relate to each other. And-
(I'm totally fine, btw, it's a head cold, no biggie, and I think my body's way of making me sit still so I can feel what I feel. It's good!)
by running around town like I would normally be doing. Sitting with all the emotion that's been kicked up and observing how I actually feel.
I have been wrestling with some good old-fashioned demons since monday night, and it's quite interesting, not being able to distract myself-
hello friends ❤️ i woke up feeling a bit sick and i think my body is trying to release long pent up emotions via snot.
Because the only shaming that is going to be ok once we’re through is dog shaming. #SorryNotSorry
https://t.co/NQVjuHipBO
So I’m just going to make a dramatic move + post something that helped me fall asleep last night when I was all riled up. Just 2 shake it up
know how to change the subject w/out seeming like it’s going away. It’s not going away. These are conversations that need to become the norm
As much as the outpouring of support I’m receiving is knocking my socks off, though, I do want to say that it’s a bit overwhelming + I don’t
and long overdue. It feels like something seismic is shifting. It’s messy, as old, repressed sadness + ghosts are being let out. But wow.
I am seriously bowled over by the reaction to last night’s livestream. The conversations that are being opened up are incredibly powerful-
@missAmandaReed Awww ❤️Thank you honey!
@UnicornAuthor I am SO glad!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
@SudolsDoll absolutely! i will follow you and you can DM me! i'm going to go off socials for the evening but i will write you tomorrow. ❤️

exemplifying that true leaders don’t pull the kind of crap that old-school misogynistic jerks managed to get away with for way too long.
men set an excellent example for others, who respect women- some who are downright feminists, who have restored my faith in men personally-
I’ve met so many beautiful, kind, gentle, wonderful men in positions of influence, men that are leaders who do not abuse their power. These-
bring it upon myself. It affected my view of men, and made me question whether there were any decent ones out there. But in the past years-
I’ve had my fair share of dealings with people in power positions who made me feel uncomfortable and vulnerable, wondering what I’d done to-
May this be the end of an era of men abusing their power and women feeling powerless to stop them. We have a voice and we have each other. https://t.co/NLolvDRy3K

@angiemagz So glad! Thanks for watching!
@RosieBeck I’m so happy! I had such fun! Thanks for tuning in!

If you missed tonight’s two part live stream with the v. unplanned and v unexpected (even to me) ending, it will be up for 24 hrs on insta
Weird countdown alert- see you in 35 minutes on instagram xx
@EtanHuijs There is absolutely music coming!
To clarify, for tonight, I’d love to talk about working on keeping an open, loving heart in the face of all that life brings to challenge it
Heart aching for Las Vegas... How many of these tragedies need to happen for the US to realise gun laws HAVE TO CHANGE? I do not understand.
please send me questions if you have them!
There will be another live stream later tonight- in light of what happened in Vegas, the theme will be choosing love instead of...8:30pm GMT
I found my first grey hair and I feel like throwing her a party. #welcometothefold

@NoMore93 so glad! working on another one! :)
@1littlehelper oh yes! i started that but left it in New York. she seems to be a beautiful teacher!
@AdeleGreen89 do you have anyone you can talk about it to?
@AdeleGreen89 parents are people, and that they struggle and make mistakes just like we all do. I can only imagine how painful this must have been for you
@AdeleGreen89 that happened to you. It's so hard, these things have such a lasting impact on us when they happen as children. So hard to understand that-
@AdeleGreen89 oh wow, I don't know how to say anything properly on twitter, as this must be a very intimate and sensitive issue... firstly, I'm so sorry-
watching a big spider patiently build her web in the garden outside my window. will try not 2 walk through it with my face like i usually do

18 minutes - I should have written at 20 but I was doing something else! See you soon (my instagram is  @alisonsudol)
I'll pick two or three questions to address along that theme- if you have one, send between now +when I go live +I'll do my best to answer!
Tonight's theme will (very loosely) be self-care and gentleness and will probably wander all over the place..but that's where it will begin!
@herrero_noelia7 Perfect!
@1littlehelper Of course!
@angiemagz I actually have no idea what time the live stream will be anywhere but England. Check your world clock- 9pm UK time! Xx
@angiemagz Actually it might be 1pm PST!
So let's say this evening, we meet again on instagram at 9pm GMT (noon PST). If you can light a candle, please do. Let's get cosy.
Thinking of doing another fairly-disorganised but very human live stream this eve (UK time- afternoon in the US). Will be back w/details!

@nicharcourt which has made me approach social media w/ caution. But there's a huge amount of love + kindness out there too, and I want to feed that!
@nicharcourt Nic, so kind of you to say, thank you❤️ it's true, there's a freedom people feel to anonymously indiscriminately bully online that's so ugly
@raven_puff1903 oof sorry you're sick! hope you rest up and feel better soon!
@aghuntress2735 what kind words! thank you. it actually made me just a littttttle bit more determined to do it again... ha!
@fantastcwizards that's beautiful! i'm so glad, that makes me happy!
@raven_puff1903 totally not the point! i'm wearing my pjs! hehe. no it's seriously fine, and honestly really quite good for me :)
@MrsMarie_ i'm so sorry you had a difficult evening! sending you light and warmth, so glad to have helped to ease it a little
as for the vast majority of people who are warm, kind, honest + supportive- hugging you all with my heart, which feels a little bigger now❤️
myself that it's crippling. but faced with a dumb comment from someone who certainly wouldn't say that to my face, it lit a necessary fire.
honestly, though, and thank you lovely friends who are defending me and saying nice things. it's quite alright. sometimes i am so unkind to-
for stirring up my rebel spirit. it was feeling a little lacklustre today.
and it's making me smile because that just makes me want to do it again. and wear no makeup. and have a zit. thank you, faceless mean folks-
it's quite interesting, to do something live with open commenting, how certain people feel utterly free to say I don't look very good.
@1littlehelper i haven't but will check it out! thank you! i will (and maybe be a bit more organized next time!) xx
@NoMore93 a mix! no idea what was playing, but i'm thinking of making a little playlist to share!
@_sangate_ i'm so glad! i do too (obviously) but am so bored of letting it win! i hope you enjoy the books, they both are quite powerful! x
@angiemagz of course! was more than a little out of my comfort zone but educational! "women who run with the wolves"
I'll be doing it via instagram, i'm alisonsudol on there! see you in 5! x
ok cool :) i guess that's a yes! i'm going to make dinner and figure out how to use the internet. see you at 9PM GMT x
I'm thinking of trying out doing a live video reading this evening (in about half an hour) as an experiment- would you guys be into that?
@1littlehelper I loved Mustang!

@dale_pinnock I love it! I can't wait to try some of the recipes! You don't happen to teach, do you?

@fantastcwizards Just keep going! It is beautiful!!
@Darknessflame97 I hear that you feel that way, but there is always hope. Do you need help, sweetheart? Can I connect you with someone to talk to?
This is disgusting. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to be a solider, and equally to be trans. To be both is to be heroic in nature. https://t.co/gnk6zRgJ8C
@SudolsDoll Oh my goodness, I just saw... 😡
@SudolsDoll I must have missed it, what happened this time? 😟
@alisudolupdates Friends are so important, we all need each other to navigate life, to share in our joys and hold us in times of sorrow.
@alisudolupdates Your poor heart! I'll bet there are quite a few people out there who are also going through heartbreak + who'd like a friend to talk to.
@alisudolupdates Fun! I change my hair when I'm going through things too, used to cut my fringe on tour- u could tell my mental state by how short they were!
@alisudolupdates my own mind and overwhelming emotions. Do you have someone you love that you can talk to? A spot of nature to walk in?
@alisudolupdates Hello sweetheart! I'm so sorry to hear you're having a hard time, and I honestly understand that feeling, I have struggled quite a bit with-

@SudolsDoll absolutely! every little bit helps. we're finding solidarity now, people who care about the planet are coming together slowly but surely.
@SudolsDoll what is your degree in?
@SudolsDoll me too, but we have to use our anger to fuel our imaginations + our determination not to let this kind of behavior win. nature needs us!
@gabtassone growing up isn't easy! but the more you crack your heart open with kindness and love, the more you will expand as a human, woman, + artist.

@magnoliahawks - forget it isn't actually our own truth.

@fgiulianna I do it to myself better than anyone else could.
@styleskrasinski I think everyone struggles in one way or another. There's so much emphasis on "skinny" in our society + much less focus on health.
Talking about my own body issues is something I've shied away from, but I wonder if it would be helpful for you friends out there if I did?
@QueenyStein Seriously. It's very toxic. I definitely struggle  with it, especially being in an industry so focused on appearance.
@QueenyStein the thing is, no one ever comments on my weight, but the pressure I put on myself is staggering sometimes.
thinking about ever since.
🌸 @therelationtrip clever, belly-laughable + endearing, but also deals with body image issues in an original + poignant way that I've been-

out on each other, but when it's directed towards things that need to be fought for, that deserve a voice, that fight is a beautiful thing.
at risk, the future of our planet hangs in the balance. We have so much fight in us as humans that we don't know what to do with- we take it
So inspired by the amazing turnout on yesterday's #marchforscience across the globe. When science + nature (+ women's rights etc etc) are -
@BadWolfKaily The books are all about the language, the sparks they create in the imagination. I can't imagine any movie capturing that.
@BadWolfKaily Definitely not! No no noooooo
@hpshum The books cover many things. They're YA but universal- about science, nature, love, adventure, family, growth, mystery, the universe.

@Leo_lover1203 @shxphxrd @13ReasonsWhy I am so sorry to hear that! That's awful! Do you have support?
@mxdwn Yes! Coming soonish!
@whystydia It's an important topic to be talking about! Bullying can have devastating effects, in school and throughout life. We all need to see that.
@SudolsDoll No, it's just this modern social media which is hard on language as a whole! Glad your grandma is better! 🌸🙏🏻
@whystydia Yes, I found it extremely powerful, it deeply affected me and I think about it still quite a bit
dancing is the best.

@MsGoldsteinS I'm so sorry for your loss, I meant to say. It's so hard to lose someone you love. There are people that are there to help if you need it.
@MsGoldsteinS I am so sorry! I'm going to bed now but can look for some sites where you can talk to people if you need support.
@MsGoldsteinS I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have someone you can talk to?

@enemyofmuggle @gayIupins I don't have a favorite animal, though I love wolves, elephants, whales, horses, red pandas, tigers, bears + more
@SettleDownLay I was shy too. Whenever I get shy I just ask people questions about themselves- it's interesting + gets me out of my head!
@gayIupins great! maybe she thinks you don't need her help. finding commonality + letting her know she's needed might help- let me know!
@ohmyhorcrux about the whole. one step at a time, find one thing you can do. Maybe figure out one thing you can be curious about + follow it
@ohmyhorcrux hmmm... I've struggled a lot with motivation too. I'd say maybe just try to take the first step, do one thing, don't worry -
@fantastcwizards that's incredible!!!!! Good for you!
@gayIupins hmmm... maybe try to ask questions about the work, really think about what she is teaching and be curious about it?
@ledgerstyles be you, my dear! that's the best person you can be. learn and cultivate who you are and run with it ❤
@ledgerstyles I love animals, of course. Each and every creature has a little magic about them.
@seabluelester amazing!! I love hearing that! Yes it does!
@StevenM1995 of course! Reaching out is brave and the first step towards change. good luck!!
@gayIupins if u can learn how to connect with people you don't understand, find some commonality with them, infinite possibities can unfold
@gayIupins hmm...maybe take this teacher as a challenge to learn how to connect with someone you don't get? maybe try asking them for help?
@TheHxngergxames I love them all, for different reasons. I love plants with big leaves + tiny leaves, needles, feathery grasses + blossoms

@karmandabynes @The_OA so many feelings!!
Also, @jasonsfolly you were so good at being creepy I am now slightly scared of you... but in a fun way! Yay for scary friends!
we stayed up till 6am watching the whole @The_OA series- once we started, couldn't stop. left swimming with questions, yet hearts so full...
@angiemagz that's me! Thanks!
@m_chain0114 so shocking, but sadly that's the state the world is in. However, 1st step is awareness, the 2nd, finding out how to help!
@mteresin @WILDfoundation that's amazing!! Yay!
@jacobandqueenie you can create one! Be the change you want to see in the world!
you're all making my day, so much, can't even tell you! i have to go get ready now but i am so grateful + inspired by you! to be continued!
@redmaynewt i'm so sorry you had a horrible day but so glad this cheered you up!
@raven_puff1903 let me know if you need help getting info about where to start! i'd begin with finding something you love + want to help!
@raven_puff1903 perhaps you could start a group with other like-minded students? i am constantly amazed by how much students are able to do
@fantastcwizards maybe the best way to start is to do s/thing on a local level, learn about the forests in your area + what help they need?
@ginnyweazIey do, do! good luck!!!
@alisudolupdates than the giants. slowly, 1 step at a time, take actions toward what you believe in. tortoise + the hare, you know that one?
@alisudolupdates I am so sorry it's been so hard for you! but that difficulty is the fire that forges you- you are stronger + more resilient
@lumosbex but you are our future, you have heart and energy and passion! what do you care about?
@ginnyweazIey sounds great! follow your intuition + let it grow from there. don't be afraid to make mistakes- doing it is how you learn!
@gayIupins haha 💞 wonderful!!!! scream and then do it! you have all the power within you to make a real difference.
@ginnyweazIey about and how you can turn those passions into actions? 🌍💞
@ginnyweazIey maybe start a group with your friends, meet once a week and talk about what's happening in your lives, what you are passionate
@ginnyweazIey women have such deep innate intuition and connection with nature + need support in order to turn those gifts into action!
@gayIupins perhaps start a little group of like-minded women who need support and find things you can do together?
@enemyofmuggle @Jiimedii i see you! :)
@gayIupins do you love animals? the forest on the edge of your town? do you love the sea or rivers, jellyfish or bison or wolves or bears?
@gayIupins time, heart + energy are far more valuable than money! think of something that you love enough to fight for, that's a start
@Jiimedii I think it starts w/ getting more active in our own communities, where we can see the problem + the results of our actions quickly
@mteresin i know, it's heartbreaking. that's so beautiful, thank you for caring 🐘
@ohmywatson amazing! please let me know if i can help!
@tylorstarr fantastic! it depends on what you want to do- i have friends at the @IUCN , @SynchEarth and @peta who all do work with animals!
we can ask our friends at @SynchEarth and the @IUCN how friends in Japan can help the planet- they're the experts! 💞 https://t.co/RS5VZmVZtd

@mteresin an estimated 100 African elephants are killed every day by poachers- if you love them, I'm sure any help would be appreciated!
@NotWithThisFace that's amazing!!! there is but it's so rewarding when you do.
@livinings then let's not hope, let's do it :)
@akihiko0827w i will be back this year!
@tylorstarr there are many ways! are there animals in particular you love? where are you in the world? i can direct you to some sites!
@FwooperFdn i'm having trouble checking out your site, is the link working?
@fgiulianna it's SO difficult, it's the hardest thing, to break the cycle of feeling like we don't matter and so why bother. but we CAN!
@fanaticbeasts there is no action too small :)
@livinings absolutely! find something that you love enough to want to protect, and then fight for it! in real life!
part of the beauty of that article is this conversation. what, then, are you going to do? (I ask myself that every DAY but now it's ON!)
@redmaynewt beautiful! as long as the hope doesn't undermine the DO! yes!
@mteresin that's beautiful!! everyone has their unique gifts, and putting them to use is exactly what that article was talking about
@stephrogerson thank you for doing that, that's amazing!!!! cheers to you and those you work with!
better than I can." and then do nothing.
by the vastness of the problems out there and think, "I am too small, it's too big + I know there are people braver than I who can handle it
people out there fighting hard for animals that face extinction, against deforestation, climate change, etc. It's so easy to get overwhelmed
I find myself getting so lulled, hoping that someone else is going to solve the issues our planet is facing, because I know there are great-
@emmahounsomex of course we need to stay optimistic, but it's so easy to use hope as a blanket to keep us comfortable. it's time to DO now!
@mteresin absolutely- it's the false sense of security + placing of responsibility upon entities outside of ourselves that keeps us inactive
@FwooperFdn thank you for turning that hope into action! we need that more than anything these days. save the real life fantastic beasts!
@Bibliowitch @redorangeearth yes!
once you read it, let's talk about it.

there's a lot of healing we can do right now as a society. it's crazy but things are moving. this is a time where we can shift the paradigm.
Therefore, we need to make sure bullies don't actually win.
I hope all the staggering stupidity that is dominating our news now (ahem TRUMP) will serve the purpose of showing kids bullies don't win.
I, and a multitude of others, am standing with you and Standing Rock, @shailenewoodley , thank you for being so courageous #NoDAPL

#BlackLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter ♥︎
We have the power to foster unity, kindness and compassion in a world which is in dire need of it. Sometimes just a smile can go a long way.
The energy that each of us puts into the world affects everything. Tiny choices &amp; actions can have massive impact.
that said, it's a lot harder to end a human life with your bare hands than with a weapon.
Guns don't kill people, people kill people... just as fear kills compassion, and without compassion, man is a brutal creature.
There is so much fear in our society, its corrosive &amp; the more we feed it by trying to wall ourselves against each other, the more it grows
#PhilandoCastile's mother: "We're ... hunted every day. It's a sign of war against African-American people as a whole." Just chilling...

@unicorniopotter she is very kind and full of love
funny how it can be quiet or loud, a tempest or a cough. a slight move, some deep shift and a whole world opens up. suddenly you're free.
earlier I called tomorrow new year's instead of independence day- but perhaps it's its own kind of new year. newfound freedom, new beginning
listening to fireworks exploding somewhere over the city through my window half asleep and feeling them under my ribs.

@ckcff I actually am ♡
maybe starting a dialogue about it would be a good thing to do rather than playing ostrich &amp; sticking my head in the sand (sand + tears= ew)
working on how to start communicating more how I'm feeling when I'm uncomfortable, because I figure I'm not the only one who feels like this
by the way, I've been quiet because the world events of last week just had me so devastated I couldn't even figure out what to say.

Girls, please know that if someone in a position of power ever puts sexual pressure on you, it's not ok. It's never ok. Don't be ashamed.
As an artist,the only thing that should be required of you is to be a professional. You should not feel physically or emotionally endangered
(cont'd) what kind of message does this ruling send? protecting the men young women need to be protected from. Disgusting. #kesha I'm with u

@pamagotchi and I truly hope that the fires were an accident. Regardless, there is hatred directed at refugees daily. It's a bigger problem.
