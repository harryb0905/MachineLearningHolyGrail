It's a new day, fresh start, fresh energy, new opportunities. Get your mind right, be thankful, be positive and start your day right.
You have the power within yourself to make anything possible, you must diminish the doubt and ignite the self belief.
Make up your mind to be happy today. No matter what, let no one &amp; no situation take that away from you. Hold on to your joy.

One day you will realize that material things mean nothing, all that matters is the well being of the people in your life.
Salt Lake City bound to watch @USSpeedskating and some short track! And to catch up with some of my favorite people!
The beautiful thing about life is that you can always change, grow and get better. You aren't defined by your past or your mistakes.
Life is short. Break the rules, forgive quickly, kiss slowly, love truly, laugh uncontrollably &amp; never regret anything that made you smile.
A fun, eventful weekend with family and friends! Smokin' on the Wolf Bbq cook-off, Amos Lee‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7z3UcujfOa
Make your happiness and personal growth a priority in your life. The more you take care of yourself, the more you can take care of others.
When you see something beautiful in someone, tell them. It may take seconds to say, but for them, it could last a lifetime.
Don't let challenges scare you. Everything you experience is meant to make you stronger and better.
Had a blast exploring ATL over the weekend. #segwaytour #worldofcocacola #aquarium #cnn #sixflags https://t.co/VvWjhwkiNu
If you want to help someone, encourage them to do what makes them happy and show them love.
It's okay to restart and recreate. Don't spend time beating yourself up over something that went wrong. There's always another chance.
I'll never forget walking into the stadium for Opening Ceremonies for my first Olympics back in‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wt2MOKx3CD
Be authentic. Speak sincerely. Listen thoughtfully. Act compassionately and love. Always love. What we bring to life becomes our life.
As you start and end your day, be thankful for every little thing in your life. You will come to realize how blessed you truly are.
Love more. Care more. We may enjoy physical things, but they don't satisfy the soul quite like love and care does.
Consistent progress. Learn and improve every day. You'll always look back and be thankful for the effort that you put into yourself.
Be confident. Embrace conversation. Take chances. Ask questions. Make mistakes. Learn. Know your worth. Love true. Smile.
Choose your thoughts carefully. Keep what brings you peace and let go of what doesn't. Happiness is only one thought away.
Positive thoughts and feelings are what make your happiness. You are in control of your happiness, always.
Surround yourself with positive people who will support you during your bad days, not just your good ones.

Made some new friends today in New Orleans! @ Bourbon Street https://t.co/7iqNCDaLSj
Respect your friends decision. You don't have to agree with them. It's their life. But love them anyway.
Do what you think is right, not what people think is right. In the end, it's you who goes through it, not them.
You don't need a new day to start over, you only need a new mindset.

Some people cross your path and change your whole direction.
Understand your worth. Value your life. Appreciate your blessings.
@BenoUdrih1 you'll be missed in Memphis!
Some people cross your path and change your whole direction.
It doesn't matter whether you need them or not, just treat people right.
Don't miss out on something that could be amazing just because it could also be difficult.
No matter how hard you try, you can never please everyone. Follow your heart, make the most of every day and be proud of who you are.

Never think that what you have to offer is insignificant. There will always be someone out there that needs what you have to give.

It's okay to be scared, but you have to get out there, open up, love, make mistakes, learn, be stronger and start all over again.
Way to go @memgrizz!  https://t.co/ESXej2DvDA
You can't change what happened today. But you can make peace with it. Learn the lessons it came to teach, and try again tomorrow.

It's official.... @lziegs and I will be running a @ToughMudder to ring in her 21st birthday!
Life is too short to argue and fight with the past. Count your blessings, value your loved ones and move on with your head held high.
The greatest challenge in life is discovering who you are. The second greatest is being happy with what you find.
Enjoy every single moment. The good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the inspiring, the not so glamorous. And thank God through it all.
Always find time for the things that make you feel happy to be alive.
Luck is taking a chance when you have no choice. Destiny is making a choice when given the chance.
This past weekend was nice walking weather. #Laiken #MrBrown https://t.co/4VSzKJrbwg

Trust your gut. Your gut feelings are usually accurate and correct. If you truly feel there's something, chances are there is.
Life takes us to unexpected places sometimes. The future is never set in stone. Remember that.

If you've never watched the game show #Idiotest, please do yourself a favor and tune in.
Be thankful for what you are now, and keep fighting for what you want to be tomorrow.
People don't always need advice. Sometimes all they really need is a hand to hold, an ear to listen, and a heart to understand them.
I think it's safe to say Lyla Cate is starting to like skating. http://t.co/0YwaHgarJm
Sometimes, the most ordinary things can be made extraordinary, simply by doing them with the right people.
Never apologize for being sensitive or emotional. It's a sign that you have a big heart and aren't afraid to let others see it.
Do not chase people. Work hard and be you. The right people who belong in your life will come find you and stay.
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

If you are wise you will value your friends and make sure to keep them throughout your life.
People may not always tell you how they feel about you, but they will always show you. Pay attention.
Sometimes it takes losing everything you thought you needed to gain everything you ever wanted.
Keep the faith. The most amazing things in life tend to happen right at the moment you're about to give up hope.
Behind you are the challenges you've met. Before you lies new possibilities. Today you choose the direction of your life.

If you are passionate about something, pursue it, no matter what anyone else thinks. That's how dreams are achieved.

You can't spell challenge without change. If you're going to rise to the challenge, you have to be prepared to change.
Allow yourself small victories. Don't deny giving yourself credit for accomplishing something, no matter how insignificant it may seem.
Forgive yourself for your own mistakes. Because we all make them and they do not define you.
Life takes us to unexpected places sometimes. The future is never set in stone. Remember that.

Just remember this... weird's good. Embrace the weird. Enjoy it because it's never going away.
Trust your instincts. If it feels right then it must be. Everything can deceive but your conscience will always keep it real with you.
Becoming fearless isn't the point. That's impossible. It's learning how to control your fear, and how to be free from it.
You can't just hope for happy endings. You have to believe in them. Then do the work, take the risks.

Know when you bite your tongue. Just because you have opinions doesn't mean everyone needs to hear them.
Learn to appreciate the person you are, and all of the beautiful things you have to offer the world.
If life only teaches you one thing, let it be that taking a passionate leap is always worth it.

Life's two most important questions are "Why?" And "Why not?" The trick is knowing which one to ask.
For circumstances out of your control, keep your mindset &amp; attitude in check. Always look for ways to use challenges to your advantage.

Can't wait Grizz game bc at dinner w/ family after nieces dance recital so obvi dad &amp; I are watching live updates via ESPN app. #GrizzNation
@ShoKashima all but I think one playoff series since 2010 I think. But it's usually a good series when they play each other too.
@ShoKashima also.. ive said since before playoffs began.. If Grizzlies can't win it, I hope Thunder do. Would like to see Durant get a ring.
@ShoKashima yeah, the whole team was off last game. And I agree... I hope it's atleast a game worth watching, although I'll miss most if it
@ShoKashima chipotle is always good! And def a bummer, but that's how she rolls. we've played well without him before.

Sometimes you have to stop thinking so much and just go where your heart takes you.
You can't control much in life, but you can control how you treat people. Treat others with kindness, despite how they treat you.
Love people with all your heart. Because it's the best thing we can do in this lifetime.

Count your blessings, not your problems. When things go wrong, remind yourself that you have a greater purpose in life.
Thought once I was back home I wouldn't talk to my family as much on the phone; turns out I talk to them more. Even though I see them daily.

When you are humble, you are teachable. When you are teachable, you never cease to learn. To learn is to grow. Growing is the point of life.
I love to read... But it's a problem when I get so drawn into the book that I don't wanna go to bed when I need to bc I wanna keep reading.
In order to move forward, one should also take two steps back and look at the bigger picture ahead.

Experience, growth and the will to 'try' is far greater than the ability to shut down every time you're scared and want to play it safe.
Listen to what your gut tells you. Don't second guess yourself. Second guessing is overthinking. Go with your first thought, whatever it is.
Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen.

Sometimes you have to stop worrying and have faith that things will work out. Maybe not how you planned, but just how they're supposed to.
Found my entertainment today for my last few days in SLC before I head home... Sad this is the last season. #house http://t.co/cmiddOqYeo
Find your passion in life. Find and enjoy the things you want to do that make the things you must do worthwhile.
It's better to know and be disappointed than to never know and always wonder.

Conversations like this are why we are friends. #always @lziegs http://t.co/QGi73oNRL8
Everyone comes into your life for a reason; some good, some bad. They shape, form and break us. But in the end makes us who we are.
"God I hate you today. That sounded awful; it sounded funnier in my head." - @lziegs Thanks friend. So kind. #always #WhyWeAreFriends
Don't give up on your dream because it's not going in the direction you want. There are different routes to the same destination.
You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.
Treat every day as a gift, because that's exactly what it is, never take it for granted.
If you work hard enough, you can get whatever you want. It's just a matter of wanting the right things.
I have the best parents anyone could ask for! Wouldn't be where I am without them. #family #love http://t.co/I88KKUcgD2

In Palm Springs! Now just waiting on my mom and dad to get here.
It's nice to know if anything serious were to happen my SLC fam would be there in no time to help. Couldn't ask for better neighbors/friends
@Ali_McBeal_ @whitneyannwood love y'all both! üòä‚ù§
The secret of being happy is accepting where you are in life and making the most out of everyday.
Happy Valentines Day everyone! My Valentine @lziegs has made sure mine started off with a bang, but it's alright bc I still love her. #BFF
There's a big difference between settling and being truly happy. Life is short, never settle for less than you deserve.

"Cause we don't know what we got until it's gone, like it or not you live on love, you try to do what's right"

It's been awesome having our sports nutritionist on this trip with us. She is the best! Always keeps us fueled. #Sochi #TeamUSA #WErUSS
Group chats are pretty great... Especially when away in Russia. @lziegs @Ali_McBeal_ @WhitneyAnnWood
The moment you are ready to quit is usually the moment right before a miracle happens. Don't give up.
Made it to Sochi! A long day of travel, but excited to be here. Looking forward to seeing the short track and all the other venues.
Thanks @WhitneyAnnWood and @Ali_McBeal_ for getting up and giving @thejeffsimon and I a ride to the airport. See y'all in two weeks!
And the trip begins. Headed to the airport to meet up with the team. Then off to #Sochi!
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
The moment you stop chasing happiness, you become happy.
"Even if the laps are terrible today, it's ok because your socks are awesome." Thanks for the motivation Curtis!
It's not about who or what you know in this world, it's about being a good person and having respect for others.
Motivation for training... Don't worry my #BFF has it covered. @lziegs love you! http://t.co/j9LT6SL5
People are going to talk, whether you are doing good or bad. Worry about yourself before you worry about what others think.
‚Äú@lziegs: Truer than true #Grey #Yang @speedchic428 http://t.co/AONjOZDz‚Äù Agreed!
There is no reason to look back when you have so much to look forward to!
Never underestimate yourself or your abilities. Errors are stepping stones that will take you from where you are to where you want to be.
My mom and I FaceTime'd my niece earlier today and she sang 'Call Me Maybe' for us... Haha
Even when it's hard to move, take small steps forward. Because every step will lead you farther away from where you were yesterday.
My mom is here!!
Remember there are no mistakes, only lessons. Love yourself, trust your choices, and everything is possible.
To change your life, you have to change yourself. To change yourself, you have to change your mindset.
@lziegs I redid that reflection last night and some of my answers have already changed from the end of summer.
This is true... @lziegs I'm sure many people who see us together think this.. http://t.co/zpgETTMC
It's the rule of life... Everything you have always wanted comes the very second you stop looking for it.
What are best friends for if not for a sweet tattoo like this.. .Apparently trying to explain our life style. @lziegs http://t.co/o0lzAMpt
It's strange how you can not see or talk to someone for a long time, but when you see them again things pick up right where they left off.
"I knew she would be back. That's my psychic powers at work..." -- @lziegs
If you have to keep wondering where you stand with someone, it might be time to stop standing and start walking.
A good life is when you assume nothing, do more, need less, smile often, dream big, laugh a lot, and realize how blessed you are.
"My hips don't lie, I'm pretty sure this isn't a size 6 jean... Yeah def not a size 6. The body and mind will surprise you." -- @lziegs
Wishing everyone a safe and Happy New Year! Start a new chapter in your book and live it the way you want.

You are only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with so be brave enough to let go of those who keep weighing you down.

US Championships start tomorrow. Will be a good, fun weekend of racing! Then home for Christmas with the fam on Sunday.
Motivation. Determination. Confidence. Three things you need to be successful in life.
Happy are the ones who take life day by day, complain very little, and are thankful for the little things in life.

"Lord give me patience because if you give me strength I'll need bail money to go along with it." @lziegs
@HeadStrongDoc Happiest Birthday!! Hope it's a great day.
Never get so caught up in someone else's life that you forget to live your own. Always be yourself, not who someone else wants you to be.
You have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars and change the world. -Harriet Tubman
One ice session done for the day. A meeting with @underarmour and lunch. Then another ice session, followed by dryland. And finally done!
@lziegs hahaha.. YES! Think this is the best compliment ever. Thanks @travisjayner !
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.
Be thankful for the bad things in life. They open your eyes to the good things you were not paying attention to before.
@hendrixdanielle I've actually been alright coming back. Been sleeping a lot at night but still pretty tired through the day.
So nice to be back home and in my own bed with the best cuddle bud you could ask for. http://t.co/X93pNMMs

@RickSwansonNY thanks! I'm just along for the ride and Starbucks!... Haha
Already heading out black Friday shopping with my mom and sister in laws! Let's see what goodies we come away with after the night.
‚Äú@Rhodes411: When someone has a nickname, calling them by their real name just doesn't sound right.‚Äù @lziegs

One more practice then a few much needed days off after two and a half weeks of hard training. Can't wait for Thanksgiving and then Japan.
Life becomes so much better when you decide not to care. Just live for the moment and do not let the drama bring you down.
What a great Sunday! Church, chipotle for lunch and now watching Twilight Break Dawn 2 with @lziegs and @Ali_McBeal_
At first glance it may appear too hard. Look again. Always look again.
@SladeBivins it's actually a mix we took from our neighbor. It's a boxed mix but they are delish!
Breakfast for dinner for the second time this week. Making apple streusel pancakes with @lziegs
Getting out the Christmas decorations and listening to Christmas music with @lziegs. Love the Holiday season.
You come across many roadblocks in life. Do you stop and wait for them to be moved or do you find another path to get you around?
Relaxing and watching the @memgrizz game. Let's go Grizz!
Another tough day of training in the books. Things are starting to come together. Still some time to go!
Laughter is timeless, imagination has no age, dreams are forever. -Walt Disney
@John95Henry about time!
Maybe you'll get everything you wished for. Maybe you'll get more than you ever could imagine. Who knows where life will take you.
A big day of training at the @UtahOlympicOval today. Got in a good amount of Laps and dryland. Finishing up the day with dinner at ihop!
Heading to the @UtahOlympicOval to get this week of training kicked off with an ice and dryland session.
The journey in between what you once were and who you are becoming is where the dance of life really takes place.
Spending the morning at Capital Church! Working with kids ministry, attending service and then a lunch meeting.
@lziegs good thing you have one so no worries! http://t.co/GGJGknTq
Watching Bridesmaids at the neighbors with @lziegs. Could cite and act out this whole movie... It's the greatest!
Winter has arrived!! Yesterday is was 70 and today the ground is covered and snow is still coming down.
Cool Runnings means peace be the journey.
Watching Cool Runnings with @lziegs. It's a great, motivational movie that gives you a good laugh. It's been a while since I last saw it.
@Wheels29 training is going well! Just got back from 2 world cups in Canada. It def isn't the same as NMU.. And I do miss MQT!
Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear. #havehope
Miracles start to happen when you give as much energy to your dreams as you do to your fears.
No matter how busy your life may seem always take a moment to reflect on the beauty of the world around you.
Rested and ready for the tough week of training ahead. Time to put in the work.
Showing respect is a gift. One that costs nothing and is endlessly appreciated.
Have had a shadow since I got home Monday afternoon.. But it's def one happy pup! http://t.co/Y6hGeCZK
Good first ice session this afternoon back at the #utaholympicoval. Felt good to be back on skates after a few days off.

It's good to be back in the states. Can't wait to get home to my pup later this afternoon.
Still 2 days left of World Cup #2. Already looking forward to getting back to training when we get home.
Last practice day before the start of World Cup #2. Off for a little dryland session and skating later. Double 500m's this weekend.
Heading out for a jog in the park with a few teammates and staff! Love Montreal. World Cup 2 this weekend.
Strength shows not only in the ability to persist, but the ability to start over.
You cannot always wait for the perfect time, sometimes you must dare to jump.
Survived another haunted house tonight.. Nightmare on 13th! With @lziegs @Ali_McBeal_ @WhitneyAnnWood

Roaming around Spirit Halloween store with @lziegs ! What kind of costumes can we come up with to try on is the question?!
It's not about who is real to your face, it's about who stays real behind your back.
Cooking dinner with @lziegs and @KellyAGunther ! Baked spaghetti in garlic bread and apple enchiladas!

Haunted house time!! With @lziegs @Ali_McBeal_ @WhitneyAnnWood @TophCrev @kspeedskata
What to do on a lazy Saturday afternoon? Finish season 8 of Grey's Anatomy = watching 7 episodes in a row. Marking things of the bucket list
At the end of the day, you can focus on what's tearing you apart or what's holding you together.
What to do when @lziegs wants to do something but doesn't know what on a Friday night? Make edible cookie dough and watch Greys Anatomy.
Going to pick Mr Brown up from the vet. Hope he feels better now.
We don't meet people by accident. They are meant to cross our paths for a reason.
Cleaned the house and now playing board games with @lziegs and the neighbor.
I'm going to be an Aunt again!! üòÉ‚ù§
The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.
It takes sadness to know what happiness is, noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence.
It's nice going to bed knowing I don't have to set an alarm for the morning.
It's been a good two days of racing and still two more to go. It's a long competition and a lot of racing still left.
‚Äú@John95Henry: Wish my team all the luck in the world. We have been through so much this summer and have a lot to skate for. FIGHTING:)‚Äù
Heading to the Oval for last practice &amp; final preparation before the new seasons first trials start tomorrow!
You have the patience, strength and passion to achieve your ambitions, goals and dreams. All you need to do now is try!
Baking adventure #1 for the week with @lziegs a success! Key lime cheesecake cupcakes... Delish! http://t.co/t2Pne27Y
Cooked roast, potatoes &amp; carrots for dinner &amp; had a neighbor family dinner tonight &amp; now baking adventures w/ @lziegs http://t.co/O2DJvzfb
Imagine with all your mind. Believe with all your heart. Achieve with all your might.
Thank you for the extra motivation for final preparation coming into the racing season and for trials!
My attitude is if u push me towards something u think is a weakness then I will turn that perceived weakness into a strength.-Michael Jordan
People change for one of two reasons: either they have learned enough that they want to or they have been hurt enough that they have to.
Most of the problems in life are because of two reasons: we act without thinking or we keep thinking without acting.
The number 1 reason why people give up so fast is bc they tend to look at how far they still have to go instead of how far they have gotten.
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't.
@John95Henry don't hate!!
It's your road and yours alone. Others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you.
@lziegs we can always do breakfast for dinner tonight!!
Just because something isn't happening for you now doesn't mean that it will never happen. #KeepBelieving
Beautiful weather. #SLC #mountains http://t.co/9HEt4Op3
All you have to do is be yourself &amp; live the story no one else can live - the story of your own life. Be proud, be confident &amp; be happy!
‚Äú@lziegs: Reason #18382‚Äù gotta love dance parties with the neighbors, kids and grandkids!!
You are always responsible for how you act, no matter how you feel. Remember that.
It was a long day of training, but we made it through all the workouts in a row. Finished the day up with a team long track session!
Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have.
@ApoloOhno what powers does this silver speedster consist of??!
Gotta love getting woken up at 6:30 for drug testing...
Sitting outside at night w/ the neighbors &amp; @lziegs talking about ghost stories, haunted houses &amp; scary movies. Always a great time!
People will always have their opinion of you despite who you are and what you are capable of.
@lziegs don't hate..
And this is why we are friends... Out for our nightly walk/stretch! @lziegs http://t.co/S3V5stTy
You will always be faced with problems in life. If you can handle it well, it will make you stronger.

Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and offer thanks for all the troubles we don't have.
@RickSwansonNY thanks! Yes it is kinda crazy it's so quick but have to keep using eye drops and wear sunglasses outside for a the next bit.
Headed back to SLC. It's been a great few days in NYC. Thanks again to Dr Pamel! Two more rest days then back to training.
Wow... What an amazing feeling to wake up and be able to see without having to put on glasses or contacts! Thanks again to Dr Pamel! :)
@lziegs thanks sister!! :)
Quick stop in times square this morning. Now off to central park for a little workout and shoot. Then surgery later this afternoon.
Perhaps strength doesn't reside in having never been broken... But in the courage required to grow strong in the broken places.
Thank you to Dr Gregory Pamel for making this amazing life changing opportunity available to us athletes! Tmrw=no more contacts or glasses!
Gotta love adventures! Heading to World Trade Center Memorial and then Chinatown. Later a workout in Central Park.

A few things to get done today then a red eye flight to NYC tonight!! Can't wait.

Just keep swimming!!... üê†üêüüê≥üê¨üåä
Today will never come again. Be a blessing, be a friend. Encourage someone. Take time to care. Let your words heal and not wound.
@babybloomer09 hahahah... Thanks for the laugh!
@lziegs @kellyagunther my question is this.... Should this really surprise me at all?! What kind of trouble have you two managed to cause?
‚Äú@Rhodes411: Having 1 of those weird conversations with someone &amp; thinking, if anyone heard us right now, they'd think we're crazy.‚Äù @lziegs
@followingApolo thank you! Training is going well.
@followingApolo I am getting LASIK the week of break. That's why I have to wear my glasses all day.
Hardest part of the week will be remembering I can only wear my contacts during skating and glasses the rest of the day.
In the last week of summer training then a week break! Gonna be a long, tough week but should be a good one. Time to do work!
Love Sundays!! Always a great day. Good church service, a nap, &amp; a night with the girls @lziegs &amp; @KellyAGunther &amp; a thunderstorm to end it
@KellyAGunther yeah Jef!!!! #TheBachelorette
If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you.
In life you will meet two kinds of people. Ones who build you up and ones who tear you down. But in the end you will thank them both.
You know it's going to be a good day when @John95Henry tells you he is unfollowing you on twitter because of practice.
@John95Henry we don't have Shane's warm up tmrw but can still play frisbee if it'll make you happy. :)
Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you.
Never regret anything that has happened in your life, it cannot be changed, undone, or forgotten. Take it as a lesson learned and move on.
2 more weeks of training for summer then week break! Let's make it a good two weeks @TheJessicaSmith @LanaGehring1 @John95Henry @TophCrev
"When I think that laugh I laugh that laugh...." -- @lziegs at dinner with @babybloomer09 @KellyAGunther
Love Sundays! Chocolate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast, Church and then lunch with the girls. :)
Respect people who find time for you in their busy schedule. But love people who never look at their schedule when you need them.
Love listening to the sound of rain! Definitely relaxing. And the best weather for a good nights rest.
One more team training session for the week and then tomorrow is OYO! Making it a good finish for a weekend of rest.
To live a happy life live for a purpose. Do not live for someone or something to be your happiness. Make your own happiness.
Keep your head high, keep your chin up, &amp; most importantly, keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing &amp; theres so much to smile about.
Baking adventures with @lziegs = the best!
Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can't change.
Fireworks last night with @lziegs @babybloomer09 @John95Henry &amp; Cole. This is one of my faves! http://t.co/27N9YruS
"The rain can stop the wildfires, but it can't stop us." -- @LanaGehring1
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life.
Happy 4th of July! Hope it's a safe holiday for you all and spent with people you care about. #IndependenceDay #HappyBirthdayAmerica
Only going up...
Most of your accomplishments in life are based on the confidence you have in yourself. Always believe you can reach your goals.
8 rules to a better life: never hate, don't worry, live simply, expect a little, give a lot, always smile, live with love, be with God!
Enjoying this Sunday. Chocolate chip pancake breakfast, Church, lunch at Cracker Barrel, and pool time. Great weather and great company!
@LanaGehring1 Welcome to the twitter world! :)
@lziegs ...ignored for a bit but the milkshake was worth it! http://t.co/QzFA7jkG
@Chris_Lenahen I know!! I missed out this year. How's MQT? I miss bein up there.
Busy day... Good training this AM, Chicfila with the team, house cleaned, garage more cleaned out, errands done and now to relax for a bit.
Great Sunday so far! Church and Cracker Barrel w/ @lziegs &amp; @KellyAGunther then gave pup a bath and now Grey's Anatomy!
@KellyAGunther what are you doing tonight?!
@babybloomer09 you will be here soon! And in the same development. And don't worry we have scary movies for movie night! :)
Just a casual Saturday night at walmart with @lziegs http://t.co/lDTep8LH
@babybloomer09 @lziegs wants to know if anything has become a missile yet?!
@babybloomer09 Yes please... @lziegs and I are in!! Hurry up and get here please! :)
Take it day by day. Results don't come overnight. Change doesn't happen immediately. Keep working towards your goals.
If you don't like the road you are walking, then start paving another one. Always keep your goals in mind and have faith you can reach them!
Tough but good day of training today. Picking up @lziegs at the airport now. Then dinner at Rumbis and game 4 of #NBAFinals.
Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going. Make a habit out of working out! It gets easier as you go.
At #24hourfitness starting this Saturday of with a spin class!
@lziegs @babybloomer09 Mr Brown is looking forward to meeting y'all! http://t.co/DrcitheV
@babybloomer09 @lziegs @kspeedskata @tophcrev hahahah.. YES! This is true. And of course can't forget @J2K111
Excited for the #NBAFinals to start tonight. Which team are you cheering for?
Do not chase people. Be you and do your own thing and work hard. The right people who belong in your life will come to you and stay.
Life is short, live it. Live is rare, grab it. Anger is bad, dump it. Fear is awful, face it. Memories are sweet, cherish it.
Positive thinking evokes more energy, more initiative and more happiness. Keep your head up and follow your dreams!
Gotta love this view! http://t.co/pgA3v6fJ
@SladeBivins that is a very true statement! Something I think about often in training.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right.
Sign up for uncovet today! http://t.co/DrqeCTpC via @uncovet
Looking forward to another week of training and being on the ice. It's gonna be a good week. Great to be back in Utah.
@RickSwansonNY I have already downloaded this one on my kindle for a book to read! Will be a good inspirational book for sure.
Love having my pup back! Best cuddle buddy ever. http://t.co/cjwTFTU2
Thanks for all the book suggestions. Def going to look into all of them. Love reading and I enjoy all books!
Looking for some great books for summer reading. Suggestions?
If you're always racing to the next moment, what happens to the one you are in? Take the time to enjoy the ride!!
The way you treat yourself sets the standard for others on how you demand to be treated. Don't settle for anything other than respect.
@babybloomer09 do you know when you are heading this way yet??
When you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you.
Welcome the unexpected in life. Learn to bend w/ grace. Let yourself grow. Be humble &amp; never forget to look for the beauty changes can bring
"It's impossible" said pride. "It's risky" said experience. "It's pointless" said reason. "Give it a try" whispered the heart.
@travisjayner which team are you for?
Reunited with the pup! http://t.co/VOaqVEsa
Heading to the airport to pick up my mom and Mr Brown! :)
@backtothesouth Yes! It's a great book. I read it when it first came out and rereading it now.
Brick walls are there for a reason. They give us a chance to show how badly we want something.
Eventually all pieces fall into place. Until then, laugh at the confusion, live for the moment and know that everything happens for a reason
@KellyAGunther here is one of the throwback pics i have! 2001 style hahaha http://t.co/PSxdEcbD
@KellyAGunther it's actually a really good picture! It's of when your mom rented to limo and I have one of the whole team at junior banquet!
@KellyAGunther I have a nice throwback pic of us on my computer! It's from the summer we made our first junior team haha
Watching 'The Devil Inside' with @kspeedskata @TophCrev @thejeffsimon
‚Äú@UberFacts: Crows can recognize human faces and warn other crows about dangerous people.‚Äù y'all better watch out @lziegs @babybloomer09
@babybloomer09 @yed_z haha.. Momma's passenger door is good. Sounds like an interesting dream.
If you could see yourself right now in the eyes of someone else, what would you say to yourself?
Starting this beautiful Sunday morning off with a vanilla caramel latte and some chocolate chip pancakes!
It's so nice to be in a place where I can cook again!!
@JaredZiggy i love how you took over your sisters dog! @lziegs
Accept your past without regrets. Handle your present with confidence. Face your future without fear.
Don't be afraid to love yourself, have the courage to live your life your way, and never be afraid to speak the truth.
@lziegs @jaredziggy Yed... I'm impressed with the gift. You did a good job!
@lziegs nice work sister!! Now you can celebrate your birthday! :)
@lziegs good song! Almost there. Only a few days! :)
Miracles start to happen when you give as much energy to your dreams as you do to your fears.
@babybloomer09 looks good! Glad to see the baking skills are getting better. Probs bc you don't have @lziegs to mess it up for ya.. Haha
It's good to be back in SLC. Finishing getting settled in and catching up on rest. Back to training in the AM!
@_Hawke_ thanks!! Hope you are enjoying home and things are going well.
MQT to SLC = 1,761 miles = DONE! 27 hours of driving. #newhome
On the road driving back out to SLC with my mom. It's a long drive, but we are cruisin' along pretty good. Excited to be back with the team.
Last night in MQT. Headed out early in the AM to start the drive to SLC. Picking my mom up in MKE. Glad to see @shelbie_serpan tonight!
Life's like a camera, focus on whats important &amp; capture the good times, develop from negatives &amp; if things dont work out take another shot.
You decide every moment of every day who you are and what you believe in. You get a second chance, every second.
"That's what happens when you roll with the big boys." - @lziegs
@TophCrev safe travels! Hope the trip goes smooth.. See ya in a few days! :)
Watching impractical jokers with @lziegs . If ya haven't seen this show you should tune in. Hilarious.
Words are just that... Words. Action is what proves your words are true, that you actually mean what you say. #actionspeakslouderthanwords
Down to my last week in MQT. Finals, packing and goodbyes all to come. Gonna be a busy week.
Difficult does not mean impossible. It simply means that you have to work hard.
@soulcold_redux thank you for the birthday wishes!
Never expect, never assume, never ask and never demand. Just let it be. Because if it is meant to be, it will happen.
Going to hike Sugarloaf to watch the sunset. Then to Culver's for ice cream with @lziegs @babybloomer09 @shelbie_serpan
@SladeBivins hmm.. That sounds good. I usually go with a vanilla latte or cinnamon dolce latte.
‚Äú@Rhodes411: Laughing even harder when you try to explain why you're laughing hard.‚Äù @lziegs @babybloomer09
Out of class early. Grabbing some Starbucks then back to the books and lesson plan writing.
Good thing my parents are the best and sent me a care package w/ snacks to help get through the next week and a half! http://t.co/z4Vj9ye4

Here ya go @lziegs ...‚Äú@UberFacts: You can call the Hunger Games hotline  (404) 698-2903, and actually participate in the game!‚Äù
Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who look inside, awakens.
@alydudek @travisjayner awesome! Great books and the movie was awesome too.
"I believe I'm here for a reason and my purpose is greater than my challenges." Always have faith in yourself.
@lziegs New life motto: Beat N Cheat!
Ahh.. Love that movie! :) ‚Äú@KellyAGunther: I'll never forget watching 8 seconds as a kid with @speedchic428 best movie EVER!!! (:‚Äù
The words you choose to say something are just as important as the decision to speak. Choose your words wisely.
A view from the op of Sugarloaf. Gonna miss MQT. http://t.co/wQjYpdBC
Going out to enjoy the beautiful weather. Hiking Sugarloaf with @lziegs and @babybloomer09
We would do well to slow down a little focus on the significant and truly see the things that matter most.
It's okay to make mistakes. Remember, life didn't come with instructions. Just learn from your mistakes so you know what works and doesn't.
It's the hardest times that teach us the most valuable lessons.
Because when you stop and look around, this life is pretty amazing.
Had a great visit at home. Back in classes now to finish out the semester. 2 1/2 weeks of class left plus finals. Only 25 days left in MQT.
@babybloomer09 nap time!! Happy Easter!.. See y'all tomorrow.

The future has many names:for the weak means the unattainable. For the fearful it means the unknown. For the courageous it means opportunity
A few days of class to get through.. One exam, one paper, some daycare time and then heading home to spend Easter with the fam! #Thursday
Sometimes you need to step outside, get some air, and remind yourself of who you are and who you want to be.
Happy April Fools everyone! I hope if you get pranked you take it with a grain of salt and laugh it off.. http://t.co/kDxDl73B
Just because something isn't happening for you right now doesn't mean it will never happen.
let's go OSU! ‚Äú@HeadStrongDoc: Go Buckeyes! @espn: Hello, Saturday. Thanks for the evening plans. #FinalFour‚Äù
Always remember to smile. Because your smile will brighten someone else's day.
At the Upfront hanging out with @TophCrev @kspeedskata ...band starts soon.
Choose your friends with caution, plan your future with purpose, and frame your life with faith.
@SladeBivins that is true.. Sometimes you have to look for help but any obstacle can strengthen you if you look at it correctly.
Your strength will always be tested. You have to see each setback as an opportunity to become stronger.
HAHAHAHA.. this made me think of you! :) @babybloomer09 http://t.co/3ovDfEvr
Hope is the compass that leads way as we navigate the trials& hardships of life by which we discover the strength&courage that reside within
Me too! ‚Äú@jrcelski: Getting real excited for the Summer @olympics, ready to see the USA on top of that medal count again. #beastmode‚Äù
You can't get anywhere in three seconds... You're setting me up for lose already.
Study break to take a stroll to the wright place for snacks with @lziegs and @kspeedskata
"There are 2 ways you can go with pain. You can let it destroy you or you can use it as fuel to drive you; to dream bigger, work harder."
We know too well what were doing is nothing more than a drop in the ocean. But if the drop werent there the ocean would be missing something
@kspeedskata what do u mean?!.. Serious face is the easiest one to make and keep.. Haha. Now mean face is a hard one.. Ask @TophCrev
Don't wake up thinking you can't do it. Wake up knowing you can. You can be your worst enemy or your best friend.
Got some decent school work done today.. Quiz complete and lesson plan in progress. Taking a study break now to watch Jack &amp; Jill.
"The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present."
Be strong when you are weak, brave when you are scared, and humble when you are victorious.
Trials are not a reason to give up but a challenge to improve ourselves. Our pain is not an excuse to back out but an inspiration to move on
May the odds be ever in your favor. Headed to watch The Hunger Games with @lziegs @babybloomer09 @TophCrev @kspeedskata #district12
Grabbing some Starbucks then off to class. Going into the daycare for a couple hours this afternoon. Hunger Games tonight!
You can break down a woman temporarily, but a real woman will always pick up the pieces, rebuild herself, and come back stronger than ever.
Four things you can't recover: the stone after the throw, the word after its said, the occasion after its missed, the time after its gone.
The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do.
Never let the things you want make you forget the things you love.
@kspeedskata @lziegs we need to get tickets today!! #hungergames
The offseason just started but this amazing weather in MQT makes me want to run.
@lziegs I'm gonna say around 11:45ish... She has class at noon.
Peace: not the absence of noise, trouble or hard work. But to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart.
@Andi_Kelly @peggyaitken Thank you! :)
Road trippin back to MQT with @babybloomer09 @lziegs good end to the season. Dr Pepper and twizzlers ready and a stop at DQ!
Last day of the season.. Let's go team! #tonerangers forever... @lziegs @kspeedskata @TophCrev @babybloomer09 @BarrywWinslow Gonna miss MQT!
@TophCrev anytime Toph!
Yep... I'd say this is true for us. @lziegs @kspeedskata @babybloomer09 http://t.co/wSJRRS61
Sometimes you have to stop worrying wondering &amp; doubting. Have faith things will work out maybe not how you planned but how it's meant to be
How others see you is not important... How you see yourself means everything.
One new perception, one fresh thought, one act of surrender, one change of heart, one leap of faith, can change your life forever.
Nice, quick, easy road trip to Green Bay with @lziegs and @babybloomer09 . Now grabbing dinner at Old Chicago!
@SladeBivins I know.. I love mqt summers. Def gonna miss the beach. Don't see those much in the desert... Haha

Last practice in MQT. Will miss this place. Green Bay this afternoon after school. #lovemqt
@Apolo4CelebAppr haha.. Thanks! I wish I had time to play but being a full time student and doing some training doesn't allow time.
@Apolo4CelebAppr I have been training.. Just not as serious. Will get back to it in May. Took some time for school.
@travisjayner thanks! Good work last weekend. See you in May!
Busy day.. Practice, breakfast, class, lunch, 2hrs at daycare, practice, dinner, study for exam and get ready to head to Green Bay tmrw.
@13951rob hahah.. My car.
Its hard to wait around for something you know might never happen; but it's even harder to give up when you think its everything you want.
Woke up to a beautiful day in MQT. 50s and sunny. Starting the day off with 3rd Street Bagel, giving Momma a wash, and possibly a run later.
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
To succeed in life you need 3 things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funnybone.
When you have to make a hard decision, flip a coin. Because when that coin is in the air you will suddenly know what you are hoping for.
‚ÄúThe hardest job in the world would be working in a bubble wrap factory. Just imagine the self control that is required!‚Äù @babybloomer09
Morning practice is done. Now off to the Y daycare to play with some kids! Always a fun time.
Sometimes the best thing u can do is not think, wonder, imagine, or obsess. Just breathe & have faith everything will work out for the best.
Just got a plane ticket home for Easter weekend!!! :)
Are any of you excited for The Hunger Games movie? I am!... Rereading the first book of the series while on spring break this week.
In order to succeed your desire for success has to be greater than your fear of failure.
Got one bag packed up of things I don't need at the moment... Quite a bit to go but still some time. Now time to watch Casablanca.
"You is kind. You is smart. You is important." watching 'The Help' with @babybloomer09 @lziegs
Everything in your life is a reflection of a choice you have made. If you want a different result.. Make a different choice.
Love that we cannot have is the one that lasts the longest, hurts the deepest, and feels the strongest.

Life is like a roller coaster... It has it's ups and downs, but it's your choice to scream or enjoy the ride.
It's your road and yours alone. Others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you.

Your attitude and the choices you make today will be your life tomorrow.
@SladeBivins haha.. Awesome! I watched it with some friends who had never heard of it.
@LeeLeeBwn thank you! I'm really enjoying what I'm learning in school and the field experience work im doing.
@LeeLeeBwn yeah... Early childhood education.
Happy to have turned in the lesson plan today for school. Spring Break now! Starting it by watching my all time favorite movie '8 Seconds'
Always stay true to yourself because there are very few people who will always be true to you.
Having fun and enjoying skating. Looking forward to things to come.
Strangers can become best friends just as easy as best friends can become strangers.
Watching one of my all time favorite movies, The Cutting Edge, while getting some school work done. Can't wait until Thursday.
@KellyAGunther what's your skype name?
Perhaps strength doesn't reside in having never been broken but in the courage required to grow strong in the broken places.

Sometimes what you don't want may turn out to be what you need. It may take a little while to realize, but true happiness can be found.
I feel as though a huge weight I didn't even realize was there has been lifted off my shoulders.
Looking at a situation from a different perspective can change your whole outlook and the outcome to follow.
Enjoying the beautiful weather in Marquette. When the sun is shining its always a good day. A busy week of school ahead.
@HeadStrongDoc I had to go through a few security pages and answer questions and reset my password then it worked.
@HeadStrongDoc I got that same message like an hour ago..
@babybloomer09 hahaha.. Aww you found Alvin's long lost cousin!
True strength is holding it together when everyone around you would understand if you fell apart.
@babybloomer09 I wish that were my problem.. Seeing as I am now being drug tested and we are just hanging out...
People are made to be loved and things are made to be used. The confusion in the world is people are used and things are loved.
‚Äú@MCretcher: Need to do some work today, I feel lazy‚Äù me too... I've been good at procrastinating today if not successful at anything else.
Took a couple days to recover from the travel and sickness. Now back on the grind of catching up with school.
Life has many way of testing a persons will. Either by having nothing happen at all or having everything happen all at once.
Back in the US! Long, but fun trip. Looking forward to getting back to #mqt in a couple hours!
@TophCrev I get in tonight at 9.... Can't wait. Already a long day. How do you like the iPhone?

@lziegs it would be an honor... Especially with a sweet box of chocolates like that.
Strength of character isnt always about how much you can handle before you break, its also about how much you can handle after youve broken.
Getting ready for a run through the icy cold streets of Dordrecht. Going in a different direction today.
@kspeedskata I sent you a request on skype!
If you really want something you can figure out how to make it happen.
@kspeedskata Kelso! Thanks.. Look forward to being back. It's already been a long trip. I told Zeigs we need to Skype sometime today or tmrw
@lziegs well both.. obvi! We should def Skype sometime. I am always signed in just not always by phone..
We made it to Dordrecht. Had a great layover yesterday in Copenhagen. Team adventure into town for a quick look.
@lziegs So make it to Holland.. And finally have tv in English... the first show we find is big bang theory!.. Thought of you.
Leaving Moscow... Onto the Netherlands with a quick stop in Copenhagen.

Great Christmas holiday at home with the family. Family time is always great! Looking forward to being back in 2 weeks.
On the flight.. heading out to UT. It'll be nice to be back on the skates after a few days off.
@babybloomer09 hahah.. That's funny. I am not the only one thinking like this I see.
@lziegs Thanks! On flight now. Maybe you'll receive a call from me, @kspeedskata and @TophCrev while we are out in UT
@BridgetNulty hey! I'm well. Traveling to UT today. How are you, the baby, and fam doing?
Actions speak louder than words.
Just heard #lifeisahighway by #rascalflatts on the radio.. Made me think of @lziegs @kspeedskata @babybloomer09
Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas!
@lziegs give her some of the cupcakes!
@kyleuyehara yeah.. I get out to Utah on the 27th
@lziegs @kspeedskata @babybloomer09 @TophCrev #Jeffy sat behind me on my flight out of #mqt this morning.
@babybloomer09 I got a checked bag free.. since I had a delta credit card! Although I don't think I was supposed to.. The guy gave it to me
On my way home! Excited to see the family.
@kspeedskata @lziegs @babybloomer09 HAHAHA.. this is so true. And we just talked about it. http://t.co/TplFvCy9
Our background and circumstances may influence who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.
Laughter is good for the soul.
Ready for our teams ugly sweater Christmas party and secret Santa! Heading out with the #gooftroop. http://t.co/jS4MQ5Qd
@emtgirl32 thanks! Merry Christmas to you as well!
If its something you truly care about then no matter how busy you are you will find a way to make time in your day.
Forget what hurt you in the past. Bit never forget what it taught you.
One week til I head home for a few days!!
Very true. ‚Äú@KellyAGunther: Don't love too much.. Don't care too much.. Don't hope too much.. Cause that too much will hurt you so much. &lt;3‚Äù
What does sacrifice mean to you?
Courage does not always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying "I will try again tomorrow."
Caramel br√ªl√©e latte from #Starbucks is my favorite holiday drink. What's yours?
Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.
Finals week. Exam at 10 and at 2. Then only a paper and online exam to get done this week.
In school you are taught a lesson and then given a test. In life you are given a test that teaches you a lesson.
@lziegs hahaha.. I think #Roxanne made a call for help
When something bad happens you have 3 choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.
Haha @lziegs thanks! tried to call on the phone. You must've been driving through the UP and no service bc no answer. http://t.co/jlfPcKMO
@lziegs hahahaha... Thanks for the laugh! #maggiewouldntapprove
You are free to choose, but you are not free from the consequence of your choice.
Always remember... Sometimes less is more.
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.
This is what happens when the  driver doesn't show up so we can't skate our actual practice. http://t.co/eVxb29UA
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.
People who know the least about you usually have the most to say about you.
@lziegs @kspeedskata @babybloomer09 @tophcrev hahaha.. Awesome.. good laugh. Her point was made.. Wonder how it worked out for dates.
Every day may not be good... But there is something good in every day.
Stay true to yourself because there are very few people who will always be true to you.
The past is like an anchor holding you back. You have to let go of who you are to become who you will be.
Give-don't allow yourself to be used Love-don't allow yourself to be abused Trust-don't be naive Listen to others-don't lose your own voice.
@lziegs hahaha.. Thanks for the laugh. #tr #FEmale
@jrcelski Favorite!! Good luck at the world cups... Cheering for ya. Do work! :)
@lziegs HAHAHA.. Thanks. I do what I can!
#blackfridayshopping for the first time ever with @AnthonyLobello @lziegs @babybloomer09. People are crazy.
I love pumpkin pie!
@emtgirl32 Happy Thanksgiving to you too! :)
@QuietPirate Happy Thanksgiving to you! Hope it's a day spent with friends and family for you!
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that's greater than any obstacle.
Four things you can't recover: the stone after the throw, the word after its said, the occasion after its missed, the time after its gone.
To succeed in life, you need three things. A wishbone, a backbone, and a funny bone
Today is already a good day... Good morning training done, exam completed, and my fave holiday drink is back at #starbucks !
There is no passion to be found in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. -Theodore Roosevelt
You can't please everyone and you can't make everyone like you.
Never let success get to your head. Never let failure get to your heart.
@lziegs HAHAHAHA... http://t.co/Fwgu9fbd
Always remember... You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.
@lziegs I feel the trust through this tweet... #goingpink
Take pride in how far you have come and have faith in how far you can go.
You're off to great places. Today is your day! You're mountain is waiting... So get on your way!
@kspeedskata @lziegs @babybloomer09 Can't approve of this living in my room.. but did lol! I found @lziegs pet though!! http://t.co/QbTvRtR9
@lziegs hahahaha... Classy!
@lziegs http://t.co/XeRjhFiK
It's crazy how you can do nice things for people all the time & they never notice, but once you make one mistake it's never forgotten.
Feelings are like waves... We can't stop them from coming but we can choose which one to surf.
Gotta love the first snow fall of the year. Many more to come for this season.
Funny how much you can find out about yourself from rumors & nonsense other people say. Interesting things you didn't know may come about.
Don't let anyone make a judgement for you... Take the time to make your own. The outcome may surprise you. #beyourownperson
@lziegs I'm sure you know but a reminder.. you have people around if you need anything!
Can't believe this weather is holding on like it is. Having a great fall in #mqt.
@SladeBivins thanks! Now time to get ready for US Champs in January!
@SladeBivins hahah.. That he def is. Kinda funny how this came from a movie and then there were crows everywhere for Halloween
@kspeedskata well since there is no crawl space available we will just hang out under you bed!!.. It's the next closest thing.
Thanks to my awesome friends for my new friend/pet, Alvin.. @kspeedskata @lziegs @babybloomer09 #marionwouldbeproud http://t.co/1eyor7QN
@lziegs @babybloomer09 I see how it is Lziegs.. You cancel our friendship out and then call me a hater...
@MCretcher Milk is for cows...
@lziegs " I think I would make a good leprechaun... "
Long day. Up at 5:30 at the rink at 6:10 until about 5:45. Drove back to #MQT arriving at 3:45 and now bed time. #awesometrip #exhausted
@lziegs you have been for 24 hrs so go to bed!! And after that trip I am not sure we can be friends any longer!.. That's all. Bye!
@kspeedskata @lziegs you can't get anywhere in 3 seconds.... you're setting me up for a lose already..
Halfway through the semester. A lot of work as been put in on and off the ice... Still a lot of work to be done. Looking forward to it!
@babybloomer09 @lziegs @kspeedskata I was thinking.... Alvin!
@lziegs @kspeedskata @babybloomer09 True... Crawl space is better but hard to come by. And the crow needs a name...
@lziegs @kspeedskata @babybloomer09 If you need me you can locate me.... Underneath the bed!
Play ball!!... Let's go Cardinals!
@lziegs @kspeedskata All the above sounds good to me! I'm sure you have some good stories after a brief talk I had earlier today.. Haha.
@SladeBivins I bet they are pretty crazy out there.. May have to take a ride over that way to check it out.
The north winds are blowing and winter will be here before we know it. http://t.co/DBzwIEfv
@kspeedskata @lziegs I'm right there with both of y'all... Not feeling it today.
@lziegs @kspeedskata uh oh... I'm sure it'll be something good. Can't wait to hear!.. Haha.
Understand yourself in order to better understand others.
@J2K111 hahah.. I guess it depends on who you ask! :)
What one person sees as junk another person sees as treasure.
@cocoforchel Would've loved to come but exam for school had to be done tonight and dog sitting. Not enough time to make the drive!
If you have the energy to wish for it, you have the energy to do it.

"This is 10% luck, 20% skill, 15% concentrated power of will, 5% pleasure, 50% pain and 100% reason to remember my name"
@jrcelski Looking forward to seeing you favorite!
@cheex32 Hero!.. I'm good. Just training and schooling. How are you?
"I don't need easy. I just need possible."
Always be sure to consider things from every angle. Don't jump ahead and make an assumption. Think everything through clearly.
@lziegs Glad you had fun inlining! You can borrow my skates anytime.
‚Äú@cocoforchel: @lziegs is Tilly #awesome‚Äù ...Wait... I have the play of the century!
@QuietPirate Thanks! Hope you have a great labor day weekend too! :)
@KellyAGunther I want to see a pic!!!
@Max_a_zillion I approve of this tweet..
"Those that dare to venture experience the greatest rewards."
"Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good."

The ultimate power is in decision making. It's not the event, but what you tell yourself about the event!

"It's not what happens to you, but how you react to what happens to you, that makes the difference."
@shorttrackHD haha... Good luck with that. Wasn't sure if ISU had rules against it or not.
