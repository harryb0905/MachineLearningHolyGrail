@snarkyboy13 I consider it to be augmenting the joke. But I guess you didn’t get that. Kind of… went over your head.

@AOC Dear @AOC. I truly hope you do not read your timeline. May I suggest you have a staffer screen it for you? As someone who knows, you are being bombarded by so many bots and trolls, real and manipulated, (see @natashakorecki @politico piece), you’ll have to really sift through.

@chrissyteigen @paulhollaholla Ah yes. And let’s not forget him calling me a “BALD DY*E” two days after my sister died of cancer and I’d shaved my head in solidarity. And “YOU FUC*IN C*NT” “WAR’S COMIN”.  So loud, my security camera caught it all on tape. That’s Jeffery T Mezger. The CEO of @kbhome
@paulhollaholla @chrissyteigen Hilarious. Oh fuck, I needed that laugh. I love your Dad.

KK) Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund Donation Link: https://t.co/KHAJKCtTgf
JJ) American Cancer Society Donation Link: https://t.co/Gfc7RpI2Sv
II) As my Dad would’ve said, “These types of guys have had a long run at this. Stand up, Dolly! If you can’t stand up for something, then sit down!” I choose to stand up. And I’m not shaking.
HH) …then I CAN sure as hell stand up to yet another powerful CEO who seems to feel emboldened enough to behave this way. I remember my Mom, Maggie telling me, “If you have to stand up to bullies Kathleen, do it, even if you’re shakin’ in your boots.”
GG) Look, if the White House, the Department of Justice, which investigated me for two months, and a continuing drum beat from the far right filled with threats of all kinds, hasn’t silenced me from telling my truth…
FF) You all have been so good to me, especially in this last year and seven months. I’m so grateful I got to do a genuine worldwide comedy tour, all because of you guys! I appreciate it more than you can ever know. I love you and thank you.
EE) IMHO, this isn’t about two people fighting over the size of the yard or a neighbor nuisance suit: it’s about intimidation. I’m standing up for the LGBTQ community, the cancer community and the respect I have for all women and girls everywhere and every place.
DD) In response, I have countersued the Mezgers. My Cross- Complaint states that I am seeking $50,001.00 in compensatory damages, of which $50,000 will be donated to the Times Up Legal Defense Fund and just $1 will go to me. One dollar.
CC) The Mezgers have “demanded a jury trial” which is scheduled for the Fall in LA Superior Court.
BB) Why did I play it? Hello? It’s part of my narrative. I’ve built a life and career based on telling stories ripped from my life, warts and all. Real and raw. To the best supporters in the world. This tape is as real as it gets.
AA) Jeffrey T. Mezger and Sandra Mezger filed this lawsuit the next day.
Z) Seven months later, on July 19, 2018, I exercised my First Amendment right again and played the full tape, the same one you have heard today, for the audience at one of my shows at The Dolby Theater in Los Angeles.
Y) When I attempted to get a permanent restraining order, after a public hearing, in my opinion, the judge denied my request because Mezger didn’t put his hands on me.
X) Since that night, I feel less safe IN my home than out of my home. I filed for a restraining order and was granted a temporary one.
W) Here is a screenshot of the video to illustrate how close Mezger is. See the arrow in red of where his property line is and see the green arrow which is the entrance to my bedroom? https://t.co/9qREOizgqZ
V) When I ran out the front door, they saw me quite panicked. We invited the officer in and shared the video with him.
U) It turns out Randy wasn’t even in the house. He was outside the house still speaking with the officer.
T) You hear me calling for Randy because it was the dark of night. I didn’t know where Randy was or if he was ok. It was highly unlike him to not answer or come to my side. I feared the worst.
S) It was captured on my simple NEST security camera located outside my bedroom door.
R) The police arrived and spoke to Mezger about the noise. Before the LAPD had even driven away, Mr. Mezger went right to his backyard and that’s when his misogynistic rage and homophobic slurs started.
Q) Here’s the video again. A professional court reporter provided the transcription. I was terrified. I truly had no idea what he was capable of doing. I feared for my safety. https://t.co/9Aq8AADkjA
P) The decision to make a noise complaint with the LAPD did not spring out of nowhere. As you know, I’m not looking to be on TMZ, so it had to be really bad for me to call the LAPD. I don’t want to waste the LAPD’s time or taxpayer dollars.
O) If you’re wondering why Randy and I called the police... Without going into too much detail, in my opinion, the Mezgers have been the nosiest, loudest, most adversarial neighbors I have ever had. Jeffrey Mezger, in particular.
N) Who the hell wants to be in a fight with their neighbors? Not me.
M) Yes, I’m a comic who tells inappropriate jokes and wildly high-larious stories on stage, but at home, I’m kinda boring. I want my home to be a sanctuary. I think your home should be whatever you want it to be, as long as you’re not bothering anyone else.
L) KB Home builds homes and is one of the largest homebuilders in the country. The company has likely earned millions in revenue every year and has thousands of employees. https://t.co/UQaaHISfXa
K) Another reason to take on a Goliath like a powerful CEO? I am living in a home I love and I busted my butt for decades to be able to buy it. I want to enjoy it! Jeffrey Mezger is the CEO of @KBHOME, a public company that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
J) I have a long history and body of work which has been shining a light on all kinds of issues and speaking truth to power. Can you imagine me, of all people, staying silent about harassment and threats? Nope. Time’s Up.
I) During a public four day temporary restraining order hearing in open court Mr Mezger said, under oath, that he didn’t consider “dyke” to be a negative word to call a gay woman! https://t.co/IJStnkAHhY
H) How many women have been scared into silence or spent to death because men like Mezger found them inconvenient?
G) How many women has he called “cunts”, “bitches” and “let’s declare war….’cause we’ve got a lot to go for”? I don’t know. So many brave women have spoken out, I need to honor them. I’ve made a 5K donation to Time’s Up. Link at end of thread.
F) As a proud ally of the LGBTQ community, I have to wonder how many other women have been called a “dyke” by Mezger and have not had the resources or platform to stand up for themselves? I’ve made a 12K donation to The Trevor Project, link at the end of this thread.
E) I shaved my head in solidarity with her, as so many of you have who are touched by cancer. Did he call other people dealing with chemotherapy bald? I have made a $5K donation to The American Cancer Society. If you’d like to donate, there’s a link at the end of this thread.
D) Why did he call me a “bald dyke”? Did he know that just two days earlier my sister Joyce passed away from a long, brutal battle with cancer?
C) To be clear, it IS permissible for me to speak publicly about an ongoing civil case. Why post now? I have questions. Why did he have to invoke the president’s name??? Ok, maybe that part was about me. But it is the other communities I am advocating for.
B) Look, I feel a responsibility. “Oh Kathy, just drop it, life’s too short.” But I realized it’s not just about me. Plus, the Mezgers are suing ME and Randy and are seeking damages of a million + dollars! Randy and I are the defendants. The defendants can’t drop a case.
A) SOUND ON. NSFW. Do you want to see what exercising your First Amendment right looks like? This is a video of my next door neighbor, Jeffrey T. Mezger, the CEO of @KBHOME. We, of course, did not call the Police on his grandchildren! https://t.co/0RP1UP1Q4c

@JaneEdithWilson @GaryLuuucy It’s more important then your family, your career or climate change. I know that sounds harsh but it’s true, goddamnit. Gary, not speaking to you.
@JaneEdithWilson @GaryLuuucy Omg. WHAT? I’m never speaking to him again. I don’t mean that I’m jealous that he won. Who the fuck wants to pass up an award show with a bunch of celebrities dressed up all fancy and gettin wasted and maybe telling Gary some things he could pass on to me…or you? I’d never pry.

D) Whether it’s physical, sexual, or verbal abuse, men need to STOP. They need to stop assaulting, controlling, hurting, and threatening women. ANY man in ANY industry, take notice… We’re stronger than you fucking think.
C) These women spoke out knowing they would more than likely never get a resolution. However, they did it to protect the future generations of women that have yet to experience this soul crushing abuse.
B) I want to say thank you to Ava, Courtney, Mandy, Megan, Phoebe, and the other unnamed women in this article. Each one of you stood up. Each one of you were honest.

@RitaOra @BebeRexha Love both of you ladies. Bebe brought the heat at the Clive Davis party tonight. Sorry I did not have a chance to see you and say hi, my love. KG
@ColMorrisDavis Let’s just say, she is not a fan of my work. Not everyone gets my comedic genius😎
I think I can comfortably say that this is my richest fan. I asked @tim_cook if he would like a photograph with a REAL STAR. He giggled and complied. Love a powerful mogul who can roll with a joke. https://t.co/8MfPRUzmHH

@MyAsthmaIsBad I hear what you’re saying. But there is a big part of politics where we have to be realistic. Remember when Obama said you have to be in the arena? He’s in the arena. I hear the issues you probably have with him. We all want someone with a background that WE think is perfect.
@swedishgurl Yes it will be up on YouTube and a couple of days. Thank you for asking and I hope you enjoy it!

@TopherSpiro @deray https://t.co/jgDHm1H5qg’s also Jeff Zeleny and all the other predictably sexist white reporters that picked on Hillary for every little thing, when they were caught with their pants down, they still haven’t admitted their participation in the bullshit election of 2016.

@profkeithdevlin THANK YOU. I know folks have a preconceived notion that mathematics as taught in school isn’t applicable to their everyday lives, but you’ve just pointed out that a relatively simple calculation like this, is.  I think I have some real grammatical issues with this sentiment. :)

@starrpower_44 @joniernst No I don’t agree with how she votes, but two wrongs don’t make a right and God only knows what her husband was doing to her.
@ChristieFiddle @joniernst Sadly, that is a very common situation.
@SoozleMcDoozle @yashar @joniernst She does, but two wrongs don’t make a right and God only knows what her husband was doing to her.
@strosie232 @joniernst I agree but two wrongs don’t make a right.
@FriendoftheJedi @joniernst She was a yes for Kavanagh, but two wrongs don’t make a right so I stand by her. Also God knows what her husband was doing to her.
@wordlass1 @yashar @joniernst I honestly think it’s a process of being colonized within the abuse. Just my theory but, I still support her decision because two wrongs don’t make a right. It’s frustrating she voted for Kavanagh, but God only knows what her husband did to her.
@trophywifediet @joniernst Thank you for saying this. There are many statistics that back this up. We know it.

Sick of seeing reporters/pundits treating the shutdown like a both sides issue. One side is negotiating in good faith: Dems. The other side isn’t. Giving 3 years of DACA protection is not a fair negotiation. The Democrats are offering billions for border security. That’s fair.

@Jekajojo OK so your argument would be if I had an hour long video but only 30 seconds of it showed a murder, I should focus on the rest of the film or the murder?
@MsActionologist @thedaddystylist You’re blaming the victim. You know better. You’re a woman. Act like it.
@Deidramayfair Well we are not going to give them the privacy that they do not deserve. Remember Charlottesville? Heather Heyer was MURDERED because we wanted to hear from both sides. By the way, Charlottesville cops, we’re watching you. You look pretty fucking dirty right now.
@JaGang_ If they were POC they would be charged as adults and you know it.
@JoeBegay10 Snowflakes
@Jekajojo Wake up. Watch it again.
@ToriBarron13 @DJSvegas Unfortunately that is and how progress is made. Institutions can get away with feeling separated by the actual incident because the school itself didn’t sanction that kind of behavior.
@DJSvegas Yes
@angelical314 @beconsaw ARE YOU APOLOGIZING FOR THEM?
@DaMxFx Proof? From a legitimate news source? I would like to see it.
@buh_nanas These moron kids don’t even know what the fuck their platform is. They just want to start shit. And I have a feeling they know mommy and daddy and all of their white privilege orange dumbass supporters will protect them. Well as they say, times up.
@cheryld65 I am worried. Remember Charlottesville? A THOUSAND Nazis, a murder, two very seriously injured, four arrests. And the trial for Heather Heyer’s murderer got little to no press coverage. We must raise awareness ourselves. No one is going to help us.
@42_cliff Fuck off. You are about as affective as a flaccid penis. IMPOTENT RESPONSE
@42_cliff Well looking here...gotcha!
@42_cliff Names please. And stories from people who can identify them and vouch for their identity. Thank you.
@frigginfrogs @batzona412 Wake up!
@ColetteArquette Yeah where the fuck is that little shithead? And I would like his adult Maga defenders, parents or whomever put that bile into his dim brain, to show up on television and make their case. But they must be shouted down with someone who has actual facts and knows history.
@faithlessmuse @Vikingviking Actual human beings and the Internet have a way of working these things out. These “catholic”kids must be identified by name, we need to know their whereabouts for the nations safety. Calm down, there are no minors who have been wrongly identified to the point of being in danger
@GaryManfre Oh and to answer your question literally, they have no Republican that they even want to run. My guess is they have a fantasy that Trump will have a meltdown and that they love the idea of a very dangerous president Mike Pence. I think that’s what we should be watching for.
@GaryManfre Oh stop that. We have an amazing stable. It’s only the Republicans that are trying to convince us that we don’t have stars. We have an abundance of stars. Booker, Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Beto, Julian Castro, Kiersten Gillibrand and on and on.

@cullenbunn Oh wait, this is Kathy Griffin talking. So I’m going to have to go with “ Kathy Griffin My Life on the D List” @shanedawson says @netflix should buy the bundle of all six seasons from me. He says young people really like it. Like, a lot of young people! @Netflix_CA I’m bingeable!
@Garrett_Watts @cullenbunn @TheBrandonQuinn Garrett or Brian or whatever your name is you son of a bitch, you were supposed to say “Kathy Griffin My Life on the D List”. I had plenty of gay guys kissing on that show!❤️🌈💖

@Johnnymaaac @iamcardib These orange dumbass followers don’t even know that in Putin’s Russia, no citizens are allowed to carry our own a gun, they do not have Facebook. They have a Russian version of it that is controlled. How do so many Americans not even know these simple two facts?

@JamesWadeMyers @iamcardib Wrong answer. Try again.
@lohal13 @stellaaaa @iamcardib Honestly, it is ridiculously overdue. Those all dinosaurs don’t even know how to question Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey. They will learn a lot from @AOC they would be smart to watch the @iamcardib tape as well. I am very serious!
@LindaSN0228WI @iamcardib Elections have consequences! Fuck Trump! If you don’t stand up for something, then sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up. And when you do stand up and say something, like Cardi B, know what the fuck you’re talking about! How’s that, motherfucker?
@reyeliza__ @iamcardib I wonder that too.
@fabalasays @iamcardib Yes and she is a new mom so she’s probably even more motivated to be informed. I love her passion and she is asking all the right questions.

I love that Speaker Pelosi is the ultimate decision maker on this...it's her choice and Trump hates that a woman is in charge of this decision! https://t.co/a0H7roZttf
B) Even though I've had over 20 comedy specials on TV (and hold the Guinness Book of World Records for this!), none of the cable networks or streaming services wanted this comedy concert film. So I funded and produced it myself. I'm so proud that it's premiering at @sxsw
I have some big news to share...my first ever comedy concert film is premiering at @sxsw!!!! It's called "Kathy Griffin: Hell Of A Story" and I'm so excited to share it with all of you!   Join my mailing list for updates: https://t.co/JwPYDCdWvh  https://t.co/eklLpxuXS5 https://t.co/agP5kTkf1N

@ryanjreilly I’m confused. Is this yours, Ryan or do you have a competitor in the fake Washington Post business? I mean I am happy to subscribe to both.
YES!!!!! https://t.co/uSM8wF7O9Y

Congratulations @ira, you’re an EGOT now! https://t.co/RrEyLecPnt

@DonCheadle Thank you for this, Don. I have a lot of respect for you and I know we are of like mind politically. I'll admit I am still frustrated that 17 months after the Trump pic I still don't have a significant public advocate. Sometimes these frustrations bubble up unexpectedly. xoxo KG

@jonibetrue Good! More people should pay attention to this. I learned firsthand how important the AG is to a private citizen. Everyone should know this. It happened to me and trust me it can happen to you.
@duckie4455 Went for it. Check my replies.😎
@StillJohnCA You think I give a shit about that fucking picture anymore. Please.
@MsLoveSeek Yes! Can we? Why don’t men speak up about this? Don’t they care about their wives, mothers, girlfriends, sisters, cousins, aunts, or do they just care about themselves in the end? This is what men should be asking themselves every fucking single day.
@StillJohnCA I thought I knew the lines, but they change them on me and now they’re just all blurry and zigzag. But I am solidly grounded and know exactly what I am doing. I promise. Big announcements coming.
@HollandDonna2 Taken down as many houses as I can right now. Thank you!

@kevinjwoods1 I loved playing five markets in Canada. You guys totally get it. Sorry, you’re stuck with the neighbor who is a certified psychopath. Oh, one more thing, he’s the president of the United States. Give us a little more time. I promise we are working on it.
@CLD_bab @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @DevinNunes I understand but we can still speak up and stand up.

@achuck1Matthew I’ve never had a drink in my life. It is very well-documented. But I do have a right to speak my mind. And I seriously do not give a fuck after everything I’ve been through. Would you?
@GramlyMd @DonCheadle I am the mayor and CEO of zero FucksVille.
@Tanman_999 @DonCheadle Make him look it up and see if he has the balls to reprint it with an apology
@Arthur_Klein1 @DonCheadle Talk to me after you’ve been a Subject of a two month federal investigation, had to federal agencies considering charging you with wait for it, conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States. And where do you think it came from? The president of the United States.
@BlackXtian @DonCheadle What I’ve been through is historic. Literally never happened in the history of the United States. Look it up. Closest case I could come through is the now passed away icon,  Eartha Kitt. Don, surely you are familiar with her story
@benwa_balls @DonCheadle No
@lmschaal @DonCheadle Look it up. Ask him. Ask him for the tweets before I publish them myself. Yes, I have kept a list and as I’ve said my memory is long.
@vintagejoehill @DonCheadle Never had a drink in my life. Very well-documented. Look it up asshole
@matthewCroCan @DonCheadle I don’t take Ambien but please enjoy yours
@jaygiannone @DonCheadle Oh yeah, that’s me I’m a known crackhead. I’ve never even had a drink in my life you asshole. I’m too busy fighting for the First Amendment and paying legal bills.
@TraLC @DonCheadle Yes, he’s a great actor. Not such a great guy in real life. Sorry but true.
@timur_debbag @DonCheadle He would be willing advised to do so. He won’t. They never do.
@JTill247 @DonCheadle Shut the fuck up. I haven’t had Botox in 15 years. How’s yours?
@BDaddy1967 @DonCheadle Hello? Have you ever heard of the first amendment? You obviously don’t know my full story. It’s very well-documented. Take five minutes. I still do not have one single day of paid work ahead of me. Is that what you want for yourself? I don’t want it for you.
@The_UnSilent_ @DonCheadle Neither did I. We had a good conversation one time. I guess he was just full of shit. Still waiting for someone of consequence to publicly stand up for what I am going through. No one with actual, visual power. You could’ve. Enjoy your new job, &amp; yet I hope this never happens 2 u
@DonCheadle You don’t remember? Look up your tweets from May 30, 2017 or May 31. You. Of all people. Just another Hollywood movie star phony. You really had a problem with my photo? U don’t know a smear campaign from the oval office, the tabloids, the actual news, two federal investigations?
@tanamongeau Ok, I speak semi-fluent Tana💖
@PageSix Please print her settlement amount right now.
@PageSix Oooooh, hotttt! I like it!
@PageSix I love her. I spent a lot of time talking to her on Christmas eve and she is a doll! Candid and funny as hell! Please love and support her!
@AdamSerwer @morgfair Pat Buchanan needs to be in a home. A home for the insane.
@dabeard @morgfair @ThePlumLineGS I can’t recall, is Mitch McConnell’s age 120 or 121?
@ira Of course he’s coming back. There is a cabal of power man, all who have been me tood or know that there are about me tood, who are having meetings about how to bring each other back. Be vigilant forward thinking, people!
@MensHumor @ryanAguzman OK here comes my blacklist from ABC, but we are beyond this show. Sorry, but we just can’t afford guilty pleasures at the moment. I’m not thrilled at seeing women act like prostitutes who will work for free for some fucking loser who always turns out to be unemployed.
@BillKristol @morgfair The only people who should be excepting any jobs much less positions at such a high level should be democratic psychiatrists. I don’t care what they tell the orange dumbass, just make sure that they are democratic psychiatrists.
@kylegriffin1 @MSNBC Please do not let the story die. It sounds fantastic go to those who do not pay attention to the news, but many experts are saying it is truly the biggest story of the year.
@rgay @LAUSD @WGAWest My sister was a proud member of the @LAUSD. As I have been tweeting this, I have been getting hate replies. Seriously? She died of cancer last year and was very grateful that she had the best insurance from all her years as being a public school teacher in Chicago &amp; in the LA.
@Chris_Meloni And it probably wasn’t even his sofa.
@eduardodlgd Love her. Now and forever.
@slpng_giants He’s putting it on tonight. Guaranteed.
@paulkrugman @Chris_Meloni They are soooproud of the fact that they have never voted prior to the 2016 election. They know nothing about policy and lie that they are true constitutionalists. Also they’re so fucking stupid they don’t care about the down ballot voting which actually effects their daily lives
@RealDLHughley Nothing is scarier in today’s America than white men. Especially white men with guns. The real terrorists. Why women stick up for gun ownership or their men owning guns, when data shows they are much more likely to have that gun pointed at them by “their man” is a mystery to me.
@RVAwonk Thank you for showing actual disinformation. Now how do we convince all these fucking Facebook morons that they are believing this disinformation. A simple dictionary description of the word disinformation?
@KenRoth @morgfair Yes it is obvious that he is an old fart who has lost his mind. So obvious! Come on people.
@SarahBurris @morgfair Gurrrl, they’re not THAT worried.
@ScottFeinberg @RVAwonk @GreggJarrett Well, a lot of my relatives in Illinois and surrounding area’s believe that shit and think I am an actual member of Isis. No things have not gotten better for me. This article is proof of why. They don’t even know how to fucking identify this information. Low information voters.
@SocialPowerOne1 @morgfair She probably nervously said “yes”. Fake republican centrist. Can we please finally just give up on her?
@kimmasters End of times. George W would’ve loved it. Jesus Christ!
@markknoller Ask more follow-ups. You will be a star.
@DonCheadle @slpng_giants Oh GREAT Don. I will never forgive you for your nasty tweet the day my smear campaign started. You know it was a fucking smear campaign and you have never taken a moment to apologize. Some liberal you are. Yes, my memory is long my ex friend. Shame on you. I kept a list. Fear me.
@yasmeenkhan @morgfair I’m going to go out of my way to thank them next time I go to an airport. Well they might detained me, but during my detention I will make sure to thank them.
@Karnythia @jennyhan Yes I kind of like him. I’ve never met him and I really hope he does not get me too- ed. But I’m telling you as someone who has worked in Hollywood for many decades, pretty much any guy over 40, let’s just say you have to keep your eye on them. Sorry but true.
Warning, I am on a fucking tear tonight. I don’t care what time it is. Buckle up.
Great company! He can’t hear very well but he sure knows how to blow a dog whistle.  Steve, what are you take his measurements for the clan outfit? Make sure you get him a hurricane. https://t.co/xfti8kZ4Wc
Don’t try me bitch. You are not going to win this fight against me, gurrrl. Put your KKK clan outfit back on. Maybe you will trip in the woods. That would be a real shame. Wait, have you &amp; your fellow nazis ever considered marching in Watts in Los Angeles? U should!  #Parperview? https://t.co/Y9g7OetecP
@deray You’re going to make me cry. Oh, the innocence. I mean this afministration compared to a teenage boy intentionally jumping off his roof… No contest.
@TheRickWilson @WhitfordBradley What is she is so afraid of? I guess I’m not supposed to call a woman a pussy but I call it as I see it, Susan Collins is a pussy. Grow a pair, gurrrl. XXOO
@yashar @clarissaward She is one of the few real reporters at @CNN. Doesn’t get the glory of some other high profile anchors there get. Sexist much #JeffZucker? Hey, im BANNED, so I don’t give a fuck and they KNOW I cannot be silenced. They fucked with the wrong bitch💋💅🏼💪
@JohnWDean We do know it’s obvious. Unfortunately our country has been slightly brainwashed and is full of low information voters. I know many of these people and they are very PROUD that they have never voted before 2016! Of course they voted for DT.Thrilled! Clueless re down ballots too.
@BWing84 @JillWineBanks @DrCherylBrodie Great question! Let’s make him squirm.
@JillWineBanks Jill what can we do? I fear this guy used to be a true institutionalist but now he is just an old nut job. Expect the online disinformation campaign to kick into high gear tomorrow. Lots of low information sharing Facebook lies and Memes.
@mitchellreports Legend supporting Legends! I love it!
@RVAwonk Caroline, what’s it gonna take to convince these robots? She’s as nuts as Trump &amp; a stupid as Jill Stein. What countries has she visited that are under the rule of our foreign adversaries?I remember her making a lot of mysterious trips. We Dems weed out our bad ones unlike the Rs
@thehill @mitchellreports Right on time🙄🙄🙄
@tanamongeau No worries. I speak fluent Tena. She is merely expressing that she had a nice relaxing edible and her imagination is expanding at the moment. Also eggs are an excellent source of protein. Luv u Gurrrl💅🏼
@ddale8 @EricLiptonNYT Wtf?
Just based on this picture alone and meeting you, u clearly exemplify harmless but important civil disobedience. Constitutionally protected! But there was no protection for me.

@billprady Mission nearly completed. And orange dumbass cult members don’t know anything about Russia or Kremlin. Do his cult members know that they don’t even allow citizens to own guns in Russia? The ignorance is fatal.

Folks...You realize @AOC is 29-years-old and thus isn't old enough to become President? It's like you're trying to destroy her before she even has a chance to get some work done in Washington. https://t.co/BitU2HaxCo

@CynthiaAlksne Re William Barr, I know he hired you and you want to give him the benefit of the doubt because he is an institutionalist, but I fear he has changed. Those two memos he wrote make me very nervous. Sometimes, old dudes just get older and weirder.  Big fan of yours, BTW👍

@ttocsnsac He gave the money back dumbass. It is well documented. You’re a fucking racist and homophobe. You need to be exposed.
@ttocsnsac She also gave the money back you fucking moron
@ttocsnsac He already gave the money back you fucking idiot
@ttocsnsac From what I’ve heard he’s donated approximately $70,000 total. We know your game and we are not fucking having it. It’s not like he wrote $1 million check to Hillary Clinton so back the fuck off. These young black men are not going to have their memories tainted by the likes of u
@ErnieNorrman That’s what came to mind...
@lovesjnb He is supposedly a writer. He’s not much of a democratic donor, about $70,000 total, ive heard. The right wing press will use that to mute this story.
@AmiwaterTroy Help spread the word? We all need to shine a light on this tragedy. Let the pressure mount.

This story is critical. As a longtime ally, I have become so familiar with the way certain groups of men in the LGBT community are devalued by law enforcement. In this case, the victims are black gay men. Ed Buck is a predator and must be held accountable. https://t.co/NANTHMBT5b

@DarrylWarped67 @TeresaYaw He reached out to me and expressed that when he and his mom would watch “Kathy Griffin my life on the D list”, my six year series on the bravo network, they would bond. Shane expressed that my show in particular had a special meaning for him and a special meaning for his Mom🎬
@CoadyQuilts @TeresaYaw OMG, well you know how to get to me. I’m so grateful that you brought her. I’m so grateful that just by coming to one of my shows obviously she has a very open mind especially for someone her age. Gives me hope!
@RebelHeart311 @TeresaYaw We actually talked about that tonight.
@RebelHeart311 @TeresaYaw Teresa deserves it!
@SarahFDuffy @TeresaYaw It was a great city to grow up in. Close enough to the city, suburban simple middle class home, but glad I wasn’t raised in a super small town/rural, all white neighborhood.

I love @AOC more and more every day. I look forward to seeing what she can get done when there’s a Democratic POTUS.
. @AOC is saying that it’s shameful that CBS hasn’t hired a single black reporter for their 2020 presidential team...She’s calling them out for their diversity issues. Trump calls the media the enemy of the people.   Your false equivalency is shameful https://t.co/F6pJJg6Vll

@itsgottaendsoon @realDonaldTrump Russian bots and a few cultists who think the south won the civil war. So many of them have never voted before the 2016 election. They will fade back into obscurity in due time.
@Mazsupernatural I keep thinking about how he was sitting there alone at the end of a booth. It’s my impression he was definitely waiting for someone. I’ll bet it’s been a very long time since Leslie Moonves had to WAIT for HIS guest to arrive. Ha ha! Love it😂

@flinthaven @RaminSetoodeh I honestly couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw him having the nerve to be sitting in such a high profile Hollywood restaurant. All I could think of, what if one of his victims innocently walked in , only to have to face this monster? I said “Leslie?” He said “hi” U know the rest!
@flinthaven @RaminSetoodeh They did kindly move me to a better table away from his smug face.

@annamiree @Illeanarama He was alone when I saw him.
@canyonroad52821 Yes he did.
@IMGiatti I did not know then what I know now. Trust me I would have no qualms doing the same thing in his presence today. I am not afraid of any of these fuckers anymore. And what have you done to speak out, to protect the rights or make a statement about survivors of abuse today? Hmmmm?

@leahmcelrath @MalcolmNance Leah, are there certain GOP senators that we can target to put the pressure on? Maybe just a list of six, with their contact info (not private, of course) ?  We need McConnell to feel he doesn’t have the votes.
@mkraju Jesus
@samstein Omg. You know he said those exact words.
@kylegriffin1 Can this be double applied to the White House kitchen?😎
@TeaPainUSA Oooh, good point! It’s probably the same for him, in his twisted, half brain.
@dreamhampton You are correct. As a survivor of #metoo AND @TIMESUPNOW , White women AND men must do a better job of conveying Dream’s simple/obvious motto, BLACK GIRLS MATTER. United we stand, divided we fall. We need to HAVE BLACK GIRLS’ BACKS! WOC, all colors, can we finally stand together?

1. @LeaderHoyer: "Trump is now going to order [IRS employees to issue refunds]. To do what we think is illegal because he wants to act like a dictator. Federal employees are being damaged by this shutdown."    2. Obama followed the law in 2013 during the shutdown: no refunds https://t.co/HaekIZaxhQ
And Democrats have announced they believe its illegal. So lets see. https://t.co/QkERGXeGRG
B) For those saying that the IRS is issuing refunds, they may say that now but Democrats do not believe it's legal. So let's see...https://t.co/8W5TqGCinx
Another fact: in the next couple weeks some people will file their 1040s so they can get their refunds...money some people really need to pay their bills. Thanks to Trump, they're not going to get the money that's owed to them and that they need during a lean time of the year.
As Trump spouts off with his BS...a reminder of when he had this conversation about the wall with the then President of Mexico. We know what was said thanks to leaked transcripts published in the Washington Post.   https://t.co/6heXOac0YU https://t.co/GmzGh8qvgv

Why do I go after TMZ? Because of “stories” like this. They are just shills for R Kelly and that’s sick. They posted this yesterday just as R Kelly is seeking to discredit the survivors. As @dreamhampton asked, how does TMZ keep getting these R Kelly exclusives? https://t.co/9Ubfk8TBtE

@alotofclout @CupcakKe_rapper We all need it.

@cjnitelife @yashar Thank you for the correction but I will not take it back. I am not a news organization and I am done taking things back. Biden did Anita Hill dirty.
@historBilia Just want you to know, there is a whole male apparatus openly trying to help him to come back. They are my former employers. They’re organizing and currently have the power. I’m taking them on. They’re pissed.
@THR Nope, nope, nope. I have spoken👑
@outmagazine @theebillyporter @PoseOnFX Love you, @theebillyporter ❤️❤️❤️
@Lavernecox YES! This is why I quit Fashion Police. I wanted to praise forward thinking fashion and looks. I didn’t want to shit on these folks and keep praising the same six celebrities who where the same six dresses.
@rgay Agree
@louisvirtel I have to admit, I went to see “Newsies” opening night in a real theater. Don’t you dare judge me! It’s a very realistic depiction of the journalism delivery system. Almost a documentary. Should’ve been in black and white.
@kschatzb @owillis @RavMABAY Yep.
@Rschooley Omg, I can’t, with this fool quoting Sean Connery in The Untouchables🙄
@Rschooley How dare you?

@NiecyNash @ReginaKing Love both of you ladies!!!
@Wildaboutmusic Hahaha👏👏👏
@AndiLee420 It’s an honor and an obligation as a human being. I get so frustrated  by the huge number of people who choose to look the other way. It’s sad, but the only effective method is calling them all out by name. These abusers count on our fear. Our silence. Not me. No thanks. Speak up
@MyEgoTripped Thank you
@Imagirl67889905 I do. All very well documented.
Follow me on Instagram: https://t.co/YMoYZnJg9c   Do it! https://t.co/P0nkyrdzmO
I’ll say it. I know so many men, powerful and powerless, who don’t think female lives matter. Can you imagine how many white men don’t think black girls matter? We have to call them out by name. One by one. United we stand, divided we fall💪💪🏻💪🏼💪🏽💪🏾💪🏿 https://t.co/0F7B2qGTbK
@TIMOTHYJOHNART Did you see the old white man juror??? Disgusting. Didn’t believe any of the girls and there’s a tape.
@Danny_Funaro @ladygaga Gross.
@yashar No thanks. I remember the Anita Hill hearings. He voted for Clarence Thomas. Nope, nope, nope.
@historBilia I’M NOT AFRAID AND HAVE CERTAINLY SPOKEN OUT ABOUT LOUIS CK. He is a serial offender who should not be forgiven because he RUINED the dreams of several women to have a career in comedy. These women changed their entire career trajectory, because of that pig.
I think white people are afraid to speak out against R Kelly because they fear it will make them appear to be racist. Many, many females of all ages still blame the girls, for various psychologically fucked up reasons. It drives me crazy #MuteRKelly https://t.co/twYb5bRuhW

@SuperPissedElle @donlemon Regarding Kevin Hart joke tweet about breaking a doll house over his son‘s head if he found out his kid was gay, makes me wonder if he is even capable of putting himself in the shoes of those who’ve actually suffered.

@HamillHimself Thank you, Mark. You are so wonderful.
@jaketapper Thank you, Jake.
@andylassner Thank you Andy, I forgive you now for all of your hockey tweets.
Q) I am so touched by all the replies to this thread. I only wish my mom could read them. It has been a very rough 17 months and I couldn't have gotten through it without all of you.
HAHAHA   Thank you @DannyPellegrino 😘 https://t.co/o7Q2AgHQjY
Thank you for giving her so much happiness. She is my best friend https://t.co/WKVjqImSHQ
@shanedawson And we love you
P) Look at her...such a natural...I’m surprised she didn’t push me out of the way! 😂 https://t.co/0jPRlfDyuB
@TomiLahren Thank you, Tomi
O) So many wonderful memories...thank you from the bottom of my heart. https://t.co/VKueCT7NTE
@thekellymantle Omg. She LOVED to brag about those moments! Thank you!
@louisvirtel Thank you so much!
@thekjohnston I love you 💔
Her home away from home! 🍷#TIPIT https://t.co/57HEVFo1N1
@janemarielynch Love you
We love you @janemarielynch https://t.co/LZoUtg0KZs
N) My amazing mom and me.... https://t.co/7DIJDe0ksA
M) I will never forget how kind so many of you were to her. People ask why I'm friends with @KimKardashian. It's simple, moments like these...when Maggie was depressed, Kim cheered her up by bringing her kids Saint and North to the house. It made Maggie's day. https://t.co/cPzyOUfdaE
L) Could any photo sum up Maggie more than this one? Glass of wine in one hand (from the box, naturally) and her favorite daughter Twinkle in the other.   TIP IT!!  P.S. Those sunglasses were mine...she may have stolen them...allegedly! https://t.co/6QSX3Ahghi
K) I would love it if you would respond to this thread with a video clip of your favorite Maggie moments or if you had the honor of meeting her a photo. While the reality for Maggie is different now, I want to remember the woman all of you fell in love with.
J) I'm so lucky that I have six seasons of My Life On The D list to look back on and enjoy moments of my mom being herself...the Maggie you all came to know and love. Remember the "Faceplace" (aka Facebook) moment? https://t.co/A6b24NvaPg
I) One of the many perks of being in show business is having the  ability/resources of being able to capture amazing moments. When I  brought @shanedawson's mom @TeresaYaw backstage at my show in LA, I had  Teresa teach Maggie about Youtube...or as Maggie called it U2 https://t.co/Gxjs8KUH1i
H) I can't tell you how many invites I get addressed to Maggie and me. @GloriaEstefan once joked that I wasn't allowed to come to her concert unless I brought Maggie! Here is a sweet video of @sharonstone meeting Maggie at my house. I'm so grateful these moments were captured. https://t.co/xuTna345vB
G) If you ever met my mom and asked for a photo, you should know it was a pleasure as much for her as it was for you. She loved making people happy and making people laugh. And trust me, I know she was the bigger star...here she is at my LA show in June greeting her many fans! https://t.co/loWSzKckGG
F) What I am most proud of when I comes to My Life On The D List is that show gave me the opportunity to show the world how naturally funny my parents were. When people tell me they feel like they know my mom, I always respond "you do!" She never put on a show, she was the show.
E) A big reason I'm sharing this news with you is that so many of you have asked why I haven't posted a video of Maggie &amp; her beloved dog Twinkle in the past few months. Now you understand why we haven't been able to share anything, here is a moment between them from this summer https://t.co/IWdzoGAHTW
D) I want to assure you all that she is not in pain and she is getting the best 24-hour care. In terms of how she is now, at this point she only knows my name and I love you. I know many of you know what that reality is like...I'm still grappling with it.
C) My mom is 98 and up until this past couple years she was so sharp she always kept me on my toes. Her mind was so naturally quick, funny, and smart. No one could get anything past her. Watching that slip away so fast has been devastating.
B) Since that photo was taken, she has rapidly fallen into the throes of dementia. This is never easy for any child, I know this is a reality that millions of people deal with every year. But when it comes to my mom this is particularly hard because her sharp mind was everything.
A) As heartbreaking as this is, I feel the need to share some important info about my mom Maggie. I've always been honest with you all, but this one is really hard. The pic below, taken in September, was the last time I was able to have a proper/coherent conversation with her. https://t.co/oqBcQTEDAB

@Kevin39522333 @TiffanyHaddish Absolutely. There is a lot of data about this. NBC news just a piece about how women are attacked 35% more on all social media platforms more than men but black women are attacked 47% more than men!
. @MittRomney https://t.co/tfemS7YTH7

MSNBC is surging https://t.co/egtbagDWxc
Fuck You. You're always there to attack women and people of color, aren't you? When's the last time you wrote a negative story about Trump? You're a bunch of fucking hacks and @TiffanyHaddish is a 👑 https://t.co/EMzjRFx8fa
This is the price of fame when you're a comic. I was so lucky that there wasn't a Snapchat/IG when I was starting out on my first big tour.  No REAL comic never bombs.   You are a hilarious, incredible talent @TiffanyHaddish and I can't wait to see you live! Ignore the haters! https://t.co/2nhpemOsGV

Thank you, again, for all the amazing comments yesterday. I have the best fans...I am so grateful.
@carterforva @kenklippenstein Omg. Is this real? Great, now some dude I went to high school with, will be passing it around on Facebook.
@MarthaPlimpton Ugh, I hate that you have to argue with dumbasses. I wish you wouldn’t delete, because I’m a fan, but I understand. Maybe you’ll come back if twitter fixes their platform? Females are attacked 35-40% more than males on here. A bunch of ignorant dudes will never get comedy nuance.

@JemRummy Oh, I will😎😍😎
@votecumby It’s not difficult to stick up for others. Not a lot of that going around these days, but I will continue to do my small part. Thank you and happy new year!🎉
@DrShark I really do believe laughter is the best medicine! Happy new year!
@CatLifeOfAWidow OMG, what a great complement! You hit the nail on the head. That is why I do comedy in any form I can’t. Thank you so much and happy new year to you and yours❤️❤️❤️
@beverleb Delicious isn’t it? ☕️☕️☕️
@AmyCringeneck @shanedawson Anytime he wants. I adore @ShaneDawson.
@FireSoul01 Makin me blush😍
@Apartment9A Thank you so much for coming to the show in San Francisco. It was my first American show since the Trump photo and I was scared, but you guys were a fantastic audience and I love the masonic theater. Happy new year!💋
@Tyler89allday Damn right! Underdog and proud of it. Just makes me more motivated. Thank you and happy new year🎊🎊🎊
@Jarrod8X 😂😂😂
@tricia_selin Can’t stop me! Thank you and happy new year!😍
@Gaoithe Highest compliment ever! Thank you so much and happy new year💖
@gragg_lola I hope it is piping hot!😍
@mikehul18704423 I try to truly contribute in anyway to the comedy world. When I kick the bucket, I just need one young person with a dream of any kind to think “Damn, they tried to take that crazy redhead down and she just would not go down for the count”. Happy new year!🎊
@Bflood28 Darling, it’s all I know how to do. That’s what pisses them off the most. I truly believe we will make progress in 2019. Thank you and happy new year!🎉
@BHL1971 They have no idea😎😎😎. Thank you and happy New Year🎉
@chicagochick37 😍😍😍
@ReddenJoyel Honesty and comedy go hand-in-hand! Thank you!
@jon_keene Correct! And after a two month federal investigation and testimony under oath with the feds, I was completely exonerated. But none of the companies I’ve made a lot of money for over the years came back. I’m hoping a lot will be revealed in 2019. Happy new year!🎊
@Chica_Latina17 I ain’t shy. I’m not done. Hell, I don’t even know what’s going to fly out of my mouth half the time! Uncensored 😎
@SLSmith Thank you! Deeply misogynistic indeed. Unfortunately the last year and a half has forced me to take a good hard look at all of these dudes, the ones who have the power, and so many are misogynistic, I’m just going to try to wear them down with humor!
@gambit244 These days all we have are our convictions, embrace them! Thank you so much for your nice complement. Happy new year!
@ParkeBench Thank you so much. I will probably take a lot of heat for it from the industry, but if they didn’t knock me out the last year and a half, they will learn I’ve only gotten stronger! Plus I am blessed with a steaming hot, bangin bikini bod :)
@AmyArtsink Hahaha! There will be more to come. I’m not exactly what you would call a shy woman😎
@allieSUNl You too ❤️
@SummerJuly12 Love that you remember and TV. The reason I ended up cohosting is because three of the celebrities left early and Carson Daly turned to me and simply said “can you stay?” I had the time of my life!🎉
@stretchdogg Thank you. Yes I learned a lot of hard lessons this year, but I also learned how to change my business model and I’m very proud of the success of my world tour. Still blacklisted in Hollywood, but eventually I will wear them down 😎🔥😎
@SueMowris1 Well they have about had it with me, but honey I am like a dog with a bone. I ain’t going anywhere. I’m certainly not going silent into that good night. 😎
@RebeccaWethman That is so encouraging to me. Thank you so much and I will continue to speak out! Happy new year!
@journey0718 Thank you so much!
@ecobbchurch Thank you so much to coming to my show at Constitution Hall in Washington DC. What a night! Right in trumps backyard😎😎😎
@Lawanda56261761 Ultimate compliment! Thank you so much!
@maggiem38900853 Awwww. Big thanks 😍
@ninastiefel It’s my mission dammit! United we stand divided we fall.💪
@deliciousalex If we as women don’t start talking about it, they win. As long as I have been in any profession, from when I was a bank teller to now, the mail boss’s always fear women openly speaking about their salaries. Why? Because our salaries are so much lower than the dudes.
@jillieparks OMG I had so much fun doing two episodes of Seinfeld. Thank you so much!
@LAHcomic The most formidable army in the world! Carry-on, soldiers💪💪💪
@louloubean89 @Lesdoggg Thank you so much!❤️
@Paulinhky Thank you. Your point is well taken and it is essential that we stick up for ourselves and others. I think people just think it is harder than it really is. Also it helps women one is emboldened as I am to not give a fuck anymore😎😎😎
@joancrown Honestly, it’s easy. More people should do it. Everyone is so afraid these days, but once you have walked through the fire as I have, you realize the only important thing is to stay strong and stick up for others...and LAUGH 😍
@Alysson4CK Yes! Thank you for getting it!
@BugDoc100 It’s important that women stick up for each other. I truly think in 2019, we are going to get stronger together and have a good year fighting for ourselves and one another.
@heiwabanzai Thank you. Time for us to get brutally honest. People are afraid of honesty but, eventually all good things come from honesty!
@Maggiemae563 Thank you. I have the pleasure of taking the puppies to a recovery center today to help to spread some giggles, doggy therapy and hope. I’m so looking forward to it!
@CorlisSarah Proud scrapper!! Thank you 💋💪💋
@KillamShawn @StormyDaniels @Andy @andersoncooper @ChrisCuomo @nickjonas Nobody, TV networks, streaming services etc. would even consider my hilarious idea of “New Year’s eve live with Kathy Griffin and Stormy Daniels.” They kept saying they were too scared. Ha ha! They’re scared? After everything Stormy and I have been through this year? Please.
@buffett_heather Never😎
@Feminishannon Amen sister! Thank you!
@mazz_jo Thank you and back atcha!
@DianaBPhotog You are correct. This is it, ladies! If we don’t do it this year, the old boys club will try to roll back the clock on us again. Not on my watch!
@mallsta Steaming hotttt
@jmartino1984 Tryin! Thank you ❤️
@bbglo1 Thank you 😍😍😍
@46Joeyjoey Omg! I love that. Remember how I would cram way too many people into my one room studio apartment? Thank God for seven years of rent control!
@Caliliberal1 A big part of my mission is I truly insist on getting paid what the guys get paid or at least the highest free I can get. If more women are vocal, the men will be shamed into coming close to equal pay. Unfortunately shaming is the only thing that works with these guys! SHAME😎
@Crystal04383267 Damn right, I’m the boss!😎
@judyreagan I’ll take it! Thank you so much!
@get2diaz Thank you 😍😍😍
@SuzieqVayglo I do love the weather Channel!
@JackieEco Well I did seriously pitch “New Year’s Eve live with Kathy Griffin and Stormy Daniels” cmon! How great would that of been? But all of the Hollywood check signers were too scared. 🤷‍♀️
@JackieEco Thank you so much!
@RickyAppleseed Thank YOU 🍾🎊🎉
@RickyAppleseed OMG thank you. Yes the neighbor situation sucks. It’s horrible to be more afraid in your own home then outside of your home.  Now he is suing me for millions of dollars. Somehow, he is suing me?🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
@laurakallday Oh my favorite new hobby is pissing off the “old white dinosaurs.” It is just now occurring to all of the power males, that I cannot be silenced and I will not be silenced. But most importantly I still want the opportunity to make you laugh 💋
@groogboober Thank you so much. I loved playing the Palladium theater. Fantastic audience!
@kris10381 Well dammit that’s all I want to do! We have to keep laughing and keep our goddamn sense of humor 😍💪😍
@Hyper_Canadian @CNN TEA!!😂
@_its_all_good_ Yes she is amazing. And Hollywood they typically start trying to put you out to pasture at about 35 or 40. But she’s too bad ass to go anywhere!
@rakitoon Thank you so much I’m on a goddamn comedy mission!💪
@quantumscribe That is so cool. Well let me say “hello” to you officially💋
@rakitoon @Lesdoggg @chelseahandler I love it. I have been pitching that idea for about 20 years to every network. I will keep pitching and trying!
@danpu Oh trust me, I will pay the price one way or another. The power of dudes get very very irritated by female honesty. Oh well💅🏼
@sassmastermk @Lesdoggg As @cher says, “if you can’t stand up for something then sit down”❤️
@NyeCameron1 Thank you so much for coming to the show. I hope you loved it!
@lalahhathaway Thank you 😍
@TeresaYaw I love you!
U) I love you all and am so grateful for the love and support you have given me.  Happy New Year to all of you! I may not be able to have a drink with you, but I have served up a pot of piping hot tea!   XOXO KG
T) Resolution #3: I will stay positive, be as brave as I can in my comedy, never quit, and never let the old boys club keep me silent or out of work.
S) Resolution #2: I have learned it is essential to stick up for others in ways I truly wish others would have stuck up for me. I have done that more than ever in the past year and will continue to do it no matter what.
R) Resolution #1: Try to make as many people laugh, giggle, gasp in shock, throw their head back and have a belly laugh for as long as possible!
Q) So each time I worked either live or on television on New Year’s Eve I would make a joke about how I didn’t believe in resolutions. Well, I’ve change my mind!   Here are my three resolutions for 2019...
P) I’ve never made serious New Year’s resolutions. Not when I did three shows on NYE at Carolines Comedy Club, or co-hosted MTV’s New Year’s broadcast in the year 2000. Remember Y2K?! I also appeared with Carson Daly in the NBC broadcast and had a blast.
O) I really hope @Lesdoggg has been paid fairly for New Years...but I'm not optimistic. The boys get paid much, much more in the comedy industry and that is a fact I know a lot about.
N) The first two years I appeared on CNN, it didn’t even occur to me to ask for a salary. The 8th year when I asked Jeff Zucker for a raise, he was so angry he docked me 30%. I’m sorry to say I took the pay cut because I truly enjoyed making you all laugh.
M) I know $150,000 is a hell of lot of money for one night of work (although when I was doing it, I certainly put in more than one night of work) but trust me Leslie has paid her dues and when you are a female comic starting out you do gigs for free sometimes for years.
L) I worked my way up by the 10th year at CNN to get a fee of $150,000. By the way, just as a point of reference, Anderson Cooper regularly bragged for years that his annual CNN contract was $10 million a year.
K) I didn’t hear anything about what Leslie‘s fee will be on NBC, but I really hope it is AT LEAST $150,000 because that is a nice paycheck and it’s what she deserves.
J) You have to admit, it didn’t make sense that NBC Uni wouldn’t have a problem with Andy Cohen, who also works for NBC Uni, appearing on CNN, but would have a problem with Leslie? Since Leslie didn't work out, CNN couldn't find one woman standup comic star to co-host? Jeff?
I) I’m thrilled she is going to appear in the NBC New Years telecast with Carson Daly/Chrissy Teigen, but it's time for Leslie to co-host/host. That would be progress...it would have been a step in the right direction for all women if she got the CNN gig https://t.co/8409e00COC
H) Soon after, I heard from a couple folks she had been dropped from the show entirely because NBC Universal did not want her to appear on a different network. This didn’t pass the smell test with me. The #JeffZucker I knew for years could make this happen. What say you, Jeff?
G) Anything less than co-hosting screams to me very little or no pay, and a lack of respect for someone who is such a proven talent, has a big fan base, and knows what she’s doing. She has paid her dues and then some!
F) As I started asking around to find out when CNN was going to announce Leslie as co-host, I heard that they had downgraded her to a couple of segments or some sort of a guest role.
E) I love all of Leslie’s work, but this little short tape she posted on her 50th birthday last year says it all about her. How can you not love @lesdoggg?! https://t.co/0KNkME8Xms
D) I was elated when I heard this news. If I can’t get the gig, I will cheer for Leslie. I don’t know her, but I thought it was such a great idea for CNN to have a woman of color over 50 who is so sharp, improvisational, and hilarious. I was ready to congratulate her publicly.
C) I heard from a few different people that the hilarious @Lesdoggg was in talks to co-host CNN’s New Year’s telecast with Anderson Cooper this year.
B) I’ve been in this business for over 30 years...I’ve gotten to know everybody. A few little birdies told me some juicy nuggets...
A) I’m so flattered and touched by all the comments saying that you miss me co-hosting the New Year’s Eve telecast. I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the positivity and I want you to know how grateful I am. So, I wanted to share some juicy gossip I heard about the telecast...
Same...definitely more than usual... https://t.co/gDSEEg1mKd

@TomArnold Just confirming that “murdering” is a stand up comedy, commonly used piece of jargon. As in...”She killed tonight” Tom, The magas are so desperate, they’ll jump on anything. :)

You self righteous ungrateful son of a bitch. You think I haven’t, and am still paying the price?

@harrylitman Mr. Litman, please tell me that you think Mueller has the goods. I have more hope that the SDNY will yield results. I am scared Mr. Mueller will think, as Gerald Ford did, that it would not be “good for the country” to impeach Trump. I am scared of a president pence, et all.

@raylansgirl Nobody does it. I enjoyed! If you ordered something I hope you left your phone number. If I call you it will come up as unidentified caller. 😍
@NoseTrevor Damn right And you’re welcome!
@dicklenhart You can probably get it from the department of justice.😎
@Angeoo On the website it tells you all the deadlines. The Christmas stuff may not ship in time, I did leave the deadline dates on the website. But I promise there are plenty of other items that will be just as meaningful for the next few months if not generations. There I said it!😍
@BrienneOfSnark_ Good one!
@kmsgirl Probably. Thank you for ordering and leaving your phone number. Even if you don’t answer I will leave a voicemail.💪🙏🙏
@Imthethunderman Yes, do not hang up on me!😍
@MichaelBudd65 Too late for Christmas items, but never too late for all the other items. Check out the merchandise. Some of it is naughty and some of it is nice. You decide and make sure you leave your phone number so I can call you.💖
@HighTechWriter @Apple Is days in office are numbered. I think even he knows it.
@VaughanPappy Haha! Hopefully I have your phone number as well as your name so I can call you. Then you can faint afterwards😂
@Victorbowtieguy Did you leave your phone number? Mine will come up as unidentified caller. If you don’t answer I promise I will leave a message.🙏🙏🙏🙏
@StephBenton1972 I love that you bought the retro tee. I wore it when I attended the @Cher Broadway Premier with @Rosie 💖💖💖
@Nolalady20 Thanks a lot. I shaved my head completely bald when my sister got cancer to show solidarity with her. My hair is growing out.
@MJ_Adamson You missed the Christmas deadline but I do sales all the time and I have a feeling these items may still be meaningful, if you know what I’m saying😎 Plus there are lots of T-shirts and other items non-holiday related. Do it!💋
@socalmom @aravosis I leave voicemails as well. I hope you left your phone number when you ordered. Keep checking your voicemails!💕💕💕
@JessicaMachak Happy to be part of the shutdown. The Trump shutdown not a government shutdown😎
@HAL060911 Live!! ❤️
@tricia_selin Thank you so much! Make sure you leave your phone number. And when I called it comes up as an identified caller 💕
@sthomas1122 Did you leave your phone number? If I call it will be under unidentified caller. You never know😎
@loueejii You would be perfect❤️
@jbobik4 Oh honey, in the last year and a half trust me I have been humbled and humbled and humbled. Just glad to get my hustle back! Thank you so much!
@ARTFLAWP Yeah!

@jamescharles I know the feeling. Since you film so much you need to setup a soundproof studio somewhere. Enough is enough.

@oren_sam @jasoninthehouse I agree
@HezakiahP @jasoninthehouse I’m sorry to agree with you, but yes in this instance they are beasts. Letting a small girl die in an unimaginable and tortured way. They are going to try to convince you it was her fault. That is their game.

@Slotjinx63 @MarkRuffalo Not perfect but better than $20,000 a day which is the average cost for a hospital stay if something dire happens. ACA was a steppingstone. Healthcare for all will be a bitter struggle with the Republicans and the orangutanin in chief. Are you going to fight for it or not?
@Joy_Benson @MarkRuffalo @CharlesMunn1 So do I. So does everyone with insurance. Wake up and stop whining as if you are the worst victim in America. If you were done your research you would’ve realized Obama had to make a compromise and healthcare for all will be a gigantic struggle. Are you willing to fight for it?
@RebelTheNovel @MarkRuffalo You do realize we lost the 2016 election, right? Are you sure you voted?
@woodenbee @MarkRuffalo Too many Americans were such suckers. It’s embarrassing for us to admit, but until you admit it we are not going to be able to improve our own day-to-day living situation. And I agree healthcare should be at the top of that list.
@woodenbee @MarkRuffalo Thank you very much! Love to you as well💖
@Spacemomsdaugh2 @MarkRuffalo @AlanTudyk Talk to your crooked governor in your crooked legislators. Take your anger out on them. It was they’re decision &amp; they knew what they were doing. If you’re unhappy put your love of trump aside and just look into your local down ballot elections. Remember elections are EVERY year
@MerkaDerpn @MarkRuffalo Oh boy. You’re probably not going to get it within 24 hours are you? My guess is you live in a red state. Maybe your governor turn down the Medicaid expansion. Maybe you don’t know any of this. Low information voter. Bye

I am going to show up in one of these emails phone calls or texts. What happened to me as a result of the photo/Trump mask posted May 30, 2017, resulted in a well coordinated media smear against me as well as a full department of justice investigation. I will get the receipts!

@Lisatweets444 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel I believe he was doing his civic duty as well. I wish more high-profile comics who know Trump, as I did, would come out of the shadows and not be so fearful. Several have reached out to me &amp; expressed that because of my situation they are scared. Frankly I think they are pussies
@paulacohennyc @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel No comedians will be persecuted in the way I was as long as I am alive. Not on my watch! I’ve learned a hell of a lot in the last year and a half and enjoy sharing it with everyone from Michelle Wolf to Samantha Bee and now Noel💪💪💪
@MatthewArend @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel The NDA is expired.
@OurRepublic12 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel The 1st amendment says it can be both. Comedians are certainly not held to the standard of those who make a living putting out facts and only facts. Elected, hard news journos, CEO’s, &amp; other professions where there is no ambiguity that blurs the line between fact &amp; hyperbole.
@p_Johanna The tide has turned in the last year and a half since my photo scandal. I live it every day. The American public is coming around in this in a very different place about this sort of thing then they were a year and a half ago. Noel is covered.
@IsntAllItSeems @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel It’s expired &amp; any standards &amp; practices executive will have to testify that it is on enforceable as it is so over-the-top. We are exiting the era of NDA’s being able to completely silence innocent civilians especially when they are in the middle of doing their job, as a comic.
@AnyMtn @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel I think she will win on repeal. Just my opinion but the wheels are in motion.
@CarvemupJames @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Thank you it is my mission to make sure that this never happens to a comedian again. No comedian should have to go through what I went through and continue to go through.
@Stefonek @deliciousalex @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel He is covered if he claims both. There’s nothing wrong with the comedian mixing facts with hyperbole. He’s also talking about something that took place over many years with hundreds of other witnesses. They can all be subpoenaed. There are crew sheets. Easy.
@deliciousalex @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel There is a reason it is the FIRST amendment😎
@DirkAydlette @mrkat07 @defnotscifi @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Whether it takes a go fund me or public outcry, if necessary nor will get the best first amendment attorney in the United States. The ACLU is also been made aware of the situation.
@DirkAydlette @defnotscifi @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Correct, excellent observation! They can subpoena and a pose every single crew member who has ever worked on a trump production with Noel.  You seen the video of trump in a simple deposition correct? Yikes!
@thekarki @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel I don’t know where you are getting your information but as someone who has lived through this for the last year and a half and jokingly been offered partnerships at three law firms, I know for a fact that Noel is covered under the first amendment.
@GOCHISOX1 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Yes! Comedians do it every day in clubs and large concert halls all over America!
@Lisatweets444 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel He doesn’t care. He has true conviction about this issue.
@NeonShines @ego_lies @Pardons4All @CaslerNoel Despite of what he says he is a fame whore just like everybody else. He demanded several photos with me and my beloved Liza Minnelli. I sure as hell wasn’t going to leave Liza alone with him!
@TheEdMix @ego_lies @Pardons4All @CaslerNoel 👏👏👏
@xeni @CastorNoel Luckily Noel is covered under the first amendment if it is true or pure comedy embellishment.
@Ladydadda1 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel I got a First Amendment attorney who won a landmark Supreme Court case. Yes it cost me a ton of money and a lot of time and suffering. I made a lot of mistakes along the way and had to learn a lot about the system frankly, but I emerged victorious &amp; prevailed. Noel will be fine.
@JaBbA64 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel It isn’t libelous if it’s true. Can you imagine how many crewmembers witnessed this behavior over the years? The Trump family is well aware of this. My guess is the Trump family has known about this all along as have his doctors.
@MorningTuna @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Yes. Bring it on.
@CarvemupJames @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel It’s really true. I admire at Noel’s bravery. And frankly I’m disappointed in all the extremely wealthy and high profile comedians who are afraid to go for Trump. I feel if you do not address this administration‘s atrocities, as a comedian, you are derelict in your duty.
@Mominsweats @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel They can also subpoena all of the other crew members from all six live Apprentice finales as well as the beauty pageants. Remember human beings are evidence as well.
@GOCHISOX1 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Of course. He did not break the law in anyway. Nor did I with my photo, but the White House the oval and the DOJ figured out a way to intimidate me make me unemployable, uninsurable and tried to spend me to death. This will not happen to Noel on my watch.
@jnnyjny @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel I agree. I’m not crying poor but I certainly am not going to watch Noel rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills and no @LisaBloom bad representation. I do believe a go fund me would be successful. Noel will not have to go through what I did. Not on my watch!
@Daniel22223333 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel He is covered. Anyone can sue him civilly as you know, and anyone who tries to will have to go through discovery. No trump or Trump associates will want to do that. They would be able to subpoena every crew member from of every season finale of the live Apprentice shows😘
@nj_jcarter @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Don’t worry. Fake news is not anywhere in the constitution any of the amendments and is a term that is not recognized by the courts at all. Everything all set on stage is absolutely covered by the First Amendment.
@StefanieTiels @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel I’ve learned so much in the last year and a half from the miscarriage of justice that I went through, that I know exactly how to handle this situation in a way that will level the Trump family into a pool of tears and urine.
@Andrew_pepsi @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel The apprentice NDA is online and it is so over-the-top that it is virtually unenforceable.  And yes the law sees statements made by a comedian in a professional, comedy venue as freedom of speech, freedom of expression. He is covered in the Trump folks know it.
@Big_Ty @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel As you know anyone can sue anyone civilly. In fact Trump has something like 200 civil suits in the coffee waiting for him already. He will not take Noel on. Also we have a First Amendment attorney on deck that will scare the Trump family shitless.
@mandonita30 @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel There is a statute of limitations and the apprentice NDA is already online and has been widely seen, even by standards and practices network executives I have spoken to as unenforceable.
@bbrentterry @PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel Not true. The law sees this sort of thing similar to a painting. Can be interpreted different ways. For example my photo can be interpreted as a joke or a statement or… Freedom of Expression. “

@Metroid_Common @CaslerNoel Good clarification💖🙏
@JackSarfatti @CaslerNoel Nope. Covered under the 1st Amendment. I outta know💋
@Pardons4All @CaslerNoel 💪💪💪
@codnugget777 @CaslerNoel Good. He’ll need our online support 💪
@cathyob1 @CaslerNoel Great point!
@rozellamarkee @Lee_in_Iowa @CaslerNoel @NationalNOW Yes, he should be protected. Not just left out in the cold. Whether he’s doing a bit or being completely truthful.
@PappsPenny @MSMWatchdog2013 @CaslerNoel He’s covered. He’s a comic on a professional comedy stage. Not an elected or journo. Totally within the umbrella of satire in the 1st Amendment.
@simoneski @CaslerNoel Omg. I’ve never even heard of that one!

Answer the question....what is your reaction @jjauthor to the fact that Trump lied repeatedly about settlements paid to Stormy Daniels and Karen MacDougal? https://t.co/aUVObskCNs
She says on the same day that Trump's attorney was sentenced on charges including lying to Congress. Some of the charges included settlements Trump has repeatedly lied about.

@theappeal @shaunking As someone who has done comedy shows in a prison...yep. Most women who are incarcerated are there because they participated in a crime with “their man.” Also the women’s movement has been very derelict in our duty by leaving incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women behind.

@TributeProjects @colbertlateshow Of course it is covered by the First Amendment. The whole backlash is total bullshit. I consulted with attorneys before even posting it. Exercise your first amendment rights while we still have them.

@LibyaLiberty Why weren’t all thousand Nazis arrested by local Charlottesville PD?  Plenty of video. Plenty of identification and documentation of who these Nazis are. Is Charlottesville PD complicit? Are they dirty?
