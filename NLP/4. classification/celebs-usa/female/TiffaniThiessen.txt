@lorenlong @Jumpstartkids #ReadfortheRecord ditto my dear
@Jumpstartkids @lorenlong Thx so much for having us. #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids @lorenlong Reaching children from all over. And giving them the many fun adventures thru reading #ReadfortheRecord
lol I guess your right. But you def don't have to be an actor to have fun reading #ReadfortheRecord
@CommunityBH @ECEpartners @BrightHorizons So agree with that. Harper gets so into the story when I act it out. #ReadfortheRecord
@joyeseusing No matter how busy you are...Taking 10 mins to read to your child makes a huge impact #ReadfortheRecord
@JumpstartPhilly @lorenlong @Jumpstartkids Very Hungry Caterpillar #ReadfortheRecord
@LakeshoreLM At her age she is all about her independence So I let her pick her books out. She lights up every time. #ReadfortheRecord
@zoobeanforkids @LaurenLong @Jumpstartkids Without a doubt. The feel of a book and turning pages can't be compared. #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids @lorenlong Again, I set my hopes high. Let's say everyone. :) #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids We started Harper early and I saw first hand how much she grew. #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids We make it a fun nightly ritual. We dim the lights, crawl into her bed and read w/ her flashlight. #ReadfortheRecord
@RIFWEB @JWeber617 Here here. #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids I am currently shooting season 5 of my show @WhiteCollarUSA #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids My hopes are high for sure. I want EVERY child in America reading every day #ReadfortheRecord
We also love One Duck Stuck &amp; Do Princeses Wear Hiking Boots #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids @lorenlong Hard to pick an all time fav. At the moment Harper is loving Otis #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids Wasn't hard gettig my daughter to love books. We started at a very young age w/ her. And it continues to b #ReadfortheRecord
@lorenlong #ReadfortheRecord Couldn't agree more.
@Jumpstartkids Bc your goal to reach all children has been so successful and I am excited to be a part of the mission #ReadfortheRecord
@Jumpstartkids @lorenlong Having  a3 yr old this hits close  to home for me.
@JumpstartPhilly @Jumpstartkids Having a 3 yr old myself it hits home for me. It's important that every child enters kindergarten prepared
@lorenlong One of my daughter's fav books for sure. #ReadfortheRecord
