OK, so they might be slightly biased, but hooray @VegWorldMag has given a rave review to a documentary about the faith case for veganism (and which I happen to be in, just saying...)  #prayerforcompassion https://t.co/qgYTQNYQnI
Like everyone else in America, I am blaring the soundtrack of Hamilton into by head this morning to dislodge the chorus of Shallow.
Hollywood must, um, “not like” Glenn Close. Wow.
“Rami Malek won best actor, what a surprise!” said no one ever. #Oscars https://t.co/S6ovLIpYZW
Everybody can stop diacussing “Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper getting it on — yes or no?” and start watching the #Oscars again.
History truly being made tonight at the #Oscars... as my husband hands me the clicker to control the volume. https://t.co/K0h6UTKKc4
Will the #oscars pleeeease pleeeease start soon because the red carpet is so agonizing.
Well, Glenn Close is certainly dressed to win, wouldn’t you say? #Oscars https://t.co/GmGUfUfjhX

Hey @JesseBWatters, and all you folks at @TheFive, vegans don’t want to take away your hamburgers. They want to take away your unconscionable, sadistic cruelty to animals.

Four years ago today. We didn't know her story, her age, or even her breed. All we knew was she had one hour to live. She came home with us instead. Lucky, lucky, lucky us.  #adoptdontshop #rescueismyfavoritebreed https://t.co/pQ6nbQPmdp

Every time someone tells me they're thinking of quitting, I say something almost no one expects. My new @CNBCMakeIt video is live!  https://t.co/L7blm4xDRj
@SixthSensical I already know the answer. It is one zillion trillion.
Quitting to "take a little time off" is almost always phony in business and no different in politics, but worse, imho, because of the public trust issue. Why won't/can't Nikki Haley just state her reasons? (This is a rhetorical question, sadly.)

@Jos3phDiBartolo @IsaacBrown780 @lecrae I urge you to read “The Dominion of Love,” by the great Christian scholar Norm Phelps, for a beautiful, detailed, and deeply persuasive exploration of how veganism is an act of worship and obedience.
@Jos3phDiBartolo @IsaacBrown780 @lecrae Anyone who has been inside a slaughterhouse knows that the mass industrialized torture and painful death of billions of sentient animals a year is not part of God’s design.
@Jos3phDiBartolo @IsaacBrown780 @lecrae Hi Joseph. Would love to walk you (and anyone else!) through Biblical case for plant-based eating. Starting point is not to cherry-pick verses, but take Scripture as a whole, unified testament of God’s merciful love for his entire Kingdom.
@lecrae Please do it! You will feel so much better in your heart and soul, living and eating exactly as God desires, with compassion for all His creation. And you won’t miss a thing, food wise. I promise!!

@JohnStutsman77 God bless you!
@RJTaylor83 Money can’t change dark hearts, but in hundreds of ways (sanctuaries, vet care, education programs) it can help protect the defenseless creatures who are collateral damage.
@SonOfUhGunn Actually, i stopped buying all sorts of “nice” things years ago when I started asking myself “what could this money do for the animals.” So there you go. 🙂
@KosmoKramer2 Them too.
@1962Kiser So very true, unfortunately.
Call me crazy (actually, please don’t) but I’m looking at all the breathless Falcon Heavy coverage this morning and thinking, “Yeah, it’s cool...but imagine if they spent all that money on ending animal cruelty.” #SorryNotSorry 💛 https://t.co/uEctEtjWlo

@mashbusiness A8--&gt; Do something really hard. Ask a trusted co-worker or boss if YOU happen to be the problem. Just saying. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A7--&gt; Another mistake - not facing into fact sometimes an employee is disruptive or not a fit, and must move on. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A7--&gt; Biggest mistake is not dealing w/ the problem directly, with the employee. Awkward, but you have to go there. #BizChats
@Dr_Leah #truth #BizChats
@Think_Tank_Mktg Good luck!
@mashbusiness A6--&gt; Awful truth is, either teach them how to be competent, or just keep your distance. All else too frustrating. #BizChats
Very good advice! #BizChats https://t.co/0PBVTQgkG6
@mashbusiness A5--&gt; Another alternative is a mediated conversation- a great use of HR. A 3rd person can sometimes build a bridge. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A5 --&gt; This is so hard! I'd say go for broke, be blunt, and ask for a "reset," 100% owning what went wrong. #BizChats
@JoynicoleM @mashbusiness A4 --&gt; But would you agree that it's best to go to your boss first? Curious! Thx. #bizChats
@mashbusiness A4--&gt; But def go to HR right away if you feel unsafe, or as if you feel as if a fellow employee might be unsafe. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A4--&gt; First, always best to go to your direct supervisor b4 you go to HR (unless the problem is your supervisor)! #BizChats
@mashbusiness A3--&gt; And even though it will be hard, assume your coworker has good intentions. Stop demonizing them and LISTEN. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A3--&gt; Take it out of the office - your relationship, that is. Get a cup of coffee. Go for a walk. And talk candidly. #BizChats
@talkthattrace @mashbusiness Well said. Talking against the team and the mission -- totally energy-killing. #BizChats
@sylvialafair @mashbusiness So true. Personal stuff can certainly come to work, but it cannot dominate it. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A2--&gt; Other make-me-crazy behaviors are claiming too much credit, doing too little work, and always saying "no." #bizchats
@mashbusiness A2--&gt; The most common no-no has to be the co-worker who kisses up and kicks down (and sideways). Verrry annoying. #bizchats
@mashbusiness A1.--&gt; But healthy work relationships matter because 2 brains in the game -- or 3 or 4 -- are always better than 1. #bizchats
@mashbusiness A1 --&gt; You spend so many hours @ work, if ur not liking your coworkers, life can get very harsh. So there's that for starters.

You have to admit it's a wee bit Orwellian when the Winter Olympics get placed in a city where it does not snow.  #Beijing2022
It's lonely having my #MH370 obsession return without Don Lemon to keep me company.
Maybe finally some answers on fate of #MH370...can't fathom emotions of families. Opening wounds, hopefully, though, for closure.
If NYC can love A-Rod again, Tom Brady and his reputation will be just fine. America's the land of 2nd (and 3rd and 4th) acts.

The thing Bill Cosby could do now, the hard and right thing, is to respect and honor those women by admitting to the world what he did.

All props to #Serena and #Azarenka, but special respect to those of you who can watch #Wimbledon with the sound on.

@mashbusiness @LisaGates1 @jamescaan @MRGottschalk @lruettimann @TrishMcFarlane @dailymuse Thanks to one and all -- great convo!
.@mashbusiness Q8: Best shortcut 4 career success: the hard high road. Love the mission. Live the values. Over-deliver results. #Bizchats
.@mashbusiness Q7: Biggest mistake is thinking tenure counts. “I’ve been here 3 yrs!” Results and values usually matter more. #Bizchats
.@mashbusiness Q6: What do I do well? How can I improve? Do I embrace the mission &amp; demonstrate the values? What’s my runway? #Bizchats
.@mashbusiness A5: A list of your values and contributions is prep enough. Let your performance do the talking for you. #BizChats
@NBP_value_add Avoiding gossip is hard  but essential! #bizchats
.@mashbusiness A4: Any decent boss prefers ideas over sycophancy. Deliver those, teamwork and positive energy, and you’re good. #BizChat
.@mashbusiness A3: Leadership is not about you; it’s about them. Prove you get that by celebrating the best in others. #BizChats
@mashbusiness A2: If you’re not getting performance evaluations, ask. Don’t be scared. Not knowing how you’re doing is worse. #Bizchats
@mashbusiness Q1: Never underestimate how much bosses value unbridled competence: maturity, teamwork, self-awareness, results. #Bizchats
Hi, it's Suzy Welch. So happy to be a part of #Bizchats! @mashbusiness and all.
@ChiantiLomax @LewisHowes Thank you!

Oh please, a presidential debate with both Chris Christie and Donald Trump? You couldn't pay for that kind of entertainment.

Obviously hope they find David Sweat, but personally I'm still kind of more obsessed with someone finding MH370.
Oh if we could all just live our lives in that "Amazing Grace" state of mind, always, there'd be no need for politics.
Can't claim to know the mind of a criminal, but willing to bet a buck or two David Sweat is not going to surrender peacefully.

@JesseThorn Funny!

Daughter blaring @GoVeganRadio throughout house. So subtle.
@Bigloser99 Yes, very different era. Will be fascinating to see how Trump candidacy plays out.
@RandolphBenjamn @counternotions good question and will certainly be a major criticism.
Don't know what to make of Donald Trump news. All I know is media etc mocked Reagan same way + lots of ppl ended up v surprised.
I really didn't want to run today, but then I really didn't want to stop. At least I know I'm not alone with this "condition."
