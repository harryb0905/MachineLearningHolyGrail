Fam, I know I was suppose to play Nina Simone but I truly believe right now that Betty Shabazz needed me more. God Bless her.
Don't wait until your enemies hurt u 2 pray 4 them. I know it hurts but pray 4 them when u pray 4 yourself.
Always tell someone how you feel, because opportunities are lost in the blink of an eye, and regret can last for a lifetime.
Stop comparing yourself to others.
Hating someone is like taking poison but hoping your enemy dies. It only hurts you.
