Congrats @AlexisDenisof for his Emmy Nomination!!!!
😔
At this point I’ll take penalty kicks!
There better be a lot of stoppage time
😳
Can I have some of that spray for my emotions?  #TheWorldCup
Ouch! #TheWorldCup
@MikeAubury no.  I’ve actually been to The World Cup in Germany!
Oh man!!!!
I can’t handle a tie.  #TheWorldCup
Did the ref leave?!
Get it back boys!!!! #ComeOnEnglnd
This will not help my stress levels.  #WorldCup
Enough of that!!!
@debnamkatie oh Grandma!!!
I really think Ryan would look even better with the Golden Boot.  He should get one!  #TheWorldCup
@JoaoHeim true
I’m not the only one that needs to breathe
Thank you England, one more half just like that one please. #TheWorldCup
If only I could fast forward time and keep the scoreboard the same!  #TheWorldCup
@RosieOw that’s why we bribed our kids!
I have to remind myself to breathe!!! #WorldCup
He lied.
@praakashbhusal he lied
@_08supergirl certainly not enough to follow this speed!
https://t.co/yC194IacdW rude
@guilhermejsm okay
@debnamkatie totally!!!!  Don’t hurt his face please!!!
@GerardTeulon 🙂
Telemundo is not delayed and now I can practice my Spanish! #WorldCup
@Julie_554 🙂
@mrsJP17 oh yeah!!! And now Saty cares too (she made the same amount too)
Alexis is watching from Canada and he’s 15 seconds ahead of my game!!! Not fair!!!!
That’s what we want!!
@Julie_554 depends on the goals
Okay England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 you can do this!!!  #TheWorldCup
I wonder if anyone is drinking in England?!?
BTW, when I was explaining the bribe to Keeva I used an example of England winning 2-0. The bribe works!!!
Yessssssss!!!!!! Congrats ENGLAND!!!!! #WorldCup
That guy loves Ryan too.
@Arash92i World Cup extra time
5 again?!?
@axlreznor and lived there for 14 years
Only 5 minutes….
@SoySopita she’s not watching but we are giving her money as well!
@TheBigG77 awwwwww
The Sweden fans could all be super models!
Don’t hurt Ryan!
THANK YOU FOR THAT!!!!!!
@tobias_lehwaldt absolutely!!!
@ilovehimym1998 we gave her on too.  But she’s not as interested
GOOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLL!!!!!!!!! $1 dollar to Keeva!!!
@LinziHCollider I hope we’ll need a bunch!
@daveyeates1 @AlexisDenisof you know it!!!
@SoySopita @AlexisDenisof Thanks for the reminder!!!
Come on England!!! #WorldCup
Happy 4th of July!!! (Please make safe choices)
Wait…does this mean we now have to bribe our kid every time England plays?  Was she the good luck charm?!? 😳
But now I’m sad for Colombia 🇨🇴
YAAAAAAAYYYYYYY!!!!  This proves Ryan Gosling can do ANYTHING!!!  Congrats England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 #WORLDCUP
@impeachdafuhrer and way too smart!
This definitely counts as my cardio
Ahhhhhh
Oh dear
Daddy is giving Keeva a dollar each time England scores.  She cares now.
Not sure I can watch.
That’s NOT the group hug I was hoping for!!!!
Phone is running out of battery!  Good game guys!!  Congrats to whoever wins. I’m definitely going to need a nap after this game!
Just so you know, @AlexisDenisof yells at the TV in an English accent. #WorldCup
This turned into Rugby
@maicon_ieux barely
I can feel myself getting more grey hairs.
Well….I’m happy for all of them but I really can’t have this go on any longer.  Can they just tie please?!?  #TooMuchStress
@itsjescao 😘😘😘
@TedMoroni My hubby is basically English
@photo__crazy I’m on my way!!!!!
5 years
@photo__crazy @dianaluna_a Thank you!!! I hope so too!!
@DrewEvv oh I know!!! I live with it!!!
I think @AlexisDenisof should have taken an aspirin before this game. #NoHeartAttacksPlease
@dianaluna_a I hope not!  I’ve just never been to their Country.  England has my heart!
@HelenaEdel 😭
Maybe they just want yellow cards to match their jerseys?
@mjpthe3rd 😜😂
@robmbrown Agreed!  And maybe a group meeting on playing nicely!
@mrsanglais I’m very tense!!!
@impalergeneral they were asleep (didn’t watch in real time).  I’m surprised we didn’t wake them up tho!!!
Something tells me there won’t be a giant group hug with these two teams after the game.
@sonia_barnes can we just turn it off and call it the end now?!
@AndrewYee2 I have to if I want to keep my husband!!!
GOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLL!!!! #WorldCup  (Our kids have never seen us act like this)
@debnamkatie They were SO GOOD!!!
It’s so cool that England got Ryan Gosling to play in #TheWorldCup 😉
If I could live here, I would! #toystoryland #thankyouthankyouthankyou  #disneyworld @ Disney's Hollywood Studios https://t.co/TnyFKG2Wb0

“@BackpackingDad:You have to make something for every follower or else you violate Twitter's terms of service. I don't make the rules.”yikes
Crafting-way more productive than Candy Crush but also not good for my time with Twitter #missedyoubutimadesomecutethings

@JoeScarpone cuz it never happens.  Everyone is always so nice.  I didn’t know how to react. It was just so rude!
@txcranberry yup!  She doesn’t HAVE to read my tweets.  Just don’t follow me if I bug you.
@filmchick85 thank you!!!
@SomaLynchR5 we start in July :)
Blocked :)
“@aerielle_k: @alydenisof Shut the fuck up.” Why are you following me if you are going to be like that?
“@BrookeJ47:  are you going to live tweet everything he does on twitter ? 😂” I kinda have 2 cuz it’s making me laugh so hard! He’s so cute!
@spencersloane no we are good :). That made me panic laugh though!!!
@spencersloane OMG!!!!! I better check!!!!! Yikes!!!!
He just said “I’m still reading advice about how to de-egg.”
@co_mommy99 me too!!!
“@PaulOutBox: @alydenisof @AlexisDenisof. May need "Tweet Longer" service. :-)” I will NOT be telling him about that!
@josipaorasaanin SO MUCH FUN!!!!!
Umm… @AlexisDenisof is NOT getting the hang of twitter yet http://t.co/thVJQsE9RA
@idaho_panhandle totally not reading THIS ONE!!!
He just said “I don’t think I’m going to be able to finish this.  It’s not like a book where there is an end to it.”
@ShinyWhedonite I told him he should but he said he hadn’t finished yet!
Umm… so @AlexisDenisof is trying to read EVERY SINGLE TWEET he has received.  I may never get to talk to my hubby again :(
@OhHeyCraig sure :)
@THEQueenRickie scream away!!!
@princessapr that woulda been smart.
Picking a photo is proving to be very difficult for @AlexisDenisof
Figuring it out….
“@vikesfan0078: He’s a sexy egg!” We are trying to figure out how to de-egg him on tweet bot but he’s too busy reading all of your tweets!
@kiannak23 I’m trying but I’m not the best person for this. I need Felicia
I just gave him a quick tutorial and @AlexisDenisof is composing his very first tweet.  He is a little nervous.  I know you’ll be kind 😁
Happy Father’s Day to the best baby daddy I could ever ask for @AlexisDenisof (yes, he FINALLY got a twitter account!!! Hasn’t tweeted yet)💗
I am a little concerned that when I pick her up from school her face will be rainbow colored.  Will see soon…
“@rociolewis: @alydenisof where did you get the tray?” Planet Box
“@ReneeHarrison13: @alydenisof Is the strawberry cut like a heart on purpose?! 🙊” ABSOLUTELY!!!!!
@Ashleigh_W76 I have done butterflies as well!
@Blackhawk_Sid I’ll try but these sandwiches take a LONG TIME!!!! ;)
@Gariberta me too!  But at least now I get to do it for her!
@rey_gran zucchini. Usually her lunch is a little healthier but it’s the last day of school so…
@richardwoodger too long to admit!
“@JillMarie617: @alydenisof Please explain the sandwich....haha.” She loves rainbows. So do I!
@BookMama1 no but my hubby is out of town so I made it last night :).
“@sazzy69: @alydenisof Love it. What is the rainbow made of please? x” cream cheese colored with food gel (Duffs brand. Got it at Michael’s)
@Jamybitch zucchini
@JennLStewart cream cheese colored with food gel. Jelly underneath.
The sandwich looks a little like my 4 year old made it but here’s today’s lunch.  Willow would be proud :) http://t.co/FJAvw6B4KS
A guy at the grocery store just asked me if I was the girl from Sabrina.  Never gotten that one before :) Sorry wrong witch.
My 4 year old just looked through a comic book for the first time. She was very quiet, then said “This doesn’t seem like a very happy book!”
And then HAD to do another one… http://t.co/vlSEkU9OEf
So we took this… http://t.co/VGFsSu0mfR
My baby just got to wave at the Presidential Motorcade. Lots of cars with lights and flags, pretty exciting for a 1 year old!
“@BackpackingDad: @alydenisof You're just going because you have a crush on Benedict.” Maybe…
“@tombad2378: @alydenisof sadly I'm in the UK and won't be able to see it unless it's over here as well” In a couple of weeks!
@ChewieNine YAY!
“@mbalsaritchie: @alydenisof Do tell what its like.” AWESOME!!!!
“@FrnzNando: @alydenisof I want to SO BAD. The closest is San Francisco, so I might have to wait until its wide release.” SF is great!
If you are lucky enough to live near one of the few theatres showing Much Ado About Nothing this weekend, please go see it!  I am :)))

@96Becky sweet!  Thank you!!!
@wingster55 no :) it was at work on the side of a stage.
She said he can sleep in her room. I told her he probably snores. She asked why and I said cuz he’s a mouth breather.
@__lostinspace luckily I did!  She has a whole outfit for him but not enough space to tweet.
@delinage hi!  Go to sleep!!! :)
@stepquietly YES!!!  Thank you!!!
@andrew2696 that’s perfect!!! I’ll show her that pic, she will love it!!!
Trying to explain Darth Vader to 3 yr old..pretty hard.  She says he should come live with us and we can make him happy.
My 3 year old saw a pic of Darth Vader &amp; wanted to know why he dresses in all black. She wants to buy him a pink mask &amp; flower underwear.
@LILWEEZY_1994 not sure.  Sorry!
@AmiraSaid I have to read her Cinderella at least three times a day, then Snow White!
@AmiraSaid my 3 year old would LOVE to sleep in that outfit!!!
@Mariaccavmneox love both. Have both.

That being said, no one has even talked to us about adding a season 9.
“@cieraaamillller: is it true that you and Jason are leaving if HIMYM gets a ninth season?” I have NO IDEA where this rumor started!NOT TRUE
@maidebeatles97 because I didn’t see it.
@OB_Minea not sure what the question was.
“@GaryJanetti:Why is it such a major production for you to get through the door with your baby?” What I’m thinking as I try to get thru door
@babyswags THANK YOU SO MUCH for the awesome gift bag!!!  Such cute stuff!!!  LOVE!!!
@THEENGLISHROSEX hi, what’s going on over there?  Anything exciting? ;)

@JaneEspenson YIKES!!!  Feel better soon:)
“@DeadlineTV: CBS’ Nina Tassler Skewers Other Nets, Says She’s “Optimistic” About ‘HIMYM’ Renewal http://t.co/mfanyMk7” Then I will be too!

@DarioLope_s thank you! Whoever took that photo of you is very short.
@JorjLim wouldn’t it be weird if I had the same dream?  I didn’t. Sorry.
“@BellaMystic: Hi @alydenisof  long time no tweet  :)” new baby = less sleep and less tweet
@jennyandteets oh man I need to see that!  It’s slightly alarming that I cannot remember that.
@Zonino_ VERY good question!
@iAM_Willing_ thank you!!!
@1023ESPN_Gator @CobieSmulders
@AngRenzi I’ll talk to him!  He asked for advice but I haven’t had time (new baby).

“Remember when we used to sleep together?” - - Me to my pillow.
http://t.co/LXzbjPKQ
@fearthecowboy I like that!
@metteius started talking about tissue then found myself explaining that it's not the kind you blow your nose with.  Not my greatest moment.
My daughter just asked "Mommy how does my skin stay on?" I knew I shoulda paid more attention in Health class.
There's an imposter tweeter saying they are me.  Don't be fooled, I have the check they don't! + I would NEVER refer to myself as a model!
@chadyLYC true but no one has asks us for a season 9.  Don't know why.
@98RealStella thank you!
@lollerskaterAU that's what I was wondering!
@wendyhagen shoulda!
@MiklCraw4d I KNEW IT!!!  :)
@insaneduckazoid yeah, especially if you'd seen her teeth!!!
So a woman working at CPK said to me "You look great!  Don't listen to the people that say differently."  Umm...?  #wasthatacompliment?
Happy Mother's Day :)
@gingeranne_g that has ALWAYS been my opinion too!!!  Alexis always tries to pitch those names (never really know if he's serious)!
@angrypuppyfilms I agree!!!
“@98RealStella: @alydenisof Any ideas of what you're going to name #BabyDenisof?” not really, any suggestions?
@CatherineAB18 thanks!!!
@trooperMoo You are very kind.  Wrong, but kind :)
@sevenohhthree good luck :)
@_Super_Nina_  oh geez...
I could be doing the math wrong but I think I'm in my 5th trimester.

@KellyJLock yeah, I didn't write that!  So weird.
Congrats to Jessica Simpson!  Does this mean I now have the biggest baby bump in Hollywood?
@98RealStella unfortunately no, sorry.
“@ARKWalton: @BtVSfan96  Alexis Denisof is playing 'The Other' on The Avengers.  Who's 'The Other'?  @alydenisof”  you'll see :)
“@elefantebu: @alydenisof American Pie was the #1 in Brazil last weekend. Congrats! http://t.co/dCe8KyYW”  THANK YOU BRAZIL :)
@THEENGLISHROSEX tweet
@shanisney :)
Today my daughter said "Mommy you look like a big huggable Mermaid!"  I guess that's a good thing to a 3 year old.
Is it just me or does anyone else think that Emily Blunt looks like a dark haired @feliciaday in the posters for 5 Year Engagement?
@MsCeeAngel yes thank you! Someone took it by mistake.
@MsCeeAngel can she help me? :)
@TravelingSoul05 yup. No luck there:(

“@jesswyatt: @alydenisof can you not ask a friend to do it for you?? xx” Hmm... @tomlenk you busy this week?
This is what I wanted.  But not with 'Sati' not 'Lily'! http://t.co/MjpInHQO
I would buy the cake I want and decorate it myself but this months is CRAZY BUSY &amp; I don't think I'll have the time.
You would not believe how difficult it has been to order a birthday cake with a rainbow on it! I mean, it's LA for crying out loud!!!
@feliciaday does that mean you can come to the Premiere on the 19 of March?
My cat sneezes so much I'm starting to think he's allergic to himself!
If I had invisibility as a super power I think I'd use it to sneak bites of people's food at restaurants.
Happy Leap Day!!!
This was just one of the yummy dishes from @MVoltaggio http://t.co/XU9j89WR
@96Becky happy happy!

This must of been for Whitney.  R.I.P. http://t.co/JKcWGiRJ
@borealis_ I've been waiting ALL DAY for her to mention it!!!
It's so quiet today.  It's like everyone is at home watching TV or something.
Turns out that trying on maternity jeans is just as frustrating as trying on regular jeans.
My daughter said "Mommy I have great names for the baby in your belly! If it's a girl, Coco. If its a boy Gaguzzi. It sounds like Jacuzzi!"
YAY!!!  Thank you all SO MUCH!!!  You guys are the BEST!!!
On my way to the People's Choice Awards :). Thank you guys for nominating and hopefully voting for us! Tune in...
@SuperLaurenLove happy birthday, I know where you can get a pony!

The carnival was really fun!  And Sati won a goldfish on her 2nd try!  Put my ping pong throwing skills to shame.

@AmiraSaid does Jason Biggs count? Kidding!
@jennyandteets is that why you never hang out with me?!?
@ImNotYuri thanks!
@KatysMyFirework how will I know?!?
@kennedykatie just heard about that the other day!
On freeway near Stone Mountain but can't see anything but trees.  Are you really a Mountain? (& NO I'm not driving myself!)
@KeeleyFairie yes at least two more seasons :)
@PyramidHead76 :)
@LeeABrian haven't started yet but looking forward to it!
@jennyandteets @biggsjason AWESOME!!!
So we were filming in Monroe GA today and there were two paparazzi but no Starbucks.  How is that possible?
@SeverenS4R you already sent me that tweet, you in a cave? (get it? The echo)
@lilypad_82 almost done:)
@SeverenS4R I am from the south and have been in the heat all day :/
On my way home from work. When I arrive I will be giving a BIG HUG to @tomlenk (right after I kiss my daughter & hubby)!!!!
@AmiraSaid it is thank you!
“@jessie_monster: @alydenisof Is that Alexis in Bryan Singer's 'H+' trailer?” why yes it is, thank you :)
Home now, nite nite :)
Oops let me just state FOR THE RECORD I do NOT know who the Mother is!
“@Roberschenko: @alydenisof himym TT in spain, all of you are great!!! ... who is the mother? XD”. AWESOME & not telling :)
@woowoo76 I think that was the name of them!
For all of you that have offered to take my job, I'm keeping it THANK YOU!  I've worked really hard to not have to work hard :)
@LeeABrian didn't see it but if your ? Was about Thomas Nichols, yes he's back!  Everyone is :)
@feliciaday @simonpegg did Felicia get a private picture?!?
What did I do at work today you asked? Well I ate a popsicle (mango with mint) and that's about it. Okay you didn't really ask.
If I'm not doing anything active but I AM sweating cuz of heat, does it still count as cardio?
@wendywoowho mango mint.
Mmmm.... Popsicle, you are my friend!
But on the bright side it was FUNNY :)
OUCH!!!  I just twisted my ankle and brought @biggsjason down to the ground with me. This is why I shouldn't work after midnight:/
@ThomasKain how about just a reply?
Today is @JaneEspenson 's birthday! She is so funny and smart I wish she would write this tweet! #JaneBday
I've gotta say @biggsjason should not be allowed access to any camera EVER!
I've only slept 3 of the past 45 hours! I'm not even sure this tweet makes sense. zzzzzzzzzz
I might make her dinner for breakfast but oh well!
Hoping to get home from shooting all night for when my daughter wakes up. I've been awake for 24hours, what's a few more :)
@feliciaday does that count as detox for you?
Hey anybody want to help me fix a flat tire (and by help I mean do it for me)?
My daughter just said "I dropped a twig. It's so frustrating!" When did she grow up so fast?!?
Congrats to @Pink on her baby girl!  I LOVE the name :)
@jennyandteets cuz you're with @biggsjason ?
@shondarhimes I'm envious. I LOVE the spelling bee!  Although it stresses me out.
@jennyandteets I'm so confused by that tweet.
Has it happened yet?  I can't tell on my iPhone.
I lost it when I changed something in my profile :(. NEVER AGAIN (hopefully)!!!
Good news my tweeps, I'm getting my verification back!!!
My daughter is already calling it "Hotlanta"
@Mewsen it's a van.  Not too fancy, but appreciated!
We are filming in Georgia so I'm pretty sure Michelle will be southern in this one.  Hope y'all don't mind :)
BTW, I'm not driving myself (that's why I'm able to tweet).
On my way to shoot my 1st day on American Reunion!
@AmiraSaid I'll try:)
“@TheCrapDo: @alydenisof Ils sont à droite parait-il!”. Sometimes I don't understand Twitter.
@jonfarber48
@FrankRisler TRICKY!!!
Could someone please tell me where all the Golden Eggs are in Angry Birds?  I'm missing two & it's driving me crazy!!
Thank you all for letting us know he is having a stroke not a heart attack.  Who knew @tomlenk was so into his hair?!
"I smell burnt toast! Am I having a heart attack?!?" That my tweeps is EXACTLY what @tomlenk just said!!!
He won't allow me to post the pic.
Sitting at hair salon with @tomlenk loving his 'mirror face'!
NOT surprised!!! “@jennyandteets: Did you guys ever see @biggsjason 's bedroom before we met?   yfrog Photo : http://t.co/FCO9C4R”
@twitty_twinss happy happy birthday birthday twins!!!
YAY!
@brandon_michele you must not've watched this season.
Getting close to #HIMYM  Finale time!!!  Can't wait to talk about it (without giving spoilers for the other Countries that are behind)!!!
@wendyhagen you're too cute!!!
@MorLovesMiley cool!
@Maria_Maher I'll do it for free :)
@tomlenk YES!!!  PLEASE!!!!
@SabrinaPeszko blame Angry Birds!
@tomlenk weren't you going to see that with me?!?  What you can't wait a few years (just until Sati is in school)?
I can't wait to be able to talk about it with you guys (and gals)!!!!!
Also, this Monday is the season finale of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  I'm really excited for everyone to see it, so please watch :). Thanks!
@Daryl_in_CLE depends on the day but we are pretty good at them:)
@BeeEllsesser I used Gdiapers for a LONG time and liked them.
Had photo shoot and table read yesterday for American Reunion (AP 4!). SO MUCH FUN! It was like a reunion you would actually want to attend!
Happy Mother's Day Mama's!!!!
@tomlenk coming home today!!!!
@EliKirshtein OR if you eat yourself, game over :(
New episode tonight!  Lily and Robin fun will be had :)
Maybe I forgot to give the Queen my new phone number.
I figured I'd get an evite but no.
@leigha987 13
Okay so I'm starting to think I wasn't invited to the wedding...
That should have been choose.  Damn massage chairrrtrtt
I now chose my nail color based on what my daughter is going to like.  Today it's green.
Waiting for @AnthonySHead to come over. Why are all my English friends so SLOW?
Thank you ALL for the Birthday Wishes! And a BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my favorite little girl :) Sati will always be my best gift EVER! &lt;3
If any of you want to give me a B-Day gift you could follow @EIFRevlonRW_LA and join the event on May 7! Pretty please, with sugar on top:)
Today is the last day I can say my daughters age in months cuz tomorrow she'll be TWO!!!!
@maddiefrey maybe a professional candy taster.  Is that a job?
@JordanGellar no.... :)
@elizadushku :)
Happy St. Patrick's Day!!!  Can someone please tell me why my hubby is talking like a Pirate?
I cannot believe it was 14 years ago today that BUFFY aired for the first time! And I cannot believe you guys had to remind me!
My good friend Josh Radnor wrote, directed & stars in #Happythankyoumoreplease which opens TODAY in NY & LA. PLEASE go see it! I am:)
I owe @Elikirshtein a HUGE thanks for hooking me up with @Mvoltaggio He gave Alexis the BEST BIRTHDAY PARTY EVER! Thank you, thank you!
Happy Birthday to my favorite man, husband & father!!!! (I'm talking about Alexis in case you were wondering)
@emmacaulfield seriously!
“@leeyoonseong:Is it true that u r in American Pie 4???? I can't wait to watch that lol I want to watch it ASAP!!!!” Sorry, not true... Yet
@harrie812 she was actually trying to get the hair out of my face for me.  She used the stuff animal cuz her hands were full.
@jordanmorrissey anything Joss wrote & directed.  Hush, maybe.
@jordanmorrissey c'mon roommate, please?!?
@davey_wayne thanks!  We shall see...
@DiegoAdeG hi!  Is that enough for happiness?
@Lindazilla weird, huh?!?
@davey_wayne but thanks.  I'd tweet about it if it happened :)
@davey_wayne not so fast.  Sorry, but not only have I not read a script but I haven't had an offer either. Right now it's ALL TALK.
“@EvanescentBraea: @alydenisof does Sati want to help mommy clean?” If help means drop food on the floor then yes she helps A LOT!
@BroadwayBaby20 uh...yeah...I don't do that....( very much)
“@onelilhopeful: @alydenisof Damn, girl, your hair looks awesome on the show tonight!! *jealous*” THANKS!
I spend WAY more time cleaning when my hubby is out of town mainly cuz I want our housekeeper to think he's the messy one. Also, I miss him.
@EmelineEcologie that is cute! But you have TONS more being in France!
“@EugeYas: @alydenisof may I in return suggest @charliemcdowell he's hilarious!! :)” yes you may :)
For a funny #ff @yoyoha (but only if you like to laugh).
Happy Valentine's Day or as my daughter says "Happy Val-em-time's day"!
@electraboo that's what started the conversation!!!  Yummy!!
@skayrobe you know it is!!!
@lacey1211 yup!
@LeCincoOcho he doesn't twitter.
Jason, Josh, Cobie & I are having a very intense conversation about pretzel flavors.
@superspecs COOL!!!
@superspecs huh?
Happy Birthday to the lovely yet always busy @MSteenburgen !!!
Note to self: No matter how much of a hurry I'm in, it's not a good idea to peel an orange with my car keys still in my hand.
@Indie_Skies Oh no! I'd say it's time to change the clocks by a few hours ;)
@Tortoisefly that's BRILLIANT!!!
Why don't kids understand that their nap is not for them but for us?
@smgfan2300 thank you!!!
@blueacoustic She'll be two March 24!!!
@SabrinaPeszko She always asks her Dad to sing the "KWALL-AH" song, which is her way of saying Koala. But the song is TieMEKangarooDownSport
@wendyhagen will you do it for me (big smile)?
If she starts to up it it will sound like this "one, two, free, five" cuz that's how she counts.
@Jo_lee1969 What's your question? I hope it's true/false.
Conversation with my daughter- Me:Okay, this is the last one. Sati:One more? Me:No Honey, that was the last one. Sati:Two more? (big smile)
@MichaelAusiello Developing?!? Oh the pressure!!!
@MichaelAusiello I always hear it from you first. Weird, but true.
Happy Birthday to @lilypad_82 !!!
@wendyhagen SO CUTE!!!
@SabrinaPeszko oh man!  We should have done that!!!!
@jennyandteets you're gonna let him go NAKED?!?
She's 22 months. Starting to plan the 2nd birthday party :). Can't wait to stop counting months!
So this week Sati has been saying "Missed you Mommy" when I come home from work. She fills my heart and breaks it all at the same time!!!
@AnnieCristal aww thanks!!!
@ciddiiyimbak uh-oh... Rehab, maybe?
@familyalways04 not yet but we will see...
@i2Haiku well AFTER church ;)

@jbrox08 is it his B-Day?!?  He wasn't at work today.
@doro_bartowski yes!!!!
@MinwaraYana that'd be cool!
“@mattselman: Thanks to Alyson Hannigan (@alydenisof) for lending her hilarious voice to this Sunday’s #Simpsons, “Flaming Moe.”” THANK YOU!

@arolplease I was just thinking that this morning!!!
@labunnywtf SO CUTE!!! & thanks!!!
@SamixMooreXD happy birthday!!!
That was suppose to be AT 3 not A 3, oops.
Why is it that my daughter is finally sleeping until 7 :) but I'm still waking up a 3?!?
@nisadwyz happy 11/1/11 & happy birthday!!!!
@LouisCario no, I like that as well. I'm crazy about everything, REALLY! I love taking care of her :)
@SabrinaPeszko I did.
@ebenjamin30 sounds crazy but yes.  Cuz it's all part of it!
@OwenManc0709 CONGRATS!!!  You did it!  And happy birthday to her :)
“@JulesJBest: @alydenisof What's your favorite part of being a mother?” EVERYTHING!!!  It changed my world in the very best way possible!
@ginaz1207 sorry, no jumping for you. It's a fake :(
@celeb_babyscoop I really shouldn't read the comments :)
@celeb_babyscoop thanks!BTW, as for the comments, she was eating yams(not pureed)& she feed herself most of the snack. I fed her 2 bites. :)
Is it okay to start making Valentine cards tonight or do I have to wait until February?
@familyalways04 next week... I think:)
@CelebrityChitt2 yay you!  Thank you, now I can't wait either! :)
@devilishslysmil will do.
@johnholz you could be the first if you want.
@emmalabizarre good idea!!!
@DiiParrao I've got to work on that.  Or Alexis should!  She does call an umbrella a brolley, so that's a start:)
To those who've asked she is 21 months.
She has done that everyday this week & yesterday she included the dog and the neighbor.
And yes, we spell Satyana with a 'y' but when we shorten it we use an 'i' cuz we liked it better.
My daughter is so lovely! This is a conversation we had... Sati: Mommy happy? Me: yes, very Sati : Daddy happy? Me: yes Sati: Sati happy!
@faywolf have ya tried the ice cream?!?
“@jenmorrisonlive: Looking forward to starting back on HIMYM on monday :) !!” You are?!? WOO!!! I'm so happy too!!!
A little late notice but my hubby is on HIMYM tonight! :)
Happy NEW YEAR to all that are already there!  And Happy almost New Year to the rest of us!!!
Merry Christmas!Hope everyone has a wonderful day tomorrow (or today for most)! If you don't celebrate Xmas, happy everything is closed day!
When I show my daughter a picture of Santa and ask her who it is she says "Humpty Dumpty"
Why didn't anyone tell me that being a parent at Xmas time is even better than being a kid at Xmas time?!?
@emmacaulfield I've found a back whisperer.  He can heal ANYONE!!!
@dewalker happy birthday!  Sorry I'm a little late to the party :)
@ActuallyNPH I really enjoy Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer!
“@MonicaHargrove: @alydenisof is it Danny Strong?” ding, ding, ding, we have a winner!!!
Hint: it's a guy.
It's a guy!
I'm working with an old Buffy friend this week on HIMYM.  Any guesses?
@MrsLawhon I've been there too!  It'll be worth the wait!!!  Good luck!!

If you lift your right foot & make clockwise circles then draw the number 6 in the air with your right hand, your foot will change direction
Okay... Hi to everyone who said I could say hi to them (including France). Now I have to go work out:( tweet ya later!
Hello my tweeps! Long time, I know:(. The iPhone 4 won (cuz I'm a sucker) & I just got my twitter app back. Too bad I've got nothing to say.

One of the girls on The Real World Hawaii is an extra in the bar today!
The votes are kinda a tie.
Any thoughts on the Droid X vs Iphone 4?
@wkd2639 being a Mommy:))))
Going back to work next week = going back to Twitter. If only AT&T worked!
The place Alexis & I went on our honeymoon is on The Bachelorette.  DAMN, now I have to watch The Bachelorette!!!

@heroesinvain Happy birthday x's 25!!!
If anyone is looking for my heart, I gave it to the elephants at the San Diego Zoo.

So nice RT @KarenWilliamson: @alydenisof voted for you as favorite new mom on popsugar.com's poll. Even with spit up in your hair.
The funny part of the spit up is I didn't bother looking at my hair cuz I didn't want to be late, now she's going to sleep through the class
@saralizmoore it's called RIE. Its wonderful!  You just let the babies BE.
Sitting outside of baby class with a sleeping baby. And I'm certain I have spit up in my hair. Jet lag sucks!

@vampwix happy birthday.... Early!  Hope it's fun!!!
Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!! I am BEYOND thankful for my first Thanksgiving as a Mommy.

@DMBastian we are going to friends but need to bring a pie.
@IMBellaYahya hi
If I were at home we would make it ourselves. But in a hotel, without a stove... might be a little difficult.
New Yorkers, where can I get a GREAT pumpkin pie for tomorrow?
Wow, i hope you dont lose followers for that! :) RT @faywolf: coincidentally... my fave movie from 1987 to 1991?  Mannequin.

Stella McCartney for BabyGap just got A LOT of my money!  I bought everything I could get my hands on (even some boys clothes). Adorable!
@Lifeisstr8guy good morning...in the afternoon.
@Lifeisstr8guy what?
@LorenSorensen So CUTE!!!
Pooh looked taller in person & very much LIKE a person. Weird, huh?
Must resist waking baby just to dress her up as a bunny!!!
I had a celebrity spotting earlier today.  I saw Winnie The Pooh walking to lunch!!!
Dear Halloween, I can't wait for you so I'm going to start celebrating you NOW.
Yes, her nails are Pink.  Not paint, Soft Claws. They keep her from destroying the furniture!
http://twitpic.com/mrqw4 - Here is the tail eater!
My cat is making it hard to decorate for Halloween.  She is eating the tails off paper rats.  It's like she KNOWS they are rats!!!
I'm on ELLEN today! I kinda love her A LOT!!!

Happy Birthday @Katieandmegan!!! ( I know this is still happening)
That last post was apparently too late. I'm a little slower these days:(
Please consider RT: Each time you use hashtag #beatcancer 2day, it's $0.01 to cancer research. http://tinyurl.com/yjfy5jc
@OrliP Is it too late?!? Happy Birthday!!!!!!!!! :)
My weekend starts NOW!  Love having Friday off:)
@RLH92 you should have!!!
@j9garner I'm waving right now!
@midorinosaru tell your friend thanks from me... I enjoyed the bagel!
@promogrrl wish the Zoo didn't close at 4:00 yesterday, but still had fun.
@j9garner yep, doing a MasterCard ad here in Indy. It's cold! (Indy, not MasterCard)
My Marriage is 6 years old today!!!  Man time flies when you are with the BEST HUBBY EVER!!!
@didaraslan never been but my Husband LOVED it there.  We have to go someday!!!
I want @tomlenk to be here!
Speaking of Buffy...Alexis has a date with Joss tomorrow.
@karenfranke your telling me!!!!??!?
Just had our "lunch" break at work (@10:00pm), what show is this?!? These are Buffy hours!!!
Happy to say nobody used the earplugs!
We had a wonderful time! The flight home was okay. We were VERY tired. But saw @tomlenk in Rock of Ages last night...SO MUCH FUN!!!
So nice to be home:)
About to teach Satyana the art of shopping in New York.  VERY happy!!!
Just watched @Feliciaday on Jimmy Fallon.  So CUTE!!!
@Feliciaday didn't say Jude Law was on the show before you?!?
What happened to my hair color?!? It looked like 4 different dye jobs!!!
I mention Twitter on Letterman!
FYI I did drink the tap water. It tasted like boiled bugs (or at least how I imagine boiled bugs would taste)!
I'm on Letterman in a few minutes!
Is it okay to drink the tap water in New York?  My Hubby says yes, @Feliciaday says no.
Oh... AND I get to see @tomlenk!
Just took Baby to Central Park. Going to do Letterman tonight.  I LOVE New York!!!
Hello New York!!!  Flight went well.  Baby could not have been better!!! Thanks for the advice:)
pls RT. typhoon victims in philippines in dire need of rescue/food/clothing. pls help thru redcross: http://bit.ly/1VhJak
We are going to NYC!!! Any good advice on air travel with a baby?
Wow!!! RT @Nickolz: @alydenisof did you know they made a twitter (and a blog) for Alexis character? @SENDanielPerrin
In later episodes.
Been SUPER busy but wanted to give a late (sorry East Coasters) shout out to watch my Hubby on Dollhouse tonight! He will have more to do...
My baby is 6 months old today! How did THAT happen?
Congratulations to Sarah & Freddie on their new baby girl!!!
@michimort cuz it wasn't Josh. I am the only HIMYM cast member that is on Twitter.... for now:)
http://twitpic.com/iu9lo - Here's a pic from my seat at the Emmys
Hi everyone!!! Thanks for all the nice tweets! Verified Account = WOOOOOO!!!!!
http://twitpic.com/iinl9 - This photo was taken by @catdeeley
Just saw a breifcase handcuffed to someone!  It must be the results!!!
In Green room now.
Crazy!!!!!!!!!!
http://twitpic.com/ii5sy - Check out my BLING!!!
In the car!!!
Thanks to www.narayanbeauty.com for pretty nails!
http://twitpic.com/ihi7h - My toes are ready...
Why did my first tweet retweet?!?
@katieandmegan how does your hair look?
BTW I'm going to try to get some new followers today, but just know you are my favorites. :)
I'll post a pic later!
The vanity process has begun... I feel like Cinderella!
I have the BEST HUBBY EVER! He took baby duty this morning & I slept 'til 10!!! Now she's napping & I miss her:(
Or is it Gervais?
My seats are two rows away from RICKY GERVIAS!!! I won't be able to contain my love for him!
Had rehearsal for Emmys today!
@deedee_145 @vballcoach19 @heyrachael @alydenisof here is a reply with nothing interesting in it!:)
@angeliquecrosby Thank you!
@SharkGoddess It looked like I was yelling at you.
@SharkGoddess I didn't need to use an !
@SharkGoddess I don't know!
@angeliquecrosby no. I don't do facebook.
@FADKOG ;)
Hope @tomlenk had a great show!!! I miss him SO much:( But will get to see him soon:)
http://twitpic.com/i3rka -
Going to try to tweet from the Emmys!
Thank you all for the links. Makes me think twitter should have a Website Wednesdays for favorite websites!
@MorbiusKromwell pre-made
Anyone know a website for kid friendly Halloween Decorations?
@jordanmorrissey Did your cousin just get mad at you?
@WeirdMeta I can't get him to join. Sorry...  I'll still try.... :(
@erinjcruz I guess it was and I won! :)
@willowism no bets, too bad.
@toriaella She did indeed!
Saw @elizadushku today.  She said she would tweet about it first... looks like I won!!!
@christinabox5x5 Nice. Next time you come to the set we can compare notes:)
@Ilovesn They teach you how to do it on a Baby Doll.  You use two fingers.
@SoundGuy Your friend needs to take a better class!!  There is A LOT you can do!!!
@mayclem72 Our instructor said it has gotten easier than it was years ago.
@Tlenze She's very smart!
Took a Baby CPR class today. I will sleep better now!
@tomlenk You are taking the whole "City that never sleeps" thing REALLY seriously!!! Miss you!!!
Thank you all!!!
Nope, SONIC BOOM!
Did we just have an earthquake?
@Meg_M_Miller happy B-day!!!
@DonaldJr oops!
@JLanie how can I do that?
@ledz fake
Sorry no tweets from set this week:( I blame AT&T for bad service on the FOX lot.
@Jasongn But LOVE LOVE LOVE them. And kudos for the prompt deliveries!! When are there going to be more new colors?
@Jasongn I LOVE gDiapers!!! Weird thing happened with a couple of the latest batch, a couple of the diapers had red tape on the top of them.
@Jesshazel I'll reply to you as well... Does this count?
@aimee_liz88 The kids wouldnt learn much & I'm sure you would get fired!
On my way to Entertainment Tonight set.  WAY sleepy!!!
@southernweather That's why I ALWAYS turn the camera off when I nurse her!
@madcatdisease cute!!!
@Geehak she is having trouble too.
@JLanie It's only 11:25 here.
Fixed it. Sometimes electronics need a strong pat on the back! I feel like Fonzie (please no tweets asking "who is Fonzie?")
My Baby Monitor is acting VERY weird! It's got 3 different pictures. 1 normal, 2 looks like a negative & 3 blinking black and white.
I'm also going to try to mention it on a live interview at the Emmy's Red Carpet.
I'll take a picture of myself with my username and see if that works. But I'm gonna wait until the next time I'm wearing make-up! VANITY:)
I am trying to get a verified account by mentioning my twitter name in every interview I do.  Just mentioned it to People Magazine.
@j9gem SO TRUE!!! :)
Feed the BABY, feed the DOGS, feed the CAT, feed the FISH(in the pond), feed MYSELF. When did I become the bottom of the food chain?
@tomlenk BOOOOOO!!!!!  LA NEEDS you Tommy!!!! We miss you already:(
Sorry tweeps I did not get Jason today. He did say he would but didn't do it today. His loss.
I feel today will be the day I get Jason Segel to join twitter!  We have next week off so I better!!!
Well I guess when I tweet pictures you all need to lie down before you look at them.  I've noticed some of you look tired...
@kittylair yes
Why are my pictures sideways?
For the record @Jason_segel is a FAKE!!! Still working on getting the REAL Jason to twitter on his own.
@migston26 @ahasaka yes
Jason is still on the fence about getting on Twitter.  He thinks it might get him into trouble... with the ladies!
That's Jason's first REAL tweet!  He said to say he's single ladies!!!
http://twitpic.com/fdtxf -
I just need SPANX to make my dress!
I ate 4&1/2 of them.  They were MINI cupcakes so they don't even count!!!
@jdeuberry she was guessing the gender of my baby (rerun).
http://twitpic.com/fa1v2 - How am I going to fit into my Emmy dress when these are at work?!?
@TheEllenShow It was hard not to tell!!!  And your final guess was wrong... SORRY:( But I had a blast!!!
5 months today!!!
@thussung Looks real to me!
@philiplord How's the Meatball?!?
@CallMeLivi here's hoping!
Tons of YES, two no
@daisiesdaily funny
Trying to set up Twitter on my iPhone . Did it work?
@srellabr That goes without saying!!!
Dad's too. :)
Back to work. Twitter has been neglected, sorry!  I have even MORE respect for all the working Moms out there, it's hard (& I have it EASY!)
@Sammeh_ They are trying to make it work:)
@Shamikebab 4 as of now.
@Maxx88 I start HIMYM on Monday!
Alexis is shooting his first day of Dollhouse right now!
Making me giggle that I have a dentist appt at 2:30. Get it... TOOTH HURTY!  I'm 6.
@marykae That would be VERY strange.
@canaussiegirl My thoughts EXACTLY!!!
The fans that run along the side of the road REALLY stress me out!!! What if they fall in front of one of the bikes?!?
@FL1CK_m Tivo! Still have the last one left.
Does watching the Tour De France count as cardio?
Please go to www.theanimalrescuesite.com and click the purple box "fund food for animals for free' It helps feed abandoned animals. THANKS
Thanks for all the CONGRATS messages!
I found out the show was nominated, then got pooped on while changing a diaper. The PERFECT balance of life!!!
Thank you!!! Being lied to never felt so good:)
@LDfreedomTB Thanks!!! Tweet me anytime you want!!!
Okay, REALLY don't need the "I was a baby/not born" comments. Was feeling good 'til all those comments came in :(
I do love how helpful everyone on twitter is when I have a problem.  Where were you all when I was in High School?
I put in a request for a verified account but it said it did not work.
@rachlanger If I had more time I'd do it for you:)
@jasedepuit WHAT?
@AmberFresh Exactly!!! Like I would EVER list my jobs in a tweet.
@jaycee419 Just through me...
@FBK How do I do that?
@HeatherIrvin Thanks for letting me know!
There is fake twitterer saying they are me. @iAlysonHannigan is NOT me!!!
I love when my dog burps. Is that weird?( ...I guess what's weird is tweeting about it.)
Thanks for all the nice things said about the CBB picture. Picking a mattress with tired baby=DIFFICULT.
@ItsTimCox Conceder yourself followed:)
@ItsTimCox Please give everyone a GIANT THANK YOU!!!
@ItsTimCox You can also say that those were the first autographs I've signed since becoming a Mom. For whatever that's worth:)
@ItsTimCox Cool!!!  I hope the Slayathon get to make a lot of wishes come true!!!
@howdywho2 Thanks!!!
Some people think this is Alexis' twitter. He doesn't tweet....yet.
@entertainme09 What's a TWoP award?
If you don't want to hug the person then try to rub their nose for them in case it itches.
@christinabox5x5 gDiapers are a washable diaper that has a plastic-free insert that is flushable or they break down in 50-150 days.
Wow, I just made a lot of noses itch. Too bad I didn't think of anything better. How about... It's hard not to hug the next person I see:)
@Sombrera Thank you for the link. I just learned about the Strawberry thing yesterday (WAY too late). Have now cut them out of my life.
It's really hard NOT to rub your nose when it itches. Try it.
Goodnight everyone!  Thanks again!!!
@lmcleman YES and I LOVE them!!! It's also nice to know that my baby's diapers won't still be in a land fill when she has kids!!
@tomlenk It's the only last minute gift I could think of:)
@nmau We are good to go. Season 5 starts in shooting in a couple of months.
I like the new title that @LauraSiebert just gave me... Twimp (a twitter pimp).
Nice, @tomlenk is up to 7000 followers!! Thanks for helping!!!
@GiveChase Wonderful!!!  Might be teething or she might not like that I had a lot of Strawberries, not sure.  But still wonderful.
@thebatman Just get ready for the most love EVER in the world!!!  And CONGRATS!!! & G diapers are great!!!
It's working! Thanks everyone:)
@1stLadyJen No, not Neil. But they aren't claiming to be him in their profile.
@BluWhskE Thank you!!!
@shawlaw Yes indeed!!!
Happy Birthday to @tomlenk!!! Let's try to give him more followers as a B-day gift!
@PLDM I'm no expert but you may want to call you Doctor:)
@stevekaw Got that from my Hubby. Cuter when he says it!
Question to the Parents out there: What age does teething start?
@feliciaday does that mean you are tweeting whilst driving? I've seen how you drive, stop tweeting!:)
@b_waydiva I don't know but I seriously doubt it.
@bubblevisions I like the way you think!
@feliciaday BUSTED!!! In Santa Monica and didn't call me!!! I like burritos:(
@PerezHilton I was going to vote for you for an Emmy nom but I can't vote for hosts. Guess you need to start acting.
It's a little rainy today, so no walking.  Mother Nature WANTS us to go shopping!!!
For the peeps that asked... She is 11 weeks today. I was saying 2&1/2 months but now I'll say weeks 'til she's 3 months.
She's not crying but she's not napping!  Time to go shopping maybe?
Bad idea when you have a baby number 1... Having built in bookshelves installed during baby's nap. Yup, that's my day.
Can someone please tell my hubby that the terminology is "tweets" not "twits"?!?
I think I've been duped.  I'm sorry but that's not Charisma. My bad. I guess I owe about 5000 apologies.
a BIG hello to @CharismaCH !  Another Buffy alum on twitter!!!
#feliciadayrumors number 2... @feliciaday is my baby!!!
#feliciadayrumors number 1... @feliciaday told Pillsbury to put LESS icing in with the cinnamon rolls!(see what I did, making u hungry =fun)
What are all the #feliciadayrumors about? Should I start one?
Sorry if I've made you hungry. My bad:(
I should have named my baby Pillsbury. I'm pretty sure I have them to thank for the last 10 pounds of my pregnancy weight.
BTW cinnamon rolls for dinner is fun!
Well I've had a lot of responses that agree with me. We might need to find the little dough boy and push his belly 'til he caves. HEE-HEE
Why doesn't Pillsbury put more icing for the cinnamon rolls? Don't they know I'd rather have more icing and one less roll?!?
I'm still getting those password emails!  3 so far today.
Adios! ..... OH WAIT, it's still me!!! Promise!!!
Well if you see any tweets from me that are in another language, I've most likely been hacked. Most likely.
Does anyone know why I just got an email from twitter telling me how to reset my password when I haven't forgotten my password?
Dr is sick. The check-up is next week now. Exercise can wait another week also:)
Baby's two month check-up tomorrow. Maybe it's time to think about losing the pregnancy weight? At least I've stop wearing maternity jeans:)
Amy Acker coming over to meet our baby girl!!! FINALLY (she's been out of town this WHOLE time)!
H8 SUCKS!!! Equality please.
My hubby was too cool back then!!!
thanks @rural_juror for reminding me of http://bit.ly/AZ7VK
I haven't watched TV since March 23. I'm about to see if my TIVO has exploded yet.
@amy_is_me I got the most responses from Aussies, so they got the credit.  Sorry UK:(
@jennreneemusic I'm from GA so it's Krispy Kreme Doughnuts for me.
@ThomasDrury yes check my picture with Felicia, I'm not the fake Alyson.
@tomlenk Why did you have to tweet about doughnuts?  Now I won't be able to think of anything else! Remember our 'doughnut diet' on Buffy?
@bubblevisions oops. I'll do the hash tag tomorrow. That's what I get for trying to cheat the system.
Did I do that right?
Okay Australia, my follow Friday(ish) @tomlenk, @katieandmegan and my Dad @Al_Hannigan. Ooh that feels good!!
I was excited to do my first "Follow Friday" then I realized it wasn't Friday. Hope I can remember tomorrow!
If a bird poops on your shoulder and you  have a baby, just say it's spit up.
Is the 11th commandment Thou shalt not wake a sleeping baby?
@tomlenk wants 5000 followers. Can anyone help a guy out? He's very funny.
@katieandmegan Josh isn't on twitter and I'm fairly certain that's not Jason either.
@Kirsty_H_99 British citizen that is.
@Kirsty_H_99 I can't sign cuz I'm not a citizen.  If I could I would. Sorry.
@webbtech she's a good sleeper but still wakes up to feed at least twice a night.  But it seems good to me.
Baby is asleep after her first earthquake. She was fine but looked at us like we were crazy as we ran out of the house with her in our arms.
@KatWand RT@katieandmegan are the sister's I always wanted but never had.  So now I've made them mine (don't tell them though.)!!
And @tomlenk!!!  My night is made!!!
Welcome @katieandmegan!!!  It's about time:)
My Sister-in-law is visiting:) She has already changed two diapers & been spit up on.
Happy Mother's Day!!!
Heads up: @joshradnor is a fake.  Josh does not twitter.  Still waiting to hear from Jason.
@entertainme09 I'm starting to think @jasonsegel is not really Jason as well.  Prove me wrong Jason!
I'm starting to forget what hot food tastes like.  Thank goodness for Sushi.
I want one of these...  http://tinyurl.com/cw2phl
@Jason_Segel you should follow your tv wife (me).
http://twitpic.com/4cz3s - Me and @feliciaday being eaten by a plant.  Here's my new haircut :)
I'll figure out the picture thing tomorrow when felicia visits me.  She is going to give me a Twittorial:)
Got my hair cut today. I can see again!!! No more hats for a while.
when do parents go from telling their baby's age in weeks to months? what about months to years? I'm 421 months old.
Must sleep now.  Sleep when baby sleeps, right?
@MorganDreamer Yes, PLEASE!  We love Italy!!! Driving there is stressful.  We almost crashed a few times, but the food makes it worth it!
@oziangelmal Alexis wants to move there, or New Zealand.
@bloodyblond Katie!!! You're 21!!! Ahhhhh, I'm old!!! miss you too!!  Come visit us!!!
Must return to life now.  Don't want to offend the Mom-in-law. Plus, miss my baby...it's been at least ten minutes!! (okay, I'm needy )
@Jeloki I'll start feeding her that way! :)
@oye00 Not easy to outsmart the paps!  But we did it that day!
@stevescurlygirl Satyana, like Tatiana but with the S.
@buffybaskey  Wasn't a sling.  Just a bunch of blankets cuz of the breeze.
@sylasp maybe I can wash my car with my breast milk? Saves water, ya know.
@CallMeLivi I hope she won't want to.  I want her to have a normal life (which is proving to be difficult with the paparazzi following us)
@mikkibelle Alexis does a fantastic Australian accent!  I'm fairly certain Satyana's first word will be didgeridoo.
Mom-in-law visiting, so I have a moment to tweet.... but have nothing to say. I need to wash my car.
@JanetDSestrilla sorry about the song.
@KristinHayes Satyana is 4 weeks today. She was the best Birthday present I've ever had!!!
I've been puked on, peed on, pooped on and I've never been happier in my life.  Babies are amazing!!!
How can a person so small make so much dirty laundry?  And why is doing laundry suddenly so rewarding?
Just figured out where to find your messages... I'm a little slow these days.  I blame sleep deprivation!  Thanks for your congrats!!!
I want to tweet, baby wants the teat... she wins.
Hi Nathan!  Now I know two twitterers (or is it twitts)?
that's what Alexis is singing to our baby!
