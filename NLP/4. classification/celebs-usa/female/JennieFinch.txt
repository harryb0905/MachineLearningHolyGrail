This. Game. #WCWS @espn @NCAAsoftball
@tmas32 2 of those pitches could of been called strikes. #UmpireHasAHittersZone
Game 1 was big, now it's HUGE. Almost crucial w/ both pitching staffs burnt. Casey says in baseball it would be a catastrophe. 🤣 #WCWS
#batbusters #wcws #BusterBall 💪🏼
Casey-You're gonna bring in ur starter that started 3 hours ago?? #TypicalBaseballPlayerTalk #HeDoesntKnow #SoftBALLERS @espn @NCAAsoftball
Lead off walks rarely end well. 🤒

Such a beautiful story about @BaileyLandry26 -Thank you for sharing. @LauraMRutledge https://t.co/NmNvs66qAJ
@UCLASoftball Part 2: However, this is very common in baseball (not that it's right). She let emotions go too far today, but she's still the 🐐
@UCLASoftball Not celebrating or saying what she did was right- it was completely wrong. I'm sure she'd admit that about the contact. Her team responded.
That was for #LisaFernandez @UCLASoftball 💪🏼💙 https://t.co/Xfht5sMcGA
@JennyDaltonHill @MicheleSmith32 Coaches are teaching players to get hit?!? I agree, hitters shouldn't be able to armor up. Pain is a deterrent. Earn your way on base.

@natashawatley29 love you &amp; loved having you at short behind me! #GoodOleDays
It takes a WHOLE team to Win it all! OU has rode #1 pitcher in #WCWS &amp; now #2 on the mound in the Nat'l Champ Game #AlwaysBeReadyForTheCall
Pitcher &amp; Catcher= Battery  We studied together, prepared together, held each other accountable, called our own game= Nothing sweeter!!!
When I took the signal on the mound from my catcher I wanted to know/see that my catcher &amp; I was on the same page! #WCWS #AntiArmBand👈🏼😂
I can't imagine looking to an armband for a signal- we've lost one of the most special bonds in the game between catcher &amp; pitcher.
What do y'all think? Can @OU_Softball pull it out tonight? Or will @Auburn_Softball force a game 3? Sooners on fire-Auburn feisty as can be!

Familia talking with his pitching, I was ready for the ninth! 💪 #WorldSeries Can the @Mets pull this out? I hope, I want 2 watch more games!
Yes, good throw would of had him. No doubt. However, it almost looked like an after thought-when THAT runner is key! https://t.co/N1UrMGkh4t
Yes, but I think you have to pull him after the walk. #ShortLeash #RunnerGetsOnYouPullHim  https://t.co/5LDEbYFjIo
Coach is back. 😂 As a first baseman the priority is that runner on 3rd NOT the out. When you see him break to home you give up the out.
Collins never should have approached @MattHarvey33 in between innings. #JustMyOpinion #LetHimBe #OnlyAddedMorePressure #Mets
Yes, preach! 👊 https://t.co/UdV4Q2aAPz
#Harvey #Gamer "No, way. No, way. I'm going back out there!" #YouGottaLoveIt #DontTakeTheBalLAwayFromMe @Mets #WorldSeries
You gotta stick with Harvey to close it out! @Mets #WorldSeries He's earned it, on 🔥! #CaseyJustMadeFunOfMe #NowYourACoach 😂😂
#Harvey set the tone early for the @Mets tonight. He brought the heat &amp; is still bringing the heat. #MoundDominance

&amp; we are in for a treat.... Just as we have been all #WCWS Can Michigan pull this off?
&amp; Why I was not a fan of the props in the #WCWS Fun? Yes, but it takes away from the excellence &amp; respect in &amp; of our game. #JustMyOpinion
Was thinking the same thing at the beginning with all the baseball comparison. Excited to say, people know our game! https://t.co/9EAmNOLOh3
