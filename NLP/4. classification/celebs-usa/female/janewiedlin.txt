@gogosguy @TheDebr1 @agneimanis @Kathy_Valentine I don’t even know what Eagle Rock is! Also, I am not sure I knew Universal holds our masters too. Luckily, our rights are all reverting back to us soon! They can’t keep our records forever. We made them. #Artists

HEY my foot fetish friends. 👠 I just added 2 pairs of previously worn shoes to my online store. Proceeds go to the various animal rescue groups I work with. :)  https://t.co/ZNJORcfHlO
HEY FRIENDS!! You know I love to raise $$ for the various animal rescue groups I work for. 😍🐶  I've just added some really special items to my online store. Give them a look: https://t.co/q3sFX0SYVW https://t.co/CcS918ehgL

@Brooklywood The Impossible burger is the best, but depending on the restaurant you have it at, it can go from “a viable alternative” to “are you SURE this isn’t cow meat?”!
@jonwurster @officialgogos @sparksofficial It’s pretty awful.
@notMPA That would be me.
@Jim_Jordan Oh, Gym.
@UberFacts Is me.
@rexthetvterrier Yup. Too bad I’m not a witch; I’d curse them.

@timekeeper1346 @RF_P0TUS Pretty sure a “Lert” is a type of African antelope, on the Endangered Species List. Thing One and Thing Two have killed lots of them.
@thatgirlinsb @RF_P0TUS “Shitler”????? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
@stevensmcdonald @ACNewman I remember “smog days” when the air was so bad we didn’t go to school. Also, an ailment we called “The Smogs”, when your lungs hurt so much you had to breathe really shallowly and not exert yourself at all.
@KevinPo41997393 @Kathy_Valentine Yes! Thank you for raising your sons thoughtfully!
@StallmansBeard I was thinking the term “rush hour” sounds like it would be something really great and exciting.
@David96601481 Right?  And it isn’t “anti-men”, it’s anti men who think they have the right to control women.
@douglastate @Kathy_Valentine Agreed!
@KevinPo41997393 @Kathy_Valentine Nobody thinks (or says) you’re all “tosspots”! I LOVE good men. Unfortunately, there are plenty of men that think they have the right to control women and their bodies. That’s not right.

@walterowensgrpa Do you think Ethel Pat (your wife) would let you take a second wife? I really admire you, Walter (Owen’s Grandpa). Also, I think Owen (your grandson) would like me.
@ACNewman Every punk I knew (including myself) in 1976 had transitioned from glam to punk. One rebellious type of music to the next. Musically different, but ideologically the same (“Fuck you Mom &amp; Dad”).

@Ka47340374 Intensive therapy and proper diagnosis/medications.
@sizzaruh Bipolar. Previous diagnosis (1973) was Clinical Depression. Different brain chemistry.
@mr_mjb1960 The exterior world has gotten so bleak, I believe it exacerbates what lives inside.
@JosephHaas2 It has been an ENTIRE year of not feeling darkness on the inside! I am so grateful! Even if it took this long!
@blackcross7 You are not alone. You CAN feel better, I promise you! 💜💜💜💜💜💜
@chantalclaret Thank you my darling! NEVER thought I’d live this long and am thrilled and grateful to feel happy to be alive.
@HakkerShorts @sizzaruh Therapists are psychologists who help you through honest conversation. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who diagnosis you then figure out what types of treatment and meds can improve your illness.
@AlanHunterMTV Man, he really has Stockholm Syndrom, doesn’t he?
@cb831 Yes. It is like a new chance.
@JonesyJ49 2X per week incredible therapist, 2X per week psychiatrist, a CORRECT diagnosis, working w doctor finding the exact right combo and dosage of meds for me.

@dodo Fantastic story and message! “Go save a dog, it’ll change your life!”
@sizzaruh Thank you. I am too. I never dreamed i could feel the way I do since getting A LOT of help.
@soulsrvivor2001 Yes. #SurvivorsReachOut xoxoxoxo
@Caissie This is an important idea. There were times I was so depressed I couldnt even get out of bed to pee &amp; would lay there for hours in agony trying to work up the energy to move. Last year my ex saved my life bcuz HE reached out to ME when I thought I was totally alone in the world
I’m so upset about Tony Bourdain’s suicide. I’d been a fan since Kitchen Confidential. I know for a fact that things can get better, no matter your age. With help, one year ago I stopped having the suicidal thoughts that had plagued me EVERY DAY since I was eleven. #ReachOut

@24yankfan @Kevin_From_NJ We check to see if the dog will be okay with living w cats. The greyhounds are taught on the track to chase a small furry object. Some of them will continue to display that behavior in a home. So those that do are placed in a cat-free home.

@EllenAd29078703 @vsena007 @AndreaMadruga1 You are so right. And the people that defend it always use “tradition” and “culture” as their excuses. So maybe we should go back to human/animal sacrifices, infanticide, and all the other horrible things humans did in the past.

@buckinflynd @MarthaQuinn @officialgogos @HOHmusical Men have legs too, and also, presumably know how to use them.
@buckinflynd @MarthaQuinn @officialgogos @HOHmusical I love a dress on a man!
@17days @VeganAri But where can you buy it? It’s $40 a carton on Amazon (w shipping)!
@RealGwot Me too! And if he becomes president, will we have a MOTUS (Mother of The United States)?
@notMPA @MarthaQuinn LOL!!!!
@jeremykushnier I’m recovering from my tour but will see you guys Weds! Also, Tadich Grill has been in biz since 1849. Who says California has nothing old?!
Oh boy. It just gets more and more convoluted. And exciting. But I still fear that NO MATTER what crimes these  people committed, they will suffer no consequences. https://t.co/mMjNJLFGc8
@jeremykushnier @HOHmusical Tadich Grill for a meal! My fave SF restaurant. Quirky with delicious food and charmingly old-school waiters.
@MarthaQuinn @officialgogos @HOHmusical With a wildly colored top! (Or a yellow top will totally match the HOH logo!)
@MarthaQuinn I love BOTH so much! But I’m going to go w the pink pants. So cool.

I don’t need it for “invoicing clients”, I need it to easily organize incoming and outgoing money in a way that i can hand over to the tax dude every year.
@gantwick Yes. It was way too hard.
@imcorinnemec @SammiRobin My copy arrived! I was surprised to see that it’s in script form, but I’m looking forward to reading it!!
Does anyone have an app or online site that they can recommend for amateur bookkeeping that is seriously easy to understand? I’m with #GoDaddy bookkeeping now but the owner is a big game hunter so I want to quit them. One that’s suitable for business but isn’t complicated. Thanx!

@neilhimself I predict carpal tunnel syndrome in your future. #ItsGoodToBeKingUntilItHurts
@Drubulous The shelter thinks he is a rat terrier mix, but i think he might have some border collie in him because of his eyes and his smarts. He looks just like our bc Pawl Stanley but w a short coat.
@EnchantdForrest @CatStaggs @pleasantgehman @exenecervenka It was a blast!

@SpiritAirlines @ranchodelaluna @SpiritAirlines I DID message you and all you did was tell me your stupid policy about charging for ANY baggage checked or even carried on.That should be on EVERY travel booking site so everyone knows NOT to fly you. $55 to carry on a small bag. #Cheaters
I adopted a new furkid! His name will not be Spike. Thank you SF SPCA for bringing this lovebug into my life! https://t.co/FqkJhEqpDh
@biggayicecream @SpiritAirlines I’d have demanded my money back
In one hour! Listen in! https://t.co/tkTGYVspa5 https://t.co/o0tkJfhu0z
Well, lots of us care, but no one IN POWER does anything about it. https://t.co/srSKxHuAyC
@HummBaby55 @SpiritAirlines Booked thru travel site. Zero warning. Didnt save money after checkin counter add-on fees. @SpiritAirlines
@17days @British_Airways @SpiritAirlines Agreed!
@17days @British_Airways @SpiritAirlines even WORSE. They should get their license revoked for fraudulent pricing
@jayrosen_nyu @ThisWeekABC “Even-handedness” goes out the window when the opposing side lies constantly. #BuckUp
@vespajet @SpiritAirlines Gotcha. But it ended up costing more than a real” airline would. @SpiritAirlines #BaitAndSwitch
Any of you guys flown @SpiritAirlines ? Ripoff fake “discount” airline. $110 extra to bring a small carryon. (My carryon only cost $30 to begin with) What was YOUR experience w #SpiritAirlines ? No bots please.
@SpiritAirlines Oh here we go with the fake customer support. #BaitAndSwitch @SpiritAirlines
TONIGHT ONLY! I’m on my way to LAX for this. Gonna be soooo funny/good. #PunkRockWarStories https://t.co/AF2hQ7boae
@SpiritAirlines Bait &amp; Switch: cheap ticket but $110 (RT) to carryon one small bag or $100 (RT) to check one small bag. So much for saving. #TheCustomerIsAMark #Beware #SpiritAir #SpiritAirlines

@Stonekettle Me too.
@mikeesfo1454 @SisterRoma @HOHmusical @sf_curran “She” is in Bay Area, but not the city anymore.
@StyggronKraal @agneimanis @TikiAmbassador @Kathy_Valentine @belindaofficial @officialschock @officialgogos This is my favorite line.
@GagaMonsoon @SisterRoma @HOHmusical @sf_curran I bought it in Tokyo. If it didn’t weigh ten pounds I’d wear it 24/7.
@SisterRoma @HOHmusical @sf_curran Love you, doll! Can’t wait for you to see the show. It’s SO GOOD!
I asked for a diagram, I got a diagram. Thank you, Twitter Gods. https://t.co/7oCNsa3yyZ
@nathanjones4 @velvetus1 It does help. Thank you.
@brianrayguitar Right? It’s not even funny.
@nathanjones4 Okaaaay. I hope you’re joking about the ripping and the raping.
@nathanjones4 I just dont understand what I’m looking at. It’s such a weird place not to have any hair. And where is all the long hair coming from? I’m so confused. I need a diagram.
It’s just...surreal. https://t.co/0ReXdURxNA
@TikiAmbassador @Kathy_Valentine @belindaofficial @officialschock @officialgogos Of course it is all 100% historically accurate... just like the Bible.

To be fair, I AM one of those atheists who makes fun of organized religion. But this: https://t.co/NQyQAQVUip
@GreatDismal Yeah, but will they take out the trash? #ManReplacer
@BillyESmith @JohnFugelsang Agreed.
@TroyLVale Judge not, lest you be judged.
@JohnFugelsang MJ being a plagiarist seems like the least of his character flaws.
Ha! https://t.co/ODo6How6Yr
