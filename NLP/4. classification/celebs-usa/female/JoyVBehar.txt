Keep your eyes on Nancy Pelosi during Trump's State of the Union tonight. It might be the first time in history that a Speaker of the House does a spit take.
@bevysmith @TheView @sunny @berniebehar. Vote for the cutest most adogable and that’s Bernie.
Highly recommend @iamcolinquinn's new show #RedStateBlueState. Or is it blue state red state? Who cares - just go see it at the Minetta Lane Theatre! @ColinQuinnShow_ https://t.co/7o5xkUNrR5
Some Republicans blamed Mitch McConnell for the shutdown. Clearly, they've forgotten all the times he's bent over backwards for them, which isn't easy to do without a spine.
@AnnCoulter Finally I agree with you. He’ll freezes over today. cheers
Trump should be delivering his State of the Union speech from the Kremlin.
Check out the book 'Hollywood's Eve' by Lili Anolik and find out what the world media is talking about. https://t.co/Ig0hqlVUDM
Can't wait for Trump's speech tonight. Instead of closed captioning they should have someone dressed as Pinocchio. Every time Trump tells a lie, their nose grows.
Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is right -- fossil fuels aren't the future. Neither are fossils like McConnell and Chuck Grassley.
She’s a hero for sure. @Malala https://t.co/GZUbkhzEAd
The Academy STILL hasn’t named an Oscars host? How about Louis C. K.? Just be sure to film him above the waist.
Everybody refers to Gen. Mattis as “the last grownup in the room.” Isn’t it time to contact child services as there is a toddler alone in the house?
@EricaJong Erica everyone marries their mother.
Can't wait to hear what Michael Cohen told the Feds. I’d rather hear HIM sing than Streisand at this point.
I see that Trump pardoned two turkeys at the White House. Pretty soon the turkeys will be pardoning HIM.
If Trump loves the idea of the WHCD replacing a comedian with a historian, wait until Ron Chernow starts comparing him to Alexander Hamilton.
Trump insulted a Navy SEAL over the hunt for Bin Laden when the CIA was actually in charge of that operation. Funny how those bone spurs never seem to prevent him from putting his foot in his mouth.
Lots of talk about Trump planning a big shakeup. Excuse me, but I think the shakeup already happened last Tuesday!
Is Matthew Whitaker unqualified? Which Trump appointee WAS qualified? Carson? DeVos? The event planner appointed to oversee federal housing?? I’m starting to think I have a shot at a cabinet job.
If the press corps really wants to antagonize Trump, they should start referring to themselves as the "press caravan."
Take heart, Jeff Sessions. Your long national nightmare is over. And hopefully, one day ours will be too.
Florida just elected TWO climate change deniers (Rick Scott, Ron DeSantis) even though the state is practically underwater!
Hurry up and concede, Scott Walker. My father, a proud union man, is waiting to celebrate in heaven.

Through much of the debate, Obama seemed distant, like he wasn't there. Almost Jim Lehrer-esque.
Obama looked like nobody had talked to him with that tone of voice in four years. You know, except for Michelle.
Romney nailed it. I wouldn’t be surprised if last night before going to bed he &amp; Ann celebrated w/ an extra glass of buttermilk.
Obama looked like he'd rather be back at the White House watching "Homeland." #SayAnything!

Is Romney afraid to appear on "The View"? C'mon, do the show, Mitt! We'll send a limo. It'll even have a roof rack for your dog.
Lindsay Lohan's been arrested again. I don't get it. Did she learn NOTHING from her 12 minutes in jail?
Romney said he’d have a better chance if he were Mexican. Yeah, but then his party would just deport him.
Romney claims he didn’t inherit anything from his rich father. Right. And Paul Ryan ran the marathon in under 3 hours.
I believe the first version of Mitt Romney’s leaked speech was delivered by Marie Antoinette.  #SayAnything

Rick Santorum said Akin is a good man who made a ridiculous statement. No, Gilbert Gottfried is a good man who makes ridiculous statements.
To Chris Matthews - Just saw you on Morning Joe yesterday, giving it to Reince Priebus - I just want you to know I love you!
Decision to postpone Republican Convention due to extreme weather only a theory, says GOP
Didn't Pat Robertson blame gays for the last hurricane? Hmmm...
Do you think Akin studied science the same place that Michelle Bachman studied history?
Romney calls Obama's campaign "nasty" and insists he's taking the high road. Romney's high road is where, exactly - the Cayman Islands?
In one month we’ve had new evidence of Amelia Earhart’s plane and the Loch Ness Monster but not Mitt Romney’s tax returns.

A new poll says that California is the most disliked state. What's not to love? Earthquakes, smog, traffic,  Chuck Norris...feel free to add
How to become a runaway: get homeschooled by Santorum
Santorum jumped the shark tonight. Loser.
It's over? Damn I just tuned in. It's the funniest show on TV. When's the next one.
Santorum is the misconception
The misconception about Newt is that he is, in fact, CHUCKIE!!!!
Gingrich is particularly scary when he laughs
The war against unions, the war against Iran, the war against women. What is going on?
Testing is not teaching.
The three stooges and Ron  Paul  as far as I can tell right now
Didn't Obama say that nothing's off the table with regards to Iran? Why do they lie?
Rick Santorum doesn't know what an adjective is.
"Truly faithful"is an oxymoron moving out of Chucky  Gingrich's mouth
At least Romney stays with a wife with a disease. Just saying'
Santorum is now totally irrelevant. At least Ron Paul is amusing even if he's living in the 19th century
How does she buy the insurance if she's got no job?
On Romney's planet, everyone will have perfectly coiffed hair.
Newt better watch  out. Ron Paul could jump on Calista
Now Chuckie G is attacking Wolfe. Too far.
Was English the official language of George Bush?
Nancy Pelosi says she knows something about Chuckie Gingrich. Hmmm. S & M? Cross Dressing? Bring it on, Nancy.
Mitch Daniels:talk about a negative nabob.
I don't need any Ambien tonight. I'm watching Mitch Daniels' rebuttal.  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
He will wipe the floor with either of those other two clowns!!!!??
The man is great tonight!
Some people will be paying off student loans with their social security checks
"Stop teaching for the test" amen
Fight obstruction with action. You go, Barry
Boehner doesn't clap for more jobs. Wtf?
Boehner got nicely tanned for tonight.
Gabby looks beautiful
Martin Bashir just ripped Rep. Walsh from Illinois a new one.
Downton Abbey demonstrates zero mobility of time period. Report:there is less upward mobility in US than England nowadays. Shocking.
Reporters and pundits keep asking Gingrich about his morals and family values. They need to get on him for hypocrisy.
Aha! So Bush had more on food stamps ( according to msnbc) than Obama. They lie!!!!!!
I shudder to think of the number of wars this guy (Newt) will get us into.
Why the contempt for New York, Newt? Isn't it where 9/11 happened?
I wonder if Jeb Bush is waiting for Newt and Mitt to implode so he can be the candidate?
Santorum should give his speech on marriage to his pal Newt
I love my Canadians. Didn't Mitt drive up there with a Dog on he roof?
Did Newt consult Planned Parenthood during his Open Marriage years?
Mitt could carry some illegals on top of his car and take them back to Canada
Doesn't Hollywood produce jobs? Newt can be in the next "Chuckie" movie
Mitt lived in the "real streets" of America?  Easy Street, more like it
Good thing I DVR'd this debate. Thanks for the update
Just got back from dinner. What did I miss? Did Newt talk about his "open marriage" on debates?
I'm enjoying the people power in Wisconsin.
I learned today that 47% of people on food stamps are children, 28 % are disabled or elderly. I wonder if Gingrich has ever missed a meal.
The crowd smells blood and licks it up
Gingrich is feeling his oats. Bring back the bell.
I wish Gingrich would come and clean my toilet
I'm wondering why I keep watching these debates. They keep repeating themselves.
Zero taxes? Who's going to police the streets, pick up garbage and put out fires?
Gingrich making no sense right now. Loser
Unemployment insurance saved my ass when I was a single mother.
Romney spews empty words. Platitudes. And the crowd goes wild.
They spend too much time attacking each other. Why don't they tell us how they plan to govern. It's always like a WWE smack down. #scdebate
The words "vulture capitalism" are now associated with Romney. Unfair to vultures? U decide scdebate#
Try to watch Andrew Sullivan, a Republican, on Chris Matthews tonight. Let's you know why we need to re elect Obama.
OK  My peeps have informed me the debates r on Fox @ 9. Get a glass of wine and watch another episode of Who Do You Trust aka The Gong Show
There's a debate tonight. Where????? It says it's streaming. That's over my head. Help
Rick S. Says it takes a family unless that family is gay.
I wonder if it bugs them that unemployment is creeping down under Obama.
This is rich. Didn't Chuckie G. Shut down the government?
Huntsman is finally going after Romney. They let Mitt slide last night but not after some caffeine this AM
Chucky  Gingrich is baaaaaack
The gloves are off
There's another debate. Get some coffee and watch
Perry is running on empty
Not the great vision question!
Last election Fred Thompson was in the debate. This election, he's in the reverse mortgage commercial. Who's next?
Perry never met a country he didn't want to re-invade. He's still pissed about the Alamo
Huntsman is now doing a pro Obama campaign commercial.
Why is a thrice married adulterer lecturing on the sanctity of marriage? Gingrich is the biggest hypocrite on this.
What's a penumbra? Does it need a contraceptive?
I have to say the Ron Paul Gingrich fight was exhilarating
Gobbledegook is delicious with fries
Riding in a car with @SusieEssman from Curb. She hasn't cursed at me once yet. But the day is young.
Santorum says contraception is license to "do things." Isn't  that the job of the Cialis, Levitra and Viagra?the holy trinity of pharmacies.
Here's wishing everyone a safe and happy new year.
HLN will be re-airing my interviews w/ @janemarielynch & @WilliamShatner 2nite at 10 ET. Watch while you still can.

Thanks. Let's hope. RT @larestaurantpr: @JoyVBehar you are gonna be missed!! hopefully some other network will be smart and snap you up!
Last week of new HLN shows. 2nite @margaretcho, religion panel & a look back at one of my favorite interviews from past 2 yrs w/ Rod Stewart
A $10,000 bet is nothing for Mitt Romney. He spends more than that on hair gel.
Lots of backlash after Lowe’s pulled their ads from a Muslim reality show. I hate it when people mix religion and lumber.
Confessing to @FrEdwardBeck for sins I committed on my @hlntv show. Got a caption for this photo? http://t.co/QAI52OKk
RT @lizzzybug: One of the most endearing things about your show is the laughter from the crew. They couldn't help but join in with the fun.
Prepping for my interview w/ @margaretcho. Show airs 2nite at 10 ET on @hlntv. Enjoy it while you still can.
RT @johnmgordon: Wanted to give your crew a big thanks for making it all look easy. You got lucky with them, Joy. I know you know it.
Thanks RT @puckstergirl: I can't bare to not see you & laugh with you every night! Please say someone is going to put you on their network
Bachman loves Cain and " pray the gay away" Marcus. What a loser
I'm loving Ron Paul. He know they're all idiots
You tweeters are funny tonight.
These people all want to back on food stamps and safety nets. I don't buy their sob stories
These stories are breaking my heart.
Santorum had two parents. That worked out well.
Newt, kiss Perry
Does Bachman know Bibi Netanyahu also?
Is it me or are the spouses scarier than the candidates?
Gingrich is praying they don't ask him this question
Camera on Mitt
Looking forward to the faith and family questions for Gingrich. Serial cheating should be at the top of the list.
These campaign speeches are boring the shit out of me
When Gingrich laughs, I get chills and not in a good way
Newt is calling Bachman a liar. Pot, meet kettle.
It's a gang bang on Chuckie Gingrich
Stephanopoulous asking hot questions
Uh oh. There goes Newt (Chuckie) Gingrich after Mitt.
Okay...favorite @Janefonda flim...and what is your favorite @themichaelcaine movie?

Virtues?  Like water boarding?
Huntsman is too smart for this crowd
Ron Paul is cool. Even if his clothes look like they just came out of the dryer
Does Bachman who took out Bin Laden. She's a joke
I see Herman Cain as torture
Newt is the change agent. Just ask his wives
I think we may be spared the dreaded 999 tonight. Keep fingers crossed
Didn't Romney say two minutes ago that he wouldn't give a timetable? Now he just said the opposite. The guy flip flops between questions
The audience is shocked that Huntsman doesn't want to drop bombs.
Dissing Bush?  Wow.
If it's covert, why is Newt announcing what he'd do?
Keep in mind that Cain didn't know that China has nukes since the sixties. Just sayin'

Don't they have the same housing bubble in Europe?
That curl on Mitt's forehead is turning me on. Move over, Elvis
Newt kisses up to anyone he thinks he can get the VP spot from..
The only thing that's flat is Rick Perry's brain waves
999 plan would hurt women the most. Duh
I wonder if nine nine nine more women will come out soon.
Does anyone understand a word Perry says?
Huntsman is the only one on the Republican side qualified to run for president. Maybe that's why he only has 1 pct. Of the vote.
Bravo to Maria Bartiromo for asking Cain the hard question.
On my @hlntv show @ 10: Herman Cain says he'll take lie detector test. I'll talk w/ @GloriaAllred. Do YOU think he's being honest?
Michelle Duggar is now expecting her 20th child. Please. There have been more people occupying this woman's uterus than Wall Street.

New poll picks Helen Mirren as sexiest woman in Hollywood. I can't wait to see her in AARP Magazine's swimsuit issue: http://bit.ly/oTNBk2
Spencer Pratt & Heidi Montag said "you can be too famous." They were once famous for being famous. Now they're famous for being annoying.
JLo: "I loved myself enough to walk away from marriage." She’s “loved herself enough” 3 times now. Any more self-loving & she’ll go blind.
Heidi Montag said she’s the “most hated girl ever.” How self-centered can one girl be?   Hasn’t she ever heard of Casey Anthony?
Helen Mirren named “Body of the Year” in a new poll. She’s 66 years old. Or as John McCain calls her, “jailbait.”
According to new poll, Helen Mirren has the best body in Hollywood. She was also named “Sexiest Helen,” beating out Helen Thomas.

Great foot rub courtesy of @ladygaga. Best one since Matthew McConaughey was here. Does that make me a "bi-ped?" http://twitpic.com/51lhe2
I hope this doesn’t break any of those patient/doctor confidentiality laws, but it is true: @ladygaga & I share the same gynecologist.
I love @ladygaga http://twitpic.com/51jgmk

HLN reairing my interviews w/ @ChazBono @donnyosmond @marieosmond now. So you have something to watch while packing for 2morrow's apocalypse
Perhaps tomorrow's Rapture really is going to happen. I just heard Oprah’s last guest is going to be God.  #May21
They’re saying the Rapture will occur Sat. at precisely 6 pm. I’m surprised a big event like that wasn’t scheduled for prime time.
San Francisco voters will now get to decide whether or not to ban circumcisions. How would YOU vote?  http://bitly.com/jx872J

Apparently, this Saturday marks the Day of Rapture and the start of Judgment Day. Got any fun plans for the weekend?  #May21 #Rapture
I love Jerry Lewis but I think it’s a good time for him to retire. Last year he introduced 6 different guests as Dean Martin.
Looking forward to talking w/ Debbie Reynolds on my @hlntv show tonight (10 pm ET).  Got a question for her?
This is certainly a bad week for the French. First the IMF scandal and now Jerry Lewis is stepping down from the telethon.
Dare to suggest a caption for this photo? My interview w/ @DonnyOsmond & @MarieOsmond airs 2nite at 10 pm on HLN  http://twitpic.com/4yyhkc

Whoever it was who had the foresight to trademark “The Sperminator” certainly has a lot of money coming his way today.
Really good show 2nite at 10 w/ @ChazBono @donlemoncnn & latest on @realDonaldTrump bowing out w/ @Omarosa @stephenasmith & @rachelsklar

No. We all get to work at the last minute.  RT @springvaca Do you meet in the am before the start of the show? #oprahlivetweet

Authorities found pot, herbal Viagra & Vaseline in Bin Laden's hideout. Was he in Abbottabad or a summer share on Fire Island?
Mötley Crüe's @NikkiSixx is on my HLN show 2nite. I Would have tweeted this earlier but it took me 2 hrs to figure out how to type an umlaut
Shooting of Jersey Shore in Italy has been delayed indefinitely. Snooki is really disappointed. She was dying to see the Eiffel Tower.
On my HLN set w/ Dick Van Dyke. Airs 2nite at 10. Very hard to believe he's 85 years old! http://twitpic.com/4vpb0j
They’ve postponed shooting Jersey Shore in Italy. I think authorities were afraid Snooki would try to hook up w/ the Statue of David.
Did you know there were actual lyrics to the The Dick Van Dyke Show theme? Here's Dick Van Dyke in my HLN green room: http://bit.ly/lu0Fei
Dick Van Dyke will be dropping by my HLN show tonight. Which reminds me—I should probably move away the ottoman.

Thanks so much for yesterday's Mother's Day wishes. And before I forget, a happy belated birthday to George Clooney, who turned 50 on Fri.

Obama's poll numbers are confusing. CBS says he's up 11 pts. Daily Beast says there's no jump. And Fox News says he dropped 127 pts.
On set w/ @MorganSpurlock. He made a film called "Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden?" Guess we know now. http://twitpic.com/4tewza
Bin Laden got shot like Moe Green and now he sleeps with the fishes. Are we sure it wasn’t Don Corleone who ordered the hit?
I’ll talk w/ @MorganSpurlock 2nite.He was in Super Size Me, which also happens to be name of the shop on 9th Ave where I buy my brassieres
They found both Coke & Pepsi in Osama’s compound. Impressive. The world’s worst terrorist & he still found the time to conduct a taste test.
I'll be talking w/ @MarloThomas on my HLN show 2nite at 10 ET. Got a question for That Girl?
A quote from my interview 2nite with @BillMaher: "I'd bet all my money Obama will be re-elected." Do you agree w/ Bill?
Separated at birth?  http://twitpic.com/4syan5
Apparently @WhoopiGoldberg is now on twitter. Who should she follow? Right now she's following no one, so this might be an uphill battle.
Congrats to Whoopi. Sister Act just received 5 Tony nominations! She'll be on my HLN show 2nite at 10pm to talk all about it. #TonyAwards
Betty White is coming on my HLN show. Got a question for her? Keep it clean.
Trump looked pissed at the Correspondents’ Dinner. I hope this doesn’t jeopardize Obama’s chance at hosting next year’s Miss USA Pageant.
Pease define the words many, thing & sexual RT @NikkiSixx I have heard many times @joyvbehar has a thing for me..maybe its sexual thing :)
Trump is now mad at Seth Meyers, Letterman, De Niro, and Seinfeld. The guy’s got a longer enemies list than Nixon.

Donald Trump's been making some really crazy statements. He better start listening to his media advisor: Meat Loaf.
On my @hlntv show 2nite I’ll talk w/ @kingsthings about the royal nuptials. I have a feeling he might know a few things about weddings.
Fergie was not invited to the #RoyalWedding. But there is a rumor she may crash with the Salahis.
Molly Ringwald is on my HLN show tonight at 10 pm ET. Got a question for her?
Next time Donald Trump gets in a taxi, he’d better pray Robert De Niro isn’t the driver.
Jim McGreevey’s ugly divorce is preventing him from becoming a priest. On the bright side, it frees him up to join the cast of Glee.

It’s just as well I wasn’t invited to the #royalwedding.With my luck I would’ve been stuck between the King of Swaziland & his 13 wives.
On my @hlntv show 2nite I'll talk w/ royal chef @DarrenMcGrady about #royalwedding. If you were catering this affair, what would you serve?
Lindsay Lohan was sentenced to 120 days in jail. On the bright side, prison will definitely help prepare Lohan for her role as a Gotti wife.

First Trump is mad at Rosie. Now he's after Jerry Seinfeld. What's he got against comedians? Carrot Top better watch his ass. I'm just sayin
Maybe Trump will finally stop carrying on about where Obama was born & get involved in the real issue: where was Obama Bar Mitzvahed?
I'll be taping my HLN Royal Wedding After Party in front of a live audience on 4/29. For tickets, email joybehartickets@gmail.com

NBC is cutting back on its royal wedding coverage. They say the couple is too boring. I know how to liven it up. Gary Busey. Best man.
Church is upset at  #Gaga about Judas. They said they had to make same exact protests when Madonna made the same exact video 25 yrs ago.

Apparently, nothing could have saved the cancelled ABC soaps. I heard they even tried redoing “All My Children” with the Octomom.
Why was Gary Busey booted off Apprentice? Perhaps Donald got tired of Busey’s crazy statements--like “I don’t think Obama was born here"
