@krissyzee Lmao I never bought a follower. I’m the type of person if you take my turn bowling I don’t wanna play anymore. I like a fair score. I’m honest and I like REAL wins
🙏🏼😘💖 RT @Love453Princess: @chanelwestcoast Love your new song!!!! I def can relate. 💋
I don’t care about social media clout, I’m trying to win Grammys and make enough money to take care of my whole family
@Gabxiellelauren Girl everyone loves my laugh people be hating on it to act cool or something. Rep your laugh to the fullest! Laughing keeps you alive longer! Lol #facts 🙌🏼💖

@ChadwickH86 AMEN lol 🙏🏼🙌🏼😘
Thank you luv! I’m happy I could impact your life in a positive way! 🙏🏼😘💖 RT @MarioRixx: @chanelwestcoast I will never regret the day I started supporting you. You made such a great impact in my life.
@attitudemilo Have you ever seen how many likes and RTs some of these other “artists” or “celebrities” get? Lol it’s clear a lot of my followers are slightly embarrassed to be my fan and support me otherwise they would like and RT much more like other people’s followers do
@DeezMaldo22 You must not follow me on Instagram because I spend every spare second I have liking nice comments and responding to as many fans as I can 🙏🏼💖
@Calikev2002 Nobody begging for shit I’m calling out all my followers who are scared little bitches to admit they fuck with me. You followed me right? So you must like me for something? Is there a reason to never RT me when I clearly could use support? You embarrassed  to be my fan? LOL
I make music. That’s what I’ve done my whole life. What I did before being on TV, what I’ll do after being on TV. It’s what I do in my spare time, what I do to deal with my emotions, and its what makes me happiest. SO if you don’t like my music or support it PLEASE unfollow me
@JimmyRude @robdyrdek Well I’m on TV because I was discovered by Rob Dyrdek AS A RAPPER lmao. Soooo keep being an ignorant tool. Go follow Rob and support him and unfollow me if you don’t like my music 🙏🏼🙌🏼✌🏼❤️
@robdcorley Thank you luv! Appreciate that. I feel I have a lot of “fans” embarrassed to be my fan and it’s really sad people think it’s not cool to like and support me. I’ve been the cool girl since elementary so it’s very confusing to me lol but thank god 4 real fans like you 🙏🏼🙌🏼😘💖
@attitudemilo You must not watch or pay attention to anything else I do other than my tweets lmao I’m the nicest, most kind hearted, and GIVING human being around. You think you know me because of a couple tweets complaining about terrible service from delivery apps? Lol OK. God bless you 🙏🏼
@Oakley1980 Then the rest should know I’m only on TV with Rob Dyrdek BECAUSE OF MY MUSIC! Lmaoooooo. If I never made music and had a MySpace music page I wouldn’t be on TV. My music is why I’m ANYTHING. My music is why I’m ALIVE. So if you don’t like it pleaseeeeeeeeeeee UNFOLLOW ME 🙏🏼🙌🏼
@johnnywapl2 Love you too! 😘💖
@steelbone27 Then go the fuck away lil bitch lol I got on TV because of my music, I did music my whole life, I was rapping/singing FAR BEFORE I was on tv. It’s my passion and what I will do even after I’m not tv anymore. So if you don’t support it GO AWAY!!!!! 🙏🏼❤️
@lysee_love Thanks for the heads up I’ll try to post more twitter original content lol 😁👍🏼
To the 800 thousand something people following me.....WHY the fuck are you following me if you don’t like or support anything I do? It’s a joke I get 100 RT’s yet people with 20k followers get 5k RT’s. Love my true fans but I have a lot of really shitty followers :-/
I could really use the support of my followers right now badly. Please RT my last tweet! 🙏🏼 Thank you to everyone for the support 😘❤️

Patience is a virtue. Have patience. Breathe. Stay clam. Everything will be ok eventually
I’ve come to the conclusion that nobody will ever be the perfect partner. In love, business, etc. We all fuck up. So I need to practice patience. Patience won’t make the other  person any better but it will make dealing with their slight imperfections that much easier
Looks like it’s #NYE in Vegas for the zillionth time lol

Those that supported you from day one are the ones you cherish. Beware of the last minute Larry’s trying to hop on the last cart on the train on the way to the top with you. Those are Caboosers. Stay away from them
Said it on insta and I’ll say it here again, people who jump on your train last minute are “Caboosers” &amp; that is the act of “Caboosing” hence a Caboose being the last cart on a train

If you are truly great at whatever it is you want to be great at, then god will let you shine when the time is right. Just have faith and stay persistent
Cockiness is believing in yourself SO much that you act rude to those who don’t see the same vision for you or think the same of you as you do yourself. No need to be rude to those that are too blind to see your greatness. Just be great and be kind
Confidence is believing in yourself and having a positive attitude even when you fail.
Keep your confidence to yourself. Nobody likes bragging and everyone is jealous of what they lack themselves. Cockiness also blocks blessings. So know the difference between confidence and cockiness....

Most people who say hateful things are just sad about their life. Those people need to realize we ALL got our own problems. Taking your inner pain out on others won’t make your problems go away
It seems like the people filled with the most hate are the ones to talk the most online. All the nice people are too busy living positive lives to be online talking shit. All you negative people need to get offline and go find a relationship with god 🙏🏼

@abrebel @415lisa_Lisa Don’t go around judging human beings by one minute clips you see of them. One minute of my life, you don’t even know the back story to, doesn’t define who I am ✌🏼
@abrebel @415lisa_Lisa If people tell me to ditch half my friends and only bring in the cute ones I’m not gunna accept that shit. That’s why I went off. Because I was told to not bring in certain friends. I ride for my friends. Rude shit was said to me first. Did you see that? No. You saw a reaction
@abrebel @415lisa_Lisa Geez just responded to another asshole about the same thing. I don’t go around yelling at people for not treating me like a superstar lmao. I’m the chilliest most humble down to earth celebrity you could ever be lucky enough to meet. I defend my friends. Big difference....
@Sammyhayes1964 Lol people like you blow my mind. You think I go down the street yelling shit at doormen? Or do you think something was said to me first to provoke me to react??? Hmm.lets think about this 🤔
@JaymzB1 @415lisa_Lisa Thanks luv appreciate that 🙏🏼😘💖
Some people are just really sad in their lives and the way they make themselves feel better is by saying mean things about others. Don’t let the mean things they say affect you. Instead try to help those sad people be happy

No amount of money or fame motivates me to make music. I’m motivated to make music from my heart. My daily struggle in life, my love life, my family, my dog, everything around me inspires me to make music 🎶
I will never stop making music. No matter where it takes me in my career I will always make music because it’s my hobby, my passion, and what I LOVE to do

2018 is the year for everyone to step it up. Wether it’s your career, your health, your friendships, or romantic relationships you are focused on, no matter what it is, try harder, do more, make no excuses...just STEP IT UP
The only way to win is to surround yourself with other winners
In 2018 I’m only surrounding myself with positive, supportive, motivated humans.

@hseigworth you realize you don’t know me right? You realize ridiculousness isn’t about my life right? How does me being on ridiculousness not make me a real artist?Please do explain 🙏🏼

Cutting highly superficial fake people out of your life is good for your health. Don’t have people like that around they drain your soul

LMAO the highlight of the video of me on @TMZ is my bestie @lovableroxy in the background saying “I just want food” 😂😂😂

And news flash I didn’t get denied @TMZ. Lol I never get denied in any club. They denied letting my friends in. Tried to tell me to come in with only one of them. I don’t ditch my friends why don’t you report that 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

@Cactus_Jacker lol 🙌🏼❤️
@Sammmilyn stfu and read my tweets and stop being a dumb ass believing every picture the media tries to paint
The media never shows what a hardworking, kind person I am but as soon as they can catch me drunk going off they show it. Drunk after I slayed my show performing at the @peppermintclub mind you. Drunk celebrating a dope performance. Not just drunk for nothing on a Monday lol
Don’t let any snippets of me acting mad and drunk define who I am. Editing is quite the magic trick lol at the end of the day I stand up for my friends and refuse to let anyone feel left out. I’m a good friend. So think what you want of me but my friends know what’s up
I’m not a superficial bitch who does anything to get in a club. Like some of these desperate lames. Wont ditch my friends at the door to enter anywhere. I like to go out with my FRIENDS. Hopefully the girls that looked 12 that got in the club had real ID lol
Fuck LA and fuck clubs period. Honestly. They tried to tell me ya we can let you and on other person in lol am I supposed to just ditch my friends? 😂 sorry I’m not fake i won’t ditch my friends for any club ✌🏼
@evolvedvictor lol you obviously haven’t seen me live or heard more than 2 of my songs. But it’s ok keep hatin on me thinking you sound cool for it 👍🏼

@robinobryant13 people spend time on the wrong shit. They need to spend  their time &amp; energy on things that will actually make a difference: Meek fine lol. He violated probation, he got a fucked up sentence, &amp; it will get shortened. This girl needs far more support than Meek
@robinobryant13 not calling out Meek. Calling out the idiots who spent time in the streets chanting free Meek Mill when they should’ve spent time on more important issues
Always a good time on stage with my girls 😁💖🎤🎵 https://t.co/6AiSvSpxrC
@robinobryant13 and PS I high key fuck with Meek Mill. Yes his sentencing was out of line and uncalled for but he don’t deserve mobs of people chanting for his release over this girl. My point is... we as humans should focus energy on what REALLY matters 🙏🏼
@robinobryant13 and as a fellow woman the fact you don’t get what I’m saying shows what is wrong with this world. You busy defending meek mill trying to diss me instead of getting the damn point. Lol wake up girl
@robinobryant13 A bunch of fools on the street chanting free meek mill who violated his probation, and this girl was kidnapped, sex slaved, then convicted of murdering the person who enslaved her. Maybe people should be chanting for her release instead? 🤔🤔🤔
Sometimes even the people who say they believe in you and support you don’t genuinely do. Believe in YOURSELF. That’s all that matters
Love my girls ❤️ https://t.co/22IvWKWMZp
@KabachiSlim like how you gunna say I’m lame as hell for that? You a rapist too or something? Cuz after reading about what happened to that little girl and calling me lame for my comment you sound like a real sexist pig

@KabachiSlim no people are lame as hell spending so much damn time worrying about freeing Meek Mill who gunna end up out soon anyways cuz they gave him a foul sentence. People should be out chanting to free this little girl! People focus on the wrong shit too much :-/

People who don’t believe in global warming crack me up. When I was a kid growing up in the valley in LA our hottest summer day was 100 degrees. This past summer it was over 100 almost every day, some days reaching up to 115 degrees. Ya global warming isn’t real at all 😂 WAKE UP

It’s how you react to the shitty things that happen in life that determine your life’s quality. Learn to laugh things off and let go
As a Virgo I’m a perfectionist and tend to over plan everything.....but I’m slowly but surely learning NOTHING is ever perfect.
So instead of stressing about what could’ve or should’ve happened or how fast time is going....I’m just going with the flow for once
I’ve learned that stressing over set backs and failures only creates negative energy further setting you back....
For 14 years I have been working my ass off towards my goals &amp; dreams. I always stress out when I don’t succeed at something right away....

I'm so sick of @Uber_LA and the psycho drivers they hire. I took a 5 minute drive home and woke up to a $400 charge 😂 #GiveMeBackMyMoney
It trips me out how people assume they know my life and how I was raised lol did I grow up on a reality show I'm unaware of?? 😂😂😂
To those out there with negative people or situations in your life, just know you are not alone &amp; I feel your pain. Keep your head up
I don't know why people love to spread negativity so much but I truly feel bad for those people and I pray for your souls 🙏🏼
Everyone is entitled to their opinions. There are ways of saying things without being extremely fucking rude though.
Trump is an idiot. Racists are idiots. Haters are idiots. Let's all unite as one and spread LOVE!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️ #TakeAKnee

Focus on the road ahead and treat these haters like speed bumps. Roll right over them bitches and keep it pushing 💃🏼
If you have a passion for something don't let anyone discourage you with mean words. Most people saying mean stuff are just sad
Even if I didn't make a dime off music I would still make it because it has always been my hobby, my passion, my LIFE. It's what I DO
When I started dancing and singing as a kid I did it because I loved music. Not for money, or to impress anyone. I just loved music...
It's funny how haters think their nasty comments will stop me from doing music.... something I have done my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE

@EJ_Hardin https://t.co/klSNXEIKAl
When you have a passion for something, you gotta stand up for it, live for it, and be willing to die for it. Thats how I am with my music
Thank you to @cthagod! Even tho a slew of trolls are hating on me now a lot of people know I do music who didn't and that's all I care about
@EJ_Hardin no babe. His opinion don't matter. Unless he can read sheet music like I can he ain't a musician and his opinion ain't valid lol
🙏🏼🙌🏼😘❤️ RT @K1ng_D1ngaling: @chanelwestcoast I like "been on" "I love money" and "tinted windows" :)
@Talayuh https://t.co/klSNXEIKAl
@STP_PheNoM none had a boyfriend for years lol I probably would be much farther if I was a hoe tho 😂😂😂😂
@cee_adams love you too 😘❤️🙌🏼
@thelittleladyyy you can ignore my truth and make up your own but the facts are the facts
@thelittleladyyy the proof is in my work. Got songs w/ hella dope artists. I didn't pay any of them. They hopped on songs w/ me cuz I'm dope
@thelittleladyyy lol only haters would say my musical track record don't mean shit 😂😂😂
@Talayuh ridiculousness is my day job. My passion ain't laughing on couches my passion is music lol
@Talayuh I've been an artist my whole life. I got on tv by being an artist lol. Never done anything besides music, &amp; dance since I was a kid
@zekNcashe Just cuz I'm nice and happy don't mean I'm one to fuck with. There is a reason I'm a rapper....it's cuz I'm a bold ass bitch
@fridahalo my step mother, who happens to be black, loves my music and can relate to a bunch of my songs so maybe it's just you ✌🏼
#Chillin
Thank god for this beautiful Cali weed and weather. Bout to hit the pool and work on my tan while smoking some of the finest 😜👌🏼
@MaryFuckedJane maybe you should take some time to get familiar with my music first cuz I don't think you are ✌🏼 https://t.co/klSNXEIKAl
@MaryFuckedJane i got so many songs about shitty relationships that women can relate to &amp; I try to speak for US &amp; here you are hating on me
@MaryFuckedJane and you are another woman that makes women stay below men. Unite with your fellow women. Stick together
@_Sly_Sky_ no babe never paid anything I love that you are literally ignoring my truth and making up your own. Way to never give up 🙌🏼😂
@_Sly_Sky_ I'm actually just dope and dumb ass people can't seem to fathom that their favorite artists fuck with me and I'm a legit artist
@_Sly_Sky_ some of the biggest artists fuck with me! People get on songs with me cuz they know I'm dope and coming up in the game!!
@_Sly_Sky_ LOL I'm literally laughing non stop at comments like this. I have NEVER PAID for ANY feature!!! People fuck with me!!
@tyfranklinjr I got mad cuz he's making comments with no credibility. I got a decent rap resume that's why I had to hit him with the facts
"They wanna see ya fall like a domino, but I'm a keep it tight like a panty ho" #Countin
I got collabs w/ some of the biggest artists. No regular joe opinion matter more than a Snoop &amp; Wayne opinion lol #MyCoSignsLit
@gabbagabb_ because most people like you hating haven't even heard one song of mine when I got A LOT of fire with huge collabs
@gabbagabb_ promise once you take the time to LISTEN to my music you will feel bad for hating. Every hater I push to listen comes back a fan
@gabbagabb_ you wasting more time hating with blind eyes. Try without you, punch drunk love, greatest hit, etc. girls like those ones ✌🏼
@RatedPaulG I have a whole entire career y'all sitting here hating acting like it dont exist lol get familiar https://t.co/iBepNJRPqa
@RatedPaulG got songs with snoop, french, YG, Etc. won a BET award with young money, opened for Wayne, Rick Ross etc. lol
@RatedPaulG I'm only on a tv show around the world with millions of plays on my music and 2 cross country tours under my belt. No biggie
@gabbagabb_ I got so much fire and so many big artists collab with me like how do regular joes think they opinion more valid than Wayne? 😂
@gabbagabb_ and what one song was that??? Lol all you liars haven't even heard half my shit 😂 https://t.co/klSNXEIKAl
@CobainGees LOL
@djalexroy yo he didn't call me out lmao he stated an opinion that is not valid. Anyone with a brain knows I make dope music lol
Dying laughing at people calling me privileged and talking about my "privileged life." I grew up broke w/ a single mom dumb fucks 😂😂😂😂
@Jon155MMA how I get dragged? Lol he got dragged with the facts ain't nobody drag my ass. I got more followers and song plays now 😂😂😂😂😂
@JohnnyBlaze_82 @LunaticOmega LMAO where do you get the idea I come from a privileged background? Grew up broke w/ a single mom homie 😂😂😂

And team private jet even tho I'm not taking those as often ✊🏼😂😂😂
Team Southwest &amp; Virgin &amp; Jet Blue &amp; basically any airline except United ✊🏼😂
Everybody should stay away from @united airlines. They suck. Worst airline there is by far. Just watch what they did to that innocent man...
I absolutely despise @united airlines. Always get stuff stolen from my luggage, delayed flights, rude flight attendants, etc......
I am so outraged by seeing that poor man dragged off of a @united airlines flight! That man should be paid A LOT of money!!!!!!
@UncleTrizzy LOL babe I was rapping long before I was on tv nobody taught me I taught myself 😂 but thanks! 🙌🏼

Hard work always pays off. Stay focused, stay humble, stay passionate, and your dreams will come true no matter what ✨
To those of you who got a lot of people doubting you...I feel you and I wanna encourage you to ignore them and keep following your dreams!

Just when they think you about to fall off is when you actually catch em all by surprise
Plus getting mad and frowning causes more wrinkles than smiling does. So I prefer to laugh shit off rather than get angry bout it lol
I used to get mad SO easily then after so many things in my life went wrong I realized it's not worth the energy to get mad.....
@JWWongTN ya at zero seconds left! Lol
Low key I wanna try a new escape room every weekend now it was so fun lol
I never updated you guys on the escape room situation. It wasn't scary at all. It's like a puzzle you gotta figure out to escape. Hella fun!
