3/4 While at @GUEnergyLabs HQ, I got to do a blind taste test of their latest top-secret flavor.  My response? ‚Äúit tastes like cake!‚Äù and it really does‚Ä¶.I admit, I sometimes eat it for desert because it‚Äôs that good.  #GUturns25 #guforit¬†#eatingistraining

Key to my own evolution, growth &amp; relevance in career and life:  keep asking: who am I, what do I have to offer, where do I want to go, how to get there &amp; MOST importantly WHY am I doing it? Per @simonsinek ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what u do, it‚Äôs why u do it‚Äù https://t.co/v8stny4qXN

3/3 ‚Ä¶@jessdiggs + @kikkanimal proved it takes more than $$ to be champions. They just changed US history + inspired athletes everywhere who are taking the hard road to gold. Thx @outsidemagazine for the great article &amp; @NBCSports for full replays.
2/3 What also shone thru was the teamwork of veteran @kikkanimal who's paved the way for so many females like @jessdiggs, all positive energy even at the start line.  They both dedicated themselves to this underfunded US sport‚Ä¶.
1/3 best race of the #Olympics US women‚Äôs team sprint gold medalists @kikkanimal &amp; @jessdiggs - their race made me cry: pure grit &amp; determination in  the hardest sport on the planet shone through.  https://t.co/lUj49sYh37

3/4 Me? I‚Äôm a rider and adventurer; not just a podium-chaser. @NinerBikes allowed me to evolve my career. The multi-year contract they sent closed w: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be an asshole.‚Äù That cinched it b/c their culture/values matched mine as an athlete and I still feel that way today. https://t.co/VPZGDNxezh
2/4  I took a calculated risk  w/@NinerBikes; people I didn‚Äôt know. However: #niner 1) has a cult following of #Ninerds, 2) my trusted bike mechanic / shop owner Jason Bauer loves their bikes/can‚Äôt keep em in stock &amp; 3) co. motto feat. words ‚Äúpeople‚Äù and ‚Äúpassion.‚Äù https://t.co/DGpwvrl7sD
1/4 BIG NEWS! When I switched to @NinerBikes in 2014, I was just about to head into the most important &amp; biggest expedition of my life;  my ride down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to find my father. #Niner took a big risk by investing in this journey w/me. https://t.co/kqjfmxEO8K
