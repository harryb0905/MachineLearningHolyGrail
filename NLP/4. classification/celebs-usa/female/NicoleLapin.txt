Just like your clothing tastes changes over time, so will your financial demands. That “one size” that fits you right now may not be the right size down the road. Continue to “size yourself up.” Your $$ will continue to grow and evolve, and so should your thinking (&amp; rethinking).

If you’re not making money in the first year of your business, you need to move on. A business is not a charity. You need to make money. Having a passion project is not a business, that’s not a career. Having a hobby is not having a job. #BossBitch #RichBitch

Set up automatic deposits by either getting your employer to do a payroll deduction, or have your money automatically moved from your checking account to your IRA. If that money is going into your retirement account automatically, there’s less risk that you’ll spend it.

Analyze your tracking at the end of each week. As you begin to notice trends in your spending, you can relocate funds. For example, saving on transportation since you started biking to work? Throw some of those savings into your housing budget, or better yet, your savings!
Like #avocados are “good fat,” which nourishes your body, #studentloans are “good debt,” which expands your knowledge and (hopefully) furthers your career. But like avocados are still fat, student loans are still debt…so don’t gorge on them! #BossBitch  https://t.co/uY9JPC2eT9
A #salary bump is the most typical method of #raise, but there are lots of other ways to reward your performance, and some might be even more valuable to your current financial and personal situation. Think healthcare, stock options, or 1 day a week working from home. #BossBitch

Even if you’re #frugal with your #money in #retirement, you should still expect your #expenses to be at least 60% of what they are now–and most people should probably aim to have enough savings to cover 80% of what they currently spend.  #RichBitch  https://t.co/MBiR87F9ft
Have you heard the big news?  https://t.co/FWZrlRuKlf
It’s super important to figure out the road map for your life and how to get there. Have one, three, five, seven and ten year goals. Don't limit them to your career: you need to plan where you’re going in all aspects of life. Make sure those goals are compatible. #BossBitch

Take a look at your budget and see if you have any surplus funds that could be reallocated into savings. No longer driving to work? Done away with a costly monthly gym membership? Got a cash gift or bonus? Put that extra cash into savings. #BossBitch #RichBitch
Look at your monthly payments like gym membership, TV streaming membership, etc. Cancel any you’re not using or look for cheaper alternatives. Give yourself this audit not just at the beginning of the year, but at the start of each quarter as well! #BossBitch #RichBitch

Buying stuff you don’t need because you think it’s a good deal, is worse for your budget than a tub of peanut butter is for your waistline!
Tackling debt?  “Prioritize to pulverize.” Repeat after me: not all debt is created equal. Pay off credit cards before ANY other debt.
You are your own business. If you don’t take care of yourself and treat your life like a business, you won’t be good at any other kind.

Hiring managers often only spend about 20 seconds glancing over a resumé. You’ve gotta make that time count, and a clean layout is key!
Investing isn’t all about complicated numbers, it’s about you and me as consumers; consumers drive sales and thus profits and thus stocks.

@_morganreiley @colehorrockz_ @MONEY now, now... 😘💰 #MoneyIdol
@animangia whatever visual works best for you! #MoneyIdol
@DLFreedman (2/2) relationships + interactions it becomes easier to talk about/makes more sense. #MoneyIdol
@DLFreedman yes+I agree w/Kate wholeheartedly—money is cultural. If you start framing your mindset around how if affects (1/2) #MoneyIdol
@robertonoram tell them you're going to competitor!
A8: A financial diet is like a regular diet. Allow yourself small indulgences &amp; keep your eye on the bigger picture. #MoneyIdol
A8: Stop using the word "budget"+ start using "spending plan; something sustainable like an "eating plan" vs "diet." #MoneyIdol
@robertonoram sure thing!!
A7: And whatever you ask for, the point is to know your worth and to make work work for you. #MoneyIdol
A7: Timing is everything! Have a set number in mind. The idea isn’t to get a raise to her by, but to have a little extra to save! #MoneyIdol
@KyleWAlpha yes slow + steady wins the race in this case. A manageable payment amount in the long-term is the way to go. #MoneyIdol
@robertonoram and sometimes yes, you’ll get hit with no, but you’ll never know until you ask &amp; there’s nothing to lose. #MoneyIdol
@robertonoram see about qualifying for a hardship plan.Creditors have an incentive for you to pay the debt back, try + try again. #Moneyidol
A6: Have a realistic timetable to pay it off, but don’t set comfy deadlines. Paying debt off isn’t a comfy thing. #MoneyIdol
A6: Schedule your debt payments to automatically come out of your paycheck each month before you spend it elsewhere. #MoneyIdol
A6: Call your CC company and ask for a lower APR. Negotiate everything! #MoneyIdol
A6: Make a timetable to pay off your debt and don’t drag it out; 'cause the longer you do, you're paying more interest. #MoneyIdol
A6: Pay down the debt w/highest interest rate first, which is usually your credit card. Prioritize to pulverize! #MoneyIdol
A5: Remember, it's about little (planned for) indulgences here and there to avoid the big binge. Just like a diet. #MoneyIdol
@veryFatcat hahaha well... #MoneyIdol
@Reiko444 keep up the financial empowerment!!😘
A5: It's not just about the $, it's about the empowerment that comes w/taking control of your financial destiny. You deserve it. #MoneyIdol
A5: Quit thinking of "future you" as a different person than "current you." Remind yourself WHY you're budgeting and saving. #MoneyIdol
A4: "Why Investing Isn’t That Scary (and Everything You Need to Know to Get Started, Already!)" https://t.co/mlqjcb3Sh3 #MoneyIdol
@trinityizreal yes!!
@Reiko444 thanks girl! &amp; you can listen to it now too!
@hull_j it’s so much better to fine “therapy” in something else topics to do: reading, crafting, running, whatever. #MoneyIdol
A4: So to keep it short + sweet: Don't. Be. Scared. #MoneyIdol
A4:If you're risk averse you're getting not just zilch in a bank account you're losing purchasing power b/c inflation grows at 3%!#MoneyIdol
@Reiko444 #getitgirl!!!
@dhess36 aw thx! #MoneyIdol
A3: Spending $$ emotionally. People joke about retail therapy, but it’s really just a euphemism for overspending! #MoneyIdol
A3: Not prioritizing paying off debt and saving for retirement. Not sticking to a spending plan, and not paying on time. #MoneyIdol
@SharonNCRITM always happy to help 😊 #MoneyIdol
@johnrampton yes, get everyone to sit down and really take a look at where the $ is going! #MoneyIdol
A2: &amp; Don't be a follower if the market tanks. Remember that's when things are on sale! Buy low, sell high. Duh. #MoneyIdol
A2: Don't freak out w/all uncertainty next year--election year, interest rates, etc.Stay focused+unfazed by the inevitable chaos.#MoneyIdol
@itsbecslife #werkit 👊🏻💰
@trinityizreal haha you could do both 😉 Happy to help!! #moneyidol
@DLFreedman yes! Should always have 6-9 months in the bank as an emergency fund. #MoneyIdol
@itsbecslife yeah! You never know if you don’t ask and nothing to lose... #MoneyIdol
A1: Also, do a yearly housekeeping call to all of your major bill-generators and see if there might be a better deal available. #MoneyIdol
A1: Take a financial selfie to see where your $ is really going so you can tweak your spending plan for success in 2016! #MoneyIdol
