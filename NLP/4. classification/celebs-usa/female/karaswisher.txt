@jamechristie @sammartino Yeah
@Marketeer2u I don‚Äôt delete tweets if possible or at least need to leave up the tweet so I can also show the progression
@brian @SenFeinstein Fair point but still
@Son0fCush She should have been less tough with the kids
@PeterRo24971045 @profgalloway I have not supported it though I am certainly up for a tough debate  on it
@EdAlvarezB So they say
@alexscholl13 Yep
@lee_frey Indeed
@gfupticks Good points
@ddssff @MillerEM This is exactly right
@parthiv645 @Recode Actually there are lots of debate on it
@TommyIgoe @SenFeinstein Me too (let‚Äôs be clear the videos of me would not be so nice)

@jaydedapper Sorry still think it‚Äôs a bad look to chastise kids in public. No one looks good at that, even if it is just politics
@tnabielec Sometimes!
@Jimmyspolitics @SenFeinstein Fair points all. Though this is politics and she should probably know all about how this kind of tactic works.
Those tweeting about the whole video make a fair point about seeing whole encounter. It‚Äôs better, but I still don‚Äôt love the tone overall. But also still entirely fair point about the cherry picking edit.

It must be said: My crazy dogs walk in a more organized way than that Twitter convo with @jack went last night. That said, Jack was better behaved (really he does deserve a üëèüèº for attempting it). Here is a tidier version: https://t.co/l41iQbed3A https://t.co/7AMbjwyWnx

@danmccrory6 @ewlamy @GreekFire23 Again you DOPE: I did not ask for @jack to ban him. I asked if they would if he was not president and therefore not ‚Äúnewsworthy‚Äù which is Twitter‚Äôs rule not mine. Do you ever do your homework or were you that obnoxious kid who always wrong but never in doubt. Ok we done.

@danmccrory6 @ewlamy @GreekFire23 3rd time a dope! At least you are good at something, even if it is lazy and boneheaded tweeting. I crossed 1 million followers long ago, back to when Trump was a washed up reality show star. Want to try for 4 or maybe try harder to actually have knowledge before mouthing off
@ewlamy @danmccrory6 @GreekFire23 What he said
@danmccrory6 @GreekFire23 Um that is my hobby. Dope again! Try for three but I would suggest actually knowing who you were trying to insult first.

This is so much better https://t.co/tNDvQu3R3Z
@jack Neither does my kid. He just wants to go get dinner #KaraJack
@jack @RMac18 @finkd @waltmossberg Don't yell at Ryan!
@60SecondLunch um https://t.co/g2BWBHPMpR
@jack My kid is hungry and says that you should do a real interview with me even if I am mean. Just saying. #karajack
@jack Make a glass house for events and people can watch and not throw stones. Pro tip: Twitter convos are wack. #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC Speaking of that (CONVERSATION), let's do one with sounds soon, like this #KaraJack #likebutter https://t.co/GJyHDWWKxY
LAST Q: For the love of God, please do Recode Decode podcast with me soon, because analog talking seems to be a better way of asking questions and giving answers. I think Twitter agrees and this has shown how hard this thread is to do. That said, thx for trying. Really. #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC By what? What is the #1 thing that distracted you and others and made this obvious mess via social media? #KaraJack
@jack Why are you still saying you‚Äôre the CEO of two publicly traded companies? What‚Äôs the point in insisting you can do two jobs that both require maximum effort at the same time? #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC Also are you ever going to hire someone to effectively be your number 2? #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC Ok, last ones are about you and we need to go long because your system here it confusing says the people of Twitter:   1. What has been Twitter‚Äôs biggest missed opportunity since you came back as CEO?   #karajack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC She is well beyond mastering it. She speaks fluent Twitter. #KaraJack
@jack Clip clop! #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk What about @AOC #KaraJack
@jack And what about making Twitter a public trust?
@jack Chop chop on the other answers! I have more questions! If you want to use this method, quicker! #karajack
@shellen Yes.
@jack Ok, then WHO is the most exciting influential on Twitter right now? BE SPECIFIC #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump I still am dying for specifics here. #KaraJack https://t.co/Z8j8oGYeHg
@jack @realDonaldTrump Also: How close were you to selling Twitter in 2016? What happened?   What about giving the company to a public trust per your NYT discussion.  #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump also: Is twitter still considering a subscription service? Like ‚ÄúTwitter Premium‚Äù or something? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump going to shift to biz questions since it is not a lot of time and this system is CHAOTIC (as I thought it would be): What about the move to DAU instead of MAU. Why the move? And how are we to interpret the much smaller numbers? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump it would be really great to get specific examples as a lot of what you are doing appears incomprehensible to many. #karajack
@ccantu941 yes
@jack @realDonaldTrump Can you give a more detailed example of that that worked? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump Not one name? Ok, but it is a copout imho. I have a long list. #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump What confidence should we have that Russia or other state-sponsored actors won‚Äôt be able to wreak havoc on next year‚Äôs elections? #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump Ok new question (answer the newsworthy historical figure you MIGHT ban pls):  Single biggest improvement at Twitter since 2016 that signals you‚Äôre ready for the 2020 elections? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump That seems questionable to a lot of people. Let me try it a different way: What historic newsworthy figure would you ban? Is someone bad enough to ban. Be specific. A name. #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump And will Twitter‚Äôs business/engagement suffer when @realDonaldTrump is no longer President? #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump Have you ever considered suspending Donald Trump? His tweets are somewhat protected because he‚Äôs a public figure, but would he have been suspended in the past if he were a ‚Äúregular‚Äù user? #karajack
@jack Speaking of outrage, see my @realDonaldTrump question #karajack
@jack But you invented it. You can control it. Slowness is not really a good excuse. #karajack
Ok trying AGAIN @jack in another new thread! This one about @realDonaldTrump #KaraJack:   We know a lot more about what Donald Trump thinks because of Twitter, and we all have mixed feelings about that.
@jack But why do they feel that way? You made it. #KaraJack
Hey @jack please reply to the new thread! Are you off eating bad meat with @finkd? #KaraJack
@jack In that vein, how does it affect YOU? #KaraJack
Ok, new one @jack #KaraJack  What do you think about twitter breaks and purges. Why do you think that is? I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve heard many people say they feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù after not being on twitter for a while:  https://t.co/RbucMeOSkE
@jack @finkd @waltmossberg Yeah, it's Chinatown, Jake. #KaraJack
@jack @finkd I am going to start a NEW thread to make it easy for people to follow (@waltmossberg just texted me that it is a "chaotic hellpit"). Stay in that one. OK? #KaraJack
@jack @finkd No, he is busy fixing Facebook. NOT! (he makes you look good) #karajack
@jack @finkd I wanted to get off thread with Mark added! Like he needs more of me. #KaraJack
@jack @finkd https://t.co/l6hAVMtrtB
@jack @finkd thx. I meant even more specifics on 4. But see the Twitter purge one. #KaraJack
@DevonHeinen Not my choice! Peace out!
@jack Ok, I am moving on to a related area: What do you think about twitter breaks and purges. Why do you think that is? I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve heard many people say they feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù after not being on twitter for a while. Such as this: https://t.co/RbucMeOSkE
@jack @finkd 1. WHICH?  2. HOW? 3. OK, MUTE BUT THAT WAS A WHILE AGO 4. WHAT MORE? I think people are dying for specifics. #karajack
@felixsalmon I love you #karajack
@jack Yes but i want THREE concrete examples.
@jack @finkd And so to end this topic, I will try again. Please give me three concrete things you have done to fix this. SPECIFIC. #karajack
@jack Got it. But do you think the fact that you all could not conceive of what it is to feel unsafe (women, POC, LGBTQ, other marginalized people) could be one of the issues? (new topic soon) #karajack
@jack @finkd I grade you all an F on this and that's being kind. I'm not trying to be a jackass, but it's been a very slow roll by all of you in tech to pay attention to this. Why do you think that is? I think it is because many of the people who made Twitter never ever felt unsafe. #karajack
@jack But why did you NOT see it? It seems pretty basic to run your platform with some semblance of paying mind to what people are doing on it? Can you give me some insight into why that was not done? #KaraJack
@jack So you do see the link between what you do and real life danger to people? Can you say that explicitly? I could not be @finkd to even address the fact that he made something that resulted in real tragedy. #KaraJack
@jack Why not just be more stringent on kicking off offenders? It seems like you tolerate a lot. If Twitter ran my house, my kids would be eating ramen, playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and wearing filthy socks #karajack
@jack So how do you stop THAT? I mean regular police forces cannot stop that. It seems your job is not to let it get that far in the first place. #KaraJack
@jack I am still confused. What the heck is "off-platform ramifications"? You are not going to have a police force, right? Are you 911? #karajack
@jack Well, WHERE does abuse happen most #karajack
@jack When you say physical safety, I am confused. What do you mean specifically? You are not a police force. In fact, social media companies have built cities without police, fire departments, garbage pickup or street signs. IMHO What do you think of that metaphor? #KaraJack
@jack Or maybe, tell me what you think the illness is you are treating? I think you cannot solve a disease without knowing that. Or did you create the virus? #karajack
@RichBTIG @jack ALL F
@jack Ok name three initiatives. #karajack
@jack Ok but I really want to drill down on HOW. How much downside are you willing to tolerate to balance the good that Twitter can provide? Be specific. #KaraJack
@jack please be specific. I see a lot of beard-stroking on this (no insult to your Lincoln jam, but it works). WHAT are you changing? SPECIFICALLY. #KaraJack
@jack Also my son gets a C in coding and that is NO tragedy. You getting one matters a lot. #karajack
@jack Well that is like telling me I am sick and am responsible for fixing it. YOU made the product, YOU run the platform. Saying it is a huge fail is a cop out to many. It is to me #karajack
@jack It seems twitter has been stuck in a stagnant phase of considering/thinking about the health of the conversation, which plays into safety, for about 18-24 months. How have you made actual progress? Can you point me to it SPECIFICALLY?
You know my jam these days is tech responsibility. What grade do you gave Silicon Valley? Yourself? #KaraJack
@jack Well an event product WOULD BE NICE. See my why aren't you moving faster trope.
Overall here is my mood and I think a lot of people when it comes to fixing what is broke about social media and tech: Why aren‚Äôt you moving faster? Why aren‚Äôt you moving faster? Why aren‚Äôt you moving faster? #KaraJack
@jack Great, let's go #KaraJack
To be clear with audience, there is not a new event product, a glass house, if you will, where people can see us but not comment. I will ask questions and then respond to @jack answers. So it could be CHAOS. #KaraJack
As @ashleyfeinberg wrote: ‚Äúpress him for a clear, unambiguous example of nearly anything, and Dorsey shuts down.‚Äù That is not unfair characterization IMHO. Third, I will thread in questions from audience, but to keep this non chaotic, let‚Äôs stay in one reply thread. #KaraJack
Oh hai @jack. Let‚Äôs set me set the table. First, I am uninterested in beard amulets or weird food Mark Zuckerberg served you (though WTF with both for my personal self). Second, I would appreciate really specific answers. #KaraJack

@ArlanWasHere @heylizelle Shocker. Papier-m√¢ch√© is less delicate than the aggrieved sensibilities of pampered Silicon Valley VCs. They had become so used to being licked up and down all day that a simple criticism sends them into a faint so extreme that there aren‚Äôt enough smelling salts in the world.
@heylizelle @ArlanWasHere @paulg Oh this was about his all man VC list? I almost said something about it, but what‚Äôs the use? So I made breakfast with my two teen sons and we talked about the sitch in Virginia government and the ever toxic issues of sexism and racism. Seemed a better use of my time.
@applegreentech @heylizelle @ArlanWasHere @paulg Need to figure out the sitch. No joke, I was napping
@heylizelle @ArlanWasHere @paulg Is this Paul Graham? Because we have had some rounds with him at Recode about petty reactions etc.

3/3 ... ‚ÄúIn brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character, a quality which, although approved in the abstract, sometimes loses ground to other, more instantly negotiable virtues.‚Äù
2/3 ... ‚ÄúIf they choose to commit adultery, they do not then go running, in an access of bad conscience, to receive absolution from the wronged parties; nor do they complain unduly of the unfairness, the undeserved embarrassment, of being named co-respondent ...‚Äù
1/3 Here‚Äôs a quote I wish a lot more people in general and very much in particular would grok from Joan Didion in ‚ÄúSlouching Towards Bethlehem: ‚ÄúLike Jordan Baker, people with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things ....‚Äù

@schneider @peterpham @aunkurarya Bingo
@JoshEdits @peterpham @aunkurarya It‚Äôs sneaky at the very least
@Anita4Tech Not even close to the same
@peterpham @aunkurarya They used a certificate that was meant for internal company apps like a cafeteria payment or whatever. It‚Äôs sneaky
@aunkurarya @peterpham @JoshEdits Exactly
@peterpham @JoshEdits @aunkurarya Because they used a side door to do it. Why not ask Apple? Because it was sneaky.
@philritz1 @CaseyNewton Ah just a coincidence. The FB thing was via TechCrunch, not Apple
@amhdeleon Oh was traveling yesterday. Sucky bug; they should have moved faster to announce; they did close it down and admit error in an adult way.
@chrisnachtrieb Hmm disagree

@peterpham @aunkurarya Wrong. They used an internal only back door to do it because Apple previously closed the front door

@ranimolla @nytimes @Recode Mostly me, right?
@webdevMason EVEN Kara Swisher!
@gwbaker @waltmossberg Thx
@gwbaker @waltmossberg I can hardly do it myself
@An_Dri_Na_smith @FullFrontalSamB No guns! Deal?
@brithennessy Thx
@An_Dri_Na_smith @NazarethII @realDonaldTrump @nazarethll Ah. I am only scared of scary people
@An_Dri_Na_smith @NazarethII @realDonaldTrump I admire his futile effort to deal with a bad situation.
@An_Dri_Na_smith @NazarethII @realDonaldTrump Only idiots think that anyone is a monolith. Let‚Äôs agree on that
@An_Dri_Na_smith @NazarethII @realDonaldTrump He was attempting to make it better and was woefully treated
@An_Dri_Na_smith @NazarethII @realDonaldTrump Big black men have scary powers to me? What? I think that Nathan Phillips was trying to help and was mistreated. Obviously.
@OSadler3 @emmeffemm @ybarselah Thx
Bingo. Collusion confusion: https://t.co/K7R6ibKYtm https://t.co/n65ruDRb2w
@lauraknystrom @Recode @SquawkCNBC Yep
@An_Dri_Na_smith @realDonaldTrump I think those teens acted badly but I still made the wrong comparison. Read your response to that perfectly reasonable action. Good lord.
@RealJamesWoods Hey James, I know you went to school with @waltmossberg and therefore should be able to keep up, but I absolutely left up the main tweet to preserve the record and just took down others as part of the apology. I was not hiding them, but you know that.
@neeraj @TuckerCarlson Heh
@An_Dri_Na_smith @realDonaldTrump You know you‚Äôre being just like what you decry. I simply should not have used that comparison. If you don‚Äôt like that, too bad
@SusanDuclos My both sons keep up just fine is expressing themselves. Listen to my oldest on the podcast
@SusanDuclos Obvi the second. We just disagree
@dittoheadbhm I don‚Äôt dismiss it you dope. We disagree
@dittoheadbhm @iamcardib And yet
@An_Dri_Na_smith But yes some bad video
@An_Dri_Na_smith That still does not mean I call them Nazis
@rstoddard @Mac_Prichard @AOC I love the phrase boy howdy

@ONLTEKK Go away bot
@MerrieW Huh. Gotta think
@curtprins @TuckerCarlson The Clown Manuever is a classic. ü§°
@Truthbe46567003 @sonic0357 That is true but there are other video less attractive that show them not as angels. Still, wrong to pile on so hard
@WeaponXFitness Thx
@muchmoresalt Oh stop.
@h4emtfr @jmurray829 @benwerd Thx. Pro tip: this is someone who has never read or watched
@K_and_Lyra Oh it‚Äôs just an expression. We just disagree
@peterdelevett @AOC Ah it was like that until recently and plenty of rich people stayed
@RickBColby Btw ever emerging videos show a very complex and confusing situation but I still should not have made the Nazi comparison
@MaxZiebell @benwerd Agreed. When they are older
@Ectobass @bdomenech Going to keep my donations local but thx
@kegill @lisasharper I saw
@Bigscouser Oh we just disagree
@jason_pontin @tlewis3348 @roleicht @antoniogm Oh man! Hat wars!
@dzadzey @jeffjarvis Nice
@thatsoftwareguy Oh that is perfect
@MRMV84 @AOC I am not worried
@pacificatch Thx
@lili_millar You do realize there are now many videos out in which these kids act horribly, but I still should not have used those terms and perhaps let their parents deal with that stuff.
@pangofilms I know

@jmurray829 @TuckerCarlson That‚Äôs what the print dudes used to tell me when I pointed out the Internet was going to be a big thing. But whatever dude
@OnaMouse Ha
@skaye @katzish @jack Have been trying to get him to talk to me.
@jmurray829 @benwerd You really have not listened to any. Can you read? https://t.co/qG4Zk8t0mk
@AIDSPol @FrEdwardBeck That‚Äôs my view too. Still should not have compared them to Nazis
@CathyYoung63 @verbaluce @RadioFreeTom Yes obvi
@katzish Hey
Here is the funny part of Twitter folks https://t.co/4y7xYrjxgI
Obvi @katzish is the smart one. https://t.co/P0U3kJUE4N
@FlyoverExpat @TuckerCarlson Oh pls you have no idea.
@jmurray829 @TuckerCarlson What‚Äôs radio? The millennials ‚Äî you know ones dying long after radio listeners ‚Äî don‚Äôt know either.
@NewsWatchDogUS @TuckerCarlson Vlad, let me help. We do not cap judge in America. It is black robes. And no one uses the word ‚Äúfancy‚Äù who comes from where you are pretending to come from. Now get some pelmini and type.
@CathyYoung63 @verbaluce @RadioFreeTom We can all agree Xena rocks
@BabyLydia1 @PatriciaHeaton @washingtonpost Let me help. I stopped working for the Washington Post in 1996. Only 23 years off. But you go girl
@NewsWatchDogUS @TuckerCarlson @BillKristol Did your parents give you that name by which I mean your Russian troll farm bosses.
@USrinivasan @TuckerCarlson I think I will.
@Freddie24495909 @TuckerCarlson To be fair, I was like this before. Also Tucker
@katharineramsde @TuckerCarlson No. That‚Äôs off limits
@DaveHormell1 @TuckerCarlson Oh yes. Great idea. Live! Come on Tucker.
@CamRon3030 @TuckerCarlson Beefcast
@wgrosso @TuckerCarlson Done
@eskimo1220 @TuckerCarlson Ah. He can handle it
@heycoop60 @TuckerCarlson Yeah I did. Try to keep up.
@Succinct_1 @TuckerCarlson This is me happy and my son thought up the clown as a funny burn
Hey @TuckerCarlson, it‚Äôs untalented me down here taping my Recode Decode podcast in DC. Really, harmless. Come closer. Totally safe Tucky. https://t.co/5H8AErbbfI
@gul_garak @themoko @RubinReport Sure. Listen to me and @rabois we def disagree
@wgrosso @TuckerCarlson I love that jacket
@docmeister @TuckerCarlson Also is Princeton Day School gals. Yeah I grew up rich, but Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson was much richer, as you must realize. He‚Äôs still richer than me.
@DanGreen23 @TuckerCarlson I am a terrible interviewer. Really. Shhhh.
Lastly my pal @themoko says she had a good time talking to you about Silicon Valley. But do not ask her about my rep. Like you said, I am a suck up! Sure! I am an old softie handmaiden to tech. Pie sweet! Do not listen to last Zuck podcast or 2008 interview. That was my evil twin
Also love your look @TuckerCarlson ‚Äî I am looking to get back to my whole preppy thing and you inspire. See here! I kind of look like you even #separatedatbirth https://t.co/uUgaBJi48k
By the way @TuckerCarlson, I want a FULL hour, so can‚Äôt do your 3 minute cable yellfest and plus I already worked long enough for Rupert (how are Uncle Satan‚Äôs  salt mines doing?). You know, since I am so bad at my job and all, it‚Äôd be nifty to learn from the best.
@phillyjyo Thx
@TonyMLucero What? I am untalented and poss NO HARM. https://t.co/5orURM04Nh
@DNAorg Hey I used colorful cartoon villains! Not real ones! This is me being nice
@eschuman But thx
Hey @TuckerCarlson since I‚Äôm such a suck-up of an interviewer &amp; so non-talented, come on my Recode Decode podcast and roll right over me with your fancy board school education (it is sure fancier than mine, but go PDS!) and smarty-pants mind (it‚Äôs all that Swanson food you ate!) https://t.co/8v6DWjJXaD
@eschuman Yes.
@mdennedy Woah
@joebaggadonutz1 @SophieInCT @YurgenFlurtz @TuckerCarlson Gotta cut you off. Like I said, civil
@joebaggadonutz1 And that would be none of your business, Dad.
@joebaggadonutz1 @ByronTau I appreciate it. But no one needs to hear from me beyond what I put here. I am answering civil people too. Like you.
@Captroy Oh I am very proud
@MrFubo @ybarselah I still never should have never used Nazi comparisons. Totally wrong.
@MrFubo @ybarselah See here: https://t.co/s1gYiJLDBF
@joebaggadonutz1 @ByronTau No because there are other videos out now that don‚Äôt show these kids in a very good light(see here: https://t.co/s1gYiJLDBF. With these dueling videos, it is really impossible to say anything clear except I was wrong to call them Nazis and should have waited to see full range.
@maggierauch @cmortolani @Gillette @TwitchyTeam Exactly
@SophieInCT @YurgenFlurtz @TuckerCarlson Is he a speck? I had heard that too
@ma Saw this. I am sorry I used the term nazis. They are obvi being jerks here.
@TheZed11 @RealSaavedra @KurtSchlichter Such a pushover (do you even read?): https://t.co/qG4Zk8t0mk
@joebaggadonutz1 @ByronTau No.
@jeremymstamper @cmortolani @Gillette @TwitchyTeam Exactly
@scooniepenn @secupp Oh this is yuk for sure
That‚Äôs the fatuous, babbling bow-tie dude on Fox who said immigrants make things dirtier? That guy? It‚Äôs like being insulted by Plankton from Spongebob Squarepants. Or maybe Simon Sinister from Underdog. Possibly Feathers McGraw. https://t.co/PX97wHnvZ8
@cmortolani @Gillette @TwitchyTeam I should not take the main one down. Sorry.
@mwzukerman @BillKristol Look in the mirror
@AutoTraveler I left the original tweet up you dope
@FrankChanged Stop pls. Just because I apologized does not mean I believe this kind of relentless blather about the media you spew
@1fever @mstearne @profgalloway Everyone thought Nike flopped
@1fever @mstearne @profgalloway We‚Äôll see when we see sales
@vinsmouse Thx.
@JasonSterlacci We‚Äôll see.
@The_Colonialist And bye
@Carniala1 Oh stop
@mravantcentre Thx. They don‚Äôt bother me
@Darryl0007 Please
@msagenyc No, I will not m. Both sides do a great job of doing that all the time.
@TobyandMel Oh we‚Äôll be fine.
@DwayneCecil1 Thx
@GreatClout You prove my point
@markrmeyer And you have proved my point
@ybarselah I have not seen this stuff. My point is I wrote without knowing
@Fools2234 Go away
@marcs_karl No I did not. Wrong person
@tessmissing Dead name? I was noting that the right folks who were trashing me were calling me that. I think it was gross.
@AthanasiusAg Well that is a little far. Just was wrong here to act so soon
@ASchmitz85 No
@TurfGuy08 Thx
@DofDemocracy Yeah
@svtiramisu Bruce
@DigitalSalesGuy Yeah. Just that weird smirk was so off putting. I will take that kid at his word, but it was creepy on its face
@suzhorton @Gillette I should not have used Nazi and I should have waited. I may very well think those kids acted like louts, but needed to do the work
@AgStisme @suzhorton @Gillette Thx
@Kendiz Deal
@ThatJPWing I do like cussing
@fishnbaja1 Try
@leighbeesays But a lot of Swishers down that way
@MikeShowerrug Well
@Delray881 Thx
@Jauffins Ah I am not made of papier mache.
@jdever @bbennettesq Yep
@sparkzilla I watched it
@Miabella4u He is not a man yet but I let him have his opinion and he lets me have mine
@Mailtrucker552 That is what he says
@Couple_o_toes Me and my son just disagree on an ad. Step off
@MoiseCummings He thinks so
@mblafkin Well my 16 year old son loves it
@mpcrider Fair
@nina_silk @cfowler1850 A view I deplore but again
@bsector44 And bye
@GilbertDilbert1 Really? That‚Äôs all you can come up with?
@CageyBee33 Now yer both wrong
@h0tr0d9 Mostly men but sometimes women ;)
@Factsaresafe Well if it took on real issues that women fall down on
@callsign24 @PatedBears @SalTrifilio Bye!
@PatedBears @SalTrifilio Just cannot tell. The tomahawk nonsense was not cool
@drivewest @itnor1 Agreed. I was sorry for my react. Their tomahawk gestures and other stuff was appalling
@NewEricHoffer @getongab Thx
@MamaBurf They are still not Nazis
@TheAndrewWyatt @MikeIsaac 54 I tried
@drivewest Not as much
@LessThanLiz Exactly
@Dalex_60 Thx
@DK1RK We are all not the monolith you think
@LNEnriquez @peterjhasson Thx
@sonic0357 Fair
@josh24601 Blessed be

@guydbennett @getongab Thx!
@fakeryanmills Thx
@mardoqueo1986 I do
@rustydusty55 Thx. I am yelling at him to pick up his room right now
@kolsonkjo Thx!
@StephenAShirley Thx
@quasi1670 Coming soon how is the snow
@jason_pontin @BtterThanDayman I should have called them louts then and not Nazis
So THIS is when @antoniogm is nice to me. https://t.co/JfmoAA77LY
@jason_pontin @antoniogm Not sure old guy was a crank. But ok!
@ThyDailyBraap And scene! exactly the kind of jackass I would be happy to strafe here
@Jbird433 Please stop
@TREMediaNews @dangainor Yeah that
@Mcinfo1 https://t.co/OMh9eThViR
@hammondbarry667 I am apologizing for not waiting and also making a Nazi compare on that rushed tweet. I do not know what happened yet
@ChipD82 No. If I delete all, the right makes up that I am trying to pretend I did not say it
@Fishy_Fischer This is still complicated by even more video in which no one looks good. I should not have used the Nazi comparison at all and should have waited to comment. This was not permssion for you to be a jackass to me tho
@The_Real_Snooze I am doing it for my kids
@taylor_jacob Ahahaaa. GILLETTE!
@itnor1 Because I overreacted.
@ybarselah No it is not clear. I should have waited and looked at all the videos and then tweeted. Maybe it would be the same. Maybe not. I certainly should not have compared them to Nazi. Anyone deserves that
@lukeinproperty Once he gets debate training I am done
@casper6688 No!
@David_lucian0 Oh dear. No one likes a tampon commercial
@DeisterB Ha. He‚Äôs frequently wrong but never in doubt. My other son love the ad
@cfowler1850 Ah they can wear a hat
@im2b I saw
@mattyrosen Ah. It is not fair the comparison i used to nazis
@eileendt5 That‚Äôs what I told my son!
@RichardJSiegel Yeah. But I never should have made a Nazi comparison
@bruceableson Yeah I saw those too but should have waited to make a comment
@AltcoinShaman Um not sure anyone is innocent and some new videos make it clear what a mess it was. but I should have not made that Nazi compare.
@jeremymstamper Fair point
@Khornefed Deal
@DigitalSalesGuy Well I still think the Charlottesville Nazis suck. But yes
@Jauffins I can take it and should
@CAVandy Thx
@StuartLily4 Thx
@Mc_Somnus Tomorrow!
@bbennettesq Yes but I compared them to nazis. That was wrong
@thepatriotbelle @LogicalRightNow Ah. Not creative enough. You right types need to up your insult game.
@LogicalRightNow Hmm I will take moron for $50
@timmerenginerd Thx
@Dan_Donovan_17 Will do
@mbdcares This may be true but there are levels. My use of Nazi compare wrong
@_TedG_ Well that yes
@afahy I agree. But not quite what I said either (like Nazis). It‚Äôs complicated and I should have waited.
@McClintockMarc Ah. I should have done more research. Still much video emerging and still unclear. I should look at it all
@ybarselah No. I said it was a complex situation. I should have waited before weighing in
@ethank Ah for my kids.
@John_W @ClaraJeffery Wow life is complex. Incredible
@twinkle_1990 You need to also look at other videos. My apology also does not mean that I want to listen to your dreck
@Frogger_Jones No. Should stay. I debated this with myself
@hammondbarry667 I saw
@ChipD82 No
@nzyank Ah. Better self
@yesandnoisaid I kept the main tweet. I also don‚Äôt need your crap
@nectargirl @lukeinproperty Not all
@lukeinproperty Well they were being jerky at times but ...
@SalTrifilio Yeah that part was gross
@AFC1967 Complete dolt?
@Fishy_Fischer Hey I never pretend I am not liberal nor do I cover politics. So step off
@jason_pontin Yeah. No one does
@ethank Yeah.
@ybarselah My apology does not mean that advice like yours is welcome
@TheBlueApe I saw the Tomahawk thing and the making fun of the old man. My response was still overdone
@BriannaWu @ClaraJeffery Hmm let me see if I can find a link. Still it is honestly murky
@ClaraJeffery Even if so (I get it) but I just don‚Äôt know. So I should have backed off.
Lastly, some called for me to apologize, so thanks except for those who also felt the need to also add that I look like Bruce Jenner (tho fair point). Others will not accept my apology, which is fine, so keep smacking as I can and should take it.
Just for the record, I still like the ad, even if my son thinks it is awful man-shaming. He‚Äôs wrong but he is right when he told me yesterday to ‚Äústop being mad on Twitter.‚Äù Also cursing: Bad.
I was a complete dolt to put up this and several other obnoxious tweets yesterday without waiting to see the whole video of the incident and I apologize to the kids from Kentucky unilaterally and also for using that clip to make another point about, of all things, a razor ad.
@m2jr Ok now I have to pay for lunch
@DigitalSalesGuy I really do not pretend I am not exactly a conservative
@GJohnston2014 @Zimrico @BillKristol @pattonoswalt @Alyssa_Milano @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @maggieNYT @JoeNBC @chrislhayes @ananavarro I left up main one for all eternity
@JebKinnison @Reboticant I am not a political writer and only do that when it veers into tech (like AOC versus Trump on Twitter). I should prolly stay out of politics. I think it hit me as a parent in the wrong way. Will talk about it this week and also apologize on Pivot.
@JebKinnison @Reboticant I get it. I made a mistake. Will be apologizing on main tweet. Only took others down since they were obnoxious. The main one stayed since I was not trying to pretend I did not say it. Was not fleeing my mistake
@John95694724 Yes thx. But those are not my people.
@eugeneotool @nytimes I left main one up (in order not to pretend I did not jump the gun), but felt others should be removed because they were just obnoxious.
@Zimrico @BillKristol @pattonoswalt @Alyssa_Milano @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @maggieNYT @JoeNBC @chrislhayes @ananavarro I kept the original tweet up, so as not to look like I never said it.
@Reboticant @JebKinnison I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Those initial protestors were definitely vile toward them and many others there.
@JebKinnison @Reboticant Yeah I am well known for kissing up to tech. I am going to focus on your pertinent Lewis quote, Jeb.
@NWInfidel @sshotbot I left the original tweet and took down the follows. Go look.
@JebKinnison Thx. I love CS Lewis
@Mandelliant Yeah!
@MGMurray1 Fair
@ccarr1025 Of course and thanks
@jslemaker Fair
@Armyactor Cuba? I have never been to Cuba.
@CorleoneSolo Very funny. Point to you. I left the original up tho.
@GunDogJay You‚Äôre right.
@daveconrey @guyraz The Daily is @mikiebarb but I confuse them all the time ;)
@t_xu No! I go out!
@hunterp Maybe! Just making a point
@Ackattackack @seanux I think that gif is a joke
@llcthecableguy Oh dunk why not
@anneengo @iamcardib Did not see. I loved the first
@etlipman @sundarpichai @jack @POTUS @lessig @SamHarrisOrg There are also too many witnesses saying opposite of what kids saying. That said, this Hebrew Israelite group worst.
@etlipman @sundarpichai @jack @POTUS @lessig @SamHarrisOrg This is best account: https://t.co/LFEIoU6f1W
@etlipman @arikarikari I just blocked him
@arikarikari @etlipman And you prove the point! Bye!
https://t.co/KsWxJsUYwq
@idrankwhat3 @etlipman That is true
@roirigoyen Hmm not sure all men shaming
@JimmySt28089821 @pfrazier Heh
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Oh not getting into this as a lapsed catholic! Night!
@etlipman Hmm. That weird smirk and he was def too close. The kids near mocking the chanting and he never stopped the truly creepy glare. It just makes no sense. Why not try to engage? Or make the older man feel safe. The only person who truly acted peacefully was the old man.
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 My kid and I had a lively debate about it. He said it was man-shaming and my oldest loved it. ‚ÄòMerica
@etlipman @SamHarrisOrg @lessig @MichelleObama Yeah.
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Just twice so far. silly kids is what I thought (and ignored them as they were just being snarky, not very clever with the insults and were in no way scary, though it was not a lot of them). One thing: i wear it all the time on sf and never a word, except compliments. 2americas
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Ha. I have one that says: Make San Francisco Gay Again
Heh https://t.co/tVMUJKHST8
@etlipman @sundarpichai @jack @ACLU @lessig @SamHarrisOrg Read the NYT account. As clear as mud and it was best account. A bad situation escalated.
@etlipman @sundarpichai @jack @POTUS @lessig @SamHarrisOrg Hmm still not a mistake
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Yes also as a mother. Eek, what a task in today‚Äôs world. FYI, my 13 year old hated the Gillette commercial
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 I have been taunted by several (always young men and always clearly from out of town) for being a gay in a pretty gay area of dc. I was wearing a hoodie that said badass and queer on the back. Always with the hats.
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 @SamHarrisOrg I am a world class terrible meditator
@idrankwhat3 @etlipman Because it‚Äôs also clear (from what I can see) that these kids were not just joking. I would be horrified if my kids did anything but make that man feel safe. But fair point.
@etlipman Not sure harmless. That kid was not comforting that old man, he was scaring him even though he says now he did not intend it. And that old man was in no way menacing.
@etlipman @SamHarrisOrg @lessig Def but that was child‚Äôs play compared to what is coming
@etlipman @SamHarrisOrg @lessig Hmm not all tribes. What about that gang of marchers in Charlottesville? Methinks this would make a great column
@etlipman thx for your thoughtful tweets
@etlipman This is a very fair point. What will be worse is when the ability to alter these videos becomes flawless (close). There is a whole debate about this. It's an ugly world out there online and off.
@etlipman I am watching all the videos and I do not agree. You cannot tell what is going on easily and I suspect the kindest thing to say is that we will not ever know.
@gabemott @profgalloway we discussed this week
@batjargaln writing about it this week I think
@m2jr @mherrick66 Good article
@iDiplomacy Oh god
@SamTheGeek Fair point. But I was making a larger point about voyeurism in this amplified age. We think everything is up for grabs.
I talk ‚Äúwoke‚Äù with ‚Å¶@profgalloway‚Å© who is ‚Äúin a relationship with Jeff Bezos‚Äù on Pivot podcast. https://t.co/WPcThKxw6b
@shawndubravac I have a reason and will talk about it on my live twitter on Tuesday
@kyle_maurer_ @OneoftheGracers Yes
@Conrguy @Jukebox_Hobo Stop
@steve4995 Pansy? As if I would bite. They are lovely flowers btw
@DoucheBag1973 Yeah but sometimes not. See Apple 1984 ad. Also this did work with women, you know the ones who actually buy the razors and raise the boys
@yoda Never
@yoda I wish they had not
@m2jr We will have that lunch
@yoda @mscccc @m2jr I mansplain them!
@m2jr These kids have been soaked in hate and I don‚Äôt want to lead them to a teachable moment. The right consistently plays us to be nice, even as they drag us down. You know when the gay movement turned? When we got angry and stayed that way.
@m2jr I did not mean it to be helpful. In any way.
@jamesmitchem7 @seanin2019 But everyone I hate is actually Goebbels.
@jamesmitchem7 @seanin2019 Ok that is funny
@earcity Yeah. No.
@kubakostecki Most gay people
@kubakostecki My kid
@kubakostecki It does not shame kids. Lord. Watch it
@mscccc @m2jr @yoda How many mikes are there? Oh, Pence.
@m2jr Also I did not say it was a solution for these kids. But as the mother of two teen boys, you cannot imagine how hard we try to make them be their best in a world that makes it too easy to do your worst. Like those kids did.
@ctophfranko You need eyes
@from_ottawa Hmm
@DoucheBag1973 Ah. Come on
@Conrguy @Jukebox_Hobo Oh stop
@Suffragentleman What? Good lord. Try harder
@Freddie24495909 Exactly
@davidmuiredin Huh?
@mike4ty4 YouTube likes are notoriously gamed
@locoloic Huh? This is not the same
@LJCadin @ProcterGamble Good idea
@jjgalletta Btw I never mind decent feedback
@jjgalletta Thx!!
@jjgalletta Totes agreed. All of them until they figured out ladies buy the razors not dudes
@zampella Not at all! I liked seeing it in a good way. Well done except I am really short and really bad at basketball so could not swish
@m2jr Thank for the lecture dad. These kids are a menace.
@KOnocomment It is secretly a lesbian crush song
@KOnocomment Def
@jolondon @swapp19902 @ByronTau One for one
@kubakostecki Oh please
@alexkinsella Done
@matthausmann Try this: https://t.co/sm4vmtFPQ0

@DiChiro Oh the parents and teachers. Fuck them. My kids did this and there would be hell to pay. And they‚Äôd pay it.
@GeoffUtley @ByronTau I like to call him Uncle Satan

@swapp19902 @ByronTau I am calling them that. See my other answer. I am pretty up to speed on what this represents
@christiankinney @ByronTau Hot Topic!
@swapp19902 @buffoonbuster @ByronTau I used it very carefully and I have never used this term as yet until today. My minor in college was to study the Holocaust and the uses of propaganda and swarms just like this. This is how it began in Germany. Nazi fits perfectly.
@lindentreegroup @ByronTau The Wsj will do squat
And to all you aggrieved folks who thought this Gillette ad was too much bad-men-shaming, after we just saw it come to life with those awful kids and their fetid smirking harassing that elderly man on the Mall: Go fuck yourselves. https://t.co/ab7zqIuWbL
Gee @ByronTau, being happy there were no cameras when I wore cowl necks &amp; clogs and screamed in the front row at the Styx concert is not the same as taking part in Nazi Youth 2019. Also: I hope this follows these truly awful teens for the rest of their thus-far pathetic lives. https://t.co/yqxvMKSK6j

3. While things change, my recollection of the rapport of the Bezos‚Äô way back when was always that they were pretty steady and no drama people. With 4 kids, I would be shocked if there were contentiousness to warrant an impact on Amazon.
2. All Things D (which morphed to @Recode) wrote about the Google founder Sergey Brin‚Äôs divorce, which was much dicier since there were also work issues, and it eventually moved along. And Oracle‚Äôs Larry Ellison has had a few too.

@nmeyersohn Fair point. But inevitable trickle down
@HotlineJosh @AOC Deal.
@espiers @HotlineJosh What she said
@HotlineJosh And it was not an attack, but a reaction. I, for one, try to listen when anyone makes a fair point
@HotlineJosh Btw there was a broader set of issues at CBS. It was called Les Moonves and Charlie Rose.
@HotlineJosh It is in no way tsk-tsking by @AOC to point out that you have zero African American staffers. She is making a fair observation that it is a deficit for CBS. To then link her with Trump (who is essentially trying to criminalize the media) is also just odd way to defend yourself.
@theoldcfo Hey you never know
That‚Äôs not what @AOC said @HotlineJosh. Not clear why you can‚Äôt just admit she has a point that media needs more diverse staffing. We have this issue in tech media and I can tell you ‚Äî as hard as we try ‚Äî we definitely come up short. Pretending it‚Äôs not an issue seems obtuse. https://t.co/mxhsoPIRmh

@jdgalarneau Hmm too nice
@jason_pontin @antoniogm @kevin2kelly @WIRED Ah. Now Ocasio is the standard bearer I guess
@PearlF @antoniogm Yeah. I have never thought of theranos as a tech company. We never covered it at Recode except maybe related to Ellison.
@rabois @RolfeWinkler I would agree there with Keith. Who‚Äôs your best option on existing board. Hastings too busy, Bowles too tsk-tsking, Andreessen as if, Thiel too hot potato. Who‚Äôs left?
@antoniogm @jason_pontin @kevin2kelly @WIRED Sorry what is a DSA
@n_mccarthy_ Say hi. Obvi
@RolfeWinkler @rabois By the way listen to Keith on my Recode Decode podcast talking about FB controversy as being overblown. Ever the contrarian.
@RolfeWinkler @rabois Yay. It was just a guess with weird board comings and goings. I have largely said on pivot I did not expect mark to give up either seat. Why should he and there is little pressure.
@zachtratar @antoniogm @jason_pontin No be fair many did express that it was scammy too. Not blockchain tech as much tho
@webjournalist @mrgrim151 Fair point but a much cleaner platform
@rabois Yeah not so tho

@antoniogm @jason_pontin Again I spent more time with VCs ‚Äî sadly ‚Äî than both of you. They never shut up despite my constantly rolling up in my head eyes
@antoniogm It was a lot of dough.
@antoniogm Well fair on Draper. Theranos was def not a tech company anyways

@moenichedee I hang in Shaw
@TorstenBeeck I saw
@onetomany @PreetBharara What part? I like some of it
@waltmossberg @Hip2Housewife @PreetBharara Thx Walt. People often are put off when women are confident and like to slag it. You‚Äôre too secure to be bothered by it.

@neithernor @PreetBharara I know. I meant dismal
I am going out on a limb here and say that he is not tech savvy even if he is the biggest twitter troll of all time. https://t.co/qm06T6CLAF
@antoniogm And yet it can be the case and really is if you talk to anyone one the ground there.
@antoniogm Having holiday lunch. Back soon. https://t.co/sjeCjxadGZ
@antoniogm Oh man. Now you lost me
@antoniogm Btw this is a GOOD debate
@antoniogm But these are decisions by essentially private firms as to the kinds of customers they want. Companies and people do this all the time
@antoniogm Yes obvi
@jaypinho @antoniogm They make the only rules that matter
@jaypinho @antoniogm What he said
@antoniogm I do not think others are not players. I think fb is the nexus player, hence greater responsibility
@antoniogm This is fair.
@antoniogm Hmm disagree here
@antoniogm Now you are parsing again. Is oxygen at fault for letting alex Jones breathe?
@antoniogm Well phew. Also makes the rules of engagement
@antoniogm More whataboutism that ignore very real worries about the centrality of fb to this equation
@antoniogm That is what unnerves me
@antoniogm See mark‚Äôs weak responses to me on that on podcast despite repeated and fair efforts to get him to comment.
@antoniogm I said that to you!
@antoniogm Also there have been so many instances of FB slow rolling on some practices that might give pause that they def have lost trust. It is tho something that can be won back (see uber)
@antoniogm Let‚Äôs ignore that one, but really and truly would love a reflection by you on why people are so unnerved with FB practices
@baltch @rebzsays @cher @profgalloway @nishatjaan @inafried We do not do guests but thx
@henryrose @PreetBharara Af
@thebenshouse @themoko Ok!
When you lose both @waltmossberg and @cher you are fucked. https://t.co/oCNECQJZpe
@rebzsays @cher @profgalloway @nishatjaan Oh man
@paulfroberts @nytimes Ha.
@sirmichael @joerogan Sure!
@markjdouglas @antoniogm Exactly. It‚Äôs a moment
@TCamps @PreetBharara Me short
@mauprieto @antoniogm Btw quoting that dude to me does you no service to the idea that you are a non elite
@mauprieto @antoniogm I meant him you goon. Sorry a vestige of my dad‚Äôs family‚Äôs southern roots. Good lord is another, so good lord.
@bertkaufman @msalbergo @binarybits @nytimes Agreed!
@BillyMallard @PreetBharara Sorry. I do know that of course. I was meaning dismal in the glum way of, say, a slowmoving gloom.

@antoniogm I get that but fair criticism would be welcome
@aryeha @katecrawford @starkness @profgalloway Done
@ForGoodnessAche @MTPDaily @facebook @MSNBC Yes but not even close to the same amplification
Great analysis by @KurtWagner8 https://t.co/HojaV6fQI7
@GetItDoneGuy Going to pass
@antoniogm Instead a lot of finger pointing at others rather than truly assessing what Facebook does that might make some queasy.
@antoniogm Also the fact that you almost never critically assess the behavior of Facebook, preferring to attack the media, says lots. Love to understand why you think many smart people have issues with the company
@hristo_vassilev @antoniogm And they have been written about a ton. Want all the links. The reason the focus is on Facebook is that it is the biggest consumer facing service
@antoniogm Also Antonio you all still do not get what is happening here by continually ignoring the issues people have with Facebook by parsing words. This report is not saying Facebook sells your data. It says it shares data without consent, it questions how Facebook handles data it has
@antoniogm Yeah those were the ones Facebook had deals with right?
@comagine @nytimes Hmm no idea
@thebenshouse @themoko It is not
FYI, @waltmossberg has come out of retirement for this one and you all should be very scared. https://t.co/NaTvfUGDhq

@zomgjon @profgalloway Obviously. You might want to wander over to a famous interview that @waltmossberg and I did of Zuckerberg in 2007 about this issue.
@grcanty @WSJ @nytimes @washingtonpost @amazon @PostBaron The post has done great coverage of these abuses
@arlogilbert Not sure it is a crime but yes

@SaukFish @IlvesToomas It‚Äôs not clear if it is fraudulent, any more than any of the many ways your data is mined is, egregious as it is. Regulators need to act to create a privacy bill with teeth.
@jennymirken @nytimes They are not
@Timmahooooo Not sure it is criminal. It is overreach
@davidgaliel @IlvesToomas You don‚Äôt need to overstate the business of data mining that was always there. What‚Äôs worse here is lack of care of handling the data
@azeem Just badly deployed like beacon etc along with the basic concept of information sucking up
@nickbertolino Deliberate in their goals to use user data, but how they managed it was really sloppy

To be clear, this crowd‚Äôs persistent obsession with blaming shaming for everything is exhausting, but this happens to be a very well articulated version of why it is important to keep in mind how these online tools are badly used.
