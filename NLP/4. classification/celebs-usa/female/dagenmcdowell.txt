@wells_borie @markrmorley You could confiscate every single dollar of adjusted gross income earned by the top 1% annually and you’ll still be more than $1 TRILLION short every year in paying for Medicare for All.
@schn_john The Sanders bill that Harris backs would prohibit any insurer, including any employer, from covering benefits and services provided through the government system.
@TFab1474 That’s what the Bernie bill keeps: the VA.
Sen. Kamala Harris’s idea to abolish private health insurance in the US is neither new nor surprising. She endorsed the Bernie Sanders “Medicare-for-All” bill, which does just that along with eliminating Medicare as it exists today. You like your current insurance? Say goodbye.

@NJMax4 Part of it.
I’ve said this for two years: When the President takes credit for the stock market going UP, then he also owns it on the way DOWN. If his policies (tax cuts, deregulation) were partially responsible for the rally, then policy/posturing are in part behind the recent rout.

My take ahead of the Federal Reserve decision: The Central Bank definitely raises short-term interest rates today. No hike would signal those brainiacs already think we’re headed into a recession. And would freak the market out.

@Douglas85566505 @RichardGrenell Yes in some quarters, most recently as 3Q 2014. But in any one calendar year the economy never grew at even a 3% rate.

@Kovossier @david413 @MorningsMaria @MariaBartiromo @cherylcasone 💪💪💪💪
@InvisibleHand78 @realDonaldTrump Other nations actually are retaliating against US because of OUR NEW steel and aluminum tariffs. POTUS actually tweeted “tariffs are the greatest” 3 days ago.
@PatsyO1963 I’m positive about the trade truce with Europe. But the remaining steel and aluminum tariffs are hurting businesses and costing jobs.
@GregPelfrey Tariffs are a tax. They destroy more jobs than they create. And hurt businesses and consumers in the US.
@SteveNicklas1 Tariffs are a tax on businesses and consumers and destroy many more jobs than they create. I stand by that. They’re a bad idea and the ones we have belched up so far are still in place. Might want to take a breath before you claim victory.

@ZFLife28 And the “approach” of tariffs are hurting more American businesses than helping. This $12 billion in welfare to farmers is trying to fix a problem created by this Administration.
@ZFLife28 Well, I wouldn’t be talking about a trade deficit as a “debt” we owe. It is not. It’s an accounting mechanism.
@jacham111 We are and they’re crushing AMERICAN businesses. Ridiculous.

@Abnerandall Do you understand how the supply chain works? Even products made in America contain parts made in other countries. You hurt American businesses (and consumers) and destroy jobs by making those parts and goods more expensive with stupid tariffs.
@Hermit_Crab1 @MelissaAFrancis So sorry for your loss. Blessings to you. 🙏
Call the people you love and tell them so. Right now. Today. Do not wait. Your parents. Your children. Your siblings, relatives, dearest friends. Near and far. Do not text them. Call. Say I love you. You will not regret this.
@mustango223 My mother’s family farmed. Don’t lecture someone who actually knows better.
@PJANE Then he should know about the jobs in this country that were destroyed by the Bush steel tariffs. More jobs lost than the entire number of people employed in the steel industry at the time. Winning.

@MbRoss65 @axios Not made up.
Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin tells @MariaBartiromo the @Axios story on @realDonaldTrump considering WTO withdrawal isn’t right and says the story is an “exaggeration.”
@Hoosier84 @stevenmnuchin1 @realDonaldTrump I have said that repeatedly.
Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin on China: “We’re not in a trade war. We’re in a trade dispute.” To @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness
@gardenmastering This is not a rumor
Important story for markets today.  Bluster? Perhaps. Worth noting: The U.S. wins about 90% of cases it brings before the WTO. And as the article points out withdrawal from the WTO would require an ACT OF CONGRESS. https://t.co/Z7sh8EtuF3

@wtucker956 Nope it’s foreign companies being punished despite the fact they employ 10s of thousands of US workers making autos here.
@RustyBelinda Then WE should get rid of our 25% tariff on imported trucks.
@kennyhatmaker Foreign auto companies make more cars in the US THAN THE DETROIT 3. So we intentionally hurt those companies and their AMERICAN WORKERS? BS
@NoMoreElitists Auto parts
Warning from the auto industry’s trade group: Trump administration’s threat of a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles would be a $45 billion tax on consumers, destroying any benefits from a tax cut for low-and middle-income Americans. https://t.co/VDOv0qrsIO

@AslowAl Tell that to the American workers who will lose their jobs because of this hamhanded policy that not even The President’s own advisors can agree on.
@ruthsmartcookie Yep and these tariffs are driving more jobs overseas. See Harley. Duh.

@TAGHeuer Horrible service and treatment. Your employees need to learn to say, “We are so sorry this happened. How can we fix it?”
@TAGHeuer @vvertel You replied to the wrong person. Wrong tweet. I am the one with the watch.
@BG97942685 @TAGHeuer This watch worked fine. I took great care of it. Wore it on air every day. I sent it in for cleaning , service. It was returned w/a damaged, filthy clasp + a band that was obliterated. Not even a “Sorry” from the new Fifth Ave. Store or repair rep. Treat the customer like a POS.

@hiddenhandsz @aretuseo77 Actual economic growth. A high-quality standard of living.

Tariffs work? Uh, no. More US workers LOST jobs (-200K jobs destroyed) due to Bush’s steel tariffs in 2002 than were employed by the entire steel industry (187,500). Hitting Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania. Economic and political mistake.

@Nascarjunky18 @KennedyNation @DennisDMZ @MZHemingway @JessicaTarlov @Jamie_Weinstein @BuckSexton @michiokaku @FoxBusiness Gas tax is a user fee. It isn’t high enough to cover basic federal road repair. Then you don’t get your Interstate fixed any longer with someone else’s INCOME tax dollars. Spend Spend Spend as long as someone ELSE is paying for it. Very liberal idea.
@MorchaBob @KennedyNation @DennisDMZ @MZHemingway @JessicaTarlov @Jamie_Weinstein @BuckSexton @michiokaku @FoxBusiness People who use the roads should pay to fix them. They don’t. If highway trust fund doesn’t have enough money which it hasn’t in years, don’t take money from general revenue. Drivers aren’t paying enough for federal road repair. Period.
@markflesberg @KennedyNation And NEW YORK CONTRIBUTED $48 BILLION *MORE* in federal TAXES than the state received IN FEDERAL SPENDING. THIS STATE IS A GIVER TO THE FEDERAL FISC. NOT A TAKER LIKE MANY MANY STATES. DO SOME RESEARCH.
@Swicky427 Not the subway bud.
@StitchJonze @KennedyNation My *federal* income tax dollars should not pay to fix the Interstate in Missouri that I don’t use. GAS TAX IS A USER FEE. USER SHOULD PAY WHAT IT TAKES TO FIX THE ROADS. Money should stop coming rro@ general revenue.

@clydedotson Yes federally if someone is committed INVOLUNTARILY to  mental hospital or if a court declares someone mentally incompetent. State laws vary dramatically.
@BobGreene333 @MorningsMaria It was meant as an absurd hypothetical. These political talking points on “mental illness” are meaningless. What’s the R plan? A database tracking people in treatment? Violation of civil liberties.
@sicat2 THAT WAS A HYPOTHETICAL!! These politicians need to pressed on WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO when they regurgitate this”mental illness” talking point.
@kijstrack Because that’s ridiculous and impossible to define legally
@MariaGambreli I encourage Republicans to stop using this (“mental illness”) as an empty talking point and political crutch.
@RichardKarnes Then the politicians who use this talking point after every mass shooting need to come up with a PLAN rather than using this verbiage crutch.
@david413 Children of the disabled, deceased, retired can also receive SS. “Mental illness” is a go-to talking point for many. Politicians who voted to rescind this rule should be asked why.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @NBSaphierMD My point is: When a politician says “mental illness” is the real problem they need to answer WHAT THAT MEANS. What do they want done.
@hellion2172 Whoa
@FNC_Ladies_Rule The issue: Many politicians use “mental illness” as a talking point. Anyone who voted for this should be asked why.  AND not just retired workers receive SS benefits. Like the disabled or children of retired, deceased or disabled workers. To be clear.
@MikFin The issue: “mental illness” is a talking point. Then politicians should speak to this.
@plettkeman Certainly worth asking lawmakers who voted to get rid of this rule why they voted that way — if “mental illness” is the real problem. A talking point for some.

@farragutmrg Yes the individual tax cuts expire (which I’ve said REPEATEDLY) because of procedural rules to get the reform done. Up to Congress to make them permanent. Right and left. Corporate tax cuts were permanent because businesses wouldn’t make new investments without that certainty.

@debitking @RVARamFan Refundable tax credit against payroll tax liability. Payroll taxes go to fund a BENEFITS TO THE INDIVIDUAL (Medicare and SS) so others will have to pay for that. Welfare.
@MaxPuckerFactor Refundable against the payroll tax liability which pays for an individual benefit (SS/Medicare) that someone else would have to pay for? Welfare.

@FNC_Ladies_Rule @garybsmith @JCLayfield @JonasFerris Thank you!!!!
@WAGongaware @writesbooks @garybsmith @ChuckRocha That’s not accurate. That money is spent on infrastructure. In fact Highway Trust Fund has to take from general revenue ie. income tax revenue because the gas tax doesn’t fully cover road repair.
It IS ALSO a revenue issue. Deficit grew in last two years. Revenue only up 1% because economy wasn’t growing fast enough. https://t.co/hV2JTFIsQh

To those who want more government control over health care: Read up on eugenics programs in the US. 32 states sterilized over 60K people.
@boomerbayb @DepartmentS Eliminating a couple of govt. agencies won't fill a $50 TRILLION hole. And that's just Medicare.
@ToonDrB Correct!
To paraphrase @JudgeJudy, the Republicans should put their listening ears on. #2018midterms https://t.co/vkrrkEPXDw
And THAT, dear sir, is my point. A $50 trillion unfunded liability for Medicare alone. What would single-payer for ALL do to US finances? https://t.co/1SvLFiEBlB
@24hrTVMazi @KennedyNation @FoxBusiness @AmbJohnBolton @MBCompanyMan About time! Ha! Thank you!!
@DeborahKenmir The government runs the medical facilities and pays the doctors, nurses and other providers.
Medicare is single-payer. The VA is full-on socialized medicine. https://t.co/hTUjhMkXG1

POTUS @realDonaldTrump says he'd be happy to testify under oath as to those conversations with Comey.
AND POTUS @realDonaldTrump says he'd gladly talk to special counsel Mueller about his conversations w/Comey, which the President disputes.
POTUS @realDonaldTrump says he didn't ask Comey to pledge his loyalty and didn't ask him to let Flynn investigation go.
@MTSantoleri No what I was said: he was being TREATED THAT WAY AND HE IS NOT.
