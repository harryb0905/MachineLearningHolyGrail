Unfortunately not usually, otherwise it would be called something else. A bond is the term used when you have a past with that person or y’all went through something specific together, it’s not always tied to a consistent relationship of any kind. https://t.co/eHUdVyLFwI
Hahahahahahahahaha omg https://t.co/BwdIIYUF6J
@ParisLynnnn_ But you real with yourself so !
We all learn these lessons somehow! https://t.co/KGaYsjo2ZL

Common sense tells me that guy ain’t for me if he ain’t choose me. Therefore he’s lame and I dodged a bullet! Lol
I never understand how girls decide to hate on another girl just because the guy they want likes her instead.

@3Thais3 @KehlaniToOhio Yes and you came across that way totally. You are appreciated beautiful girl! We all have obstacles but we all will overcome them when we focus on the right things! Okayyyyy
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 Yes girl it gave me life and it didn’t get too shady ;-)
Omg gurl this is a girls talk session !!! I love hearing folks stories about experiences and I never judge!! https://t.co/rBNp0rNj38
Right right. I just wonder how differently she would’ve behaved if it was a woman instead. https://t.co/jeVp7zJGiO
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 I don’t think she was using it as a card I think she was giving her opinion that she feels it’s something that’s affected me. But that’s her opinion just like you have yours ❤️
@LaTesaLins Did he take action tho?? I haven’t watched all the episodes. I feel like it being the same sex shouldn’t make it any worse than the opposite unless he’s saying he wants to make a complete lifestyle change. Mmm idk
@High_iM_Paul Thank u so much!! One day man one day.
Tell us the story sis 👀👀 https://t.co/hvjjarlHIC
I haven’t had the time or I should say didn’t make the time because of my other career. My last tour was with Disney when I was like 14 hahaha. https://t.co/yNfF3uYnet
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 I think she referred to charting but to me charting doesn’t mean talented but it is a form of success. But what you’re saying is similar to saying Samuel Jackson isn’t a Star or isn’t as talented as Denzel because he doesn’t have an Oscar. U know?
@KokoLupa Hahahahahaha
Yes Ofcourse all on the horizon !!!! https://t.co/K0ZpdiXkOT
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 But doing “better” is subjective. I don’t look at the people you named and feel like they are better than me lol I love them and I’m friends with many of them but I don’t compare myself that way. Music is subjective! Popularity depends on the crowd.
Hahahahaha girl shrooms are a mf. One time my friend told me she looked in the mirror and her eyes were gone it was just lights shining through 😳😳😳 https://t.co/RR7EBenGF2
I believe in them in saying I know people and have seen people in them and enjoying them. So yes I believe they work for some. https://t.co/ar5KN7jdnu
@3Thais3 @KehlaniToOhio https://t.co/p4PKmEdbtP
Those scare me. Never tried any, many of my friends have and their stories scare me gurrr https://t.co/NyAN2OpfZU
@lydiacoee @SammieMercury Right u just gotta watch ya self.
Right I think it’s about balance. Balance is everything I’ve learned. https://t.co/Z6xR4sIDw8
Hahaha yes what about it?? Do u like it or ?? https://t.co/vj13v4ibsY
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 In general when you are not what corporate America deems as “perfect” things are harder hahaha. Being an individual alone can make things harder lol.
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 And in terms of my music or anyone’s music it’s based on personal choice. You don’t have to like it but there are many very very successful musicians successful that everyone doesn’t like lol u know it’s all preference.
@KehlaniToOhio @3Thais3 But she’s not saying colorism means EVERY DARK SKINNED PERSON WILL BE HELD BACK, lol. Ofcourse people overcome their obstacles, she’s just stating that colorism can make things harder that it is for the other. I think that’s a fair assessment.
@AceBands_ People put pressure on themselves when it comes to their identity and I don’t think you have to put a lid on who you are, we are constantly evolving.
@AceBands_ Right uncertainty is not attractive in general but if someone likes both sexes that doesn’t have to make them feel uncertain. As long as you are certain about who you want to be with in whichever moment then you’re good I think.
@imgionni Yes! I love the show! I love the dynamics they bring to the surface forsureee
Yes I think in general in our community we tend to put a lot of harsh judgment on one another and I think it comes from our history in America. https://t.co/Lfdh5Y38p6
@thinnchrispy Hahaha oh yes okay gotcha!
Rather be seen as what? https://t.co/TYZU0v7Zko
YES! And sometimes I can overthink stuff and have to reel it tf back in hahahahah https://t.co/rR4AK4Pj4P
Absolutely. I think a lot of times for young folks it begins as a dissociative act because when we are young it’s hard to understand what we are really doing beyond “It feels cool” the intimacy part to me comes with maturity https://t.co/6XXmds6qaE
@imgionni Yet he still was attracted to her as well and wanted to sleep with her and everything! She just shut him down but if he was thinking about another woman she would’ve probably started competing!
@imgionni I was like wow what a great opportunity to have this discussion and the way she handled it, though maybe accurate in most cases, truly disappointed me because he hadn’t even acted on anything and he was already “gay” in her eyes.
Yes I would. I don’t see nothing really crazy about it, long as they not a cheater haha. https://t.co/KWK3PDEKYD
@AceBands_ Right! It’s hard for me to share when it comes to matters of the heart.
Haha did it say anything that you felt applied to you? https://t.co/NOx6wCPQMi
@3Thais3 I love you always boo 😭😫
Right it becomes a catch 22 for men. I honestly think masculinity and femininity are in both male and female and not decided on what’s between their legs. I think I’m very masculine at times. https://t.co/UYgPIAH11V
@AceBands_ No, I wouldn’t do a threesome with someone I love because it would make me uncomfortable for sure but that’s me and a lot of people feel like it’s not that deep.
Thank you so much sis and you know I’ll never stop. I focus on who does support me and that’s what inspires me !!!! https://t.co/3SyfBiFjdm
I did the numerology calculator! https://t.co/6fXtw6LKoa
I wish I had these answers girl https://t.co/2JIq118Jog
Hey boo!! Uhm I think this is an individual question meaning it depends on the couple! For some people they think a man having a mistress helps their relationship. Relationships have to be designed for each individual https://t.co/xRowy51SXK
Girl yes I’m a 11!!! https://t.co/TlWX4DF6tt
@thinnchrispy ??
Right. I saw this on greenleaf the show. The wife immediately became unattracted to him because he admitted to having feelings for men and that just hurt my soul because she rejected his honesty and vulnerability https://t.co/uOrJArJi8u
Right which I think is so completely unfair! Men have the same opportunity to define their sexual identity without being labeled one thing. Not fair to them at all. I’d date a bisexual man no problem and I think I have Hahahaha https://t.co/5bxTAcPMHV
Yes it’s is! I think because of my background as a child entertainer people try to box me. So they kind of look too deeply into the things I do, they can take them out of context and miss the point but not my true supporters! https://t.co/9pBtREejiY
Girl I love conspiracies hahaha https://t.co/QTo9gNoAQp
True but I think the reality is people speak out on what connects to only them. Which is fair because you don’t want someone speaking on your behalf that doesn’t understand your struggle https://t.co/1Ip8n6Yjho
Nothing at all!! We on the same page, my point is just that. I’m saying you gotta be out there touching the people esp when it comes to music and from there the energy travels https://t.co/q79qfXxkd0
I think some guys aren’t DL I think a lot of times they’re Bi, or just fluid and maybe don’t wanna tell women because women will judge them. Even though you should be honest I kind of understand that dilemma https://t.co/Ko1n8EFljC
Expand on this https://t.co/9ZBe8F693Q
I think it’s about starting with what u love https://t.co/VWQszMVVQF
It’s not. And I wonder how we can feel more empowered so we want to be involved https://t.co/SrmpOKfFQt
Hahahaha WHAT!? https://t.co/3YX53iBlWc
@3Thais3 A lot of times it’s about money and how much control you’re willing to give away to gain a certain platform. The music industry is a wild place.
@3Thais3 I just care about catering to my audience.
Thanks girl! I think it’s all about perception and I personally want to put more focus on touring. I think for me that’s something I need more emphasis in otherwise the people that do love my music can’t even experience it. Idc about the charts if I’m being honest https://t.co/BrLEamKM51
Yea I hate that a lot. I feel like women are supposed to be so sexually oppressed but we deserve the right to experience just as much as they do IF we want to. Men often try to control our bodies it’s quite patriarchal https://t.co/1DdgceheZ2
Yes and it’s like idk what to say or do about it. That’s with the government stuff in general rn it’s like how can we change It. I think the constitution needs to be updated honestly https://t.co/xbq7bLjCC8
@High_iM_Paul Hahaha right?? Cause he sung do comedy act I mean it’s too much but everything I need hahaha I wanna do stand up one day I started jotting stuff down the other day!

I’m watching this show and the judge said 400 yrs is the sentencing lol. He could’ve said life because I mean, dude ain’t gon’ live to see 200, let alone 400 🙃
@_ForeverKei Seriously girl. He’s the one broke and unemployed that’s why he’s hating on me. I’m doing the booked and paid dance.

@EmiloeC But every man is not a leader. That doesn’t mean he isn’t a man. Everyone in life is not a chief but that doesn’t mean their role isn’t just as valuable.

Following a good woman’s direction is actually extremely smart because God gave women a gift that he fid not give men. That’s our intuition and our natural ability to nurture.
A little taste of what my character April Lewis has been getting into this season on @BerlinStation. Watch new episodes, Sunday’s at 9/8c on @EPIXHD. #BerlinStation https://t.co/xzO9kwk8SU
In my opinion women innately are the brains while men are innately the bones. They carry out the deed with the right woman’s direction. 🤷🏾‍♀️
It’s crazy how fragile some men’s masculinity is. Listening to your woman means you about to be happy asf. Listen to her ass and have good life. Tf

@OnTheLoose4NJH No u not stupid girllll
You can complain without making a change only so many times before I believe you just want more attention.
Right !!!! Like I understand having a down time cause trust me I’ve been there but to constantly be helpless is not attractive to me in romance or friendships. https://t.co/OPXA1zSSgU

Real love is sometimes telling a mf to toughen up cause life is not serious enough for you to escape through manipulative victimization techniques. https://t.co/WYEWdalNac

I’m trying so hard to find a co-ed spa rn. Why they don’t want me to win?
I can not date someone that’s constantly being a victim. Pitying you is not a form of love but just a way for the “pitied” to control a compassionate heart.
@Love_Latrina I love you!

Being so reactionary through the internet at this point is almost superficial. Instead of trying to prove what we are we should just be what we are and if anyone wants to get to know you past the SURFACE of your pages that’s up to you.
People don’t always react through social media, and you can’t make people react through social media with assumptions.
People have to stop assuming people’s thoughts, feelings and opinions based off of likes or no likes or following or not following.

*Afternoon 🤫 https://t.co/xODEU7aBYZ
Good morning all. I’m sure y’all looking fine asf today 👅 what’s on the schedule?
Trust me I understand but the reality is sis when u hold on so tight nothing bad OR GOOD can get it 😓 https://t.co/JSXbW1hnxP
Bad experiences I think they create apprehension https://t.co/YRMhFvkzg9
@NettaBrielle I’m glad girl I’m talking to myself lol
Then at the same time being alone is really just a cop out to learning how to correctly deal with anxious thoughts. Instead of learning to calm yourself you just succumb to the disorder entirely. ALL BAD!
I’m getting better but committing to relationships of any kind has gotten so difficult for me as I have gotten older. Sometimes being alone seems so much easier because you’re the only one in control.
But you don’t want your anxiety to have you alone. I have made myself isolated so many times trying to avoid normal stuff lol I had to tell myself that you either gon’ live and love or not and I’d rather to than to not.
Dealing with anxiety is a mf cause the reality is everyone will hurt you somehow. So when the anxiety creeps in it’s hard to invalidate it because people with fck up! Period
I just thought about someone today like.. I wonder how they are, loving them from afar. Wondering if they realize I disappeared just because of my anxiety.
When I love people I love them... but the moment something goes wrong I question the entire friendship. I’ve ghosted folks completely without notice because of the anxiety of not being sure if they are really down for me lol.

When you find someone you feel love for. I think the action is expressed by respect for one another’s boundaries and or respectfully walking away even if the situation is not for you.
Love looks different for everyone. This is why it’s so important to define love on your own terms. We can miss love sometimes expecting it to be the way we have seen with our parents or the movies.

#BetterToHaveLoved lyric video is now live on https://t.co/trkW618gGx https://t.co/MAAZOa5PZt
“You and me I think we’re something special. Been connected soul and mind. This ain’t even sexual.”  https://t.co/H7PwrXe8B3 https://t.co/wJiYLkjoKS
This is the same with family and no love is greater than the other that’s the beauty. There are several different kinds that I think we all deserve to have because they enrich our lives in totally different ways. They also help us to evolve as individuals I believe.
It can be a best friend that you have never been physical with and would never even sexualize, yet you feel closer to them than you ever have with people you have actually been physical with.
Sometimes you can have a love so deep for someone that it defies the boundary line of platonic or romantic.

Remember this night 🤔 https://t.co/21dELpU0Yc
For some people that’s enough. To have others believe they’re good rather than trying their actual best.  And they prey on those that have the innocence they so desire.
People will be scandalous and act innocent like they can potentially win an Oscar. The moment you see them as they truly are they drop the the front. It’s like they only got off on you believing they were better than they actually were.
Folks be talking about loyalty and don’t even be loyal to themselves. Wondering why people don’t take them seriously and it’s because they don’t take themselves seriously.
I’m so happy spending the holiday with my family. I am truly thankful to God for the blessing of having people that love me for me.
@ps_imKY So are you 😍
😍😍😍
They try to covet what you have thinking it’ll make them you. Like issa competition, likes there’s room for two. But see this is why you slippin’ and I’m two for two, you can’t share my lane just make one for you 👸🏾 https://t.co/sHrSk7xWN8
Tears, sex nor money can make someone wanna be down for you. All those things are often used as tools to control &amp; may even work temporarily but true chemistry is defined by a person making their choice &amp; you respecting it.
@Swaggy_B_2 I love you back pooh
@makaylaalley Same energy 👀
Never would I spend my attention or time with anyone that didn’t actively express they were happy to have it. Boss thoughts.
There’s everything right about gassing the person you like. You’re special right? So then ofcourse the person you like is just as special because you like them.
People overthink the “thirsty” concept and end up coming across nonchalant asf and that is not attractive.
Guys be so focused on not seeming like “fans” that they come off as jerks. You supposed to fan over a girl you like, whether she’s “popular” or not.
Right https://t.co/Hb6pKlrZYq

“It’s not about likes on Twitter” was my cue. But I feel you. Just know as a follower of mine that I’m an advocate for mental health which is why people pretending online is so counterproductive in bringing awareness. https://t.co/UAecTultey
But many do dear and that’s who we are talking about lol. We are talking about the trendy people that lie for likes. That’s why he said, stop doing things for likes. So if you don’t do things for likes ... it don’t apply to you https://t.co/xkQ24zh7wv
Trust me. I know. Therapy is where it’s at because the Internet is most usually insensitive. You ever tried that? Insurance covers it ... https://t.co/LVrr1CZrbE
I meant. Leggoooo https://t.co/QLlUXs9MLe
Kevo :) https://t.co/QLlUXs9MLe
Right. That’s the thing that annoys me because desensitizes everyone. https://t.co/X1dmdKm48S
I believe that’s why that happens. There are many charlatans on the Internet. Many. Those that are going through things, prayers out to them to take it off the internet and into a therapy room. I love therapy. https://t.co/iW82juzRId
It’s like, God always has me right, I know that. But that doesn’t mean if a car is about to hit me I won’t move out the way ... you know?
There is so much balance that’s necessary in life. So much crazy stuff goes on and you can’t do anything about it ALL but at the same time you can’t sit still when things matter to you.
Why? People can be honest about how they feel.. but sometimes folks do things for the likes. https://t.co/jyLz36yr7g

I️ Love YOUUUU https://t.co/sgWSPV6pdE
You may have no one. Not a momma, daddy, sister, brother or friends. But you will always have YOU as long as you live.
I️ just hate when people are hurt, but people are hurting everyday. I️ wish for them to see they’re not alone, no matter how bad it feels.
#lilbootiesmatter
Having a “big” booty would be a little fun when I wanted to gag somebody w/ a twerk. But for the most part, I love my small butt 😍
I️ do a lot of things to secure the 💰 but sacrificing my dignity ain’t one.
People be really putting more emphasis on money than respect. I️ rather you be broke working towards something than a rich asshole.
@AustinVesely I️ could be 🤔
@MoonQueen333 I️ love you baby 💋
I️ could only say something like this to the Lord tbh 🤷🏾‍♀️🙌🏾 https://t.co/gXF30aONBW

I️ miss you!!! Hope we have some more scenes soon 🙏🏾 https://t.co/Kj2vH22v1V
@xXjaviiXx @jaysharah Totally. For me it generally takes time to know. Hence why I️ flirt. To gauge my interest through the banter.
@djlukenastyy Hahahaha heeeeey
Damn. That’s so true sis. I️ believe that plays a major part. https://t.co/aeXRGXFFUG
Hahahahahaha awww 🤦🏾‍♀️😂 https://t.co/cNJqj23ONn
I️ think we are never alone, so yes ofcourse. https://t.co/QxvXvp8A0Q
Building is so important. I️ find the pseudo relationship ships make that pretty difficult. It becomes possessive. https://t.co/6TatzxBg7c
Hahaha. No lying involved. It’s easy to tell someone you don’t want to take it any further or u do. I️ mean it’s easy for me. https://t.co/rdA6SHuo5N
Even when y’all aren’t ready? https://t.co/VoxqWYy6Xo

Reason? https://t.co/OZyYManZcz
Flirting is so fun. Would y’all agree?
I️ didn’t even use emojis. Wtf this iPhone update is weiiiiirrrrdddd bro https://t.co/ToF8l4hE4a

Apologizing simply means you care about the person involved enough to take responsibility for any confusion that transpired.

@memyselfandshyy Aw man girl. I'm glad that I could be of service to you. But everything you need, is inside of you!
@memyselfandshyy So are you! Clearly 😍😍😍
@memyselfandshyy Some just practice things that make it easier. Gotta stop being hard on yourself 😍
@memyselfandshyy same things. Trust me.
@memyselfandshyy Society makes you believe one thing and then when you can not be that it makes you feel like you are broken. Everyone is dealing with the
@memyselfandshyy *experience.
@memyselfandshyy Prayer, yoga and creativity and accepting the fact that it's not normal for a mind to be quiet. The practice is accepting that is the human
@youngthugsister Thank you pooh pooh
@memyselfandshyy I am normal. I just philosophy human emotions.
@memyselfandshyy The pain in my voice is the pain in everyone's voice because everyone experience pain lol. People just don't expect me to I guess.
@memyselfandshyy I'm very regular I just talk about stuff very analytically. If you spoke to me it would seem a lot less dramatic than what you may think.
@memyselfandshyy I'm super normal 😇

God be WITH YOU! I don't have all the answers and I don't declare to. But I know this much is true: God loves me and also loves you!!!!!!!! https://t.co/CWEBCosouW
We have to forgive what has been done to us, our families, our ancestors to be able to share the light we are meant to share. https://t.co/MMqwQM97Ww
You will experience hardships and it will be so very hard. We all face them. But FORGIVENESS and LOVE will ALWAYS set you FREE. https://t.co/AlCeT99j0c
We have to have faith that by loving and FORGIVING, we too will get what we deserve when it is all said and done. PEACE. https://t.co/8ro1M3jQQg
A practice to remind us that this is not the last stop for the spirit. We have to have faith beyond our pride and ego. https://t.co/idApT60kHP
It's so hard as a human not to get down about what you feel you deserve. It's very HUMAN, but detachment is a practice. https://t.co/eEojlCrLrq
Jesus didn't get what he was "owed" until he shed his material BODY. He did not fret what was of this world cause he knew he was not OF it. https://t.co/7uFdimpRwi
He got nothing of what he was "owed" for his spiritual beauty. No, it was quite the contrary. https://t.co/7uFdimpRwi
As he was being beaten and strung up he wasn't shouting "I hate y'all! You gon' pay" no, he was crying, for their ignorance. https://t.co/S1ttxSjIFH
This is why I love the story of Jesus, because it so well displays how a beautiful soul can be horribly mistreated on earth. https://t.co/itVDXJnjBI
You gotta stop waiting to get what you're owed. You're never ever ever ever going to get it especially in a materially dominated world.
Ayeeee thanks sis 😍😘 https://t.co/esGdlp9905

I always have hated that he was gone but seeing the movie put me in the complete mood of mourning his death.
Genuinely in my heart I'm so sad we can't see him in his 40's and see how much more he accomplished.
I just now was able to see All Eyez On Me in Berlin and I'm dead ass balling. I'm so sad Tupac is not here any longer.

Don't. It's about breaking people down so they don't become as great as you. #BurningSands https://t.co/N3ci9QqS3W
Omg. I have got to do something to get my mind off of this. I hate when movies affect me this deeply. 😢
Nothing in life is worth your LIFE. NOTHING. #BurningSands
I am truly so sad omg. I hated how they did that to this boy. Omg. For what? Recommendations? Family tradition? #BurningSands
I appreciate the parallels they made to slavery and it's historical influence on black relations. #BurningSands
I'm literally depressed beyond belief. I don't understand how beating the shit out of someone equates to love. #BurningSands
Crying my eyes out rn from this movie. The things people do to be accepted and apart of something. I don't understand hazing. #BurningSands
@Dzayrozay10 👀
I stg @trevorjackson5 if you die in this movie, I'm gonna be depressed for weeks. Omg #BurningSands
I'm surprised that no one hasn't ever gone into a revengeful homicidal break if experiencing THIS level of hazing 🤦🏾‍♀️ #BurningSands
See the problem here is, if I stayed around long enough to get my behind beat with a paddle .. I'd commit murder in the end. #BurningSands
I'm watching Burning Sands and I'm super nervous it's gonna make me cry. I can just feel a sorrowful ending. 😓

I will never understand how a person stuck in their pride chooses to live, because a "win" for them is a deafening loss, to me. 🤷🏾‍♀️ https://t.co/tKolwQzjXZ

I smile when people see my forgiveness as a weakness, that's when I then not only forgive them again, but PRAY for them as well. 😍 https://t.co/Zo4cmWqeEZ
Those that gain superiority over others remorse are not only miserable w/ pride, but GUILTY asf. https://t.co/R5XUdK65KF

@Jeauxsims Love you!!!
And even if they aren't "used" for this, this is what they do because the display of characters are limited to a few "types". https://t.co/1nvlwMMSkr
Our life experiences shape who we are and instead of looking at them as bad when we see different, we should smile at the beauty of God. https://t.co/rXnx5QdKIc
Sometimes I fall short but I know the truth, which is that we are just supposed to love one another and have an open mind. https://t.co/MS1CezBbdk
I work everyday to not fall into the trap of labeling myself and others. It's hard, but it is FREEDOM.
We force people into boxes and it's simply unfair. Stop trying to figure out why people are different and LOVE them for it. https://t.co/WgHZ1AdL82
We have to fight the idea that certain characteristics mean THIS REALITY for this KIND of person. https://t.co/pY0f4JPB4c
Some girls are more masculine than guys(ME!), some guys are more flamboyant than girls. I have learned this means nothing!
You gon miss out on love and happiness not accepting someone cause you ain't seen "them" on TV. Cause the gag is it's all bullshit.
Labels aren't real. They are just societal ideals. Film and media archetypes used to create confusion, deny unity and individuality.
And if other people look at your past as a way to invalidate the sincerity of your evolution(a), plainly said, FUCK THEM!!!!!!! https://t.co/jEoeVYNzbP
You don't need any other label than your desired NAME to define who you are. 💯 https://t.co/AkeOOgiFNf
I don't believe in labeling because it's the labeling that creates a self prison. Date who you wanna date, be who YOU wanna be. https://t.co/LjL36zUkR5
Just like in heterosexual relations people break up, it's the same for everything else no matter if it's same sex or otherwise. https://t.co/z1WOge0R2r
A man dates a man for years and then turns around and dates a woman and he's "fooling himself" BULLSHIT. https://t.co/9H6hv5j6yj
People change every day B. You can date a woman for ten years and turn around and marry a man and u are seen as "fixed" BULLSHIT. https://t.co/Mp0EA4cdCY
There is much group think that plagues our world and I truly wish the double standards and judgments could come to a holt. https://t.co/v7XBSxMiIB
This is truly unfair and can truly stifle a persons growth and their building of their own IDENTITY. Which should be UNIQUE. https://t.co/gOqQZppswG
Human sexuality is built on a spectrum. I hate that when a man has relations with another man society then says he can not date a woman.

@L_Bailey99 But I had to learn boundaries otherwise I would over extend. Caused me much heartache.
Major trigger for me since childhood, growing up in poverty etc. it's actually the main source of my creativity. To bring others joy. https://t.co/KoJTsMWlLj
If you tend to be a people pleaser, stay away from people that allow themselves to be miserable, they are triggering you.
Ahhh 😍 https://t.co/jljDOQb28u

Ultimate! Very observant gal. https://t.co/V7yWEdEu4x
@loverynnxo_ Sad but true and it's hard for me to accept when everyone has the same opportunity to be great. Just different challenges getting there.
Then, one is not only duplicitous, but also a coward.
Duplicitous nature truly intrigues me because it sits at the core of one truly knowing right from wrong and still choosing wrong.
I have never understood wolf in sheeps clothing. If you are in actuality a wolf, why be ashamed? Why pretend to be a sheep? Why not own it?
Out NOW!!! https://t.co/EQ0uzuVY8A

I saw some niggas pushing my shit to the side earlier before I moved it and here they were again tryna smuggle my shit into a pile https://t.co/99vLAH6qhS
Realizing I left my bag unwatched when I was running around chasing Tommy. https://t.co/MTPHsRB5ry
He's basically like threatening me!! Then I realize none of this is safe and that I have to leave so I get my friends and my stuff. https://t.co/VKfaPEhbVN
I slightly do scream in the little girls ear cause she was meddling. Next thing you know her daddy coming out the kitchen https://t.co/87TDASNoWV
I'm talking to my friend as this man's little girl daughter interrupts the conversation I'm having with my grown friend .. https://t.co/FVL2ahKJdO
I turn back to Tommy and he's gone https://t.co/nazSbVc3Zv

We ran all through the house and once I almost got to him I see what appears to be his LADY come around the corner laughing at me https://t.co/DWlrg65X6C
But his looked half empty and as I reached to just examine it he starts running from me! https://t.co/SgGsCU6iwf
Tommy then pulls out his cologne comparing! I'm like no wtf this is some different shit this is mine not even the same ... https://t.co/t3eH1zPWcs
Similar to the one I got Tommy before. Tommy sees me showing him the cologne like I'm gifting it to the friend and he goes off https://t.co/ixDCOEB4mr
He pulled out 500$. As I was taking out my stuff he was looking in my purse for other stuff he might want and saw some cologne ....
One of his friends started asking me if I'd sell him my purse and I was down with it cause it was my flee market coach back ... https://t.co/ifJrhq0Nw5

Girls do y'all experience getting figuratively poked by guys? Like where they want nothing but for you to acknowledge their existence?

@iam__jessica What do u think of it?
@iam__jessica That saddens me
Let the light of the Lord shine so brightly within in you that it blinds the soulless out the sea of contentment.
"They don't realize the light is so bright because the glory of God residing within. That's why they can only take it in doses!"
