The Trump administration just finalized a new rule to cut off federal funding to any group that provides abortion services. It’s a direct attack on women’s reproductive rights. We are going to do everything we can to stop it. #NoGagRule
16 states, including CO, have now joined forces in a lawsuit to block Trump’s fake emergency and prevent him from spending billions of dollars on an unnecessary wall. Proud that @GovofCO and @COAttnyGeneral are doing their part to help us stop this abuse of power.
The president’s decision today, to declare a fake national emergency just so he can take money away from other important projects and spend it on his wall, is beyond the pale – and, I believe, an abuse of power. #FakeTrumpEmergency
One year ago today we all watched the horrific images coming out of Parkland, FL. Such a tragedy never should have happened – not in Parkland, not in Columbine, not in Aurora, not in Newtown, not anywhere. Congress must act. We need to get these assault weapons off our streets.
Great to meet with @lockheedmartin employees and the many local Colorado suppliers who are building the @NASA_Orion spacecraft that will carry our American astronauts to the moon, mars and beyond! https://t.co/t4mRpeYlNg
The FDA has recalled at least 15 drugs used to treat high blood pressure because they contained known carcinogens. The drugs were all made in either China or India. Today, I’m demanding answers. Here’s the letter I just sent to the head of the FDA: https://t.co/9aHIq3ADwc
I just introduced a bill to make permanent a program that lets 4th grade kids and their families visit our national parks for free. Children are our future and this bill will ensure every kid has an opportunity to experience all the beauty and wonder that our parks have to offer.
Another hearing, another panel, another unanimous verdict!  At this morning’s panel on public lands, I asked every witness there one simple question: Is climate change real and is it something we need to urgently address? Every one of them answered, “yes!” https://t.co/TqoveBT74E
There is no legitimate reason for anyone, other than law enforcement, to need a semi-automatic assault rifle with a high-capacity magazine. Today, @RepTedDeutch and I introduced legislation to ban high-capacity magazines that hold more than ten rounds. #EnoughIsEnough
The FDA approved a new drug, Dsuvia, that’s 10x more powerful than fentanyl and 1,000x more powerful than morphine. So, as we try to combat our nation’s opioid epidemic, the FDA is approving new drugs that will make it worse? We want to know why: https://t.co/h6DD1lQ8g9
Heading to Dearborn, Michigan to say goodbye to one of our nation’s most dedicated public servants. My mentor and friend, @JohnDingell
Elvin R. Caldwell was a trailblazer and community leader who helped tackle discrimination across our state. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/YcZY9P7gt2
Check out my e-newsletter recapping some of this week's important developments, including our first oversight hearing this week on Trump’s family-separation policy. https://t.co/Z4uDoEsOBi
Pleased about the court's ruling on this important case. But it also serves as a reminder that our fight against draconian restrictions on abortion rights is still far from over – and why it's so important that we stay united in our efforts to protect reproductive rights. https://t.co/XEVAvJJGze
John Dingell was a towering figure in Congress. He was a master legislator, known for his tireless preparation, good humor and dedication to public service and oversight. I was lucky to call John Dingell my mentor, and even luckier to call him my friend. He'll be forever missed. https://t.co/MjrgcQPD67
Just finished talking to @JoyAnnReid about our committee’s first oversight hearing today on President #Trump's cruel family separation policy and the harm it's caused thousands of children. Watch here: https://t.co/Wd0AnAs2xl
Tune in to @MSNBC tonight at 6:20 pm MT/ 8:20 pm ET, where I'll be talking with @JoyAnnReid about what we learned today at our hearing on President #Trump's shameful family separation policy.
There is no evidence that HHS leaders ever tried to stop the administration’s abhorrent family separation policy. As the agency dedicated to the health and welfare of children, we need to know why. Here’s what I told them today: https://t.co/e5jnTd9qAn
In case you missed it, check out my interview on @Maddow about my Oversight hearing today on Trump’s Family Separation Policy. https://t.co/DKAKRMBmhg
Tune into @maddow at 7:30 pm MT/9:30 pm ET tonight. I'll be talking about tomorrow’s much-anticipated oversight hearing on the president's shameful policy of separating families at the border.
It’s unanimous! At the first @EnergyCommerce hearing on #ClimateChange in years, every single witness agreed: Climate Change is real and humans contribute to it. This is an important step in our effort to ensure science and facts guide environmental policy making. Watch: https://t.co/LU4mAmvTox
Last night, Trump said he wants Congress to stop its "ridiculous" investigations of his administration. Sorry, Mr. President, as chair of the E&amp;C Oversight panel I can tell you: We're just getting started. Our first hearing is tomorrow on your shameful child-separation policy.
Here’s my full statement on the president’s speech: https://t.co/B2IUHGCPnZ
If Trump wants to work with us to find real solutions to our nation’s most pressing issues, then we are ready to work with him. But if he’s going to continue to deny climate change, roll back environmental regs and eliminate the ACA, then he’s going to have a fight on his hands
What we heard tonight was classic state-of-the-union Trump, who tells everybody what they want to hear. Unfortunately, what we are forced to live with every other day is a president whose actions are doing real harm to our country.
Yesterday, I met with this amazing group of women Muslim leaders who, despite facing discrimination, are continuing to pursue the American dream. They are inspiring, and we had a good discussion about why we must stop the president’s #travelban. https://t.co/OMpPWsdmwu
Tomorrow, two House committees – the Natural Resources Committee and @EnergyCommerce – are holding the first Congressional hearings on Climate Change since Trump took office. These hearings will end years of GOP neglect &amp; denial on the issue, and I will be participating in both. https://t.co/QjpwjJEBx9
During #BlackHistoryMonth , I'll be sharing facts about Colorado's black history, which has played a pivotal role in shaping our state and the western values we hold dear. There's so much to remember and celebrate this month and year round. https://t.co/DFwpRghjje
Was great meeting with volunteers from @VOAColorado’s Foster Grandparent Program at Denver's Place Bridge Academy today. Ms. Ollie Morris, pictured here, has fostered 4th &amp; 5th grade students with special needs for 28 years. She’s an inspiring example of compassion &amp; service! https://t.co/LRNQQOrL8Y
Just wrote to the head of the @DeptofDefense urging him not to implement #Trump's proposed ban on #transgender servicemembers, despite the Court’s decision to allow implementation. This baseless policy won't make our country safer, it’s just more bigotry. https://t.co/QmjhBoIzOF
There were more than 26 billion robocalls placed in the U.S. last year – up 46% from the year before! We have to do more to stop these unwanted calls. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor legislation today to give @FCC the power it needs to crack down on these annoying calls. https://t.co/bUK4KVMgeZ
Jonathan White, who wrote this recent report on behalf of the administration, will be appearing before my committee next week. I would suggest he come prepared to answer some very direct questions.
These aren’t just numbers on a page, or names on a list - these are real kids, with real families, who are scared to death.
The fact that the Trump administration hasn’t even ‘tried to determine the total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities’ is inexcusable.
Check out my e-newsletter recapping some of this week's important developments, including my work on @EnergyCommerce to get more information about the President's #FamilySeparation policy and the rising cost of #insulin. https://t.co/3rOKcoeAzx
Today, we kick off #BlackHistoryMonth. While the legacy of African Americans in Colorado and across America should be celebrated year-round, I hope you’ll especially join us this month to take time to reflect on some of the most significant contributions made through our history. https://t.co/FgkVVcuixT
I met yesterday with community leaders to discuss proposed changes to the so-called public charge rule. If approved, these changes would prevent many immigrants from getting the public assistance they need – and that’s why I sent a letter to @DHSgov opposing these changes. https://t.co/56Z9PC94qP
I had a great discussion with a group of #climatechange activists in our community on Thursday. As chair of the @EnergyCommerce oversight panel, shining a light on the #Trump administration's failure to properly tackle climate change is one of my top priorities. https://t.co/6JQAHMKtto
Our first oversight hearing on President Trump’s shameful family separation policy will be next Thursday, Feb. 7. Despite the public outrage, the previous Republican majority did nothing to hold the administration accountable. That ends next week. https://t.co/3ozLU0LeQT
I'm honored to carry on the dedicated work of women leaders who came before me in getting this amendment ratified. We still need the #ERANow.
Both offer new opportunities to protect women from unfair and unjust discrimination. Though we've made strides, we still need an amendment to enshrine the rights we deserve.
That's why I have signed on to two resolutions -- one that would repeal the expired deadline for the original ERA, and another that creates a modified version of the ERA that explicitly guarantees equal rights for men and women.
The push to ratify the #EqualRightsAmendment (ERA) was a bold effort to expand women's rights across America. But sadly, it wasn't ratified in time by enough states to become law of the land. 37 years after it missed the mark, its protections are still needed.
Great meeting w/ @nfbco members, as well as these two amazing students, Deyannira Villa Cazares of Denver and Ian Lee of Aurora, who are on Capitol Hill today to help increase access to technology for the visually impaired, which is a critical goal for so many fellow Coloradans. https://t.co/IUrNRK1UjC
I’m proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats today as a sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure men and women receive equal pay for equal work. Progress in achieving this goal is still too slow, and we need to take bold action by passing this bill. https://t.co/k39ubRYADm
We just sent letters to drug makers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, demanding to know why the price of insulin continues to skyrocket. This is a lifesaving drug that millions of Americans rely on – we can’t let its cost put it out of reach.   https://t.co/DUm5MsUgG6 https://t.co/dahEkrcHFp
It’s been 10 years since Pres. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was a monumental step towards ensuring equal pay, but we still have a lot of work to do. I’m proud to continue to be working to close this unacceptable pay gap once and for all. https://t.co/lB5UxZSfbj
#Trump's @EPA is trying to roll back our nation’s air quality standards to help big corporations make more money, while putting our health at risk. That’s not right. And that's why I am working with my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to hold them accountable. https://t.co/lFQ0vtUBNl
Just sent a letter to the head of @EPA demanding info about the Trump administration’s plan to roll back air-quality standards. We’re not going to sit back and let this administration put Americans’ health at risk just so companies can make more money. https://t.co/3XBRk5hFiY
New @USCBO report shows the #shutdown caused $3 billion in permanent damage to our economy. But no number can quantify the suffering it caused to so many hardworking families. For the sake of our country and economy, we must never allow another crisis like this to happen again. https://t.co/FXrdj47RNU
The effects of this awful #shutdown will be felt long after our government is reopened, especially for federal employees and contractors living paycheck to paycheck. Financial institutions need to show patience, and we must work to ensure they all receive the pay they’re due.
Check out my latest e-newsletter recapping some of this week’s important developments, including the agreement just reached to reopen the federal government. https://t.co/hHKkDsgl8B
This government shutdown should never have happened. We need to work quickly to get the government reopened and ensure every federal worker is paid the money they are due. Then we need to work to make sure another crisis like this never happens again. https://t.co/otoUFZuL43
Excited to announce that in addition to serving on @EnergyCommerce this Congress, I'll also serve on the House Natural Resources Committee. This gives us a great opportunity to keep working to protect CO’s environment &amp; public lands for future generations. https://t.co/D64uMas7CK https://t.co/vg5XOC8w5Y
Americans are hurting, Mr. President. Enough is enough. We need to end the shutdown now. Then, work with Congress to find real solutions to enhance our border security. Coloradans, and all Americans, deserve leadership - not a tantrum.
I support enhancing our border security, but we need to have a real conversation about it instead of this “my way or the highway” approach President Trump is stuck on.
The House has voted multiple times to reopen the government, but President #Trump and Senate Republicans refuse to end this shutdown. They are holding our government and economy hostage for a ridiculous wall. The American people deserve better. We need to end the #shutdown now.
This is a devastating blow in the fight for #equality. I've been working to oppose this unjust policy from the beginning, and, despite this setback, we won't quit now. This is about legitimizing #trans Americans' inherent value -- in our military and our society at large. https://t.co/iJgulKBRr7
As we recall both events this week, we're reminded that for every victory affirming and protecting our #reprorights, there is an effort to suppress them. With so much at stake, we can't let up the fight to defend women's health, and I'll lead the way. @ProChoiceCaucus #Roe46 https://t.co/f2wNtEaePl
Today is the 46th anniversary of the #RoevWade decision, establishing American women's constitutional right to choose. But tomorrow also marks two year's since President Trump reinstated the anti-choice Global Gag Rule, threatening that right for women around the world.
It was a joy to once again participate in Denver’s annual #Marade, where we came together to honor Dr. King’s enduring legacy. His spirit is alive and well in our community, and we must continue working to fully realize his ideals across America and around the world. #MLKDay https://t.co/i4qCb5exiR
Happy #MLKDay! As we honor this civil rights icon, let's also recommit ourselves to serving our community and advancing the fight for equality. We're not there yet, but we can get closer if we remain united by Dr. King’s timeless ideals. https://t.co/nD1gX4qIQ2
First and foremost, he needs to end this shutdown immediately and then work with Congress on smart and effective border security methods that work.
The president’s address shows he continues to have no problem using people’s lives and livelihoods as a bargaining chip for his dangerous agenda.
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including continuing my efforts to reopen the government, sharing my new leadership role on @EnergyCommerce, protecting our #ReproRights, and honoring the life and legacy of Dr. King ahead of #MLKDay. https://t.co/W1Wf8puxtG
Thanks to the @nytimes for its stunning profile of nearly every woman in the 116th Congress. It's in newsstands today, and the stunning spread masterfully visualizes the strength of our growing numbers. Republican and Democrat, we remain united by a powerful sisterhood. https://t.co/IEdEVvhOsP
"When DeGette assumes leadership of @EnergyCommerce's oversight and investigations panel, she pledged to use her gavel power to schedule #reprohealth hearings rooted in facts, not the anti-abortion fiction that the GOP-controlled committee previously enabled with taxpayer money." https://t.co/eEEC2OxeQJ
#GunViolence is one of the biggest public health crises facing our nation, and it's outrageous that our agencies aren't conducting more research on it. I've long supported this effort because it's an important step to saving lives. https://t.co/a6Z8RKSuXi
New @OIGatHHS report found there may have been thousands more children separated from their families at the border than previously reported – and that the real number may never be known. That’s unacceptable! My subcommittee is working hard to investigate. https://t.co/5CwI4Dc27U
We know the state of our union right now: It’s closed. @SpeakerPelosi is right to prevent Trump from giving a State of the Union address until after the government is re-opened. His first and only priority should be working with Congress to end this harmful #shutdown.
DeGette said the pro-choice majority in the House was historic. “I can’t tell you what this means for protecting the full range of women’s health,” said DeGette. “Not just here in the United States but around the world.” @ProChoiceCaucus https://t.co/6DMWbgPWO3
Today, one year later, I presided over the House floor and there wasn’t one anti-choice bill in sight. Elections have consequences! https://t.co/zczywkAycI
This time last year, I was fighting hard against a draconian, anti-choice bill House Republicans were pushing ahead of the March for Life. For at least the last 5 years, House Republicans voted on these types of bills ahead of the march.
I'm proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWage Act, which increases the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. As the ultra-rich get richer, working families have an increasingly tough time making ends meet; that's not right. it's time we ensure a livable wage for every American worker. https://t.co/ODA9dQ3RAH
Two gavels in two days? What a week! Tune in to @cspan beginning at noon ET (10 am MT)  to watch me preside over the House floor throughout the day, or stream it live here: https://t.co/vwNfsX17hi
From #Trump's tragic #FamilySeparation policy at the border, to #climatechange, to making health care more affordable, and more, our subcommittee has a lot to cover in this Congress. I'm honored to lead that effort on behalf of all Americans who rightfully demand good governance.
I’m pleased to announce that I’ve been named the chair of @EnergyCommerce’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Having the gavel on this important panel means greater power to investigate critical issues facing Americans and hold the #Trump administration accountable. https://t.co/vYrYuRtccK
Justice strikes again. #Trump's attempt to add a question about citizenship on next year's Census was nothing more than a thinly-veiled attempt to deny immigrant communities fair representation in Congress. We must continue to fight this dangerous effort. https://t.co/Sy8msHPb5Y

Stories like Mallory’s reveal the terrifying reality of this shutdown. Furloughed workers are facing life-or-death situations, just so @realDonaldTrump can try to force taxpayers to fund a border wall he promised Mexico would pay for. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/kbEth0RIRP
Excellent news. These rules from the #Trump administration were some of the most insidious in its ongoing effort to undermine women’s health. However, this is only a temporary reprieve, so we must keep fighting to protect #BirthControl coverage. https://t.co/AjnQYnaqDa
Heartbreaking. As Co-Chair of the Diabetes Caucus, I conducted an extensive inquiry into the causes of this price increase and found that we need to address issues across the supply chain. In the new Congress, we must keep working to implement solutions to this crisis. https://t.co/GgXob6rGAf
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including continuing to work to end this unacceptable shutdown, oppose Trump's wall, and advance priorities in the new Congress that benefit all Americans. https://t.co/gRv0uR8Bg9
At the border, I saw firsthand the people affected by our broken immigration system, including this woman trying to seek refuge in the U.S. It made a lasting impression on me. All I could think is that America is better than this. I hope President Trump realized that too. https://t.co/rF00uqD4hv
Our top priority right now must be to end this government shutdown and make sure all of our federal workers are fully compensated. As long as these workers aren’t getting paid, I won’t take my paycheck either.
I led more than 200 of my colleagues in calling on @SecAzar to rescind a Trump admin. rule that would make it harder for women to get an abortion by needlessly complicating the payment process -- another thinly veiled attempt to strip away our hard-fought #ReproRights. https://t.co/tfBh77pxEK

If #Trump doesn't end his #shutdown soon, millions of needy families could see drastic cuts to their food assistance benefits. I just sent a letter to @SecretarySonny demanding to know what the @USDA can do to continue helping these families in need. https://t.co/LnpLUnCeyl
More than 15,000 federal employees in our state are either working without pay or furloughed due to the #TrumpShutdown. Many will be watching the President's speech tonight, and they deserve to know why he thinks a wall is more important than their livelihoods. https://t.co/nEVHiylMqQ
This #TrumpShutdown is hurting more than just federal workers – it’s affecting our entire economy. New report shows every day #Trump keeps the government closed, America’s small businesses are paying the price. That’s not right. #EndTheShutdown today! https://t.co/Q7JJg11cku
Easy to say for a man who’s notorious for not paying people what he owes. No wonder he has little sympathy for working families who play by the rules. End this #TrumpShutdown! https://t.co/eaB4PFEPKi
Today marks the first full pay period missed by Federal employees affected by the #TrumpShutdown. That means missing prescription refills, grocery trips, child care, rent and more.

@PeteDominick @ProChoiceCaucus @RepBarbaraLee @SIRIUSXM Thanks for the kind words. I’d love to chat soon.
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including working to end the #TrumpShutdown as @HouseDemocrats take charge, take on unchecked special interests in our politics through #HR1 and encourage you to #GetCovered during #OpenEnrollment season. https://t.co/nExgg1MGdY
This morning, House Democratic women gathered for a photo to mark the beginning of the 116th Congress.

We have a lot to accomplish, but women know how to get the job done. https://t.co/QtwQN1Bnk6
800k civil servants are either furloughed or working without pay during the #shutdown that #Trump engineered over his pointless border wall. Now, his cronies are about to cash in? This is outrageous hypocrisy. He must end this stunt and reopen our gov't. https://t.co/1c2nbZSek4
I'm honored to cosponsor #HR1, The For the People Act of 2019, which institutes much-needed reforms to curb the toxic influence of big-moneyed special interests in our politics. Our Democracy succeeds when each voice matters more than any dollar. #ForThePeople https://t.co/jyv06I82GX

One of the biggest priorities of the 116th Congress will be stopping #Trump's relentless attacks on women's health. As @ProChoiceCaucus Co-Chairs, @RepBarbaraLee and I are prepared and excited to continue leading that charge. We must protect and expand #ReproRights. https://t.co/MFjlh6wMF5

Today is historic. A record number of women -- 102 in all -- will be sworn into the House of Reps. When I first came to Washington in 1997, there were less than 60 of us. For my colleagues and I, this growth is heartening but a long time coming. Let's keep up the momentum! https://t.co/iJcQ7geuml
It was a pleasure meeting @PPFA's new President, @DrLeanaWen, to discuss our shared goal of strengthening women's health.

So @POTUS, since you’re taking responsibility for this #shutdown, what do you have to say to the 800,000 federal employees who aren’t being paid during the holidays? @AFGENational https://t.co/G7LGjzwC2R
As we get closer and closer to a #TrumpShutdown, don’t forget who is responsible for it — and who has the power to prevent it before Americans are harmed. https://t.co/98Ns0hnm2r

As #Trump hurls America toward a government #shutdown, we can at least be grateful that, for now, #SCOTUS has blocked his scheme to shut down our border to those in need. I'll keep working to prevent both. https://t.co/CEdyiiP4Uo
It's shameful that #Trump is willing to shut down the gov't and furlough more than 800K employees during the holidays just to get his senseless and xenophobic border wall -- which I totally oppose. He must work with Dems to keep the gov't open and secure our borders efficiently. https://t.co/mPDgbPiVJy
Wishing Justice Ginsburg a speedy and easy recovery. I hope to see you back on the bench soon where your wisdom, intellect and commitment to the rule of law are needed now more than ever. https://t.co/Ed3qiDRy3T
Pleased the House overwhelmingly passed my bipartisan bill, H.R.7328, that streamlines how @US_FDA approves over-the-counter drugs.

While the horrific crimes of Larry Nassar against our Olympic athletes have captured the headlines, they are just one example of unchecked sexual abuse occurring in organized sports and countless other fields.
This is extremely troubling.

The Texas court ruling on the #ACA once again shows that Republicans will stop at nothing to destroy this law and rip away the health coverage it has provided for millions of Americans. We will use all tools at our disposal to make sure this decision does not stand.
It's not only sad, @SecNielsen, it's an outrage. Let's be clear -- this young girl's tragic death is the direct result of America's draconian policies at the border that put more people in these dangerous situations. Platitudes and condolences aren't enough. We need change. https://t.co/vt2dXfJRuN

Two years after 21st Century Cures was signed into law, I am amazed by the progress it has made in fighting diseases and improving public health. This bipartisan effort is saving lives, and we must work toward similar reforms in the new Congress. https://t.co/23Nfv80ELQ https://t.co/Catxp8F2pL
Tomorrow marks one year since @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. Over the past year, millions of Americans have voiced their support for restoring #NetNeutrality rules, and I'll continue fighting for the free and open internet. https://t.co/Uh6VwCjw3b
If true, this inexplicably heartless decision will endanger Vietnamese refugees who have lived in this country for decades and built new lives. I expressed my strong opposition to this proposal in a Sept. 2018 letter to @SecNielsen and will continue working to prevent this. https://t.co/S4OHQ7FozW
In the three years since the #ParisAgreement was adopted, #Trump has sold America's leadership on fighting #ClimateChange to the highest bidder, pulling us out of the initiative and gutting environmental safeguards. Still, we'll keep fighting for a cleaner future. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/V0zBLzA3wu
Today, @HouseCommerce held a hearing on access to SAFE kits, which help survivors of rape and sexual assault get the care they need &amp; preserve evidence for law enforcement. We need to ensure more people receive these exams, &amp; we must renew #VAWA, which can help achieve this goal. https://t.co/RmRm7qrRjp
My @ProChoiceCaucus Co-Chair, @RepBarbaraLee, and I are proud to author this letter opposing #Trump's cruel changes to the #PublicCharge rule that could rip away reproductive health care from many. This a right we must defend for every woman -- regardless of immigration status. https://t.co/nIRfXST6K9
.@HouseGOP needs to follow the Constitution, which clearly grants Congress the power to authorize military force. Instead, they are seeking to block @RepRoKhanna's resolution I've cosponsored that ends our unauthorized support for the war in Yemen. They should be ashamed. https://t.co/ngLameeNEE
By helping to bring biosimilar #insulin to market, @US_FDA has taken a huge step to achieve relief for people with #diabetes. Through my investigation into rising #insulin costs, I called for this action and commend @SGottliebFDA for his follow through. https://t.co/2Xvz4wyolL https://t.co/s9M3EGhOVz
Westerners understand the importance of access to clean water. That’s why I’ve consistently opposed efforts to limit Clean Water Act protections. This move will harm ecosystems, communities, and our economy, and I'll work to hold @EPA accountable for it. https://t.co/tqKHmNPL1f
Today the House unanimously passed H.R. 1318, my bipartisan bill with @HerreraBeutler that tackles the troubling rise of maternal mortality in the United States. Thanks to my House colleagues for recognizing the need for action on this public health crisis. Let's make it law. https://t.co/ZzGzAE03P4
I joined my fellow congressional Democrats from Colorado in sending a letter to @DHSgov opposing proposed changes to the #PublicCharge rule. If adopted, it would shut the door to the American dream for families across Colorado and around the world. https://t.co/BT0pVLNQYh https://t.co/CwLeI7QLZq
This is tragic. Not long ago, the U.S. was a global leader in the fight against #ClimateChange. Now, we are joining Russia and Saudi Arabia and opposing the rest of the world in understanding the urgent threats we face. https://t.co/qbORD3ltHQ
Pleased that the Supreme Court is declining to hear this case, which is part of the ongoing assault on women, low-income Americans and the health care provider that is often their only lifeline, @PPFA. We must end this dangerous witch hunt. https://t.co/Cn7Gqmg6m3
A big thank you to members of @sunrisemvmt for stopping by my DC office this morning. They talked with my staff about the best ways to #ActOnClimate in the new Congress and beyond. I'm proud to have them as partners in tackling this moral imperative of our time.
Proud to unveil bipartisan draft legislation that helps improve the way @FDA approves and regulates diagnostic tests. As we modernize ways to fight diseases, we need a new regulatory framework to match improvements in diagnostics medicine. Read more: https://t.co/E5JoUcfArA
#Trump's @EPA is undermining its goal of environmental stewardship not only through its actions, but also through troubling inaction on a number of its responsibilities. Lack of oversight from @HouseGOP allowed this agency to steer far from its mission, but now the party's over. https://t.co/6CxWcXLOFD
Meanwhile, #Trump takes us even further from this objective in his quest to protect polluters and erase @POTUS44's efforts to fight #ClimateChange. This #coal proposal is the latest in a long list of actions that harm our environment and our communities. https://t.co/AqtDD1QOvV
Coloradans have spoken loud and clear: #NetNeutrality must be restored to ensure an equal playing field online. We must keep pushing for 218 signatures on the discharge petition to force a vote in the House on reinstating these protections by the end of the year! https://t.co/NDFQHB3vKt
This terrifying chart reveals an even scarier truth -- we're moving in the wrong direction in the fight to stop the devastating effects of #ClimateChange.

“In our new majority, we will continue to fight for every woman’s right to freely access reproductive health care.

#Trump’s cruel proposed changes to the public charge rule could prevent many immigrants, many of whom are AAPI, from receiving much-needed assistance. On this #AAPI day of action, we must say #NoToPublicCharge to protect all who would be harmed by this misguided effort.
The #LWCF has been instrumental in preserving our public lands, but its future is in jeopardy since its funding lapsed in October.

The National Climate Assessment warns that #ClimateChange will wreak havoc on Colorado's water supply, affecting everything from agriculture to winter sports to our local breweries. Whether #Trump believes it or not, the findings are clear: we must #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/6wcMmmQsVL
#Trump's attempt to bury the National Climate Assessment can't hide the facts: The #climate crisis is also a public health crisis that could cost us precious lives and billions of dollars. Keep spreading the word -- our future depends on it. https://t.co/CF2WGdfgqa
Colorado's outdoor economy could be decimated by #ClimateChange, according to the National Climate Assessment.

Though #Trump tried to bury the National Climate Assessment, we will keep pushing to highlight the report's dire warnings about the effects of #ClimateChange. They are happening now and harming us all, especially the most vulnerable -- as this graphic from the report makes clear. https://t.co/LpHippC6Se
A week ago, the National Climate Assessment was released, detailing the dramatic and damaging effects of #ClimateChange now and in the future. We can't let this groundbreaking report fade into the news cycle; its alarming findings are too critical to ignore. #ClimateFriday
This hack makes last year's massive #Equifax data breach look like child's play. Apparently none of us can count on the security of our private information, and it's downright scary. As Co-Chair of the Privacy Caucus, I'll keep working to get answers and prevent future breaches. https://t.co/bw6z16B2RD
This change attacks core pillars of the #ACA that help Americans with pre-existing conditions secure health insurance. If we don't stop this sabotage, we could return to the dark days when many were denied coverage. This is not empowering consumers. https://t.co/Tjq1VSMa1P
We must fight to secure a vote in the House to restore #NetNeutrality. A free and open internet helps provide greater knowledge, freedom of speech and economic opportunity for Coloradans and all Americans. We can't give up until these protections are reinstated. https://t.co/8QRJnqqM1J

.@BetsyDeVosED is wrong to propose changes to #TitleIX that make it harder for sexual assault survivors to come forward. My colleagues and I challenged this irresponsible move in a letter sent to her today. We can't deny victims the chance to seek justice. https://t.co/hKI1owotpr
The 115th Congress is drawing to a close, and time's running out to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality. We need 218 votes on the discharge petition I signed to force a vote on this priority and save the free and open internet. Be sure to spread the word today! https://t.co/UlI9KhR7hK
We need answers about how officials are determining when separation is necessary for the child’s safety. I demanded info from @SecNielsen in an earlier letter and will ensure @HouseDemocrats use our power in the majority to shine a light on these actions. https://t.co/qRnE1MKj7u

We must hold this administration accountable for every action it has taken to advance its reckless, xenophobic agenda that strips people of their humanity and dignity. This can't be who we are as a nation. We must be better than this.  My statement: https://t.co/M9cT5lVbBb
This, coupled with the #Trump administration's recent actions authorizing U.S. troops stationed there to use lethal force if necessary, represents another step in the ongoing militarization of our border that threatens to harm even more innocent people. https://t.co/zv8dmFLy8G
Federal agents' use of tear gas on innocent civilians, many of them children, at our southern border is a shocking and heavy-handed use of force that we must condemn and heavily scrutinize.
The #Trump Admin. cynically tried to hide the most recent National Climate Assessment, waiting to release it during the holiday weekend. So help spread the serious conclusions from experts across the federal gov't and share their work that Trump is afraid for people to see. https://t.co/rcIBxjYl02

I guess now that @EPAAWheeler has sufficiently proven his commitment to environmental degradation, #Trump's willing to give him a permanent gig. He shouldn't get too confident though. Soon, @HouseDemocrats will have the subpoena power needed to hold @EPA fully accountable. https://t.co/klgcsoaCZq

It's an honor to be named a Diabetes Champion along with my congressional colleagues. Diabetes doesn't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat, which is why Congress must keep coming together in a bipartisan manner to strengthen advocacy efforts and find a cure. https://t.co/otXhShqIkG
I heartily applaud this action by @US_FDA to significantly limit the availability of these products, which are luring in a new generation of tobacco users. Better yet, Congress should also pass my #Tobaccoto21 bill to further safeguard the health of our kids. https://t.co/7wUvhbVnGx

As we prepare for a new Congress next year, I've announced my candidacy for Democratic Whip in the House. With a narrow majority and a diverse caucus, we'll need a whip with the experience to build broad coalitions and win votes that help advance our values.

Desperate people fleeing for their lives seek #asylum in the U.S. Our country has legal obligations to provide protection to those who qualify as #refugees. Trump’s dire pronouncements about people streaming over the border under the guise of seeking asylum is mere fearmongering.
Latinas in the U.S. earn 53 cents for every dollar made by a white, non-Hispanic man. On #LatinaEqualPayDay, we reaffirm our pledge to close this unacceptable #paygap. One way we can help achieve this, for Latinas and for all women, is by passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct. https://t.co/yydP4XZHU9

We've made progress through systemic reforms and funding in #21stCenturyCures, but must do more to improve care, increase communication &amp; reduce stigma here and around the globe. #WorldMentalHealthDay https://t.co/HHuJiPds5S
Big News: The Senate has just passed #WRDA, which contains my bipartisan bill with @RepRichHudson promoting small #hydropower projects on existing infrastructure. This renewable energy source is good for the planet and the economy, and our soon-to-be law further buoys it.
This #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth, we honor the survivors, stand with those who are battling the disease, and pledge to keep working for cures. #21stCenturyCures bolstered this effort through the Cancer Moonshot, but we can't stop there. Together, we can beat breast cancer. https://t.co/fFXodBItC1
The new @UN climate report explains the stakes: We must act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough within 12 years to prevent irreversible damage to ecosystems worldwide and our communities. This is the moral imperative of our lifetime. https://t.co/7hXSeVjv5e
One year after reversing the Clean Power Plan, #ToxicTrump and his allies continue to loosen regulations on polluters, ignoring the effects of #climatechange and doing nothing to prevent it from getting much worse in the near future. I’m working to stop this recklessness. https://t.co/9yFFDj7toM
We can't continue to rely on the courts to stop #Trump's cruel and xenophobic agenda. We need action. That's why I support the #AmericanPromiseAct to protect #TPS recipients and am pushing for comprehensive immigration reform to thwart his attacks on American ideals. https://t.co/mmLzFjRnhe
Just months after I led this letter opposing @EPA's "transparency rule," @washingtonpost reports the agency ignored the concerns of its top scientists regarding this change. @EPA's not listening to reason or to Congress; @HouseCommerce should investigate. https://t.co/A0kazWFn0C https://t.co/pGfZyXCdNy
Through @HouseCommerce, I've been investigating #Russia's doping scheme, but its efforts to subvert the institutions holding it accountable may be even more egregious. This indictment further shows @wada_ama should reconsider its decision to reinstate Russia's anti-doping agency. https://t.co/RtO4pE2zOd
The #opioids bill passed by the Senate means more research and better targeted funding to fight opioid abuse, but it is by no means comprehensive. I'll keep working through @HouseCommerce to develop more far-reaching solutions that tackle every stage of addiction and recovery. https://t.co/dxVlywFmI1
.@RepTomReed and I have heard from many stakeholders in our quest to determine the causes of rising insulin prices. Today, we invite you to share your stories about how this public health crisis has affected you - from now until Thursday, Oct 11. Details: https://t.co/0l4YmIieRn https://t.co/EOeLGPBTwI
For decades, #LGBTQ Coloradans have worked tirelessly and fearlessly to make the Centennial State a leader in rights and protections for this community. This #LGBTHistoryMonth, we honor their contributions and pledge to continue the crusade for full #equality. We'll get there. https://t.co/sz9tXSJ3U2
Trump’s @StateDept was wrong to omit int'l data on #reprorights in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. It can't disregard info on this fundamental freedom. That's why my colleagues and I sent a letter to @SecPompeo opposing this action. https://t.co/7ARYa4vknv
Congrats to our @Rockies on their stunning and record-breaking game last night against the @Cubs! The nerve-racking extra innings were worth the thrill of victory. #Rocktober continues, and this will be our year! https://t.co/kTY9BIx5ek
This decision by the #Trump admin. creates needless and possibly dangerous obstacles for foreign diplomats in the U.S., many of whom are from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal. Why force them to marry in order to live in this country? https://t.co/ZjRQsP57hw
A new report by @DHSOIG confirms what we’ve long suspected: #Trump's #FamilySeparation policy was a disaster from day one -- devoid of any planning, coordination or basic human compassion -- and only got worse from there. This is a study in blind bigotry. https://t.co/cnbhp7bDpT https://t.co/VkKAtGLn5k
Time and again, the biggest victims of the #Trump administration's cruel, reckless and chaotic immigration policies are helpless children. We can't let ideologues continue to use them as pawns in their dangerous efforts. I'll keep fighting this. https://t.co/f3TYjtXZZK
On this day 42 years ago, the #HydeAmendment barred federal funding for abortion. For too long, this provision has unfairly blocked low-income women from exercising their #reprorights. That’s why we must pass our bill, the #EachWomanAct, to repeal it. #BeBoldEndHyde https://t.co/dwz7IbX24Q
Proud to take part in this case. We need to establish whether President Trump is obeying the law. https://t.co/ILy3WN8oco
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including my work to stop the shameful #Kavanaugh confirmation process, finding ways to reduce maternal mortality, meeting with Colorado advocates in DC and celebrating #NationalVoterRegistrationDay . https://t.co/qEoQnESVpe
Even #Trump Admin can’t deny human activity promotes #globalwarming. Still, they twist the analysis, saying that given a potential 7-degree rise in temps – which would be catastrophic – weaker vehicle fuel standards won’t make much of a difference. How short-sighted and cynical. https://t.co/aEyeOo31eG
This week's #Kavanaugh hearing sparked an important national conversation about sexual assault but also unearthed painful memories for victims and survivors. If you or a loved one is struggling, you can call 1-800-656-4673 for free, confidential support, 24/7. https://t.co/R16ESwpOUy
Disgusting that @SenateGOP is still “pushing through” #BrettKavanaugh's confirmation, to quote @senatemajldr, despite these disturbing sexual assault allegations. Colleagues and I walked to @senjudiciary this morning to oppose this sham and stand in solidarity with his accusers. https://t.co/QRKYz9urAs
Donald Trump Jr.’s Denver Post diatribe against Democrats is not the Colorado way. We expect, and respect, rational discourse on issues. If this is a White House “Hail Mary” pass to influence the upcoming elections, we now know how desperate they are. https://t.co/KMPeLBSvq3
Rod #Rosenstein shouldn’t be fired or forced to resign for doing his job. Who would be next: #Mueller? That’s why Congress needs to pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, but the House majority won’t bring it up for a vote. https://t.co/Fh2NouhRkN
Good meeting with Coloradans from @ProtectWinters to discuss #climatechange's threat to the outdoor industry, along with the need to pass my #COWilderness2018 bill to preserve our state's wild places. Colorado’s economy depends on these efforts to protect our natural splendor. https://t.co/ASxjGUwZeQ
I applaud Dr. Ford for bravely sharing the details of her sexual assault before @senjudiciary today. Her earnest testimony, and mounting allegations from other women, prove #BrettKavanaugh is unfit to receive a lifetime appointment to #SCOTUS. #Trump must withdraw his nomination. https://t.co/Pb2ZMAd9wk
Pregnancy-related death rates are rising in the U.S. One way Congress can help reverse this alarming trend: pass H.R. 1318, my bill with @HereraBeutler promoting state-based solutions. More from today's @HouseCommerce hearing on #maternalmortality: https://t.co/eX8U3Gm1YO https://t.co/pvr4ITPfrx
Great to meet with two Coloradans committed to clean sport  -- Travis Tygart, CEO of @usantidoping and Olympic bronze medalist @emmajcoburn. This is an important goal, which is why I'm working to investigate the serious issue of doping in organized sports through @HouseCommerce. https://t.co/mCvoTRKSD9
Good news: The House just voted to approve $500 million in funds to fight the #opioid epidemic. This builds on two years of funding for this fight from my #21stCenturyCures Act. We’re forging ahead with several initiatives, but there’s still a long way to go.
I joined @HouseDemocrats in affirming our strong opposition to #BrettKavanaugh's nomination to #SCOTUS. We can't let @SenateGOP steamroll through his confirmation; there must be a full investigation of the multiple sexual assault allegations against him. It's a moral imperative. https://t.co/VTZlNuCM8V
.@StoryCorps' One Small Step initiative is helping bridge the political divide through dialogue. I was pleased to take part in this effort with my compadre from across the aisle @RepFredUpton in a candid chat about strengthening bipartisanship in Congress. Stay tuned for that. https://t.co/LTwRLbAJLc
Voting is a right for which many Americans have had to struggle. On #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, let’s recommit to exercising this freedom and fighting against voter suppression efforts still underway across America. Register to vote here: https://t.co/RWbcpev3YP https://t.co/pY81tHDSto
Christine Blasey Ford is a hero. Her letter to @SenJudiciary Chairman @ChuckGrassley shows selflessness and willingness to sacrifice to tell her truth to power. His reply today promises a fair hearing, but with a veiled attack for not being braver sooner. That’s “respect?” https://t.co/3cRGRSc8Ih
The mounting allegations against #BrettKavanaugh further prove the need to halt @SenateGOP's sham of a confirmation that values partisan politics over evidence and decency. @FBI must thoroughly investigate his past before @senjudiciary can determine his future on the court.
This latest #Trump attempt to limit legal #immigration with racially-loaded tactics cannot stand. People who qualify for green cards shouldn’t be blocked for seeking food or health care for their families. That’s against this country’s long-held values. https://t.co/oXvraNOpsC
Happy #NationalPublicLandsDay. Today you can explore our national parks for free: https://t.co/NFr6gv7bJD  I’ll keep fighting back against #Trump’s attack on our public lands and am working to protect Colorado’s last remaining wild places through my #COwilderness2018 legislation. https://t.co/RnBsSdQfsl
In @SenateMajLdr's world, letting Dr. Ford tell her story is a bigger threat than confirming her alleged sexual aggressor to #SCOTUS for life. Republicans are willing to smear &amp; ignore her credible allegations for political expediency. We can't let them. We must #PostponeTheVote https://t.co/1RqzHc7ATf
Honored to receive NEWSED Community Development's Civil Rights Award, along with such people as @GDSFoundation’s Michelle Sie Whitten, pictured here. I've fought for civil rights all my life and won't stop until we achieve equality for all. https://t.co/67NNxDAJqw
One year after #Maria made landfall in #PuertoRico, our fellow Americans there are still suffering. The damage done was unimaginable, as I witnessed first-hand with my congressional colleagues, and the recovery is far from over. We must continue to #StandWithPuertoRico. https://t.co/CtnKi3DjmT
Congrats to @DenverHealthMed on the groundbreaking of its new Outpatient Medical Center, a state-of-the-art facility that will significantly increase its capacity. I was on hand to celebrate this achievement, and I pledge continued support for our vital #CommunityHealthCenters. https://t.co/yC0tRGvM4j
I've cosponsored this resolution to make sure #Trump meets his legal obligation to consult with Congress before setting an annual refugee cap -- and to make it clear we should open our doors to more, not fewer, refugees. It's our duty as Americans. https://t.co/kWxmxLzm8L
I remain committed to working with @TeamUSA and @usantidoping to ensure that our top athletes, many of whom live and train in Colorado, compete around the world with integrity. Today’s @wada_ama decision fails clean athletes around the world who are playing by the rules.
In February 2017, I highlighted this controversy through @HouseCommerce hearings that examined Russia’s state sponsored doping program and its fallout. https://t.co/tEQa2yZNHK
This decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency is a major blow to clean sport around the world. Allowing the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency fails to hold them accountable for the cheating and fraud that took place at the Sochi Olympics. https://t.co/oa5eTnFlYx
The internet and social media have revolutionized how innovators start small businesses, but the repeal of #NetNeutrality threatens this essential tool. That's just one of many reasons why I signed the discharge petition to force a vote to restore these vital protections. https://t.co/FQjsXev9p5
Honored to join my colleagues in this effort to hold President #Trump accountable for his unforgivable remarks. To cover for his admin’s failures, he has insulted the memory of #Maria's victims and belittled the ongoing struggles of survivors. They need help, not disrespect. https://t.co/LkKNMk07kX
What a wonderful initiative. As the #Trump administration continues to undermine immigrants and refugees, it's heartening to see our Colorado communities affirm their worth. That's real leadership. https://t.co/A31KCOOMRz
The proposed methane rule by @SecretaryZinke’s Bureau of Land Management is a gift to industry polluters. It would promote global warming and let potential royalties from a byproduct of natural gas production go up in smoke. I’m protesting this proposal. https://t.co/MeuBEoZltS https://t.co/qL9wlOZj9g
Met with student leaders of @DefendOurFuture in Denver, where we stood shoulder to shoulder with @e2org’s Susan Nedell and @DDPHE’s Elizabeth Babcock to protest #Trump’s proposed #CleanerCars rollback. Colorado should have the right to maintain its own, higher standards. https://t.co/rbG0n2itkP
An informative, encouraging visit to @SendGrid, including a tour and talk with employees. On the agenda: #netneutrality, entrepreneurs and Colorado's future. Companies such as SendGrid help make Denver a tech hub and one of the most innovative cities in the nation. https://t.co/RH0MJmyKJt
This is sickening.. #Trump seems determined to close America's door to all those yearning to breathe free until it’s shut completely. We have to fight this extreme agenda. A nation that shuts itself off to the world will only suffocate on its own fear, isolation and hatred. https://t.co/4H8mhX2J5i

.@Senjudiciary Chairman @ChuckGrassley &amp; @SenateMajLdr have so far refused to let Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testify about her allegations of sexual assault against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. She deserves to tell her story, &amp; Americans need to hear it. @SenateGOP must let her speak. https://t.co/t4VgQJ6UTT
How brave of her to come forward. In light of this development, the scheduled vote on #Kavanaugh’s confirmation should be delayed so these serious allegations can be investigated. https://t.co/cvFE1odIHa
Today is the beginning of National #HispanicHeritageMonth, on occasion to celebrate the vast contributions this group has made to the U.S. I'm proud to represent a vibrant Hispanic community, and I'll continue working to protect these Coloradans' right to the American Dream. https://t.co/7S5jasoyQU
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including advancing two of my bipartisan bills, opposing Trump's plan to allow more harmful #methane emissions, preventing wildfires and their devastating effects, and celebrating #HispanicHeritageMonth. https://t.co/2eYckxc9ed
Wildfires devastated Colorado and much of the west this summer, and the threat could get worse if we don't find new ways to better manage our forests and #ClimateChange. At a @HouseCommerce hearing today, I spoke about the effects in CO and how to prevent future fires. https://t.co/pMmKLjmitA
Thrilled that the House just passed a package of bills containing H.R. 2786, my bipartisan bill with @RepRichHudson promoting smaller #hydropower projects on existing infrastructure, bringing good jobs and clean, domestic energy to communities across America. On to the Senate! https://t.co/JddPHvtxQG
Nearly 3000 Americans died in #PuertoRico and #USVI, but #Trump chooses to belittle this tragedy I saw firsthand. He should be working with Congress to strengthen #Maria rebuilding efforts and prevent future failures. Instead he insults the memory of the storm's victims.
I'm supporting a resolution led by @RepVeasey declaring September "National Voting Rights Month" to oppose voter suppression tactics nationwide. We can't let a handful of politicians erode peoples' right to hold them accountable at the ballot box. We must protect this right. https://t.co/FwoiVbBoRp
#Trump talks big about being ready for #Florence, but this news proves his real priorities: shifting @FEMA disaster readiness &amp; response funds toward programs under ICE, the rogue agency responsible for implementing the infamous “zero tolerance” policy. https://t.co/uAH7Bk3Oc6
Pleased @US_FDA is strengthening its efforts to hold e-cig manufacturers accountable for protecting our kids' health. Better yet, Congress should pass my "Tobacco to 21" bill that goes even further to keep these addictive products out of their hands. https://t.co/NLqGV9ghlW
#Trump's @EPA has just proposed a rollback of Obama-era rules that helped reduce harmful #methane waste. These standards were proven to work, and I have been pushing the agency to enforce them. Now, I'll work to prevent this shameless giveaway to polluters. #cutmethane https://t.co/HhRptV5ERV
I was honored last night to speak about my experiences in public service at the kick-off event for @msudenver's Upsilon Rho Chapter of @PSANational, an honor society for political science students.

Today I was pleased to hold a community forum with residents of Cherry Hills Village. With so many of our hard-won rights and opportunities under threat in Washington, Coloradans must come together to discuss how best to defend and promote our Western values. https://t.co/Jg3uLc0qnV
Later, I met with representatives of the @mssociety's Colorado-Wyoming Chapter, which is dedicated to improving the lives of people living with #MultipleSclerosis and advancing life-saving research. I passed #21stCenturyCures into law to help achieve these breakthroughs. https://t.co/0fmUPH1cmh

Great community forum at Abraham Lincoln High. We discussed what’s happening in Washington and how it affects Colorado — from presidential overreach to preventing a government shutdown this month. Thank you to the constituents who joined us in person and on Facebook Live. https://t.co/Rqsdw9dZ1G
Today's the day - our community forum will start in an hour. I'm looking forward to a lively and productive discussion about the ongoing effort to protect and promote our western values. I hope to see you there. https://t.co/TSGo7xY8uq

These concerns have only grown since our panel in June. This year's historic drought has forced Colorado micro-brewers and thirsty patrons to face a future with less water for beer. That too is a big incentive for fighting #ClimateChange. Read more: https://t.co/RXnppjv8Mm

Despite bipartisan support, @HouseGOP voted down my amendment to H.R. 4606. It would have helped reduce waste and fight #ClimateChange by ensuring LNG exports are produced in ways that prevent methane emissions from leaks and flaring. A setback, but I’ll keep pressing for reform. https://t.co/o7YIi8hOhc
At a @HouseCommerce hearing, I spoke about the need to protect nursing home residents' access to the courts. For too long, many facilities have forced people into arbitration agreements that strip them of their legal right to challenge abuse. We must end this bad practice. https://t.co/DnjIVtgvT0
Bombshell revelation in @nytimes further proves #Kavanaugh's commitment to overturning #RoevWade. Regardless of what he says at his confirmation hearing, newly uncovered emails show he thinks the court can reverse precedent. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/4kSw9i2euM https://t.co/viR4ADrxPO
Online movements such as #MeToo show that @Twitter is empowering women, but it's also exposing them to harassment and abuse. At a @HouseCommerce hearing, I asked CEO @Jack about this significant issue, and am pleased that the company is taking steps to tackle it. https://t.co/6iDKqqXWbQ
.@BetsyDeVosED's response arrived today. She has the power to prevent schools from using federal funds to arm teachers, but she refuses to use it. Congress must act to stop this negligence and protect our kids. https://t.co/aTxUkVpMAQ
.@Twitter CEO @Jack is in Washington testifying to @HouseCommerce. I'm asking him to detail what’s being done to protect women from harassment and threats of violence on the platform. We must strive for civil and safe dialogue. https://t.co/4vD46PEqCc
Thank you @SenFeinstein for calling out Judge #Kavanaugh's slippery stance. His remark that #Roe is settled law is no guarantee of his actions if confirmed to #SCOTUS. @JudiciaryDems must keep the pressure on to ensure he makes clear where he stands on this constitutional right. https://t.co/b5n8R9xtka
Air traffic controllers are vital to keeping our skies safe. I met today with Colorado members of @NATCA visiting DC to ensure that authorization for the FAA, which expires soon, is signed into law – and that we avoid a government shutdown as the September 30 deadline looms. https://t.co/fTim8Pl3cC
U.S. women face an unacceptably high risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Congress must advance H.R. 1318, my bipartisan bill with @HerreraBeutler - it will strengthen data collection on #maternalmortality and help identify solutions. https://t.co/J3us6Hu8Av https://t.co/WZS0K6t0zc
I’ve just introduced a measure to help keep #methane leaks to a minimum whenever someone in this country exports liquid natural gas. Methane’s a proven contributor to #ClimateChange. We can and must prevent leaks wherever possible. Read it here: https://t.co/NELolOJIE3 https://t.co/GxXvY9Fubr
.@SenateGOP dumps 42,000 documents about Judge #Kavanaugh and then starts confirmation hearing the very next day? This is an insult to the American people and the integrity of the #SCOTUS nomination process. @Senjudiciary must #postpone the hearing to ensure its fairness.
On #LaborDay, we honor U.S. workers &amp; those throughout history who fought for their rights while pledging to stop #Trump's attacks on them. A president who cancels pay raises for civilian federal employees while cutting taxes for the ultra-rich is no friend to working families. https://t.co/rHCt0cCm5Z

Meanwhile, a top advocate for student loan borrowers at @CFPB has stepped down due to the bureau's lack of support for this priority. The #Trump admin. is failing us across the board in the fight against predatory student loan lending. This has to stop. https://t.co/MxMgFvqocT
.@BetsyDeVosED wants to make it harder for students to seek loan relief after being defrauded by unscrupulous for-profit colleges. I'm pushing back, sending her a letter outlining why this proposed rule harms the very people @usedgov should be helping. https://t.co/fzMud05Bjy
The next stop on my #TopOfTheTownVisits tour: The southern-inspired @JulepDenver, which was awarded Editors' Choice for Best New Restaurant by @5280Magazine. I stopped by and presented my letter of congrats to Kyle Foster, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Katy. Kudos! https://t.co/QTQIlKYCVL

Senator John McCain was a man who, throughout his life, showed us the meaning of duty, bravery and integrity. I honor him for his decades of service to our country and send my deepest condolences to his family. Rest In Peace.
Great meeting with Dr. Jeanne Feuerstein and Dr. Lisa Deuel of @CUAnschutz’ Neurology Department to talk about advancing @AANMember's priorities, including drug pricing and research funding. These doctors need our continued support to help save and improve more lives. https://t.co/4GBqlZHPZu
And both are close confidants of #Trump — some of those “best people” he claims he hires. If we are judged by the company we keep, then today’s developments make even clearer the vital need to continue investigating the extent of the corruption surrounding our President. https://t.co/VQ5CN5lO0z

Alternation Brewing Company is @5280Magazine's Editors' Choice for Best New Brewery, and I was happy to meet its husband and wife co-owners, Brendan Pleskow and Jenn Sickels (and baby Avery), to congratulate them on this achievement. More #TopOfTheTownVisits coming soon. https://t.co/KGe6hYV7kR
We can't let ideologues in the #Trump administration harm public health, pollute our environment and slow the fight against #climatechange through their shameful twisting of @EPA’s mission and legacy. I'll continue working to push back on these startling developments.
Even worse, @EPA wants to silence the research that led to this estimated health impact -- the 'Six Cities' health study. Under its new "transparency rule," such data could not be used for rulemaking. I led a letter opposing this Orwellian policy. https://t.co/27H4uei5aa
Simply unconscionable. With these new rules, @EPA takes its reckless repeal of @POTUS44's environmental legacy to new depths, admitting the plan will result in an additional 1,400 premature deaths, while also prolonging unsustainable carbon emissions. https://t.co/LW7ORugpAF
To mark #StartUpWeek, I visited @Enterprise5280 and spoke with local entrepreneurs about the unique opportunities and challenges they face in their line of work. I'm working to help them by supporting small business lending programs, student loan relief and more. https://t.co/0qUp4NL2NV
Supporting small businesses means supporting #NetNeutrality. Small businesses need the internet to reach customers, promote products, and make sales. I signed the discharge petition to restore #NetNeutrality rules and help these entrepreneurs and innovators. https://t.co/ffFJ3o7sxY
Today and every day, a #freepress helps keep our country - and others - free. https://t.co/C1wWHxaA1z
This is not only petty and spiteful, it’s short-sighted. If @POTUS can’t stand criticism by national security experts who are now outside our government, one wonders what voices he’s listening to in the White House &amp; abroad. Or do we really have to wonder? https://t.co/In0FbnPbOt
Wonderful to once again meet with members of @ADLDenver, an organization that's ever-vigilant in its efforts to fight hate and discrimination.

Great meeting yesterday with members of @CLLAROQueSi, a group working on behalf of Colorado Latinos. I spoke with them about my efforts on a number of their top priorities, including working to #ProtectDreamers, #ReuniteFamilies, strengthen lifelines for seniors and more. https://t.co/OXkLXgR08W
The Trump Administration is trying to rip away protections for the 2,350,900 people in Colorado who have pre-existing conditions. My fellow Democrats and I are working hard to #ProtectOurCare from Republican sabotage.
Glad the court is standing up for science, but it's also a reminder that #ScottPruitt refused to ban #chlorpyrifos against the advice of EPA scientists. I pushed against his decision and will keep demanding @EPA return to setting policy based on science, not corporate influence. https://t.co/l9WI9K1JgB
Repealing #NetNeutrality has real consequences for Americans. Without these safeguards, consumers could be forced to pay extra fees to use certain websites or apps. This is one of many reasons why I'm working to force a vote in the House to restore these protections.
In another highlight from our telephone town hall, I speak about my efforts to tackle high prescription drug prices. They include a bipartisan inquiry into rising insulin costs. This investigation, launched via the Diabetes Caucus, which I co-chair, is already getting answers. https://t.co/MvBszSiGGR
Important reminder: You can apply for a #DACA renewal even if your last application was rejected specifically due to not meeting the October 5, 2017 deadline. Apply →https://t.co/zezSgvAqxy https://t.co/f13yst6Lz3
Thanks to all who participated in our live telephone town hall last night -- we had a great discussion. In this clip from the event, I speak about the critical need to rein in ICE, which is acting as a rogue agency, and #reunitefamilies that remain separated by the #Trump admin. https://t.co/JZJGl0rv8R
Our telephone town hall is about to begin! Stream it live at https://t.co/luqHrSDCCg. I’m looking forward to this timely discussion about issues of importance to our community and our nation. https://t.co/CP8aKYMB5m
Congrats to Denver, which is number five on the list of large cities producing the most @AmeriCorps members. This exciting news highlights what we already know -- that residents of our community possess a passion for public service that we must continue to foster and strengthen. https://t.co/7Pd3TrySvl
A black woman in America must work until August 7 this year to catch up with the average pay for white, non-Hispanic men in 2017 alone. On #BlackWomensEqualPay Day, and every day, we pledge to close this unacceptable gap. Passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct can help us achieve that.
My live telephone town hall is happening tonight at 6:00 p.m. MT. If you'd like to register to receive a call, sign up at https://t.co/luqHrSDCCg before 5:00 p.m. MT or stream the event live on the same page. I hope you'll join me for this important community discussion. https://t.co/Jc38Y7lC7t
My #TopOfTheTownVisits continue with a stop at Denver's The Tatarian, this year's Editors' Choice for "Best New Bar" by @5280Magazine. I was pleased to meet manager Josh Sevy (left) and owners Mike Huggins and Lenka Juchelkova, and pass along my note of congratulations to them. https://t.co/rQ1c7D6Vqf
Indeed, as we celebrate this anniversary, we must also unite to counter the unprecedented attack against #VotingRights, particularly in the wake of #ShelbyvHolder. I'm supporting the Voting Rights Amendment Act to counter these voter suppression tactics and protect this freedom. https://t.co/7ccqwpX3Wv
This is a big win in our fight to #ProtectDreamers but not a final victory. We must keep working towards a legislative solution to give these young people permanent protection. Ultimately, we need comprehensive immigration reform that values the contributions of all immigrants. https://t.co/X3Ezp6yscj
This desperation would be laughable if it wasn't so reprehensible. Taking responsibility for one's actions is a basic principle, as well as having compassion. The #Trump admin. hasn't grasped either, but we will hold it accountable for these wrongdoings. https://t.co/sXfRIoNqGU
Thanks @coloradobrewers for the warm welcome &amp; lively discussion. This industry has been a boon to our state, &amp; I'm working to strengthen it by supporting legislation that provides financial relief to these small businesses, such as #HR747, to tax craft brewers more equitably. https://t.co/cZnQh4KIxK
Yesterday, I visited ClearSpring Pharmacy in Denver to speak about H.R. 5333, my bill that upgrades @US_FDA's approval process for over-the-counter drugs – promoting innovation and improving consumer safety. It passed the House in July, and I'll keep working to make it law. https://t.co/h2k5dbhTqx

My fellow leaders on @HouseCommerce and I sent letters to three drug manufacturers demanding answers about their role in the #opioid epidemic. More than 115 Americans are dying every day from this crisis, and we must hold every stakeholder accountable. https://t.co/w9NSbNsReT
My first visit this week was to @TheBinderyLtd, winner of the Readers’ Choice Award for "Best New Restaurant,” where I was happy to present my letter to chef/owner Linda Hampsten Fox. Congrats to this hard-working and talented entrepreneur. Stay tuned for more #TopOfTheTownVisits https://t.co/XMM1U0tD6Q
This year, I'm hand-delivering letters to some of the magazine’s "best new" winners to personally welcome them to our community and thank them for their contributions.
For many years, I've written letters of congratulations to winners in our congressional district of @5280Magazine's "Top of the Town" awards, which are given annually to outstanding local businesses in the Front Range.
The #Trump Admin. is undermining health and costing taxpayers at the pump through this proposed rule. It would freeze key efforts to fight #climatechange and stop Colorado from setting its own standards for #CleanerCars. That’s why I support legislation to stop this rollback. https://t.co/ke7ANrOKHf
On #ColoradoDay, we reflect on our state's unique history while reaffirming our commitment to securing its future. As a fourth-generation Coloradan, I want to ensure new generations have the same opportunities here that I received. We can make that happen if we work together. https://t.co/cS60LVb4X5
To borrow a phrase from @TopherSpiro, these junk plans are "the Trump University equivalent of health insurance." They make big promises, but end up scamming working people. @POTUS promotes them in his ongoing quest to sabotage the #ACA. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/iXalJZrnEr
Today, I met with staff of the U.S. Center for SafeSport in Denver, which is dedicated to ending sexual abuse in Olympic, Paralympic and amateur sports. Through @HouseCommerce, I'm also working to advance this goal and pledge to help SafeSport strengthen these ongoing efforts. https://t.co/AGl1LpKUou
I'm holding another live telephone town hall next Tuesday, August 7 at 6:00 p.m. MT to discuss the latest in Congress and to hear from you. The fight to protect our western values continues, and your input is invaluable in that effort. Sign up here: https://t.co/RzOWMCNvss https://t.co/rPFOx2t8bb
As the #Trump admin. continues its lumbering attempt to #ReuniteFamilies, @washingtonpost delves deep into the cruelty and lack of coordination that created this disaster, which has been described as "...child kidnapping, plain and simple." A must read: https://t.co/JLsDfbdJ8O
.@MealsOnWheels provides nutritional and emotional sustenance for seniors across America. Today, I met two of them -- Belinda Walker and Lujean Hopper -- when I joined @VOAColorado on a delivery route in Park Hill in Denver. We must protect this lifeline from #Trump's attacks. https://t.co/vraFoq1FPo
Four days after the Trump admin. missed its court-mandated deadline to #reunitefamilies, more than 700 children remain separated from their parents. Their suffering continues without end due to Trump officials’ cruelty and incompetence. This calamity must be remedied right now. https://t.co/S9X9avEvfa
Wishing my friend @RepJohnLewis a speedy recovery..You are in my prayers. https://t.co/Zy8MjiSs6f
Sara Moore, Executive Director of Dragon 5280, likes to say this festival is a passport to Asia without leaving Denver. There sure is a lot to see and do, with no jet lag to slow you down! #cdbf2018 https://t.co/YqXsh6ei57
The marketplace provided a forum for community groups and services to shine. Deborah Philbrick, Amanda Carlson and Shea Vance were flying the flag for women’s health and rights on behalf of @NARALColorado. #cdbf2018 https://t.co/RkFXS5QeiU
I was honored to take the symbolic step of painting the dragon’s eye. Some of these boats were almost too beautiful to go into the water. #cdbf2018 https://t.co/rFSEIHZ0cM
With Clarence Low, President &amp; CEO of the Asian American Chamber of Commerce, Colorado, a central hub for business networking and economic development. #cdbf2018 https://t.co/yLpQvofKz2
What a great kickoff to the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival: Ceremony, song, food, community, and of course exciting matchups between the exotic watercraft, decorated by hand and powered by muscle. A celebration of Asian and #AsianAmerican heritage for all to enjoy. #cdbf2018 https://t.co/QTWnWo0Wrk
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including introducing two important bills, holding the Trump admin. accountable to #reunitefamilies, cracking down on shady drug treatment centers and inviting you to my latest live telephone town hall. https://t.co/y67ZvqPMZi
Read more: https://t.co/iGlqgGQnpc
This is welcome news. Of course, we’ll still keep working to block #ScottPruitt's sneaky move to put more super-polluting trucks on U.S. roads as he left @EPAgov – especially since the #GOP blocked my legislative fix for that dirty trick. We CAN defeat his attack on clean air. https://t.co/bycbPCl9vE
I've introduced the ChiPACC Act, bipartisan legislation that creates a #Medicaid care program to help families better manage children's life-threatening illnesses. This bill fills unacceptable gaps in coverage and provides greater #ComprehensiveCare4Kids. https://t.co/m7OWn13qp0 https://t.co/kdZZ0a4WQN
On Tuesday, Aug. 7 at 6:00 p.m. MT, I'll be holding another live telephone town hall to provide an update on the many important things happening in Congress and to hear from you. I'm looking forward to a great discussion. Stay tuned for details on how to sign up to participate. https://t.co/uEtusXAy2y
A free and open internet is essential to students’ success. We need to restore #NetNeutrality to ensure young people have access to the online content they need to succeed.
And people wonder why @HouseGOP can't pass funding bills into law. Perhaps if they focused more on implementing compassionate and common-sense reforms at @DHSgov instead of egregious riders that attack #reprorights, we could finally make some progress. https://t.co/V2WRRazN1q
#21stCenturyCures empowers @NIH to conduct more life-saving research. At today's @HouseCommerce hearing on implementation of this 2016 law, I asked @NIHDirector Francis Collins about the agency's efforts to determine better alternatives to #opioids for pain management. Watch: https://t.co/Cu41jAOUnW
There is one day left to meet the court-mandated deadline to #reunitefamilies, yet the #Trump admin. admits in a court filing that more than 460 parents may have been deported without their kids. This is unacceptable. We won't let @POTUS get away with this cruelty and negligence. https://t.co/0RFzifQfbn
Great meeting w/reps of Denver's Atlantis Community, Inc. &amp; other CO. disability advocates in DC for the National Council on Independent Living conference. These folks show what the #disability community can achieve through unified advocacy &amp; policy that empowers. @NationalADAPT https://t.co/k79eaE6tDF
I authored #21stCenturyCures to improve biomedical research, speed @US_FDA approvals safely and save lives, but the final law was a bipartisan achievement. Today’s @HouseCommerce Health Subcommittee hearing will help ensure it’s being implemented to its fullest potential. https://t.co/j5wsFsvIsN
If confirmed to the Supreme Court, #BrettKavanaugh would work to restrict access to abortion in all 50 states. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to block his nomination, but no matter what happens, I will never stop fighting to protect our hard-fought #ReproRights. @NARAL
The Trump admin. has said in a court filing that more than 460 parents may have been deported w/out their kids. Today I visited the @HHSGov family reunification center, but this news makes clear they won't meet the deadline to #reunitefamilies by July 26. https://t.co/KcoQB6xszD https://t.co/4Gawd6vltk
Members of @ColoradoNORML are visiting DC. We spoke about the need to enable more #cannabis research and discussed progress made on my Respect States and Citizens Rights Act (H.R. 2528), which will keep the federal government from preempting state laws related to #marijuana. https://t.co/Y447oqCvEw
https://t.co/9cpFz9wQGA
Yeah, about that... https://t.co/wM1Mj6QKQx
I vehemently oppose the #AderholtAmendment, which is nothing more than a thinly-veiled #LicenseToDicriminate. This provision allows child welfare organizations to discriminate against #LGBTQ people, denying loving homes for children in adoption and foster care. https://t.co/bs8RkWUivr
We need a comprehensive plan to preserve CO's last remaining wild places from #Trump and special interests. To do this, I've just introduced the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2018, which protects 740,000 acres across the Centennial State. #COWilderness2018 https://t.co/MP6bCdKI7D https://t.co/Td2JqvIcvM
Very proud today of my friend and mentor Elizabeth Holtzman, who understands America's commitment to aiding refugees. We can't let this administration keep families apart nor push out dedicated public servants such as Elizabeth who can keep it in check. https://t.co/VX1SXjkUQl
At today's hearing of @HouseCommerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, we're looking into nefarious and disingenuous advertising on the part of some #opioid treatment centers. I won't stand for bad actors taking advantage of vulnerable people trying to beat addiction. https://t.co/eYM0BRNAZc
.@EPA is planning to undermine strong emissions standards in California, Colorado and many other states making a commitment to public health. That's why I'm sponsoring the Clean and Efficient Cars Act to prevent these rollbacks that harm us all. https://t.co/xmAMAfu0cL
At today’s event for the new Rocky Mountain VA Medical Center, which soon will open its doors to roughly 400,000 Colo. veterans &amp; countless others from the region. They’ll arrive in need of healing and, together with their loved ones, receive the first-class service they deserve. https://t.co/6HqOFTQw7W
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including protecting our democracy from Russian interference, working to #StopKavanaugh, reforming the over-the-counter drug-approval process and reuniting families in Colorado faster. https://t.co/Og8IDZGONy
Thanks to @ICEgov's Denver Field Office Director, Jeffrey Lynch, and local immigration advocates for attending this meeting today. Reuniting families separated by the Trump admin. is a top priority, and our discussion is an important step forward in achieving this vital goal. https://t.co/c3njfcOhNu
@sdesserman Reuniting families separated by the Trump administration is a top priority. That's why I support @RepJerryNadler's Keep Families Together Act (H.R. 6135) to right these wrongs and prevent future separations. https://t.co/ICH4f3yjwS
This cannot stand. I worked to ensure these protections were put in place, and I’ll fight to keep them. https://t.co/3VEoc8tQWd
Until Republicans realize this, they will never have the best interests of our country and its people at heart.
The right to vote is sacred. People have died to secure and defend this vital civic responsibility. We can't fully protect it for every American until we determine the extent of foreign influence in our elections and create safeguards to ensure it never happens again.
How long will they continue failing to hold the president accountable and punting on securing real reforms to protect the integrity of our democracy?
Did my colleagues simply bury their heads in the sand as our President cozied up to Vladamir #Putin in #Helsinki, where he took this dictator's word regarding #RussianHacking over that of our nation’s intelligence community?
Thank you @WhipHoyer for highlighting the desperate need to safeguard our democracy. It's unconscionable &amp; scary that @HouseGOP failed to support increased funds for election security. Are they blind to the ever-growing pile of evidence of #Russian interference in our elections? https://t.co/krg5wirNnU
In the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn't a privilege, it's a necessity – for job-seekers, small businesses and many others. That's why I signed a discharge petition that would force the GOP to hold a vote in the House on legislation to restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/L8pfqhgjzP
Today, and every day, we honor these brave women who organized and mobilized on behalf of #GenderEquality. Their hard work paved the way for rights and opportunities for millions of women, but the fight is far from over. 170 years later, we must remain committed to this cause. https://t.co/TaTE84zLPZ
This reprieve is temporary, but still a big win in our fight to block @EPA's crusade to put more "super-polluting" trucks on our roads. Though #GOP leaders refused even to consider my measure nullifying this effort, we will continue using our collective power to stop it for good. https://t.co/NpnfX7rTub
The @ProChoiceCaucus, which I co-chair, is working hard to #StopKavanaugh. This August, our members will take the fight to our districts, where we'll help amplify the voices of people across America who know how dangerous his confirmation would be for #reprorights. https://t.co/NRnXErkwwM
Trump's NATO meeting and his performance in #Helsinki with #Putin were shocking; his effort to walk back his comments, pathetic. #GOP leaders need to accept what the rest of America already knows: he's just not capable of being president. From SiriusXM’s @MorningBriefing: https://t.co/FBZD4Zl9We
On @MorningBriefing, I discussed the need to hold #Trump accountable for his pathetic meeting with #Putin and to stop the confirmation of his #SCOTUS nominee, #BrettKavanaugh, who could roll back #reprorights and access to health care for millions. Listen: https://t.co/NYOB0uCFdh
About to talk about  #Trump’s pathetic performance with PutIn &amp; his latest comments, as well as #WhatsAtStake concerning #Kavanaugh and #SCOTUS, with @SXMPOTUS. Tune in!
A big congratulations to @Rockies All-Stars @Chuck_Nazty, @colorados3B, and @Tstory2! We’ll be cheering you on tonight at the @MLB #AllStarGame ⚾️
I have and will continue to do everything in my power to hold this President and his administration to account for these and the myriad other abuses perpetrated by the administration since January of last year, and I welcome your thoughts on what steps to take next.
This is why I support @RepJerryNadler’s Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act. https://t.co/14Ijzbxn3u
This is why I called out the President when it came to light that he attempted to fire Special Counsel Mueller. https://t.co/fGGeg5jvcA
This is why I voted to impose sanctions on Russia for interfering in our elections and then joined my colleagues in calling out the President for failing to implement those sanctions.   https://t.co/CFUygOpD5F
This is why I called on the Department of Justice to appoint a Special Counsel early last year. https://t.co/ibO5KqEFRX
As clear as mud. When you get caught carrying the Kremlin’s water, after-the-fact corrections carry no weight. I’ve called for this President to be held to task for his words and actions, as well as the Russians for meddling in our elections – and I’ll continue to do so. https://t.co/wWMp3MNl5w
These experts recognize the danger of #ScottPruitt’s move to put more super-polluting trucks on our roads. I proposed a measure to put a stop to that, but #GOP leaders have just refused even to consider it. Instead, they're supporting his sneak attack on public health. Shameful. https://t.co/3VVacb3WWe
.@HouseCommerce #GOP in the Environment Subcommittee voted to advance a bill that makes it easier for polluters to harm low-income communities such as Elyria-Swansea &amp; Globeville. I spoke against it &amp; will continue fighting to keep it from becoming law. https://t.co/xSsCOklmg4
This morning I joined Leader @NancyPelosi, members of the @ProChoiceCaucus and #reprorights advocates to reaffirm our commitment to #StopKavanaugh. If appointed, Trump's #SCOTUS pick will work to overturn abortion rights, gut the #ACA and give @POTUS more unchecked power. https://t.co/kkUJNrHyWL
We can't continue to let outdated and cumbersome regulatory processes jeopardize our families' health. That's why Congress must pass my bipartisan bill giving @FDA new tools to more effectively review over-the-counter drugs. I spoke in support of it tonight on the House floor: https://t.co/545mlZI9zj
We must speed up efforts to reunite families separated under #ZeroTolerance. That's why I'm demanding a meeting with @HHSGov and @ICEgov officials, immigration stakeholders and congressional colleagues this Friday to achieve better communication and more quickly end this crisis. https://t.co/lyz1Y0DfFT
Pleased @FCC plans to scrutinize this acquisition, which could increase @WeAreSinclair's already large media influence. I’ve long been concerned @AjitPaiFCC would show favoritism toward Sinclair, &amp; raised that concern in a letter to him nearly a year ago: https://t.co/lttgwDxIGW https://t.co/QyXZpL4Cpj
DACA update: If you were granted DACA but then it was terminated by DHS, you can renew – but you have to complete an application and meet some criteria. Here’s a helpful FAQ → https://t.co/wF1w43I5Dr
Trump has, indeed, become Putin’s puppet. It is dangerous, disingenuous &amp; absurd for a U.S. president to take the word of #Putin over our intelligence community. Further, @POTUS statements undermining @FBI and shifting blame for Russian misdeeds are outrageous. #TrumpPutin https://t.co/d5rOX8ZQl5
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including working to #SaveScotus, demanding more accountability and oversight regarding #FamilySeparation, stopping "super-polluting" trucks, and celebrating progress for people living with #type1 #diabetes. https://t.co/NC5UNJbxWv
President Trump must cancel his summit with Putin in light of indictments today of 12 Kremlin-backed intelligence officials for interfering in the 2016 elections. Meeting with him now sends the signal that such actions won’t be met with consequences, and might even be rewarded. https://t.co/emcxZDn16w
I supported this resolution because it is our moral obligation to oppose this cruel Trump administration policy. America must remain open to refugees, particularly those fleeing domestic violence. https://t.co/hWUo6kjPiT
After receiving @JDRF's Trailblazer Award this morning for my work fighting #type1 diabetes, it was great to again see Colorado members of the organization who were at the ceremony. They stopped by my DC office, where I commended their advocacy in our Colorado communities. https://t.co/TnYxHJA0nz
The #ACA guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, and chances are you probably have one or more. Millions could lose health care coverage if those protections are invalidated by a Supreme Court ruling. That's why we must #StopKavanaugh. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/jzJdAthZ1t
.@EnergyCommerce Dems are demanding answers on the Trump Admin #familyseparation campaign, but #GOP members are blocking our effort, claiming the committee has already conducted thorough oversight. I won’t let them shirk their duty; this committee needs to do its job. https://t.co/0EvSu5Uqmj
At a @HouseCommerce markup, I expressed support for a resolution demanding answers about Trump's #familyseparation campaign, which I saw first-hand on a trip to the border. #GOP committee leaders must join Dems' unified call for oversight of this shameful, self-inflicted crisis. https://t.co/ZDiG5BQui0
Thanks to @JDRF for honoring me with its Trailblazer Award for my work fighting #type1 diabetes. As co-chair of the Diabetes Caucus, this effort is personal, and I'll continue working to expand access to treatment and find cures that will one day put JDFR out of business. https://t.co/rFwjYDECzr
Great meeting w/ CO. @CleanAirMoms for a wide-ranging discussion about the fight in Congress to secure environmental justice, stop pollution, mitigate #climatechange and reunite separated families at the border. Meeting these goals will be tough, but moms always get the job done. https://t.co/JaVS0D9lWS
Members of @NeverAgainCO are working to end #gunviolence, ensure fairer policing and create dialogue among diverse communities about their goals. Today, several of these amazing young people visited DC, where I reaffirmed my support for their efforts and gave them an office tour. https://t.co/jhOUzgpiTQ
@MsReginaFilangi I abhor violence and condemn in the strongest terms possible any such threats. https://t.co/T0f6cac8oI
.@TheJusticeDept and @DHSgov are telling asylum-seeking families to choose between separation and detention, an outrageous choice created by @RealDonaldTrump. There are humane alternatives, and we won't let this administration deny them to these families.
I’m moving to block #ScottPruitt’s sneak attack on the environment that would put more super-polluting trucks on the road. This attack on our air, issued after he quit but before he left, is part of his ongoing legacy that we must stop. https://t.co/YbqGUTzTCj https://t.co/xScxLNFgkp
The Trump admin. isn't meeting today's court-ordered deadline to reunite all children under 5 with their parents. A just-filed status report confirms this shameful failure, along with heartbreaking details about children affected. #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/dJwXFGFW7t https://t.co/vLfP4nsDeM
President Trump has said women should face “punishment” for exercising their constitutional right to abortion. Now, with Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, this nightmare could become a reality. We must #StopKavanaugh and protect women’s right to choose. #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/3p0gNajPzQ
.@SecAzar is reportedly asking for volunteers to help with @HHSGov's efforts to #ReuniteFamilies, which must be completed by July 26. Really?? It's up to this admin. to right their own wrongs, and I sent him a letter demanding a plan of action to do this. https://t.co/VKOHJhrH7c https://t.co/dqpW6cl6NX
President Trump and every one of his cronies who spearheaded the cruel #familyseparation campaign should be made to look these 38 children in the eyes and tell them they may never see their parents again. We can't let this happen. We won't rest until these families are reunited. https://t.co/AvLfeDlgr5
This study linking air pollution and #diabetes is the sort of important public health research that the @EPA is trying to ignore through its science transparency rule introduced by #ScottPruitt. We must continue fighting the agency's regressive agenda. https://t.co/wGAXov2F6G
Women have made incredible progress towards equality thanks to #RoeVWade - in the workplace, in society, in communities and in families. Abortion rights are an essential freedom, and we know #WhatsAtStake. This #SCOTUS vacancy shouldn't be used to strip women’s rights.
The resignation of @EPAScottPruitt is welcome news. His myriad scandals disgraced @EPA's legacy, but his greatest scheme -- the assault on our environment through the agency, is likely to continue under his successor. We must continue pushing back. https://t.co/5TNb2VA8XO https://t.co/uQEaNylHPt
Happy #FourthofJuly! Though our 242-year-old nation is currently facing unprecedented challenges, I know the activism in our community in defense of its ideals will ensure we emerge stronger and more principled than ever before. Enjoy this special day and God bless America. https://t.co/GhwtVIz2aS
In @denverpost I’m sharing what I saw during my trip last weekend to the U.S. border and an @ICEgov detention facility in Aurora. It’s clear from what I witnessed that we must do better as a nation to reunite families and treat all migrants with dignity. https://t.co/P5QdtXGSzw
Today, principled individuals in our community and many others across America are taking to the streets and uniting to declare: #FamiliesBelongTogether. Victims of #FamilySeparation are counting on us to keep up this vital activism until all are reunited. We won't let them down. https://t.co/CYxlrzljHm
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including sharing details from my recent trip to the U.S. border, laying out my plan to reunite families and achieve immigration reform, responding to #SCOTUS rulings and wishing you a happy #FourthofJuly. https://t.co/6blRpLVdo3
#AnthonyKennedy's retirement from #SCOTUS puts our precarious #reprorights in grave danger. One more anti-choice justice could tip this already-divided court, hampering women's health for generations. We can't let Trump and his GOP allies get their way. https://t.co/5CViU4rq9A https://t.co/gaWPWES16V
The #Janus decision strikes a major blow to public sector employees and will undermine teachers, police officers, firefighters and countless others who serve our community. We must continue to fight for strong workplace rights and fair working conditions for all Americans. https://t.co/12E8B81VN5
#NetNeutrality protects small businesses and innovators in our community by ensuring they have a level playing field online. The Trump @FCC’s repeal has gut those protections. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/JtzmH5Hnq0
Because of #NIFLAvBecerra, crisis pregnancy centers will be able to intentionally mislead, confuse, and misinform women about their health care options. What a disgrace. #EndTheLies https://t.co/OkDH4nD2Gb
It's a dark and shameful day in this country when the highest court in the land refuses to condemn the bigotry on display in Trump's #MuslimBan. While I respect #SCOTUS' authority, I am horrified by its decision and will continue working to end this terrible policy. https://t.co/eXEAPMQ9ze
More details from my visit to the U.S. border and Aurora's @ICEgov detention facility this weekend. The parents and children I met, caught in the ongoing #FamilySeparation crisis, are people, not pawns – and our president needs to understand that. https://t.co/0jB7sOcyIM
This weekend, I heard heartbreaking stories directly from mothers and fathers whose children were ripped away as they sought refuge in this country. We must ensure the injustices they’ve faced are not in vain. We must reunite families and change our laws. https://t.co/0ABUsOu59D
That "long and complicated legal process" is called #DueProcess, and it's a cornerstone of our #democracy – the very reason people have long sought refuge here. President Trump’s startling lack of basic constitutional knowledge, as well as empathy, is extremely concerning. https://t.co/7sKyXn888s
Five years ago, #SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, and since then, more than two dozen states have enacted laws making it harder to register and cast a ballot. Congress must pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to stop this trend. https://t.co/DY8BDoKQjm
On @KOANewsRadio, I spoke to @AprilZesbaugh and @ContactLenz_KOA about what I gleaned from my fact finding trips this weekend to the U.S. border in Texas and the @ICEgov detention facility in Aurora as part of my ongoing efforts to end #FamilySeparation. Take a listen: https://t.co/Olk9yWhXn8
At today’s #SaveTheChildren rally at the CO. State Capitol, I encouraged my fellow Coloradans to keep up the fight to end #FamilySeparation. My trip to the border this weekend and the passion for justice exhibited by my constituents have strengthened my resolve to achieve this. https://t.co/FxLpZBDc0Y
More of my proposals to address the current immigration crisis. https://t.co/A1XMga8n0f
I met with several bereft refugees at the Aurora detention center. They deserve far better than to be treated this way for seeking asylum in the USA - shattered families, unacceptably long waits under lock and key. Here are some of my proposals to address these issues and more. https://t.co/cCTB4l7677
Parents w/ kids ripped away under the Trump #FamilySeparation campaign are at the ICE detention center here. The trauma continues as they await reunion; even then they’ll remain confined while their asylum cases are considered. I’m going to hear and help them tell their stories. https://t.co/b40FvBvzeR
Today at the U.S.-Mexico border, I saw 45 refugee women who had been separated from their children, people waiting desperately to enter our country to seek refuge, and children as young as nine months in detention. Here’s what I plan to do about it: https://t.co/7zTfSFrVlS
At the Gateway International Bridge in Brownsville, Texas, speaking with people waiting to cross the border. Many have been waiting hours and even days make this short journey to seek asylum. We can protect our borders while also allowing refugees — a basic human right. https://t.co/Um48hkM1yF
Headed to Brownsville, the next stop on our visit to the border, where we’re witnessing  effects of Trump’s #FamilySeparation policy. His vague order this week has no provisions for reuniting shattered #refugee families and will still keep them locked up illegally. Disgraceful. https://t.co/SFg1XAb8c5
The Trump admin. is failing so far to reunite families ripped apart through its “zero-tolerance” policy. Here on my trip to the U.S. border in McAllen, Texas, I’m calling for the creation of a special Czar to oversee reunification efforts and bring families together faster. https://t.co/vuKZk4jg5x
Our delegation to the US. border is gathering to traverse the path of refugees, including those traumatized by #FamilySeparation. We’ll shine a spotlight, bear witness and keep pressure on @POTUS to work on a quick, comprehensive solution to the crisis he caused. More tomorrow. https://t.co/q6ImztCFaD
As I head to the U.S. border, here’s an update on my work to end refugee #FamilySeparation &amp; ensure family reunification, including sponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, demanding @SecNielsen's resignation, calling for hearings on the crisis and more. https://t.co/wyClsbBBCm
The Trump Administration has been disturbingly silent on the whereabouts and treatment of migrant girls separated from their families. What are they hiding? #WhereAreTheGirls? https://t.co/HZxlwWpKpk
We're using every available means to ensure that refugees traumatized by Trump’s cruel #FamilySeparation policy are reunited and that there is clarity about the condition and whereabouts of the more than 2,000 children victimized by this national disgrace. https://t.co/48YGG3fSVv
This crisis is far from over. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, then return to working on a comprehensive solution to our country’s broken immigration system. My full statement: https://t.co/YPJ5wsG4Bs
This weekend, I will travel with congressional colleagues to the Southwest U.S. border to observe detention centers there and to meet with detainees. This Executive Order has changed nothing for them, and it won't erase their pain.
2,300 children - from toddlers to teens - have been separated from their parents. Did the administration ever have any concrete plans to eventually reunite them? This Executive Order doesn’t even lay out a framework, which makes this situation even more tragic.
Keeping asylee families in cages on charges that might not even apply to them is evil. We are a nation of laws, not some arbitrarily cruel authoritarian regime. Coming into this country without documentation is at worst a misdemeanor that does not call for ripping families apart.
I call on all people of conscience across America to continue pushing Trump toward a more just and complete solution to the refugee crisis he created that hasn't been solved through his order - which was too little, too late.
Trump’s belated Executive Order ending #FamilySeparation doesn't truly end it, since this vague order does nothing to reverse the damage his cruel campaign has inflicted. Children and their parents remain behind fences, locked doors and even the gates of military bases.
I joined nearly 60 House Dem. women in sending a letter to @SecAzar and @SecNielsen asking: #WhereAreTheGirls &amp; very young children who have been separated at the border? The admin. has provided disturbingly little info on their whereabouts &amp; well-being. https://t.co/UWqxPagGND https://t.co/eyxWhHoa7m
This had to be deliberate. https://t.co/QgBQyJ92Up
Americans have placed tremendous pressure on @POTUS to end #FamilySeparation; our advocacy is working. We must keep it up to ensure follow-through and reunite these families, and move on to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/YLnVjqcZCC
We've raised the alarm about #FamilySeparation many times w/high Trump officials. On Friday, noting @EnergyCommerce colleagues share these concerns, I called for hearings. Today we made that official. More: https://t.co/R6dpA7m8qi https://t.co/UH2oPk36JD
Today we recognize people fleeing persecution and war. In previous years, I've reflected on America's role in helping them, but now our country is creating a refugee crisis of our own. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether at our border, especially those seeking asylum. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/wQlPX936dK
Joined fellow @HouseDemocrats, leading immigration advocates and a group of children, symbolic of those being ripped from their parents, to demand an end to #FamilySeparation at the U.S. border. @POTUS can stop this cruelty at any time. Why won't he? #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pTBPR4yjwg
.@SecNielsen must resign or be fired from her position at @DHSgov over #FamilySeparation and her repeated lies and misrepresentations about the policy. Her lack of understanding of the law and total insensitivity to these families make her unfit to serve. https://t.co/5mrOh65vtA https://t.co/jf0DtGWiU1
Today we introduced the Keep Families Together Act, HR 6135. It will stop @DHSgov from continuing the inhumane new #FamilySeparation campaign, which further traumatizes vulnerable children and their parents and is rightly being met with outrage worldwide. https://t.co/wYsPP3BekJ https://t.co/f0pzLnUqaY
More from @KOANewsRadio: The #FamilySeparation crisis and the fight to #ProtectDreamers are both symptoms of our broken immigration system. There is widespread support for bipartisan reform, but we must first unite to overcome a president and his dangerous immigration agenda. https://t.co/fHSrBCI1j9
The Trump admin. is using vulnerable children as pawns in its fear campaign against immigrants and efforts to secure funding for a wasteful border wall. Meanwhile, families are being ripped apart by this startling lack of empathy. Hear more from my interview with @KOANewsRadio: https://t.co/8PXEE9PPQw
On @KOANewsRadio, I laid out why I oppose the cruel Trump #FamilySeparation campaign and spoke about my upcoming trip to the border to witness it first-hand. This is another result of the #GOP's refusal to pass immigration reform, and it can't continue. https://t.co/1a0K5HFJoU
.@POTUS new #familyseparation campaign is inhumane. I’ll travel w/ 20+ other leaders to see the scene of this crime against humanity, how it harms vulnerable people and damages our nation’s stature. Must keep the pressure on to end this shameful chapter. https://t.co/2yNpoxtfm6
I've long worked to end @POTUS' heinous "zero-tolerance" policy that is causing #FamilySeparation. This weekend, I will travel to the U.S - Mexico border in McAllen, TX to meet with those affected and further highlight why this cruelty must end. https://t.co/IaaiY1SvLn https://t.co/rvQqRmsq7n

Big development in the effort to #BootPruitt: Government’s top ethics official tells @EPAgov Inspector General to expand current inquiries &amp; get to the bottom of @EPAScottPruitt’s ethics messes so he can consider recommending disciplinary steps to @POTUS. https://t.co/s56BM80azS
#FamilySeparation at the border is inhumane. I support the Keep Families Together Act, to be introduced next week. It will bar @DHSgov from separating kids from their parents except in very narrow, extraordinary circumstances - with independent oversight. The cruelty must end. https://t.co/dWJ2zboL6Y
At a @HouseCommerce hearing with senior Trump administration appointees today, I highlighted the heinous practice of #FamilySeparation at the border. Committee Dems will soon send a letter to the chairman to call for a hearing on the topic, which is simply too inhumane to ignore. https://t.co/FdSmrpZLYB
One more day in DC, including a key hearing on public health – stay tuned for more on that – and House votes on the hazard of imported synthetic drugs. Then it’s back home to Colorado after a busy week here. Sign up for my newsletter to read all about it! https://t.co/q4toLUqO62
It’s not the @Rockies, but it’s great once again to be at the #CongressionalBaseballGame with members of Team DeGette cheering on my fellow Democrats.

The findings in the #IGreport are troubling, but it’s important to know that they have nothing to do with the #RussiaInvestigation. The report also doesn’t show any bias within the @FBI or any “deep state” in favor of Hillary Clinton. #WeDemandTheTruth https://t.co/C5zJz6kPBo
At a @HouseCommerce hearing on protecting chemical facilities from terrorism, I questioned experts about measures to safeguard nearby residents against toxic emissions from these facilities, including @Suncor's refinery near Elyria-Swansea, a potential hazard for thousands. https://t.co/Iaa6s9QAHA
I support @RepBarbaraLee’s RESPECT resolution because it will help right a long-standing wrong. The war on drugs has devastated communities of color; we must ensure training and job opportunities in the legal #marijuana industry are open for all Americans. https://t.co/dnC2ZIRPDQ
Wonderful seeing @believeEan of @COLatinoForum while he's here in DC. We discussed the importance of risk management plans for industrial facilities such as @Suncor's facility in Elyria-Swansea, along with other environmental justice issues that are important to our region. https://t.co/sJykQW2KyE
Happy to meet with Tara Prendergast and Lydia Waligorski, who are both helping to aid @CCADV1's mission of ending domestic violence in Colorado. Strengthening lifelines such as #VOCA and #VAWA will also help put a stop to this horrific abuse in our state and across America. https://t.co/8kLuQXZQLZ
Denying asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence is just plain wrong. I'm wearing a #PurpleRibbon today to express my opposition to this new policy by @POTUS and AG Sessions This country must remain a haven to those in desperate need of safety and security. https://t.co/MhDLVOJF3f
Colorado members of @CWAUnion are visiting Washington. They're rightly concerned about the #GOPTaxScam's harmful effects on working families who are struggling to get by. My fellow Democrats and I are pushing back, offering #ABetterDeal for all Americans. https://t.co/80lNyMObTL
Though @HouseGOP leaders have ensured the failure of our discharge petition to bring immigration bills such as the #DreamAct up for a vote, it's not the end of our fight. I'll continue working to pass smart policies that #ProtectDreamers and safeguard families. https://t.co/iDvfFlneCe
Good news for those w/diabetes who are on #Medicare: You can now link continuous glucose monitors to cell phones/tablets without concern about losing federal benefits. @RepTomReed &amp; I teamed up to get this change made. It will help 300K people nationwide. https://t.co/rzr08INzWY
Chick-fil-A staff don’t work on Sundays, but it seems @EPAScottPruitt and his staff were working overtime on the taxpayer dime to get his wife a job there or, as we’re now learning, with high-dollar donors or at a conservative dark money group.

Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers denied coverage for many people with these #PreExistingConditions. That changed with the #ACA, but @POTUS' choice not to defend this protection in court could take us back to those dark days. We can’t let it happen. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/Yk089fCZ3e

A new low in @POTUS ongoing sabotage of the #ACA: His Justice Department won’t defend key provisions of the law guaranteeing coverage even for pre-existing conditions. Millions rely on this life-saving coverage. We must continue fighting to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/qCTqMmnigD

This is 3.6 million kids too many. More troubling is that e-cigarettes and cigars were some of the most commonly used tobacco products among adolescents. Another good reason to ban flavors in these products, which I urged in a letter I led to @US_FDA. https://t.co/C5AGQeXPPl https://t.co/cQIbKYj0lo
The poster boys for western conservatism?

Gut-wrenching: “Since his arrival in Michigan, family members said, a day has not gone by when the boy has failed to ask in Spanish, ‘When will I see my papa?’ They tell him the truth. They do not know. No one knows.”  This is simply inhumane.  https://t.co/pTPoj0rQWO

The Trump administration will stop at nothing to undermine women’s health. Its proposed rule on #TitleX, expected later today, has one purpose: to limit women’s access to care. It shows a callous disregard for the wellbeing of American women and families. https://t.co/OOPsP1eoaE
The #GOPFarmBill will kick 400,000 U.S. households off of #SNAP, so don’t believe the Republican claims that not a single person will lose benefits. This is just one reason I'm opposing this damaging, partisan spending bill that undermines farmers and families. https://t.co/T2cbezoolT
On #IDAHOT, we celebrate the global #LGBTQ community and recognize the work that remains to ensure their full equality around the world. Too many are justifiably fearful of living openly, facing social and legal barriers to this right. We support them on this day and every day. https://t.co/C7bsTWePa3
The future of the internet is at stake in our fight against the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality. But there's good news: Senate Dems vote today to #SaveTheInternet.  I’m supporting the same legislation here in the House that will bring #NetNeutrality back. https://t.co/YpFE1mQrzf https://t.co/RmglxgH5B4
Wishing a #RamadanKareem to all celebrating this important commemoration in Colorado, across America and around the world. May you grow closer to your faith, your values and your loved ones during this special time. https://t.co/xr5PS9xwuE
Every day, &gt;820 women in developing countries die due to childbirth-related complications, including #UnsafeAbortion. The #GlobalGagRule harms women in under-resourced communities, placing lifesaving #ReproHealth services out of reach. I'm working to end this policy for good. https://t.co/RZMTVR0vHn
I led more than 200 of my colleagues in sending a letter to @SecAzar opposing a proposed #TitleX domestic gag rule. This edict would prevent providers from receiving Title X funds if they even mention abortion to their patients. This is unconscionable. https://t.co/2VvlhrJOMZ https://t.co/so3uvEo3EO
I filed a comment to @BetsyDeVosED opposing @usedgov's delay of Equity in IDEA, which seeks to address disparities in the treatment of students of color. This gap is present in Denver public schools, and we must work to end it nationwide, despite @POTUS' attacks on these efforts. https://t.co/LlV7hCF52m
Today we lost a dedicated public servant, seasoned leader, and good friend to many. Condolences to the loved ones of Mayor Stephen D. Hogan, a Colorado original who will be deeply missed.
Happy #MothersDay! Our job isn't always easy, but the hard work is worth it as we love, nurture and instill good values in our kids. Thanks to my own mother who lives on through the lessons she taught me, and to my daughters. Being their mom remains my greatest joy of my life. https://t.co/q0fq5LLrGH
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including opposing @POTUS' #IranDeal decision, advancing legislation to improve public health, fighting #opioids, opposing #budgetcuts, taking action on local priorities, and celebrating #MothersDay. https://t.co/7v3vExj7XR
Pleased to work w/@RepTomReed on a bipartisan bill we've introduced to expand #Medicare coverage for #diabetes self-care training. With it, beneficiaries will learn techniques for managing and coping with this complex disease’s effects. Read the bill here: https://t.co/Pf0nfMMcqO
.@POTUS' #drugprices proposal contains some good ideas, such as providing free generic drugs to seniors, but in true Trump fashion, offers flash with little substance. His #GOPTaxScam handed pharmaceutical companies a huge tax break, and this plan gives back little to consumers.
Today I convened a meeting with local stakeholders to address high lead levels in drinking water in some Denver homes caused by corrosion of lead pipes. Our productive discussion brings us a step closer to fixing this public health threat. https://t.co/KYVri1pDMa
What moms need: Quality, coordinated, woman-centered #healthcare. What #momsdontneed: Continued attacks on the #ACA, #Medicaid and Planned Parenthood. @POTUS and the GOP Congress should remember this on #MothersDay and every day. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/yLmkfbOhJe
As leader of the @ProChoiceCaucus, I #ActForWomen every day in part by championing smart legislation such as the Women's Health Protection Act. We must ensure that women are protected from anti-choice politicians in all 50 states. https://t.co/Ydr7t2LKP4
#Reprorights are a priority for most Americans, and yet they’re under siege by the Trump admin. and congressional GOP. As @SecAzar prepares to testify in the Senate today, I joined @PPFA leaders, senators and fellow House members in decrying @HHSgov attacks on women’s rights. https://t.co/yVVaCyITC9
Today @HouseGOP refused to address the price of prescription drugs. Meanwhile, Americans continue to suffer under crippling costs. That’s a raw deal. The American people deserve #ABetterDeal on this priority and many more. https://t.co/iMyGZ7drZX
While my Democratic colleagues and I work for greater protections &amp; services for student loan borrowers - 776,000 in Colorado alone - this administration shuns them to serve corporate interests. The next generation deserves better: We should set them up for success, debt-free. https://t.co/JvQ97uZLVE
The @FCC took away a free and open Internet. Today, Senate Democrats are one step closer to forcing a vote to #SaveTheInternet. I’m supporting legislation here in the House that will bring #NetNeutrality back.  We must ensure equity for all online. https://t.co/ef0aW7mKNG
Needless delays in bringing safe over-the-counter medicines to market will soon be a thing of the past, now that @HouseCommerce has passed my bipartisan bill streamlining the way @US_FDA reviews such medicines (H.R. 5333). Now let's make it law. https://t.co/APQf4tlIZ7 https://t.co/aehFTAk7lR
While @POTUS and his Cabinet live the high life, he's asking the #GOP Congress to strip $15 billion from programs that help the vulnerable, such as #CHIP and public housing support. This heartless administration asks everyone to sacrifice except the president and his cronies. https://t.co/FWtljYMT8m
Today, I was pleased to meet with a group of Colorado members of @NationalNurses. They're visiting Washington to advocate for #MedicareForAll and better workplace safety, both of which will improve our health care system for patients and those who care for them. #NursesWeek https://t.co/7vOxujZS2l
.@POTUS' #sanctions announcement is a setback both for U.S. international leadership and global stability. The #IranDeal is designed to maintain the goal of a non-nuclear #Iran; we shouldn’t break our obligations now, but should instead work w/ other countries toward that goal. https://t.co/oHxR51trwz
Weeks after giving tax breaks to the wealthy through the #GOPTaxScam, the #Trumpbudget was released; it guts housing benefits for families struggling to pay rent. This is wrong, plain and simple. Affordable housing is a right. #OurHomesOurVoices #CutsHurt https://t.co/8SqVxTwynp
The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, where I serve as ranking member, is questioning #opioid pill distributors to determine the root causes of egregious pill dumping in WV. We need answers to aid similar investigations in Colorado and to end #opioid abuse for good. https://t.co/VpE9DBm3yy
On #TeacherAppreciationDay, I thank every educator, including my late mother, who has chosen to educate and inspire people of every age. But our gratitude isn't enough. We must ensure teachers have the tools they need to help their students succeed. We can do much more. https://t.co/mk1g1KEXs7
Tune in as I hold major drug distributors accountable at this morning’s hearing on #opioid dumping in WVa, #Colorado and other states. What did they know, and when? Why didn’t they report suspiciously large orders to @DEAHQ &amp; @TheJusticeDept as required? https://t.co/fzDsXYSDzL
In a desperate effort to appear fiscally responsible, @POTUS is urging his #GOP allies to sacrifice health care for children from low-income homes. It’s an attack on the most vulnerable among us. We must fight to save #CHIP from this cruel chopping block. https://t.co/yC40QAqkHi
I sent a letter to @EPAScottPruitt demanding more information on his shady real estate transactions in Oklahoma and Washington. Recent reports show he left out vital details on these shady dealings when I questioned him about them last week. #BootPruitt https://t.co/RKA5v7rpd5 https://t.co/vleQO0fLDn
I've requested local, state and federal stakeholders join me on May 11 for a meeting to determine the best plan of action to lower lead levels in Denver’s drinking water. Corrosive pipes are the culprit, and we need to fix this quickly to protect public health. https://t.co/wfVirpHDTI

Disheartened that Chuck Plunkett has resigned as editorial page editor of the @denverpost. He’s always been a real pro. Throughout the paper's recent struggles, he has offered a brave and passionate voice in defense of good journalism. We hear you, Chuck. #pressfreedom
Great to again gather with African American leaders in our community for a wide-ranging lunch discussion. We'll keep working together to achieve progress on equitable health care, #gunsafety, discrimination, voting rights, affordable housing and more despite #GOP opposition. https://t.co/ESThOwt5fY
I grilled @EPAScottPruitt on his ethical lapses last week, and now more are piling up. @EnergyCommerce colleagues and I today sent him a letter demanding answers regarding his landlord's alleged influence on critical @EPA appointments. https://t.co/KA1R3jxaWj https://t.co/aDUAiyyvsC
On #WorldPressFreedomDay , I enjoyed meeting with reporters and editors from a variety of local community papers to answer their questions about my work in Congress. It was a productive discussion, and I thank them for their important work keeping Coloradans informed. https://t.co/PZlTNOVxHL
I'm sharing highlights from Tuesday's live telephone town hall. In this clip, I speak about what it will take to pass a #climatechange bill in Congress. GOP leadership has blocked this effort, but I've been building coalitions to ensure action is taken if Dems win back the House. https://t.co/4bbTeOx4FN
What a wonderful night celebrating @parkhillnews and its staff. Since 1961, this paper has helped create a more vibrant community in Denver's Park Hill neighborhood while keeping residents informed. Today, on #WorldPressFreedomDay, and every day, it's worth supporting. https://t.co/thraOleSDV
Today I joined experts from @CO_CDHS and @SwedishMedical to discuss the federal response to the #opioid crisis. Many hospitals want to give patients an alternative to opioids from the start, and my bipartisan bill, H.R. 5197, can aid in this effort. https://t.co/c69GZZxH3R
May is #AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth, an occasion to celebrate this diverse and dynamic group of Americans numbering more than 22 million.

.@EPA’s announcement today that our region is out of compliance with ozone standards set in 2015 is only a first step toward reducing pollution. The agency also needs to stop attacking important protections such as like the Clean Power Plan. Air quality affects us all. https://t.co/XEzMduZzLZ
Today's lunch with local Latino leaders covered a lot of ground, including our work on protecting #Dreamers, securing voting rights, job creation, affordable housing, and access to health care and higher education - all vital priorities for this fast-growing group of Coloradans.
Congratulations to the Children's Museum of Denver on winning @US_IMLS' 2018 National Medal for Museum and Library Service. From its humble roots on a converted school bus 45 years ago, it has grown into a world-class institution that makes learning exciting and fun. https://t.co/cjjdWJ2mqU

On @CecileRichards' last day as head of @PPFA, I'm recalling the many years we've spent together in the trenches fighting for women's health. #ReproRights remain under siege, but she leaves the organization strong enough to fight these attacks and win. #ThankYouCecile.

Great news! The House just passed my legislation giving airports greater ability to develop their non-federal property, as long as it doesn't hinder FAA efforts to operate them safely and efficiently. Removing this red tape helps airports raise revenue and improve infrastructure.
I asked @EPAScottPruitt about some of his shady dealings at an @EnergyCommerce hearing. He tried to dodge these questions, but I wouldn't let him get away with it. It's Congress' duty to hold fellow public servants accountable when they betray the public trust. #BootPruitt https://t.co/ydPVS8cPXN
.@EPAScottPruitt’s ethical lapses continue to pile up. @USGAO concluded EPA broke the law in constructing Pruitt’s $43,000 “privacy booth.” I just questioned him at @EnergyCommerce, and will keep working to hold him accountable for the shady dealings under his watch. #BootPruitt https://t.co/7nQfZF8ofz
Good to see these folks giving @EPAScottPruitt a warm welcome as he arrives at Capitol Hill. He's testifying before the @EnergyCommerce committee, and my Democratic colleagues and I plan to get answers from him about his many ethical lapses. #BootPruitt https://t.co/0zmsZK8IDR
GOP @HouseCommerce leaders are attempting to remedy their slow response to the #opioid epidemic by hastily marking up more than 60 bills. They should look to #21stCenturyCures as a model for thorough, bipartisan policymaking that can save lives – not this mad-dash approach. https://t.co/p7bHCSjHuS
Newly-released data from @usedgov reveals that African American students are disproportionately disciplined in Denver public schools, further contributing to the cycle of racism. The district is working to reverse this trend, but more must be done. https://t.co/DuL5RlXpoe
Vive la science! @EmmanuelMacron
#SCOTUS has the opportunity to strike down @POTUS' discriminatory #MuslimBan for good. I hope they heed the warnings of countless Americans, refugees and national security experts who have long said this unlawful, heartless edict isn't making us any safer. https://t.co/xF7imVEJ55
Thanks @MelMcIntire and @RollCall for a good discussion of how this country can achieve quality, affordable health care for all. There are potential bipartisan solutions to the high cost of care, including rising drug prices; it will take political will to see them through.

.@US_FDA's crackdown on the sale of e-cigs to minors is a good start, but the agency should also ban the manufacture of all flavored e-cigs, which often get kids on the path to addiction. I'm already working to ensure the agency makes this necessary move. https://t.co/BIBCA6JezG https://t.co/xKJhCjnDG4
Thanks to members of @PanCANColorado for meeting at my Denver office yesterday to share your personal #PancreaticCancer stories and urge further federal investment in fighting the disease.

The #GOPTaxScam In Action:   Step 1) Republicans cut taxes on corporations and the ultra-wealthy   Step 2) Shareholders then vote to give the ultra-wealthy executives an additional pay raise    Step 3) They profit twice while the middle class suffers   https://t.co/yBiH0r1nRD
Congress should strengthen Pell Grants so fewer students are reliant on loans. Unfortunately, the #TrumpBudget cuts grants and makes it more difficult for student borrowers to pay back their loans. #StandwithStudents https://t.co/ay8gS1BqBk

At a meeting with community leaders working in #refugee resettlement, I spoke about my ongoing work in Congress to push back on @POTUS' anti-refugee policies. The efforts of this group must be supported to ensure our state and nation remain a beacon for displaced peoples. https://t.co/LSVp6Qzze6
Today is the 8th anniversary of the #DeepwaterHorizon oil spill. Watch my 2010 questioning of BP CEO Tony Hayward, who admits corporate negligence contributed to this disaster. Government must hold big business accountable, not cozy up to corporations. https://t.co/dDEfEebR2H
Coloradans know too well how gun violence causes suffering without end. Across our state for nearly two decades, families and communities have been traumatized time and again.

I’ve joined more than 100 House members protesting @JusticeDept plans to end two programs that provide vital legal assistance to #immigrants. This shocking move will devastate the work @RMIAN_org &amp; others do to protect due process for immigrants in CO.  https://t.co/uDGuz3R5rI
These Americans' accounts of #opioid addiction are painful, but are also vitally important in our efforts to tackle this public health emergency. While the crisis is pandemic, it can best be understood through individuals' unique but interconnected stories. https://t.co/JGMeX3Zm0p
We’re asking @HouseCommerce leaders to have @EPAScottPruitt also testify to the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, where I’m ranking member, and to ensure that he does so under oath. We can’t just take the man at his word – not anymore. https://t.co/AO2dr35Cqh
From day one, @POTUS has worked to sell our public lands to the highest bidder. Not on our watch. I led 105 of my colleagues in a letter to @SecretaryZinke demanding @BLMNational end efforts to reverse the 2016 Methane Waste Prevention rule. #CutMethane https://t.co/cZRu5JSLl0
I support @EnergyCommerce colleague @USRepKCastor's resolution calling for @EPAScottPruitt to resign. Enough is enough. For months, our committee has prompted numerous investigations into his shady actions, and the findings so far make it clear: We must #BootPruitt. https://t.co/tdazD8TxSw
At the +Dx Diagnostics Forum, I was pleased to provide an update on my efforts to improve oversight of lab diagnostics. This includes working with @RepLarryBucshon to craft #DAIA, bipartisan legislation that will overhaul federal regulation of a variety of diagnostic tests. https://t.co/gAw4LKz4IH
Wonderful news! The Every Kid Outdoors Act, our bipartisan bill giving fourth graders and their families free access to America's National Parks, has successfully passed through @NatResources today. Congress should now vote to make it law so we can get #EveryKidInAPark.
Saddened by the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a woman of wit and strength who loved her family and her country dearly. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family during this difficult time.
.@EPAScottPruitt's ethical lapses continue to mount: a free stay at @TheBroadmoor luxury resort thanks to Colorado developers whom he briefed on his many environmental rollbacks. Shady dealings such as these point to a pattern for Mr. Pruitt. https://t.co/8xmOUeI4Eg
.@EPAScottPruitt found his predecessors’ official car fell short of his standards. His fancy new model got upgrades, including bullet-resistant seat covers. @EPA now pays $839 monthly for it while the original car stays parked. Another day in the swamp. https://t.co/EitUpse0B2
The $43,000 private phone booth for @EPAScottPruitt was purchased illegally, @USGAO has found. I questioned Administrator Pruitt on this extravagance in an @EnergyCommerce hearing last year. It’s one of his many shady dealings that we’re examining. @maddow https://t.co/NAew0QnLyx

The #GOPTaxScam was not written for the middle class. In our state, the top 5% of earners get 62% of tax breaks thanks to the Republican plan. This reckless law stands to harm working families across America, on #TaxDay and every other day of the year. https://t.co/z1pUF6XMIn
Reports from @USGAO and @EPA Inspector General point to inexcusable ethical lapses in the agency under @EPAScottPruitt. It appears we can't go one day without new revelations of troubling behavior. This has to end. We must #BootPruitt. https://t.co/3QHMDaB4Ds

As founder and CEO of #Facebook, #MarkZuckerberg appears to be strangely uninformed about how little the company has been required to pay out in previous #privacy lawsuits. My questions and his answers reveal the need for a stronger regulatory framework to protect users’ data. https://t.co/COU6AeUiBw
An especially revealing moment during my line of questioning to #MarkZuckerberg. Clearly, there is no incentive for #Facebook to self-regulate and better protect consumers' personal data. Privacy violations are apparently just the cost of doing business. https://t.co/BUKhHfmOMP
In a few minutes, I'll ask tough questions of #Facebook CEO #MarkZuckerberg about what must be done to better protect personal data online. Things have to change, and not just at Facebook, to ensure everyone's safety. Watch the hearing live here: https://t.co/fzObBxX9ss https://t.co/fItKg7q5ai
I'm prepared to ask #MarkZuckerberg tough but important questions about Americans' data security when he comes before @HouseCommerce shortly. As co-chair of the Privacy Caucus, I've long been focused on this issue and expect today will be a step toward stronger safeguards.
#MarkZuckerberg testifies before @HouseCommerce tomorrow about Facebook's use and protection of personal data, and the questions to him you've submitted on my social media will help guide my own line of questioning. If you haven't already, tell me what you'd like to ask him. https://t.co/gPs2C1nTRI
On #EqualPayDay, we confront the double burden of sexism &amp; racism in the fight to achieve pay equity.

At our request, five Inspector General inquiries are taking place regarding @EPAScottPruitt's actions.

U.S. deficit is ballooning thanks largely to the #GOPTaxScam giveaway to corporations and the ultra-wealthy, plus the hastily-passed $1.3 trillion #omnibus spending bill. This week, the GOP will try to save face with a cosmetic balanced budget amendment. We're not fooled. https://t.co/vqyvMtuUYS
#Naloxone is useful to fight #opioid abuse, but it does little to end the cycle of addiction. The @Surgeon_General, @POTUS and all our leaders must do more to tackle this epidemic where it starts, instead of outsourcing emergency response to the public. https://t.co/6wGFwQ7d0x

As we reflect on the legacy of this iconic American, we thank him for making us better by boldly revealing persistent inequality and challenging us to end it. #MLK50 https://t.co/Vrb4n5iyjJ
.@EPAScottPruitt should step down or be fired. He's crossed too many ethical lines, from reckless spending to cozy relationships with industry to unusual personnel practices undermining @EPA mission and morale. I’m done asking questions. Time for him to go. https://t.co/Trei022bBu
.@EPA is rolling back standards for light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emissions &amp; fuel economy. This will boost oil consumption, increase air pollution and cost drivers more at the pump. I support the Clean and Efficient Cars Act, which would reverse @EPAScottPruitt’s rollback. https://t.co/j7N4eTxAWR
Is @EPAScottPruitt getting a sweet deal on housing at below-market rates from an energy industry lobbyist – and if so, has this influenced decisions he’s made at @EPA? I’m looking into it together with @EnergyCommerce colleagues https://t.co/Mva9uDc8T1 https://t.co/k3cWSf67f3
On #CesarChavezDay, we honor the life and legacy of this iconic leader whose efforts helped achieve economic and social justice for so many. His message still rings true as we carry on his work to empower the underrepresented in America and around the world. https://t.co/lbV5eDQFn9
Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census will suppress participation. As a result, immigrant communities will be deprived of fair representation and vital government programs for health, education and more. https://t.co/TcYqRR6WmM
On this #OpeningDay, our hope springs eternal for the @Rockies. Here’s to the start of a great season! https://t.co/y2WlFhDggF
.@EPAScottPruitt has treated himself to the high life on the taxpayers' dime while working to harm public health &amp; the environment. My @EnergyCommerce colleagues and I are investigating these reckless spending habits. Our work has prompted reviews by the EPA Inspector General. https://t.co/XhXWehar2R
35,000 people are killed every year in this country by #gunviolence, and none must be forgotten. 19 years after Daniel Mauser and 12 others were killed in Columbine, we must unite to #endgunviolence for good. For Daniel, and for every victim, we say #NeverAgain. https://t.co/zsZI9kH16K
I joined more than 100 @HouseDemocrats in sending a letter to @SecAzar demanding @HHSGov withdraw its Refusal of Care rule, which would make it easier for health care providers to discriminate against women &amp; #LGBTQ. Doctors must always #PutPatientsFirst. https://t.co/lI9ZH2Mwe4 https://t.co/etBe48k2e4
Congrats to @DenverHealthMed, which has been named an #LGBTQ Healthcare Equality Leader this year, earning a perfect score from @HRC. Hospitals must be attuned to the unique needs of their #LGBTQ patients and staff, and I commend this local health facility for leading the way. https://t.co/tGnffymVBJ
The Trump administration's move to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census is a shameless attempt to deprive immigrant communities of civil rights, fair representation, and vital gov't programs. We must fight to ensure all can stand and be counted. https://t.co/ppBtY2bx6E https://t.co/81zi2W2pwG
At @EPARegion8 headquarters in Denver today, I demanded that agency leaders halt environmental rollbacks and end their wasteful spending. While @EPAScottPruitt throws taxpayer money at flying first class, the health of Colorado's lands and its people suffer. https://t.co/d2lRYKaewY
.@Sunrun is helping fuel CO's alternative energy boom, and today I was pleased to tour their Denver design center and speak with staff about my work supporting #solarpower. This includes cosponsoring the #LiftAmericaAct and opposing @POTUS' broad tariff on imported solar panels. https://t.co/wHeYhqlxzi
Abhorrent. It’s clear @POTUS is doubling down on his bigotry to distract from his crumbling presidency. It won't work. This is the same #transban that was blocked by the courts, and we'll keep fighting to end it for good. https://t.co/Ma8t00pIyb
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including the hastily passed #omnibus, getting answers on #opioids, supporting #reprorights at #SCOTUS, celebrating #21stCenturyCures and wishing #ACA a happy eighth anniversary. https://t.co/JPf1SDMkOg
.@POTUS' appointment of @AmbJohnBolton to serve as National Security Advisor is disastrous. He could not secure Senate confirmation to become UN Ambassador in 2005, he refuses to acknowledge #Russia's meddling in our elections and he has vilified our intelligence community.
#HBD to the #AffordableCareAct, which was signed into law eight years ago today. It has weathered numerous repeal attempts by Republicans, who still work to sabotage and weaken it. But it has survived thanks to millions of Americans united to #ProtectOurCare. Let's keep it up. https://t.co/DXhuzkxdSN
The GOP-led Congress has tried many times to repeal the #ACA. Failing that, they and the President continue to sabotage the law by weakening it wherever possible rather than working with Dems to improve it. Nearly eight years on, the fight continues to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/Hl6CKD1ciS
Honored to receive the @usafmc's Statesmanship Award this evening for my bipartisan work w/ @RepFredUpton on #21stCenturyCures. Recognition from such a distinguished group of public servants speaks to the resonance of this groundbreaking law, which is already helping save lives. https://t.co/Ak2LCqBlDn
In our ongoing review of @EPAScottPruitt's luxury travel, my colleagues and I have learned that his security detail has also accompanied him on first class flights. He needs to explain this and more when he appears before @EnergyCommerce next month. https://t.co/fdgIJzradV
Kids cannot learn if they are constantly worried or fearful of discrimination. That's why I am once again cosponsoring the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which helps protect #LGBTQ students across America by prohibiting this abuse. #LetKidsLearn #SNDA https://t.co/893OvMF5AI
At @EnergyCommerce second hearing of the week on the #opioids crisis, I questioned a panel of experts representing @CDCGov, @samhsagov and @US_FDA, about ways to improve the efficacy of policies and programs meant to curb this epidemic. #21stCenturyCures is helping this mission. https://t.co/daddkHzf3w
Had a chance to catch up with two Centennial State visitors representing @NARALColorado, here in DC for a rally as oral arguments in #NIFLAvBecerra started at #SCOTUS. I’m proud to have led the amicus brief arguing for transparency and #reprorights in this case. https://t.co/4TMyayR2Ld
The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee today examined @DEAHQ's failure to keep manufacturers from shipping millions of #opioid pills to small West Virginia pharmacies. I asked agency officials how this happened. We must stop such pill dumping in WV and across the country. https://t.co/PKOOA7U5fP
#6MonthsAfterMaria #PuertoRico and its islands are still in crisis. National attention may have waned, but tens of thousands of our fellow Americans remain without permanent shelter, water or electricity. As hurricane season approaches, I'll continue working to provide relief. https://t.co/Brcmrv3wK5
15 years ago, our country invaded #Iraq, a move I opposed in one of my proudest votes in Congress. The loss of life among U.S. troops, our allies, and innocent Iraqi civilians has been far greater than anyone predicted. I pray we've learned from this costly and ongoing mistake.
Congratulations to all the Colorado Paralympians who contributed to #TeamUSA’s amazing performance – including Tyler Carron and @Nikko1515, who helped propel the U.S. sled hockey team to its third gold medal in a row. To us, you all are champions! https://t.co/fn3uXDrmYg
No matter who wins this poll, the contest that counts is coming up this Saturday. Best of luck to @DU_Hockey as our home team fights to make it to the #FrozenFour and once again claim the title of National Champions. Go Pios! https://t.co/tZfyuuMee1
Congratulations to my colleague @RepMarcyKaptur, who has just become the longest serving woman in the House of Representatives. Thank you for blazing a trail for women from all walks of life to run for office, make a difference and empower their communities. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/6zxkfN2ZDu
A wide array of Coloradans took part in today’s community forum. Among them: these young people with @BridgeProjectCO, which helps children living in Denver public housing neighborhoods achieve their dreams through access to higher education and trade schools. https://t.co/KLqg4Dumuy
Thanks to all who took part in our community forum today. We covered a lot of ground. For those who were unable to attend, the video is on my Facebook page: https://t.co/z2UUhyd1t1 https://t.co/RflXz7xxdG

In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including my efforts supporting common-sense #gunsafety reforms, promoting government transparency and keeping you informed via last Monday’s telephone town hall and this Sunday’s community forum. https://t.co/6I7C2pn2N9
The passing of my fellow @ProChoiceCaucus co-chair and colleague, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, is a tremendous loss. She was a warrior for all the issues she cared about, particularly the crusade for #reprorights. I’ll miss her wisdom and wit every day. https://t.co/2Igv8Er7O1
It's not too late to RSVP for my next community forum this Sunday. I'm looking forward to a great discussion on many issues, from the #GOPTaxScam to the battles to #ProtectDreamers, pass #gunsafety legislation and more. RSVP here -&gt; https://t.co/gPDHJhPDcb https://t.co/TXLCauAm19
Great to meet with Colorado members of @NACHC to discuss the critical importance of protecting #CHCs, #340B and #Medicaid. I’m honored to receive their Distinguished Community Health Advocate Award. I'll continue working in Congress to ensure these lifelines are strengthened. https://t.co/YRLG4EGCoC
#HBD to Supreme Court Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg, aka #NotoriousRBG, a defender of progressive values and a pioneer for women in the field of law. I've admired her since my own days as a civil rights lawyer and still find inspiration in her fierce commitment to equality. https://t.co/mhG3vVky1e
It's vital we get big money and hidden special interests out of politics, but the GOP is working to increase their influence. That's why I joined more than 100 members of Congress in opposing their actions. Government should be accountable to all people, not the privileged few. https://t.co/5VG1wOsYRr
I'm immensely proud of the students in our community and others across America who took part in #NationalWalkoutDay. Peaceful protest is a powerful means to enact lasting change. These kids were willing to get into some "good trouble," as @RepJohnLewis would say. @DPSNewsNow https://t.co/7quEv4qdWp
One month after #Parkland, I'm standing in solidarity with students in Colorado and across America protesting #gunviolence at the #EnoughIsEnough rally at the U.S. Capitol. These kids are demanding Congress buck the @NRA and pass #gunsafety legislation. We won't let them down. https://t.co/NhL68yF4V8
7,000 pairs of kids' shoes on the U.S. Capitol lawn represent the young lives lost to #gunviolence since Sandy Hook. Columbine victim Danny Mauser is also honored; his dad, Tom, wears these shoes in his memory nearly 19 years later. One month after #Parkland, we say #NeverAgain. https://t.co/eZUOAmzHBJ
During last night's telephone town hall, a caller asked how people can ensure their voice positively influences what's happening in DC. I suggest calling my office, where a real person will work to address your questions and concerns. No endless voicemail loop here. https://t.co/URh0cEkAzC
I enjoyed speaking with nearly 3,000 of you at yesterday's telephone town hall, where I answered your questions on a variety of topics, including our broken immigration system. We must ensure fair and compassionate reforms for #Dreamers and all undocumented in this country. https://t.co/flNhxUpBE4
Yesterday: Russia “clearly” behind Skripal poisoning. Today: Fired via tweet. #TillersonOut
Thanks again to the 2800 people who took part in today's tele-town hall. We covered a lot of ground; I'll share some highlights over the next couple days. In this excerpt, I discuss potential bipartisan solutions to the challenges that the U.S. health care system faces. https://t.co/sWVhcnPcx3
My telephone town hall for aging adults and their caregivers is happening now. Call in by dialing 866-383-2726 or stream and ask questions online here: https://t.co/RzOWMCNvss https://t.co/xj2ezkgrfJ
.@POTUS' refusal to hold the Russian government accountable is an outrage, setting the stage for possible future attacks on our elections in Colorado and across America. We're demanding he do his job and impose sanctions on Russia to protect the integrity of our democracy. https://t.co/rqIBLw1MKr
Today I met in Denver with representatives of the @AmDiabetesAssn and @TheEndoSociety to discuss insulin pricing. The cost of this life-saving drug is skyrocketing, &amp; I'm conducting an inquiry to find answers and solutions with my fellow Diabetes Caucus co-chair, @RepTomReed. https://t.co/FDBuJ4Yzvr
.@POTUS' infrastructure proposal would gut bedrock environmental, clean water, and clean air protections under the guise of speeding up projects. Don't be fooled by his shoddy #InfrastructureScam; we need real programs that create jobs while protecting our environment.
What's happening in Washington has significant impact in Colorado. I'm convening a community forum this Sunday, March 18, to discuss these issues and more. Your thoughts and ideas are important, and I'd love to hear them. RSVP here: https://t.co/gPDHJi7e3J https://t.co/xy0kcyUy34

Saddened at the passing of #DorothyHeight, a champion for women and African Americans for nearly eight decades. Through it all, she fought to unite the oppressed in the struggle for equality. We thank her for a lifetime of service and pledge to build upon her legacy.
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including my ongoing work to protect #Dreamers, an inquiry into possible conflicts of interest at @EPA, sharing info on upcoming local events I'm hosting, and celebrating #InternationalWomensDay. https://t.co/eonXv4MSKV
The effort to #ProtectDreamers continues. I’ve just updated Coloradans who are engaged in this fight about my ongoing work to pass the #DreamAct. Among other things, this bill would provide a pathway to citizenship. Advocacy in DC and communities across the country is helping. https://t.co/U333CN2ABQ
Today the #Paralympics began in #PyeongChang, and Colorado is well represented with 14 athletes on #TeamUSA -- more than any other state. I'm sending best wishes to all these men and women, whose perseverance and skill help them triumph over adversity. You are all winners! https://t.co/NNVn6FIkiY
On Monday, March 12 at 4 p.m. MT, I’ll hold a live telephone town hall to answer your questions about my work in Congress. Register in advance to receive a call when the event begins, or watch it live. I'm looking forward to this important discussion. https://t.co/bqsT2KrQJE https://t.co/uRajLwv1fS
At an Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing, I questioned experts about persistent obstacles to fighting flu outbreaks. They spoke of the need to update vaccine-development methods, which Congress must work to support. @EnergyCommerce @SGottliebFDA @CDCDirector https://t.co/IGPpiSKNN1
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! The theme of this year's commemoration is #PressForProgress, highlighting the ongoing efforts to achieve gender parity worldwide by ensuring access to education, health care, #reprorights, equal pay and more. Equality is in everyone's interest. https://t.co/tAFKIpwtwB
Wonderful news! The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the rights of #trans individuals to be protected under the Civil Rights Act. Now Congress should pass the #EqualityAct to ensure #LGBTQ people are covered under this landmark law nationwide. https://t.co/tA3WysVYN8
It's clear the #GOP doesn't want to talk about #gunviolence, but Americans are demanding that Congress address this epidemic. I joined @EnergyCommerce Dems in sending a letter to Chairman @repgregwalden requesting hearings to tackle the issue. https://t.co/4ZhMFFvbND
Fellow Democrats on @EnergyCommerce and I have written to Chairman @repgregwalden: Hold hearings on #gunviolence now. It’s the committee’s duty to address critical issues within its jurisdiction, and we must tackle this nationwide public health crisis. https://t.co/4ZhMFFvbND
The Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly supported, was reauthorized five years ago today. Congress needs to renew this historic law again before it expires this fall, and this country must continue working to end domestic violence. #VAWA
Current and former firemen are visiting DC on behalf of the Colorado Professional Fire Fighters. I'm working hard to pass legislation that helps these everyday heroes, including #HR931, a bipartisan bill that establishes the first national cancer registry for firefighters. https://t.co/BbrdRgkMl4
FACT: Democrats have offered 23 motions to bring the #DREAMAct up for a vote in the House. @HouseGOP has blocked every single one. Running? Hardly. We are standing firm to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/3huBz3ZSGa
Pleased to deliver opening remarks at @ACLAlabs' annual meeting, where I spoke about my ongoing efforts in Congress to advance patients' access to life-saving diagnostics, including working to pass the bipartisan Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act w/@RepLarryBucshon. #ACLA18 https://t.co/F8T2OTmxiw
The #congressionalartcompetition is underway, and all eligible high school students in our community with a passion for visual arts are encouraged to apply.

Senior @EPA appointees, including one from Colorado, are moonlighting as political consultants, raising serious concerns that their outside work could compromise the agency’s mission. I’m demanding answers together with fellow @EnergyCommerce leaders. https://t.co/GfIiCB5w0b
Congrats to native Coloradan (and family friend) Bryan Fogel, whose @IcarusNetflix earned the #Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Thank you for highlighting the serious problem of #doping in athletics; you’ve inspired my ongoing work in Congress on this issue. Kudos to you!
Today the @Selma50Jubilee includes a reenactment of the bridge crossing from #Selma to Montgomery. I followed that path 20 years ago with the formidable @RepJohnLewis and our congressional colleagues. The struggle for justice continues as we commemorate this historic moment. https://t.co/JEBgCzMw2b
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including working in Washington and Colorado to end #gunviolence, fighting to restore #NetNeutrality, taking action on #opioid abuse, protecting our #Dreamers and celebrating #WomensHistoryMonth. https://t.co/wr7Xgm7lvE
Students at @denversouthhigh are committed to ending #gunviolence for good! I'm here to discuss my work in Congress to pass #gunsafety legislation, which has been strengthened by the passionate advocacy of young people working to achieve real and lasting change. @DPSNewsNow https://t.co/i0CN2JSopg
Starting the day off right with a visit to Denver's La Casita for a Cafecito Coffee, a collaborative gathering of Latina businesswomen. I was pleased to speak with this influential group about my work promoting economic empowerment &amp; entrepreneurship, protecting #Dreamers &amp; more. https://t.co/cELba0qShK
Looking forward to visiting @denversouthhigh, my alma mater, for a discussion today with students about my work on #gunsafety, their concerns, and how they can help end mass shootings. Their efforts in the wake of the tragedy in #Parkland have been impressive. @DPSNewsNow
One year ago today, @SecretaryZinke was confirmed to head @Interior, and in that time has launched an assault on our public lands, shrinking our national monuments and working to open them for mining and drilling. #WhatWouldTeddySay? Probably a few choice words. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/D4Srz0cF30
This #WomensHistoryMonth , we honor every woman who has worked to improve our world and advance gender equality. Many of their battles are not yet won, and it's up to us to continue the fight. We can all play a historic role in advancing women’s rights when we are united. https://t.co/7OqlVP1Ewf
A reminder that under the leadership of @EPAScottPruitt, scientific #censorship continues. This is what the #ClimateChange page on @EPA's website looks like now. #DefendClimate https://t.co/h6OCETAckF https://t.co/uOmowqezAi
I've never been afraid of the @NRA. It’s heartening now to see more and more colleagues stand up to them. A record 200 of us are cosponsoring the bipartisan #ThompsonKing Background Checks Bill that strengthens the system and helps keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.
Republicans promised their #GOPTaxScam would make filing easier, but it's causing confusion for employers and employees alike. @IRSnews has announced an online calculator to check withholdings; use it to ensure you're not overpaying or underpaying #taxes. https://t.co/DRqJO8XUrM
Yet another reason why @SecretaryAzar should #FireScottLloyd. https://t.co/xvJsvRhoEP
Trump appointee Scott Lloyd denies undocumented immigrants have rights to care that @SCOTUS has affirmed. He reportedly gets a spreadsheet each week w/info on pregnant teens in custody, including whether they’ve asked for abortions. Outrageous overreach.  https://t.co/SK4v0Qohkv
Drug take-back programs, including those organized by @corxconsortium, can help communities tackle #opioid abuse, but only 3% of @DEAHQ-registered facilities conduct them. At today's Health Subcommittee hearing, I asked an official of the agency why these challenges persist. https://t.co/rR89pyOZZc
With @ScottBlackmun leaving, I'll ensure his USOC successor presses on with reforms to prevent further sexual abuse and mistreatment, and provides answers to the questions on these matters that @housecommerce colleagues and I have raised. https://t.co/xz3MGp82EC
Reydesel, a Colorado #Dreamer, settled in the U.S. when he was 10 and grew up in a mixed-status family. He graduated from East High School, but had to put college on hold until #DACA gave him a path forward. He is now an award-winning student at @CUDenver. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/iDQpaTmDGe
Today we introduced legislation in the House and Senate to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality protections. Coloradans have made it clear they want Congress to preserve these safeguards that help small businesses and consumers alike. We must work to #SaveTheInternet. https://t.co/6ix0ROy2L7
I’m demanding @SecAzar fire Scott Lloyd for trying to keep vulnerable teens from accessing abortions. Today I joined @AdvocatesTweets in signing his pink slip &amp; supporting their #1in3 campaign, all part of our ongoing efforts to protect #reprorights and seek #JusticeForJane. https://t.co/ruSKohKPtG
.@FCC is moving forward with a plan to gut #NetNeutrality; it's critical that we push back now. I'm supporting legislation that will protect #NetNeutrality and #SaveTheInternet for Coloradans and every American. https://t.co/owGgJai2K9
Proud to be an original author of the Keep Americans Safe Act (H.R. 4052), a bill making it illegal to purchase or acquire magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. I've long advocated for these types of #gunsafety measures because they make sense and can save lives. https://t.co/eugQ9ImuTF
Maria, a Colorado #Dreamer, was born in Mexico City and immigrated with her family to Lakewood, Colorado at age three. She graduated from Jefferson High School and is now a receptionist for an immigration law firm. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/Fpn2dD545Z
Congrats to all the Olympians from Colorado who competed in #PyeongChang2018. You’ve done your country proud. We look forward to welcoming you home to celebrate in the Centennial State!
Though we don't yet know the details of Secretary Mattis' recommendation, one can only hope it is a clear rebuke of @POTUS' discriminatory #transban, signaling  a continued march toward #LGBTQ equality.  If not, we’ll just keep marching. https://t.co/NGPYWYqJIH
Wonderful news! @POTUS' effort to scrap this smart Obama-era rule was simply a favor to big business and not based in real evidence. I'm pleased that Judge William Orrick recognized this and ruled accordingly. Our public lands will be healthier for now, but our fight continues. https://t.co/wENYuQrqCD
.@FCC is forging ahead with its reckless #NetNeutrality repeal, placing the order today in the Federal Register, giving us only 60 days to reverse the plan before it largely goes into effect. The clock is ticking. Congress must act now to prevent this. https://t.co/SBw9ZeDLt5 https://t.co/W5lT14PUML
Bernabe, a #Colorado Dreamer, immigrated with his family from Mexico more than a decade ago. He is a lead immigration paralegal for a local law firm and is enrolled at @msudenver with plans to attend law school. He is also active in local #LGBTQ groups. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/3l4WdlC4bq
Moments of silence, thoughts and prayers aren’t enough to commemorate the 17 slain in the #ParklandShooting or any senseless massacre. Congress must do right by them and pass #gunsafety legislation so no community knows this anguish again. #ParklandTownHall #StudentsDemandAction https://t.co/rrxOkkUPey
#HBD to my good friend and Conscience of the Congress, @repjohnlewis! Whether marching from Selma to Montgomery, leading @HouseDemocrats in a historic sit-in and more for #gunsafety, or inspiring other kinds of “good trouble,” you remain a bedrock of moral leadership. https://t.co/inngEfm8O4
A day after @POTUS proposed slashing @EPA budget 23%, @EPAScottPruitt took a 1st Class flight for work. He’s taken many more, explaining it’s for safety and to avoid clashes w/folks flying coach. I’m looking into it all with @EnergyCommerce colleagues. https://t.co/OQrE5jIEHD
Marissa, a Colorado #Dreamer, grew up in Glenwood Springs and graduated from @FLCDurango. She taught Spanish at DSST: Green Valley Ranch through @TeachForAmerica. In 2015, she was one of 9 #DACA-enrolled educators honored by @BarackObama as "Champions of Change." #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/HGExs8h22l
.@HHSGov’s proposed rule expanding the sale of short-term junk plans that don't comply with the #ACA's protections is the latest Trump administration effort to sabotage the law. We must stay vigilant in the fight to preserve fair and affordable care for millions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/FRriicCuHW
Amen, George. https://t.co/SWj86P9v0J
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including taking action after the #Parkland shooting, helping to ensure #JusticeForJane, opposing @POTUS' bad budget, reacting to today’s #Russia news and sharing the stories of local #Dreamers. https://t.co/vQmSdzywOL
That said, some will surely try to mask today’s development with the same techniques used in 2016: troll farms, “news” reports from unreliable and foreign-financed outlets, and stoking partisanship in order to undermine our unity as a nation. We must push back against all that
A reminder that this investigation should be of the utmost importance to all Americans, regardless of political party. Ensuring integrity of elections, preventing foreign interference and combating damaging trends in our civil discourse all are parts of preserving our democracy.
2 of the 13 Russians charged w/a plot to interfere in 2016 elections had spent time in Colorado, then sent intelligence about the trip. We’ll see what else Robert Mueller &amp; his team turn up. Four people already had been charged, including @POTUS former national security adviser.
Marco, a Colorado #Dreamer, settled with his family in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood at age three. He graduated from @CUBoulder as student body president with a degree in finance. He is now the program coordinator at @UofDenver's Latino Leadership Institute. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/hwce6Y0X9P
At an @EnergyCommerce hearing, I questioned @SecAzar about reports that Scott Lloyd, director of @HHSGov's Office of Refugee Resettlement, conspired to keep four undocumented teens from obtaining abortions. I've since called for Lloyd's termination for these actions and more. https://t.co/bYp5eFwdvB
If the "meals" delivered to storm-ravaged #PuertoRico and #USVI are any indication, one can surmise that @POTUS' "Blue Apron-style" program for SNAP recipients will be thin gruel. With no plans to include fresh produce or meat, this thoughtless plan should be DOA. https://t.co/yGM1u00sZE
This tone-deaf monstrosity is an insult to everyone affected by #gunviolence, including #Parkland. If the @NRA really loved people, it would work to protect them through bipartisan, common-sense #gunsafety reforms. Instead, for the sake of power &amp; profit, it works to squash them. https://t.co/MFRI5kH1BV
I will vote against #HR620, a cruel attack on the disabled that undermines the bipartisan #AmericansWithDisabilitiesAct. A civil rights attorney before coming to Congress, I remain focused on empowering vulnerable Americans and protecting their basic liberties. #SaveADA https://t.co/HNYoJFUjlt
My heart breaks for the victims of the #Parkland shooting, the latest in a long line of senseless massacres. Congress has the power to help prevent these tragedies. Inaction is simply not an option, and we must work now to save lives.
Reports of @EPAScottPruitt’s latest lavish spending are disturbing. Now he claims a blanket waiver to fly 1st Class on a whim. We're investigating his purchases, and are expanding our inquiry to include this recent news as well as his other travel habits. https://t.co/IfEO2BD0Dp
Today I'm sending a message of support and solidarity #ToImmigrantsWithLove. We’ve opposed @POTUS' #MuslimBan on the Supreme Court steps, protested hate speech and fought to #ProtectDreamers, and we’ll keep working hard to preserve everyone’s right to achieve the American Dream. https://t.co/fZGnRmv0SP
Maria, a Colorado #Dreamer, came to the U.S. at the age of five &amp; attends @CUDenver with plans to enroll in med school. She also serves as coordinator of @msudenver's Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life, which received the multicultural event of the year award in 2016. #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/mkZ2EfHY6r
I’m sharing the stories of Colorado #Dreamers whose lives will be upended if Congress doesn't pass a legislative solution soon to protect them from deportation. They've worked hard to fulfill big dreams in the only country most have ever known. We must #ProtectDreamers.
Millions sounded off on @FCC's controversial move to repeal #NetNeutrality, but were they heard over the din of fake Russian filings? @EnergyCommerce and I sent a letter to @AjitPaiFCC seeking answers on how the agency handled the public comment period. https://t.co/ErFIhHvsWR https://t.co/gAtnVVP3TJ
It's shameful that @BLMNational will replace this common-sense rule. They've ignored the courts and the warnings that I and 80 Dem colleagues shared in a letter urging @SecretaryZinke to implement it. Are profits more important than our public lands? https://t.co/4ncM1x8sok
A banner day in #PyeongChang2018  as the medals keep coming for #TeamUSA. Congrats to @chloekimsnow and Coloradan @arielletgold for your thrilling wins! https://t.co/AImzkCnOA4
Another troubling development in @POTUS' ongoing war on #LGBTQ progress. @BetsyDeVosED may choose to ignore the concerns of #trans students, but those of us with a commitment to equality will continue working to uplift their voices. https://t.co/ZwNUNXXGg9
This is extremely troubling. If accurate, the information from these whistleblowers shows that the Trump administration is taking direct orders from extreme, anti-choice fringe groups.  I'll continue looking into these very concerning reports. https://t.co/eFihZafl0T
The #TrumpBudget will stall progress on critical local and national priorities. It's also fiscally irresponsible, setting the stage for disastrous long-term effects, and breaks even more promises to the American people. https://t.co/vTHaRWTebK https://t.co/becwnOs9ov
Congratulations to this outstanding young Coloradan! You’ve made the Centennial State and our entire  country very proud. #PyeongChang2018 https://t.co/p22R9HcsSi
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including opposing the #GOP's fifth inadequate spending bill, protecting and honoring #Dreamers, fighting the opioid epidemic, preventing sexual harassment, and cheering on #TeamUSA. https://t.co/GVEZJ3PAH5
Kudos to @DenverHealthMed for honoring the legacy of Coloradan Bernard F. Gipson and his commitment to ensuring access to quality health care for all. Such contributions are rightly recognized not just during #BHM, but year-round. https://t.co/DLi4BBFP1G
I voted against the #GOP's fifth stopgap spending bill, passed early this morning while most Americans were fast asleep. We can no longer fund our government through these inadequate measures that create instability. https://t.co/KQtZh5jFK1
Evidence suggests @POTUS' pick to lead @HHSOCR, March Bell, secretly coordinated w/extremists while working for #GOP’s now-defunct #SelectPanel to Attack Women’s Health. This would make Bell unfit to serve at @HHSGov; we’re asking @SecAzar to look into it. https://t.co/4wPnCjyFxL
Sending best wishes to the 31 Colorado Olympians set to complete in #PyeongChang2018, especially my constituent @lagibbs84.

Video highlights from Tuesday's bipartisan news conference on @HouseCommerce &amp; @EnergyCommerce investigation into #opioid pill dumping, including our strong words for @DEAHQ, which isn't cooperating with our very reasonable requests for vital info. https://t.co/jj2seAgWe1
.@ICEgov's practice of separating immigrant families at the U.S./Mexico border is cruel and unnecessary. I joined my fellow @HouseDemocrats in sending @DHSgov a letter expressing our grave concerns and demanding the agency employ more humane methods. https://t.co/oM3yEF2eJS https://t.co/AERNT8d0tm
Democrats are offering #ABetterDeal on #infrastructure that delivers for Coloradans and all Americans. Our blueprint represents a real federal investment, as opposed to @POTUS' weak plan that’s devoid of substance. https://t.co/UIvA7UIFnn
A willfully feeble @StateDept attempt to review effects of Trump’s expanded #GlobalGagRule. It’s not comprehensive or transparent; consultation with stakeholders was minimal. These policies harm women &amp; families worldwide and should be treated accordingly. https://t.co/fpn11zwyNz
Honored to show solidarity with @NancyPelosi as she shared stories of #Dreamers across the country, including a constituent of mine. I hope @SpeakerRyan was listening to her record-breaking remarks. He can #ProtectDreamers by bringing the #DreamAct up for a vote. #GoNancyGo https://t.co/6tIdLLnKth
Honored to hear @NancyPelosi share the story of a CO. #Dreamer during her record-breaking speech on the House floor to #ProtectDreamers. My constituent Marco Dorado came to Denver at age three and has thrived as a leader at @CUBoulder and in our community. #GoNancyGo #DreamActNow https://t.co/hfYCrrdvg9
We must #ProtectDreamers not only from the threat of deportation, but also from bigoted stereotypes held by powerful people who can do them harm. Mr. Kelly, the White House you attempt to manage could learn a whole lot about work ethic from the #Dreamers you continue to insult. https://t.co/kAXEBnhBjP
My @HouseCommerce colleagues and I are fed up with @DEAHQ's intransigence in our investigation into alleged #opioid pill dumping in WV, which has national implications. The DEA refuses to cooperate; the redacted documents they've just sent us are pitiful. @EnergyCommerce https://t.co/IORRje4XSM
I will vote against @HouseGOP's fifth stopgap spending bill. This temporary measure funds the government through March 23, but it still doesn't address a number of important bipartisan priorities. We can't reward this incompetence. https://t.co/Isiy0j1MhN
House R's and D's have come together to pass legislation overhauling the flawed process by which sexual #harassment victims working in #Congress seek justice. Reform is long overdue; this a step toward giving victims the courage to come forward to say #MeToo. https://t.co/Y8vZLmCWkP
This #BlackHistoryMonth, be sure to follow @NMAAHC, the official Twitter account of the newest @smithsonian museum. They're honoring groundbreaking African Americans who have been essential to the country’s culture and progress. Their stories are America's story.
The GOP-led Congress has failed to renew two popular and successful programs that fund safety net hospitals and health centers, both of which are vital to the lives of the Americans who rely on them. Read more in @Denverpost: https://t.co/SxoocVeNJU
If Congress does not act swiftly to fully fund these two #healthcare programs for low-income patients, local economies will be devastated and access to quality care for Coloradans and people across America will be severely jeopardized. https://t.co/SxoocVeNJU
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including reaction to @POTUS' dismal #SOTU, my work highlighting the importance of the #SDP and #CHCs, which are threatened by #GOP intransigence, and supporting Colorado entrepreneurs. https://t.co/VDQ5vH7ODL
If this report is accurate, it’s beyond the pale for government officials - or anyone - even to consider such a horrific move. I’m looking into it. https://t.co/GLF7KleyL8
This morning I spoke with @AprilZesbaugh and @LenzContact about last night’s #SOTU address. The White House had promised it would unite the country, but @POTUS delivered a divisive speech. Americans deserve far better. @KOANewsRadio https://t.co/iGWwgppoKT
America's reputation as a beacon to the world has been tarnished due to @POTUS' trampling of democratic ideals, abandoning global commitments such as the Paris Climate Accord, and insulting other countries in vulgar terms. This only weakens our standing abroad. #SOTU https://t.co/Ys323KVlAO
.@POTUS has undermined the very bonds that he says he sought to restore. Time and again, he has attacked bastions of our democracy and guardians of our security, including media freedom, an independent judiciary and our intelligence agencies. #BrokenPromises #SOTU https://t.co/Vb0FwvLjep
The #GOPTaxScam is a massive giveaway to corporations and the ultra-wealthy at the expense of the middle class. I support bipartisan tax reform that provides real relief to Americans, but this law just represents more #brokenpromises from @POTUS and congressional Republicans. https://t.co/5A7WDLHTlb
We can anticipate what he’ll say, but the broken promises and reversals of progress of the past year also indicate #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout at tonight's #SOTU. What do you think he SHOULD address? Americans are desperate for bipartisan solutions. RT and reply with your thoughts. https://t.co/AYUbRAJhxS
Shame on @SenateGOP for taking up an extreme bill banning abortion after 20 weeks. This legislation, which endangers countless women, passed the House last year, and it's up for a vote in the Senate today. We can't let this attack on #reprorights become law. #StopTheBans https://t.co/ABDrY6Uftw
Colorado community health centers are emblematic of #CHCs nationwide: They face an uncertain future due to poor budget practices of the GOP-led U.S. Congress. This endangers people who rely on such vital #healthcare safety nets &amp; harms all our communities. https://t.co/qtFYLMvAtp

Reports that @POTUS tried to fire Special Counsel #Mueller shortly after he was tapped to lead the #Russia investigation are extremely disturbing. All who value our Democratic institutions must work to ensure he doesn't undermine them. My statement: https://t.co/pdZUz9mxD1 https://t.co/oWWPiV0dCm
Among the many vital priorities Congress must fully fund is the Special #Diabetes Program. This bipartisan initiative has spurred innovation and relief for millions, but it's now in jeopardy ever since funding lapsed in October. We MUST protect the #SDP by reauthorizing it. https://t.co/VvmMRjOvFk
On this day in 1972, trailblazer #ShirleyChisholm announced her bid for the presidency. Her words and her fighting spirit are more important than ever, which is why I have cosponsored a bill to honor her with a statue in the U.S. Capitol. #ChisholminUSCapitol https://t.co/FLqMlYfzEl
At @DenverHealthMed, I joined staff in highlighting the urgent need to fully fund critical public health priories, including the Special #Diabetes Program and #CHC's. Hospitals across America need Congress to address them to ensure good health for our communities. https://t.co/uW4nkZSoKE
I joined a bipartisan group of House and Senate colleagues in sending a letter to @POTUS demanding that he urge AG Jeff Sessions to respect #marijuana laws in Colorado &amp; other states. Candidate Trump said he’d do this, and we're holding him accountable. https://t.co/qR3ftHCVug https://t.co/Nz40e29hoN
Denver believes it is in compliance with federal law. City officials have been communicating with the Justice Department. The DOJ's most recent threat is a scare tactic that is unproductive at best. https://t.co/29XDbgwnuK
Looking forward to my visit today to @DenverHealthMed, where we'll discuss the missing health care elements in the latest spending bill, including long-term funding for #CHC's and the Special Diabetes Program. Coloradans deserve better.
One year after @POTUS reinstated the #GlobalGagRule, a stark reminder that this administration's anti-choice efforts affect women &amp; families around the world. Even worse, they jeopardize progress on vital public health priorities such as ending HIV/AIDS. https://t.co/CANJlU8dPJ
I'm going to vote NO on the fourth consecutive stopgap spending bill. The #GOP has got to stop limping along with these irresponsible short-term funding bills, and this one also neglects #opioid funding, CHCs, #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI and #DACA. https://t.co/aQPssVmdGG
On #Roe45, a clear majority of Americans remain committed to protecting abortion rights from anti-choice attacks. As co-chair of the @ProChoiceCaucus, I'm prepared to lead the resistance. Read more on the historic case here: https://t.co/nXuRCLCheH https://t.co/7NiiqBVr07

Republicans' habit of funding the government with three- and four-week spending bills is political malfeasance. These stopgap measures don't secure our nation or support long-term bipartisan priorities. #GOP leaders must negotiate in good faith with Democrats on a real budget. https://t.co/6vsKPgx1nL
The government should be open and working. The GOP owns the #TrumpShutdown, but they can end it by working with Dems to fund important priorities such as #CHIP, fighting #opioid abuse, biomedical research, CHCs, protection for #Dreamers, and more. #DoYourJob! https://t.co/1V4smAY3Ed
The #TrumpShutdown represents the total failure of GOP-controlled government. #DoYourJob https://t.co/0yzLKaco7E
.@POTUS is getting his wish for "a good shutdown," but it should now be clear to him that there's nothing good about it. I'm in DC fighting for a bipartisan agreement that protects the many priorities he has neglected. Let's end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/mqJF1M68D4 https://t.co/qqG3R3TBVh
I am prepared to stay in Washington for as long as it takes to negotiate a spending bill that addresses these urgent priorities and ends the #GOPshutdown.
Responsibility for this #shutdown belongs to Republicans who control both houses of Congress and the White House. For months, they neglected priorities such as #CHIP, CHCs, #opioids &amp; #DACA and rejected good-faith efforts by Democrats to negotiate bipartisan solutions.
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest from DC, including my views on the impending gov't. #shutdown, as well as my efforts to protect #reprorights, censure @POTUS for racist remarks, improve the prescription drug approval process, and more. https://t.co/t5xS4misDi

In 2002, Congress reaffirmed with strong bipartisan support that infanticide is illegal and infants are entitled to appropriate medical care. Today’s vote was merely a spurious, partisan ploy timed to please March for Life participants. https://t.co/IPpVvEJli5
I'll vote against the #GOP's fourth consecutive stopgap spending bill because it is political malpractice. It offers no relief for the #opioid epidemic, community health centers, SDP, #PuertoRico and #USVI, #Dreamers, and more. Let's end these games. https://t.co/1VUC8yVsaV
Many Coloradans are still feeling the impact from the 2015 Gold King Mine disaster that released toxins into nearby rivers. At a hearing of the Subcommittee on the Environment, I pressed an @EPA official for a commitment to permanently clean up the site. https://t.co/dmw69gGHfN

.@HouseGOP's #HR4712 is a solution in search of a problem that only serves to bully abortion providers, imposing draconian criminal penalties on them.

.@POTUS racist remarks against immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African nations don't represent America's inclusive spirit. That's why I have joined my colleagues in formally censuring him for these comments. We are and will remain a diverse nation of immigrants. https://t.co/qsVrdZ2zGX
Just two days after #MLKDay, @HouseGOP will bring to a vote #HR2954, which makes it easier for banks to get away with discriminatory mortgage-lending practices like redlining. I'll vote NO.
Support for our effort to #SaveNetNeutrality is growing! We must reverse the FCC rollback of #NetNeutrality protections for innovation and fair access to the internet for all. https://t.co/CCrSbXr57N
The Trump Administration is in such a rush to push #Dreamers out of the country that the Justice Department hopes to skip the 9th Circuit review of last week’s injunction and go straight to #SCOTUS.  https://t.co/DSlwiJrrFc
2017 saw devastating #GOP attacks on #reprorights in Congress and from the White House, which were met by strong resistance. @PPFA expects more battles in 2018 on many fronts, but we'll be ready. Read their fascinating report on Women's Health Policy: https://t.co/vMJ4fW1Wyn
I joined a diverse group of Coloradans to once again participate in Denver's annual #Marade.

At @TGPdenver discussing how the #GOPTaxScam will harm our community, including nonprofits such as this one. I'm all for making the tax code simpler, but giving big tax breaks to corporations and the ultra-wealthy at the expense of the vulnerable is unacceptable. https://t.co/8R6gXsu5rg

Wonderful news! My bill, the EPS Improvement Act (H.R. 518), was signed into law today. It will promote energy conservation and encourage innovations in LED lighting, providing much-needed updates for industry and consumers alike. Bipartisan achievements are still possible.
Another extremely disturbing @POTUS comment on immigration that further proves his "America First" views are rooted in bigotry and xenophobia. Repeated rhetoric of this sort by the occupant of the White House is a disgrace to our nation. https://t.co/SDinDcfsZp

On @cspanwj, I spoke with a Republican from Tennessee who agrees on the need to #ProtectDreamers and, like me, feels immigration and border controls require a mix of measures. Congress can and should devise solutions based on such common ground. https://t.co/F9qxb5tK2E
The #GOP's funding of our government in three-week-long increments is political malpractice. No one wants a government shutdown, especially #Dreamers, families on #CHIP and others, but Republican recalcitrance continues to take us to the budgetary brink. @cspanwj https://t.co/CV4PCuwl0I
Good morning! Looking forward to being on @cspanwj at 6:30 MT (8:30 ET) to talk #DACA, #marijuana policy, funding for #CHIP and political brinksmanship over the budget. We’re taking viewer questions - join the conversation.
The court's #DACA decision is welcome, but not permanent relief for #Dreamers in Colorado and across America. @POTUS will appeal, and in any case the program is still set to end. Congress MUST #ProtectDreamers by passing a legislative solution to this ongoing crisis. https://t.co/4I1dXnYQ17
#Democracy “is our national religion, and it prompts in us the desire for that measure of justice which is based on equal opportunity, equal protection, equal freedom for all." #OTD 1918. https://t.co/vlwYCVa079

As Republicans heap praise on themselves for passing #GOPTaxScam, word is getting around that they’ll leave #CHIP out of the year-end spending bill. Unconscionable. Many working families will spend the holiday season wondering whether their kids will have health care next year.
I led 87 colleagues in writing to @HHSGov and @CDCgov demanding clarity on reports that CDC leaders are stopping employees from using words such as "fetus," "evidence-based" and "transgender" in documents. Ideology should not trump science in public health. https://t.co/OUueyNPwXT

BREAKING: @HouseGOP passes the #GOPTaxScam with zero Democratic support. The Senate votes next on massive giveaway to corporations and the ultra-rich at the expense of the middle class. We must continue raising our voices in opposition.

Coloradans have made it clear that they want to preserve #NetNeutrality, a cause I’ve long supported. I plan to co-sponsor a resolution by @USRepMikeDoyle to restore the protections that were reversed by @FCC. The future of the open internet is at stake. https://t.co/7o6WTd9q0H
Good to see movement on these matters. I raised questions about @EPA preparedness for disasters in #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI versus U.S. states at a recent hearing and while visiting these hurricane-damaged U.S. territories two weeks ago. https://t.co/4igkORi9R5
It has been five years since the horrific shooting at #SandyHook that killed 26. Today, we honor these victims of senseless gun violence and the thousands more Americans who have been murdered since then. This epidemic won't end without #gunsafety legislation. https://t.co/DH3YdDzMP3
.@FCC just voted to gut #NetNeutrality, but this isn't an end. I will continue working to ensure a free and open internet for all. Thank you to the many Coloradans who expressed to me the importance of these protections. Together we'll push back on this decision. https://t.co/wmJWcQry4W
.@AjitPaiFCC plans @FCC vote today to gut #NetNeutrality, but I'm pushing back. I joined 117 congressional colleagues in a letter urging him to cancel this vote. The future of the free and open internet is at stake. https://t.co/hGtu90P3jY
I joined 117 colleagues in sending a letter to @AjitPaiFCC urging him to cancel the agency's upcoming vote to dismantle #NetNeutrality. Americans have spoken loud and clear: They want to protect everyone's right to a free and open internet. I'm with them. https://t.co/hGtu90P3jY https://t.co/gRy9YRkD2C

Check out this video commemorating #CURESatOne. My co-author, @RepFredUpton, and I reflect on the law’s historic passage and remarkable progress in its first year. @EnergyCommerce @HouseCommerce https://t.co/ObqHgdO7ij
As of today, 12,034 #DACA recipients have lost their status since @POTUS ended the program on Sept 5. #Dreamers can’t wait any longer. Every day of inaction leads to 122 more Dreamers losing status. Congress must #protectDreamers &amp; pass the #DreamActNow. https://t.co/epudmr4y9y https://t.co/y8lCAe4bol
#ThankYouAlabama. On top of everything else, this victory means the Senate will have to work in a more balanced way. Good lawmaking takes principled compromise; Senate majority leadership now will need to rely on that. Looking forward to working with you, @GDouglasJones!
On #21stCenturyCures' first birthday, I'm celebrating a year of research, advocacy and renewed hope for millions. @RepFredUpton @EnergyCommerce @HouseCommerce https://t.co/fXFWLxHbD3
We can't ignore multiple #sexualharassment allegations against one of the most powerful men in the world. All must be held accountable, which is why we must listen to @POTUS' accusers and launch a congressional investigation. https://t.co/rmAzQhA28A
.@EPA IG’s decision to look into this dubious purchase by @EPAScottPruitt is a necessary first step. I questioned him on it last week, months after requesting an investigation into the matter. We must determine if he is being a responsible steward of the agency’s funds. https://t.co/6AkSEdU4WO
Two years after the landmark #ParisAgreement was finalized, every country on the planet but the United States has indicated their support for it. @POTUS’ announced withdrawal endangers humanity and damages our nation’s status abroad. We must be a leader on climate. #StillIn. https://t.co/gdwDWOIsT8
The 17 women who have accused @realDonaldTrump of sexual misconduct must be heard. I’ve joined @HouseDemWomen calling for a full congressional investigation of these allegations. https://t.co/ATMtX2JZ6u

#Transgender individuals will now have the opportunity to serve our country in the new year. The fight likely isn't over, though.  We must continue speaking out against @POTUS' shameful attempts to discriminate against #LGBTQ Americans. https://t.co/EeFgLVo2Kp

In this week's e-newsletter, I'm recapping the latest from DC, including my work protecting #CHIP and #Dreamers, advocating for #PuertoRico and #USVI, opposing #HR38, holding @EPA Administrator Pruitt accountable, and more. https://t.co/DLaQvcqrCK
I led nearly 100 of my colleagues in sending a letter to House and Senate leadership demanding they responsibly extend funding for #CHIP ASAP, which will run out of money in Colorado by the end of January.  As one of its creators, this is personal.  https://t.co/RzyTJURrdW https://t.co/e5kYUzQUBe
#Gunviolence forever changed these Coloradans’ lives. Jane and Tim Dougherty lost Jane’s sister in the #SandyHook shooting, and Tom Mauser’s son was killed in Columbine. They are in Washington to advocate for #gunsafety. Like me, they oppose #HR38. #StopCCR https://t.co/ZLZSl3qGTQ
Questions about #OpenEnrollment? @C4HCO has you covered with lots of info online about how to save on quality health insurance under the #ACA. You can also stop by my Denver office to pick up one of these handy pamphlets.  Why wait? #GetCovered today. https://t.co/ktThewsPqd https://t.co/S3P2zW4iCh
Coloradans shouldn’t have to adopt others states' reckless gun violence prevention standards, but that's exactly what #HR38 will do. If this bill becomes law, Coloradans would be in greater peril. I refuse to let that happen without a fight. https://t.co/Smk6Dzqq4X https://t.co/Fwtc5MksRf
Thanks to representatives from @UNEcolorado for stopping by my Washington, DC office today. They're doing important work to #ProtectDreamers in our community. I share this goal, which is why I'm demanding that Congress pass a #DACA fix by year's end. #DreamActNow https://t.co/JHGsh5KyER
Last weekend, I took an eye-opening trip to #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI to survey the hurricane recovery effort together with other members of @HouseCommerce.  In @thehill, @RepFredUpton and I lay out some next steps to help our fellow Americans. @EnergyCommerce https://t.co/6opB8zxF6L

#Russia’s doping manipulation scheme at the #Sochi games undermined the spirit of the @Olympics and fair, competitive sport. I've highlighted this controversy through @HouseCommerce hearings and welcome the decision to restore fair competition to the #WinterOlympics. https://t.co/8w7Qbzvl7a
Wonderful to meet with students from @nyuniversity, where I attended law school, for a wide-ranging discussion that included the #GOPTaxScam, college affordability and my experiences raising a family as a member of the Colorado legislature and the U.S. Congress. https://t.co/cmDppx3u00
It’s outrageous that @HouseGOP responds to two of the worst mass shootings in modern American history by weakening our gun laws through #HR38. Change can only happen when elected officials stand up to the gun lobby and reject dangerous proposals such as this. #OpposeCCR
#SCOTUS hears #MasterpieceCakeshop oral arguments this a.m. At a rally supporting the respondents just now, I talked about the progress Colorado has made in #LGBTQ rights, from passing the anti-gay Amendment 2 the year I was elected to the State House to embracing equality today. https://t.co/nNlq3uokQo
A disappointing ruling, but not an end to our fight to stop @POTUS' discriminatory #MuslimBan. As the lower courts review the edict, we must continue speaking truth to power and keep alive our country's spirit of inclusivity. https://t.co/lUbBDBb6v8
BREAKING: @POTUS continues to raid public lands for private gain, this time declaring national monuments in Utah open for exploitation by developers. He has already come after our national parks. Now it’s #BearsEars and #GrandStaircaseEscalante. Where will it end? https://t.co/jwPr7HhOYL
On my visit to St. Croix in #USVI together with other @HouseCommerce committee members: a post office still reduced nearly to rubble two months after #Maria made landfall. Basic services that we in the continental U.S. take for granted remain hampered here. https://t.co/62Cfr8QGoX
An aerial view of damage to houses on my trip to #PuertoRico together with other @HouseCommerce members. Only 24% of homes that need these blue tarps to keep the weather out currently have them. Unacceptable. https://t.co/ijxvlDu4Ty
Energy infrastructure still in shambles after #Maria. In the first pic, destroyed solar panels in St. Croix. In the second, a major power plant in San Juan whose stacks are still down. https://t.co/91jTpB7R2U
Couldn’t agree more, @SenatorTester, and this thing is headed our way today. The House will vote on a procedure to reconcile the rushed #GOPTaxScam, margin scribbles and all, with the equally egregious @HouseGOP bill. What a disgrace. https://t.co/q4TFWKEr3v
Infrastructure recovery still has a long way to go in #PuertoRico. Housing, sanitation, power, roads — all affect health and mortality for our fellow Americans here. @POTUS, we won’t forget about them even as you move on to other subjects. @EnergyCommerce https://t.co/WCEGF7KcEa
The @HouseCommerce health subcommittee has been focusing on this issue, and the answers we got from officials in DC were unsettling. Our observations while in #PuertoRico will help us address these inconsistencies. @EnergyCommerce https://t.co/PKP1pnhe81
After holding hearings involving #PuertoRico recovery and rebuilding efforts, I’m seeing them up close this weekend with @HouseCommerce colleagues. Much more work to be done shoulder to shoulder with our fellow Americans here. @EnergyCommerce https://t.co/lYq60WaQaL

On #WorldAIDSDay, we remember the terrible toll of this disease through the decades and celebrate medical advances that have saved millions of others.

Hooray - we just passed HR 3017 supporting @EPA's brownfields cleanup program. While serving in Colo. legislature, I wrote the state brownfield program law, boosting Denver’s economic rebound and green space expansion. Here in Congress, I worked on the original 2002 federal law.
If you haven't figured out that the #GOPTaxScam is a raw deal for working families by now, just look at the important deductions that are on the chopping block. Tax season will be tougher on average Americans while the ultra-wealthy can line more of their pockets. https://t.co/NehWEbqydP
Wonderful to be reunited with Max Schill, the boy who helped make #21stCenturyCures a reality. I’m so glad he is back in Washington DC as we reflect on the law’s incredible success a year after it passed the House and to advocate for those with #rarediseases. https://t.co/Ju198Tnclg
Nearly a year after its passage, #21stCenturyCures has already facilitated breakthroughs in critical research, and the best is yet to come. At a @HouseCommerce hearing, I'm reflecting on its initial successes and future potential to save millions of lives. https://t.co/5zGK6Ef4k9
Who are some of the people the #GOPTaxScam hits the hardest? Teachers … and seniors … and veterans … and students … and people with disabilities and chronic illnesses.  Everyday Americans will be seriously hurt if this terrible bill becomes law.
On @MSNBC, I spoke with @AriMelber on the critical need to renew #CHIP, which could soon be taken away from 100k Colorado kids. https://t.co/40pHw0YjOr
In just a few minutes, I'll be speaking with @AriMelber on @MSNBC about protecting #CHIP. Republicans' failure to renew this insurance program is forcing many Colorado families to face the difficult prospect of losing their kids' coverage.
Every day, more #DREAMers are losing DACA protections and put at risk of deportation. We must #ProtectDREAMers and pass the #DREAMAct before the end of the year. https://t.co/2ssJHekYbN

#GOPTaxScam has passed the House, but I am proud to have voted against this gift to corporations and the ultra-wealthy. This bill should never become law. Instead, Congress should come together to make our tax code more efficient and more equitable.
Look who’s the poster child for today’s debate on the #GOPTaxScam. The ultra-rich and corporations will benefit from this bill, while millions in the middle class will see their taxes rise. @stevenmnuchin1 and @louiselinton know how to strike a pose! https://t.co/TVsIfRllm0
Rigging the tax system to benefit the ultra-rich leaves the middle class behind, and it has for decades. How many times must the #GOP engage in this dangerous experiment before admitting how much it hurts average Americans? Their latest #GOPTaxScam must never become law https://t.co/khuaNikpZb
I wholeheartedly reject @POTUS' recent rules allowing bosses to deny #birthcontrol coverage to their employees. This sexist edict must be overturned, and I'm leading the charge to do it. https://t.co/4KgOj4Jyrz
#BirthControl IS health care, and I led my colleagues in the @ProChoiceCaucus, where I serve as co-chair, in reminding @POTUS and his congressional GOP allies that we won't stand for their efforts to rip it away from millions of women. It's 2017! This right was affirmed long ago. https://t.co/DLG3Xamm9l
Tomorrow's @FCC vote will cut enrollment in Lifeline by 70%, but America has a “homework gap” that affects 30% of our country’s children. We need #LifelineForAll to succeed to ensure all Americans, especially children, receive affordable internet and phone access. https://t.co/AFYXo7Udrt
A cut-and-paste response to tragedy is revolting, especially from the president. Has #gunviolence become so common in this country that @POTUS would think of last night’s attack as just more of the same? https://t.co/C8P65XJ2wg
.@SenateGOP tax bill will gut the #ACA with a provision to reverse the individual mandate. Ripping health care from millions, destabilizing markets, all to benefit corporations and the ultra-wealthy. What a #GOPTaxScam. We must #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/4gnR1Rt6Ti
Did @EPA hurricane response overlook #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI? As Americans continue rebuilding from #Maria, I sought answers from top officials. https://t.co/uul4nYE8ej

If this shameful effort is added to the tax bill, there would be four million fewer people with insurance in 2019, 13 million by 2027. Meanwhile, the debt would go up by $1.7 trillion. Exactly how is the #GOPTaxScam good for America? https://t.co/40qUTa5gsK
Don't be fooled by those who say the #ACA is imploding. Record numbers of people are signing up for quality health coverage during this #OpenEnrollment season – including Coloradans, who have until January 12 to #GetCovered. https://t.co/n4GGEQVxjb

Yes, best to tell the truth, @HouseGOP: Your bill makes adopting a child harder by axing that tax credit even though you’ve pushed your extreme anti-choice, anti-birth control agenda all year. That's hypocritical. And that's that. https://t.co/mtG6o332Tq

I'm pleased this gem will remain protected, but other national monuments are still threatened by @POTUS' exec order. https://t.co/0SK3F3smpV
.@USCBO has long provided fair, unbiased analysis of legislation. @POTUS and the #GOP must respect its integrity. https://t.co/IeibzLVm7C
A close connection between #Medicaid expansion and mental health is shown in a new @USGAO report I requested: https://t.co/9VNh8gpHkx
.@HouseGOP wants to pass spending bills riddled with anti-choice riders. Women of America, what do you say to that? Here's what I say: https://t.co/pN2vjEOvkM
I led my @ProChoiceCaucus colleagues in condemning anti-women #approps riders -- only one piece of the #GOP's dangerous anti-choice agenda. https://t.co/OvuJoaClfv
I'm looking into why insulin &amp; other drug costs are skyrocketing. More details: https://t.co/pm2ELYWpLO #WhatsNextRx https://t.co/8JUuHDEWrQ
JUST IN: @USCBO says #GOP's latest scheme to repeal #ACA would leave 32 million uninsured and make premiums double https://t.co/I13MYoTeLs
.@JoaquinCastrotx: Also interesting that he claims three million voted illegally -- the same amount he lost the popular vote by. #Insecure. https://t.co/7GAbUYUZ3N

As our region suffers unhealthy ozone conditions, @HouseGOP wants to make matters worse with #HR806, which guts the Clean Air Act. No way. https://t.co/rbOu3wzlIV
Americans want bipartisan reform that benefits all. We should seize this moment and do what's best for the health of our nation. (5/5)
These unilateral #GOP efforts aren't the solution. Polls show most people think R's and D's should work together to improve #ACA. (4/5)
Earlier this year, @USCBO showed it would rip coverage away from 32 million people, even higher than #BCRA's 20+ million. (3/5)
But @SenateMajLdr's choice to vote on straight #ACA repeal is even more reckless and potentially devastating. (2/5)
#Trumpcare's failure in the Senate shows that 1) writing a bill in secret is just bad policy and 2) grassroots activism works. (1/5)
#GOP delay of #Trumpcare vote keeps Americans in the dark. Congress must use this opportunity to hold hearings that will get answers. https://t.co/gU0Pe9PMEa
