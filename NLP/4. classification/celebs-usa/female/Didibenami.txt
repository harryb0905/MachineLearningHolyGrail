((((((I’m sending all of you big giant hugs, love &amp; light)))))))
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump Oh my! I hope your wife is ok. I’ll be sending y’all prayers! Good on ya for gettin the girls Mase! NECESSITIES :) All my best to you and yours. Again, thank you for your feedback and I’m glad we cleared that up. It’s always good to hear input, helps me make informed decisions.
@RaulEEsparza omg, who knew u had such a gorgeous voice. Damn! Go Raul!
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump Thank you. Yes, I saw your little profile thumbnail. If those are your girls, they are beautiful... maybe a good idea to get them some mase... just Incase they come out to crazy town, U.S.A. This place is filled with great people but also nasty predators.
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump All in All, there aren’t words to express my gratitude for your support when you watched me sing my big ol’ emotional heart out on @AmericanIdol ;) and getting the record. #Reverie has a few cryptic/poetic references to the abuse and assaults... listen closely to the lyrics...;)
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump Ya, I know which episode you are talking about, I hear you. I was speaking as a whole overall series. Even when Stabler was there. I can promise you the goal isn’t the “craving to fit it in Hollywood” (in fact I’m moving very soon).  It’s the craving to fix a real life issue ♥️
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump All good love. When I sang “Play With Fire...” it was to one of the disgusting men who assaulted me shortly after I moved to LA. That was why I almost choked a time or two mid-song.  I was reliving that trauma when I sang the song live.
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump Is to get justice. So yes, I commend the writers and actors bc they do their job so well that I CONNECT. Rape, abuse and assault are very real and happen all to often. Lastly, I appreciate your insight, though I think you may have misconstrued what that post was.
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump Lastly, (not that it’s everyone’s business) but as a woman who has been sexually harassed and assaulted  I think I have every right to compliment the writers of the show, because they are on point. I know from experience how horrible you feel after the fact and how difficult it
@ToddTsoupysales @nbcsvu @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza @realDonaldTrump Dear @ToddTsoupysales, first I want to say thank you for following the Idol journey and for purchasing my music, that lights me up :) I do also want to point out that I wasn’t referring to politics at all, though I know which episode you are referring to.
Binge watching @nbcsvu. I can’t stop. Brilliant cast and always heart string pulling relevant storylines. Well done all around to the writers, directors &amp; everyone who makes this show work, love you all. @Mariska @PeterScanavino @FINALLEVEL @KelliGiddish @RaulEEsparza ♥️

Correction: @nic_Ville your post makes no sense. Really? You're standing up for someone who is doing something rude &amp; disrespectful?
@nic_Ville my point was her disgusting reaction to the situation not the uber issue. watch her video then it will make sense.

@maximumpop @KendallJenner you try uber driving for a few days and see it from their shoes. It's not easy. These people work really hard.
@maximumpop @KendallJenner the fact that you would rant about this makes you look like you feel the world was designed to be your servant
@maximumpop @KendallJenner in the time you cancelled the driver could have picked up other riders &amp; they only have to wait 2 mins for you..
@maximumpop @KendallJenner  they are under no obligation to pick you up - have some respect for people who work hard for their money
@maximumpop @KendallJenner @uber doesn't pay enough &amp; if the driver is trying to meet a bonus &amp; you are holding them up they lose time &amp; $$
@maximumpop @KendallJenner not only that- every time u cancel your passenger rating goes down &amp; this is how the driver hardly makes a living
@maximumpop @KendallJenner usually @uber only bans the worst of the worst. It's actually really hard to get banned by Uber.
