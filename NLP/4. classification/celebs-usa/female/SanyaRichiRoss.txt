@MekaylaDarlin what same mistake?
@steveortega1 no woman I know wanted to be in this situation. I pray God forgives you for your sins
@MekaylaDarlin we all make mistakes. Getting pregnant was a mistake but I'm so grateful my God isn't like u and He forgives!!!
@christy13489 @JustCallMeNOLE definitely not a glamour moment! The toughest moment of my life. One I still struggle with today.
@chrimyer it's funny how you'd throw the bronze medal in my face.... you should have greater empathy as a man of God. Have a great day.
@chrimyer I'm not celebrating it. I'm being honest and willing to share the moment in my life that God showed up for me the most.
@chrimyer no I asked for his forgiveness
@chrimyer i believe God has forgiven me for this! Don't need acceptance from anyone else!!!

.@africansupastar I went for it. Gave it everything I had n I can't be disappointed. Was a tough final season 4 me, but grateful for it all
.@africansupastar unfortunately I think overcompensating on my toe caused the hamstring injury... But such is life.
.@africansupastar had a third surgery on my toe in November, started my training in February then pulled my hamstring right before trials.
Most of the times,@PynkMartini, it's a mental lapse. You feel a sense of relief that you've made it to the line &amp; you slow down prematurely
