A breach so far beyond drug dealers at the highest level. U aren‚Äôt expected to trust that ur drug dealer has your best interest at heart. This is fucked-up hard-core crime, betrayal &amp; an oath ripped in half. Greed is dangerous &amp; ALWAYS demands to come before people https://t.co/gyM08N3FVG

@mang0ld I mean I‚Äôm a full grown woman. But inside ai‚Äôm just a lil girl. Like all of us. And I‚Äôm tryin to take care of her, ya know?
@ModernWood @mang0ld Hm. Well-energy is catchy. (Like my last tweet was pretty neg. Not my best self) but pos energy spreads too. So the metric would just be the feeling in the air. The change in group think. Less boners from rage  &amp; more boners from love, connection &amp; getting the best out of people
@iwriterealgood Or just a piece of art from the Vatican. Just that. I bet @Pontifex would be so down. He‚Äôs pretty lovely.
@mang0ld Yes -totally - I truly love giving thoughts and advice and sharing everything I‚Äôve learned.  It just can be embarrassing/horrifying if I misunderstand that that‚Äôs why I was asked out to eat.
Don‚Äôt *network* with me. I don‚Äôt  do that shit. Don‚Äôt take me to lunch to ‚Äòpick my brain‚Äô my heart can‚Äôt take it

Look- Trump does so many shitty things- I ain‚Äôt lookin to spread petty  lies about the guy tho. All I care about is what is TRUE.
Like, remember that vid of Trump dumping all the fish food into the koi pond like a dick? Well @snopes taught me that that WASN‚ÄôT the whole video- before Trump did that the PM of Japan did it first.
Help save Snopes! The last vestige of nonpartisan truth. No agenda, no sides - they don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything but what is TRUE. https://t.co/1KrYZlSJ5h

@rudrayogini @tomwatson WOW. Amazing article. Whoo bummer. Thanks for showing me this.
@tomwatson Fuck I love the guy so maybe I‚Äôm skewed. He has a D-rating from NRA. When I say it‚Äôs not an NRA thing- his vote may have been wrong but it was out of devotion to his constituents, not to the NRA. You at LEAST must know Bernie is not bought
This is actual true (WHAT liberal bubble???) üòú‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è https://t.co/pOtcPDiGaN
@SarahThyre @SenSanders @ILYAmerica He has like a D- rating from the NRA and voted to eliminate auto assault rifles and to have background checks.  His record is bc he reps Vermont - a low crime state filled w hunters. But ya I‚Äôm from NH we had guns at CAMP-It‚Äôs fucking insane
@itsmebeccam @SarahLerner Can you show me? No tude- genuinely wanna see Hillary acknowledging that. (Look I voted for her!)
Jeanne Shaheen NOOOOOO! https://t.co/3gxoBE0iJI
@SarahLerner Oh cool. I didn‚Äôt see that one bc the other one got picked up. Glad to see. Lemme know how your honest reckoning goes. You should see the bad choices I‚Äôve made. There are LOTS. You‚Äôll need to reckon me as well.
??Vermont is a hunting state. It was never an NRA thing.  But he has changed w the times &amp; has been fighting for gun reform. Hillary was outspoken *against* gay marriage until she wasn‚Äôt. Now she is an lgbti champion &amp; that‚Äôs awesome. To be changed IS progress. Y look2divide us? https://t.co/SktHC28QhT
Hey @wkamaubell my shrink was so moved by your piece at San Quentin he wept as he described it to me and then I did too.  When u ask how he can live in such a small space &amp; he says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs what is.‚Äù Thats deep shit for real. ‚ô•Ô∏è

It‚Äôs a classic buddy movie formula:  The only thing that will bring Israel &amp; Palestine together is a common enemy. I am willing to be that common enemy. My name will be Xylatron.  IM XYLATRON AND IM COMING TO GIT YOU, MIDDLE EAST!!!  RAAAARRRRRR!!!

@JustHallel Ya! Palestine= East Jerusalem&amp; Gaza &amp; West Bank, (but let Israelis visit bc it‚Äôs spesh2them)  Maybe even 1 day have each other‚Äôs backs?  No more occupation from israel, no more ‚Äúkill all Jews‚Äù/jihad from Hamas, just love &amp; forgiveness &amp; seeing ourselves in each other. K done.
@TheHipsterRebbe @cvaldary Thanks bro. You may not be familiar with me. I talk to all sorts of perspectives. And we challenged each other. my show has one Israeli EP and one Palestinian EP.  But please don‚Äôt tell me who to speak to. I‚Äôm a full grown woman and I know what I‚Äôm doing, k boo
@TheHipsterRebbe @cvaldary Thank you for this I think the exchange is lovely. I associate with whoever the fuck (I say this w love ) I wanna. And I think if you need to shield yourself from people with other ideas &amp; perspectives in order to keep ur own beliefs in tact, u should probably wonder about that

@cjwerleman @PeterCorless True. And im@glad they updated it! But they did so because they started running people for Office and had to. I say this just as another nuance to keep in mind -not to negate the effort...

@cjwerleman Hold up is that true?? I need to read a translation. I‚Äôve always been told this by people I love and trust. One way to find out! Deep dive baby brb
@cjwerleman @DaveChappelle Also- until all are free, what can change?
@cjwerleman Until we see ourselves in each other instead of evil and righteous faceless entities - what can really change?  @DaveChappelle ‚Äòs piece on the end of apartheid in South Africa in his special ‚ÄúThe Bird Revelation‚Äù is inspiring &amp; makes me hopeful for Palestine/Israel‚ù§Ô∏ècheckitout
@cjwerleman Hamas‚Äôs mission statement including ‚Äúkill all Jews‚Äù adds nuance, no? Again- they don‚Äôt represent all people either But it makes it scarier for some to let go &amp; see what‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm NO expert OBVIOUSLY- I‚Äôm interested in truth &amp; justice but I can‚Äôt speak like I know what I don‚Äôt
@cjwerleman I think the struggle w some of my Jewish brothers and sisters is it‚Äôs very scary bc it takes very little 4 people to hate all Jews. Some are too scared to see the hypocracy in what that very fear is creating.  So many israelis are fighting with you. Please amplify them too
@cjwerleman I didn‚Äôt apologize- I want her free! I want all Palestinians 2B free- no human should be not free &amp; no people should oppress others.  There IS some chicken and egg-i-ness and there is nuance &amp; we both know govts oft don‚Äôt represent the hearts of its people.
