@zoebritton Do your thing mama. I’m undecided as of now. I think if he ran as an independent people would be way more angry and rightly so. He does not want to split votes. I think that’s actually very team player of him as it was then. IMO

How y’all loving @AOC But crapping all over Bernie? Saying “he’s not a real democrat”. I’m flummoxed. Anyway, who knows what will happen there are so many great ones stepping up and more we don’t even know of yet!
What’s peep’s prob w Bernie runnin? Lots of goodins throwin their hat in the ring.  The angle that he is  responsible for Trump is straight BANANAS. He ran as a dem SO THAT he wouldn’t  split the vote, and when Hillary was the nominee he travelled the country campaigning 4 her.
In his defense he meant to post it on 4Chan... https://t.co/CgZ0o1ttNl
@kat_blaque Wow! Been using it wrong. I learned it from Dolores Huerta.  So would you say that Intersectionality isn’t something you do but something you INFER?
@brandondarby Interesting piece, Brandon. My only guess is there were several mass shootings in the states - I think 3 last week- with “official” sources that also barely got covered. But I read ur piece &amp; assuming that stuff is rampant, it shows why people there’d wanna find refuge here❤️
@InvisibleChimp Yes!! The study shows that when out on the defensive, or infused with fear people across the board (lib and cons) make conservative choices, when put at ease and safe secure feelings, they (across the board) make liberal choices
Our government is doing this to humans.  This is non partisan issue. We have to join together to stop this. We are punishing children for seeking safety. https://t.co/wvVbFI4epg

@LeoRules1 @AmarilloKenja @phoenixkhost It’s a reaction to what we are seeing. How do you see these pictures and not want to stop it?   How is everyone’s child not your child?
@LeoRules1 @shoeluver67 That’s what you get from watching this monologue or is that what you get from reading the headline of your right wing blog? You are closed, friend. Locked shut. I think there is more in you. I think you can get nuance. So either watch it all or don’t comment bc u didn’t see
@phoenixkhost @LeoRules1 Ha wrong. Your vision of my life is wrong. 1 br apartment baby.
@LeoRules1 @AmarilloKenja @phoenixkhost No I think we’ve all been acknowledging that. It’s a heinous stain that Trump took and made even worse by his policy of separating parents and babies.
@LeoRules1 @daniepedia Touché my friend. That said- even if the adults we are talking about were criminals (they are not) their children aren’t and do not deserve to be in ice cold holding cells with foil sheets and a floor to sleep on and no love and care. Goodness gracious what are we arguing about?
@LeoRules1 @daniepedia Why are you hanging onto this? Criminals are criminals. Who is lying about seeking asylum? They want to live here. Give us your poor huddled masses bro. What makes you mad about immigrants you come from immigrants

I feel confident that most Jews would love a Jewish-themed met gala. Can’t speak 4 Islam tho I think prog sects of any religion would find this 2B a celebration.  In kind, I’d not be surprised if the more fundamentalist sects of said religions would take issue, like yourself ✌🏼 https://t.co/oO7wuvTV2G
The Vatican sponsored the event, and sent their own Sistine Chapel choir to New York to perform at the gala. The Vatican also loaned several sacred items from its own collection to the exhibit. Peace https://t.co/yylRgVG1jQ

Great piece on the hypocrisy of Jeff Sessions. It’s a very odd thing it seems only republican politicians &amp; toddlers do: point to others &amp; accuse them of doing what they, themselves, did. https://t.co/hkNtngq1cP

Know what would get 2 Trump a million times more than any bad press? NO PRESS. Seems impossible, but y’all got t together to burn ER’s George Clooney that one time he complained (o shit that was paps. Never mind)
Replacing McMaster w Bolton tells me that Trump wants a war. Why? my guess 1)to distract, as always. 2)He jus wants to be a wartime president, ‘cause like, cool.   = 3) ego ego ego

@davidmweissman Nope!
@davidmweissman @wellmanten @LeeAnndelCasti2 @LadyPJustice Yes. Close your eyes and imagine your access to healthcare is taken away from you. Also imagine you are the primary caretaker of your children and have a job, and that if you want care u must find a babysitter, take a day off work and drive 10 hours there and back.
THIS https://t.co/QJGFRjjINK
@Sammeemcb Mine too! So many. Like us here in the US- the govt does not represent most of the people
@davidmweissman @wellmanten @LeeAnndelCasti2 @LadyPJustice It’s Pro CHOICE. It’s a woman’s body and it must be her choice what she does with it. NO MAN would tolerate legislation over his own body. See? Did u know the Sperm inside u has a sense of smell? But u murder millions of them every time u ejaculate. No one’s legislating THAT♥️

@MonicaLewinsky Exactly!

@mang0ld I mean I’m a full grown woman. But inside ai’m just a lil girl. Like all of us. And I’m tryin to take care of her, ya know?
@ModernWood @mang0ld Hm. Well-energy is catchy. (Like my last tweet was pretty neg. Not my best self) but pos energy spreads too. So the metric would just be the feeling in the air. The change in group think. Less boners from rage  &amp; more boners from love, connection &amp; getting the best out of people
@iwriterealgood Or just a piece of art from the Vatican. Just that. I bet @Pontifex would be so down. He’s pretty lovely.
@mang0ld Yes -totally - I truly love giving thoughts and advice and sharing everything I’ve learned.  It just can be embarrassing/horrifying if I misunderstand that that’s why I was asked out to eat.

Like, remember that vid of Trump dumping all the fish food into the koi pond like a dick? Well @snopes taught me that that WASN’T the whole video- before Trump did that the PM of Japan did it first.

@rudrayogini @tomwatson WOW. Amazing article. Whoo bummer. Thanks for showing me this.
@tomwatson Fuck I love the guy so maybe I’m skewed. He has a D-rating from NRA. When I say it’s not an NRA thing- his vote may have been wrong but it was out of devotion to his constituents, not to the NRA. You at LEAST must know Bernie is not bought
This is actual true (WHAT liberal bubble???) 😜♥️♥️ https://t.co/pOtcPDiGaN
@SarahThyre @SenSanders @ILYAmerica He has like a D- rating from the NRA and voted to eliminate auto assault rifles and to have background checks.  His record is bc he reps Vermont - a low crime state filled w hunters. But ya I’m from NH we had guns at CAMP-It’s fucking insane
@itsmebeccam @SarahLerner Can you show me? No tude- genuinely wanna see Hillary acknowledging that. (Look I voted for her!)
Jeanne Shaheen NOOOOOO! https://t.co/3gxoBE0iJI
@SarahLerner Oh cool. I didn’t see that one bc the other one got picked up. Glad to see. Lemme know how your honest reckoning goes. You should see the bad choices I’ve made. There are LOTS. You’ll need to reckon me as well.
??Vermont is a hunting state. It was never an NRA thing.  But he has changed w the times &amp; has been fighting for gun reform. Hillary was outspoken *against* gay marriage until she wasn’t. Now she is an lgbti champion &amp; that’s awesome. To be changed IS progress. Y look2divide us? https://t.co/SktHC28QhT

@TheHipsterRebbe @cvaldary Thank you for this I think the exchange is lovely. I associate with whoever the fuck (I say this w love ) I wanna. And I think if you need to shield yourself from people with other ideas &amp; perspectives in order to keep ur own beliefs in tact, u should probably wonder about that

@cjwerleman @DaveChappelle Also- until all are free, what can change?
@cjwerleman Until we see ourselves in each other instead of evil and righteous faceless entities - what can really change?  @DaveChappelle ‘s piece on the end of apartheid in South Africa in his special “The Bird Revelation” is inspiring &amp; makes me hopeful for Palestine/Israel❤️checkitout
@cjwerleman Hamas’s mission statement including “kill all Jews” adds nuance, no? Again- they don’t represent all people either But it makes it scarier for some to let go &amp; see what’s right. I’m NO expert OBVIOUSLY- I’m interested in truth &amp; justice but I can’t speak like I know what I don’t
@cjwerleman I think the struggle w some of my Jewish brothers and sisters is it’s very scary bc it takes very little 4 people to hate all Jews. Some are too scared to see the hypocracy in what that very fear is creating.  So many israelis are fighting with you. Please amplify them too
@cjwerleman I didn’t apologize- I want her free! I want all Palestinians 2B free- no human should be not free &amp; no people should oppress others.  There IS some chicken and egg-i-ness and there is nuance &amp; we both know govts oft don’t represent the hearts of its people.
