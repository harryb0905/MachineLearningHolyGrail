@VirginAtlantic @richardbranson 30 hour update: after being assured by two depts that 1 bag was on the 4 pm flight (it wasn’t) and then that it was on the 7 pm flight, no one called to confirm its arrival so I know nothing. Other bag still missing. #thonggate #asifiwouldwearathong

@VirginAtlantic @richardbranson Thank you but in the morning will be approx 44 hours later while several VA flights have left Heathrow without my suitcases on them. I’m the child of immigrants, I know hard work and this isn’t it. 😂
.@richardbranson I love @VirginAtlantic. The crew are always lovely, cabins are clean and movie selection is good. This is atypical of all my experiences on VA. Also, I don’t have underwear.
24 hours later, still no sign of my luggage from @VirginAtlantic. @richardbranson May I borrow a  toothbrush?
.@VirginAtlantic please locate my luggage at Heathrow and put it on another airline. Several Virgin flights have now flown without my bags, it’s been 20 hours so please just put it on another airline.
@VirginAtlantic I took your advice, called back, asked for a manager. There isn’t one on duty. No one answered that line for 10 hours, now no manager on duty? Bags still missing. Please call me.
@VirginAtlantic Will you please check your DMs? I need assistance, it’s now been too long trying to get people to call me back.
@VirginAtlantic Thank you for your response, please check DM.
.@VirginAtlantic 18 hours of your unapologetic staff without information or solutions, I’m sorry to reach out publicly, will you please contact me regarding lost luggage?

@richgirl_ @Visa @TransLink No, the point of #TimesUp is that all this behavior must end. All men in power harassing women must end. It’s all a cancer, all at different stages, some curable, some not. But still, has to be cut out.

@richgirl_ @Visa @TransLink Guess what? I’ve had too many jobs taken from me and my voice literally silenced by two men, one who sexually assaulted me and one who physically threatened me. I struggled to write my way out of that hole, and did.  #TimesUp

@FACLC no reference to the clothing being provocative. It's always applied to women, as if we're "asking for it." It's sexism.
@FACLC Sarkozy flat out called the burkini a "provocation". The media reported that quote.
@FACLC Those aren't facts, they're contortions of truth. You're condoning posting a photo of an ape on a black woman's website.
@FACLC Leslie Jones didn't send racist tweets, she was hacked, then attacked. Get the facts straight on your hate.
From birkini banning to website nude pic hacks, we are still under attack for being women.
