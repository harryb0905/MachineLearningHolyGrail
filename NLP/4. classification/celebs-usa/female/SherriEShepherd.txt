@iamwandasykes I would really Love to march &amp; protest injustice with you but what do we do when we gotta go to the bathroom?  #AARPproblems
@becuziwantto @Starbucks Mmmm hmmmm exactly
@almarie_howard @Starbucks yes! At comedy clubs there are signs everywhere that say in order to see the show you must purchase min 2 drinks
@sassysonj hah!  My money goes to @officedepot ‚Ä¶ @Staples has been wiped off my radar
@STFUImTweetn0_o and I am willing to bet a number of ‚Äúpeople‚Äù use that very same @starbucks and don‚Äôt order &amp; nothing negative happens üò≥
This is why clear signsR needed/ because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcustomary‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean all know especially if diff in other states https://t.co/rOSEaGCJwg
Then it should be across the board ‚Ä¶ or clear signage stating this.  This is the exact problem I had w @Staples https://t.co/U4co5pumpV
@theqvl @Starbucks then it should be across the board for this privately owned company - if you can‚Äôt do it in Philly you can‚Äôt do it in CA
According to @starbucks company policy in Philly &amp; some other states you cannot wait unless you purchase something  https://t.co/Z4xHhtn2po
@MsCheleGhi @Starbucks the manager says he asked them to leave &amp; they wouldn‚Äôt so SIX police officers had to come and handle
If @Starbucks doesn‚Äôt have a sign that says one needs to purchase before using their facilities &amp; the policy differs at each store #really
@Starbucks you‚Äôre not  franchised in the U.S.  so you have certain policies in some cities that differ from other cities - I am confused
@Starbucks says it‚Äôs their policy in Philly &amp; other cities to require customers to purchase something in order to sit or use their bathroom
@kewilbur @lcheslerclark @Starbucks @PhillyPolice yes look at the video @ @missydepino
I‚Äôve had wonderful experiences w some @Starbucks employees but the name on the awning says #STARBUCKS so CEO #KevinJohnson needs2 step up
@natsips @Starbucks the barista represents #Starbucks ‚Ä¶
@PRASAD326 in the U.S. @Starbucks is not franchised therefore their policies must be uniform &amp; across the board https://t.co/A7F7mZudDE
All this talk of @Starbucks makes me want @DunkinDoughnuts ‚Ä¶ wonder if they have free WiFi &amp; a place for my laptop to wait4 @iamwandasykes
@ErickTrump @mommymagic42 @rspyke @missydepino @Starbucks https://t.co/7fB0u5ifB5
@LisaAnnWalter Not one of them has ever been asked to leave @Starbucks nor been arrested - guess out of work actors just aren‚Äôt threateningüò≥
There‚Äôs a guy  @Starbucks near me-takes up entire corner w his computer &amp; papers sometimes he never orders-no one threatened just irritated
@LisaAnnWalter @Starbucks They were released at close to 2am.  I see people all the time @Starbucks who haven‚Äôt ordered - there‚Äôs a man in my hood that comes in &amp; makes the place his personal office &amp; WiFi zone
I understand asking people2 leave if they‚Äôre not purchasing but @Starbucks you must do that across the board NOBODY can be allowed to do it
@starbucks that‚Äôs not enough.  Did you even find out the ‚Äúindividuals‚Äô‚Äù names? The humiliation they suffered? https://t.co/Zt2en6nhve
@SaikoWoods respectfully ‚Ä¶ You can send your video @Starbucks ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd be a great spokesperson for them ‚Äúshow me the proof of racism‚Äù
From an @Starbucks employee on their training guidelines ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúeven if the want to enjoy the ambience w/o buying‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TbvQgmOHQX
@SaikoWoods cops have the power to use discretion.  Arrest? vs asking someone to leave? And I am blaming @Starbucks  https://t.co/YYgUojuCQJ
@SaikoWoods @Starbucks This makes no sense.  We are going to agree to disagree - We will both brush the dirt off our feet and go our separate ways.  God bless you
@SaikoWoods @Starbucks But the two black me. @Starbucks weren‚Äôt asked to leave.  The police were called bc an employee felt threatened and they were arrested!
#PhilandoCastile was shot by an officer in front of his daughter &amp; girlfriend &amp; she was ‚Ä¶ you need to ask ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs Proof‚Äù of racism?
The fact that the @Starbucks employee felt threatened by 2 unarmed black men who were waiting for a friend &amp; called the police. Look inward
In the video @missydepino shot @Starbucks of two black men getting arrested you can clearly hear WHITE people saying they did nothing wrong
@SaikoWoods you keep asking where is the proof of racism that 2 black men were arrested by 6 officers for sitting in @Starbucks w/o ordering
@iamwandasykes seriously!
@browngriselda53 bye
@Jacquisimpson19 Ahhh... there are times I miss being on @TheView ... this is one of them! üôèüèæ
The facts @SaikoWoods the two men who were arrested were released bc apparently being black while not ordering @Starbucks is not a crime
I don‚Äôt want2 instill fear into my son but when common instances keep getting black men shot/killed #StephonClark #BrennanWalker #tamirrice
watch the video @missydepino shot of the black men arrested @Starbucks - you see the outrage of white people ‚Ä¶ not just me screaming ‚Äúrace‚Äùüò≥
@MissMandyHale I. Can‚Äôt. With. You. Today ‚ô•Ô∏è
@LoydfrDetroitt @Starbucks in Philadelphia - 18th &amp; Spruce
@tanishalockett‚Ä¶ the officers are suppose to assess the situation &amp; can use their discretion - they could have asked them2 leave but arrest?
You talked about the anxiety of being a black man @elonjames having2 appear unthreatening -having2 ‚Äúexplain‚Äù that you‚Äôre just waiting4 some1
The fact that whomever called the police bc they felt ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù by these two young men who BTW looks like my nephews is disturbing
And before you start admonishing me as a Christian @SaikoWoods ... remember #Jesus went into the temple and saw vendors.  He immediately turned over a few tables in anger - TODAY that would‚Äôve gotten him shot https://t.co/hFj12M0o9L
@SaikoWoods @Starbucks I think you need to read @missydepino‚Äôs tweet.  She was there and observed the entire incident.  They were released. How many people do you see sitting @Starbucks for HOURS who don‚Äôt order anything? They don‚Äôt get arrested
This treatment of two black men who were sitting @Starbucks but hadn‚Äôt ordered anything &amp; were arrested by SIX police officers is shameful!  Is this what I must now teach my son? You don‚Äôt have the same rights as your counterparts-be docile or you could be killed? Bye #Starbucks https://t.co/r7CcVua9gE

@mssusangb @Staples it is a bathroom for customers‚Äô use &amp; I was a customer who was told I needed to go to #RiteAid - &amp; cursed at by cashier
New president @Staples.  J. Alexander Douglas - are you aware your company racially profiles customers - wouldn‚Äôt let us use their bathroom
Embarrassed that a @Staples cashier would hurl obscenities at my girlfriend &amp; I after racially profiling us.  What if I had been w my son?
@BTerri64 @Staples I reported the cashier who cursed at us to Edgar the #mgr - he said she probably said bc the bathrooms needed2B cleaned
upset @Staples cashier telling me she isn‚Äôt going2 take this f+{uking sh%}t from me when I asked why she wouldn‚Äôt let me use their bathroom
You were bought for $6.9 billion dollars @Staples by #SycamorePartners - you think you could train your employees to be racially sensitive
Hello Public @Staples has employees who racially profile &amp; then when confronted scream obscenities - thank you Edgar the manager
@Staples cashier racially profiled &amp; sent us2 #RiteAid 2use bathroom-we walked all way 2RiteAid 2find out she lied. She screamed obscenities
@Staples i ‚Äúgathered‚Äù that the bathrooms weren‚Äôt broken bc another employee gave us the code to get in &amp; we used it - the cashier lied
@Staples store at 4641 Santa Monica Blvd - Mgr is Edgar &amp; cashier is Janice who screamed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna let you f*{%king talk2 me like that‚Äù
@Staples if this is a reflection of how your employees treat customers lying &amp; screaming obscenities at them, I will never shop at UR store
The @Staples at 4641 Santa Monica Blvd in Los Angeles just discriminated against my friend &amp; I just because of the way we looked
Cashier @Staples just starts screaming profanities at my girlfriend &amp; I and walks off the register - I have NEVER been treated w profanity
Told @Staples cashier I was buying &amp; she should‚Äôve stated the policy she then starts screaming ‚ÄúI am not going to take this SH*T from you‚Äù
I checked bathroom @Staples &amp; it wasn‚Äôt broken - asked cashier why she lied &amp; she said their policy is to not let people use who don‚Äôt buy
At @Staples w my girlfriend buying a notebook asked 2use bathroom&amp; was told we need to go to #RiteAid bc toilets were broken - they weren‚Äôt

@maria_spain22 even if I'd wired money... most hotels don't take cash &amp; you need cc for incidentals-we went on @AirbnbHelp's word = CRAP! https://t.co/ntU5hSCvr9
@airbnb @airbnbhelp told me they'd credit my card for the $700 scam, I've yet2 see it reflected... so now I gotta deal w them to get $$ back
Thankfully I found someone2 take my sister &amp; niece in-but this entire experience w @airbnb &amp; @airbnbhelp has been nothing short of nightmare
Eventually after multiple calls to @AirbnbHelp they talked to hotel but by then all rooms were booked &amp; she and niece were outside in cold
when my sis got @airbnbhelp on phone, they said they'd reimburse her but wouldn't pay for the hotel-bc she couldn't pay she was asked2 leave
@airbnbhelp - I told them she had no credit card &amp; they said no problem-then hotel demanded payment AND a card-couldn't get @airbnb on phone
@AirbnbHelp assured me bc of me getting scammed they would secure hotel 4the nite for my sis &amp; niece- it didn't happen &amp; they were stranded

I told @AirbnbHelp that my sis didn‚Äôt have $$ 4 a hotel and they said she didn‚Äôt need NOW you‚Äôre saying you won‚Äôt pay you‚Äôll only reimburse
@Airbnb U told my sister &amp; niece 2go2 a hotel free of charge - hotel is charging her &amp; is now sold out - she &amp; her daughter on the streets!
I sent an @Uber to get my sis to the hotel you directed her to go @AirbnbHelp &amp; hotel is saying she has to pay - she doesn‚Äôt have enough $$
And now @AirbnbHelp the hotel is asking my sis &amp; 11yr old niece to leave - they won‚Äôt take my cr card over the phone!  Shame on you @airbnb
@AirbnbHelp  they‚Äôd get my sis &amp; niece a hotel 4the nite since they were stranded - the hotel is demanding they pay - way to go @airbnb
Because I got scammed on @AirbnbHelp my sis &amp; 11yr niece are stranded &amp; on the streets &amp; I can‚Äôt get to them - they‚Äôre asking her 2pay $$
@airbnb you promised my sister &amp; niece a free paid nite at hotel bc of me getting scammed thru UR company -now  hotel is demanding she pay
I swear to the mountaintops @AirbnbHelp  now has my sister and her daughter stranded at 11pm at nite bc they messed up AGAIN!

@ardly2 oh yeah @GeorgeLopez should grow up üëÄ &amp; what about this comic   https://t.co/lE21XENW3R https://t.co/uVCR2uEaxY
@TheReader23 a comic goes ballistic on a heckler (more common than you‚Äôd think)  https://t.co/OxDoEG2GQ2
This is for you @photografitti90 watch a heckler get destroyed by a comedian (graphic) https://t.co/lE21XENW3R https://t.co/YqeRo2GMHH
You‚Äôre funny.  Try going up in a black comedy club w hecklers ‚Ä¶  you‚Äôll learn how to handle hecklers https://t.co/N5m3uXYcS1
LOL I am not being biased ‚Ä¶ however I am a comic &amp; know how hard it is on that stage https://t.co/IKSeml9wWm
Exactly‚Ä¶ when you heckle a comic you have started the fight https://t.co/svNY3raNhF
@Samawatii obviously you‚Äôve never seen a Joe Torry‚Ä¶ or the slew of comics I‚Äôve come up with‚Ä¶ yes I‚Äôve seen it be worse
Racist?  @georgelopez ?  Heck nooo‚Ä¶ Steve Bannon?  Yeah‚Ä¶ #justlaugh for goodness sake!
You don‚Äôt have time to  think ‚Äúthis poor heckler is going through it let me give her a hug and make her feel good‚Äù  https://t.co/7w5uPBTk4Q
I‚Äôve had hecklers talk about my boobs‚Ä¶ shout out crazy things - I have to shut them down by any means necessary https://t.co/7w5uPBTk4Q
If you go to a comedy show and you think you‚Äôre going to agree w everything said onstage then you should stay home https://t.co/7w5uPBTk4Q
@photografitti90 @georgelopez you might have tried to be nice &amp; supportive of heckler but she would‚Äôve kept itup &amp; then you‚Äôve lost control
It‚Äôs easy to sit back as a person who‚Äôs not onstage or a comic to sit and say how @georgelopez could‚Äôve handled - https://t.co/7w5uPBTk4Q
Love how my girl @amyschumer gets applauded for shutting her heckler down but @georgelopez gets dragged over the coals. They both weee right
A heckler is meant to be shut down so everyone else can enjoy the comic‚Äôs @georgelopez show.  They don‚Äôt want to be distracted either
If you‚Äôve never been onstage telling jokes &amp; never dealt w a heckler I challenge you to try it &amp; come back &amp; tell me how nicely you handled
Incredibly frustrating 2B onstage taking the audience on a journey &amp; some person who‚Äôs been drinking interrupts  https://t.co/OxDoEG2GQ2
If you heckle a comic in the middle of his/her joke bc you‚Äôre not listening a comic will go ballistic @georgelopez  https://t.co/OxDoEG2GQ2
Every comic handles  heckler in a diff‚Äôt way.  @georgelopez could‚Äôve went after her looks &amp; folks would still be mad https://t.co/2Uhdk39Sko
seen comics say worse to a heckler - you can conjecture all you want until you actually get onstage and get heckled https://t.co/SeZM81hzq2
And when a heckler disrupts a comics @georgelopez show, the comic must immediately shut heckler down or disable so that he/she can continue
The job of a comic onstage is to entertain ‚Ä¶ a heckler is a coward who wants attn but doesn‚Äôt have the balls to get up onstage &amp; do same
When a comic @georgelopez is giving folks a show they paid $$$ for &amp; you disrupt it then you get what you get - you don‚Äôt like it then leave
Had the woman who heckled @GeorgeLopez listened to his entire joke b4 she arbitrarily started in on him maybe she would‚Äôve had a good time
So sick of hearing that my friend @GeorgeLopez is a racist ‚Ä¶ he joked about his family &amp; their racist beliefs &amp; was heckled b4 he finished
