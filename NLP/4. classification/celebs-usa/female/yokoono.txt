Keep your mind empty so important ideas come through. Many is too much and it doesn't get to be anything. You are aware of that. Therefore, you panic and vigorously seek inspiration to give you the one idea that is important to you now. It will come to you if you are not seeking.

You don't have to go to art school to become an artist.
If I ever get a chance for a holiday, I walk longways wherever I am and breathe deeply in a silence within me.
Healing is always working right from the beginning of a disaster even when you don't think it is working. But if you kept grieving, the process of healing will slow down.
Stimulate your collective inspirations by creating a place for discussions - starting with you and your friends - with artists and and non-artists alike.

Your life is not falling apart. It is changing. Make it into a good change by knowing that it may be a blessing in disguise. Think differently for your survival.
Nothing and nobody is discouraging you except yourself. Keep trying to make a better world for you and us. We don't have the luxury to get discouraged. When you are drowning, don't comment with negative thoughts. Just do whatever you can to get to the surface and breathe.
We have to make our own fate. And when we do, or decide to do, all sorts of help comes to us. Every project, therefore, is a miracle.
We wrote and put out a song called POWER TO THE PEOPLE. It's happening. Time is a concept we human beings created. It doesn't matter if it's happening in a big way now after 40 years or so. 40 years can be forever, if we don't do anything about it. It can be 4 minutes if we did.

HOMAGE TO YOKO ONO*, by George Maciunas, Jan. 11, 1962 *the diagram says "YOKO ONO" in case you can not figure it out. Diazotype sheet: 8¾ x 5⅞" (22.2 x 15 cm) https://t.co/YavjzUtVNP
I've got 85 years of memory as I am still in my childhood. Which part of the memory would you like me to share with you?
Anything that is cooked with love and eaten with love is good for your body and soul. Cook when you love to cook. Eat when you are feeling love for yourself and the Universe. Then you are in the right direction. Don't cook or eat anything that gives you doubt and fear.
Keep loving yourself, all things natural on our planet, and the Universe. Keep counting your blessings. Keep the silence within you. Pretty soon, you will be full of joy. Your joy will be infectious. We spread love instead of hate.
Many people are starting to feel that "YES!" we can create a beautiful world together. People are finally standing up to let the politicians know that they will not stand for political lies and stupidity which do not help the human race, and the nature of our planet.
Education and communication are the key to finally ending all conflicts. When everybody becomes aware of what the real situation is, nobody will be working for the bully or the bullies who are trying to control the people with lies. Once that happens, the bully will be powerless.
Some artists consider small messages to be trivia. They ignore them and wait for a huge symphonic message to hit them. I tend to pick small messages as quiet as a whisper and make something out of them... It works.
Sometimes it's nice to be a needle in a haystack rather than not existing at all. I have been a needle in a haystack for the longest time, and have enjoyed being a needle.

When travelling, just be yourself and it will be alright. People do not necessarily love a person just because they are fluent in the language. In fact, you will probably be surprised that you will make more friends as you are. It makes people want to help you more.
Never say anything negative about your child. Just keep telling the child how great he/she is in so many ways. The old idea of be strict to a child, don't compliment the child too much, you might spoil the child by doing that…. is nonsense.

There is no such thing as failing, unless you intentionally did something mean to yourself or others. People tend to be sweet to somebody who tried and failed, and more nasty to somebody who seemed to have had a success that they envy.  #AntiBullyingWeek
Don’t go too near nasty people. They might be people who get angry if you go too near. So just keep a peaceful distance, and give a polite nice smile or peaceful wink. Or demonstrate a T-Shirt that says something nice to the person. They think nobody loves them. #AntiBullyingWeek

Don't be angry that someone is bullying you. It is their problem and not yours. If you don't make it your problem, it won't be. #AntiBullyingWeek
When you get angry, just say: "I love you, I forgive you, I accept you unconditionally." You are saying this to yourself. Keep saying this until you have had enough. You don't want to poison yourself, or the world. #AntiBullyingWeek
People who are mean to animals are mean to humans too. And you don't want your children to live in a world full of mean people. If you can eliminate people's indifference and violence towards animals, you are creating a world of love. Be kind. #AntiBullyingWeek #WorldKindnessDay
People who are fighting do not feel they are getting your understanding &amp; love. So send as much love as you can. When you send love to someone, you are automatically sending your love to yourself, our planet &amp; the Universe. So be extra careful what you think of. #AntiBullyingWeek

The war profiteers are strong because we allow them to confuse us and cause suspicion of each other. Divide and conquer. Their policy of deception, manipulation and intimidation is working. (4/7) https://t.co/NRzTJ1srXu
But then one must remember the soldiers’ families. How they cope with the change in their lives as a result of the loss – emotionally, physically, and financially. (3/7) https://t.co/UsLdNBluYV
In the wars of the 20th century approximately 62 million civilians have perished, while nearly 43 million military personnel were killed. Soldiers came second on the death list. (2/7) https://t.co/xwrKkXHLpz
In a war (which is another name for organized killing), civilians are the ones who suffer the most. Don’t be misled by euphemistic expressions such as ‘the attack was made with surgical precision.’  (1/7) https://t.co/XrMwUV3oFK

It is always love at first sight. You just perceive as such at the first time.
Change is life. Keep changing and it will be yours. Try not to change and it will lose you.
In any relationship, we put a lot of our energy to make it well. Relax. There is no stopping. It will always be there in some form. Don't be afraid of the change of form.
We are all magnets. We attract what we need to attract to us.

A thought will become a reality when we need it to be our reality. The future is dormant in the present as concepts.
You are questioning. That's a start. But don't just question. Do whatever you can do to bring about a harmonious world. This is not the time to question. This is the time to act with conviction - that we can save ourselves and our lovely planet.

Keep your compassion active. Don't be discouraged by people who take it badly. They will be missing something very precious they could receive if they accept it without fear.
We all receive valuable information every day from life. Advice is not information. It is given to you when the advisor has a personal need to give you the advice. I am always very careful about receiving advice.

I once advised in some writing of mine that what politicians should do is to first have a vocal lesson, and make their speeches by singing them. That way you would know the purity of what they are saying. I still think that is the political revolution we need.
Each time you remember and think of so-called great sayings by a great person, you are becoming a phony as you are having to rely on the great man/woman, and not yourself, so it kills your individuality and independence.
Music is in all our blood. Some of us just haven't discovered that yet.

We will be laughed at by other planets in the Universes if we keep fighting amongst ourselves.

Do we want to keep fighting and losing our soldiers, our resources and our finances? We will become uneducated people who destroyed our own culture, and lost our limbs (from mines or diabetes) and minds (from total fear and confusion).

With War, we could conquer and be able to colonize the defeated country and get everything we want from that country without paying much. Now, we cannot be thieves like that since the whole world has a way of watching.
How does one compete with pleasure and satisfaction once we have become mostly equal in our knowledge and intelligence?
https://t.co/clkbpryP6D
Nowadays, because of the incredible ability we have to communicate via the internet, our capacity for thought is equalising. We have access to so much information - for free!

We have a strong life force that precedes our desire for competition and warlike behaviour. Competition happens when we are not equal in our capacity to think.
Nietzsche died in 1900. I don't think he had a clear understanding of what was to come in the future in the 20th century and beyond. If anything, the future became full of things he had never thought of. Our future is the same. We don't know what will happen.

The best thing about chanting is that you don't think about anything else when you are doing it. No trivial or bad thoughts can get in there. It's a way to be no thoughts. And that is powerful. PEACE x
Find beauty in everything you touch. What is beautiful to you is what you love.
You are changing the world as you think and speak about it, in the way you are now speaking. You are doing your best, just by being you. So don't be too hard on yourself. I am only doing what I can do, too.

Art does many things to society, most of which is beneficial to all of us. It gives love, peace, healing, creates a desire in you to give, forgive, and have fun. It also helps you have good sex, too, as you may have experienced.

I'm afraid I don't have any guilty pleasures except eating sweets. I love sweets! Sounds like I'm quite a nerd, right?
What smells bring joy to my heart? The scent of sweet flowers, like gardenias. The smell of the salty waters of the ocean. The smell of the old bark of forest trees, and the smell of the green in the park. Of course, there's more. But these are just the ones that came to me.

How can we purge the government of warmongers? Trace the money back, and see who is profiting in result of the planned violence.
Start doing something good. It could be just cleaning out your old closet, or calling your Mom and give her a pep talk. Just anything you can do that is outside of yourself. It will make you feel a bit better. And then you will know what you have to do. Keep doing good things.
Let it be, and love and peace will grow from you and around you.

We have suffered what the world suffered. And we are wanting to change the world for the better because of it.
I get inspired by the beauty of the world. It is still beautiful. Let's not be destructive anymore. Let's love it’s beauty and enjoy it.
Thirty years ago, the world did not need too much from me in terms of activism. Now we need all the activists in the world to do something, and still it may not be enough.
Let's heal ourselves, and the world together. I am also young and upset about how the world is now. We've got to change it, and we will. Right?

Start to desire a simpler way of life. Forget entertaining each other and just love one another instead. We are already getting there. Our ability to entertain and surprise people about how clever we are by being rich and admired is a social convention rapidly losing its power.

Things which were good will definitely appear again. We are in an age where all of us are dying for more entertainment. We are just relying on things other people create. We just pay the admission fee and walk in. Are we forgetting to think for ourselves?

Remember, many feminists have followed the ways of men and hurt their health by drinking, smoking and pursuing more money and power by intense competition. Think of your health and think of being you instead of having an intense competition
Respect yourself first. Then you will stop thinking about the disrespectful. They are not worth thinking about.
Good art is something that touches you.
It's hard to forgive, but it is better to forgive, so you won't be carrying bad vibes yourself.
Your mind spreads your message before you even think about it. Trust in your soul and your body.
The soul exists in our hearts. It is what make us tick.

For Environmental Justice, we should go by what is good for the health of all species on Earth. It's crazy to say "listen we have a great way to make money, by causing unwanted destruction that may even poison and kill a few people by doing it."

Life can be terrible sometimes. In those really horrible times, I feel like I am drowning. So I try to come up and breathe.
You must work on what you love to work on... in my case it was music and art. Work is sacred. It saves you from sad thoughts. I have been wronged by the whole world. But I'm still here. Lies, ultimately, cannot destroy you, unless you join the liars.
Your life is being conducted in front of the world, like a play. Know that it is, therefore, a play to people who watch it.
Forgiveness - if you let it go and don't think about releasing your thoughts, it might make you understand that just being yourself and still being alive, is the sign that you are forgiving whatever you wish to forgive.
I love all colours when they are used in the right context.

The development of communication media has vastly changed. It's easier now for many artists who otherwise would have had a hard time to communicate their ideas.
Concepts come to you as a whole piece. Fragments, if they come as that, can be considered as independent whole pieces.
My memories of WW2 &amp; the bombing of Tokyo, Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki have strongly influenced 2 things I feel now 1 - That we can also survive this hard time we are all facing together And 2 - I don't want any of us, particularly our children, to suffer what I suffered during that War
If I could take you anywhere in the world it would be to inside your mind.
I have a strong wish. Guess what that is!
How about the International Court in the Hague give severe punishments to politicians who create war? Tax them billions. If they don't have billions, they should borrow and pay.
Violence and war waste and dissipate our energy and make us all poor and ill. I don't think people who are into violence and war think of that. They think violence and war will bring them power, money and energy. They will keep thinking that unless they see proof of what happens.

Each person has to think for him/her self what to do. And then it will work in the end.
Be yourself. That seems to work better in the end. Otherwise you'll exhaust yourself.
Darkness, silence and being left alone are all very important for your health. So you should give yourself such a time.

I think we should all have some belief we love. Some of us may believe in eating well. Some of us believe in making a big family. I personally believe in a walk. I do that even when it's raining a little. After a good walk, you really feel like you are cleansed spiritually.
I get my inner strength from constantly experiencing beauty in life. Beauty is what you love.
I'm always meditating - when I eat my lunch, when I'm crossing the street, when I'm just breathing...
Somebody told me not to take any advice. 'Think for yourself' - I thought that was a good one.

Mr. Kim Jong-in &amp; Mr. Moon Jae-in, I am so happy that you guys did it. I saw my husband, John Lennon, jumping around in space with joy. This I hope is the start of all countries shaking hands ½
Follow your instinct. Be an artist only if you have love for it. Then your work will spread your love to the world and make you happy as well. Listen to your instincts and not critics.

I love all trees, especially when I see one that is very, very old. I always wonder how it survived, and what it has seen in its life. I wish the tree could whisper to me all it knows!
The most healing location on this Earth is inside you.
I don't really play anything other than piano. But I love drumming.
I keep creating and I never stop to think whether I am creating something that gives me satisfaction. My life is in the act of creating and I have never stopped loving it.
Health of mind and body. The healing of all of us from the damage we have done to this planet and ourselves. That will give me joy.
I love dancing. My body starts to move when it hears any dance music. Doesn't stop moving until the music stops.

The tremendous curiosity I have for life is what is sustaining me. I feel I want to know more, and I know I will. Life is amazing, isn’t it?
When I was in the country during WW2 as a teenager, hungry, lonely, with no-one to depend on, I looked at the sky, and fell in love with it. It was shining in blue. Something about it made me feel alright. Since then, I rely on that feeling I had then, a long, long time ago.
Breathe deeply and tell yourself that you will survive. Move on. Spring is coming.
Don't be scared of being scared. Being scared is your protection. Use it well.
If you are being bullied, do not suffer privately. Connect with others who are bullied and create a united power. You can do it
If you want to find out what you can do to help change the world, you are already the solution. You are changing the world just by starting to think about what to do. The answer to what you should do will come from your heart.
Peace starts with having peace inside yourself.

Art is what you love. If you don't love it, you will never know what it is.
The thing that makes me feel good is the fact that there are more and more people believing in becoming artists. We artists can create a better world with good art.

Just like the weather, my days are full of unexpected situations. You think it will rain, and it doesn't. You think it will be a good day, and it showers! Well, that's life isn't it? We should know that life is exciting because it is strung with unexpectedness.
Love yourself, and live to stay as healthy as you can be. When you do that, your mind and your body will send love out without you trying. First, you must love yourself.
Many old eastern chants give me a strong feeling of healing. I love listening to them.
It happens to me in the tail end of a dream. I immediately wake up, jump up to find a pencil and a paper, and write down the inspiration.
It's yes if you make it yes.
Love does not choose. It's like water. It goes to wherever it's needed.
I don't think I care to critique what direction America has taken. I just want us to do what we can do now, to make things better.
Everything hurts. Because we are soft beings called humans.

Create things for the world you can only create when you are alone. All writers use such a moment to create. So on a subconscious level, your mind is telling you that you want to be alone for a good and positive reason.
Congratulations Ringo, it’s about time.  I love you! yoko https://t.co/6FPMCosGrd
If you are an introvert, that's not bad at all. Do work you cannot do when you have too many people around you. All writers wrote their books when they were alone. When you go to a bookshop and see the books on the shelves, think of the loneliness they used for their benefit.
Sean sent me a Valentine's day card when he was five years old with not just one heart but seven hearts all lined up. That's how he was from when he was a child.

We all have a strong connection to all the stars in the Universes. Can you feel it?
The leaders of each country are controlled by the military. They should come out &amp; say that. If we know the truth, it doesn't necessarily mean we can end guns and wars right away, but knowing the truth will do something to our brains, and it will know what to do. That's a start.

I have visited India. Indo-Buddhist concepts like karma are everywhere on Earth. Not just in India..
Not giving you up is the key.
Love and express your love. It will teach your children what they should learn.
My favorite place to go to is inside me.
Somebody being unpleasant to you is there to make you think.
Peace is happening now. More later, as well. Don't focus your mind on what is not happening. Focus on what is heppening. And it is, and will.
Be kind to yourself as much as you are to others and then suddenly you will see that your life is full of energy.
Time is a man made concept. Therefore, 'when' is not a relevant thing to think about. Just know that it will happen, yesterday or tomorrow.
The inspiration for my Wish Trees comes from my desire to make a wish together to better the world. The form comes from an old Japanese tradition in temples to tie a wish knot on a bush.
Instill love and peace in your children. It goes a long way.
I love you all and therefore it was very special that I got so many beautiful words from you on my birthday. Thank you thank you thank you. I feel very blessed. love, yoko https://t.co/WL2nSXVVtT
Ownership is a concept, since we don't take any of it with us. But it is an interesting concept. It is a way you express love - you are saying you own the part of that person or that thing by your understanding. I love what I know of you. I carry that in me, sweet!
Start with yourself. Be peaceful and loving. Give love to everything and everybody as if this is the last time you will be seeing them.
Falling down will make you wiser. And let you know that there's nowhere to go but up.
Listen to Menotti's ‘Telephone’ if you like to compose music and song. You will totally be inspired. ☎️ https://t.co/USb34QUc0M
Revolution #9 is about the life cycle. But If you saw that it was in order - starting with a baby crying and ending with death, that’s not how we did it. A life cycle can start at any point in time of life, even at death. Life, death &amp; love are sitting together with us every day.
Look at the steps we take when we walk. Our steps are made of floating and grounding, each time we take the step. You are grounding and floating, every day, as you walk. You should walk more.
Peggy Guggenheim was a dear friend. We were ageless girls who laughed a lot together. https://t.co/hj6gXmhwat
Think of something that is beautiful around you. Hold on to that beauty until you feel like smiling. Keep breathing deeply and keep smiling.
A man symbolizing our future was singing ‘We all shine on.” Yes. We will shine, but for that we have to take the blindfold off and stop knitting what we don’t know what we are knitting. It was my way of showing what we women must free ourselves from. #OTD https://t.co/IwSOPeBtqj
Life is what you make of it.
Believe in "WE." WE are a supreme power you cannot crush. You are part of "WE." WE are the family of the human race.
This year starts our awakening. Together, we are arriving at a supreme understanding. It's time for action. We know, and we will.
I cherish hearing the birds singing to wake us up.
Both John and I loved snow. We loved Central Park and we sledged down the hill laughing like kids.
Colour is very much like the black and white keys of the piano. That’s why you can create with just those notes without a band.
Music and art existed before you were born

The stars are beautiful. Let’s be thankful we are here to watch them
Wild animals should live the way they were meant to live - with freedom and dignity.
There is no such thing as the 'Other Side'. It's all what you are creating in your head to play the game of life as such. We are on the same side. All of us, and always.
Don't separate. Separation creates less power. Do everything with the utmost power you have… like showing understanding, and love.
There is always peace inside us. Listen to your heartbeat, and you will know.

Overcome your fear by changing a negative situation around into a positive one by yourself. When that's done, you will not only feel good about the situation (which is now positive) but you will also gain some self-respect for having turned around a bad situation by yourself.
Be alone, and you will feel that it is better to be with people. Be with people, and you will understand that being alone is not so bad.
A fearful situation is a challenge you have been given to make you stronger.
At the Women’s March, I was surprised that things were happening even better than I wished in 1971. It’s never too late to start from the start. read 'The Feminization Of Society'  https://t.co/l4c4hYOO0j  love, yoko #WomensMarch @WomensMarch
If you are angry, it will communicate and hurt.  If you love, it will communicate and heal.  Try to simmer down your anger; turn it into love with understanding, and then decide if you want to speak.
Every artwork deserves to be called art, when it has been made with the love of an artist.

Salsa, Tango, Rumba, Mambo! My body starts to dance just hearing those words!
Getting motivated doesn't mean that you should stick to it. Just let it go if you find something better. Life is too short to limit yourself to what you were motivated to do for a moment.
I like to save my energy for dreaming.
I come from the age when women were not suppose to crack jokes. I was advised not to, whenever I cracked one. Who's laughing now?
My performance was showing to the world what women go through. Chained to the world, blindfolded, and still working hard, knitting. https://t.co/dqgW9lKgNZ
Just for a moment, let's remind each other about love. https://t.co/uz5kXxLLF2 #ONOCHORD
Analyse less. Enjoy more.
Remind yourself that entertainment is not reality. If you replace reality with entertainment, you will become unreal.
Spread peace every day and never stop.
By using your ability to empathise with people, you can lessen feelings of depression. Try it.
Happiness is all around you. Just notice it and be thankful that you noticed it.
A drop in the ocean becomes a tsunami when there's enough. I am a drop in an ocean and very glad that I am.
Be thankful they don't know you too well. You can use that vacuum to be you and create what you want to create.
The world is not against you. They just don't know you well enough.
What you create will never be destroyed even if somebody tries to. They will all live in the conceptual world forever. So be careful about what you create.
Don't laugh at small things. Small things are important.  If you can keep creating small good things every day, it makes your life sweeter.
'WAR IS OVER! (If You Want It)' is a strong message to the world that we care about what is happening in the world, and we wish to reach you to let you know that we can stop the war. https://t.co/SqTb9UTMim

Peace is in our hearts. Nobody can take that away from us, except us. Inspiration comes to us when its necessary. These times are precisely when we get a lot of it.
If you send a sweet message, you will get sweet messages back tenfold. If you give out anger, you will get anger back tenfold. So just be careful. You are communicating more than you think.

A happy marriage is build by you watering it every day, like you water a plant. Of course, you must remember, like the plant, you can't keep watering it. Don't suffocate love.

I am very fortunate to feel so much love for almost everything. I don't know why that happened. Probably because I know the other side of life… very sad, very dangerous, and very painful.
My views have not changed since 'Bed Peace' In fact, I am more active in trying to spread the message. https://t.co/5Vk753LJW2

What is the most important thing in life? Breathing. Without it we would not be here.

To make a dream come true, start writing what you want. You'll be surprised that your mind actually knows exactly what you want. Start there.
Love yourself. You love something or somebody because you have love in yourself. Give that love to yourself as well, and you will stop feeling down.

Once you know that it's not good for your health to stay being upset, you will probably take a deep breath and go dancing!
Don't stop yourself from being upset. That's not your inner demons. Just you. You are human and allowed to be upset.
Let's count the stuff we conquered for our survival. Good solutions will always come to us at the right time.
We thought leprosy had no cure, AIDS had no cure. At one time, there was no hope for people who had lung disease, either.

Art communicates, spreads and covers the planet. It is a blanket of love.
An artistic expression is a success if it gives something to people which makes their lives easier.
I was an artist before I knew what artist meant. I was 4 years old.
I always believed in the magic of life, and still do. There was not one time I felt that the magic was gone.

You have not lost him. He is still inside you giving you his love wisdom and power. Be thankful that he was &amp; is in your life. I always do.
Don't feel alone. Having time to yourself is a big, big blessing. Think of all the great books that could never have been written!
In Vietnam, we maimed and killed civilians, especially children. In the name of what?

Without knowing the truth of what we are doing politically, we can never create a peaceful world.
What happened on 9/11 was terrible. So why are we bombing buildings in other countries? What is our religion? Democracy? Money?
What we give is pouring inside us, like a water in a tall cup. No way to stop it.

Our self expression is the reflection of our society. We mirror our world.
Having a baby at 42 was the nicest thing I did. Ask Sean.
Don't waste your precious energy on hate. It's not worth it &amp; will eat you up. Do something sweet and fun for yourself for your own health.
Have conviction in what you are doing.
Do three good things a day for three months and you will see that your life has changed entirely for the better.
My ultimate goal is to do my best every day, so when I am ready to pass away to the other side, I can say I did. And I see myself smiling.
We don't need to liberate ourselves from ourselves. We are all liberated deep inside us. Just noticing what you really are is enough.
Try to keep your head empty of terrible, mean, trivial thoughts. Inspiration will come in to help you to go to the next step.
Create with intuition, not conscious intent.
Even if you want to stick to an idea, if it doesn't work for you, it will change on its own accord. Be patient.
Imagine something beautiful. Your mind will become peaceful at that moment. A peaceful mind will attract peace, not fear.
Being lonely is not a derogatory state of mind. You see the beauty of the surroundings clearer. Count the stars.
Thank you for your being. Without you the world would not be the same!
Find inspiration inside yourself. Start by looking at yourself in the mirror. That will give you an idea of what you have inside yourself.
You owe it to yourself to have survived so long. Be thankful and proud of it. And survive further with grace, not fear.

They may be refusing to listen, but they are hearing it. Oh, yes. So don't worry and keep talkin'.
Hold your anti-hate feeling strongly inside you. That will communicate more than whatever you say to them, and affect them as well.
Nothing is out of our reach. We are just very clever and censor things we don't want to be involved in by saying they are out of our reach.
What is the greatest gift you could receive from anyone? Love with kindness.
What will be, will be.  And will give you a great lesson and great joy.  Don't be afraid.

Start taking your responsibility as one active piece of the grand configuration.
Concentrate on your energy &amp; how to use it. Those impressed with what they see will start wanting to be like you. Lecturing is not effective
I try to eat healthy food. And not eat so much at once. It seems to be a good way of eating when you're busy &amp; need a lot of time &amp; energy.
At school, I was about the same as now. Proud, intense, and caring of my classmates. So they always voted me to be the class monitor.
I believe in a higher power above me, within me &amp; around me, giving me protection, encouragement and inspiration.
Awaken your intelligence. Know that it is the best way to live together. And do it! People will follow your acts, not your lectures.
Nothing is avoidable. Just think that everything that is given to you is a challenge to make your stronger, wiser and more energetic.
Be patient. There is nothing you can't do. Don't think about it too much. It will come to you when you are not thinking intently about it.
Summer is for reading. Fall is for contemplation. Winter is cozy. Spring is another start.
It's hard not to think. I remember everything.
Do your best every day to clean up and give love.

Work gives you dignity and pride. You need those two in your life.
Keep making. Start by sending your work or photos or descriptions of your work to your friends. You'll be surprised how effective that is.
Have the courage and strength to be yourself. Because there is no other choice.  Do you have a choice of being somebody else?
We are here. And it is such a blessing - not just for us, but for the Universes.
Every human being wants and needs love. Love is the power that can change the world.

This planet will either become a Planet of War or a Planet of Peace. There's no two ways about it. So what do you want to believe in?
Love keeps us growing.

Happiness doesn't last. If it did, it will be called boredom. I would like my life to be a string of happiness punctuated by good work.
Ban the veil? Ridiculous. If it's to stop repression of women, start with banning spandex and very high heel shoes. They're health hazards.

Happiness is a warm heart
"Thank you", "I'm glad", "that was bad".  It keeps you moving and moving out of the terrible sadness.
If you do something awkward, just say "oh, that was bad." And move on.
If anything good happens in your life, even a small thing, just say "I'm glad."

I'm used to people trying to knock me down. I just tell myself that I should forgive them since they don't know what they are doing.
I got my nose back https://t.co/Rs5Rv5xwnW https://t.co/MNfpocPrM6
On a bad day, I immerse myself in work. If I am so depressed I can't do that, I just clean the rooms or the closets. It's very therapeutic.
Understanding yourself and forgiving and loving yourself as a result of it, will be a good step.
We all seem to waste so much time in life. But it's really not a waste at all. It's called 'giving yourself space.' We all need to do that.
Try to find yourself. That's a start.
You should feel good about yourself. If you don't, all the sweet words from others and good things you say about yourself won't help.
Saying "I love you" is a really powerful thing.  It creates a love reality. It circulates and is appreciated by the Universe.

We all have responsibilities as living things on this planet. Artists are living things, too.
Happiness is to know that it was just dropped on your lap, or to know that you created it yourself. Both are great happiness.
I believe in a godliness which is inside and also outside us, but which is not being controlled by one particular religion.
It's more fun to stay healthy and young. Be in love with your life and look after what we know to be 'one world one people'.
We are all on the same page, wanting to live in a peaceful world in the future. No advice. Just saying hi, and I love you!
Love of art, and art of love both live in my heart.
I love all trees. Don't you? What is there not to love about a tree?
For a show in Berlin, I wanted my band to be 4 plastic stands with tape recorders in each. John coined the phrase PLASTIC ONO BAND.

We are saving the world already, by thinking about doing it. And there are many of us. We are very lucky.
What did I enjoy most in school? Daydreaming.
What is the most important thing? To love yourself and the world. ...in that order.
What's the best way to feel free and relaxed in a busy world? Don't forget to dream.

I love the sound of the rain. Water from the sky that gives your skin a rest from the sun.
God is pure energy we draw from when we want to. So much human &amp; animal suffering is caused by religion. Religion is made by men.
We should have deep sympathy for all lives on earth. That includes men of our race, as well. But don't live a life you don't enjoy.
We are the trees, the ocean and the sky. That thought will probably make me smile. But no words are needed from either side.
"Yes" is needed when your life is a "no"
We are all passionate people trying to survive as well as we can before death hits us. Love yourself for it, and maybe others, too.
Make the world a better place by being your natural self - no lies, no hate, only love.
Is there more to life than this? This is life. No more no less.
What is love? It's what you know to be love.
Look at the nature around you. Is the inside of your head prettier than that?
What's my favourite possession? Me. That is, if I own this one.
Don't stick to rough times. Change the channel.
Don't try to be something. Just be yourself.
My heart starts beating faster when I see the sky.
Time is a very convenient concept. Sometimes we save ourselves and the situation by procrastinating.
You're still in my heart https://t.co/Nt22ZCtZg0 https://t.co/nvkwZvEM5w
Inspiration for visual art is usually something visual in my mind. Sounds in my head is music.

A shop closes and you come back again later. Everything in history has gone and come back. So why not the physical medium of music?

Love is all encompassing. It does not need anything to balance it.
I often try fasting. It's good for your health.
While you rearrange a room, you will get inspired with what to do next.
For women or men, the first step to help the world improve is to love oneself.
The universe has a soul. A beautiful one.
Meditation was a way of life in Asia. We as children were taught to include meditation in our lives from the start.
Your dream world and your real world. It's all you. Be thankful that you have two lives. It's more interesting than one.

I love winter. I was born in February, the morning when the whole world around the hospital was covered in snow.
Paint your nails the same colour as your heart
I don't eat a lot for breakfast. My stomach is still sleeping, so I just have tea or coffee.
Just be yourself. You help the world by being you, not by wearing a pair of high heeled shoes.
We should wish not to be given any awards, but to be needed by the world. An award is usually given to one who was useful - past tense.
Try not to be discouraged, moan or be angry. Know it's a difficult game, and play it with joy. One day you will have a surprise!
I quit smoking around 1990. Never went back. Now I only drink sparkling water, tea, and coffee.
I love playing piano pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin &amp; Debussy &amp; German lieder, Italian operatic arias &amp; French chansons to sing along to.
The greatest blessing from ageing is becoming wiser to life.
We are all angels standing together to create Heaven on Earth. And we will.
All peace movements work together on a very strong spiritual level. See it with your mind's eye. Know you are already part of it.

I love the guy who is pushing a stroller for 2 kids. We are all pushing our things slowly going to beyond where the sun is setting.
Keep mending, keep healing, keep creating goodness. That's what the world needs now.
Over 1,160,000 people have been killed by guns in the USA since @JohnLennon was shot and killed on December 8, 1980. https://t.co/q2s4MUs9Mo
Let's heal the world together.
Love can save the world. Keep changing negative energy into the positive energy using love.
I believe in pursuading without anger... like the song IMAGINE.  https://t.co/qQFlzsZ6s7
Is beauty tragic or comic? Neither, I think. Beauty is in a totally separate category from tragedy or comedy.

Become an oasis. Rejuvenate and revitalise. Heal the world.
I'm listening to the wind.
Equality should not be forced. Everybody desires something different. Just give people the freedom to be equal, if they want it.
It gives you energy to meet a challenge. It gives you wisdom to figure out the blessing. Discouragement is only a fertilizer for growth.
My life is full of discouragements. I think of everything that comes to me as a challenge and/or a blessing.
Express your love for whatever you love.
I cherish every little gift I receive now which has a scent of love in it, however faint.
Change our vision of war and the world will follow us.

Remember that war movies are not reality. People who have been to war all speak about how it is not exciting, but scary.
So we can still be conditioned to get excited by well-versed propaganda of war, and very well-made war films.

All peace starts with the knowledge of peace. One day, we will not have the word peace because the world will be so peaceful.
Let's not forget the grand beauty of this planet. It impresses me every day.
I think of women with pride and dignity. We are the hottest! And we will prove it by the miracles we create for the world.
Dance with Peace. If they see us having fun, they will want to try it themselves. Change your way of thinking and the world will follow you.

Alternative culture is always great!  It is the fire that lights the mainstream and keeps it alive.
I feel very good when it's a good day with a great blue sky.
Your greatest strength is believing in yourself.  Your greatest weakness is not believing in yourself.
Don't pursue acceptance from the world Concentrate on what you do as an artist Keep your pride and dignity as the giver creating the future
Believe in yourself. Stay healthy. Stay in love with your life. Every little thing you think and do is changing our Universe for the better.
The book about peace is in your heart. Listen to your heart, and you will know what to do.
The human race is an incredible race. We find new things about this Universe every day.
Peace is what each one of us creates. We have to be the ones to create it.
I am probably one of the last few people who believe in capitalism. But I do. Just give us women double your salaries and we'll shut up :)
Accept trust in your life and believe in it. Because the choice is either that or live in a mental hospital in your head.
Why am I fascinated by clouds? Because they are a transient existence.  No cloud can cloud us forever.
Tell your children that you love them. You can tell them with words, action, or thoughts.
All decisions are easy to make. All decisions are difficult to make. It depends on your outlook.
I have faith in all of us to bring world peace.
We all experience the feeling of our spirit rising with clear awareness and joy.... like when the Sun rises and lights up the Earth.
If love had a sound what would it be? Laughter.
I juggle work. I even read 3 books at a time. As a result, I have learnt to take care of things that are important, and not waste my time.
It's true what we said in the 60s. Everything is beautiful. If it is otherwise for you, it is only in your head that it is otherwise.
Every hour every minute, is magic for me.
Ask yourself why you are so angry at something that might be a blessing in disguise. It's such fun to find out that it actually was.
The grey tone is so beautiful! yoko https://t.co/3j2BdLjxMJ https://t.co/gP5I1fO0Cm
It's better for your health to stay peaceful as much as you can.
I try to be loving and peaceful, only because I know that it is such a drag to clean up after I splash anger!

Be creative during your normal day and make yourself proud of yourself.
I love the haddock and eggs breakfast in Liverpool. I never get a good one like that in London.
There was a long week in Karuizawa, when it never stopped raining. John made some beautiful collages during that time.
Stopping war will eliminate poverty, since war is being so costly to all of us participants.
Humour is like a sweet scent of a very fine flower. You want to breathe and let others breathe it, too. Life becomes easier then.
A name has its own definite sound, even when read silently.  So a name will influence you and your life as much as music does.
It's a hard world. But if you don't stay true to yourself, you will find that it is even harder.
Envious people can be very dangerous and harmful because they try to squeeze so much energy out of you. So stay away from them.
We are now standing in the heaven we have created together.  Sharing the joy with all lives on Earth. I love you! yoko
Give the skyline back to the sky. Give love to the earthline. Give love to Planet Earth rather than creating more high rises.
Start giving out your love ❤️
I'd like to see all the people living life in peace, as John said. I think we will. In fact, I know we will. So get ready!
When things go badly, I try to find out what the blessing might be - to make me feel better.
The greatest advice I've ever received was to not listen to any advice unless you can clearly see where it's coming from.
My favourite sounds in the world are all cooing sounds - of animals, people, green fields and winds...
All of us are young and sexy. We are eternally young in spirit, and eternally reaching with love to the outside world.
Advice to my 30 year old self?  Don't fret. It will be better than you imagine.
Reach out and give love. Share your warmth. You will find it immensely pleasing that you are creating and giving love where it is needed.
How to wake up intuition:  First trust in yourself.  If you don't, your intuition will be scared and go into a deep sleep.
I don't think about discardng ideas. I only think of learning more.
My favourite magical phrase? "Thank you, thank you, thank you, for a beautiful life."
We can feed the world by not thinking of food as the source of making more and more money with it.
It's nice to be different.

If others are misunderstanding or misinterpreting me, they are the ones who need to deal with themselves. Not me.
Life is a beautiful expansion of pointlessness. A point is not the point.
How many chances are there left for peace? As many as we need.
I am inspired by the wish to create revolution without violence.

"Ai" means love in Japanese.
I wish I could learn to speak in all languages. I might just be able to by 2100... Languages are beliefs.
Every colour, every number is lucky if you have love for it.
Be true to yourself. Life is as long as you make it. I want my sisters to remember that. Be patient with yourself and others.
Every day is beautiful to me. I pray and am thankful for every day for it's incredible magical beauty. Life is a miracle.
If you don't forgive, your health will be harmed. So, if anything, forgive for your sake.
Don't give credit to angry, crazy people who choose to stay in the unpleasant darkness of hate. Ignore them and stay in the light.
Karma exists, whether we believe in it or not.
One of my favourite songs is Sean's song called MAGIC. It's a painfully real song of the heart.

There's no criteria of laughter. You laugh because you need to laugh. It's good for your health, if you can.
Peace is not in a very distant future. It's right around the corner. Didn't you know?

Clean the water in your body, and become an oasis for the world. When all of us become an oasis, all the mess will be corrected and healed.
We have to spread peace. And we will. Start imagining a world without violence. Start seeing all of us smiling together.
Everything you think and do affects our society. So think peace. Start with that.
Everyone in the world can be an artist. We are all artists. Some of us notice it, and some of us don't.
The vibration of sound permeates our body and soul.
World Peace is definitely attainable. We are working on that now. You included.
I give thanks every day how wonderful it is to be still breathing. And you should, too.
The human race has survived all this time because we were peaceful enough.
Picasso and Braque brought a small alien element into art. It is for this reason that my heart beats for Cubism. https://t.co/mYY1lJvD7q
Silence is a sound.
Eat exactly what your body is asking for.
Problem? Start with feeling love for the problem. You will then know what step you wish to take.

The distinction between hate and love is all in your head. To make yourself ill, think of hate. To make yourself healthy, think of love.
Everywhere I go I fall in love with the place. Therefore, it is accurate to say that my favourite place so far is this planet.
Keep making music. Music is the power of healing. This planet needs a lot of healing. You will be healing the planet, as you make music.

Keep on making good music, my friends. Now the baton is in your hands.
Art. You create with love. It's simple as that.
What do you want to surround yourself with? I went for love.
Music will keep evolving at the speed we are evolving.
My favourite poem is one that relies on the truth it tells and not its form.
You are talented. Only, you may have been barking up the wrong tree. Once you know what you are talented in, you will feel much happier.

We are separate and together at the same time... like the cells in our bodies.
I don't watch TV so much anymore. It cuts into my reading time.
What has brought me the most joy over the years? Every day when the sky is blue.
Minimalism allows you to stick to essentials. It's a question of how you want to use your energy.
Don't get rid of negative emotion, but just use it... like the salt in your food.
Start dancing... physically or in your mind. Make sure to put on your favorite music for it. Keep dancing.

We are all beautiful, inside and out. See it clearly with your mind's eye.
When anything goes wrong, just know that in ten years, you will look back and laugh about it, if you have kept yourself healthy.
Marriage can have some serious ups and downs. But if you stay with it, it gets better with age. That's what John and I discovered.
What was the greatest gift I have ever got? True love. https://t.co/GKk2ueNQei

If you listen to some of my past records, the harsh ones were my signature sounds.

Excitement is always experienced but never recorded the same.
Any thought that fills you with fear is something you want to drop and come back to, looking at it from a different angle.
