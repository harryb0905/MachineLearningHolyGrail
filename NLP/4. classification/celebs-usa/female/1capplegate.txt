Sorry for my outburst. I'm just trying to deal with everything.  As a mom I just want a safe place for her. I'm sorry for my language.
So many typos because I was angry. Sorry to my husband who said " check your spelling and punctuation " as I was enraged
Don't you dare say that I don't get it. Because I am an actress I don't get it. That's fucked up
Don't you dare say that because I made a life for me and my single mother I don't undertand
Don't you dare say I don't understand the struggles. We lived on food stamps. Don't you dare say I don't know.
I grew up on an abusive home.  Now I make it public. Don't you dare say I don't understand.
I find it so offensive when people say those of us can't talk. You talk! You spew   So I'm exempt? Because I chose my work? What the fuck???
weird to me when you say I can't have a voice .I'm also a mother,a daughter and a human.i was birthed the same way you were

@livi_douglas I hope not!
Now I feel super sad and rejected. My charger for my phone says it doesn't support me. And it won't charge my phone. Crawling back under
This is a country of many voices. Some we may disagree with. But at the core we are humans with rights. We will not be silenced.

My friend is in that band. It's his job. How he supports his family
I just heard they r getting rid of the band on dancing with the stars. Bullshit! Why is this biz doing away with real musicians?

He is tannish brown with one white stripe down his back. With a glossy finish to his body? Anyone have an idea?if so tweet back with pic
We have a spider who has been living in our window for a long time. We named him Seymour but I need help identifying. See next tweet

It's a piece of paper you are fighting over. A piece of paper that allows two people rights to their own privacy to love who they love
The fact that this is still an issue. Is beyond me. The fact that its ever been an issue is ridiculous. Marriage equality for all humans!

The waitresses song I have to sing over parts I deem inappropriate. So she doesn't hear the part where they say "sucker"
Not to mention her favorite songs to dance to are anything bob marley and I know what boys like by the waitresses.

My funniest is someone said I looked like Christina applegate them said, "but she's fat and you're not" that happened
@spivey_e love you and miss you too

@GhostPanther when where and my I film it please???
@aaronembrytweet we think about you everyday
All I know is #demandaplan
When we see this happen we are so quick to blame because it makes it easier for us to understand. We will never understand this pain
What do we do about violent games. How do we stop this? I feel lost and helpless but ready to do whatever I can
I don't even know what  The conversation is anymore. What do we do for our kids with mental illness. What do we do about guns
#demandaplan as a mother as a woman as a human. I just can't shake this. Let's show the world how strong America can be when we gather
Thank you Lorne for that beautiful cold open of SNL.
I can't and won't shake the effect the shooting has. Something must be done. But for tonight I think of them
There are just no words. Only sorrow. We are all shedding tears today for those families.
I don't know about you, but the sadness I feel that Homeland is over after sunday till next season is ridiculous and well..sad

Mommy believed in Santa when she was a kid too. now she's cheating on daddy with a really old dude who was that old when she was born

@jessetyler @catdeeley I thought there may have been a medical condition involved. But I love ya anyway
@jessetyler @catdeeley My seat was oddly sweaty tonight. What the heck?
@carijeanie Also if I say that was so good, it means I didn't like it and I didn't want to be mean. Now I'm ok with being mean. Ha
@carijeanie I was nervous and they time our critiques. So sometimes when it comes to u you have 5 seconds to say something
@carijeanie I picked you out of the crowd. But seriously. I started dancing when I was 3 and was still in class till 2 yrs ago. Bam ha:)
@carijeanie sooooo why you talkin trash? Hahaha
Ugh I guess I got bleeped again on #sytycd. I didn't even cuss. I started to spell out the word shit. I'm a mom. It's how I say "shit"
@carijeanie Don't be mean
Thank you @dizzyfeet for having me back on #sytycd. I had a blast.
You are not exempt   It could happen to anyone. But you can drink and tweet. Because that's where the magic lies
Have a fun labor day weekend. But if you drink don't drive. Seriously don't be a douche. You could kill someone or yourself.
@TheLadyLiberal Wow.
@alvraen you don't have the luxury of negative thought. Best advice ever from reverend Michael Beckwith

@shakeshur That was song m By my mom written before I was born about a painting called Christina's world
http://t.co/aOZaBcsX
Now back to funny videos of chimps
And what I don't want our kids to feel is fear. I don't want my kid to feel she is any different than any other kid. That's why I got mad .
Childhood is the only time we are free, naive, innocent, unincumbered by the trials of life. Everything is in technicolor and is exciting
So I guess my rant sparked a conversation. An overdue conversation. So let me end this all with a couple of thoughts.
Now back to funny pics of cats
Just imagine for one second you having fun with ur kid in the park and a bunch of a holes start surrounding you and freaking ur kid out
Sorry everyone.  I'm pissed
Until they decided to be public. We need a law against this! Taking pics of kids is sick!
It's times like these where I understand why Michael Jackson had his kids covered  they were able to be anonymous
I want my daughter to live a normal life I want her to feel free to be who she wants, so paparazzi stop taking pics of her! Enough !
Hey Facebook moguls, I hate timeline. Make it go away.
last weeks sytycd! Brilliant. Wish I could've judged that night just to watch it unfold. Mia michaels makes me miss being a dancer. Sobbing
@JennifersWayJE @sarahjoybrown oh and Sadie's first cookie ever was yours. She kept saying wow over and over

First time I saw the Chili Peppers I was 18. And here I am 22 yrs later and they r still fucking amazing! Love u boys

@Dance9Chehon don't thank me! I thank you for fully immersing yourself in that gorgeous piece. Congrats!
Listening to Elvis Costello " I want you"  such an amazing song... That's all
One last SYTYCD comment.im sad to see those dancers go. I thought they were brilliant last night. But it's you're votes.
Congrats to @maclaineshirley on your @dizzyfeet honor. You are my inspiration, my hero, and may I say friend. I adore you!
@adammshankman, so excited 2 c #stepuprevolution this weekend. Always inspiring! #bestdancing evr!
@Mandy_Sherman Loved seeing you sweet girl. Wish we could've hung out more...
a dancer my whole life, and having to stop 2 years ago, I miss it dearly. But those kids on SYTYCD inspire me, and I live thru them
Sooo, I got bleeped for saying "thank you jesus". Weird
Just finished judging SYTYCD. So fun! Watch at 8 on FOX. My old home
When was the last time u watched "little darlings" ? Damn, I love that movie.  That's all
Damn autocorrect!
Thank you directv and viacom for working it out. I am now in bed watching my favorite show that I missed!
I think for #SYTYCD I'm going to go with the phrase " You're Flyn nice turnout!" Tune in tomorrow at 8pm
@KathyShawver Kathy!!!!!!
I need to come up with a catch phrase for SYTYCD like Mary with "hot tamale train". Any suggestions? Haha
@tish919 Brad thank u for what u do. Be safe, be strong, and get home soon!
I am guest judging on #soyouthinkyoucandance 2morrow at 8pm on FOX. Watch me use fancy dance terms trying to sound cool! Oh wait, I am! Haha

Thank you Peggy Sirota for a lovely shoot today. You made me feel very safe and not many photographers do that! And I love your new shoes!
@davepaul22 It's me
And my last statement is that in the UK they blur out the faces of children in magazines. Why can't we have the same respect here?
Let children be children! If they choose to pursue a public career later in life that's their choice! But don't rob them of their anonymity!
Look I understand that the shitty side effect of what I do is paparazzi. But leave my kid out of it. Children should be off limits.
Since when did this site become yet another tabloid? I have to unfollow
I wish that the news site I follow would stop posting paparazzi pics of celebs and their kids! It fuels the fire! U know who u are!!
If u disagree with me that's ok. And it's ok 4 me to disagree with u http://t.co/5mZcw9e0
Dave Gahan Joins Soulsavers for L.A. Show http://t.co/0VN6lFbV via @rollingstone I was there, it was wonderful! And my honey played bass!
