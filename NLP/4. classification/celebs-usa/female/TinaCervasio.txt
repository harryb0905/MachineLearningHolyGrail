@DMStoneNY It's a lot for some fans. I have fans in our newsroom devastated. One grown man was screaming about Zucc the other day.  I don't care if it's one fan favorite or all 8 guys you want out,  It's hard to be a fan today.
#NYR just dumping guys left and right today. Hayes, now McQuaid to Blue Jackets.  I'm still upset after watchin that Lundqvist post game moment over Zucc yesterday... #Sports
Now please watch #SportsXtra on @fox5ny.
#Knicks win. Minutes later, #SpikeLee wins. It’s a good night for #NewYork. #NBA #oscars. Ok ... Spike’s win is bigger. But the synergy is pretty awesome. #BlacKkKlansman #DoTheRightThing
If you’re a #NewYork sports fan, it’ll be easy for you to turn to @fox5ny at 10:30pm for #SportsXtra because I have BOTH @FlavaFraz21 &amp; Pete Alonso taking about the competition at #Mets 1B. While @DBetances68 talks about big additions to both his family &amp; #Yankees bullpen! https://t.co/fPBbTSizZf
@NYG_27 But I want to know winners, the ending of True Detective and have to work! gahhhhh lol
The #Oscars are on, #TrueDetective is on, I'm at work writing @fox5ny #SportsXtra, and will be on air in less than an hour.  Stressful night. lol
This is real. "Sports is a business ... blah blah".  Sports also involves humans ... these guys are people, with friends, and lives.  #NYR https://t.co/vk6WkisPM2
Ugh. Bodies down all over the ice. Really tough OT loss for #Rangers after fun game to watch them come back.
Back in NYC &amp; back in @fox5ny #sportsnook &amp; haven't got a stitch of writing done for tonight's #SportsXtra cuz I'm watching this WILD @NYRangers game! Skjei treating us to some FREE hockey! Coming off the Zucc trade ... these #Blueshirts play so hard for their rebuild situation.
Happy Birthday @ShaunFromFoleys !!!!! Hope you'll get to enjoy some warm, spring training games soon! https://t.co/QAI4HPqZPO
@Dan_Shaughnessy Between losing John Martin end of the season and now,Nick. I’m so sad. But can’t imagine what the shock &amp; sadness is like for you guys who are there and were w Nick every. Day. Fort Myers and Boston coverage will never be the same. 😢🙏🏼
@RochieWBZ That is so him. 😢🙏🏼
@Ben_ESPN I know you know this, Ben, your Dad was THE nicest man. He helped me out a lot when I first got to NESN &amp; was adjusting to Boston. Helped me w a Cora story the morning after the Sox WS!. Praying for you, your mother and sister’s strength during this time. His legacy lives on.
@BuckinBoston So sorry, Steve. I’m still in shock, hearing the news while in Tampa.
So saddened. I loved talking to Nick about #RedSox &amp; baseball. Enjoyed interviewing him on @NESN pregame shows back in ‘06 &amp; ‘07. We kept in touch. Shared info about Yanks &amp; Sox. Always looked fwd to seeing Nick in Bronx. Helped me w/Alex Cora Story in Oct. 🙏🏼 To Cafardo Family. https://t.co/HzYTD1AmPC
Boone starting to list players who will play in Fort Myers Vs BOS for 1st #SpringTraining game Saturday. Hicks, Torres, Andujar, Bird ... to start there. #Yankees
Boone intimated Miguel Andujar &amp; Gleyber Torres ... did not enjoy taking live BP against Adam Ottavino.  😆 But Boone said it was “fun ... great” watching him pitch today. ⚾️#righty #fastballs #stuff #Yankees #SpringTraining
#Yankees Aaron Boone says having Brett Gardner back brings leadership “he’s an important voice in our room ...sets tone of our culture. I think it’s important to remember this is still a very productive player, LF in our ballpark u need an elite defender out there. He does that.”
@Yankeevoice Frazier’s swing has a lot of moving parts. Will be interesting to see how this pans out during spring training.
Of course, when I’m rolling not much happens. But two things. Stanton (wait for it) his stance is a tad longer than last year. Then next round he crushed 2 homers over LF pavilion. &amp; over @GMSField sign in LCF. Cleared both by a mile. Judge was laughing. #Yankees #SpringTraining https://t.co/es6rDAJzRS
#Yankees Brett Gardner getting work in during BP today. Talking to media earlier this AM saying he wouldnt want to play anywhere else, wanted to be a part of CC’s last year &amp; expects to continue playing beyond this year. #SpringTraining https://t.co/ujOfqx00VX
@KimJonesSports @TODAYshow OMG Kim! I’m setting my alarm!
@BruceBeck4NY @NBCNewYork Wait! So, Jimmy started covering Spring Training with you when he was 10 years old??
Coming up on @fox5ny News at 10: Today was the 2019 #Yankees first full squad workout. What they got was a healthy Aaron Judge, restacked bullpen &amp; competition at 3 field positions. Oh yeah ... &amp; #Championship expectations. Hear from @TheJudge44 @DBetances68 @clintfrazier &amp; more! https://t.co/INJsBMgVKk
So proud of my #Boston Bestie @JessicaCamerato as she returns to #Boston! For any #RedSox fans that still follow me ... give Jess a follow. She has a talent to get players to say things they’ve never talked about before. The best story teller. https://t.co/yiy2P1sp0Q

What did @TheJudge44 learn last season? “Not to get hit in the wrist. Turn the other way!” #Yankees https://t.co/5pqNEDMsAA
“The goal? We fell a little short last season. You always want to be the last one standing.... that’s our goal again this year.” ~Aaron Judge. #Yankees #AllRise @fox5ny https://t.co/htRPOWZy6x
#Yankees Aaron Judge says he’s completely healthy from wrist and it’s makes all the difference starting spring 100% compared to last year (shoulder) because he can work on things to improve, tinker with swing, and now “it gets fun!” @fox5ny https://t.co/OTA3WZkFOK
“We think we have the people, the players .... to make a championship run ...” ~Aaron Boone #Yankees https://t.co/9oWZOFhPvq

@NeyenhouseTV Hi Chris, Same here! So good to meet other people in our FOX affiliate family! Please thank everyone at @FOX13News for their hospitality and great work.
#Yankees Giancarlo Stanton said it did take time...having to face &amp; see different AL pitchers to really get grip on their tendencies, release points &amp; pitches, BUT biggest difference last season was playing in meaningful games after May 7th. “I never had that before” @fox5ny https://t.co/G7qfT5YkEq
#Yankees Giancarlo Stanton said his hamstring was a big factor last season but he always wanted to be out there to try to help team. Said it did feel completely healthy by end of season. #SpringTraining2019 @fox5ny #fox5nysports https://t.co/xof514OhWy
@InesRosales I’ll bring the sun (and humidity) back for ya!!
More from @DBetances68 on his own contract extension talks ... his agent Jim Murray has engaged in talks with Cashman but Dellin says he’s staying out of it and focusing on winning a World Series Champ. “I just want to win” but “1st diaper change didn’t go too well” #Yankees
More from @DBetances68 ... he’s good fri nds with #Machado &amp; has kept up with him. Can’t believe he’s not signed yet ... someone said “here?” ... Dellin laughed and said “he’ll sign somewhere soon.” #Yankees #SpringTraining
But says he’ll be able to catch up. #Betances #SpringTraining
#Yankees New dad @DBetances68 confirms his baby boy is not “junior” he’s Dellin J. Betances or “D.J.”  Mom &amp; 7pounder are doing great. Dellin says he’s a righty &amp;already has his wrist bent for breaking balls! Dad has Only thrown 2Xs last 5 days. Haven’t thrown a bullpen in while,

The fans I interviewed at the #Mets #SpringTraining complex after Tebow came through when he finished his on field work, were practically crying after meeting him and talking about how he has inspired them to work hard, go for their dreams and be nicer people. https://t.co/tDogOonAdB
@TBone8 @TimTebow His press conference was so inspirational. See if you can get it off @SNYtv online. Make your son watch!
Tebow sees @TheAAF as good for football &amp; fans &amp; believes players can absolutely move up to #NFL from there and yes, Coach Spurrier called a lot, but “it wasn’t very hard” to say no. Says he’s “all in for baseball”. #TebowTime #Mets
Tim Tebow says “this will be the biggest Spring Training for me ... two years ago I had no idea what I was doing....” last year he broke ankle first day (&amp; even used term “never got a snap... (major laughs) meaning “at bat”) ... #Mets #TebowTime https://t.co/2im4wIdIpK

Tonight on @fox5ny News at 5 (5:50pm to be exact). My #Mets #SpringTraining report. https://t.co/32Qz3FCPoE
@atTheTrack7 agreed. But hey. When ya can’t run, ya bulk up.
@atTheTrack7 You can’t even see him in there! But if you’re talking about my other video: ummmm he can’t run! So very limited cardio. He’s lifting. Throwing. Limited hitting. Callaway even said “I went to shake Yo’s &amp; he almost broke it.” So he clearly has bulked up.  Nothing else to do.
And here’s Cespedes leaving the clubhouse. All smiles. Right after signing some autographs for kids. You can tell he just wants to play baseball. He’s getting paid for it! And my camera was locked. So... turn your phone. 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/4ZKaAacS4e
More from #Cespedes: “It’s been frustrating because I loves baseball” (through translator) and he’s been out of the game for a few months now. He wants to be with the team. He’s bored. But the only thing he can do is try to get back on field to help team later this year. #Mets
#Cespedes says this #Mets team is great &amp; there are many young players that are going to help the team win... in his case he will continue to work to get stronger. There is no real timeline. No idea when he’ll be cleared to run. #Mets #SpringTraining2019
#Mets Yoenis Cespedes is in there. Saying he’s been here at complex working out for 2 months. Says when he does return expects to be like 2015, he feels the rest of his body (not heels) are strong healthy. Said there Wasserman point he was struggling to walk. https://t.co/MNPOKX6F7V
He’s back. And loving being a #Mets player again. Role is different in 2019, but Jeurys Família is embracing new closer Edwin Diaz &amp; has a bold prediction for this season! Hear from him TONIGHT on @fox5ny News at 5! #fox5ny #fox5nysports #SpringTraining https://t.co/e17DogSl61

@CPIZZAIA Boone did say they can also use strong pitchers within the organization that could spot start like Luis Cessa, Domingo Herman, etc. But I do agree. Trade deadline for a strong starter could be key ... like Happ last year.
Who got to see or hear #Yankees @AaronBoone's first press conference of 2019 #SpringTraining?  What are your take aways? Is your impression, that this team is better than 2018 who won 100 games? Can this team get to World Series? Thoughts on rotation? CC making it official?
Snow ❄️ outside, But summer☀️ on my mind. 48 hours til I arrive at spring training &amp; today spent day around Tennis. 5:50PM on @fox5ny there’s more to @NewYorkOpen then great @ATP_Tour tennis.

@KnicksKnowDrama 24 hours ago Knicks did not have cap space for two, star, Max Contract Players. Now they do. And it’s not about trade deadline. It’s about his free agency. With Room on Knicks now for him &amp; KD or Davis ... however things go.
@WorldWideWob Everyone needs to break out the signs. (Like during Ali sanity) Go all in.  Nothing to loose. #KnicksCapSpace and ... 👋🏼 Wob 👊🏼
Think about it ... wondering if he would have given this answer at 10 AM Thursday before news of Porzingis’ meeting surfaced? Hmmm 🤔 #KnicksCapSpace #JerseyBoy https://t.co/I1qPREVQZZ
#Knicks make it official. Scott Perry: “Considering the uncertainty regarding Kristaps’ free agent status &amp; his request today to be traded, we made a trade that we are confident improves the franchise. We thank Kristaps, Tim, Courtney and Trey for their contributions... @FOX5DESK
@faustolozada One word: Zion
@EBBistro But who's the light now?
Oy vey. https://t.co/h9ngm6767q
@bobmorehouseNY He did go to brass in private. Someone from inside leaked it to reporter ... or, someone on Dallas side leaked it when they were reached about trade talks. It's how this works.
@nickinthesouth But .... it's not who they are "looking for" ... it's "who will come to New York". Not a given these days.
So true. It's VERY hard on players who get to this level in the #NBA ...because they are: competitive. Talked to someone close to a #Knicks player this week. It's confusing, depressing, frustrating how it will impact their future &amp; development as a player, when you keep losing. https://t.co/DDSyalvCu6
@nyjetsgirl25 Just disappointing we will never get to see him play healthy, surrounded by another top pick, Knox and a new max free agent. #whatcouldhavebeen #again
Just finished putting together another outside the box in-depth report from #SuperBowl &amp; now... #Porzingis happens. So let’s change gears.... #Knicks fans, ur thoughts on Porzingis going to brass “concerned” about future of team &amp; now he could be on his way to Dallas? #talktome

Marveling all AM on @fox5ny #GDNY on the dominance, stats &amp; grace of #HOF2019 Mariano Rivera w his #Unanimous Vote &amp; the remarkable class Including #Yankees teammate Mike Mussina, the one hitter who was consistently successful vs Mo, Edgar Martinez &amp; the late Roy “Doc” Halladay. https://t.co/mwOvL9U8lR
@Ruknighttime Two years. NESN team reporter. I have a World Series Ring from 2007 with my name on it and I’m very proud. When you become a sports broadcaster. you are a fan of sports. The games. The stories. Not the teams.
#Yankees GM Brian Cashman on #MarianoRivera’s unanimous #HallOfFame election: “...no matter how big a star he became, he never failed to carry himself w/unerring professionalism and class. Mo was always someone who I could point to and say, ‘That’s what a Yankee should be like.’”
Love some of these statements being released by the #Yankees on Mike Mussina. #HallofFame https://t.co/EoQU2J2U6G
Confirmed on @MLBNetwork .... #Yankees Mariano Rivera gets 100% of the votes. #Unanimous #FirstEver #HallOfFame perfection! So deserved.
Moooooooooo! The cutter. ⚾️ The saves. The winning. The smile. The faith. 🙏🏼 Congratulations #MarianoRivera!

It's Eli's B-Day, he can barge into Gettleman's office if he wants to!🤣 Sports this AM @fox5ny #GDNY. Where's the angle maybe Eli was upset w/Oline Gettleman had out there 1st 8games, or 1st half of season play calls &amp;was brutally honest about THAT? #thinkingoutloud Ur Thoughts?
@CompMazzaRadio He is not responsible for 2017. Not one ounce. He did mention that locker room culture was a mess when he came in. That had to be priority. They got that in order this year. Shows you how bad the situation was under McAdoo. Said he will continue to fix this.
Gettleman answering on Pat Shurmur's support of Eli, "it's part of it. ...I'm a big believer in collaberation... these are conversations you gotta have." Wants to hear what coaches, scouts have to say. Back to Eli conversation: "We had a great conversation ... he's a #mench!"
#Giants GM Dave Gettleman ..."There's nobody in this room that can argue w me on this, this team did not quit. It was competitive as hell &amp; that's a start." (on giving up most pts in division: "We gotta improve this defense." Will not answer QB ques. Says has to meet w coaches.
This quote ... coming after he said Eli came at him hard and strong and "won" in the long run.
#Giants GM Dave Gettleman on he &amp; Eli's "honest &amp; upfront" convo Mon:"We will do what's in the best interest of the NY football Giants...what we're trying to do here is build sustained success...takes brutal honesty &amp;hard decisions...don't ask me about contracts, negotiations..."
@madipuppy17 @fox5ny Did I say he was the answer? No. Backup. Creates depth with experience. Yes. That is what he brings.

#Giants Odell did not stretch and warm up with team. At practice with helmet on. Got on bike for a bit. Now doing individual leg work with bands on Sidline. https://t.co/rjL7IZ4k1h
#Giants today: Pat Shurmur says there’s a Chance Odell &amp; Ogletree could play against Cowboys, they are better than they were. But ... Ogletree will not practice today. Odell will continue to warm up, but isn’t expected to do much else.
@Globe_Tara This is amazing. He does look like him! love the way he holds the snowman for picture.
@jason_balsan @kevinmckearney Merry Christmas, to you and your family Jason!
@madipuppy17 @kevinmckearney You are a watcher!!! Thank you.

Merry Day after #Christmas from @fox5ny #GDNY. I have an #NBA late games recap, LeBron inj update, the #LegLamp &amp; how the #Knicks actually did win big yesterday BEFORE tip-off. Then in the 8 AM hour, in the spirit of the holidays, a #NewYork Sports family #fox5nysports feature.
@SurvivinAmerica @kevinmckearney Merry Christmas, Annie &amp; many blessings to you in the New Year! Miss you in NYC. Best wishes to Eli!
@CangyManMSG Beautiful Steve! Merry Christmas.
Have Faith ✝️... &amp; a Very Merry Christmas 🎄 from @kevinmckearney and Me 🖤.  ~ “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”Isaiah 9:6 https://t.co/MVnpL2uJWK
@DeaconMarty1 @fox5ny Merry Christmas 🙏🏼
Hope ur enjoying my tour of the #NewYork Sports Teams on our @fox5ny “Santa’s Sports Sleigh” this AM on #GDNY. Our athletes do more than dribble, catch, tackle,skate, hit etc. And we can’t measure the impact they’ve had on the people they helped or visited this #Christmas Season. https://t.co/vtOQu8PEOD
Lots of #Christmas Red &amp; Green on fox5ny #GDNY set today w/ @loristokes &amp; @sukanyanyc ... making this #christmaseve morning, Merry! 🎄 @ FOX 5 / https://t.co/nvBTpJ6wJ0 https://t.co/2zpWByL3GI
Love this beautiful @KelvinBeachumJr family picture on our @fox5ny #SportsXtra set! Merry Christmas to your family Kelvin, and thank you for all you do in the community to help others. #Jets #fox5nysports https://t.co/gFh1m4V4M0
@Broomblossem Oy, I was being sarcastic. The purpose was to brag about my fantasy team winning championship ... ironically ... with Giants players.
@Jskorn @fox5ny and both their defenses screwed them late in both games.
@AnitaMarks ... DID YOU SEE THIS!!!!!!!!!! I WON!!!!!!!!!!! After alllll these years!!!!!
@T_Henn21 @nyjets Merry Christmas!
@T_Henn21 @nyjets I just think, with Meyer finally gone at Ohio State, he could run the Big Ten next year. Be the big dog. That's what he loves. I know the offer will be huge, Miami will be after him too. I'm still kinda leaning towards what Mike McCarthy could do here.
Hate to say it, but Strong performances by Both Manning &amp; Darnold still end in narrative of #Giants &amp; #Jets seasons w/losses. LOTS of Hockey! And next hour ... jump on our @fox5ny #SantaSleigh to tour our local teams as they bring #Holiday Cheer &amp; spread #Christmas spirit. #GDNY
The NY Giants had an off year, but Ladies &amp; Gentlemen MY "Futbol Giants" just won the #FantasyFootballChampionship for the 1st time in this owner's history of #FantasyFootball. 🏆🏆I had both Eli &amp; @Saquon. But @deshaunwatson was my #1. Team logo: @obj taking a PK. #perfect #iwon https://t.co/9ftmTXin8I
@junebug3378 Thank you Kenneth. Merry Christmas.
@chasedog18 @fox5ny @JenXperience @MLStadium @BrandonSteiner Thank you for watching!
#Jets &amp; #Giants blow leads. What are players saying? 10:30 @fox5ny #SportsXtra has it covered. @JenXperience reports from @MLStadium. #Nets, #NHL games &amp; we go on a tour w local teams bringing Holiday Cheer to others this #Christmas. Plus ... @BrandonSteiner in his new book. https://t.co/XjHgBq9gjI
@brian7551 @steinersports Sweet!
@ByKimberleyA 🤣😂 #Truth
What started out as a segment to get the best New York sports memorabilia gifts still available at both steinerstoreny &amp; @steinersports (open tomorrow), turns into an amazing conversation… https://t.co/LzK6KtR6UD
For the record my "Futbol Giants" are currently in my Family League's #FantasyFootballChampionship. I made a very poor decision not playing #Jets Robbie Anderson, but #Texans Deshaun Watson may have bailed me out. Let's go #Steelers JuJu! (not a #ppr league). #nowbacktowork
@brian7551 One more game to go.
I think we can all agree Sam Darnold has played increasingly better each week since returning from injury. Those few games he took-in from sidelines appears to have been a blessing in disguise for this young QB, ... so important to future of #JETS
AND they put up 70 pts in a Bowl Game. @ArmyWP_Football sets goals each preseason camp. Now, 1?more goal to go. After finishing with “Best record ever” with 11th win, “#BEATNavy”, “Win Bowl Game” ... “Play for Brotherhood” “Retain #CIC Trophy’s”... last goal: “FINISH in top 25.” https://t.co/ibpZulmWQ4
@LauraOkmin @JulieDiCaro You are both amazing at what you do and who you are as people. Thank you for encouraging and standing up for others while still kicking butt &amp; taking names in this sports industry. Your inspiring tweets have often lit a fire in me to never worry and just, be me!
I’m a little late to the party ... posting my fox5ny Holiday Party pics. 🎄🎈🍾Great time with amazing people. Thanks to those who text me pics. Next time I’ll have my phone fully charged.… https://t.co/yV6PHAIv24
Magical night! #fox5ny https://t.co/wxUyUCAApK
@Michael_Buffer @TheGarden @YouTube @DAZN_USA @MatchroomBoxing @EddieHearn Can’t thank you enough for your time and for sharing your incredible stories. 🙏🏼🎤🥊
Even though I was working, I really enjoyed my time at @harlemgrown Holiday Celebration where #Jets @quincyenunwa handed out toys to each kid following his @usmarinecorps #toysfortots… https://t.co/5oobnAQWcQ
#NYR @MikaZibanejad @fox5ny #SportsXtra:"We've been talking about the rebuilding...but I think in the locker room u kinda want to...get that word out of the way...it's almost an excuse for losing...For (young) guys the best way to get into it, is winning" https://t.co/QPInXTAjHM
@GameOfThrones @jimmykimmel @KChenoweth @TPAIN @AaronRodgers12 @HBO And @NotoriousOHM and @NYPost_Lewis and @TinaCervasio ...
@JCaporoso Yes. That equals Six. lol  And if that is sarcasm I'm sensing ... I'm letting my friend @jayfeely handle it from here. 😉
Oh yeah .... 6 Pro Bowlers out of New York despite no post season. 🏈 #GiantsPride #Jets
🏀🏒🏈⚾️ LOTS to cover this December AM in #NewYork #sports on @fox5ny #GDNY. #Nets beat 4th In West #Lakers for SIXTH STRAIGHT WIN. Every local hockey team in action. I may break out the #Devils Jersey. Ramos is a #Mets catcher. Machado gets wined🍷&amp;dined🍽 today by #Yankees
And now back to Jarrett Allen blocking LeBron ...  #Lakers #Nets
Tonight on the @fox5ny News at 10, #Jets WR @QuincyEnunwa takes the toys he collected via @ToysForTots_USA &amp; personally hands them out to kids from @HarlemGrown. A great #Christmas story where I also found adorable kids asking questions about Sam Darnold. #fox5nysports https://t.co/DdIG1ESNRc
No Odell on Pro Bowl roster. But look at the year these WRs had: Julio Jones, Adam Thielen, Mike Thomas, Davante Adams. #Giants Landon Collins makes his THIRD STRAIGHT #NFL #ProBowl. So unfortunate he sustained that shoulder injury.
Such a bright light during a down year. #GiantsPride https://t.co/cKi5VK46FG
There he is. A #Giants rookie making the Pro Bowl. First Giants RB to even be in Pro Bowl since Tiki Barber. https://t.co/ctCuOEmdRf
@StephanieReady @ripcityhamilton @NBA @NBAonTNT Congratulations Stephanie!!!! Can’t wait to have you on an NBA Radio Show again soon. 🏀🍾🎈
@Ian_OConnor @Jason get your money ready! Have you ever had a unicorn 🦄 ... with a 🦄(Porzingis) working for that 🦄? Maybe this would be a first! hehe (read Ian's article ... if you haven't already 🙂 )
@Mountaingal456 @fox5ny @Rangers I shoulda asked Mika!
@edogs2002 @fox5ny hahahahaha Good eye!  I think I gotta keep that one.  lol
@SchwartzSports @fox5ny Or use it as alternate each year.
@mcrf94 @fox5ny Did you NOT watch Sports Xtra on Sunday night where I had your #1Center &amp; Rangers' team leader in points ON my set, talking about his season, new coach, growing out of rebuilding &amp;learning how to win!? I cover ALL teams. Had major Mika coverage 8 hours before this came in mail!😂
@Genosworld @fox5ny Hi Geno!
@robbagels @fox5ny The Devil does hang out in fire.  Makes sense.
@bocaraton123456 @DevilsInsiders @fox5ny sweet
@Patriot1971 @fox5ny And I just had Mika in studio Sunday night ... so I'm well balanced as the NY reporter. lol
@nyrs_rangers @fox5ny lol yup
@stevenwoj @DevilsInsiders @fox5ny Honestly it's being passed around between 7 people as we speak. As the sportscaster, I've got to keep it neutral, had Rangers' Zibanjad in studio just last night. But it's my job to report to fan base what team's doing on&amp; off ice. TV is visual, so it's cool to see the item.
Tweet and you shall receive!!!  Not even a set up. This really just arrived at @fox5ny ... after tweeting about #NJDevils heritage jerseys, I couldn’t resist. https://t.co/uo1HGiBP0G
Looks like these are on sale now! Sweet #NJDevils Heritage jerseys.  And appropriate for this time of year bringing back that green!! @NJDevils will actually were them @PruCenter versus Blue Jackets next Sunday the 23rd. https://t.co/IqRBxN2njV

Don’t be fooled by the sign 🤣😂 @nyrangers @MikaZibanejad joins me on fox5ny #SportsXtra tonight. So gracious of him to stop by after tough OT loss to Vegas at Garden today. You won’t want… https://t.co/p4hJenU3Vh
@SWHTown30 He's figured it out and really listening to Atkinson.  This is a good locker room too.  Guys like each other and have figured out how to win. His talent is really coming through every game now.
Tonight is the #JohnSterling @BrooklynNets game from Barclays.  Dying to hear a "That's basketball Sarah!" To @sarahkustok.   In my interview with John &amp; Suzyn this summer, he talked so fondly of his days calling basketball, living in Atlanta and his @ATLHawks announcer days.
@jason_balsan @fox5ny @russsalzberg @giantswfan @WestPoint_USMA @USNavy @ArmyNavyGame @CBSSports Hi Jason! Wasn't the Army / Navy game great! Even better with an Army win. Of course, I remember meeting you at West Point.  Thanks for always watching my shows and reports! Hope to see you soon!
Happiness is, when your @fox5ny #SportXtra guest scores goal.  Still need a few more here to get a win at home! Stay tuned tonight ... #NYR @MikaZibanejad joins me in studio! #NHL #Sweden #LGR
Later today... Check out #GiantsKickoff 5pm on @fox5ny with @russsalzberg &amp; me bringing you a preview as #BigBlue takes on the #Titans looking to keep that slim #NFC #WildCard hope alive. @giantswfan tries to cover my one-handed TD catch since I’ll be filling in for OBJ! #Giants https://t.co/dtVgKoXnnl
Sign of the times! The @NJDevils will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 5:30 tonight for new, 1,200-square-foot @WilliamHillUS sports lounge at @PruCenter. Putting it right to use as Devils host the Vegas Golden Knights tonight.
#Nets @SDinwiddie_25 confirms extention w/ @BrooklynNets w/ tweet &amp; on IG. Reportedly a 3-year extension at $34m. Deserved. Fought back from injury &amp; doubters. Loved telling story about his #K8IROS brand &amp; @k_obrand painted sneakers for charity.  https://t.co/fRMyeqGmwp #WeGoHard
@kevincanessa No. They are not. I do not know them. There are a lot of Cervasio’s in NY &amp; NJ.
Attended my 1st Title Fight Press Conf for #CaneloRocky at @TheGarden. I’ve always loved Boxing. Been to a few amateur &amp; lower cards live. The training &amp; discipline blows me away. Today’s theatrics: awesome! Plus I chatted w @Michael_Buffer! I’ll bring u his story Sunday. @fox5ny https://t.co/JDeHIqHupP
@giantswfan ... see link. 🤣😂
#Giants @obj_3 was limited in practice Wed. w/same quad injury that kept him out of WAS game. I practiced in full &amp; picked up the one handed touchdown catches. Look at Paul Dottino ...… https://t.co/HenoPGaQyB
Cashman always said Happ “checked all the boxes” that’s why this morning is was interesting to hear Happ was leaning towards Philly. Different offer must have changed things a bit. https://t.co/2vSW8mQCyh
Pat Shurmur has not spoken with Landon Collins since his shoulder surgery yesterday. But said the feedback was .... everything was successful. #Giants
#Giants Odell Beckham Jr will not participate in practice today. He did the walk through, but will not Practice due to quad inj. Pat Shurmur said he’s getting better each day. But nothing definitive yet for Titans game. @fox5ny @FOX5DESK

Talking about Washington’s QB injuries. And Pat Shurmur’s experiences w/ McNabb &amp; Bridgewater and getting to 3 QB’s on 2 different teams. In end, when asked about Eli Manning. Knocks on wood. #giants
#Giants Coach Pat Shurmur just announced Landon Collins may need shoulder surgery. He’s still getting evaluated &amp; going through that process. So it’s not 100% definite. But ... doesn’t look good. #injuries #nfl
@benholdenpxp @JenXperience @WISENYC Thanks, Ben!
@GlennCrooks @JenXperience @WISENYC Thanks, Glenn.
#HotStove Heating up in NYC. Talking about it this AM on @fox5ny #GDNY w/ @rosannascotto &amp; @loristokes. If u WATCH us ea AM, U would NOT be surprised by Corbin singing w/Nats, cuz Brian Cashman told me some stuff on air last week. Plus, #Mets GM BVW has more moves up his sleeve!

@benholdenpxp Now, rappel down it!!!
Tonight on @fox5ny #SportsXtra #Giants pull off OT win! Hear from OBJ &amp; Saquon on how their big plays were offensive game changers. #Jets collapse late. @AnitaMarks stops by to dish on if Darnold should play &amp; HC candidates. Plus @DaveMaloneyMSG on #Rangers youth movement. https://t.co/PZg1Bxg21R
WOW! 🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/vfH825Sdra
#Jets @QuincyEnunwa has a couple catches so far today. Last week he joined me on @fox5ny #SportsXtra telling me about his high expectations the rest of season, coming back from neck surgery &amp; his plans for this Monday's #ToysForTots Event @TheMeadowlands https://t.co/z4aztaV5Xf
Keep in mind he still can’t buy a drink, and missed his prom for the #NYDerby 2 years ago. https://t.co/KggqB41rJp
@FindingExcuses Or ... Army.
@art_stapleton The Clone Wars. @NotoriousOHM @NYPost_Lewis
Okay. So. Here’s a thought.  Start OBJ under Center.  2019 QB.  #justsaying #guyistalented #GiantsPride
Talked about it with @giantswfan all day long on @fox5ny #GiantsKickoff yesterday ... in order for the #Giants to even have a chance to win, they have to win the turnover battle. Alec Ogletree is doing everything he can to do just that. 2nd INT, and a leaping, impressive one!
Best of luck to this one ... what a special, talented young (very young) man, with an amazing story, and even more of an amazing future ahead in Germany.  #RBNY #farewell #hardtokeepagoodguyhome https://t.co/rN3fjyDp34

Wally Backman ... is back! #Mets #LIDucks https://t.co/kRrPN0H8UT
Caught up with #JoeNamath at @MarchofDimes annual sports luncheon, where he was given the Sports Legend Award. Asked him what #Jets should do with Sam Darnold moving forward, “Once he’s healthy, let him play ... he wants to play, he wants to work, he NEEDS to work to improve.” https://t.co/PHobYc93tW
Thank you to @FollowHSRacing @GSteinbrennerIV @PatricioOWard @ColtonHerta for visiting @fox5ny today! Can’t wait to bring your story to #fox5nysports about this young, hard working team! And good luck in your rookie @IndyCar season in 2019! https://t.co/hjZkodV7VY
Talking about THREE different quarterback options now for #Giants. Hear from Pat Shurmur &amp; Eli on @fox5ny #GDNY &amp; we have lotsa #HOCKEY! #NYR moving up the standings on their #HFC night at Garden, #Islanders Barry Trotz gets his ring but not the W. #Devils tryin’ to break slump.
@SCalvelliJr @fox5ny I believe in the curse now. HOW do the Red Bulls end with that result after the way they played all season?? Or ... honestly, how does Atlanta decide to wake up and finally beat NY? Supernatural stuff. #CurseofCaricola
What makes a Monday morning worse? Look at ur NFL teams’ records, New York. Ouch. 3-and-8. Coming at ya this AM on @fox5ny #GDNY.  For #RBNY fans, is it even worse waking up down 3-0 in #MLSCupPlayoffs East Finals? OUCH I’m just a buzz kill this AM.  Hey, #Knicks win!
Tonight on @fox5ny #SportsXtra, @QuincyEnunwa joins me! While he was down about #Jets loss to #Patriots, we chat about game, team growing pains this year, his great comeback from surgery &amp; how he sees a bright future. Plus, learn about his 12/3 event! Meet Quincy &amp; help kids. https://t.co/3IRyvececQ
Well this is NOT good.  (most obvious statement in sports today) as Red Bulls go down 3-0 now on road in Atlanta.  WOW. Atlanta United has never beat #RBNY since coming into the league. @TaylorTwellman eviscerating back line right now, OUCH.
Red Bulls ... Knicks ... Nets ... Devils ... still time to salvage this Sports Sunday. Big time too. #RBNY #MLSCupPlayoffs
Well, that just took the wind out of our sails in the @fox5ny Sports Office ... watching the #Eagles and #Patriots score ... simultaneously.  #buzzkill #seasonkill ... #Giants still w 10:11 to go to maybe save this.  It's all about the Giants offense. DEF continues to struggle.
10:30 AM on @fox5ny watch “Giants Kickoff” ~Eli Manning joins @russsalzberg with some of the most telling answers we’ve heard from Eli this year! Then @giantswfan &amp; I do drills. 🤣😂 as #Giants go for their 3rd straight win.  Paul does give us some “Inisder info” too! https://t.co/OA5s9xqDuS
You have to just hope now, that Darnold will be able to get the experience of playing in a game against Tom Brady when #Jets travel to N.E. to face #Patriots on Dec. 30th. https://t.co/2jSGLfC1CP
Saw @creedmovie in previews &amp; LOVED it! Might even be better than original #Creed. My #Newark native, #Knicks &amp; #Giants fan @michaelb4jordan was phenomenal, but now I also have a crush on father &amp; son #drago ⁦@big9nasty⁩ &amp; @dolph_lundgren. #justsaying 👀🤷🏻‍♀️🤣 #Creed2 https://t.co/uOiZneiQVG
@grumpyadamek And ... we saw less golf on TV then.  Less access to televised practice rounds, etc. Now we can watch the channel and Tiger - Phil stuff 24-7. Must see in '99 ... yes.
@TheChrisHart Looking into it.
@KevinEIC yes! I agree! &amp; HI Kevin!! It's where the money is coming from &amp; going that makes it lose it's authenticity.  Look, both are incredibly competitive and want to beat the other ... no doubt, but adding either of those aspects would make it more attractive of an event to invest in.
I love both these guys.  Want them each to win at least another U.S. Open ... #justbecause. But ... who is paying to watch this today? Does anyone feel it's a tad contrived? https://t.co/NuceFsS1KX
My husband @kmacknj is a #cancersurvivor ... so these awareness &amp; fundraising nights in sports, mean a lot! Join @NJDevils today to support #HockeyFightsCancer at their game against the Islanders. Puck drops 4pm. Learn more: https://t.co/XT0TiiFljY #NJDevils #BoyleStrong

Happy Thanksgiving from the @fox5ny studios this AM. Previewing a menu of #NFL football delight for the day! Tons of local games last night on #ThanksgivingEve. Big wins by #Knicks &amp; #Rangers &amp; #Devils. #fox5nysports https://t.co/2nnzAJSO5o
Shurmur says #Thanksgiving theme this week &amp; this plays every week with #Giants culture: How do you show gratitude to your teammates? Play as hard as you possibly can for them each game! For every win, call that person back, who checked in on you when there was a losing streak.
#Giants today: Pat Shurmur says Kerry Wynn remains in concussion protocol, otherwise team looks good for practice. VS Eagles, defense has to stay in coverage &amp; be ready when Wentz goes downfield. “Last we played them ... we didn’t do anything to beat any team.” #fox5nysports https://t.co/CW1uXzMKCT
Happy 14th Anniversary to My Kevin. @kevinmckearney ❤️🤗❤️😘 Love our life together. https://t.co/fC3c4veV23

Everyone at @fox5ny #GDNY enjoying hearing from #Giants after win. My fav quote comes from @saquon "I was in the film room ...&amp; (Eli) came in. I was probably in there for an hour, &amp; he sat down w/me for like 20 minutes &amp; showed me three things that I didn’t even see." #elimanning

Just a normal week covering the #Giants. Ok... it’s better after a win. So @giantswfan &amp; I decide to pull out our best Nate Solder &amp; Saquon Barkley impersonations. Then we eventually did our “Insider” segment for @fox5ny “Giants Kickoff”. https://t.co/uFMiH8r6QQ

@harmonmt Omg so cool
@danbowensfox5 SO happy to hear this. Really is miraculous after seeing THAT! Really fun team to watch and see their development before our eyes.
GOOD news for #Nets Caris Levert! According to Nets diagnosed w/subtalar dislocation of right foot. "no fractures, moderate ligament damage, surgery will not be required, expected to return to full strength &amp; resume all basketball activities without any limitations this season.”
Shockey, Toomer, Barber ... seems like yesterday. #WeAreNotOldEli lol
A back part of my brain just woke up, In '05, just my 2nd year working in NY TV for CBS2, I was on field at Giants Stadium when a very young Eli Manning orchestrated a game winning drive w/under a minute to go v Broncos. I walked right up to Manning on field for interview after.
GREAT quote by @saquon .....   #GiantsPride https://t.co/gC1eOEBoNk
Early #fox5nysports reports on @fox5ny #GDWU &amp; #GDNY following #GiantsP WIN! Watched till end. I'm tired &amp;it's amazing what a little time can do in the pocket. Also addressing loss of #Nets Caris Lavert. 2 #NBA injuries like this in one year's time (Gordon Hayward)...just scary.
Watching Giants, @loualbanese text me, then saw twitter reax to Caris Levert injury.Then saw replay. My heart breaks for him. @JenXperience just did wonderful story on his work mentoring kids &amp; M.S. awareness inspired by his mom’s battle all while becoming an #NBA Rising star.
So GREAT to be on the set together last night @JenXperience !!! #fox5nysports https://t.co/PK2w4HQcVS
@ameeniis @fox5ny At this point, the object is to officially have the position open so the organization can begin their search with still 7 weeks left in the regular season. It also reveals areas of deficiency in team under different leadership. It doesn't even matter who the interim is, IMO.
@AsiaRoberson11 @fox5ny Did you hear shout out?
@GangGreen580 @fox5ny It was jarring how empty that stadium was .... 2nd half!
@TheProspectpark I feel like the Mets and Knicks fall into that category as well. Although so far this year Knicks appear to be heading in a new direction with a true rebuild. This week will say a lot about Jets.
@kyle_neuwirth Omg
On Todd Bowles watch this AM on @fox5ny #GDNY. It’s unfortunate when someone’s job is in peril. This was a great opportunity for all involved #Jets this season to begin transition into new era w/Darnold. Will be interesting to see what path CEO Christopher Johnson takes. #fox5ny
ROYER AGAIN!!!! LESS THAN 3 MINUTES APART.  #RBNY ... TAKE IT HOME!
This is a super great story by @JenXperience on @BrooklynNets young, rising star @CarisLeVert.  Mentorship helped him through is youth ... now he's creating the same opportunities for kids in Brooklyn. @fox5ny #SportsXtra 10:30 PM https://t.co/9JUH5EMKoz
DANIEL. ROYER. GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  HOLD ON LADS ... HOLD ON!!!! #RBNY #MLSCupPlayoffs .... Red Bulls up 2-1 on aggregate looking to advance to Eastern Conference Finals.

@angrybison04 @CBSSportsNet I would have loved to talk to Holland, Davidson, Slomka, Riley ... but at some point, Coach had to address the entire team together. LOL
I’ve got Good NY football tonight on @fox5ny #SportsXtra! They’re the most successful team in our area &amp; on #VereransDay this team holds a greater meaning. After winning 12 straight at Michie Stadium &amp; retaining #CIC @ArmyWP_Football  @CoachJeffMonken joins me. #GoArmy #BeatNavy https://t.co/LhZi1b7aLV
@MarcMljjrl That result was disappointing. Opportunity lost.
@AlohaBoricua @fox5ny The clock is ticking on Bowles.
Where are my #RBNY supporters at? Who's already at @RedBullArena? Emotions right now? Send predictions -----&gt; #MLSCupPlayoffs  #fox5nysports
Any #NYCFC supporters travel to ATL? Emotions? What is atmosphere like? #MLSCupPlayoffs
@TheProspectpark a story, I'm sure many feel the same way about or have experienced similarly.
@SchwartzSports @fox5ny HAHAHAHAHA
#Jets fans, hi, don't do anything stupid. I'm here for you. I'm writing my open for @fox5ny #SportsXtra for tonight. Help me, help you: What's the emotion you're feeling right now about this team, this game? One word. One "usable" word for TV. Thank you. #fox5nysports Go---&gt;

@joefav @CoSIDAnews @APSE_sportmedia @MandyAntoniacci @SBRadio @PRSSANational @markbealpr @ConvergenceTR @malcolm_moran @jon_wertheim @bschillace @TennisPublisher Now 20+ years into this career, and many life lessons learned, as well as countless reports on Mental Health in sports recently, I took my first personal days to just recalibrate &amp; rest. No vacation. No socializing. Amazing what those two extra days did for my mind &amp; body.
@joefav @CoSIDAnews @APSE_sportmedia @MandyAntoniacci @SBRadio @PRSSANational @markbealpr @ConvergenceTR @malcolm_moran @jon_wertheim @bschillace @TennisPublisher Very well written &amp; informative Joe. Of course, my husband &amp; I have known Mex Carey for a long time! I remember him making the move &amp; it brought back when I lived away from my husband to work in BOS. Very difficult. But our passion for sports drives us to make these decisions.

@nydragon69 I agree w Kershaw. Ellsbury may never play again w his injuries. Gardner is a gamer and special Yankee. But his contract is up &amp; age is a factor, don’t think he’ll be back.
@meteloman69 @fox5ny And starting pitching.
@MyCousinJoe @fox5ny I’m totally on the Harper bandwagon myself. Need starting pitching too.
@ChicoBonds @fox5ny lol
Had great nap. Let's talk sports on @fox5ny #GDNY. #RedSox are #WorldSeries Champs for 4th X in 15 yrs. #Yankees win 1 during that time &amp; if don't win in '19, will go Trophy-less this decade. @NewYorkRedBulls are #SupportersShield winners AGAIN! #MLSCup next? #Jets #Giants 👎🏼👎🏼🤦🏽‍♀️
@PGameHD @RedSox @NESN @teamcafemartin @tweetsbyjpm @DunnsRiverProd @WBZPhotog @NBCSCameraGuys ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@teamcafemartin @aemartin37
As #RedSox celebrate #WorldSeries, can't stop thinking about John Martin. Documenting @RedSox meant so much to John before he passed away due to #ALS. Pic w Chirs Deldotto is moments after we were in'07 World Series Clubhouse. #wherescafemartin @teamcafemartinn @PGameHD @nesn https://t.co/XN6cBlUaRP
@tj_fearon @stevosd @fox5ny loving this convo BTW
Sooooo #Yankees fans, with the way Machado played all post season, and seeing him striking out to Chris Sale for the final out of the #WorldSeries to give the #RedSox their 4th title in 15 years.  Would you still take him? #fox5nysports @fox5ny
In my conversation w @GaryMyersNY tonight on #sportsxtra after the #WorldSeries ...Who's safe on #Giants w deadline looming? Gary says Saquon is probably the only non-touchable. So is there a chance for OBJ to get moved? Watch on @fox5ny to hear our discussion. #fox5nysports

@joeknix But I can’t act as a fan. As a sportscaster I have to represent for every team. And that was really meant for my fellow NY sports journos &amp; broadcasters who just want to cover winners at some point, again.
@CandaceDBuckner Congratulations @meghanmcpeak !!! Watched how hard you have worked to get to this. Can say you were my guest on NBA Radio “way back when”. 🤣. Your achievement is so empowering I feel I have to thank you!!

Mickey Callaway on #DavidWright Great for the fans “one of best times I’ve seen them have all year.”  Favorite moment: “When his daughter threw out first pitch.”  On 2 AB:”We wanted to make sure it was the right situation...&amp; get recognized for the great player that he was.”#LGM
What a thrill witnessing and covering David Wright’s last game as a #Mets player for fox5ny. jusssayinnn &amp; I could’ve tried a selfie with the Captain, but third base will have to do.… https://t.co/Zn4tWQ7KyS

I usually don’t tweet on offdays, but can we talk about deGrom’s year now that it is officially over! Tonight, ANOTHER GEM! 8 IN. 2 hits NO RUNS. 10 K’s! 2018 ERA of 1.70. If Lugo holds: 1 more win. He has to win #CyYoung! VOTERS aren’t oblivious about lack of run support. #Mets

Legit question. Today is also day players have ALL their photos taken.

I legit can’t tweet how “making the playoffs” makes @Enes_Kanter feel. 😂🤣 And he just asked a reporter if he was ever in a bar fight. He does love playing for this team! Admits he gets in trouble on social media. At some point he may have mentioned playing hard defense. #Knicks https://t.co/lhqIxWpu0s
Lance Thomas is a leader. Tells it like it is &amp; is very observant. Said culture was different from Fizdale’s 1st press conf. Liked how “as a man”admitted he had to make changes, took mistakes on chin &amp; is willing to learn from that. Also referred to”no favorites”. #KnicksMediaDay
Mario Hezonja “I love that guy!” Talking about Frank Ntilikina. The two European players quickly became close, says he finds Frank “very serious about basketball” ... wants to take him under his wing “even though I’m not much older”. #KnicksMediaDay https://t.co/Pt6jnpGKhR
Courtney Lee ~ on youth &amp; building process w #Knicks,”I’m here in shape ready to compete. Being here w the guys, the culture is different. Coach says we’re going to get out there, but we’re going to check our egos at the door.” ...says source on trade request never talked to him.
No timetable for Porzingis  return, but Tim Hardway Jr. gives som insight... Or hope? Well, he said, “We know he’s not going to Play until the end of the season ...”  #KnicksMediaDay  TBH: I was of thought;hold KP out all year. Why risk? But after seeing him: #CantWait 🤷🏻‍♀️
While it’ll be a while before they play together, #Knicks Rook Kevin Knox talks about meeting Porzingis for 1st time, how he can’t wait to learn from him: moves / terminology, go against him in practice.  ~U can see mutual respect btw two. Will be thrill to see them on court. https://t.co/OcH5JyG0M0
“We’ve done things differently, Because there is no protocol for a 7-3 guy. ... we’re a little conservative. Just have to move forward. Keep progressing. And see when I can come back.” #Knicks @kporzee on his ACL rehab. Says he’s happy how process has gone so far. https://t.co/fsEDddx66S
Kristaps up first. “Feeling good. Leg’s getting stronger. .... doing stuff on the court, shooting, running. Time table is ... there is no time table yet.” #knicks #knicksmediaday https://t.co/CWtpjSwvdU

Speaking of Tiger(s) today. https://t.co/zTmfKo0adQ
@TravisHemiller Um yes. Google Tiger's mug shot, multiple addiction rehabs, divorce, infidelities, collapsing from pain, multiple surgeries. No where to be found near a golf course for 2 years. Money doesn't buy you health, overcoming addictions, reconciliation w/ur children. Even billions.
Give it to Tiger, he hit as rock bottom as you can get as a person, but never gave up on himself or what he wanted: to win again. Many thought with his age and the surgeries, it just might be to difficult to get all the way back. But ... he did! https://t.co/03O7wqDU7i
Oh, and 🐅⛳️🏆! https://t.co/J7y93pCL7Y

Ok. He is JJ Watt.
This is really cool. David returns to Queens this week ... for last time as an active #MLB player. Wow. Saturday will be a special one, but with mixed emotions for #Mets fans for sure. https://t.co/DYmtSJmj7S
I can’t remember a game, where I have yelled aloud “he’s rolling out again!” several times. Because QBs are supposed to do that. Have the time to do that. Today the #Giants have provided the time &amp; protection for 1st time, in a long time. Let’s see if they can keep it up 2nd H. https://t.co/LJSQhuyHYX
A few quick hits here, while I simultaneously write &amp; prep for guests on #SportsXtra: #Giants: was it me or did Eli have a little more time to roll out, fake moves, go through progressions? #ChadWheeler Only 1 series, but also why Saquon had the opp to make great run. TD No. 2

Love when #Knicks Coach David Fizdale gets real. Asked about pressure to win. He speaks of his mother raising him and siblings in Compton working two jobs, missing his games, just to buy a Christmas tree. “That’s pressure!” “I love to win” “this team won’t tank” #takethatfordata
@jamesdennisNY ... And the Nets. And Yankees later today, hosting Giants show tonight, will get back to Mets when they are home next week. Have special Jets &amp; Rangers guests coming on @fox5ny #SportsXtra this Sunday at 10:30pm.
#Knicks Coach Fizdale met w all players this summer, watching workouts, says team is athletic &amp; can play fast, all 5 will handle ball but defense will be foundation. Pressure, switching, trapping. rookies Knox &amp; Mitchell fit exactly what style &amp; schemes they want. #fox5nysports
#Knicks front office standing pat on trades. “Our plan is to not use our draft picks as assets like that.” ~Steve Mills. He and Scott Perry go on to say they are happy with guys on their roster and they feel comfortable building through draft. #JimmyButler #traderequest #nba
#Knicks Prez Steve Mills on #Porzingis: Still have to “go through steps”. As we go through the process there is a series of tests. As he meets certain milestones we’ll move forward with timeline. When he feels comfortable and we feel comfortable we’ll move forward. #fox5nysports
“Let’s go! We’ve talked enough this summer. ... I’m ready to go just because ... commitment of our guys getting in the gym putting in that sweat and equity.” #Knicks HC David Fizdale   #fox5nysports

My live guest on @fox5ny #GDNY is @davediehl66! We’ll talk about how he protected Eli Manning to, 2 #SuperBowl MVPs w #Giants &amp; what adjustments 2018 team needs to do NOW. As well as a program he’s working w @RWJBarnabas on baseline #concussion testing for youth athletes!
Last week on @fox5ny author of  #USFL book "Football for a Buck" @jeffpearlman joined w stories how he collected info on the league’s rise but “crazier demise”. Here our raw, unedited sit down interview w stunning answers not heard in original report. https://t.co/ianayPwu8s

Coming up 6:45AM on @fox5ny #GDWU w/ @sukanya &amp; @JennLahmers Judge &amp; Jury, but thank goodness I'm talking #sports! @TheJudge44 is back in #Yankees lineup. Now it's all about not letting #RedSox celebrate in Bronx! &amp; @Smatz88 is 1st #Mets to do this since 1989...#tunein
Who will be the #Nets closer? Guy with ball in hands coming down stretch? Atkinson: “don’t get into big holes”... spent so much time last year coming back from deficits &amp; spending so much energy in that. Won’t be one guy. “Not built on giving it to one guy.” #BrooklynNets
How do u fix DEF w/similar lineup? Atkinson says it “takes a lot of individual work” as well as “putting in schemes that put players in best position.” “Switching has become so big in #NBA” has talked to Sean Marks about approaching that in camp to improve. #BrooklynNets #Nets
Gosh I love talking 🏀 #NBA basketball. Lol #BrooklynNets HC Kenny Atkinson says a “big theme” this training camp with be “rebounding &amp; toughness”. Ed Davis fills that role &amp; Faried brings physicality. Defense must be improved &amp; creating turnovers. Nets were 30th last year in TO. https://t.co/lNaFpVlomU
Lol. I never finished my tweet before sending. Need ☕️ ... so what I was going to say was... good news #Yankees get Judge back this week &amp; more bad news for #Giants w Halapio inj. Feel bad for him after fighting to get starting job. This offense needs major reworking this week. https://t.co/liQQe3e69N
Good Morning from @fox5ny #GDNY
All night long, Eli was the one going backwards &amp; on the ground sacked. Hard to fully criticize him with OLine letting everyone through. No time. Feels like entire team is going backwards. Takes defense a half to become effective. In 8 quarters: 1 TD from Saquon &amp; ZERO from OBJ. https://t.co/jhfQKRBGDq
@GaryLevick13 Actually the piece was on Suzyn's cancer battle and how the Yankees helped her through it.  Thanks for not watching.

@BigTymers228 Nice to meet you Dave.
Coming up in moments on @fox5ny News at 10, my story on #DavidWright’s emotional press conference. Why this decision and what to expect on September 29th when he starts at 3B at CitiField for one last time in a #Mets Uniform. #fox5ny #fox5sports
David Wright was a wonderful, exemplary New York Sports Captain. #Mets
Was just clarified by Jeff Wilpon (#DavidWright deferred by looking over) David is not officially retiring at this time he is however entering into “medically unable to play at the major league level”.
Long emotional thank yous to those who have impacted #DavidWright and his #Mets career. @FOX5DESK @fox5ny https://t.co/X5HCABjVQ2
After long emotional thank yous #DavidWright answers question .. after being active in these games, will this be it? He hasn’t said retired. This is what he said. And yes, this is the last time. #mets @fox5ny @FOX5DESK ...goes on to say it’s been debilitating to play games. https://t.co/4OKRptEPrw
#DavidWright #Mets https://t.co/Likmox6C8C
Wright will start at third base on September 29th. #Mets Jeff Wilpon keeps calling this a hard day. David about to thank a long list of people. @fox5ny @FOX5DESK https://t.co/zJm3uNVqzh
#DavidWright will return to field. However.... https://t.co/78P2lCihIG
#Mets #DavidWright https://t.co/6HcAw9PtjI
Large contingent of #Mets players just walked into press conference room. To support David Wright for playing next home stand? I think there may be more news.
@Mountaingal456 @Franklin_Group I can’t stop laughing I think it’s so good.

Your first play is exactly just that. It’s not your career. 🤷🏻‍♀️  Such solid quarterbacking by Darnold since pick6. 👍🏼 His response has been so impressive. 📈 Finishing the half with 2 touchdown drives. 1st TD pass. 🏈#Jets✅

Wow. Well ya know what, Osaka kicked butt all tournament and first set. Love this young player. And after being born in #Japan... she grew up a Long Island girl. Give her credit. Historic. #usopen
Holy moly. Speeding through my DVR to catch up with #usopen. These point / game penalties are harsh. Oh no Serena. This final can’t be decided on this! Osaka has played so well too. I’m getting more stressed out as I watch. Sheesh. She’s melting down.

Love this. #Louisville https://t.co/DvJOs4Gj6R
We knew this was coming for Teddy Bridgewater. Take a second to appreciate his remarkable return to football following that horrific knee injury. Hope to see him flourish and maybe succeed Breese when he retires. For now, it’s apparent Sam Darnold will be your #Jets starting QB. https://t.co/ZSyNt6N9XA
Odell takes responsibility, Brodeur is back, Djokovic gets naked &amp; I play tennis with my coach Venus Williams.  All Coming up on @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5sports
After participating in every practice &amp; going 100% since July 26th, w/o a contract in place, @OBJ_3 says it was a “calculated risk” to show team he wanted to be there, but Trusted teammates not to hurt him... “I’m a player who always practiced hard. From my days at LSU.” #Giants
Despite big contract Odell says “I really haven’t done anything .... my goal has always been to win trophies” ... speaks of his legacy and now responsibility to help team win. Want to bring “energy and light” to teammates. #giants https://t.co/028FJs6AzZ
$95-million man. #giants https://t.co/3yl7EanWTO
#Giants Head Coach Pat Shurmur said Beckham’s contract was always in background, but he continued to practice hard, prove himself. On “passion” getting him in trouble: We talk about that withplayers constantly, to keep their composure. That’s a fine line (passion / competition).
Some of #Giants co owner John Mara addressing media about Odell Beckham Jr. Contract. @fox5ny #fox5nysports https://t.co/Gax2EDFfq1
Thank you, Joe. Just don’t tell anyone I’m having fun! 🎾🏈⚽️⚾️🏀 😂 https://t.co/dHWtGjvsri

In other #Giants news, tune in this Saturday to @fox5ny for the premier of #GiantsKickoff ... I’ll be co-hosting along side @russsalzberg for previews each week. Our season preview is “A New Era Begins” w/1-on-1s w/ Pat Shurmur, Eli, Saquon, Alec Ogletree, Landon Collins &amp; more! https://t.co/GfTj1Csh9S
No Odell today. Will speak to media tomorrow. But I can confirm... #OdellBeckhamJr is one, happy, young man. Just saw him drive off from #Giants Facility, I simply  shouted a congrats, w/window down he gave thumbs up 👍🏼 &amp; “thank you” w a major smile.
Odell will avg around/approx $20 mil first 3 yrs  Here’s what some #NBA guys made last season:  DeMar DeRozan — $27.7mil James Harden — $28.3mil Kyle Lowry — $28.7mil Blake Griffin — $29.5mil Gordon Hayward — $29.7mil Paul Millsap — $30.8mil LeBron  — $33.3mil Steph Curry — $34.7
Was looking up Odell #’s &amp; found this. Great breakdown by @GrahamBarfield Dedicating this to some of the callers I heard on NY Talk radio(when I ran out to get coffee) who said #Giants are soft negotiators, Odell is unproven, Bad deal. WTH people?! He’s a transcendent talent➡️ https://t.co/Sm19u7cMJN
Word is, we will hear from Odell today. #standingby Will he dance? THAT’s the Biggest question now that the BIG question all camp has come down to $95 million answer. #odell #obj #giants https://t.co/cM1luRRbx2
#Giants News ... Last night on #SportsXtra @KimJonesSports and I discussed Odell getting a contract done by opening night. Kim said, “it’ll get done”. And it did ... today ... reported Extension Deal for #OBJ 5-years, $95 million=highest paid WR in #NFL ..record setting numbers! https://t.co/OGIRvenArd

@joefav @LavazzaUSA @usopen @TennisPublisher @usta @JoeConnollybiz @CoSIDAnews @TennisReporters @ConvergenceTR @JeffEisenband @jhd16 @Tennis I’m going to need that coffee when I’m there Tuesday.
Notice the little kid’s jersey 🤣😂. Might be asking dad for a new one soon. 🤭 #Giants #OBJ https://t.co/ML2pFf7Kzw
All I can think about is the amount of times Sam Darnold has been asked questions with Joe Namath’s name in the ques. Would love to know what Darnold was thinking. #Jets https://t.co/azIMOZK4xs
Evan Engram ruled out with a concussion. I knew it was head or neck the way he was grabbing helmet / Head. Ugh. Goes into protocol. #football
And just like that Sharp drops another potential first down. #Giants
Interesting battle for #Giants (other) WR role/roster spot between Hunter Sharpe and Corey Lattimer. Sharpe has proven tonight he can be a return man too.
#Jets March down field: 75 yd drive is under 7 minutes, finishing w Powell 10-yard TD run, after a Darnold 14-Run. Pocket collapsed ... he didn’t flinch. Took off. Has to be your Opening (Monday) Night starting QB.  IMO #fox5ny (#Giants DEF, another story 🤔)
I won’t do play by play. Enough peeps tweeting that tonight. But after huge ovation for #Jets Sam Darnold as he took field. Rookie is impressive. Nice 1st down completion to Quincy Enunwa. Next play didn’t panic under pass rush pressure. #Giants DEF was penalized anyway. #fox5ny
#Giants Saquon Barkley in full uniform, warming up, catching passes, cutting, accelerating. https://t.co/I752yNOgWb

Good AM from @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5nysports, hope parents of young ball players r watching, I have tips taught in tee-ball. 😱 As for Jake deGrom, u would think w/10K's...I won't go there. Been thinking of getting B12 in an IV, guess I would be suspended from swimming.🤷🏽‍♀️

@KevinEIC @michellegingras @NewYorkRedBulls @EdCagg1 hahahaha
@abutler04 I feel so bad for him.  You could see him declining during the game on Friday night.  I was there.  Started hitting 99 mph, then the velocity dropped.  Luckily there are antibiotics, and ways to attack this.  But just the fact he has to deal with this is awful.
@Garyw6t7 @fox5ny It's almost scary.
@RyanWalt525 @fox5ny YUP! That's the proper, medical term, that in no way I will say on TV in case I mess it up.....
@sofiamaria2009 OMG

@diannaESPN Omg. That was my faaaaavvvvv! Best mix all weekend. I used to tape it. (I said tape.) #old
“What we’ve seen from our team the first half was unfortunately not competitive but we also haven’t seen most of our team. ... injuries are part of the issue, I understand that.” #Mets interim GM John Ricco. https://t.co/2Fz7eS4KDd
More #Mets John Ricco “I’m one of 3 (GMs) right now &amp;we are discussing what we’ll look like moving forward” “lots of phone calls”... it’s not just limited to trade market, there are things we are doing in player development...talking to Mickey about that &amp; international scouting.
John Ricco speaking on #Mets at deadline &amp; other topics. Cespedes at first is a possibility. Will work out there. Was staff idea. He was willing. But his health will be closely watched. Team has lots of corner outfielders but instead of trading, key is getting them healthy.

@abates04 Yes. Nadal was magical. But it wasn’t 4 hours and 14 minutes and I hopped in a car to drive 2 hours right after so i wasn’t about to tweet.
Bar is packed at @Eganandsons but I can see the soccer coaches from #England ... I did a story on last night on @fox5ny ... across the bar. They’re barely moving. Not blinking. Not drinking. Just fixated on 1-1 match on screen. So nervous. #worldcup #eng #cro
@MarcCalnan four hours and 14 minutes~
@Francesko182 I know. Kinda shocking he lost ... but what a great effort by Anderson.  Such a closely matched battle.
#federeranderson .... still going. And it's been fabulous. #Wimbledon
👀 https://t.co/v12lmDTI2A
Let’s talk a little #Wimbledon this hour 🎾 on @fox5ny #GDNY (in addition to #yanks &amp; #Mets losses 🙄). #worldcup update of course, #Ronaldo move 😱 🇮🇹 ... next hour you’ll hear more tactical on-site from #English coaches now in #America on #EnglandvCroatia #ENG #CRO
@elmhurstnyc @fox5ny Insane depth and talent on that team and so exciting to watch with all the energy Modric plays with. #cro #worldcup
@jason_balsan @fox5ny @NewYorkRedBulls @MSGNetworks No, I am the full-time sports anchor at #fox5ny now. Please continue to follow! Thank you!
I talked to a couple soccer coaches *from* #England yesterday, who came to the #USA to coach American youth &amp; teach them proper international football. Hear what they have to say (&amp; it’s technical) about how #ENG can beat #CRO in today’s #WorldCup Semis. #GDNY @fox5ny 6:45AM! https://t.co/npFhGrpCCx
@MarkFishkin That translate button is a doozy. 😜
Who will play #FRA in the #worldcup Final? There are several soccer coaches in Montclair &amp; Newark, NJ that are a tad nervous, because they’re from #England &amp; have been in US since ‘03 coaching American youth: international football. Meet the #ENG coaches next on @fox5ny #fox5ny
So good. https://t.co/XlEy9rtOBt
With @fox5ny #SoccerXtra #WorldCup Continuing Coverage, I went to @RedBullArena yesterday to find out what #FIFA was doing there on a site survey back in April. Could RBA be used as a #WorldCup2026 Venue? Watch #GDNY to find out. #RBNY
If u missed @ShepMessing1’s great insight last night on #SoccerXtra previewing #WorldCup semis ...I bring the most important details this hour (#FRA Mbappe &amp; #ENG Pickford) &amp; again at 8 AM (Theirry Henry’s impact on #BEL &amp; #CRO Sabasic’s injury) on @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5nysports https://t.co/vrjfyPlw1T

We have a Sunday 6PM News tonight on @fox5ny, which means early #fox5nysports! #Yankees survive 10 in TOR, Herman comes through, Gardy w/a winner. #Mets lucky to not be embarrassed by a perfect game, but embarrassed by a shutout. Help on way? Syndergaard in rehab start w Cyclones
and he was so darn nice to every person he ever made contact with. He was a leader to me by example. And his wife, Kim is EXACTLY the same way. I'm not a soccer player, I never played for @jessemarsch but he was such a great coach to me. #cheers &amp; #goodluck
a different path than you've planed. To continue to educate yourself, do different things than other people expect &amp; always bring positive energy. I watched him continue to educate himself by traveling to Europe &amp; now he'll be rewarded. Risk w/ positive energy brings reward ...
a player is better on one side of the field as a back compared to another &amp; to recognize different overlapping runs that led to choreographed attacking plays. Because I'm a journalist, not a analyst &amp; he always took the time. Most importantly, Jesse inspired me to embrace...
&amp; demand for excellence &amp; leadership showed in the results with his team. Look, it's hard to win #MLSCup. The Parity of #MLS last few years has proved that. I learned so much from Jesse about the game, how shape impacted pressure, tactics impacted playing fast, or not, why ...
big supporter &amp; inspiration when I went through a job change. I learned so much from his story after Montreal &amp; choosing to take a year to travel w/ his family all over the world. It turned into a story I got to tell for a @NewYorkRedBulls broadcast. His thirst for education ...
Making a concerted effort this summer to not tweet days I'm off (my weekend). Totally cheated by reading through some #WorldCup stuff yesterday &amp; liked friend's stuff on IG, lol ...but it is quite wonderful. NOW time to catch up. Bear with me: #JesseMarsch #RBNY ...Jesse was a...

@REast_Eazy @GetSpectrum @fox5ny It's going top be a great match though. England is playing at a high level, but their styles will clash.  So exciting.

What a performance by #KOR Goalkeeper ... and their back line just did enough to prevent #Ger from finishing.  #Germany is OUT. #MEX gets through after being destroyed by #SWE .... wow, that was fun. #WorldCup
@blvck__pharaoh 2nd goal makes up for it. lol
Mexico loves South Korea ...
VAR OMG .............
#mex fans watching the #ger #kor game on their phones and crying from inside the stadium in Russia ... not over yet ... not over yet ... (great cutaway shot by @FOXSports ) #WorldCup
I'm screaming all by myself in the @fox5ny sports office.  Where are you @ErikaWachter &amp; @loualbanese ?!?!  ... the News reporters are so not happy with me right now outside our door! #WorldCup #MEXSWE #GERKOR
OMG #GER is pressing. can't finish ... #MEX still in ... for this current minute.
Group F. My goodness. Down to the last 5 minutes of group play.  #WorldCup (download the @FOXSports app if you are missing this!!!!)
Dios Mio! #SWE has been brilliant v #MEX ~from 1st half in the way they are attacking. I said, I hope not scoring on that set piece doesn't come back to bite them in a 1-0 game, uh no ... they score 3 straight, playing to Mexico's physicality &amp; drawing those Penalties. #WorldCup

@mjvenesco @AnthonyMSG It’ll be on Sunday night on @fox5ny 10:30PM we are calling it “Soccer Xtra” during World Cup but of course I’ll have NBA Draft and my interview wi Knox!!
@BookofJose 3 year plan. Never said they would win a championship. And frankly, until LeBron and Steph are Old and done, they won’t any time soon. But wouldn’t you like more than 25 wins?
@AnthonyMSG @espn Thank you. Over staged. Knox couldn’t stop talking about his family to me in interview room. Talked about making his siblings proud. Being strong &amp; confident with challenge of playing in NY. That was all lost on this focus on Knicks fans booing every single pick. Old news.
@perezrafaelmcpo Fizdale will bench him if he doesn’t.  Works players very hard. Will call guys out.
@HandicapperFAL I don’t think he’s healthy. Fell fast in draft.
I like this reax! Still has to develop body and 3-point shot. At 18 ... There’s time. #Knicks in rebuild. It’s about free agency now in ‘19-‘20! #NBADraft https://t.co/6pLuzKTp9S https://t.co/6pLuzKTp9S

With the 9th pick ... the #Knicks select Kevin Knox! And clearly #Fortnite keeps him going! #tiltedtowers #nbadraft https://t.co/YmVUsO6uiB
So what do you guys think of #Knicks picking #Kentucky’s Kevin Knox? Can’t go wrong with a Calipari player. Has length, can shoot the ball, go-to shooter potential w athleticism. Super young! 18! Rebuild is on. How will he look alongside KP when he returns? #fox5nysports
Perfect night. No filters. All fun for a great… https://t.co/NX7K3rUN8O

@Feliciantics @fox5ny No trading Frank or KP ... not tonight! lol
@KarateManMase @barclayscenter @fox5ny Yes and Yes, and I think in the end it may just depend on who is there at 9. Hearing Knox is top of list though.
@SCAMUSIC @barclayscenter @fox5ny It's deep for the lottery picks but no real convincing "sure things" ... IMO ... I don't think Young is there at 9. Maybe ... who knows? lol
And if you're really daring ... we actually recorded this while doing an IG LIVE! ... It's still on my IG @tinacervasio #WorldCup coverage on @fox5ny #fox5nysports !! We talk #Messi #ARG #POR #MAR #ESP ... and I forget the rest because it was early... https://t.co/oeKk1N2Ei8

@ITsDibiase I think Knicks are really leaning this way too. Not as risky as Porter, Jr. Hope he doesn't get picked up earlier though ... like ... Curry 2009. ouch
@TheRealARShy @barclayscenter @fox5ny Yeah, but will Bamba be there at 9? I agree on Kyrie.
@Megan82189681 @barclayscenter @fox5ny I like Mikal too.  Been on his team since Big East Tournament!
Alright #Knicks fans talk to me. It's #NBADraft but there doesn't seem to be a consensus fav who fans want. Knicks gotta get it right tonight. Could impact free agency this summer AND next! Tell me who YOU want. I'll be at @barclayscenter tonight for @fox5ny #fox5nysports

I LOVE WATCHING GAMES W/ PEOPLE FROM PORTUGAL, MEXICO, SPAIN, IRAN, FRANCE, GERMANY, COSTA RICA, PANAMA &amp; SEEING THEIR PASSION. I DON'T THINK RONALDO'S HEADER WAS FIXED TODAY.
@Francesko182 The story is Sean Marks dumped Mozgov's huge salary due in 19-20 season making room for a free agent max contract signing.

@AVRBNY Congratulations!
According to @FOXSports #Neymar will be fine for tomorrow's practice. His right ankle was bothering him from all the hits, tackles he took vs #SUI  so he left training. It's not the area of the foot that was operated on. #WorldCup #BRA
Yikes! Neymar limping off #BRA training field today in Russia.  #WorldCup  .... doesn't look good with him favoring that surgically repaired foot.
Gah ... forgot to tweet before my #WorldCup #SoccerXtra Segment presented by @GetSpectrum. So for 7:45 'll still bring Day 5 highlights, a look at today's matches, #Yankees #Mets &amp; some #Knicks news too.  All on @fox5ny #GDNY. Then at 8:45 #WorldCup memories from a #FRA legend!
@ZigFracassi Same here Zig!!!!
@Francesko182 @fox5ny @OfficialVieira @NYCFC @ogcnice Haha. Patrick did say it was so difficult to walk away losing on PK’s to Italy! But he said he was so proud of that France team in 2006 because they were never expected to make it to finals.
We go back in #WorldCup time on @fox5ny ... I had the chance to talk to @OfficialVieira before he left @NYCFC for @ogcnice. He shared some of his memories of #FRA winning in ‘98 &amp; why his fondest memories are actually from 2006 when #France was runner up!  #worldcup

Boone says it’s hard to not have Aaron Hicks in the lineup. But it’s also been hard to get him in there with a lot of good players. No DH this series will make it harder. But no other real reason why he hasn’t started much lately. #yankees #SubwaySeries #fox5nysports
Aaron Boone “whether he’s at Citi Field or Yellowstone Park” if he’s in a rhythm and feels good he’s going to “rake” balls out of there ... #Yankees Manager on Giancarlo Stanton who has 21 career home runs at CitiField v #Mets. #fox5nysports #SubwaySeries https://t.co/OBR1wNTFKS
In other news: #Happiness is whenever I can talk #soccer w athletes in different sports. I just tabbed #Mets Adrian Gonzalez my go-to for #Mexico at #FIFAWorldCup ~Gonzalez said he’s excited &amp; Will watch every game, even get up for #Eltri if they have 8 AM starts. #fox5nysports
Mickey Callaway says bullpen is in a tough spot. No Famillia. Lugo now goes to starting. .... more on Syndergaard: he had more swelling in that finger after his bullpen. Needs to ice more. Etc. #Mets  #fox5nysports https://t.co/mp3fdxP76U
#Mets #syndergaard will NOT pitch Sunday versus #yankees. Seth Lugo gets the start. Could be ready for next start. Just not ready. Soreness.
#Mets Todd Frazier who will play both sides of #subwayseries now says “absolutely” there’s still juice in this series. Great for city. Glad Mets start at home. But news of Famillia on DL was a surprise. A downer “hurts the team.” #fox5nysports
Okay. #subwayseries 2018 ....#Mets Brandon Nimmo talking about the return of Todd Frazier and the impact of his verteran presence. But will team start hitting? Says team needed that day off yesterday. Feels this is good chance to get things going.

Seeing Bourdain’s smile &amp; how he made people feel around him saddens me even more. Was a huge fan. Would spend hours talking to my dad about #PartsUnknown. Dad about food &amp; location. Me about #Bourdain. The production, TV awareness to tell a story... https://t.co/EvAr8tPsTO
There’s an impactful thread going on started by @MikeDrucker ... I just recommend the read.
Needs to be done. More than awareness &amp; ending the stigma, but actuall healing, guidance, helping those hold on a little long to see there is a way. But it’s there where I’m at a loss of words. We can be nicer to people but that doesn’t heal the disease or remove the demons.
What terrifies me most about the deaths of Anthony Bourdain &amp; Kate Spade is how young people who are suffering see this. Even if someone hasn’t been “diagnosed” there are dark places of loneliness, anger, not living up to your own expectations as well as others. So much more ...

While I’m sure Shamorie Ponds is disappointed he has to wait to achieve his #NBA dream, him returning to St. John’s next season is great news for #SJUBB. This Is why I like the #NBADraft rule if u don’t sign an agent you can defer original draft declaration &amp; return to school.

@BoroKnicks @Brian_McLachlan @IanBegley @MokeHamilton @AnthonyMSG @TommyBeer @Ticketmaster @TeamStubHub This is great advice for you Brian. Don’t listen to naysayers. The experience of watching a #Knicks game at the Garden is very unique in sports. Well worth it.
Just woke up from my nap for #NBADraftLottery ... never as much drama as Expected. #Knicks stay to form getting No.9 pick. #Nets pick goes to #Cavaliers ... which was #Celtics for a while but they traded for #Kyrie. And Jami Gertz is a #Hawks owner! Best thing I’ve learned today.
@Delblogo I had the same reaction.

With legal betting on sports coming soon to NJ, what kind of impact will it have on sports? I think sports as we know it has changed. Should I always give betting lines in reports? Or no. Some say it's much ado about nothing, because NEV has done it forever. @fox5ny #fox5nysports
Back at it! Good Morning from @fox5ny #GDNY with some updates from last night’s games &amp; if you missed @SurvivinAmerica ... hear a clip from #Giants mom Annie Apple on from my #SportsXtra #mothersday segment.

Tonight on @fox5ny #SportsXtra Annie Apple joins me in studio to talk about rewards &amp; challenges being an NY Sports Mom! Annie opens up how her surgery impacted her son #Giants CB Eli Apple on &amp; off field last year &amp; her new foundation “Raising a Pro”. #mothersday #fox5nysports https://t.co/spCApxUWrE
Seriously, I know they're not coming as often as fans want ... but when #Giancarlo connects on those homers, it's just violent.  That ball ... get. out. of. its. way. #sheesh #Yankees
@CoachTahjHolden The defense, the plays, the hustle, ... with their stars nowhere in sight.  Seriously ... will it take him Lifting the Larry O-trophy for someone to finally admit, Brad Stevens is a basketball genius?
@StevenLacy See you soon!
@rywatty88 Plus the warmup ... wait for rain delay ... 2nd warmup ... they were counting all those pitches too.
#Mets say there's nothing wrong with deGrom according to broadcast.  Pulled after 45 pitches in first inning. I get that it was a taxing inning, and he's coming off a missed start, cold, wet, &amp; delay ... but anyone else still concerned? Curious?

#Yankees #RedSox in the Bronx &amp; there’s a new #Fiz at the Garden. At 5:50 @fox5ny David Fizdale on why he took the most challenging job in #NBA  ~He reveals who he’s been consulting with. I had to ask the question &amp; we got answers: Pat Riley! Now it’s time to rebuild #Knicks https://t.co/TvrOSmhmQE
@Simply27Rings Awww thanks.
I was blown away by Steve Mills thorough comments about their interactions with Riley. And Fizdale clearly continues to talk to him. This is so good. So good. #Knicks https://t.co/DA1SctTGZi
Key quotes from Coach Fiz: Porzingis “he’s the future of the #NBA” flying to Latvia “very soon!” On point guards “guards! Guards!” Says Joakim Noah has already reached out to him “No cap on anybody”. ... “want to play w speed, up &amp; down th floor, after great defense” #Knicks
Steve Mills keeping it real. After Fizdale answers question about off the court challenges coaching in NY .... Mills says we will help him navigate everything ... “we’ve had to put out brush fires ... forest fires”  media laughs. #knicks #nymedia
#Knicks Steve Mills says they interviewed 11 candidates. Then interviewed other coaches they worked for, front offices, players ... to make sure candidate matched their criteria with right characteristics to help them identify their next Head Coach. #DavidFizdale

@aka_hustle97 70’s! Lol
Brad Stevens + ATOs = savage.
Wow. This #BOSvsPHI game. And I keep thinking ... Tatum and Simmons are ROOKIES. Embiid still so young  ... next decade could be tough for #Knicks &amp; #Nets.
#RBNY Jesse Marsch on @BWPNINENINE “he loves Derbies. He grew up in Derbies... when I first saw him today he was glowing.” (Personal note: was great to run into brother @swp29 !!!) #DerbyFamily #Londoners playing in #USA #beautifulgame #NYDerby
Back to #NYDerby ....#RBNY Jesse Marsch “really good start .... usually can sit back, take pressure...Instead guys stayed on it, stuck to the game plan... Kaku ... is great, he’s only getting better, he’s adjusting quite well.”
And in other news, I mean WOW ... #Yankees win &amp; are now 14-1 in last 15!
Vieira on #RBNY Kaku, “we knew he was a really good player ... but we are not going to change our tactics or philosophy depending on who we play”. Lots of talk about the battle of the midfield. Tried to adjust to 4 in mid vs RBNY’s 3, but coming back from 3 down at half. #NYDerby
#NYDerby Post: Patrick Vieira “really frustrating.... I’m really frustrated” at lack of energy, competitiveness, desire of way #NYCFC came out. “We have to change the attitude because the attitude wasn’t good tonight.”
Thank you @NewYorkRedBulls for giving me my old seat for today’s #NYDerby match.   #RBNY 4 #NYCFC 0 .... #NYisRed https://t.co/UfkwZVDB3u

Loving the reax of my colleagues around newsroom, may who didn't know who David Fizdale was. After seeing "Take that for Data!" SOT they're saying, "who is that ... he's cool ... I like that guy".  I answer "He's the #Knicks new coach, but ... team needs players." #debbiedowner
Today’s @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5sports:  #Knicks hire Fizdale🏀 #Yankees rally⚾️  #Mets shutout😫  #NYDerby ⚽️🔵vs🔴 #KentuckyDerby🏇🏽 #RIPTorrey🏒
Coming up in th A-Block @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5nysports ... #Knicks hire Fizdale.
@DorianVelasquez LeBron is a big advocate of Fizdale. That is all you need to know about his relationships and communicating. LBJ
Continues to tell me .... “No ceiling on players... sees more in them than others have... frees them to be more than they’ve even considered...”. And confirms Fizdale was popular and well liked by LeBron &amp; Dwayne Wade. #Knicks
A source close to #Knicks new hire David Fizdale says “He’s directly from the Riley Spo way... no excuses...demands excellence...work hard... practice &amp; drill a lot... &amp; there is only one thing... winning... oh yes &amp; misery” (because he demands a lot from players to get results).
#Knicks hire David Fizdale. Talking to people... hearing his ability to communicate with players &amp; media a huge strength. Good Defensive teams followed him from Miami to Memphis as HC. Comes from “Riley Tree”. Worked for Pat as Erik Spolstra’s assistant during Championships.
#RBNY @NewYorkRedBulls defenders Michael Amir Murillo &amp; Fidel Escobar are going to #WorldCup2018!!! After leading #Panama to their 1st ever @FIFAWorldCup appearance. Over next month, watch @fox5ny for our lead up coverage to #WorldCup on @FOXSports 📸@whitelaw827 https://t.co/Om9uQkr0hE

@neoconfederate1 @fox5ny yeah, Conforto 0-for-4 last night, I still think give him time to get a better rhythm. But yes ... you never know how guys come back from these.
Good AM from @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5nysports ... #Yankees fans, what r ur concerns w Jordan Montgomery's elbow? How's rotation looking? Always exciting days Luis Severino pitches, but are they deep enough? #Mets fans, Syndergaard was great after 1st inning, but does that matter to u?

@EBS9291 That was supposed to say “pretty funny” .... which I’m sure you realized. 😆
@KennethFarquha2 Thanks Kenneth.
@EBS9291 That is pretty you noticed that and maybe it's a foreshadowing of the success to come.
@StephanieCT123 It's was a former Sports star &amp; one time MVP of his League ... we talked about baseball the whole first half of the interview.  Sports is part of culture, and Mo Vaughn is a great example of a retired athlete transitioning into a successful career. That's what that was about.
I'm not letting him leave the studio.  (but is that imprisonment?) https://t.co/xiyTjQz8QQ

@Diamondjn1 They did. And I was sleeping lol

#Jets #SamDarnold handling rapid fire questions from NY Media, says he’s a confidant person but quiet confident and serious. But adds he can be a “funny dude”. Understands #Jets history of not having a franchise QB for longer than he’s been alive. Talks about opportunity. https://t.co/wUG9NTQ5JW
Father at home. Mentor at work. Can be the dad and mentor at work now. 😂🤣 #Jets #SamDarnold https://t.co/KIA5Utclo8

On windy days at @MLStadium #Giants can run the ball w #SaquonBarkley &amp; #Jets can rely on strong arm of #SamDarnold ... I pull my hair into a side ponytail. Live on @fox5ny GDNY. https://t.co/DiLGFutO2g
I am SO EXCITED @pennyhendrixx goes first round! 27th overall pick to Seahawks ... Covered him several times when I was doing sideline for @CBSSportsNet ... just a thrilling Running Back, stays on his feet and can break tackles for 90 straight yards!
@trojanprincess4 Thanks. Interesting.  Good for him!!!
@bobrock1975 Exactly what you want to hear from your QB.
@TheRealGenovese So true.
@abstractanalyst Talked to people today who thought the Jets were actually targeting him, especially because of his big arm.
@billyskouteris @saquon Yes, a reporter with an opinion, who wants to cover winning teams and I LOVE who both the Giants and Jets just picked. Because all week I have been REPORTING on why each of them are great players and how they will help whoever picks them.
"A lot of wins, that's what I think I can bring that franchise." #Jets Draft Pick and new QB, #SAMDARNOLD to Dion Sanders #NFLDraft  (guys ... what's his twitter ... can't find verified account!?)
Time for me to write my Good Day New York Scripts, just awaiting what #Jets &amp; #Giants GMs &amp; Coaches have to say! Join me LIVE from Met Life Stadium tomorrow morning on @fox5ny starting at 6:30 AM! I'll be talking about how the football in that stadium, just got a TON better!
#Jets get their franchise QB ... #SamDarnold ... WOW! Just 20 years old ... The Future is HIS ... and #GangGreen.  Jets fans ... tell me your thoughts! I think they are lucky Darnold "fell" to them.  GREAT kid too.  BUT ... does another USC QB worry you? Not me. #fox5nysports
Love this. https://t.co/TF8IITPefP
Eli, Odell, and Sterling ... Just got better with that man #SAQUONBARKLEY in the backfield. Mr. Nate Solder ... time to go to work! #Giants #GiantsPride #fox5nysports "I believe in Eli. I believe in OBJ." ~@saquon to Dion Sanders #NFLDraft
#Giants yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes @saquon ... Okay, that was my opinion!!!  #GiantsPride ... WHAT DO YOU THINK???????  #fox5nysports
pick is in ... #Giants
Mike Mayock about just had a heart attack with Baker Mayfield selected by Browns announcement. (those sounds!) #NFLDraft Hey #Jets fans what do you think? Did u think Mayfield would still be there at 3? U can't predict anything, but I was hoping Jets would get him. #fox5nysports
@jenn011nj Awesome. Thanks
@jenn011nj Please vote!!! Thanks!
@therealnovakal @fox5ny Who's "ure"? And ... Giants can then trade the Bills pick to get back to 4 or 5 and maybe still get anyone of those players.  It's about who the fans "want". How they get them will be predicated on the Browns pick.
#NewYork &amp; #NewJersey football fans ... Let's keep doing this! #NFLDraft Now for the #Jets Fans: Who do YOU want? Lot's of #Quarterbacks here ...  #fox5nysports #NFL #GangGreen @fox5ny (wish I could add more players, reply if you have another pick)
Okay #NewYork &amp; #NewJersey ... Let's do this! #NFLDraft I'll begin with the #Giants Fans: Who do YOU want? #fox5nysports #NFL #GiantsPride @fox5ny (wish I could add 3 more players, so reply if you have another pick)

@mweiner29 Such a great point. I find players these days aren’t all receptive to former players advice though. Harvey’s pride was hurt. He may come around though as he performs and gets great support. Winning will help.
@MathTeach44 @mattsdad101 @VikingArmy_SC Great question... The World Cup!
@mattsdad101 @VikingArmy_SC I went to college to be a sport journalist. The first thing we’re taught is to stop being a fan. I was not employed by the Red Bulls. I was employed by MSG. And I got a dream job, my own show &amp; a long contract from FOX5. Guess what. I cover all 12 pro NY teams. RBNY and NYCFC.
@2reel4you Because it was my assignment today. To get paid. 🤣☺️😊
@mattsdad101 @VikingArmy_SC Like I tweeted to several other. It’s called a job. Employment. FOX5 is my job. I not longer work for MSG and announce Red Bull’s games. If I don’t do this. I don’t get paid. This is not a fan thing. You can totally pay my mortgage if you want. 🤣☺️😊
@mmonfet @VikingArmy_SC It’s a job. You may have heard of them. 😝🤣
@Cramordap @VikingArmy_SC Nope. Just doing my assignment for the day. Wait till next week and ya’ll will feel foolish for reacting like this. 😗😉
@R3dBullz15 @VikingArmy_SC It’s. A. Job.
@VikingArmy_SC My full time job is at FOX5. This was my assignment today. I’d give it all up if you guys want to pay my mortgage, car payments, send me on a European vacation, but my clothes, gifts for my family ... lol should I continue. #ajobisajob

Tonight at 6 PM on @fox5ny with @ErnieAnastos ... what went wrong with Jeff Hornaceck &amp; what’s next for #Knicks. #fox5nysports https://t.co/EJiH7cejRh
#Knicks Tim Hardaway Jr says Hornaceck was great &amp; he had career year under him, but not everyone bought in. Says all 3 years he’s been in organization “it’s been losing”. This will be his 5th head coach overall &amp; says he doesn’t even know what kind of coach could succeeed here. https://t.co/uN9v0nspyK
Cheers to @IanBegley ... asking Mills and Perry about #Knicks coaching candidates ...saying who “the next man or woman may be ....”
Patience. Defense. Toughness. Words being used a lot by #Knicks Prez Steve Mills &amp; GM Scott Perry. Mills says “Jim (Dolan) has given us room to be patient (in a rebuild) ...not something that has been commonly associated with this team... patience to develop....”
#Knicks Mills &amp; Perry said it was last year they implemented a plan, over 3 years or so, to BUILD a sustainable winning team. After evaluation, felt team needed new voice. They say “no more quick fixes” like this “organization has done many times before”. https://t.co/2uxClznSF4
It’s become an unfortunate tradition at #Knicks. Every 2-3 years a press conference on a coach firing. The next hire will be the 11th coach (including interims) since Jeff Van Gundy left December 2001. https://t.co/biL5C1p0FG
@RedsArmy_John He’s Coming to FOX 5 April 25th. Mark your calendar.
@Francesko182 I do think so. Read about him in G League this past season.
@KosbergL And for the record, I have been asking for a Red Bull’s guest in studio. Not my fault if their schedule conflicts or if team can’t get them to NYC.
@KosbergL Did highlights ALLLLLL yesterday morning when they lost in CCL semis. They did not play last night and don’t have a game until Saturday.
@PGar99 Thank you very much.  This means a lot.  Saw both tweets. Really appreciate it .

@RobertDavis7 @fox5ny But Horaceck was breaking news.  People knew the Mets won at 9:30 pm last  night.
#Knicks Steve Mills &amp; Scott Perry announce "Jeff Hornacek has been relieved of his head coaching duties," also saying "Jeff is a true professional who has worked tirelessly for this organization the last two seasons. We sincerely appreciate his efforts..." Kurt Rambis fired too.
@RobertDavis7 @fox5ny This is a news show.  Violence and drama lead! LOL  Mets are in there though! Plenty of love!

@nyychick @fox5ny I agree. It was forward momentum on the slide and you go feet first to speed things up and force the infielder off the base. With that, the Red Sox really didn't have to retaliate ... and they did. The you have to stand up for yourself, so batter going after pitcher is expected.
@gmell3 The Knicks have no talent.
A fight. A firing. #NewYork sports this AM! See ya in a few on @fox5ny #GDNY #fox5nysports  What do u think about #Yankees #RedSox brawl. Happy Rivalry is real again?   Who do u want as the next #Knicks head coach? And yes, we tend to ask that question every 2 years around here.
#Knicks fire Head Coach Jeff Hornaceck as well as assistant Kurt Rambis. #NBA Legend, Elgin Baylor gave me a great quote... “you can be a good jockey, but what if they give you a mule? To be a good coach you need talent” ~Countdown to the draft &amp; another new coach at The Garden.
@theisinnyc Oh dear. Yes. Some hard games to watch with that team. Then and unfortunately now. Lol
@PaulCarrTM Thank you so much for taking the time to listen. That means a lot.
@theisinnyc @rosannascotto @loristokes @InesRosales Fans stick with games. Yes! But sometimes it is painful when team is done 13 runs too. ~We haveget up at 1:30 in the morning for work. So you can’t count us. Lol I watch hours and hours of games on DVR.

@jwcortes @fox5ny @BMarshall JW! Thank you so much for watching, and I appreciate you saying how you connected with this. Brandon has a powerful message, and seeing the place he came from before his diagnosis and how hard he works on himself AND to help OTHERS ... is so honorable and can save lives!

Boone says he’s been talking  to his father a lot. Not specific to decisions (Donaldson etc) “he was more like ‘Welcome to Managing’ in reference to roster moves, injuries ... but “he’s very opinionated...very supportive too.” #Yankees
#Yankees Boone on Aaron Judge at the plate  ... “I think he’s really close. He’s Still finding his way on base. ... this is an Extremely small sample ... I think he’s really close, even if he didn’t light it up the first series.”
#rays manager Kevin Cash called #Yankees Boone today and told him Chris Archer will start tomorrow for Tampa Bay.
More on Robertson... they (Boone and Rothschild) did consult with him, he was okay with that decision to intentionally walk. “He was one pitch away. Smoak is a good hitter.”
...I feel good about decisions we make. We evaluate. Review decisions. See what worked. Prepare....”
#Yankees Boone says he was thinking all morning it would be quite an ordeal to play a game today. ...... on how eventful his 1st 4 games were “I realized these games really mean a lot to me...” On second guessing decisions, “I don’t deal with it ...don’t pay attention to it....
Aaron Boone says Jordan Montgomery will still pitch tomorrow at 4:05. #Yankees
#Yankees officially rescheduled for tomorrow, Tues, April 3 at 4:05 p.m. gates open to fans with valid tickets at 2:00 p.m. Pregame ceremonies 3:30 p.m. Fans w tickets for today’s game (April 2) may use them for rescheduled game or exchange for any regular season game at Stadium

@GiantInsider @fox5ny I know. Reported that a while ago. Got keep up with the tweets.
Giancarlo asked “How do you think this park fits your swing?”  @Giancarlo818 sez “It fits nice!” #YankeesStadium #Yankees #postponed
Giancarlo Speaking to media at his new locker: says playing at #YankeeStadium is going to be fun. Has only played 2 games here before. Is looking forward to fans. Never got to play in original Stadium. Can sense he would have loved that opp. #Yankees
New York Yankees make it official.   Today’s game has been postponed due to weather.   Further details to come.  #yankees #yankeesstadium @fox5ny

@Dointhehonors Well Thanks!
@rywatty88 I know. But I also liked the way he rebounded after giving up the homer. Kid is intense.
@dworak_w Thank you Karl, same to you.
@joebattaglia2 Joe, I am praying for you and your daughter at this time. It was an honor to meet your wife a few years ago. Sorry I can not be with you today, I am there in spirit, and will celebrate Luann's wife with you soon.  God sovereign hand is holding you right now.
Holy moly ... Stanton. Really? #OpeningDay And it's only Day 1.  #Yankees
Thor is scary. #MetsTwitter #mets #OpeningDay 1-2-3
Rusty Staub tribute. Preceded by tribute to Ed Charles. Followed by honoring recent losses in #FDNY #mets https://t.co/XsIZTNtGLB
Loudest ovation for non starters. #DavidWright     Hard to determine between Cespedes and Syndergaard for starters. #Mets
.... And I wanted to put him in a position where he can continue that approach. Hitting in front of the pitcher can be a hard thing sometimes, because guys will pitch around you, bury breaking balls, things like that." #mets #lineup #OpeningDay
1 hour until #Mets #firstpitch. When they hit, here’s what Mickey Callaway was thinking hitting Syndergaard 8th. “it takes a little pressure off Rosario. He had a great Spring. He was very patient, compared to what he had done in the past. He worked so hard at it.......
#Mets GM Sandy Anderson sends condolences to Rusty Staub’s family ...said Staub “was devoted to the citizens of NY. ...Sad day for the Mets ... Ironic it’s on #OpeningDay ... perhaps the overcast is an indication how Mets fans are feeling...”
I could have listened to Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez go back and forth with Rusty Staub stories. Hernandez was eventually gifted Staubs’ red book on opposing pitchers. He still has it. #Mets
“I got down there (Florida) Saturday, he was in intensive care for 2 months, he was in a lot of pain, this is better.” A very emotional Keith Hernandez on the passing of his good friend and teammate, Rusty Staub. #Mets
#Mets Keith Hernandez on #RustyStaub ... gets very emotional. “Tough day”. ~Having a hard time speaking at podium. “He’s the one who got me to live in the city ... he’s just been a great friend, but he was in a lot of pain, he’s in a better place.” #RIP
In his #OpeningDay pregame press conference, #Mets Mickey Callaway speaks on his starting pitcher, Noah Syndergaard, “When it comes to baseball,he’s all in &amp; he looks like he wants to beat you up...he gets so intense...that focus can turn to something special”
As per my report on @fox5ny #GDNY, the #Mets immediately implemented a plan to add to Opening Ceremonies... a tribute &amp; moment of silence for the Mets HOFer class of ‘86. https://t.co/CdFUQYksrL https://t.co/CdFUQYksrL

I stink at taking pics. Here’s Harvey, DeGromm &amp; Matz walking away. 🙄Harvey sez “not having to worry about pain, recovering from a surgery, doing normal day 2 day things in training room is nice”. Will focus on “maintaining same mechanics thru long starts” to stay healthy. #Mets https://t.co/8msF8kZecF
Sorry, missed taking a pic of @Noahsyndergaard but he did admit to a hair cut... however it looks more like a trim. 💇🏼‍♂️ #Mets #OpeningDay Pitcher says plan is to control running game, expose hitters weaknesses. Says he’ll go through same routine. More soft tissue work.
Your #Mets Starting lineup as announced by Mickey Callaway: Nimmo CF, Cespedes LF, Bruce RF, Cabrera 2B, Frazier 3B, Gonzalez 1B, Plaweki C, *Syndergaard P, Rosario SS. Batting *Pitcher 8th “takes pressure off Rosario”. #OpeningDay #MLB #fox5nysports https://t.co/EULnqVo80U

@bolognaenzo Every team has multiple supporters groups. Ultras for sure. Songs. Expensive Tifos. Seattle. Portland. Atlanta. Orlando. Some arenas you close your eyes and it sounds like a EPL or Champions League game for sure
@bolognaenzo It’s not trying to be European football. They don’t event call it soccer. It’s Major League Soccer in the United States. It’s it’s own league. Only 22 years old. Why even compare it. It is here. Packing of soccer specific stadiums.

It's #wakeup #sports for ya on @fox5ny #GDNY, #MarchMadness can't get more exciting, unless ur school was a top seed &amp; is done! We've got #Syracuse defying odds, #Cinderella stories coming to an end &amp;a look at #Sweet16 PLUS #Yankees GM Brian Cashman on that fierce bullpen of his.
@VinceGagliardi @WWERomanReigns What did you think over interview? @RedsArmy_John was the producer on it!
@chrislocurcio Yes, he does, however, he's had so many operations (3 to amputate), a port for antibiotics for 16 months, so costs are very high. &amp; Due to using a private donor, that adds to bill. Remember, these guys needed other jobs in off season when they played. Very hard to save.

@rudyamber @bernieandsid I said how I originally was an Odell apologist, and explained why. Then I address his current digression and proceeded to express my turn of opinion and how I am ready to see him go. I'm not being nasty. I am standing up for what I said.  Radio gives you an opportunity to rant.
@rudyamber ... ... @bernieandsid @Flirtyflipper please play my clip back for Mr. @rudyamber ... He clearly did not listen to me yesterday.
@rudyamber I showed these children wearing his jersey in a story I did in January &amp;I said that these children can easily access theses clips &amp; THAT what now makes me go from someone who used to be an Odell apologist, make the move.  Again, who where you listening to yesterday? @bernieandsid
@rudyamber i SAID TIME TO TRADE HIM. I ask you again, who were you listening to.  I said he now DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAN SLATE WITH SHURMUR, and now we wait to see what the head coach and GM in Gettleman have to say ... I talked about how appalling it is that children who adore him &amp; ...
@rudyamber This clip with the strange woman, with what was clearly a blunt and coke ... where on earth do you say I gave him a pass. I said when he was freaking out on the sidelines 2 years ago, proposing to the net, or his dumb celebrations was youth ... THIS is stupidity. I SAID THAT! ...
@rudyamber Did you not listen to me. I did NOT give him a pass. Play it back. I said it would be irresponsible if the Giants gave him a contract. I said to trade him for picks. I said Pat Shurmur gave him a clean slated, &amp; I was pleased he did commercial with Eli &amp; then he ends up in ...

@EBS9291 @fox5ny Yesssss. 88-77
Garden is getting feisty (in a great, #NewYork kinda way). #sjubb up 84-73 w 1:30 to go. Definitely not as many Ewing #33 jerseys in seats as I expected. If Home team holds on Johnnies get to face #1 seed #Xavier at noon. I’ll be back at Garden 6 AM for @fox5ny #GDNY reports!
Now let’s talk @StJohnsBBall ... #SJUBB extends lead to 67-59 w 9:13 to go on a great move to the hoop by Justin Simon (who had a sick dunk in first half to take lead). Here’s a few tidbits from Simon when I talked to him end of Jan. #BIGEASTtourney https://t.co/z9G3X9t5Gn
#SJUBB leads 58-57. But hard not to be impressed by #Georgetown C @JessieGovan ... 24 pts and 6 reb so far. Here’s intell from when I was at @Georgetown &amp; chatted w @CoachEwing33 &amp; Govan 2 weeks ago. #BIGEASTtourney https://t.co/7Iv4g9PCPo

@PhillyWCWagon @Kim_Adams1 @fox5ny Xavier won 9 straight after first loss to Nova. 2 of their 3 Conf losses are Nova. You hope they meet in Conf finals, but I think another team could absolutely sneak in there.
@Kim_Adams1 I hope Desi is back from this little sprain so Seton Hall is full strength. Meanwhile have you seen my mentions and the Nova fans appalled I said Xavier is strong?! They’re 4th in the nation ... but they suck. 🤣
@NovaEightySix @Kim_Adams1 @fox5ny They find ways to win. And both times Nova crushes them, Mack changed things. The way they switch &amp; how plays are run when Bluiett is doubled. If his shot is off though, that is when the get in trouble.
@PhillyWCWagon @Kim_Adams1 @fox5ny It’s that teams have figured out how to beat them...Xavier has improved a lot since those losses too. They made adjustments &amp; losses may have actually made them better. (I also talked to a scout &amp; BE coach&amp; both used that word in separate convos days apart &amp; BEFORE today’s loss.)
@Kim_Adams1 @fox5ny Can't wait! See you there!!!! What a season for Big East. (All my CBS Sports Net games were Big East Conf.) Meanwhile after what Creighton did today,  I'm also so curious to see what Providence can do. We know 'Nova's vulnerable, and Xavier is so strong. Who else now steps up?

With Frank Reich named head coach of #Colts, I have to say: #GoTerps ...The Backup QB conducted one of the great comebacks in football history. 1984 #UofMaryland down 31-0 at half v #Hurricanes, Reich comes off the bench leads #Terps to 42-40 win. AND-&gt; https://t.co/dvKZvaUcut

#Nets Kenny Atkinson knows there are positives but is disappointed how they get themselves into such big holes. 2nd half he Put Carroll back at 3 w Acy in, going big helped defensively. But in 2nd OT #Pelicans kept switching. Hard to score on that.

@rachiebret Thank you Rachel!! Let’s talk some women’s soccer on the tele again soon!
Carroll’s miss under basket, Dinwiddie foul on AD and Russell’s backcourt violation all in succession could cost Nets an incredible comeback. #hopenot #fox5nysports #livefrombarclays down3 w 30 seconds to go.
@Seth_Everett @DanBudick @JakeAsman @Delblogo Send me one. 😂🤣
The Nets have buried 18 threes so far. Trail #pelicans by 4 w 5 min left.   This marks the 1st time in franchise history that the Nets have knocked down 17+ 3-pointers in consecutive games. (According to #Nets PR)
Tweets have been overwhelming. Thank you all for your support. Like I said, I’m so thankful &amp; humbled. But time to tweet sports! #Nets are chipping away at #Pelicans 28pt Lead. Down to 5!

@FranTaylor117 Thank you Francine!! I appreciate you tuning in.
@Jpdabrams Thanks Jonathan. Hope you are well!!
@johnschuhmann Thanks, John! Now I have 2 NBA teams to cover. Heading to Nets tonight.
@GAK17 @WMUCSports I’m dead 😵 laughing 😂
@2reel4you Hey ... the women are reigning champs ... but yes, even they need to be paid more and given equal conditions.
@KendallAM Thank you Kendall. Really appreciate it.
@NathanBrice3000 I like that he can learn from the mistakes he saw.
@GAK17 OMGggggggggggggg was this at a @WMUCSports Christmas Party 😂🤣?????
@2reel4you I was surprised how the vote went. I was starting to think Carter was going to win. Any change should be good for the game though.
@NathanBrice3000 I thought there were other qualified candidates, but he is also well equipped. And yes. Will take a long time to right the ship.
@GAK17 Cheers to all my #terps reaching out. Thanks so much, Gregg. We’ve come ... decades. Lol 👵🏼

#Knicks GM Scott Perry says no time table or date of surgery set for Porzingis, but he believes he “will attack his rehab like he plays the game”.  Loss of KP doesn’t change approach to trade deadline...”we’re open to taking calls &amp; making deals.” https://t.co/qBtCLLedG9

#Knicks media availability following loss of Porzingis for season &amp; Hernangomez trade. What’s the plan now for season &amp; future? #fox5nysports https://t.co/1gtYahN6iZ
@RedsArmy_John It just always works out for the Celtics 😂🤣
#Knicks making moves.  Look like Hernangomez will not be getting those minutes in NY with Porzingis out ... he'll get them under Jordan and Co. Knicks loading up picks. Full rebuild on? #fox5nysports https://t.co/tsXObkFP9x
@WinstonMcGill2 @fox5ny @loristokes You have to build around stars. Porzingis was the first star in place to build around. Now there are no stars on this team. Yes, fans had hopes in the first player in place. one player.
@junebug3378 Thank you Kenneth! Enjoy your day as well!

Coming up on @fox5ny #GDNY ... more on #Knicks Porzingis ACL injury. Reaction around the league &amp; @loristokes was THERE! 8 O’clock hour, I’ll discuss recovery, impact on KP &amp; Knicks’ future. #sports #fox5ny
When I went to bed, reports &amp; video showed #Knicks Kristaps Porzingis walking &amp; putting weight on leg on way to hospital. Husband got home from work &amp; woke me: KP torn ACL in left knee. Out up to year. Horrible for NY’s All-Star. Feel bad for fans w/ so much hope in KP. 🙏🏼🦄
Nick Foles’ quote has inspired millions. When pairing it w video here... adds to the power of his words. ~ “Failure is a part of life. It's a part of building character &amp; growing. Without failure, who would you be? I wouldn't be up here if I hadn't fallen thousands of times.” https://t.co/z45llV0Fw1

Love how the attention the #NYGiants @nfl #SuperBowl commercial is getting, but there's big news deep within: Odell is healthy in his run before the lift &amp; at 37 Eli's arms &amp; base are strong. The 2 display a chemistry foreshadowing (as the commercial says) "touchdowns to come".😬 https://t.co/yyaj3ztFbU

@d03ham Thanks. And thank you so much for watching.
@mfmccart Thank you. Yes, FOX has Big East rights but they had another game at that time so CBS was able to take the Xavier game. I also did the XU at St. John’s game Tuesday night. 2-OH!

@StevenLacy Had an almond milk latte. Inquire for a review. ☕️
@bigant5432 @Babchik I live to make Babs proud.
@BradfatherSpeak At one point, had to stop and take notes on time codes for my package tonight. :)
@carisbrook5 Coach said draft answers were a team concern &amp; thy're still evaluating anyway. While he did say Eli is his QB, they will pick the best football player available when it's their turn to draft (that could also mean a massive trade to get a team giving away the farm to get a QB too)
Shurmur: On Odell’s personality.. “This is sort of a clean slate deal. We have to sit down and talk.”   Earlier on Odell’s talent: “Makes sense to throw him the football... will talk about what it means to be a football player for the #NYGiants”

You gotta love the 2-Network deal. It’s definitely a trend now in sports television. And can we discuss A-Rod’s post baseball career? Turning all the controversy he went through into broadcasting, business, media content, investing, fitness companies. It’s fascinating to watch. https://t.co/zGO7DU0ZDb
Pat Shurmur is #Giants HC. John Mara statement:“We are pleased to welcome Pat to our organization&amp;look forward to the leadership he will provide for our team,he has an outstanding track record in developing young players&amp;it's clear his players respond to his guidance&amp;direction."
@kristenvan @ScottDonig 🤣😂

I have officially watched this a couple dozen times now in last 12 hours or so. 😍🕺🏽👟 So swaggy adorbs.   How many times have you watched? 😂 #TavarisJones 💥 https://t.co/2xdedlDfgX
Great post @lindacohn!    Now I ask #Islanders Fans: do you exhale a sigh of relief? Or is there still concern about Tavares’ future on Long Island?? https://t.co/hxfnAB1rib
#Forgiveness is difficult, especially when ur life is changed by someone who hurts u. But as @JasonRomano teaches us in his new book #LiveToForgive about his personal experience w/his father, it’s possible! Can’t wait to read. Congratulations Jason!🙏🏼 https://t.co/cwZ7ld3LmF

@winston_mcgill @fox5ny BROOKLYN still has an #NBA team. He is the leader of ALL 5 boroughs.  Not respectful.
@bobbymckinley33 But as the leader of a city, you don't publicly diss a team. A professional team, that other big cities would DIE to have, like Seattle, trying to get back an NBA team, and this *borough* has one!
Good for the @BrooklynNets ! Stand your ground. #Respect #Pride #BrooklynGrit https://t.co/fXSbzcBUEH
Another busy morning in #sports on @fox5ny #GoodDayWakeUp #GDNY. Hear from new #Yankees manager Aaron Boone on delivering high expectations w/out managerial experience, #Giants Interim HC Steve Spagnuolo on his reax to firings &amp; #Eli on what went down in his meeting w Spags.
On Eli ... Spagnuolo said “he walked in my office ... as a coach you want every player to walk in your office with intent.” Says as D-Coord he stayed in his lane, but always felt, Eli should be starting. #GiantsPride
Spagnuolo says he hopes fans will know he’s trying to reunite and restore #Giants football. His focus isn’t on “trying out” to be next Head Coach, it’s on game this week.
Interim #Giants Head Coach Steve Spagnuolo announces “Eli Manning will be our quarterback”. Thanks Reese &amp; McAdoo for everything they did for him. https://t.co/Ta7IllHGiO

Thank you @ChrisCanty99 for joining @rosannascotto @loristokes &amp; me on the set at @fox5ny #GDNY to explain so much behind #Giantspride moves &amp; what they’re looking for in new coach &amp; GM. https://t.co/kIIBmhAcc3

@ram_rossman @fox5ny @ChrisCanty99 But they played last night and won!!  All 3 teams played last night.
Later this hour ... @ChrisCanty99 will join @rosannascotto @loristokes &amp; me on @fox5ny #GDNY set to talk about #Giants fallout following firings, Eli's future, QB Davis Webb's status, potential coaching &amp; GM candidates.
Lots going on in #NewYork #Sports I haven't event tweeted yet! On @fox5ny #GoodDayWakeUP &amp; #GDNY: #Yankees intro #AaronBoone today, #Giants have 1st media availability, all 3 #NHL teams in action, *** at 7:30AM @ChrisCanty99 IN STUDIO talking #Giants fallout &amp; future! Join us!
@gbaah3 @AsanteKotoko_SC So sorry for your loss, Gideon. Condolences ...
@BkRaysjoy @fox5ny Dude knows how to win. Right!?
@mjpaquin85 @bradfo @Bradfo_Sho It was actually quite grand. We were sitting under palm trees, by a pool in a luxurious resort as guys like Johnny Damon &amp; Barry Larkin were returning from golf, and we didn't want to talk to them. #toocool lol
@djamorelli @bradfo @Bradfo_Sho I've been married to my event coordinator (golf outings, corporate parties), photography company owning husband for 13 years.  Not all sideline reporters date players. 🙂🙃 And for my colleagues that do, or have married athletes, they are still great reporters and work hard.
@iamjoonlee Hey Joon!  Great meeting you as well.  Hope to see you around NYC soon!
@WinstonMcGill2 @fox5ny Thank you.
@WinstonMcGill2 @fox5ny Losing those two will really impact the Knicks.  Worried Hardaway Jr. may be out for an extended period.
@MongoGoesInsane @schott_john As someone who has always rooted against Michigan ... I wouldn't want him here. LOL But with media scrutiny and demands ... yup, doubt he would want to come. Qualified, sure. But don't think it's happening.
Now that Reese and McAdoo are gone, what's next for #GiantsPride???  ... we discuss all morning on @fox5ny... https://t.co/d5C8c1L3LK
Now that Reese and McAdoo are gone, what's next for #GiantsPride???  ... we discuss all morning on @fox5ny #GoodDayWakeUp #GDNY Plus, the #Islanders give us some good sports news.
@eileen7725 @rosannascotto @fox5ny You legitimately got your entire wish! Mara talked about a total overhaul in future.
Former #Giants players were reportedly planning on wearing No. 10 jerseys to this Sunday’s game. I know lots of fans there were DEFINITELY wearing Eli’s Jersey In support. Now ... they can all wear the jersey of a Starting QB. https://t.co/RdggCZNtae
Interesting numbers. #BenMcAdoo #JerryReese #giants https://t.co/uA9uQHQMK3
@DBYankees1 @fox5ny Great point as well. He could have stopped at saying he was grateful for the support of his coach.
Getting great replies from fans on this.  Lots of different reactions.  Good opinions. By the way ... who else just wants to talk about Giants Football again? (So much drama, we might have to just wait until draft.)😩 https://t.co/EfqQkDrMRL
@sportygamergeo @fox5ny LOL both work!!
@sportygamergeo @fox5ny @Giants “Super crap” well put
I've been playing the sound bite all morning on @fox5ny ... Who else was watching #giants post game LIVE when #GenoSmith went off on #RexRyan? My mouth dropped. I said "wait, he just went there?" And he DID, confirming w the quote "Rex Ryan". What was ur reax?
@danhausmann920 @DavidOrtizFund Glad you enjoyed.  It's a great cause by a great person! #bigpapi
Like a cat! #Fierce move! https://t.co/SF28h928u5
@Soaps247 @JennLahmers @fox5ny @sukanya @SamanthaAugeri @CaraDiFalco @lizdahlem @RobertMosesFox5 @KaylaMamelak Why wouldn't I be? lol Gotta get to work!
@mgm1973 Thanks Mike. I'm not sure if they make this move. If they don't, it can't get worse. Hate when people have to lose their jobs.  But it's a business where you are paid to win. Such a crazy year.
McAdoo Countdown Clock? When will it happen ... or maybe it won't?! What did Mara &amp; Tisch discuss in locker room? Filling-in for @DukeCastiglione this AM on @fox5ny I'll be on McAdoo watch with updates all morning.  #GiantsPride

Eli’s a class act. Winner. Did his job. Not his fault Giants have 3 starting WR injured &amp; O-line who can’t protect him or allow the run game to get past line of scrimmage. Silver lining:Eli’s safe &amp;healthy for next year’s NEW staff OR a team that respects hard work &amp; leadership.
