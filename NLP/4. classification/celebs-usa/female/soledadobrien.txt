@wes_chu Or “... what economics is?”. Or that in some schools “ec is short for economics”... or pretty much anything about anything that doesn’t involve bigotry, which I would posit he is quite good at.

This is a lie: https://t.co/rzophZfjmS
@whirrlpool Thoughts and prayers only (which is why it is in quotes) without action, is absurd. When someone tells you ‘thoughts and prayers’ that is not enough.
Even the Dalai Lama thinks ‘thoughts and prayers’ is absurd. https://t.co/2dur9VuY3k

My mother eating pie with her hands. Insanity.
Lol. I totally agree with this. One summer when I was a kid my mom and dad and I bought a warm fresh strawberry rhubarb pie and it was so good we sliced it with a comb (but ate it with our hands). We 3 ate the WHOLE THING. Was totally worth it. I had to wash the comb. https://t.co/OFGXb1ajI0

@AngryLibrarian Yes, on my feed, I am. Thank you and have a nice day.
@MrMattMelis It was a really terrible doc to shoot. That said, of the 3 people profiled—one did not survive. Two are doing really well. Got their lives back. Raising their young daughters. What a terrible fight though.
I did a doc where the woman we filmed shooting up heroin informed me she was a kindergarten teacher. https://t.co/bYhNIcbZli
This is correct. And Brian’s gymnastics to explain something that everyone fully understands as not journalistic—as no big deal. That’s probably the most pathetic part of this whole thing.

@JordanMaison Lol. On the other hand. I’m in to help. Sorry for the delay—dad’s funeral.
@sarahkendzior Exactly. Just want to underscore the difference.
@sarahkendzior Commentators do not direct editorial coverage. There’s a difference.

Ugh. Anonymous sources defending the hiring—and zero pushback from Brian when a source compares Isgur’s hire to anchors (who have no role in editorial coverage for the entire network). Very lame. I am actually embarrassed for Brian on this one. https://t.co/kH672jzPme
All the fake black people I am blocking today. Whew.

Also: apropos of nothing. I really enjoyed covering Bill Weld when I worked in Boston.  Very smart and thoughtful dude. Interesting to see how his entry into the race will change the discussion.
Just FYI: my @RealSportsHBO story this month (with Producer Maggie B) is amazing. I’ll have more details as we get closer, but whooo. It’s really good. And really tough. &lt;this is what we call a deep tease ❤️&gt;
@JayCaruso @Neoavatara Oh lordy. I like chatting w @Neoavatara because I think we are genuinely having a discussion.   We often disagree. We sometimes agree. You two carry on without me. I don’t need to circle this drain with ya.
@Fdr1942 @Neoavatara @GStephanopoulos I think he was hosting a show as a person who clearly came out of Dem politics. But he’s not an editor. And he’s not overseeing the political coverage for the network. But again—I sorta don’t care.
@Neoavatara I think they’d continue to be pissed that a journalist is not in the role of directing the editorial.
@Neoavatara See—we agree!
@Neoavatara Again—who is —directing—political coverage?
@Neoavatara I’m pretty sure ‘married to’ is not ‘leading political coverage from an editorial perspective’. So I’m not giving you that one. And listen—I think CNN is unfortunately painful to watch anyway. All those screaming pundits ugh.
@xeni Meh. Honestly I find them only slightly irritating.and it makes it easy to mute/block/unfollow.
@Neoavatara Who—Who has been an editor of coverage in some capacity?
@Neoavatara Meh. I think you’re intentionally misinterpreting that. I think the bigger issue is a non-journalist (not to mention person who is reported to have taken a loyalty oath to Pres Trump and whose twitter is laden with wacko conspiracies—) will help direct coverage. As an editor does

@cheggestad @jonnyspeech I guess I don’t understand why. She’s the Press Secretary. It is literally her job to be on television. Are you saying you think she should not be?
@cheggestad @jonnyspeech Zero interest in anything other than the fact that a person eho consistently lies to reporters is being interviewed by the Special Counsel’s Ofc.
Or: How you look when Mueller is asking you questions he already knows the answers to
@jonnyspeech I thought it was relevant since it’s about being grilled by mueller—
@The_Cantidates I don’t really get it—but it sounds like a threat.

This is a great example of a terrible way to frame a tweet, since the Presisent is lying in his statement. Do better @thehill https://t.co/3NSn7OEoLt
Suddenly the @nyt is totally cool with using “lying” in a headline. https://t.co/JGdHbCFEAH

“Trump is being Trump.”  And that, lady, is the problem right there. Don’t @ me. https://t.co/WZsopdkIvP
@JustinBettiWATM @brianstelter Yes, well the word ‘attitude’ doesn’t give one the sense that the journalists are just asking and she can answer—or not. (Which I fully support). It’s annoyance that her answer isn’t enough. Which, does in fact, make journalists seem kinda snitty about it.
This is a good and worthwhile read: https://t.co/L78qj2ej5S
Uh—he lied to Congress? https://t.co/fI3VroPUCY
@BeauCorrell Most folks can identify with lots of things simultaneously: I’m a mom, a wife, a small business owner, a reporter, a Long Islander, black, latina, female, American, New Yorker... you get the drift.
And she’s obviously angry: she tweeted, apologized, got a talking to, has been asked by (the very racist) President to resign, all via reporters who refuse to push this President in the same way. And I haven’t seen those reporters worried about his ‘attitude’
Um no. I read this as: my tweet and response speaks for itself. I think it’s demeaning to describe this as ‘attitude’.  Sounds pretty straightforward to me. https://t.co/loulGYYuSp
@BeauCorrell Not sure what ‘arising out of melanin’ means: but if you’re saying that most people see themselves as more than their race or color (or gender or ethnicity etc etc) then yes, of course. But that has not much to do with not seeing color. If you don’t see color, see an eye doctor.
Lol. Yes. This: https://t.co/2XvPkX2d5r

@Fdr1942 @AOC My tweet wasn’t even about the details of the Green New Deal. It’s about using @aoc, who I’ve met only once, as the face of irresponsible poverty AND American Elitism. Which seems, um... contradictory.
@KarenAttiah Thank you, love. We need to get drinks soon.
@RonWechsler Thank you. I appreciate that very much. My dad was awesome. I got to spend a lot of time with him in his last day.  I’m selfishly sad for me, but I’m glad his struggle is over. ❤️
@RonWechsler No. I am following you and we don’t disagree. And yes twitter is horrible for nuance.
@RonWechsler Ah—but with a few exceptions (and prob very very few on tv) the journalists understand: I’ll get more facetime/fame/access frankly to this helping-you-sell-your-book President if I don’t cover complex boring shit (injustice in voting) and I can get a  good line from Shultz.
@RonWechsler Grt example. Why is there not daily reporting on that? Why not constant, consistent, unending question about it. (Hate to use Clinton’s emails as an example, but hey, let’s). I would guess interms of #s of articles there’s been more written about the Trump voter than his taxes.
@RonWechsler I do not disagree that there are examples of excellence. But—if they don’t get clicks—and often if the topic is complex and not sexy, it won’t—it. Just. Goes. Away.
(‘I know we mocked @aoc for wearing an expensive-looking suit, and cause she couldn’t afford an apt in DC, but she is America’s Elite now’) https://t.co/FphChQNKjJ
Many pundits yawned. The press flogged whatever drama they could find. And moved on. With a handful of noteable exceptions—that’s just a fact. https://t.co/GwAXd3uMzs
Meh. Not really. The press covered it with vigor equal to how they covered the “Dean Scream” or anything @aoc did/does.  Then they move on. Fast. So no, @waltshaub is correct. The media likes a simple story that requires no context and is mired in both-sides-isms. https://t.co/6sk9HNFWNM

@zpleat He died last week. It’s just nice to hear his voice again.
Welllll—I just found a bunch of voice memos of my dad that I recorded about a year ago. I’m pretty pysched about THAT.
@JerylBier @Neoavatara Lol. Trust me on this one.
@Neoavatara @JerylBier Here’s what’s changed: you get more tv face time if you’re willing to go on tv as a supporter of President Trump. That’s what he’s looking for: tv bookings.

@ClydeHaberman @CNN Sorry for the typos. I can’t really see without my glasses.
@ClydeHaberman @CNN Alao—how can a lady writing about truth and accuracy in journalism have so many errors, omissions and copies and say—‘meh, my bad. And vice was out to get me’, as she’s interviewed. I’m utterly perplexed about that. Gotta tell ya.
@ClydeHaberman @CNN Because it’s marketsble. It will get eyeballs.  I find it so depressing bc I love journalism, but lately much is terrible. I don’t really know what to do. I tey to provide online assessment, but maybe that’s a waste too.
@ClydeHaberman @CNN Oh. Yes. I think yes. But I’ve been in conversations where the sales team raves about their ad revenue. It really is all about the money.
@HoarseWisperer They’re tougher than us. I was just shooting a story on a lake in MN, and trust me, they are.

@AprilDRyan Thank you ❤️

@Neoavatara Yeah I know.
@Fdr1942 @Neoavatara There’s a big difference between ‘how you poll’ and ‘what’s the right thing to do’. That said, I recognize this is where we are as a country. It’s why our reporters our often lame when it comes to interviews and our politicians say and do bad things and keep on moving. I get it.
@Neoavatara I know a lot of stupid racists.
This is great. https://t.co/aTsmIieDhe
@Neoavatara Yup. That was me. I guess I was holding onto the idea that taking responsibility for past actions and mistakes was a thing in govt. Maybe we should stop questioning why people have lost faith in political leadership.

Mostly I feel sorry for people who didn’t get to know my dad. He was a great human being. Love you, Dad. Rest In Power. ❤️❤️
I already miss him terribly. And I’m grateful for all the folks who moved heaven and earth so I could fly home last night and be there as he took his last breath (looking at all the awesome people at MOSAIC and the @ATLHawks!❤️❤️).
He was brilliant—a star rugby player in his youth (in Australia) he came to the US on a Fullbright and ended up focusing on fluid dynamics and fractals. But mostly he was an awesome dad. Here we are a few months ago, going out to get lunch in nyc. https://t.co/CD6jOCJi9G
He was a generous and kind human being—and a quiet force fighting for civil rights. His marriage to my mom in ‘58 was illegal (she’s black). They were married 59 years. Here he is walking me down the aisle in ‘95. (His twin brother said our wedding mass). https://t.co/MFpQOo0ibp

So, I really would one day like to be more like Ms. Kayyem (minus the security credentials—I’m good with my gig!). But I want other people to know journalists could do better and be better if they wanted to.
At reporters who refuse to figure out how to best interview a President who is a chronic liar (hint: letting him ramble gets some good soundbites but doesn’t actually force him to analyze his comments.
Ms. Kayyem (whom I do not know) is so thoughtful and organized in her argument and response—it reallly is breathtaking. I wish I could be more like that. But I am truly furious—at journalists who let racists and racism slide unchallenged, and crappy both-sides reporting.
This is amazing and worth reading https://t.co/IJoEagt1qh

Fun night hanging out with the twitter historians @KevinMKruse and @julianzelizer to discuss their new book: Fault Lines. Which looks out how fractured America has become since 1974. They’re even better in real life! Plus we took this selfie! https://t.co/2RGtf8K3Bk

Chuck Todd with the absurd “in his heart—you believe he’s (the President) is a racist?”  As I often say—reporters do gymnastics to avoid saying the very obvious and consistently observed thing. On this topic the media fails constantly. https://t.co/Umjqds6IGG

@Mark4124NH @MattWolking @timkaine @MarkWarner Nah matt is mischaracterizing it. But they did not call on him to resign.
@MattWolking @timkaine @MarkWarner Ah but I see why Matt would spin it that way.
I think this is an inaccurate take. I think “standing by” isn’t an accurate way to describe it—but they’re non-committal on his resignation. https://t.co/k41EGn3IxK
@Ron_Christie Oh I agree. But that’s my call for when the tearful presser announcing he’s stepping down happens.

@PamEyeAm Yeah—maybe skip twitter today, babe.
This was one of the most interesting and telling moments of the campaign for me (and btw I predicted early Trump would win: Lawn signs in my suburban NY neighborhood). Also—I never underestimate the appeal of racism to large parts of the voting public. https://t.co/mqPCa0vHnO

@Neoavatara Yes, slurs roll off his tongue easily. “It’s who he is” just means—‘we all know he’s a bigot and we’re cool with it.’  And that bigotry encourages others (for ex: Chaffetz gets there’s a slur there, and he’s not the sharpest tack, so he repeats it)
@Neoavatara He’s bigoted with his comments. And those who support him are cool with a bigot. Just to clarify.
@Neoavatara We agree. And the President is a bigot so not shockibg there. But I was just a little stunned by the Pocahontas slur. Who were the other Republican leaders who went with it? Chaffetz. Don jr. Who else?  So. Overt. Yes?
@Neoavatara I think lots of people—regardless of political affiliation thought it was stupid—but the bigoted comments from Republicans (Trump/whatsisface former Congressman from Utah/others) was very revealing in my view.
@maddezmom @SenSherrodBrown Nope. I’m a fan of his. And his wife. But it’s a code—like “real Americans” and it will sink you among people of color.
@CeeJayDubois Thank you. ❤️❤️. My favorite compliment from natives there: “you’re from here, right?”

@DavidJollyFL Lol. Let me know when General Washington is back in and I’ll reconsider.

@ReaganBattalion Sigh. Again: an expert—not a lawmaker—would be better. In my opinion. Can’t be more clear than that. But since you’ve moved into mean-tweeting: adios.
@Toddkron @BurgosGOP @marcorubio @MeetThePress And I keep telling you there are other policy experts—who are not lawmakers—who would be better. You’re welcome to not agree with me. I don’t know how to say this politely: I don’t care how you feel about it. Hope you have a great evening.
@Toddkron @BurgosGOP @marcorubio @MeetThePress Anyway. You don’t have to agree with me. Nice chatting with you
@Toddkron @BurgosGOP @marcorubio @MeetThePress Answeing as many tweets as I can. As I’ve said—I’d prefer an expert to a lawmaker. That said I prefer Rubio to Hewitt. But, looow bar.
@Toddkron @BurgosGOP @marcorubio @MeetThePress I think an expert who is not a lawmaker would be better. And certainly Rubio is better than Hewitt, but—seriously low bar.
@BurgosGOP @marcorubio @MeetThePress Not moving the goal post at all. I’m glad they had him on.
@Neoavatara If someone said to me (in an interview) “I don’t want a brown grandbaby”—well that would be the START of the interview.   Ugh. Disappointing.
@BurgosGOP @marcorubio @MeetThePress Uh. Marco Rubio is not the best policy expert in the US.
Not since George Washington has a non-major party candidate won the election. Many predict your candidacy would draw votes from whatever Dem emerges in the primary and your candidacy would hand victory to Donald Trump in 2020. https://t.co/gmrDQYL0ES
@Neoavatara I like Tom. Respect him. So I don’t think my comments are dragging anyone. But for 31 years I’ve been trying to increase the voices and perspectives on tv news. And, it feels like nothing has changed sine my first day at WBZ TV in 1988. It’s exhausting. And I’m tired of it.

You have Hugh talking about Venezuela. Tom talking about Latino assimilation. Not areas of expertise for either. How ‘bout some actual Latinos who are knowledgeable on the issues to discuss? https://t.co/TZ9RWRjjbK
@erikhinton Also: data shows the next gen Latinos are bilingual, the following gen Latinos speak English. *sigh*.
@francie_berens Oh of course. But there’s a persistent myth that Latinos don’t assimilate language-wise. There’s lots of data that points out how untrue that is. My story typical. Abuelita spoke probably two words of English. My mom bi-lingual. Me: sucky at Espanol.
@francie_berens “Make sure that all their kids are learning English”. Data would say they do. They’re very assimilated by the next generation. In fact,  they barely speak Spanish by the following generation! So the sense of not teaching their kids English is not supported by data.
@EatWithNia Yup. Me too. Cuban mom encouraged us NOT to speak Spanish at home. So I’m not bilingual and I regret it.
@francie_berens He is. And them he says he personally would like to see more assimilation. Lots of data shows that after a generation or two, Latinos no longer speak Spanish—they’re overwhelmingly English dominant.
@sovereignann He was arrested Friday. So he’s not even making sense.
Spanish dominance goes down for 2nd and 3rd generation Latinos. 61% of Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. are Spanish dominant (32% are bilingual), it drops to 6% among second-generation Hispanics and to less than 1% among third or higher generation Hispanics. https://t.co/gfdOPhoGIc

@Lollardfish @DeanObeidallah “As diverse as America” is the tagline to my show @matteroffacttv !
@DeanObeidallah But it show exactly how he feels about diversity and inclusion. Again—reminds me of my news directors of long-ago. They don’t actually think it’s valuable. They check a box, wink-wink. When he speaks about race he reveals this—frequently. And he’s old enough to know and do better
@DeanObeidallah ... that you are very ‘assimilated’ and can blend in and that you’re diversity ‘won’t be a problem’ bevause most new sirecyors are obsessed with their white audience. So the idea that any setious candidate would say “Pick me, Because I’m Female” is. insane.   2/
@DeanObeidallah Also: his comments remind me of old bosses I’ve had early in my career. They imagine diverse people are saying this: hire me to anchor your newscast cause I’m black! When the reality is—if you’re a diverse person in journalism (and natl politics) you do gymnastics to show...1/

@jodipicoult Also: they’re crazy and ignorable. Kids—seemingly no supervision. Also clearly disrespectful to native American elder.   Hero: Nathan who physically put himself in the middle of a risky situation.   It’s all in the nearly 2hr video.
@jodipicoult Kids start chanting and tomahawk chopping. One kid—with the shit eating grin—gets in his face. It’s all on a nearly two hour version that I’m sure is on youtube by now.   Black Israelites: obnoxious and nasty (as per usual if you’ve ever had them set upon you in nyc).
@jodipicoult At one point they call the lone black kid the N-word. A white man with the group, responds. “We got another one. He’s not here today”. (Nice)   As per his version Nathan moves forward in to position himself between the boys and the Israelites hurling insults.
@jodipicoult The Black Israelites are a creepy cult who spew vitriol at everyone. Video shows them (approx 5) calling the Native Americans “savages” and more at the start of their interaction. The boys move closer and closer to engaging with them. Where are the chaperones?

@matsmom @KrisColvin @speechboy71 The video I watched runs approx 2hrs. There seem to be adults (chaperones?) in the crowd. But I had the same question—the cred was massive abd the tone was bad—why didn’t they act?
@KrisColvin @speechboy71 Crowd is giant. I counted 3 of the Israelites—could be five. Dozens and dozens of kids. Adults seem to be the group. This nearly 2hr long video is consistent with interview Nathan Phillips gave.
@KrisColvin @speechboy71 At one point the Israelites call one black kid the n-word. (Approx 1:18) Person from school group responds “We got another one at home. He ain’t here”. Israelite responds: “so who’s the racist?”
@KrisColvin @speechboy71 Yup. This matches the full video I’ve seen. Interestingly—at 1:10 in the video—a grown man with the kids takes his sweatshirt and shirt off—and flails. who is he?  The kids move closer and closer to the Israelites—who tell them to back up. They start far away. The move close.
@notcharchar Again: a joke.

@CelesteHeadlee Exactly.
@jamesjgutierrez Tuition is just under 10k per kid. I’d guess 20 kids involved (from the video). So I’m going to say nope. Most won’t be ousted.
What morning show books the Covington teens (and their moms?). Do they ask for forgiveness or tearfully explain “It’s not what it looked like in the video”? Do school admins really oust a dozen kids from a school that only has a few hundred?
@blakegober @BriHot Please remove me from this conversation. Thank you.
@Gluonsrule @USATODAY I love journalists and journalism. But the reluctance—and gymnastics—that some journalists go through to couch stories about overt harrassment and racism is chronically disappointing. They chanted “Build that wall” to a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial. Wtf??

Hello, Mr. Racist. https://t.co/Q331jULfJn
This is so true—Presidential debates as entertainment. Casting, positioning on the set, creating a storyline, what’s the best soundbite?, who won the debate?, who ‘seems’ Presidential? What’s she wearing? Is ahe likeable? So little on content and info. https://t.co/ltgHDxg11c
Notorious white supremacist site. https://t.co/vDar7nN0ou
Are we still talking about economically insecure Teump voters? Or can we now just shift into racism and bigotry as motivators for some voters, since the President is retweeting a white supremacist publication?
The parody accounts are funny, the real tweets quote racists and white supremacists. https://t.co/xwTwL9FVNM
Yes, you are correct. But don’t worry—no one in his party will stand up or speak out against his appalling and bigoted actions because they are pathetic and afraid. (@marcorubio might quote something from the bible, though.) https://t.co/GE7Kzcltzt

As I told y’all: Romney is Jeff Flake 2.0. This one is an easy call and @MittRomney can’t even stand up for what is clearly morally—and legally—the right thing to say or do. It’s truly pathetic. @MaxBoot —what say you? https://t.co/Dw62oLeFVf

@dandrezner A strong folo-up would have helped.
@HispanicArts No one will interview actual people who live in the actual border. Shoulda added that.
@nofaith313 I survived!
@nofaith313 Yes! What could be more career-rewarding than covering a mostly-incoherent elected official who lies chronically and consistently, for a chunk of time past my bedtime?
@DougCarel Possible. I will capitulate to that.
Even if it’s lies: the big question will be: how was the delivery? Did he seem Presidential (and likeable?). They will drag a short speech into the 10p hour where it will lead the 10 and 11p shows. No immigration experts will appear. Few or no Latinos. That’s my prediction.  3/
Then there will be the post-game. Again: political pundits, not immigtation experts. It will be framed as yes wall/no wall. Oh, everybody will be white—including the anchors. Much of the conversation will center on “how the President did”, and less on the content. 2/
Here’s my prediction: CNN will open with a big, dramatic animated graphic. With music. There will be a pre-game: talking head panelists talking about the wall. It will not include experts on immigration.  The President will speak. There will be no timely fact check. 1/ https://t.co/My2xcPzDKC

@GroverNorquist Lol not censorship. Seems unwise to book someone who is confused about marginal tax rates AND slavery! Have a great night!
@SWagnerDO @Meerkitty771 @mbreg @realDonaldTrump No, I think the argument is—cursing isn’t particularly useful but feel free to ignore the hypocrites who call you out, since they seem to ignore the President’s foul language—and foul behavior.
Great dress!!  (And he looks nice too.) https://t.co/tCcfJvcBN2
@matthewjdowd I call out lots of people. This is not a left or right issue. Apologizing for cursing is silly. Especially considering how much the President himself uses foul language. The coverage on this is overkill—
@charlietodd @joanwalsh @Two_Beers_In I accept.
@johnbrougher The financial model does not support positive change coming anytime soon.
@cenkuygur I haven’t seen polling that huge swaths of dem voters dislike her (hilariously, GOP voters were polled but um, who cares). In fact, she seems quite effective. And the media is quite misogynistic—so I think you’re off about that. Lots of love back at you and happy New Year.
As we’ve been saying. https://t.co/v7ivhY0zR5

@haroldpollack @Neoavatara He will never, ever do that. My money is on Romney becoming Flake 2.0. Much handwringing. Little action.

@Fdr1942 @politico I think the challenge—and mistake—in this strategy “we don’t think she unlikeable—but does America” is that it reinforces stereotypes. There are a million better ways to do it. And it tends to only happen with women.

@KatMcKinley Just honest. The role of the legislative branch is oversight. The GOP and specifically @SpeakerRyan failed on this front. He loved to claim a moral high ground—but was too fearful to call out racism and bigotry in his own party. These are the facts, ma’am. I don’t sugarcoat.

So yeah—the Marquetti y Mendietas and O’Briens don’t want him on our family tree. (And trust me, we have a very spotty family tree).
Alas—it was not to be. He ends his tenure failing at the main agenda he had—by expanding our nation’s debt. He also failed at his multiple opportunities to call our his party’s bigotry and overt racism (looking at you @SteveKingIA). His legacy is failure.  And cowardice.
Instead, I tell him, now that he’s aware he comes from a diverse family tree maybe he’ll do a better representing the interests of a wider swath of diverse people. That, in fact, this information makes me more hopeful that he’ll think about his legacy to a broader constituency.
He has just had his dna tested and I guess he’s been informed that we are related. He says he thinks that I might be mortified by this information. (Had he seen my Finding Your Roots segment on PBS he’d know I have some very sketchy cousins). I tell him, I am not mortified—at all
The Speaker eventually hops on the phone—and it’s him. He has a pretty recognizable voice. He is very friendly even though I tend to call him out on twitter. A lot. He informs me that we are in fact related. Cousins in some way. (I THINK thru my mom’s afro Cuban side).
@matteroffacttv doesn’t focus too much on political talking heads. They’re often, um, not super honest so we keep them to a minimum and report on actual people across the country. (It’s why out ratings are very good. No joke). Anyhoo. I take the call. But I think it’s a prank.
So: my @SpeakerRyan story this morning. Takes place this past summer. I was driving into work when I get a call from one of his staffers that he is trying to reach me. I assume this is a prank bc the few times I’ve tried to book the Speaker for @matteroffacttv : crickets.

@Fdr1942 @NateSilver538 Remember—part of the reason corporations are focused on values is to appeal to customers and to their workforce. Customers want to believe advertisers have some kind of corporate social responsibility. Employees too. You cannot underwrite a bigot and claim to be against bigotry.
@Fdr1942 @NateSilver538 Slippery slope argument is bullsh*t. If corporations say they don’t support support racism and bigotry—they should prove it. To their customers and their employees. If they hold their values dear—then prove it.
Utterly and totally wrong, @NateSilver538. Advertisers tell their customers and employees they stand for something. That they hold meaningful values. Maybe the political message of racism is irrelevant to you, but hopefully organizations that say they stand for something, mean it https://t.co/TTNBFzzXNP

@HillAdvocate Bye!
Lol. Everyone is well aware what the Republican Party is all about. Your colleagues’ silence when it comes to bigotry, racism, out-and-out lying and hateful rhetoric speaks volumes. https://t.co/j5jRyRylRa
@TheTJHelm Nah. I don’t care about his hair or Melania’s hair color or breasts. I care about calling out racism and bigotry. And think reporters should too.
Would have been better if he’d been called out for his obviously false choice: “you can help the working class or promote illegal immigration.” https://t.co/GrT5rxSixa
@beastiegirl1969 Pretty good— working hard at it and (I sound REALLY OLD) compression socks while flying and riding are amazing.

@Chris_Cheetham @FLOTUS I wake up really pissed off at the racists who currently feel emboldened in this country abd the lackeys who support and coddle them. I’m happy to call bigots out on their BS.
@sindad1 Will do as I do every weekend!
Looks exactly like that. https://t.co/r66bt0Ne7B
I’m on my iphone, at my weekend house, about to head to the barn to ride my horses. The first lady’s birther views are despicable and racist and as an elected official you should be decrying them. https://t.co/fNg9NGxI7S
Lady—I get you’re her spokesperson, so you have to spin, hard, every day. But your boss @Flotus is a birther. Let’s chat about that first. https://t.co/z5HgQU0JWt
This is an interesting thread: https://t.co/LFR0dWKBRL
Whoo hoo!! https://t.co/yaG6Yd7uCj
Why were reporters so willing to believe him—why so eager to give him the benefit of the doubt, even when he didn’t do what he was spouting and the ‘wonkiness’ was shown to be a cheap facade. Was it as @MSignorile says—‘it was like looking in the mirror’ for reporters? https://t.co/DycAN9df45
@Lollardfish @LMegaparsec @InSpiteOfTrump @ianthescian @Twitter I heard he’s got a band

@ianthescian @Lollardfish It’s why I stay here:  mostly a cesspool, but then Charles Barkley and the cat litter scientist and discovering a new band—2 dudes singing Spiderman—and I fall in love with @twitter in spite of myself ❤️

Hopefully others will follow. Many prominent brands highlight their commitment to diversity and inclusion, and yet underwrite the bigoted crap Tucker Carlson spews nightly. I’m curious what other brands advertise on his show? https://t.co/RWbcx6OK0b

@jayrosen_nyu @MSignorile He’s able to imagine it: his quote is “they sent her to come after me”.   These are the same folks who will tell you they could never spent 40 mins reporting on child poverty. Or the lack of affordable housing. Or homelessness.
Utter waste of time. “They sent her to come after me” is the telling quote. For CNN it’s not about educating the public, or making sure facts and truth are elevated. It’s about wrestling in the mud, to give a sense of urgency and drama. It’s really, really sad. https://t.co/D2GTmuN5VX

Oop. https://t.co/NlrPAz6FUo
@DMRDynamics @Xaron4 @SpeakerRyan Newsroom conversations (when I anchored a morning show ten million years ago) were always framed around his ‘wonkiness’ and his ‘policy genius’. Why push that mythology when it was pretty quickly clear ‘nah, he’s not’
Oooh. I know! Pick me! Pick me! https://t.co/MHwVy4wBYX
@paulkrugman Why did news orgs buy it? In part bc he ‘looked the part’.
@SpeakerRyan long has this mythology of being a ‘policy wonk’—and the media embraced it and perpetuated it, even when it was found to be really, really wrong. Reporters did all kinds of gymnastics to try to elevate that narrative, instead of acknowledge the obvious: He’s. Not. https://t.co/uN7PwiVkgp
