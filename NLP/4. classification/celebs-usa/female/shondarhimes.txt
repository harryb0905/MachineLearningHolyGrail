And most importantly, they empower students to affect change.
They provide appropriate development resources for educators to use.
From Congress to the Department of Education to school hallways, they conduct extensive and original research to improve school climate and champion LGBTQ issues in K-12 education.
More info about @GLSEN:  GLSEN was founded in 1990 by a group of teachers in Massachusetts to improve the way LGBTQ students were being treated in the education system.
Looking forward to presenting @EllenPompeo with the Inspiration Award at the 2018 @GLSEN Respect Awards. Our Ellen has never silenced herself for ANYONE. She stands up and speaks up and works to be a champion for others. It‚Äôs an honor to call her a friend. Congrats, Ellen! https://t.co/Soj1toSkAn
