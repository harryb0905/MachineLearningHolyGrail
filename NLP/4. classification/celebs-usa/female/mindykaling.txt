This weekend was crazy. I’m overwhelmed by all your support and excitement for #LateNightTheMovie. It’s taken years and years of working alone on it, uncertain it would ever be seen. So, yeah, my heart is about to explode. Thank you.
@davidstassen 👎🏾
It’s true. The legend Diane Warren wrote a song for #LateNightTheMovie that is so catchy and empowering, I listen to it constantly. You will be singing it for days after. Can’t wait for you to hear! 💃🏻🎶 https://t.co/YbpnJfg5Ql

I love this woman. From movie star to Holly Flax to seeing her onstage, she is the absolute best. I was so happy when she agreed to be in Late Night.

@rianjohnson So excited!!
5) no one told me that Crazy Rich Asians would also carry a powerful statement about single moms and their bonds with their daughters. I was bawling. Crazy Ugly Crying From Me 🤦🏾‍♀️
4) not to be tacky but it felt so good to be immersed in so much Asian attractiveness. Even more than the tiny waists and 8 packs (which was super impressive), there was so many beautiful happy Asian couples. I loved it. 🙌🏾
3) the fashion was off the chain, and there was even a MAKEOVER MONTAGE that @awkwafina hosted! Each character was so clearly defined, sartorially. Feast for the eyes for this costume nerd! 💃🏻
2) perfect wish fulfillment sights and sounds of beautiful Singapore. So great to see a non-European setting for love to unfold. Can they do a “sex and the city” style bus tour in Singapore? I would go! 😍
1) Constance was revelatory. Such a superstar, so warm and vulnerable. And AN ECON PROFESSOR romantic comedy lead! Bye cupcake bakery art dealer blahdee blah girl

@ikebarinholtz @KingJames Great question. I think he would’ve laughed but ultimately thought it was foolishness.
