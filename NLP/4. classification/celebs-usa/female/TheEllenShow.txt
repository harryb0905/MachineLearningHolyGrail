.@VinDiesel, if you‚Äôd ever like to challenge Mark to a pie eating contest on my show, you know how to reach me. #GameofGames #KnowOrGo
P.S. Remind me to never eat the pie at Mark‚Äôs house. Who droppin‚Äô? You droppin‚Äô! #GameofGames #KnowOrGo
OMG. MARK! I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing when we taped it. And @portiaderossi &amp; I can‚Äôt stop laughing now. #GameofGames #KnoworGo
East Coast- this episode is new but the watch-along puzzle in my app is a repeat. Oopsies. Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll still pick a winner.
She was thinking, ‚ÄúHow do you like them Apples?‚Äù #GameofGames #AwSnap
QUICK COMMERCIAL GAME: What famous movie quote was going through Natasha‚Äôs head after she won? #GameofGames #AwSnap
Who do you think is gonna win? Natasha is used to getting things done while people pull at her, but Jaimee‚Äôs probably used to dragging people out of a bar. #GameofGames #AwSnap
I hope you‚Äôre watching, (CAR)D(BEE). @iamcardib #GameofGames
I think even Margie was surprised she won. That was amazing! #GameofGames #MtSaintEllen
That round of #DangerWord was full of surprises, but not even close to the surprise that Mark has in store for us with #KnoworGo. #StayTuned #GameOfGames
.@MelissaMcCarthy the Academy just called and they‚Äôd like to give you another nomination for your #DangerWord performance. You are tonight‚Äôs winner! #GameOfGames
.@IMKristenBell ‚Äì How can you get the rap air horn to follow you around everywhere you go? Amazing. Best clue of the night. #GameofGames #DangerWord
Fun Fact: @PrattPrattPratt hung upside down for two hours to get that shot. Now, that was the best one. #GameOfGames
