Hey all, I know the Tweet will live on but have taken it down to move the focus to all I hope to accomplish on behalf of a great sport &amp; those who are dedicated to it
I regret the post and respect everyone’s views &amp; fundamental right to express them. This doesn’t reflect how I will approach my position @USAGym I will do everything I can to help build, w/ the community, an open, safe &amp; positive environment.

Very deeply concerned that the President didn’t even mention the opioid epidemic in his remarks to the GOP Conference. #opioidcrisis
Just realized that, if I don’t play golf, my handicap stays the same. If I do play golf, my handicap gets worse.  This is not good for my former-athlete ego.
@SlingshotDC Good story about the sorrow of the epidemic but still so short of a serious response.
It WAS a bipartisan speech tonight. What is wasn’t was a way for the Democrats to win back the hearts of the American people. #StateoftheUnion
@StuPolitics Seriously, you two are too jaded to see all that was happening tonight. Adore and respect you anyway.
Hey Twitter.... time to do some vetting and do away with bogus AstroTurf accounts. If you don’t, you risk freedom and democracy around the world. Seriously, if you just started tweeting with 5 followers tonight, you are an enemy of freedom &amp; humanity
Wow.   #crutches #Freedom #StateoftheUnion
Our national security is second to nothing in importance.... ISIS and Al Qaeda need to be defeated &amp; the “street” won over..... But we have lost more to opioids than to those bastards... Got it, short term v. long term.
I’m watching from home with @astro_oz and we both feel like standing many, many times during this @POTUS #StateoftheUnion
@jonathanvswan Thank you for highlighting this story. Powerful and gut-wrenching.
Hope!
God willing, in the end we will prevail.. but we need leadership. #Stateoftheunion #opioidcrisis
We must get must tougher on drug dealers... that includes Rx.... #StateoftheUnion
“23 million hearts are breaking for you”... @POTUS to loved ones grieving senseless tragedies, of which there are many... #StateoftheUnion
Yes! Let’s give people a second chance at life! Thank you @POTUS Time for sentencing guideline reforms.
The Democrats sit through a line about standing up for the National Anthem?  Can’t believe how hurtful that must have felt for our deployed troops overseas. #StateOftheUnion
The Democrats can’t even stand for the “In God We Trust” Line? Wow....
I’m so proud of many of my former colleagues sitting on the House floor right now.... Too many to name. But my heart also aches to see the bitterness and massive divide and disconnect between the two sides. America is better than this. #stateoftheunion

Bipartisan &amp; independent House Office of Ethics needs weight behind its purpose, i.e. subpoena power &amp; enforcement capabilities. Currently it only issues findings in secret to House Ethics Committee.
We no longer need to accept the culture of sexual harassment as a given. We’ve stopped confronting it and started to simply deal with it. Time to change that!

HRC is the most disciplined candidate I've ever seen on the screen. She is smart enough to avoid a Bernie/Dukakis/Bush moment. #debatenight
HRC is poised &amp; perfect. But the sound bites seem canned &amp; tested. Too perfect can become flawed. Authenticity is sacrificed. #debatenight

Someone asked me tonight why I support @JohnKasich This piece explains it better than I can:  I oppose Donald Trump https://t.co/4srPcuIikG
My hunch says that, in this presidential election, the partisan lines will dissolve &amp; the "voting blocks" will be unidentifiable. New era.
No.  https://t.co/LqhOXd9xOh

Hey #RxSummit participants! Can't wait to hear your thoughts on the POTUS panel. How do you rate it on a 1-10 scale?
Comparison by @DrLeanaWen of naloxone to Epipen is shallow thought. Proves she may not truly understand substance use disorder. #RxSummit
.@BarackObama at #RxSummit We still have a long way to go. Thankful we finally admit there's a problem. #RxSummit https://t.co/L9yhFTVPSw
7 years ago we hand delivered opioid epidemic issue to @BarackObama &amp; asked 4 help. I feel it was overlooked. Let's not politicize it now.
.@ONDCP Should EMTALA include recovery if patient needs it? Seems to be worth kicking around the idea.
.@BarackObama repeats sad fact; that more people are dying from opioid abuse than from car accidents #RxSummit @ONDCP
Opioid abuse has finally gotten the attention it needs so badly. Glad to see @BarackObama &amp; @ONDCP here #RxSummit https://t.co/XHDYfMPmkv

Wow.  Déjà vu. I think we've had this talk before.  https://t.co/gj4QUVEphv
Once again @JohnKasich giving the most upbeat messaging of the bunch. Which isn't saying much.
Marco! We get it! But please tell us, I implore you. Why are you better? You can win! Tell us why the country would be better off with you.
One of the most troubling statements out of Trump.  Chilling actually.  #GOPDebate  https://t.co/OyDi17K6WU

Not saying that &amp; not arguing gun control. Am arguing we are at war v terror. But this point is purely political.  https://t.co/IbusLIecGK
Keeping anyone who is on terrorist watch list from buying guns &amp; explosives makes sense. Someone being erroneously on it = weak argument.
