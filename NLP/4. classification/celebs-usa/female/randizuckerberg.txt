"I am really excited to see what new technologies stick with video. I think that when we look at how meaningful video chats are with family, I'd like to see that filter through the dating world!" @JulieSpira

"Cast a wide net. You have the opportunity now that your relationship doesn't have to be a zipcode-restricted love. Technology helps us!" @JulieSpira

"We so thrilled to be opening an online store in the coming months!" @CureThriftShop
"We are constantly exploring other verticals in the luxury space and expanding who we are working with. Our goal is to develop trust about buying any product that could be a counterfeit." @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"We list 40,000 items to sell each day. We have to be more efficient about listing and @Entrupty helps with that process."@shopgoodwill
"AI and blockchain will ultimately solve most of our problems. It is the future of our industry." #hula
"There is a certain quality when you touch the product, especially to experts, we know how the leather feels."  #Hula
"I look at the stitching, the labels, and the glue. A lot of the times, it's very evident that the piece is a fake. To the naked eye you can generally tell, if the design is uneven or there's extra glue." @CureThriftShop
"We realized that we need to have the data of what was real and not real 30 years ago. We had to self educate about who made what. Some information that we had to collect, not even employees knew. We spent close to 2 years collecting data from 1890s to 2019." @Entrupy  @Vidder911
"We have a feature on our website where people can buy verified goods or get their items checked for a small fee and get a authentic certificate." @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"We do a regular cleanse of our store. We believe that energy is poured into the items that are brought in. Sometimes that is why someone is attracted to the item at first glance." @CureThriftShop
"Vintage is cool. Now we have college students looking to recreate what they see online." @CureThriftShop
"There’s been a lot of challenges. I think with younger mindsets- prices will be the winner. They look at value." @CureThriftShop
"We did a campaign called Get Lucky. This term is when you feel lucky about getting and finding an item that has been worn by someone who has clearly had a wonderful lifestyle. If we nail the authentication, there will be more trust." #hula
"In Hong Kong especially, there is a notion that wearing preowned items that have touched the skin have absorbed unluckiness from the previous owner. This is why preowned handbags were the first item to skyrocket  and sell in Asia." #hula
"It's not about what customers know, it's about what they don't know." @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"For a counterfeiter, the incentive is maximum product for maximum value. AI gives our customers a greater peace of mind. I’m excited for AI." @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"It comes down to the basis of trust. Here’s a seller with 35 stars, but are they selling original goods?!" @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"We were researching on who counterfeiting was affecting. Was it the original brand, the market? We used to have a system called follow me home to catch counterfeit sellers." @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"We wanted to build a company because counterfeit is one of the world's oldest problems that you can’t ultimately prevent." @Entrupy / @Vidder911
"I’m the only one to price items. I search online about worth point. If I’m not sure I don’t put it out." @CureThriftShop
"I loved found items and started to find and sell on eBay. I’m able to give back to Type I Diabetes advocacy because of the success of my business." @CureThriftShop
"Our goal at @shopgoodwill is to extract the most from our donations to benefit the mission. We look through for accuracy. We let the market decide the price by their bids."
"The primary difference is search on @ShopGoodwill. We have approximate 300,000 items. We curate the items. We want to sell the most, so we can to turn the donations into mission dollars. As soon as the product goes online, you get an email notification!"
"We’ve opened a showroom because people in Hong Kong like the shopping experience. We also pay sellers around 65%!" #hula
"Hula is a luxury platform. I’m collecting from industry collectors. We are not like eBay. We keep our collection very curated." #hula
"In Hong Kong- there’s either very high luxury and then there’s low resale. There was really nothing in between." #hula
"I came from the perspective of knowing how to make a product and knowing how to market that product from the inside. I had total respect for the process." #hula
"I started to realize how much waste there was in the retail industry. From not only the retail side, but also from my friends and colleagues who would get bored of the trends. I started researching and there wasn't anything new and cool in Hong Kong centered in resale." #hula
Uber users can now hail helicopter ride to Coachella. Uber will even arrange an SUV for pick up and drop off. The service costs $4,170 for a charter and accommodates up to six people. Helicopter ride-sharing to Coachella—like or dislike?

"The Lincoln Institute is all about hospitality and what we can do for our customer." @Ford

My brothers taught me to stick in pencil in the ignition to start the car. I grew up in a Ford family with Ford trucks and my mother had a continental. After college, I interviewed with Ford and loved the people! The culture of the company is truly wonderful."@Ford

"It's okay to change. People may question you, but it shouldn't hold you back!" @AmyMorinLCSW
"Mentally strong women aren't afraid to reinvent themselves." @AmyMorinLCSW
"It's important to set boundaries. What are some emotional boundaries to eliminate relations with negative people? There is a notion that venting will make you feel better. It actually makes you feel worse." @AmyMorinLCSW
"Some people have daily goals. A lot of people have big goals and imagine the future as if it's real. It's not a cognitive thing, it's an imaginative thing. It's not just having the goal. It's feeling what it would feel like if you achieved it." @bulletproofexec
"Eat well and move a bit. Cut out sugar, grains, and bad fats and sleep!" @bulletproofexec
"When you'll say you'll try, you're lying. The power of the language you use in your inner voice, is so powerful. Say you'll do it and you will." @bulletproofexec
"There's a difference between ruminating and self-evaluation." @AmyMorinLCSW
"Mentally strong women don't compare themselves to other women!" @AmyMorinLCSW
"Making resolutions on New Year's Day is not necessarily the best answer. We should be conscious of our bad choices everyday!" @AmyMorinLCSW
"You should be aware of every single decision you make daily and then it's easier to change those choices." @bulletproofexec
"The number one most cited answer to changing your body is what you eat. The best goal is to stop doing things that make you weak. The reason that people fail at their resolutions is that they think it's binary. It's all about a scale." @bulletproofexec
"The things that make you strong are the things that require the most work." @bulletproofexec
"It's really about recognizing how our habits are counterintuitive. Mental strength is equivalent to physical strength. Eliminating your worst habit will make eliminating other bad habits so much easier." @AmyMorinLCSW
"I wanted to show that you can be a strong woman in today's world and I was thrilled to write a book specifically for women." @AmyMorinLCSW
"Being strong is not the same thing as acting tough. When you don't cry and block emotions, you're putting on a facade and a wall. Being strong is actually admitting weaknesses. You don't have to paste a smile on all the time." @AmyMorinLCSW
"I wrote a letter to myself of inspiration and then published it online to help other people. Then 50 million people read it!" @AmyMorinLCSW
“One major lesson I’ve learned- the power of saying no. You have 24 hours a day. Use those hours to create things you’re passionate about. Saying no is so powerful. It isn’t taught anywhere. If you’re doing things that exhaust you, stop doing those things!” @bulletproofexec
“I took my ego out of the loop. There are people on Bulletproof Radio that have taught me and I now use in my own practice.” @bulletproofexec
“Bulletpoint is a movement. It’s a community. Biohacking is a term that I’ve defined. We’ve created a movement of controlling our own biology. Every one wants a body that can do what they want and a mind that can do what they want!” @bulletproofexec
“I wrote a blog thinking 5 people would read it and then thousands of people read it.” @bulletproofexec
“I was a deep tech guy working on building an internet that connects the world. I’m really interested in hacking the human body and learning about meditation and self improvement!” @bulletproofexec

"You don’t get rich by buying gold. It just preserves what you already have." @roysebag
"If the government has to keep printing money, I need to own gold." @roysebag

"Bitcoin and Crypto really play into FOMO and they're easy to get caught up in. You have to look at how much money you’ll looking to allocate. Allocate it to gold to protect yourself later. Be careful investing in Bitcoin."@DanielaCambone

"It's about designing around the user journey based on user research." @floschaub
"Users rely on conventions. We expect that scrolling up and down and swiping left to right will automatically work. It's really about designing around the users and audience. We want to keep different perspectives in mind." @floschaub

"I work harder than I ever did in high school. I work 17-18 hours a day. I'm really not a normal teenager, but I'm treated like a normal teenager in meetings. Being a high school dropout is a double edged sword, because I have to deal with a lot more critique." @withastra

"Sit With US can also be used for adults! We marketed it for elementary and middle schools, but we've also noticed that it is used in graduate schools and in the workplace!" @nobodyeatsalone
"The app is a free lunch planning tool. It's a social network and you take a pledge that anyone who joins your table is welcome. There is always a full list of tables on the app, so people know which tables will be welcoming and there is no fear of rejection." @nobodyeatsalone
"I wanted to spread the message of how important simple acts of kindness are! So...I started the app Sit With Us." @NobodyEatsAlone

"70% of moms want to stay working, but only 40% remain in the workforce that first year after having a baby." @heymamaco

"Having a baby means that you learn a whole new skill set- juggling and balancing, and multitasking!" @heymamaco

"There’s a perception that moms are unfundable." @heymamaco
"All of these moms are overwhelmed with raising humans and being successful at work." @heymamaco

"We think the female tribal support system is so essential." @heymamaco

"I came to a point in my life after having a baby and I felt like I needed to make a difference in the world. Katya was my only mom friend and we decided to build our own community." @heymamaco

"Think about where you're working and see if the company's values are aligned with your own. Also focus on honoring relationships with others and yourself. Pause and think what is the best medium of communication to relay a problems." @Erica_Keswin
"Finding your passion and following it is essential." @mbrianaepler
"I want to build companies with leaders who are diverse right from the start." @mbrianaepler
"The best companies and leaders know when to pivot. You need to follow your passion. I want to change the world and that's what's driven me." @mbrianaepler
"We need to recognize and support people who need it. At Backstage Capital, we're looking at people who are underestimated. We really need to think about people who we traditionally call minorities." @mbrianaepler

"By age 6 or 7 our students can build their own video games." @vivianmshen

"Connecting is not rocket science." @Erica_Keswin
"By 2020 millennials will make up 50% of the workforce." @Erica_Keswin
"We need to curate connection in a curious way. At company events, there's a group of people who don't come and then a group who come, but are on their devices. Some companies are doing happy hours where the tables are turned and executives make the drinks!" @Erica_Keswin
"Only 11% of people are entirely satisfied with their work environments." @Erica_Keswin #bringyourhumantowork
Check out @Erica_Keswin's #spaghettiproject and her book #bringyourhumantowork

"It's about finding the sweet spot with tech and connect. If tech is the only way we connect with people, we get into trouble. It's about leveraging both. If you're at a meeting a work, connect on breaks. Find the moments of putting your phone away!" @Erica_Keswin
"In my book, I've developed a menu of options of what's relative for your company. I've always been a connector. I enjoy connecting people to ideas and each other. Left to our own devices (PUN) we're not making the connections." @Erica_Keswin
"Our classes focus on adequately getting practice in education. Only 4 out of 10 schools teach computer science and 9 in 10 parents want it to be provided. Not all kids need to be computer scientists, but having the option is always desired." @vivianmshen
"It took me a while to figure out the gender gap wasn't because of me. I had an aha moment when I realized we need to change the way we do business. We need to change tech." @mbrianaepler
"We provide classes that bring it back to the basics. Role modeling is incredibly important. We'll match a female student with a female role model. Adaptive tech is not as sophisticated as we'd like." @vivianmshen
Panasonic recently announced Wear Space, a wearable concentration device that’s said to help people focus by controlling their field of vision and adding noise-canceling headphones. Horse blinders for people, like or dislike?

"Everyone heard the word 'passive', we don't want a passive audience. Red and Facebook teamed up to use light-field tech so what you see is very much active." @GagsFilm
"We're right at the very edge of VR. Soon accessibility will be easy and cheap enough to allow everyone to watch. To have a Go camera for $200 is a big leap." @GagsFilm
"Access with VR was not a choice in my family because I grew up in a rural area. My family seeing me in NY performances was very difficult. VR makes it more accessible. It is an investment for a a brighter future in cultural entertainment." @Usbcompany
"I have experienced VR and was skeptical and then I actually tried it and was amazed. I don't have one personally, but there are cardboard sets for a $1 and you can experience it and they work well." @EricGersen
"VR is very cool if you haven't experienced it. Cardboard VR is a lo-fi version of it." @EricGersen
"I'd love to see a VR choose your own adventure horror films." @GagsFilm
"We started using VR for training, like CPR. We were wondering where we could put the camera to be the most valuable? We came up with a shoulder rig so it's from their POV, we can see real reactions." @GagsFilm
With the launch of Oculus Venues and other home-viewing virtual reality programming, VR live entertainment is gaining popularity and momentum. Tune in to hear me discuss with my guests VR home entertainment!

"Creating a show with a VR camera, you have the chance to incorporate a point of view format with the idea that the audience is a character in the space." @EricGersen
"The scale tipped with my excitement when I put on the VR set and experienced the show as an audience member. There is still a sense of community because when you you're looking, you can see who is beside you in the space." @ucbcomedy
"I like horror in movies, but what added another level of terror to watching it in VR was that you couldn't be active. You were paralyzed and couldn't move." @EricGersen
"VR brings a whole new element of terror to a film. When a horror film reaches its climax, VR put you right in the middle of the action." @GagsFilm
"At first I was worried I was going to miss something shooting in VR. I was used to the traditional way of filming." @GagsFilm
"We were looking to expand the @GagsFilm brand. In the year we were in post people were clamoring for more. The idea for 360VR came about."
"In corporate videos we were doing there was a mobile camera but there were always problems. I started using VR to capture the whole image and crop in post." — @GagsFilm
My fear was that watching a recording wouldn't have the same vibrancy as it does watching it LIVE. But with VR, audience members don't have that degree of separation. We want to make sure the VR audience feel included, and they do!" @ucbcomedy
"Right now with the VR, anyone can login and be part of the audience. There's an amazing way of seeing the space. The melodies, the music, the story, are made up each night!" @EricGersen
"It takes a while to feel comfortable to improv with a team." @ucbcomedy
An Amazon AI recruiter had to be scrapped because it was not rating candidates for software developer jobs in a gender-neutral way. Using patterns, the model taught itself that male applicants were preferable because most resumes came from men. Vetting AI tech- like or dislike?
Move over BlueBlockers, IRL glasses block TV and computer screens, limiting the amount of tech you take in. Based on the magic ad-blocking glasses in the cult classic, THEY LIVE, these glasses block UV rays, LCD and LED lights. Damn, I love these ScreenBlockers, like or dislike?
Due to an overwhelming public poop problem in San Francisco, a free app called SnapCrap allows people to take photographs of public feces and deliver the alert to the city’s Public Works Department.  Needing an app to clean up feces on sidewalks —like or dislike?

"The narcissism is a phase and I can't see it sticking around forever." @wstorr

"Nobody could’ve predicted what’s happening. What are the really good things in technology and what are the bad things? How can we harness the good things?" @wstorr
"There was a sunflower farm that had to close down because someone took a selfie there and thousands of people showed up and were wrecking the field." @wstorr
"Twitter is not a plot by evil geniuses, we've evolved it and made it what it is." @wstorr
"We find ourselves comparing ourselves to other people on social media. Not only to whole world but the most beautiful people. It's unconscious and affects you." @wstorr
"We always try to keep people who can see technology about 5 years ahead. Technology is not going away. We need means of control instead of technology controlling us" @eyebeamnyc @rddy
"We're in a dystopian moment with technology, but there are ways out." @eyebeamnyc @rddy
"To counter the downfalls we all recognize, we have to better educate ourselves. Tech isn't going away." @rddy
"Social media works because we're using our tribal communication skills. Those  skills motivate you to act and punish people. It's the tribal idea of throwing someone out of the tribe. We're in a contact state of anger. When we're angry we're irrational." @wstorr
"I still feel positive about the roles tech play in our lives." @rddy
"It's going to be hard to legislate our way out of social media. But we're in a constant state of anger. The genie is out of the bottle. It will be hard to fix." @wstorr
"Social media works using tribal psychology. We value connection and status." @wstorr
"I can't stop myself looking at the news or Twitter, but it makes me feel bad. It reminds me of having a drinking problem. It's a weird relationship. But I think it's a relationship that 90% of people have." @wstorr
"A lot of the time you see that it's just bringing people in conversation together. We want to make artists the center of these conversations. We want them to begin conversations with what we dream about and then let the Internet stem from that." @rddy / @eyebeamnyc
"We use the space for artists and technologists to come together. Currently we have an artist working with us looking at AI and the biases built in from the creators. She's particularly looking at African American communities." @rddy @eyebeamnyc
"We call it Silicon Roundabout in East London." @wstorr
"I think at some point that I made a decision that my role is to support visionaries and artists who are directly engaged with technology. There's a cross pollination  between art and technology. It's safe space from the winds of capitalism to explore." @rddy @eyebeamnyc
"We're launching an artist's re-imaging what the internet could be. We're doing that with dinner salons and working with early innovators of the internet." @eyebeamnyc @rddy
"Alumni have gone on to have business success and others who became artists with a capital A. We had the youngest artist to ever show at the @whitneymuseum. " @eyebeamnyc @rddy
"When you look at late 1980s, we were in a self esteem movement and were raising our children as special individuals. We're in a new phase now and it's leveling off in our narcissism." @wstorr
How self obsessed do you think we are as a society? Chime in!
"People get stuck in these crazy beliefs about technologies, but people do change their minds. People were asking me why do they change their minds and I didn't know how or why that happened. We internalize our culture and our culture defines who we are." @wstorr
"The West has always had a high level of self-obsession.... it had a massive acceleration in the 80s and we're still growing." @wstorr
"Technology shows us who we are already." —@wstorr

AI is everywhere right now: in our news feeds, our devices, our homes. The hype is spreading quickly to permeate every industry, and the executives of the world want to know about it. Tune into @jfgagne's new podcast Element AI: https://t.co/9EAhb0sdCS, https://t.co/J3DC7PXodo !
"Advice: Go and make sure you find the right data. Don't assume you have it until you prove it. The first thing to do is go out and seek the information you need to build your service. Your business plan needs to allow you to fail. You will need to discover and learn." @jfgagne
"Elderly are starting to interact with Alexa for companionship out of loneliness." @TheMan
If Alexa doesn't understand you, no one dies. If a self driving car doesn't understand you, people die." @TheMan
We're going to push to make judgements. At the end of the day, products and services are bought by people. Machines are there because we've put them there. The transition between now and then is what we need to work on." @jfgagne
The demographics of the world are changing. I think there will be a need for all of this information to be imparted to an older generation. Our skills will be repurposed." Loren Busby
"Your relationships with the brick and mortar can be very complicated." Loren Busby
"Were looking for someone who's building technology. It''s real AI vs. fake AI. Many investors are getting caught flat footed. Investors need to ask how much computing power they're using. The level of expertise is very low." @TheMan
"It's super critical to have women and diverse perspectives to ensure the proper outcomes in AI." @jfgagne
"You have a lot of focused national and local organizations that try to bring women together and network amongst each other. There's more women under the radar, but they don't bubble up to the top."Loren Busby
"AI works from being exposed to examples. It doesn't solve every problem, but it will be part of a solution." @jfgagne
"Unfortunately the knowledge is not spreading fast enough. It's a small group of people. Experts have been trained in a masters degree. We need trained technicians. Lack of access makes it hard for companies to adapt it." @jfgagne
"I advise people not to undersell of underdeliver." Loren Busby
"In the early startup hype phase, really good AI is hard to find." @TheMan
"I'm excited about robotics. One of the companies we graduated is building a learning system for assembly robotics. If the robot can be trained in simulation, it's a huge deal. Robots are cool because you can see the physical!" @TheMan
"I'm seeing a lot of interesting changes. There's been lot of changing in the supply chains as drugs are being developed." -Loren Busby
"We take a lot of these principals for granted. It's been impacting more and more people. It's an abstract concept. It's not something we can touch. For a lot of people AI is magical. From the beginning we need to educate people and help demystify AI." @JFGagne
"I ended up building software to help people make decisions. I went through the journey. Science has been rapidly growing and expanding."@JFGagne
The LA Dodgers had the 1st Crypto Giveaway in pro sports with their Digital Bobblehead Night. The first 40,000 fans in the stadium received a token to download a digital bobblehead of a player and then they can be added to an Ethereum wallets. Digital giveways—like/dislike?
In hopes of limiting recalls involving food-borne illnesses, Walmart announced that in 2020, they will require Cali-based produce companies such as Dole and Fresh Express to join a blockchain-based supply chain. Would you buy items if they came through blockchain like or dislike?
Scientists call for ‘no selfie’ zones after almost 300 people have been killed while taking selfies. People have drown, been hit by traffic, and have fallen while taking selfies. Nearly three quarters of the victims are male. No selfie zones in dangerous areas—like or dislike?
We're LIVE on SiriusXM Business Channel discussing AI and Venture Capital with @JFGagne, @TheMan and Loren Busby! Tune in!
@SiriFomsgaard Thank you! You too! ❤️
We are now LIVE on Reddit! Log in, take a look, and feel free to ask questions! https://t.co/Ko7lIUjGIQ
Hi there friends! At 1pm EDT tomorrow (Sept 27), I will be answering your questions live on Reddit—Ask Me Anything! u/Randi_Z_IAMA ! I hope you all can take a look!
"We as women can be any shape, any size, any color! You can go in the ring and kick some ass and then put on a beautiful Versace gown and be the same woman." @HeatherHardyBox
"This is a historic time for women in sports. We want to celebrate what is happening in society and get these female athletes what they rightfully deserve." @sogoldschmidt
"When you're a young girl with dreams, you're not thinking about the inequalities. Don't be afraid to speak up. Fight for what is rightfully your's. You are not just doing it for yourself. Think of the big picture and never underestimate yourself." @Steph_gilmore
"We want to work with others to keep the conversation going. It's a no brainer to back these great female athletes." @sogoldschmidt
"In boxing, only 2% of fighters make money. The gender gap in pay is serious! When I did my 15th pro fight, I sold $40,000 in tickets and only made $7,000. Then 5 minutes later, a man with the exact same creditentuals as I had made $150,000 from his fight." @HeatherHardyBox
"In general, there are different ways where we can help accelerate a change and reset what has happened in the past. Women do deserve an equal amount of opportunity. It's great or everyone. Women need to help women." @sogoldschmidt
"The guys love to see us progress. I feel much more camaraderie between men and women in my league and I'm lucky." @Steph_gilmore
"In boxing, sometimes girls get more respect than the guys do because men know how much work we put into it. Inside the gym, people are not biased against women. There's a different culture inside the gym then what is seen from a business view." @HeatherHardyBox
"There is such a gender gap that there shouldn't be." @Steph_gilmore
"I've been able to work with progressive groups and great leaders who have welcomed different perspectives and views, but the reality is is that women are not working in higher level sports when hundreds of thousands want to." @Steph_gilmore
"Surfing is more challenging to film. Technologies has made a massive difference. Using drones to live stream our sport is much more accessible now." @sogoldschmidt
"It's so hard to get support because women's fights are not televised. HBO is refusing to televise my amazing fight at Madison Square Garden! It's unbelievable!" @HeatherHardyBox
"Some sports can't afford to make dramatic changes overnight. Women in many industries deserve to be invested in and backed. Just because they've been held back in the past, does not mean they need to be held back in the future!" @sogoldschmidt
Sometimes we need to turbocharge progress and change. The reality is that women were held back for so long. When there is the opportunity to put men and women on the same platform, often times women do better than the men!"@sogoldschmidt
"I'd won four world titles in a row and my achievements weren't being valued. It was crazy to me that men who had won one, were worth more than I was. There would be so many more great women surfers if they didn't have to work two jobs." @Steph_gilmore
"I remember in the early stages in my career the governing body of surfing wasn't able to support itself. Women were always the second priority. It felt normal to be the second choice for the best waves." @Steph_gilmore
"It was 2010 until they let women box in the Olympics. What we can ask people to do is spread the word. We're everywhere. We're moms, we're businesswomen, we're firefighters. We just haven't had the chance to compete." @HeatherHardyBox
China now claims new wasabi and hot chicken wing flavors for an American classic snack food. No, it’s not Doritos or Cheetos or anything you’d think would make sense. It’s Oreos. Wasabi and hot chicken wing flavored Oreos, delicious or disgusting beyond belief—like or dislike?
Halloween costume site Yandy got itself in trouble for its tone deaf “Brave Red Maiden”—an obvious sexy take on the Handmaid’s Tale costume. The site pulled the costume for the backlash it received for missing the point. Objectifying modern problems—like or dislike?
Non-alcoholic spirits brand, Seedlip, has introduced the world’s first 'NOLO’ bar (" no &amp; low alcohol.") The goal is to get consumers focused on unique flavor experiences instead of focusing on liquoring up. Are alcohol-free bars buzz worthy or just a buzz kill—like or dislike?
And...we’re LIVE on SiriusXM Business Channel 132! Tune in to listen to my conversation with   @Steph_Gilmore @HeatherHardyBox @SoGoldschmidt!
"Orange days are every 25th day of the month. Please participate! So, we will launch a new hashtag that is linked to a movement." @aldijanasisic
"We need to change the structure. Men can't think: If I can get away with it, I'll do it." @aldijanasisic
"I have seen a shift in behavior and it may not be how we envision it. I've overheard men say: Well I should be careful now. And even that is positive because we are raising awareness that there are consequences to your behavior." Neeta Rastogi Singh
"People still want to hear the good story. You don't have to do much to help. You just have to understand that together we can make a change that will last much longer." @aldijanasisic
"Men and boys are normally the perpetrators of violence. We must give men excellent role models." Neeta Rastogi Singh
"It's very important for parents to raise their sons with openness. We must bring up boys to the best standard of boyhood." @aldijanasisic
"The key thing is for young people to learn how to become great leaders. Think with your head and lead with your heart!" @aldijanasisic
"My mentor was my grandmother. She is my fallback on decision making. Throughout my life, I was very lucky. Many of my colleagues both male and female have helped me." @aldijanasisic
"When you wake up in the morning, one thing you can't say to yourself is: Oh I don't want to go to work today! One thing that drives me is my passion for my work. Is doesn't matter what career you're in, you must have a purpose and passion." @aldijanasisic
"We still have a lot of progress to make. But, we need to look at the progress we've made. Ten years ago we didn't we speak about domestic violence as a public issue. It was very private. Now, there is attention being given to gender equality in companies." @AldijanaSisic
"I come from a very patriarchal society, being Indian. I get all of my strength from my parents. They've always been so supportive to educate both their sons and daughter to the highest education level they could. I never felt like I couldn't do something." Neeta Rastogi Singh
"We are very conditioned in society to fit in the mould because we don't want to be different. When they are very young boys play toys that are prescribed to them. I'm still surprised to see pink for a girl and blue for a boy. There's pink and green and orange!"@AldijanaSisic
"In the startup world, women have a much more difficult time raising capital. When we step into the room, investors don't know how much value we bring in decision making. There's a constant struggle between being assertive, kind and soft spoken at once." Neeta Rastogi Singh
"Personal became professional. I became an activist of human rights because of my experience, which eventually led me to the UN." @AldijanaSisic
Now, the Toronto Public Library has a Dial-A-Story hotline that people can call at anytime to hear stories in one of 16 languages. The stories run four or five minutes and change daily. Dial-up bedtime stories for busy parents, like or dislike?
'Sidekicks’ were designed to combat the issue of smartphone addiction. Each item can only function when a smartphone is plugged into it and left untouched. Once the phone is being used, then the respective object will not work. Using tech to save us from tech—like or dislike?
A woman arranged separate dates to meet in Union Square. Dozens of men showed up only to learn the woman had tricked them into a marketing ploy for Tinder. From pushups to sprints, she led a Hunger Games-style competition for a date with her. Marketing viral stunts, like/dislike?
And...Dot Complicated is LIVE on Business Radio @SIRIUSXM! Listen in on my conversation with ALDIJANA SISIC / @AldijanaSisic and Neeta Rastogi Singh!

@virginiarmoore Thank you!!!!! I had such fun!
"Everyone thought it was a fad, and every time I would tell them about VR, they said it would only last a few years. Instead of explaining to them, I found it was more beneficial to go out and film and bring it back to them." @RXahra / @ContrastVR
"The Times is an old institution that is experimenting. We work with the international desk, talking to editors about which story works with VR. Through that interaction, we found that when reporters thought their story worked with VR, they wanted us to come along." @vedashastri
@akaBruno Ha! You nailed it!
"In VR, it is ethically very difficult to engage with everyone that they are in the shot. Most people know what a camera looks like no matter how remote that part of the world is, but they don't understand that 360 cameras feature the whole scene." @RXahra / @ContrastVR
"We were really interested in solving how do you use technology to empower people of color?  There are so many experiences that locals want to share that the news does not cover." @RXahra / @ContrastVR
"We saw that it was really powerful to show the scale of the destruction of natural disasters. It's very eerie. 360 conveys what it's actually like to be on at the scene and the energy and vibe of the place." @vedashastri
"There have only been 35 women of color who have raised over a million in capital for fundraising."
"I had to make a decision. The tough part was raising capital for my startup because of who I am and the way I look. I didn't match the description of the traditional CEO." @RXahra / @ContrastVR
"We got to experiment so much. You have to publish something, so you're creative thinking is pushed to the max." @vedashastri
"I wanted to find new ways to give voice to peoples' stories. I found that I loved visual story telling." @VedaShastri
"Platforms are shaping the way we view the news." @RXahra / @ContrastVR
Couples are opting out from having individual Instagram accounts and opening up a joint one for more PDA love, but would you follow them, like or dislike?
Las Vegas unveiled a new selfie station as a flashy alternative to the nearly 60-year-old iconic Welcome to Las Vegas sign. The new sign changes colors and is flanked by two, 26-foot-tall showgirls. Selfie stations in high traffic areas like or dislke?
A digital marketing company in Minneapolis introduced “fur-ternity leave” for its employees. This pawternity leave allows new pet parents to work from home and now many Fortune 500 companies are, too, offering pet insurance. Paw-ternity leave and insurance for pets, like/dislike?
Friends! Tune in to @SIRIUSXM Business Radio Channel 132 because Dot Complicated is LIVE! We're featuring Zahra Rasool @RXahra / @ContrastVR and Veda Shastri @VedaShastri and discussing journalism in 360 VR!
"The job landscape is changing and we want to make sure we train students in a personal way using tutorials preparing us for change and adaption." @JoshuaBroggi
"Like the Internet, Blockchain will impact every single field. It's like learning a new language." @santisiri
"Capital raising and bureaucracy are my life these days, but each have their charm!" @JoshuaBroggi
"We need to make sure that people are willing to learn these skills because at the end of the day you can only protect your digital privacy yourself. We need to teach kids to code at a young age and protect their privacy early on." @santisiri
"We're always thinking about students and how can we equip students in a changing career landscape." @JoshuaBroggi
"It's a definitely a marathon to keep a long-term vision. It's critical to embrace blockchain fundamentals. Its about rethinking government as a human rights platform." @santisiri
"Smart contracts are a great way of keeping promises where there is no need for a third party to intervene." @JoshuaBroggi
"Bitcoin is disrupting the dollar and certainly voting can benefit from this technology and it can give us a better democracy." @santisiri
"We're having a discussion whether or not Bitcoin should be a legal currency in Venezuela." @santisiri
"Woolf University is organized collegiately. It's a very democratic system. In some ways it's similar to Oxford's system. We're designing a Blockchain system that much more user-friendly." @JoshuaBroggi
"The one thing we don't get to decide is where we are born. We need technologies that are borderless." @santisiri
"Out of nowhere came this currency that connects you immediately to the global market and many minds that are looking into cutting edge software. We should have a currency that does not involve a third party or a big brother!" @santisiri
"There are two big issues that challenge higher education. The first is adjunct contracts and the second is student debt, which is completely out of control. So finding anything that might reduce administration costs is a win!" @JoshuaBroggi
Forget steak, fish and chicken, everything from ice cream, candy and PB&amp; J are the newest foods being paired with wines. Like the producers of Slice of Wine, a red wine made specifically for pizza pairings. Wine and junk food, like or dislike?
Tilt is part of the 360º observation deck of the second tallest skyscraper in Chicago. Tilt actually tilts, letting viewers lean 45º over the edge of the window, 1000 feet above the city from the 94th floor. Leaning over a skyscraper in the Windy City, like or dislike?
A Colorado school district dropped Mondays to have a 4-day school week. Anticipating $1million in savings—$700k in removing one day of school busses alone—they plan to offer childcare on Mondays for $30 a day per child to help parents. Removing a day of schooling- like/dislike?

"It's on us as the gatekeepers and programmers to satisfy the whole audience. I've never programmed a show and said there are too many female comics on this show. We are actively trying to balance airing male and female comics." @shebiro
"I've always loved sketch comedy. It's easier to have another voice in the room as a gauge of what is funny. There is no comedy in a vaccum. We write to make people laugh." @shebiro
"My advice is to just do it and keep doing it. Your taste is better than your ability when you start. You know what you like and what you want to be, but you don't know how to do it. You've got to slog through the self-hate and it'll get better!" @shebiro
"There is a 23 stem system to make an episode of The Simpsons. It's just endless re-writing. We re-write eight times. Often 100% of the material has been changed by the time it airs." @MikeReissWriter
"Everyone can be funny unintentionally. By in large, comedy is not something you're born with. You can be naturally funny and reactive. You can't teach people to be funny, but you can teach structure and timing." @shebiro
"I've been doing the same speech and jokes for 20 years and sometimes there aren't laughs and I have to cut things because I've noticed people are sensitive to the weirdest things." @MikeReissWriter
"Every channel has their own personality. We want to cater to all audiences." @shebiro
"In troubled times, people want to laugh. You don't see many conservative comics. I think that it's because comics view the world and comment on it. They want to challenge those observations and stand up to authority." @shebiro
"The Simpsons is a show abut human folly. The better the world gets, the worse the show gets. When Donald Trump was elected, Fox called and said you're picked up for 2 more years. When the world unravels, our show becomes funnier." @MikeReissWriter
"I basically started as a writer at UCB. The company was just one of those things where it started as we don't know what we're doing and grew into something so huge and unbelievable." @shebiro
"A journalist who I'd never met called me up and said. 'Mike, we're going to drive across America and the book won't cover the Simpsons at all.' Well, my mom always told me to take rides from strangers!" @MikeReissWriter
"The Simpsons predates cell phones and the Internet. We had a big 1 volume encyclopedia in the center of the room for all our weird, obscure references. Now we have technology." @MikeReissWriter
"Other families had a Bible and our family had a joke encyclopedia. I never wanted to be a comedian. I just liked to write. I used to write for the class clown and lean over to best friend Kyle and say, 'Hey, Kyle, try this one!'" @MikeReissWriter
"I knew people had to do something for a living. I just wanted to go to a job where people laughed." @shebiro
"People don't just like watching comedy, they also love listening to comedy! We cover such a spectrum. We play standup comedy like a juke box. We have different channels for different needs." @shebiro
"Take anything that comes your way!"  @MikeReissWriter
The two co-head writers of Saturday Night Live recently took a lie detector test for Vanity Fair. Both were asked questions about their personal politics revealing a definite difference between the two. Lie detectors and comedy—would you even have a job?? Like or dislike?
For those who eat on the go, the DipClip is a condiment holder that attaches to any air vent in cars. This holds the 5 most common sauce containers—think McDonald’s Sweet and Sour or Burger King ketchup. Clip-on condiment container holders so we can eat and drive—like or dislike?
Now that there’s a cap on Uber drivers in NYC, one Amish man is getting around regulations with a horse-and-buggy ride share service in Michigan. Is this ride share system literally putting the cart before the horse or will his company soon be acquired by Bird—like or dislike?

"Great people get great people to events. Spend your time getting a great speaker and lean into the community aspect of the event." BEN HINDMAN @BennyDotEvents
"When throwing an event, think about effort and impact. You need to think about every dollar you're throwing in and what you'll get back." MARISSA AYDLETT @MarissaAydlett  / @Braze
"We think a lot about how data can fuel creativity." MARISSA AYDLETT @MarissaAydlett  / @Braze
"There are so many women in the NYC community that have developed marketing skills. It used to be such a west coast talent, but not anymore and I wanted to bring them together!" AMY HOLTZMAN @DemandMarketer / @SplashThat
"It really makes a difference if you focus on the before and after, as well as the during!" MARISSA AYDLETT @MarissaAydlett  / @Braze
"The perfect invitation really coveys exactly what the event is about and makes the reader register to go immediately. You want something enticing and flashy that draws people!" AMY HOLTZMAN @DemandMarketer / @SplashThat
"The event itself is just the beginning. The thing that most people don't think about it the follow-through after the event."MARISSA AYDLETT @MarissaAydlett  / @Braze
"Events have to be creative and they are definitely complex. You want your event to look as good online as it does in your mind!" BEN HINDMAN @BennyDotEvents
"I would say that innovators should pay attention to what people do, not what they say. Usage is king/queen!" BEN HINDMAN @BennyDotEvents
"Anyone who throws big events knows that it's all about controlled chaos. How well can you fail?!" BEN HINDMAN @BennyDotEvents
"I've always been a learner. I wanted to couple technology with experiences!" -MARISSA AYDLETT @MarissaAydlett  / @Braze
Tired of your mate stealing the covers at night? The Cover Clamp locks down your side of the sheets with a heavy-duty clamp to keep blankets on your side of the bed. Like or dislike?
A unique mix of soccer and cycling—exactly what it sounds like—cycle ball players ride specially designed bicycles that can flick a ball in a goal. Hey, it's big in Europe. Cycle ball, a new Olympian sport or is it glorified Frisbee golf—like or dislike?
Parents are leveling-up their kids’ future success by hiring tutors—not for academics—but to become better Fortnite players. The Wall Street Journal reported families are paying up to $30/hour just so kids can be better gamers. Could gaming be the next scholarship? Like/ dislike?

"Masculinity and leadership are strongly correlated. People look to masculinity. Women have to walk a careful line. Women do not come to mind for leadership positions and when they do get them, they are punished." Dr. Stacy L. Smith @Inclusionists
"If you're not talking about it, you're silent. If you're silent, it's interpreted that you either don't care or you don't understand." Annie Yu @voxmediainc
"If you're only having white males evaluate the film, you're really doing a disservice to the audience by only having one critical voice. It's a misrepresentation. If you had more diversity in critics, more critics would point out the lack of diversity onscreen." @Inclusionists
"Training usually means you're doing something wrong. There are people who are frustrated who go to the training and then there are people who think training doesn't apply to them. Our training focuses on understanding." - Annie Yu @voxmediainc
"We play games with the data. We ask how do you fix a system that refuses to be fixes?! We found that if you add 5 female speaking characters to each feature film, in 4 four years you will have equality in onscreen film portrayal." -Stacy L. Smith @Inclusionists
"There is all talk and no action in Hollywood- A wash, rinse, and repeat. Until action in hiring diversity happens in Hollywood and until those numbers move off camera, no changes will be made on camera." -Stacy L. Smith @Inclusionists
"You're not actually learning if you don't change the way or think or the way you do something." -Annie Yu @voxmediainc
"I credit Legally Blonde and The Devil Wears Prada in giving me confidence that women don't have to take a backseat!" -Annie Yu @voxmediainc
We like to think of ourselves as the leading global think tank!"-Dr. Stacy L. Smith @Inclusionists
Today we have two incredibly smart women on Dot Complicated Dr. Stacy L. Smith @Inclusionists and Annie Yu @voxmediainc!
To tackle public urination, Paris officials have installed pissoirs, or urinals in the city. A layer of straw masks the pee smell and waste will be used for composting, but the urinals are fully exposed—there’s no door or privacy. Open-air urinals —like or dislike?
Have any of you ever wanted to know what you weigh after taking a shower? Complete with infrared technology and air vents, Samsung’s new scale allows users to weigh themselves and dry off at the same time. A scale that weighs you AND gets you dry faster—like or dislike?
With smartphone battery life decreasing and the desperate need for a recharge increasing, pranksters are putting fake power outlet stickers in high traffic/low battery demand areas like airports. Are fake power outlets cruel punishment or actually kind of hilarious—like/dislike?

"Sometimes parents push kids and its good because the kids don't know if they are interested. But unless they want to participate and be there, they won't make it." -Serena McCalla @ScienceFairFilm
"We're very excited for the film to come out in theaters in the fall! One of the reasons why I chose to make this documentary is so kids can see how fun fun science is. An educational campaign is definitely at the center of this project." -CRISTINA CONSTANTINI @xtinatini
"The program works because the kids know that even if I am assertive, I am there for them and I like them. I am a stern coach, but I also love them. When they need a break, I give them a break and when they step out of line, I reprimand them." -Serena McCalla @ScienceFairFilm
"Some projects are outside of biology. If I don't know the topic, I learn from the kids and what blanks they can't fill in, I contact specialists and read to learn for myself. It's fun for me. I get paid to learn!" -Serena McCalla @ScienceFairFilm
"The kids who do well at the science fair are the kids who have parents who offer support, but who step out of the way when they need to."  -DARREN FOSTER @darren_foster
"If we can pay athletes astronomical salaries, why can't we pay educators more who challenge children's minds." -Serena McCalla @ScienceFairFilm
"Women are not thought of as scientists. Because we know that, we need to encourage women to follow the select few women scientists and build up female mentors." -Serena McCalla @ScienceFairFilm
"The science is amazing, but it's really their personal stories that draw you in!" -DARREN FOSTER @darren_foster @ScienceFairFilm
"My dad is an immigrant. This is personal and timely story. At first it was just about special, funny kids and then it became a message that we should be talking about in current political times." -CRISTINA CONSTANTINI @xtinatini @ScienceFairFilm
"When I was in the lab it really excited me that I was figuring things out that no one had the answers to!" -SERENA McCALLA @ScienceFairFilm
"I think you get a wide spectrum of students at Science Fair. You don't have to be the smartest to win. You just have to have a great idea and follow through."-SERENA McCALLA @ScienceFairFilm
Ever felt jealous over a friend’s victory? Blame the Self-Evaluation Theory that says we are threatened far more by loved ones who excel in areas we define ourselves by, than by strangers who excel in the exact same way. Our subconscious to blame for being a jerk, like/ dislike?
People are paying to be slapped in the face for several minutes to tighten skin and remove wrinkles. However, results aren't permanent! You'll have to go back! Popular in Thailand, face boxing also has one certified company in San Fran. Slapped for beauty, like or dislike?
CGI influencers are taking over social media! As virtual influencers and digital supermodels promote brands, their success is leading to ethical questions about transparency with customers. Shunning the role of real influencers with computer-generated graphics, like or dislike?

"The problem Yext solves is: how does one update business info at a large scale with many, many different locations. It allows you to update that info instantaneously." -@ofegan
@jitendramr You're right! This was more of a discussion topic thrown into the L&amp;D mix. Thanks for noticing!
Want to give the perfect gift to your meat-loving sweetie? A gift that puts the cute in “charcuterie”? You can purchase a 3-5 bundle salami bouquet made with some of Portland, OR's all natural Northwest pork. Putting the “ass” in class or the “fan” in fancy, like or dislike?

"Pride is one day, but it's also 364 other days that the community has to feel supported. If done correctly, it also advertises that company as a place as having their doors open to you. That's how a company attracts the best and brightest talent." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"I think a lot the pride marketing is often a way of generating cheap publicity. It's a way of saying 'OK now I've done my part'. Corporations are looking out for their shareholders at the end of the day." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"Diversity is good for business, it's at your peril to get it wrong. We're a smart community that knows where to look. Being an ally and supporting the community is more than a noun, being an ally is a verb. You have to support with your dollars!" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"I think that it really depends on how open you want to be. It's not a judgement against our community, it's that there are people who still have biases." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"More successes that are open are ways to change the stereotypes! You need more of a track record. There's a hesitation for people to be open, people still have the perception that it will hurt them in business. We need more courage." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"LGBT entrepreneurs are in every field, in every industry, in every state of the union" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"Even with leading experts I still get asked 'so LGBT businesses, we're talking bakeries and promo products', but I say 'May I also introduce you to this incredible LGBT owned company that has a government national security contract?'" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"The number is exponentially increasing. There's only been an LGBT certification for about 12 years or so, so we're playing catch up. But the good news is how fast the companies are pouring in. If you build it they will come." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"When you're having a problem with your computer, you call IT and wait to hear from them. What I'm working on now is a way for users not to have to wait for IT, but a portal they can go on with an AI bot that can fix the issues automatically." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"I love supporting the community, I go to networking events, @NGLCC has great mixers every month." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"We now have 5 chambers in Texas and we're starting a chamber in Des Moines, Iowa! It's their time to shine, it's really exciting to see." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"Knowing that those places were safe to be out and professional made them high growth areas. Part of what we're doing now is that there's inclusion in towns large and small. Online, you don't have to feel like you're the only one in the village anymore." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"The LGBT comm spends $917 billion dollars in goods and services. The companies that lead with being inclusive, that's how you lead in your community and makes the community say they're going to buy this companies food over that companies food." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"It's so hard to get customers as it is, that if you're not using your resources, it would be impossible!" Robert Geller @InstanTek
"Use the connections your community organizations have for you. It's the tool in your tool belt to get you a little further along." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"I believe that people should take advantage of their cards. Every successful entrepreneur has taken advantage of the cards they've been dealt. At the end of the day, nothing is all about merit." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"The @NGLCC is known as the business voice of the LGBT community. We can certify a company as being LGBT owned, we're also calling up big corporations and asking them to get to know business from the minority community!" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"Everyone's entrepreneurial journey is different, know that there are resources and when you're ready to take advantage of them, there's an LGBT family ready to help you grow." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"We have to remember there are people in small towns all over America who don't feel they can be as fully out in starting their own business, especially with the inconsistency of legal processes." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"I enjoy the creative process. Entrepreneurship is almost as much about creativity as it is about making money! Money isn't my driving force." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"I started in IT when I was 17, I didn't go to college, I wasn't a big fan of academia. I was managing systems and then I moved to a larger company and I just hated being in an office. I wanted to make my own future and do my own thing." Robert Geller @InstanTek
"Thankfully some big corporations are standing up for this community because it's the best thing to do for our economy!" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"LGBT business owners in the US put 1.7 trillion dollars into the economy every single year and yet we're not given an equal seat at the table and nearly enough environment! The SBA, at the change of administration, erased all LGBT resources from the websites." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"I'm really lucky that my day job and my gay job are the same thing!" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"We just don't know enough, thankfully we exist to certify businesses as LGBT owned so they can be a part of a supply chain and a part of state and local governments." @jdlovitz @NGLCC
"It's been a wide range of careers but everything I've been involved in has been inherently entrepreneurial, being a self starter, taking an opportunity and running with it!" @jdlovitz @NGLCC
A 3D recognition system could soon replace the MetroCard for using the subway in as little as 3 years. Developed by the Bristol Robotics Lab, the 3D tech uses your face as the key to everything from ATMs to airplanes. Facial recognition, like or dislike?

“It’s so noisy out there. To get through the noise is to make your content customer-centric and customer-friendly!” @DaveKerpen
“Im so astounded by how many entreprenurs and small business owners aren’t leveraging social media the way they could be. LinkedIn is performing really well for our customers. Also, being more customer centric and less you centric is a good rule for a marketer. ” @DaveKerpen

“Ultimately talking to a peer, a therapist, or a partner. One of my proudest traits as an entrepreneur leader is helping my teams go deep and be vulnerable!” @DaveKerpen
“For many people exercise is really valuable in terms of getting your body moving and blood flowing. A lot of people struggling with depression get themselves out of it partly through exercise!” @DaveKerpen
“UMA’s idea is to connect people with therapists and coaches. Comfortable and transparent! 50% of people who have mental health care offered through their job, don’t do it through that channel. So UMA helps people find what they need.” @DaveKerpen
“We have to normalize mental illness first. We dont want people to feel like going to see their therapist like they’re going to the dentist.” @DaveKerpen
“Everyone can benefit from working with a therapist on your mental health. We’re at a tipping point in society where we are going to start to pay more attention to this problem.” @DaveKerpen
“If you wanna see a trainer to work on your physical health it’s great. If you want to see a therapist, it’s ‘What’s wrong? What’s the matter with you?’” @DaveKerpen
“As important as the moral reasons are for fixing the mental health stigma, when it hits peoples wallets, people pay attention!” @DaveKerpen
“Peer groups for entrepreneurs are so powerful. It can dend off the loneliness and the challenges.” @DaveKerpen
“There are major highs and lows in entrepreneurship. It comes with higher highs and lower lows. It’s also very lonely at the top. If you’re a business owner you can’t necessarily complain to your 9-5 friends.” @DaveKerpen
“I reached out to the founder of UMA. I said Im really passionate about mental health, if you’re willing to focus on mental health, I’ll come on as CEO and help lead it.” @DaveKerpen

“I only realized a couple weeks ago that I had buried mental illness within my own family.” @DaveKerpen
“We started Likeable and that was our first major company. Recently I came to UMA Health and there was an opportunity that had a lot of personal value!” @DaveKerpen
“My proposal was very intimate and private. Our wedding was big. I’m larger than life and so we partnered with the Brooklyn Cyclones. We got married at the end of the game in front of fans and raised money for charity!” @DaveKerpen
“It was the darkest time in my life because there was nothing entrepreneurial about it! I wasn’t contributing anything.” @DaveKerpen
Earlier this week the World Health Organization announced "gaming disorder" as a new mental health condition. WHO hopes that classifying gaming disorder as a mental illness will help shine light on these conditions— but will it? What are your thoughts?

What industry do you think the first Black female owned billion dollar business will be? @BWTalkTech @jessomatt #energy
Thank you to joining me today @TresseNoire @COSIGN @keepupapps who make up @BWTalkTech ! #BlackWomenBillionFounders
We have a newsletter where we share all the information we come across. @BWTalkTech It's lead to people getting funded!
We're working on a new membership platform called The Collective. @BWTalkTech
When you have the pressure not to fail, a lot of founders won't ask for help. Look at Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade who were holding it all in. It's not worth it. Figure out ways to be vulnerable and ask for help. @BWTalkTech
If you're not working 24/7, #TeamNoSleep does NOT mean you are not committed to your business. @BWTalkTech
We're not going to truly be equal in tech until we allow ourselves to fail to at the same rate white men are allowed to fail. @BWTalkTech
When you're doing something you love you have to fight through being the face of your company. You don't have to give every aspect of your life on social, but they want to see why you're excited about it and who you are. @keepupapps
Chart your growth on your terms. @TresseNoire
When I started @TresseNoire I was working full time. It's so important to continue to have access to capital. Keeping the lights on is just as important sa growing your business. You have to do it your way.
I've met people who raised up to $6m through government funding. You have to be patient but there's money out there. @COSIGN
I don't address my diverse-ness but it is a good angle. I want to open up different conversations. @COSIGN
I tried to raise money in so many different ways. I did a ton of pitch competitions. You could apply for free and if they were in another state they'd pay your way and room and board PLUS you can win! I won close to 100k in comps! @COSIGN
Call in with questions for the three cofounders of @BWTalkTech at 1-844-wharton! #BlackWomeninTech #Blackfemaleentrepreneurs
Other routes for fundraising are available. Most businesses fail but they should fail for inter-business reasons not because of funding. @BWTalkTech
I won the @forty3north competition. I kept hitting a wall after that win. It should've been a marker but it wasn't. @keepupapps
It was exciting to get support through @kickstarter but first I had to educate my community to what Kickstarter was. @COSIGN
There's a common misconception that Black woman in tech don't exist. There was time I went into speak at a conference and they told me they were waiting for the founder. ME. @COSIGN
We deal with the same things a lot of minorities deal with. Then there's the intersectionality of being a woman and a minority. We're too angry, too aggressive. We're fighting these stereotypes and the mirroring. @BWTalkTech
We've always been the only 'chocolate drops' in the room. I'd wave and say hi. @TresseNoire We started to talk about our experiences about trying to scale our businesses. It was like WOW, if the three of us are having these problems other women of color are too.
I was introduced to tech through 'there's an app for that' phase. I would go to different conferences. My friend left his job to start an app company and I was intrigued. I always saw myself as being an entrepreneur but I didn't know where yet. I took the plunge. @COSIGN
We talked to tons of women about their styling experience. Do you want to be up at 3 am figuring it out yourself, no? Do you want your hair singed with a blow dryer, no? We wanted to understand the pain points through our app. @TresseNoire
I've always been tech adjacent. I created FB ads for businesses when there were none. I've always been into Big Data. @keepupapps

"It's going to be a slow fix. The civil rights movement isn't 100 years old and we're still fighting. We gonna be fighting for abortion rights. We're gonna keep fighting. Let's fight!" @joyellenicole
"We need to dismantle the patriarchy not assist it. Get out there and vote guys!" @joyellenicole
"The good news is that if you look at the next generation, they're not taking it. They've grown up in a different environment in terms of gender equality. They've been trained about bullying in school. They're gonna be much more vocal." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"Women need to help women as well. When I hear women calling other co-workers girls, we're not helping ourselves." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"Advice to men. Talk to your boys! If you hear them say something, say something. A guy is going to listen to his friend more than a woman." @joyellenicole
"I'm a black female in comedy, it's a white man's industry! I like it when I can be like 'This is our black girl show, good I don't have to listen to white boys talk about dogs for 40 minutes.'" @joyellenicole
"For men that come forward about their own experiences, we need allies! I think the more people that come out the more people will be empathetic to the women." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"One of the people I look up to, he's doing comedy about how he doesn't hire women because of the me too movement! You think we want to accuse these men? Nobody wants to do that!" @joyellenicole
"The definition of sexual harassment is severe and pervasive. It has to be one or the other. At organizations there's a spectrum of behavior. Most organizations their definitions are broader than the law." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"For comedians social media has been very powerful. Everyone walks around with a microphone in their pocket these days. It's amplified all the stuff that's going on. We have these ways to amplify it." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"He said funny and unfunny comes from the same place. Our intention at the end of the day is to make people laugh. Unfunny and offensive is just gonna come out. The best comedians do cross that line. But when you touch me, that's a problem." @joyellenicole
"There is such a thing as too far. Patrice O'Neil was an extremely offensive comedian! He would harass and clown you up and down. But I loved being around him because he was amazing!" @joyellenicole
"My industry rewards men and only cares about men. There are certain comedy clubs where if you tell someone, they're gonna punish the woman, they're not gonna punish the guy." @joyellenicole
"If you're in a workplace and something mkaes you uncomfortable you should let someone know. It doesn't mean they'll get fired. If you tell someone, they can change their behaviors, sometimes they don't know. If there's a place to do it, tell someone." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"One guy when he greets me, he kisses me on the neck, he started sniffing me. They'll test who they can get away with what with." @joyellenicole
"Open-micers. I feel like a man like that, who's like Harvey, he was doing stuff like that when he wasn't Harvey. It's a progression. I know those creeps, when they start." @joyellenicole
"Let's talk about what's going on in our lives and how it's impacting us!" Debbie Muller @hracuity
"If you don't know the difference between compliment and harassment, don't compliment us. We don't need your compliments. Shut up!" @joyellenicole
"Required harassment training is helpful. There are women who have gone through it and said it helped them to understand what's acceptable and what's not. But companies shouldn't have to teach morality and keep their things in their pants." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"Women who accused Louis CK said they lost their careers because they came forward. There are women who have gotten swept under the rug and can't do anything after coming forward. That's all it has to be for us, you don't get booked you don't have a career." @joyellenicole
"We hosted leaders from tech companies, and these organizations that typically compete for talent got together and shared how to make the employee experience better. How do we bring transparency. They want to come together and make things right." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"There are organizations that are saying they'll no longer do arbitration. It's going to be interesting to see if organizations will say 'we know the law says we can do it, but we won't do it.'" Debbie Muller @hracuity
"Forced arbitration is when there's an issue in an organization and instead of going to court they keep things private. It eliminates the ability to have a class action suit." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"We can't keep saying 'oh that guy is a lawsuit waiting to happen'. In corporations we have to hold those people accountable." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"I think it's starting the conversation, how to help a woman in the workplace. Men are just as alarmed by the behavior as women are if they're not part of it. It has to happen through training and through discussion. There also have to be consequences." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"Women have to have each other's backs. Period. I'm sorry white women, c'mon y'all get it together. If we don't have another woman's back how am I going to say something! That's where we need to start." @joyellenicole
"Only 33% of organizations have required processes for conducting investigations. Consistency of process is a problem. There's also lack of transparency of what's going to happen if you do report something." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"A lot of the training is shifting to bystander training. How to help other people." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"You kind of don't know what to do. I often tell people to tell another women. 80% of women have been in the same situation. Ban together and figure out how to do the right thing and move forward." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"Comedians often don't know how to report sexual harassment. The lines are blurred, we'll be in hotel rooms until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning." @joyellenicole
"Only because I'm lucky, I've never had a situation that has gone for me to report it. I've been harassed, but never had to call the police." @joyellenicole
"Sexual harassment isn't unique to the entertainment industry,but in entertainment people may feel a bit more comfortable than in a corporate setting. Those headlines are also a lot more interesting to people. It's happening across all industries though." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"The biggest change is that every production company is having women showcases now! This is a backlash from the Me Too movement, they're asking for more shows and trying to be more inclusive. I think things are changing towards the good." @joyellenicole
"I always wanted to be an entertainer, but I never thought I'd be confident enough to do comedy." @joyellenicole
"I was a very shy child, a lot of comedians are like that because we're the observers. We're sitting in the corner and staring at everything!" @joyellenicole
"So much is about women not feeling comfortable coming forward. Why aren't they coming forward? A lot of it is about fear. They don't know what to expect! A lot of that can be taken away by having consistent process in the workplace." Debbie Muller @hracuity
"I always knew I wanted to do something different, so when I decided to go off on my own I knew I was good at investigations. I knew there was a need in the market place to do senior level workplace investigations." Debbie Muller @hracuity
A Dutch blockchain company developed LegalFling, an app that creates sex contracts for consenting adults. LegalFling says that the contracts help reduce the question of consent through legally binding agreements. A sex contract app?
According to Play-Doh makers Hasbro, the “musky, sweet vanilla scent with hints of cherry scent has always been synonymous with childhood and fun.” So they trademarked the smell. Trademarking the scent of childhood...
In 2015, 311 for every 100,000 female babies born in the US were named Alexa. And last year, 20 girls were named ‘Siri,’ or about 1 per every 100,000. Time to stop naming kids after tech or will your AI respond faster than they will? Like or dislike?

“I realized I could use my ADHD to my advantage. That required a lot of changes! Everythings connected, I get the brain chemistry to do better in life. You learn how to do things to use to your advantage!” @petershankman
“When I was growing up ADHD didn’t exist. Over time, when I was 34, and I had a psychologist and I could put a name to it.” @petershankman

"I like the idea of commercial and critical successes not being distinct! There are things that appeal to the mass consciousness but still have high quality. You hear Mean Girls and Spongebob and you can dismiss it off hand, but those were great shows!" @ElysaGardner
"My advice is to meet deadlines. That's the skill that's gotten me where I am! And use the tools you have, embrace change! Learn to develop new skills, adapt to new formats." @ElysaGardner
"Know your audience, test the waters, you're not going to find the right balance right away. But just get it out there. Continue pushing forward. You'll look back and find you've improved." @neilpatel
"You can still invest time in long-form content on your phone. The limitations aren't the first thing to keep in mind!" @ElysaGardner
"Now people are on mobile phones, it needs to load faster, in other countries people have mobile phones before anything else. Some of the most popular sites traffic is becoming mobile. You have to have mobile in mind when you're creating content." @neilpatel
"There are pieces that I'm happy with and profiles of people who I either admire or who have gone on to accomplish things! I can go back and say 'it was nice to talk to that person when..." @ElysaGardner
"Two things I've learned is consistency. If you do something each and every week, people will follow you and keep coming back to you!" @neilpatel
"It takes 5, 10, 15 years to build up a strong brand! Start by helping the average joes and giving advice without looking for anything in exchange." @neilpatel
"Little is the new big! If you can help out the little people, the people who are lesser known, just by responding with a genuine answer, it will slowly start building up your brand." @neilpatel
"I think personal brands are more and more important. I try to hone those skills more. But I rely on the brands I'm associated with a lot, it's great to be associated with people I respect like the New York Stage Review." @ElysaGardner
"You're seeing the rise in tools, there's tools for almost everything. You're seeing a lot of automation - email marketing, artificial intelligence." @neilpatel
"Depending on where I write. My last staff job I was doing everything, I was cropping photos, writing subheads, promoting it on social media. It's good to master new skills! It is a challenge, just the sheer volume of work. We're all having to multi-task." @ElysaGardner
"Look at what other avenues you can go after that aren't the mainstream ones. Look to see what social networks lack the content you're creating! Like LinkedIn could use more of all forms of content, since most people just use it to find a job." @neilpatel
"You should create whatever form of content you're comfortable with! As long as the information is good, you'll be fine. When you're comfortable with a subject or topic, you're likely to produce higher quality content." @neilpatel
"You're seeing a lot of high quality production does well and low quality doesn't do well, unless it's more reality based. People expect high quality editing, design, audio. The standard keeps increasing." @neilpatel
"It's interesting because the two most nominated shows were adaptations of Mean Girls and Spongebob Squarepants, but they're not bad shows! You can have something that's commercial and artistically relevant as well." @ElysaGardner
"People are now seeing a come back of magazines, people think it's cool to get something in their mailbox that isn't junk mail!" @neilpatel
"I think these long-form shows tend to be events, especially if you're going to invest that much of your time! Bring snacks." @ElysaGardner
"https://t.co/bI51Qw2COY teaches you how to get started, write content, and make long blog posts that people want to engage with and want to read." @neilpatel
"People are getting the information that they used to pay for for free. Now you're seeing this information come on the web in mass quantity and for free. The long-form content, typically only available in subscription services, is now free." @neilpatel
"You can't discount the fan perspective either. You need a combination of perspectives!" @ElysaGardner
"The role of the professional theater critic is a matter of being informed and passionate. There is no review that is right or wrong, it's what you bring to a piece and how you receive it." @ElysaGardner
"Long form is coming back into popularity but only for 'high quality' information. All that matters is quality over anything else. If people love what they're reading they'll stick around." @neilpatel
"People started going shorter and shorter because there was already so much information online, so much information was being regurgitated. People were wanting to get their point across as quick as possible." @neilpatel
"Structure your content with an introduction, a conclusion (and label the conclusion), and of course your body in between. You want to use multiple sub-headings so people can skim. You want to use the words 'you' and 'I' so it feels like a conversation." @neilpatel
"Users like long form content. As long as the content is high in quality, people will stick around and you'll see more engagement and shares. The average page that ranks on Google is 2,220 plus words! People enjoy reading long-form content." @neilpatel
"I think it's a matter of how a show feels in whether or engaged or not. With a play like Harry Potter, so many people come so committed to the material." - @ElysaGardner
"I learned on my own and got good at online marketing. I started to give people free advice. I thought why should people pay for knowledge?" @neilpatel
"I think the arts are a necessary part, it reminds us that we're human. Art is what you can connect to on a visceral level. It can move you to think and to feel!" @ElysaGardner
"I love theater, I was a drama geek in high school and college. I wrote about music initially and then at a certain point a job came up for me to cover music and theater, so it made sense. It's been wonderful, it doesn't feel like a job." @ElysaGardner
In case you Liked pizza for breakfast and are in LA, you can get a New York pie delivered through JetBlue's 'Pie in the Sky' promotion.  Only 350 pizzas up for grabs each day on a first come, first served basis. Would you go the lengths to have a New York slice air delivered?
With a healthy mix of protein, carbs and veggies, a ‘Daily Meal' dietician says pizza is more of a balanced breakfast option than a morning bowl of cereal. Trading in your Frosted Flakes for a slice of Dominos—like or dislike?

"Really allow your brain to be flexible! One of the reasons we took over this planet as human beings was because of our flexibility and how we adapt. Try new things that seem to be challenging!" Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"I think there's going to be discussion of what sporting regulation looks like. The whole point of sport is to get an unfair advantage. It seems arbitrary to me that some of these advantages are on limits or off limits." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"We've been experimenting with sleep. I have blackout curtains. I use a white noise generator. I've been playing around with different ways to optimize sleep." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"We know that yoga and meditation really allow you to let go of the chattering of the mind. People who do it fall asleep much better. It's a skill to build, you need to stay with it for a while and you'll start to see the benefits." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"Screens are a killer of us being able to relax properly and not be stimulated. As you get closer to sleep time, gradually reduce screen time! Blue light stimulates and causes trouble sleeping." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"Sleeping between 10pm and 2am is one of the most crucial times for natural melatonin. Sleeping earlier rather than later is recommended." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"We normally see sleep getting improved first and everything else falls into place. Unless your sleep cycle is regulated in your awake time you can't function properly." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"Our company only makes products that are FDA approved. We're regulated as supplements or foods. In nootropics people are working with chemicals that are classified compounds, but we stay away from the things that have low side effects and are safe." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"One way to counteract plateauing is to have cyclical protocols to ramp on and off different interventions." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"We've seen the plateau phenomenon happen clinically. But then at some point they go to the next level. There will be a plateauing effect but with certain techniques you can get the brain to go to the next level again." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"In any society there will be people taking anything too far. People keep going deeper and deeper into the grey and black areas of cognitive enhancement!" @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"While we're measuring the activity we extract frequency with having better attention! So in real time we can reward that child for focusing the right way Gradually they can be trained to activate that portion of the brain!" Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"In order to improve attention, there are parts of the brain that are involved in that that we can boost. One of the methods we use, neuro-feedback, is scanning the brain in real time." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"A lot of people ask is intermittent fasting disordered eating? I think current eating is disordered eating! Intermittent fasting is actually a pattern of eating that we evolved with as hunter gatherers!" @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"Fasting was one of the most robust ways to jump start neurogenesis (growth of new neurons)." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"Intermittent fasting really has exploded in recent years! There's a lot of published data coming out showing that intermittent fasting helps with longevity and cognitive performance." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"For brain enhancement there's a range of advice that can be given. Simplest is to improve sleep. There's a lot of data on exercise too. Regular exercise improves brain function and cognition, weight lifting seems to be the key!" Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"We routinely measure memory recall, recognition, auditory vs visual memory and so much more. If you don't have a baseline, you could be declining or improving, but we can't detect that based on just norms." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"The brain has such an important function for human life that the body tries to maintain homeostasis - so it's hard to increase performance of a healthy human adult. It's a lot easier to improve someone that's sick or aging." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"Bio-hacking is a pretty broad term. Things like improving the protocol around diets. Applying engineering principles to human performance. Nootropics is also broad, compounds that enhance aspects of cognition (working memory capacity, reacting time etc...)" @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"One of the most interesting aspects that makes humans humans is our brain! That seemed like a reasonable place to start. Our journey into the space of human performance started out very experimental." @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"After starting and selling my first company I had a time to see what problems I wanted to work on next. I thought, why aren't people making humans better?" @geoffreywoo @hvmn
"This is a way to see at the brain level and cognitive level, where people stand. Then there's a range of interventions we discuss that can actually improve brain function." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"We do brain mapping and see where in the brain we may see some under-activation or over-activation and how that region relates to things like cognition, focus, impulse control and other things these kids may be having trouble with." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"We see a lot of children and adults with things like ADD and ADHD. We see people with Brain Injury, anxiety, depression, a range of various disorders. Or families who's kids want them to do better in school, issues with performance." Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"I started on a journey exploration of the human brain and human brain functions and how it can hack the brain today" Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY
"The brain has been a long term passion of mine when I was studying and then doing my internship and residency. I was very interested in understanding the neuropsychological underpinning of psychology!" - Dr. Fallahpour @BrainResourceNY

"Stepping out of your comfort zone is a decision. Just make the decision! We have to take action, we're in charge of our own lives. You'll have a legacy! What are you gonna leave behind and be known for?" @damienelston
"Walking away is a lot more catastrophic. People invest in people! You have a responsibility not to walk away, but to pivot. You have a responsibility to see it through for the people who joined your journey." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"We build a story with product. That's what works with getting employees! Also humility, if you come across as if you'd nailed it all and they just need to follow instructions, it's not good." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"We need women to start telling their stories more and how to sell more. There are more women entrepreneurs creating every day than men!" @damienelston
"Believing in yourself enough to tell your story so others believe in you! They're buying you because they believe you can make it work. If you want to sell yourself it's through stories. Build your story and tell it to the world." @damienelston
"You should turn side-hustles into your full time business. Create your legacy. Do it. Jump out of the plane and do it! Put that chance on you, if you do that, you will succeed. You'll make it. You'll survive!" @damienelston
"The big trend we're seeing is so many people that were cautious of leaving the workplace, now willing to go try and move beyond the 9 to 5. As we tap into the dreamer category, we're able to help them execute that." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"A lot of my life was designed about when I would start a family. I felt the most important thing to do is give time to your children. My day starts and finishes with my son." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"In my business, summer is a down time and christmas is a down time. I take July off and we spend family time, all day every day, playing and hanging out." @damienelston
"It's all about the testimonials! The reason someone hires me is that there's something in life they want that they don't have right now. When someone sends you texts or emails saying 'because of you, I was able to do this" that's really special." @damienelston
"Humility is really important, If you're going to be an entrepreneur you're going to be a leader. You can lead through arrogance or humility. That sense of vulnerability is a strong trait to bring to your vision!" @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"There's always gonna be bad things that happen that we can't control. Focus gets you over that line." @damienelston
"A successful entrepreneur needs to have passion, drive, determination. The drive and determination comes from a need. Growing up with nothing created that drive and determination in me." @damienelston
"There's a balance. Over time there have been different journeys, but at any one time there's only been one. I think 75% of your energy needs to be dedicated to one element." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"From the time I started learning about wealth creation, I've learned there's no one stream of income. The more streams of income you have the more in control you can be." @damienelston
"I feel a lot of it is due to nurturing. Entrepreneurship can definitely be nurtured. There's too much emphasis that it's OK to dream, but if you don't do the execution, there's no purpose. You have to do it in little steps to take bigger leaps." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"Passion I don't believe is something that is teachable. Sometimes I feel like something has to happen to feel that passion. I always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur, but when my first son was born, it gave me that purpose!" @damienelston
"It became my goal to raise everyone else up to my level. If I could do it, then so can you!" - @damienelston
"I got the start in coaching at 24, and then at 26 the company said 'We'd like you to start speaking for us'. Speaking in front of a crowd made no sense to me!" - @damienelston
"In 5th grade I had this idea to make cinnamon sticks. I bought cinnamon oil and soaked them before selling them. My business lasted for less than 2 weeks. The moms found out the kids were spending their lunch money on my sticks instead of lunch. I got in trouble!" @damienelston
"We've built a platform that uses AI, it takes someones idea and builds half of it automatically, and then we find people to make it unique for you without you having to know how to code!" @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"I liked the idea that past can have an impact on the future. AI takes things that have happened in the past and summarizes them and make a strong educated guess on what can happen in the future." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"I saw my mother and how she ran her company and it helped build that connection. The best thing is that when you're 15, and you mess up, you just say 'sorry' and reset." @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"I had no interest in Tech but I blew-up my mom's computer when I was 14. She said 'fix it, or else' and that got me reading to get the machine to work." - @sachinduggal @engineeringAI
"I was sitting in a class one day and the class was a seminar, and the instructor was the first person to say 'I believe in you and you can do it'. I wanted to pay that forward and give that back to as many people as I could." @damienelston
The oldest person in the world is just over 112 years old. His secret? Soaking in hot springs, eating sweets, and living a stress-free life built on telling people if he doesn’t like something, no holds barred. Is honesty the key to longevity? Like or dislike?
With the slogan "Wear Jackets, Meat Burgers," the Burger Jacket is a down-insulated, grease-resistant, and equipped with special "burger pockets" to store burgers without resulting in grease stains. Would you wear a burger jacket? Like or dislike?
California burger chain In-N-Out is suing an Australian company for copyright infringement for their restaurant called Down N’ Out. What do you think, fry again or shake it off?

...and give them that “wow” moment they can take with them into their careers. I couldn’t be more excited to be opening our third @suestechkitchen location today in Mississippi and can’t wait to welcome thousands of local high school students today and print lots of 3D s’mores! https://t.co/GXWazMGg2U
...And Sue's Tech Kitchen: Jackson, Mississippi is open for business! A few facts about tech in MS: It ranks 49/50 states in WiFi access. And only 7% of schools have advanced computer classes. That is why we are here. We need to get kids excited about tech early and... (cont) https://t.co/TETQgziJcz

"Fear of success often masks being angry. You turn it inward and hold yourself back and prevent yourself from succeeding! If you could admit that you're angry about whatever it is, it allows you to break through." @DeniseKShull
"There's big time fear of success absolutely! It gets complicated. It does have to do usually with out backgrounds, our family, what it really means to be more successful than your family or your parents." @DeniseKShull
"Patience is everything. It's really hard when you're in the kitchen, it's hot, there's a line of customers out the door. That pressure can get to you. So we say take deep breaths, one taco at a time." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"You need to educate a whole group. There's a hedge fund I work with and we've taught them all to quantify and talk about their fear. The anxiety level has gone down. The inter-team friction goes down!" @DeniseKShull
"Mental toughness is way overrated. Because you can be really afraid and angry and do the best job ever. You can hold those feelings and use that energy for focus to do what you need to do in the moment. Allow yourself to have all your feelings." @DeniseKShull
"There's so much pressure for mental toughness that amounts to not having your feelings." @DeniseKShull
"The ability to tolerate a whole range of feelings is such a competitive edge. The ability to tolerate your fury and fear, then you can just have the feeling and be pulling it apart while you're focusing on stuff that needs to get done!" @DeniseKShull
"You have to start with What am I feeling? Why am I feeling it? What is this intense feeling really about? Then you find the piece of information that needs to be tended to." @DeniseKShull
"When things are tough and everything is going wrong. It's your drive and passion that causes you to say 'It's lousy now. But we're gonna figure out what to do next.' Without passion you can't take on entrepreneurship!" @DeniseKShull
"Passion can get you really far. It can get you all the way. You need other things, but passion is something you really believe in and want. It's that desire that causes you to push through and figure out what you need to do to get that. It's like rocket fuel." @DeniseKShull
"It's challenging to build to more than one location. When we had three locations, Joe and I were outnumbered. There are three stores and two of us. That's when things got crazy!" Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"It was a lot of learning on the ground. We had an amazing executive chef on the ground, Joe, and he's part of the reason why this is a success story. We were able to build these low footprint locations. We like the little ones!" Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"I feel like for every two successes we had, we had one failure. It's been like that pretty much since then." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"LA style is what we serve. Tortilla, meat, pick your filling, guac and that's it." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"Everyone's afraid. When you're not, then that's when you need to worry! Concerned, doubtful, worried, a little anxious. That feeling is meant to help us and motivate us. Without it, would any of us done anything?" @DeniseKShull
"For me fear was very important, it's what drove me to open the business. I think too much fear makes you not comfortable - and that's when you make mistakes. But having a healthy dose of fear is really great." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"Lately I've been writing things down - what's the problem I need to fix? What are the steps? And then I block everything on the list except the first one." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"It's the basic question of what are you feeling and why and thinking about what you will be feeling and why 5, 10, 15 years from now. If you use feelings in the future, that can be clarifying and motivating." @DeniseKShull
"The reason I picked it was because I was afraid. I was outside my comfort zone. That really motivated me! It seemed like the non-obvious choice, and something about that really excited me." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"I started thinking about what I want to build and then an idea came to the forefront of my mind - I moved to NY to go to film school and realized Mexican food was underrepresented at the time. The idea stuck with me." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"I started at NYU film and worked for Live Stream and became very inspired by the founder there, Max. As soon as I saw the journey of what it's like to build something from scratch, I started thinking I want to be an entrepreneur." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"People operate using their feelings and emotions all the time. Most of the time it's going to be some level of confidence or lack of confidence. Using the words, like 'trepidation' or 'nervous', then you can channel it." @DeniseKShull
"Experience is the key. I've only been in the restaurant game for 4 years. Working in high profile and high stress areas, every year I make better and better decisions. There's no other teacher than experience." - Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"In terms of running our business, if I listen to my gut, I know what to do! Taking emotion into a data point and turning it into an action item. I personally like to run my business that way." Otto Cedeno @OttosTacos
"The human being is one organism. Your body feeds your mind. It's got feelings and senses. The only way to optimize the system is to use all the parts! To be only positive prevents you from using all the parts." @DeniseKShull
"Studies started to show that you have to have emotion to make a decision. But on Wall Street it was 'take the emotion out of it'. So I started talking about it and people reacted because it resonated more with their own experience." @DeniseKShull
"The pressure is to not have your negative emotions. In reality emotions are a summary reaction to what's going on in the world and they have information in them. If you can have your whole palate of emotions you can be more motivated!" @DeniseKShull
A movie theater in New Zealand has banned pajamas, animal onesies, dressing gowns, and dirty “gumboots”(UGGS) in hopes of improving dress standards in the their cinema. Will banning sleepwear help enforce a dress code, what are your thoughts?
Instant ramen company, Nissin, has released a limited-edition fork that masks the sound of noodle-slurping by masking the noise with the sound of a toilet flushing instead. For $130, would you rather hear a toilet flush over a noodle slurp, like or dislike?
Free plastic surgery apps are available in app stores where children can simulate procedures such as liposuction, nose jobs, and lip fillers. Featuring bright colors and cartoon characters, the developers claim their apps are all in good fun. What do you think?
Remember the last time you complained about leg room on a flight? A new seat designed in the same vein as a horse saddle, lets passengers stretch their legs but sit so upright people are pretty much standing up.  But with seats like these, airlines can increase passengers by 20%.

“Parents who have a kid who learns differently, it’s a lifetime journey. I love giving back to the community. It’s a long hard road from schools to the social emotional piece to life after 21. Parents like that the program was started by a parent and child!” @edubeth1 @TechKidsU
“If children are 5-7 we’d give them Scratch, 4-6 we give them Scratch Jr. we dont have a dedicated curriculum. It’s kind of like a playdate where they decide what they want to make or do!” - Avanti Sharma @Workshop4Me
“You can go to sites that are created essentially as Etsy for entrepreneurship! You can shop small and shop the spectrum because we want to employ people with disabilities.” - @edubeth1 @TechKidsU

"My husband and I are both entrepreneurial and we're very involved in each others businesses. I'm a night person, he's a morning person. It can get taxing, but the thing I try to remember is that when I'm at my most tired he's ready to take the baton and sprint." - @veronicawebb
"It's interesting to collaborate with your spouse. I'm just gonna say it's hard." - Amy Smilovic @tibi

"When I started our cosmetics were separate but equal. We had a separate line at Revlon. Now when you look at Revlon adds, the majority of women are women of color. I think business follows the money! Business is shifting to meet the demand of consumers." - @veronicawebb
"To be authentic, I remember the manners my mother taught me. You want to be warm, discreet, and polite. I think that part of staying authentic online is to talk about things I care about! I want people to be left with an encouraging word." - @veronicawebb

"We have so much technology in the palm of our hands and everywhere where their sold you can learn to master your phone. If you don't master it, you're a slave to it. Master your phone! You can write a successful blog off your phone! Don't be intimidated." - @veronicawebb
"My aha moment was when my kids needed a lot of help. I have dyslexia and so do they. So I asked what can I do that I can enjoy where I can be available and flexible? I knew I should write a blog. You tell your own story!" - @veronicawebb
"As a model you have a shelf-life. From the moment you step into the arena you're thinking about your next move. You have to. When I started having kids, I knew that would take me out of the game too. I was looking for my next move!" - @veronicawebb
"I think when I was at American Express I had to get new companies to accept American Express. What that did is it forced me to go through and delivery financial propositions to these big companies and I got jealous. I said I want to do that one day!" - Amy Smilovic @tibi

"One of my favorite things to cover is natural beauty, things that you can either eat it or pronounce everything that's on the label. My other favorite thing to cover is the ascendancy of young black designers." - @veronicawebb

"Tibi is privately owned, we have 95 employees, we've done it ourselves. We like to react to the world in our own terms. It's been really important to me to slow down the process. We have an amazing team and do everything in house!" - Amy Smilovic @tibi
"I feel like one of the biggest changes is that everyone now has a voice, an opinion. Especially for women of color. The internet has done for beauty for women of color what rap did for men of color's voices!" - @veronicawebb
"We moved to Hong Kong and it was where I was freed up to really do my own thing. I took stock of what I was good at, marketing advertising drawing. On the plane there I decided to start a clothing company. I started it the first day I arrived." - Amy Smilovic @tibi
"I started my own blog about a year and a half ago because I wanted to be a part of the digital conversation! I also wanted to be able to work from home, because as women we have to be so flexible to have quality time with our children." - @veronicawebb

"Influencers are individuals that represent themselves as a brand, they're amazing self expressers and lead the trends! Influencers are a core part of sharing how they use our box to style for our customers." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"The world of bots should be folded into the world of automation. You can't have man versus machine. They need to work together in synergy. Bots are ok for simple stuff." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"There's a lot of room for improvement with customer service bots. I'm annoyed about bot interaction, the moment it's obvious it's a bot, it's annoying. What is the fine line between technology and human touch that we can offer to a customer?" - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"Content is around styling for us. People are curious about how to style an item in a way that makes them edgy or classic. Whenever our stylists are curating the pieces, it's content, it has to tell a story." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"Content is not just a b to b thing, we're seeing content that is relevant! It shifts also to content being about how we use the product, best practices, stylists. Too much content is hard because it's not personalized." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"A new trend is the combination of intelligence and automation, combining the elements together is becoming more of a reality." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"If we see that the stylist had a great personal connection with our customer, the next box will be styled by the same stylist. So they have an understanding of and connection with the customer." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"We get more data, since with every box that gets sent and every interaction, whether they loved the box hated the box, all of that information comes back to us. We have quantitative ways of measuring our stylists." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"Subscription is not just the new business model, it's the new form of loyalty. Repeat business is one of the number one metrics that every retailer naturally focuses on. Subscription focuses on that and shifts it into a more services model." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"For subscription it's important to understand for your potential customer, how frequently would they like to use your service? If you're a once a year item, like a luxury watch, there's no need for a subscription service." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"One of the challenges we had is if you're trying to shop - you have to go through 1000s of totally unique items in our shop. Getting that merchandise curated to someone's home where they can try it on, that helps take that friction away." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"The subscription-box model is trying to replicate that physical experience in your home." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"Scarcity is OK because you can see a sample, try it on. But then buy it online. The shipment can be done somewhere else. The physical is becoming more in fit with what the customer wants and choice." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"It's interesting thinking about what the role of physical will be. Physical stores becoming more like a sample store! I feel like more and more this affiliate concept will trickle into the physical space." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"This is one of the trends in the click to brick movement, the anti-traditional movement of stores that are living and born online. How are they attracting customers by having a physical footprint that is flexible? How do you go where your customers are?" - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"The only way to filter out the data is to look at the patterns and see what would be best for them. Focus has shifted from just shopping to repeat business and lifetime value." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"The biggest challenge is happening in physical stores. There's no opportunity to have that touch-point with the customer in a lot of the retail experiences. Our challenge is that we have too much data on the customer!" - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"How do you mix digital and physical together? How do you make sure that someone buys something, it's personalized, and they're happy? Looking at the entire customer life-cycle!" - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"CRM has evolved from being a data-keeping entity to becoming more of an action-oriented platform that allows you to do the right service!" - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"How do you look at all the data that focuses on the customer themselves? That's a layer that you focus on that helps you understand the next action to drive to a specific customer. The main thing missing from CRM is how to capture the engagement!" - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"We have over 20 years of customer service and customer experience and converging them together to build a new modern way where brands can feel connected to their customers and not have a separate service." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"I've done a lot of marketing and I like to think about how is the customer the focus? How do we enhance the customer themselves as the main focus of b to b." - @AlonWaks @kustomer
"Dancing was my way of self-expression and making new friends without having to speak the language. It's the same thing with fashion. There are so many ways we can self-express beyond just communication and speaking." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"There's so much waste and so much of the industry telling us to shop new. But fashion is a form of self-expression not about consumerism. How can we make the re-selling part so easy and fun that it's not a question to be trading in and trading out." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"It was a real struggle! We had no money, we had no office, we were working out of my co-founders apartment. But it was, in hind-sight, one of the funnest and toughest times." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"We felt that while shopping had become so easy and seamless, what do you do after you shop? There wasn't as much of a convenient/fun experience out there." - @rieglobe @materialworldco
"For me it wasn't an easy let's start a company journey. I didn't even know about the option to have your own business until I went to business school in the US. I saw there were so many people who were starting companies and failing, and that's OK!" - @rieglobe @materialworldco
SuperShe Island is a private island in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Finland equipped with spas, saunas, and best of all (or perhaps worst of all) no men allowed. An island for women, like or where can I sign up and donate all my money?
A female empowerment jewelry designer is promoting the woman’s body with her unique 'Hairy Jewelry’ collection of fringed pieces designed to be worn in areas of the body that are traditionally considered unattractive. Hairy jewelry, like or shave it off?
Coca-Cola is launching its first alcoholic drink to compete with other mild low alcohol drinks already on the market in Japan. Sho-chu, plum wine, sake, and now Coke-a Hol? What do you think?
Alexas around the country are creeping their owners out with weird, unexplained laughter, which is downright frightening. Amazon is currently working on the fix. Are our robot overlords hilarious pranksters or is this a big fat NO?

“Our next steps are to expand outside of broadway and be in other US cities and Europe. Once we’re in a large amount of theaters, we’re hoping to go into Cinemas!” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“If you’re creating an accessibility service you want to make sure to be mindful of including people in the community into the development process. You don’t want to create things only for people, but with people.” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“We have to evaluate every child! They have to have the language foundation first, between birth and the age of 7.” - @jsbravin @ASD_1817
“To see the students coming to our school, they often come without any language or communication abilities. When you see how they grow, thrive and change! That’s what inspires me on a daily basis, the impact.” - @jsbravin @ASD_1817
“Some of the misconceptions we’ve come across, people say why do people who are visual or hearing impaired want to come to theater? It’s a basic understanding that all people want to enjoy the same things, that’s one of the biggest misconceptions.” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“I find myself educating people on a daily basis because the ideas change on a daily basis!” - @jsbravin @ASD_1817
“There are apps for people who are visually impaired to guide them through malls and bus stops and buildings! There’s a lot of amazing tech that’s making the world a better space for people who need more access.” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“For me I rely a lot on text, email, and video phone, where I can call you and sign to an interpreter and they translate to you. Facetime is also so important! I can pull over in the car and facetime someone and sign the whole time!” - @jsbravin @ASD_1817
“We have a brand new building that is designed for the education of deaf and hard of hearing people. We have smart boards and tv screens that has people signing.” - @jsbravin @ASD_1817
“Audience members have been supportive because we’ve designed the app to be non-disruptive. It’s been a case of making sure the Ushers know to make sure it’s ok for these audience members to use their phones!” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“We wanna make sure that not only live shows are accessible but cinema as well!” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“It’s important to understand that a lot of the services for those who are deaf or hard of hearing are also useful for other people too! When you make experiences accessible it helps a much wider audience than you may think!” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“With email, tweets, I have access to so many conversations now. Now we need to work on universal designs for all people, deaf, blind, wheelchair accessible.” - @jsbravin @ASD_1817
“When I was growing up there were few captioned TV shows, but now we have access to so much more information. And there’s more coming as well. Next, I wanna see it in cars!” - @jsbravin
“Our whole idea is to be really accessible, is to be availble every performance. We’re not looking to replace ASL translators but it allows flexibility and be able to go whenever they want to go.” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“To have it right on your phone, right in front of you is really amazing! I’m gonna do some testing of @GalaProApp “ - @jsbravin
“We have a control system installed in the theater and it’s installed before the show. All the theater goer has to do is install the app, pick their show, and use it to follow the show in real time!” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“We realized the need for accessibility. It’s meant to be inclusive in everyway for everyone!” - Yonat Burlin @GalaProApp
“These types of successes, like The Shape of Water, show that deaf people can thrive. The attitide and passion has elevated the conversation nation wide!” - @jsbravin
“We’re able to make sure all children can become anything they want to be.” - @jsbravin
For the baby that has everything comes a 24-carat gold-plated crib. With leather interior made from the same material as the seats in Maseratis, this crib costs $200k. WHAT? I can’t even. Can you? Gold cribs —like or dislike?
Another trend lighting up the interwebs is the #HobbyLobbyChallenge where people are using the fake flower aisle to take an array of artsy photos. What are your thoughts?
Avocados are being used for engagement ring boxes now because nothing says ‘marry me’ like browning guacamole. A big trend with Millennials (go figure), the hashtag #avocadoproposal and #avocadotoast are also being used to share the news. Avocados as ring boxes, cool or ICK?
LIKE OR DISLIKE? Now fine scotch is closing in on the gender gap with Johnnie Walker’s release of its newest Black Label addition, THE JANE WALKER EDITION! What do you think?

"I'm concerned about the work force that's being left behind. I have a lot of friends who don't have the skills to compete. Technology is amazing but it's also something that can displace a lot of people and a lot of jobs." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"The biggest trend I'm seeing is doggy day care! It's a big millennial population. If you can offer doggy day care in your building, it's terrific! It makes people happier, and the happier you are the more productive you are." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"Real estate is a slow moving business. So blockchain has enormous potential in our industry!" - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"I'd rather go slow and make the best product for the right people and then you have something to sell!" - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"There are always adjustments and having to listen to the market. I'm constantly listening and learning!" - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"It's not gonna happen overnight. You're not building an app that can accelerate fast. You have to have the stamina and the ability to get in and grind and work hard. It's going to take a long time." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"In the residential area, where people can do VR tours, you can go into a building, see all the units virtually staged, go home, and move the furniture around!" - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"Branding is telling a story and there are so many more efficient ways to do that today than in the past." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"I started to see that individuals and companies could become their own brand and they could tell their own story and create their own content. Companies are blogging to differentiate themselves." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"Building is a product so we have to find a way to give it a brand and a voice in it's own way" - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"What we're gonna start to see is people saying I want to work in a certain branded office building." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"I think it's a deeper dialogue we need to have about education. With all that's going on, are we equipping young kids with the new way to work based on technology and co-working?" - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"I 100% believe that we are making spaces for extroverts only. An introvert needs peace and quiet. I think there's always unintended consequences and we need to rethink it. There's not one-size fits all for anything." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"You see tech hubs and VCs and it's going to all places across the country. Everything is tech now. If you're not embracing it you're going to be left behind. I went to an industry to where I could get more involved in technology." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"You can try lots of things today and maybe have more of a chance to be lucky because things are changing so dramatically" - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"The concept of development is changing too. I know apple is looking to build housing, Airbnb builds housing. It's about the new way people want to work. It's all part of this food, entertainment, work, live experience that's the new normal!" - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"The massive change is in retail and industrial. As more people are going online, we're ordering things to our homes. Stores are going to have to reinvent themselves and logistics is going to have to be closer to your house!" - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"WeWork came in and created a concept that working in an office building should be communal and fun. This generation wants to work differently. You want the tenants to be excited to work."  - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"Offices have created environments where you feel more comfortable working. Real estate is a big industry and it stayed the same forever, and now it's in a massive shift of consciousness and how people are thinking about it." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"We want this new generation of worker to actually come to our office buildings and work. Office buildings are turning more into hotels and amenity spaces." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"Now everything is starting to change now in this category. We try to get the start-ups, they might be doing things in AI, in co-working. We try to bring them to the investment and landlord community." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"When we think of commercial real estate, we think of everything other than for sale housing. Apartment buildings, hotels, shopping centers, office buildings, warehouses and industrial buildings. That's the category of commercial real-estate." - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"I wanted to bridge the gap between those that are building technology and those that will use it!" - @M_beckerman @OfficialCRETech
"PR was something I felt I understood and could be passionate about it. My niche was commercial real estate! Around the late 2000s, I got bored, and the PR industry wasn't changing enough. I wanted to start over and do something I know nothing about, technology." - @M_beckerman
"Things are changing so fast it's important to understand where it's going. When I first started my company, tech actually enabled me to do more with less. It let me be more efficient." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
"I've always enjoyed real estate because I didn't have to sit at a desk. I could be out meeting people and solving problems and being valuable to whatever I was working on." - @JonSchultz_Onyx
AI powered Real Estate brokers??? Real estate tech platform Truss announced its AI-based platform for finding and leasing office space is now available to startups and small &amp; medium sized businesses. Virtually touring spaces without ever leaving your desk...what do you think?
As part of Ikea's new model, it's now offering furniture rental of its home goods. People won't have to spend hours trying to decipher those Swedish instructions anymore! Would you rent your furniture, or would you rather own?
Dutch Railways is helping passengers reconnect with strangers they've met while traveling on trains! The program is called "Heartbeats and it puts missed connection messages on a Tumblr page dedicated to helping missed connections meet. What are your thoughts?
MoviePass is a subscription service trying to bring people back into movie theaters. The average movie ticket is $9. Movie pass allows users to see two movies a month. What do you think? Are subscription services the way to bring people back into the theaters?
Today, I'm going to be discussing commercial real estate technology and how it's Dot Complicated with @JonSchultz_Onyx , Co-Founder of Onyx Equities and @M_beckerman CEO of @OfficialCRETech . Tune in to SiriusXM channel 111 in just 10 minutes!

“We need better mobile wallets for daily use. You could have funds deposited into a bitcoin wallet on your phone and you could use that bitcoin cash.” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“We also need more government regulation. It will create confidence and protection in using cryptocurrency. It doesn’t have to be scary!” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“To make blockchain more mainstream takes education, awareness and improving usability! To reach it’s maximum potential you have to be able to use it at normal stores like Starbucks.” @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“Banks will have to evolve like everything else. Bitcoin doesn’t allocate funds. There will be new ways of doing things.” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“We’ll see governments start embracing their own version of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies aren’t anti-bank or anti-government, they’re about honesty and transparency.” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“Cryptovalley is similar to silicon valley. It became a hub of crypto businesses and tech companies.” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“Imagine instead of buying something you pay for a service, you can start even changing physical goods into a service industry.” @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“This will transform anything you need to track. Blockchain is like a public record keeping system. You could keep track of when music is played in order to pay the song writers and artists!” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“Blockchain will affect all industries. One of the things we concentrated on early is logistics. We can have end to end tracking within every component of a device!” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“We at @nChainGlobal believe we need to scale the network and chain larger so you can have bigger and faster transactions. So bitcoin cash can have a larger scale block!” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“Only the size of a megabyte can get added to the chain, you can only have every 10 minutes a certain number of transactions. A maximum of 2 or 3 transactions a second. So the current chain can’t have the speed to work as a global payment system.” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“When you cap everything, you enable only a small number of transactions, so the ability to grow and become a global currency is constrained.” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“Back in 2010 there was no economic value to bitcoin, so without value someone could attack the chain easily. The whole value of a bitcoin was under a cent. Now we’re talking about thousands of dollars!” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“We’re trying to use research and renovation, work with external companies, and make it safer and easier to use bitcoin.” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“We’re looking to do more complicated things on the blockchain, coming up with new techniques like security innovations. We want people to feel safe in their crypto.” -@JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“Even after years in the space we’re figuring out things to change!” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“It’s not really about manufacturing anymore, we’re going into a world of service industry. We’re going to start needing something like bitcoin and blockchain.” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“Bitcoin changed the game, it allows businesses to really get down to business!” - @ProfFaustus @nChainGlobal
“I encourage everyone out there who’s thinking about what to do next to be bold and take a risk!” - @JimmyWinMedia @nChainGlobal
“I was so excited to have the opportunity to work with @ProfFaustus ! After I saw bitcoin not just as currency but something that will change the world, that’s how I joined @nChainGlobal !” @JimmyWinMedia
Bacon cabernet is now a thing with the Napa Valley Bacon Cabernet Sauvignon  retailing for $140 a bottle. Bacon-flavored wine! Yum or ICK?
A new Scandinavian exercise called PLOGGING is a portmanteau of jogging and the Swedish word for “pick up.” Essentially plogging is jogging and picking up litter at the same time. Eco-friendly exercise!
If you’ve ever wanted to combine your luggage into a baby stroller, BagRider has beat you to the punch with their part roll-on luggage / part baby stroller wheeler. What do you think?
And we’re LIVE! Come join us on @SIRIUSXM channel 111 to hear everything bitcoin with @JimmyWinMedia and @ProfFaustus if @nChainGlobal !
In 15 minutes I’ll be going LIVE with CEO of @nChainGlobal @JimmyWinMedia and @nChainGlobal Chief Scientist @ProfFaustus, discussing how the blockchain is Dot Complicated. Tune into @SIRIUSXM channel 111!

"Having ethical views tied into a food business is really important, it allows you to attract employees. They believe in what we're doing, so they're willing to walk away from promising careers to better understand the composition of meat and build it differently." - Ethan Brown
"It wasn't because I wanted to expand, but it was to reach out. To reach out to fans. We had a lot of people traveling to New York just to come to the bakery." - @DominiqueAnsel
"I made a trip to Japan and met with several companies. It's important to have local partners to understand the local culture, to understand habits and how to do business!" - @DominiqueAnsel
"Tokyo was our second location that we ever opened. It was a time that a lot of people were pushing us to open business all over the world.  I'm pretty conservative and protective of what I've built. I didn't want to do anything with anyone." - @DominiqueAnsel
"Creating new ideas. It takes time, it takes effort, it's painful. It's painful to make it productive and efficient. But it's so rewarding!" - @DominiqueAnsel
"Plenty of things that I've tried have failed. Everything is a process, a process of thinking of an idea and trying it. It's always risky and people look at you like you're crazy." - @DominiqueAnsel
"If we can get the product to the point where it's indistinguishable from it's animal counterpart, people think 'why not'? There are differences, but they are collapsing at a pretty rapid speed." - Ethan Brown
"My first job was in a restaurant, so I grew up in restaurants. I always loved cooking and the hospitality part! It was a dream of mine to open a restaurant and to express myself in more than just a few seconds. To speak with our guests." - @DominiqueAnsel
"We want people to think of this as a plant-based meat. Think about it as progression. It is meat, it's simply made differently. Fitting in with our cultural expectations about meat, including where you buy it, is really important to our brand." - Ethan Brown
"Meat played an enormously important role in the development of our own species. And you layer in the cultural significance of meat, Thanksgiving day meals for example, and there's an enormous emotional culture and recognition of meat in our culture." - Ethan Brown
"I love finding your deepest memories of food and seeing what emotions went through it. The frozen s'mores for instance, I'm French I had no idea what it was! I saw culturally that there's a huge memory in time where every kid grew up doing s'mores." - @DominiqueAnsel
"I get inspired by a lot of things in life in everyday, especially when I travel. I love art and in Japan an exhibit about motion. Spinning and twirling. Food that moves is food that speaks. That was the start of the the blossom hot chocolate." @DominiqueAnsel
"If you're working towards your passion you will endure almost anything to get there." - Ethan Brown
"I looked all over the world for something that would take proteins from plants and reorganize them in the structure of meat. I finally came to the University of Missouri and said this is the right approach." - Ethan Brown
"I think a great way to build a business is to inspire people, create products that are motivating and to get people excited about having them." - Ethan Brown
"I look at this at the ability to solve global issues with one solution. If you can get people to transition to a plant based meat, the implications for human health, climate, and natural resources are very significant!" - Ethan Brown
"I had zero budget for anything. I only had my own ideas and experience to make a difference in terms of my thoughts and my vision for food. This is something that remains important to me. I don't want creation to kill our creativity." - @dominiqueansel
"I wanted to keep on changing the menu and coming up with new ideas. I love creativity and thinking of food in a different way." - @DominiqueAnsel
"I really got familiar with and gained appreciation for agriculture through my childhood. It's something that continues to inform what I'm working on today." - Ethan Brown
"You really don't need an animal to produce a piece of meat. I asked people to focus not on the origin of meat but the composition. When we think about the composition it's amino acids, lipids, trace minerals and water." - Ethan Brown
"I wasn't sure 100% what was going to happen. Going from being a pastry chef to being a business owner. They're two completely different jobs." - @DomoniqueAnsel
"It was always a dream of mine to start something of my own. It's always scary and risky to start something new. I opened a bakery with only 4 employees! I was working all the time - night and day." - @DominiqueAnsel
Time Flip lets you track how much time you spend on different activities. Answering email? Flip to the email side. YouTube? Flip! Gym? Flip! Time Flip has icons on all its sides representing common activities like shopping, eating, reading—even procrastinating. What do you think?
Canada’s senate voted to remove two words from its national anthem ‘O Canada. The bill changes the phrase "in all thy sons command" to "in all of us command” to make the song more gender neutral. Gender neutralizing song lyrics, like or dislike?

"That's when the job of the media becomes much more important. It's our job to step in and to hold people accountable as best we can." - @gabrieldance
"We've put together a team to look hard at technology over the next year. We were taken aback with the elections. There's very little transparency." - @gabrieldance
"The pattern we saw with stolen identity bots, was that the profiles were identical but the account name is just one letter different. Try variations on your own name and see if an account exists with that name." - @Rich_Harris
"Labeling accounts could help. So if there was a way to allow automated accounts on your platform, but differentiate the ones that are good and the ones that are just spam, it might give us an opportunity to clean some of this stuff up." - @Rich_Harris
"It's good that we do have very senior law enforcement people looking into these questions, because for a long time these social media platforms have been self-policing. There needs to be some mechanism to see what's happening inside these companies." - @Rich_Harris
"The ultimate accountability comes down to twitter. If they want to have a platform where you can't tell what's real or fake, when real people having their lives impacted, twitter has to figure out where it stands on this issue of impersonation." - @gabrieldance
"Influencers are kind of micro-celebrities, very well known for a specific type of clothing line, books, music. they're tastemakers and brandmakers. They're paid to tweet about different things. We found a lot of influencer companies buying bots." - @gabrieldance
"A lot of people said they couldn't even get an interview if they had less than 10,000 followers. They're not buying followers to make themselves feel more important, it's affecting their career!" - @gabrieldance
"In a lot of cases the use of these bots does make a difference, it can cause harm in all of these different and subtle ways." - @Rich_Harris
"People either thought they were buying real followers or thought they could get away with it and didn't think twice. It's one of those open secrets where everyone is doing it, so I have to do it too or I'm going to look less important and influential." - @Rich_Harris
"Not all bots are bad, one of the bots is the Big Ben Bot, every hour on the hour it just tweets "Bong, Bong", sometimes it's fun and makes you laugh. But it can be hard to tell if something is a bot or not." - @gabrieldance
"Twitter is a really interesting platform, it's arguably the most open, it allows programatic access. So we could explore the platform a lot more than other platforms." - @gabrieldance
"There have been a lot of stories about the use of bots in political context, but we weren't sure that this story, about people buying bots to make themselves look more important than they are, would resonate. But when it got out, it took people's breath away." @Rich_Harris
"We had politicians, journalists, celebrities, world class athletes, technology people, influencers. We had them buying anywhere from 5,000 to 750,000 followers. When you see someone online with 750,000 followers there's no way you think that's not legitimate" - @gabrieldance
"Our first 10,000 followers were really high quality profiles, the rest were very clearly not realistic accounts. You're going to pay attention at the beginning but by the time you get to the last 10,000, they're very crummy followers." - @gabrieldance
@gabrieldance @SIRIUSXM And thank you!!
"We had a lot of ethical issues around having this account. We never tweeted from this, we never friended anybody from this account, because we didn't want to influence it all." - @gabrieldance
@gabrieldance @SIRIUSXM It was such a pleasure having you on the show! Thanks for the groundbreaking story! Keep up the great work!
"When you search for 'buy twitter followers online', Devumi was the top result because they had used search optimization to make sure it would be the top result when people search for that. Which is how they built their large and impressive client base." - @Rich_Harris
"Devumi has a manhattan address, we discovered there was no such company there. It's the creation of one man who claims degrees from MIT and Princeton, none of which are real." - @Rich_Harris
"We found more than 55,000 accounts that we could trace back to an originating account. The vast majority of those, we can find the original people. It didn't take long to find them, which is terrifying" - @gabrieldance
@EricaDiamond Love it! Thank you so much!! 💋
@adammarx13 @JulieSpira Hilarious! Thank you! 🦕
"A lot of this and the reporting of internet and social media world, involves reporting at scale. Dealing with large numbers of things. We were analyzing tens of millions of twitters bots to find patterns in naming, following and a variety of other things." - @gabrieldance
"We were very interested in looking at the followers we bought to see if there were individuals behind some of these stolen identities, and to find about the the companies selling them and the larger market place." - @gabrieldance
"The issue is a lot bigger than we originally thought, it's a very widespread phenomenon. That's what our investigation really made clear for the first time." - @Rich_Harris
"In this new world of social media, it can be difficult to report on them if you come in saying you're an official reporter at the New York Times. So there was a lot of conversation at the beginning of how we could even conduct the investigation." - @gabrieldance
For those who just can’t be without man or woman’s best friend, comes the Buddy Rider, the first bike seat for dogs. The Buddy Rider can carry up to 30 canine pounds. Bike seats for pets, what are your thoughts?
In the 34 years that Medieval Times has been in business, there has always been a king at the forefront of the show. Now, for the first time, women formerly known as ‘wenches’ are now rising in ranks, replacing all of its kings with queens! What do you think?
Star Wars fans worldwide are taking courses that combine various schools of fencing and martial arts to fight like Jedi knights. Learning lightsaber combat, what do you think?
The Continental in NYC, has banned use of the word “literally” in its establishment, calling the word “the most overused, annoying word in the English language.” Banning hyperbole from bars, extreme or LITERALLY amazing? What do you think?

“We’ve had to follow the eyeballs! They’ve gone to facebook, isntagram, pinterest, not as much TV. We’re more of a digital company now!” - @HarringtonKevin
“I was born in an entrepreneurial family. My father was a restauranteur. He wanted me to be an entrepreneur! He was my first mentor.” - @HarringtonKevin
Wearable tech company E-Vone has created a pair of smart sneakers that can send notifications in the event of an emergency. The shoes learn the patterns of the wearer and can detect abnormal movement and send out an emergency alert. What do you think?
The CEO of PepsiCo tried to fly by an idea of softer Doritos for women because, according to her, women don’t like to crunch their food in public. The idea was squashed by the outraged internet before it could even make it to R &amp; D. What do you think?
China’s police now are using sunglasses with built-in facial recognition to scan travelers’ faces for wanted in major cases. Facial recognition glasses. Creepy or genius?

"The purpose of what we do is to help you connect in the real world. We're software and we write code, but fundamentally it's about human connection!" - @elieseid @Tinder

Dos and Donts "Don't brag about your accomplishments on your profile. It's about painting a picture about who you are and what makes you interesting!" - @sameeraconnects

"Dating and love is such a lucrative business because it's so important to us! If you're willing to go into a bar and drink a cocktail to meet someone, you're willing to spend money on something that matters as much as this does" - @elieseid @Tinder
"College kids are trend setters. When @Tinder became accepted on a college campus, that revolutionized and made it acceptable across society." - @elieseid @Tinder
"There are a lot of professional women coming into Portland because of the new business. But there's a big issue of not having a lot of professional men, but there are a lot of professional women. That's part of why I started a match making business there." - @sameeraconnects
"I've always been a matchmaker at heart! I was always matching my friends when I was younger, giving them relationship advice and coaching them." - @sameeraconnects
"It's engaging and fun! We're taking something fundamentally amazing and complementing it in a fun way. It's not clinical, it feels fun and light weight." - @elieseid @Tinder

Advice to those looking to start their own cosmetics company? “Dream big, but act small. You need a big vision, but you need to start executing with small detailed steps.” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“There are ingredients that are being ruled out, certain chemicals. I personally lean towards the natural ingredients, but then again different ingredients react differently on different people.” - Giorgio Dellacqua @NYSCC
“One of the challenges of the cosmetic industry is I think those trying to come up with their own cosmetics line don’t know where to go first. Come to us! Ask for help! There’s a big chain of command to get into the market. Just dig in and go for it!” - Colleen Daddino @NYSCC
“We were part of a L’Oreal Accelerator, and when you’re trying to raise capital and product, it’s always exciting to be a part of something like that!” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“Indie cosmetic brands have become very successful. Authenticity has a big role. They’re fresher, the ingredients they use are environment friendly and ethical, and the audience connects to them easily.” - Giorgia Dellacqua @NYSCC
“We had a lot of footage of girls using our prototypes and I was able to use those for marketing. That’s how we took off. Through live demonstrations. And then influencers contacted us to market it! It was great validation for the nailbot.” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“There was a need for us to bring experts to discuss cosmetics and to be an authority about cosmetics since there are so many people in the conversation. We wanted to have a clean objective conversations.” - Giorgio Dellacqua @NYSCC
“When you think about ethnicity we think about hair, skin color, different ways the skin behaves. I wish there were more diverse products on the market” - Giorgio @NYSCC
“Once you put your hand in the cradle, your nails are printed in 5-7 seconds! It’s perfect for younger consumers who don’t want to keep their hands still for that long.” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“Find sponsors and mentors and champions who will, when you want to start your own company, really support you.” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“All of the pieces of my background came together to build the nailbot. I want everyone to have a nailbot, and the experience is mobile!” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“Material science wasn’t my background. My background is diverse! But I had a vision to build a tech company for young girls. The nailbot was our first product!” - @preewalia @preemadonna
“In a cosmetics chemist meeting, if there are scientists, they’re very creative and throwing around ideas. It’s also very business oriented! We interact at all different levels.” - Giorgio @NYSCC

“In terms of the beauty industry, I think the US is neck and neck with places like China and Korea” - Colleen Daddino @NYSCC

"We don't want to become slaves to the algorithm. We want diversity in terms of development and in the algorithms themselves." - @mikejcasey
"We're going be moving toward a global currency. We'll see currencies become adopted and the ones that can't handle it will drop out. We're going to see a few that will dominate." - Sean Worthington #CloudCoin
"We're seeing technology come up with systems that say we may not need government regulation as much. This is a question we're going to be dealing with over the next 5 or 10 years as technology allows us to do more things on our own than before." - @paulvigna
"Money doesn't require government to exist. It's much better if they're separated. It introduces currency into the market in ways it shouldn't change them. So having a good stable money system that has integrity and truth is essential." - Sean Worthington #CloudCoin
"I approach cryptocurrency from a scientific view. Money has a fundamental value. There are 694 currencies with the same API. It's a risky time. But you want to master this technology, because it is the future." - Sean Worthington #CloudCoin
"You need to understand what you're buying, you're not buying shares in a company that has steady cash flow. It's not something you can evaluate using fundamental factors for a company or bond. This is an experiment. Don't bet what you can't afford to lose." - @paulvigna
"This is a grand experiment and a fundamental shift in how we think about value exchange. Own something that gives you some level of proxy-exposure to the broad idea. But don't get too obsessed and be ready to suffer losses." - @mikejcasey
"All of these are digital assets. That's the only true word I'd use for all of them. Because the rest are trying to mash these word into something that doesn't necessarily fit this new world we're creating" - @mikejcasey
"It's useful to think about how this stuff is developed over time. It depends on what the utility of that currency is. Bitcoin is aspiring to be a currency." - @mikejcasey
"There's still a huge debate about whether these are currencies or commodities." - @paulvigna
@adammarx13 @mikejcasey Such a good point! Once again the theme of how we build relationships and how we communicate with one another is present on the show!
"We have to economize. Bitcoin isn't going to be around if something comes around that's more efficient. Our monetary system doesn't have to be inefficient like Bitcoin." - Sean Worthington #CloudCoin
"Monetary systems are information systems and they track who's supposed to get what. Once we understand money is data, we can take our data textbooks and apply it to money. Our money has to have truth." - Sean Worthington #CloudCoin
"One of the challenges is nomenclature. What is blockchain? We are in a social zeitgeist of figuring out what some of these things mean. Do you call something that has some of the qualities of a blockchain, a blockchain?" - @mikejcasey
"What human beings to do organize society, bring about civilization, is we tell stories. But we need to figure out what the facts are first! This is a machine that helps us reach consensus. That helps us create a shared record of the truth." - @mikejcasey
"The thing I think is interesting is the waves of mania for cryptocurrency. You see waves of innovation and experimentation and this will not be the last of either of those." - @paulvigna
What's changed in the cyrptocurrency field in the past 3 years? "It's transformative. This technology is the underpinning of a new economy." - @mikejcasey
Film and camera maker, KODAK, is getting into the crypto-game with a $3,500 two-year license for a Kodak KashMiner in a server farm. What do you think?
Since more than half of us already using our tech in the bathroom anyway, Kohler announced it’s Numi Smart Toilet. What do you think? Would you use a Smart Toilet?
Ever wondered what famous piece of art you most look like? The new feature on Google Culture Arts app can tell you. What do you think? Does Google think you look like Mona Lisa or another famous piece of art?

@lifetimetv @leagoldman
“The way we’re portraying women in magazines and TV is always to do with physical appearance, not what we bring to the table not in appearance. Why can’t we have women of style AND substance?” - @ImanOubou @SwaayMedia
“We are in a moment where moms are cool! Moms and daughters are sitting side by side at soul cycle.” - Lea Goldman
“The middle aged woman is as much an audience to look to as the millennial woman! And they’re overlooked.” - Lea Goldman

Thank you to @Adirondackatie, @juliezeilinger, and @adultingcollect for joining me today!
"Recognize what a strength it is to talk about things that are difficult." @adultingcollect
"If you're anyone and haven't collaborated, that's a skill that must be developed. It's going together that we solve these problems." @Adirondackatie
"Find strength in community. There are resources out there. Be open and vulnerable to seeking help." @juliezeilinger
"We offer 'action challenges' because accountability is so important." @adultingcollect
"We don't get any formal training on how to live life. How do you deal with a breakup, how do I sew a button on my clothes?" @adultingcollect
"Our society doesn't handle transitions well. There's no preparation for the real world." @juliezeilinger
"The best way to learn affectively is not be ashamed of the need for knowledge." @adultingcollect
"There's a @TEDTalks about the Paradox of Choice. We can get paralyzed and overwhelmed with big questions and forget about the little stuff." @adultingcollect
"We're moving toward a gig economy because people want to be masters of their own life." @adultingcollect
"We help all people struggling with life challenges that aren't taught in school - particularly for Millennials it's about getting into college without the shop, home-ec, finance classes." @adultingcollect
"I think it's ridiculous that there's a stereotype about Millennials being apathetic." @juliezeilinger
"We will work as hard as necessary. Just watch." @Adirondackatie
"Women's voices are being heard for the first time in a long time. It's about taking that power and running with it." @Adirondackatie
"The @womensmediacntr is about hearing women's voices that are not being heard. 7% of news reporters are female. It comes down to a lot of levels of not being included." @juliezeilinger
"An area like mine still lack broadband. There's no working remotely when you don't have internet. It's all over rural America. It's keeping our economies from flourishing." @Adirondackatie
"I'm fighting ageism and sexism. If I were a man of a certain age in a suit, it'd be a lot easier to raise money." @Adirondackatie
"The economy in a few years will be a mostly gig economy. We need that to find flexible time and value in the workplace." @juliezeilinger
"When we're looking of employing anyone, we have to look at what's going to keep our employees happy and treat them fairly." @Adirondackatie
"We're a generation who feel that we need to carry the torch of the people before us. We're standing up for what we know everyone should have." @Adirondackatie
"There's a lot of freelancing going on. Media companies take advantage of you. We feel devalued. We stand up for ourselves and get called 'demanding.'" @juliezeilinger
"I think we call for change, which can be misinterpreted by older generations. But we're willing to fight for what's right." @juliezeilinger #Millennials
"I see a lot of hope with Millennials. I see a lot of people who approaching everything differently." @Adirondackatie

"We have an editorial board of teen and college students who discuss topical events through a feminist lens." @juliezeilinger
"We partnered with the Women's Media Center." @juliezeilinger

Is cryptocurrency hurting the environment? I wrote on LinkedIn how the explosive growth of the industry and the race to “chase cheap energy around the world” is something to keep an eye on. I remain interested in the space, but like to see all angles. https://t.co/mVKnJ6IYRU

Thank you to my guests @LisaLutoffPerlo @jennifer @MartyNemko for a wonderfully spirited debate about travel vs. staycations!
Is 2018 the year of travel or the year of the staycation?? Weigh in!
"This country is all about strong points of view. It's not all or nothing. I believe in meeting and touching and talking to people in person." @LisaLutoffPerlo
"I think it's all about perspective. Stuff happens that isn't in your control. Sometimes you want to go somewhere and sit in the bathtub there." @jennifer
"Think about the places that are within two hours, or your favorite restaurants, your friends you never get to see, you can cram so much more into a staycation than versus your standard vacations." @MartyNemko
"We need to resist the commercials that seduce into pressuring us to spend our hard earned vacation time when we can have a better experience at home." @MartyNemko
"It is amazing how we can be exposed anywhere in the world for free. There are forums on every imaginable topic. From a bubble bath you can get more diversity online. When you calculate time, money, opportunity costs, you can being doing all this at home for free." @MartyNemko
"When one looks at the reality of people's experiences, people are generally much happier in a staycation." @MartyNemko
"We're always thinking about the planet and how we're affecting the oceans. We're on the forefront of the industry for sustainability. We have a partnership with @WWF and how we do sustainable travel." @LisaLutoffPerlo
"We built our brand as a direct-to-consumer. You have the opportunity to make things right. I wonder if that will extend further into the travel industry." @jennifer
"Around summer, we see a lot more families buying the bag." @jennifer @away
"Our industry has changed and grown so we're incredibly busy all the time." @CelebrityCruise @LisaLutoffPerlo
"The things travelers wanted couldn't be solved in a gimmicky way. People told us their phones died. So we have an airline compliant battery to charge phones." @jennifer @away
"Going back to the very beginning, we wanted to do smart luggage. We looked at many features but they didn't solve a problem." @Jennifer @away
"We have mescal tasting and yoga classes in our brick and mortar stores." @jennifer
"Our brick and mortar store customers are people who want to try out the bag first. Plus the last minute shoppers too." @jennifer
"It was not long after we launched I saw someone going the other way with an @away bag. I never caught up to them. There were at least 8 Away bags on my recent flight to Seattle." @jennifer
"The biggest thing we learned @WarbyParker was that you can build something bigger that incorporates a community." @jennifer
"The luggage I was looking for didn't exist so I made it with my co-founder." @jennifer
"@away came out of a personal pain point. I was traveling and my luggage broke." @jennifer
"@away exists to make travel more seamless." @jennifer
"People used to use cruises to disconnect. Now people want and need to be connected. We invest in the right way that people are connected in the right way." @LisaLutoffPerlo
"We follow trends that are what our brand is known for. We're always following culinary trends, sleep trends, spa trends. We focus on design features." - @LisaLutoffPerlo
"Part of me needs to cocoon and regenerate. The way you spend your time is about balance." @LisaLutoffPerlo
"Game of Thrones has done so many great things for Iceland so we're opening our cruises up there." @LisaLutoffPerlo
"Part of what we try to do here @CelebrityCruise is to open people up to the world." - @LisaLutoffPerlo

"In the first 90 minutes of my day, I've gotten all of my creative chores out of the way [writing, warming up vocally], so that I spend the rest of my day ready if a door opens up." -@alsilbs
@adammarx13 @alsilbs It's never too late!
"Making something that didn't exist in the world until you put it there is the reason for being alive." -@alsilbs
"It's creating relationships that are business relationships and they can be monetized, but they come from someplace real." -@alsilbs
"If it is authentically defined, you can always tell... if it is, the consumer responds to it from an authentic place themselves." -@alsilbs on creating a personal brand
"I found that I wasn't as much as a performer as I am a creative being... for me, my life purpose is about engaging with the act of innate creativity on a daily basis. I was lucky that I found that in writing." -@alsilbs
.@alsilbs just passed her 700th post on her blog she's been writing for over 10 years!

"I had been working my whole life for when those doors opened... when that first door opened, I was ready to not just walk by storm through it. You have to be in this ever-ready position." -@alsilbs
"I always knew that I engaged with the world on a creative level - that I made meaning from the world through creative outlets." -@alsilbs
For us in-studio, a governmental ban is tricky: so many students with different abilities can use screens and technology in the classroom to advance their learning to huge degrees. And shouldn't students learn appropriate use of technology instead of it being banned?
#HotTopic France has recently banned cell phones in classrooms, saying that they deter students' success. Do you think this is a smart move? Should the decision be left to parents? Teachers?
LIKE or DISLIKE? The #TriceriTaco is a dinosaur-shaped taco holder, so you can enjoy your dinner with a friend from prehistoric times!
LIKE or DISLIKE? To stay warm this winter, would you wear a full-body knit scarf? (Picture an enormous leg warmer for your whole body)
LIKE or DISLIKE? @JimBeam is going techy with a smart decanter named Jim, which can pour you a shot when you ask for it. An Alcoholic Alexa or unnecessary tech?

So great to talk with the totally badass @julialandauer on @dotcomplicated today! https://t.co/z18OMP7Tzu
“There’s a misconception in women’s health that the things that change in your body are just things you have to live with. These issue are common, but they don’t have to become your new normal. There are solutions.” -@Estrellajrios of @HelloBwom
“My favorite thing about my job is to walk into a group of men and say the word ‘vagina’ out loud, because they probably never hear it.” -@Estrellajrios
.@HelloBwom closed their first round with 11 female investors, but upon opening up larger rounds, they’ve experienced first hand just how few investors are women.
“From the very beginning of the company, we had a global outlook... so we knew we needed a team that could be spread across the globe.” -@Estrellajrios
“I became really interested in the concerns and health troubles that new moms go through... this is such a taboo topic that many products weren’t reaching people that needed them.” -@Estrellajrios
“We want to educate women about the changes their bodies will go through.” -@Estrellajrios of @HelloBwom
.@HelloBwom gets to know you and creates a personalized health plan, even focusing on intimate and sexual health.
@Estrellajrios @HelloBwom Calling in from Spain, no less!
So happy to welcome to the show @Estrellajrios of @HelloBwom!

“No one is going to be a bigger cheerleader for yourself than you are.” -@julialandauer

Surprise... @julialandauer was also a contestant on #Survivor!
@julialandauer “Sometimes you gotta be bold, right?”
“My dream sponsor is to have a tampon on the side of my car.” -@julialandauer
40% of @NASCAR’s fans are women.

“It’s so cool to get out there and show that the outsider can make it work.” -@julialandauer
Studies show that women can have better peripheral vision and deal with high heat better - so why are there so few women in racing?
“I wanted to get a well-rounded education that would help all aspects of my racing - as a driver, a business person, a spokesperson.” -@julialandauer
“I was really aware that my sport was not environmentally friendly - and it’s not just the cars, it’s everything. I was interested in how to make the racetrack more environmentally friendly.” -@julialandauer
“It’s like a complex 3D puzzle that goes really fast.” -@julialandauer on her love of racing and working with machines
“I definitely always liked speed.” -@julialandauer on riding bikes and go karts from a very young age

LIKE or DISLIKE? Buying your techy BFF a drone for the holidays? They’ll have to register is with the FAA or else you could face civil and criminal penalties.
Could this change in restrictions lead to more competition and innovation for new services and technologies in the wake of an abuse of power? #NetNeutrality
Will this increase the digital divide in this country?
The repeal of #NetNeutrality lifts restrictions that have kept the internet free and equal. Where do you weigh in?

"Because my life has worked in mysterious ways, I'm going to say never say never." -@GretchenCarlson on running for office
.@GretchenCarlson's 2018: a return to television
"America is finally waking up to this issue." -@GretchenCarlson
"One thing I know from being in TV for so long is that usually we move off of stories very quickly... but not on this. That says two things to me: The media is paying attention to it, and the American public cares about it." -@GretchenCarlson
"Maybe the proof will be in the pudding by seeing a women President." -@GretchenCarlson
"Any cultural change takes decades, and that's why I've been so heartened to see how quickly this movement is happening." -@GretchenCarlson
"Look how long it took for civil rights, and we're still fighting that. We may have gone backwards. Look how long it took for women to get the right to vote." -@GretchenCarlson
"Ban together and go to HR and say: we don't want arbitration clauses, we want more women promoted, we want to know what our male colleagues are being paid for the same work." -@GretchenCarlson's advice to young people in the workforce
"Why should I have to change my career because someone else is choosing to do something to me? It's really a man's issue, and the burden of solving it shouldn't just be on women's shoulders. It's on all of our shoulders." -@GretchenCarlson
"When female staffers start working on The Hill, they're told not to get into the elevators with members of Congress. That the elevators are a dangerous place. Are you kidding me?" -@GretchenCarlson
"The men should learn how to behave, and then we don't have to worry about women going to dinners." -@GretchenCarlson
"I decided I owed it to all these women who had never had a voice before." -@GretchenCarlson on telling the stories of other women in her book #BeFierce
"Hire women in more top positions. When you have more women in high positions at a company, guess what doesn't happen? Sexual harassment. Guess what DOES happen? Women are paid equally." -@GretchenCarlson
"The biggest thing men can do is to speak up when they see harassment in the workplace - to stop enabling it." -@GretchenCarlson
"Most men want safe work environments for women. This is not about male bashing at all. There are tons of men out there doing amazing work to benefit women in the workplace." -@GretchenCarlson
"I want to be a part of fixing that." -powerful words from @GretchenCarlson's son to her
"I did it because I saw you do it." -@GretchenCarlson's daughter to her after standing up for herself to bullies at school
"My bill gives women and men who face harassment in the workplace a choice: do you want to go into secret arbitration, or do you want the ability to go into an open court? Imagine what happens then to the power pendulum... it becomes equal." -@GretchenCarlson
.@GretchenCarlson has introduced a bipartisan bill to ban forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts.
"Sexual harassment is apolitical. It's incredibly disingenuous to say: I believe these women because they're coming out against someone I don't like, but I don't believe these women." -@GretchenCarlson
"She was such a badass on the stand. And she was such an amazing role model for our young people who look up to her to say that you do have a voice, and you do have the ability to protect your own body, and nobody has the right to touch you." -@GretchenCarlson on @taylorswift13
"This is what this whole thing is about. It's trying to change the status quo." -@GretchenCarlson on the #MeToo movement
"As more and more women and men come forward with their stories, the shame of this issue is being transferred from the victims to the rightful place, which is the harassers." -@GretchenCarlson
"I had no way of knowing what was going to happen the next minute, the next hour, the next day, the next week... How could I have ever known that all this was going to happen?" -@GretchenCarlson
"One women can make a difference, but together we can rock the world." -@GretchenCarlson's favorite anonymous quote
"If I don't bring this issue to the forefront, who will? And I did it for my children... it was the most excruciating choice of my life." -@GretchenCarlson on her journey of speaking up and taking action
"It was like my entire resume fell off the table." -@GretchenCarlson on others' perceptions of her during her early years in television
"What I think about is incredibly long hours and saying yes to every opportunity. It's so important to raise your hand and say I'm willing to do it!" -@GretchenCarlson on her early career years and advice to the next generation
"I grew up a tomboy. I struggled with my weight my entire life. Pageants were not on my radar at all." -@GretchenCarlson (who went on to be crowned #MissAmerica)
"I get all my tenacity from my mom... I get all my emotions from my dad." -@GretchenCarlson
"It's in giving back that you really discover how whole you can be as a person." -@GretchenCarlson
"I had parents who told me every single day that I could be anything I wanted to be... it gave me my courage to accomplish goals. I was never thought of to be lesser." -@GretchenCarlson
On today’s special episode of @dotcomplicated, catch my interview with @GretchenCarlson, an incredible advocate for women who has inspired millions to speak out against sexual harassment. @SIRIUSXM Business Channel 111 at 9AM PT/12PM ET. https://t.co/wETm6M9QAy

“Ignore the noise. Do what you need to do. And do it well. Find the people who share that passsion.” -@DoctorErika
.@DoctorErika’s #ScienceFromScientists just opened “The SpectacuLAB” at Epcot!
“The system doesn’t adequately train teachers and give them the tools to then go and be successful.” -@DoctorErika
“When you ask a scientist what inspired them to become a scientist... most of the stories come from the elementary and middle school days.” -@DoctorErika
“There are many things you learn: how to speak to people effectively, how to listen to others’ perspectives.” -@DoctorErika on her pageant experience
“Everyone needs to do what’s right for them. How you dress and how you look on the outside should have nothing to do with what you can achieve scholastically.” -@DoctorErika
“There is definitely a stereotype that goes along with being a scientist.” -@DoctorErika is a former Miss Massachusetts, and sometimes even wears her crown when she teaches science
“That’s what made me want to be a scientist.” -@DoctorErika on her school science fairs
“How do you get kids excited about something? You don’t do it by sitting in front of a lecture board and talking to them.” -@DoctorErika

“Look for a niche... find something that is relevant to a particular group of people that is not being serviced to them.” -@polinatravels
“My parents had almost nothing when we arrived. We lived in a one-bedroom apartment... they barely spoke english... They had to figure it out on their own with a family of five.” -@polinatravels
@Lydialyons @polinatravels It’s so true. Sometimes it’s hard to remember in the moment.
“Sometimes difficult things that happen to you turn out to be the best things that happen to you.” -@polinatravels
@polinatravels “I spent the next hour convincing him that we were the team that was going to do this.”
.@polinatravels knew she needed a mentor who knew the industry, so she started seeking out former Greyhound Bus employees
“There’s always new challenges. The challenges become different at different stages of the company.” -@polinatravels of @GoWanderu
“The path of entrepreneurship isn’t 100% success all the time. There’s a lot of failures along the way... everybody’s gone through these tough times.” -@polinatravels

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with two executives from @AlaskaAir who informed me that they are conducting an investigation and have temporarily suspended this passenger’s travel privileges. Thank you for taking this seriously.
@kimberlykhoang @profe_falcon @AlaskaAir Yes that is why, even though I was embarrassed and humiliated beyond words to post this, I felt it was necessary to highlight
@sarahkunst @AlaskaAir @Delta @united Ugh I am so sorry. Though sadly, not surprised
Feeling disgusted &amp; degraded after an @AlaskaAir flight where the passenger next to me made repeated lewd sexual remarks. The flight attendants told me he was a frequent flier, brushed off his behavior &amp; kept giving him drinks. I guess his $ means more than our safety? My letter: https://t.co/xOkDpb0dYU

“My favorite time in the company was when we were under 20 people, small and scrappy, and really just figuring things out.” -@labunleashed

”Representation doesn’t necessarily mean equal equity of power, unless that power is specific.” -@Jon__Jackson
“If you have black executives and they’re only in that Chief Dicersity Officer role... I’m more interested to see who is in a cost center.” -@Jon__Jackson
“Giving people that mix of tactical and emotional safety... you can be inspired, but you also need things you can learn about on Friday and implement on Monday.” -@Jon__Jackson #AfroTech
“We wanted to make sure all of the things - from security to food - to feel communal... you were never in an out group wherever you were.” -@Jon__Jackson of @Blavity and #AfroTech
“The value of encountering ideas, role models... you don’t know what you don’t know.” -@elinder
“Where is the space that we create? Where is the space that we show up, we don’t have to explain where we’re in the room... we can just be?” -@Jon__Jackson
“If you have online resonance, having offline resonance is an entirely different thing.” -@Jon__Jackson
“We wanted black creatives to feel like they had a space for their art to be seen... and to economically support them.” -@Jon__Jackson of @Blavity

About 60% of @Blavity’s content is user-generated.
Welcome to the show @Jon__Jackson of @Blavity, fresh off the second annual #AfroTech Festival in San Francisco!

“Even though computer programming is an area we need to dial up for girls, you can build a career in technology without a computer science background.” -@elinder (who studied 18th century France and Italy)

“Whatever you’re building, launch something and test quickly. Make changes, and repeat.” -@karen_c_lau

“Failure is okay. Think big, but if your idea doesn’t fly, it’s okay. Think again! Try again!” -@elinder

Even though they’re based in Toronto and NYC, @hifurnishr can help you furnish your home and deliver your new furniture to anywhere in North America.
“There’s no guide you get from a new country when you move.” -@elinder, who moved from the US to the UK
On @hifurnishr, you can furnish your entire home... but Furnishr doesn’t hold its own inventory!

"I was a theater major... one of the things I was taught that's always stuck with me is to think about people's incentives and why they do what they do. As a journalist, I think about that as I report stories." -@LesliePicker

One of @LesliePicker's favorite women-led businesses? @StitchFix!

@AmandaWeindel @LesliePicker We're lucky to have early birds like you helping us wake up informed!
@JeanLeggett We've got a LOT to learn from kids! Can't wait to see that - please share it when it's out. Representation in pop culture and media is so so important and influential for young minds.
"The earliest I ever set my alarm is... 3:15 in the morning." -@LesliePicker
How did @LesliePicker learn the world of finance? Reading books, newspapers, and asking questions on the job.

@BloomFarms THC is what provides the psychoactive experience. Now technology allows the industry to make products that can separate out these effects.
Many of @BloomFarms most successful products use CBD, which is the part of cannabis' makeup that provides relaxation.
"It's very important to me that people feel confident in the product their buying." -Michael Ray on the cannabis industry
Some cannabis vaporizer tech can connect to medical recording software so your doc can see how you're using and how it affects your health.

Many believe and studies show cannabis use can have a medical benefit that gets folks off prescriptions - could help solve opioid crisis.
"It's not about that was much as it's about health and wellness." -Michael Ray of @BloomFarms and the cannabis industry

@dohertyjf @HillaryClinton @TODAYshow There's a full video on their Twitter!
@dohertyjf @HillaryClinton @TODAYshow True! And makes a difference between thinking about someone's individual success or experience, as well as larger company culture.
@dohertyjf @HillaryClinton @TODAYshow She discussed the changes in being "liked" whether she was serving under someone else or out on her own.
"We are on the forefront of a change of social perception of cannabis and integrating that into your life." -Michael Ray of @BloomFarms
@dohertyjf "Likeability" is looked upon as unimportant but is incredibly powerful - just this morning @HillaryClinton was discussing on @TODAYshow.

@adammarx13 True - we can push each other to learn more and expand our skill sets. But we want to do it in a way that uplifts the team.
@adammarx13 That's true!!
@Pancakepopple We really need more people in the world like you and doing what you do! Keep at it!

"I have my own personal Board of Directors... different people who excel at different things." -@DebraBednar on where she goes to be coached
"It not only affects how you feel about yourself but how others feel about you." -@DebraBednar on style
.@DebraBednar says a big NO to that old "have a uniform you wear every day" adage. "Style is personal self-expression."
.@DebraBednar says: Ask yourself what your values are, and why! What are your strengths? What do others look to you for?
@ThatVishu Be yourself. Find out what you're an expert on and share what you know.
@Pancakepopple That's amazing!
Do you feel pressure to be liked at work? To be respected? How do these two things interact?

"Diversity drives innovation... you need people that have different perspectives and different approaches." -@DebraBednar
"I think I built a career on what I was good at, and didn't include other dimensions. Women and all people are multi-faceted." -@DebraBednar

"It emboldens you to know that, yes it's hard, but you can get through it if you apply yourself." -@DebraBednar on learning to code

LIKE or DISLIKE? Studies prove that a negative comment on a social media post can ruin a day, while a positive one can make your day.
LIKE or DISLIKE? Pink chocolate comes from the ruby cocoa bean and has a fruity and smooth flavor - time to ditch white or dark chocolate?
