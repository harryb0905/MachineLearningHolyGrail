Just so ya'll are clear I like  @KimKardashian  I was just making a point about how we have used a word and desensitized the real meaning .
It's not her! iwe have allowed it 2 B considered cool, but it still is what its! RT @jaeearly: tru but she doesnt mean it quite so literally
if we want to end slavery we need to stop glorifying the "pimp" culture
Yeah but a pimp is nothing more than a slave owner! RT @_lyricsexpress She may have meant it in the "NEW AGE LINGO" - as in "pimpin" = Cool?
@KimKardashian No disrespect I love a girls night out but a pimp and pimping is nothing more than a slave owner!
