@daprofessor50 Thank You!!
@MrChuckD I’d say that’s true of most black music unfortunately.. other countries have more reverence for it, Soul, Jazz etc. and support the artists longer for sure.

@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag As well it’s disrespectful to Don Cornelius.. for some reason Jeffrey maybe because he’s a Griffey loyalist is trying to inflate his own importance to Don’s Soul Train Records and Don’s vision for the formation of the group. https://t.co/gFh8p4f5sP
@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag I’ve found that in my years starting as a teen .. there is always a level of sexism and misogyny at play that goes unchecked and pervasive media included ..with girls and women being marginalized, discredited etc especially when we can’t be controlled in so many areas..

@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag 1 archived piece on Don Cornelius his own words in 1980.. https://t.co/KwkwMAbwdR
@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag As well a real and ongoing career, achievements with nothing over embellished or made up as a result no reason for a petty/bitter agenda to rewrite history or facts like he/they continue to do each time my name is brought up #enoughisenough
@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag My Mom even had to laugh..was singing Motown, The Beatles, jazz when I was little though very shy.. long before ever meeting Jeffrey..even had my own girl group in junior high.  What a liar fake &amp; phony  🐍 among other things. I try to keep it positive..and ignore this stuff
@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag Absolutely, why not let me speak for myself and actually have more to talk about and not just 35 / 40 years ago..
@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag Exactly

@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag .. he wants unearned credit even  for MJ,  creating a move he was taught himself by true dance pioneers in LA - irresponsible of the writer as well, no one fact checks, does any research .. lazy writing .. Smh what a joke.
@TeeJaines @ClassicPopMag Exactly.. pathetic with each lie and attempts to rewrite the truth and lol he can’t sing so not sure how he taught me 😏was singing and dancing LONG before him , God given talent — also archive interviews with Don on record as choosing me for Shalamar..
@DevoidaTaste @ClassicPopMag He did NOT lol what a joke  as well it was Don Cornelius who asked me to join Shalamar not Jeffrey smh it’s a shame people say whatever with zero integrity or accountability. I was singing before I met him starting with jazz. So tired of these lies and revisionist ‘fake news’.

@ArTallks Thanks so much!! Here’s to a great start to the week✨🎶
Wishing everyone a positive and productive start to the week!
@KickAssIndieJam @SRL_Official Very nice  write up and back story 😊-To clarify though - Jody Watley ft SRL @SRL_Official is a new group (3yrs) creating our own niche, identity and fresh vibe not wanting to be Shalamar..we don’t want that baggage or misperception. Thx so much for support! #JodyWatley #SRL https://t.co/OncjqkX3RQ
@KazGabay @LizsScribbles I just followed her
@KazGabay @LizsScribbles That’s really cool that’s she has sketched your workshops! What a great idea to have her do that!
@KazGabay @LizsScribbles Love it!!! One of my early childhood loves beyond music was fashion illustration and I still sketch as a hobby so I have a great appreciation for it as well.
@KazGabay Very nice article, enjoyed her perspective.
