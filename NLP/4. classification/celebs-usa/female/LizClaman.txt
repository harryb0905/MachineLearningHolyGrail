Charlie Munger: What really wasn't fair was the Fed keeping rates so low for so long, hurting older savers. "But it benefited Berkshire shareholders so we're all undeserving people and I hope we continue to be so." #BRK2018
Buffett on long bonds: "They're a terrible investment. Basically at these rates they're almost ridiculous to think about. Most of our cash holdings are in bond durations of 4 mos." #BRK2018
"First major diss by @WarrenBuffett of one of his subsidiaries: "From a profit stand-point, @Duracell is underperforming. It's not earning an appropriate amount." #BRK2018
"Keep the faith" in $BRKA stock after we're gone...you'll do worse if you sell" Charlie Munger on whether to hold or sell Berkshire after he and @WarrenBuffett 'leave.'
On @NRA &amp; guns stocks, @warrenbuffett says he wouldn't stop #BRK2018 from investing in gun stocks, or refuse to write insurance policies for @NRA members: It's up to shareholders. "I don't believe in imposing my political views on activities of Berkshire."
Charlie Munger: "conditions in steel (prices) have become almost unbelievable".. adverse to the US. Even Donald Trump can be right on some of this stuff. "  @WarrenBuffett told me this a.m. steel prices are spiking for his businesses, he's hearing from all his managers
t'is a circus! https://t.co/Q7bxSebbYZ
On #BRK2018's partnership w/ @jpmorgan  &amp; @amazon to fix healthcare costs for employees, provide better care at lower cost: "The resistance will be unbelievable. If we fail, at least we know we tried."
Warren Buffett tells huge #BRK2018 crowd that his 2 hand-picked investment guys, Ted Wechsler &amp; Todd Combs are getting calls to make transactions. WB not involved w/that anymore. Folks, he's making it clear IMO that a massive transition at this company is well underway. #BRK2018
.@warrenbuff to @FoxBusiness: none of the 61 $BRK business CEOs/managers report to him anymore. Now he's saying to crowd: "I can't tell you the price per pound See's charges anymore."
Regrading Berkshire's scandal ridden @wellsfargo position: #CharlieMunger on how big mistakes make a company better from a moral standpoint: "Harvey Weinstein has done a lot for 'improving behavior too.'  #BRK2018
I told @WarrenBuffett this a.m. before the meeting the @WellsFargo multiple scandal(s) are making shareholders upset. BRK owns billions in  $WFC. Will he sell? He said, "We'll be in it for a long time and we'll make a lot of money."They'll clean it up." #BRK2018

How is THIS fair? Foreign cars coming into US: 2.5% import duty.  US cars going into Europe ? 10% tariff.
BREAKING: @CommerceGov SEc'y Wilbur Ross to FBN: "Trade tariffs" will only be lifted if a country proves its exports to US won't hurt our security, and that includes employment."
BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump reportedly pushing staff hard to unveil official steel/alum #tariffs policy TOMORROW. 3pET, I've got Commerce Sec'y Wilbur @SecretaryRoss LIVE: WHEN, and WHAT will the tariffs look like? Waivers for US allies?
