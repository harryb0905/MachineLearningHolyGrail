It's pretty much a girl project, the director of DUMPLIN' is a woman and Linda Perry produced the soundtrack... it's just a lot of girls! We didn't realize it was like that. It just so happened to be, so getting to sing with all these gals was great, too! #DUMPLIN https://t.co/8kocQFY0Jb

Hey y'all! Hope to see you soon- there's a tour and album a-brewin'... ;)
I’ve got all I need, Jesus and gravity! :)
I'm old enough and cranky enough now that if someone tried to tell me what to do, I'd tell them where to put it! ;)

Show business is a money-making joke. And I've just always liked telling jokes. :)
You'll never do a whole lot unless you're brave enough to try. :)
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever, you know we'll always be together, you and I! :)
I hope people realize that there is a brain underneath the hair and a heart underneath the boobs! ;)
I look just like the girls next door... if you happen to live next door to an amusement park. ;)
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look... Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book! ;)
The magic is inside you - there ain’t no crystal ball! :)
My love for you is deeper than the depth of any ocean and as faithful as the stars that grace the night... :)
My heart is absolutely broken. George Jones was my all time favorite singer... http://t.co/it9arwCPal
If you don’t take the reigns, it’s going to stay the same. Nothin’s gonna change if you don’t change it! :)
Dreams are of no value if they're not equipped with wings!
Don’t let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that I’m as shallow as I look ‘cause I run true and deep! :)
The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain!
Above the storm, the smallest prayer will still be heard.
There’s a great new world out there for those who dare to claim it... A better day is on the way and only you can change it!

I make and break my own records.
Christmas blessings to everyone! :)
I've been writing serious songs ever since I was 10 years old. And even before that, I was makin’ up stuff.
I don't know what kind of a legend I am, but if being around a long time makes you a legend, then I guess I am! :)
Everyone has their own ideas of how they look best, and in my world, I always wanted to be glamorous. :)
I just love people who are bold enough to get out there and do what they do and do it without fear.
In case you missed it... watch me (and my friend 'Kermit The Frog') sing "Islands In The Stream" on @GMA! :) http://t.co/fanTkSlb

Happy Thanksgiving, ya'll! What are you thankful for this year?
Without a doubt, songwriting is my greatest source of joy and the best outlet for my creativity.
I know I have a gift that God gave me, and nobody can take it away.
Show business is a money-making joke. And I've just always liked telling jokes. :)
If I’m comfortable with me, you’ll be comfortable with me.
Put a little glamour into your Halloween with a special discount on all shirts in the official Dolly merch store! http://t.co/3kOeAnly
I’ll keep climbing, I’ll keep climbing.
The way I deal with the joy and the sadness of life is to write about it.
I feel glamorous on the inside, so I want to look like it on the outside.
I was told everything I know, so why not share it with others?
I'm very excited to be working with @IGTNews with my very own video slot machines - Wanna play? Well, come on! http://t.co/grmypnjL
Everyone knows I love Nashville, and I hope the work we've already done will spark more family entertainment in Nashville.
Yeah I flirt - I'm not blind and I'm not dead!
Hone your skills, sharpen your wits, write those songs, and learn to play.
I never wanted you out of my life, and I’ll never say goodbye.
My brothers used to throw us off of the cliffs at our old swimming hole, so you kids be careful out there!
Ever since I was a little bitty kid, I could just rhyme everything. It was always fun, and it just kind of carried on over the years.
You’re supposed to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.
I do not sit in the seat of judgment. I love people for who they are. We're all God's children.
I hope people realize that there is a brain underneath the hair and a heart underneath the boobs.

No dream you can’t accomplish. No mountain you can’t climb. So, activate your love and faith. You can change.
If you don’t take the reigns, it’s going to stay the same. Nothin’s gonna change it you don’t change it.
The magic is inside you. There ain’t no crystal ball.
Don’t let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that I’m as shallow as I look ‘cause I run true and deep.

An Evening With…Dolly continues to glitter on and off the stage by going GOLD!! Thank you everyone for your support!
I can't believe we've lost another wonderful singer. Donna, like Whitney, had one of the greatest voices ever...
If there's a heaven, I hope to hell I go!
If you talk bad about country music, it's like saying bad things about my momma. Them's fightin' words!
If you see someone without a smile, give 'em yours! :)

I wish I could stay 21 forever.  Don't we all?  But I won't ever be old in my heart or in my mind.
You'll never do a whole lot unless you're brave enough to try.
Looking forward to my new @CrackerBarrel release: An Evening With...Dolly! Find out more @ http://t.co/g8lnQoUb.
I think that all creative people are a little bit nuts.
My music has taken me everywhere I've been & everywhere I'll go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records.
To me, obligation is not love. Letting someone be open, honest and free - that's love. It's got to come natural and it's got to be real.
Additional statement from Dolly re Whitney Houston: http://t.co/EYEJggaP
