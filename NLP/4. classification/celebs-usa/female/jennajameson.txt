Special place in hell for these kind of people. 👏🏻 https://t.co/MpFoiEn4lU
@maddiebrambles @duh_dee It IS my place to fight for innocent babies that can’t fight for themselves. Period. If you’re ok with murdering your baby, I pray for your salvation.
@maddiebrambles @duh_dee So a child should lose its life because a person is careless? You are 19. You have zero knowledge of life.
@maddiebrambles @duh_dee Maybe research.  There are doctors in jail for murdering full term babies. Seriously stop believing what makes@you feel comfortable
@maddiebrambles @duh_dee Wrong.

@AlwaysVoter Yes it is true. This isn’t about the Bible. This is about mercy and protecting babies
@Stuart0015 Amazing how people don’t realize the methods borrion clinics use to murder babies.
@The_Real_Rosey @BrealonGod Good luck in pergatory, demon.
@The_Real_Rosey It’s a baby, not a fetus.
@The_Real_Rosey @BrealonGod So murder it? Rather than a peaceful passing bewitch comfort care? You’re a monster...
@The_Real_Rosey A mother who murders her child.
Ghoulish https://t.co/GIUeBs5dWa

@ooh_stephanie Wrong.
@AbbyJohnson Thank you Abby 🙏🏻
@AraeEnlightened It changes when you feel your baby moving and responding in your belly. I agree with you wholeheartedly.
@duh_dee Well we disagree.
@duh_dee I suggest you do research on late term abortion and how, quite often the poor child lives through the barbaric procedure and is left to die.
@duh_dee This is patently false.
The fact that democrats choose to let little babies die alone and cold after being ripped from their mother’s womb should turn everyone to conservatism... or in the least #ProLife https://t.co/L9ucw2c1cJ

@PrinzPlaymates @RealAlisonPoole That was a completely fabricated story. Like most of what the Daily Beast reports. ♥️
@Who_dat_jelleh @JamilkaJs @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Admit it. You got owned. Sit down child.
@Who_dat_jelleh @JamilkaJs @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Not a valid argument. Kinda like your edges.
@thtsomebody @FatimaSHusain @Luap2112 @octoberctw @Joy_Villa What is the currency of Palestine?
@D1Pops Ok, I’ll give you a biology lesson. Sperm are not children since conception has not taken place. Second, you’re attempt defaming me is unoriginal and quite sexist on your part.
@Mr8rightsid3 @LANURSE1 My past career does not dictate my stance on abortion. Everyone needs to stand in defense of the most innocent.
@FatimaSHusain @Luap2112 @octoberctw @Joy_Villa FYI there is no such place as Palestine.
@1776PatHenry @octoberctw @FatimaSHusain @Joy_Villa Truth
@1776PatHenry @octoberctw @FatimaSHusain @Joy_Villa Oh shit he just got owned.

@IamShawnWilliam @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain I think you secretly love “Beckys”
@IamShawnWilliam @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain And you, son, are a sheep. A little boy with blinders on to the true issues of the world. Get on my level of woke.
@ClatisC @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain You read one blurb and now you know my whole political reasoning and drive? Oh you psychic psychic 👏🏻
@IamShawnWilliam @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain You copped out with that reply. Level up. Son.
@FatimaSHusain @GeorgiaDawg1773 @Joy_Villa Please educate me why it matters? I know of a lot of musicians because of their political affiliation but cannot. Name a song of theirs. Whats👏🏻your👏🏻point👏🏻
@ClatisC @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Your point being?
@FatimaSHusain @GeorgiaDawg1773 @Joy_Villa Who cares? Your arguing a moot point. She is relevant because she’s trending on twitter. You attacking her career makes you look desperate and quite frankly, ignorant.
@shantitheman @Joy_Villa Not on your best day, bro.
@alzelms @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Omg you’re about as dumb as the day is long. It means started from the bottom as an average person. 🤦🏼‍♀️
@HelenLuvsVSPink @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Fair enough. Let a hoe live.
@bosnianbabe89 I have their attention.
@Pecker_Grabber @ryanmc003 @Joy_Villa That’s a whole lotta labels, my friend.
@IamShawnWilliam @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Why resort to calling me a “Becky” . Why not just call me a kike because I’m a Jew?
@alzelms @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Selling my grassroots company for 30 million wasn’t “easy”. Your statement wasn’t even clever let alone original.

@TheOrlandoM @Joy_Villa No one cares, bruh.
@alzelms @Joy_Villa @FatimaSHusain Relevance is relevance, ma’am.
@tristinnnnnnnnn Last time I checked Joy is black AND Latina. So she can’t have her views because they aren’t YOURS? FOH
@TheOrlandoM @Joy_Villa Your mom has that cornered.
@smclellanduk @Joy_Villa Listen, I go off character not religion. Joy is a good woman. Period.

@BartMcCoy5 @Str8DonLemon You should use that intelligence to realize you’re attacking a woman of faith that supports our president.
@CalvinLawrenc Be better.
@BartMcCoy5 @Str8DonLemon So because I have tattoos my IQ is automatically lessened? That idea in and of itself shows you’re not intelligent.
@BartMcCoy5 @Str8DonLemon You literally encompass everything that is moronic. I speak about infanticide and you target my tattoos? Plz delete your life.
@CalvinLawrenc That is pure ignorance
I am a woman. I have choice. I choose life. I never considered abortion, because I knew it was against everything I believed. Please take time to consider giving the gift of life to your baby. I know it can be scary, but reach out. Please.
@CaraCrass Closing*
@CaraCrass You’re naive if you think that’s true.  Losing your eyes to the reality is turning your back on these beautiful little lives.
@TKintheSFC 👏🏻♥️👏🏻
This in no way makes killing babies in the third trimester ok. You can attack my womanhood all you want, I will forever fight for the most innocent. https://t.co/2kO77hnckJ
@CaraCrass If it’s passed then it’s not murder. Then it’s just still birth. Stop pushing to murder our innocent.

@originalsavman A comeback to Twitter, bro. Calm your tits.
I want to clarify why I’m leaving. My sobriety and faith are the most important things to me. I am being attacked for my faith. Being Jewish. I must protect my love for G-d above everything, my sobriety and strength stem from him and his grace.
Alright I’m taking an indefinite break from Twitter. It’s near impossible to just have normal conversations without hundreds of people attacking me for the past I cannot change. 👋🏻

@SaneCalifornian Because I think it’s a weak argument, nd something men use to gain ground.
@SaneCalifornian I was referencing his attempt at shaming.
@papajohnilduce @Andrew90049 @bradcooney1 @L8NitePoker You’re a fan.

@Andrew90049 @bradcooney1 @papajohnilduce @L8NitePoker I love white knights.
@rtwingl Not tru, but so? What does that have to do with anything?
@CarmineSabia It’s quite shocking the amount of hate I deal with because of my past. So many can’t seem to see the beauty of my sobriety, motherhood and faith.
@LXaralambos Well my question wasn’t about tattoos. He man I referenced said woman of a certain age are unloveable. I was directing the tweet to HIM
@LXaralambos So because I have tattoos I am undeserving of love?
@AlzubaidiTyrone Bwahahahahaa. True
@Native_Israelis @ramzpaul There is no such thing as Palestine.
@SaneCalifornian To be shamed you have to value that persons opinion. Kek on bro.
@KellyClareBabi Truth
@LXaralambos I’m not here for your approval, sir.
@JoshLBarnett It’s disheartening sometimes, but then there are great guys like you that show us that not all men are alike ♥️
@ramzpaul I expected more from than just slut shaming. Yawn.

@Etown_northside @FaithGoldy You’re *
@AceG32 I wonder how the children that were raped felt. Wonder if they would think my comment was pointed? Pick your side, my friend.
@AceG32 When a moronic bluewaver argues religion, quietly defending a pedo Pope. Welcome to 2018.
@AceG32 The Romans crucified Jesus.
@A5toA2 I pass on being preached to by a baby raper. But if that’s your thing, you better pray .
@LDolts @WeekendBuilder8 Um
@WeekendBuilder8 Figure out who’s side you’re on before opening your mouth.
@WeekendBuilder8 Bwahahahahaa. A sensitive iceback that claims he’s a conservative. Then attacks another conservative for attacking child rapists. You’re outing yourself, BRUH.
@WeekendBuilder8 You’re Canadian you may as well be. Fuck off bruh.
@Evergreenestats So in order to be against raping children, you need to follow the same religion as the offender? Literally shut your boca.
@WeekendBuilder8 Way to attack my character, for calling out disgusting pedos.

@JackieHarpold Oooh congrats on studying agriculture. I guess the whole organic movement is bullshit because you say so huh?

Calling out supposed pedophiles, outs a lot of pedos that are all to willing to defend that sick lifestyle . #StayWoke
@K_Peeezy @rainnwilson Trying to shame me for my past addiction doesn’t make his child rape jokes ok.But you just outed yourself.
@MrAlphaShacks @MedCannabis101 @rainnwilson You sure are putting in a lot of passion and emotion into defending pedo jokes.
@brexoadams @JaneBurgessAZ @rainnwilson Exactly
@pointlessprayer @rainnwilson I was gang raped as a child. I don’t find it funny. But go ahead and try to shame me into accepting it.
@Arvandor593 @rainnwilson Your bio says it all. Gtfoh
@RedWineTCO @MrAlphaShacks @rainnwilson I am one of them. It’s NOT funny
@pointlessprayer @rainnwilson True... but those who chose to make light of raping children choose this scrutiny.
@marvelous_lie Exactly
@MrAlphaShacks @NoRestrictions @rainnwilson Ok, bro... I didn’t @ you. So go support your local pedo comedian and leave me tf alone.
@MrAlphaShacks Stop defending a man that thinks raping kids is funny.
@SimonHother @rainnwilson Your defending a person who jokes about raping children.
@SimonHother @rainnwilson Because porn equates to raping babies? Wtf
@Arvandor593 @rainnwilson Grow up and find child rape jokes funny? Not gonna happen you apologist.
@MrAlphaShacks @rainnwilson Fuck off pedo lover
Please explain @rainnwilson ... another sick undercover pedo animal. When will you people realize this isn’t funny. Stop trying to normalize raping children. https://t.co/mIoqP4WvOH

@maxxlean @KristinBoymom Your weak ass jaw line tells me otherwise.
@GloryGloryyTHFC Actually you’re wrong. Both work.
@maxxlean @KristinBoymom Oh stfu bruh.
@Ralphdoesdallas Gotcha.
@CrescendoCove If all that were true, which it is not... it’s still is nowhere close to being a pedophile.
@mrjeffjackson So you think sex with boys is just “sex” ? No, it’s called rape.
@Ralphdoesdallas Your mom cared, when I paid her for her services.
@PonyGinuwinemp3 🤨
@Retroact1ve Yes.
@ThomasCosta19 He just ravages little boys. FOH
@MeganDWeber23 You got owned, sweetie. Take your L and learn to not fuck with the big dogs.
@darksn4ke That’s a deal, my friend.

@Ralphdoesdallas @angie_eeee Because it fits your narrative.
@MeganDWeber23 The point is, people are more outraged by Trump than an admitted pedophile.

@darksn4ke @BryanKemper But simultaneously rioting and assaulting people for exercising there freedom of speech at a Ben Shapiro appearance.
@BryanKemper An alarming amount of people relish people at their depths of despair, and refuse to acknowledge let alone celebrate those people when they rectify their lives.
@xrotorgirl @BlunderBusket @michaelianblack Stick to cosplay grandma.

@CrushonIvy Excuse me?
@SuperfluousApo2 @PaulScotAugust @TubbyRedLeader @AndrewMaddox4 @Mrloserpunk21 But joking about something so horrendous is how pedophiles try to normalize their crimes.
@JaySoko @BrianJCFleet I don’t want to understand joking about raping a ten year old.
@PaulScotAugust @TubbyRedLeader @AndrewMaddox4 @Mrloserpunk21 Funny you know what they jack off to. Creepy

@sriv06 You’re moving the goal posts.
@FrankDarko88 Is that a threat?
@MericanDaddy Listen. This man made hundreds of tweets talking about his love for hurting kids. I don’t care if they are jokes. I 👏🏻 don’t 👏🏻 care👏🏻 I will speak out it. Don’t like it? Fuck off!
Wow... just wow. https://t.co/u7q6ybKX4v
@Aug_jarod It’s like, SO funny. I bet you had a deep laugh at his jokes about raping infants. 👍🏻
@thoughtpedia @pusbult I did.
@ghstofperdition I quite enjoy it. It’s called consent and being of legal age, bro.
@Sassyfaction @BrianJCFleet It started with the obama administration, and is being fixed by the current administration. Bye
Look at the balls on this beast. https://t.co/piRRr4IMfr

@Vilijijit Ad hominem.
@Mrloserpunk21 Nice try. Barely legal is LEGAL. Trying to deflect from someone joking about actual rape of infants says a lot about you!
@Vilijijit Oh you’re Canadian. Figures.
@BrianJCFleet I’m angry about any child being hurt.
@gfling @pusbult I have been VERY vocal about anybrape depiction in porn as being wrong and should be illegal.
I think everyone should read the comments here. It’s frightening howSO many can normalize jokes about raping babies. Then, go on to trivialize the fact that I was gang raped as a child. #sickpeople https://t.co/Ogjwl1Fc5i
@benjamincost If you choose to joke about raping babies, you choose to be lynch mobbed.
This is frightening. https://t.co/NoDux399gW
@pusbult Pornography is legal consenting adults. Consistent, systematic tweeting about raping children is disturbing. The fact that you don’t see that is odd.
@Vilijijit Victim shaming
@BlunderBusket @michaelianblack Adult sex is not compatible to child rape.
@IstankaDrumpf @michaelianblack How am I terrible?
@Monie625 @TheLegofThanos @michaelianblack Pornography is not pedophilia
Please don’t conflate legal pornography with the rape of innocent children. I was raped as a child and you strike me as a clear and present danger. My only regret is not putting my  rapists in jail. I pray you arent the pedo your tweets elude to. https://t.co/tf3qtAn3jf
@al5252 Are you actually victim blaming? I was gang raped as a child you utter monster.
No, it’s because making pedophilia and child rape jokes doesn’t go over well with non-pedos. Get help you sick f*ck. https://t.co/xEBPFnsKdS

@TheTexasLisa @KingHeathcliff @TheGillianKelly That’s all you’ve got? Poor dumb thing.
@TheTexasLisa @TheGillianKelly @KingHeathcliff You’re not very good at this. I told you maybe to rethink your idiotic bio. You got defensive instead of taking constructive criticism.

@Nicks2007mom Sweetheart you’re putting words in my mouth. When did I say not to vaccinate? I asked a simple question about the government mandating vaccines. I never stated my opinion.
@ohyeaaaaaaaaaah I understand the reasoning behind vaccines. Lol. My question is about making something like this mandatory.
@The_GodParticle @Nicks2007mom @nighttrain207 @WhiskeyTangoSci @JimHill85404257 @WhitneyChirps Actually calling people idiots and assholes is the very definition of ad hominem.
@Nicks2007mom When a mom says my child has autism and he’s fine 🤦🏼‍♀️
@Nicks2007mom @nighttrain207 @WhiskeyTangoSci @JimHill85404257 @WhitneyChirps Ad hominem doesn’t build your case.
@Know_ur_nature @JasonVesper Here’s a perfect alternative... birth control or even abstinence. Omg maybe even adoption. The fact that murdering your child is something you fight for is scary and shows your moral character.
@davechanedm @mccreary_clay I make people think and research. If everyone just falls in line, then where will we be? At the mercy of the government. Open your eye 👁
@Know_ur_nature @JasonVesper You ruin your own argument by trying to attack my character. Bottom line... killing the unborn is wrong. It is a crime against humanity.
@TakeThatToxins Ok government funded propaganda generator.
@JoSantisteban My good friends child died after his MMR vaccine.
@Nicks2007mom @nighttrain207 @WhiskeyTangoSci @JimHill85404257 @WhitneyChirps How terribly insensitive of you. This person is talking about their injured child you utter asshole.
@PromiseRW So you think mandatory vaccines for everyone punishable by law is a good thing?
@Rivet_Gun That wasn’t my question.
@davechanedm @mccreary_clay So ignore it fuckwad.
@Know_ur_nature @JasonVesper Talk about deflection. Trying to strong arm people’s emotions all the while gunning for the death of the unborn is sick.
@mistermagnet Neither can toddlers, should we murder them at will?

@KyleMong There are many reasons... religious , moral, and sometimes fear. I suggest doing research.
@indthinkers The fact that you are unphased by dead babies, shows your moral fabric
@tishboothill Beautiful.
@GerrardN8 @mccreary_clay Actually vaccines go against some people religious and moral beliefs.
@GerrardN8 @mccreary_clay Why does israel have a lot less vaccines for babies?

@nabuccodenazzar @kialo @dougsterling1 Directly related to the MMR vaccine.
@renodorrall I am neither here nor there. I don’t know enough about it to make an informed decision to be honest.
@dago_guinea I somewhat agree. But just because YOUR children are ok doesn’t mean that kids aren’t injured or killed by vaccines.
@LuckyLiberty77 Exactly
@renodorrall I don’t believe in following groupthink.
@isshapcha Oh fuck all the way off.
@LeonidasHugh89 Children with autoimmune disease shouldn’t be in public schools... my opinion.
@_DrLeoSpaceman_ @sdx76 @smartgirls4gop Key word fetus
@JoshLymen @JimHill85404257 @WhitneyChirps Shut up you moronic iceback.
@WhiskeyTangoSci @JimHill85404257 @WhitneyChirps My close friends son died after the MMR shot.
@renodorrall Well then vaccinate against those mutations like the rest of the sheep.
@marcelom_matias I have a close friend who’s child died after the MMR vaccine.
@nabuccodenazzar @kialo @dougsterling1 Wait... be careful. Parents have lost their children. Your reply sounds terribly insensitive.
@ohthatbethany I’m busting balls.
@mccreary_clay What a bout the children that die or are injured because of vaccines?
@RealJamesLeedy @Tazmancook @GVallaris Being a fat Ass is way worse for you.
@TA9463 @SEAGena @Pauls_Spare_Rib @KamrynsOnFire @RiaLovesPawlish I agree
@ohthatbethany So non mandatory vaccines don’t save lives?
@Pauls_Spare_Rib @KamrynsOnFire @RiaLovesPawlish Well if you vaccinate your kids, they shouldn’t be affected... right?
@nabuccodenazzar @kialo @dougsterling1 You can’t tell me you’ve never heard of #vaccineinjury
@permanentnick Fair enough.
@JulieLvsPACKERS I don’t think it’s your job to “get” them. I think freedom constitutes choice. Especially medically. I mean, for some people it goes against their religion. Also for a lot of pro lifers, it goes against their beliefs since vaccines contain aborted fetal cells.
@marcelom_matias Why are you saying please to me? I just asked a damn question.
@PDubites Do you think vaccines can cause death, or injury in some cases?
@WhitneyChirps @ErikaSmith1921 @JimHill85404257 This is why I asked the question. 👍🏻
@msiraldo @lolo_coco Aborted fetus cells!
@PDubites It’s very hard.
What does my hair color and former occupation have to do with my intelligence? https://t.co/EMi7iliP2l
@renodorrall Well if your child is vaccinated, why worry?
@Jno_Aubrey Exactly.
@renodorrall Well if schools only admit children with up to date vaccinations, that isn’t a problem.
@PDubites Understandable, but as a nurse you know those sicknesses aren’t fatal, right? Also... why are there sooo many more vaccines for children I. Comparison to the 79s and 80s? Also, are you up to date on all these new vaccines? I’m certainly not.
@Tommy29gun San Fran Cisco is a cess pool of disgusting immoral morons.
@JimHill85404257 @WhitneyChirps Ever see a child seizure and die from the MMR vaccine?
@lolo_coco First of all ma’am, I just asked for others opinion. I never stated mine.
@sdx76 @travlecrazy @LibertyRetort Not here to argue, just to hear others views.
@WhitneyChirps Or if the government is feeding us falsities about the rise in polio in order to keep money pouring to big pharma.
@sdx76 @smartgirls4gop Rubella is not fatal.
@TexasMom1836 @faustin_don Reading is fundamental.
@LeonidasHugh89 But if your child is vaccinated, why worry?
@lowbid5458 Majority of people survive measles easily. FYI
@isshapcha Jews wear bikinis.
@sinthome_index California needs ya. Without us it would cave to liberals.
@dougsterling1 Don’t send me stupid memes, bro.
@RiaLovesPawlish I referenced MANDATORY vaccines
@GVallaris Keto!
I’m curious what my followers think about California’s push towards mandatory vaccinations for children.
My weekend in a nutshell. Nursing cuddles from my sweet daughter and rocking my first bikini in 3 years. #lost40pounds https://t.co/aGLiGCqNlP
@Woelf20 @Burghgirl69 Exactly.
@jafo404 Definitely... I would like to hear the whole issue.
@alfalfarocks It is best to be informed. Breastfeeding is always best. Sanctions against countries that want to educate people is just plain wrong.
@Burghgirl69 @Woelf20 False. They want to educate people on the importance of breastfeeding. Stfu
@GaBiggunn That article makes me even more angry. Anyone that tries to argue that for@USA is on par with breast milk is a shill for these big formula companies that generate billions a year.

@ChadwickFurr Writing about life’s trials. Featured by Oprah... your liberal god. Propped up by every democrat before they found out I’m intelligent enough to be a conservative. How did I dehumanize myself? Admit you as a leftist don’t see humanity past your own self interests.
@ChadwickFurr Just proved you don’t read. It’s actually a memoir. About utter defeat and beautiful triumph. Triumph over rape, abandonment and addiction ... loss of my parents. But nice try at dehumanizing me.

@ShipitRideout @benshapiro @pattonoswalt Why does it bother you that I pointed out the being an observant Orthodox Jew, and being alt right is not compatible?

@ShipitRideout @benshapiro I have a problem with it because he isn’t alt right. When you conflate conservatism with racists, it just destroys your argument.
@ShipitRideout @benshapiro Alt right is notoriously Christian, and hate Jews more than any other faction.

@nic_fisher To be honest, I know nothing about women who use backpage for work. Porn is a different world than that.

@sarcasmlives I agree wholeheartedly.
@Callingitasicit @FashyGoodGirl_2 This girl has been scorned by my porn. I actually feel bad for her.
@FashyGoodGirl_2 @twiggurightu So because you have one friend that had a marriage end, the whole world should be rid of erotica. Mmmmmkay. I still think you’re an insecure woman that struggles with sexuality. I’m bored now. Bye.
You misspelled Satan. https://t.co/xsJpobvSLD

@FashyGoodGirl_2 @twiggurightu My time is dedicated to my daughter. Just so you understand, your hateful ridiculous attacks don’t change anything. They just make you look bitter and ugly.
@Evergreenestats My time is expensive, bro.
@Evergreenestats Yes.
@FashyGoodGirl_2 @twiggurightu I respect that... I DONT respect personal attacks on my looks. I have moved on from that world and have a wonderful family. People change.

@Apathyoverdose1 @StormWatchGirls @IE_PPact @Bigdaddycliv @Quad9x @ScottyshSin I think if women forced themselves to see the reality of abortion, no one would choose it.
@StefMacWilliams Agreed.
Not many tweets trigger people as much as my #prolife posts. It’s shocking people (mostly men) go out of their way to discredit my value of the unborn.
@UVIL1991 @jamescurro It’s almost shocking.
@Bigdaddycliv @Quad9x @ScottyshSin Thats where we differ.
@jamescurro Dude you need help.
@Bigdaddycliv @Quad9x @ScottyshSin It should be.
@jamescurro @DasTechnoviking @zigzagtshirt @Dragonhoard08 You’re serious???? Stop wasting our time.
@millenni_ills Right?
@jamescurro @DasTechnoviking @zigzagtshirt @Dragonhoard08 A sperm does not have the dna capable of turning into a human being without fertilizing an egg. Therefore a human life begins at conception and should be protected.
@Chipferris @jamescurro @zigzagtshirt @Dragonhoard08 I didn’t know there were different definitions of conception.
This is complete jibberish. https://t.co/scEUfrWqn2
@Chipferris @jamescurro @zigzagtshirt @Dragonhoard08 Like I said, life begins at CONCEPTION.
@jamescurro @zigzagtshirt @Dragonhoard08 Life begins at conception.
I have to make an example of this illiterate moron. If you think that a sperm is the same as actual conception. Please retake sex-ed. https://t.co/RhYvQZehKO
@Dragonhoard08 Bro.... trod on. No one cares about your views on abortion... or anything for that matter.

@Millz23516 I asked you to change my mind... not regurgitate leftist garbage.
@SrEconomist Didn’t change my mind.
@Deus_vult78  https://t.co/YUk6Q0y2TW
@Deus_vult78 No, we just don’t recognize him as the messiah.
Islam hates Jews... change my mind. https://t.co/Sk71WQhIHN
Bloop. https://t.co/WztW8IEjVg
@EchauriSteven I’m kosher...
@wickedtimes6970 @jdgrn01 I have to mute you. You just keep saying the same thing, over and over.
You just said Islam supports Jews. Bwahahahahahaaaaa. https://t.co/k5z3NErMgk
@wickedtimes6970 @jdgrn01 I think incessant name calling makes YOU look like the unintelligent one.
@Delkramo14 @Imamofpeace At least he calls Islam what it is. A death cult.

@florabelle444 @jmb909 Because Emma admitted to it. You need to do some research. I’m done with this ridiculous boring convo. Bye.
@will032686 @TrojanRobDog @benshapiro I think your beard is fantastically full.
@florabelle444 @jmb909 I’m sure there were a few.
@florabelle444 @jmb909 You actually think I bully people?
@BoobmanDD Weak sauce.
@florabelle444 @jmb909 Why do you take issue with me saying children should not bully others? Because I debate people that send me hate on twitter? Get a grip. You’re another annoying Canadian. Handle your own issues before worrying about America.

@BarbiTs702 Where’s the video?
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ Definitely. ✌️
@GehennaHelena @on_shadows @wuhokay Yes.... I know, I love that.
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ Yes and I have these discussions with him. Lol. It’s possible to disagree on religion and be friends.
@garrettmirsky Lol
@GehennaHelena @on_shadows @wuhokay This is irrelevant to our discussion. You are flossing over the fact that since Islam began, it’s been a war mongering, violent plague on humanity.
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ You follow the Quran and Mohammed. That tells me all I need to know.
@GehennaHelena @on_shadows @wuhokay You can try your hardest to deflect with comparisons. Judaism does not compare to Islam. Jews do not martyr themselves in the name of their g-d. I have read the Quran and the Hadith. I know my shit, sweetheart.
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ Oh and I wasn’t saying I like all Muslims because I have Muslim friends... it’s quite the contrary. I was simply stating I have talked to them about Islam and the were honest, and you are not!
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ Why do you think you can ask me who my friend is, as if all Muslims know each other. Your long winded denial of the atrocities committed by Muslims in the name of Allah... is tiresome.
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ This is untrue. I have Muslim friends. They are honest and you absolutely are sugar coating Islam. Do you think we do not see Islam for what it is? All you have to do is look at the world news. My family lives in Israel, they deal with Muslim hate and violence daily.
@bluesteel711 @garrettmirsky Factual.
@GehennaHelena @on_shadows @wuhokay Question. What’s your stance on, honor killing, female genital mutilation, child marriage, Islamic incest (marrying first cousins), death for apostates and death penalties for homosexuals?
@GehennaHelena @Superb0y_ Your level of taqiyah is astounding.
@KincKong80 You may want to reference the Ben Shapiro video where he was posed this question.
@garrettmirsky That’s a redundant statement.
@CalypsoBeach It’s intrusive and a set up question by someone who admittedly thinks religion is a farce.
@kerril35 @Pappiness Pro decency. Bwahahahaha. Stfu

@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro So you agree with abortion up until What gestation?
@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro So you think a 9 1/2 mth old unborn baby should be able to be aborted?
@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro Every gas station has condoms, bruh. Rape is .01% of abortions.
@ZazzyJets @JohnRoten2 @chrisbarr24 @benshapiro My year old baby daughter couldn’t survive without my care.
@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro It’s literally an unborn baby.
@NowellKern Not a she.
@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro Women that do not want to become pregnant use birth control. Why is this so hard for you? I’m guessing your wife or girlfriend have had abortions and you have a deep guilt that you murdered your young?
@overbeingnice Yes.
@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro You stoop to calling a baby a parasite in order to serve your conscience.
@ZazzyJets @chrisbarr24 @JohnRoten2 @benshapiro Seriously? You think killing an unborn baby constitutes humanity? For fucks sake🤦🏼‍♀️
@BarbiTs702 You can delete tweets all you want. I have screen shots 👍🏻
@JPelusio 🤷🏼‍♀️
@BadAlexCheves @Djencis @BrewingAle @StormyDaniels I defend myself against some of the most evil, hateful people that claim victimhood. I get death threats from followers of Islam daily, because I’m Jewish. I get even worse from some of the trans community. Don’t expect me not to defend myself.

@BakersDozen11 @TooFab Women are shamed consistently for nursing in public. The more images like this are seen, the more people become accustomed to it.
@unrealbiker @growingupsucks Hahahahaa
@citizenjz @LiamPatrickCam2 @politstrip @TooFab Exactly.
@Benjami64882198 @MommyBreastfeed Women don’t do it for attention. U realize the hard work it takes to exclusively breastfeed a child?
@Stockdoc118 @TooFab Hardy har har... you’re so funny.
@LiamPatrickCam2 @politstrip @TooFab Because images like the one I posted still trigger hate and uncomfortability. All while breasts are used to sell everything from perfume to men’s work boots and people don’t bat an eye.
@growingupsucks @bevroley703 If you see that image as sexual... you have a problem sweetheart.
@MommyBreastfeed Thank you 😊

My google search&gt; Hillary’s google search https://t.co/41VNiZIS8b
@lover_leon Yes very soon.
@dillonslayss @Shawnpminor1971 Gun control would not have changed the outcome on any school shooting. If someone wants a gun, they will get it.
Once again. Teaching children empathy and kindness is not boring bullshit. Maybe we should fight harder to push for core family values. Refocus brother. Refocus. https://t.co/MHUKkMfQT6
@dillonslayss @Shawnpminor1971 And I could make a bomb from household products.
@hautesangel Maybe you should research the fact that many schools required children to participate in the walkout or they would receive an F.
@WarrenShaver Typical leftist. When will you realize trying to silence difference of opinion is wrong?
@lover_leon Yes.
@hautesangel Fact check: false.
@dillonslayss @Shawnpminor1971 *manchester bombing
@hautesangel I never suggested it would “end” gun violence. I suggested it would make more sense than instructing our children to walk out of school.
Because suggesting teaching our children empathy is, well, dumb. https://t.co/DrhZgtFvfO
@hautesangel No, it’s called opinion.
Kudos to you @KyleKashuv for making a difference. We need more like you! https://t.co/2LsJ08J8dU
@dillonslayss We don’t need gun control. Period. If you want to live in a country where the government mandates you being able to defend yourself, move to Great Britain.
@AsianDadMaga It’s very possible to work AND raise goodnhumans.
@RCQ92130 Sad but true.
@AsianDadMaga Bad excuse.
@dillonslayss Because we don’t need gun control.
@hautesangel Do you have facts to back up your conclusion?
@hautesangel So yournargument is, don’t teach children to be kind to one another because it won’t help children that fee ostracized from choosing to murder their classmates?
@hautesangel And teaching our children to be kind is far fetched. You’re a moron.
Bwahahahahaaa https://t.co/eqCdbobcb7

@FO7935 Newsflash. I’m not a child. Nor are you. If me telling you to shut up upsets you, you’re free to stop replying to my posts.
@IjuakosXqwzts @Jeff_Alen Exactly. I blocked him for that.
@FO7935 You’re literally arguing with someone who thinks kids should be taught to be kind. Let that sink in, then consider shutting up.
@Trumpscokedealr Yup, because the government is never behind anything. Everything is a conspiracy, right? Gtfoh
@FO7935 Ya and walking out of school will change it too. Shut up.
@Trumpscokedealr If you think this protest is dreamt up by the kids, you’re a moron.
@ktighe08 Especially when they are right.
@jimbothehamer29 Ya because teaching children to be good people, is unrealistic.  🙄

@itswhitneymeyer @pacelattin @titoortiz @AmberNicholeM1 Why because I have different beliefs than you? Smh
@pacelattin @titoortiz @AmberNicholeM1 That is a complete lie and slanderous.

@LavenderTurkey @WriteRN Thank you
@Markowski76 You’re beating a dead horse. What he said was antisemitic. Period. Plz stop trolling me.
@Markowski76 I agree, he has every right to spew garbage. Just as I have every right to tell him he’s antisemitic.
@Markowski76 @donsteaks No you’re just and argumentative irritant.
Please be advised. This is my only account. If ANY other account contacts you and say they are me, they are catfishing you. Please for the love of G-d, don’t send anyone money!
@Markowski76 @donsteaks It’s called answering your moronic questions.
@TerranomaLead @the_dead2 You support a terrorist regime. Gtfoh
@Markowski76 You’re moving the goal posts. You can disagree, but once you start targeting and soreading lies, it’s antisemitism.
@Markowski76 The definition of antisemite is someone that is hostile to Jews. Netanyahu is a Jew. Case closed.

@nikkiskowron Difference babies are innocent and cannot protect themselves.
@nikkiskowron My mother fought to have me for ten years... then was diagnosed with cancer and died. But ok.
@Lindsey7571 @TrailofSlime @averagecadaver @WesleyArchulet1 The morning after pill is designed to stop conception.
@Lindsey7571 @TrailofSlime @averagecadaver @WesleyArchulet1 Yes.
@Eyeliner4l No.
@bobloblaw215 I’m more focused on laws allowing tearing a 5 month old baby limb from limb.
@Lindsey7571 @TrailofSlime @averagecadaver @WesleyArchulet1 I support the plan B pill, it is made to prevent conception.
@BatmanJones11 Is that the best you’ve got?
@bobloblaw215 No, my response to gun reform is politely pointing out the hypocrisy of the left. Fighting to murder babies and take my guns.
@Rixx_2 @JoanneBarnes2 Scary how one can be so flippant about an innocent unborn baby.
@Rixx_2 @JoanneBarnes2 What is the definition of fetus?

@frognamedzeus @kaitlyn_baggett Dead children matter.
@max_notmaxwell  https://t.co/UbIu5GE08Y
@kaitlyn_baggett @frognamedzeus So it’s impossible to be concerned about two things at once?
@averagecadaver I like you.
@Rixx_2 I report to G-d. Hence why I am pro-life.
@Effyraves Guilt can come from a lot of things, sis. It sure seams to have bothered you. Wonder why.
@kaitlyn_baggett Girl bye, no one cares about your beliefs.
Despicable? Maybe. Mother to an aborted baby? Definitely not. https://t.co/CvLZQfHmj9
@averagecadaver @TrailofSlime @WesleyArchulet1 😏
No observant Jew defends abortion, references another mans wife’s sex life, or questions another Jews spirituality. FYI https://t.co/MpOAtbrIJZ
@averagecadaver @TrailofSlime @WesleyArchulet1 I had a discussion with you, sis. It’s tedious having to explain the fact that I don’t agree with killing babies in the womb, for two hours.
@linda_boggess1 Exactly
@TrailofSlime @averagecadaver @WesleyArchulet1 Dead children are bad.
@kaitlyn_baggett Not an argument.
@kaitlyn_baggett  https://t.co/Ks7Q7DA6q9
@averagecadaver @TrailofSlime @WesleyArchulet1 Yes I am pro children staying alive. 🙄
Facts don’t care about your feelings. https://t.co/IJxbBTx68y
@TrailofSlime @averagecadaver @WesleyArchulet1 Because I believe life begins at conception. Abortion is taking the life of an innocent defenseless baby. That is why.
@Effyraves @DealsShady Adoption is a beautiful choice.
Your mom. https://t.co/utihsqh8s3
@BudgieBigelow @TrailofSlime No, but I can report you for targeted harassment.
@TBirdusThoracis In what way?
@Effyraves @GenButtNaked08 Those cases equate to less than 1%

@TrailofSlime @WesleyArchulet1 It starts conversation. I think both issues are murderiusly vile.
@GriffenLloyd You felt the need to interject, because I made a joke about my finances?
@TrailofSlime @WesleyArchulet1 Both are murder.
@Effyraves What does my former occupation have to do with our conversation?
@GriffenLloyd I made a joke. You’d like to debate my comic timing?
@TrailofSlime @jemmhousingllc  https://t.co/UuuiEIk8hy
@The_CO_Atheist Aaaah... the “abortion for rape and mothers well being” argument. These cases add up to less than 1%. Also, just the fact that there is no law on aborting 5 month old babies in the womb is sick.
@GriffenLloyd  https://t.co/jBN0r5YJc3

@Jockstrap93 @tanner_w79 @snowlion340 Bro, I clicked on your profile. No one wants to see your asshole. Delete your life.
@The_CO_Atheist Why can’t both be bad?
@Effyraves @emtlove16 You sound like a woman who has a lot of guilt.
@TexasArmyChris Lol
@justinerendon How do I contradict myself?
@Eric_Dorris1 Yes it is.
You are a woman, shaming another woman because she believes in the right to life. Let that sink in. https://t.co/BU33nze2Ca
@jtherrien95 It’s constant.
@freetobrieme Agreed.
@freetobrieme Irony aside. Silly memes aside, I am pro life. No amount of your vitriol will change the fact that I think abortion is murder.
@decdarcy @Oliver33916 @MehSpa1991 So you hope your daughter gets abortions. But if she is against abortions, she will be a dumb cunt? Ok.
@fleekirony I don’t know her.
@inminivanhell Your attempts to hurt me, don’t. I have turned my life around and continue to do so. God bless.
@freetobrieme Abortion costs a life.
@joshalyne22 I agree.
I am at home. With my child, that I didn’t abort. https://t.co/HjshoiZk2m
@freetobrieme A condom costs mere cents.
@SmokeFreeUA @jtherrien95 @Heathmeisterr You seem focused on attacking a woman you don’t know for her opinion.
@MehSpa1991 @whoflungdo Mansplaining
@inminivanhell Adoption.
@freetobrieme Killing your baby because you can’t be bothered to strap on a condom is IGNORANCE.
@MehSpa1991 @whoflungdo Prove it.
@MehSpa1991 @whoflungdo You are a group of cells.
@wicked_smmarrt @bevroley703 I am concerned about human life. You are wasting my time.
@swampfox46 @trilX0gy Everything about this statement is true.
@synflyn28 @eddiemr2ocean @GOP Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
@freetobrieme Semantics.
@MehSpa1991 @whoflungdo It’s murdering their OWN child.
@wicked_smmarrt @bevroley703 Mere life? Nothing about life is mere.
@SmokeFreeUA @MelissaRose0324 So your argument is I shouldn’t have an opinion because I am sober?
@labyrinthcat_ Birth control.
@wicked_smmarrt @bevroley703 Life begins at conception.
@stephiepnyc Do you?
@130moodttrbl Wrong
@trilX0gy Same sad talking point. Kill babies in the womb so you aren’t inconvenienced.
@inminivanhell As hominem. This does not win a debate.
@EposVox Your argument is to kill babies in the womb, so no one has to deal with them?
@130moodttrbl There were 3700 babies killed yesterday.
@ThatBoyBobs Ad hominem.
@snowlion340 @Jockstrap93 Or because they divert from the topic.
@ArpanaR1 So murder them in the womb, just in case they might be in a school shooting in the future.
@freetobrieme So your argument is it’s better to murder them?
@ThatBoyBobs Yet, here you are... talking about me.
@Effyraves Explain how it’s invalid.
@CarnationRev @janeygirl11 Fact- pornstars aren’t frivolous with sex. If that’s what you’re implying.
@synflyn28 Obamacare
@Leeland1992 Triggered
@130moodttrbl Keep telling yourself that.
@Im_aSuperhero No
@alexvee10 Murdering kids....
@Jockstrap93 This is an often repeated leftist talking point. Completely false.
@wicked_smmarrt @bevroley703 You are a moron. No fetus is single celled. A embryo has brain activity at 5 weeks. If you’re going to argue your point, do research.
@AnthonyDCaserta The same thing I explain to my step children who live in Israel.
@janeygirl11 No, I think they are frivolous with sex because they know abortion is an option.
@otero_kc22 Yes, because murdering babies is funny.
@wicked_smmarrt You’re comparing a human baby to plankton.
@RenataBlissFDT Illegalized bro? 🤦🏼‍♀️
@igordelija Ad hominem.
@wicked_smmarrt A life is a life.
@MehSpa1991 Well I just compared them so 👍🏻

@Bubbataaa @MrClarkJKent @Primal2112 Wrong. My husband is from Israel, and I converted orthodox. My child is considered Jewish and is recognized by the israeli Bet din
Why did the painter say he was inspired by “kill whitey”? Trust me, sweetie, I am well versed in art. I have pieces hanging in my home worth more than your existence. https://t.co/svjfH8Ae6n
@MikePyne2 It’s irrelevant because it was prior to his presidency.

@gabbymarisa Is that good enough for you? Is that plain enough English for you?
@gabbymarisa The fact that this artist is known for painting racist paintings and also describes his inspiration as “kill whitey” is terrible, but hey it’s art. I get that. Then to have our former president choose this racist scum to paint him is troubling and an obvious attempt to anger.

@4_tunes_kookie @erreebus You’re being obtuse.
@erreebus @4_tunes_kookie Exactly
@JerryCordy @MichaelVitaleJr I know that six fingers is an occult symbol.
@4_tunes_kookie @erreebus If you think there is nothing racist about concurrent painting of blacks beheading whites... then I would say you’re gullible.
@AltBar4 I didn’t say he shouldn’t be able to paint it, I think it’s terrifying our former president chose this artist, who is obviously filled with hate towards whites.
@4_tunes_kookie How can you not see the symbolism?
If you think this is Obama’s being tone deaf, I think you are underestimating the depths of his hate. https://t.co/t2NYlz0kHf

Where were the actual victims, definitely not invited to the #goldenglobes . Hollywood had the chance to actually give these women voices and failed. Why not put Rose McGowan, Mira Sorvino or better yet an unknown up and coming actress that was raped by Weinstein, on stage?

Well even though it was deleted I know it was from @thejessicadrake and @sinnsage these two were instrumental in setting the wheels in motion of August’s demise. https://t.co/NYDFRpT1zm
The scariest part of the attacks on @AugustAmesxxx is that they were led by quite a few big females in the adult industry. These women fanned the flames of the trolling against August. Everyone should read the thread. So disappointing and tragic.
Are you trying to start another witchhunt against me? Have you learned nothing from what happened to @AugustAmesxxx ? You disgust me. https://t.co/W9amCRcRU9
The issue is the vitriol with which the “community” that governs these issues come after people they don’t agree with. How hard is that to understand? https://t.co/Yqu5jmATlC
Maybe police your community and educate the attackers on how to not make people die https://t.co/AMY9zifZjg
I would like to point out the incredible amount of attacks that were made on me by the lgbt community when I voiced my opinion on a trans woman being in Playboy. I received death threats against me and my daughter. This went on for days. This mob mentality must end. #augustames

@twitter @jack this man called for the suicide of @AugustAmesxxx and he got his wish... she committed suiced today. Do what is right and delete him from twitter. https://t.co/vKUgiG8dmq
You told my friend August to swallow ancyanide pill... you are directly responsible for her death. I will not rest until you are deleted from social media all together. https://t.co/e4VBdIwrgB
Agree 100% https://t.co/RtVFyIdXhP
SHAME ON YOU... you need to re-evaluate your life. Your community is becoming a lynch mob, when anyone says anything you dislike. I have been on the other end of it and received death threats from it. STOP THIS SHIT NOW! https://t.co/QlmQajKQv0
I’ve been saying this for a long time... I deal with such intense hatred, and I’m able to turn it off. Maybe I’ve just grown accustomed to the harassment. But young girls in porn aren’t, and bottom line, none of us deserve it. https://t.co/Hcsh7st5zq
