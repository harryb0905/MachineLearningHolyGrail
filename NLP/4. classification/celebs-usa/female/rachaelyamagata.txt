Just returned from Tbilisi Open Air Festival in Georgia where people experienced love and music and welcomed us with such warmth and kindness.  I hope the spirit of this potential I’ve been lucky enough to to witness as a traveler can somehow continue to exist. https://t.co/EZnSM2YFGw
We are all connected. The pain we inflict on others we do to ourselves. Separating families and caging children will never be rationalized, strategized or justified. Bring back humanity. Human Kind depends on LOVE and COMPASSION.

Madness. May we somehow come together and remember the connection we have as human beings on this planet.  What could we accomplish if all our hearts were filled with love and felt safe? If kindness and compassion led every move...
It’s never too late to have a great day.
