@linzsports That’s what I thought at first, but then I was told that if Phoenix beats Seattle and because Seattle was the #1 seed overall, Phoenix gets the home court advantage!!

Daaaaaannnngggg, @boogiecousins to the Warriors!!! This is crazy....like they need more help!!! 😑
@BradT2323 @isislaz Nooooo, I meant the format meaning the teams w the best record despite conference....obviously not the number of games!!
@isislaz Meaning the top teams will make the playoffs, based on record....not based on conference!!  Obviously the game format wouldn’t be the same
That was saucy!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/KsN05D6Sen
LAbron messed up my plans for the night. Was planning on finishing up season 2 of “Queen of South”....and I can’t turn ESPN off!! 🤦🏽‍♀️

If we played the drink game when you speak Lebron’s name...everybody would be drunk!! Every single tweet is about him....let him live bruh!!! https://t.co/wjOcLnUEEd
WOW!!! I hate to talk about the refs...I know they are human. They make mistakes!!! But....These refs definitely had a lay over in Vegas on the way to the Bay!! This is ridiculous
Nah...Milli Vanilli!!!! 😆 https://t.co/cxIkVesjxY
Looney looks  like the cool uncle at the family reunion that bbqs for everybody!!
STEPH CURRY IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!
@DishNSwish I actually like Nance. He plays hard and does little things that don’t even show up on the stats! Clarkson on the other end....😏😒😡
@LaChinaRobinson @tomhaberstroh @JeffZillgitt SMH!!! And he never met a shot he didn’t like....takes some serious ill advised shots
Clarkson drives me bananas!!!! 🤬
The refs are back at it 👀👀
If I’m Tyronn Lue, I’m drawing the first play for @TheRealJRSmith

This @nyliberty x @IndianaFever game is definitely LIT!!! 🔥
Since you on here...was that a call or a block on Lebron!!?? I even missed you today!!! CC: @SwinCash https://t.co/NmEUpXyLLN
@ChristyWScott51 yeah, some naysayer talking about JR going to be traded into the WNBA after this mistake!! So, I had to say something...🙄
I wish it was JR that was in concussion protocol ....at least he had an excuse!! Damn, I’m hurt and I didn’t even play!! Can’t imagine how Lebron feels!! 😟
Is JR going to the podium?? I need answers
@deerestgod Actually was a perfect miss. They had the last possession. Either put it in or call a timeout...yes he could/should have made the free throw but the Warriors would  have had over 4 seconds to win it! Smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
Maybe I need a burner account because I really want to get some thing off my chest!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
THAT WAS NOT CUTE OR FUNNY!! Never seen anybody in the WNBA do such thing!!! https://t.co/aTfqGb9oki
@dreamingtree44 SOOOOOOOO ANNOYING!!!
DAMN!!! You play your heart out. Have an amazing chance to win game 1 on the road....and I hate to look at one play/player to determine the outcome of a game, but...COME ON MAN!!!! 😩
NO 💩💩!!!! https://t.co/2ODKthJ0CF
Wait....why did he get tossed!!?? Like I said before...refs are tripping!!!
OMG...did JR think that they were winning!!?? I can’t ....u always gotta know time and score!! 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️

@Forever_AVB @benw70 @RealSkipBayless I was referring to the tweet before that one...when he said Lebron is cheering for the Rockets! My bad....😬
Stop taking ill advised threes!! 🙄
@RealSkipBayless Even today you are talking about Lebron!! Leave the man alone....he is enjoying his family and a glass of wine after carrying his team to another finals! Your obsessions is sickening!!
@Jose__Guimaraes A Sport tv já me convidou várias vezes mas eu vivo nos Estados Unidos e é difícil coincidir com que esteja em Portugal...e quando estou em Portugal, costumo estar na Figueira da Foz....mas qualquer dia apareço! 😁
Capela could play on my team any day!! Love his game! Love his hustle

At least Rodney Hood went in without complaining...I’m assuming
@MsPeters14 They are getting on my last nerves!! All they do is shoot jumpers and there’s NO hustle whatsoever!! 🤨
PSA: your sense of urgency can’t be greater in the 1st quarter than the 4th!!! Just saying....
Every player, every team has fallen in love with the 3 point shot!!! 😑
Lebron just stole the @AllDecade14 shot...one leg floater in the paint!! That was her signature move!! #Money
Taunting much!!???? 😱😱😱
Dear @DIRECTV , Every time it rains in Miami - which is almost everyday - I can’t watch tv!! I have an important game to watch, so I’m gonna need you to get it together ASAP!! It happens way too often, especially if we take into consideration my monthly bill!! 🤬 https://t.co/0RvTXtbIRF

@kellzB2332 Ugh!!! I hate typos and I really hate the fact that you can’t go back and edit your tweets!! Thank you for pointing that out!! 🤦🏽‍♀️ I fixed it
If I could give one advice to the Philly players: HUMBLE yourself!! Swag/confidence is one thing, but cockiness is another!! Learn from it grow and come back wiser!!!
@SwinCash That was a great game!! Experience and coaching was obviously a factor!! Philly should be good for some years to come! They just need to grow (individually and as a team)
This game is everything ....I’m hoping for a game 6 and 7!!!! 😁 #SaricIsTheRealProcess

@CoachYoOleMiss Congrats on the new job!!! Super happy for you!! Well deserved!
If you love sports but you've limited yourself to watching men’s games, you're missing out on a lot. We need more and better coverage of women playing sports. https://t.co/w3B383WmqY # via @HuffPost
The face you make when you get on a flight and the person directly next to you stinks!! #Help 😷 https://t.co/QHsTK1Krea

As well as...Parity, competitiveness, excitement, buzzer beaters and a lot of jaw dropping plays (with zero plays above the rim)!!! https://t.co/BwHn5po7fV

Good luck to Villanova and Michigan when they try to top this game tomorrow!! It’s NOT gonnna happen...women’s basketball is, indeed, the 💩 (excuse the emoji)!!! 😜

@auntieto2 ESPN2
These scores!!!!!!! 😱😱😱
@Dougjnew12009 They are not open channels...I guess only if you have a certain package...and I honestly refuse to add any channels! It’s not about the money. Just being stubborn...we always have to fight for everting!! Sad, but reality
Well....this comes right on time!!! 😕 https://t.co/IuP7H1ItJG
As a HUGE basketball fan, I have to be saddened by the fact that all 8 games today will be on only ONE channel!! Yeah, the app is great, but it’s not TV!! Still long ways to go for #Equality

News Flash: Women’s bracket also busted!! 🤦🏽‍♀️
Current situation: how to watch the women’s #NCAA tournament https://t.co/N5K4C3USR5
Dear ESPN (2),   We all love to watch UConn play but they are up by 40....maybe it’s time to switch to another game!!   Thanx, Ticha
55 points in the first quarter!??!! Going for 200 today...does that mean everybody get Chick-Fil-A!!?? #UConn
I’m over here watching this UConn game and I’m looking at their shoes like: “what are those!!??” I think they are the Lebron XV in white and blue!! 😍
Is that a Retriver!!?? #PunIntended https://t.co/cU2JOSqsJG
@JJ_2 NO FREAKING WAY!!!! 🤣🤣😩😩🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Ok, it’s official...my bracket is all the way busted!! 😩 I guess the only brackets still “alive” might be from the #UMBC people ...if they actually picked themselves!! 😝
@Trackstar27806 I’m glad u did tell me. I corrected it!! Appreciate the assist 😁
I’m gonna be honest...I didn’t even know what #UMBC standed for!! 😬 I know now...#RetrieversAreOkWithMe
@Trackstar27806 I knew that...typed too fast. M next to the N on the keyboard messed me up
@mntwins020733 i knew that...it was my phone...N and M right next to each other!! And I hate we can’t edit tweets!! 😑
I guess the saying: “defense wins championships” is overrated 😬
Where is the UVA’s defense!!??? 🤨
@RealSkipBayless HOW DO YOU STILL HAVE A JOB!!?? #LebronHater ...Even Stevie Wonder could see that was an incredible dunk!! Retire already!! 🤦🏽‍♀️
I know one thing - UVA better get it together or ALL of my brackets will be busted FOR REAL!!! 🤦🏽‍♀️

Good question!! I was thinking the same 🤔 it’s called #TVratings https://t.co/QyVvYeWWJH
@AdrianaHoop thank you! I just checked and it does say “Women’s Basketball”, but it’s not on 🙄
Question: besides the game showing on ESPN2, are the other women’s games only on ESPN 3? Or are there any hidden channels showing these games?? I’m asking for myself not for a friend...
It’s about that time....time to dance!! 💃🏽  #NCAAW ⛹🏻‍♀️ #NCAABbasketball🏀  #FBF 🔙 #ODU #1997… https://t.co/vBmOl1f8pC

@BarbT22 I agree 100%, but something has to change because whatever they have is not working AT ALL!! Their body language is atrocious ...
I didn’t know the nba 3 point contest was tonight ....cause that’s what this game looks like!! 🙄
@BarbT22 I mean...they have to shake things up! This is embarrassing...and I don’t think the answer is via trade, so....
@Plouffey_15 I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it...🙈
David Fizdale to the Cavs!!! #YouHeardItHereFirst
@AntonioLozada Yes! Body language is terrible...seems like they don’t wanna be there! No fight!

@SwinCash PS - You look fabulous on camera!!! 😍😍
@hoopism @SwinCash You need to watch the games and participate!! Every Tuesday, ESPN2....
@hoopism @SwinCash Trying to guess the #WhoAmIWNBA player. A little trivia that ESPN2 puts on every Tuesday night during the game.
@BradT2323 @SwinCash There's nobody on both teams that have the same bday as Klay, which is Feb. 8th!! So I'm over here like 🤷🏽‍♀️
@SwinCash The pressure is real...and I really don't know who the player is!! 😩 I'm going with Evelyn Akhator #WhoAmIWNBA
@SwinCash I can't even lie...this one got me all the way confused, plus in sleepy!! I'm going with Evelyn Ahkator!!

Why wasn't Korver in the game??? And they needed a 3? I'm confused ....TERRIBLE management/execution/decisions in the last minute!!!
KD.....the KILLA!!! 😮
I'm glad Tristan Thompson came in for defense 🙄#GoEatSomeCookies

Uncle Drew....I have been waiting for this!!!! https://t.co/8XVjVIculJ
Hello Kyrie, welcome to the 2017 NBA finals!!!
Is Kevin Love trying to be in the 3pt contest next All Star Game?? GO INSIDE.....
So Kyrie leaves Thompson to go double on Zaza....REALLY!!??? Come on man....
I have seen more travels in one half...seriously!! It's getting ridiculous! Do the refs get fined if they call it!!?? I'm confused...
Korver just took 5 steps to dunk that ball...I guess when all you do is shoot 3's, u need a head start!!!
And....WHAT IS A TECH!!???? 🙄 https://t.co/Juce5m1v6T

Thanx Ryan for the S/O...and yeah, this is my way of being competitive now! This one is harder: is it @De11eDonne?? #WhoAmIWNBA
Nobody answered me...was RiRi at the game????
Dear Khloe, next time try to bake some cup cakes instead of cookies....maybe it will have some psychological effect on KD!! 🙈
Both teams take really bad shots...but the difference is the Warriors make a lot of the bad shots they take...Cleveland, not so much!!
Kyrie found a way....get a screen by whoever Clark is guarding and then take him to school!! Cause he sure can't do that on Klay!!
Did #TwoChains upgrade his name to #TenChains???? 👀👀👀👀👀
Paging Kyrie Irving ....
OMG...it's official: this man got hacked!! Two compliments back to back!! 😲 https://t.co/R9pACbYimK

Jonathan Simmons out there looking like Lebron with that monster block!!!!! 😳😳😳😳
@emjayeknickzfan Russel Westbrook, Wiggins, Draymon Green....there's like 10 players before him (in my opinion...of course!!)

If you have a game today in the NCAA tournament, I'm gonna need u to know who your opponent is!! 🤔🤔🤔 That's all I'm gonna say ....
The thing about UConn is that their "switch" is always on. Doesn't matter the opponent, the score, time left and that equals...consistency!!
Is today #GoodFriday or #UpsetFriday!!?? 😳😳
