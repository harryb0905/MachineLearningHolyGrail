@Abadesi @joinelpha Done!
@plasticbugs @miscamy Happy to! I was looking mostly in SF though so I wouldn't have to worry about the shipping aspect.
@danauer Really??
@plasticbugs @miscamy I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre all kid appropriate?
Does anyone in SF need about 50 review copies of science fiction and fantasy books? I will donate otherwise, but happy to give them a happy home.
@joinelpha hey, never had a problem visiting Leap from my work computer, but now you've been blocked since the change! Any idea why?

@byorski haha I was the opposite! We said it "Ruck" and always got "Rook" with a long O sound.
@byorski do you pronounce it "Ruck?"
@byorski @SamSykesSwears Whoa... so my family name is "Wruck," and I've never met anyone with a name like it before. Maybe we're related!
@SamSykesSwears Imagine you have a really bad cold, and instead of blowing your boogers out and throwing them away, instead you collect them in a cup with matcha tea and drink them, and it's delicious.
The noises it's making are obscene (sorry, @Jbern44)

@KevinDavus @miradu I can't really be sure that it would be the same amount of feedback with that, but I don't have experience using harnesses. I'm really not sure why they've become such a trend, I think it's owner guilt more than dog comfort.
@pineywoozle @MykeCole That‚Äôs a weird dog.
@beefancohen @miradu Tools like gentle leaders and head collars are excellent for pullers, and they are NOT muzzles (people often get them confused). They work like horse bridles. You might need someone to show you how to use the first time.
@beefancohen @miradu No, the harness will never reinforce the right behavior. Research ‚Äúloose leash training‚Äù and practice positive reinforcement on leash. The dog is causing her own discomfort on leash and has to learn how not to.
@VanMoof please can I have my bike soon üò≠
@miradu A lot of dog owners shouldn‚Äôt be using harnesses. It doesn‚Äôt give the dog enough feedback. Only dogs who can walk without pulling should be on a harness.

@sfmta_muni Is there a reason why the estimates at the stops are so wildly off? When I got there 40 minutes ago, there was a coach ‚Äú11 minutes away.‚Äù It kept changing. This happens all the time.

@sunder_r Hey, I feel pretty crappy about my original tweet (now deleted). It was said in a moment of frustration, and I know that‚Äôs a pretty unfun way of getting product feedback.
@covercash @wirecutter https://t.co/kBuPMtXJpa
@sunder_r Also, myself and several team members tried to find a way to revert it back from dark mode, and could only do it through Terminal. If there was an option, it's so far buried as to be invisible.
@sunder_r Yes, the email window is glaring compared to the background (that's exactly what dark mode is trying to avoid). The icons are difficult to see, and the calendar suffers from the same issues. @BearNotesApp does a really good job with their dark themes for visibility.
@MusicianMikeFx Yeah, I included the terminal command in the next tweet!

@PongLizardo I do, it's called @swordandlaser (but very different subject, hehe)
@PongLizardo Hey, thank you. The show is in very capable hands!
@Snubs I‚Äôd be curious to hear from dudes who have been paid to speak on a panel. I‚Äôve spoken on many, MANY panels at many different kinds of events, but I‚Äôve never been paid (at most, a per diem and travel). Keynoting events is different tho, and usually paid.
@ClakyDruott @acedtect https://t.co/epodl6zImT
@joeDmarti Sounds good!
@MaryRobinette I‚Äôm on vacation and my friend said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited to read this book this week, have you heard of it?‚Äù and it was The Calculating Stars! üòç
@jasonrnicholson @acedtect Haha omg. I love that.
@TheOGLaurenM Goodreads is owned by Amazon.
@Lenwe33 I SAID LITERALLY
Waiter: ‚ÄúHahaha!‚Äù Husband: ‚ÄúKill me.‚Äù
Waiter, removing plate that I have literally licked clean: "How was everything tonight?"  My Brain: don't say it don't say it don't say it don't say it don't say it  Me: ‚ÄúTerrible! Hahaha!‚Äù
@MykeCole @colettecello Hey! I could probably make some connections for sure! Myke, can you make an email intro? I‚Äôll DM. Heading away on vacation tomorrow for a week but would love to chat when I‚Äôm back.
@carlos28355 Amazon! It‚Äôs for the bad air here.
@carlos28355 I appreciate that, thank you! I know, it follows me everywhere.
@TechWeCan @AdobeSpark @AdobeEdu @Adobe Hey everyone! We had an outage related to logins across Adobe today, but things should be up and running now! Sorry about that.
@QuesterMark @mozilla Same great show, just a new host! You can follow me at @swordandlaser if you're into that kind of thing too :)
@MykeCole Yes Myke

@Really_Evil_Rob @TheTrekNerd I interviewed him once and asked him a question about web comics and he called me a "silly person"
@Randydeluxe @scalzi @Blizzard_Ent https://t.co/isefkDotI5
@dylanw I feel you and I‚Äôm sorry.
@dylanw My best online friend died last year and I never knew how to talk about the feelings. We were friends for a decade and more, but my IRL friends didn‚Äôt understand. It was very hard, and there‚Äôs no playbook.
@Really_Evil_Rob Nope. I wrote a tweet about it a few weeks ago.
@jbbubba10 Then maybe that person should do it!
@nickawgomez @mozilla @pacificcontent Thank you! https://t.co/rKGUOwcg5S
@CliftonB @MicrosoftDesign but even needs, goals, and concerns of those made up people are presumptuous.
@ofallmyhopes @HBO @netflix @amazon That's very kind, but I'll leave it to the pros! I'm happy just being the idea man üòÜ
This is a really wonderful post by @MicrosoftDesign on inclusive design, and how we build too many of our own biases into personas to make them valuable (another reason I'm a big Jobs to be Done fan): https://t.co/w711NCx4gi
@NickFalacci Damn. Well, if it was Bowie‚Äôs wishes who am I to argue.
@NickFalacci I hope so!
That was it, thank you! https://t.co/ZNXqbdQoFG
You‚Äôre welcome. https://t.co/eqG10OexKb
This is tickling my brain, because I feel like there was something like this already but I can‚Äôt remember what. Do you remember? Anyway, @HBO or @netflix or @amazon get on this please.
Instead of one movie, they could make a Bowie miniseries, and have different actors (male AND female) play him at different points in his life and career.
Just came back from Bohemian Rhapsody (I really liked it) but it got me thinking about what a Bowie biopic would be like. I can‚Äôt even imagine who would play him. But then it got me thinking...

@theotherlinh YES THANK YOU
@WizardCM no, you're right.
@yuusharo it just means OF COURSE! Which doesn't make any sense (that would just be "oc" RIGHT?)

@RenttheRunway Oh cool, then I called your SF store, which according to your website is open until 7pm tonight, and the recording said ‚ÄúSorry, we are closed.‚Äù 90 minutes early?

@ProfessorAlan @swordandlaser Haha, I'm definitely not telling anyone what to do. It makes me SAD, as a creator, that some people listen so quickly that they can't enjoy the production that goes into a lot of shows (I'm not referring to S&amp;L, as we have none), but to each their own. Not for me.

Thank you, @KariByron, for the @swordandlaser mention! ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/tnvTddCUKW
@Haeze @Google I am not here to tell people how they should choose to self-identify. But if you would like to learn some of the thoughts from people who are sharing their own stories, here's a good article: https://t.co/UEwr4dLHEh
@Haeze @Google Why should it be? I mean, that is *also* a search someone could do, but not all people identify that way.
@dannysullivan @Google Thanks! As many have noted, it appears that the results are assuming people are looking for "dark fantasy" authors, based on the results being returned.
@geekgirldiva it's also kind of amazing that he basically just called Miles ugly.
@JamesSACorey @TheExpanseWR Hey. I'm a little late (was in the woods), but the season finale was FUCKING AWESOME. üëè
@partsguy74 @acedtect @hawkinson88 NO, PAY ME!*  *I don't actually know
@jennschiffer PSSHHH I just had an iced coffee and I'm EXHAUSTED.
@codertimt @cantiswpg And even if they DID, Google can (and should) as an organization be able to say "did you mean authors who are black?" or "are you looking for dark fantasy authors?" This is how the MACHINE LEARNS.
@codertimt @cantiswpg I have been working in genre fiction for ten years. People don't say "black fantasy" to mean grimdark or dark fantasy, at least not that I've ever heard. It's not analogous to black / death metal.
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google @EvaLongoria It's extremely easy for a white male to find that representation, because it's the dominant majority. We also ALL grow for reading works written from different perspectives. It's one of the ways we learn empathy. So please try to have some, because I'm exhausted of explaining.
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google @EvaLongoria If a person of color says "I love fantasy. I wonder if there are any authors LIKE ME that I can look up to, or who write from my perspective!" and the algorithm doesn't return any, that can be very disheartening.
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google @EvaLongoria Again, please try to *hear* me. It's not about "black people only reading black authors." It's about feeling like you are being REPRESENTED by others like you, which might make you more likely to participate. This is important.
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google Here's a great article by @EvaLongoria about why representation matters, as well as a choice quote. Check it out: https://t.co/y3lc15MeZ4 https://t.co/lGt3l2gFUM
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google Agreed! But that's not the point I'm making.
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google OP, who appears to be a woman of color, was searching for authors of color. Representation matters. Being able to find representative voices in heavily white / male spaces helps to encourage others to participate. Not that hard to understand.
@cantiswpg Algorithms are trained by humans. Humans are fallible. Therefore, teaching it that "black" and "dark," depending on what word they're modifying, mean very different things. Context is key!
@cantiswpg yes. that's exactly what I think is happening. but like... it kind of doesn't matter?
@wintergr3y @Google  https://t.co/0CRf6sTY7b
@Castorshells @feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google If by "astounding" you mean "astounding that we have to keep doing it because it's not getting better," then yes.
@slapshotsamurai @Google please see my follow-up response.
Adding more context because I'm getting a lot of copycat responses -- yes, I believe this is the work of a bad algorithm, not purposefully malicious.
@EricWoodard1 @Google No, I sincerely believe it's just a bad algorithm.
Do we know anyone at @Google who can look into this? I was able to replicate on my own search as well. https://t.co/Tg59LE7HUF
@feliciaday @MistressofReads @vaginalfantasy @Google Wow indeed. I don't think I know anyone on the Search team, but I will amplify!

@missmarisol I‚Äôm not sure! My friend got it for me, I will ask.
@techsalot @CAH So, let me ask you -- why are you wasting YOUR time telling me not to have an opinion?
@techsalot @CAH I play and love CAH. I've been a supporter for a long time, since before they even had a real product. And as I said in other threads, this has nothing to do with themed advertising. It's a bad call to write it AS THE (POTENTIALLY) DEAD PERSON. IMO!
@littlewhip @CAH oh god, I'm so sorry.
@trishm *hugs*
@CrankyBazard Copying this from another response, which you probably didn't see: I'm not against the idea of promos around "Days". They suck, but basically unavoidable. It's this PRESENTATION of receiving a letter from someone that does it. It's poor taste.
@alexwaddell @CAH Oh, to be clear, I'm not against the idea of promos. They suck, but basically unavoidable. It's this PRESENTATION of receiving a letter from someone that does it.
@AnnieGaus Yeah, that's where the empathy part has to come in. The typical "Mother's Day" or "Father's Day" promo is one thing, and probably unavoidable, but to write it AS the person? Different story.
@JayInHooville @CAH I'm so sorry.

@zamn I did get her name via the app, but as she didn't give consent to have it published here, I'm not putting it out there unless she comes forward.
@TheMarySue Don't even give this person attention.
@LudwigK This is the SECOND time I've heard about this person today, from two different sources. smdh.
@politechjunky She‚Äôs using this to make extra money. Even on an Apple engineer salary, $2500 out of your paycheck a month in the Bay Area is no small amount.
@realNaeemAkram She‚Äôs from India, she is sending money home.
@ratkutti I don‚Äôt think she pulls all-nighters.
My Lyft driver last night was a 24yo engineer at Apple, who drives on nights and weekends so she can send back around $2500 each month to an orphanage in India, where she pays for all their educational needs. Thanks for the ride and the hope for the future!

@_LanaLavender @edward_tah @JoshConstine I'm honestly confused about how a journalist linking to their own work on their publication (which, btw, is not behind a paywall) is somehow "tricking" people.

@linecook This makes me so angry. That people can even still be like ‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt you just being a hypocrite for turning away people that think differently than you?‚Äù No. Fuck Nazis and people who give them space to exist.
@supersetgreg anyone could and should wear clothes that make them feel good about themselves, especially if they're doing something good FOR themselves like working out.

@darth Yes! In fact, that is one of the most effective ways to teach dogs to do stairs (which are scary as h*ck)
@darth Holy crap -- what I love about this clip is that the big dog is actually PROPERLY TEACHING the puppy using positive reinforcement training. As soon as the puppy gives the desired behavior (backing off, not begging) the dog gives the pup the reward. Training 101.

@DGore_stories @GhostMummy2 I don't like scary movies personally.
@buffer Mobile app did not work.
@buffer no error message, it just resets the twitter auth page. i can try the mobile app.
@baedenfield1 nope! doesn't really feel like it warrants more than one 20-min talk üòÜ

@mbrevoort but it does close / archive them when you close the conversation, which is nice. there are a lot of messaging limitations in threads too, so I don't blame them.
@bragebang Yeah, I think that's fine! Listeners like to know what to expect, so having distinct segments within the show (maybe with their own audio cues or intros) will really help.
The new @intercom / @SlackHQ integration is SO GOOD. Just got to try it out with a real customer and it works perfectly. https://t.co/CSHzeRyokd
@bragebang I love long form (and in fact, wish we could explore that more on IRL). Is it a round-table kind of discussion? Or a monologue? Are there segments? How do you break them up? Many questions!

@dsilverman @trydisco @nearfuturevideo @beefjurgy Lack of recognition is the number one reason why people leave their jobs -- and in fact, praise is a better motivator than cash (check out @danariely's work). But we're also not a "raises" tool.

@garywhitta Yes I was telling @ryan about her yesterday!!
This is a rough estimate, it could be as high as 75% I really have no idea.
65% of my camera roll is photos of dogs that I haven‚Äôt met (yet).
@CarFan_5801 @vaginalfantasy @Nnedi Is it coming out that soon? I remember looking at the date of the third but I may have had holiday brain. I‚Äôm already on book 2 anyway, but I wanted to ease people back in. I think it‚Äôs up to you!

@JAdamMoore Writing is good. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll say the wrong thing, but there are people you can call to talk to. I‚Äôve done it myself. It‚Äôs not weakness to talk to someone.

@ReverbSoul I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs the kind of saying one person owns. I‚Äôve been saying it for ten years.
@alexwhiteart @tferriss Also (and I can‚Äôt believe I even have to say this) you‚Äôre not LITERALLY supposed to say it to someone. It‚Äôs self-empowerment. I mean, you CAN, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that. üôÑ
@alexwhiteart @tferriss Because fuck being taken advantage of. Fuck being suckered into working for free for lame promises. It‚Äôs ‚Äúunkind‚Äù to tell people not to stick up for themselves. Also, saying ‚Äúfuck‚Äù is fun.
@anildash Well, they‚Äôre dead to us now. So...
@AidanBranson Raccoons?

@JustCallMeTurbo @NathanaelB That's not really the kind of bots being address here, and also those are made to incite people.
@TexasDevin @NathanaelB Haha.... I think that's just icing on the niceness cake!
@NathanaelB I agree with this 100%. I see what people say to bots, and it's distressing.
@stephenmalovski We've already got most of our episodes planned out for season 2 (and have already finished three) but I've already brought up your idea to our producers!

@jaredremy @spokesoftware that's really not my job.

I've been getting invites to this event for weeks, and I finally wrote them back to say I'd like to see more (any??) women on the panel. No response from @spokesoftware. Can we at least try? https://t.co/la5WPuNkZP
@fractality @scottjohnson anyway, I agree now with @scottjohnson that you're just pushing buttons for the sake of it, and I've said my fill. Have a good one.
@fractality @scottjohnson also, I think it's really bizarre that you believe people can just "go out and get another job" whenever they feel like it, or that they should be forced to LEAVE a job they like because someone harasses them. Why should they be punished or made to change?
@fractality @scottjohnson sometimes people are afraid for their own jobs. again, it's about power.
@_ionzi_ @mozilla thank you!!
@BenKuchera Where do you feel the pain? Sinuses? Try a Sudafed and three ibuprofen.
@fractality @scottjohnson And if she says no, and then he uses his position of power to, for example, deny her vacation time or somehow otherwise "punish" her for her response? It's about power dynamics. And that's not ok.
@fractality @scottjohnson uh.... i'm pretty sure Hollywood woman aren't the only ones who are going through this kind of stuff.

@DeVinSimmons I definitely recommend watching the first one! You‚Äôll get way more out of the second.
OK one more #BladeRunner2049 point: half the movie is basically Fallout: New Vegas The Movie. Exactly how I pictured it. Perfect.

@ryan @stewart My response to the survey would be "Learned about it recently, still think it's ridiculous."
@Adam_EL_idrissi @mozilla thank YOU for listening!
@Martiabernathey Yeah I wonder if they shared cookies between browsers (Chrome on both devices?) or if FB is the culprit.
@gomery I guess I'm just bummed that someone would take something so positive and bring it down.
@gomery Sure, but that could be the same of some kid with a CS degree and no work experience. Just don't conflate the two issues.
@gomery It's about how you don't need a CS degree to have an impact on this industry. You don't need a pedigree.
@gomery Either you don't get the idea behind the hashtag or you're saying the people in it aren't qualified to do their jobs?
@Bhess Yup. If you check out the hashtag, many don't!
@Bhess I think you're missing the point of the tweet. It's that tech has many diverse backgrounds.

@JaredLodwick @mozilla What concerns me is when people become defensive instead of listening to what women and POCs are *saying*. So, thanks for listening!
@JaredLodwick @mozilla That's awesome, but that is not the standard. I hope it continues to change! But we have a very long way to go.
@JaredLodwick @mozilla I can't speak for Mozilla. I host their podcast, but I do not work there. Do I believe they're a company concerned about diversity? Yes.
@JaredLodwick @mozilla and I certainly disagree that it's bigoted to suggest that most technology we use is created by white men. That's just a fact.
@JaredLodwick @mozilla I agree with her. I think it's good business to have diverse minds and voices creating technology. No amount of research can replace that.
@JaredLodwick @mozilla I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt have the episode memorized. Can you give me the gist?
@JaredLodwick @mozilla Hi, I'm not actually sure what specifically you're referring to right now.
@PC_Gamer This isn't the right image.
@alphacheez @sarahlane Yes @Bodegathedog's ego searches have been blowing up today for reals. ;)

@petersonnguyen that's awesome. we actually feature a Syrian refugee in next week's episode of #IRLPodcast, he has an amazing story. Good on you.

@ElleLatham @mozilla I'm hearing a lot of anger, which is understandable in this fraught environment we live in, but not a lot of detail about why you're upset.
@ElleLatham @mozilla I'm still curious what you see as misinformation here. Also, I'm impressed you were able to listen to a 25 min podcast in 6 min.
@ElleLatham @mozilla @Twitter Did you listen to the podcast?
@ElleLatham @mozilla Twitter is not a public space. Twitter is a platform. A platform can decide what violates its code of conduct, and what doesn't.
@ElleLatham @mozilla I don't believe that protecting marginalized communities in online spaces affects the intentions of the First Amendment.

@Sofubi @ryan I don't know, guy.
@arctic_gnome @scalzi @RAINN01 I'm sure it goes heavily unreported, as do the military numbers (which they did reference). Plz show a study?
@notdetails @ryan There's no accounting for taste.
In a conversation last night, @ryan and I wondered if perhaps the Emoji Movie might be good, in a LEGO Movie kind of way.   GUESS NOT. https://t.co/a9eCclnH97
@arctic_gnome @scalzi That is categorically not true. Here are some statistics for your from @RAINN01: https://t.co/1WNABcphXo https://t.co/RXz9D6sTcl
@arctic_gnome @scalzi I would absolutely love to see your stats on that, please.
@arctic_gnome @scalzi All murder is horrible. OF COURSE. But women have far fewer opportunities to escape situations in which men are the aggressors. Full stop.
@arctic_gnome @scalzi How about sexual assault? Do you think more men are murdered by women in cases of sexual violence? Honestly. Do you?
@arctic_gnome @scalzi OF COURSE it matters. But let's look domestic abuse, for example. Do you think the death count between men and women are equal?
@arctic_gnome @scalzi @MargaretAtwood If you honestly can't tell the difference between domestic or sexual violence vs. dudes killing each other, then we have some problems here.

@Sanadil That's funny you say that, I was just looking for it on my Echo today! It wasn't there - I'll look into it!
@JayKay245 @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla It's a 25 minute podcast and I hope you'll listen: https://t.co/eYCnbpeCuY This is not about party lines. It's about following the money.
@JayKay245 @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla I'm with you on gov surveillance, trust me. But treating the ISPs as common carriers is not the same thing.
@JayKay245 @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla No, it actually SUPPORTS the free market and supports innovation. In many places, there's no CHOICE of who gives you internet access.
@JayKay245 @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla It's about allowing access to a utility that grants people free speech and access to basic services.
@JayKay245 @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla This is about preventing the ISPs from throttling services that can't pay their exorbitant rates should they create a two-tiered system.
@JayKay245 @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla This is actually a hugely bipartisan issue. It's not about gov surveillance; that's a whole other can of worms.

@realardgi @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla I‚Äôm not TALKING about ISP startups. I‚Äôm talking about companies that depend on a neutral net to offer their services and not be throttled!
@realardgi @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla If a small startup cannot offer its product at a competitive speed as a larger competitor, they‚Äôre at a major disadvantage.
@realardgi @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla No, how can a small company AFFORD to compete against a large company who can pay for a faster tier? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking.
@realardgi @whoeverplaycubs @HappyHazard7 @mozilla but don‚Äôt you see how that‚Äôs damaging to innovation? how can small companies possibly keep up with established ones?

@anchor But, will it still happen?? I feel like I have a work deadline now to come up with creative content.
@AI_Smithee I guess I could talk about "dogs I saw today"
@ericnakagawa Hmm... I try to channel the personal INTO them, so I don't know.
@anchor Also this feels like a super strong-arm engagement tactic and it makes me mad.
I have to use @anchor or else I'll lose my handle but when you already do four podcasts my brain has run out of shit to talk about.

@scottjohnson Ugh. Gwent.
@TrekkerCyber @Snubs Doesn't make it ok. But it's an important distinction.
@TrekkerCyber @Snubs Yes, and similarly racism against white people can "exist." The difference is who is in the position of societal power. Men. White people.
@petoveritas ok, i‚Äôll give it a shot
@petoveritas I mean, I wasn‚Äôt really looking for ‚Äúengagement,‚Äù i was just looking to send it to him
@petoveritas that‚Äôs so stupid
@petoveritas I don‚Äôt understand what you mean.

@Frauenfelder that would absolutely not work on me. I‚Äôd just ask for more card tricks.
@solidfog omg.
It‚Äôs so painful I had to put my headphones in and I‚Äôm not even involved. It‚Äôs physically uncomfortable for me to listen to.

@fitbodApp I saw a tooltip on one exercise once that explained how to add weight for it, I wish there were more of those for us noobies!
@fitbodApp I meant to say there was 0 weight added.
@fitbodApp Oh, I forgot to attach the picture! https://t.co/Z1rsoInGk9
@SFGiants @BusterPosey  https://t.co/7aBHmMkcgu
@fitbodApp another question! Shouldn't this be a body weight exercise? There's. I weight added but it won't let me complete.

Thought I heard @ryan's voice at my office, and immediately did the dog head tilt "I'm listening very carefully" thing. I was right! https://t.co/QwWOZBK05w
@fitbodApp now I have to workout AND do math?? üò• (lol)
@fitbodApp yeah, but say I added no weight and left it at ‚Äúzero‚Äù. In my workout rundown, it will say I lifted 0 pounds lifted for that workout.
@fitbodApp I‚Äôm still unclear. So If I‚Äôm adding 10bs to the barbell, I write in ‚Äú10?‚Äù Or ‚Äú55‚Äù?

@beandoggerel @FlemmingDave very good tweet.
@coldantlerfarm LOOK HOW PROUD!
@matthh that's amazing, congrats!!
@shyp Thanks for helping out, I really appreciate it! (My mom will too!)
