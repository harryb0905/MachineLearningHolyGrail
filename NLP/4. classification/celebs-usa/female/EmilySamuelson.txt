@kwanette Thanks!  :)
@SkateDanceDream Thank you!!!
@ohh_n Thank you!
@FollowHeidi Thank you, Heidi!  It was wonderful to see you again
@AllGrainBrewer @QuiltnBrew NO WAY!  This is quite exciting.  :)
@Hungryseagull Thank you!
@karmakamikaze I am, in Ann Arbor at the Ice Cube.  :)
@tyschalter You're very welcome!  I hope they had a fantastic time - it was lovely to meet such talented young skaters!
Thank you, @karmakamikaze!  I still love to skate, and miss every minute of it.
A very fun rehearsal for @SkateDanceDream completed tonight!  Now to get a good night's sleep before tomorrow's show.  Hope to see you at 7!
@clayray3290 Hehe - It's okay.  I miss you too!!!  Hopefully I'll be back in the Boston area again soon and we can catch up more.  :)
@WmonsterWaltz It might be!  I'm not sure... I haven't seen it yet!
@HarriettEloise Haha, maybe you're right! I've actually asked a few (mostly jokingly) as well as some pairs guys to try ice dancing... =P
Thank you, @kwanette!  I miss it too.
Thank you, @crossthefingers, for posting the beautiful photo. And thanks to both you and @bill156 for the kind words! #Honored #Humbled :)
@HarriettEloise I hope so too! I'd love to compete again, but if that doesn't happen then hopefully I can at least continue to do ice shows!
@clayray3290 Haha - thanks, friend!  I miss you already.  But why didn't you tag me in this?!  =P
@HarriettEloise Thank you!  And thank you for posting this!
This amazing young woman fully knows the meaning of "turn the other cheek"... Malala Yousafzai on The Daily Show http://t.co/joHczhTAHY
So excited to be a part of @eveningwchamps this weekend in Boston, benefitting @TheJimmyFund!  #EveningWithChampions  #LoveToSkate
@bill156 @eveningwchamps I know - I can't wait!  I was so excited to be asked to join the cast this year.  =D
@bill156 @FollowHeidi  Aww - thanks you guys!  You're both so sweet.  :)
A very well-written plea by @PutinRF_Eng of the need for diplomacy over force: http://t.co/Jyz4fyTdy5 ... At least read the end!  #AllEqual

It's that time of year again... Go Blue!  Have to support my Wolverines!  #GoBlue  #HAIL
Productivity starts NOW!
Some days there is nothing better than spending time sitting and chatting - with old friends and new - over a cup of coffee.
One of my favorite TED talks...Just watched it again! To all who want to help others: listen to @sirollinstitute -&gt; http://t.co/2akOJ3P58e
I've been awake since 2 a.m. MDT travelling from A2 to CO, but I couldn't be happier to be here!  I'm surrounded by mountains once again!
Travelling is one of my greatest joys in life... to see new places, experience new cultures, meet new people.
Thanks, @katievebee!  I had such a great time there, and am glad you guys did too.  =)  I hope the rest of the camp was fun as well!
Thank YOU, @AdrianVSST!  I'm so happy to have been a part of such an amazing camp, with such fantastic skaters.  =)  #BSC13
Such a pretty picture, @alexiskasperski!  Thanks to all of you for such a fun evening and for working so hard!  =)
@Lucilu737 Haha - I should be the one grateful to skate with all of you!  You're all very talented skaters; I'm honored to have been there!
@karebairsk8 I'm glad you had such a great time!  I did too - including my fall!  =P  Was so great to skate with all of you.
@ENERGYbits Unfortunately not nearly as possible w/o a partner! I still desperately want to compete but coaching has been a fun alternative.
@bill156 Haha - I barely came back to Twitter!  For about half a millisecond.  I'm going to try to be better now though. And you're welcome!
I'm awful with responding to tweets.  Just absolutely awful.  My sincerest apologies to the lovely skaters at the @AdrianVSST camp!  #BSC13

Sometimes it just takes faith in those who are suffering to give them the strength and courage they need to persevere.  xox
@FollowHeidi Thank you! It was so wonderful to see you at SFH... you're always such an inspiration to me. Hope to see you again before long!
@kwanfan1212 Thank you!  It was a fantastic show, as always, but in my opinion this year was the best yet!
Skate for Hope is in three days!  If you'd like to make a donation, you can at http://t.co/l6W6uLkO5R ... or I hope to see you there!  xoxo
http://t.co/frQQWbKM06  Skate for Hope is in 10 days!  Buy your tickets now - it will be incredible.  Love this show!  xox
Happy Memorial Day, everyone!  A huge thank you to all the soldiers and veterans who risk their lives for the protection of ours.
@DiegoMa79202716  =)  Thank you very much!
@kwanette Thank you!  I had a great day, made special by all of you guys with your birthday wishes.
@blazingblades Thank you!  Who knows what the future may hold, but it is an option I am looking forward to.  =)
You can also buy tickets &amp; attend SFH on June 15th, in Columbus, OH: http://t.co/0ragNAyGUk It may be one of the last times I perform!  =(
Skate for Hope is coming up!  For my birthday this year, I'm asking you, please, for donations to this great cause: http://t.co/eQVy61bytB
My close friend, Nazifa Islam, is having her first book of poetry published!  Coming out in August.  Check it out!  http://t.co/dQ1yNdssaG
Even though I'm not a finalist, still check out these 10 amazing students trying for Intel for Change: http://t.co/fLV8c0jwjS  #GreatCause
It was so great to see you @GingerJeanE!  We definitely missed @stunnasarah though.  Maybe a full reunion up at the lake this summer?!  =)
@Jkerrbear Thanks John!  Hope all is well.  :)
@AuthenticChange Thanks!  xox
@paskatefan Thank you!
@Evan_Bates Thanks, Evan!  #goblue
@fs_bot Thank you for the promotion!  :)
It's official! I'm a UM graduate. =)  Great speeches from @dickc &amp; fellow NHS student Anisha, and fun sitting by @lynn_logan_usa.  #MGoGrad
At the very least, check out the contest on: http://t.co/fLV8c0jwjS and follow @TakePart!   :)
Even if I'm not a finalist, you all should be aware of #IntelForChange &amp; support poverty alleviation: http://t.co/10ShY0HtrS  @IntelInvolved
Thank you, everyone, for your congratulations and good luck messages!  Hoping the future holds much happiness for all of us.
@jemx0 Thank you!  And shall do!  I actually really enjoy photography, so I'm looking forward to it.  :)
@kwanfan1212 =)  Thank you!  I appreciate it... It definitely feels satisfying, though I know it's only the first step!
@blazingblades @kwanette Thank you both!  I miss skating too, but am looking forward to the future and whatever it will bring me.  :)
Thanks, @octonion I am, actually!  But probably not until next fall at the earliest... I'll spend the summer taking the GRE and working!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm officially done with my undergraduate education! I cannot believe it - graduation in 3 days. Now on to real life!
Last final exam as an undergraduate in less than 4 hours!  Almost there!
Finished my last few classes as an undergraduate today!  One more final and then graduation...
@RyanSBradley Hahaha!  Love this.  Tell him "Hi" for me please!  =)  Enjoy Barce and London!
Hi all - My apologies in advance, but I won't be responding to anything unless it's urgent for the next 10 days. Finals have taken over...
@SwtHeatherAnne So nice to have met you tonight!  I hope to stop by the shop at some point; your cake was so delicious!  :)
@GingerJeanE @stunnasarah I'd love to go with mine as well.  Maybe all of us should take off for someplace amazing together?!  :)
Back to the grind with school again.  One final push before I graduate in May!
@bill156 @ansamuelson Haha! I know, Ash &amp; I were just talking about that... I really need to work on tweeting. =\ Thank you - I miss it too.
Hey @ansamuelson - Part of the reason you only have 4 followers is because you only have one tweet!  =P  Haha - love ya, sis!
@RachaelFlatt @skate90046 @Adaripp @Evan_Bates Such great memories! Still makes me laugh... we all happened to wear the same shade of blue!
@RachaelFlatt Congrats, Rach!  Hope school is going well.  It's midterms here @umich ... almost to spring break!
So I don't often watch Glee, but I'm currently obsessed with this rendition of "New York State of Mind": http://t.co/dHRRKThQ via @youtube
Thank you, @HarriettEloise. I cannot tell you how much that means to me. I miss it as well, though am still on the ice daily which helps! =)
Thanks, @kwanette!  I miss it too and wish I was at Nationals.
Good luck to all the skaters competing at Nationals this week! Wish I was there, but for now my best wishes sent-from-afar will have to do!
@AlRandall2 @billtrainor   Thanks Al!  It was great to meet you and Bill, and see my first UM hockey game!  Go Blue (and Go USA)!
Happy Christmas Eve, everyone, and Merry Christmas tomorrow! Wishing you &amp; yours all the best this holiday season, filled with hope and joy!
Thank you all for the get well wishes!  I'm feeling much better - though fatigue and a cough slightly linger.
After a 104 degree fever last night, I've been diagnosed with pneumonia... and I have finals for the next 10ish days...  Horrible timing.
Here we go!  HAIL!  For those who don't know, today's the day of the big OSU v UM rivalry game...  Go Blue!  You've got this!
@mrbaldie56 Thank you!
Just a few of the things I'm thankful for: health, happiness, life, love, and - of course - my amazing family &amp; friends. Happy Thanksgiving!
It's Election Day!  I hope all of you registered voters are educated on the issues and will be exercising your civic right to vote today!
@linkous911 Hey!  Yeah, made it safely to DC and safely back home to Ann Arbor.  I hope you guys enjoyed the concert!
@gymsk8 I haven't considered it yet! I've been looking at good Int'l Affairs/Int'l Development schools (most of which are in DC or out East)
@AuthenticChange Thanks!  :)  My field is International Studies, with a focus on Political Economy and Development.
Back from DC!  A great though busy weekend, with tons of driving.  And now, of course, back to the grind!  Thanks for all your suggestions!
Potential grad schools*  Yes, that's right.  I'm going to be a UM grad.  =P  Also, I'd be happy to hear suggestions of where to eat!
Heading to DC this weekend to check out Georgetown &amp; Johns Hopkins SAIS as potential grad school... any recommendations of things to do/see?
@Hungryseagull Thank you!!!  They are much appreciated.  And she's doing much better now.  :)
@Obriens13 Haha - Alex is great! The reason there are so many of us here at U of M is b/c most of the good ice dance coaches are in the area
@Obriens13 Thank you.  Yes, Skype definitely helps bridge the distance as all of us are located everywhere around the world.  :)
@Hungryseagull She is better now, stable and out of the hospital surrounded by family.  You have no idea how much I appreciate your prayers!
@OnlyGhostlight Thank you!  She is out of the hospital now and recovering.  Your prayers mean so much!
@Obriens13, Thank you!  I wish I could, but she lives down in TN. Luckily there's other family in the area, with whom she's now recovering.
@DougMattis Thanks, Doug!  She's out of the hospital and back with the family now.  Your support means so much to me!
@AuthenticChange @kwanette  Thank you so much.  She's stable now and out of the hospital.  Your prayers mean so much to me!
@bill156 Thank you!  She's doing better and is out of the hospital.  I truly appreciate your thoughts and prayers.
Please send prayers for my grandmother.. symptoms of a heart attack &amp; non-stabilizing blood pressure... I love you; you can get through this
Today marks the end of the Paralympic Games - I wish they'd televised it more. Congrats to every athlete; you are an inspiration to us all!
Autumn is in the air on the first home game this season... Excited to be in the Big House once again!  #GoBlue #HAIL
It's that time of year again... first day of class! New profs, new classmates, new information to learn... I'm excited!  :)
Awake early on a Saturday in September... this can only mean one thing:  Game Day!  GO BLUE!
I know this is a few days late, but good luck to all the Paralympians competing in #London2012 right now!  You all are an inspiration to me.
@HarriettEloise That being said, I'm not one to deny options so may give Rockne a call/text today... =P  (Though I don't think it's likely!)
@HarriettEloise Wow - I had no idea he &amp; Mary Beth split!  They looked so improved at SFH; I was looking forward to watching them this year!
@LynnMcMonigal Thank you!  I believe so as well, though I often need to remind myself of this so your words were just what I needed to hear!
@LynnMcMonigal, I sure hope so!  It's my dream &amp; goal to go back again - It's an experience unlike any other and I'd love to compete again!
The Summer Olympic Games are done - so bittersweet!  It brings back memories...  Congrats to all the athletes - you've lived the dream!  =)
@implausibleblog Thank you for sharing!  Hope you enjoyed it - there is truly nothing else like the Olympic Games!
... and the Olympic Games have begun! Best of luck to all the athletes!  Really soak in every single moment; it goes by way too fast!  =)
Sending my good luck wishes and congratulations to everyone competing at Lake Placid IDC and Skate Detroit!
@karmakamikaze   =D  Thank you!  I just may consider that, actually.  Thanks for the idea, and the compliment!
@SylviaUnseen   Thank you very much!
@AuthenticChange =)  Thank you very much; I really appreciate it
@LanternBell Thank you, me too!
@Hungryseagull Thank you; I appreciate it!
@bill156 Thank you!  Hopefully I'll be back out competing again soon, but if not then I understand my life may be taking a new direction.
@alijolly Thank you for the luck!  I thought so too; this was the best way to prevent rumors.  :)
@realdetective Thank you very much!
For those of you who want a bit more information about Todd and I splitting (yes, it actually happened)... http://t.co/5lNLtpPQ
Everyone in Columbus!  Come to Skate for Hope today at 5pm at the Nationwide Arena!  This is my favorite ice show; hope to see you there!
@kwanfan1212 Thanks!  I can't wait to see you too!  I'm already here, safe and sound.  Now off to bed before the show tomorrow!  :)
@daniel_marcin, Haha - I'd say it was luck!  =P  Thanks though, and good luck to you in your run for Congress!  =)  http://t.co/rr73Pu8z
Leaving today for #SkateForHope! Buy your tickets now for this amazing show; it's one of my favorites to skate in! Hope to see you there! =)
Today is a day to remember and appreciate those brave soldiers who have served and are currently serving our country.  Happy Memorial Day!
"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." ~Ronald E. Osborn  #quotes #quoteoftheday
Thank you, everyone, for making my birthday incredible.  Your messages on Facebook, Twitter, etc, all made me feel so loved and blessed!  =D
@nauman_anas Thank you!  I definitely had a great day and was smiling through most of it!  =D
@newlipstick Thank you!  I did have an incredible day, and all the support on Facebook and Twitter just made it better!
@543830 Thank you very much!
@geotro I do remember; I couldn't forget you guys! He is doing very well, thanks. I can't wait to hear him in the stands again this year!
@geotro Yes, they should be coming!  I still need to check with them to figure out how many of them will be, but all of them will attend!
Lace up your running shoes and head out to the @burnsparkrun!  I'll be there all morning to support everyone in this amazing charity race.
@Albatross Hahaha! Clever!  =)  Burns Park is actually named after a professor, and while a picnic sounds nice, a charity run sounds better!
Today I have the opportunity to speak to a great group of kids at Burns Park Elementary, and hopefully inspire them before Sunday's race! =)
I'm honored and excited to be the special guest at this weekend's Burn Park Run!  Can't wait to see you all there!  @burnsparkrun
Woke up to thunderstorms today! Very apropo as it's the last day of April. That, plus 80-degree days this Wed, Thurs, &amp; Fri bring me joy!
Congrats to all my fellow Wolverines who graduated from U of M today; I shall miss you all dearly! Best of luck with everything!  xoxo
Up early for some last-minute cramming!  Exam in 1.5 hours... will be done by 10 a.m.... Here we go!
It feels so good to be home after a slightly-too-long 11 hour day at the rink. #ThankGodILoveThisSport #NowTimeToStudy
Sometimes life just makes me smile. Life is good, and I am very blessed; thank you to all in my life who have made me the person I am today
Just returned home from the AAFSC banquet. I want to thank the club so much for being there for me through everything! I truly appreciate it
After a total of 7 hours spent scrubbing and reorganizing the kitchen, I'm finally ready to study again!  #SpringCleaning #Productivity
"Dance as thought no one is watching, Love beyond words, Sing as though no one can hear you" ... #TheWordsOnMyCoffeeMug #MorningInspiration
@CarolineJeanne Haha - To be entirely honest, I think this is the first time I've actually sat down to start studying 10 days in advance. =P
@newlipstick Thank you!  We're quite excited.  :)
@CarolineJeanne Haha, was that sarcasm?!  =P  And for finals, 10 days does not seem like much at all!
First final exam in exactly 10 days....... #ProbablyTimeToStartStudying
@jackattack119 Hahaha!  Sadly, I am exactly the same way!  #socialmediaproblems
Happy Easter!  Wishing everyone a joyous and blessed day!  :)
@TJLang70 No, I wasn't at opening day.  But at the rink we stretched in front of a TV to watch the last two innings!  =D
#Tigers v #RedSox opening game... I can't go wrong! Go Sox and Tigers!!!! =D  #BaseballSeasonOpeningGames
Today is day 2 of Great Lakes Skate, a Michigan-themed ice show in Lincoln Park that is really quite a production! Shows at 1pm and 7pm!  :)
Heading out for Great Lakes Skate in Lincoln Park, MI!  We're very honored to be a part of this show.  =)  Hope to see you there!
Congrats to all the ice dancers at Worlds!  You all did amazingly and I'm proud of you.  Hope to be joining you next year!  =)   #Nice12
and Sun at 2pm.  Stop by and see Todd and I on Friday and Saturday for a bit of MI fun!  Tickets are $6 at the door.  Hope to see you there!
Just got back from dress rehearsal for Great Lakes Skate, a great ice show in Lincoln Park, MI!  Shows are Fri at 7pm, Sat at 1pm and 7pm,
@jackieluke Haha - not that I know of!  But I picked up on it too... a great soundtrack!  :)
Best of luck to everyone competing at Worlds this week!  I'll be cheering for you!  #Nice12
Just got back from #TheHungerGames...Please, World, let's never let ourselves get that bad. However, I was pleased with the movie adaptation
@StevenHolcomb .... That's slightly depressing.  But Happy March 25th to you as well!
Performance #1 in just under an hour!  Melody On Ice at the Ann Arbor Ice Cube at 7pm.  :)  Come one, come all!
Be sure to come by the Ann Arbor Ice Cube to see Melody On Ice: The Wizard of Oz ice show tomorrow and Saturday. Todd &amp; I will be skating!
Just getting back from nearly an 11-hr day at the rink!  Feels good to put up my feet, even if I'm studying at the same time.  #Relaxation
Fellow Wolverines! If you haven't yet, go to http://t.co/2Vyd7slz &amp; vote for OurMichigan for Central Student Government, open til midnight!
@StevenLangton It's an amazing book, isn't it?! I couldn't put it down. You finished is just in time for the movie to come out on Friday! =)
And, of course, to you Southern Hemisphere-ians, a very happy Autumnal Equinox. =) Feel free to come visit us up north for warmer weather!
Wishing all you Northern Hemisphere-ians a happy and healthy Vernal Equinox as we head into warmer weather &amp; sunnier days! #OfficiallySpring
@kwanette  Haha, I'll have to!  Thanks!
@jackattack119 @nafoopal Yes, I absolutely could have!  =P
@TJLang70 Hey!  I've been pretty good, thanks.  How have you been?  How's training?  :)
I decided to study outside this weekend to enjoy the beautiful weather, which resulted in 5 bug bites around my ankles. #SkatingWillNotBeFun
Happy St. Patrick's Day, everyone.   An important day to think green, eat green, and wear green.  :)
My bedroom door is creepily and creakily opening and closing itself... #MyAptIsHaunted  #ItsProbablyJustTheWind
Nothing will distract you like a tornado-touchdown, a few riddles, and great friends. Thank you, everyone, for your condolences.  #Gratitude
@bill156 I'll make sure she's okay.  :)
@jackieluke No, I was out, but managed to find a basement.  I'm glad people managed to stay safe!
A tornado touched down not even 10 miles from where I am!  Luckily it has passed and we are all safe. #CrazyMIWeather
#RIP Mimi. You were an amazing grandmother and I only hope to live up to being your granddaughter. I will miss you dearly &amp; love you always.
@nafoopal  Ahhhh!  I wish I knew this a few minutes ago... I just returned home from campus!
Just came home from a panel at UM about integrity; it reminded me how important it is to be a good person above all else.  #Integrity
@nafoopal Congratulations!  :)  Always good news!
My thoughts are with Nathalie Pechalat in hopes of a speedy recovery!  Injuries before Worlds are not fun.  http://t.co/ibzV8lKA
@clayray3290 I know - I miss you!!!
One of my favorite #quotes right now: "If we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves" #ThomasEdison
Happy International Women's Day to all my fellow females!
Exam on globalization and the modern political economy today... +PE, KWS, UE v INF, CBI, CapMob... #StudyingTilTheLastSecond
@nafoopal Haha - finally!  =P
Very excited to skate today!  (I know, not my most exciting tweet ever but it is how I feel at this moment)
@HarriettEloise Hahaha, this is true!
@bill156 Thank you for your donations and your support! You have no idea how much it means to us. And we hope to see you there as well!  =)
@HarriettEloise Hahaha!  The funny thing is... we were joking about this just the other day on the ice when discussing music!  =P
Wow - over 3000 followers!  Thanks, everyone!  ... Perhaps I should start tweeting more now.  =)
Good luck @StevenLangton, @StevenHolcomb, and all the other bobsled & skeleton athletes at the World Championships!!!  #TeamUSA
I'll be showing up tomorrow at about noon to help you out a bit and give some tips!  =)  #UMSkateBreak http://t.co/6WSMLKfy
Fellow Wolverines, let's skate!  Head behind Pierpont today & Sat to the ice rink being set up there for Skate Break! http://t.co/6WSMLKfy
#HappyValentine'sDay! Wishing love and joy to everyone. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."  &lt;3
Thank you, @ToddGilles, for enlightening me to the world of Star Wars! I was actually surprisingly impressed. #NowSlightlyLessMovieDeprived
Good luck to everyone at #4CC, and congrats to my fellow skaters who have finished!
A crazy amount of homework is about to be completed this weekend.  #BeingProductive
@TheGeekgamer76 Me too!  Or at least, I'd like to!  =D
@ElouiseBates I thought so too. Though, worse comes to worst, I'll just hop over the border to Canada for a month or 2! Or Connecticut.  =P
@JTRules1 Really?!  In that case, I'm coming to Connecticut until April!  Haha!
@newlipstick Thank you!  We're hoping to go for something original again as well.  It's an exciting time, the off-season...  =)
@Obriens13 Definitely virtual!  And I'd say skating cheerleaders can be of any age... my Gramps is one of the loudest in the stands!  =D
@cleoc12 Thank you for the music suggestions! We always appreciate them, as choosing music is one of the toughest parts of the off-season =)
Why does Canada get an early spring?! We're not that far away from them!  =P (Though MI's winter is mild so far #NoComplaints) #GroundhogDay
Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow... 6 more weeks of winter. Yet Shubenacadie Sam (Canada's groundhog) says they'll have an early spring...
@manya_sun_18 =D  Thank you!  Haha - I love the endearment "Ginger Bears" that we seem to have been given.  :)  Hugs!
@HarriettEloise =D  Thanks!  We truly appreciate your support!
@LutzKlutz1986 Thank you!  =)
@AlexeGilles Thanks, Alexe!  Next year we'll both be there, rooting each other on!  :)  Hope all is well!
@dknowlton001 Thank you!  =)
@newlipstick Thanks! I do too. =) It was a whirlwind getting ready so fast & definitely not perfect by far! 4 months = shortest season ever!
@starrzndreamz Thank you!  Both of us were so glad to be out there again, and can't wait for next year already!
@LePigeonBercy We absolutely were!  Todd makes me laugh; I find we just enjoy even practicing together.  It's quite fun.  :)
@cleoc12 Thanks!  Me neither!  Haha!  Now is when the music-selection process beings.
@barbiebackstage Thank you! I definitely owe my toe-pointing abilities to Yasa & Yuri for all their training while I was growing up.  :)
@Obriens13 Thank you.  Hopefully you will be seeing lots more of both Todd and I!
@kwanette Thank you!  I'm hoping so.  :)
@tietinkerbell Thank you!  I can't either!  :)
Back in Ann Arbor!  #HomeSweetHome
(P.S. I really dislike only being able to post 140 characters at a time, if you couldn't tell.  =P )
for all the support and encouragement they've given us, including those directly involved in getting us ready and helping us.  #SoGrateful
8th place is a perfectly fine stepping stone for Todd and I as we start our competitive career together, and we can't thank everyone enough
After a busy day/night yesterday, I'm finally awake, well-rested, done with my schoolwork, & so grateful to have competed here at Nationals
Off to the free dance!  Here we go, @ToddGilles!!  To watch, stay tuned to NBC between 4-6 EST.  :)  #SJ2012
@kwanfan1212   Thank you!  =)
@bill156  Thank you so much... you're far too kind!  And I'm hoping for the same; a solid off-season to train is going to be wonderful!
@feelingamazing  Thanks!  It's so good to be back - I can hardly describe it!  =D
@kwanette    =)  Thank you!
@PiperGilles Thanks, Piper!
Thank you, everyone (online and in San Jose), for all the support! We met so many nice people today and are so grateful for your kindness.
It felt so great to be at Nats again! 8th place in the SD, with placements 3-9 all w/in 5 pts of each other...should be an amazing FD event!
Short Dance Day! Congrats to all my fellow skaters so far, and good luck to everyone who competes today!  #SJ2012
@MarkRJahnke No, not yet, but I'll be at the rink in about 30 minutes (hopefully!)  Are you there?
@MarkRJahnke Haha - #GoTeamSchoolOfIceDancing ... Clever!  =D
@ChuckSatterBLK Thank you!
@StevenLangton Thanks Steve!  And welcome back!  Great job in Europe.  =)
@kwanette Thank you!
Leaving today!  Practice here in Ann Arbor then onto the plane to go to San Jose for Nationals!  #SJ2012
@StevenHolcomb Welcome home!  And great job in Europe!
Happy Chinese New Year!
@tietinkerbell Thank you!  We're excited to arrive in San Jose... only 1 more day 'til we leave!
Best of luck to all my fellow Canadians competing this weekend!  @SkateCanada #CANFS12
#RIP Sarah. You were a phenomenal athlete and will be missed.   http://t.co/vAKWY8f8 via @USATODAY - Freestyle skier Sarah Burke dies at 29
Happy MLK Day! Let us remember what this incredible man did & represented as we live our own lives, striving for the same love towards all.
@whitegirlrhythm Aww, I'm sorry to hear that!  I hope you come back to visit occasionally though!
I started class at #UniversityofMichigan again! I'm very excited; I've missed school. Only two, though, so as to not distract from skating!
#GoBlue!  Wishing the Wolverines the best of luck in the Sugar Bowl today!  #HAIL!
@whitegirlrhythm: Haha - thanks!  Are you from Ann Arbor as well?  :)
@bill156 Thank you!  We're very excited, and can't wait to compete!
Happy New Year!  Wishing everyone a healthy, happy, love-filled 2012!
Merry Christmas, everyone!  May your days be filled with love and happiness!  =)
Merry Christmas Eve Day!
Why, on my one day to actually sleep in as late as I want, am I awake at 4am?  Sometimes I'm an anomaly to myself.
@TheEllenShow You should stop by the Ann Arbor Ice Cube to watch (& try yourself) some ice dancing! Home of Olympic & National competitors!
#GoBlue!  Rooting for the Wolverines in this big game today!
And I'm grateful to be alive, to enjoy this wonderful life each and every day.
I'm thankful for the experiences I've had, which have taught me invaluable lessons.
Happy Thanksgiving! #ThingsImThankfulFor:  I'm so grateful for everyone in my life, who constantly share their joy and love with me.
And it snowed here!  Yesterday, Salt Lake City looked like a winter wonderland - it was so gorgeous!  #Christmasiscoming
We're heading back to Michigan today!  After a great week, I'm excited to be back.  =)  #homesweethome
In Salt Lake City for the first time ever!  Home of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.  Mountains, lakes, snow (a bit)... it's gorgeous here!
Good luck to my teammates, Lynn and Logan, at NHK this weekend, as well as to all the other competitors!  #TeamUSA
Finally back in the US!  It feels good to be home!
Good luck to all the dancers for the FD in #2011SkateCanada today!
First frost of the year last night... Christmas music already being played on the radio...  #Winterishereearly
With the pre-competition excitement comes the pre-competition To-Do List: laundry, bank, buy supplies, pack, polish skates, finish dress...
Best of luck to everyone at #2011SA!
So excited to be given Cup of China!  2 weeks 'til leaving... so soon!  Wishing Monko/Khaliavin a speedy recovery.
Hail!  Let's go Wolverines!!  #GoBLue
"If we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves."  #quote  ~Thomas Edison
Happy Thanksgiving, to all my Canadian friends!  =)
If you're excited for the 2011-12 skating season then check out the 2011-12 @icenetwork Season Pass to watch us live!  http://t.co/TQO1G3cr
Just spilled coffee and water on my pc, cell, and all the important papers on my desk... I've literally drenched my life with my clumsiness.
I think @ToddGilles and I broke a record for the fastest unpacking of a fully-loaded car, thanks to the torrential rain!  #teamwork
Googlemaps says approximately 20 hours and 52 minutes... that's a long time to be in a car.  Here we go!
Officially woke up this morning by burning my hand reheating a cup of tea in the microwave.  #gottalovemornings
#GoBlue!  Good luck to the Wolverines against EMU today
It feels like we jumped from summer to winter.  What happened to autumn?!
I love thunderstorms!!!  Bring on the rain, thunder, and lightning!
Always remembering, never forgetting.  #UnitedWeStand, worldwide, against all terrorism.  #GodBlessAmerica on this 9/11 day
It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!!!  Congrats, boys!  Well done!  #GoBlue
Go Blue!!!  First ever night game at Michigan Stadium and I'm missing it, but my spirit is rooting them on!
Good luck to all the USA bobsled athletes in today's push championships!!  #teamusa
It's nearly 6:30 am and @ToddGilles, Mary Alice, and I have decided to start our Tuesday with a wake-up work-out!  =)  #startingthedayright
Happy #LaborDay to each and every hard worker out there in our country.  May you enjoy your day of rest!
Spilled my coffee this morning as I attempted to leap over my purse... who ever said figure skaters are graceful?! #naturallyclumsy
@RachaelFlatt Best of luck in Cali!  You'll be amazing as you always are.  :)  Miss you and hope to see you soon!
Here's to starting over!  Though it's not a new year, it's absolutely a new day, and I'm ready to live it as such!
Here's hoping and praying that the East Coast isn't too torn apart by Irene...
Wishing everyone well after the earthquake!  Stay safe!!!  #dcquake
@ToddGilles: So glad we can finally make our partnership public!  See you at the rink in a few mins!  =)

@bill156 Thank you, I appreciate it!  :)
@bill156 I'll try not to.. I just need to get in the habit of tweeting again. :)
we wish you nothing but peace and love forever.  You were a nice person and a good friend.  God Bless.
Chip Switzer, you will be remembered fondly for the rest of time.  Your tragic and untimely death has saddened us all, and
Okay, so I know I don't tweet much, but I just need to add this one more thing in case I disappear again...
(but then again, I should know by now that life is never set, but rather will throw you curve balls when you least expect it)...c'est la vie
Sitting back here in my bedroom on a Wednesday afternoon has me restless again.  I'm ready to get going!  When will life just be set?
Decisions, decisions, decisions!  Life is getting exciting!  =)
Haha, if you add mine it will be even more intense!  =P  ..   @jacowan Jean-Luc Baker and I... The Human SkatiPad! http://t.co/d3ZtQtN
A fun weekend to be followed by a relaxing book-by-the-pool Sunday.  #lifeisgood
Woke up at 6 to swim laps at the campus pool... only to find it closed for maintenance.  Oh well, at least I'm up for the day!
95 degrees currently... 95.  How is a girl supposed to survive outside in this madness?!
Going to the #DetroitTIgers game today as a goodbye celebration for a long time friend.  We'll miss you, Gina!
Today is the second day I pressed "Snooze" 14 times before waking up... I feel it'd be easier with a coffeepot next to my bed. #sleepingin
Reading "The Hunger Games" for the first time... Aw!  Peeta just admitted he likes Katniss!
Sitting by the pool with a good book is a great way to spend a Saturday.
"Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed/ So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road" = first lyric from my radio  :)
@TJLang70 Haha, seriously!  At least there is good distraction/entertainment/motivation for us all.  =)
@skating102 The partner search is going... I'm taking my time, as this will affect the rest of my career, but am trying to stay optimistic
"What are we all looking for?  Someone we just can't ignore" ~James Blunt stuck in my head this morning.  :)
Alright, trying to tweet again?!  Tw...  Twe... Tweee...  Here goes nothing!  Tweet.
@nafoopal You're funny.  =P  Good luck on your final today!
@nafoopal You're famous!  I can't wait to own a copy of your book!  =)
My thoughts and prayers are for all those affected by the disaster in Japan.  #prayforjapan
Everyone tune-in to the Hallmark Channel on Feb 15th, 6:00 EST, for a special encore showing of Scotch Shall We Dance on Ice!
Congratulations, Egyptians, on finally gaining your freedom!  So happy for you all!!  =D
@nafoopal You're obsessed.  But I agree about B&Js!  =D
Join me in theaters across the US in celebrating the legacy of the 1961 US World Team on 2/17. http://www.rise1961.com
@nafoopal Are you at work now?  and I'm sorry you're not feeling well - can I do anything?!?
Thanks, everyone, for the support of Evan & I throughout Nationals.  It was good to be there at least, and fun/interesting to do commentary!
Ready to watch @NC2011 & cheer on all our friends!  It's different being on the opposite end of the competition scene.... until next year!
@bill156 I'll be arriving in Greensboro on Friday night!   Just in time to cheer on all my friends and say Hi to everyone!  =)
Why is it that the more you clean, the messier everything else looks?  I swear, my room wasn't THIS bad...  =\
Two of my close friends, @nafoopal and @anniecross03, just made Twitter accounts!  Yay!  =)
Back in the US after an incredible 3 week study abroad trip through #forumnexus!  I'm anxious to get back on the ice... it's been too long!
Although it's been said many times, many ways, MERRY CHRISTMAS to all of you!!!  I hope you've had a joyful and fun-filled day!
Currently enjoying a Strawberry Fage while watching the sun rise over a very snow-covered Ann Arbor...such a change of pace from finals week
Alright, Finals Week, bring it on!  I'm ready for you! (Well, technically last two weeks, but the sentiment doesn't change!)
I'm so surprised that it's December already!  Welcome to the holiday season!  =)
Coming home today from an amazing Thanksgiving break with my family!  I'm so thankful to have them in my life.  =)
And the best way to get in touch with me, @ablueberrypie, is probably through Facebook, although my responses there have been sporadic too..
@clayray3290 Ah!  Sorry Clara!  I've been very bad about responding to people!!!  =(  I feel awful!!!  How have you been?!?
Thank you so much to the person who created this video!  It brought tears to my eyes.  =)   http://t.co/YpQ1Vos via @youtube
It's way too early to be awake on a Friday morning... without an alarm clock... when training won't start until 9....
@SylviaUnseen Thank you so much for the support; it really means a lot to us
Champs Camp weekend!!!  Off to Colorado for a few days of good friends, skating, and informational seminars
Checking things off my To Do list at this hour of the morning feels great!  Hello, Saturday!  =D
Final final exam for the summer in 30 minutes!!!
Tomorrow is the last day of summer classes!  Then let summer officially begin!!!
Another weekend coming to an end... Congrats to all who competed at Lake Placid this past week! And thanks @icedancecom for the updates!
@bill156 Not shot, just occupied with many different necessities (laundry, finances, filling out paperwork, homework, etc)!
It's the weekend and therefore time to catch up with everything I didn't have time to do this past week!  Hooray
@PattieGillett Thanks for the suggestion!  I love having books recommended to me; I'll have to check it out!
Haha!  Yes, everyone, I read the second one too!  =)
If you haven't read "Maus" by Art Spiegelman, I highly recommend it! The 1st graphic novel I've read, but very enjoyable as well as profound
It was one of the sweetest random things that has happened to me
So last night when walking across campus a guy ran up to me, handed me a pink flower, said "You are gorgeous; have a great day" and left. =)
Why is it that on days when all I want to do is study in the sunshine, it rains. This is killing my study-buzz (or what I even have of one).
@bill156 Sadly, I did have one!  But when rain falls sideways, it doesn't help!
To respond to one of my earlier tweets, thunderstorms are great...except when you need to walk to class during them. Enter Soaking-Wet-Emily
Went to see Inception last night!  It was as good as everyone has raved, but is a must-see-more-than-once-to-fully-understand type of movie.
There's something calming about the rain... I love thunderstorms!
@iceyfrostbidden Summer is coming along quite well!  Tons of training, but I'm enjoying nearly every minute of it, so it's all good!  =)
@NebRodgers Oh no, that's awful!  =)  I see you're from Greensboro... will you be going to Nationals in January?!?
My iPod died this morning... 'tis a sad sad thing to realize how reliant one is on technology...
There are some mornings you wish you could just sleep forever.....
@a4ashu No sadly we don't! Haha! Actually, no one in my classes knows I went to the Olympics... I'm very incognito, trying to be "normal" ;)
I've found organization to be a critical part of keeping me happy.  Or rather, sane.  =)
And it's the weekend!  With 90 degree & humid weather all weekend long you can be sure I will be doing some of my homework by the pool!
@jacowan Media and International Affairs, U of M course COMM 488. It's mostly discussion about many interesting topics; journalism, war, etc
In class for 4 hours... but I'm loving this class!  Sidenote: going to try to be updating Twitter much more often.  =)
Happy 4th of July!!!  I'm proud to be an American  =)
Apparently this is a crime I've committed a lot recently: "Hey, come see Toy Story 3." "Sorry, I haven't seen 1 or 2." "What?!?!" ...My bad!
@marketmotivated Haha, which they're not at the moment!  I should work on that...  =)
Wow... one month since my last tweet!  I'm slowly failing as a tweeter...  =\
The sun is up, the birds are chirping.. what a beautiful Sunday!
Girls' night tonight!  Catching up with great friends and watching the first Sex in the City movie in preparation for next weekend!
Wow - it's Friday again already!  And I'm actually, miraculously, wide awake at 6:30 in the morning... This bodes well for the day!
I had a great birthday weekend (thanks for all the birthday wishes!) but now have to get back to reality and check off my To Do List items..
Amazing training day today = a great start to my birthday! Now on to clean my room (I want to begin my 20s "refreshed") & then to celebrate!
@evahnsan Thanks Evan!  You were awesome!  I'd heard The Soloists play before but had never heard your acoustic music; it was very good!
I'm glad I was able to hear my friends play tonight!  If you haven't heard The Soloists, then you should check them out on myspace!
Happy Mother's Day!!!  I love you, Mom!!
@emilytoto I actually just took a walk to the St. Louis Arch and read my book on the grass underneath it!  It was very relaxing.  =)
Regarding the Nashville Flooding..my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. I have family in Tennessee so I share in the concern!
@Hungryseagull I wish we had done the East Coast as well.  But I'm grateful for the opportunity to do the Midwest at least!
Happy Cinco de Mayo!  A day of Mexican food, fiestas, and general felicidad!
On tour with Smucker's Stars On Ice for a bit!!!  Get your tickets; it's such a fun show!
It's been awhile since I've been on Twitter... Hi!  Life is good.
Finally back home in the U.S.!!!  Man, it's good to be back!
In Italy!!  What a gorgeous country, and what amazing food!
Leaving for Italy tomorrow!!!  I cannot wait!  The food, the language, the people, the culture... amazing!  And, of course, competing too!
@brianmcguinty The secret is to spend your free time in the company of people you love & to not sweat the small stuff...then the week flies!
One week from today we will be on our way to Italy!!!  I absolutely cannot wait!
It's Thursday already!  I know on Facebook on Tuesday I said it was a long week but wow it's flown by much quicker than I thought it would.
@kbmama You're right... or Tuesday, as I'm finding this morning!  Tomorrow's another day, though; perhaps no coffee then? =)
@TCMTurner Are you coming to U of M?!?!  really??!  If so, that's so exciting!  Congratulations!
Coffee, coffee, coffee... definitely could not get through Monday morning without you!
Watching the Oscars for perhaps the first time ever... I can't remember watching in the past!
Done for the weekend!!!  Now time to rest, relax, and recover!
@punkrocker62107 As to aspiring Olympians, I would say put 110% into training every day b/c once you get there it is worth every minute!  =)
@punkrocker62107 The hockey game was amazing!  The best game I've ever been to (though I've only been to 3 so that's not saying much!)
@lauraluo Yeah actually Jackie is one of my best friends!  I've known her and Abby for years. Please tell Abby I say hi!!  =)
It's a Friday!  Yay!!!
I apologize for not responding to everyone who's tried to contact me in the past month... will get back to you all as soon as I can!
Back home again and at the rink!  Suffering partly from Post-Olympic Depression and partly from Back-Home Elation - an interesting combo.
Going to the USA-Canada hockey game!!!  Ah!!  =D
Congrats to all the ladies who skated their long programs tonight!  It was an amazing event to watch.  =)
GOOD LUCK TO RACHAEL AND MIRAI!!!  Last figure skating event of the Olympics tonight!
Hockey and short track made for a very long but definitely fun day today!
@ellenbryna "canada: america's snowy sombrero." -jon stewert.  &lt;--  haha, love it!
And a huge congrats to the ladies last night for spectacular short programs!  I'll be cheering you on for the long!
It's raining again!  And now, when I want to watch events!  Bah - one soaked Olympian coming right up!
Congrats to all my fellow ice dancers, but specifically Meryl & Charlie, Tessa & Scott, and Tanith & Ben! Way to represent North America!
Oh, and before I forget, check out our new website at http://samuelsonbates.us  =)
Last competition tonight!  So excited for the free dance.. only a few more hours now!
My thoughts and prayers and with Joannie Rochette and her family during this hard time; we're all here for you.
Compulsory dance in about 5.5 hours... I can't wait!  So ready to get out there in front of the Olympic crowd!
A huge congrats to Evan Lysacek!!!  Olympic champion!  And all the other U.S. men were amazing as well; we love you Jeremy and Johnny!!!!
My family has landed in Vancouver!!!  Ah, I'm so glad to have them here!
Skating 14th in the compulsory!  Good draw!!
The Proctor & Gamble House in Vancouver is so cool! I truly appreciate all they've done for us; specifically the 'Thank You, Mom' program!
Men's Short was very interesting tonight!  Congrats to all the U.S. guys!!
Day off today!!!  Time to sight-see, watch the other events, and relax a bit!
A huge thanks to all the police and volunteers who have sacrificed so much of their time to help us athletes... you guys are amazing!  =)
One more practice today!  Going to head to the dining hall to grab some food before leaving for the rink.
Long day of practice, now off to the dining hall and then to bed for a good night's rest!!  Congrats to the US athletes who competed today!
Congrats to Team USA - 4 medals on Day 1!!!  Let's keep it up! In E&E news, practice went well today but now I'm exhausted & ready for bed.
This is the first time I've had internet while here!  Will try to update more.  Everything is amazing so far.  GO TEAM USA!!!
Today is the day! Leaving for the airport & before I know it we'll be in Vancouver! It still hasn't hit me.. I'm going to the Oympics... Wow
@icedancecom I got it, thank you so much!  I have my new camera & will contact her if there are problems.  Also I have back-up skates ready!
@TCMTurner haha, it's so true!  =P
And... commence packing.  Less than 24 hours until we're in Vancouver!
Awake and ready for our last day of skating before we leave!
Today I will be doing battle with Mother Nature; huge snowstorm expected through which I need to drive at least 90 mins. Bring on the snow!
My car alarm has gone off the past two nights in a row... midnight 2 days ago, 2:30 A.M. last night.. I just want to sleep!
Only 3 days until we leave!  I just want to be there already!!!
Chores and errands today... and perhaps starting to pack.  5 more days 'til we leave!!!
@icedancecom It doesn't feel real at all yet!  What feels more real right now is the pile of laundry waiting for me to clean it!!  =)
@KanikapilaAZ I do know Connie, actually!  She skates at the Ann Arbor Ice Cube with us!
I sincerely apologize to everyone to whom I need to respond (whether on Facebook, via e-mail, on Twitter, my voicemail).. I've been so busy!
9 days left until Opening Ceremonies... we're in the single digits now!!
... It's only Tuesday!  How did that happen?!  It's good though; there's a lot of the week left to get things done!
@jamesonice I know, I'm glad to know it's actually me here on Twitter and not someone else!  haha
@iceyfrostbidden The Michigan Cherry... I like it!  Thanks for all the support!!
I'm officially ready to start another week!  Well, give me about 2 hours and then I will be officially ready to start the week!
Day off today... had a pancake brunch (though more like lunch) with some of my best friends!!  Nice and relaxing.
And it's Friday!  Great day of training yesterday and hoping for an equally great day today!
Wishing the best of luck to all skaters competing at the Four Continents Championships in Korea right now!!!
@icedancecom Yep!  Back at the Ann Arbor Ice Cube to train for the next 16 days before leaving for Vancouver.  =)  Is there a second me?
It's freezing cold in Michigan.  Definitely colder than Spokane.  And the time change makes me think it's 5:00 A.M.  I guess I need coffee!
is finally home in Ann Arbor and so glad to be back!!!
is so honored to be a member of the 2010 Olympic Team!  It's still exceedingly surreal...
Awake a little earlier than normal today for practice at a different rink but at least it's a Friday and I have coffee!
Best of luck to the U.S. Men and Pairs and all the Canadian skaters competing in their respective Nationals this weekend!
Only one week until we leave for Nationals!!!  It is coming up way too fast!
I know we've had 11 days of the new year already but one of my many resolutions is to update Twitter & Facebook more...so, hi! Life is good.
Thank you all for the luck and support at Skate Canada!  @xxhannah18 @Kirsten_Galea @skating102 @rubyred1231
Tonight is lobster night at the Samuelson cottage!  Ah, I love lobster!
It's Black Friday!  Which means I am sitting at home in my pjs at 11:00 a.m. doing puzzles and reading books.  What a lovely morning!
I am thankful for my family and my friends, who have always been there through my ups and downs with school and skating. Happy Thanksgiving!
My puppies have grown up so much in the past few months!  If only I wasn't allergic to them, I could shower them with love.
Leaving for Skate Canada today and very excited!
Paper #2... Here we go!
@TCMTurner Glad you're back!
It's the weekend!  And I'm actually in that "schoolwork mode" so today should be very productive!
Ready for another week
Scooby-Doo is so classic.. it makes me happy that it's on right now!  Ah, nostalgia.  =)
haha, I suppose that works @jacowan!
Slamming my forehead into a wall in the first 5 minutes I was awake was NOT one of the things I wanted to do today.
So exhausted... Time to go to bed!  And it's only 10, but I can't resist my tiredness any longer.
I will get a lot done today, I will get a lot done today, (I need to keep telling myself this), I will get a lot done today,
Time: there's not enough of it.  It's time for me to prioritize my long list of Things To Do.
Jet lag means waking up at 4:30 despite your best efforts to sleep until 10 a.m.
in Paris for TEB!!!
For some reason my body thinks it's acceptable to wake up at 6:47 a.m. on my day to sleep in when I never get up that early normally
So busy and stressed.  Why is there so much to do on a daily basis?!
Wow, I don't update Twitter very much... I guess I'm just more used to Facebook.  GO BLUE today!!!
Time to study... I don't know how I always end up with loads of homework
Psych is on tonight!  =)
First day of Fall 09 classes!
I love mornings when I'm not obligated to do anything... so relaxing!  Happy Labor Day!
About to eat dinner and then dance around the apartment cleaning!
Go Blue!!!  =D
It's a Friday and life is good!
Memories of 2007 JW have come flooding back... you never realize how fast your life can change until it does.
Not the greatest night in terms of sleep... woke up about 3 hours earlier than I wanted to and 2 hours earlier than I needed to.
I'm so glad it's a FRIDAY!!
So a mosquito found it's way into the sleeve of my sweatshirt yesterday... my left arm is now very itchy.
The fact that blueberries and cherries were so much in season this year makes me happy!
I really really hate lace bite.  It's one of those rare injuries skaters can get that takes forever to recover from.
@jamesonice Agreed!  Where are you thinking of going off to this time?
My mom and sisters come to visit me tomorrow!  Can't wait to see them again!!!
@rubyred1231 Yes, I finally have a break!  Classes start again on the 8th of Sept so it's a pretty lengthy break as well!
Going to my first murder-mystery party tonight... very excited!
Forgot to set an alarm last night but, Thank God, actually woke up 3 minutes before the non-existant alarm should have gone off!
Econ final in 5 hours.... almost done!!!
@RachaelFlatt Whoa, that's so exciting - Harvard and Dartmouth!  If you ever come to see U of M let me know... you guys can stay with me!
Class in the summer = being removed from the world for the next 36 hours as I cram for my Econ final.  Sorry if you're trying to reach me!
@jacowan It is indeed!  Congrats on the FD, btw!
@jacowan Omg, Are you serious?!  I'll have to watch out for those Lake Placid ones then.  I hope she's ok!!  And good luck today to you!
The mosquito bite on my foot is going to be very uncomfortable in my skates...
I would like to wish all the Lake Placid competitors the best of luck this week!!!
Second Econ quiz today, 6 pm.  I'll be studying until 5:59
Time to study... why can't I have a photographic memory?!?
I've actually been very productive lately: finishing homework, paying bills, cleaning.  It's not exciting, but at least it's getting done!
@amadeo0401 True, I'll keep that in mind!  Such as when I sit at my computer and sip coffee every morning while checking twitter...  =)
@SkateGreat2010 In a good way?  I hope so!  I miss you Eliot!!!
@jamesonice lol, are you serious?!  I'm hoping you've seen a doctor now though so your knee isn't stuck backwards!
I feel like I should update my twitter more often but currently I really have nothing to tweet about.
@jamesonice wait, are you serious?!  are you ok??
I know I should expect it because it comes nearly every week but skating has made me so sore this Monday!
TGIF!!!  It's the weekend!!!  =D
Finally a day with no class!  Skating and then RELAXING!
Going to spend a girls' night with the roomies!  I'm pretty sure we're seeing Ghosts of Girlfriends Past - gotta love the dollar theater!
@RachaelFlatt not too bad actually!  At least I didn't think so.. I don't know about the score yet!
Very wet.  But I suppose that's what happens at a pool party!
I love the Ann Arbor Art Fair!  But it makes parking atrocious.
ahh!  First econ 102 midterm tomorrow!!!  time to study...
@SkateGreat2010 haHA!  Geese!  =D
is feeling better and back on the ice
@lil_sev Thanks Sev!
@RachaelFlatt that's great to hear!!!  Is there any way I can get one of them?... after you decide which you like of course!
feels utterly drained.
@TCMTurner Thanks Tommy!
@amelia555 Thank you!
is sick.  =(
I am excited for today!  and tomorrow.  and saturday.  =)
trying to study for my first Econ quiz tomorrow... wish me luck!
