It‚Äôs better to know how something will fill the space! And you can use it to teach kids about rulers &amp; measurement, too! #MakeItHappen #ad
My last trick is all about measuring! When you‚Äôre building or creating anything, make sure to create a mock-up first! #MakeItHappen #ad

@cynthiarae72 Cynthia!  You just made my day!  I am so happy that you are inspired!  Keep me posted!
