@OscarDolls @TheAcademy Really? I never knew this existed! And as for the dress, to be honest, I believe I bought it off the rack at Neiman Marcus!

@MsJoelyFisher Penny and Carrie are together in heaven, dishing and having a grand old time. RIP.

I looked up "unidimensional" and it says "having one dimension." Sign language linguists and thousands of deaf people would disagree. And am I also correct in assuming that your labeling that way means it is not a full fledged language, equal in standing to any spoken language? https://t.co/9VMwFhGFll
Well, you "may' have your views and I "may" have mine. Ahem. BTW, as a person who is deaf, I "should" and can have my views if I feel they misrepresent thousands of Deaf people I know and many thousands more I've met in my travels. How did that sound, everyone? 😉 https://t.co/WZFrIaR1zz
@laurspag @nytimes Millions of us who are deaf do not consider ourselves "impaired." The consensus is we are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. What is the idea of "hearing impaired" if but to describe someone who has a hearing loss, is hard of hearing of just deaf? :)
@EinAugenschmaus @NyleDiMarco @VancityJax It's not balanced, it uses improper terminology and makes those people who are deaf and who sign appear not normal. Not a balanced article at all.
If penning an article about deaf people please do NOT use the term "hearing impaired" Secondly, millions of deaf people who sign deserve a balanced look at signs vs cochlear implants. Your article makes deaf people who sign as not normal; NOT TRUE https://t.co/2j4BSPEOzw @nytimes

Pls RT. Regardless of your political views, Hillary Clinton was a First Lady.  But no Helen Keller!? An inspiration to the WORLD and pioneer for disability, deaf and blind rights, not worthy of a page in your history books? To the @TXSBOE: this is contemptible. SHAME ON YOU. https://t.co/i2NfIuhYZ8
#AMJoy is when you start your Saturday and see that #deafoutloud is #1 on @iTunes Reality TV Charts! Please keep on downloading, watching! And THANK YOU for supporting!! @AETV @BunimMurray https://t.co/Ec9Lrj8cGy
The interview was originally broadcast captioned. And YOU have the power with Tweets &amp; posts to tell @KTLAMorningNews that the @YouTube post does not. Meanwhile, I shall continue to remind them until they do as I have ALWAYS done when it comes to lack of captions. Thank you. 🙏🏻 https://t.co/bh5LfgX3W2
It was my pleasure @missmayim . It's been too long since we've crossed paths (since we've become moms!). I hope we do sometime soon. Best, Marlee https://t.co/VO99Hq5Iue
Remember, if you missed #DeafOutLoud you can purchase it on @iTunes and @amazon. And speaking of @iTunes, the show made the Top TV Shows charts! Way to go @BunimMurray and @aetv! https://t.co/iSNt46lZnr
I hope you enjoyed #deafoutloud. If you did, please tell @aetv. They'd love your feedback! Thank you @BunimMurray &amp; @aetv for giving #TheMansfieldFamily #TheGarciaFamily &amp; #ThePosnerFamily a platform. They are awesome 3 families out of 35M Americans who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing!
In addition to #DeafOutLoud tonight which I'm very proud of, it's another special day in our home. It's our son, Brandon's, 18th birthday. Born,  9/12/00. B, you’ve shown me and Dad nothing but everything we want for a son like you. We love you SO MUCH, son. Happy birthday! 🤟🏼
Tonight at 8 pm on @aetv, meet the families of #DeafOutLoud.  #TheMansfieldFamily #TheGarciaFamily &amp; #ThePosnerFamily.  https://t.co/RR27geAcG3

You would've thought I produced this show, the way I'm promoting it. Wait, I DID! 😆 From the producers of #bornthisway, please watch #DeafOutLoud, about three DIFFERENT Deaf families. It's fascinating and it will touch your heart. Watch September 12, 8/7C PM on @aetv! https://t.co/TyYxA2yS60

Seems the "R word" is back in the news. Two years ago when it was alleged that our President referred to me this way, I posted this. It's also why I produced the special #DeafOutLoud to show America that Deaf people deserve respect and equality; that we each have a story to tell. https://t.co/up3Gyq64Gz
@CSiriano Fabulous!
Just over a week to watch #TheMansfieldFamily #TheGarciaFamily and #ThePosnerFamily on "DeafOutLoud." 3 Deaf families, each with a unique story to tell, each with an incredible journey. I'm very proud of this documentary special. Watch September 12 at 8 PM on @aetv. #deafoutloud https://t.co/4LZkFiw6aY

There aren't many people who can say they shared a dressing room with the Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin, but I can! Then both @Tom_Bergeron and I watched in awe as she sang on Fox After Breakfast stage. Yes, I'm deaf but she touched my SOUL. My prayers are with her &amp; her family.

A "win" for authenticity in film whether transgendered, disabled or Deaf. Yes, ANYONE should be able to make art; we shouldn't deny that. But let's improve the track record of authenticity in Hollywood casting. Bravo #scarlettJohansson! https://t.co/1VhwrHrNBt via @DEADLINE

@ACLU I applaud @NAD1880 and @ACLU for this shout out about Deaf prisoners and their lack of accessibility. This needs to be fixed!
This happens EVERY DAY. Deaf, hard of hearing and people with disabilties who are incarcerated have to deal with a bureaucracy that has NO IDEA that deaf, hard of hearing and disabled people HAVE RIGHTS. Ssadly, the people don't know their rights as well. https://t.co/7qrjgUhFNW

@texasjenny @maisyfantaisy Correct. Sign language is not international. But we can use gesture to try to communicate with each other and that’s worked for me and many others.
If any one has information about any of the detainees - particularly the children separated from their families - whether or not there may be people who are Deaf? Are they able to communicate? Are there interpreters? LMK. #detained #immigrantchildren
Thinking of all the special dads in my life. My father, Don, who I miss every day; @hwinkler4real who’s been like a second dad to me; and my husband, Kevin. We love you! 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻#Happyfathersday2018 https://t.co/mE5R2TcUeQ

I didn't suggest Henry would be deaf. I just suggested he play a role where he uses sign language to talk with me. 😉 https://t.co/zfd99VhPW8
Better for Henry just to be his hearing self but to communicate in sign, e.g. talking with someone who's deaf like me. These days it's better for deaf actors to play deaf roles. It's more authentic that way! 😉 https://t.co/FVJ2wjIW41

@TDFNYC Good to know. I would encourage looking into supertitles then. They work wonderfully and are superior to side captions! PS Thanks for the quick reply.

Bravo @HalLuftig and the  production team of @LesserGodBway for providing supertitles. For me, I found them the best way to see theater if interpreters/signs are not available and MUCH better than clunky hand held caption devices! @TDFNYC take a hint - this was GREAT.
So proud of the cast, crew and  production team for the revival of @LesserGodBway. I wish I could be there for Opening Night but my friend (and producer) @NyleDiMarco was kind enough to invite me to the first night’s preview. Thank you all! Break fingers and legs! https://t.co/Dhd1ea0yR5

You may not know who Nanette Fabray was but she was one of the earliest proponents of sign language on TV. She advocated for the deaf and hard of hearing because she lived with being deaf. RIP Nanette Fabray, Stage And TV Comic Actress. She was was 97. https://t.co/5SZJORrsEZ…

You're kidding? Sign language is not funny and facial expressions are part of conveying affect and meaning. Please find something else funny https://t.co/hMkPQgUN5E
Comments like "give the guy a break, he's trying" or "what other choice do they have?" Um, how about CAPTIONS? It's life and death after all

. @maresp601 😥💔
@WendyGlosser  Happy to engage. But lets think. If millions were offended, regardless of intent, isn't an apology needed? We never heard one
@wendyglosser. Better to not be deaf and keep your eyes open. We can disagree but running away or closing the door accomplishes nothing. :(
#LawEnforcementAppreciationDay To my husband, in honor of his 30 years of service and work and all those who serve, thank you.
I AM surprised that there is a refusal to acknowledge how millions of people with disabilities saw it and were offended. Ok? Enough for now. https://t.co/bPRjrJyPLQ
You're talking with someone who is Deaf. And I have MANY friends with disabilities. Believe me, WE know the truth. https://t.co/pd6oe6FKwV
Here's what I'd tell my child: making fun of someone with a disability isn't right. And whatever is in your heart, deeds matter. DO good.
How do we replace a symbol recognizable the WORLD OVER? One that denotes accessibility for ALL who have barriers? https://t.co/5mQeEaOt57
Wonderful to see a touching and moving story, diverse and truthful, win the @goldenglobes for Best Picture, Drama. Congrats @moonlightmov
That's it @lalaland. The best. So HAPPY for all the actors and filmmakers. A well deserved honor. @goldenglobes
Another YAY!! #EmmaStone for @lalaland. I said it when I saw the movie for the first time and told her so afterwards. She is BRILLIANT!
I'd rather watch her and tell the TRUTH how someone mocked the disabled. Is mocking a person with disability POLITICS? #MerylStreep. https://t.co/2mBVGRgElk
Congratulations #DamienChazelle!! @LaLaLand @goldenglobes SWEEP!
SPEAK THE TRUTH! I LOVE #MerylStreep. BTW, what took so long for her to be honored by @goldenglobes? She is a GODDESS. I am in AWE.

. @maresp601 It's about being GOOD &amp; authentic. Your use of "but" invalidates every actor of color, LGBTQ &amp; disability.
. @maresp601 If that's what they wanted.  But the EFFORT should be made -particularly when it comes to disabled and deaf roles
The definition of "acting" and "pretending" has evolved. From race, to disability &amp; sexual preference &amp; identity, #authenticity is IN.
Well @Piscesboy69  In your definition of "acting"  can a caucasian play Asian or African American? I mean, all you need is makeup...Ahem
. @maresp601 I think those are great actors you mention. Again I take it case by case but always prefer authenticity! Cheers!
RT @melodybledsoe @MarleeMatlin silence is the last thing the world will ever hear from you though, right? 🎉 &gt; One of my favorite tweets! :)
. @michaelarden As far as that director - when @655Jack asked if people believed Al Pancino was blind in Scent of a Woman, she blanched. LOL
. @michaelarden Ohhh. The critic also said I won out of pity. And NY Magazine said I'd never work again because I didn't "talk." Go figure!
. @1EllenIsAmazing The actors you mention are GREAT &amp; DESERVING of accolades. But when possible I like authenticity too like on @ABCFsab.
. @michaelarden How come? :)
. @1EllenIsAmazing  SIGH.  I have never asked to be hired simply for my identity. Read my lips. I ask for AUTHENTICITY and ABILITY.
. @crousetvh @TheVirginiaHome So excited to be meeting all of you with my friend and mentor, @hwinkler4real We've got great stories for you!
. @1EllenIsAmazing  Again, interesting. Someone who feels I support reverse discrimination. I DON'T. I support #AUTHENTICITY &amp; #ABILITY
@1EllenIsAmazing Interesting too. I believe all efforts, when possible, should be exercised to hire authentic people for disabled roles.
I once met for non-speaking  but hearing role. The director said audiences would see "Marlee Matlin" &amp; not the role. Interesting...
I don't think response was anything but ignorance. "Acting" has changed. Diversity in writing AND casting in more the norm - I HOPE!
I go by #hireauthentic   After winning the Oscar, some said I was a deaf person in a deaf role, so how was that "acting"? SMH.
Let's Discuss: Diversity &amp; disability in TV. Is a disabled ROLE enough? Or is it right thing to HIRE an actor with a disability to play it?
. @ncaprio There you go! It's all those kids I've had. Apparently each one zaps 20 percent of your memory! LOL.
. @ncaprio I know we've not met but I know you work with one of my favorite people, Beth Miller! Hope we can meet &amp; work together. Best, MM
I LOVE watching my friend @MsPattiPatti on @DancingABC. Tonight she was a SOUL MAMA! The Belle of New Orleans. And GREAT mom. xx MM

@AmmaralSayed64 I appreciate the opportunity for dialogue. My condolences. I know how hard it is to lose a parent. Peace and love.
@AmmaralSayed64 I try to do as much as I can  but as a working mom of 4, I can only do so much!
Dear  @AmmaralSayed64 I respect your views but they are two completely different issues in my opinion. Please don't confuse the two.  Peace.
. @JoshMalina So right about Meerkat. You and me both.
Dear @GovPenceIN People say I'm the most well known Deaf person out there. But from what I see on the news, looks you're deaf to equality.
Love this. #openforservice. Boycott is a good strategy but shouldn't we consider not hurting those who support equality?
. @legaleagle48 . We cannot know our future. We can only try and right the wrongs of the present and follow our hearts.
. @CarJackAMorFan And people have a right to sit at the counter, sit in the front of the bus and make noise whether they like it or not.
MLK did not boycott Selma. He WENT there, He STOOD his ground and made a change. Let's trend #MakeAChange and end religious bigotry.
A thought: Perhaps not #BoycottIndiana? Instead, go there, make noise &amp; say RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DOES NOT EQUAL DISCRIMINATION #MakeAChange
@AmyGuriya @goconstance @LeaKThompson Happy Friday! :)
Met this family in Cambodia and @starkeycares @starkeyhearing follows up with after care. Awesome! http://t.co/xWqwa1UIKI
Shame on those who believe that freedom of religion is reason for freedom to discriminate. #Indianabill is just wrong. A very sad day.
Happy Birthday @SJP. I didn't realize we were born in the same year.! We're turning 28 right?  :) Anyway, love to you and the family. xx

Nice to see #EmmettsDecision and #SwitchedAccident BOTH trending on Twitter. Congratulations to everyone involved with #SwitchedatBirth
Follow me &amp; @starkeyhearing and @starkeycares for a photo journal of our trip to CambodiaI So excited to meet the Deaf community there!
Thanks for Tweeting with me. I'm off to #Cambodia with @starkeyhearing to give out free hearing aids to kids. I'll Tweet from there! XX 💜
I love heart to heart #swister moments on #switchedatbirth! "You're gonna get through this" Meanwhile, see you soon when @abfsab returns!
#switchedaccident is trending! @ModelStella story is eye opening for sure! #SwitchedatBirth

How do you all like Mingo? #SwitchedatBirth
. @mrsandreataylor Social media is the best way to change things! #switchedatbirth
There has to be drama #SwitchedatBirth So keep watching when the 2nd of Season 4 returns to see consequences of #EmmettsDecision
"What happened to I'll always come find you?" #EmmettsDecision #SwitchedatBirth
#EmmettsDecision This is life changing! #SwitchedatBirth
Oh no Emmett! Bay! What's happening?? #SwitchedatBirth
That is a BEAUTIFUL shot of Bay at the beach #SwitchedatBirth
I'm so glad so many of you are eager to study sign and some of you to become interpreters! YOU inspire me!! #SwitchedatBirth
Lack of interpreters on weekends, no videophones - inexcusable and it's ILLEGAL but it HAPPENS to deaf ppl all the time! #SwitchedatBirth
This is based on a real life accident that @ModelStella "Natlaie" went through at the hospital with no interpreter. #SwitchedatBirth
Do you know it's not automatic that every deaf person who goes to the hospital gets an interpreter? It's the LAW and yet...#SwitchedatBirth
But what's the difference between Emmett writing about his relationship and Taylor Swift putting hers into her songs? Hmm? #SwitchedatBirth
. @Jacobin_Wisdom Unfortunately, it's very expensive to film the show outside of Los Angeles. #SwitchedatBirth
Do you think Emmett has the right to incorporate his relationship with Bay into his film? Artists do it all the time... #SwitchedatBirth
. @I_am_Me_2011 If I wasn't an actress..I'd own a store..clothing store, or maybe candy store! Like Dylan's Candy Bar. #SwitchedatBirth
. @Lola_dances My daughter is still exploring what to study in college seeing as it's her first year. #SwitchedatBirth
. @berry_sck I miss The L Word. I keep telling @ilenechaiken There should be a movie! But she's busy working on @EmpireFOX #SwitchedatBirth
. @nic_donzella I think Melody upports  Emmett being with anyone who makes him happy. Though Melody is awfully fond of Bay #SwitchedatBirth
. @k_nicole2017 My kids are hearing, and we sign and speak at home. #SwitchedatBirth
. @Vicki_McKernan_ Thank you!! #switchedatbirth.

For once, I'm glad there are no captions on broadcasts of the #SAE video. I can believe that racism is out there without having to read it.
Excited for new announcements from @tim_cook on #apple on new #applewatch. The "CC" symbol is there but there are no captions. :( #nowords
