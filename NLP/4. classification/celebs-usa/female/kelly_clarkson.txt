Aretha Franklin is the reason why I sing from that part deep inside of me that few could ever reach. She was my favorite and will always be. What a gift she has left all of us with her musical footprints. There will never be another like her. She was truly special. #QueenOfSoul

This is probably a dumb question but why doesn’t @Tesla install their solar energy capabilities on their cars? Then you could constantly be charging while driving. I’ve been wondering this for a while. There’s probably a great answer, but just curious. #LoveMyModelX 💁🏼‍♀️

so my assistant just pointed that in a previous tweet I forgot an "and" so a little correction, I would love to hang with her AND Carey, not just her Carey because that would be a strange thing to say to P!nk hahahaha! #GRAMMYsAskKelly

I had a complicated childhood and I never knew how to voice emotions properly for the longest time and that’s what first attracted me to this song. The song has no formula. It’s a rant of emotions, thoughts, and dreams all in one fell swoop. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Why by Annie Lennox has and will always be my favorite song to listen to. As a child I didn’t understand the lyrics but I felt them and it stirred up such a passion in me. That song made me feel like a grown woman before the age of 10. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I am so blessed with the most loving, creative, and honest environment and I’m thankful every day for it. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
My band and crew have always been the backbone to my entire organization because they’re all so talented, smart, and honest! I really am very blessed when it comes to people. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Our 2 nannies are invaluable and lovely! My assistant Tricia keeps my head above water while making me laugh. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
obviously Can't Touch This - MC Hammer 😜 https://t.co/Rjd8DACSpf
My family is amazing! My husband is a great partner. My kids are funny and smart. My sister, mom, and mother-in-law Lisa are incredibly helpful. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I Don't Think About You is basically my Braveheart "Freedom" moment for anyone in my life that has tried to break me 😆 #stillstanding #suckaaaasssss 😜 ....well, except he dies at the end 😐 so maybe a little different from that ha! #spoileralert https://t.co/Xi38ONFrrE
Respect yourself first and others will respect you. And if they don’t tell them thank you for showing me your true colors and making it easier to pick the weeds and keep the flowers. Ain’t nobody got time for weeds. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
We all have purpose. We all have meaning. These simple facts alone should make everyone on this planet feel a little bit like a superhero. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I focus on all the people in my life that lift me up instead of the ones trying to bring me down 🙂 https://t.co/LSo144SbV3
The one thing that moves me the most is kindness. It’s the simple things really. Kindness would solve a lot of issues this world is facing right now but there are quite a bit of us that are lead by fear instead. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Seriously, I cannot wait to make this playlist ha! #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Everything from “Thunder” (Imagine Dragons), to Possum Kingdom (The Toadies), to “If It Makes You Happy” (Sheryl Crow), to “Hustlin’ (Rick Ross), to “Never Loved a Man” (Aretha Franklin), to “Sign of the Times” (Harry Styles).  #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
If I had a playlist called “Meaning of Life” (which I now will start making because it’s an awesome idea, so thank you) I would have songs on it that make me feel alive and present. I’d have songs that I relate to on every emotional spectrum.  #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
For me, the words “If you want this love, gotta hold it tight” is a reminder to all of us that love is a precious thing that should be sacred and cherished, and not taken for granted. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I show love by bringing people together with my family and friends. I never want anyone to feel left out and I always want to make everyone feel special. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I think we all give love how we want to receive it. For example, I have abandonment issues so for me showing love is simply showing up, being there, and validating a persons existence, emotions, and moments.  #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Music is one of the most connecting things in this world. Melodies become nostalgic, and chords become emotions. It’s beautiful! #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Aretha, Whitney, and Mariah made me want to be singer with not only their catalogues of amazing songs, but the way they are so different yet so effective in the soulful/pop sound that it transcends genres and just makes you feel alive and inspired. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Rosemary Clooney and Ella Fitzgerald inspired me to love big band, jazz, and a level of musicianship that is incredible. Steven Tyler, Alanis Morissette, and The Toadies taught me how to let go of perfection and really truly emote. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I have always been passionate about music in a variety of genres. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Pride will only get you a fast pass to the “trapping oneself in a bathroom with the bible and a bottle of wine wondering when everything went wrong” kind of day. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Recognizing we still need our individuality as mothers will only make us better mothers, women, and members of society. No one can do everything. No one should have to do everything. So always remember to ask for or accept help. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
Both of these things can consume me at times. Whenever I meet a new mom and they ask me for advice I always say let go of trying to control everything and stop feeling guilty for wanting/needing moments for yourself. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
There are 2 things I am constantly working on as a mother. Control and guilt. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
What matters most to me is the health and happiness of my family and friends. What matters most to me is using the gifts and blessings I’ve been given to lift, support, and celebrate art, love, and connection. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife
I obviously haven’t found the Meaning of Life. I know we are all under construction but I am finding the older I get, the less renovating is happening. I keep things very simple in my life. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife

@alishamarie1993 me too!
@SkatingOnARiver is it weird that I have the same mug?? :)
@TNVOLINFL who doesn't??
Thank y'all so much for hangin' &amp; listening to #wrappedinred with me :) Merry Christmas!!
The acapella part at the end will always be my favorite. #silentnight
Not gonna lie. I listen 2 this all year long. Doesn't matter if it's June. I sang with @reba &amp; @trishayearwood #whoami :) #silentnight
Favorite part is the last "please" because I got so emotional it almost didn't come out. #ilovesadthingssometimes #justfornow
If you haven't heard @imogenheap original version please listen. Her voice is so beautiful &amp; honest, like crystal! #justfornow
.@imogenheap wrote such an honest song with this one. Not everybody wants to hear the truth but I love singing it. #justfornow
I wish y'all could have been in my brain movie while I was recording this. I had a whole scene playing out ha! #4carats
I wanted a fun, material girl kinda song for this album. Obviously this isn't what xmas is about but it's fun to pretend. #4carats
People just don't play like this anymore! What an amazing job the band/orchestra did?! #myfavoritethings
This is one of my favorites on the album but it's still no Julie Andrews. #original #myfavoritethings
I've always loved this song but I wanted to do something different with it. Hope y'all like it! #myfavoritethings
.@gregkurstin plays the &amp;#@! out of this piano solo! So talented!! #WhiteChristmas
There's nothing better than a classic Christmas song like White Christmas. :)
I LOVE the last chorus, right after the broken down section! #winterdreams
This song is a mix of quirky love &amp; my love for old school movie musicals. #winterdreams
I can totally see us older &amp; sitting on a porch in rocking chairs still singing this 2 my hubby :) @BBlackstock #winterdreams
If anyone tries to get you to stay like this... Run! They definitely might kill you or be slipping something into your drink haha :)
@dontouchmyidols nope. All the ones I wrote made it to this album. I had a lot of fun writing Christmas songs.
What a creepy yet awesome duet ha?!  #BabyItsColdOutside
Getting to sing with @ronniedunn was on my bucket list so check that off! He's so soulful! #babyitscoldoutside
@sharon457 tweet :)
@heyychelsayy haha yes! I had so much fun with @jasonhalbert recording different tones vocally to make it sound like a big gospel choir!
It's hard not to think of Elvis every time you hear this song. I bet you were already thinking about it ....yeah you were :) #BlueChristmas
@nicoleb21x we actually didn't record it that way @ 1st but then we did it acapella 4 a video teaser &amp; realized we had to change the ending.
The musicians on this song kill me every time I hear it! So tasteful! So talented! #BlueChristmas
Once again, background vocals are my favorite part. #EveryChristmas
@VictoriaLFisher thanks!!
Wrote this w/ my guitarist @abeneubanks &amp; it was amazing 2 see it grow from a simple piano/vocal 2 what it is now. #EveryChristmas
@mpulley2010 yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
Random little fact: My duet partner @benhaenow sang this on his season of X Factor. 1 of my fav Xmas songs!  #PleaseComeHomeForChristmas
@KCsoothesmysoul haha coal trouble is the worst!
Give me a mic &amp; a big, bluesy ballad &amp; I'm in heaven! #PleaseComeHomeForChristmas
@keatonrjones how cold you look is the main reason why I've never been to Chicago for Christmas :)
A little blues &amp; a little rock n roll never hurt anyone! That's all I'm sayin. #RunRunRudolph
This is my FAVORITE song off of this album to perform live! It is so much fun to sing! #RunRunRudolph
I wanted to sing this as is to honor its classic feel but I had to throw a little KC in there around 2:52 :)
The orchestra is insane! Wow! They're so effortless &amp; beautiful :) #HaveYourselfAMerryLittleChristmas
The saxophone solo &amp; the background vocals are my favorite parts of this song. #underneaththetree
I always feel like shopping when I hear this song ha! #underneaththetree
I still can't believe how fast this song came together with @gregkurstin. It was an amazing writing experience! #underneaththetree
Nothing cooler than writing a song you love with people you love more! @shanemcanally @ashleyarrison @abeneubanks #wrappedinred
I wrote this song based on a personal experience &amp; one of my favorite movies "Love Actually.” #wrappedinred
Cue up your albums and let's do this!
@vicrob222 haha I meant to type "vocal" not "coal"
@vicrob222 me too! Haven't had coal trouble in years. It figures it would happen on my favorite tour ha
@ismetkaramanKC ugh I'd probably cry. It's so sad &amp; I'm so pregnant &amp; hormonal haha
@vicrob222 thank you! I am a total nerd over any and all Christmas music :)
@saltire123 @GameOfThrones I LOVE Scotland &amp; we thought we'd bring some of our ancestry to one of our favorite shows :)

@CherylNapier thank you :) I was just telling my sis &amp; friend that I enjoyed our conversation! Have an awesome day!
@GettinSweenered @dixiechicks YESSS!!!!!! So excited for this!!!! Just made my day!!
@dunn1961 good Lord it was soooo cold!! Haha! Thanks for the drive :)
@eamitchell26 I understand this. It's sometimes hard to trust any of them because well, they're politicians.
@saltire123 @Alanis ugh so so great!
@CherylNapier agreed! It's funny to me that people who wanna save the planet don't count this as something that is so harmful 4 all of us!
@blakeshelton oh my gosh did I miss this before because this is awesome and hilarious hahaha!
@CherylNapier I believe he's a great candidate! Nice choice!
@TheBlazerGirl no shame in that honesty! That's why I love talking about it and learning from you guys as well. We all could use more info!
@MarilynHawk I like to reply to everyone because I think an open dialogue is what we all need although maybe not what we want to hear.
@Tylerrr987 could be true BUT playing devil's advocate here-my views from 10yrs ago have changed because I have evolved &amp; experienced more.
@KCAustralia yes
@CherylNapier I am with u on this! GMO's r horrible 4 the planet, animals, &amp; us! It's hard 2 find a candidate that we agree w/everything tho
@ProducerRondaK yes, Hillary, I thought you were responding from my Hillary tweet :)
@silkenbee touché haha
@Alostcelticsoul I like both of them but Ted is just too far right wing 4 me and Ben is smart but doesn't come off as a leader 2 me.
@ProducerRondaK I have voted dem&amp;rep before. I vote 4 who I think is best 4 us. I think she has the experience &amp; I like most of her agenda.
@le_marisa I love hearing other people's opinions and ideas! It's how we all educate ourselves and open our eyes to differences.
I would rather have an intelligent discussion than have an argument. Politics is a sensitive subject but we are smarter than being hateful.
@Alostcelticsoul totally respect your opinion. Who are you leaning towards and why?
@DrewMopar well then I guess it's not a big loss.
@AthRetrogirl give me your address. I'll send you a free copy :)
@lmward7 perhaps everyone should be vocal so we can have an open discussion and not be hateful and rude. Just a thought.
@KklovesMrDJ absolutely serious. Who are you leaning towards and why? Curious :)
@TheTruthHurtsRN Totally still have respect for your opinion but Hillary is not a socialist. Bernie is borderline. I'll give you that.
@le_marisa who are leaning towards? Curious??
@cbaker148 @Freeda99 I totally couldn't. I mean, I really really like me hahaha jk :)
@forhananim1 you could just not agree but that's cool.
@JayHallman haha! Best response. Obviously we differ in opinion. That's cool man :)
@ChristieLaDram that's okay, I can take it :) I just wish people could talk and communicate rather than be hateful and attack.
@Glanger816 agreed
@RostenVeronica oh my gosh you are probably so proud! What a beautiful thing it is to hear a child sing! So pure &amp;sweet! Tell her great job!
@DailyGregYouTub I respect your opinion &amp; I am never in Hollywood but okay.
@EvoyGoodman totally respect your opinion!
@AirForceWife475 the problem is that there was no question in your attack on me. Of course I support military. My family has fought 4 us.
@AirForceWife475 I'm not a limousine lib. I grew up w/nothing &amp; made something of myself &amp; am proud of that! My family doesn't mind sharing.
#TeamHillary but I do love Bernie as well! I want a Hillary/Bernie ticket!
Great debate! #DemocraticDebate
@KaceyMusgraves okay it appears your entire family is incredibly talented. Good gosh!

@tokiohotel I have never seen this &amp; apparently finding out through my publisher that the other writers didn't submit y'all as writers.
@tokiohotel oh my gosh are you for real?! I'm so sorry! Well props on writing/recording an amazing song &amp; sorry 4the mix up. Let's fix this!

It's a bummer that I wasn't given all the information and that it looks like I'm ripping them off because I would never do that 2 any artist
Also, they weren't included as writers of the song because I guess they didn't write it according 2 publishers.Not trying to disrespect them
Well, there's 2 versions of a great song! :)
Only version I've ever heard of Run Run Run was a piano/vocal by 1 of the writers that was sent to me 2 years ago??
Wow, just heard @tokiohotel version of Run Run Run! So great! Had never heard that before?! Some fans brought this to my attention.
