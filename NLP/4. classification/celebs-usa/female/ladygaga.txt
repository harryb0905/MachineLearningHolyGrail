@KimberlyNFoster @realDonaldTrump @POTUS looking for better resources so I can become more educated on how to be a productive ally
@xomanulani @KimberlyNFoster @realDonaldTrump @POTUS sincerely want to learn, more and more everyday on how to be a productive ally
Do you think @realDonaldTrump @POTUS saying "both sides are to blame" in #Charlottesville makes him a racist supporter? Yes or no?
For the Black Community, tell us ways the non-racist white community who loves u can do better to help influence the country? #HowWeDoBetter
. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  You should read my poll I have a lot of followers. https://t.co/59LcPxPWxJ
@POTUS did you feel the presidents speech just now was adequate and showed good leadership in response to racism?
@angry_mazapan @christosmonster @fuckm0nster I believe the overall plan toward harmony to be that simple
@fuckm0nster it's important to see reality even on the internet which studies show to be a negative climate. We have to fight w kindness
How do you think it's best to solve the worlds problems? #ItsNotUS #Charlottesville #BeKind
Tweet @realDonaldTrump &amp; tell him how you think he could #BeKind and be a better leader. #ThisIsNotUS #BeKind #Charlottesville #POTUS https://t.co/9tewk6rccf
. @realDonaldTrump too afraid to do the right thing cuz you will lose votes? Doesn't matter, younger generation has the answer to #BeKind.
I know we are not created to hate each other, but to help &amp; love. Use hashtag #BeKind #ThisIsNotUS to tweet positive messages. #Charlotte
I pray a true leader will rise to expel hatred from America. This is not US! This is Anti-American #ThisIsNotUS #Charlottesville #BeKind

Kindness, friends, &amp; resources matter to youth &amp; @BTWFoundation's research shows it. Read the #KindCommunitiesSurvey https://t.co/ss8LqdlEys
Within the Trans Community are many also who are strong &amp; brave.  They should be able to serve if they wish. To have honor if they do @POTUS
. @POTUS Sincerely, did you know of the group you singled out today, 45% of them ages (18 to 24) have attempted suicide already?
Many of these young people are transgender &amp; suffer daily from the exact types of social isolation &amp; targeting ur message encourages @POTUS
.@Potus Research says at least 1/2 of High School, University Students, &amp; Employed Young People rarely/never discuss mental issues w/ anyone
The message you have just sent has endangered the lives of people all over the United States and overseas bravely serving our nation @POTUS

@piersmorgan if you continue to shame me in the process of kindly agreeing to interview w/ u I'll happily do the interview with someone else
@piersmorgan Let's do that &amp; yes Mr. Morgan, I can handle u. Suprised you would question that. Was that the 1st question of our interview?
@piersmorgan if anyone in your family suffers from it, I pray they have more good days than bad. It has affected me &amp; my whole family.❤️✌️
@piersmorgan would also love to talk with you about PTSD, that it's not just a "military" disorder. There is a mental health youth epidemic.
@piersmorgan I've work w/ our VP Joe Biden on helping educate people about why women don't report, would love to share it w/ you some time.
@Madonna your speech at the Billboard Music Awards was inspiring. You're so brave &amp; strong. Thanks for being that for us girls we need that.

@Monster4Gaga24 no fighting people, it's not what we stand for. We stand for love, equality and respecting each other no matter what ✌🏾️✌🏼️
@Monster4Gaga24 U are absolutely right. But there's hateful extreme groups that he empowered that I fear will grow now that he won.
@Monster4Gaga24 @MarisolMonster The point is his language and approach to winning was divisive and we're witnessing it's violence now.
He empowered racist intolerant Americans to win.  Name-Calling and harassing is a form of celebration for Trump supporters today. @cnn https://t.co/ZZcmsNIRuL

@nicolexgaga nobody laughed but u thank u haha
@hopelessrocker @ViviLittleM I UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE TIME HELLO. Calling a vine a gif is funny! A fancy one at that! Nobody laughed, sadly.
@honeyMiich YAS u and I see it exactly the same
@BlackBoyMiah do i need to understand a pineapple to eat a banana.
@Pablonauta_ hmm I wouldn't say serious in quite good w a computer it's just this vine distinction were on about
@gagasgrande I just like talking to everyone it's interesting what people say
@HolyGagAllah but Isn't a "video" a series of moving photos that give the illusion of motion. And so are gifs.
@ViviLittleM gifs are not vines, but a vine could be an evolution of the gif no?
@skulltatttoo I'm trying to figure out why the distinction is so important.
@BxhindTheAura .gif + .gif + .gif + .gif + .gif + .gif  + music and maybe some FX or titles if u want = Vine am I getting warmer
@osnapitzgaga I think it has sound and is fancy!! WOW LOOK AT THAT TECHNOLOGY😂
@JustCallMeSeann is it like "jiff" y peanut butter or of the "guilty" g pronunciation
@Nutellandro but will this 6 second .gif with music change the world I don't know. Weird to hear it called technology. Communication maybe?
@jessicxh or perhaps a "fancy .gif"
@GagaSlaysUU @arparetyma so it's a gif w sound
@arparetyma isn't vine a company and .gif is what inspired vine? Or am I missing something important
