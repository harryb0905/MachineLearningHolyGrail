How very extra MONDAY or you, Monday. (Complete with fake blood from a recent fight scene) https://t.co/PkDN2ZwbGK
@DirkNorwell I like your style.
@ChrisCMecteau IN WHAT WORLD DO THESE EXIST AND CAN I MOVE THERE IMMEDIATELY, PLEASE?
Just keepin’ it classy with cheese-flavored crackers in bed! 😂😂😂. RT @oneletterfilms: @RachelNichols1 Rachel Nichols. Hollywood glamour. Synonymous. :)
Nothing says MONDAY quite like your water bottle emptying itself out in your purse on the way to the doctor’s office, eh?
Tell me I’m not currently the definition of “Lazy Sunday”...and I will show you the SVU marathon on TV and my bedside bowl of Cheez-Its. https://t.co/vNvHrHqCNk
Haven’t seen it yet...but now I absolutely will. RT @garretdillahunt: Olivia Colman in The Favourite....my pick.   As much love as she is getting,  she should be getting a TON more.    Unsolicited opinion.
#myhero RT @_thechrissmith_:@RachelNichols1 For once I remained calm and politely told him that he could either get off his phone or I was going to tell my friend Rachel. I followed up with, she is a trained fighter and he doesn’t want you to get involved. He stopped immediately.
NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. Yell at that driver! RT @_thechrissmith_: If I don’t make it, just know it wasn’t my fault. It was my Uber driver texting while driving. #safedriving
@DebbieTthespian I kept my eyes closed the entire time...and meditated...and concentrated on my breathing. It was unbearable, but necessary.
Who says I can’t wink?!?!? RT @kershaw_m: This Sunday crew, the best!   @RachelNichols1  alexander_lapointe  paulmichaelrahn @ Soho House West Hollywood https://t.co/Xtn18LsG8W
Who’s severely claustrophobic? I am!  Who just had an MRI? I did!  Who feels like they we’re in a very loud coffin for 45 minutes? Me!  Who wants wine? THIS GIRL RIGHT HERE!
Oh my goodness - something amazing happened: I became a creature randomly seen in nature...I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO GOT TO THE AIRPORT EARLY ENOUGH TO GET A MANICURE AT THE AIRPORT! Holy crap. This may (will) never happen again. I had to share...otherwise it never happened.
Happy Valentine’s Day to my handsome husband and best friend, @kershaw_m. I love you. #everything https://t.co/HCSNauoFKy
BUT...You know when you’re on a plane and the headphone jack in your seat doesn’t work with your personal headphones? Buy the shitty airline headphones and they’ll work every time! RT @bodinaren: @RachelNichols1 Clearly not...you would've thrown them away...because they're shit.
Somehow I have three pairs of airline headphones in my purse. Clearly, I never travel. 😂🤣🤦🏼‍♀️.
The “marauding gang of caffeinated hippos” strikes again, eh? I know them all too well. RT @chelahhorsdal: Just described myself as 'feeling like I’ve been trampled by a marauding gang of caffeinated hippos' in case you're wondering about the glamour of working in television.
It does not... RT @LaurenMcM90: @RachelNichols1 But does it beat left over pizza...?
Nothing says Friday quite like eating an old sandwich for breakfast...
My husband @kershaw_m and I have a wonderful friend. He needs our help and yours if you can contribute. 💔💔💔. RT @VDOOZER: This is Sam. He was Ted on SCRUBS. He’s a pal. Just had his first baby. Get involved if you can.  I am. https://t.co/nV1Zd9PdiN

Thanks to khaleesi_les I have one picture from yesterday. Not sure quite why I look like ET, but I’ll take it! https://t.co/xHwqeguL3V
What a fun day it was for @kershaw_m and me to celebrate @valeriewaters - a positive light and inspiration to everyone she touches. A very special thanks to @beautycounterhq for making it… https://t.co/gNsvopRPQa
Things discussed on set today so far: 1. Why pantyhose are the worst. 2. How nostril zits really hurt. 3. Tater tots are terrible when cold. 4. The pronunciation of “dirndl”.  Friday is off to a wonderfully eclectic start!
@paxton_nam Neither!
@PaulClayton1977 Hmmmm...weasel faced arse?
@PaulClayton1977 Invisible. It’s more useful.
@Vickpen510 Adios sunshine!
@starjumper9 @oneletterfilms Brought in a small snake I found outside in the garden...it escaped from the home I made and was never seen or heard from again.
@IndyEaglesFreak I’m originally from Maine, sooooooo...
@briggs_thomas Lose the ability to lie.
YESSSSSSSS! RT @_thechrissmith_: @RachelNichols1 can you come home and let’s have grilled cheese, tomato soup and I don’t know, maybe some Cheetos? #therainmakesmehungry
How. I’d rather know how. RT @r6meyers: @RachelNichols1 Would you rather know the date you will die, or how you will die?
I fear birds, so a giant bird is a solid NOPE! RT @HeidlageJohnJ: @RachelNichols1 Would you rather fight 10 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck?
@ghrules69 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 poison ivy, I guess, but...🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.
@jk_powell Back in time. For sure.
This might be the best one yet! You know me so well. But I NEED SWEATPANTS, so...no more wine in bed. RT @soldiergrrll: @RachelNichols1 Would you rather never drink wine in bed again or never be able to wear sweatpants again
@DebbieTthespian Good one. Jail for a year for something I didn’t do.
@john_costin Flying would be more fun, but invisible would be more useful, so...I choose invisible.
I lost a little snake in my house when I was about seven and I had nightmares for years and a forever-fear of snakes, so...I’d want to find the snake for sure! RT @oneletterfilms: @RachelNichols1 Would you rather find a snake in your house or not find the snake in your house?
@AlexPeacock8 Showers. Hands down.
Going NO DESSERTS would be good for my waistline! RT @borntorun1975: @RachelNichols1 Would you rather go without all your devices for a year or no desserts for a year?
@Magnet611 Oh my gosh...this one is really tough for me. Really tough! Um...blargh...ummmmm...I’m gonna have to go with ledge, but I’m still cringing...
Oh dear. And yikes. I’ll go with EYE because I think it would be easier to get all of the syrup out. You? RT @MetalMacGyver: @RachelNichols1 Have maple syrup poured in your eye? Or in your ear?
I think you should watch this. I am. Then we can discuss how phenomenal it is. ❤️ for @joncassar.  RT @joncassar: Please watch my #Netflix series #Medici. You won't be disappointed. https://t.co/ukxIakk00D
I’m playing “Would You Rather” via text with some friends. I need to conquer them with my options. Send help. Or, better yet, send suggestions. Please. Canadians are very good at this game.
@cstumpf750 Thanks, TIPS. Sweet sentence composition.
@aarongnear I had to print something out!
@Joey_Mele1 On the keyboard!
@E_C_Gordon Oh dear!
@tkreidl Nope.
To the jack-wang who found it funny to switch some letter keys around on the business computer at the hotel: I deeply dislike you. The number of times I spelled Nidhozs instead of Nichols (among other words with “c”s and “z”s) without noticing until I was done is infuriating.
SONG OF THE DAY: “When U Love Somebody” by Fruit Bats.
Sometimes you get a job...and then your very talented peers become your family. I consider myself so very blessed to have these gems in my life. Thanks, CONTINUUM.… https://t.co/Mm7D1adHCw
One of my all-time favorites. #TheSunAlsoRises   RT @DailyHemingway: Isn't it pretty to think so.
My husband made me breakfast. And brought it to me in bed. Sunday has been won, folks.
@Two_Lions Well, aren’t you the sweetest! Thank you. Hello to you and your teenager!
@dacabass @KiloOscarZulu I ALWAYS TIP!
@MisterDudz Out of nowhere...only the speakers in the kitchen sparked up and started playing the Bruce Springsteen music station. How does this happen?
So extremely well-played I can’t even find the words...😂😂😂. RT @TheGreatMerman: @RachelNichols1 Well, you did let Kirk trick you into downloading a virus to help him cheat at the Kobayashi Maru...so, not surprised 😁😁  (Yes, I saw the deleted scenes 😁😁)
I miss these ladies! Next time in Vancouver we will...  @kenziehewins (on the left) @Shewins10 (not pictured) Sarah (I don’t have her IG handle) https://t.co/8i9YAk0yYO

#WrongRachelNichols - bye. RT @nba_Jordan89: @tjimenez85 @RachelNichols1 @ZachLowe_NBA Yeah it was deleted lol.
Not that I really need an excuse to stay in my house all day, but I feel like everyone I know in LA is sick, so I’ve got to hunker down and stay healthy before I go back to work. Is the zombie apocalypse coming?
@IndyEaglesFreak 😘😘😘😘😘
@IndyEaglesFreak If I like the script and I like the character and I like the people involved, I want to join the team and play the role. CONTINUUM was (initially) only a Canadian show...and then it ended up in 133 territories. I would never be deterred because of an out-of-the-box viewing venue.
😂🤣😂! RT @ACKamas: @RachelNichols1 My parents didn’t have Alexa when I was a kid...they had me. “Alex, go change the channel.”  “Alex, turn up the tv.”  Etc....
💯 RT @KiloOscarZulu: @RachelNichols1 Do you think the houseservice crew at the hotel judges yous after you leave?
So some of you will call me a big wimp, but some of you will understand that it’s 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius) in my home and I find it super-chilly, but also awesome. Bring on the sweats and UGGs! I may even get the fire going. The “winter” options are limitless!
Don’t worry about me...just a neophyte trying to talk to Alexa and Siri and not making any headway with the level of the volume on my TV. Clearly, I wasn’t cut from the cloth of this fancy period in time. I miss The Pony Express.
Solid opinion. I do have some macaroons left... RT @DanJBalkwill: @RachelNichols1 Just saying... https://t.co/BhkIEk76wz
Given the fact that I’m departing Vancouver today, it has become apparent that the refrigerator in my room has served as nothing but a graveyard for leftover room service and takeout. How do we feel about shrimp salad, spicy chicken pizza or perhaps chicken fingers for breakfast?
Someone needs to get him a map...and MANY geography lessons. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️.   Please.
I KNEW IT!!!!! RT @dnadot: @RachelNichols1 It was just me, I was running around the block randomly changing clothes just to high five you over and over again :)
Yes, I’m that girl; the UGGs and sweatpants say “I got up at 4:30am for work” while the still-attached false eyelashes say “I like to keep it classy from the neck up”...also...ripping them off without cleanser hurts and I don’t feel like losing any original eyelashes right now.
✅ RT @hadleyk: @RachelNichols1 hit up @taissafarmiga she is there rocking her pats garb too!!! #youtellem
Thank goodness I remembered to bring one of my Patriots sweatshirts to Vancouver. It’s fun getting high-fives from random people!
I’m just a girl...looking for a HOCKEY WIVES marathon.
THIS IS AMAZING! Can I please steal “forgetful winning” from you? RT @Rabid_weasel576: @RachelNichols1 That is called forgetful winning
I have a terrible memory. Terrible. But sometimes it works in my favor. I just found a box of macaroons from last night in my jacket pocket and now I have breakfast...
Awwwww! Thank you! RT @amusic20: Continuum. An underrated Canadian sci fi series starring the amazing @RachelNichols1
Ahhhhhh it’s good to be back! And by “glam” I mean sweatpants, French Onion soup, and an SVU marathon in my hotel room, just to be clear. 🥳😋😉. https://t.co/aSz8wOtKNN
Here’s something I never thought I’d say, especially in JANUARY:  “The weather here in Vancouver is nicer than the current weather in LA!”   😂🥳🤣.
@Sighthoundgrace @FutureBringer You are clearly bionic! I’m impressed.
@Michael72002 May the best team win! I pride myself on never being a sore loser or an a**hole winner.
RT @FutureBringer: @RachelNichols1 With a Timmies in hand 🇨🇦Oh Canada🇨🇦...actually, as shocking as it may read, I don’t drink caffeine (save the occasional energy drink during a night-shoot)! So no coffee for me...
I LOVE THAT HAT!!!!!!!! Give your amazing daughter a squeeze from me! She is clearly awesome. RT @DirkNorwell: @RachelNichols1 Keeping warm in my new hat my daughter bought in NYC ... Go Pats https://t.co/eeHDvlwBs8
Wow - that’s so sweet of you to Tweet! I really appreciate it! Glad you enjoyed the show! RT @vverb: @RachelNichols1 Rachel I finished watching Titans. You were absolutely wonderful 👍👍
I’m not gonna lie; it was a cold, dark and rainy day in LA, so I put on my Canada toque, paired it with some woolly socks, and revved up the fireplace...so now I have become a permanent part of the sofa.
Let’s (keep) go(ing), Patriots! https://t.co/f24XmJ6wrZ
Laughter and bubbles! RT @_thechrissmith_: @RachelNichols1 Imagine if as soon as you opened your front door to say hi, I just threw a grilled cheese into your face.  Would you be angry or could we just laugh about it over a glass of bubbles? #idreamofthrowinggrilledcheeses
Come throw a grilled cheese into my face. I’ll chill the champs. RT @_thechrissmith_: @RachelNichols1 Do you have to be so sweet this early? I just finished having a grilled cheese and coffee, could this day get any better?  I miss you, even though I saw you like 3 days ago. ♥️
@clairec007 Very. Clever. 😊
It’s raining in LA. It’s also chilly. So...I find that wearing my sweatshirt birthday gift from magsies_ and @kershaw_m’s Canada hat is the best way to spend the morning... https://t.co/RrEpBuxSVi
So many wonderful birthday messages from all of you! Many thanks for making me feel so special! It was a lovely birthday; low key and cozy.

@nysa1812 Aha! That makes more sense. I thought you were being oddly critical of me...

I love watching @60Minutes - always smart, always inquisitive, always entertaining, always educating...and always the perfect Sunday evening nightcap.
Story of my life...except it’s ill-fitting clam diggers and flip flops with an ugly cardigan over top. RT @KarenKilgariff: The hot look this winter will be an ugly coat thrown over pajamas because someone’s blocking the driveway
You know me so well! 🙋🏼‍♀️. RT @NicholasKalikow: @Sorrowscopes Hey @RachelNichols1 this one is for you!
So...um...how does one wake up with the cacophony of Bob Marley’s “Jammin” mixed with “Belle” from Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” stuck in one’s head? What was I dreaming about? Should I be concerned? Brains are funny...
Congratulations to the USA for the win against Russia in the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships semi-final game! Next up - who will it be? *Switzerland* or Finland? (I apologize for my mistake)

Went to sleep watching THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL last night. Subsequently had a dream that I got a stand-up comedy gig. Woke up this morning sweaty and riddled with anxiety about my upcoming debut on the stand-up stage. Took a solid minute for me to realize it was all a dream...

Well, I was having a lovely solo lunch at a Chinese restaurant until the fortune in my cookie read “A CHALLENGE IS NEAR”. I hope it just means the challenge will be zipping my pants after all the holiday eating I’ve done! RT @deadcon8: Good Afternoon Tweeters. How's it Going?
Oof. 😳. Wish me luck! https://t.co/JejzfWCLH5

I am 💯 with you on this...yet haven’t mastered the talent. RT @TheNardvark: When you’re cutting wrapping paper and your scissors start to glide is what I imagine heroin feels like.

Ahhhhhhhhmazing! RT @600seEggs: @RachelNichols1 Watching an episode from Continuum, spouse says, "Isn't that the villain from The Librarians?" Slowly your recognition continues to grow.

Oh heck yes! Christmas puzzle season has begun! It’s my favorite time of the year... https://t.co/HAmagQT9On
I absolutely agree. Stunt performers deserve recognition. RT @theterrychen: Stunt performers should absolutely be recognized and prioritized for their efforts. Who else has the potential of risking their lives on set? Much respect to all the stunties, they’re a special breed.
Dear cauliflower,  I admit, I have been rude to you. I said some unkind words about your existence and new-found popularity. But when you snuck into my bacon mac-n-cheese last night...I was not mad. You were crispy and delicious.  Please accept my apology, Rachel.
Awwwwww! Thank you! So very kind. 😘🥰😘. RT @NataliaMndez4: from my favorite series of all time (@CrimMinds_CBS ) to the most recent addition to the favorites list( @DCUTitans) It's always a pleasure to see you acting @RachelNichols1 https://t.co/P28fWsJXCl

Word to the wise: Don’t try to untangle headphones in the dark. Nothing good will come from an excursion of this sort. I speak from personal experience. You’re welcome.
It’s a whole new kind of character for me to play! #SuperFun RT @RealWillConvey: Just started watching the latest episode of Titans.....and just had OH MY GOD! ITS Kiera Cameron! When I realised that @RachelNichols1 was Rachel's mum
So...my goal for today was to not leave the house. I failed. I left the house and walked into the bar we built in our garage.
Awwwwwww! You’re so sweet. Thank you! And I absolutely adore Val. RT @jeanmobilia: @RachelNichols1 @deadcon8 You've been busy Rachel!  We share a mutual friend, so I've become a fan--she speaks so highly of you.  (Val).  I'll keep my eye peeled for these films.  😊

❤️. RT @CobaltAzurean: @RachelNichols1 I've ran into two teachers from my high school since moving back to western Maine, and while they didn't remember me (which is fine...), I think they enjoyed the fact that I remembered them after being away for nearly twenty years.
❤️. RT @omgitsbreXO: @RachelNichols1 Yes!!! Agreed!!! Especially since my two favorite teachers back in high school influenced me to love education, and now I’m working in it! Couldn’t be more grateful for them!
❤️. RT @michaeldevault: @RachelNichols1 I try to keep in touch with all the teachers who made a difference in my life. It means so much to me and to them that we have become friends.
Hey @nicholasferroni - look what I’m sending to one of my favorite teachers for a Happy Holidays Card... * #BeGratefulForGreatTeachers https://t.co/vk7KFoijrl
I went to see one of my favorite teachers when I was in Maine. We had tea, homemade cookies and wonderful conversation. Today I received a card from her, saying how much she appreciated the visit. My first thought was “I should do things like this more often”. We all should.
His former students still thank him when they see him. Most of them would tell me “Your father taught me to love reading!” - I will never forget how proud that made me! RT @NicholasFerroni: @RachelNichols1 @escopaperco I can imagine how many your father would have received 🙌🍎🙏
FACT: you’re never too old to suffer a brain-freeze as the result of consuming ice cream too quickly...
I love these! RT @NicholasFerroni: The “thank you” cards that teachers deserve by @escopaperco: https://t.co/9GcrS1mgpK #teacherappreciation365

We need to do a show on this, Ben! I’ll do whatever it takes to get the ball rolling. I mean, I love all the praise I get for THE JUMP, but...😂. RT @ESPN_Ben44: @Rachel__Nichols @katienolan @RachelNichols1 Here we go again...Katie - seems like a perfect segment for Always Late.
My mother and I read the books and went to the movies together. I own all of them! It’s nice to escape into the world of HP enchantment... RT @AceMc122: @RachelNichols1 had no idea you were a Potterhead. Doppppppppppe.
Today feels like the perfect day for a HARRY POTTER marathon...but, ugh, I have to adult.
Do any of you, in times of anxiety, resort to hair-straightening as a coping mechanism...or is that just awkward me? Not even asking for a friend. Straight up asking for me.

It was a wonderful weekend with hayleygenevieve and @hunterjamesnick - I got to play my favorite role: Aunt Rachel. Harper is the sweetest pea. And she only peed on me twice!!!!! https://t.co/y58IUAk358

@mysteryldy59 😘
OH MY GAWD I AM “NIFTY”! Day made. RT @scrib: @RachelNichols1 Home playing Jeopardy!?  Sweetheart, you just passed cool and hit NIFTY. ;)
In case you ever thought I was cool, I would just like everyone to know that I’m home “playing” JEOPARDY all by myself...and keeping track of my own score. Send me 9,000 cats, a bowl of porridge, and a closet of mumus...and I’m the spitting image of my deceased great grandmother.
My sister-in-law recommended THE BABADOOK! RT @bwodders: @RachelNichols1 The Witch. It Follows. The Babadook.
You’re the first to recommend THE CONJURING and I’ve heard it’s solid... RT @robertjdown: @RachelNichols1 @kershaw_m Just watched The Conjuring a couple of days ago, solid horror film
Haha - that’s amazing! Small world indeed! RT @FrancoisMarc: @RachelNichols1 @JabariDavisNBA @ABCNetwork I do, I do!! 😂 This is random as hell, but I just realized I totally know your husband. Met in Phoenix at Lodging Conference. LA is way too small.

@omgitsbreXO Love always wins, lady!!!!!!!
@Danowelch Hahaahahaaahahahahahahahahah!
Waittttttttttttttt! The clear ones? I always thought pineapple...but this apple idea is blowing my mind! RT @Lucretia9000: @RachelNichols1 Can I have the apple or the pineapple ones? If they're the same, of course.
@omgitsbreXO You did it - you turned a dumpster fire into love! Warms my heart. Love is the way. Always.
@FrancoisMarc @JabariDavisNBA @ABCNetwork I think we’d have to get me on THE JUMP first. #WrongRachelNichols

@Karyn1282 Thanks, lovely lady. I appreciate the hugs from afar.
I’m here for you, lady! RT @salihech: @RachelNichols1 Ha! Dumpster fire day for me today, but I like your suggestion. Will get my bottle ready for the next good day. 😁
#AnyWinIsStillAWin. Love it! RT @ElizabethSEmery: @RachelNichols1 I get that all too well. And always look to the little goods too because they do add up (any win is still a win)
Today is good. But it’s OK that not all days are good days. Some days I feel like a dumpster fire, like on Wednesday when I found out I didn’t get a job that I really wanted. So, let’s try to bottle up the good when we’ve got it and use it to help extinguish our dumpster fires.
Goodnight. Dream sweet. Hold your best friend’s hand and go to sleep. https://t.co/X5T5yMNWcI

Yeah...so...I’m pretty sure when the phone rings and the display says “SCAM LIKELY” I can ignore the voicemail. I highly doubt the IRS is really calling me (using an automated system) about a lawsuit that has been filed on my behalf. 😂😂😂.

My husband just said the most beautiful thing to me: “We can order Chinese food for dinner.”   Bless his heart.  #verklempt.
Babe, you know me...do you really think I wouldn’t add bacon? 😋🤣😚. RT @spragueg: @RachelNichols1 ADD BACON
@natalieroseway1 Hiiiiiiiiiiiii! And helloooooooooooo!
Having a grilled cheese sandwich and a glass of red wine pretending I’m on the East Coast and it’s cold outside (even though it’s 80 degrees in LA right now) is totally OK, right?
Also me, but with chips... RT @XplodingUnicorn: Me: *proudly* I walked through the kitchen and I didn't eat any cookies.  Wife: We don't have any cookies.  Me: I ate them all last night.
@Aeries0 @kershaw_m Blahahahahahahahahahahah!

Got a call confirming a reservation. The lunch was not in my calendar. Yikes! With whom am I having lunch? Don’t know! So, I put myself together and went to the venue to find that I did not have a reservation...and they were fully booked for lunch. Hey McDonald’s, how you doin’?

I thought online ordering while drinking wine was a potentially perplexing decision, but online ordering while NyQuil-ing proved even more hilarious. 24 boxes of Puffs tissues with Vicks, a gravy boat, and the new Scrabble dictionary just arrived at my door.   🤔😳😑🧐😬.
Just had a fabulous meal at SLOANE’S (Valley Village) and felt compelled to share my experience. Great service. Delicious food. Lovely wines. Cozy atmosphere. Check it out! *THIS IS NOT… https://t.co/ybtr4Ae2rq
Living in a Vancouver, with it’s crisp fall climate, the NFL season was synonymous with making chili. Now, living in LA, our desire for football and chili has not waned, but crisp weather doesn’t exist, so we turn up the AC, close the blinds and...pretend it’s cold outside. 😬.
Describing the claw foot tubs in our bathrooms I said “They’re treacherous, but they’re so pretty.” to which my husband replied “Just like you.” I will take this as a compliment.
@Karyn1282 I am so sorry. I know there’s nothing I can say to make you feel better. I’m thinking of you during this difficult time. 💔😘💔.
Yes. This. I would like this immediately. RT @SofieHagen: Shazam but for strange noises in your house at night.
Yes, if I’m getting a chocolate chip cookie and you ask me to bring you one, I will absolutely bring you a cookie. However, in the interest of being honest, I will also absolutely keep the cookie with the most chocolate chips in it for myself.

@KLC2978 I greatly appreciate you reaching out and saying that to me. We all have battles...and we all need love and support to conquer them. Being able to be honest about our struggles without being shamed is an integral part of healing. Be kind. It’s easy.
@niallmulholland You’re so sweet. Thank you!

Love yourself. You’re worth it. https://t.co/OBB5AS0VYm
@FlamesFan84 I’m with you.
@djmouse1978 You’re sweet. All hugs welcome. Big or small. I just want to make a conscious effort to be more compassionate and kind and understanding. People who are suffering need kindness, not shaming. #BeKindItsEasy
@FlamesFan84 Good for you for acknowledging that you needed help AND getting the help you needed. The world is better with you in it. Let’s continue to be kind and sympathetic...it’s easy.
@nard_410 Thank you.
@Seabee201 Clearly you don’t understand addiction...probably because you don’t have any firsthand experience with it...consider yourself lucky, but don’t be a douche canoe.
@mr_e_guy @MegaAndy25 Hehe - sure! 😁😁😁.

@ian_armstrong @momkidschannel Thank you for saying that. The world is not an easy place for many people right now. #BeKindItsEasy
@gp5367 Anyone who needs help should be able to get help without being shamed...
@Susan45429 The fact that you can say this means that you don’t have any idea what addiction really is...consider yourself lucky.
You just made my night by saying that. Thank you. I’m going to go to sleep now and send all the love I can to anyone in this whole world who is struggling right now. You are all in my thoughts. ❤️❤️❤️. RT @KLC2978: @RachelNichols1 Best.Tweet.Ever.
@momkidschannel Sending you love, kindness, understanding, and support. ❤️❤️❤️.
@momkidschannel #kindnessmatters - just keep that in your heart.
@MLBFan1991 We are adults. Conversation is key. I don’t name-call or get hostile. I support an open forum. Communication is the key, whether or not we agree. Thank you for being lovely and honest.
@momkidschannel My thoughts are with you and your family at this difficult time. I’m so sorry for your loss.
@DrSlats Let’s send love and support and high hopes that she gets the treatment she needs. No negativity. Just love. She didn’t choose this struggle. Nobody would. Positivity abound.
@MLBFan1991 Of course. I don’t penalize people who have different opinions than I do...provided that we can peacefully agree to disagree. The world continues to spin, right? You’re a class act, even though our views may be different. I have no reason remove myself from your friendship.
@EvansHemsPratt I couldn’t have said it better myself. Thank you for your eloquence. Sometimes that which looks pretty on the outside is anything but pretty on the inside. That’s why I say; BE KIND. IT’S EASY. Compassion is the name of the game...
@JennHolton Sending love. ❤️.
@DrSlats So let’s be here for her (and anyone else who’s struggling) right now...and send nothing but love and support and heartfelt wishes for a complete recovery. Let’s make it clear that all we have to share is love and understanding. Deal?
@MLBFan1991 I appreciate your candor. Thank you.
Thank you. RT @paulclap: @RachelNichols1 Reason 456,765 that I love you!  So we’ll said. Xxx
@MLBFan1991 When you lose (bury) a friend as a result of addiction, after you’ve done everything you can to save their life, let me know how you feel about addiction.
@mn_wintersend Also, be KIND to yourself. Do not judge yourself for the feelings you have. Seek the help that you need. There’s no shame in that game.
@mn_wintersend Thank you for sharing that. I really appreciate your honesty. Be well. Take care of yourself. You are in my thoughts:
@DrSlats Addiction is, mostly, a very lonely disease...a seasoned addict is a master at hiding vices and relapses...
@MLBFan1991 Clearly you don’t understand addiction. It’s not a choice.
LET’S MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR: - nobody chooses to be an addict - nobody chooses to be bipolar - nobody chooses to suffer from depression - nobody chooses to struggle with their mental health - nobody chooses to battle anxiety - nobody chooses to be suicidal  BE KIND. IT’S EASY.
And don’t get me confused WITH THE WRONG PERSON! RT @RoemelloScuggs: @RachelNichols1 @IzGutierrez Hate? Where was the hate? It is all facts....Dont get the two confused

Wanted to try a meal-prep delivery company. Got my first box from Hello Fresh. Looks legit. Have any of you tried it or have a different company you like? It was affordable and there won’t be any waste. I’m tired of throwing away produce that goes bad hanging out in my fridge...

@JedihomerT I like learning about people. Honestly, we struck up a conversation because he made room for me at the bar and I asked how his cheeseburger was...simple, easy, safe and enriching.
Yes, in today’s climate, people aren’t necessarily inclined to talk to strangers, but sometimes that’s how to meet supremely interesting people whose stories warm your heart and restore your faith in humanity. Thank you, nice grandfather at the Reno airport, you were a delight.

Ventured outside. Bold move. Accidentally inhaled some sort of strange cotton that was floating in the air. Toronto, help me out - what is this stuff? Anyway, it wasn’t one of my finer moments. Now I’m a one-woman sneeze-fest. That’s what I get for going on a walk. Never again!

Let’s all take care of each other. RT @acritas29: @RachelNichols1 Currently I shelter a friend who need talking
ABSOLUTELY. RT @coffeemeoften: @RachelNichols1 And for those who are not fighting depression, many who do suffer, can't reach out. If you see the signs, reach out. Offer help. Offer support. Listen. Be that friend.
Ok, Markinson. I accept your challenge. But I did just get misty-eyed during a Chevrolet commercial, so... RT @BrianMarkinson: @RachelNichols1 I have a challenge for you... au revoir, les enfants.  No way you make it through the last 30 seconds. No. Way.  Gauntlet thrown down RN!
When the last thing you feel like doing is talking...it’s likely the most important time to talk. You are valuable. You are loved. Your life is important. If you or someone you know needs help there is always somebody who will listen...  1-800-273-TALK
I don’t usually re-watch movies that I know are going to make me cry, but I will drop everything to re-watch the end of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
You are an inspiration. RT @NicholasFerroni: @RachelNichols1 Thank you, it means a lot coming from the daughter of an amazing teacher.
@DaveSteel9 @jk_powell It broke my heart, too.
It is a brilliant thing!!!!!!!! RT @hadleyk: @RachelNichols1 @lexpalm WHAT how did i know not know this is a thing!!!
@asmsanjee 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!
@sviekman @NetflixFilm Very sweet of you! Made my day! Thank you.
I’ll have to check it out! 😂😂😂. RT @jk_powell: @RachelNichols1 You should watch Continuum...I heard that it was pretty good.
THIS. RT @NicholasFerroni: That moment when you get to tell your student’s mom (who recently was evicted and lost her job) that 155 strangers donated over $5,000 to help her and her 2 boys get back on their feet. Thank you to everyone who made this happen. https://t.co/spyIIAYpB9
ABSOLUTELY. RT @lexpalm: Honestly, the best thing Apple ever did was add in the unsubscribe option at the top of mailing list emails.
Just ran into one of the incredibly lovely actresses that I’m currently working with as I rode the hotel elevator. She looked stunning and was heading to the gym. I looked like a hobo; disheveled, sporting sleep lines...and definitely not going to the gym.
@sviekman @NetflixFilm Thank you so much!
@FutureBringer 😂🤣😂
@mookiago @LibrariansTNT Awwwww! You’re sweet. Thank you!
I love how Netflix recommends watching THE OFFICE because I watched WILD WILD COUNTRY. I’m dying to know the correlation here...
The flight was packed! But I wanted the window and he wanted the aisle, so we rolled the dice... RT @BeatonJune: @RachelNichols1 I know how you feel - this has backfired on my husband and I also 😢
We miss you already, Jeff! Thanks for being wonderful! RT @JeffRoop1: Just finished up a guest spot on #____. Shout out to @RachelNichols1 for being a great acting partner and @majavrvilo an insightful, fun and collaborative director to work with. Best wishes the rest of the way.

Apparently it happens frequently in my parent’s home... RT @Darkshadow1980: @RachelNichols1 Lol chasing a flying squirrel, how often does that happen?
When I woke up today I had a text from my mother: “I’m chasing another f***ing flying squirrel around the house!” I am still giggling at the image of her armed with a broom and wearing some kind of “protective” outfit that likely included a hat/helmet of sorts. Moms are the best.

Do you remember when this was part of a commercial for Coca•Cola? RT @ForceSpectre: @RachelNichols1  https://t.co/F7ac4SCUJQ
The realization that, as a child, I believed jumping out of a plane with an inflatable raft was a life-saving idea while I was simultaneously deeply afraid of quicksand...leaves me with lots of questions about what was really happening in my child mind.
ONLY THE FIRST THREE! RT @alancostauk: @RachelNichols1 But are they the original trio of films which would be worth staying on the sofa for or the later ones which are not so essential
I thought I was making progress, but showering and putting on clothes and getting back in bed ON TOP OF THE SHEETS does not really qualify as progress. In my defense, there is an INDIANA JONES marathon on TV and the sofa is really uncomfortable...
Wouldn’t that be fun?!!??!?!?! RT @Quinn5777: @RachelNichols1 Would it be weird to say that you belong on @NBCTimeless ???? #Continuumrules
You know how sometimes you dig into a pocket and find money you didn’t know was there and it’s such a LOVELY surprise? Well, I just dug into a jacket pocket and found a phone charger and one sock...so that’s more of a WTF surprise.
We should host a night where we try to solve the DATELINE crime in between commercials... RT @OmariAkilNewton: @RachelNichols1 @amyleelavoie and I are ABOUT that Dateline life. Sounds like my dream evening. Hope you're well!
An inside look into my fancy and fabulous Friday night; me watching NHL Playoff Hockey in my hotel room and flipping to DATELINE during the intermission periods. Don’t be jealous.
I see what you did there... RT @fitzscott: @RachelNichols1 As a distracted dip, I appreciate not being executed.
But I didn’t in the end! RT @DjAaronB: @RachelNichols1 Naughty you.
Oh jeez. Buffalo sauce all over my phone and my sweatshirt. Never try to execute a distracted dip, people. Nobody wins. Warn your friends.

I will absolutely keep you posted! RT @BarryHod1: @RachelNichols1 @crowdrise You're very welcome. It's the least I can do. If you get ideas for other things (like signed #Continuum scripts, I have S1E1 signed script so another would be great) let me know. Cheers!

Heyyyyyyyyyy! My “oversight” wasn’t that bad! Just a LITTLE shake and a BIT of ash and a 💯 ruined hotdog! 😬. RT @UKEarper101: Why am I laughing so much at @RachelNichols1 making it on the moments bit, oh Rachel! 😂 https://t.co/OUbyV95TOC
Yes! Being nice and chill and understanding is so much better for our world than being an ass-hat. *This has been a Public Service Announcement.* RT @Denmac56: @RachelNichols1 @AceG32 Love wins again!  😀🤣😂
Thank you, Kristina. I appreciate your honesty. You get me. 😘. RT @TheFunkyCrew: @RachelNichols1 @mikedietsche I microwaved a sausage for 10 mins. I do hail from ex-Soviet block and never saw a microwave prior coming to university in Canada 😂😂

I know “jack-wang” was good, but “idiot ass-banana” is even better!
@BarryHod1 @LollipopTheater - thanks Barry - you’re great! We appreciate all the support. Let me find the right link for you! Hey @LollipopTheater - can you help?
Heck yeah! RT @mike_bollow: @RachelNichols1 @AceG32  https://t.co/Y0G76dD4pa
@exavierpope YUP! It was RUINED!
@mikedietsche ha! Sounds like me! I never had a microwave growing up...or in college...or in my first, second or third apartment.
Ha! That’s pretty rad of you. Your defense has been accepted. You are forgiven. I will lift the “jack-wang” from your name. 👍🏻. RT @AceG32: @RachelNichols1 In my defense...looking back on it... I realize I FORGOT the 😂 emoji after the Tweet. Haha!  #JackWagonConfessional #Oops
@Grunge_Girl7 good for you!
@mike_bollow right??!?!? I mean, c’mon people...FIND A SENSE OF HUMOR!
Some humorless jack-wang clearly took my funny-if-you-have-a-sense-of-humor Tweet about how I burned a foil hotdog-wrapper in the microwave way too seriously and his tool-bag followers (also lacking senses of humor) need to RELAX. (Except the one who called me a millennial...😂!)
I can accept that. RT @NicholasK_LA: Sorry @RachelNichols1 you’ll have to pay for your own sweatpants and single-malt scotch.
My wardrobe today is pajamas and a bathrobe with a side of slippers. No super-suit. No business suit. No zippers. No buttons. No hair extensions. Today at work is glorious. That is all.

PSA: the foil-paper that hotdogs are wrapped in is not meant to go in the microwave. It will catch fire and, even if caught before an epic disaster takes place, will ruin the taste of your snack, rendering it smoky, but not in a good way. Oops. We all know I’m no chef...

I feel old when:  1. I realize that my friend’s children are no longer babies...they are in MIDDLE SCHOOL.  2. When someone runs through set carrying a wet prop, saying “Smelly mat! Smelly mat!” and I put it to the tune of Phoebe’s “Smelly Cat” from FRIENDS...and NO ONE GETS IT.

I said “soup” twice during a phone call. Less than one minute later, I received an email: “The Soup Cleanse is the New Juice Cleanse”. So, not only was my call being “observed” (is that what we call it?), but apparently the way I said “soup” implied I needed weight-loss tips...

Who’s ready for the @LibrariansTNT Season Finale tonight? I know I am! I’ll try to LiveTweet (no spoilers!) with the East Coast if I am home in time, but I will definitely LiveTweet with the West Coast, so get ready...it’s going to be quite the thrill ride!
Funnnnnn! How’s it going? 😂😂😂. RT @lexpalm: I’ve spent most of the last two days hiding @RachelNichols1 Scarlett action figure in various spots on Courtney’s desk to see how long it takes her to notice.   This is what I call work.

My most sincere congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles! You played the better game tonight and you earned this win. Enjoy every minute. Please celebrate safely.

And I’m also horribly claustrophobic, so helmets are a REAL joy... RT @tsellman: @RachelNichols1 @deadcon8 I think you should add it to your resume : "Expert at wearing really big fake hazmat helmets" This one from Continuum S3! https://t.co/9iGBpTJL83
I made a side-dish tonight called “Green Beans Almondine” solely because, well, rhyming. That’s why.

Hello all of you lovely people! Just in case you didn’t know...Nicole Noone (yours truly) will be returning to @LibrariansTNT tonight! I wonder what she’s gonna do THIS time. Actually, no, I don’t wonder...I already know! Tune in and find out. You won’t be disappointed. 😉🧐🤫😏.

@ibookery I don’t know about the toothpaste, but the deodorant...is a big nope.
@Delirium64 Thank you! I may have to give it a try!
Since NATIVE DEODORANT is popping up all over my various social media pages I’m intrigued and curious about trying it, but I’m scared it’ll end up being a TOM’S OF MAINE experience. Can anyone help me navigate this arduous “pit stick” situation?
@MeisterShake Thank you for saying that! I really appreciate the compliment!
@miss_richmond haha! That’s amazing!
@mpauter #hero
Lots of food. RT @Tarawa: @RachelNichols1 What’s your favorite meal?
Now is not the appropriate time to eat beef jerky. I repeat, now is not the appropriate time to eat beef jerky.
@JackieMcQuade This wins. You win. I am damn impressed.
Joke’s on me. The new McDonald’s that seemingly opened-up overnight in my neighborhood...is pretend. It’s a film set. Phew.
Ha! Imagine if you’d just come up behind “me” and covered my eyes...SURPRISE! RT @clydetombaugh: At airport in NY. Hat. Hair. Wine. From behind I was convinced this was you @RachelNichols1! (It wasn’t) 😂 https://t.co/O0nmyyLjSr
QUICK QUESTION: what’s something that you wanted to do when you were a kid, but your parents wouldn’t let you...and now you’ve realized that you wouldn’t let your children do it either?  I used to want to pick up and keep random bird feathers I found outside...😫🤢🤓.
@perlar yes. Now. I would like all of it.
Somehow, miraculously, a McDonald’s has materialized, seemingly overnight, just a few blocks away from my residence. I am not ready for this kind of willpower test. It’s Monday...I HAVE NO WILLPOWER! Help me.
@timriggins28 it is not...
When I want to see if @kershaw_m is asleep...all I have to do is put his least favorite show on the TV in our bedroom (I love said show, he hates it, the show in question shall remain nameless) and see if he bolts upright demanding a channel change. Works every time. Dream sweet.

Anything with fake cheese flavoring (Cheezits, Cheetos)...or chips (all kinds and flavors)...and ice cream (preferably coffee, which is ironic because I don’t drink coffee). RT @andrewjan94: @RachelNichols1 Rachel What are your favorite junk foods?

@ssmith2010live I hope you like it!
I thought it would be super weird to sit down with my in-laws on the sofa after applying an @FrancescoClark beauty mask because my face would look so pale and they would inquire as to whether or not I was feeling ill.  They didn’t even notice.  Maybe they think I got a tan?
Oh dear...🤦🏼‍♀️.

I think the brand is WOOD WICK. They’re delicious! RT @AndrewWiskow: @RachelNichols1 I think I need this in my life. Where can I find them?
Cool! What happened? I wasn’t there... RT @RachKilgo: Watched the #ESPNMegacast for just long enough to love it and also know I couldn't watch any longer. @katienolan @SarahSpain @RachelNichols1 @MichelleDBeadle
@MarcNYY618 yeah...and not necessarily in a tasty way. 😂🤣😑🤢.
@FabledDamned AWWWWWWW! Thanks, Matt!
My mother gave me a candle with a wooden wick that sounds like a crackling fire when it burns and it is the best thing I have encountered in awhile. Oh, and it’s scented like leather and campfire, so there’s that, too.

Thank you, sweetie! You’re an inspiration! RT @NicholasFerroni: Happy birthday to one of my favorite people, ever. and someone who I am honored to call a friend, @RachelNichols1! You are an amazing actress and an even better person.
If you would like to know how I sported my fancy pants and painted the town red on my birthday, I will surely disappoint; so far, I tried to light a candle using a pair of scissors and then proceeded to eat tuna fish that, unbeknownst to me, had expired three days ago. Nailed it!
Aw! You guys are the best!  Thank you so much for taking the time to Tweet me on my birthday! I may not have a chance to reply to each one individually, but I have read and will continue to read all of your posts, smiling and feeling very fortunate.   😘🍾🎈🎂🎉🍰🥂🎁🍷❤️😍

@MoldyWarp I’m laughing so hard right now but trying not to move which must look super awkward as I’m trying not to disturb the sleeping husband.
@FerrisLawrence DO NOT ENCOURAGE HIM! 🤣😂🤣
SITUATION UPDATE: husband has now, adorably, fallen asleep on my shoulder, so this means I can reach the remote to change the channel. Phew! All is good.  (seconds later)  Oh good grief, now I CAN’T REACH MY WINE!!!!
Help! I was cleaning up the house in preparation for bed and I found my husband watching “Old School” in bed and won’t let me change the channel. This is a hostage situation!
@MarcNYY618 I, personally, like to have real conversations. I listen, I hear, I may disagree, but I contemplate and value every opinion. I don’t name-call and I don’t bully. Everyone deserves a platform. That’s the greatest thing about freedom of speech. We can all be heard.

@FerrisLawrence I’m a BIG fan of Colorado!
Twitter can be an aggressive forum, a double-edged sword, and a friend and ally simultaneously. However, when the parties involved are able to engage in an open, honest back-and-forth without name-calling and bullying...good things can happen. We can peacefully agree to disagree.
@lordemperorjim @eggleman @ziwe I’m IN! Call casting!
@mike_bollow This is why you like you. You’re honest. You’re true to yourself. You didn’t call me horrible names. You brought the discussion to the table. We engaged peacefully. I wish all of my interactions could be open like ours. We respect each other even if we disagree. 👌🏼
@eggleman @lordemperorjim @ziwe I’ll see you again in episode #6 and then again...
Marijuana is not heroin, Mr. Sessions. https://t.co/Yaj9KSkHOa
@mike_bollow I believe in tangible evidence. If you can’t prove it, don’t argue it. I don’t identify as a liberal or a conservative. I side with truth and justice, whatever it may be. That is all. You don’t know me. Don’t paint me into a stereotype because it fits your agenda.
WOW! That’s so sweet! I loved shooting the Librarians...and don’t worry, I come back at the end of the season! RT @lordemperorjim: @RachelNichols1 @ziwe You were great bye the way on the Librarians! You deserve your own show again!!
@mike_bollow it’s your argument...back it up with evidentiary support!
@mike_bollow @NicholasFerroni actually, coats/heat are an integral part of the original Tweet. I didn’t bring anything political into this interaction. I praised teachers for going above and beyond. You came out solely to attack. So now it’s YOUR way or the highway? Touché.
She calls out “E” while doing an interview on “E”. Wow. Good for her! RT @ziwe: DEBRA MESSING BRING THE MESS!!!! CALLING OUT A NETWORK ON THE VERY NETWORK ITSELF  https://t.co/ia9TBSVlek
@_nighttrap That’s so sweet! Thank you! 😘
This is my kind of card...@sniffpetcandles gives good card. Love you, lady. https://t.co/6CvKTx66pP
@mike_bollow @Turn_and_Tempo @NicholasFerroni I haven’t been in school recently, so I’m not qualified to answer this question to the fullest extent, but I can defend the teachers that I know and respect. They often do a thankless job, but are responsible for future generations...
@Turn_and_Tempo @mike_bollow @NicholasFerroni I can also type-in Bigfoot...
@mike_bollow Stopping children from freezing at school - that I can agree with!
@Turn_and_Tempo @mike_bollow @NicholasFerroni Send me proof of this aforementioned liberal agenda sweeping the nations schools. I have many friends who are incredible educators. They teach English, math, history, science and I don’t see anything wrong with these subjects. Do you?
@mike_bollow I was merely offering a suggestion. I’m perfectly qualified to have my own opinion, as are you. We are allowed to disagree. No part of this exchange needs to be disrespectful or dismissive.
@mike_bollow @Turn_and_Tempo @NicholasFerroni If you are unhappy with the free education they are getting you can always school them at home!
@creekbear HOW DARE THEY?!?!!?!?!?
@Tomwinchester56 😂🤣😂
@Turn_and_Tempo @mike_bollow @NicholasFerroni I am a proud product of the public school system. I had wonderful teachers. My father was a teacher. People STILL thank him for being such an impactful educator. You have no real proof to back up your statements. Have a lovely day.
@wing_hu @CrimMinds_CBS @WitchesEastEnd @RUSHonUSA @NBCChicagoFire @LibrariansTNT HELLO!

@talbot_ana @FitCoupleCooks I’ll check it out now!
Haha - that’s a great quote! RT @halcrown: @RachelNichols1 I hate to steal a line from TV but much like "chef" on the BBC "i learned to cook in self defense." So i understand i really do.
I’d love that. I’ll be your sous chef because at this point you’re a gourmet cook...and last night I made a simple stir-fry and the fact that no one died was a considerable achievement! RT @sadowski23: Dinner party at my house!
Nope! Found a recipe online! RT @DrWutt: @RachelNichols1 Was it Blue Apron?? Be honest. 😂
I made dinner! It was tasty. We both had a second helping. Neither of us was under duress upon making that decision. And as it stands right now, we are alive and well. I consider this a significant victory...especially since today was also the day I learned how to hard-boil eggs.
At least it’s not nowhere! RT @DrSlats: @RachelNichols1 Well congrats on your bag being.... somewhere!!
@mklopez @Rossiiii_27A @johnlarroquette NUTS! My bad.
Maybe my bag is having an existential crisis and doesn’t want to identify with being present at one singular location... RT @Rossiiii_27A: @RachelNichols1 So wait they found it but they don’t know where they found it? 🤔
AIR CANADA: Your lost bag has been found. ME: Yay! Where is it? AC: We do not know at this time. ME: But it’s in the system... AC: Yes. It’s in the system. It was supposed to arrive in LA on Tuesday, but we don’t have confirmation whether or not it arrived or where it is now. ME:
@KingAlfreddd YUMMMMMMMY!
@TrishaPopples This looks delish!
@sjh_canada I like where your head is at!
@TheEradicator01 I can make a really good lasagna, a quiche, chicken soup and apple pie...but I need to broaden my horizons.
@HugAddicted This looks great - and I’ll add some shredded chicken for a little extra protein!
@pearitheadjv I don’t...but I’m going to TRY!
Ok. So. I am putting my talent at making reservations on the back burner...in order to start cooking. I welcome any quick-and-healthy recipe suggestions you might have! And I promise not to jam my feed with pictures of food. I will only advertise the meals that I really screw up.
@CindyFu76609276 I sincerely enjoy interacting with lovely people like yourself...thank YOU. Your Tweet was a great way to send myself off to sleep with a smile on my face.
@GrtWhiteBfflo77 Your girls are very lucky to have a father like you!
Well aren’t you sweet! Thank you! RT @GrtWhiteBfflo77: Being a fellow Mainer, seeing @RachelNichols1 &amp; @AnnaKendrick47 success proves that hard work, dedication and determination pays off and it's not where you come from.

A cheeseburger is a cheeseburger...you’re speaking on a Quarter Pounder. 😋. RT @NicholasFerroni: Don’t they call them “Royale with cheese” in Vancouver? Are you not adopting any of Michael’s culture? 🤔
Remember that time I said I wasn’t going to sleep on the flight because I wanted to be exhausted and ready for bed when I got home? Yeah...about that...
Make them into temporary doorstops? RT @leitzkejs: @RachelNichols1 "If it weren't for pickles, what in the world would we do with all the cucumbers?"
@lanaya_nay I like where your head’s at!
They’ll do it in the States and Canada, but I’ve ordered the same in Europe multiple times and was brutally rebuffed. What a bummer. RT @chiefgarabaldi: @RachelNichols1 U can get it xtra cheese and pickles?? Wtf! They don't do that in the UK 😢
😶😏🤫. RT @desilvamarc: @RachelNichols1 Nice.  Did u get fries?
I was going to take a year-long break from fast food in 2018, but I just had two McDonalds cheeseburgers with extra cheese and extra pickle and I’ve come to the realization that I will never be able to quit them...
Dear @AirCanada - just so you know - you have a lovely, kind, understanding, and very diligent employee at Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport in Montréal. Her name is Carol. I didn’t get her last name, but I cannot possibly express what an asset she is to Air Canada. Thank you, Carol!
I know I’m not your mother, father, sibling or guardian, but please be safe tonight, lovely friends. Please be safe. Take care of yourselves and take care of those you love. I will be asleep before the clock ticks “Happy New Year”. Let’s welcome 2018 with positivity and kindness.

I like where your head’s at, but he’s six, so Beer Pong May be problematic. RT @chrisharvest1: @RachelNichols1 You cannot let this stand. You must challenge your cousin to a rematch in something you're better at.  Beer pong!

@Jenneel4Life Aw! Thank you so much for saying that! Very kind and greatly appreciated.
This is probably a horrible thing to admit, but...my favorite “Christmas with Santa” pictures are those in which at least one party involved is REALLY not happy to be there.
Indeed they are - I’m recurring this season! RT @AronGarrecht: @RachelNichols1 @LibrariansTNT Yeah, you rocked that, nice job on the accent, I hope they bring you back!
Yippeeeeeee! I hope you enjoy the premiere episode! RT @eggleman: @RachelNichols1 @LibrariansTNT and you're premiering here in the UK in 28 minutes !
@SouthernWaid I’d love to be back in the BAU!
Thank you all so much for the support and enthusiasm you Tweeted after my debut on @LibrariansTNT last night! Playing Nicole Noone is such incredible fun...especially because I get to work with a great group of people!

Thank you! So happy I didn’t disappoint! RT @musicalradiance: I knew we were getting Nicole back, but seeing it unfold before my eyes was amazing. Phenomenal job, @RachelNichols1 !!!
I adore you! We make such a fab team! RT @mmcdonaldlewis: @RachelNichols1 Awwww girl! My @RachelNichols1 was an amazing client, and much more importantly, a dear and grand friend. I adore you, Rachel!
Fair point... RT @Tarawa: @RachelNichols1 Try blowing out your birthday candles

Why, thank you! Flattery will get you everywhere... RT @SouthernWaid: @ChristianKane01 @RachelNichols1 She’s also crazy funny. I got to know her when she was on @CrimMinds_CBS and have loved her since.
Oh wait...maybe I’m not so bad after all...  #TheLibrarians  @librarianstnt
For those #Continuum fans out there, I have just one thing to say about Nicole Noone and The Librarians: IT’S COMPLICATED.  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣!
@kbachelder THANK YOU! Glad you’re enjoying it!
Ha! Simple mistake. Happens to the best of us! Thank you for your kind words! RT @yourordinaryman: Hi @RachelNichols1! You are doing a great job continuing the journey of Nicole 😊@Rachel__Nichols, hope ESPN is treating you well! #WrongRachel 😂#TheLibrarians
Exactly! RT @georgemoody228: @RachelNichols1 @LibrariansTNT  https://t.co/bwcpL1hauE
Fun fact: I have known @ChristianKane01 for many years, but I hadn’t seen him in 15 years until we started shooting #TheLibrarians together!

@AeolianMinor @LibrariansTNT Thank you! It is good to be back!
@Valder137 THANK YOU!
I might be a tad bitter... RT @NeverKnitDrunk: Do you date all of your guardians, or just the blond ones? 🔥🔥🔥 Pretty sure Noone is holding a grudge.  #TheLibrarians @RachelNichols1
Funny thing about Nicole. Her last name is Noone, but with just one space she becomes NICOLE NO ONE - kind of fitting for someone who has been locked away for ages and is 500 years old, right?  @librarianstnt #TheLibrarians
@Cricut365 right?!?!?
@cousino12 Thank you!
I look pretty good for 500 years old, eh?  @librarianstst #TheLibrarians
And working with you was so incredibly wonderful! I so greatly appreciated every minute. RT @Dean_Devlin: I’ve wanted to work with Rachel Nichols for ten years!! #thelibrarians

Oh hello there...prisoner...
Great way to start, in my opinion! 😊. RT @Paul_Hanlin_Jr: @RachelNichols1 @Dean_Devlin This is my first Librarians episode. Ever. 😊
@Thurston3rd watch the “new” one and tell me what you think...

That moment when you know you definitely put too much hot Chinese mustard on your egg roll and have to come to terms with the fact that your sinuses are about to be fully cleared out while your nose hairs burn and eyes run for the next 15 seconds. But it’s also delicious...

FRIENDS! HELP! I’ve been collecting bottle caps for @CapsOfLoveUSA - but now I have to find a recycling facility that will accept the polypropylene and polyethylene caps in exchange for a tax deductible donations payable to Caps Of Love. Can anyone help? I’ve got about 10K caps!
@cecilialuna yeah...not pretty.
I have a dental appointment for teeth-cleaning on Wednesday. Time to start flossing. Surely two days of extreme flossing will trick my hygienist.

With all the “My Sweet Audrina” talk on @MyFavMurder I remember that time I was allowed to read “Flowers in the Attic”, but the “Sweet Valley High” books were deemed inappropriate. Oops. Someone clearly wasn’t familiar with V.C. Andrews’ storylines...

...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand goodnight!
You know when you’re trying to be really quiet and not disturb your sleeping significant other, but you manage to drop two remote controls, spill wine, and viciously stub your toe? Well that, my friends, is the story of my life. It’s not pretty or graceful, but it’s how I roll...
That’s why I don’t call them out by their Twitter handle. I just write the handle down and pee on it before I flush! RT @2muchcoffee4me: @RachelNichols1 Just remember, if the douche-canoes (awesome, but...fuck-sticks) get to you, they win. Twitter is a breeding ground for them.
@lexpalm are you sick, my girl?
So many trolls...I’m just trying to be a positive person. RT @BeachDan: @RachelNichols1 🙌
Oh my goodness...so many douche-canoes, so little time, why waste my energy. Let’s all try and be nice people tomorrow, this week, this holiday season, and EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR. We are all human...we should believe in humanity.

@TheEradicator01 that ABSOLUTELY counts!
Hello friends,  In an effort to spread holiday cheer and help those in need, I am cleaning out my closet and bringing items that I no longer need to the nearest women’s shelter. If you have anything you don’t need or use, please consider donating them this holiday season!  Xxx.
@Piech42 the amount of sweat that I worked-up during that four-cushion wrestling session is super-gross. I am not proud. But I am honest.

PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED: I made dinner tonight.  Yes, it WAS soup, but it DID include chicken that I shredded and I also had to crack some eggs without getting their shells involved, so I consider this a triumph of epic proportions.  It’s the little things, eh?

@ace38 Never baby talk. I speak to my food like an adult...
Bought a roasted chicken for dinner. Snuck a bite because it smelled delicious...then proceeded to tell the chicken how delicious it was, out loud. I TALKED TO MY DINNER. If I didn’t already (thankfully) have a husband...I think my chances would be slim to none at this point.
