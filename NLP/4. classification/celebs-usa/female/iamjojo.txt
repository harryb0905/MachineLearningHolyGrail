How are you today?
There are patterns. Do you see? This is unacceptable. #SurvivingRKelly
We must acknowledge that today, in America, the color of a person’s skin + their/ their families socio-economic standing either ensures or denies them protection. Some people’s stories are prioritized &amp; believed over others. Some are blamed &amp; victim-shamed.
Im sure it’s way easier SAID than DONE to come forward when you see some wild shit going on right in front of you... but COME THE HELL ON. When dealing w child abuse can it become a reflex!???? SHIT!
Thank u @lifetimetv for this important docuseries #SurvivingKelly
I feel DEEPLY for these COURAGEOUS QUEENS who come forward and in some cases risk their lives 2share their story &amp;let others know they’re not alone!!!! Going up against powerful people/ entities fucking intimidating/ terrifying.
Becuase, if I didn’t have her, I could have easily fallen victim to someone like R Kelly. Period.
so so thankful 2have had my mom by my side (THANK U MOM I LOVE U MADLY) who 1- never left me alone for a second until I turned 18, 2- never let me work w R Kelly when I begged her to 3- never let me get too close to other predatory men who wanted to do who-knows-what to me
Many of these stories I was hearing when I, myself, was wayyyy underage. Making my first couple albums at 12 and then 14/15. I was a HUGEEEEE R Kelly fan, came from a broken home, had daddy issues, and wondered... how did these girls get chosen? I wondered if I could/would be.
... the R Kelly stories I’ve heard in sessions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
... and nobody came forward? seems like many continued 2make money off of him and stick around, thus condoning his disgusting predatory ways. Were they sticking around for more “ridiculous Robert Kelly stories” they could tell in private studio sessions later down the line?
To know that many men I’ve known throughout my career (women too, no doubt, but overwhelmingly more men 🤷‍♀️) worked so closely with R. Kelly and KNEW and in some cases SAW the abuse going on + told stories about this stuff in studio sessions like it was funny...

I felt hella pressure. Mostly that I put on myself. I felt suffocated by my own anxiety around it. Remaking my old stuff was cathartic, man... allowed me to tap into the carefree spirit I had as a kid. So good for making new music. Feeling more liberated/empowered than ever. https://t.co/xwCUwodTZW
It was great how was yours? Did you cop some limited edition merch by any chance? https://t.co/2IYUkvgLpB https://t.co/83MsTK2ncq
You won’t be able to find the original albums on any streaming services... which I why I re-recorded them in the first place. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/eWDahH8K7r
oh HELL YEAH I can to get back out there and see you all next year https://t.co/bVc08r0W7X

If I get the permission from my collaborators... I would love to officially release it. One of my favorite projects. @AustinBrown @tommyparker80s  #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/l5wXQuIKcy
The reproduction was done by Javad Day (Klynik) and Jordan Orvosh (@JordanXL) with some additional playing by @thekenjichan and Charles Norris III (dboychuck)... they KILLED IT!! #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/23UlcapnbK
I love you too babe. I remind myself that the only way OUT is THROUGH. Keep my head down and do the things I want/need to do even when I don’t believe I can. And then I look back and am like “U made it! You’re on the other side of it now! Aren’t u glad u DID?” #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/SWdeTdlwvQ
Mannnnnn!!!!!! It made me emotional re- cutting this one. In 2018???? WHEW. @Diane_Warren wrote this incredible song that rings even truer today. #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/pOziYb1yPW
that’s a great question. I wish I had the answers. #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/hVvpKBScUG
Thank U! Tbh I developed anxiety abt belting/ hitting super high notes that I’m still working through. Trying to “compete” with my 12/15 yr old voice is weird... BUT... I warm up/down, don’t smoke, stay hydrated, when on tour I avoid dairy and follow an anti inflammatory diet. ♥️ https://t.co/NhucGsarKJ
THANK YOU. I love you madly. Without you, there is no JoJo. (Did I just refer to myself in the third person? EW 🤢) #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/Eijoo9WohC
cringed about recording “the way you do me” cuz I realized how FUCKIN INAPPROPRIATE it was for me to have sang it at 15 😭🤯🤷‍♀️ #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/HogykaCK4O
🥰🥰🥰 https://t.co/mQnDQWpq0y
Yeah there were adlib choices that I made as a 12 or 15 year old that I wouldn’t make, now in my 20’s. I lowkey cringed listening to some of the old runs and wanted to do new ones, while keeping some of the old ones that I did like! https://t.co/LpVQHneCl2
it was a trip boo. Fr. in retrospect, it’s not healthy to have fame and success like that so early. and It was particularly hard for my mom. So much pressure, so many opinions and yes- men. no church in the wild. #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/I0OoADrB4f
to go to college after high school. But I wanted 2 move 2 LA &amp; make music. Tbvh 🤷‍♀️ I couldn’t have imagined I was gonna be in a legal dispute/ unable to release music/ fall into a deep depression because of it etc... (I def could’ve taken 4 years off while that was going on lol) https://t.co/pTljZlYvRy
Thank you baby. Did you like the lyric change from “im his 1 and only nothing less” to “that’s my name that’s tatted on his chest”? guy who wrote it (Balewa Muhammad) originally had the tattoo line but we had to change it cuz I was TWELVE. So this time around I used it 😘 https://t.co/CeFPMz7gAb
Recording Weak again was one of my FAVORITE sessions for this project!!!!!!! I LOVE that song and SWV soooooo much and I continued to be inspired by that song... its def informing my new music for next year... #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/iy1pGegfhu
actually everyone around me was supportive!!! they knew it would be healing for me personally and something that my fans really wanted. felt great to get this out before new music next year. no one can take my history away from me. I will always find a way. ♥️🥰 https://t.co/KGaqMssQeW

Man.... I love #NeverSayGoodbye soooooo much. It’s hard to say what my favorite is tho, u know? What’s yours? #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/QqSpxhakor
I love you too babe!!!! yes keeping the original essence was top priority since the albums are not available for streaming and ppl had been asking me about it every single day. Didn’t want to get too indulgent or experimental. It was abt giving my fans what they wanted. https://t.co/NoWsfATXG2
lol thank you babe! it’s been wild 4me listening my own (old/new) shit and appreciate it in a new way, in 2018. I actually relate to the lyrics now.  ps- I made the production &amp; mixes thump a lil harder cuz that’s the shit I like ;) #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/6nA7SZtsMF
Too Little Too Late and Leave (Get Out). They are my biggest songs and I wanted to give my fans the nostalgic feeling they loved, while staying true to my growth as a singer and young woman. #JoJoTheHighRoad https://t.co/avJ9j4fV3X
it’s 🤯🤯🤯 !!! Man I had no idea if people would understand why I was doing it... + if they would even like it. I cried when I saw the 2albums at #1 and #2 on iTunes. Seeing people able 2enjoy my entire catalogue of “official” music thru my career thus far makes me SO happy https://t.co/9a7oTGoXWd
oooooooh that’s harddddd.... I feel really connected to most of the songs... I wrote Keep on Keepin on by myself when I was 12 years old... recutting that had me in my feels... reconnecting to my younger self... taking her advice :) https://t.co/aKZ3XuQ62t
hey bae, those were songs that were officially released as singles by my former label, but were not available for streaming. Wanted to right that wrong. https://t.co/U32eVlITTy

When you are DEAD ASS WRONG, genuine soul searching, accountability, and REAL apologies are necessary.
