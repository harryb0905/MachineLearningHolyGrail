@Madgaffler It’s not funny at all that you would make any assumption about me in what I know on this subject. I’ve sat and cried with many soldiers men and women about the 22 veterans that commit suicide a day. I was trying to get a movie made concerning #22 to spread some enlightenment.
https://t.co/zCAvg4ln8j
@MeersBrooke Actually. If there is something I DO know. It is how depression and mental health work. Or I would’ve said nothing. Brooke.
@hercules215 The two people we know of who just committed suicide days apart from each other were rich and could do whatever they want. This effects everyone.
@pmarsh70 I know very personally, it is not simple at all.. it’s the deepest most complex thing in the world. The words.. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Are not simple words.
My heart is so heavy with sadness for the people losing their precious lives to suicide..you are not alone out there..Please know..You are not alone. Hold on to your life..Wake up today and look at the sky, look at animals, look at the things that make you smile..and breathe ♥️
