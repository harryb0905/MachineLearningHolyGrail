It’s simple. The President thinks you can just get credit at the grocery store. He doesn’t understand that most people are one paycheck from poverty. If he understood, he wouldn’t put our govt workforce at risk, or our airways. Now predatory lenders are targeting govt employees. https://t.co/RbrV2fD4EZ
Trump should have never shutdown the government in the 1st place. While we can now finally reopen government, this deal does not guarantee the job security of federal workers beyond the next 3 weeks. Trump must stop using the American people as a pawn and protect federal workers.
Trump must act to end the government shutdown. Millions of Americans are hurting. This madness needs to stop NOW.
Roger Stone has been indicted. Another person close to this president has been caught lying and breaking the law around the 2016 election.  It’s getting closer and closer to Trump’s circle. Who’s next? #ProtectMueller https://t.co/aMRDaxFEXA

Very inspiring to reflect on the legacy of Dr. King. He still inspires today to take action. Words aren’t enough. His legacy lives through OUR actions. https://t.co/l0DGV3kYRV
Today we celebrate the legacy #MLKJr. His example lives, &amp; is just as important in today’s climate as it was then.  It is important that we remember not just what he stood for, but for the courage of the man himself. Thank you, Dr. King &amp; all those who marched for a better world.
We need to turn the power of the Women’s March into laws that protect women. The only way to eliminate the gender pay gap &amp; other discriminations is to ratify the ERA. Without it, women’s equality is not guaranteed under the law &amp; not upheld in federal court.  It’s that simple.

I have a feeling this is just the beginning of the President’s lies beginning to unravel. Americans should demand the truth from their leaders, and Mr. Trump is no exception.   He doesn’t have the GOP covering for him in the House now. https://t.co/VUmjFn2wwg
Adding the #citizenshipquestion to the #2020census is nothing but the Trump Admin trying to take power away from immigrant-friendly states &amp; cities. They’re rigging the system because diversity isn’t part of the GOP platform.
Thanks for having me, @NPR. Like I said during the show, it’s time for Congress to act.  I’ll be reintroducing a bill prohibiting new #citizenshipquestion &amp; other major changes to the #2020census that haven’t been researched, studied &amp; tested for at least 3 yrs before the census. https://t.co/2kJ6aaogKj
#ClimateAction can’t wait any longer. Glaciers are melting. Sea levels are rising. Natural disasters are getting worse leaving people without water. It’s time to act for our planet #GreenNewDeal
You can count on me to ensure that every person in America is counted in the #2020census. The Constitution says this loud and clear and we won’t back down.
The #TrumpShutdown has caused a typical federal worker to miss about $5,000 in pay – causing hardship for 100s of 1000s of families. The President says he feels their pain. RT if you think he should show it by closing his hotels &amp; resorts until it's over. https://t.co/s2qYlG3xSS
“If that data is manipulated by deliberately undercounting specific communities, then our system of representative democracy is undermined.”  Our very democracy is at stake &amp; it is very underreported. My op-ed: https://t.co/73u7DqJo1I
I don’t care if the President serves McDonalds &amp; Wendy’s at the WH, but I do care about government workers having to take out loans &amp; predatory payday advances to survive while they are still forced to work. #ForThePeople  #TrumpShutdown
This is a huge victory for our democracy.  I fought hard to remove the citizenship question from the #2020census.  Congress must continue to act to keep the citizenship question out of the #2020Census, &amp; I intend to do everything I can to see that we do https://t.co/CnFbtFHpbp

If Trump really wants to protect families he would #EndTheShutdown &amp; get behind common sense gun reform and opioid addiction legislation.  He doesn’t care. He’s corrupt &amp; playing politics with our lives. This speech isn’t about a wall to keep people out, it’s a wall to divide us.
This is what happens when you have a president who makes world-shaking decisions with his gut, ignoring the experts and his own staff. Major policies shouldn't be decided on a hunch. In the case of this president a coin flip might be better. #TrumpTradeWar https://t.co/u3Ntgcry5e

Over 800,000 federal workers are furloughed or working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown, including 14,000 New Yorkers. I’ve pledged to donate my salary to food banks in NY-12, for as long as Trump plans to keep the government closed. https://t.co/qmH2eKCdn0
Our constituents are speaking loud and clear.  Nobody is willing to trade in a wall to go to work (without pay) or be forced to stay home while not being able to provide for the families.  This isn’t normal, or responsible on any level. https://t.co/ndQXGOATrx

Our nation's “record” on #studentloans is shameful. A college education should be a ticket to success, not a crippling financial burden. That’s why I’ve cosponsored legislation to help reduce student debt. It should be a high priority for the new Congress. https://t.co/x4OoSEJ25y
Had a great time at the Gramercy Stuyvesant Independent Democrats club holiday party with @harveyforNY and @CarlinaRivera https://t.co/l5HLacBIJM
.@realDonaldTrump tells us everything that he touches is the “best,” “greatest” and “record-breaking” – but the only record he is breaking is for the biggest deficit on record. Unfortunately, he is running the country the way he ran his casinos. https://t.co/afZ8G8l3Ib @bpolitics
It’s been 6 years since Sandy Hook &amp; we’ve done next to nothing at the federal level to address gun violence.  I am hopeful that in 2019 we can finally intact legislation that will save lives. Our progress so far is unacceptable.
Despite overwhelming evidence that our planet is warming and it will cause catastrophic damage, the oil industry pushes for policies that would INCREASE greenhouse gas emissions. Its narrow self-interest trumps concern for all humankind. #ClimateChange https://t.co/1V0EFOwKb5

Congratulations to @LizKrueger for winning us the majority in the state senate. She will be chairing the senate finance committee. Congratulations to Liz!
Thanks to the @nytimes and its @nytclimate reporters for their extensive, insightful reporting on #ClimateChange. These stories paint a chilling picture of what is happening to our planet. This is must reading. https://t.co/GvIZ2yTCff
In NC, GOP candidate Mark Harris hired a known criminal and dirty-trickster as a campaign operative. The man ran a scam to block absentee ballots of voters likely to vote for Democrat Dan @McCreadyforNC.    What did Harris know – and when did he know it? https://t.co/DZjDiM4jdp
Thank you to the Financial District Lions Club for selecting me as an honoree! They do outstanding work connecting business leaders with members of the community and promoting local philanthropy and I applaud their efforts. https://t.co/zj12S1UjVh

We must ensure that the Mueller investigation continues without interference and pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act. RT if you agree this is a national necessity! It matters.  https://t.co/MOj1Z8i5ZB
If Republicans really want to help the economy, they should stop denying the obvious – that human activity is warming the planet, that the results will be catastrophic, that it’s happening quickly and that we must do something about it NOW. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/mQ9iRSrB4q
@RBReich The President is reckless and swung at China, but instead hit Americans who count on him.
Proud to stand with the men and women of @IBEWLocal3 in their fight for fair wages and benefits. Labor unions built this country and I will always have their backs. #UnionStrong #SpectrumStrike https://t.co/xxQJ1rDySD
Consider this: More Americans have been killed by gun violence since 1968 than all U.S. wars. I’m introducing legislation to not only allow research on gun violence, but directly fund it. Understanding data is one of our most important tools to save lives. https://t.co/XjMSsLqaDS
Proud to support @MelindaKatz for District Attorney! She is a fearless leader and a proud daughter of #Queens. Her strong legal background makes her an excellent candidate and I am confident she will  continue to serve Queens well. https://t.co/oAUKRUisBI
SNAP puts food on the table for the working poor &amp; will lead to less reliance on public assistance overall. This isn’t politics, it’s essential for a fair &amp; strong economy. SNAP benefits help those families who work hard and need assistance.  https://t.co/XZYYP3EU1y
Did you know that women currently do not have full, equal rights under the law?  Ratifying the ERA is long past due.  Women must have full legal defense against discrimination under the rule of law.  We are one state away #ERAnow  https://t.co/HkyxKPsG78
Hey, NY! Healthcare open enrollment is happening right NOW. You can look for, compare, and sign up for plans at https://t.co/HUMD0nRMa6. Many NYers are also eligible for assistance - the only way to know is to start the process. #GetCovered!
The #EITC is one of our effective anti-poverty programs. It rewards hard work by partially matching earned income up to a certain threshold, helping millions of people in the process. It should be expanded.  I support @RoKhanna's GAIN Act to do just that.  https://t.co/oHDzZinGoE
A comprehensive calculation of the #GenderPayGap suggests it may be greater than 50¢ per dollar. Watch this insightful interview by @CBSNews based on research by economist @HeidiatIWPR. Let’s close the gap with affordable childcare and paid family leave. https://t.co/M1gNHcgkmh

A study by the @FederalReserve finds that almost half (46%) of Americans don’t have enough money for an unexpected $400 expense.  This is a tragedy. Our #economy is not yet working for everyone. We need to do more.  https://t.co/beDGvW9Rgt
The #GenderPayGap may bigger than we thought. @HeidiatIWPR of @IWPResearch finds women overall may be paid less than 50¢ for every $1 earned by men. This partly is caused by the lack of paid family leave &amp; affordable childcare. Time to change that!  https://t.co/fg4Xr9JQgB

Republicans talk about slashing regulations as if they serve no purpose. But fair rules are essential to protect us from those who would do harm for their own profit. Polluters inflict damage on health, environment &amp; the economy. We must fight them.  https://t.co/vx0zvGn7fA
This weekend, we lost a #HERstory maker. Dr. Olivia Hooker was the first African-American woman to serve in the @USCG.

The National Climate Assessment makes it abundantly clear that we must act on #climatechange NOW, or people will die.  Climate change is already hurting Americans, our health and our economy. If we don't act, the damage we are causing will be irreversible. https://t.co/siJJ5wVp4T
Today, the Tuesday after #Thanksgiving, is #GivingTuesday. It's a time for us, after celebrating what we are most grateful for, to reflect on how we can give back. I encourage everyone to give what you can to the causes that mean the most to you. Every $ makes a difference.
The Republican Congress hasn’t done nearly enough to contain the high cost of prescription drugs. The new Democratic majority in the House will investigate why #DrugPrices are so high &amp; will work to do something about it. This is a priority - count me in. https://t.co/CywcVrcQRz
Great info for any dinner debates tonight. #HappyThanksgiving  https://t.co/kRwhuuFc80
Happy Thanksgiving! I wish everyone a happy and meaningful holiday. We have much to be thankful for. Today, I'm especially grateful to all of the women and men in uniform who are away from their families, serving our nation. We are forever in your debt. Come home safe.
Last Fri. Betsy DeVos proposed gutting protections for campus sexual assault survivors. She actually wants to make it easier for someone to get away with rape. When Ds take the House in Jan., I’ll fight to block this horrific idea. #HandsOffIX   https://t.co/mXFudl1Ln1
The #MinimumWage was never enough to really support a family, but with inflation it’s worth even less than it was 50 years ago. It’s time to #RaiseTheWage. https://t.co/2uoC9osYcL
Over almost 40 years, the income of top CEOs has increased by over 1,000%, while the pay of average workers has increased by only 11%. How do Republicans respond? They pass tax cuts for the rich and blame the poor. #GOPTaxScam

The good news about the #economy continues a trend that began under @BarackObama. In the last 2 yrs of the #Obama admin, an avg of 211K jobs were created each month. In the 1st (almost) 2 yrs of the #Trump admin, an avg of 196K were added. #ThanksObama ! https://t.co/MgEWhj8M37
Many of the jobs created during the early months of the Trump administration were due to policies set in place by @BarackObama and to thriving US businesses. Donald #Trump inherited a strong #economy, which likely would have gotten stronger whether or not he was elected. https://t.co/qEzqPSCqQj

Earlier this week (Halloween, like my outfit?), I was proud to support @Nate_McMurray &amp; his campaign for #NY27. He's a great candidate &amp; will be an outstanding representative.

At a remembrance service this weekend, Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor, shared his memories of Kristallnacht &amp; the terror he felt watching hate take over &amp; police stand by. He contrasted that with the way NYPD stepped up this weekend to protect temples across the city
Important thread:  I don’t recognize America. This rise in hate and anti-semitism cannot be ignored. Violence can’t be tolerated. And words matter.
In Heidi’s honor, buy a commemorative coin for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Part of the cost of the coin is donated to the Foundation. (Or buy directly from https://t.co/khVHSjjjo5
Not only is @HeidiHeitkamp brave, but while she is running for re-election she is STILL fighting for women by fighting against breast cancer. She is an incredibly capable and devoted public servant and she deserves another term. Will you help her? https://t.co/43W81QBbjY
The more you normalize hate speech, the more likely someone will take an action like sending a bomb.   When you call the media "the ENEMY of the people", laud violence against reporters, lead chants of “lock her up,” you make an attack more likely.

It’s very simple: If you were the head of a company and were interviewing a candidate for a very important, lifelong position, would you refuse to listen to character references?   Does that sound like a responsible business decision? #Kavanaugh https://t.co/fVvaetoIM1
Senators should think about how history will judge them. There is plenty of evidence that #Kavanaugh is unfit for #SCOTUS. Law school profs say so. Churches say so. You can’t say you didn’t know. Google and Wikipedia will remember. #DoTheRightThing

Those of us in the room could feel Dr. Ford's pain as she spoke. I'm in awe of her courage.

@realDonaldTrump This is rich coming from someone who has had 16 women (that we know of so far) with the strength and courage to come forward with their stories of abuse. #BelieveWomen
Because apparently two sexual misconduct allegations aren't enough. https://t.co/qWFXpnXjoq
This is a sworn declaration from a woman whose background includes national security clearances saying that Judge #Kavanaugh participated in physically abusive behavior including gang raping women, including herself. #CancelTheVote and have a full investigation. #BelieveWomen https://t.co/2I9230cR1K
#GOP Republicans hire an experienced female sex-crimes prosecutor to do what they say they’re not qualified to do, then @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell calls her an “assistant.” Tone deaf. He has no idea that what he is saying is insulting. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/AyJKSeybit

The #Kavanaugh hearings are not a trial, they are a job interview and we are the employer  In light of the serious allegations by #DrChristineFord  We must see ALL of his records Not just the ones calculated to make him look good  #ReleaseTheRecords #KavanaughConfirmationHearing

The lack of transparency in Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings is a disservice to the American people! When Justice Kagan was nominated by President Obama, 99% of her records were released &amp; put into a online database. Let’s hold #Kavanaugh to that same standard. RT if you agree!

Let this sink in. Nearly 1/2 of U.S. women are sexually harassed when they enter the workforce.  The fast-food industry is often the 1st job that young women may have. 42% report being harassed.

Still reeling from the shock of losing so many outstanding @nydailynews reporters and editors. I'll never forget the paper's Pulitzer-winning coverage of 9/11 related illnesses that led to the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.  https://t.co/ElXEcCX6LV
The US is way behind Europe when it comes to getting more women on corporate boards. Yet my bill requiring public companies to simply divulge the gender composition of their boards is being blocked by the House GOP. Ridiculous. We must keep fighting. https://t.co/41psEd2Ska
It was very moving to see the mementos — rocks, flowers, pine cones, and more — left by admirers at Harriet Tubman’s grave. https://t.co/jLyc8RRgEU
Proud to cochair the Faith &amp; Politics Institute’s First ever pilgrimage to Seneca Falls and Western New York on the 170th anniversary of the world’s first woman’s rights convention.  #ERA #womensrights #senecafalls #womensmusem https://t.co/RTSAyPuSr5
Proud to join @FaithNPolitics and @RepTomReed this weekend on a sojourn to the birthplace of Women's Rights. Exactly 170 years ago a group of women gathered for the 1st time to speak out against the oppression of half the population. Remembering their passion renews ours #ERANow
Yesterday was a sad day for our country. Thank you to @JohnBrennan and everyone else who has condemned the President's absolutely outrageous and disastrous press conference. We cannot let this go. #ProtectOurDemocracy #ProtectMueller  https://t.co/KOwsgz89Eb
Let me be clear: In all my years as a public servant and member of congress, I have never seen anything as blatantly treasonous as Donald Trump’s performance this morning... he reached a new low for himself. What will McConnell and Ryan say?
On a hot day like today it's so nice to get out onto one of NYC's waterways. Thanks @NorthBKBoatClub for organizing today's public paddle and getting us out onto #Newtown Creek! https://t.co/3xki9eGGHv
Excited to be participating in the first ever @NYCParks #OpenGardenDayNYC! Getting my hands dirty in the garden is one of my favorite hobbies. Community gardens are such an important part of our city and are tool for people to come together and learn about the environment. https://t.co/SGcPAuGba9
Thank you to the voters for honoring me with the Democratic nomination for #NY12. I will continue doing all I can to fight back against Trump’s hateful agenda and make sure we take back the House in November!
Less than three hours til polls close! RT if you voted, #ny12! There's still time if you haven't – and make sure your friends did, too. polls are open until 9 - confirm your location here: https://t.co/KltusgUq9Q

Happy #PrimaryDay. Let’s bring one home for #ny12 today – and keep fighting to deliver results for our city. Polls are open from 6am to 9pm – confirm your polling location and make your plan to vote: https://t.co/sjlDgS7BK3 https://t.co/BOg6dbDiXq

I need your help tomorrow – and this is the last time I can ask: volunteer with us to make sure every single supporter gets out to the polls tomorrow and casts their ballots. Can I count on you? Let me know: https://t.co/lK2qkcwAiw
New Yorkers have always led the way when it comes to women's rights. Tomorrow, I hope you will vote for this New Yorker so I can keep leading the effort to protect #WomensHealth, combat sexual harassment and to fight for #ERAnow. #ny12 https://t.co/pqoTHH82hr
We owe our 9/11 first responders a great deal. The #Zadroga Act has given them the care and security they need. In Congress, you can count on me to defend against the Trump administration’s shameful efforts to take that security away. That’s why you need to vote tomorrow. #ny12 https://t.co/T5W2qax3SC
.@DickGottfried is making #GOTV calls to help people make their plans to vote in #ny12 tomorrow – thanks, Assembly Member! You can join him tonight or tomorrow by signing up here: https://t.co/lK2qkcwAiw #TeamMaloney https://t.co/i6Wcd0jt1s
This job is about getting results for #ny12. I'm proud of the $10 bil. I've secured for subways, tunnels &amp; bridges; it's been used to build the 2nd Ave Subway and replace the Kosciuszko Bridge. Tmrw, I hope you'll vote so I can keep bringing home the resources our city needs. https://t.co/i2JozYoB2q
If you live in #ny12, get out and vote tomorrow to send a message that we're not going to stand for assaults on women's rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, civil rights. @realDonaldTrump is trying to turn back the clock– but your vote tomorrow shows you won’t let that happen.
Out talking to voters in Williamsburg right now reminding them to #Vote in tomorrow’s primary! #ny12 #CarolynOnYourCorner https://t.co/BQgp5hSRLk
I’ve spent my career fighting for quality health care – I #StandwithPP every day, have fought to improve access to birth control, defended #ACA, &amp; championed Medicare for All. @realdonaldtrump wants to tear that care away, but your vote tmrw shows you won’t let that happen. #ny12
Tomorrow is #ElectionDay in NY. Get out and vote so we can keep fighting to fix our subways, pass Medicare for All, and stand up to a White House hell bent on destroying values that made the US the envy of the world.

“No one knows just how many perpetrators of sexual violence have been identified through DNA evidence thanks to Carolyn Maloney and her support of the funding the Debbie Smith Act provides. We’re lucky to have Carolyn in Congress.” Thanks, @GloriaSteinem. https://t.co/NqKJX3jEGe
This job is about helping people and making a difference in the lives of New Yorkers.   That’s why I’ve worked to bring federal $ for the 2nd Ave Subway, the Kosciuszko Bridge, and more.

This proves the unconstitutional #CitizenshipQuestion was absolutely premeditated and political. I'm fighting to protect the #2020census and ensure that EVERYONE gets counted. RT if you agree. https://t.co/JWxxoiocNG
Between the Office of Refugee Resettlement and the CFPB, Trump’s really on a roll when it comes to actively undermining critical government agencies. This time, it’s literally ripping families apart. Where does it end? https://t.co/99g2RyNi2A
This kind of compassion and determination – this is what America looks like. Not @realdonaldtrump’s cruel and inhumane policies. Thanks John Lewis, as always, for demonstrating what REAL courage looks like. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/aF6aCGKyQc
Thanks, @JessLappin for your support. Excited to keep working with you to help #ny12 thrive - vote June 26 if you’re with me and Jessica! https://t.co/SMidoKSkIu
First line says it all: the CFPB “has all but closed its doors” with @MickMulvaneyOMB in charge. Kraninger’s nomination is just a blatantly political move to keep Mulvaney in power. RT if you’re voting this June 26 to #DefendtheCFPB. https://t.co/cb8zkudwR6
It’s nearly time – the most important weekend for our campaign. Sign up for a #GOTV shift in the final four days before the June 26 #ny12 primary! Our success depends on you – let us know we can count on your help: https://t.co/9yI5ruaphH

I'm so proud to have @LIDBrooklyn's support. The work you do for the LGBTQ equality and for our community is incredible. Thank you for everything! https://t.co/yYmEDe4NHv
#ny12 needs a fighter that will help make #ERAnow a reality – and that’s what I’ve done every moment of my career serving you. We have a moment where we can finally achieve equal rights – and that time is now. https://t.co/VsPlGQNiCo
.@HRC is an inspiration in the fight for equal rights – this #PrideMonth, I’m proud to have your support in the June 26 #ny12 primary. I’ll never stop fighting until #LGBTQ people are #EqualEverywhere. https://t.co/C8L19LpLzU
This nightmare is because of @realdonaldTrump. They aren’t “signing something” because they want to, but because their actions have been called out so loudly by so many.  We need the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to ensure this cruelty NEVER happens again. https://t.co/HA8V7ug08d
Thanks @LCVoters for your support – proud to stand with you in the fight to #BootPruitt and #resist the destructive environmental policies of the Trump administration. Honored to have your endorsement in the #ny12 primary June 26. https://t.co/59qLgTzk4s
Yet another way the Trump admin has found to penalize Americans with pre-existing conditions. Astonishing that we would let our nation’s most vulnerable suffer from poor care at higher prices while touting it as a panacea for high costs. Do better. https://t.co/wmwaZV1kgy
Absolutely! https://t.co/TeYGycOJos
ONE WEEK until the #ny12 primary – make your plan to vote now! Check your polling location here: https://t.co/01qYwGIjBr
This is as gross as it gets - Trump aides plan to gloat about tearing away kids from their parents to boost their political chances. This policy is an atrocity. It's on all of us to show that we won't stand for it. #FamiliesBelongTogether #FlipTheHouse https://t.co/WxZBbfdW0I
Immigrants are HUMAN BEINGS, @realDonaldTrump, PEOPLE looking for a better life. Words matter and you're using language that hearkens back to some of the darkest times in human history. We will stop you. #FamiliesBelongTogether #FlipTheHouse https://t.co/LZ1iLqok6X
New CFPB nominee is more political posturing to make sure @MickMulvaneyOMB can keep destroying the agency from the inside and ruining consumers’ lives. Americans need a real advocate for #ConsumerProtection on their side – not more sabotage at the CFPB. https://t.co/ENEzVkxSkM
.@realdonaldtrump's heartless and morally bankrupt practice of separating children from families has GOT to end. Proud to stand with colleagues yesterday to demand a stop to this. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/SFPr7HqgAK
#Infrastructure investments bring huge economic impact to NYC – they create jobs, &amp; make it easier to get around our city. I’m proud to have secured $10b for projects right here at home – and you can count on me to keep fighting for them. #ny12 https://t.co/bwRX466ynb
This was a heartbreaking experience but it is so much worse for the fathers we met who had their children taken away from them. No one deserves this. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/yE0sncVy3Q
Beautiful day to celebrate Roosevelt Island Day - come say hi, and make sure you’re ready to vote in 10 days! #ny12 https://t.co/3jJzurEUFI
Outrageous. 2,000 children ripped away from their families – in some cases right from their parents’ arms. This is inhumane, cruel and un-American. I'm fighting to end this atrocity.  https://t.co/KGwUKZSav1
Thanks, @CoreyinNYC! I’m excited to keep working with you to improve our infrastructure, fight for women’s and LGBTQ rights, and more. Thrilled to have your support in the #ny12 primary June 26. https://t.co/Kng8AsbNkx
Preposterous that some think pre-existing conditions are somehow a result of not taking care of yourself. It’s insulting to patients everywhere – and it leads to policy that lets insurance cos do what they do best: take advantage of the little guy. We have to uphold #ACA. https://t.co/3HLUPAifpY
Thanks to @Bradybuzz for your endorsement – proud to stand with you as an advocate for commonsense #GunControl policies to protect our children. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/4beuuvN2Vm
That's right. The Equal Rights Amendment is " still necessary today, as equality for women in the United States is not enshrined in the Constitution" and I won't stop fighting until it is ratified. #ERAnow. https://t.co/tGfcYoyQpK
So not only is the #2020census citizenship question blatantly political, it was a costly addition – which @SecretaryRoss has not been transparent about. RT if you agree the admin needs to stop spending taxpayer $ to rig the census for their own gain. https://t.co/oj3H2r4dSB
When you attack the press, you attack democracy. A free press is necessary for freedom. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop talking up dictators and tearing down democratic institutions. https://t.co/PWs5LqDbIz
.@realdonaldtrump says he’s proud of America, but with decisions like the new asylum guidance I can’t fathom why. He and Jeff Sessions are seizing on spineless @GOP inaction on #immigration and making a mockery of US moral leadership. Stop. https://t.co/s8IbK80wls
The time is now – we have to seize this moment to push forward a movement I’ve led for decades: to finally make equal rights a constitutional reality. RT if you’re with me and @Alyssa_Milano in the fight for #ERAnow. https://t.co/0Pj5L1EURi
Thank you Richie for your service and kind words. Working with you and the entire 9/11 community to pass the #ZadrogaAct and provide healthcare to sick and injured 9/11 first responders &amp; survivors has been the proudest moment of my time in public service #NeverForget #ny12 https://t.co/xGmgK612Ex
.@realdonaldtrump’s cruel efforts to gut the #ACA and allow insurers to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions will cost lives. We need to stand against it by MAKING it an issue this fall so we can #FlipTheHouse &amp; #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/N2VBKvFm2j
This is just the latest in a long string of voting rights attacks from SCOTUS - and unfortunately it lines right up with what the @GOP wants - that's why we have to fight voter suppression in all its forms.  https://t.co/uPtew5U4fy
I wrote the CARD Act because too many people were getting ripped off by abusive &amp; unfair credit card penalties. And it’s working. Just ask Molly, who’s one of the millions of consumers saving over $12b/yr. Vote June 26 to help me keep fighting &amp; delivering for consumers. #ny12 https://t.co/rMGDxAnn4X
Proud to stand with @ReElectNydia and @SenGillibrand to condemn @realdonaldtrump’s disastrous response to the devastation in #PuertoRico at the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade. https://t.co/Jljo2nxIqw

Gun violence is one of the largest threats to our kids – but @GOP is failing to act &amp; @BetsyDeVosED and her know-nothing colleagues think it’s not worth discussing for school safety. Talk about wrongheaded – kudos to my Dem colleagues for calling her out. https://t.co/USgKr7W6l7
Here’s the thing, Mr Attorney General – SCOTUS has ruled on the #ACA. Multiple times. It’s the law of the land. Your ignominious efforts to sabotage it are more of the same: maneuvering to score cheap points, while risking millions of lives. #BeBetter https://t.co/5aLLO8jBdO
We need to send a msg to @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr that this “crackdown” is inhumane and we won’t stand for it. We are called the greatest nation, but we are only as good as how we treat our most vulnerable. GOP leadership is failing. https://t.co/P3scNQdfG0
People ask me why I run. The answer is simple. I run for people like @morethanmySLE because I believe health care should be a right in this country, not a privilege. Watch Peter's story below to learn why I'm all in to protect the #ACA and fight for #MedicareForAll. #ny12 https://t.co/G33iZwJgbX
First not meeting with the board – now disbanding it. This isn't the "protection" @ElizabethforMA and I had in mind for after the financial crash. This is a crisis for consumers and a tragedy for America. We need to #FlipTheHouse &amp; #DefendtheCFPB https://t.co/aVOHiGzYDA
In awe of @Alyssa_Milano’s dedication to this cause. With her help, we’re going to make #ERAnow a reality – to make sure once and for all that women’s rights aren’t dependent on political whims. https://t.co/DSAxphVdKV
ICYMI from the @QueensGazette endorsement: “Maloney is one of the best Congress members in the entire country and we are proud to call her Representative. She deserves to win big as a show of support for her hard work and dedication to our community.” https://t.co/lBBosPEtU3
Joined @Alyssa_Milano on @mitchellreports #AMR today to talk about #ERAnow and #metoo. “Individual laws can be rolled back… women’s rights shouldn’t be dependent on the whim of who’s in the White House or who’s on the Supreme Court or who is the Speaker of the House.” https://t.co/sva3NowuEe
The @washingtonpost editorial board is exactly right – healthcare is broken and Republicans are the ones breaking it. That’s why I’ve consistently defended the #ACA and supported even further steps towards universal healthcare – namely, #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/kHQAiRKqcI
Can’t say I’m surprised. As long as @MickMulvaneyOMB is in charge at the CFPB, consumers will be consistently shut out in favor of policies that could lead to another financial crisis. That’s the game he plays with voters’ livelihoods - it's unacceptable. https://t.co/MzayeXEfqA
Who agrees that it’s long since due for women to have an equal rights amendment? Sign my petition and let’s get this done. This matters. https://t.co/2IQisPMH4m
Great time celebrating #PrideMonth with the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club last night - a strong leader for LGBTQ issues in NYC. And always good to see Tony Hoffman, @allenroskoff, and @tomdinapoli! https://t.co/2YUnW9UWOq
Proud to stand with @Alyssa_Milano today in NYC to demand #ERAnow – take a look: “We need to act so that women’s progress and women’s equality can not be threatened by every shift of the political winds… These should be bedrock protections in our constitution.” https://t.co/RFZDXPiIa1
I'm extremely disappointed with this SCOTUS decision. We cannot be a country that discriminates based on how we identify. Congress needs to pass the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ people all across the country  #LoveIsLove https://t.co/whHTW0vNwd
Today, @Alyssa_Milano &amp; I begin to work to make this a reality. Sign my petition &amp; let's turn a movement into the #RightSideOfHistory https://t.co/2IQisPMH4m
In the time of #MeToo &amp; #TimesUp it’s telling that something major is missing from the women’s movement. There’s no Equal Rights Amendment - #ERANow. 1/2
So grateful for this awesome team! https://t.co/3b2DjzrzjK

Latest evidence that the Trump admin continues to ignore perils of #ClimateChange and refuses all mitigation efforts. While #ParisAgreement would have allowed us to have these conversations on a global level, @realdonaldtrump buries his head in the sand. https://t.co/eS7BodH5ZD
ICYMI: Me on the ERA in this @CNN piece: "As we see attacks on women's rights, autonomy, and bodies every single day from the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress, passing the ERA is our strongest weapon to fight back." #ERANow https://t.co/oykxAJSldm
Good – and I proudly stand with them. We can’t keep letting this administration rip away critical protections for #WomensHealth. I #StandwithPP #ERAnow https://t.co/t4Vkg36mct

Whenever and wherever policies are being made about contraception &amp; reproductive health care - there must be women at the table.  And there is only one thing that can make that happen: You.  #Persist #RegisterToVote #GetInspired #GetInvolved   3/3  https://t.co/aeACOUqN7Y
And... the higher than expected #BlueWave among Democratic Voters was "magnified" amongst women in college educated precincts. 2/3 https://t.co/DVkdTWyNfs
It’s no secret that the Trump regime attacks women’s health care rights. Now SCOTUS puts us in the crosshairs.   Warning to @realDonaldTrump - this primary season has been defined by women who won in 45/65 races where they faced a male non-incumbent. 1/3 https://t.co/tHyasuXKhe
More attacks on women’s health yesterday from SCOTUS. We need to guarantee women’s equality once and for all – that’s why I’ll keep fighting for #ERAnow. https://t.co/FmGujATbl8

No wonder @realDonaldTrump wants to shut down the Mueller investigation before he has to testify. R's need to allow a vote to protect the Special Counsel. This is bigger than party. It's about the rule of law and institutions fundamental to our democracy. https://t.co/o3Xn9fK8Kj

Totally unacceptable that @realdonaldtrump’s lead on drug pricing is a fmr lobbyist for the drug industry – but, sadly, totally predictable. It’s b/c of exactly this shady behavior that we need to #FlipTheHouse to implement fair #DrugPricing for Americans. https://t.co/swgXrR3lqH
.@MickMulvaneyOMB needs to be ousted from @CFPB as fast as humanly possible. He is single-handedly ruining essential #ConsumerProtection rules we put in place to protect Americans from another financial crisis. Apparently he just doesn’t care. https://t.co/IbbHOoSUHU
Ripping away children from their families is cruel, inhumane, and needs to stop immediately. I've called for immediate Oversight Committee hearings. What is happening is unacceptable and we all have an obligation to stand against it. https://t.co/FtSsZW9l9Y
On this #MemorialDay, we remember the sacrifices made by the brave individuals who have defended the freedoms and privileges of our nation. May we use this moment to reflect and recommit ourselves to upholding those same values for all Americans.
@wsidemike I voted no. Here's the clarification from Public Citizen: https://t.co/3kk9ptFMaz
I don’t care how you feel about the #immigration debate – this is inhumane and it must end. This is not the America I know. https://t.co/lhh5NUKFpw

ICYMI @ReElectNydia &amp; I held a town hall in Brooklyn to demand action to #EndGunViolence. Shameful that @SpeakerRyan &amp; his @GOP minions cower to the #NRA instead of acting to save lives. #VOTE in the #ny12 primary 6/26 to make sure we hold them accountable https://t.co/tzgOcQiWDR
@NYCMandAhole @SenateMajLdr @GOP Hi, I voted against the rollback. Here's the clarification from Public Citizen:   https://t.co/3kk9ptFMaz
@j_lupella @elizabethforma Hi, I voted no. Here's the clarification from Public Citizen: https://t.co/3kk9ptFMaz
It’s not just tech – women are underrepresented in every industry, and their heroic work goes unrecognized. It’s time for that to change, but @realdonaldtrump’s war on women isn’t helping. We need #ERAnow to enshrine women’s equality in the Constitution. https://t.co/Ry3ZCNRPZH
After 2008, I helped put rules in place that help prevent a crash. But yesterday Congress passed the #DoddFrankRollBack, effectively letting banks off the leash. Esp on this issue, I’m proud to stand side by side with @elizabethforma – a tenacious #ConsumerProtection warrior. https://t.co/NOjnPeZB4q
Excited to have the support of @Local46ML, @smartunionworks, @steelworkers, and @BldgTrdsUnions in the #ny12 primary on June 26! With labor rights under assault, it’s more important than ever that NYC stand #UnionStrong. I always will. https://t.co/sIOwN3UPah
No serious voting rights expert has called for citizenship data to be included on the #2020census – that’s why we need answers from the admin when they make these claims to cover for a blatantly political move. My IDEA Act would ensure #EveryoneCounts. https://t.co/zInQtJiLml
@Clownboys_wife I voted no on the rollback. Here's the clarification from Public Citizen https://t.co/3kk9ptFMaz
@blankmw I voted no. Here's the clarification from Public Citizen: https://t.co/3kk9ptFMaz
I voted against the #DoddFrank repeal bill passed by the House yesterday bc I believe we should put #consumersfirst, not big banks. Rolling back the protections we put in place to prevent another #GreatRecession is just bad legislating.
Thanks @CarlinaRivera for your kind words and support. Carlina knows what it means to fight – that’s why the East Side is lucky to have her as their voice on the City Council, and I’m lucky to have her on my side in the #ny12 primary June 26! https://t.co/zZFx7rgREs
For far too long, we’ve kept the shackles on the one agency actually capable of producing some meaningful answers about #GunViolence – it’s time to let @CDCgov do its job and investigate an epidemic that’s killing our children. #EndGunViolenceNOW https://t.co/k1JqmzUP81 https://t.co/erpW5iugu3
It’s no secret @realdonaldtrump has a history of disrespecting women but that's just fueling our fire. Women have shown time &amp; again this year that we will not stand silent in the face of bigotry &amp; misogyny. We're going to #FlipTheHouse #YearOfTheWoman 6/6
It takes a special type of hypocrite to call yourself pro-life, claim to care about children and then turn your back on parents who want their children to have access to food, clean air &amp; water, and adequately funded public schools. We see your hypocrisy, and it’s tired. 5/
34% of what @PPFA does is provide contraception. For a party that's vehemently anti-choice &amp; tells women to "be smarter" &amp; not get pregnant, this is the ultimate slap in the face. @WhiteHouse is telling women they have no choices, that their bodies are just for making babies. 4/
.@VP may actually understand facts &amp; figures, so here's something to think about: In IN, STI #'s skyrocketed when he withdrew funding from @PPFA. This admin isn't only waging war on women, but anyone who is different - especially those in poverty &amp; it’s absolutely disgusting. 3/
42% of what @PPFA does is STI testing &amp; treatment. Now, I can understand the confusion for @realdonaldtrump when allegedly he doesn’t know the difference between HPV &amp; HIV. We know that facts &amp; figures go over his head. 2/
In all my years fighting for repro health, this is one of the most idiotic attacks I've seen. Women have the RIGHT to choose &amp; to counsel that helps them make informed choices. @PPFA clinics are community pillars that serve ppl all across this country. 1/ https://t.co/GidjsPkmVR
This ruling is one the biggest blows to workers' rights in history. It bars 10+ mil workers from banding together over terms of employment, making it harder to combat sexual harassment, pay discrimination, workplace safety violations &amp; more. #Disgusting   https://t.co/XK8LEvOVoQ
.@davidhogg111's bravery and perseverance are awe-inspiring. I'm proud to stand with him and students across the country for #GunControlNow. It's way past time for our country to realize #EnoughIsEnough. https://t.co/145Po11YJA
Beautiful weather for the the Ukrainian Street Festival at St George’s Church today! Had fun connecting with #ny12 voters and reminding them to #VOTE on June 26! https://t.co/kC6o58kWSb
Congrats to my friend @HarveyforNY on his inauguration into the State Assembly today. He’s been an outstanding leader on fair housing for NYC and is exactly what we need in Albany now. Looking forward to working with him to make #ny12 a better place for families to live and work. https://t.co/akVQjs4GvY
Thanks to @NYWFP, the progressive backbone of New York, for your endorsement. I'm proud to have your support in the June 26 #ny12 primary. https://t.co/QbdT92cFtx
It’s beyond devastating that it’s too late to save the thousands of students' lives shattered by gun violence.  @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr have offered prayers for each of these tragedies. But they haven’t  considered legislation to prevent the next.  https://t.co/i73xfVXDi6
Another school shooting, another day with stories of carnage and horror. Families will bury children, &amp; hearts are shattered forever.   I’ve sponsored 7 gun bills, let’s ask @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr why they are holding up solutions to this epidemic. https://t.co/RwVnHrnKWu
Confirmation of what we already knew – the Trump Admin is trying to add a #CitizenshipQuestion to rig the #2020census for purely partisan gain. That’s why we NEED to pass my #2020Census IDEA Act to make sure EVERYONE is counted. https://t.co/yD6WrBFFwC
I'm going to say something shocking: I agree w/ @senatemajldr - the @GOP Senate majority is in play. This is what happens when you fail on every measurable level to help ppl. It takes a special type of arrogance to hurt ppl &amp; expect them to vote for you. https://t.co/8zeQlG5gKO
Oh, big surprise – ppl wheeling and dealing their support on one bad bill in exchange for passage of a different, worse one. The @GOP #FarmBill is as disastrous as the bigoted efforts to shut our borders. You know what would help? A #BlueWave2018. #Resist https://t.co/cCrDqpCcwT
#DREAMers have known no other home than the US, but the Trump admin is spending huge amounts of time and $ defending its coldhearted and morally repugnant decision to rip apart thousands of families. We need to #FlipTheHouse in 2018 to #DefendDACA.  https://t.co/uMhC7zQMKz
Last night the PA elections showed us again why 2018 is going to the year of the woman. Change is coming. #BlueWave  https://t.co/YJlvsCO9Aq
We’re facing more cyber threats  than ever before – and very real attacks on democracy. But @realdonaldtrump thinks it’s ok to eliminate a central coordinator for these issues. That’s crazy - and makes us look out of touch with the threats we face. https://t.co/APaSTz3Dcq
I just wrote @SecAzar asking about his plans to use @CDCgov's increased budget to research gun violence. He's been awfully silent since claiming he wanted to do this back in Feb.  Families burying loved ones deserve answers. I’ll keep you updated on this.  https://t.co/uGfopRMwW6
.@realdonaldtrump’s disgraceful rhetoric on immigration continues – instead of helping pass meaningful reform, he echoes the same ludicrous, racist calls for "crackdown". In Congress, I’ll keep fighting to #DefendDACA and for real #ImmigrationReform. https://t.co/snvJxVeGzu
The all-out assault @SpeakerRyan, @realdonaldtrump, and their @GOP cronies have waged on #HealthCare has put people's lives at stake and we have a moral obligation to stand up for them. I will always fight to #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/jvRbc9tmnK
Absolutely in love with @the_wing and it's message of women's empowerment! Thank you @audreygelman and Lauren Kassan for bringing us such a necessary community space. Can’t wait to come back soon! https://t.co/9Zs8tHzPYj
Talking to an amazing group of young women with @Grace4NY at @the_wing about what it's like to be a woman in Congress, running for office, and what women bring to the table. Answer to the last question — A LOT!! https://t.co/aQwYzpr6FL
.@KeithPowersNYC knows how important it is to get people to the polls on 6/26 – so we talked to voters this weekend at Tal’s Bagels to remind them about what’s at stake in the primary. Sign up to volunteer and make sure #ny12 knows when it’s time to #VOTE! https://t.co/qDJg6OAR7V https://t.co/f1Jm4C5EzB
Health effects from 9/11 are still devastating our communities, especially first responders. That’s why I fought so hard for the Zadroga bill &amp; I'm pleased to say it’s working. Imp't report about 9/11 survivors &amp; responders getting the help they deserve:  https://t.co/TEepLbPJTF
Glad to have @NCPSSM's endorsement in #ny12 primary on 6/26. Seniors earned #SocialSecurity &amp; #Medicare benefits and it's on us to make sure they keep them. Thx @MaxRichtman for the boxing gloves so we can take the fight to anyone trying to mess w/ them. We're going to need them! https://t.co/tRM6DfvVm3
Happy #MothersDay to all the fierce, tough moms that make the world go round. As we celebrate, let’s also honor our moms by fighting for #EqualPay, #PaidLeave &amp; #ERAnow. We deserve it!
Talked to voters today in Long Island City to remind them about the #ny12 primary June 26. They’re excited to #FlipTheHouse – RT if you are too! #CarolynOnYourCorner #LIC https://t.co/tW4OB5bnwv
.@DickGottfried knows I’m a fighter who gets results for New Yorkers – especially when it comes to making sure every family has affordable &amp; quality #HealthCare. I’m honored to have his support in the June 26 Dem Primary! #ny12 #BlueWave https://t.co/h3gsARxTH1
Thanks @bradhoylman for joining me in Stuytown today to talk to voters about the June 26 primary! Lovely weather and some great conversations. No time like the present to help get the word out to make sure your neighbors #VOTE! https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn #ny12 #CarolynOnYourCorner https://t.co/wYzgGvL9Di
Next month, #ny12 will go to the polls. Humbled by the support I’ve received, from NYC public servants &amp; Dem clubs to #healthcare orgs, #unions &amp; nat'l progressive grps - but we still have work to do. Help get the word out about the primary 6/26: https://t.co/qDJg6OAR7V #BlueWave
Let's call it what it is @realdonaldtrump - it's not fake news, it's news you don't like. You can't be the leader of the free world while also intimidating journalists. #PressFreedom https://t.co/MsBp7dn2Rf
For 8 months, @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have kept #DREAMers living in fear. These Americans deserve answers and a #DACA vote NOW. I'm glad some of my Republican colleagues have decided to stand up to @SpeakerRyan to force a vote. We must #DefendDACA. https://t.co/HPIySWApmR
A big thanks to @Local_802_AFM and @IATSE Local 1 for their support! Proud to have their endorsement and the support of so many stagehands and musicians across #ny12 as we prepare for the June 26 primary. #UnionStrong https://t.co/nvzKf88Azz
Disgusting – bad enough that @MickMulvaneyOMB is destroying the @CFPB from within, but some of my GOP colleagues think there’s no need for safeguards against racial discrimination in auto lending. RT if you think we deserve better than this. #DefendtheCFPB https://t.co/hWrUTRTlh4
Thanks to NY's nursing professionals as we celebrate Nat'l #NursesWeek – thanks for your work to make patients healthier &amp; safer and your tireless advocacy to improve healthcare facilities by fighting for #safestaffing &amp; #HealthCare4All. I’m proud to be your advocate in Congress.
The #CitizenshipQuestion on #2020census was not devised by career employees – it was devised by a partisan political operative who didn’t show up to a hearing about his work yesterday. As @thehill points out, I have questions for him. #EveryoneCounts https://t.co/a3vue28zjE
It's not just the #CitizenshipQuestion - @SecretaryRoss and the @realdonaldtrump admin are asleep on the job with a critical democratic institution - #2020census will affect our democracy for years to come. Why are we shortchanging it? https://t.co/1zKr5uxoIa
.@MickMulvaneyOMB has unleashed a misguided agenda on an institution dedicated to #ConsumerProtection that will cause real harm to ppl. I’ve always fought for consumers and always will. RT to say you’ll vote to #DefendtheCFPB in the #ny12 primary June 26! https://t.co/XfBnGWnyiN
What kind of monsters separate children from their families? @realdonaldtrump and Jeff Sessions. This is NOT how we fix #Immigration. The ruthless tactics need to end – let’s #FlipTheHouse this year so we can pass #ImmigrationReform and #DefendDACA.  https://t.co/okspjJJ4R2
Honored to announce that @PPact is endorsing our campaign! With reproductive rights and healthcare under assault, you can ALWAYS count on me to #StandWithPP &amp; protect women's access to healthcare.

Excited to work with  @GSIDnyc to make the #BlueWave a reality this year. Thanks for hosting me at your luncheon today - and for your support in the #ny12 primary on June 26! https://t.co/bZmHYDLcJI
Celebrated @CRDCNYC’s 60th anniversary today! Excited to work with all its members to #resist Trump and #FlipTheHouse this fall – but to do that we need you to #VOTE in the June 26 NY primary! #ny12 @CoreyinNYC @JerryNadler @bradhoylman @dickgottfried @chriscquinn @carlinarivera https://t.co/FqP5bg8uDh
I hate to say this, but I agree with @SpeakerRyan - cover-ups will end if the Dems take back the House. #BlueWave https://t.co/pHqcyDGTaR
Good! Did we need to be reminded this was a crazy idea in the first place? The @NRA &amp; @GOP delusion needs to end – instead, I’m focusing on real efforts to keep guns away from people that shouldn’t have them, and @SpeakerRyan should be too. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/oNrcQ7wphM
Impt read from @NYTmag - large-scale attacks on our int’l financial system need to be dealt with swiftly. That's why, as the article points out, I pushed the Fed to create a 24/7 hotline to respond to these crises &amp; better defend against cyber attacks https://t.co/vOWyIqqTE6
6-week abortion ban #ialegis passed yesterday is the latest cruel example of men coming btwn a woman &amp; her dr. I’ve worked w @PPFA &amp; @NARAL to protect a woman’s right to choose &amp; #WeWontGoBack. We need an #ERAnow to stop these assaults on women's rights.  https://t.co/26f3LxU41l
Thank you @CarlinaRivera! Looking forward to continuing the fight alongside you for our progressive values. https://t.co/lNBsOHQWIz
Ensuring our background check system works properly is critical to keep guns out of the hands of those that shouldn’t have them. I’m working at the federal level to do just that &amp; proud that @NYGovCuomo is doing the same for NY. We must #EndGunViolenceNOW. https://t.co/xiKIj8nD3w
I’m out talking to voters with @BenKallos to remind folks there are only a few short weeks left before the #ny12 Democratic primary – and I need your help! Sign up to volunteer with our campaign and help me keep up the fight in Congress: https://t.co/vmiPLWz7XY https://t.co/5SEFETcQlV
The momentum continues – thanks @elizabethforma for your support. It’s an honor to team up with you to #DefendTheCFPB from @realDonaldTrump's malicious attacks and fight for stronger #ConsumerProtection. https://t.co/oDMw9gnZFk
Good to see my friend and NY Lieutenant Governor @KathyHochul with the @LexingtonDemsNY this evening – I’m so proud to be fighting with her to #Resist the Trump agenda and #FlipTheHouse this year. #BlueWave2018 https://t.co/RBVqQmLQXn
What an amazing night with @LexingtonDemsNY - Thrilled to be honored by the the first reform Democratic organization in Manhattan. I can’t wait to get to work with all of these great activists and leaders to elect Democrats nationwide and make #BlueWave2018 a reality. #NY12 https://t.co/23LQiGHjWd
So much for an effective watchdog - once again, @MickMulvaneyOMB shamelessly shows his affinity for banks’ bottom lines over consumer interests. That’s why I’ve always worked to hold banks and lenders accountable and #DefendTheCFPB https://t.co/hRQ797hl8F
Thrilled to announce endorsements from @DistCouncil37, @NALC_National Branch 36, the NYS Association of Letter Carriers &amp; @Teamsters Local 237 for the Democratic primary on 6/26 – looking forward to working by your side as we get results for the hard-working people of #ny12. https://t.co/yN63T9EEYb
Great brunch with @DIDNYC today - exciting conversation about everything we’re working on together to #FlipTheHouse and keep getting results for #ny12 - and great bagels, too! https://t.co/y3n7fqhoaB
I’m honored to announce that @EricHolder has endorsed me in the #ny12 primary. We worked closely together when he was #AttorneyGeneral and now we’re fighting to protect #2020Census #CivilRights, #VotingRIghts and so much more. https://t.co/60utQwAFm2
Thanks to #MeToo, #BillCosby was FINALLY convicted after 50 allegations of rape. We owe enormous gratitude to the brave women who stood up and fought back. Now it’s time for #congress to show some spine and pass the #ERA and other protections for #women. https://t.co/UHPNxgLZXo
Thanks @LIDBrooklyn – I’m proud to have your support in the June 26 #ny12 primary and to fight alongside you for #LGBTQ rights. https://t.co/RFLZEnDqv6
.@RepJudyChu is right. It’s not “just” minorities that lose out with a citizenship question on the #2020census. @SecretaryRoss &amp; @realdonaldtrump may do anything for cheap political points, but #EveryoneCounts -that’s why we need to pass my IDEA Act. https://t.co/GRtndzAiqG
It’s about time– we debate #GunControl so much that we forget #GunViolence is a health epidemic. I've pushed to give the @CDCgov funds to research it– glad states are taking matters into their own hands while the @GOP Congress does nothing. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/ZKDrqb7asn
Grateful for your support @sdnyc and honored to stand by your side as we continue the fight for #equality and #LGBTQRights. https://t.co/ar16BE5JJa
Thank you to @DonJaimeLucero, Alfredo Placeres, @NYChamber, &amp; all of Encuentro DC 2018 for honoring me as your Legislator of the Year. Together we will fight for immigrant rights and respect by protecting #DACA &amp; #2020Census and passing #ImmigrationReform. https://t.co/Oo0A6Z7sl7
No surprise, but #DACA holds up in court again today. More evidence that @realdonaldtrump’s hateful policy is just thinly disguised racism. I’ll continue to fight in Congress to make NY a welcoming place for #Dreamers and their families. #DefendDACA  https://t.co/wUXx9AK02R
Congratulations to my friend @HarveyForNY on his election to the #NYSAssembly yesterday. As a fighter for consumers &amp; #tenantsrights, he’ll work tirelessly for New Yorkers in Albany. Looking forward to working w/ you to bring back results for our city! #Harvey4NY @NYSA_Majority
Congratulations to @Shelley4Senate on her #SD37 victory! This is a huge win for women, working families and all New Yorkers. #KeepNY37Blue #BlueWaveComing2018
More evidence that @GOP has this the wrong way around. When it comes to kids, Americans know we need better #GunControl. It’s ONLY @NRA that doesn't. I’ll never stop fighting to end its death grip on Congress – an F rating doesn’t scare me. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/yids9NsxCM
Outrageous is right. These ppl were willing to give their lives for their neighbors and this is what they’ve gotten in return. The Zadroga Act must be protected - @congpeteking @JerryNadler and I are going to ensure these criminals face consequences. #ny12 https://t.co/8uloA0Bakq
Generics should be be lower-cost versions of brand name meds. But some companies may be colluding to drive up prices. That must end. I’m calling for a Congressional investigation into anti-competitive practices that harm too many in #NY12 &amp; across the US https://t.co/Nxs3MLhbCa https://t.co/SMMH4sJ2bp
Out campaigning with @HarveyforNY this afternoon – he’s spent his life fighting for tenant rights and we need his voice for the 74th district in Albany. Tomorrow, you can make it happen – make sure you go #VOTE in tomorrow’s special election. #BlueWave https://t.co/X7LWFm1XJc
Appalling that some would prey on sick &amp; injured #911 first responders &amp; survivors. This is the last thing these people need in their lives. The @FTC needs to launch an immediate investigation to bring these miserable lowlifes to justice. #911Health  https://t.co/Ex7SHQzEvy
Providing #911health care to the victims of that tragic day has been one of my proudest achievements. I am urging the @FTC to do what’s right and investigate these scammers so we can protect heroes such as @UFANYC, @UFOA854 &amp; @NYCPBA. @911HealthWatch https://t.co/IjV1NKNPsU
Especially on this #earthday, I’m proud to have @SierraClub by my side in the #ny12 primary on June 26 as we stand together to #resist the disastrous environmental policies of @realdonaldtrump’s administration and work to make our Earth a cleaner, safer place for all. https://t.co/xNPaD1YQEm
A lot can change in a year. This #earthday let’s pledge to do more so that one year from now we can look back and say we made progress for a cleaner, healthier environment. I’ll be fighting to keep #AmericasPledge, #BanTheBag, &amp; more. https://t.co/sjrh2a6eAt
Can't we all agree that healthcare for sick &amp; injured 9/11 responders &amp; survivors shouldn't be messed with? I, &amp; many others, fought for years to pass the Zadroga Act. We'll be damned if this Administration tears it down. #Resist https://t.co/9to39TcvaV
Honored to accept the Beth R. Cosmos Award for Democratic Leadership at @tildendemocrats this evening. Thanks, as always, for your continued support as we get results for families in #ny12. https://t.co/fQ8YvKQDW9
I’m so impressed with Lane and all of the other committed students leading walkouts tomorrow. The movement for #GunControl is building. As we mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, let's all redouble our efforts to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/tJDFrfzvRJ
I agree with @RepJoseSerrano: many will refuse to respond to the #2020census citizenship q. "Striving” to get an accurate count isn’t enough, @SecretaryRoss – that’s why Congress needs to pass my IDEA Act to end the question. #EveryoneCounts https://t.co/T3kGrH5mSL
This isn’t news – we know the vast majority of Americans support common-sense #GunControl. The problem is getting Republicans in Congress to stop doing the @NRA’s bidding. No more excuses. Time to hold them accountable on election day. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/7jQaVkI3KY
I've always fought for #women's rights &amp; it's always been an uphill battle. But I've also never given up. It's time our nation has a Smithsonian museum dedicated to the inspiring achievements of women and the impact they've had on our country. #CantStopWontStop https://t.co/huVJEXynxw
This #TaxDay, @realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP are trying to tout the #GOPTaxScam as a win. But a plan that raises taxes on middle class families in NY is a loser. We need to #FlipTheHouse to make sure voters aren’t nickel-and-dimed by this disastrous “reform.” https://t.co/X0JWgI0tgo
.@MTA needs to improve pedestrian safety around Penn Station. There's too much congestion and it's putting people at risk. I'm proud to join with @JerryNadler @NY31Alcantara @bradhoylman @DickGottfried @CoreyInNYC &amp; @GaleBrewerNYC to call for action now. https://t.co/GHC4nluQ5I
We need answers from @SecretaryRoss and @realdonaldtrump on the motivation for the #2020Census citizenship question. The Constitution requires EVERYONE be counted. In Congress, I'm working to get to the bottom of this and make sure #EveryoneCounts in 2020. https://t.co/F092QX1IvU
Important new Harvard study on self-defense gun use. 2 big takeaways:  1) The "risks of owning a gun outweigh the benefits of having one" 2) We need more of these, which is why I authored a bill w/@EdMarkey to fund #GunSafety research. #EnoughisEnough https://t.co/aOeJhkzBrE
Thank you @KeithPowersNYC, couldn’t be more excited to partner with leaders like you to deliver results for NYers &amp; to elect Dems across the country.  #BlueWaveIsComing2018 #NY12 https://t.co/iLymJANg8X

Thank you @chelseahandler - We are working hard to ensure #BlueWave2018 and to elect Democrats who stand for #GunControl #MedicareForAll &amp; who will #resist @realDonaldTrump’s disastrous agenda. https://t.co/rdQxBRva7K
I fought to create the @CFPB &amp; wrote the CARD Act that's saving people $12 billion/yr by outlawing abusive credit card fees and penalties. @realdonaldtrump wants to roll that all back. That’s why we need to #FlipTheHouse &amp; I’m fighting to make sure we do. https://t.co/bEiDI4LrY1
I've authored the IDEA Act to block the citizenship question &amp; protect the #2020census. All of us need to work together to make sure @realdonaldtrump &amp; the @GOP can’t rig the #2020census for partisan gain. Click here to join the fight: https://t.co/7C8MmosOQX #EveryoneCounts
The Trump admin has taken the cop off the beat on #ConsumerProtection. I fought to create the @CFPB &amp; have heard from so many families who have benefited from it. I won’t let a critical institution be run into the ground by @CFPBDirector Mulvaney. #Resist https://t.co/o2kCOaiQ0T
Glad @DemRedistrict is joining so many states, like NY, in fighting the citizenship q. A rigged census will harm NY, so I’m sponsoring the IDEA Act to block this q &amp; leading an amicus brief to support lawsuits to ensure #EveryoneCounts in the #2020census. https://t.co/k8PUUDJdKO
Honored to have the support of an org w/such an incredible record of supporting women. We've worked hard and delivered results – from healthcare for 9/11 responders &amp; survivors to critical infrastructure for NYC. Can’t wait to keep working together in #ny12 &amp; across the country! https://t.co/ct95PUGG6I

It is unacceptable that women are still paid, on average, 80% of their male counterparts. This #EqualPayDay, I am asking you all to join me in the fight for #EqualPayForEqualWork. RT to join this fight. https://t.co/8uTjDu2tNm
I'm continuing to hold @realdonaldtrump and @SecretaryRoss accountable for trying to politicize the #2020Census with their hateful citizenship question. Yet another reason (as if we needed more) we need to elect a Democratic House in November. #BlueWave  https://t.co/ULE5qEc2sU
I hosted a #TownHallForOurLives with @ReElectNydia and #GunSafety advocates Saturday to discuss how we can enact real #GunReform. I consistently earn an F from the #NRA and wear it as a badge of honor - this year we must elect lawmakers who will do the same. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/6lnpMYs2RR
Thank you @BrianKavanaghNY @NYAGV1 @GAGnoguns @Bradybuzz for supporting this critical background check legislation - a much needed #GunReform. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/nG2zmDoTBH
In the wake of the financial crisis, I authored the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights, which is saving people $12 billion/year, &amp; fought to create the @CFPB. Now @CFPBDirector Mulvaney wants to gut these new protections. I'm fighting back. RT to  join me. https://t.co/ZrN2zxBP5l
It's the last weekend of petitioning to get on the ballot for #ny12! Join us for the final push as we talk to our neighbors about the results we’ve delivered for NYC, from #healthcare for 9/11 responders to #infrastructure $$, to #ConsumerProtection laws. https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
Thanks to @MomsDemand for their incredible work to pass real #GunSafety reforms that will save lives. I’m thrilled to be selected as one of your #GunSense candidates this year. #GunReformNOW https://t.co/3TUX5WMSDS
I'm leading the #resistance in Congress against Trump's efforts to politicize the #2020Census to hurt diverse states like NY. My 2020 IDEA Act will block the citizenship q &amp; I'm working on an amicus brief supporting @AGSchneiderman's lawsuit.  RT if you agree #everyonecounts. https://t.co/vK1b5TB6NE
I'm honored to have earned the support of @NYSAFLCIO in our campaign for #ny12. From providing healthcare to 9/11 first responders to securing critical investments in NYC infrastructure, I'm proud of my record of results for the working women and men of our great city. https://t.co/517mo9MnxJ
The @GOP failure to pass meaningful #GunSafety laws has hurt one group above all: our kids. Now, they’re making their voices heard. It’s time for @SpeakerRyan to listen. #EnoughIsEnough
Somehow, the fight for equality rages on – we’ve consistently failed to give women the legal protection they deserve. That’s why I’ve doubled down on my longstanding efforts to enshrine women’s equality in the constitution with the #ERA. It’s time to pass #ERANow.
My IDEA Act makes sure the #Census stays true to the spirit of the U.S. Constitution – and isn’t politicized by the Trump administration. #2020Census https://t.co/L2ISYbGd4p

Big anniversary last week for #ACA. But even with unprecedented signups, the law faces an existential threat from @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP. That’s why I’m working w/ @morethanmySLE &amp; other grassroots advocates to #ProtectOurCare – both here in NYC, and across the country.
Tomorrow’s a new day of petitioning in #ny12 – which day this weekend will you join us? https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
It is clearly not enough to aspire to gender equality - if it were, we would have #EqualPayForEqualWork. We must take action: women's equality must be added to our Constitution. I'll keep fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, no matter how long it takes. #ERAnow
It's an honor to have your support, @AFSCME @DistCouncil37. I look forward to our continued work together for workers' rights and working families! #ny12 https://t.co/jK2fHWK0Co
Thanks to City Council Members @bradlander and @KeithPowersNYC for their help petitioning today! Let’s keep up the momentum this weekend – join our team and make sure we’ve got what it takes to keep fighting for #ny12 in the House! https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn https://t.co/tS8UTmFw2E
Still stunning that even after #MarchForOurLives @GOP leaders are playing political games with our children’s lives. We need #GunReformNOW. Sign on if you agree #EnoughIsEnough: https://t.co/63PqMGggs5
“Our friend, our advocate, our glass ceiling shatterer, Carolyn Maloney.” — Thanks to City Council Speaker @CoreyinNYC for joining us at our #LGBT event last night! I’m honored to have your support for #ny12 https://t.co/c6b3kMFL1H
Last week was a huge milestone in the fight to combat online sex trafficking with the Senate’s passage of #FOSTA #SESTA - a bill I co-authored. Survivors and law enforcement now have the tools to seek justice and prevent others from being trafficked online. #TimesUp
Truly inspired by the massive success of #MarchForOurLives this weekend. I was at #MarchForOurLivesNYC and was blown away by the passion and commitment from these high schoolers. Change is coming to #EndGunViolenceNOW. #Enough https://t.co/jDlSNSK1bf
.@SecretaryRoss's citizenship question on the #2020Census cripples a critical institution. It's vital that we get a complete count of everyone living in the US – not one cooked for partisan gain. I introduced the IDEA Act to preserve #Census integrity. https://t.co/1wKFXKAG8l
I’m proud to have received endorsements from so many strong Democratic clubs in #ny12 – not to mention from awesome progressive orgs like @NARAL, @NWPCNYC, &amp; @NOW_NYC. Share now to say you’re with them in standing up to the Trump admin’s divisive rhetoric and policy! #Resist https://t.co/duvzTyDvkC
I am so grateful and honored to have your support! #ny12 https://t.co/GnukC3KRNi
Today we join students across the country in the #MarchForOurLives as together we say: #GunReformNow. And this is just the beginning. These students have made clear they won’t accept the status quo. Change is coming. https://t.co/RtXqNR4JaM
Tomorrow, thousands of Americans across the country will join together to #MarchForOurLives. I am very excited to join #marchforourlivesnyc, and encourage all of you to come out and march with me! Hope to see you there. https://t.co/TG2QfDQTdz
We’ve seen unprecedented stonewalling from @GOP on #GunSafety, and yet we know how this ends. I won’t stop fighting for #GunReform, no matter how small. I refuse to let the #NRA define the narrative. #EnoughIsEnough
It’s an honor to be your voice in the House, and fight for New York families -- but I can’t do it without your support. Can I count on you to get some friends together this weekend and help us gather petition signatures? #ny12 https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
In the era of #TimesUp and #MeToo, we must leverage activism to bring about real change. We won’t stop fighting until #EqualityForAll is a Constitutional guarantee – not just an aspiration. #ERAnow
.@SpeakerRyan and other R’s in Congress think they can avoid public opinion on #GunSafety if they just keep putting it on the back burner. But that’s not going to happen. Tell Congress you won’t give up until we protect our kids and families. #GunReformNow https://t.co/63PqMGggs5
Big shoutout to all the Democrats that have stepped up to #Resist this year, and the myriad clubs across NYC that are helping #FlipTheHouse and #ElectDemocrats. This is our shot to turn #RedToBlue. If you haven’t already – Volunteer. Join us this weekend: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
#WomensHealth in this country is under assault. That’s why I’m redoubling my efforts to combat fake women’s health clinics and pass the #ERANow – because we can’t let the administration tear away the incredible progress we’ve made for women across this country. #Resist
The shooting in MD yesterday reminds us how far we have to go to implement meaningful #GunSafety laws. As we send thoughts and prayers to this community, let’s commit to holding legislators accountable to rejecting the toxic #NRA agenda and passing #GunReformNow. #EnoughIsEnough.
A citizenship question on the census would attack families that contribute to the social fabric of America – and it’s despicable. That’s why I’ve stood against the anti-immigration stances of @realDonaldTrump and his cronies attacking #Dreamers and their loved ones. #DreamActNow
I’ve fought to get the #ERA passed 11 times during my time in Congress. We have a unique opportunity now to turn activism into change. It’s time to send a message to the anti-women @GOP Congress – stand with women or lose our support. #TimesUp #ERAnow https://t.co/xoKPsCWpBd
The right to vote is one of our most essential freedoms - but New Yorkers often face unnecessary barriers to exercising that right. Proud to stand with @LetNYvote today to call for #EarlyVoting in New York! #LetNYvote #ny12 https://t.co/vM1g4LY0jE
Beautiful day to be petitioning with @Rebecca76AD - thanks to all those who have helped out this weekend to help make sure I can keep fighting for #ny12 in the House! https://t.co/XGOM0907Pb
Yet another beautiful day to gather petition signatures - thanks to @villagedemocrat for their help yesterday! Sign up now to make sure we’ve got what it takes to #resist the Trump administration’s destructive agenda this year: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn #ny12 https://t.co/jUoLmYRxv3
I had a fantastic time spending #StParticksDay2018 with leaders from across #NYC. I look forward to continuing our work together on #WomensHealth #GunControl &amp; fighting for our shared progressive values on behalf of #ny12! https://t.co/5cNBaUNBd3
The #StPatricksDay2018 festivities keep on coming! Great #StPattysDay event w/ @LexingtonDemsNY &amp; it’s great to be surrounded by such fantastic supporters as I run for re-election in #ny12! And a BIG thank you you to our #FirstResponders and the @FDNY! You keep our city safe! https://t.co/VwvwPh9djX
We now have 144 signatures on the #ERA - a bill I've introduced 11 times! We have a unique opportunity this #WomensHistoryMonth to finally guarantee women's equality in the Constitution and provide the legal bedrock we need to fight discrimination and harassment. #ERAnow #TimesUp
Love it! We'll be out there all weekend, too - Be like Liz and Emily and sign up to volunteer now: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn #ny12 https://t.co/SWQ8oqU3le
Join us this weekend as we gather more signatures to ensure I can keep fighting for #ny12 in the House. With your support, we will continue to #resist the Trump agenda and tell the @GOP   that we won’t abide their attacks on women &amp; families. https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn #FlipTheHouse
.@realdonaldtrump’s attacks on #ConsumerProtection laws show an ignorance of history. 10 years ago, consumers were hit by the worst crash since the Great Depression. @CFPB and others help prevent more – but not if the administration continues to strip their authority. #Resist
If @ConorLambPA can win in #pa18 – a district @realdonaldtrump won by 20 points – we can win anywhere. That's I’m working to contest every seat and #FlipTheHouse from #RedToBlue this fall! https://t.co/m0NLuOozdi
It’s long past time that women’s rights were enshrined in the Constitution. Call your members of Congress this week – tell them to stand with me in supporting the #ERA. In the era of #MeToo, we must use this moment to make lasting change. #WomensHistoryMonth
#GunSafety isn’t a political game. Our children’s lives are at stake. Tell Congress #EnoughIsEnough and we can’t keep playing politics. https://t.co/63PqMGggs5 #EndGunViolenceNOW
I can't recommend @es_indivisible's “What’s Happening in Albany” panels enough. Join the group this week to talk about how we #ProtectDREAMers amidst Republican intransigence in Albany and Washington. #ImmigrationReformNow https://t.co/9KGa5BKRD0
Despite outcry from educators everywhere, @realdonaldtrump still insists on arming teachers. Yet he, @SpeakerRyan, and others won’t even consider common sense, popular legislation – like my bill to close the gun show loophole. #EnoughIsEnough #GunSafety https://t.co/EVWLm8NerO
Thanks to the over 200 people who came out to show their support at my annual St. Patrick’s Day Leadership Breakfast! Great to see so many familiar and new faces ready to help #FlipTheHouse this year. Honored and inspired to continue to fight for you in #ny12. https://t.co/GCTsVlwd3d
Spoke with some fellow strong women at @Queens_Dems today. Look out, @realdonaldtrump - they’re already working hard to make sure the House goes #RedtoBlue this year! #ny12 https://t.co/J6m7P5z4zq
ICYMI: Our #NY12 campaign was endorsed by @reshmasaujani: “Carolyn Maloney is a tenacious fighter for New York..." https://t.co/evlr68uipP
Excited to have the endorsement of the Village Reform Democratic Club! Thanks to Ray Cline and @tcude for hosting me last night – I look forward to continuing to work together on behalf of New York families and #resist  @realDonaldTrump's disastrous agenda. #NY12 https://t.co/w4hiY5esYi
Honored to have the endorsement of the Progressive Caucus this week as we work together to #FlipTheHouse this fall: #CarolynFightsForUs https://t.co/M9nLrgDgnR
As we speak, I’m standing with @JuliaBrownley26, @CheriBustos, @Elizabeth_Esty, @AnnMcLaneKuster, and @SMurphyCongress, @JerryNadler and @NitaLowey making sure we can #FlipTheHouse and defend critical blue seats this fall! #CarolynFightsForUs https://t.co/nDw9iKF21F
We know we can #FlipTheHouse this year – but that means standing united. That’s why I’m so excited to support @JuliaBrownley26, @CheriBustos, @Elizabeth_Esty, @AnnMcLaneKuster, @SMurphyCongress, and @Ann_Kirkpatrick on #IWD2018. #FierceOnTheFrontline https://t.co/m0NLuOozdi
I’m honored to have the support of every other public servant in #ny12. But to make sure I can keep fighting for New York families in Congress, we have work to do. Sign up now to help us gather signatures this weekend: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn #CarolynFightsForUs #IWD2018
Winter Storm #Quinn won’t stop Maloney volunteers today! Thanks @lauren_chou for your hard work. Join Lauren to help make sure we’ve got the signatures we need to win: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn #ny12 #FierceFighter https://t.co/eKDbkeuqyU
.@realdonaldtrump doesn’t see the need for any of these measures – that’s why you can count on me to #resist his anti-consumer agenda every step of the way. #consumerprotection [2/2]
Consumer protection has never been an afterthought for me. I wrote the Credit Card Holders’ Bill of Rights, championed the @CFPB &amp; cracked down on unfair overdraft policies &amp; ATM fees. [1/2]
Tell @SpeakerRyan – no more inaction on #GunSafety. Sign my petition to show him you know #EnoughisEnough #NeverAgain: https://t.co/63PqMFYF3v
This year’s election is critical, that’s why I’m devoting additional efforts to helping @DCCC defend Democratic seats in Congress and help others go #RedtoBlue. It’ll take a team effort to #FliptheHouse! Do your part by signing up with my campaign today: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
“If it wasn’t for Carolyn,” Lebow said, “I wouldn’t be here today.” Maloney Officially Announces Her #ny12 Re-Election Campaign https://t.co/so9y4oc7ht
No one’s been a stronger fighter for New York families than I have – that’s why I’ve been endorsed by every single public servant in #NY12. Stand with them now to make your voice heard &amp; make sure I’ve got what I need to keep fighting for you in Congress! https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
Thank you Coalition for a District Alternative (CODA) for your #NY12 endorsement! Let's continue the fight against @realDonaldTrump's disastrous agenda &amp; stand up for progressive policies! https://t.co/qh93tPjY8W
Thank you @reshmasaujani for your endorsement. Together we will continue the fight for women's advancement and against @realDonaldTrump's regressive &amp; divisive agenda.#WomensHistoryMonth #Resist https://t.co/iuPuMhTh73
It's shameful and we must #resist.  #consumerprotection https://t.co/34EQqElTVQ
.@realDonaldTrump's deliberate weakening of @CFPB is sickening. From budget cuts to poor staffing choices, this Administration seeks to undermine the agency when working Americans more than ever need strong protections to protect them from overreach and abuse of financial law.
.@realdonaldtrump doesn’t value women – it’s that simple. That’s why I’ve led the charge against his repeated attacks on #WomensHealth by fighting to maintain access to @ppfa clinics and other life-saving health providers women and families depend on. #Resist
.@bradhoylman, she’s a progressive leader in waiting! I’m looking forward to continuing to partner with you to make the world better for her &amp; all children. https://t.co/JBfoR2D9ob
Thank you for your support! The #ZadrogaAct was one of my proudest accomplishments. It is our responsibility as a grateful nation: https://t.co/CGBMsjmr5X https://t.co/tePxdvQwjs
Thrilled to join the historic @villagedemocrat VID club for their petitioning kickoff &amp; look forward to joining them out on the streets. https://t.co/L9iCvwirVa
Officially launched my re-election today at our new campaign office! Thanks to everyone from #ny12 who came out and signed up to help get me on the ballot! It’s time to get to work – make sure you sign up now: https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn https://t.co/sIJjzKCjHl
…From standing up for women’s rights to strengthening consumer protections to ensuring access to quality, affordable healthcare. Thank you for your endorsement @ElectProgress! we will succeed in our fight to #Resist @realDonaldTrump!
Honored &amp; thrilled to have @ElectProgress’ endorsement as the true progressive in #NY12! I have spent my career in Congress fighting for exactly what the Progressive Caucus stands for…
You won’t find a harder fighter for you in Congress – from #GunSafety to women’s health care to consumer protection. But I can’t do it alone. We need volunteers to ensure we can keep fighting for our progressive values! Sign up here: https://t.co/qDJg6OAR7V
Why has @realdonaldtrump told our nation’s school children that he wants to close loopholes on #GunSafety when his own budget proposal cuts our nation’s background check system? Add your name if you’re sick of the hypocrisy: https://t.co/63PqMGggs5 #EndGunViolenceNOW
T-minus two days! Make sure you’ve signed up to join us at our office opening Saturday. Join the fight against the #TrumpAgenda: https://t.co/Yd0nM24cjv
If you’re as fed up as I am with the @GOP’s inaction on #GunSafety legislation – then it’s time to make your voice heard. I’m fighting to save lives by keeping guns away from those with mental illnesses. You can show you’re with me here: https://t.co/63PqMGggs5
I’m officially opening my #ny12 campaign office this week. Join my team to help #resist the Trump agenda and keep up the fight in Congress - I can’t do it without you! https://t.co/qDJg6Ojggn
ICYMI: I’m proud to have earned the support of every elected official in my district. I couldn’t pick a better group of people to stand beside as we stand up to Trump in New York and in Congress. #Resist #NY12 https://t.co/ZiTPNqhu6a
Thank you @LexingtonDemsNY! Together, we will continue to #resist @realDonaldTrump, fight for #GunContolNow and stand up for all New Yorkers! https://t.co/sXBVUjLTzi
The #AssaultWeaponsBan saves lives. So why does @GOP think it’s okay to keep allowing unfettered access to military-grade weapons? The fight for #GunSafety goes on – and I’m not going anywhere until we have commonsense laws that protect our kids. #EndGunViolenceNOW
Along with @AnnLWagner, I’ve led the charge to crack down on #HumanTrafficking. Our bill to prevent online sex trafficking will come to the House floor this week – it empowers survivors and families and gives law enforcement the tools needed to fight these horrendous crimes.
We’ve said #EnoughIsEnough too many times. It’s time for action. That’s why I’ve introduced bills that would save lives, from closing the gun show loophole to funding public health research. Add your name to say you’re with me to #EndGunViolenceNow: https://t.co/63PqMGggs5
I’m incredibly honored to have the support of so many dedicated public servants in #NY12 across Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn. Thank you for your perseverance as we #Resist the Trump agenda and fight to improve the lives of working New Yorkers.  https://t.co/ZiTPNqhu6a
The #GOPTaxScam and #TrumpBudget seek to balance the budget on the backs of New York’s working and middle class. It is up to us New Yorkers to make our voices heard, #Resist this disastrous budget &amp; stand up for all New Yorkers. #ResistTrump
Today I stand with @AFLCIO, Mario Cilento, @TishJames and @NYGovCuomo on behalf of workers across this country - unions are the backbone of our nation and I will continue to fight to #UnrigtheSystem for all Americans and protect and expand their rights in the workplace. https://t.co/rcVg8UorZb
Where do the President’s priorities lie? With the #NRA, or with the families of inevitable future victims? #EnoughIsEnough [4/4]
Instead, I’m redoubling my efforts to push Congress keep guns out of the hands of violent abusers and those with mental illnesses. [3/ ]
.@realdonaldtrump says he’s invested in preventing further gun violence, but #TrumpBudget calls for a 16% cut in our nation’s background check system for firearms. https://t.co/68qAOWNo2m [2/ ]
Republican rhetoric on #GunSafety is as empty as ever. Here's yet another example. [1/ ]
The #TrumpBudget adds insult to injury on the heels of the #TrumpTaxScam which gave billions in tax cuts to corporations &amp; the ultra-wealthy. We must protect #Medicare, which provides health insurance to 58 million Americans &amp; stand up for our most vulnerable. #ResistTrump
No surprise, but in just the first few hours of #CPAC2018, @Mike_Pence and others have already echoed false claims about #GunSafety, insulted #Dreamers, and propagated the very division they rail against. It is imperative we fight their hateful rhetoric with meaningful action. https://t.co/vnMvccqjED
Grateful to have @LenoxHillDC’s endorsement as I run for re-election in #NY12. I look forward to continuing to work with the Club’s fantastic and dedicated Democratic activists to ensure that our shared progressive ideals are heard and that together we can #ResistTrump. https://t.co/jtsFb9PDal
Thanks, @soniaossorio. From #MeToo to #DACA to #GunSafety - you’ve been an incredible advocate for New Yorkers. I look forward to working with you and everyone at @NOW_NYC to continue our efforts to #resist the destructive Trump agenda. https://t.co/M9zesgMnof
.@realdonaldtrump repealed a longstanding @BarackObama policy that helped keep guns away from the mentally ill. I’m proposing we make that provision law. We need to hold Republicans accountable to empty rhetoric on #GunSafety. #GunReformNOW #EnoughIsEnough #ParklandStrong
The Trump admin has been mind-bogglingly blasé about threats to our democracy. In 2016 I led calls to investigate Russian interference &amp; #RussiaCollusion – now @realdonaldtrump needs to act. We should enforce sanctions that passed Congress last year with bipartisan support.
New Yorkers need a budget that makes it easier for them to get ahead. So why, in the city our President likes to call home, does the #TrumpBudget propose cutting low-income housing assistance? I will fight to reject the #TrumpRentHike and #resist attacks on working families.
.@RoKhanna, I'm honored to have your support and call you a friend. We've already teamed up to combat sexual assault and protect women's healthcare and I am looking forward to doing even more for the progressive values we both cherish. https://t.co/WGn0Fc3v8N
I agree with Dr. Rosenberg in @politico- #GunViolence is a public health emergency. That's why I've led the fight to take the NRA’s handcuffs off pub. health researchers so they can help solve the epidemic killing &gt;30k Americans every year. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/e17czjFGlO
I wrote the Zadroga law, along with @JerryNadler and @congpeteking, to make sure 9/11 responders and survivors could get the health care they need. @realdonaldtrump is proposing to take that away. You can count on me to fight to ensure that doesn't happen. https://t.co/u0DBIjC71j
Thank you for your support! https://t.co/3uM3Qn1hXK
From reproductive rights to paid leave, I've stood on the front lines of the fight for equality during my time in Congress. I'm proud to stand with so many other women running to make change this year all over the country. #runforsomething #BlueWave2018 https://t.co/olBG7omMic
(1) Universal background checks. (2) Keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, domestic abusers and people with serious mental health issues. (3) No military-style assault weapons for civilians. #GunReformNow [2/2]
#Gunsafety isn’t hard, it really isn’t – unless you’re in the pocket of the gun manufacturers’ lobby. There are three points that 80% of all Americans or more agree on. [1/2]
Great conversation with the Chelsea Reform Democratic Club and @ERDCNYC last night. I’m thrilled to have your support this year and look forward to working together for the city that we love so much! #ny12 https://t.co/k9nhrUe8TH
Thanks, @FourFreedomsNYC! Looking forward to working with a passionate and engaged group of leaders in #ny12 as we #resist Trump and continue the fight for a progressive agenda for working families! https://t.co/iA8NJDbTNs
When a President takes a full week to say he supports women – it rings a little hollow. Throughout my career, I have never hesitated. I’m proud to stand up for women, every single day. #MeToo  https://t.co/AuPhv7U1MW
.@SpeakerRyan continues to use fear-mongering rhetoric as people die from preventable shootings. When will he decide #EnoughIsEnough and support meaningful action to keep our children safe? #GunReformNow https://t.co/jjWDgz4PJ9
No parent should have to fear for their children’s safety as they send them off to school every morning.  @SpeakerRyan and @GOP, stop catering to the NRA and start caring about our children. We need meaningful action on #gunsafety NOW. #EnoughIsEnough
That’s because Republicans in Congress and the Senate are beholden to backwards policy on #ImmigrationReform defined by bigotry – not common-sense policy that attracts talent and diversity. #StopDeportations #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/E8GBsf8Mko
Big win for #Dreamers this week. In Congress, I’m fighting hard to make sure @SpeakerRyan allows a fair and open discussion on legislative solutions for #DACA to keep families from being separated by our failing immigration policy.    https://t.co/fmKrpH6Irf
The #TrumpBudget is a disaster for American families – with giant cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, reductions in critical environmental programs, and burdensome restrictions on low-income Americans trying to provide for themselves. We are better than this – we will #Resist.
As someone who has spent her life fighting for sexual assault prevention, I’m proud the House Oversight Committee agreed to my request to investigate the failure of our athletic institutions to protect young women in the #LarryNassar scandal. #TimesUp https://t.co/BIYUIF1Jlw
Big thanks to @FourFreedomsNYC for your endorsement last night! I’m honored to have your strong support in this race. https://t.co/stZffAUmTD
The Trump #Infrastructure plan is a sad attempt to fulfill a grandiose set of promises. Under the plan, critical New York transit infrastructure would actually lose funding, pushing projects back years – and we all know we can’t wait that long.   https://t.co/mvtil627dB
I've spent my whole life fighting for women's health. Attempts to block access to @PPFA clinics are further evidence that this is the most hostile administration towards women ever. I am working with @RepCummings to ensure women aren't cut off from care. https://t.co/dU8PVTtOeS
Proud to be part of the effort to re-elect great Democrats to the House and stand with @CheriBustos at @dccc’s ‘Fierce on the Frontline’ panel today. Fantastic discussion on how we’ll organize to #FliptheHouse this fall! https://t.co/DYgsuNoPnf
If @SenateMajLdr can promise a vote on a bipartisan #DreamAct to protect more than 800,000 #Dreamers from being deported, then so can @SpeakerRyan.  Without that guarantee, I will be voting against this latest budget bill. #Resist
Thank you @HKDemsNYC for your endorsement last night. I'm so honored to represent so much of your neighborhood and look forward to working together for our city and our country.
Proud to be part of the #SOTUBLACKOUT, honor #RecyTaylor, and show the world that #TimesUp. https://t.co/vWZD90X6di

The 2017 #WomensMarch was one of the most impt &amp; inspiring moments of my lifetime. It helped ignite the amazing push for women's rights we've seen this year.

Q30: what are you and democrats doing to show you can govern if you regain the majority?
A29: Im a strong supporter of the 2state solution &amp; oppose settlements. End to the conflict must be agreed by the parties &amp; can’t be imposed
Q29; when will u stop reflexively supporting Netanyahu &amp; the settler fringe who are making a democratic Jewish Israel impossible to sustain?
A28: As with anything, it would depend on how it is actually structured, but it has the potential to be very beneficial if done fairly
Q28: do you support a NYS carbon tax?
A27: Its more impt than ever 2 be a united front fighting for liberal ideals. New DNC leaders is a great partnership let's follow their lead
Q27: how can the Democratic Party regain liberals trust after the effort to sabotage Sanders?
A26 We all have issues that matter most to us. Take that passion &amp; use it to get involved. Apathy is how we lose &amp; involvement is how we win
Q26: what are the most pressing issues for citizens to engage on to protect our country?
A25: Extreme poverty is a humanitarian issue. Ill cont 2 support aid 4 those who need it most. Diplomacy &amp; internatl devlpment keep US safe
Q25: what are you doing to ensure that we are supporting those most in need around the world despite pressure to cut funding for aid?
A24: I support stronger campaign finance reform &amp; overturning Citizens United. Corps r prohibited frm donating directly 2 federal candidates
Q24: are you willing to give up corporate funding and encourage your colleagues to do the same?
A23: Only if you r a constituent or have a compelling story that might grab their attention. Dems need to work across the aisle where we can

A22: I expect to attend the march
Q22: are you participating in the NYC Climate March?

Q21: how easy/difficult is it for Ryan to reintroduce a revised version of his health care bill?
A20: We must pass #ERAnow so that womens rights are finally in the constitution. Would give women legal standing 2 argue for equal treatment
Q20: wages for women with disabilities are 82.5% of those for men with disabilities. What can be done to help disabled women?
A19: Each of us must do our part to stand up for our rights &amp; beliefs. I hope that, as his representative, Pres will hear me loud and clear.
Q19: Do you think you have a special responsibility to oppose Trump because he's from your congressional district?
A18: Hopefully the Senate Intelligence Committee will pursue this.
Q18: Flynn has agreed to testify for immunity, is there any way to get around Nunes to have him testify?
A17: Both! It is clear that women's healthcare is under attack, we should use every option we can think of to protect and advance coverage
Q17: should we be working on new programs in support of women's health or sustain historic ones?
A16: Yes, I do. Single payer is the ultimate goal so that all Americans have access to high quality, affordable healthcare.
Q16: do you support a single payer health care system?
A15: For now and the foreseeable future, Trump is President and we must continue to fight for our beliefs and values
Q15: how long do you think Trump will last in office?
A14: I oppose the GOP bill giving ISPs the right to monetize private data &amp; will continue to fight any legislation that threatens privacy

A13: Building in NYC is unlike building anywhere else. It's more complicated/difficult/expensive due to our unique infrastructure
Q13: why did the 2nd Ave subway cost twice as much as similar projects in other countries?
A12: I hope not but different pressures could make them change. I'll keep working to protect funding for research, it's too important to cut
Q12: are your rep colleagues who have traditionally supported scientific research really going to get behind these cuts to research funding?
A11: Vaccines are vital to keep children &amp; all of us safe from debilitating and preventable diseases. But research can lead to improvements
Q11: could you clarify your views on vaccines and autism in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus?
A10: We cant back down. Getting anything passed will be difficult but we should focus on possible common sense bipartisan #gunsafety reforms
Q10: we know you support common sense gun legislation, what can you do to promote this issue in congress?
A9: Yes. Millions of low-income women could lose access to healthcare if states withhold Title X $ from clinics that perform abortions.
Q9: please discuss VP pence's tie-breaking senate vote on Title X? Will this affect women's health?
A8 Ive called for an investigation in2 Pres’s business entanglements bc no1 shld profit off the presidency. GOP has blocked an investigation
Q8: is congress investigating the possible violation by Trump of the emoluments clause?
A7: Members of Congress must buy their healthcare on the insurance exchanges, just like anyone else who doesn’t get employer-based coverage.
Q7: do you think members of congress should have the same health care as citizens?
A6 Dems in the senate are doing everything they can 2 stop Gorsuch nomination. Only Senators can filibuster but Im opposed 2 his appointment
Q6: how can we stop the Gorsuch nomination/are you going to filibuster Gorsuch?
A5: Ive asked DOJ 2 create an anti-Semitism taskforce. We must raise awareness which is why I hosted 2 public events w Jewish leaders in Mar
Q5: what are you doing to protect Jewish New Yorkers?
A4 Rs have majority in the House. no committee can launch investigation unless GOP authorizes it. Dems must keep up pressure in the meantime
Q4: what authority do you have as a democrat on the oversight committee and how do you plan on using it?
A3: Not according late Justice Scalia who said the Const. does not prohibit discrimination on basis of sex.
Q3: is the ERA redundant with the 14th amendment?
A2: I'm interested in any bill that betters current burdensome process. Immigration is an impt part of US economy &amp; culture. We need reform
Q2: are you interested in sponsoring a bill to help green card holders to apply for US citizenship more quickly than current law?
A1: Get out there and get involved. Join a campaign or local political club. Cont. being an active participant in the process. Vote!

Americans rely on Social Security. @HillaryClinton's plan will strengthen the program, not bankrupt it https://t.co/PHgyEuo3rL
.@HillaryClinton's foreign policy plan is rooted in knowledge learned from dealing with these issues first hand. https://t.co/ayF061Wfpq
A person who speaks abt women the way #Trump has his whole life isn't fit to lead the USA. It's not #LockerRoomTalk. It's misogyny &amp; assault
In the #TrumpTapes, Donald clearly admits to assaulting women. Now his victims are coming forward. This man is unfit to be President #debate
.@HillaryClinton knows we need an economy that works for EVERYONE, not just those at the top. Check out her 5pt plan https://t.co/v9C9vJ5zhi
#Immigration strengthens families, our economy &amp; country. @HillaryClinton can fix the broken system. Here's how: https://t.co/osDugTYKq9
Supporting both #gunsafety and the #2ndAmendment is in the interest of the American people. They aren't mutually exclusive
The Senate has a duty to Americans to confirm the next @SCOTUSnom. @HillaryClinton will appoint justices who protect American ideals.

Tonight once again showed that @HillaryClinton is the woman for the job. Trump is racist, misogynistic , and woefully unprepared. #ImWithHer
Even prominent members of the #GOP are withdrawing their support from Trump. He's too dangerous to lead #debate https://t.co/vS0X09BV7G
#ClimateChange is real &amp; people's lives are already impacted. We can't afford a candidate who ignores the proof https://t.co/kEVOs81DKm
We have lost too many to #gunviolence across this country. @HillaryClinton understands the need to end the epidemic https://t.co/oLxEZbqsx9
No one has the right to make decisions about a woman's body. A woman's health is between her and her doctor #debate
None of our children should be made to feel bad about who they are. That's one of the many reasons why #ImWithHer https://t.co/d7eOnXwpuc
If Trump gets so rattled just answering questions, how can we trust him to handle the stress of the Presidency? We cant. #ImWithHer #debate
Trump can strengthen our economy by paying taxes @HillaryClinton will stop people like Trump from gaming the system https://t.co/30f0JOgYiq
.@HillaryClinton is who I trust to keep our country safe. She has years of experience as SecState. Trump is far too volatile to lead #debate
We need affordable healthcare #Trump will repeal Obamacare &amp; take coverage from millions @HillaryClinton will fix it https://t.co/TOSgdGIkTQ
The #TrumpTapes are simply deplorable. How can a man with daughters can speak about women like that? We need support not assault #ImWithHer

.@HillaryClinton has a real plan to work w/ our global allies to take down terror networks like ISIS and make us safer at home. #debate
.@HillaryClinton's experiences as FLOTUS, NYS Sen &amp; Sec of State make her uniquely qualified and prepared to be our next POTUS #debatenight
#GunSafety reforms must be a top priority -- there have been far too many Orlandos and Sandy Hooks #EnoughIsEnough, which is why #ImWithHer
#ImWithHer because @HillaryClinton knows that when we build an economy that works for all, America is stronger #Debates2016
It's time for our businesses and and paychecks to reflect that #equalmeansequal. We are past due for #equalpayforequalwork. #ImWithHer
Great being with @KathyHochul  as we wait for tonight’s debate to start. We both proudly stand with @HillaryClinton and say   #ImWithHer! https://t.co/j9aDbil6Gd

Fact Check on #Trump  #RNCinCLE speech - crime rate in US actually near historic lows. https://t.co/crhe9zH4uM
