At #WatermarkConf I chatted with @WhitWolfeHerd about women in the workplace. Did you know 1 in 3 women feel like they have to hide their emotions to be taken seriously at work? Let’s commit to supporting each other and asking for support we need to be our best selves at work. https://t.co/oHllhAg42Z
@alexisohanian @OlympiaOhanian Awwwwwww love you so much.
I asked @alexisohanian if waited for the shower water to get warm before he met me.... he said no 🧐
I don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day so it was nice to have a girls day. Having @alexisohanian be supportive and understand is one of a kind. I’m so fortunate for him to get it and respect my beliefs. https://t.co/36p887WKEX

This year is to you! What are some things you had to do while working? #thismama #thisdaddy
So if it means warming up and stretching while holding my baby that’s what #thismama will do. My fellow moms and dads working- or stay home it’s equally as intense- but you inspire me. Hearing your stories makes me know I can do this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. https://t.co/dCxzvedVBi
As I head into next year it’s not about what we can do it’s what we MUST do as working moms and working dads. Anything is possible. I am getting ready for the first match of the year and my dear sweet baby @olympiaohanian was tired and sad and simply needed mama’s love. https://t.co/1fdzV1bHSa

#thismama gets stressed out a lot when Olympia does not sleep.... I’m currently stressed.
Everynight she goes to sleep I think about her and watch videos all night until I fall asleep. #thismama is a bit obsessed. Tell me I’m not the only one.
Olympia had her one year check up and she has been super clingy ever since #thismama wants to know if this is normal? I mean I kinda liked it she wanted to be by my side ALLLL day but she cried whenever I left her even just to go to the bathroom.
I had a great time at @The_Greenbrier this past weekend. Thank you to all of the fans who came out to show your support! https://t.co/2edlClMjch
One year check up today for @OlympiaOhanian I am excited to see how she’s grown...

@yakuzaamdo I literally thought of that!!!
But I’m ready to do whatever it takes to have a clean sport so bring it on. I’m excited.
...and it’s that time of the day to get “randomly” drug tested and only test Serena. Out of all the players it’s been proven I’m the one getting tested the most. Discrimination? I think so. At least I’ll be keeping the sport clean #StayPositive

Never stop believing in yourself. You’re worth it. https://t.co/8lzFQeDcD2
Today, I am excited to introduce @ShopSerena, my own online shop: https://t.co/4tHKDgNgX9 https://t.co/uoY0EvurBz
23 Grand Slam titles later, I assembled my power team and we got to work. We designed and we planned. I wanted to be fully hands on, and work without any limitations. Everyone on the team believed in me and for the first time, I truly believed in myself.
Here I was, a spokeswoman for women, telling them to never give up and believe in themselves when no one else does. I needed to take a moment to look in the mirror and encourage myself and invest in myself for once.
One day, I was encouraging my best friend to invest in herself and pursue a dream of hers. A light bulb went off when I realized I needed to take my own advice.
15 years of false starts and people telling me “no” was frustrating, but also made me more determined. If you know anything about me, you know that when someone tells me “no,” it only makes me work harder.
Every time I would go into a department store to present a collection it would always end up with - we love it but we are going to pass...
I tried many times to align with people who could help me get things off the ground while I played tennis worked with designers and sketched my ideas. I got so many no’s from potential partners, people I admired and respected.
That was 2001. I had a vision to create a fashion line unrelated to tennis, but soon realized the complexities of manufacturing and running a business was more than my schedule would allow, as I focused on winning Grand Slams.
They say life is about timing. I learned this lesson at age 18, when I chose to play a light tennis schedule because I wanted to go to fashion school. Some criticized my decision, but I knew I had two loves--tennis and fashion--and had to find a way to make them coexist.
Catsuit anyone? For all the moms out there who had a tough recovery from pregnancy—here you go. If I can do it, so can you. Love you all!! https://t.co/xXb3BKDGNF

@visonsofgideonn Ok this one makes the most sense. Thanks! So the animals already knew how to bend?? Interesting 🤔🤔
@scotty_13_ BUT- remember a lot of the people left the lion turtles with bending powers. They decided to live off the turtles and make a life for them like Wan did... the sea turtles gave them all powers... ? I'm really confused
@dinethuw_811 Hummmm but so...  the humans had it first???
Avatar last air bender fans only: Question- If the original benders were the sky bisons, badger moles, and dragons; how does that tie in with Avatar Wan when the lion sea turtle gave all the people bending power?????
