Drama couldn‚Äôt be higher right now. Anchoring #insidepolitics starting soon. 12 n et /9 a p. Tune in @CNN
I‚Äôm told as of this morning Jeff Flake was still making calls to friends and confidantes - weighing the issues surrounding #Kavanaugh
I‚Äôm told @SenatorCollins is expected to vote yes on cloture this am. Will likely announce how she will vote on final confirmation during 3p senate floor speech. #kavanaugh
In the chair for #insidepolitics on @cnn on this pivotal day. Lots of new developments on #kavanaugh nomination. Tune in 12n et 9a pt.
Senate sources tell me and @mkraju that senators will start reading the FBI investigation summaries on Kavanaugh tomorrow (Thursday)
Talked to @NancyPelosi at the @TheAtlanticFest today. Check it out. https://t.co/fnHF0c8Q5L
On senate floor @senatemajldr is cleverly focusing on Dems re Kavanaugh. Right now it‚Äôs all about 3 of his fellow Republicans. He seems to be trying to get their GOP constituents to cry foul. Unclear it would sway any of them.
Icymi with all the drama Friday. @eliselabottcnn interviewed @netanyahu  https://t.co/Iav7FVVSEi
CNN Photog Dave Burgess and @SuzanneMalveaux were the ones who captured Jeff Flakes elevator moment. Here is Suzanne‚Äôs behind the scenes   https://t.co/CRINEziWdL
From @SenatorCollins spox Annie Clark: ‚ÄúSen. Susan Collins was consulted about the White House authorizing the expanded FBI approach to the Kavanaugh background check and it is her understanding that the work will still be completed in the original one week timeline. ‚Äú
More: sources familiar w key gop senators thinking tell me their intention was NOT to limit the investigation. I‚Äôm also told the senators have called the wh over the past 24-48 hours to make that clear. As a result @Acosta reports the WH told FBI it is NOT limited. https://t.co/W8ovT8BjRL
GOP senator tells me that @senatemajldr told WH Friday the 3 key GOP Senators wanted the FBI to interview 4 people: PJ Smyth, Leland Keyser, Mark Judge &amp; Deborah Ramirez. Senator tells me with that limit - FBI could be done by today or Tuesday #Kavanaugh
‚ÄúI'm not a drinker.I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life. It's one of my only good traits...I never had a glass of alcohol. I never had alcohol, for whatever reason...Can you imagine if I had? What a mess I would be. I would be the world's worst. I never drank, okay?"

Serious q - Is Rachel Mitchell still there ?
Kavanaugh tactic to ask senators questions back at them. Never seen that before
Wait - what happened to Rachel Mitchell doing the questioning for he GOP? Is she still there ?
Me thinks @LindseyGrahamSC saw @DickDurbin score points on FBI investigation q with #Kavanaugh and he jumped in and went nuts to change the hearing dynamic. And he did. Side note: Graham and Durbin work closely together on immigration and other issues.

You would think @realDonaldTrump wanted Rosenstein out right away after NYT story on taping POTUS/25 amendment. But several sources say POTUS had been convinced to stay calm by GOP friends/Fox hosts arguing its a set up
Another dynamic re rosenstein: source familiar w all this tells me there was real pressure to have rosenstein testify under oath this week before congress - come before Judiciary cmte to state what he did or did not say.

McConnell made clear to @Phil_Mattingly that he isn‚Äôt ready to support @OrrinHatch call to cease separating families until congress acts. Didn‚Äôt say no. But didn‚Äôt say yes
Consensus out of GOP Senate lunch appears to be a desire to fix the child separation issue legislatively. Open question is whether it is narrow and targeted enough to get Dems on board. They are dubious.

That is one of @mike_pence best arguments - he was fighting Bush spending and govt programs while in Congress before it was cool.
Trump has been speaking for 23 minutes. Where's @mike_pence ? #freemikepence

@DavidMDrucker you're a funny guy
Sources: Trump and pence spoke late last night -- leaned into picking pence. That and more coming up on @CNN
