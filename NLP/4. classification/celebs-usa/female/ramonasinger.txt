All the naysayers should post there own pictures instead of hiding behind blank photos
Yes I answer my fans.
@kbaum1977 yes I do actually and so does the doctor.  But how would you know you have a cartoon for your picture.
@thomasemckinney back up
@notstrimeni oh didn't know there are rules to hashtags.  Your wrong
@animallovr2 go read my blog on my website it's all there https://t.co/gFsYnaC6wI
@katiev629 no.  Statistics say 30 % are genes. Rest is skincare routine and if I choose to do elective procedures that's my choice
@animallovr2 just because I am on a show it's not necessary to be rude when someone doesn't know me personally and are judging from Tv
@freedommustbe so don't listen
@Sherry37945727 you made the rules ?
@bucarobaby84 yes I am.  So what ?

@Brysbabydoll I don't turn. Actually recap. Bethenny has a victim per season.  Last year Luann once Heather Jill Kristen Kelly
Why is okay for bethenny to dish it out always anyway she wants ? No one else can?
Okay maybe not my best delivery

@JohnnyBarrToons it was meant to be ... was looking for a reaction as I was hurt she never told me
@briggie_smaIIs @WhatCrappens @DorindaMedley I invited first
@CaroleRadziwill @Andy btw Carole.  Not a good comparison knowing about raising a #kid or knowing about #politics.  I mean really
@CaroleRadziwill @Andy actually we may not agree on politics but that has nothing at all to do with #KNOWLEDGE
I do have a #heart. That has nothing to do with still using #countess
@CountessLuann how come your handle in twitter is still#countess your not a #countess anymore.

@judo4me this is true
@jan_purcell  it was a rough night #rhony
@realrealitysis @DorindaMedley that's why she was so hurt
@CandidKristal thanks for that
It's good at least the three of us ended in laughter #rhony @DorindaMedley @bethenny
I hurt Dorinda so much it's hard for me to relive this
That's what @bethenny was trying to express  https://t.co/9m73hWo1D8
Is it just me or is John smirking  #rhony
Wow now we @Bethenny and I are witches ? !?
@_AllysonMarie_ john has never been married and me 23 yrs
Omg john is saying things I can't believe to Dorinda
@bravoholclique all good thx.
@RanonaRyder @DorindaMedley @Bethenny that's a valid point
The texts I got from Dorinda broke my heart and made me so sad
It's amazing how little you get in nyc for such big money
I #Ramona knows john loves Dorinda   but is it a healthy #relationship
Who else is shocked as #ramona
I never heard the f word so often in a conversation
Omg I #ramona am so glad I wasn't there when john showed up !!
