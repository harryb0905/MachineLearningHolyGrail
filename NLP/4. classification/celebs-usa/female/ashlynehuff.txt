...it's very Twilight-esque, only I wrote it before I ever knew what Twilight was!
I'll put that on my to-do list. Truthfully, THAT is my favorite, but I wasn't sure I had shown you guys yet!!
Did I ever show you "I'm Alive"?
"sweet nothing" and "heartbeat"....just because they were so personal and I remember everything about the day I wrote them.
i love that everyone has such different answers. THIS is why I try to make music that is different from even itself! :) Mine is probably...
So... question: what's your FAVORITE song of mine. First or second album. :)
