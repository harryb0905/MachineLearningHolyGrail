@KatzOnEarth @EbolaPhone so again to US, WHO etc: why wait? it's getting worse by the day. it's been 7 months. get the proper supplies there
@KatzOnEarth @EbolaPhone Unclear - they use the word "committed" &amp; add that DoD its prepared to devote more than $1 billion to contain it.
.@EbolaPhone US has spent 400+mil. Gates donated 50mil, Zuckerberg 25mil. All I'm asking is why these BASIC supplies have yet to be provided

@The_CoachBA did you see the vid? Rice punched his then fiancé out, then dragged her knocked-out body from elevator. She couldn't walk away.
I don't get why society often gets more upset by abuse of animals, than abuse of people. The @RayRice27 vid makes my stomach curl. Not okay.
Lump in my throat thinking of the heartbreak @MelRivers feels right now. As Joan rests in peace, let's all send some loving energy Mel's way
@bullystyle311 @RubinReport she did not. but apparently she does color her hair at home. 💆💇👯  #dyes not #dies

@bendreyfuss well yes, they'd have to request &amp; doctors would decide if they qualify for that option just like you have other treatments
@bendreyfuss controversial but if I had a child or parent in constant pain w/ no relief &amp; no way to cure them, I would prob want this choice

@_moseph @BertShowBert yep, strange. hpv is common sexually spread virus &amp; has no symptoms! often leads to cancer in men &amp; women. #vaccinate
@BertShowBert yes! cdc recommends boys/girls age 11-26 get hpv vaccine. And it works best if they get 3 doses before they're sexually active
@EvanTrowbridge so good!

@AntDeRosa considering obamacare goes into place tmrw, i would argue that it is breaking news for consumers trying to make sense of it all.
@AntDeRosa for majority of consumers it is. it's a big part of the disagreement &amp; the fact that govt shutdown wouldnt stop it is significant
NEW: Senate passed by unanimous consent a bill that would ensure the #military is paid if there is a #government shutdown.
DEAR WASHINGTON:  "Poll: Just 10% of Americans say they approve of the job Congress is doing, an all-time low in a CNN survey"
*Regardless of a Govt shutdown, #uninsured Americans will still be able to sign up for insurance tmrw. Marketplace funded by mandatory funds

@fredonair @NettoNeves you're correct. it isn't going to end their civil war but the point is to send message that chem weapon use is not ok
@NettoNeves @fredonair I think something should be done to stop use of chem weapons (which are a threat not just to syria but whole world).
.@fredonair not advocating. i'm educating on what some of the innocent people killed in #syria experienced. they deserve the world to know.
SARIN GAS 101: odorless,colorless. u breathe in, then vision blurs, convulsions start &amp; most end up suffocating. horrific way to die. #syria
@Mehdi_Moose @bobatl yes, there is evidence. you just heard the Pres. also, google vids posted of the attacks &amp; see for yourself. horrific.
@bobatl innocent women/kids r being gassed to death. chemical weapons cause them to convulse &amp; it eventually suffocates them. is that okay?
Ouch. “@NickKristof: Now members of Congress will have to consult maps and figure out where Syria is.”

@lengeiger @NeverDauntedNet I was responding to @Sanlin's insult to me, not your tweet.
@Koreelove we discuss that in the documentary tonight
.@Sanlin @lengeiger ok. u apparently are the expert! and likely will not watch tonite or do your own research, but throw stones anyway. nice
.@Sanlin that's why we spent a year investigating the doc. watch it 8p &amp; tweet q's to @drsanjaygupta. he'll be responding in real time.#weed
@JamieReidy and again, we're talking about medical marijuana. there are benefits to #weed w/ fewer side effects that other drugs on market
@fordvox we get into that in the documentary tonight.
.@Sanlin @lengeiger watch the documentary &amp; learn the facts. 8p ET. someone dies every 19 mins from rx drug overdose. do u care bout that?!
the dea classifies #marijuana in same drug class as cocaine &amp; meth. yet we could't find one documented case of someone overdosing from #weed
@RoryCordial we've been mislead for yrs to think #weed isn't beneficial. not only can it help patients, but it's often only thing that works
. @lengeiger people often just assume that we're talking about smoking #weed.... but med marijuana comes in various forms (oils, foods etc)
Forget everything you thought you knew about #WEED. Then watch @DrSanjayGupta's new doc 8p ET @CNN &amp; live tweet with Sanjay during the show!

@Senain it was cold! like if you went outside w/ no clothes on during a Chicago winter. BUT..it only lasts 3 mins so its tolerable
@discomaulvi roughly $60 u.s. dollars per session.
@seanpfahey wasn't my core body temp -- but your skin temp. basically like when athletes go in an ice bath after an injury.
@purtheil it is suppose to help with inflammation, muscle recovery, and natural energy boost. similar to athletes in  an ice bath
@seanpfahey yep
@NorCalDan714 you stand in a small chamber, and wear socks and gloves only to prevent frostbite of fingers/toes. it only lasts 3 mins
@discomaulvi it is suppose to release endorphins and cause your blood to rush to areas your body needs repaired (like inflammation).
@DrAndyBaldwin it doesn't change core temp, but skin temp. it is suppose to trigger endorphins and blood flow. it's similar to ice immersion
@isabellchen I just tried it to see what it was like. But people use it to lower inflammation in body (sports/arthritis), &amp; for energy boost
just tried "cryo-therapy" - basically you get cooled w/ gas nitrogen for 3 mins to drop body temp. mine dropped to 45 degrees! it was cool.

@HobbyHumor1 it is not ok to #bully, #obsess &amp; #lie about her, but it's ur decision. sad life. but don't do it in disguise. own ur actions.
@HobbyHumor1 u didn't break anything. u listened non-stop to TBS and guessed on her being preggo (like others when they heard she had news)

@HobbyHumor1 oh boy. u r REALLY bad at guessing! u got the wrong friend's house. try again? (bet it kills u that u actually have zero intel)
@HobbyHumor1 wish u had courage to #bully w/o being anonymous. Instead u spend ur day digitally stalking &amp; pretending to b the person u hate
@HobbyHumor1 @crs19 it really wasn't at her house. so your 'source' must have gone and planted you wrong info again.  sounds like a trend!
@CRS19 u make comments based on ur opinion. Fine. Free speech. But @hobbyhumor1 spreads lies, has no real scoops. It's a boy!No it's a girl!
@HobbyHumor1 breaking news: it is apparently a heinous crime to have a baby shower where ppl give u gifts (gasp!). Seriously? C'mon. #bully
@HobbyHumor1 @crs19 good guess based off the photo 'clue' but ur wrong. and if u actually knew anyone close to Jenn u'd know the real answer

@FatOnTheOutside ha! well they are definitely not all besties.
I don't know why but I expected the celebs to interact w/ each other during commercial break. But most are keeping to themselves. #GRAMMYS
@linfunk well everyone was already standing up for his performance. so technically doesn't count :)
Adele's "rolling in the deep" performance from #Grammys two year's ago is playing during this commercial break. Plus arena lit up for photos
So far, the only performance to get a standing ovation from the floor was FUN. #grammys
