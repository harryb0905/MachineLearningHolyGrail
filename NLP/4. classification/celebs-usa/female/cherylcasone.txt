@Piglettfarms @kefincognito @NOBSZONE @TuckerCarlson @united @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir @Delta @NOBSZONE I agree overbooking is horrendous @southwest stopping
@Piglettfarms @kefincognito @NOBSZONE @TuckerCarlson @united @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir @Delta I think Delta assumed lap child so no. Older son wasn't there so man didn't have rights to seat
@ronniespapa Southwest but yes I did
@sgtbetsysmith @cvpayne @FoxBusiness I would hope but don't think so
My take on @delta @americanair @united incidents "Skies not-so-friendly anymore: Is it all airlines' fault? https://t.co/DSZxKlAuHE
@SidneyLeeKing1 it was once a glamorous career and to your point (still) dangerous.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule You can buy as many tix as you want, they'll take your $$$!
@ge2229617 @MarkSteynOnline @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews good one
@FLMarEng @united @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir @Delta Not true 1000's of flights daily w/ good service.
@tahoeskiqueen @FLMarEng @united @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir @Delta That's all you have they are "ugly"? F/A tough job w/ weeks of FAA testing.
@BobbyM62 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @MarkSteynOnline don't disagree but flying still safest way to travel
@informedblackmn @AlaskaAir Not yet, but passengers have phones ready for ANY issue so they can sue/15 seconds fame
Child was technically a "lap child" the seat wasn't bought in his name. https://t.co/K5feYdeX8p
