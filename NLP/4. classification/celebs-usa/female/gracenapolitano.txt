H.R. 1139 aims to prevent assaults, increase public safety by eliminating blind spots, and provide additional upgrades to the transportation systems in the SGV and nationwide. Transit workers take very seriously their jobs to ensure our safety; it is time we prioritize theirs.
On Tuesday I visited the El Monte Bus Station and met with @metrolosangeles officials and operators. Appreciated our discussion on bus safety, which included the Transit Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act (H.R. 1139), bipartisan legislation I introduced last week. https://t.co/2mwhciH5q2
We must understand that their voices matter and that civic participation is important no matter what age you may be.
I was glad to answer questions from 7th and 8th graders, and I am encouraged to see their interest in government. Young people’s concerns are too often ignored by elected officials because they do not vote.
After receiving an inquiry by a student who dreams of one day being a member of Congress/engineer, I spent this morning with that youngster and other students at St. Louis of France School in La Puente. https://t.co/X1W1hqO8xO
Proud to cosponsor this resolution to terminate Trump’s unlawful #FakeEmergency declaration. https://t.co/wAEc4XFi0V
Trump is creating an emergency where none exists! It’s unconstitutional, irresponsible, and sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations and our democracy. #FakeTrumpEmergency
Voted tonight to keep the government open. I commend the bipartisan House &amp; Senate conferees who reached this agreement and urge the President to sign it. https://t.co/bn4mBsI7IL
We owe it to them and all communities who have been shattered by gun violence in America to continue fighting to prevent tragedies and save lives. #MSDstrong #NeverForget
Since that tragedy, we have seen incredible resilience and determination from the victims’ families and surviving students.

Spoke this morning on the importance of funding suicide prevention research and treatments. As we fight to reduce stigma, we must consider all possible ways to stop suicide and save lives. https://t.co/CPo2rQmLJ4
I strongly condemn the recent anti-Semitic comments made by Rep. Omar. Such stereotypes are dangerous, offensive, and fuel propaganda efforts by white supremacists. We must always call out and stand united against anti-Semitism in all forms.
I thank @RepJohnKatko for his continued partnership, and I am grateful to all of our colleagues for joining in support of this critical legislation.
Improved access to services for prevention, early identification, and intervention has helped countless youth in our communities thrive in school, at home, and in life, and it is a model that should be expanded to serve families across America.
The Mental Health Services for Students Act builds on the great success of our youth suicide prevention program in LA County, where we are raising #mentalhealth awareness, reducing harmful #stigma, and connecting our future leaders to life-saving care. https://t.co/U18IOUfpnf
John Dingell was a giant of a man who was as gentle as can be. It was a true privilege serving alongside him, fighting for American families. Through his illness he continued to smile and warm our hearts. Sending all my love to Debbie Dingell and the entire Dingell family

Now a U.S. citizen, Isaac draws hope from his own immigrant experience, as he looks toward future generations and endeavors to carry out Archbishop Gomez’s vision of humane immigration reform.
Through his vocation, he witnesses firsthand the harm this administration’s failed immigration policies have inflicted on our communities and recognizes the need for fair, compassionate solutions that respect human dignity and the rule of law.
My #SOTU guest, Isaac Cuevas of Duarte, works for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on immigration issues and is an immigrant himself. He came to this country with his parents from Mexico at age 2, thanks to President Reagan, and his story is #OurHispanicSOTU. https://t.co/ogrgPSUZjH

The gender wage gap affects women of color in the US most severely. Passing the #PaycheckFairness Act would mean more $ for necessities like groceries, rent, child care &amp; education. #Ledbetter10 @HouseDemWomen
It's well past time for the #PaycheckFairness Act, which would help break harmful patterns of pay discrimination. The public overwhelmingly supports it and women &amp; their families cannot afford to wait! #Ledbetter10 @HouseDemWomen
The proposed rule would effectively strip crucial medicines of their protected status. If patients are unable to obtain the medicines they need, many will experience avoidable complications that could reduce their quality of life. We must protect these beneficiaries &amp; their care.
Last wk @RepJohnKatko &amp; I sent a letter urging Sec. Azar to not finalize the proposed rule to change Medicare Part D’s Six Protected Classes policy, which ensures access to lifesaving medicines for beneficiaries living w/ mental illness,cancer,organ transplants,epilepsy,HIV/AIDS https://t.co/vFa6L1rA6B

Countless lives disrupted, natl security put at risk, public health &amp; safety threatened, and economy weakened are some of the completely needless consequences of Trump’s 35-day tantrum. Unconscionable. We must put an end to this governing by crisis once and for all.

I have spoken with from federal workers in my district who just want the respect they deserve. It is unfair to them and nearly 40,000 other federal employees in California. Let’s get the government open so people can get paid and get on with their lives. #EndTheShutdown
Congress provided billions of dollars to help people in California, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida, etc. rebuild their lives and prepare them for future disasters, not a slush fund to be raided by this President to fulfill his campaign promise. https://t.co/iquIKjz7C0

As Trump continues to hold hostage the paychecks of 800k federal employees, he is now threatening to cut off FEMA $ for wildfires in CA, a slap in the face to thousands of families devastated. Real people are suffering the consequences of his childish tantrum. It must end now!
Ensuring bipartisan background checks on gun sales &amp; transfers is the most effective &amp; efficient way to begin to #EndGunViolence in America and start saving lives. We need to pass #HR8 immediately! #NeverAgain
Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence, ripping apart countless cities and communities. This is not a pattern; it is an epidemic. Congress must act, pass #HR8, and do all we can to prevent these tragedies from occurring. #NeverAgain

I agree w/ @CBP Commissioner McAleenan, we absolutely need to budget for medical &amp; mental health care for children in these facilities. The Trump administration should also bring back the successful/cost-effective Family Case Management Program and stop detaining families.

These actions are inhumane and unjustifiable. https://t.co/HSmkHd4wzf
Instead, Americans have seen chaos and cruelty at the border: children forcibly separated from their parents and detained for months, migrants seeking refuge from persecution being barred entry, ports of entry shuttered, and tear gas used against women and children.

These tragedies will remain a scourge in our nation until we pass meaningful solutions to prevent them. We must turn our grief into action and finally work together to stop gun violence.
Wounds inflicted by gun violence are not just physical but psychological. Counseling &amp; mental health services must be made available to all survivors, first responders, and all in need. If you or someone you know needs help, call SAMHSA Disaster Distress Helpline: 1-800-985-5990
We pray for the recovery of those injured and send our deepest sympathies to all of the families, colleges, and communities impacted. Thank you to all of the first responders for their brave actions in the face of peril.

This latest ploy to sabotage the ACA would raise out-of-pocket costs and be devastating to millions of working families.
Short-term health plans 1) Are not required to cover the ACA’s essential health benefits, such as life-saving mental health services, and 2) Discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, like asthma, pregnancy, or a previous cancer diagnosis. https://t.co/Ih3xQpi3b9

In six decades of service to our country, Senator John McCain was a hero and living example that we can achieve so much more when we work together instead of against each other. I join the millions of grateful Americans in sending my deepest condolences to his family.
However, it is critical that we continue to work with other states and business leaders to prioritize public health and our planet’s future over polluters and corporate profits.
California by contrast is working to combat climate change by lowering our carbon emissions, increasing our renewable energy production, and creating a drought-proof, sustainable water portfolio.
The expected rule and its increased emissions of carbon dioxide will affect human health all across the country and globe. Today’s announcement further shows this administration’s absence when it comes to mitigating the catastrophic impacts of climate change.
It is infuriating that President Trump is again siding with coal-burning states and coal lobbyists over the health and safety of all Americans. It does not take a scientist to understand that pollution does not follow state boundaries. https://t.co/MzYaFG4TXN

HAPPENING NOW: Joining my @HispanicCaucus colleagues reacting to our meeting with DHS Sec. Nielsen. We continue to demand answers &amp; accountability for this crisis the Trump admin created and has yet to resolve. https://t.co/sceEh1GeQF #EndFamilyDetention #KeepFamiliesTogether
Should a quality degree come with a mountain of student debt? We don’t think so, either. That's why House Democrats are introducing the #AimHigher Act: Giving every student the opportunity to earn a debt-free degree. https://t.co/WDAcmfNYLH https://t.co/EVqR9wWktz
The @USProgressives #PeoplesBudget reverses Trump’s harmful cuts &amp; fixes a system that for far too long has only benefited those at the top. Proud to support this budget to build an economy that creates good-paying jobs &amp; invests in hardworking families! https://t.co/eKwaQEF9p4
We will continue to demand full accountability of the admin, conduct additional oversight visitations of facilities, call for reinstatement of the family case management program &amp; advocate for other humane alternatives to family detention.#KeepFamiliesTogether #EndFamilyDetention
While the administration completed all eligible reunifications of children up to age 5 by July 12, it now has until this Thursday to meet the court-ordered July 26 deadline for reuniting 5 to 17 year-olds. #KeepFamiliesTogether
We do not yet know the long-term impact of these traumatic separations, but it is our obligation to mitigate harm already inflicted and ensure it never happens again. The crisis of the Trump administration’s own making is far from resolved.  #KeepFamiliesTogether
Fact is, though, very few children are receiving this level of care &amp; treatment. Immigrant youth detained near the border as a result of Trump admin’s cruel policy of separating families have been subject to harsh living conditions, causing additional trauma.#KeepFamiliesTogether
We went to ensure all children were receiving the critical services, incl. mental health evaluations &amp; trauma-informed care, mandated to them in accordance with California’s child welfare law. Services administered there go above &amp; beyond our expectations. #KeepFamiliesTogether
On Saturday, @RepJudyChu, @RepMarkTakano, @CongressmanRuiz &amp; I visited an Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)-funded facility in LA County, which houses unaccompanied immigrant children who have been separated from their parents. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/HgJxA9YNVD
The Trump admin's decision to add a citizenship question to the #2020Census will have long-lasting consequences, jeopardizing the distribution of federal $ to CA’s cities for our schools/roads/police &amp; fire protection/other critical govt services our communities rely on daily.
President Trump has said that women should face “punishment” for exercising their constitutional right to abortion. Now, with Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, this nightmare could become a reality. We must #StopKavanaugh &amp; protect women’s right to choose! #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/hAFNXyiRd7
A11.2 It is not illegal to seek refuge in the US, and this administration should not punish families that try to protect their children from violence and harm #KeepFamiliesTogether #EarlyEdChat
A11 Americans should not have to choose between keeping families together and securing our border. #KeepFamiliesTogether #EarlyEdChat
Trump has an agenda, and his #SCOTUS nominee is a dangerous choice. Women’s freedom, voting rights and civil rights are all at risk. #StopKavanaugh #OurVoteOurVoice
170 years ago, July 1848, women at the Seneca Falls Convention pledged to fight for women’s right to vote. Today in 2018, we continue to fight for our voice and our rights. #OurRightsOurVote https://t.co/oahSQlT7LH

President Trump’s trip abroad has been an utter embarrassment for our country. We call on Republicans to join us in standing up for our country, our democratic values &amp; our citizens.

Americans should not have to choose between keeping families together and securing our border. Time to revive the Family Case Management program the Trump administration ended in 2017, which had 100% compliance rates. #ProtectFamilies #EndFamilyDetention https://t.co/oTaEznxWY1
.@AmerAcadPeds agrees that family detention is not the solution to address the forced separation of families at our country’s southern border. #ProtectFamilies #EndFamilyDetention

The Affordable Care Act guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, which more than half of all women &amp; girls have. They could lose health care coverage if those protections are invalidated by a Supreme Court ruling. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/svQnAoCiBn
This is what happens when you separate kids from their parents &amp; force a 1-yr-old to stand before a judge.“The judge at the Phoenix courthouse said he was "embarrassed to ask" if the defendant understood the proceedings.”#ProtectFamilies #ImmigrationCourt https://t.co/ELREYSaWWU
This Supreme Court vacancy should not be used as a political weapon. #RoeVWade is legal precedent. It has been law for 45 years, protecting women’s essential right to control their own bodies. We know #WhatsAtStake here – women’s freedom and equality.
The next administrator must be focused on our responsibility to future generations, incorporating the concerns of Native Americans into decisions regarding development and resource management.
Administrator Pruitt’s resignation is welcome, but long overdue. We hope his replacement will be more concerned about the important issues affecting the American people, such as clean drinking water, clear skies, and protecting our nation’s natural beauty. https://t.co/TINHjETP6E

We are disappointed by today’s ruling, but we are not defeated. We will continue fighting for policies that empower hardworking families and protect the unions who support them. #Union #UnionStrong https://t.co/LylfwVzAf3
Teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other union workers earn higher pay and have better access to medical care, retirement benefits, and paid leave than non-unionized workers.
It is an unprecedented attack on the labor movement, which has helped bring countless individuals out of poverty, expanded the middle class, and strengthened our communities and economy.
In siding with corporations over people, #SCOTUS is undercutting the freedom of all public service workers to negotiate for decent pay and safe, fair workplaces. #Union #UnionStrong https://t.co/uAwe3Cge6e
On this #LGBTEqualityDay, we celebrate the historic decisions that have been made on this date and vow to continue fighting for equal protection under the law. #Pride2018 https://t.co/DGteaqNqTV
#NetNeutrality protects small businesses and innovators in our district by ensuring they have a level playing field online. The Trump @FCC’s repeal has gut those protections. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/lr1Cwd7ZsV
The ruling does not change the facts about President Trump, and it does not stop our fight against bigotry. We will continue working toward an America that unites families and seeks justice in every corner of society. #NoMuslimBanEver #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/f1NB4PYX53
Today's #SCOTUS decision to uphold Pres. Trump’s xenophobic Muslim Ban represents another shameful mark on our nation’s history. It undermines a core American value of religious freedom &amp; puts the religious liberty of ALL Americans at risk #NoMuslimBanEver https://t.co/FDdT9naZnM

Today I joined @RepDebDingell and more than 50 other women in the House in sending a letter demanding that the Trump Administration release details about the immigrant children and girls separated from their parents. #WhereAreTheGirls? https://t.co/WFpQmbrFHM
We call on the President to immediately end his administration’s zero tolerance policy, which has led to the prolonged detention of families, to decriminalize the asylum process, and to provide care, not harm, to asylum seekers or refugees.
Like family separation, family detention is traumatic and harmful to child development. Jails holding families will not abide by child welfare standards, depriving kids of mental health services and medical care. You cannot trade one form of child abuse for another.
Separating children from their parents is inhumane, but locking families up together is not the solution to the crisis which President Trump created. https://t.co/qjZGSvVXGZ
Children should not be ripped from the arms of their parents. Babies need to stay with their loving parents. The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct stops the #Trump administration’s government-sanctioned child abuse policy. #FamilesBelongTogether https://t.co/7iy7RW4oQG
The U.S. has long been a beacon of fairness &amp; safety, ensuring that children &amp; families fleeing oppression and hardship are treated with dignity and respect. On this #WorldRefugeeDay we reaffirm U.S. commitment that we will not abandon the world’s most vulnerable populations.
Separating children from their parents is inhumane, indefensible, and is a form of emotional violence. There is no justification for this cruelty, and it must end now. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/i76WvXzZoO
Today we commemorate the 6th anniversary of #DACA, recognizing the successes of the program &amp; all young Dreamers who continue to make positive contributions to our economy &amp; their communities. Proud to stand united w/ @HouseDemocrats in our fight to #ProtectDreamers. https://t.co/15cpC3pUbG

The Trump administration's practice of separating families is inhumane. We are not living up to the values that this country stands for, and it’s time that we made it clear that we will not tolerate any more of this abuse. #FamiliesBelongTogether #EndFamilySeparation https://t.co/f6r080EfOk

Mourning the innocent lives gunned down at Santa Fe High School today. We have failed in allowing these tragedies to become commonplace. Gun violence is ripping apart our communities. We have the power to change this. We must act to #EndGunViolence.
If the #GOPFarmBill becomes law, roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to school meals, &amp; more than 1M Americans would no longer receive benefits they rely on to buy food. As people of faith, we must be a voice for the voiceless. #ProtectSNAP

As #SCOTUS hears oral arguments in #Janus vs. AFSCME, important to remember this case was brought by billionaires to divide workers &amp; make it harder to stick together in unions. I stand w/ working people’s freedom to unite &amp; for good, union jobs. #UnRigTheEconomy #ItsAboutFreedom
Over the span of her career, the typical #AAPI woman loses at least $292,400 to the wage gap. In some states, the situation is much worse. We must end this injustice and close the wage gap. #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority https://t.co/WIYXaSn5gb
9 out of 10 suicides that involve a firearm end in death. For individuals in crisis, a #GVRO would temporarily remove weapons from their possession and mean the difference between taking their own life and seeking help. https://t.co/hN29W0C1OL
CA, CT, IN, WA &amp; OR have all adopted variations of the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act. They are saving lives without violating gun owners’ due process rights. We should expand them nationwide by passing the #GVRO Act https://t.co/LtY1MVZydq

Horrifying &amp; heart-breaking scene today in Parkland, FL. Gun violence has for the 18th time this year terrorized our schools. Praying for the victims &amp; every individual affected by this awful tragedy. We must #EndGunViolence. SAMHSA Disaster Distress Helpline: 1-800-985-5990 https://t.co/GhLskgiTFp
This #InfrastructurePlan is a sham, which amounts to a toll tax that San Gabriel Valley residents do not want and can ill afford. Our roads, bridges, and railroads are not for sale. https://t.co/CPn8nWRRcE https://t.co/DGkdCsSOU0
The economic case for passing the DREAM Act is strong. It is not just the right thing to do for our economy, though. It is the right thing to do, period. Yesterday was the 20th time @HouseDemocrats have asked for a vote to #ProtectDREAMers and the 20th time Republicans denied us. https://t.co/DUb27gLemD
No more delaying. No more inaction. Give us a vote! #GoNancyGo #ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/Ivff88XYAQ
America’s growing families need financial security when welcoming new children, whether it’s through birth, fostering or adoption. That’s what #paidleavemeans this #FMLA25.
It's time for paid family and medical leave in the United States. For everyone. Period. #paidleave #FMLA25 #PaidLeaveMeans
As we recognize #FMLA25, it’s unacceptable that still just 15% of workers have paid family leave through their employers. Real #paidleavemeans access for all working people.
It is clear that the rationale for authoring, declassifying, and ultimately releasing the memo was to discredit our nation’s top law enforcement officials and to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. #RemoveNunes https://t.co/HNLWNVfHD7 https://t.co/D2qKOShUeX
.@DevinNunes, @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP have proven they are willing to put President Trump’s interest above our national security interest &amp; discredit our country’s top law enforcement agency in the process. #RemoveNunes https://t.co/zpE4elJ73w

If President Trump is going to call for even an iota of private investment, then he needs to know we are not going to privatize our roads or public rail infrastructure. No more tolls; our roads are not for sale. Read more at: https://t.co/qrBqt6Ckq2 #SOTU

I voted NO on the 3-week government funding bill today because it provides no concrete solution to protect DREAMers—122 of whom lose their protections daily—and fails to meet the other critical needs of families in my district and across the country.
Republicans spent all their time &amp; votes on tax breaks for corporations &amp; the wealthiest. Now, they have no energy to pass children’s health, #ProtectDREAMers, or pass a budget. #TrumpShutdown
Rs in Congress &amp; President Trump have just closed the fed. govt. 1st time in our nation’s history a govt shutdown occurs while a single party controls the WH, Senate &amp; House of Reps.

Disgusting and inexcusable. The President’s racist comments have no place in America let alone in the White House. Our country has been a haven to the world’s persecuted. He has no conscience nor is he acting on behalf of millions of Americans. https://t.co/6okEGabnlZ
Judge Alsup’s decision is right one but no substitute for a lasting solution for #DREAMers. Congress must act urgently to provide certainty to #DREAMers and their families. #DreamActNow! https://t.co/g0Mbk1Stc5
Irresponsible and heartless. Not only will this decision upend the lives of nearly 200k Salvadoran immigrants who legally work and serve their communities, it will devastate the lives of more than 190k U.S. citizen children, ripping families apart.#SaveTPS https://t.co/HD8a99Hs1N
President Trump and Secretary Zinke are again siding with big oil and gas companies over the well-being of families and our planet. We reject these backwards fossil fuel-driven policies and must continue to invest in renewable energy sources.
Also, as we have seen too often, when spills occur, the companies leave and foot taxpayers with the bill to clean up the mess. It may be a new year, but this is the same old agenda.

@FAANews Trump’s plan gives airlines ability to fly where they want, when they want. Would have major impacts on airplane noise over SGV residences.
@FAANews Under Trump’s plan, airlines would have been able to decide routes without ANY input from public or oversight from reps. in Congress
@FAANews Govt-led process ensured new traffic routes did not negatively impact the San Gabriel Valley. #DontPrivatizeOurSkies
.@FAANews conducted process in SoCal to change flight routes to make air travel more efficient w/ sign-off from public &amp; Members of Congress
We cannot let corporations operate #ATC system &amp; risk cuts to workers’ pay &amp; benefits. #DontPrivatizeOurSkies
