Keith Williams, a gifted dancer, whose honesty and laughter I will remember always. You will be missed.
Her voice touched our hearts, and helped us to better understand ourselves. I will miss her.
Dr. Maya Angelou was truly inspirational. Her life, rich with experience - bad and good.
My brother, Michael, was, is and always will be a genius.  I love you, Mike. Janet

I truly valued the time that I was able to spend in his presence while at his home in Africa.
I am at a loss for words. Today, the world lost a great man and I lost a special friend, Nelson Mandela.
