Wait. I think I just lost my shit on twitter tonite just NOW. Sorry
@tomfriskey I did NOT lose my shit on twitter TONITE. I lost toDAY. The losing my shit on twitter TONITE will happen Thursday MORNING!!!!!!
Where ARE you guys?? This wedding is a BLAST! Carrie's brother's old wet DOG just met someone!!!! Get OVER here!!!!!
Billie here….don't tell Shattner. but I'm still getting mail from Babcock. Everyone's throwing meds at my mom now….This IS a happy ending...
MOM JUST GOT HOME!!!!!! She wants all of you to come to the wedding!!! But NOT to bring canned marshmallows or dog tongues……..
Wait……..no……it's Special POLICE FORCE rice…….cant imagine getting too much of that at THIS hour…….
What exactly IS special force rice? All the wedding guests are CRAZY for the stuff!!!!!!!
Why  everyone is throwing bats blood, meds &amp; dog tongue at Babcock &amp; Bill ? God, what's with all the canned marshmallows……….
Awwwww……This is such a happy ending to this story. ANY story! Could someone tell me why Babcock &amp; Bill (title of their new reality show BTW)
Billie here, my mom just got back from William Shattners nude wedding to Sargent Babcock. At least he won't be stalking ME anymore
Sorry……not badcock…..BABcock…..Christ some stalkers are so TOUCHY!
Man, who knew Shattner was such a big fan of Scream Queens? The show isn't even on yet! This is Billie, BTW, Thanks for the canned marshmall
Anyone here know how to sky write?
Fuck. Anyone know a Sargent Badcock? The guy has been pelting me with mail and sky writing AND canned goods!!!!!!!!
Hey guys, this is Billie Lourd, Carrie's daughter…. have you seen my mom? She just went down to answer the door saying something about Trek?
Hang on…..I think Shattner's at the door, he seems to be nude and screaming and covered in Gary's tongue…….
Sorry I was gone. Just giving some caned goods to the local shelter…..
Hey guys, thanks for covering for me. There's a note here from some cop for my daughter…..actually there are like 247 notes…whats going on?
Sargent Babcock here.NO, am NOT trying to stalk Ms Fisher's hot daughter, Billie. How DARE you impune me! I am on the police force! AND acid
Perhaps someone could locate Ms. Fisher's daughter &amp; she could tell us about this bat's blood……….
Could someone out there have suggested Ms. Fisher put her cell phone in her meds and cover it with bats blood?
We also have found a lot of Ms Fisher's meds. She might've taken SOME, but…...
Found some blood……could be human, dog or bat's…….can anyone help me with this? Sargent Babcock
At least the police force is with Carrie…..
Sargent Babcock here; we tried Mr. Shattner but he seemed to be nude &amp; screaming with some old wet dog…….
But there's a lot of rice, canned goods &amp; screaming. I know things are awkward w/ the police lately…..just thought in this case…….
My name is Sargent Babcock from the LAPD. Could someone tell me whats gone on here? Ms Fisher, her mother, her dog &amp; the force are missing
WAIT!!! The screaming just stopped!! And it turns out the CAT has gary's tongue--&amp; not my mother! Oh no! I hear footsteps…….HEEEEELLP
What happens if I get in the rice? AND its not the special force rice? AND Gary cant save me with his tongue? And my mom's screaming???
@silvermoon82 Checking behind my tweet for my phone. Heard screaming from there earlier…..
@ho3s_matthew Checking to see if the phone is in Gary, as per suggestion. Cant tell who's in the rice. Screaming the same with both sexes
@toddw Cant tell if power is off or on. Phone is dead, so off &amp; on died with it. So sad
@john_d_2017 I don't keep my plans for the death star in my phone anymore, thank Force. They got wet last time (but didn't drown)

And not care if you're ever found.
Just left the studio where Rufus Wainright sang some of his new album. He sounds like warm liquid twilight. Music you can get lost in.
I'm about to film my segment on Jimmy Fallon- my dressing room is like a whore house for boyscouts complete w/ cupcakes.
Might see Rufus Wainright tonight. He's in the studio recording. Hope to see him & his pal Justin Bond.

I finished my book the Verneys and now I'm reading the autobiography of Alice B Toklas. Not the most delicate looking woman.

I'm sleeping. I've asked that the Engineer to the Elsewheres post this discount opportunity to all my friends on Twitter.
sorry about swearing on the View. The bed-hopping thing threw me. I haven't screwed and told yet! Everyone is still alive-(ish).
@shadebee i think you should read the book afterward.

a complex task. since every audience is different, every show is different as well...
It takes all my energy not to change the show til the critics stop coming, so they can see a similar show-
I open Sunday & have critics coming to criticize me starting today til 5 days after.
Oy! I'm going to sleep... Two shows tomorrow. Bonne nuit d'amis.

@doobyus Really? Are you a happy person? Why would you say this? We hope you suck-seed in life. Cheers.
I  have my associate producer Garret text my messages, so forgive us or not for a typo here or there. Thank you.
This message is to the sanctimonious ones of you out there.
Things went better then expected. I followed Mariah Carey and Rabbi Shmuley. Showed my cleavage- implied tits. There's always next time.
Fully dressed & awake-ish for my interview on the Today show.
The name of the book I'm reading is a collection of essays by Michel de Montaigne. titled Montaigne
Goodnight moon.

I have to go to the gym now to loose a little weight so i can look like a thinner British rock icon like Bowie or Jagger. wish me luck.
@TheBwayLeague There's no understudy and when goes well it's your fault.
@TheBwayLeague all writing is rewriting
@TheBwayLeague No. Stage is more fun. Writing for stage is colloquial, keep it simple tell the truth writing pros can be a free for all
@kellereno I sweep the audience for mines and what you look for you inevitably find. where did @invariablyian get that shirt. It was AWESOME
@TheBwayLeague It was sort of nerve racking. I hate wearing high heels. I really enjoyed talking with Frank Langella back stage.
@jabrowner yes i'm working on another novel now. tentativly entitled "the Empire Strikes Wishful Drinking"
@scrapguyone not fully sure yet but Jane Fonda, Griffin Dunne, Salman Rushdie and my Mom said they come. so far
