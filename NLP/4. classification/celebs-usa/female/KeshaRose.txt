(9/10) I felt like now was the time to release it to further bring attention to this cause. We are all the same, born into whatever circumstance the universe hands us, and I believe it should be a right to be able to dream big.

(3/10) Even though DACA is scheduled to end, United We Dream has continued to fight for justice and dignity for immigrants and helps DREAMers apply for protection.  I am partnering up with United We Dream to shine a light on the organization,  and I wanted to encourage anyone
(2/10) They are working to protect and empower hundreds of thousands of DREAMers who came to this country as children and grew up, studied, and worked in the USA, and now face deportation with the scheduled end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
(1/10) When I attended the Time 100 Gala this past April, I met Cristina Jiménez, co-founder of the largest immigrant youth organization in the country, @UnitedWeDream.  I was so moved by what she and her team are doing to empower immigrant youth in our country. https://t.co/yGT5iN1IY0

I just feel the strength and awesomeness and power of being female. We hold the key to humanity. We decide if we populate the Earth, and if so, with whom. We could just decide not to have any more kids and the human race would be over. That is power.
I have earned the right call myself a motherfucking woman. I have always been a feminist, but for much of my life I felt like a little girl trying to figure things out. In the past few years, I have felt like a woman more than ever. https://t.co/e4vj5wYQ3W

this experience has changed my outlook and my life, i feel so lucky and blessed to have been so selflessly held up by these insanely talented women that deserved solo performances in their own right.
women empowering women is so much more beautiful than tearing each other apart.  that is part of the patriarchy that's gotta go. there is room and space for all women to succeed, and even help and support each other at the same time. https://t.co/KIIHQcoZXc

It’s important for me that people know that there are a lot of emotions on my new album Rainbow - but the wild fun energy that first inspired me to perform has not, and will never, go away. I'm still a motherfuckerrr.
To me, the thing I’m most proud of is that the song and video never lost the pure joy from the day it was birthed. I really hope people enjoy this song because I had the best time making it. I hope that energy passes through people and the fun is infectious.
Sometimes when things are so organic and visceral they just come together and this song and video are a product of that. I was going from dancing around and screaming to checking camera angles. I loved it.
Saundra Williams came down to Delaware to be part of the party. It was one of those projects where I knew exactly what I wanted and it was just easier to do it ourselves than try to explain my vision to another director.
We found a bar appropriately named the Oddity Bar and called upon my Creepies to emerge from their lairs (and my touring crew from their hibernation chambers) and we pulled the shoot together last minute.
For the video, my brother Lagan Sebert and I threw the shoot together in about a week and shot it while I was on tour in Delaware.
I was honored to work with Saundra Williams, who spent years singing with the legendary Sharon Jones in addition to being an amazing artist herself, on the background vocals as well as the Dap-Kings horns and it took the track to a whole other realm.
The vibes are real in between those walls and a thick layer of soul seems to cover everything in those rooms and it bleeds into the music.It felt like recording in another era - like how I imagined my heroes recording in the 1960s and Seventies.
It was such an experience to come into their world and see the stacks of reel to reel tapes of Sharon Jones and Reigning Sound records that I love along the walls.
I knew we had a good song but since the day we wrote it I had wanted that Dap-King special sauce to take it to the next level.
Once we had that original demo, I had one of many "dream come true" moments on the making of this album when the Dap-Kings invited me into Daptone studio in Brooklyn to put the finishing touches on the track with them.
I really have to thank Stephen Wrabel and Drew Pearson for helping me through the past few years and making writing songs a beautiful thing again. Both of those men made my art/work safe and fun, and every session with the two of them was so healing.
and when we were putting the song together, we sprinkled in the psychotic-sounding "laugh track" of us just yelling and laughing at each other throughout the song.It's my favorite because it really captures the joy of this day, this collaboration team and this song.
We were delirious and laughing through the whole rest of the writing session. At one point, we were supposed to be doing vocals and Wrabel and I just lost it and laughed for an entire vocal take - we called that the laugh track -
we had to call a handyman who helped remove a window so we could crawl out before we died of asphyxiation.
It was one of those songs that just happened as much as it was written. We were like three little kids going fucking crazy. We were just giddy, singing in the vocal booth until we realized that we had somehow (Drew!) gotten ourselves locked in the vocal booth ...
We were just making it up as we went. Wrabel and I got in the booth together singing vocals together and I sing "I do what I want” and he sings "she does” and I go “say what you say” and he goes “aahh” and I go “work real hard every day” and he starts laughing.
That day was one of the best writing sessions of my life. It was pure raw joy. I have never had such a wonderful and hilarious work day as I did that day. It was one of those days I'll remember forever, because it brought me back to why I wanted to ever start making music.
It was such a beautiful experience to write such a strong female empowerment song with two men, Drew Pearson and Stephen Wrabel, because it reinforces how supportive men can be of women AND feminism.
I just really fucking love being a woman and I wanted an anthem for anyone else who wants to yell about being self-sufficient and strong. (Yes, men, this song can be for you too.)
We decide if we populate the Earth, and if so, with whom. We could just decide not to have any more kids and the human race would be over. That is power.
I have always been a feminist, but for much of my life I felt like a little girl trying to figure things out. In the past few years, I have felt like a woman more than ever. I just feel the strength and awesomeness and power of being female. We hold the key to humanity.
I told them, I'm not fucking with you - this is the mood I'm in - and this is the song we are writing today.That day in particular I felt like I had earned the right call myself a motherfucking woman.
The two men I was writing with that day didn't quite know what to do with me. I proclaimed again: "I'm a motherfucking woman"! Then Drew Pearson got on the piano and Wrabel started laughing.
I was really feeling that conviction one particular day while I was stuck in traffic on my way to the studio and out of nowhere I felt the urge to scream, "I'm a motherfucking woman." By the time I got the the studio, I was chanting "I’m a motherfucking woman."
When I went back to finish recording "Rainbow," I had a whole new confidence in my voice because I had just gone on an entire tour and carried the whole thing with that voice.
No safety net, nothing to help out or distract from anything if I hit a fucked up note. It put the pressure on me in a good way. I had to rise to the occasion and take control of my voice and in the process I gained a lot of confidence in my vocal ability I've never had before.
Even though I didn’t have new music out in the world I was sick of waiting around, and I had a lot of raw crazy energy and wanted to reconnect with my fans. It was a sink-or-swim situation - it was either me sing my ass off or sound like shit, because it was just me singing.
A huge turning point for me was my recent tour with my band, The Creepies. On that tour, we did away with many of the big pop gimmicks: no dancers, no screens, no backing vocalists, no backing tracks - it was just my band and I letting it all out onstage.
I wanted this song to capture that organic, raw, soulful sound and keep the imperfect moments in the recordings because I find the magic in the imperfections.
There were one or two or 12 different people playing real instruments together, and all that real human energy is exciting and very fun to listen to.
With "Woman," I hope my fans will hear that wild spirit still strong inside me but this time it was created more raw, spontaneously and with all live instrumentation, which I found was a huge reason I loved the records I did love.
They all couldn't be more different sonically from what I was doing, even though the same wild spirit was there. I realized that for most of my life I was intimidated to even try and run in the leagues of the people I look up to.
but it was funny to me that I would go play huge EDM festivals and then I’d go onto my tour bus and get out my record player and put on Iggy Pop, Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, T Rex, Dolly Parton, James Brown, Beatles, The Sweet; any of those records.
Musically, I really couldn't be more proud of this record. I think that this album sonically sounds more like the music I listen to than anything else I’ve ever done in the past. I love the music I have made before, https://t.co/SyXLfG0mnW
remember the time me and drew pearson and wrabel wrote my new single WOMAN and then i got stuck in the vocal booth and almost died but at least i know how to use power tools and had a little rośe 👌🏽👻 https://t.co/GfiugVDzfU

And most importantly just remember to give yourself a break!
This holiday season, I will be missing a beloved member of my family who passed away recently, but I have to remember to be thankful for the family that I do have and careful not to fall into an existential crisis downward spiral.
And you know what? If you take a little time for yourself, you will actually be much better company for those around you.
That can turn into a shame cycle. It’s just another day — don’t put unrealistic expectations on it, and don’t beat yourself up. Trying to spend all of your time pleasing everyone else is not only exhausting — it’s impossible.
Especially since sometimes it’s not that easy to make yourself happy, either — even with all the celebrations and gifts and seasonal decorations, foods and drinks, which can only do so much. So don’t ask yourself things like “It’s almost Christmas, why am I not happy?”
Download one of the many meditation apps for your phone. I particularly like “Calm” and “End Anxiety.” It’s not your responsibility to try to make the whole world happy.
Take a walk in nature. Talk to a friend you trust or a therapist. Sit out one of the holiday gatherings in favor of some personal time. Just do whatever helps you calm down and gives you a break from the stress.
Around the holidays, I often feel like I’m supposed to be everywhere, with everyone — all with the added guilt that it’s the season of giving. To fight this, I’ve developed a mantra: It’s not selfish to take time for yourself.
and when that routine is broken, it can trigger things you may not be ready to face. I know it has for me. It was during the holidays when I hit a low moment and with the help of my mother decided to seek help for my eating disorder.
Or you aren’t invited to those tempting parties. In so many ways, the holidays can throw you off your game — and that can shake you. When you have a routine, it’s easier to manage whatever mental struggles you may be faced with,
Or maybe you’re alone when everyone else is with family. Or you are off from work, with more time to think troubling thoughts. Or you are at work and can’t be with those you love.Or you are thrust into party situations that tempt your demons.
This is especially true for those of us who struggle with mental illness — be it depression, anxiety, addiction or any other challenges. The holidays break your routine. Sometimes, you’re forced to spend time with family you rarely see and don’t always get along with.
The holiday season is supposed to be the most festive and fun time of the year but sometimes it can quickly become a stressful and emotional time. All those plans and expectations of joy can turn tougher than they sound. https://t.co/7pjRZ1u4vV
