@kalieshorr It was truly impressive
@kalieshorr The best part about this is your tweets are like your texts. In this case, it’s 3 that could’ve been 1 😂 the cheese thing though... you should be proud of that.
@BroncoGirl2487 Good call. I wasn’t super into that one growing up so he didn’t stick with me
@Everybody_Sings I think he’s not complex enough for my taste. But great bod!
My main Disney crush fluctuates between Aladdin and the Beast (pre broken curse.) Jasmine is up there too... a girl with a pet tiger AND abs? Can’t get much more badass than that.

Cuppy and I can’t wait to see you today!    https://t.co/TMH2lZ1hEg

SO excited for this tomorrow! Come hang with me and the pups 🖤 https://t.co/vHDgO2dwxd
@ryanholl @Walmart Love how you’ve already changed your story btw. Shows how reliable the initial statement was.
@ryanholl @Walmart Not two. It was a half hour. Confirmed with my team. Before you start rumors about someone you don’t know, double check your facts.
@ryanholl @Walmart How in the world did you land on that? If I’ve ever done 1 song at a show, it’s been because that was asked of me. However, I do remember that show &amp; I played well over 1 song. Think a company as huge as Walmart would ask me back if I had disrespected them like that? Boy bye 🙄
Surprise! Thanks for having me, @Walmart! #TakeYouHome https://t.co/sLP4AaA7ut
@fleischster I think it’s a dear deer

@ShaneButler17 Never said they weren’t talented. Just don’t think the screaming parts fall under a melodic category. It’s more rhythmic. The hooks are melodic though! Was a big fan of Underoath so I do dig a few screamo bands 🤷‍♀️

Really excited to be a part of this. See you all there 💕 https://t.co/0RCZGuV5a1
Maybe it’s the altitude but when @jtimberlake went into the stands at the end of his halftime performance I got choked up. Love when an artist that massive still makes an effort to show the fans how much they matter. What a special moment 👌
Soooo @IncubusBand in Vegas last night was BADASS. Now about to watch the #superbowl on a flight back to Nash. Life is fun!! https://t.co/mSxBo6kljk

My phone autocorrected my text saying “sending the music” to “sending the mucus.” I know for a fact I type “music” WAY more than “mucus.” So here I am confused.....
When you’re afraid to put your phone on any counter in your kitchen because it might be wet, you know you threw a good party. Hi 2018. So ready for ya.

@allibow8 Girl it happens to the best of us
I have to actively over pronounce “ash” in the word “ashtray.” Otherwise I say “asstray” and that is a MUCH different conversation.
Rock out indeed. To new songs, in fact :) https://t.co/Pb4gk6y5vc
@T_Brum23 @DemiLikeMoore So great meeting you all!
I was going to tweet that I think “Eggnogged out” should be an actual term because too much of it is no good. Then I made the mistake of googling it to check if it was already a thing. Damn you, Urban Dictionary. 🤢

Made it out!! Fueling up and then headed home!
An update for those asking: It's been about 27 hours now on the turnpike. We're told we'll be able to turn around at some point tonight.
Still stuck! Saw a bunch of cars that were towed out and driving in the opposite direction so that's good news. Luckily, we're in a tour bus
@nashvillegab ☺️☺️☺️ we're so lucky to be on this house on wheels. Can't imagine how rough it is for the people in cars. So scary
