My latest column for Home⭐️Front: When mom deploys https://t.co/PI3paHB2Se
Wife of former Army chaplain says her husband, a father of 7, was discharged from VA hospital to a homeless shelter against medical advice. She traces his rapid cognitive decline to a disease he contracted on a deployment to Africa.  https://t.co/9fUtXLA2NY
@jolly1766 Yes! Applied very thinly over buttered toast. #vegemite

@sgtcheryldorsey @CNNNewsroomLA @cnnbrk @CNN Thanks for coming on today!
@jimsciutto I’ll hold you to that. I know where you work.
The president used the offensive phrase “off the reservation” today to describe Ann Coulter. He knows it’s racist roots. He pounced on Hillary Clinton when she used the phrase to describe him: https://t.co/rOggWuJULT
You guys, @jimsciutto has a new book coming out in May! He hasn’t promised me a free copy but hopefully he will now that I’ve tweeted this. #TheShadowWar Inside Russia and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America https://t.co/mX6LW2BLvu
My latest HOME ⭐️ FRONT column: Coast Guard families were pushed to their breaking points in the shutdown. They don't expect it to be the last. #HomeFrontCNN https://t.co/7F2dqx7vHt
WH Comms Chief @mercedesschlapp just told @jimsciutto “We were very tough on Steve King.” 🤔 The President didn’t even criticize @SteveKingIA for saying “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?”
@bilodeausr Yes! Please email me homefront@cnn.com
@SeanOD2 Yes! I will get back to you today. We had a lot of emails, which is a very exciting response, but I’ve not been able to go through each one yet.
Coast Guard family worried about the fast approaching Feb 15th deadline to avoid another shutdown? Email me. homefront@cnn.com https://t.co/rUv0o3AOm0

A huge thank you if you’ve emailed me for the #HomeFrontCNN column. I’m reading through hundreds of emails and am thrilled by the feedback and story ideas from across the country.

@DougHeye I will never live this down, will I?
@RabidBadger @CNN @SteveKingIA @AOC Your characterization is wrong. We discussed multiple, unrelated topics in a political panel - Steve King’s racist comments and then Politico’s reporting on Dem frustrations w/ Ocasio-Cortez. We discussed them separately and drew no relationship or equivalency between the two.

@KyungLahCNN I was thinking the exact same thing!
👏👏👏 https://t.co/KjCmZMJXFN
@mpiersall1 @vardmin @CNNnewsroom I’m sorry you haven’t gotten the empathy you have needed in your life. And I’m sorry you think the proper response is to pass that mistreatment on to others with all the courage of an anonymous tweet. But thank you for bringing out some really heartwarming responses from others.
It’s definitely not a violation of the Hatch Act to say you’d like to get paid for work you’ve done or you don’t want to be furloughed or you can’t make ends meet because you won’t get the back pay from your contract janitor/cafeteria/security job. Still, they’re wary. https://t.co/U2yiqBpDMU
@FrenettMarco Thank you!
I hear you but here’s what you should know - a lot of workers, federal or federal contract, are very wary of talking to the media because they’re worried they’ll get in trouble at work. We had also booked someone else on this topic and they ended up cancelling. https://t.co/dH9zSewIMU

@d_mccarthy37 @lillyrosebacon1 @AmericanLife777 It would seem like yes, no and at least not right now?
@sam_vinograd @joshscampbell Thanks for making me feel better about my wimpiness! 😂
@Tweetqualizer_ It puts the lotion in the basket.
@JPnMiami Yeah, I think they were trying to make the interloper uncomfortable enough to eventually leave.
@joshscampbell Read the Wikipedia of the plot and you’ll do just fine. 😂
@kairyssdal Thank you so much for the moral support!
@Descender421 Yes, because my husband really wanted to see it. I also read the entire plot before watching it. And I didn’t really like it, tbh.
@janice09271 Ha! In fairness, I’ve seen like 4 scary movies in my lifetime.
I can only watch scary movies if I know exactly what’s going to happen. When I was 11 I watched Silence of the Lambs and had to sleep on my parent’s bedroom floor for three nights. https://t.co/3PZ7Uq2AtD
There’s no way I could’ve watched Bird Box without knowing exactly what was going to happen. I still enjoyed it and thought it lived up to the hype. I just wish I could sleep in my parents room tonight. 😬 https://t.co/ETIOn5c2SU
To be clear, I really liked the movie. But I was white knuckling it even with knowing exactly what was going to happen.
@x3veronica Ahhhhh! If you get into work before me can you newspaper my office window? I’ll bring blindfolds.
@whatsnewpdq I actually like it! But I might not sleep for a week now.
Too late! And now I’m going to triple check on the baby and put newspaper over all our windows before I go to bed. https://t.co/ujX3AuMJSY
@AmericanLife777 It is SCARY. I had to read the plot so I wouldn’t be surprised by anything and I am still not sure I will ever recover.
@WestportMoxie Oh I think Sandra Bullock is great but I am SCARED!!!
Let me preface this by saying I generally don’t watch thrillers. But I had to see what all the Bird Box buzz is about. I read the entire plot on Wikipedia beforehand and I still keep pausing it just to see how much time I have left to endure.
2019! What could go wrong?
Oh, don’t worry. They stage their coup soon. https://t.co/3zFXE5U54u
@andersoncooper @Andy - I’m pretty sure @BrookeBCNN and @donlemon would sing “Islands in the Stream”. And get piercings or tatts while doing so.

Watching @richardquest in white tie reminds me of doing live shots next to him in 07. The Queen was in DC for a rare white tie state dinner. Richard decided he needed to be white tie for his coverage (natch) and secured the attire in about an hour. He was not wearing a hot dog.

@KateBennett_DC @andersoncooper But “not Apocalypse Now Marlon Brando ... On the Waterfront Marlon Brando”. V v important distinction.
Also, @randikayeCNN is running a racket on her NYE assignment for yet another year, this time from St Bart’s where she’s faux-ducted a fluffy dog named Versace, rode a crane and is hanging out on a superyacht. I need a piece of this action.
Things I’ve learned: @andersoncooper doesn’t know the difference betw Kylie and Kendall (seriously bless you), loves Canadians, thinks dropping a cigarette butt is “like taking a poop on the street.”
Even if I didn’t work at @CNN watching @andersoncooper and @Andy is the only way I would spend NYE. You never know what’s gonna happen except that it’s gonna be nuts.
Many of you have replied that the president (like he did with Matt Whitaker) is not telling the truth about not knowing Brett McGurk. Either way the point is the same, which is why this tweet is so troubling.
This is a very big deal. And if President Trump doesn’t know Brent McGurk that’s not a demonstration that McGurk’s departure is a nothing burger, it’s a demonstration the president has a stunning disinterest in the foreign policy of his country. https://t.co/yNxx1PqNNJ

To everyone hammering @RepCohen for not letting me interrupt him (though I tried many times) his audio settings were such that he was actually hearing himself when he was talking and could only hear me if he wasn’t talking. Our apologies. He was not ignoring me.

FULL INTERVIEW: Clinton '08 campaign director Patti Solis Doyle on HRC overruling her recommendation to fire faith advisor Burns Strider for sexual harassment. Strider then fronted a Clinton superPAC in '16 cycle, was fired after harassing other women. https://t.co/bqYDs1xIMv
Speaking for myself here. Legalistic, putting caution before candor, reflexively protective to the point that it misses an opportunity to be bold. https://t.co/JRH8zgyGHb
Journalists shouldn’t fail to report and discuss facts because one party may try to use those facts against another. That violates the very mission of journalism. https://t.co/BYUir50ZWn
Because incidents like these illuminate how harassment claims are handled, especially when stakes are high. How can we learn from them if they aren’t examined? https://t.co/UsgN2DdOWM
If you switched out Strider’s name for a Trump aide’s would you still stand by this tweet? https://t.co/RjNAzkHLhg
This response to Strider story is quintessential Hillary Clinton. Women who wanted Strider fired don’t speak on record, Clinton spox gives a lawyers statement, Clinton can’t admit she was wrong to think demoting Strider while reassigning his accuser was adequate. Cc @rubycramer https://t.co/42R1ZbNW8x
After Clinton let Burns Strider stay on the 08 campaign (while reassigning his accuser) he went on to lead her shadow campaign PAC, harass other women, touching them and messaging them inappropriately and accessing their schedules. Story by @rubycramer  https://t.co/DPjCw5KvMU

Clinton tells Wellesley grads the world needs their smarts, curiosity, stubbornness.
As she encourages c/o 2017 to run for office HRC quotes A League of Their Own: "It's supposed to be hard. The hard is what makes it great."
Clinton: Your learning, listening and serving should include people who do not agree with you.
It has been 8 days since @realDonaldTrump tweeted anything reactively. It's like @HillaryClinton is daring him with this scathing speech.
Clinton continues: "That is not hyperbole, it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done. They attempt to control reality."
HRC: "When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society"
Clinton slams Trump budget for cuts to Medicaid and programs for poor, opioid funding.

2) The media actually withheld details at the request of government officials, citing security concerns. https://t.co/3Jk5JPr1ZK
1) it's in public interest to know the president is nonchalant with the most sensitive of classified info. https://t.co/3Jk5JPr1ZK
In past week POTUS has made liars of his VP, his press shop and now his National Security Advisor after they tried to nuance his mistakes.
Pres. Trump is standing by his judgment call to disclose highly classified info that could put lives in danger as proper. https://t.co/JzDr6Zc4pP

"Why did POTUS fire Comey?" is not a gotcha question @PressSec If that's a Q that entraps the answerer it's by no fault of the questioner.
This is not about "perfect accuracy", it's about whether they even know what is accurate or if they're even trying to be accurate. https://t.co/SguJazYUfq
And Spicer states wrongly that collusion betw Trump associates/Russia is debunked. 3/
Spicer won’t comment on possibility of listening devices in White House, if Comey convo recorded, threat to cancel WH briefing. 2/
Briefing recap: Spicer doesn’t know if Trump has confidence in McCabe, hasn’t asked Trump abt asking Comey if he was under investigation. 1/
Spicer refuses to say if there are tapes or listening devices, if Comey's convo with Trump recorded. https://t.co/bQXkYkaq7P
.@kwelkernbc with the q "shld we take [this] to mean you don't have the full pic when you stand at that podium?" Spicer: we do our best. https://t.co/SguJazYUfq
And yet he also says he hasn't talked to the president about it ... so, objection: speculation? https://t.co/dfKkcgSfgc
Spicer, asked again about listening devices in White House: "The president has no further comment on this."
Spicer says he hasn't asked Pres. Trump why he asked Comey if he was under investigation.
Pres. considering cancelling briefing? Spicer says Trump is dismayed by coverage but dodges question.
Spicer says Pres. Trump did not ask Comey to be loyal to him.
On whether Pres. Trump recorded convos with Comey or has listening devices in the Oval or residence, Spicer declines to answer.

It doesn't need to be declassified for intel committee members to see it. They have security clearances like Nunes does. https://t.co/mPxSQxqJmt
But then Nunes briefed Trump and gave his bogus wire tap claim cover before looping in committee members. These events are not singular. https://t.co/G9WSySUMcL
The info that Nunes was given by WH officials that even Republicans on the House intel committee besides Nunes have yet to see. 2/2 https://t.co/XYIH9oTczE
Context: Surveillance of foreign officials that Nunes said "incidentally" intercepted Trump aides talking to those officials. 1/2 https://t.co/XYIH9oTczE
@lwmarsha my point was the process is meaningful, shouldn't be dismissed as insignificant process.
It's not serious for Spicer to dismiss Nunes getting info *from* WH, briefing Trump, holding presser before looping in committee as process.
And brings into question his independence from the White House, which is part of his investigation on Russian interference in election. https://t.co/2lgHTr2gXi
It *is* about the process, bec the process by which Nunes obtained info, briefed Trump brings into question his ability to do his job.

Yes, he spent most of it talking crowd size not abt role of intel in national security. https://t.co/aZR54GVFFC
Pres. Trump spent most of remarks at CIA memorial talking crowd size at inauguration and campaign rallies, not US intel.
Pres. Trump at CIA expresses regrets for not keeping oil in Iraq, says "maybe we'll have another chance," hinting at another Iraq invasion.

great q by @MariaESalinas to Sanders: why should voters prefer career politician to an establishment politician?
Clinton's answer: I have a record, called out Wall St before great recession, Obama took money from Wall St and signed Dodd-Frank into law.
Sanders again calls for Clinton to release her transcripts of speeches paid for by Wall St firms. Clinton has struggled repeatedly w this Q.
Great write by @seungminkim on Sanders' record on immigration from last year: https://t.co/pnpSviUbiA
Note Sanders doesn't say he voted against immigration reform *because* LULAC against. Just states LULAC opposed. He sided with labor in 07.

(2/2) Sanders answered by pointing to Riegle's comments on campaign finance and said he appreciates his endorsement.
Riegle is a corporate lobbyist. I asked Sanders if he's right endorsement when getting $ out of politics is a pillar of his campaign. (1/2)

Clinton speech playing at Sanders HQ. Loud cheers when she congratulated him. Jeers, boos, laughing when she talked abt money in politics.
Sanders only wrote one speech - a victory speech - an aide tells @danmericaCNN. No just-in-case concession speech for him in New Hampshire.

@SallyGAbrams @jaketapper I know! Conflicting emotions for sure.
Sec. Clinton had 1.5 honeybee lattes (with espresso, honey, cinnamon) at Scenic Route. Not 1, not 2, but 1.5. Per an informed source.
Clinton also went to Scenic Route coffee shop for their signature "honeybee lattes" and monkey bread with Chelsea and her husband, Marc.
Earlier today Clinton took HyVee donuts to volunteers in Des Moines, thanking them for all their hard work.
Afterward I bumped into Clinton at her hotel and she was all smiles, still wearing her sunglasses and parka. Seemed in very good spirits.
Clinton walked around Gray's Lake in Des Moines this afternoon w her husband-no staff, no photographer-to clear their heads, talk, relax.

@DMBismysanity thanks for watching! Convos like this are very important to answering this almost impossible Q of how to stop this.
@DMBismysanity I've heard psychologists say shooters wld just find a diff "motive" to do it. Motive is to terrorize society writ large.
@DMBismysanity def see your point ... But maybe he would've found another target? "motive" may just be an excuse to do something terrible.
@DMBismysanity @BVGamble certainly motive of racism clear in # of crimes. But in mass killings mental proba may be primarily responsible.
@DMBismysanity @BVGamble UCSB shooter "motive" was sexism, Sandy Hook was bullying, SC racism. Real motive is to flip off society.
@DMBismysanity @BVGamble the point article makes is racism (or bullying etc) very secondary to psychological issues.
