My kids have come first and will remain first but when I go back blonde next week I might start looking at myself again.... 😏
I can say that being alone has taught me a lot. Being alone and being a mother has made me so strong that only the strong will be noticed now. Weak shit, weak people, weak anything will never be welcome. 👩‍👧‍👦
What an amazing life I’ve had this far. Couldn’t be more proud and happy with my outcome of myself. Thank you to all the love and support out there. Truly helps.
I’m going to hold my babies extra tight tonight before they close their eyes. 💔

You know what I hate the most. When that string that ties sweats come out. Shit is instant mood killer.
Yesterday I got the “you’re the best mom”.  All I needed and will ever need.
Going above and beyond this year for the holidays.  Kids and I deserve it.  Never felt more festive. Really taking every minute in.
Thinking about getting a new dog. Of course rescue one... in need of some puppy love right now. 😂
Pain will not tamper with my hope and love I still choose to carry.
I will not numb myself. I will exercise my emotions. I will not lean on temporary highs to escape but will hold myself out for the healthiest happiest life. Authenticity is my gift to the world and mine.

I’m vulnerable but I ain’t stupid.
Longest I’ve gone without any type of male attention... a cleanse I needed.

So tired of people calling celebs out for promoting products and I’m not even talking about myself.  If shoe was on other foot haters would be glad to do what we do. Another day in the biz. What we do...lol

The kids and I are so proud of @TheHankBaskett for going out and helping put out fires around Calabasas. He saved many homes without the people probably even knowing. Great job Hank! 👏🏻
Thank you to all the men and women who are out there putting their lives at risk to keep us safe. Thank you! #heroes
After talking with Alijahs teachers aid yesterday about her friend being killed at Borderline, i go to the class window to look out n all i see is clouds of smoke. Ugh. Heavy hearts as we are evacuated now. Hoping everyone stays safe n homes are saved. 🙏🏻

@SteelerzBucs Lmao
Couldn’t have been a more perfect Monday morning. Dropping a plate of food n breaking plate, pan catching on fire, smoke detector going off, missing keys. Lol. Next...😂😫
I cannot control how people see me. I cannot force someone to love me. All i know is everyday when i wake up I’m healthy, forgiving, open, full of love for my kids n myself. I can’t control anything else outside of that.
@ShellsBerry Lol yep
Good things happen n bad things happen to all of us. It’s what we choose to carry in the bag over our shoulder. I carry the good. Glass half full no matter the pain. Choice. Train the brain. Forgiveness. Kindness. https://t.co/ZIGm6qTEco
Happy Friday!!! https://t.co/6eOu53Ydbt

Why we make ourselves believe in shit that destroys us. When we were just fine before we believed in it.
Why is life full of pain? Do we do it to ourselves?

Healthy juice, soups, dressings. From Erewhon. Obsessed. https://t.co/JqvAs8Okup
Time to make serious sacrifices.
The work we do that’s unseen we won’t get credit for but all that matter is that YOU know n you can go to bed proud. Never wait on someone to be proud of u. YOU be proud of YOU
I’m one great mother fucker that deserves everything great.
It’s not my problem dumb ass people have created an image of me that isn’t real.
If you’re doing the best u can in your life n u can check off everything on the list of your goals met every day then nobody has any right to say you’re doing anything wrong n have no place in your day or time.
I believe in a journey. Which means i believe that everything i go through is a great lesson. Even when I’m on my knees begging for mercy.
There’s no difference between being influenced and brainwashed and taking advice from people who have zero idea who you are.
I don’t spend one minute of my life unfocused. I have full control of every thought n decision i make. Not one person can interrupt me. Advice from anyone other than 3 people (old   n wise) is not accepted. Love, smiles and support is always accepted . ☺️
Good morning. #CarpeDiem

“Just be happy” -everyone
If one more person tells me to “focus on kids” “you’re kids come first” i think imma lose it.
I cut everything I’m trying to impress out of my life n giving myself the room to just be exactly who i am. No guilt for gaining a pound, no second guessing myself, no asking for permission to do what i want to bring a smile. Everything else is accepted. 🙌🏻
Gooood morning. 🧚🏻‍♀️

Paps got me almost eating shit on one of those birds or whatever they are. Lol. 🛴 🤦‍♀️
Every single thing is a test. Being on tv was just one of them. Putting blame on those kinds of things is a easy cop out. We r responsible for ourselves at the end. https://t.co/5VHOadr7fv
@Shake_em420 I know. Lol not mad girl. I know she meant well. Love it just asked what she meant
We all have different ideas of what happiness means n even looks like. Some feel they are there. Mine is found through the discovery because it’s fun n that’s where humor lies. I like to laugh n feel surprised. 😜
Right. That’s what I’m doing. Thanks https://t.co/70xfPv7vqo
What does that mean? Not mad i just want to know what you mean by this? https://t.co/9mR76bA0QT
The only question that will remain after all is done is Do I believe in marriage?  It’ll be a fun quest to be on to discover that answer when the time is right.
I told myself if I’m going to go through this pain i want to be able to feel it all without numbing or enabling. Avoiding bad advice and being content being alone are 2 things I’m having to work through. The “you need this n that” really gets under my skin.
You have to be willing to feel it all in order to truly understand and move forward. Avoiding cover ups and attempts to numb.  Surrendering and letting go is the last step n I’m in it. 🙌🏻
Leaning so much right now. It’s a blessing. Couple come to Jesus moments I’ve been having but weights being lifted. Feeling lighter n more free
Focusing all my energy on finding myself vs losing myself. Staying woke and laser focused. Every now n then treating myself with little things or big. 😜😏
Good afternoon 😃

I don’t follow or care too much about pop culture but the Kim nude n Kanye speaking mind I appreciate cuz I’m also against the sheeplike mindset.
Nudity doesn’t aways mean sex. Sometimes people just wanna be nude. So what. I just don’t see anyone wrong with it. Idk u guys?
My kids don’t give a fuck if someone is nude or not.
Omg Kanye speaking his mind. Something is wrong. 🤦‍♀️
I still see people talking about nudity like it’s taboo still. I can’t... 🤦‍♀️

Getting the privilege of being a parent n never being judged. Always praised.  Plus no guilt while out with the dudes for couple beers, playing golf. Living the goddamn dream. 😂 https://t.co/tIpVVXuFQV
Ya cool but u still gotta take it from the beer bong. https://t.co/lutnQkJFyU
@Shmoooo 😍😍😍😍
I’ve met all types of mothers. Sometimes mothers have to leave their kids to provide. They become heroes to their kids. Not all lives look the same. We have to accept that cookie cutter shit isn’t the only way.
The one thing that people really don’t know about me is how i raise my kids. That’s my most personal thing.  I feel like it’s my own little secret.  My 2 kids are the greatest 2 humans i know n not saying this cuz I’m their mom. 😜
@fresnogrizzly 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
@ReidMyLips1947 😂😂😂😂😂
@RebeccaLynn0717 Sure that’s fine lol. I don’t judge.
Lol https://t.co/due5E3Q5jK
I don’t trust moms unless they pass my beer bong initiation. 😂😂😂🐑🐑🐑
One thing I’ll never do is fall into the sheep like mentality.
Honestly who the fuck wrote the rule that once u have a kid u gotta “grow up” n who said we can’t be who we are? N who said to feel guilty for enjoying yourself as an adult?
It’s been a long roller coaster ride since then. Lol https://t.co/BLac43G6Yn

The most important time in your life is right now at this moment. Let go of the past and have fun dreaming. Enjoy life’s little pleasures. Take control n prioritize who n what deserves this time.
2018 has been so far the hardest start to a year in my life. Kickin my ass n putting me through a true test... but I survived this far. I choose to stand strong, be grateful n smile. Life is too short.
#TheGreatestShowman https://t.co/fxCL1CWey2
@laura19191 Lol 😂
@lindyjane4746 Lol wed get along
I respect n think people r nice n I’ll be there for them but to hang out n call u a friend man that’s a different story. You have to pass years of tests n not just relate being a mom. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You also don’t have to be friends with people just because you both are moms. Never understood that. If they’re not your type then they’re not your type.
This is a copycat like society n i try so hard to not fall into it n think that’s the only way. Robotic type shit.  Don’t be afraid of being a unique parent. Fuck the Joneses 🖕🏻
I don’t believe in boys have to do this n girls have to do that. Fuck that shit.   I’m a free spirit n that’s my twist on parenting. I don’t care about anyone’s way but our own n theirs.
Me n my fam are always on the go. Always introducing them to new sports n activities. We have no boys n girls rule. Both get to decide who are.
Lol.  Not a dance mom. Tellin u.  I don’t like small spaces with other people. Lol. Always on edge. 😂😂 https://t.co/KQJGlLd9KJ
At Alijahs dance class n i pray she starts loving softball or something. #notadancemom 😫😂

@Kerristj @CoachChristinaF Also be careful with healthy food too like kale 😃😘
@HarvEwilliams23 Wowww amazing. Thanks for sharing. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
U need to focus on what food helps your metabolism n what hurts it. Metabolism is key 🔑 https://t.co/28p66BIgnZ

Have a bad under active thyroid so i have to be very careful how i eat.
LOW baby. That’s more realistic. I personally don’t like having a ball of bread in my gut all day and the sugar rush ain’t my thing... makes me nauseous lol https://t.co/md1AvPMVYW
@EarlyHippie Ya that’s actually a good idea
@dgirlatl Lol thanks. It’s in the mind that I’ve been lazy. Need to get off my ass lol
Haha go. Do it for me too. U beat me to it. 🙌🏻 https://t.co/OMuAVFXS9x
High fiber, very low carb, sugar and sodium, lots of water no juice n stuff. Other than that i eat what i want. Gym, i just keep heart rate up for at least 30/40 min. That’s it. 😃 https://t.co/pNtlbHDfCF

I look forward to a bright future but u darken my day.... fuck em
I will never be the type to mold into my surroundings just to fit in. I believe in holding on to my own identity. If u don’t like it.... fuck em
My past mistakes I’ve let go but if u can’t let go and hold that against me, life’s too short... fuck em
I’m going to do what the fuck makes me happy... fuck em
Sometimes i get caught up in the thought “how can i change to make this person like me” then i wake up n know that “i like me” fuck em
Never apologize for being YOU. If you feel like u have to, Time to move on... u only have so much time on earth enjoying the real YOU. Fuck em

I try n live by the rules of nature more  than the rules of society. Other than my boobs and lips. 😂😜
My quotes are always from me and what I’m dealing with at the moment and what I’ve naturally learned throughout the years of my life to get by.  Just like to share w u all. ☺️
@ddreamer38 Thank you 😊
@drbostero Don’t need a book. It’s common sense. It’s the natural way of living. 😜
Droppin the mic 🎤
You are the only one responsible for how you react to life’s tests.  Gratitude and appreciation of life will help. Fighting won’t.
The sooner you admit your faults the sooner you’ll feel free
It’s ok to cry. Let it out or it’ll turn into anger.
To be happy you have to learn to accept pain, breathe through it and let it go. Covering up n shielding feeling pain is only a temporary survival to get through day but will never experience true happiness.

If you let outside influence change you, You’re done. Stand strong n know yourself. Sometimes the advise you’re getting there’s an intention behind it for themselves. Keep snakes out.
Snakes in the grass. So close i can hear them slither. Beyond venomous.
Hope you all are having a great day. 🤘🏻

@TheDeplorable87 @stephaniebode2 Lol 😂
I’ve been seeing more men with their kids lately n that is also taboo as much as it is a woman working.  All are RIGHT!
@stephaniebode2 Funny cuz not necessarily haters. People not even realizing what they r sayin n asking cuz it’s not normal to them. Weird shit

@djdsmithfield The quality time is the most special thing ever. Every moment counts for everyone
That Q is so weird. U can see right through it n what person is thinking. Lmao. https://t.co/p3RAgYc8jn
The comments. “But don’t you miss your kids”. I can’t n I will make u feel real small if u come at me with that. 😂
Do I miss my family? Of course I do. Is it easy? Fuck no.  Do I feel guilt? NO.
I do not feel guilt with my choice to travel n work as a woman, wife n mother.
A woman, wife n mother traveling for work is still taboo. It’s imbedded in minds that it’s not normal. Even close people.
Yes it is.  😂🙏🏻 https://t.co/xEflj8xerj

@realjonlovitz Hahah LOVE YOU
Mood.... Pardon Me by Incubus
Have a good day.
There's a reason millions of women LOVED Hef. He was a fucking mensch.
Hef just wanted to see beauty in the world. And his. That's it!
I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks, says. Don't care about other perspectives.  I see n know what I do. Fuck the rest.
I appreciate the positive media I've been seeing. I see you guys n respect the fuck out of you.
He made me feel like the most special person on the planet while I made sure his hat was on sideways.   😂. His heart was GOLD
The pride in his eyes when I told him I was marrying he man of my dreams.
His shuffling feet walking by my door at noon.  The time we were both just waking up. 😂😂😂
I always ask myself... how was I so lucky? Out of all the women and people in the world.
I appreciate that I got spend those 5 years with him. Got the time to open my heart n understand who he really was.
No matter what mood I was in. He always made me smile. Always!!!
When we would stare at each other from across the room. Like no one else was there. We made each other smile. From the heart.
For me it was the little things about Hef. The moments I I got to share w him w no cameras around... he always made me laugh.
@GrahamBensinger Thanks for making me smile Graham.
🙏🏻 https://t.co/6wyJ9SbIsX
Can't really put in to words how I really feel. It's easy to say he will be missed and how much I loved him. There's a lot more than that
Thank you for all of your thoughts and condolences guys.

@stephaniebode2 @jairodriguez @HEXXLasVegas Man that was healthy though. 😜
It's so hard being on stage, making a mistake and not just dying of laughter.  Have to bite my cheek til it bleeds. 😂😂
Remember the days we took care of ourselves and wanted to look our best for the play? Vegas food getting us @jairodriguez
So @jairodriguez n I are having issues fitting in to our costumes lately. LMAO. My back fat hangin over, Jai's pants ripping. 😂😂😂😂
I'm just a hopeful person and want to see something special w my fam when we r still alive. 😂😂
I'm proud of my brother for being the stand up man. Must be hard to be in his position. Not fair u n I have to deal with this...
Im proud of my dad for coming back into my life. Even with the guilt he has to live with.  Suck a he ran last night. That's not him anymore
I'm proud of my mom for raising me alone... must have been hard. I credit her everyday. The recent problems have been the only issues w us.
All of us are dealing with the same amount of pain. Just different situations. How we are reacting to it is what we should be focused on.
Everybody had a right to react the way they did. I even told them that night.  I'm proud of mom, Dad n bro for facing such pain.
I love my mother as much as my father n love my brother as much as both. Not choosing a side, choosing to understand.
After last night show, There a lot of Why didn't u do this, why didn't u do that, why u choose this side or that side? Here's the reality...
It's Indian food tonight. 😂 damnit. We r so lazy. https://t.co/EUtFkS7H4y

Forgiveness is the only way out
The past is painful and fucked up n easy to run from it or fight it. I believe the reason we r given 100yrs is to figure it out... or not.
