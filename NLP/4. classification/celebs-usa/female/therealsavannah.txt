The person I’m rooting for this season is the fence #TheBachelor
@JessBrookePerry Thank you love ♥️♥️
“What it’s about, is not giving up“ @ladygaga, you are incredible &amp; such a role model for all of us women to keep going ⭐️
I saw Justin Timberlake last night and I’m still on cloud 9 and will be for a while
I’ll never miss an opportunity to take a photo in great lighting. And neither should you.
Just recorded one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written and I’m so so so happy
@ColinDieden 100% rockstar
wow it's been such a great morning. the starbucks barista knew my order AND said I looked cozy, discovered amazon customer service ROCKS, and i'm on my way to the studiooooo so wednesdays are great
@elijahnoll @ColinDieden ok fine i'll tell you "almost (sweet music)" by Hozier
I just had a thought. Maybe The Bachelor gives me unrealistic ideas of love????
STOKED to announce I found a new song to play 500 times on repeat for the next week then never listen to it again!
A cute little bird comes on my patio every morning and I swear they hum the intense bridge in “shallow” so I’ve named him/her Lady Bradley
@TimOlstadMusic Wait same LOL
Ok me https://t.co/TNib50FGcv
even when i'm broken feelin kinda hopeless i've never been the one to run away
Just remembered the time I brought my ex to Target and he said I was wasting all my time looking through every aisle anyway I hope he gets his wallet stolen every single day
it means so much to see you guys loving shortcut. this song is so special to me. if you haven't listened, go cry now. I mean.. listen. https://t.co/sO3QuWDPOC
@codyand53897412 Did you read my mind?
Everyone: Any fun valentines plans??  Me: I’ll probably eat an entire box of chocolates and listen to Sara Bareilles entire discography. You?
When you really wanna say something, you say it with a song
Well, me &amp; @LindsayJernigan’s Galentines was a success 💕 Now I’m gonna go sleep for 7 days straight. https://t.co/RYqHCAB4dI
i'm hosting a galentines party this saturday and I have never in my life put more effort into something LOL
iloveu https://t.co/p8eWVhoX3q
@heybradwhatsup @ColinDieden @SurRestaurant He really can 😂
I know life can seem complicated at times, but it's simple. Be generous, be silly &amp; stay positive. ✨
GO SPURS
Wow who needs an alarm clock with the drip drop sound of a leak in your room has the same effect!!!
Coffee stains in jeans are the new thing, right....?
hey I just want you to know that indeed in fact in my session today I said...   "I have to leave at 8 because @MaskedSingerFOX is on" soooo that happened
i'm holding it out for me it's all that I live for
we never quite got to the part where we let each other know our thoughts   just quiet hearts
One of my favorite things I’ve been told is to “stop posting about *nsync and the Backstreet Boys”
“I know if I heard you it would only hurt me”
@ColinDieden ITS CALLED SUSHI COLIN
@arielkassulke @morgxn @mainland @ClearPioneer @newviceswi @DREAMERSjoinus @LewisCapaldi @YAMHAUSBand @LaurenSanderson @elijahnoll @thisisculpriit aww thanks for this &lt;3
It's crazy how I went from eating ONLY chicken noodle soup and picking off the cilantro on my tacos, to literally eating raw dry fish and loving how it "melts in my mouth"
Listen bug I’m trying to give you an out and open some doors to set you free but you just want my warm apartment and I just can’t allow that **an actual convo i just had with a fly**
putting cinnamon in your coffee is the RIGHT THING TO DO
@CordeliaLauryn @lovelorestudio - they are the cutest!
Scrolling through insta and found who is going to do my wedding invites. I need a boyfriend first though.
@RamiJrade @ColinDieden I’ve tried this and it makes an even messier mess so idk what you’re talkin bout
@ColinDieden Your constant support means so much
It’s taken years of practice, but I can finally say today that I can crack an egg open without any shells falling along with it
WE ARE GENIUSES @MaskedSingerFOX https://t.co/gOH5A0JmtW
I’m always super offended when people offer me gum. Like, do they know something I don’t?

i'm craving a salad and a warm brownie. 2019 is the year of balance.
i boxed up all my worries they were slowin me down
@KeatonStromberg You’re welcome 😉
I just organized my fridge and it gave me sweet sweet joy
@MAXHellsKitchen 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
There’s no greater feeling than a Starbucks barista remembering your name and order
Do you ever check to make sure someone’s still following you and then you unfollow them in the process? Asking for a friend...
I really wanna organize my cabinets and fridge. Is this what becoming an adult feels like?
#AStarIsBorn wins in my book 💫 https://t.co/NdcjDUGp91
I saw Schmidt from New Girl today and nearly pooped my pants of excitement. TMI?
@BipolarMomLife @ThisIsMyBrave My manager emailed you &amp; sent his number for you to call him on ♥️😊
Aw thank you love! 💫 https://t.co/5sMiozXxgK
I might’ve lost you but I found myself instead
I just tried paying for my Starbucks with my spotify app. How’s your morning?!
It’s a sad sad day when you go the entire day thinking it’s Sunday, looking forward to tomorrow being The Bachelor, when it’s actually Saturday
At this point, is it cool that I haven't seen #Birdbox?
Me since I haven’t watched #birdbox https://t.co/SSYbWZI0GF
Awww. You’re so sweet, thank you 💫 https://t.co/q61YcMWPmI
In 2019, let’s celebrate the small victories. You haven’t come this far for nothin. Here’s to new beginnings. Because that’s what New Years is all about- getting another chance
2018 was really good to us. We were given A Star Is Born, Mamma Mia 2, a new JT album, bird scooters &amp; royal wedding mania
Aww love this 💫 https://t.co/F5dmyE8VbV
Thank you for loving me 😂 https://t.co/imSptnldJN
Just explained the phrase “I am here for it” to my dad
I mean who would realllllly know if I did or didn’t take my tree down...
@ColinDieden OK THAT IS NOT MY TYPE
smoothies might be my soulmate
You’ll never be New York
“I don’t know what that word means. I just know how to spell it.”
So can I keep my tree up for the rest of the year and jus my switch out the ornaments for Valentine’s Day, St. Patty’s and Easter?
I can do a lot of things but admitting to my mom I’m cold when she told me to bring a jacket is NOT one of them
It’s the season of giving! And by donating just $25 to @thirstproject, you give one person safe, clean drinking water for LIFE!! https://t.co/iLxmsXempt

JOMO - Joy Of Missing Out. Feeling content with staying in and disconnecting as a form of self-care.   Antonym: FOMO
My Saturday night: my heat isn't working / had lucky charms for dessert / was in bed @ 8pm
Trying to schedule out which days I should wash my hair so it can line up with my plans is the closest thing to math as I’ll ever get
All I want for Christmas is your HBO Go password

@Sigridsimmen HAHA BEST TWEET EVER
Life is short. If you have a crush on someone, walk right up to them. Then a little more! Then walk right past them because it’s probably not worth it.
Thank YOU for those sweet words. So happy you connected with it 💕💫 https://t.co/N8ScarjAqB

@ColinDieden Eating breakfast is exhausting

If you have the option to choose to go anywhere in the world right now, would it be to “somewhere” or to “someone”?

@keving31 LOL
@LindsayJernigan @MeghanRienks Most.
My Uber told me I’m a catch so we’re basically dating right?
My Uber asked me if I was 17 because he can’t allow anyone under 17 to go into an Uber by themselves....
Can’t wait to lose an hour of sleep tonight!
Thanks my love!!! https://t.co/iDmn6xP75L

Congrats Arie &amp; Lauren second-choice B #AfterTheFinalRose
"He couldn't have gone about this in a more respectful way" - Lauren  YOU DIDN'T EVEN WATCH LAST NIGHT HONEY #AfterTheFinalRose https://t.co/nCrK9e9HaH
"I regret proposing to you"  -  ARIE THE WORLD ALREADY HATES YOU. WRONG THING TO SAY BUD. #AfterTheFinalRose
I think one of my most profound accomplishments so far has been all the people I’ve gotten to watch #thebachelor and jump on that train
This #Bachelor finale was the stupidest 3 hours of my life &amp; I’m absolutely still watching tomorrow
That is what dodging a bullet looks like ladies. #TheBachelor
And to think...we could’ve had Peter this season #TheBachelor
Laying in my newly fresh warm/just washed sheets, wearing my satin pjs, about to watch “This Is Us”. This is adulthood.

I’m so happy my Uber drivers name is “Cowboy Brian”
Just typed OutKast instead of outcast in casual conversation omg
@wrabel You’re hot. Absolutely.
I’m getting like super tired. Can we petition to get #TheBachelor to start at 7pm?
Arie is like the first guy that has actually eaten the food from this franchise. Mad respect. #TheBachelor
@AndiDorfman The best part is that you mention my ex’s name &amp; seeing him on that fancy dating app 😂
Ohhh this book is too good, @AndiDorfman. #singlestateofmind

@Crislaynebarlow Reel In in Malibu!!!!
@SoCalDisney Reel In in Malibu. THEY WERE THIN AND CRUNCHY AND GOOD.

You ever think that maybe hot chocolate wants to be called “beautiful chocolate” once in a while?
Is it ok when “it” autocorrects to “JT”? Asking for a friend....
Wait so if Lauren and Arie might be in love after saying 14 words to each other, then I’m practically married to the hot barista at Starbucks. #TheBachelor
I’d like to go on a date with the astronaut from the Oops I Did It Again video

Omg Orville, is it really you?! https://t.co/mZIPDZvLxB
Should I start watching #ThisIsUs again? Am I ready to eat popcorn, dark chocolate and root beer all at the same time while ugly crying?
I’m A1 for boarding and the amount of people that have asked me what I do, or how I got this placement is truly satisfying.
@ColinDieden Am I one of those two?
IM CHANGING THE CHANNEL IF WE DONT STOP TALKING ABOUT PILLOW LIPS.. jk I’d never #TheBachelor
@ColinDieden He’s meh

so many highs and lows to this year. but I know there was a reason for everything. The doors that closed led to new ones that opened. ⭐️
reflecting on 2017, I can’t help but see how many lessons were crammed into it. some that I’m still learning, others that were necessary.
A NEW JT SONG IN 5 DAYS?!? YES THANK GOD FOR SOME GOOD NEWS.

Don’t trust anyone who says it’s too early to put your Christmas tree up. You don’t need that negativity in your life.
