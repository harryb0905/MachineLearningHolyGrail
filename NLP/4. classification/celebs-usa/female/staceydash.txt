@Realetti Education is key. That doesn‚Äôt equate to socialism. It equates to liberty and individual economic success.
@reluctantzealot Ok. Your talking about socialism. I‚Äôm not. Completely different. We should not pay taxes for people to get free stuff. Everyone has to work for it. Education absolutely should be priority number one. The best for everyone.

@KevinMKruse @LDBurnett @BLEXIT @RealCandaceO one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing."
@KevinMKruse @LDBurnett @BLEXIT @RealCandaceO emphasizes her willingness to talk to virtually anyone.‚ÄùAlways to me any aroused group was a good group," Sanger writes, "and therefore I accepted an invitation to talk to the women's branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver Lake, New Jersey,
@KevinMKruse @LDBurnett @BLEXIT @RealCandaceO Here‚Äôs a section verified about her meeting with KKK It turns out, Sanger did speak to a group connected to the KKK and wrote about it openly. In Margaret Sanger: An Autobiography, published in 1938, Sanger details her work advocating birth control across the United States.

@weaverXP Nope. You're an atheist? Just drawing a random out of context criticism like you did. Maybe remember what Easter is about and you might think about not being so mean spirited.
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 See what I did there?
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 Yes I do, which is why I am saying no one should be shocked by any of this. In fact, I'm a bit alarmed that so many people were clueless.
@DuboisKyan Thank you. The #FacebookDataBreach topic is not a focus of my campaign, but I wanted to comment on it as it is relative to the nation. Thank you for your donation and support. Everyone and anything is appreciated.
@GiboneyDavid And how exactly is that enforced and how exactly is that monitored? They obviously have shown they can't be trusted to do it themselves. So where does it come from? Who watches the watchers? It's unenforceable.
Where are you going to go to post your lunch and dinner pics, your anti-Trump or Hillary memes, debate in endless comments on gun control or the latest social outrage? Because you think no other social media platform isn't doing the same damned thing?
#DeleteFacebook and their response is #YoullBeBack
Yet common sense says otherwise and no one wants to believe that. Our TVs, phones, Alexa, Echo, computers, browsers all spy on us. But #Facebook ? I better delete my account! You really think your info is gone after you do?
You're this young upstart and one of the richest and most powerful people on the planet and with a straight  face tell the world their privacy is secure. The best part is, people believe you. Or want to believe you.
You create a global online patform where people willingly surrender their most private details, register their personal data &amp; you're just going to sit on that? You will resist all offers from governments, spy agencies and even foreign enemies to protect it? People believe that?
@bigherm3953 @realDonaldTrump @RobChristie11 We've created a medicate everything mentality and thrown out drugs that don't even have proven track records or reasonable assessments of their long term effects.
@johnhoward85 @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera @KatrinaPierson @DiamondandSilk @SebGorka @GovMikeHuckabee @VP @bella_forte_fit A boycott will do nothing. Some will leave and they know most will return. And it will continue. They will just be more careful next time around. What will FB do? Promise this time they mean it? Be aware. Be awake. Be smart.
@Wirrack And even then there's no guarantee that the protection software isn't spying, tracking or compromised. I assume it's all up for grabs.
@momwantsbalance Exactly! You know what you're signing up for by going online. EVERYTHING is up for grabs. So I don't know why so many are shocked at these recent revelations.
@realDonaldTrump @RobChristie11 This is everywhere and an issue my district. It permeates quietly under the guise of legitimate medicine as well.

@ChristiChat @LindaSuhler See my recent tweet on this. I don't know why anyone is surprised.
So while all of this is wrong, I always assumed my digital footprint was being recorded, stored and manipulated despite protestations that it was secure and private.
Zuckerberg said our data is private and people actually believed that? #facebook is a spy network's dream! All your targets not only sign up, they willingly give their most intimate information! They just hand it right over!
...if it's online it's tracked, stored, sold, used and even weaponized. The ludicrous things people post and reveal about their own personal lives and are made public are acceptable. Find out a powerful global enterprise is using and selling private data and THAT is shocking?
Taking a step aside from campaign topics, the uproar over the present #FacebookDataBreach is stupefying. I'm not supporting FB, but did any of us really, truly think this wasn't going on? From the moment we all went online, we knew our data is tracked...

So many celebrities out marching today for children, yet they ignore the victims of the pedophiles who have harmed so many in their own city.
#MeToo should include Corey Feldman and all of those children robbed of their voices. Corey‚Äôs films created a lot of wealth. They generated billions and he was used by this industry. His lone stance and the silence from Hollywood speaks volumes.

@Jaad44 @Ronbo1066 @RepStevenSmith A first small step is stop the incessant media coverage that glorifies these shooters and gives hope they make a name for themselves and inspires copycats. I‚Äôm not saying to censor the media but rather expect higher standards of responsibility from them.
@Jaad44 @Ronbo1066 @RepStevenSmith Absolutely! üíì We are truly dealing with cancer. Multiple causes, no single cure and chemotherapy/radiation treatments will kill good along with the bad and make the body (nation) weaker and sicker as a result. We need to reassess treatment and fast.
@Ronbo1066 @RepStevenSmith There‚Äôs continued danger in politicizing this cultural cancer. The issue transcends politics, it needs to be examined on the molecular level, just like cancer as there are multiple causes and no single cure.

@ScottERogers12 I chose MSNBC first to get right with the sharks. FOX doesn't make a difference to people wanting real change at the local level. If FOX wants to support me, great. If they don't, that's their choice. I have many friends there and they will attest, I've asked nothing of them.
@ScottERogers12 One would think, but I do not. I have not accepted any of the calls for support from FOX because I'm not running as a pawn for headlines. I'm selecting specific media and that's a focus on LOCAL, district media. Now that it looks like this flu is behind me, I'll be making rounds.
@theangrygenxer @WilkowMajority No...they claim hey are above all of that. Which is why Chelsea Handler called me a racist and Trevor Noah said my campaign was a publicity stunt. How tolerant. If I want a publicity stunt, I'll pose for Playboy again. That pays better. üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è
@theangrygenxer Thank you for reading my book. Yes, they can get dirty, but I'm ready for that. They already did it in my first campaign interview which is what I expected. From "clueless" to race baiting, they didn't disappoint, especially the headlines the next day.
@CliffordJLowery Thank you. I wanted it up earlier but not until I felt it was right. That entailed talking to more people, weighing views and even praying about it. üíì
@crfty1 A lot more is coming and calls went out today as I arrange some important community visits with people. Read my platform, it's all there. https://t.co/B5oMfVf64v
My platform for my campaign is up. Please read it. https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX
No matter what state you're in, if you'd like to donate to my campaign to help fight the money machine that thinks my district is bought and paid for; see my platform and click to donate: https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX
Running to get media attention is a common call from the left that is rattled by my entry into this race. Make no mistake, they're shaken up. Out comes the "clueless" cliche and whatever else they use. https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX
I waited until my platform was finally up and ready before asking for additional donations. Have a look at what I want to address and most of all focus onnte district level, not D.C. politics. https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX
I'm running for Congress to represent California's 44th District. My platform is on my website and I would appreciate any donor help in my fight to make real change.   I hope you will check my site and read what I stand for. Stacey  https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX https://t.co/TxCNrBZaTi
Unlike other politicians and the D.C. Belt, I crafted my own platform and paid no one to do it. It's my heart and words and vision. Donors now know what I stand for and the media can't distort what's there: https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX
Finally emerged from this bad flu. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot has transpired. I'm happy to release my platform on my district's issues. Before any critic comments, please read: https://t.co/B5oMfUXvcX
Coming out from behind this flu, I think. Thank you all for understanding.
Bear with me as I came on now to say this is still hitting me. Thanks everyone and I‚Äôll be hitting phones and sidewalks ASAP.
Flu.
@renaissance98 If economic development, true representation for its people, improvement on education and community revitalization are hell, then yes, I guess so.
@AmityReporter @AmityRisingFilm @LeslieTaft1 Do you mean Harvey Weinstein?
@LuisRC44 My point exactly. However the goal is to feed the hysteria driven media machine.
On the couch with the flu, eating @PopcornBuddha , tweeting for the campaign and checking in on some funny people on Amity Island and their latest antics. @LenPetersonJr is George Soros.
Over 100 volunteers &amp; over 500 donors in the opening of this campaign. No giant money machine cranking to preserve the status quo. I'm thankful for all of you. Any bit helps &amp; if you got a call from me personally thanking you, let folks know! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
This hysteria of Russian meddling, tampering, collusion is all a distraction from the fact that some have done all too good of a job ourselves of destroying this nation from the inside out. That's the illusion...great powers fall internally.
@LeslieTaft1 I really do enjoy the whole Jaws thing you folks have going. It always give me a laugh and I wish it was a TV series. I would watch it. Love the characters! üíì
@chahn01 @pulte And this is happening in various forms all over this country. Politics is local, someone once said. We take care of our own, it spreads positively outward like ripples on a pond. Nations rot from the inside out and it all starts with the family unit.
@dont_tread0nme Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
https://t.co/Vcg4clnTWe  My views on race and where we are:
@LeslieTaft1 Maybe the Mayor has some tips!
The media tried again to take what I said out of context. Here is what I have to say, very clearly on the topic of racism and Neo-Nazism. It's attached to this tweet. https://t.co/LkdTb4OXIB
@kirstiealley I'm going to fan girl and blame it on the flu, but I loved you as Savvik in Wrath of Khan. üíì
If you're able to make a donation, I've told people that's a way to help even if you don't live in CA. These elections, this district are targeted to be kept down by the money machine that thinks it's bought and paid for. Help me change that. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
We are being lulled into complacency, to accept mediocrity and a plantation mentality while our neighborhoods deteriorate, drugs and disease continue to spread and education erodes in the shadow of violence. We need to rise up. Together. Change the paradigm.
Thanks to you, tomorrow a press release goes t on the record number of donors to this campaign. From coast to coast people have asked how they can help and donated on my site. Thank you! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@Marissa_Jones77 @kjevonchambers @realDonaldTrump Coming? Been there, go there and I live in the 44th. I wonder if you'd ask the same of Auntie Maxine who doesn't live in her district. https://t.co/8JYD1N5z4B
@MikeGNitevision I'm well aware of what my critics think. I will gain zero in my acting career from this. This also sends an example to my children about doing what is right. It's not about D.C., it's about here.
On the couch still with this flu. I drove yesterday, stopping to talk with people. If you're unregistered or you don't plan on voting, I'd love to hear why. Tweet here. Let's hear from you. I'm not talking about WHO you're voting or not voting for, but not voting in general.
@kjevonchambers @Marissa_Jones77 @realDonaldTrump Thanks for following.
My platform will be up this week. Aside from making sure it's beyond polished for the scrutiny it will receive, I've been within the district and cross referencing with national issues to make sure everything is in sync. My focus is the 44th and its people.
I am excited as I am thankful for the record turnout of support for my campaign. Over 500 donors in just a few days! THANK YOU ALL! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG https://t.co/ngdKCOqOlz
@PopcornBuddha People need to go online and just buy everything out of stock there. I couldn‚Äôt decide on just one thing!
@PopcornBuddha ‚ù§Ô∏è It helps with this flu! Wonderful therapy!
I just got in to find a box of gourmet popcorn from @PopcornBuddha waiting for me and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP EATING IT! Thank you! üçø‚ù§Ô∏è Online ordering can be deadly! https://t.co/sz9PeIbQmu

@RealChr00523440 You're
@RobertJohnDavi @DiamondandSilk When Chelsea Handler tolerantly called me a white supremacist, this was my response. It's not the meltdown, crazy response the left wants: https://t.co/O30wUvDkgy
@RobertJohnDavi @DiamondandSilk This is one of my essays following the Texas shooting and the Second Amendment and where I stand: https://t.co/7KRMI3JXT1
@RobertJohnDavi @DiamondandSilk I address my own missteps in life, the 2nd Amendment, the nonsensical attacks that I'm a "racist" and support racism and neo-Nazis. While the media distorts, my essays on my page are my words. Have a read. https://t.co/O1WNhXXka4
@RobertJohnDavi @DiamondandSilk And until my platform is up thjs week, my essays show a clear picture of who I am and where I stand in my own words: https://t.co/O1WNhXXka4
@RobertJohnDavi @DiamondandSilk Thank you, Robert. This helps so much and I hope people will support me in this run for this district. Anyone out of state can contribute, just click my site and it's that easy to help. Thank you!! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@joemillerfarm You are welcome. It's the least I can do for your support on this and I am grateful. Glad to catch you by surprise and hope again I didn't sound too hoarse with this flu.
This week will mark some new events in this campaign. My platform will be public and there will be a press announcement as well. The turnout for contributions and support has been wonderful and most of all needed in this fight. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@mmazzonejr @POTUS @c0nvey Thank you so much! There‚Äôs so much to do and this helps me in knowing I‚Äôm not alone! üôèüèæ
I‚Äôm so thankful for @DiamondandSilk endorsement &amp; everyone gearing up behind me. After this week the sharper knives will come out after me. I‚Äôm asking for contributions to ammo up against the liberal fund tide. My site is easy to donate and thank you! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
I've been personally calling and thanking donors. Yes, it's really me and I'm hitting the phones every day. ‚ù§Ô∏èhttps://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@DiamondandSilk @POTUS Every bit helps as you will see. I‚Äôm fighting this on a personal, grass roots level and not with the backing of agenda led money machines!
@DiamondandSilk @POTUS I‚Äôm excited to get my platform launched because this is about the District not DC!
@clementbrm @DiamondandSilk @LindaSuhler @POTUS Thank you. I just told my team about @DiamondandSilk and how this is all gaining such great momentum!
@DiamondandSilk @LindaSuhler @POTUS OH THANK YOU! This is brilliant! I‚Äôll be in touch and thank you for this! üôèüèæ
@Teriander Thank you! And if anyone from your state wants to help with a donation that helps a long way! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
Thank you all for so many contributions to this campaign overnight! From CA to PA people have come to my site to donate! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@Futeral I am. I‚Äôm heading out to talk with folks now and sitting down on some things. My platform will be up on my site this week. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG We need people to vote!
@jdbryngelson1 Thank you and bless you. I‚Äôm hoping to launch my platform today as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@EricKV8 #goodpeoplecandisagree
@ClevOHPhoto And I thank you sincerely üíì
@MikieDaPoet My online essays also show who I am in my own words. I hope people will take a look as you will see clearly who I am: https://t.co/O1WNhXXka4
@MikieDaPoet I‚Äôm always learning and spent the last two years re evaluating myself as well. I want real change and excited to post my platform that‚Äôs also going to reveal some exciting things coming for this district.
People from all over the country have donated and I can‚Äôt believe how far and wide they‚Äôve come in! Thank you! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG https://t.co/rxr0ERicC8
The money machine against me will ramp up after this week after an announcement. I don‚Äôt have my volunteers asking for donations on my social media. It‚Äôs my campaign and it‚Äôs the hardest thing to do for it. If you can help donate I would appreciate it. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
I try to set contribution goals every day as I also work on the content for my site. This week my platform will finally go up. I‚Äôve had it vetted by people on both sides of the spectrum to show this is about real people not skin or party colors. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 We need to go beyond political lines. My response to this man was polite but also firm that he knew nothing of real struggle in this district or anywhere outside DC. I don‚Äôt want to change that. I need to. I live here. My children live here.
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 He then went on to ask me about the 44th and in all earnest said ‚ÄúSo what is your industry in the 44th?‚Äù I stared back at him blank faced and knew then that‚Äôs why I have to run. Our industry? Yet, I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs clueless.
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 The answer is no. While I‚Äôm attacked for being an out of touch ‚Äúmovie star‚Äù and of course clueless, most don‚Äôt know I flew to DC last May to explore my possible run. While there a higher end govt. official who was also black, acted all ‚Äúin the hood‚Äù with me for a selfie.
@Blondi1210 Making sure my platform is ready to present. Going from actress to candidate over the last few months is also about making sure the information and conversations I‚Äôve had translate well for results.
@RepStevenSmith I plan on spending as much time in my district as I can and changing the paradigm for perpetual politics as usual in lobbying and running for re election. This is about representing real people and the only way to do that is be real here.
Thank you everyone who made contributions to this campaign.   This week: my website will list my platform and stance on issues, especially on the economic future of the 44th and my plan for increasing time in the district and less in DC. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 Oh wow. Thank you. I wish she could see me and give a hug. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@BrentniMyers Thank you! I set goals every day for donors. I‚Äôm trying for 65 donations today. If you can help make that happen, I would be so grateful! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@RepStevenSmith Exactly. I‚Äôm running the real grass roots campaign and with their money comes the media assault. Some of the morning headlines on my ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù MSNBC interview which was hardly the case from Ari himself.
@RealSaavedra You need to follow me
Making calls this morning and thanking so many. If you‚Äôre in any state and want to help me, my site can take donations with a few clicks. I‚Äôve had a record turnout for donors and need to be able run against a major money machine. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
It‚Äôs #Sunday and I am thankful. Much more work to be done. üôèüèæ
@HarrisonSmith85 Thank you, Harrison. I know it. üíì Once I kick this flu that‚Äôll help.
Yesterday as I received the endorsement. #thankyou https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG https://t.co/xdysTgrK96
No love for losing an hour...
Thank you to all those asking how they can help. A donation to my campaign through my site is the best as the liberal money machine is what I need to fight. Anything can help. It truly can.  https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@tico75 Then you better get around to unfollowing me.
@EyeLuvLesbians There is an unfollow button. But thank you!
@DickJaneComedy How tolerant. Great comedy.
A donation from anywhere in the nation is about more than sending me to Congress it‚Äôs about sending a message. Please see my site and anything can help! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@rodneyj36698832 Thank you. My site is easy to donate. Just click on contributions! Any little bit helps. I‚Äôm telling you it does and from any state! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
I‚Äôm fighting a battle against a major liberal money machine. I‚Äôm asking with all my heart for folks to help me build on this victory today to donate to my campaign because it‚Äôs triggering The Left who loves to paint me ‚Äúclueless.‚Äù https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@rjs2680 That next challenge is kicking this flu!
@AntonioSabatoJr Thank you and congratulations! I‚Äôm so happy!
@RepStevenSmith I want to thank God showing me I'm on the right path after wandering in darkness a long time.
@RepStevenSmith It's a powerful machine but time to break the wheel.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I am with Laura.
@MikeGNitevision ‚ù§Ô∏è
This first challenge was met by people like you who have contributed toward my fight. A lot more hurdles to leap. If you are able to donate, no matter what state you‚Äôre in, it helps. Believe me, it helps. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
You folks on Twitter got this news first. ‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄúThe votes and endorsement I received today makes me even more certain that I‚Äôm in the right party with my campaign to restore hope, faith and a better future for all our friends and neighbors in our 44th Congressional¬†¬†District.‚Äù (3) https://t.co/Lq2QJTlEZa
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy &amp; proud to have won my party‚Äôs endorsement in today‚Äôs election to be their candidate for Congress.‚Äù They agreed that everyone deserves a chance at the American Dream to have the opportunity for work, education &amp; a better life for themselves &amp; their families‚Äù (2) https://t.co/3MIfOzivj5

@mexicangirl6721 Better unfollow then.
While it's the weekend I'm still on duty. If anyone is able to donate toward my campaign, it would be appreciated. Twitter has done so much to turn out for support. It's a few clicks on my website: https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
@krzycarew On the road now with two bottles of water and conserving my voice for speeches today. Thank you! Water it is!
A crazy day ahead with the flu. Thank you all as I start the rounds. https://t.co/zaWYFA6jvp
@DearAuntCrabby Read my essays in context. They edited well. Be sure to ask Ari how he felt about that cheap shot. Business
This flu is horrible.
From my FB Page this morning. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG https://t.co/Rhi5SlCltP
@DrillbitTaylor2 Now there‚Äôs one hell of a typo. I did mean that ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AriMelber ‚ù§Ô∏è Ari. We played a nice game. #DashToDC Thank you for the call.
My site can take dmnatikns directly and with a few clicks it really helps. I am so thankful for the fantastic support so far and am grateful for whatever anyone in any state wants to do to help! https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG
This campaign is run on the help from people looking to change the status quo. Anything you could do to help me fight would be appreciated. https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG Asking for donations is far harder than going on MSNBC.
@JoanneMoore75 @AriMelber Time to toughen up.
@JackBastide And that‚Äôs why I chose MSNBC first out of the gate. Now we know the lay of the media land.
@PhilyWorkInjury @NKjaffe @AriMelber Read my recent post. Edited out of context. Because I‚Äôve never heard that one before. That joke is the equivalent of the office party drunk putting the lampshade on his head.
My official FB post that responds to my 1st interview on the campaign trail. Read and thank you as this campaign continues to Dash To DC! https://t.co/dfr8bm6Bwq
@brendapinnick @AriMelber Yeah. Editing works wonders because that‚Äôs never been used before. High concept.
I respect Ari and what he needs to do for a show. The jackals who buy into the edits and the ‚Äúclueless‚Äù thing as well as boxing me in to look racist and Nazi supporting...they‚Äôll all gloat. I was well aware of what I was walking into. Read my essays. It‚Äôs all there.
The bottom line is I‚Äôm making inroads and the opposition is rankled by the support I‚Äôve received. So enjoy the sound clips and edits. Fully expected and I still enjoy Ari.
Giving Ari the first interview for MSNBC was everything I expected and if you read my essays you‚Äôll see the left didn‚Äôt disappoint. Throw the bait, edit the clips, present to the masses. #Clueless
And there you have it, just as expected, the sound bites and of course the ‚Äúclueless‚Äù but as if I‚Äôve never addressed that before. The left side did well with all the cliches.
@pjohnson360 @california How tolerant
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber If anyone is looking for a meltdown or ‚Äúcrazy GOP‚Äù behavior, tune in elsewhere. This is about listening and the issues. If people aren‚Äôt going to listen then we won‚Äôt get anything done. #goodpeoplecandisagree
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber This was a wonderful interview because it‚Äôs a classic example of what happens when you don‚Äôt listen and all you wanna do is find problems and not discuss solutions. I‚Äôm about discussions on the issues not taking bait. #goodpeoplecandisagree Thanks for the coverage, Ari.
@itsmeCWB @TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Nope.
@LenPetersonJr While I have a breather on my own campaign trail, how is all of this legal on Amity Island? You can‚Äôt own the entire island!
Papers filed. Gear up, folks. Off we go. Ok to the next stop for the day! I‚Äôll have a lot to report over next few days. Thank you all. #DashtoDC https://t.co/il68js2gLA
@cinderellasoils Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
The media has tried to paint an issue between myself and Mayor @AjaLBrown . I have no issue with this wonderful woman and the incumbent should be watching. Glad I could help to open the race up.

@peterjhasson His money is what I'll be fighting in my race.
@kingotyre I came from nothing. I got some success and I squandered a lot of success. I've been arrogant and then humbled. Failure is an incredible sculptor.
@kingotyre So many have been through the trenches. We need to enter a time where the trench warfare ends and we all live above ground, in the light with hope and stability.
I am so thankful for the veteran support for my campaign. Vets in my district or vets across the nation...you aren't forgotten. I can't do enough for our vets. #ThankYou
Running this campaign on a grass roots level has its positives and negatives. My platform and plan outlines for the district will be debuting asap. I wanted it up a few days ago but I am going through it to ensure everything is clear and accurate.
@BigDink_DLA Thank you. Party is never above people.
@carcarius Thank you.
@BigDink_DLA Let me tell I am for the people as I am one of the people. The media paints me as some clueless out of touch celebrity. I live in the district and have for some time and I want to be part of the solution. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 I can! Thank you!
A number of announcements will be going out this week. I‚Äôm excited to debut my platform and most of all thankful for the strong show of support for my running! #blessed

@ASAPDORIS I would love to. I‚Äôm down with flu now and it‚Äôs a busy week as I‚Äôm launching and doing this campaign basically as a one woman show. However let me get things in order and I will gladly accept your invite. I‚Äôll reach out privately to exchange information. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@ASAPDORIS Afraid of what I might bring? You mean dialogue? Ideas? Listening? Suggestions for proposed solutions? What‚Äôs there to fear in that?
@ASAPDORIS First of all she‚Äôs not running against ME in the particular sense. 2nd I‚Äôll be there to talk with everyone and hope you‚Äôll turn out, introduce yourself properly and respectfully and I‚Äôll gladly answer your questions.
@harperbulletin @cnsnews @newsbusters @WashTimes @theMRC @RichNoyes I could give him a run on that. üòâ

I live in the 44th district. I‚Äôm not the Beverly Hills celebrity the left media paints me to be. Every day is a struggle and I‚Äôm not the ‚Äúfired‚Äù FOX politico. I‚Äôm pushing for real change and without a money machine.
Fighting a bout with the flu last two days. Thank you all for the record amount of support coming in. It‚Äôs truly humbling and I‚Äôm appreciative!

@regulator recently said I don't live the life or know the struggle. While I disagree, he also was a gentleman and class act  &amp; said he doesn't know me. I publicly offer the invite to have that chance and to meet face to face and rectify that &amp; hear my plans.
So, you are encouraged to march to your own music, step to your own beat, unless it upsets the viewpoints of those people in the room last night? Again, no issue with Zendaya. The issue is for those listening.
Zendaya's #Oscars speech was beautiful &amp; I have no problem with her words. However for the wealthy elite in the bubble room last night it was them saying what they want to hear. Listen to her &amp; ask, why is a conservative voice in liberal H-Wood vilified? https://t.co/uROLcY7hQM
@JDBurrough California
The liberal end wants to bait me into a war of distraction with the Trevor Noah stuff. That doesn‚Äôt help the people of the 44th District. So let wealthy liberals throw empty gestures to people making a living. I‚Äôm going to run for office and do something.
https://t.co/5b4sBqCvTp
@Trevornoah has obviously never been to the 44th District of he would know the demographics of the people that live there. This all part of the democratic liberal line to smear a conservative stance. If you could donate to my campaign, this is part of what I need to fight.
Here‚Äôs another reason why I am running and need your donations and help. Read this article: https://t.co/5b4sBqCvTp

My friend &amp; filmmaker @HarrisonSmith85 rented a generator to ensure @DeathHouseMovie special screening goes in despite a terrible winter storm on the east coast. If you‚Äôre in the Poconos Sunday 3/4 go! Here‚Äôs the info: https://t.co/wHLSerifQr
@legalenglish111 Thank you. Anything will help!
@GeraltOfAmerica @Trevornoah Thank you. This is exactly what I am talking about. Thank you so much.
Thank you to all of my new followers &amp; those who have been with me so long. I need to ask for donations and hope everyone can help. Heck, if each of my followers donated 5 bucks each, that would do it. You can do it through my site: https://t.co/TKW9zbWlxG Thank you so much. https://t.co/PyAppq44DG
@MikeMason830 @Trevornoah Thank you. üíì
@AgathaC80 Sure will and feel free to unfollow.
@JonaMacaw @Trevornoah I can't agree with either of those things, Jonny. Trevor has every right to say what he wishes, but he should know his responsibilities to report it factually. Thank you for your support.
