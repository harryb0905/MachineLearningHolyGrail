@roseveleth Kidding! (also not kidding)
@roseveleth Heh, um ... journalists üò¨
@drktsciencelady Hah -- yep ... especially hard when so many people in different generations have the same names. Thanks for sharing the story with your students.
@jgots @JohnZibell @tomwaits Also their love of the hot water is real...because it feels incredible. And they drink it, even when it's warm out, which amazed me:  Definitely felt like they knew something I didn't know about why you'd want to drink nearly boiling water that smells like rotten eggs
@JohnZibell Hah ... It's been my pic for ... um ... ?? years .. (Since Twitter started!) ... should probably update it at some point, but ... you nailed it, hard to one up it.
@jgots @JohnZibell @tomwaits Also I still highly recommend seeing them ... they're amazing creatures.
@jgots @JohnZibell @tomwaits Sorry #buzzkill ... but they're still awesome.
@jgots @JohnZibell @tomwaits Those locations="monkey parks" where people pay to watch monkeys (who are wild, but come to the parks by choice because there's food for them). Humans aren't allowed in those springs but there are springs for humans right outside the parks and monkeys sometimes sometimes get in
@jgots @JohnZibell @tomwaits They don't naturally bathe like this. This species exists all over Japan but they only get in the hot springs in certain locations because humans taught them to do it there generations ago as a tourist attraction, and the monkeys have taught their offspring to do it ever since
@jgots @JohnZibell @tomwaits Hah. Well ... they mostly ignore humans unless you do something they perceive of as aggressive (like looking them in the eye) but the biggest reason to not get in the springs with them is that they carry things that can make you v sick or kill u (like Herpes B, various parasites)
Oh how I love this: 'Lord Mayor Cleo Lake removed portraits of slave owners from her office, replaced them with a portrait of #HenriettaLacks ‚Äúwhose immortal cells have impacted the whole world ... so surely today she is worthy of celebrating‚Äù https://t.co/Y5XujaAGrG #HeLa
@HollyLynchez Well, except a) in the piece that analogy was used by a prof illustrating general idea of informed consent/privacy &amp; b) the OpEd made clear the distinction between identified vs de-ID'd, &amp; the fact that there's debate over whether DNA can actually be de-identified in long haul
@chngin_the_wrld Yes! Thank you! I hadn't seen it ... glad to know about it.

@davebrewerx Working fine for me - may have just been a momentary glitch from traffic. Thanks
@DocBanks84 Whether u feel that's ethical depends on whether u think people should b asked before their tissues=stored for research. Many do, many don't
@DocBanks84 They do IRB review for using tissues, but most would get waiver &amp; not require IRB because samples=anonymized https://t.co/5nsd5Att8z
@DocBanks84 Some departments may choose to use more detailed consent - its common for them to vary, but not seeing those.
@DocBanks84 Looks like SOP=general statement saying may save tissue.That's more than legally required but less than many do.No specific informed consent https://t.co/Jr1ZiYjX9A

@Larryferlazzo Those Oakland kids blew me away.  It's hard to rhyme "epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix stage 1" let alone do it to a beat!
@Larryferlazzo (i.e. that it's not just about Henrietta's cells being taken in the 50s, but also about her children being used in research)
@Larryferlazzo The Oakland students really grasped+conveyed story's full ethical range in a fabulously concise and accessible way...

@zoefinkel Hah -- done!
@Burhanco good to know! Vet said infection is a worry - got some antibiotics.
@lisamjarvis hah. This is true. The rodents there are all very identifiable.

@jessicablois good to know! Thanks. It wasn't behaving rabies-odd &amp; dog is current on vax. Wonder about lepto/distemper/plague in this area
@jessicablois yes, Bay Area. That looks right! Now to figure out what diseases to test it for...Was in process of dying when dog got it #RIP
@JoshRosenau California, Bay Area. It's bigger than a standard lab rat -- kinda squirrel sized
@jessicablois hah. Maybe small chinchilla sized ... Definitely way bigger than a house mouse or domestic rat.
@jessicablois yeah it's like the size of a squirrel maybe a little smaller

@popegoodpope  @bronwendickey ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate German Shorthair Pointers, or even THOSE GSPs.  My feelings about their owner?  Very different‚Ä¶

@JenetAllDay @andrewmseaman @BronwenDickey yes, that, &amp; also the #PitBull hate is literally tied to race/class because historically ...
@jenetallday @bronwendickey @newsobserver Exactly! Me too.

@Lewis_Lab It no regs prohibiting re-ID in this context, no penalties etc.  See the work of @erlichya https://t.co/w7lRwfmJly
@mbeisen ...some oppose them because they want the status quo, others because they don't like the way they're written -- much complexity (5)
@mbeisen Some oppose the *way* these regs would get to the consent requirement (by calling all biospecimens "human subjects" (4) ... so ...
@mbeisen There's wide agreement that it's weird any changes would apply to all biospecimens but not all genetic information (3)
@mbeisen some oppose b/c they say broad consent isn't really consent, and removing IRB review post broad consent decreases protections (2)
@mbeisen Some oppose b/c not reading them (like they think they'd have to get consent for previously stored, which are grandfathered) (1)
@mbeisen In that lawsuit, plaintiffs quoted: ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôd only asked me for permission, I would have said yes‚Äù https://t.co/DTSN62pB7i
@mbeisen If not asked, there's evidence they will destroy valuable samples. This is 1 of several such cases https://t.co/qlvaDleu8d (2)
@mbeisen Common argument: requiring consent for tissues will decrease access to samples. There's evidence 75-85% of people will say yes (1)

@erlichya ... Thinking maybe they'd be able to benefit from Henrietta Lacks Foundation. A noble thought but still big questions re ethics

@MichelleNMeyer @erlichya @DrMiguelPerales @cshperspectives mostly just to share their stories &amp; their experiences reading #HeLa ...
@TheWackademic @erlichya @DrMiguelPerales @cshperspectives many have asked me about that one, among others. No 1 knows from what I've seen
@erlichya @DrMiguelPerales @cshperspectives but most sources of commonly used cell lines didn't know lines were created, so can't reach out

@MattSchlichting Hah. It's no "weird girls" but still pretty gr8. Was in a random alley I didn't mean to walk down in Bucktown. Glad I did
@writehandmedia yep. Tried searching to see if I could figure out what it was from, what it meant, generally WTF, but ... Nothing.

@Barry_Yeoman also, for the record, most of those words are probably going to get deleted. But still. :-)
@amy_harmon @stevenbjohnson no idea if that made any sense :-)
@amy_harmon @stevenbjohnson ...that shows me the structure via meta view of quick descriptions of what's in each section the cards represent
@amy_harmon @stevenbjohnson then I write the full text in the notebook. when I want to look at overall structure I go to index card view...
@amy_harmon @stevenbjohnson I write summaries of the text on the index card - like an actual index card you'd use for organizing...

@DogSpies Yes, hysterical sitters! 1st laugh after her surgery was when I visited ER &amp; she was sitting in her usual funny way in that pic
@mattrussell_PhD I feel for you. That‚Äôs the hardest. Rhoda went for a 2 mile run the night before, ate big breakfast, all normal, then this.
@TheMichaelBusby Yep, that too ‚Äî the chemicals in many dog toys have already been linked to cancer in humans
@mattrussell_PhD ack, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. Such a hard thing. Peace and healing back at you.
.@DogSpies Thanks ‚Äî definitely feel lucky right now. She‚Äôs feeling great, has no idea anything is wrong, which is as good as it can be.
@TheMichaelBusby All valid questions!
@BrianPardy Now we‚Äôve started treatment (chemo + experimental therapy) &amp; I feel like found best possible option+she feels great, which helps
@BrianPardy I did nothing but sit on couch with her researching and talking to experts for 1st 10 days after diagnosis‚Ä¶
@BrianPardy Hah, yeah. Having worked in vet med for years, I‚Äôve been on both sides of that ‚Äî needing the meds &amp; wanting to give the meds‚Ä¶
@GencoFilms The pooch, see previous post re her diagnosis and a PSA
@TheMichaelBusby I‚Äôll probably write a stand alone article about some of this stuff before my book, will post for sure
@DogSpies Thanks!
@BrianPardy Oh yay! Luv to hear that. Thx. Pulling for Rhoda to buck the stats &amp; b 1 docs refer to years later when giving hope 2 others :-)
@TheMichaelBusby True. Horrible irony: I was already writing about that for my next book/articles, research on hemangiosarcoma specifically

@BrianPardy Absolutely! IMHA was one of my worries when I saw her gums, that‚Äôs a very tough diagnosis too. So sorry u went through that
@TheMichaelBusby I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶nasty nasty disease. I‚Äôm working to find new/experimental treatments, will write about it 2 hopefully help others

@mattizcoop agreed--definitely hedges. But I think they'd squeak by on that one. I wonder if they did that bc hadn't figured out exact dates
@Boas72 article actually said "more than 11 years" -- probably hadn't yet figured out actual time to the day so went w/that to be safe.
Interesting: That original 1853 article spelled Solomon's name differently in headline vs main article #12YearsASlave http://t.co/olPwzyP0n8
@mattizcoop actually, just re-read it and it says *more than 11 years* so that part isn't technically wrong. But the name misspelling is
@mattizcoop would kinda love to see a correction now ... oldest correx ever issued
@mattizcoop Ditto. I wonder if they ever noticed.

@mkonnikova it‚Äôs shocking that u even need to point that out to them. A correction is a pretty standard thing in terms of wording
@mkonnikova they need to make it clear that the sentences before are in error and the parenthetical = correction
@mkonnikova as it is the error is still there &amp; parenthetical seems to question whether the actually does what it says.
@mkonnikova they need to replace the word ‚Äúwhile‚Äù with the word ‚Äúcorrection.‚Äù That would = correcting the error.
@mkonnikova if people read that BRCA test could cost them ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù or raise premiums they will assume health insurance (for good reason)
@mkonnikova no, that would imply health insurance. It‚Äôs best to be specific about what it does and doesn‚Äôt impact.
@mkonnikova @Salon didn‚Äôt include the word ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù at the start of the parenthetical, so it‚Äôs now just confusing &amp; still incorrect
@mkonnikova @Salon It‚Äôs good that they added the into but they didn‚Äôt correct the error. They left the misinformation &amp; (cont‚Äôd)
@mkonnikova @Salon Rather than just deleting it, are they affixing a correction that explains the error to fix previous mis-info?
@mkonnikova @Salon Glad to hear it. Tho why not fix it 1st time u asked rather than 3rd? 24 hrs=long time for error like this to propagate
.@Salon Genetic Info Nondiscrimination Act=illegal for health insurers to deny/change coverage bc of genetic info http://t.co/UDpjgUHXMy
.@Salon The longer that error is live the more people will b misinformed &amp; given incorrect reason to fear BRCA test. Please issue correction
(cont‚Äôd) @Salon Story says + BRCA test=&gt;losing health insurance/higher premiums. Not true. That would violate fed law http://t.co/3nGF9HJ6VZ
Really? I noted major/dangerous error in @mkonnikova‚Äôs BRCA @Salon story &gt;24 hrs ago; still not corrected though author asked Salon to fix?
@paperhaus @susanorlean will said task rabbit friend come to Chicago too?  I‚Äôm thinkin task-wise, that‚Äôs probably a bit too big
@mkonnikova Dismayed @Salon still hasn‚Äôt fixed that error. The longer it‚Äôs up the more damage it does re spreading dangerous misinformation
@IAMLILDAY It‚Äôs moving. I was just in LA for a week talking with the producers about the screenplay ‚Ä¶ more news soon I hope.
@IAMLILDAY Here's the story behind it http://t.co/nHH6ekSg4o
@IAMLILDAY Yep, they didn't give the family or Henrietta credit, which made a lot of people unhappy.  Episode here: http://t.co/ie0VAXEKCe
@IAMLILDAY Heh, me too! And when it was on Jepordy (pic here: http://t.co/NEzVjFqY3d) &amp; Law &amp; Order did an episode on her - u see that?
@Ladyzluvdakid Hey! See these?Henrietta in songs:JJ DOOM https://t.co/qioWShrbGB &amp; C+C Music Factory/FreedomWilliams https://t.co/dwCMEYJ7rM
@IAMLILDAY Henrietta‚Äôs in this one too, from JJ DOOM: https://t.co/qioWShrbGB
@IAMLILDAY Hey Davon:hope all‚Äôs good. U see this: ‚ÄúGood Morning Henrietta Lacks‚Äù by Freedom Williams? Have a listen: https://t.co/dwCMEYJ7rM
@mkonnikova @Salon @mary_carmichael I hope u‚Äôll include a correction notice to clarify for those confused rather than just editing sentence
@mkonnikova My pleasure - glad it‚Äôs getting fixed.
@mkonnikova Definitely - there‚Äôs much misinformation out there re what can and can‚Äôt happen bc of genetic info, don‚Äôt want to add to that.
@mkonnikova Life insurance can be impacted as can long term care, but not health insurance. http://t.co/UDpjgUHXMy
@mkonnikova There=an error in ur @Salon BRCA story: it's illegal for insurance companies to alter premiums/deny coverage bc of genetic info
Remember C+C Music Factory/Freedom Williams (EVERYBODY DANCE NOW!)? He did a #HeLa song:Henrietta Lacks Good Morning https://t.co/dwCMEYJ7rM
@susanorlean and speaking of evangelizing, I‚Äôm now totally hooked on task rabbit #thankyou
@susanorlean I told u u‚Äôd get hooked and start evangelizing! I tried to convince a total stranger to buy a tread desk today #weird
@craigtimes @exlarson I know they‚Äôve wiped out most birds, but seems there are still other animals around that might eat the mice
#whatcouldpossiblygowrong ‚Äú@settostun other snake poison option was beef cubes laced w mouse "decomposition extracts" http://t.co/5vVUxQHsgy
Exactly ‚Äú@mwikramanayake: @RebeccaSkloot And how many other animal species like having mice for dinner is what I want to know?‚Äù
Dead poison-laced mice dropped on Guam from helicopters to kill snakes. #whatcouldpossiblygowrong #animals http://t.co/mcBQO3YEen
