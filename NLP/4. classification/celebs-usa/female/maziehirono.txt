From committing to 100 percent renewable energy, to embracing a carbon neutral economy, Hawaii has taken aggressive action to combat climate change because of the threat it poses to our way of life.

Donald Trump needs to face the reality that he won’t get $5 billion for his wall and accept responsibility for keeping the government running.
But at the 11th hour, Donald Trump succumbed to pressure from his far right-wing base and chose to shut down the government for a $5 billion down payment on his vanity wall. This shutdown is totally unfair, completely unnecessary, and entirely the President’s fault.
Two nights ago, the Senate did its job by passing a bill to keep the government open with the expectation that the House would pass it and that the President would sign it into law.
These last two days have felt like we've been on a roller coaster with @realDonaldTrump at the controls. The Senate did the responsible thing by keeping government running—only to have President Trump get all worked up by some right-wing loud people yelling at him on Fox News. https://t.co/KCsk8rSwM9

I asked Patricia what she hoped life in the US would hold for her and her daughter. She just smiled, and that said everything. Remember Patricia and her smile. This administration will continue its cruel and inhumane treatment of these families, and we have to fight back.
At the end of our visit to Dilley, we were able to speak with Patricia, who has been here with her daughter for six months—much longer than DHS is legally allowed to detain minors. They crossed the border fleeing gang violence in Honduras.
Yesterday, we visited two family detention centers in Texas—Dilley and Karnes. DHS watched us closely throughout our tour, but what we were able to see was disturbing. They are herding families who are fleeing unspeakable violence into these internment camps.

George HW Bush dedicated his life to serving our country and the American people. My thoughts and aloha are with the entire Bush family today.
Cohen’s guilty plea makes clear that @realDonaldTrump's business dealings with Russia extended to the time close to the 2016 election. Another reason for Trump’s positive attitude toward Putin and why the Mueller investigation must go forward unimpeded.
This vacancy has remained open so long because of Republicans’ refusal to confirm qualified minority women, and their insistence on filling it with a man whose career is filled examples of his using the law to advance a racist, obstructionist, plainly un-American agenda.

Happy Thanksgiving from my ohana to yours! Hope that everyone is able to celebrate with friends and family.
Without exception for President Trump’s allies, principal officers who report directly to the President must be subject to a hearing and confirmed by the Senate.
We want the court to make clear that the Senate must confirm Matthew Whitaker’s appointment as Acting Attorney General—otherwise this temporary appointment violates the Constitution’s Appointments Clause.
.@SenBlumenthal, @SenWhitehouse, and I just filed suit to challenge @realDonaldTrump's unconstitutional appointment of Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General. Donald Trump cannot subvert the Constitution to protect himself and evade accountability.
Today I renewed a request for Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee. We should be doing our job to make sure he can do his, with the assurance the Department of Justice will enforce the law regardless of who breaks it. https://t.co/TLjYpS4z8T
This Veterans Day, we are reminded of the bravery and commitment of the men and women who have served and are still serving our country. As we recall their courage and strength, we must also ensure that their acts of valor are appropriately recognized.
Robert Mueller has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate 4 times for 3 DOJ positions. He doesn’t require Senate confirmation now, but @realDonaldTrump’s ignorant comments make passing bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel’s investigation even more important.
Today, we mourn with yet another community affected by a mass shooting. My thoughts and aloha are with #ThousandOaks. #EnoughIsEnough
Our next AG must not only commit to the completion of the Special Counsel’s investigation without interference, but also to preserve the independence of DOJ &amp; its law enforcement agencies, enforce our nation’s laws fairly, &amp; safeguard the civil and voting rights of all Americans.
The President’s actions today make it even more critical that Congress passes bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel’s investigation.
In a direct move to undermine the Mueller investigation, @realDonaldTrump forced Jeff Sessions to resign. I am concerned that the Mueller investigation will now be overseen by Acting AG Matthew Whitaker – someone who has raised some troubling views about the investigation.

The 14th Amendment confers U.S. citizenship to persons born in the United States. To incite his base, @realDonaldTrump wants to change the Constitution by fiat. Ours is a country governed by rule of law and Donald Trump is not king.
For @realDonaldTrump’s information: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside” - The 14th Amendment of the U. S. Constitution
My thoughts and aloha are with the Tree of Life Synagogue community and the families of the victims of today’s senseless attack in Pittsburgh. We need to join together to fight against reckless hatred and this epidemic of gun violence
We live in a very polarized time, but as Americans we need to come together and send a clear message that violence and incitement have absolutely no place in our politics.
I’m grateful that federal, state, and local law enforcement are working with a sense of urgency to identify and apprehend those responsible.
I join our entire country in condemning the concerted attacks on President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Attorney General Holder, Congresswoman Waters, George Soros, and CNN.
Here's the thing-- Mitch McConnell is gaslighting us. Republicans rammed through a bill to give huge tax breaks to corporations and the mega-rich, and now they're using its consequences as an excuse to propose cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. It's all part of the GOP fever dream.
Today’s Judiciary Committee hearing, held during an extended recess to consider highly controversial nominees, is completely unprecedented. @chuckgrassley and @senatemajldr continue to do everything they can to pack our courts with dangerous, anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ judges.
@realDonaldTrump Congress should take action to protect these children and their families by passing my Fair Day in Court for Kids Act which would provide legal representation to all unaccompanied children during their immigration court proceedings.
Now, @realdonaldtrump and his administration are proposing new ways to continue this barbaric practice by forcing families to choose between indefinite detention or family separation.

As I said during the hearing, this is why the #MeToo movement is so important, because often in these situations, there is an environment where people see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. That is what we have to change.
It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible and I believe her.

Here are Judge Kavanaugh's own words on Native Hawaiians. In Rice v. Cayetano, he drew conclusions based on these factually wrong and incredibly offensive claims. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/jiWY9pEZwk
Judge Kavanaugh continued to evade answers on whether or not women have a fundamental, Constitutionally-protected right to an abortion. But his extreme dissent in Garza v. Hargan tells us all we need to know. He would be the key vote on weakening or overturning Roe #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/nwl8pAG4Ei
In 1999, Judge Kavanaugh wrote an op-ed and amicus brief that disparaged the Native Hawaiian community. He wrongly asserts that Native Hawaiians are not an indigenous community. I won't let that stand. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/6sc0vNRyNu
Last December, 15 brave women came forward and shared their stories of sexual assault and harassment by Alex Kozinski, a mentor of Judge Kavanaugh's. Judge Kozinski's behavior was an open secret, yet Judge Kavanaugh said he saw nothing, heard nothing, and obviously, said nothing. https://t.co/jdzIQ69bev

.@fred_guttenberg It was an honor to meet you today. I’m sorry Judge Kavanaugh can’t say the same.

No matter what Chairman Grassley claims, Judge Kavanaugh himself said that his years as White House Staff Secretary were the "most interesting and in many ways among the most instructive" to his experience on the bench. And they are hiding those records from the American people. https://t.co/PQPmfGm6Ju
Judiciary Committee Republicans made an unprecedented demand that Democrats pre-clear the questions, documents, and videos we would like to use at the #KavanaughHearing.   Now the Chairman says he doesn't have an answer.  Well I do—no.   #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/eMlPDFtfsM

I have cancelled my meeting with Judge Kavanaugh. @realDonaldTrump, who is an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal matter, does not deserve the courtesy of a meeting with his nominee—purposely selected to protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole.

The U.S. Senate and the American people deserve to see what Brett Kavanaugh wrote and said about important policy matters, including torture, health care, reproductive rights, environmental regulation, workers’ rights, and more while he served as George W. Bush’s right hand man.
.@senjudiciary Republicans are trying to bulldoze their way through what should be a careful process to fulfill our Constitutional role to provide advice and consent by examining a nominee’s entire, relevant record.
In normal times, there wouldn't be any question that the Committee is entitled to see Brett Kavanaugh’s record from his entire service in the Executive Branch, including as WH Staff Secretary. Refusing this request only clarifies that GOP is concerned about what we might find. https://t.co/Nvd5RH6Udr

Mr. Bounds tried to hide these disparaging writings from his judicial selection committee, but they were brought to light by a 3rd party. That’s why it’s important to see all relevant documents from a nominee’s life and career. You never know what you’ll find. #ReleaseTheRecords
In college, Ryan Bounds wrote awful things about race relations, LGBT rights, and labor rights. That’s why his home-state Senators opposed him, and the Senate did the right thing today by not voting on his nomination.
I think you meant to write "the higher ends of *Russian* intelligence." https://t.co/m7b0njXz6U
The Senate just voted to confirm Ryan Bounds and Andrew Oldham- 2 more of President Trump's ideologically driven judges who were vetted by the Heritage Foundation &amp; the Federalist Society.

Putin and Trump standing side by side, both misleading their countries and the world. Birds of a feather do, indeed, flock together.
With Russia shooting cyber missiles at our country, @realdonaldtrump does nothing except side with Putin against our own intelligence and law enforcement community.  Advantage, Putin
A POTUS who continues to call the Russia investigation a witch hunt—despite indictments against 32 people including Russian nationals with ties to Putin—will not confront Putin with the truth. @realDonaldTrump continues to put his personal interests above protecting our democracy

No one should forget that @SenateMajLdr changed Senate rules for the expressed purpose of confirming Donald Trump’s ideologically-driven nominees with the barest majority rather than the 60 votes required for previous Supreme Court nominees.
Kavanaugh has advocated that Congress legislate to exempt U.S. presidents from civil and criminal actions while in office. This is of deep concern at a time when Donald Trump is a defendant in numerous civil lawsuits and is the subject of a significant criminal investigation.
As a federal appellate court Judge, Kavanaugh’s record is replete with decisions favoring the privileged and powerful. His writings &amp; rulings show a determination to restrict reproductive freedom &amp; strip federal agencies of their power to protect our water, air, and safety.
.@realDonaldTrump selected Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court from a list hand-picked by two organizations with a far-right ideology —the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh has not earned the benefit of the doubt. He has the burden of proof to demonstrate his ability to be independent of @realDonaldTrump and exercise unbiased and independent judgment. #WhatsAtStake (thread)

Andrew Wheeler is a former fossil fuel industry lobbyist and shares Mr. Pruitt’s hostility to the EPA’s core mission of protecting the air we breathe &amp; the water we drink. He is another wrong choice to lead this critically important agency on either an interim or permanent basis.
Scott Pruitt exemplified the toxic mixture of corruption and hostility to government we’ve come to expect from the Trump administration. I joined 38 other Democratic Senators in calling for his resignation in April, and I certainly welcome his long-overdue resignation today.

Should there be hearings, I will exercise my Constitutional duty to determine whether any nominee appointed will respect the law, the Constitution, and American values.
Donald Trump has vowed that the Supreme Court should always remain Republican. The Supreme Court should be above politics, qualified, and exercise fair and independent judgment.
A nominee that is intent on carrying out the right-wing ideology of the President and his most extreme supporters.
If the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court is anything like the nominees he’s been sending to the lower federal court, I expect that we will see a nominee hand-picked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.
The Court’s decision continues an assault funded by far-right groups on working people. We must fight back. Joined by my Senate and House colleagues, I’ll be introducing a bill to establish the right of every public sector employee to join a union and bargain collectively.
The partisan, political decision from the Supreme Court in #Janus will undermine public sector unions’ ability to fight for these basic protections for the 17.3 million public employees they represent.
America’s public sector workers teach and nurture our children, keep us safe, and care for our families. As #union members, they are empowered through collective action to fight for fair wages and work conditions.
.@realDonaldTrump's targeting of minority groups isn't a dog whistle. It's a bullhorn.
By ignoring the President’s clear intent to discriminate against Muslims, the Court handed the President unfettered power to continue to target minorities.
Today is a dark day for our country. Every time our country has singled out a minority group for discriminatory treatment, we have been proven very, very wrong. The Supreme Court’s decision in #TrumpvHawaii will be no different.

What’s happening to these children feels personal to me. Like so many people, I’ve found that my anger and emotions about this issue aren’t far below the surface.
Congress has a responsibility to repair our broken immigration system – and we tried hard in 2013 with months of hard work and bipartisan compromise. We cannot and should not enact a patchwork solution that enshrines Donald Trump’s hatred and fear of immigrants into law.
There is nothing in the law that requires a zero-tolerance approach at the border – it was a choice that Donald Trump and his administration made. And these children are suffering the consequences. The President’s actions are unnecessary and cruel – but they aren’t surprising.
The President of the United States and his administration are playing games with the lives of innocent children. Tonight, my colleagues and I are on the floor opposing family separation and detention. Watch live here: https://t.co/u0FNiF4gpT  #HandcuffsForAll

Neil Gorsuch's record before he got to SCOTUS provided a window into what he would do as a Justice. Acting as if the extreme positions of Trump nominees will not matter, or can be set aside by empty platitudes, makes the Senate a rubber stamp for @POTUS. #CourtsMatter https://t.co/QEQ363zP9C

I'm deeply concerned that @realDonaldTrump's violation of the Iran Nuclear Deal raises serious questions about whether the US can be trusted to uphold any agreements or negotiations it enters into, &amp; that this uncertainty will weaken our position in negotiations with North Korea.
This decision makes it less likely we will be able to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed power, and less likely that we will be successful in confronting, in conjunction with our allies, Iran’s other malign activities.
.@realDonaldTrump jeopardized our national security by unilaterally violating an international agreement whose compliance by all parties until now has effectively deterred the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. #IranDeal

@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley I will continue to fight back against President Trump and Majority Leader McConnell’s quest to pack the court with as many ideologically-driven nominees as possible.
@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley Hawaii is a great example of how this process should work. After extensive consultation with our delegation, the White House nominated two highly-qualified nominees for judicial vacancies in our state.
@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley But let’s not argue stats, let’s discuss what blue slips are really about: consultation with home state Senators to ensure judicial nominees in their states are highly qualified, understand the importance of applying the law fairly, and meet the needs of their communities.
@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley This is wrong. The Judiciary Committee has never held a hearing for a judicial nominee with 2 unreturned blue slips in the modern history of the Senate.
Disappointed to see Chairman @ChuckGrassley plans to hold a hearing for a judicial nominee to the 9th Circuit from Oregon without the consent of both home-state Senators. This has never been done before and should not happen now. These are not normal times.

If the President is going to shift our mission in Syria, he needs to come to Congress for authorization and explain exactly what his strategy is, and how it supports U.S. national security interests and ends the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe and refugee crisis.
I am deeply concerned by the President’s incoherent strategy in this critically important area of the world where there are layers of complexity and no easy answers.
While today's action was taken in concert with France and Great Britain, the President stated that ‘we are prepared for a sustained response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.’
Bashar al-Assad has again used chemical weapons against his own people. This is another atrocity and breach of international law, and the international community must hold him accountable.
The fundamental difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is the rule of law, and @RealDonaldTrump's actions make clear that he has no respect for the rule of law. That's why Congress must act to protect the Special Counsel's investigation. https://t.co/46EWooSQbe

The President chose to end DACA. The President chose to torpedo a bipartisan compromise to protect Dreamers. He created this mess. https://t.co/R9rSeN1x8g
With this threat, the President made it clear that he wanted all of us to stand with him against the Rounds-King amendment. That, I would not do.
President Trump created this crisis when he cancelled DACA and threw 800,000 young people under the bus. And with his recent veto threat, he has made it abundantly clear that protecting Dreamers is the farthest thing from his mind.
The Rounds-King amendment included a number of provisions I strongly oppose, including $25 billion for Trump’s wall. The Republicans also sought to dismantle our legal, family-based immigration system. Democrats fought hard to limit the damage.
Unfortunately, we were left with only one option to protect the 800,000 current DACA recipients and an additional one million Dreamers who the President has threatened with deportation. It’s for them that I voted for the Rounds-King amendment.
I have consistently supported a clean DREAM Act, and voted in favor of the Coons-McCain amendment today that came very close to it. And while it earned the support of a bipartisan group of 52 senators, the vast majority of Republicans blocked this effort.

I voted against this legislation because Dreamers are not included in it. An overwhelming majority of the public supports legislation to protect Dreamers, and Democrats will be fighting hard for them during the upcoming debate on immigration.
A lot of hard work and compromise went into this budget deal, which includes a number of provisions I strongly support. However, Dreamers were left out of the bill to allow this deal to go forward.
Throughout the debate on government spending, I have consistently supported efforts to fund critical domestic priorities without pitting groups against one another.

Self-serving and personal attacks against people who refuse to do his bidding reflect the narcissism of a man who has little regard for his responsibilities as President.  Sadly, for President Trump, it's all about him. Every time. All of the time.
Many of the Republicans investigating Trump-Russia appear more concerned with protecting the President than getting to the truth, this is particularly true in the House where almost nothing happens on the Intel Committee without the assent of the White House. #DefendOurDemocracy
Releasing a memo despite the FBI’s national security concerns shows how far Republicans will go to protect their lying President &amp; undermine Robert Mueller’s investigation.
.@realDonaldTrump's aversion to differences of opinion is pathological and does not serve our national interest or the interests of our allies in the region.
That the White House is no longer considering Victor Cha’s nomination over his legitimate concerns about preemptive military strikes against North Korea is deeply troubling and undermines ongoing diplomatic efforts to deescalate tensions.

Donald Trump's latest immigration salvo demonstrates an ego unbound by fairness, compassion, or understanding. It’s reminiscent of how he bullied and mistreated others in his business dealings.
Terms like "chain migration" and "illegals" continuously disrespect families like mine who came to this country in search of a better life.
There is no institution that Donald Trump's minions won't attack to protect their lying President. Going after the FBI to protect the President is reckless and unconscionable. https://t.co/mlynjHFpj9
There is no question that an open debate on immigration will be a knock-down, drag-out fight. There is an urgent need to protect DREAMers, and we can’t lose sight of this in the upcoming debate.
At the same time, Mitch McConnell promised on the Senate floor today that he would hold an open debate on DACA and immigration if no compromise is reached by the time this CR ends on February 8. We should all expect the Majority Leader to honor this promise.
My consistent position has been to oppose any continuing resolution that did not include these priorities. I voted against this CR for this reason.
I’m confident that we can reach bipartisan agreement on these issues and it was completely unnecessary for the President and Congressional Republicans to force a shutdown on them.
There are battles worth fighting. Protecting DREAMers, reauthorizing CHIP, funding Community Health Centers, and providing parity between funding for defense and domestic priorities – without pitting one against the other – were battles worth fighting.
Congress shouldn’t wait around for the President to make up his mind. Let’s do our jobs and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/zoLOjByI4y

McConnell &amp; Ryan want to wait for @realDonaldTrump, but we are a separate branch of government. Let’s do our jobs and end the #TrumpShutdown
Congress is a separate branch of government. Instead of bowing to the unpredictable, mercurial, and unreliable positions of the President, we should do our jobs and send the President a government funding bill that addresses all of these priorities.
Republicans are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. They are in charge of setting the time table and the agenda, and now they’re blaming the Democrats for their own misplaced priorities.
At the same time, they’ve ignored reauthorizing CHIP, funding Community Health Centers, protecting DREAMers, and providing parity between defense and non-defense programs. All of these issues have bipartisan support and should have gotten done months ago.
Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, &amp; Donald Trump turned things upside down. They’ve spent the past year working behind closed doors to take away health care from millions &amp; pass huge tax cuts for the richest people &amp; corporations in our country without input from Dems or the public.
The people, united, will never be defeated. We don't want a #TrumpShutdown, but we won't allow Republicans to pit vulnerable communities like these brave #Dreamers against each other. https://t.co/dkhyGPTqUY
It is a no-brainer. Let's do both. https://t.co/MVlAIvLgy8
The Senate is now in session &amp; @SenateDems continue to be ready to negotiate a bipartisan deal. But we will not pit kids against kids by allowing GOP to hold 9 million children who rely on CHIP hostage. #TrumpShutdown

This is a pivotal moment for Congress.

@PattyMurray @SecretaryZinke I couldn’t agree more @PattyMurray -  families in Hawaii rely on our clean shores and water for not only their livelihood, but our way of life. We must protect our coasts from Secretary Zinke and the Trump administration. https://t.co/tA2C5ATUBp

Your tax break: a few hundred dollars, then a tax hike. Trump’s tax break: $11 Million.  That’s bad math for families in Hawaii. https://t.co/tV2FqQn7w4
It is nothing more than a fulfillment of the Republican Party’s mission to eventually gut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest Americans and corporations. The American people will hold them accountable.
The Republican tax bill is a scam. After months of empty promises to the middle class, the President has been caught in another big fat lie. This bill will not help the middle class.
Tonight, the Senate is voting on the #GOPTaxScam- Donald Trump's big, fat lie to the middle class &amp; giveaway to the top 1% and corporations. https://t.co/l3bjuFYvRR
If you're in the top 1% of the wealthiest in our country, you'll do great under the #GOPTaxScam. The rest of us who have to work for a living will be screwed.
Boosting this in case you couldn't hear it over the noise of Republicans cheering about passing tax cuts for corporations &amp; the rich https://t.co/T7r0R8o3tU
I will vote against a CR that doesn't include the #DREAMAct, funding for CHIP &amp; CHCs, &amp; defense/non-defense parity. Instead of doing anything that would actually help people, Republicans want to give huge tax cuts to the rich. Talk about misplaced priorities.
Attacks from Trump allies &amp; the far right on the special counsel's investigation &amp; integrity invoke shades of creeping McCarthyism. We will continue to fight to allow Mueller's independent investigation to continue.

91% of Donald Trump's judicial nominees are white men. We need a diverse judiciary, not judges hand picked because they're #BadForWomen. #CourtsMatter
Donald Trump is appointing judges who are #BadForWomen to lifetime positions. Many have spent their careers advancing policies that would limit a woman's right to health care &amp; opposing LGBT rights, among other terrible things.

Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a domestic violence conviction is not called domestic violence – it's categorized as assault, which allows convicted abusers to buy guns.

But no longer. We can only create a culture where women are respected as equals if we all step forward and be part of the change by holding everyone, especially our leaders, accountable.
My hope is that this moment for a cultural change will result in women no longer being viewed as objects or toys, but recognized for their abilities and achievements. As regular human beings. Women have endured this behavior, which for too long has been ignored and tolerated.
We are, all of us, speaking out, naming names and demanding that the harassers take responsibility for their behavior. I am proud of each of the women who has come forward, and heartened by the changing climate that has received their stories with acceptance and compassion.
TIME Magazine, by naming ‘The Silence Breakers’ as their ‘People of the Year,’ is recognizing what women have always known: there are men among us who use their positions of power and influence to manipulate, harass, and assault women. What is new here is the women.
Today, I am calling on my colleague Al Franken to step aside. I’ve struggled with this decision because he’s been a good Senator and I consider him a friend. But that cannot excuse his behavior and his mistreatment of women. (thread)

Will the Court protect access to our justice system or slam the courthouse doors to all but the wealthiest among us? #SCOTUS
Will #SCOTUS protect the rights of working people &amp; our middle class or side with corporations who want to dismantle organized labor?

To my fellow activists: Keep the faith. Keep speaking out. Keep up your strength. And #RESIST
Never ever be deterred by someone like @realdonaldtrump who doesn’t realize American ideals are bigger than any one man, any one President
To all of you who have spoken out- never, ever be deterred by those whose smallness incites them to label you "Sad!"
The patience to understand change rarely comes quickly, yet with the urgency to never stop standing up, never stop speaking out
All an activist needs is an undying, unrelenting passion for America, faith in our shared ideals and what I call "patient urgency"
But you do not need to go to law school or serve in the Senate to be an activist.
Today, I am a US Senator. An activist passionate as ever about America &amp; the ideals @realDonaldTrump does not understand
We decided the best way to make change was to have a voice at the table. I went to law school &amp; got involved in @YoungDemsHI
Protesting the Vietnam War ignited my activism. Nixon's policies were wrong. But it wasn't enough to protest.
I came to this country as an immigrant from Japan. The young child of a single mother who arrived here with nothing but hope
My fellow activists: @realdonaldtrump calls you "Sad!" He wants to turn "Activist" into a dirty word, but I am proud to be an activist
If we don't speak out against this censorship now, we will be complicit in what comes next https://t.co/AeR2zWMUT0

I pressed @SenatorSessions for a commitment to defend Roe v. Wade in federal court. He again refused.
I asked @SenatorSessions if he would honor consent decrees that address police misconduct &amp; enhance accountability. He dodged the question
During his confirmation hearing, I pressed @SenatorSessions for a commitment to vigorously protect every citizen’s right to vote. He refused

6. How do we prevent Russia from interfering in future U.S. elections?
5. To what degree are Russian President Vladimir Putin or other high-ranking officials personally involved in directing these activities?
4. Did staff members of the presidential campaigns have any contact with Russian officials or Wikileaks during the campaign?
3. Was information leaked from both political party organizations equally – and if not, why not?
2. To what extent was information stolen from those computer systems disclosed?
1. To what extent were computer systems at U.S. national party committees compromised?
I support an independent, bipartisan Congressional inquiry that focuses on answering, among others, the following core questions:

Mahalo, @BarackObama for strengthening #EqualPay laws. Now it's our turn to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act #equalpayday2014
It shouldn’t have taken this long, but Senate finally voted to #RenewUI. House must act http://t.co/mzTpoY8cNn
In HI, women are earning about $7,700 less per year. We need to say #NoMadMenPay &amp; support #PaycheckFairness Act for #equalpay
Congress shouldn’t wait to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act &amp; close the wage gap on behalf of women and families. #EqualPay
Raising #minimumwage would allow 15,000 HI workers to stand on their own. Good for families #RaiseTheWage http://t.co/jqGMXW84mJ
Ridiculous that avg rent in HI is more than what a full #minimumwage worker makes in a year. #RaiseTheWage http://t.co/jqGMXW84mJ
Spoke about the need to #RaiseTheWage. 1 in 5 women in HI would get a raise if  #minimumwage = $10.10. http://t.co/jqGMXW84mJ

My mom raised our family on #minimumwage jobs, but it's harder today as the real $ value drops. That's why we must #RaiseTheWage
Full-time #minimumwage worker makes $14K/year, which leaves families across Hawaii struggling. It's way past time to #RaiseTheWage
More than 1/2 of #minimumwage workers are women working full-time. We must #RaiseTheWage http://t.co/x5Q6e5aLKG
Raising #minimumwage to $10.10 would help families across the country, including more than than 100,000 in Hawaii. #RaiseTheWage
@DearGirlProject my mom's example taught me that we can take risks and survive

What’s disappointing is counterproductive and politically-driven legislation when we should be working for #balanced #sequestration deal.
Not a bill that makes it easier for power plants to release mercury and other #toxic pollutants into the air.
That’s the type of energy bill I’d like to see http://t.co/Tx5ECf5Y
#Hawaii knows that key to #sustainable economy is renewable energy, respecting environment, and managing natural resources responsibly.
H.R. 3409 fails to take a #balanced approach to #cleanenergy and undermines laws protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink.

A strong economic foundation depends on a world class American #education system that prepares our country to compete in the STEM fields.
As an immigrant, I know the promise America offers and the hopes of those who come to our shores seeking a better life.
we don’t need to do it at the expense of the Diversity Visa Program.
While I believe we should be looking for ways to encourage the best and brightest to come to our shores and create American jobs...
Democrats and Republicans agree that we should establish a STEM visa program, but unfortunately Republicans inserted a poison pill.
Diversity visas provide a legal path for people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.
It follows the pattern of the Republicans’ approach of giving with one hand while taking with the other.
Unfortunately, the #STEMjobsAct isn’t the change we need.
in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields become victims of a broken visa system.
and the success of American businesses large and small. However, many foreign students who graduate from our best universities
The ability our nation to attract the world’s best and brightest has contributed greatly to the creation of American jobs...

Hawaii’s clean energy industries have generated over $1 billion in economic activity &amp; over 11,000 jobs, but we have a long way to go.
