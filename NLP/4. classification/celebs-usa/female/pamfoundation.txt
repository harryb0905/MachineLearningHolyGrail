Thoreau reminds us,  begins when we finally choose to critically examine and then recalibrate the ill-serving codes and conventions handed down to us,  often unquestioned,  by the past and its power structures.  It is essentially an act of the imagination first.

The children protesting all across the globe - who are also calling for a Green New Deal - is an alarm call that we have to radically rethink and rebuild our econony and relation towards the planet, including nature and animals, if our children want to have a future at all.
@elevatefestival - so it seems, things are coming together...¬†üí™
What is unique, maybe is that a Croatian, an Austrian and a Canadian will talk about necessity of a Green New Deal here and now in Europe,  while on the other side of the Atlantic progressives are working hard to offer a complenetary program for the future of humanity
but everyone would get a share / dividend / of big companies which would need to go green completely.
to create billions of GREEN INVESTMENT, which would at the same time initiate a jobs guarantee, and something like a UNIVERSAL BASIC DIVIDEND - not universal basic income which comes from taxation.
The idea behind the GND is actually very simple, like the New Deal of Roosevelt, which lead to massive investments and job creation in the United States after WWII, ¬†the GND would relay on the state and major financial institutions (why not the IMF and the World Bank? )
instead of monoculturalism we would have agroecology, instead of big companies controling energy, ¬†we would have cooperatives...
- which we have today, ¬†from solar power to wind energy, from Artificial Intelligence to automation which could radically change transportation for instance, so that we wouldn't have polluting cars, diesel or fossil fuel, but only electric cars or trains for instance,
So the Green New Deal (GND) is not something completely new, I think we could say that the indigenous communities across the world had a Green Deal already for thousands of years, they just didn't have the necessary technology

And now Jobs - - jobs - jobs... the solution is not to say refugees are "stealing our jobs",  the solution is to create investment  and create jobs
It was clear Mrs Clinton wanted a war in Libya to clinch her candidacy. (‚ÄòA good war?‚Äù  Some say she even created the migrant crises -) Precisely, Hillary's war!  And Sarkozy (whose campaign was payed by Gaddafi, something like 7 m -  was just in french newspaper )
The solution -  instead of building walls and re-establishing borders, must be a European solution,  and then it is connected to: - foreign policy (arms sales from EU to regimes like Saudi Arabia),  which is leading to wars (or intervention in Lybia),  from where refugees come
So why oppose Kurz migration policy? Not only because it is nationalistic and anti-humanitarian,,  it is also not smart -  because it is not solving the problem of migration.  It is just "out-sourcing it", in the same manner the EU is "exporting" refugees to Turkey
As a result, there are two routes now (Northen and Southern), at the moment 20,000 refugees are stuck in Bosnia and Herzegovina alone
This was the Balkan Route (blue colour) ¬†which Sebastian Kurz closed:  Basically, he closed Austria to migration, and then Hungary, Serbia and others closed the borders, even Austrian army was policing at the Macedonian border https://t.co/5N0zsy32a3

The Gilet Jaunes are still on the streets.... You can think of them how ever you want, but it is certain that France's deep problems remain unresolved.  The costs of ecological transition shouldn't be payed by those who were already Europe's victims of austerity.
A JG- Bonjour Pamela ,  j'√©sp√®re que vous allez bien , ici ce mouvement prend beaucoup d'importance et les tentatives pour le discr√©dit√© sont l√©gion , nous avons tout de m√™me la d√©termination n√©cessaire pour continuer jusqu'au bout de nos convictions pour le bien de tous .
We have to remain firm on our principles and our beliefs.  Go on the ground.  See by ourselves. Understand what this is about.  People who voted for the extreme right, normal people,  are now far from horrible discourses  thanks to this movement.  We need to support them.
And when they see a few fascists -  easily recognizable -  they put distance  and go somewhere else.  They can't be more honest  than this.
But it isn't.  It is a very healthy in the overall.  Plenty of humanity.  There are Jews, Muslims, Christians... That are fighting for their rrights.  For more democracy.  More equality.  To be heard.  To feel recognized.  That's what my friends on the ground see every week.
As such,  those oligarchs have a big interest in trying to pretend  that the movement is dangerous.
But these people are very few.  and they take all the attention  because that puts the movement in jeopardy and helps defend the privileges of the oligarchs.
To be honest,  there is extreme right and fascists and antisemitits in this movement.  As it is a social movement,  which fights for the rights of the poor,  very dirty people try to get on board.
It could be dangerous to comment or get roped into an ‚Äòantisemitism" debate which is usually neverending  and goes in all wrong directions.
because it is certain that there indeed is antisemitism amongs Gilet Jaunes and Macron is now using it (the attack on French philosopher Finkelkraut) to undermine the Gilet Jaunes who are not antisemites -trying to portray the whole movement as antisemitism (which is wrong)
Ive been advised to stay out of the "anti-semitism" debate, because it is toxic - and that I might become a victim...
Re Gilet Jaunes -  The situation is pretty worrying on the ground,  Some right-wing  fascists among the Gilet Jaunes?  clashes with the left groups,  anti-semitism  and so on... https://t.co/eFgt2jRCIs

More importantly, how can a real national debate take place from top-down and not bottom-up, without the talking about all the topics, including the contempt for the poor by the French state itself?
At the same time when the "grand debate" was supposed to start, Macron announced he is keeping French troops in Syria, while his ex-security aide is in custody over misuse of diplomatic passport. So who is the one "screwing around", is it the #GiletJaunes or is it Macron himself?
President Macron launched a "national debate" about #GiletJaunes, but the first thing he does is to offend the working class by saying they are "screwing around". The contempt for the poor seems to be the only success of this "national debate" so far.

And, they are  entitled to take action against those who engage in violence and destruction-  but, these people still have right to be treated fairly and have sentences proportionate  and  not excessive.
It is the state responsibility to prevent violence  and properly manage  possible problems  in protests.
Obviously nobody should be prosecuted for taking part in protests.  However -   many people arrested are those for property destruction  and violence.
I don‚Äôt understand what the case against Juan Branco is. The French gov should not be able to arrest him for representation of protesters...

We should also help nonprofit sanctuaries, like The Elephant Sanctuary and the Performing Animal Welfare Society, that rescue and care for exotic animals but don‚Äôt sell or breed them.
Instead of supporting zoos, we should support groups such as the International Primate Protection League,  the Born Free Foundation, and other organizations that work to preserve habitats.
We will only save endangered species by saving their habitats  and by combatting the reasons people kill them,  not by breeding a few in captivity.
Most animals housed in zoos are not endangered, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats. In fact, it is nearly impossible to release captive-bred animals into the wild.  https://t.co/omkDYDuPR1

But- as among other stuff, Melenchon wants France out of the EU (!) and his left-wing nationalism is not really helpful...
Reforms such as wealth redistribution, fossil fuel disinvestment... Orbring back Jean-Luc Melenchon and his proposals: fight tax evasions, tax the rich more, transition to local produce based economy, reform current governance...
But honestly, his primary political skills are being able to wear a suit, and acting confidently. It should be obvious to anyone that current status quo won‚Äôt work. Neoliberal golden age is over! France and the world needs radical economic reforms not just these cosmetic changes!
He says he listens to the people!
As for Macron speech,  not sure what to say... he allegedly caved in but has he?  Has he really?

The most absurd thing of the deal: transition period can be extended to 31 December 20XX (article 132 of the deal)!!!
What‚Äôs dumb about Brexit deal? It solves nothing. It is worse than staying in. The UK has almost same obligations but no say in them. Go figure
Lexit= left wing reasons for leaving EU. It is used to deliberately distance people who wanted Britain to leave the EU for left reasons but didn‚Äôt want to be identified with right-wing Brexit narratives around immigration or nationalism.   Ppl like many of my friends
It would remove the threat of different parts of the UK being subject to separate regulations‚Äù. This is a must
Corbyn is asking for ‚Äúa new, comprehensive customs union with the EU, with a British say in future trade deals, would strengthen our manufacturing sector and give us a solid base for industrial renewal under the next Labour government, especially for our held-back communities.
If I were to negotiate the deal   I would ask the EU to realise that it‚Äôs model is unsustainable and that the UK is given a free hand to embark on social justice reform otherwise prohibited within the neoliberal EU framework
So.  Lexit is a left exit. Re- what Corbyn would do. üí™üèΩ By negotiating a Brexit for the people. That protects the ordinary person. üëç  Rexit is what they are doing.   Right wing exit.ü§™  #LexitNotRexit

The solution is not more Macron or more Salvini, the actually need each other and reinforce each other, the solution can only be a Pan-European awakening across borders and nationalities,which would be able to tackle the deep economic, social and ecological crisis of Europe today
What is happening in France these days is a European problem, in the same way that the anti-immigrant measures and slide towards a new form of fascism in Italy is a European problem.
Also  Mr. Salvini recently said that "Macron is a problem for the French", meaning what is happening currently in France with the Gilets Jaunes protests is something that concerns only the French. This is wrong.
the fear and insecurity in all segments of society, the daily attacks on refugees and migrants,  the deepening economic crisis...

just imagine a world where you can't eat "foreign recipes". It would be utterly boring!
Let‚Äôs remember that tomato souce originally came from Peru and that spaghetti is believed to have been brought from China during the journeys of Marco Polo.  So there is no Italian - or any - food without the influence of other cultures.
- The current xenophobia in Italy is reaching absurd and worrying levels, when for instance top Italian chef Vittorio Castellani was told not to use "foreign recipes" in his cooking TV show. I adore Italian food, but what is Italian -or any - food without "foreign influences"?

The true question is whether the disobedience can be constructive, what comes the day after, can the progressives in France, and all over the world, use this energy so instead of violence we have images of constructing equal and egalitarian societies?
And the answer is: it came from the rising tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor, between the politcs represented by Macron and the 99% who are fed up with inequality, not only in France, all over the world.
Instead of being hypnotized by the burning images, we have to pose the question where did it come from...?
I despise violence...but what is the violence of all these people and burned luxurious cars, compared to the structural violence of the French -and global - elites?

I‚Äôm the first to say I‚Äôm a naughty vegan. I do the best I can. Like I‚Äôm sure you do too.  I have leather shoes from the past and gifts from people. I‚Äôm careful with my food and I don‚Äôt wear fur or exotic skins and am reducing my vintage leather and do not by more ...
