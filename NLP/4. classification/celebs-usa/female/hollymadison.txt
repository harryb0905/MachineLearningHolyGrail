@russell_lynch if you were speaking to Hilary why did you tag me and not her?
@DianeStuffer the whole point of my last response to you was that Hilary is not what I am focusing on right now.
@russell_lynch yes. I have been sitting by my phone like a praying mantis waiting for the opportunity to get political 🙄
@karpoint71 anyone who has compassion thinks about the issues. Sorry ‘bout it.
@DianeStuffer we would all be better off if we focused on the issues and not the cults of personality in politics.
@AZLOVE71 but automatic weapons are on a whole different level IMHO
@AZLOVE71 actually, I grew up in rural Alaska with guns in my home. I am trained in self defense and own a gun myself.

Who remembers laser light shows? Do they still do those?
@Michellewvgirl don't you mean "to"?
@SavannahLeigh92 what is your point? I don't think a woman should be shamed for having a sex tape
@deehumorous the woman with the sex tape is not involved in the election. However, one person involved in the election shamed her.
@nancycar you agree a woman not involved in this election should be shamed?
@Calaha109 no, and I wouldn't expect my husband to answer for every decision I've made when applying for a job/running for office, etc. ✌🏻️
@lienemannla I know, I agree with you. I don't think he should have shamed her for it or brought it up in the first place.
@22klew the woman with the sex tape is not involved in the election. However, one person involved in the election shamed her.
Who cares if someone has a sex tape or not? #Debate2016
The #looming, though
@cbass1109 not discounting the scandals either, I would just prefer to hear about what candidates plan to do in office
@cbass1109 I don't hate Trump. I would just prefer to hear about how candidates will handle issues and not about the spouse's scandals.
@dhaunschild the point is she has listed MANY other reasons he is not fit to be president
Or play Oscar music RT @TanyaLV2: Why don't they just mute the microphones when it isn't your turn to talk? #debate
@Shainanicole I just don't agree that a woman should be held responsible for everything her husband has done.
@cbass1109 and your point is?
@Shainanicole I'm not saying I know
@canebuc2188 I think you meant "too"
Hillary should have brought #JaneDoe to sit front row.
