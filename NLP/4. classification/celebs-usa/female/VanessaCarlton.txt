So is Trump's nickname Donny Dope Trump? Like honestly guys his playground tactic of making up dumb names for people is actually something worth using against him. And no one does it. Please send options below. Cause Donny Dope ain't my best work.

Board and Trustees are the source of the problem. Here's a reminder if the important New Yorker Piece that should be read on @nycballet if you have not. https://t.co/HDdkHJI9NI
What’s interesting about Peter Martins &amp; R Kelley &amp; Ryan Adams is the people that surround them &amp; enable this kind of manipulation. Proximity to power makes some people lose moral strength. It takes a village. @nycballet board &amp; Balanchine Trust, you continue to enable. @nytimes
Martins went backstage &amp; took Ashley Bouder out of the role of Aurora. Presumably as punishment for she had been outspoken about his behavior. Being that you’re an outspoken #metoo-er I wonder what you think of this @sjp. After all you are a board member.  What are your thoughts? https://t.co/qH5LBg7qg2
⁦@nytimes⁩ The NYC Ballet Board is inept. They were put in place by Peter. They are aligned with him and continue to do his bidding. This is not ok. The board must step down. “Peter Martins Left City Ballet a Year Ago. But He’s Not Entirely Gone.” https://t.co/5EReiLdkjf

@LoriMMueller It seems it is reflective. We've read the accounts of multiple students. You've had a problem at this school for some time &amp; it has gone unaddressed until this photo leaked. The fact that it's taken this long to address points to a serious issue within the administration.

@barabooSD @LoriMMueller  I can't believe what I'm seeing. Every single one of those boys should be expelled. This school has failed them. In picking up the pieces you must take a close look as to how this hatred was able to grow in your schools environment. https://t.co/ThK7cp0fY1

I wonder if Trump knows what decorum means. I wonder if he knows that it is Latin in origin.  I wonder what happened to the moderate republican. Are you out there? You should be declared an endangered species.
I feel like Elon Musk right now. I’m taking it private.
Buzzed tweeting is REAL tweeting.
Any news that Trump deems “fake news” is news that hurts his feelings. This is a man that has been enabled all his life. He can only manage praise. Nothing else. We can’t let him take this country down.
Trump wants the level of press accountability equal to walking into a bar and ordering 12 beers and walking out without paying.

There are pillars of conservatism that I understand &amp; in cases agree with. There are republican ideas that make sense &amp; that I can see the logic in. Trump is a radical. He is not republican. Every person that supports him has thrown the Republican party under the bus.
Public announcement: One must always be loyal to their personal value system before their party. If one’s party falls out of line with one’s values it is ok to not vote along your party line.

Lindsay Graham has changed his twitter profile picture to a photo of him and Brett Kavanaugh. Im not joking. @LindseyGrahamSC you are on the wrong side of history here. Don't let the door hit ya on the way out.
I bet Kavanaugh is kicking himself for throwing his friend Mark under the bus like that. In addition, insinuating that Mark Judge is not a good person because he has addiction issues is the antithesis of having good character. In fact, Kavanaugh seems absent of a moral code.

Our Senator Bob Corker is leaning toward confirming Kavanaugh. His number is  202-224-3344.
100 percent. https://t.co/j8xVIkH0CG
Dr. Ford was able to keep it together like she did and SHE was the one assaulted, meanwhile, Kavanaugh could not keep it together and HE'S the one who is supposed to be one the most powerful &amp; measured judges in the country? Woman are beasts. Ford's strength is crushing.
Kavanaugh not wanting an FBI investigation implicates him. I believe his biggest fear is an interview between FBI &amp; Mark Judge. It is clear that if he is nervous about that which means he is guilty &amp; means he is perjuring himself. Also Grassley &amp; Graham are alarming humans.

@MadelineACamp @SecElaineChao Dana Loesch calling for Curb Stomping in comparison to Maxine's"calling people out" &amp; "pushing back on them" are in fact different.Dana's language led to 5 people being shot &amp; killed.Maxine's speech has led to college kids with back packs verbally calling out a senator. Ya know?
@coach_cmathews It is unacceptable from anyone, I agree. However Maxine's speech is on a completely different playing field. Have you watched the actual speech? Google is your friend. Have a great day!
@MadelineACamp Hi! im not sure if you are trying to compare the two. I doubt it. In case Im misunderstanding you and you are implying that these two women's speeches are comparable then you may have not actually seen Maxine's speech. The link is here: https://t.co/xfUGDpxCSh hope this helps!
https://t.co/a9CvNaeORr
The NRA's Dana Loesch calling for journalists to be curb stomped. This is wreckless &amp; deeply disappointing. People that use their voice to encourage violence &amp; hate in America go against what it means to be American. As a citizen, a mother &amp; a 2nd amendment supporter I'm appalled

@mkhammer @MeghanMcCain Hi Mary, Your original tweet is apocalyptic &amp; feeds the conspiracy that govt is coming for us. Why do that? The majority of us want a list of sensible gun law amendments. They are painfully overdue. We are all on the side of LIFE, a constitutional right. Let's continue dialogue!
@mkhammer @MeghanMcCain How the above tweet has become the rhetoric to describe citizens that want sensible gun law reform.

Has anyone had mono and could feel sort of ok, walking around,, during the day but a gnarly sore throat in middle of night every night for 10 days or more? Is it mono? Walking mono?
If I do have mono and drink martinis tonight will that help kill it?
This band is so good. https://t.co/fXNtNJhtBj

Upon reflection, every time I’ve ever said “that would be a great band name” I have been wrong. This includes “Adult Eggs”. That one was never good but for a second I thought it was. #soloartist

@garbage @GirlschoolLA You are both Queens. And, clearly we all on the same page here. The actresses have united. Perhaps the musicians should as well.
@garbage @GirlschoolLA On point ladies.
I feel like I could come up with a new legend candy bar. It would involve peanut butter. Haven’t gotten beyond that yet. Stay tuned. Also, have people given up on new candy bars? Are all the classics done?
@BestCoast @nytimes Same. That's also passed down to us through our mothers I think.  As a way to make us feel better about male aggression.
Didn't realize until I got home that I had a dried pomegranate juice splash on the tip of my nose and a beet juice stache. On the level.

3 of 3:  As a female artist and a member of the Academy, I would like to help in any way possible. @RecordingAcad @nytimes https://t.co/Ic068XdB7N
2 of 3: Full stop. The underrepresentation of female artists has been a problem at the Grammy's for years and Portnow's comment showed us why. It’s time to call a spade a spade. I am asking the academy to make real change here.
1 of 3:Proud to be a part of this article. The lens that this story provides is long overdue. As a recording academy member I feel that Portnow’s attempt at rewording his statement further reveals his cognitive dissonance on the issue. He should've gotten it right the first time.

@Breadyalater You're welcome. It's ok for women to have different opinions about these situations.  I've had bad dates similar to this story &amp; I don't choose to place them in a metoo category.  I think it's important to really hone in on our narrative here.  We are all on the same side:)
@Breadyalater I hope it doesn’t.
@Breadyalater I respectfully disagree and I’m not disappointed in you at all. This story is certainly worthy of a debate.
@Snaggletoothma Good point.
@Snaggletoothma We gotta stay on narrative ya know? This was very much “he gave me wine. He only had red and i wanted white.” I mean come ON.  This story should never have come out.
@JessicaValenti Because she remained naked sitting on her counter top. Is that not a non verbal cue in and of itself? You should not highlight this story. It muddies the waters and undermines feminism and the metoo movement.  We have agency.  This was a bad date. Are you able to see it that way?
@sabaaIfuhaid I agree with both op-Eds. This story was the most anti-feminist steaming pile I’ve ever read. Women have agency. We have power. You put your clothes on and you leave. He never forced her to do anything. I’ve been in this situation too.  It’s a bad date.  This is revenge porn.
