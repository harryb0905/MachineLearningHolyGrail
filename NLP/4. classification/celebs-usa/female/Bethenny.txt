I ask airlines @UnitedAirlines @AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue @SouthwestAir @VirginAmerica etc. stop serving airborne allergens. I‚Äôll stay on this until you do. The one that initially refused &amp; pilot who called me out on speaker knows. Cabin backed me up. Plane didn‚Äôt turn around.

To clarify: some allergens are transmitted by touch &amp; air. Fish is one &amp; is fatal. The more exposure to them, the more susceptible. It‚Äôs not like an immunity thing where more exposure means less susceptible. It‚Äôs opposite. I‚Äôve always kept it quiet but that‚Äôs over now.

Exactly. Even in everyday life, spoiling your appetite with good choices before a meal controls the beast. Also, eat all of your veg/high volume good foods first so you‚Äôre full on healthy &amp; eat less of the stuff you want to limit. Have a plan. https://t.co/uJf4gL7Ci1
Xo @NickyHilton for being supportive of #bstrong from day one, spreading the message. You took it a step forward &amp; proposed it to your family foundation (Conrad N. Hilton) who donated 20k to #bstrong w 100 percent going to cash cards to give victims dignity &amp; rebuild. #bstrong
DO spoil your appetite. Cancel your membership to the clean plate club. Have a little of everything you love. Just don‚Äôt binge &amp; don‚Äôt get bombed or you will eat like a beast &amp; do or say something stupid. https://t.co/NFhyOXP8My
Don‚Äôt starve yourself planning to binge on the main meal. It wreaks havoc on your body. We pass out not from tryptophan (we don‚Äôt consume enough to have an effect) but from all of the combinations of food that your body(the machine has to digest). Enjoy &amp; indulge but don‚Äôt binge.

The headline that Florence was downgraded to Category 1 was confusing bc it seemed less dire. But water levels, flooding, lingering &amp; continuation of this has made it catastrophic-w deaths, destruction &amp; hundreds of ks w no power. Each storm has a different personality.
@biggysmallz https://t.co/xUlt3jQVhY
Thank you. We are on the ground garnering supplies, assessing the worst hit areas, bringing solar lights &amp; toys(kids get depressed) and, most importantly, we are raising money for cash cards bc only people know exactly what they need and their economy needs the infusion. https://t.co/V1palGoX2a

For those who have anxiety &amp; are scared, I‚Äôve met thousands of affected by disasters &amp; when you stick together, have faith, appreciate family &amp; get involved in the rebuild, you survive &amp; prevail.

Bravo has reasons for not asking hwives to return. It‚Äôs based on research &amp; focus groups &amp; YOU. Aside from 3 years I left, no RHONY cast member has ever quit. One saying they chose to depart &amp; attributing it to me is fiction. It‚Äôs healthier to be truthful about a hard situation.
@NicoleSchinelli @Andy @Bravotv Bravo has reasons for not asking hwives to return. We‚Äôre not included in those decisions based on research &amp; focus groups.

@michhandwerker This is a fact. Families need to be together. We have experienced so many tragedies from emotional &amp; mental illness. We need to set children up for success.
The one common thread in my relief work trips to Houston, Mexico, Puerto Rico &amp; Guatemala is: no matter how horrendous, hopeless &amp; devastating the conditions are, people have hope &amp; can survive if they feel the comfort of being with their families. Families must stay together.
@marchezvite Working on it
Sometimes you tell me that you cannot help. Well, guess what? The ‚Äúthisisacris‚Äù t shirts you purchased have raised 7k for victims in crisis AND you get to wear it &amp; help spread the word. Xoxo
BStrong has just received another 25k donation for victims in crisis. I am looking into the immigration issue as we speak. Charitable initiatives need to adhere to their guidelines. Perhaps the cards could help w immigration lawyers. We‚Äôre also still working on Guatemala.

Why do authorities lie about possible deaths. If I personally met several people who have dead relatives &amp; there is a woman missing 50 &amp; cities were wiped out in Guatemala WTF? Is it possible for people to be out of ‚Äúcover your ass mode‚Äù vs saying 100 when it‚Äôs thousands? ENOUGH!

Sorry my instastory is a bit out of order yesterday bc it wasn‚Äôt uploading. We went from active volcano areas, to shelters to town. So many people have lost children or have missing loved ones. What a tragic &amp; gutting experience. Something so beautiful can be so mean #volcano
We are in such a poor place in the world &amp; yet a day into the disaster, they had schools transformed into shelters &amp; they have the military performing &amp; clowns in the towns to entertain children. This was not the case in PRICO. Kids are an afterthought.
When lava is flowing it comes going 500 miles an hour &amp; destroys everything in its wake. Can you imagine that terror?

@Day_nah Just ask where the money is going. Everyone has the right to know. I bet the people who invested with Madoff asked more questions. There are so many amazing organizations...Donating should be treated like investing.
Wherever you donate, know that many of the big ones w big infrastructure have BIG overhead. The amt that doesn‚Äôt go to victims is staggering.  Publicized charity raises go to BIG charities &amp; people don‚Äôt see the $. Ask how much is going to the people &amp; to whom exactly. Xo
The crisis in #Guatemala is very serious. Over 1.7M people will be affected &amp; casualty numbers are growing. #BStrong is mobilizing as we speak.   Visit https://t.co/vNkXRSauNF to donate. To allocate your donation, please write GUATEMALA. #thisisacrisis #globalempowermentmovement https://t.co/9fphRom744
The cities near by have stores. This is why after Maria, we did overall relief for months then give cards so they can buy what they need and rebuild economy. Every situation is different. https://t.co/sTkg2i41Aw

Guatemala is different from the hurricane sit‚Äôn. My team is going there tom w firefighters. We need plane tickets or miles for rescue workers. Volcano still active. Thousands evacuated &amp; only ash to return to. #BStrong will provide cash cards. Which airlines want to help?
This is a very upsetting day. To be dealing w something so superficial like a reunion dress while watching children dead in Guatemala &amp; to think of a motherless child. I don‚Äôt like this day.
That is how the conversation happened bc I asked how low &amp; how far away from center you would have to be for your child to not be a deterring factor. My therapist said that the scary thing is that is is a major illness albeit one in disguise. People hide. Just terrible. https://t.co/B1uRvG7sSQ
My therapist said when depressed people go into a hole, &amp; don‚Äôt look the same &amp; they can‚Äôt get out &amp; if they can be pulled out they are happy they didn‚Äôt do any harm to themselves. She also pointed out the very happy perfect wife brand she created. So upsetting.
None of us know the reason for people‚Äôs actions. I had a very good friend who had manic depression. He went off his meds bc he thought he could handle it. He killed himself on Valentine‚Äôs Day.

@JinForrest There are so many scammers &amp; con artists which is why giving cards directly eliminates any issue. I have seen &amp; heard stories of people selling relief, politicians storing relief &amp; distributing it so they look good, tossing it so others look bad, smuggling etc.
I didn‚Äôt need to answer that bc you did. https://t.co/90ucJ7IcTe
For this reason: I‚Äôm not donating to another organization &amp; paying their overhead.

There are, but by design, if you have a big infrastructure, overhead etc., the $ can‚Äôt get there. If you give $ directly &amp; subcontract, ie: distribution, ground operations, transportation, patients etc. then you are delegating as needed but don‚Äôt pay annual salaries, rent etc. https://t.co/KeRsMCsBmW
DO NOT donate anywhere where you don‚Äôt precisely &amp; exactly &amp; specifically know where &amp; how much....many high profile people came to me to take them to PRICO on planes to distribute relief bc the big charities couldn‚Äôt help them w planes and relief distribution.
2996 deaths 9/11........1833 deaths KATRINA .....4000+ AND COUNTING (recorded) PUERTO RICO deaths. Really stop and comprehend that. Remember how bad Katrina was. Remember how you felt after 9/11. #THISISACRISIS

Both the dogs have ticks, fleas &amp; anemia. We are waiting on the distemper information. Pray they don‚Äôt have an infectious disease...we will know all in a week. Tests are pretty good so far for stray rescues.

If I believe girls‚Äô t-shirts there are many girl bosses. And some of them are bosses who are apparently also a bitch.
I put the teeth in a ring or @tictac box &amp; in my safe w the note. Hey @tictac you need to make blinged our tooth fairy boxes. https://t.co/IUc0DlYRWt
Awwww https://t.co/m4WL7aQ744
The whole tooth fairy thing is quite stressful. Any wrong moves &amp; this whole thing is blown up. It is a lot of responsibility for generations to come.
So what does the tooth fairy leave if you loose two teeth in one day? Is there a bonus plan? BOGO? Wednesday is Sunday at @CarvelIceCream
@kelsie_nicck We are in a time of heightened sensitivity, anger, rage &amp; the inability to discuss differences. Attempting to make a tweet about ratings into a political alliance is ignorant &amp; incites unnecessary negativity.

In all of my years in NY I have never been parked on the FDR for 20 minutes with zero movement. Does anyone know why? lil nervous.

@alison_futoran As a woman who has witnessed abuse &amp; personally experienced harassment, I‚Äôm currently working on a #BStrong project aiding female victims in crisis. Their voices need to be heard &amp; they need to tools to do it.
Watching @ThePeakyBlinder thanks to you. What series will be next? You‚Äôre my tv critics!!!
I built a brand focused on women &amp; worked in male dominated industries &amp; witnessed the casting couch &amp; the sleaziest men in Hollywood &amp; other biz. The brave female victims need to clearly be heard. Anyone who says they didn‚Äôt know about these high profile men is lying.
I‚Äôve just read many stories of women falsely accusing men of rape. The women bending the truth drown out the voices of the women who really need to be heard now and forever.

9/11. To think that so much other tragedy is on my mind today is mindblowing. There is not enough room for all the destruction and despair.
Just do little amounts @imwhimsigal
Well @YogaWorks set the tone for the day...i dedicated my practice to those affected by Irma. #BStrong
I am going to insist that @NikeLab and @VFILES hire someone to clean their street after their events.
This is really bad. All in this will likely be the worst group of storms in history. #thisisacrisis https://t.co/y0xayWLKJN

@dressforsuccess @DFSHouston Theresa is also homeless now but feels blessed to have a friend to stay with.
@dressforsuccess @DFSHouston Sharon lost everything: her home, her car, possessions. She was more concerned about the homeless she works with than being homeless herself
@dressforsuccess @DFSHouston Tammie and her 13-year-old daughter's home was destroyed. She works with the mentally ill and was more worried about them than herself.
