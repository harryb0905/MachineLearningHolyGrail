In the coming days, I will be calling on the heads of our academies to  come to Washington to meet with me and explain how they will be  rethinking and redoubling their efforts to address this horrendous and  worsening problem.
This report also shows our future leaders aren’t being prepared to help stamp out sexual assault in our armed forces but will in fact perpetuate and worsen this scourge. Our service academies must lead the charge in protecting the dignity and respect of young men and women.
Attempts to address sexual assault in our academies have not only failed, they've allowed rates to jump a staggering 47%. A record 15.8% of women &amp; 2.4% of men experienced unwanted sexual contact in the past year. 1/2 the women cadets/midshipmen reported being sexually harassed.
We expect military service academies attract the best &amp; brightest but this report suggests academic/athletic success does not equate to instilling respect &amp; honor, hallmarks of American military service. Alarm bells should be going off everywhere. https://t.co/80BHoSoJ6M

Banning #trans individuals from joining the military &amp; serving openly/proudly is unconstitutional. The ban's only purpose is to prop up @POTUS’s fabricated crisis. Holding a hearing to get to the bottom of the Admin's propagandized study &amp; introducing leg to fix this injustice.
@POTUS spent 2 minutes at the #MLK memorial today. How about serving federal workers at a soup kitchen during this national day of service?
“I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality...

To equate the legacy of one of America’s finest statesmen and champions of civil rights with a vanity project built on racist ideology and hatred is beyond disgraceful. @VP owes the American people, and the memory of Dr. King, an immediate and profuse apology. @POTUS is no MLK!
Mr. President: Stop negotiating with yourself. You are causing great harm to our union. Federal employees are pawns in your chess game. You will be checkmated, guaranteed.
Federal employees with children are losing their childcare slots because they can’t afford to pay childcare while they aren’t being paid.

One employee said landlords will no longer want to rent to federal workers because they are a financial risk as shutdowns become more frequent.
One EPA employee is using government credit cards issued in her name but can’t get reimbursed because her agency is shut down. It’s ruining her credit score and that could be cause to get fired.

6. Buenos Aires, December 2018.  Informal conversations at dinner and a brief meeting.
5. Paris, November 2018. "Brief greetings" at WWI armistice anniversary.
4. Helsinki, July 2018. Two hour meeting with Trump and Putin. Each had an interpreter present. At the press conference afterward Trump said he “didn’t see any reason” to disbelieve Putin’s claims about the 2016 election.
3. Vietnam, November, 2017.  Trump and Putin had brief sidebars at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.
2. Hamburg Banquet, July 2017.  Trump, Putin and a Russian interpreter talked during the dinner meeting.
1. Hamburg, July 2017. Rex Tillerson was present for the  meeting. Interpreter told reporters that Trump responded to Putin’s denials about 2016 interference by saying “I believe you.”  After this meeting Trump took possession of the interpreter’s notes.
What's been said at the unsupervised #TrumpPutin Meetings? If it was up to @POTUS we would never know!
Bravo to the Virginia Senate, which just voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Now it’s on to the State Assembly and the annals of history! We’re just one state shy of what we need to pass the #ERANow!
The #TrumpShutdown is flooding public lands w/ feces &amp; trash, risks housing for seniors &amp; those w/disabilities &amp; we lose food stamps on 3/1. We are facing a humanitarian crisis, &amp; not just at our border, because @POTUS views the shutdown as some kind of trophy or John Wayne win.
.@POTUS’s AG nominee said whistleblower protections pose a threat to “the liberties of the American people.” And by people he meant parasitic contractors who rip off the fed gov with $640 toilets and $400 hammers. Whistleblowes are brave Americans who see fraud and call it out!
Deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Carol Channing, a dear friend and one of the Grand Dames of American theater.

Almost 40,000 Americans were killed with a gun last year. Would Congress sit idly by and do nothing if 40,000 Americans died from a viral epidemic or tainted food? No! Congress must take action to protect the American public and pass #HR8 #NeverAgain
And most of these cases stem from people overstaying their visas. In FY2017, @HomelandSecurity reported 606,926 suspected overstays, or double the number of southern border apprehensions. In FY16, there were 408,870 southern border apprehensions vs 544,676 suspected overstays.
.@POTUS continues to wall himself off from reality on border security with bogus claims of apprehensions at our southern border being on the rise. The fact is they've dropped dramatically, from more than 1 million in the 1980s to the mid-2000s, to less than 400,000 in FY18.

It shouldn’t take an act of Congress to institute basic health screenings for flu, meningitis, and other potentially deadly diseases at the border. If we can manage it for foreign travelers during outbreaks surely we can do it for families, and children, seeking asylum.

In 2016, @POTUS’ new Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said, “The fence doesn’t solve the problem…to just say build the darn fence and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd &amp; almost childish for someone running for president to take that simplistic of [a] view.”

Truly alarming that @POTUS withdrew from Syria at Erdogan’s request. We cannot have a President who is so erratic that he heeds the slick talk of a so-called ally over the advice of his distinguished military adviser and Secretary of Defense.

It's hard to understand the sheer audacity required for someone to cut a deal to be fulsome in their testimony and to tell the truth, and then continue to lie. The Special Counsel isn't a sucker and justice isn't blind in this case.

For someone who is clearly upset at being called the greatest threat to democracy, @POTUS has an odd way of responding to the criticism. Impugning the former Navy SEAL &amp; Special Ops Cmdr who served in the Gulf, Afghanistan &amp; Iraq only bolsters Ret Adm McRaven’s argument.

Now @POTUS is saying he didn’t know Whitaker even though he told Fox &amp; Friends last month “I know Matt Whitaker.” What does it say about POTUS NOT interviewing the man he appointed to be chief US law enforcement officer? Incompetence? Malfeasance? Irresponsibility? Recklessness?

We must not leave anything to chance. The documents I have published on my website show that the staff of the Special Counsel could and should protect the evidence in the Mueller investigation by acting now! https://t.co/6NRaEfu7g9
We could be in a similar situation today, with a trove of documents gathered by Special Counsel Muller. Like Nixon, @POTUS regularly forces government officials to choose between fealty to him or the rule of law.
The Federal District Court placed those records in the custody of the Court itself, ensuring that the evidence and documents were not tampered with or destroyed.
After Nixon fired the Special Prosecutor leading the Watergate investigation, &amp; used the Federal Protections Service to “secure” the office where all the evidence/documents were located, the Special Prosecutor’s staff obtained a court order to preserve the records.
.@POTUS’s firing of AG Sessions, I fear, is a blatant attack on the Mueller investigation. We must look to the past and the lessons we can learn from the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, which would have succeeded were it not for the quick action of the Special Prosecutor’s staff.
@EJLevy @1a Thanks! It would be an honor!
Last night's massacre at a CA dance hall &amp; bar marks the 307th mass shooting this year &amp; the 6th this month. To the parents &amp; loved ones of those murdered, please know that I continue to fight for commonsense gun safety laws. Thoughts &amp; prayers aren't enough, Congress must act!
Firing Sessions &amp; replacing him w/a man who has repeatedly/publicly talked about the ways the AG could shut down the Special Counsel’s case, or as he calls it the "Mueller lynch mob," puts us firmly into constitutional crisis territory. Whitaker must immediately recuse himself.
Voters made history last night, electing the highest number of women ever to serve in Congress. They also sent a clear message that the House must fulfill its duty as a check on the Trump Admin's rampant corruption &amp; @POTUS's hateful rhetoric &amp; policies. https://t.co/zKjGq7LFqO

Trump thinks because his uncle was an MIT engineering prof 45 yrs ago he has a “natural instinct for science.” That’s like saying my uncle flew planes so I can land this 747 jumbo jet. @POTUS needs to heed MIT’s real climate experts before it’s too late.  https://t.co/iWEKjfhe6Q

Contradicting his claims of $40-50 million in SA investments at his rally, @realDonaldTrump now tweets he has “no financial interests in Saudi Arabia…” This might work for those who take him at his word. For the rest of us, releasing his tax returns would set the record straight

Saudia Arabia carried out 48 beheadings by sword in the FIRST FOUR MONTHS of this year alone &amp; its roots in the Sept. 11th attacks run deep, yet @POTUS is groveling to kiss MBS’s rings. Clearly his bromance w/despots and dictators isn’t limited to Putin and Kim Jong Un.
There’s a lot we don’t know, but what we do know clearly points to assassination, including Khashoggi being interrogated over six hours by a 15 member hit squad linked to MBS and the royal family.
.@POTUS made an unholy alliance with Saudi Arabia and now is tripping over himself to defend the blood curdling killing and dismemberment of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi—using a bone saw, I may add.
It’s #MeTooOneYearLater &amp; what a year it’s been, from news of @POTUS paying off women he had affairs w/soon after the birth of his son, to mocking Dr. Blasey Ford’s pain &amp; heart-breaking testimony. That’s why this is the year women get the last laugh &amp; grab ‘em by the midterms!

Sen Hatch (R-UT), the longest serving Member of the U.S. Senate, telling sexual assault survivors to “grow up” while waving them away dismissively is Exhibit A in the argument for term limits. #TimesUp #MeTooCongress #MeToo
This is why the Senate is blocking reforms to require Senators &amp; MOCs to pay out of pocket when they harass or discriminate against their staff. This is why women still aren’t equal to men in our Constitution. This is why we need to send a clear message this Nov. #TimesUp #ERANow

The tainted process in the Kavanaugh confirmation will result in a tainted justice. Instead of pursuing the truth, the Senate pursued political power.
One year ago today, Weinstein was outed. Today the octogenarians of the Senate have been outed. We do not live in the 1950s anymore. You guys don’t get it. 93-97% of the women tell the truth. Dr. Blasey Ford is telling the truth.

Why is the FBI talking to Dr. Blasey Ford’s ex-boyfriends, not HER? Why are they digging up Ramirez’s exes, but not reaching out to the list of more than 20 people who witnessed or knew about Kavanaugh exposing himself to her at a party? Who’s under investigation here?
Kavanaugh lies about little things and big things… You tell the Senate you had no connections to grease the wheels to get into Yale. Really? You were a legacy. You deny your nickname was Bart. Really? See your note to your buddies signed Bart. https://t.co/qmT3zwq8q0

As if Kavanaugh and Judge’s laughter, seared into Dr. Blasey Ford’s memory, wasn’t disgusting enough, last night’s jeers and laughter stoked  by @POTUS’s revolting comments brought our nation to a devastating new  low. I condemn POTUS's words &amp; deeds. All Americans should.

The White House isn’t allowing the FBI to interview Dr. Blasey Ford or investigate the perjury Kavanaugh committed while testifying before the Senate, under oath, or his attempts at witness tampering. This isn’t an investigation, it’s a circus &amp; @POTUS is the ringmaster.
Make no mistake- ⁦@POTUS⁩ still has handcuffs on the FBI on what they can investigate. This tactic is about giving cover 2 ⁦@SenateGOP⁩, not getting 2 the truth. Dr. Blasey Ford hasn’t even been interviewed, why wouldn’t they start with her?! https://t.co/3BiymngZln

... Second, notice those two other attendees, one of whom Mitchell  highlighted: Mark Judge and P.J. Smyth. https://t.co/w8McXb7Qor
The Washington Post reports: Notice two things here. First, that “Squi” was in attendance at the  party — someone who, we learned thanks to Mitchell’s  questioning of Ford, was going out with Ford over the course of that summer.
MITCHELL: If you could just identify: Is ‘Judge’ Mark Judge? KAVANAUGH: It is. It’s Tim Gaudette, Mark Judge, Tom Kaine, P.J. Smyth, Bernie McCarthy, Chris Garrett.
MITCHELL: To what does this refer, and to whom? KAVANAUGH: [after explaining the “Tobin’s House” part] It looks like we went over to Timmy’s. You want to know their last names, too? I’m happy to do it.
“Skis” is short for “brewskis,” or beers. The entry was July 1, a Thursday. And Sen. Mitchell asked him about it.    MITCHELL: The entry says, and I quote, go to ‘Timmy’s for skis with Judge, Tom, P.J. Bernie and ... Squi?’    KAVANAUGH: Squi. It’s a nickname.
Trump also said the supplemental investigation, which he called an "update," must be "limited in scope and completed in less than one week." Will the FBI be allowed to talk to Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi and Timmy? https://t.co/s4ElreMSWh
Your voices DO count. Watch the video. I believe Sen Flake was moved by these survivors’ pleas! https://t.co/Gv7i4Ybayk
Trump now says Dr Blasey Ford's testimony was "very compelling," what does that mean? Compelling normally means you are persuaded. If it was so compelling why did it take Sen Flake to force an FBI investigation in the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?
By the way, would any of this have happened if Sen Flake was not on the @senjudiciary committee and retiring? Congress is in deep trouble.
There was no willingness to support an FBI investigation by Trump or Kavanaugh UNTIL Sen Flake spoke up. Now, of course, they support an FBI investigation and Dr Blasey Ford is credible. What hypocrisy. #FBIInvestigation #KanavaughHearings
We should all take a deep breath and thank @JeffFlake for putting the brakes on the vote and asking for the obviously-needed FBI investigation. #KanavaughHearings
This is the week for sexual assault survivors to reach out to their Senators to dispel the myths promoted in the Kavanaugh hearings &amp; share their experiences so that Senators will understand them, hear them &amp; believe them because we're not going back! https://t.co/H2AeFLhrY6
For those who keep ref DC law, Dr Blasey Ford said the assault was at a party in Maryland. Georgetown Prep, where Kavanaugh was a student, is in Maryland. The law that changed the legal drinking age from 18 to 21 in Maryland took effect in ‘82.  Kavanaugh, born in ‘65, was 17.
Mark Judge doesn’t recall the events, would only participate in a confidential fact-finding interview. This is the statement of someone who is avoiding having to testify under oath and tell the truth. #KavanaughWithdrawNow
One of the biggest takeaways of the Kavanaugh testimony was how political he was instead of how judicial he was. He has been a political operative his whole career—going after Clinton and promoting torture under Bush. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Something lost in Kavanaugh’s comments about his beer drinking as a senior in high school - the drinking age was 21 at the time, not 18. His effort to make himself sound squeaky clean and law-abiding fell like a lead balloon. He is not telling the truth. #KavanaughWithdrawNow
And we want Dr. Blasey Ford to know that we have her back, and we're not going back! https://t.co/JDdUvhWrUF
Come to think of it, it’s also straight out of @POTUS’s playbook of lies, scorched earth tactics, and conspiracy theories. #KavanaughWithdrawNow
He sounds so angry. How can he be a measured jurist? He can’t bring himself to say, “Yes, please, have the FBI investigate and meet with corroborating witnesses for each side.” #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
He is trying to be his own character reference and act as his own attorney. #KavanaughWithdrawNow
Dr. Blasey Ford never said it happened on a weekend. Why is Kavanaugh focused on weekends? #KavanaughWithdrawNow
Judge Kavanaugh’s speech is that of an angry man who does not look like he can be judicial. For the good of the Supreme Court he should withdraw now. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing #KavanaughWithdrawNow
Kavanaugh is using the Clarence Thomas playbook of angry denials and blaming conspiracies against him. It worked for Thomas, we can’t let it work for Kavanaugh. #KavanaughHearings
Two major events on Capitol Hill today: #KavanaughConfirmationHearing and @votingvillagedc demo.  Our democracy needs protection from debauched judges just as much as from those trying to disrupt our elections.

The Republican prosecutor is making Dr. Blase Ford look more credible. This a pivotal moment in history and being on the right side of history is believing Dr. Blasey Ford. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing #KavanaughWithdrawNow
Now Republicans are arguing again that this was a case of mistaken identity and claim to have letters naming men who might have assaulted her. She says she is 100 percent sure it was Brett Kavanaugh! I believe her.
.@senjudiciary - bring Mark Judge from his Bethany beach house to testify! He needs to stop drinking beer and face the music of truth! #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Sen Durbin makes my point. She has absolutely nothing to gain by coming forward, had no intention to come forward, but she did so out of civic duty.  #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Dr Blasey Ford says what she remembers most is the uproarious laughter between Judge and Kavanaugh at her expense. Debasement of the victim. Treating the victim as if she is worth nothing, as if she is nothing. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
Mitchell is doing a good job of cross examining gently, but it is still disgusting. The witness is NOT on trial. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing #KanavaughHearings
Under oath, she says, “Absolutely not,” when questioned about  whether she mistakenly identified Kavanaugh. I believe she is telling the truth! #KavanaughHearing
Dr. Blasey Ford’s experience of doing poorly in school after the assault is like the more than 50 women I have talked to over the years who experienced a downward spiral in school or on the job as a result of the trauma they suffered. #KavanaughHearing
The tortured process that Dr. Blasey Ford describes about how she was outed is frightening and disgusting. She wanted to be kept confidential. She did not want to come forward. She is telling the truth. Kavanaugh must withdraw. He can’t be confirmed. #KavanaughWithdrawNow
“Sexual assault victims should have the right to decide if and when their stories are revealed,” Dr Blasey Ford says. #KavanaghHearing
“I thought it was my civic duty to relay information about a prospective nominee since he was on the short list,” Dr Blasey Ford says. #KavanaghHearing
“I convinced myself not to talk about it since Brett didn’t rape me. Women always find excuses not to come forward for fear of what will happen to them.” Just like what is happening to Dr. Blasey Ford now, including death threats to her and her family. #KavanaghHearing
Dr. Blasey Ford says she drank one beer. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. She wanted to use the bathroom. She was pushed into the bedroom and the door was locked.  Her testimony is shocking. Members are listening intently. Sen Flake looks pained. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
She remembers 4 boys at the house. Names them. Summer event. Spur of the moment gathering. She doesn’t remember all the details. But the details she remembers are seared in her memory. #KavanaghHearing
“I am terrified,” Dr. Blasey Ford says. Her voice is cracking. It is obvious that she does not want to do this. What a courageous woman! We have her back, we are not going back! #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
@SenFeinstein - “Is this the best we can do?“ #KavanaughConfirmationHearing #KavanaughHearings
@SenFeinstein is pointing out that even Anita Hill’s accusations were investigated by the FBI. @SenateGOP refused to have the FBI investigate Ford’s allegations. Not one witness to support either Kavanaugh or Dr Blasey Ford is being brought forward to corroborate their claims!
The Republican Senators all are looking down and not at the witness or the audience. #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
This is reminiscent of the Salem witch trials. Dr. Blasey Ford has published 60 peer reviewed articles. Her credentials are stunning.
The mood is tense. It seems like everyone is expecting an explosive outcry. I feel like women are being tried all over the country. The message to all women by the Republicans in the Senate is “women, shut up and take it or we will crucify you and try you.” #KavanaughHearings
Grassley is flustered and defensive. His arguments are baseless. He can’t even pronounce victim Ramirez’s last name. #KavanaughWithdrawNow

It’s not he said, she said. It’s he said, she said, she said, she said.
Let’s remember this is a character interview, not a criminal trial. If Rachel Mitchell treats Dr. Blasey Ford like a criminal, Kavanaugh is toast with the American people. Blasey Ford NEVER wanted to be outed, she has nothing to gain. Kavanaugh has a lifetime job at stake.

Grabbing a woman under the table at Sardi’s, groping women sitting next to you on flights, and forcing your tongue down someone’s throat is sexual assault!
Who knows how many sexual assaults he’s committed in his lifetime? At least 19 women have publicly accused @POTUS of sexual assault, harassment, or having extra marital affairs with them. https://t.co/Bm7B1MAAX1
He bragged to Access Hollywood about “grabbing them by the pussy” and getting away with it. He paid off numerous women he had sex with even though he was married with a newborn baby at home.
No matter how malignant or vicious they are, @POTUS believes the men because he has a history of doing the same thing.
According to @TheJusticeDept, 2 out of 3 sexual assaults go unreported to the police. And it’s no wonder. Look at the way this distinguished professor, who has a sterling reputation, is being hung and crucified by @POTUS, the U.S. Senate, and GOP Members of @senjudiciary.
That includes @POTUS, who has scorned a survivor of sexual assault for not going to the police when she was 15-years-old to report a traumatic and humiliating crime! #WhyIDidntReport

There is misogyny in the U.S. Senate pure and simple, whether it’s trying to undercut the CAA Reform Act or the way that Dr. Blasey Ford is being treated. And women across the country know it when they see it.

The best example about what America is and isn’t is embodied in the funeral service of @SenJohnMcCain. Every student, every adult would be better Americans by watching this extraordinary service.

It is heartening and reassuring to see Republicans and Democrats honor the remarkable life of John McCain. He was a military hero and an American hero—a warrior in life and in death to protect the country he loved so much. This is what America is all about, e pluribus unum.

If you need any more convincing that we must finally address gun violence, look at this stunning statistic: In 2016, 251,000 people around the world died from firearms, that’s 688 people a day. The U.S. ranked #2, a deeply troubling indictment for any country.

DeVos is twisting herself into a pretzel trying to undo legislative intent by giving schools the right to buy guns. She will lose in court.
.@POTUS doesn’t get it. The Attorney General works for the American people. He is not the POTUS attorney. The AG’s allegiance and loyalty is to the constitution and statutes, not Trump. I never thought I would be defending Jeff Sessions but I am.
Delusional, self-promoting @POTUS will ignore all norms and cross any red line. Republicans need to stop closing their eyes, grow a spine and protect the Mueller investigation. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
Secretary DeVos’ plan to arm teachers and pay for it with mental health funding is dangerous and not what Americans want. An Education Secretary should protect students, not line the pockets of the NRA.
No president should be able to pardon an individual who is a person of interest in a criminal investigation of the President. That should be a red line and grounds for impeachment.
The WH is becoming a house of cards and the King of the Swamp is about to fall. POTUS is protecting Manafort and scorning HIS attorney Cohen. Could tapes be the final straw once again?

The fact that Orin Hatch has seen the light should give @POTUS the license, if not the moral enlightenment, to finally acknowledge the worth of #LGBT Americans. https://t.co/H1OgFNohUi
Ivanka, who cleared a cool $12 million last year, came to the Hill promoting childcare benefits. Her father proposes billions in cuts to school programs. It must be hard for them to imagine that most parents can’t even afford basic #summercare.

.@realdonaldtrump legitimizes North Korea, gets nothing back, and declares NK no longer a threat. The media reports on it and Trump declares them our "biggest enemy." Disturbing how much more comfortable he is with autocrats than democracy.
Only @realdonaldtrump could think putting our flag on equal footing with that of a murderous dictatorship is less disrespectful than kneeling to exercise the freedoms that flag represents.

.@POTUS deserves credit for agreeing to #NKSummit &amp;deserves shame for throwing a hissy fit w/our closest allies &amp; using such degrading language. This must be more than a photo op w/Kim. We demand rigorous verification of denuclearization w/24 hour monitoring &amp; no boundaries.

Separation of children from their families "can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child's brain architecture and affecting his or her short- and long-term health" and it "can carry lifelong consequences for children," said Dr. Colleen Kraft, President @AmCadPeds

Though the responsibility for this rash gamble rests squarely on President Trump’s shoulders, the price will be paid by all of us for years, if not generations, to come.
(2/2) His decision opens the door for Iran to reengage in developing a nuclear bomb. Why would anyone trust us? We've now pulled out of the Paris Accord and the JCPOA, both of which undermine us as a country and a world power.
(1/2) POTUS’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear agreement despite the outcry from his own administration and our allies around the world is nothing more than a reckless bid to appear strong to his base by following through on his campaign claims that this was a ‘bad deal.’

The Constitution is clear: the #Census must collect information on the total number of residents in America. By continuing his maniacal vendetta against CA &amp; other blue states, @POTUS is endangering one of the bedrocks of public policy formation to rob CA of $1.5 billion.
My bill, HR 4041, would help protect all currently serving #transgender troops from baseless separation from the armed forces, much as they have honorably protected our national security and freedoms at home and abroad.
I’m profoundly disturbed by Trump’s ignorance of the many #trans servicemembers who have honorably defended our country &amp; are being kicked to the curb bc of who they are. The bravery, sacrifice &amp; leadership that trans troops show every day puts @POTUS to shame. Congress must act!

This mania has to stop. The #NRA is a menace in our society and paralyzes Members of Congress from doing what they know is right. NO ONE wants to take guns for hunting and protection away from responsible gun owners.
Reading this article sent chills down my spine. I know the kind of devastation multiple gunshot wounds can do to the body. I live with it every day. I’m one of the lucky ones who survived.
AR-15 guns &amp; similar semiautomatic rifles are weapons of war, not self-defense. But don’t take my word for it. Dr. Heather Sher, who treated #Parkland victims, says the bullets are so deadly that “there was nothing left to repair.” https://t.co/u4lsd9i5Zd

You can’t buy Sudafed without showing your ID – why should you be able to buy a firearm without a background check? We need universal #BackgroundChecks for ALL gun sales. It’s time to close the private sale loophole once and for all.
42% of gun owners bought their last firearm w/o a background check. Background checks mean 63% fewer mass shootings by people prohibited from buying guns, &amp; 64% fewer mass shootings on domestic violence. No gun sales without #BackgroundChecks check should be the law of the land!
For once I can commend @POTUS for leadership. Mind you, the #NRA supported such legislation in the wake of the Las Vegas shootings and then fell silent.  https://t.co/fbJiqI994r

@POTUS I do agree with @POTUS on one thing he said today, #domesticviolence does destroy lives, literally. 3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.
Just when we thought @POTUS couldn’t sink any lower or be any more offensive he exceeds our expectations and trashes the wives and victims of domestic violence with claims of false accusations. Apparently his motto is when they go low, he goes even lower. https://t.co/Yn9O9veHeh

And when @POTUS says, "We certainly wish him well" and "He says he's innocent," what about #Porter 's ex-wives and former girlfriend? Does the President and WH wish them well? Does POTUS and the WH take the women at their word?
What does WH COS #Kelly mean when he says they “take domestic violence seriously”? Does that mean ignoring the FBI review? Allowing a serial DV abuser to work in the WH? Allowing #Porter to continue to have access to top secret docs? Defending him even after the news gets out?
Absolutely agree with RBG: "this concept of We the People has become ever more embracing. And so I would like to see an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution." She's right – that’s why I have introduced H.J. Res 53, because we need to ratify the #ERAnowCongress!
Kushner, Flynn, Papadopoulos, Sessions, and #Porter have all lied to the FBI, yet the Republicans are only interested in going after #Steele on perjury charges. People in glass White Houses shouldn’t throw stones. https://t.co/ftTjqzZRoF)

For 45 years, Roe v. Wade has affirmed the constitutional rights of women to safe, legal abortions. It’s under constant attack – including 19 states adopting 63 new restrictions in 2017 and the Hyde Amdt. That is why I #RiseUp4Roe &amp; will always work to #ProtectRoe #BeBoldEndHyde https://t.co/VeKQPPWqFb
Whether it’s noon, midnight, or any hour between, @HouseDemocrats are ready to vote on a compromise that benefits all Americans. There is strong bipartisan support for children’s health, military funding &amp; #DACA. Only @POTUS stands in the way.  https://t.co/DWoIgVggAD
Senate Democrats and Republicans are working on a compromise right now, and I and my colleagues in the House are ready for a 3 am vote. It’s time to fix the mess @POTUS made by his lack of leadership. We can end the #TrumpShutdown
‘To believe that you can successfully blame Democrats for a shutdown over the DACA debate is naïve.’ – Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) [1/15/18]
‘I think it’s a loser for everybody, but it’s probably more of a loser if you’re in control.’ – Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) [1/10/18]
‘We can’t blame it on the Democrats because we control the House and have a Republican president.’ – Rep. Peter King (R-NY) [1/2/18]
‘I think it’s the president’s fault. He hasn’t led. No question in my mind about that. He hasn’t led on this or many other issues … we’ll all get blamed but mostly the Republican administration will get blamed — as they should.’ – Rep. Dave Trott (R-MI) [1/19/18]
This is what rank-and-file Republicans are saying about the #TrumpShutdown ...
I have news for you Mr. President. This isn’t a game or some backhanded deal with your rich oligarch friends. This is the health and safety of our country, and the support of our troops. #DoYourJob
The difference is @POTUS orchestrating the #TrumpShutdown to serve his own needs. This isn’t about America First or Making America Great Again. There is only one winner in his game.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have, in all previous shutdowns, always been able to agree to fund payment for our troops – so what’s different this time?
Even worse, @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell just blocked Senate Democrats from passing a measure that would have guaranteed our troops are paid during the #Trumpshutdown.
The #TrumpShutdown will continue to hurt troop readiness by making planning and budgeting for the DoD and Pentagon even more backlogged and off budget.
Sec Def Mattis noted last year that we’ve had 9 years of CRs, and last year Congress enacted 30 separate continuing resolutions on the DoD, placing our “troops at greater risk.” https://t.co/86MSJumpKR
The reality is that we have passed 3 short-term CRs since Oct. 1, that’s 110 days, because House and Senate Republicans and @POTUS were focused on sneaking their #GOPTaxScam through in the dead of night, to the exclusion of running the government and passing a budget.
.@POTUS and Republicans are using our troops’ missing paychecks as a pawn in their political gamesmanship and the #Trumpshutdown – which is good for only @POTUS, as he gleefully bragged last year. https://t.co/AFHgk78urg
I and the @HouseDemWomen have come to together to call for an end to the #Trumpshutdown and for Good faith negotiations. Kids can’t use #CHIP health care coverage if funding for our community health clinics is killed. This isn’t a political show. Real lives are at stake! https://t.co/Ydq8hFw0Bh
Proud to join @HouseDemWomen in our call for a long term budget that covers all bipartisan priorities, including our troops, the health of our children &amp; families, &amp; #DACA &amp; #Dreamers — issues Ds &amp; Rs can and have agreed on, but are now being held hostage by the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/jDaWiAOUsN
The President and Congressional Republicans are claiming the government shutdown is the work of Democrats, but don’t let them fool you. This is a #TrumpShutdown and a failure of House and Senate Republicans to do their jobs and put their country before their party! #DoYourJob https://t.co/TDVYFrbD38
HISTORIC FAILURE: The #TrumpShutdown is the 5th GOP government shutdown in under 30 years – and the FIRST where they’ve controlled the entire government.
The priorities Americans want to see addressed (pensions, DREAMers, health care for kids, etc) aren’t controversial. So why did Republicans choose a #TrumpShutdown over these bipartisan ideas?
I and my colleagues are hard at work in the Capitol to end #TrumpShutdown – while Republicans are pouting about missing #Davos2018. So much for America first.
The #TrumpShutdown… -Threatens public health &amp; consumer safety -Disrupts our economy &amp; job creation -Blocks services &amp; investments critical to our families &amp; our communities
Want to understand the threat that the #TrumpShutdown poses to American families? Here’s some info on the economic devastation wrought by the last GOP shutdown. https://t.co/n8C51qKmVv
Republicans worked days and nights to ram through giveaways for the richest 1% w/the #GOPTaxScam, giving corps a tax break to outsource manufacturing jobs to foreign countries! Now they refuse to address children’s health, #ProtectDREAMers, or pass a budget. #TrumpShutdown
The govt costs more money to shut down than keep open. The 2013 shutdown cost our economy &gt;$20 billion in lost growth plus $2.5 billion for furloughed workers, $11 million lost in national parks &amp; interest on late payments. Republicans need to figure out how to govern! #DoYourJob
Watch the House Democratic leaders live update on the #TrumpShutdown here. https://t.co/nxTnpOfAkx

@usedgov BJS: 2 out of 3 sexual assaults go unreported to the police. Is it any wonder when Admin bases policy on victim blaming culture? #TitleIX https://t.co/kbcZPpDFrp
@usedgov FBI stats prove only 2-8% of sexual assault victims file false reports.
Asked Sec Jackson for a timeline on the updated guidance promised by @usedgov &amp; why it’s focusing on accused, not survivors &amp; got no answer.
Anne Hedgepeth @AAUW is right on! We must work in a bipartisan fashion to protect #TitleIX

@POTUS @potos Bethesda, Congressional, Sligo Park, TPC Potomac, Woodmont, Falls Rd, Redgate, Manor, Argyle, Lakewood, Wash, and Pinecrest, to name a few.
@POTUS And I'm sure @POTOS would qualify for the many private courses that are near the WH, like Kenwood, Columbia, Burning Tree, Chevy Chase...
@POTUS Or East Potomac Golf Course, Rock Creek Golf Course, Langston Golf Course, Whiskey Creek Golf Club, P.B. Dye Golf Club, Raspberry Falls...
@POTUS There are even more options closer to home for @POTUS, like The Courses at Andrews w/three, 18 hole courses within a 15 min drive of DC.
I have a question. Isn't there a golf green at Camp David? Why do the taxpayers have to pay for @POTUS enriching himself at his golf resort?

@POTUS He is destroying the country, and @VP and GOP Leadership who have the power to remove him w/ the #25thamendment are letting it happen.
@POTUS are trying to simply survive in #PuertoRico, play in the #NFL, dare to criticize him in the media, pursue diplomacy; the list goes on.
@POTUS He will sabotage anyone and anything so he can "win." So be damned if you need health care through the #ACA, need contraception, …
.@POTUS’ sheer malignancy can be seen in his latest bid to gut health care for the most vulnerable, leaving lives hanging in the balance.

@POTUS @NBCNews @SenBobCorker @NFL @jemelehill @espn 6) Our entire diplomatic corps and his presidential predecessors, who he belittled for their work towards a peaceful solution w/North Korea.
@POTUS @NBCNews @SenBobCorker @NFL 5) @jemelehill @ESPN, who @POTUS vilified when Hill noted that retaliation against NFL players infringes on their constitutional rights.
@POTUS @NBCNews @SenBobCorker 4) The @NFL, whose tax status he threatened. @POTUS also attacked NFL players for exercising their right to freedom of expression.
@POTUS @NBCNews 3) @SenBobCorker, who @POTUS pilloried for expressing his concern for the safety of our country;
@POTUS 2) @NBCNews, which he threated w/retaliation for exercising its first Amendment right and duty to report on his wish for 10x more nukes;
@POTUS #PuertoRico, which he threatened to abandon as thousands of our fellow American citizens face starvation &amp; fatal illness;

The tragedy in #LasVegas shows the danger of gun manufacturers’/GOP push 4 #suppressors. How many more would have perished with less sound?
No more moments of silence - the best way to honor the #LasVegasShooting victims is a moment of action to prevent further senseless deaths.
I can't believe @POTUS spent his day golfing while calling disaster victims begging for help "ingrates." Something is wrong w/this picture!

@POTUS 4)   The “fake media” did NOT lie about @POTUS’s disastrous call with the Australian Prime Minister.
@POTUS 3)      The @DonaldJTrumpJr statement was NOT written without @POTUS 's direction.
@POTUS 2)   The President of Mexico did NOT call @POTUS to congratulate him on the decrease in #immigration.
@POTUS 1)      The head of the @boyscouts did NOT call @POTUS and tell him what a good job he did.
How many cherry trees has @POTUS cut down this week?  Let's take a quick count.
@POTUS Odd how @POTUS continues to make excuses for #Putin / Russia’s actions and instead blames lawmakers' proportionate response. Why?
@POTUS .@POTUS’s own Cabinet calls Russia an adversary. Congress is focused on nat’l security, not Putin bromance.
Actually, @POTUS, you can thank #Putin who invaded Ukraine, violated treaty, disrupted election. https://t.co/r2XYKIEmEZ
@POTUS "I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress." That's what worries me: deals w/Putin instead of accountability!

$25 million for #CTE research is a drop in the bucket when you consider the long-term health costs for our brave #veterans
Of work left to do. It's critical we fund more studies like the #NFL brain study since we can't even diagnose #CTE when the patient is alive
The recent study on the brains of #NFL players was partially funded by a $30 million grant that @NFL made to NIH - and there's plenty
It's time for Congress to accept the science and make a real effort to combat #CTE by funding CTE research to aid in early detection.
Congress has funded only 5 projects 4 $2.9 million 4 #CTE research despite increased risks of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's &amp; mental health probs
Arguments that @DeptofDefense is spending $125 million on #TBI research fails to recognize long-term effects of repeated head injuries.
We need to fund research to promote earlier diagnosis of #CTE to address blast trauma suffered by our troops. https://t.co/DpYRuqdlrz

Senseless gun violence should have no place in our beautiful city or anywhere in our country. I am heartbroken.
I am also grateful to the first responders and hospital staff for their courageous and immediate response.
My heart goes out to the families of the people murdered and wounded in the horrific mass shooting at the UPS facility on SF's Potrero Hill.
#Arlington shooting has country on edge. SF police are now responding to a shooting w/several wounded. Violence solves nothing!
We must hold hands together and show the American people that we can work together, respect each other's positions, and find common ground!
Many members talked about threats to their lives and families. The vitriol must stop.
Incredibly emotional caucus meeting. Some real heroes among #Republican congressmen who shielded wounded Rep. Scalise this morning.
I also want to wish @SteveScalise and all those injured and impacted by the shooting this morning a swift recovery.
I want to thank our brave Capitol Police &amp; first responders in who saved countless lives in #Alexandria today &amp; who protect us every day.
At least 39 states' voting systems infiltrated by #Russian hackers in 2016 &amp; the silence from @POTUS is deafening. https://t.co/wiheQgWRwj

We must turn over every rock until all the potential misdeeds are exposed and the President is held to account.
All this goes entirely against the advice of his respected national security team.
As if that isn’t enough, he's planning to give back the seized properties within the U.S. that the Russians used to spy on us.
He struck a line acknowledging our NATO treaty commitments, which weakens the alliance to Russia's benefit.
He's been silent as Putin lied about Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The President has been silent as Russian jets buzz our ships in international waters and as Russian nuclear bombers loop off our west coast.
instead choosing to ignore Russian provocation – going as far as to praise Vladimir Putin.
Throughout the campaign and now as President, Mr. Trump has consistently chosen to take a pass on holding Russia accountable for its actions
Instead, the President remained solely focused on the welfare of General Flynn and himself, not the security of the American people.
about the national security implications of Russian intervention into our democratic processes.
But what I find most alarming is that at no time did President Trump convey to Mr. Comey any degree of concern
Why the loyalty to Flynn – is the President scared by the story Flynn said he has to tell when he sought immunity?
Mr. Comey’s testimony makes clear that the President sought to shield General Flynn, but was willing to throw everyone else under the bus.
He lied about who initiated their one-on-one dinner and why, and he lied about not asking Mr. Comey to lay off Michael Flynn.
Mr. Comey told it like it is, under oath: the President lied. He lied about why Comey was fired, he lied about the state of the FBI.
Yesterday's explosive testimony greatly strengthens the case that President Trump obstructed justice.

.@POTUS talks about national rebuilding --Then fund the electrification of #Caltrain instead of  scuttling it! #Jointsession #JointAddress
How do we pay for this? U can't cut taxes on corps, give tax cuts to the middle class, spend more on defense &amp; not raise the debt.
This is a repackaged campaign speech. #Jointsession #JointAddress
"Friends in the Muslim world." Never thought I would hear those words strung together by our President. Maybe there is hope. #Jointsession
It feels like I'm in an another country; one that doesn't believe in the rule of law. #Jointsession #JointAddress
