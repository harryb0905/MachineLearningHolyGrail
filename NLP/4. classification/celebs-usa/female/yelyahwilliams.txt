almost cried during the new Lion King trailer
i should proofread sometime... lol
also, i know it might seem a little trite how today we all post what we are thankful for today... but reading people’s thankfulness on the internet is such a nice break from the toxic crap we are typically exposed to here on a daily basis. love to all of you. hold your ppl close.
dont love this holiday, if i’m honest - but the sentiment of being grateful for &amp; humbled by your blessings, i like. im thankful for the band ive been in since i was a kid and the love and friendship. every lesson. for the ppl we’d have never met. the feeling. i know im lucky. ❤️
it’s over but the music ain’t. and sometimes i post a lot of nostalgia and un-released photos/videos on our band’s ig. not that it helps me deal with my own sentimental bullshit or anything... it’s alllll for you guys 👀. https://t.co/QS6wPK6HFw
kissed to consciousness. thanks Alfie. https://t.co/DGXUaaCE7W
@b3n_ja_m1n honestly weren’t hammered... we were about to lose 2 members of the band and we knew it and we were just delirious with sadness, love, anger and a very obvious possession of the christmas spirit.
where were you christmas 2010 while we were decking the mf halls? https://t.co/VgIR5ekT3W https://t.co/oJafaOnbzd

@trenchlive after laughter is the first one that is nashville to me. but grudges and pool were finished in LA and to me, for their own narratives, i think that’s fitting.
@punkxnug *big hugs* life is tough, i know. seasons are basic knowledge but somehow i forget spring is coming every single winter. just gotta hold on... what looks dead will come back more beautiful than you remember.
@trenchlive that whole record is set in LA, in my mind 😅
me: do not post a pic of LA and caption it with your own band’s lyrics about LA. it’s tacky.   also me: i gotta life out there/ somewhere it’s waiting/lined with palm trees and only new faces https://t.co/35fOoO62s2
@dakotaburnz @gooddyeyoung @rebelheartsgirl excuse me. 😭 i have to cry now. i love love.

@dyannafIowers @ColormeBrian @gooddyeyoung @phojoh @paramore that’s ok! it may not always show up exactly the same on different hair colors BUT depending on how you layer and style it, this pigment *WILL* show up. just remember, #PoserPaste is not a substitute for semi-perm dye. it’s an alternative that makes for a lotta wild styles.
@Paramore_OrLess @ColormeBrian @gooddyeyoung @phojoh @paramore used it every night on tour n i never sweatedddd it off 💁🏼‍♀️ i shampoo two times (1x to get color out &amp; 2x to get any left over residue/texture all the way out my hairs)
a pic from summer #tour5. hair by @ColormeBrian using our company  @gooddyeyoung’s temp hair color styling product (or Hair Makeup, if you will) #PoserPaste. washed it right out after the show 😉😉😉.   get some at https://t.co/ioHWOmTqeq   photo by @phojoh https://t.co/3lT90SGVCV

once i burped into the mic on a downbeat and laughed for the rest of the song. semi-veiled self-deprecation is kinda my vibe but i will def regret tweet this in the morning. https://t.co/W7W6hkD1w6

hope you all have a great rest of the week/weekend. it’s so weird to say this to millions of people at once. it’s ridiculous. whatever, i love you. (bye for now🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼)

@Veggie_Boii a great point! i ultimately will never care as much about which party as i do people. but in this video in particular, issues that i care a lot about are being spoken to in ways that i agree with by people from one party.

@IAmMackWilliams also, got bucked off a horse at 6 yrs old. incredibly terrified of em. wouldn’t dream of being on top of one, let alone one that was high! have a happy monday regardless of twitter- which is usually the worst.
@IAmMackWilliams get your point... but it’s not about blindly leading young ppl to do exactly as we (artists) do. it’s about using our space to empower them to actually vote rather than mocking them for being young. again, these ppl DO have their own convictions &amp; should not be underestimated.
maybe that’s enough twitter for a monday morning. hope you all have a blessed day. https://t.co/WqL9373AfK
read it/weep, ya old saltines. artists like @taylorswift13 &amp; hell, even my band... we’ve all worked hard to build community using our music &amp; our voices since we were 16. many ppl who support us grew up WITH us.   for instance, i’m almost 30. so are a shit ton of @paramore fans. https://t.co/kKbjR8uh2F
and who in their right mind underestimates a 13 year old girl anyway?!! who publicly mocks a woman’s political standings by dubbing an entire generation powerless? you don’t know the impact you have with your words... what fires you’ll start. use ‘em wisely.
🥁and here we have a man in power mocking a woman’s value and impact out of what i can only assume is fear. not fear of an election result but fear of a powerful woman who’s power he now realizes he can not benefit from. https://t.co/erPofnsFcS

@DVYDREVMING sometimes. i think?
@NZparamore @phojoh @ColormeBrian @gooddyeyoung yes, i use very little at a time. it helps if youre down for a conceptual look. the shit gets high concept pretty quick! but if you get around the lil learning curve, you can do a zillion looks with it.
@echoessfading @phojoh @ColormeBrian @gooddyeyoung it can be hard to find a diverse range of models who wanna let us mess with their hair all on the same day!! but!! Nashville is growing and our lil community is rad. we’re lucky to have such cool friends in this town.
ultimate fav from the Poser Paste new-shades shoot. Omot is such a glorious presence. here we don’t get to see her beautiful face - but her natural hair, covered in PPL Eater (GDY’s purple), with that complexion?!! im in love.  https://t.co/jQDI5qwgdL 💜💜💜 https://t.co/vXEuCmVRe5

metal health
@zanelowe youre the man at interviewing
why are all my tweets so wordy?
i’m late but @zanelowe’s interview w/ @tylerrjoseph gave me such hope for artists digging deeper into their own metal health/how that effects the conversation culturally. also loved hearing Tyler speak on faith &amp; his love for his wife Jenna (who I’m pretty sure is an angel).
@quinnmccoy evil surely abounds here, its why we got so many churches
i smell like camphor and menthol mixed with self-pity and i just really hope anyone in nashville tonight will think its a new and very nuanced fragrance i picked up from an indie beauty retailer and not actually just my last ditch effort at chigger-bite relief
*sighs loud enough for the whole world to hear* https://t.co/jaTDAFnvCT

mewithoutYou 🙏🏼🔥🙏🏼🔥 https://t.co/vLQD08i292
but! i try hard to call out and recognize joy when i feel it, or even when i see it on my friends. thankful for any chance to feel a genuine smile... not only on my face but deeper than that. if you feel darkness, i hope you’ll wait for joy. it will come again and it is worth it.
and i don’t always do it well... but i hope that if you struggle with darkness that you will try and remember to let yourself feel joy when it comes. im trying too. sometimes i feel like i probably look less “cool” or i worry that i’m somehow faking it.
yesterday was #WorldSuicidePreventionDay. really i just wanna say that when my mind was super dark and hopeless, there was a part of me that felt safe being cynical &amp; shut down. im trying to get healthier now... and it’s a lifestyle shift. sometimes it feels uncomfortable...
@NoCountryNash @paramore @pobenschain @roxymoure @NMAuditorium thank you so much 💧
blessing your timeline with empathy &amp; sincerity via this lovely human @DemetriusHarmon https://t.co/9GpP6gbWou

@ParamoreStreet omg
@cointheband @chselawrence @COIN the fact i ever wore these makes me question nearly every life choice i made post-THAT-purchase. shits actually starting to make sense now.
@SWEparamore @brandnewbecca @adorachloe @gooddyeyoung nooo dont think that. work aint easy ! but we have responsibility to ppl who care &amp; support. thank you 🙏🏼
TONITE: cry harder / dance hardest. https://t.co/RweIRzSboi
@brandnewbecca @adorachloe @SWEparamore @gooddyeyoung lol thank God for jokes or i mighta exploded this week. was a doozy. felt like a real frazzled dad from a 90’s movie.
@adorachloe @SWEparamore @gooddyeyoung as of now - as the lab is figuring out where the glitch was - we havent decided 100% what we will do. thanks for being supportive tho, thats an absolutely great idea! im tryina keep my head up as more exciting stuff is happening soon.
@SWEparamore @gooddyeyoung we have tested it on some of our own hair- with v SMS results. the lab did not make us aware but we caught it &amp; they’ll be fixing the problem (besides what got sent out) and getting it back to norm (which is what we tested &amp; approved.) sorry for the scare but we are on it 😫
@SWEparamore @gooddyeyoung its def an issue our lab did not make us aware when they should have. we opened the tubes and freaked! the swatch in person has no orange residue on it. and we will not be selling through all of the 1st shipment of SMS bc its just too freaky- even if the result is neon yellow.
jus a trim for the end of After Laughter https://t.co/PMf5BUX4kI
so much wild art and happiness will be hanging out at Art + Friends tomorrow. psyched to see it all in real life. https://t.co/0NpqkTeugZ https://t.co/D9elHSAvjz

for starters, something we felt was necessary was to change the base of Riot (our neon orange) from yellow to red. a redder undertone means you get a punchier, bit more aggressive orange 💥🍊😘 WE GIVE THE PPL WHAT THEY WANT! https://t.co/jQDI5qwgdL @gooddyeyoung https://t.co/ji7PhUfBiY
hanging with new packaging prototypes (by Nashville based creative agency @helloluum) for the new &amp; improved @gooddyeyoung. this has all been nearly a year in the making. what’s new you ask? pls hold, i’ll tell ya. https://t.co/Qqf7uSJKyT

@rebelheartsgirl @muskrathair @ohhayshelby i go to therapy and feel so refreshed afterward. sometimes when i vent to a friend for extended amounts of time or have a full-on mutual vent sesh with another person i just feel sour after. i think balance for me is learning which words are just empty or out of habit.
@rebelheartsgirl @muskrathair @ohhayshelby i think its an interesting take on something that ive been feeling a lot lately. i suppressed anger for many years and then had it all sorta explode outta me and am learning balance.
@xryanrussellx ✨💃🏼 thanks bud

yes, love to see this. ❤️🙏🏼 https://t.co/bNxvqfr6nB
AND 1 MORE THING — gettttttting healthy is a lifetime of process. kinda tired of folks treating mental health as an either/or situation. sometimes you’re just in the grey for a while, making your way to the light. (pls don’t shit on someone else’s journey to a less-dark place).
*sheeesh, ppl love to talk shit when you finally getting to a good spot.* learning this now: being unhealthy may garner some empathy from previous apathetic onlookers... but nothing beats getting consciously healthy w/ true love around you. misery’s romance will never compare.
@HeadCountOrg @paramore psyched yall are out here!
Thom this sounds great but im on a bus on my period surrounded by men https://t.co/3fSdXaNtAX

@KITTENTHEBAND oh he’s out there 👼🏻 #funkylove
@Iowkeybrit oh shoooot was it Brisbane?! im losin it. anyway yes, the GOMA exhibit was so inspiring. need to make more time for museum stops on the road, never a bad choice.
@Iowkeybrit no the Bonnaroo pride-inspired look ;), the Melbourne makeup was inspired by Yayoi Kusama!
@rebelheartsgirl as we get into it/get used to it more... it’ll only get better and more intuitive. i do plan on a few length blogs here and there. not yet, tho. 🤫

@AllofChe @gooddyeyoung @ColormeBrian havent had any trouble at our shows &amp; looord i sweat! it’s an oil based paste - so since oil &amp; water don’t mix it holds up pretty well to water/sweat.
@ode2trees @gooddyeyoung @ColormeBrian no itll work on any hair color/texture. just depends on the look youre going for. there’s a learning curve but it’s quite literally hair makeup. you gotta figure out the way you like to wear it. (my fav is wearing it globbed on &amp; kinda wet looking in my bangs).

@paperdoll @UrbanOutfitters @phojoh so sorry you couldnt find your size! we dont order the sizes for UO because it’s not our inventory but we can certainly make requests that they print the pmore designs on more sizes!
@CoachStough @UrbanOutfitters @phojoh UO doesnt? Hmmm we may have to ask that they remedy that. And typically, yes, our sizes for merch on tour always go up to xxl and usually xxxl too.
i keep forgetting to say we have clothes at @UrbanOutfitters right now. our friend/stylist @phojoh designed the mini-collection with After Laughter in mind. 💫💫💫💫💫💫💫 CHECK IT EEEEOUT. https://t.co/ASHpdQjpCj

A PSA: 29 years old is too old to play a secret club show, a set at @Bonnaroo, and a 1am Tom Petty tribute all in one week. should you choose this path, remember my words. heed my warning. ☠️

@mushroombeast sometimes i do, sometimes i dont - but most of the times i havent done it is when its not an official paramore tour show. i follow my ❤️🙏🏼.
@sra_potatohead whoaaa 😅 this is some extreme accountability. we like making shirts &amp; stuff with our artist friends - it helps them get a boost and makes merch actually fun for us again!
@StephDilts i gotta tell ya i dont remember this (probably because that was during a black hole in my life!) but i appreciate this level of connection via social media and i would like to apologize for any way i mightve steered that convo in the wrong direction! 🌻 happy sunday.
haven't been able to pick a photo to post on the band IG account because all the @bostoncalling photos are all v cool. thanks for hanging with us, it was so fun. https://t.co/4hXg1lANXb
@paracrazygirls @AlexMcElwee15 hahahahahah it had to go for so many reasons. betrayal amongst them.
coming back to the internet to see that ICE misplaced a LOT of children &amp; Trump said “our ancestors ‘tamed’ a continent”....  evil abounds and its wearing very self-righteous skin.

really proud of Jennea and Brian for opening up their lives to people. proud to say they have become family to my family. proud of my mom for using her heart &amp; gifts to help them on their journey. the film does their journey justice. 🙏🏼 also Korn is hard af, duh.
went to the nashville film festival premiere of @brianheadwelch’s film Loud Krazy Love. see this doc if you are in a dark place. see it if you believe in God but still feel abandoned. see it if you dont believe in anything but want to believe that your pain has purpose.
@annienonymous_ a few folks were asking so here it is. it made me feel calm too - thought it was perfect for this sunny day in nashville. hope you enjoy. https://t.co/ZuiOAbvr90
these kinds of deaths are becoming more and more frequent in our music communities. i cannot lie, it scares the shit out of me. all my heart goes out to the Frightened Rabbit family - band, team, and fans. so sorry.

@vikkibeexo @paramore the promotional side of what we do can feel pretty uncomfortable to us. think the colbert set was about us performing in an alternate world that v much looks like our own bubble- and me representing the nervousness of having people poke a hole in the bubble and peer in...

@sixfootpheebs @MellyPrince happened to see this &amp; want to weigh-in... we never preplan a miz biz unless there’s a crucial reason for needing to do it ahead of time, which is like 1% of the time. we risk letting ppl down with that gag every single night. sorry 💆🏼‍♀️

@ShadingLimelite MOM lol
say it every time but the 1st time we played manchester we met a v cool girl named Ellen who yelled out from the crowd that she worked at @hmvtweets &amp; told everyone at work about our 1st  album. thx Ellen. youre prolly the reason we can play a sick show in here 12 yrs later.

@HalfNoiseMusic congrats!

totally get that not everyone will love paramore or our show. a good review doesnt require praise... only openness to the experience. however, i appreciate this level of witness/presence/context. alright, no more ranting. swear! i love writers &amp; obv love paramore. (thx @readdork) https://t.co/tBzLoXfYUN
@justinmj hey, you saw it long before most did. thank you.
After Laughter is the point. it’s 100% okay if not everyone gets it. just dont use your review as a means to condescend a stage full of ppl (7) who all give a shit. if you cant at least appreciate what’s happening you may not actually know as much as you want ppl to believe.
dunno what some ppl expect the guys to do - but we arent the band thats gonna put zacs drum kit on a rig &amp; spin him around. taylor isn’t about to fly out of a canon whilst playing a thousand intricate parts. come to our show to see excellent live musicianship &amp; ppl who care.
will scratch my head forever @ the writers who come to a paramore show with minds made up, with absolutely no context or care to look past me just doing my actual job as a frontperson. &amp; who all but insult the INSANE fucking talent of every member of the band. touring or not.

okay, been @balletbeautiful-ing again since the start of #tour3. favorite way to workout since 2012. everything hurts... but in a nice way. you might wanna check it if you tryina get dat ass into shape. (&lt;3 you MH &amp; also @RainJPhoenix) https://t.co/PufbuNWeWT

but i try. scary to imagine ppl counting on you to speak into such complex issues in a way that serves everyone. i cant do that but i will continue to try and use empathy/compassion/self-care/humility when speaking on my experience and hope that it might be some kind of help.
realizing i get nervous now every time i get asked politically charged questions about being a female in music (or in the world?) bc there’s no good blanket statement - all our experiences are so personal. (btw i still get asked about Misery Business).
@AllThingsGo @Drake @brckhmptn @portugaltheman @paramore sick, thank you.

@NZparamore really wanted to see myself as a girl/not 1 of the boys. Funny to me now bc I don't see pink as particularly feminine.
@yelyaharmy well this was back before anyone knew me or Pmore. I think I did it to show myself first that it was okay to be/different.
@VEParamore early '14 was a tough time. Changed my hair 6 times by June. Turquoise was specific for Monumentour but felt like clarity for me
@paulaxsykes We are still in our infancy as a company. Lowering ship cost is priority as we grow/have the resources to lower cost!
@Pmore_Source I got into comic book art &amp; anime while we were recording Riot! Really wanted to look &amp; feel like a loud character.
@heavenevil_73 my hair has always been a reflection of my insides or a catalyst for growth. That medium of expression started around age 13?

@alessiacara loved hearing u sing Moana's song, stayed in our seats for the whole thing .. you killed it🏆
Moana was so good... and the short before it (Inner Workings) was amazing as well. So basically, I was a ball of emotions all night-&gt; 🎭
You are ferocious and lovely all at one time, just like a flame. (Thx for supporting GDY 💥🔥) https://t.co/3hg9aTlASj
@allsanddmusic so so happy for you guys. Congratulations!!!!
I'm so happy for @twentyonepilots! Josh &amp; Tyler, y'all have been my fav ppl to watch come up/take over. Can't wait to watch u win Grammy(s).
ppl may never really know ur heartache. (they'll talk about it. they'll misunderstand. but they'll never really know.) don't expect them to.
@avvayhq @DarkHorseRec wow this is amazing you guys!!
Just hopped back on the @balletbeautiful train after a year of just basically being a song-writing sloth. Ouch lol.

@BestCoast @Carahfaye ❤️
@LAYSHEAUX @BestCoast it's not the time for me to be sarcastic tho and reading true emotion thru a screen is near impossible. Standing w/ u.
@LAYSHEAUX @BestCoast that's actually not how I meant it at all... Was exaggerating the point that I'm not surprised at all &amp; it's tiring.
@gothickmum @gooddyeyoung you look glorious, thx for sharing!
@mewithoutYou 💔yep.
