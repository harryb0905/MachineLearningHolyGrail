@BoxOfLifeBox Don't talk about my child or I'll be forced to have Cliff track down your IP address and we will all embarrass you.
@BoxOfLifeBox I'm sorry you feel the need to hate people you don't know via the Internet. You are a sad little person crippled by jealousy.
Happy Sunday! http://t.co/Omd5eazm

@MissFemm he's so cute!
@RadhikaSao thanks for the support!!
@Xandersboy @nathanfillion hahahha I did, we had a good laugh about that!
@KayleeElayne the good outweigh the bad by like 99.9 percent. The 1% just change their screen names or get multiples, they have no power
@a_pointe thanks!!!

@SPNfreaks so does he.
@LoveForDanneel get we'll soon!xx
@Dovebyrd just trying to get more information on the company before we get involved:-) make sure it's all good!
@hausofdicarlo also we aren't sure where the money is coming from. It seems to be an offshore gaming company.
@hausofdicarlo yeah, then if you don't support them with a pic they call the charity and tell on you.
@Dona300 you have them. I pray/wish peace for your country and safety for your family.
@hausofdicarlo it's very strange to be offered up as a prize without consent.
@RebsNZ we are currently looking into this.
@RebsNZ I was not contacted by this company or ask what charity I am currently supporting.
@PerezHilton Beards!
@lauramccarthy94 hybrid witch sounds good.
@SPNfreaks go to school
@iAmKelseyx happy birthday! I hope it's been a good one!
@RingLady @storyaddict69 I took it with hipstamatic.

@Architaannie @she_dean7 why oh why would you need to know that!?!?
@MrsJessieReedus @ibreatheackles I love it. I am showing him this. I love his little bowlegs
@stephanie0moore @mrsjessiereedus no one wants to talk about that. Those guys deserve to be there too!
@stephanie0moore @mrsjessiereedus word!
@sueswank yes holding
@megmarie622 I like the character, I like tough guys. The brothers are cool, but that basically mirrors real life
@PetiteRach always yours petite
@lovaticlyrushin exactly.
@MrsJessieReedus thanks man!!
@iBreatheAckles he has bowlegs! Oh no!hhahaaa
@iBreatheAckles he is the sweetest. Love love love him. Damn he's in a lot of commercials
@MrsJessieReedus the fans should be upset by that.
@MrsJessieReedus they haven't and they haven't ever announced awards they have won at the live show. Weird
“@cadlymack: We need @DanneelHarris to guest star on Vampire Diaires. Homegirl just threw a PCA vote Ian's way. He's up against her husband.
@StoryAddict69 @danneelator yes my bad on that one. Apologies!
@VannyBoo or the opposite of it;-)
@StoryAddict69 yeah my bad. I got confused, sorry about that. People are being loco tonight.;-)
@LeoSPN93 of course not. Absolutely not
@t_atz no I'm going to pick favorites on that one.
@HGaudreau not sleep...math!
@_Eliann_ lighten up chick
@_Eliann_ talk 2 the people at the PCA's 2yrs in a row 2wins not even a mention/invite to the awards show.It's show itself that doesn't care
@_Eliann_ really? Wow. Nice attitude.
@sueswank @cadlymack hmmm..... Somerhalder???:-)))
@rdh04 no no...now that would be crazy. Jared would be devastated if he found out I loved Jensen more. Just devastated...

@Jamie_Rose89 That's a good one!!
@LianaGalassi that's great. He's a good guy

@Kriaaaa that's a great idea! Send me a pic next time you see one!
@bree_shell I know. It's true
@GodsAssociate Also, since when is microwavable Mac-n-Cheese and a little Dateline on TV promoting Satan. Is the microwave the devil's tool.
@GodsAssociate Doug,do a little research on Halloween or "All Saints Day". Not all Christians see it as a Pagan holiday, including this one.
My Halloween so far this year has consisted of microwaveable Mac and Cheese and 48 hrs on ID. I'm predicting more of the same. ;-)
@tellittothefrog awwww biscuit thanks!
@owenbailey8 thanks! I hope you have a good one too!

@16starsabove thanks you really made my day. I am a real person, just like you. My feeling get hurt the same.
@16starsabove I'm sorry. That really sucks, I simply wanted you to know what the group stood for. Let me know if I can help you.
@16starsabove I only asked why you followed the group?
@16starsaboveI hope you have a wonderful day and I am glad you dont agree with the death threats/cancer sentence.Hate,not death,it's a step
@16starsabove you are a young girl. I thought I could reach out to you, and let you know "what" you were following.
@CamillaTurini so much fun!!
@Out_of_London sure.
@ImAWerewolfGirl yep. Check out the website. I will be riding with supporters and soldiers
@taylorswipht13just keep being a really great friend.I know that can be hard but it is the right thing to do.Who knows...maybe in the future
@JGandJDorJ2 I'll him know.
@JellyFish_78 thanks, I know. Hope your days is great;-)
@JGandJDorJ2 @16starsabove I know. There is still time for her, she's 16!!!
@iCherryBlossomx hahhahaha! No. I love him, he is so crazy!!
@ImAWerewolfGirl @16starsabove that's why I singled her out. She looked from her pic too sweet to follow a group that is spreading hate.
@xdeemaaa no way! Makes me smile
@AndreCuIIen_ sure follow the link! Thanks!!!
@LunaMayKentros thanks for your thoughts! I am sure after college you will be able to give back. I have been there! Good luck
@raining_silence will do!!!
@OhaiShteve no way!! It's a compliment. He's hot!
@redteekal the bikes are stationary for 4 hrs
@SpnMaisieDaisy thanks we will send pics
@betterthanrain thanks do much!!!
@JGandJDorJ2 I wanted to clarify to you. Thanks for supporting Jensen and I. Love the pic:-))
@JGandJDorJ2 these people need to be held accountable. Don't follow a group that wishes death and passes around petitions seeking it.
@JGandJDorJ2 I will not apologize to anyone who follows a group that wishes me dead and/or to love with cancer.
@JGandJDorJ2 @16starsabove that is unfortunate, I don't want anyone to feel threatened including myself.
Thank you to everyone who has given so far.If you haven't donated yet,it's a great way to support our troops on 9/11.  http://t.co/w18tR1oP
These guys are the best! http://t.co/JmXAtbbD
@DanneelHate@16starsabove I was giving her a chance to get out before we take legal action.Death threats aren't taken lightly in our family
@16starsabove you say you love supernatural, I just showed your group to my husband and he was beyond upset that a fan of his supports this
@16starsabove Why do you hate me? Why do you support a group that wishes me to have cancer and die?
Thanks so much for helping meet my goal! Let's not stop yet! We have still have 2 days!  http://t.co/w18tR1oP

@DANNEELIsAHoe @alyssabil @vickyyn @hatersofdanneel how dare you say such things on a day this tragic. Have you learned nothing? Shame on U!
@Turmousaya you are right! But, It's hard not to take up for yourself!
@akeim it's okay.  She is probably 15. I hope she gets punished soon, and loses her computer privileges.
@sueswank @msanastasiabh @hatersofdanneel thanks. It's really sad that people act that way. It hurts my feelings.
@summerholt ratatouille!
@MsAnastasiaBH @hatersofdanneel for this reason I chose to have the surgery. I really hope you find something else to do with your time
@MsAnastasiaBH @hatersofdanneel I had tumors removed in both breasts at the age of 20. Leaving one decreased in size by 35%. I had them done
@MsAnastasiaBH @hatersofdanneel 1st of all that is a breast double you horrible person. 2nd I have never denied having a breast augmentation
The bus driver from Coney Island who caught the little girl as she fell from her apartment window:"Nah, man. A hero is a sandwich"

@Karlaaa95 @therobbiejones @sogopro  Happy 17th Birthday.
@jenvemk I kinda worry about people with that much hate toward someone they have never met. It can't be healthy
@akeim thanks people are so weird .
@vanessaspaz hey how are you?
@HATERSofDANNEEL you are a hurtful horrible girl, you deserve all the bad things karma throws your way.
@HATERSofDANNEEL as I told a friend of yours..you are doing much more damage to yourself with all the negative things you are putting out.
@HATERSofDANNEEL I am not a boring whore at all.
@HATERSofDANNEEL what is your real name? Send me a pic. I'd love to see how beautiful you are.
@Danneel_Ackles I'll find you.
@Danneel_Ackles also, I am having someone look into your account as we speak. I would delete.
@Danneel_Ackles I'm  sure your life sucks right now anyway.Otherwise you would have better things to do. You and everyone who follows you.
@Danneel_Ackles you are a horrible mean person who deserves the hard miserable life that awaits you.
@Danneel_Ackles keep it up. Something very bad is going to happen to you. All the negative stuff you send out is going to come back to you.
(null) http://t.co/Q7p3tfKN

@Team_stephanie1 I have a feeling something very bad is in your near future.....If I were you I'd sleep in my parents room tonight.
