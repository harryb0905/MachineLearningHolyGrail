Came across this today and it really spoke to me. 😉 Proverbs 22  8 Whoever sows injustice reaps calamity,     and the rod they wield in fury will be broken. 9 The generous will themselves be blessed,     for they share their food with the poor.
Woah! I just realized that shitty people think they're doing the right thing. #thegreatdivide
@Jorge_Z Woohooo!
I see your point but he's using my song without my permission &amp; commissioning money for being the songwriter. Youtube pays songwriters per video play and he's made about $18k that could go into my son's college fund or to help me make my next record. https://t.co/respwgmgu3 https://t.co/3WaDV6WHOt
I'VE HAD COFFEE THIS MORNING AND I'M PISSED!!
