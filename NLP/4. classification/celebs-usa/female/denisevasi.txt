I think @AmericanAir might be the only airline that doesn't allow families traveling w babies to board first. #notfamilyfriendly
@AmericanAir yes I'm aware you can pay for services, hence why we pay for 1st class but what about families who can't afford the extra cost?
Shame on @AmericanAir for not letting mommies w babies pre board. My 1st class ticket allowed me to board but what about moms who fly coach?
