Why did they bill this as a cat fight?sickens me.clearly the ice skating world was corrupt as we all see now.but what about poor Nancy?she just stayed quiet.when I sat w/her to give her tips on #DWTS she asked me, a Stanger at that pt..”why are u helping me”
What did nancy do?she WAS the victim &amp; was robbed of her dream &amp; innocence in all of this.ahe got grief instead of compassion.imagine this week if the eagles QB plotted&amp;took out tom Brady’s arm before the super bowl..there would be outrage&amp; more. It wouldn’t be oh “you two.”
Thread:FINALLY!i was sick watching it,sick seeing her praises!im still sick that they did this to Nancy.her life’s work gone..every sacrifice,everything gone!And then it was “you two?!!!”the lumped then together as equals..providing drama to the ice skating world? https://t.co/pBwdwr2hLs
