@koenfucius @buster @TimHarford I think this is like the experiment. If it is low cost, you can test/bet at low cost and you get a lot in return (often information) and you can iterate, that makes it a good bet/experiment.
@koenfucius @buster @TimHarford Ex. If you have to call $10 to win a $100 pot don’t think too hard. You have to win such a low percentage of the time and you get so much information when you call that you just do it.
@koenfucius @buster @TimHarford In poker there are many times where you get such a big payoff for the bet that you kind of shrug and play. I think this is really similar.

The more volatility in a stock, the more of a cash cushion you need.   The more volatility in the TSA situation, the more of a time cushion you need.   Volatility is costly.
Left for the airport an hour earlier than usual today because of TSA uncertainty.   As the variance of wait increases you have to leave more time.   Wide confidence intervals are costly.  Not unlike why the market likes low vol stocks?

@jlevine If we are making good decisions along the way, whether it is art, or music, or investing, we will create for ourselves the best results within the range of what we are capable over the long run.   5/5
@jlevine Along the way, we need to find a way to hold ourselves accountable to executing our plans and not get caught up emotionally in whether things turn out well or poorly.   4/
@jlevine So I think what we are trying to do is set goals, figure out what a good result is for us, look ahead to figure out what we think the best way to achieve that good result is, and make a plan to execute.   3/
@jlevine 2) My right answer may be different than yours because we have different values and different goals. There is very little for which there is an objectively right answer for that is the same for everyone.   2/
@jlevine Great question, Josh.   First, pretty much everything is subjective in two senses 1) as long as there is hidden information and unknowns we are always guessing at what is “right”.  1/

@JamesClear Maybe there is a sweet spot for pace of feedback?  Too slow is bad but really fast is also not great?
@JamesClear Also, very fast feedback increases activation of the limbic system since there is no time in between outcomes to calm down. Creates more decision-making when not in a decision-fit state and distortion of how you process feedback…
@JamesClear Do you think the curve might be more of an inverted U shape?   In my experience, very fast feedback can interfere with learning as it exacerbates path dependency, recency effect, etc.

You can make a really good decision *given the info you have* that has absolutely no chance of good outcome.   That is one of the influences of luck.   You can have bad luck that the info you need in order to *know* that there was no good outcome is completely hidden from view.

@McAkins I’m not away of a candidate polling at 90% and losing (not close to the election anyway). Clinton, for example, wasn’t polling at 90%. She was polling at +2%. Some models had her 90% to win.
@tvoteformazie Haha!
@jben0 @kipthegreat Love this! Great image!
I agree it’s important to keep track of forecast quality to assess any model. (Brier scores?).   I like the idea of seeing how the model would do if it bet.   Looking forward to the results. https://t.co/P9lIl27LTC
@kipthegreat This is such a great idea to give an analogy if something someone has experienced a lot. I said recently the chances of the Dems taking the house are the same as flopping bottom set against top two pair and having it hold with two cards to come.
20/20 Once I put it in the context of a bet, the uncertainty in the outcome bubbles to the surface and we can see more clearly that it isn’t a sure thing. END OF THREAD.  #2018Elections #Polls #Forecasts
19/ To put this into context, if I offered you a bet on a coin that would land heads 28% of the time, would you bet your life on the coin landing tails? NO!
18/ I think we would all be better off if we all participated in prediction markets like @PredictIt which would force more probabilistic thinking and a little more Thinking In Bets, otherwise known as “put your money where your mouth is.”
17/ And then when a favorite is upset, the public declares the polls wrong and our trust in expertise corrodes, not because the forecasts were wrong but, rather, because the public and the pundits interpreted what the polls/forecasts meant poorly.
16/ We want someone to tell us who is going to win but no reasonable forecast can really do that. In our heads, once there is a heavy favorite, we default to processing that as a prediction of who will win for sure. Pundits oblige by offering certainty where none exists.
15/—partly due to differences in the size of a state and/or the homogeneity of the state. Here’s a great piece explaining this from 2016.   https://t.co/WUs9n0gY6l
14/ Also polling quality is generally better quality at the national level than the state level (even while state polls are better inputs into forecasts of a national election in the US) and, even at the state level, polling quality varies significantly
13/ They are like a mock vote taken the day of the poll and how much signal the poll provides for predicting the final outcome depends on the polling methods. That is why @fivethirtyeight grades the polls.
12/ Cherry picking when polls miss by a lot to claim they are bad data is kind of like saying the line in an NFL game was 7 but one team one by 12 so lines are stupid! The point is that POLLS ARE DATA NOT FORECASTS.
11/ The author cherry picks a bunch of past races where the polls were way off the final result. First, I can also cherry pick a bunch of races where the polls were dead on (like the prediction that Clinton would win the national vote by 2% to 3%).    https://t.co/C8kuw3Er77
10/ I saw some of this reinforced in this @PeterHamby piece in @VanityFair which dunked on a lot of the punditry but also basically says we should not trust the polls. Polls are not meant to be predictive! They are inputs into a forecast or a prediction market.
9/ he won so obviously the forecast was wrong because less than 30% obviously means ZERO PERCENT so now we should totally ignore 538’s forecasting around the midterms.    Here’s one example of that but a quick search pulls up a ton of them: https://t.co/6hDlC0MBIu
8/ You can see that error in a lot of the chatter from people saying that we should ignore the forecasts because @fivethirtyeight had Trump slightly less than 30% to win the presidency on 11/8/2016 and &lt;GASP&gt;
7/ That is why this tweet is so funny: https://t.co/eus1d1hiZX
6/ tell a good story and then they over-hype those polls, which are often outliers. If a forecast shows a heavy favorite, the pundits act as if it is 100% that the favored candidate will win, reinforcing that error in the public.
5/ Pundits really are a lot of the problem here as they express things with way too much certainty and get way to excited by a single poll showing a race tightening. They are often looking for attention grabbing headlines rather than the truth so they cherry pick polls that ...
4/ Here’s a good example of that desire for certainty:  https://t.co/CcMBwhe2rY
3/ Certainty is what people want. They don’t want to hear that one candidate is 25% and the other 75%. They want to know for sure. And the pundits are often more than happy to give them what they want, offering more certainty than the data offers.
2/ so if they lose we declare the forecast (or the polls) wrong! This is, of course, aided and abetted by a lot of pundits. It’s very frustrating because I am not sure how we can fix the problem.
THREAD.   1/ I was looking through twitter today and saw how much people mistrust forecasts of the election. We are pretty bad at thinking probabilistically and it seems as if once a candidate is somewhere over 60% we default to assuming they are 100% to win

@TypeRMrG @NollaigMul @bphabsy @Porketh @rs_hole @mattmars @ScottyLizard @Nihonbashicap @tferriss @angeladuckw Once you realize the future is always uncertain and you can’t ever be 100% sure of any decision or have control over the outcome, it is easier to actually go ahead and decide.

I am sad to see CNBC perpetuate this confusion between polls and forecasts/betting markets. Also sad to see the resulting here…declaring that because Remain won that the polls were more predictive because they were closer. So much misinformation here. 8/8
Track the political polls as they come out and see how they affect forecasts and betting markets. Follow @FiveThirtyEight to see how polls and forecasts are related and @PredictIt to see how polls and betting markets are related. 7/8
If Remain polled at, say, 60% many months out, your confidence that Remain would win is much lower than if it polled at 60% the hour before, in which case you might forecast that Remain would win close to 100% of the time assuming your polling methods were sound. 6/8
A narrow difference in a poll SHOULD result in a large gap in a betting market assuming the poll is taken close to the vote. Polls are more predictive the closer to the event that they are. 5/8
So just because the polls had Leave and Remain closer percentage wise than the betting markets doesn’t mean that the polls were more right than the betting markets just because Leave won. Just as if Remain won it wouldn’t mean that the betting markets were more right. 4/8
The betting odds are a prediction of what the outcomes will be over many trials. A poll is the outcome of a single survey. 3/8
Polls are kind of like a mock vote. Polls are a snapshot of a particular moment in time and are an INPUT into a forecast or bet. Polls are data, inputs into a model, while a bet is the output of that model.   2/8
THREAD ⬇️  Just came across piece on @CNBC from 2016 which seems to completely miss the difference between a poll and a forecast. The piece declares the polls were more accurate than the betting markets in Brexit. There is a lot to unpack here.   1/8   https://t.co/8FWO6Akf8e

@jposhaughnessy @brianportnoy Tribe is committed to more unconventional choices that create alpha in the long term and committed to withstanding short term fluctuations.
@jposhaughnessy @brianportnoy This is a great example of taking aspects of tribalism that cause dysfunction in public discourse (belongingness, distinctiveness, epistemology) and turning them to the good. Using tribe to get behavior to align with long term interest.
@jposhaughnessy I agree and I think leaders create environments where the space to succeed unconventionally is scarce. Many people cannot/will not take the risk of getting fired for a bad outcome from a non-consensus choice.

@SergeyIRL ... Qualities of the decision maker: the ability to remember and internalize the good process so that the outcome does not feel inevitable.
@SergeyIRL I think that would go more into habits of mind that the decision maker has made combining with qualities of the decision itself. Qualities of the decision: deep probabilistic scenario planning so the risks/rewards and possible outcomes have been well anticipated prior to decision

@SergeyIRL Short term the results felt so important though! That was the big struggle...to try to stay focused on the long run as much as possible.
@SergeyIRL Another great question. Long term was much more about progress in the game, deepening understanding, broader realization of how much I didn’t know, and, most important, the relationships I formed.
@SergeyIRL I agree that regret can be just about the result. And a reason I like thinking about regret long after the result (say a year after) is that you get much more of a view, less tethered to the immediate result, that way.

@AdamMGrant We exchanged information and now Lila and I have lunch every two weeks.   That is a great mentor.    &lt;end story&gt; :)
@AdamMGrant It turns out she had followed my career and was proud of what I had accomplished. After all, I could not have accomplished what I did without those five years that Lila mentored me.
@AdamMGrant Then seven years ago I randomly ran into her in a doctor’s office. I got up the courage to go say hello and her face lit up! She was excited to see me! The first thing she told me as I sat down next to her? “I’m really proud of you.”   So obviously I cried.
@AdamMGrant She was not just my mentor but my friend and by not continuing in academia I was letting her down. Letting her legacy down.   I felt I had betrayed her.
@AdamMGrant For years and years, I was so ashamed. I thought Lila was mad at me, embarrassed of me. I avoided her because I thought I had failed her. This woman had put so much time into me. I don’t think I have ever had more admiration for someone’s intellect than I have for Lila’s.
@AdamMGrant When I finished graduate school I got really sick. That’s when I started playing poker, to support myself while I got better. At beginning I planned to go back to defend my dissertation and become a professor. But I never did. I kept playing poker and never finished up my degree.

It’s likely our minds are telling us the photos are from different angles because of the diagonal lines.   A famous example from the @BusinessInsider article: the café wall illusion.     #opticalillusion https://t.co/1ipKPHzxK7

@Liv_Boeree Unexpected use of multiverse! :)
Confused by critique of @natesilver538 in piece though. It doesn’t seem like Silver could have both said Trump stood no chance of winning &amp; Trump had 29% chance of winning at same time. Track record matters, not a single forecast. And Nate Silver has a very good track record. https://t.co/oxWpTmX2fo
Assigning probabilities to predictions not w/intention to accurately make a prediction but as a way to be right if the outcome goes your way and not wrong if it doesn’t. Of course, only works as a short term strategy since long term record will matter. Interesting new wrinkle. https://t.co/py0PD9BQdk

@TheMayorPete @Portfolio The key is to set a deadline for making the decision and stick to it because waiting to decide until you are certain is unrealistic.
@TheMayorPete @Portfolio It completely depends on the decision. Some decisions must be made very quickly (like swerving to avoid an obstacle in the road). Some can be much longer cycle (like forming a strategic plan.
@jbrunettinc @portfoliobooks @penguinrandom When imagining how things will turn out, don’t avoid imagining scenarios where things don’t work out. We like to imagine success. But success is harder to achieve if you don’t anticipate and plan for the ways you might fail.
@SeanAtch41 @portfoliobooks @penguinrandom Sometimes that input will sway you one way or another. Also, if you  do basically flip a coin, commit to not be sad when the outcome goes  against you or overly happy when it does.
@SeanAtch41 @portfoliobooks @penguinrandom If you are truly split, then you have landed on a 50/50 so both decisions are equally likely to work out. Basically flip a coin there. But before doing that, make sure you seek input from others without signaling that you are split.

@dreamdoc_ja When we do that, we are making the optimal decision as we are choosing the thing that is the least bad, which is a way of optimizing (2/2).
@dreamdoc_ja It is very often that we have to choose among possible decisions, none of which are likely to result in a good outcome. In that case, we are working to choose the best of the set of unappealing decisions. (1/2)
@SDBookReader Rehashing the past will make people defensive. Talking about how to improve in the future makes them think about the past without direct confrontation. (2/2)
@SDBookReader It’s always important to make sure no one is emotional at the time. So avoid discussion immediately after a bad outcome. In general, it’s best to focus on how to improve going forward rather than rehash the past also.(1/2)
@pondandwoods especially if we use intuition alone. Without rational assessment, especially getting other people to check our bias, our decisions won’t be optimal. Other people act like that extra mirror that helps to cover our blind spots. (2/2)
@pondandwoods Intuition is often experience speaking to us but our gut feeling is also very biased. It’s like a visual illusion. We can’t help seeing the illusion. Same with things like confirmation bias, or availability bias or hindsight bias, etc. It’s hard not to fall prey to them, (1/2)
@CTSweeper @portfoliobooks @penguinrandom Remembering can never get to a place of being 100% the decision is correct helps you stick to the deadline.
@CTSweeper @portfoliobooks @penguinrandom Generally, decisions have built-in time-limits because we have deadlines. If the time is open-ended, make an educated guess on how long it will take you to consult the right people and gather relevant information then set yourself a decision deadline. Stick to it.
