I feel like this isn’t an original thought, but every time I pass a billboard/sign for this new “the masked singer“ TV show, I just think it’s a For Your Consideration ad for Black Mirror.

Which we paired with @Coomi_PR Jewels, @SigersonShoes pumps and a @YSL clutch.
As many do for events of this kind, my stylist @NikiSchwan &amp; I reached out to designers and showrooms. ...No one was responsive. Luckily, @westerncostume generously opened the doors to their private vintage archive, and we chose this 1930’s dress and 1940s hat.
Thank you to everyone inquiring about today’s dress! Here’s the real story:

&amp; yes, I know @metacritic can be a problem, as it’s been reported to be used as an excuse to not give human beings bonuses after they’ve given their lives &amp; health to shipping a game, but as it’s the games industry’s rotten tomatoes, I respect how a creator would take it srsly.
I can’t imagine killing myself, making a game every day for half a decade, then knowing it has to go into the world, and then refreshing @metacritic and seeing it’s regarded as perfect.

@BestBuySupport it's lack of regard for customer experience that has exacerbated this, and, now, pretending policy was the whole point.
@BestBuySupport lulz. "don't get me wrong." The whole point of calling ahead was to make sure this WASN'T a situation. I understand policy.
@BestBuySupport Understood. Hence calling ahead for a CC autho sheet, or ANY information like this, ahead of time, so we wouldn't waste time
@BestBuySupport I tried to call, to either do that, or ready them for a person, walking in, with my credit card.
@BestBuySupport Tried to call ahead to do a CC autho. Utter disregard, in person, even after explanation of situation.
@BestBuySupport complete lack of effort to help remedy our situation. And this was with an asst manager.
@BestBuySupport This just got worse. A director from my production company just had to leave, b/c they were unwilling to help.
