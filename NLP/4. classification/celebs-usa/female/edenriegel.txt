So glad this sweet birthday baby was born. I know this will be hard to believe, but he’s even sexier now! @MillerLoLife https://t.co/fWA8NlVt1M
This look gives me life. @theebillyporter is a god among peasants. Awestruck. https://t.co/x8dntwASV0
@emrazz My only issue with your awesome tweet is we should be calling them vulvas. Vagina is the part men are interested in because it’s where they put their penis. The vulva is the whole gorgeous kit n’ caboodle, internal, external, and the glorious clitoris.
@Chrishell7 Agree 100%! No present opening at our baby shower, but we did have a margarita machine and mariachi band. You do you!!!
@dhewlett Ha! That’s hilarious. Poutine and snow! Congrats, Jane! I wish I could join that elite club!!!
@gregrikaart Your foot looks like… something else.

@TheDweck You’re good at twitter.
@Mistyrose78 @TTag011 Oh no! I’m so sorry she is caught up in this. I thought what she said is so beautiful. And gave him comfort obviously. I hope I didn’t add to the grief. If she wants me to I will delete my tweet.
@TTag011 Oy! Once again: this website=a cesspool smh That’s not what the quote means. I think it’s important to normalize grief. I know you get me!
@TTag011 Oh dear I didn’t know!!!
Sad news today about the passing of @kristoffstjohn1. I only worked with him briefly but his kindness and light made an enormous impression. Wanted to share the last tweet he retweeted because it is both prophetic and profound. I hope he is at peace. https://t.co/mWwCmKJgIr
@MU_Dac @OneDayAtATime No not it this season, I just have really good taste!!

Heartbroken that my 5-year-old learned from his friend yesterday that people come into schools and shoot children. He is now scared to go to school, and wonders how I can be so sure no one will come into our house or his school with a gun. Well I can’t, really. #GunControlNow

Happy New Year to those who celebrate. 😜

I’m exhausted. Vote early, vote by mail, vote Nov 6th, drive friends and relatives to vote, drive strangers to vote, encourage everyone you know to vote, vote on a provisional ballot if they will not let you vote. Just vote.
Our President is a White Nationalist. Please vote November 6th.

Press: women out of doors who simultaneously posses a body are not “showing off” anything. They are out of doors, while simultaneously possessing a body. It’s our space, too. Enough.
@TheRealAzeranth It’s clearly not small, as the earth is warming. Already by 1 degree. I’m sure you think you’re very smart but I’m inclined to believe scientists.
@TheRealAzeranth “Since 1955, over 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases has been stored in the oceans (Figure from IPCC 5th Assessment Report).”
@TheRealAzeranth The article I linked states no such thing.
@TheRealAzeranth Co2 is the second largest contributor to global warming. Water vapor is the  first. Steam is the main byproduct of the burning of fossil fuels, which creates a positive feedback loop as highrr temperatures result in more water vapor. Pls Cite actual articles and studies.
@TheRealAzeranth According to NASA: “These natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.” https://t.co/4piWpXWPVt
@TheRealAzeranth But during the ice age carbon was at 200ppm. It makes an enormous difference. Lemme ask you this, Why do you you think the earth is warming, if not carbon in the atmosphere?
@samriegel @TheRealAzeranth Gotcha
@TheRealAzeranth @samriegel Preindustrial levels of co2 concentration hovered around 280ppm. Current levels are 410ppm. Estimated about 100ppm higher than anytime in the last 15 million years. And accelerating.

This is compelling. There needn’t be enough evidence to convict in a court of law. A credible accusation casts doubt on a nominee for a lifetime appointment, and threatens to delegitimize the court. The burden is on the nominee to be above reproach. https://t.co/ujiU7cRLau

@71_brad @DuckDodgers24c @JackPosobiec @MMFlint Separate the HSI unit from the ERO unit into two distinct entities, so HSI can do the valuable work it needs to do. Increased oversight so the President can’t use ICE as a personal police force. Prioritize deporting criminals again.
@2cndamendment @DuckDodgers24c @JackPosobiec @MMFlint I do know what ICE does.

@2cndamendment That's, um... you're... okay with that? You don't think maybe someone should try to stop that?  (And yes, it is sow.)
@DuckDodgers24c @JackPosobiec @MMFlint ICE needs major reform. That's just true. But, yeah, the Russians are trying to fuck with our system and sew distrust. They'll probably try to help the Democrats next as an attempt delegitimize our elections. Which is why we think Trump should be doing something about it.
@DuckDodgers24c @JackPosobiec Well, since the Russion trolls posting on facebook are in Russia, my guess would be... zero? That's kinda why they use the internet.

@tjb1017 I’m not trying to be annoying. Well, maybe I just am naturally. You’re a thoughtful person who I know cares about these issues. Please don’t take my nit picking personally.
@tjb1017 I get we have differing opinions on this. But this is not what you were saying before, that it was dangerous or caused harm. I think we all need to be inconvenienced big time right now. Our govt is not functioning. No one should feel good, and have a nice, easy time till it is.
@merrikenny I’m still unclear as to how this put anyone in harm’s way. It’s the very definition of a peaceful protest. And I’m happy to get this issue on TV no matter how it’s accomplished. Bravo, I say. Bravo!
@jpierce0101 No I’m not. I wish I were as good as this.
@merrikenny I guess I don’t see how it put people in jeopardy. As for those inconvenienced, I’m more concerned with those inconvenienced by having their kids taken from them. Things shouldn’t feel comfortable right now. We’ll miss that nothing at all is normal. Keep fighting, my friend.

@debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin We were at the hight of the buggest recession in a century during the first year of Obama’s presidency. Trump was handed an already strong economy. Unemployment has continued to drop under trumo at a lower rate than obama’s last term.
@babyspicezin @debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon Here. CNN money. july. Happy? https://t.co/EAMeM2DEna
@babyspicezin @debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon It’s the week. It’s an american magazine. That’s just the link. There are thousands.
@OLTLfreak2009 @longislanddon @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @babyspicezin I didn’t ask you to respect me. But why are you writing to me if you don’t? If you don’t Pls let me know and I won’t bother to respond anymore. (PS i never said he wasn’t my president. He provably is.)
@OLTLfreak2009 @longislanddon @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @babyspicezin I was saying you were trying to be mean to me.
@debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin I posted a more recent article for you. Truly not much has changed since sept but you’re right, I didn’t look at the date. My mistake.
@debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin Quick google search returns hundreds of articles. Try it sometime.
@debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin Here’s one from a week ago.  “But the average monthly gain under Trump is 181,000 jobs, which is nearly 17% below the monthly average of 217,000 during Obama’s second term.”  https://t.co/eNVcZOsymf
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin That’s an amazing catch 22 you’ve created for yourself. Anything that conflicts with your world-view is labelled as bunk and you never have to really consider any issue. I hope you can learn to tolerate uncertainty. It’s a much more interesting way to live.
@OLTLfreak2009 @longislanddon @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @babyspicezin I just want to point out how hard you’re working to be mean. I wish you’d put your effort into something worthy of this life you have. It’s so short, our time here on earth. My opinion of myself is strong, I can’t be bruised by your words. But I wish you could see me as a person.
@debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin I know this will make no difference to you. But... https://t.co/LuJyYQgfHV
@OLTLfreak2009 They do have the right to be here.
@OLTLfreak2009 @babyspicezin It was a reply to another person.
@OLTLfreak2009 @ernestine_12 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin On my timeline I don’t allow attacks. Don’t at me.
@OLTLfreak2009 @ernestine_12 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin This country enslaved her people and was built on their abuse and suffering.
@babyspicezin Jesus this is so wrong I don’t know where to start. I can’t help you.
@OLTLfreak2009 @ernestine_12 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin That’s patently not true and I won’t allow it here.
@babyspicezin They benefit me quite a lot. And poor and middle class people not at all. It’s trickle down economics and it does not work. Is your personal economic situation any better?
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin You’re right. But many muslims are brown.
@babyspicezin I’m sorry, you’re wrong.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin Mental health professionals do not agree with you.
@babyspicezin I am so sad you refuse to look into this yourself. Your mind doesn’t need to remain closed.
@OLTLfreak2009 @ernestine_12 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin She doesn’t deserve to be told to leave her own country. We are free to have different opinions here. I don’t think it’s helpful to attack each other. Please don’t attack people on my timeline.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin The muslim ban is a racist policy that does not make us safer. Foreign pilicy experts on both sides of the aisle agree with that statement.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin Being trans is not a mental disorder. I beg for empathy and understanding. You love the military, these are people who have sacrificed for us. Young trans people are some of our most vulnerable and should not be targeted with bathroom laws.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin I don’t approve of the Embassy move to Jerusalem. It exacerbates an already heinous situation.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin Unemployment has continued to shrink absolutely at the same rate it did under Obama. There’s no difference at all.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin Handing a political win to Kim Jung Un, who continues to expand his nuclear program. Allienating our closest allies. Slowing the economic growth we’ve experienced the last 7 years. And targeting immigrant, muslim, and trans people needlessly.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin What has he done? A stolen supreme court appointment. Yes. Tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and huge corporations that haven’t helped workers. Undermining the ACA. A tariff war that’s causing american companies to move jobs overseas and hurting consumers.
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 @JoeyKing @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb @dav_knox @longislanddon @babyspicezin As much as I deplore the man and his policies, he is absolutely my president and this is my country. And I have a right to free speech and free expression. And that right seems to drive you crazy.
@AreSsunshine Requesting asylum is not illegal.
@debcos54 @SamIsGonzo1978 @DeplorableDeb @OLTLfreak2009 @brunnhilda1023 @HayleyErin @Tea4Freedom @DeirdraMontgom4 @longislanddon @audreywhitby Requesting asylum is not illegal.
@debcos54 @OLTLfreak2009 Of course I care about Veterans. I abhor how they’re treated. The least we can do as a nation is take care of those who fought for us. I just donated generously to the VA. I do so wish we had avoided needless conflict in Iraq so there were fewer veterans.
@OLTLfreak2009 I have an american flag on my profile 11 out of 12 months of the year. I love my country.
Do not at me with your nonsense. I will not respond to it anymore. Stop accepting propaganda (read: lies) as fact.
For the last time (I pray.) The law you’re talking about states that families must be kept in the LEAST confining conditions possible, and must receive a hearing or be RELEASED after 20 days in detention. The policy Trump enacted was NEW and was put in place to SIDESTEP the law. https://t.co/GlenuXF9Ko
@WhiteRabbitDave @NancyWilson Requesting asylum is not illegal.
Yes! This! ⬇️ So well said. https://t.co/lysgA9FhAD
Why we march. https://t.co/Fw4WnFAwtL
@OLTLfreak2009 Tell me what I should have protested under Obama.
@OLTLfreak2009 And yeah, we’re gonna complain about injustice, corruption, and the degradation of norms and the rule of law. So get used to it.
@OLTLfreak2009 Angry much? You guys have control of every party of government. Why are you so bothered that I’m exercising my right to free expression, peaceful assembly, and dissent? Why do you feel the need to name call? It debases you.
We also wanted to voice our opposition to Trump attempting family separation again. (Also, I very much doubt Matt Mercer would endorse your use of his image.)
We demonstrated for the reunifications of the over 2,000 families still separated. And in opposition of overturning the Flores Settlement that states children must be kept in the least confining conditions possible, and must be released after 20 days. https://t.co/jaK9Mh5RKd
@longislanddon @OLTLfreak2009 @HayleyErin @JoeyKing @debcos54 @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb How come this is supposedly her website? How come she's using some author's book cover as her profile pic? https://t.co/quw5sT5FDg
@OLTLfreak2009 @HayleyErin @JoeyKing @debcos54 @longislanddon @Tea4Freedom @DeplorableDeb Preeeeeety sure that person is fake. But you probably knew that and that’s why you sent me a screencap and not a link to the tweet.

@ganghan9 I hear you. I'm glad my caring makes you feel even a teensy bit better. We're all in this together and we have to fight for each other.
@longislanddon @OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl See my previous tweet. Also, many ports of entry are now closed or so backed up they're essentially closed. So what are people fleeing credible threats meant to do?
@longislanddon @OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl You can present yourself at any border and request asylum. That's the law of the land. By definition asylum-seekers are fleeing violence and terror. So they're allowed to cross where they can and ask for asylum.
@longislanddon @OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl You should receive a hearing from a judge for saying "I want asylum." You should have the right to prove your case. And you shouldn't have your kids taken away with no way to get them back. That's all I'm saying.
@Chrisdisgusted @WendyMolyneux I gotta ask. Who’s the first?  I know it makes you feel good to call names. Just know I can take it. I’m a white, rich, educated citizen. I would way rather you come after me than anyone else.
@longislanddon @Artonthe13thFl @OLTLfreak2009 He’a saying they contribute to the economy and tend to take jobs unattractive to native born workers (because they’re available.)  Also, requesting asylum isn’t illegal.  Carry on...
@OLTLfreak2009 @debcos54 I have blocked exactly 8 accounts ever. And your friend’s is not one of them. I just checked.
@longislanddon @OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl Requesting asylum is not illegal. And I bet legal imigrants would be completely fine with anyone’s HUMAN RIGHTS (to habeas corpus and due process) not being violated, thank you very much. No one is jumping the line.
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl Dear me. You make me sad. I'm gonna go do something else now.
@sandee0802 @leahkrevit @MBsandsKU @laurenduca This made me laugh and that is not easy today!!!
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl Didn't say he wasn't.
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl What do you do?
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl Handouts? Huh? You mean huge tax cuts from your president? Why, yes I did. Didn't want them, though. I voted for the other candidate.
@Artonthe13thFl @OLTLfreak2009 Oh, thanks!! I think you're killing it. Dropping the knowledge, keeping it respectful. You rock!
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl It makes you feel better to call names, doesn't it? In the long run, though, it erodes your sweet, vulnerable soul.
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl My god you don't. You're in a safe space of ignorance, anger and fear. Please don;t inflict it on those weaker than you. I am white, I am rich, I am privileged. I can take it. Direct your hate on me.
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl You're demonstrably wrong and refuse to hear reason. This conversation, if you can call it that, scares the shit out of me.
@Artonthe13thFl @OLTLfreak2009 It is awful that you don't know this. How many more of you are there out there who don't? Why do you not know basic things about the country you claim you love?
@OLTLfreak2009 @Artonthe13thFl You're wrong. Anyone on US soil, regardless of how they got here, are protected by the US Constitution's right to due process. You live in a democracy, bro. Govt of the people, by the people, and for the people. Look into this stuff before you go spouting off on Twitter.
@OLTLfreak2009 My dear your facts are wrong. Obama was dealing with a wave of unaccompanied minors at the border. Most 15-17. He prosecuted border-crossing families only in particular and rare circumstances. Like an adult was carrying drugs. Trumps zero-tolerance policy is brand new.
@ganghan9 I'm so sorry you're so scared. I'm with you. You are wanted by me.
@OLTLfreak2009 Thank you! No it's not. We agree.
@OLTLfreak2009 @Juleslxs I see your strategy. Any debate you're gonna lose just turn it into an abortion debate! Then you think you win. That's just adorable and so sad.
@OLTLfreak2009 Um. They only have rights because we're fighting for them. How is this not clear?
@OLTLfreak2009 What I really don't understand is how a debate about whether kids should be tortured at the border becomes a debate about abortion. That's absurd. Literally absurd. It's like from an existentialist play. It makes my mind spin.
@OLTLfreak2009 I care about actual living children. Do you? It's not one or the other, you know. You can care about both. Also, I don't think women are just vessels for what you define as life. They are humans, and should have the agency to determine what happens to their bodies.
@OLTLfreak2009 I don't stop caring about kids after they're born.
I don't understand. Kennedy cares about LGTB rights. He cares about balance and justice. How can he do this? How can he want that guy to name his replacement?
@USC_Mom Not political. Just truth. #byeback #IDontReallyCareDoU
Ladies, if you have the means, get an IUD now. Abortion rights are threatened in the next SCOTUS term. Fellas, get those tubes snipped. All us broads are gonna be handmaided.

Ooh ooh, I like this one, too. (Thanks ⁦@WendyMolyneux⁩) Guys, I’m really starting to dig this idea.  https://t.co/bZcd7u3L0o
I performed at Tiffany Trump's 2nd bday party in the Trump Tower penthouse suite. I sang "I'm a little teapot" &amp; other favorites. I was maybe the only subcontractor Trump paid in full. $100 cash. I was a kid but I knew the guy had a black hole where his soul was supposed to be. https://t.co/bzXt1k6SF1
The replies to my tweet yesterday (re Red Hen/SHS) were thoughtful, thought-provoking and civil. Thank you for helping me make sense of this issue! This thread (provided for me by @vonrubular) sums up why it’s, indeed, appropriate to deny service to the Press Sec. https://t.co/7NdFVbaQcU
P.P.S. I definitely don’t want to sound as though I condone SHS’s actions, and there is real suffering happening due to her actions and/or lack thereof. It’s immoral. It’s abusive. It’s wrong. I still think she gets served. (And that her order comes with a lecture on the side.)
Guys, I know we’re angry and feel powerless. But, is refusing to serve someone based on their job or political beliefs really where we want this to escalate? Remember the other side feels just as vehemently disgusted by us. (P.S. This is an honest question.)
@Ricardoshark18 I don’t think that’s me!
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan Splashy news items about individual crimes commited by undocumented people is an effective way to demonize and dehumanize them as a group. It’s a technique that’s been used historically by governments looking to scapegoat and oppress certain groups.
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan I read and investigated the artice! can’t corroborate his statements but I believe them. I’m sure there are kind people who work in border patrol. My issue is not with the border patrol. I would like my donation sent to https://t.co/3bLpxTOW6j. Thanks!!
@Actualscoobywan It’s so nice to be understood!  PS requesting asylum is not illegal. PPS crossing the border at a non-designated area is a misdemeanor. You know what else is? Cleaning a fish in a regular sink, not a “fish sink,” in a national park. The law does not equal morality.
It's official. @RandyRainbow is a national treasure. And #LegallyBlondetheMusical is criminally underrated. And, @jammyprod, WTF, amirite? #NSFW #HereBeProfanity https://t.co/oaC0NtnMWi
@ganghan9 Yes. I’m aware. The fight is not over.
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan I commented on this yesterday. I’m guessing you don’t actually want a comment.
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan I agree with him. Except in the case of legitimate asylum claims. Which I’m certain he agrees with. I don’t believe in keeping children in jails.
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan Heck yeah. That’s awful. I condemn.
I am relieved family separation is halted for now. However, imprisoning families together for longer periods of time is not a solution. We also need a plan for reuniting the thousands of families who've already been torn apart.
@aimeecarrero Nightmare!!!
Yes!!! Thank you to these courageous few. This is how change is made. Please, others, step up and join them! @WendyMolyneux @JuddApatow @SethMacFarlane @SteveLevitan @paulfeig https://t.co/4ZJUfGmrdX
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan This is false. All senate democrats support a bill that would end family separation immediately. Zero Republicans support it. Do not hold children hostage.
@Director3073 @MClaireEgan Yeah. Because this did not happen. This policy if separating families at the border is brand new.
@Director3073 Seeking asylum is not illegal. Seeking asylum is not illegal. Seeking asylum is not illegal. Seeking asylum is not illegal. Seeking asylum is not illegal.
Please give to https://t.co/3bLpxTOW6j and call your reps! But also consider sending much-needed supplies (https://t.co/DGPKzJkPrJ) and comfort items and notes to the children. Let’s let them know we have not forgotten them. Link below: https://t.co/6PeN0rr1iF

You know it's peak TV when you ask what's on and your husband says its a series called "detectorists." About guys who use metal detectors. And it's in its 3rd season. And then you find out he's not joking.
@mkraju @maggieNYT Unhelpful to their shared agenda. Unfortunate in terms of PR. Ryan's statement is unfortunate and unhelpful in that it totally misses the point.

@Julskihl @gregrikaart Just because they didn't sue doesn't mean they rescinded. If Weinstein's accusers doesn't press charges does that mean they rescind?

@AVerebely Obamacare was not passed through reconciliation: https://t.co/TnvXf6ggv5
@AVerebely Thank you. I loved the show and am very glad you enjoyed it. I miss it!
@AVerebely No that's not healthcare. That's if you choose not to buy healthcare.
@AVerebely Yes.
@AVerebely Obamacare was passed 60/40. Not by reconciliation.
@AVerebely That's not the health care of the ACA. Actual plans that cover essential health care for everyone, despite pre-existing conditions is.
@AVerebely If you choose not to be covered yes you pay a fine, which was ruled legal by the Supreme Court because it's officially a "tax."
@AVerebely No they don't have to. This is not the normal order. This is not because of reconciliation. This is a choice to push a bad bill through.
@AVerebely No one who cares about the healthcare of the people would vote for this. That's not obstruction that's protecting constituents.
@AVerebely No. It was passed 60/40. The right way. So you can only undo part of it 50/51. If they want a better plan they must reach across the aisle.
@AVerebely I agree. Anyone who votes for this bill is voting against the American people and should be voted out.
@AVerebely Which means you need to moderate your choices to get 60 votes. The nominees are not moderate and cannot appeal to both sides.
@AVerebely Those that do have under-qualified nominees. The 60/40 majority was set up by the framers to ensure bipartisan cooperation.
@AVerebely They've not reached across the aisle. As far as presidential confirmations, the vast majority of open roles have no nominees.
@AVerebely There is absolutely a choice. This is not the regular order. They are choosing this path and it's horrific. Write a better bill.
@AVerebely There is nothing about this bill that will make anyone's situation better. There are things that can be done. Not these things.
This is a vote in search of a bill. Nobody likes this plan. Nobody wants it. And it will kill the party. In addition to lots of Americans.

@BigTom40291 Wasn't aware this was happening! Great news for fans (like me!)
@FarRightGirl @crystalchappell The senate bill drastically phases out the ACA's Medicaid expansion, and cuts the budget beyond pre ACA levels.
@reneenilseb It was not in the original BCRA. McConnell is having to add it back to get votes.  I know it was in the ACA. It's the mandate.
@reneenilseb @gregrikaart The poverty rate on which they base premium tax credits will change. Two different issues.
@reneenilseb @gregrikaart Will lead to large scale shortfalls and reduction in enrollment.The poverty rate you refer to, rather, affects the individual market.
@reneenilseb @gregrikaart Yes, state run, largely federally funded. The matching funding for the expansion *will* be gutted.
@LRNichols @MillerLoLife I see what you did there.
My husband, @MillerLoLife, is going to be spending a lot of time with big ugly worms. And Kevin Bacon. https://t.co/AzaQtuiglA
Please listen to @voxdotcom The Weeds podcast for complete analysis of the Senate's health care bill. It's comprehensive and brilliant.
We will not allow a treatable illness or stray bullet or car accident or pregnancy to be a death sentence. This is not who we are.
We will not fund tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans on the lives of the poor and the sick. We will protect our most vulnerable.
Please, please call your senator. Especially he or she is a Republican. They need to know we won't be fooled. This bill stinks.
We will see a massive decline in people who have even catastrophic coverage, and no safety net. We cannot allow this bill to pass.
And with no requirement to buy in, (the ACA mandate), and terrible, unaffordable plans if you do, most lower-income Americans will opt out.
They'll say, anyone can buy our plan, we just don't cover cancer, births, MS, etc., etc. So, it's useless insurance.
But there's no requirement for minimum essential coverage. Giving insurance companies a back door for denying pre-existing conditions:
This bill prices people out of the insurance market. Why pay more for worse coverage? A plan you can't even afford to use when you need it?
On the insurance market, this bill will cause premiums to skyrocket and deductibles to soar. Didn't the GOP promise to lower both?
Still think the GOP is the pro-life party?
This isn't a rollback, it's the biggest cut in Medicaid history, and will be catastrophic for millions of Americans. Yes, people will die.
Medicaid covers 49% of births, 60% of nursing home residents, 39% of children and 35% of people with disabilities. The new bill guts it.
Thread. Life is precious. People will die. What's government for except to defend the weakest among us? https://t.co/R8hj0DVEI4
For the record, no, this is not normal. https://t.co/Ebb1jQCVtK

@kylegriffin1 World class trolling.
@lenoreriegel Hoooo boy. That was hard to watch. This level of confusion and difficulty putting coherent thoughts together is unsettling.
I sincerely thought everyone was referring to an unnamed Reality TV Show Winner.
@pixelatedboat @CChrisDobbins I think Bernie is full of shit and would have gotten fuckall done. Still would have voted for him had he been the nom.
@pixelatedboat @CChrisDobbins You're leaving out plenty of people really liked her. It's about it dealing with it like a grownup if you're not one of them.
The Paris accords have nothing to do with Paris, ya dopes. They were just signed there. (And happen to benefit Pittsburg more than Paris.) https://t.co/hrmUTCS5G2

Interesting perspective. I've got stars in my eyes for Macron. But he's being a little sh*t, I guess. https://t.co/guaTH2zcAD

@DaShanneStokes Thank you, sir!
I will add it isn't enough to abstain. Vote for the other guy. Because the crazies will still turn out and only you can stop them.

@missmollie_2000 That talking point is particularly wrongheaded and revealing. And the snowflake thing is tired and hackish. Try harder.
@umaangel00 @POTUS Lol, I know, right? 🤗
@missmollie_2000 I disagree with your assessment of BO however DT burned Israeli intel in favor of Russia. What a blessing if he were only cowardly and slow.
The time has come for Republicans to renounce DT and preserve their credibility and dignity and hahahahah lol jk they're toast.

@JayGenerico I'm not automatically everything he does, either. You'll notice I haven't commented on the Syria attack. I understand the move. (More)

@edenriegel The autism-vaccination fallacy is evidence of how entrenched misinformation can become.

@Ginger_Greta @Medium They are God's children. This is their journey. And perhaps it is our journey to learn to accept God's children.
@Ginger_Greta @Medium I don't agree with the premise. Of course God doesn't make mistakes. Presumptuous to assume you know what God means.
@Ginger_Greta @Medium Are you aware of people with XY chromosomes and female anatomy? How do you explain that?
@DRouwnt You didn't make any good points. To be fair it took you many tweets to make no points. So, A for effort? That's all I got for you.
@DRouwnt @fmacanadaguy It's not. Read the letter I posted. Educate yourself.
@DRouwnt @fmacanadaguy What are you talking about? I don't want segregated bathrooms. I want people to use the bathroom they want to use.
@DRouwnt @fmacanadaguy Trump rolled it back.
@DRouwnt @fmacanadaguy No extra protection. The law was passed to specifically target these kids. Obama signed an EO to stop the law.
@DRouwnt @fmacanadaguy No. But it's a very vulnerable place. And one where they could feel like just a kid and not an anomaly.
@DRouwnt @fmacanadaguy These stories have nothing to do with trans kids in school. Who themselves are victimized. Not the other way around.
@DianeOCameron me too.

@superalive1876 Dear soul. So quick to judge. So lacking in empathy and curiosity. BTW I don't get residuals on games. Your threat's wasted.
@Alana_DeLaGarza haha. Love this!
@lenoreriegel Way to go, mama!
@fmacanadaguy Well done, sir!
@SerialScholar Wow. That's so true.
Question: Do the post-empathy types who despise "snowflakes" still teach their children not to hurt others' feelings?
@TrumpRising22 Okay. Another time for all of it. Later!
@TrumpRising22 But I'm always happy to agree to disagree and keeps channels of communication open.
@TrumpRising22 I don't know what he supposedly has to do with protests. I don't think you do either beyond feeling "shady."
@TrumpRising22 I don't think attacks on Soros are unfair. I don't think their attacks and I think all billionaires are basically okay.
@TrumpRising22 well, actually that's not fair. You could get it directly from the president and still think this. Crazy.
@TrumpRising22 I literally don't know who Soros is. He's just an Internet punchline now. But I can tell where you get your news.
@TrumpRising22 Why do you think people are being paid? Who is paying them? How would that even work?
@TrumpRising22 We were all pretty sure he was going to be a disaster. The Central Park Five, birther movement and pussy grabbing was plenty.
@TrumpRising22 Why do you think any are paid? Surely you see online how angry people are.
@TrumpRising22 It's ludicrous and frankly beneath you.
@TrumpRising22 It's meant to be believed somebody is paying millions of people across the country? Largest conspiracy &amp; cover up in history?
@TrumpRising22 I personally know hundreds of people who protest. None were paid. Who would even be paying them? What a massive project.
@TrumpRising22 Two-state solution. No further expansion of settlements.
@shawn_larkin @TrumpRising22 If you're conflating pedophilia with transgenderism, you REALLY need to do some research on trans people.
@GeorgeMee @shawn_larkin @TrumpRising22 Couldn't agree more. I oppose laws that specifically apply 2 certain groups. Like the bathroom bill.
@shawn_larkin @TrumpRising22 These scenarios are ludicrous. Do some research about Trans people.
@TrumpRising22 @teasleyj No one is destroying their livelihood but themselves. By not complying with the law.
@TrumpRising22 @teasleyj You don't want to go back to Jim Crow days do you?
@TrumpRising22 @teasleyj By law you can't refuse services to someone based on their race, creed, color, gender etc.
@TrumpRising22 sure
@TrumpRising22 Nobody would choose that. It's just awful to go through. Kids want to fit in. It's not something you'd do for kicks
@TrumpRising22 What you're suggesting is possible but not likely. Have you ever felt like your body didn't belong? I haven't.
@TrumpRising22 So what's wrong with them using the bathroom where they feel more comfortable?
@TrumpRising22 Rats! We supported our child when they felt their body didn't fit. If we're not careful they might feel loved and accepted.
@TrumpRising22 I really don't see your point. How does supporting your child harm anyone? Including the child.
@DRouwnt @samriegel That's completely false. I've hated it since the beginning. Because I'm a fucking human being. Maybe you should try it.
@DRouwnt @samriegel I thought you said you didn't care where people took a shit. Yawn. Turns out you're just a plain old intolerant bore.
@Brian_Holden Despicable.
@DRouwnt @samriegel It's great words can't hurt you. Ur an adult. These r kids wanting 2 piss without being harassed. Have some compassion.
@DRouwnt @samriegel I'm heartened you've never felt the anguish of being born the wrong gender, and then facing relentless fear and hate.
Sickened over the lifting of basic human protections for our most vulnerable. Trans people have a right to dignity and identity. https://t.co/hHQldWq1rN

@jilldotter Talk about fake news. They are real constituents. Enough of this.
@jilldotter Okay I'll delete the tweet because I'd rather be sure. I'm skeptical, however.
@jilldotter And what does that have to do with Obamacare, which was the topic?
@jilldotter If this were true he's still saying in Republican districts dissenting opinion shouldn't have a voice?
@jilldotter Your explanation makes no sense. Town Halls are not rallies. Republican congress people do not solely represent Republicans.
@BillionaireDrax Literally. That's a great analogy.
Also, leaks can't be illegal if false, as POTUS now claiming. But wouldn't have fired Flynn if false. Caught in a Catch 22 of lies.
Leaks only illegal if they compromise our national security. In this case they defend it. Likely protected by whistleblower act.

@Ginger_Greta No. But I would literally die to protect your right to free exercise of your religion. Also I'm a Jew. That feels relevant.
@Ginger_Greta Um, no I don't believe in God. I do stand for a strong Israel, and I believe a two state solution is the path to peace.
@Ginger_Greta I do stand for Israel. But I do not support expanding settlements.
@Ginger_Greta Well, I don't support new settlements so that's not asset to me. The Iran $ and easing on nuclear power is debatable.
@TrumpRising22 Uhu. So why did Trump remove him?
@Ginger_Greta @platnum56 What wrongs is he fixing?
@tinkerbelle3257 But he's a Washington outsider! He'll run it like a business! Blah, blah, blah…
@mjmatias1977 Yeesh.
You know what's crazy? Donald Trump is actually worse at his job than I thought he'd be. Much, much worse.
@QuaziSaiman Thank you!!!!
When people within an administration don't take important information seriously, it gets leaked. That's called whistle blowing.
@AbsoluteEden Probably still Mike Flynn.
Thrilled that there is still even the tiniest bit of accountability in the WH. Founding fathers and the Fourth Estate saving our asses.
@thehill Ugh.
@BlueLightsShine 👍👍👍
@904blaze @Chrishell7 Thank you. Well said.
@Chrishell7 Stay strong my friend.
@Chrishell7 Just reported him. The tweet where he threatened you came up as an option to check when choosing which tweets to report.
@Chrishell7 Right? I was dying. Needed that!
The fake Lincoln quote the @GOP used today exemplifies their sweeping assault on truth. But the replies are comedy gold; nearly worth it. https://t.co/CQNSAywH4M
For the record. See below. As this administration finds it harder to govern they will get increasingly annihilative &amp; destroy the republic. https://t.co/7zEzCvpFJ0

@TrumpRising22 you should pitch it if we get another run!!
@TrumpRising22 that sounds great and very topical!
@TrumpRising22 He was spectacular. Such a loss.
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU Thanks. That's sweet.
@TrumpRising22 I would love for the show to get another life. I missed your pitches. What were they?!
@TrumpRising22 I doubt it would happen but it would be great. It's all susan's idea. Who knows?
@Ginger_Greta @TrumpRising22 @ACLU Lady, if you're gonna pearl-clutch over the word "shit" you should definitely block me.
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU How bout you guys do the same?
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say all this stuff if hard and shit goes wrong.
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta You implied a leak. Like an intentional leak. That's different from being compromised.
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta Yes the mission was compromised. It was not successful. But if I've been hasty I apologize.
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU Wow. Is that what fox is saying? If being lied to brings you comfort I guess I understand.
@Ginger_Greta @TrumpRising22 @ACLU Um, Yemen raid? Literally your dude's call.
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU I've lost the thread. Have a good Saturday!
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU again, no clue why you're talking about Hillary. Literally no one is less relevant.
@Ginger_Greta @TrumpRising22 @ACLU What has he done?
@TrumpRising22 @Ginger_Greta @ACLU Who said anything about Hilllary Clinton? Election's over, dudes. Time to move on.
@Ginger_Greta @TrumpRising22 @ACLU I'm happy for you. Most of us feel threatened. Curious what you think he's doing well? Thx.
@Ginger_Greta Glad you read it. This isn't about the election which is certainly over.
@Ginger_Greta Article. Read the article.
This, guys. We're already less free. I'm living it. Are you? https://t.co/oRkuu5UQW7
@MillerLoLife That's the one. Delivery was perfect, too. You would have been proud.
@TrumpRising22 BTW, That's a low bar. You would hope he'd prosecute murderers. And not the whole story either: https://t.co/vrnvzKIVcZ https://t.co/iv50o3LoA1
@luvthmgators @TrumpRising22 @ACLU Reagan didn't discuss lifting sanctions with our enemies before being inaugurated.
@luvthmgators @TrumpRising22 @ACLU Huh? We both know nothing. What are you referring to?
@luvthmgators @TrumpRising22 @ACLU You know what is possibly treasonous? Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador.
@luvthmgators @TrumpRising22 @ACLU Dissent is not treason. This nation was founded to protect healthy dissent. Govt of the ppl, etc.
@TrumpRising22 @luvthmgators @ACLU I was saying the democrats lose everything. It was a joke.
@TrumpRising22 @luvthmgators @ACLU agreed. It is too bad.
@TrumpRising22 @luvthmgators @ACLU Nice doesn't equal good. He's not good for the country. Everything else is beside the point.
@TrumpRising22 And baselessly prosecuted those who did voter outreach in minority areas. That's a bad record.
@TrumpRising22 Not sure. It's immaterial what's in his heart. I know as prosecutor he turned a blind eye to race-based voter suppression.
@luvthmgators @TrumpRising22 @ACLU wait, I'm sorry, do you think we shouldn't fight radical terror cells in the Middle East?
@TrumpRising22 @ACLU The whole point of this is to resist getting tired. I think he's dangerous and humiliation seems most effective.
@AustinHighsmith Thank you. I'm very proud.
5-yr-old: I didn't do it! I swear! Me: I believe you. But it is a mystery, right? (Long pause) 5-yr-old: Trump. That's the only solution.
He still doesn't know what a court is, or how to use punctuation, but his letter recognition is above grade level. They grow up so fast!
You know what's adorable? POTUS heard @ACLU say "See you in court," and now he's trying it out in a sentence like a big boy. #Whosabigboy?
@2020fight You already wanna erase the Ed department, eh Bets? Buy your own damn pencils. You already bought your seat.
@MugDealers @LowEnergySJW @andarian1 @SenateMajLdr @POTUS That's just fucking perfect.
@LowEnergySJW @andarian1 @SenateMajLdr @POTUS That's right. McConnell is a silly goose. In that cute worst-person-in-the-world kinda way.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS This is why you don't practice unprecedented obstructionism when the other party has the presidency, silly!
@Ginger_Greta I'm damn sore my country is being destroyed before my eyes. And you, ma'am, are neither classy nor sassy. Good day.
@Ginger_Greta Hypocrisy is alive and well in America. I really don't care where he goes. Other people are doing all the work anyway.
@Ginger_Greta Weird. Don't know who that is, but you seem to think it's your business what he did and not mine what DT does.
@Ginger_Greta  For one thing I pay for it.
Y'all, it's totally cool that POTUS spends every weekend at Mar-a-Lago. You can yell at the TV in your bathrobe anywhere. #PresidentBannon
@shannontinberg I loved every minute of working on this show. Great people, beautiful story telling, heartwarming and, best of all, funny!

@BankoftheWest Reaching out to you here because I'm at my wit's end with your company, and nearly tweeted widely tonight. Very dissatisfied.
@mmadwin @thehill First, not true. 2nd, yeah I'm sure that's Kamala's fault she's been in office 2 months. 3rd, defunding ain't gonna help.
@MSLisaChang white men will be the death of us all. I'm so sorry. That's awful.
@MSLisaChang wait, is that your car?!
@thehill Proud of my senator.
@AustinHighsmith She just really, REALLY cares about defunding public education and ensuring kids don't have a future.
@MSLisaChang found you! Oy, the whole thing makes me very uncomfortable. Much more myself on Twitter.

@TracyJ516 @washingtonpost Me too! The Washington Post has been doing exceptional reporting and I'm proud the be a subscriber.
A friendly reminder that, 14 days in, there is still no evidence POTUS has legally distanced himself from his business holdings.
By refusing Merrick Garland a hearing, the GOP has stolen this seat. No Gorsuch is "not that bad." But we must oppose him anyway. https://t.co/Ly1bZ7adYg
@galleriegirl I was so disturbed! I have no poker face.
@AbsoluteEden No, I know it's just a ratings ploy. I would never!
@PrattFalls Love this!
@kashanacauley I'm struggling to understand why "snowflake" is an insult. Like who could get insulted by something so stupid and immature?
@JaeCreitch I think u realize ur falsely conflating for effect. Ever hear of Benghazi? But don't fret, those were already well investigated.
@Rdshore315 that's what I was thinking!

@RENgence I love this comment.
@RENgence Anyway, I'm very glad you lien Kiara and I hope I didn't destroy that with my stupid opinions. I can never keep my mouth shut.
@RENgence ACLU donation pronto. I'm all for strikes for better wages but stranding people needing to get to airport seems misguided.
@RENgence it seems like it happened fast so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now. But it would help if they matched the
@RENgence Okay it's complicated.For me they didn't profit as they turned off surge pricing. And they tweeted it was not meant 2 break strike
@RENgence Where is the proof they did it to break the strike? How is the strike okay? The airlines, airports, travelers didn't ask 4 the EO.
@RENgence Actively colluding with fascists is quite a accusation. How again are they doing that? By allowing people to get to their flights?
@RENgence That doesn't seem like breaking the strike. And I don't agree with a strike to begin with personally.
@Brian_Holden I just got uncomfortable with movements like this because they feel Trumpian to me.
@Brian_Holden They specifically didn't employ surge pricing. And he's on an advisory committee saying he will challenge DT.
@Razorb Can you send me a link to that?
@Collegebound973 And uber has pledged support for drivers affected by the EO. Is there something else? This isn't enough for me.
@Collegebound973 I mean, I don't know that I was on board with taxis refusing service 2 people needing to travel. They didn't ask 4 the EO.
@Collegebound973 Not quite. They just continued service.
@edenriegel Trying to inform myself and I can't find anything beyond that. Educate me!
Guys, not to be a buzzkill, but are we really boycotting uber because they allowed passengers to go to JFK yesterday? Including protesters?

@Ifynwigwe It happened. Why is he okay with Russian tampering? They are our biggest global threat. He's loves them.
@Ifynwigwe The lack of curiosity is astounding. He should take it seriously. Not prematurely dismiss it be use it looks bad for him.
@Ifynwigwe our president elect isn't getting his intelligence briefings and has rejected the CIA's findings out of hand.
@Ifynwigwe The CIA has proof. They are "confident" in their findings. That CIA for very strong evidence.

@tojo9973 @realDonaldTrump Who's spreading hate? I'm concerned our democracy is being threatened. I don't understand why our PEOTUS is not.

@TrumpRising22 No. I'm not laughing. It's not a joke. Anything short of outrage is inadequate.

Full disclosure: I knew Donald Trump. He was nothing but nice to me and my family. He's still a threat to my country.

@tctagc No one is breaking any laws.  These rights are guaranteed by the constitution.
@tctagc I love my flag. I fly it proudly. I would never desecrate it. But I value more highly than that the right of anyone to do so.
@tctagc But do not turn my country into one.
@tctagc You don't like the people who burn flags. You don't like what they stand for. That's dissent. Don't like it, find a Dictatorship.
@tctagc Burning the flag is exercising that very freedom. We're not talking about "other things." We're talking about flag burning.
@tctagc That's not what we're talking about.
@tctagc Um... Yes it does.
@tctagc The ppl who died for this country fought to preserve what it stands for. Don't throw that away to protect a symbol.
@tctagc Who said anything about BLM?
@tctagc But moreover I wonder what the flag means of not as a symbol of the freedoms we hold dear. Just a "sacred" piece of cloth?
@tctagc BTW the flag is absolutely not off limits, according to the Supreme Court. Twice.
@tctagc That's destroying public property and endangering lives. Crimes. Totally different. Burning a flag hurts no one.
@tctagc Of course you can. That's hardly the point.
@tctagc The founders didn't HAVE a flag. I guarantee you they cared a whole lot more about free expression. It's the 1st bloody amendment.
@tctagc Nope. Freedom of expression. Freedom of dissent is what separates our democracy from dictatorship.
Question: if Pres HRC named a fmr Goldman exec &amp; a billionaire investor to Treasury &amp; Commerce, you'd be pissed, no? Why not so w/ PEOTUS?
In our house when I let out a deep sigh @MillerLoLife asks, "WoMa?" It's always, "Yeah." #WoMa #WorldMalaise
I can't believe Romney kissed the ring. Is there no decency left?
Only YOU can defend our democracy: https://t.co/xKNjXRjLd1
@castillano420 I see our education system has failed its citizens. We're better than this.
@mikeohio2323 @TrumpRising22 @realDonaldTrump I'm a citizen. This is my country. My freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution.
@SIYankeefan &amp; what he was fighting against is the Despotism our PEOTUS displays by threatening to revoke citizenship b/c of free expression
@SIYankeefan With respect your father fought for our Democratic ideals. Without those the flag is symbol of nothing.
@SIYankeefan What on earth does the flag stand for but the freedoms that define our country and that we hold dear? No freedoms, no flag.
@pcaro75 You said it, sister.
@lenoreriegel @WSJ Insane.
@Ifynwigwe If setting a good example for democracy is important we mustn't allow anyone to erode our constitution. Even an elected dictator.
@Ifynwigwe Thank God it still does. I accept the results but what I will not accept is anyone attacking my inalienable rights.
@Ifynwigwe @realDonaldTrump Precisely! So glad you're getting it.
@TracyJ516 Honestly I'd rather know.
@Dbljack1 Very different but I appreciate your civility! Best to you.
@GeorgeTakei This is incredibly powerful. Thank you for your patriotism and for standing up to those who would destroy our freedoms.
@Dbljack1 It's stands for, among other things, the constitutional right to free expression. If I don't have that the flag is meaningless.
@anniesue10 The right to burn the flag is as much a symbol of what our country stands for as the flag itself.
@anniesue10 That's not what he's saying. He's saying jail and loss of citizenship.
@Dbljack1 Are you aware of the first amendment?
Loss of citizenship? What country are we living in? This man is a clear and present danger to the country I love. https://t.co/MFdAsbM4SZ
@Heather_D_  Thank you for your reply. And your service.
Electors, please consider why your role is protected in our constitution. You are the only thing standing between our republic and tyranny. https://t.co/MFdAsbM4SZ
Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. That is now without question. All the evidence needed is in this tweet. https://t.co/MFdAsbM4SZ
Guys, our President doesn't understand what freedom of expression is. No matter your political opinions you should find this catastrophic. https://t.co/MFdAsbM4SZ
I can't wait! I love my @Theehendrickson and I love BAM! https://t.co/faccBRVTDC
@WendyMolyneux I love you.
I mourn the death of decency, responsibility, and inclusivity in Trump's America. But more than anything I mourn the death of truth. https://t.co/juORdMh5P5
@mceidson He's the one who said there's "serious voter fraud." His words. Solution? Nationwide forensic audit and criminal investigation?
@poniewozik @danpfeiffer Despicable. The Fourth Estate is failing us.
'Memba when he promised to accept the results of the election... if he won? Looks like even that was a lie. https://t.co/YjZaeeER7I
It's officially okay to play christmas music. Might I suggest something new featuring someone not so new? https://t.co/dx47yCijMf

@IzazaOzihaha @SilverTalkie Hilarious! Hiyah!!!
@gregrikaart @Slyfox20109863 I went to college. I know what's up. Happy thanksgiving, handsomes!
@gregrikaart @Slyfox20109863 Fixed it further: You're so sane. Def still your fan. Share your opinions with me! Later, bitch!
Nixon: "Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal." Trump: "The president can't have a conflict of interest."
I have a bookmarks tab called "fun" for sites like facebook, twitter, Huffpo. Just renamed it "fuuuuuuuuuck."
@BlueLightsShine True. And terrifying.
Historic popular vote victory. (And spare me the 3 million "fake and illegal" votes baloney. I am NOT post-truth.) https://t.co/1EitQLhq8V
@davidplouffe Is there any hope of a recount in PA , MI and WI? Or should I stop dreaming?
@JudyAScott Yes! Thank you! I feel like I've entered some alternate reality in which there's no truth.
Watch the Hamilton cast message for Pence. Respectful, impassioned message I hoped against hope would get thru. Don't let them lie to you.
I screamed for two hours and didn't even get double scale. Because I support my Union! #PerformanceMatters #insomniacgamesnegociate https://t.co/fQa1w8G1ZP
I support my Union fighting for a fair contract. #performancematters
I just donated to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Now, more than ever, CRR and others need $ to fight for us. https://t.co/B1Yiy8mnNl
Thank you, veterans, for your service and sacrifice. I am filled with gratitude to you and the democratic values you fought for today.
The silenced majority. Now if only a bunch of us moved to Florida. Any volunteers? https://t.co/TownnwLtwW
@christwele But part of what you guys own now is every branch of government. No obstructionism. No checks and balances. No one to blame.
@christwele So proud. Dignity and respect in the White House. Such a beautiful time for our country.
And yes I'm aware that sounds crackpot. I've reached the "raving lunatic" stage of grief.
Infinite universes means there's one out there with all of us in it that elected President Hillary Clinton last night. Lucky bastards.
Alright, Republicans. You broke it, you own it. Let's see what you do with no one to blame.
@IceWaterMage give us time...
Ugly tears in the car listening to my girl.
Ah so the endless election goes on another day. Perfect.
@dznymagic I'm sure we disagree on a lot but not on love for this country. I'm troubled. Best of luck to you.
@dznymagic Believe me I'm going to try to make the best of it for my kids. And for our country. I'm just deeply unsettled.
@dznymagic No you are! Great. Now we're children. Give it a rest.
@leeawalla Hey congrats! You're officially a troll. Blocked! Oh beautiful America where I have freedom. At least for now.
@dznymagic What the hell, lady? Back off.
How do I tell my children in the morning? Hate, bigotry, anger, fear, cynicism won. They will be less safe tomorrow. I will have less hope. https://t.co/mr8Tdktnk4
This is humiliating. Tomorrow we wake up a global laughing stock. And we deserve it.
Guys, what the actual fuck is happening?
#IVOTED #WeVoted If these cutie-pies can wait in line so can you! Please go vote! We're all counting on you. https://t.co/9Mu3BUAQtJ
My fierce 106-year-old Grandma, born before the 19th amendment, will vote for a woman for President tomorrow. #ImWithHer #&amp;her #&amp;her&amp;her&amp;her
I've spent most of the past year enraged, despondent &amp; incredulous. Now I'm just freaking pumped. Never been more excited to pull the lever!
I get to vote for a lady for president tomorrow!
@MBsandsKU C'mon! That was nothing!
@BlueSparrow25 Why thank you!!
I'm on NCIS: Los Angeles tonight! Tune in live on @CBS!
@cadlymack Ha! I hope I hope! You have the same bday as my son. You're both cool.
I still have trouble imagining someone going in a voting booth and actually voting for Donald Trump for President. Is this real?
@WendyMolyneux Why do I love it so much when you tweet at yourself?
I invite anyone in a right wing media echo-chamber to please read this with an open mind. Just give it a chance. https://t.co/siL46lYLAe
@IamLaceyChabert Look at those beautiful feet!
I'm on location but in spirit I stand with my fellow interactive artists currently rallying for a fair deal. #performancematters
@remjr54 I'm dope? Yes I am! Thanks!
@MBsandsKU I thought his head would spin being torn bet authoritarian govt and heroes of industry. And so he'd just think everyone sucked.
@MBsandsKU Atlas shrugged. Woman runs a company? Gimme a break! Also buys American steel. Loser. Way cheaper from China. #TrumpBookReport
And not for nothing, Hillary had ALL the questions ahead of time. And many more. She guessed them. That's called debate prep.
Little tip: "winners" don't complain their opponent got the questions ahead of time. #losersdo
I'm in awe of Hillary Clinton, and her staggering level of strength and discipline. I couldn't have survived 90 seconds of that fetid ooze.
@HarMonica626 Love this. Thank you!!!
@Yitsul This is the best compliment!

This is life, the one you get. And I'll take it! Fun job this week, is what I'm saying. https://t.co/VmBg9lKy5c
@BryanUF Ha! Good one.
DO NOT infringe upon my inalienable right of reince priebus. That is, the right to put party over all sense of decency.
I will say I truly can't wait to meet Trump's Super Senior Campaign Maharishi, Campaign Emperor, and, of course, Campaign God.
For a guy whose catch phrase is "You're fired," he sure has trouble  firing people. It's so cute in that pathetic, needy, daddy-issues way.
@JessalynGilsig @MillerLoLife Weird, though, that he's been saying it since Lillehammer. Right?
My son calls it the "National Hanthem." Please no one ever tell him it's not.
Donald Trump. Stochastic Terrorist. Maybe we'd be better served banning orange people. https://t.co/6NjumOlZMn
@HarMonica626  Ha! I LOVE it!
@WendyMolyneux Ha!!
@Eaglesfan1963 I just thought it was a great burn.
@Eaglesfan1963 it was a quote from her speech. About trump's RNC acceptance. But I forgot the quotation marks!

For the record, my kid loves "Chugga Chugga Choo Choo," too. So I guess I'm basically political royalty. #DemsInPhilly
So proud to be an American and so proud of my First Lady. Thank you, Michelle. #DNCinPHL
@petrinajc He's appealing to the worst and darkest parts of us.
@2p2politics Wow. Just wow.
@ReginaMonsoon hilarious!
@AlishaTrantham So so messed up.
Um, pretty sure "I'm with her" isn't a loyalty pledge required by Secretary Clinton. It's like, you know, a cute slogan. #RNCinCLE
I love this message of hope and defeating cynics after 4 days of non-stop DEATH! FEAR! HATE!!! THEY'RE COMING FOR US! AHHHHHHH!
I learned at six that repeating "believe me" over and over doesn't actually make you more believable. #RNCinCLE
"We can't let all those dirty foreigners oppress our LGBT community! That's OUR job!" -Trump #RNCinCLE
I think it's really low that FLOTUS went back in time &amp; plagiarized Melania's speech retroactively. Haven't white people been thru enough??
@Gina_PhyllisFan i love it!!!
I mean, it's pretty clear there's a problem when even Newt Gingrich knows there's a problem. Right?? #BlackLivesMatter

Any leader who has opposed or dragged their heels on gun reform is complicit in these deaths. As are those who encourage and legislate hate.
Enough is enough. We must demand meaningful action on gun legislation from our representatives. Please, no more.
@ernieLA thank you very much. You're so sweet!
Does anybody else feel a little bit of sanity has been restored to the world today?

@DarenceLC Signal when you first pull out, and at every turn. Check your blindspot. Wear your seatbelt. Practice parallel parking a lot.

@MBsandsKU &lt;3 U.
@Jaina47 Seems like instead of constantly having to clarify perhaps the name could better represent the services they provide.
@Jaina47 Never thought of it that way. But I do feel that the name is now incorrect. They don't only do birth control and abortions.
@MBsandsKU I mean, it implies all they do is birth control and abortions. And that's not the case.
@MBsandsKU well that's interesting. But if that's the case PP doesn't really encapsulate what they do anyway.
Real question: Why can't Planned Parenthood change their name to "Women's Heath." Wouldn't it be harder to call for defunding it then?
@mariari00 Happy Birthday to you!
@samriegel this is for the interactive strike authorization? How about the sound recordings contract?

@lenoreriegel I must love you a lot!
@NICKWALSH @MSLisaChang oh Amazeballs! Could you perchance DM me your contact info and lemme know what time would work for you?
Does #Backstrom wear a fitbit? Does his app just read "Fat Fuck" every time he syncs?
Tweeps. I need your help. Any of my followers an expert in the field of Internet media? And willing to be interviewed by me tomorrow?
I think the Apple drop tests are from 2 cm. And it still fails.
I like Jimmy. Can we have a Jimmy spinoff? #Backstrom
"This looks like Chinese to me. Like literally this is written in Chinese."That joke is better than those on any Chuck Lorre show this week.
I came for #Backstrom's gut. Stayed for Niedermeyer's soft shoe, Paquet's accent, and Valentine's bedroom eyes.
@iamkellyoverton If it makes you feel better I never even got to see the white and gold!
@BackstromWritrz @MillerLoLife @beefgaysha Always. You better give that lady a foot rub or something for us.
No such thing as astrological signs, etc. Says the man struck by inspiration during a prayer circle last episode. #Backstrom I call BS!
@MBsandsKU Cosign.
Very smart making a laundry a money laundering dummy business. It's like, the cops will never know!!
@MillerLoLife I thought that was an intruder. I was told you just stay still and pretend you don't see them. Like a bear.
I'm waaay on board with Paquet's malapropisms. #BackstromWritrz, @millerlolife, you listening?
Backstrom likes any case involving shoveling noodles down his throat while "chasing leads."
White or Gold, Blue or Black, Backstrom hates that dress no matter what. Watch #Backstrom now, west coast!!!
@MBsandsKU @MillerLoLife meh...
How 'bout we shower @MillerLoLife with some birthday love? He deserves it. He puts up with me and these two jokers. http://t.co/I9TiDbPfU6
So everybody is happy! What a great season finale! ...oh. #Backstrom
All this talk of rape torture and murder makes this ep way less sexy. #Backstrom

@jodiegojo @keerwashere Wow. Not gonna lie that made me teary. And it's fucking hilarious, too. You're better, I'm assuming, correct?
@keerwashere @brujobitch AND congrats on making it to the other side of "it gets better." Looks like it for great for you. Xo
@keerwashere @brujobitch PS Holy courageous, batman. And you're cute. And I'm so sorry I never replied to your letter.
I kinda feel like my life was all worth it thanks to @keerwashere. It was a pleasure being your #TeenageDream https://t.co/2lX3GI20D3
@brujobitch This is Uh-Maze! Retweeting pronto. Can I tag Kerstyne? Does she have twitter?

My good God I do love Rainn Wilson. So glad he's back on my tv. #Backstrom
@THEREALKELVIN_8 Thank you!!!! :)
Wow, Almond has to moonlight as a pastor AND do commercials. Portland PD must pay terribly. #livingwageforAlmond #Backstrom
Women with bangs are *always* hiding something. Usually forehead wrinkles. #backstrom
The way #Backstrom keeps bringing up the dead guy's member makes me think he might be packing light, himself.
I don't really understand a word Paquet says, but that may just be because her stunning giant eyes are distracting me.
Backstrom: You ever kissed a woman? Gravely: It's called college. -- ZING! I love this show. #Backstrom

It is pretty stinking cute that my son calls them uppercase and rollercase letters. #softensmystoneheart
Ah the Toy Story franchise. Inspiring a generation of hoarders.
I really hate when I order Chinese or sushi and they give me too many chopsticks. Feels very judgey.
Way to catch another murderer, #Backstrom. I will tune in next week to see if you can do it again.
OMG SO TRUE! RT @MillerLoLife My wife insists I only work on shows where she can not-so-quietly swoon over @theThomasDekker. #Backstrom
@BackstromWritrz @MillerLoLife Not complicated. My guess is he was fucking with you. #NiedenValor #FoEvah!
@KrisPolaha @AngeliqueCabral That is AMAZING.

.@BackstromFOX starts at 9, East Coast! If you're not watching live... Well then even my mother is more with-it than you. #BackstromPremiere
@DreamyPopLover Thank you! I'm sure glad I read this one!
Need another reason to watch @BackstromFOX tomorrow at 8/9C? 1/8th of the writers is definitely a good lay. And the rest likely are.
.@BackstromFOX premiers TOMORROW at 9/8C on FOX. Trust me, nothing else good is on. Don't bother checking your listings.
Best thing about @MillerLoLife's job is him coming home all sweet and kitten-y after he's used up all his snark on @BackstromFOX dialogue.
Set your DVRs now (and then, like, watch it live, duh!) @BackstromFOX premiers this Thursday 9/8C.
5 minutes on Hollywood Blvd in broad daylight I was asked for a cigarette, a pad, an autograph, and watched a lady take a piss.
@NakedWeaver @amynix6 @screwthechew @CBRVA I really thought that was genius. Honorable mention!
@AbsoluteEden @amynix6 @screwthechew @CBRVA That's a baller name. His nom de plume.
The winner is (drumroll, please).... Rory!! Thank you for the suggestion, @amynix6, @screwthechew and @CBRVA. Great minds think alike!
@leah_bh I did not!  Cool!
@AmandaTudesco That is so funny! I love your lion. Any man repelled by Louie deserves to be kicked to the curb.
You guys are geniuses. I love these names! Keep 'em coming. I should have had you name my children, as well.

@JeremyBronson Congrats papa Bronson!
Somehow @serial has me feeling like a cynic one minute, and a chump the next. Swinging between the two is a stomach-turning ride.
@TheLACosplayCon I just followed you. You may DM me and I can provide you with something there.
@Eliza8R amazing. Love that pic.

@japmap2009 That's the problem. The emails are never coming through. On the app I can tell they have the correct email.
@MBsandsKU @instagram I'm sincerely hoping I can tweet shame them into responding to my requests for help.
@MBsandsKU @instagram So far instagram has been EXTRAORDINARILY unhelpful in helping me logon to my account as I have lost the password.
@Sean_M_Maher @CasperVanDien Best day evahhhh! You two are the tops.

Fun fact, Jennifer Love Hewitt has a baby daughter almost the same age as Henry! So I'm guessing both of us were pumping in our trailers.
@MBsandsKU Jeez, MOM.
Flight 420, duuuuudes! I have a theory as to why it went down. Pilots were high in a couple of different senses of the word. #CriminalMinds

Looking for perfection in a stroller is like looking for perfection in a mate. I already struck gold once, though. ;) @MillerLoLife

@MSLisaChang @MillerLoLife Why did you have to show me that?! (Also, what took you so long?)
I just crept past the rooms of my two sleeping kids and realized I'm not really sure if this is real life.
I started the day well-rested and ended it drunk. Now THAT'S a good Mother's Day.
Thank you to my amazing mom, @lenoreriegel, without whom me celebrating Mother's Day today would be awkward to say the least.

@IamLaceyChabert Congratulations my dear friend. I am so happy for you. Double date soon with our Misters!
@ingridkavelaars Thank you, Ingrid! We miss you guys. Happy new year to Dallas and the girls!
I pumped, left grandma with a bottle, a baby, a pup, and a monitor. Time to get my drink on with my best guy. Happy birthday to me!
Thank you for all the birthday love. It's enough to last till 2015. (As if my 3 boys didn't already give me more than my share.)
Amazing birthday eve. Two snoozing kids, real raw sushi, a kir royale and a screener. #luckygirl #Hello2014!
Happy birthday to @AbsoluteEden's @SillyPhylly, without whom I'd only be #SortaEden.
Takeaway favors from our "Meet Henry" party. I say it all the time! http://t.co/GB9pIhpYlS
First solo outing as a mom of 2! (To get froyo.) AND I'm not in maternity pants.
One week old. To the minute!!! Happy birthday, Henry. (PS That milk is going STRAIGHT to his cheeks) http://t.co/QtbWkhENuD
Total number of prenatal yoga classes first pregnancy: 2. Total this time: 0. So there. I've gotten less Hollywood.
Just tweeting while my newborn sleeps on me. How awesome is that?!
And I'm sure some of you ladies will recognize Cedars amazing tropical fruit punch. Heaven! http://t.co/Utn5gF2il2
Post delivery snack. Best food I've EVER had! http://t.co/kMqBZBi6Ew

Thank you, @MSLisaChang! #servingsuggestion http://t.co/2n2dYXTvru
Last night I was too excited to sleep. Today I'm too sleepy to be excited. Irony or just life?
@PrattFalls Oh yeah? Well wait till they see the friends we recently got for Thor. http://t.co/c9Tg9DJG3R
I love the earth as much as the next guy, but can we please make LED Christmas lights less depressing? Thanks, E.

Moving day is never any fun but it's LESS fun when you already packed your tums. #burning!
Friends, there are 14 shopping days till Christmas. And 14 days till the arrival of the littlest Miller! Feel free to take this as a hint.
Thank you guys so much. Every detail was perfection. I had so much fun I didn't take a single picture to prove it!
Surprise baby shower sprinkle hosted by the incredible @Alana_DeLaGarza totally blew me away. @iamkellyoverton @Laura_AllenLA  @Chandra_West
I know he ran from it for the rest of his career, but man was Christopher Plummer genius in this role.
@Nettey128 OMG I thought the same thing. Totally pine valley forest!
I will say chick can yodel.
I miss Julie Andrews.
I slept in till 10 this morning for maybe the last time in my life! At least until my boys are sullen teenagers who do nothing but sleep.
@Laura_AllenLA yeah! Kick ass girl!
You internet people move way too fast for me. #whoisbatkid?
@samriegel We're keeping it real with the die hard NPR nerds. Not you bourgeois wannabes.
It my favorite date night of the year again: Radiolab Live in LA! #apocalyptical #themillersarenerds

Here are some of my favorite moments from my AMC history, in no particular order! @joshduhamel http://t.co/8D051lAzjN
Very sad I can't return to my AMC family again and play the role I love so much. I'll spend the day mourning and remembering the good times.
Damnit. What a colossal shame! The show we all loved, that had such success online, dead again. http://t.co/A6AQzEu3C6
Poor man's @MSLisaChang. http://t.co/bObjjEhF8D
@MSLisaChang I meant live but, let's face it, either works.
@MSLisaChang Can I come love with you?
@Chrishell7 Thanks to you (and pregnancy hormones) I went in search of cronuts today and came up empty! My usual dealer lost his supplier!
@lenoreriegel Don't lose hope! Absentee ballots have yet to be counted. It's no guarantee, but there's still a slim chance!
Just a day of errands humming @SincerelyDenyse's "Better Than Nothing." Better than anything!
@Chrishell7 They're already here! Honestly I think we got them first. New Yorkers just trying to be like us.
Jack took to Trick-or-Treating like a kid getting free candy from strangers for the first time. http://t.co/GkrF6eRskG
Happy Halloween, everybody! #TrickorRetweet! (Ha, ha!)
I know less than my dog about sports but that sure didn't look like obstruction to me. My dog is licking his balls so he can't weigh in.
Remember when we actually had to lick stamps? I mean, how were we not just exhausted all the time?
@MillerLoLife Baby you are so brave.
I had lunch so, yeah, now there's no room to breathe.
A watched eBay auction never gets bids.
A taste of my childhood. #cravings #akaAnExcuseToEatWeirdShit http://t.co/LydHPkWYdV
For all you Canadians, don't forget to watch my pal @Chandra_West on #PlayedCTV tonight! Brand new episode. Prepare to get #Played.
@MillerLoLife Cheaper than a Babymoon but no substitute for a push gift, if you catch my drift.
And once again toothpaste ruins a perfectly good outfit.
I survived Carmageddon and DVRmageddon. Pretty sure that means God and I are BFFs.
Last night I had a swig of pickle juice and a bite of apple before bed. And I did not wake up with heartburn at 1am. Thank you all.
Apples, cider vinegar, milk, ginger tea, soda, pickle juice, bananas, aloe vera. May not cure my heartburn but sure sounds like a party!
Anybody have any natural remedies for heartburn that really work? These tums are for the birds.
I've been saying for years why doesn't somebody make skin care for pregnancy? So we don't have to constantly read 1000 ingredients.
Got an amazing "bump" gift from @celebritygifts including this genius line of products. Thank you! http://t.co/5IBVqS6uCA
After shopping almost exclusively at Trader Joe's if I go into a "real" supermarket I feel vaguely like I've been living in Eastern Europe.
Very cool, @MillerLoLife. After stealing my heart you're an expert on thievery. http://t.co/B67162N4kM
@Cormac_Neville I've scoured the internet. Not available ANYWHERE!
Just found out Jack's "can't live without it" security object was retired in 2011. Moving it to the top of my list of #ThingsIdSaveInAFire.
Why do they make the green Tums? Nobody likes the green Tums.
@DonnaDPool @lenoreriegel @eyeonannapolis He sure did! And it was a rout. Very proud of my politician father.
Perfect joy. http://t.co/SoVOy3lMq5
Sundown can't come fast enough 4 all you Jews out there. I've made a point to be pregnant or nursing the last 4 Yom Kippurs. Take that, God.
You guys, I am dangerously close to 30K followers. Better not let me get there because that's when my giant ego will explode my head!
@japmap2009 You will be cursing my name under a monsoon of tears.
Remembering the victims of 9/11. And our troops who lost their lives or sustained battle scars since that day. Physical or otherwise.
@RadBren13 Um... maybe. (I like white!) Sorry about that. I'm just using it as a bulletin board!
@OGSasha Ah.Ma.Zing.
I'm having a sick day. I think I was traumatized by Jack's first day of school. (Jack was not.)
ICYMI, my reunion with @Theehendrickson, @gregrikaart, and @MillerLoLife inspired us to dredge up this little gem: https://t.co/Mti3BJ5Y4w
Oh oops. Was making gluten free brownies for @Theehendrickson. The batter was suspect! http://t.co/ix0r1PrcN1
By the way, they're baked now. Turns out my expectations were even too high. Yucky yuck.
My sister's movie gets a big distribution deal after a "rapturous" reception at #TIFF! So proud! http://t.co/arvayeccOD
@cmkilgo Don't worry, Hun! I'm not mad or anything. It's all good. You're very cute.
@cmkilgo In the room we all talked. Equally. And I left early so not sure how I could "hog" after I went home.
@cmkilgo @MORE_AMC @L_Hartley Dude chill. We taped an over 2 hour interview. They cut it not me. There will be several installments.
@samriegel Trust me, he's charging plenty.
My Lima Bean has become quite the workout companion. Giving me belly nudges like "Nice work, mom!" and kicks, like, "Don't you stop now!"
.@FYeahJackMiller started the morning like he often does. Rockin' out to @SincerelyDenyse's "Better than Nothing." http://t.co/U1NgYHvXzB
#Broadchurch broke my heart into a million pieces last night. Not sure I'll ever recover.
@Alana_DeLaGarza Love this! I'm your mom, too. Lol.
@MBsandsKU What?! Get out! Happy birthday!!
@RadBren13 @iBrockely Yeah. ALL over that. It's even in my dreams.
Hey, Twitter. How you been lately? How about that Miley Cyrus, Ben Affleck and Breaking Bad, huh? Crazy! What else did I miss?
@iamkellyoverton I know the culprit and she does! #joiedevivre
@samriegel Since you became old and less picky.
@paulagarces1 @OWNTV We are super cute! Can't wait for dueling bellies in Pine Valley!
@Theehendrickson @gregrikaart This must mean you guys are alive. Although I've seen no evidence of this. Lets fix that, pretty please?!
Ah, Ikea. The place that's such a good deal I end up spending twice as much. (I'm looking at you, too, Costco, Target and Children's Place.)
@jlac @ColinHanks @MillerLoLife @BenBlacker The ink laughed at our organic baby wash. Don't think it will ever recover. Totally humiliated.
Bagels by @jlac &amp; @BenBlacker made this morning's brunch one for the books. I'm a New York Jew who's never had them homemade until today!
2-year-old made me chocolate chip pancakes this morning. A little light on the chocolate chips for my taste. Damn kids.
Turns out today is prime time for back-to-school shopping at Staples. Bad time to unexpectedly run out of printer ink.
@Genesrchr Fun poor is way better.
Wouldn't ya know it... Me too! RT @L_Hartley: On my way to @MORELeslieM to talk about #amc with @JillLarsonAMC &amp; @edenriegel @allmychildren
I've now sold two things on eBay and two on Cragslist! I'm so proud and had no idea being poor could be this fun!
You should all follow @Chandra_West because not only was she @MillerLoLife's best man at our wedding, he was the maid of honor at hers.
It is sadly true, as @AbsoluteEden reported. My shooting schedule has changed and I can no longer make the Fan Luncheon. My heart is broken.
@japmap2009 @TamaraBraun I know, right? The only way to watch it is to binge. #OITNB
I wish. RT @pattonoswalt: FUUUUUCK. One episode left. #OITNB
@McGeeinNWA Judgemental, Shmudgemental. I feel like people need to know that's not okay. I've heard 50% of car seats are used improperly.
Yet another reason I curse my common birth.
So clearly being royalty means you can skip actually reading the manual on how to strap an infant into a car seat. http://t.co/qQe5apvsvu
Husband is out which means no #OITNB tonight. Will have to make do with #OrphanBlack. Rough life, eh? #EmbarrassmentofRiches.
@BenBlacker Kraft dinner and brownies while my husband is out. Then again I am pregnant. @MillerLoLife
My last tweet was just a test to see how cool you all are. You passed.
@paulagarces1 @allmychildren Likewise, beautiful! What a delightful day! Can't wait to work together in CT and discuss cravings and bumps.
@celebritygifts Oh, excellent. I'm glad I wasn't too subtle. But after all that's not usually my problem. LOL! You are amazing.
I only wanted to eat the chicken that's smarter than all the other chickens and absorb its power.
@MillerLoLife Retweeted*! (*under duress)
I actually signed my unborn child up for preschool today. No joke. It's cutthroat out there.
@alicia_minshew @DramaTweetBrad Huh? What?! Can this be true?! Text me, mama!
Seriously it's gonna be so much fun! I've been know to do highly embarrassing things at fan lunches. Bring your camera phone! @AbsoluteEden
Have lunch with me at my fan club luncheon, August 24th in Connecticut! I hate eating alone! Info and deets here: http://t.co/NSyk17QUHc
@AbsoluteEden You're so awesomely inappropriate! &lt;3 you.
And for those who thought my intuition was infallible, I was sure I was having a girl. Proving once and for all I am, alas, only human.
Jack is going to have a (drumroll, please!)............... little brother!!
@DanJKroll @alicia_minshew This tweet makes me so happy! I agree!!! #WeStillGotIt!
@ChristinaBLind Dear girl, I am so happy for you both! What a lucky son-of-a-classy lady that Gene is! Love to you!
Thank you notes have just about ruined present-getting for me. Being an adult basically sucks.
@alicia_minshew @accesshollywood Hey, at least I got the eyes part right! I KNOW you've got one or two of those.
Happy Birthday @Theehendrickson! Everyone needs a Little Lizzie in their life. And if you don't have one, tough luck, you can't have mine.

@kimg5577 aw. Thanks! So glad you caught me on a good day. Lol. Hope we meet again!
I can't help it. Whenever I hear "SCOTUS" it makes me think of "scrotum." #tittertitter
Obviously what I meant to say is AMC fans rule, and we are so fortunate and grateful to have a home on OWN. Better? #sorryoprah
Such great news but I hope Oprah's programmers don't die of shock when people actually watch their network! http://t.co/pMwmkCVWwo
What a day to be an American and, you know, human. Yeah, Love! Adios Doma and Prop 8. #SCOTUSFTW
That's some big bright moon out there.
@ChristinaBLind Can't wait to meet Wendy and give her a BFF or younger beau. I hear she's stunning! (Well, mostly from you, but still.)
@ChristinaBLind Award for sweetest tweet goes to YOU, against stiff competition! And sweetest girl to you, too. By a landslide.
@MillerLoLife I guess you would know, you heartbreaker, you.
@alicia_minshew @MillerLoLife Very classy of you to pretend you didn't totally trick me into telling you a full month ago!
@gregrikaart @MillerLoLife Well put, sir!!! Just think! It could have been yours of you had only been hitting on me in the gym.
@doulasandi Thanks, Sandi!!!!!
@SincerelyDenyse @MillerLoLife Thanks, dear. Don't worry. You're still my favorite. ;)
Hey! Some good news today! Love when unions and management get along. I &lt;3 capitalism. Sometimes.  http://t.co/A2Kys2TlNA
@KoriTalbot Sounds good to me!
Terrible news about Gandolfini. Lost way too soon. A lovely man and great artist. I looked forward to seeing him for years to come.
This trip to Toronto has been a whirlwind of family and food. But Jack and I fit in a few Timbits so all is well.
@japmap2009 Well they couldn't have meant me. They don't even know!!
@RadBren13 You're the second person who's said some version of this. What does it mean?
I'm thrilled to announce today, on Father's Day, that I'm going to make @MillerLoLife, the greatest dad I know, a father all over again!
@jammyprod @lenoreriegel So thrilled to hear it! Boy are we proud of you! So deserved (like your last) and many more to come, surely.
@BenBlacker @jlac @RichardHatem @MillerLoLife I miss you guys. Lets embarrass ourselves in more cities, please.
Farewell Austin and the amazing @ATXFestival season 2. Thanks for treating a couple of Yankees like family. Onto season 3! #atxtvs2
.@MillerLoLife's panels always have the most profanity. You can count on that. @ATXFestival
Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose. #fnl @ATXFestival you made this fan girl's heart go pitter-pat.
Sooooo happy. #FNL #kylechandler #conniebritton http://t.co/UJ4EhaD3GP
@liztigelaar Oh. My. GOD. Why am I still in bed?
@ATXFestival @IamLaceyChabert @julieplec @MillerLoLife Killjoy.
@IamLaceyChabert @julieplec @MillerLoLife @ATXFestival Warm ups, huh? Them's fightin' words!
@julieplec @MillerLoLife @IamLaceyChabert @ATXFestival if Julie Plec wants a Cosette Karaoke show-down it must happen no matter the time.
Texas I love you, but you make my tummy hurt. No more pork an queso. @ATXfestival
About to watch @MillerLoLife panel it up at #ATXfestival!
My exact quote upon tasting the ribs: "Nothing's ever done that in my mouth before!" #ATXfestival
So far Austin has been to me mind-blowing brisket and ribs, banana bourbon pie, and a mean cuppa joe. Instant love! #ATXfestival
@OfficialKJB @IamLaceyChabert Aw, darn. I saw the premier on the schedule and I thought just maybe you'd be there to. Yes to a get together!
@IamLaceyChabert ha!
@ChristyRomano Aw! Not by us. We'd kill to have you there!
@2horns8myhalo @MahDahNah Happy birthday to you!!! So young! MANY happy returns.
@leeawalla There's a temporary shut down due to a labor dispute. That's all I know. I've heard there is confidence it will be resolved.
Heading to TX tomorrow for the @ATXFestival, to hang with @MillerLoLife, my pal @IamLaceyChabert and @emosswilson. You, too, @OfficialKJB?
So, peeps. I'm, like, really upset about this latest hiccup in the life of AMC. But we're a family &amp; I am so hopeful it will be resolved.
Harrumph.
Game of Thrones!!!! #exclamationpoint
Warm cookies and Graeter's and the Smash finale. Guilty pleasure to the power of 3.
@grandmamcclemen My nephew was just born 6 weeks early too! So I have some idea what you're going through. I'm praying for them both.
Happy birthday to my soul sister @alicia_minshew! I want to say so many dirty things to you right now. Not in a sexy way, mind you.
@BostonCourt Counter Burger.
Jack's birthday at Travel Town was a success! The proof? He's passed out and I'm hopped up on birthday cake. A good time was had by all.
@DanaPiccoli That was SO funny! I caught up on the other recaps while I was at it. I am really touched!
I'm still continually impressed with the way President Obama pronounces Pakistan.
Miranda, you can get away with a lot, but do not bad mouth the Depp. Or call Erica "Gammy." OMG, you're grounded! http://t.co/n9a6NdD7A9
My son's just in his crib belting out Taylor Swift instead of sleeping. Just a normal average night in the Miller household.
Happy 2nd Birthday to @FYeahJackMiller! And thanks for giving me two years of the best days of my life.
Wow! I guess everybody liked Bianca giving JR hell on today's @allmychildren. I must say it was satisfying! http://t.co/8BgalHJdvp
@RadBren13 @DonnaDPool @japmap2009 Cute pic! We look delightfully deranged! Thanks for coming out, Bren. That was hella fun!
@AbsoluteEden @japmap2009 She was and she did a helluva job along w/ Bren. I almost didn't miss you! (BTdubs, totes lying through my teeth)
@japmap2009 I was SO happy to have you there! Always a pleasure to spend time. Thanks for the pressies. And for the endless support!
@AnneschmidtNy Honey I'm so sorry. I've been abysmal about twitter lately and didn't see this. We just closed! Blergh. Next time!!!
Happy Mother's Day, @lenoreriegel! My twitter skills may pale next to yours, but fortunately in mothering I'm a chip off the old block.
@SincerelyDenyse He calls it the "higher higher" song, which is his nickname for swings. That's his favorite part!
@SincerelyDenyse Thanks, love! My son loves your video, by the way. He requests it all the time. We've downloaded the song to his playlist.
@gregrikaart You guys had something special.
I am terribly sad to hear of #JeanneCooper's passing. What a fine lady she was. Talented, huge heart, funny as hell, and sexy to the end.
Great chat with fans yesterday about the @allmychildren reboot. Watch it here: http://t.co/vjjUa9bE1M Thanks            ‏@MichaelFairman!
I'm so happy to hear everyone is enjoying the @allmychildren reboot! A return to form, in my opinion, and don't we all look pretty?
@tilnightfall @allmychildren I'm not a regular!! I'm a "special guest star."
@DeafAngelboy23 @allmychildren @SincerelyDenyse I completely agree. Talent to spare! Share some of that with the old folks like me, will ya?
@carrie_trask It's the fountain of youth! Just ask La Lucc!
@MichaelFairman @allmychildren @realcadymcclain LOVED IT!!!
@spacelamb @PepsiCo Oh my God, that's horrible! I can't believe what I just saw.  Want to scrub my eyes and soul.
It's #AllMyChildren premier day! Tune in to Hulu or be square! It's the new, old, cool thing to do.
@MBsandsKU It helped that I don't know what that is and refused to google it.
@GreenButterfly6 @jilllarsonamc @realcadymcclain Hehe!!! So cute!
@johnwalterseip @allmychildren @onelifetolive Unfortunately no I won't be there! I wish I could. So much!
@johnwalterseip @EricNelsen @SincerelyDenyse This actually made me cry. Dramatic stuff!!!
@PrattFalls LOVE!!! Dangerous proposition. The three of us might overheat your wifi connection. KaBOOOM! Happy Birthday, Portia!!!
@RichardHatem @BostonCourt @latimes @MillerLoLife Thanks, Mr. Of Green Gables. Can't wait to see you guys!
@tracyeliott you were here?! Wow! I wish I had seen you after the show. Glad you enjoyed it!

@MBsandsKU No. Good eye. It was before I arrived. I would have killed it.
On some things I will not compromise. It's doughnuts, not donuts. Yogurt, not yoghurt. Through, not thru.
Am I missing something? Is this something people forget to do? http://t.co/UZQm0bDiyl
Doughnut holes are pure evil. So little and cute and unassuming and before you know it you've eaten 3 doughnuts worth.
AMC2.0 has a juicing station and a make-your-own-pancakes set-up. So don't be surprised if there are no more skinny people in Pine Valley.

Ah the warm bosom of my All My Children family. Oh, right. Those are just my bosoms.

@HartSlater Oh well, there you go! I gotta stop believing the internets.
Today I start rehearsals for a new play at @BostonCourt theater and the next chapter of #AMC starts shooting. No case of the Mondays for me!
Happy birthday to the love o' me life and the guy I most admire, @MillerLoLife. Can't even snark because I'm just too grateful you exist!
@ChristinaBLind I can't tell you how much this means to me. But I'll try: You are so beautiful, generous of spirit and lovely. Thank you.
@ Christina Blind I can't tell you how much this means to me. But I'll try: You are so beautiful, generous of spirit and lovely. Thank you.
So I guess I better follow my... ahem... daughter: @JordanLanePrice Gabby, you're still to young for twitter.  I hope.
Saw Steve Nash live last night, today the Kings. It's supposed to be @MillerLoLife's birthday celebration but it kinda feels like its mine!
Thank you all for the outpouring of support today. I am thrilled to be returning as Bianca!  http://t.co/8S0eBfnk1G
@PrattFalls Don't worry.  That's just what the kids are calling it these days.
Jack Oscar Miller is 21 months today. Everybody do a shot of pasteurized organic whole milk fortified with Vitamin D and Omega 3 for him!
@singlegirl66 Beautiful!
@AbsoluteEden @billdelia @MondayMornTNT Yes I do all that, just INSIDE.
So watch it and be (almost assuredly) the first of your friends to see this new program. Start a trend! @MondayMornTNT Monday at 10pm ET.
Received a very sweet email today from dir. @billdelia reminding the cast of our episode's premier this Monday at 10PM ET on @MondayMornTNT!
That Samsung commercial was just like an Apatow movie. Too long and not as funny as you expected it to be.
We got ourselves a ball game!
We got ourselves a ball game! (What I say loudly when anyone on any team does anything.)
@OfficialKJB Let's be catty and live tweet her fashion don'ts!
Does this mean more commercials? #SuperOutageForever
@OfficialKJB So ready. Born ready!
This Super Bowl is nuts!
Happy birthday to my mother, @lenoreriegel!  I'd give her a plus K in motherhood if only I knew what that meant. http://t.co/Jt8dJsxr
@MBsandsKU So you just do what you're told huh? Good to know.
@MBsandsKU Traitor.
@LRNichols @millerlolife Clearly not that crucial. Damn my great immune system! I didn't miss it.
This is really upsetting to me as I am a true-blue two-spacer.  Now I am very conflicted! http://t.co/B00VR12r
@MBsandsKU Unless you're the dodo who left hers behind because she was so flustered from meeting Thomas Keller.
I just tried to scroll an actual paper magazine article with my fingertip. #iPadGeneration
@MillerLoLife You didn't say that last year when you were invited.
@iamkellyoverton Imagine me! With @alana_delagarza And Kelly Overton withdrawal. Oh the humanity.
@gregrikaart That's because it's THE actual Santa. Duh! The Americana doesn't cheap out.
@japmap2009 Don't let him forget it!
@AbsoluteEden :)
@japmap2009 No! I have to look that up!!
@gregrikaart Looks familiar. Now I know he'll turn out great; Like his Uncle Greg. http://t.co/mlEVvEsN
@OfficialKJB Saddest tweet ever and so true!
@MillerLoLife Don't worry, my love. Help is on the way. Take a look at my shopping cart. http://t.co/6gNMfkqq
@AbsoluteEden @welovesoapstv How many years ago?!  That can't be possible! That was like last week!

It begins. http://t.co/n4YTeSOA
My mom just sent me a video of Jack singing Happy Birthday to Mommy. The whole song! What better birthday present could there be?
Can I live-tweet our French Laundry dinner without coming off like a douche? I promise I'll tweet about masterbating more!
Looks like my sexy tweet is my most popular yet. Turns out I've been wasting my time trying to be topical and sarcastic this whole time.
@VoiceOfOBrien I don't have a good grip on anything right now.
@alicia_minshew Somehow I thought you'd appreciate it.
This is a GREAT hotel.
I think I've become one of those people prone to fainting after that bath. They should come with a warning.
Turns out tub tweeting is way more dangerous than drunk tweeting. More fun, too.
Another is how to pleasure yourself with a well-directed jacuzzi tub jet. #thingsthatmakeyougoohyeah
All children and those prone to fainting are kindly invited to unfollow me before my next tweet.
That's just one of the things you learn when your husband works through your vacation.
Did you know that if you soak in a tub long enough you can simply wipe callouses off your feet with an ordinary washcloth?
@_LostInTheHive_ Funnily enough, me too!
.@MillerLoLife's vacation: http://t.co/diO4FZ8I
My vacation: http://t.co/Sa76U6V5
Spending my birthday weekend watching @MillerLoLife stress over his script. Most mistresses aren't this mean. http://t.co/0Tjrd2Cc
@ask_christine yes! That's exactly my trick! I'll post the recipe.
And guess who'll never hear the end of it? Just call him @MillerLoLife.
Guess who made short ribs, banana bread, zucchini muffins, swept the house and did laundry tonight? Just call me Donna Reed.
Can't help it. Boxing Day still summons up the image of old-timey boxers with their pants hiked up to their titties in the ring.
Eating Zingerman's Deli's Chocolate Sourdough makes me wonder why I ever bothered to eat bread without chocolate in it before. @AbsoluteEden
@chrisnathaniel Awwwwwww.... shucks!
Am I the only one who missed this news today? Who else is dying to see grown-up Miranda slutting it up? http://t.co/mv86RWjQ
Let's hold our children close. And be grateful for every moment.
Christians just had to come up with this 12 days of Christmas scam and steal Jewish kids' thunder with their measly 8, huh?
@xtv_addictx HI!  Please don't die!
@Marsha8of9 Very sensible your 10 year old is!
And while we're on the subject, did the Mayans happen to predict their own demise? Because, I mean, wouldn't you start there?
Are we sure the Mayans weren't predicting the fiscal cliff? I bet they were just worried about all of us losing our mortgage exemption.
I no longer have to double-check the spelling on Hanukkah every time I write it, so who's the bad Jew now?
@PrattFalls No wonder!
@mskagen So true! That's it. I'll never be able to food shop!
What I learned today: never go food shopping when you're hungry. Or when you're a total, unabashed pig.
Christmas food porn. http://t.co/oCgGM2dd
@MillerLoLife  So does Shelly only play Dianas?
Peet's peppermint mocha. Mucho mucho mejor. Thanks for the rec tweeters!
@AbsoluteEden This really explains a lot.
@AbsoluteEden A gingerbread latte. Made likely with water instead of coffee. I should know better!
Note to self: just because it's in a red cup and costs $4 doesn't mean it's delicious. #Starbucks
I don't care if he was the son of God, newborn baby Jesus did not smile at the little drummer boy. He had gas.

Paid more for our #BookofMormon tickets for tonight than any show I've ever been to. So I'm going to enjoy it, God dammit. If it kills me.
Happy thanksgiving to all! I'm spending it with my almost-103-year-old grandmother so I have much to be thankful for today!
Congrats, @samriegel! The ladies* love you! (*Ladies ages 2-5) http://t.co/ltGUtgdf

@rieglet Hey! We're here and delayed. Want to meet up?!
New York City closed Central Park today because of a few flakes of snow. Somebody please tell me when New Yorkers got so soft.
@AbsoluteEden So happy you are voting there! #pleasenevermovw

@EmmeRylan I've seen it! It is so scary to watch but I understand totally normal. Sorry honey! That sucks!
@emosswilson @ariellekebbel @liztigelaar @atxfestival Ladies, we all rope. But only Liz bangs.

@PrattFalls @millerlolife @mslisachang I approve this thread.
@karolzinha_k You are an angel. Thank you for saying that!
@samriegel Lies! Or rather, half-truths. I got back up on the asphyxiation horse.
@Lufr010 Me too! :)
@davidlcraddock That's the sweetest tweet! You made my day!
@LRNichols Not enough in my opinion.
The proximity of my VO agent to The Grove has been very bad for my wallet. But very good for Jack's wardrobe.
But if I gave you the answers that would be cheating. #vote
I voted! Easiest multiple choice test I've ever taken.
@Missjen325 @yandr_cbs Aw thanks, that's really sweet.
They weren't kidding with the whole "you turn your back for 1 second" thing re: kids. Except I don't even have to turn my back.
@OrangeCrush83 Yes I do!
@Boslthrman Very funny, Mr.! I do too! ...right?
My dog's been limping like House, MD but now refuses to do it for the vet. He's trying to make me look crazy.
@samriegel @voiceofobrien I kinda felt like I was kicking some ass tonight! Now I know why.
@MBsandsKU @japmap2009 Damnit! What are you the fashion sheriff?
@japmap2009 @mbsandsku It may not be a Stetson, but I'm pretty cowboy'd-up! http://t.co/Gv5TFyYy
@MBsandsKU If I knew what that was I'm sure I would have purchased one.
@MBsandsKU @fyeahjackmiller @millerlolife Well then prepare to be jealous.
@MBsandsKU @FYeahJackMiller @MillerLoLife Jealousy is not an attractive trait.  I'll have you know that's a charger!

@CarrieBTW Oh no!
@VoiceOfOBrien @millerlolife I may have had a bit of a headache this morning.
Resident Evil 6 game launch party in da house! I'm on my 2nd kir royale. So I'm basically drunk tweeting.
@GabbyTheTwangel Well you're already Gabby so how about Miranda? Or Bianca's middle name Christine?

This is late but how much you wanna bet @IBcatherine and @IBheather gave imaginary Obama the time of his life at the RNC?
@TheJenniferHall Just don't get murdered I anything. That poor autopsyist!
@jilldotter Unfortunately probably not. Thank you though! Thanks for the political discourse too.
@jilldotter Well, I'll give you that. I live that you are arguing a side that you don't even agree with, btw. That is SO something I do! ;)
@jilldotter Nope. But what you said is not what he said.
Life cast round 2 a success! Had to use quicker drying formula so it wouldn't get so comfy on my face. It didn't wanna let go yesterday!
I know now that if I weren't so greedy and entitled I'd have a lot more sympathy for those poor billionaires who pay 15% tax like you.
Thanks @mittromney for finally explaining that the reason I support Obama is because I'm on the dole. Now just explain where my checks are.
@Thearose8 There's a silver lining for ya! Xo
Getting my first ever life cast today for a project I'm working on. I'm in a room surrounded by aliens, monsters and preemies. #itsaliving
For this first time tonight when I asked Jack if I could give him a kiss he said no! It's the beginning of the end. #daggertotheheart
@werdyo While I can assure you they are real (and fantastic) I'm very flattered by your post.  Definitely made me laugh. :)
@mapopp84 Oh don't even get me started on Target!
@jbkalicka Aw. Thank you! I'm very proud to be a part of this cast!
Somehow I can't walk out of Rite Aid for under 50 bucks or Costco for less than 300.  #firstworldproblems
Now that football's back I don't really know how we made it through the offseason. Is something I would say if I were the perfect girl.
@EmmeRylan You will live! I promise. But the three hours of tv thing never panned out for me. One episode of Friends a day does the trick!
I really think that John Kerry guy has a future in politics. #DNC

@Ryan_Now Happy birthday to you! (Or unbirthday by now!)

@chrism799 Aw you're sweet. Absolutely!!!
@Josyoperas It's not necessary to tag someone in your tweet when you are criticizing them. In fact I think it's impolite.

Just watched Ryan Lochte's interview highlights. All I can say is it's a good thing that kid can swim.
My tweet on The Voice commercials airing on the Olympics is the closest I will ever get to gold.
The women's synchro teams bathe together after dives but the guys take turns at the showers. Because that would be too homoerotic, I guess.
Oh my god, you guys. Male synchro diving is so stinking cute! From the itty-bitty little 'nanner-hammocks to their perfectly pointed toes!
.@MillerLoLife just diagnosed my coughing and sneezing as Olympic fever. Phew!
@VoiceOfOBrien Well, you are the Graeter's-est. Glad it didn't melt. (It didn't, right?) I'm very grateful!

Just sitting at home alone, watching Friends reruns, and cackling like a moron.

Had to work extra hard at @Physique57 today to try to keep up with pal @IamLaceyChabert, who rocked it! Strong &amp; beautiful's a killer combo.
Happy birthday to the woman most responsible for our nation's independence, @Theehendrickson. Oh right, I mean our nation's cuteness.
@LRNichols I like your tweet.
An episode of Newsroom is like four of any other show. I mean just in terms of words spoken.
Check out @MillerLoLife's new profile pic. Unless you hate cuteness.
Um... How do you do a tribute to two beloved long-running soaps and not show a single clip? #DaytimeEmmys

Kiiiiiiiiiiings! I couldn't be happier except if the Leafs, Rangers or Capitols had done it. In that order.
#TSC fans are attempting to trend "thank you Andrew". Just doing my part!
Thank you Andrew for creating and executing a brilliant season of television. You just keep surpassing my expectations. Over and over.
@lenoreriegel  Whatchoo talkin' bout, Willis?
I just watched the Walking Dead, I mean, Game of Thrones finale.
Fassbender's nothing special. It's just that his body's so wee, it makes certain parts look... enlarged. Proportionally. #meh
@MSLisaChang Oh no! Say it ain't so! I love him. Should I skip it?
I ran 6 miles in 80 degree weather today and all I got was this lousy tweet.
Is it true that Y&amp;R has a blueberry now? Dude. No bueno. #JackOscarMiller #TheOriginalBlueberry #TheOnlyBlueberry

@lenoreriegel Wow, indeed.  Great fans the circle has.  So says Yoda.
It's summer out there, kiddos. Wear your SPF! http://t.co/9ClpXrE0
@lenoreriegel @MSLisaChang Now I know why not!
@lenoreriegel @MSLisaChang That rascal Jack changed my carry-on-only policy. And our friends were checking anyway so we thought why not?
By the way, @AmericanAir sent us a travel voucher. So the lesson here is when you're dissatisfied be dissatisfied loudly.
Reminds me of the study that said our names influence our career path. Like Mr. Smiley becomes a dentist and Storm Newton a meteorologist.
Can't believe I just realized Bernie Madoff "made off" with lots of other people's cash. Imagine the NYPost was way ahead of me on that one.
Each episode of #Girls leaves me with a feeling of consuming emptiness. I wish I could scrub the images off my eyeballs.
Got to channel the customer service reps' utter lack of accountability and compassion for my next villain role. @AmericanAir
@MSLisaChang I was always a carry-on girl. And will be again. Especially now.
Our trip pics would all be Andrew on the phone getting no help but lots of attitude from @AmericaAir. But I was too depressed to take them.
What's a funny way to say @AmericanAir robbed us of our hard-earned vacation and lost my bags twice in one week? Oh right, there isn't one.
It may have taken 2 days to get here, and our bags may still be lost, but that's a mocha latte &amp; the ocean behind it. http://t.co/VHK8brj6

@doulasandi Oh thank you, Sandi!! How's everything?
@yuwang1 Great book! I loved it, too!
@MangoJayakody I read it and loved it! Great one!
I missed the eclipse! I chose not to look at the Internet the one day it wasn't a total time suck.
Jack's actual birthday is tomorrow but the party is today. Which means I can just have fun and save the boo-hoos for tomorrow.
@EmmeRylan I'm looking at Shadow of the Wind and 11/22/63
@EmmeRylan I've already read 50 Shades but that's a popular suggestion. Or maybe just from my kinky fans. ;) They know me well.
What am I going to read on my summer vacation? I look to you, good people of Twitter!

@Laura_AllenLA I'm sorry about your show, Laura. Andrew's show didn't go either. But great things are ahead for you! I promise.
@jdwright25 I heard about your surgery. Get well soon, you champ, you! We're all behind you!
You all geared up for #TheSecretCircle's epic finale tonight? It promises the usual thrills and chills but, you know, finale-sized. #TSC
Of course @Radiolab's giveaway is awesome. The nerdy sciencey version of a lighter for this concert of brainiacs. http://t.co/ymMj2bSH
@alicia_minshew Who says my ass wasn't sweaty?
Makes me feel kinda like I have a very large very attractive family. #soapsiblings
Two mediocre auditions today made marvelous by encounters with @jeffbranson and @alicia_minshew in the waiting rooms.
Today's shaping up not too shabby. Our fearless leader done good.  #ThanksObama #Finally #FulfillingthePromise
@Theehendrickson Like you need one. Lol jk. I am SO happy for you girl! Deserved doesn't begin to cover it.
It's @MillerLoLife's last late work night of season 1 #TSC! He has mixed feelings about that. I have no mixed feelings. #100%relieved
@MSLisaChang Did you see that horrid brown plaid potato sack with the misbuttoned buttons? Two episodes ago. Took a month off my life.
@MSLisaChang Must burn Chico's! (Probably can't get away with burning Chinatown.)
I shit you not, I'm auditioning for something called "Raging Bull 2" tomorrow.
And an ode to Debra Messing's fabulously horrible wardrobe. #Smash http://t.co/KtvC9a8Z
"Why would I go out of my way to watch a show that makes me so mad?" The glorious sport of hate-watching #Smash: http://t.co/7cwLtjcM
The problem with being an adult is I bought a jar of maraschino cherries yesterday and really what's to stop me from eating the whole thing?
I'm so excited to see Krulwich and Abumrad in the @Radiolab Live show tomorrow I've got butterflies. Calling me an #NPRNerd is being polite.
My nephew Max born the same week we lost the incomparable Maurice Sendak. Coincidence? I think not. Well, actually, I think so. Still cool.
@japmap2009 Sounds kinky. Me, @MillerLoLife, and a point and shoot tonight.
@MillerLoLife You're gonna have to better than that to scare me off. You've been going to the dermatologist next Tuesday for 3 years now.
Well, @MillerLoLife? RT @AndrewWMarlowe: Today I'm celebrating the end of the season the way most showrunners do. I'm going to the dentist.
This happened by accident. http://t.co/qpld7nOl
It's like Christmas morning every Saturday afternoon thanks to @pricepeterson. &lt;3 him all kinds. http://t.co/kisgML06
@samriegel You never did those things before! Now you just have a good excuse.
I wish @pricepeterson would photo recap Goon. I need to relive that again. Slowly. Frame by frame.
Cassie and Diana are just begging for a staph infection. Or tetanus. Open wounds and high school floors don't mix. #TSC
Uh-huh. Sushi and Secret Circle with my spouse tonight. While our son sleeps. Them's some super S's.
Don't forget to watch a brand new #secretcircle tonight on CW.  Can't wait to see how witches do prom! Flaming corsages perhaps? #TSC
@MBsandsKU I can always count on you to appreciate my sense of humor.
@OfficialKJB Did you notice the one button intentionally mis-buttoned. WTH?
Just what exactly is Debra Messing wearing on last night's episode of #Smash? I can't snark about it, I'm too shocked.
@PaganSoul366 that's just fine by me! Thanks... ;)
@AllMyLesbians Don't worry. This bothers me not in the least. I wish her the best of luck. I kinda forgot I was ever on that show.
How do I unfollow RTs?
Sad that my Toms no longer declare me caring humanitarian. How am I going to prove that now? I mean, with footwear?
Ack! Pic! Stunning necklace. @Alana_DeLaGarza http://t.co/pudcSYpK
An incredible lady made me this necklace today. Talented, gorgeous and throws a great party. And real! @Alana_DeLaGarza - Follow follow!
@MillerLoLife Sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
#FF ol'-school #AMC: @alicia_minshew @CameronMathison @joshduhamel @rebeccabudig @Susan_Lucci @kellyripa @markconsuelos @wwilley
That song just follows Faye around and plays whenever she takes her shirt off. In the heart of every red-blooded American male. #TSC
@alicia_minshew By the way, absolutely everything I say on twitter is sarcastic. That's my only rule.
@alicia_minshew No such thing! Just call it twetiquette and do whatever you want. That's what I do and it's gotten me in no trouble at all.
@AbsoluteEden Rad. And ouch!!
@dhewlett @millerlolife You're so welcome.  And I'm soooo sorry.
I can just see it, next year Cassie gives birth to a smoke monster. #GoT #TSC
The rules of The Thirteen were clearly sourced from a Book of Shadows. That palm cutting is so Chance Harbor. #TSC #GoT
P.S. Another of those handful of places is our living room.
Yep, @MillerLoLife was the nerdiest guy in the room at one of a handful of places I've ever been to where that's a good thing. #nerdist
Nerding it up at the Nerdist panel. About to geek out over @MillerLoLife.
@PrattFalls Happy birthday to Portia! If only I hadn't broken my chocolate fast after mere days I promise all my chocolate would be yours!
So I understand my girl @alicia_minshew has joined Twitter. Will wonders never cease? Let's be gentle with her. Coax her raunchy side out.
.@pricepeterson's recap was nice to read last night and equally so this morning. Bet it's just as nice tomorrow. http://t.co/6fBJ4Okh
The day I quit chocolate I decided to take up drinking. Pretty fair trade, I must say.
@Chrishell7 I &lt;3 being on this list.  Hiy-yah! (Karate sound)
@MillerLoLife He usually gets Billy Joel. You've been missed.
Oh my God, my heart is pounding in my chest. The last minute of #SecretCircle took my breath away!
It's just not an episode of #SecretCircle till someone gets cut.
I think I'm gonna skip that private voodoo island Callum is so high on. #SecretCircle
Charles and Blackwell fighting is almost too sexy for this gal. With @MillerLoLife here this house is busting at the seams with masculinity.
@chicmamablog Oh wow! That's so interesting and I did not know. Fortunately this time I didn't.
@AbsoluteEden Glad my hallucination helped in some way, however.
@AbsoluteEden I agree with the others. Are you sure? I make it a rule never to trust memories made while on a Vicodin drip.
@ingridkavelaars I just like to be prepared...  And I've heard horror stories!
@Flower4444 I was carrying way too much for that!
Okay, done! It's safe to come out again.
Not a bad idea to bring earplugs & candy bars for those next to you. You can bribe your way to a pleasant flight. And maybe a helping hand.
And, lastly, enough toys to change up and some with irritating lights and sounds for emergencies. Annoying but better than a crying babe.
Waterproof cover for checked car seat, unless you want a soppy car seat left out in the rain.
A light, easily collapsible stroller like the City Mini or B-Agile for a quick getaway on the jet bridge.
Clorox or verbena wipe the crap out of seat, tray table, seat belt, everything, the second you sit down. The seat belt is the best toy.
When they're done they play with the packs! Extra free toy! (Only supervised! Not safe for solo play.) But Jack was on my lap so no worries.
Stock up on these rad squeeze-packs. Here's Jack eating one from @ellaskitchen. Organic, delicious, no spoon, no mess! http://t.co/s2VsVFcm
Never know how long you could be stuck on the Tarmac or stranded overnight with no access to checked baggage.
First, enough diapers and food (formula, too) for 24-48 hours (depending on how much you worry) for your carry-on!
I want to tweet a survival guide for traveling with an almost-1-year old. So tune out for a bit if this doesn't apply to you.
For those asking for video proof, brining my phone in there would have increased the risk. I'm a thrill-seeker, I don't have a deathwish!
This morning I did the electric slide in the shower. That may have been the riskiest behavior I've engaged in in my life. I survived.
Tonight's #SecretCircle is brand new! Watch it with someone you love. (Or love it with someone you watch, you sicko.)
@S_Bian75 @theehendrickson There's room for two.
My first day of 2 weeks without chocolate has landed me with a massive headache. I am officially an addict. #withdrawal #chocoholic
Happy birthday to my former/current/always lady love, @TamaraBraun. Have a great one you beautiful broad you.
But congrats to Lena Dunham. No one has ever made New York seem less appealing. As a native New Yorker I know what a feat that is.
Worried that my dislike of the #Girls pilot makes me a disgrace to my sex and generation.
Yes, @TamaraBraun was fabulous tonight. What a vixen! Glad I don't have her in my head everyday.
About to see my lady @TamaraBraun in her play. I will report back but my educated guess is that she will rock.
The Root Beer/Dr. Pepper/Coke combo sweetens the deal.
First night celebrating @MillerLoLife's freedom and we ended up at Chipotle. Just goes to show I can be anywhere with my baby and be happy.
@tylerag97 Lol. So true.
In fact I'd like to be in them, please. #50shades
Just so you don't think I'm a stick in the mud, I did enjoy my visits to the Red Room of Pain. And I will be seeing the movies. #50shades
@donnaruff I don't want I ruin it for you. Maybe you'll love it!
@TamaraBraun @yuwang1 @prattfalls @christinablind @sarahglendening I love that idea!!
@MSLisaChang @millerlolife You are one smart lady.
#50shades was a big letdown. How can so much sex be so unsexy? I'd ask my inner goddess but I've heard just about enough out of them lately.
@bobguiney @millerlolife You're on!
A huge congrats to @MillerLoLife  for wrapping shooting on season 1 of #TheSecretCircle. I'm in awe of what he's accomplished this year.
@MillerLoLife Well, the deal was you'd share me with 6 hot witches, too. So we're good.
It's as fun to shop for toys now as it was when I was the kid. No. More fun. Because now I've got the credit card.
@IamLaceyChabert What?! You do @Physique57, too? Let's do it together sometime. Friends who sweat together, fete together!
@WitnessUganda Only thing missing from that picture is a cute white girl.
@PrattFalls If I had it to offer I would have! We were sharing an aisle seat. This was just while the lady next to me was in the lavatory.
World traveller. A kid I'd actually like to get stuck next to in the plane! http://t.co/hpuxE9mP
@MillerLoLife I do not approve. But I suppose you need something to fill the void in your heart. And I hear the stomach is close enough.
@MillerLoLife You know Jack. He's got expensive taste in milk. And prostitutes.
Obviously that last tweet should have read "Colour me impressed." Now when you use cash, you can still be paying with plastic.
New PLASTIC Canadian money here in the Big Smoke. With peekaboo window, holograph photo & Braille! Color me impressed. http://t.co/xaQvkx9d
@samriegel Wow. That's pretty good!
@Theehendrickson @EmmeRylan Oh, do share! I need easy and healthy in my life!
We're cute! RT @AllMyLesbians Here are @EdenRiegel & @IAmLaceyChabert in the role of Young Cosette in Les Miserables. http://t.co/nF7VqppC
P.S. The very best place to keep new light bulbs when ascending a ladder is in one's decolletage. This has been beta tested by yours truly.
I bet my step ladder thought it would have a way easier life when it saw me coming toward it in the store. I'm giving it a workout today.
I've been trying all year to like @millerlolife less and I think I'm no closer than when I started. In fact I may be further away.
@MSLisaChang I didn't really hear a word you said except "thin." Yipeeeeeee!
@GoLLiTo_frybyrd You are so sweet!
@samriegel Because I am a harlot and a scoundrel.
But what shall we call ourselves now? Can we all agree the name SAG-AFTRA sucks? We all agreed on one thing already today.
Oh, dear! A brand new #thesecretcircle starts in just one minute, East Coast!
Thanks to @Physique57 I woke up with actual abs today. And I'm #notpaidtotweet. Except in, like, muscles and encouragement.
Went ahead and bought a step ladder today. Don't tell me I'm not embracing this no-husband thing whole hog. #realwomenchangetheirownbulbs
Thanks solely to you guys watching me on #NCIS last night, it was the most watched show of the night. For sure that's, like, a first! #JK
"People have killed for a lot less." Ha! Atta girl, Meredith! #NCIS
Even though we know all the good shows on TV air on the CW Thursdays at 9, I suppose I'll make an exception and watch #NCIS now on CBS.
Thanks for all your nice tweets about #NCIS. You guys are making me less scared to watch!
@TamaraBraun That is for sure overtired/lackofsleep/stress. I got that in college all the time.
The upside is I've never had such a large audience at once before. The downside is that's a lot of eyeballs to be embarrassed in front of!
I would tell you all to watch me on #NCIS tonight but I think basically most of America already watches. ;)
@emilymontague1 Yeah! As we're pretending to chatter over coffee or something!
I think I read entirely too little porn. Currently downloading 50 Shades of Grey. Andrew, you can go ahead and stay at work tonight.
@AbsoluteEden I wasn't clear. He'll still have to work a crapload. Just hopefully no more all-nighters.
I think this might be @MillerLoLife's last all-nighter of the season! (I hope, I hope...)
Guess what didn't get done again this weekend? @MillerLoLife's "Honey-Do" list. Fast becoming the "Not a Chance in Hell" list.
If nobody else understands what @MillerLoLife is doing, this guy does.  Thank you, @pricepeterson. Thank you. #TSC http://t.co/HSFATcL5
Reading #Smash recaps while I wait, patiently... http://t.co/6YGKbzyk
@PrattFalls You just took it to a whole other level.
Anybody else miss apostrophes and periods when typing on their computers now because they're so used to autocorrect? #InformationAgeProblems
@AbsoluteEden That's sad until I remember Global Warming will have killed us all by then.
@AbsoluteEden Chiquita Banana would beg to differ. (Jk, I know that banana trick, but let's just pretend I don't, shall we?)
@anobid It's a sin to waste them, obvs! (*maniacal laugh*)
Late #FF, Girlfriend's Guide to Twitter Edition: @IamLaceyChabert @iamkellyoverton @Laura_AllenLA @BrookeNevin @TamaraBraun @Theehendrickson
Confession: I always buy too many bananas, secretly hoping they won't be eaten and I will "have" to make chocolate chip banana bread.
@Marsha8of9 That works, too!
@pricepeterson I'm totally 'shipping Pizzaice right now. Especially if it means a recap is imminent.
Ugh, actors! ...Am I right? (Sing it, sister.)
Blackwell really is as evil as they come. Did you see the pain he put his daughter through without even flinching? Gave me goose flesh. #TSC
@EmmeRylan Nope. Not totally alone. I'm there with ya!
What? It's Thursday already? That means a brand new #TSC! It's a big Cadam episode so this Thomas-Decker-bedroom-eyes fan is very excited.
@MBsandsKU Uh oh. Time for a cute-off!
@DonnaDPool Agreed. Thanks, darling.
@mefullofJoy I got such a perverse thrill from your tweet! Thanks for that.
@TraynorLand Your tweet makes it triple!
I am going to try really hard to be this happy today.  Even if I fail I'll still be plenty happy! http://t.co/fM4Zv0yD
@Jamey_Giddens &lt;3 U.
Trust me, the microphone picks up how cool we are in the booth. @samriegel @redheadsaidprod @emilymontague1 http://t.co/qSze6mNJ
@DaveCable1 It does help. Thank you!
@AllMyLesbians No chocolate neither! This IS serious!!!
You know you're depressed when you're too bummed out to eat a Pinkberry.
That's totally Faye and Melissa behind me. You see that classic Faye snark? https://t.co/QhoqBj0a @MillerLoLife
@MBsandsKU (big snorty laugh)
That's me on the right! RT @lenoreriegel: @edenriegel was be-witching even before The Secret Circle http://t.co/q3LnzTrL
@julieplec You sure got big plans for your 10 days off.  @MillerLoLife has jury duty.  Of all the luck!
.@ThisAmerLife's Mike Daisey retraction episode is sad and spellbinding. I have a great deal of respect for how Ira Glass handled it.
@RadBren13 @mbsandsku @donnadpool @absoluteeden The only solution is for you all to fight to the death in a Hunger Games-style battle.
@AbsoluteEden Dr. Eden is always happy to help. I'll send you a bill.  I accept all insurance with a $1,000 deductible.
@pixiejules77 Yep.  That about sums it up!
@AbsoluteEden Aw, U R 2 Quut! I don't do RTs but I love your vodka and didn't know Eve was drunk when she ate the apple. LOLolS x 2 = :)
Had to share the #Bully trailer. Please watch and RT and let's end bullying. http://t.co/abTNeIOI
Will Andrew finish breaking the last episode of #TSC today? Or will it finally break him? #TVLingoFunies
Oh, just reading @pricepeterson's recap again. Then totes securing a weekly appt with Dr. Melissa before she books up. http://t.co/BV3Yly2R
@PrattFalls God, I love her.
Adore this #SecretCircle recap. Kinda want to marry it. Wonder what Dr. Melissa would have to say about that! http://t.co/BV3Yly2R
@sharonlcase Oh, that's so sweet!  I'm thrilled that you're liking it. I'm a very proud wife! Isn't Graz great on it?
@soaprookie @TVGuide :) Very nice! I feel vindicated/validated.
@Budini I hear ya. I just think it's too soon. I haven't had a chance to like the Julia character yet. Now I already can't stand her. &amp; him!
Watch the Circle tonight or be square. (I have just officially become my father.) #TSC tonight at 9 on CW. #thesecretcircle
@AprilMashelle No, I'm sorry, I'm not! My husband created the show.
This! RT @pricepeterson: #TVD viewers, will you please stay tuned for #TSC?  I want my job to stay this fun next season too.
@Joyce98AG No. He worked from home until precisely the day we had a baby.
@MSLisaChang This is totally bizarre. You just never know with that guy.
I learned from "Blessings of a Skinned Knee" that in Judaism it is believed that our children are on loan from God. Love this idea.
@meagberry At least your husband is fighting for our freedom.  I'm joking, of course.  You have it way worse than me.  Hugs, lady.
@ChivyD Happy Birthday!!!! Hope you have a great one.
@MetLaugh He sleeps too much.
It's a good thing I did all that therapy because this year it's been pretty important that I enjoy my own company. #showrunnerswidow
Happy birthday, @MSLisaChang! You are the business! (I don't know what that means but I know it's good.)
@stephfredricks I FF'd. Does not tell the story and boring. I want to love this show so much!!
BUT, no one can do more with the line "Coming right up" than Thorsten Kaye, am I right? #Smash won me back with the last 20 seconds.
I'm having a terrible cooking night.  Everything has spilled, burned, boiled over... Very grumpy.
@_SoJu_ Yeah. That was gross. I thought so, too.
Adultery is not sexy or appealing, people. And it doesn't make me like your leads. #Smash
@EmmeRylan Yeah!!!! That's terrific. Go Jack Go!
@PrattFalls I noticed that too! What gives?
@MSLisaChang He is SO HOT in person.  And I'm not a Mark Harmon girl. Or wasn't.
Okay, now I can quit Googling myself. My episode of #NCIS airs 3/27 at 8pm ET/PT! Tune in to see me cry (or I might really cry.)
@MillerLoLife Just not all the way. I kid!
@MillerLoLife Amazing.
@gregrikaart Me me me!! Hallelujah!
@RachellHayward Did it!
@RachellHayward no, oops, just slipped my mind. Will email now.
@linnydd No definitely not mandatory. But we want the best for our kids!
@EmmeRylan I would kill to talk to you about your experience with this preschool nightmare!!  Can we have a phone call or a coffee?!
@AbsoluteEden The Japanese have.
On Women's day may I just say how disconcerting it is when an automatic toilet flushes midstream. Of the many advantages this is not one.
.@Physique57 totally kicked my quivering butt and jello-y thighs today. Time to nosh!
@MillerLoLife Mmmmmm. Sexy.
Horrible audition last week resulted in a worse callback today. So two chances to humiliate myself for the same project! Good one, universe.
@dhewlett @millerlolife Trust me, I only left so I could have the pleasure of coming back unannounced and being treated so well again!
@MSLisaChang I would not give that woman a baby either. Very mad right now.
This Michael/Julia thing on #Smash is creeping me out. Doesn't he have a baby son and wife at home? Blech. #killMichael
@MSLisaChang I'll help fan the flames. He's killing my smash buzz.
@MSLisaChang How the hell do they not jiggle... anywhere?!
Love this. Geeking out! RT @tylerag97 @edenriegel The Simpsons' Game Of Thrones intro: http://t.co/3dRtDU1q (via @io9)
The Battle on The Voice just kinda rocked my world. Why do they have to choose? No fair! #Jesse #Anthony (Am I really watching reality?)
@tvcat1 I do!! Sorry if I missed you before. I've definitely seen your tweets.
@tvcat1 Ha! Too funny. Different strokes...
I just saw a commercial as long and incomprehensible as The Tree of Life. #Cartier
@MillerLoLife Don't forget to give Obama a piece of your mind, too.
@MillerLoLife Not you. Working stiff.
@kevinmalao I'm very touchy on the subject, I guess! I don't want you to think I'm lazy or anything.
@MaliaBeermann Happy birthday!! Have an amazing one!
@kevinmalao Whaaaa? I watch like one night a week! That's not a lot!
I nominate @leslieodomjr's Sam as the most instantly likable character on tv. Nice work, friend. #Smash
@Kaurisma Smash! But, of course.
No such luck for @MillerLoLife. So I'll have to have enough fun (and sleep) for the both of us. Now that's a challenge I accept!
Wrapped. Home. Lovely day on set. Came home to fleurs from @AbsoluteEden, nothing to study, and a full DVR. Way to end a crummy week!
@Marty2634 yes. I plan to do just that.
What I learned tonight... Food is always the answer.
Just ordered enough sushi to feed 5 people to drown my sorrows in. I know that because they included 5 sets of chopsticks. #feelgluttonous
Tonight #Awake premiers and will knock your socks off.  And that's just the beauty of star @Laura_AllenLA. Dead or alive she's a knockout.
@AbsoluteEden No. What?!
@MsMarceline You win. Hugs lady. Way to put yourself out there like that. Your bravery is inspiring.
@CeeVeeKay I have no idea where he could have picked that up.
Just when I needed a cheer up I see Jack updated his tumblr page. Such a good kid. http://t.co/cckTjssi
@kdobrasz That's unbelievably sweet!! Thank you.
@MillerLoLife @dhewlett That looks so cute on your desk! Nice work, Hewlett.
Nothing like having the opportunity to get rejected 6 times a week. #pilotseason

@LaurenLO113 He totally did.  But is it cool?  Is that okay? I really don't know.
@MSLisaChang If that's what it's called I'm afraid I need to be quarantined!
But, can I also say, who knew Justin Bieber is a totally brilliant actor? and Emma Stone is my new girl crush. Way to go, youngins!
Could it be because Sammy has no race? He is all of us?
Yeesh. I'm ashamed of myself for not even noticing that Billy Crystal performed in blackface at the Oscars.
Hot pockets and diver jackets. And lots of shivering. Now I know I'm on set.
I'm shooting an episode of something this week. Don't mean to be cagey but not sure I can say.
@AllMyLesbians @afterellen @ChristinaBLind Just lovely... Very proud!
@kdobrasz Thank you!  That's very exciting.  I can't wait for 22,222!
@MSLisaChang @katfiore13 @gabrieltigerman @millerlolife Right on! Torrid. Prrrrrrrr.
Happy Bday @MillerLoLife. You were so sleepy you may not remember it but your birthday was amazing! (That's my story and I'm sticking to it)
@MillerLoLife What a great way to spend your birthday! All alone deliriously binge eating... oh, on second though that sounds just awful.
#FF @SteveCarell ...Yes, that's what she said!
@abigailspencer There's a lever on the floor!
@bradwoolf @millerlolife I'm sure Andrew could think of a snarky comment now, but I just want to say bravo! It looks amazing and so fun!

@MillerLoLife @bradwoolf Yeah! You did it! Go Brad!
@Chrishell7 Ha! @TamaraBraun said the same exact thing. Even I think it's me! Almost gotten into more wrecks over it than I care to admit!
Jack turned 9 months yesterday. I was gonna say he's been out as long as he was in but because he had the gestation time of an elephant...
@Theehendrickson Who are you and what have you done with my cynical little friend?
"On the Bubble" and "Chink in the Armor" are my new least-favorite expressions. Blech.
I just realized the only thing worse than speed, slow, or average-paced shopping is not having any money to shop. Yes, #IamTheAsshole.
Speed shopping is even more of a drag than slow shopping. Or average-pace shopping. In short, shopping sucks.
@HeidiDL We are planning to do just that! Omg, of course Thorsten will be there. Too funny.
Awwww... The #TVD episode tonight's called "All My Children." Thanks for the warm-fuzzies, @julieplec!
Jack learned how to clap today. Amazing that he knew the best Valentine's Day present for me would be applause. Smart kid.
@TheJenniferHall Oh, yeah? Well I ran into the beautiful and talented @TheJenniferHall. Beat that!! #ilovelamore

Can't help but keep the champagne on ice for a bit. There will be an appeal. And it still doesn't address recognizing marriage federally.
@elizabethcraft I'd say I agree but not sure which was the offending story. Bates frame-up, Patrick back from the dead, or Mathew's miracle?
Watching The Voice 4 the 1st time marveling at how many amazing singers there r in the world. Does Idol go out of it's way to find stinkers?
Madonna is really rocking the house, am I right? ...hello? (crickets)
Like Obama, I'm just rooting for a good game. And that's not because I have no idea who's playing. Although I don't.
@CeeVeeKay No clue!!
@mummy2logan Aw. That's nice!!
You may have noticed I OH'd my own conversation. That's right. I listen when I talk. Word!
Look at my boys. I am one lucky lady. #handsome #goodgenes http://t.co/FMrIRk9p
OH in our living room. Me: Jack is just a great name. All Jack's are cool. Andrew: Except Jack the Ripper. Me: Touché.
@pjcarone I just can't tell if it's a spoiler or not. What the hell is it all supposed to mean?!
@julieplec My Kindle is my boyfriend most nights, too. In your case your boyfriend is probably very neglected.
Serious tweet: will someone explain the ending of The Artist to me? I don't understand. Does he not want to do talkies cuz of his accent?
@TamaraBraun You will not see any difference. They put all kinds of potions in my hair and nothing happened! I got so ripped off!!
@MillerLoLife Trust me, you are. That girl is so happy it's sickening.
@MillerLoLife Not me. I'm jealous of the me with you here.
Pain au chocolat and a giant mocha latte. I do find ways to fill the void when Andrew is at work. Unfortunately most of them involve food.
@MillerLoLife Not sure, but I think ur still required to tell me how great I look. That was the system the salon staff was operating under.
Oh, whoops. That's not great, either.
My first experience with hair color today. Cost a small fortune, took 3 hours, and looks exactly the same. But at least it smells toxic.
Jack has #asparaguspee. I was sure you all would like to know.
I just realized there's a brand new #TheSecretCircle right now on all my east coast followers TVs right now. You lucky bastards.
@samriegel ugh. Views. Blech.
I've got to be closer by degrees to Kevin Bacon today than ever before.  http://t.co/3rHg9d2A
Wish @MillerLoLife wld do more #LiveTweetingFromTheEditingRoom, Writers Room - Hell, even bathroom. Love seeing his severed torso on my feed
Anyone else think Samantha Barks looks like a less-pretty @Chrishell7?
@sarahmfain You're having quite a year!  Congrats!!!
@PrattFalls @millerlolife I actually tried to give him a +K about crazy sexy but the dumb thing wouldn't let me. It WAS code!
I gave @MillerLoLife +K about Magic on @klout http://t.co/om21BtXa
Question. Women: have you ever actually slapped another adult woman? Or is that just something that happens on TV? #Goodwife
@iBrockely Happy birthday!!!!
@elizabethcraft @MillerLoLife I'm forgetting that happened. & don't get why Daisy'd be psychically connected to a guy she barely tolerates.
Happy birthday to my mother, @lenoreriegel. Now that I'm a mother I understand how awesome mothers are. & how important their birthdays are!
.@MillerLoLife's favorite part of Sunday night is when I tell him everything he slept through on Downton Abbey.
Baby Maddox just made my morning... http://t.co/9GWzrwuu

@Jamey_Giddens @millerlolife The picture doesn't even do them justice! You can't get a sense of the scale. They're huge!!!
@MoztAmazin @samriegel  One word: ew.
.@MillerLoLife knows the way to this girl's heart. Lavish displays of affection. Particularly the tweetable kind. http://t.co/oUOq8smR
So nice I read it twice. (May RT twice, too!) RT @pricepeterson #TSC "WITNESS" recap! I liked this episode so much. http://t.co/MJ20a8vC
Thank you to all the participants of #Biancapalooza including @ChristinaBLind @sarahglendening and @iamkellyoverton. It was so cooool!
#Biancapalooza is coming! Tick tick tick... Boom!
@MBsandsKU I wasn't even thinking that!!!
Last night's amaze-balls #TSC was a real labor of love for @MillerLoLife. And he had a high bar cuz my last labor of love produced Jack.
Awesome new episode of #SecretCircle  #TSC starting now on CW! You can't go there in your mind like Cassie. You gotta tune in!
@MillerLoLife Just know I almost used up a Costco-sized container of butter baking last night. And our entire earthquake supply of Skippy.
My goodness, I like this article! This one's for the moms and dads out there: http://t.co/VR2Zba2d
@AbsoluteEden I don't think it's had much experience.  But I'm sure it would get points for gratitude.
Is Johnny Depp for real? #GoldenGlobes #IKnowIAmLate
Chicago judges are sure some kooky characters! Is there anyone on the bench in this town who isn't a bundle of eccentricities? #GoodWife
@AbsoluteEden Something so heartbreaking and beautiful about a baby who couldn't be touched finally letting go in the arms of his mom.
@SuzanneLan Problem is I see it about as often as my actual husband.  If the re-ran it more, maybe!
Big Bang Theory is my new husband.  Not too bad as spouses go.  It's super reliable but awfully repetitive.
@MSLisaChang Look at little nerd, jr. http://t.co/oSBJlWwU
I allegedly took a 3 hour nap today. I have no memory of such a thing. I was just resting my eyes.
And I love because you snark. RT @pricepeterson: #TSC "FIRE/ICE" RECAP!  (I snark because I love).  http://t.co/3cOT1cWd
@MSLisaChang It's on netflix streaming for free!!
Well, this is fairly cool! No more dirty sneaks! http://t.co/zse9EE3V
There's an excellent new episode of @wnycradiolab.  A real return to form for my favorite podcast. Check it out! http://t.co/R1ru29Jy
My @wnycradiolab hoodie arrived yesterday! Now it'll do battle with my #TSC hoodie every morning. It's science vs. magic. Who will win?
@MetLaugh I'm not sure!  I think it must count for something!
@tylerag97 You have GOT to be kidding me.  That is classic!!!
Hubby's coming home! Is this because I threatened to kiss you all? If so, mmuah!
@tylerag97 good choice!
@MBsandsKU No invite yet. I am hoping hubby gets a last-minute one because the show won. Still very quiet.  Too quiet!
Me too! RT @Heather_D_: @edenriegel "Imagine me kissing you 4 each 1" kind of dirty, but effective, I voted. I'm cheap like that.
K by me! RT @JohnnyRosary @edenriegel Maybe interchanging between you Shelley and Phoebes... K? *clickcliciclciccicllcikclicklcikclick*

Just realized I put twice the amount of butter called for in this banana bread I made. Wish I'd eaten more before making this realization.
@liztigelaar Netflix instant streaming. Make sure you don't have anything to do for 7 solid hours.
Everybody is tweeting about #DowntonPBS and I can't watch it because @MillerLoLife is at work! #whitepretentious1%girlproblems
@pricepeterson Me and DayQuil are in a fight.
I've said it before and I'll say it again: lotta cutting on #SecretCircle.
Sure hope @pricepeterson didn't get empanelled. #TSC Photo recaps totally take precedence over truth, justice and the American way.
You guys excited about a brand new #SecretCircle tonight? My favorite episode yet! (I know I say that a lot but it keeps getting better!)
Okay, BBT, you still have a place in my heart. You remind me of vacay nights with @MillerLoLife. #longlivevacay2011

If you could all vote a whole bunch of times for #TheSecretCircle #PeoplesChoice award we could wipe the floor with those other imposters!
I will always remember Christmas 2011 fondly as when I discovered and fell in and then out of love with "The Big Bang Theory."
Thank you so much for all the birthday wishes. Happy 2012 to you all!! I'm so incredibly happy today!
@samriegel That looks an awful lot like Playboy to me!
@julieplec OMG, couldn't agree more. @MillerLoLife and I had our own holiday GoT marathon. What a riveting ride! I was blown away.
@MSLisaChang @MillerLoLife Dude, that is so Jack!  He even rocks the shades!  Watch out, Vegas.
A very Happy Birthday to @AbsoluteEden's @SillyPhylly! And thank you for another amazing year. So very grateful for you.
My happy place just got happier. #JackatCostco http://t.co/dh0mAmFZ
