I felt the same way when I discovered them as a 5 year old as I do at 30. I remember as a kid getting emo watching any &amp; all Beatles footage
...especially hearing a lot of my heroes talk about how The Beatles changed their lives and inspired them the same way they changed mine.
I'm such a cheeseball. Watching The Beatles piece on @CBSSunday this morning totally made me emotional. Beatlemania is alive and well.

My house just shook. Did anyone else feel that? A 2.8 magnitude earthquake occurred in Los Angeles area. Details: http://t.co/QFx98ocT0r
@HeavenlyAngel06 Glad you like it! Those Turkey burgers are crazy delicious.
@stefwithanfanie @sweetmagdeline um...don't remind me. I think I hold the record at 12.
@shondarhimes Ha! Cheers! I'm having the same :) Truffle popcorn and red wine.

@maisquared thank you :)
Confession: I'm not going to SXSW entirely for music. I'm going for food. @RamenTatsu_ya is at the top of my list. Where else should I eat?
I just spent far too long on @Rooomr (imagining dream vacations I don't really have time for!) Such a great way to travel AND give back.
@anyamarina @beingtricia @TheJennKlein @permichelle @jeweljk @JenKirkman @kayteabeez @joanhiller @saraschaefer1  Thanks! You too!! xx
Ha!! RT @Ryoko_78 this is the 2nd time I've had this dream where  @michellebranch Julie Chen, Ashton Kutcher, Chris O'Donnell &amp; I rob a bank
😂 RT @AaronShure I'm like a chocoholic but with alcohol.

I may have posted this a long time ago but it's worth watching again. Neil Young. Could he be any better? Kills me. http://t.co/9Jl79iqxZx
@uojakaakajou Exactly like that!!!! Haha.
@phototypical whoa. I barely remember that song. How weird!! I'm nostalgic for 90's-2000's too but in a different way.
@boggia Dying to see it.
@boggia :( I knew you would understand xx
60's music specials make me so sad! I feel like I was born in the wrong time :( I wish I was as nostalgic about music from my own generation
Watching 60's Pop Flashback: Hullabaloo on @PBS and geeking out (especially over Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons) So good!
@stefwithanfanie congrats Auntie!

Wait...can Renee read?
Whoa. For real? RT @shondarhimes Adele and Taylor Swift are the same age. Just take that in.
@katevoegele I know. I want her hair...and her voice.
I wonder if the orchestra down the street is really bummed right now.
...
@thesulk damn you. Just stole my joke.
I am so confused. I just turned on the Oscars...what year is it?
@cayucasband Unfortunately, raccoons beat you to the punch. Chicken massacre. We're gonna get some new chicks soon though :) P.S. Big fan!
@ErictheTrainer @CelebritySweat1 @GoldsGym :) any time. Sorry they were late!
@devanskaggs that sounds vaguely dirty 😳
@AshFrag Owen would die! How long? All day??
@mileskmcpherson I guess you do have a point. :*( Yikes. That sucks!
@mileskmcpherson EW! Why didn't you warn me before I clicked on that!!??
Another wild Saturday night! Heading out...to the grocery store because I accidentally burnt my "toasted" pecans. #Baking #Hardcore
