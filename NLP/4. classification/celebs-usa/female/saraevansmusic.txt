Thanks so much to everyone who chatted with us today!  Thanks to @OlayUS &amp; @DailyMakeover for helping me out. #SEOLAYchat
I sat down with Olay makeup artist @brugray recently and went over some of my red carpet tips and tricks. Watch here: http://t.co/FVHcCQnsPv
@bree621 With all the styling my hair can be dry, invest in a good hair oil, put it on wet washed hair. #SEOLAYchat
@Tara515 Maybe you should try the regenerist wrinkle revolution? #SEOLAYchat
@saraevansmusic @bree621 Sorry - I meant the Olay Regenerist Eye &amp; Lash Duo. Love it!
@Stephanie_CYfan Thank you so much!
@bree621 Love the rosebud salve for lips and the Olay false eyelashes! #SEOLAYchat
.@DailyMakeover I'm working on my next album in the studio right now. So excited! I will keep fans updated through my webisodes! #SEOLAYchat
@Tara515 @OlayUS Good skincare starts within. Lots of water, exercise, and maybe a good primer! #SEOLAYchat
.@DailyMakeover @KimKardashian is so gorgeous! And I love her style! #SEOLAYchat
@BENITEZFLORJ @OlayUS I believe in internal beauty #SEOLAYCHAT
@LifebyCynthia @OlayUS That's definitely one of my favorites too! #SEOLAYchat
@CMolis Yes! Members of my fan club can request Meet &amp; Greets for most of my shows! More info here: http://t.co/fbOJuoqXI4
@YanickDg Water and exercise. I do something active every day, like tennis, football with the kids. Keep moving #SEOLAYchat
@JennaHornbaker Well, I have lots of help. It is the only way I could juggle it all. Thanks to my awesome team! #SEOLAYchat
@OlayUS Shower, and then I lay down and KK does all the rest. I use that time to relax #SEOLAYchat
@MNicoTarm @OlayUS I really like the CC cream right now because it fits 3 steps into 1. I can correct, moisturize and repair.  #SEOLAYchat
@caylalovee @OlayUS No, I prefer to have more makeup because my skin can take it. But it really depends on your skin type. #SEOLAYchat
@CMolis @OlayUS  I have to have a great moisturizer. And lots of Sleep and water! See you in Austin!! #SEOLAYchat
@TammySigond @OlayUS Yes, I do, my sister in law, KK, I would be lost without her! #SEOLAYchat
.@tammysigond @stephanie_cyfan I really appreciate skin care that is fast so I like the Regenerist no water wipes or the foaming cloths.
@nikkisixxlover2 @girltalkbytay @OlayUS Also, I have a great makeup artist, KK. She knows my skin well and always finds stuff that works
@nikkisixxlover2 @OlayUS @girltalkbytay Great genes. Thx Mom! I do have to use a great moisturizer like Olay Regenerist. #SEOLAYchat
@YanickDg Well, thx for your compliment! I do like to highlight with a bronzer like Laura mercier bronzing cream. Makes it glow  #SEOLAYchat
@BrowhausNYC @OlayUS I agree. I use the ardell stencil for brows, called Glamourous but I think the false eyelashes are my fave.
I'm excited about hosting @rockthesouth in Cullman,AL! Join me,@HankJr,@thebandperry,@ScottyMcCreery &amp; more 6/21-22! http://t.co/CaROzqnspk
