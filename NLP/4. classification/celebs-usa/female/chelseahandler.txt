@TrumpIsUnstable Signed by me.
On Presidents Day, I’d like to thank the Trump family for my awakening. It drove me to see a psychiatrist, unwrap my own personal injuries, write a book, and film a documentary on white privilege. I am awake because of this presidency, and I choose to stay that way.
Yes. Guns and walls are way more important than education. Clearly. @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/nYqcrvaOZo
@HeatherMatarazz Yeah, it’s a break up. With cancer.
Please watch this and retweet. This is so inhumane. https://t.co/CzsL5qJbEJ
Its really disheartening to think of all the future acting roles depicting Trump’s administration that will go to old fat white men.

@TheRealRoseDiV That’s a cutie.
@Bitchatarian No. He’s gone.

Happy Valentines Day to Robert Mueller, and for him giving his final rose to DonaldTrump, Jr. That would make this holiday really count.
Trump has installed a room-sized ‘golf simulator’ in the White House. So if you’re wondering why we can’t pay those furloughed workers back… now you know.
Um...what? https://t.co/lzvDizRQQm
It’s unreal how dumb @tedcruz is.

I drove down sunset boulevard today looking at tons of billboards promoting shows starring people of color mixed with billboards for cannabis. So, while we are dealing with all of this current madness, there is progress being made. (If you’re into that sort of thing.)
Yes, it doesn’t couple very nicely with your interest in destroying our planet. https://t.co/35q9KdNWdC
Ivanka Trump has “zero concern” about family members being indicted in Mueller probe. Zero concern? YOU SHOULD.
This testimony by our acting attorney general is best summed up as, “FUCK YOU, AMERICA.”
Black history month is one month a year and white people still found a way to make it more about them.
@TopherSpiro Seriously
Mike Pence defended the shutdown by saying it’s “never a mistake to stand up for what you believe in.” What about kneeling for what you believe in? Would love to get your thoughts.
Maybe Virginia should start by asking which elected men didn’t wear blackface, and then we pick the governor from that group?
@TVietor08 Wouldn’t you be if you were him?
Here’s to hoping that once Everything is revealed about Trump and Pence, @SpeakerPelosi will become our first female president and that we will all know the reason why she always smiling.

I have a new book and a new documentary coming out this year. I took the time to focus on the things in this world I can do something about and I’m excited to announce both soon.
In honor of Rosa Parks’ birthday, Ralph Northam should resign as governor of Virginia. There is one part that tolerates and espouses racism, and there are The Democrats.

In preparation for my new book coming in spring—My father always told me to pick one line from a book that summarized the entire book or stuck in your head. He also used to tell me I had to get a job at 6. Tag me with a picture of that line from one of my books and I'll share.
Someone has put on the freshmen indictment 15. https://t.co/7wXBRmbgUe
Donald Trump could be caught blowing Putin on national elevision and Mitch McConnell would say, “I haven’t heard anything about that.”
Trump is expected to spend Super Bowl weekend at Mar-a-Lago. And Sarah Suckabee Sanders will be spending it on the sidelines in case they need an extra linebacker. I’m not body shaming her, I’m saying she’s good at protecting someone with deflated balls.
I’m not sure what a polar vortex is, but I’m pretty sure I lasered all my hair off of mine.
“Polar vortex” sounds like something Fox News would say is coming over the border because we don’t have a wall.
A bakery owner apologized after making “Build that Wall” cookies for Valentine’s Day. I suggest they hold onto them and wait to send them to Donald Trump as his first prison care package.

@Mary65118725 @jonesrlmath No, I didn’t.
Judging by the amount of people who would choose to stop speaking to their family, let’s change it to—you have to choose Manafort, Stone, or Trump, and the reward is this administration ending. Now, choose.
@danacass61 @jonesrlmath You can’t play a lesbian card. That doesn’t get you out of this.
Now that the government is open for 3 weeks, let’s have some fun. If you to have sex with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, or Donald Trump, who would you choose? You can’t choose death. you must choose one or you can never speak to your family again.

Lara Trump said the shutdown is "a little bit of pain" for federal workers but is necessary. That’s also the same thing she says about going down on Eric.
I just read that Orange Wine is the next big trend and I would like to seriously talk to the people who are deciding trends. Nothing good comes in orange… Didn’t we learn that from Donald Trump and the Fyre Festival?
Someone should make a Fyre Festival for all the boys at Covington Catholic. They look like they could use a vacation.

If the government shutdown delays food stamps for millions of families, then Donald Trump should be forced to go without his fast food too. This shutdown would be over by the time his adderall wears off.

I like that one of Native Americans who marched yesterday yelled at all the racist MAGA hat wearers to go back to Europe. Hahahahah! Exactly. Ho back to Europe with your Maga hats, and see how that pans out.
Why are Ben Shapiro and Baby Hitler trending? I don’t have enough alcohol on hand to find out why.
Trump denying Nancy Pelosi her aircraft for a war zone trip means that Steve Mnuchin and his wife must’ve needed the plane to go to Cabo.
Why doesn’t SpeakerPelosi invite @AnnCoulter to give the state of the union?
I’d like to see a man remain in power as long as Theresa May has with the mess she has to deal with, and still be standing.

I love that the president, his family, and Fox News are scared of 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It’s nice to see Republicans get fucked over by a woman for a change.

Even though It’s been obvious for so long how corrupt trump is, learning everything he did is mind boggling. He truly believes he can just get away with whatever he feels like. What’s everyone else’s excuse? Talking to you, entire Republican Party.

Wouldn’t it be nice if Republicans realized why they are losing elections and actually changed their strategies and policies in favor of voters,  instead of ignoring them and  stealing ballots and purging voter rolls? You would do better off with a reality check than theft.
@dustyschmidt I accepted her loss and Democrats didn’t try to pretend it didn’t happen.
It really is amazing that Republicans are willing to cheat and steal elections and not even deny their behavior. They lose power in Wisconsin and are now fighting for the newly elected Democratic governor to have less power. I mean, honestly. You lost. Move the fuck over.

For a president and his base who hate foreigners, they surely seem okay with Russians and Saudi Arabians. What an incredible president you chose to elect. He stands for nothing but himself. And murder. And tax evasion and family separation. And assault.
I’d like to know what kind of noise cancelling head phones @IvankaTrump used during one of the 5 thousand times her father mentioned Hillary’s private email servers during his campaign. I’d like a pair for every time I hear him talk.
Let’s #EndGunViolenceTogether - go to https://t.co/SnexHBk0EY to send your Member of Congress a postcard demanding they take action on what 90% of Americans agree on: universal background checks. @TOMS  TOMS Hero Graphic.jpg
Oh, Ivanka! Happy thanksgiving, girl.
I’m not surprised Trump confused the name of Paradise, California. He’s all over the place. He doesn’t know whether The White House is the Kremlin, Ivanka is Melania, or Ben Carson is Dennis Rodman.
Fun ideas for Sunday are as follows: take an edible, and watch our predator in chief be interview by Chris Wallace. Look out for Wallace’s reaction when trump talks about raking bushes. Or take two edibles.
@FlaEd @GilCisnerosCA Well, we had some big wins. We flipped I think 5 just in California alone. Rohrbacher is out!! Steps
@Bootoomee @GilCisnerosCA That is a nice message to get! Thank you. America woke up, and so did millions of us.
@janendg2016 @GilCisnerosCA Isn’t it bizarre when we actually count all the votes rather than shut down the election before all absentees arrive?
Number 36 seat flipped. California! @GilCisnerosCA https://t.co/ge9SkA0vGR
Hahahahah https://t.co/IFiWWS7aen
Good to know, Republicans. https://t.co/PtZj9gN0wo
California really needs rain... For the fires and so Trump cancels his visit tomorrow.
Looks like someone is winning, and that someone is not named Donald Trump. Here’s what Californians are against: racism, babies in cages, guns in schools, churches, and nightclubs. Oh, yeah, and our planet. If that’s called being liberal, than yeah, we’re liberal. https://t.co/Xd9323PSs6

@AbideandConquer We need transitional leadership.
I agree with this. Support the women who deserve our support. Leader Pelosi got us here and knows her way in and around congress.

On nov. 27th, there is a runoff election and Mike Espy is the man. Please support @espyforsenate to get the right man in the senate for Mississippi. His opponent refuses to answer questions about lynching comment. Let’s move forward. Spread the word, NOVEMBER 27th! https://t.co/mySNKynbAW
Trump on people who vote twice: “Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again." Your son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was literally registered to vote as a woman.

Trump took a golf cart at the G7 Summit last year because he didn’t want to walk. Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke three ribs and she’s already back at work. One of them looks 85. One of them is 85.

There’s not one Republican who is ready to stand up to the NRA? Not one that thinks it makes sense to ban semi automatic weapons? To put the value of American lives above a check from the nra? Surely, you wanted to work in government to serve? To protect? How can you be so lost?
Oh, yeah!! Mississippi! Let’s spread this message. https://t.co/1N9jZCHVh4
Thousand Oaks is the 307th mass shooting in the U.S. this year. If that does not absolutely horrify you, then you need to take some time to yourself and think about why.  An armed police officer is dead, so that didn’t work. When are Republicans going to stand up against the NRA?
I watched what happened with @Acosta happen in real time yesterday, and that video is altered. Every reporter who has any shred of dignity should boycott covering the WH until you are all allowed in freely and equally. If you don’t stand up for one another, you will be next.
Any Georgia voter who cast a provisional ballot should contact 866-OUR-VOTE to immediately ensure your vote is counted. Every voter must be heard.

@SarcasticSpins1 Or the lens you see it through. You have a president who lies on camera daily and wants to take away your healthcare.

It is the responsibility of all our news groups to stop airing Trump’s rallies. These rallies are not news. They are inciting violence and hatred and have nothing to do with the truth or politics. Please take some responsibility and stop airing them. @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews
The silence from Republicans today speaks volumes about how they intend to protect the American people. They will come for you, too. They will rip apart our healthcare, rip apart families, and continue to lie, at any cost. To support a president who espouses violence is deadly.

@wpinksaw Well, we have to elect people who will propose that kind of legislation. That’s not a bad idea, but would never gain traction with republicans. They don’t denounce trump for anything he does. They don’t even care about his taxes
@bjswen_kc Really? Is that your response? Answer my question first?
@wpinksaw I don’t know. I don’t know how republicans can allow this to go on...
A man walks into a consulate. Never walks out. 15 Saudi men show up and he accidentally dies. The president of the United States gives them one month to come up with a reason. Trump supporters- how can you vote for a president who allows this?
We have to support our democratic candidates running for senate if we want to stop Trumo and his horrifying agenda. @kyrstensinema @SenatorMenendez @BetoORourke @RosenforNevada a vote for a Republican is a vote for Trump. Please let’s stick together and vote for Democrats. https://t.co/qg6z5sLqak

Our president is limiting a scope into the sexual assault allegations of a woman. He bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. He hates women. Just look at the women who support him who stand by and do nothing when he attacks women over and over again. Let’s vote this pussy out. https://t.co/OEHFVYepZN
Beto O’Rourke had 55,000 people at his last rally. Did you hear that @TedCruz? Ted Cruz can’t even get 55,000 people to like one of his tweets.

Last week @emilyslist endorsed 2 more women in Texas and Arizona. @AnitaMalik in #AZ06 and @janasanchez in #TX06, two fantastic pro-choice Democratic women whose voices we need in Congress! #ElectWomen
If you live in the state of Georgia, it’s time to make history. Vote @staceyabrams for Governor and say no to bigotry, racism, and the marginalization of all minorities. America is better than this, and this is one of the most important governor races this election cycle. https://t.co/AbR2MV1bHk

Kavanaugh continues to deny sexual misconduct accusations, which shouldn’t be a surprise because his calendar keeps reminding him to lie under oath.
The Republican Party doesn’t believe sexual assault accusers, casts them all as liars. They deny sexual assault and if you get pregnant from that assault, you should also be denied a choice to decide what to do with your body, for the second time. Goodfuckingluckinnovemeber
@margare1836496 @PiperPerabo You should listen to survivors a little more before you accuse their memories from 35 years ago being false. I remember plenty from 35 years ago. The point is to listen.

Bill Cosby is set to serve 3 to 10 years in prison, but when he’s released he’s expected to be nominated to the Supreme Court.
Brett Kavanaugh said he was a virgin in high school and for many years after. I guess it took him that long to find someone who would actually consent.

@KeKneeC @SenatorMenendez The Republican candidate is a trump supporter. Period. We need democrats in senate who have strong voting records. Look it up. He was never found guilty, but he is better than his opponent.
@johnboydillon @SenatorMenendez No, take a look at his opponent and decide who will be best at protecting women’s rights, gun reform, and protecting our environment. He wasn’t convicted of anything and his opponent ran a pharmaceutical company.
@WFPORG @SenatorMenendez Awesome, girls!
Thank you ladies, for endorsing the candidate who has always voted to protect and advance women’s rights. A Republican is a trump supporter. We are not lining in  a tome where we can trust any Republican to hold trump to fire. #babiesincages #gunsinschool= Republican values https://t.co/NnXpdcZ2jP
@JR_OHara @SenatorMenendez Were there any women that accused bob menendez of attempted rape? Or pulling his dick out a party? No
@ksondere @SenatorMenendez Yes. Republican have really demonstrated how much they value Americans by giving tax cuts to the rich and rolling back any venvirbomental protections, oh, and the latest, allowing asbestos to be used again. After 50 years of it being banned, because it causes cancer
@jeremiahhouse08 @SenatorMenendez No, I actually look into the candidates and then the races. His opponent is a trump supporter and owned a pharmaceutical company. When the dems run a great candidate against menendez, I will get behind that person. This is the situation we are in. Not voting at all is not right.
@t_shirkman @SenatorMenendez We are talking about sexual assault. I am not a huge fan of bob menendez, but it is a matter of holding trump accountable which senator Repubs are NOT doing, or electing a flawed candidate. Hugin also owned a pharmaceutical candidate. Period
@ksondere @SenatorMenendez Going out way isn’t the way I would describe a lunatic at the White House who is so unhinged there are multiple meetings a day about how to hide it.
@jeremiahhouse08 @SenatorMenendez I’m for whoever has a close race and I’m forever who is supportive of women’s rights. Look at menendez’ record. And then look at republicans.
@t_shirkman @SenatorMenendez Get a grip on reality. Bob Menendez at least is being held accountable daily. If you think another Republican senator is going to be good, please go vote for them.
@JERSEYNICKS @SenatorMenendez Yes, pumpkin. Vote for the Republican and allow him to back all of trump’s awful poliicies that scorch our earth, our allies, and roll back women’s rights, pumpkin.
@ejroberts11 @SenatorMenendez A vote for a third party is what got us to DONALD trump. We have to focus o  this resistance and win a majority in the senate, otherwise it is hell for another 4 years.
@lacrossesdhb I feel the same way. We can get a new candidate next time.
@unclewho @SenatorMenendez Menendez was never convicted of any charges. Period. He was never  accused of rape. Period.
I believe Deborah Ramirez. I do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh kept a calendar of parties he attended when he was 17. And if he did, he certainly did not write down the date he “thrusted his penis” in someone’s face.
We are living in a time where many candidates are flawed. Today, now more than ever, it is a choice between trump backed candidates, and Democrats who have had controversy surrounding certain investigations, even though not found guilty. We must support @SenatorMenendez in NJ.
I just woke up, looked at the news, popped a Xanax and am going back to bed. Here’s to hoping that when I wake up trump has been removed by the 25th amendment. It will certainly be my in my dreams. Thank you to all my fellow patriots who are as outraged as I am and keep me going.

@niacovella @SenatorMenendez @BobMenendezNJ He was acquitted and found not guilty. Hugin is a nightmare. Vote republican and you are voting for Russia and trump.

@mschultz007 @emilyslist @RosenforNevada @kyrstensinema Schumer and Pelosi want to usher in a new era as much as anyone. Do not vote against a party because you don’t like their current leaders. You want to vote for a trump supporter, go ahead.
@Glennwinning2 @Lina4HC @LLN_USA Republicans do nothing for Latinos. They have no special interest group donors that have your best interest. So, voting of one is continuing to vote against your best interest. Health care, increased minimum wage, and humane immigration reform are not Republican platforms.

@niacovella @SenatorMenendez @BobMenendezNJ Republicans have had no check on trump. Period. We need democrats.
@Insomania4Ever @SenatorMenendez It’s a choice between 2 candidates. One is worse than the other, by a lot.
This is our candidate for senatorial race in New Jersey.

'This guy who's going to be our Supreme Court justice ... and he better be our Supreme Court judge, he's a perfect candidate. And what do they say? 'Well, in high school you did this.' High school? Give me a break.'" L.A. Times from @DanaRohrabacher VOTE FOR @HarleyRouda on NOV6
Apparently a third of Ben Carson’s appointees have no housing experience, but every single one of them have been shown an episode of House Hunters.
An audit has shown the NRA is in the red for second straight year. The audit also found that the NRA spent over $50 million supporting Trump &amp; other Republicans. Imagine if they cared as much about the people who have lost their lives to guns than the Republicans who own them.
Here we go, Republicans. What now? https://t.co/VUy0lELPvb
One known sexual predator on the Supreme Court isn’t enough for Republicans. They want two. The president bragging about sexual assault isn’t an issue for them either. They have no regard for women. No regard for their daughters or wives.

Regarding the anonymous op-ed writer, Kellyanne Conway said “cowards are like criminals — they eventually suss out themselves.” Who could she be talking about? Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, George Papadopolous, Michael Flynn, @DonaldJTrumpJr such a medley!
.@emilyslist endorsed two more pro-choice Democratic women today! @AyannaPressley, who won their 2015 Rising Star Award, could be the first African American woman to represent Massachusetts in Congress. @LoriUSCongress is running for a must-hold seat. Let's help elect them.

We will next be starting a campaign to fund @lisamurkowski opponent if she doesn’t have the decency to vote no on Kavanaugh. You are a woman. Act like it. https://t.co/wlw3DKvJFs
I can’t wait until they add the Republican Party of 2016 as an example of hypocrisy next to the definition of the word. They hear him lie every day and do nothing. They have no right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice under these circumstances. No decency whatsoever.
Let’s get to a million and serve up murkowski an opponent as well. No one with a conscience for the future of women can get away with voting yes on Kavanaugh. https://t.co/TBpngxshsP

Guys- this campaign was supposed to raise 200k, and now we are at 645k. Let’s show Susan Collins we are not backing down. Woo-hoo https://t.co/48yz1rz97Q
Enough of the bullshit. Kavanaugh's made it clear that he thinks the Supreme Court can overturn #RoevWade. Our lives &amp; health are at risk, &amp; none of this will change unless we elect even more pro-choice Democratic women to Congress. https://t.co/0BpMpgNK7K https://t.co/HF58GOtAc4
Trump has called on the Justice Dept to investigate the anonymous NY Times op-ed writer over “security concerns.” While they’re at it, they should also investigate why Trump can’t say the word “anonymous.”

It would be nice to have a president who thinks before they speak, who brings people together instead of dividing them, who values children’s lives and the institution of families—by not ever tearing them apart. A president who isnt a bully and a racist. A person with dignity.

Los Angeles is going to be naming a street after Barack Obama and you can guarantee I am going to celebrate by driving down it topless.  Guess who will never have a street named after him? Starts with a “T.” Well, maybe a dirt road back to the past.
Trump said Jeff Sessions’ job is safe until at least the midterms. But after that, it’s going to be lots of free time for Jeff Sessions and Ted Cruz to play basketball.

“Monkey this up,” is not a phrase anyone uses. Unless they are applying for a membership to MAR-O-Lago. The people who keep defending this racist president and his cohorts will be sorry when they have to explain to their mixed gay children what they did.
The Texas GOP can share all the mugshots they want,  I’d rather have a someone who got a DUI twenty years ago, than someone who defiles his country and state daily, by voting for tax cuts for the wealthy and gutting healthcare for his voters. Vote for @BetoORourke in November.
Congrats to everyone who was unblocked by Donald Trump on Twitter. If you are wondering what you missed, just imagine a senile, old man holding up a racist sign, but instead of a sign it’s a tweet and instead of just any man, it’s our Republican President.
The thing about democracy is, it only works if WE work it. So, me and a few twitter friends have created something to help us call our Senators. Will you call yours now? Tell them: "A yes vote on Kavanaugh is a vote to criminalize abortion." Simple as that.https://t.co/H1m37GQExK

For every idiot who comments that you can’t vote for women just because they are women, there is a man in office who’s abused his right to serve—and that position should be given to someone new. Since women have never had parity in serving, I’d say it’s time to give that a shot.

Senator @ChuckGrassley’s Judiciary Committee meets this morning. There's only one thing they need to discuss: Why have the standards suddenly changed for requesting the records of Supreme Court nominees? And #WhatAreTheyHiding in those documents? #ReleaseTheRecords
Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that former CIA Director John Brennan would no longer have access to classified information due to "erratic conduct and behavior." Ummmm...

@jbarnrealty Yeah, well if women’s rights don’t matter to you, then yes. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
The hypocrisy in this administration and among Republicans is startling, and basically them saying they are going to turn back women’s rights by 50 years. Who’s next? Well, black people, gay people, any minority, and when they’re done there, it will be your rights. https://t.co/NR3L5p8I8G

Of the 25% of Brett Kavanaugh's White House records requested by Senate Judicial Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, just .1% have been released to the public. We need to put pressure on any senator waffling on Brett Kavanaugh.  @SenateGOP: @lisamurkowski (AK),

The Republican Party is hiding over a MILLION pages of Brett Kavanaugh's record. (Most of it is from when he served in George W. Bush's White House.)  What are you hiding, @ChuckGrassley?  The American people deserve to know.

Trump claimed that Americans need photo ID to buy groceries. I guess that’s the kind of logic you develop when the only thing you’re used to buying is the silence of the women you had affairs with.
Trump believes that people are voting illegally, but also wants to make sure that all American citizens of color who are legally voting should have their votes suppressed. That’s quite a policy.

Can @Twitter just remove Trump’s account, already? No leader of any country should be tweeting threats to people and other countries. That would actually force him to talk more and explain policies and answer questions on tape, and we all know how that goes.

@nicolenovak @emilyslist @gretchenwhitmer @AbdulElSayed Whitmer has a stronger chance of winning the general election. All branches of government are Republican in Michigan. If he wins, i will support him in the general, but she has a better shot at winning.
@aubrey_kapcsos @emilyslist Thank you!
@nicolenovak @emilyslist @gretchenwhitmer @AbdulElSayed I did check him out and Whitmer has a much better chance of winning the general election. She is running moderately because in Michigan, all 3 branches are Republican, and they are more likely to vote for moderate Democrats. Each state is deferent

Things I’ve learned so far this Friday: Michael Cohen has a tape of Trump talking about paying off his affairs, Roseanne is still racist, and Whoopi Goldberg deserves another Oscar for saying “fuck you” to Jeanine Pirro.
Now, trump wants to make changes to the Endangered Species Act—why is every choice they make so villainous—from allowing hibernating bear cubs and baby wolves to be hunted to getting rid of environmental protections for clean water and air. Pure evil.
How is it not our right to know what happened when trump and Putin were alone? How do we not know they were planning on how to hack the midterms? Because trump said that he reprimanded Putin in private? That’s about as believeable as me reprimanding @RoundaRousey in a ring.
Trump supporters: are you okay with him considering offering up American diplomats to Russia? That is acting in the best interest of America? He said he thought it was “an incredible offer”. Until he says that he meant to say, “it wasn’t an incredible opportunity.” America 1st?

@lesleyrosem @realDonaldTrump With trumps campaign. Wake up. We can not have Russia controlling our president. If trump weren’t in his pocket, why would he kiss his ass like this?
@april_s22 @realDonaldTrump He’ll probably give Putin a blow job.
@RussiaTroll @realDonaldTrump You should start drinking, because our president has been compromised by Putin’s, who hates America. If that doesn’t bother you, than you don’t care about your country.
@cindygirl3 @realDonaldTrump Well, because 1) he refuses to admit that Russia did anything 2)because he continues to kiss Putin’s ass and 3) with that level of interference, you can bet your bottom dollar that there was help from trump’s campaign. Russia is our enemy. Putin hates America. Trump loves Putin.
@trippiest1 Makes me sick, too.
@OscarCos He’s always been so respectful of them, though.

@b_neis_n_wander You should check the sources that you are getting news from. What about the children who are actually getting ripped from their parents? Hello?
@Trekwolf164 Inmates because they were trying to escape gangs in their country? Your position requires an understanding of where and what these desperate people are running from. People should never be separated from small children. They can be held in detainment centers with their kids.

Our president has asked for legal permission to continue separating children from parents. After he said it was the Democrats fault. Any person who stands next to him or any sort of judicial nominee he sanctions is also okay with children being torn from their parents.

@elisabethlehem @IronStache Actually, the majority of people I support have won their primaries or general elections. I do a lot of work when supporting a candidate. You’re right. He fell on hard times, lost his job, had cancer, and wasn’t able to pay his child support. And then he did. That’s a real person
@MichaelRabb @IronStache At least I’m making the time and effort to meet these candidates. Probably, because I give a shit.
@TTFowl1966 @IronStache How many candidates have you met?
@catlady2099 @IronStache There are many male candidates and reps I support. Women are underrepresented in Congress and it is my priority to help change that this year. There is nothing wrong with wanting parity and equality.
@Castlesuzanne @WhitfordBradley @IronStache Thank you for your support!
@Truggs4 @IronStache Because lots of the candidates I support have won their primaries and won, period. That’s why. Because I want to make this country a better place and I don’t sit online and troll people I don’t know.

This is the man for Wisconsin.

@brianpcook @b_neis_n_wander I’m pissed Obama didn’t do more, but he’s gone now, and the person in charge of setting hangs straight with Russia keeps repeating he has no interest in doing so. This concerns me greatly. Not you? You’re ok with them actively trying to interfere th our next election also?
@kiewtip He is empowering our police officers throughout the country to racially profile people. He has never once said anything against it, and in fact, has encourage our officers to be more physically abusive switch “suspected” perps. Did you miss that rally?

@DrTroy357 But, they both are so clearly manipulating trump. Do you not think that? He doesn’t need to kiss their ass. Kim jong is still developing nuclear weapons. There are photos.
@b_neis_n_wander Because they hacked into our elections? Because they poison people? Because Putin spies on all Americans when they are over and blackmails them? Because they hijacked Crimea?
Can any of his supporters explain to me why you are okay with Trump constantly kissing Putin’s ass? We know that he tampered with our election and with Brexit. Do you not believe that? I know maybe I’m being naive, but Putin is evil and hates America. Please explain to me.

I can’t wait until there’s (more) irrefutable proof that trump has cheated, scammed the IRS, and colluded,—and the Paul Ryan’s and Mitch McConnell’s of Congress start to distance themselves from trump the way he distances himself from Manafort, Flynn, &amp; papadoplofuck. Get ready.
@Rosie @NicolleDWallace Yeah, she’s awesome.
This is the man who won his primary for  #CA49 and will flip this seat blue.  He is the kind of candidate I am proud to get behind so that we get rid of these Republicans who allow Trump to subvert the entire Republican Party. https://t.co/TFsFXcuFTU
Hey syphilis brain. It’s nice you have such sympathy for high level criminals, yet not for kids being ripped from their parents—by the thousands, now. This is your policy. The Trump policy. Not democrats. Everything you say is a lie. Your skin color is even a lie. Your hair. https://t.co/jZQPJ6rXcF

Trump doesn’t need notes from his meeting with Kim Jong Un because he has “one of the great memories of all time.” Except when he forgets the words to the National Anthem… or who Frederick Douglass is…or Stormy Daniels...or that he’s married.

State &amp; Local: 31 of our state and local candidates won last night, including Lauren Arthur (MO-SD17), who won her red-to-blue special election, and Deidre DeJear who, if elected, would be Iowa's first black statewide elected official as secretary of state. @emilyslist

@matthewamiller @MalcolmNance Why, though? Paul Ryan and all the rest of repubs who are resigning and not doing that? I think gowdy is in deep with Russia and trying to get out. These other repubs are waiting to all get rewarded by the big corps they gifted with the tax bill. They don’t care.

@macaulaytrollki And that precludes them from their 1st amendment right which trump abuses every single day? not have an opinion because you’re successful?
@Bilbo_Swagginz2 @mortyl Live in denial and watch your kids grow up without the rights you’ve become so used to having. It’s a take-down if democracy. Perhaps, that is your wish.
@nik_nak907 The very reason our soldiers fought for us was to defend freedom of speech. If that is quelled, then what did they fight for? No company or corporation should dictate how you express yourself, as long as it is in a non-violent way.
@MollyErinLarsen @chamoniIIe @HairFairyNina Wrong. The first amendment is freedom of speech, no matter who the employer. This is going back in time.
@HairFairyNina @chamoniIIe No. This is free speech, where you are allowed to work for an employer who holds different beliefs than you do—yet you are allowed to disagree based on respect for the 1st amendment. Jobs don’t dictate your right—clearly with our president abusing his every single day.

@LynusCantwell @Lina4HC @ginaortizjones @LUnderwood630 Well, If you like being lied to every day by the man running our country, then you should.
Trump decides to overrule our security concerns with Chinese firm ZTE and it just happens to coincide with China agreeing to invest $500K in a new Trump resort in Indonesia. Where is #congressionaloversight https://t.co/20MN2GDQU5
@cantedcat Refer them to Molly.
Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves. They created 3 branches of government to make sure there was oversight. This Republican congress instead plays deaf, blind, and mute while a corrupt megalomaniac sells our country to the highest bidder. This is how democracy dies.
Had a fundraiser last night at my house for these three very qualified women of color. The world is getting browner and gayer and we need candidates who represent the future, not the past. @Lina4HC @ginaortizjones @LUnderwood630 pls support and donate if you are able. https://t.co/6YOeYXh4iB
@tbaxt @countable No, I support men too, but we need more women in office, since they are more level headed and actually give a shit about the future of our children.
A lot of women won last night! We have a wave coming. A wave of wowen. You can see all the candidates I support on my @countable or Facebook page. I’m on it, and I do my research. We need women and people of color to represent the next generation. Not more 70 year old white men.
@laurenduca That should be the elixir for everything: shrimp cocktail
@lcarousel22 Because one isn’t in this country and one is trying to get a job. I never sexually assaulted anyone. You sound like that’s not a big deal, though.
I just read that Bill O’Reilly is in talks to return to cable news...with his EP, Bill Cosby? How about—I don’t think so, buddy. Please RT to prevent this man getting rewarded once again after sexually assaulting women and denying it over and over again.
Nikki Haley just blamed Hamas for getting her Starbucks order wrong.  And then @kellysadler45 said that group is dying out, anyway.
now the bibi craizies are running the show, unchecked and will effectively turn gaza and the left bank into starvation camps or mental asylums, if not already and bomb iran into submission... there will be a religious term for this. i think the evangelicals call it the rapture.
@barrycunningham No weapons to match semi-automatic rifles. That person should die for that?
@ytspar @joshdcaplan Me too
It would be like Hitler saying Auschwitz is all about HELPING the Jews stay warm. @nikkihaley
Nikki Haley is on tv talking about Hamas being responsible for the Palestinians protesting yesterday. These people had no weapons. They had tires to burn. There was a dead baby. While Netanyahu celebrates.
This is worth watching. https://t.co/nONUUfjA0K

I'm coming to Minnesota's State Theater for a fun night chatting with @janashortal on Tuesday, June 5th. Tickets available here: https://t.co/J5jTF5790D https://t.co/OzAKAL0wcc
Last week, @emilyslist endorsed over 20 pro-choice Dem women for state &amp; local office. They endorsed @ErinCollier2018 for #NY19. And all TWENTY of their candidates with primary elections on Tuesday won! Momentum for women candidates keeps on building, and in Nov, they'll win big.
@JSiddell Hey buddy, I hate to break it to you, but there have been over 20 indictments related to the investigation. You can keep pretending this has nothing to do with Russia, but you’re delusional. Trump is a crook and a liar.
@MelissaRuthven1 That’s not helpful to you or the people you care about.
@lorlamartin Yeah, that’s me. Clueless.
@lorlamartin I do my due diligence on every candidate I support. I am not a politician.
If the WH doesn’t have the decency to for @kellysadler45, then @kellysadler45 should have the decency to resign. Your resignation would equal an apology, since you already blew that. This kind of talk isn’t acceptable about anyone’s father or husband, never mind American hero.
I’m glad Ivanka and Jared could take time away from their busy schedules of not being qualified to represent the US to go represent the US, and celebrate moving the capital in exchange for the adelson’s donations, while 50+ Palestinians have been killed.
This is the woman running in my home district of New Jersey. Pls make sure you are all registered to vote. We are stronger than Russia, if we all show up to the polls. Sorry for my earlier misspellings; sometimes when I wake up, I have donald trump fingers. https://t.co/EQ4VMVYJSN

Happy Mother’s Day to all the women in the world who have children close and far.  I don’t know how you do it, but celebrate yourselves today. Bam! 💜💜💜

If the WH doesn’t fire @kellysadler45  then at least have the right mind to step down. You did an awful thing, and if you don’t have the decency to resign, it will be the only thing you are remembered for.
@StavisDavid Actually, I’m from New Jersey.
This administration attacks American values every day. The world is getting browner and gayer, so it’s in everyone’s best interest to hop on board and show a little love and compassion to those less fortunate. Black, white, brown. Stand for something. Racism is hate. https://t.co/66gnP2KErf
We need more people of color and women in Congress. This men are disgraceful. https://t.co/p1ultEsRZM
And more important, @MikePenceVP what kind of patriot r u that you don’t care about all the money your president’s personal attorney was taking from all these parties, including Russia. Why don’t U care? U should be calling for him to resign unless you too, are in bed w/ Russia.
Why on earth would we be wrapping up this investigation when we just found out that your president’s personal attorneys is taking money from Russia? Sounds like the investigation is right on track @MikePenceVP
Companies like this will only respond to pressure by us. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/JrSZwzR5AP
Mike Pence said it’s time to “wrap up” the Mueller investigation. Mainly because he’s ready to be president.
No shit. https://t.co/58nlj7xmzu
SHELDON ADELSON has cut a $30 million to the House GOP-leadership aligned Congressional Leadership Fund. We have got to elect candidates who want to take money out of politics. This is buying your way into government, and has to stop. We need to overturn Citizens United.
This is a woman who is running against 6 men in NY state and could use our help until we elect candidates who run on overturning Citizens United. Until we elect candidates who want publicly funded elections, we have to work to get the right people elected. https://t.co/m9DOMMRsFw
I’m pretty sure someone who was caught on tape bragging about grabbing women by the pussy isn’t going to get a Nobel Peace Prize. What a fucking idiot.

I feel the same way about @SarahHuckabee’s daily press briefings as I do about watching—I Didn’t Know I was Pregnant. Excited.
@BreakingNLive Give those people assault rifles and they kill. Ban assault rifles and they don’t. Why would you support assault rifles? Why is that necessary? I’m not talking about handguns for the 2nd amendment, which by the way was written before assault weapons
@SdotFLOSS So are children!
@littlepeep09 My armed guards aren’t killing children and don’t have semi automatic weapons.
@fiveironheart Part of being safe In schools and public is not to allow assault weapons that can kill multiple people in seconds. Why on earth to we need assauly weapons? Keep your handguns and rifles.
That’s not going to happen because of your sham of a presidency and your lack or anything related to decency or morality. Republicans are against abortions but not against children who are ALIVE being safe in schools? Get your priorities in order. We are. https://t.co/JjvpnVNXjL
@Steelernaught68 It’s “tear.” Love you!
@RossFletcher76 We do the same. We’re not fucking around this November. Please do everything you can. 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
@historBilia Sing it, sister!
@James87060132 @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY Only if you’re sexist.
@KCGreen17 @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY Oh, we’re gonna do it.
@StellaUmbrella8 @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY @MikieSherrill is awesome and will win!
@Ashrice620 @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY Thank you for saying that.
@npr40 @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY Yes, I asked them.
@BadAndy782 @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY I’m saying that these are qualified women who have served our country. There are plenty of men I support too. It’s really annoying to have to explain that. I do my research and I support women.
@Amanda_Kerri @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY @ElysabethBritt Will add her to my list.
These 5 female VETERAN badasses R running 4 Congress this year throughout our country. Pls find out more and help spread the word. Some of these women face primaries coming up &amp; could use our support.  @ginaortizjones @HoulahanForPa @MikieSherrill @ElissaSlotkin @AmyMcGrathKY https://t.co/DA38g6XB7e
We can fix this country; we just can’t be shy about it. Donate, tweet, turn Facebook into an American ally, and be loud and bold. We have to do this, but we have to do it together.
@pmg28283798 @ErinCollier2018 Go to her Twitter and I’m sure there’s a link. Sorry, I isn’t post one.
@pnaq1120 That doesn’t sound racist at all. Shot 20 times? What purpose does that serve?
@honestlyhafsa I couldn’t survive on that salary and no one would elect me, but I am doing everything in my power to make a difference in November.
@uberjosephB @realDonaldTrump To try and help save democracy. But, that’s just me.
@THOMASBMALONE Those are all elections. We elect people who make the rules and in many states, we elect judges. We need to pay attention to all races.
@amore_sun Your lives do matter and the majority of white people in this country understand that. I am disgusted and intend to do something about it.
@MediaSharkLLC @ErinCollier2018 Deal.
@FatNancy71 @ErinCollier2018 Duh
@islasislasc @ErinCollier2018 I’m in. It’s going to happen

@nwarikoo @ShaunKing Fuck mitt Romney
@krassenstein @DonCheadle Yeah!
I don’t want to live in a country where police officers pay no price for shooting innocent black men and women. It is imperative that we look at all of our local elections to find candidates who represent equality and will punish people in positions of power who abuse it.
A new poll says that Americans now view the Parkland students more favorably than the NRA. Sounds like the NRA is going to need some CPR to resuscitate their popularity. Maybe Rick Santorum can help.
Mike Screnock was arrested twice for blocking women trying to go to abortion clinics. Now he wants to be a rubber stamp for Scott Walker's anti-choice policies on WI's Supreme Court. Help now to stop him. https://t.co/yk9yFOsbcH

@delta2nite Air, you tweet that at me every day. I was the one who shared that video I  the first place on my tv show, so thank you for watching.
@MikeMason830 Thank you! 💜
I’m ready to start dating stormy Daniels’ attorney.
Five amazing @emilyslist candidates to highlight. This week, they endorsed @RachelReddick, @wildforcongress, and @maurasullivan for Congress. And @BetsyforIL and @LUnderwood630 won their primaries! Congrats ladies, keep kicking ass!
Trump reportedly followed CNN this morning on Twitter, then quickly unfollowed them. Someone must’ve told him that CNN reminded them of Ivanka.
One of my favorite people, especially on twitter. @SarahKSilverman she taught me to be loud, proud, and that being a “celebrity,” Doesn’t preclude you from having an opinion or being a citizen. Love her bad💛 https://t.co/HykdciwePO
Another law we should be looking to overturn with the new Congress we elect in November midterms. Overturn this absolute bullshit. https://t.co/37RHIdwVt5
The three senators that would she focus on replacing. @marcorubio @tedcruz @ChuckGrassley then we win back the senate and not just the house. Fuck these guys. Check my Facebook for all the candidates I’m supporting.
I am more optimistic than ever about our future because these kids will be voting and they will be in charge. #MarchForOurLives sign #Midterms2018 we make sure the NRA doesn’t get to kill our kids. https://t.co/HUn0kmTszz
@delascordo Why are you following me?
The former Playboy model who alleges she had an affair with Trump said he told her she was “beautiful” like Ivanka. And then he asked her if she wanted to be the new National Security Advisor
This is what my dog thinks of this administration. #timesup https://t.co/2AllZgWR3v
@kumailn We just do.
Anyone who uses the word “believe” 8 times in one comment is obviously lying. @realDonaldTrump fattyfattytwobyfour
Unity is a two way street. Encouraging to see the @DCCC finally endorsing a candidate who supports #MedicareForAll. @IronStache is the progressive we need to get Paul Ryan out. https://t.co/lB1btv8nro
@JoyAnnReid I can’t believe DONALD trump jr had an affair. It just doesn’t add up.
It would be really fun to find out all these leaks are coming from John Kelly, himself. That would explain his exasperation with the leaker, and not the substance of the leaks themselves.
@BuzzFeed What...a beautiful love story
So far there are 19 women who claim they’ve had affairs or accuse Trump of unwanted advances. It’s good to know that when he’s done being president he’ll have a job waiting for him at Fox News.
And what will trump do when Putin poisons an American on American soil? And what will John Kelly do? And what will republicans do?
JOHN Kelly is livid about the leaks? What about being livid that trump congratulations a dictator who poisons our closest ally’s citizens? Is anyone pissed at that? Whoever is responsible for this leak is trying to warn our country that we have a compromised lunatic in the oval.
The @AMarch4OurLives gun safety marches will be all over America on the 24th. If you want to march and make a difference, volunteer with @HeadCountOrg to register voters. Sign up here: https://t.co/uA0SoQMcGx  #MarchForOurLives

Don’t worry, Ted. You’re going to have plenty of time to like those porn tweets when you’re out of a job in November. In other news, you know who’s not sitting around avoiding Texans while looking at porn? @BetoORourke https://t.co/7Vr6SNnqfW
@mcotteri @ShaunKing @RealJusticePAC We just need 200 more of these guys
@GABassAuthor I’ll like it for you!
@StormyDaniels Go, girl.
Paul Ryan said he’s been assured that Mueller will not be fired, saying “we have a justice system, and no one is above that justice system.” Except Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Jeff Sessions… I’d keep going but I have pilates in an hour.
Guess who else was in bed with Cambridge Analytica? @tedcruz https://t.co/q0VM1oqVeY
Great, then he should have no issue when this happens. https://t.co/ar3Er96JOz
@MikeMason830 No, the president is the last person who should have a twitter account.
We should all contemplate this. We need our twitter and Facebook to spread positive information, but at what cost? I am interested in hearing others opinions.  https://t.co/6kaEMwW30U

@jrand260 That’s weird. I seem to have a lot of followers.
@MANLIFESTOUGH @BetoORourke You know it’s not? Ted Cruz or DONALD trump.
The president has stated there is “no collusion.” This is the defense of his Republican defenders. That’s not a defense for a man who lies multiple times a day. If he’s talking, he’s lying.
Here’s another Texan candidate @juliejohnsonTX to look out for and support! https://t.co/1bvT3hPUuC
I got to hear @BetoORourke speak last night and it was great to hear a candidate who cares about working families, women, immigrantion, and all while not taking money from corporate behemoths. We need elected officials who are not for sale. Go, Texas. Go, @BetoORourke
Staffers were shocked that Kelly revealed to reporters that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, during a diplomatic swing through Africa, was suffering from a stomach bug and was using a toilet when Kelly told him to cut the trip short and return to Washington. -Politico
@thehill More great news.
@DuaneBrinson4 @karamfoundation Right.
@nurse22 @karamfoundation Any donation is so appreciated. Thank you!
@peyton530 @jdo3 Exactly. Thank you.

@sestienstra @karamfoundation Thank you!! 💜💜
@PaulFrancisobr2 @karamfoundation It’s sickening. All of it.
@dmic12 @karamfoundation Thank you. It feels so good to help.
@dmic12 @karamfoundation Thanks, buddy
@JesseRapke @karamfoundation Maybe you should.
@Sunshineelisee1 @karamfoundation You can find refugee families near you and go bring them food or a cake or help them learn English. Not just Syrian refugees- all refugees. See if there are refugee families in your area. easy to google. Thanks for caring
Every single man who works with Trump looks like they’ve sexually assaulted a woman. Even the women who stand by him look like that, too. https://t.co/mJJ8POwptG
I know we have a lot of issues to deal with in our own country, but this is an image of a child being evacuated in Syria.

Democratic billionaires- we need you to illustrate what this 30 million dollar military parade would be better spent on. That, and the fact that the person who requested it dodged the draft however many times because of “bone spurs.” Is that a hair-related malady? Fuck
Steve Mnuchin's punishment for spending $1million of taxpayer dollars on military flights should be that moving forward the only way he can travel is if it’s on United.
This is another candidate I’m excited about in California. Women are going to win so much, we’re going to get sick and tired of winning! https://t.co/OqQq1xe7lj

Rex Tillerson actually remained in his job for 14 months. Someone should test Betsy DeVos and see if she can figure out how many Scaramucci’s that is.
So, Rex Tillerson acknowledges Russia isn’t our friend and poisoned the latest father/daughter in Russia, and then he’s replaced. I wonder why? Wake up, Americans who still support Trump. You are Russian now. Taking orders from a foreign enemy is treason.
We’ve had a bunch of dark days since dipsy doodle has been elected, but we have also had many bright spots on days of special elections, and here’s to hoping today, Pennsylvanians say no to Russia and say no to Trump. Go, @ConorLambPA We Want America Back

I’m very curious to see how Trump and Kim Jong Un’s first date goes. I just hope this time Trump knows that if he launches his missile, he needs to remember to sign the NDA.

@JewBoyNation That’s probably correct.
@MorganMavity @HillaryClinton You mean, what your friend @realDonaldTrump does on a daily basis with Russia? I’m not worried about Hillary Clinton. I’m worried about the safety of our children and Russia.
I think it might behoove our elected officials in the congress and the senate to watch this season of HOMELAND and remind yourself that  that is fiction and this is reality.
To all the students in Florida. Do not let anyone stop you. We are with you and we will support you and you are right and you deserve to be heard. Florida Republicans will go down as a stain on American history. You are all sanctioning mass murders. For money.

Mental health issues. You know who is going to have mental health issues? Every person who witnesses a massacre and relentless gunfire. Every child who sees other children murdered in a fucking classroom. Every teacher. Every parent. #GunReformNow
Interesting that the same group of people who are against ending a fetus’ life in a womb are the same people who think little children getting shot at school, is perfectly fine and do nothing to stop that.
We will always have mentally disturbed people, especially now that one sits in the Oval Office. Better not to have guns for them to use, since you are also cutting funds for the mentally disabled. Do something decent while you are in office. Anything. https://t.co/AVDe3HmvyF

Yeah, gee. I wonder why? You allow a chemical that enlarges children’s brains to be used in fertilizer—Because that company donated a million dollars to trump-a product that was banned by Obama. Killing our children for money. Guns, pesticides, whatever. More money https://t.co/Xx84X0iRIz
Exactly. https://t.co/vjzUyCDkBo
@RealBlueBets Yes, and it was republicans who blocked any gun reform. Are you arguing for this to go on, because without reform, we have a shooting every two days.
We have to elect candidates that are not funded by the NRA in November. We have an opportunity to elect candidates who won’t allow kids to go to school and get shot. It is disgusting how many times this has happened and Republicans do nothing. You all have blood on your hands.

There is something seriously wrong with the Republican Party to allow Trump to get away with driving James Comey and Andrew McCabe out of the FBI. They have all been infiltrated by the Russians. We are going to have to majorly protest and take to the streets. Merry Xmas eve, all.
Of course @realDonaldTrump said Haitians have AIDS. That’s exactly something he would say. Why even bother refuting it? Republicans don’t care what he does. If he killed someone on 5th Avenue, Republicans would say the person had it coming. They all belong in jail.

Just evacuated my house. It’s like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire. Literally and figuratively. Stay safe everyone. Dark times.
mental health experts predicted that once mueller closes in, trump will deflect with wars. Anything to distract people from the election he won because of Russia. And now, it’s happening. He’s starting wars.
“Tough on crime” is an interesting stance coming from the biggest criminal we know. “Tough on crime”  means, let’s make sure we get all the brown people. We have a criminal in the WH who is lining his pockets with our fears.
I really wish mainstream media would stop talking about the possibility that trump can fire mueller. Stop talking about it as if it’s a normal thing. We know he spends his days watching these shows and in his mind, you’re giving him license to do it. All hell would break loose.
@PandaChronic I don’t feed the rich. I take my own money and feed the less fortunate. Silencers silence Guns. If they didn’t do anything, they wouldn’t be for sale. The laws have been weakened to allow mentally ill easier access to guns. These are facts.
This is what the Republican Party stands for: NO HEALTH CARE, TAX THE POOR, FEED THE RICH, GIVE MENTALLY DISABLED ACCESS TO GUNS, ALLOW GUN SILENCERS, and the latest new edition: SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. Grab an adult or a minor, just make sure she’s a she.
Yes, that’s right. We need a criminal to stop crime. I wonder how he’ll handle other sex offenders, or maybe we just only elect sex offenders to run this country and you can all just rape away. The year is 2017. Not 1817. https://t.co/5Tj1glXcmh
Now that Trump has officially endorsed Roy Moore, he’s also decided to throw his support behind Matt Lauer’s desk button and Harvey Weinstein’s bathrobe.
People keep telling me that the voters of Alabama will elect a child predator and I reject that. No one with a shred of decency who cares about the future of our children could vote for this man. I believe Alabamans are decent and they are not capable of this.
When Trump and all of these feign agents are finally put in prison, the silence of the Republican Party will be the end of the Republican Party. They are now endorsing a child predator. And you talk about religious values? @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SpeakerRyan
We have a president who is campaigning for a child molestor. His daughter- in-law is promoting it to Alabama voters. We have a president who is campaigning for a child molestor.
This is something we can do to prevent this tax bill from killing the poor in New Jersey. We have to stand up for ourselves and for the people who can’t https://t.co/2Oz3rQb3Km
The GOP is now getting behind a child molestor. Trump is going to do a rally outside of Mobile, Alabama to indirectly support Roy Moore. Mitch McConnell is now backtracking his denunciation of Moore. The Republican Party accepts an accused child predator as a candidate.
What Republicans did last night to the poor and middle class in this country to reward huge corporations and the very wealthy is sickening. So, for all the religious beliefs you hold, rewarding the people who fund your campaigns must be somewhere in the Bible.

@Lazydaisy643 @HealthCareGov Your healthcare is from obama. Hello? Trump has done nothing but try to destroy healthcare. It’s not a great deal for everyone, especially the middle class, but the more people who sign up, the quicker the rates will even out.
Also- the more people who enroll, the quicker the rates will go down for the middle class who are getting gouged.
Healthcare enrollment ends on dec 15th. People do qualify for subsidies. 80% of people qualify. It is true that some middle class families’ payments have increased, but it is also fact that more than half of people can get ACA coverage for less than $100/ month @HealthCareGov
I don’t care who you voted for—I want everyone in this country to have health care. You can sign up at @HealthCareGov Read website carefully. 80% of people can get healthcare under $75 a month. Deadline: December 15

I understand that republicans in Alabama want a republican, so you do have the option of writing in Luther Strange rather than voting for someone accused of pedophilia. If enough people write in Luther Strange, he can win.
Trump has shown once again that he stands with Russia and is the only person in his own cabinet who repeatedly denies Russian interference as he smiles upon greeting Putin. Republicans in Congress who don’t speak up knowing what they do must be in Russia’s pockets too.
