Worth noting that the president's statement on Saudi Arabia begins with a long paragraph on... Iran: https://t.co/42WXRYSHen
No other countries, including France and the United Kingdom, have halted or slowed arms sales to Saudi Arabia. France, for instance, has exported more than 11 billion euros of weapons to Saudi since 2008.
So far, only Germany has halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi killing. It has also banned 18 people believed to be involved in the murder from traveling to Europe's Schengen area. https://t.co/nlmit64dVY
It also opens with the line: "The world is a very dangerous place!"
In the statement, Trump argues that if Saudi Arabia didn't buy its weapons from the US, it would buy them from Russia and China. #Khashoggi
In an unusual presidential statement, Donald Trump says the US will remain a "steadfast partner" of Saudi Arabia even though "it could very well be"  that Mohammed bin Salman had prior knowledge of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. https://t.co/42WXRYSHen

Theresa May is remarkably relaxed and in a jovial mood for someone who’s gone through the kind of pummeling she faced in parliament today and whose own party might try to oust her. #Brexit
Yesterday looked like a victory for Theresa May but with several cabinet resignations and the fact she doesn’t appear to have the votes to get her draft deal through Parliament, things are looking potentially dire for the PM. #brexit
Yes. Yes I am. https://t.co/kaEachYY02
Meantime, corporations and industry groups are all preparing for a no deal scenario that would force Britain to crash out of the EU without any kind of agreement.
We don't know what is in the draft agreement. We don't know whether the UK will remain in a customs arrangement with the EU, we don't know exactly what will happen to the Irish border or to Eu citizens in Britain.
For a country about to embark on an irreversible and life-altering divorce from the European Union, it is remarkable that pretty much everyone is in the dark about their leaders are negotiating in their name. #Brexit

Correction: deal is to remove heavy weaponry by October 15, not December 15. Apologies.
A lot to consider. Join us for the latest on #CNN at the top of the hour on #halagoranitonight.
Also, why would rebel areas trust Russia to patrol and protect them and the outlines of a demilitarized area? they see them as supporting and enabling Assad in relentless bombing campaigns on them. They could worry that this idea is a way to disarm rebels and hem them in.
The "deal" involves removing heavy weaponry from the area by December 15th. So may questions: why would any side agree to this? What happens in case there are hostilities in this zone? What happens to the civilians?

Trump says he apologized to Theresa May for how the Sun reported his interview, claiming he’d said positive things about her. Trump says May responded: “Don’t worry, it’s only the press.”
The Sun interview in which Trump criticized May and praised her main rival came out 16 hours ago.
President Trump calls Theresa May a “terrific woman” and says he got to know her very well over the last 24 hours after having had “breakfast, lunch and dinner” together. Calls their relationship “the highest level of special.”
Donald Trump now calling part of the Sun interview in which he criticized Theresa May’s Brexit strategy and said a trade deal was in question under her plan as “fake news.” The Sun released an audio version of the interview in which he did just that.
May invited president Trump to cement the special relationship. Instead, he gave a Murdoch-owned tabloid an interview in which he criticized her for botching Brexit, praised a departing rival and questioned a possible trade deal with the US.  https://t.co/Cm5Zup3jNp

The legislation is called the "Stop Soros" bill after Hungarian born billionaire George Soros whom Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has accused of wanting to strike “a final blow to Christian culture” by supporting migration to Europe.
Hungary is now basically criminalizing its own citizens for providing any kind of help, even if it's just information, to migrants crossing its borders.
While the world's been focused on the immigration story in America, here in Europe, Hungary just passed a bill that would result in possible jail time for anyone who:  - helps refugees fill in forms - distributes information to asylum seekers - organizes networks to help migrants

But for this one Malian, the story has happy ending: French president Macron has promised Gassama French citizenship and a job as a firefighter, which, based on his quick thinking and insane upper body strength, we can all agree would be a good career choice. 7/7
Oh and it’s not accident Mamadou came from Mali. It is a violent country (https://t.co/ravvZFqc6B) and an ex-French colony whose economy is still reeling from the after-effects of colonialism (https://t.co/62OK8TNJvF).  6/7

Gassama is a 22-year old undocumented immigrant who came to France from Mali only a few months ago. 2/7
The story of Malian Mamadou Gassama has warmed hearts around the world perhaps in part because it has briefly changed the narrative about immigration at a time when it is often – for political purposes - described as a threat. 1/7
Mamadou Gassama, the Malian immigrant who saved a toddler in an insane 4 story climb yesterday, will be granted French citizenship. https://t.co/37KlYaZ13A
