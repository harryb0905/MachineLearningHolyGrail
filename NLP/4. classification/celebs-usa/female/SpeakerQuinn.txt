We must continue to protect women against #domesticviolence and #sexualviolence. Join me in supporting #DenimDayNYC
In the next ten years, crime will only continue to get more complex, but New Yorkers will not be victimized. #safeNYC
As our understanding of threats continues to evolve, we need to make sure all resources are part of a coordinated response #safeNYC
We also need to engage in a regular review of our infrastructure to better identify vulnerabilities. #safeNYC
We shld also develop an app called “Text Something” that lets one report suspicious activity to the NYPD via photo or text. #safeNYC
We have 6,800 sanitation workers &amp; over 34,000 transit workers.  By making them a bigger part of our program, we can be even safer #safeNYC
I’m proposing that we expand basic counterterror training to agencies like the Dept of Sanitation, the Dept of Transportation, and the MTA.
Community engagement is also how we fight homegrown terrorism and that radicalization of young people.  #safeNYC
We also know that having a good relationship with community members is just as important to fighting terror as it is to fighting crime.
The same goes for our new mobile cameras.  These measures send a msg that you never know when or where we’ll be watching #safeNYC
That’s why we need to continue efforts like the Hercules Teams - heavily armed officers deployed wo warning to high level targets #safeNYC
We cannot leave our security solely in the hands federal agencies like the FBI. The face of international terror had changed #safeNYC
In the aftermath of 9/11, NYC realized that we could no longer afford to be reactive when it comes to guarding against terror. #safeNYC
The final strategy I want to discuss today is keeping New York City a leader in the fight against international terror. #safeNYC
Let’s develop an app that helps crime victims get help even in the middle of an altercation -  like the panic button at a bank #safeNYC
Let's also work with the tech industry to develop mobile apps that will help more New Yorkers keep themselves and the city safe. #safeNYC
Officers are provided smartphones, so when they respond to a call at a  building, they can immediately pull up relevant info #safeNYC
I’m proposing that we equip more police officers with mobile devices that provide instant access to police databases #safeNYC
My fourth strategy for keeping New York City safe is to continue to explore and adopt new technologies. #safeNYC
That’s why I’m proud to support Judge Lippman’s proposal to create a separate system within the court that focuses on adolescents #safeNYC
NY State though is one of only two states that still treats all 16 and 17 year olds as adults - for all crimes #safeNYC
And when police arrest dangerous criminals, we need to make sure our DAs have the resources needed to put them behind bars #safeNYC
Third, we need to match smart policing with smart prosecuting. #safeNYC
That’s one of the main reasons I’ve worked so hard to reform the CCRB. #safeNYC
Another issue is that of racial profiling.  Let me be clear - racial profiling is an illegal practice. We must have zero tolerance #safeNYC
The #ig will not pose any kind of threat to the authority of the Mayor or the Police Comm.  The buck will  stop with the Mayor #safeNYC
After Los Angeles instituted an Inspector General, crime actually fell by 33%, and public satisfaction with the LAPD rose to 83%. #safeNYC
This is the same kind of oversight that applies to other city agencies, and to law enforcement entities like the FBI.  #safeNYC #ig
To address concerns abt oversight and accountability I’ve previously indicated my support 4 the creation of an Inspector General #safeNYC
Stop and Frisk, when used correctly, is an important tool, but the number of stops has skyrocketed to unacceptable levels. #safeNYC
And in spite of the progress we’ve made, there is a rift between the NYPD and some of our communities. #safeNYC
My 2nd strategy is to continue improving police community relations - the foundation of both crime fighting and crime prevention. #safeNYC
I’m proposing that the City use capital funds to purchase 1,000 new mobile security cameras for deployment - starting with 200 this yr.
At the same time we should expand the NYPD’s cadet program, which allows college seniors to work part time for the Department #safeNYC
We’ll be able to do this wo budget increase coz hundreds more senior officers are scheduled to retire in the next three years. #safeNYC
I’m also proposing that over the next 3 yrs we hire an additional 1,600 police officers to bring our total ranks up to 36,000.  #safeNYC
To help w cuts, I propose that we accelerate the hiring of 500 new officers that were scheduled to start in January 2014. #safeNYC
finally, redouble our efforts to keep New York City safe from the threat of terror. #safeNYC
Fourth, continually embrace new technologies that allow us to fight 21st century crimes. #safeNYC
Third, increase resources for strategic prosecution, while also working to reduce the number of youth that end up in prison. #safeNYC
Second, continue to strengthen police community relations - a relationship that remains central to our ability to fight crime.  #safeNYC
First, devote more resources to policing and crime prevention, while targeting those resources to areas with the greatest need.  #safeNYC
I’m going to outline 5 strategies th'lll use what we’ve learned in the last decade to make our city even safer. #safeNYC
We launched a Task Force to Combat Gun Violence, and provided more than $4 mil to put their comm-focused strategies into action #safeNYC
We created new criminal penalties for individuals participating in gang initiations, and passed leg to make nightlife est safer #safeNYC .
In difficult budget times my colleagues and I restored cuts to put an additional 1400 officers on the streets. #safeNYC
I’m proud that in my seven years as Speaker, I’ve served as a real partner with the NYPD #safeNYC
He's brought crime down to levels many experts never believed were possible, even as other major cities have seen increases #safeNYC
Anyone who doesn’t recognize the incredible work that Ray Kelly has done as Police Comm is out of touch with the reality of life in NYC.
Though crime continues to disproportionately affect lower income communities and we need to do more #safeNYC
We’ve seen nearly 80% reductions in violent crime even in neighborhoods with historically high levels of poverty and violence. #safeNYC
Now a safer New York has been critical to our city’s growth and prosperity. #safeNYC
For last 12 years NYPD has kept us safe frm the threat of terror, a threat that our entire nation was reminded of, remains ever present
Last year, that number had dropped to 419.  That’s a 77% reduction, and the lowest it’s been since they started keeping records in 1963.
A visitor seeing NY would find it hard to believe that over 2 decades ago we were the murder capital of the US, w 2,245 homicides in 1990
Our successes would have been impossible if the NYPD under  Bloomberg Adm had not transformed this city into a safe big city. #safeNYC
That doesn’t mean we don’t face some challenges.  We need to do more to create economic opportunity in every community #safeNYC
It’s great to be here at Hunter College today, and looking out at a group of some of the best young minds in the five boroughs #safeNYC

By delaying our city's young adults access to lethal tobacco products we're decreasing the likelihood they ever start smoking.
Proud to announce leg that'll raise min smoking age frm 18 to 21; most adult smokers start smoking b4 21 http://t.co/ILWYOzdyAj

Thanks for all you do @athleteally @GLAAD @YouCanPlayTeam MT @nytimes NHL Announces Initiative 2 Support Gay Athletes http://t.co/EVWagZ33np
In case you missed my speech this am on my vision for New York's mass transit system, read it here: http://t.co/nMm6Q9BF3X #cqtransit
Our transit system is among the best in the nation; it’s what’s kept us a leader. Together we can make it even better. #cqtransit
If we save each one of our mega travelers one hour in travel weekly, that's 39 mil hrs a yr we're giving back to NYers #cqtransit
We can bring Bus Rapid Transit to SI, and ferry service to BX.  To use our transit system as fuel for new development. #cqtransit
There are no simple solutions when it comes to transportation.  But there are clear and concrete steps we can take today #cqtransit
We need to look at existing industries w room for growth, &amp; identifying new industries that can build on neighborhood strengths #cqtransit
It’s not just about getting ppl to their jobs.  It’s also about bringing jobs to where people live #cqtransit
And finally, we need to bring targeted economic dev strategies to the communities with the longest commute times in the city #cqtransit
I propose MTA extend Metro North to Penn Station, including four new station stops at Co-Op City, Parkchester, Morris Park, and Hunts Point
The 4th part of my plan uses an expansion of Metro North service to bring faster commutes to thousands of people in the Bronx #cqtransit
Let's add stops at Atlantic Ave and Red Hook, and to the north in Astoria, Roosevelt Island, 91st Street, and Ferry Point Park in the Bx.
I propose that we immediately begin working towards Phase Two of my five borough ferry plan.   #cqtransit
The East River Ferry has been v. successful.  In just 18 months it’s already served over 1.6 million riders #cqtransit
Ferries r one of the greenest forms of mass transit. They’re cheaper to start than subways, &amp; per-rider subsidy is lower thn sm bus lines
I envision a city that once again connects and moves New Yorkers through our great blue highways #cqtransit
The third part of my plan involves making better use of one of our greatest resources - our waterways #cqtransit
Let’s bring select bus service to the North Shore of Staten Island.   #cqtransit
These routes should be determined based on where can we most reduce travel times and where we see the potential 4 job growth #cqtransit
So in 2nd pt of Fair Ride NYC, I’m proposing that we commit to launching 10 new select bus service routes in the next four years #cqtransit
By collecting fares b4 riders board, providing dedicated lanes, &amp; running more buses pr hr, NYC has reduced travel times by 20% #cqtransit
A BRT route can be up and running in less than a yr.  Subways cost abt $1 billion per mile to construct.  BRT - just $1 million #cqtransit
One of the other effective ways that NYC can expand transit access is through Bus Rapid Transit. #cqtransit
Having local control of our transit will allow us to focus like a laser on the gaps in the system. #cqtransit
Having the buck stop w the mayor will bring much needed accountability, just as we’ve seen with mayoral control of our schools. #cqtransit
I also propose that the Mayor be given the authority to directly appoint the President of New York City Transit. #cqtransit
The current system has resulted in an MTA that doesn’t respond quickly enough to the city's needs. #cqtransit
If we’re going to make good on the vision I just described, I’m proposing that New York City be given control of the MTA. #cqtransit
I’m going to outline a 5 point strategy called Fair Ride NYC – a plan that will get us moving in the right direction #cqtransit
Today I’m setting a clear goal:  By the year 2023, no NYer should have to spend more than an hour commuting in either direction. #cqtransit
Long commutes means our businesses can't compete for the best talent from across the city #cqtransit
Our current transit crisis disproportionately affects lower income NYers - most who travel more than an hr, earn less than $35000 per yr
We still have a great transit system, but we need to make it better and support all New Yorkers - across all boroughs #cqtransit
Today however Manhattan accounts for less than 1/5 of our total pop and our transportation system needs to keep pace #cqtransit
Why?  Because we have a transportation system that was built to serve a different era and a different city.
Everyday NYers in the Bronx, Bk, Queens and SI spend an average of 20 mins more than those in Manhattan #cqtransit http://t.co/05MkPQ6pR8

To every middle/working class family here &amp; those dreaming to be: NYC was, NYC is &amp; NYC will always be your city #SOTC2013
Middle class families are desperate to come here and stay here, but they’re finding it harder and harder to do so.
We need to send a clear msg 2 immigrants from all over the world – we still want you and need you to continue building a stronger city.
Today I’m proposing the creation of a new $13 million fund that will allow us to provide a seat in an adult ed program for these young NYers
But of 33,000 DREAM-Act eligible youth, 16,000 need to enroll in GED, literacy or career training progs b4 they can apply 4 deferred action
One way we can use our city’s workforce system is to help more young immigrants take advantage of the Deferred Action program
If we get this right, it will mean new job opps for middle class New Yorkers, and more affordable and effective care for the elderly
The problem is, no one has defined exactly what these new jobs entail. NY is going to have2 come up w job requirements and cert procedures.
As a result, there’s going to be major demand for new jobs like community health workers, patient navigators, and care coordinators.
Because of federal and state policy reforms, our health care system is rapidly evolving.
Thru an innovative partnership with CUNY, we've trained more than 100 Nyers to fill nursing and support staff positions in high demand.
Back in 2011, I announced an initiative to prepare more NYErs for jobs as Home Care Workers - ppl who deliver daily care to elderly Nyers
And few have more potential than the rapidly expanding health care industry
Another way we’ll continue to create jobs is by focusing on sectors with the most room for growth in the years ahead.
So an entrepreneur can access funds to rent an office and hire her first employee.
For every $2 million the city puts up, we can guarantee as much as $5 million in small business lending.
We'll use city resources 2 help financial instituts by creating a new pool of city capital that'll act as a backstop for community lenders
This will create more jobs on the Staten Island waterfront, and boost sales for companies all over the city and the region.
We’ll develop a comprehensive regional plan with the goal of doubling our city’s exports by the year 2020.
We need 2 create our city’s first Regional Export Council, which will bring together govt &amp; leaders from NY, NY &amp; Port Authority.
And let’s finally take full advantage of the potential in Staten Island’s many waterfront communities.
In Washington Heights, we'll build off the success of Columbia’s biotech incubator by helping graduates start their own biotech firms.
But we won’t stop there.  In Western Queens we'll make room for the 3-D printing and other high tech manufacturing firms
In Brooklyn By fully utilizing unused industrial spaces, we’ll bring more than 2,000 new jobs to Sunset Park.
Not to mention its human capital – community groups, colleges, and thousands of hard working residents.
We’ll work with BP Diaz &amp; CM Foster to better capitalize on all that the South Bronx has to offer - its infrastructure, transit hubs, roads
And our first course of action will be a commitment to dramatically transforming the South Bronx.
It’s all about looking at existing industries with room for growth, and identifying new industries that can build on neighborhood strengths
One that works borough by borough, neighborhood by nabe, block by block. It’s a strategy I call “Keeping Opportunities Close to Home
What I’m proposing is a significant reimagining of the way the City thinks about economic development.
We've seen nearly abandoned neighborhoods transformed into thriving centers of industry. Look at what happened in DUMBO.
New York has always been a city of neighborhoods - each one with different strengths, different infrastructure, and different potential.
But a good development plan requires us not only to work from the top down, but also from the bottom up.
We need to continue to capitalize on these big development opportunities.
In the last decade, @MikeBloomberg &amp; NYC EDC have had a lot of success creating jobs by redeveloping large tracts of underutilized property
The second part of our strategy is making sure more Nyers can find jobs that pay a middle class salary
It will build on existing credits - so a family with 2 children making $75,000 a year will receive a total benefit of $2,040
Our Middle Class Credit will be available to more than 90,000 additional families, anyone making up to $150,000 a year.
Right now the city offers a credit only to families that make less than $30,000 – which leaves middle class families to fend for themselves.
Today I am proposing that New York City create a Middle Class Child Care Tax Credit
that New York City has the highest child care costs in the country - over $19,000 per year on average for infant care.
Rent isn’t the only expense that’s putting a burden on working families. For most NYers one income is not enough to enter the middle class
The Distressed Housing Preservation fund will allow HPD to purchase as many as 400 units of housing in the first year alone.  #sotc2013
I’m proposing that we create a Distressed Housing Preservation Fund 2 be used by HPD to make bulk purchases of overleveraged housing
At the height of the housing bubble, unscrupulous investors were snatching props all hoping to turn them around for a quick profit
Now for some middle and working class New Yorkers, the quality of their housing faces a different threat.
Because it isn’t about unfairly targeting landlords. It’s about taking down the slumlords that give good owners a bad name
Contrary to what you might think, this idea is supported by both tenant advocates and the real estate industry.
We’ll open up more middle class housing, just by forcing landlords to do their jobs.
we’ll create new penalties for repeat violations - so if you keep trying to get away with a quick fix, you pay the price.
That’s why w @ericdilan, we’re going to undertake the first top to bottom overhaul of the city’s Housing Maintenance Code since its creation
And just last month we passed legislation giving HPD unprecedented power to hold bad landlords accountable.
Our Tenant Protection Act for the first time gives tenants the power to sue their landlords for a pattern of harassment.
We passed the Safe Housing Act, which has already provided roof to cellar renovations in more than 1,000 of the city’s worst buildings.
That’s why over the last seven years this City Council has done more to crack down on bad landlords than any Council in NYC history.
Families who worked hard have a right to a home they can be proud of - just like my grandparents in that apartment on Isham Street.
We will not allow middle class families to get priced out of the neighborhoods they helped build.
This bill will create permanent affordability for thousands of new units that we’ll build under my middle class housing construction plan.
In exchange, we’ll require that they keep their units affordable.
The Permanent Affordability Act will give building owners a new tax exemption, by capping prop taxes at a certain % of rental income
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in our middle class – and we’re not going to let it pass us by.
Interest rates and federal mortgage rates are both at an all-time low, so we can stretch our development dollars even further.
The third strategy is to borrow additional money.
If they’re not going to use them, then let’s put them to use where they will be used -- to build housing!
These kinds of idle funds exist in other agencies as well.
4 the last couple of yrs, the Parks Dept has programmed $50 mil/yr for “miscellaneous capital projects” - money that it hasn't actually used
We also need to start using our capital budget more efficiently.
Second, we need to use every tax payer dollar we allocate in the capital budget to grow New York City.
These savings will grow in future years as we better manage our real estate, consolidate office space, and reduce our energy bill.
Similarly, as we upgrade our info technology systems, we’ve begun to achieve concrete savings that will yield at least another $35 mil/yr
This has led to better management of our vehicle fleet that will save us over $40 million a year in the capital budget.
The Council and the Bloomberg administration have undergone an effort to streamline the City’s back office operations.
Make no mistake - this will require increased financial commitment from the city.  We will do this in three different ways.
We’re going to layer it on top of the roughly 4,000 new units of housing being produced thru @MikeBloomberg New Housing Marketplace Plan.
That’s quadruple the current rate of middle class housing construction.  #sotc2013
I have a plan to build 40,000 new middle income affordable apartments over the next ten years #sotc2013
First, and most importantly, I’m proposing the biggest commitment to middle class affordability that this city has seen in two generations
So today I’m going to outline a four-part plan to make housing in New York City more affordable.     #sotc2013
It comes as no surprise to any New Yorker that affordable housing is at the heart of this crisis. #sotc2013
Our top priority must be to keep our middle class here, attract new middle class families, and give NYers the opp 2 enter the middle class.
It explains why NYC's middle class makes up a smaller percentage of our total population than it did ten and twenty years ago.  #sotc2013
This morning I released a report called the Middle Class Squeeze: http://t.co/2vccuSU5. It puts hard data behind what's impacted New Yorkers
We need to make sure everyone is on the path to a brighter future by creating even greater opp for the middle class. #soc2013
In tough times, we’ve focused on providing aid to those struggling the most.  #soc2013
W Finance Chair @domenicrecchia and @UFT, we saved 4,000 teachers from layoffs that would have devastated our schools #soc2013
W CM @StephenLevin, AM Cathy Nolan, and Sen. John Flanagan, we made kindergarten mandatory for every child in New York City. #soc2013
Thanks 2 Ed Chair @RJackson_NYC, 4,000 more families and students now have access to full day Pre-K programs each year.  #soc2013
We brought 3,000 manu jobs 2 BK Navy Yard. W @RWDSU &amp; CM Koppell we passed leg 2 bring living wages to workers in City funded projects
I’m incredibly proud that in the last seven years,@nyccouncil has built a record, not of words and criticisms, but of actions and results.
Their fortitude is what motivates me to make sure that the promise of the middle class remains alive and well
As I travel the five boroughs I talk to people with those same hopes for the future, and the same belief that there is no better place to be
A dream that his children would have better opps than he did. That’s the dream of the middle class. #sotc2013
But he knew that there was no better place than New York City to pursue his dream.  #sotc2013
Like so many immigrants he took work everywhere he could &amp; eventually ran his own small biz and put his sons thru college. #sotc2013

I believe working together we will keep NYC a place of opp for middle class families, today, tomorrow, and for generations to come.
Where we collect the data we need to hold everyone accountable – but don’t allow testing to become more important than teaching.
A system where our leaders have the authority to make bold decisions – and families have a voice in their child’s education.
Working together we’ll build an education system where having choice doesn’t mean competing for scarce resources.
We can make the entire city part of the education process, and introduce a 21st century curriculum that focuses on the whole child.
We can make learning something that happens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
We can  also find additional savings within the DOE’s budget, like the $1.2 billion they spend each year on contracts and consultants.
The proposals I’ve discussed today could cost as much as $300 mil, but we can use existing resources
And importantly, we provide high quality interventions and remedial instruction for students who are falling behind.
We  also provide training to all teachers at every grade level on how to work literacy skills into their classroom
For starters we build a strong foundation through an integrated pre-K to 3rd grade approach
We need to create the most intensive literacy support program in the country/ our kids need the basic foundation of reading and writing
So teachers can incorporate videos and interactive multimedia assignments that better engage kids living in a digital world
We currently spend $100 mil/yr on textbooks, enough $ to buy tablets for every student in NYC schools
We should move all our 1,700 schools from a system of textbooks to a system of tablets.
I’m proud to join w @Google, advocates @ business leaders who are pushing to include computer science in the new Common Core Standards.
So I’m also proposing that we make computer science classes available to students at every high school in New York City.
Also, evem if you don’t go to an early college high school, you should still have the opp to learn tech skills
We need a system that makes time for science, tech, art, music etc. - that’s not possible in a system that's built arnd standardized tests
Lastly, to prepare students for college and careers, we need an innovative curriculum that focuses on the needs of individual students
This help provide better oversight and eliminate redundancy, while sending a message that New York City is focused on the whole child
I propose that we create a new office of the Deputy Mayor for Education and Children to oversee all agencies that work directly w children
This means educators need to coordinate at every level, even if they aren’t in the same schools.
If we want to give more New Yorkers a pathway to the middle class, we have to think about our schools in a much more comprehensive way.
We’ll work with teachers, parents, students, and community groups to determine the best approach for each individual school.
We’ll start by targeting schools that face bigger challenges - 100 schools w highest % of students who qualify 4 free or reduced price lunch
Today I’m proposing that we keep more of our kids in a structured education program until 6pm, five days a week
The most comprehensive involves actually increasing the number of hours that both students and teachers are in school
Dozens of studies over the last decade show the same results: more learning time leads to greater academic achievement &amp; better attendance
With Parents Matter we’ll make parents real partners in our education system, and make sure learning continues at home.
We’ll introduce a CompStat for our Parent 311 hotline and track the amount of time it takes for a family’s issue to get resolved
We’ll make sure every Parent Coordinator and Family Advocate is fully trained, supported, and resourced.
So the second part of Parents Matter will be a commitment to providing the best customer service to every family.
But we still have a long way to go before every family feels like their concerns are being heard and their problems are being solved.
We already have the infrastructure in place – our Parent Coordinators and District Family Advocates.
You enter basic info abt your child’s academic history and what they’re looking and you get a comparison of schools that may be a good fit
We’re partnering with InsideSchools to launch an online tool to help simplify the complicated school choice system
I’m proposing a Mentor Teacher program, where every new teacher receives a yr of intensive hands-on support frm our city’s best teachers.
The great news is, we don’t need to hire consultants -- we have experts of our own, 1000s of top performing teachers
We’ll create a red alert system for struggling schools, and identify  early indicators well before they’re slated to close.
And we don’t have to wait for a school to get bad grades on its report card before we provide them with some extra support.
W/ Systemwide Success Study, we can finally use charters how they were intended - figure out what the best are doing &amp; use that knowledge
This is how we can finally make good on the promise of charter schools.
We’ll identify best practices, and apply them to schools with similar populations or similar challenges
This will be an in depth analysis of what techniques from our best perform schools have proven most successful w/ diff types of students.
We're currently in discussions with Columbia Teachers College, to take the lead on an initiative we’re calling the Systemwide Success Study.
It means reducing the amount of time we spend on test prep, so we can focus on skills that prepare students for 21st century careers.
Lastly, we adopt a 21st century curriculum that focuses on the whole child
Third: Community Schools.  We make everything kids need available through a coordinated effort frm after school prgms , health care to meals
That means empowering parents to continue teaching at home, and better engaging families in all parts of the system.
Secondly, we make learning something that happens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
We identify the best parts of our system  and we use their best practices to lift everybody up and make the whole system stronger.
I’m going to outline a four-point strategy that will pave the way for a new century of opp -  No. 1 – Best Practices, Better Schools.
Graduation rates have risen across the city by almost 15% since 2005 but they’re not high enough -- &amp; only 1 in 4 graduates is college ready
We need a public education system that prepares every student for the jobs of the 21st century.

Working together, as one city, we will rise from this devastation stronger &amp; more united than ever before. #Sandy #recovery
There is no task too great for NYers. They're ready to act. We in government must be ready to lead.
#NYC's history is a story of progress, of smart investments, &amp; adapting to changing times. This hour is no different. We must act.
Even if we need to take on some costs locally or turn to the private sector, we must make these investments. Our future depends on them.
We need the federal government to invest in #NY's citizens, to he'll us rebuild #NYC safer than before
We must continue to invest in resilient means of transport. Buses &amp; ferries were running ~24hrs after #Sandy.
We will work to pass legislation requiring the use of new pavement materials that absorb rainwater &amp; prevent sewer overflows
Our plan includes accelerating major sewer &amp; wastewater treatment projects to make sure they can stand up to storms &amp; to common flooding
I'm demanding that oil co.s work w/ fed regulators &amp; local leaders on system-wide overhaul to ensure we have the fuel we need in emergencies

.@ChuckSchumer will take the lead in Congress &amp; work w/ Obama Admin to get an #Army Corps study to examine strengthening our defenses
The time for debate is over. It's now clear we need to build protective structures--sea walls, bulkheads, dunes, wetlands, flood gates
.@NYCCouncil will hold hearings to examine the response to #Sandy, but we must also look ahead. We must rebuild &amp; we must rebuild smarter
#Sandy was a wake-u call. Our nation needs to take on climate change. #NYC has worked to be a leader, but we need the fed gov to be involved
#NYC will learn from #Sandy. In the coming months, we must have a conversation as a city about our response to disasters
Thank you to @MikeBloomberg @JohnCLiu &amp; @NYCCouncil colleagues for working together &amp; for acting swiftly to restore vital services to #NYC
Schools are often a second home for our children and restoring sense of normalcy to their lives is a priority
#Sandy caused significant damage throughout #NYC &amp; the emergency funding  shows we’re taking this seriously
Tomorrow the @NYCCouncil will approve $500million in capital appropriation to repair @NYCSchools facilities &amp; hospitals

Budget agreement also restores $90M in proposed cuts to libraries, w/ no layoffs.
Today’s budget agreement is a victory for working families at every income level.
We’ve also made key changes to the Early Learn NYC proposal – and age childcare down to include more infants and toddlers.
We've brought the total number of child care seats to over 50,000 and the total number of OST seats to over 57,000.
Aftr facing a possible loss of more than 6,500 child care seats &amp; 30,000 Out of School Time seats, we restored funding to beyond FY12 levels
We've also worked with the DOE and DC37 to prevent the layoff of 400 school aides.
Proud that we were not only able to preserve #child care but also to make in an integral part of our #education system.

Thanks to @RJackson_NYC and @JessLappin for coming out to call on the MTA to follow NYC crane safety regs when in the City #crane
Officials have been eyeballing violations this morning, but we still don't know the cause of last night's collapse #crane
We license all crane operators but NYC inspections only happen at the beginning, we need to be able to continually evaluate the situation
We need the MTA and other state agencies to give us oversight authority at construction sites much like our MOU with the Port Authority
In fact, City officials who were invited onto the site after the incident found conditions that would have qualified as violations
The State must follow New York City safety regulations when working in our City.  #crane
Current laws make it impossible to ensure safety regulations are upheld to the highest standards.  #crane
The cause is still under investigation though this terrible incident highlights the need for better coordination between the MTA & the City
Our prayers are with the friends and families of the deceased and injured. #crane
I want to thank the Dept of Investigation, the Dept of Buildings and the NYPD for their rapid response to the tragic crane incident.

We look forward to having an in-depth, open discussion about NYCs restaurant inspection process and #grading system
At our hearing today, we're going to tackle qts of whether revenue generation is a goal of this system. Why are avg violation pts going up?
The current system is inconsistent and lacks fairness. #restaurantgrading
I support restaurant grading, but the grades need to be meaningful for the system to work. #restaurantgrading
Also, notably 68% of respondents said the system had increased their costs significantly #restaurantgrading
67% of ppl who responded to us have earned As on their inspection and yet a majority of them called the system poor #restaurantgrading
Nearly 1300 people responded: and we found that the majority of restaurateurs rated the City's letter grading system poor #restaurantgrading

RT @JumaaneWilliams: I thank @ChrisCQuinn for working with the Task Force to Combat #GunViolence
That there is no greater power in the world than the power of our ppl – those who inhabit the small towns that make up the great City of NY
The dream of every New Yorker is always within our grasp. That opportunity is not a privilege but a promise.
That means a total of $140 million that CUNY can use for renovations and upgrades
In this year’s budget, the Council will be pushing for a full $71 million in additional capital funds to CUNY.
We’re working with the State to pass a bill allowing New York City to make kindergarten mandatory.
The last point I want to discuss today might be the most critical for the future of our communities and the future of our city – education.
Then we’ll work with city agencies and residents to make repairs. By harnessing the power of communities, we'll make our neighborhoods safer
Working with comm leaders and local youth, we’ll survey these places and find every spot that invites crime
We’re going to launch a program called Youth SHIELD which stands for Safe Havens, Improved Environments, Local Development.
Best of all, we’ll create 175 new jobs. And, we’ll offer those jobs to NYCHA residents who can get trained in new skills
W/ CM Mendez and NYCHA Chair Rhea, we’re going to add money to NYCHA's budget so they can make more than 100,000 repairs in the next yyr
Now we'll pass legislation, sponsored by CM Brewer, that allows the HPD to target the root cause of a housing problem.
This year we’ll expand on the success of our Safe Housing Act, a law we passed in 2007.
Now it’s not enough to just make sure New Yorkers have a place to live. We need to make sure those homes aren’t falling apart
It The avg cost of a rental subsidy for a family of 4 is $800 a month. At a shelter? $3,000.
We need to prioritize homeless NYers for NYCHA apts and Section 8 vouchers, so we can get even more families into long term stable housing.
Working together we can create a brand new rental assistance program to help families cover rent in private buildings.
That’s why CM  Palma and I are calling on the City to create a new program to get homeless families off the streets/shelters, and into homes
If these kids are going to have a fighting chance, we need to get their families back on the path to stable housing.
There are currently 10,000 families living in homeless shelters in New York City, some with children just a few months old.
As we work to provide all our neighbors with an affordable place to live, we can’t ignore the growing number of homeless New Yorkers
It’s the least we can do to thank the men and women who have done and do so much for our country.
We’re going to stop this – by introducing legislation sponsored by Assembly Member Cusick and Senator  Lanza that will fix the problem.
. The more we spend on schools, the less veterans get.
NY State has a homeowner’s tax exemption for veterans. But value of their exemption rises & falls w/ how much the City spends on schools
Now there’s another group of New Yorkers whose homes are getting less affordable: our city’s veterans.
Our goal will be a new kind of deal with developers as long as the City renews your benefits, you have to keep your housing truly affordable
I'm happy to announce that HPD is going to start requiring sixty year affordability in many of our biggest developments.
So let’s talk about an idea that’s long overdue in New York City – permanent affordability.
It’s impossible to talk about rising costs without talking about housing #soc
This kind of creative health care model has the power to connect more New Yorkers to primary care
W/ CM Arroyo, we’re going to help the Freelancers launch a flagship clinic, to provide low cost care to any member who needs it
So this year we’ll bring the Hotel Trades model to a group of New Yorkers that has a hard time affording health care – freelancers.  #soc
You may think that sounds crazy. I think it’s crazy we’ve waited so long to try and replicate their success
By providing their own insurance, the union has developed a system so efficient they can offer free coverage at 1/3 the cost of the avg HMO
The Hotel Workers Union, under Peter Ward, has created a network of one-stop clinics where members can receive any care they need, 4 free
But some employers have found innovative ways to provide top quality health care while reducing everyone’s costs.
Premiums are up more than 50% in the last ten years, and many employers have responded by asking their workers to contribute even more.
Another growing cost for New York families is health care
This is the first of its kind in the nation and could become a model for families across the country
Allowing families to pay it back over time through a low cost loan.
So working with CM Lappin & Sen Squadron, we’re going to launch a pilot program, where the City covers half the upfront costs of child care
There’s a group that’s been left out : middle income families who can’t afford child care, but  make too much for subsidized programs
There’s more to do, and we’re committed to working with community advocates to protect and expand child care for low income parents.
We’re grateful to Governor Cuomo for restoring cuts that would have cost thousands of local families their child care.   #soc
Another major obstacle for many New Yorkers is balancing the demands of a job with the demands of a family #soc
Participants will spend up to eight weeks in a paid training program at a company that has a full time job opening.
So working with CM Reyna and SBS, we’re going to launch a brand new pilot program called New Skills, New Jobs.
Many are looking to get an internship and learn new skills but they just can’t afford to work for free.
New Yorkers’ unemployment benefits are running out and many have had to dip into their retirement savings to get by.
And the longer you’re out of work, the harder it gets to find a job
All these initiatives I’ve mentioned will help us create more job opp. But for some, the barriers to employment extends beyond job shortage
W/ CM Dickens, EDC Pres Seth Pinsky & Rob Walsh we’ll create a $10 mil small biz loan fund exclusively for biz in high unemployment places
But we’ve never used them for small businesses #soc
There’s a federal program called the New Markets Tax Credit. Every year New York City uses New Markets credits for construction. #soc
Another way we can target community investment is by helping small businesses expand so they can hire more workers #soc
We’re going to work with Kickstarter & CM Al Vann to help people raise money for creative businesses in neighborhoods with high unemployment
A LES tech startup called @Kickstarter that uses the energy & potential of online communities to bring investment to real-world places
These days communities don’t just exist in a physical place – they also exist online. #soc
=Our second strategy will empower people to invest in neighborhoods with high unemployment #soc
It’ll provide equipment, studios and office space for 200 professionals and students.  #soc
So w/ CM Letitia James, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, & Macro Sea, we’re going to build a state-of-the-art shared manufacturing center. #soc
Nowadays, this industry requires high tech equipment, which can be too expensive for small manufacturing firms to afford on their own #soc
And speaking of manufacturing, our city is primed to become a center of next generation manufacturing.  #soc
These are good, middle class jobs, ranging from marketing to manufacturing. #soc
It will be a global event, attracting visitors from around the world, and putting our designers right in the spotlight.  #soc
W/ CM Karen Koslowitz, we’re going to create and host a New York City Design Week.
We have more designers than any city in the US. We’ll grow our design sector by stealing an idea from the fash industry.  #soc
So what’s one of the industries that New York is known for? Design.  #soc
These initiatives will help get New Yorkers back to work but there’s plenty more that needs to be done #soc
This is a booming field. We’re going to give Nyers the skills they need to get hired. #soc
This fall, we’re going to launch our new software language certificate program at CUNY.  #soc
And the first ever venture capital fund in the borough has formed to support new tech companies in these neighborhoods #soc
In the last few months, industry leaders in all three corners have launched a formal partnership.  #soc
We talked about linking DUMBO, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Downtown Brooklyn into a thriving tech triangle.
I’m proud to say we’ve already made progress on many of the ideas we proposed.  #soc
A few months ago, I laid out the Council’s vision for strengthening our economy and getting New Yorkers back to work. #soc
Now let’s talk about one of the greatest challenges facing New Yorkers in every neighborhood – unemployment #soc
We’ll build on his and the Council’s current efforts, by adding weekly legal clinics in 30 immigrant neighborhoods. #soc
.@mikebloomberg deserves a lot of credit for his work to make NYC an even more welcoming and supportive place for immigrants #soc
Working w/ Council Member Danny Dromm we’re going to dramatically increase the amount of free immigration services in the five boroughs #soc
We have to keep that dream alive for future generations. That’s why we’ll be working with @MMViverito to pass the DREAM Act. #soc
Many arrived on our shores unable to read or write. But they dreamt that one day their children could grow up to be docs/lawyers/engineers
New York City was built by generation after generation of immigrants who came here to pursue the American Dream.  #soc
So today let’s talk about ways we can use the strength of our communities to create opportunity for every New Yorker. #soc
We need to restore the promise that everyone can succeed in NY, no matter how humble their origins #soc
Now more than ever, we need to tap into the power of our communities. #soc
That energy is contagious, it lifts you up &carries you to greater heights, it makes everything bigger than just the sum of its parts #soc
There’s an energy created when New Yorkers are brought together, like a chemical reaction #soc
We’re a patchwork of small towns woven into neighborhoods, stitched together to form boroughs, creating the fabric of the city #soc
Ppl who have never visited NY often see it as an intimidating metropolis, cold & impersonal. But NYers know the truth. We're not a big city

The politicization of breast cancer screening funding decisions by Susan G. Komen will certainly affect all women across the country.
Planned Parenthood helps thousands of women nationwide identify breast cancer early when there is the best chance of successful treatment.
And despite their protests to the contrary, appear to be a direct result of  years of pressure from opponents of women’s healthcare.
Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation's decision to cut off funding for breast cancer exams at Planned Parenthood is disappointing
That way both the @NYCCouncil and the public can see exactly where our money is going and where we can cut back
We will also require all city contracts to be summarized in plain language and made available online
The bill also requires HPD to provide #foreclosure info to agencies responsible for investigating illegal conversion complaints

It is a policy that is fair and one that will help workers, will not deter job growth and one that I am honored to support
At the end of the day they have a choice as to whether or not they want the money offered and the wage requirements
I believe it is fair for govt to place requirements on a biz that has voluntarily entered into an economic dev agreement with the city.
We will require cos that get substantial subsidies from the city to pay their employees a living wage of $10 or $11.50 depending on benefits

Unfortunately, @mikebloomberg & I couldn’t disagree more on fingerprinting food stamp applicants  #NYC
In these tough economic times, we need to help New Yorkers get the federal services they qualify for, not put obstacles in their way

The spike in food stamp disqualifications is also alarming because HRA has not provided an explanation for it
This is the highest decrease in enrollment since Dec 2010. At this time of need, we must help NYers acquire benefits to alleviate hardship
