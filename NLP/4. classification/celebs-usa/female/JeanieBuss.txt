@LakerFilmRoom Great question! I am going to read replies like this..... https://t.co/suG7BTUPlR
@CBBUSLiveFeeds I think Metta is playing a great Big Brother game. He has stayed below the radar and he is winning friends with his social game. If he thinks it’s harder to play Big Brother maybe if he had Kobe with him it would be easier.
Now that the #SpiceGirlsReunion is taking place I thought about one of my favorites from 1995 “HOW BIZARRE” Was I alone in liking this song? “Brother Pele’s in the back Sweet Zina’s in the front Crusin’ down the freeway in the hot, hot sun..” 🤪 https://t.co/28PijQvo2o

@kamariesdad I agree. Had team died I believe franchise would have folded &amp; Lakers as we know them would not exist. Would make a great movie

Last yr over lets move onRT @davesportsgod: Why do people continue to call Kobe a good defensive player? He hasn't guarded anyone in 3 years
OOPS!RT @filipefurtado:@JeanieBuss has a bit of selecrive memory.Lakers 29-19 on pre season during PJ second stint,even if it doesn't matter
@davesportsgod So much uncertainty re. future during 1st rd may have bn a distraction but only a person inside locker room could tell you.
@davesportsgod Disappointed you would say that. Losing in playoffs is awful for Phil-he is still bothered by it.
@davesportsgod No excuses for being swept. We did lose to team that won championship. Many factors involved but don't say Phil gave up.
NOT TRUE DAVE.RT @davesportsgod: I said he was greatest coach ever, but his team quit on him in the playoffs & it was time 4 him 2 move on.
I don't think Phil ever had a winning preseason w/ either Bulls or Lakers. No need 2 worry. Just so happy to see #Lakers again!
