@mikeorren Hey Mike. Let me try to get to the bottom of this. Thanks for flagging
@jason_kint This isn't "sheryl and elliot". And speaking as a former journalist, I think you are wrong. More transparency by us (and anyone advertising on the platform) is the right thing to do.
@jason_kint It's is personal Jason. And beneath you.
I'm addressing some of the misconceptions about our new political ads policy and how it relates to news publishers. Hope this helps clarify: https://t.co/GWEIAh31me
Thanks for a great conversation! https://t.co/vSeJgwc5Mf
Journalists arguing against transparency? Seriously? Establishing a separate archive is important, but transparency for ALL also important. This is the direction we need to move. Election integrity is paramount. https://t.co/1rnKKpG6ge

@tim @MattGarrahan Tim, your story misconstrues the meaning of my remarks today. I have clarified them now numerous times. I would appreciate it if you would clarify in your piece. #journalism
@TheLloydGrove Disagreed with the lawyers :)
@TheLloydGrove "attacked"? C'mon. Hardly.
@tim @MattGarrahan to clarify - i do think fake news may be pushing us into a world where we have to verify news orgs through quality signals or other means.
@mathewi To clarify - I do think fake news will push us into a world where there will be a need to verify news orgs using quality signals. Though will be hard to get broad consensus on what that means.
@jason_kint @raju But I also think journalism is an actual skill. In the same way that not everyone can call themselves an engineer, not just anyone should be able to call themselves a journalist. If you are trafficking in rumor and fake news - that’s not journalism.
@jason_kint @raju to clarify. I think fake news may push us into a world where news orgs are verified in some way - through use of quality signals etc.
@pkafka It’s not one or the other. The intent is to help publishers identify real breaking news during big moments - at their request. Limits on # of times a pub can label so it’s not over-used.
Looking forward to it! https://t.co/MbNjY63GcR

.@nhannahjones sorry ur offended by this. I thought you brought an important point to light - but was missing a critical piece IMHO
.@nhannahjones how the charters in your neighborhood getting very diff results factor into equation. Critical part of conversation
.@nhannahjones don't know you at all. But was wildly curious to hear your view. Which is why I was disappointed you didn't mention.
.@nhannahjones so you're just anti-charter? Maybe worth mentioning
.@nhannahjones and mine isn't? Would have been great to hear your take on those schools and what you really think is going on there.
.@nhannahjones curious about why you didn't include them? Did you visit or think about it? And to be clear - we all have an agenda
Unfortunate @nhannahjones overlooked the great public charter schools in her neighborhood https://t.co/YfVsMWwEe1 https://t.co/k3bneZSsuH

@dropoutnation I don't disagree with you RiShawn. But while you may think the Success parents are wrong, they love the school.
@dropoutnation @SuccessCharters @amyvirshup @sowhesed one parent -- unless they changed the piece
@dropoutnation @SuccessCharters @amyvirshup @sowhesed was stunning to me frankly how little interest the reporter had in parents reaction
@dropoutnation @SuccessCharters @amyvirshup @sowhesed Dont condone what teacher did by any means, but the journalism was highly problematic
Amazing press conference happening right now with @SuccessCharters parents denouncing @nytimes @katetaylornyt for biased story
WOW. Read @katetaylornyt twitter feed w/ her own comments promoting her @SuccessCharters story. Not one mention of what parents told her
.@amyvirshup does @nytimes plan to post audio of parents being interviewed? you use more quotes from your outside "expert" than from parents
.@amyvirshup by all means, post it! It's on youtube -- if you care about a balanced conversation.
.@amyvirshup why not post the video of parents talking to @katetaylornyt? why dont't you want that to be part of the conversation too?
.@amyvirshup ONE PARENT. It astounds me you dont get this is about parents CHOOSING Success for thier kids. and no link to parent video?!
.@amyvirshup ONE quote from ONE parent. multiple anonymous sources &amp; multiple quotes from outside critics. No link to parent video? please
.@juleshyman ONE quote from ONE parent. multiple anonymous sources &amp; multiple quotes from outside critics. Not balanced piece by any means
