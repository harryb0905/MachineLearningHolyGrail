Appreciate my guys @TheSportsShop1 having me on the show and giving the #WNBA  some coverage. #WNBAPlayoffs https://t.co/Nuw0aKJ71z
#TheShopHBO  Don't watch it,  if you want them to lie to you and make it sound fly to you...
Gotta check out @KingJames The Shop on @HBO
Growing up bracing yourself after you realized you slammed the door.. https://t.co/yrfjmSi77D
@Mystreaux True great defense by @E_Williams_1 to secure the win for @AtlantaDream  @WashMystics  are in trouble.  #WNBAPlayoffs
@Mystreaux Not really they didn't have an answer for EDD...
This series just went up fro grabs real quick.. #WNBAPlayoffs #MysticsDream
@ChristyWScott51 Yeah me too prayers up for @De11eDonne
@ChristyWScott51 Sucks  27pts 13 rebounds 6 assist https://t.co/lgKhdjJBpS
EDD was putting on a clinic..this one sucks. Athletes worst nightmare  #wnbaplayoffs #injuries
I have seen this too many times before....
EDD makes struggling offensively look good. #WNBAPlayoffs #MysticsDream
@cjjohnsonjr I figure out which thing or person is a distraction. Then I meditate and pray  for the best way to deal with the distraction if it’s a person. If it’s a thing, I just get rid of it or take a break from it.
#TuesdayThoughts If God is a woman then my mother is God.
Pretty good play call but better defense.
*Loyd
What a shot by Lloyd dropped a rare jewel on @PhoenixMercury might be the dagger in Game 1. #WNBAPlayoffs
I love time and score situations.  My favorite part of the game.
Wow 👀 phantom call there on Brian January... #WNBAPlayoffs
👀  @seattlestorm with this lead crucial time for @PhoenixMercury uh ohhhhh!
@ken72408395 She’s a Problem!
Both @PhoenixMercury &amp; @seattlestorm out here Ballin on a Sunday these ladies got me saying Hallelujah 🙌🏾  #WNBAPlayoffs
Bird with that signature Pull Up J still got it all day everyday. #WNBAPlayoffs
DB with the tough fadeaway and @PhoenixMercury is here to play. #WNBAPlayoffs
Sue Bird says it’s “Showtime” #WNBAPlayoffs
EDD single handily carried @WashMystics today in a Game 1 win over @AtlantaDream expect a @KristiToliver bounce back game in Game 2. #WNBAPlayoffs
Thanks @karalawson20 appreciate ya on the play call.
@ChristyWScott51 @De11eDonne @WashMystics @WNBA Not settling worked hard for all 30 except the free throws those are easy for her...
I really love the backcourt for the Dream but I love my bIg girls wish they would mix it up a little and get some ISO’s on the block for @E_Williams_1  #MysticsDream  #WNBAPlayoffs
EDD ain’t playing around. #MysticsDream
@FinestMagazine I agree she is mixing it up, loving the work on the block getting in the paint &amp; not shying away. She is welcoming the physicality. Playing “Grown Woman Basketball.” #WNBAPlayoffs #MysticsDream
You Rock! Thanks for being you and making it do what it do. https://t.co/2DCaV3im1c
@jaszthomas @ConnecticutSun Yes sooner rather than later, would love to have seen this in a series. Definitely could see you guys having a bounce back game to even it up.
@DishNSwish You don’t poke the Bear.

Looking forward to @ncstate #packpalooza this Saturday. I will be speaking on behalf of the @KayYowFund.  It's going to be a beautiful day!
I know it's #NFL season but  Diana Taurasi is undisputed and 13-0 in #WNBAPlayoffs winner-take-all games.  Hope @ShannonSharpe or @RealSkipBayless at least recognize one of the greatest basketball players in this era. She also plays in @KingJames kicks if that helps. ;)
Waiting on the @TheUndefeated Diana Taurasi post about her being 13-0 in the winner-take-all #WNBAPlayoffs  games.  I mean she is "Undefeated".  Or maybe I missed it.
The @ConnecticutSun are a group of young talented players who need valuable playoff experience. They aren’t going to get that in single elimination games. #WNBAPlayoffs
@DishNSwish Wayment don’t nobody talk about @CamilleLittle
@SheKnowsSports_ 🤦🏾‍♀️ You don’t bet against Dirty Diana. #wnbaplayoffs
“I’m happy today, holla if you hear me.” Diana Taurasi  #WNBAPlayoffs https://t.co/vN1y10vtZV

@DanielleKoonce Right I shed a tear Dee no I don’t know who he is or if he is an actor but if he is selling I’m buying...I’m watching like are my eyes playing tricks on me.
Okay Griner got emotional!  When she brings  out that grine in Griner. #WNBAPlayoffs https://t.co/0EnQLk3hkR
@MandisaRN
She needed an escape dribble there.. #justsayin
I see you @angelrobinson33 ...
@KeepBlitzin The realest tweet I’ve read today.
I would have loved for Griner to throw one those shots on that last possession.
DT just attacked the paint like who gonna check me Boo?  #WNBAPlayoffs https://t.co/SoPVFfrddk
I hope @WashMystics make the Finals for my fans in DC. Those Die Hards you gotta love em'.  #WNBAPlayoffs
She's tired Shugg...
@c0011j @SkyDigg4 Well I was more reminiscing about my playing days..lol
@mntwins020733 Best of 3  2nd round...
@tyoung11 @sswoopes22 lol riggggght let me holla @sswoopes22 tell her  I'm asking for a friend.. :)
@mntwins020733 nope 2nd round for sure though... I like the playoffs starting with single elimination
@Pat_Ralph @WNBAinsidr A lost is a lost, lose by 1 lose by 20...they should be confident going into the summer still making the playoffs  despite their inconsistent regular season.
Nope leave the travel schedule argument out of it...Now this single elimination argument we can talk. #WNBAPlayoffs https://t.co/mnfxqzYStG
@tyoung11 @sswoopes22 Cmon you know you wanted that  Red &amp; White pair...nevermind SneakerHead you prolly got 2 pair!  ;)
Oh you are sure @karalawson20 they don't have enough energy.  As one of my Old Skool BBall coaches used to say, "the oxygen isn't even getting to their brain right now".
Thanks @FinestMagazine for your timeline, I'm just tuning in.  I see the @WashMystics  got the @LA_Sparks mystified right now. #WNBAPlayoffs
@Mocurrie25 @WNBA Ball out MoCurrie, be a leader!

AB @Alanabeard20 got me so tired tonight watching her on the defensive end of the court. I will get some rest for her tonight.
@CoachKiwi Hello out there,You know I see you cheering on your girl. Here she comes to save the day tell them Chelsea Gray is on the way and the @sparks live to play another day... #delirioustweet
@Candace_Parker most definitely rebounds in DC this matchup is about to be lit!  #mysticvssparks #WNBAPlayoffs
Coach Reeves should just take her jacket off just because...do it for the fans it's part of the rivalry... #WNBAPlayoffs
Yeah I put Redd to bed at 8:30...lol I can't he knows I tune in for the real season. https://t.co/6JlzngtBG1
@ChristyWScott51 @Nnemkadi30 lol I am more like flop but she's undersized gotta make it do what it do.
Everyone on the east coast is like forget this replay.. Play on #WNBAPlayoffs
Dagger by @cgray209 but I'm still going to finish the game.  #WNBAPlayoffs
@Lindsay_13  aint' going out without a fight...  #WNBAPlayoffs
@RichardCohen1 Simply a bad call..
@RichardCohen1 That was just a bad call.

@cjjohnsonjr Use your gift, go after what keeps you awake at night.
So @russwest44 is at the game with wifey. Well #whynot  #WNBAPlayoffs
@Trackstar27806 @nemchocke @Nnemkadi30 Hopefully everyone gets this memo.
@nemchocke @Nnemkadi30 True gotta love the different style the ladies can rock! Thank God for braids relaxers just don't cut it for sistas when you fly commercial, have back to backs and don't get paid enough for your stylist to travel. Only a few buy that expensive weave.
I like @Nnemkadi30 braids. Fresh to death. Look good you play good!  #WNBAPlayoffs #Sparks
XFactor  @PhoenixMercury versus @DallasWings ? The BackBoard. It was a factor for  #DeWannaBonner tonight.  #WNBAPlayoffs
@WomensHoopsBlog lol rigggggggggghhhhhhtttt
It really doesn't matter what pro basketball game I watch #NBA #WNBA #GLeague even if it's a blowout, I still keep watching. I'm listening to the commentators if they're good and watching how the coaches manage the game.
DB looked over at her coach and said, " I got babies at home".  Not taking that charge on Cambage... #wnbaplayoffs #mercuryvswings
Coach Brondello is sitting down at this point. Relinquishing coaching duties to her pt forward DT. #WNBAPlayoffs
Glasssssssssssssss! Someone in Phoenix  heard DB call that!  #WNBAPlayoffs
The @PhoenixMercury is rising and the @DallasWings better take flight sooner rather than later...   #WNBAPlayoffs
Diana Taurasi is one of the few players that can stay hot for both halves of a ball game. Another reason she has the elite status.   #WNBAPlayoffs
@karalawson20 @KingJames @DianaTaurasi I add @StephenCurry30  to that group. Really underrated passer, overshadowed by his shooting ability.
Taurasi  out here already like  "You know why I'm here" .  #WNBAPlayoffs
Gotta send some positive vibes for @tmmcwilliams tonight as the lights shine bright!  #WNBAPlayoffs #MercuryvsWings
Me waiting on that BGB "Big Girl Basketball"  Griner/Cambage  Fowles/Parker  I'm about to watch them work. Who wins tonight?   #WNBAPlayoffs #ESPN2

@Xenilou1 Love my Rocker fans
I love this game!
@ndwbb Young  👀  she’s lit right now.
I need some stats how many times has UConn gotten blocked at the 3pt line twice in the 1st quarter this year.
I agree but st the end of the day overtime was a new game.  B-ball is a game of runs dawgs made the last run. https://t.co/AKadnx83aG
Yeah the technical foul changed the momentum. https://t.co/Au2um0nmjJ
Loved the game plan and fight of @UofLWBB. Congrats on a helluva season and thanks for your support of the @KayYowFund  #play4kay
I believe the  foul would have been called late but Louisville secured the rebound so they let it play out.
Great season @PackWomensBball  proud of you.

A8: In today's sports world @serenawilliams  empowers me on and off the court. Like Rena if I could be like Rena!   #athletesforprogress
A8: So many women have inspired me, but at a young age my late Coach #KayYow and @uncwbbcoach in NC changed my mindset. #athletesforprogress
A7: I can use my platform on social media to share engaging &amp; positive post and share my story-via my book to inspire. #athletesforprogress
A7: Engage with the young girls teach them how much fun it is to participate in sports and how it helped my confidence. #athletesforprogress
A6:  We have to get more parents involved to get girls to participate in sports. They listen to stereotypes. #athletesforprogress
A5: Also to engage more women in leadership - women have to support each other more and leave personal out of business. #athletesforprogress
A5: 1st women are leaders-leadership roles? when we are knocking, ringing the doorbell, open the door and invite us in. #athletesforprogress
A4: #metoo and #timesup shows despite wealth, social status, &amp; degrees our voice is our power &amp; it makes things happen. #athletesforprogress
A3: Equality issues --- overlooking or downplaying qualifications when women try to get in higher positions in sports.  #athletesforprogress
A3: Gender equality issues most relevant today, fairness in opportunities, culture of Patriarchy, gap in pay wages. #athletesforprogress
RT @GirlsintheGame A1: means empowering young girls today so they can be strong women tomorrow #PressforProgress #athletesforprogress
A2: The movement has empowered me to recognize &amp; use my voice, got to college for free and show my talent in the #wnba #athletesforprogress
A1: #PressforProgress is women reaching their full potential, breaking stereotypes and closing the gap.  #athletesforprogress
I look forward to joining @Ath4Hope today at noon. Discussing #athletesforprogress  #InternationalWomensDay

@PackMensBball needed to get the ball inside that play.
@DanielleKoonce Every time I've seen that injury happens in person or on TV,  the player looks back like someone kicked them, then when they try to stand up they can't.

@DanielleKoonce I told @hoopism Lindsay needed one big game that would. E the difference oh and Fowles no answer...
You know you a Beast when you break your own records.. https://t.co/m1IV1kmaXA

@ProHoopsHistory Mindy beat them tonight Sparks still played out of sync offensively
Yeah Dan's the man with the plan.. https://t.co/wuEHgfqLMt
#sylviafowles  is about  to have 2 MVP's    Been in beastmode all game "you know why I'm here" ... 🏆 #wnbafinals
#lindsAywhalen "Weezy F Baby" just needed on game. As they say you're only as good as your last game. #wnbafinals
There's a championship on the line..and  the #lynx are about to take it..
Can't unravel now...Lynx out there just Maintaining. Both teams are exhausted... truly leaving it all out there.. #WNBAFinals
Good defense better offense...
If #sparks take the lead they will win... #WNBAFINALS
#chelseaGray says move B get out the way...shook everybody even her teammates. #WNBAFinals
@glfish3 Even Redd is nervous lol pacing back and forth lol
Rebounds win championships.. advantage #lynx beastin on the boards... #WNBAFinals
#wnba true ballers and yes they are exhausted no private jets...security taking shoes off...but things will get better...
We fly commercial..so if that's the best flight and time it could easily happen.. https://t.co/rJLbroAwPb
@ABS20004 Exactly the Sparks can play so much better &amp; I think the Lynx  can only try to sustain their play...
@hoopism Sparks
True ballers didn't speak the entire trip... I know that's righhhhttttt... #WNBAFinals
I still feel like #LASparks can win this... #WNBAFinals
#CandaceParker got moves for days... Brunson can't guard Parker they need to clear it out for her... #WNBAFinals
@hoopism I don't think I can tweet during this game.
Dan Welcome Back! Welcome Back! Welcome Back! The W missed you. #seattlestorm https://t.co/ZbOdZKlc61

Offense wins games, Defense wins possessions, Rebounds win championships. https://t.co/beTqkNhToJ
@AkiemBailum pressure is on the @minnesotalynx
I only expect that if they play individually like they did tonight. They stopped themselves offensively. https://t.co/9Y7NwaFLMv
Basketball is still a game of runs. @minnesotalynx had the last run tonight but who will get the last run in Game 5? #sparksvslynx
@Mystreaux Shug Lynx about to win and party like it's 1999 in Minny! L.A. did themselves in tonight.
You picked it @AkiemBailum  I don't see @LA_Sparks having a chance in Minny.  Game 5 will be live though.  #WNBAFinals
Sims got the moves... she got the moves... #WNBAFinals
xfactor nope with a capital X Brunson XFACTOR for @minnesotalynx  #WNBA
Welp I said the fat lady was going to be singing tonight but instead  she has more time to work on her dance moves.  Game 5 #WNBAFinals https://t.co/GyXJkPP5xZ
@ChristyWScott51 lol
#CandaceParker will have to go in retirement playing defense...she's showing it all this series...
Take away  @Lucky_Lefty0  going left but she can go right on that 3pt line... ballin out... #WNBAFinals
If this game gets closer I have the popcorn on standby.. https://t.co/jilP5AhUqE
Luckylefty not so much going right. #wnba
I picked @LA_Sparks only because the chance is now, they don't want to go back to Minnesota. #WNBA
P like you're good @SylviaFowles go on back out there. lol
#Brunson XFactor tonight! #WNBA
@minnesotalynx out here reintroducing themselves. #wnba

@sparks turnovers are killing them  and @minnesotalynx are capitalizing off of them.. #WNBA
@AkiemBailum shouldn't have been a flagrant she just fell awkward.. Whalen went for the ball..pace has picked up but still in L.A 's favor
@Candace_Parker lol those nonverbals and yeah that should have been a foul on Brunson..
The @minnesotalynx can't run with @LA_Sparks  #WNBA
Oh maybe I can't see..
Hard foul but Whalen went for the ball. She went for the ball.  #playoffbasketball https://t.co/rkFVdYggnC

@WeGotGame2 @BSO @chjournalist Which is the billion dollar organization?
@WeGotGame2 @BSO @chjournalist No one knows but it doesn't matter they can issue out reprimands, suspensions at their leisure.  You know the rules.👀
I was just saying who is that oh that's Natasha Howard changed up the hair. Same game though..
@WashMystics @TheGreeneTurtle Love those #mysticfans
Nice hook shot from @SylviaFowles she's improved so much offensively.
Told y'all #EDD #WNBAPlayoffs
You know @LaChinaRobinson when you're the @wnba #mvp you can take 3.... #WNBAPlayoffs
In any case scenario #EDD has to understand her offense is her defense. When she's locked in no one can guard her. #WNBAPlayoffs
@BSO @chjournalist When you're working for an organization aren't you under obligation to follow the rules and guidelines set by that organization?

If this @nyliberty vs @WashMystics game gets close. not sure who will win. It could go either way. I chose LIbs with the edge.. home court
I hope @SZellous1 is good. She went out after that hard hit.. #WNBAPLAYOFFS
Where did she learn that from who coached her? https://t.co/4vtBk75kb3
@WashMystics coming back 2nd half knowing @De11eDonne can play much better. #WNBAPLAYOFFS
You can let the 1st half determine your whole game or change it 2nd half. #DianaTairasi to #Griner.. I think she listened.. #wnbaplayoffs

The last offensive set for @ConnecticutSun is why I didn't pick them to win.. Time and Score situations.. #MercAtSun #wnbaplayoffs
I ❤️ this game!
@Mocurrie25 bringing that vet leadership for @PhoenixMercury #MercAtSun  #wnbaplayoffa
That was a horrible call #thomas smiled on that one. One of the reasons #Griner hones in her aggressiveness. Bad calls.. #MercAtSun
Camille Little with a great kick out.. Smart offensive play..
Everyone's gameplan is to get #Griner away from the basket defensively. @PhoenixMercury gameplan is how to get her closer to it. #MercAtSun
So far #mercuryvssun we have a Big 3 versus a Big 2. @PhoenixMercury needs someone else to step up..#WNBAPlayoffs
❤️  @ConnecticutSun playing style. COY pro 🏀 offense at its finest..Must keep their feet on the gas to advance. #WNBAPlayoffs
#DianaTaurasi will have to carry @PhoenixMercury to a win &amp; get just a little more from #Griner finishing in the paint. #WNBAPlayoffs
@SherronShabazz Both of these players are ballers Jonquel just wants it more right now..
Definitely playing their style of basketball..and #Griner  is settling.. https://t.co/u2guyNTYxO

A small excerpt from my 📚 At The End of The Day available at https://t.co/Efs929CBqF https://t.co/skwJr7gxUl
I don't always pub my 📚 on here but #isiahthomas letter had me 💭 #tbt "Pro Sports is a business but I never thought it would happen to me.." https://t.co/lT9u67a5Ul
I had fun chalking it up with you, you and especially you about the #wnbaplayoffs you guys motivated me to bring my show back.Yesh! #wnba https://t.co/SzFgXDdTxU
Now did y'all see that cross court pass from @PhoenixMercury Diana Taurasi  out of the double to Mitchell for the 3pt dagger.  #MercVsStorm
Totally agree with @LaChinaRobinson take on @PhoenixMercury #Mitchell  tough and smart pt guard. #MercVsStorm
@seattlestorm Stewie  with the ouuuuuuuh ooouuuuhhh on the coast to coast drive.. #MercVsStorm
Keep doing you and being a leader.. https://t.co/97qz0D8Q6D
Dominating and name taking.. https://t.co/j24rhDLmkj
3 fouls may have thrown  DT off offensively but Griner has her back and is going hard in the paint .... #MercVsStorm
I don't know what he said but it ignited a fire under BG Brittney Griner that is..#MercVsStorm 😍 #WNBAplayoffs https://t.co/EmsOHNMaAo
Me Either it either goes through the net or it doesn't.. https://t.co/ZqDlV3wZhL
Yes me either so they still aren't being held accountable. So how has the replay helped. I just want to go back to the "Ball Don't Lie" days https://t.co/HjxwVbDQhB
How many officials have been fired since the replay has been instituted? https://t.co/HHgWix5K92

Nothing is fair.. the game was great without at the end of the day with or without it we still blame the refs... https://t.co/9UiW61R0Oy
@KC_K13FanPage @WNBA It's unfair to the talent level of the pros..
Bad thing in all of sports..not just the W still human judgment watching the replay.. https://t.co/RP5PJOqFj8

Look at Glory in the replay...I can't #smh
These girls better listen to Coach @tmmcwilliams
@DanielleKoonce Both teams are young lack leadership that's why the game can go either way.. I gave mystics the edge cuz they're at home.
Basketball is a game of runs. Who will get the last run? #MysticsWings  #WNBA
Yeah but she is getting her licks in, acting in her future but she's a baller though and undersized so has to use  it all. https://t.co/skZwD6bvs3
I'm loving @DallasWings getting Courtney Paris involved.  Paris goes hard in the paint and can pass. Simply basketball inside out.
In other news Happy Belated Bday @Beyonce I've been so busy this grinding working hard and being my own best friend just me myself and I..
Did I just see a close out on defense ahhhh sukie sukie #mystcs are trying to win.. #mysticsvswings #WNBAPlayoffs

@WNBAJones Definitely didn't need to lose that game tonight...
Wow #JewelLoyd with the 3pt dagger to tie the game. Makes up for the missed free throws.
Who wants it more.... https://t.co/BdOkSgnTvD
Great news @wnbachicagosky moving back to the city. Can you say Chi City! Had so much fun there.
@3PointPlayer True but also don't lose what you've always done great to improve upon other things. Players have to have a go to move.
