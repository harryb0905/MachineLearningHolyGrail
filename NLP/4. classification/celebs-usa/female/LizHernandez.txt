If you focus all your attention on the qualities you like or love about a person, your heart and mind will follow. It’s true for the opposite as well.

@iamnikkiraexo Your peace of mind deserves it.
My father’s work ethic &amp; duty to provide for his family has played a big role in my life. He never made an excuse for why something couldn’t get done or why it wasn’t possible. If I’m the average of the five people I spend the most time with, I need to hang out with my dad more.
When you don’t have control of your life, you can unconsciously try to control every detail outside of yourself to perfection to have the illusion of order.
I find that optimism is always the right choice for me.
It’s not what I do for a living that matters, it’s what I do while I’m living that does.
