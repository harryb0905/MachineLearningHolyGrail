Trump‚Äôs assault on our Constitution with his #FakeEmergency transcends partisan politics. If Republicans in Congress can‚Äôt muster up the will to defend the very essence of congressional authority enshrined in our Constitution, they have no business holding their seat.

4. In closing, I ask gun zealots this:  Don‚Äôt you want the country to be a safer place? For your loved ones? For your babies?  We only want regulation. We only want to ensure guns don‚Äôt get into the wrong hands. We only want to live in a country free of preventable gun violence.
3. But...there‚Äôs nothing in 2A that prevents sensible regulation.    That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre not ‚Äòpracticing‚Äô your constitutional right to bear arms w/ a pipe bomb or sarin gas or a Huey.    We the People get to decide how ‚Äòwell-regulated‚Äô you are.
2. My response to all of you 2Aers is this:   If you‚Äôre in the National Guard, you can carry an M16.  If you‚Äôre in your house defending your family, well, the Supreme Court said that‚Äôs OK too.   You have the right to bear arms.  BUT...AND IT IS A BIG FUCKING BUT...
1. Hey, 2A zealots!  Let‚Äôs talk about the 2nd Amendment for a second, shall we?  Gun lovers: ‚ÄúShut up, Melissa Alano, you haven‚Äôt been relevant since Who‚Äôs The Boss &amp; I‚Äôm just practicing my 2nd amendment rights. It‚Äôs my constitutional right to own guns. You can‚Äôt have my guns.‚Äù

5. Today, I want to thank the Parkland community and activists for all they‚Äôve been able to accomplish for our safety; for my kids safety. I appreciate you so very much.   I‚Äôm forever by your side in this fight.  I love you. (A lot).
4. As we remember the Parkland massacre let‚Äôs not forget, we can change the status quo. We can stop this obsession our country has with guns. It does not have to be this way.
3. Since Columbine there have been 231 school shootings, murdering 709 people - 231 of which were children.  The Parkland community said enough. They‚Äôve woken up every morning without their children, sisters, friends, and harnessed that collective pain into collective power.
2. The Parkland community fought for gun safety while being knocked down by those wishing to silence their pain. Let‚Äôs be clear, these were victims being further victimized.   Instead of retreating into darkness, they arrived into their light.   And I‚Äôve stood and watched in awe.
1. I didn‚Äôt know the Parkland community a year ago. None of us did. Actually, they didn‚Äôt know themselves to be who they are right now.   They‚Äôve fought tirelessly in the last year while trying to keep their heads above water. Gasping for air at times.   (A thread) https://t.co/zdWNNqILsm

@mattgaetz @fritzakakickass In my opinion not being in the constitution has perpetuated the idea that women are less than. And if we enshrine women in the constitution the laws that pertain to discrimination will not be subject to whatever direction the political wind may be blowing.
@mattgaetz @fritzakakickass Because if we are looking to the framers of the 14th; it was not meant to give women protection in the constitution. We didn‚Äôt even have the right to vote. Even Scalia has said the constitution does not outlaw sexual discrimination.

4. We describe immigrants as either victims or villains depending on our political ideology. The problem with this is that it‚Äôs void of any nuance.  A physical wall further calcifies this idea of ‚Äúus and them,‚Äù which goes against every thing we‚Äôve ever fought for as a nation.
3. We must give these people legal representation.   We also need more immigration judges. Currently there are only 750 judges for 750k cases which leaves immigrants waiting for years. Allow due process in a civil space for their stories to be told.
2. We also need more personnel on the ground.   And most importantly, we need a humane system to allow these human beings a safe path to seeking asylum and potential citizenship.
1. I think the message from the Democrats was clear last night.  Instead of wasting money on an archaic wall, let‚Äôs take that money and implement state of the art technology, a SmartWall if you will‚Äîincluding drones, cameras, fixed towers and sensors.

Every child in the United States of America, regardless of where they are born, deserves the right to a happy and healthy childhood. Demand this of our country. https://t.co/2V4Z3u1AhF
17. When I filed the FOIA I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd find. I hoped I would find answers. And to a certain extent, I guess I did. I found my worst nightmares realized...CHILDREN are being physically, mentally and sexually abused in our custody in the name of US Immigration.
16. You can also support groups like @ImmDef @VeraInstitute @RAICESTexas, and @AlOtroLado_Org. They are doing God‚Äôs work. Every day.   Donate money to help provide legal services to asylum seekers. https://t.co/lIfcYnuNCA
15. I need you to help me dismantle this system.  If you‚Äôre invested in private prisons‚Äîplease divest.  Elected officials who work with/take from private prisons: Vote them out.  Call your reps.  If there‚Äôs a detention center near you, go visit &amp; demand to be let in. Advocate.
14. This is but only one dark corner of the evil system of jailing babies. And this is just one facility company.   There are over 12,000 imprisoned children in the US as I type this.   Where else are these abuses happening?   Feeling rage yet?
13. Why are we allowing children who are already traumatized, separated from their parents, incarcerated, and thrown into the arms of a predator to be groped, sodomized, and scarred for the rest of their lives?  I REPEAT‚ÄîTHEY ARE CHILDREN. https://t.co/DqwQ8EHIkn
12. Also, records suggest MCSO didn‚Äôt fully investigate child abuse claims at SWK Migrant Center.   The reports show neither the Southwest Key employees nor the minors involved were ever interviewed by law enforcement. https://t.co/rkbkx2fz5J
11. Since this letter, one of SWK's facilities has closed. Why? Because of *yet another* allegation of sexual abuse. And this time not by AZDHS, but by the US Dept of Health and Human Services (DHHS). AZDHS had already moved to revoke the licenses of all 13 SWK facilities.
10. AZ Dept of Health Services director Dr. Cara Christ wrote a scathing letter to SWK, shared here. Dr. Christ minced no words, telling SWK the report it provided "demonstrates your organization's inability and unwillingness to comprehend Arizona's most basic licensure laws.‚Äù https://t.co/OhygX4wu9H
9. Biggest problem? Employees didn't have a criminal background check completed. What kind of childcare facility can't be bothered to see if an employee is a sex offender? I'll tell you: one that doesn't care.  That's really what these documents show: No one cared.
8. But what prompted the hundreds of hours of investigation were allegations of vile sexual abuse.   On Sept 7 a SWK worker who was HIV+, was convicted of 10 counts of sex acts against the children he was tasked to "care" for.   Reread the last sentence.https://t.co/SG3wOXwW8A
7. SWK's mission statement is "opening doors to opportunity so individuals can achieve their dreams."   Dreams or nightmares? You decide.   Out of 13 SWK facilities in Arizona, 10 were found to have serious deficiencies. https://t.co/d1TauRJbMs
6. Their CEO, Juan Sanchez, has made millions off this manmade crisis, profiteering off of the incarceration of children.  Simply put, our government awards contracts to jail babies using our money to subsidize. https://t.co/YnJpyrqFHl
5. SWK enjoys tax-free nonprofit status, and was paid $458 million of our tax dollars in FY2018, and $1.7B over the past decade.   That's one private detention company ‚Äì not including companies like CoreCivic or Geo Group. That's billions more tax dollars. https://t.co/5WKv3t1cMB
4. In August, Arizona moved to revoke the licenses of all 13 centers in the state.  This. Has. To. Stop. I‚Äôm sick. I feel rage.   These are CHILDREN. How can we allow this to happen in our name?
3. Southwest Key Programs (SWK) maintains facilities to jail children.   In June, Senator Merkeley (D-OR) tried to enter a facility and was turned away. SWK called the cops on him. https://t.co/2fLl3015nd
2. I am livid. And you should be, too. Ask yourself what kind of country allows children to be not only abused, slapped around, and dragged, but preyed on by violent sexual predators.  Here‚Äôs some video of that happening. (Warning: hard to watch) https://t.co/9WBDytnTYf

Incoming chairman @LindseyGrahamSC, this is on you. With the power of the gavel comes great responsibly. Will you call McAleenan back to testify in January to get us these answers? Will you call Kirstjen Nielsen?   Americans are watching.  History is watching.  #JusticeForJakelin
Answering these questions about Jakelin‚Äôs death, and many other questions about this tragedy, MUST be the first order of business for @senjudiciary in the new Congress.   #JusticeForJakelin
WE NEED ANSWERS:   Did McAleenan know about Jakelin‚Äôs death when he testified to Congress?   Did Nielsen know?   Was a decision made to conceal this from Congress?   DHS won‚Äôt say. https://t.co/owefErDu40  #JusticeforJakelin
This past Tuesday, days after Jakelin‚Äôs death but before it was reported, @CBP Commissioner McAleenan testified at a Senate oversight hearing on migration and border security.   He never mentioned Jakelin.   Not once.  #JusticeForJakelin
DHS Secretary Nielsen blames Jakelin‚Äôs family for her death, but reports today show that Border Patrol failed to give her medical treatment for 90 minutes after her father reported symptoms to CBP officials.   An hour and a half.   Just imagine her suffering.  #JusticeForJakelin
I have questions. A lot of questions.   Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin is her name.   She was seven years old.   Jakelin was in Border Patrol custody when she died last week of dehydration and cardiac arrest.  #JusticeforJakelin   (THREAD) https://t.co/MMtfQj8IMU

As someone who suffers from mental illness, I understand the need for better mental health care. But on behalf of those of us who suffer, please don‚Äôt say gun violence is solely because of mental illness when 95% of gun crime is actually unrelated to mental illness. #NoRA
More than 18% of Americans suffer from mental illness, yet less than 5% of gun homicides are related to mental illness. https://t.co/7R1Tfj3RPm  Mass shooters show signs of mental illness but the MAJORITY of shootings are not mass shootings.  #NoRA  https://t.co/walk3rC80f
Less than 3% to 5% of US crimes involve people with mental illness, and the percentages of crimes that involve guns are lower than the national average for persons not diagnosed with mental illness. #NoRA
If you believe that only ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù is the cause of America‚Äôs gun problem, you‚Äôre wrong.  We 100% need comprehensive mental health care for everyone.  But we also need gun laws that will fix gun violence in this country‚Äîwhich is vastly not related to mental health. #NoRA

@ggreenwald Hello, Glenn. I‚Äôm sure you mean well by this comment.

@Jim_S_Jersey You can listen to whomever you‚Äôd like. Just , that I don‚Äôt campaign because I‚Äôm a celebrity. I campaign because I‚Äôm a normal citizen who cares about humanity and the struggles we face in this country.
@MurtiMohini Look up your favorite celebrity.  Tell me where they were born and raised. Tell me what they overcame to be where they are.
@Kastanipuu1 All achieved after I began acting. My dad worked in insurance and my mom lost her store in a fire after I was born.

The voter suppression we are seeing today makes crystal clear that a robust VRA is as important now as ever. Congress can and should restore the Act to full force and effect. And the Roberts Court should reckon with the egregious and shortsighted mistake it made in Shelby County.
Shelby was also an incredibly activist decision (Republicans love to decry judicial activism, so...ironic). A bare, partisan majority of the court struck down a near-unanimously passed act of Congress and disregarded its extensive factual findings about the need for a strong VRA
The Republicans true motive is clear: suppress the votes of low-income, youth, and minority voters who tend to support Democrats.   After Shelby County, Republicans again have free rein to do just that. And so they have. https://t.co/SNmDMD8QVP
Under the guise of preventing ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù (which experts say does not meaningfully exist), Republicans push for increasingly restrictive measures like Voter ID laws and aggressive voter roll purges.
Republicans have long embraced voter suppression as a winning political strategy. https://t.co/jPFjFddI96
Immediately after Shelby, many of the jurisdictions formerly subject to DOJ preclearance used their new-found freedom to pass the same bullshit discriminatory voting laws that the VRA so effectively guarded against.
They said the formula by which the covered jurisdictions were chosen was outdated and unconstitutional: the world had changed &amp; the preclearace requirement was no longer justified by the need to protect against discrimination.  Clearly, they were gravely wrong about that. https://t.co/GXqltJlPku
But in 2013, in the 5-4 Shelby County v. Holder decision, John Roberts and the Republican appointees to the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act by killing preclearance.   (Another reason Supreme Court justices are so important.)
The Voting Rights Act worked. And it was reauthorized repeatedly by Congress with huge, near-unanimous bipartisan majorities.
The most important piece of the Voting Rights Act was that specific jurisdictions w/ histories of discrimination needed to ‚Äúpreclear‚Äù any changes to voting laws. Every time they made a voting change, DOJ would review to see if it was discriminatory &amp; approve or reject the change. https://t.co/bYfeP6O1r5
Let‚Äôs talk voter suppression.   There was a huge, watershed law passed in 1965 to protect against historic voter discrimination by (mostly) southern states.   The Voting Rights Act was a crowning achievement of the civil rights era.   (Thread) https://t.co/un7EadT55R

ENOUGH BEING SAD.   LET‚ÄôS GET TO WORK!!  There are six Republican incumbents running for Senate re-election.    All six of them voted to confirm Kavanaugh.   Here's how to support their opponents (THREAD): https://t.co/jsVll0Fv0T
TUNE IN NOTICE: I will be on @MeetThePress tomorrow (Sunday). https://t.co/zPofn00s2s
In conclusion:   People should be fucking terrified and outraged. I sure as hell am.   We need to take back our power by taking back the Senate and the House in November. It is the only way out of this mess.
They won‚Äôt be able to provide that check if we let them capture the courts. This goes far beyond the Supreme Court.   Kavanaugh made big news, but stacking our lower courts with fringe right operatives has been Mitch McConnell‚Äôs absolute #1 priority since trump‚Äôs election.
Kavanaugh is the 69th judge trump has confirmed. That‚Äôs an absolutely insane number. This is all happening quietly and no one is realizing it.  We‚Äôve all seen how important the courts have been in stopping trump‚Äôs most hateful and harmful policies.
THE SENATE IS VITAL. We are focused on the House, and rightly so. But only the senate votes on judges - that goes for lower courts too. So if they keep the senate, even if we win the house, McConnell‚Äôs judge machine keeps on cranking.
Kavanaugh moves it much, much further to the right. It has completely lost touch with the values of majority of Americans. And now its legitimacy is shot.
The Roberts Court was already incredibly partisan. It‚Äôs the most pro-corporate, right-wing Supreme Court in history, handing down over 70 partisan 5-4 decisions in the last decade.
What‚Äôs happened today is the culmination of a 30+ year plan to capture the federal judiciary and use our courts to line their pockets and suppress the will of the people.
That they supported Kavanaugh despite his obvious and disqualifying flaws - temperament, dishonesty, rabid partisanship, credible accusations of sexual assault - speaks to how beholden they are to these special interest powers, and how critical the Court is in their plan.
They picked Kavanaugh because they know he is a reliable vote; he is a lifelong foot soldier for these interests, a political operative who became one of the most partisan ideological judges in the country.
My thoughts on this sad day for America (a thread):  Right-wing &amp; corporate special interests selected this nominee and propped up his nomination with tens of millions of dollars in dark money.   We need to prioritize protecting our courts, which starts with retaking the Senate.

I am available to speak further should you wish to discuss. I am currently REDACTED and will be in REDACTED.   In confidence, REDACTED.
It is upsetting to discuss sexual assault and its repercussions, yet I felt guilty and compelled as a citizen about the idea of not saying anything.
I have received medical treatment regarding the assault. On July 6 I notified my local government representative to ask them how to proceed with sharing this information .
I have not knowingly seen Kavanaugh since the assault. I did see REDACTED once at the REDACTED where he was extremely uncomfortable seeing me.
Both loudly stumbled down the stair well at which point other persons at the house were talking with them. I exited the bathroom, ran outside of the house and went home.
After a few attempts to get away, I was able to take this opportune moment to get up and run across to a hallway bathroom. I locked the bathroom door behind me.
From across the room a very drunken REDACTED said mixed words to Kavanaugh ranging from "go for it" to "stop."   At one point when REDACTED jumped onto the bed the weight on me was substantial. The pile toppled, and the two scrapped with each other.
Kavanaugh was on top of me while laughing with REDACTED, who periodically jumped onto Kavanaugh. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state. With Kavanaugh's hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.
Kavanaugh physically pushed me into a bedroom as I was headed for a bathroom up a short stair well from the living room. They locked the door and played loud music precluding any successful attempt to yell for help.
The assault occurred in a suburban Maryland area home at a gathering that included me and four others.
Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted me during high school in the early 1980's. He conducted these acts with the assistance of REDACTED.  Both were one to two years older than me and students at a local private school.
I am writing with information relevant in evaluating the current nominee to the Supreme Court. As a constituent, I expect that you will maintain this as confidential until we have further opportunity to speak.
July 30 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Senator Dianne Feinstein   Dear Senator Feinstein;  (Thread)

Children do not belong behind bars. Replacing family separation with family incarceration will only subject children to more trauma and abuse.   #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
This attempt by the administration to manipulate the rules is nothing more than a ploy to further abuse and traumatize immigrant children and violate their human rights. #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
The regulations themselves cite family detention as an ‚Äúeffective enforcement tool‚Äù -- a clear admission that the Administration is focused not on protecting the basic safety and health of children under Flores but on carrying out draconian punishments on asylum-seeking families.
Moreover, many children will face this alone, without the help of a lawyer, as there is no appointed counsel for children in deportation proceedings.   #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
This subjects children to harsh questioning by DHS at nearly any encounter with immigration officials, including at the moment of requesting asylum.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
The proposed rule also allows both DHS &amp; ORR to reevaluate whether a child is unaccompanied even after a child's case has begun--a move that could strip children of critical child-appropriate protections and procedures, and frustrate access to due process&amp;humanitarian protection.
Eliminating the Flores Settlement is an attempt to end court oversight of the administration‚Äôs treatment of immigration children and prevent independent monitoring of the detention facilities.   #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
This is not the time to allow DHS, the agency responsible for the abuse and separation of children, to regulate itself.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
Eliminating the Flores Settlement is an attempt to end court oversight of the administration‚Äôs treatment of immigration children and prevent independent monitoring of the detention facilities.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
The judge also ordered an independent monitor to review alleged abuses at other child detention centers along the border.   #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
In July, a federal judge ordered the Trump Administration to remove children from a detention center that was using psychotropic drugs as a ‚Äúchemical straitjacket‚Äù -- just one example of the torture children experience in detention.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
At the Karnes family detention center in Texas, which incarcerates recently reunited families, authorities intentionally recreated trauma for children by tearing them away from their parents again to punish parents for protesting inhumane treatment.
The Administration is failing to protect children even with the Flores standard in place. Children suffer cruel &amp; abusive treatment in detention facilities, including family detention facilities, where they have been starved, taunted, physically assaulted @ forced to strip naked.
DHS‚Äôs own advisors recommended that DHS should discontinue &amp; ‚Äúdetention is generally neither appropriate nor necessary for families - and that detention the separation of families for purposes of immigration enforcement or management are never in the best interest of children.‚Äù
Simply put, this attempt by the Trump administration to destroy Flores should not move forward.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
These rules fail to meet the legal requirements established in the Flores Settlement agreement, which requires that all children be treated with "dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors."   #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
This Administration ripped children out of their parents arms to intentionally torment and traumatize them. Allowing them to set the standard of care for immigrant children is like letting the fox guard the henhouse.  #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
The proposed regulations allow DHS to jail children indefinitely while DHS ‚Äúself-certifies‚Äù that the jails are safe. This is a power grab by an agency that cannot be trusted, as DHS has proved itself unable or unwilling to ensure the basic safety and health of people it jails.
The Administration is attempting to dismantle the Flores standards of protection that have been in place for decades.   #FamiliesBelongTogetherANDFree
The number one priority of the Flores Settlement Agreement is that children not be incarcerated. This foundational principle, which the government agreed to in the settlement, recognizes that the best way to ensure a child‚Äôs wellbeing is to keep them out of jail.
To move this plan forward, the Trump Administration is trying to strip away existing  safeguards and protections for children through a new regulation to allow for the long-term imprisonment of children in facilities with well-documented abusive conditions.
Even as hundreds of separated children remain terrified &amp; alone in detention, the Trump Administration is moving to try &amp; replace family separation with indefinite family incarceration in an unacceptable bid to jail children indefinitely and subject them to more trauma and abuse.

I was getting ready to go to the Charmed set, in total fear and shock. It was the only day in our eight seasons that we shut down the set. We would commemorate the anniversary every year by bringing in bagpipe players at lunch break and have a moment of silence. #neverforget https://t.co/xjZU2f6tkv

It is legal to seek asylum.   We must create a fair process that respects all families and people‚Äôs basic rights.   When people move across the border, their human rights come with them.  Here‚Äôs Jackie and Raul‚Äôs story: https://t.co/G8qmcz5PqI
