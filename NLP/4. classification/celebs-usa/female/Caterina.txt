When asked to speak at first @TEDWomen, I said YES!!--if it's all women on stage, audience is half men, and conference is rebranded TED.

@jamesgallagher @nerdworldorder In a few weeks!
@mthology @hchamp YES. Also: Matt! So great to see you.
@hchamp Or, better, edit an existing tweet.
@hchamp it would be great to be able to block faulty retweets, for example. :-)
I strongly disagree with the proposed change to make @ username visible to all followers. @twitter @adam_messinger https://t.co/b66xnGVAbL
Let me clarify that tweet before it gets retweeted again!
@pkedrosky I can answer that. I've tried it without great success or appreciation.
@pkedrosky Perhaps femsplaining is more welcome?
@birsic @stevenbjohnson @jack When power user features are removed, it leads to their departure, and everyone follows.
@birsic @stevenbjohnson @jack Yes, but that it is an intrinsic part of use, esp for power users. This happened to Flickr, the dumbing down.
@stevenbjohnson @jack Even tweeting to 50 people at once? The possibilities for abuse are tremendous.
.@hchamp @twitter The potential for abuse is enormous the tools to counter it non-existent. This change should be accompanied by admin tools

But enough tweeting. Board meeting!
I'd been discouraged by social media but am starting a new company, a new blog, updating https://t.co/jTKYw3WGBd &amp; loving the internet again
@twitter @adam_messinger Ha now I see. There isn't a word for it I've always called them @ replies, even 1st ones. Sorry, mansplainers.
@jack @stevenbjohnson Even men get mansplained to sometimes. ;-)
@bryancampen @twitter So much you say here is true. Thanks for this. I will reply via email!
And now back to important stuff, like literature. My review of My Idea of Fun by Will Self, reposted here: https://t.co/DvEbGACMcN
@luca Thank you. Apology accepted!
@dangillmor yes! at your command!
@dangillmor i will build something for them.
@bryancampen @twitter exactly!
Oh my god if someone else tries to mansplain the Twitter announcement to me I will lose my mind. I can read.
This happened to Flickr. When features are dumbed down or eliminated, the power users leave, and everyone follows. @twitter
@stevenbjohnson @jack strongly agree!!
@joshelman again I am not talking about conversations or replies I am talking about single standalone tweets
@joshelman and would make a Twitter even more confusing if people @ reply to comments that have nothing to do with the prior conversation
@joshelman that is not actually doing the same thing
@joshelman these are not meant to be part of conversations or understood as part of conversations
@joshelman these are not conversations and they are not replies
@joshelman i'm talking about directing tweets to people who are following a specific user name, for example my company or another member
@joshelman as I mentioned in another thread that is not the use case I am talking about
@ozlubling @joshelman that is not how I understood it is going to work
@ozlubling @joshelman under the new rules?
@ozlubling @joshelman so are you saying that if you put a dot in front of someone's @ instead of appearing it will now not appear?
@ozlubling @twitter @adam_messinger i'm talking about single posts deliberately directed to followers of another account
@ozlubling @twitter @adam_messinger i'm not talking about replies.
@ozlubling @twitter @adam_messinger for example when I want to tweet as myself but address people likely to be following my company
@joshelman half a dozen...
@joshelman I have a dozen people have already tried to alert me to the fact!!
@joshelman yes everybody seems to think I don't understand that but it is that that I disagree with
@ozlubling @twitter @adam_messinger yes I understand that. It is the at first at reply going to everyone I disagree with.
@rafael_j yes I understand that and disagree with the first at tweet going to everyone
@luca @twitter @adam_messinger yes I understand that. It is the first tweet going to them that I strongly disagree with
And not to clutter their streams with things irrelevant to them.
It is an extremely effective way to use Twitter to address a sub-audience based on their following patterns and a way I can be considerate..
I strongly disagree with the proposed change to make at replies visible to all followers. @twitter @adam_messinger  https://t.co/b66xnGVAbL
