Having a hotel room would be a huge improvement and would be hard to say no to. Just having our cell phones available would make it more bearable. https://t.co/c2nCvFmcNC
Haha well it would be way more fun to do it with @ThatCoral and some other vets. But she’s right, they need to pay more https://t.co/oTi32fsLHN
Exactly! Lol https://t.co/8kmFUfJRC1
She is so beautiful.  Pregnancy def agrees with her! https://t.co/c3W4lhayE6
It for sure gives you a physical reaction! https://t.co/WUnmvAHUdT
Wow. Wow. Wow. I’m actually nauseous watching this right now. Incredible filming. I met @AlexHonnold in 2012 in Bishop, CA and watched him climb. He is unbelievable. I highly suggest watching this documentary! https://t.co/q9QcCivKQB
Thank you! He hated me but we did come in second place 🤩 https://t.co/ANOHPP1L0x
Yeah the majority of the people on the challenges are just terrible humans so it would take a lot of money for me to choose to live with awful people. https://t.co/03b0dGq2vi
I chose Holly bc she was the best competitor and I wanted to go home. I’ve done 4 challenges and 2 of them I quit and was miserable being there. I’m not even sorry about it https://t.co/Vx4hhwwcqu
😂 yes! https://t.co/23Il2e53OC
Kind of hard to take you seriously when your show has become nothing but a drinking game for the number of times people say “journey” 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/2Fmnh2IYqX
What 👏🏻 she 👏🏻 said 👏🏻 https://t.co/4Bj3THXHVc
DAD GOALS! This video made me tear up. I don’t have kids but it’s so awesome to see someone raise a future little badass girl! https://t.co/mg05bc3HrU
That’s what would make this so much worse. I hope there’s another explanation though https://t.co/mau1aCIPn5
Ah @JussieSmollett  I’ll still sit this one out and wait for the full truth to come out, but I’m going to be very disappointed as a fan of #EmpireFox &amp; #JussieSmollett if this whole thing was indeed a hoax 😕 https://t.co/PMtSgMd30a
Thank you for your bravery and service to everyone in our city. ❤️ https://t.co/5fmOAXzekB
Happy #LoveYourPetDay to my love Saint. You are the best buddy anyone could ask for and you make me smile everyday. Love you, buddy! https://t.co/tvlPyG0j9U

The comments on this thread 🤣 ⁦@amyschumer⁩ people in New Orleans don’t like you. I’m sure since you’re a comedian you can take it.  https://t.co/34lzAEPox7
Finally caught up on #CelebrityBigBrother finale. Congrats @TamarBraxtonHer so happy she won. Also not surprising my fav @tomgreenlive got America’s favorite! Thank you for an amazing season. Y’all were so fun to watch ❤️
😂 https://t.co/I39RAOpJls
How are we living in a world where someone only spends 15 years in prison for robbing and killing someone?! Even worse, a Holocaust survivor!  15 years is NOT a lengthy sentence. 🤯 https://t.co/NnSjFr6gbn
😍 New Orleans is a wonderful, beautiful, culturally rich city and you will love it. Just always be aware of your surroundings. https://t.co/gJ6U2iOOyS
@lolojones will probably win bc she’s a comp beast and great at the game. @TamarBraxtonHer has really surprised me though so personally I would like to see her win https://t.co/mQ31hez6Dh
💯 agree. But I did live in Montreal on and off for about 2 years and I always felt safe, never heard of crime, it was such a clean city. I couldn’t believe it coming from New Orleans lol. https://t.co/DC0tE39dNa
Big Brother??? https://t.co/bQ4ri8yTnh
Not too petty, but why would anyone in this city care about @AntDavis23 when he clearly hates it here? BYE boo boo, we don’t like you either 👋🏼 https://t.co/Ky8XNU4H46
And this is why Canada has relatively no crime. People are held to better standards and held accountable. You could rape someone in the US and serve no time or commit murder and serve 5 years. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/8XuyFJLtCe
@tomgreenlive made us cry catching up on @CBSBigBrother when he was talking about beating cancer. I really hope he gets another show after this. Such a funny dude ❤️ #TomGreen #CelebrityBigBrother2
Completely poor form to release this issue during #BlackHistoryMonth  I don’t understand how, with all the people making decisions at @esquire  not one person brought that up? 🤔😳 terrible look for them. https://t.co/hkeUJ4dQ9S
Abby Huntsman handles herself on @TheView with class, dignity, and maturity. It’s possible. Just not possible for this conservative in particular. If you watched everyday like I do, you would be shocked she still has a job. https://t.co/nEEbJ1DE60
I don’t think it has much to do with her as it does that she joined at a very heated political time. Also if you enjoy her on the show you are in the large minority. This format doesn’t agree with her, she’s too immature and self centered to share a table. https://t.co/PkIoDb0OCo
Another day another awkward moment on @TheView with Megan McCain. I’m actually starting to feel like @ABCNetwork are the bad people here keeping her in that contract. She looks miserable and is making the viewers hate her. Let her go! #TheView
@mayorcantrell can you please do something about the Dept of Safety and Permits not answering the phone or returning calls after several months? We have a rooster problem in the Irish Channel/Uptown area that needs to be addressed! Thank you!!

I used to fall asleep to this movie every night in college! I would say my all time too 3 movies https://t.co/ep22BqmYLa
And that’s fine! That’s their business and none of mine. I’m just sharing a go fund me for Kevin. Don’t kill the messenger y’all lol https://t.co/KyqrIS4B1v
Idk anything about that mess between the guys. I hope they work it out. I’m just sharing something for Kevin bc he was/is sick and if I had cancer and needed help, I would appreciate it as well. He has lots of fans. https://t.co/oPXZNc7aWI
Why do you guys care so much that someone who has or had cancer would want help? Is it really hurting any of you? I was asked by someone on Instagram to repost this bc he set this up for Kevin. I’m a Big Brother fan so I posted. Why are y’all so mad? https://t.co/KziF93MxpY
Lol are you guys for real? I did NOT start this gofund me. My name is nowhere on there and I don’t have time to do that anyway. I was posting on behalf of someone else. https://t.co/0Hog5WgaZ1

It’s unbelievably boring. Im on my phone the entire time. https://t.co/2padWm0dff
Ummm they need to raise the age on #TheBachelor to 25. This she said/she said crap is so immature and annoying. I feel like I’m watching junior high girls. It’s so boring! I would rather here Demi talk about how anyone older than 26 is geriatric
@NFL @nflcommish @NFLOfficiating  @espn The #WhoDatNation has spoken! Lowest rated #SuperBowlLIII  in almost a decade and lowest rated in #NewOrleans history. #BoycottSuperBowl #FIREGOODELL   https://t.co/nuFZXp3web
You are the real MVP 👏🏻❤️😂 https://t.co/4MTMCCvkx8
#BoycottBowl WAY more lit than #SuperBowl53 💛🖤 #WhoDat Can’t wait for @Saints next season! Thank you boys for an amazing year. https://t.co/Ska7qN8APK
Hahaha. Come on down and I’ll take you to the real deals in the French Quarter 😂 https://t.co/RUqK09wXNX
Scrolling through Twitter seeing literally everyone talk about how terrible/boring the #SuperBowl2019 and #PepsiHalftime show is. Looks like the Gris Gris worked! @Saints  @nflcommish #BoycottBowl #voodoo #Saints #SuperBowlFail @NFL #WhoDat #NOLA https://t.co/nIkOG38iWA
Bless you, @LouisianaGov 👏🏻 This is such a nice burn 🤣 https://t.co/2X2NhTSEjF
We don’t want a makeup call! We want a correct call! These refs are complete crap! https://t.co/al8AF6Cq18

Proud of my city for #BoycottBowl today! No one I know in #NewOrleans is watching #SuperBowl2019 today. I’m home sick but people are partying a few blocks down on Magazine St. celebrating our @Saints #BoycottSuperBowl #WhoDat https://t.co/iKmrgT2Y8V
Haha well thanks! My fashion choices were a bit suspect back then though https://t.co/5fWT8Ka1ab
No! What’s that? And why? lol https://t.co/da8dOuOjdf
Wow. I’m just catching up. She has a temper! https://t.co/xRbAlenJtw
That’s so cool ED! https://t.co/r440V8GIbG
God bless this person! I love to see stories like this about the good people in this country. #PolarVortex https://t.co/ZN6TwOkN4G
Love that pic!! Looks cold haha https://t.co/ZZH1maQmNG
Finally @nflcommish is forced to comment on the @Saints no call. “Technology is not going to solve all those issues. The game is not officiated by robots.” Uhhh 100% technology WOULD have solved that if you use replay. We would be in Atl right now 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/jE6FJhhEJl
Someone please give Megan McCain a very long one on one interview or a book deal so she doesn’t feel the need to hijack every single interview on #TheView to talk about herself and her family.
I did!! I don’t care what happened with her crooked ex husband, Tammy Faye was a lovely person and genuinely cares about everyone. ❤️ https://t.co/kjLrZT0T4W
Sending so much love to @EmpireFOX star @JussieSmollett  after this disgusting hate attack. We love you! I hope they catch these people and they go to prison for a long, long time. https://t.co/sVMLTO6aDd
🤣😂 https://t.co/uzip6vXQMA
@tomgreenlive if you guys love Tom and want to hear more coffee songs, hashtag #CBBTom to vote for him to stay in #CelebrityBigBrother https://t.co/BAdAo9IrbV
Demi is total trash but she’s smart enough to realize she will never be the next Bachelorette; however, she is good enough drama to be on BIP. She will collect about 250k Insta followers &amp; schlep tea &amp; gummy hair pills, making 6 figs for about 5 years or so https://t.co/A3n7VPjZGt
Is anyone else concerned as to why a hospital would turn a potential rape victim away, a college would only expel one student out of 3, and why a DA from a town would refuse to pursue charges in multiple drugging/rape cases w/ a witness? #TheBachelor #Caelynn
To me, it sounded like Kato used that as an excuse (about her child) and he felt more threatened bc the girls seemed closer and the guys were more divided. Probably more game play. They have to give reasons for nominations. He had none with her https://t.co/lo8LX5sJJ9
I 100% plan on trolling Demi on social media until her 31st birthday to remind her how close to the grave she is. #TheBachelor #Demiwilleventuallybe30 https://t.co/dqrsFi4loj
Oh! #TheBachelor  So many thoughts. Mostly that I cannot wait until Demi turns 26 years old and realizes she’s in her late 20’s and her life is completely over https://t.co/LVH7utkWV4
Also @RyanLochte “no heart no feelings” 🤔 nice sign off buddy! We liked watching you. Better luck swimming #CelebrityBigBrother
@lolojones with those fake ass #MTVChallenge tears. STOP girl. You’re hot AF, but no. 🤮 #CelebrityBigBrother
Most surprising cast members on #CelebrityBigBrother are Ricky Williams and @tomgreenlive they’re both playing an impressive game! Hoping @TamarBraxtonHer picks it up bc she’s my fav female. I want her to win a comp for confidence though
I see where you’re coming from for sure. But she has been very emotional so that might be why ppl thought she wanted to leave. I think she’s the most entertaining one there so I hope she stays! https://t.co/6VK2uJ3dVi
Yall. I love @TamarBraxtonHer but I really don’t think @Kato_Kaelin was attacking her as a mother or her child. Being removed from people you love on reality tv will make you paranoid and crazy.
@tomgreenlive is def my fav! His songs kill me 😍 https://t.co/c6vWjlslvN
Haha he sure does! https://t.co/Pd0UTP4Ujr
That sounds amazing! https://t.co/4QvhrIdoFl
🤣 I’m not even exaggerating a little. This actually happened lol https://t.co/izOkxhTNAY
Watching Ricky Williams sweat profusely while massaging @Kato_Kaelin ‘s colon is the strangest thing I’ve seen on #CelebrityBigBrother yet
Why would Natalie Eva (I think that’s her name) make a deal on the HOH this early when she was solid and she has so many people to protect? 🤔 #CelebrityBigBrother
Sweetest thing ever!! A dog’s favorite toy was ripped apart and the dog grandpa fixed him 😂❤️ this pic is too cute #puppies #DogsAreBetterThanPeople https://t.co/oF9G18NL3k
Thank you @BenjaminSWatson We all still deserve answers! @NFL @NFLOfficiating @nflcommish stop being cowardly and make a statement. People will not forget this and it’s not just going away. https://t.co/enGEVjWQt4

Omg he does!!! 😂 https://t.co/pK2s30orH7
Y’all this is a HUGE issue. If you travel, this affects you. My husband flies everyday for his job and I’m worried sick. Shame on BOTH sides of the govt for allowing it to get to this point &amp; not taking care of us. #EndTheShutdown #AirTrafficControllers  https://t.co/sjdVhvg5rh
Omg!!! Ricky is stirring that pot! Love it #CelebrityBigBrother
Med-rare, more to the rare side. 😎 https://t.co/LXebPCsK0N
She said “even destinys child couldn’t keep it together” 😳 #CelebrityBigBrother2
Gaaaaaaad I’m dying over her. She is perfect https://t.co/yVbtuTkJsF
Why is @lolojones so fine?! 💀💀💀💀
Okkk since I’ve been out of town I’m catching up on #CelebrityBigBrother so I’m on Ep 1 now. OMG. @Kassting if you did this...DAYUM!!! It is beyond. I’m so excited about this cast. They are already hilarious and even my husband is into it 👏🏻
Yes! In the gauntlet 1 it wasn’t about the money, we wanted everyone to remain a team. Dustin took awhile to warm up to me bc he felt like he would be betraying Nany since she left. I totally respect that. He’s a good dude. At least we did well https://t.co/jti8jn9YKm
How cool was @joerogan though?  I love that guy. https://t.co/ZCNkr2GYNZ
I loved the very first challenge I did,  Gauntlet, bc the ppl were so fun and everyone hung out together. I liked BOTS though bc I got 2nd place and won $ and was proud of how I did at the final. I liked the ppl on that one too actually! https://t.co/yiIcMwtet5
I am watching! Wow I didn’t get that at all, but she’s def cute (and a lot younger than me) 😂 so thank you! https://t.co/IVNBjfhlOY

He does have a point. He has always been a class act and taken the high road, but those refs have to make these calls. Several bad calls in that game https://t.co/2qC9h7j9A4
Same! https://t.co/mAwCyxysm0
@NFL @NFLOfficiating not making an official statement about the non-call yesterday is making people more outraged. Even if you defend the refs, say something. People are not going to forget this. I’m so pissed I refuse to watch SuperBowl #SuperBowlBoycott
Are you KIDDING me with this?!  @NFL DO BETTER #FireBillVinovich https://t.co/pWkWQ5V0SO
#SaintsvsRamsLive  @Saints https://t.co/Lm4gi4Kqld
On a more positive note about this game, #whistlemonster  😂  I always say our @Saints have the best fans and our city has the most diverse, amazing people. #nolaproud #WhoDat https://t.co/gdrryJrMqM
Keisha I CANT 🤯 https://t.co/TLD7bA51UZ
I mean yeah GL bc they did play a great game and made some ballsy moves after we did.l I’m just stunned still by this loss. https://t.co/2ppA3nV9ma
Hey are we going to talk about that BS non flag on the pass interference that they replayed about 6 times?! Those refs need to be FIRED. GL to the Rams, honestly, but that call was total crap. https://t.co/9Z7v1P48j3
And I am NOT mad at that at all 😍😂👏🏻 https://t.co/S3J3Gs9eKL

Also important to stir the pot then walk away 🤣 https://t.co/49ltPp9oCX
Yeah I suck at a lot of the strength stuff, but if I get to a final I can do well and to me that’s the most important. It’s where the money is. I do understand why people don’t want to drag someone there though. https://t.co/jEbrIJ8d1W

I just think that’s SO weird! https://t.co/LL8CRV0g35
Yeah it’s hard to get people in their 30’s to go away for a month or so and live with crazy people who might punch them in the face. That’s a hard sell. 🤣 https://t.co/WLw0cpk9o9
Lawd. Fake fighting Bahahahaha. I CANT! https://t.co/jueqnUwMhU
I don’t think it’s a bad thing to say it would take a lot of money for me to go back on a challenge. If you thought “you couldn’t pay me enough to live with that person” think about that x 35 haha. I only like probably a dozen people from the shows https://t.co/IX8CdipiXq
Eh. I would like Chiefs to win bc I’m sick of the Tom Brady hype. He already has amazing hair and a supermodel wife. He can’t have EVERYTHING 🤣 https://t.co/lD4xDvjNLy

Thank you!! ❤️❤️ https://t.co/mkQ3RX2IYx
She is the sweetest! https://t.co/7PS0Ts4NVB
I haven’t watched the challenge since the season before the last one I did. So a LONG time ago. I always think the biggest mistake on competition shows are showmances. Also not taking 15 extra min to put on a little makeup and fix your hair 💁🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/ewNNnVzCdr
Oh for me it’s about the money. I don’t do anything for pennies. Made that mistake in the past and never again. https://t.co/GygnOgOkbZ
Well some people are scared bc this is their life career, I just don’t care that much and that’s not the case for me. I respond to people on here and I don’t worry about it. I’m just saying I know my worth and what it will take for ME. https://t.co/biDaoCl8ae
I’m just answering questions. Don’t kill the messenger. And trust me, if I were concerned or thirsty to be asked, I wouldn’t be publicly saying I expect to be paid a lot lol. https://t.co/QZRaQNGBZV
Idk about anyone else but it would take a lot for me to go back. Especially to live with random people from shows I have never even heard of. Slim chance I’ll do another challenge unless I get $$$$ https://t.co/CvFMBCHg7R
They have a TON of great programming. It’s not the company as a whole, it’s the cast on the newer challenges that sucks. I always check to see who is on to see if it’s worth a watch and I just don’t think so recently. https://t.co/V9xfHX6FbJ
Normally I wouldn’t be offended by anything like this, but damn...this ad is pretty messed up. Completely missing the mark here, Avon 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/ur5jcL1hTJ

😊 https://t.co/MAczAt8DOy
Yeah I was more talking about the challenges in general. Who are all these people? 🤣 https://t.co/2ajOIufi5w
If they want me on a show, they need to pay me like I’ve done 13 years of TV on a dozen different networks 💁🏼‍♀️ If they want good tv, they need to pay instead of using recyclables who work for nothing. https://t.co/TdYmtuI6dq

Hot topic on #TheView today about when kids say “I hate you” to their parents. I only said it a few times, but my mom always responded with “GOOD. If you hate me, that means I’m doing my job” 😂 #savage

I get that being constantly hateful and claiming to believe in Jesus is hypocritical. But I don’t think expecting thousands of people coming here to do so legally is hateful. I think it’s reasonable. Just my opinion though. https://t.co/baLsuSk9BI

So you’re saying if you lived in a city that has shootings on a daily basis that you would open your door to any stranger?  If you would, you’re a better person than I am. I think Jesus would want me to be safe in this case lol https://t.co/1KYErZJkWi
See below response regarding this. Not every person is seeking asylum. Also they tear gassed people bc a group was trying to climb over illegally. A woman was just impaled (she lived thankfully) trying to climb the fence. It’s not legal to do that. https://t.co/5CA2E7v1WT
Not every person is an asylum seeker. That is why they are going through the process. I won’t open my door in New Orleans to any person who says they want to come inside because they are hungry.  In reality not everyone has good intentions. https://t.co/7DZIqkoJA5
I am a Christian, but I do not have the same beliefs as many extremists. I celebrate Christmas, but I also support protection at our borders. That doesn’t make me a hypocrite. It makes me a normal person with beliefs that aren’t black and white https://t.co/pw6CVafA5I
Agreed. Laws aren’t popular for everyone. I don’t agree with lots of them. I think pot should be legal everywhere, I think LGBTQ should have ALL equal rights. I don’t look for the news to tell me what I believe though. https://t.co/OSh0Z268Rc
Idk you should contact @ChrisCuomo to do a poll on that 🤣 https://t.co/pgO8BkcfGz
What does Christmas and the Bible have to do with anyone’s belief that the country should maintain order and law? People in the Bible used to marry their family members. Does this apply today? No. https://t.co/2ZxCAyEQGu
Again. Most people (from polls-and this is also how I feel) only want migrants to come here legally. The law doesn’t say if you traveled weeks with a baby, you get to come in here without doing so legally. How is that difficult to understand? https://t.co/U106aLpcjC
I’ve had 35 years of “reading up on Jesus”, since I could read actually.  I also don’t take the Bible literally and with time, comes change. Laws and regulations aren’t made because everyone obeys them. Everyone needs to go through the legal process. https://t.co/F2MIksz3x5
In some instances yes. But how fast can you process hoards of people at a time? Better to wait and do it legally. Also. Leave Christmas out of it. Celebrating a holiday doesn’t make you a hypocrite if you don’t agree with ppl coming here illegally https://t.co/Bj3e819N8E
This has happened at the border before under different administrations. I think the difference is Trump incites hate and lacks compassion so people are talking about it/news coverage. https://t.co/oWdH1YWlZ0
This wasn’t even a question back then and doesn’t pertain to anything we are dealing with now. Apples and oranges. Ask for asylum, come here legally. Do not try to rush the borders and cross illegally. https://t.co/oWdH1YWlZ0
Along the same lines as demonizing Santa &amp; the Rudolph cartoon, this genius thinks if you celebrate Christmas and you support lawful entry of the country, then you are a hypocrite 🤔 @ChrisCuomo the Xmas gift that keeps giving 😂 https://t.co/QarEg4QQMx
Most of the comments are hilarious but there are some that are super critical! It’s insane. I always took away from the cartoon that you can achieve anything despite what others say! https://t.co/QD0kJ17arR
Kills me that #RudolphTheRedNosedReindeer is trending bc people are upset at bullying in it. It takes a special kind of person to demonize Santa Claus. Y’all need to get a hobby or something 🤣
I don’t have kids but I agree with this! I know many parents who cannot enjoy dining out unless their small children are occupied. Nothing wrong with that. Let the parents live! https://t.co/3j4fcf2FBU
Awww. This is the real life story of Tom Hanks in The Terminal!  Glad he made it to Canada. Can you imagine living in an airport for months? 🤯 https://t.co/QbHHCg6KWn
I completely agree with you. I’m guessing this is why they don’t speak. 🤷🏼‍♀️ (and your meme was perfect 🤣) https://t.co/yOyQwcw4oJ
Boycotting a state because of a handful of corrupts will hurt good people who need those jobs. Just trust that the corrupts will eventually be found out and held accountable. So many amazing projects are filmed in Georgia, don’t punish the entire state. https://t.co/aGlBLKde5z
Say it LOUDER!! 👏🏻👏🏻 #GeauxSaints #blackandgoldinthesuperbowl @Saints https://t.co/Vcu1aiocVg

Right!! Yeah that’s the example I thought of! 🤔 https://t.co/beFokeLt04
Can’t you be arrested for shouting something like that in a crowded public area in order to create unnecessary panic? I thought I read that somewhere.  Either way this guy is a complete jerk. People are panicked enough. https://t.co/9hrfT5Tc84
If you are a GUY or know a GUY who is late 30’s to mid 40’s and has a JOB, good looking etc. please see below. My best friend is casting a show and you might be perfect for it! https://t.co/0AYF5gEOJu
Oh. My. Gosh. Wow. https://t.co/qttFCaXHCl
X #WhoDatNation @DezBryant we ❤️you https://t.co/tJGXbPQGcu
I don’t see either person at fault though. They were both doing what they were told or supposed to do. No one was hurt. People saying she assaulted him or he assaulted her seems ridiculous and solely based on political affiliations https://t.co/omgG4xraOm
First off. That is very cool! Secondly yeah, that seems like what a reasonable person would do. No telling what staff was told to do at this event. The girl looked nervous AF though. Trump didn’t have to answer the question but it should’ve been heard. https://t.co/MmhkWYg7pN
I get it. Like don’t hold a press conference if you don’t want to be asked questions https://t.co/l6orKMPPq9
Putting your hand down on someone’s arm that is above yours and pulling your body to tug an object away. Idk what you’d call that. Swat? She rudely tried to grab what he was holding as well. They both look ridiculous https://t.co/FgBpt91oXc
What I see is a stressed intern being a little aggressive probably scared she will get fired and a reporter trying to do his own job, swatting her away. Looks like two kids fighting over a toy to me. https://t.co/lalfT3VjGe
Comments are mixed under this video as well. https://t.co/CMA6s8fDmT
Doesn’t it say a lot about how blinded by politics people are when there is an actual video of an event, yet 2 completely different views of the video based on affiliation. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/k1MyLJ3C0B
No words. This shows how often these mass shootings are happening. Unbelievable. 👇🏽 https://t.co/GMkhK8phJG
Actually I try not to block unless someone says something way rude, which he didn’t. Sometimes I learn from people in disagreements 😊 https://t.co/NHOXEvpHOm
I understand. We do live in crazy times!  My anxiety level is off the charts every morning reading the news. 😬 wish you well too and I hope people start to unite after yesterday. https://t.co/qr5ihaHJTE
It was as horrific then as it is now. I also like to think we have come a long way since the 50’s and 60’s.  Everyone should have the right to be protected on their property and home. https://t.co/ZyonJMZTMw
Same. I don’t watch his show, but I can’t think of a single person in this world I would wish a mob outside their home screaming while their family is inside. Especially at night. That’s just scary. https://t.co/iaRE4DJSns
This looks like a scene out of The Purge. Wtf is happening with us when we target people at their home with their children sleeping there? I don’t care what this guy said on whatever show he’s on, terrorizing someone’s family is NOT ok 🙁 https://t.co/5G7zEOYeov
Hahahahaha. https://t.co/hA2b6u4eKF
I swear when Meghan McCain starts high pitched screaming over the other co-hosts on @TheView his ears start twitching 😂 #TheView https://t.co/OSNaBmCHbI

PREACH https://t.co/ziQ7kKIddg
Agreed. I’m all about comedy and impressions etc. but making fun of an injury or disability is uncool. Period. Personally I think it’s more uncool when that person was disabled fighting for the country. https://t.co/u4JCpw6LiQ
The “joke” wasn’t funny.  Making fun of someone’s appearance IS real if it fits what was said. The guy did injure his eye in combat, or as Pete says “in war or whatever”. It was in poor taste. Also I just never thought he was funny https://t.co/i3z8dmAa4G
100% and him making fun of someone who is disabled. So wrong. https://t.co/dO5OElnRAL
What racist ad? If they aired a racist ad, then of course they should apologize!  That’s crazy https://t.co/9wlcbMEpeD
I watched the entire segment. Trying to cover up a bad “joke” by making fun of yourself after doesn’t take back the crappy thing you said before. He needs to apologize. He’s also just not funny. No clue how he is even on @nbcsnl https://t.co/5ovf9E3whv
It was an unfunny joke about a vet who lost his eye during combat. He has no business making fun of anyone’s appearance.  The guy is complete trash https://t.co/2UEwENrJLf
Yeah I don’t get it. I never found him funny. I miss Will Ferrell and Mike Myers 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/juaOJIPuDg
Now that Ariana dumped him he can go back to being a non relevant cast member of a show that used to be funny. Hey, maybe he should do a challenge now! Or DWTS? https://t.co/ciXQBMHl1G
So horrible for their families. Y’all please be careful when you’re taking vacation pics. Damn. No one should be dying trying to get the perfect pic for Instagram. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/HpY0WA5hVG
So excited for this! Can’t wait to watch with my best little buddy, Saint https://t.co/pBS6OIZ9ci
These are amazing!!!! https://t.co/N5r0iKEnCa

@TiffanyHaddish on @TheView today is EVERYTHING. 😂 cannot wait for her comedy tour!

Haha aww. Thanks! I miss my @TheMarkLong https://t.co/hatmy7S9kh
I would die. It’s my favorite show! 😍 https://t.co/Gkv0HW4DpY
If it were the right show, I would do reality tv again. https://t.co/rg9Xi0x6qz
No they have not. I think they are filming season 2 here though. https://t.co/q788p4sEuL
When I was a baby until about 6 years old, my mom worked at Kmart and she loved it and the people she worked with. I met my first gay friend (my moms coworker, Mr Bill) from there too 🌈! Kmart will always be special to me ❤️ https://t.co/nXLx2P5i86

Idk why I’m so into this story. I also just happen to be in Hawaii right now so sort of wondering if I can meet this gecko ❤️ https://t.co/hPtsxHKTTb
I am so sorry for these people in the crash. I pray for you and your family right now. In God’s name I hope for peace. It doesn’t make sense for these friends to be taken. https://t.co/8l8xNuYAhf
Pleeeeease @Uber @Uber_Support I beg you, add a slide bar tab for ‘NO CONVERSATION’ on your #Uber App.  Sometimes people just don’t want to make small talk. For me, that’s all the time. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Prayers up for #NeironBall and his family that he gets better. I have had 3 surgeries on an #AVM near my spine, that is still there. It’s a scary thing, but very possible to overcome.  Get well, Neiron! https://t.co/D9Qo3lDwui
Finally watched the final episode of #Castaways and I cried so much! @RobbieRainbow1 you are an incredible man! We loved watching you grow on this season. Hope to see you on another show soon
Great. So now I can’t dress up as a Handmaid for Halloween because it’s tone deaf? Get off your crosses, people.
Dennis. Everyone loves you! This needs to happen 😍 https://t.co/6RT6rlIYms
YES!!!!! This has to happen! https://t.co/ybKXzLS9iI
Why would someone invite you to do that if you’re not a great skier?! 🤣 I would not do it. Avalanches, dying in the cold, breaking a leg...hard PASS https://t.co/bzrP6pAOmw
Just watched! Love the segment. Also loved seeing Emily and @BLEUaBlowdryBar ❤️ https://t.co/i6FITnGM2u
@RobbieRainbow1 idk if this is the real Robbie. But. If it is, we are still watching #Castaways #ABCCastaways and he is still our favorite guy! I love your story. I love the diary posts. I hope this show goes on. It’s about real people. I miss Eric though
I hope I never have to be in the position she is in, but idk if you just throw your husband and father of your kid under the bus. Even criminals have someone in their corner most of the time. This many women though 🤯 not good for him https://t.co/A9VGV4MZvv
Just watched @StormyDaniels on @TheView today and I am just so impressed by her poise, ability to laugh at herself, intelligence, and resilience. She is a tough cookie. I’m for sure reading her book!
Welp. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/FlxnteTBWd
You got this!! 💪🏽 https://t.co/IXPfVcfPvj

Let’s try this again lol. If you are following #HurricaneFlorence if you want a legit, reliable weather source follow Mike’s Weather Page on FB: https://t.co/bDZI97tFxg
Even with all this hate about #JulieChen on Twitter, I still hope to see her back hosting @CBSBigBrother for the remainder of this season ☹️ #BigBrother
I think some @Saints players went to the Mayors office yesterday to speak about this. It is ridiculous. It takes a lot for Louisiana politicians to respond to city violence &amp; formulate a plan, but they jump on this right away 🤔 https://t.co/ZEGUAyjy6s
Bahahahaha. That “hmm” after Hayleigh tells her everything. 💀 https://t.co/YeTFs8ScnN
This whole conversation is basically what marriage is like after a year 😂🤣 https://t.co/0r2112nv9U
Yeah I was wondering the same thing. I hope she stays and keeps her job separate from the allegations against him. https://t.co/IozJhg2HMJ
This is ridiculous and embarrassing. Personally, I’m an @UnderArmour girl, but mostly bc they gave us tons of awesome gear on #MTV challenges. This mayor needs to concentrate on fixing roads and fighting crime and not on this. 🙄 https://t.co/cZu0SUBvno
She legit scares me now https://t.co/6ZXzCOrmsQ
I can think of worse things than having overbearing parents. Like not having them at all? This episode seemed a lot like producers trying to get us to warm up to Angela bc she’s been so rude and bland https://t.co/rxPteWir5u
I love that Angela’s childhood trauma is that she had to spend too much time with her mom because of gymnastic practice 🙄 #BigBrother
I can’t believe I wasted an hour watching this #BigBrother episode. If we want to catch up with these people, we will follow them on Instagram. Stop shoving Paul in our faces @CBSBigBrother
No! I can’t. I am beyond hungover from 90’s night last night. I’m on my couch with makeup from last night and no bra and I don’t plan on leaving until tomorrow lol. But I’m watching! https://t.co/fMdqmGOI8b
About the #CardiB #NickiMinaj fight. I’ll just leave this here my tweet about Nicki old school VMA. This is legit what I saw happen. https://t.co/j5cA8qsYeZ
Well thank you! I have to catch up on the challenge though so I can have a solid opinion and knowledge about it. But that was such a fun podcast to do. They are such great hosts so it was easy! I could’ve talked for 2 more hours. 😂 https://t.co/ylgevtnmId
I think whomever was working at @Qantas that day deserves a raise for having to deal with ridiculous, high on their horse, divas, like MISS O’Dwyer. Somehow 8 years at University didn’t teach you humbleness and tact. https://t.co/21tmAc7Ait

#BachelorInParadise rant: how does a girl who looks like Shushana pine over any guy?! I don’t get it. When I was in my mid-20’s I looked like a troll who drank too much beer and I still managed to have boyfriends. She is way too cute to beg! Confidence, girl!
Lol. He really does need to be slapped by a tiny woman. https://t.co/Ka6bXa8eaS
Right?! That’s like Contagion stuff right there terrifying. https://t.co/83dRBjxPFh
Hahaha I plan on it! I just know that once I start I won’t see the sun again until I’m done with every episode. Need to time manage on this one 😊 https://t.co/xD2cRJRjcS
This is my worst nightmare 🤢 https://t.co/WaWxZz9Ir3
How do we feel about #AbbyHuntsman joining @TheView ? I don’t watch Fox, so I don’t know much about her, but she did fine on the first show. Thoughts?
He sent her home by not giving her a rose, knowing that he took her off the market to begin with and that everyone else was a pair. https://t.co/Gk0iCzslQ7
Well tonight Eric is the one making me heated. He keeps talking about “Angela going home”. Ummm she didn’t ‘go home’ you SENT her home bc you wanted to play with all the girls instead of just one! 🤯 https://t.co/JRV542XxZq
For some reason I didn’t! But it seemed so weird and uncharacteristic of him based on his personality on Becca’s season. Now he just looks like a jerk. Everyone loves #GroceryStoreJoe ❤️ https://t.co/Y1cQZr15Dq
Tonight?! I’m lame. I’m in bed watching #BachelorInParadise 😬 to be fair, I flew in this afternoon from a trip so I’m tired. You should check out Magazine St too! https://t.co/kDKPvASJAN
It’s not bad right now so you might be ok. I LOVE the aquarium. You could still do swamp tour in rain I think. I would just get an umbrella and walk in the quarter with a cocktail in my hand in the rain :) https://t.co/Qi1WL3uBgQ
This is one of my favorite things on the internet so far this week 😂🤣 It totally looks like it belongs there! https://t.co/h9Tajld7jP
I know I’m late but catching up on #BachelorInParadise from last night. Eric did NOT just try to turn that shady situation around and blame it on Angela. Wow. WOW. That’s low brow.
Hurricane party! https://t.co/NkQJkT59ne
Hahahahahaha https://t.co/RCcvAVn8fj
Stay safe, gulf coast! I’m flying back to NOLA today to grab the doggie dog and hope the power doesn’t go out 😳 #Gordon https://t.co/Vj0l7L8cs0
Ok I just tweeted a lie. OF COURSE im going to watch #TheBachelor let’s be honest 😬
Pretty much https://t.co/Hw1GtnGTIg
I saw a clip of one of the two Toms (I think there are two) and he was wasted in Vegas and it was one of the most comical things I have seen ever. I watched the clip over and over lol. I need to see this show. https://t.co/1iGpEL8Drz
The thread is great! I’m so excited!! https://t.co/Jvj3vM1C6I
Sooo I have never watched a single episode of #VanderpumpRules and after reading this guy’s feed about it, I either never have to watch OR my next week will be completely blocked out ✌🏼guess what I choose 😬 https://t.co/b00cpNOSRb
Possibly. Idk. He was more Hollywood than the other guys were. They were all normal, fun guys. He was trying to be famous. And he did become famous. So good for him. I just didn’t like him. https://t.co/wt7JVnBxjX
What THE....no no no. Not even possible.  I’m calling BS on this. And if there is any proof I would absolutely love to see it. I met Brandon forever ago and he’s the kindest, most gentle, respectful man. https://t.co/tNXhGUG1u4
Spoke about what?? https://t.co/NJq2mYNehd
Actually. I only have met Johnny once. I didn’t consider him part of the Jackass crew that I traveled with. I actually didn’t like him. Thought he was an asshole. https://t.co/Wh23fVDJf1
Yes. They were the first crew I traveled internationally with. I’ve met all of them and filmed a bit with them. Great guys. All of them are good people. https://t.co/Wh23fVDJf1
Yes we have spoken briefly and I am so damn proud of him and happy that he has a good woman in his life!! https://t.co/snhZEcJV3z
We texted recently about going to see Irulan and her kids and hubby in New York. Frank and Riss are out there as well so I’ll probably do that soon. Hopefully with Brynn! https://t.co/xCxShFZmzf
Well. Somehow my cheeks are a little less fat and my hair is more blonde 😂 but everyone else looks amazing. Alton has always been a ridiculous physical specimen that I can’t explain. I think he was born with an 8-pack https://t.co/TzF3GUa4P4
Yes that’s true. My first challenge I did with Alton and Irulan, they had my back so much even if it was just emotional support. I can’t say I returned the favor for Alton on my later challenge though 😳 https://t.co/pxo4GMPKLT
We all left the season with so much love for each other. I actually missed them right when I got on the plane home. I’m not sure many seasons had the same feeling. https://t.co/Ui0AVkGtfD
Bahahahahaha. Yeah let’s go with that https://t.co/BRy6ktBXAf
I love this pic! If you can believe it, they all look exactly the same!!! Good genes ❤️ https://t.co/bPWngluSpU
I just realized how grammatically incorrect this tweet was 😬 https://t.co/4h3sGDpkUr
Possibly so. I disagree that this is something that deserves attention when they don’t report on so many things about the president that they should be. https://t.co/wGaUI07Xvu
I do! I texted with Irulan, @MissArissa  and Frank last week and I talk to Brynn pretty regularly. Also @StevenoftheHill and I give each other crap via text every once in awhile 😂 I only don’t speak to Alton. Not for any specific reason though. https://t.co/BYBBXU1XQK
It was clearly a low blow and publicly ridiculing him. I doubt he wanted to be featured on a national news publication. He’s doing his thing and working like normal people do. Then tying it in with Bill Cosby at the end. Mean spirited. https://t.co/rd8Ncn98c9
⁦@FoxNews⁩ you are garbage for even running this article. Seriously. What is wrong with you people? It must be a slow news day when you refuse to report on the scariest thing/person in our country.  https://t.co/It3MYTJMiK
YES!!! This. Life is a grind. No one should ridicule anyone for getting a paycheck where and how they can. https://t.co/l7vr3RVFLZ
And that is unfortunate because you would think people would not say things like that in everyday life. I’m completely shocked that people are quick to forget when JC said the n-word to Bayleigh. Unnecessary. https://t.co/JUUf5jfMmK
Man I love your honesty hahaha https://t.co/Z2eJ8DOgRP
I was not that mature when I was 21. I doubt I am that mature now 😬😂 https://t.co/7pzkNYbl6s
Damn!!! I’m shook. Can’t wait to start watching feeds bc I had no clue. They are very much painting her as the sweet girl who got a bad break bc of a guy. https://t.co/tymg4MBq0T
I had a feeling that was happening. He must know someone on the show because that doesn’t make any sense. He has gotten away with so much. https://t.co/gt0OPtrOpn
Ok so I haven’t had a chance to watch many live feeds (I will start this week). Am I missing something about Hayleigh being fake and immature? Because I feel the opposite about her. #BigBrother20 https://t.co/R64GTEgtT8
That makes sense. I’ll have to look at the morning feeds now lol https://t.co/EflJaCHi2B
Wait I didn’t notice that! Do they have to be up?  I bet production doesn’t like him very much. https://t.co/Q7DEodZd6W
Happy no work day! 😎 https://t.co/pCQ7pUAoMl
Yeah I was so happy Kaycee talked about it last night. You can tell she loves her family so much. Made me cry a little too. https://t.co/UQUVfvlwPB
Not to mention JC kissing Tyler’s arm &amp; rubbing him as he slept on the live feeds. It’s so creepy to do that while someone is asleep. Even more shady is him opening the door while Hayleigh is using the restroom and refusing to close it. I would’ve been livid https://t.co/GYmB2bGoNZ
Kaycee has been picking it up with the comps recently “Let’s GO!!!” 🤣 I love Tyler’s game. I want him to win. I way underestimated him in the beginning and I like being surprised. JC at first I thought was funny. Now he annoys me/thinks he runs the show. https://t.co/GYmB2bGoNZ
Love you girl!!! 😘 https://t.co/GB1Uw24Qdg
Meh. I have heard worse than tonight lol. This is nothing compared to when I did my first show. Words don’t normally affect me. Sometimes I choose to defend myself or explain my POV, but mostly I move on and never think of these people again 😬 https://t.co/kAXolD2JKg
Always @Saints fan! https://t.co/gFwpIb8gax

I’m 38-on reality tv from 2002-2013. During this time I have earned my first degree, was sponsored as a poker player and made a televised final table, have taken 2 more yrs of Chem/Bio and I am currently applying to PA-physicians assistant school. Your point? https://t.co/1BTlOmMqcd
I’m worried about math! Biology/Chem/English I think I’m okay! Haha https://t.co/rMcVw0p670

Diane nothing you have said to me was anything different or worse than the defense team said to/about me during court. I am completely unaffected by you &amp; will likely forget about you before dinner tonight. This is the last attention you will get from me✌🏼 https://t.co/dVCzMNXOUR
Lol have fun. The only thing I’m sorry about is giving virtual validation to 2 bored people on twitter. https://t.co/BXLyvUsD9o
Thank you! That film is amazing and apparently so close to the story, which I LOVE! She was such a bad ass! https://t.co/VRf4iZgBKf
Guys! Women’s rights here! Yay! We support women!!!! 😂🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/3hqKfV9Rqk
We see different things. That’s okay. Again. If Ariana speaks out &amp; says she was purposely groped and she believes that, then I will totally be on board with her. I do not believe every man is guilty. To me, this seemed harmless unless otherwise stated by her https://t.co/qlnzMqoSEG
Anne you can kindly stop following me. You came on here. You weren’t a blip on my radar before you tweeted. I simply disagree. That’s okay. I’m telling you what happened as a response to your tweet. Enjoy your day! https://t.co/qM44yU1Bic
You wouldn’t know if I did you a favor. There are many women who did you a favor that you possibly don’t realize. If you don’t get raped by this person, then, yeah. I did you a favor. And so on and so on. Think big picture here. https://t.co/4yKMNRMZkN
Diane. The only reason I haven’t banished you from here is because you continue to show how “women supporting women” can be false. You have name called me and said untrue things and I have not returned  the gesture. Good luck on your journey and life. 😘 https://t.co/lUIPZ8bRoS
Exactly. Some do not speak out. Which is why I did. I did that for you and the other women who chose not to. https://t.co/OFIzIh7AcP
Thank YOU! https://t.co/PiP4rxNQiD
No but name calling is https://t.co/GzWrBAIsaU
Well if Ariana speaks out and says she was sexually harassed then I will feel differently. So far that has not happened. It’s plausible that this was accidental https://t.co/QO5yizZet9
This will all be old news tomorrow. What will you do with yourself in between the twitter troll time until some other person is on video doing something you disapprove of?  I can’t wait to see what you will hate me for next. 😬😍😘 https://t.co/GBFJOFzX9T
That’s all in your head! I never called anyone who didn’t go to court inferior. If you feel that way, that is all on you. The fact that anyone would degrade me for standing up for myself and protecting other women is beyond me. https://t.co/n1OdfrVAu3
“If this is true” lol. I am so thankful some of you were not on the jury during this trial. Same people who would say “what were you wearing during this alleged rape” 🙄 https://t.co/piZCcvPPsd
Yes they were in court. They knew. Of course most moms want the best for their kids and I felt compassion for his parents because they didn’t raise their child to do those things. I can’t and wouldn’t hurt them more than they already are. https://t.co/WeqG2H1q7B
Putting him in jail is taking him out of the position to rape women. Having him registered as a sex offender flags him from places where he has the opportunity. Clearly you have not been in my position so you don’t actually know the ins and outs of it https://t.co/taVm4LOt51
Putting someone is prison and holding them accountable for their actions and having them register as a sex offended will so it. I don’t need to go on tv and hurt his family or drag him in public to hold him accountable https://t.co/HKjpxAur7A
Advocating for myself would have been accepting a deal or money in civil court. I did all of this quietly, without embarrassing his family and hurting them. I went to court solely so he wouldn’t do it again to another woman. https://t.co/Ld3K2opQKx
You are literally by this statement, are the reason why women are afraid to come forward. “Victim card” wow. https://t.co/Ld3K2opQKx
I don’t believe everyone is guilty! I refuse to be jaded by my own experience. I try to look at both sides. https://t.co/Cq7vdo2K3Q
Also. I accepted NO hush money. Had no monetary gain from this. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. Also a long trial that still is not over. So please do not say I don’t advocate for women. I did. And I do. https://t.co/2KocWzOqVE
You don’t know me at ALL. You know what I have done for women? I actually testified in my own rape trial when I was terrified to do it, only to help other women. So try again. You literally know nothing about me. https://t.co/2KocWzOqVE
Well I had a great grandmaw who would give huge, wet kisses to everyone she met and it made me feel uncomfortable. I don’t think her intent was to fondle me or the other grandkids https://t.co/hR2XSo9tQr
Here we go again. Shaming another woman for disagreeing. That helps. 🤷🏼‍♀️ You realize you can get a point across without baseless bashes on someone else, right? I saw it a different way. If Ariana speaks out &amp; says she was violated then I’ll go with that https://t.co/jU1Aw3p2A4
Of course I saw it. I wouldn’t comment on it if I hadn’t. I didn’t see it as intentional sexual harassment https://t.co/6rwbH1vLYN
Done with pre requisites, only need to take the GRE then apply to PA school starting in the Spring. I may do a little more school during the app process https://t.co/wvusFzVUBT
Just another jealous woman hater posing as someone who cares about other women. Hope you start to love yourself someday, Diane. ❤️ xx https://t.co/r93evkKILx
I know this is tough for some people, but logically, it wouldn’t make sense for anyone to sexually assault a famous singer on live, national tv, during a funeral. You guys are seriously too much 🤣 https://t.co/RiVLAgZ0r6
Well yeah and he apologized saying he didn’t realize he was grabbing her there. I mean. Let the guy live. https://t.co/8pJLNQarGb
Interesting how someone so concerned about women would call another woman an idiot for giving an opinion. 😂 you do yourself no favors, Diane. https://t.co/gsmlaDMj44
Right?! How stupid would someone be to purposefully grope the most famous  singer in the world right now on TV during a funeral. She’s sooo tiny I think he didn’t realize where his hand was. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/lKHAI5B6hj
Of course. Anyone is. Your next door neighbor who mows his grass weekly and seems like a good guy is. I just do not believe this man had ill intent and he already apologized if it seemed creepy. I don’t think he had a clue. https://t.co/NI9XPeuYUu
Lolll poor Rachel. Girl isn’t even there to defend herself 😬 I didn’t think Rachel was bad! She seemed like a sweet girl and her reaction to Angela’s goodbye message made me like her more. She was completely shocked and I felt bad for her. https://t.co/s2zUozLgoM
Angela LOVES her some Angela 😬 https://t.co/fo5OcAU3jQ
I have no clue who this girl is but she would probably win. There you go. Game over. https://t.co/EFYizxHFQm
Sorry but that is the weakest source you could ever give a woman like myself in this conversation.  But thank you. https://t.co/TR8qHu0bRJ
Idk but I’m sure she’s fine. She’s recently engaged, her new album is a hit, and she is beautiful and young and talented. I’m pretty sure this too shall pass 🤣 I just don’t think there was intent to make her uncomfortable. Maybe just a mis-grab 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/WdPF5sW65H
I was just talking about a gay man on @CBSBigBrother who literally was kissing on another guy on the show as he slept and this pastor is getting heat? Makes no sense to me. One is intentional and the other seems accidental. https://t.co/IjPo9Jz1z1
You can screenshot many pics that could look awkward. I don’t think the bad intent was there at all. This is all going way too damn far IMO https://t.co/EqkX3KSdZd
Come onnnnn. Groping?!  Idk where he’s from but that’s how we are in the south. My daddy hugs all of us and my girlfriends too. It’s not perverted unless you make it that way. https://t.co/OPcCZIcKW2
Omg lol this poor man. Did y’all really think this was disrespectful? He is a Bishop! He is a dad and seems like a good dude. I hope people are not dragging this man for being inappropriate. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/mww3bowKgm
Ok the fact that people are surprised to see Fessy during the battle back is exactly why all of them are in the jury house 🤦🏼‍♀️ #BigBrother20 @CBSBigBrother
Love you so much girl. I am NOT interesting enough for my own podcast but I am happy to be a guest haha ❤️ https://t.co/J7e76T0pbR
😍❤️ https://t.co/KjdO39anNs
Thanks girl! https://t.co/SrdahIInNg
Idk that’s messed up to me. What are your thoughts? https://t.co/Ydv0QCkTrr
Imagine if any other guy did that to any girl in the hohse https://t.co/ezY44KskNx
NOT ok. #BigBrother20 @CBSBigBrother https://t.co/jVv0eAskDU
Thank you! I don’t think I’m done with TV just yet 😊 https://t.co/jwd0teUhfF
BFF on twitter counts 😍 https://t.co/vpFSSwSKFy
Thank you!! https://t.co/xVHibDYIH4
Dayum!!! I bet she was pissed. Yeah it never goes over well when a man calls a woman a B lol https://t.co/LFoxRKQ9Qp
I didn’t see that! Did she do something mean to him? https://t.co/0I1alju7cO
Yay!! Would love to come back https://t.co/BSEUqfE9P7
WHAT 🤯 https://t.co/1MqlzaLJC9
A little mean but pretty funny 😬 https://t.co/NsblnGXrhE
🤣 https://t.co/n1cZHGivvD
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/zAOjcmeFL4
That’s so awesome! Haha https://t.co/lm3UoizQj4
I’m glad you liked! https://t.co/dd8naMvsT7
Thank you. And I’m jealous you were that young hahaha https://t.co/pVPCeKp1oM
Everyone is saying that! For sure I need to watch. https://t.co/pXB3XlQO0D
Hahahahahahaha https://t.co/gSy1PdMELA
Hahahaha. I LOVE that. She really is a mean lady lol https://t.co/IB6H9tMBFJ
Agree! https://t.co/UiZN9W97kY
Thanks girl! https://t.co/Hi8eua1drX
❤️ https://t.co/gC8PnbUb41
Thanks!! https://t.co/LkhNc5cZWb
NO ONE is perfect. Idk what happened between Miz and Kendall bc I was gone already (maybe gameplay? She wasn’t on his team) but he was always a gentleman when I was around. And he is a great partner in competition. https://t.co/zt051PuAwA
Yes that was a big part of why we won Fear Factor. We were broken up when we filmed and he was still a great partner and teammate. https://t.co/aUisfwPiyL
Oh you are right about that. I think there needs to be a zero tolerance policy for violence. I haven’t watched in probably 4-5 years but last show I was on, they claimed you would be sent home but it’s a lie. People slapped, hit, pushed etc and stayed. https://t.co/mCUhS4wclD
Hahaha. Imagine if they had booze all the time. No one would do anything except eat and drink and sleep 🤣 https://t.co/UZb6zKTdG0
I will watch the last few challenges and come back to chat. I feel bad I haven’t watched. https://t.co/mKVOxvlqp6
Well thank you!!! ❤️ https://t.co/xGLSCpjZUq
Yes! And yes! I was going to go on it in the past but it didn’t work. I have more time now so would love to. https://t.co/Vvqn1Eh2DD
Let’s be clear. I never said we can do exactly what men can do. I just believe women deserve more respect than CT and some of the other guys give. My example of Miz as a partner was that it is possible to be encouraging instead of degrading https://t.co/mAaiWyiwV9
Yeah you’re right. I try to follow the live feed updates on twitter but I really need to watch them https://t.co/I57bNVhKg3
Y’all have fun! https://t.co/J00MLAwKbx
That makes me feel ok but also crappy because she deserved better. Sarah is a good person. I think she knew why I left. https://t.co/Ilt1vR9Rk3
Hopefully @SHOTOFYAGER https://t.co/3nt3D2nTPC
Listen to @SHOTOFYAGER podcast!! https://t.co/QIkfwk85Cp
Yesssss https://t.co/0G0gmQYOj9
Agh. That’s hard. Elimination i think we would lose. Final challenge, 100% I am beating them. Any hard core days long final challenge I will win. But can I lift, bro? NO https://t.co/7guccu3Et8
To answer your question though. Yes. Sarah is a comp beast. She’s good at pretty much everything and it might have been a cake walk. Behind the scenes stuff made me not want to be there and also physical fights on shows, I’m not cool with https://t.co/agRy0IpBfe
I wasn’t thinking of Sarah to be honest. I was being selfish and I wanted to leave because of production reasons that I couldn’t control and a small part bc of Aneesa. I felt bad for Sarah but I couldn’t do it anymore at that point. https://t.co/agRy0IpBfe
Bahahahaha. Yesssss https://t.co/p1Mot9qYqX
Of course I remember my roommates! I miss them all the time. I do think Fessy is dumb in love and Angela, idk about her. I think she’s just super focused but bad move to make everyone mad in their goodbye notes https://t.co/HERw06No7S
Hahahahaha. That scene was so overplayed! If Brynn wanted to do some damage, she would have. She literally tossed the fork not aiming and it became this huge thing. 🤣 https://t.co/tnafvGRyDI
I understand what you’re saying. I thought what Sam said was a bit harsh though. It’s not like Hayleigh and Kaitlyn were making out in a hot tub with people 😬😬😬 they were just being flirty girls. I didn’t see much harm in it. https://t.co/QhSnULUUSb
SAME. I’m so envious of her youth 🤣😂 https://t.co/XOGdegQYRu
We forget though. She’s 21!!! Weren’t we all giggly flirts at 21? 🙋🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/2rpQnrcwAT
My fav show! https://t.co/0AtOxtcgvC
😬😬😬 https://t.co/MhRbfeB5bj
Yeah Angela and Tyler are my picks to win but I think possibly Angela would choose Kaycee over Tyler in the end bc of jury votes https://t.co/fXOunw0p2I
I am leaning towards that. She’s smokin hot and super comp beast so I do like that about her. https://t.co/me8kWk95gw
She’s proven herself as a competitor and I like that she’s not constantly crying and whining. I’m trying to figure out if she’s just super low key and snarky or she’s just a bitch with no personality. I can’t tell yet lol https://t.co/6y4PjFOZDI
Agh! So will there be a season 2? https://t.co/67o6PFJvwn
The smartest thing Fessy has said all season is that he’s stupid. Only took 2 months and almost his entire alliance gone for him to realize it. #BigBrother20
I really wish someone who was backdoored and bitter would just stand there giving everyone the middle finger until the door closed hahahahaha https://t.co/PJg7EtB3qa
We wondered that too! I haven’t spoken to him since so I’ll never know but I think mentally he was done with the game at that point. https://t.co/maV8kF2HXf
Honestly I preferred if Alton was gone at that point bc his personal game was terrible and I honestly thought Dustin and I could get first and could split between the two. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Selfish, I know, but it was my ideal situation https://t.co/i9cqvUPULQ
He is parched https://t.co/wxiDpJIb5L
Haha. Yeah! Those guys are adorable. Avril was sweet too. https://t.co/zBfIBvjCUj
Nany lived. Don’t be dramatic. Of course I’m not going to volunteer myself to go into an elimination. I knew I was going to do great in the final challenge. Why risk it? https://t.co/IEKdkLq1sW
Lol. Yes I was. We were friends with the guys from Simple Plan! I still love their music too. Met them on MTV spring break in Mexico https://t.co/B4Bo0MgRd5
Oh I’m sorry! Did we or did we not get second place with only 2 people in the end? We did NOT lose daily. We won a lot which is why we made it to the end. Did you even watch? I was responsible for ONE challenge loss. One. 👏🏼 https://t.co/GHdYsd1Y6j
YES lol but honestly I think it was an accident. Aneesa is not a mean person at heart. It was a misunderstanding between 2 drunk people https://t.co/cbulu9hcHo
Did a podcast talking about my fav show #bigbrother and my second fav show #BachelorInParadise with my girl @KateCasey ❤️ https://t.co/GKg9wwinQg
Least fav? These two are amazing competitors, but crap people: CT and Johnny whatever his last name is. I can’t stand douchebag bros and these 2 are the definition. https://t.co/OdSFwBGhfL
That’s an awesome question! 😊 https://t.co/Yv5wX0eEDS
Actually I will discuss that on @SHOTOFYAGER podcast. https://t.co/Eg2D1FiUZY
Thanks girl. Not my finest. Could have chosen kinder words lol https://t.co/dgFPeVCHp6
Oh I would be happy to be around people I love. That is ideal, but that’s not normally how challenges work lol. Also outside factors played into that. I got hurt bc of idiots on the show breaking glass in a pool and I was pissed about that https://t.co/HMmXVRA8iN
No. They haven’t. Not since I told the producer to go F himself. Apparently people don’t like that 🤷🏼‍♀️ I don’t blame them. I’m a little HM https://t.co/59my1sWsd9
You know what? Those people right there would actually get me back on a challenge https://t.co/vy107uUnii
They texted me that pic and I almost cried! I miss my fam! https://t.co/eTaLtK31b0
Hahahahahahaha. This is hilarious! Yes! https://t.co/8wF4w2JBgS
Oh, Scottie 🤦🏼‍♀️ poor baby. He is SO in love with Hayleigh. Also if Faysal says the “walks like a duck, quacks like a duck” thing again, I’m going to scream.  Did he just learn that saying or something? 🤮 #BigBrother20
He lost such a big opportunity his week and nothing he does or says  makes any sense. Love truly is blind lol https://t.co/trhueXRCUH
No but it looks terrifying!!! I can’t wait https://t.co/vPDgNre9sg
Can’t wait to root Jesse on! #geauxjesse #geauxsaints https://t.co/dc2gvpUouB
Yeah good to know. Almost everyone said The Meg is worth watching. Disappointed to hear about Slenderman though https://t.co/EVYBqDrudi
Right?!?! Aghhhh! https://t.co/MTguuckoTw
Oh that’s right!!! I will https://t.co/yfHH30QYaT
Hahahahaha. Def not expecting that. If you like shark movies, watch 47 Meters Down on Netflix. It’s a movie not series https://t.co/pupAPlc7MG
Already love it! Haha. https://t.co/ojSOj6jfq1
His wife is so great in all of those films too. And she’s hot too https://t.co/M0e6G4yK3S
Bahahaha. Yes. This was actually really fun to make. I’m a horrible actress 🤣 https://t.co/Gz4YjRRy3u
A few: Wolf Creek, Devil’s Rejects, Cabin Fever, all of Final Destinations and Saw movies, pretty much anything available on 99 cent horror category On Demand, and anything that starts off with “a group of college students go to a cabin in the woods” 😬 https://t.co/9A5oJeNPN2
Damn! I was afraid of that. Because it’s based on a true story I had high hopes on Slenderman https://t.co/rd82pzOu1F
Serious question. Has anyone seen The Meg or Slenderman? I’m a huge B/C Horror fan and I realize they always get terrible ratings, but it’s sort of my thing. Wondering if they’re actually worth watching.
Same. She is too much 🤣 https://t.co/uiCH0KZ6nU
Everyone says the challenge is so good this season so I need to watch. It’s just hard to find time and I feel guilty bc I watch too much tv as it is lol https://t.co/o4Imm32AaV
That speech was pretty brutal when she put the girls up lol. They didn’t do anything that any other girl does in the house. https://t.co/Pt60NquwDC
He was a great partner. He’s one of those people that is good at everything. https://t.co/oKypuPWqAf
Hahaha. Yeaaaah she’s losing it a little in the house https://t.co/YlQGx6396y
Sam telling Fessy to send his gf home is the weirdest thing ever. #BigBrother20
Hahahaha. Poor Craig https://t.co/UzuJaTgeKp
Oh I definitely noticed when Colin did it and I felt the same way then. But,  You are right that most people didn’t know about it until Trump acted like a crazy person about it. https://t.co/g1p7tPBBF6
Yes! I appreciate that! https://t.co/quYyMLRfYo
I agree that players should have the right to kneel, but I have hopes that they would choose a time to protest that doesn’t hurt or disrespect another group of people. I wish everyone would stand united. That’s my opinion and my hope. https://t.co/ktUiVaSV6W
I’ve seen this. It’s a beautiful speech. https://t.co/71Fkx5clNu
I’ve had this conversation a lot and I know not everyone agrees; however, every single military person I have asked in person has told me they prefer people pay respect during the anthem. It’s a few minutes of time and a large price to pay for some of them https://t.co/f6MCQRQyS5
He’s a good one. Always has great things to say. https://t.co/QvyQBnie71
That is actually funny. He might be, who knows lol https://t.co/ZKN7Ow6ZrW
Right, well if I want to pay respect to military and prefer people do the same, then automatically I am a Trump supporter and I don’t agree with the protests which is not at all the case. https://t.co/MYQZhqfghy
I am well aware of the “point”. I believe there are more tactful ways of getting the point across other than the 2 min time frame dedicated to pay respect to other people. https://t.co/S2ETy47jq8
No! Lol. Not at ALL. I cringe when I even see him on TV. https://t.co/KWmG9t86z5
You’re right, I don’t get to pick and choose. If it were my choice, man buns wouldn’t be a thing, Chicago wouldn’t have had 50 people shot in a week, and players would all stand united during the anthem. That’s just a hope though. https://t.co/jvkVbji7TP
I never said he couldn’t have an opinion. I actually forgot I followed him, saw his tweet and thought “wow. It’s funny how many poker players who don’t live in America love to complain about America” so I responded. I also stand by what I said https://t.co/jrASQQ7Wlw
I don’t support the current president. I didn’t vote for him and I completely agree with you https://t.co/NJtwXS3WGx
I understand your point but I believe there are certain time frames that shouldn’t be touched. Funerals/weddings for instance. People can protest as a right but you shouldn’t disrespect or disrupt those times, right? It’s called paying respect https://t.co/jBo0E5yvIq
Of course. But I don’t believe disrespecting other people to get a point across is the right thing to do. Players can kneel bc it’s a right, but I don’t like it done during the anthem and many other people feel the same way. https://t.co/HRE2bhf8dk
I agree. https://t.co/3WFCJXQF3u
🤣💀 https://t.co/P5SGiS9EGY
I love all this watermelon info. Hope this comes in handy for trivia night or @hqtrivia 😬 https://t.co/Bb5WgenUrj
I wouldn’t expect you to understand, EDM Squirrel  😂 I mean... you can’t make this stuff up. https://t.co/piCBTtxyXA
You’re incredibly arrogant, a little ignorant, and you have a large reach. That’s a scary trio. Living in Vegas 3 months a year doesn’t make you an expert on US politics and policies and being good at a card game doesn’t make you an expert on life. https://t.co/XBiLpV3gtL
I missed that! I can def see him and Kendall hitting it off though. Both quirky personalities. Both from LA. I like it. https://t.co/NhdYMVrteE
You are so misinformed. Also, this is pretty rich coming from a Canadian. You’re not American. You have never fought for the country like my husband has. When you fly a jet and drop bombs on the bad guys to protect people you don’t know, then let’s talk. https://t.co/Znhet5GgEY
Ok finally catching up on #BachelorInParadise ...is it just me or is Tia SO not in Colton’s wheelhouse? I just don’t see those two together. I see him with country club Barbie and her with old ex-rocker guy who was cool back in high school 🤷🏼‍♀️
Wait. Leo from #BachelorInParadise is a stunt man in LA?! Did we cover this on Bachelorette at all?
Oh yea. Julie was insane. Like how are you Mormon lol https://t.co/41r6ZoY9Cf
Haha. Well we did. To me she had valid points and in my drunk mind I did too. Coral is someone if you come to her with an issue, she tells it like it is and either you accept it/make up and move on or you can fight her, which I don’t suggest lol https://t.co/WVx3UEZwCc
@KatieCooley26 was my bridesmaid and I lived with her forever in LA. So yeah. I like her a bit 😊 and I love @ThatCoral she’s about as legit as they come and she’s fiery but she’s a loyal woman https://t.co/4Fkz09TYX1
I like Tina. https://t.co/PiPIVDYot1
Oh I like Landon! So I guess I don’t hate EVERYONE haha https://t.co/YMcadoJlcF
DM me but I won’t have much to comment on the show 😁 https://t.co/41rLuI2GkB
😬 only thing is I don’t watch the Challenge and I can’t stand almost every single person who are vets on the show lol. I don’t think I would be good on that podcast 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/EjnEgVWldx
He was in almost all the club scenes. Big promoter at all the clubs in Hollywood back in the day. https://t.co/3FuIQphPLB
Hahaha. Well I would def be the craziest, but I live in New Orleans now! (amazing reference to Stacey the bartender 💀😂) https://t.co/IUrJTmlMMp
Also only people who lived in LA in the days of Laguna Beach and #TheHills might get this, but I’m going to need a guest appearance from our fav club promoter Kevin Todd  😂 https://t.co/12K6hCbXup
I’m excited, but I’m also like...everyone except for Kristin had no personality, so now that they all have kids can we really expect more? 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/rSaO7CMbMP
Somewhere, JC’s boyfriend’s head is exploding 🤣 #BigBrother20 https://t.co/tdfBUiAGkA
“Be gentle” - coming from someone who verbally drug women who did a film with Weinstein after you accepted hush money from him.  Seriously, how dare you. Give people the same benefit you asked people to give you, man or woman. https://t.co/2miCHG4DoH
Yeah I’m not sure why everyone is allowing JC to slide from side to side and why Fessy trusts him so much when his votes haven’t been to his benefit https://t.co/YJC1E4dOPm
🤣😂 https://t.co/aVeK1weAES
Love on reality tv is a curse! 😂 https://t.co/HalsPZkljQ
They’ve been busting their ass to win and then screwing themselves over with bad decisions. It’s sooooo frustrating https://t.co/Zrnp0Sv8Ng
1000% agree. NONE of that move makes sense https://t.co/PmFbjckcTo
I don’t even feel sorry for Fessy and that side of the house anymore. It’s shocking how incredibly easy he is to manipulate and how unbelievably stupid he is. #BigBrother20 🤷🏼‍♀️
❤️ https://t.co/agAqciVAy0
Really?!?! Because your story is so inspiring and my husband and I love you so much. So proud of you. https://t.co/VCjjAboaQm
How pissed is Rockstar that she missed a glow stick comp? 😬 #BigBrother20
It’s so good! https://t.co/bfMBWP9YAB
🤣 really? It for sure makes me cry but I like it. https://t.co/pBSls300fr
I hope not. I actually like hearing about people’s backgrounds and lives. Survivor is great but more produced. I like this concept. Being alone can make someone crazy lol https://t.co/aP6OBOqVj0
Oh that’s sad. I actually like the editing and how they go back into the people’s lives. It makes me cry lol https://t.co/ePKRS2MOc4
Does anyone watch #Castaways on @ABCNetwork ? I just started and I’m hooked. Robbie the guy from Alabama is my favorite. He’s such a great soul. ❤️
We are obsessed! haha https://t.co/RBymzLrOWs
No Tyler is found out. I pick Angela or Scottie ftw https://t.co/wq0D1Fkhup
Yeah she has a good heart which is why I loved her so much from the start. She surprised me bc I thought she was country girl tough, but she’s pretty emotional. I want her to pick up her game. She needs to get a note from her mama to put her head right https://t.co/Lin5lWLyLd
He’s playing hard. I do actually like this cast as a whole though. I think they did an awesome job with the people. I had higher hopes for Sam and also Kaycee. I want Kaycee to do better and win more. She’s a football player! That’s awesome! https://t.co/IFLt5GSowB
I don’t know how I feel about Scottie to be honest. Maybe I should watch the live feeds to know more. The editing hasn’t shown him so much in the past 2 weeks. But Tyler is stealing the show and he’s doing well. https://t.co/1Ni8D9y1dN
Agree. 100% she would have. Sam is smart and she’s proven to win but she is hard to read and emotional. I thought Brett possibly if they could flip someone. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/ILUDUhcojj
Angela looks solid right now but you know how it changes https://t.co/NGifBWcWZX
Actually you’re right. That is my sane, 38 year old brain talking. When I was 21-25 I probably would have been just like Hayleigh 🤣 https://t.co/3xCFJmiBNG
I cried a bit on 2 challenges but mostly bc I wanted to be voted off early so I could go back to my normal life or production pissed me off lol. It wasn’t bc of people there. I always hated about 85% of the people there so I didn’t cry about that. https://t.co/CS9UYXtdk9
Omg the convo about the teeth on the curb thing and when JC said “that was really scary” hahahaha. 💀 https://t.co/7uTyrlY8kh
I used to watch live feeds but I ended up watching it so much I hated myself for it lol. Yes he’s an excellent flirter and it looks like Hayleigh is completely infatuated with him if I’m correct? https://t.co/IiiwoVnbHc
Girl it’s a mess with all the hacker stuff. But it’s Kaycee and Rockstar. Level 6 has the votes though. Hayleigh had a way better argument to keep Rockstar if she put up Brett but she didn’t want to piss off anyone else https://t.co/An7ZrX00S1
Who are you rooting for now? For me it changes almost every week 😂 https://t.co/7Kox2XA1a1
Haha my husband likes Brett but I cannot STAND him. His arrogance just makes my skin crawl. I get it he’s playing up for cameras and somewhat joking but he really thinks he’s so hot, but I would hard pass on him if I were 25 and single https://t.co/U94VRB2eBh
I really didn’t from the start. But I felt that way about Sam. I seriously cried when she was the robot and I thought she was going home but now I’m not loving her either. It’s the constant crying that gets me. I don’t like it for this game. https://t.co/hhmnEMxQmJ
You’re smoking hot and that has nothing to do with who took the pic!!! 🤣😍 https://t.co/K8UP7IFJud
Look. Rockstar and Brett couldn’t be more different and I dislike them equally. Not as people bc I don’t know them. Just as a huge #BigBrother20 fan. Right now I like Tyler and Hayleigh https://t.co/O93hafSfet
The only way she stays is to stop crying and be easy going and more likeable in the house. People already know Kaycee is a better competitor so if she stays quiet she has a chance to stay. Picking fights won’t help https://t.co/zTfbGSEQs3
No way! I’m just shocked at Rockstars approach to people in the game. She could use her weaknesses to her advantage to stay there instead of crying and picking fights. It’s just terrible game play. https://t.co/O93hafSfet
How did Hayleigh and Fessy think it’s a good idea to align with her. Newsflash: someone named Rockstar probably didn’t play many sports in high school and likely won’t win many comps. 🤣 https://t.co/vQn6sLeWCw
She might be the worst #bigbrother contestant in history for that move. Her best bet was dropping back down and letting Haleigh go heads up with Tyler. Then after she makes that pitiful mistake she cries again. 🙄  #bigbrother20 https://t.co/LwS2clhaUy
Rockstar. There’s so much I don’t love about her but the fact she’s showing her ass to Kaycee and has done nothing in the entire game makes me dislike her even more #bigbrother20
So frustrating to watch Sam cry and act paranoid I The #BigBrother20 house. Everyone knows that gets you sent home!
Ohhhh ok that makes sense. Yeah I sort of tune him out when he’s on screen lol https://t.co/YPwmDmckNC
Same. I don’t understand why Chris has “Goose” under his name. Is @ABCBachelorThe trying to be funny? Because it’s not. https://t.co/qHGB9kveyR
Omg YES! Nysha and Angela! I absolutely love when the “new” super hot chicks roll into #BachelorInParadise and make all the pseudo attractive “popular” girls like Tia super insecure. This is going to get amazing.
All of it! Lol. Her stylist must have a deep seeded hatred toward her, but I hold Becca personally accountable for looking in the mirror and willingly stepping out in public in some of those outfits. https://t.co/ooNx4VM3s1
Sorry for the day late tweets on #BachelorInParadise  I am just catching up. Did Kendall really just pretend she didn’t know who hot, Canadian Kevin is? STOP girl. She deserves a Razzie Award for that display. Also, she bugs me a lot. Such a know-it-all 🤮
Hahaha. I 100% agree with you! Blake deserves better lol https://t.co/sUbaXQWwNa
OMG. Finally! And with Morgan Freeman? I am beyond excited for this. #DisneysNutcracker https://t.co/R6B8QiiQNr
Hahaha. I’m team anyone who Becca sent home after the first 3 rose ceremonies. This girl needed a dating/life coach. She got rid of the best guys she will ever get in life right away and kept a flat-worlder 🙄🤔 https://t.co/COPSh2JvDs
Yeah Tia’s 3 minute air time outshined Becca’s entire season. I’m just done with all of these people though. They all bore me. Bring someone that people want to marry. Like a person with substance, personality and a real job. https://t.co/0LRZZBoohg
I feel like the Bachelor franchise are the worst of the reality tv leftover pool. They are SO scared to say anything about the current people or the show. Becca’s season was terrible. Her makeup &amp; outfits were God awful and her choices in men were even worse https://t.co/kQKONiAFis
Of course! Lol. I voluntarily quit the last challenge and told the producer to his face to “go F—- himself” yeah. I would say I let it go. It’s annoying when these Bachelor/ette alums can’t be real. Like how no one talks about how boring Becca’s season was 🤔 https://t.co/Rvh4rfq2kK
Gawd. Stop sucking on the #abc teet. Aren’t you happy?  Lawd girl. I let MTV go when I got married (legit married) . Maybe you should as well. 🤷🏼‍♀️ can you actually be real for a sec? https://t.co/ooeXMAFdaI
Look. I’m cool with facial pretty. But damn! Tia has a completely different face. Too much filler boo
😂🤣 https://t.co/MJwEEkCcWC
So did Arie. https://t.co/ZSFAAtp6SU
Oh I don’t really care about the social media stuff and I don’t think she does either, but I’m not buying the “happy couple” bit they did. The lip injections to me were the highlight of the past 3 hours. She looked really good. #TheBachelorette https://t.co/kGMtfBupYg
Well...Becca didn’t get Blake, but she got lip injections and she looks a lot  better. So there’s that. #silverlinings #TheBacheloretteFinale #TheBachelorette
Yeah, I’m very disappointed in this season, but I can’t not watch. I’m not crazy about any of them. The best one for me was #GroceryStoreJoe 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’m ready to move on to #BachelorInParadise already 😬 https://t.co/bduMfKJQMx
Does anyone know yet what Becca does for a living? Or what she does for fun/hobbies? I have been begrudgingly watching this girl for months and I know nothing about her. #TheBachelorette #TheBacheloretteFinale
That’s what I said! He basically said he chose his mom over his wife and he found out in only 2 months it “was never going to work” then divorced her. 🙄 #TheBachelorette #TheBacheloretteFinale https://t.co/0IdCGfEhoT
She’s been catty on the live feeds, pretending to be Rachel’s friend to her face and then talk about her behind her back. Typical competitive girl crap. Saying things about Rachel that are unnecessary/judgy. Her goodbye message showed her colors. https://t.co/mcmpUPNAh9
I think everyone underestimated Tyler and he’s starting to get found out. FOUTTE did a poor job trying to get Sam/JC to commit to their side. They’re being a little gameplay lazy https://t.co/BqW2mA7CMe
It pissed me off too!! 🤣 https://t.co/n67UdCVrr7
Agreed! I feel like she wanted Rachel gone because she was jealous that Rachel is hotter than she is lol https://t.co/9LQ5HXRNbJ
@LaToyaForNOLA “In the two-week period between July 18 and Aug. 2, https://t.co/8Au88Sjn5k | The Times-Picayune reported that 34 people were shot in the city, including four children. Seven of those people died from their wounds.” ...UNACCEPTABLE!
I loved her tonight bc she stands her ground and she knows who the targets are.  👏🏽 https://t.co/PJM5RgoEnY
Yes!! Love that about him.  Also he is a Bay fan.   @jillsteet05 knows too!! https://t.co/Pf8iAjBo4E
Baleigh- “I feel like I’m being put in a corner” My husband (quietly)- “nobody puts Baleigh in a corner”  😂🤣 #BigBrother20
Agreed! He is the absolute cutest! #GroceryStoreJoe https://t.co/k1xI8ok3dM
Honestly I think they wanted to humiliate us. As if we needed to do more to feel embarrassed 😂🤣 https://t.co/hdOAr8YYsP
That was so bad lol https://t.co/Vi7GznZZCi
#TheDeed two words #teamgleason
@Delta makes announcements to hold off on any type of nut for people with allergies. Which is what should have done with United ☹️ Hope she was ok! https://t.co/8qkT4qg0T8
I should be soon! I’ll let you know https://t.co/fq89wfGOGq
Hahaha YES https://t.co/m2zGtkEwiH
I don’t like either of the bros but Brett?! 🙄 I dislike him almost as much as I dislike Paul. Brett thinks he is so damn cool and he is corny AF.  #BigBrother20
It’s a beautifully written letter and I understand where he is coming from, but @Trevornoah is a funny dude and clearly making a joke. It’s not that serious lol https://t.co/UEcoe8B80l
Was anyone else kind of scared when @WhoopiGoldberg and @JudgeJeanine were going at it on #TheView today 😬😳
Hahahaha 👏🏻 https://t.co/FrcubMAMF7
Yeah maybe so! I used to think the guy she married was so hot 🤣 https://t.co/HGTMQinQsL
Muriel’s Wedding. I’m not sure if anyone else thinks this is a great movie but I looooove it https://t.co/91CV1mzufd
You blew it, dumbass. https://t.co/bnLfjFW6pn
There are terrible things in the media right now, but I remembered a man who made things seem tolerable and made the world seem kind. I hope y’all watch this... I think you’ll cry and laugh ❤️ Won't You Be My Neighbor? https://t.co/2wYF5T590H
Right?! Just for fun we put an old sidekick in our fireplace and it still worked after getting lit on fire. When I speak ill words about my iPhone it stops working 🤔 https://t.co/rFgfx8N7Vz
F you @beatsbydre and also F you @AppleSupport I am so done with issues and broken parts. Stop schlepping crap out until you fix the original issues. Damn I miss my @TMobile sidekick
I would want a cool name! Every time they say FOUTTE I cringe 🤮 https://t.co/bFxhNmMGiW
I was sweating you! You played so well. 👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/1naQAIVUy7
I would watch if I knew people on the FT!  I’ll care more about poker when I’m done with PA school :) https://t.co/Vif69YCVbm
I bet Swaggy C was more embarrassed that his alliance name was FOUTTE than embarrassed about being evicted. Especially when he heard the other alliance name was Level 6. It’s so easy to not come up with a stupid name. #BigBrother20 #SwaggyC
Bahahahahaha. TRUTH!! https://t.co/NUcGT1c4mu
Ok this crying Kaitlyn is doing is NOT doing her any favors. She looks unstable and like she can’t be unemotional when voting and that is not someone you want in your alliance #BigBrother #BB20
Miss you too!! 😘 they need you on @CBSBigBrother I would die haha https://t.co/SbJSx9jgtE
Right?! Totally straight faced too. She was clueless. 😂 https://t.co/6dArFrGzpA
How did they get her to say “I’m a fan of essential oils and the backdoor” 😂🤔 https://t.co/vd8u4v9vQY
These hilarious comments are so over 90% of people’s heads lol https://t.co/tFHB8CA29I
Are we really having a short history lesson tonight on #TheBachelerotte 😖 all I can hope for at this point is that Lincoln starts trying to explain why the world is flat 🤔
😂🤣 https://t.co/xG2f1dwJNK
This is so sad. Giraffes are such docile, beautiful, graceful animals. I don’t see the “sport” in this. I wish I hadn’t seen this picture but it’s important to have laws against this type of hunting. 😥 https://t.co/HDUeidrMpb
😂 omg this is so funny. https://t.co/iLa76SQ72p
It’s weird bc I had SO much fun filming in Turkey and Namibia during battle of the seasons. I didn’t even realize we were gone that long. https://t.co/2vO8qolIxC
I cried actual tears. Please don’t let Sam go home 💔 https://t.co/JikZ8svMiG
It’s not the length of filming. For me it’s living with some of these people who have zero respect. Like fist fighting near girls etc. that stuff used to get you sent home, now it’s gets you another season. Ridiculous https://t.co/yqdfUId2fU
Wait. Who is JC 🤣 https://t.co/mTikqzB3M2
Yes!!! I agree. https://t.co/x6z17zbQCJ
Hahaha. Idk about the 2 bro-dudes. They’re normally always my least fav. I already know that person a million times on tv. Boring. I like the country thing. I like the cop thing. I like Swaggy but wish he didn’t do 3rd person lol https://t.co/1F6wnEcshQ
Hahaha. Normally I feel like that (remember Jerry) but this guy seems fun. He needs to be more social. He’s super interesting in interviews https://t.co/Ay0dZlQsNK
I hope so. My two favorites are Sam and Steve the cop! https://t.co/m3O6LW2J5f
@EvelDick I know you’re going to give me hell but I was crying actual tears from tonight’s episode hahaha. I hate the robot thing. And they didn’t even put her face on noms board so people are not attached to her. She has no chance!
I adore her!!! 💔 She is so kind under such a bad circumstance. She handled it so well. https://t.co/mDeZq7xFSh
Sorry. WEST Coasters 😂 https://t.co/4BjsN5YPpA
Ok I don’t want to give spoilers yet for the East Coasters. But this is the first time I legit cried during a @CBSBigBrother episode 😕 #BigBrother https://t.co/4BjsN5YPpA
I like Bayleigh she’s cute. Tyler i was prepared to hate but he gave some good comments in interviews. Still love the undercover cop best so far. I love nerding out on this show 😂 https://t.co/n20OYBgmx5
@CBSBigBrother second episode tonight!! It’s the only show on tv my husband asks multiple times if it’s still recording 👏🏼 Who are your favorites after episode one? I like Steve &amp; geeky guy but obv that will probably change next week
Yeah I agree because I think Sam has the cutest personality. She’s really funny. I hope they get rid of chakra chick. I can’t with the auras. https://t.co/sZKwtdplCZ
@enews showed my threesome makeout in the hot tub from #realworld tonight. Damn. I miss that bikini. https://t.co/TFW4XQRJtF
We still text! I actually need to text her now that I think of it but she’s always great. She has her own business and being a lady boss. Still same funny personality. ❤️ https://t.co/isDNQ1wl3e
Both have beautiful kids! Brynn is doing amazing and Irulan’s husband and I talk via fb and she looks EXACTLY the same. Still hot. It isn’t fair hahaha. https://t.co/hGV6YKeqoh
I keep in touch with almost everyone I had a genuine friendship with. Everyone on my season except Alton (only bc he’s not on social media or a texter) but yeah Adam, Katie, Mark L from road rules and obviously love people I shared RW with! https://t.co/XbPlw7kKDf
Thanks! Yeah I loved my time there and never regretted a second of Real World. We worked with some good humans. Both cast and crew. https://t.co/80gDFJInXJ
😖 AWFUL hahaha. The hair. The outfits. My bloated face from too many vodka cranberries.... good times. https://t.co/98az4JusUH
YES!!! Although last I heard they still had up those hideous pictures of us from 2002 😂 I hope they took those down. I always get nostalgic when I visit @Palms I love it there! https://t.co/rKddwGmoI3
Wanna smile today? Just heard ⁦@BigBoi⁩ song #AllNight on the radio. LOVE it!  Let’s take a break from the mean stuff and negativity today, yeah??  https://t.co/gPB5ZvbvIk

BEST EVER #GroceryStoreJoe #TheBachelorette https://t.co/sLdzryyuih
Y’all. My husband’s face (who has a degree in Aerospace Engineering &amp; is a pilot) when the guy starts talking about the Earth being flat 🤣 We literally just heard this convo from a homeless man outside of Walmart 2 days ago #theBachelorette @BacheloretteABC
Wow. It looks like I ate another Trishelle and just stuffed her in my cheeks 🤮 https://t.co/cvglLTps81
Thank GOD for this (even if fake) drama between @whats_ur_sign_  and @ravengates  This season is so boring and awful this is the only thing that’s keeping my attention @BacheloretteABC related. Great job, girls. 👏🏼 https://t.co/Xoq8BLnVUg
That was the worst. My eyes were crying and I was sweating from the pepper heat, and I wiped my eyes while holding a pepper like a dummy. That was pretty painful lol https://t.co/3SeAXNYf58
Wait. Was I on that? 🤣 I feel like my flight there was longer than the amount of time I was in the house. https://t.co/rjoKo6EJ9R
Yes!!!! https://t.co/42OmI557ii
@Bourdain Kitchen Confidential was one of my favorite books I’ve read. See below quote from him. When people mention killing themselves, even joking, it can be a sign they are in trouble. Heartbroken but happy you’re done with the pain now #AnthonyBourdain https://t.co/wsfMp7LW8t
Y’all. This girl is my hero. 😂👏🏼 https://t.co/NNcpNi3Tk8
Has to be biscuits.  Mmmm biscuits and gravy. 🤪 https://t.co/Ako17TtBMv
@katespadeny Wow. This one really got me. Rest In Peace #KateSpade You were a fashion and decor icon that many people like myself looked up to.  Sending love to everyone that knew her. 💔
Well, he gave one of the greatest lines ever on #TheBachelerotte tonight: “I have a higher IQ than you’d think most male models would have” 😂 And to say it with a straight face made me love him even more 👏🏼 https://t.co/k3avBTnf0m
Yes! Everyone’s thoughts 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/MYLcTmRtxO
I like them on other people but for the most part I look like I have diaper booty in them 😖😂 https://t.co/y8vKKTCGFy
You are incredibly brave! I’m so sorry you had to go through that at such a young age. ❤️ https://t.co/ToFkbYHQyL
Hahahahaha. Well put! And yeah of course I still watch CNN. Just disappointed they’re giving weight to this particular claim. https://t.co/EaJMDYNmCo
I am also the type of person who had a difficult time putting someone in jail even though what was done was horrible. I can’t imagine ruining someone’s career, family and reputation because they made me feel uncomfortable.  That’s just me. https://t.co/NinChIm6zy
I was using the word purposefully for effect. You seem very emotional about this subject, so I’m sorry for whatever experience you have had. For me, I do not believe every alleged offense needs to be called out on national news. https://t.co/NinChIm6zy
Thank you boo! https://t.co/UMFKVUc51G
Thank you so much. Yes I am very happy and def have found peace which is important ❤️❤️ https://t.co/0TAkYQaDb4
Of course I do!!! Hiiiii ;) https://t.co/gj58G7UvGE
And that is exactly what I’m saying. When you are in court many of the time it’s your word against theirs. When the general public continues to hear these “offended” women on CNN everyday, it could make a jury feel less inclined to believe a victim. https://t.co/7wrezhbOwk
I’ll respectfully and completely disagree with you. Having actually been in court and faced my rapist, I find this particular accusation offensive to people who have been through a real crime. https://t.co/8HN9mnnSgW
Women like @Chloe_Melas are making it difficult for REAL cases of rape and assault to be prosecuted. False accusations are desensitizing people to these crimes and this woman should be held accountable. Shame on @HLNTV  &amp; @CNN for reporting this garbage! https://t.co/ksgmTKLP61
Bahahahaha. That tweet is so suspect though! https://t.co/yavvTexpwA
...and Dan #RoseanneCancelled #JackieandDan https://t.co/8LDJThHgaM

👏🏻🤣 The best. https://t.co/UEUMuxHut1
I don’t know? I thought she was just a Tom boy like I was when I was little. I’m sure if my mom allowed me to cut my hair I would have done the same. I hated my long hair and I always wished I was a boy.  🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/s5TQZg6jHj
I still can’t believe she’s 8. I couldn’t be trust to pour milk without spilling the entire gallon when I was her age https://t.co/RFGZHSdnZD

Forever Goals @MichelleObama https://t.co/GIaeP5iedK
Yeah but imagine your idol growing up inviting on you onstage during a show which should’ve been SO memorable and awesome for her and then he has an entire crowd yell/berate her for singing his own written lyrics. That’s so wrong lol I would’ve DIED 💀 https://t.co/HP8loKUTqd
That’s what I would’ve done, &amp; what she should’ve done, but she didn’t. She knew all the words &amp; it seems like he set her up to see what she would do, then publicly embarrass her.  She was singing lyrics he wrote &amp; he invited her up there to humiliate her https://t.co/EZTHONB3d6
No no no. If you wrote the lyrics, you invited your fan on stage, who knew every word to sing your song, you are wrong to embarrass  her for singing it! I love #KendrickLamar but this is just tacky. Just don’t ask the girl on stage in the first place. https://t.co/YSppZW6C6X
😂👏🏼 her look was my favorite of the day (beside David Beckham) https://t.co/PLD0zgoQFp

#ParklandSchoolShooting don’t be ignorant https://t.co/WhdvL3spV0
You are wrong. Airports are as safe as they can be. And also pilots. The reason I know this is bc my husband IS a pilot. What do you do? https://t.co/MYPMZqaPX7
It was!!! lol https://t.co/3Smbp1bf9N
I grew up on the bayou with responsible parents. Also we were never huge gun people. It wasn’t my upbringing. Daddy had one pistol for protection on road trips and camping and I never saw it. https://t.co/g2YhOCRwn7
Yes! $325 for an amazing 1 bedroom with a pool! Lol https://t.co/Bn2ooNjo9s
Re: I’m not sure about TSA. Metal detectors would be sufficient in schools bc schools don’t typically fly and have the intricacies of being in the air and a pilot and you know, like hypoxia and stuff. But what do I know. I’m probably stupid https://t.co/WmAYoyjKQt
Coming from Europe recently, our travel security is way more strict. Other countries are fine financially also have less crime, so not sure about the TSA thing. These are kids in US though. Schools are targets. It’s time to spend more on protecting them https://t.co/NCtVDF1xqK
YES!!! I support all vets! My hubby is military and I think that’s a great idea. ❤️ https://t.co/ahvjSbSV6V
I used to be one of those “it’s too soon” to talk about gun control after a shooting. I have completely changed my mind. 22 school shootings in less than 6 months? I don’t event have kids and this is unacceptable to me. It’s enough! https://t.co/nz0eJxHcEY
Seems like a court house, right? But why would we protect people in court more than children? I think that’s a good start! https://t.co/hU7JcsQUqk
If you allow a minor access to guns then you should be prosecuted if they kill 10 innocent people for parental neglect. Idk I’m not a lawyer. But it seems criminal to me. https://t.co/Bd47C2VuNw
Last tweet didn’t make sense lol. There should be metal detectors in every school, teachers need to be paid WAY more, security at schools is necessary at this point and state reps will find a way to cut spending somewhere. Maybe their salary. https://t.co/biyTFh4OGg
Jesus. 100%  so many streets that need to be fixed. Yes. Gun laws need to be more strict, but also parents need to be held legally accountable for their kids’ actions when guns are in the house and a crime is committed. https://t.co/PpcE741DBe
Eeeesh.  I can imagine that. People don’t want to ruffle feathers or think it’s over exaggerating but I think it’s time to take everything seriously. https://t.co/3HUroTah0I
Thankfully! You help mold them which is awesome. Teachers are underpaid and under appreciated and now schools are targets. It’s so sad. You guys have the most important job. ❤️ https://t.co/1QrhkrSLhe
Good question. Maybe refer to guidance counselor. Don’t they have authority to report suspicious behavior to police? If so, possibly something would be found out? It crosses a privacy line I’m sure but how much privacy do you think a high schooler deserves? https://t.co/4xZ1gu17A6
I’m just curious bc I don’t personally know any teachers. Are teachers able to report suspicious behavior or any student they feel fits a profile of someone who would be a shooter? Is it encouraged? #SantaFeHighSchool
Stop saying it’s not a warning sign when a teenager wears a trench coat  to school everyday even in 90 degree weather! That’s NOT normal. Several kids mentioned it in interviews so clearly they thought it was strange. @CNN #SantaFeHighSchool
Oh when she was hugging her little sister I lost it https://t.co/jil2gZPD25
And I cry every time they send someone home. I cannot watch a child cry. Nope. 😭😬 https://t.co/ZFsdPUWpj6
Also I think Avery on @MasterChefJrFOX needs her own cooking show. It’s bananas that she is that good at 8 years old. She is seriously talented.
Wow. These kids on @MasterChefJrFOX  are SO impressive. Not just as cooks...also  camera presence and personality. It’s crazy that 8-10 year olds who aren’t professionally trained can take direction so well! 👏🏻 #MasterChefJunior
No but I must have a twin bc someone else said they thought they saw me in a commercial recently. 🤣 https://t.co/BtkETXWDgs
Right?! And none of them would’ve had to endure the worst character on tv, ever....British Emily https://t.co/MYxGJXWqMw
If you don’t cry when the kids get sent home on @MasterChefJrFOX  you have no soul 🤣 Sad to see Mikey go! That child is absolutely precious.

Just watched and I don’t understand why people are mad about your conversation with Justin. That is exactly how I am with ALL of my guy friends. They need my advice! There’s a reason why they’re all single! 😂 https://t.co/jhWU7diBoU
😂🤣👏🏼 https://t.co/uYrpo1lmZf
WHAT?! You’re having her on your show? I’m excited to listen! 👏🏻 https://t.co/bTLAmR7Wsp
Love this! https://t.co/pJHVvblaUS
DEAD 💀 https://t.co/wiwaySEYjz
Hey! Hope your team does well. But ‘dem Saints ‘do !!! We are going to kill it this season. https://t.co/kR7fA2tCS0
Are y’all pumped for football? @Saints https://t.co/8tkZAkf4l5
No need to be sorry! That’s your opinion. I got a different vibe watching him. He seemed humbled especially from all the hate he has received from both parties. But everyone deserves a level of respect when they agree to be interviewed by someone. https://t.co/CU4ed1olkv
I’m not inviting him to dinner or anything lol I just thought he handled himself well while being grilled on live tv. https://t.co/QN2ZFCM2uD
He may have done something illegal, but when they told him live on air he was officially being investigated, he handled it very well. He didn’t get defensive and was very humble. Doing something illegal doesn’t always mean you’re a bad person. https://t.co/CU4ed1olkv
Bahahaha! I’m DEAD. *side note I think @Comey handled himself lovely on @TheView today. Family man &amp; class act, despite #meghanmccain ‘s rude, childish, unfactual &amp; laughable comments. J. Edgar Hoover...what a twit. I would say #dontquityourdayjob ...BUT 🙏🏼 https://t.co/v8zCKOPHD1
If you watched @TheView today Meghan said she questions Stormys motives but she didn’t question Leanne’s motives because they are “best friends” seems a little unfair and biased. They both did a media tour, both bc of inappropriate behavior of political men https://t.co/7IzSp3s6q2
They’re both bad lol but why question Stormy Daniels motives and not any other person coming out with accusations? Sleeping with the president while he is married is a public interest story. Her being a porn star/liberal should have nothing to do with it https://t.co/7IzSp3s6q2
Lol you people are nuts. I never would support unwanted groping of anyone. But you simply cannot support one person coming out with those claims and chastise another simply because of political affiliation. That’s the point. https://t.co/FQhG9FCGW6
Where in that tweet did I defend Al Franken? Like Meghan McCain, it seems you have an issue with getting your facts straight. https://t.co/3w9Z7gjwiI
Meghan is self admittedly “best friends” with Leanne Tweeden who went on a huge media tour (also went on @TheView) accusing Al Franken of groping her but Stormy doing the same thing is not okay? Meghan is a hypocrite and breaks all journalistic ethics https://t.co/riuEg4mbML
Congrats!!! https://t.co/Eitv8OI8Rj
Did anyone else cry like a baby when @CaroleRadziwill finished the NYC marathon?! #RHONY
ONE. I got one damn extra life. I have no friends 😂 https://t.co/6mjbEwIvc8
Physician’s Assistant. But at this point I’ve been in school long enough to be a doctor 😂🤣 https://t.co/VL0f8PCYHV
No I’ve been crazy busy with school. 7 classes all Chemistry and Biology courses=no time to sit at a table for 10 hours 😞 https://t.co/vPXF0TO7Np
@TheView @MeghanMcCain I’m not sure how long her contract is, but for the love of my ears please find another co-host. She is awful. These childish temper tantrums are an embarrassment to your show.  I’ll throw out 90% of your audience can’t stand and can’t relate to Meghan
Did anyone seeing this win @hqtrivia just now?! I’m obsessed with knowing someone who won lol. Also nooo I’m not getting paid to promote them lol. I just love the game. Oh and @TheRock did AMAZING. He was hilarious!

@JedediahBila was great. I loved her. Super relatable. I feel like if I met her we would be friends. https://t.co/7SSSpxKCpK
I’m starting to believe @TheView keeps McCain on to make Republicans look bad. There’s no way they think the audience responds well to her. She is unlikeable, unrelatable and unpleasant. If I wanted to see an uptight, pissy, whiner I would watch Fox News https://t.co/tmONuGaT8d
❤️ https://t.co/WKakRZ9AQV
Someone’s having a worse week than myself https://t.co/BC6ZmdyHl7
You were always hot with a nice lil booty https://t.co/FH0Lw8YNFM
Well. I was waiting for someone else to say it. Thanks @ThatCoral 😂😂 https://t.co/JGyKtzgAmB
WHAT?! 30 and 40 year olds aren’t hot anymore?!  😂🤣 I’ll agree on the hook up thing but I still like to party https://t.co/FBWIBEWcFz
Cowards say nothing at all. I’m the antithesis of a coward https://t.co/5mRLJ23uuW
I didn’t @ her because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings or start trouble, while still expressing my opinion. I assumed she would be too busy to search for her hashtags on Twitter. Guess not. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/t8nSdNxRD0
Truth. I was in my senior year of college and 22. It’s not like we had jobs or anything important going on at the time. It was basically a free vacation with strangers that happened to be filmed, edited and broadcast https://t.co/5JqWIa73VL
🤣😂 hilarious. https://t.co/1CVqjjwvfd
I’ll take that! https://t.co/VvwaPgWtFq
Sure am! Among other things. You’re a fan of Playboy? https://t.co/gY7yVMtcLL
Bahahaha. I just tweeted about her today. You’re so right “my father” this or that. She also name drops like crazy and eye rolls at her Co hosts or anyone who has a different opinion. https://t.co/IYG9m81HrV
I miss her so much! She was great. https://t.co/Yc38oTNPAo
#MeghanMcCain is the worst mixture of super republican, super millennial, and super bratty. I love watching @TheView every morning but her RBF and piss poor attitude makes it hard to watch. And she’s rude to the other hosts! Is there really no other option?
When Chris Harrison said “Lauren I can’t imagine what’s going on in your head right now” ...did she just say “yeah me neither” 😂🤣 if that doesn’t say it all.
Shocker! Lauren taking Arie back right away with no questions and Becca ALL of a sudden has “closure” and is “ready to move on”. Nice campaign for #Bachelorette. This show is unbelievable. 🤮 #BachelorFinale
I think she has a lot of regrets about that. https://t.co/hKLZtKR9Mc
I Agee with you. I initially wanted @ShannonElizab to win then when she was done I wanted @OMAROSA out of the two @helloross was my husbands fav from day 1. https://t.co/R4GDea9J4N
#CELEBRITYBB I have to say anyone hating on @OMAROSA is WRONG. I know her as a person and have done several shows with her and she is an amazing woman. Been through more than y’all even know. Good, Christian soul, and extremely intelligent. So. That. ❤️
Are you kidding?! I would die! 100% I would. It’s my fav reality show https://t.co/xAveEjzbWz
Ok am I the only one who wants to see @BrandiGlanville and @jamesmaslow on @AmazingRaceCBS ?! They would be epic #CELEBRITYBB #CelebrityBigBrother
...and my husband has already sent me a #BachelorWinterGames Yuki cry on audio message from upstairs 🤦🏼‍♀️
Hahahaha. He’s not Elvis. I’m not gonna lie. He is extremely good looking. https://t.co/0fWikpgKUy
Hahahahahaha. I know! Poor thing 😂 I love that you watch! https://t.co/Gej7n3hkPv
Catching up on @BachWinterGames isn’t it funny how on all the bachelor shows Clare has been on she’s always rejected as the old chick (she’s only 36 btw) and now all the foreigners are falling for her? Sort of love that. #BachelorWinterGames
Bahahaha and this quote came from a journalist. Good eye. Good eye. 🤣 https://t.co/dotYdpXf3F
As a Christian woman....YES! YES! Guns ARE the problem. Why does anyone need an AR-15?!  Side note. If you are a Christian, in the Bible it says we will always be mocked. But we stand for God. Why do you care to be mocked? I don’t! https://t.co/o0DMSS6jME
I cannot believe how insensitive you are.  Beside being so off base, you sound so cold and mean. You are a public figure. You can THINK of a better way to prevent this from happening again. Some people (not myself) do look up to you. Be better. https://t.co/ewUkif0Gp4
Yes! I love @CaryDeuber as well! Her husband is hot and I wished mine wanted to dress that well 🙌🏼 https://t.co/p9Mcsvf9tC
If @BrandiRedmond and @stephhollman ever left the show there would be no reason to watch 🤷🏼‍♀️ #RHOD https://t.co/ptyl4bPlFQ

Just wrote you! https://t.co/m0KUtnOc47
😂🤣 https://t.co/wYKa9Y3zdO
Everyone is in sweaters while Kardashley is literally wearing lingerie and she still can’t get someone to take her virginity 😂 #BachelorWinterGames #bachelorwintergames ashley
I can’t handle all the time @ABCNetwork wastes with these crappy unknown musicians on #BachelorWinterGames it’s so annoying.
Is it too early to talk about #CELEBRITYBB tonight? I don’t want to spoil
You guys. This is a really difficult night for me. #CelebrityBigBrother and #TheBachelor on at the same time as snowboarding #OlympicGames2018 😖 that’s ALOT of tv for one night
Ross is for sure getting all the scoop for us back home. I love how he’s low key interviewing people during the show 😂 https://t.co/qxunGVUc8o
It’s so early. I love Omarosa bc she is always fabulous on tv. I love @ShannonElizab so much and I think she could win but I hope she plays her smarts down more. Metta is hilarious and so is Ross. It’s hard! They’re all good! #CELEBRITYBB https://t.co/BFq1ykTIuP
#RegrettaWorldPeace easily the funniest thing on #CELEBRITYBB so far tonight
😍👏🏼 https://t.co/fHsB9i20j6
Ok. I think #rhbh is officially done when an entire episode is dedicated to one person leaving a restaurant. This is so dumb. Bring Brandi or another crazy back
Stfu lol. I love you. https://t.co/vwQb6fhNvs
Oh! Haha yes I will sadly say the Real World was real. Honestly I wish I could say it was fake bc that would excuse my behavior but that’s not true. @BunimMurray actually keeps everything real and what you see is reality 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/iEeEnlfdp8
By the way. I answer every question honestly and I don’t care what people say. So go ahead. https://t.co/UJVIhsn67V
Yes obv #TeamShannon of course I want her to win! I want her to downplay now though. She is the best player there https://t.co/9oIbLzGpko
I’m not sure what you are referring to? Abortion? https://t.co/UJVIhsn67V
Honestly the best teacher I know for poker is @JeffMadsenobv https://t.co/dm8HbePcKT
I’ll follow up with this. If Bernie was up, I would have felt okay voting for him. My personal beliefs wouldn’t allow me to vote for Trump and my husbands military background didn’t allow me to with conscious vote for Hillary. https://t.co/P0WJlf4gAv
I did not vote this year. I chose not to. I didn’t like either candidate. I think both sides could have done a hell of a lot better. Our choices were awful in my opinion and I didn’t feel good going either way. https://t.co/P0WJleMFbV
I’m not watching the #CELEBRITYBB feeds but again from what I know personally of Omarosa, she never acted or spoke poorly to me or anyone based on race. She’s mean with an agenda. Not based on race lol. She’s good tv. https://t.co/ClYAtXNS52
Yes. It could be a show I hate and if Omarosa is on it, I’ll watch lol. She’s so so good. https://t.co/drAM0AD8Mx
😂🤣 Shannon is smart though! She is a crazy good poker player. I think she’s everyone’s target though so I hope she calms down a bit. Honestly so far I’m obsessed with everyone. No one I hate (well maybe Disney guy) 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/TQ4cfdrGYO
I love Omarosa too!! She’s easily the best reality tv personality ever. And people forget that she has been through a lot of heartbreak. AND she’s crazy smart. I’m a fan of hers. https://t.co/ftu6QKCZhM
Shannon is SO good. But 16 letters?! GIRL!!! Calm down! 😂 https://t.co/gQRyhWazaj
Agree on both. I know Omarosa always comes off so bad on tv but from personal experience with her she is really not an awful person I swear lol https://t.co/rx3lX4nTfS
I don’t want to give spoilers bc like a super cool person I stayed home on a Friday to watch #CELEBRITYBB  but let me know your favorites or thoughts if you watched! I’m curious.
How. HOW is it possible I love @BBCelebrityUS more than regular?! I.  Can’t. Get. Enough. #CELEBRITYBB @EvelDick let me know when you’re ready for me
Um have you ever watched a 90’s rom-com? This has been done forever. The fact that a comedian is confused by entertainment is confusing in itself. https://t.co/aA4Qlb3BKk
Yes! Nice job @YouTube 👏🏼 Finally these ridiculous, socially irresponsible social media “stars” are being held accountable for their actions. https://t.co/3fqVDWelAv
Every time my kids say they’re bored or want to get on YouTube I’m going to tell them to go outside and play with a stick or spin around until they’re dizzy. Think that will work? 🤣 https://t.co/44SZzb5zp1
Torturing/playing with a dead anything is not acceptable. This is the same guy who put a video up of a deceased man who committed suicide in Japan. This kid has a lack of remorse/emotion that resembles a sociopath 😳 https://t.co/JBDpgFTuvO
What is this guy going to have to do to get his @YouTube channel shut down? Kill someone? 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/kefUd5hwud
Catching up on episode 1 of @BBCelebrityUS and got to see the  lovely @JeanieBuss make an appearance! Aghhh this show is SO good so far! #CELEBRITYBB go @ShannonElizab ❤️❤️
New respect for this young lady!👏🏻❤️ https://t.co/loacwyf5YA

Yes indeed! Haha https://t.co/IVScDwue0Q
YES!!! I am beyond excited about this season. @JeanieBuss is always great on your show. https://t.co/5dQwZWS3VY
And Tammy! “IT WASNT NOT FUNNY” is almost as good as “come on be my baby tonight” 😂🤣 https://t.co/7wJSywSTt1
It aired on MTV 2 awhile back. The original NY one too! I am not sure where else you could watch though. I would love to see the old San Fran one. https://t.co/cLD1IWgWYP
I hope you’re joking 🤣 ...not him, but we are still friends. He didn’t like me. I cried the entire time like a fool. https://t.co/IBnPoxMAmg
You’re sweet ;) he was just being funny https://t.co/wL5y7tPHTQ
Lol. I tried to watch recently and it was so boring my husband fell asleep. Reality tv has become so crazy that it makes our season look tame. https://t.co/glNcUefj8m
Kidding https://t.co/AroNZGgRFL
But I do hate women. https://t.co/AroNZGgRFL
I believe you, but sometimes people will take that as truth and that can be hurtful. Just saying. https://t.co/AroNZGgRFL
I didn’t write my Wiki. I believe the assumption was since I am from a tiny town in the south, that I would be racist, which if you watched the show, you would know that I am not. You really shouldn’t throw accusations like that until you know that to be true https://t.co/XLQXsgk1Az
No I just think it’s weak to call someone you don’t know racist when they defended themselves after you insulted them for no reason. But hey, what do I know. I was on MTV 15  years ago. I have no brain cells. https://t.co/yo8dVd4Qig
That’s a great go-to! You can serve it up but you can’t take it, can you? https://t.co/QJSTB06ELa
Yeah. At first glance, you look like a genius. Thanks for the compliment earlier. https://t.co/YkNVHCJEWj
That’s not what you said. https://t.co/Rv7QLuOMMT
Sp Trishelle. You’ve been tweeting me for hours, you should know the spelling by now. https://t.co/rxWrr8pwtX
Isn’t this also a “weird anectodal” assumption? https://t.co/RgEkT76KdE
Hahahaha you really are killing me. I love your type. https://t.co/LyT2zXcUSr
I told you I would ask my husband if that were true. I think he would know better than yourself, no offense. Also, what’s keeping them from joining now? Women can do whatever they want to do today. https://t.co/Z49uCouZuV
No I actually agree that typically men create less office issues than women do. I don’t think saying it to an employee is appropriate. I think even my friend would agree with that. https://t.co/58JhtMwW51
My PA friend was literally told by her (doctor) boss a few weeks ago he couldn’t wait to hire a male PA because “they listen more” 😳 https://t.co/y4FHbjUyAL
It’s easier to get into PA school if you are a male because they are looking for diversity. I know this because I am currently in that situation. https://t.co/UsbgprhgYQ
I’ll have to ask my husband about that since he is a fighter pilot. I do know that women are encouraged now. https://t.co/CH6YxcsuWP
Can’t stop won’t stop. You LOVE it. https://t.co/cEBSy8ZfxN
Ok. Since there are more women in the world, why aren’t there more garbage women or female fighter pilots? Just because you exist, doesn’t make you an expert in something. How is that hard to comprehend? https://t.co/BTXlAorsWY
Exactly. Adele and Beyoncé has their sweeping years too! https://t.co/tCq9bEb8mT
How does that prove females were better artists those years and were purposely denied the award based on gender? I don’t think you are grasping what I am saying. https://t.co/Eb37XllpT5
If you showed me a solid fact that proves awards shows purposely deny women who are deserving of an award to favor men then I will reconsider my opinion. https://t.co/wPgZ0wlvIm
Everyone sure thinks they deserve one and when they don’t win there HAS to be a reason (race, gender, etc) ..sometimes people are just better than you. That’s life. https://t.co/4ACOAmEk8N
I have an open mind. I just don’t agree with you and that’s okay. Ratings also don’t lie. I don’t think the only reason the ratings dropped so much is because your mom didn’t know some of the artists https://t.co/jl47exyDua
Since you love powerful women so much, you’ll appreciate this: you won’t win this debate with me. But here’s your participation trophy 🏆 https://t.co/rJqsjYNDib
No darling, I used to watch awards shows, but I stopped when people cared more about making a statement that had nothing to do with why they were there in the first place. Do you understand now? https://t.co/rJqsjYNDib
The first thing I saw on Twitter this morning were hashtags about the Grammys being anti female and how Kesha should’ve won because she was raped and Ed Sheehan was not. (Personally I do think Praying is a better song but not for that reason) https://t.co/A8PuhLzBtU
It’s a little hard to miss headlines about awards shows when you are reading news about the world https://t.co/wy7bQCaITt
I just told you I don’t watch awards shows. Pay attention! 🤗 https://t.co/JC6GFikPHt
Thank you for taking the time to google how movie campaigns work and to show me someone else’s opinion and research on it. https://t.co/syeb8NalPq
Honestly I don’t know enough about politics to speak much about it to people I don’t know very well. I did not vote this year even though I paid close attention to the election. I didn’t like either of them more than the other. https://t.co/unjNzgb6Wf
Lol. Yes you are right. I don’t understand how awards are not based on merit. https://t.co/M7E14N267T
Yeah I think when you win an award it is nice to thank your agent, family, fans etc and tell people about your music or how you got to where you are. I like to hear success stories from talented people. https://t.co/vywAZHCdYk
I’m saying it’s possible there were better male performers this year than female performers as a whole. Why do we have to give away awards to make it even for everyone? We already have male and female categories. https://t.co/TpIzrmVyoG
Still waiting on that Taylor Swift (and also Adele) thing. https://t.co/UQ36XkWcae
You don’t know my political beliefs so you wouldn’t know if I agree or disagree. You’re making an ASSumption. I’m telling you that I don’t enjoy 5 minute award  speeches about anyone’s political/movement belief if I agree or not. https://t.co/rXtFfl5ve9
Why are you not addressing what I said twice about Taylor Swift? Lol she beat put everyone and cleaned up a few years ago. So tell me why women are not equal in the music industry? https://t.co/5WP0uld0gr
We can agree to disagree on this one. I know I didn’t watch/record bc I am personally sick of seeing entertainers on awards shows spew their political beliefs and hashtags on the viewers. I think many people would agree with me. https://t.co/qLFSXsjv1o
But are there more talented women in music this year than men? It doesn’t have to do with numbers. I thought Grammy awards were based on talent. Again. Didn’t Taylor Swift clean house a few years ago?? https://t.co/lh8DHMPgtq
I think the ratings speak for itself. How did I use an exception to the rule? What “rule” do you speak of? And why should the majority be female? The majority of winners and moms should be the best artist, not based on gender https://t.co/atTvgyFitr
I wish! She blocked me. Hahahahahaha. Someone couldn’t take the heat 🔥 https://t.co/x915Sj8Y42
Since when did women not have an equal opportunity in music? Didn’t Taylor Swift dominate the Grammys a few years back? This is why the Grammys ratings tanked this year. The majority of people are saying they don’t want to see politics in entertainment https://t.co/HIDvXZyPxc
Well that’s what happens when actors use an awards show as a political platform. https://t.co/PMeusBHDJS
I guess she didn’t want to play...moving on.
Not your sis. Don’t insult me. Ironic you call me ignorant though. You should re read that Bible verse you proudly display on your account. https://t.co/3lKAG7Y1BB

I’m so happy you watch Bachelor lol https://t.co/CCw42qU3UN
@hqtrivia ummm. On question 5 It did not show my question at all. Then told me I was eliminated. What gives?
@TheOnion wins the internet today. https://t.co/GXtObSrHNN
Preach!! She’s so rude it makes me uncomfortable to watch. https://t.co/C9Ob0DJDqn
@TheView please bring @JedediahBila back to replace @MeghanMcCain  I am tired of seeing her throw hissy fits, name drop, bring every convo back to herself, and be rude to guests and her co-hosts. She is painful to watch
I’m not cool enough! I will be watching though and tweeting about it. You know I love some Big Brother https://t.co/ImTkKlVsPn
I do. It’s just shocking that comedians are paid that much. I guess I never thought about it. 11 million is crazy money for one gig. https://t.co/kOtBmpN3fJ
Agreed! That is a crap load of money! I do also think it’s ridiculous that anyone would pay a comedian 11 million dollars to be funny for an hour lol https://t.co/gioxn7woRo
I give you 4.7 million reasons why @amyschumer would be paid more than Monique. No one is going to boycott Netflix for making a good business decision. Does Monique even have Twitter? https://t.co/i1TbPNkJz5

Ah! A “feminist” who bashes another woman by unfounded name calling in order to get their point across? Say it isn’t so!!!! Darling, compose yourself and try again please. 👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/7ZTa6kkGrP
So now “non verbal cues” are a thing? #MeToo have forced men to become mind readers now. And if you are vocal of the movement as a man, any woman you had a bad date with will come out to ruin you. What a time to be a male.
This makes me so proud to be a @Saints fan. We love you, boys! Thank you for an exciting season. Can’t wait for next year. #blackandgold #BlessYouBoys https://t.co/xKJYkIqn5L

This little girl is brilliant. Love the tenacity 😂👏🏻.  https://t.co/txAUPciWEb
It’s so true. I don’t have kids but if I do I will make sure they are kind souls and if they aren’t. I am NOT afraid to whoop their ass like my mamma did to me haha. The worst part was the apology to her parents. I think all kids need that https://t.co/qBChbC6KEx
I was a bully once to a girl when I was 13. I remember bc my mom found out and whooped my ass, punished me for a month, and made me apologize to her and her parents. Kids aren’t perfect but parents can try. All you can do now is apologize https://t.co/53clFVTAGr
Keaton you are right, It will get better for you!  You have been given such a strong voice and inspired so many people recently! I pray and know you will find your forever friends who love you very soon. ❤️ #KeatonJones #StandWithKeaton #ItGetsBetter https://t.co/LnRNRIFFOf
“Asking for a friend”? 😂 https://t.co/QIze3nNx53
Hahahaha. That is great https://t.co/txXavkCxDG
@devontafreeman pulled the old tweet and delete after insulting @Saints and accusing Payton of choke signal. #lame ..See you in 2 weeks, you overpaid prick.
I’m so jealous y’all got all the snow! We just had slush in the city 😖 https://t.co/XTszwA1i2F
“You are hurting. My eardrums” Hahahaha https://t.co/zwgr5TittZ
Those guys are the most hilarious I’ve ever seen. All of the videos. 🤣 https://t.co/zwgr5TittZ
I saw Key from @KeyAndPeele on @TheView today and I watched a million of their videos over again 😂 so funny. Here’s my favorite:  https://t.co/MPwsNIZz5s
I used to love her, but I’ll have to agree with you. It was so awkward how she spoke to Joy today.  I think childish is a good way to describe her behavior.  The pissy face and eye rolling is too much. https://t.co/YDtQxe67ri
What makes me happy today is that everyone except Alabama fans are rooting against Alabama
You can take me off this list now because I would never do another challenge. Especially under the producer I worked with on my last show https://t.co/jpocSz85id
Murder On The Orient Express.  Yes or no?
I wasn’t talking about me! I have been in WAY worse situations than these women. But I took action immediately. I didn’t wait. I also didn’t want fame, money, political gain etc. I question many of these women https://t.co/eZB5ipcqMV
Mmmm. So many thoughts on these alleged sexual assaults/harassment allegations... deciding if I should keep It light tonight or go ahead and play with the trolls 🤔
I have. I tried to spread them out but I was hooked! https://t.co/IOZPM1h5SY
If you’re not watching @MINDHUNTER_  on @netflix , you should be. https://t.co/Zq3M6ujXSa

Me when @ChickfilA is closed on Sundays 😂 https://t.co/CoqJpENSL3
No I think some people are afraid. I have no problem telling someone if they do something harassing to me. But I’m a loud mouth 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/wEN0YecaNB
Yes but It leaves a solid paper trail so when you pop up 10-20 years later, after hundreds of people in weeks before you claimed harassment, people can’t question your story. That is why you document things. For proof https://t.co/A1zdAinCpe
Serious question regarding these  sexual harassment accusations: Where is Human Resources or an Ethics Committee in all of this? With your job contract you should have a copy of who to report these things to.    If not, this needs to happen.
Yesssss dream team https://t.co/lorXrwPAtD
Since Christmas is around the corner, treat yourself to a @FabFitFun box! They are AWESOME and also a great gift. I never promote things on here, but this one is great.  Use my code: https://t.co/5i5k1LVYme
Hahahahaha. This is amazzzzzing.  I want to be this excited about anything just once 😂 https://t.co/MaAkZVTQzJ
Agree! That article made me sad that people feel this way. I wish people would encourage their children to love everyone, not to separate themselves based on color 😞 https://t.co/zcFv87Bs6X
I hope you change your mind on this for your kids sake, Mr Ekow. Your kids could be missing out on a future college roommate, best friend, or soul mate. Don’t limit their friendships based on race. There are many great ppl of all colors in the world. ❤️ https://t.co/epextbbzEG
😂👏🏻 https://t.co/zs5MkJY7b6
Something great came out of watching #RHODreunion though. @LeeAnneLocken crying about her rose being her thorn. 😂 dead. Like her or not, she’s not going anywhere. #lifelessonsfromleeanne #everyrosehasitsthorn #RHOD
Just watched the #RHODreunion and as a 10 plus year reality tv veteran, I cannot for the life of me figure out who thought @KamWestcott would be great tv. If I have to hear pink dog food one more time...🤢 #RHOD #bravotv #WWHL

Thank you to all of our brave service men, kick ass ladies, &amp; those who don’t identify w/ gender who serve and have served our country!  ❤️
Thanks for all the birthday wishes y’all! Spent it in LA with my friends celebrating @JimmyDiesel wedding! Was a beautiful weekend ❤️
Luckyyyyyy https://t.co/BFvNKQvH98
You are adorable! Always classy and sweet and I cried when you cried about your son. I'm glad some storylines have substance 😜 https://t.co/sVFAMUjCXX
#RHOD here you have @stephhollman talking about personal family struggles in a touching way...Then you have pink dog food lady...🤔
Thank you @cj_wentz for clutching my @ESPNFantasy win tonight. Everyone else was worthless. 😂👏🏻🏆 #itwasclose #ESPN #FantasyFootball

I pretty special, Dirty D and you know it. 💁🏼 you're seriously making my day https://t.co/ds7ajsIIzw
Dirty D! You love it. You are still following me so you can comment and complain BC you love the drama lol. So transparent https://t.co/fzOvXdWouV
Ignorant BC I disagree with you. Typical response. https://t.co/Xoe73zZZ2F
It's 👏🏻 my 👏🏻 twitter. Just like the cross, you can choose to ignore. Now go be offended. Mmkay? https://t.co/VpA3Ppy9Ug
Well thankfully my life purpose is not to please you. https://t.co/LVe62QlvWF
Look if you don't want a debate then don't respond. Clearly I didn't write that tweet just for you. Stop being so sensitive https://t.co/E6TGM8HbAo
She's just being the typical. Wanting to find something to complain about BC life is just too damn good in 'Murica 😂 https://t.co/Rb5mWdKzyu
Omfggggg Hahahaha. Well then so can a cross! Really? The word God means nothing to an atheist. https://t.co/Wjbk3ZwJWG
Point is. People like yourself pick and choose when to be offended. In God WE trust meaning you. If you don't trust God don't spend money https://t.co/305roYgtez
Answer my question about the money thing. Pretty convenient that you still use it when it says in God WE trust??? https://t.co/305roYgtez
So you think money should be recalled because it says "in God we trust"? You spend it don't you? Honey, you're reaching. https://t.co/BrV4x99UIe
Ahhh. I love it when people who disagree with you resort to name calling. Well done. 👏🏻 pack your bags and leave please. https://t.co/wWcoMroNJM
Protected from religion as if having a cross up physically hurts someone. I thought you were a tough chick. Come on, don't be silly https://t.co/7drWiu4Dv2

This story actually hurts my heart. https://t.co/XOFkN0Dr27
You were SO right about this show. I'm addicted. It's so amazing and cringe worthy. I'm LOVING it https://t.co/RjEHB8ptt3
You're such a sweet heart ❤️ and I agree. I'll always be LSU and Saints fans no matter what https://t.co/NNmdVfK5s3

It is incredibly confusing to go from an episode of This Is Us to American Horror Story back to back. 😳 #AmericanHorrorStoryCult #imscared
I celebrated @hughhefner birthday with him and a lot of beautiful women in 2003. We will always celebrate you, Hef ❤️ #RIPHughHef
Haven't watched the docu yet but I looked it up. So powerful. Damn. Can't wait to see it and I'll let you know when I do! 😊 https://t.co/rEAyh6pdR3
I haven't dismissed this. I'm just studying for a test. I will watch. Thank you for letting me know.  I did not forget. https://t.co/rEAyh6pdR3

Just saw this today. This is HUGE. I'm currently learning about the vagus nerve in class. I freaking love science. https://t.co/zTJmciWUH2
Goodnight Twitter friends. It was awesome listening to everyone's opinions and experiences even if some disagreed. That's the beauty! 😊❤️
Dallas knelt before anthem in protest of inequality, then both teams stood, locked arms in unity during anthem. AZ with local military. https://t.co/Cpif7LvNQP
People LOVE to jump on a bandwagon. They also LOVE freedom of speech. But not if someone disagrees with them. No, no. That's just wrong lol https://t.co/s6mhlHJPBB
Love what Dallas and Arizona did tonight for the anthem! There are other ways to protest than kneeling or sitting. Beautiful and classy 👏🏻
Pat! Haven't heard from you in forever.  Good to see you haven't lost your sense of humor 😜👏🏻 #worldFamousPatLyons https://t.co/p2EqRTZuOD
I would hope these guys stand as a team to show everyone that no matter what state the country is in that we can still be unified. https://t.co/tEOuFlK9aG
Simple comparison. Pregnant lady on subway with no seats. Is one required to give up theirs? No. Should they out of respect? Yes. https://t.co/tEOuFlK9aG
I 100% agree with the protest, but I don't like the timing ppl are choosing to do it. I do think it's offensive to many people. My opinion. https://t.co/EgyiScYSRS
Look, I don't think ppl should be arrested for burning a flag or kicked off a team for kneeling. Personally, I find it disrespectful &amp; tacky https://t.co/EgyiScYSRS
Did I say that? Stop reaching. It's no secret that he has contributed to a lot of the country's divisiveness, which already existed. https://t.co/c4UEr6cbAt
Someone who lives here full time and calls this place home? I see what you're doing. Don't be weird. https://t.co/eS4qPoOqhz
YES!!!! I love Tiffany from Flavor of Love! And Dog. https://t.co/39f1TClpKZ
You haven't made a point. You gave an opinion that our flag is "just a logo". You're from the U.K. Obv our flag doesn't mean anything to you https://t.co/28Xa6ZaUKM
Watch the video below from an ex military/current NFL player. I have the same opinion that he does. Love you, but you're not an American https://t.co/5icSGgrNj8
To end this conversation from last night about sitting during the anthem &amp; BC I'm not as eloquent as Drew Brees, watch below for my thoughts https://t.co/WMFSGLlUNR
It's a fact that we are not all treated equally and I really believe that will start to change in November in about 3 years 😜 https://t.co/6DqasqzN44
You're awesome. Yes for the most part ppl were respectful! https://t.co/PRrc7ip4Z5
I respect the message, not the delivery. There are many ways to protest without disrespecting service members. https://t.co/107nEyvSwf
No! Where do you find that? No matter who they get it's going to be epic. https://t.co/HVYjqO2aXs
Haha. That would be awesome but I'm "reality" infamous. Not celeb famous 😂🤣 #letsbehonest You're sweet though! https://t.co/w57Z00u0Ou
Bigger concern: why is Richard Roeper trolling my twitter at 12:30 am? 😳
Aghh. I know what they are protesting. I get it. Nail me to the cross, but I still think it's tacky/disrespectful to sit during the anthem https://t.co/UVxYSC8PeG
You seriously didn't get the sarcasm there? Wow. https://t.co/BMUlBb5tOB
Not all publicity is good. Look at Trump hahaha https://t.co/Jjkt7lwVfe
Of course I do. I agree with what people are protesting but I disagree with the time they are choosing to do it. Is there no other way? https://t.co/KfLXw5AMcF
Oh hell no! You can't kick people out for that. That's their choice, just wish they didn't do it during anthem. https://t.co/FxC40ZCrpC
Curious as well. Dez Bryant has been getting heat for standing. But after Trump said all that rude stuff I'm thinking people will kneel https://t.co/0dtMJHPahg
True. I love my Saints! I'm just disappointed to see that today. I'll always still support my team though, no matter who kneels/stands https://t.co/sQHxiuWuEU
Happy about @Saints win but disappointed in the players sitting during the anthem. Protesting by showing disrespect defeats the purpose.
Oh yeah! That explains EVERYTHING. 😂 I was too sick to be tested for Mensa as well. 🙄 https://t.co/4IUc3zBr8m
Has anyone found out if Raven/Matt saw everything #RaveneExposedParty &amp; if she responded to her lies? @EvelDick ?
I think jury management is very important and Paul didn't do that. This season was different than any other in a lot of ways https://t.co/rgPSu3oWoj
ED I love that you liked Cody. To me he didn't have to say anything. His expressions said it all. I would love to see him on all stars https://t.co/s6A9WoF3kX
Hahahaha. I was a bit super fan crazy. No lie. But I love my #BigBrother best reality show ever. https://t.co/fddcNIGIxQ
Tonya Harding would be epic. https://t.co/IbTHTKeGgQ
That was the best #RavenExposedParty I've seen yet lol. It's how we are all feeling. https://t.co/4br636MVcC
😂🤣👏🏻 https://t.co/kF2RxdQiYQ
@JasonJangyWang you were a class act on @MASTERCHEFonFOX  the entire season. Most beautiful &amp; creative dishes I have ever seen #stillawinner
That was a GREAT ending to #BigBrother19 Paul's face was priceless &amp; Cody winning AFP was perfect. Safe to say Paul knows the heat coming 😂
Getting that tv time in https://t.co/SLp26A8Yo0
I am so so sorry! :( https://t.co/lFnWNZN0YW
It would have been 9-0 if he took Christmas. But I'm SO happy Josh won! Paul's look was priceless https://t.co/06vujV3oQP
No clue who won just yet. But Alex scored big points with her snarky little comment. YES!!!!!👏🏻
Watching Paul's speech. Lol. Josh has no chance. Why in a million years would he be so foolish and not take Christmas who literally did zero
Yes. She is worthless even at the finale. Didn't even ask a real or valid question. https://t.co/Z8BUYyxuHJ
It's an unhealthy obsession 😂 https://t.co/9s8LqCWtIr
...andddddd I'm done. WORST season and players ever. Wtf was Christmas' speech? She made it about Paul more than herself. Idiots!
I'm a few min behind but Josh just won the last comp and if he takes Paul to top 2 I'm not sure I can justify watching another season
She's definitely a colorful character. I would enjoy her more without the dumb blonde act. I bet she's smarter than that. https://t.co/V0HCn1PVvj
You know what. I definitely see this happening https://t.co/x2Pg5LSL3m
"Hiding" that he's a super fan is his pitch to win? I don't think that was a secret. So excited to see how the finale turns out though https://t.co/m5zCmnoVM2
👏🏻 https://t.co/hD1xDGWg09
Finally watching #RHOD &amp; confused why this Kameron is on my TV. Her own husband looks like he hates her. Kindly, please leave, ma'am 👋🏼
A  Carney-engagement?! Oh, my. Is that what Dallas charity society world promotes?! Not even close. #RHODallas https://t.co/40J0x8hKS0
See. I'm 37 with no kids and @CaryDeuber makes me feel like I can have a baby. The scene tonight was great 👏🏻  hot wife &amp; amazing mama
I'm just so confused why no one except for Paul wants to win this game. #BigBrother19 https://t.co/pxNuTb9QRx
Ate pizza today for #NationalCheeseburgerDay and I'm not sorry about it at all.
When we finally did score my husband was so excited he spilled his beer on a Pats fan in front of us. I was like "ok, we can leave now" 😳 https://t.co/2YSTBdqv1F
Welllllll haha. Went to the superdome to watch the game. Everyone left 3rd Quarter 😫 https://t.co/Ripun62Tbm
Y'all this is the funniest thing ever. It gets better and better 🤣https://t.co/PM5LXe6lLX
Watching #BigBrother19 from last night. Raven "I haven't lied once in this game". Everyone: https://t.co/L2MLzQzbhn
Had to share. My favorite online boutique store is having a 50% sale starting tonight, y'all! https://t.co/uXvQkYPU6R https://t.co/t0DXZMuLDf
I feel like they aren't showing enough jury house footage. I want to see what Cody says when he sees everyone! "Told ya so" 😂 https://t.co/eaDeyZHH6M
Hahahahaha https://t.co/wZU2Fwh5On
Well yeah, there's Dean. But he's like 12 years old 😂 https://t.co/ccqkoF8OEN
Dead 😂🤣 https://t.co/UsyZhhnR3r
YES!! what she said: https://t.co/drvWywvS0f
Thank GAWD they ended it with Ben Z and his dog because this entire season would've been a waste. #BachelorInParadise #benzeus
I don't see how ABC still promotes a dating show with clowns like that. Daniel? Omg. I miss classy, gentlemen with great careers on the show https://t.co/gmXUsuf216
Dean: NOT GOOD ENOUGH. "I'm sorry. You're both great" 🙄That's why 25 year olds shouldn't go on that show. He deserves one of those twins
Really? I didn't get that! Haha. He just seems like a perfectly normal, smart, handsome guy. Sounds like marriage material to me! #BIP https://t.co/bUhu6t6GQ5
Ok what am I missing about Jack Stone? Why does no one like him? Am I wrong or is he the best looking, nice guy there? #BachelorInParadise
Oh hiiii!!!! https://t.co/ErgckTtdhv
Alex you're about 80 days too late to realize this. Everyone will be so angry at themselves when they watch the show. https://t.co/tR9CPLQ5yO
I have to say Xmas BC she's so smug about winning HOH comps that were thrown to her &amp; thinks she's way smarter than she is. Alex legit wins https://t.co/9JUqhBCFIN
You're sweet 😊 https://t.co/uyDMrtsx8O
Haha. I love talking about #BigBrother19 so I don't mind! It's such an interesting show. I'm a huge reality tv fan in general 💁🏼 https://t.co/tJ6ccjW3fg
Oh wow! Long time ago! Well hi again. Maybe I'll see you out and about in Nola. We are always doing something :) https://t.co/XACAxakmSl
Yes you def see more of who the cast really is. They protected Raven a lot too. It could've been so much worse. https://t.co/GoBYCCeRET
I don't! From Nola? I think Josh cries too much but if he gets Paul out he will win it. I adore Kevin but he hasn't done a single thing 🙁 https://t.co/FBCB38flxP
I keep forgetting that BC I follow the twitter feed updates 😂 https://t.co/kntfJSmWD3
I will agree at this point Paul is the only one who did anything to deserve to win even if I don't like his gameplay. https://t.co/54R2pAdwf4
I don't like his bully, isolate &amp; manipulate tactic &amp; I also think what's left of the cast are weak minded players. Xmas was thrown her HOHs https://t.co/54R2pAdwf4
Josh "the only way I can win is if I get rid of Paul" --doesn't get rid of Paul No one is playing to win. These people are AWFUL #friendship
Dead lol https://t.co/VJjvQN00Dx
This fake crying is the worst acting I've seen since my performance on Ninja Cheerleaders. 😂💁🏼
Dear Lord the uncontrollable sobbing by Josh is too much. Enough! #BigBrother19
I do not tell a lie! 💁🏼 100% she hated him. Listen to @KateCasey to see why https://t.co/bbfg00SiVE
Wes is actually someone I respect from the Challenges. He's very smart business wise &amp; has set himself up for a great future w/ or w/o MTV https://t.co/ncBON3AY2x
Now you're thinking, Josh. 👏🏻 #BigBrother19 https://t.co/htwkKQYmU9
Yeah I know the game so well I never missed a season. I don't think anyone else would have a chance 😂 https://t.co/HN0icrXMBp
Check out the podcast I did with @KateCasey tonight! See below! https://t.co/ZfbmCoRoet
Hahahaha. I know! @JulieChen maybe could have given a subtle "teeth check" 😂 https://t.co/8DgBrA2Ifq
This girl cannot be more off in so many ways. https://t.co/BknXv9VVqg
@WestonBergmann you would be great on Big Brother. I vote for that! https://t.co/5GCESbJ28N
Haha well thanks! But I don't think they would ask me since I criticized this season so much lol. I am a huge fan though! https://t.co/8Mqq6ci33a
STOP!!!! Celebrity Big Brother?! I die.
Oh I was too but knew that wasn't happening lol https://t.co/OqYfNbY99X
I couldn't love @JulieChen more for calling Raven out about her game 😂
Wowwww kevin was all ready to go home with his sport coat on! Lol. Can't say I'll miss Raven.
I totally would! https://t.co/zsSZRygXqE
Nothing in that house happens w/o Paul's knowledge. Alex deep down knows he sent Jason home &amp; is too scared to put him up. Very dumb https://t.co/3PGc6Ov0he
Yup. Alex wins and Paul immediately dumps Christmas and Josh to run up to her. These people are so blind. &amp; Of course she nominates kevin.
Hahaha. Well I don't like this cast but I love big brother! So I can't not watch. &amp; yes, Paul needs to go and he's fake as hell! https://t.co/C6Q3GvkBdG
Yaasssss the look on Alex's face was everything!!! #BigBrother19
No I know what he is protesting. No one is missing the point. But every team also has the right to not want to hire a mediocre QB...No? https://t.co/o326qIPD6r
So sick of hearing about @Kaepernick7 and his gf complaining that no one wants him. He isn't that good and no one seems to miss him. BYE 👋🏼
GREAT decision! I am so excited to see Arie! https://t.co/LiwUFuTMnN
Watch this trailer. This is why I suggest this event. Steve Gleason is a huge part of my city :)  https://t.co/IRNIVmiA4Q https://t.co/KWtI42VHGN
@TeamGleason is having Gleason Gras Friday night. And then a farm and table jamboree Saturday. There's always something to do in NOLA! https://t.co/2nBG0Ho98S
You have always been an awesome airline. I stayed in Montreal for almost 2 years and Air Canada has always been great. 👏🏻 https://t.co/Ju1Jk42Ble
But yes I see what you're saying. She probably won't be able to compete unless production gives her that. https://t.co/hJYH0Ms00v
I don't doubt she's great TV when she doesn't have a broken foot. I just hate the celebration after she was given 2 HOH. It was dumb https://t.co/hJYH0Ms00v
Yeah I did see that and assumed she had to have been a bad ass to have that many followers but her fake HOH wins were 🙄 https://t.co/ZAXuzAp6HD
Whaat? I mean. I don't have a great dating past either but I had no clue. She doesn't seem too torn up about it gloating about her free HOH https://t.co/7bFzazZkNz
They should've kept xmas for next season after her injury. Josh actually has gone from hating to semi hating. So that's good news https://t.co/1y9mBRTeUg
I have no horse left in this game but I'll root for whoever finally gives Paul the boot. BC in the end he's the only person that should win https://t.co/CApR6CNewR
Oh really? I didn't know that! Crazy! I thought she was this healthy crossfit person. Good note at least she's not an addict. Bad-she sucks https://t.co/R00GLuaN5H
She's def got some crazy in her. I would be terrified of her even with the broken foot and scooter 😳 https://t.co/wEPg2GkKFy
Yes I have to agree about scallops lol. I like her! They're all jealous BC they're in fake relationships and she got a ton of dates lol https://t.co/4JWnNhzU0w
I know! She's so mean lol. My husband would be like "whaaaaat" but I am jealous she hasn't done cardio in 80 days &amp; looks better than before https://t.co/ibjJUydgKP
Oh!!! Bachelor in Paradise. We were crossing reality shows. Sorry! Haha https://t.co/3fZNIjPpSb
Hahaha right?! And Christmas! Can you imagine dating her? She was so mean to Josh. "Do NOT ever do that again!" 😂 https://t.co/Kc9bdTK6tw
Agh! This house is so dumb! They care about Paul's safety over their own lol. They all deserve to go home and let him win 😫 #BigBrother19
This is heartbreaking. I hope we hear something soon. https://t.co/DZdTSfYlqn
Praying for Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Turks and all the other small islands. Hoping this storm dissipates before it gets to mainland US #Irma
Chicken of the Sea made her over the top famous. Of course she's smart, captain literal. https://t.co/JcCoSFMIGC
Literally no one except Tickle wants to date the twins lol. The dumb act was even lost on Jack Stone. Girls there can only be 1 Jess Simpson
Yes girl!!!! https://t.co/MVqRJz9M6K
Idk. Is Waboom a job? I liked when they picked actual bachelors who people would consider themselves lucky to date, not aspiring actors https://t.co/sZKY2N9L3d
Do us all a favor and pick a MAN that has a JOB and maybe health insurance? I can't see another Bachelor on DWTS. It's getting ridiculous 🤢 https://t.co/kVeY97y3VF
Haha well thanks! I really value my reality tv time between school work 😝 https://t.co/6zTfh4fmu0
I will not be happy with any ending other than Kristina and Wells getting married and having babies #BachelorInParadise
Enough with #ScallopFingers it wasn't funny last week and it's still not. #BachelorInParadise
I mean. How is a crazy person running the Dallas charity scene? 😂  I love the show but she and that Kameron are a head scratcher 🤔 https://t.co/XwgQ2xmbu6
Why anyone would go watch that LeAnne woman from #RHOD give a motivational speech is beyond me lol. I can't take any of that seriously 😂🤣
This is his big secret? 😂 it proves no one talks in this cast. So unaware. I think everyone knew by his zingbot reaction he was a superfan. https://t.co/XC2DtlNgL7
I forgot you were in the #BigBrother19 house until I just read this tweet. #fearless 🤣 https://t.co/6obi441V7R
I love how producers are desperately trying to get America to not hate them by using 20 min of footage of Alex scaring ppl in the house 🙄 https://t.co/aZhOIK2ItG
And she was so proud of her "2 wins" which made her look even more pathetic lol. I just don't enjoy anyone left in this cast. https://t.co/OsV0pn2WPd
Does Xmas really believe she's slick at all and anyone would believe a gimp would win a sprinting comp? This is such a joke #BigBrother19
I swear these people look like such  fools just staring blankly at Paul before they make any and every decision. #BigBrother19
Ok. Is Alex the most unintelligent person in BB history or does she have a master plan that we haven't seen in this season #BigBrother19 https://t.co/1zjqgYYHwn
I think it was a bad call for @CBSBigBrother to keep Christmas after her injury. This whole season is a disappointment. https://t.co/TKXXfpRoKq
Exactly! It was "obvious" to everyone. I'm so sick of this throwing comps so everyone can have a chance at HOH. This cast is terrible. https://t.co/bzGgiNuHKH
I had high hopes for Matt. I thought his looks/construction might be a great HGTV show. Now I think https://t.co/x3KY3mf54b
Oh Lawd, no Matt. That boy has no chance. He gave up 500k. How do you not see a person snack on crap all day and say they can't digest food
Awesome article about my Louisiana people helping during Houston floods. Worth a read  #CajunNavy #houstonstrong https://t.co/RJcUu1IwfQ
So sweet to see everyone's face when Jason doesn't use the Veto. Suck it Alex, Paul, and Christmas. P #BigBrother19
Seriously though. What is wrong with these people? Alex is the biggest bully I've ever seen on reality tv I believe. Hideous  #BigBrother19 https://t.co/rHXBYboR8i
I literally just spit out my water 😂 YES! They would lol https://t.co/BNXUgIWaGj
Hmm wonder if "reality" is sitting in about all the horrible things that were said/bullying/attacks and the repercussions after #BigBrother https://t.co/zULO43GrkT
#BachelorInParadise the girls are being mean to 1 girl BC she took leftover scallops &amp; ate them w her fingers. Seems normal to me 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/dyNnmtFuOa
I understand why the thought of food in general is horrifying for some of the girls there, but it's just a lil doggie bag yall. Let her live
Dean plays 2 girls, Jasmine wants anyone that looks at her, Raven screws over her friend &amp; Daniel is a pig, but DO NOT take scallops to go!🤔
That's actually the most believable thing she's said. It would explain some of the behavior that's for sure. #BigBrother19 https://t.co/sG0r9capOL
I don't think so either. He eggs them on to do his dirty work and lies about whoever he wants out, which ensues hatred from his minions. 🙅🏼 https://t.co/nKDNUlukNT
WHAT. Something is wrong with these people. Does Kevin deserve the entire house after him? Who would ever say something like that? Messed up https://t.co/Qkm4e26ZBs
Too late 🤗 https://t.co/xVsxCmmitH
Yeah they are still "together". I think ppl in the house think she's annoying and a compulsive liar. The thing this girl says. Unbelievable https://t.co/hFjez02JFW
These two...I don't even know what to say 😂 #BigBrother19 https://t.co/sbxjyeE6FQ
🤣 the dancing footage is my absolute favorite https://t.co/82Oza9y3Km
#mensa #BigBrother19 https://t.co/Jy1QGup2kg
Well done @CBSBigBrother on the Raven lying segment 👏🏻 it was pretty damn funny
Josh is slowly morphing into Paul. He constantly says "ya boy" now he's painting his nails black? So creepy #BigBrother19 🤢💅🏽
Hahaha. That's after Big Brother! https://t.co/1U1Vr649Zu
Whyyyyy does Raven bother wearing gobs of mascara during comps? 🤡🤡
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Houston right now. So sad to think of all the Katrina people who moved there dealing with this
I am a trophy wife. But pill popper not sure why he would say that. It's a false and defamatory allegation but proves his lack of maturity https://t.co/BGHzOZCI1u
Ok ok here are the people I can root for now. After my favorites left, I need to root for anyone who takes Paul out #BigBrother19 https://t.co/WIReSDP8Je
I'm so happy I'm following you now lol. Exactly my thoughts https://t.co/N0MIR7ZPJT
Thank you! It was a big brother tweet and I compared to someone I knew from MTV. I'm glad some people get it. 🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/saT0hZKh5k
No personal attack. Its my opinion I didn't say anything malicious R attacking his character I enjoy new ppl on shows so I can root for them
I was making a statement that I prefer new people on reality shows rather than vets BC it's an unfair advantage to mix the two. That's it.
OK guys. BC so many people have been offended by this, I do not dislike Johnny from the challenge. I hate I even have to defend this...
Also I find it highly suspect that people coming to defense on Johnny have 3 followers. Maybe someone has too much time on their hands 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/GvMSiHoBN2
True. I did too! But your life is so fulfilling and you have a beautiful family! Also I wasn't roasting anyone. Just a comparison lol https://t.co/GvMSiHoBN2
Girls lunch at Galatoires #nola #youcantsitwithus #hats https://t.co/IgIRHvKb73
She needs to drag Raven to the end along with Josh. If she facilitates Paul going home she deserves to win BC no one seems to want to do it https://t.co/3XxU97ESFv
I feel like she's going to the end regardless BC she can barely compete. She's made no big move. Why would anyone give her 500k? Idk 🤔 https://t.co/7eBtB4mOVm
So you think Mark was the right decision? Who goes next? Taking out Alex would have been great. She's the strongest player left. https://t.co/SPaqCznfjs
At this point those two just need to get married. You'll never know a person better than that moment 😂 https://t.co/m6lOP3n2n2
How did I miss all of this lol https://t.co/m6lOP3n2n2
Lol. Poor thing though. It's probably BC of her medication from her surgery! That's horrible. And also a little funny 😂😫🤔 https://t.co/qMBt7PzJ3X
Bahahahahaha what?!?!?? Did I miss this? https://t.co/uoMsTn0JgX
She should have evicted alex and made a deal with Mark so they could both team up w/ josh to then get paul out. Raven/Matt are no threat https://t.co/o8RYXfVpu1
If she didn't get hurt I think she would have been great but maybe the injury scared her? She does think she's making moves which is silly https://t.co/0n8dh12vLe
Lol. It did make me tear up a tiny bit BC his kid is pretty cute but yeah. Clearly nothing new in the house 😷 https://t.co/VxiluF0r9L
Lol. I know it's difficult but there's a major network out there called @CBS ... https://t.co/qmMuozywcM
That was a flippant comment about why I don't like seeing the same people on reality tv over and over and johnny came to mind. Thats it lol https://t.co/BYCerirqBj
I don't think I would enjoy Paul at all in real life. He said some things on live feeds that didn't sit well w me. Johnny I don't care about https://t.co/BYCerirqBj
I hate that! Lol But I also love that BC I know you love BB as much as me. I'm just not a vet fan. I love new people. Vets=unfair advantage https://t.co/HZw6YMTOFW
Yeah I forget about kevin. I'm afraid BC of the couples that he won't last though. Paul is out to get him and everyone will listen. Sheep. https://t.co/pmP1a17nJf
Now that Mark is gone I'm not sure who to root for? Maybe the first person to stand up to Paul? Maybe Alex BC she wins comps?
More importantly back to a show I actually watch #BigBrother19 am I the only one who fast forwarded through most of it? So predictable
I don't dislike Johnny. He's very entertaining. He just reminds me a lot of Paul on Big Brother. Pushy vet who can be super mean. It's true https://t.co/q6pF1RSK7H
Haha love you girl https://t.co/6LC0NxywLk
I stand by my opinion that there is a certain age where the challenge repeating makes you played out. My opinion. I'm not taking it back https://t.co/wdIsG1BM4W
I'm speaking to whoever said being on a challenge is better than having a career because of flexibility. My opinion is that it is not. https://t.co/d6K7KsEw8v
Degree in marketing, back in school for a second degree as a PA (physicians assistant). You should be impressed if you need medical care https://t.co/CLAnMkCDaE
Bahahahaha I love this https://t.co/qmMuozgVle
I've been on both sides. I prefer not looking like the old person on a challenge anymore to work and be guaranteed a great living. 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/ck9r5v8zLU
Here's a thought. Go back to school, get another degree in something that gives you health insurance AND flexibility? Tons of options... https://t.co/ck9r5v8zLU
There is absolutely no game play in antagonizing people, making false claims, and saying rude things in a speech knowing the player is going https://t.co/bH1WjxmCLr
That's awesome! I'm happy he stood up for Cody! https://t.co/GhG0IAKpya
And also her speech was rude. Mark took this week with class and respect and the way she threw him up just made her look like a total B
She had Mark, Josh and then Raven BC she won't vote for Matt. Christmas didn't have to even discuss with the other side. Such a bad move.
Christmas is such a fool! She automatically had the votes to backdoor Alex or Paul!  She would be tie breaker. This season is God awful.
I didn't start watching the feeds until after they were gone 🙁 but I heard Cody called someone f****t which I do NOT like either https://t.co/YWeeklyJYK
Exactly. It's a crappy thing to do and I also thought he made some comment about triggering PTSD or something? I could be wrong. https://t.co/CRacxtoKEq
https://t.co/LYuQF1kTol https://t.co/g58kY904CL
I don't think he's a good person. Both times he's played the game he has said awful things to people &amp; the military comment I can't forgive https://t.co/zu7ESgjXqP
Hahaha. Best tweet ever! https://t.co/CRKfQgOdWn
I think Paul=@MTVBananas an old guy trying to be cool again. Fans love vets on the show but people watching are unimpressed. #getarealjob
New boobs &lt; face #BachelorInParadise
When is Ben Z's dog coming on the show? I feel like I'm already emotionally invested in the dog. #BachelorInParadise
She's adorable, don't get me wrong. But the innocent act needs to go &amp; she clearly isn't looking for a husband with who she chooses 🤷🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/FczoMxL5mQ
...that is 100% on her. She went from someone who supposedly was abusive to a professional social media influencer? What does that even mean
But I wish everyone would stop feeling sorry for Amanda &amp; saying she deserves love more than other people-Really? She has awful taste in men
#BachelorInParadise I don't love the show, it's basically on in the background while I study &amp; I occasionally look up for awkward moments...
I'm 100% with you. They should've sent her home and brought her back another season IMO. She has done nothing but say "kitty boo boo" 🙄 https://t.co/DmP6S1ANLv
100% agree. I freaking love my #BigBrother19 https://t.co/W6koDusyS1
Hahaha. I know!! The sound people must hate them. 😂🤣 https://t.co/Asnu1iALgu
This girl... 🤣😂 https://t.co/xVVr7TdUsh
To be honest I'm not loving anyone that much this season. Of course I'm still a fan of the show, but no one really stands out positively IMO https://t.co/QUzANj0NZR
I didn't see that but YES it does 🙁 https://t.co/e0alUZEz0h
It's super easy. Watching a live feed of him making fun of veterans when my hubby is a fighter pilot is enough to make me dislike him. 💁🏼 https://t.co/tsPJXDmz9P
This #BigBrother19 cast is like a who's who of dog crap. Paul's name never mentioned once lol.
I love that Christmas has convinced herself that she's smart and doing something super new and bold in the #BigBrother19 game. Girl. Stop.
@deadskulltweets I dislike you a lot. I hope you see this very soon when you're at the jury house listening to Josh scream in your ear https://t.co/DKrM64gTPf
@JeanieBuss =Jeanie BOSS lady! She was such a smart, lovely woman. I love that she is a #BigBrother19 fan too. https://t.co/8ob79wF1Ur
Bahahahahaha https://t.co/p6hwuWfHjT
Best thing ever. Reminds me so much of my husband 😂 https://t.co/22Ry3BlhE2
The hymen thing is hilarious though. I had to watch twice. Cody's face when Jess asked if she still had one lol #BigBrother19
Lol Ramsey. That kid is adorable!! The montage of him and Matt 😂🤣 #BigBrother19
Paul calling Mark out was the perfect time for Mark to say in front of everyone that Paul is controlling all of them. Wtf. He just took it 👺
Hahaha yeah! I totally thought about you. https://t.co/KC99nP63XU
Every one of my guy friends are so jealous 😂💁🏼 https://t.co/cwJHscRx1t
Well thank you! That was very kind :) https://t.co/3FGrRj4TVt
You always have a place to stay in Nola now! Would love to get together soon :) https://t.co/Jmfb69D8Nz
🤣😂 https://t.co/COVWrAX1it
That was so much fun! Thanks again. Always a good time talking #BigBrother https://t.co/sw034zKEhF
I am too. It was so cringe worthy when Jason just ran right up to Paul to tell him about Kevin. My dog takes more time begging for treats 🙄 https://t.co/46R2yeYPyN
Right?! It seems that way. At first Alex was my favorite but she disappointed me by being such a lackey. She is not a strategic player https://t.co/0GXeI7Im8o
It is my all time favorite reality show! https://t.co/EohVHFtNRO
Last night #bigbrother19 wasn't a shock. Let's see if Alex wakes up and back doors Paul. Cody 100% going on block. Maybe Elena? Thoughts?
I have never had a problem with Cara Maria she is an awesome competitor. But I do love Camilla. She's fun in the house and has personality https://t.co/UFdowbIqm9
Agh! I'm so pissed off I can't even sleep after this episode. I streamed it from my vacay BC it's my fav show. I'm so pissed. https://t.co/RPizLYNXzs
For me the only good thing that came out of the non RW/RR people is Camilla. She has enough personality to actually be on a show. I love her https://t.co/z6gtmLxQ7z
1st episode I thought Matt was going to plow through that house. But he hasn't done anything which sucks. I hated Jess ep 1 now she's my fav https://t.co/yqBKUPQAVI
To be fair, AYTO was way after my show. And I'm 37 so I get it. But a lot of the challengers are old as hell too lol. I personally miss RR https://t.co/y11CIBHpZr
But yes. I agree w/ you. Everyone is sucking at Paul's teet and it's gross. Raven and the other guy I don't even know his name are the worst https://t.co/QYjn95i4fc
Personally I'm a Cody/Jess fan BC they aren't floaters and don't apologize and also are amazing at comps. Social game is off though 😳 https://t.co/QYjn95i4fc
I don't watch the new Challenge BC mainly I don't agree with putting non RW/RR people on the show. Also most of them are horrible humans 💁🏼 https://t.co/yqlnfoKxVO
I'm dying here. Why was there zero talk of a back door Paul?! These people are so foolish! Raven?! Really. Just. Really. 🤔🙄 https://t.co/uvsrUtrPjQ
Agh! As if Bachelorette wasn't bad enough...my FAV show #BigBrother19 just killed me. Really? No talk of Paul on the block?! So dumb
She totally just #bachelorblocked Peter lol "I don't think this show is for you" 🤣 I can't!! Poor guy. #TheBacheloretteFinale
I think so too. Maybe after this all cools down she will explore that. He seems like a really good guy. https://t.co/Irv3UoToDt
Yikes. She comes off SO surly and bitter. Not a cute look. She totally chose the ring over the love and it's obvious. #TheBacheloretteFinale
STOPPPPP https://t.co/G7JZHWuiRA
Lol. Is Neil Lane holding her hostage or something? I don't understand why she is forcing it so much? She comes off very pathetic looking. 😪 https://t.co/ncC0t1Sq0s

#BornThisWay best show on television. Heartwarming, funny, and I'm sitting on the edge of my seat wondering wth is going on w Megan &amp; Steven
@_cori_ander I agree with you. I guess when I watch @TheView I want to see both sides instead of people placating the strong women. I love a good debate
I'm so confused by some of the women on #TheView I know Joy and Whoopie's political stance but the others flip flop a lot. Hard to follow 😳
Noooooooo not Frederick 😫 he is literally the cutest and sweetest guy! Ugh. I hope he meets a nice girl. So sad for him #TheBachelorette

Seriously. That was stupid. Like even my girls softball coach would have been upset. You don't swing at those pitches! Let it go runner on 3

@dannywilk1 @Clio_the_Leo why so hard for people to believe a straight man can have a close friendship with a gay man? Z is clearly straight
“@pjones102: @TrishelleC  I do!!! i always root for the good guy and am always disappointed” same here! Lol
“@Clio_the_Leo: EGADS Donny! Go work Chris/Vic for a vote! #bb16” seriously every time I read feed updates he's sleeping wtf lol

“@MichaelPMcD: @TrishelleC Are you on a flight to New Orleans right now? #creepytweet” yes why?
“@BigBrotherLeak: Donny quietly to self: "Wait, did she say 99 problems?" #BB16” I couldn't love him more
@AuntieSmel yes she talked to Julie and if it is at all possible, yes, she has become more annoying than the last time you saw her on CBS
Omg Rachel R? I thought the world was done with her! And when did she turn into a 45 yr old soccer mom? "Sisters before misters, RIIGHT" ugh
I love this #BB16 cast though. They look like they have so much fun. I had to rewind Zach &amp; Nicole in the kitchen w/ the #BBZombie twice 💀
Side note. Victoria is the best seat filler in #BigBrother history. Why does Julie even bother ever asking her questions? Lol
I mean. Am I the only person who adores Donny and really wishes he would step up his game and win? #BigBrother #CBSBigBrother
@MrBrianEC1978 you too! Xx

@MileHighGayGuy @AneesaMTV lol wow. I've been on tv for 11 yrs &amp; never had a racial issue. I'm not race intolerant I'm Aneesa intolerant
@MileHighGayGuy @AneesaMTV I didn't watch so I have no clue what you're talking about.

“@EmaZajmo: @TrishelleC @PLAYGROUNDPOKER Gl !!! I'm coming on Thursday ! See u there Xxxx” yay! DM me when you're here xx

Back @PLAYGROUNDPOKER trying again to make it through to day 2. @FullTiltPoker event 1!!
@ThatCoral @HowCanI @BunimMurray @MTV ditto on you coral :)
Just watched the @TeamGleason special on @espn and cried. Always feel inspired to hear the story of such a special "saint" @Saints
“@WillToy23: @TrishelleC misses Betamax, VHS, and floppy disks.  Also misses her Zach Morris cell phone. 📞💾📼” car phone. Attached to the car
@flkfsf sidekick is like the OG Nintendo. I would actually pay good money for one now. Not that it would actually work haha
“@BobTRY: @TrishelleC ya I wish I still had my sidekick mail pictures !! Haha” oh snap. We had a few I'm sure lol
“@MichaelCeledon: @TrishelleC next, you're gonna say you miss AIM..” ...and... I really do lollll. Wow. I'm def over 30 hahaha
@flkfsf no they didn't tell us who. And no one on the team was allowed to say :/ honestly they would've won the entire challenge.
It made me feel so powerful to flip open my sidekick like "what. What's your problem" it made cool sounds. I miss that thing!
You know what I miss? My sidekick. I really miss my T-Mobile Sidekick. Anyone with me on this?
I don't know why but it pisses me off how much they're pushing this new iPhone. I'm  comfortable w my 3Gs. Why you gotta make me feel bad?
There's a lot of boob talk going on in here @ElectricAlizee @lovesto_shop @MarcAndre_FDawg
@nickpisani13 aww. Well thank u!! :)
Oh @Saints you are amazing
“@shanewest_1: .....the @Saints #NewOrleans game! #GeauxSaints #whodat @nfl” missing Louisiana right now!
“@chubbsmcfats: @TrishelleC have you been to La Garde Manger or Le Bremner yet?” No!! I cook a lot actually :)
@MariaHo THE WORST! PS why when you're past 25 to u all of a sudden have to get up to pee during the night/morning? Ugh #oldpeopleproblems

@cancermtl great event last night! Where can we see the pictures?
@Anna_Lillie I'm so excited! Such a good idea
Finally catching up on @MASTERCHEFonFOX how does a cooking show make me cry?! Sad to see @MC4Jessie leave but she needs a cooking show.
“@chubbsmcfats: @elizastillman @TrishelleC Howard wasn't vile or disgusting.” No he wasn't and he left with class and dignity
@chubbsmcfats @elizastillman I didn't dislike Elissa at all but I think she had a huge edge with votes &amp; kind of unfair but good for her
“@itsWillyFerrell: You know you're amazing when people you don't even know hate you.” THIS all day long. Sad for some people but true!
“@Chet_Cannon: Hi @Harry_Styles.  What do think about Obamacare?” Bahahhahaha. Ohhhhhh Chet
@joels71 I support Andy from a game stand point. I can really care less what he thinks about someone's children. He played a great game IMO
@fratzner @JUDDNATION I just said that. But thanks lol
@JUDDNATION aww haha tell him I love him too but he will be disappointed in me to watch that haha.
“@girlposts: channing tatum: i'm your husband, you were in a car accident me: ok” hahahahahaha. Love this.
@DarkKard4 @AndyHerren U people are such babies. I always like controversial people on reality shows. It's GREAT tv! Obv u don't do casting
“@SugahbearCraw: @TrishelleC nice that reality legends watch big brother who was your fave HG?” I liked Andy, Judd, Amanda, &amp; Helen the most
@joels71 @AndyHerren hate? Everyone on tv has hate. People love to hate people they wish they could be. Andy was the best player by far!
Tomorrow starts the @FullTiltPoker festival @PLAYGROUNDPOKER with a $150 100k gtd tourney! Ill be playing everyday. Who's coming??
@AndyHerren congrats doll. Was rooting for you! I know you'll do amazing things with your prize money :)
@DarryllFish @Roothlus ok. Well you guys have to get out for at least one day lol. Lets go to a hockey game or drinks on terrace at least!
@DarryllFish when are you coming to Mtl??
@chubbsmcfats well her sister/bro in law  was on big brother and they got people to vote. So yes she was lucky for that.
Successfully avoided twitter until I watched the finale of big Brother. I'm glad Andy won! I wish Judd got Americas fav player though :(
“@Eric_n_Stuff: @TrishelleC Just watched Ninja Cheerleaders for the first time. Solid performance. What a great movie.” Thanks! :)
@EdwinMontanez @Andy love u for saying that :)
@EdwinMontanez @Andy apparently more of this stuff happens to me lol. I'm a magnet for gay men. Not that I'm complaining! ;)
@MaxBohbot @PLAYGROUNDPOKER no way! Next time u better say hello :) I should come this weekend for the full tilt tournaments!
“@MaxBohbot: Just saw @TrishelleC at @PLAYGROUNDPOKER!” Why didn't you say hi?! Haha
@MariaHo @jfordtx miss u soooo much. Please u and the boy come visit in Montreal
@PLAYGROUNDPOKER tonight for Deepstack turbo and also to see my love @bri_poker
@lovesto_shop @GaelleJaudon we got back last night :) lets go to a hockey game or out this week!

So excited to be back in Montreal for @FullTiltPoker event @PLAYGROUNDPOKER starting this Saturday! I plan on being there everyday :)
@lovesto_shop what?! You're in Montreal? Sam and I live in the same building you're in!
He got second. Now to see if we make our flight lol.
@RobinHibbard14 @KatieDoyle26 we are great! She's wedding planning &amp; I'm in Africa but hopefully I will see that nugget soon! :)
We are supposed to fly out of Dakar, Arica in 2 hours but Sam is heads up in the mini HR tournament here. Guess its a good problem to have!
My handsome and I on the safari yesterday. Zebra behind us u can barely see. Was such an awesome experience! http://t.co/lbIlxopAji
“@V1_man: @susie_meister @TrishelleC  I could have used this sweet syrup with my waffles this morning.  :)  #nicepeople” thanks Dave :)
@susie_meister heed the advice sister hahaha. Loved our convo. Love you :)
Photo proof: he was really excited about it. And oddly, I didn't mind. http://t.co/ga9AuuHPeU
Today on the safari my bf insisted I take a photo of rhino poop. And I had to laugh bc I thought. Wow. I must have met my match. Lol. Weird?
People to flush so I could see it. And I would study if. (Heard from fam members) and my mom thought I was going to be a doctor (of poop?)..
I have a confession to make. And in the end it has a point: when I was little I've been told I was obsessed with poop. Like I didn't want...
“@bri_poker: @TrishelleC btw my hair is black now :/” you're beautiful! U could die it pink/purple &amp; still be #lesbihonest lol
@CoralieNauder do it pretty girl
@jfordtx guuurrrrrrl he done already had that fantasy key. Lol. Maybe I should've waited for the ring first! My step mom is always right lol
@jfordtx lolllll no elephants or lions here :/
Went on a little African safari today. Saw these guys from our truck.  @bri_poker I thought of you!!! http://t.co/uCPbu3tooh
@ChanMix123 we told reception &amp; they did nothing. There was a camera right above our door too so this should not have happened
@ChanMix123 then the door bell rang later and I went to look and it was a Spanish guy and I said hello again and he left lol.
@ChanMix123 when Sam was deep in the HR I was in the hotel &amp; twice someone who wasn't housekeeping walked in &amp; left when I said hello. Weird
@WillToy23 omg. That's awful :(
“@jonathanbaker: @TrishelleC I was there on Amazing Race !!!” Did u like it? I think it's pretty cool.
“@patrick55721: @TrishelleC so??? did you find her? just sayin/ wondering” not really. It says she's had a rough few months with health :/
“@JennCleveland: @TrishelleC don't worry, I wonder that when I'm wide awake. Ha” hahahahahaha
You know you have terrible jet lag/insomnia problems when you're googling "where is Tila Tequila"
Went fishing in Dakar, Senegal in Africa today and stopped at this cute little beach on an island. #nofilter http://t.co/iaD0BYF7eS
“@michaeldfuller: @TrishelleC Um, what?” One of the @cnn top stories. Sickos.
2 teenage girls put a kitten in the microwave and tweet it?! Wtf is wrong with people? Future murders for sure. Lock these kids up!
“@JosephineLiszt: @TrishelleC Do u mean thrown challenges on #Rivals2 ?  Or previous seasons?” Both. The shows r getting worse.
@Williebugz88 I receive plenty. I follow certain ppl as courtesy and support as a friend. They don't need to abuse that.
Just favorite the tweets. Your friends don't care what Susie from Saratoga thinks about u! We get it. U got nice comments. Good job on that
It's so annoying when ppl RT a bunch of nice things strangers say about them. I don't need my feed clogged w that crap. Are u that insecure?
Le sigh. Bubbled the tournament. QQ on the button and ran into aces in bb. Sucks to be me tonight :/
Yay doing pretty decent. Doubled up pretty quickly now a little above avg with 27 left. 12 pay.
About to start day 2 of Dakar Poker Tour deep stack event! Coming in hot with 16bb. 😁
Made day 2 of the Dakar Poker Tour deepstack. Coming back with only 16bb. Need to run it up!!
@JosephineLiszt haha well thank you. It was crappy leaving Sarah but I had to. Other ppl threw challenges to go home for the same reason
@JosephineLiszt no :/ unfortunately I can't say because of my contract and they will sue me. Lame.
“@CoralieNauder: A "souvenir"  Night In Barcelona , lot Of girls In my bed 😉 @GaelleJaudon @TrishelleC http://t.co/z43hf3HXMm” love this!
“@TheMarkLong: The OVER 30 #MTV #CHALLENGE CLUB...am I really retired from it all??? Read and share... http://t.co/Gtmob63d5b @mtv” me too?
“@SallySeyeWhat: @TrishelleC so nice meeting you tonight!! I hope I can show you all the fun things Dakar has to offer :)” thank u so much!
“@GaelleJaudon: @Liv_Boeree @yadio1111 ahahahah sooo good!!!!” Hilar
They just had an altercation with Asians at the casino in dakar. Obv I was watching. Maybe my US status here gets thumbs up after this.
“@bri_poker: thinking about you @TrishelleC ❤” I miss u. Sooooo much
“@utopia4evr: @TrishelleC @TeamSarahOnBGC admit it! u just want the showmance! lol” haha. BB showmances are the best. I have to admit :)
“@TeamSarahOnBGC: @TrishelleC If you ever got asked would you do Big Brother?” Yes!!! It's my fav reality show :)
@OuatteDePhoques hahahahahaha. He told me that! I die. So funny
“@OuatteDePhoques: @TrishelleC haha now that is something” going deep sea fishing in a few days. Promise good Sam stories :)
“@jonathanroy70: @TrishelleC What!!!!! lollll whats the buyin” it's like 5k which is like 500 :)
“@DavidManigo: Hey @TrishelleC, did you see what happened to Carter Gill?” No! What??
Playing poker tournament in Dakar, Sengal in Africa. This is definitely a first lol. Beautiful place though! Right on the ocean.
@pizza5evr @ginweirick @ericstonestreet thank you so much! :)
@DevynSimone but the pistachios in chocolate were heaven lol
@Angrow4278 I miss y'all too! I hope to be home in October! Ill let u know for sure :)
So sad to be missing all this football! Leaving Barcelona tomorrow and will be flying during the Saints game 😢
@fratzner @RachelEReilly @amandabynes hahahahahaha. Love
oh hello! @constantcolorup  http://t.co/FVMPRXB5wf”
@caity414 @aaronpaul_8 he likes poker too :) I met him like 8 years ago
@back2backflack @JeffMadsenobv y'all have to stay for the falcons/saints game! I'm so jealous. Wish I was with u guys right now :/
“@Frank13Caisse: @TrishelleC Hey T ! Keep us updated on Sam in the HR plz ! #onetime” he has 20 bb at final 2 tables. 16 left!
@PokerStarsEPT @EPTLive 10k HR!
@ThatsSoTaguchi of course I do. But I don't like the 14,567 RTs from "fans" saying how amazing her sister is. That's annoying so I unfollow
Started following @RachelEReilly 4 the same reason as @amandabynes bc every1 loves a trainwreck, but her tweets 2nite made me unfollow #rip
@murtzjaffer I will say that if I were Rachel I'd be PISSED too if ppl said mean things about my family. It's really mean to attach family
@murtzjaffer @xederya I'm missing the live feed stuff. But ppl throw stuff around a lot of reality shows. Unfortunately that's normal lol
@xederya @murtzjaffer right I mean. These ppl left r obv not model citizens but its reality tv. Now rooting for McCrae or Spencer to win.
“@ChadLindberg: @TrishelleC You tell em...;)” I'm serious about my tv watching Chad!!! Lol
Hey. If u don't like my opinions about Big Brother then don't f***ing follow me. I'm probably not following you.
@obviousbicycler @Madden529 @murtzjaffer ok well she is only there bc of her sisters fans &amp; bc of America's vote. That's unfair 4 the others
@murtzjaffer eh. I mean that &amp; bc of her sister she stayed longer w America's vote. Kind of unfair to ppl with non reality tv relatives lol
“@Madden529: @TrishelleC @murtzjaffer how do u know "she doesn't need the money?"” Do your research. Google it
“@murtzjaffer: Judd, you say Elissa didn't deserve to be there?  YOU WERE ALREADY VOTED OUT!  #bb15” agree on this But she doesn't need 500k
@OuatteDePhoques thanks for the heads  up! That's crazy.
“@JunDishes: Is Aaryn's black friend straight or gay?” I seriously love your tweets. Lol
@KellyAnneJudd no! I'm so sorry :/
@bri_poker miss u so much. U don't know! 😭
@neevbaram how do I get in touch w you?
@MadMarvin @victorramdin take me next time you go!!
@kellymack this is why I follow you
@Clio_the_Leo good. I hate when ppl say things are unpatriotic. It's not like you're burning the flag by wanting to live somewhere else lol
@cokomoko97 @Clio_the_Leo Ew! If Judd said that I'm no longer a fan. That's the most ignorant, redneck, thing ever. Dual cit is a privilege!
“@BJNemeth: @Jtillathekilla2 He made it! @PhilLaak is at the televised WPT Final Table with a LOT of chips.” Yes!!!! Go Phil!
@WesMTV that happens to me a lot actually. I must have awful dreams. Any explanation for this?
“@The_DFish: Later LA, next stop Montreal! #WCOOP” yay!! Can't wait to see you boys again!
“@EricaTheRose: Its sad that the most intimate interactions I've had today are with people I pay to hang out with me (trainer &amp; therapist)”
@RealHOverbyBB15 u went out with class! Be proud of that! USM golden eagles represent! :)
“@BARLOW253: @TrishelleC @HotelArtsBcn that beach look like a thong booty” lollll. It really does!!
View from our room at @HotelArtsBcn http://t.co/G6rX1yo1mN

“@jonathanroy70: EPT Barcelona Main Event today! 4 handed so far with @JasonMercier on my left #jbl” GL boys!! Xx
@Clio_the_Leo so it's certain Amanda is gone? &amp; is it a double elim week? I'm so lost. In Barcelona right now &amp; can't watch :/
@Julia_In_NYC you'll have to find a saints bar in NYC!
“@Julia_In_NYC: @TrishelleC you ready for Saints football Trishelle!?” Sept 8! Can't wait!!!
“@jfordtx: @TrishelleC  Um yeah, that's 7 hrs. Anything longer than 2-3 hrs can no longer be referred to.as a "nap".” I know. Ughhhh
@bconley3 probably about 6 months. Way too long!
So sad I'm missing the @lsu game but ill be updating @espn every few minutes. Geaux Tigers!!
I am the worst at beating jet lag. Took a "nap" at 8 pm &amp; just woke up at almost 3 am. Missed the @pokerstars party. Annoyed.
@GOPBlackChick Great time for me to be in Europe lol
I always seem to be across the world when the US decides to intervene using force. Being American anywhere you already lose points. Yikes 😳
Busto ladies event AK&lt;KQ. Boo. Now news to get ready for the @PokerStars party tonight! #eptbarcelona
“@constantcolorup: Short with 28 left” gogogo!! Double soon!

“@bebe_chien: Playing the Estrellas high roller today! Gl everyone!!! #vamos” GL :) ill come say hi! Besos
@MarcAndre_FDawg @Roothlus @Pass_Lefrancois Adam! Will the wifey be joining? U know I'm in Montreal with Sam now! :)
@MarcAndre_FDawg stop it with that buffet talk!! 1 more day for me :) #fatkidatheart
@Jtillathekilla2 haha I love you two. Are y'all coming to Barcelona?
@The_Conv @ept @eptlive @PokerStarsEPT Lollllll. Omg. This made my day.
@The_Conv @ept since we didn't get to in vegas, we need to catch up with a cocktail or 10 in barca! Lmk when you're not busy-if that happens
“@EmileeMTV: Auntie Kris! Its me... Todd Krane!!!!” Hahaha. That was actually hilarious.
“@Chet_Cannon: Hi @Sanjaya!” Chet. I adore u lollll
“@stephenfishbach: @TrishelleC http://t.co/Q2E7u4eTk6” love!
I love that ppl hate me for leaving the challenge yet I'm going to a beach in Barcelona tomorrow &amp; these clowns are tweeting about the show!
“@anna_carpio_xo: @TrishelleC have you had paella yet? You MUST if you're  in Barcelona!” I will! Near Arts hotel they have a great place!
In Barcelona. Can never get used to the jet lag from North America &amp; Europe. Currently having a beer. 4 am is the same as 5 pm here right?!
@AshleeFeldman Aaryn. But I think Elissa played top emotionally putting her up. Mcranda was her target #eyesonprize
“@SOOPERSTAR13: @TrishelleC FLOATER Andy is getting on my nerves now...” Yes. And he will go soon. No loyalty. No direction. Gameplay is bad
@SOOPERSTAR13 Elissa has made some good moves in competitions. She's not bad! Her worst move game wise was that. #BigBrother
“@erinashley3493: @GOPBlackChick you are one PSYCHO HALF BREED CRAZY ASS BITCH!!! Lol” these people Crystal. Clueless and terrible. Lol
@frankcsweeney lover. U did the show. U don't need to watch the edits. U know what happened and who these ppl are! Don't let anyone confuse
@nygiantsfan2012 I broiled the shrooms. Poached eggs and sautéed spinach, garlic, onions w/ bacon. Parm cheese on top &amp; hollandaise sauce!
@SOOPERSTAR13 I think she plays too much with emotions. She should've put up Mcranda. Her vengeance against Aaryn will kill her game
“@theluckybrown: @TrishelleC Ok nice, I will come soon. I never go to playground. ;) @PLAYGROUNDPOKER” u have to! Great poker there
“@theluckybrown: @TrishelleC Hi, you play at playground poker?” All the time!! @PLAYGROUNDPOKER
“@chubbsmcfats: @MC4Jessie The camera absolutely adores you. You belong in front of it on your own show.” Agree. Love her. She needs a show
@JonathanDuhamel see you soon!
“@KevinMacPhee: Reykjavik!” Coolest city ever. And yes the girls are hot. And pretty wild :)
“@Ssull33: @TrishelleC thinking about planning for Full Tilt Fest Main. Do you think it's worth the trip from Maine?” Yes 100%!!
“@xxl23: @TrishelleC hehe I always joke about that too :)” see you there?
Flying to Barcelona tonight w/ Sam for #EPT10 #eptbarcelona hope we run better than last year! #luckyinlove #unluckyinpoker
@Montreal we took a boat out of old port a few times and its a really nice view of the city. Especially at night.
“@bri_poker: wishing my very very good friend @TrishelleC , a wonderful trip to Barcelona . bring home some moneyyyyy! :)” will miss u! Xx
Last night @PLAYGROUNDPOKER 'til end of September was pretty good to me at the cash tables. Happy to have a lil to play with @ #eptbarcelona
“@Clio_the_Leo: No better way to end the day than w/some Canada bashing to keep us free!!!” :/ I LOVE Canada!!! Like. A lot.
@KeyleeStyle omg! I remember that was the first "dirty" movie I saw and my aunt caught me watching it on HBO and got so mad! Lol
@NickDiVella ok so you can't fill it with water at all? That's a deal breaker for me. Give me wine and water in it twice a day and I'm good
@NickDiVella @PokerNews hahaha! My bfs condo only has a shower. I seriously can't deal. I'm excited to travel for tourneys for the bathtub!
“@bri_poker: busted 17th :( @PLAYGROUNDPOKER” but now she's killing it at the cash tables!
@bebe_chien @MarcAndre_FDawg @dannysuied11 see. Marc looks like a lil baby! Too cute :)
@PokerNews @NickDiVella are u kidding?! This is a woman's dream! Sitting in a bath for days w/ no phone or people &amp; food delivered? Done.
“@scooter5000: @TrishelleC @jamiechung1 @SouthwestAir i miss you baby.  hows the poker tourney?” Lost a tourney but winning at cash now :)
@Clio_the_Leo can I just say I am SO glad I'm following you now!!! :)

@MySharona1987 @radar_online bahahahahaha
I have to give it to the #Kardashian girls. These chicks put up with a TON of crap &amp; still stand by their men. Can't say I could. #respect
“@MySharona1987: @TrishelleC @radar_online Note to Lamar: if you want a private life, don't marry a Kardashian.” Right?! What did he expect?
“@radar_online: #EXCLUSIVE: @RealLamarOdom Believes #Kardashian Family Leaked #Drug Stories" Seriously?! No! Really? Lol #KrisJennerrulesall

@matteo_ventura I'm livid lol
“@28lat: @TrishelleC it was on Tv38 because of football.” Omg. I'm dying. Wtf. How.
Um. Did I miss #BigBrother tonight? My DVR didn't record but I see people tweeting about it?? Confused
“@slickvik2009: @TrishelleC how old is she and what age does she say.lol” she's been 26 for like 4 years lol
“@rubencolunga: @TrishelleC I've always wondered why Diem lies about her age also. Hmm...” That is ridiculous! Own it! I hate liars!
@OumaimaJogia @Chet_Cannon hahaha. No but he is a great, hilarious, hot guy :)
@Fresh_Peaches my fav used 2 be Amanda but now shes bullyish, Elissa-less annoying, Andy-cries 2much, Helen-manipulative. I'm so confused!
@mtvfranksweeney U are a loyal and honest person which is more than I can say for the liars &amp; cheaters who BMP make look so great. It's sad
@mtvfranksweeney Do not listen to these ignorant, cowardly ppl who tweet strangers like they know u or know anything about tv! I love u :)
@GriffinBenger that is exactly what I thought when I saw it!!! Lol. What a freaking mess. (But good movie)
“@Mykal444: @TrishelleC She'd be everyone's favorite if she hadn't made the racist comments.” Agree. Now she has to live with that though
“@CoreyIversen: @TrishelleC right?!? She's a BEAST and the only likable one left” she totally rolled over Spencer! It was hilarious
And I know everyone hates Aaryn but she is crazy good at these competitions. #BigBrother
Just watching #BigBrother SO sick how Elissa just went from being under water to beating Helen who was half way up the ramp! Damn!!!
@EricGolfs def XXX Vitamin water!!! I try to drink one everyday

“@Mikedoyle95Mike: @TrishelleC Are you playing in the Full Tilt Festival main event?” Yes 100%! Are u?
Playing the Friday night bounty @PLAYGROUNDPOKER tonight while my baby plays in the private game. Haven't final tabled in too long! #letsgo
My BFF @KatieDoyle26 is engaged!! I'm so excited for her an my new brother and my first time being a maid of honor! Let the planning begin!
Nothing pisses me off more than fakeness! Helen blowing kisses to everyone when she votes them out is too much. Just be real, girl!
Wow. Jessie could've brought the house down tonight! She was super shy. I respect the classy move but letting ppl know about Helen was key!
@nickvitt let's do! Following u now and DM me
@nickvitt you are so sweet! I'm in Montreal a lot so if you're around let's meet up! Xx
“@nickvitt: @TrishelleC 100% sure I saw you at a water park in Quebec today and died a little inside.” Yup! That was me!!
@iamKimmieHo @TMZ @eonline @peoplemag don't they have interns to monitor these comments?
So angered by some of the horrific comments made about Gia's death. @TMZ do something about this! No one should read that. That's just awful
RIP Gia. You were a beautiful person and Christian and I will see you in heaven when my time is up! Prayers for your family
@3NolesFan3 that is an awful thing to say for someone fighting for their life. This is reality. You are sick.
Not really sentimental on twitter but sad to hear about @GiaAllemand please again pray for her. She's so young and so good. Energy needed!
@cadillaccannon Johnny is cool enough to act like he's 21. Me? I'm not cool! I'm a nerd. I'm def 33 lol
@cadillaccannon I'm 33. Johnny is also 33 or 32. Aneesa is 32. Diem is 31 I think but she says she's younger. I don't ever lie about my age
@Mr_Shidla lol. Right?! But I wanted to cover the kids eyes when I saw the hippos "mating"! I am for sure old. The parents were laughing lol
“@EricGolfs: @TrishelleC for some reason I laugh thinking of you saying "boning". Not sure why....” Boning is old. But I am old lol. I'm 33!
@michaeldfuller @DeadlineTV anything and everything from @NicholasSparks is amazing. I hope you have something to do with this, Fuller?
“@LGrahamCTV: Severe T-Storm WARNING on for #Montreal #Laval #Longueuil Take cover!” City looks scary! http://t.co/tvPBsyTpOS
@JuicyJarome @jakepavelka1 @GiaAllemand I don't know but prayers are needed!
2 hippos boning at Grandby Zoo while very confused kids watched. #Trauma #birdsandbeestalk http://t.co/iKg9qtZf9E
@xederya @MoneyMichelle @GiaAllemand yes. I just read. Hope she is ok. Many prayers for her!
“@zachboom3141: @TrishelleC I knew that would be a giraffe before I clicked on it.” Lol lies!!!!
“@Rebel88boy21: @TrishelleC what zoo was it?” Grandby Zoo in Canada!
Went to Grandby Zoo all day today but still managed to make it to @PLAYGROUNDPOKER for the 6-max. This may be a short night for me lol
@slam_azing oh I didn't know that! Makes sense though. She's def a chameleon which is good but she plays too hard I think
@Skinutt44 hahaha. I like the drama with the showmance. I like to watch people that everyone hates. It's good tv! It's all edited anyway
@IAmAmySuter you're awesome! Thank u so much!
@Skinutt44 lol. I was seriously panicking haha. Ok glad to know he didn't put up McCrae and Amanda :) thank u!
@Rebel88boy21 what happened at the end? Last I saw Helen was telling Andy to put up McCrae &amp; Amanda. 60 Minutes ruined everything! Lol
Now I'm freaking out. Stupid 60 Minutes ruined my dvr recording of the last 10 minutes of #BigBrother wtf happened?! Bah!
Helen is the smartest one, IMO. She has manipulated people into making "big game moves" and she's not even HOH! #BigBrother
Helen is amazing at popping up everytime someone is crying to tell them how they are "awesome" &amp; going to win the game #BigBrother
Has anyone seen the movies "The Attack" or "Before Midnight"? Debating on seeing one of the two &amp; they both have 90% plus ratings
@lucasfrid Montreal

@V1_man @SammiGWV @EvelDick @TheMarkLong thanks Dave! :)
@SammiGWV @EvelDick @TheMarkLong your baby is ugly. Just living up to the reputation
@EvelDick @erikaelizabethh omg. That is awful.
@EvelDick @TheMarkLong yes! Follow me so I can DM u
@erikaelizabethh @EvelDick oh yeah I forgot she said that and didn't know Candice was adopted. Yeah that is kind of harsh lol
@EvelDick omg. People are mad about that?! Lol. That was good tv! These twitter fans are so sensitive. Idiots lol
@Gina_Zimmerman @EvelDick did I miss something on big brother feeds?!
“@kikireid34: @TrishelleC have u had a poutine from there yet?? Friggin fantastic!!” Yes! Anything with cheese &amp; gravy is amazing
On a yacht last night in Montreal with my man! It's ok to be jealous. http://t.co/pJSSfxXaMg
