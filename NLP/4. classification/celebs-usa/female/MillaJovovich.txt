Anyway,thanks for all your suggestions, but I haven't heard it yet.I wouldn't ordinarily post this song, but this version kind of killed me.
Hey guys! I really appreciate you'r help w with this.It's drake singing the song, not a girl. And in the chorus, everything drops an octave.
It was on soundcloud last year... I'm so stupid for not liking it then... But if anyone remembers that version, I would be so grateful.
Alright, quiz time. Does anyone remember a version of "hotline bling" where the chorus goes DOWN an octave?What artist remixed that version?

i send out a lot of love to my fans and many apologies! all the best! -m
but personal contact with individuals is at an end. its too bad that the rotten apple spoils the bunch, but its the reality.
it makes me feel sad that i have to be distant with you all, as it is not my nature. i have not stopped posting altogether, as was suggested
now that sucks for all the cool people i got to know on here, but my family comes first and i cannot take any chances when it comes to them.
after contacting authorities, i was told to absolutely stop talking to people i don't know on social forums.
A lot of my followers hve been asking why i don't chat on here anymore. unfortunately, my family was threatened last year by a stalker.

@Laces_0ut he was too far away. But what abt the ppl who were right there? It's a tough situation, but clearly he shldn't take the money.
@FameKillz_ going home tonight straight after work!
@eva04product all the CASHhe gets should go to the victims family. No question. The photog shldn't get paid for that!
@FameKillz_ seen it, then he took the data to the police who THEN saw whAt he has taken. Anyway, that money shld go 2 the victims wife.
@FameKillz_ the guy was too far away 2 physically help him. He started setting of his camera so it flashed n maybe the train operator wld
@AMJoesMoustache of course to the family of the VICTIM.
I don't think the photog shld be "vilified", but ALL the proceeds he earns from selling these pics shld go 2 the family of the victim.

@Anthem85 at 300deg. for about 45 minutes.
@Anthem85 arrange yams and pour corn syrup sauce over the top till the yams are swimming. throw some marshmallows on top, cover w foil, bake
@Anthem85 boil the yams till they're halfway cooked. cool. peel of skin. cut in half so they lie flat in the baking dish.
@Anthem85 add a bottle of corn syrup (maybe a bit more according to how many yams you're baking) with a tablespoon of dark molasses.

@fixyouheartswag hi!
@mamagon68 well, as a mom n wife, i'm always trying 2 think of grt ways 2 make things better around the house!
@pardonyou hahahahahaha! those were my cigs of choice back in the day when i smoked...
@doofenshmertz i should have roasted them. that's probably what my mistake was.
@aiinnhhooaa IF we do a 6! lol! its still too soon to tell!
@EduhCelestino great! i'm glad she like them, cause it means they were clear and she understood "the process".
@kidmonster18 lol! u can make it all yourself! i pretty much said the ingredients n if u start prepping the night before, its easy to make!
@AmirUFC as long as there is breath left in us, there is room for improvement!
@marceljerry21 yay!!
@AgustinFerguson LOVE!
@crewpierce oh, i LOVE to cook! you didn't see all the pictures of our family cooking experience?
@MrNecco amen to that. after al that butter, i actually look forward to a cleaner diet. i feel so lazy today!
@garyprc you cld do it for xmas!
fascinating the things i think about sometimes right? lololol! but i can obsess abt cooking 4 hours!
actually the cheddar biscuits rocked, so i think i'm gonna use that recipe n just replace cheese w sweet potato...
anyway, just have to research n cook a bit more to get the recipe just right! i mixed cornbread n sausage in2 my stuffing which was AMAZING!
also, i feel like my sweet potato luck wasn't happening, cause the sweet potato mash didn't turn out as good as i thought it would.
so i can say that thanxgiving dinner was amazing, a few things i need to improve. the sweet potato biscuits could hve had more s.p. puree.
@JoseValbuena_ your bio is pretty aggressive! you sure i shld follow you? lol!
