@tkfuzzkid @NCISNewOrleans I don’t think you’re getting attacked or harassed. You chose to engage in conversation, and now you don’t like it, so you’re playing victim.
@tkfuzzkid @NCISNewOrleans You’re allowed to do whatever you want with regards to the show.  Respectfully, however, that is not simply what you did/said.
You’re my homeboy, A 😘 https://t.co/fptswF17Se
@bigalstone @NCISNewOrleans I don’t understsnd this response.
@tkfuzzkid @NCISNewOrleans And yes. You do have to accept the things that offend you. We all do. You don’t have to practice them. That’s called free will.
@tkfuzzkid @NCISNewOrleans No. You mis-defined bigotry + the person who started this thread didn’t express anything, they demanded censorship based on their beliefs.
Well said @lenadunham and thanks for sharing @ABoneMartinez https://t.co/OfO8dz6pvQ
@tkfuzzkid @klmlarson717 @NCISNewOrleans bigotry [big-uh-tree] noun. stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one's own.

I’m heart broken by Las Vegas. I’m searching for a way to help. I’m tired of the hate, in gunfire and in comments. I’m hoping for change.
@MarkRPellegrino @lenadunham I’m trying to find the ‘reason’ that so many people have so much access to so many guns to kill so many people.
@MarkRPellegrino @lenadunham Hey mark! Good to hear from you. Not what I was I saying, but glad you’re passionate! I’m passionate too...for a safer world!!
@LeadingEasy396 And by arguing when the the “right” time to do that is, is just distracting from the issue that no one wants to address: we need each other
@LeadingEasy396 Confront them all.
@LeadingEasy396 Because people don’t want to be safe. They want to be right. And this is dangerous. Gun control is an issue. Hate is an issue. We have to
@LeadingEasy396 I agree. Murder is a heart issue. But we’ve elected the most hateful leader we’ve ever had. But I’ll be yelled at for bringing that up now.
And we love him ❤️ https://t.co/rsWPd9PdkV

@mrnygiants19 a lot of things aren't right, and we have to say so. we have to keep speaking up. peacefully. together. with strength.
@mrnygiants19 @Emtee_Skull what's interesting is that this 'divide' you see, i see as the greatest coming together i've seen in my lifetime.
@mrnygiants19 @gusferlizi this is not a monarchy, the president doesn't have 'orders' and standing up for what i believe IS what america is
@mrnygiants19 @Emtee_Skull i'm gold you love me but you cannot put me in a box of celebrity.  you have to take me as i am: a human who cares
@mrnygiants19 You having served our country with your life should know that hoping isn't enough...we need action and peaceful resistance.
@mrnygiants19 but heath, we're not 'stuck' with it. Progress needs voices. he may have been inaugurated but he stands for things i protest

You talk so much mitt. And it's so vague. And false.
I won't answer the question, but I will badger you with the same mumbo jumbo for 2+ minutes. -mitt Romney
"yeah....what he said..." - mitt romney.
Binder : school supplies :: mitt Romney : petulant child
Binders of women. Bahahahahahahaha
Romney balanced the Massachusetts budget for 4 years!!?? I'm willing to bet he doesn't even balance his own budget.
"why the president said no to the that pipeline, ill never know"-Romney. Sorry mitt, you can't buy yourself out of climate change. MORON.
It feels good to win. #teambiden
"The choice is clear" ... mitt chose a robot for a running mate.
Paul Ryan can't even answer "what could you bring as a man?"  Maybe he doesn't know what a question is.
For someone who identifies with their religion so much, that was a really hard question for Paul Ryan to answer. #faker
Paul Ryan cares more about getting Obama out of office than the American people. Leader? #VPdebate
"Different than this administration we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements" - Paul Ryan on Opposite Day.
@dprice413 you said nothing new. You debate just like Ryan.
@dprice413 crooks hide their money is Switzerland.
Go Biden go!!!
Watching Paul Ryan make shit up is funnier than Saturday night live.
@SuperLaurenLove my mother is my hero.
“@BarackObama: The choice: http://t.co/nugcHjBv, http://t.co/51ONRRpD” oh mitt. You are so full of fear.
@andymitton yes!!!!
@DanKnightActor thanks! @AETV
"climate change is not a hoax" - president Obama. #DNC @350 it's not red or blue, but a moral issue.
“@BarackObama: President Obama: "As I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America."” we need to support this #vote
@stejenhan2008 president Bartlett 2016!!!
@stejenhan2008 I'd like to say yes but there are people who live in fear. And we all get to vote. I hope they change their minds.
Thank you Bill Clinton...for using specificity... FACTS...details.   If you're on the fence, watch his speech from tonight. #DNC #VOTE
Mitt Romney "more interested in having the job then doing the job" -Mass Gov Deval Patrick #DNC
Oh democratic national convention, way to show what success looks like. #youdontevenhavetoputonyourpants #DNC #vote
