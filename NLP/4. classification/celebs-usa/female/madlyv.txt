@BlameItOnGinger Freemake video conversion so says @narcissusholmes
“@mystifiedLaLa: @madlyv what about the dog whisperer? LOL” He's the only one who should use it.
“@edwardveldhuize: @madlyv ''Careless Whisperer''??????” Nailed it!
The coffee whisperer made eggs and bacon. Breakfast whisperer. #porkwhisperer
@spidermann baby "sitter" would probably be best.
@Beardedvegan you'll have to elaborate.
People need to stop adding "whisperer" after their supposed title.
