Steven Meisel: He's really an artist. He's the guy who can take you to that next level as a model - even to this day.
Patrick Demarchelier: He's a gentleman. He loves Women. He knows how to photograph women.
.@ArthurElgort: He taught me how to have fun, how to move, how to relax.
Irving Penn: Meticulous. He had such integrity. When he said "Don't move" you don't move.
.@herbritts: The purist. Form. Lighting. He made you look the way you wished you looked when you woke up in the morning.
I can get people to look at something, but if the product isn't good, they're not gonna come back. @drsebagh @MeaningfulBty #FashionIcons
#Love #You #Kaia #And #Presley ;) @KaiaGerber @PresleyGerber  https://t.co/ik5mDFTons
On our first date, @randegerber was late picking me up. I was so annoyed, I hate to be late! #FashionIcons
Before @Versace, print models and runway models were separate things...#FashionIcons
.@herbritts asked me to straddle #KDLang for the cover of @VanityFair. That shot really made me realize the power of an image. #FashionIcons
.@taylorswift13 called and asked me to a part of the #BadBloodMusicVideo. My part was to welcome the young girls to the club. #FashionIcons
Richard Gere and I got married in Las Vegas. @herbritts was my bridesmaid. I wore an @armani suit and a ring made of tinfoil. #FashionIcons
I loved working with @herbritts. I only agreed to do @Playboy because he would shoot it. #FashionIcons
When I did my first @voguemagazine with @RichardAvedon, he said have a thought behind your eyes - even if it's just "Buy me! I'm $3.00!"
In my first few months I lived in New York, I slept on @SoniaKashuk's futon. We're still close friends today...#FashionIcons
Victor Skrebneski taught me that clothes have to tell a story. And no one was better at telling a story than @Iman. I learned from her too.
My first paying job was a bra ad. Like, a grandma bra ad. It was plastered all over my high school...But I wasn't embarrassed, I made $150!
I was not discovered in a cornfield! Actually, after meeting *the* town photographer, I got the yellow pages, &amp; started calling agencies.
.@FernMallis: The internet says you were discovered in a cornfield. Is that true? #FashionIcons
@FernMallis Yes and I walked into class my first day and the professor said, "I think you're in the wrong class..." #FashionIcons
.@FernMallis You went to Northwestern University on a full academic scholarship to study chemical engineering. #FashionIcons
As a kid, I wanted to be a nuclear physicist - It was the biggest job I could dream up at the time...#FashionIcons
I was good at school. When I got my first report card, my Dad said he would give me $5 for every A - and that seemed like a good deal to me.
I had some odd jobs - I was a babysitter, I painted houses, I refolded sweaters in a store, and I worked in the cornfields...#FashionIcons
@FernMallis It was the perfect small town upbringing. I think people in the Midwest are generally really kind. I learned how to work hard.
