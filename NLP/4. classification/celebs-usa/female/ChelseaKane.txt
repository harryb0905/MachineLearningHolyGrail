@MicClark72 I think there's a lot of our own personalities showing up in our characters. The writers know us well after 5 seasons!
@laurenfaith1016 Usually Tahj and JL crack each other up the most in scenes. They have to do several takes. It's fun to watch!
@buytheestars Everyone instantly hit it off, but I'd have to say @Tahj_Mowry and I became fast friends. :)
@cravingirwins @Followtheblonde never a dull moment! She's so brilliant! #babydaddychat
Hahaha! I loved that scene where Danny and Bonnie get high together...They improved so much of that! Brilliant! #babydaddychat
