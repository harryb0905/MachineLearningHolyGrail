@Dani1517T Sprinting involves racing 4 heats over about 4 hours, each one at maximum speed for 2-3minutes.  Lactic acid! #EatPositive
@skimaven Something with protein is good for the long events.  Yogurt with your cereal or scrambled eggs are my favorites. #EatPositive
@phiphiherring @KashiFoods I'm an Alaska girl so I love big wild seafood as a good protein source! #EatPositive
@tlrski A little secret, my pre-race ritual is folding my clothes and getting organized to deal with the nervous energy! #EatPositive
@tobymarkowitz Protein before bed helps the body rebuild to be stronger the next day!  The most recovery happens at night! #EatPositive
@Johnnyeinarsen Between sprint heats I usually jog around, drink sports drink, eat a small snack and pump my fav tunes! #EatPositive
@tlrski I love ripping out some pull-ups with 60lbs strapped to my waist!  #EatPositive

@miscraig11 Good carbohydrate sources are really important for me, spread out with good timing throughout the day! #EatPositive
@phiphiherring @KashiFoods Workout buddies are great!  Not all carbs are bad, good wholesome carbs can be great fuel!! #EatPositive
@eric_vinje @KashiFoods I agree Erik, good wholesome ingredients are a must!! #EatPositive
The closer you get to the top, the better your fuel has to be!  This year coming into Sochi was my best preparation yet! #EatPositive

Thanksgiving here in Finland.  Probably won't see any turkey but maybe reindeer?! Thankful to be with my awesome team and ready to race!
