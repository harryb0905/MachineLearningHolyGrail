@pwynn And I did say we should all send up a prayer to God right now, make it more genuine- not the standard line
@pwynn Trust me I did not want to be there add-libbing on the fly when I had just come off another story.  I hate covering mass shootings
@cdunkle1 Just search online and u will see many upset with the thoughts and prayers line.  was repeating what I was seeing since that was my angle
@cdunkle1 Then I added it would sound much more genuine to say right there dear God, let’s send up a prayer right now.
@cdunkle1 Yes- people say that as a routine thing, news anchors too- which is why I refuse to say the standard “thoughts and prayers” line.
@ThePerezHilton @PerezHilton @cocoperez I mentioned this on air and got a lot of hate for it.  That saying is so not genuine
@sherrishavon Thank u I tried to say this on the news and got hate for it!
@IBreatheWonder Thank you!  I tried to say this on air and got hate from it
