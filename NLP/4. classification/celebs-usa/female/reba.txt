Thanks to everyone at @CountryMusic, @BelmontUniv and @ABCNetwork for all your hard work on this year’s #CMAChristmas!
I just love when I get to sing with my piano player, Catherine Marx. She’s so talented. She and I did the album #MyKindOfChristmas. #CMAchristmas
Such a beautiful performance from @lindseystirling! Reminding us of the true meaning of the season. #CMAchristmas https://t.co/uCsJSUGX4P
It’s my buddy @dustinlynch! He’s such a sweetheart! All these guys are looking so sharp tonight on #CMAchristmas!
Love this song @amygrant wrote! #ToBeTogether Such a great message. Check it out on her #TennesseeChristmas album. #CMAchristmas
So I was thinking…@dustinlynch, what if we got together and made a new Christmas classic...It’s A Wonderful Elf? #CMAchristmas https://t.co/sqAedVeyfp
Update on the reindeer corndog situation: don’t have any raisins for the eyes. @martinamcbride, you’re the expert chef - help!!! #CMAchristmas
I just love singing with my friends @IsaacsMusic! Their harmonies always make me cry! We recorded “What Child Is This” as a bonus track on #MyKindOfChristmas this year. You can listen to it now wherever you stream music or pick up a CD at Walmart. #CMAchristmas https://t.co/WN1HDdceBq
“Away In A Manger” was the first song I ever sang in public. It will always hold a special place in my heart and I loved hearing @BradPaisley sing it. #CMAchristmas
Hey @bretteldredge, does corn pudding taste like corndogs? Because if it does, I might need to get that recipe. #CMAchristmas
I just can’t get over how creative and talented @LindseyStirling is! If I tried to dance and play the violin like that...wait, no...I’m not trying that. #CMAchristmas
Commercial/corndog time. Since I guess no one is bringing me a corndog, I’ll have to make my own. Look at these Rudolph the Red Nose Corndogs I found!!! #CMAchristmas https://t.co/Gn3gKu9Ny5
Does it get any better than @DanAndShay??? Those boys can sing! #CMAchristmas
“Mary Did You Know” is one of my all-time favorite Christmas songs. So glad @brettyoungmusic chose to sing it this year! #CMAchristmas
I’m so proud of @OldDominion and all their success this past year. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of guys! #CMAchristmas
Commercial break time again...I’m still waiting on my corndog. #CMAchristmas
I’m pretty sure there’s a law out there that says it’s not officially Christmas until @michaelwsmith and @amygrant sing! So thrilled they were able to be with us this year. #CMAchristmas https://t.co/DyKY1KuILw
It just doesn’t get any more classy than @itstonybennett and @DianaKrall! It was such a thrill to have them on the show. Tony and I worked together in London many many years ago and it was great to see him again. #CMAchristmas https://t.co/R3KnwfwRvc
It’s beginning to look (and sound) a lot like Christmas with @martinamcbride! #CMAchristmas https://t.co/lroGMPrS02
Time for a wardrobe change! You can’t ever have too much fringe! #CMAchristmas https://t.co/N4tIAIiZZr
