Thanks to the sympathetic @united gate agent next door who appreciated what was needed and went above and beyond.  Rare to see these days  ;-)
My dad filled them in - that his @united flight was 35 min late arriving from SFO into DEN, and this was the last flight to COS.  The UA gate agent from the flight next door was sympathetic,  called the pilot/flight attendants, and they opened the door and allowed him to board...
Well, the end result worked out okay @united  -  my dad ran down the B concourse...the gate agent wasn't there when he arrived @ gate, the door was already closed.  He knocked several times;  the @united gate agent from the next gate asked if they could help...... https://t.co/ZQBrU72UQC
