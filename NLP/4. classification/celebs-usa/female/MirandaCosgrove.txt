@iTunes Bob has my ❤️ because he carries around a teddy bear and has two different colored eyes. Also his body is pretty cute 😂 thanks for all the questions! #DespicableMe3
@cindyxchen That is so nice! You made my day! Thanks for the kind messages!
@Ericsso_n Wonder and Lady Bird!
@MirandaC_lovers Yes, definitely! 😃
@camillee137 Being with my family and my dog, Penelope. 🐶👩🏻👱🏻‍♂️
@iTunes I do believe in love at first sight! Also I loved Niko’s character and his little cheese offering 🧀 even though Margo isn’t as into it lol
@McCurdian_Kress Yes! I love college! 😄
@shwnrevival So excited!! It’s my favorite holiday!
@FerCosgrover01 Love you too! 😘
@iTunes @SteveCarell He can do the Gru voice at the drop of a hat and always does it when people ask 😂 He’s the best
@chibisteven The last movie I saw was Wonder! I loved it
@psychopatd 🧐 Probably that one because I like that it is investigating something hahaa
@McCurdian_Kress My best friends goddaughter 😎
@ghostlwurry This Is Us! 😘
@CosgroverUnited @iTunes I think I’m similar to Margo because we both are tough and we stand up for what we believe in 😋 Also we both have brown hair and I love her fashion sense lol
@dxnielghost Thanks for always being so nice!
@iTunes It’s really cool to be able to go to work in sweats and tennis shoes! It’s different than live action because you don’t have to worry about messing up your lines hahaa you get an endless amount of takes 😃
@Miranda_mybaby I love Bad at Love by @halsey How about you??
@melaniemorettis Thanks for being so sweet! 🙃
@tflashoblack @iTunes Intelligent and kind 😘
@iTunes 😎😁🧐😏😘😋
@cindyxchen @iTunes @CarlyMarieC It’s really easy to balance voice acting and school because I just fit it in whenever I don’t have class! 😄Thanks for the message! Can’t wait to see her too!
@lightsmiranda Thanks for the support! You are so amazing!
@Fangirl4bands @iTunes Thanks for the question! My favorite line from the movie is when the minions say “whaaaaaaat?!” and in the first Despicable Me I liked Agnes’s line “it’s so fluffy!!”
@httpscosgrover @iTunes Haha! I’m working on it! 😄
@iTunes Yeah! I started the first #DespicableMe when I was 13 and now I’m 24! Margo is a really fun character to play and it has definitely helped during the recording process that I’ve played her for a long time!
I’m chatting with @iTunes right now! Head over and follow along! 😁
Can’t wait to see you guys! @BuildseriesNYC https://t.co/3EelYRxxU7
