@officedepot someone owes me $139.00.  If I bought Microsoft office from Office Depot &amp; installed it on new computer I returned.  Who owes?
@Office This has taken HOURS of my time!!!!  YOU owe ME $139.  I won't be purchasing Microsoft or ANYTHING from OFFICE DEPOT AGAIN!!!
@Office You are referring me to Microsoft AGAIN!!!!  They said YOU need to give me the refund!!!  I paid OFFICE DEPOT for it!!!
@Office Microsoft says Office Depot owes me the refund because I bought it at your store &amp; it is loaded on the computer I returned to y'all.
@Office depot told me Microsoft needs to give me a refund.  They said since I purchased it thru You, y'all needed to refund me???
@Office the version of micro office......that is on one computer &amp; cost $139.99 from your store.  It's installed on the computer I returned.
@Office I purchased Microsoft office and the most current windows is on my computer.
@office depot your store manager doesn't even understand products in your store. You now have the computer with Microsoft office I paid for!
@office depot I only purchased install for 1 computer.  The manager gave me wrong info, was snappy, and I'm stuck with Nothing &amp; no refund.
@Microsoft said @office depot should refund.  The manager at Office Depot said I could use micro soft office on all computers now....???
@officedepot I installed @microsoft office that I also purchased.  Office Depot referred me to Microsoft to refund. I got the run around.
@officedepot I purchased a computer at the Las Vegas Tropicana/Apache store.  It was such BAD QUALITY, I returned it.

@DogShitFrosting We've all done embarrassing things. I'm thankful videos weren't around when I was a young. I'd be the most famous Brunson!
@DogShitFrosting Todd's not perfect.  Nor am I or you.  It's RUDE to put him down to HIS FATHER in PUBLIC!!!  Seriously, THINK about it.
@DenverDaveH I just think it's rude to put someone down that you don't even know.  ESPECIALLY TO HIS FATHER!!!
SERIOUSLY ANNOYED at comments about Todd &amp; poker HOF.  People that judge a poker player by what they see on TV &amp; tourneys ONLY have NO CLUE.
@DogShitFrosting Imagine how proud your daughters will be of you, looking at your twitterfeed &amp; seeing what their "DAD" writes! #NOT
@WASHDUDE @AnjelaBrunson That is awesome Darren!!!  Have fun and good luck!!! :)
@iloveriverlover Perhaps you should focus on improving yourself so you don't  feel the need to attempt to put down others???
I'm blown away by HOW RUDE people can be when talking about POKER PLAYERS...like it's okay to say  MEAN SHIT &amp; be downright NASTY. #GETALIFE

@lasvegaspokers @CardPlayerCruis I think we should get a huge group together and go sometime.  It would be a blast!!!
Happy Sunday Y'all. I'm so jealous of those playin the SCOOPS all day.  Remember how fun online poker used to be?  #thosewerethedays
@AnnieLePage You're "juggling time" could be called having balance for some good things in life. Many poker players only make time for poker
@ToddBrunson @AnjelaBrunson a Russian Honey Boo Boo in the Circus???
I've never watched Honey Boo Boo but have a feelin @ToddBrunson wants  his daughter to turn out like her unless @AnjelaBrunson gets a say.
@ToddBrunson aren you watchin Honey Boo Boo?  You must be lonely in Montana.  Get back to Vegas QUICK!!!
@TexDolly @Doc_Sands also has a little white dog he LOVES.  Y'all do have quite a bit in common!
@TexDolly Thanks Dad &amp; THANKS SO MUCH 4 puttin up w/ me &amp; the kitty situation, HELPING &amp; comin to the RESCUE!  Your the BEST!  I love you ♥
@ggr1868 He ate 4 plates of food, drank bowl of water &amp; appears to be fine.  Not sure I should of let him eat it all.  Thanks 4 caring.  :)
@ggr1868 on way, Dad paid a gardener a100 bucks to climb on roof &amp; scare "Scaredy Cat" down.  I was afraid he got hurt but all okay....
@ggr1868  After security, animal control, humane society, neighbors, 311 &amp; trip to Lowes for plank arcross ladder &amp; roof failed, my roofer
Scaredy Cat safe, full &amp; hydrated.  No serious injuries.  GREAT Birthday present for me.  Thanks y'all for your encouragement &amp; support!
Oh.....THANKS Y'ALL for the BIRTHDAY WISHES!!!  :)  I really appreciate them!!!
Didn't work. Wish I would of thought of using a trap.  I even have one in the garage.  PLEASE PRAY Scaredy Cat's okay.(yes, that's his name)
I called agencies, 311, neighbors, security.  MUGH.  I went to get plank from Lowes &amp; Dad and I rigged a walkway w/ ladder last night.
Trying to make sure he didn't get hurt jumping. My roofer was going to come by to help. GOD BLESS HIM. I'm surprised most people didn't care
Thanks for all the kind responses and concerns!!!!!  He's off the roof.  Dad got a gardener to chase him.  He jumped far....can't find him.
1st time on the internet since tryin to get the cat off neighbors roof.  Feral cat stuck 3+ days &amp; I was afraid it was gonna die.  CRAZY!!!
@MarieLizette @Lance_Bradley @olegsmith HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my BIRTHDAY MATES!!!  I hope WE ALL have the BEST BIRTHDAY YET!!!

@SavagePoker I'm more into Facebook than Twitter.  I do the "likes" but not the "pokes"  maybe that's why I'm still single.  :)
I just read:  "Right-handed people live, on average, 9 years longer than left-handed people".  NOT GOOD NEWS cause I'm a LEFTY!
@EricMizrachi Good Question Eric.  Gotta think about that one...and check out the responses.  :)
@JeffMadsenobv GO JEFF GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

@CrazyJulius22 I left before it was over but I think it was a 4 way split and Todd came in 5th.
@CrazyJulius22 @AnjelaBrunson @ToddBrunson It was so fun Julius!  I sure wish you'd come next year.  We could get a group for outdoor fun!
@stein_cooper I can assure you THAT NEVER HAPPENED!  I imagine if I open that....I'm gonna get a virus in my computer.  THANKS!
I'm home from Montana....  Had a great time!  Hung out at Todd's tourney but didn't play.  Had too many things to do.  It's HOT in VEGAS!
@EMoutinho I ♥ Laguna Beach!  I lived in Dana Point for 11 yrs.  A friend got married in a park overlookin the ocean in Laguna. Beautiful!

@Nick_C_C Good Luck to you in the seniors event.  Luckily, I have a few more fews til I can play that one!  :)
@Nick_C_C I'm not saying Esther doesn't deserve to be nominated.  I'm not aware of her accomplishments.  @KarinaJett lives &amp; breathes poker.
@Nick_C_C @KarinaJett has done alot for poker &amp; poker charity events, teaching, etc.  She CONSTANTLY represents poker in a positive light.
@Vanbcsean Not sure what events I'm playing.  I'm busy with a project and a bit rusty on poker.  Just playing it by ear.....

How is it possible my dad @TexDolly has under 400k followers & Kim Kardashian has over 11 million.  I guess poker isn't as big as we think!
Retweets are a pain. Twitter should have a feature to change fonts & colors...would make it soooo much better & easier to tell what is what!

@helloross You are so precious!!!
Sometimes I think I should join the crowd....if everyone is doing it.  But as soon as I do & get used to it, they'll prohibit it!
I don't think covering your face or wearing sunglasses should be allowed in poker.
I don't think it should be allowed to cover up your face with a hoodie in poker...
@SteveHennessy of course he does! @TexDolly. Follow him.  He's quite amusing at times!
@Doc_Sands You did GREAT!  You & Erika handled yourselves with class & played awesome.  She is adorable!
@SteveHennessy I'm his daughter.

@TecmoSB I wasn't just referring to you.  It's been going on awhile.  2 + 2 threads...jungleboy & various young players. I don't like it. :(
@TecmoSB Young people are calling my Dad names for expressing his opinion....& disrespecting him.  That is what I have a problem with.
I think it's funny how Dad @TexDolly blocks people.  Young people now days need to have respect for their elders!
@AnjelaBrunson Not playing today.  I'm planning on playing the Ladies tourney at the Venetian tomorrow at 3pm......join me!!!!
