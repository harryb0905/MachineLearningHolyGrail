My take on the @FoxNews #Kavanaugh interview. How #Judiciary - and Kavanaugh- can do better on Thursday. Via @TheAtlantic  What do you think?  #SCOTUS #KavanaughHearings #Senate #Senate https://t.co/cexFGFE6iV
Gang rape often involves witnesses and enablers who don’t participate in the sexual act. Virgins included. (The allegation is “targeting” women.)  In his answer Kavanaugh also invoked his religion, service and scholarship. Also not relevant. https://t.co/MlOZ6jWR13

5. I also think that fast-twitch, incremental, palace intrigue journalism enabled a Trump victory. But I’ll save that for another day. 6/
4. That means what @BuzzFeedBen calls insider political journalism turns off half the news audience. So it’s bad for democracy. And it's bad business. 5/
3. Theory of the case:  It isn’t that female news consumer don’t care about politics. Opposite. They really care. But they can’t stand the trivialization, gamification, and the impersonal nature of the coverage. 4/
2. Female news viewers report the same level of interest in politics. But they consume less of it than men. They prefer topics like education, health and human interest.  (Source: Media Insights Project @AMPress) 3/
1. Fast-twitch, access focused, palace-intrigue reporting isn’t just inadequate to our moment. It’s also bad business. It turns off a massive part of the news audience. Women.

Also, because this is already ridiculously long, I’ll make it longer by saying a thank you to @RonanFarrow and @NewYorker. They used access to the VVVIP rooms to expose wrongdoing at the pinnacle of power.  That’s rare. END 13/
I think that we need to build new, independent news sources with leadership that is diverse from day one. It will create a different culture at work, and bring more people’s experiences into the news.  12/
Personally I don’t believe the established media institutions will change. They’ll get rid of the worst actors and make cosmetic adjustments. 11/
Across the news industry many women are working in similar environments. Many news organizations are aggressively covering wrongdoing in other industries while keeping their own secret. 10/
This is the killer quote from the story. “A lot of my memories of ‘60 Minutes’ are of other women coming into my office, closing the door, and just breaking down because of working as a woman at CBS..." 9/
The accounts are devastating and the denials are just gross. Jeff Fager is actually quoted saying that one of the women has “an axe to grind.” Seriously? Imagine what he'd do with that if an interview subject said it on 60 Mins.8/
Too many news leaders have been hiding their own dirty laundry while reporting on everyone else’s. 7/
I’m most interested in the bit at the end of the piece. The part about CBS News, 60 Minutes and Jeff Fager. It speaks to a moral corruption inside old media institutions. 6/
It causes you to call everything into question. Your work. The limits of your own courage. It impacts your news judgment. It changes the way you see the world.  That impacts how you frame the news. 5/
So when you get harassed or watch it happen to your friends and those same managers silence you, make you pretend it didn’t happen, and enable the harassers it is disillusioning, stifling. Not just personally but professionally too. 4/
There’s a unique awfulness to experiencing and witnessing workplace harassment as a journalist. You go into the field to get to the truth. You see your news managers tell the public that they’re dedicated to exposing abuse, holding power to account. 3/
What Ronan describes is a kind of moral corruption that exists at the highest levels of many newsrooms. I’ve seen it up close. 2/
The @RonanFarrow @NewYorker piece is cathartic. It speaks to the integrity of the people who decide what counts as news. Not just at CBS. 1/
Male reporters shout questions everyday. But @kaitlancollins is “inappropriate”?   Can only imagine how Bill Shine defines appropriate female behavior. https://t.co/NTf0YJ9tJU
Instead of raging at @marcorubio  here’s an idea: listen and learn. He’s giving media + opposition insight.  Instead of obsessing over Trump’s personality and outrageous behavior — always reframe the discussion to his policies and their impact on regular Americans. https://t.co/62CeXGrZCI
My larger point — there’s a lot of hysteria. In reaction to this + everything Trump does. #SCOTUS retirement creates a new set of options. Ignoring them serves no one (except the media brands that believe panic = profits.) Another way:  give viewers perspective. https://t.co/39dX3W0Bi0
If dems can’t find a GOP to come over and block Trump’s SCOTUS pick AND they fail to use SCOTUS to drive turnout/wave....One has to ask if they are a functioning/relevant party.   SCOTUS is an energizing issue for voters. https://t.co/Ik06dUnKW2
It is early to rule out the possibility of a GOP Senator joining with Dems.  Women’s rights. Immigration. There are GOPs who care about these issues. The margin is close enough this could be their moment to take a stand. https://t.co/tNcYcU6olI
They find @JeffFlake or another GOP who wants to take a stand. https://t.co/QY1nwn7RbJ
Dems will be tested. They can now 1. filibuster #Trump #SCOTUS pick and 2. use #Kennedy SCOTUS as an issue to drive midterms turnout, and try to flip both houses.  Instead of panicking, this can be seen as an opportunity for the opposition. https://t.co/VuS13j6hAK

Our ultimate job is not just to be liberated, not simply to celebrate our people’s freedom, but to become the liberator of slaves and the tireless defender and protector of those who suffer fromspiritual and physical hunger.  - Elianna Yolkut @rabbielianna
We have no choice but to start the seder with a focus on the needs of others, for what other purpose is our freedom but to reach out to those suffering, those who are not free? The journey through the seder night begins with words to implore us not to leave others to suffer.5/
Thus, the focus of hunger and need at the start of our seder reminds us from the outset that our work is not done. As free Jews we have an obligation to continue the work of Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) 4/
one aspect of our liberation still remains elusive: we are still distant from the ultimate redemption. Too many go to bed hungry, too many still die of illnesses for which there are cures, and too many suffer the deadening blows of bigotry and prejudice 3/
Let all who are hungry come and eat, let all in need come and partake of our Pesach celebration.”  This is one of the first phrases recited at Passover seders. What is this line about hunger, about doing at the opening of one of the most important nights in our ritual calendar?2/
This is first day of Passover, holiday recalling the Jewish people’s freedom from slavery. It’s also a reminder of our obligation to fight on behalf of the oppressed today. Here is a great expression of Passover’s meaning from @RabbiElianna 1/

@RachelAbramsNY @jimrutenberg 4/ - Was there an outside safe party to whom those who fear retaliation could take complaints? - Did the company have a history of disciplining harassers or silencing the accusers? - What % of senior leadership at the company was female?
3/ Questions to consider when reporting on bosses who say that they "didn’t know” @RachelAbramsNY @jimrutenberg - Was there someone to complain to? - Did that person report to a manager invested in the alleged harasser’s enduring success?
Amazing....the Big Sort. We're sorting ourselves into like-minded communities. And people can read your politics by the cars on your street! https://t.co/oAP7MvqPof
2/ Creating a workplace in which women feel they can't report harassment isn't exonerating. Social science (and my opinion) suggests it’s a failure of leadership. See: https://t.co/97zao9CaCV  https://t.co/pfOL55RBfd https://t.co/dG8e7NrMGR
1/  Missing the point. This speaks to a problem with the culture and leadership of the workplace.  “There was never a complaint about Matt,” Jeff Zucker said. “There was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant or predatory behavior.”https://t.co/vnAf0l3xlM #MattLauer
I hear ya. It’s not about the bad apple.  It’s about the bad barrel. And the bad barrel makers. https://t.co/SdIlrtm3sJ
7/ No surprise here. The same study finds that for women who report harassment "concerns regarding retaliation appear to be warranted. Women who filed a formal complaint, compared to women who did not, reported more negative treatment at work as a result." https://t.co/GRKeC89zjH
6/ This study has a ton of good info: "Sexual harassment affects the organization because targeted employees report decreased performance + organizational commitment, as well as increased withdrawal, turnover, + team conflict..." https://t.co/FDFv7NwAxo https://t.co/LiOdInvk0Q
It's a little more nuanced. Putting one or two women in leadership doesn't work. Research shows-- when 30% of the roles are filled by women, the culture shifts. It's about changing the culture. See, for example, https://t.co/FDFv7NwAxo and #BroadInfluence by @JNSmall https://t.co/9j6DQkUBZb
5/ "The key feature that distinguishes harass-ing from non-harassing conduct is the fact that it is unwelcome, not reciprocated, and considered inappropriate according to shared societal standards." From Sexual harassment: Motivations and consequences https://t.co/1MQfQtJHjg https://t.co/H82l4cSzvt
4/ Third, cracking down on harassers reduces overall harassment. That is, showing  that the behavior won't be tolerated by any, reduces harassment by others. It means the tone is set at the top. Leadership. https://t.co/8Tp7ykFowJ
3/ Second, very hierarchical workplaces are more prone to harassment. One remedy -- establishing an external body to which emloyees can report harassment and/or anonymous reporting mechanisms. https://t.co/QZr1N4p868
2/ First, put more women in senior leadership. Research shows women  (in real #s) are more likely to recognize harassment, less likely to support normalizing "locker room" culture. https://t.co/mZO9whQ5YK

It's not a comment on men w/o daughters. In some swing states Dems are targeting undecided college men w/ daughters. My point: This helps. https://t.co/woSz6vDdzd
No. But Dems are targeting white college undecideds. Honing in- they consider white college men with daughters key/gettable. https://t.co/QTD8aaaWSo

@ConserveTruth13 why not ask ppl to read whole convo in context? I asked a Q, then flagged most common answers.
And this feeds more debate (dissension) in Obama vs Clinton era RT @olafbockholt No twitter. No facebook. No (total) deadlock in politics.
Other big view why more debate now than '98 RT@johnmoz "We found WMD" skepticism; experience getting bogged down in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan.
Lots of ppl share this view re why wasn't there sim debate before '98 afghan strike RT@stephenfhayes US embassies hit, Americans killed
Why more public debate now than Clinton '98 strike. Public demands more transparency? '98 was response to attack at US? US wary-post Iraq?
When Clinton ordered '98 afghan strike, wasn't similar public debate in advance. Why now?
