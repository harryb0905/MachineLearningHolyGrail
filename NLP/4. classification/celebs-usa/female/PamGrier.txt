Digital Foxes out there, Canvass as many hearts and souls to vote.  At least give those lost your attention. Listen to them.  There may be answers in your questions.  Peace, Pam.🤸🏽‍♂️🙏🏽
@ARRAYNow @LegalSojourner @ava I look forward to seeing it.
Visit a resident family member at a nursing home or assisted living, physically unable to vote.  Ask the hard questions on financial realities and care. I’m getting first hand reality on  why to vote blue to keep Social Security and social services in place.
Don’t wait for the call from a grand mother’s nursing home that she was being kicked out for lack of Social Security, Medicare and Medicad support. Vote to keep a security net for your family’s future.
Millennials and younger generations will place their grandparents in grave financial peril if they don’t vote. Churches, nursing homes and care givers will lose greatly.  Jobs will be lost.  Reach out before it’s too late.
Pastors should be concerned about tithing if Social Security benefits are dismantled. Mom and her Senior peers will be unable to give to their churches. That’s all they are talking about. Their Medicad and Medicare is in jeopardy if we do not vote.  The collapse of our churches.
Brown  https://t.co/XlaK6c6nyA app is all mom wants to see. The news has us so heart broken.  More folks drop by to see her and view Brown Sugar.  More popcorn, please.  Brown https://t.co/XlaK6c6nyA, it’s like Netflix only blacker.  💃🏽🤸🏿‍♂️

Oprah’s stirring acceptance speech at the Golden Globes will be framed and placed in my office. When I arrived at her home for her gathering  of notable women, she and Gail graciously showed me framed historic documents.  The power of words.
@orinocoflobee @AndyHortin Not verified her claims.
Golden Globes Last night: male winners did not raise issue of support with Times Up?  Did I miss something?
Golden Oprah tonight.

@KellyKittyKat Eddie was a dear friend and we did not date.  We shared secrets, went to a movie and laughed.  I played his mom in film Pluto Nash. He was always kind, a gentleman and brilliant.
I rescued a lost paint horse during Christmas dinner. Didn’t want her to spook, run through neighbor’s rusty wire fencing in the dark as my horses were concerned. She followed me into the pen and I prepped a bed and plenty of hay and water. Located her owners the next day. 🙏🏽
