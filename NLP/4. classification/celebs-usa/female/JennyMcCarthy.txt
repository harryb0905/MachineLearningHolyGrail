@azchef76 I’m totally making this shit up. Lol
RT if you’re watching @MaskedSingerFOX right now! #maskedsinger
@ehorlacher @MaskedSingerFOX A couple reasons.  1. Because I’m way too lazy to do my make up everyday for radio. Majority don’t even see me.  2. The lights they have pointed at my face for 2 hours makes it hard to see the commercials I have to read. Much easier on my eyeballs to wear shades.
It’s almost that time! @MaskedSingerFOX  will you live tweet with me? #maskedsinger https://t.co/9gQ3RLAsdf

@lrd36old old spice, of course. 😜
@angiejoh75 you always have the best ones
@Pynkee @ThePerezHilton Michele you stated that I taunted my followers to make fun of her. I can’t control what people think or how they perceive things. Obviously you projected your own negativity and that’s fine. But don’t lie and say I made my followers do something.
@ThePerezHilton thanks 😎❤️
@Pynkee @ThePerezHilton and where did I say “go taunt her?”  Don’t project your negativity and then make up a lie.
@ThePerezHilton @Pynkee I said no such thing.
@Ddub_Heartgold oh no. I just fell in love.
@ladyturtlemoon oh no. I’m so so sorry.
