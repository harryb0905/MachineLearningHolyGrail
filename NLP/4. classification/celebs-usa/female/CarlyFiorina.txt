He changed the order of things for the better - for all of us. 3/3 #MLKDay
He was not dissuaded by criticism, he never wavered in the courage of his convictions, he collaborated with all who would stand by his side, and he saw possibilities in the people and the world around him - no matter how ugly those people and that world looked.  2/3 #MLKDay
We remember Dr. King for the power of his oratory, the depth of his love, the strength of his character. He was an extraordinary leader who inspires us all. 1/3 #MLKDay

We can and must do better. Read about our work to do just that in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/Equieqobtf
Read my conversation with the @dcexaminer at last week’s https://t.co/zSAirYAWS8 event with leaders representing veterans, homelessness and housing groups in Washington, D.C.  https://t.co/EquieqFMRP
I see role models and leaders all around. They aren’t famous. They don’t get to talk on TV. And yet, they change the order of things for the better.  More from my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/pBxLoyewqv
We need to look in the mirror at the citizen staring back at us. We need to raise our expectations of those who want to represent us, and we ourselves need to model the behavior we expect of our representatives.  Read more from my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/pBxLoxWV1V
As you consider your candidates this November, ask yourself whether they are worthy of working for you, or if they simply bring more personality, rhetoric, outrage, and insult to the table.  Read my @dcexaminer op-ed: https://t.co/pBxLoxWV1V
If we want our representatives to actually make progress on the issues that matter most to us, we also need to assess whether a candidate can truly lead.   Read more from my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/pBxLoyewqv
5 questions to ask yourself before you vote this November.   Read my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/pBxLoxWV1V
As we approach this midterm election, we should think less about our “team,” and more about the qualities we need in each person running — and whether those individuals are truly worthy of a position of leadership.   Read my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/pBxLoxWV1V

Sandra Day O’Connor is more than a trailblazer, more than a member of the highest court in the land; she is a role model for all of us.   Frank and I are praying for her and her family during this time, and we ask that you join us.  (3/3) https://t.co/3PnAznlvhb
As the first woman on the Supreme Court, she made her formidable presence felt not by attacking those with whom she disagreed, but by attracting those with whom, by strength of reasoning and conviction, she could find common ground.   (2/3) https://t.co/3PnAznlvhb
Never flashy or angry, always gracious and dignified, Sandra Day O’Connor has nevertheless smashed barriers, challenged stereotypes and upended the status quo all throughout her life.   (1/3) https://t.co/3PnAznlvhb
If we can maintain focus on our citizen responsibility to solve the problems we deal with every day, there is nothing out of our reach. So, what, or who, are we waiting for?  Read my new op-ed in the @dcexaminer:  https://t.co/EwoZhm6Af8
It’s time we stop looking up or far away and start looking within ourselves for the capacity each of us have. We should look around us for the capacity our fellow citizens have and collaborate with them.  Read about how in my new op-ed in the @dcexaminer:  https://t.co/EwoZhmobDI
We need to remember who we are. We need to remember that each of us has enormous potential. We have the potential to solve problems, which is to say, to lead.  More from my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/EwoZhm6Af8
Alexis de Tocqueville noted, “The health of a democratic society may be measured by the quality of functions performed by private citizens.” People closest to the problems know best how to solve them.  Read my op-ed in the @dcexaminer: https://t.co/EwoZhmobDI
Our nation is unique and exceptional because, unlike every other nation on earth, we were founded on ideas – three powerful ideas.   Read about them in my new op-ed in the @dcexaminer:  https://t.co/EwoZhm6Af8
We have strayed very far from our founding ideas. Instead of recognizing that each of us has inherent value and potential, we routinely define people based on their circumstances, their appearance, or even their beliefs.  https://t.co/EwoZhm6Af8
Americans are rightly frustrated by festering problems that don’t seem to get better and wonder who is going to solve them? To paraphrase Shakespeare, the solutions lie “not in our stars, but in ourselves.” https://t.co/EwoZhm6Af8

Does his language perpetuate and exacerbate long-standing problems? Indeed. While this is true, the rest of us have plenty of work to do that can make a real difference. And that work will have a bigger impact over time than the president’s Twitter feed.   https://t.co/aNXeovGVtu
Why should we care? Because when we diminish, disrespect or underutilize talent and brainpower based on someone’s “appearance” or “style,” we get below-average results.  Read more from my op-ed in the @WashingtonPost: https://t.co/aNXeovYwl2 @PostOpinions
Women reading this will nod knowingly, perhaps with a tinge of resignation or even despair.    Men reading this may throw up their hands and say, “I’m tired of talking about this and tired of being the bad guy.”   Read my @WashingtonPost op-ed:  https://t.co/aNXeovYwl2
The most dramatic stories — just like the most salacious words — sometimes distract us from another long-standing reality. Among Fortune 500 chief executives, there are fewer women than men... named James.   Read more from my op-ed in the @WashingtonPost:  https://t.co/aNXeovGVtu
Teams discover that to accomplish more and perform at a higher level, they need to include others around the table. When people learn diversity is in their self-interest, not just the morally right thing to do, behavior changes and real inclusion begins.  https://t.co/aNXeovGVtu
We won’t change things substantively unless we change our mind-set. When talent is squandered, when human potential is crushed, when someone’s spirit is broken, we all lose.  Read my op-ed in the @washingtonpost: https://t.co/aNXeovGVtu

The most dramatic stories — just like the most salacious words — sometimes distract us from another long-standing reality. Women and people of color are treated differently simply because we are different.   My op-ed in the @washingtonpost: https://t.co/aNXeovYwl2
When Donald Trump made disparaging comments about my appearance, many were shocked. I was not. He was not the first man, nor will he be the last, to comment on my appearance in an attempt to diminish or distract from my ability to contribute and lead.   https://t.co/aNXeovGVtu

We get confused about what leadership is today. We’re led to believe that it’s about position, title or power. It isn’t. Leadership is about problem solving. Go to my new website to see how all of us can lift up leaders everywhere: https://t.co/W6bTQFSKWJ

That imbalance changes everything - even in so-called consensual relationships. Sexual misconduct is always an abuse of power - whether in business, politics, athletics or religion.   Your statement is a petty, political denial that helps no one. You should’ve known better.
Really, @HillaryClinton?   Do you really think your husband (then-President of the United States) and Monica Lewinsky (a then-22-year-old intern) were peers?   Sexual misconduct is about power: specifically the enormous imbalance of power between perpetrator and victim.  1/2 https://t.co/Q6prDflJJf

Resilience is vital to leadership. When we face a challenge, it is our responsibility to ourselves and our neighbors to turn it in to an opportunity to lead. I've found in my life that after daunting challenges, we become better leaders. #ChallengedToLead https://t.co/K3Lgd9NmyP
In every challenge, there's a blessing. Those who've experienced hardship often become true leaders. Charles Collier looked at his diagnosis and found an opportunity to lead. May we accept those challenges when we face them in our lives. #ChallengedToLead https://t.co/4dT24JBZM3
I’ll be joining @TeamCavuto on @FoxNews shortly to talk about my friend, @SenJohnMcCain. I hope you’ll join us.
You see, courage and character are inextricably linked. They are the vital traits of an effective and positive leader. That was John McCain. A man of principle, a man of character, and a man who put his country above all else.   My op-ed in The Hill: https://t.co/lmQhHI9NY4
While we honor him this week, I'd take the privilege to speak for my friend in saying that a greater honor would be that, after a worthy sendoff, we return to our work, debates and communities with a renewed focus on service &amp; the greater good.

John McCain was #ChallengedToLead in a manner few have experienced. He passed the test and applied the lessons of resilience he learned in such dire conditions to his life of service.  https://t.co/The1NFRqh3

I am fortunate to know many veterans who lead in the ways outlined in this report. They demonstrate leadership by engaging with their local communities, stepping up and out to address problems that they see close to home.  https://t.co/SrhtQo2f5R
Charlottesville's @NikuyahWalkerCC saw not just the rally last August, but long term problems. She knew change requires showing up every day – not just when everyone is watching.

An example of the good we do when we see problems in our communities &amp; work tirelessly to take them on.   We don’t have to agree on everything to agree we care &amp; to work to address problems https://t.co/EP2B1ir7Ko
Great to see @IndraNooyi taking on an important challenge:   "… she plans to help develop more talent to ensure that women are represented in the top ranks of corporate America.”  https://t.co/txVUgSA2Ea
If we want to solve the problems around us, we need people who see the world differently than we do.   We need to prioritize that at every step of the problem-solving process, including who we invite in and how we collaborate with one another. https://t.co/WQhgjvy8Ev (2/2)
Diversity isn't just a nice to do - it's necessary for effective problem-solving.   The nonprofit leaders highlighted in this report get this and they understand that it can be hard. We all gravitate toward people like us - who think like us and share the same experiences. (1/2)
I’m proud to have a team made up of mostly millennials. It is important for organizations to learn how to attract the next generation of top talent.   Read this Forbes article, which features Unlocking Potential CEO, Casey Enders: https://t.co/xY41pGfgnt
Power concentrated is power abused. We need leaders "devoted to redistributing power downward.” We must show our political parties &amp; leaders that they're not owed our loyalty. Citizens are sovereign &amp; possess enormous potential. Our loyalty must be earned. https://t.co/ledGyAiFjw
Read more from my June op-ed in USA Today: https://t.co/2mbXIMredv
There are good individuals in politics, but the political system they are a part of, driven by the two major parties, values winning above all else.   Leadership and problem solving require looking to the future and remembering who politicians are elected to serve.
Our popular culture of instant gratification, 15 minutes of fame, and self-indulgence reinforces so many practices that undermine problem solving and leadership. Leadership requires that we focus on what is important.   Read more from January: https://t.co/3zhQniSYsp
Earlier this week, I posted about our culture's obsession with salacious political gossip rather than the Syrian crisis. It is important that we start to build a culture that lifts up true leadership.  See more here: https://t.co/P3NnzyhuQn
Our culture – reflected by the behaviors we reward and pay attention to – has been out of whack for a while, but there is no clearer example than the willful ignorance our institutions have displayed toward the massacre in Syria.  Read my full post: https://t.co/pInpWft6C6
A reminder of what we must stand for in America, and who we must be. It's another example of leadership against a massive status quo. It serves as a reminder that we, as Americans, must always advocate for, protect, and defend liberty and justice for all. https://t.co/jMDMtlRMIx

This morning around 10:30 a.m. I’ll be joining @THEHermanCain live on the air. Listen in here. http://t.co/9YhGeGe7FZ #Carly2016
I am prepared to be a President who will lead the resurgence of this great nation, here at home and around the world. #Carly2016
I will recognize dangers w/ eyes wide open but will also embrace w/ open arms the enormous opportunities &amp; potential of these amazing times.
And as we tragically know, those ripples can too easily land on our shores. #Carly2016 (2/2)
When we abandon an ally or embolden an adversary, it reverberates throughout the world. #Carly2016 (1/2)
I am deeply proud of our extraordinary nation and grateful to be an American. #Carly2016
Margaret Thatcher once said that she was not content to manage the decline of a great nation. Neither am I. #Carly2016
It is the height of hypocrisy for @HillaryClinton to run for President as a champ. of women's rights when her record as SOS is this dismal.
China, Russia, Iran, &amp; terrorist groups such as ISIS – these are the big human rights tests of our time. #Carly2016
In February 2009, she told us we couldn’t let human rights get in the way of our other goals.
.@HillaryClinton likes to talk about her support of human rights, women's rights and democracy. Her actions conflict with her words.
Once again, the gov’t bureaucracy was too bloated &amp; inept to act &amp; the political classes were too complacent to stop it. #Carly2016
The Chinese steal our intellectual property w/ impunity &amp; engage in state-sponsored cyberterrorism. #Carly2016
We must tell China—if you declare an Air Defense Identification Zone over the South China Sea, we will not recognize it. We will not comply.
We must push back against rising Chinese aggression. We should work w/ Vietnam &amp; the Philippines to improve their surveillance capabilities.
China is using their economic might to rewrite the global order. #Carly2016
Here is another truth we must see and speak and act upon. China is our rapidly rising adversary. #Carly2016
We must have the strongest military on the face of the planet &amp; everyone has to know it. #Carly2016
When we do not stand with our allies nor confront our adversaries, our friends lose courage and our enemies press forward. #Carly2016
This administration’s blind eye to aggression has become a black eye to America. #Carly2016
This administration has continued to build a relationship w/ our enemies. When you reward bad behavior, you get more of it. #Carly2016
She must be prepared to challenge the status quo &amp; the way things are – whether in Washington or around the world. #Carly2016
The next President must reestablish our leadership-- she must speak with clarity &amp; act with courage. #Carly2016
My speech at @ronaldreagan40 will be streamed live here. Join me at 9:00 p.m. ET. https://t.co/znQl9Vc6cV #Carly2016

Want to see my speech last night on the state of women in America? @fxnopinion has the text here--&gt; http://t.co/6hIJkjBvJg #empoweredwomen
Let us ensure that this nation is one in which every person knows they can choose a life of dignity, purpose and meaning. #empoweredwomen
We must aim high as a nation. We must aim high in our families and in our communities. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
Lastly, we must tackle the webs of dependence that are trapping women today. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
We also need to support small businesses. Women-owned businesses are vitally important to our economy. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
It’s time for over-the-counter birth control, which will drive down prices and increase availability. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
In fact, single mothers earn $19,000 dollars less per year than married mothers. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
We also know that reducing out-of-wedlock births is critical. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
It is especially critical for low-income women and families that we fix our broken education system. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
Let’s move to a pay-for-performance meritocracy and make promoting high-achieving men and women a top priority. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
There are many things that we can and must do so that all women can truly choose their own paths. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
The Left's view of feminism is not about women. And their policies are not working for women. #empoweredwomen #ceidinner
Recent studies from the NYU Child Study Center suggest that a girl's self-esteem peaks at age 9 and declines from there. #empoweredwomen
My experience tells me that human potential is limitless. Usually, it is underutilized or worse, squandered and wasted. #empoweredwomen
My #CenterSeat interview with @BretBaier airs on @SpecialReport tonight. http://t.co/wMblSWe6qd #Carly2016
@FlaglerGOP thank you for your question! You can contact our campaign at info@carlyforpresident.com

Unlike @HillaryClinton, I know flying is an activity not an accomplishment. #CPAC2015
It makes all the difference in the world &amp; the required response has never come, @HillaryClinton. #CPAC2015
It’s not leadership when @HillaryClinton asks: “What difference does it make?” #CPAC2015
We need leaders that will change the order of things. #CPAC2015
We need leaders but not managers. We need leaders who do not accept what is broken because it’s always been that way. #CPAC2015

A powerful response to tonight's #SOTU from @joniernst. #RepublicanResponse
President Obama's words may have been soaring, but his actions continue to be hypocritical. #SOTU
But no mention of the persecution of Christians around the world? #SOTU
We’re missing leadership at home &amp; the world is missing American leadership abroad. A speech can’t hide that. #SOTU
President Obama called ISIS the "JV team” when their coming rise could not have been more clear. #SOTU
More government does not equal more success. Actually, quite the opposite. #SOTU
Time &amp; time again, Obama’s politics have obstructed commonsense policies, like building #KXL. #SOTU
Entrepreneurs &amp; small businesses create middle-class jobs, but Obama’s policies are making life harder for both. #SOTU
