@BestBuySupport no
@BestBuySupport She said she was the supervisor of dispatch. She was  super unhelpful and didn’t even try to find another solution
@BestBuySupport all of a sudden the last person said its not available and we could have someone to you NEXT FRIDAY. Seriously?
@BestBuySupport yes BUT that was after 42 min on the phone and 3 people telling me it was available with no problem. And then
@BestBuySupport wifi connection issues. Have had geek squad out before and in an emergency situation with our wifi speed
@GeekSquad for 40 minutes. TERRIBLE customer service. Unbelievable.
@GeekSquad someone said it would actually be next Friday!!! I was more than willing to pay the $250 emergency charge. But was led on
@GeekSquad you guys are a JOKE. Spent 40 min on phone, promised same day service would be possible - kept being transferred until finally
@comcastcares Been on phone for an hour with some crazy tech problem- SO UNHELPFUL &amp; then they randomly connect me with billing 😡

@AmericanAir please help. My stage clothes are in one of the bags and my custom made @shure microphone is in another one of the bags.
@AmericanAir We flew Bna to jfk to Manchester. AA the whole way yet she tagged it BA from jfk to Manchester but still with AA flight #.
@AmericanAir your agent in BNA mislabeled our connection as a BA flight to Manchester even though it was an AA flight. Her error completely.
@AmericanAir - it’s been 2 days of hrs on hold, &amp; a diff story from everyone we talk to and STILL NO BAGS. This is ridiculous.

BAM BAM KAM!!!!!!!!!
@traviceobas @DougBaldwinJr @Seahawks we are too!!! He’s amazing! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💙💚
Yes!! TOUCHDOWN! 9-7….but if we would’ve kicked that FG it’d be 10-9…ok I’ll let it go hahaha
@JanaJackson2010 getting stronger every day! 🙌🏻
Annnnd another field goal. But I thought y’all said the ball was supposed to be like a brick. 😏 #onmysoapbox #comeonHawks #istillbelieve
After the latest Vikings field goal, I still think the Hawks should’ve TRIED to kick a FG in the 1st half. 😐
Thank you for the clarification. I know it’s ridiculously cold but didn’t think of how that would make the ball like a brick #SEAvsMIN
Someone explain to me why they didn’t just try to kick a field goal???? #SEAvsMIN
Home from church and ready for the game! GO @Seahawks!!! #webelieve #familyof12s #12sinNashville #seattlestrong https://t.co/xnEw1sqYNg
