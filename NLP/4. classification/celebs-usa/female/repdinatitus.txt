My heart breaks for Aurora today. I’m grateful to the first responders on the scene. We simply cannot continue to respond to the epidemic of gun violence with inaction.
This is a major victory for Nevadans and for everyone who cares about the safety of our communities. Congratulations to the #NVLeg and @GovSisolak on a job well done. Now it’s time for Congress to pass #HR8 to expand background checks and reduce gun violence nationally. https://t.co/LgiC7VDhia
When discussing his illegal plan to build the wall, Trump just admitted, "I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster."  Does that sound like a legitimate national emergency to anyone? It certainly doesn't to me. I bet it won't to the courts either.
Declaring a national emergency to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power. https://t.co/BVwqQI66X6
I'll work with my colleagues to pursue all possible legal and legislative remedies to prevent President Trump from constructing this vanity project. The symbol of America must always remain the Statue of Liberty, not a border wall. (2/2)
Donald Trump's claim that there is a crisis at the border is simply not true. Declaring a national emergency to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power. (1/2)
I’m sending my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the cowardly terrorist attack in India’s Jammu and Kashmir state today. #KashmirTerrorAttack
Instead of answering my questions directly, the Trump Administration officials repeated meaningless platitudes. I will continue to work with Governor Sisolak and the Nevada Delegation to hold the DOE’s feet to the fire and protect our state and its people. (2/2)
The Department of Energy has lied to Nevadans and their elected representatives for decades, and I have no reason to believe that will change. In today’s meeting about @NNSANews's unchecked and unethical decision to secretly ship plutonium to Nevada, I learned nothing new. (1/2)

Trump’s #SOTU was long on promises and short on substance. I wish I could say that I'm surprised that he spent much of his speech demonizing immigrants, but didn’t find the time to say a single word about reducing gun violence.
Ending the spread of HIV is a noble goal. So why did the President fire all the members of his HIV/AIDS advisory council? #SOTU
The commitments the President is making about infrastructure in tonight's #SOTU sound a lot like the commitments he made last year...and then forgot about.
I noticed something weird in the House chamber tonight. When Trump mentioned building the wall, Republicans didn't shout out that Mexico would pay for it.  #SOTU
"Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways," says the President who proposed cutting legal immigration in half. #SOTU
Donald Trump is bragging about cutting regulations that protect our clean air and water. He seems to think that siding with big banks over American consumers is something to be proud of. #SOTU

I know from experience that you can’t trust the Department of @ENERGY, especially under the Trump Administration, but we must do all we can to provide transparency about the secret plutonium shipment and get at the truth in order to protect the people of Nevada.
Nevada is home to the nation’s largest population of wild horses and burros. These symbols of the West are a source of pride for our residents, visitors, and tribal communities. Sadly, the Trump Administration is making it harder for us to protect these beautiful animals. https://t.co/0ghhWFGZPY

Now that Trump has finally agreed to sign the bills we’ve passed to re-open the government, I'll work with my colleagues to pursue immigration reform that reflects our values and protects our Dreamers. The symbol of America must always be the Statue of Liberty, not a border wall.
Trump’s shutdown forced over 3,500 federal workers in Nevada to miss two paychecks, strained our airports, curtailed food inspections, and made it harder for FBI agents to take criminals off our streets.
It took far too long for this senseless Trump tantrum to come to an end. Trump said he would be "proud" to shut down the government, but the consequences of this shutdown are nothing to be proud of.
Enough is enough, Mr. President. Your tantrum has gone on far too long. Let's #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/uMq2iXyy6j
The "law and order" President has certainly surrounded himself with a whole lot of people who don't seem to think twice about violating federal laws.

Instead of working to #EndtheShutdown, Donald Trump is making new demands. He is preventing federal employees from getting the paychecks they have earned.

This reckless DOJ reversal will inject uncertainty into a well-regulated market and push consumers back into the black market. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration only supports states’ rights when it is politically convenient. https://t.co/2Y9M3yST0b
The Trump Administration has twice tried and failed to allow employers to deny workers contraceptive coverage. As a member of the @ProChoiceCaucus I welcome this news, but the fight to protect access to affordable #BirthControl continues. https://t.co/ryp0anx3VZ
Mr. President, our federal workers should not be pawns in your twisted political games. They are real families needlessly suffering because of the #TrumpShutdown. Stop holding their paychecks hostage for your vanity project.
I'm excited to announce that Vinny Spotleson is joining #TeamTitus as our District Director. He brings years of valuable experience to our Las Vegas office and I know his leadership and political acumen will serve our constituents well.

With the rise in anti-Semitism around the globe, it is shameful that the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism at the @StateDept remains unfilled. I’m glad my House colleagues just passed the legislation I cosponsored to quickly fill and strengthen this position.
From our roads to our skies, our nation must be better prepared to spot the signs and stop the crimes of human trafficking. #NationalHumanTraffickingAwarenessDay reminds us that we all can play a role in helping to protect victims and prevent future crimes.

It’s long past time our #BlueWaterNavy veterans get the care and benefits they have earned. That’s why I’m proud to help @RepMarkTakano introduce the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act and end this injustice.
Trump said he would be ‘proud’ to shut down the government over a border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for - and in the process he’s preventing thousands of Nevadans from receiving their paychecks. The American people have had enough of this latest Trump tantrum.
Congratulations @MichaelNaft! While we will miss you dearly, I cannot think of a better person to serve the people of District A and the state of Nevada. https://t.co/wUvVLPfATy

For over 420,000 federal employees, their families, and the countless businesses impacted, this shutdown is more than some political blip. Real people are hurting because of the stubbornness of one man. #TrumpShutdown
We are now 12 days into the #TrumpShutdown. Democrats have a solution to reopen govt. with the already-passed, bipartisan Senate bills. Trump says he prefers to keep the govt. closed.

My bill also creates an @NSF grant program to give at-risk K-12 students the tools they need to pursue #STEM education from the very beginning and support their STEM teachers. (4/4)
That is why I introduced the Training Highly Skilled Americans Act, a bill to increase federal investment in #STEM learning at #MSIs like @UNLV and @CSNCoyote through scholarships, grants, and loan forgiveness. (3/4)
African Americans make up only 9% of #STEM workers - Hispanics make up only 7% - Women hold approximately 24% of STEM jobs. (2/4)
Women make up a majority of advanced degree holders in the United States, and we are seeing growth in minorities attaining postgraduate education. Yet women and people of color are underrepresented in the #STEM fields. (1/4) https://t.co/u6Lb5e722f
The Senate is set to act on short-term CR later today. The bill keeps the govt. funded through Feb. 8, but doesn't #SaveLWCF. Looking forward to working with Chairman @RepRaulGrijalva to get this done next year. https://t.co/zQScWKzL8U

Congress needs to act. That is why I introduced the bipartisan Closing the #BumpStock Loophole Act along with Reps. Fitzpatrick, Kildee, and Trott. I'm working w/ my colleagues to remove any question about authority and get these devices off the market. (2/3)
The Admin. has released its final rule to ban #bumpstocks. Since it was first announced I raised concerns this would be tied up in the courts as ATF has repeatedly said it doesn't have this authority. (1/3)

@lifeandstuff247 It was included in the Rule for the bill, which I opposed.
The #GLOBEAct also ensures that #LGBTI individuals who face persecution have fair access to U.S. asylum and refugee programs. I am proud to have @RepZoeLofgren, Ranking Member of the Subcmte on Immigration and Border Security, join me in introducing this bill. 🏳️‍🌈🌍
I am proud to have @RepEliotEngel, next Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, join me in introducing the #GLOBEAct to call for U.S. leadership in multilateral organizations in the fight for #LGBTI rights. 🏳️‍🌈🌍
The #GLOBEAct would ensure that U.S. foreign assistance and global health programs are inclusive of #LGBTI populations, including by repealing the #GlobalGagRule, a fight @NitaLowey has helped lead. 🏳️‍🌈🌍
The bill also builds on the work of @RepLowenthal's International Human Rights Defense Act to codify the Special Envoy for the Human Rights of #LGBTI persons at @StateDept #GLOBEAct 🏳️‍🌈🌍
The #GLOBEAct builds on the work of @davidcicilline's Global Respect Act to use sanctions to punish those responsible for egregious murders of and abuses directed at LGBTI populations. 🏳️‍🌈🌍
Today I introduced the #GLOBEAct to outline a vision for U.S. leadership in the protection of the rights of #LGBTI individuals around the world. Congress will not stand idly by as the Trump Admin. fails to acknowledge and respond to bigotry and violence against LGBTI people. 🏳️‍🌈🌍 https://t.co/CLLVRlrP6g
Our #farmersmarkets benefit local farmers &amp; boost nutrition in our communities. The #FarmBill2018 provides $25 million to increase access to locally grown food and to help farmers markets take root in cities like Las Vegas.
Hey, NV farmers. How about growing #hemp instead of alfalfa? A breakthrough in the #FarmBill2018 lifts restrictions on legalized hemp production. Together we can cultivate a potentially multi-billion dollar crop that makes everything from rope to soap!
The #FarmBill2018 protects animals by criminalizing the killing of cats &amp; dogs for human consumption, protecting pets of domestic violence survivors, and extending prohibitions on animal fighting.
Cruel GOP efforts to destroy #SNAP have been defeated in the #FarmBill2018. I opposed these cuts from the start and applaud the final agreement’s investments in nutrition programs and food banks. #EndHungerNow

On #VeteransDay we pause to honor the brave Airmen, Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who have served our country in the armed forces. Their sacrifice and commitment to American ideals have helped shape our democracy and remind us of what unites us.
Our veterans of all war eras, men and women, LGBT, and of diverse backgrounds, deserve our deepest gratitude.
We can never fully repay them for their service and sacrifice; but we can do more to help our veterans in their transition to civilian life through access to quality education, careers, and more effective post-service care.
I hope you will join me in taking a moment this Veterans Day to reflect on the family member, friend, or stranger who answered the call to service. They deserve our thanks every day.
During my time in Congress, I have worked to give our veterans and their families those opportunities, and I will continue to fight to ensure they receive the resources, benefits, and care they deserve.

Today marks both 100 years since the end of World War I and #VeteransDay. Let us take a moment to recognize and remember the brave men and women who have served and protected our nation. #ArmisticeDay100 🇺🇸 https://t.co/sJr3EJtojS

Grateful for @SalvationArmyUS’s dedication to our #Veterans. Today, we cut the ribbon on their expanded Community Integration Program. It more than doubles the number of beds and services available. https://t.co/zsPtU4KH1V
Sri Lanka's political crisis continues to devolve into chaos. As Co-Chair of the Sri Lanka Caucus, I joined @RepEliotEngel and @RepDavidEPrice in urging @MaithripalaS to reverse course and let Parliament perform its constitutional duties. https://t.co/JAcIUHGAA1
While the President continues to show total disregard for our nation’s laws and values, I will never stop defending the right to seek #asylum for those who seek a better life in our country.
In his quest to stoke fear and hate, President Trump has sent troops to the border, separated families, and now will deprive immigrants who are fleeing violence and persecution of their right to apply for #asylum. https://t.co/li2BWOPf8g
On #FirstGenDay, I applaud the perseverance &amp; accomplishments of first generation students everywhere. I had a number of #firstgen students in my classes when I was a professor at @unlv, and will continue to support their success. #CelebrateFirstGen https://t.co/MH5MAZ4vNK
On #NationalSTEMDay and everyday, I’m pleased to support programs like the @CongressionalAC, which encourages #STEM education in our middle schools.
Allowing employers to deny women contraception and abortion coverage for religious or moral objections is wrong. As a member of the #ProChoiceCaucus I will continue to fight Trump’s efforts to imperil women’s access to birth control and right to choose. https://t.co/NmaN366AGB
This federal court decision on #DACA confirms what we already knew. Congress must step up and #ProtectDREAMers.  https://t.co/04Jkmmtqxy
I’ve introduced and supported numerous pieces of common sense legislation to address gun violence, yet the Republican-controlled Congress has refused to even consider them. That will change come January.
In 2018 alone, there have been over 48,900 incidents of gun violence, including 307 mass shootings. Over 12,400 of our family members, friends, and neighbors have died. #EnoughIsEnough
The nation is waking up to the news of another horrific mass shooting - this time at a bar in #ThousandOaks, CA. My thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones, but we need more than thoughts and prayers. We need action.
#TeamTitus was proud to join @TeamRWB for the #OldGloryRelay as they passed through #NV01 https://t.co/bpn2TGMmcl

102 years ago today the first woman, Jeannette Rankin, was elected into the U.S. House of Representatives, 3 years before women gained the right to vote. Now, history is being made with more women than ever before elected to serve in the U.S. Congress. #womenrun2018 https://t.co/21uKqLUrqA

The people have spoken, and they want results from their Congress. We have many challenges but Democrats must listen and immediately push for action on commonsense gun violence legislation, protecting our DREAMers, and real investment in infrastructure. I’m ready to get to work.

That’s why I’ll be reintroducing the #WeekendsWithoutHunger Act, a bill to provide nutritious food to at-risk school children over weekends and holidays. Because a vacation from school should never mean hunger for children. #NSLW18
While school meals keep children healthy &amp; focused during the school day, kids in food-insecure households sometimes go hungry when school is not in session. No child should wonder where their next meal is coming from when they leave school. #NSLW18
It’s #NationalSchoolLunchWeek! According to @threesquareLV, over 62% of children in CCSD received free or reduced-price meals in the 2017-18 school year. That's more than 203,000 students who came to school hungry &amp; unprepared to learn. #NSLW18

I helped author the Closing the Bump Stock Loophole Act to give ATF the authority it needs, but Republicans have blocked it. Extreme gun groups know Trump's moves won't stand up in court. This is nothing but smoke and mirrors and delay.
President is claiming that he "knocking out bump stocks." He is either lying or naive. You can buy them today. Meaningful action requires a change of law. The ATF has been clear about that.

This #GOPTaxScam is only a thinly veiled attempt to repackage their disastrous trickle-down economics that has failed the American people.
I have heard from constituents about problems created from the sloppy drafting of the first tax scam, but this bill addresses none of these. Instead, GOP is creating bigger giveaway for wealthiest in our country and expecting middle class families to pick up $3.2 trillion tab.
#GOPTaxScam is another attempt by Republicans to reward the nation’s wealthiest and largest corporations while setting working families up to pay for an increasing deficit by slashing Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.

After writing to @usairforce with several colleagues in June, I’m glad to see they will be following U.S. Army and Navy in allowing use of Truvada for #PrEP by pilots to reduce risk of HIV. An important step to help reduce Air Force pilot shortage and protect our Airmen. https://t.co/Jt4PteafFy
@openletterbot @Donna_West Hi Donna, I too oppose the privatization scheme the Republicans pushed. This new long-term bill includes provisions I fought for that protect travelers and aviation workers and supports the economy of Southern Nevada. I will vote for this bill this week.

First Trump ripped immigrant families apart at the border. Now he is targeting them again by making basic human needs a bargaining chip. #ProtectFamilies

Today in @HouseForeign, Republicans voted to block H.Res. 1017 requiring the Admin. to turn over documents related to the Trump-Putin Helsinki mtg, putting party over country and evading our Committee's oversight duty. The American people deserve information about that meeting.

This is a good win for the people of Nevada, but so long as Donald Trump is in the Oval Office and Republicans control Congress we will continue to face this fight each year.
First set of FY19 appropriations bills released. After pushing back against Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans' plan to dump nuclear waste in Nevada there is no funding for Yucca Mountain project.

Given the Department’s dismal record of not following through with its projects, I question whether the program at Los Alamos will ever come to fruition or if this is simply a quick, cheap way for DOE to respond to the court order.

The Trump Admin. is about to allow blueprints for print-at-home, untraceable #3Dguns to be released on the internet. Today I wrote AG Laxalt asking him to intervene on behalf of the State of Nevada. This is a major safety threat. https://t.co/nvwoiv5LUq

Animal abuse is often an early indicator of a person’s willingness to hurt others. That’s why I’m cosponsoring the AVERT Future Gun Violence Act w/ @RepKClark , to keep guns out of the hands of those who have been convicted of animal cruelty.
If this is what was said publicly I have grave concerns about what was discussed during the one-on-one meeting.
Responding to the question of Russia's meddling in our elections, the President dismissed our own defense and intelligence agencies and instead retreated to a puppet-like response of Putin's "strong and powerful" denial.
The President of the United States was asked to name just one issue where Russia is to blame for the state of relations between our nations. He could not name one. Instead reverts to the #BothSides rhetoric he used to defend racists in Charlottesville.
The President of the United States of America just took to the podium and repeatedly attacked the United States while defending Russia - playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin.

#ICYMI, the Trump Administration announced it was reversing the #NationalOceanPolicy established under Obama. This is a huge gift for oil drillers. Bad news for our coastal communities and our fight against global climate change. https://t.co/cMTCJpXN4J

@Keetatay @NORML Hi Rav, I get the confusion from the title of the bill, but at the federal level, regulation of alcohol is limited to criminal trafficking and illicit activities. This bill actually protects legal marijuana businesses and users by removing MJ from the CSA.
The Trump Admin. is refusing to stand up for Nevadans with pre-existing conditions. Remember the days before the #AffordableCareAct when people were denied coverage or simply could not afford it? I will continue to combat GOP efforts to sabotage the ACA. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/KDfiZiX0y4
On this Father’s Day let us remember the children being torn from their parents’ arms. The Trump policy of family separation goes against basic human values. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Thanks to @LVCCLD for hosting the 8th Annual #Juneteenth Celebration. https://t.co/0dGQlhuH80
Republican leaders say they don’t want children torn from their parents. So I call on them to join me in passing the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end the nightmare for immigrant families. (4/4)
The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct prohibits family separation, requires our government to reunify parents and children, and makes clear that family unity is paramount in our nation’s immigration policy. (3/4)
In addition to the resolution I cosponsored last week, I’m cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to push back against the Trump Admin’s cruel policy of separating families. (2/4)
The Trump/Sessions policy to separate families at the border is inhumane and must be met with words and actions. #KeepFamiliesTogether (1/4) https://t.co/hgmNIKV2CP

@MickyWhiteNV I call 'em like I see 'em.
See my statement on the passage of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, AKA Screw Nevada 2.0. I've long fought the terrible #YuccaMountain project, and I'm not giving up now. https://t.co/wSjLaraq64
On the floor of the House to speak out against this misguided attempt to turn Nevada into the nation’s dumping ground for highly radioactive nuclear waste.

Today @SenateDems file the petition to force a vote on the Senate floor to restore #NetNeutrality and they only need #OneMoreVote! As a strong supporter of net neutrality and a cosponsor of the House companion bill, I urge you to make your voices heard! https://t.co/gxaC5DpAGv
Always great to discuss the importance of travel and tourism with @AAHOA. Thank you for having me. https://t.co/jFVawCDZlH
My amendment was made in order and I'll offer it on the floor of the House this Thursday. The Titus Amendment is commonsense and based on the #1 recommendation from the esteemed Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future.
#ICYMI, this afternoon I testified on my amendment to H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. This pro-Yucca Mountain bill doubles down on bad policy. The Titus Amendment establishes a consent based approach to get at the root of this problem. https://t.co/zEBHKWgy0i

Heading to the House Rules Committee to testify on my amendment to the pro-Yucca Mountain bill coming to the floor. My amendment strikes this bad bill and establishes a consent based siting process for nuclear waste repositories. You can watch here: https://t.co/B5389ula4y

#NursesWeek2018 is the perfect time to recognize the hard work of nurses, especially in our schools. My bill, the NURSE Act, will help schools hire more full-time nurses, because healthier students are better prepared to learn. https://t.co/A9CYFbfNNO
With a pro-Yucca Mountain bill coming to the floor this week, I filed an amendment that would strike the language and instead establish a consent based siting process. Nevada does not want nuclear waste, but other states do. They can have it. https://t.co/0eKERDdFt4

Next week, Rep. Shimkus will bring his Screw Nevada 2.0 Bill to the floor. This legislation to rubber-stamp the licensing of Yucca Mountain to turn Nevada into the nation's nuke waste dump is bad policy, and I'll continue to fight it every step of the way. #NotAWasteland
The latest lawsuit from the @TXAG to end #DACA is appalling. This morning, I sent a letter to AG @AdamLaxalt requesting that Nevada stay away from this lawsuit and remember the contributions of DACA recipients in Nevada. https://t.co/cIc9PWnkNL

House Republicans have sunk to a new low; firing the House Chaplain because, like Pope Francis, he cares about poor people too much.
Today the house passed H.R. 4; the FAA Reauthorization bill. This five year bill contains a number of wins for Nevada on UAS, our airports, and for the safety of our aviation workers and travelers. See my full statement below. ✈️ https://t.co/BW3YUYaKGc
The Trump Administration’s decision to end the #TPS designation for #Nepal is callous, yet unsurprising. Congress should pass the #AmericanPromiseAct, which I cosponsored, to prevent TPS recipients from being ripped from their communities. https://t.co/wi9ZoaqCbq

Disappointed the Senate confirmed #MikePompeo to serve as Secretary of State. As I have said before, his record gives me no confidence that he will be a good representative for U.S. or defend the rights of most vulnerable communities, including LGBTI and women, around the globe.
@1HavasuCat @tomangell @PassHR1227 I do support descheduling, but I think H.R. 1227 is not the right approach. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1841, the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act w/ @JaredPolis. This bill removes MJ from the schedule.
Today, I am joining a bipartisan group of members to introduce the Medical Cannabis Research Act. This bill prevents Jeff Sessions from standing in the way of the important and long-overdue research into the health benefits of cannabis. https://t.co/JipczJEScm
@kisselAP It’s thanks...
Glad to see that Sessions listened to Congress and reversed his decision to suspend the Legal Orientation Program #LOP.

Republicans pass third bill this week to roll back financial protections instead of taking up gun violence prevention legislation, a bill to #protectDREAMers, or legislation to protect the Special Counsel's investigation.

Our backlogged immigration court system leaves too many lives in limbo, but setting case quotas for judges is not the answer. Instead of expediting justice, this policy will make it difficult for judges to give cases full &amp; fair consideration. @immcouncil https://t.co/6p2smQ02Kl

When Trump signed an order to end the #DACA program, he did so by claiming that these children, who were brought here through no fault of their own, are victimizing millions of Americans. His decision then and his comments now reveal his true nature and his xenophobic beliefs.

This morning Democrats will once again try to force a vote on the #DreamAct. This will be the 21st time we have asked Republicans to take action on the floor to protect DREAMers since Trump ended DACA. Again they will ignore our calls for action.

How do Seniors fare under the GOP Budget Resolution? Poorly. Medicare is cut by $473 billion over 10 years.
How will women, children, &amp; at-risk families fare w/ GOP budget resolution? Poorly. It cuts billions over 10 yrs from SNAP, WIC, TANF, SSI.

So, what's the takeaway from the #Oversight hearing? A lot of folks are trying to dump #NukeWaste in a place they know nothing about.
The so-called "experts" in Oversight hearing on nuclear waste don't even know the difference between Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site
Hey @DarrellIssa, #YuccaMountain doesn't pass the #IssaTest for safety. Less than 100mi from #LasVegas, on an aquifer, on a fault line...
Thank you @RepRaskin for demanding answers about consent-based siting. Communities that don't want/create nuclear waste shouldn't have it.
In 2017 $$, Yucca Mtn costs $95 billion over the length of its license. Nevada &amp; the US Treasury cannot afford this unworkable project.
.@UCSUSA is pointing out flaws of the unworkable #YuccaMtn project. When will the @GOP listen?  https://t.co/OaQZeOQxBK

#EqualityDay marks the anniversary of 4 landmark SCOTUS rulings for #LGBT equality. Proud to celebrate &amp; continue to fight w/ @LGBTEqCaucus. https://t.co/2TsyR6SOj6

We thank the men and women who sacrificed so much for their service in the Korean War. https://t.co/XaNNfhJGfz
In NV, the Senate's version of Trumpcare will cost thousands their insurance plans &amp; hundreds of millions per year. It is a disaster https://t.co/HrRdTi8e6J
If GOP can't get the votes to gut the ACA now, they will try other options. That's why we need to protect Americans &amp; have #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/87gUDlEchB
Thank you! https://t.co/jXuwNdo05E
Transgender Americans must be able to openly serve in the military. The @DeptofDefense must not discriminate.
@darts89119, I am a co-sponsor of the #MedicareForAll bill
I will be on @MSNBC at noon ET/ 9 AM PT to talk about the Senate's disastrous health care bill &amp; the havoc it would wreak on NV.
I will continue to work to make certain that Las Vegas receives its fair share of homeland security funding. https://t.co/SpKraOEHdK
When @SecretaryZinke visits NV he should visit @goldbutte &amp; #BasinAndRange &amp; see for himself why they must remain protected.
Mama and I thank longtime friend Mayor Andy Hafen for his years of service to @cityofhenderson and our community. https://t.co/Gf6O3qhbsy
I voted against HR2842 today bc NV could lose $700K next year in TANF funding.
.@LVMPD will receive a $500k DHS grant. I will always fight for the security of Las Vegas &amp; work to bring more resources to the community. https://t.co/IWS5ttoNAe

.@ezraklein is right. The Senate bill isn't a handout to insurance companies; it's a payoff.
Thank you @VetsVillageLV for your dedication to our nation's heroes &amp; our community. https://t.co/EAcmEyHync
Another tax break for the president. https://t.co/THZSamPILL
.@GOP shines a light on its priorities in this bill. This is despicable. https://t.co/dP9hIf2050
No lawmaker in good conscience could vote for the Senate's version of Trumpcare. It is just as callous as the House version. https://t.co/UYKnbhhghR
Trumpcare 2.0 is just as callous as the 1st version. It terminates Medicaid expansion, imposes an age tax, &amp; revokes the guarantee for EHBs. https://t.co/vsKr3pCSca
I call on Nevada's senators to reject this version of Trumpcare, a plan to benefit the wealthiest at the expense of working families. https://t.co/YaNU0npFZO
Tune into @KNPRnews now to hear what I am doing to fight Trump &amp; @SecretaryPerry on Yucca Mtn. https://t.co/UYUaLUtsXI
Senate bill expected to give tax cuts to 400 richest Americans, equaling the federal cost of maintaining expansion in NV, WV, AR, &amp; AK.
1 year &amp; countless tragedies since @repjohnlewis, @HouseDemocrats, &amp; I had a sit-in to fight for gun-violence-prevention. @GOP still silent. https://t.co/dmm81mKGoT

.@SecretaryPerry says let's work together. How about consent-based siting? Ohh wait. He took down the site: https://t.co/L5D2wKMO6Q
@dawnstover The Trump Admin threw that out the window. Here is what Perry did to the consent-based website: https://t.co/L5D2wKMO6Q

The Trump Doctrine: cut the programs that don't bring him millions. https://t.co/fUdtpyE9Cd
@PalePavon @TimRunsHisMouth I did live in the district. It was redistricting that changed my residence to my current district. 89119 is my zip https://t.co/nUXyoiIlqo

They want to usurp NV's water rights to ram Yucca Mtn down our throats. Be aware: If they can take ours, they can take yours. https://t.co/L9cqT4CbzK
#DACAversary reminds us of the work that still must be done for hardworking families in our nation. I won't stop fighting for what's right.
Informing lawmakers &amp; others abt waste traveling to Yucca going through 329 districts as @RepShimkus marks up bill to jam down NV's throat. https://t.co/ICQCw6JWzg
