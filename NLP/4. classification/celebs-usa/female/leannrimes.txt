This @Nordstrom commercial has my heart! ❤️ #oscars2019
@aswinn @Nike This commercial is CRAZY 😜 So good! Here’s to more insanity!!
Re-imagining #borrowed with my LovE @StevieNicks was hands down one of my favorite projects so far and I’m honored that the track will be featured on her new compilation ‘Stand Back: 1981-2017’. https://t.co/y9M7zVQ7S8
@chippydasilva @schoppbcubfan It happens all the time. You should come to a live show sometime 👍🏼☺️❤️
It’s been 20 years to the day that 16 year old me, got to release ‘Written In The Stars’ with one of the greatest artists in the world. Thankful for your LovE, support and most importantly your friendship over the years @eltonofficial! https://t.co/IFitH22GgC

@valerisue11 Nothing sounds better than Vinyl
@epberg At that point in my life I had a VERY short attention span in the studio. I never got pst more than 3 takes LOL
So important.... for anyone grieving, for anyone going through a dark moment, I see you, I understand. I myself am in and out of pain and sorrow right now and breathe is so crucial to getting through rough moments. all BREATHE my friends and take it slow. I LovE you 💕 https://t.co/Vzl411Wu8O

HELL YEAH @brandicarlile #GrammyAwards2019
I have so many feels for this little one. Wow - looking at her (me), knowing what I know now... she was a bad ass and a warrior. She still is ☺️ This moment was pretty incredible and unforgettable! Good luck to all who are nominated and performing tonight! #grammys2019 https://t.co/e4kxW6RP6i
@jannarden Preach
It happened #GirlScoutCookies https://t.co/uMbiWfjsEL
@MrLeeJukes @_KrisMeredith That sounds heavenly.... pun intended!
@DoreePriest Hahahaha - they’ll be cookies in my house before the weekend is over! 💯
Broke down in tears in the middle of the grocery store and dodged the Girl Scout cookies on the way out... if I have those cookies at home over the weekend while mourning, it will not be pretty! I’d say that was a good trip to the market 🙈 p.s. ❤️ the Girl Scouts &amp; their cookies
This is what creating for the sake of fun and passion for music and creation looks like. I’m so blessed to be a creator and and expressionist of truth in the incarnation.
The fun thing about these ”LovE Sessions” is that we literally pick a song, pull up the chords and lyrics, rehearse it a couple of times and record it once. So, what you get is raw and real and very unplanned. It’s literally from the heart.
There’s so much truth and beauty in the next #LovEsession song we chose, “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.” What a soul wrenching classic (in the best way of course). Watch the full video on @Youtube: https://t.co/sOz9xamkh7 https://t.co/m6w20zjcix
@KathySieger1 Thank you! Yes, we will see you soon ❤️
I am honestly overwhelmed at the outpouring of kindness and LovE sent our way. Our hearts are so broken right now. We are grateful for your prayers and understanding. ❤️
All tickets are valid for the rescheduled dates. We apologize for the inconvenience and LeAnn hopes to see you at the rescheduled shows.
Due to a sudden loss, the following shows are being rescheduled:  The Newton Theatre in NJ is being rescheduled to Thursday, May 2nd The Cabot in Beverly is being rescheduled to Thursday, February 28th The Flying Monkey in NH has been rescheduled to Friday, March 1st
