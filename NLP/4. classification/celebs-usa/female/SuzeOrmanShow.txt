I was just watching the latest episode of The Handmaiden on Hulu. We are now experiencing the real life version of this tv series when it comes to taking kids from their parents.   What Trump is doing may be legal but it is not moral or humane.  #Dumptrump
Besides the utter lack of humanity of what Trump is doing to thousands of kids and parents has anyone calculated the cost to separate them.  I have no doubt it will be tens of millions of dollars.  This is all just so emotionally and financially wrong. #MakeAmericaGoodAgain

Any savings from the tax cut just went out the window with what you will soon be paying for a gallon of gas.  You all need to know that US crude surged 3% to a 3½-year high, settling at $71.14. Why ? Cause the US quit the Iran nuclear deal. Now you know!

Consider a higher deductible on car insurance - it will reduce your cost by as much as 30%.

Buy your car. Don't lease. When you buy you'll eventually own a paid-off car. With leasing, you'll be making payments forever.
Buying a home? Add 40% to the monthly mortgage to account for the extra costs that come with ownership. Can you still afford it?

Best ways to improve your credit worthiness: pay bills on time, pay delinquent bills, and lower your total credit card debt.
Avoid private student loans. They can't be consolidated and interest rates aren't fixed so can keep rising as you pay.
Acting upon your own thoughts and feelings is a priceless gift that only you can give to yourself. https://t.co/x0ajyJwqt1
Never cosign a loan. Once you have cosigned, you can't get out of it - even on your deathbed.
Check your beneficiaries. Can't remember whom you named? That's my point! Make sure your money will go exactly where you want.
Remember, you will never be powerful in life until you are powerful over your own money.
Take charge of your destiny. https://t.co/Oqso4xKHvb

Every dollar you save today and every dollar of debt you pay down is an important step to the future you deserve!

Remember, the best personal financial advisor is you because no one is going to care more about your money than you do.
I highly recommend term life insurance. If you die during the term, it pays out a death benefit. And it's incredibly affordable.
Celebrate who you are! https://t.co/Ze1XFxHz5G
Don't scrimp on home or auto insurance. Buying "just enough" is one of the costliest mistakes you could make.
