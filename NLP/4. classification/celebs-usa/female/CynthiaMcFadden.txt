@jcobb1031 @11thHour @NBCNews British common law recognized birth right citizenship and so did US from the start.  Of course 14 th vital to extending it.  I was trying to explain where the motion came from.  Agree I should have done it better.
@sparafucile0 @NBCNews @11thHour I was trying to explain that concept of birth right citizenship began long before the 14 th A ‚Äî British common law provided for it and so did US from the start. I could have and should have done a better job explaining‚Äî But it wasn‚Äôt from lack of knowing significance of 14 th a.
@ConsiderBurke @NBCNews @11thHour You‚Äôre right about 14 th a.  But from the beginning  US followed British common law which provided for birth right citizenship. Concept didn‚Äôt originate with 14 th A.  I was trying to compress a lot of important ideas in a very brief amount of time. Wish I had been clearer.
Cold and beautiful. https://t.co/jKXT5GjKkX
@ObamasRearGuard @NBCNews @11thHour Of course that wasn‚Äôt the genesis of the 14 th a.  ‚Äî-What I was trying to say (clearly not very well) was that birth  right citizenship long pre-dated the 14 th A as the US followed the British common law which recognized it.  Sorry I bungled it.
@MishaDavidovich Of course that is what he 14 th amendment did.  But long before that the US recognized the birth right concept from British common law which is what I was trying to say but clearly didn‚Äôt do very well.
@pnwjourneys Agreed.
@pnwjourneys Long before the  14 th amendment the US recognized birth right citizenship under British common law.  That is what i was attempted to say. Poorly I admit.
@MishaDavidovich Of course.
.@11thHour viewers: I agree I did a lousy job explaining birth right citizenship. What I was trying to say was  even before the 14 th A. the birth right concept from British common law was recognized in US. Clearly I failed to compress a lot of important history into :10 seconds
