@Mix1041 Pardon me, but I never said any of that. I   approve of show white, and read it to my kids often. What I said was I ask them ?s abt the stories they read. Every story  Because I'm a good parent. Please stop using click bait, it's really tacky. And it's also libel.
@brooklfc35 @margotlily @yoda Actually, she did. She said alot more things, and if read in context, would probably clear up whatever misconceptions you received from the clickbait that u saw and didnt read.
@kathy_breen @daxshepard @minor757 Yes, kathy, absolutely!!! Xo your adopted granddaughter
@AGORACOM @markavilez89 @joey2900 @inclement_ivy I never sparked a public debate. I was interviewed about my parenting style, what I read to my kids and why. I answered honestly. And "spark" has been added by outlets and click bate. That's apparent when u read the origional interview which, not surprisingly, noone did.
@AGORACOM Since you didnt ask, I'll tell u my kids are 3 and 5. They dont understand death yet, so it's sort of moot to bring up. They do understand kissing and touching and permission. I'm encouraging them to have thoughtful conversations about the content they consume.
@patni1111 @PhilMcCrackin44 @Keira_Knightley It's cute that you guys are making jokes about something that I feel is very important. I'd be happy to send you copies and snow white and frozen, and you can see the differences. How far the example set for women has come. It might enlighten your point of view.
@SnookiLoveDolls Also congrats on honors :)  I have a family full of nurses, it's an excellent profession. And when the whole world goes AI, it may be the only profession left! So at least you'll have a job! Xoxoxo
@SnookiLoveDolls Apologies from me too-  I wasn't trying to be sarcastic like you didn't actually know the definition. Sometimes when I read a dictionary definition it clarifies the words true meaning a bit for me, and allows me to see less of what I've given it based on my societal influence.
@LUGO_RIVERA @Suffragentleman Cool use of sarcasm here. Nope, just trying to be a good mom, and believe me, they get plenty of visuals of chivalry every day when they see how @daxshepard treats me and all the women in his life.
@tristalblair @cbs46 It's ok if we disagree. We all have differnt points if view. .marshmallows always and forever. oxoxoxo
@SnookiLoveDolls The definition of critical thinking:" the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment."  I want my girls, even at age six to question things, in order to form thier judgement.
@thedayeltweets @Tru_Breezy @parentsmagazine You'll not give me CPR if I was dying bc I have a different point of view of a fairy tale? Harsh. Your bio say youre trying to make the world a better place. I wanna do that too. I just think thier are better ways to do it than threatening ppl on social media. Have a good day.
@kazweida ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
@cbs46 A news source should be more reliable than this. It will mean your viewers know your messing with them to get clicks. Its tacky and low. Please do better.
@cbs46 Sad that a CBS news affiliate is using tacky clickbait.What we know is YOU are taking things out of context b/c I didnt "Slam" anyone, &amp; saying that I did is libel. I shared that I ask my kids ?s abt whether or not theyd take food from strangers or like being kissed when asleep.
@daxshepard @TonyRobertsIV @benshapiro Xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo
@Dylanrockstar4 @dailyblastlive @Disney Hahahahah ❤❤❤
@dailyblastlive @Disney Thank u very much, I appreciate it. Xoxo
@debpf5684 @dailyblastlive @Disney Thank u for the reminder. I dont often come to Twitter anymore for that very  reason. I appreciate the reminder and the encouragement :)
@petemitchellmav @dailyblastlive @Disney Always :)
@dailyblastlive @Disney All questions a good parent asks to encourage critical thinking skills. Now that you have the facts, you can adjust your click bait articles accordingly. Xo
@dailyblastlive @Disney Who said I dont let me children watch Disney movies? That's untrue..so libel, maybe? I can fact check for u now: after reading/ watching snow white, I ask my girls if they would take food from a stranger, or feel uncomfortable if someone was kissing them while they were sleeping.
@Neoncamo14 @benshapiro Lets stick w/ the facts. u know NOTHING abt how I teach my children b/c weve never met, nor have u met my kids. But since u asked(read: sarcasm, b/c u weren't enlightened enough to actually ask):my kids r strong&amp;fiesty &amp;use critical thinking &amp; noone plays the victim in our home.
@shmondicles @benshapiro Thank u for a bit of sanity. I feel like eveyone has gone really crazy about this, maybe noone has anything better to do today?
@benshapiro Thx so much ben, I really appreciate it! (But real talk I know ur smarter than this snarky comment &amp; that u actually understand &amp; value parents teaching thier kids critical thinking-which is why I encourage my kids 2 ask lots of ?s abt stories they read-so pls dont be mean, ok?)
Thank u Margot, I find the outrage annoying and misplaced as well. I'm a mom who wants my girls to possess critical thinking and aks a ton of questions. So that's what we do when we read books. https://t.co/wptcM2DfLt
@LUGO_RIVERA @Suffragentleman Newsflash: bad moms Is an movie for grown ups, snow white is a film for kids who are mimicking behavior they see. I want my kids to be critical thinkers, which is why we ask alot of questions.
@LastWeekTonight Also, isnt it kind of ironic that his social feed is now the subject of your social feed to engage people? But your just making fun of him for trying and you're getting content out of it? The whole thing makes me sad.
@LastWeekTonight It makes me sad that you guys are poking fun on chris Cuomo:( Hes trying to engage people as one does on social media, and teach them more about the news he cares about in a way he thinks is fun. Hes trying.

@P0L0stl @lenadunham Anywho-i was more making a point abt what ppl spend thier time gossiping abt when they may not have the full story /7
@P0L0stl I guess I just have sympathy she may have been in the same situation, &amp; she a writer so doesn't surprise me she wrote abt giving him up. /6
@P0L0stl And bites her daily, the little shit. But I still love him like crazy. He just didn't do well w/the revolving door that is my home. /4
@P0L0stl But sometimes it's better for the dog 2 have a place he can thrive. Was hard for me, but now one of my 🐕 lives w/my mom /3
@P0L0stl The latter just doesn't seem plausable 2 me. &amp; Having been there I know it's an excrutiating decision to let a dog u love live elsewhere/3
@P0L0stl Rather than she got a dog, abused him for 4yrs, then made an announcement that she was giving him away &amp; drew attn 2 the fact that she did/2
@P0L0stl I guess I just mean I think its more believable that her dog started nipping &amp; she decided he was better suited somewhere else /1
@P0L0stl U hear ya. I've had 15 dogs &amp; as many fosters- &amp; also had to place 1 in a diff home cuz of biting that happened after he lived w/us 4 awhile
@P0L0stl @lenadunham You can leave what Veronica Mars would do to me bro, I know her a bit better than you. &amp; I really like acting, I think I will stick to it!

@melpal83 @daxshepard1 Wednesday!
@Claranevs @BTDivide Love u girl. So proud. Xo
@evelynisaacks @furrytrashyt @AmyErikson https://t.co/bWVOKKPSjn
Generation Z looking for political discussions in a positive &amp; respectful manner. Check out the future at https://t.co/HiTpHvRMi9
@siskanay316 Agreed.
@gonesgirI I am a good person. No white or black. I also prefer protests where no one gets hurt. Continued support for your cause, &amp; equality for all.
@HolaAriel That was my intent, Thank you Ariel. All love always xo
@ginjasnappy I agree- I am just hopeful for a future when peaceful protest can accomplish the same and no one gets hurt.
@BrookeObie Fuck yes. It's what I truly stand for. Always. Xo
@Vox_de_Igne @anthoknees I fully agree &amp; apologize-that wasn't what I meant.it was short sited of me not to realize how my tweet could be misinterpreted.All love xo
@_Zeets Sorry if my tweet seemed 2 say something I wasn't intending. I appreciate ur criticism &amp; will choose wiser words in the future. All love xo
@_Zeets I won't ignore any successful resolution- my hope is we can get 2 a point where EVERYONE can fight 4 what they believe in w/out getting hurt
@BrookeObie I'm sorry that's how my tweet was interpreted- it was not what I was trying to say. Will choose wiser words to clarify in the future.
@BrookeObie I fully agree. Apologies- I was not indending to compare the two marches at all-simply to point out i didn't want anyone hurt either time.
I appreciate the criticism I recieved-Had no intent to offend/divide.I Support always making voices heard so others can learn&amp;understand 2/2
Took down a misunderstood tweet, &amp; i see how what I wrote was a mistake, as it failed to clarify my sentiment . 1/2
@debafield Xoxoxo so are u- helping people who need it is who we should be.
Dear @POTUS,  You ARE my president. That means you have a duty to listen to and represent me.
@_SweetCaiity Do some yoga or meditate. Halt all multitasking. Focus on breathing for 20 mins. That helps.
@LindseyBethSays Sure did.
@andthekisses That's who I would like my kids to look up to.
@andthekisses Ah ok! I misunderstood! Maybe violence has made change in the past but I think MLK &amp; others who preach peace are setting the best example.
Violent, no. Petty useless &amp; unhelpful- YES. We have to stay classy and respectful. We should only go high. Anything else is juat nonsense. https://t.co/pFGJlDJME1
@andthekisses Would u mind sending me what u have seen that confirms? I'd appreciate it xo
@andthekisses Oh I havnt seen anything like that yet-i'll look it up-thanks 4 sharing/correcting me. I don't condone anything other than peaceful protest!
Proud of the #WomensMarch for staying peaceful today which is always the goal. Angry &amp; violent protestors accomplish nothing.
@hansg2014 Agreed. I believe we can do both. Help our own, &amp; STILL be the country that stands tall to help all humans in ways we can. Not either or.

@DrHypose perhaps they were doing the best headlines with the science they had at the time. Science has changed remarkably n the last 20 yrs
@Slimybug87 differing viewpoints on how to get the results is always welcome. this is very different.
@Slimybug87 my kids better people, but i wouldn't hire one who has the intent of destroying my kids.
@Slimybug87 i agree-we should always play devils advocate. So id agree w/say, hiring a bbsitter who has a different view on how to make 1/2

@brdofthesmmr @freedom_gun and I DO care for u, her and anyone else who is marginalized. When they go low(and they have), we must go high.
@brdofthesmmr @freedom_gun I appreciate ur explanation and I will stand for you, for her, and for everyone marginalized.
@time4myopinion not friends. But we MUST stand tall. And demand better treatment. Together. And peacefully. I'm with u.
@pablofriendship u realize #imwithher right? I just don't want any bloodshed over this. "Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that"
The hate tweets Im getting based on trying 2 promote unity inspite of division is a perfect example of how his hate has already affected us🙁
........... https://t.co/FJ54r99hPI
@freedom_gun I agree, I'm just confused as to why u are so angry with me about it. We are on the same team.
@freedom_gun oh I do-But Im choosing to put power back in my hands, heart &amp;mouth since its r only choice now. Wish u could understand that
@freedom_gun no thanks, I'll continue talking about what I believe in and I'm not intimidated by bully's like u, toots.
@fromthesunlight @freedom_gun @icecrmsocialist Becaue we ARE all human and I'm going to be kind and demand decency. Hate does not cure hate.
@freedom_gun no it's very much still on the air. Sad to know you are ready to be so mean and divisive- just like them.

@deplorablejamee I dont have to vote anything. I choose the policies I belive will help people. Don't pretend u know things abt me u dont.
@deplorablejamee @teddyballgame98 violence &amp; intolerance is not acceptable from either side. Constructive convo &amp; respectful interaction is
@deplorablejamee  um, no when u get blocked it means someone doesn't enjoy interacting w/u. Says alot more abt u than them.
@simonhedlin @oohcooper damn straight!
@Duende1952 I agree. At this point everyone needs to look in the mirror because we are all becoming philistines.
@oohcooper @simonhedlin sure. Which is why we must always learn, grow, and walk in others shoes. And demand decency.
@oohcooper @simonhedlin if someone where screaming profanities at ur granmda-Would u stand idly &amp;let them continue b/c of thier free speech?
@oohcooper @simonhedlin @NYTnickc no. Decency and kindness does.
@Bryan_Mills_  if my only value in ur eyes is the way I look, u can save ur breath. I dont enjoy conversing w/chauvinists. Its  exhausting.
@Bryan_Mills_ @teddyballgame98 violence from either "side" is intolerable. We are not beasts.
@teddyballgame98 it's cute how calling people names makes small men feel powerful. Be well. -the little princess
@oohcooper @NYTnickc couldnt agree more. I'd fight for anyone's right to speak. I WON'T fight for someone's right to bully or abuse people.
@nowhitenonsense true, we made, &amp; keep making, a ton of mistakes. But going backwards wont help anything. We must strive for love for all.

@PatrickDBarnes "may be pertinent" but also said he "did not know if the info was significant". All blown out of proportion. Get facts.
@PatrickDBarnes democracy should win- but so should intelligent choices. It's about picking the candidate who is equipped to do the best job
@PatrickDBarnes no candidate is perfect.  https://t.co/NaJ6WrLcgP
@PatrickDBarnes the "cloud of corruption" has been inflated &amp;every  move she's made, even the cunning ones, have been thoroughly explained
@EdwinJanack nope. Just Calling out a racist when I see one.
@PatrickDBarnes the investigation is NOT being reopened, and sorry, I don't think jill stein is as strong a choice as hillary.
@lacey_hall07 where on earth are u getting that info? Trump was on tape. Show me proof hillary did that.

@namayajr15 I would say look deeper into hillary. Beyond headlines. She HAS proven herself to be a exemplary candidate.
@MySciFiFantasy but it HAS to be the woman's decision, NOT the governments.
@MySciFiFantasy of course, but we cannot assume we know the struggles others have. Noone is excited about making that hard decision.
@jessieaton @daxshepard1 no need to imagine it girl: https://t.co/Rhu1NKCH89
@namayajr15 if u do not vote for her, it's a vote for trump. Just want to make sure u understand that.

@kheadman Ah-greed. Distance and perceived differences create apathy. Even subconsciously. We have to outsmart it.
@missmeliss465 to ACTUALLY start caring about ones we haven't met. thats incredibly powerful.
@missmeliss465 in this case when the platform is used 2tell stories of ppl from arnd the world it can do nothing but bring us closer tgthr.
@missmeliss465 it stinks when ppl lie- but id rather give and taken advantage of than never give at all.
@missmeliss465 i think the cause of apathy is distance. creating an environment where u see suffering 1st hand would move u 2 action quicker

come to think of it, i did press "pool" but i thought it was a fun summer reference. like how @google changes fonts to celebrate holidays.
Didn't know @uber had a carpool option, but my driver just pulled over and said "gotta pick someone else up". this should be fun.

@ann_hauer Thank u as well. Always should be calm, and about safety and health, never anger xoxo
@ann_hauer I totally support preventative treatments for health :)
@ann_hauer and that's such a bummer :( but I believe (most) drs are doing the best they can but they aren't magic.
@ann_hauer wishes my children harm or is willing to gamble safety. I belive she reads studies constantly to find out how to keep kids SAFE.
@ann_hauer theres just no way that's true. Drs go into medicine 2 help people. Sure we all can get greedy but I dont belive my pediatrician
@ann_hauer if ur argument is true, then everyone-gov, drs &amp; everyone working for pharma has to be inherently evil &amp; wish harm to children.
@ann_hauer I respect all parents rights but i know how powerful fear can be-it can influence us to make emotional choices&amp;confuse fear&amp;fact.
@ann_hauer for the health of my kids I  researched BOTH sides for 3 weeks &amp; came out w/peer reviewed medical studies that proved vac safety.
@ann_hauer I shared factual information. it's terrifying to lead with fear and emotion instead of evidence.
@ann_hauer disagree completly. Ppl cam only choose 4 themselves when they have gathered factual information upon which to make thier choice.
@ann_hauer couldn't agree more. And I respect all decisions but do have strong opinions of my own based on evidence I've seen-just as u do.
@ann_hauer agreed but that's not the argument u made in ur first tweet. U said I was choosing for others. Which is not correct.
@ann_hauer that's called sharing, not making decisions for others.
@ann_hauer Noone should listen to anyone but the FACTS. The proven, medical facts. Free of opinion, free of money influences, free of fear.
@ann_hauer sad u interpret an op-ed as "making decisions for others". I chose to write abt MY journey &amp; what I learned. 2 very diff things.
well, I've changed my profile pic and I'm utterly satisfied.
@zmirich hahahaha I'm feeling very sassy today

@AbJules also maybe the limes were super cheap? We just don't know. (Admission: I also cook a lot with lemon and lime)
@AbJules im Just saying shes trying 2 walk in someone elses shoes &amp; ppl r being negative &amp; judgemental. It's just sad.
@AbJules maybe she has a recipe w/limes she luvs that fills her up? Who knows?
@AbJules you think she's out of touch because she likes and cooks with limes???? That's absurd.

@EddieSpegetti not sure where u got that fact-or how that’s even knowable- but FYI I donate both time and $ to charity often and happily.
@BobLarsenDuPage i do happily&amp;often. Just making the pnt that convincing lower/mid class 2 fight 4 tax breaks for the wealthy in unethical.

exactly. "@KingfishFilmCo  $100 to a blue collar person can affect their month. $10,000 to a millionaire wouldn't even be noticed."
@_LeifDanielle we've been sold a bill of goods to save them $ when lower/middle class can't find jobs OR pay their bills.
@_LeifDanielle i wish that were true but its just not. trust me I'm in this tax bracket and i see it up close.
@mistersideshow ok you're right, lets cut all the rich people a break until we kill the middle class once and for all. (this is sarcasm).

@HopeFloats019 $ stuff referencing that its kinder 2 have the # of kids u can afford,than not b able 2 feed em all. Every kid deserves that!
@HopeFloats019 no way! Family is the MOST important to me. But having less kids means more time for each-more love, more happiness.

@MG83693 children should be respected and cherished. Not spied on b/c of their parents choices, not yelled at b/c of them either. Period.
@MG83693 because scaring kids OR Spying on them is not ok either. It’s not news gathering- it’s plain old shady behavior.

@CaElWe @ETonlineAlert cameras used with respect? fine. chasing, endangering kids or this is not fine: http://t.co/mDE6PRupzd
@christinewines @ETonlineAlert its tricky and specific. the #pedorazzi has to "emotionally damage" the child to be in trouble(make em cry)
@nikhodges @ETonlineAlert bernie madoff is a jerk and shoulda known better but i don't wanna see his kids harassed
@nikhodges @ETonlineAlert should a child suffer or be put in danger b/c of the choices his parents made? no way.
@CaElWe @ETonlineAlert @EW @peoplemag if thought id win by targeting parent companies i wud-too big a battle, Im starting with the consumer.
@Jezziebel and i appreciate you for loving entertainment news, and being open to hearing this new perspective. @ETonlineAlert
@ShelleyHayhurst @ETonlineAlert sure will :(
@Rdesruisseau @ETonlineAlert EXACTLY!
@MikeMessina_ @ETonlineAlert @veronicamars i love you too. and it felt like coming home after being away at college for a decade.
@swiftiefan6 @ETonlineAlert one that I'm really excited to announce later today cuz its my fav blogger! the rest I'm working on!
@MensaJay3 if they make one i will!
@Kattressa @ETonlineAlert nope. if you are an actor, you are in the spotlight. i get that.
@PaulMurray95 i wish he could but i thin there are much bigger issues he focuses on-and i believe the consumer has the power to change this
@mots15 personally i wish i could dcuz i hate being followed all day but i truly believe its a losing battle.
@Kattressa @ETonlineAlert hmm id enlist maybe a child expert before my officially answer but off the top of my head id say 16 or 18
@jazzt @ETonlineAlert super crazy hard to wrap my head around- and also, awesome
@ShelleyHayhurst @ETonlineAlert VERY specifically it says a #pedorazzi could be in trouble if they "emotionally damage" the kid(make em cry)
@shana_audrey @ETonlineAlert YES I DO. razzi wouldn't exist if they weren't paid. BUT media will only change when the consumer demands it
@PaulMurray95 @ETonlineAlert i sure am. reminds me there are awesome people in the world :)
@RobertRG1 @ETonlineAlert yeppers
@Roy4114 @ETonlineAlert vote w/ur dollars. don't buy/consume publications who use pics of kids. the consumers have all the power!
@PaulMurray95 no and don't intent to. 1st amendment should say strong. but minors should dal so be protected. there is mid ground
@victoriaburke11 sure thing :)
@Lily_Mariie they run red lights-jump out of bushes-make kids cry-push and shove at schools &amp;parks. still confused Y its bugs me? ps luv u 2
@Roy4114 HECK YES!
@krypto909 @ETonlineAlert absolutely
@chrismclachlin @ETonlineAlert a powerful 1st amendment. which i love and what makes this nation great- but kids still need protection
@nxtom @ETonlineAlert NO! and isn't that absurd?? b/c what sure wore to the park is some how "news gathering". so tacky.
@Tristiano213 @ETonlineAlert flattered :)
@kimlauth21 id LOVE to but hard to convince a shareholder company not to carry something that SELLS. better to convince consumers not to buy
@madisonsagron i JUST married this cute dude in oct, so lemme see how this pans out
@Erudtoast @ETonlineAlert a combo of   both is best!
@Jezziebel @ETonlineAlert yes i have had guys yell and push and chase us and run red lights. every action endangered both my child &amp; others
@princessgleek nope. i sure wish we did.
@kwannon  remind them the kid isn't fictional&amp;has feelings. And that the #pedorazzi are hurtful &amp; endanger the kids. hopefully that'll help
@originalstatia @ETonlineAlert also, Absoluetly. mooah
@originalstatia @ETonlineAlert im not attempting to criticize parent who share photos. my goal is to protect the ones who DONT want to share
@kimlauth21 both. im SO PROUD @ETonlineAlert @TheInsider are so passionate about protecting the kids. entertainment journalism integrity
@kimlauth21 Absolutely and i am grateful the entertainers have the leverage of denying interviews. it means we will see faster results.
@eevbee agreed all kids! thats why the news never releases the name of child involved in a crime- the rule already exists 4 non celebs kids
@karennerak25 not really. theyre a business and i don't fault a business 4 weighing its options. ill only lose respect if they DONT change.
@christinewines @ETonlineAlert Never. 1st amendment is powerful- and also necessary- but it wud be great if it were illegal 2b an asshole.
@BackpackingDad no. in fact- doesn't it make us all WAY cooler that we aren't complacent w/the commodification of kids? i think so.
@Roy4114 @ETonlineAlert i believe the consumers have all the power. If we say NO we draw the line at harassing children- outlets will listen
@BlerhRador @ETonlineAlert Vote with your dollars. don't buy publications who use #pedorazzi photos. stop the money, stop the practice.
@condiva09 the shock is how the content has devolved into an unsafe and terribly hurtful practice. its not Fun- what ent new should be-
@condiva09 its not shocking we are on display. its shocking HUGE outlets pay razzi to spy, harass and endanger people for content.
@condiva09  if ur desire is 2 consume people-&amp; KIDS -as if they weren't human &amp;didn't have feelings, not sure how u sleep at nite
@condiva09 b/c someone wants to be a performer doesn't mean they don't deserve privacy and respect. EVERYONE deserves those basic rights
@condiva09 i did not know i would be harassed - and my BABY would be harassed on the street when i chose to act for a living.
@condiva09 i believe NOONE especially a child-should suffer for someone else decisions. if U disagree, this is a pointless discussion.
@condiva09 @ETonlineAlert children should be sacred&amp;protected. what does it say abt us if we r complacent in the commodification of kids?
@condiva09 @ETonlineAlert Children did not choose to be in the public eye - and they should have to suffer because of their parents career.
@BigBob80 @ETonlineAlert the difference is there would be consent, and the child would always be in a safe environment away from #pedorazzi
@BigBob80 @ETonlineAlert if parents wanna take pics of their kids &amp; share them wilingly- of course outlets should be free to post those too
Doing a Twitter Q&amp;A with @ETonlineAlert at 12:30 pm PT to talk about paparazzi targeting kids. What questions do you have? #AskKristen
@ivvesthlm currently @ETonlineAlert and @ETAlert are the first to apply a policy, and @Insider already had one!
@ivvesthlm I'm currently compiling a list &amp; will tweet it out as outlets join. we have a few i hope to announce soon!
@kpalms88 I'm the worst! thanks for telling me i corrected it!
@IAmKDill hope we will have more outlets on board soon and you can follow the ones who have a #NoKidsPolicy and stilll get fun ent news :)
FTW: My dog isn't wearing any clothes today. Bitch is just sitting in my living room, #NudeAsALooseBoob
@stace_a_base @mrchrislowell done and done!! donated and thankful you ware walking for a cure :)
.@WetpaintTV wrote abt the #pedorazzi-wish theyd apply it to THIER site! #nokidspolicy RT if u agree @wetpaintmoms http://t.co/UHxrXTmab0
Very outside of the box I like it! “@Spidey_Ant: "Honey, what's for dinner? The cupboards are #NudeAsALooseBoob!"”
@wailuku32 I used to as well! Then I saw first hand and said never again. Xo
Fashion, stripped down “@Grizzlysgrowls: #NudeAsALooseBoob is the new Black.”
Tomorrows outfit “@cam_dawg12:  nothing to wear? Lets just go #NudeAsALooseBoob”
@JStee haha ! Ps thanks for likening jokes, being thoughtful, and staying open to new opinions. You’re the best kind of people.
Well done! “@CamMParkes: My favourite way to sleep? Why, #NudeAsALooseBoob of course.”
#NudeAsALooseBoob - you’re welcome. Xo
@RichardCarrie_ @daxshepard1 #proudpervs
@RichardCarrie_ @daxshepard1 BINGO!
Tonight I asked @daxshepard1 if he’d help me popularize my new phrase: “Nude as a loose boob”. His reply? “Of course, Im your Huckleberry!”
@JStee couldn’t agree more. Lots of things are funny, some of them are hurtful. Lets laugh at the non-hurtful ones :)
@kibblesmith I love you Daniel. Thank u for all the giggles. #BellKibblesmith2016
@JStee @surisburnbook @alliehagan it means she isn’t fictional- she’s a child w/feelings &amp; it’s not cool to poke fun at a kid.
@BackpackingDad whoopsies…
@chrisannesam @anaserhall @shredidiah @GOPTeens @amysboyd hahahaha I cannot get enough
@KieYul believe me, I envied myself! What a babe!
Get ready for a particularly delicious #HouseofLies tonight! @IamDonCheadle #doncheadle #balls #doncheadlesballs http://t.co/gQgpAPlpkV
@littlelizziev the perfect recipie for a pick me up :) excited to see you in - few weeks! Xo
@mots15 having seen first hand what @pathpartners is accomplishing, I really appreciate everyone who supports them :) so thank u
@LeHangHo you sound awesome. Which means your mom did a great job. So i like her too. Hi Le-Hangs mom!
@anaserhall: @shredidiah @GOPTeens @amysboyd @chrisannesam #Teens: Is Obamacare The Hunger Games without a winner? (Yes)”  hahahaha omg
@shredidiah @GOPTeens @amysboyd @chrisannesam go to the website. It’s the most fabulous joke in the history of the world.
@shredidiah “@GOPTeens: #Teens: Who are some of your favorite #Conservative #celebs?”
@samsneadnaptown oh you think @Tip is the lucky one?
@1065KIIS @daxshepard1 lemme get some tongue!!!!
@tanner_ala @shredidiah @amysboyd @chrisannesam omg omg omg omg this is either horrific OR the best joke ever to have been made.
@M_C_777 @TheEllenShow or we could all be a bit more respectful to children.
@TheJacobMerritt and with anyone who can quote dumb and dumber the odds of hitting some of the bases with me will go up exponential ally!
@shredidiah @GOPTeens @amysboyd @chrisannesam omg is it real or the best joke ever?
.@daxshepard1 thank YOU @TheEllenShow for always having such fun, radical and quality entertainment. Being kind rules.
I want a fan 2b my date to the #VeronicaMarsMovie premier. We might not get frisky but we will have fun! Heres how:  http://t.co/BKZcjIMhxj
this is one of the most impressive things I've seen. Also, everyone who has ever sung anything has been recast. http://t.co/a3svvS2pDy
i highly doubt any grandmothers sleep on their stomach. it just doesn't seem like a very grandma thing to do.
@hopekrem i appreciate the choices ur making! we can all vote with our dollars and i KNOW @peoplemag will hear us and change their policy!
@dhardison hahahahahahahaah holy schnickies!
@Blue_eyedRebel then you are just a rockstar. xoxoxo
@SBjrkholm @daxshepard1 i disagree- i bet you are someone special :)
I volunteer as tribute.
@authenticpaint @ETonlineAlert @Pink @daxshepard1 i cared just didn't know how bad it actually was. walking in the shoes, ya know?
@rugz19 (hipthrust) xo
@redheadedwitch @daxshepard1 it was either that or carry some pepper spray! xo
.@BradBessey is a dream boat, a stellar human, and the exec producer of @TheInsider - who ALREADY had a #nokidspolicy http://t.co/lMOro49kJn
At @ETonlineAlert tonight who has joined the fight against #pedorazzi w/a #NoKidsPolicy.!! Thank u @NancyODell! http://t.co/DVOXUmGOeV
@TheInsider @daxshepard1 #theinsiderrules
THANK YOU to @TheInsider for having a #NoKidsPolicy! A message from exec prod @bradbessey http://t.co/rIrQzFi0Tp #Insider #ResponsibleMedia
@lkdanielle I saw the background pic on your page and immediately knew I liked you :)
@nikamgill 8 thousand!
@mrchrislowell thoughts? http://t.co/GbhzwyNLcm
@MichaelAusiello in retrospect you are the only one id leave out of that tweet- because you are ALWAYS in top form :)
Heaven is real, you guys. http://t.co/pR2DzckhkK
Lets be better and kinder than we were yesterday.
@dirtybo0ts oh how cool! We're honored to be on your wall :)
@BitingPanda I also love people who fully think issues through and play devils advocate. My compliments xo
@T2hays perhaps I didn't yet have a "platform" that reached ur ears. But don't try &amp; accuse me of having wishy washy values cuz youll lose.
@T2hays my outrage against an unsafe environments for kids and unhealthy media has always existed. Not my fault ur only now noticing.
@BitingPanda  the latter one for sure affects the child negatively- the former could be argued whether or not it's does.
@BitingPanda a pic of ur kid from ur living room where the child is happy and safe -and being followed by aggressive men w/cameras 1/2
@BitingPanda I wouldn't choose to post pics of my kid, but I don't fault those who do. There's a major difference btwn taking(&amp;posting) 1/2
@olemiss549 thank u for saying that I honestly need the support- this is a battle with a lot of backlash!
@ThatOneWIGuy agreed, but it's so tricky- and the power of amendment #1 is part of what makes this country so great. But ppl take advantage.
@element75 a weeks hard earned cashola?!? Good god girl you have some good karma comin! @pathpartners is amazing and we thank u!!
@bcarvalhobc you bet I would :) I hope you had a wonderful honeymoon!!! Xo
In other news worth covering- the walking bunghole who appeared on my tv last night has quite the grip on that leaf! http://t.co/lT4B5tfxnK
@oneofthosefaces @eddi86 "Pedo"-in relation to children-"razzi" -a photographer. no disrespect meant anywhere else-but the term is correct.
@oneofthosefaces @eddi86 no ones saying its not. EVERY problem affecting kids is worth standing up for. no matter what world it comes from.
@mrchrislowell #iadoreyou #justskimyourtweets #youredoinggreat #surfergirlpostersforeveryone
@ThatOneWIGuy 1st amendment rights r too powerful. Which, btw, they SHOULD be. But that doesnt mean we flush r integrity down the toilet.
Sad but true “@Kymi917: what's sad is NONE of the media is covering ur mission but quick 2 cover nonsense! I have stopped supporting them!”
@princessgleek just let em know the pic they see means a CHILD was followed by strange aggressive men w/cameras. Its all abt being informed.
@jbjammin34 @eonline @ENews no way. The consumer has way more power than the government. Consumers are a force to be wreckened with.
@dub_ya_bee red carpet photo co's don't discern who they sell pics to-but I CAN stop doin interviews 4 co's who don't have a #NoKidsPolicy
@ThatOneWIGuy @J_Stell17 uphill battle worth fighting. #NoKidsPolicy #pedorazzi
DONE! “@DowntownJRBrown: You could refuse to promote your films and grant interviews to these companies. That would have the most pull.”
BINGO!!!!!“@J_Stell17: we do have the power, it's just getting everyone to work together!”
@AnnieKay21 @eonline @ENews I appreciate you. As a mom, and as a fellow entertainment consumer. Xo
“@CandyFairy16: I feel that @ENews is the classiest tho. They tend to not invade privacy or spread lies bout ppl” - I thought so too :(
Id love to see the day when CONSUMERS have the power to get @eonline/@ENews to create a #nokidspolicy &amp; stop siding w/#pedorazzi
this gave me goosies. http://t.co/WoPdHQnkeQ #DisneyFrozen
@chelseychatt @veronicamars @lancechatt i hope you guys win. we would obviously have a blast. you ARE awesome. xo
@Bex3713 thank you! i am SO excited. i have so much fun working with those idiots.
Someone just said "hashtag" in a conversation. Volunteers for their eulogy?
hee hee "@Sydney_Clark13 I bet Hans wasn't even going to say sandwiches. You know what rhymes with Hans? Asshole."
@Sydney_Clark13 hahahahah this is the funniest tweet I've read in a while :)
@christigrotts whoo! You gotta have sharp skills to keep an eye on that! Xo
@worldchmps @rejectedjokes no the extras are miming!
@SienaEyrich @RobThomas that looks fab!!!!
The best idea ever “@Mr_Miyagi_09: To promote #HouseOfLies, you should have lied about tweeting during tonight's show. Woulda been genius”
i wasn't on set when they shot this fight- that shot was done the day after #HouseOfLies
hahahahahah #HouseOfLies
.@RyanFGaul is hilarious #HouseOfLies
that was vegetable soup #HouseOfLies
#mekhiphifer is BRINGING it on the show this year. #HouseOfLies
when you do shots in a scene you pee often b/c you're drinking so much water. #HouseOfLies
.@tip is a fabulous actor and great to work with. so lucky to have him on the show this year. #HouseOfLies
whoopsiessss...#sorrymarty #HouseOfLies
besides all the gorgeous extras and the motorcycle, there was also a snake in the club scene. #HouseOfLies
i love @IamDonCheadle theres no two ways about it. #HouseOfLies
A visual: marty kaan has eggs in a basket. #HouseOfLies
its awkward to shoot club scenes cuz its always silent and we have to yell then they lay the music in later. #HouseOfLies @rejectedjokes
dougs nightmare is similar to kristens nightmare. i really like my dogs, but i also have a lot of chocolate in the house. #HouseOfLies
hahahaha @joshlaw81 reaction to the cigarette #HouseOfLies
.@joshlaw81 defense of @rejectedjokes is so romantic. #HouseOfLies
i wish i could wear my hair like that everyday. #HouseOfLies
the costumer made @joshlaw81 's suit from some old curtains on set. #HouseOfLies
the chocolates bit: i do things like this to @joshlaw81 in real life and i love it. #HouseOfLies
another fact- @Movieve is a gem both on screen and off #houseoflies
Im way more impressed with sneakers than Jeannie is. #HouseOfLies
.@tip just said #neuticles #HouseOfLies
man I'm even a potty mouth in the trailer. #HouseOfLies
