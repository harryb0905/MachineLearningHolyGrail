...campy or clever I can't tell. The Rockettes better show up so I don't have to be dragged to the Spectacular this year.
Now there is some skit going on about a dad wo a camera to take care of his kid at a recital. Hmmm
S4 has 13 mp camera, 2g ram, 5 inch screen, 7mm thin. All avail end of april
136mm long, 5 inch screen, 7mm thin
Revise air *view* is the touchless interface.
samsung S4 to launch at once with 327 carriers in 150 countries at end of April.
