@shameless_sin71 Thank you for love:).  I don't understand (at all) why disagreeing on methodology is falsely simplified to disagreeing with message?!  I 100% feel same way about policies, but have different ideas on how to affect change.
@Cupcakes_n_Rap I would not reduce the civil rights movement or that of LGBTQ to individuals approaching people on streets to scream.  Both were HIGHLY organized and intentional.

@58alexandrite @TheView @JoyVBehar Actually, we were all laughing so hard:). I was joking with the face because it wasn't literally true, but my husband won that round with his comeback.
@gpg152 @TheView I am not saying Trump doesn't understand racism in general (clearly he has shown otherwise), but rather speaking specifically to tweets.
@cocoaspyce It's not even playing devil's advocate.  I think not getting the distinction...or understanding, but not caring is worse.
@dcbarnett77 @TheView @hm I agree...but a shirt saying "feminist" is a very different thing.
@s_wade @iamsambee I said it went too far.  I see what she was trying to do with joke, but her choice of word is what killed the joke for me...but comedy is subjective.
@RealPaulaCain @paulafaris Which is EXACTLY what I was saying.
@NewCentorions @FansofABG @paulafaris I think it is JUST as bad if he can't distinguish between racist behavior and dissenting opinion or profanity.  But he absolutely doesn't care either way.

@countrytrumpkin @TheView There is a difference between disagreement (which I welcome if it is productive language/thought) and trolling. I don't want people in my life who put out that energy and I won't have it on my social media either.  Life is too short!

@Cassandra16123 @MaleyBetty I am here to share my opinion.  This is a show about different "Views".
@MaleyBetty Um, I didn't vote for Trump?  Not sure if you misheard the point.  I don't approve of any of this behavior.  Our foreign policy right now, however, is MUCH scarier to me than his affairs/dalliances.
@PeterGazzara @CBSThisMorning No no no!  To repeatedly be surprised or dwell on the moral shortcomings of the President doesn't move ball forward. I want to hear about our plans in Syria, how we will handle Russia and North Korea, etc.

@OliverBStyles @sunny @happysquirel75 @OliverBStyles THAT part was just stupidity.  A moment where you hear your own words and say - huh?  On its very face I don't think it could be that...but I never learned much about her. I just watched series John Adams and there were references to Jefferson &amp; Hemings.
@2BGMEDIA @Bionicscode @JoyVBehar @TheView I am "liking" the idea of someone who sees a teaching moment.  I admitted that I had it wrong and am going to read in on it.  Teaching moments move things forward.  Excortiating people beyond that acknowledgement is not helping anything/anyone.
@sunny @happysquirel75 Thank you @sunny!!  You know I will... xoxo
@ReneeRevelation @TheView Thank you for tweeting.  I recently read a collection of Adams' love letters to Abigail and it had some of Jefferson's too.  I absolutely see the problem in seeing it from his perspective and not hers.  My fault completely.
@happysquirel75 @sunny I was not aware of the entirety of the story and @sunny did school me about the facts. I am now deep diving to learn more.
Thanks for your tweets today. My comment about Jefferson and Hemings‚Äô affair show the problem with historically only hearing one side of a story. I was referring to love letters, but I understand that there‚Äôs SO MUCH MORE to it.

@kjayj6 @sunny @MeghanMcCain Is it possible to support the cause without supporting the person?  I applaud money and resources being directed to online bullying.  It's less the spokesperson and more the issue.
@adamchristian @sunny I understand why it would seem that way, but in my time at the show, we haven't done that to a child or relative who wasn't politically more involved.

@adamchristian @sunny Chelsea inserted herself politically by speaking on her mom's behalf along the campaign trail and at the convention.  This was a different situation.
@adamchristian @sunny She came on to discuss a children's book...but if her father visited üòâ, we could talk politics.
@adamchristian @sunny Take a minute and think why that may be...exactly!
@HippieAdventure @catitcomb @POTUS What cause could she take on that he doesn't undo?  I'm genuinely asking...
@catitcomb @POTUS With what he does (and doesn't do), what is left for her to do??  If I pick my battles, this is one I'll give to her and a good cause.
@maysoonzayid @MeghanMcCain I would NEVER marry a man like that in the first place, but considering her situation, I'd love to see her do something good while she is there.
@nessagale03 @MeghanMcCain @TheView Why is it giving HIM a pass?  I can disagree on so much of what Melanie does, but this is a campaign for kids...why is it being twisted to stand for everything she has ever done??
@Sunflower7of9 @TheView @MeghanMcCain I'm sorry, I have NO IDEA what you are referring to...??
@kjayj6 @sunny @MeghanMcCain I do not support what she has done, or agree with her on much, but if she wants to put some good into the world and fight anti bullying, I say go for it!
@adamchristian @sunny Why would an interview about a children's book be any different?  Unless she jumps in political ring, I wouldn't hold her responsible for her father's politics.

@HausOfEndy @TheView Have you watched our show?  We talk about Trump CONSTANTLY...and always reference the never ending campaigning.
@dtheavenger @JoyVBehar @HillaryClinton I did not say "go away".  It is my "View", looking toward 2020, that I want suggestions/ideas/solutions for all of these problems going forward.
@LiberalPhenom Yes!!!  And I constantly say the same thing about it when he does it.
@AntoineDWright @TheView @MeghanMcCain I agree regarding strategy.  Identifying problem is key, but as one of the most influential and experienced dem. voices, I want to hear that channeled into solutions for 2020. We don't want a rerun of 2016.
@TashWithLove Trust me - I am!!!
@dtheavenger @JoyVBehar @HillaryClinton Not sure where the "shut up" came from...because that wasn't what any of us said.  Hillary has so much knowledge on the issues that I said she should be helping the party move forward.
@ksugrad1995 @TheView Race absolutely played a part in the election, but to just get angry and keep talking about it doesn't move the needle toward fixing anything.

Journalism will long outlive this President. If the news media compromises its standards to counterpunch in Trump's war against them, it feeds a mistrust that could take years to rebuild. https://t.co/dA6hqodK5L

@JENisJUICY Feel free to argue necessity of the button.  My point was reporters shouldn't take liberties (I.e. the button was specially put in for him) with these stories.  Give victims a voice - yes, but don't let your journalistic integrity drop to color the story.
@CeraMC Of course not.  But reporting that it was specially put in for him is untrue.  We need to hear from anyone who has been violated, but the reporting needs to be accurate and held to the standard of any other story/article.
@realBKW @TheView Exactly!  That's my point in SOME of the reporting.  Doesn't make sense does it?

The mob mentality in court of public opinion these days is quick to fire everyone &amp; want their lives ruined. I think punishment should always fit crime. No one gets a pass w/this behavior, but what happens as result should be decided based on each case. https://t.co/pNzSVOsjAH
Scrutiny, yes...but these accusations/offenses do cover a spectrum. Irresponsible to say they all deserve same punishment.  All are inappropriate, but some are more abhorrent then others &amp; pedophilia (Roy Moore/Kevin Spacey) is whole diff. category. https://t.co/3z7A8u5Zwq

@TangelaWCraft @TheView Thank you for tweeting. It is only through others' experiences and daily realities that I can keep growing and understanding better.
@pnutmomma @TheView If you watched the clip, you would see that I specifically (and clearly) stated there is no comparison.
@TangelaWCraft @TheView Ah, ok. Just wanted to be clear that I TOTALLY support the kneeling. Thanks for clarifying.
@TangelaWCraft @TheView I FULLY support the kneeling and I have said that repeatedly on the show.  That wasn't the convo. we had today.
@pnutmomma @TheView I appreciate feedback.  I just don't think shutting people down helps anyone moving forward. If I don't understand, I ask more questions.
@pnutmomma @TheView I'd like to make sure the entire conversation was watched and merely clarifying the definition we were working with...
@HocusPocusNoir @pnutmomma @TheView But I actually support the protesting. My example was a ref. to any conversations on race...which is being proven by some of these tweets.
@pnutmomma @TheView Based on def of being treated unjustly due to race, sex, or age, it is discrimination. Was specifically referencing stat we were discussing.
@Cwills3809 @TheView Wow! A bit harsh. Explained, in ref. to stat., that only example I had (aside from sexual dis.) involved being shut down because I'm white.
@pnutmomma @TheView Was there anything specific you are referring to? Today was merely about being shut down before being heard.
@ksugrad1995 @TheView I was using basic def. of being treated unjustly due to race, age, or sex. And it is NOT equal to the level you reference (of course)!
@TangelaWCraft @TheView The disagreements aren't from table, because I've supported protests we've spoken about on air. My input is usually re: strategy/messaging.
Fox/MSN have always leaned right/left. CNN was (4 most part) down mid. As fan/avid viewer, I rely on that measured reporting-especially now. https://t.co/hNi5Uc4bbz

@workinmama @brijh @LizzieWithA_Z These aren't mutually exclusive. He is awful! But she (&amp; dems) can't fix the problems in party &amp; messaging if we don't know what prob is.
@workinmama @brijh @LizzieWithA_Z I agree she was best candidate (BY FAR), &amp; wud vote 4 her again. But think she needs to help party really lock into what went wrong.

@workinmama @brijh @LizzieWithA_Z I don't think that AT all. I'm worried if dems/liberals don't properly &amp; entirely understand what we missed this round, we will lose again.
