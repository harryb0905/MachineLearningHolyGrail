The effort to end the #FakeEmergency is not about partisanship — it is about patriotism. Every Member of Congress swears an oath to protect &amp; defend the Constitution. We must not abandon that responsibility now.
It’s time for the House to act on the oath we all swore to protect and defend the Constitution. #FakeEmergency https://t.co/GypPJkqjYD
At 5:00 pm ET, Members of the House will come together to discuss legislation to protect the separation of powers as laid out in the Constitution and terminate Trump’s #FakeEmergency.   Tune in here: https://t.co/KomvJFOWyZ https://t.co/OeDC0Bkf0V
As the only public defender in California elected by the people, Jeff Adachi was a tireless advocate for justice and equality. May it be a comfort to his wife, Matsuko, and daughter, Lauren, that so many in our Bay Area community mourn with them today. https://t.co/LV7hNVG0aD

Members of Congress all swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution. On Tuesday, the House will vote on @JoaquinCastrotx’s legislation to defend the separation of powers following @realDonaldTrump’s decision to ignore the bounds of the law with his emergency declaration.
Wishing a happy birthday to @repjohnlewis. Thank you for all that you continue to do to effect change in America &amp; inspire others to join the fight for a better future! https://t.co/Q1GwTLyFZ4
Our Founders designed a government made up of three co-equal branches. @realDonaldTrump cannot go outside the bounds of the law after he failed to convince the Congress and the American people to pay for his wall. https://t.co/XtvtNc20Ao

Clearest sign that @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeTrumpEmergency is not legitimate? The President himself says he didn’t need to declare a national emergency – it’s just a faster way to force taxpayers to foot the bill after Congress wouldn’t let him have his way. https://t.co/igvnNk128J
.@SenSchumer &amp; I call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution. Read our full join statement here: https://t.co/UZx47ghlQE
.@realDonaldTrump is not above the law. The Congress cannot let the President shred the Constitution.
.@realDonaldTrump’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our Founders’ vision.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.
This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process.
.@realDonaldTrump’s unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation.
Democrats are sending legislation to the President’s desk to #KeepGovernmentOpen. https://t.co/vRQsjG0GZg
No child should be denied a loving home because the family that wishes to adopt them is LGBTQ or a religious minority. The Trump Admin must deny states’ unconstitutional waiver requests &amp; make sure child welfare stays at the heart of our state child welfare systems.
I applaud @RepSeanMaloney, @RepAngieCraig &amp; @RepKatieHill for leading the charge against the blatantly unconstitutional attempt to allow the GOP’s anti-LGBTQ, anti-Semitic &amp; anti-Muslim bigotry to take root in our foster &amp; adoption systems. https://t.co/eXCY5tYJyE
A year after America’s heart was broken by the horrific act of brutality &amp; violence in Parkland that stole 17 precious lives, we continue to be inspired by the persistence &amp; courage of the survivors and families who have turned their pain into action. #MSDStrong https://t.co/LyEitnLNGU
The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.
.@realDonaldTrump couldn’t convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he’s trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it.
It is yet another demonstration of @realDonaldTrump’s naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the President’s fearmongering doesn’t make it one.
Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that @realDonaldTrump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall.

It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of @RepWalterJones — a gentleman who treated his colleagues on both sides of the aisle with kindness, decency and compassion. May it bring comfort to his family that so many grieve with &amp; pray for them at this time.
Frank Robinson’s impact was felt long after he retired his glove to make history &amp; become the first African American manager for both my hometown teams, @SFGiants &amp; @Orioles. His leadership on and off the field will be remembered for years to come.

Chairman @JohnDingell had a hand in crafting many major legislative accomplishments over the past half-century – but few hold greater meaning than his tireless commitment to the health of the American people. His memory will stand as an inspiration to all Americans. https://t.co/SYQlKQwXrJ
We hope it is a comfort to Chairman Dingell’s beloved wife, @RepDebDingell, and their entire family that so many mourn their loss and pray for them at this sad time.
America has lost a beloved pillar of the Congress &amp; one of the greatest legislators in our history. @JohnDingell’s entire life was lived in service to our country. His leadership played an important role in the passage of both #Medicare and the #ACA. https://t.co/1nt6YqB0oe

What does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump, politically, personally or financially?
.@realDonaldTrump’s continued efforts to undermine Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation raises the questions:
Roger Stone’s indictment makes clear there was a deliberate, coordinated effort by top Trump campaign officials to subvert the will of the American people during the 2016 Election. #FollowTheFacts

What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.
What is original in the President’s proposal is not good. What is good in the proposal is not original. Democrats will vote next week to add additional border security funding for ports of entry, advanced technology for scanning vehicles for drugs &amp; immigration judges.
Democrats were hopeful that @realDonaldTrump was finally willing to re-open government &amp; proceed with a much-needed discussion to protect the border. Unfortunately, reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of previously rejected initiatives. https://t.co/MFwebWSevG https://t.co/yMTm4iP27h

Taking pride in shutting down the government — taking pride in threatening to do so for months or years — is not the behavior of a responsible president. #TrumpShutdown #EndTheShutdown
When Democrats took the majority, we promised to listen to good ideas, wherever &amp; whomever they came from. That’s why we voted to pass the GOP language to re-open government that the Senate already passed. But they still they refuse to take "yes" for an answer. #EndTheShutdown

On Day One of the new Congress, the House passed bipartisan legislation that honors our responsibility to protect the American people with funding for smart, effective border security solutions – @realDonaldTrump’s wasteful and ineffective wall.
Now that the television networks have decided to air @realDonaldTrump’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime.
Instead, @realDonaldTrump is still demanding that American taxpayers pay at least $5.7 billion for his wall, which can’t pass either chamber of Congress &amp; of course Mexico is not paying for.
Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump keeps rejecting the bipartisan House-passed bills, which have already received strong bipartisan support in the Senate, to re-open the government.
Democrats &amp; an increasing number of Republicans in Congress have repeatedly urged @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr to end the #TrumpShutdown and re-open the government while Congress debates the President’s expensive and ineffective wall.
The facts are clear: @realDonaldTrump has the power to stop hurting the country by re-opening the government and ending the #TrumpShutdown.  Read my full statement w/ @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/ZpPrRAsIhf

My message to women seeking to lead our nation? Don’t worry about the hang ups of the nay-sayers. Know what you’re fighting for &amp; why you are fighting for it. Know your power. #MSNBCTownHall https://t.co/5Dv2paX91m
The American people should be able to expect transparency &amp; openness from their Congress – and that’s exactly what we’re going to give them. #MSNBCTownHall https://t.co/hSDkoql1pr
Next week, @HouseDemocrats will begin passing individual appropriations bills to re-open all government agencies, starting with the Department of the Treasury &amp; IRS – an action necessary to make sure working families receive their tax refunds on schedule. #TrumpShutdown
While @realDonaldTrump threatens to continue the #TrumpShutdown for “years,” Democrats are taking further action to re-open government in order to meet Americans’ needs, protect our borders &amp; respect our workers. https://t.co/xo55gDKy3y https://t.co/0tGVojLCRP
The Russia investigation is immensely important – but if we let it distract us from the way Trump Admin policies are hurting American on a daily basis, we are doing a disservice to our responsibilities as a Congress. #MSNBCTownHall https://t.co/K3RSlssVjK
Our Founders envisioned three co-equal branches of government. There’s little excuse for one chamber of Congress refusing to do its job and simply giving power over to the President. #MSNBCTownHall https://t.co/Orxvrpy25c
It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to accept “yes” as an answer. Let us do our jobs. Let us reopen government. #TrumpShutdown #MSNBCTownHall
Americans deserve to know: the government funding package passed by the House yesterday is the *exact same* plan passed by the @SenateGOP just weeks ago. And yet, now, they refuse to vote on it. #MSNBCTownHall
Just a few more hours until my conversation with @JoyAnnReid airs at 10 pm ET! #MSNBCTownHall https://t.co/hiwSiv8e30
Always a pleasure to chat with @JoyAnnReid – and such a treat to have it happen at my alma mater, @TrinityDC. Be sure to watch tonight at 10 pm ET! #MSNBCTownHall https://t.co/H0tt0nP6tq
By passing H.R. 1, the #ForThePeople Act, we can ensure that the people’s interests — not special interests — are the focus of this Democratic House. https://t.co/lBFLUYMOEJ
.@HouseDemocrats are keeping our promise to the American people &amp; unveiling #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, a historic reform package to restore the promise of our democracy, end Washington’s culture of corruption, &amp; reduce the role of money in our politics. https://t.co/vBMx8bQb1T
America delivered a new House Majority w/ a stern message for Washington: Republicans’ attacks on health care must end.    @RepColinAllred &amp; our transformational freshmen are leading the charge to #ProtectOurCare and stop the GOP's assault on people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/c2xyfpqEC2
I have invited @realDonaldTrump to deliver his State of the Union address before a Joint Session Congress on Tuesday, January 29, 2019. https://t.co/TOMOaLBR37 https://t.co/viV8regxcf
Ensuring a bright future for our children &amp; grandchildren must be at the heart of all we do as a Congress. #ForThePeople https://t.co/pCcwXgaptu
Tune in as Members of Congress &amp; their families participate in our ceremonial swearing-in. https://t.co/rDcYDe9RfH
Tune in as Members of Congress &amp; their families participate in our ceremonial swearing-in. https://t.co/OURbZmgCCz
Guided by the vision and values of our Founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and the aspirations that we have for our children, let us meet that responsibility with courage, with wisdom and with grace. #ForThePeople
The middle class is the backbone of our democracy. It has been so since the birth of democracy itself. #ForThePeople
We have heard from too many families who wonder, in this time of innovation and globalization, if they have a place in the economy of the future. We must remove all doubt that they do, and say to them: we will have an economy that works for you. #ForThePeople
As the House of Representatives opens the 116th Congress today in Washington, it will hold the election for the 63rd Speaker of the House.  Watch live 👇  https://t.co/wYCvCXbnoN
During today’s meeting between @realDonaldTrump, myself &amp; other Democratic leaders, we asked the President to open up the government – giving him a path Republicans have supported previously. Why would he not do it? #TrumpShutdown
.@realDonaldTrump has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly &amp; quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown – just the first sign of things to come in our new Democratic Majority committed to working #ForThePeople. https://t.co/CGl1euCotB
Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/R0xRpL8c8W https://t.co/BRJv13FhOH
Once the Senate passes this legislation and puts us on a path to reopening government, the President must come to his senses and immediately sign it into law.
It would be the height of irresponsibility &amp; political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported.
The President is using the #TrumpShutdown to try to force an expensive &amp; ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown.
Our legislation reopens government services, ensures workers get the paychecks they’ve earned &amp; restores certainty to the lives of the American people.
While @realDonaldTrump drags the nation into #TrumpShutdown Week 2 and sits in the White House &amp; tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess.
Americans sent a clear message in November – they are tied of exactly the type of behavior that triggered the #TrumpShutdown. Congressman-elect Joe Neguse is working to start putting things right by passing the bold reforms in HR 1. https://t.co/ssSeLimXGl
It is with great enthusiasm that I appoint @USRepKCastor as the Chair of our new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. We know she will bring great experience, energy &amp; urgency to confronting this existential threat. https://t.co/PtKVsvvxXk https://t.co/Ow3ukDfTuS
The tragic death of an innocent child on Christmas Day breaks the hearts of all. Democrats call on Homeland Security’s Inspector General to immediately open an investigation into Felipe Alzono-Gomez’s death. https://t.co/on2E63hPhX https://t.co/pvNCtMJt9g
As families across the country come together to celebrate, we wish joy &amp; comfort to you all. Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays! https://t.co/cCL4AJ1lMs
As long as @realDonaldTrump is guided by the House @FreedomCaucus, it’s hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his #TrumpShutdown.
.@realDonaldTrump wanted the #TrumpShutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.
Meanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what @realDonaldTrump would accept or not accept to end his #TrumpShutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment.
Instead of bringing certainty into people’s lives, @realDonaldTrump is continuing the #TrumpShutdown just to please right-wing radio &amp; TV hosts.
It's Christmas Eve and @realDonaldTrump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve — after he just fired the Secretary of Defense. #TrumpShutdown
By choosing to trigger the #TrumpShutdown, @realDonaldTrump is hampering important efforts to keep Americans safe. If Trump &amp; the GOP don’t stop holding America hostage to their radical policies, the Democratic Majority will act swiftly to reopen government in January. https://t.co/Ii5F6bIjNL
If @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans choose to continue this #TrumpShutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January.
Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, &amp; all of which include funding for strong, sensible, &amp; effective border security – not the president's ineffective and expensive wall.
.@realDonaldTrump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a #TrumpShutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted.
Republicans control the House, the Senate, &amp; the White House. But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, @realDonaldTrump threw a temper tantrum &amp; convinced the @HouseGOP to push our nation into a destructive #TrumpShutdown during the holiday season.
Regrettably, America has now entered a #TrumpShutdown.
A #TrumpShutdown hurts the men &amp; women who keep us safe: taking away paychecks from 41,000 federal law enforcement &amp; corrections officers – plus nearly 90% of Homeland Security employees. https://t.co/dEho7pSSb7
Maybe @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP can’t imagine living paycheck to paycheck like most Americans. But the #TrumpShutdown will force nearly 800k federal employees to go without pay – right in the middle of the holidays.
It’s the holiday season. Trump and Republican antics are causing shockwaves through the economy. Working families need certainty. @realDonaldTrump needs to stop holding America hostage, and keep government open &amp; working for the people.
Food safety inspections will be curtailed. Identity theft victim services will be suspended. State and local law enforcement training programs will be stopped. All thanks to a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/aINYdkrtDI
.@realDonaldTrump’s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall doesn’t make us safe, or honor our oath to protect &amp; defend our neighbors &amp; communities. And no matter much how he thinks a #TrumpShutdown will help him politically, it poses a real threat to American families.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/MXvDX3Xz1u
Democrats are for real border security solutions. Not for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on an immoral, ineffective &amp; expensive wall.
We all take an oath to protect and defend our country. Border security is an important part of that oath. Your wall will fail in the Senate tomorrow, Mr. President. America cannot afford a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/8S7QJzAanT
All Americans should take time to read General Mattis’s letter of resignation. It is a truly beautiful letter that speaks to our very best values as a nation. https://t.co/XY0mvqfv9q
General Mattis was a comfort to many who were concerned about the path the Trump Admin would choose to take. His resignation letter is defined by statements of principle — principles that drove him to leave the Administration. All of us should be concerned at this time.
We should be working to help hungry Americans, not take away their food. Yet under a new rule proposed by the Trump Admin (based on ideas the Congress rejected on a bipartisan basis), hundreds of thousands of ppl could lose nutrition assistance. This is the definition of cruelty.
I’m speaking with reporters live from at Capitol. https://t.co/TVl2lId67B
I’ll be speaking with reporters at 10:45 am ET as Congress continues to work to keep government open #ForThePeople.  Tune in here: https://t.co/IW0705Xs0S
Democrats are committed to fully, responsibly funding the government in January. In the meantime, we will support the continuing resolution to keep government open &amp; working. #ForThePeople
The new Democratic Majority will take decisive action to protect students from gun violence &amp; keep schools free from discrimination. #NeverAgain https://t.co/S2928vd3oI
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @BetsyDeVosED have reached a new low. Their “report” on school safety puts special interests and the NRA ahead of protecting America’s school children. Students &amp; parents have had #Enough. It’s time for the GOP to stop ignoring them.
We won’t let the GOP’s cruel lawsuit stop Americans from getting affordable health care.  Remember: today is the deadline to sign up for health care during Open Enrollment! Head to https://t.co/PcWW0rWUVh to see how much money you can save &amp; #GetCovered before midnight.
Democrats will act quickly in the Majority to restore integrity to government and ensure Congress is working #ForThePeople, not the wealthy &amp; well-connected. Read more about our plans in this op-ed by @RepMGS &amp; @RepSarbanes: https://t.co/tZ7rzgNB2U
.@SecretaryZinke has been a shameless handmaiden for the special interests &amp; his staggering ethical abuses have dealt a lasting blow to America’s public lands &amp; resources. https://t.co/k00RwogOZ3
Humbled to have had the chance to visit the “Pelos-Tree” today — honoring our newly elected House Democratic women! Together, we can return a respect for our common humanity &amp; our environment to our country. You all inspire us each &amp; every day! #ForThePeople https://t.co/y1lN9YPJgY
Tonight’s absurd ruling exposes the monstrous endgame of the GOP’s all-out assault on people w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; the ACA. When @HouseDemocrats take the gavel, the House will swiftly intervene in the appeals process to #ProtectOurCare!
We must honor the spark of divinity in every person. We have a moral responsibility to ensure all children are treated with decency &amp; compassion. The new Congress will investigate this horrific tragedy to ensure the safety &amp; security of every child. https://t.co/zA3z5V0jf2
We have a moral responsibility to ensure all children are treated with decency and compassion. My heart goes out to the father &amp; family of Jakelin Caal, the young girl who died after being taken into custody by the Border Patrol.
The free &amp; open internet is at the heart of what drives the American economy, opening doors to education &amp; empowering small business. The @FCC must start listening to the voices of the American people &amp; stop standing in the way of #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/nd4jy2Po9E
.@RepRoybalAllard is tired of seeing Republicans &amp; @realDonaldTrump shut down government instead of working for the American people. Take a moment to listen to how Congress *should* be spending its time. https://t.co/lFqo2BvAld
Six years after 26 beautiful souls were murdered at #SandyHook, our hearts still break for the families of those lost. In the years since, we have been inspired by the strength they have shown as they have fought to ensure other families are spared the pain they’ve experienced.
It’s hard to have a serious conversation when @realDonaldTrump is intent on making the Oval Office an evidence-free zone. https://t.co/xFGJS10RU0
At a time when there is so much uncertainty about the economic security of working families, it is deeply disturbing that @realDonaldTrump is threatening a #TrumpShutdown. This is far from the treatment American families deserve during the holiday season.
I’m holding my weekly press conference here at the Capitol. https://t.co/6kPYBpp6JW
I will be holding my weekly press conference today at 10:45 am ET. I hope you will take a moment to tune in. https://t.co/0xwoP31SD3
Today, the House honored a decades-long tradition by passing a strong, bipartisan #FarmBill that strengthens the safety net for families and provides certainty for our farmers. https://t.co/akSbLTbAr1 https://t.co/8QKwt80X71
The energy we have seen from the many young organizers &amp; advocates committed to fighting for a cleaner future has been inspiring. In the months ahead, Democrats will ensure the voices of experts &amp; advocates are heard as we work to protect the beauty of God’s creation.
Three years after the signing of the #ParisAgreement, the Trump Admin’s refusal to confront the climate crisis demands that all Americans work together to ensure a healthier, safer &amp; more sustainable future for our families &amp; our communities.
.@realDonaldTrump has the Senate, the White House, and the House (for the moment) under Republican control. He has the power to keep government open – but instead, he says he’s going to shut down the government. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Pdbo4rH0sG
Our country cannot afford a #TrumpShutdown, especially at this time of economic uncertainty. This holiday season, @realDonaldTrump knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to pass the House &amp; Senate, and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan agreement.
Republicans still control the House, the Senate, and the White House, and they have the power to keep government open.
Wonderful to see the @warriors receive (well-earned) recognition as @SInow #Sportsperson of the Year. Your dazzling play on the court &amp; inspiring leadership in our communities leave us proud to count you as part of our Bay Area family. #DubNation https://t.co/dB8qAoMMk3
Thank you to @maxschachter for taking the time to visit with me yesterday. No family deserves to be subjected to the pain you &amp; your family have experienced in the wake of that dark day in Parkland, &amp; your work with @alexsafeschools to make sure they never have to is inspiring. https://t.co/4JOuOvHJdM
November’s #JobsReport shows an economy struggling to carry the weight of a GOP agenda which enriches the already-wealthy, while leaving working families with the bill. Now, more than ever, it is clear why Congress must work #ForThePeople. https://t.co/eFdpRK2AXv
As the new @CFPB Director, Kathy Kraninger has a duty to protect working families, vets, students &amp; seniors &amp; to restore accountability. Democrats will continue to fight to strengthen consumer protections that ensure families can succeed. https://t.co/w3UMW5mzfm

President George H.W. Bush’s belief in a “gentler, kinder” America was on my mind today as @SpeakerRyan &amp; I placed a wreath on behalf of the House next to his casket in the Rotunda.

The climate crisis threatens both our communities &amp; our economy. While @realDonaldTrump ignores his own admin’s report, House Dems are pushing for action w/ select committee on #ClimateChange. We can create millions of good-paying jobs w/ bold, green infrastructure investments!
I am thankful for the heroism of all of America’s military men and women, including our trans servicemembers—@realDonaldTrump’s attacks on these brave people in uniform are a disgrace. https://t.co/ovtUqhH0JA

.@realDonaldTrump continues to wage an all out campaign to undermine the Mueller investigation — including through the installation of Matthew Whitaker as Acting AG, viewed by bipartisan experts as a violation of the Constitution.
We will be opening the new Congress in the transparent &amp; open way we promised. Lowering prescription drug prices, raising wages, &amp; fighting corruption in Washington will be at the heart of our efforts in the Democratic House. #ForThePeople

Given his record of threats to undermine &amp; weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller’s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts
It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions’ firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine &amp; end Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.

Like many Americans, @RepJerryNadler is tired of watching Republicans in Washington refuse to stand up to the worst conduct of the Trump Administration. That’s why he’s fighting to clean up Washington #ForThePeople.
Whether he’s truthful or not, they just want a nominee who believes the President is above the law – constitutional or not.
In agreeing to the #FBIReport, Republicans pretended they were seeking truth. Instead by limiting it, they only sought cover.  They don’t want women to speak, and when they do, they just don’t listen.

Failure to postpone this vote without due process &amp; a thorough investigation into these serious &amp; credible allegations would be a dereliction of Congress' duty to demand zero tolerance of sexual harassment &amp; abuse.

For six months we have watched as the #GOPTaxScam enriched wealthy shareholders, rewarded companies that send jobs overseas, &amp; drove up health insurance costs for working families.
House Republicans are intent on labeling their anti-family immigration legislation as a “compromise.” It must be a compromise with the Devil, because it is *not* a compromise with Democrats.
Republicans continue to be complicit in @realDonaldTrump’s atrocities. Instead of standing up for families, they are pushing bills that serve to advance his shameful ideas. #FamiliesBelongTogether
I will always be proud to know that during my time as Speaker, the House passed the #DREAMAct.

We must also support efforts led by @NydiaVelazquez to investigate the alarming discrepancy between this report &amp; the official death toll. Our fellow Americans deserve to know that their government will be there for them, without question or hesitation.
8 months after the Trump Admin’s stunningly weak response, far too many of our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico lack power, adequate shelter &amp; other basic necessities. We must recommit to providing robust assistance to the families who are struggling to heal, rebuild &amp; recover.
A shocking new study has found that 4,645 people lost their lives in #PuertoRico as a result of Hurricane Maria, far more than the official death toll of 64. We mourn the loss of so many whose lives were tragically cut short. https://t.co/A767yfcG8Y

Our Armed Forces are made up of people from all walks of life – and so are those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. No matter their differences, they were *all* Americans. We would do well to remember that. #MemorialDay2018 https://t.co/pqIMcjitZd
This #MemorialDay, we take time to remember those who gave so much for our freedoms. We must honor their sacrifice by striving to build a better world &amp; making sure to watch after those they left behind.

The American people deserve better than a President who is eager to sell out the American people &amp; our national security for his personal enrichment.
Trump pledged to fight for Americans, but he's now using U.S. government resources to enrich ZTE (a foreign company designated a national cybersecurity risk) – right after the Chinese government reportedly agreed to funnel half a billion dollars into one of his family’s resorts.
.@realDonaldTrump’s ZTE deal is a staggering betrayal of the American people.
No victim of discrimination or harassment on Capitol Hill should be silenced. Now that the Senate has passed their version of the #MeToo Congress Act, it’s time for us to go to conference to produce a strong, final version that provides greater transparency &amp; accountability.
Our budget should reflect our values – but as countless people in Congo face a deadly Ebola outbreak, Republicans in Congress continue to push for a cruel rescissions package that eliminates funding for responding to life-threatening outbreaks. https://t.co/toDm27SmKu

Today's Gang of Eight briefing was conducted in a manner that protects sources &amp; methods. Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a “spy” in the Trump Campaign.
By choosing not to attend the Gang of 8 meeting today, @SpeakerRyan has abdicated his responsibility to the House &amp; the American people.
Congress can’t stand by &amp; let Americans believe their voices do not matter. That’s why it is so crucial that we give them #ABetterDeal for Our Democracy.  If you haven’t read the proposal, take a moment to read it here: https://t.co/Qjg4AVpNxH

There is a simple idea at the core of Democrats’ #ABetterDeal: that together, we can build a better future for all American families. #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/sBC3xASDxC
Like many things President Trump has promised in the past, it seems his commitments on prescription drugs are… less than reliable. #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/ULfBWnKyl3
We know what we need to do to stabilize the health insurance markets. Instead, the Administration prefers to focus on one thing: further sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. #PelosiTownHall
The #GOPTaxScam prioritized the wealthiest &amp; big corporations. That’s just a fact. The question we need to ask is: why wouldn’t we start the banquet with the middle class? #PelosiTownHall
Small businesses should be at the core of any effort to strengthen our economy. After all, they play a key role in creating new jobs. But that wasn’t the focus of the #GOPTaxScam – and neither was the middle class. #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/eKyXFV5wLP
.@realDonaldTrump said he would allow Medicare to negotiate “like crazy” to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Apparently, “like crazy” means not at all. #PelosiTownHall
About to step out on to the stage for #PelosiTownHall. See you out there! https://t.co/95HMP3uPwW

.@realDonaldTrump’s assault on the rule of law continues as he forces DOJ to reveal sensitive info regarding a probe of his campaign to himself &amp; his GOP fixers. FBI &amp; DOJ should include all members of the full Gang of 8 (including Dems). Anything less sets a damaging precedent.

House &amp; Senate Democrats came together on the steps of the US Capitol to take a stand against the culture of corruption in Trump’s Washington. #ABetterDeal https://t.co/wqgQQxHaTG
Today’s Supreme Court ruling picks corporations over people. The middle class was built on giving hardworking families a real voice. Now, a decision by five justices takes away the rights of millions of workers fighting discrimination, sexual harassment &amp; wage theft. #epicsystems
But our plan to bring better jobs, better wages, and a better future to American families goes so far beyond that. #ABetterDeal  Read all of the proposals here: https://t.co/2CPXlViyQ8
Today we released our #ABetterDeal proposal to: -Empower voters -Strengthen ethics laws -Fix our broken campaign finance system
Instead of fighting for working people, @realDonaldTrump has become the swamp he once railed against. Democrats a fighting for #ABetterDeal for Our Democracy, because your voice deserves to be heard. https://t.co/E6NufZ2pVD
Democrats are unveiling the latest #ABetterDeal proposal, “A Better Deal for Our Democracy.” Together we can put an end to the pay-to-play culture in Trump’s Washington. https://t.co/Qjg4AVpNxH

If you are looking to understand how the #GOPFarmBill failed Americans – and why Democrats voted against it – you should take a moment to watch @RepMarciaFudge’s weekly address. https://t.co/Z5opPcXEIW

Americans have made it clear they are worried about rising prescription drug prices – and it’s no wonder. They deserve #ABetterDeal which will let Medicare negotiate for lower prices &amp; cut costs for working families.
From the first day of his campaign, @realDonaldTrump promised to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma. And now, after months of delay, he has pulled his punch on fighting rising prescription drug costs. #BrokenPromises

Today is a sad day for America’s global leadership.  The Trump Administration’s dangerous &amp; impulsive action is no substitute for real global leadership.
Democrats have no illusions about the Iranian regime. We remain strongly committed to stopping the advancement of Iran’s ballistic missile program, its egregious human rights abuses, &amp; its support of terrorism &amp; other nefarious activities in the region.
.@realDonaldTrump’s decision to abdicate American leadership during a critical moment in our effort to advance a denuclearization agreement with North Korea is particularly senseless, disturbing &amp; dangerous.
The President's decision to follow his misguided &amp; uninformed campaign promise to destroy the successful JCPOA endangers global security &amp; defies comprehension.
Experts &amp; our allies all agree that this landmark agreement has been successful in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, &amp; even senior Trump Administration officials have confirmed that Iran has remained in compliance of the agreement.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a great diplomatic achievement. Yet, the President has chosen to utterly ignore that reality.
This rash decision isolates America, not Iran. https://t.co/u1GOUP6wBR https://t.co/cf8xRi9vWX

I’m speaking to reporters as @EPAScottPruitt comes to the Hill to answer questions. #CultureOfCorruption https://t.co/fOO3b8LEJO

I cannot say this enough: immigrants are the constant revitalization of America. To not accept that is to reject a core part of America’s proud history. #PelosiAtGU https://t.co/HZMcQu7hSx
I truly have a difficult time wrapping my mind around people who pray on Sunday, only to prey on others during the rest of the week. #PelosiAtGU https://t.co/sOqwnTB2xf
This young man’s story is a reminder of all that America’s immigrants have to offer. We cannot turn our backs on America’s immigrant tradition &amp; refuse to #ProtectDREAMers. #PelosiAtGU https://t.co/KZcnvuacC0
When people ask me what we are fighting for, the answer is always the same: the safety &amp; well-being of America’s children. #PelosiAtGU #ABetterDeal https://t.co/vMdLTmHo6a
The #GOPTaxScam is defined by creating a windfall for a small number of wealthy people &amp; companies – while ultimately raising taxes for 86 million middle class families. #PelosiAtGU https://t.co/i6wuGZb7bM
Protecting #NetNeutrality is a question of ethics, of innovation, and of job creation. #PelosiAtGU

The common thread seen through the #GOPTaxScam, the #TrumpBudget, &amp; the GOP’s higher ed proposal? They all sacrifice the financial security of students &amp; working families in the name of corporate profit. #StandWithStudents https://t.co/1dutyxszMj
Amid rising temperatures, surging seas &amp; record floods, fires &amp; storms, #EarthDay reminds us that bold, ambitious global leadership is needed now more than ever to combat the growing climate crisis.  https://t.co/jNwpPL91a4

Wishing my friend @RepBarbaraLee a happy 20th anniversary of her joining the House of Representatives. Your commitment to improving the lives of American families is inspirational &amp; well-worth celebrating.
On #JohnMuirDay, we recognize the importance a healthy environment plays in our communities &amp; our daily lives. And yet, 180 yrs after Muir’s birth, the Trump Admin refuses to appropriately address our duty to protect God’s creation. We must do more.
.@RepRichardNeal is at the forefront of the fight against the #GOPTaxScam &amp; he’s calling out the raw deal Republicans are offering America’s Middle Class. https://t.co/dznOSm6i9D
When will this end? Congress has a duty to act. #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence https://t.co/iq5PRPtMrC
But at least that secretary in Lancaster, PA got $1.50 more a week, right @SpeakerRyan? #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/ifPC89JKO6
19 years after the Columbine shooting, our hearts are with the victims, survivors &amp; families of Columbine, &amp; our voices are with all Americans demanding action to end this daily horror. https://t.co/EfdslCNco8
The #GOPTaxScam gave massive tax breaks to massive corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent at the expense of working men and women. You’ve exploded the deficit and are trying to ransack Medicare and Medicaid. Shameful. https://t.co/cdTlqcBlwQ
The release of #Comey Memos are further proof of @realDonaldTrump’s contempt for the rule of law. His attempts to intimidate, circumvent the law &amp; undermine integrity of law enforcement investigations demand immediate action to protect the Mueller investigation. #FollowTheFacts
Thankful to @CecileRichards for her kind words. At every turn, we have seen that when #WomenSucceed, America succeeds. We can never stop striving to ensure women &amp; families have the tools they need to thrive. #Time100 https://t.co/GClzN8VkyT

It was a pleasure to present @littlebigtown with the Creators Leadership Award at the #GRAMMYSOnTheHill. The use of their platform to advocate for music education, medical research &amp; rights of impoverished communities is to be celebrated! https://t.co/io56O9qs98
It seems every day brings more evidence that @EPAScottPruitt has no business working in public service. He must resign. #BootPruitt
The Trump Administration’s #CultureOfCorruption is – once again – costing the taxpayers dearly. @USTradeRep Lighthizer has spent nearly $1 million on furniture for 2 offices he oversees. https://t.co/FT1UGuGnay
We will never stop fighting for our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico. While we are still waiting on information as to what caused this blackout, it clearly reinforces the importance of investing in making the island’s electrical infrastructure more resilient. https://t.co/5Qd3IamUPw
This is completely false. The GOP #2018FarmBill cuts over $23 billion in SNAP benefits from hungry Americans. https://t.co/VPz8KdDimy
Tonight is a sad night for America. First Lady Barbara Bush will be remembered for the dignity, civility &amp; spirit she brought to every thing she did. But most of all, everyone who knew Mrs. Bush saw her immense love for &amp; pride in her family. https://t.co/bDrauy3U67
#TaxDay takeaway you won’t hear from @SpeakerRyan: #GOPTaxScam has wealthy shareholders celebrating their massive tax windfall. https://t.co/JWqYvkn8Sa
Must watch #TaxDay video. The #GOPTaxScam is simply useless when it comes to creating jobs. https://t.co/1NsEJZlzml
.@MClyburnFCC leaves behind a record of fighting to keep families connected &amp; making sure the FCC paid attention to the perspectives of consumers. Wish her the best in the next chapter of her journey. https://t.co/Q66KqMqlxa
You will want to keep this in mind as you hear the @HouseGOP spin the #GOPTaxScam today. #TaxDay https://t.co/ZrY0uP3Hhh
There is no excuse for forcing public servants to lie to the American people so the Administration can score political points. I agree with @RepLujanGrisham, @RepRichmond, &amp; @RepJudyChu – Chairman Gowdy &amp; @GOPoversight must investigate this troubling incident. https://t.co/3mPuW94gdQ
If the President plans to escalate militarily in Syria, he must come to the Congress to ask for an AUMF. Americans deserve a comprehensive strategy that will keep our military safe &amp; avoid collateral damage. https://t.co/IEkTIVyUSA
As always, Barbara Bush is a comfort to her friends &amp; family teaching us all how to live full of faith, love &amp; humor. Praying that she is comfortable &amp; send love to President Bush &amp; their family. https://t.co/Y02uohVFyD
From meeting with the first female head of NORTHCOM to meeting with Americans who count on Medicare &amp; Social Security for daily security, this was a week we’ll be remembering for a while. https://t.co/Q7VytpaHpZ
.@realDonaldTrump must come to Congress to obtain a new AUMF, present a clear set of objectives, &amp; ultimately hold Putin accountable for the bloodshed he has enabled. https://t.co/Mwdwbs289X https://t.co/9f3AB1SJnX
The latest chemical weapons attack against the Syrian people was a brutally inhuman war crime. Yet one night of airstrikes is no substitute for a coherent strategy.
On April 14, 2014, 276 schoolgirls were abducted by #BokoHaram in Nigeria. Four years later, 112 of the #ChibokGirls are still missing. I stand with @RepWilson in the fight to #BringBackOurGirls. https://t.co/vDFFaUTx1T
Trump is clearly trying to send a message with his pardon of Scooter Libby – he has no issue with rewarding those who lie under oath. But it does not change the facts: neither @POTUS or his allies are above the law.
.@realDonaldTrump’s pardon of Scooter Libby makes clear his contempt for the American tradition of the rule of law.
Our brave men &amp; women in uniform who make sacrifices every day deserve better leadership from their Commander-in-Chief instead of recklessly using Twitter to float his military plans. https://t.co/dEIJ4kqhmc
Very much looking forward to talking with the young people of @GUPolitics about the many issues that impact them &amp; their peers later this month. #ABetterDeal https://t.co/XI25QEoSKT
The Trump Administration's decision to end services that help immigrants understand their legal rights in this country is inexcusable. No matter who you are, you deserve to understand your rights when you go through our legal system. #SaveLOP https://t.co/CmOkG7ZrBP
.@HouseGOP’s #FarmBill proposal seals their betrayal of rural communities &amp; the seniors, veterans, individuals with disabilities &amp; vulnerable communities who rely on supplemental nutritional assistance to put food on the table. https://t.co/pwUiweVIiN

The People’s House is built on open &amp; honest debate of the issues facing American communities. @SpeakerRyan has made it his mission to stifle that debate. https://t.co/VgKK1onev4
The #GOPTaxScam mortgaged the futures of our seniors, children &amp; families to enrich wealthy corporations &amp; pharmaceutical companies. And now, they have the chutzpah to propose a massive attack on Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security.
The @HouseGOP is trying to ransack Medicare, Medcaid &amp; Social Security again. https://t.co/H08czwgETI
Just under 30 minutes until I speak live with reporters from the Capitol. Tune in as we discuss the @HouseGOP’s *most recent* attempt to ransack Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. https://t.co/o08LZ61RBL

President Trump’s utter contempt for the rule of law was clear in his disturbing attack on Special Counsel’s investigation tonight. The integrity of our democracy is at stake. @realDonaldTrump must get serious about our national security &amp; allow Mr. Mueller to #FollowTheFacts.
Key takeaways from new @USCBO report: -#GOPTaxScam driving $1+ trillion annual deficits starting in 2020 - @HouseGOP has exactly zero interest in fiscal responsibility -Debt’s size compared to GDP will likely become higher than we’ve seen since World War 2.
Congratulations, @SenDuckworth! Wishing the best to you, Bryan, Abigail &amp; little Maile Pearl. I’m sure she will grow up to be just as strong as her mother! https://t.co/naEXWSpRUr

If confirmed, another chemical weapons attack by Bashar al-Assad’s regime against its own people would be a war crime of staggering inhumanity.

Sitting down for the State of the Union was more painful than standing up for eight hours in heels in order to share the stories of America’s brave, patriotic DREAMers. #ProtectDREAMers https://t.co/6jTyOwSXXV
Fifty years after the loss of Dr. King, @RepJohnLewis reminds us that his vision wasn’t a thing of the past – it requires us to constantly recommit ourselves to the revolution of values &amp; ideas. #MLK50 https://t.co/hg4wj3W9mt
From his service during WWII, to his 30 yrs representing the people of Hawaii in the halls of Congress, Daniel Akaka’s legacy of action &amp; activism represent the best of America. May it be a comfort to his family that so many join in celebrating the life of this extraordinary man.
.@EPAScottPruitt's tenure has been a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.  Pruitt must resign. #PollutingPruitt https://t.co/BMBgJPKkXW https://t.co/xO1hV6xvxB
March’s disappointing #JobsReport shows that corporations &amp; powerful special interests are reaping massive windfalls from the #GOPTaxScam, while workers are denied the raises &amp; good-paying jobs they deserve. https://t.co/40C3h3XXKv
My prayers are with the loved ones &amp; families of the four Marines tragically lost in the helicopter crash in California. May it be a comfort for them to know that so many join them in their grief during this difficult time.
Instead of wasting resources on pointlessly sending troops to our border, @realDonaldTrump should work with Democrats to pass the DREAM Act &amp; #ProtectDREAMers.
.@realDonaldTrump is using every cynical political trick in the book to ignite anti-immigrant fervor. Needlessly militarizing our southern border won’t make Americans more safe – it’s just another political calculation.
Thank you to the firefighters of Southern California for all of your heroic work over the last year and every year. Know that we are deeply in your debt &amp; will make sure you have the tools you need to do your jobs &amp; pay that recognizes the weight of your sacrifice. https://t.co/9k2vdjLlBA

My staff &amp; I are closely following developments from the active shooter situation at YouTube HQ in San Bruno, CA. Thank you to our heroic first responders. Our Bay Area community – and all American communities – deserve real action to #EndGunViolence.

Anyone taking a serious look at the funding agreement will see that Democrats secured concrete progress that will create jobs, improve health &amp; advance economic security across America.
America must take strong, smart &amp; strategic action against China’s brazenly unfair trade policies. Today’s action is merely a start, the Trump Admin must do more to fight for American workers &amp; products. https://t.co/33vbEaOEnW
Democrats will continue to demand that Special Counsel Mueller's investigation be allowed to continue to #FollowTheFacts, unhindered by the White House or GOP Congress, &amp; will take real, immediate action to secure our elections from foreign interference. https://t.co/ZIVyL8ybna https://t.co/FDEldy5E7Y
The American people deserve American leadership, not a President willing to hand over our democracy to Putin.
The GOP is abdicating their oath to support and defend the Constitution &amp; protect the American people in yet another example of Republicans’ failure to address the Russian threat to our democracy, under @SpeakerRyan’s leadership.
Americans deserve a comprehensive &amp; fair investigation into Russia’s meddling in our elections. But from the start, the @HouseGOP has waged a cowardly campaign to obstruct, interfere &amp; cover-up the facts for President Trump.
Today, every Republican on the Intel Committee voted against America’s interests. #ProtectOurDemocracy

I have repeatedly expressed concerns to @SpeakerRyan about House Intelligence Committee Republicans’ lack of leadership and integrity.  The Speaker has refused to insist that the Committee #FollowTheFacts. Read my full statement: https://t.co/fqV8ISpxTv https://t.co/4PNdammMoj
With @SpeakerRyan's blessing, @HouseGOP has abandoned their oath to support/defend the Constitution &amp; protect Americans. Their decision to end the Intel investigation is another disturbing episode in their attempt to obstruct efforts to #FollowTheFacts on Trump-Russia scandal.

The way we honor our Founders is by working for a future that empowers our students. #FutureIsProgressive #ABetterDeal
Those looking for the @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP to abandon President Trump will be disappointed. On every one of his policies, they were there first. #FutureIsProgressive
Our Founders could never have imagined how different we would be — how many we would be. But they knew we had to be one. #FutureIsProgressive #ABetterDeal
#ABetterDeal means building a better future for American families all across the country. #FutureIsProgressive
Make no mistake: this Republican attempt to weaken Dodd-Frank’s reform of our finance system will mean tearing down the protections put in place to defend tax payers. #FutureIsProgressive #ABetterDeal

The financial deregulation ideas being pushed by the @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP threaten to drag us back to September 2008.
Certainly we are thankful whenever workers get bonuses. But it is *incredibly* telling that companies by-and-large chose to give out one-time bonuses, and not long term raises. #GOPTaxScam
Congressional Republicans are going through with their own version of #MarchMadness, pushing a financial deregulation bill that continues their shameful deference to Wall Street.

It’s clear that the Trump family has engaged in behavior that is corrosive to the integrity of public service.
I know that if we brought the Thompson-King bill to expand background checks up for a vote, it would pass. It’s a solid plan supported by Members of both parties. @SpeakerRyan should let the House vote.
We owe the families affected by gun violence a truly effective plan to save lives &amp; stop the daily tragedy of gun violence. #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence
While I am glad to see that @realDonaldTrump wants to ban bump stocks, I think it is clear this must be done through Congressional action. I hope we can proceed in a bipartisan way. #NeverAgain

Fully 97% of Americans, including 97% of gun owners, support requiring background checks for all gun buyers. The NRA’s stranglehold on GOP Leadership is the only reason the American people haven't gotten a vote on life-saving bipartisan background check legislation. #NeverAgain
Democrats are taking steps to force a vote on the bipartisan Thompson-King bill, which would require background checks for all commercial gun sales, including those made online or at gun shows. #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence

The release of the House Intelligence Committee Democrats’ memo helps set the record straight on Republicans’ attempts to obstruct the investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal.
I continue to tell people that the President cares about Dreamers because he has said repeatedly that he does.  He can prove it by supporting bipartisan proposals in the House and Senate.

Earlier today, the House passed the shameful #HR620, which undermines the Americans with Disabilities Act &amp; denies discrimination victims access to federal courts. Beyond all doubt, it's an insult to the 55 million Americans living w/ a disability.
.@SpeakerRyan, there are any number of ways we could anticipate &amp; prevent gun violence. There is no doubt in my mind that if legislation to expand background checks came to a vote, it would pass with bipartisan support. #EnoughIsEnough
Of course we pray for the families. But this can’t be just a moment of silence. No one’s political survival is more important than saving American lives. We must act to #EndGunViolence.

Too many families have lost someone to the senseless epidemic of gun violence. Congress has a moral responsibility to take common sense action to prevent the daily tragedy of gun violence in communities across America.  #EnoughIsEnough
Our deepest gratitude goes out to the heroic first responders who provided aid and comfort to those in need. As the families and friends of the victims mourn and others wait for word from their loved ones, Americans everywhere share in their shock and grief.
Today, another American community is reeling from the horror of gun violence, perpetrated against innocent school children. Our hearts ache for the people of Parkland, Florida and the entire Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community.
Devastating news out of Parkland, Florida. I’m grateful for our brave first responders and officials on the scene. We’ll continue to closely monitor.
Thankful to @BennieGThompson &amp; @RepBrady for their leadership of the Election Security Task Force. Today they release the task force’s recommendations to protect America’s elections in the years to come. #ProtectOurDemocracy

This week, I went to the House Floor to tell the stories of our patriotic DREAMers. As I look back at the week, here are a few of those stories that stood out: https://t.co/QacDaSBIfB
The US intel community has concluded, &amp; members of Trump’s cabinet agree, that the Russians interfered in our election &amp; plan to do so again. America’s national security is under attack. Why won’t the President put our country before his personal &amp; political interests?
This move by @realDonaldTrump confirms what we have all known for weeks — that his decision to release the #NunesMemo was a blatantly political move made without concern for national security. The hypocrisy is on full display. What does the President have to hide?
As a leading voice on transportation, @RepPeterDeFazio knows infrastructure is a critical piece of any effort to create quality, good-paying jobs. That’s why he fighting for #ABetterDeal to Rebuild America. https://t.co/Ksyh0trseU
When we #ProtectDreamers, we honor the highest ideals of America. Their patriotism, their perseverance, their optimism are an inspiration that stirs the conscience of our entire nation. https://t.co/3hrtOthbU4
This fight is not over. While I am disappointed that @SpeakerRyan lacks the courage lift the shadow of fear from these inspiring young ppl, I have hope.
Democrats worked hard to achieve bipartisan agreement &amp; assured @SpeakerRyan we weren’t interested in shutting down government. He responded need by refusing to a make real commitment to hold a vote to #ProtectDreamers
Republicans are celebrating the passage of their fifth stop-gap, short term Continuing Resolution on the heels of their second shutdown in a month — continuing government by dysfunction. #GOPshutdown
Members of the House deserve the same dignity that @SenateMajLdr showed Members of the Senate by allowing a vote on this issue. Read our full letter here: https://t.co/6qmVTxv8iU
A short time ago, I sent a letter to @SpeakerRyan, along with @WhipHoyer &amp; @clyburn, again requesting he publicly commit to bringing up bipartisan legislation to #ProtectDREAMers in the House.
It’s time for @SpeakerRyan to step up, stop hiding behind @realDonaldTrump, and commit to having a vote on bipartisan legislation to #ProtectDREAMers.
There is no excuse for the ongoing failure of Republicans in Washington to confront our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. This is a national security issue. This an economic issue. And we must act. #ABetterDeal https://t.co/NjL0FxrHmd

The grave pattern of attempts by @realDonaldTrump to undermine &amp; obstruct the effort to #FollowTheFacts on Russia is striking. https://t.co/ux8PPrQt5t
Pretty obnoxious the GOP thinks workers should be weak-kneed with gratitude for corporations giving them pennies while pocketing a multi-billion dollar tax break stolen from the future of the middle class. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/ulLIexUf4q
.@CecileRichards, wishing you the very best in your next chapter. Never doubt that your energy, intellect, &amp; determination have inspired millions &amp; helped so many stand up for their rights &amp; their health care. Thank you

Let me be clear: there is no such thing as a “good shutdown.” #TrumpShutdown
During the 2013 #GOPShutdown, @realDonaldTrump said of Pres. Obama “the problems start from the top and have to get solved from the top…”  But as President, he says “our country needs a good shutdown.” #TrumpShutdown
.@realDonaldTrump, @HouseGOP, &amp; @SenateGOP were so obsessed with the #GOPTaxScam, they were blinded to their duties to the American people. Despite controlling the White House, House, &amp; Senate, their incompetence meant they couldn’t keep government open. #TrumpShutdown
Tonight, on the eve of the first anniversary of his inauguration, @realDonaldTrump earned an ‘F’ for failure in leadership. #TrumpShutdown

Every year the Republicans plan the January schedule so that they can go to Davos, so they spend next week hobnobbing with their elitist friends instead of honoring their responsibilities to the American people by averting a #TrumpShutdown.
Andrea’s call for Congress to #ProtectDREAMers is something we all need to hear. https://t.co/RJhWz0yzMG
Let’s be clear: Democrats want a 10-year reauthorization of CHIP so our children don’t face another health care crisis like what the Republicans put them through over the last 4 months.
It’s not every day I agree with @realDonaldTrump, but I couldn’t agree more with the idea we need to address CHIP in the dedicated way it deserves, not part of this GOP ploy.

No matter where you live in America, our families are our strongest resource &amp; the bedrock of our communities. The idea that Republicans would deny immigrant families from staying together is inexcusable. #ValueOurFamilies
.@SpeakerRyan’s been holding a master class in politicizing our military. Here’s the reality: Dems have been clear abt our commitment to national security, helping vets, fighting opioid addiction, saving pensions, protecting DREAMers, &amp; so many more issues. He chose to ignore us.

From the Montgomery bus boycotts to his work w/ the Freedom Riders, &amp; on the steps of Lincoln Memorial, Dr King charged the nation to reject prejudice &amp; inequality.

We know how to create growth. We know how to create jobs. We know how to build strong futures for our children. Instead, Republicans forced through their #GOPTaxScam.

I have no doubt that: 1) If Democrats were in the majority, we would be working to #FollowTheFacts on Russia 2) And the @HouseGOP would be calling for a thorough investigation as well
Nothing less than the safety and security of our country is on the line. Republicans must abandon their failure to #FollowTheFacts over the last year.

Fernando is exactly the kind of young person America should be embracing. And he’s not alone. Across the nation, #DREAMers are contributing to &amp; strengthening our communities. America cannot afford to have Republicans continue to push them away.
Now a third year medical student at @UCSF, Fernando is contributing to research to fight many diseases and disorders.
Fernando was brought to the US when he was 9 yrs old. He was an AP scholar, received the IB Diploma, an Achievement Award in Foreign Language for French, and graduated cum laude from @SantaClaraUniv with a double major in Biology and French. He is undocumented.
The fight to #ProtectDREAMers will have impacts in communities all across America. Right in my district, a young man named Fernando is just one of many whose future hangs in the balance.
The stories of DREAMers like Tomas underscore just how dire this crisis is. We need to pass the #DREAMActNow! https://t.co/IXTtXep01i
Our country has been blessed with a long tradition of presidents who understand the importance of immigration. @realDonaldTrump’s vilification of these newcomers represents a complete reversal of that past.
Republicans have spent all of 2017 throwing gift-wrapped handouts to their donors and special interests. Now, they’re doing everything they can to avoid actually addressing the needs of every day Americans. #DoYourJob

Every credible analysis of the #GOPTaxScam says it explodes the deficit. And the @HouseGOP knows it.
-86 million middle class families get a tax hike -83% of benefits go to the top 1 percent -13 million Americans will be added to the rolls of the uninsured  That’s the real story of the #GOPTaxScam.
Democrats are speaking out after Republicans passed their con-job #GOPTaxScam &amp; raised taxes on 86 million middle class families. Watch here: https://t.co/Nl26p3OHzi

Republicans are about to take a victory lap to celebrate pillaging the future of America’s children. #GOPTaxScam
The American people will not forget the Republicans’ misrepresentations about the #GOPTaxScam.
No hearing. No expert testimony. No listening to the American people. That has been the story of the #GOPTaxScam.
Every member of the @SenateGOP should watch Laura’s story about how the #TaxCutsandJobsAct (really a #GOPTaxScam) would impact her son and her family. https://t.co/sNO7cr4q0D
Unsurprisingly, the #GOPTaxScam is so badly written the @HouseGOP will have to take *another* vote to pass it tomorrow morning. The seams of this Frankenstein’s monster are already showing.
Shamefully, Republicans were cheering against the children as they rob from their future and ransack the middle class to reward the rich #GOPTaxScam
There are few things more disturbing than hearing the swell of cheers from the @HouseGOP as they raise taxes on 86 million middle class families. #GOPTaxScam
A vote to pass the #GOPTaxScam is a vote to install a permanent plutocracy in America.
Incredibly moving argument against the #GOPTaxScam today from @AdyBarkan. #NotOnePenny https://t.co/nk9bJ7CbpC
Democrats are on the floor right now fighting to stop the #GOPTaxScam, which would hike taxes on 86 million middle class families. WATCH LIVE: https://t.co/BagwCxSb8X
We stand at a decisive moment for the future of America. The #GOPTaxScam takes the first step to obliterate Medicaid &amp; Medicare, while giving 83% of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and the victims still in critical condition following today’s Amtrak derailment. While no words can console those who lost loved ones, may it provide them some measure of comfort that so many grieve with them.
By the end, the #GOPTaxScam will… -Raise taxes on 86 million middle class households -Hand 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest 1% of Americans  This will go down as one of the most scandalous, obscene acts of plutocracy ever.
The #CorkerKickback is just another example of how the #GOPTaxScam is a Frankenstein’s monster of giveaways to special interests – and a reminder of why @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr are trying so hard to pass this bill before the public learns even more. https://t.co/I7hXWMbc15

.@AjitPaiFCC has eagerly led the effort to saddle consumers with higher costs and less choice, throttle competition and punish entrepreneurs and small businesses. #NetNeutrality
The power of the Internet has always been rooted in its role as a level playing field where the best ideas, not the deepest pockets, succeed. The @FCC’s decision to repeal #NetNeutrality is nothing short of radical.
Five years after #SandyHook, it’s still difficult to come to terms with the tragedy of that day. But this much is clear – even now, the only option we have is to #HonorWithAction. Anything less – anything – is unacceptable. https://t.co/pRSoOK053f
The @FCC just voted to throw away #NetNeutrality, which is central to saving families money, creating good-paying jobs, and empowering small businesses. https://t.co/ReB2ROxWF0
#NetNeutrality is what gives you the power to use to apps, games, and websites you like, no matter what your internet company thinks. The threat of losing that – and seeing costs go up for families – is why we must #SaveTheInternet from the @FCC. https://t.co/p0v6Eg5NKm
Forget CRomnibus — @HouseGOP’s proposed funding package is a “puntibus” that leaves urgent, must-address issues for another day. #DoYourJob
#NetNeutrality is central to building a good economy and ensuring we are creating high-quality, good-paying jobs for the 21st Century. @FCC should delay its vote to destroy it.
The idea that the @FCC’s process for throwing out #NetNeutrality could be in any way fraudulent is deeply concerning. We must protect the open internet!
At this point, it’s clear tax cuts for the rich are part of the Republicans’ DNA, no matter who it hurts. #GOPTaxScam #BillionairesFirst
With every version, the #GOPTaxScam becomes an even more brazen, damaging, and immoral con job. And all signs are the American people aren’t falling for it.
Republicans should think twice before voting for the #GOPTaxScam. Trickle down didn’t work before. It won’t work now. And Americans won’t forget who raised their taxes and left them holding the bill. https://t.co/AD3anREdnh
From Silicon Valley to the Quad Cities, #NetNeutrality makes sure small business owners have a shot in today’s economy. The @FCC must delay tomorrow’s vote to repeal. https://t.co/G6ppEnCvj5

Good to see that Americans are (rightly) seeing through the #GOPTaxScam. Ten of millions of middle class families will see a tax hike under this sham. https://t.co/PlJjTZ3BPl
Deeply thankful for the heroism &amp; excellence of first responders, not to mention the strength of the New York community, following today’s terrorist attack in Manhattan.
Personal highlight from this week? Meeting with Paddington Bear! https://t.co/i9feOBScfi

Republicans have made this no secret: the #GOPTaxScam — and the attacks on Medicare &amp; Medicaid it will trigger — will pillage and plunder the American Middle Class.
The radical Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill passed by the House yesterday is a gift to the NRA — and the first gun bill passed since #LasVegas. Appalling. #StopCCR
Tune in as I discuss the ongoing fight to stop the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/53zRVTqYEQ
The effort to stop the #GOPTaxScam is going strong. Be sure to watch at 10:45 am ET as I speak live from the Capitol.
Inviting violent criminals to carry concealed weapons doesn’t save lives Inviting domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons doesn’t save lives Inviting convicted stalkers to carry concealed weapons doesn’t save lives   Yet the @HouseGOP just voted to do exactly that #StopCCR
@SpeakerRyan .@SpeakerRyan, you’ve already admitted you will use #GOPTaxScam as an excuse to effectively end Medicare &amp; Medicaid as we know it — and for millions of families, that will feel awfully close to Armageddon. https://t.co/2DLGcjk6Ob
President Trump is the only person talking about a government shutdown. Democrats are hopeful the President will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep government open.
I couldn’t agree more with this decision. #BelieveWomen https://t.co/N7uBr4K1UI

This is why we need to be as loud as possible. #GOPTaxScam  https://t.co/VIippSRn47
For over 100 years, we have recognized that America is not America w/o its great #PublicLands. @realDonaldTrump’s decision to remove protections from major portions of Utah’s #BearsEars &amp; #GrandStaircaseEscalante presents a real threat to that tradition. https://t.co/xab15cnu7q
The #GOPTaxScam once again proves the @HouseGOP hasn’t learned from history. The LAST thing we should be doing is rewarding outsourcers with a tax break – but that’s exactly what they aim to do.
The #GOPTaxScam is one of the worst bills to be brought to the floor in the history of the United States. We will fight with everything we have to stop this bill from becoming the law of the land.
If you want to understand the importance of the fight to stop the #GOPTaxScam, look to the fight to stop #Trumpcare. That’s how crucial it is that we stop this thing.
.@HouseGOP’s partisan higher education bill pulls the rug out from millions of student loan borrowers across the country. Creating a two-tiered education system for rich vs. low-income Americans is the last thing we should be doing. https://t.co/0hQQz6WjFv

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump There is a bipartisan path forward on all of these items.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We have to provide funding for community health centers and CHIP, as well as relief for the millions of Americans still reeling from natural disasters. And we must also come together on a bipartisan deal to pass the DREAM Act along with tough border security measures.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We need to reach a budget agreement that equally boosts funds for our military and key priorities here at home including the opioid crisis, pension plans and rural infrastructure.
@SenSchumer We’re glad the White House has reached out and asked for a second meeting.  We hope @realDonaldTrump will go into this meeting with an open mind, rather than deciding that an agreement can’t be reached beforehand.
As negotiations with our Republican counterparts continue, we are hopeful the President will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep government open. Read my full statement w/ @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/figVYCgRsu

“GOP plan scraps deductions for the middle class to bankroll tax cuts for rich people.” That says all you need to know. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/QVSOEbfBuI
Now more than ever, we need a fully independent commission to #ProtectOurDemocracy from the types of meddling that took place in 2016. Republicans must stop shielding POTUS from those who wish to #FollowTheFacts.
Congress has a duty to uphold justice and ensure Robert Mueller’s investigation is able to #FollowTheFacts without White House interference.
The questions we need answered now: 1) What does @realDonaldTrump know about Russian meddling? 2) Why does he still refuse to take action against Russia?
We should all be alarmed by @realDonaldTrump's consistent attempts to obstruct effort to #FollowTheFacts on Russia.
Important to note that Michael Flynn is the 4th Trump campaign official to be charged in connection with the Russia investigation so far.
The guilty plea of President Trump’s former National Security Advisor Flynn to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian authorities marks a dark moment in our nation’s history. https://t.co/akxUDGur2y https://t.co/p0IlVIpWDv

Unless they’ve have been asleep for the last 30 years, there’s no excuse for Republicans continuing to push the disproven and failed “trickle down economics” in the #GOPTaxScam.
This is not how you help middle class families. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/aLv2sKuikr

#GOPTaxScam = a blatant attack on Americans’ health care https://t.co/GuSXYRndmF
According to experts, the #GOPTaxScam would slash home values by 10%.
The truth of the #GOPTaxScam is that Republicans marched past a large number of real ways to help empower our economy and decided to just give their donors a tax cut instead.
FACT: 82 million middle class families would get a tax hike under the #GOPTaxScam. And they’re not happy about it. https://t.co/OawcR9nOJo

@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenSchumer We look forward to continuing to work in good faith, as we have been for the last month, with our Republican colleagues in Congress to do just that.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenSchumer If the President, who already said earlier this year that ‘our country needs a good shutdown,’ isn’t interested in addressing the difficult year end agenda, we’ll work with those Republicans who are, as we did in April.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenSchumer We don’t have any time to waste in addressing the issues that confront us, so we’re going to continue to negotiate with Republican leaders who may be interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement.
Rather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won’t result in an agreement, we’ve asked @SenateMajLdr &amp; @SpeakerRyan to meet this afternoon. Read my full statement w/ @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/v17WhoEJFU

Read all about @HouseDemocrats &amp; @SenateDems’ plan to give Americans #ABetterDeal on prescription drugs: https://t.co/0XR7tXWUa5
Congress should be giving middle class families a break. Instead, GOP is borrowing from their kids' future &amp; putting #BillionairesFirst. https://t.co/TZ8IfP0qhM
So cute! https://t.co/yiw78nxEeZ
You can’t hand 80% of a bill’s tax cuts to the rich and then say its primary design is to help working families, @SpeakerRyan. #NotOnePenny https://t.co/fjO1Bm7u2G
How can @HouseGOP say #BillionairesFirst tax plan helps middle class families when it will slash home values by 10%? https://t.co/Y8L9EzW7zf
Words are not enough. The Admin must send up a viable funding request for this life-saving mission to succeed. https://t.co/dqsjZAGK4X https://t.co/Szwz9ZYIG5
Republicans are looting the health, financial security and the future of Middle Class families with #GOPBudget &amp; tax plan.
Republicans are carrying out a massive con on the American people with their #GOPBudget &amp; #BillionairesFirst tax plan.
Be sure to tune in at 10:45 am ET as I speak live about the devastating #GOPBudget &amp; #BillionairesFirst tax plan: https://t.co/M283pk2mWU
A woman’s access to contraception shouldn’t be up to her bosses and it shouldn’t be up to @POTUS. Tune in here: https://t.co/Qts6BVi5ca
Our budget should be a statement of our priorities, not a grab bag of gifts to wealthiest Americans. #GOPBudget
Instead of continuing this Admin’s civil rights attacks, @BetsyDevosED *should* be expanding opportunities for all. Clearly, she is failing. https://t.co/72wxJKkjpv
Reagan. Bush 41. Bush 43. They all tried "Trickle-Down Economics." And not once did it help working families. #NotOnePenny
Cutting our investments in education is – with stiff competition – one of the worst ideas the @HouseGOP has to offer.
#GOPBudget borrows from our children's future to give massive tax cuts to the rich.
It is completely wrong to force hard-working families to subsidize tax cuts for the richest families &amp; corporations in America. #NotOnePenny
Just ONE WEEK until it’s time to #GetCovered! Do you and your loved ones have health insurance? https://t.co/Vd0SRYg2U1

LIVE at 12:30 pm ET: @RepJohnYarmuth &amp; @RepRichardNeal join me to discuss #GOPBudget &amp; #BillionairesFirst tax plan: https://t.co/NyVNQOXWFx
Remain in awe of firefighters battling the fires in CA. You remind us of what we love so much about our communities! #CaliforniaWildfires
With so many tax cuts going to rich, how does @HouseGOP plan to pay for them all? Cut #Medicare. Cut #Medicaid.
Anyone who has looked at the numbers can see why Americans are rejecting this devastating tax plan. #NotOnePenny https://t.co/8xpWzXYOvp
If you have a family member on #Medicare or #Medicaid, you should be *very* concerned by the drastic cuts in the #GOPBudget.
"Fiscal hawks" have become an endangered species. It's the only explanation for their silence on #GOPBudget adding trillions to the deficit.
We can’t let Republicans get away with passing their #BillionairesFirst tax plan. #NotOnePenny https://t.co/33kK7pzdW3

Always a pleasure to chat with @joyannreid. Looking forward to tomorrow! #AMJoy https://t.co/vGPJzxh7gj

Wonderful to catch up with @chelseahandler earlier this week for @chelseashow! Don’t miss it! https://t.co/AAmNtlMseu
This is not what helping families looks like, @realDonaldTrump. Not at all. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/j67qShD9Ze
We have a responsibility to protect our borders. We do NOT have a responsibility to go after #DREAMers and their families. #TheView
Just a few minutes until I’m on #TheView. Looking forward to it! Be sure to watch at 11:20 am ET.
.@POTUS is claiming his decision to hike families' premiums is about blocking a “bailout” to insurance companies... https://t.co/lTa40gXI1K

From the #IranDeal to #ACA, President Trump is going rogue – and it’s not helping anyone. #ThisWeek https://t.co/pR52HQnWkh
If @realDonaldTrump really wanted to help people, why would he take them hostage and try to force his policies through? https://t.co/EslFJRGTYV
Democrats will not be cowed by @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to bully us into paying for his border wall. https://t.co/nlB8XBbhKa
The fight to #ProtectOurCare continues. It’s simply unconscionable that we have to fight @HouseGOP to fund children’s health insurance. https://t.co/wqLiG6vRJ2
.@realDonaldTrump's war on the Middle Class has never been more clear than in his tax plan &amp; ongoing attacks on the #ACA. #ThisWeek

Had a wonderful conversation with @davidaxelrod earlier this week. Be sure to watch Saturday at 7 pm ET on @CNN! #AxeFiles https://t.co/ns8v59G9JA
.@POTUS' decision to end #ACA cost-sharing payments means taxpayers will be forced to pay $200 billion for the privilege of higher premiums.
.@realDonaldTrump's threats against the #IranDeal are a grave mistake that threatens America's security &amp; credibility at a critical time.
Tune in now for my reaction to President Trump’s ongoing effort to sabotage the #ACA: https://t.co/dtde4cQF9G
.@POTUS’ decision to spike Americans’ health insurance premiums by 20% is an act of pure spite. Watch @ 2 pm ET: https://t.co/dtde4cQF9G

Matthew Shepard’s memory reminds us we must remain committed to fighting to #EraseHate across America. https://t.co/YPFfTyfcJ7
.@SpeakerRyan, you talk about wanting a “fully functioning Congress.” So why do you keep barring Democrats from putting our ideas forward? https://t.co/3vjWpzDfwF
This is striking: 50% of households that claim State &amp; Local Tax deduction make under $100K – &amp; now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away.
We are taking a stand against @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr’s effort to hike taxes on families. Watch here: https://t.co/tXCB54iLO3
Keeping the US safe means the rest of the world must take us seriously. If @POTUS undermines the #IranDeal, that becomes more unlikely.
No action to #EndGunViolence. No #jobs bill. No #infrastructure plan. And now GOP is sending Congress home for the week?
It's truly sad to see @POTUS dismiss the suffering of Americans in #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI. We must give more help, not less!
.@POTUS seems to think that saying "Stop the World! I want to get off" is a legitimate foreign policy. It is not. #IranDeal #ParisAgreement
We’re starting now. You can find the livestream for today’s press conference here: https://t.co/b9L07ECZAH

Another week has come to an end. Take a look at some of the moments that will stay with us here: https://t.co/1yH5KxshLh
Deeply, deeply moving words from survivors &amp; those who've lost loved ones to gun violence. You really need to watch this. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/cehXP1SoZN
If @POTUS cared so deeply about the Constitution, he wouldn’t have just trampled on a woman’s right to health care. #HandsOffMyBC
.@repjohnlewis knows our role in Congress is to lead the charge for change, not follow in its wake. I couldn’t agree more. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/PYvrm6krCJ
No woman should be subject to the whim of her employer to access the contraception that is her right #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/O9D5rAogHL
Millions of Americans in #PuertoRico and #USVI need our full and uncompromising support. Anything less is unacceptable.
The devastation of Harvey, Irma, and Maria have laid bare the corrosive effect of @HouseGOP‘s refusal to act on jobs https://t.co/gRyeQafF1w
AG Sessions can try to ignore the truth, but even his deep prejudice cannot erase the rights of #trans Americans. https://t.co/vy1ulrlsnV
Our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico and the #VirginIslands need our support. We cannot fail them. #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/0lxlz6HgQQ
Let's be clear: there is a difference between the NRA &amp; gun owners. Many gun owners want common sense efforts to #EndGunViolence.
Special consideration must be given to #DREAMers living in states &amp; communities impacted by Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
What is happening right now in #PuertoRico and the #VirginIslands is a challenge to the conscience of America. We must do more. https://t.co/v7hKUbqZWb
Cutting taxes for the rich while forcing hard-working families to pick up the bill. Cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid. No thanks! #GOPBudget https://t.co/BPOFiqdK9P
Our budget should represent our values. The #GOPBudget does just the opposite.
Republicans must allow a Select Committee on Gun Violence. They must allow us at least *look* for solutions. #EndGunViolence
Congress has a duty to protect Americans. We are failing in that mission. Republicans must let us take action. #EndGunViolence

Democrats are urging our Republican colleagues to take a stand to #EndGunViolence. Is that too much to ask? #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/OXiJ7hAYsw
I’ve been very clear: where we can find common ground, we will work with the GOP. When we cannot, we will stand our ground. #PelosiTownHall
Expanding background checks are common sense. Americans know it. @SpeakerRyan, it’s time for a vote. #PelosiTownHall https://t.co/na9NfXZ6St

How many have to die for the @HouseGOP to say #enough? This can’t wait. We can do something to end the drumbeat of gun tragedies.

When a hurricane hits, there are no Democrats or Republicans--only Americans, families struggling to survive. Shameful @POTUS can't see that
A budget should be a statement of values, but the purpose of this radical GOP budget is to hand tax breaks to billionaires.
Secy Price never should have been in charge at @HHSgov. The Admin should see this as opportunity to work w/ Dems to update #ACA https://t.co/nGU3Q66RN1

@BetsyDeVosED To survivors, across the country, know that I stand with you – that my fellow Democrats and I are fighting for you. 5/
@BetsyDeVosED It is concerning when anyone dismisses and discourages survivors to come forward. To make it the policy of our government is disgusting. 4/
@BetsyDeVosED I cannot state strongly enough how fundamentally outrageous this is for survivors, students and schools – how immoral it is. 3/
And yet today, the Trump Admin and @BetsyDeVosED rolled back Title IX progress &amp; protections for survivors of sexual assault. 2/
We should all be able to agree that all students have the right to be safe from fear &amp; harassment on campus. #StopBetsy 1/
.@SenJohnMcCain’s courage has always been clear. Thankful to him &amp; Americans who raised their voices for their strength &amp; determination.
We finally have a chance to put a stake in the heart of the #Trumpcare monstrosity. We can’t let up. The next days are crucial in this fight
