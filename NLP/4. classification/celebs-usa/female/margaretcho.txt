This wasn‚Äôt once or twice, this was constant interaction. I feel like @xychelsea used me and others because we are allies to members of the trans community and especially those with mental illness-trans or otherwise. I now believe supporting her was a mistake.
I supported @xychelsea through her ordeal and especially because I was consistently told she was either near death, suicidal or not getting support needed while in prison. I‚Äôm now hearing she is partying with white nationalists. This is disappointing.

He doesn't learn. He doesn't get it. You don't have jobs. You're not getting rid of us. He 's a failure. He's whack. Your hate cant persist.
