After many DMs back and forth it still seems this airline has zero respect for my equipment or our craft. @Delta how do you treat musicians? https://t.co/w5useZbskW
@AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back!
@AmericanAir Sent all my flight info. Ironic for this to happen in Nashville, where there are a few guitars on planes now and then!
Incredibly disappointing to see @AmericanAir refuse to honor a musician's right to carry a guitar on a plane as a 2nd item. Time to switch!

Sounds accurate! RT “@WholeFoods: @katevoegele At the very least, perhaps a simple "Nice pants!" might be creepy only 40% of the time?”
