"If you have a dream, fight for it.   It's not about how many times you get rejected, it's about how many times you stand up and are brave and keep going."  Preach, Gaga. Preach.  #Oscars
@rickandersonoc True, but you don't have the benefit of audio sweetening in real time on an awards show :)
For as talented as Bradley Cooper is, he's still on stage right now with a rock star who actually sings for a living.   That can't be easy. This ain't a film. He gets one take.   #Oscars

@emoneytrain87 "Read BEYOND" is different from "ignore."  It means... look further.
@pappa_brock Prostitution is different than sex trafficking. Hookers make a conscious decision to do what they do. Sex trafficking victims are held captive, forced to have sex with people, and live under inhumane conditions
@CatRP How does that minimize the realities of human trafficking?   Oh, wait. It doesn't. Carry on.
Take the time to read beyond the flashy headline, folks.   Take the time to read about human trafficking and how it is equal parts sick, harrowing, tragic... and profitable for the disgusting people pulling the strings.   #RobertKraft

@rosenbaumlaw Exactly right, Ary. And the ability for sentiment to spread like wildfire on social media and the "group think" mentality that comes with that... you gotta have reallllly strong leadership and trust with boosters to pull through a hire like that. Optics, optics, optics...
I don't know Art Briles well. Has he changed? Does he deserve a 2nd chance? Only he knows.   But unless a university is TRULY prepared to weather the storm of public scrutiny and boosters jumping ship, Briles will not, can not, work in college FB again any time soon.

.@mikeblair3 1) That's Belichick's defensive playbook; 2) The ball didn't throw itself to Gronk to set up the TD 😉 https://t.co/xt36n68IRA
Know so many people who picked the Rams to win. Anointed McVay as the Second Coming.  He's gifted. All the credit for turning the Rams around in a hurry.  But he's no Belichick. And Goff's no Brady.   At least not yet.
Such good tempo on this drive... where the heck's this been all game?
@dannyboycane13 standard operating procedure, lol... 😁
I'd argue that while Sony Michel scored, the Gronk catch was worthy of greater praise.   (And a fantastic final catch to go out on, if this is his swan song...)  #SuperBowl #Pats

@wdelpilar @Saints You also can't deny there's a chance the Saints would have turned the ball over and the Rams ran it back for a score, so...
@jmerrickflorida Yeah. What JFM says... :)
@mikkirsch Awwwww... ❤️ #JerseyStrong
@YoungMaverick62 Terrible call, indeed, Brett! But no one on earth with 2 eyes disputes that.   Heck, no one with ONE eye would dispute that...
@mikkirsch God bless you for having a memory this amazing, lol! I only wish I could remember what I had for a snack 2 hours ago 😂
You know what else changed the result, @JoeDeMarzo? Dan Arnold's dropped TD pass in the 1Q.   If he scored, Saints woulda won 30-26 (or 29-26 if XP failed), even WITH the PI non-call.   But, again, that 1 play wasn't the SOLE reason Saints lost. https://t.co/Yguo9r7dGR
@BigR49 How about the missed Goff facemask? Wasn't the only blown play in the game...
@dimennayear1 @Johnny___Tapia @Robert_Iadanza No, I would not.
Appreciate the fan uproar, angry billboards, desire to sue Commish to replay end of NFC Champ.   But the reality is NO was up 13-0. LA came back. There were missed plays/strategy choices thruout gm that could've impacted the outcome. Saints didn't lose SOLELY on a PI non-call.

Reality check:  1) There's 2:03 left in the game  2) Tom Brady
@EEmersonWhite The whining from Pats fans whining about non-Pats fans is equally as entertaining, lol 😉
Can you remember another season where officiating was such a major headline in BOTH conference championship games?
Reality Check:  There's 7:45 left in the game.   Tom Brady.
Hmm...Edelman's thumb??  What do you think?
Wow. That wasn't even close...
Don't know why, but of all the incredible things Patrick Mahomes does, I get the biggest kick about the sidearm action...
@islesfan28 No, not at all! Covered Sammy in college :)
As someone who had Sammy Watkins on her fantasy team, I can blindly confirm that was his biggest catch all season 😁

@GT25Ump Doesn't matter. Silent count and methods of communication to counter noise is SOP for dome games!
So much discussion about crowd noise in this game.   It's the Superdome. Crowd noise has been an issue in every major game I've worked there.   It's not new news. Nor should it be surprising to the Rams.

While much of Mel Stottlemyre's legacy was built in Bronx Bombers Pinstripes, he was the pitching coach for a 16 year old's favorite team when they won the 1986 World Series.   He helped hone the gift that was Doc Gooden's right arm.   #RIPMel, from this lifelong Mets fan.
@BiloRatedSports Ahhhh, but that's only IF he actually plays football. Just because he declares for the draft, doesn't mean he's shutting the door on baseball...
@myklcallao25 If he doesn't impress you as a QB, you haven't been watching, lol. Watching him run, with the quickness he does, while still keeping eyes downfield, is an incredible thing to watch... and the young man can make the throws.
@JeffGoldklang Totally understand where you're coming from! Many families, however, see their kids as a conduit to a better life. Thankfully, Murray's fam doesn't fall in that category...
@Six_Sparrows Pretty! I like that distressed nightstand :)
@steveskelton68 Size is def an issue. If he leaves the pocket a lot and puts his incredible athleticism to work, I worry he could wind up like RGIII. Prob with Griffin was that he'd never slide or get OB. Murray would need to be smart about protecting himself.
@RFIPRAM IMO, he has a better shot at baseball, and he likely knows that. It's about leverage more than anything else...
@jeffolindsey If he signs w NFL and doesn't play baseball, he'll have to
Reality: any smart person in Kyler Murray's circle of trust would have said, "You HAVE to declare for the NFL Draft."  1) More $$ out gate in NFL  2) Likely start sooner in NFL   3) NFL option creates leverage/inspire A's/MLB to be creative in finding more $$$ for him.
Drew Brees continues to build his legacy... heart goes out to Nick Foles.  Amazing story. Terrific guy, who’s stepped in and stepped up... model player. If he’s not in Philly next year, his next team will be lucky to have him.   #Eagles

@clotterman Holding is a mental mistake, plain and simple. By this logic, every time an O-lineman faced Cox, Aaron Donald, etc, they’d incur a penalty, lol!
Tell you what... If Saints move on, Andrus Peat should buy Brees, Kamara, Thomas, Taysom Hill— heck, the whole offense— big fat juicy steaks for bailing his flag-prone booty outta trouble.  #Saints #PHIvsNO
Michael Thomas is simply...  💰 💰 💰 💰
I hear you, @kevinburkhardt, givin NJ a home state shoutout after @Kirkwood_Five’s TD!! #Neptune   #JerseyStrong 👊 #Saints #PHIvsNO
@ajaved24 Indeed. He is the G.O.A.T. for a reason... feel fortunate to have been on the sideline the day he stepped in for Bledsoe. Who knew back then what his legacy would become...
@WayneTyson11 Yessir. Spot on, Wayne 👍
@timjahr Haha. Do love my Giants, but my tweet was supporting someone, not rooting against anyone.
@jru37726 That’s some impressive selective memory, lol! He plowed thru pretty much every ACC passing record and, oh by the way, had zero influence on coaching and recruitment. One player of 22. 😊
@RuddysRationale Nah. Life’s too short to waste energy on rooting against people
Patriots certainly earning right to advance, but when you do what we do long enough, you start rooting for *people* over teams.  And that part of me wishes Philip Rivers could experience a Super Bowl.  #Chargers #LACvsNE
@MarkRabenold Lol... think I need to start doing this with The Better Half (though he usually beats me out of bed...)
@KingKeiff All good :)
@NESaavy9970 Haha... modest, but it serves its purpose 😊

@moose6747 Ohhhhhh, this makes me sad. Gone too soon...
Remind me, again, how defense is Kansas City's Achilles heel?...  #INDvsKC #NFLPlayoffs
@jockhanncock68 That's fair. Guys doin the essential grunt work like slop :)
@KingKeiff Wow. What a negative interpretation of a tweet that everything to do with the *weather* and nothing to do with the city (which so happens to be my favorite NFL city!)
@RFIPRAM Right there with ya! 🔥
@CountDownDave Haha!
@BrettFavre_4 @BrettFavre See: picnic basket 😆
Any player who says he likes playing in Kansas City’s current weather conditions is lying...   ...or a few sandwiches short of a picnic basket.   #INDvsKC #NFLPlayoffs
@DeanLew13089931 @nflnetwork @richeisen So good.

@4stickers Haha. Run that by Coach and lemme know how it goes 😉
@CColl3 Totally agree, Chip! But lots of folks wanted to use the quality of play in the conference this year as an indictment on Clemson
Soooo, remember the skeptics who railed on Clemson’s strength of schedule and the ACC havin a down year?  Yeah. About that...
Wanna know how much Etienne’s emergence has meant to #Clemson?  The Tigers’ leading rusher last year was...   QB Kelly Bryant.  #CFBChampionship
Boggles my mind how special teams is  actually a sore spot for both of these teams.   9 missed PATs for Bama this year? When details are such a fundamental part of “The Process?”   Nuts.
Yup. I can read lips.  It was something like, “Dadgummit, Tua.”
Tell you what... weather in San Jose last 2 days has been abysmal... but today? *Spectacular* night for a nat’l championship.  Good on you, Mom Nature 👏 🏈
It’s GO TIME!!  Who ya got fans?   #CFPNationalChampionship #CFBPlayoff

@MsPotts_ATL @Gina_Lehe Go. To. Bed.
@kcflatlander @Gina_Lehe @MsPotts_ATL I still have all credentials from major events. One day, I will make a wall full of them... (that all of my employers paid for 😊)
Ahem. “@bebe” will never be out of style.   It’s my name. Don’t wear it out. #BB https://t.co/Xude2cRAeq

I’m on the road, so I don’t have any back-in-the-day photos of us that would make you smile.  But every January 4th, for the last 4 years, my heart hurts.  Hope you know how much we all miss you down here.   Boo ya. #RIPStuScott
The band geek in me finds watching Ohio State’s marching band perform Bohemian Rhapsody equally as compelling as watching Dwayne Haskins shred Washington.  #RoseBowl2019 #Buckeyes #TBDBITL
Reading about all this childish nonsense going on with the Steelers... and all I can think is: poor Mr. Rooney must be rolling in his grave.  If you’re old enough to remember the model patriarch and good soul he was, you know what I mean...
Just did my Instagram #BestNine.  Definitely didn’t expect what turned up. 👉 https://t.co/FRH5WhNmcP  What were some of your best moments of 2018?   #HappyNewYear
We don’t know (yet) why Mark Richt retired out of the blue...  What we do know? The game of college football is worse without him. One of the true class acts in the business.    Not lip-service-putting-on-a-face-for-recruits-and-social-media class acts.  The real deal.
Didn’t win @IBMSports Fantasy Football League... but the participation trophy in my vid’s gotta be the coolest consolation prize ever!  Who used @IBMWatson analytics this year to help set their lineups?   👍? 👎? Gimme some good feedback!  #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner 🏈 https://t.co/Ih2CJQI10q
Yikes.
.@BrentThompson I'll counter that with: UGA nearly beat Bama in SEC title game. Plus: Committee has shown forgiveness for 1-loss. Examples: Clemson dropping to Cuse last year... and Ohio St losing to Va Tech, then going on to win nat'l championship :) https://t.co/YDTTfJx48K
Hear ya, @ccfashionistic, and see your point. But many (incl CFP Committee) view 2-losses as a non-starter for Playoff inclusion.  Fascinating debate, tho, bc I do feel UGA is one of the most *balanced* teams in the country...  Curious- how do my other Tweeps weigh in here?? https://t.co/C7ZUATm4XU
.@boudreau_dr Does it make sense you think it's cool to sh!* on people as some sort of price to pay for making a good salary?   Read that out loud, dude... 🤦‍♀️ https://t.co/G6JCFRz90M
@ChrisWStirling So true, Chris... adore and admire them both!!
How on earth does a reporter's salary have anything to do with whether a coach is cooperative at halftime, @rezzhead??  Good grief... https://t.co/oQDDLnfddQ
@swervinerv82 Haha. I should cut it off after 1Q...
.@EastKYRetro IMHO, most imp thing is not viewing diet/exercise as a temporary solution. Gotta commit to a permanent lifestyle shift!  I'm like a squirrel on the road... always have healthy snacks stashed in my bag, so I don't spontaneously grab something crappy https://t.co/9p7Pt09PYd
Having done a few of these lil sideline interviews, appreciate how engaged Dabo and Kelly were with Holly/Tom before heading to locker room  Little things like that genuinely make a tough job worth it!  #CFBPlayoffs #CottonBowl
@fritdog23 Bahahahahaha. Well done, Mike!
"Hold my beer, OBJ"  -- Tee Higgins thought bubble 😉  #OneHandTD #Clemson #CFBPlayoff
Trevor Lawrence ain't your grandaddy's true freshman.   That's for damn sure.   #Clemson #CFBPlayoff #CottonBowl
@mcwups1 .@mcwups1 Welll, ummmm... 1) Notre Dame, while playing a package of ACC games, is still technically considered "independent."  2) Pac-12 just saw your tweet and said "Hold my beer." 😉
@WayneandCable Oh, absolutely discussed in produx mtg! My only point was it was nice to see Allison involved in the cross-promotion. Unfortunately the sideline position, even in 2018, is still considered a bit of an ancillary appendage :) Enjoy the games!
@MartyBannister #THIS  :)
.@mavants Trevor's a special talent. His poise and pocket awareness for a true freshman amaze me!   Then again, so many talented QBs these days are specializing early,  so they're more prepared than ever to contribute in college right away https://t.co/9jRn6zNlMa
.@3125214DC Drives me nuts when ppl compare teams that way..   2012 and 2018? There's not a single kid from that first roster. https://t.co/Srn3OFkJjz
Lots of folks not even giving Notre Dame a chance vs Clemson even w the Tigers missing Dexter Lawrence on the DL.   I suspect it may be a bit closer than many expect! Who you got... and why?  #CFP #CFBPlayoff#CottonBowl
@WayneandCable Sideline reporters seldom promote other games.  With a few exceptions, they  tend to focus on in-game injuries, reflections from their vantage point, and human interest stories. Produx teams' promotional responsibilities are primarily handled in the booth.
@WayneandCable When was the last time you heard a sideline reporter reference work from another sideline reporter covering a different game?   Been doing this 26 yrs. First for me.
@NoLimitSports17 @AllisonW_Sports @MariaTaylor I'd actually name it after Lesley Visser, but thank you! 🙏
Great game synergy just now in #PeachBowl...   Sideline reporter @AllisonW_Sports citing a Tua injury update, via Orange Bowl reporter @MariaTaylor, for upcoming Bama/OU bout.  One of biggest storylines today... nice job, ladies! (And props to Peach Bowl producer...)

@BosoxMikeD Golly gee whiz. Saw BoSox in your profile name, figured you for a Pats fan.   Regardless, it's the holiday season. Perhaps experiment with being kinder on social media. It won't hurt. Promise :)
@BosoxMikeD Not a very nice thing to say, Mike.   (Esp considering he’s got 2 Super Bowl rings against your team 🤷‍♀️) #Truth #HappyHolidays

@shawnsprings @WindpactInc Former athletes are everywhere in business. Research shows the life skills acquired in the field of play are a huge factor in professional success!!
#SundayShoutout: to ex-Seahawks/Skins DB @shawnsprings. Saw this spot abt company he founded called @WindpactInc that’s developing helmet tech to make the game safer.  Yet another athlete entrepreneur dong great things in his playing afterlife!! 👍👊 #SportsTech #SportsBiz https://t.co/kpIEqEKE6W
@whiskepriest @IBMWatson Football guys is one of my fave fantasy pods! Great personalities 👍
Perfect holiday gift for the Fantasy FB owner in your life? KNOWLEDGE 🤓  .@IBMWatson’s got your back: Boom/bust analytics. Media buzz. Tens of thousands of info tidbits right in your ESPN app to help you crush your lineup.   Jingle jingle! 🎅🏻 🏈   #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/LvZNzBvfq0
@dbmsu Texas was far worse off when Strong got there. USF crushed first season. Nearly beat UCF last year + took down TTU in bowl. Things went downhill 2nd half of this season.
Not at all surprising, for those who remember Strong doing a pretty thorough "cleanse" when he first got to Texas... https://t.co/MFyXzukeA7

@DrBhrettMcCabe Sadly, most people don't realize how prevalent mental health issues are in our society. We all have to work to destigmatize... but it seems there's some progress...
@DrBhrettMcCabe Of course, but as I’m sure you know much better than I, the person genuinely has to want help... and be committed to the very hard work and tough road to getting clean!
There comes a time when it appears someone is beyond help.  Josh Gordon is teetering on that edge.  So, so sad.
THANKS to everyone who sent in questions for the chat. Hope @IBMWatson and I were helpful!  Good luck the rest of the way for those of you who are vying for championships 🏈 🏆  #AMAFantasyFootball
.@eryanobrien More help with trades, tbh. In order for me to feel comfortable pullin trigger on new guys, I comb thru stats. If @IBMWatson could help cut down on the heavy lifting, that would be awesome... esp mid-season, when you wanna shake things up!  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/bKL67d8af4
.@DanielDopp Always check @IBMWatson Media Buzz. Obv read a ton, but can't get to everything. Player articles are all in 1 tidy place, so I can check on my guys before locking my lineup!  So. Much. Stuff. In. There. Pretty mindboggling, actually...   #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/55VAKyjuUl
.@JohnCUrschel Moved Jordy Nelson into lineup after a big wk. Stuck with him, despite @IBMWatson projections to go w other dudes... and it kinda burned me.   (Then, of course, as soon as I bench him, he puts up 100 yards, lol. #MurphysLaw)  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/2biCTUv3nu
@BrettFavre_4 Oooooooh. So ticked at Henry right now, bc he piled on vs my G-Men last week 😥 #BigBlue  But, being objective... agree w @IBMWatson here. Henry on a roll and Skins D's been giving up ton of rush yards...   #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/dbHl42Exmd
.@Stephania_ESPN Well, since we split our match-ups, @IBMWatson obv had a hard time choosing sides, lol!   Same, tho... Boom/Bust!

Hey, @RKMeibalane! You'd be amazed how much time I spend contemplating *how* to ask tough questions. Wanna avoid sounding confrontational, but also need to show you know your facts and are just trying to do your job. Gotta leave all emotion out of it!   #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/8DuEXQBQFP
@The202Sports @IBMSports Well, will run this one back atchya: how risk averse are you??  Take a peek at @IBMWatson player comparison: Robinson if you like takin chances... wanna play it safe? Baldwin's your guy...   #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/HjI7lDloFo
Ohhhh, don't even get me started on you double/triple/quadruple dippers, @BrianBruemmer!  Who else of you guys is playing in multiple leagues?  It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul 😂 I'm a mono-league fantasy girl, myself...  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/5Tpu4X39Hr
.@FieldYates TBH, there were days I wanted to fire every single dude on my team... EXCEPT Melvin Gordon! Absolute beast in our lil 3 RB league. His injury's prob one of the reasons I'm not winning this thing.  (In my head)  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/xtSCnAWzZp
13-0?? Wanna be the GM of my team next year, lol?   First: CONGRATS, @burner_osu. Amazing! Obv doing something right...   HOW-EV-UH... @IBMWatson sifts thru 2 MILLION articles a day. That can't possibly be a bad thing... 😉  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/7SUjlDf7bR
@Nolan_Victor @IBMSports I feel like this is a trick question, Nolan, lol. Yeah, if you look at player comparisons, DJ has the slight edge.   But he's also a fellow Terp, so my heart has to go with him! 🐢 🐢 #GOTERPS  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/tzGM5igbfq
@nz1701d @IBMSports What's up, Kathleen! Went thru this every single week, bc I had Cam and Phil Rivers 👊   @IBMWatson Boom/Bust projections give Cam a slight edge here (Watson's been pretty spot on for me this yr on QB front).   Plus, always love that he's a dual threat!  #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/1mb0RzyLwl
Click on his player card in ESPN Fantasy app and look for 'IBM Insights" tab up top!    According to @IBMWatson, 20% chance to "Boom" vs. nearly 17% "Bust" probability. SEA Top 10 D this year in ESPN fantasy... held half of opps to &lt;100 yards. #AMAFantasyFootball https://t.co/17jSq3wG8D

Wow. Mr. Jackson if you’re nasty. Incredible pass D.   Secondary coaches at all levels, clip that off and show it to your players. Dang...  #Patriots
It’s crazy. I did my last AFC sideline game for CBS in 2006.  12 years later, the same 2 QBs are behind center for their respective teams.  Gives me such an appreciation for the longevity and legacy of Brady and Roethlisberger...  #NEvsPIT

@DanLisaH1 @DanWolken I didn't say a word on social while working on the investigation. Wasn't our place! We were tasked with presenting a report to Maryland's Bd. of Regents, which served as a resource in their decision-making. They presented the report to the public. Thx for asking...
@SteveDeClue2 @DanWolken Believe me, Steve... I understand how powerful emotion can be in such a tragic situation. But as journalists, we're trained to compartmentalize emotion from facts... so, I've tried really hard to do that...
@cwils26 Great question! To be honest, I look at every situation individually. Urban is a legendary coach. But he's polarizing, for sure. (And I'm not totally convinced he's done, lol...)
@WaiteMarc They did not initially. A lot has changed. Emotion and outside influences took hold. Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to reach out, Marc... happy holidays. Count your blessings!
@WaiteMarc What does this have to do with your tweet about Jordan's parents and my response?
@WaiteMarc @DanWolken Then why did they ask him to speak at Jordan's funeral?

@todd7374 More recently than 25 yrs. And not just in college ranks. But you are correct about the unparalleled influence in 2018 of public opinion...
@pilotpack97 Certainly entitled to your opinion, sir, as unfortunately misguided as it might be 😊 Hope you and yours have a wonderful holiday season!
@pilotpack97 @DanWolken No. I served on the commission and busted my tail for 3 months helping put together the most fair, factual, comprehensive report we could assemble under insane pressure and more insane timelines.  However, we did not have any say in Regents' decisions.    Good day.
@pilotpack97 @DanWolken We spoke with nearly 200 people for our investigation. I can tell you what every single one of them said.   Comments were all over the board.
@misteryork1 @DanWolken Bama brought in Lane Kiffin. One of more reviled college coaches out there.  Brought in Steve Sarkisian, who was fired from USC after substance issues revealed.   They both thrived...
@pilotpack97 @DanWolken Highly recommend you read the report, esp appendix where there are letters from players and their families.
@RyanSublett1 @DanWolken You are exactly right, Ryan...
Hey there, Jason...  Was it flawed? It was.   Was DJ at fault for not reigning in his strength coach? 100%  Were some players/coaches unhappy? Yes. But did lots of folks love DJ/program? They did.   I can tell you first hand, this was anything but a clear-cut situation. https://t.co/kr4C3YTcSn
.@DanWolken Maybe Saban read the medical investigation, which concluded DJ Durkin did not cause Jordan McNair's death.  Culture did not kill Jordan McNair. A horrible, tragic, unfortunate medical misdiagnosis did.   Which could have happened at any program in America. https://t.co/aL7qbMulYV

Hi, @Tufftruth! CFP is separate entity from NCAA. NCAA does not determine Playoff teams. CFP committee does.   Also- CFP has explicitly stated mission is to place 4 BEST teams in Playoff. Lotta qualifiers there, but no "1 team per conf" mandate (obviously) 😊 https://t.co/BXLRtDQkst
Me... to anyone who seriously thinks SEC would abandon its championship for an expanded playoff.  Did you watch? UGA nearly upended Bama a couple weeks ago. A team many opined is the best Tide team EVER.  Plus, it’s a ginormous cash cow.  Stop. Please stop. https://t.co/GrFPxrm52q

1 of more challenging elements of #HeismanTrophy is subjectivity of voting.   Stats coulda justified any of top 3 winning.    But If you heavily weigh "overall value to team," Murray was your vote, bc OU's defense was subpar most of year

What Kyler Murray's dad just said about his son's mental maturity is SO important, not just in sports, but life.   "Don't let the moment be too big, one play at a time."  One of the most critical and valuable lessons I've learned in my lifetime, for sure...  #Heisman2018 #Sooners
@txterp98 Ohmygosh... don’t get me started on that, lol...
Alrightee, college FB fans. This is considered among the most competitive #HeismanTrophy races ever.  Curious- If you had a vote, who’s your guy (and respond with your “why!”)
Holy crap. That hit.  #ArmyNavyGame
@lstmohecn @ArmyWP_Football @NavyFB Awwwww... 🙏
The story behind this photo... and one of the most significant days of my journalism career. #ArmyNavy   👉 https://t.co/M6AAtOiz93  @ArmyWP_Football @NavyFB https://t.co/LhLyLfjGNH
No matter where you're from, or what team you love, #ArmyNavyGame is America's greatest football rivalry.   Because it's about so much more than football.  One of the greatest privileges of my lifetime? Working sideline for this game in 2001, post-9/11.
PLAYOFFS? We’re talkin (fantasy) PLAYOFFS?  Channeling a lifetime of experience to share my sage wisdom.  Question is, who among you will actually listen? Cuz it ain’t easy... 😉   @IBMWatson #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/0HccSN57Fr
@BruinDre33 Truth!
@IronRooster606 Haha- probably...
@JosephHaas2 Never miss it. One of fav games of year!!
I swear, It’s the weirdest thing.   I bust a$$ during CFB season, and as soon as reg season’s over, I get sick.  Like my body somehow knows this is the first Saturday I can actually sleep in... 😷
@ArtPerry Much appreciated, Art!
@jpingleby Thank u!
@MarkHar39612396 @ClayTravis @Outkick @CMT Thank you Mark Harrison 😉
Fascinating piece about the culture of Tua Tagovailoa’s family— from American Samoa to Hawaii to Tuscaloosa... choices made around leadership vs family, and how it’s all shaped Alabam’s QB—&gt;   https://t.co/kY7kGjcrKL
@BaxFootballGuru Thx, my friend!
Ran the gamut of topics today with @claytravis on @Outkick:   #CountryOnCampus on @cmt, Heisman voting, postmortem on Terps football investigation... good stuff --&gt; https://t.co/GvGQRAiPYT
Such a treat spending time with @saraevansmusic &amp; @JayBarker7. Their "first date" story is something you won't wanna miss! #RelationshipGoals 💞  Next #CountryOnCampus, 9a ET/8a CT on @CMT. Sneak peak below 👇 https://t.co/kHN95cF0My
@MrsDBHams Do it, Damaris... the only thing stopping you... is YOU 👊 💪   #DreamBig #MakeItHappen
@ScottASnyder2 Lotta discussion about whether he'd be better OC/recruiting coordinator vs HC...
@dandeman330 I work in sports for a living AND Maryland is my alma mater. So, yeah... well  aware of the history 😉... which also includes the most visible program in the country hiring him. After heavily vetting him.
No inside knowledge on Mike Locksley as Maryland's new HC.   His 2-6 record leading New Mexico won't blow you away.   But he has strong local DC ties, and spending last 3 yrs at Bama (and just winning nat'l assistant of year award moments ago) won't hurt anyone...
Special shoutout to @RazorbackFB's @coachchadmorris. Thx for opening up practice to us for our #CountryOnCampus feature on @JustinColeMoore!   ➡️ https://t.co/w8vsUmcAdX  #Razorbacks #WooPig
@Robert_Iadanza but it did make me chuckle. So there's that :)
Country music star @JustinColeMoore has an obsession. It's got zilch to do with country music.   Go 'head. Ask him about the @ArkRazorbacks.   We dare you.   👉 https://t.co/r7d2znfpq1  @cmt #CountryOnCampus 🏈
@WhyldWeasel @IBMWatson Oof. That's a tough one...
@BrianOliger I certainly hope we see Dwayne in NYC! He's flown under the radar, relative to Tua and Kyler Murray...
@MadmanMac365 Unfortunately, Mac, as long as strength of schedule is a factor, this will be a huge debate
Taking OU as final Playoff team, but tough call.   Ohio St: B1G champ, worst loss (Purdue), beat 1 of top defenses (Mich) UGA nearly beat Bama, may have best overall team of these 3, but 2 losses OU: Big 12 champ, sick off, but D that's looked sick most of season   What say you?
Whilst awaiting CFP's Final Word, trying to figure out how my fantasy lineup can survive w my stud RB on the bench 😢  Checked @IBMWatson Boom/Bust projections... whaddaya think? I got the right guys in there?  #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/MGwrNQ1uzE

@WayneTyson11 Preach, Wayne! 😊 👊 🏈
Well.  That escalated quickly.   #ACCChampionship
@miguelsepulvada @punitr Just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't... :)
Really cool to see someone who typically doesn't show any semblance of emotion... choking up talking about his backup QB...
That's some crazy Tide sh&amp;% right there, ya'll.   What a game...
HURTS... SO GOOD.
What. On. God's. Green. Earth. Was. That.  ????????????????????????????
@paigetmurphy That's actually only part of the equation. Many other metrics explored + "eye test" factors in, as well. No doubt in my mind UGA should be there, though. Most well-rounded team IMO among OU, OSU and UGA
It's hard *not* to root for Jalen Hurts.
@drewgodawgs32 Not really. Having gone through mock selection, understand all the different dynamics of conversation. Beyond what fans may expect.
@punitr Still kinda think OU needs help. If Bama rallies to win, sense UGA may still get nod by committee. Eye test = Dawgs more well-rounded team.
@tchen002 UNLESS... Clemson gets completely clocked by Pitt (doubtful, but ya never know...)
@paigetmurphy Not the injury in and of itself. How the injury has severely impacted the mobility that has been a staple in Tua's game. Not like logic matters, based on your leanings, lol... 😉
It'll be interesting to see how the selection committee views this gm, if Georgia wins.  If you were on committee, how, if at all, would you take Tua injury into consideration when assessing Dawgs' place in Playoff picture?? 🤔  #SECChampionship
@brianksmith Ah, thank you! Makes sense 😮
I don't see anything in Jaylen Waddle's Bama profile about running track in HS.  Kid should be sprinting for the Tide track team, just for kicks and giggles...  Dang, he's a burner...
@PhillysNewDrJ I don't know many too many who do that, to be honest...
@WayneTyson11 💯
Tua clearly hurt, but if Bama falls today, combine that w Kyler Murray's outing in Big 12 Champ + season stats, and don't be surprised if Heisman results are closer than you might think.   (Esp if voters heavily weigh player's overall value to team. Much greater for Murray)
Every time I see Jake Fromm put touch on the ball like that last throw, I laugh about fans calling for him to be benched after the LSU loss.   #SECChampionship
Talk about having possession baaaaaarely long enough to... have possession...  But nonetheless, Jacobs got it back.  #SECChampionship
Note to aspiring receivers:  Being able to catch the ball is important.   #Dropsies #SECChampionship
HOLY CALCATERRA, BATMAN
Everyone's railed on OU's defense all season (justifiably so).   But big plays on D in Big12 Champ help boost stock for 4th Playoff spot, as committee debates UGA/Ohio St/OU... depending on how those team play today, as well...
@morenojohn @nytimes Thx for sharing, John... :)
@DMeredith28 Well, there's prob a reason he's a Hall of Fame broadcaster and not a HOF ballplayer, lol...
@cjnewbury @slmandel Haha... good catch. I didn't even pick up on that! #GoodOlDays #ShortenTheGame 😉
@slmandel I know, right?!?!?!
WOW. Dad just shared this with me-- the Yale/Fordham baseball box score from 1947.  In CF for Fordham? Vin Scully.   At 1B for Yale? One George H.W. Bush.  #RIPGeorgeHWBush https://t.co/6lyZNpnGU2

When the #FantasyFootball standings are paper thin &amp; you'll take any edge u can get.   Apparently this not only entails using @IBMWatson Boom/Bust projections, but getting schooled by @jerryferrara in playground games. *sigh* 🤷‍♀️   #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/PPZRJN0iMG
@WickedFantasyFB Violence is never the answer. Ever.
According to TMZ article, the NFL was unable to secure hotel video of the Kareem Hunt altercation.   Yet somehow, TMZ could... and also, btw, delivered the Ray Rice video.  Perhaps the NFL (and teams) need to reconsider who's running their domestic violence investigations...

@CobaltBlu22 When I look at Coughlin back with Jax, I'm reminded of how much of an impact he had in those early years. That man is an unheralded master, imho...
.@CobaltBlu22. Never in my life would I have imagined Dan Marino being benched in a playoff game, let alone by Damon Huard. Tough to watch on sidelines.  Remem asking Danny before gm if he'd ever consider another team. He looked at me like I was nuts. And emphatically said, "no." https://t.co/hY73hdMFZo

Only Jeff Brohm knows why he's staying at Purdue. Will he get a nice salary bump? Probably.  But ultimately, you'd like to think he's truly invested in building a sustainable program in W. Lafayette. And considering the Boilers aren't top tier Big Ten, he deserves props for that.

@KingKeiff Catch what?
@coachDez76 @sciallm Incorrect, sir! A "preditor" in the TV biz is someone who is both a producer and editor.   Not a dude who plays hockey in Nashville :)

#TuesdayThoughts: Never eat blueberries right after you’ve brushed your teeth.   It’s gross.
@MadmanMac365 The fact UCF is on the outside looking in has nothing to do with money and everything to do with strength of schedule!!
@JBittensky That's ok... Points-wise, they were pretty close! 👍
@citizencope I know Mike is a NY radio host doing a NY radio show that focuses predominantly on NY sports... and very little on the national college football scene.
@simplysql Charlie Strong never had a chance in Austin... unfortunate...
@MisterGpreach I'm preaching to any fan who thinks the donation he/she makes or the tickets he/she buys entitles them to make football decisions.
@citizencope When one covers college football all over the country for networks, one's home base is superfluous.
@amazingtgrace And the reality is, Harbaugh will never has as much control in an NFL organization as he does at UM. Already been down that road. So there's no reason for him to leave.
@ImGaryCave @darrenrovell There was some leg separation, and the landing was a bit low, but he gets bonus for hurdling over a guy and pulling off a clean landing in traffic. 🤸🏼‍♀️👍
@darrenrovell No, but my knee brace probably weighed just as much, lol!

2 TDs for Melvin Gordon today.   I only wish my "questionable" days were as productive as his, lol...    #HappyFantasyOwner #Chargers
@johnnyones11 @terpsfan_nc2002 Tough to say, Johnny. Ideally you want someone with tangible HC experience. I think Les Miles woulda been great...
"Hue have been put on the Pay-No-Mind List." -- Baker https://t.co/evxgAHJoHI
@bigeastbill105 Hahahaha!! Seemed to work out ok :)
@johnhep21 It's not Joe Robbie, or the Meadowlands, either...  😉
@BmoreSportsLife @terpsfan_nc2002 Thx for the correction! Valid point, but a great recruiter does not necessarily mean a great head coach. Locksley's yet to prove the latter. Are kids gonna think they'll be competitive in the Big Ten with him at the helm?
@terpsfan_nc2002 @ivanhoe_martin Actually think Locksley and Chris Beatty would be a recruiting FORCE in DMV!
@ivanhoe_martin @terpsfan_nc2002 Any grad assistant who's worked for Saban has picked up a few things. That doesn't make him head coach material. Locksley as an OC/recruiting coordinator? 100%. HC? Not so much...
@terpsfan_nc2002 Mike Locksley is 5-57 as a head coach. Most of those games were in the Mountain West at New Mexico.  What about him makes you feel he will heal the community? Because he grew up in DC and went to Towson? Because he's the OC at Alabama where 5-stars lineup to play for Nick Saban?
@Schachter001 Seriously, @Schachter001?? He was 12-6 in his first 2 seasons with a Rose Bowl win.
I have strong opinions about fans. Big $$ boosters, in particular.    Fans are wonderful. Fans buy tickets. Fans are important.   But fans should NOT dictate whether a coach stays or goes.   If you're a real fan, go to the games, win or lose. For the love of your school. Period.
@CatbirdRed Exactly right, Victor!!
Wound up going with Rivers, @esdarrell. Sense with Melvin banged up, Philip may have to bear more of the load, ya know?? https://t.co/pkRqrD1FBb
@JBittensky OK. My @mentions have been split, but this helped me lock in Rivers. Fingers crossed!!
I get that we live in this instant gratification society, but I like Illinois' decision to extend Lovie Smith.   Continuity matters. So does patience. Esp in Urbana–Champaign, where they're not gonna land 5-star recruits year in and year out.  #Illini
@JamesDellAringa Yeah. No fun. I'm right on the fringe on the playoffs, too, so...
Help, Fantasy Tweeps!  What do I do with my QB situation today... especially keeping in mind the shaky RB situation in San Diego??  Ugh. So. Conflicted.  #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/GqurkkiPWW

Good halftime read abt Shea Patterson &amp; impact of growing up on Texas-Mexico border.   👉 https://t.co/pDEB736xVj  Line that resonated: "Sports teaches you how to get along with everybody.”  Precisely why I wish it was mandatory for every person on earth to play sports!!
Beaut of a toss from Patterson to Collins. And an even more incredible catch from Nico.   Boy, did Wolverines need that heading into the locker room...  #TheGame #UMvsOSU
You are looking LIVE at Michigan’s defense... https://t.co/wvrvSTp8mz

@BWatt_61 I’ve learned to compartmentalize personal feelings about someone from their professional talents...
@ScottMorreale That it is, Scott... that it is! 😡
True, @DavidCuse68. But I also think about the fact they’re traveling cross country, after a holiday, for an early game that kicks at 10a their time... https://t.co/1QIT0RyR2n
Messin w my fantasy lineup... desperately need a "W"  Picked up new D, but struggling w QB situation. My gut's not in sync w projections and boom/bust numbers.  Where would you lean?  #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/l3T9cDcQML
And to think just four days ago we fawned over the high scoring spectacle that was Monday Night Football...  #OUvsWVU
So weird.   No one seems to wanna take the $9M in this #TigerVSPhil thing...🤔  Happy to take that off your hands, boys...

@therealstevew I'm wired to always think big picture. Honestly, it hurts my brain sometimes, lol...
@Dofunny9 @TexasFootball Not so fast, my friend... if WVU and Texas win this weekend, that'll prob be your Big XII title game. That's why tonight's so important!
@s3friedman Negatively- how bad the OL is; positively - how Saquon's crushing his rookie year *despite* the OL :)
Out of sheer geekiness, @TheFeltyPerro, I'm just excited for the day I can use the word Shillelagh in a Scrabble game. 😉 https://t.co/0qHVWr8BYw
Respectfully disagree, @therealstevew. Fans of teams on Playoff bubble are praying WVU beats OU. Sooners D has struggled, but O is 1 of most prolific in country. If they win Big XII title and a few other dominoes fall, CFP committee's gonna have a major issue on its hands. https://t.co/fscvYg55Mf
CFB POLL: Not sure which game I'm more excited about: Oklahoma @ WVU tonite or Michigan @ Ohio St tmrw. Both have Playoff implications. And Kyler Murray + Will Grier on a national stage can boost/hamper Murray's Heisman chances vs Tua. Which game's more on your radar?? 🤔 🏈
@cmwood1372 How that’s not become an iconic staple in sports pop culture is beyond me...
@BradfatherSpeak They have... under tough circumstances... 🐢🏈
@JohnHenker_ “They are who we thought they are. And we let em off the hook!” 😂

@Jesse_Horne Ohmygosh, no. I would never sleep, lol...
I'm kinda torn.   On one hand... I really don't wanna go to bed with the score this close.   On the other, they may still be scoring when I wake up.   #MNF #KCvsLAR
Give Mahomes credit... kid has a short memory.  What a throw...
@Joemccrabb It's so true!!  Fingers crossed things will get better :)
@drewbreess Good luck finding that. You'll be looking a long time. As in, forever. I forgive your confusion!
@drewbreess What on earth are you talking about? I did no such thing. Ever.
Samson Ebukam. You're a baaaaad man.   The pride of Eastern Washington and the Big Sky Conference  Not one, but TWO defensive TDs for LA...  #KCvsLAR
@HarrisVince Lol! When I did gymnastics, you coulda put pizza in front of me, and I wouldn't have noticed (and I LOVE pizza).   If you're locked in, you tune everything else out :)
Disagree. Players shoulda already been locked in on the game.  If Hogs DBs were as focused on stopping teams from scoring as they were scoring the dancers' digits, they might be better than 2-9. https://t.co/OqXmv81Ca2

No idea what will come, if anything, of convos btwn #Browns and Condoleezza Rice for HC.   What I do know, having interviewed her multiple times (and talkin serious x&amp;o football w her) is that Cleveland would benefit greatly from Dr. Rice serving as "leadership" consultant.

The more I watch Saquon Barkley, the more I’m convinced he’s an indestructible robot, posing as a human runningback.  #NYG #Giants
Another example of a good loss, IMO, @BeckyShaddix. It was proof positive NYG's "NASCAR" pass rush package could be effective vs NE... and was a factor in them, ultimately, upending Pats in SB https://t.co/tq0etgNKqj
@Bud_Nuggets @bsmithballas @Alex_VegasREI Actually, history has nothing to do with a Playoff bid
Came oh-so-close to knockin off @JohnCUrschel 1st time ‘round...   Today’s strategy? Let Watson lead the way... and hope my bulging muscles will have a 6’3” ex- O lineman running for his life.  I mean, c’mon. What can go wrong? 😂  #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner @IBMSports https://t.co/jaoFZJMuKH
@BillSundheim @TerpsFootball True, but also linked to the tough stuff. May want to clean house, more for “optics” and recruiting...
@AdamDubr Recruiting last 2 yrs has been terrific. Curious to see how the challenges from this season impact that over next few yrs. But I hope you’re right!
@noahsyken @TerpsFootball That was right up there w Dana Holgorsen doing the same w WVU vs Texas a cpl wks back...
@KingKeiff @ChrisNowinski1 Agree. Hope other teams in NFL/other sports follow suit
@Alex_VegasREI If OSU can pull the upset (convincingly), it will def help their Playoff chances! But between UM's rock solid D this year and Patterson's continual growth in the system, it's a tall order...
@davidrhode Agreed, David. That did not help OSU's resume, that's for sure...
Thanks for havin us, @JayBarker7. Will be a fun addition to our Country on Campus piece about you and Wifey!  Great mtg you, @KerryAdams, and @LarsAnderson, I'll be anxiously waiting for your teaching syllabus to hit my inbox 😊 #RTR https://t.co/J7UMKqZp8Q
@cmwood1372 Wish I was there!
@WayneTyson11 @ChrisNowinski1 Thank you, sir :)
@davidrhode To be honest, they're not really in the conversation right now. That could change, however, if they annihilate Michigan next week and blow out N'Western in B1G title game.
@tseeks67 @TerpsFootball Wonderful school... hope they become Terps, too! Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
This move is so much bigger than the NFL...  If the manliest of men can be comfortable seeking help for mental health issues, hopefully it will help destigmatize therapy all together. There is no shame!  Thx for this piece, @ChrisNowinski1 https://t.co/rnzZWrSYom
@tseeks67 @TerpsFootball Thx! My experience there as a student-athlete laid the foundation for the wonderful career I'm blessed to have. Forever grateful and loyal 🐢
@tseeks67 @TerpsFootball The tragedy had nothing to do with the players.
Some don't believe in a "good loss." I do.   What Maryland nearly pulled off today vs Ohio St today? Amazing.  They've tragically lost a teammate. Lost their head coach. And yet, have never lost faith in EACH OTHER. As a Terp, so proud of these young men. 🐢   @TerpsFootball
@dameas I'll take it!
@1buckeyetom Interesting. All of the other feedback I've gotten is that Maryland played really well, had the guts to go for 2 in OT, and just fell short. Perhaps consider giving credit where credit's due?
@SteveYancey3 They have one. Unfortunately, he's out for the year with an ACL 😢
@mikeinbama Yup! Could not have been a more perfect day!!

So heartbroken for #Terps QB Kasim Hill. To work as hard as he has to come back from injury, only to be sidelined, again, with an ACL... ugh 😢  Get well soon, @Khillqb11!! 🐢 #TerpLove
Ok, folks. TD Dance-Off time.  Me or @jerryferrara. Who gets your vote?   Any good @IBMWatson fantasy stories on your end?    #VeryPunny #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/mcuqCYz6tL
Watching Jets-Bills right now, because it’s the only game on in New York.  And I keep coming back to one singular thought:  @Espngreeny must be absolutely inconsolable right now. 😉
@Guidopolis Not if you have the Jets defense in your fantasy league, lol... 🤷‍♀️

@ScottKerfien You putting "27" in my @mentions just bought into focus how long I've been out of college. That was my senior year! 😃
@michaeldalyTX @MagicJohnson Way, lol!!
Maybe, just MAYBE, @FarrJL07 you can stop assuming ppl's tweets always have racial intent behind them.   1 of Magic Johnson's trademarks, before he was ever a Hall of Famer &amp; extraordinarily successful businessman, was his smile. The only place it's a race thing is in your head. https://t.co/PdlSNNcpxJ
On this day in 1991, @MagicJohnson retired from NBA, diagnosed HIV positive.   I was interning for George Michael's Sports Machine at time. We were doing a feature on Magic. Presser put a pit in my stomach.   Fast fwd-&gt; 2018. Magic thriving. Always w that trademark smile. 🙏
@MichieMou5 Great to hear!

Ok. So, dumb question: Did Michael Thomas stash cell phones underneath both goalposts?  Curious minds... 🤔   #Saints #TDDance #PhoneItIn #LARvsNO
@DreJaxBx @CharlesWoodson @IBMWatson @IBMSports He didn’t. Fortunately, most everyone else did...

@thebdc_scott I would say that for any school going through crisis, where student-athletes are unfairly impacted. And did for Penn State.
Came thiiis close to takin @Stephania_ESPN last wk, despite projections she'd crush me, lol.   @IBMWatson clutch w player Boom/Bust recommendations that paid off... curious, fantasy Tweeps... how's your experience been w Watson? Helpful? Do you use it?  #IBMPartner #WinWithWatson
@NicoleAuerbach The more important question is... did you participate?  Putting you in charge of getting everyone in the press box on board... :)
@MasonSF49ers No apology necessary!! Emotions running high right now, understandably. Thx for supporting the team 🐢

@metfan722 Ummm... he’s 45. I don’t even think a daily serving of Tom Brady’s avocado ice cream will buy him 10 more yrs :)
Today, Adam Vinatieri became the NFL’s all-time leading scorer.  I don’t care that he’s a kicker.  He’s a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Period.   Those Blanda, Groza, Stenerud and Anderson busts will have company... 5 yrs after Vinateri retires.

@chrisbontempo @JohnCUrschel Haha... I dunno. @JohnCUrschel, what say you??
@Bruin238 @JohnCUrschel From an historical standpoint, of course. But Brady was playing a solid Bears defense... and Dalton was playing KC's D, which is meh.
@MrWinston23 @JohnCUrschel Ah, yes... important nugget!   3-RB PPR league 😊
Holy smokes. Just checked scoreboard.   Actually have a (small) shot at taking down Goliath tonite! (@JohnCUrschel is our lone undefeated fantasy owner)  Ever seen a scenario this tight heading into MNF, with 1 star left to play for each team?!?  Nuts... https://t.co/YGdX2O2Mub

If you know Pat Fitzgerald at all, if you've been around him, or watched him coach his players, or observed his integrity... you'd understand why it's nearly impossible not to root for #Northwestern.  Michigan fans (today) notwithstanding.

@SethDavisHoops @notthefakeSVP @DanHellie @JBsportscaster Between Glenn, Warner and George, the DC market has had some hi-level characters 😂
Incredible reaction to post below... some really fascinating (and diverse) responses!   Thx to all of my Tweeps for taking the time to share... https://t.co/zdYJb9GE3P
@DrTestudo He may not get drafted at all
@DavidVorpe65 Perhaps, but chemistry w your receivers is not a given, nor is the quality of your skill players and OL. QBs are nothing without supporting cast
@EDHaynesIII Could def be interesting.  Wonder if his mindset is “contenders only”... or “cool diff school experience where I’ll get to play”
@yothisisdre True. And the mindset of the athlete in 2018 is a lot different than the mindset of the athlete 10-15 yrs ago...
@kobie173 Grad transfers can play right away!
@Richard14407640 OU interesting. UW, no way. Southern boy + Huskies unlikely to be in mix for championship.
@kdubbs36 Don't necessarily agree with that. He waited his turn to start... battled thru injuries. Like I said, struggling with this one...
@gpatterson9 Dabo truly is the gold standard. But honestly, don't think there are a ton of HCs who would intentionally screw over a kid like that (at least I hope not...)
@HarrisVince Correct. New rule allows you to play in 4 games and still redshirt. And bc he's a grad student, he can transfer and play immediately
@RobbieThompson2 Worked out well for Russell Wilson :)
@PhillysNewDrJ I've seen him a fringe NFL prospect, at best...
Struggling to figure out how I feel abt Clemson QB Kelly Bryant transferring after losing his gig.  Totally his right, of course. But only a handful of schools have a realistic shot of a championship. He has to learn new system/new personnel. Is it worth it?  What do u think?
@RussDlin @jetsyanks06 Thx, Russ!
@TheGunzShow And that wasn’t even 7/8a hour!!
I’m astounded at how many people are on a NYC subway train at 6:30 in the morning.  Get after it, people!  I❤️NY https://t.co/jM5v9si1Y9
@CountDownDave @CharlesWoodson Yes. Him! To think he’s still the only Heisman winner to date whose primary position was defense blows my mind
Hail to *this* Victor!!!!  cc: Mr. @CharlesWoodson 🏈 🎉 https://t.co/ZfWteutPLV
@DustinCharles11 @MaryFranceslaw2 @dustinlynch @CMT @FloridaGators Mary, this is a fake account. Dustin's verified account is @dustinlynch
Ain't got no college/pro FB championship ring. Or a bust waitin in the college HoF.   BUT-- I'll hold today's fantasy win (thx, Watson!) + this epic vid over @CharlesWoodson for all eternity.  And that's... spectacular. 😂   #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/p5K9xvWCma
@kwhite2222 Oof. 70?? 40 for me...
@mn2fitness @JordyRNelson I few ppl have told me this!
When @JordyRNelson finished the day with 29.3 fantasy points.  And you’re the jackwagon who left him on your bench. Smh...  #Raiders #RaiderNation https://t.co/KonVpKfA6P
First time Kentucky (#17) lands in AP Top 20 football poll since 2007.   They gonna upend Georgia (Bama not on sked this year)?  Unlikely.   Doesn't matter. Just always nice to see fresh faces in the polls.  And a different Stoops 🏈
@JeffCuttell That makes me feel a little better, I guess :)
Dear World:  Please understand what #Chiefs Patrick Mahomes is doing right now is not normal.   Please do not raise expectations of your QB, any other NFL QB, or any future NFL QB.  With respect,  Reality
@miguelsepulvada You, Mike, are much smarter than I.
Jordy Nelson's decided to have himself a day.  While sitting on my bench.   🤦‍♀️  #Raiders #OAKvsMIA
@cowboytroy REEEEEEEEEAL serious.  Like, Do-Not-Mess-Wit-Dis serious :)
Pat Mahomes, ladies and gentlemen... 👀 😮
.@eryanobrien Thank you, oh Wise Watson One.   Stuck with him! https://t.co/ckth9PiKRg
@gkorwan @CharlesWoodson Haha... I obsess over everything 😁
Help, please, Fantasy Tweeps!  0-2 so far 😢 Gotta step it up this week vs. @CharlesWoodson!  Struggling w my kicker situation...  take a look at Watson’s boom/bust projections...who should I take??    #WinWithWatson #IBMPartner https://t.co/eK83Cgr7IX
@PizzaDinklage Hmmm... not sure. @ESPNFantasy, can you drop some knowledge here?
Sunday Fantasy FB Poll: been using Watson data on ESPN Fantasy app to help w lineups/player swaps. New kicker/defense this wk!   How about u... has it helped? Not tried Watson yet?  Would love your feedback (with poll + reply, too, with other thoughts!) 🏈 💻
@marcusup1st @JeffCardozoUF @CMT Thank u 🙏
@NicoleAuerbach Ok. Let’s not go supplanting hoops just yet 😉
@AmyTrask Haha. Of COURSE you’d be right on top of this! 👋
If Stanford winds up pulling off this game, the band should really come on the field or something cool.  Oh, wait...  #Stanford #STANvsUO
That was a pro-level lookoff by Herbert right there...  #STANvsUO
My perpetual conundrum on CFB Saturday nights:  A good game's a dud early.   I start thinkin I can go to bed early.  Trailing team closes the gap.   Go-to-bed-early gameplan scrapped.  Dangit, Stanford! 😉  #STANvsUO
Holy smokes.  Kentucky’s beaten Florida and Mississippi State.  Yes. In football.
The ultimate example of teamwork.  https://t.co/QewqpWQVcI
Perfect emoji for Tennessee right now...   🤦‍♀️
@NWHouston Fair, but in a league that won't exactly win awards for defense, TCU is one of the better groups on that front...
@EvinWilson85 Red River just got a lil' more interesting... 👍
@PGQue Maryland's not bad. And you have to keep in mind: 1) they beat UT last year; 2) they were gameplanning for that game since July; 3) it was the team's first game after one of their teammates died from heatstroke.   Emotion is a powerful thing...
@ChuckDouglas_ Read my profile, Chuck 🐢 😀
Maryland loss aside, no one should be surprised by what we're seeing from the #Longhorns.  6-6 didn't tell last yr's story. Lotta really tight games.   You knew Tom Herman was on the verge of breaking thru...  #TCUvsUT
@CFBHeather THIS is why you make the big bucks!! 😉
@TomJohnson314 Yes! It was a pretty creative tweet, too. Grrr.  That's ok. Turpin's bound to make at least one more amazing play this year :)
.@moose6747 I've seen enough. Bama's stacked. At pretty much every position.   They probably go 5 deep at water bottle carrier. https://t.co/9BYyRiVJq6
@JohnCUrschel It’s not you.  It’s me.   And my mathematical ineptitude. 😂
@brettshep43 You seem lovely, Brett.  But my fingers are crossed that’s alcohol talkin... 😂
8 second’s later, Tua puts it in the end zone.  Hunker down, Aggie fans... may be a loooooong day... https://t.co/6lI4oH7OTW
42 seconds into the Bama-Texas A&amp;M game, and the Tide’s got an INT.  Oy.  #TAMUvsBAMA
Flipped on @BigTenNetwork juuuuust in time for @RayyyMoneyyy's end zone pick vs Minnesota.  That's what I like. 🐢🐢🐢  #GoTerps
@sash19xu @JeffCardozoUF @CMT @dariusrucker @garthbrooks Excellent choices!
Thanks to @JeffCardozoUF and to all who've been spreading the 💗 for our @CMT series, Country on Campus. Means the world to me!  WATCH --&gt; https://t.co/N6PC5SSwHq  What other artists would you like to see profiled? Want your suggestions! https://t.co/JnznhOKSKE
@OrangeChuck Agreed. It’s so much easier to be kind than mean!
Tell you what: today's #GoogleDoodle celebrating Mr. Rogers absolutely made my day! Totally worth your time (esp young Tweeps who have no idea who Mr. Rogers is) --&gt;  https://t.co/DAvwnPnDWR   *sigh* Those days were so much simpler...
Awww, thanks, @Browncargo! WMDT @47abc was so important to building my journalistic foundation.   Funny enough, first live shot ever for them was on top of CNN building in DC... about gerrymandering of Maryland districts. Will never forget that day! https://t.co/ieWg0EbgIs
@JeffCaves Haha! It's not for the faint of heart... or homers 😉
@ktask9 Don't recall it that way. Belichick called Randy 1 of smartest receivers he ever coached. He left over money. Dillon just got old.
New England is perfect place for Josh Gordon.   If anything can inspire a player w his physical gifts to stay clean, it's #Patriots' history of success &amp; locker room leadership.   Those who've worn out their welcome elsewhere (i.e.- Randy Moss, Corey Dillon) can attest.
@Ga_Jason Haha! As a fan, I totally get that!  But in that situation, he's a reporter, not a fan. Distinct difference, ya know?
@BillGroner1 I try... thank you :)
.@jetsyanks06 You do realize, Louis, that you sent this reply to someone whose career blossomed as a sideline reporter.   And who you CHOSE follow.   All by yourself. https://t.co/759FxXPTpf
@Ga_Jason How so?
Reminder, kids: objectivity is paramount as a sideline reporter.   No matter how much of a fan you are, leave that behind the stadium gates.  No matter how strong your ties to the team... you are not *part* of the team.   You cover the team. https://t.co/wQKAjoXK8w
Thanks, @corby_kevin!   #KeepItSimple https://t.co/4kP6WPtU28
One is a mathematical genius.   The other is completely clueless, but thankfully has Watson on #ESPNs fantasy app to help set lineups every week.    Yes, I'm comfortable enough in my own skin to be this vulnerable on camera.  cc: @JohnCUrschel 😂  #WinWithWatson https://t.co/C5aRYDhW7q
@Airgator007 @CMT @dustinlynch @TimTebow @SteveSpurrierUF @CollinsworthPFF Ohmygosh... 7 minutes is an eternity these days! (that said, we prob coulda pumped out a 30 min piece on Dustin’s experience...)

@LauraOkmin @KerithBurke @annkillion @SarahSpain I remember something my mom told me yrs ago (w the caveat that when you're younger, it's more challenging to feel ok with this, bc you're just trying to get a job): If someone doesn't hire you because of your last name, or how you dress, you probably don't want to work for them.
Don’t typically put much stock in Week 2 match-ups... but Jacksonville taking down the Pats for the first time in the Brady era *and* avenging the AFC Championshil loss?  &lt;Insert monkey hopping off Jaguar back here&gt;  #Jags https://t.co/RCvCskRghY
@SlickVic5446 Lots and lots! Half of the NFL's fan base is... women :)
@JetPhan72 It certainly does. It tells us two games mean absolutely nothing about the long term viability of a player.   No name calling here. #BeBetter
Tell you what:  After 3 straight weeks of traveling insanity, I've sat on the couch the last 2 days and done nothing but watch football.  Heaven on earth. 💗 🏈
Cleveland Browns are the living, breathing version of Murphy's Law.  If it can go wrong, it will. Smh...
@Scott_CPO Jets fans don't have a plethora of feel good seasons to work with. They remember the Super Bowl, the Broadway Joe glitz and the fur coats.   Not career TD-INT differential 😊
Whatever Pat Mahomes had for breakfast this morning...  I'll take double.   10 TD's in 2 weeks... whooooeeee. #Chiefs
@WayneTyson11 Wayne! A voice of reason on social media! Thank you... 😊
@dbearak That's fair. I just reserve judgement on anyone until there's a big enough body of work to judge. None of us has any idea how he'll be. And... a lot of that, quite frankly, depends on the reliability of his supporting cast
I just watched the Darnold red zone pick again.   For all ya'll who were screaming "next Joe Namath!" after Week 1, please, for the sake of your health, slow your roll. #Jets
@ChrisGallowayOH 😂 🤣  I want the Browns to be good. I'm a lifelong Mets fan. I feel your pain.
Not sure whether Browns being on pace to take down Saints in New Orleans is super encouraging for Cleveland... or a crazy bad omen for the Saints...  (Probably both.)
@s3friedman @IBMWatson You get a shoutout, but so does everyone else who made the same recommendation you did (which was, like, pretty much everyone, lol) 😉

Today’s Fantasy QB conundrum: deciding btwn Cam Newton &amp; Philip Rivers. Don’t love Rivers traveling cross country for 1p gm, but opp def not huge threat. Newton higher “Boom” projection, per @IBMWatson, but higher “bust” projection, too.  Ack! What do I do?  #IBMPartner https://t.co/68xIXacNSV
What a cool piece by @SalPal_ESPN about the origin of the Philly Special. Born on the high school field, executed in college, pulled outta the #Eagles’ bag of tricks in the Super Bowl.   Bravo, Sal— post online, please!
.@adnanESPN Just know... College Football Final gets DVR’d every week, my friend.  Holding you to this 😃 #TCU #Reagor https://t.co/ValZyLiiWL
Good news about Bama being up 49-7 on Ole Miss at the half is that I don’t need to wear my remote out switching back and forth btwn the OSU-TCU game 😉
If Jalen Reagor doesn’t make SC Top 10 with that 1-handed beauty, Urban Meyer’s spending his last “suspension” game hijackng ESPN’s edit bays.  #OSUvsTCU

@MartyinDE Due respect, Marty, you've *chosen* to view this as a "comparison" tweet. It's clearly not. The causation is different in each.   But there are commonalities (not to be confused with "comparisons"): All were terrible. All set Maryland back. All could have been prevented.

@Bigprolo Obviously not an indictment of the entire athletic dept, Gerard.
@waynejefferys12 Indeed, Antonio. @LinkedInWalt Wizard was the man...
@tony_torchia Motives have neither substance nor impact without facts behind them.
I arrived at Maryland 2 yrs after Len Bias' death. With campus still reeling, Bob Wade's NCAA violations crippled our athletic dept.   Now, a player dies on Durkin's watch. Reports of despicable treatment of players.   We must make impactful change. Now. This can't happen again.

Baker Mayfield with a sweet throw for TD #2 in his NFL debut.   What do you guys think about Baker and Saquon's first appearances?  #CLEvsNYG #Giants #Browns

Methinks South Carolina superfan @dariusrucker just took a Clemson hat from someone in the audience, pretended to wipe his bum with it and tossed it back (with a huge smile, of course)  For as great as this concert was, that made my night.   College football’s almost back! 😁 🏈

@tony_torchia All the more reason I'd imagine you'd feel differently (and I'm very sorry to hear about your experience)  But, of course, we are all entitled to our opinions, and I respect yours :)
@tony_torchia It's absolutely not. Coaches, esp HS/college coaches, are often father figures to their athletes. Let's take OSU out of this... If a coach, *any* coach, physically abuses, or enables another coach to physically abuse, you want that person around your kid? Setting that example?
@tony_torchia Do you have children who play sports?
@gator4life0601 Not hard to imagine. But you can't put that genie back in the bottle.
@mightymac1963 @WatchStadium LISTEN to the interview, Michael. She *didn't* want her husband to be fired. And she didn't blame Urban for anything.
Lotta facts/evidence still to be gathered regarding what Urban Meyer knew abt Zach Smith's alleged domestic abuse &amp; when he knew it.   But these texts will be a part of it.   And it's hard to imagine a wife keeping this quiet from her husband.   (texts via @WatchStadium) https://t.co/OFfq6nW3vD

@mlorenzen @markschlereth 2 diff conversations. Repeated head trauma can cause CTE. Alcohol addiction can cause cognitive changes/exacerbate mental illness, which obv is brain-related. All have been linked to suicide. Each person's case is unique. Often hard to isolate 1 factor.
@davehobbs78 @markschlereth 👍
@davehobbs78 @markschlereth Please don't use the term "media" like we're one big groupthink, Dave.   It's simply inaccurate. Stink and I are living proof on this topic 😊
Agree w @markschlereth-- more research needed on role drugs, alcohol, depression/mental illness may play in CTE.   But then there's Tyler Hilinski's suicide. Docs said at 21, he had brain of 65 yr-old bc of CTE. And none of issues listed above.  Makes you wonder... #LarryFedora https://t.co/WC4UBWyKhX

@BrainofBrian428 @hopesolo It’s actually not. Our women are more prominent in campaigns for national advertisers than our men. And, by and large, more recognizable by the general public.
@rudedogreyes @morenojosea Thx for your thoughts, Rudy 🙂
@williamorr2110 @squidbilly929 Hmm... Not sure I agree there, William. Polarizing? Yes. Could she use more tempered language? Of course. But can’t imagine traveling the globe as an activist if you’re simply looking for attn. You can do that at home. With a Twitter post, ya know?
@morenojosea @rudedogreyes Wouldn’t immediately think there’d be a downside to bilingual coaches. Interesting
@Galloots Thank you. Wanna get it into right hands. Would be great to know club level, tourney/game locations, flight vs drive, hotel costs, etc., as well as tourney registration fees, kit costs, etc. Appreciate you taking the time. Lemme know when it’s ready to go!
@abfowler4 Thanks for taking 43 mins out of your day to watch. Appreciate it
@3105group Speaking from experience, my dad worked his tail off to be able to cover my training. My parents sacrificed a lot. I’d say easily over 15k/yr, and nothing remotely close to “luxury travel”
@dTrollinguy @hopesolo Japan’s nominal GDP is #3 in the world behind the US and China. #FactsMatter
@morenojosea @rudedogreyes She said she came across some clubs that required coaches to speak Spanish, with hopes of getting kids involved. Thought that was encouraging, but obv just one small step
@Galloots I’d love to see those numbers! Would be a fantastic case study of how to compete inexpensively at the highest levels of club soccer. If you’re able to provide that information, lemme know
@dTrollinguy @darrenrovell @hopesolo @KyleUSC1 You do realize the US Women’s National Team is the reigning World Cup Champ and has won gold in 3 of last 4 Olympics, right?  Oh, wait... #FactsMatter
@morenojosea @rudedogreyes Thx for sharing, Jose. Curious- what’s your take on Hope’s opinion US Soccer has alienated Latino communities? Appreciate your perspective here...
@Galloots The only way that math could possibly work is if you drive 5 hours to a game and drive back afterwards. If you fly/stay at hotel/pay for food, etc, this claim is impossible for a full season.
@Galloots Not if you’re on a travel team
@optimalwc Of course! But that doesn’t cover travel, does it?
As the person who conducted Hope Solo intrvw getting attn, some context:  •$15k/yr cost to play soccer =  travel teams. Not your local rec club.   •"Rich white sport" comment comes from her frustration w USSF, which she doesn't feel adequately supports youth soccer/dev leagues
@darrenrovell @DanWetzel I sense the more important issue she raises is how much does USSF reinvest in identifying very best talent, and providing resources to support/develop those athletes, esp kids whose families can't afford the cost of training, travel, etc
Jameis Winston accepts 3-gm suspension for Uber driver incident, which, initially, he vehemently denied ever happened.  This statement, though... when will lawyers/publicists learn how to craft messaging that at least resembles the athlete’s voice?  Authenticity matters. https://t.co/pM8YVA8A8H
When you wonder who the hell comes up with all these National-So-And-So days, then find a quote to justify posting about it... https://t.co/B9bMfpdMZs

@gkops62 Grown men making millions need someone to motivate them?
Raptors fire Dwane Casey, the coach who produced the team's only 3 50+ win seasons.   Should they, like, fire the entire team?
Ok. Feel better now.   Trivia question in previous tweet didn’t seem right. Googled it. It’s incorrect, @TriviaCrack! Might wanna pull it from your inventory...  https://t.co/rI32VUNVZv

@GarysOldTown Forgiveness is a wonderful quality :)
Can’t quite put my finger on it, but this just seems to feel right... 😉  https://t.co/4qIf0ArbmB  @sammysteinlight @amy_scheer
@GarysOldTown @hqtrivia @ScottRogowsky Ok. Well, then, maybe he dreams of being old enough to have remembered the last time we could say “Mets” and “World Champions” in the same sentence. Without laughing to the point of hyperventilation. 😉
Do I have any @hqtrivia Tweeps?  Heard @ScottRogowsky mention Matt Harvey’s Mets demise 2nite... then, thru the almighty power of Google, discovered we have the same #1 childhood sports memory. 😃  (Think 1986... Mookie Wilson... and that slippery lil white ball...)
@Shmoooo Ummm... pretty sure that was 4 or 5 models ago...

@Louisville_rule Just remember... Tom Brady was a 6th round pick 😁  Give the kid a chance. Judge not on projection, but actual body of work...
@orlandoenomo See your point, and kinda agree... but in today's day and age, many judge one's willingness to merely repeat offensive words attributed to others.
@fbv2230 Very interesting, Fred... thank you! I'm surprised Wisconsin's not on there...
@fbv2230 Interesting. Curious- Where is that number coming from and how does that compare to other states, I wonder...
@bigeastbill105 That should be next priority
@JerseyTerp @CoachDurkin I'd be ok with that 🐢💚
@Da6ixJamal Thank you! Although we'll agree to disagree. Allen's toughness dwarfs Rosen's. That matters in Buffalo. A lot.
@RJG101752 Lovely. Except I'm from NJ, not PA :)
@StinaSternberg That's unfortunate. I think I'd really enjoy the Barkley Bop. 😂
@ninaneddieanto Hope you're right. Schiano was moving in that direction before he left for TB...
@_WeAreND_ @RBCCaseys @CBALincroft @NotreDame @BigQ56 Haha... totally get this!! As a public school kid, I wasn't a fan of either, lol  (I kid, I kid. Although RBC was a great gymnastics rival...)
@StinaSternberg Video, or it didn't happen...
Two Jersey kids in the first 11 picks of the draft.   Just sayin. 🙌   #QuentonNelson #MinkahFitzpatrick #JerseyStrong #NFLDraft @minkfitz_21 @BigQ56
@tmlaw1 Character is determined by consistent behavior over the course of time.
Hue Jackson says Baker will be holding a clipboard, learning from Tyrod Taylor.   Because, like, what else is he gonna say about a dude who hasn't even stepped foot in the locker room yet?   #Browns #NFLDraft
@MTillbilly If Rutgers had a nationally renown journalism program, a Top 25 gymnastics team and they offered me a full ride, I would have seriously considered it 😊
@DG_G11 You are 100% right, Danny!
I get why lots of folks were upset by Josh Allen's immature, inappropriate high school tweets. Deservedly so.  But when the Bills did their risk assessment-- the size, the arm, the accuracy, the mobility, the fact he's weather-tested? No brainer.   #Bills #NFLDraft
Quenton Nelson. From Red Bank Catholic (NJ) to Notre Dame to 1st round pick for the Colts.   As a fellow Monmouth County girl, love seeing Nelson succeed... while continuing to wonder if Rutgers will ever be able to consistently keep talented kids home.  #NFLDraft @RBCCaseys
Bradley Chubb/Von Miller in Denver.  Good luck, Godspeed, AFC West offenses.   #NFLDraft #Broncos
@StokeTheFire Stats can be misleading... lotta factors come into play! I watched him a bunch, saw incredible footwork, mindboggling balance, adeptness at route-running and pass pro, and brute strength.
@CheddarDarth Per ESPN Stats: Darnold went 5-1 when gametime temps were &lt; 60 degrees. TD-INT differential =13/5...  QBR = 90
Sam Darnold, the latest USC quarterback to go to the Jets.   People forget Mark Sanchez had early success for Gang Green.   Let's hope the latest Trojan has more sustained success.  #Jets #NYJ #NFLDraft
Put Saquon Barkley's incredibly well-rounded game aside...  With all of the personality/attitude challenges with OBJ, Saquon will be a breath of fresh air for the Giants. And Giants fans.   Consummate professional. 24/7. Win or lose.   #Giants #NFLDraftNews
SAQUON!!!!  #Giants #NFLDraft #NumbahTwo https://t.co/yCdemb0SwQ
Twice a college walk-on. Now the NUMBER ONE pick in the NFL Draft.   What an incredible journey for Baker Mayfield... #Browns #NFLDraft
Oh, come ON, people. Let's go already...  #NFLDraft2018
@Bklyn_Born412 There's a really cool concept. It's called trading up.
@CheddarDarth Not this year. Saquon is a more special talent than any of this yr’s QBs, imho
#NFLDraft2018 Poll: Who do you think will be the first QB to go tonight?
@clintscroggs Meh. But interestingly enough, Barkley’s unusually adept at pass blocking for a young guy and could be an asset there...
Dear @Giants:  Please, please, pretty please take Saquon Barkley.  #NFLDraft2018 https://t.co/BYBHUi7tz5

After watching LeBron/Allie LaForce intervw from last night, suspect it was LBJ's surprised reaction that has ppl assuming he was caught off guard with Popovich wife question.   He wasn't. Said so himself. LaForce asked permission to inquire. He said yes. End of story.
.@PJ_LSU Per LeBron's video, @ALaForce asked LBJ prior to intrvw if he was ok with Pop wife question--&gt; https://t.co/vzN46LvK2v  Based on close relationship btwn LBJ/Pop, totally professional, warranted question. What's your issue? https://t.co/T4p15L0cyl

@MatthewHalko Fascinating question, Matthew. Can’t imagine there are any barriers, as long as, as you said athlete’s not using any university/conference logos/marks. That said, those instances are prob rare...
@lonestarball In a sport like FB, where physical development is paramount to success in pros, kids need college to achieve that. In hoops, we know seldom few (when it was allowed) went straight from HS to NBA and had sustainable careers.

@Naiveberserk Interesting question, Kevin. And I have complicated thoughts 😊. Percentage of licensed merch? Don’t agree. But if a kid wants to start a business and sell autographed items or monetize YouTube vids he/she creates, there’s an entrepreneurial element to that I think’s ok
@CBus660R Power 5 schools across the board implemented stipends a couple yrs ago to cover “cost of attendance” 😊
@CBus660R And how would schools decide who does/doesn’t get paid?
On #NationalStudentAthleteDay, keepin it real about whether college athletes should get paid.  They shouldn’t. Here’s why:  https://t.co/4eqC9Mdomp

@CanioCostanzo Not entirely true, because conference tournament champions get auto bids to tournament, not regular season champs. And that often impacts the at-large slots
@bbison724 Nope. We were a charter member of the ACC. Having a really tough time loathing Ohio State (Or anyone in B1G) as much as I was conditioned to hate Duke 😉
@helmick_michael It’s very hard to say that, Michael, because strong conferences cannibalize themselves. More than anything, the “eye test” is often the most important “metric”... but it doesn’t resonate w fans as well as statistics, ya know?
“It’s an all-ACC Sweet 16 match-up in Omaha... Duke and Syracuse!” -Ian Eagle.  I don’t care how long Cuse is in the ACC... my old school, traditionalist brain will always consider them Big East, lol
@cobra640 Agree w that
Win or lose... Syracuse with a 3 pt lead on Michigan State with 8 secs left justifies the committee’s decision to pull the Orange in from the bubble.  #MarchMadness

As a fmr student-athlete, what bothers me most abt all this corruption in hoops (and CFB, let's not kid ourselves) is that it casts a dark shadow over college athletics, as a whole... the opportunity to develop eternal bonds &amp; life skills that tee you up for success as an adult.
Just read @YahooForde @PeteThamel's piece detailing at least a dozen high profile college hoops programs + 25 players named in FBI sting: https://t.co/HQmzyj4kNZ   POLL: Do you, the fan, care if players/their fams are getting $$ and perks under the table? (reply w thoughts, too!)
.@jzzza This is not "corporate". This is the person presiding over 30 NBA teams saying, "Enough is enough, I'm making sure of it."  And Adam Silver's record as commissioner is irrefutably rock solid. https://t.co/Q5PKGbdHC9
This is so important. People subjected to inappropriate behavior need an independent resource. A place to turn where they know their voices will be heard... and reports will be taken seriously.  Sadly, HR is often place where complaints go to die.   Bravo, Commissioner. #NBA https://t.co/M3aedQ01WB

Seeing reports Ohio St. AHC/DC Greg Schiano may be heading to Patriots. Cld be perfect place for him, post-Tennessee fiasco.   Schiano/Belichick grew close when BB's son played at Rutgers. And Belichick (if he stays) won't give 2 &lt;beeps&gt; about public opinion...
@JeffAichinger Ummm... Belichick gave his word to Jets, bailed, and then won a whole bunch of rings in New England, sooooo...
@MitchPerfection They, sadly, do what lots of orgs do. Bring in someone. Check the box. Move on.
Perfect storm in New England that coulda justified Josh McDaniels sitckin around:   --Fractured Brady/Belichick relationship --#Patriots losing Super Bowl --Belichick getting roasted for not playing Malcolm Butler  If there's a logical time to start a new era, it may be now.
Holy smokes. Multiple reports Josh McDaniels doing an about face. Won't go to Colts, staying w Patriots.  Why do I think there's a napkin floating around Indy...  "I resign as the HC of IND." ??
@TeamShuster @PriceAtkinson @MattJamilton I love getting all of my curling updates from your RTs, Price :)

@MichaelSantang5 You might wanna come off the drugs. Or the delusion, bud. Create your own narrative, if you must. Just don't include me.
Some perspective:  We now have a former grocery store bagger (Kurt Warner) and a guy who nearly left the game to become a pastor (Nick Foles) who have "Super Bowl MVP" on their resumes.   Kids: dream big. Anything is possible.

Could not agree more, @johnprout3. Every woman who's has the courage to speak, no matter how many came before her, or how long ago she may have been victimized, is a hero in my book. Many don't understand the emotional fortitude required to go public with these stories. #Nassar https://t.co/ne50WZVYYT
@huntsvut @emtfr Hard core proof or a lead I could pursue? No, sir. But very hopeful the public nature of cases like Sandusky/Nassar empower victims to feel safe sharing their stories sooner, knowing their claims will be taken seriously and be investigated, rather than dismissed.
.@AlmostRPagel Very grateful to be able to say, emphatically, no. "Tough love" coaches in club, but never any sexual misconduct. And my college coach was as good of a person as you'll find.   That said, doesn't make these cases any less heartbreaking. https://t.co/sITTYZkr9E
And so, it begins. At a whole different level.  #LarryNassar #MichiganState https://t.co/oyOWuHNuhE
@huntsvut @emtfr Before Sandusky case ever came to light, as a former athlete, and fairly intellectual human w an interest in psychology and understanding of how adults have the ability to manipulate children, I assumed coaches were taking advantage of young, innocent athletes. In many sports.
@TomPair2 Thank you, Tom... appreciate that 😊   Here's the very clear point: painting broad brushstrokes w any group-- race, religion, ethnicity, occupation, gender, sexual preference, you name it-- is unfair/unwarranted. There are good and bad within ALL groups. And lots of gray area...
Just now seeing @kobebryant's beautifully animated short film, "Dear Basketball" after earning an Academy Award nomination. Exquisitely done @GlenKeanePrd! ➡️  https://t.co/rnfRXRvgvr
I have grown so tired of this "you media" sentiment.   It's like saying all white people are the same. All black people. All ppl of a certain religion. Nonsense!!   STOP blaming your anger on media, folks. Look within and see how you can make a difference.
@emtfr All due respect, your advocacy does not entitle you to make uninformed, hurtful comments. As a former gymnast, I've followed this case closely since 1st reported in Indy Star, have monitored it religiously and had myriad discussions in our sports' circles. Thx for reaching out
Well, @emtfr, actually been speaking to people in the know all day about it. All of whom feel the very same way.   But then again, that you feel the Nassar case doesn't touch sports, MSU or the NCAA is equal parts alarming and laughable. https://t.co/ZZXh7qGaLm
Michigan St. trustee Joel Ferguson says Lou Anna Simon is best prez school's had in his 30 yrs on board.  "So much more going on at university than this 'Nassar thing.'"  "Nassar thing?" Can you possibly be more tone deaf?
@kdharris21 @USAGym @michiganstateu It *is* a huge deal. Massive publicity. Not just sports, but nat'l news headlines. Cameras capturing 100+ victims speaking to Nassar. Karolyi gym axed as Nat'l Training Ctr. USAG execs resigning. Sweeping changes ahead to create safer/healthier experience for athletes.
#TuesdayThoughts Mentoring is 1 of the best ways to pay it forward &amp; something I truly enjoy.   Tackled some challenging topics last night at @WISENYC event. Any advice you can share? ➡️    https://t.co/m95VR4KVAw
@kdharris21 @USAGym @michiganstateu You're kidding, right? Football program at PSU nearly got the death penalty. Administrators/coaches were fired/brought into court. Sandusky's in jail for the rest of this life. Story garnered nat'l headlines for months.  Your spin is your choice. Not reality. And I'm a gymnast.

@myost73 *cymbal crash*
I worked sideline the last time the Eagles and Patriots met in the Super Bowl (2005).   Terrell Owens somehow played on an ankle w a couple screws in it. NE was losing both its coordinators.  Wash, rinse, repeat on that last part...
@FlyKfcm May I remind you, he's shredding 1 of the league's best defenses...
@MichaelDendor Hard for me to answer, because I'm a big Bradford fan. Unfortunately, his body's not built to withstand the punishment of the sport.
@danielyp29 Lol, right?!?

Must be so fun for Howie Long to have been on the sidelines to see his son make that play...   #Eagles #NFCChampionshipGame
Jacksonville may be done. But the definition of "Bortling" should be put to bed.   Guy played his ass off today. And in the playoffs.   Congrats, @Jaguars, on an incredible season. Bright future...

@Jennmombomb Yes, ma'am! Most kids play both sides of the ball in HS... very few can do it with the proficiency Myles could in college. Special young man :)
@vinsane38 Really nice kid, too...
@Ballentine1037 I can say and do a lot of things, lol... personal choice 😊
If you didn't watch Myles Jack in college, you don't know what a freak he is.   Jim Mora would just throw him in at RB at #UCLA w zero reps and he'd make impact plays with ease...   #Jags #AFCChampionshipGame

@Richard14407640 Only thing I'm rooting for is a good game...
Jags have no one to blame but themselves for NE getting back in game.   For all the good they've done, last drive was a hot mess btwn flags and clock mgmt.
@etinca Shhhh... let's keep that between us (and any other geezers who know)... 😂
@dannyboycane13 Yes, though I'd say NYG front 4 was a little better. Remember those NASCAR packages they'd run?...

Yes. Marcus Williams missed a critical tackle in a crucial game.  More important: tackling the postgame media onslaught with  the poise, maturity &amp; sportsmanship we all want from our role models.   Remember that. Share it with your kids.   Respect, @Babymagik32. #Saints

@getoffmyjock @The_Real_Rosey Very good point. Frost grew up in Lincoln, and when he transferred to NU from Stanford, grew very close with Tom Osborne, a relationship still strong to this day.
@The_Real_Rosey 🐢 🐢 🐢
@The_Real_Rosey That's a very admirable quality, Rosey! 😊
@jwhittaker86 Respectfully disagree, Jason. I covered Scott when he played there. He helped engineer the school's last National Championship. Because of his "native son" status, he'll have more rope than most to rebuild the Huskers. Plus, he has incredible coaching lineage to draw from!
@The_Real_Rosey That mentality also completely dismisses the impact Frost had on the program... and the university.
@The_Real_Rosey That's life. And ambition. No different from anyone in any field leaving one company for an opportunity at another!
The easy thing for Scott Frost to do, with his Nebraska Power 5 gig locked in? Say nothing.  But he's continued to stump for @UCF_Football &amp; expressed frustration abt Knights being frozen out of Playoff.   #Respect

@TMatich Hi, Trev! Honestly, Baker's grit and drive remind me of Tebow, but NFL teams are still hellbent on pursuing prototypical pocket passers a la Rosen/Darnold. Russ Wilson is rare exception.   What do u think?
No quit in Baker Mayfield. What an incredible game.  Tell you what... Sugar Bowl has a tough act to follow...
Crazy how much quicker to the ball Georgia's D has been in the 2nd half. Like night and day...  #Dawgs #RoseBowl
Thank you. ✅ https://t.co/DH2sLJdK4w
@SAINTTLF True, but Fromm had a couple good throws on that drive.

@JHova_Witness They're down 10. Not 21!!
Georgia has 3 monster backs that can chew up clock and keep Mayfield and Co. off field.  Soooo, you keep throwing the ball... why??  #RoseBowl
@VagabondGuru @nyjets That he did, Matthew. On the air. Off the air. In every day life...

.@yun Army won Army-Navy game last year for 1st time since 2001. But they did *not* win the Commander-In-Chief's trophy, awarded to best team among the 3 military academies that field FB teams (Army, Navy, Air Force). #NowYouKnow https://t.co/snJNqpdbvb

@SamuelBStowers They didn't win the Commander-in-Chief's trophy for best team among the military academies. Air Force claimed that.

@jemelehill Don't entirely, disagree, my friend. Esp when you consider Big Ten is arguably as good, if not better than SEC this year
@joemarquart @jemelehill Committee chair has said, ad infinitum, on public record, the purpose of league titles. I can only share what I've heard as someone who covers college football.
@WLagrenouille Lol... Well, "eye test" is also what gave Ohio St the nod last year over B1G Champ Penn State, so...
.@jemelehill They don't (except to fans). Committee's said all along conference titles are most useful in "tiebreaker" situations. https://t.co/ik1j1I1cj8
CFP Chairman Kirby Hocutt just explained this, saying committee's held Bama in high regard all year.   Translation: "Eye test" more important than schedule. #CFBPlayoff https://t.co/hJomTVRdFm
@Wsons To be honest, I see both sides of the coin. Very glad I didn't have to make that decision!!
One other note on Bama...   Just as committee excused Clemson for losing to Cuse bc Tigers' QB was hurt, they know Tide had several key players on D banged up 2nd half of season. They'll be ready to go come Playoff time.
The most emphatic statement the #CFBPlayoff just made, putting Alabama at #4...  They want the four BEST, not deserving, teams in the Playoff.
OHMYGOD.  Stop with the graphics and chatter.  GET TO #4, PLEASE...
@bschwartz07 @jetsyanks06 That's NCAA headquarters, Not CFP. NCAA has nothing to do with College Football Playoff.
.@jetsyanks06 College Football Playoff home office is actually in Dallas.   But let's not allow facts to get in  the way of your narrative. https://t.co/Zb1VbjUMlU
If there's 1 thing I understand may trip folks up, it's that Bama was ranked #1 or #2 all year until losing to Auburn. If committee wasn't impressed w Tide's schedule/opponents, then why the high ranking?   Valid point.
@billw249 Haha... that may just make me a little crazy 💙 #LGM
@Studley They really need to get rid of those powder puff games 2nd to last week of season...
@mhowell1972 You can still love someone and disagree with their viewpoints.
You're mention 2 items committee literally NEVER considers:   1)Where a team's ranked from 1 week to next   2) What any team did last year.  Bonus: I have no SEC narrative. I'm from New Jersey. 👊 https://t.co/7jncirVV8w
@JHall_Sports And why is that?
@sprtjnkie Previous years don't matter. What matters are the resumes and all the situations around those games committee is examining THIS year
@JHall_Sports Doesn't matter. They play each other.
@BeastofSE How am I biased?
My #CFBPlayoff Final 4:   CLEM UGA  OU OSU  ➤For committee: SOS + wins vs ranked teams &gt; losses  ➤Hard pressed to incl 2 SEC teams w Bama's "meh" sked  ➤Conf champ serves as "tiebreaker" when debating 2 tms. Buckeyes have it. Tide doesn't

First 3 spots in Playoff should be Clemson, Georgia, Oklahoma.  Yes, Tigers' loss at SYR &lt; UGA's loss at AUB, but Clemson better SOS,  better road wins, &amp; beat AUB, as well.

@schu47 No. Wisconsin in if they win. Bama's strength of sked mediocre, at best, this year. And no matter how you slice it, going undefeated is hard.

Right now, the best, and only choice for Tennessee should be Tee Martin.   Don't whine about his lack of head coaching experience. That ship sailed.
@JoeStatMan64 @UCF_Football Scott's done an incredible job turning UCF around. But even he knows his team is a victim of its schedule.

.@Teacherboy9499 The reality is... yes, OU has an electric offense. Yes, Wisconsin is undefeated.  But Clemson and Auburn are the most *balanced* teams in CFB. https://t.co/sn4dWj4nry

@ShaunMichael80 Someone just told told me a friend told him you watched your college roommate force himself upon a girl he brought back to your freshman college dorm room. You didn’t report him. I’m now gonna demand your current boss fire you. Cool?
@ShaunMichael80 You accuse someone of rape. No allegation anywhere of this. You accuse me of defending a rapist. Ludicrous and insulting. Pls work on educating yourself as much as you work on your lats. Or delete your account.
@Mbswolf Good for you, Matthew!! 💪
@AuthorDB_Hall @travis_helton @YeomenRon What company do I work for? Please do your research. Thank you!
@dayonep1 I don't work for ESPN.
@travis_helton Both Peyton and Schiano have been accused. Both have denied wrongdoing. Neither was ever charged.
@travis_helton @YeomenRon Have you jettisoned Peyton Manning after the sexual harassment accusations against him?
@dayonep1 Out of curiosity, what corporation do I work for?
@BryanLynch27 Interesting you say that. Because he turned around 1 of arguably the worst Power 5 programs in the country into a winning team.
@travis_helton Are you seriously trying to compare a double murder trial to hearsay?
@BryanLynch27 Would you feel differently if he helped resurrect the program and got Tennessee back into the championship conversation?
@Evan_lemieux Apples/oranges... There are myriad accounts of wrongdoing by Weinstein.
Been reading what's been unfolding at Tennessee.   Please forgive me if I missed this, but was Greg Schiano convicted of something?

@CauseMofoSaidSo They're not busted at all! Not all wins and losses are created equal, the committee looks at so much more than that
@MLarsonSports Could not agree more, Mike. One of my fav coaches ever. Just think NU's a tough place to go "cold," i.e.- no real connection to university, no recruiting pipeline
@thenotoriouspng That's fair, but I also look at his coaching lineage (Osborne, Parcells, Belichick, Chip) and that he had a lot of responsibility at Oregon
So many people cryin on my timeline last cpl of weeks.   "No way a 2-loss team CAN make the Playoff!!"  "No way a 2-loss team WILL make the Playoff!"  Get ready, folks. 2017 might be the year.

@kingjames_alan It’s not, in that Penn State won the league and didn’t go. Just like Miami could potentially win the league, and not go.

.@EddieTimanus Ohio State wasn’t even IN the B1G Championship last year and made the Playoff!! https://t.co/6DfOefK37R
.@Stealthpirate38 Uhhh... Clemson’s loss to Syracuse (w/o it’s QB) WAY more “fluke” than OSU dropping to eventual B1G Champ last yr. https://t.co/Um78uDlTJo
.@dgrug2312 Disagree 100%. If Clemson plays well in ACC Champ, but loses close gm down stretch, decent shot they’re in. Road wins/SOS &gt; than Canes + Syr loss came much earlier in yr https://t.co/oMU7NGD8KM
With Clemson/Miami each now owning a bad loss, it’s entirely possible Canes win ACC Champ... but Clemson, *not* Miami, gets into Playoff.  (See: Penn State last year)

@TPizur In your mind, absolutely... only problem is, you're not on the committee 😊
@dgrug2312 Miami? Absolutely. Clemson? No way.
@GregoS1119 @AB670 There shouldn't even be a coaches poll!! They're so singularly focused on teams on their schedules... you really think they know what's going on anywhere else?
@mikegraf_pc Your tweet made me cringe, lol. Cupcake Saturday in the bane of my college football existence
@MikeZimmersEars Well, does that mean an undefeated team from the Big South should make the Playoff?? :)
@GregoS1119 @AB670 Last year's championship plays no role in this year's rankings...
@AB670 Clemson has much better strength of schedule, road wins vs ranked teams. Fact is, they're 1 of most balanced teams in country &amp; committee knows Tigers lost their QB during Syr loss
@Astro_Oxx Miami didn't *easily* beat Virginia. In fact, Wahoos' mediocre offense was having its way early w the Canes D that made ND look silly last week!
@JonBlumenthal So many things factor into this, esp how SEC and ACC Championships play out...
@row999 Offensively, no. But Michigan's defense was suffocating UW early in the game and Hornibrook started improving as game went on.
New #CFP rankings: Bama, Clemson, Miami, Oklahoma    Even after taking down ranked team (Michigan), Wisconsin remains #5. Gonna be interesting next cpl of weeks for #Badgers

Tip for young broadcasters calling games:   Silence is not the enemy! Don’t feel you need to fill every second with words. “Laying out” for a moment gives viewers a beat to process what you’re saying.

@309_jay @slmandel Wouldn't focus so much on the W-L record, bc not all wins and losses are created equal. And the committee dives into all of that minutae

Ugh. #Wolverines Brandon Peters carted off the field. Such a talented young man...   And now UM's back to O'Korn. QB carousel revolves again...  #MICHvsWIS
@Kyle_Crook They actually have been. But they've had very few long drives and getting crushed in TOP. Can't run the ball if you're not on the field...
Wisconsin's offense ain't doin itself any favors today in the Badgers' pursuit of a CFP bid.
Most broadcasters will never experience the rare combo that was @MikeAndMike: raw chemistry, trust, long-term commitment from an employer, rope to experiment, evolve &amp; be themselves.  Congrats on 18 yrs, @Espngreeny @espngolic . Will miss you starting my mornings!

@kohalloran25 Tell them I said hello!
@CarlDemark Lololololol... that's what I love. Completely unbiased commentary. 😂
@Shadyplace20 Fair! But Mich St win looks better today after they upset Penn St. And if Miami con't to play well and ND beats them, bodes well for Irish,
@kohalloran25 Exactly why I used quotes. A close loss vs a good tm can net out as neutral or even a win to humans on committee, depending on scenario!
@helmick_michael Why, thank you, Michael. Nice change of pace from all the cyber-flipoffs I get when I try to employ logic on Twitter 😊
@SunTimesSports Would be tough, bc they already have 2 losses...
.@QuagMeyer6791 True. At time, Mich St not ranked, but Sparty beating Michigan/Penn St wld certainly boost that ND win in committee's eyes https://t.co/g5a4qtL5oz
Sorry, folks... Yes.  ND "lost" to UGA. But by 1 pt. If Irish run table, will have wins over USC, NC State, Miami, Stanf. Very strong resume
.@FoundV That's what logic tells us, Peter. But an undefeated Notre Dame potentially throws a wrench in "logic"... https://t.co/lySXRi7Q21
@DanHampton8 Georgia beat Notre Dame. In South Bend.
Ohio St (Iowa), Penn St (Mich St) losing not only bad for those tms, but bad for Wisco. Need strong opp in B1G title gm to aid playoff hopes
Seldom few sideline reporters lend *context* to a moment like Holly Rowe. Grt Dexter Lawrence injury report just now in #CLEMvsNCSU game...
Really impressed with Iowa's defense today. Some airtight pass coverage and timely plays up front...  #OSUvsIOWA #Hawkeyes
Bedlam.   Defense not included.   #OUvsOSU
@darealjlaw @RayDiBrango Uhhh... look at who Ohio State played. UNLV? Rutgers? Maryland? C'mon. (And I'm a Terps alum!) #CmonMan
@FlapJackNorton Judging entire body of work. Quality of competition major factor in considering Heisman candidates.
@FlapJackNorton Nebraska's B1G wins only entail sub-.500 teams. Their defense is among worst in conference. Your point?
@FlapJackNorton @RayDiBrango See: Oklahoma.
.@RayDiBrango Not sure why 1 game put him on list in 1st place. Can't discount his crucial role in amazing comeback vs PSU, but... just 1 gm https://t.co/dIQ9VEyfDO

@Carolinacoug Not by me
K- another quick question for gun experts: how easy is it to modify a legal semi-automatic to make it automatic? Appreciate the insight
@KyleRohde This was very interesting, Kyle... thank you.
Not guns expert, so asking genuinely:  R automatic weapons legal in US? If not &amp; they're acquired illegally, does "gun control" apply to LV?
@JasonLoyd @Martina From what I've read (not an expert!), they were illegal weapons. If they were already banned, does gun control discussion apply here?
With respect to *this* case, @Martina? When investigators compile a profile of the shooter. Without that, we're just making assumptions. https://t.co/YteWaI0urK
@mboyeast Where did I say we should never have that conversation?
@b_mcguire @SullivanJ2000 Well taken, Brian and wholeheartedly agree! My only point was to show compassion for now... and take action when all the facts come in.
@gregwaks Absolutely, Greg!! But let's have an informed discussion once investigators compile a full work up on the shooter.
@Patrick83555534 Am I really, lol? Just seems like common sense! But, thank you, Patrick
@theonetheonlyn8 Indeed, sir. All we can try to do is bring compassion and sensibility, right?...
@lettergirl Not a lecture at all! It's being responsible. As a journalist, I try to not make assumptions, but await facts before making assessments
I'm being lectured by the Twitterverse this morning that prayer means nothing in times of tragedy.   Happy Monday.   #PrayersForVegas
@Mtngrwn Might wanna re-read your initial tweet before you speak of snark, my friend. Hypocrisy at its finest. Congrats!
@mitchumms Shouldn't we be working every day to do this?
@Mtngrwn Ooh. Good one. Witty. Feel good about yourself?

At this VERY moment? Death toll still rising? Families desperately trying to find loved ones? Investigators gathering details? #TimeAndPlace https://t.co/1lvwrSf8AH
@mitchumms What part of "for now" does not resonate with you?
@b_mcguire @SullivanJ2000 Brian- do you think investigators have, in a matter of hours, gathered all the information there is to gather abt the shooter/weapons?
Let's not make assumptions abt the shooter.  Or scream about gun control.  For now, simply Pray for Vegas. That's where our energy is needed
@LauverPatrick You'd have a decent shot at that if you at least try to swat the ball. But nooooo... 😕
@KyleWGreene Hmmm. D is better side of the ball, but dinged up. Off has ton of talent at skill positions but no OL. Can I coach the water boys, lol?
@msjmcglynn If I didn't love Minions so much, this woulda made me mad, lol.

@hmich176 @CMJIsTheMan Oh, so spot on, Harry!
@hmich176 He is a gem. A joy to watch!
@jbach2121 You proudly display UNC logo on your account. You can support a team hit for NCAA academic violations, but not immature (legal) behavior? 🤔
@MichiGing @TrumpHaikus2 😂
@JasonLoyd Indeed. And still has his moments. Like that crybaby BS he pulled on the sideline a few minutes ago
@CMJIsTheMan And if he earned you Ws, you know what you'd say? "He's an ahole, but he's my ahole. I'll keep him." And you'd praise his undeniable talent.
@stevelthm Then you're looking for a choir boy, not a baller.
Love him or loathe him, you can't deny you'd want OBJ on your team if you could get him.   Dude's a gamer. #NYGvsTB
Please help me understand why any tackler wld just try to ram a guy  w/o trying to wrap him up.   Unacceptable in the NFL. #DRC #NYGvsTB

@3BenJammin Haven't seen 1 of his games yet, but reading good reviews :)

61  Flipping  Yards  Have a day, Jake Elliott.   #Eagles https://t.co/Fc02S0Vslk
3 minutes + timeouts + 2 minute warning = eternity for Eagles.
@WestTxCoach I'm old school. I'd prefer scoring and handing ball of to zebra. That said, I want him on my team! 💙
...aaand then he blows ur mind w *another* 1-handed beauty in the end zone.   Mad skills. Maddening behavior.   You can have both. #OBJ #NYG
In a span of 15 secs, OBJ miraculously gets 2 feet in for a TD, then does something incredibly stupid.   Stop me if you've seen this movie.
@d_ba11a_13 Take your banged up defense out of it. Covered OBJ and Sterling Shepard closely in college. Extremely gifted. Not debatable.

@RB_Mrs @KNegandhiESPN Yes... the scribbling thing, too!! (though that's poss on today's tablets, too)... #OldSkool

@FlyKfcm @KNegandhiESPN What do you do for a living?
@DamarisBruce @KNegandhiESPN Same. Plus easier to find other places in script. But I want to save tress, lol.
@redskins221 @AtlantaFalcons Last time I checked, an owner doesn't allow a statement to go out on his behalf without owner approval. Have a great day!
Biz question: See @KNegandhiESPN using iPad 4 scripts instead of hard copy. Always worry tablet will crash! Thoughts, fellow broadcasters?
Thanks for the open and respectful conversation today, Tweeps. Let's keep setting the example.  Good night.

@Melissa47621845 I'd never do that. Can't imagine that pain. Respect her personal love for flag. But I don't respect military sacrifice any less than she.
@309_470 How nice would it be to have a competitive SEC Championship this year?!?
@Melissa47621845 We're not free bc of a flag. We're free bc of incredible ppl like your family members who selflessly served.   So, again, do I need to move?
Georgia defense = LEGIT   Kirby Smart startin to put his stamp on this #Bulldogs program. #MSUvsUGA
@ninersfan16 Thx, Todd... you, too
@bar545 I'd encourage you to do more research on this, Barry. Lots of athletes &amp; influencers trying to make real impact with their platforms 🙁
@Melissa47621845 I'm forever grateful for military &amp; law enforcement. Thank them every time I see them! But I don't link flag to military. Do I need to move?
@bar545 @losmansports Uh, how many mass shootings took place in inner cities? Orlando nightclub? Charleston? Fort Hood? Sandy Hook? Aurora movie theatre?
@Melissa47621845 @losmansports I don't deny your right to feel that way, Melissa! Nor should anyone else. But not everyone views the flag as you do.
@DCurtsinger Agree 100%

.@losmansports Everyone's entitled to their views. It's ok to respectfully disagree. Not ok to condemn/attack those who don't align w you https://t.co/ZUi6jbRSXi

@kwilliams0687 So if you think athletes should stay out of politics, do you feel politicians should stay out of sports?
@kwilliams0687 Do you think the owner and football players on your favorite team all align with your political beliefs?
@kwilliams0687 So you're saying if the owner of your lifelong team doesn't condemn kneeling, but your team goes to Super Bowl, you won't watch?
@Adeliciousbass5 Jackson took big hit vs Clemson last week, IMO...
@gguerry77 It's imp to note Kaep's not a fit for most offenses. Not a pocket passer, OL needs to hold longer blocks for option QBs like him. Big factor
Gritty, clutch Big 12 road win for TCU. Tho 'Pokes certainly made a run...  Tweeps, how do u think this affects Mason Rudolph Heisman hopes?
@gguerry77 The reality is, if Kaepernick was Tom Brady, he'd have a job. If he was Aaron Rodgers, he'd have a job. He's not. So he doesn't.

@RichardPanetta @AmyTrask I get it. But chances are, grumbling didn't just start during the regular season. So imp for front office to always have pulse of players.
@AmyTrask Hi!! Back atchya sister :)
@DisBePaul @AmyTrask Nothin to do w it. If team lacked faith in Zampese in off-season, 86 him then &amp; give new OC opp to settle in. Marvin put in tough situation
@GeraldWWhite How would you feel if you paid you dues in your job, worked your tail off for a promotion, and then someone w no experience got that gig?
.@AmyTrask spot on here. Front offices need to be more aware + less reactive to public. Appeasing fans can't fuel FB decisions. #Bengals https://t.co/mOKvATN27w

@lionsFan886 Tada! Civilized conversation and balanced resolution. How novel, lol! Have a great day &amp; thanks for reaching out. Stay safe out there!
@lionsFan886 And as I consider officers may have felt they were pursuing active shooter, I'd ask u not assume "majority" of media supports player. Fair?
@lionsFan886 Totally get that. Unfortunately, while video will be helpful, but there's not audio there to hear what commands may have been issued...
@lionsFan886 Seriously have so much admiration for law enforcement/military, and hate to see bad seeds in uniform makin it hard for the rest of you!
@lionsFan886 No offense taken. Promise :)
@lionsFan886 That was my thought, as well.   Thank you for your service!
@DisBePaul You bet, Paul! Happy to always have healthy debate. Enjoy your afternoon :)
@lionsFan886 You are correct, sir! My error. But union calling out NFL is perplexing. Shouldn't its own investigation on officers' behalf net out facts?
@DisBePaul You have a vivid imagination. Perhaps it's worth trying to put it to good use!   Perhaps water painting, lol. Soothing for the soul...
@jrb802 @DisBePaul I haven't seen every piece of video yet. Have you? And if so, can you please share all of it? Thanks!

@paulbenick77 @bueb61 Why does that matter?
.@bueb61 Diff, but same question. NFL has nothin to do w Bennett's alleged actions. Wld union go after UPS if 1 of its drivers was detained? https://t.co/WCixUEEWU3
@ChiTownCheese I do, but neither's relevant here. Facts that matter: behavior leading to detainment, and actions that took place during that time.
@Dan_B_Phin_Phan As in so many cases, w/o vid evidence of whole incident, from when shots allegedly fired to pt he was released, only ppl involved know truth
@TheLandino7 @_CodesMcGodes @Vanessa_Murphy @LVMPD @nflcommish @mosesbread72 @LVPPA @8NewsNow Hmmm. News to me. And my better half, lol...
@DisBePaul Oh, Paul. Not surprised u assumed a tweet asking a question meant I'm not aware of the he said/he said. But thx for ignorantly chiming in! 👍

@dgmccready You always have a choice of who you do and don't follow, though!
Was a little worried re: Francois after early hits he took. OL seems settled in, though + QB quick release on point... #BamaVsFSU
.@SI_PeterKing Don't you love stay-in-your-lane tweets?  Esp bc 99% percent of those folks tweet about everything OTHER than their jobs... https://t.co/AdVjUslDww
@mikeinbama You need to get out more.
.@JJWatt doing what you'd hope every pro athlete wld wanna do. Leverage his platform to make a *real* difference in his community.  Bravo! https://t.co/w3p9fKgkMS
Moments like this make the game even more special than it already is. https://t.co/0TkOUNUwwT
.@Joemccrabb Such a fantastic visual. I'll never see Michigan's all yellows the same away again, lol... #Frenchies https://t.co/9gAGDaBdQB
.@PhinsChris I know in NFL you can catch your own pass if someone else touches it first. Not sure about college... https://t.co/bxTHZYi7Up
So... ummm... how's that play scored? Hurts deflected pass to... Hurts? #BAMAvsFSU
Francois can juke a little. Nice footwork. #FSUvsBAMA #Seminoles
Southern Tweeps: really need your help here. Do you call our Gameday feast "Frogmore Stew" (RT) or "Low Country Boil" (Like). #Charleston https://t.co/M84SzPEP7Q
Halftime of #MICHvsFLA... and my mind is blown. Never seen anything like this!! Have you?   #GamedayProps 🍷 https://t.co/GTve2MJy2N
@truthhurtsports We'll take it! I was sweatin it for a bit...
.@jdsanto I resemble that remark. 🐢 https://t.co/EVb1mEpdQb
@DerekBT24 As much as I love my school, I've always wondered if the designers of the state flag had a major identity crisis 😊
I'll take Maryland's helmets any day over these Michigan uniforms. #GlowStickYellow
Am I the only #Terps alum who assumed Jake Funk was Fred Funk's kid?
The number of near picks in this game is astounding... #Terps #UMDvsTEX
Dear Longhorns Return Team: Step away from the Vaseline. #dropsies
@LisaE116 Lol...
3rd and 19... the MONEY down! 🐢🏈🐢🏈🐢 #Terps  Seriously-- if we lose this game, I'm gonna puke. #UMvsUT

Hoosiers up early, 7-3.  This does not alter one iota my prognostication Buckeyes win easily.  Anyone watching feel differently? #OSUvsIND
CFL Tiger-Cats drop Art Briles. "We made a large, serious mistake."  Translation: Who knew that Baylor news wld make its way to Canada? Smh.
Not like we need any more reasons to admire + respect @JJWatt, but...  #HoustonStrong donate #Texans https://t.co/RJxBnDPabm
Good morning, Houston Tweeps... just checkin in on you.  How are you holding up? #HoustonStrong 💪 👊

@jbach2121 What's her name, btw?
@RDSolutions11 Lol. I think it's more likely snowballs freeze in hell before Bama doesn't make the Playoff, but stranger things... 😊
@MDTaurus That is fantastic! 🐢 🐢 🐢
@rynostrosa @HealthierGen Great to hear... and to see so many Texas schools getting #HealthiestSchools props!!
.@buffetman 1) Better 2 face strong non-conf opp Wk 1 than when more in-sync latr on. 2) CFP tends 2b more forgiving for early season losses https://t.co/kNcFsguko7

Nearly 2,500 votes on my #MayweathervMcgregor Poll. 70% don't give a flip abt the fight.   Where do you stand? VOTE: https://t.co/EI56GMF9Vc https://t.co/8DWxc7x2Oy
Any of my Tweeps have kids' at 1 of these schools?  Such an imp initiative teaching youngsters to be active + eat well! 👏  🍎 @HealthierGen https://t.co/R9iw7SkLJk
@CoachB_Rad Your tweet makes no sense. Go back and look at the 3 tweets prior to that on my thread that day. Apology accepted.
#MayweatherMcGregor Poll: Who's ponying up $100 to watch this fight? And if you're watching, who u rootin for?  Personally: I'm passing.
@WayneNichols12 Totally get it. But why put key players at risk by playing them in a game that means nothing?
.@CoachB_Rad Interesting question, Coach.  If it's not a high stakes gm, doesn't bother me 1 bit. But If your team's in CFP, you gotta play. https://t.co/X8ekcmLqQS
Wooooohooooo! 🏈❤️🏈❤️🏈❤️🏈 https://t.co/PmgiL3j7yu
@BryanLukes Regular season matters. Preseason doesn't. It's terrible football and unnecessary in 2017 bc these guys train year round...
@SnookApeNolo Tore mine, too. Not crazy swelling. Could still bike. Docs didn't think it was torn. It was.
@7_Icy_2 This happens very frequently w ACLs in particular...
"Patriots' Edelman tears ACL" = reason #263 why the preseason is dumb for anyone other than players trying to make a roster.
Teared up reading @KarlTowns' piece in @PlayersTribune. Fellow NJ native w poignant, powerful words abt our country: https://t.co/8LgwBSB2ZC
@robrod76 Yikes. Please be safe, Rob!
Love football, but NFL preseason pales in comparison to Weather Channel right now.  Side by side shots of Katrina &amp; #HurricaneHarvey. Whoa. https://t.co/Q6iklTPSiL

Just wanna thank you, again, for all the kind bday tweets.  Not able to respond to every one, but pls know each is equally appreciated! 💗
@NYC49J @TomLeyden That's ok, they've had a little bit o' success since 1986. Helluva lot more than the Mets... *sigh*
@UnoriginalSynn 🐢 🐢 🐢
@AsaniEntertain Very sweet, thank you!
@Jedimaster46 Thanks so much, Don!
@CPIZZAIA @TomLeyden I'm 15 in my head. So there's that, lol...

@adnanESPN You're killin me, Cinemasaurus. I'm vacillating between Big Sick and Dunkirk... and you've now recommended both. Sheesh 😬
@Richard14407640 @sportsreporters Some games are so bad, *anyone's* tweets are better than the game, lol...
@micecchini @PatrickClaybon @Kevin747747 Appreciate that, sir!

.@wesblalock85 Totally get this opinion. But some argue a team's only *real* fam for some of these kids &amp; dismissal leaves em in worse shape https://t.co/uZYHdgW7CF
@ShemiRock Ummm... :)
@TonyBruin Agreed on that. But 7 players can do some major damage...
@mboyeast Many coaches may have split up suspensions or found some other punishment than benching so there's less risk of a loss.
Major cojones for #Gators McElwain to susp 7 kids for Michigan gm.   But no better wake up call than benching + prob tickin off ur teammates
@jmp_nyc LOL... thx for the morning chuckle, Jeremy 👍
Disney pulls plug on Netflix streaming deal.   Netflix steals Shonda Rhimes from ABC.   What a juicy battle this rivalry is becoming... 😮

Me: "Ohhh, it's Left-Handers Day!"  Mom: "They say left-handers are highly intelligent people."  Me: *hugs Mom* (I'm a lefty, lol) #MomsRule
@PatrickClaybon Neither spiteful, nor a joke. There's truth in age old adage "You don't know what you got til it's gone." School+sports is hard. So is life.
@PatrickClaybon @Kevin747747 @micecchini PS- thx for reading thru all of them! More than what most do...
@PatrickClaybon @Kevin747747 @micecchini Given my unique perspective, initially walk-on/working during school, then reaping benefits of scholarship, 100% comfortable w my tweets 😊
@PatrickClaybon @Kevin747747 @micecchini Dismissed replies abt/related to whether athletes shld be paid. Diff convo than balancing school/sports, lack of gratitude for free educ.
Catchin up on CFB pods.  @ESPNRittenberg jokingly envisions world where Johnny Manziel coaches for Lane Kiffen.  Literally spit my gum out 😂
@PatrickClaybon @Kevin747747 @micecchini But you know what is, Patrick? Actually reading the full thread of my tweets, so u have context on the final tweet you commented on. Try it!
@NucksNiners Any time! (And thx for the bday wishes @brooklynfritzy...) https://t.co/5U9hE8ERbs
