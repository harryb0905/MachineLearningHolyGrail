Not to mention other media picking up those skewed pieces and, even worse, using them as guidance!! By doing so, @nytimes is spreading more ignorance that will lead to more bloodshed! @YousefMunayyer https://t.co/lgoZe1r4FE
@NPRinskeep @lisang Just to be clear, I wasn’t suggesting no one should read Friedman’s piece. I read both and replied to you highlighting the importance of nuance. You did recommend the opinion without context, giving it credence on Gaza. At least you offered the rebuttal, thanks for that. Allbest
@NPRinskeep @972mag It’s the equal credence you gave the opinions that made me cringe. I’m truly glad you shared Lisa’s rebuttal but I believe it’s important to identify Friedman for what he is, a government mouthpiece. The masses will never know the difference unless we say it. Story of my life!!
@NPRinskeep Undoubtedly! She’s a true journalist. Btw her @972mag is by far my favorite Israeli news source. Thanks for engaging Steve.
@lisang Check out my response to  @NPRinskeep who generously shared both. You’d be a great guest on @NPR if you haven’t been already. Moderate voices are extremely important in these politicized times. Nuance is key but drowned out by so much hateful and racist noise!
@NPRinskeep I was responding to your tweet. These two opinions are not compatible to share (as you have done) as an opinion and rebuttal to inform the masses. The former is serving the government’s skewed opinion while the latter is a serious informed independent journalist stating facts.
@NPRinskeep I have the utmost respect for Lisa Goldman, a fair journalist I have followed for years and no respect for Matti Friedman who is only echoing the Israeli government racist statements justifying their aggression. Alas this very important nuance is lost on many including you Steve!
@AviMayer From Hamas doesn’t mean they’re militants. The point is Israel would use this quote to justify killing Palestinians when we all know who has Israel been killing! It’s very nuanced as always in that region &amp; parading this quote only adds to the confusion.
@AviMayer This is a tightly edited soundbite. He’s saying “let’s say that 63 were martyred today and 50 of them are Hamas” then he’s cut off. With any of these “proofs” I’d ask to hear it for myself in full with context. That’s the responsible thing to do!
