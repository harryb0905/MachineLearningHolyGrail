OK, it's time for us to sign off but thank you to everyone who joined us, especially @megleder. We loved the book + hope all of you did too!
So do we! And that makes total sense. #LCBookClub https://t.co/i8e2iFNJZn
Q for @MegLeder: Fashion plays a big role, and Pen especially loves vintage. How was this detail was important to her character? #LCBookClub
To answer that one ourselves, we didn't predict it exactly, but it also didn't surprise us.
Another question for everyone: Did any of you predict that Keats would cheat on Pen with Cherisse? #LCBookClub
That is so true. #LCBookClub https://t.co/c3MRdZ3FIg
Depending on the situation, they can be equally heartbreaking. #LCBookClub https://t.co/OV7QXgF0GD
So heartbreaking! #LCBookClub https://t.co/aQ0FSRxM15
We would have been so mad! Audrey should have seen how horrible Cherisse was at that point. #LCBookClub https://t.co/kZAWigLWAq
.@MegLeder Was it hard to write the scene when Eph discovers his father is cheating? That was sort of heartbreaking to witness. #LCbookclub
We see a future for Pen and Eph though. Some of the strongest relationships start out as friendships. #LCBookClub https://t.co/roKMqM79yg
Keats and cherisse will probably be short-lived, like most high school relationships. #LCBookClub https://t.co/roKMqM79yg
Didn't we all... :-) #LCBookClub https://t.co/86fxjzfLIx
We hope they'll learn something and grow from the experience but stay best friends.  #LCBookClub https://t.co/EfN0jnP5q7
Yes! https://t.co/0Ta99Xgi0d
Here's a question we have for @megleder: Were any parts of the book inspired by events from your own high school experience? #LCbookclub
We were Team Eph all along, even when Pen was so enamored by Keats. Some of the best relationships start off as friendships. #LCBookClub
We loved the book and hope you did too! Let's start with a question for everyone: Team Eph or Team Keats... #LCBookClub
We'll be asking Meg some questions and sharing discussion questions for everyone who read along with us. #LCBookClub

We'll take one last question before we wrap up our #LCbookclub...
Such good advice... We're going to have to try that next time :-) #LCbookclub https://t.co/1Tdu5cHZQG
Our cure for writer's block is taking a short walk or getting outside. Writing always seems to flow much easier after a break! #LCbookclub
.@morgan_m During the writing process, do you ever get writer's block? What's your cure, if any? #LCbookclub
Another question for @morgan_m...
We love that your own high school experience inspired this story and it's characters! #LCbookclub https://t.co/av8wlfCIe7
We think this story is a pretty accurate portrayal of high school: falling in love, dealing with friends, and first summer jobs. #LCbookclub
.@morgan_m How is the story of #TheUnexpectedEverything similar or different to your own high school experience? #LCbookclub
And now a question for our author, @morgan_m...
We think Topher seemed like he wished he had pursued Andie when he had the chance.  #LCbookclub https://t.co/ycp3cf7N4g
Our best advice is to try to let your friends work it out with each other without getting in the middle #LCbookclub https://t.co/bqhzlRf5Eb
We think if you're dating someone your friend has a crush on, it's better to be honest and up front. #LCbookclub https://t.co/m8w65MIxGi
We identify the most with Palmer because she tried to keep the peace in the group when there was drama. #LCbookclub https://t.co/tpAcOgItEK
We thought that Clark wasn't going to come back around as easily as he did. Andie said hurtful words! #LCbookclub https://t.co/9LE1s6U5IP
We think that both Andie and her dad continue to keep letting down walls and getting closer.  #LCbookclub https://t.co/8AanAeLVnm

One more question from us for @siobhanvivian! Have you ever been in a natural disaster? How did you come up with the flood idea? #LCBookClub
Keeley matured a lot over the course of the book. So even though it surprised us it made sense for her. #LCbookclub https://t.co/9G82nhlc6Q
It was almost post-apocalyptic. But in a way it did end up being the end of the world as Keeley knew it #LCbookclub https://t.co/zF8edN5pbO
We connected with Morgan and Levi the most. They were both patient, understanding, and mature. #LCbookclub https://t.co/wUlUwbfBJN
.@siobhanvivian, how much of #thelastboyandgirlintheworld was based off of experienced you had in high school #LCBookClub
We're also so lucky to have the author @siobhanvivian joining us for this #LCbookclub live chat. Time for us to ask her a question...
Our least favorite was when Keeley's dad lost them all the money from the adjusters' original offer. #LCbookclub https://t.co/QqqwTZ2zwA
Our favorite part was the Spring Fling scene with Keeley and Jesse dancing in the rain. So romantic! #LCbookclub https://t.co/QqqwTZ2zwA
Keeley took advantage of how good a friend Levi was. But in the end she tried to redeem herself. #LCbookclub https://t.co/Wl3mnvHmgP
We think he got very carried away. He meant well, but we were very frustrated with how he  reacted. #LCbookclub https://t.co/uegIdk42ns
We think Keeley's dad's character developed the most over the course of the story. Would you agree? #LCbookclub https://t.co/6lBQLkRjTT
We also aren't ready to be done with the Keeley/Levi love story. It just started! #LCbookclub https://t.co/iaAFSJRAnL
We hope there's a sequel!  We want to see if Keeley is able to mend her friendship with Morgan! #LCbookclub https://t.co/iaAFSJRAnL

@chandeliergmin It is! I love a beachy side braid, and it works for short or long hair: http://t.co/QdmMXSTY5x @johnfriedaus #jflivechat
@kittylover1313 For summer, I always say the lighter the better @JohnFriedaUS #BeachBlondeElite
@beautystat Hi! I keep my hair conditioned with the @JohnfriedaUS #BeachBlonde Conditioner. I use it every single day :-) #jflivechat
@courtneysims03 It depends but I usually get a trim every other month. Since I cut it, I get it trimmed more often @johnfriedaus #jflivechat
@reaumegenevieve You can use the @JohnFriedaUS #BeachBlonde Sea Waves Spray no matter what color hair you have :-) #jflivechat
@acfarah8 I just freshen up a few waves with my curling iron and add a spritz of the @JohnFriedaUS #SheerBlonde Hairspray #jflivechat
@katieeriley93 Right now I'm loving a red lip, but for summer I tend to go with a neutral color like soft pink @johnfriedaus #jflivechat
@DSorensen15 I grew up using @JohnFriedaUS #BeachBlonde products, so it was a natural fit for me #jflivechat
@byrdiebeauty I'll let my hair air dry, spray @JohnFriedaUS Sea Waves Spray in there &amp; tousle. Gives a great wave with no heat #jflivechat
@Melisastephens @JohnFriedaUS #BeachBlonde Sea Waves Spray keeps volume at my roots and gives my hair the perfect wave  #BeachBlondeElite
@ddpieroni I use @JohnFriedaUS #SheerBlonde Hairspray. It holds your waves but doesn't weigh your hair down #jflivechat
@justinprybo I cut my hair after my wedding. I had wanted to cut it for a while, and was excited for a change @JohnFriedaUS #jflivechat
@alexaaaleee Here's a step by step tutorial for how I get my beachy waves: http://t.co/w2bWAQUuJI @johnfriedaUS #jflivechat
@KyleLara1231 Yes, I use @JohnFriedaUS #BeachBlonde Shampoo and Conditioner! #jflivechat
@melinda74 Yes, but see a professional, do it gradually, and use @johnfriedaus #SheerBlonde to keep it looking great #BeachBlondeElite
@aprilmaariee I use a 1 1/4 inch curling iron to get my beachy waves @johnfriedaus #jflivechat
@smbarone2000 Thank you! I'm loving my shorter hair. It's so easy to style for spring and summer @johnfriedaUS #jflivechat
@kristaxo3 I always keep a pair of sunnies, some lip gloss and my iPhone in my bag. @johnfriedaus #jflivechat
@summer0001 The best way to get beachy waves is by using the @JohnFriedaUS #BeachBlonde Sea Salt Spray. It smells great, too #jflivechat
@LoveAnna111 I use @JohnFriedaUS #SheerBlonde Shampoo &amp; Conditioner to keep my blonde bright #jflivechat #beachblondeelite

@InStyle @jakesproul "I Wanna Get Better" by @bleachersmusic
@InStyle @erinicolesocial I wash my face every morning and night; use a scrub every other day; and use moisturizer and sunscreen everyday.
@InStyle @meghanhaar During summer it's definitely white denim.
@InStyle @Diahann_Hughes A great handbag because it dresses up even a casual outfit.
@InStyle @InStyleDana I think our next trip is going to be somewhere in Mexico. We're talking to a few different groups right now.
@InStyle @justinetrocchia The time spent with artisans while traveling for @TheLittleMarket. We've met so many inspiring women.
@InStyle @evanslead You can't go wrong with chinos, a button-down, and a more casual shoe like a boat shoe or a sneaker (no running shoes!)
@InStyle @houppettebeauty I love the classic cream collection that @dolcegabbana just came out with. I mix the colors together.
@InStyle @justinprybo I feel so lucky to have a job that I love. It's so much fun going to work everyday + working in a creative industry.
@InStyle @allanahjd My personal brand in 4 words: Creative, empowering, fun, and girly.
@InStyle @With_Shai My iPhone, sunglasses, and sunscreen.
@InStyle @zoeneilmeyer_ Wearable shine. It's fun to wear a little subtle sparkle and it stays on trend through holiday.
@InStyle @DearAstrid_ My guilty pleasure during the summer is Big Brother :-) I can't resist...
Chatting live with @InStyle right now. You can follow along on their feed... XO
@InStyle @rach3lgr33n 90% of the time I'm wearing at least one @LCLaurenConrad piece! My favorite pieces right now are the maxi dresses.
@InStyle @scrubsandblush I haven't used self-tanning products in a while. I've been trying to embrace my natural skin color lately.
@InStyle @nicole_perez1 Matching crop top and skirt sets. I even did a post about the crop top on @laurenconradcom.
@InStyle @maddiefox__ I don't really have one! I think style inspiration is everywhere.
