The truest words ever. https://t.co/59tjhr1MqA
At the end of the day nobody cares...so take care of YOU. Do what YOUR heart desires.
If everything was easy we’d all be bored AF. Pateince, patience, more patience and then add more patience to that part.
I wish I could shake a few of them...ish...and snap them into accepting their fears to then take a leap of faith!
It’s really dispointing to watch people with a limitless amount of talent become conformist to the boundaries that society has placed in their path.

Most of the influencers you follow have roommates and live in the Valley.

@MaggieLindemann No you areeeeeeeee. (we can do this all night 😉)
I'm going to stop tweeting about my favorite humans because I have agency reps trolling my tweets.  You know who you are...you're welcome.
So much respect to @princessnokia for doing her own thing and not shadowing the trends. Congrats on your new project!

Some influencers are like bad pictures taken on a droid.  It's all blurry and fuzzy...it makes no sense.
It doesn't! I totally agree. 🤦🏽‍♀️ https://t.co/G7VGijCEGE
Just saying. 🤷🏽‍♀️ I'm over it. https://t.co/9nnAwRUtW3
@ me, I'll wait.
Oh and last but not least...what does their reputation look like off the Internet? Are they kind? Do they have manners? You know...IRL shit.
What's their actual talent? What have they accomplished? How did they accomplish it?
If you're investing on a popular online personality make sure there's a return on your investment.
They shake a few hands and immediately think they are influential by association.  Stop it.  Sit down.
Most of the time they are full of hype and no merit.
